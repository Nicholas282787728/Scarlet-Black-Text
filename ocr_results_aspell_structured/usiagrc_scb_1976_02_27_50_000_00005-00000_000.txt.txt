Dear Mom:

I’ve just spent this last Weekend
as a guest of the Health Center.
Whether Maslow is correct and I
subconsciously or preconsciously
could not face Valentine’s Day and
the Loose Hall Ball or whether Dr.
Ferguson’s diagnosis is correct of
'imnonucleosis cum strept throat is
neither here nor there. On Friday
morning I knew I was dying of

throat cancer. ,
etween clutching Oliver (my
'ar, Mother) and moaning about
mv mommy I had all the usual
cliche thoughts about dying before
iybody in this cold impersonal
clave missed my cheery face.
Maybe, my friedrup little brain
wondered, my decomposing body
would start to reek, then they'd all
be sorry as hell, at least for the
rotten smell. Not to Worry Mom, I
was assuredly moribund before

Grinnell . . .

My next conscious moment was
in the Health Center, a little known

Furnished with two beds, two

confused with a one night stand),
two bed lamps, one sink, and the
requisite Degas print. Not the most

listening patienﬂy to your night-
mares about earthquakes and bio-
chem wierdos under the bed. But
the most endearing aspect is the
blissful quiet . . . no Beach Boys
competing with Springsteen
clashing with the kitten next door
who fears he’s been orphaned.

Being near death also allows one
the frivolous luxury of reading
frivolous magazines instead of
Leading Constitutional Decisions.
Thus, I have perused the last seven
months' worth of People, McCalls,
Time, etc. I can now tell you the
secretofPaul Newman and Joanne
Woodward's successful marriage
(and have realized for the
seventeenth time this month that I
could live out the rest of my days in
a state of extreme emotional
exaltation with Paul Newman . . .
even in Stockton, California). Ali
Maccraw, in case you’re won»
dering, is very happy with new
husband Steve MacQueen,
although Steve is fond of making
nuips about her anatomy to the
effect of “two bee stings” and
“nubby knees." of course it is
necessary to keep abreast (no pun
intended) of Jacqueline Onassis'
doings (JBO to her friends), in her
new capacity at Viking Press. I
am happy to report to you that
Jackie is iustone of the crowd over
at Viking, dresses in slacks and
jumpers, picks at her nail polish,
and reads with her feet propped up
(how middle class).

All in all it was a very
satisfactory weekend, my friends
demonstrated their devotion by
trudging over dutifully for visiting
hours, my profs all gave me a
break (although I still have to take

,tinals), and I caught up on the real
.world (Paul Newman certainly

constitutes the real world, right
Mom?). I am now recovered,
unfortunately, forced to slog to the
libs, stand in line for Saga, put up
with freshmen, and listen to a
supposed friend tell me i look like
Kate Smith (She sounds like Kate
Smith). Tell Tricia and Julie I love
them , . . and Daddy too. Your
daughter.

From my

Sometimes as I sit in my chair
beneath my lamp I age years and
years and begin seeing things
through the mist of years that have
not yet passed, the frontiers long
since traversed.

There were frontiers and pseudo-
frontiers, I blazed some and
reblazed others and then there
were some I never touched. There
was room-to move—altered states
of consciousness, theater, music,
physics. I recall an exhilaration in
sacrificing my sleep, sacred rest,
for something as removed as an
introductory paragraph that,
flowed, or a chi-square that wasn’t
miles off. There were discoveries
and rediscoveries. Some of us even
stumbled upon near-death and
knelt there at the block of some
searing loneliness or illicit
chemical.

Occasionally there was a sense
of community. something like a
colony of lost souls, lost together,
blissfully lost. We celebrated
rapturously the certain truth that
as long as we were to be young
intellectuals we would be lost. That
one certainty elicited confusion
and peace as well, the missing
peace. It was very cool to be lost
and stable at the same time.

The crises came and went, and
friends did likewise. There was a
beauty in the awkwardness with
which we undisguised our hearts to
each other; it was always such a
shock. Like, there are some people
who are hard to imagine creating a
poem, right? But we were poets.
We knew enough to watch those
sunsets and wait for the niEht
hawks’ return in May. Crises
forced us to liye poems. But crises
became a little different to me
\vhen I discovered that I would
never outgrow them, then, they
simply became something to deal
with, like a dinner for fifteen.

Student activism. The words
became hard to articulate, em-
barrassing. Something died just
before, or perhaps just after I
came. l couldn’t explain it, didn't
know what to say, didn’t know
what to do. There was a loss of
innocence that day we rallied in
Herrick before packing off to the
cities to sell McGovern to the
people, to the masses, to America.
We came home in the dark and
watched the victor T.V. smile and
triumph. I sat alone inhaling
cigarettes, feeling as if there had
just been another assassination. i
had my own wounds to nurse. My
canvassing shoes had been worn
thin and there was broken glass in
the streets those days. I wondered,
would i ever walk the pavement
again amidst tear gas or behind a
campaign button or beneath the
roar of a hundred thousand voices
raised together?

All i can hear is the pen scrib-
bling furiously. The elec-
troencephalogram is on. Subject:
the young American (middle class,
lettohthe-center elite). The
subject _ is sleeping deeply,
paradochal sleep. Probably
dreaming, beta waves recorded on
a steady flow of graph paper. The
ink spatters occasionally, the
paper sifts down silenuy.

Sometimes it‘s magical to get up
before you, in the dark, to slip out
of covers, into my robe and chair.
The lamp doesn’t wake you. You
sleep soundly, probably dreaming.
i can’t sleep, my mind is too full
tonight . this morning . l empty it

onto the white of my notebook,
All i can hear is your deep
breathing and the light scratching
of my pen. The flow of the ink is
peaceful and clean. The mist is
rising. there is blue in the sky now.

Recently, we witnessed the
dismissal of Saga. In a sudden
dictate from Nollen House, Saga
and the college community were
notified that a new food service had
been chosen for us. Some students
were of course elated; Saga has

long served as an emotional'

release for boarding Studenm. A
food service is one of the few things
on campus that can be criticized
without fear of reprisals or drawn
out intellectual arguments. Not
that some of the criticisms weren’t
well placed (or received), for
vigilance on the partrof the diners

has been essential in keeping“

standards from bottoming out.

Some were elated, yet a sure
prising number of students reacted
in a more reserved and cautious
manner. I was disturbed by the
manner in which the decision was
arrived at and released, rather
than being upset or inspired by
Saga’s sudden demise at Grinnell.

The whole question of the food
service and Saga in particular had
come under investigation earlier in
the semester. it was feared by
some that Saga had begun some
sort of dynasty at Grinnell, and
would eventually lead to an unr
competitive, miniature,
monopolistic system designed to
take large profits and deliver a
poor serVice.

Mr. Pomerenk, admini-
strative supervisor of the
food service, revealed that it had
been five or six years since he had
even requested alternative food
services to bid on Grinnell’s
contract. I found this to represent
considerable administrative
negligence on Pomerenk’s part,
and I was looking forward to
hearing that he had finally taken to
heart the idea that competition for
the food service contract was in the
best interests of the student
boarders.

Mr. Pomerenk’s and Mr.
Walker’s decision to terminate

Saga’s contract had shown mat,

lhey had taken something to heart,

although competition wasn’t
clearly involved, since as far as
they chose to reveal, only one
alternative was explored, and that
without formal bidding. It seems
obvious that a number of bids
would have been in order, if the
college was to hunt for an alter
native to Saga. Perhaps, in cone
trast to what Pomerenk contends,
a lower cost service was not the
primary goal. it not, then what
was? if it was Hie goal, then it
appears that Pomerenk is once
again quite negligent in his ad-
ministrative duties. Some ex-
planations are badly needed.

My second gripe is concerned
with the complete lack of student
involvement in the decision. Why
was there no attempt to involve the
students in the decision? It is again
quite obvious that the students are
the ones who stand to gain or lose
the most from the switch, which
was contemplated and finalized
behind closed doors. Do Pomerenk
and Walker really think that mey
have nothing to gain from student
input'! 1 hope that student input is
taken more seriously than this
action implies.

Thirdly, why was Saga notified
of the decision after it had been
finalized rather than during the

, negotiations with McConnell? Such
a torewarning 15_ only fair, it- not a ,

human courtesy owed the manager
and his staff. Who knows, maybe
Saga would have countered with an
alternative bid. At any rate, there
was nothing tolose, and everything
to gain (including the respect owed
Mr. Roberts and his staff).

The handling of this affair by Mr.
Pomerenk and Mr. Walker seems
almost too antithetical in nature to
my intuition of what a liberal arts
school stands for in the best sense.
And even then. it seems all too
typical to an intuition l have gained
for this administration's handling
of Grinnell's affairs. I am begin-
ning to recognize the validity of
this intuition as I see it in others.
Grinnell is supposed to sland for
open human interactions in
developing philosophies to direct
lives and societies. Yet some very
key decisions at Grinnell are
becoming less and less the result of
a process of human interactions
and more a matter of policy dic-
tationl'rom a very few people. This
is contradictory, if not
hypocritical.

Finally, it is up to the students
and faculty to keep a vigilance on
the administrators, and hold them
accountable for their deeds and
misdeeds. A food service dynasty
is a real joke compared to the
dynasty which has begun to reign
in Nollen House. , , ',
