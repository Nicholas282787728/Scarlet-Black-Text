Paying for other campus’ mistakes,

Students speak out
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words, and you’re
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at
alward@grinnell,edu.
After all, complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more run
than doing it alone.

I love Cledus’ﬁ Cledus proves that, no, chivalry is not
dead. It is rotting disgustingly and ﬂagrantly across
the Grinnell Campus. Even if you don't know Cledus
speciﬁcally you will know the type. The type of guy
who suggests masturbating themed study breaks and
likes to brag about ”fucking girls raw.” Ves, those fine
up-standing male students who can only think about
dry humping and boasts his BAC loudly and weekly
Now, I don't mean to insult any of those sensitive
males out there, or even those who don’t look at col-
lege as a boundless field of booze and pussy. But you
need more men who like to ﬁnger drunken girls on
Mac Field and than tell everyone about it. I know that
when Icame to Grinnell all I wanted to ﬁnd was the
perfect foul mouthed gentlemen who could talk to
me for long periods of times about incredibly fasci-

. noting things: like his penis.

To the enthusiastic percussionists of Loose 2nd:
your enthusiasm is killing us. We can understand the
appeal of, say, one or two hours of ceaseless banging
on the drums. Golly, sometimes you even play a really
tough rhythm and we're all impressed. But once you
extend your sessions past those first couple of hours
(recall the night you commenced at seven and closed
at midnight?), even your most tolerant listeners
would rather have peanut butter packed in their ears
than hear another clack from your cursed cowbell. So
here's to throwing in the towel on percussion, and
some strong encouragement to try your hands at air
guitars

There’s nothing worse man the feeling that people
less informed than you are dictating your actions.
Such is my feeling on Saturday nighu when I see a
Grinnell police car drive past one of our otfrcampus
gatherings. I notice the first years shrink, envision-
ing themselves behind bars and their parents ﬁnding
out Ready to join them in nearing the exit, the up»
perclassmen save me, and I’m reassured that it was
just a coincidence by the fact that they didn’t even
see the car, and in fact leapt from their lounging
positions to reﬁlltheir cups. Five minutes later, three
more cars randomly appear and the ﬂashing lights
disband the party wiﬂi threats of hand-cuffs and ID
checks. As I leave to go to another party, Iwonder,
am I this much less responsible than students several
years ago, or are we paying for other campus’ mis»
takes?
