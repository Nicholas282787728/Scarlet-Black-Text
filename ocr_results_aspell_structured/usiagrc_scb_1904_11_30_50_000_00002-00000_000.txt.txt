Editors SCARLET AND BLAL :

The writer was present a l'o‘v weehs
since at the chapel .lecture on “The
New Testament in the milking.”
The subyect wit treated that evening
alruost exclusively ircm the human
stdnllpolntiitlie natural process by
which the Xew Testament was made.

I attended tint the one lecture and
know tlrattlrc other side oi the sub~
iect may have been brought out at
sorrrc other time, but irorn listening
that‘ evening some questions arose
What was giien interesting
and lrelpiiii but ii it was the whole
truththere is little solid ground on
which we can stand. Lest others
may irave heard btit the one lecture
the writer would hire to bring out
the other side.

“it was the Whole truth What is
the diirererrce between the New Tes—
tament and the writings oi Josephus,
between the New Testament and the
writings oi Martin Luther, between
the New Testament and the writings
of Joseph Smith, the latter day Saint?
What is the difference between the
record or the council held in Jerusa-
lern to consider matters of the church,
as given in AcLs, and the secretary's
report of the council lrcld in Des
Memes?

Most of the New Testament was
written by inch who made three claims

was

for themselves.

1. That they had received a Divine
commission for their wor-lt.

2. That their work was mgive to
the world a special Divine revelation.

3. in that ivorlr they were to have
the guidance and help of the Holy
Spirit.

The prooi oi their claims was to be
the results ortheir worlr, and we be
lieve their claims have been establish
ed.

The NewTestarnenthas been con-
sidered authority hy the church down

’ through the ages, It has worlred for
ageneration in individual souls, and
translated into all languages does not
lose its power out is instrumental in
saving the world.

We believe no one since then has

made all three or these claims. Jose-
phus did not claim a Divine commis—
sion, he did not claim a Divine revcld»
tion and he did not claim the guidance
and help at the Holy Spirit.

His work has been or use but we be-
lieve it lrasjnever worhed l'cﬂeiiel'dtlon

in dSingle soul, not if translated inLO

Joseph Smith Claimed it Divine

did not clairir the guidance ortire Holy

‘tno councils is. that one ii .rs ordained

of God to belt p'tl‘b 01' the livid}: and

Many r-esiiltsoi recent research were

were letters WllLLen
church matters. 1
lecturer to say, they were just letters
written in regard to church meters,
and to close hls lecture with-“If you
and I feel impelled to {my work let
ris go tor-ward and God will help us.”

If this is tame the thousands OI let-
terswritten every year in regard to
church nratters would be a part oi the
Blble. We believo that new light will
yet break irorn the sacred pages and
We also believe that God will yet xeveitl
Himself more full)" to willing, obed-
ient hearts. “'1: do not know whether
another spct’lttl revelation will cvel’ be
given.

Je is quoted the O‘d Testrimcnb as
Divine authority. We do not know

but than if the keys of a new Heaven
and a new Earth should be revealed in
would be found that lol’ ages they had
been hidden between the covers of

the Book.

DR. STEINER IN MARSHALLTOWN

Last Sunday evening, the splendid
new building of the n. R. v. M. c. it.
oi Marshalltown was dedicated. The
services were held in the OdenTheatre
ivlrerc over a thousand people, taxing
the seating capacity and standing to
the greatest extent, listened to the
addressot the evening by Prof. E. A.
Steiner on the Value of a Man. Tire
inspiring suhiect was handled in a
masteriul and comprehensive way by
the I’l'oiersol', who perhaps itbovenear»
ly all others, is most capable oi treat/-
iirg this theme, Tracing man ironr
the beginning, and. placing him on the
highest pedestal or created beings. the
speaker in touching and powerful ﬂips
penis, pleaded ior the training and
development oi our modern youth.

His ideas carry wrth them so much
of the magnetism or the rrran. that
they strclr eternally in the conscious.
ness oi his hearers.

Marshalltown has prohted immeasur-
ably during the tirire oi his pr-oiessor-
shipirrcrinnell. He brings to them
on every occasion a new message,
clothed in its most iittirrg expressions
and delivered with the most lrcarotelt
sincerity.
