Germans Apathetic, but Not
Demoraiized, says Herman

Average Worker

Bul' Less Goods

“Don’t unit for Germany to crack
up internally because of the
privaiioiis ot wartime. or because
of any Allied bombings thus far."

This was the warning of stew-
art Herman, former member of
the American embassy staff in
Berlin. as he visited Grinnell
campus in a two»day lecture en-
gagement Wednesday and Thurs
day.

Speaking to history classes, in-
formal discussion groups and the
Jesse Macy public affairs club as
well as at Thursday chapel, Her-
inan gave the facts of present day
conditions in the Gel-man state as
well as those of foreigners and
prisoners as he had seen them
during six years of residence in
Berlin.

Herman was one of the Ameri-
cans residing in Berlin who werc
added to the embassy staff for
special service at the time the
European “or bi-okc out, Septem-
ber, lust, and the ntfairs of allied
helligerents were transferred to
the United States diplomatic of-
rice.

His work was mainly with rec
lief agencies for prisoners of war,
stranded nationals of warring
countries, and German citizens in
political disrcpute who wished to
leave that country for America.

Blackoul' Rules

Regulations for college participa—
tion in a stdte»wide blackout
scheduled for Dec. 14, were be
ing fol-med today by student or
ganizations and faculty committ-
ees along general lines suggested
by Dean Shelton L. Beatty this
week.

The blackout will last only 20
minutes, Beetty pointed out, but
the same precautions must be
taken as for a longer period or
for actual alrrx'ald conditionsi

Quadrangle hours will probably
be moved up to 9:30 p. m. for
that evening, Boatty said. Tele—
phone ond radio connections will
be maintained as they would in a

---for Dec. |4l

blackout. and any offices required
as well as the switch board room
will be equipped with blackout
curtains and shaded lights.

Practice in individual respon-
sibility during emergencies is ad-
vocated by Beatty, who recom-
mended that student wardens on
each floor extinguish all lights
rather than using a master
switch to put‘ the entire campus
into darkness.

“This enure situation is no
joke,” Beatty wrote to student
officers in issuing these recom-
mendations. ”The full cooperation
of every student is absolutely
necessary." '

Ambulance ls
Goal Sol By
War Chesl'

Hope To Raise $l 500
Allhough No Delinl’re
Plans Have Been Made

Funds to be raised by the
War Chest campaign were
delegated for the purchase of
an ambulance to be donated to
the Red Cl'OSS overseas Sela
vice when the committeee
headed by Robert H. Norton,
faculty chairman, opened its
year’s activities.

Cost would be approximately
31,500, Frank Burns, student
council representative on the
committee, reported.

No plans liltvc been made for
raising the money as yet. Each
cottage and hail will be asked
to coopcmte, presumably on the
house allocation plan used last
year, Burns said.

Organized last year, the War
Chest accumulated over $300 in
the second semester. This money
was allocated to local and nation-
al Red cross and other war
agencies. A residue of 520 has
been inherited by the present
committee.

First suggestion of the group
will be a “Sacrifice Week” be—
ginning Dcc. 1. during which per-
iod students will be asked to
give up cigarettes, cokcs and oth-
er luxury expenses and to donate
money ordinarily spent for them
to the War Chest, Burns said.

Rll'Lllcr plans will be drawn up
later.

Concert Band
To Play First

Program Dec. 6

The Crinnell college concert band
will perform for the first time
this year Sunday afternoon, De<
ccmber 6, in Herrick chapel, ac-
cording to conductor Kenneth D.
Simmons.

A varied program will be played
and will be highlighted by Paul
Fa-uchet's ”Symphony in B flat"
(Finale), Simmons said.

Eauchet, who was born in 1558,
composed the first symphony for
band. This symphony, to be
playcd Sunday, is little known
outside of France. It was first
performed by the Gnarde Repub-
licaine Band in France. and was
introduced into America by the
Carleton symphony band in a
concert at Grand Rapids. Mich
igan, in 1933.

The main theme of ti e Finale
is vigorous and inarclrlikc. Sim—
mons stated, while the secondary
theme is purely lyrical. The whole
symphony is clear out, leaving
the listener with a definite im-
pression, he said
The Red Cross classes are not
yet definitely scheduled, Miss
Margaret carey said last night.
