Retiring professors reminisce; philosophize

Guillermo
Mendoza

77 by Nancy Gould
Envision studerls of Grinnell
engaged in an all-campus mud
fight. According to Proiessor
Guillermo Mendoza, the sight was
common when he iirst began his
Grinnell teaching career 34 years
ago. Mendoza will be retiring at the
‘ténd oi this semester, and has much
to tell of his days at Grinnell since
1943.
Before teaching at Grinnell,
ail/tendon taught at Northwestern
University in Chicago. He moved
to Grinnell ”because then-
President Stevens asked me,” he
said. Mendoza met Stevens when
Stevens was the Dean of the
University College at Nor»
thwestem. When Stevens came to
Grinnell. he asked Mendoza to join
the faculty.
Although ”basically a zoologist,"
Mendoza has taught a variety of
biology courses since first coming
to Grinnell. For his entire 34 years
he has taught embryology. He
spent 27 years teaching genetics
* d five in comparative anatomy.
‘tie has also taught zoology and

mentioned that he usually becomes
involved with beginning courses of
some kind.

Mendoza doesn't feel that the
caliber of his biology students has
changed over the years. He said
that students now “have a superior
education before they get here,”
but stressed that their intellect is
not actually higher. He did,
‘ wever, feel that the students
\ re a bit more sophisticated
now," because the population of
the college is largely from big

' les.

According to Mendoza the
biggest change in the students, as
well as in the rest of the campus, is
increased liberalization. He
doesn’t ieel that the change is bad,
but noted that the campus has
indeed altered a great deal. During
the “indifferent 50‘s," students
were generally thought oi as being
apathetic. Mendoza ielt that these
students were concerned, but not

 

as apt to take any sort of action as
did the more radical studenB of the
“turbulent 60’s."

Socially, liberalization is cer-
tainly evident on the Grinnell
campus. When Mendoza first came
to Grinnell, World War II had
caused the absence of all but 15
male students on the campus.
During these days, according to
Mendoza, the women had “no
social distractions.” However.
upon the return of males to the
campus, the iemales immediately
changed H'leit‘ behavior, “As soon
as the men got back, they started
to dress up," said Mendoza.

Mendoza also recalls the social
changes that took place, or at least
the attempts students made to
bring about change during the 50’s.
“At one time there was an outroar
because a boy had stayed in Loose
Hall,” which was an allrfemale
dorm at that time. Mendoza added
that the attitudes oi today have
changed a great deal since those
days.

In addition to the all-campus
mud fights that occurred annually
during “Spring Days,” there were
other memorable events. Spring
Days gave students such enr
tertainment as ferris wheels and
badminton games. Mendoza also
recalls that water fights between
dorms were frequent.

Mendoza recalled a few of his
more amusing days at Grinnell. He
remembers one occasion when
students had packed the steps to
the post office with snow, to the
point where no one could enter, He
also has fond memories oi being
“drafted to wait tables in Quad."

The city of Grinnell also leaves
many memories with Mendoza, He
“deeply and sincerely likes
Grinnell,” and added that he has
made many “wonderful friend-
ships" here. During his earlier
days in Grinnell, Mendoza men»
tioned that he “devoted much
attention to the town." He was very
active in town affairs and said that
he has many iriends who are
townspeople.

When asked what he felt about
small private colleges in general,
he mentioned that he indeed has a
preference ior them. Mendoza also
said that he is “personally comr
mitted to the role of a liberal

education.” He feels that it is wiser
for a student to get a liberal arts
education than to specialize in 'a
specific area for a shorter time
period. Mendoza always urges his
pro-med students to continue for
four years in a liberal arts
education.

In honor of Mendoza’s
retirement, a symposium was held
last Saturday, Mendoza ielt that it
“went very well." and mentioned
that over 140 people attended. He
also added that many former
students and parents came from
all over the country to attend the
event . Faculty, students, friends.
and iamily were all present for the
symposium.

Looking towards the future,
Mendoza has some plans for his
retirement, He has been writing a
lab manual that he would like to
finish up. He also has some
research he would like to complete.
In addition to this, Mendoza will
spend the summer and possibly the
next few years teaching on a part
time basis at the University of
Texas in San Antonio. After a 34

 

year career at Grinnell, his plans
for the future remain flexible.

John
Kleinschmidt

by Caleb Sullivan
Perhaps you have noticed that at
approximately 6:45 every evening
a man and his dog take a walk
across South Campus. The man is
Professor John Kleinschmidt, the
dog, a beautiful french shurthair, is
Job de hautes Coutures (meaning,
Job, of a kennel in France).
Kleinschmidt has been teaching
in the French Department tor the
past twenty-nine years and will be
retiring at the end of this year.
A French major at Oberlin,
Kleinschmidt received his
Master’s at Brown University, and
then served as an officer in World
War II teaching artillery in Europe
and the United States. Later, he
received his doctorate in Geneva
and through connections with a
Grinnell professor, Harold Clapp,
Kleinschmidt came to Grinnell.
“Grinnell appeared to be a
congenial college and of a size I
could understand," he said,
Through his ymrs oi teaching,
Kleinschmidt has developed a style
uniquely his own: he rarely lec-
tures, grades are of minimal
importance, and class attendance
is not mandatory “Socratic ac-

‘ tivity,” explains Kleinschmidt, is

what he aims for in his classes.

‘1

His courses, however, are by no
means easy. “Students create their
own learning situation," he said.
“Education is the students’ en-
terprise . . . lam the resource.” in
his classes he attempts to stress
learning over grades by “making
testing a normal activity but not
something that controls an ac-
tivity." He acknowledges the fact
that some students are uneasy over
such a system, but adds that many
exstudenls make it a point to
compliment him later by saying,
“Now I know what you were
doing!”

His unique teaching style is not
all that makes Professor Klein-
Schmidt so fascinating. He has
constantly enveloped himseli in
projects and traveling to all points
on the globe.

He is interested in the works oi
Voltaire, spec cally those printed
during Voltaire's lifetime, as was
evident when he proudly displayed
his 250~year-old copy of a Voltaire
work, one of only two known to be
in existence. He is also interested
in the prinu'ng and bookselling
trade during the Enlightenment.

Kleinschmidt has yet to spend a
summer in Grinnell and only two
Christmases have gone by without
him and his wife going off to
Europe or some other corner of the
world. He also has a house in the
Canadian woods near the
Algonquin Provincial Park where
he can escape to when he feels he
needs “a change from the
relatively intense environment
here.”

Mr. Kleinschmidt is congenial
and easy to communicate with. He

has clear, concise opinions on any
one of number of subjects, Come
mentlng on liberal arts education
he said. “Liberal arts encourages
and provides the ability to be
irekireedom from things as well
as ideas; prejudice, bias, etc. What
I covet for you is a whole series of
literacies which will put you in a
position to havea way into the iield
of your choice.”

It will still be possible to see Mr.
Kleinschmldt and his dog at 6:45
every evening “perusing” South
Campus. Although Mr. Kleinr
Schmidt is retiring, he will' con-
tinue to be active. “1 may be a
lame duck. but I'm iar irom being
a dead duck! " he Said He plans to
stay in Grinnell and to pursue
various research projects, ”I have
bushels of things to work on,” he

explain, “articles, monographs,
leftovers from the last sabattical
. , I might even eke out a book,”

So the next time you see Mr.
Kleinschmidt and his dog, attempt
your pronunciation of “Job des
hautes Coutures” and say hello to
one oi the most uniqu and
respectedrmembers of Grinnell
College.
