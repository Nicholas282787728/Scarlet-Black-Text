GRINNELL OPINIONS UNIVERSAL

Grinllcll, known on many campuses for its
scholarship and athletics, has been receiving recog-
nition by colleges and uuiv sltics this year ill a
new ﬁcld, journalism. Editorial and news columns
of student publications on the exchange list of The
Griunell Scarlet and Black regularly reveal res
plints and excerpts from tllc Griuucll college ncwsr
P813 '

Editorial comment upon Tllc Scarlct and Black’s
efﬁcient editorial board appeared in the Coo college
Cosmos The Iowa Wesleyan News reprinted sever-
al editorials which were written by Scarlet alld
Black writers. Regular v‘ city scmiwecklv papers
have deemed the, "student thought” exp essed iu
the editorial columns of the Grrinllell newspaper
worthy of space.

The Student Life of: \Vashillgton university,
St. Louis member of the Missouri Valley confer-
ence, often reprints editorials and news stories
from The Scarlet and Black. Editorial opinions
on ”Cleaning the Smoking Rooms,” “Bull Sessions
Vs. Studying,” and “Deﬁnite Hours for Women”
have been reprinted by the Washington paper. A
feature on the recent initiation of the National
Collegiate Players here u‘as also taken from the
Grinncll newspaper by Student Life.

The College Eye, studcnt newspaper at Iowa
State Teachers college, Cedar Falls, reprinted a
Scarlet and Black editorial entitled “Iowa Teach-
ers Ask Cuts" in its ﬁrst edition after the Christ
mas holidays.

Experienced metropolitan editors are con-
vinced that the editorial page is doomed. The edir
torial writer is hired and must suppress his true
thoughts many timcs (at the order of the managing
editor. Surveys made of American college ncwsv
papers reveal that student editorials express mild
personal viewpoints, and not campus thought.

Considering the frequency of Scarlet and
Black editorials in the reprint columns of college
newspapers, the opinion expressed by Grimlcll
writers are not personal or solely Grinnell view-
points, but are beliefs prevalent on other campuses.

GRH‘IN'ELL’S BABY DEBUTS

Friday afternoon at 3 o’clock will see this
year’s debut of swimming. Grinncll’s youngest
sport. Only last year graduated Dewey. Laustrup,
and Sbnrnborg, among the ﬁrst who ever swam
for the Scarlet and Black. The ﬁrst new generation
will show its prowess day after tomorrow.

Coach Elton A. Itoscn has been driving the.
splashcl's .at a gallop. Tllcy swim more in a day
than they used to ill a week, and should be in
winning condition.

Creighton is the ﬁrst opponent on the 1931
schedule. The local swimmers are given the odds
for sending the Blucjays toward the valley cellar.
Grinnell students will want to sce it done.

EXAIVHNATIONS, A CHALLENGE!

Ill football and basketball games, ill fact in
all athletic contests, the right attitude of mind
half wins the battle. Most players, are cager to
match their wits against all opponent’s, to show
what they can do in action. It is seldom that one
ever sees the ludicrous spectacle of a, team com-
plaining bceausc they have to play, or because the
game lasts too long.

And yet that is just what many students are
doing right now about their academic work. The
approaching semester examinations are again
causing the regular, twice-yearly chorus of
groans, and for what reasons? From the comment
one hears, the complaints seem to be two-fold:
ﬁrst, that there are such things as semester tests,
(and. second, that thcy keep students at college
until perhaps the middle of the last Week of the
semester.

There are people who sincerely think scluestcr
exams are unwise, but as long as Grinuell has
these tests, they are the rules of the game. And,
instead of regarding exams as hardships, and be-

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

grudgiug the work which they undeniably cause,
why not regard. them as (a challenge and an oppor-
tunity? A challenge to the student to show himself
and his instructors what he has learned, and an
opportunity to organize and correlate a half-year’s
material.

Then, too, examinations offer a chance to make
up for mistakes. Sometimes the few hours of con-
«Tull-atoll study, and the two or thrcc hours of
actual writing tiluc, make a difference (if ollc whole
point ill the ﬁnal grade. Often it is largely a matter
of good or bad attitude which dctcrmincs whether
that point is gained or last.

GILBERT JOINS HOUSE OF MORGAN

Most college students take some pride in haw-
ing no illusions about how success comes to‘ people
nowadays, They know that splitting rails all day,
and doing sums on the back .of the coal shovel by
ﬁl-clight arc not the paths taken by the follows
that arrive today. Many of them are well aware
that the way to get places is to polish their ﬁnger
nails and marry the boss” daughter.

The most conspicuous “arrival" during the
last year was reported a few days ago: the acccpr
tancc of S. Parker Gilbert as a partner in the house
of Morgan at the age of 38. And the house of
Morgan is, as one professor remarked, ﬁnancial
llcavcn.

Gilbert was not. conspicuously wealthy. He
took his undergraduate work not at Princeton but
at New Jersey state, commonly known as Rutgers.
He took no ntcrcst in athletics or other extras
cul- llar activities, as he later took} little interest
in society. He studied hard. graduating at the head
of his class at Itutgo nd cum laudc from Harvard
Law.’ ‘

The young law grad so impressed those under
whom he worked. often remaining in his ofﬁce un-
till 2 or 3 o‘clock in the morning, that he became
a. istant Secretary of the United States treasury
when 27, thence Dawes plan ndlllillistratol', and
now Morgan partner.

Not every mall who works in his ofﬁce till the
wee small hours gets ahead. Gilbert must have kept
his eyes open and recognized the breaks wllcll they
came his way. But. this man was promoted prilua
ily as a luau who knew thc. busiu not as a ccn~
tact mail.

It is encouraging to note that the demand in
modern business for executives who can know a
tremendous amount in one head, and who are cap-
able of plenty of work. still makes big openings
for the quiet fellow with the goods.

ARE YOU DISCOURAGED‘?
(From the Businm Machines)

Remember this: When Abraham Lincoln was a
young man he ran for the legislature in Illinois, and
was badly swamped.

He next entered business, failed, and spent 17 years
of his life paying up the debts of a worthless partner.

He was in love with a beautiful young woman, to
whom he became engagedrtben she died.

Later he married a woman who was 5. constant.
burden to him.

He then tr-led to get an appointment to the United
states Land ofﬁce, but failed.

Entering politics again he ran for congress, and
was badly defeated.

He became a candidate {or the United States sen-
ate, and was badly defeated.

In 1865 be became a candidate for the vice-presi-
dency, and was again defeated.

In 1858 he was defeated by Douglas.

One failure after anotherihad failurcsigreat set—
backs. In the face of all this he eventually became one
of the country‘s greatest men, if not the greatest.

When you think of a series of setbacks like this,
doesn’t. it make you feel small to become discouraged
just because you think you are having a hard time in
life?

IF COACHES WERE PROFESSORS
(From the Boston Benmpot)

“Now listen, you bunch of dim-wits. 1 want you
to put some pep into the recitation this morning. Re-
member, you're not at any pink tea. You’ve been stalling
around enough this year, and I‘m tired of it, see7 Yeah,
I mean all of you, every cockreyed one.

”Billings, recite that piece of Brow-lung I told the
class to memorize. You can't do it, huh? I thought not,
you dumb appleiyou’ll never be anything but a bench-
warmer. Hey, you dizzy blonde on the front row can
you come out of the come and give it? All right—that’s
pretty fair. You’re snowing better form, Miss Blank.

“Well, Dutton, Wake up and tell me Where Browne
ing was born. Huh? Why, you moron, you half-wit, I've
a good mind to Send you to the showers! You didn't
study the lesson, huh, you lily-livered slacker? All
right. Miss Perry, what do you say? Why—it, no! That's
not the right answer. I never in all my life saw such
a shameless, dead—head bunch of phonies as the students
in this class. I’ll never in God’s world be able to drill
enough sense into your empty beans 50 that you’ll even
have a chance against the semester exams. Yeah, I
mean it, you pikers!"
