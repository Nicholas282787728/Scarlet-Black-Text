Babu from page 1

During his lectures, Bahu did indeed
espouse a philosophy or government
that maintains tight control yet allows
tor individual initiative

The term “developing countries.”
when used to reler to Third World coun-
tries in general, is a misnomer. Babu
said to a class on Thursday. “The Third
World leatures two types of economies.
developing and deteriorating."

in a developing country. there is a
balance between consumption and pro-
duction, Babu said, In the deteriorating
economy consumption tar outweighs
production. The excess consumption is
supported with loreign aid, he said.

Babu disagrees with the distinction
made between capitalist and socialist
Third World countires. “Peasants are
the same in each country .poor.” The
reason [or the poor situa ion in many
Third World countries is the focus oi
priorities by the governments and their
external locus. he said.

“There is no correlation between
{amino and drought," Babu said. "We
have always had droughts. our
ancestors dealt with them . i . without
the tremendous loss oi human life like
today."

Babu attributes the current food shor—
tages to poor governmental planning
and improper priorities. The peasant
crop production ior export food
markets was encouraged tirstioy Cole
onialism and then by the World Bank,
”It you ta Third World country) Want to
plant maize or wheat or rice. you get no
money for it because it is not export
oriented

“The Third World can learn a lot
lrom the United States 7 more thall
any other country. The U.S. economy is
internally oriented. 93 percent of its
economy is internally directed. it there
were to be a world crisis today. only the
U.S. and North Korea could survive."
Babu said All other countries would be

shut down due to the loss of trade

The only way for the internal
economy of a third World country to
develop is by developing the peasant.
he said. This has proven to be difficult
because the peasants tend to be
somewhat conservative.

The Tanzanian government attempr
ted to collectivise farming in the 1960s
with disastrous results. In the experi-
ment with ‘Uyamaa.” Nyerere became
overzealous and tried to lorce the
peasants into the collective iarms.
Bahu said,

Bahu cited the example or a larmer
who managed 120 acres prior to the col»
lectivization drive. He was labeled a
capitalist and lost his farm to other
Villagers. Where the farmer had pro-
duced a yield of 36 bags of maize per
acre. the villagers produced only 6 bags
per acre The villagers also iarmed one
ly 9 acres of the 120, Situations Similar
to this lead to the agricultural crisis.

Such movements to socialize the
country without a plan were ill»
Conceived, said Babu. “This is not
socialism. this is madness."

Babu sees the multi-party state. ver»
sus the single-party state which cur»
rently exists throughout Africa. as a
necessary step toward solving Airica's
problems, “The kind ol leaders that are
in power today have a vested interest in

965 Mon

Africa's underdevelopment. They have
a vested interest in the status quo." he
said.

The leadership of African countries is
dominated by men serving in monare
chical systems where the president
makes all at the decisions. Babu said
"There is no room {or criticism in the
system.”

when there is onerparty government
the only method of change mus far has
been militarily, Babu said, ttoau
(Organization of African Unity) sums
m its today are like meetings or the joint
chiefs of stat't . . , you have General this
and General that.

“You should not condone the one»
party state. You cannot have a best
president (Nyerere) on one hand and
starving people on the other. It's a con»
tradiction.” Babu said.

“There is corrthion in both a multis
party system and in a singlesparty
state.” he Said. “The ditlerence is that
in a multiparty state corruption can be
exposed through a tree press and open
dissent."

Williams from page 1

“We don’t agree with you about
N icaragua.... Guatemalaw‘. or
Paraguay." she said. “Don’t iorget we
live With Yugoslavia which is a hell of a
lot closer than Nicaragua. We don't
know why you get so hot under the col-
lar in the States.

“We're scared Stiff you might invade
Nicaragua, It would have the most col-
ossal repercussions on the ‘Red Seui'l‘.’
Our whole moral position with
Aighanistan would be gone it you in-
vade. Williams said. And it you don’t in-
vade we wish you would stop hasseiing
her so much."

Williams pointed out that American
protests regarding human rights viola-
tions are somewhat specious. The us,
stance arouses very little sympathy in
Europe she said. “If you want to look
for human rights'violations the Philip-
pines can beat Nicaragua every time,"
