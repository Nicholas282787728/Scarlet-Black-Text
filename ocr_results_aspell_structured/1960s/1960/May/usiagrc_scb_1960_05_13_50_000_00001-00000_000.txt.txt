by Bill Mcclung

When the drought saps the
moisture from the fertile wcs.
tern lands, the scorched grass,
he dazed and dying animals
and the stickehot nights lay de-
'eat and despair on the soul.
ian prays and hopes and
reams for rain rain to
make the soil live, rain to get
he animals moving about and
rain to revivify the soul.

But there's another kind of
drought. The drought that con.
nues on and on. The drought
of a hopeless maid submissive
to her plainness, the drought of
a dreaming Rainmaker who has
never made a drop of rain or
the drought of a man without
any dreams.

These are the dry spells of
human, individual defeat and
despair, and they continue on.
sometimes openly, sometimes in
iidiug, until someone sprinkle
the soft rain or kindness or
undertanding or love
dry heart.

There's a play about these
things, and it‘s being per
‘formed these days in the old
ARH Arena Theater. It's N,
Richard Nash's romantic com
edy, “The Rainmaker." The
play is all about some pal-ch»
ed land and dry souls . . .
-aud a quack Rainmaker who
brings, to his great surprise,
real rain.

ality" was advocated by Sen.
Waync Morse in the keynote ads
ess tor the Mock Political Col-i—
iVenLiOl‘l last Friday, May 6.
Emphasizing the mitjor part
l that the Luv. should play in
world affairs, Morse said that
the UN. should approve all
I agreements b e tw e an nations
and should establish total dis~
l armament p r o g r a m s which
I would be foolproof.

He said that “all conferences
between individual nations should
come under the iurisdiction of
‘lhe UN.“ According to him, “a
ipoiitical platform should be a
isolid contract with pledges to be
Viiulfilled."

l Morse advocated the principles
oi human values and morality
and hoped the Democratic plat-
“form would uphold them His
speech was highly partisan beiore
,the combined two-party conven-
itioii, but he dismissed this fact
‘and expressed his own views.

He said that to compromise
the principles of a liberal isssue
I is to destroy the goal for which
:- you are striving. “Never bend
the knee of liberalism and poli-
tical intellectualisrn at the altar
of political expendienoy," Morse
said.

According to him, “people are
the true wealth of this nation,
and you cannot sacrifice their
rights and welfare for political
reasons." He saw the entire legis-
lative turmoil as one needing
moral considerations and one
‘that ought to be freed from com-
plete political control.

He quoted Franklin Roosevelt

and reminded the audience that
they have a “rendezvous with
destiny." To Morse the issues of
the campaign must meet this
destiny and mirror the moral
Ivalues of society.
‘ He said that political partisan.
ship and unenlightened public
opinion put good government un-
der the thumb of the public and
cause the compromising of issues,
which alters the real principles
involved.

In keeping with his view on
‘the people as the greatest
wealth," Morse emphasized the
issues of human rights and wel»
fare. He took a closed fist stand
on the rights of first class citi-
zenship for all. He also stressed
protection of the economic
weak from the strong.

Morse predicted widespread
medical aid within five years.
He thought it necessary to "keep
ahead of Russia in brainpower"
and to set standards for educa—
tional facilities.
