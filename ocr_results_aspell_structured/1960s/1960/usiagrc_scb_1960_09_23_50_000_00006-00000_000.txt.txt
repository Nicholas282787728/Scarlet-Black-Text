F o r m e r U.N. Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge said Sept.

complaints about travel restric

earthly business do they have
expecting to be accepted as base

not done one thing to justify
our departing from the letter
of the law."

Kennedy addressed himself
to Khrushchev on the same

been suggested that your ob»

not work. . . .0ur program is
not one that will please you."

Statements such as these,
which will probably be re.
peated frequently in the next
few days, do not increase the
dignity of the international
meeting ground.

Khrushchev himself said, “We

likes and dislikes regar 'ng this
