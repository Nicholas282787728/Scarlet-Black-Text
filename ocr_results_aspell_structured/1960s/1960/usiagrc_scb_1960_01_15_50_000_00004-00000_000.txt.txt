One of the most vital probe
lelns'lhe Democrats tace in their
nomination proceedings is the
special considerations of the
southern vote. Civil rights will,
oi course, be mentioned, but
the farm situation in the South,
will also be an issue. Perhaps
one oi Gov. Lavelcss‘ tar-m pol.
icy ideas will appeal directiyl
to the southern farmer. A “vo-i
cational education program” to
providc new job opportunities
for small tarmers who must
leave their farms because of low
incomes might be cspecially at-
tractive to the many small.

This short visit showed the'

is oi utmost importance that sol

as having enough food to keep

To illustrate graphically tile
problem in India, the average
caloric intake is 1840 calories l

to 3000 per man per day in this |
country and we can be sure -
that there is a greater ex.
penditure of calories in physi-
cal labor per person in lndia
than in a mechanized country
as our own.

India. which is roughly com-
parable to this country in size.
has about 2.2 times as many
people. This means that even it
india produced as much as we
did, each Indian would eat hall
as well as the average Anic
can; unIorLunalely, howeve,
due to poor land and primitivei
tanning methods, it producest
considerably less.

Tlius, it the average Indian
were to eat as well as the
average American, (1) the ,
population would have to be
cut in half and (2) iarming
methods would have to equal 1
