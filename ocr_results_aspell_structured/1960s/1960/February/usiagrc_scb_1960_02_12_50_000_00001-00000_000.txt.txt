Student Council Allocaies Funds;
Siskel Questions KGRW Checks

The Student council voted
Wednesday night to allocate
a total of $2198 to the Scar-
let and Black, KdRW and
the student auditor for sec-
ond semester budgets.

The 5&3 received $1650.76.
KGRW’s requested budget of
$298.70 was approved after
lengthy discussion, and Walter
Frank, student auditor, was given
$243.75 for operating expenses.

Although the SM; budget
and the auditor's, budget were
approved with little discussion,
KGRW and its budget were
discussed for almost an hour,

Most of the questioning coll~
cerning the radio station came

‘ from Social coordinator Bill SlSv
kel. Siskel, in an apparent at»
rtempt to block the allocation,
brought to the attention of the

v

council vallous reasons and evi-
dence why KGRW should not
get the money for which it
asked.

Much of his argument was
based on a poll, which he him.
self admitted was not complete,
taken to determine how unity
students listen to KGRW. He
also questioned the validity of
various checks witten by the
station. However, Gene Shcpr
ard, station manager, proved in
the satisiaction oi the council
that the checks were valid.

The council voted, almost un-
:lnlmously, to give KGRW the
$293.

Almost $5,000 has been spent
on the radio station in the last
three years, and it was pointed
out that the capital improve-
ments are now complete.

Plagiarism Proceedings Reviewed

But Is There fA Better Solution?

by Nancy Page!
_' and
Doc Davenport

What happens when some-
body is accused of plagiar-
ism? Is further definition of
plagiarism needed? Is there
a better solution to the prob
lem of academic honesty
than mele definition?

The student handbook states

the following: “students are
guilty oi plagiarism when they
borrow the ideas and more
especially, the actual words of
others, and present them as
their own,”

But the enforcement of that
rule and the problems created
by academic dishonesty are
much more complex than a

'Social Gospel'

“The Social Gospel" was
discussed by Howard R.
Bul'kle, acting dean of the
chapel, this morning in Her-
rick chapel. His was the sec
0nd talk in the, series ”Dis-
tinctive American Faiths.“

Burkle said that the social
gospel is not an entirely new
phenomenon in America Rather,
it is a reappearance oi the
spiritual vitality that occurred
carhci in Alncrican history,
during the Glcat Awakening in
1730 and the se‘cond awakening
between 1795 and l815. At. these
times vitality was iiianltested ir'l
revivals.

The social gospel in its dlly
was “an attempt to cope with
a. drastically altered American
society," Burkle continued. Ur-
banization, bigsscale indust»
rialism, mass immigration and
corporate monopoly . are lac-
tors in the changing of son
ciety, ‘

In evaluating the social goss'
pel, Burkel said that the faith
was an answer to a demandl
[or an attitude "thoroughly till-
ed with a sense of ethical re
sponsibility and a concern for,
what happens to the dispossesc
ed and needy portions ct hu
manity in this life. The impetus}
in this direction continues but;
grows faint; the churches have
not yet begun to move to this
task. Unless they do the task
it will be done from some other

from this area and students.

A teacher and coach iii Mis-
souri for seven years before
entering the insurance iield in
Davenport in 1937, Schwengel
was elected to the Iowa legis-
laturc as Scott county repre-
sentative in 1944 and served
five consecutive terms before
his first election to Congress in
1954.

As a state legislator, sch.
wengel authored school and

works bills, In Congress he is
a member of the Public
Works oomnuttee oi the House
and has had an active part

Schwengel has often co'n-
demned America's creeping in-
nation problem. in July or 1955
he asked the members or Con-
gress not to be deluded into
the belief that “fistfuls‘ of dol-
lar bills spell an everlasting
lush prosperity for ‘our citi—
zens" and not to be fooled by
the “dazzling appearances of
the goddess of luck and easy
money."

The teaching profession re-

anti-inflation debates. I-le
equates better teachers with

Better teachers are avail-

said Schwengel.

Besides his congressional ac»
tivitics, Schwengel has worked
in promoting interest in govs
criiment and politics among stu—
dents. Schwengel originated and
now sponso , in cooperation
with the Ci Zenship Clearing
House at the University of
Iowa, the “Week in Washing-
ton" project. This program gives,
students an opportunity to
spend time in Washington as

Another unique project un-

are employed to do surveys
and backgrounrl study as a
basis for sfllrtlier legislative
proposiis. Five bills have
been introduced in Congress
as a result oi this teamwork.

An expert on Lincoln and the
history of the Civil War per-
iod, Schwengel will attend
Joseph Wall‘s American history
course at 10 Monday morning

 

and will also attend physics and

sociology classes.
