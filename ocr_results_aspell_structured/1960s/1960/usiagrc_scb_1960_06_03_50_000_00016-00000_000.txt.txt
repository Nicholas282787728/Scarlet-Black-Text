Fred Schwengel (Rep, 121.) who
explained the council's action.
A Race ltclntions committee
was also organized this spring
under council sponsorship to
learn about the "sit-in" move—

guide student activity aimed
at helping participants. ,
Two council repi-csentati‘vcs
were sent to the National Sltl<
dent conference on the sit—in
movement; they participated in
an cducational program ’eslgn-
cd for the student body as a
whole. As a result of this pro—
gram, the committee raised $478,
which has been sent to the
Committee on Racial Equality
and to students in the south.

sc president, the council offb

lcontinue their interest over the

summer by explaining the coun-
cil's actions in regard to the
loyalty .oath and the 'fsit-in”

lmovement to other college stu-

dentsn and interested persons,
and by writing letters to con-
gressmen. in addition, new ideas
