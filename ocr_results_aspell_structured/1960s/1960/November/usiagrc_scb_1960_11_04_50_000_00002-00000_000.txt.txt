This Tuesday ends a loner and arduous campaign for
both Ni oil and Kennedy, and more notably perhaps, 101
the advertising and public relations men, In Spite of, or
perhaps because of the nature ofthis particular campaign,
a lot of people wonder if they are any closer to an answer
than when the whole thing started.

the next President,

Because or s widely respect-

.Elscnhcwer has inevitably re
solved support for most at his
statements on defense. This is
not necessarily true with Vice-
President Nixon.

‘ Sch. Kennedy, du’l-lng the

cause oi the Eisenhower dciense
rcputation. At times he would

The Democrat has gradually
shiltcd the emphasis irom

program. Kennedy is now
probably gaining Suppm‘t on

become less idcntii'ied with
