Cleaver Says ‘American Religion"
(Closer To ReiSociaI Darwmlsm

I Charles G Cleaver (English)
Isaio this morning in a lecture
in chapel that the analogy be-
tween "Social and
sore “l‘ellglon ot the American
Iwa‘ closer today
Ithan it the l9tll cen-
ltury heyday or the theory,

Darwinism"

I Speaking in the series “Dis-
‘tnictlve ,Americnn Faiths," Clea-
‘\'er discussed “Social Darwin-
ism 11 American Faith?"

Cleaver defined Social Dar:
winis-m as the idea that hu—
man society is a scene or
struggle analogous to that oi
the jungle, He stated that
tram this comparison or hu—
l man and animal societies
i evolved the idea that the in-

dividual is lelt alone to

achieve his own ‘success.

in treating this philosophy as
an American religion, Cleaver
explained “the religion of the
American way." "Attention is
given to secular ideas that have
to do with the political and
try. Traditional religion is used
to serve these secular ends" or
economic system of the coun-
the get-ahead-expcnd spirit ot
the American way ot lite.

He then turned to the idea,
expressed by several contcln»
porary writers, that this spirit
of lndivldualisin and struggle
has died out entirely in our
corporate economy. Admitting
that this is true in certain in.
stances, Clcal'zer went on to
suggest that the “individual
Success ethic” is not really dead
but that it has changed forms.

l
i

, Since the 19th century, he
lsaid. Social Darwinism, as
, seen in Ameri 1, has Chang
I ed train the manipulation of
production to the manipula-
I tion or people. “The original
I Social Darwin sm theory as
I applied to the American way

0955 or the tittest, Today, the
emphasis is on security,
, durance and survival."
