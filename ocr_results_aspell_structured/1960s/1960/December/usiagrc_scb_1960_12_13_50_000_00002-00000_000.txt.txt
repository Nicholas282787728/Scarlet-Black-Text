COWLES MALL RETURNS
TO CofHP AUTHORITY
FOLLOWING BOAR‘S HEAD

On Monday evening the month—
long Cowles Rebellion ended. A
vote taken in housemeeting fav—
ored the return of the hall to
the authority of the CofHP. The

Was taken at the sugge tion
ie Rutherford, Cowles nall
who stated that con-
tinuance of the action was un—
ncccssary.

Rutherford added that the
original purpose of the rebell-
ion was to help in the incep—
tion of a Constitutional con—
Vention that would lead to more
student self—government. It is
his position that the activities
of part of the student body at
the Boar‘s Head dinner proved
the mass of students incapable
of governing themselves; and
that the need for rebellion
is no longer perti nt.

Discussion at the meeting
concerncd whether the number of
students should govern themselves.

There had been talk in the
hall of rejoining the CofHP when
a date for the Constitutional
convention was set; however, no
action was taken at that time.
