”The Religious Issue;
Where leadest It? l

pta good academic challenge in a.

by rat nubcr
. (political editor)

Nobody t ks about it, but‘
everybody will do something a—
bout it. The fact that the re»
ligi'ous question is not being
discussed constantly in the cam»
patgn, particularly not by the
candidates, Should-not suggest
that it has become an unimpor-
tant issue.

Fletcher Knebcl or the Cow-
le's publications said last Fri—
day that “in Grccnville county
(South Carolina) where 83
southern Baptist churches and
45.000 members provide ”in
densest concentration of Bap-
tists in the nation, the preachers
are almost unanimous against
Sen. John Kennedy because of
his Roman Catholic faith.”

Similar situations are con-
tinually reported from all
over the South. The import.
ance of the religious issue in
that area is ottcn over-eni-
phasizerl, however, because of
the outward form of anti-
Catholic sentiment in the
South.

This is not to say religion
is not an important issue in
the South, but rather it means
that it will be more dccisivc
in areas where the scales are
more evenly balanced between
the two parties.

The Midwest is a good ex-
ample. Although definitcly a
Republican area. the Democrats
have justifiable hopes of carry-
ing several inidwcstcrn state.
If they do not, the religious
issue will be one of the reasons.

In lowa, Kennedy is running
approximately 10 per cent be.
hind Nixon. while Democrat
Herschel Loveless leads his
Catholic senatorial opponent by
the same percentage. This dire
ferencc in the strength of the
two Democrats is due to various
factors, but it nevertheless sug-
be a deciding factor in the Midn
' wcst.

Suspicionot a Catholic Presi-
dent often centers around the
belief that the Roman Pontiff
will have a direct control upon
the executive actions of the
Pi dent. Howard R. Burkle
(phi csophy and religion) rctut.
ed this argument last January
in an article in the United
Church Herald.

Burkle said that the Roman
Catholic church does not be-
Lievu that “the supreme spiri~
(unlrhuthority is also a tem-
poral authority and possesses
a right to control the deel~
sions that civil rulers make as
civil rulers.

“or course, theory and piston
tice do not always match",
Burkle acknowledges. “Collu-l
sion between church and state
can occur; government can fall
victim to ecclesiastical mani-i
pulation. But surely this is not
a serious reason against votiilgl

 

for a Catholic in 20th century‘
America.”

Harold Fletcher (political.
science) said in a panel discuSA
sion of the subject in Herrick
chapel last year, that th cl

Anic an hierarchy of the Ca-l
thbllc church has made it \‘m‘y‘
clear that it does not believe]
in the separation of church and
state. 1

Burklc wrote that the Callie-l
lie church docs exert political;
influence through pressure
groups and other means, but so
do Protestant bodies. "Quakers
who abhor coercion and prcfcri
individual rather than organiz-
cd action Slill find it necessary,
as do the other maior Frotcs—j
tant bodies, to maintain a lobby
in Washington.

glans do distinguish between,

Burkle wrote that, “There
is no evidence that there is a
solid Catholic vote\or that
American Catholics are like-
ly to turn over the atialrs of
state to Vatican control orl
undue Vatican )lressure.” i

Fletcher said lllat after SUV-i

believe that the American Car

The frequently a cd question.l
do you think religion should be
an issue in the campaign, under.
scores a problem in the minds
of many religious people. The
question often suggests that
either one votes for or against
a man because of his particular
religion and is thus bigoted. ol'l
must say that religion is entire—
ly unrelated to politics.

Since the religious person
wants his vote to be 'p - ally
determined by his religious
convictions, he often thinks this
means he must vote for some-
one of the same religion. This
results from the failure to sep-
arate religious principles from
l'ellgious groups.

Sen. Kennedy said bluntly in
his speech accepting the nomi—i
nation. that if he were Pr :i-l
dent, his actions would be his
own and would not bl: influenc-
ed by his church.

When he later expressed his
dedication to moral and even
religious principles, he seem'cd
to be contradicting himself.
