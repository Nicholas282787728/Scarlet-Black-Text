Groups Want Peace, ' In tegrd tioni

by Thomas Knot!

\VﬂS active in tile programs ‘
which he discusses in the [ole i
lowing article. ’
"Trouble—trying to do some-
thing” reads a sign over the
desk of one Grinnell student.r’
This jest may be true of school
work, but it is not aimed at
that. It is an expression of ilisi
participation in two groups on
campus that have undertaken to
act on issues of social-imports
ance. .
These groups arc the Student
council Race Relations commit-
tce and a group of students con-
cerned w i t h pezlceiint’ul‘mally
called Grinncll Students fol"
Péace.

The first to term was the

i race group. Toward the mid~

die oi April, Jill Dennington
and Dick Mullins conceived
the idea ol organizing stu-
dents here in support oi the
Negroes struggle, tor equality.
They presented their telltar
tive plans to the Student coun-
cil, which suggested that a vote
be taken to see it the student
body favored such action.

By this time, nearly 40 stUr‘
dent's were active in the group,
which met one or two moons a
week to discuss ideas tor action,
and means of awakening the
concern’vnf more students. i
The committee was offered a‘
Friday chapel on April 22, at;
which time Gilbert Cranberg.

the group dis iibutcd a sheet tot

the history and method of the
sit-in technique of making one’s

The philosophy behind this

technique is quite simple: Non.
violence can overcome violence,
and faith can move not only
mountains but also oppressors.
When Cranberg spoke, the
chapel had about twice the usual
number of people in «it. They
heard him tell of the various
injustices and discriminations in
the South, while pointing out
that problems exist in the North,
too. He recommended that the
group establish close contacts
with southern schools and see
the problems of racial bias first
hand. ‘

Mullins and Ron Gault were
in Washington, 0.0., the day
oi Cranberg’s talk, where they
attended a special meeting or
the National Student associa-
tion to discuss the siHn move—
ment. They brought back in-
formation and ideas as to how
thc movement could be sup
ported and encouraged.
