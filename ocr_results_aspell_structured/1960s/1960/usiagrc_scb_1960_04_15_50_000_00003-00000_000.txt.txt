at the samc time, in the process
help develop an improved rela-

When temper starts

for an accident! Sure, the jerk who cuts you
all, or passes on the right, or rides your tail is maddening!
But when your temper takes over from your judgment, you
can do something foolish, or deadly! Last year, nearly 37,000
were killed on our roads-many by good drivers who simply
lost their heads. Don’t lose yourS#it could cost you your life!
