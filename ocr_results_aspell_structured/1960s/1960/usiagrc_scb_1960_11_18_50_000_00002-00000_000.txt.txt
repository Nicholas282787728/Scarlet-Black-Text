Part ill’ the pr ident's report released last month
,oiltlin a new approach toward foreign language instruc-
tion at Gri lell wllich President Howard K iowvn hopes
will be in I: but in four or I' yea

This section.'»\'hiell begins on page 52 al’ the report,
reads in part as follows.

“A major weakness of American education is that many
students still leave high school without having- made a sig-
.lill'lt'ﬂl'il. beginning in a foreign languag‘ Thus, many stil-
‘dents must start foreign language in college at the most
rudimentary level . . . Vet elementary language instruction
is not work ol’ college c librc and valuable time in college
‘should not be spent on it.

“We cannot practically orelcome this weakness im-
mediately, but it can be done progr ssn‘cly over a period
ol‘ years.

“I recommend that the college plan to discontinue
offering; 1 tr ear loreign language for credit and that
it plan pl‘og’rc'sively to more ' the foreign language re»
,anirement up to the point that ereiv graduate of Grinnell
‘Wili be able to r I, speak and wilte a foreign language
,with about tlle l'a lity that can now be attained in about
three and a half years of language study 2 the college
level. The Grinnell l'eilnirement‘in foreign language
should be met with not more than two years of study at
the college level." . ,

Dr, Bowen goes on in the‘ report to state that by Sep-
tember at 1963. the college should have as one 01' its ililr
mission requirements, tn ning‘ in a foreign language eiill
alent to one College year of study and that‘by 1966 this
requirement should be raised to the equivalent of one and
a half college years of study.

As the president states ill the report, this would mean
that by 1966 high school students entering,r Grilnlell would
have to have about three years of a foreign language to
qualify for college study. He also hopes to eliminate Inst—
year foreign languages for credit l'or all students after
September, 1963.

Few if any colleges in this country now have sue a
plan. It is without a doubt a “tough” change. Considering
that 50 percent of the high schools ill the United States
do not teach any foreign language, this will mean that
Grinnell will run the llsli of eliminating some 01' the applir
cunts who show the most potential just because they come
from all area where there is little or no language training.

However, it Grinnell is considering such a plan, then
other colleges may also consider and institute a similar
plan. This will put the pressure l’lfi'lti. where it belongsw
on the public schools, As Dr, Bowen sa , the public
schools will slowly realize, as they are beginning to real-
ize now, that their students will lint be admitted to the
better colleges unless they have the adequate training: in
foreign languages.
