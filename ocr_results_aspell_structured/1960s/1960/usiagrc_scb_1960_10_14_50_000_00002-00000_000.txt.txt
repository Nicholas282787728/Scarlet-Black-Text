Presiige

l’erhaps it 'is too early to comment on the candidates'
1' action to the Red China vote in the United Nations last'
week. Only one candidate, Sen. Kennedy, has made a di-
rect statement about the vote, while a vague statement has
ctr-me from Republican- national headquarters.

Speaking in Ohio. Kennedy said that the vote in the
UN. dismissing consideration of Chinese membership has
evidence of “sagging U.S. prestig‘ .” “I thillk the direction
must be reversed," said Kennedy in what appears to be an
indication tllat he believes by bringing more nations over
to ‘the side of America ill opposing the move, U.S. prestige
\iil rise.

l\lean\l'llilc, Republican headquarters released a state-
ment that Khrushchev Went home “elliptwllandcd and
with his tail hetiieen his legs” and that f. S. prestige

high because of these apparent defeats of collnnlinisln
In the U.N.

Neither candidate seems to be Willing to face the
facts concerning tile problem. This is disappointing but
nevertheless expected since it would take a lot of political
nerve to face the issue head on. Instead, each party grabs
at the issue as a chalice to prove its campaign slogan that
the llatiml is losing or keeping its prestige.

They have sidetracked the his issue e the fact that
admission of Red China to the U.N. is essential for any
kind of successful world lair, social progress, disarmament,
etc. — i favor of their petty pull a] football, prestig
Their refusal to think in positive terms about the problem
seems somewhat contradictory to their apparent worry over
loss of national prestige.

Supposedly, the United States is not opposed to seat-
ing China if “they change their ways." Why should the
Chinese change their ways? Is there any more of a chance
01' them changing their “way” isolated completely from
those forces which would, if anything- \i'0uld, change these
pays?

In a few years other nations ill the UN. will act for
themselves and will admit China. Then where will the Unit-
ed States he? Judging from prevalent attitudes today.
Americans will still be looking for their lost prestige and

wondering how they ever lost it.”Why we used to be the‘

leader,” they will say, “but thanks to the other party, we
lost our prestige, which is the most important thing . .
but if you vote For our party . , . . ”

The religious commitment is,

When Congress became a pee
lltlcal party, it retained Such an
identity with India and Gandhi
that opposition to it was con—
sidered unpatrioiic. With Cone
grcss further strengthened by
the great leadership of Jawar
harlal Nehru, India was, and to
a certain extent still is, a once
party democracy.

There are of course other
parties, and new ones are torn»
col periodically. However, these
must be considered mere splin—
ters from Congress and not ser—
ious divisions of its strength.
That the communists were the
first to break with Congress
has both helped and hurt them.

They split in 1942 before in»
dependence and worked with
the British during the war. This
cost them much popular sup
port but enabled them to de-
velop their orgunnticn at a
time when Congress ~s being
suppressed by the British,

Their greatest accomplishment
during this perlod was to
strengthen their hold on labor
unions. Even today they control
more unions than Congress (800
to 725) although Congress Collv
tl'ols more workers (900,000 to
535,000). This large number of
unions gives them much power
to cause agitation which they
utilizn at every possiblepccas
ion.

When independence was
achieved, the communists hop
on ror political chnos end a
resulting revolution. The over-
whelming popularity of Con-
gress and Nehru and Nehru-s
nhie leadership destroyed such
illusions,

The communist leaders saw
that it would be necessary to
achieve power by using such
“legal” methods as agitation of
riots and excessive criticism of
the government on all issues
and by winning positions at the
