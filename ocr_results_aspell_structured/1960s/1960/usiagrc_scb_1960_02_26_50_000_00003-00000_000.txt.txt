The Student council is the
polio making agcnt ot student
goi-c inient. it is thc body
where policy concerning the Slide
dents, strident organizations and
the administration should be
discussed and decided, This can
be achieved only by a ﬁrm and
workablc relationship between
the student body and thc faculty
and administration.

The prcscnt system is par
tentially a workable system or
student government which has
iaiii dormant. The iollowing

Instead or policy being il‘rllir

was the case in coed dining,
these issues would originate
with and he discussed by the
students, and policy would be
set b - the student- through
their student Counci since
the Central committee is made
up or the presidents of groups
involved, poli v may be cii'
cieiitly executed.

This step is mainly tor the
purpose oi creating student i'iii-

The next proposal is a stcpi
towards a more upriortlﬂtc sst
tom of handling scholastic dis-
lioiiest, At present the rule

publicized thoroughly enough
nor is it clear in the minds of
the students.
