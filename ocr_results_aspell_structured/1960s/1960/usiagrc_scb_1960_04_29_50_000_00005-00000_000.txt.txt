statements endorsed the sit—in

the movement, opposed all men-

inequality and condemned l‘ev

ugnized the importance of
broad action not only in the
south but also on campuses
and in local communities all
over the nation.

The 16 action proposals are
aimed at implementing the gen-
eral statements and furthering the
present methods of action, such
as petitions, letters, demonstra-
tions and boycotts, summer
meetings and workshops, confers
ences, exchanges between
schools, etc, If these recom-

Certainly as important, it not
more so, than what came from
the ofﬁcial session of the cons
ferciice were the contacts and
impressions formed and made
among the delegates in inf0r~
mat meetings. The dedication
and determination of the stu-
dent leaders of the Sildns was
very impressive and shook the
dozing consciences of the nor-

students are pledged to the
techniques of non-violent resis-
tance and peaceful negotiationsi
and solutions of the disoriinina-‘
tion problems in the south.

They realize that diiierent
parts of the south have dire

that the local groups must do»
