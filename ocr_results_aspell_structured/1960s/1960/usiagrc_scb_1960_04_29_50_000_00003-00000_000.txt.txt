Bergman Film
Allows Viewer i
Parlicipalion

by John Benson

Because or the recent success
of "The Magician," the Strand
has rushed to book anothcr lilm
by the Swedish writer and dir»
cctor liigmar Bergman as soon
as possible. The tihn, “Wild
Strawber es” is, I am happy tog
report. not only better than “The
Magician" but also much easier}
to under-stand. l

Much of Bergman’s other work,

often has a lack of intensity the
viewer may feel comparatively‘

little involvement in the stat . ‘

Although this element is present
in “Wild Strmvberrlcs” to a ce
tam extent, it is rar less evident
than in either “The Seventh Seal"
or "The Magician” because the
characters iiere are fully devclﬂ
oped and are not Just symbols,
The contemporary setting is pc
haps 'an advantage.

Symbolism is il omnipres-
ent, however, and extremely cr-
icctivc, irom the opening dream i
sequence. in which the doctor ‘
witnesses a tuneral and then
iinds that he is in the cottin,
to the close of the film. The
obscurity so prevclant in “The
Magi an" is almost completely
absent in “Wild strawberries."

The film follows a doctor, in
and-out ol' daydreams, through
the day on which he receives spe-
cial honors for 50 years of serv»
ice to medicine. In the course of
the day he comes to the realizes}

tron that he has not really lived it

life because he has isolated him-‘

rounding him

Most of these actors and act-
resses work with Bergman in,
what Sweden considers his main;
job, playwright, producer and
manager ot a large theater, and
their work with him in iilms in

cred a labor of love,

Although Bergman perhaps has
a tendency to be overrated as the
film wonder of the age. “Wild
