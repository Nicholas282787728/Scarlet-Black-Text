‘want you to know I’m with youI

i became GUESTS of your com-

Thc fire which deeroyed one of the old empty liar-I

racks Tuesday night provoked all “editorial” aired orel'

radio station KGRN Wednesday.

The person responsible for the vicious [act less attack
on Gliiiliell students was “Flosty” r itcllell, ounel' of the
statioll.

Mitchell, disr'egaidino all practices of ethical and 1e-
sponsible journalism, allowed a part of some news broad-
casts dul'illg‘ the day to be deleted to the cditoliol.

Admitting that the Grinnell fire chief said the cause
of the blaze was undetermined, the editorial went on to
accuse Gl'innell college students, point blank, of setting
the file. No proof of any kind was presented to support
this opinion,

. Mitchell called the college students ”vandals, adolescent
college kids, rude, obnoxious" and “a liability rather than
an asset to tile Grinnell community”—all of this because
student spectators kiddiiig'ly booed at the firemen when
they tried to save the already partly demolished 'empty
building.

The climax of the attack and accusation was a com-
ment that the iil'e demonstrated the truth in the saying
“there is danger in education." We do not follow this argu-
ment.

Rather, we would say that the selisationrseeking con-
duct of Mitchell showed the dangers of entrusting com-

munity responsibility to persons who are evidently not,

capable of executing that responsibility.

Having; met and worked with other citizens of Gl‘ll‘l‘
nell,\1e know that there are people in the toiin who are
concerned with and dedicated to the implovement of the
community.

Therefore, 011 behalf of the students of Gl'ilillell col<
leg'e we, submit this editorial to radio station KGRN, the
Gl'iliiiell Chamber of Commerce, the Grinllell city colliicil
and the Federal Communications commi sioll as a protest
arrainst the il'lesponsible, ulljusti”ed ﬂaws and slander-
ous attack upon the students 01' Gl'iiineli by a supposedly
commiln ,rlninded ioul'nalist.
