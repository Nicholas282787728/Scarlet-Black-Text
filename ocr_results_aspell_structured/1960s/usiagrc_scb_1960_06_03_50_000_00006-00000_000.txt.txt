The Scarlet and Black told us recently to take “The
Necessary Gamble,” nuclei the perhaps coll'e’ct assumption
that there is not a suflicient international tlust or a suf-
ficient intelnational body to make the necessary move to

'1111'd disarmament something besides ” the biggest

We do not suggest a vague, romantic solution for
these problems. There is: however, sometllinO' that can help,
in (lealing' with the situations mentioned above. This “some
thing” is an increased U.S. emphasis on the UN.

More international negotiations should be conducted
lndér the auspices ol’ the UN, although not necessarl v
within the U.N. proper. The U.S. should change, at \least
slightly, its attitude in the Security Council and General
Assembly in order to nake these bodies something more
than a propaganda 111a form.
