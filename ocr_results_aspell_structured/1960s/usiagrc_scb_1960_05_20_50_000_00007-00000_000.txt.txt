The Midwest conferencc tennis
champions ips, with singles
.matchcs beginning at a this
morning, are in full swing on
the Grinncll campus Singles
finals were to begin at a this
afternoon, weather permitting.

l Scheduled for tomorrow are
lthe doubles, again beginning at
a in the morning and continu-
ing to the finals, which will
probably begin sometime around
g vor before 3.

The whole meet is depend-
ent on the weather man, and
if he decides to dump a rain
storm on the campus at the
wrong time, things will have
to be moved indoors and, with
only the single court, slowed
down a good deal. ‘
