a few random facts from the

fit in any story.

Pioneer basketball fans for
the 20 points he popped
through the not when the
Viking eager-s visited here
earlier in the season.

Gray, who won't be eligible
for competition until a year
from now, made the switch with
no urging from any Grinneu
coach. A good friend of Jim
Lowry and Jim Simmons, he had
apparently considered Grinneil
quite thoughtfully before enroll~

school became unsatisfactory to
him. he made the switch.

Possessston of Dilly was to be

Pioneer tankers have usually
managed to outclass their op~
ponents by rather wide‘ margins
this year but will be faced with
a somewhat different task to
marrow, that of staying even
wrth their competition.
