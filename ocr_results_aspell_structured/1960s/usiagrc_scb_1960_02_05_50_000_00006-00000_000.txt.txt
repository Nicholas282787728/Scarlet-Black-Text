SC Considers _
Milk Machines

Carl Orr or Lang-s dairy said
yesterday that the dairy wuuld

do what it could to establish anl

acceptable proposal ior placing
milk machines on campus.

Orr said that Merritt C.
Ludwig, Vice—President ior Ad
ministration, had recently ask-
ed him tor a tentative pr
posal for placing and operat—
ing milk machines on campus.
Orr said they cannot present
such a proposal immediately,
but will do so soon.

Student Council president Steve
Faunre told the Student Council
Wednesday evening that Ludwig
had suggested that some of the
Coke dispensers be i'eplacedwith
milk machines. There can be
no increase in the total number
of vending machines, according
to college policy.

The dairy had told Ludwig
it would supply the milk and
dispensers at an extremely
low price. However, Ludwig
said in an interview Thurs-
day morning that it had been
one and a hall ycars since the
dairy had made the past nl‘ier.
Orr said thatisince then the
cost oi wholesale milk has
gone up substantially
This discussion or
chines is primarily concerned
wrth north campus although
Ludwig, Orr, and also the sc
believe that south campus could
also have thcm. Orr said the
dispensers on south campus
could contain nonfat milk as
well as whole mills and pci
haps orange drink
