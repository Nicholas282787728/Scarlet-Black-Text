As is always the case in this}
part or the country around tliisl
time of the year, the rains came
and went away; and with them
also went the 1M softball scheda
i'ile.

age of time left in the year
forced the discontinuing of the
regular softball schedule and

the initiation at a single elim-
ination tournament.
