chairman was to set aside two
hours on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday dur-
ing which time there would be
no prepping,

Later they also discontinued
the “fire drill" because they
thought it endangered the lives
of thc preps. This was an ex-
ercise which required the fresh-
men to run up and down the
fire escapes at full speed be.
tween rows of swinging pada
dles.

1n 1929 President Main Ls-
sued his famous letter declar—
ing that he had made up his
mind that prepping was fool.
ish and out of character with
the ideals of Grinnell college.
He “urged the ‘renunciation of
prepping’ in any and all of
its forms,"

After a year of haggling be.
tween the “constructive" and
“destructive" prepping campus,
the student body decided to lime
it prepping to three days in the
fall with a hell week in the
spring. Paddling was “minimize
ed." destruction was limited to
the campus and the preps were,
formally initiated. into the hall
at dinners.

other new program, this onel

had provisions for enforcement!

“inspire” the freshmen with the‘
“Grinnell spirit," not to (Brutal

retained, Prep capsia money,

in those days—were sold as
usual. and freshmen were to
consider it a priviedge to wear‘
them.

The penalties for not wearing
the caps, as for infraction of
other rules, were: 1st offense,i
a warning; 2nd offense, loss of
social privledges; 3rd offense,
expulsion from the hall, 4th of.
fense, expulsion from school.

made this statement about prep.

ended the era of “Constructive
Prepping," but it was followed
in quick succession by “The Hu-
manitarian Movement," 1940;
“The Rand Reform Restitution
Week," 1941, and, finally, the
“Grinnellianization Plan” in
1942.

This program was .set up on
an elaborate point system for
the entire class, and when the
class had 1000 points they were
permitted to abandon the prep.

Points were awarded for
fulfilling various requirements
_15 points when every fresh.
man had feared the school

were getting too bold, hall life

enthusiasm and spirit were gone.
Thus, in a zslelss vote, pad—

From that year, 1945-47, un-
til the spring of 1959, prepping
was to be a prominent activity
on the Grinnell campus. This
did not mean, however, that thel
prepping periods ran withoutl
restrictions.

in fact, only two programs inl
those 13 years were enacted
without modification and revi-
sion from the year before. A1-
so, contrary to popular opinion,
these were not the most harsh
programs ever enacted on thei
and few of
them appeared to be as bad as
those of the era before 1940,

Most of the programs during
those years theoretically start-
ed the second week after school
began. They included menial
duties, Stunts and constructive
activities scveral times during
the period, limited swats at
house meetings and plans en.
couraging preps to attend cula
