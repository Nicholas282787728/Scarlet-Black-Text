cit was too great to overcome.
and they had to settle for fourth
place in the stangiilgs,.During the
year Rawson was the only other
:louble winner, notching victories
. in volleyball . and swimming.
Dibble won the golf title; South.
bowling; and Clark tied with
Cowles in tennis to round up the
remainder of the ind‘ividuah sport
leaders. _

This year's intramural activi»
ties resulted in seven different
halls gaining titles in one or
more of the e sports. indica-
tive of the fact that talents
were widely dispersed is the
fact that only mo polnu separ-
ated the top four teams in the
trophy competition. ‘

Hoiilever,’following the four
leaders thé’re was a ZSO-pomt-
break to the fifth spot and an adv
ditional 190 points between fifth
and sixth. '

Playing conditions were some-
what different this year. The
construction of Norris hall de—
prived us of our beloved Cowlcs
football field, and the touch
football games in the fall were
played in left field of the var:
sily baseball diamond.

Unfortunately, ' there was a
gradual slope on the field run—
ning from east to west so thel
team running that way was CQn-l
stantly staging an uphill battle
regardless of the score. in addi-
tion, our kind weatherman al-
ways arranged windy, coldl
weather for the games, but this
kind of treatment can always be
expected in our great state of
corn.

we returned to normal condi-
tions until spring arrived, and we;
stumbled on to our newly sur~'|
faced softball diamond. In antici—~l

pation of touch iéotball next year,!
a new field was constructed;
directly 'north of Norris, and the
iM softball players were forced
to bear .the b nt of the transi
- tion difficulties , .

The top layer of ‘soil was re—,
moved from Mlle-0k} softball '
diamond for leveling purooses,
and the result was practically
a; mountainous infield, All of

touted for a first division berth
after a runner-up Imish the
year before, ran into a crazy
schcdule and a lack of enough
experienced ball players and
wound up with an BrlO confer
ence record, for an eighth place
lfinish and a 9713 overall won»
lost figure.

They were also handicapped
by the fact that there were
only four returning lettermen,
and the sophomores, with the
exception of Bob ltlusser, did
not develop as fast as was
hoped.

, Analyzing the season. Coach

John Pfitsch, said, “Our year
started badly because of the
rugged travel schedule and ﬁlls
juries to captain Bill Mechir
toek, Norm Sonju, Ray Horton
and Jim Simmons. 1 also mis—
iudgcd our personnel by having
them play a running game at
,first. starting with the Coe
game before semesters, we slow—
ed down, and this improved
both our offense and defense."

Faced with a schedule pro—
viding for two home games,
then 13 consecutive road games
before coming home to close out
the season with seven straight
contests, the pioneers stumbled
at first. with the pressure of
travel weighing heavily on them.
it was mid-season before they
were able .to get back to the
right track.

starters for the Pioneers
.throughout most or the year
were Simmons and Jim Law-
ry at forwards McClintock at
center and Musser and Jon
Groteluschen at guards. Bill
Parsons was a valuable num—
ber six man. iteser‘ves were

 

used extensively, however, and .

started many games as a unit
in place of the first five.
Musser was the only man
honored by the all»conference
selectors. The sharpshooting
sophomore was accorded a spot
on the second team, He scored
336 points for an average bf

in Conference

l Grinncll's runners, after tak-
‘ing a sixth in the conference
indoor, had a fine spring out—
door season and moved up a
notch to fifth place in the con.
ference outdoor.
The indoor season was not
a particularly outstanding one
since the Pioneers participat-
ed in only three meets and did
not distinguish themselves in
any of them.

Ernie Rutherford and John

Pioneers in the pole vault and

medal although he had vaulted

During the outdoor Season

Griilnell experienced early dif-l

ficulties as the men who join-
ed the team from the winter
sports squads tried to get them-
selves in shape. Once the squad
was at full strength things be—
gan to look up, and records
started to fall.

Walt Neevcl developed ‘info

mark with a 483 clocking in

finale.

Rutherford also was an cub

the season. After his pole vault
victory indoors, he continued
to improve until the end of the
year when ,he did 13'2" for a

If the performances of Grin-
nell's freshman athletes arc any
indication, the next three years
should be fruitful ones for Pion-
eer athletic teams.

All the teams were strong, and,
though all of them did not have
an opportunity to compete in a
conference meet, two which did
easily won against their Midwest
competition. Swimming
was the first sport where a
crown was won. The first year
tankers set four records on their
way to victory.

The fresh track learl‘l. which
was especially slrong in the field
levents, trounced all their rivals
and eased home winners by 30
points in their telegraphic confer--
lance meet.

The tennis and baseball Squads
were also ranked, along with the
lwo mentioned above, as the
finest to enter this school in many
years. The football, croRSrcotmtry,
and golf teams were all blessed
‘witii many talented performers
and fared well in every test they
faced. Four of these sduads were
hampered hit the usual freshman
dilemma of lack of an extensive
schedule or season—ending con-
lIErenCE meet.

The wrestling and basketball
teams were not so fortunate in
their records as the o~bcr Grin.

guished themselves on occasion
and several individuals showed

the potential that may take them .
