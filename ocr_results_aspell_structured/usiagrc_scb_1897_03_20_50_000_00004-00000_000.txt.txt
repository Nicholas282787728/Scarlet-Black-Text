The Proposed Honor System.

students who are opposed to this
plan. Of course no plan is worth
much that does not meet some
opposition. But to stigmatizc as
unworthy the repugnance of many
studcnts is nonraplopos. It is but
fair to state that this plan origi-
nates from a certain few who do
not represent all classes among
our students.

Ofthe plan itself, a \vorbl. As
proposed it will be applied only
to examinations and written rer
Views. In other words one may
“frog” all tlle year ulltil examiner
tion week. If we are to have the
plan at all and be consistent, it
would seem that it must be carr
rled into tlle daily recitations as
well, and heie we reach delicate
ground, whele can the proper line
be drawn? We will all be danr
gerollsly near the transition line
it every case of infraction is re
ported. Yet if the plan is worth
introducing at all, it must be ape
pliedin detail. In other words,
it it is absolutely right to adopt
this plan for our examinations,
the same reasoning would intro
ducc it further.

Again, it this system is adopted
by a majority vote in mass meet-
ing, it does not appear that any
obligation can be forced upon one
who has opposed the plan to
“peach,” We are under moral
obligations to conceal no offence
against civil law, but the condi-
tions are different, and it would
seem no argument from analogy
can be drawn. Unless every one

 

coropcratcs, success can not be
complete, Yet it is doubtless
true that any stutlcnt who believes
there is a better way than tllc plan
proposed has a light to retusc his
support.

The whole scheme appears to
be Fitting a second suit of clothes
upon our institution;\vhal is the
bestplan (if such bothc case) else
where, is not necessarily so here.
The conditions are diﬂcrent. Yet
throwing all this argument aside,
why is it necessary to saddle upon
ourselves this mechanical system?
Wily cannot tlle sentiment he cre
ated without it? Are we .mere
babies in stvaddlllig clothes, to be
trtlndled about by rules and regur
lations? Those who are hole for
higher living do 110! ”mi mt; [II/1’-

The annual bowl ﬁght between
the sophomores and treshrnen at
the University of Pennsylvania
will take place soon. The object
of the freshmen in this contest is
to take the bowl from the sopho-
mores and break it, while the
sophomores endeavor to place the
freshman bowl man in the bowl.
The bowl itself is made of pieced
wood. is decorated with the em-
blems and colors of the various
fraternities, and is preserved until
the seniorycar when it is given to
the second most popular man of
the class.
