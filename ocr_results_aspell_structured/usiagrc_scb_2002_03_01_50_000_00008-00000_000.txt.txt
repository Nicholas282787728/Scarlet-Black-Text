Men’s tennis drops two

Coe College's lop regional player Nick Barnes tops Felipe Bautista ’02 6-4, 6-4

Staff Writer

After a runarlable start, Grinnell men's tennis was brought down from
Lhc clouds in back-[whack losses last Saturday, Feb. 13. Grinncll, now 3-
2 and united 19th in die area entering today's marehnp wirh rhe Univerv
sity ofWisconsin-Oshltoah, has struck :1 balance between reﬂection and
optimism.

“We went To Cot» with the idea Thar our

marches would provide a nice barometer reading “From the lawns against UW’
LaCrosse, there is no doubt
that we have a good team
which can play well against
some of the mid—range ranked
teams in the Midwest Re—

os ro where we are compctlrlvcly,” eoaeh Andy
Hamilron said.

“From rho resulis against UW.LaCrosse,
rhere is no doubt rhar we have a good ream
which ear. play well agaiiisr some or ihe mid
range ranked reams in rhe Midwesr Region," he
said. “Based on our resiilr againsr Coo, however,
ir is clear we have a way ro go before we can
compere ar the NCAArDivislon 111 national
level,"

in Grinnells ﬁrsr rhree meets, the ream won
20 of a possible 21 sets, opening with a 6-1
dominarion orwesrminsrer on Feb 9 and a pair
or 7.0 whirewashes against Maeslesrer and Cornell Colleges a week
later,

On Sarurday, however. Grinnell losr rough conresrs againsr Lacrosse
and Coe, 5‘2 and 7.0. respecrively. Grinnell's doubles reams, undeieared
enrering rhe game, wenr a clean 0-6. The only rwo singles victories for
Grinnell were 1=elipe bauiisra's '02 6A3, 64 Victory over Lacrosse's Brim
Hornburg, and Ashiag Rahman's '02 74, LG, 6-1 vicrory over Nader
Khreish,

gion.”

— Head coach Andy Hamilton

Againsr coe, however, even aaurisra and Rahman couldii'r hold
back the powerful Kohawks. Baurisra fell 64, 6.4 to Nick Barnes, one
of rhe top players in the area, in one oirhe mosr anricipared one.oii.
onecomesrs oirlieyoung season, Rahman, meanwhile, bowed to Code
Phil Williams 5.1, 62. No Pioneer managed more than three games
in any singles mareh.

Still, rhe ream remains upbeai aboiir
ioday’s nieeriiig wirh Oshkosh.

“The oslikosh march will be another great
mist for us because rheir sound is quire similar to
La Crosses," Hamilron said. “1 rhink rhe experie
eiice lasr week showed me members oi‘rhe ream
rliar we can be very erinipennve with a ream like
Oshkosh, and 1 look {or us ro play much boner
on Friday,"

The road doesni gcr any easier, bur ihe l>ioe
nsers have already (iced some ol rho area's besr.
Oshkosh, which went to rho Nciw\.l)wisioii
111 toninamenr lasr year, is ranked lorh in the
area. last week's opponents nk yusr as high.
Lacrosse is 11th, and coe, tourrli, is also eiire
renrly No. 14 in she narion u rhe Division 111
level.

Moroever, Hamilron's custom is to schedule conresrs against “342
regionally ranked or scltolnrshlprgmnnng schools," so she Pioneers will
see plenty more eonrenders :15 they try once again ro oipinre rheir nrsr
conference riile since 1962

But even after rhe season’s ﬁrsr defeats, the Pioneers feel rhey are a
legitimate eonrender roe. one rhing is ior sure: they havcn'r losr rheir
oprimism.
