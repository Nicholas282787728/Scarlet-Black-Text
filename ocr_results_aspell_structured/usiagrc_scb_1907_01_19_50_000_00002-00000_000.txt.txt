Some misapprehension may have
been caused by the statements made
last week Lllat originators of good
ideas in regard to the semester fee
matter would be given publicacknowl-
edgemeiir. Although all cannot be
given individual recognition by other
means than through the Scarlet $7
Black columns, it is not the purpose
to publish names except with permis-
sion and then only when practically
the whole argument or suggestion is
given Verbatim. Do not fear therefore
thatby making use of an “Opinion
card" you get your name before the
public unwillingly. We want as many
answers to the question as possible,
and though to many, the only reward
will be the consciousness that you
have done your duty and said your
say, as far as possible we will endeavor
to get the permission of individual to
give them and their id eas public
recognition. Get an "Opinion Card,”
either in the president’s oiﬁce or the
Association building, then get an
Opinion and. along with it the pride
and conﬁdencein it which will lead
you to put it down in black and white
Where it can be seen and proﬁted by.

The revived activity of the gir
athletic association suggests the idea
that perhaps there may be another
basketball series this year.

There will doubtless be some games
played whether the regular system is
followedor not, IIeretoiorethecuslom
has been to have these games played
for the beneﬁt or the girls only, no
men being allowed among tiie spect-
ators, except ior one game. The fact
that men were allowed for that game,
that men were permitted to assist, in
the coaching and that on exhibition
days men were permitted to wine,
disproves any statement to the eirect.
that their presence is objectionable
Also, where the audience was aselectr
ed one. no admission could becharged.
Now the men’s series of class basket
ballgames is something or a money.
maker for the men‘s athletic union.
Since the girls have a similar associ»
anion, why shouldn't they be allowed
Wﬁnance it with money earned in
the same way? There are few ways
this they can, so ifihere is such a
thing year as a girls' class basket ball
series We Vote to have it open to the
public who will gladly pay a reason-
able admission fee to encourage the
girls in the good work they are trying
to do, both on the basket ball couro
and in the way of putting girls’ athle-
tics in Iowa. College on a. sound basis.

 

SCARLET AND BLACK

WHAT THE OPINIONS ARE.

General Trend in Favor Ola Semtslcr
Freon-A Few Good Argumcms
Con.

In general the opinions expressed
thus far are in favor oiulie new idea
regarding aseniesrer iee to coyei- ilie
expenses oieollene social and aililetic
events. Tile ai-giirneuisin iavor are
as a rule those which have already
been advanced. A few good sugges-
tions against the plan have been re-
ceived.

A well our 'edoutargumentagainst
is the following by Glenn Kinsley, ’05},
he says:

“I oppose the plan on the following
grounds:

1, it does auay with all possibility
of poorer students working their way
into games etc, by selling tickets or
ushering and instead forces him to
pay cash in advance. It is therefore
uniust to large numbers who spend
for lave than siv dollars per year [or
such events.

2. It taxes one man [or the beneﬁt.
of his neighbor. It may be true that
these things should all he attended by
everybody but in reality it is im-

possibie ior many of us to attend blitV

a small portion of the events, (less
than six dollars worth per year) yet it
forces us all to pay for these things
which we cannot enloyi It therefore
is a burden upon those least able to
bear it and beneﬁts solely those who
are accustomed to attend these events
regularly. These people would attend
Without a Compulsory feel

3. It presupposes all the students
to be upon an equal basis; that all
have equal opportunities of attending
and an equal amount of time for such
things. This Is evidently a. false
assumption.

Itmay be true that it does away
with some trouble to the managers
but it resolves itselr into a special
privilege and is undemocratic.”

(The ﬁrst argument seems untenr
able for nearly as many ticket sellers
and ushers will be required as before,
This Work will still be for students
and provision can be made to release
these people irorn their fees )

One objection has been made
against including the Glee Club con-
cert on the ground that the Glee Club
is in a sense a money makingorgamza-
tron. At least it aims to have 2. sur-
plus iron: the receipts as the home
concern to use in other directions.
To include it would make it necessary
tor the college or the general manage-
ment of the fund [0 advance money
to the club to make its trips.

Another argument against comes
from the iaculty and runs as follows;

“This is in meet an increase of
tuition. From the trustees point or
view that increasesliould go to meet
the delieit or provide :insti-uction
and equipment. This argument‘con’
seems to outweigh all those ‘pro'.”
