be ended with education and adds,
”I’m very willing to talk to anyone
who wants to learn anything,"
Alex, too, stresses the need “to
have more gay people come out oi
the closet and show the diversity of
gay people. The stereotypes are
true ior some gay people, and
that’s fine, but they’re not true for
everyone." He admits that this is
often harder than it sounds. “I
know that what rm saying is
hypocritical because I'm not “out"
to everybody i know, and i don't
even want my name in this "

Most homophobia takes the iorm
oi jokes. according to many oi the
students interviewed. Says Danny
Zion, a junior. “I've seen it
[homophobia]. delinitely It's
outspoken, not so much in public,
but in a private, almost in a Joklng
way." Sophomore Steve Cross
agrees and adds. "I think they
make Jokes so they don't have to
deal with it,"

Marion, a sophomore,
remembers an incident last year.
"A ireshman I know was talking
about how he didn't think that the
student hosts iior prospective
studentsl should be gay, and that
that would give a bad impression
of Grinnell." Carla. too, has heard
homophobic remarks that didn't
seem like Jokes, “l've heard
several people say that they wish
all iaggots would die .Usually,
though. they don’t overtly do it. It's
covertly, like the raClsm here on
campus,"

teas 'n my case, that's simply not
true."

A student who wants to take ac-
tion against a homophobic incident
should ioliow the steps outlined in
Grinnell’s harassment policy, ac-

cording to Tom Crady, assistant
dean of student affairs. “Each incir
delit has to be looked at individual-
ly," he says, “That's an issue
that‘s taken very seriously on this
campus," Crady has only dealt
with one incident in the last lew
years that was Officially (allowed
Ihrough. “It seems to me that
we've seen less of it lately. Now.
I'm not saying that it's not happen-
ing, Just that we're not hearing
about it." More speciiically, Crady
is helping to plan a human
awareness workshop in the next
few weeks that may deal with the
issue oi homophobia, among other
issues.

Carla, too, sees a lessening cl
homophobia in the last two years.
"First. for someone who is unsure
or not gay at all. it used to be really
hard to go to the GCGC [Grinnell
College Gay Community]
meetings. Now, that's calmed
down a lot, and more people attend
the meetings Just to see what's gas
log on " Brown hopes that this artir
ale will help end some homophobic
attitudes l-le invites people to talk
.to him about homosexuality, even
though, he says, “I don‘t think that

 

 

“Homophobia comes from ignorance and
people's intolerance. Also, I think a lot

of homophobia now is a result of people’s
ignorance about AIDS. ”

—Carla

 

Individual student attitudes
towards gays vary. Sophomore
Jonathon Andreas speaks ior
many oi the students in-
terviewed when he says homosex-
uality is “not a big deal." Others,
Such as Brad, a senior. have a dif-
iercnt opinion. “I just don't think
it's natural." he says “It just
seems to me that men and women
are meant to be together as men
and women. .They igaysl can do
anything they want. i just don’t
Want to be around them."

in contrast, Meg Litts. a
member oi Christian Fellowship.
says, “As tor the Christian point oi
View. I do believe that homosexe
iiality is a sin, but in that same
sense, We are all Sinners....l have
iriends who have chosen to be gay.
and I'm not going to judge," She
adds. “I think there's sometimes a
general tendency oi society to
believe that because you're Chris
tian and you believe homosexualir
ty is a sin, that you judge [gay]

letters that we base our
“morality" not in tear oi God, but
in love oi God. This is thought to be
true by Christians because the
New Testament teaches that salvar
tion is not a matter oi good works.
but a matter oi faith, as Mr.
Lol-iaus states, “blind faith,”

ii Christianity is a “springboard
oi moral superiority,” as Mr
Lohaus suggests, no Christian
should be boastiul or condemning
in that iact, but rather loving as is
taught in the Bible.

And by the way, real laith in
Christ is not a “ludicrous” matter
oi “merely" stating “a iew words
and memorizing a iew lessons" in
order to check in at “Hotel St.
Peter.” I would suggest without
any condemnation. Mr. Lohaus,
that that view is simplistic, Just as
someone who wanted to become a
Marxist-Communist would study
closely the writings oi Marx and
not listen to Just anyone claiming
to be a Marxist, everyone wishing
to understand Christianity should
read the Bible ior themselves and
not equate itwith a ”had apple," 7

pus, but with the exception oi’ Babe
bit! and Hart. the candidates didn’t
say much in the way oi speciiics
while they were here. And many
students read The Register every
day...Need I say more? How many
students do you know that can list
Babbltt’s top three issues? Or the
eiiect oi the proposed oil import
lee? Or what Gore‘s plan to
eliminate lirstrstrike capacity is?
Dr which candidates have the
strongest record on educationi Or
the most misunderstood issue
what is Tipper Gore proposing?

All of this lack of knowledge D] or
indifference to the issues was seen
as the round oi applause went up
tor the loss or Bonnie Campbell's
letter, which I must admit, 1 gained
in on. The next cheer went up tor
the postponement oi the discussion
oi’ party platform. Now the inn was
ready to begin. Jackson, Jackson.
Jackson, erupted irom the back oi
the room. Wait, i thought the pups
rally cheers were reserved ior the
Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. Oh
well, it's good to see the Jackson
"Idealists" were trying to get a
iew more oi us to support the can-
didate that we all have hidden
hopes ior. From this point on.
things progressed iairly quickly.
and soon people were leaving by
the hundreds "What about party
platiormi" i thought, i stayed
around in hopes oi catching this,
but alter another is minutes i
needed to get back to the dorm ior
my lourrhourly dosage oi drugs.
and so i decided to toliow my
peers' example and be apathetic
about the party's policies

One other part of the caucus
disturbed me. By running the
caucus for the students, and the
students‘ lack of Concern and
unruliness, we alienated the
townspeople Many oi them have
been going to the caucus since
beiore we were born, and we just
move in and take over. We just
pushed these people aside because
this is our time ior glory 7 our one
chance to attend the Iowa caucus,
Does this make us more important
than them? They have supported
the party since Roosevelt in some
Cases. or even longer. And i bet
that, it given a chance. they'll have
a lot to say and much better
reasons ior it than some or us do, It
must have been bad enough being
one oi 20»odd Gephardt supporters,
but after that, and the locus on the
college in this ward, it must be
enough to keep many loyal
Democrats irom being a part oi
this political process. Next time.

iirm was named “Scheister,
rinagic. Bngult: and Devour," the
man who “brought King Tut to
N'Awllns,” was Jake DiMaggio,

The iirst time I saw him he was
standing on the steps oi the bus,
booming to the above Mrs.
Cadillac, “Yeah, dawlin, kenn ah
sii next ta you, pritty lady?" My
si'llSES picked up the distinct New
Orleans accent whose closest
counterpart comes outta da Bronx.
I instinctively knew that he lived in
N'Awlins East but was raised in
the ninth ward, home oi the expres
sion “Y'at " Jake greeted us with
the telltale ”Hey dawlin, where
y'ut?”

Aiter our guide established the
hometown link between Jake and
me, Jake related personal anec-
dotes about the last two Louisiana
govenors, as well as the last two
New Orleans mayors. He even
gave me the scoop on his late
iriend. Anwar Sadat (the Tut con-
nection).

With his diamond pinky ring
glistening, this obese ltalian man
admitted to knowing my iather
through occasional business lun-
ches l-ie iniormed my aunt that he
had once been stationed at the
White Sands Air Force Base on the
outskirts oi her hometown, El
Paso, Texas. Coincidence, or
something beyond the visible reallr
ty

The world is small indeed, and
Jake DiMaggio claimed his part oi
it through a loud enumeration oi
his iriends. Mrs. Arizona Cadillac
marked her territory by broad-
casting the cars she owned. Are
these people typical oi Americans
interacting with one another? is it
a cultural trait that in uniamiliar
surrounding we cry out the ex-
traordinary qualities that make us
unique?
