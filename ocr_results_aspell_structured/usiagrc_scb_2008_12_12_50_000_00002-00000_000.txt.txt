Terror in Mumbai: a dangerous road

With more than 170 deaths over tilt: course ofa
thteestlay showdown, the recent terrorist attacks in
Mumbai, India (known as Bombay until 1996) ap,
pear to be an exceptionally violent occurrence tor the
state of India. However, while the Mum-
bai attacks show a unique level of orgas
nization and coordination, terrorism in
India is nothing new.

Since gaining Ils independence from
Great Britain in 1947, India has experis
enced periodicepisodesofinternal religious
and ethnic violence. The current trend of
violence, based on Muslim unrest, bet
yn in the State of Kashmir and
Jammu in the mids1980s and
has only intensiﬁed since. The
1980s saw a general growth of
radical Islamic sentiment
throughout Kashmir and
the rest of India, leading to
increased unrest and protest
against the Indian state.

While many Muslims have
ﬂourished in India since indepens
dencc, there have also been high levels
of political and economic discriminas
tion against Muslims within the couns
try. For example, while Muslims account
for around 13 percent of the population
of India, they hold only 3 percent of 1n»
dia’s elite administrative positions While
previous generations of Muslims may have
endured these biases, the current generation
is more educated and more politicized, which
has led to greater tadiealizar‘ion.

One of the most important considerations
stemming from the recentviolence iS how the Mumbai attacks

News Analysis

Charity Butcher, Political Science

will affect relations between India and Fakistanr The two states
have fought four wars since 1947 and have been involved in
more than arty smaller militarizcd disputes. The Mumbai ins
cident has the potential to create a militarized crisis between
the two countries ——both of which possess nuclear atmsithat
could evennially escalate to fullsscale war.
Why would the internal
problems of India po—
tentially affect the Ielas
rions between India and
Pakistan? During the
19805 the Inter-Services
Intelligence Directorate (151)
of Pakistan provided large
amounts of support to Kash-
miri insurgent groups ﬁghting the
Indian government, including mils
ltary training, weapons, and monetary aid, This
support helped to fuel the conﬂict between the
Kashmiri insurgency and the Indian government
and likely continues to some degree today.

In addition, while much ofthc current militancy in India
is “homegrown," there is also evidence that some of the ter—
rorists are linked to Pakistan, though not necessarily to the gov-
ernment. In fact, the only surviving terrorist from the Mumbai
attacks appears to be Pakistani and it is believed that the assail-

ants entered Mumbai by a boat from Karachi, Pakistan.

Since the attacks, India has demanded that the Pakistani
government hand over around 40 suspects in connection to the
incident, who are believed to be hiding in Pakistani President
AsifAlj Zardari of Pakistan maintains that the Mumbai incis
dent was carried out by non‘srare actors not under Pakistani
