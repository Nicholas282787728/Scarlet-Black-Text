Shots

By Ingram.

The Frosh-Coe Flash game should
have copped of! newspaper honors
instead oi the varsity tale. The local
yenrlings displayed a line game of
’ball against the baby Kohuwks, who
were reported to boast a poweriul
organization. The embryo Chicago
gangsters (rain that notorious hang-
out, Langlm Hall, again led the local
freshmen on their rampage. A
lengthy Mormon preacher ably assist-
ed in the ceremonies.

Grimell’s sky-soarers, Green and
Hensely, should be well up among
the leaders in the pole vault, and one
of them may even cop the event. We
haven't heard any reports or out—

standingperiormers in this event. but .

Creighton and Washington doubtless
have several men who can at least
present average marks.

The meet this evening will seoa
classy iicld or dashlnen go to the
host. Pal-ks, Drake captain, and con-
Ierence champion in the short dash
outdoors. will be a slight iavorite.
Curry. Bulldog star, will be Far]:
running mate. 'Howevel', in Erodhage,
Washington sophomore, Parks will
meet strenuous opposition, The Bear
sprinter copped the Valley freshman
meet in a century in even time, and
has been groomed ior this race. Post,
Creighton, our own Sammy Beck,
are others who may break the tape.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

Editor of the SCARLET AND BLACK
Grinncll, Iowa.
Dear Si :

[t has been suggested that tho cuss
topiary scnior chapels he dispcuscd
With. The suggcstion has brought
many protests tram thc seniors.
whether because they rcally desire a
continuance of the custom or nicrcl
he usu the committee d no. When
in t started aud supporlcd by the our
tirc -cnior clas the senior chapcls
wcrc, no doubt. impressive Sinco thc
iii-st your the interest has been roll.
illg oil, until last year wlicn only a
small pcrconlagc at tho scniors at-
icndcd the chapels.

Thcrc are other objections to the
senior chapels. An outstanding pro—
gram on Friday, usually many
that students patronize that chapel.
while the attendance on the other ioni-
days is greatly depreciated. It has
also been stated that the seniors, in
order to gel to chapel on timc, cut
their niuc o’clock cln..es, and in a
good many cases do not go to clmpol
at itll. The method of handling speak-
crs has not been adequately arrang-
ed for. The Senior committee, Work-
ing independently, has in many in.
stances chosen a speaker without first
ascertaining whether he was avail-
able on [he desired date. Consequent—
ly the day ior senior chapel oiten
came around without a speaker, and
some one was obligcd to substitute
in the last moment.

’ It the senior chapels are [0 be con-
ttnucd this year it will iirst he no-
cessary tor the senior class as an ens
tire student body to support them,
This does not seem impossible. Earl—
ier in the year the seniors plcdizcd
to attend at least two chapel services
a week. The womcu have met their
plcdgo well, but the men have iallen
tar hclow. Judging irom this exam»
ple. the support or senior chapel sel-r
vices does not seem probable. Also

These players surged into an early
lead, and although the cue preps tied
the tally late in the first period, the
locals still had sufficient left to take
:1 long lead before intermission. The
second half saw the regulars insert-
ed, and from then on the battle was
concerned mainly with just how '
large the scorc would be.

HDNESTLY

HIS is the worst time or

year that ever was. Not
only is it just to soon to get
new spring shoes but it is the
breaking point tor old shoes.
There’s only one solution that
1 can see and that is to trot
right down to GOODYEAR
SHOE REPAIR and invest in
new soles and heels, new
liits and maybe a dying job.
They do awinlly good work.

AHA~

ERE’S the very place

you’ve had in mind all
along, ior wc know you
should have your wristwatch
repaired and what's more we
know where it can he done
most satisfactorily and that is
at l AGER’S. All kinds of
optical work may be done
here, too — in fact it's the
handiest place in the city or
Grinncll.

PRACTICAL

ND necessary are the in—

look cuter than a bug in a
