A COURSE of lectures has recent-
ly been begun which uiil be or
the highest interest anti value to
history students. This course is
to be given by Professor Parker,
on the general topic of American
History, paying particular atten-
tion to the progress or civilization
from the east to'the west, and to
the development of the western
states. In this connection an at;
count of the early history of Iowa
will be given, which will be a fear
ture of special interest, since so
much of the autobiographical ele
ment must enter into Professor
Parker’s treatment of such a stib
ject. There are lew men now live
ing who have had mete to do with
towa's early history than he,
These lectures Will be given on
every other Friday morning, at
8:00 o'clock. They are intended
primarily for the students of ma-
jor history, but the rule is not iron-
clad, and all those llho are taking
history in any form will be per
mitted to attend. ll isto be hoped
that many can take advantage of
this course. It is only seldom
that we can have the opportunity
to hear Prolessor Parker, and the
chance ought to be accepted when
it comes. The next lecture will
be on next Friday morning, and
SCARLET AND BLACK hopes that it
may be attended as it deserves,

I'r SEEMS to be a fact almost lor-
gotten by college alumni and slur
dents, that SCARLET AND BLACK is
a purely college paper, open to
them as well as to the editors. A
college paper cannot reﬂect all the
various phases ot college life, unr
til the student ieels ties to express
their views in it. This iis tlotte
semi-dccasionaly, but not nearly

liisiitit. rm

as much as it should be, It is
something which would operaleto
the good of students and paper
alike, and SCARLET AND BLACK
it distinctly understood
that its columns stand open to all
meritorious contributions handed
in on subjects pertaining to col»

lege and the college life.

The lnnes Band Concert.

The concert last evening was
the ﬁnest of the kind which has
evei appeared in Grinneil, and tor
an evening's entertainment noth»
lug has given greater pleasure to
a Grinnell audience in several
yeats. The program consisted of
nine numbers but Mr. lnnes very
kindly responded to encores to
nearly every regular number, and
even then the audience was loth
to leave,

Probably the fourth number was
the one which was most thorougly
enjoyed It consisted of two se-
lections. both of which were com-
posed by Mr, limes himself. The
latter of these, a two step march,
“Love IS King." was especially
ﬁne.

The piccolo solo, “Comin’ thro
the Rye.” by Mr, Heidelberg. dis-

wishes

closed the fzictthat Mr. lnlles has

undoubtedly one ot the ﬁnest so
loisis on the piccolo who is to be
found anynlicre. or the encores
”Narcissus" was probably most

highly appreciated by the audi~
ence,

Grinnell is the only stop which
Mr. limes and l‘lS band make be-
tween Onlaha and New York, but
it is probable that a western trip
may be taken next year.

Heidelberg University now has
classes. omeiaily recognized, for
regular practice in ﬁeld spoils.
This movement was made in are
der to reduce the frequency at
student duels.
