Student Meets
Ugly Americans Abroad

by Christine Black

I invited my aunt to visit me in
Austria, lully aware that she was
loud, that she had no German
language experience, and that she
know nothing about Austrian social
behavior, Her exaggerated wave
uhen she saw me in the airport
conﬁrmed my apprehensions.
Alter I had strived for a whole
semester to assimilate into Vienr
nese culture, 1 experienced the ex-
change student's most dreaded
[ear 7 the transformation from in»
habitant to tourist.

As Auntie's guide, I impressed
her with my knowledge of Vien-
nese history and my “fluent" Ger
man. i wanted my parents to hear
about their daughter's talents as
tour guide and teacher.

Though my parents would learn
or these talents, my ellorts were
lost on the Viennese, My aunt‘s
presence betrayed the secret ol my
American identity in spite ol my
attempts to remain “Viennese.“
When you are on the streets of
Vienna, a multinational city,
Americans are easy to pick out.
American women wear more
make-up than Europeans and
louder clothing which often looks
processed, and their voices carry
much more than the local
pedestrians, i tried to disguise my
Americanness by conversing quiet
ly, by inserting numerous “excuse
me’s” and "thank you‘s" into my
responses and drawing as little at-
tention to mysell as possible, i
whispered il i had to speak to Aun»
tie in English on public transporta-
tion. 1 obeyed Austrian society's
rules or public courtesy, and i still

spoke German, albeit with B llat.
American accent. ln restaurants
and inns ! would always order in
German for both of us. The waiters
would reply to my aunt in English
as it my German vocabulary had
never polluted the air.

On leaving Vienna, the charade
was over. We were travelling to
Salzburg to meet up with an
American tour group lor two days
For the foreigner, experiencing a
country with a tour group is com»
parable to observing a chess game
with no foreknowledge of chess.
For the host country, a tour group
is comparable to having live or
more people read a book over your
shoulder Bul how can you tell your
loud ovcrbeariiig aunt that a tour

group is morally unjust for a Grin-
nell student studying in Europe?
obviously it cannot be done
without hurting someone’s feelings
and disappointing the parents.

We spent Christmas Eve with 200
or 300 other tourists in Arnsdorl at
a service commemorating the
birth oi “Silent Night, Holy Night,”
which had been composed in that
town almost two centuries before.
[he service was held in German
and repeated in English, a practice
)nly recently instituted lor the
tourists' benefit, But the activities
which . were pre-planned ior our
group were not as horrific as the
group itself,

T’erhaps my irustration with the
group resulted lrom my unr
precedentedexposure to a flotilla
of Americans skimming through
the Alps. Compared to the polite.
reserved Viennese among whom i
had been living [or four months.
my tellow countrymen and women
struck me as being obscenely loud
braggarts.

The elderly couple sitting behind
me during the sleigh - ride (on
wheels) shouted at ten-yearbld
Ben, "You are just adorable. We

just wanna take you home. Don't ,

you wanna come home with us?"
Without looking 1 could see them
vigorously rubbing his head and
laughing.

I guess the wile was enticing
adorable Ben to her Arizona home
when she announced, “I have a
Mitsubishi so that i don‘t have to
take my Cadillac out when it
rains." Pointing to her husband.
she added, “He has a Mitsubishi,
too, so he doesn't have to take his
Cadillac out in nasty weather.” 1
instantly recognized this as an ex-
perience common to us all. i have
KrMart boots so i don't have to
wear my Pay-less tennis shoes in
the rain. 1 mean. what's the point?
Who cares?

The man who made it wor-
thwhile lor this American-studies
major to be cooped up in a small
bus with 25 vociierously blisslul
Americans. the man whose law

Way back when

______

Aided by student and faculty ad-
visory committees. the Grinnell
Board ol Trustees began its search
tor a replacement lor its resigning
president, A. Richard Turner. in
deciding on the criteria tor selecr
ting the new president, Fritz
Maytag. the chairman ol the board
of trustees, declared that the
trustees were not "looking lor any
major upheavals." Although
among the candidates considered.
Dean of the College Waldo Walker
was reported as saying, “I've told
the trustees I’m not interested in
the position." A feature article ex~
plored the purposes and uses ol
laculty leaves at Grinnell. Accor~
ding to the article, what iaculty
members did with their time ofl
lrom teaching ranged lrom study
ing cosmology and high-energy
physics in Cambridge, England. to
going to Moscow to do research lor
a doctoral dissertation on early
19th~century Russian literary
criticism, to simply remaining on
campus and devoting time to
scholarly.research. At that time,
all [acuity members who had canr
pleted at least six years oi lull-time
work were automatically eligible
{or leave without being required to
submit a research proposal. This
system, however, did receive
criticism, One Concern was that
”some laculty members do not
take [sabbatical leaves] seriously
and professionally" and used them
“as breaks, not in scholarly
ways."

M

The college announced plans to
build a new tine-arts Center “Wore
thy or the quality ol students and
laculty at this line college," in-
cluded in the plans were a large in~
strumental rehearsal room, 300
square leet ol storage space,
several laculty studios tart and
music), two listening rooms. an
auditorium with seating for 450, a
loyer for art exhibits, and a music
library. Construction costs were
estimated at $1 million. The Grinr
nell College Choral Society was
established [or its first year as a
replacement [or the traditional
men's and women's glee clubs. The
principal reason lor the change,
according to the choral director

Don Jones, was that me glee
clubs have had the same type ol
repertoire every year and have not
had the advantage or good
available music." Jones was also
quoted as saying that the change
was “really an experiment. it it
does not work, we might return to
the old system.“ For various viola»
tions oi the drinking rule, a senior
girl was suspended lor a week and
put on social probation, a
sophomore girl was lined 325 (with
no suspendedi, one lreshman girl
was given a 325 line, and another
lreshman girl was given a $15 fine
($10 suspended) and a letter at
warning. Among the guys. a North
Younker lreshman was lined $5
and damages lor destruction to
property, a Langan ireshman was
fined :25 mo suspended) tor a Car
violation, and ”three individuals"
were lined ”a total oi $25 lor

separate liquor violations."
