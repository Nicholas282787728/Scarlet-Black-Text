Charles Mingus: let My Children Hear Music

by Scott Mason

The essence of jazz, along with its
unique rhythmic conception, is im
provisation, and as a spontaneous,
creative art form, it has produced
relatively few composers in the
Western, classical sense. The diff-
erent stages oi jazz have always
been measured in terms of devel-
opment in improvisation, making
ligures like Armstrong, Hawkins,
Parker, Coleman and Coltrane the
most important to the art form. The
field of jazz composition has been
developed by relatively lew men,
Ellington and Monk coming first
to my mind. To Ihis list must be
added Charles Mingus, in a unique
way.

Mingus is, in point or (act, a uni»
one man. One of the leading li-
gnres in post-bebop jazz, Mingus has
been at least partially, if not wholly
rsponsible tor revolutionizing the
role at the string bass in jazz,
l-le_rejected the traditional harmon»
ic/rhythmic function of the instru-
ment to make it a major solo voice
in ensemble playing. In addition,
Mingus has always considered him-
self a composer of jazz, the bulk
or his recorded work being his own
compositions. He has the peculiar
ability to make the men he works
with solo according to his own con-
ception ol the piece, by structuring
the scales and harmonies they are
to work with, Though he has worked
with many major jazz players, he
has always seemed to tollow hisown
path through the art torm. Let
My Children Hear Music represents
an important stage along that path.
Mingus calls this “the best album
I have ever made," and considering
the man’s illustrious career, this
must be a line album indeed. Let
My Children Hear Music may well
represent a linal stage in Mingus’s
work; not linal as in an ending,
but final in the sense of completion
and maturity. With its large en—
semole arrangements and orches—
tral writing, LeI My Children Hear
Music contains six Mingus compos—
itions in their most tully developed
form.

Mingus has worked with large en-
sembles in the past, but much or
this work has been called brilliant
failure, due mostly to performance
ilaws and lack of rehearsal. Let
My Children Hear Music, however,
shows Mingus at his compositional
best, with the ensemble impeccably
rehearsed and recorded. Eachpiece
is unique and captures a complete
mood or thought initsell. OnseVeral
oi the compositions, Mingus has
gone beyond music to include other
terms at communication, “The Eye
of Hurricane Sue” and “Don’t be
Afraid, the Clown’s Afraid Tea” in-
clude related sound effects inter
grated into the orchestration to {ur-
thur convey the desired mood. "The
Chill of Death" features the recites
tion oi an original poem by Mingus,
composed with accompanying music
in 1939. It has lost none of its
impact over the thirty years that
It was denied recording.

“Adagio Ma Non Troppo”deserves
separate consideration inasmuch as
it illuminates an important Mlngus
conception, Originally conceived as
an improvised piano sale that, while
varying in temp and mode, Still re-
tained the essence of a mood, it
appears here as an orchestrated
transcription of the first version.
Mingus here presents a bridge bet-

ween jazz composition and impror
visation. He conceives oi the jazz
solo as composition within an es»
tablished lramework:

Bud and Bird (Bud Powell and
Charlie parker) lo me should go
down as composers, even though
they worked within n structured
context using other people‘scolns
positions. Their 50105 are
new classical compositions within
the structured rorni they used lt
IS too had lcr us that they (Ildll't
compose the whole piece inslcad
of using other people's tunes lu
work within it Ihey had, they would

hnve been put in the same class
as Bartok and Debussywto nnyonr
who knows. it they had cientrd
anything complex, l'ui sure they
could hnvo upset the world.

Mingus iurther discusses thepossi-
bility of an extended orchestral
suite, punctuated in spots bylmprns
vised solos in the style or Charlie

Parker, an intrigueing possibrlity
tor the luture.

To say more about the composi-
tions would be a travesty; they de-
mand to be heard rather than writ-
tell about. A word must be said,
however, about the tine soloists
heard on this album, lor in addition
to his orchestrated sections, Mingus
includes demanding solo spots.
Snooky Young on trumpet is superb
throughout the album, as are Julius
Watkins on trench horn and Lonnie
l-lillyer, also on trumpet. Tenorist
Bobby Jones has been with Mingus
a comparatively short time, but
shows incredible strength and scope
ot playing, as can he heard on “Hobo

l-lo,” a driving piece built on a re
peated bass pattern. Mingus himsell
contributes line bass solo on“Don’t
Be Mrnid, the Clown’sAirald Too.”

in spite oi Mingus's jazz standing,
this album will be accessable to a
non—jazz audience because oi its
unique structure and conception. In
an essay included inthe album(lrom
which the quotes were taken), Mingus
asks that those who have ears lis»
ten to music instead or the noise
that lills so much ot this society.

This album, and others by Mingus
will be aired on lec lrom 7-9PM
Monday night.
