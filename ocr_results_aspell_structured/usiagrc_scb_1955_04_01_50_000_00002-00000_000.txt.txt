To Hank

(The following is a guest editorial by the 1954-55 Council
of House Presidents.)

 

With the resignation of Henry Brown as Dean of Men,
we of tlle retiring Council of House Presidents wish to
offer our comment and our tribute, To a few, Hank may
have made mistakes in judgement or action. To us, Hank
has always acted with the best interests of the’ college in
mind, We feel that his conscientious efforts and wise de-
cisions have made his three and one-half years as Dean of
Men a success.

He has grown with his job, and is worthy of the
sincere respect held by those who know him well, The busi-
ness world has gained a man whom we feel is a fine judge
of character and of human nature, and of what motivates
a pelson to do the things that he does. Grin ell College has
lost the same, and the loss will be felt greatly, perhaps
more than we realize now.

In the most painful matters of decision—stllose which
may affect a person’s future, Hank has most often taken
the easy—and the humaniway out. He has preferred to
give the person involved a second chance, and often many
more.

In all situations, he has only asked that those for
whose conduct he is responsible give him an even break.
In return he has granted them more than that, And
always, he has chosen to work according to his principles.

It has been a pleasure to Work with and know Henry
Brown, We Wish to extend our sincere best wishes for his

future.

THE 1954-55 COUNCIL OF HOUSE PRESIDENTS

 

There Is A Man

by Winston L. King,
Dean of the Chapel

There is a man who lived 19
centuries ago. We know little
or nothing about the first thirty
years of his life, save that he
Worked as a Carpenter, supports
ing his mother, brothers, and
sisters, We know nothing about
his appearance or personal man.
her, and have only a handful of
'his words and a few stories
about him il‘orn the one remains
ing year of his life—for he died
at thirty-one or two.

’vct he made a profound
impression on the people of
his time. He gathered a low
friends about him as he went
around on foot talking to
whomever would listen to him.
They callcd him teacher, yet
were never quite satisiicd
that this name did him justice
—his healings, his vivid
awareness oi God. his contra
dence in a coming Kingdom.
Hence they sometimes used
other names such as Son of
the Highest, and the Coming
One. But. they were all agreed
that they had met no one like

him before.

Then a tragedy befall him.
His teachings about the coming
Kingdom of God did not agree
with the settled Convictions of
the religious leaders of his peo-
ple and seemed dangerous to
their foreign rulers. He raised
too many uncomfortable ques~
tions for them both. And so to-
gether they destroyed him by a
cruel and barbarous kind of
death reserved for political
Criminals. His fearful followers,
broken-hearted and confused,

met only in secret, and began
to scatter to their homes.

But he was not to be so
easily disposed of. Within a
few weeks at most, the inhab—
itants oi the city where he
had been done to death were
amazed to see and hear those
same wretched, icarlul fol»
lowers stand up boldly in the
public square and declare that
their Lcadcr was by no means
dead. Though invisible, he
was yet in their midst they dc-
clared—and were so sure of it
that they were willing to (and
some did) face beatings, pris—
on, and death gladly for his
sake. And by his power they
performed miracles oi healing
like their master.

That was twenty centuries
ago. But this Man still will not
let us alone. His words come
winging across the centuries
with disturbing power, We can-
not rest complacent in our ma-
terial abundance nor remain uns

troubled in our pride as we
read his ”blesseds”.
societies we have built do not
even approximate the Kingdom
he described. We seem to hear
his accusation in the distressed
voices of millions of the dis
eased and oppressed. And there
those who profess .to us on
this 1955th Easter, with shining
faces and devoted lives, filled
with miracles of loving kind
ness, that he is now among them
by his Spirit, even as he was
with the first followers.

No doubt they are right; for
God's truth can neither be
killed nor ever quite be forgot-
ten. His Kingdom is forever,

The best ,

The Sound
i and
The Fury

by A“ Travers

Last week’s column is now
looming as a monument of poor
timing, I had no sooner blasted
one Henry L. Scott for his
blatant mediocrity (And Scott
incidentally was here under the
aegis of the Women’s Social
Budget Committee, not the Con-
cert and Lecture Committee)
when l was fortunate enough to
see Mr. Richard Dyer-Bennet.

I must confess a Certain af-
finity for folk ballads and it
was with no little exception
that I Went to see Bennet. He
surpassed my fondm hope.

His stage presence was re-
markable, and its fineness was
immediately evident in his
preparatory remarks, which
were also sprinkled with his
casual brand of understated dry
humor. He did not allow his in-
troduction to become overlong
or tiring, nor did he permit the
historical data, with which he
introduced some of his numbers,
to become tedious,

The program itself was sufs
ficiently Varied as to type and
tempo that it moved along with

enthusiastic audience with it.
My personal favorites were the
“Vicar of Bray,” the “Earl of
Murray", “Phyllis

and Her \

Mother,” "Down In the Valley” '

and the guitar etude. But there
was attained throughout such
a high degree of excellence that
to Choose one or two as the
best would be useless.

it may have been an accident .
that the Women's Social Bud-
get Committee made such a for-
tunate choice, but 1 prefer to
think that on the contrary,
Henry L. Scott was an accident.
Bennet is a tremendous step in
the right direction. Let’s take a
few more of them.

This was, indeed, a Week of
jubilation. On Sunday night the
Men’s Glee Club gave their an~
nual home concert in Herrick
Chapel, it, too was excellent. it
would be impossible to pick
out a single stand-out so let it
suiiicc to say that the Glee
Club as a whole deserves the
fame it has away from these
greyed and ivyed walls.

Statistics Dept, A source
which shall remain nameless in-
forms me that as of this writ-
ing (Thursday noon) the W0-
man’s Dining Room has gone 14
days without serving roast
beef. There’s a great day com-
ing, brethren. Kneel and give
thanks.

A notice in the noon an-
nouncements for today reads:
Table 15 will float tonight for
guests. A neat trick if it can
do it.

Goodbye and good luck,
Dickie. We'll all miss you.
