Broadway musical which will

be presented in March. The musical ccrnedy‘replaces the stu‘-
dent-written musical, which is presented each spring,

“Action on replacing the student musical this year
with a Broadway musical began shortly after Christmas.
At this time I presented to the Student Council a «proposal

to eliminate this 'year's student
musical in favor of one direct
ed by members of the faculty."

“Quality Production"

These statements are taken
from an information memoran-
dum written Jan. 19, by Robert
Crumption, acting chairman of
the Musical committee. Crump—
ton stressed that this change of
policy was meant to insure “a
high—quality production." not to
dismiss the concept of a ”stu-
dent" musical.

According to Crumpton, poor
productions in the past have re»
suited mainly from ”inadequate
preparation." From 'Don Jones
(music) and Ned Donahoe
(speech) he received a rough
budget outline, including funds
for royalties, score rentals, cos-
tumes,- staging, scenery and ad—
vertising a which amounts to
approximately $300.

L‘ Further Action

Actions still to .be accom-
plished are the following: peti-
tioning of Social Calendar com-
mittee for the dates of March
27 and 23 in addition to the
. date of March 29 which has al~
ready been 'approved; seeking
“written agreement from the
Student Council for the $400

which was discussed previously-

to supplement in the production
costs”; and calling a meeting
for “organizational planning,
preferably within the ne‘xt

week".

Board To Allocate
All" Excess Funds
To Foreign School '

The Board of Religion de—
cided last week to give its
excess funds each year to
only one foreign school. In

given .in small amounts to
several foreign colleges, The
Board gets its funds from
college church collections.

The schdol to receive the
funds is Ahmednagar college in
India: The college, founded in
1945 ‘by Bheskal' P. Hivale, is in
a rural Christian community in

' northwestern India. It had 817
' students enrolled in 1955.

Most of the money will be
used for scholarships, The rest
will probably be used for im-
provement of the physical facii.
ities. Yearly tuition for each
student is‘$125 at Ahmadnager.

Arrangements are being made
for Hivale, president of the col-
lege, to rcome to Grinnell this
spring. He will speak in col-
lege church.

January. Changes will be
automatic if there are depart-
mental cancellations or addi-
tions. other changes will be
made with the approval of the
student‘s adviser.

it is Thornton’s feeling that
“with intelligent long—range
planning on the part of the stu-
dent, careful counselling by the
adviser and accurate depart~
mental schedules, the number
of changes should not be out
of reason,"

New Card System

The McBee keysort cards sys—
tem provides multiple form class
and registration cards with car.
bon backings. Perforations
around the perimeter of each
card are notched out according
to classifications and the cards
are then sortable mechanically.
This will enable the registrar’s
office to sort and handle data
in a fraction of the time form-
erly required. The former seven-
page booklet will no longer be
used, —

“With the elimination of
labor required to correlate data
under the previous system," said
Thornton, “this McBee system
will actually cost the adminiss
tration about four cents less per
student per year. Grinnell is
not large enough to justily a
large, mechanical system on
the order of IBM, but an inter—
mediate syster‘n such as the Mc»
Bee will prove to be quite at»
