DES MOINES, IOWA (Special)7
Only one Missouri Valley conference
game will be served up this weekend
but two other tilts between loop mem-
bers and ancient non-conference foes
wiu share the spotlight with the Vale
ley clash.

The league battle finds the hapless
Drake Bulldogs, completely removed
from the championship station which
they had occupied for four years, en-
tertaining Grinnell Saturday night at
Des Moines, in the White and Blue
homecoming,

Lose 10 creighoon

The Bulldogs were erased from the
picture Saturday night at Omaha
when they lost their first game to
Creighton in 17 years, 12 to o. Grin-
nell, too, suffered a valley setback at
the hands of Washington in the Pin-
neers‘ first loop engagement, 14 to 7.

Thus the battle between the two
Missouri valley cellar. seems to toss-
up. The teams are old rivals and
should stage a spectacular game for
Drake homecomers.

No less thrilling and equally bit-
terly fought will be the , annual
Missouri valley-Big Six combats be-
tween Oklahoma A. & M. and Okla—
homa U., Washington U. and Mis-
scuri.

Bears Meet Bengals

Both of these ancient conflicts ap-
pear tossups. The Bears and Bengals
tangle at Columbia, Mo., Saturday
afternoon as do the Cowboys and
sooners at Stillwater, Okla... at the
same time.

The Aggies, with the valley title
practically cinched, cleaned the Okla-
homa City Firemen Friday night, 14
to 6, running across two touchdowns
in the first period.

week, 34 to o.

touchdowns against Drake, Howard
Gordon, Council Bluffs, 1a,, substitute
halfback, advanced to second place
in the valley scoring race with 18
points to his credit. Ross (Plowboy)
Hall, Oklahoma Aggie fullback, was
inactive in the conference but con-
tinued to lead with four touchdowns
and 24 points.

names, addresses, and room numbers
of all Grinnell students, will probably

to an announcement by Bethana Mc-
Candless, registrar.

George Bonnet of Des Moines was
a weekend guest of his brother Bill.

Dick Ullrich goes into the all-im—

with an excellent opportunity to go
into first place in the Missouri Valley
scoring race. He stands third now

Michigan State shattered a prev-
iously undefeated Fordham team's
hdpe of a national championship
Saturday when she scored an un-
expected 19-13 triumph. Fordham
had been ranked with the eight lead-
ing teams of the country and was
expected to go much farther along
before being beaten.

A fighting Ohio State team out-
smarted another championship con-
tender, Pittsburgh, last week to earn
a scoreless tie. With less than a
minute to play, the Buckeyes were
penalized to their l-yard line. On each
of the two succeeding plays. the Ohio
State line charged offside to smear the

a penalty of half the distance to the

'So far this season the Pioneer fools
boll team has yet to score in the
first quarter. All of their 54 points
have been evenly distributed among
the other three quarters. As far as
opponents scoring is concerned, most
of it has heen confined to the first
half.
The 1932 Grinnell team is not as
far out of the running as people
might think. For example, if the Pio—
neers can win the three remaining
games on their schedule, they will
have undisputed possession of the
title, provided that either Creighton
or Drake beats Washington which
seems quite likely.
