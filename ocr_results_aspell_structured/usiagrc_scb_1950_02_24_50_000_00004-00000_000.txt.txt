lVVictory Over Carls Will Cinch Second Place

Grinnell must get by Carleton
at Northfield this evening in
order to clinch the runner—up
spot in the Midwest conference
basketball race.

John Pﬂtsch’s crew brings an;
873 record into the‘crucial tilt,l
while the Carls have won fivej
and lost three in conference
play. Both schools close Mid»
west competition against Cor—‘
ncll with Grinneii meeting thel
Mt. Vernon team in Darby gyml
next Tuesday night.

it the Pioneers gain their
eighth straight win this 'even-
ing, they can afford to lose to
the Rams and still wind up in
second place with a 9-4 (.692)
mark. In spite of a win over
Cornell, the best Carleton couldi
then come up with would be‘»
six wins against four defeats
(.600) and thus third place.

3rd Place still Possible

But if the Carls should
triumph tonight, and also defeat;
Cornell, they would emerge
with a 773 (.700) total. Then
despite a Pioneer win at the
Rams expense, the Scarlet and
Black’s record of 9-4 (.692)
would ineah only the number
three spot.

Ripon is still mathematically
in the running for second place,
but the Redman face both Law
rence and Beloit on the road‘
and thus have an excellent
chance of dropping a fourth
contest. .
‘Grinnell defeated Carieton‘
here 67—54 in a rugged game
last January. Last Saturday:
Monmouth fell to the Caris by
a 60-45 margin. Tuesday of
this week Carleton whipped its
traditional rival, St. Olaf, 61-53,}

Hank Brown’s varsity grape
pler's won seven bouts by falls
to roll to their second win of
the season, a 3573 triumph over
an inexperienced Knox team
last Saturday in Darby gym. .

Tomorrow the Grinnell mat—
men will face all or some of‘
Cornell college's “A” squad at
Mt. Vernon. The Rams are cure
rently rated as a darkhorse for
national honors.
