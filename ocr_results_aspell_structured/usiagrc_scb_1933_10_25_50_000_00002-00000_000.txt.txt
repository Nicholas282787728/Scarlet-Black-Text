RAH,'RAH, RAH! LET'S VOTE!

One at the most popular of fallacies ill the
American democratic systciu is that one furthered
b the newspapers of the country, in which all

cast their ballots. “We don’t care how on vot 7

Yes. “got out to the polls and vote." Regard-
less of whether you know how your party stands
on a single local, national or international MRS»
lion—“get ollt to the polls and vote." If you need
transportation to these polls, perhaps the Rotary
chill will furnish it. If you live in a large city,
your ward-heeler will furnish it and more besides.
You need not even know the names of all the
candidates on ur party ticket—and yoll have

Of all the asiniue advice in the world, this is
Well toward the top. W’hy should unintelligent vot-

crooked politicians encourage it, hut why should
newspapers, wolucn’s clubs, civic groups, and the
like make it a point to urge a wholesale ush to
ward the polls. without considering the voter’s
knowledge of even the most fundamental points.

Why not “Vote intelligently,” as a slogan for
the newspapers and the soecalled “set 've” clubs?
Certainly, the lnan in the street should vote as well
as the man on Park avenue, but first he should
know for whom and for what he is voting. And it

AUSTRIAN CHECKMATES HITLER
(Minnesota Daily)

A man, almost unknown a few years ago, is today
doing more than any other to preserve the delicate
balance between war and peace in Europe. By keeping
the Nazi party from control of his native Austria,
Engelbert Dollfuss, Austrian chancellor, maintains the
sovereignity of this nation and prevents a situation
which would prove intolerable to France.

The Austrian deck contains a great many cards,
and requires a genius for its proper playing. The Ger-
man ace i‘s the large Nazi party in Austria, formerly
numbering almost 50 per cent of the population. Dollfuss
effectively trumped this ace by his clever use of Aus-
trian national celebrations to stimulate patriotism for
Austria and wean many of his countrymen from the
Nazi plan of commercial, if not political union between
the two Teutonic nations.

Nazi demonstrations on the Austin-German border
and in towns throughout Austria constituted a serious
problem for a time, until Dollfuss, playing skillfully
upon French fear of Germany, obtained permission to
enlarge his army. Since the enlarged force has been
posted on the frontier, German demonstrations have
declined in number and danger. Dollfuss' bold policy
and his defiance of Germany on the subject of these
demonstrations have won him the sympathy and support
of much of the world.

This fourrfth-eleven statesman, referred to by his
admirers as “Millimetternich,” secludes himself for
prayer. before making any important decision, and thus
fortified goes into action, To date, reactions to his
policies have been favorable; he is the man of the hour
in that part of Europe which is opposed to Hitler and
his Nazis. It is not too much to say that npoii this
diminutive statesman has been shifted much of the
burden of maintaining peace in Europe.

first Round Intramural

for Chest Fund;
Halls Co-operate

Five of the six men’s halls voted
this week to contribute the sum of
$25 each to the Pioneer Chest fund,
for support of Young Men's and
Young Women’s Christian associa»
tion activities, including the Uncle
Sam’s club, Grinnell-in-China, and
campus projects.

Women of the college were pledg-
ing individual amounts this week.

The sixth hall, Gates, was to meet
this evening to consider the plan.

Joseph Conard, president of the
Y. M. c. A., who presented the proj-
eet to the men's halls, voiced his lap-
preciation today. “A lot of persons
seem to think that college students
are a group. of hard-headed individ-
uals who don't care very much about

 

"However, results of the Pioneer
Chest drive prove the fallacy of this
view. College men and women are
willing to give up some of their own
pleasures for the benefit of people
like those at the Uncle Sam’s club.
who need the help worse."

Answering arguments for complete
disarmament which were advanced in
chapel last week by Dwight Camp
bell, Jack Maxiicld, pl' sident of the
Council of House Presidents, tics
elared that ”the result of a com-
plete disarmament and lack of mil-
iLary Lr ing in event of war would
be rapid mobilization of inadequate-
ly trained novitiates, and heavy loss-
as in lives, money and property."

“War is a time for action, not eds
ucation," he said, contending
the immense losses of the World
war were due to hasty, incomplete
training and lack of a definite mili
tary policy.

war in no way signifies an intention
of immediate use of the implements

As an example, he cited sivitzerland,
thought of as one of the most peace.
ful of countries, yet having an ex-l
ceptienally well organized military
force.

A militaristic attitude is in no
way encouraged by military train-
ing, he stated. “Let. us as a nation
learn the lesson of our own foolish-

our mistakes or repeat the folly of
those who have gone before uS.”

Stating that steel and chemical
products are gradually displacing
wood, Prof. L. P. Sherman gave an
account of the model home in the
Union Carbide exhibit at the World‘s
fair which is entirely
and furnished with
wood.
He went on to enumerate the re~
eent developments of by-p-rooluets
from ealeium carbide.
"To say that the natural sciences
should take a ten years' holiday to
allow social scienees to catch up is
absurd,” he declared, and stated fur-
ther that what is needed is not less
investigation, but more investigation,

and courage to make use of all dis-
coveries.
