Aggies-Tulsa
Meet Today

Both Defeated Creighton
in Shurtoul Tilts

(Special la The Scarlcl and Black)

STILL\VATER——Thougn admitted-
ly the underdogs. the Oklahoma Ag~
gies began preparing for Tulsa uni-
versity this week in the full expects
sncy of playing the undefeated Tul-
sans on even terms and making the
game this afternoon, at Tulsa,
the greatest football contest of the
year in Oklahoma.

"Dope," such as it is, favors the
mighty Golden Hurricane, but the
Cowboys individually and collectively
are determined to make Tulsa show
more than it has in any other game
this year in this week's rousing con-
lict. '

Tulsa, using fil‘stsstrlng players
only about 20 minutes of the game,
walloped Creighton university 26 to
a, while the A. s M. outfit was forced
to the limit to win over the same
Bluejays, 20 to o.

It was not altogether a costless
triumph for the Aggies, for the hard
line fight against Creighton’s unique
defense saiv Capt. Chet Dottcr sllfr
fer torn shoulder ligaments, and two
guards, Leighton Peddy and Elwood
Kingery, also were removed from the
field injured.

However, all three are expected to
be able to play at Tulsa, though they
may not be in th 'r best condition,
says Lynn 0. Waldorf, head coach.

Not since its surprise victory over
Texas Christian university early in
October has Tulsa university been
”forced,” taking every other op-
ponent by three or four touchdowns.

PORTRAIT ART STUDIOS

For economy’s sake! And
for your own sake listen to
me. At PORTRAIT ART
STUDIOS you can have your
picture taken for a very
nominal fee. Remember this
is a timo when money is
scarce to say the least, and
twelve portraits mean twelve
gifts. There‘s no gift so per-
sonal as your photograph—
because it's you.

LARGES

Honestly, when you have
a beastly cold you’re almost
killed. Aside from the dis
comfort there's those dozens
of hankies to be washed.
You're all wrong. You may
have to stand the cold but as
far as washing hankies you-
’ve got the wrong idea. Why
do that when LARGEs have
Kleenex on sale for 19c a
box. Discounting colds you
always have to use chenex
to rub off the cold‘cream.

GRINNELL CLEANERS

If you can't afford to buy
a new frock send your old
ones to the GRINNELL
CLEANERS for the fresh
appearance a cleaning and
pressing will give them. We
also make a specialty of fine
plaiting and button covering
which will be of interest to
those of you who like sew-
ing. Jean Williams, Quad
representative, will be glad
to take your orders.

GOODYEAR SHOE RE-
PAIR SHOP

Girls: Don't throw away
your old rundown shoes.
Take them to the modernly
equipped GOODYEAR SHOE
REPAIR SHOP and they
will be rejuvenated by ex—
pert hands. Our new system,
by which we cement the
soles to the slices, have prov-
ed to be very successful as
it eliminates the use of nails
and stitches. We have two
prices for half-soling but the
workmanship for both is the
same.
