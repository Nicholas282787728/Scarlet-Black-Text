THREE HUNDRED ’18’ers
ENJOY INFORMAL MIX

Freshmen Get Acquainted all “Y”
Last Night.

The annual Freshman mix held at

the beginning of each college year
took place in the Association moms

last night. Every one of the three
hundred members 0(1918 present have
added many acquaintances and am
other good time to their ﬁrst week
experiences, as c result. '

Each guest was tagged with his or
her name so that roriuui introductions
might be done away with, and an ideal
informal social aim is reported.

Fi-aiiiic was sen-ed during the even-
lug by a committee at upperclassmen.
Prol‘. and Mrs. Bailey were the taculty
guesls tor the occasion.
