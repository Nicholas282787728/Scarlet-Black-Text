Taylor Runs
Relay Trials
This Evening

Duke Declares Differences
Patched; Hurdler may
Run at Kansas.

Miner Pulls Tendon

Pellebier, Mark, McKee, may Make
up Team With Taylor for Meet
This Week-End.

Palpitating hearts of Grinnell track
fans may be soothed again with the
word of Coach Duke last night that
the "hear" stories issued by some of
the campus journalists regarding the
’loss of Warner Taylor to the track
squad were greatly exaggerated. The
hurdle star is back in uniform today
to take part in the time trials to de-
termine who will make the mile re-
lay team which will go to the Kansas
Relays Saturday. There was some
dissension between the mentor and
the runner but it was only a temper»
ary matter.

A far more weighty matter on the
shoulders of Coach Duke is the me
jury of Ianrence Miller, who pulled a
tendon in practice Tuesday after
noon. It means that he will not be
able to compete Saturday, but Pelle-
tier has been doing the distance in
good time, and should fill his shoes
well. Pelletier covered the distance
in :52 Saturday to gather in the
quarter mile iaurels.

While onlookers have little doubt
1hat Pelletler, Mark, McKee and Tay-
lor will make up the team making the
trip, the coach nevertheless held time
trials to give all aspirants a crack at
the team. others who’ competed are
Edwards, Peterson and Macy. Early
season appearances are not favorable
to that record breaking team that was
predicted after the showing of the in-
door quartet but it is not too late yet
for an outstanding mile unit to der
velop into shape.

Sophomores Win

Home Meet

With Taylor, Hensley, Murray and
Douglas proved to he the iron man of
sun-burned sophomores covered the
ground at the Grinnell track like an
April shower Saturday taking the
home track meet with 39 5-6 points,
The dope sheet held almost true to
form throughout the meet with the
seniois copping second berth at thir-
ty points, the freshmen third with
191/2 and the iiiniors trailing with
12 1-3.

The fans got an early glimpse of
something new when they saw Taylor
and McKee step out to take first and
second in the 100ayard dash. A few
moments later they gasped again
when McIlrath, running for the sophs
trailed itisser, veteran senior right
up to the tape and then finished ahead
of him in the mile.

McKee Not in 440.

The seniors might have had more
points had McKee competed in the
quarterrmlle and if Ingram had not
fouled on all three trials at the broad
jump. But the sophomores might like-
wise have increased their total had
Taylor competed in the low hurdles,
till-yard dash and the broad jump.
As matters were the ever-present
Douglas proved to bc te iron man of
the meet, taking fourth in the pole

_ vault, second in the shot put, first in
the high jump and third in the broad
Jump.

A. In former years the awards have
been made by the chairman presiding
at the Gridiron banquet. Since the

mony Wlll be held.

Arrangements are being made with

the local Chamber of Commerce to

Paper to Use

New Typeface
for Headlines

A complete system of lower-case
headlines is used in this issue of the
SCARLET AND BLACK and a coni-
plete set of thltonian type fumily
is substituted for the older style Goth-
ic lettering.

The practice of using lower case
heads was began several years ago
by the New York Herald, now the
Herald-Tribune, chiefly because they
are easier to read, and leading news-
papers have taken it up, more or less,
since. Many college organs which
pride themselves on keeping ahead of
the times use this style of caption.

Although there will probably be
some changes in the styles of various
heading before the new SCARLET
AND BLACK sheet is completed. the
general plan of lower case heads is
to be followed,
