A CHALLENGE TO GmmulLL
WOMEN.

Whether you like it or not, you’ve
got to lace the fact now and then that
there's a (lull: day coming in [he {00
near future when the doors of the
Quadrangle will close behind you for
good; when you’ll he shoved out. into
the World, will -uill\y, face to (ace
with responsibilities that can’t be as-
Called.

For a good many years your mothers
and older sisters fought for woman
suffrage; Whether you
want the vote or not, you've got it;

and won.

and if you use it carelessly or ignor-
antly, or not at all, you’re cheating not
only your country but yourself. The
World is looking to America, we're
told . l . and America is looking to
you, as one of the factors of suspense
in this great post-War drama. A part
In the play has been assigned you, and
the community into which you'll go
when you leave\sc1lool will be which
ing you as intently, as critically, as

that ever

any firstmight audience
thronged a Broadway theatre.

Are you going to yawn and mumble
your lines? Are you going to forget
them altogether, and drift indolently
back to the days when "the ladies,
God bless -'em" wore hoop-skirts and
lace mittens and evcn pettlcoats, and
the

intellie

cui'tsleil weekly to the lord of
household and his superior
gencel
time 1130.
That liter-College Void

The reorganization thIs week of the
League of Women Voters throws out
a challenge to you. its one of the
organizations on the

clinging vines went out some

few campus
which have a. definite. direct bearing
on your life after college. Don't get
the idea that that after-college grip
can he fillet] by your job, or even by
marriage. Not in these days,
Grinncll has made something of a
. name for itself as a college with pros
gressive, up-todlate ideals and activi-
ties.

bors will exIlect you, as

Wherever you go, your ncigh-
a college
graduate, as a Griunell woman, to bc
a leader in community affairs.

The new system of committees on
which the League oi Women Voters is
being established this year will min—
imize the actual study necessary for
the programs, and at the same time
«make‘the work not only worth while
but interesting.

Whether you're old enough to vote
just yet or not, don‘t leave college so
ignorant of the affairs of our nation,
so painfully blank as to our own meth-
ods of government, that you-ll always
be ashamed and afraid to let conver-
sation drift away from gossip or per-
sonalltles. You owe it to your calms
try. to Grinnell, tn the women wb
first fought for suflrnge, you owe it
to yourselt and to the community in

Editor Scarlet and Black;

Will you please extend, through
your column, to Mrs. Flanagan and
the cast or “You and I" my sincere
congratulations on the fine perl'orm-
ance given at the Colonial last Friday.
Every part, to my humble knowledge.
was played with sincerity and good
under-standing oi the character,

Arthur Taguy-Cote.

Editor of Scarlet & Black;
If an inveterate playgcer and lover
of the drama tor a long period, or
years may be permitted to add a few
comments to what has already appeal-—
ed in the columns of your paper re—
garding the production of Philip nar—
l'y’s "You and I” by the Dramatic Club
on last Friday evening, I desire to
submit the following observations.

1f the writer understands the funda—
mental purposc of drama, it is to
amuse and entertain the spectator. Sir
Henry irving insisted on this, and
maintained that it was wholly a sec.
oudary matter that a play may also
may prove instructive or solve some
problem. How wcll “You and I”
measured up to this test of being eu-
tcrtaining was evidenced by the close
attention it received from the alldl~
once that attended its performance,
and the frequent approving chuckles
and laughter it provoked.

I confess I found no‘ immaturity ap-
pnrcot either in the construction of
the play or in Mr. Barry's handling of
his underlying theme. This theme I
conceive to be not the coollict
between art and business, but the bar—
rier (well understood by all except
thc unmarried) which marriage intere
poses against a change of occupation
or profession once established. Here
in Maitland White we see tho attempt
of the head of a family. who is mld«
dle age is in revolt against a daily oce
cupatiou that has pallcd on him, has
rendered him stole, notwithstanding
moderate material success, to re
trace his steps and attempt to realize
the motions 0! his youth which lie
sacrificed in order to marry the girl
of his choice ilaitland White's ex»
periment, of gil g up his business
cal-c - and taking up painting, whllc
not a complete artistic success from
lack of the training that he might
have had it he had remained a bache—
lor, instead of acquiring tho rcspocsrz
bililies and ties of a iniuil, cleared
the atmosphere for him. and qlllckel‘r
ed his determination to iiud a u , for
his son Roderick to secure the mods—
sary technical culrpmcut in architcct—
urc, to follow the natural bent of his
mind. The situatiou that coniroutcd

White at forty is very common. How
many, many men have felt, after fol-
lowing a given line of work, even
Lhougli successfully, that after all
they would have done better in a dllr
ferent career. This is one of life's
great puzzles, and "You and 1” in glvs
lng expression to one man's attempt
at its solution has touched a univer-
sal note.

In any event, Mr. Barry has succeed-
cd in presenting the most charming
and engaging family group to be found
in modem American drama. The tol-
crance and affection and nndel'stzllldv
ing which every member of the White
family seen in the play, iathcr, moth-
er and son, exhibits towards each oi
the olhcrs is sincere and beautiful. I
know nothing like it anywhere else.
The play abounds in chsrm. Professor-
Wallaser criticizes the use of slang
and calls it cheap. I disagree with
him. The acted drama is not neces-
‘sal'ily literature at all. Many
ceediugly cllective pln, s have no liter-
ary quality whatever l‘ "Secret Sel‘»
me", a most engros ng Civil War
play, presented many years ago by
William Gillette, had one thrilling
climatic scene in which not a word
was spoken, ct it was grippiugly in.
teresting. . ost people use slam-I
when they talk. it frequently em
livens conversation that would other-
w-se lack color. in Bar 1": play the
slang is of the sort which gains its
elfcrt by tho use of words, or com-
blnations of words. of fully accepted
respectabili - in unusual meaning and
adaptations. and so used was effective
and humorous. An occasional mild
oath surely harms no one and irc-
rillelltly mnuses, ll found the dialogue
of “You and 1" distinctly vital and
realistic. It was the genuine talk
of the kind of characters the author
intended to set before us. It was dc
livercd in an uuscnsatiorlal, casual,
unhurried manner that seemed like
life itself. I challenge any one to
name another American comedy that
equals “You and I" in entertainment
value, the quality oi being interesting.
in the tolerance and sincerity of its
plot and characters and in its cams
plcte wholesomeness. one feels that
he would be glad to know all the pars
sons of this most unusual play.

It was the writer's privilege to sec
the professional production of this
play, presented last season by an llllle
cast, headed by H, B. Warner and
Lucile Watson, With due allowance
for the diffeiwénce in training and ex»
pcricnce between professional and
amateur actors, it is only fair to state
that the members of 'tlle Dramatic
Club, under the line direction of Mrs
Hallie 17‘. Flanagan, gave an exceeding—
ly good pcrtormancc of “You and I'.
and one which realized for the audu
once. the majority of whom it is rcasr
ouablc to believe had not seen the
play before, a my adequate concop.

A Column 0f Pure Beauty

YESTERDAY some bobbed-hairedrbeﬁ
ty asked us why the Column seemed to
ignore tho inmates of the Quadrangle.
Wo liitcd our collective hat (sue “Etl-,
urine of Gentlemen and College stu~'
lento" pp 437-437 inc.) and answered.
"If that is so, we are sorry. But not
so sorry that our mind's eye is ob-
scured by tears. To be frank, you
women are more interesting obicctive-
ly than cthenvise. You are like the
moon that is most beautiful and allur-
ing when it is near the horizon and
slightly obscured by bending poplars
and scudding clouds. It loses much or
its mysterious charm when it aspire:
to the void of mid-heaven. So should
you stay by the poplars ol enchanting
silence and shun the cold void of the
printed word."

“However, if any Quilline 'l till Quad
feels that she (or bar) has anything of
worth, she should submit her brain—
child to us secure in the knowledge
that we will treat it as our own."

The above proposition is subject to
the law of Plftto, thc llnotypc oper-
ator.
