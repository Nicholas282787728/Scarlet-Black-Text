WHY YOU NEED THIS GUIDE

"It is safe to say that failure to guide and direct study is the?
weak point in the whole educutional muchine.—Prof. G. M. Whipple,
U. of Michigan.

"The successful men in college do not seem to be very happy.
Most of them, especially the athletcs are nverworked."—?mf. H. S.
Caubyl Yale .

“Mlsdirected labor, though honest and Well intentloued, may
lead to naught. Among the most important things for the student to
learn is how to study. Without knowledge of this his labor may
be largely in vain."7Prcif. G. F'. Swain, M, I. T.

"To students who have never learnt "How to Study," work is
very often a chastisement, ti ﬂagellatlon, and an lnsupemble obstacle
to contentment."*l’rof. A. Inglis. Harvard. .
