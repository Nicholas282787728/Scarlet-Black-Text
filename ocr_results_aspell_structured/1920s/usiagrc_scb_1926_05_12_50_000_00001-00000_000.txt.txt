The most modern swimming pool in l
the state of Iowa was assured the
Grinneil strrderits Monday when the
senior class voted by an ot-erwhclrne
iirg majority to pledge $8,000 to the
fund of 515,000 to build srrch a poor.
This action taken by the senior class
is the culmination of weeks of agitd»
tion and speculation on the part of
the student body.

The swimming pool will be built in
Rand gymnasium. It will he white
tiled and marked off with depth
marks and black lines on the bottom.
The dimensions will he twenty feet by
sixty feet and will have a maximum
depth of nine feet and a minimum
depth of four teat. There will be fully
equlpned locker room and showers
and the pool will have the latest pur-
r'fication system. Around the sides of
the pool a gallery wilbe brrilt which
will seat one hundred and thi
per-sons.

To Start Work In June
All swinrming hill be under the dir—

ection of the athletic director and it -

is likely that a regular part of the
physical edcuation work will he care
ried on in the pool. Work on the
project will be started June a, and it
is thought that the pool will be com—
pleted by the time school starts in the
fall.

One of the most seriously lacking
things-at Grinuell has been a pool.
With the largest and best equipped
pool in the' state, swimming should
become a popular sport. Among the
students at Grinnell are several ex-
pert swimmers and the time is not far
distant when a swimming team rep-
resenting Gr-inneil may he developed
to compete against other schools in
the state,

over Two-thirds Raised '

The realization of a swimming pool
is the outgrowth of some talk started
many weeks ago. At that time Mr.
wemhan secured a gift of 51000. This
was followed by smaller gifts and the
idea took form. A serious considera-
tion was given the proposition and fin-
ally submitted to the senior class. As
a result over two—thirds ofthe $15,000
has been raised,

May Fete To Be
Held On May 21

"Ceres and Persephone” will be the
theme of the annnltl May Fete that
will he held on the middle campus
Friday evening. May 21, at eight
o'clock.

The setting of the production is ex-
pected to be very unique. New light-
ing effects will change the campus has
to a virtual fairyland. Pluto's realm
on the one side, and the Grove in
Greece on the other will make a suit-
able back ground for the beautirur
Grecian dancers.

Dances for the fete have been selects
ed from the various advanced classes.
Also, there will he some outside tal-
ent. The work along this line is ex-
pected to he the best that has been
seen on the campus this year.

The composition of all the dances.
along with the direction of the entire
production is under the supervision
of Miss Clara Anderson, assisted by
the senior class in festivals and pag-
eants. Dancing is in charm of Ruth
somers, Dorothy Mirgon, and Evelyn

good rise of this instant to catch tip

Must Draft Capital

“If men are drafted and paid a sale
ary less than irali that which
would ordiirar-i ~ receive, then capital
should also be drafted at half its peace

be drawn on the wealth of the nation
—1hd the wealth of a nation is made

The great legislator was very mrrch
interested in this bill. It he gets a
‘chance to oppose rt again ire will cer»

I tried to get his opinion on labor-
and capital.

"All my platform henefits the labor-
er and the farmer,” he said. “Figures
'trorn the Declaration of Independence
to the present day show that Amer-
ican wealth has increased only at the
rate of four per cent per year. 'Who
got that four per cent? It practically
all went to capital. I think that labor
should have had at least half of it."

Favors Cooperative Elwnomics

Upon expressing a desire to hear
more of his campaign issues I was
informed, "My entire platform is built
around this idea of co—operative econ—
omics. This is my own phrase—orig-
inated after investigating the English
economic system, There are in reality
only two systems of economics; the
co-operatlve and the competitive, and
the competitive has proven to be im—

"How about the condition of Eng-
land today?" I asked somewhat tri-
umphantly.

His reply was instantaneous. “The
strife in England today is all outside

operative system. England is the best
example we have of economic stabil-

Richard T. Ely, noted economist and

that "what is needed is an application
of the sCientllic method to the solu»

Includes l‘liU Acts

Each or the fire numbers which
comprise the program ts an enter»
tainincnt complete in itself. The first
act is a delightful one not play by
Muriel Ratcliff, '28, The cast for this
number is as follows: FepitnsMaur—
rue Par-zybok, and ManolhiJci'oiiic
Hughest these two are engaged); Carr

number is lard in a Spanish garden
complete with its stone walls, balcony
and fountain hathod in moonlight. The
trrne is the present; the therrre roman-
tic. In fact, there is un clopemcnt
with the wrong man; Maurine Pftf'zy-
bok elopes with Jerome Hughes ihr
stead of James Infelt.

The second act is a saxophone quar-
tcttc which has been arranged by Bert
Triton and Mr. Beeiel'. This will be in
the form of a prize package number
as the details are being kept secret
until the night of the performance.

The third act rc called a “Radio
Nightmare” and is written by Howard
Backus. As the title indicates, it will
be a grotesque radio program placed
in a bizarre, expressionistrc setting.
The principal parts in this will be tak-
en by Philip Rinaldo who will be the_
Announcemlold Carpenter who will
be the Bedtime Story-teller; Dorothy
Dewrtt, the Primn, Donna and Howard
Backus the Devil.

be the fourth number. The setting is
the fifth floor of an apartment house.
Eva McKisick, the soprano is Mrs.
Tyler ; Howard Feck, the tenor, is Mr.
Tyler and William Gossen the bass, is
the janitor.

The fifth and most elaborate
is an interpretative dancing act. lt
is a tale taken from Aztez Lore. The
setting and costumes are authentic as
they were designed by Grace Adams
on'the basis of actual observations
while spending a summer in Mexico.
Miss Adams was aSSlsted by Mildred
Onstine. The ballot was composed by
Adele Sehvvarz. The legend is the
story of the sacrifice of a young maid-
en to the Goddess of Life. There are
ritual and symbolic dances,

II ye Singles Star

Although beaten by Drake in a hard
fought match at the beginning of the
present tennis year, Nebraska, of late,
has developed an unusually strong ag-
gregation of netsters, Tire No. 1 man
or the Nehru. a team treated Conkiin,
premier rauh g man for Drake, to the
worst heating that the Drake captain
has ever received iir valley tennis.
Wi i this man facing either- Strublc
or Nicolet in one of the singles mate
ches, there promises to bc a pretty
match.

Grinnell's showing in the Ames
match was very encouraging to Pio-
nccr- net fans. Manager Beein eXr
pressed the belief that the four Scar--
let ritquet wielders would go far
toward winning a large majority of
their matches this year. The men on
the squad who saw action in Friday's
struggles showed steadiness and abil-
ity. Paul Smiley had little difficulty
in downing Shoemaker of Ames, vet-
eran and star of last year. Stroblc
handed the No. 1 ranking Amos man
a bad beating, and Ted Loveioy, pair-
ed with West Stotts, played a nice
game of doubles against the No, 2
Ames team.

Pioneers To Travel

Following the Nebraska encounter,
Grinnell will send a [Norman team on
a swing through central Iowa, play-
ing Simpson, Drake, and Ames on
successive days. The Missouri Valley
meet will he held at Lincoln this year
on May 21 and 22.

Grinncll men who will probably
garner firsts are; Laird, javelin, whose
heave of 186 feet, 5 inches eclipses all
records for that event in theirs parts.
Amos did ndt piece in the javelin
against Michigan Aggies, Meeter
should cop the shot with little diffi-
culty, but will have to heat 130 feet to
heat Kingery of Ames in the discus.
in the hurdles, Davis of Grinnell will
find some real opposition in Witt-oer
and Lucky of Ames, but has a good
chance to run off with five points in
each event, and also a chance to score
in the high jump and discus. Harry
Wing has been hurling himself beyond
the 20 foot mark, and may come back
from Amos with another Honor G to
his credit.

Unforseen things may happen that
will turn the meet for either team. On
paper Ames has several points mar—
gin to work on.

Plans Revealed
For Celebration

Eor weeks the committee for Pio-
DEBl‘ (lay, May 22, has been searching
the encyclopedias in an efu‘nest en»
deuvor to discover some stunts to
amuse the college children on the big
day, Elll Crouch, Willie Patton,

, Maurie Becker and Sherm Allison are

now revealing their efforts to an ex
pcctaht ‘public.

The first event on the stunt program
for the rneu is the wheelbarrow polo
contest, All aspirants are asked to
shine up their vehicles and appear on
the field of combat.

Next is the shocking or clothes
race, Several men rather briefly
dressed will race to a pile of halter-
damhery and attempt to hang it speed-
ily upon their respective persons.

All the stumbling blocks to youth
will be prtt iu the way of the cars in
the obstacle race. A pillow fight on
a bar is scheduled to make the popu-
lacc giggle and titter. A new feature
will be added in the blindfold boxing
match with tin pans as the incentive
to action.

Nor have the women been neglected.
Their first event is the three-legged
race. All roommates are expeetd’ to
