Watt’s Men Enter Combat In Good
Physical Condition For
First Kickoff.

‘I‘WO LETTERMEN IN LINEUP

‘Pioneer Weight Average for Line
Is 180 Pounds, Backﬁeld
164, Team 174,

Coach Lester L. Watt placed an al—
most entirely green tea'm against the
Penn college eleven on Ward Field
this afternoon, having but two letter
men in the lineup. Captain ”Sonny”
Davis and Evahn, tackle and halfback
respectively, were the only letter wine
ners on the team which lined up for
the first kickoff of the season.

One consolation that Coach Watt has
in regard to his first game prospects
is that his full force was able to be
on the field against the Quakers this
afternoon. With me exception of Jack
Locke, and Russ Gray. backfield can»
didaies who were on the sidelines, the
former for scholastic reasons. and the
latter with a foot injury, the complete
squad was in good physical trim for
the first game on one of the hardest
schedules being attempted by any
.school in the midwest.

New Mini ill: Center.

Spectators this afternoon probably
saw a new performer at the center
position, as ' Heldridge, promising
sophomore, and a member of the year.
ling team of last fall, reported several
days ago, and was immediately given
the call at the pivot post by Coach
Watt Heldridgc is a good sized line—
man, and is imbued with plenty of
fight. His pass is the best of any of
the center aspirants. This leaves
Bradley free to work at his regular
guard position, and gives the line an~
other capable substitute in the person
of Barnes, scrappy guard.

“Fuzz" Watt has been shifting his
ends around considerably during the
past week, but the combination that
seemed to impress him most was that
of Briggs and Fall. Both have been
playing fine defensive games, and have
been on the receiving end of some nice
passes during the scrlmmages against
the reserves. Briggs is a graduate
of "Duke" Hayes’ freshman team and
Fail was a reserve and on the great
Hvland machine last fall.

Second Tackle Toss-up.

Captain Davis holds his position at
left tackle above reaches of several
promising candidates, and has as a
running mate at the other sector of
the line, either Klinefelter or Brooke.
Both of the latter have been battling
hard for the position, and some shill—
ing football has been shown by each.
Both men outweigh Davis by several
pounds. thus keeping the weight uflthe
line well balanced.

Parish and Glcland have been work-
ing at the guard berths with Bradley
and Barnes ready to step in at any
time. Both of the former are well
above the 130 mark, and have been
giving a good account of themselves
in practice.

McIntire has been calling the Sig»
nals ‘ with Evahn and Liedtke
at halves and Rose at full-
back. This combination prov—
ed to he very devastating to the re-
serve defense durlng the scrimmages
last week, and should have caused the
Quaker forwards plenty of trouble
this afternoon. Evahn has been doing
the kicking, and his punts have been
averaging in the neighborhood of for-
ty-five yards. lllclntire is capable of
stepping into the booting assignment,
also.

Develops Passing.

‘ A forward pass centering around the
backfield is being developed by Watt,
nnd'froln early indications points to
being a strong factor in the Pioneer
offense before the season has gone
far. With the aerial weapon as a
dangerous threat Watt plans to be
'able to screen his running attack more
completely and deceptively.

The lineups for this afternoon's
game was:

Grinnell: Fail (168) R. m; Kline—
fcltcr (182) R. T.; cleland (200), R.

Paired With Wray Brown, He
Loses Match in Intersectional
Meet. Thursday.

Closing his tournament season

the national inter-sectional meet, with
wl-ay Brown, St, Louis star. as hls
partner/Harris oo'ggeshall was credit.
on with performing brilliantly against
Tilden and Johnston, leading players
of the country, in their doubles match,
Although playing in a very chill
weather the players produced a bril—
liant game, and from all reports Cos-
gesball was one of the stars of the
match, winning'many points after hard
fought rallies,

The rapid rise of coggosball, Pio-
neer net star, in national tennis cir—
cles has been recognized as one of
the most sensational events or the ten—
nis year in the East. Playing in his
first big tournaments, the Grinnell
iunior established himself high in the
upper class of tennis players in this
country, and bids fair to be placed on
the national ranking list for the past
season.

Plays Well In East.

Playing in his first national singles
tournament ,the Missouri valley cham-
pion reached the second round, after
eliminaung a prominent eastern play-
er. Coggeshall performed well in the
Eastern Turf Court championships. in
which event he reached the semi-
finals, being eiimlnated by the winner
of the tournament.

Another claim to fame for the
blond Grinnellian was his tennis play-
lng in the recent Illinois state tourna»
ment, in which event he was within
two points of winning his match
against Chapin, 1926 titleholder, and
relinquished the match only after a
bitterly contested batue. Chapln was
defeated in the finals by Tllden, thrice
holder of the championship.

WRITER’S CLUB TO MEET.

The Writers' club of Grinnell colr
loge will meet for the first time this
year next Wednesday evening at 7:15
in the Y. W. C. A rooms.

The meeting will be short and of a
business nature. A viuerpl'eslblent will
be elected, due to the failure of Mir-
iam McNally to return to Grinnell.

 

Intramural Cross

Country Two Runs

One to Decide Individual Champ
And Other Building Winner
In Harrier Races.

Cross country activities outside of
the usual varsity barrier races will
consist of two runs this fall, accord
ing to an announcement made by fall
athletic manager Mollin yesterday.
One of these runs will be for the in-
dividual championship of the school,
and includes freshmen as well as up-
per class runners who are not varsity
men.

The individual championship race
will be run in the latter part of 0c-
tober and requirements of the run-
ncrs consist in that they work out
daily for three weeks proceeding the
race. individual first and second place
medals wiil’hc awarded to the first
two placers.

High Light of Season.

The annual intramural barrier
race has always been one of the
high lights 'of the intramural season
since its inauguration. Each building
is allowed to enter as many men as
they wish but only the first three men
to finish are allowed to be counted in
the final figures. Regular cross coun-
try scoring will be used whereby the
total places of the building's first
three men will be totaled, and the sum
will determine that buildings station
in the standings.

In the intramural race the usual
number of building points will be
awarded according to the manner in
which the teams finish, and an intra-
mural trophy will be awarded to to
the winning building.

Over Short Course.

The race in both the individual and
the intramural cases will be run over
the short varsity course which is two
miles in length, circling the country
club course and back to Ward field,
finishing with one lap of the track.
The men in the intramural race must
be reported to Coach Dukc and must
take the daily workouts for the three
week period proceeding thc run.
Equipment for both affairs can be ob-
talnod from the athletic department
equipment room, in charge of Carl
Suavely. athletic manager.

The house was deserted. An inde—

The stench was caused by an over
new coat of paint on radiators recent-

Not to the barns alone has the
change been relegated. The very trees
of the camuus have sensed the respite

 

and have put on glorious loaves. A
few more cement walks have replaced
the cinder paths. Even cement steps
have been added to the luodel‘uificftr
tion of Mears in place of the doubtful
Wooden ones which have served heroic.

All in fill the campus is a changed
place. Even the belfry which covers
the “Classic bell” received a coat——

Second Annual Tourney Will De-
cide championship; 01d Stars
Will Compete.

The campus tennis singles suprem-
acy, excepting for varsity letter win-
ners, will he decided in the next week
or so when the second annual fall
tournament will be played. This is
not the usual Beyer's cup match, but
is an individual affair, class status
having no effect on the winner’s
trophy.

The, affair will be an elimination
tournament, with several of the lead-
ing players seeded in order that the
semiﬁnals and finals may be well
fought. The seeding system used last
season was very successful in bring-
ing together four fairly evenly match-
ed men in the semi-finals.

There will be prize awards forboth
the winner and the runner-up. At
the present writing it is not known
whether these trophies will be travel-
ing or permanent. It is thought that
they will be permanent, remaining
win. the winner and runner-up with-
out defending, and new cups instituted
each year.

Jones Outstanding.

There are a number of tennis play-
ers in school, cxclusivc of the varsity
men, who can make strenuous bids
for the championship. Perhaps lead
ing these is “.llbby” .l'oues, lengthy
Langan star from Swarthmore, Penn.
Jones has been playllig fine tennis Elll
summer, and has defeated several of
tho viti‘slty men in practice skirmishes
this fall. a

DeLong, Gary, Ind, star, probably
will compete. and from the game
which he presented last season should
count heav Delong is on the foot-
ball suuad, which fact may keep him
out of the tournament. Harper, Mus—
catine, is a tennis player of note in
his section of the state, and may prove
the dark horse of the affair.

Stowe To Compete.

Stowe, Nebraska state junior cham—
bion, will compete under the handicap
of an injured ankle, but can be count-
ed on to finish high in the tourney.

Phillips, Des Names. is a. tennis
player of no mean ability. He play~
ed in the intramural matches last
your and defeated Jones in one of his
matches. Phillpps stands an excellent
chance of copping the silverware in
the event, ‘

All those wishing to become engaged
in this affair are asked to turn their
names into Larry luollin, junior fall
manager, in Dibble hall, before Tues—
day.

There will be a meeting of the
sophomore class in A. R. H., Tuesday
