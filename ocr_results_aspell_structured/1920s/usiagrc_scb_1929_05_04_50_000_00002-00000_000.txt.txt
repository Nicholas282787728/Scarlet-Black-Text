Chapel Changes

With President Main’s our
ilolmceinent Friday morning that
eight o’clock chapels would be
substituted for ten o’clock ser-

No. 53.

Vices starting Monday. Grinllell
was prepared for an interesting
experiment. But although the ex-
periment may be interesting, we
wonder whether it will be success-
ful. The reason given for the
change, that it will assure an un-
interrupted working day cannot
be refuted. ‘
Another advantage of the ten
o’clock chapel is its likelihood of
attracting more students. The un~
dergraduate after being subjected
to two-hours of quizzirlg is apt to
be awakened and more responsive

 

to the sp ituul urge or whatever
it is that drives people to chop-
el. However to place the services
at the opening of the morning
program and expect the student
who has probably overslept the
breakfast time to satisfy his spir-
itual needs more than his physir
cal ones is to demand of him a
sacrifice. the performance of
which should place him in the
martyr class.

W’e realize, of course, that
these two arguments may not be
enough to outweigh the many “11»
slated reasons which lie behind
the change but, nevertheless, we
believe them to be valid objec-
tions to the substitution of all
eight o’clock for a ten o’clock

chapel.
