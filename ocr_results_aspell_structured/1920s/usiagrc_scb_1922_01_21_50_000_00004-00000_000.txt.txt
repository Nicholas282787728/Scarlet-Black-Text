Ey winning their ﬁrst game twin
Washington on the Pikers’ floor last
night. the pioneers appear to have at
last hit their stride. The Griunell
cagemen have. been working under dc-
cided disadvantages up until the pres-
em. but with the worst pit“. of their
season behind them it is expected that
their efforts will be crowned with
more success during the remainder of
the season than they have experienced
heretofore.

The Pioneers have not only been up
against the strongest teams in the Val-
ley so far but they have been aiso
handicapped by being forced to play
these teams away from home. The
Missouri game tonight at Columbus is
the last game which the locals will
play in foreign territory until they
meet Amos at lime in their last con—
ference game of the season.

Heavy Schedule Ahead
The ﬁrst home game of the season
will be the contest with Cos which,
due to‘ the pour showing of the Cue

one of the most severe tests which

in; strong and it looks like a battle
royal when these two old rivals get an
opportunity to mix. Cornell, Okla-

rapid manner which has characterized
their work for the past few weeks.

Recreational Hour
- , Held Last Evening

A Rec hour was held in the Rand
gymnasium Friday evening. The time
from 7:30 to 9:30 was spent in duller
ing, and Miss Read, Mrs. Cline and
Mr. and Mrs. Bridge acted as chaper~

Constiences of
Quadites Put
. To Severe Test

01d ivory, youve got the world
[beat Fat show us the girl who can‘
illeilsul'e up to your 99.14% pure And
hthe test of it all is this:

Have you ever cheated? i

Iiave you ever consciously lied?

Have you ever had a cinshl ‘

Have you ever been but that is a1
fftil‘ sample. We will go no further.

There are ten of them, and unlike
the grade average. it is impossible to
go below zero We are thankful for
small favors

“Morality tests" have swept the quad

with probably greater vigor than if
they were more than, well, experiv
ence tests. And they say, even in a
college community, that experience is
the greatest teacher.
. who calls me a cheat and a liar and
still lives? Yet have I ever Cheated?
Have I ever lied? Well, whose busi—
ness is it anyway if I have? ' ’

But as a fairer test we would plea
pose a few questions such as the fol-
lowing:

Have you ever chewed tobacco?

Iiave you ever felt a desire for a
third helping at the table?

Have you ever condemned the cut
system even in your mind?

Have you ever expressed regret at.‘
being previously engaged when you
felt none?

Questions such as these we believe
would be a fairly reliable test of {he
moral tone of the school

For the beneﬁt of those who have
not been able to take the “morality
tests," we are ouoting the most su-
thoritative list in their exact wording.

1.1-1ave you ever cheated?

2. Have you ever told a lie con-
sciously?

3. Have you ever had a crush?

4. Have you ever dressed improper»
U7

5. nave you ever danced improper—
1y!

6. Have you ever been kissed?

7. Have you ever ’smoked?

8. Have you ever drunk iutoxlctw
ing liquor? ‘

9. Have you ever done anything
which you would care to conceal from
you‘; parents:

Have you ever been on a petting
party! ,

To aid those who do not know the
rules 01 these examinations we might
say that each question counts 10%
and the closer one gets to 30%, the
closer. one gets to the standards set
by the one House Chairman. We
thank You!

Gornhusker Graduates Demand
Administrative “Houseclean-
' ing” at University.

The resignation of F. W. Luehriug.
athletic director at the University of

Nebraska. to accpe the directorship‘

at Minnesota Univclslty, has inspil’ea
the resentment of Culullnskel' gr'ldr
uates, who are organizing in Lincoln
and Omaha, to demand of the board

of. regents an administrative “house.

cleaning" at the University.

After Wiring President Coffinan at
Minnesota, of his acceptance, Luchr-
ing left tonight to consult with the
authorities at the Gopher institution
concerning the reorganization of the
coaching staff.

The time of huehiing's ‘assumption
of his duties at Minneapolis will de:
pend largely on the willingness of the
Nebraska authorities to release him.
as his term of office does not expire
until June I, 1922.

Altho accepmnce of the Minnesota
directorship involves a substantial in-
crease ih salary, it is understood, that
lack of desired cooperation on the part
of the head of the Nebraska admin-
istration was the prime factor in DI—
rector Lueuhring s decision to transfer
his activities to the Gopher school—
Daily Kansan.
