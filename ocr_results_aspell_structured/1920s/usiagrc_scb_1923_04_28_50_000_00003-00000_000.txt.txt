Keep It In Grinncll

There was a time when Geinnell people had to
go to Des Moines or Iowa City or other neigh-
boring villages to hear symphony orchestras.
Now people come to Grinnell from all those
places and more, too We want to keep them
coming, don’t we?

There‘ is only one way to do it, and that' is for
all Grinnell to stand together. 'All Gi-innell
meansbusiness men, lawyers, doctors, students,
housewives, faculty, preachers, congregations,
employers, employee, men, women, and children.

Keep the Festival in Grinnall.
