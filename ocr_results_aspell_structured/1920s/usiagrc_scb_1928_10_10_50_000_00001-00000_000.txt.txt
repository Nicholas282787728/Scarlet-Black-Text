Famous Symphonic Choir Presents
Program of Sacred, Folk,
and Classical Songst

HAVE ORCHESTRAL EFFECT

Dedovitch, Tenor soloist, Pleases
Fairly Large Audience With
“Psalm No.1."

Much interest centered in the ap-
pearance of the Russian Symphonic
Choir in the Herrick chapel last Mona
day night, for it is seldom that an op-
portunity is afforded of hearing a pr0r
gram of Russian sacred, tolk and clas-
sical songs sung with native eloquence
and enthusiasm, It is infrequently in-
deed that an organization of the calla
bre ol the Russian Choir sings to
any other than large city audiences,

Arrayed in old world costumes, the
Russian Symphonic Choir thrilled the
fairly large audience which turned out
to hear the first musical event of the
fail musical season.

The Russian choir presented a pro-
grain of sacred music and classical as
well as folk, street, humorous and
dance songs, a program challenging
attention because of its sharp con-
trasts, its daring and infectious hu-
mor.

Amingements During.

The program of the Russian Sym-
phonic Choir, as arranged by Basile
Kilmlchich, its director, contained a
good many musical numbers which
were originally written for orchestra
or piano and which he has ably ar-
ranged for his chorus. Some of his
arrangements might be called daring,
if it were not done so masterly. But
it took a great deal of courage on the
part of Mr. lfibalcbich to arrange for
his choir an excerpt from the slow
movement of Schubert's immortal
Eighth Symphony. He did it only be-
cause last season witnessed world
wide celebrations of the composer’s
0ne~hurtdredth Death Anniversary,
and this was the only way Kibalchleb
could pay tribute to the great master.

The principal soloist heard Monday
evening was Mr. Dedovitcb; whose
viriie and vibrant voice was heard in
Archangelsky’s “Psalm No. 1." He was
accompanied by the choir which gave
an excellent impression of an orches-
tral accompaniment. He gave good
reason for the enthusiasm with which
the audience received his number. The
singing of Mme. splikevitch was so one
thusiastically received by the audience
that they repeatedly called for an one
core.

nine Technique

It is quite possible that the Russian
Choir would not claim that their or-
ganization did not possess all those ad-
mirable qualities that contribute to
the making oi a perfect choral organi-
zation; but admittedly they have all
the highly—specialized technique and a
pronounced effective expertness in the
matters of coloring, shading and grad-
ation of tone.

It required littlc imagination as
Gluck’s “Tammi-n Ergo" was sung to
hear the various instruments of the
orchestra as the individual voices of
the Russian cho \lr. l<ihaichich has
scicctedn who with careful regard
to timbre and his Ireqnent use of the
bummed tone bore out the first im-
pr on of hearing a human orches-
tra.

In all its attacks and in nearly all
its rcicases the choir is highly [Holler
icnt and its response to Mr. Basile
ltihalchich‘s subtlc and delicate infll~
cations of pitch, phrasing and nuanc-
ing were ready and exact,

There can be few, if any, oi those
ClIOIl' last Monday night who would
not encourage it in its splendid mISr
sion of familiarizing the people of the
United States and other countries with
the emotional power and diversity oi
Russian music.

Grinnell Holds Powerful Kansas
Eleven Scoreless for First
Three Quarters.

After holding the powerful Univer-
sity of Kansas team scoreless for
three quarters and threatening to
score it number of tunes, the Grinnell
college football team experienced
their first defeat of the year last Sat~
iii-day at Lawrence, Kansas.

Improved by the experience of the
Penn college battle a week ago, the
Pioneers showed real class in stop-

After much subsequent question»

into a large room filled with long
tables where girls in white aprons
worked, inspecting sheets of printing
for misimpressious, dirt, oil, or blurs.
Here at one of these tables, in a. sinii»

Tilts With Iowa. State Have Been
Thrillers In Former Years
According To Scribe.

Fans expecting another of those
thrillers which have been staged the
last half-dozen times Pioneers have
met Cyclones will probably find the
Grinnell-Iowa State battle to be
staged on Ward field before home-
coming crowds Saturday to their
liking. That “Morgan Taylor pass"
which brought victory to the local
camp four years ago; or the touch—
hacks which Johnny Hehrn, Ames star,
made to turn probable defeat into a
tie with Griunell three years ago; or
maybe the two dropkicks which which
just inlssed giving the Pioneers three
points and making Gordon Meeter the
hero of the day are all possible turns
of the battle,

Grinilell is in the same position
Saturday in which lowa Stated played
before a similar assembly two years
ago. That day a team which had
just lost two Missouri Valley tiffs
through inexperience held a Pioneer
team composed of veterans of three
years with a record of impressive
victor-i s to a tie score.

as to how to get about in Chicago,
and fifteen dollars to live on until the
first pay check, went out into the lace
tor-y district, posing as an ordinary,
uneducated, working girl, to find
work, and study at first hand the real
life of the factory girl,

A little Polish girl loved prctty
things, and wore soiled pink or l'olnne
egg blue lacey dresses to work. She
liked Filipino men better than Amer-
icans, and liked to tell about the "Hot-
stepper" who took her to Filipino
night-clubs. A Hungarian girl who
was not living with her husband was
very eager. to have Elizabeth come
and stay with her. Little fifteenryeztr-
old “Collegiate" wondered what was
the use of going home, anyhow: home
didn't mean anything to her. A Game
olic girl was not going to vote for
Al Smith because if he wasn't crooked
when he went in, he would be when
he came out.

There was not one of them who was
unkind or unfriendly, All of them
were glad to take her to their homes
and to welcome her as one of them,
The fact that she was a “country girl"
interested them greatly. “Don't they
have street ears in Shenandoah?"
"Don't they even have buses?" “Why.
I’ll betcha if I was to walk down the
street there they'd be shocked be-
cause i was from the city."

“But, after all," Miss Webster com-
mented, “they weren't so different.
Their standards of living were lower,
of course, but, after all, they were
pretty much the same as any other
girls,"
