Many Grinnell girls had interest—
ing summers. but few can boast of
such varied experiences as Jane
Lewis. Miss Lewis, with Adelaide
Baker, ’28, and Josephine Bailey, ex-
'31, of Washington, Iowa, composed
one of the peace caravans sent out
by the American Friends Service
committee of Philadelphia. The
Quakers have always been interested
in peace and this summer they hop—
ed, through peace caravans, to inter-
est the people of several states in
world peace. a

“We left Grinnell in a sccon hand
Ford on June 11," Miss Lewis said,
“and upon arriving in Philadelphia
attended a three—day conference of
ﬁll the caravans. Harvard, Welles-
ley, Haverford, Swhrthmpre, Wiscon-
sin, Penn, and Grinnell were some
of the colleges and universities rep-
resented."

Lewis Meets All Kinds and Conditions

‘ , of Humanity on Summer Peace Tour

“One of the most interesting meet<
ings was held in the country not
far from Fairfax. Virginia," Miss
Lewis said. "We spoke before a
group of negro Odd Fellows in an
unfinished cabin, furnished with
backless benches and lighted only
with lanterns. _ Our audience was a
very appreciative one; they laughed

at our jokes and listened attentively _

as we spoke. Although they lived in
a poor and undeveloped section of
the state they seemed intelligent and
quickly fell into the spirit of the
meeting."

”A second interesting meeting was
held in a section of country fifty
miles square in which there was
neither a church nor a schoolhouse.
The men before whom we were to
speak were all moonshiners. The
country was so poor that col-n was
the only crop that could be raised
and to transport it they had to turn
it into whiskey. Some men ac-
compsnied s to the meeting, as we
had been Warned that most of the
programs given in this vlclnity were
interrupted by the audience before
they were brought to a close.

Secs Shenandoah Valley

Thirty men were in the room when
we arrived, a quiet and orderly gath—
ering, and as the evening progressed
we rather fearfully awaited the com-
ing of the moonshiners. Imagine our
surprise when, at the close of the
meeting, we discoyered that every
man in the audience was a moon-
Shiner! We had ﬂattered them into
good behavior by our assumption
that they were law-abiding citizens."

"Our next stop," Miss Lewis con-
tinued, "was in the historic Shenan-
doah valley. We made Winchester.
the home ,of Commander Richard
Byrd. our headquarters. The Quak-
ers there~were hospitable, entertain
ing us in their homes and ar-
ranging meetings for us. We work-
ed up and down the valley for two
weeks and brought our work.to a

Kerr Pageant
Will Feature

Homecoming

Andersen to Direct Symbolic
Drama Divided lnto
Two Parts.

Old Records Used

J. CB. Grinnell and Other Ancient
Figures Found in Caste
for J llbilee.

“The Pioneers of Progress," a his—
torical pageant written by Robert
Kerr, will be one of the features of
the Grinnell Diamond Jubilee, and
the rehearsals under the direction of
Miss Clara J. Andersen have been go-
ing forward rapidly.

Ten episodes with four symbolic
dance interludes make up the_page-
ant, which is based on the old rec-
ords and conversations with pioneers,
particularly Mrs. R. M. Haines who
came to Grinnell in a covered wagon.
Included in the cast of characters is
“J. B. Grinnell," A. J. Blakely, Jr.;
“Horace Greely,” Rev. E. M. Vittum;
“Prof. L. F. Parker, The College in
the Sixties," Dean J. S. Nollen; “Mrs.
L. F. Parker, Lady Principal," Mrs.
Grant Ranisey; “John Brown," Prof.
L. P. Sherman; “Col. Cooper," Dr. E.

E. Harris; and others. J -

John Brown Shown

The first episode of the
pageant shows J. B. Grinnell
and Horace Greely in New York and
gives incidents relative to the qqu
tation “Go West. young man, go
West" by Horace Greely. Second
comes the "Decision regarding town
Site," in which Grinnell, Hamlin and
Holyoke participate. ”The Arrival of
the first family" in a covered wagon
follows, then comes the "Meeting of
the Iowa Band" and consecration.

Next the “Merging of Iowa college
and Grinnell University," showing
the entrance of the first students
who were received by Prof. and Mrs.
Parker. The "Dance of the Prairie
Fire” is next and then comes _the
“John Brown" incident. and an epi-
sode which shows a pioneer home as
a station on the underground rail-
road.

‘Movlng Plcture'

An informal husking bee is in-
terrupted by news of the outbreak
of the Civil War and then is shown a
meeting of a college literary society
with young R. M. Haines rushing in
with word that the war was over.
The coming of the first railroad is
not forgotten and there is a discus-
sion which shows the attitude of the
early settlers toward this great
event. The attempt to found a sa-
loon and its defeat are also graphic-
ally portrayed. .

As a finale a symbolic group is
posed and behind it and the gauze
curtain loaned by Mr. Walsh of the
President Thater of Des Moines
pass all the characters in review as a
sort of moving picture of the history

 

of Grinnell.

 

Freshmen, at School

but Two Weeks,

Already Show Signs of Growing Up

our baby preps have

over night! .

Two short weeks ago they were
timidly endeavorlng to follow in the
footsteps of their reverend “sire.
They religiously stifled yawns and
jerked back nodding heads that they
might succeed in staying up just a
Wee minute longer and keep colleg-
iate hours. . e =

In the dining room they shyly
demonstrated their dainty appetites
and exquisitely perfect social graces
which they had spent months acqulr-
ing. The feet were very flat on the
floor, the hands were tightly folded
in the lap, and always, "if you
please," and "I thank you kindly!"

The first day of school the Grin-
r'iell babies began to grow up. Many
had to be led safely into the arms of
some kind and soothing klndergar»
ten teacher. others independently

grown up

ﬂourished their brilliant orange
cards and rushed into Chaucer, ad—
vanced experimental psychology and
ethics classes before they ventured
to inquire from some distressed
mamma or papa the way to English
A. Section 3.

But those days are gone forever.
and slow but sure these ignorant
Preps are, turning into typical Grin-
nell scholars and flippers. They are
acquiring a nonchalsnt and Sophistb
cated air toward their honorable eld—
ers. They casually mention “the hot
date at Saturday: Varsity” and
"cutting the 8 o‘clock for a snooze."

Some bold spirits have even dis-
covered thc hidden charm of the
chilly. muddy waters of famous Ar-
bor Lake. Others- proudly dig
enormous dust covered volumes from
the darkest corner of the stacks.

Yes, the babies are Preps no long

 

erithey are grown up Freshmen.

Locals to Win
Penn Grid Tilt

, Tackles.

Ruff Sent to Hospital

Ollie: Upset Comes as Klinefelter,
Humphrey Named to Grace
Sidelines.

Captain Harold Rose
his
est

will lead
Pioneer gridmen out on the field
2:30 p. in. today in what, with
the absence of Ruff from the line-
up, may prove to be a hard game’
for the first of the season. Grin-
hell is doped to win by an over-
whelming score, however.

Coach Watt, although not certain
as to his exact starting lineup, this
morning announced that he would
probably start Bllto and Mlnier at
the ends, Walker and Tipton at
tackles, Parish and Heldridge at
guards and Holman at center. Eith-
er Thomas or McIntira will be at
quarter, Richey and Douglas at the
halves and Rose st fuuback.

New Tackles Installed
While Briggs has been out of
practice during’ the past week be-
cause of an injured leg, he‘is in
shape for the fray and will prob-
ably see action. Bilto has been
playing a gre’at end game and
should find his baptism no hard-
ship.
The real upset of the day is the
statement by Watt that Humphrey
and Klinefelter, regular tackles of
1928, would probably grace the
bench at the start of today's contest.
This is' chiefly to give' Walker and
Tipton more experience," but both
men are good linemen line? will push
their way to the front throughout
the season.

Penn HRS Veteran Backs

There is no hope of any of Ruff’s '
sensational passing today, since that
youth went to the hospital yesterday
for an operation to relieve a. severe
charley horse. Coach Watt said that
he would -be back in shape for the
Iowa State contest at Ames next
Saturday, however.

Coaches Sanderson and Gowan of
Penn have a strong squad to battle
the Pioneers today. Five veteran
backs will do their share in advanc-
ing the ball, Avon Coy y, Norton,
I-libbs, Bellman and Stiles being the
lettermen who are touted as tool
grldrnen.

Ame: Holds Interest

At the wings the Quakers will
have' Black and Pemberton, and
Stewart and ‘Preston are likely
choices at the tackles. Captsln- Hi
Covey and 'Clyde Six will probably be
doing work at the guards although
Covey may be at center. If this is
decided upon either Famsworth or
Gallegher will get the guard berth.
In case Covey plays guard Phillips
will probably get the call for cen-
ter.

Mississippi Six to Play
for Initial Varsity Tonight

The Mississippi Six will play for
the opening Varsity dance tonight at
eight O'chCk in the women's gym
and will be sponsored by the student
council. Frank Furbush and his or-
chestra played for an informal
dance which followed the torchllght
parade last night.

Intramural Tennis Meet
to Get Under Way Soon

James Clarke, student chairman
in Grinnell
college this season has announced
that the fall intramural individual
tennis tournament is to get under
way at once. All men who have
never played in a varsity match are
eligible to compete and should see
him at once.
