A movement on the part oi a large

Grinnell Thursday night or Friday
morning in anticipation ot a ilunk day
has caused a committee oi upper-class,
ment to unite to call hit the ilunk day. ,
This action was taken because rt was,

feels that the student body is taking

,through the longest and snapplest

Preparation tor Saturday's battle at
Drake, The team worked to advan-
tage against the Fresh squad, and the
practice was altogether sntisiactor-y,
Indications are that Gl'innell will at»
tend the game in Des Moines in a body.
Everywhere may be heard the enthusi-
rastic query, “Gmn to Drake?" and the
answer is in the attrrmative in a vast
majo ty oi cases. Grinnell is going
to Drake to ﬁght, and ii the Pioneers
gd‘ down to deieat, it will not be he-
icnuse oi a scarcity oi sideline hack-
lers. Enthusiasm is expected to
reach its highest pitch oi the season
during Saturday's contest,»iust as it
did at the Iowa game at Iowa city in
1917, in spite oi the fact that the game
is played away ir-onr home.

it clriu Out.
Although Whitehill, one oi the main-
stays oi this year’s backﬁeld, suitored
injuries in the Washington game which
will keep him out oi the Drake con-
test, a new backﬁeld aspirant has
come to the fore this week in the per-
son oi Harry Gray, a iormer tackle on
the Alhia high school eleven. Gray
possesses plenty oi weight and speed,
and he hit the line and skirted the
ends last night in a manner which
made the spectators smile.

Hits Olieusive Strength.

No serious shakeups are expected in
the Pioneer lineup ior Saturday‘s
game. Although the , team lost to
Washington in thc ewsing nrlnutes'oi
their battle here, it showed consider»
able strength on hotb oiiense and de-
ieirse, and should make the Des Moiues
gridiron artists hustle.
Coaches and players here are mak-
ing no mistake as to the strength of
the Bulldogs. Although Banks' men
have met detect twice in Valley games,
those have been at the hands oi the
strongest teams in the Conicrence, and
by very small mar-gins. Kansas was
barely able to pose Drake out by tour
points on the iormer's home ﬁeld, and
Missouri, the conqueror- oi Ames, bat-
tcd every inch oi the way ior her vic~
