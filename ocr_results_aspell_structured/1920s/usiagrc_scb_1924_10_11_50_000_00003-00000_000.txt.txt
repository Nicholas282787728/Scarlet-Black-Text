Techow, snnntung, China.
September 3, 1824.
My dear NI. Bradshaw:

We had three days'in Vancouver her
fore sailing and took full advantage or
them by going sightseeing every day.
Wle sailed August 14 on the Empress
of Canada, the largest liner on the res
cifio and an oil-burner. The trip
across was most pleasant and included
all the thrills i had expected. we
saw several whales, two hoats and a
few birds during the entire ten days
from Vancouver to Yokohama.

We landed in Yokohama the mom-
his or the tenth day. i don't believe i
have seen anything more pitiful than
the conditions that have resulted from
the destruction by. earthquake and
fire The pier at which we docked,
said to have been the ﬁnest in Japan,
is new a mass of wreckage. The en»
.‘tire central part which was the freight
shed and passenger station, have dis—
appeared below the outer or been
burned. Sectolding holds in place
what is lei-t of the concrete, and the
outer pier is connected with the land
by a wooden bridge. Hundreds of
workmen are now husy hauling away
twisted steel and concrete dehris and
are using these to fill in the portion
or the shore line that sank below the
water. A few brick or concrete wnlls
are standing hut in every case they
have heen made unsafe by the shock

_ of the quake. The new structures, tiny
'wooden shops and homes, all look very
fragile and temporary. There are no
trees; everything looks dosclatc.

Tokyo seems to have suffered less
from. the quake and is said to he six
months ahead of Yolrohnrna in the re-
construction worlt. Wide streets,
modern trams, many automobiles, puh—
lic parks. and the irequency of Euro—
pean costume make Tokyo most inter
esting to the inreigner.

It was’ Kobe, however, that made the
greatest impression on us. This city,
nestling between the hay and the
mountains, is picturesque from tirst to
last. The people, cleaner than most

. orientals, are very pleasant and treats
ed as with every courtesy. In tact,

and tracks were patrolled by railroad
policemen (armed). We reached hin-
cheng by night. You will recall that
this place was the scene of the daring
hold-up by Chinese hrigands which
was described in the “Atlantic" some
time ago, it was at this station that

two scarchlights were mounted on the
rear coach of the train, iilty armed
guards patrolled the platforms st the
ends of the coach, and two machine
guns were mounted in a special car
on the end of the train.

I said just above that Shanghai is
most discouraging. It is. But Shang-
hai isn't china—or cven Chinese. It‘s
it foreign settlement and shows of! the
very most undesirable DC Chinese
characteristics. Once out or Shangs
hai you really see China—stolid, sub-
stantial, dirty China not picturesque
in spite of the dirt. Southern China,
because of the mountains, is really

Techch is most Interesting. The
compound, or campus, is located outc
side the city wsll, perhaps two miles
from the station. it is surrounded by
a. brick wall which protects it from
both robbers and floods. There is a
