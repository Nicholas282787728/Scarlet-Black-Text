A COLLEGE NECESSITY

No worse misrortunecould heiali a.
college DY any institution Lhau for it
to find itself without a. common tie
that can hold the interest and enthu—
slash: of all its members in a com-
mon track, working towards a. calm
mon goal.

When we see a college that appar—
enuy lacks pep ind strength, and
seems to be minus the support of its
own students, 01' whose alumni do not
return in large numbers and show in—
tel'est in their alma mater, it is near—
ly always found that no ties or iriend.
Shin and effort have been set Ill) to
keep them together.

Griunell has been particularly for.
tuuata in establishing a reputation
for its “Gl'iuuell Spirit", which is the
personification of all the combined et—
ioits and inﬂuences that draw the
students of crinnell together into one
body, instead of dividing it into
groups with no real object, except
perhaps to outdo the other group.

There are two main ties that Should
be the means 011 unifying the spirit
and interests of aysehool, namely, the
athletic competition in which the col
legs takes part, and the student pulie
licatious. All students have 'a real
part and interest in both of these
sides of School life and Outside activ-
ity, and they both demand the uue
opaliiied support of all.

With these two activities heading

the lisl. students naturally choose une'

which holds the most interest for
them, as their field or outside endemw
or while in college, and because at
the wide differences in the qualilica»
tions ior thc two activities, few pare
ticipatc in hoth iields, which is only
right.
Unlortunatcly,
has arisen, hctwco n the ful~
lowers of these two leading activities,
each group trying to mahc its work
the leading campus activity. During
the last row years this rivalry has

a. friendly rivalry

grown to such proportions that it has

become detrimental to the good of the .

school, rather than helpiul. Many
things, especially the exciting Limes
of the war, helped this along, but
whether it was due to the conflicting
personalities and personal ambitions
of leaders of the groups," or whether
it was merely a good thing carried too
.far, is hard to tell,

Needless to say, with two organi
zations pulling apart, instead a! to-
gether, the college suffers a greater-
injury, and would he less successful
than if it had to try to operate with—
out these influences. Their functions
have ceased to he valuable and hell»
ful. They are dividing the unity that
should exist, they are breaking the
ties that hind the family together,

COlimiG ’1‘0 COLLEGE

The change irom a his at home, to
a life "away at school“, which is he—
ing realized by a large number of
Americans this fall is one oi adjust-
ment and adaptation to new surround—
rugs. Many freshmen will iind liie
in college entirely different from that
which they had pictured. They will
find that their college friends who
have come home and "told them all

about it" have each stressed different >
things, unconsciously giving the pros ’

pective student a rather perverted

idea 0! his new life.

To those who have heard nothing .

but stories about the gay social liie
at college, college may appear rather
disappointing, while those who come
to college with pictures of themselves
sitting up all night every night with
a towel around their heads, studying,
may also suffer some disillusion.
The first thing to learn, when leav-
ing one environment ior another, is
to be able to adopt ones self to the
established customs and
stances of the new liie.
comer to try to reconstruct college
customs and to estahlish new prece-

circum-
For a. ﬂaw

dents. to suit his own ideas, is little
short of suicide, in' the eyes of a body
of critical college students, and where
is there a group so critical of pal-r
sonality and practice Lhan is ~fuund in
college? .
so, lreshiucn, and prospective freshe
men, learn to adapt yourself and apcnd
a few weeks in thought» before you

pass judgment on the present manner ,‘

or running things.

tivo things go together They are equally important.
Emelsou criticizes, with some sharpness, those who give time to
timnl and spend money in it. He says the soul is large or small
wherever it is, and that the man of small soul will not derive beneﬁt
in Atllclls ol‘ Egypt or in the picture galleries of the old world. His
soul always goes With him and interprets life in terms of its own
pacity. Hence it is of vast importance that one should prepare
his soul by education, enlarge it by effort, increase its capacity by
\\ 011: before he makes a journey to foreign lands Else his journey
to foreigm lands will be fruitless. Worseiit will be loss of time and
money. ‘
But whatever may be said about the values of education, it
certainly is tme that the time represented by the college years ought
robe the most important and the most valuable years of oue’s whole
life. They represent an accumulation of capital, large or small, from
which every action in coming life ought to receive inspiration. The
eollege years should be the source of guidance, the source of courage,
the source of inspiration, through all coming years. They are
intended to be the foundation of genuine success in any line of
endeavor whatsoever. The issues of life depend largely upon them.
The most important thing for us to remember about: them is that their
value will depend largely upon the individual effort and purpose.
The right attitude toward education toward opportunity and to hard
work. 'n these college years upon which you are now entering, will.

yc'ils may be, they ought to be, priceless- by your own effort you can
make them so.
