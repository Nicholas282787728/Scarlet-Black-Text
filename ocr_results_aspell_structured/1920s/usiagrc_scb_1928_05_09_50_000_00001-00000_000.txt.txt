Missouri Valley Track Champions
of Iowa. To Be Determined
At Saturday‘s Meet,

LAIRD SHOULD COP JAVELIN

SERIES.

Mark, Barnes, McKee, Taylor Are
Members of Mile Relay Team
Doped To Win.

When Drake, Allies arid dribuell
meet on Ward field Saturday to de—
teruunc the Missouri valley track
chalnpion of lowa, one of the most
colorful meets held in Grinnell in’ re—
celit years should take place. With
such men as Captain Calllum ofAmes,
the last year's Valley half mile chain-
pion, Brunk and Pal-ks of Drake, the
former the indoor Conference high
jump winner and the latter one of the
best sprinters in the Valley and Ta ,_
lor, McKee and Laird, strong track
men from Grinnell, performing; some
exceptional records should he turned
in. ~

One of the featllres of tile day
'should be the llllrdle races when vi
ually the strongest contenders for the
championship in these events in the
Missouri Valley meet the following
week end will compete. Peurluit and
Short. hoth inch who showed well in
the Drake relays two weeks ago, will
represent Drake; Soulte, a sophomore
star, will compete for Antes and Tay-
lor and Long. runners who have place
ed consistently this year will run for
Grinnell. Perhaps the winner of
these events will be the valley title
holder n .-t week.

.uclico lloprd To l"u

Some of the fastest runner. in the
middle west will compete in the cen-
tury and 220 in the triangular meet.
Parks of Drake may he pushed by
Beck who was second in the short
dash at Carleton last week and Pa
letier and LeGore, :lll Pioneer spr t-
ers.

The quarter mile should go to Me-
Kee, a Grinnell runner who was sec-
ond in the Valley outdoor meet a
year ago and third in the indoor meet
this winter. His best races have been
under 50 seconds. He play he pushed
by Caulum. the Ames captain who
mall/«stay out of the half mile in order
to compete in the shorter race, and
Hobbs a Drake runner.

Alncs Strong In Distances

The distance events should go to
Ames with little argument except per-
haps iu the mile where Phillips a
Grim-tell trackster who has run the
distance close to 4:40, runs.

Perhaps the featpre of the day will
he the mile relay; an event in which
Ames beat Crinnell at the indoor tri-
angular meet and Grillnell heat Ames
at the Drake relays. Saturday will be
the meeting which should definitely
settle the relay supremacy in the lows
section of the Valley Mark, Barnes.
McKee and Taylor will probably run
for Grinnell in that order.

Laird Should will.

Perhaps the only field event in
which Grinnell has a definite chance
to win is the iavelin throw, in which
the Pioneers are represented by Laird
whose tosses often are close to 190
feet, ten feet farther than his oppon—
ents usually throw the spear,

There are no outstanding men in
the discus and shot put, The pole
vault should go to Snulte of Ames who
has cleared the bar at thirteen feet.
Greene, Grinnell. should make a strong
bid for second. Brnnk seems to be the
class in the high jump but may he
pushed by McCuily, a Pioneer. who
has cleared the bar at close to six
feet. ,
Taylor, lngrarn, Penqnlt, Soulte and
Parks should fight it out in the broad
jump, there being no outstanding man
competing.

The meet, if the day is good, is ex-
pected to attract one of the largest'
crowds which has ever come to Ward
field to watch a track meet. Besides
a large number from out of town, most
of the student body is expected to at-
tend.

The new Y. W. cabinet entertained
the old cabinet on a picnic at Jones
grove Sunday morning. They Started
at 7 o'clock, some hiking and some
riding, About twenty girls attended.

BAHlElﬂA 'IS WINNER
IA! DUAL THABK AAEEl

Mile Relay Team Easily Defeats
Carleton Quartette; Taylor _
Is High Point Man.

A squad of men capable of winning
seconds and thirds, plus Reay, one of
the strongest dash lnen and lulrdles in
the middle west, defeated Grinnell on
the Carleton field Saturday. Reoy
won both dash events, the century in
10 seconds alld the 220 in 22.i sec-
onds, and the low hurdles and was
second in the high hurdles. The lligll
point man for Griunell was Taylor
who \\'o:t the high hurdles and broad
lump and was second in the low hur-
dies.

Perhaps the two hurdle races were
the prettiest races of the day. in the
120 yard highs Taylor took the lead

from the start and defeated Reay by,

a scant yard, Itcay took a similar-

icto , u the 220 laws when he nosed
out Taylor in the twenty yard sprint
at the finish. -

Laird’sjavelili tosses were the fea-
ture of the field events. one of his
throws, a foot further than the Carlee
ton fieldrecord, was not allowed be-
cause he fouled. Laird also won the
discus event, making hiln the only
mall to win two field events. Cleland
was first in the shot with a put just
short of forty feet.

The surprise of the meet came when
the Pioneer relay team decisively der
teated the team from Carleton which
had won a college section of that race
at the Drake relays. Mal-k took the
lead from the start and was never
headed. McKee, running second, in-
creased tlie lead and Barnes and Tay-
lor running in the last two positions
held the margin.

in a mp and tuck race with East
Des Moincs which the eskaloosa
tracksters finally won largely through
points won in the relays. Oskaloosa
won the [went first annual Grinnell
lntcrscholastic track meet at Ward
lieltl Saturday. New records were esp
tanlished in the numerous events.

Perhaps the most creditable per—
formances of the day were by burns
who, after winning a close second in
the hundred yard dash which was run
in 10 seconds fiat won the 22b in 22
seconds and his heat of the lit in last
time.

Records began to fall in the first
event of the afternoon when Miller,
New English, with Hyllcburg oi Sllone
andoah close on his heels ran the 120
yard high hurdles in 15.2 breaking the
existing mark by two tenths of a sec-
End/Sansen, thc Alta man who won
the iavelin throw at the State meet
last year, created a new mark here
when be tossed the spear better than
170 feet. Second place was given to
a throw of nearly 165 feet.

Loynachan of itnoxwille also made
exceptional records in the field events
when he won the broad jump with
a leap well over 21 feet and tied with
a team mate for first in the ‘high
jump.

One of the feature events of the day
was the mile relay in which Cskaloosa
broke the record which was set last
year by almost two seconds turning in
a time oi 3237.2. Another mile relay
team entered by the same school plac—
ed in the other heat of the race. 05—
kaloosa also won the half mile relay
in fast time.

Perhaps the feature race oi the day
was the 100 yard dash in which Built
of Washington, Burns of Webster City
and. Chase of Roosevelt Des Moines
finished within a, yard with the time of
10 seconds fiat, twostenths of a sec—
ond behind the meet record, 9.8.

Barrett of Des Moiucs was the meet
starter and Senator Charles A. Raul»
son was the honorary referee for the
fourth consecutive time.

Scholarship Competition Is New
' Form of Intercollegiate Rivalry

 

intercollegiate football, basketball,
track, and tennis has been the vague
for years, but now has come an inter—
collegiate competition as an offset to
athletics; scholarship, intercollegiate
competitions in scholar-ship, long the
dream of those who have insisted that
colleges put too great emphasis on
athletic rivalry, will become a‘rcality
under the terms of a one hundred and
twenty—five thousand dollar fund giv—
en Harvard university by Mrs. Wil-
lillm Lowell Putnam of Boston, a Side
ter of President Lowell of Harvard,

The first competition for prizes un-
der it was held on April 30, when ten
Picked students from Harvard and a
similar number from Yale met in a
tnree»houl: English literature test.

Each member of the victorious team
was given five hundred dollars worth
of hooks and a medal and the judges
were three professors from neutral
colleges.

There was simultaneous Harvard-
Yale contests at Cambridge and at
New Haven. The examination was
compiled by two professors each from
Harvard and Yale and one from
Princeton. Names of the competing
teams were not made known until
two days before the contest. This was
rlesigned to prevent ”cramming,”

The income from Mrs. Putnam's
fund will he used to promote a series
of similar competitions in which oth»
or leading American universities and
colleges will loin.
