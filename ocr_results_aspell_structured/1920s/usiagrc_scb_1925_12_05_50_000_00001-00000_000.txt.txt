Three Taurus Are cessdry in Orgler
to Name All Players Worthy of
Honorary Positions.

MARTIN 0N FIRS'D ELEVEN

Wing and Mecter on Second llockr'icld,
Davis and Meyer ou Forward
wall of Third Tcnru.

With the passing of the gridiron
game for another season, it is customr
cry for the Scarlet and Black to sub—
mit nu all-Missouri Valley mythical
eleven. However. because of the
galaxy of stars among the teams of
the Valley, it has been necessary to
pick three all-star aggregations.
There are so many good men to
choose from and there is scarcely any
difference in ability of these players.
In fact in nearly every case a man
picked on the third team could be
substituted on the first without weak-
ening that outfit.

Martin was the only Grinnell player
to receive a place on the first eleven
but on the second team dieetcr and
Wing were both given recognition.
Davis was placed at tackle on the
third team and Moyel- was honor-ed
with a center berth.

Sloan mid nucclrus, Ends

Ted Sloan of Drake and Bacchus of
Missouri are the choice of ends. Last
Year Sloane was placed on the all-
Valley first team and his splendid per—
formances in the games this season
easily won him this honor again.
Though slightly small for an end.
Sloane makes up for his luck of
weight by his terrific speed and his
uncanny prowess in following the
ball. An accurate receiver of the fore.
nrd pass, a good blocker, and a hard
tackler are some of the reasons for
his place on the first team. His great-
est asset is his ability to solve the
attack of the opposition. He is one
of the brainiest players the Valley
has seen for many years.

Bacchus the other wingman, is the
most versatile, all round end in the
Valley. He possesses an ideal build,
his and weighing around 185, making
him a fine defensive player. He is
an excellent catcher of passes under
adverse conditions and also can heave
the ball a good distance. His amazing
speed has made him a constant worry
to opposing kickers and he has block-
ed many punts this year. ,

Missouri has Great Trickle

Termed as one of the greatest tack—
les that ever played at the Tiger insti—
tution, Lindenmeyer of Missouri. is
given one of the mckle positions.
Standing six feet two inches and
weighing 195, fleet and aggressive are
some of the qualities of this powerful
linemen. He is credited with outpla. —
lug Weir in the Nebraskarlvﬁdsourl
game, a feat that is alone worthy of
placing him on the first team.

Ed Weir, Nebraska's famous all-
Amerlcau tackle and captain of the
l-luskcr gridsters for two consecutive
years is given the other tackle poslr
ﬁon. Hampered by so much publicity
this famous leader did not perform as
brilliant this year as last, yet he is
still good enough to deserve a first
team rating. Weir‘s spectacular
speed down the field under punts was
missing this year as he as forced to
do all of his team's punti‘ug. M'Dst
opponents placed two or three men
against this peerless lineman this
fall. He is furthered honored by be<
ing ﬁven the captaincy.

Glnurwls Plentiful

Good guards were plentiful among
the Valley elevens but McGee of the
Kansas Aggies and captain of his
team towers above the rest. To his
weight and size he adds speed and :tg-
grenslveness that makes him a. great
power on offense and defense. He
blocks well and tackles hard and
coupled with his fine playing spirit
makes him at valuable Truth.

Martin of Grinnell wins the other
guard berth. This great llnesman is
one of the best that have been dc.
velopcd in the pioneer institution for
years. This year he was shifted to
tackle but he can play either position
equally well. A hard worker, fierce
tackler and a savage blocker make
Martin one of the finest llnesman in
the Valley. He is able to go down one
der punts almost as fztst as any and
and his shiftincss makes hlra hard to
get out of the way. He is a real

Pioneers Wound Up
By Trouncing Nebraska Eleven

Thirty years ago Grinnell wound up
the football season by trouncing Ne-
braska 24 to 0 on the local field. It
was the close of the 1895 season and
Nebraska had been undefeated during
the year.

The game was different from pres-
ent day football in many ways, as is
revealed by the files of the Scarlet
and Black.

The s. & 13. describes the game as
follows:

“After a great deal of uncertainty
due to the most deplorable condition
of our finances, resulting in large
risks by a few individuals, the game
was finally played. in spite of the
bitter cold weather some 200 enthus-
iasts including not a few ladies, were
on the grounds promptly at three
o'clock to welcome the players . . .
The management had had
enough to prepare a large bonfire.
and it greatly alleviated the discom-
ritur-c of thc weather .

Players on

"Poor Nebraska's confidence was
doomed to an awful shock. Their big,
heavy men were bumped and buffeted
about in a most bewildering manner.
'llank" Brown of Grinncll. and Jones,
the big guard of Nebraska, were chos-
en as referee and umpire, respectiver

Thomas, Nebraska's coach, were to act
as lirrcsmen . , .

Slty Sports “'rltl Most llcc'lmiic
. lul Rmnlcrs Most Critical. Speech
[vii es Practical Advice.

“Tile sport page is the most whole

some page in the newspaper." said
Dean l-Iurr-y F‘. Harrington, director of
the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern University, in his ad-
dress on “Professional Journalism" be—
fore the sixth annual convention of
the Iowa High School press Associfh
tron convened in the Little Theatre of
the quadrangle yesterday afternoon.

He based his conclusion on the fact
that the writers are the most accurate
and the readers are the most critical.
‘ Mr. Harrington adapted his subject
to his high school audience and spoke
of the amateur spirit, training young
reporters. and the composition of a
high scool newspaper staff

"News is nothing but a variation or
the average picture of a man,” he said
later in his speech when he gave the
deﬁnition of what a reporter looks for
and a reader reads.

An apt illustration of attaining suc-
cess in the newspaper field was used
at the beginning of Dean Harrington’s
speech when he read a telegram he
lhad received during the address of the
first speaker, JohrfD, Aue, editor or
the Burlington Hawkeye, from the city
editor of the Waterloo Courier, who,
it seems, had been a student of his
at Northwestern University. This
student had previously given up all
hope of gaining journalistic success
without further training. However,
his work attracted the attention of
the Waterloo editor, and as a result
he is new city editor there.

Amateur spirit as evidenced in
school papers and elsewhere is avalu—
able and important thing in life. it
offers an opportunity for development
and stimulus for enthusiasm. "You
don‘t develop a ‘Red‘ Grange on the
town lotihe learned to be a great.
amateur on thecollege campus." Am-
atellr spirit is often careless but it is
usually beneﬁcial. ’ ' '

Amateur reporters have a number
of careless habits which must be eradi—
cated before they enter the journalistic
profession The most common fault
is hearing incorrectly, especially in
the matter of misspelled names and
wrong identiﬁcations, Papers are be-
coming more telephonic, which makes
correct hearing paramount.

Another thing to be eliminated in
young reporters is seeing incorrectly.
"Very few of you will 'ever see a story
face to face." he continued.

Miss Read will speak at tile Prayer
Service next Sunday morning.

Dill Not Praise Coach
“Nebraska made many friends while
in Gl’illnell by their gentlemanly con-
duct and the Cleanness of their game.
They will be welcome here ftt any
time; but to the credit of their coach,
Mr. Thomas, little can be said.”

Twenty years ago, Griunell wound
up the gridiron season by administer—
ing a. 7570 beating tn Simpaon. Ten
,yefu's ago Cornell fell the v'lctim of
la 13-6 battle in the final game of the
‘year and Grlnllell held the undisputed
title to the conference championship
of IOWla. Tthe same year Grinnell
defeated Iowa 1-0 for the state soccer
ititle.

llilitilr of Burlington Himli o Tolls
Ileilmrs No Success Sticks to
All Eight “our llfty.

"You must work, sacriﬁce, and for
get hours, — I do not know a success
rll life that has stuck to his eight
hours a dity," Said John D. Auc, editor
or the Burlington Hawkeye and presi-
dent of the [own Publishers associa-
tion, in stressing the work element in
his address on “What to Expect of
Workers in the Newspaper Field” be-
fore the 231 delegates to the Iowa.
High School Press Association assem-
bled in the Little Theatre yesterday
afternoon.

Mr. Aue gave an all around survey
of the journalistic ﬁeld for those who
might wish to enter it, including in his
tftlli the executive, editorial, advertis-
lng, circulation, and mechanical sides
of the business. He particularly em-
lJliitslzed its broad scclJe.

No luflucrrcc w lrout Money.

"A newspaper which does not make
money does not wield a great milur
Since," he began in developing the ex-
ecutlvo side. He pointed out that
there is at present no newspaper that
is controlled by those who do not run
it. There are many doors to enter the
newspaper ﬁeld, and in the executive
end there is room 'Kol' managers, credit
men, bookkeepers, and stellogl‘dphera.
It is their duty to keep the paper on
n proﬁtable basis.

”The editorial side is composed of
all those who \v ‘te. In at large paper
it is very specialized. “If I were EL
young man entering the newspaper
ﬁeld, I would do my cllhhlng on a
smaller paper" in order to learn the
adaptable ﬁeld of specialization. Many
editors would have their Writers grads
uate from the advertising department
because the high cost of editorial itc-
cldents. ‘

Advertising In infancy.

"Advertising is Still in its infancy,”
continued Mr. Aue, ru especially recs
ornrnending that phase of newspaper
work to young journalists. There is
one Copy Writer in Chicago who xe—
ceives $50,000 a year because he can
write ads that sell. Advel ’ ill;
Space in some newspapers comes its
high as $15 per inch, and recently ﬁfty
newspapers took in $35,000,000 on ad-
vertising alone. The advertising must
pay for the paper when the Circular
tion fails to do it.

If a. journalist cannot write all copy,
there is it place for him in the circu-
lfttlon department if he can sell. No
other concern has studied the distribu-
tion problem more than the newspaper.
On large dailies, the papers are all
distributed Within itn hour after print-
ing. There is room for at genius here,
he said, and when the genius is found,
the pity is there.
