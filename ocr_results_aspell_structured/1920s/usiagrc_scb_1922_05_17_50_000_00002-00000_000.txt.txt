A NEW lun'iGidiiF

Today the control of the Scarlet and
Black passes from the hands of the
old management into the hands of the
new. As We take up the reins and
enter upon the task that is before us
we pause for a few muments to look
back over the past and to look for—
ward into the future. As has been
said so many .timos, a nwspaper is
greater than its editors—is greater
Lhan its staff. It can not be mndo by
one man but what it is rests with its
entire stair and svith its whole body
of readers. The Scarlet and Black is

an institution, the management of ,
whichV and the determination of whose K

policies has been intrustcd to us for
«a brief year. This year will be very
brief when we consider ‘lt in the light

of the twenty-nine years that the [la-l

pet has been in existence.

In looking back over the past year,

we ﬁnd that,'\lnder tho ahlo nlanzlge~l

men: of Mr. Ashby and Mr. Flynn, the
Scarlet and Black has been a and.
whereby accurate news has been fur-
nished its readers, and thru which
so opportunity has been oiiorod to
any one to express his views on any
subject pertaining to college life. The;

believe to bc’an equally
iunction oi a‘ newspaper. They have
endeavul‘ed thru their editorial col—
umns to promote any movementwhichl
, is in a “greater and better Grinnell,"
and to oppose any >movcment which
does not niaketur the altainmentof
thishighidezil. The policies of the l'etil-
ing editors will not be changed by the,
new managemenL These twa func-
tions, 7the furnishing of occursto
news and the promotion or orcrytlring
good for the college, will he the un-\
derlylng mom-cs of our control of the'
paper during the coming year.

For this reason we do not consider
the going out of the Old and the cams
ing in of the new management as a
period of violent transliion.‘ The pair
lcies Of the paper will remain essen-
tially the The
Black worrld go on just the same with—
out us. Somebody would be iound to:
do the nccsssnry work connected with
its publication. But at the samo time
We realize that whoever is in control
has a doiinltc responsibility, and we
aim to justify the trust that has been
placed in us to the best of our ability.

A year ago, when tho .mpnagcmsnt
which is now retiring ﬁrst entered
upon its task, a "gr-cater and better
Crinncll was sot as the goal to he
reached on tho voyage of the Scarlet
and Black thl'u the year. This is the

same.

goal which is before us, but we must,

also remember that it is a goal which
is constantly moving iorward even as
fast as our journey carries us to-
wards it.
