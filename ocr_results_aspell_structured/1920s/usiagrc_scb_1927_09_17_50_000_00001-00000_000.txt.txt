’ Lack of seasoned material iﬁnoth»

ing new to Coach Watt. In his sopho-

more year, with only three veterans,

the team suffered its only defeat at

the hands of the famous Carleton team

of '16. Last year he built up an un-

defeated team at Roosevelt high, Des

Moines, though he lacked experienced

material. ,

' His system of play '5' built 'on his

confidence of brain over brawn. He

believes in an open attack varied by

enough thrusts through the line to
make this play successful.

Evahu, Davis Nucleus.

What the team does this year will
depend largely on the work of Carr
lain Dav-ls and Ross Evahn, letter men.
The former is a raugy tackle who has
has made a name in Valley circles

. both by his outstanding defensive
work and his consistent play on the
offense. Evahn is a back who adds
to his shifty ball carrying the threat
of his accurate passes.

The sophomore material should not
be underrated. It includes such men
as Rose, McIntyre, Parish, Bradley
and Klinefelter, all of whom show
true varsity ability. Rose is a line
puncher who never knows when he is
stopped and McIntyre is a quarter-
back of the kick, pass, or run variety.
Bradley plays center and guard with
equal ability while Parish is a guard
who does his best work when he
comes out“ the line as interference.
The problem of a tackle to match CnD'
tain Davis seems partially solved, at
least, in Klinefeller, a large man who
plays a cool, hard game,

Pierce lintl Deli . Out.

There are some other second year
men who did not put in an appearance
for freshman football, but who show
strong possibilities as varsity mater~
iai. Carroll Dewey is playing his
first season at center and is learning
that position fast, u-hile Fierce shows
promise as a halfback.

Cleland, a senior who has played his
share in a number of the games the
last two seasons, promises to play the
game of his carcer this fall, in his
favorite position, guard. Kingory and
Brooke are also seasoned men who
may figure this year.

Despite her lack of experienced men
Grinnell faces the hardest schedule in
many years, Nebraska and Wiscon-
sin are newcomcrs on her curd who
will be high lights this season. Mar—
quette, playing her homecoming game
with the Scarlet and Black, is deter-
mined to take full measure for the
trounclng handed her last year. Ames
boasts the best prospects in many
years and counts on breaking the line
of two tic games with a win.

Drflkc Out For Blood.

Drake has not forgotten the defeat
of last year and plans to take the full
“blood atonement" for it. Penn ‘opens

Frosh Have Array
Of Gridiron Stars

New Football Material Has Good
Prep Records In Other
Sporbs Also.

A talented squad of freshmen will
face the varsity in scrimmage this
season. Such men at Letton and Ek-
wall of Des Moines, Humphrey and
Minir of Mollne, Richie of Villsca and
Douglas of Cedar Rapids form an ar-
ray of elf-prep School stars
should make a good grid team for
Grinnell the next few seasons.

Besides being a man who plays
guard,,tackle and end with equal ease,
Ekwall of East high. Des Moines tosses
the twelve pound shot well beyond
fifty feet consistently. His fellow
towosman, a West high product also
plays more than one position well.
Letton is both a guard and a fullback.

The pair from Moline, Miuir and
Humphrey, are llnemen who make slx
footers look small. They play basket-
hall as a side line. Minor of aska—
loosa claims fame both as an elusive
halfback and a quarterrmlle man who
steps the distance well under fiftyrtwo
seconds. Alex of Davenport uses his
ability to step a fast hundred to evade
tacklcrs on the gridiron

Bob Eerguson of Tama and Weitrich
of Stuart are backs who did well in
prep school. Douglas ol'Ceddr Rapids
is a driving halfback. He cleared the
bar for second place in the high jump
at the state prep meet last year.

l-iakendorf of Davenport, lfoger ol'
Newburg and Menson of Centcrville
are promising linemen. Kelley of
Gl'illnell and Postom of Council bluffs
are players leaving fine records be.
liind them. Kelley runs the furlong
and four-forty in fast time.

Sophs and Fresh Will Tangle Soon
In Grand Melee Of Blood and Gore

On some stilly sombre evening in
the not too distant future there will
occur as bloody an encounter as has
been chronicled in the annals of this
journal in many a year. The manner
of shedding the gore is this. One
night the sophomores will be routed
from their beds and given an hour to
leave for straw stacks, deserted
houses, old barns, back alleys and
what have you. There they will rest
peacefully on a rock or fl. hardwood
board until morning.

Meanwhile the angry horde bf fresh-
men will be in hot pursuit, Chasing
this way and that and not knowing
where to go, with cord in their hands
and blood in their eyes. They will at-
temnt to tie up all sophomores who
may come Within their clutches and
hold them prisoners until morning.

 

At iivc o'clock a truce is dcclarcrl
and the sophomores begin to appear
lit the dormituri s from all their nooks
rind cranhi -, the fresh meanwhile
wondering into what thin nil‘ their
toes hull evaporated the night before.
One hour later the whistles blow, the
men square off. s’aphs on one side and
fresh on the other, ready for the big
rush. There is a. pile of struggling
figures; the piles become single cams
bats. single in that one sophomore has
to Stand three newboys; the whistle
blows again and the first year men
reside triumphantly on the torsos of
the apparently vanquished meaner
class.

But then, there is such it thing as
cunning defeating brute Strength, and
the sophomore: have won the majority
of the fights in farmer years.

New Students Hail From Fourteen
States and Two Foreign Countries

Freshmen in the class of 1931 nulii-,
her 308, according to an estimate upr
proximatcd at the administrative of-
fices this morning. This makes the
present freshman class one of the
largest to ci’itcr Grinnell college in
several years. The proportion of men
to women was not ascertained, due to
the rush of registration.

However, it is known that the new
students hail from 115 different iowa

towns, a fairly representative gather--
ng. There are fourteen states rel?-
resented in all. Although the lists
were not carefully checked, students
from the furthest distance away were
thought to be une from China and one
from Ger-many.

When the rush of registration and
getting settled are over accurate figr
urcs will be presented as to the com»
position of the class of 1930.

Two New Mentors
To Direct Sports

Truesdale and Watt, Director and
Football Coach, Both Have
Imposing Records.

TWO new members of the coaching
force at Grinnell are at hand this year
to guide the Pioneer hopes tuwaril suc—
cess. After losing both director of
athletics and football coach lust sea-
son the scbuol authorities immediate-
ley set about the task of filling these
pluces, with the result that. John C.
Tucsdale, former coach at Union high
school, Grand Rupids, Mich, and Les~
ter L. Watt, former director of ath-
letics at Roosevelt high school, Des
Moines, received the appointments of
dlrector, and head coach, respectively,
for the coming season.

'l‘ruesdllle From Carleton.

The new director of athletics, Mr.
Truesdale, was a product of Carleton
college at Northfield, Minn, and
hradley Tech. at Peoria, ill. While
at the Minnesota school he was an
outstanding performer in all branches
of sport, excelling in football and has—
ketball. As a-membgr of the famous
Carleton teams of 1916 and 1917, Mr.
Truesdaie played a large part in his
team's success. Playing tackle on the
great team of '17, which defeated the
University of Chicago, and was un-
disputed conference champion, the
new Grinnell director was une'iniomus—
ly selected as allrconference and all.
state tackle.

0n the basketball court, Mr. Trues-
dale contributed a good deal to thc
Carleton team's high rating in the
middle west, being a high scorcr from
the center position. Although not an
unusually tall man, he had a faculty
of getting the jump on his opponents
and taking the ball rapidly down the
floor. Thcse accomplishments he bus
imparted to all the tcams which he
has coached

:liiulc .\li-Cnuieroucc.

Finishing his college course at iiiad-
ly Tech in Peoria, lll , Trucsdulc pin -
cd tackle on the lsrudlcy team of (18,
being selected by "Brick" Young,
Bloomingtuu sports writer, and a Big
Ten official, as all-ccuforcnce tackle,
His work on the court was cut short
by :1 conference eligibility ruling.

Confiuing ins cinder efforts to inve-
lin throwing, he set a record in Mid-
nesotil circles which withstood the at-
tacks of followi <— stars for several
years. ‘

Trucsdalc was director of athletics
at Union high school, Grand Rapids,
Mich, where his teams acquired the
habit of taking state championships in
both football and basketball with
alarming regularity. Football champs
in 1013, 1922 and 1925, basketball lead-
ers in 1921 and 1922, find several city
championships won from five other
city teams, fell to the Union clan. In
1923 and 1926 his football teams lust
but one game in ton on each schedule.

In 1926 four members of the Univer-
sity of Michigan basketball team were

Freshmen Spend First Few Days
Getting Acquainted And
Having Good Time.

INFORMAL PARTY TONIGHT

Religious Services To Be Attended
Tomorrow; Monday, Tuesday
Programs Are Full.

Freshmen who desire to take part
in student activities other than regu-
lar class work will have many opp-ur-
tullities to do so, this year the same as
in the past. There are numerous or—
ganizations on the campus and most

' of them have room for some first year

students.

Both men and women can partake
in athletics. For the men freshman
football and cross country track work
will give physical training credit, as
well as swimming. The tennis courts
are available for any one and ﬁne
Grinnell Golf Club,‘ which lies a short
distance north of the campus, can be

' joined upon the payment of a. small

sum. Women will have a. variety of
fall sports including golf, tennis, hoc—
key, hiking and gym work.

Debaters, Musicians Needed.

The men will have an opportunity
to take part in public speaking and
debate thwugh the Forensic debating
Society, the intramural Merrill debates
and the Various prize speaking out»
tests. Women will have a formidable
debating squad, of which several were
freshmen last year.

Musically inclined freshmen will have
a great deal of opportunity tn exercise
their talents. Both the Men’s Gleo
club and the\Girls‘ Glee club hold
tryouts and elections shortly after the
beginning of school and generally take
on several freshmen. The college
band and orchestra also welcome
freshmen with ability. Some men make
their music pay by getting jobs on
some of the dance orchestras on the
campus.

Journalism Popular.
“Those who are interested in writing
and journalism have an exceptional
chance to show their ability at Grin-
nell, Besides the freshman English
courses, there is opportunity to get in
print through the columns of the
SCARLET AND BLACK, the MAL.
TEASER, humorous magazine publish.
ed by the Grinnell chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi, and the TANAGER, col-
lege literary magazine. The Writers’
club was organized at Grinnell last
year and included several freshmen.
Actors Welcome.

The Dramatic club and the Experi—
mental Theatre are the means which
freshmen have of displaying their
liieriouic ability. *Thel‘e are
various other 01 gallizations which
take care of it Student's Special inter-
est such as the Science club, the
Mathematics club, the Business club,
he Cerclc Fraucais, which is the
French club and the Cosmopolitan

The Y. )I. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A.
are glad to welcome freshmen who
are interested in their work and their
meetings are always open to fresh-
men. The men's “Y" holds Weekly
ll‘lElCtings throughout the your with
the programs of speeches and music.

Thanx! .

The SCARLET AND BLACK editors
will consider it a favor if freshmen.
or anyone else, will call our attention
to any misspelled names that may an;
pear in our columns find if they will
send or give us a slip with the cor-
rect spelling printed on it.

The college directory will probably
not be published for some time, which
consequently makes it difficult to
print all new students' names correct-
ly the first few weeks. Will you do
that, please?
