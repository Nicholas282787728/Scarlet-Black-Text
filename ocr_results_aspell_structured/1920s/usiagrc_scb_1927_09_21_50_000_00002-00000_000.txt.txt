Business men or a certain type pound a burly iist on
a mahogany desk and shout loudly above the din of a
soap tactoi-y that the college man “is not worth his salt."
His education is of a superﬁcial, idealistic nature: he
laclrs real training, they say. Perhaps they are right.

But the business man might go haclr even iurthcr
than the college, it is quite e. eiitial to attend high
school before entering the portals ot the suicide victims.
He might find out just what his own boy or girl. it he
has any, is learning at home heiorc being sent array to
the halls at higher education. ‘

The trouble mm a great number or college men and
women is that they lack the proper training heiorc they
ever arrive at college, The majority of high schools in
this country are pittully inefficient. They turn out stu»
dents hy the million who haven't the slightest idea ol

One of thc reasons ioi- this is that they do not give

a iillainess. duly- installed by the high gods to inilict
education, useless education, upon his weary mind.
Laincntahly enough we iind that idca among a row col—
lege students, but the proportion is quite small.

This criticism is directed nt-the smaller high schools,
outside or large cities, tor we have noticed a remarkable
diitcrencc in the preparedness for college or the city high
school graduate and tile nominally country high school
strident.

in smaller towns politics and cattiness of school
board members have a great deal to do with this in de-
terinining the personnel oi the high school taculty, col-ls

seqiicntly tile fttcillty sometimes regulates its actions to'

please the board in a manner which does not tend for the
best education of the students.

High schools are also trying to imitate colleges ill the
number and variety of their outside activities for students
rather than laying the stress on the other side,

This criticism is rather dogmatic but we would sug-
gest to the burly soap manulactui-cr that before he coli-
demns the college man’s training he investigate his own
home school.

what we will have to look (or in the future.

A survey or the campus shows a

interest which have been made during
the summer in addition to the routine
work of repairs and renewal which is
always carried on.

First in appeal to the students and
especially to the men is we long-
awaited installation or a telephone

P001 Is Lined.

The swimming pool has been lined
with white cement, donated by-
N. Darling, (Ding), ol the board or
ti-ustecs. other minor improvements
have been made in the pool. The pool
was open for use (luring the summer
until August 15, when it was drained
for the new lining.

Another improvement which will esr
peciolly be noticed by residents of the
quadrangle is the replacement of the
walks on the campus which have
threatened [or some years to fall into
the tunnel.

A iorce of painters was at work on
the buildings nearly all slimmer. A
’great deal of interior wall: was done
in the quadrangle and men’s halls, and
the exterior woodwoi-lr on several
buildings was renewed. The tower

on the Administration building, one of 3.

the landmarhs of the campus for near
ly titty years, was marked for re-
moval on account of its decrepit cons
dltion, but has been spared for the
time being at least, and in its new
coat of white paint it is more attract-
ivc than ever,
\ w Addition to Organ.

A unique addition will soon be made
to the Terril Memorial Organ in Here
rick chapel. While he was at North—
western university teaching this sum—
‘mer Dr. G. Herbert Knight became
acquainted with a wealthy connoisseur
of organs in Chi ’lgu, who has a very
line organ in his home and is always
gc‘xperimenting and malring improves
‘mcnts. As a result Dr. Knight was
presented with a set or organ pipes or
:very recent design, known as “cor
>anglais,” or English horn, a new (lev
veiopment oi the organ stop known
‘as the oboe. This new stop will be
iadded to the thirty—eight stops already
‘in the organ as soon as the attache
'nients can he obtained.
