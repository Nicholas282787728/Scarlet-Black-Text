IOWING “TURN

"A peach of it may about peaches"
correctly describes “Turn to the
Right." . . i It is at bucolic play, hilar-
iously funny, noted competently, and
is of unmeasured delight to the midi--
once. Two crooks find an innocent
suiicrer at the hands or the law bztvo
the leading ports. The innocent buy
hits "done time" as have the two
crooks, and when it is over they all
repair to the country, Where the boy
lives. Hove the Wise men of the dark
nights (we turned loose “port the inno—
cent and unsuspecting country bumps
kins with highly humorous results.
It is it play without pretentious, clev-
erly conceived and acted in the right
spirit. It is at the Colonial.

. THIS WEEK AT "HE STRAND ,
Grinnell, Iowa

Monte Cristo, the big Fox Special
in tan rccls, opened at the Strand last
night to a well filled house, who mar-
veled at the sumptuous costumes and
the attention to detail. The story by
Alexander Dumas is faithfully follow-
ed and makes a fascinating romance
that rivals anything that the screen
has ever given.

This week and also comes a pic-
turc that has been pronounced per-
iect tor its kind; a picture that dif-
tars from Monte Cristo in every res<
pect, founded upon Lincoln J. Carter's
”The Fast Mail." No picture ever
presented crowds into the space or e
reels the action that "The Fast Mall"
does.

The thrills include a racing train
with a daring leap, a steam boat
race on the Mississippi, a thrilling
steeple chase, a great nrc scene and
rescue and an automobile chase that
is just about the climax,of motion
picyure realism. The cast includes
Buck Jones and Eileen Percy and it
is a picture that you cannot afford to
miss if you like thrills, action and a
good story.
