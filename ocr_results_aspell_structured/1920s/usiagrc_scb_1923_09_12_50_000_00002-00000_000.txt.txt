Grinneu college begins its seventy-
seventh year today. its span has wit—
nessed the winning or the West, the
development or our own state lroni its
infancy, and the period of greatest
material advancement that the race
has enjoyed.

Tallaw dip to Mazda, log nut to Sky
scraper, prairie schooner to a trans-
continental highway in the clouds,
the metamorphis of our state mm a
pioneer community into a rich agri-
cultural commonwealth sown with
thriving cities or progressive people
—ou this has been witnessed by the
rugged walls or 01d Grinnsll.

The much or events has not swept
past our college. it, too, has under—
gone a. wonderlui development in the
Bambi-seven yeu‘s or its existence.
Starting with s iaoulty oi one, a home
missionary who devoted but part at
his time to teaching. it has added to
its stair at the state or one member tor
every year at its existence. starunsl
with a small, one-story building thav'
housed everything "from the museum
to the astronomy class." surviving tire
and cyclone, Grinnsll has built twen—
,ty»iive buildings on a campus iamous
throughout the state for its beauty.

That. amks only of its material hls-‘

tory. High standards of scholarship
and a genuine Christian spirit were
the two objectives upmost in the
hearts ot its founders.
jecn‘ves, once attained, have been the
most cherished possessions oi those
who hold the Grinnell Spirit in trust

We desire, however. to avoid such

ot meaningless prophesies, we would
like to point out a very low salient

mining thc success oi the iootbail
season that is just opening.

in the iirst place, there s the coach.
in the unsettled years that iclloucd
the war Grinnell had a rapid tire sue»
cession oi coaches. Such a thing may
he unavoidoble, but it is unfortunate.
It takes time ior any coach to train
his system at playing into a team, and
(sequent changes of system are bound
to slow up the development ot a root—
bcll machine.

This year Coach Elward enters up-
on his second year at Gl'innell. He
has already instilled his style cl play
linto the Fionearkthat's a good start.
it is not necessary to say thll'. he has
demonstrated his understanding oi the
lioutbsll art—that’s the business of
'every good coach and may he tnhen

mentor. We will not say that he
knows (netball for he lives football.

What ls more significant is U at he
has proven-his ability to handle his
men. or almost equal importance is
the tact that he has already earned
the respect and trust of the student
body. Linking these tactors together,
we believe that the omens are autpic

If that is Correct, this is the year

——for there has been a complete turn—
over at _the student body since that
time, the laxnesst of attitude has been
gradually lost, and the revival of the
Grihnell spirit a! olden days has been
realized by the slow but irresistible
power oi time.
