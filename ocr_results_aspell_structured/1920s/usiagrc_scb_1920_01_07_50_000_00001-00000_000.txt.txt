The Quakers' Weak teamwork coun-
led with the close guarding of the
Grinnell ﬁve, gave Penn few chances
at the basket, all of their shots being
made from a long range. Although

the Pioneers showed lack of experi-
ence, their teamwork in spots was ex-
cellent, most of their chances at the
basket coming after the bail had been
worked down the floor.

Both teams made their ﬁrst points
on fouls, the Penn tally being their
lone marker for the drst half. Evans
secured the ﬁrst ﬁeld basket and gave
Crinnell a 3 to 1 lead as a result of
splendid Pioneer teamwork, Was-
senar and Vinsel also secured oeld
goals before the half ended, while
Evens chalked up his second marker.
Wasseuar's counter was of the sensa-
tional variety, being made from the
center of the floor. The score at
half—time was 11 to 1.

Penn Scores in Second Half.

Penn scored silt points in the second
half as a result of long shots by
Wright and Force, Wright teasing in
two from long range. Two foul throws
out of live attempts by Wright brought
the Quaker total to 9 points. Fre—
quent substitutions in e Pioneer
lineup by Coach Carl Compton slowed
up the teamwork, but tailed to keep
down the Grinnell score. Before the
end of the game, every man on the
Grinnell squad appeared in the linup.

For Grinnell, Evans and snoesmith
starred on the offensive. while the
guarding ot Captain Winter and Wes-
senar forced the Penn quintet to try
shots from long range. Wright
showed up best for Penn college with
two sensational held goals, while
Feree featured what little teamwork
the Quakers displayed. The basket
shooting of both teams was ragged,
many of the shots falling short of the
goal.
