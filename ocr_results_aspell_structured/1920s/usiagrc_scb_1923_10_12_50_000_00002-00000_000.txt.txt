UNIQUE DANCE FIGURE IN “ENEM-
IJES 0F “'OlLEN."

A mysterious tall figure, swinging
and swaying on a raised platform in
the center of the unique Greek dance
in “Enemies of Women." Cosmopol-
itnn’s magnificent picturization of
Vicente Elasco Ibaucz's romantic novel]
coming to the Strand Theatre
next week, occasions great curiosity’
on the part of every audience which
sees it. The figure appears in the
first of many exotic episodes in the
film, wherein Prince Michael Luhim-
off, the leading character. is impor-
sonated by Lionel Barrymore.

In Ibitnez's story there is mention
at a rare and ancient dance perform-
ed for Prince Lubiinofi. Eight
girls and a solo dancer, Hsnnelore,
perform a dance rite in the film
that is certainly all that the ituth»
or might have visualized, The fig-
ure on the circular dais represents
,the spirit of the Greek dance before
music wils used, according to Ur-
ban. He is the conductor, the Syuu
bol. Dressed in a queer full-length
robe, with a huge mask-face, the fia-
ure wears shoes built with stilts-
heels. In each heal is a hollow
niche holding a small bell. The Palm
ticular task of this figure was to set
the tempo and spirit of the dance
by the tinkling of those bells in his
heels. Widerswlnging arm, too, urge,

according to Urban, string in-
struments were added to the cere-
mony. In “Enemies oi Women" at
harp ensemble of six pieces supplies
this music.

“THE BAT" AT THE COLONIAL—
00‘1‘. 17TH.

”The But," by Mary Roberts Rine-
hart and Avery Hopwood, which
Wagenhals and Kcmper will present
at the Colonial theatre on Wednes—
day night, 0ct. 17th»is the greatest
play of its kind and, there are plenty
of theatrical men who will tell you
that is is quite likely to prove the
greatest play of its kind ever pro-
duced.

The nest proor to offer or the seein-
ingly wild statements. are the facts.

“The Bat" ran for more than two
years in New York. It ran for more
than a year in Chicago. The play
holds the long-run record in Boston
and Philadelphia. ltwas the first
and only play ever to run tor four
consecutive weeks in Baltimore and
has since returned on two different
occasions for additional engagements.

More than 6,000,000 persons have
seen “The last" in the United States
