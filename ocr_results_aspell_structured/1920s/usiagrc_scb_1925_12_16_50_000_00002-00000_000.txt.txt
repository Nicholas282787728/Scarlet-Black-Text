COLLEGE — THE RIYAL OF THE
COUNTRY SHORE GUODS BOX.
The average Grinnell student is ac.

cused of being a time waster who does

a small amount of work.

The worst thing about the accuser
tion is that it is true, Many oi the
students here could pass two liberal
arts courses in the time that—they
waste, There seems to he a conspir-
acy against scholarship. The students
do not study, because they do not ﬁnd
it pleasant, and because it is not
necessary since the instructors offer
“pipe" courses.

Grinnell is not the only college to
blame. Judging from student comp
merits nearly every western liberal
arts college offers nothing 'but a [our
years loaf. Scholastic records show
that Grinuell is one of the better col-
leges but that is not a. compliment,
since no etfort is required to become
it bachelor of hits in any of our West—
Hard labor is not a.
prerequisite to a diploma. in fact the
person who deliberately tries for an
“Getting
by" as easily as possible is the con-
ventional and accepted college attir
tude to take toward studies. It is
taught to freshmen as soon as they ar-

ern institutions.

“A" "is a subject for scorn.

rive‘on the campus,

Students are at fault 'becanse they
dread and shun the drudgery which a
comprehensive course of study de.
mands. The taculty is open to cell—
sure because its teaching methods are
not stimulating. Its spoon feeding
policy of instruction makes thought
unnecessary and often undesirable.

The entire system of college educu~
tiou needs attention, As a local rem-
edy the Scarlet and Black suggests
two things: ﬁrst, a restriction oi par-
ticipation in outside activities; second,
a tactilty investigation or teaching,
methods with the view of making stu-
dents do a larger amount oi more.

THOSE TERRIBLE RUSSMNS.

Russia has just ﬁnished celebrating
the eighth anniversary of soviet rule.
In spite or the horror ,0: virtuous'
American politicians she seems to be
as well and happy as could ’be expec-
ted.

It should be remembered that the,
United States has never recognized‘
Soviet Russia. After eight years in
which Sovietism has apparently be.
come ﬁrmly established, there is not,
yet a sign that the United States is gor
ing to ofﬁcially attempt it.

How many years should a govern—
ment exist before we recognize it.
The United States while still an uur
tried concern received almost lmme-'
diate notice but apparently she doesI
not wish to follow the precedent that
was set for her. Is it not strange that;
this country which has prided itselt.
should;
show no disposition to be tolerant_

upon its liberal principles,
when the other fellow’s political ideas'
happen to be at variance with “good
old U. S. A. politics?"

The Soviets are getting stronger in.
stead of weaker. They are instituting

and are furnishing Russia

 

reforms

with a. capable, etticicnt government,
Many feel that ii the United States
rails to ignore the Soviets she will set
herself up as a good example or preju.‘
dice, lnwierazlce and obetinacy.

While Congress discusses the world

court and America's participation in
inte‘rnntioual nttairs, she might proﬁt-
ably consider the question at Russian
recognition.

To the Senior Class:

How wonderful the Christmas Spir-
itl My worry and loss of weight are
at an end. As the long lost daughter
saves the heavily mortgaged farm, as
the extra examination saves the athe-
lete and thereby the honor or the
school, as the league board saves our
naughty girls from going to the bow-
wows, so your valuable and helpful
present saves me from worry and in—
somnia. Allah be praised: No longer
will 1 murder sleep, “the innocent
sleep, sore labour's bath, the chiel
nourisher of life's rcmst!" My worry
has been what to do in case both my
suspenders and belt broke. Now I
can rest assured that at no time all
three—suspenders, belt and safety-

'pins will break.

I live now only to praise you and to
pay my class dues.
