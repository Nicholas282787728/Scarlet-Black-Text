THE SI’IRI" or A COLLEGE
one of the most important posses
sions or any kind or an institution,
whether a college institution or
business institution, is that intangible
thing best known as spirit. This
‘spll’it’, or which college students talk
so much, is a hard thing to define,
but still, we are often asked to define
it. During the recent endowment
campaign, workers were often asked
to explain that widely known thing
called ‘Gl‘innell Sp‘ Faced with
this question they hardly knew what
to answer. Sometimes they could not
even find tangible examples with
which to demonstrate their point.
Perhaps the most common inter--
pretation of spirit, is enthusiasm and
loyalty, combined with constructive
effort and competition. Spirit is that
which draws memhers or an organized
hody mgether. lit inspires loyalty.
The Grinch Spirit has long stood
as the driving force of the student
body. With the new plan that is fast
coming to be known as the Grinuell
Plan, namely the organization of col-
lege life into three pai-tssthe men's
lite, the women's lite, and the coedue

a

cational life, a slight readjustment is
necessary. The Spi 't 01 the colege
is now to he made up of the combined
spirit of these factions of the school
which make up the whole, A. building
spirit is being slowly but surely de»
veloped, which will draw the men of
each building together in a maternal
spirit oi: helpfulness and of college
loyalty. Each huilding stands ready
to outdo the neighbor buildings in
pushing the college spirit and activ—
ities to the top notch.

The spirit in college and universr
ties differs according to the internal
organia’ation of the life at the various
institutions In very large schools
the student hody is too large to make
a single unified spirit possible. The
smaller organizations push the school
units, and these units make up the
spirit or the university Each lratcre
any or other organization tries in
outdo its liials in getting the largcsl
representation of its numbers to root—
hall games and college lilnclioils.
Each tries to ourycll tlic other,

ln some colleges the class spirit is
the driwng three of the college. chore
lnies are tightly-drawn, and the soil»
iois resent \613' much 'uly irristake on
the part of undcrolassuicn as to then
classification.

The liteiai-y societies, the clubs, and
the members or different activities,
all unite to push all college promo-
tiuns, The type of organization
makes little difference. Whether it
he the class or the society or the
hoarding club, the idea is the same—
each body has its indi idual charac—
teristics, eiwh has a spirit that brings
its members together, and each is
united in the effort to support the
parent institution,

the past three years the development

watched with interest by hoth local'
and outside educators. Each building
should develop its traditions and its
own individuality. At least two of
the buildings have been successful iri'
this already. The period of experi-
ment is over, and the foundation is
laid.

every year it is difficult for buildings

down to incoming students. Men
should be urged to choose the build—
ing at the end or their freshman year,
in which they wish to live during the
rest of their course. Although the
Scarlet and Black believes that cloc-'
tive buildings would work If there
were more of them, all men can not
be included by this system now, and
it would not prove practical. A cer-
tain iininiier of lreshinen should be
assigned to each building, so that the
ﬁéshmen would be about evenly di-
vided.

Graduating memhers of build gs

that they were members of Lniignn

house they lived in, a great help
would he the immediate naming of the
huildings and cottages.
