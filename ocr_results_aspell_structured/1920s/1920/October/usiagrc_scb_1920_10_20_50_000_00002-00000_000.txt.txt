President Mam issued a challenge
to the men Of the college in his talk
to them llondzty afternoon, when he
asked them Why they did not eat at
the dormitory dining room. Although
it was only touched upon my 2, mo-
ment, and was a very minor point ll!
his speech, it is Well hnown that he
has speht much thought and time on
the subject, and feels
about it,

The challenge of the speech was‘
when he asked m6“ either to that at!
the dorms, or to inform the manager
ment, or himself, the reason for cat—

veiy deeply

ing at downtown cafes in preference
to the college.

The Scarlet and Black hopes that
readers filll bc charitable enough to
believe that its position on this subs
ject is not aimed to their patronage
from downtown cafes, but to direct

college patronage where it is intend-‘
rSunday date proposition was rrtc over

on to be, and where it must be it tbei
college is to a. success. Without the
college here; the patronage of collcgol
students could not he had anyway, and .
to maintain tho college it is necessary
that students support it,

In the past the management of the
dorm dining service has given evict
dence of a desire to do anything reas-‘
enable to model the service to Suit
the wishes of the greatest number of:
iner‘r. At some expense it has changed‘
the service this year to the regular-
care plate service, with prices at ex—
actly the same level ,With those pre-
vailing downtown, and with meals
modeled attcr those offered by cafes

, with'which it has to compete. l

At present the dormitory cafe is

serving only 240 meals a day. There

{it to the college.

is no reason why 240 men coul9 be
served at every meal, instead of every
day. Because of the small patronage,
it has hcen necessary to dischargc at
least six waiters during the past weclr,
who dopcud rrpon \l’otli Lo keep them
in school. Unlcss the patronage in-
creases, the dining room will have to
be closed, according to the manage-
ment, which will result in the whole
forcc being out of worth

The main question, however is not
one merely of neural ooinporotive
prices and service with other cafes,
tho management has outdouc itself to
meet the demands of thc diners, and
much study has been put on the situzn
tion. it still offers, as did President
Main on Monday, to try to make any
change which the men think would
be of advantage to the patrons, if the
men will only make the suggestions
publicly,

The money is sorely needed. The
whole college is a co-opcrativc instic
tntion. Without the assistance of the
students, there can be no college, and
without a college therc can be no
students. In future years present
generations of students will be called
upon. as alumni, to help the college
in its problems, both financial and
otherwise. Why» not help now? As
long as the same amount of money
is being spent for meals, why not give

ey than someone else less interested
in you, and in whom you are male in-
tel‘ested?

Do not be bashful.
Main what can be done to make the
dorm service suit the needs.

A short time ago discussion or the

the entire campus, and from the num-
lici- of inquirics received by the Scary
lot and Bloch, it is clear that many
students ore anxious to ”See some
thing happen". One "anxious one"
asked, "Alen'l. you going to do any-
thing about the‘ Sunday date ques—
tion?” othcis pot the some question,
saying thitl. now is the time to “clear
the school of that hindrance to its
good name”.

The Sunday date question is only
onc’of the many movements on the
campus that seem to die bccausc of

lack of the plopcl‘ initiative on the

'part of some group or some organiza-

tion to push them through. It is
quite evident that student opinion

favors the Sunday date. but where is

WALDO GELVIN, ex-’23 ‘

The sudden and untimely death of
Waldo Gclvin, ex—‘ZB, of Marshalltown,
has cost a. gloom of deep sorrow over
the entire campus, Following so
closely upon the death of Kenneth
Graham, of the samc class, the blow
has been a. great one.

Gelvul numbered his friends by the,
whole school. His straightlorward.
