"IIE UNRELIABLES.

(Ohio state Lantern)
"Sure, I'll be there." says the meme
her or an organization, in response
to the rcnrinder of the date and hour
of a meeting to be held in the near
future. The time comes around, some
of those who should be present a we,
but always there are some who fail
to make good their promises.

Various causes may be taken as be-
ing the root of this railing. Carc-
lessncss, disinterest and other busi-
ness are nearly always the reasons. or
these. only the last is a legitimate
excuse, and rrecuently is not a strong
cnc, because the criicierit manager a
ranges his duties with the least pus»
sible conﬂict.

The ﬁrst two may be summcd up
in unreliability. The man who res
peatcdly rails to meet his engagements
will be branded as not being depend-
able. The demand for ‘ 5 services, 7 s
membership and his fruitless coopera-
tion will gradually fade away. No
crrc will call upon him tor anything.

From the college community this
tendency to disregard engagements
and its attendant lack of conﬁdence
from a man's associates spreads into
tbc business world. Once it is earned,
a man ha a hard time ridding hlmr
'elf oi the reputation cl unreliability.
