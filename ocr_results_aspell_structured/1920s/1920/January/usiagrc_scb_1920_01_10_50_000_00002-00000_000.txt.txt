While we are listening to pleas ior

would be well {or us to remember that

A shortage oi teachers has been a
growing reality for the past several
years. Conditions hav’e now reached
an almost desperate stage. Read the
{allowing statement made by the chief
public school Officials from nine east-
ern states:

“The public schools oi the nation
are facing a critical situation. In the
states of. the Atlantic seaboard hune
drcds oi schools are closed because
teachers are not available.

“There are employed ns teachers
many who are not qualiﬁed.

“A loss of students in the state nor-
mal schools amounting to 25, so and
in some states 50 per cent, indicates
that young persons are turning their
attention to other occupations than
teaching.”

There is little question that the com-
pni-atively low salaries paid in the
teaching profession are responsible in
great part for the present shortage.

The training‘required to prepare a

high school or college instructor rep-
resents an investment of several thou-
sand dollars. For, although salaries
have remained approximately station-
ary the standards have been steadily
raised.
‘ 'lt is only reasonable that a man or
woman Who has made this heavy ins
restment in education should desire
to get a iair return.

An investigation in the Des Muines
public schools given out Friday pre-
sents statistics which show that While
a reasonable salary, based on present
prices, should be approximately $1400
a year the average being paid was
$1100. /

inevitable and raise the salaries of
her teachers.

What Do You Think

whether the magazine now studied in

publication for this purpose.
