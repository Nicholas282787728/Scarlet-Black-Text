1 Went to a party

With a. girl

The Dlher day,

And she was very offended
Because I smoked in her pres-
ence

During intermission.

And not ﬁve minutes later

She turned her back to me

And pulled out a powder puff

And patted hoi- fuels with it and

Put it back.

Arltl I thought to myself,

'What i! ztll the young men

Carrier] razors to the next

All-College party

And scraped their faces

Between dantes

In search of any

BOLD WHI—SKER

Which had—rustle its Appearance
Since they—felt the barber?

This little Lady

Said that smoking cigar-em

Is not the mark of a

HEALTHY MAN,

And Shamefaccdly I must admit

A small degree of truth

In the statement

But likewise, In these daysr

You can't always tell a
HEALTHY ‘WOMAN

By her ROSY cheeks.

Sir:

As to these fur-lined monstrositles
which have been adorning the feet of
some of the Restless Sex of late.
Someone had the Crust to say they're
not bedroom slippers, hut fursllned
moccasins.

Of course they're not! How per-
fectly silly! They extend only about
as high as she's instep to allow venti-
latlan on one's ankles. They’ ﬁt
loosely around the top to allow wintry
snows to sift in. indiztns were snv-
ztges, but they knew enough to build

SLIPPER: (1) One that slips; (2) A
kind of light shoe, easily slipped on
or off; (a) A kind of wagon brake
or shoe.
