theMaster Force in Manufacturing

THE marvels of electricity have revolutionized our manu-
facturing industries. With belts and pulleys replaced
by electric motors operating automatic—almost human—
machines. many a slow and tedious process has been elimi-
nated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made
pleasant by his command of this magic power.

The Crane Company‘s plant at Chicago—electrical through-
out—is a model of industrial efﬁciency. lts |0.000 horse-
power of driving energy is brought by three small wires
from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the
machinery which handles the cool for beating. culs the steel,
sifts the sane] and sorts the material~in fact Cloes everything
from scrubbing the ﬂoor to winding the clock.

Such an institution is marvelous—superhumsn—made thus
by the man-multiplying force of electricity. The General
Electric Company has been instrumental in reflecting this
evolution. First, by developing successful electric gene!»
rating and transmission apparatus to furnish economically
this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years
of active Co-operalion with hundreds of manufacturers. it
has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical enelgy
to a multitude of needs. And ﬁnally, through branch
offices and other distributing channels, its products are
made accessible to all.
