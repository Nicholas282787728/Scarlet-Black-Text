GUMMINS BILL FIGHT

Marsh, ’79, Presides
Recent Meeting of Iowa
Farmers.

Bebj. at

(Special to the Scarlet and Black)

Des liloincs, .inn. is (Delayed)—
henjamin C. Marsh, secretary of the
Farmei's’ National Council, Washing-
ton, D. C., and a graduate of Crinncil
College, class of 1838, presided at a
conference of 45 representatives of
Iowa farmers, union laborers and rail-
road brother-hoods, here last night.

The Cummins railroad bill was the
chief object of amok, and Marsh den
clared it meant a Wall Street loot to
the extent 0! $250,000,000 which the
Iarmers would have to pay in in-
creased freight rates. The confer»
ence, which claimed to represent 70
per cent of the voters of Iowa. passed
resolutions asking all lows represent-
atives in Congress to help defeat the
Cummins bill, and to pass legislation
continuing government operation of
the railroads for two more years.

The Kenyon bill regulating the pack-
ing industry was endorsed by the con—
terencc.

Ten representatives of the confer--
ence leit today for Washington to help
defeat the Cummins bill. Fred Can-
ﬁeld, Cedar Rapids, president of the
state Federation of Labor, headed the
delegation.

“Cummins is a trustee of my college
and I have the greatest respect for
him personally, but I'm doing all in my
power to defeat his railroad hill,"
Marsh said.

iiarsh is organizing states thruout
the country to light the bill, Most oi
the eastern states already have organ-

, izaions, and Marsh goes lroru here to

Minnesota and Nebraska.

Glenn E. Plumb, author 0! the
Plumb plan of railroad operation, also
spoke at the meeting

NOYES CHOSEN TO
LEAD CHEMISTS

Grinnell Grad of ’79 I’resident of
American Chemists.

Prolessor W. A. Noyes, ’79, head of
the Chemistry department at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, has been elected
president of the American Chemical
Society,foi~ the second time within the
last few years, The method of elec-
tion is peculiarly free from politics
and it is a true democratic election
in every sense of the word, so the
honor is a good indication of the place
Prof. Noyes occupies in the chemical
world.

Professor Noycs has been head of
the Chemistry department at Illinois
since 1907. He is a. member of the
National Academy of Science and a
Fellow or the American Academy or
Arts and Sciences. He received the

on the atomic weight of chlorine.

Albert Noyes, '19, his son, is now
studying in the Sarhonnc, Paris, and
expects to receive his doctor’s degree

ANATllilA COLLEGE
STARTS WﬂRK AGAIN

In Immediate Need of Teachers
Writes President White to
Dr. Main.

Ccorgc E. White, ’32, who has been
engaged in missionary work in Turkey
ior almost all years, and who is head
or Anatolia Collcgc, Marsovan. in thc
lprovince ol Anatolia, Turkey, has Writ—
ten the iollowing letter to President
Main. It tells oi the hardships being
encountered in a land recently devas-
tated by war.

"I am scnding you herewith a copy
’0! a picture uken on our athletic
|grounds this week. As I wrote you
some weeks ago, the name "Gl‘innell
Field" has been given to those grounds
because of the interest shown by Crin-
hell and the College through various
persons and many gifts, larger or
smaller, for Anatolia College and the
work centering in Marsovan.

Tractor Arrives.

"Last Saturday an A. C. R. N. E.
:tractor arrived from Samscun and on
Monday it hogan work. Its ﬁrst midi
‘experimental you was (lone in our Ath-
‘lelic Ficld whcre resurfacing and some 1
grading were necessary in order to_
mm the ground into shape for our stir
Idents to use again. As you are Welli
laware, tor moi-c than three years, and
|lor practically tour summer seasons
the ground was occupied by the Turks.
The Trail and even the track were
sowed to barley this year. As the
crop was off, however. at about thc
time that the College rcopcncd, we re-
covered the use of our athletic grounds,
lTlle resurracing of the track was done
partly by the students. The picture
shows not only the tractor working
in the oral with its A. C. R. N. E.
driver, but a group of students hurtling
the motor. stonc roller, with which
they are smoothing the quarter-mile
track. That stone, by the way. was
_cut in our own quarry about a mile
away by our own workmen.

irold Grudurtion.

"We reopened college on the ﬁrst
day or October. Our grounds and
buildings are far from completely ren-
ovated, but enough has been done to
make a beginning of college life and
work, only I must hasten to add that
all of the 150 students who have come
in, are in the preparatory classes.
Upper class students have been so
scattered during the war and so many
have lost their livcs, that we resume
teaching without any proper college
Work. Other students, however, may
come back litter: and in this Connec-
iion I might add that (he very- ﬁrst
academic exercise We,lldd aitcr our
wo was interrupted by war, was a
College Commencement, tor in Sep-
tember we held a graduation exercise
and presented his diploma to one
young man who was within a tow
weeks of graduating in 1916,

are largely occupied per force for the‘
time being with service in the cause.
of relief. There are 300 orphans onl
our premises, about halt and half boys
and girls; and these, with students of
the Girls’ School and the College, bring
about one young persons into the life
and under the instruction of our
Amcrican group here. Our College
teaching is well carried for the pres—
ent by a group of five Greeks, three
Armenians, one Russian, and one
Turk, with other teachers in the other
departments. But we need reinforce-,
ments all along the line as soon as we
can get them. of course until peace‘
is signed and political conditions set—
tied down, everything is uncertain and
people at a distance hesitate to come. ’
We cannot get any Armenian to come
to Marsovan from outside. i
”We hope to manage the situation
for the time, but shall greatly need
additional strength to help out before
our work grows to such proportions,‘
and our strength gives way so that we
fail really to meet the situation, The‘
time of supreme need for the servicel
of our wide constituency is right now. ‘
“Sincerely yours,

(Signed) "GEORGE E. WHITE.”
