A successful Recreational i-iour was
held at the Quadrangle, Friday night.

the corresponding buildings as guests.
Each crowd planned a stunt which
was staged in the "Little Theater,"
greatly to the amusement of the "gen-
eral public."

The impromptu program was opened
with an act by the "Yap-Hank Min-
strels.” Then came a cinema “trag-
edy” with Central and Somers and
their guests, as the producers. Cot-
tage i1 gave a takeroft on the Wo~
men’s League Board and enacted a
number of penalties. much to the de-
light at me audience. Cottage and
Building in lent an air or distinction
to the performance. and invited those
present to witness a "beautitul mar—
riage" ceremony. Cottage Iv. with
the aid of Building IV. presented a
‘Long and Short” oiiartette. and Pvn
Muangman in a Siamese stunt. A
Matrimonial Bureau was the scene of
Cottage and Building V’s stunt. Build-
'ng vi "got religion" and gave a regr
lular revival meeting for the heneht or
any orring ones. The Metro Jazz
Orchestra. turnished music thruout the
evening.
