ty of Wisnnnsip and prominent jour-
nalistic text~booir author. Mr. Bleyer
has been associated with damage cdi»
tors for the past twentyreight yenrs,
ﬁrst as a. reporter, then as editor, and
ﬁnally as professor and author. He
discussed a suggestion nude for a Na-
tional College Press Association arid
urged the matter strongly.

"Individualism ls zt great thing, but
it cannot take the place of collective
action. There is, now, no standard of
admission to the journalistic protes-
sion. The connecting linlx between a
paper and the public is the reporter.
Reporting must be made a profession,
not a stepping stone he Said.

w. Earl Hall, assistant news editor

former Illesident of the association,
spoke on the subject, "Out In The
Wol 1d " "College Journalism Applied"
was the topic of the talk given by F
M. Russell, former president of the
lows College Press Association for
1320, now with the Daily Drovers Jou-
rnal-stockmail or Omaha.
Kennedy New President.

W. W. Waymack, managing editor
or the Des Moines Register talked on
“The Managing Editor." “Every pa-
per.” said Mr, Waymack. "must have a.
deﬁnite policy. This may be one of
neutrality or one of partisanship. The
managing editor is largely responsible
for this and for his organization,
which is composed of subordinate edi—
tohswho in turn direct the reporters.
The reporter is the unit or newspa-
per organization. He must have backs
ground and ideal. . Thus college grad
nutes are given preference in join-mi»
lism. fol' they generally have these
Qualiﬁes."

A business meeting was held imme—
diately following the program. At this

'time, an elecﬁnn of ofﬁcers was held
