What is the proper attitude for an
undergraduate to take toward his
college? First should it he one of una
questioning faulty?

We think not. Every thinking Etn-

slnall people.

It is cowardice in its

dent will knoW that his college is not -

perfect and will not worship it as
such. He knows that there is always
room for progress and improvement.
It is his duty as a. loyal Student to
help to improve his college. Honest
criticism on the part of students is
not a. thing to be discouraged.

At the other extreme is the attitude
of the knocker- which no one will sup-
port. Professor L. P, Sherman said
in a chapel speech some time ago: “If
You don’t believe Grinnell is the best
school going, if you are not loyal to
her past and conﬁdent of her future
then You don’t belong herei“

Perhaps Professor Sherman is B. llt— ,

tie ev‘treme to satisfy some but his

point that a worthy student should
have a steadfast heiiet in his college
can he accepted by all.

The conclusion is that the ideal stur
dent is the one who respects and hone
his his institution at the same time
realizing that he has a part to play
in improving where improvement is

The college as composed of the stu- ,

tori-us a closed tamiiy circle and
should he considered as such by all
incrnhers. There are some things ins:

ily which are not spoken of outside of
the tamiiy. There are difficulties ofv
everyday life which must he settled
within the four walls of the home and

The Associated Press in a recent dis-

patch quotes the Vorwaerts, a. leading

 

German publication, in regard to the
recent French aggression as iollows: ;

“France is in the thrall of chau»
vinisnt and militarism, which, as Ger-‘
niany's late has shown, leads nations
inevitably to perdition. It is essential
that Germany seek to live in agree-3
merit with her neighbors, and it is the
tluty of French socialists to see that
the ground for this understanding he
prepared An international crisis can,
be avoided only by the league of heel
Lions becoming a reality and taking at
hand in the solution.”

The important part of the quotation

is that dealing with the recognition by
Germany of the fact that the path
which she has trod does lead "to per—
dition" and that "it is essential that‘
she seek to live in agreement with her ‘
neighbors," If this is more than
diplomatic cant and represents the
true View of the German people the
outlook tor a world at peace is greatly
brightened '
