COME YE SONS OF OLD Gliml'I-ILL

Since about at year ago, when the
first announcement of the drive for
the increased endowment fund was
made, students‘have been awarg that
some sort of a'crisis was facing the
éo'l‘lege. Just how great the need for

guess .and although
that it was great, many took the rats

After the senior dinner last night.
seniors came away thoroughly con-
vrnced or the dire ncccssity oi an nu»

alma mater is to be lrept from going

It is needless again to point out
'how much less a dollar will purchase
or pay for now, than it would live
years ago. Evcry’ sane student l'esilr
izes how much the purchasing pdwer

about half as much for thc collc'gc
now as it_did boioro Lhe war. but he-
sides that the college has had increas-
ed pay rolls. and larger expenses on
dormitory buildings and other works
than ever before; and it has been try

ture now is seriously threatened.
Seriously threatened! That is putting
it mildly. it absolutely cannot go on
without the increased endowment
towards which it is war-hing.
$3,500,000 was placed as the mini—

,mnm figure a year ago. Of this the

greater portion was to go for imluer .

The iaculty has started the ball

“Safeguarding Minorities“. In this
editorial the idea ﬁnds expression
that our national elections are large-

“bosses”. to be exact. The writer la-
.ments the lact that onc niu‘st vote
either Democratic or Republican, or
lcast a useless ballot. Which is all
1very well and good. ' ‘

0n the other hand we ﬁnd an ar-
t'iolc in the current (Deceillbel‘l) lssuc
oi llic Scarlet and Black, in which lhc
result or the most cdiiying vote on
l'Slllirlily 'ddtes’ is announced. We can.

not fail to see somewhat oi a similar-I
ity between this case and that oi the
national election, though on a smaller-
‘scale. in this casc pe'riiaps_it \vould‘
‘be unsaie to claim that “bosses" have
controlled the election. No, never,
Itlley just worded the question so that
the result would be either no change,
or the slight modification adopted.

necessary as the liarincrLahcr Furl)

SHERIDAN COMEDY
HERE NEXT WEEK

To Present "The Rivals" Saturn
day, Decembex‘ 11,

Students or drama and all others
interested in dramatic presentation
have a treat in store in the coming
or Richard hripslcy Slieridairs old
English Comedy, “The Rivals", which
will be presented at the Colonial the
sire, Saturday, December ll.

Very little need be said with regard
to the author. He is considered by
many critics .15 an English playwright
with but one superior, being second
only to Shakespeare. His play, ”The
Rivals", is one or his best comedies.
The action of the play centers about
Captain Absolute as “Beverley", and
his rival suitors tor-«the band or Lydiil
Languislr. This situation is cuilipli~
catcd by the fact that his lather, Sir
Anthony Absolute, presents him uni
dcr the name or Captain Absolute, as
a possible suitor for the hand or Miss
Langnisb. Thc situations arising
iroiu his trying to act the double part
!keep the inter-est at a high pitch
'lhroughout the play.

The Colfei'rMillci' Players form an
excellent company of players or old
English comedy. They conic bore
with very good recommendations.
Their elaborate and beautiful old
English costumes iurnlsb an excel—
lent background ior an artistic pres
scntation or this old English comedy.

The production is being brought
llelc under the auspices of aegis and
Ionian literary societies. and the pro-
cccds will be given to thc Grinncll
Movement.

Poi-hops the most langiblc example
that Lhe Gl'innell drive is considcrcd
worthy or support is the confidence
and support given it by the General
Education Board. After visiting the
college last spring, an olier or $500,-
‘000 was made, to be applied towards
tbc paying oi’incrcased salaivics’to
the faculty. As is the case or all
General Education Board slits, l‘tS
error was contingent upon Lhe colleér
tion or an additional $1,000,000 by tho
Gi'iuhell Movement,

This gilt or hair a million dollars
is the largest mndc to any college in
the Uultod States by the Board, and
was made to Grinneii after close ex-
amination of the college. It alter an

examination 01‘ the colleg'e. the Geller -

given to any other college in the

.'that the cause is a” worthy one. and
