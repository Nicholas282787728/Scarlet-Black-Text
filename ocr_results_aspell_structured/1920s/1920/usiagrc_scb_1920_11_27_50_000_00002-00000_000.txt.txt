THEY HA‘ 1E HABIT

There are low paupers in college,’

even though the allcollege hy-word
is “I'm broke". A large number of
students earn their spending money
at odd 1'th around the town, while
many receive no financial help from
outside resources. 1

to take someone else's property. There
are law who ‘would turn thiet tor the

W'hat is it than, that makes a stud-

to such a stale that he will take
something that is o: much value to
the owner? If the college is iniested
with kleptomanlacs, it is time the in-
stitution be turned into an asilum

for those afflicted wilh such menml'

disorders. To those for whose hands
the property of others is so attractive,
we might suggest that a. string be

tied around the finger to remind them

when they are in the act of assuming'
possession of someone else's books;
that it is‘nat the proper thing to do.‘
