The former possesses an aggregation

Meet Conditions of
Recent Gift.

Noltrly @1000 in cash and pledges
for the G lluell Movement has been
received at the treasurers office ac—
cording to a statement made Friday
at the movement headquarters in the
administration building. This amount
is a part of the 000,000 ll'hich‘rmust
‘Ibe raised in order to obtain the $500.-
000 conditional g t made, by the Gen-
eral Education boar-d last June.
Thoso iii charge of thc campaign
believe that the $750,000 necessary to
secure the conditional gift ol the Gen- ‘
eral Edilcfttloll‘Board will be raised
by July 1, 1021. The statement also
lcalls attention to the fact that this
is only one part of the Criiiiiell Move-
ment, and that the entire amount to
be raised is $3,500,000. The $500,000
Igift or the Education Board and the
$1,000,000 which must be raised to se—
cure it, must be kept iiiviclatc for
rise in increasing the salaries of, and
enlarging the teaching staff of the
college.

-l=rcsident biain, in speaking of the
lcarupaign for $3,500,000, said: “This
is the minimum amount that we
shorﬁd have in order that we may go
forward and keep pace with the grow-
ing demands of present day educa-
tion. The amount of money required
,is small as compared with the great
