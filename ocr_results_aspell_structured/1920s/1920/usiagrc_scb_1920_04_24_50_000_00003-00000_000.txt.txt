antness. No oer-man was excited
about the peace terms, and the signs
'Gerinuny welcomes hei- victorious ur-

ually believes this.

"'All wars are taught for commer-
cial supremacy,’ they say. 'We in-
tended to do a lot we didn’t do but
still /we came out on top. We have
to reconstruct the world out we are the

hoislievlsm Due to German Plums.

Mr. Dawson asserted that Bolshev»
lsrh was launched in Russia through
German inﬂuence and that its spread
is due to German agents, Through
stirring up the old class hatred Ger-
many hopes to cause internal division
among the allies, This secured she

in the empire. Mr. Dawson is sure
that Germany herseli will not tails
over Bolshe m and thnt news disr
patches in’ 5 this are deliberately
colored by t press censor Who is a
former spy and secret agent.

Against such tor-reaching nlans Mr.
{Dawson urged a revival of the united
iront which the allies demonstrated at
the close of the war and which seems
now to have broken. He believes that
we draw our opinions or the other ai-
lies'only from our knowledge of the
ten per cent in prominence. and that
at the bottom there is a real inter-nu.
tionnl sympathy.
