THEY WANT YOUR SERVICE.
During 1913-19 we received olflclal
requests from employers in fortyrthi'ee
states and four foreign countries tor
six thousand ﬁve hundred and thirty-
foui- teachers, These were for all sorﬁ
of positions from Kindergarten to
State University. It you want a posi-
tion with the most progressive and
best paying employers you must use
the same service they use when in
need of teachers. Experienced and in-
experienced teachers neoded in all lines
of school Work. Better write for in-
teresting booklet "FORWARD 0R
BACKWARD" today. No enrollment
fee necessary when registering with
this Association. We recommend only
when asked to do so, This is why the
best employers nsk for our profes<
Sional services.
