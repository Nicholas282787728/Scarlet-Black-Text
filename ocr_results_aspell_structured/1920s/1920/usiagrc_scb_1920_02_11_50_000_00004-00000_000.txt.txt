or the girls in the individual cottages
in regard to noise and lights, relative
to the number of occupants in each
cottage. The ﬁnal decision Was made
by the averaging of the three reports
turncd in at intervals during the
period of the contest

RENT EXPERIMENTAL
l STATION IN JAMAIGA

Grinnell Helps Support Botanical
Research Lab With Other
colleges.

Cincllona Station, a Botanical 11e-
search laboratory, located in the
southern mountains of Jamaica, is be-
ing Supported by Grinnell College, in
connection with a number of other
American institutions.

The Cinchona was ﬁrst established
by the British government at the time
of their occupation of India, when they
were searching for places suitable for
raising Cinchona, the source of Qui-
nlne. Tho station was not successful
and was vacated, standing idle for a
number of years.

American colleges were ﬁrst inter»
cstcd ill the location through the of»
forts of the Botanical Department of
Johns-Hopkins University, which has
llcen using the place at intervals.
The matter was put ill the hands of
the Slllltllsoninll Inslitute, at Washing-
ingtoll, the agency for international
scientiﬁc work, with the result that
the establishment in Jamaica was
rentcd for a period of years.

The Cinchona Station is in
midst of a very fertile ﬁeld for Bot-
anical Research, and bids fair to prove
01‘ great value to American education-
al iiistituﬁons.
