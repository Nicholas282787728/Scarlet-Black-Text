Many Attend Thirtieth
Annual Girls’
Appearance.

Before one of the largest audiences
that ever attended a home concert, the
Gil'ls' Glee Club scored a decided hit
in their annual appearance at Herrick
Chapel last night. The white gowns
of the girls were effectively set off
against the dark background and the
green setting oi the stage, Music of
the ﬁnest type, and clever, jolly
“stunts" kept the interest keen every
minute of the entire program.

The Glee Club showed a splendid
balance of well blended voices, and
sang with elfective expression in their
three special numbers and encores.
A feature of one encore was the
whistling obligato by Mary Cascaden.

Soloisls it Feature.

Maud Hutchins as soloist displayed
8. sweet and pure voice. Lucile MG-
Dannell, violinist, accompanied by or—
gan and piano, played the “Meditation”
from "Thais" with richness and beauty
of tone and expression.

The Glee Club are fortunate in hav-
ing a pleasing reader in Jean Smith,
whose work was natural and enjoy-
able, The "meddling" of the "merry
meddlesome maids,” with their lan—
guishing saxophone artist and ener-
getic solo dancer gave the audience a
hearty laugh,

Part Two of the program was c'i
scene in an Indian lodge at sunrise,
made “effective by lighting and cos—
tunliug. Arrangements of several
peculiar and fascinating melodies col—
lected from various tribes of American ,
Indians were sung by the Glee Club
and four soloists, Misses Roberts, Wil- i
kins, Parkhill, and Slater.

Bachelor Itow In Evidence.

The traditional "bachelors row" was
part of the evening and was occupied
by those whose particular friend or
friends were members of tho glee club.
Favors were distributed to the bache-,
101's in these Seats at the enfl of the
ﬁrst part of the program.

The girls attribute much of the suc~‘
cess of the m‘ogml‘n to the efrorts of
Prof. G. L. Pierce, whose skill in be
ancing the parts in the club was evi—‘
dent throughout.

To Play “Heda Gabler”
Under Auspices of
Aegis Society.

ll

Madame Bol‘guey-Hanlmer. noted
Scandinavian actress, and her com-
pany, the Hammer- Players, will pre-
sent Ibsen's "Hedda Gablel'" at the
Colonial theater April 3, under 'the
auspices of Aegis society. The well—
known players had been booked for
Grinnell by the Men’s Glee Club for
December 9th of last year, but because
of the coal shortage it became neces~
carry to cancel the engagement. An
offerito bring the company here for
one night was accepted by tlfe society
yesterday. ‘

One of Ibseii's Best

The play "Heda Gabler” is one of
Ibseu's three best plays, according to
critics who have studied his works.
"The Dolls House," is the best known
of his works in America, and was to
have been given at the appearance of
the company herein December. "Heda
Gabler" was ﬁrst produced in 1890. It
was immediately popular in Germany
and Denmark, being produced with
record runs in both countries. Its
popularity soon spread to all the cities
of Europe.

Miss Elizabeth Robbins brought the
[play to America for the first time in
‘1899. Later the actress Nazimova, who
has appeared in several dim plays here
lately, appeared in “Heda Gabler" with
huge success in both Boston and New
York. At present Madame Hammer
has made her company famous among
traveling companies through this
vehicle.

Tragedy or Human Despair.

Tlte theme of the play centers about
,the despair of a woman who gradually
discovers lier limitations. So great
lie the desire to show her per.
sonal power, and so futile are her
latteinpts, that in the end she sends a
-man to his death.

The Hammer Players have been
playing exclusively in educational cir~
,cle’s and have passed the most sliep l-
‘cal criticisms of their hearers, They
came to America with the recommen—
‘dation of the Swedish playwright—
statcsman, Biorncstemc Bjernseu, who
is one of the loading Scandinavian
’criu‘cs. '
