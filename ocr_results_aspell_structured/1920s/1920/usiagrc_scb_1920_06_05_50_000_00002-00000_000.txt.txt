Her answer is ”Green River"

for refreshment, a cooling,
sparkling, delicious drink.

WHAT 00 YOU THINK?

IF Grinllell football team should
next year play a dirty, unfair game
throughout the season?

In Grinnell‘s basketball
should play a shady under-hand
next Winter?

in Grlunell's traeh
use unfair methods
next spring

IF these men cheated in competi-
tion we would condemn them even
though they were representing Griir
nell,iwouldn't we?

We expect and We have a right to
expect that our athletic teams and our
debate teams which represent Grinnell
to the outside world play fair and
clean. ,

But at the same time isn't it just as
essential that we play fair and square
on the home lines so that the Grinnell
that is represented is not misrepre—
sentel‘l'! .

What I'm talking about is the time
honored pastime of cribbing in exami-
nations. Call it cribbing, or cheating
or lying. its all the same. Perhaps
“cribbing" sounds a little more "gen-
teelr" ‘

Anyway we all know its done add
we know its wrong and we know why
its wrong, but still we still persist in
doing lL

The greater part of this cribbing is
done by the present Freshmen and
the tault of the upper classmen than
