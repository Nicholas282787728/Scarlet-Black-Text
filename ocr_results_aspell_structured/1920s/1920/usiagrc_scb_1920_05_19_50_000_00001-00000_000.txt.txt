Hitting when hits meant runs, Dur»
mitory One defeated Building Three 5
to 4 Tuesday alteriloon ill one of the
best games played on Ward ﬁeld in
tho Dormitory baseball league this
spring. A strong north wind made
tlies hard to judge, and was responr
sible for both sides getting hits of
the ”Texas leaguer" variety.

Both sides made two runs apiece
in the ﬁrst inning. From then until
the ﬁfth frame when Dormitory One
pushed across three runs on three hits
and an error, both teams were reared
in one, two. three order. Not a man
on either Side reached ﬁrst in the
Sixth. On their last time at bat in
the ﬁrst of the seventh, the Three»ites
crossed the rubber twice as a result

clean single. With two down, the ty-
ing run on second, Herbrechtsmeyer,
who had previously made two two-bag-

hands at short, ending the closely-con-
tested fast battle.

Bishol; HllO‘hes Talks
0n Courage Sunday

"Courage" was tho subject or an ad-
dless delivered by Bishop Edwin H.
,Hughcs. formerly of Griniiell but now
,ot Boston. Mass, prior to the concert
given by (he Gi'lnnell College Ol‘ClIESA
tl't't in Herrick Chapel, Sunday evens
ing. May 16.

“There are three parts to courage,"
said Bishop Hughes, "First, a man
must not work for seltish ends, but
he must be dominated by a great prim
ciple or ideal if he is to he truly cour~
agemls. The selfrcentcred man or woe
*lnztu cannot achieve this state, Sec—
and. there must he a great tremor.
That is one must he agitated by, and
overcome. tear it' he is to attain this
idealistic condition. LaslIV. there
must be zt :rl‘dt obit-ethic. The chief
difficulty today is that most men lack
perspective. They have no vision. The
man who is to be truly courageous
must have a deﬁnite, altruistic end
which be is striving to attain, it he is
to hrucﬂt by and be of beneﬁt in the
world."

Bishop Hutches is well acouainted
with Griunell, having occupied the pule
nit of the local Methodist church for
a number of years, and also having at-
tended Grinnell College for a period.
His father was pastor or the same
Church and a rcsident of Grinnell for
some sixteen years. Bishop Hughes
was heard by It crowd that ﬁlled the
Chapel almost to overflowing.
