College Teaches Men
Inner Creative Life

“To be a participant and a creator
in life and not merely a spectator was
the old version or a poet and it is this
hind or a poet that I believe Grinuull
turns out,” declared lilrs J. J. shier-
tellko in her chapel talk Tilesdzt..
“The tendency at America has been to
make her men machines. \iaii's ere
atire power has been applied to mue
chines and not to himself, College
liie prepares uiaii to do really tine
creative thiiiesiiithin himself, The
strident should learn to work for the
iove or periection and for the doing

and not lo rthe grade and the desire
to get a task completed and out of the
way."
