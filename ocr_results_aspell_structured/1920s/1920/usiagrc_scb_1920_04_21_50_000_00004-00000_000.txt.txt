Pretty Enough for
Formal Occasions

Practical Enough
for Every Day

EVER have we displayed such dainty

effects in women’s pumps as we have

this spring. Women who take genuine
pride in their appearance will ﬁnd a real
charm in the latest styles just received.

 

A look at them will quickly tell the story
of what’s being worn in the fashion centers.

To walk in them is to enjoy the ease that
is generally lacking in other shoes.

BUILD OPEN AIR
THEATRE AT QUAD

To Encourage Outdoor Dramatic:
In New Theater Project.

A small open air theatre seating ap-
proximately two hundred and titty
people is being erected on the west
side or the Quadrangle, for the pur-
pose of creating a greater spirit of fel-
lowship among the women of the col»
lege hy iostering outdoor singing and
acting.

Complete plans were drawn by Mr.
Ray r. Weirick, college landscape or-
chitect, and it is planned to make the
theatre ﬁt in with the rest or the land-
scape hy planting shrubbery around
it. The seats are to he built of wood,
and pointed dark green.

Informal programs of various kinds
will be held there from time to time,
and a May party may be the opening
feature at the new project.

Gradation Between
Good and Evil Hard

"In judging good and evil the tangle
of issues lies not in the extremes but

 

in the gradations between the two",
said Prof. C. F. Lavell at Vespers Sun-
dirty. “Too sharp a distincﬁon should
not be made between good and evil
while judging the misdeeds and mis-
takes of others." Speaking or the
greatness of ideals, he said that the
higher the ideal, the less likely one
was to commit a wrong incompatible
with it but that the struggle to err
would come some place in the inde-
ﬁnitely classiﬁetl issues between the
extremes of right and wrong.

“Social changes should work toward
the end of liberation of personality",
declared Prof. c. R. Owens in Chapel
Tuesday. "There must be a new con—
coption of the importance of tasks
Democracy should emphasize the dig-
nity of labor. The work itself is not
cnough to call forth heroism, To make
the common working men a tool loi-
our advantage is a sacrilegc. We must
remember his divinity and tree his
persunallty’h

Mike Augustine, lorm'ér Grinnell ‘
college football, baseball, track and
