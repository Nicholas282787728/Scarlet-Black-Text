\l'ill‘Fl‘ighh‘sn You. .

The examination spectre has again
deserted its six months old grave to
spread terror in the hearts or students.

Since ignorance breeds fear we may
be able to dissipate the gho’st by lil-
vestlgating its nature.

The ﬁrst phenomena which is ap-
'Dal-eut i5 Ihe/ fact that the uneasy
shade is not seen by those students
who have industl'luusly kept up their
.class room work irom day to day.

The knowledge seekers who have
departed iron. the straight and narrow
path at wisdom in
primmse lanes of ‘social “(in es"
and "outside interests" are those whose
miseries are added to by this frighttul
spook or academic lite.

Midnight oil is the only magic
which will lay the ghost. But this
shortcut to the path or Wisdom is
but a blind alley.

It is generally conceded that a col—
lege is a place to acquire knowledge
and to learn how to use it. The iron—

rder to tread the

tie search for facts whichygoes by the ‘

name of “cramming" serves neither of
these purposes.

it you are among the lucky number
who have done their class room work
as it came you may safely laugh at the
examination spéotre and. unless pity
moves you to silence, at those unlor—
tunates‘ who are im victims.

‘ln cementing on the Treaty Ref-
erendum recently hel'd‘in the colleges
of the country one editor remarks that
too much seriousness must not be at-
tached to the opinion of college stud<
ents since they represent a small class
and one which is inexperienced and
poorly informed on political questions
or the day.

It is discourlim‘lig but none the less
true that this assertion cannot be suc—
cessfully denied. The life ot college
students or the p‘resent day is so ﬁlled
with social‘octivitics and outside inter-

ests bCSldeS their egnlzu' work that but
few have time or inclination to keep
posted on the course oi events in that
World which is so much larger than
the narrow academic life which sur-
rounds them,

it is true that the college students
or the country make up a relatively
small group. The size does not melts-
ul‘e its importance. From its milks
must come the world leaders Ol t0-
morrow.

Never before have American colleges
had a greater opportunity to make
themselvcs felt in politics. The (act
that an intercollegiate reaty-roteren
dum was held and its results given
nationwide publicity and attention is
indicative o: the trend of events.

The Republican party is olicring
$10,000 in priges in an effort to inter-
est the young people in national poll-
‘tlcs. Will Hays. chairman ol the Re-
puhlican Committee, says: “The poll-
‘tics of our country will be immeasur-
ably better ii we have tho aroused and
continuing interest or young people in
the practical affairs of the parties. It
matters not so much which party they
belong m as that they take an active
part." ' ‘ ‘

Opportunity is knocking at our door.
Let us not keep her waiting.

FIRST MOVEMENT.

When you've left your semester's work

And you’re cudeavoring to cram it
into your stubbornly resisting

In (chunks throughout the nocturnal
hours.

And suddenly

Out go the lights, and you are plunged
in total darkness

And rumor tiles through the Quad

That they will be put out each night

To kccp the flu away (it's scared or
the dark).

SECOND MOVEMENT.

And then you ﬁnd out that it's all a
mistake,

And you can sit up

And cram

And get the flu

As much as you please.

"His Bridal Night”, the sparkling
musical farce, generally acclaimed as
one or unusual excellence, will be the
attraction at the Colonial tomorrow
night. its appearance here is one or
the real events of the local theatrical
season and adtauce interest in the
management is keen and indicates big
business. The book oi "His Bridal
Night,” by Margaret luayo, whost‘l
“Twm Beds" is well remembered, calls
for two girls who look so much alike
that no one can tell them apart. They
are hard to ﬁnd‘ but the Parker Twins
were discovered in vaudeville, where
they had been creatinga stir because
or their remarkable likeness and son-
sational singing and dancingability.
They completely ﬁll the bill. It is
claimed that when pay day comes the
manager oi the company insists that
both appear at the same time, he not
being willing to take the chance of the
one repeating and getting the salaries
or both. -
