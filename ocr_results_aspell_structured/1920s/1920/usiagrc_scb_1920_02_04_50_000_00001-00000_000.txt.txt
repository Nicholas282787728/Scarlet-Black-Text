HOLT DISCUSSES
OLD TESTAMENT

Lectures at Tuesday Chapel in
Absence of Giddings.

In the absence oi Professor Ciddings
at the chapel hour Tuesday morning
Rev. A. E. Holt gave the lecture on
“The Industrial Background of the
Old Testamen " which be was to have
given in the aitcrnoon session of the
Fellowship Conference.

Rev. Holt discussed the form and
development of the social'organiza»
tinn oi the Hebrews, centering his dis-
cussion around the contributions of
Abraham, Moses, Samuel, and 5010*
map, and showing the development
and decay of what has been character--
ized as "the world’s ﬁrst democracy."

The Hebrews under Abraham were
described as organized into a tribal
community with a strong feeling of
brotherhood, and an elected ruler.
Friln this smtus the nation was de-
graded and enslaved by the Egyptians.

To Moses, brought up in the luxury
of the Egyptian Court, tell the task or
arousing his people to their ior-mer in-
dependence. This accomplished he
also secured the fundamental moral
code, which they carried with them to
the promised land.

In Canaan, the individualistic civili-
zstion of the Hebrews prevented
united action for the common good.
With Samuel as the guiding spirit,
military strength was ﬁrst secured un-
der Saul, and then spiritual integrar
tion thru David. The social organi-
zation was then at its height.

With the advent of Solomon, how-
ever, a hereditary kingship was setup
and the power of the common council
was dropped. Heavy taxes, to maina
tain a court of luxury, slave gangs
drafted to accomplish public works,
give evidence of Solomon’s attempt to
ﬁt the wrong type of life on the He-
brew people. Unrest and dissatisfacr
tlon increased until undcr Rheaboztln
the tribes of the north secured their
freedom in an epoehamaklng revolt
against oppression and autocracy.
