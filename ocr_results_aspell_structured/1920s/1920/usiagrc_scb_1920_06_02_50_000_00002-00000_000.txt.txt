A
tad has passed orcr the entire country

slightest pretense
If a count were to be taken of the
number or students, or the percentage
of the strident body with
these activities, it is very probable
that the number wolild be very small,
because it so happens that
man gets into one thing, he knows no
bounds and it efﬁcient, and proceeds
to be taken into other organizations
on the campus, some at which are the

sercalled "thank you" jobs, and others

connected

when a

honorary positions.

The afﬁliation with a large number
of activities is detrimental both to the
man and to the organization with
which he is connected. it in several
jobs at the same time, he cannot do
any single job right and the job sut-
fei's. He has not the time to pay to
his college class work, and his grades
siitler. He does not give himseit en-
tirely to any single work. and he
knows little about any one at them.
His experience which is the valuable
thing about outside work, is merely
superﬁcial and he is master ot noth-
ing.

Perhaps most important or all, how-
ever, is the fact that his being con-
nected with so many atrairs cuts out‘
others who may be as good, but who
have not had the opportunity to show
themselves. The time has come when
a man must carefully choose one out»
side interest and make that his major
work outside oi the classroom. There
are two sides to college education.
one is‘ the curriculum side, and the
other is the outside activity side. The
ﬁrst gives the student his education.
the other gives him his experience in
a business and managerial way.

The method used at the Quadrangle,
known as the point system, wherein
every activity counts so many points,
and no one person
than the limited number of points for
outside activity might be applicable to
the whole college. We doubt whether
even this system is strict enough.
When the strident comes to college, he
should try to get into the thing that
interests him most, and to which he
can give the most valuable service. II
he is an actor he should tryout tor the
Dramatic clubs. it interested in
Journalism, he should work on the,
publications, Athletes should world
on their chosen sports, and when a
man has chosen one linc of work, he
should conﬁne his activity to those
lines.
