The Zoehne‘r String Quartet, which
will play in Herrick Chapel Tuesday
evening, February 10, at. 8 o'clock, is
an unusual organization. It is made
up 0! members of one family and. has
existed as, a serious musical organi—
zation since the youngest son, Aman-
dus, was seven and a half years old.
Naturally this long association in both
family and musical life has tended to
create a deeper sympathy among the
members of the quartet, and this gives
unity to the ensemble.

While the Zoellners are thoroughly
American, they have shown their mu-
sical standing by having played in
all the European art centers. During
the past six years they have played
in practically every city in the United
States and Canada, having given their
500th concert recently. Such a record
is evidence of the quality of their
ability, ‘

Grinnell music lovers who heard
the Zoellners two years ago are look-
ing forward to the concert Tuesday.

Parker Will Head
Pioneer Football
Eleven For 1920

Donald K. Parkcr, '21, was elected
captain of the 1th football sqllnfl
Wednesday afternoon. The first elec-
tiori, held shortly after the enforced
"coal vacation," resulted in a tie, mak-
ing another balloting necessary.
Parker played fullback the past sear
soir, being in practically every min-
rite of play, and displayed great ab l-
ty- on both offensive and defensive.
He first won his letter on the State
Championship team of 1915.

Providing a football Coach can be
secured for spring tutoring, spring

year. Efforts are being made to land

The routine of organization work
for the three and a half million dollar
endowment fund campaign which op-
ened last November- is progressing,
according to word received here.

Dr. Albert Shaw, '79, publisher of
the Review of Reviews, is head of the
eastern campaign,
of Des Molncs, is head of the work in
Iowa, and Judge Win. A. Sloane, of
Los Angeles, is director of the work in
southern California. Professor- R. H.
Pei-ring is in Los Aiigcles now organ-
izing the alupiiii of that part of the
country for the work of promoting the
campaign. President Main will leave
the last of this month to spend March
on the west coast, speaking at alumni
meetings, and has several important
addresses scheduled, all of which will
further interest in the campaign.

The campaign is divided into three
main parts. The ﬁrst months are be—
ing spent in organizing Crinncll
alumni and friends for the actual work
connected with the drive. This period
will end in February, and about the
ﬁrst of March the period of publicity
or instruction of the general public to
the necessity of funds, and about the
college in general will begin. Later
the last, and m6ét important period as
far as results go, will begin, that of
actually soliciting the funds,

The plan is to have the campaign
end at commencement time this next
June. At that time it will be known
whether the campaign has obtained
the hopedefor results,

President Main is the directing head
of the whole campaign, and is direct-
ing the work from three main offices.
The main office is in Des Moincs.
where headquarters are in the Polk
Building, under the name of The Grin»
hell Advancement Fund. Offices for
the East are in New York, and for the
west in Los Angeles.

END TREATY SQUABBLE
URGES LRULGIDDTRBS

Business ztt 01d Stand as Soon
‘As Possible Important
Thing, He Says,

“The important thing is to end the
treaty controversy and get back to
business at the old stan ' said Prof.
F. H. Gidtlings ill ztn interview granted
Friday.

He declared himself as favoring the
League of Nations although he re-
alized that it was not, at present,
by any means a perfect thing.

If only the present were to be con-
sidered, Professor Giddings thinks it
would be Safe to pass the Covenant
as it now stands without reservations.
In his opinion there is no question
that the League of Nations Covennnt'
is not expected to have ascendancy
over national laws and constitutions.

Gil 5 Reasons,

However; he favor a clearcut un-
derstanding of the relationship for two
reasons.

(l) Such an understanding would

(2) He pointed out that whereas
the present generation of statesmen
understand this relation between na—
tional and international law, future
political leaders will be removed from,
contact with the original interpreta-
tion anti inisunderstaridiug might re—
sult..

A statement by Professor Giddirigs
during the course of his lectures to‘
the effect that at the prCant time
there could lie no inter—racial demos
rmcy, was pointed out to irini as
being a possible arsiimcrit agar st the
League of Nations. Iii replying he
stressed the fact that he had said,
“at the present time.” and dcclaredi
that "although an interracial flemoel
cracy is impossible at the pl‘esfllt
time, this does not mean that it will
not be a reality at some future time."
He made it clear that this was the
ultimate goal toward which civiliza—
tion was striring. Tire League of
Nations ' a step in the right direc—
tion, he intimated.

Publicity Is Solution.

Publicity of necessary information,
Professor Giddings held out, is the
only sound solution of the strike prob—
lem.

l

T

"If an attempt is made to rob men
of the right to strike in general in-
dustry, a social revolution will be pre-
cipitztted," he said.

First, Professor Ciddings would have
the whole truth known. Next, he
would have the necessary information
tabulated ill usable form—not in each
individual case, but iii a general
Way—for an entire industry. On One
Side it would be known what the av-
eragc, maximum and minimum proiit
made by the owners amounted to, and
on the other, What were the maxi-
mum and average wages being paid.
together with accurate data, regard-
ing the standard of living of the
workers.

In this way the justice of conﬂict-
ing claims would become known and
public opinion would force a settle-
merit.

At last the black Cat shrinks- in

from pillar to post the Object of our

HOLT SPEAKS—AT
JOINT Y MEETING

:Romance of Community Building"
Is Subject.

l
l

- 'A. E. Halt of Boston, national
social service secretary of the Congrc
gational Church, talked on “The RO-
manco of Community Building" at a
joint meeting of the v. if. C. A. and
the Y, W. c.’ A. at Her ck Chapel
Thursday night.

As one of the best examples of suc»
cessful community building he cited
the experience of Nehamiah in build
ing up the city of Jerusalem.

"The state of Iowa and other states
have the right to expect that college
students help build up the communi-
ties of which they are a part," accord-
ing to Dr. Holt.

He believes that it is no use to in-
troduce scientific farming agencies
and clubs when the religious life of
the community is degrading and that
it is up to the college students to
build up this community life.

The fundamental thing in common-
ity building is public good will and
the leadership of a man depends not
only upon community enthusiasm but
also upon a knowledge of organizing
communities. "The community life
of every city is built on the sacriﬁce
of teachers, preachers, and other types
of social service workers who are
scantily paid for the great work they
do," he said.

association is made up of about
twenty-live pastor-ates in the vicinity

dsr"; Rev. A. E. Holt, who spoke on

the Bible"; H. L. Haywood, of the
College, who lecturdd on “New Lights

tional Church of Marshalltown was
chairman of the meetings, and Rev.
C. E. Cushman, of Monticello, was sec-
ietai . Professor Chas. Noble was in
charge of the arrangements this year,
and was assisted by the local offices
of the Congregational Conference. All
