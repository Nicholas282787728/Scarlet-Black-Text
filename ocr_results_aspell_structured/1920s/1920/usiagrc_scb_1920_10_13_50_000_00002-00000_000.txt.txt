COLLEGE LIFE AND THE
SLUMSl

The coming of “Dad" Elliott

has brought into the lilllvlight the‘

whole category of old questions
of college life that have been in
the dusty part of tlle minds of
most of the students for many
months. It is a good thing to
bring them forth for a good airing
once in a while, and with them
coming from the healthy lungs of
“Dad“Elliott, they get a real
airing, whether warm or other
wise.

Although Elliott’s style of pre--

sentation is distinctly of the Billy
Sunday type, he must be given
credit for deep study and for much
experience in the problems with
which he deals. During his travels
and work among university and
college students, he has formed
strong opinions on most of the
questions of college life,‘ and the
most praisevvorthy thing about it
all is his extreme loyalty to his
convictions, In fact he challenges
anyone to show him Where he is
Wrong.

The effectiveness of Mr. El-
liott’s words is greatly diminished,
however, by his very radical and
seemingly impossible statements.
He admits that he gives the en
treme cases for examples, but we

must take exception to one state?

ment which he makes, namely that

social life in college is of a loll‘el‘_

type than that in the slums of the
large cities. This is putting it
pretty strongly, to say the least,
and such a statement casts a
shadow of doubt ovenhis entire
lecture. There may be many cases
of deplorable social conditions in
some parts of the large universi-
ties, but that we can find a lower
social life in the college than in
the slums of the large cities is
hardly within the realm of reason.
Though his views of college life
are pessimistic, to say the least,
he makes many good points, and
by carefully digesting his statc~
ments, it will be foluld that his
experience agrees with that of
many investigators, His state-
ments regarding the honor system
may have ground in many insti-
tutions. The honor system has not
been attempted in Grinnell for a
number of years, if at all, Imt the
only real difference between tlu
honor system and the usual s
tem lies in the fact that in one case
the students not as proctors over
each other, and in the second cast-
the instructors take the part of the
proctol's. \Vhilc the Scarlet and
Black does not in any way believe
in cheating in classroom, it alsl
thinks it a great deal to ask of a
student, that he be responsible for
the punishment of a fellow stu»
dent. .[t is, after all, a matter for
the individual conscience.
Statements regarding the frater-
nity system will ﬁnd much favor

ml, as second ,. .

around Grinncll, since in general
it agrees with the faculty and
administration attitude. Elliott.
will also ﬁnd local favor in his 1)th
tion regarding foreign students.
l‘tnce differences have been found
to make little difference in Grin-
uell. The personality of two men
being equal, race difference will

DANCING LESSONS.

\Vith the resumption of the rec-
reation hours, comes the sugges-
tion that the dancing lessons
started last year be kept up, so
that. opportunity might be given
to those who do not dance, to
learn the muchsought after art.

Judging from the number of
inquiries received at the Scarlet
and Black office, it would appear
that if the dancing lessons were
StﬂJ‘tcdhonce more, they would
prove more popular than last year.
Several men have agreed among.
themselves that if the lessons were
resluned, they would go and learn ,
