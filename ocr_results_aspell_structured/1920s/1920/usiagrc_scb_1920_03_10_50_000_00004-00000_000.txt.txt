Quadrangle Gossip

“Yell, Tubby!”
And Tlley Botll Blushed.

Election'eerirr'g has been rife in the
Quad during the past week. League
oliicers and quiet-hour pmctors have
been the victims. Jealousy and riv-
alry have turned lriend against lriend.
Who says women can't play politics?

Sprig Is Cull.
We have a new hair cut—
Spr‘ig is cub;
The young man's laney has turned,
Sprig ls cub: ,
There will he a.‘ moon spring vacar
tion e
Sprig is cub:
We have been to a picnic already.

 

PECK'S mm nor.

if 8. play lasts for three canscutive
seasons, the author and producer count
themselves lucky. A few. it is true,
hare stood the wear and tear of time
and change in public taste for a period
of ten seasons, but you can count tbern
on the dngers of one hand. .

But when a play can continue sea.—
son after season-toi- a period of‘over
a quarter or a century. it is little
snort or a marvel.

Such a play is Peck’s Bad Boy.
Plays may come and plays may go but
Governor PeCk’s doliglrtlul comedy of
American boyhood- llke Tennyson‘s
Brook bids lair to go on forever.

The reason tor its great hold on the
theatre—gains public is easy to under-
stand, once you know its secret.

No truer picture or Young America
was ever painted by brush or pen. It

 

 

is a portraiture that appeals to both
young and Old.

The young love Peck’s Bad Boy be-
cause he is a child, like themselves,
bubbling over with Childish Cntilllslr
asrn, and their elders because he re.
ﬂeets their awn childhood, and is there
one among us who does not like to
live, if only in retrospect the day of
youth again. Briefly this is the se-
cret of this grand old plav's success,
itﬂ naturalness, its truthfulness and its
cleanliness.

All the world loves a boy, and be-
cause Peck’s Bad Boy is the best and
truest type or boy ever conceived by
an author. is the reason he will Con—
tinue to delight thousands for years to
come.

This excellent company will a‘ppear
at the Colonial Theater on Monday.)
