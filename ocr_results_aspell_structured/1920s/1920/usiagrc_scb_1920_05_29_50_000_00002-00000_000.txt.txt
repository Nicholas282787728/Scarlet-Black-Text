We intro come upon an editorial in

iowii's Athletic Board lids taken
a stand ngainst the smaller col»
iegcs oi the state and will not
send its track team to the state
meet under the present circum
stances. Iowa is the state Univ
siiy. the biggest educational iiisti-
tiiiion in the state, and its athletic
teams have shown an unques-
tioned supremacy over those ot
any other school.

In state meet aliairs Aines has
acted reasonably. Drake and Grin-
neii are continually harping and
blocking action. They have two of
the tour votes in tiie State Games
committee and hence have fre-
quently used this power to ginn
the machinery.

whether the State track meet
will he an attraction without the
participation or Iowa is not the
question. A principle is involved.
The Athletic hoard is conﬁdent it
has been doubleacrossed and is
disgusted with the usurpation of
power by its Would-be rivals, lowa
does not propose [0 jump every
time a sinaii school tinkles the
symbols. state honors are not the
biggest goal for Iowa athletics.
Their ambitions are to defeat the
nest in the Big Ten and not waste
their energy squabbling over petty
grievances caused by several state
colleges. The time has come for
Iowa to asse

self at this time, but heiore she does
so, The Scarlet and Black respectfully
requests her to look into past records
or the state athletics and see where
she stands.

Ginnciiig hack into the history of
state track and ﬁeld meets, we cannot
help but note that Grinneli has won
more state meets than has our neigh-
bor to tile east, and in the Drake Re-
lay carnivals we believe that Grinneii
scored at least as iiiiicii as has Iowa.
in football and basketball Grinneii is
not at all or
against hoth schools in and outside or

ashamed her record

As tor the iareiin throw, Iowa does
not know peiiiape that Grinneii has a
men who can throw it as far as the
Iowa weighi man has shown in recent
meets, and this man has had no prac-

Ever since the building or the (lore

growing tendency to make the inheri-
