KANSANS PICK MATES

In a recent contest hold on the
campus of the University of Kansas,
"now would you choose a mate?" a
number of interesting answers were
recorded.

According to the women, their men
must show “pep, wage earning ability,
the inclination to improve, and a good
‘slzeahlc bank account,”

Tllc men say that their mate must
be a good companion, but they don't
seem to think about housekeeping and
cooking, as the men never mention it.
