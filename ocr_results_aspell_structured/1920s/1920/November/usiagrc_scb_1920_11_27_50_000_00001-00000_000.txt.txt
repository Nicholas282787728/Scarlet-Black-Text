Review Season
Now that the gri iron season is
over Gl‘inilell can pause 'and review

'her part in middle western football.

Coach “Bud" Saunders accepted the'
position of head coach and early in’

September he issued his call for can»
didates. Only five letter men respom
ded to the call and around these men

Saunders started to build his football ‘

machine. There was much specular
tion as to whether he would succeed
in putting together an efficient ma—
chine and the students attention was
centered on the outcome of the first
game of the season, With Penn cul~
loge.

The Pioneers put away the Quakers ,
42 to 0 and their defeat was accome,

plished with apparent ease. Tire fol-
lowing \l‘cek Grinnell met Allies and
was defeated 23 to 0. Although Gi'iii-
uell received the small end of
secure all doubts as to the student
body enthusiasm were dispelled and
according to old “grads” Lhc pep at
the Ames game was the greatest in
the history of the school.
Give Washington Stiff Fight

The next encounter on the Pioneer
list was Washington. After being de-
feated by Ames Coach Saunders work-
ed his team over-time in an attempt
to get in shape for the Piker contest.

it was in this game that Griunell putl

oVer her first touchdown against Mis—
souri Valley school since her entrance.
Grinnell lost the game 28 to 13, but
showed remarkable improvement over
the previous week.

On October 30th, came the classic
of the year for Grinnell. The Pier
neers met Drake at the Drake stadium
and held the much touted Drake ag-
gregation to a 7 to 7 tie. Previous
to this encounter Drake was duped to
defeat Grinnell with ease and the re—

Zilboorg' Describes

Political Heads:

“Some Voices of Russia", a lecture
by Gregory Zilbool‘g, was presented
Friday night in Herrick Chapel as the
second number on the lecture course.
Although not yet thirty, Mr. lebool‘g
has achieved an enviable reputation
as an interpreter or Russian thought
and conditions. He is a liberal— ine
tellectllal, 2th adherent OT Kerensky
and presents his view point of Rus-
sian affairs with a quick, emotional
delivery. He has acquired a remark-
able mastery of the English language
in the ten months which he has spent
‘in America.

Russ Divided

Mr, zilboorg does not claim to give
the point of view of all Russia, for he
admits that Russian points of view
are numerous. He does, however,

the sane idealist, “Russia had no par

for the oi erthrow of Russian, not Ger.

walking for democracy through our
ballasslnent of Nicholas II.

He characterized Kel‘eilsliy {is it

the described Kolchai: as a proclaimel-
of the doctrine of the sll‘ord'; Trotsky

the plan for the Daingcrfield young
people to save the family by becoming

the role of Olivia to the ossuuicd role,

of Jane Ellen, the ir h cook, and

dominant part of the play with pro-
fessional ease. Homer Ahegglcn
made his first appearance with the
Dramatic club in this play as Burton

yond reproach and he played his part
so well that not for a moment was
his real identity shown.
Roles All Well Taken

is Concerned. Few pracﬁces have been

Robert Cushman of Monticello has?

and is a fast man at center. Ralph
Walters, captain of the prep football
squad, has also had a number of years
on the floor.

Sophs and Juniors Going Good.

The sophs have lost two valuable
men in Ristine and “Rusty" Hoyt, but
this loss will be largely offset by the
acquisition of Harris ("Peg") Mere
dith, a member of the 1918 Freshman
squad, at forward, and Lawrence Jans-
sen at center. otherwise the team
will be the same as last years, with
Fearing, Whitehill, Gossard, and Benz
in the line-up. The Juniors have sus-
tained at big loss in hoyd Shoesmith,
crack forward on the varsity last year,
Boyd having failed to return to school
this year. The team remains intact
with this exception.

Ilnﬁl'c Senior Squad Buck.

The Seniors have their entire line-
up again, with Vinsel at center, Evans.
Dwight Macy, Whiter, and lVassenaar
at for-ward and guard positiops. Due
to the fact that the present seconds
and fourth-year classes had such a
close rub last year, and that almost
the entire regular varsity line-up is

say the ilag will go to one of these
