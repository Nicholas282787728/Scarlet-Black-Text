TO MAKE FINAL DISPOSITION OF

Time Worn Question To Receive Final Verdict
At Ballot To Be Taken Next Week 7 All
College Women to Have Vote.

Final disposition of the Sunday (late question will be made at ‘vlt
mass meeting (ll i 1 college women to be held early next week at the
Qullflrilngle, according to an announcement made this noon by the

Women’s League Board.
The de

was delayed for some time because of; the uncertainty as to who had

the authority to till“) ai'tloll 0n the restriction.

on the future standing of Sunday dates
was given to the women of the college.
through the League board, by the fac
ulty administrative committee, and
plans have been going on since that
time to prepare a formal vote on the
subject.
Form Not Decided.

Just what form the question will
take, has not been decided, according
to virginia Sweney, ’21, president of
the League boar-d. Whether to bring
the uusstion before the women as a
straight yes or no ballot, without res.-
orvalions or restrictions ,or- whether
to outline a ballot with certain restrics
trons as to hours, has not been deﬁ-
nltely decided.

Opinion on the campus is that the
question will not pass if submitted to
the girls alone, The vote will he in-
ﬂuenced by the feeling that with no
restrictions on dates on Sunday, the
getrtogelher hours at tho Quadrangle
will be interfered with and inter-run
ted.

View of Outsiders.

Men students are looking at the
question as one of importance to the
whole school, from the standpoint
éi outsiders, who have difficulty in
under-standing why Sunday should be
picked as the day to restrict social ens
gagemcnts, espeClully when Sunday
is callers day in most homes. This
conconsus of opinion was expressed
upon hearing that the question was to
be brought to an issue. From the
school point of view, the'meh think
that it has little importance. but to the
outside point of View, they feel it: is
very important.

' Form Urrdeclded.

The method of balloting, and the
form of the question will not be known
until it is placed before the women at
the mass meeting. The general feeling
seems to be. according to Scarlet and
Black reporters. that it will be a good
time to take the vote and ﬁnally dis—
pose of the matter, either by removing
the restriction, or by leaving it on,
Students seem to feel that if the vote
were taken on a warm spring Sunday,
that the restriction would he removed
unanimously, but as one man at the
dorms said today, “They forget how

nice it is in the spring, when winter
is here.”

PARIS TWO YEARS
AGO IS SUBJECT

Cross Speaks to Macy Club on
Situation in France,

Reminiscences of Paris on Novenl»
her ll, 1913, was the subject of a talk
by Rev. E. w, Cross before the Macy
club in the art room of ARH Thurs—
day, A small crowd hoard Mr. Cross
tell of his experiences in France with
the American forces ,and his lll‘mrcs-
sions of France on November ll.

Au'llit Word of Armistice

“The word that Wlllium of Germany
had abdicated came all. a time when I
was at the opera. There was ilnme»
diatc rcioicing on the part of the pear
pic but the French were not cnthrr
slastic until the lrnal word that the
Armistice had been signed was re-
celved, Then the French werc happy
and sang with enthusiasm their great
marching airs,”

Today, according to Mr Cross, the
French have lost that spirit. and are
bitter and antagonistic to this gay
spirit, All of the nations have lost
that fine democratic and aggressive
spirit that prevailed for a few hours
on November 11, 1918. To lrarc a
successful Lcaguc of Nations, to lruvc
a. successful world race, lmtionzlllly,
social position ,and crop character
must be forgotten.

Although the women do not have thoir‘
choice of food as the men have, theyl
seem to be eating nearly as ravenously
as the men who eat nothing but their
favorite things.

At present there are on an average
ol eleven hundred meals served a day
at the Quadrangle. The number does
not vary much, about three hundred
eighty at lunch and dinner and a few
less at breakfast. Thc ﬁgures are,
much different at the Dorms where
the meal ticket system is in vogue.

Mrs. Powell Pleas For Sacriﬁce

"Give President Main yourself in
this campaign, because no college can
ever rise above its student body," was
the challenge Mrs. Lyman Powell gave
‘lbe girls Wednesday evening in her
‘plea to support the endowment cum-l
paign. The students can help by adver-
tlsing and telling how Grilluell’s edu-
cational and cultural ideals rank
among the highest and in order to
keep this high standard. she must,
have money to pay for the increase in t
prices as the result of the war. ‘

"Christ the Leader", is the college
motto, Mrs. Powell quoted President
Main's speech which was given at Des i
Molnes. "Christ the loader is not ul
golden thought or proverb, but a char

i-ess.”

He also said, "I would Just as soon
die in the cause of Grinnell as die on
the battleﬁeld." Mrs. Poivell‘bbmphn-
sized the fact that it is not the duty

money, but it was the duty of the trus-
tees, alumnae, and students with the
help and advice of the President and
faculty,

Slloulll Give Loyalty.

Mrs. Powell said that the students
must give their loyalty to the cams
paigm as the alumnae of Wellesley did
when their college burned. Their ens
dowment was their [bankroffel‘ing .n
