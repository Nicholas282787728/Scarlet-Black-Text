hooves a. man to live in the present,
thinking nothing of the past or of the
future except in so far as neither is
directly related to the present, But
even the philosophers who advocate
this way of life grant that occasionally
each man should climb a mountain
top and look about him.

With the end at our management of
the Scarlet and Black we have been
placed on that mountain top. We have
looked both backwards and forwards.

On the backward path we can see
the accomplishments and failures of
a trying college year, From this height
we can see that the trail we have fol-
lowed has wound through a. wild
country.

It is by no means that high road
which carried college life in the days
before the war. That road was mark-
ed aud graded by generations of col-
lege students all following the same
way. The upheaval caused by the war
destroyed most of the old familiar
laud marks and consequently we have
been blazing a new trail.

Looking down We can see that in
places difﬁculties have not been met
in the right way. There are tempor-
ary bridges that must be strengthened
and there are shortcuts which can be
safely substituted for the roundabout
path that has been renewed this year.

But. it is the future and not the past
which is imporumt. Even from our
mountain top the path ahead can be
but dimly deﬁned through the mists of
uncertainty.

That it leads on and up into an ever-
broadening highway there can be no
doubt. That there must be intelligent
perseverance in overcoming difficul-
ties is equally certain.

Eventually, we must believe, that a
reorganized Grinnell in a readjusted
world order will reach an avenue of
usefulness which it has never before
traveled.

faith that an even more glorious me

There is no room for the doubter on
our ”lupus. If a 1mm doubts let him
seek a. college which is worthy of his
faith. If Grlunell is to reLllze her
high destiny it is essential that both
those who have taught and those who
have received learning at her altars
have granted their allegiance.

Here is common ground on which
faculty,_ students, and alumni can
unite.‘ When such a brotherhood of
faith is realized then the (is! of mir-
acles for Grinnell will have come to
stay.
