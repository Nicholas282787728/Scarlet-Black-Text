Scarlet and Black sport writers have
picked the above two best all-star
baseball teams, judging the players on
their respective showings in the six

, team dormitory league just closed.

Packer and Benz would apparently
make the best battery in the donni-
tory league. Packer pitched ﬁve
games tor the Six-ites, winning tour
of them and pitching a tie game a-
gainst two, Records give him an av-
crage 0t 10 strikeuots E game. Benz-
is the best catcher the dormitories
have seen. Shoesmith. picked for the
second team, pitched but one game,

seven innings. Whether Gossard or
Moore is the best catcher is debata-
ble. Moore holds his pitchers up beta
tel. GDSSﬁl‘d is the heavier hitter of
the two.

of the two.

of the eight men picked for the two
inﬁelds, Milo Isaacson is recognized
as the best inﬁelder, Ristine, Erwin, I-
saacson and the Mucys' have played
brilliant brand of dorm league ball.
This year Wassenaar has not played
up to his old 1917 standard and was
given a close run for second team po-
sition by Whitehill. Fowler is not a
sensational player, but is most depen-
dable in the pinch.

A more sure trio than Herhrecht—
smeyel‘, Quinn and Clark in the out-
ﬁeld {or the ﬁrst team, would he hart]
to ﬁnd in Grinnell. Jones, Smalley and
Burgetl‘. are fairly sure of grabbing
ﬂies.

Interdormitory baseball brought out
a great deal of unexpected talent,
which because of the long absence of
baseball in Grinnell was not known
about. The all star series composed
of teams picked from three buildings
each is expected to test the feasahili—
w of varsity baseball next year.

Pioneer Grinnell Scenes Depleted
by Women‘s Gymnasium
Classes.

The annual May pageant was pre-
sellted Saturday afternoon by ihe \vo»
men‘s physical education classes, un»
,der the direction of Miss Clara I, An»
dersen, assisted by Miss Josephine
Hutchinson "The Spirit or Grinnell,"
was the theme or thi syeal"5 pageant,
which showed a true appreciation and
vivid representation of the spirit
which prompted the founding and the
upbuildlng cl Grinnell College. It was
divided into a prologue, thrc episodes,
and a ﬁnale.

In the prologue, the spirit of the
Prairie was interpreted by Miss Helen
Blair, then followed the coming of the
Indians, who were driven out by the
approach of the homesteaders in their
prairie schooner. In the ﬁrst episode,
the altar is dedicated to Truth, and the
Iowa Band is consecrated before it.
Virginia Sweney, as the spirit or Edu-‘
cation, later the Spirit’of Grinnell,
leads the Iowa Band to the prairie.
Frank Almy tool: the part of Youth,
the speaker’ of the Truth.

Cyclone Appears.

The second episode brought the Cy»,
clone and the overturning or the altar.
After the Cyclone, the spirit or Grin—
nell revived the Iowa Band and the
priestesscs. The third episode pre—
sented Grinnelrs part in the wars or
1861 and 1917. John Egan as War, and
his followers Greed, Lust, and Anar-
jelly, taken by Frault Dorathy, Kenneth
Geddes, and Joseph Kelley, tried to put
,oui, the ﬁre at the altar. Florence
Loose played the part or Humanity,
and Gwendolyn Townsend that of Pov—
erly. They are freed from the cape
tivlty of War by the Maiden of Peace.

Use Service Flog,

Grinnell’s future. Peace and Prosper-
ity, represented by the girls or the
glee club, laid offerings at the altar
‘of Grinnell with Gratitude, laken by
Viva Craven, joined in singing "The
spiril of Glilmoll." The Iowa Band
carried the service flag and placed it
before the altar, to symbolize conser
cration to the Work of the future.

neotliovcu Symphony popular...

0f the two symphony programs on
Monday the high point was of course
the magniﬁcent third symphony of
Beethoven on Monday evening. This
was a real test for everyone concern-
ed, the audience no less than the or-
chestra and its conductor. Not one of
these elements failed to meet the test:
the audience, by its profound attention
throughout the symphony made it pos—
slble for conductor and orchestra to
give themselves to the performance
in music that either this or any other
Grinnell festival has reached. The a-
bility of the orchestra, and the music-
ianship of its conductor Mr. chemot-
ter, need no further testimony than
was furnished by the ehthusiam or the
audience for this symphony. The Sib-
elius symphony in the afternoon. al-
though belonging to an entirely di A
[erent realm of expression, was spleu»
didly played, other orchestral num-
ber which stand out were L . .t‘s syme
plltlnic poem, Les Preludes, and the af~
lei-upon encore, a Gondoliera by L. v.
Saar. In the picturesque numbers,
such as the dances by Glazuunow and

 

the Spanish Rhapsody by Chabriel‘ the
various orchestral tricks had full
sway, and the overture to Tamman-
ser made as brilliant a grand ﬁnale

.as anyone could desire. At cveiy poinl

the orchestra completely fulﬁlled all
that could he expected of it, and no or-
chestia that has visited Grinnell has
won at more deserved success,

The singers on the symphony pi -
grams, Mr. George Rasely and Miss
Harriet McConnell, were distinctly a-
bovc the average of festival Singers,
and made a real contribution to the

programs Mr, Raser impresses one
as a singer of exceptional intelligence,
and a career of increasing success
may be expected or him. Miss McCon—
utlll has a glorious voice, at its best'
with full orchestral accompaniment.
The audiences were the Ian gest since
festivals were inaugurated in Grinneil,
every seat in the chapel was occupied
Monday evening, With an overﬂow on
the stage. The increased appreciation
of orchestral music is a sure Sign of
growth in musical intelligence, and
greater things in the future .~
