Revlewing the Review

The December number of the Grin<
nail Review not only upholds the high
standard set by the introductory Nu-
vcmber issue, but Surpasses it. It
shows itself a magazine which deals
with national and World subjects in
an interesting and valuable way. For
college students, especially, who have
time for but little general reading
and yet who are confronted with the
problem of keeping posted on the
march of cvenm the Review will be
especially valuable. The material is

concise, authon'tstive and well—written
with the added attraction that it is
not only a middleu-estern magazine.
but even more speciﬁcally a college
publication and a Grinnell product.
The most signiﬁcant part at the
editorial column from the standpoint
of the reader is the last paragraph.
The fololwing is a part quotation:
”We conceive our function as an
extension of the function of the col<
lege. We aim to illuminate problems.
to contribute to their solution, not
to furnish readyﬂnade views. Dog-
matic expressions of opinion will not
be excluded from our pages. But we
trust that in the main the method
of approach to problems will be ex»
perimentai and thoroughly open-mind»
ed. We intend that the spirit of The
Grinnell Review shall he character-
ized by independent thinking, and by
reliance upon ﬁrst hand experience.“
To such a policy we say Amen in
a publication of this type, appealing-
to the educated classes, nothing can
be more valuable than a strict adher—
ence to the scientiﬁc method.
Of the articles the one‘ on Interven-
(ion in Mexico by Loi A. R. Nyki is
especially signiﬁcant. Mr. Nykl takes
exception to the popular idea of the
Mexican people as bloodthirsty. quar~
relsonle brigands. He brands a large
number of the statements made against

Mexico as lies "launched upon the
eredulons public by the mercenary
press." “What the native population
at Mexico needs most is the school,”
he says. In dealing with the situa—
tion Mr. Nykl advises a kind and sys~
tomatie attitude on the part of the
United States as the only proper
solution.

in his article on the sulljcct “Mill-
tary Training as Education." Robert
Kerr can see no good in a program
of universal training. He bases his
arguments an army experience during
the recent war. Summarizing he says:
“When deductions are made fDl' 014
ﬁeld! contempt for the science and
practice or education, for the lack oi
battle stimulus, for the lack of com-
petcnee among the instructors and for
a subject matter remote from the pur-
sults or peace. there seems little
enough left out at which to build an
educational apparatus capable o: pre~
paring young men for civil lite."

Central Notes.

Since the vacuum has been delegab

used to afford it so much amusement.
It seems that the third floor took an
especial delight in dangling the Vacuum
liose from their Windows and arrang—

some unsuspecting second floor girl.
Then they, With malice store bought.

really too bad for the third floor.

Miss Margaret MacDonald has been

missionary from Japan, during this
week.

Cottage IV Notes.

Third ﬂour IV has a great iondncss
for beefstenk and onions at late hours.

Cottage IV was astounded to ﬁnd
that during the vacation its piano had
literally Walked away. Well, We
don't mind, it was a "i-ztttlyr'bang" old
thing, anyway, so a committee has
héen appointed and. perhaps— "We'll
start a fund for a grand piano, may-
be."

Cottage V Notes.

Cottage V gives a party tonight. In
the past they've had “peppy" parties
which showed a. lot of effort and

their “rep" you can count on a good
party.
