pcrrdrngly faster pace.

Trouble nerer comes rriia‘ccoiiipa
iried. Tho war has brought, not only
a demand tor rapid expansion, hutalso
the stulllilling blocli of high prices.

This is particularly hard on the col-
leges. The substantial citizens of the
country grumble at having to pay what
would have lre'en considered in the
pahny days before the war a prohibk
the price for slices but nevertheless
they buy the shoes and, judging from

looking for bargains. High pric‘ed

theater tickets they will buy but when
it comes to ﬁnancial support for cola
leges the high cost of living is liable
to act as an cltectire knot in their
