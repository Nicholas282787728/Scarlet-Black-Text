"There are a lot oi Lincoln's tol-
lowing the plow." quoted Mr. Crane
ny, principal oi the local high school,
when asked what students go to col-
lege. "while the colleges become rich
men's schools. There are a lot or plod-
ders who get the best grades in high
school. but who never go on." Mr.
Cranny is a cheeriul, sympathetic
man, albeit a stern disciplinarian at
times. Last winter he was elected LII-
rector oi the iowa Nine, a secondary
school torensic league.

Fourth Going to (irinuell.

"We'll probably be sending about
-wenty ireshmen to Grinnell college
next year. That will he a fourth ol
our graduating class CI eighty. A ten-
students go to Drake, 'Ames, and
lawn each year. so that the total en-
tering college is about a third oi the
class. A iew more go to business
training schools.”

"In the state colleges and at
Drake," Mr, Cranny continued. “our
students usually rank above the av-
erage. We have a boy doing excepv
tionai work at Ames, and a large
group at Laramie. Wyoming, rating
tar above the average,"

Aviation Major Inﬂu‘esf.

The principal gleaned these facts
irom an old geography converted to
a scrapbook, so that tusked Australr
ian savages and pretty Japanese girls
peeked around the corners of lists or
graduates. lie-declined to be quoted
in regard to his students' standing at
Crinnell college, asserting only that
hey are “holding their own." 1. s. U.
ends no reports to the preparatory
chools, he states

“High school seniors have no idea
~hat they are preparing for,” Mr.

ranny answered when asked what
saniPrs’ major interests are in go.
ng to college. “Questionsires reveal
almost total blankness ct mind. A few
boys can law or medicine their mar
or interest, however, and aviation is
a popular reply both for prospective
collegians and for students who do
at even intend to complete their sec-
ndary school work."

With six of seventeen contests won,
'the 1928-29 basketball season wasn’t
the success that it might have been.
Tile fact it it might have been right on
the records for live or those eleven

were actually won.

most of the contests during the latter
half of the season. Willielm's leg is
‘expected to improve and the players
have enough conﬁdence in that expec—
tation to have voted him captain tor
next season. l

 

The Pioneers last year, captained by

squad in the opening fracas, 15 to 6,‘

In addition to these men Thomis,
Murray and Cantrell were outstanding
men of the ireshman squad who should
bolster any man's basketball team.
Coach Truesdale has promised a. still
schedule next year but he expects to
have a quintet that will match it. Bad
breaks found their way in this year
but they can not continue indeﬁnitely.

Coach Lawrence E. strong at the
Albia high school, and his nephew of
Sigourney, were visitors on the Crin-

Grinnell Teaching
Value Distinctive;

tContinued tram Page 1)

In close proximity which draw stud-
ents from this college. The state uni—
versities are also Grinnell's strong
competitors.

“Grinnell is uninlormed," President
lilain stated as the word of President
Eliot in the East. “The publicity which
has been circulating about town City
and Des liloines university has brought
down a condescending (mole of mind
ol Easter-ners upon Western colleges.
especially those in Iowa." Since this
is the opinion in the East it is very
diiiicult for Crinhell to gain ﬁnancial
support in that section or the country.

‘Ricli )quls (lollegei‘

Because Grinnell is called, wrongly,
a “rich man's college" and because
it is in a district which is day ﬁnan»
cially it is not easy for the college
to get ﬁnancial aid. Easteruers who
are asked to give to this institution
always inquire why the West cannot
support its own colleges, or question
which has a justiﬁable answer hard to
explain.

“Disloyitl alumni do much damage to
the College’s standing," declared Presi‘
dent Main. “One disloyal man can do
more harm than ten loyal supporters."
