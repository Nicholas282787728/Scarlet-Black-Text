Gl'innell college is entertaining this week students
from three tliItel’enL Colleges. \Viih the group of women
debaters from Rockford. the representative from Beloit,
and the Harvard debaters We are hosts to men and home
en from three (listiuctnely different types of educational
institutions. In all of these schools there are certain
points of Silllilm'i ts \t'ell as those of contrast to Gl‘inr
hell and \\ e believe it is of value to have these representa~
ti\s here in order that We may hear OI the movements
and activities on their campuses and compare their prob

lems with those which confront us.

For this reason we are particularly glad to welcome
Arthur \i'eimcr, Beloit’s representative oi the Undel’gl‘adv
uate Speaking Exchange, here today. Grinnell collcgc
believes in this movement and feels nn cspecial pride in
its success since it had its origin here. From such com-
parisons of student lite as this exchange makes possible
there is every reason to believe on understanding of stu-
dent problcms will be increased.

A NEW ADMINISTRATION.

with the election of the house chairmen, Grinncll
inaugurates its second year of a new toriu of Student
government. It is difiicult to (letnl'mine the success of
the last administration. A grent many new features
lime been introduced into the dormitory system, such
as the reformation oi the jrepping custom, and some
attempts at improvement in Lhe dining room. However,
these suggestions are As yet untried, and it falls upon
the shoulders of the new Council to put into experiment
these new ideas. The success of any government, stur
dent, national or state, rests largely with the people them-
selves. What the people want they usually get, if they
hive the incentive and the willingness to work,

Government like u science is largely n matter of
experiment. If one set or rules proves inadequate, the
only thing to do is to change them and try something else.
Where many government rail, is in the [act that old,
inefficient regulations are alloivcd to remain on the
statute books. As long as a, law is in effect it should
be enforced by those in authority. It the people, or the
student body, feel that an, rule is unjust, they lime the
privilege and the power to make the change by going
through the proper channels. When a low hcconiesd jokr
and ts regarded as such by those “hose duty it is to
enforce it and by the people in general, it is certain
proof that there should be some alteration, Such a
problem confronts the “omen's government of Grinncll,
and is equally the concern or the college,

It has been the criticism during the last year that
student government in Grinnell e ed in name only. if
this is true, it is largely the innit of the students. it
is President Mnin's sincere wish that Grinnell hove an
efficient, harmonious form of‘governlnellt conducted by
the students. Any problem concerning the student body
also, very often, Affects the reputation of the college.
Therclorc it is quite necessary that the government must
consult the administration on many occasions.

If the administration wishes to put into cltect a new
custom, it will lime to work through the student governr
mcnt,as it )5 that body that has to enforce the proposi-
tion. Grinnell has the makings of an effective strident
government and it rests with the new Council to strength-
en and improve this form of administration.
