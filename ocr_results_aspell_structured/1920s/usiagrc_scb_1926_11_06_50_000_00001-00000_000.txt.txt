The settings ol the tin-cc plays are
varied in type. For the tirst play the
scene is laid in an Irish fisherinaris
kitchen with its old-iashioued fires
place, tnr-i lolt, and tisliiirg nets; tor
the second the scene is changed to the

, interior'oi a French chcateon with its

Each play is a diilicnlt undertaking
with character parts requiring skilliul

the lead in “Riders to the Sea" has
the role of an old Irish womair, ora-
bittered by every tragedy of life, and
in the course of the play receives the
final blow of fate with the drowning
of her last son.

In ”The Man Without a Head" Paul

Robert Berry takes the lead in “The
Lost Silk Hat” as a young English

Mournful Procession Pays

Sad Tribute To Grinnell’s
Departing Pigskin Chasers

 

, A proccsslon wcridcd its - slow—
ly [mm the dormitories to the quail-
rangle, headed by the college band,
‘wlllcli was doing its best to add z st
to a inner-cal procession. It was not
sacrcligious for the attempt at job-
ficatiou on this seeming mournlul oc-
casion, because the small remnant of
humanity which followed the nrrrsic
was trying to have a pep meeting but
they were too “damned optimistic”;
and the majority or the dear thin
bloods had stayed closely by the rudi—
ator and let thc tcam go oil to the
South without raising their voices in
loud hurrahs. ,

The procession ncd very low in
number at the quadrangle,7tlie dear
iemales were slipping their spinsterly
cups or tea or taking a much irecdcd
when the pourt or ems

barkation was reached, personal fill"

tiriions took precedence over the busi-
ness at band. A yell leader attempted
to ring yells from a crowd ct hnid
shells and, instead oi letting the team
so nit uncbccred, he did most of the
work lrirnscll.

Then the hour tor the gratiﬁcation
ot the inner man and woman came.
Thoughts or tasty tit-hits received more
attention than the tcarrr, who probably
were thinking oi raw meat cooked on
soritlrcrn campuses. When the train
finally arr edilt was the Rock 157
land up to i 5 old tricks ugnin~e gush
or awe rose lrom the ”optimists and,
in a last vain endeavor, thc cheer-
leader attempted to ring a low par-ting
cheers oi thc dormant dormites and
quadites for the "100 per cent" team.

The tuncial procession finally broke
up and the witches seemed quite put
out that there was no post-mortem to
he held.

“The white and black races will 0l|~
ly be able to get along together peace—
tully in this country wlrcir the Negroes
are governed according to the princt
ples or the teachings oi Jesus Christ,"
said S. Joe Brown, negro attorney
trom Des Moines, Thursday evening at
Y. it. C, A. meeting held in Building
Three club room. ,

Mr, Brown, who is a native oilowa,
g -adnated trim the Univer tv oi Iowa
in 1393. He is active in "Y work in
Des Moines and has served on numer-
oris interracial commissions.

Speaking on the part and place of
the Negro in the American common-
wealth, nlr. Brown said, "The Negroes
came to this country one year betore
the Mayflower, They came to James»
town, not as religious fugitives but
as invited guests with their passage
paid.

Pushed Into Shiver,-

"The Negroes were pushed into
slavery because the white man feared
that the race would endanger this gave
ernmeot."

Speaking of the situation oi the Ne-
groes in the South today Mr. Brown
declared, ‘ here are Negroes in the
South today who do not know they are
free. The right oi franchise was sup»
posed to be safeguarded for them by
the Constitution but it has been tier
pi-ived them by grandiather clauses in
many southern states. ,The reason
that Negroes do not vote in the South
is not because or physical restraint but
because at these laws."

In working for his master’s degree
the speaker wrote a five thousand
word thesis on the subject of the
grandfather clause which he explained
as being directed primarily against
the Negro. The clauses are added to
the constitution and withhold thcr-ight
to vote irom all inhabitants or that
state whose lather-s ol' grandtatliers
did not vote

lliice mots Ilcsult

“Race rro » resulted from the tie—
pr-iving of the ght to vote lrom Ne-
groes who had lost 200,000 lives onthc
batileliclds or tlic Ci il War.

"The National Association [ur Ad-
vancement oi Colored People, laund-
ed‘by Mai-y White Orington, has done
more than airy other organization to
promote better rclntions between these
races, The oiiicers. like the meme
b; are ii-nni both races. A white
man is pr snleiit, a black mun vice-
prcsldcnt, a chrcw is sccreta and
a Negro is chairman oi publicitr l ,
oiiiigtoir is chairman oi the caccutivc
council.

“The N A, a, C P is not the only
organization for promotion or good
tooling," Mr, Brown added, "tllCl'e is
the Urban League which is bringing
about log ion against lynchi dc-
lrauchisenrent, and segregation.

"The reason given by whitc nicn lor
discrepancy agar t Negroes is that
they do it tor the protection at white

Migration of Negroes

to Liberia

Would Be Suicidal \to the Race,
Says S. Joe Brown‘ ill Interview

 

lly Joi- McKee

"There is nothing to the idea of
moving Negroes to Liberi , said Mr.
S. Joe Brown, prominent Negro attor-
ney and "Y" worker from Des Moine ,
when inter-viewed Thursday evening
arter the Y. M. C. A, meeting. "A
personal acquaintance of mine is his
hop of the Airican M. E. church in
Liberia. and he says there are splendid
opportunities for a Negro with capital
or a trade there. ,They need capital
and skilled labor.’

"Fur Negroes to migrate ‘en masse‘
to Liberia would be suicidal. Too
many Negroes are there without
trades and there are no charities in
that country to care for the indigent,

Liberian t'limnte Fatal

“The climate is almost iatal to Aln»
ei-ican Negroes, "The last Negro who
was minister to Liberia is m the Unit-
ed States now, broken rn health. One
Iowa Negro was appointed minister to
that country and while there lost his
health and died.

“it is not the ,natural inclination of
the American Negro to go anywhere
because all his ancestors as far back
as he has any recollection, were born
here and he iii going to stay and light
it out her-e

"A Negro was the pilot oh Colum-
bus' ilag ship. A Ncgro was the lust
to be killed in the Boston massacre.
My’wife visited his monument last
summer. Pirc tborrsand Negroes
fought in the Revolutionary War, sev-
eral thousand in the war or 1312 and
a nunihcr in the Mexican War. The
Negro troops bore the brunt of the
land lighting or the Spanish-Amer
War and also in the Philippine irr-
r-cctions. iiccnusc or these lacts they
reel they are as much, it not nrorc. Cn-
trtled to the benci‘its or this govern-
ment than any other group oi‘ people
on American soil,

Love Arum-ion

"They bchcve that Alliel'icd. is the
best couritr in the world and that
they have as much right to cinoy the
privileges as any group here.

“The discrimination against Negroes
in nmvsllzillcl' articles is deeply tell
by all colored people," said Mr, Brown.
“If it irrarr has one drop of Negro blood
he is colored and the newspapers
write at him as John Jones, color-ed.

”The word Negro is a proper noon
the some as Indian or any other racial
name, and should be capitalized

on

 

i
whenever used, Practically all Cul-

lege—bred Negroes have agreed to hav-
ing their-race called Negro,"

Replying to a que tion relative to
the Negro and labor, Mr. Brown said,
“The miners’ union is about the only
union be can loin. and a man cannot
work without being a member of a
rinion. The employers treat the Negro
all right but it is the other employes
who make trouble.

No Itriilway Employment

"There is not a Negro employed by
the Des_MoineS city Railway. The
company will employ foreigners who
cannot speak English but no Negroes.
It is just recently that Negroes werc
employed for railway maintenance and
that was mostly caused by the war."

sneaking or the legal status oi a
Negro in Iowa he said, "A Negro has
never been lynched in lowa; however,
there have been several white inch
lynched.

"The first decision handed dowir by
the Supreme court during Iowa-s ter-
ritorinl days was about a Negro, a
case something like the Dred Scott
case.

“The curse oi segregation ol Nee
gross is because the Zrccommodations
ior Negroes are worse than those [or
the white men The Negroes do not
want ‘L0 be with whitc people particue
larly, but we want what we pay 101'.”

Mr. Brown is a member of the Phi
Beta Kappa, honorary ‘scholnstic fri»
ternity, or Iowa Ci ,_ He was made a
member in 189s and was the only one
or his race in this state to be a mem-
ber until two Negroes were made
members at Crimicll two years ago,

Taught School

Mr. Brown received his high school
education at Ottuuiwn. He taught
.chool iir ii small mining town south
of Oslruloosa tor sever-iii years nttcr
his graduation train the state uriirei»
