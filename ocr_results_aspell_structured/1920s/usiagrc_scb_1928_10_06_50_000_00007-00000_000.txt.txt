The school which is closely re

history. The Grillllelleillecliina hold
is in the pro ince cl Shantung. it was
in this province that the Germans in
ms niider the pretext or wanting iur
demnity to the death or two German
Catholic p'r sts seized the port or
Tsingtau, They also wrung from China
concessions which gave them fir
claim on the mining rights or the
provinceand also the right to run a
thoroughly equipped German railroad

capital city. Tsingtu.

Planned in 1310

It was in this capital city that the
university which Lyman Carly. who
graduated from Grinnell in 1910.
taught. The _Grinnell-in-Chinn move-
ment was planned in 1910 tor arous-
ing interest among Grinnell people.
rfaculty. students, alumni and towns-
people—in the educational develop-
- ment of China. Three years later dete

inite action was tslten at Grinnell.
On Sunday. April 2 , 1913. designat-
ed as "Grinnellrihr hina Day" the
proposition was put hetore the col-
lege and church and the necessary
financial support was secured to put

 

it into operation. Work began at once
in the city ot Techow in the province
or Shantung. Work is being ()1 riod on
by the college under auspices or the
American Board of Commissioners loi-
Foreign Missions. \vliose headquarters
are in Boston.

Gl'lnnell supports the lower etlllmtr
tioual work at Lintsing. At Techow.
there are two boarding schools. one
tor girls and one [or hoys. supported

hundred students.

'l'llrt‘c Grinnell Teachers

Three teaching chairs in the Univer—
sity or Shahtung are provided by Grin—
nell. This institution was tormerly
under the supervision of English
Episcopal. English Baptist and Ant-
eriean Presbyterian churches. Grinr
nell responded to an invitation to
join in supporting the university,
which is at Tsiuantu. capital of Shaw
tnng province, hy providing tor these
chairs to be lined with Grillllell grade
hates. Shantung is the laregst Chris-
tian college in China in enrollment,
It maintains tour dcpartlnenls—libe

Financial support tor the lower eds
ucational schools is obtained iroin
(lriunell college. the Griuucll t‘ougro
gational church. and alumni and

friends or the college. It is estimated

that tom-'hundrcd dollars annually

‘will carry on this work

For the support of the lllfllltlr criti-
t‘zttiolltll schools. the home committee
voted to make {in attempt (0 misc
$100,000 as a permanent third. the one

(U. The American board for foreign
missions agreﬂl to raise hillboi that
amount for the higher educational
work in China if Grinnell would raise
the other half.

' intemationally Directed

The Grinnellrianhina movement.
is in the hands of two committees.
one in' Grinnell and the other in
China. The home committee consists
or represenatives from the faculty.
students. alumni and churches.

The school at Techow is divided
into two sections. one the chot‘i
high school for girls and the other
is the Porter high school lor boys. 1t

 

is interesting to note the history or
the Wycoil' school. One of the require-
ments for entrance is unbound ieet
In 1395. six girls were hrave enough
to unhind their feet alld enter the new
school. which was the first girl's
school in shantung province. It is . ill
the only school or its grade in a re-
gion containing 5.000.000 people. IL is
also one or the few schools from
which the girls may go directly to the
Union Women's college in Petting,

The dormitory. which is built ill
modified Chincsc architecture. houses
forty girls. For in on, board and
room the girls pay only twenty dol-
lars a year. hilt they do all or their
own work except cooking. One Cllie
nesc and two American teachers in-
struct the girls in all regular high
school subjects. including English.

A new school erected at a cost at
515.000. was completed in 1918. For
ntal calisthenics and basketball are
the chict athletic activities which the
girls enjoy.

Recruits ‘tor the academy come
trom six or eight small primary
schools located in the outlying (lis-
tricts. ‘

An interesting extract is taken irom
.llr. iiathew's letter to Air. Weln-han:
“School begins September 5. All ol‘
