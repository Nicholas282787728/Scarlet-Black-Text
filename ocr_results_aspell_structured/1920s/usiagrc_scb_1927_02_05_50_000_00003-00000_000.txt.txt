the subject of the address given by

night in the third of the lectures spon-
sored hy the social science departs
inents.

Dr. Steiner stated that Eastern Eur-
ope is the danger spot in the world to-
day. “The grant feeling at dissatis»
(action which is existing is due to the
provisions which the peace treaty
made. The men who drew up the
treaty can he deserihed iiy two words,
the last one is tools," said Steiner,
“the first one need not he mentioned."
The disorderly and upset conditions
have been caused by the improper rec
uiations or inroads and routes through
Poland and or borders throughout all
that part of the country according to
Dr. Steiner.

[when the plutarchs'

start plenum/2mg ,

AT THE night sessions, when class philosophers
vie with class Merry Andrews in deciding the
heavy problems of the world—or burlesquing
them —notice the royal guest, Prince Albert.
Chiming in with the spi 't of the occasion. Fill-
ing the ail: with the ﬁnest tobacco-aroma ever.

Do you smolse Prince Albert? It will bring
you more pleasure and satisfaction than you
ever thought a pipe could give. 'The instant
you throw hack the hinged lid and release that
wonderful P. A. fragrance, you suspect you are
in for some grand smoke-sessions.

The very first pipe-load conﬁrms your sus-
picions. Cool as a gate-tender. Sweet as the
weekend reprieve. Mild as the coffee in Com-
mons—mild, yet with a full body that satisﬁes
your smoke~taste completely. Get yourself a
tidy red tin this very day.

FRINGE ALBERT

—-no other tobacco is like it!
