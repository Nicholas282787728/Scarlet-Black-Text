IE WINTER
COMES

Some “Weather sharks”
tell us that we‘re in for a
hard, cold Winter,

We never saw one of
these “weather prophets”
yet that guessed it right
five seasons in succession,
however.

Anyway by the time
Winter is over everybody
forgets what the Weather
man guessed and once in it
while when he hits it he
gets the credit.

We remember in the
olden days when the finn-
ily horse put on an extrét
heavy coat early in /the
Fall, Dad used to say, .

“Well, Terl’s getting an
extra heavy cool; this year.
hooks illicit hhi-rl Winter.”

In any case it ill every
agesup‘fi'om season to sea-
son and we always need ‘rl.
good, wool dress, wool
stockings and warm gloves
to keep us Wal'm and com-
fortable. '

Buy nliw before the cold
wintry blasts blow
through the Campus 01‘
you will wake up some
lllornillg wishing you had
something warm to slip on
