the equal of the male contingent of
violinists who have come down the
Aucr line; (for she is one of the
galaxy of that great masters pupils).

Her playing has not the nan-less
technique of Helfetz. but she speaks an
unmistakably clear message through
the- medium at her violin. She has
something to say. and her audience has
no doubt that here is interpretive
surety and emotional sweep in no lit-
tle degree. There was haunting beauty
in her playing of the Kreisler arrange-
ment of a Cluck "Melodie."

Tone of Riu-e Beauty.

playing. particularly her pianissimo,

,“Pioneer Prudities”

With the outlines of the acts for
lthe coming show in the hands of the
Sigma Delta Chi committee. the "Pine
neer Prudities" has been chosen as
the name of the production. The name
of the show has little or nothing to do
with the nature or the entertainment
for the evening.

The one hundred dollars in prizes
has evidently produced action among
the scattered brain cells of the dor»
mitory and cottage residents. While
no definite information has been di-
vulged. the reporter was able to ga-
ther from rumors afloat today the na-
ture of the acts was thoroughly in
keeping with the spirit of the produc-
tlon.

Conversations overheard in Smith
hall and revelations from the key»
holes of Cottage Four indicate that
Margaret Weishaar will dive from a
twenty-live loot tower in a thlmble~
iul of water—unless she develops a
complication by that time. Arthur
msser will lend atmosphere. accord-
ing to report. by attending in the garb
of a life guard. The rest of this act
is as yet unascertainsd. but it really
doesn't matter anyway.

Very little is known about the L3n~
gan<Menrs act, except that the Lan-
gan quartet will not sing about the
dead roses. Building Three and Cot-

she will not do it juggling act with a
tray. its has been previously reported
to Campus gossipers.

Cottage Two will present a gene
ological piece entitled. “The Limbs of
the Family Tree.“ The boys of Dib-
hle will hilln the music—if they are
able.

There may lie some slight changes
in the acts before the final presentar
tions, but it is understood that they
are pretty definitely formulated along
the above lines. of course. the cen-
sors may have something to say about
ﬁlls—the show must not be too pru-

By 01d Nationalists.

With scientific methods of research.
the historian of today is l'esstudyllls
the past. such as the American color
nial era. in an effort to discover mu—
tives and facts to which the school of
historians prevalent in the last cen-
tury. with its well~intentloned but
narrow and nationalistic viewpoint.
paid little attention. This was the
substance of a talk on “Colonial His-
tol‘yiNew Style and Old" delivered
by Prof. Winfred T. Root. chairman
of the history department of the State
Univcr ' or lowa, at Herrick chapel
Wednesday evening. Professor Root
was introduced by Prof. Chas. n.
Payne.

"Historians are a product of their
times." asserted the speaker. "liese

ary thought, they otten overlook great
underlying movements They deal
with history as they desire to do so.
trying to explain it as entirely econ»
omic. moralistic or as the work oi
heroes as their individual tastes vary.
With the past filled with facts. events
and personalities. it is easy to (lot
this. The treatment which historiansl
have accorded the colonial period is a
good example of the varying wa s in
which different types of histo ians
will treat an era.

Presented Pl'(‘._ ldlt‘i‘ll Vi ,

“Typical of the first school of his-
torians who wrote about this period
is George Bancroft. who begun to.
write in the th es of the last cene
tury. America in his day was en
gaged in internal expansion and
strife. Democracy was sweeping the
country like a tidal wave. Hence
this man. who has spent years in
painstaking research. saw the colo-
nies as agents of liberty against eye
terual aggression. while in the shap-
ing of America he saws the workings
of a divine Providence. intensely na-
tlohslistlc. he read into the words ol
famous Revolutionary herocs thoughts
they never expressed, keeping up the
old grudge against Britain and refus-
ing to see that the courses of Europe
and America were inextricably inter-
Woven."

Pointing out that America's coloe
niai expansion and the great advances
in science have brought a new rllspem
sation in history in the last forty
years. Professor Root showed how
history is now being dealt with as a
body of scientific phenomena. His-
torical scholars are now interested in
the colonial era equally from the Bri»
ﬁsh and American viewpoints. it is
now realized that Americans may still
be patriotic and see where their fore

Modern Historians Must lie Exports.

“it is the day of the expert." de-
clared Mr. Root. "History now calls
not only for intelligence in its stu~
dents, but for patience. tolerance and
the power to see the events and move-
ments behind the written documents.

against these we must guard.

“It should not be forgotten that the
colonial era was vastly significant in
itself." said the speaker. "First, it

“No Final Action Has Been
Taken," Says Main In Ofﬁcial
Statement This Morning.

HAS CONFIDENCE IN COURT

Qharges Involve Total of Eleven
Men; Mass Meeting Thursday
Protest 01' Students,

“In the limiter of six students who
are being considered by the men‘s "
government of Grinnell college with
regard to infraction at the rules of
government. no final action has been
taken. The cases are still under the
consideration of the Student Court."
Such was the official statement issued
by President Main to the SCARLET
AND BLACK in an interview with the
editor this morning.

The President expressed his sincere
confidence in the ability of the Stu—
dent Court to justify itself and to
handle the case .properly. Referring
to reports of the affair in the daily
papers, he intimated that the news»
papers are bound to make sensational
anything which has little basis in fact
and that there is no cause for alarm.
The Men's Court. which has been
in session intermittently since Thurs;
day night at ten o'clock. is still meet
ing today. The governing body is ex-
pected to collie to some decision soon.
Starts With Freshman
The 'whole discussion started when
a freshman reported to the Dean of
men, James F. Findlay. that he wish—
ed to move out of Building Thi'eerbe-
cause of noise. resulting, it was al—
lcgcd, from parties at an alcholic nae
ture. Findlay presented the evidence
to the Men's Court Wednesday. which
body considered the cases and turned
them over to the facility because it
felt that there was insufficient evls
dence for dismissal, and yet enough
that the men'should not be complete-
ly acquitted. Ralph Barris. senior
judge of the Court, indicated in the
mass dieting held Thursday that it
was the intention of the Court to ap—
prove any aciion the faculty took.
Consequently the faculty took over
the case with the consent of the
Court. and from, further evidence
gathered. recommended suspension of
six men. Five others were involved.
However, the men students of the
college considered this action an abro-
gation of the rights of student governs
ment here, and called a mass meeting
at one o‘clock Thursday afternoon to
protest. George Gains presided at
this meeting.

Referred Book to Court

The senior judge of the Men's
Court thoroughly explained that
body‘s action, and a motion was made
to have President Main and Dean
ﬁnality explain‘ the action of the fac-
ulty. This was done by President
Main. and a motion was presented to
him to the effect that. in view of the
precarious situation in which student
government hcre was placed. the mat-
ter should be referred back to the
student Court. This was done through
a committee or students meeting with
the faculty that afternoon.

The faculty action was suspended
pending further investigation by the
Court and the students were reinstat—
ed until this further action should be
taken by the Student Court. which is
expected to come to a decision soon.
