[IEDINSIIY HAS HIIPES
IDS RUSSIA’S IUIUIIE

Russians New Expressing Selves
Politically In Place of
Art and Dancing.

“Russia is a country, not of the
past, but of the future,” said Miss
Elucia Dedinsky, instructor in French,
at a meeting of the World Fellowship
committee in the “Y" rooms last night.

“The Russian people are now ex—
pr .,ing themselves politically. where-
as they used to give themselves to art
and dancing," she said. “The Hus
SLU) women decorated the outsides of
their houses with beautiful designs.
They embroidered without paper pat—
terns, but with designs from their
hearts.

“Tile men made impromptu songs
to the tunes of their halalaikcs and
carved beautiful things trom wood.
Perhaps that is all ended, for hair the
people can express themselves politi»
cally."

Nihilists Mill].

“The nihilists were mild people,"
Miss Dedinsky stated, in speaking of
this party, the anarchistic socialists,
and the terrorists. ”They were his
fluenced by Darwinism, and thought
that Russia should evolve from autoc-
racy to democracy. The anarchistic
socialists urged the peasants to seize
the land from the wealthy land own:
ers. The terrorists believed that ne—
gotiations could bring no reforms, and
that the officials should he terrorized
into submission."

The end of the nineteenth century
marked the rapid progress of indus—
triolism, with the building of factories
and railroads. '

in 1927, Nicholas Ii, the last of the
czars, u overthrown. “It is said,"
Miss Dedinslfy stated, "that just as
Russia suffered under the czai-s. the
more intellectual classes are now suf-
fering under the autocracy of the
peasants.”

Miss Dedinsliy feels that Russia is
in a state of transition, from which
something ﬁne will develop.

TURKEY REVELS HOLD STUDENT IN

GRINNELL OVER

While most of us were acquiring
avoirdupois at the family‘s festal
board, a certain cotcric remained in
Grinnell tor the Thanksgiving recess
to revel in that peaceful solitude which
descended following the departure of
the l:lt, the 4:30, the 5:02, the 6:17,
and ’the 10:20, to say nothing of the
llidnight Flier. at these uiifortunates
there were three classes who remaincd
to haunt the campus: those who had
neither wealth nor passes, those who
live in such far distant districts as
Minnesota and Nebraska, and some of
the famous campus-couples who had
seen so little of each other during ex-
ams.

The social calendars ol‘ tliesc exclu-
sive groups could be rivaled only by
the ponderous date—books of the metro-
politan elite, Commencing the festivi-
ties, and of chief importanceicullnalu
ily and sociallyiwds the sumptuous
repast served in the sacred refectory,
Thursday noon. The honored guests
were seated at long tables which were
embellished with shining silver, beau-
tilul china, and gleaming linen, and
goose: To say nothing of the cherry
in the cocktail (fruit)!

As for the guests themselves, they
were unbelievably taciturn, and kept
wondering all through the meal whe-
ther, after all, there was anything to
he thankful for. This lent to the love
ous spirit of the davimol'e or less.

In the afternoon a new type of Mora<
tlion contest was instituted among

THANKSGIVING DA

Crinnelrs traditions. It w . listed on
the calendar as a tea, but really turned
out to be a contest for the consump-
tion of pineapple sherbeiiand after
such an enormous dinner too! The
faculty were invited to join in the
tray, and from all report they li-
nished well or. their fronts.

Because of the vacation and the kind
permission from the League Board,
Circle Hall reported a marked lies
crcase in attendance. Dear League
Board! Is not forhldden fruit always
sweetest?

Sunday noon the dormitories re
turned the courtesy oi a monthly
meal to the quad-dwellers. The obr
iect of the game, as was afterwards
explained, was to see who could finish
eating first. These speedball demons!
But they were IlnSniit’lhleieVeu to the
last lingering sip of coffee!

In addition to all the social festivir
ties. several grnuches were assumed.
personal ehniitics were threatened,
and a few suicides were contemplated
fall because of too constant associ-
ation with other incarcerated souls.

And then came the real heroes! For
the truly brave were not those who rc-
mained here to gorge upon Crinncll
delicaciesibut rather those who re-
turned at the crucial moment and res-
cued half-dead carcasses from chan
dclicrs, squclclied the bitter feuds, and
(Ilengoh such bravery as this took!7
proceeded to describe every minute dc-
tail of their own Thanksgiving feasts!

Hold Iowa State Eleven to Score
of 14 to 0 In Spite of the
Dope to Contrary,

LOCAL DEFENSE STUBBORN

Hill Proves Spectacular Player
For Ames Team Instead
of Captain Weiss.

The Grinnell Pioneers ended their
football season in a blaze of glory No-
vember 19. when they held the highly
touted Ames Cyclones to a ii to 0
score. Ames was favored by most
of the sport autho ' es to dcteat Grin-
nell by a margin of anywhere from
twentvflve to forty points.

The Pioneers presented a stubborn
defense, and therCyclones were unahle
to register a ﬁrst down till late in the
second quarter. Ames scored in the
second and last quarters on marches
down the ﬁeld. In these advances,
however, it was not the much-feared
Ames backs who scored hut “Red”
Hill, speedy sophomore substitute nalf~
back who scintillated. Hill was aided
by some good interference, and this,
coupled with his speed, enabled him
to get off fairly long iaunts around
the Grinnell ends.

_ Weiss Boxed.

Captain Walter Weiss, whose re-
turns of punts have been a feature or
the games which the Cyclones have
played, was completely boxed in by
Fall, Davis. and Liedtke, and could
run back but twelve punts for a total
of ﬁfteen yards. Lludbloom, whose
plunges have been the feature of the
season was stopped completely by the
Grinnell forwards.

Twice during the game, Griunell
backs were loose with only the safety
man between them and a score, but
each time Weiss, diminutive Ames
quarterback rose to the occasion and
tackled his larger enemies.

The most spectacular play of,the
game was when Hill returned the
kickoff opening the second half toi-
sixty yards. He was pulled down by
Evahu, however. and Grinnell held for
downs and took the ball.

Erlillli, Davis Star.

The Whole Pioneer team showed up
exceedingly well, with Evahn‘ and
Dltvis starring Weiss. Ayres, and
Hill appeared best for Ames. Iowa
State gained a net yardage of 235 to
170 for Crinnell. . Ames made ﬁrst
down ﬁfteen times to seven for Grin-
ncll. Both teams averaged forty yards
on punts, and Ames gained ﬁfty-four
yards on four passes to loi-ty-nine
yards on three passes for Grinuell,

Harri:ﬁ Speak
At Y. M. Tomorrow

Talk To Be Based on Paper to Be

the part of those who heard him last
year, Dr. E. E, Harris h again been
secured by the Y. M. C. A, to speak
to the men of the College Thursday
night in the clubroom of Building
Three at 6:45 o'clock. '

"Dr. Harris is one of the few na-
tionally recognized authorities on
psycho-pathic and psychoanalysis
work. He has written several papers
on the cures of psychiatric problems
concerning college men.

The talk which Dr. Harris will give
will be based on a formal paper which
is to he published in a leading maga-
zine lii a short time. it consists of a
discussion of actual cases of college
men and women where some problem
or inhibition has clouded the mental-
ity, thereby making their work impos-
sible and their lives a source of pain
and mental groping in the dark,

Dr. Harris has had students of Grin—
nell college under his care at various
times. He will have some interesting
facts to bring out concerning the his-
tory of these patients. After the talk,
an open forum will he held, giving
those present an opportunity to ask
him questions.
