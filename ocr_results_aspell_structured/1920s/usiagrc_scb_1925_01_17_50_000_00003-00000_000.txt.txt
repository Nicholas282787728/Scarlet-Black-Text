lowed.

The revolution was on, Frntricidal
bloodshed was averted by the action ot
King Victor Emanuel III, who refused
to sign a. decree declaring martial law,
accepted the resignation of the gov-
eminent. and summoned Mussolini to
Rome to form a new government. Since
October 30, 1922, therefore, the Fus~
cistl have been legally in the saddle.
They have consolidated their position
by an election based on a new law by
which the party securing the largest
vote in the country is assigned a heavy
majority of the seats in Farlisment.
The Fascisti saw to it that this vote
went their way.

Mussolini’s government has attacked
many difficult political and economic
problems, with at least partial success.
Communist Violence has been sup
pressed, and strikes. which were a
chronic nuisance and peril under the
former regime, have been prevented,
though wages have been lowered and
the deflation of the force of public em-
ployee ths begun. Expensive special
privileges, such as free passes, have
been abolished, and the railway and
other public services made more effic-
ient. Hawy taxes are being collected,
and a. balanced budget is in sight.
Price fixing {or agricultural products
and other protectionist measures have
been repealed.

In short, Italy has apparently been
“saved." Then why the Widespread
reaction against Mussolini, even \n
quarters Where he was hailed as the
savior of his country?

Brutal methods require brutal men,
and a. dictatorship cannot well deny
the violent means that have made it
possible. Riding rough-shod over the
constitution does not train the riders
for a return to constitutional methods
Not only local ”bosses" raised to [laws

Fascist revolution, but inch high up
in the organization and close to Mus»
solini, have been involved in continued
violence and bloody crimes. The most

spectacular or these was the rcvoltlng‘

murder of the Socialist deputy Matte-
otti last year. The conscience of the
nation has been deeply stirred by
these events, and Mussolini has not
succeeded in washing his hands of
responsibility for them Thus his
enormous prestige is at present much
shaken.
