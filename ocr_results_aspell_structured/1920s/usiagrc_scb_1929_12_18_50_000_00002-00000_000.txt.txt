SU'AEI'ER SCHOOL AT GRINNELL,

In another column of this issue the plans for a
summer session of Grim-tell college are discussed. The
SCARLET AND BLACK Wishes to commend this ac-
tion as a forward move on the part of the administra-
tion.

School in Grinnell throughout the summer under

the suggested plans should be most attractive and
should interest many students. We believe ir will
offer a greater opportunity for individual initiative
than the ordinary schedule.

Before this innovation the college buildings have
been empty and useless throughout the summer .
valuablc only for church conventions. It seems much
better from an economic standpoint that this property
should be used the year around.

Each summer finds a large number of Grinnell
students enrolled in other institutions. A summer
session here would doubtless bring the majority of
them to Grinnell and would materially simplify the
countless problems shifting registration, grades and
credits entail.

The summer session wiu also offer an opportunity
to Grinnell graduates who are taking addi onal work
to return here and take that work under their former
professors, to whom they have become adjusted in
previous years, and under whom, therefore, they may
be expected to do the most creditable work. While
many of Grinnell’s professors will undoubtedly be else-
where next summer, yet the point just mentioned
will be true in many cases.

We believe the plan for a summer session to be
in accord wrth Grllmell’s general ’guiding policy of
continuous advancement and again wish to heartily

commend such an action.

BAND ACIIVITYl

During the half—time intermission of the Grinnell—
Marquette basketball game, the college band presented
a program the uniqueness of which makes it deserving
of comment. The program consisted of two roLher
long pieces, Amina, a classical hit; and Americans We.
a march. In the latter, the band instead of playing
throughout, started the march on their instruments
and then at certain sections stopped playing and car-
ried the piece through by singing in unison.

So far as We know, nothing like this has ever been
tried at a basketball game before and even had the
execution been faulty. which it was not. it would have
been interesting as an experiment,

That not everyone appreciated the work which
had gone into both pieces might be surmised from
the attention which reserve basketeshooters seemed to
get down on the other end of the floor, and the occas-
ional comment on the part of some spectators that
classical music had no place at a basketball game.

However we, as part of a minority, (if minority it
is) who feel that good music is appropriate at any
time and in any place would like to thank the band
for their efforts last Saturday evening and express
the hope that the ambitious schedule started at the
Marquette game will be continued.

It is written in an amateurish, ex-
pository manner; but it represents
all who have been freshmen. and we
are glad to see it.

Among the poems, "The Guest" by
Ruth Atwater is delicately musical.
Helen Kingery's sonnet “To One Old-
er” is full of meaning and fceling,
which causes one to re-read and pen-

“Raisin Muffins” is a pleasant
story. The description of the small
town is poor and sketchy; but therg.
are delightful snatches, such as the
incident of the frolicking tumble-
weed.

The editorial, motivated by Arthur
Ponsonby's “Falsehood in Wartime."
is written in rather sensational jOur—
nalese terms, but one recognizes its
sincerity and the importance of its
theme.

Jack Woodford, “who has centric
buted to more than sixty magazines,"
is responsible for “Introduction to a
Novel," a rather clever and super-
ficial condemnation of realism. Such
epithets as moron, imbecile, and
trained flea rattle vacantiy through
Mr. Woodford’s paragraphs.

The T nager is best and most dise
tinctive hen it represents a number
of Grinl'iell college writers. The Jan—
uary issue is a pleasant example.

Relativity Is Topic
of Science Meeting

"The purpose of relativity." Grin-
nell Dunbarn told the science club
Monday evening, “is to state all gen-
eral physical laws in terms common
to all observers.” Dunham then
pointed out, as the two reel moving
picture also showed, that as physical
laws were stated by Newton they

would be false from the point of
view of an observer far off in inter-
stellar space. or of one moving with
the speed of light away from the
earth.

It was pcintcd out, for instance,
that a projectile shot straight up
from the earth and falling straight
down would seem to an observer on
Betelgeuese to describe a curve. To
deal with such phenomena adequate~
ly, Dunham stated. Einstein has
found it necessary to define gravity
in terms of the space medium.

The films, incidentally quoted Ein»
stein as declaring that there are but
twelve men in the world who could
understand his redeﬁnitiolls.

Davis Greene, in the second talk,
reported the results of recent experi-
ments on crucial phenomena involved
in the new theories.

One development which Einstein
predicted was soon observed to be

true. The apses of Mercury’s orbit
are moving a few seconds per cen-
tury around the sun.

‘ Another expented observation was
the so-called bending of light rays in
proximity to large bodies like the
sun. Astronomers observing stars
almost behind the sun during the
total eclipse of 1919 discovered these
stars not quite where they expected
them, but exactly Where Einstein had
predicted they would be.

A third prediction which has not
yet been verified concerned the
“crowding" of the red end of the
solar spectrum.

The practical implications of re-

.lativity. the club members were told,

have not yet been guessed; neither
were the implications of Newton's
laws in his time.

The next meeting of Science club
will be January twentieth. The
chemistry department will in

THE SEASON’S ' GREETINGS

'I'E

Truesdole.
Editor. the Scarlet and Black,
Dear Sir:

It swms to me that the college
band has thrown itself open for a
little constructive criticism follow—
ing last Saturdays basketball game.

At that time, as you probably
know, the hand rendered an overture
which was excellently done and in
that respect there is no room for
criticism.

However, may I ask why it is that
the leader of this band believes that
the gymnasium is the place for a
classical concert? If the bend
wants to continue as the main source
of musical inspiration at the Grinnell
college basketball games, it would be
wise to discontinue this present pole
icy of slow and far from invigorating
music.

There are plenty of good, peppy
marches to be found and it is abso-
lutely unnecessary to fall back on an
overture. If it is impossible to find
good marches and fighting songs to
last through a season, let the band
broaden out a hit and play a few
modern, popular numbers.

Yours for a better musical policy
at the future athletic events,

Jim Morrison.
