Clash With Smith Hall
Saturday—Freshmen
Play High School,

with the issuing of a challenge by
Building Three that they would meet
any two buildings lo a game of root-
ball thero loollts up the possibility of
inter dorm football this fall. Smith
Hall has already accepted Three's
challenge and the two buildings will
lneet Saturday morning on Ward field.

Last night saw bililding lln'ee’s
squad reporting for practice. They-
took a iigllt workout and brushed up
on that old high school football
knowledge that many of them have
forgotten. Only men that are not ollt
for varsity or freshmen football are
eligible to play in the dorm teams.

Nothing deflnite is known of the
strength of the varioii, tcalns yet but

rumor has it that Building Three Will .

have the class of ‘he game Satin-dd
Those outlast night for Building
’1" on were Baumiln, Irwin, Evans,
Falley, Froumg, Herbrcclltsmcyer,
Bill Macy, and a number of dark
horses concerning whom Building

Three refuses to give out any infoi-»

iilation..

slnith Hall has not had any wol~~
outs yet and they are unable to give
any information as to their squad but
they said they felt confident of giving
Three a hard game.

Frosh Scrimmage High School
Gl'ihnell lligh came up to hard
field Monday night and scrimlnaged
the freshman for fifty minutes, durr
ing which time the freshman scored
one touchdown, the only time the ball

'as shoved acl ss either goal line,

During the fi st half of the scrim-p

image the high school appeared to
have the best of the game and the
freshman were forced to kick coll-
tinuaiiy to gain. But at the start of
the second half the yearlings buci-led
' down and displayed some real ability
in smashing the high school's lino.

Men were substituted freely by both
coaches and the scrimmage was taken
in the nature of a checking up oi e
rors in both teams formations. nodl
coaches welc allowed on the field and
coached their men throughout
contest =

\Valtels Stock, 1 ngelv, and John-
son did good no , for the h'cshllmil.
The entire soiled hows the effects of
good hard work and they will prove
a valuable asset to Coach Saunders
for varsity next fall.

For the high school Rivers, the
Lamb brothers, and Capt. Saunders
worked well. The high scilool has a
very strong team gnd will show up
well in the state standings.

That the dining service at the dor-
