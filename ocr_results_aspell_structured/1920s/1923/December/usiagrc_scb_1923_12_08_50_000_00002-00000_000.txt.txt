Tim QUESTION OF GAMLLW

Remarking that college students are
being charged with wholesale gamb-
ling on football games, a certain Iowa
paper says, “This is only natural in a1
way. Football is not played for the
sport and the recreation, 1t ls a com-
mercialized arteir and the fame is a
lite and death matter. The problem
is to win at any price and the fruit
naturaUy is gambling. it is just like
the old time horse race,"

Such an indictment, it true, would
mean that football has been lowered
to the level of boxing, wrestling, and
other commercialized sports, where
doubtful methods are used to bring
victory. Yet we should be inclined to
doubt the tact that the average etu-

‘ressienal baseball playerl

‘tliis betting is done by the some set]

bility ol’ \\'inl.llllg money by doing 50.,

And again, we should doubt the usser-‘
tion that iootball men do not play [or

The fact that there is betting on
football games Cannot be denied, yeti

The percentage of students gambling
on football games is Small, and the ELS-
SEI‘UDI] that college football is a, 90m-
mercialized aliair is groundless.

LITERARY SOCIETIES

For several years there has been a
noticeable decline in the attendance
at DJEDE' literary socitles. With this
decline in attendance, there seems to

were specdcd up somewhat
yesterday when Mrs. l-lclcn Tal-
boy, tield secretary of the lawn
brunch oi the association, come here
to copier with members of the locnll
committee on the pious to be made.
llrs. Talboy's special mission was
to emphasize the necessity of capital-
izing on the impetus of lur. Colhy’s.
speech in an effort to crystallize pro-
League sentiment into some tungiblc
toI-m which can he used in the com-
in; election.

“I don't-care how much League of
Nation sentiment there is hanging a-
round loose," declared Mrs, Talboy.
"unless there is some form of organ-
ization which will make it otiective."
Mrs. Tolboy further stated tout the
objects or the Association were two-
rold; iirst, to get the United states
into the World Court; second, to get
a plank in the party platforms at the
next presidential convention which
declares openly for the League. "N0
Footherbed Resolutions" is the motto
oi the Association in this matter. Its
eitorts are to force political parties
to take an issue on the Court and
the League and not a court or a Leav
gue.

Everett Colby. the man who will tell
Grinnell people all about the plan for
world organization, is a practical pol-
lticiau who can present that side with
authority. He was a member oi: the
Republican National Committee in
ltlie presideotal campaign or 1916, and
has held various other political of-
iices at various o‘mes. In 1911 he
visited England to familiarize himselr
with the workings of party machinery
in that country, and took part in the
parliamentary campaign or 1911, He
has served as a special investigator
for Hoover on the European iood
situation, enlisted in the aimy in the
World War as a private and was hour
orebly discharged with a major’s com
mission ilr. Colby returned recent-
'ly lrom Europe where he attended the
lost session of the League of Nations
lat Gnneva, His political and travel-
ling cxperieuce should entitle him
to respect as onc who lmows his sub-
iect thoroughly.
