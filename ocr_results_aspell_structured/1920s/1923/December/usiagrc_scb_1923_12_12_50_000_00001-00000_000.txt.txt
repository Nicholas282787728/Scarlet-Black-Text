Schedule For 1924 Practically
Identical With That of Pres-
ent Season,

If early indications amount to any
thing, the Grinllell football eleven of
1924 should be the best since 1913, and
should seriously threaten every team
on their schedule.

Forum“ Leitcr Men

The early indications are extraor-
dinarily promising. They are so
promising that they have already been
the cause of a good many enthusiastic
discussions on the campus. In the
first place, the material for the squad
has Probably never been so marked
by quality and quanity as the prospec-
tive material for the 1924 squad. At
the read of the list naturally comes
the fourteen letter men in the grid-
iron sport. It is evident that from
the number of letter men alone, at.
least three of them will be forced to
watch the game from the sidelines.
But in addition to these men, and the
men on the varsity squad this fall,
there Will be a host of men from the
class of 1927, anxious to test their a-
bility in varsity competition.

(‘ritchctt Good Captain

The team will he led by George
Ci'ltchett,‘ who was elected captain
of the 1924 team at the close of the
season this year. Critcheti‘. plays in
the backfield and his ability to kick,
drop- k-ick, pass and carry the ball
makes him an ideal triple threat
For his teammates in the backfield.
Critchett has Wing, sweet, 0. King-
ery. and Jones.

Scharnwehcr, Winter, and Taylor
are also letter than playing on the
forward wall. Duke and Wood have
both successfully played tackles, and
their two years of experience will
make them especially valuable next
fall. Moyer and Grimes both won
their letters this year at the center
position. Grimes has had two years
of varsity experience at this position
while Moyer was a newcomer in var-
sity ranks this season, Dare and
Cathcal‘t will back to plug up ire line
at gards. These men won their let-
ters at guard positions during' the
season just closed.

Prep Material Good

The recruits from the freshmen
Show exceptional promise in the back-
field. Meeter, Good, Hays, Johnson,
Niblo, and Moran are all good men
who will make the veteran varsity
men fight for their jobs. A number
of men have also played a fine game
in the line this fall in scrimmagcs E.-
gainst the varsity eleven. Among
these are Alberson, Braden, A. Lar-
son, Meythaler, Peterson, Rose, and
Weitz.

Coaches Return

The coaching combination
Worked so well during the last
games this fall will probably be
operation throughout the entire 1924
season. Elward will take care of
the‘ backfield men and coach the team
on the offensive. Hyland indicated
at the close of the season that he
will instruct the line and Work on
the Pioneer defensive.

Another element very favorable to
the 1924 grid season is the pep and
spirit of the student body. Begin-
ning with the Coe contest, the stud-
ents and the backers of the learn ex—
hibited an unfaltering, wholehearted
support to the team which battled in
their honor. This support was shown
in the face of defeat. With a. Winning
team, it would be different to tell
what Limits the enthusiasm of the
student body would go.

‘ Schedule Nair Completion

The schedule for the coming year
will be approximately the same as
the schedule of 1923. , Games have
already been scheduled with Ames,
Drake, Washington, Cole, and Creigh-
ton, subject to the approval of the
local athletic committee. Negoti-
ations are being made for contests
with Cornell, Parsons and the Kan-
sas Aggies. The greatest amount of
interest in centered on the Coe and
Drake games, since the Scarlet and
Black have been unable to snatch a
victory on the gridoron from these
schools for several years. Early in-
dications are tarovable to turn the
trick in 1924. At any rate, it is
more than probable that the Pioneer
team of 1924' Will surpass the one of
1923 in number of games won, number
of scores made, and in its ranking on
the football field.

Chairman of League of Nations
Non-Partisan Asociation
Speaks December 15.

Riding on the crest of a Wave of
public opinion favoring participation
in international affairs and set in mo~
tion by Miss Sarah Wamhaugh, the
Reverend Mr. Sidney Strong, and Gard-
ner Cowles, it would seem that Everett
Colby, chairman of the executive com-
mittee of the League of Nations Non»
Partisan association, should he as-
sured of a receptive audience when
he speaks in Herrick Chapel at eleven
o'clock Saturday morning.

Objects.

The objective of the association
which Mr. Colby represents is three<
fold: First, to secure approval by
members of the United States Con-
gress of the World Court proposal;
second, to secure the insertion in both
the Republican and Democratic party
platforms of 1924 of a plan favoring
entrance of the United States into the
League of Nations; third, to attempt
to realize international good will in
this generation. Coming just prior to
a. national presidential election the
campaign of the association is vitally
concerned with an issue which is of
common interest to every voter and
anyone even slightly interested in the
problems of our administration.

John H. Clarke, former Associate
Justice of the United tSrttes Supreme
Court, is perhaps the most ardent
supporter of the ideals of the associa-
tion. He resigned his judgeshlp in
order to devote the rest of his life
