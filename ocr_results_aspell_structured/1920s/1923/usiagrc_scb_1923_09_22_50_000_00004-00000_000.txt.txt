This is the time of the year when business feels the pulse of the approaching fall trade.

Stocks are fresh and new.

The assortments are complete. All the latest and best offerings of the fall season await the attention of the discriminating

buyer.

Grinnell merchants are especially proud of the showings which they are making this fall.
ransacked for the articles which give the patrons of Grinnell stores the best values for their money.

With this in mind the Commercial Club has arranged 3. FALL OP:
“window shoppers” will have an opportunity to look over the offerings.

 

The markets have been

ENING for next Tuesday evening when the
ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS are invited to

 

 

attend. These displays are not only in the windows; they are in the stores and they are for sale.
Come down town Tuesday Evening and see the windows.
