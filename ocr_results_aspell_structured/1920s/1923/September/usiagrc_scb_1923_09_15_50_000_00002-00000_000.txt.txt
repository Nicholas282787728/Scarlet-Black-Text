HOSPITAL INSURANCE

Five dollars spent for hospital in—
surance offered by the Grinnell Com—
munity hospital, is one of the host in-
vestments that a college student can
possibly make.

Occasional illness is the lot of ever-y
man and woman, Those who hoast or
perfect health may find themselves
lacing a hospital bill of several hun-
dred dollars heforo the end of the
year. Now we’re not protessionai
crepe hangers, hut sickness is no res—
pecter ot men, and it’s true that ﬁve
dollars in insurance may save you a
hundred later on. And i: you never
have to use it, you should he so hap—
