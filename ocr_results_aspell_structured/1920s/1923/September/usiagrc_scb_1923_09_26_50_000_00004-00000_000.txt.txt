He is the new acting chairman af’

the English department.
born in Chicago in 1532. After grad-
uating lroln the university there,
he acted as n newspaper reporter in
Springfield, Ohio, taught at Marshall.
Illinois; held an instructorshlp at the
Univel‘sity'oi Southern California, and
at Harvard, where he received hll

lie was

doctor's degree; and was granted it-

traveling fellowship which sent him
to Oxiord last year.

He is the only man living who has
voluntarily returned to down from
Los Angeles. After being closely
connected with the educational insti-
tutions in California, in Massachusetts,
and in England, Mr. Wood is glad
to come to one iu the Middle West.
for he says. it seems like going back
home. or the various types of higher
education he has seen. he prefers the
English method in some respects. but
does not consider it adapted to demo-
cratic types of education. In the
west, Mr. Wood notices u pride in un-
conventionslity, a freedom from n-
stl'aint, a ldcli of subtle tradition, and.
in general, a less conservative spirit
than is lound in the New England
university, where older npd more set—
tled traditions, and the careful pre-
paration for entrance to college, make
for a more specialized form of edu-
cation and more conservative ideals,
Grinncll. which he admires tor the
policy of education to which it holds
itself, falls somewhere between the

twc~it has the unconventlouelity of.

the west, but somewhat of the college
tradition or the the east.

His interests are diverse, ranging
from tiout ﬁshing and Rugby foot-
ball to the minor works of the Neor
classical period of Engilsh literature.
(extending from the lust part of the

seventh through the {list part of thel

eighteenth centuriesibe calm, the
reporter didn’t know it either) which
wns the subject of his doctor’s disc
sertation sud has hecn his main line
of work lever since. Naturally enough.
his chief interest lies in wife and two
little daughters, who havc recently
arrived here. Grinllell students, and
trout fishing take second place.

Parlors Sunday Night

VS DO YOUR WORK AS YOU
WISH IT DONE.

We are here to please you.

Very informal cottage parties were
held in Cottages Two, Three, and
Four last Sunday evening, in the
respective cottage parlors.

Music, including piano, ukeleles.
'and group singing. was a feature of
each party, and refreshments of lolly-
nops or popcorn and apples were
served, enjoyed particularly by the
girls who are taking hygiene points
this fall.

This type of informal Sunday night
party is one of the most popular
methods of bringing the girls in one
cottage more closely together, and
these three parties will probably be
lfollowed by many others during the
rear.
