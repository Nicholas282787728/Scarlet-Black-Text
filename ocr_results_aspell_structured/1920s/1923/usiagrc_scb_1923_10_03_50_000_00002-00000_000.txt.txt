The Scarlet and Block's suggestion
tor a possible reorganization oi the
Council along these lines can he
stated under three main heads.

First, let. the Council be composed
oi committeernen {mm the men's and
women‘s government.

Second, let the Council be so organs
ized that committeemen train the
the corresponding committeenren from
the Women’s government.

Third, let the Council. be reduced
in size if possible. It only the chair-—
men of committees from the two hasic
systems oi government had member-
ship on the council, it would then be
a body that could be easily convened
in which the lines of responsibility
would be open and direct. But size
is not the most important consider-
ation.
