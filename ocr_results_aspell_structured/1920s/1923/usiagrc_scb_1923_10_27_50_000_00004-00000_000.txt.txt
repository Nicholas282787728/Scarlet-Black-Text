GBINNELL‘S GREATEST HOME-
COMING.

Today is epochal in the history oi
Grinncll. It witnesses the greatest
Homecoming that our college has ever
staged. The program has been mould—

our institution has ever before at-
tempted. An intinite variety at events
has been built around the central in
terest ,of Homecoming, the Drake-
Grinncli classic this afternoon.

Grinnell meets Drake tonight over
the banquet board, in the reception
hall, on the ballroom floor with all
the cordislity that mutual interests,
reelprocsted and friendly
competition can evoke.

We want to become better acquaint.

ed with our friends from Des Moines,
and urge them to partake liberally cf
Grinnell’s hospitality. There is name

gentleman. Today’s experiment in
inter-collegiate tellowshlp could not
have been a success in the middle
ages We doubt it it could have been
completely successful ten years ago.
But it eon ho successtul today.

Alter Bulldog and Pioneer have

the contest have been sold, and by
game time it is expected that every
seat in the grandstand and the extra
bleachers will be occupied

Immediately after the game the Col-
