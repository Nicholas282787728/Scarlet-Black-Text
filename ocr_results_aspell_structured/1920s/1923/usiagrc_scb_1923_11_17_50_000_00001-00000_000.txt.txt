‘Awes Audience With Formidable
Program Executed,With
Skill and Beauty.

' HIS coming preceded by the laud:
atory comments oi the world‘s press,
Emil Telmanyi, Hungarian violinist,
proved himseli to be an artist oi iirst
rank in his concert last evening. Not
only was he an experience to be re—
membered, but we believe that upon
his shoulders has fallen the mantle
oi Kubelik.

Mr. Telmanyi chose ior his pro—
gram works that are iormidahlc to
the most accomplished oi violinists.
Mendelssohn's Concerto in E Minor
iormed the major part oi his program.
To it Mr. Telmanyi gave the iull meas—
urepi his genius. There was elo-
quence in his intervention. and with
it technical perieotion.

Audience is Awed

At the close oi Bach‘s "Citations” the
audience was hushed. They had
witnessed a miracle. Mr. Telmanyl
had made oi a composition which is
ordinarily incomprehensible to the
average person, a glowing creation.
,His ilueucy oi bowing, precision or
attack, and the transcendent beauty
oi his playing made this composition
a thing to be cherished and remember
ed. ‘

The latter part oi the program in-
cluded a iarh iar Chopin Nocturne
played with iinisb and purity oi
tone. Beethoven's Turkish March
was given a brilliant rendition. A
novelty, ”Zephyr," by Hubay. exhibit
ed Mr, Tellnanyi’s virtuosity.

The accompaniments oi Hubert
Carlin were cicellent throughout. Mr.
Telmanyi was iortunato in securing
as an accompanist a pianist oi such
marked ability.

Physiology Class to
Conduct Science Club

The first student meeting or the
Science club will be held in Blair
hall Monday evening at7115. The pro—
gram will be given over to the physi—
ology class which has been experi-
menting on a considerable number oi
tame white rats and domestic pigeons
to study the problem of practical 1-m—
trition.

tied out in the course of the evening.
There will he on exhibition nus which
have been injected to show the rapid

The program will be in the nature
oi a demonstration and the talks will

In an interview with Coach Elward

the Kohawks, niward said, “The men
have a gleat deal oi coniidence and
they are not in the least dow-n heart-
ed. No one ought to be down hearted
after hearing Hawk's speech in chapel

better. He has lots oi iight and can

The team will be hard hit by the
