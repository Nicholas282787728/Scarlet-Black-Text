A howl MANAGEMEN"

With this issue at the Scarlet end
Black a new management assumes
control and responsibility. The trans.
itiun, which is iormally completed tar
day, has been more gradual lrhan
abrupt. For the past two weeks the
present editor and business manager
have been publishing the paper underl
the supervision or the retiring man—
agement. We are glad to take this
opportunity to thank them sincerely
for their thonghrul suggestions and
helpiul guidance. Withuut their as<
sistsnce, we could not have prepared
ourselves tor the task which con—
cronts us.

As the change of management has
not been violent, neither is any radi—
cal departure in policy contemplated.
With no personal interests to serve,
and none to suhserve, there is but one
goal at the end of the road tor us.
Th’at can be simply stated. It is to‘
continue the attitude which the Scar»
let and Black has maintained

Grinnell."

Thai. may seem no more than a glit-
terlng generality. Yet a moment's
contemplation oi the Scarlet and
Black's history during the last three
years, {Dr example, is ample proof
that its ideal can be translated into
the language or every day life.

to face that handicap zit the start, an—

they are beginning to master it.

In spite of this handicap, which is
not our peculiar let alone, and with
the assistance of a staff that is both
able and energetic, We will do our
best, not only to keep the Scarlet and
Black up to that standard which

won for it, nut to take some little step

Foster Rlnefort will comprise the

which will make the tr'lp to Ames to-

Rinefort is the only member of the
squad who is likely to score points
in this event." He puts the shot, toss-
es the discus, and is also a. classy
Sprinter. With any luck at all he
should break the state record in the

there were no pretty coeds and would

chosenris very unattractive.
