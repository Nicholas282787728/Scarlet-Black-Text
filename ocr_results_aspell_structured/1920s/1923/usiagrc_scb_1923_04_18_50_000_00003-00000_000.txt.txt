Williams’ VII
—the softest course in colle e

ILLIAMS’ VII is a course for every man in the
institution. It’s seven times a week but the ses-'
sions are short—less than ﬁve minutes each. And best
of all, no man who elects Williams’ ever fails—to get a

i better shave than he ever got before. ,

The ﬁrst thing you lean n in shaving with Williams’
is of the lemnrkahly beneﬁcial effect it has all your skin.
You can t fail to be impressed—even after the closest
examination vith the fact that here, at last, is a shav-
ing cream w lch reallydoes your face good.

Then especially if you‘ re of a practical, business
like turn of mind, you ll be
pleased with the efﬁciency
of Williams’. It softens the
board in so much less
time It does Everything a
shaving cream is supposed
to do.

mohths. See then if you ever
could go back to any other
shaving cream.
