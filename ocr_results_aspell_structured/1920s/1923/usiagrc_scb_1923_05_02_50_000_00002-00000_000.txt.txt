There’s no‘ “wrangling” necessary to get a
lather with Williams’ Shaving Cream. Squeeze
out a sp'endthrift’s dab or a tightwad’s dabAit’s
all the same. Either way you get a big, efficient
lather that softens the beard right down to the

And best of all, this big Willinms’ lather has
a decidedly beneficial ‘
