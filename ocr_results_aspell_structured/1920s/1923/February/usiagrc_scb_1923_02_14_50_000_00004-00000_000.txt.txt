lIILUIIINI SONG MAKES
BIB Hll IN ﬂHIﬂAEl]

Received by Audience More En-
thusiastically Than Any
other Song.

Tile lcaturc oi the Glee club contest
in Chicago last Friday evening as-
‘col'tling to reports brought back by
members oi the Gi‘illllell club, was the
spontaneous enthusiasm with which
the Gl'inllell Alumni song was receiv-
ed. Almost helore the closing strains
oi “Come ‘10 Back to Chi Gl‘innell”
had ceased to sound through Orchestra
liall, 2500 people made the auditorium
:ring with their spontaneous applause
which drowned out the staccato "Grills
ncll We Yell” oi the peppy but small
group oi alumni in the Center, or the
hall.
I Applause tollowed the singing or
other school songs. but it was chielly
the applause which is always itccurﬂr
ed to performers as a matter ot court—
esy and not that enthusiastic outburst
which can not be restrained; only the
alumni oi schools were enthusiastic.
But the Grinnell Alumni song instill—
ed the whole audience with a ieeling
which made it impossible tor them to
restrain themselves, and. as one mem-
ber of the club put it, they iairiy “got
up on their ieet and yelled."

Composer There.

The Grim-tell club is especially
gratitied since Mr. William B. Olds,
the composer or the song and the

founder of the Grinnell club. was in,

the Chicago audience and witnessed
the enthusiasm with which his song
was received. Aiter hearing the song
sung last night he said that never he~
iore had he heard the Alumni Song
sung as well, and never hetors had
he realized all that it meant~ s
musical value and how ellective it
lculild he when sung in the proper
'spirlt.

I The song so appealed to the audi
once that numerous people asked
where they could get copies or it.
it was this same song which was sung
at the University Club on satnrday at
the special request or men who had
no interest in the college beyond the
tract that it has a Glee Club and a
song which can make them tool the
spirit oi Gl'lnnell as keenly as if it
were their Alma Mater. .

| To the director of the club, Dav-id
E. Peck, is due the credit ior bringing
out all the musical value oi the song
and the ability oi the club. To the
,alnmni is due the credit ior instilling
yin the members or the club that spirit
which enabled them to sing the song
with feeling, From the time the men
ireaClied Chicago until they left tor
,home the members oi the club were
royally entertained by the Chicago
alumni.

Final Examinations-
Go Into Effect At
Purdue Next Year

Starting with the school year 1923-
24, all Purdue students will be re-
quired to take onal examinations in
each subject they are carrying at the
end or each semester.

Such was the result oi a vote oi the
iaculty at a meeting held May 4, 1922.
A committee was appointed at that
time to see it the idca could be put
into practice and to plan the working
details oi slarting the new system.
The committee submitted its report
to tho iacnlty meeting. After a. tow,
amendments had been made, the report:
was accepted, and exams will become
a reality next year. , '

The last two weeks ol‘each semester,
will be takenup with examinations
each oi which will last three hours.
Not more than two exams will he ﬁvenr
on any one day.

The eilect on the semester grade.
will be in accordance with a. sliding'

scale. Next year the examination
grade will count twenty per 'cent. in
1924-25, the value oi the grade will be
twenty-ﬁve per cent. The (allowing
year it will count thirty-three and a
third per cent. Alter 1926, the value
will remain the same—one-thll-d.

Purdue is practically the last of the
prominent engineering schools to
adopt the semester examination sys-
tem. other well known technical in-
stitutions rave required examinations
201- some time, and have no trouble in
administering exams in technical sub-
ﬂeets.
