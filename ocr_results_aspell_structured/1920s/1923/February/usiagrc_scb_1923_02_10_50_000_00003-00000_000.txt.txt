1. Believing that overcoming the
]soothing hatred of the world with

ithc church, We urge the ministers and
lcburchcs of iowa to make the matted
their ﬁrst concern. ‘

We suggest that our Iowa church

Liug that thcyydcfing with other tier
lnominzttions, may so organize the
[Christian sentiment of the world that

ation to prevent 'war.

3. Allore all,,a world where in.
tcrnatioual good will has driven out
national and racial hatreds.

ii A spirit of righteousness, good-
will and brotherhood in Ville United
States which shall 'lay the founda-
tion or a just and lasting peace iu
