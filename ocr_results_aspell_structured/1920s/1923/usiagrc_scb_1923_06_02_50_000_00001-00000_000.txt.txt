Off Again, On Again,
The Championship ,
Has Changed Again

Disregarding the result of the last‘
game played between buildings Two
and Three for the baseball champion-
ship, Conch Elward has decided that
Building Two will retain claim to nrst
place. ‘ ‘[

Since tie games do not 'couut in the
average, the championship is award—
ed to hangan because oi the fact that
the Langanitcs had four victories and‘
one tie game hr their credit at the end
or the series, campared to Three's
record of three games won and two,
tied.

it the decision were to be awarded
in any other way it would be neces-
sary to play off all tie games, and
because oﬁ the few days remaining of
the school year, this is practically
impossible.
