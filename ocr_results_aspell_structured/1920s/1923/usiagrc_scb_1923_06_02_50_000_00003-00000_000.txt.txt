James II'is Dead—
NEWTON Lives

ITSHEBIMIIIHAHUNS

,' T has always been known
that free bodies fall. The
earth has a strange at.
traction. How far does it
extend? No one knew before
Newton, sitting in his garden, one
day in 1665, began to speculate.

“Why should not the ltuaction
of gravitation reach as far as the
moon?” he Inked himself. "And
ifso, perhaps she is retained in her
orbit thereby." He began the cal.
culation, but overwhelmed by the
stupendous molt that he foresaw,
hehad tobegnfriendtooom.
pletc it. - .

.In Newton’s Principl'a were laid
down his famous laws of motion
—the basis of all modern engineer-
ing. The universe was proved to
be a huge mechanism, the parts
of which are held wgetner in ac.
eordance with the great law of
gravimdm.

James II ‘wns reigning when

the Pﬁnn'px'a appeared in 1687.
He is remembered for the Bloody
Assim ofJeﬁ‘reys, for his complete
disregard of constitutional libero
ties, for his secret compacts with
Louis XIV and the huge bribes
that he took from that monarch,
and for the revolution that cost
him his crown; Newton is remem-
bered because he created a new
world of thought, because he en-
abled scientists and engineers who
came after him to grapple more
effectively with the forces of
nature. '

When, for instance, the Research
Laboratories of the General Elec-
tric Company determine the
strases set up in a steam turbine
by the enormous centrifugal forces
generated as the rotor spins, they
practically apply Newton’s laws in
ranching conclusions that are of
the utmost value to the designing
