when they let it be known that theyl

of Mrs. Knapp on Tuesday morning:
before il'iends were informed of the;
event. l

Mr. and Mrs. Knapp will be at home
after February lst at the Jacobs
Apartment at 1026 High,

Mr. Knapp has more than made
good in his newspaper work, Start-
ing his career as reporter on The
Herald and litter going to The Regis
ter, where he now holds the position
of managing editor. He gravitated to
the newspaper business as naturally
as a. duclngrztvitates to Water, after
his graduation erm high school here
in 1913. He has developed into a
ready writer- nnd an expert and. un-
tirlng news hound. His raver-its out

The Herald stsrr counts him one of its ,
dearest rivals and unites in con-'
gratuisﬁons and. best wishes for a
happy and prosperous future. Mr.
Knapp is the Son at Ml‘. and Mrs, W.

The bride is tile daughter of Mr.

Both young people have ilusls of

 

trying to ﬂy. They [had

not troubled to discover

what Solomon called "the way of
r an eagle in the air."

In 1891 came Samuel Pierponc
Langley, secretary of the Smiths
sonian Institution. He wanted
facts. His ﬁrst step was to Whirl
ﬂat surfaces in the air, to measure
the air pressures required to sus-
tain these surfaces in motion and
to study the swirlsland currents of
the air itself. Finally, in 1896, he
built a small steam~driven model
which ﬂew threequarters of a
mile.

With a Congressional appro-
priation of $50,000 Langley built
a large man-carrying machine. Be.
cause it was improperly launched,
it dropped into the Potomac Rivcr.
'Years later, Glenn Curtiss ﬂew it
at Hammondsport, New York.

Congress regarded Langley’s
attempt not as a scientiﬁc experi-
ment but as a sad ﬁasco and

General

gentral Office compan Srhcntc!ady,MX

refused to encourage him further;
He died a disappointed man,

Langley’s scientiﬁc study which‘
ultimately gave us the airplane
seemed unimportant in 1896.
Whole newspaper pages were given
up to thc sixteemto-one ratio of
silverxo gold.

“Sixteen-to-one” is dead polit-
ically. Thousands of airplanes
cleave the air—airplanes built
with the knowledge that Langley
acquired.

In this work the Laboratories of
the General Electric Company
played their part. They aided in
developing the “supergharger,”
whereby an engine may be sup—
plied with the air that it needs for
combustion at altitudes of four
miles and more. Getting the facts
ﬁrst, the Langley method, mad:
the achievement possible.

What is expedient or important
today may be forgotten tomorrow.
The spirit of scientiﬁc research
and its achievements endure.
