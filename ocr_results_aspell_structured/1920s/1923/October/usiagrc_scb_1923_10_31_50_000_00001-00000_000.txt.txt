great interest and full of argument»

hurt should he l'e-nomil-lhted on the
Republican ticket to the United States

The Crinnelii football eleven suffer
cd it's worst defeat in many years last
Saturday afternoon when it fell before
Drake university, 41 to 0, on Ward
iieid. a large Homecoming crowd
witnessed the game.

The Bulldogs took advantage of sev—
eral breaks in the first quarter of the
game to help them‘ score three touch-
downs. Scores were also registered
m each of the three remaining per—
iods. Orcbaugh made five of the six
attempts good on placerkicks after
touchdowns, one kick being blocked
by a, Grinnelll lineman.

Captain Boeiter won the toss for
Drake and received Taylor’s kick on
the three yard line, returning the ball
twenty yards. Neither team was able
to make ground through the line for
the first five minutes of play, and
several pants were exchanged, On
the lftst of these punts, Drake blocked
the Crinneil kick and recovered the
bail on crinncll's eight yard line. A
series at tackle plays then netted

Window Display and Small Boy
Vendors Aid Circulation of
Last Malteaser.

An unusually large number of copies
of the Homecoming issue of the Mal-
teaser was distributed last Saturday.
The magazine was given a window
display at Bates‘ drug store, and nor
merous small boys sold it on the
streets and at the game. Their cries
at “You need a Maltenser" were heard
and taken been of by the visitors.

From the clever cover to the reviews
of new books, this number was ﬁlled
with new and entertaining features.
Blanche Wilson's drawing of several
of the faculty was particularly notes
worthy. Other contributors were
Jessie Ba‘ldwi , Paulinc Crook, Dorr
Yeager, Richard Steiner, Emil Bilbarz,
Robert Fell, George Harnagel, Harry
Reynolds, Howard Backus and Annie
Spatz.

Those, who by their peculiar reac-
tions‘toward women and love, are
branded as freaks in one way or an»
other, were urged in an editorial to
present their thoughts on paper for
future publication.

tions in the Quadrangle drawing-room

SRINNELL WINS SLIP
IN SIIINI RRNIESI

Freshman Drill, Klan Gathering
And Honor Cr Pageant Win
Trophy Over Drake.

One of the new and spectacular fear
tures of this year's Homecoming was
the stunt Contest between Drake and
Griuncll, staged between the halves
of the football game. A cup, pur-
chased by the two schools, is to be re<
tallied each year by the winner of the
stunt; and as the officials of the
game awarded the prize to Grinnell,
the local athletic department now Dos-
sesses the trophy.

Drake's Stunt was a, clever satire
on Gi'innell's football team. A com-
pany of saxophonists after pr ming
them selves with oil, romped merrily
down the field for a touchdown, mid
the shrieks and catcalls of their wail-
ing instruments. After the touch-
down, the players rendered it couple
of quite creditable saxophone numbers,
led by Ray Harrison. Grinnell won
the piize on the Combined merits of
three stunts; a. drill by nine [resh-
nlen, It gathering of the Ku Klux IﬂP-u
which viggnmusly “ducked Drake.“
and a pageant 'put on by the girls'

lRNMRAIJER’S GLASS
SIIIESINREE PLAYS

Comedy, Fantasy, and Tragedy
Guarantee Variety for Pro-
gram Nov. 17.

The class in dramatic production,
under the supervision of Professor-
Trumbauer, will present three one—act
plays November 17th. The program
is well rounded, and promises to be
unusually interesting in its combina-
tion or comedy, fanta and tragedy.

The ﬁrst of these is "Wul'zel Flum~
lylei'y” by Alan Milne. Rich in good
characterization, and replete with
rievcr lines, the whole effect is onc of
amusement and lightness. The comedy
arises over the fact that to two men a
huge sum of money is the best excuse
in the world for doing the ridiculous.

This play is being directed by Bar—
bara Davidson, and has been cast as
follows;

Robert Cranshaw, a rising politic-
innilVallaCC Witmer.

His wile, a poor deal-7V'elm2t Bissel.

love~Frank iller.

more than thatihcl'nard Craven.

lire} mborg Fantasy Chosen.

Under the direction of Harriet Rust
another play is well under way. This
is “Manikin and Minikin" by Alfred
Kreymborg. Full of gentle rhythm,
this play is just as odd and dainty as
the two iitle bisque ﬁgures which speak
in it. They are portrayed by Elin
nbeth Reynolds, as Minikin, and Ralph
Hall as Manikin.

Work on the third play, “The idol
of the Shops”, by Goodman and Hecht,
has been delayed. its rehearsals will
start as soon as the cast is completed.
Several more men are neded, and any
men wishing to ﬁll these vacancies
should see Professor Trumbauer by tor
moi-row noon if possible. '

Ada Eeckman is costuming these
three plays. Harvey Waugh has charge

hoped that by such action the list will
approach the 100% goal.

The support of the student body dur-

over 70% of the student body.

SIX NUMBERS RIISKEI]
ERR LESIIIRE SNNRSE
SIIIE SREAI NARIEIY

Subjects Range from Events of
the Day to Pro-Historic
Life of Man.

SEASON OPENS NOV. 12
WITH SARAH WAMBAUGH

Poetry, Science, Philosophy, and
Political Science Are
All Included.

With six high grade numbers al<
rcndy booked for the coming lecture
course season and several other pro-
spective attraction in view, every indi-
cation points this year toward one of
the most interesting and profitable
lecture course programs ever present-
ed in Grinneil.

The numbers selected deserve es-
pecial interest because of the fact that
they run the gamut of human inter-
est. Authorities ob prehistoric life
of six million years ago will vie with
speakers on contemporary affairs in
their attempts to catch the interest
of the Grinnell audience.

Poetry’ and science, polities and
philosophy will he presented, not sec-
undrhantl, but by those who have
written their own poetry, evolved
their own schemes of philosiphy, and
contributed in person to the political
experience of the world.

Opens November 12

The season will open November 12
and 13 when Sarah Wambaugh, a writ»
er and authority on international
duesctions, will come to Grinnell fresh
from a European observation trip,
where she has been making an espec-
ially intensive study of the League
of Nations. Those who have heard
Miss Wambaugh attribute to her an

‘unusuul ability to put iiic into sill..-

l'ects of a political nature which on
the surface appear rather forbidding
to the average reader.

Edwin E. Slosson, the author of
“Creative Chemistry,” will be here
January 11. Undoubtedly the power
of self expression in a simple and
direct style which Mr. Siosson is one
of the literary editors pf the Inde—
pendent abd a member of the Columr
bia University faculty.

Tells of Prehistoric Life .

Arthur Sterry Coggeshall, director
of Education of the Carnegie Mus-
cum, will deliver his famous lecture.
"Hunting Big Game in the Rocks," on
January 16. Mr. Coggeshall makes
the boast that he can tum back the
clock six million years. He makes
his promise good by bringing to life
for us the prehistoric monsters of an
age far beyong that of history, and
until recently beyond even the scope
of science. ' ‘

Two Authors Booked

On February 22 S. K. Ratcliff, Eng-
lish lecturer, publicist, and author,
will be in Grinnell to tell of contem-
porary affairs, personalities and
movements. He will be a decided as-
set to the program,

Bertrand Russell should need no in-
troduction to a college audience. His
outstanding work as a publicist, es-
sayist and philosopher have won for
him an enviable reputation in liter-
ary and scholastic circles. His up»
pcarancc on Eeburary 25 should be
one 01' the great events of the college
year.

By way of ending up the season in
a slightly lighter vein Lucille ﬁnch
has been secured to present her Manic
my stories aund unpublished negro
spirituals of the Old South. She is
said to have an almost uncanny ability
to set before her audiences the negro
of pro-Civil War days. She comes
highly recommended by such men as
W. D. Nowells, Arthur Brisbane and
others.

Inasmuch as the lecture course is
not a money making enterprise but
one for mutual enjoyment and hens»
fit, season tickets are being sold at
the low price of two dollars to adults
and at half price to those of high
school age and under, it bought in
single admissions. this ticket would
cost over five dollars. ‘

An especial effort is being made
this year to put enough publicity in-
to circulation before the lectures so
that their merits may be weighed a-
head of time. He who misses a val-

uable number Will have but himself
to blame.
