Despite the uncertain weather that
settled on. the eve of Grinnell’s great-
est Homecoming, the town and college
have been transformed over night into
a veritable Mecca for football fans and
alumni from all parts of the state.

The early arrivals began to trickle
in Thursday night and it is expected
that the stream of Homecoming pil~
grims will swell into a torrent by
noon today. Every train disgorges
its burden of old grads and ex-stud-
ents. All roads lead to Grinnell.

From every indication Grihnell‘s
first real Homecoming in [our years
will be marked by the largest crowd
that has ever assembled in the Scar—
let and Black Camp.

Dmke Comes in Special

The Drake special, scheduled to ar-
rive at one o'clock this afternoon, is
expected to bring the bulk of the
Drake delegation, including the var-
sity, the faculty, and students. Ac-
‘cording to arrangements just an~
nounced, the Grinnell College Band
"and the entire student body will meet
the Drake rooters at the station and
then lead a parade to Ward field.

Advices from Drake suite that
enough more Bulldog backers plan to
come overland to swell their numbers
tq the 1200 point.

An impromptu parade after classes
yesterday revealed the baud resplend-
ent in. it’s new scarlet and black cape
uniforms.

The two day celebration was offici-
ally ushered in by a monster Del?
meeting last night at which enthus-

iasm reached the point of frenzy. "To ,

the Ladies" followed at the Colonial
theatre before a house that was sold
out thirty minutes after the seat sale
had opened.

Full Program This Morning

Athletics in all forms will' be the
program this morning. There will be
three different athletic contests held
before noon. Drake and Grinhell will
compete in both tennis and cross—
country during the forenoon.

The third feature of the morning
program will be the football game be—
tween two teams chosen from the
large Freshman squad of gridiron
warriors. These two teams have
named themselves the Blacks and the
Blues, and are expected to stage a
hard fought contest, as they are even-
ly matched.

At noon a stag luncheon compli-
mentary to the Freshman football
team will be held in the men's din-
ing room. All Honor C alumni are
particularly invited to attend.

Drake Mentor

Ossie Soleui

Ossie Salem, head of the Drake foot-
bail. staff almost tutored the Pioneers
six years ago. Dssie came down for
spring practice in 191‘? but joined the
service before the fall work began.

He has had coaching experience at
Minnesota, his Alma Mater, and
Luther college. Drake recently sign—
ed him up for five more years. Ossie
has practiced law in Minneapolis,
but he iinds the lure of the gridiron
greater than that of the court room.

Solem religiously observes all the
superstitious practices of the coaching
fraternity, as well as c few of his
0W1). Today he jingles a pocketful
of lucky coins to frighten away the
evil spirits.

Before the Oklahoma game, the
last one on the Bulldog schedule, he
will toss a flaming cld shoe over a
goal post on the Drake Stadium. That
will ignite a bonfire around which
Ossie will lead his proteges in a
whooping war-dance. This is guaran-
,teed to put the skids under any jinx
that might otherwise trail his warriors
to their last game.

by the fighting spirit which he has
instilled in his pioteges He has Won
the confidence of the entire collegei
and the devotion of every (Inc of his:
men.

Elward balls from Notl’e Dame and
consequently knows football from a,
B, C's to the other end of the alpha—
het. He has worked unceasingiy, not
only on the gridiron, but in a thousand
other ways to make Grinncll victor-
ious today.

He is known as a fighting Irishman,
and lie can carry his fight from the
scrimmage field to the speaking plat—
form. After he gets through talking
at a pep meeting, the air is saturated
with enthusiasm. i-iis fire and de-
termination are contagious. The en—
tlre school has succumbed to an at-
tack of Elwardism. .

He lives football. He has put his
heart and soul into the game this af-
ternoon. Whichever way the tide
of battle turns, Grinnell knows
Coach Elwarrl has given to the ut<
must.

Grinnell Team Lauded
By Minnesota’s Coach

A recent letter to the Scarlet and
Black from E. W. IverSOn, Minnesota
cross country coach, lauds the con—
duct of the Pioneer distance men who
competed against his team last Satur—

“1; want to express my appreciation -
of the way in which the Grinnell
team conducted itself in the ﬂeet with
Minnesota," he says in part, "Our
boys delighted to compete with a
group of athletes such as represented
your school here last Week,

“We hope to have your team and
ours meet again every year, if Dossi-

 

hie."

Two rivals of long standing will
meet this afternoon on Ward field at
2 o‘clock when the Pioneers face the
Bulldogs in what promises to be the
hardest fought and most interesting
game an the Grinnell schedule for
many years.

Ever since the first or the football
season, both the Grinnell and Drake
squads have been pointing to this
contest. The game this year is be-
ing played at Grinnell for the first
time in many years. This is the most
important event on the homeconb
ihg program and it is estimated that
four to five thousand students, alum»
Di, and visiting Drake supporters will
watch the contest.

’l‘nylor Returns

Grinnel] will go on the field this
afternoon with a team materially
strengthened by the return of Taylor,
who was injured in the Washington
clash two weeks ago. Taylor is a
valuable man at left end, for he is
fast, a good kicker, and he can nab
passes in sensational fashion.

His teammates on the left side of
the line will be Duke at tackle and
Wood at guard. These two men are
letter men and have proven their a-
biiity in past games. Captain Nich—
ols will be the mainstay of the
right wing. Winters and Dare, who
have youth bad varsity experience, will
play end and guard respectively.
Grimes will start the game at the
pivot position. With his huge size,
Grimes is counted upon to do much
towards making the line a stone wall

’ on the defensive.

New Combiuah‘on Sm
Coach Elward is starting a backs
field combination, which has never
appeared against the Drake team be-
fore. E. Kingery‘is to start the
game. at the quaterhack position,
which has been the weakest spot on
Grinnell teams for the last three
years. This afternoon will furnish
Kingel'y an excellent opportunity to
show his generalship. The team has
confidence in Kingery and every
man will fight throughout the entire
game with him directing their efforts.
Wing and M. Smith will play the
halfback positions. Smith is taking
the place left vacant when Critohett
was injured. The naturLof his in-
jury will not permit Critchett to don
the moleskins this afternoon. Sweet,
star on the freshman team last Bea-
son, will hold down the fullback. job.
The kicking for Grinnell will he
done by Taylor and E. Kingery. At
punting, Taylor is the better man,
while both men can be depended upon
to dropkick. Scharnwehei- will also
assist in the kicking if he should get
into the game. _
The open date of last week has per-
mitted Drake two full weeks in which
to prepare for the Grilmell contest.
