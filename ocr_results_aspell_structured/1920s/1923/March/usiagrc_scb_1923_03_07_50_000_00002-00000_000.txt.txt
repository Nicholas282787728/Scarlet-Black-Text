DRAMATIC CRITICISM

The rather satirical”
quoted from the columns of the Scar-
let and Black under the Caption, “Dra-
matic criticism as practiced in our

colleges." We wish to borrow the idea
and revise the caption to "Dramatic
criticism as practiced in Grinuell,"
and quote iron: the columns or the
Gi-iiinell Register:

"Homer Abegglen tool: the leading
male role, and his work was of a high.
order. In the supporting cast were
Paul Cloris, Lucile Kepiord, Stanley
Talbott and Winifred Parker and all
deserve praise tor praise-worthy perr
performances. The part which was
originally assigned to Miss Grace
Kutish was taken by Miss Kathryn
Jones and although she had only a
short time to prepare for it her per-
romance was remarkable.”

This quotation is practicauy half of
the story, and the rest is devoted to
general remarks about the
night, that the play itselt possesses
real merit, etc. Evidently the dra—
matic critic 02 the Register tolled to
use his "comps" to “The Famous Mrs.

not in the least dispai-agingly oi the:

work of Miss Jones.
Criticism of an amateur play is an

extremely difficult process to Carry
out. But a criticism of a college play
which was considered important
enough to put on the front page
should be accurate at least in regard
to the persons playing the parts. And
we consider "The Famous iurs. Fair"
worthy of definite praise, at least
more than the hrooioiilc statement to

the effect that "he took his part well."

"11E BASKETBALL SEASON!

Another athletic season has slipped
into stanstics.
yer it cannot appear to have been
very successiul. And judging by the
standards at the casual observer, vie

team’s success is judged by its rankv

ceuiage column remain as the mute

story of the season’s victories and
defeats.

Granting that such an opinion is
not without grounds, we must mains
thin that it is but half the story.
A team should not be judged by the
number 0!: games won and lost, but
by the number 0ﬁ_ games in which it
played up to the ‘best of its ability.
To go down fighting to an honorable
defeat before a. stronger adversary is
to be preferred to winning a ragged,
slip-shod game from a weaker team.
The success or failure of our basket—
ball team should be judged by this
standard. We may be proud of our
quintet in the exxact measure that
they represented Grinnell to the best
of their abilities.

It is true that there are a few dark
spots in the past season that we are
glad to forget. Sometimes it seemed

Harold Mathews of Class of ’16
Writes to Cross of Difficul-
ties of the Language.

Harold Mathews, no, who is teaching
in the language school in Peking,
sends in _a letter to Mr. E. w. Cross
somei nterestiug information concerm
ing the Chinese language. He says
that the hardest thing about the Chi-
nese language is the tones, three or
four words with the same sound with
slightest change in the pshrdelaoin
diiiei-ent meaning
slightest change in the pronunciation.
For instance, “Hsieh” means "to rest,"
“thank you," “shoe," "to write."

"There has been many excellent

I might tell you about but the one I
wish to mention here is Admiral Tsai
of the Chinese Navy, educated at All-
nnpolis and a thorough student of the
philosophy of LaoTze, the great sage
of the Sixth century B. C. All I can
do is to repeat a few of Laotze’s Daro—
doxical sentences which will give a
little cue to the man‘s spirit, Laotze
said: “They can kill my body but they
can not kill my soul." “Be in harmony
with the intelligent, be in sympathy
with the lowly," "A great man never
feels great. a small man never feels
small." "The people are difficult to
govern because these above them are
too selﬁsh, The people are hungry be-
cause those above them have too
much." Socialism is not such a new
idea as We sometimes think. '

BALZAC’S
POTTERY

Some years ago the novelist
Balzac curbed his celebrated pas»
sion for grapes tor a Whole
month. With the money saved by
this deprivation he purchased
two pieces of pottery that had
taken his fancy on the shelves
of a. Parisian Gift Shop.

Pottery that is as beautiful
and perhaps more practical than
Balzaa's can be had today With-
out such heroic abstinence.

Our complete line of Rilper.
Weller and Belgian Lustreware

exquisite pieces.
