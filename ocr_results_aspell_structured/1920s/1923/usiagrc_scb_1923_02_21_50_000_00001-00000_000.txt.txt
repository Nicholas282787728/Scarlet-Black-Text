and Benz from Scoring
Field Goals.

The Pioneers won their second
basketball game of the season Satin»
day night when they defeated the
Washington team by the close score
of 22 to 20, after being behind at
the end of the ﬁrst half 13 to 9.

Grinnell deemed to win because
of her superior team work and has—
ket shooting ability, although they
nearly lost the game on personal
tools, 15 of which were called on
members of the Scarlet and Black
clan.

The work of lfinuer, who is the
entire Washington team, kept his
team in the running until the last
two minutes of play. when he was re—
tired on personal fouls. Although the
Pikers only scored two field goals,‘
one by Thumser early in the game,
and another by Neiss, who substitub
ed for Minnel', the free throwing of
Minner kept the Red and Green in
the running.

The tie between Building Three and

unbroken to date with only one more

games, Building Three took two
games from Smith Hall by forfeit.
Clark Hall defeated Building Four in
two games and mpgan Hall won

a pretty goal. Minnel' made three‘

With Washington leading 13 to .9.

closely guarded Saturday night that
he could not get a free shot tor a
ﬁeld goal, although his free shooting
was the deciding factor in the game.
Gelvin and Critchett showed up better
than at any time thi season, and

In his speeches, Mr. Libby makes
the point that it is now that war can
be abolished; that ten years ago it
could not'have been abolished and
that it will be impossible to abolish
it in ten years hence: “It is the one
problem of our time," he said recent-

Unique Features in
Program for Annual
Ball Next Saturdayl

The annual women's Colonial Ball
which is to be held in the men’s gym-
nasium~ next Saturday evening, Feb—l
ruary 24, promises to be one at the'
best the girls have ever staged. Plans
have been completed for all the tradi-J
tlonal features, such as the rye and
the firefly wallzes, and the mlnuet,
which is to be danced during the inter-
mission by the W, A. A. Board, in ad-
ditoin to which several new attrac-
tions have been arranged.

The most unique of these is the pre-
sentation of a George Washington's tea
party, in which some of the children
of Grinnell will he the actors. George
Washington, in one of his lighter
moods, goes with a group of his gen-
erals and high officials, to pay a visit
to the future Martha Washington, and
she and her friends servo tea and cake
to the gallant gentlemen.» This is a
distinct departure from the usual pm-

as a legacy to our children. I agree
with Major Gen. John F. D'Ryah who
says, ‘The American people can end
war in our time if they get on the
job,’ and I agree with him also when
he says ‘I should be a traitor to my
country if I were not doing all f can
to a polish war.’ May America he
the country which will dud the way to
rid the world of War. The way to
bring this about is to see to it that
our government, Congress and the
Administration devote at least some
part at its time and energy and your
money to solving the war problem.
At present their chief work toward
that end is to prepare for the next
war."

Senator Bur-eh made this point in
Congress on December lst “We
shall expend this year, Mr. President,
for war purposes, s2,nso,ooo,ooo: for
:ngrlcllltllre, 's 76.000: tor public
