parts included Alice slngham as
“Adl'ienna;" John Kemmerer ss
“Noah" Alphonse Champonier as
"Monsieur Briquev—il‘le" and Dorothy
Wilson as “Madame Lebreton.

The play was cleverly done and
had been brought up to a high stand-
ard under the direction of Prof.
Lehel-t. The title or the play figura-
tively means "Cupid At Sixty,” and
the signiﬁcance the re-swztkening of
youthful teslings sud emotion in an
old man. Noel, a young Frenchman.
mmles Adriene, a girl much below
him socially. Monsieur Briqueville,

Inter. himseu. runs in love with the
girl when she comes to his home in
the guise or a maid. Embarrassing
complications arise, all of which are
straightened out with the arrlvsl or
Noel.

The play was done in French and
was well executed both in pronuncia-
tion and acting. Mildred Cohen as.
sistod in the directing.

Lucia Roggman played a. pleasing
piano solo, "Arogonaise" from “be
