Finally, it creates unnecessary ma
chincry on government “That govern-
ment is best which governs least" and
one which gets results with the mini-
mum of machinery is the most to be
desired. As a matter ol met, one in
which there are a number or nominal
oi overlapping committees can not be
as eiticient as a system in which the
machinery is leduced to a minimum,
with every part or the machine having

If we are to judge by past experi—
ence, a number or the Council's com.
mittees do little except get appointed.
There is the traditions committee and
the pep committee, so called. We are
not seeking to exist any reflections
upon the newly appointed members of
these committeekwe are speaking ot
the activity, or rather inactivity of
these committees in the past. The

Izmit is not with the personnel,

Take, for eaxmple, the recreation
committee, which is a really import-
ant and active committee or the Colin-
cil. But why ammint an entirely new
,body to handle our rec hours?

not the men's Senate have a social

ate with a similar committee from the
women's government? And would not
this committee be in closer touch, not
only with what the men and women
want to do and with what they can
do, than any third body? Thus two
committees could take the place or
three. A social committee for the men
and a social oommlttes tor the women.
and these acting together for both.

Such an arrangement could not help
'hut be more efficient, because it. would
bring direct co-operauon between the
men’s and women’s governments, and

system that are interested in the same
line of work, This would eliminate
any unnecessary committee and would
greatly clarify OllX' system of student
government.

In a similar manner, joint conir

NE reason alone that the Parker

Duofold is invaluable to students
is because ﬂuent writing induces ﬂu-
ent thinking! You can't compose your
thoughts if an unruly pen barrios your
brain. But Duofold‘s balanced swing,
its super-smooth point, its ﬁt and
business-like feel inyour hand, all give
yam- mind free rein!

Ask your student friends who use
this classic pen ~they'll tell you they
would ratherlet go of seven dollars than
have to part with the faithful Duofold.

Its over-size inl: capacity holds a
long-distance ink supply. And its point
is not only smooth as a polished jewel,
but no style of writing can distort it;
hence, a pen you can lend without fear.

Students call it the “All-American"
Pen because it’s the ranking favorite
at leading universities and colleges.

Give yourself a dying start this year
by getting Duofold this week. \
