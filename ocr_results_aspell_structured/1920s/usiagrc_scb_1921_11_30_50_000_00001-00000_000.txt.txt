the Curriculum committee wishes to
call attention to the following points:

1. To take part in outside activities.
a student is expected to maintain a
certain standard of grades. This
standard differs according to Classiﬁ—
cation and according to the type of ac
tivity in which the student desires to
participate. Any student who is un-
certain whethcr he is eligible for such
acti es may secure the necessary in-
formation by calling at tho Registdl
office in the Administration Building
where a full list is kept showing the
eligibility record of each stllrlout ill col
lcge.

. A student may be dollar .d from
participation in outside activities on
any one of the following grounds:

Everett Nurelius. Pioneer center.
was elected captain of next years'
football team at a meeting of the let-
tel‘ men immediately (olloll'mg the
Drake game on Thanksgiving day. It
is almost needless to say that the
choice of the team is extremely popu-

lar with the student body. For two
years now the big Pioneer center has

been one or the mainstays of the line
contributing in large measure to both
the offensive and defensive strength
of the team. At the beginning of the
1920 season, Norelius stepped into the
center position. which had been so

ably ﬁlled the year before by Wilmer.
and displayed such a. slashing. drin

ling. brand of football that' McBride

of the Kansas City Star recognized
him in his selection of ail-Missouri

Valley teams. Although handicapped
by iniuries at the beginning of the
season “Ev" has played remarkable
football especially in the Ames game.
when he was opposed by “Polly" Wilf—
lace, all-American center and in the
Turkey day classic with Drake. It
may I)? only coincidence that the last
Grinnell Captain who held down the
center position. piloted the Scarlet and
Black to a state championship.

c. If he has a current condition. A
Current condition means that the stu-
dent is not carrying his work satls
factor-iiy and should devote more tune
to his studies and not so much to the
outside activity in which he is inter-
ested. It means that his work has fal-
len below “D" either in daily work or
in examination or in both. An “"13
grade handed in at the office becomes
automatically a condition whether so
reported speciﬁcally or not.

Whenever a student receives notice
that he is conditioned in any subject
lie should understand that he is there
by dobal‘red from pal nation in out-
side activities and renders himsell li—
able to penalty if he takes part in
such activities before the condition is
removed.

tlons are also responsible for investi-
gating the eligibility of those to whom

There is no tendency to attempt

Seventy-ﬁve Men Report to Coach
Saunders for Practice—First
Games Next Week.

About seventy-ﬁve men have
answered the first call of Coach “Bud"
Saunders and are working out in
preparation for the series of class
games which will he held next week.
The schedule was drawn up at the
ﬁrst meeting of the four captains.
Glenn Miller was elected to lead the
Seniors; "Chet" Datesrnan the Jun-
icrs; and Fred Benz the Sophomores;
while "Hap” Moran of Boone was
appointed acting Freshman captain
by Coach Saunders. He will serve dur-
ing the series when it is hoped that is
better line on the material out will he
.availsble.

There is a good deal of done on the
series lately and it is very sure that
some clever playing will be exhibited
on account of the close competition
this season. especially in the forward
positions. Predictions favor tho Jun—
iors somewhat, owing to the wealth
of varsity material which includes
Garner. Fearing. Whitehill. Jansscn.
Datesnian, Smith and Norelius. How-
ever. the Sophomores are a. close sec—
ond and are apt to spill the dope be

should have a strong team. others
out for positions are Macy, Rlcbards,
Herbrechtsmeyer. Daubenberger. Fow-
ler, mgley and Berry. They undoubt-
edly will put up a good battle in their
last attempt to annex the cup before
they leave school.

There is the usual doubt as to the
'strength of the ﬁrst year men uitho
they have a number of high school
stars. Moran will probably have as
running mates a team picked from the
men who include Wluter. Galvin. Rely
tor. carter. Glehm. Medlin, Proctor.
and Armstrong. These men are its
yet an unknown quantity in local cir-
Cles but they come with splendid high
school records.

The strongest contenders will clash
in the ﬁrst game of the series when
the Juniors meet the Sophs and the
Seniors the Frosh. Each class will
'meet every other one and the per-
centagc plan will form the basis for
choosing the winner.

like precision with which the compli~

of the game compare Grinnell with
the state university which has perfect
ed that style of play. Furthermore,
the handling of the hull was so Com-
plete a reversal of past performances
that the triple and even quadruple
passes. accomplished with litghtning
like rapidity were little short of marvel
lous. These two facts are repeatedly
commented upon. and not just by cp-
thusiastic alumni but by the great
mass of observers who are seeking to
point out the real high lights of the
game.

There is not a Grinuelliai‘l anywhere
who has not tucked away in his heart
the warm memory or some great out<
burst of enthusiasm. some soul~stlr—
ring revival of thc Grihnell Spirit.
Yet it is doubtful if any can recall
a greater Grinncll spirit. a more uni-

which amazed Des Moines football
fans last Thursday. Unprejudiced

was a certain look upon the faces of
these men. and particularly of ti
freshmen who were of necessity on
the sidelines this year, that meant the
season of 1922 in reality begun at 4:45
p. m. last Thursday. At the Grinncll
dinner that night. words were uttered
which cheered the heart of every
Gi'innelllari, words of courage and op~
timism and determination. Everyone
seemed to feel that with the seasoned
men who will hold over, plus the re-
marlmble material which the yearl.
ing team will yield up. Coach Saund-
crs will build a championship team
next year.

And this spirit was expressed not
in words alone. for one particular
thing seems to have been determined
upon. This 1922 optimism is going to
be translated into action this spring
when Saunders issues the citll for
April and lloy practice. A stalwart
lad who will wear the scarlet next
year. speaking of a eertain western '
team which has won national recogni—
tion this ycar. said ”They get the
jump on the others by intensive
spring practice. They are in mid-
scnson form when they go home for
vacation. it we can take next spring
to get over some of the difficulties
which have been a. handicap during
the actual playing season this fall. we
ought to go through next season with
a clean slate." Such sentiment
means that the Pioneers are prepared
to pay the price for complete suc-
cess. Translated into action it will
bring victory home to Grinucll.

The Drake game will in the end
prove a real victory because it has
