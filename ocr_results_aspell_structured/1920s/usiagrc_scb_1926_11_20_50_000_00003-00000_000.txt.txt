WHEN Greek or calculus gets you into a right
corner, tie a tin to trouble—a tidy red tin of
Prince Albert! Tamp a lead of this really
friendly tobacco into the bowl of yum-I jimmy-
pipe and light up. Watch the sun crash through
the clouds with every pug!

P. A. can’t bite your tongue or parch your
throat, no matter how fast you feed it, because
the Prince Albert process gave Bite and Parch
the air at the start. Cool as a Laplander’s lap.
Sweet as apple cider. Fragrant as spring blos-
soms. That’s Prinpe Albert! /

One pipe-load invites another. And
you can hit P. A. from morning till midnight
and it won’t hit back. Don’t put OH to tomorrow
what you can smoke today. Get a tidy red tin
of P. A. and turn on the sunshine . . . now!

PRiusi: ALBERT
