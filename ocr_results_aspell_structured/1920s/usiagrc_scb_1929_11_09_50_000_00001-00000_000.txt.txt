marizes the terrible conditions in
tho textilo mills in the South at
tho present time, the recent cf-
forts of the workers to obtain a
li ing standard and tho injustioo
used by the forces of the law in
queuing those efforts. Because

by its content it reprdsents the

essential weakness in our widely
heralded “American Prosperity“,
the attention of all the readers
of this paper is called to this
edlml-ial.

Y. M. NC. A. Has
New Procedure
for Discussions

Two innovations in the method of
conducting v. M. C. A. meetings were
introduced Thursday night when a
group led by Lewis Troyer met in
the Smith hall club—room to discuss
a chapter from Will Durant's new
book. The Mansions of Philosophy.
The Y. meeting which was held in
a building club room for the ﬁrst
time this year was attended by about
thirty students. The comparatively
large gathering was interpreted as a
justiﬁcation for continuing the meet-
ings in building club-rooms rather
than in Associations building where
the discussions were formerly held.
The second innovation of using
current literature as the basis of dish
cussion will also be continued inter—
mittently throughout the year. Last

.night's discussion which was entitled

“Democracy on the Crinnell Campus"
was based on the Chapter “Is De-
mocracy a Failure" in Will Durant's
latest book, The Mansions of Philo-
sophy.

Troyer as chairman began the
meeting by pointing out Will Dur-
ant's distrust of democracy. Among
the statements quoted to prove this
point were the following passages
taken from the book. “By its origin
and development democracy means
the rule of the middle class—govern-
ment by the second best: democracy
is government by those who do not
know" and “When the masters fell
out, the people tell in. When the
men fell out the women fell in. Now
we are all in the morass together;
and it becomes a problem real indeed
how we can ﬁnd someone to drag us
out once everyone is in"

pups at Des Moines, losing by a score
of 39-0. Drake presented a forward
wall that averaged 177 pounds to the
man. while Grinnell's average was
only 159. Weight in the backﬁeld was
more evenly divided. but the Drake
frosh boasted a fleet set of hacks
that could not be denied. ,

With this advantage to start with,
Drake sent in another complete team
in the second period, which showed
equal aggressiveness and power, As
a result, the score at halftime was

fectiveness at running with the ball
