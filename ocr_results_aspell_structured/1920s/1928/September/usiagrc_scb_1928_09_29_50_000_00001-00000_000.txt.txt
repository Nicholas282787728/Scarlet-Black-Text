Special Date for Appearance Set
For Monday, October 8, In
Herrick Chapel.

KIBALCHICH IS DIRECTOR

Varied P r 8;; a m of Russian
Music and Folk Songs To Be
Given by Symphonic Choir.

The Russian Symphonic Choir will
appear in concert in Herrick chapel
Monday evening, October 3, at eight
o'clock under the direction of Basile
lcibalchich. The choir, which gave a
concert in Grinnell in February 1926,
will present a program of Russian
music, lolk songs oi a humorous and
serious nature and other features.

Russia is noted ior producing more
and better hasses than any other
country, and Grinnell lovers of mu-
sic will get a chance to hear some of
the best bass singing when the choir
appears in its concert.

it is legendary in Russia that an
angel once organizing a choir of six
hundred voices, had many applicants
who could sing soprano, alto, contralr
‘to, tenor, and baritone, but only one
bass, a Russian. When the first fer
hearsal was called. however, that soli-
tary Russian bussmprofunda covered
all the other voices oi the celestial
choir.

in its appearance heforc the Crin-
nell student body in 1m the direCr
tcr's complete control or the fine
range of dynamics, his regard tor var
cal details and the resulting product
was enough to insure an enthusiase
-tic mldience wishing a return engage-
ment.

Singing Suggests Orchestra

The chorus not only sings but
hums, and by means oi fine grada-
tions of tone and accent often sug-
gests a string orchestra.

One of the important features of the
program will he the folk songs. Folk
songs are essentially the expression
or a nation’s soul, and therelore more
vm' less local in appeal and are rarely
appropriated by peoples or other
lands. A few folk songs with a pzlr»
ticular human appeal have become
known the world over, and the "Volga
Boatman" song, like "Home sweet
Home” and “Swztnee River," is one
ol this class. The "Volga Bostlman"
is one ot the selections that only a
Russian' Symphonic Choir can do
justice to.

According to Prof. George L.
Pierce, who has charge of arrange
ments tor bringing the choir to Grin-
nell, the concert here is a special
date secured through the iact that the
choir was passing through Grinnell
on one of its national tours.

In a feature debate, Harvard tini-

Oxlord, Cambridge and Harvard unlr
versities are among the schools that
have debated here during recent
years.

The Undergraduate speaking Es-

Forensic, will soon get under way.
The former is a plan first put into

General Reception to Furnish Excuse
For Modest Preps to Ask for Dates

This evening will see the beginning
ior another year or that historical
declaration "Oh; yes! i met you at
the General," Many u l he the tuxes
and iormals that are liltuled lorth
from the moth halls for the occasion.
Others dust from the shops will cu-
dcavor to exhibit what well—dressed
collcge man and woman will wear to
the formats this winter.

From the number or datesichztpci
and otllel'wiseiwhich have already
appeared on tho campus: it seems
that the General should have been
held c. cl iu the week to he nl' any
real sl‘l'vicc, But possibly there will
be some I sting results at the attair,
even though it is held at this late
date

It is hoped by all concerned that

 

each cottage is paired with the right
building this eveniuglhut how could
it lie? Time only can tell which will
be the disappointed ones,

Practice in decorating cottage par»
lors, w ' g iloors, and squeezing
lemons ins already come to many
duadranglcrs through the medium of
the general. There will be some still
knees and elbows and wr ts in the
grand march past the receiving line.
Just so none of the lame members be
long to thc musicians: l\n eliort is
being made to rcmovc this l‘cspoush
bility.

Nonc will need to worry about los-
iug many hours of sleep by attende

that there will be a 100% record oi
