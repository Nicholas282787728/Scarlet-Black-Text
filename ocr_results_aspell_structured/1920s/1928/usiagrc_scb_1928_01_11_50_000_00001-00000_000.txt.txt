Varsity Squad Practically All
Back This Year; Sophomore
Material Promising.

TAYLOR MAY BEAT BROTHER

McKee May Figure Prominehtly in
Middle Distances; Green Is
New Pole Vaulter.

With the chances for A strong track
team the best since the days of Mon
gan Taylor, Coach Duke has begun to
groom bis cinder athletes for a stren-
uous winter and spring campaign.
Besides a varsity squad from last
year which is intact except ior Rinea
fort and Meeter, there is some sopho-
more material which may figure in
Missouri Valley competition this year.

The Fioueer's strongest event will
Probably be the hurdles. captain
Long. who specializes in the highs
but runs the lows well, will be but one
of the four or five men who run the
race fast enough to place in close
competition. Taylor, a brother of Mor-
gan Taylor, promises to repeat and
perhaps better the time of his fam-
ous relative, He has broken several
of his brother's high school records
and set a new record in the low
hurdles in the freshman telegraphic
meet last spring. Maytum, also a
sophomore, runs a low hurdle race
comparable to Taylor's. He was sec-
ond to Taylor last year in the tele
graphic meet, turning in 25-second
time. Another fast hurdler is Davis,
who will exchange his basketball toss
for a track uniform in the spring.

Relay Team Mill" Figure.

Griunell may have a mile relay
team which will figure in the big
mects this spring. McKee, who was
second in the Valley quarter—mile
event last spring and who is credited
with «lo—second time, will he another
Iran. There are several other fast
middle distance men. Kingery, Hoff»
man, (members of last year's relay
foam) and SIye are experienced
men, while Taylor, Mark and Barnes.
exVyearlings, have been credited with
fast time in the 440.

Grinnell has no Paulus or Hoyts to
script for her this year, but she has
an array of material out of which
great sprinters might develop, Mc-
Kee, besides running a fast quarter.
runs the 220 below 22 second Da s
also runs the event in good time. May-
tum and Pelletier are probably the
best sophomore-material. Both turn:
ed in fairly good time in both sprints
as freshmen.

In the distance events. there is no
outstanding material. Phillips. \l‘inr
her of the intramural cl‘oss~country
meet this fall, is probably the best.
Wyatt, captain of next year’s eraser
country team. and Selle, a letter man
from last year. may figure in compo-
tition. '

For the first time in years. Grins
nell seems to have a pole valutcr.
Green, who placed in the freshman
telegraphic meet last year. has a rec-
ord of nearly twelve feet. McIntirc is
another pole valuter who goes fairly
high. I

.lttvelin strong Field Event

of the iield events, the javelin
seems the strongest, largely because
of Laird. L‘aird has been a leading
Valley man in the spear event for the
last two seasons. He has a record
close to 190 feet which he expects to
better this spring. Ingram also tosses
the javelin about 170 lect.

In the weight events, Gl'innell
misses Ilincfort, last year's captain,
No material anywhere near his cuual
has shown itself. However. Laird and
Davis may perform well in the discus
and Bradley, fileland. Davis and
Briggs may do something with the
invelin.

The only brondjunmereyet unearth-
ed is Ingram, but the high jump ma-
terial is promising. McCully and
Phipps cleared almost six feet last

a violinist of uncommon gifts. Her
tone is large and mellow and opulent.
She has sensibility and intelligence
and musical feeling; and she has a
touch of the ‘grand manne inher
style." The San Francisco Chronicle
thus summed up the concensus or
critical and public opinion concerning
Miss Hansen: “Twice caressed by the
gods that determine destiny, Cecilia
Hansen is again and again beloved of
audiences that see her personal beau»
ty and hear her play the 'violin."

"It is a new song that Cecilia Han»
sen's fiddle sings she can do all that
any man can do," the Toronto Even-
ing Telegram said of her. The Syra-
cuse Journal proclaimed her, “The
greatest woman violinist of the age."

“Maude Royden is one of the great
women of the world. and I think very
few people in Grinnell will deprive
themselves oi the opportunity of hear--

opinion in regard to Smoking," Luella

"i hope we are big enough to judge
her entirely by the force of her per:
soliality and the enduring power of
her message."

Although Grinnell has lost her first

them indicdtes that she will rank well
up in Valley circles before the soda
son is ended. In playing the two
teams which lead the conference in
in games won and lost, and against
Slx of the eight high point men. the
Pioneer squad has displayed two
close games with each of the Okla—
homa teams. It has scored 118 points

thirty points a game, it has been the
only team to hold Oklahoma univer-
sity below [orLy‘ points and has landr

high scorers and two more in the
upper third.

Coggepllull Outstanding.

coggeshali has been the Pioneer's
outstanding mdn so far. His thirty—
seven points place lnm Sixth among
the confercacc scorers and his steady
floor work hits contributed much to
his team's play. Loveioy, a guard.
playing his first/year, ranks second
in points scored for Grinnell. He has
contributed seven baskets to the Fio-
neer total, but his most remarkable
record comes as a fowl shooter. He
made all of his ten chances good.

Captain Davis ranks next to Lover
joy as a scorer. He has made twen-
tyetwo points chiefly by baskets. His
main work for the squad this year has
been in jumping oposiug centers. He
is not tall, in comparison with men
he has jumped against. but he has
managed to get the tip-off his share
of the time.

Peterson and Fail, the other mem-
bers ol the varsity five. have good
records on the score sheet Peterson
has made seventeen points and has
