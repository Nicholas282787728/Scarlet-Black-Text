and Tuesday, in which two new rac-
ords were set, thc sophomores hot-e.
ly nosed out the Ircshmen hr 4 L2
points under weather conditions suited
fur anything hut a truck meet.

The sophomores Worn aided lunch in
the tact that the two iligli point men
were in their ran Taylor, running

Is 1-4 points by virtue or his wins in
the two hurdle events, the hroatl jump,
and mile relay. Pellotier, the second
high point man, collected ll 1-4

points; Golz, a ireshmau. “as close out

his heels with S -l points.

t to the performances or these
high point melt, the work-of Greene,
a sophomore, and Laird, a senior was
outstanding. Greene broke the pole
vault record with a leap of 12 feet.
Considering the cold and disagreeable

day in which the recordrbrealrer wasl

compelled to periorlll, this jump was
an unusually good one. Laird tossed
the iavelin for 132 ieet, setting a} new
record iu‘that event,

The best race oi the afternoon was
the hair mile run in which Barnes,
