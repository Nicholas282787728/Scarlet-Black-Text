Rotog‘ravure Effect
To Feature Cyclone

With the announcements that all
Juniors and seniors must make arr
rongements to have their pictures
taken, work on the 1930 year book
started today. _

There are several innovations
which the management plans to make
. in the new Cyclonc. The use of tour-
color plates will neces 'tate two more
processes in the printing ot the one
nual than ordinarily. The use ct sepia
ink, which is the medium for the pro-
duction of the rotogravure cricct in
Sunday newspaper features, will in-
crease the attractiveness of the llew
book, A new method of typography
and a two-column page plan will be
used,

One ot the most unusual tcatures
oi the Cyclone will he a set or tour
photographs taken or the l‘rl'illllall
campus from the air. The borders or
all the pagcs in the newnnrlllal will
carry out student lite in a silhouottc

Library Receives

Valuable Addition?

Edward L. Fitch Estate Makes
Valuable Gift to Grinnell.

A most interesting and valuable
slit to the college library is a collec-
tion of six hundred volumes from the

Blurts. Mr. Fitch, as an experienced
traveler, gave a large portion or his
library travel hooks, iascinating in
their diversity. European architecture
and painting compose the subject
matter at many of them.

A keen interest in Jeanne D' Arc
gave rise to a collection of approxi.
mately two hundred volumes on that
subject alone. Many volumes are also
devoted to the study of Dante. A
glance at the titles reveals the some
plete Works ot Hawthorne, Ruskin,
Kipling, Tennyson, and Stevenson.
The unique “Diary of Samuel Pepys"
will he placed on the shelves trom
this group. or interest to the history
student should he the works or Fran-
cis Parkman.

Through Miss Read, the Carnegie
Foundation has given, besides a sum
or money to be devoted to books, a
number at volumes on architecture
and painting.

These, with the contribution from
the Fitch contribution, should give
every student in the college an opp
portunity to find a hook for his work,
a book for his leisureisomething to
amuse, something to instruct
