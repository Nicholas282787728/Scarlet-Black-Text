.\ MATTER OF CUTTING.

The action taken last night by the Strident Council
in legislating on stags at Varsity dances seems com~
mendable in the light of the situation existing this year.
The rule requiring all men to pay a unitorm admission
to dances whether they are accompanied by dates or
not will serve a duul purpose. It should encourage dat-
ing and should‘ discourage the large number oi stags
with the accompanying evils. '

It is apparent to one in touch with tnc sitluation
that there is not the amount or dating this year as was
apparant last year. The purpose or this article is not
to advocate promiscuous dating in all its forms. However,
attendance at 'rai-sity dances should be encouraged. The
attairs are sanctioned hy the college as a whole and
come at the end of a hnsy Week tor most ot the students.
They serve as a recreation period for the student body.
It would seem that the varsity dance should he 'morc

attractive than an hour of dancing in the recreation
room.

'29,

With a premium placcd on stags at a dance an in-
centive will he iurnished to those men who go to a dance
unaccompanied and yet dance the cutirc‘ evening to have
dates tor the aliair. At one dance over twenty-live
men iormed the stag line cutting in the whole evening.
It these men were asked to pay admission, it is site to
say that over half or them would have dates. 1‘

An admission price ior stags materially cut down
the number or men whose apparent duty is to term a
stag line and disconccrt the individual “he brings a
date. A great many. especially among the women,
have complained at the congregation of stags who are
continually cutting in. Several men have been heard to
say that they scarcely see their dates more than onc
dance alter the intermission, It is obviously unfair to
the man who dates when men take advantage oi trcc ad-
mission to impose themselves upon the dancers.

STIUJENT INITIATIVE.

It has been corrcctly stated that the three essentials
to mental health are a (ask, u plan ,lulll irecdnm, or, in
other words, a project, a method, and the stimulus oi
unlimited opportunity These factors are not only es
sential to mental stability, hut arc also necessary to in-
liridual initiative, especially student initiative as it may
he cycnipliiied in a small college. it is impossible to
gain student support ior any enterprise in a college com—
munity unlcss a large sphere or action be granted to
the students

Grinnell lite hus been established upon such a pre—
misc. For years the college admii'stration has en-
thusi stically upheld strident control in many different
iields. At various periods in the history of the school
situations have ariscu in which the administration had
to choose between a continuance or the principle oi
strident control or its abandonment in favor oi admire
istrotiye of iaculty supervision and regulation. In ale
most or cry one oi thcsc crises the issue has been de-
cided in iavor or the studmlts, The \lilderllillg thought
scmus to have been that tree student action, despite its
admitted detects, has much more educational value and
hence has greater i lidity in an institution of lcarning
than any plan hy which the thinking is done almost cx-
clusivcly hy facility membels.

Perhaps this may he called a ”lalssez lair-c" educa-
tion policy, and some would say that such a policy is
passc and antcdoluvian in this modern age of special»
ists, exports, and thought mechanics. We hold, hone
ever, that the very essence or a lihcral arts environment
opposes predigestion, limitation, regulation, and re-
striction. The individual student in a college or liberal
.t s should he tree to grow intellectually without limit
The university, with its complex system of organizations,
[acuityestudem hoards, etc., may he properly a place ior
specialization and concentration ot control; the small
college certainly is not, and any comparison of the two
types oi institutions is, based on the must glaring
iallacy. I

We write only to caution those interested in the
welfare ct Grinnell and every other small college. In—
dividual student enterprises must be preserved at any
cost, They are the very lite of the college. Take them
away, or restrict them materially. and very little will he
lett to interest the thoroughhred, mentally alert, Selle
rcliant undergraduate,
