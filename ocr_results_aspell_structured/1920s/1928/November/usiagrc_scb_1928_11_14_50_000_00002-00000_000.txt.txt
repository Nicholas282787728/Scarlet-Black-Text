to ests and the interest of college students. It seems
particularly possible that relations between the United
States and France will be aided by the "Junior Year
Abroal " plan which is being adoptcd by some institutions
in this country.

Doctor Stcplien P. Duggan, director of the Institute
or International Education, is in gellclal charge anti the
plan has the commendation or many prominent educa-
tors, It has the cooperation ol American college tactil-
ti s and French authorities, has passed out of Kile axe
periineirtal stage, and has become a permanent factor in
international cducation. Tire student, according to the
plan, slldll spend his lirst two undergraduate years in
an American college, attend some French institution his
junior year arranging llls course so that he w l_ be able
to return to America [or his so r year and his degree.

To he cligihlo for a soliola 'p offered by the Carri-
nrittee on l-‘oreign Travel and study through the Institute
of [mo rational Education, the [inlet can student must
declare his or her intention or returning to an American
cuilcgc for a degree. The scholarships are made possible
through the gcncr-os. y of a group ot‘ interested persons
and amount to $1000 each In addition to these there
have recently been given to the committee about twenty
scholarships or $300 each, the purpose or which is to

This plan it several obvious advantages. The num-

count as ar iactors which make the plan well worth
consideration and support.
