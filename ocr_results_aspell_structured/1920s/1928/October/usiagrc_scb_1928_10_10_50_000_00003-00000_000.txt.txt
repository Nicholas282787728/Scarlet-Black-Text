Dedinsky Tells of

Russian Conditions

Speaks Before CosmSpolitan Club
Last Saturday Evening.

Miss nedinshy, in speaking to an
open meeting ot the Cosmopolitan
elnn Saturday evening, told some oi
her impressions oi Russia troin her
recent visit there. The past summer
she spent as interpreter tor the Sher-
Wood Eddy party, oi which Professor
Strong was also a memher.

After an absence or titteen years,

lion, civil par, and [amine had all lelt
their rraecs. Communism has put new
ideas into the minds oi the people,
and new words into their speech.

“You cannot understand the Russia
of today niitil you realize what has
gone before,” iiiss Dedinsiry declared
For cellturios the whole manner oi
living was gorerncd by the czar. A
peasant rarely knoll how even to

Schools \rt- Iiicrrosiiig

Schools are everywhere. By I933
the Russians fell sure that not a per-
son from their Whole population of
about 284 millions will be unable to
reed and write.

Special attention is paid to tho
‘trrtining or children, [or it is they who
are to make the ideal state of the
future. Boys of fourteen have studied
Plato and Karl Marx, and know the
history of the United states, Organ-
ization, too, is Part of the curriculum.
From‘iirst grade on up meetings are
conducted by the students, through
officers whom they elect from among
themselves.

Cards and modern jazz are taboo
among the new school in Russia.
“They arouse very bad passions,” Miss
neoinsky was told. Cards arouse the
acquisitive insLiuct, which is contrary
to good Communism. Chess and
checkers, as well as outdoor sports.
are especially popular. Recreation
is played zestfully by both men and
women.

The young people look serious and
worn for years of hunger and Want
have left their hlark. But their spir-
it is hopeful and forwardslooking. and
their thought and conversation is
centered upon the Russia of the futr
ure.

 

CHAPEL AIIENDANBE
EMPHAﬂZEl BY MAIN

President Tells Why Voluntary
Chapel Is In Vogue oi
Grinnell College.

’“Attendlince at chapel is not coni-
puls y at Grinllell hecause it is too
important to note whether a person
is absent or present," stated Presr
dent Mom in Tuesday morning's chap-
el period.

"One reason [or going to chapel,"
pointed out the President, "is that a
person should expose himselt to as
mam- inrlneucos as possible—some
tlllilg thar may he too important to
evaluate hy any sort ot a mar-1r." We
mm to you here a glimpse oi the
principles that constitute to loyalty,
to Sel'HCc. to cooperation, and to the
common good. These principles con.
sun-e together to make me worth
while and to make rightoonsue- in
lite worth while. But those rinali
that are worth n liilo come train train
in and tiiei-eioie this chapel is your
responsihiiity because we know that
this is the only way of aohiermg with
you the thing we are so eager
