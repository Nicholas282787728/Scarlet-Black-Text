ship. lii the usual sort of choirs
which are built along traditional lines,
attention is given to the quality of

soprano section and the tenor section
of a choir, But the Russian choir is
a compact body of no more than twen—
ty.two members and eacli voice has
an important part to play in the in»
terpretation of each number. There.
fore, lilr. Kibaichich selects his lnr

as a conductor of a symphony orches-

Mr. Kibalchich to the timbre of each
voice, to the range, to the duality of
the voice and finally to the solo abil-

Russian Choir is really a body of
solo singers joined together under the
able leadership of a master musician

which has been called by many critics
“a human orchestra." {

Some critics of the New York press

qualities of several of the voices. For
example, the New York Journal said,
“One of the most thrilling experiences
we have had in the concert room this
season was the performance of a
“Credo" by Gretchaninoff, the word
intoned with a resonant intensity by
a young mezzo ot the choir, against a
background by the other singers."
The New York Americnn said: “The

Enrollment In Tennis Glasses Is
Unusually Large According
To Miss Andersen.

HAVE LARGE HOCKEY GLASS

Growth of Department This Year
Is Indicative of Increased
Interest In Sports. .

inauguration of fall activities in the
department of physical education for
women this week marks the beginning
of a season of unusual interest, ac.
cording to liiiss Clara J. Andersen, dl.
rector of the department. The large
enrollment for dancing. tennis, up.
per class hockey and swimming as
well as widespread interest in the
department as a whole, launched the
fall term with vigor at the opening of
classes Monday.

The perennially popular tennis has
gathered an unusual number of ad-
herents this fall with unprecedent-
ed enrollments in both beginning and
advanced sections, so that continu-
ance of mild weather now seems the
only remaining essential for produc-
tion of a bumper crop of net cnthv .
lasts. Hockey, a sport which has
shown tremendous development here
during the past few years, is a prime
favorite with npperclass women. more
than thirty-five having signed for the
advanced section. Many of last year’s
stars will again take the stick in
hand, and should develop the game to
an advanced stage unknown in local
hockey history. if the expected re-
sponse of freshmen women develops
the frosh will have a team capable
of giving the upperclasswomen plenty
of stiff competition.

Owing to the large number ‘of wom-
on who have elected dancing for their
fall work, the enrollment in danc»
ing classes in the greatest in recent
years, and outstanding in the history
of the department. Senior floor work
is also being elected for the fall per-
iod, and will be followed by a course
designed in preparation for teaching.

Swimming is this year being given
twice a week for those who elect it
for credit. indication of its growth as
a popular women’s sport is found in
the l‘arge number who have signed
for both beginning and advanced
classes during- the fall term. Fencing
is also being offered. and hiking
squads will be organized as usual.
Vollcyball and golf are other sports
which may be, elected during the fall
season.

Interest in physical education and
the tendency to regard it is an inte-
gral part of the college curriculum
are becoming increasingly evident
each year, according to Miss Ander.
sen, and are particularly noticeable
with the opening of the work this
fall. Requests have been numerous
for permission to enroll in four class-
