Are college students too busy to think? This is a
time [or thinking, certainly, as a national election day
approaches. There is no paucity of subjects or lllll‘ﬂer
diate concern to everyone upon which to meditate. And
yet, “hat is the attitude of college students towards
them? Presumably, El young man or Woman Student in
a college has entered an atmosphere of thought, cxpect»
[mg to spend at least a fair portion or his time upon the
more serious issues of life. Presumably, his lectures in
history or economics, his reeitntions in Latin or mathe-
matics, are properly supplemented by earnest and intelli-
gent considerations of present problems in various fields.
It is also it) be inferred that its least it share of this
thinking is spontaneous in nature. These are’all fair

assillnptions. The world expects that college litc is thus
organized, for it believes in colleges, and continues to
support them only on the theory that they train men
and women in citizenship. And yet—we wonderﬁdoes
the college strident have time to think?

Take Grinnell, for instance. A Grinncll student has
twent ., our hours o day to useain this respect he does
not (lifter from other beings. A survey would probably
show that he spends on the average around seven hours
in repose, in varying degrees of peace. He is (00 blue
to enjoy his niccls, so he allots hilt olle hour per day- to
the process The next item on the time sheet is classes,
which consume around three hours of thc twenty-four.
Ho now has thirteen hours lett, of which house responsi-
bilities probably require three. (He must attend house
meetings, look after the treshmcn, and spend the usual
amount at time in goodiellowship.) it he has three
classes a day, he usually studies tour hours in proparr-
tiollior, lire we too crcduious? six hours thus remain
for all other activitie , including athletics, social life,
lectures, recitals, corrcspnudeuce, and special scholastic
Work. in the nature of reports and essal‘s.‘ The fact
seems to be, that the divinely appropriated twcllh tour
hours does not suttice even for the itmts mentioned.
Proof? Did you ever tail: to a collage strident who rea

 

tires at night, having completed every single task?

“Piille, inefficiency!" is the retort to all of this. “Ill
the college student organized his work systeluzliiczilly,‘I
he would experience no difficulty in doing it and more
too." Professors, business men, and parents are loild‘
of this type of reply. l’l’ell, we have seen veritable goll' 1
uses at eftic ,llcy among the students adopt the advice,
only to nlmndoll the effort in despair, alter lending :ill‘
the a illiflllle literature on ol'gi'llli ion of schedules,
“How to Study,” and college efficiency Or, it they Surr'
cecd ill studying systematically, they become correspond-
ingly until: in Silll10_0tllcl‘ phase of college life. ‘

Perhaps this is lel undesirable situation. Serious
political discussions should probably engage Grillllell
students, just. as they (lo English young men in the 0X
ford Union. The fact is, however, that they do not,

Picture oi college lite; we do not attempt to cxllltiin it,
or to condemn it; it any one factor is important as a
cause, however, we believe it is the American school sysr
tern, which provides insufficient elementary and second-
Elry preparation, and higher educational mechanism
which is standardized down to the level of the lower
school product and serves as a more routine to he fol-
lowed to obtain a socially necessary implement, the a, 13,
