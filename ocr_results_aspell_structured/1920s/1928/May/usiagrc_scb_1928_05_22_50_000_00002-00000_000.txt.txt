Tl-I'E F,\)[iIiY PROBLEM

A \Vonmn's ﬁrst and primary duty to the World is to
be 2t n‘luther. If woman ﬁrst began the domestication
of animals, the cultivation of plants, if she learned to
shear the sheep and Weme clothes with the Wool, and
to tan (he hides of animals, it was not for wealth
or proﬁt, but to provide food and Clothing for her family.
\The brain, the heart, and the muscles at the primitive
woman developed around the fact that She was to he the
mother of children. on the other hand, it was the duty
of primitive man, and is the duty of modern man, to pro-
tect his family and to help the Woman provide the neces-
sities for its existence. But as civilization has advanced,
the fact that business is carried on as A means of prep
riding for the raising of the family is being forgotten,
perhaps not intentionally. It is quite naturally the u'ish
of the nian to want the best that can be'ohtained for
his household as it is the wish of the mother. But mod-
ern civilization hits made life so expensive that in many
instances it takes nearly all of the time at both the man
and the woman. to secure What is needed for just them-
selves that there is no opportunity of raising children.
This would he true of the educated class, but in the
uneducated class the iamilics are so large, that the chil-
dren do not get a square deal. There is another Class,

lL-urlcr Cnhh. '29

the wealthy class where the husband spends all his time
acquiring riches and playing goli, while the mother ﬁnds
it necessary to devote all her time to the spending or her
husband's money, with the result, the children are neg-
lecteil.

Tho clrtss to solve the problem is the educated class.
This group is conirontcd \\itli the question whether or not
children should be raised through the home and the
family or in some other way. The existence of tile race
depends on [lie raising 01‘ oii-sprlng. History at the past
shows quite clearly that ii civilization expects to stand.
it has to be founded around the homo and the iaimly.
Perhaps more is some other way. What it is, has not
a. . tbccu discovered, but there are a great many expo '»
lllents being tried. However, none of these experiment.
will prove successiul unless the woman keeps in mind
the [act that she as the mother or the race in a large
measure determines the success or downiall oi a civiliza-
tion. It a woman wishes to devote her tits to business.
to society, to wcliiire work, or community work. She must
either have no children, or if she docs she must neglect
either her up : or her childrn and it is usually th latter.
However, there s little danger of many women gi ing up
their home in the sake or a constructive community
work, the tendency seems to be towards a social life.
Tile uneducated class, the ominon working class, con.
tinues to raise large iami es. whose opportunities are
few. What will happen ii there comes a generation or
children raised under such conditions? \

The ouug women or the educated class must accept-
their primary rcsponsibii y. Their education should be
in view or the iact that they are the prospective mothers
oi the world. This does not mean that they are to do
nothing else. It is well tor a woman to bc trained in
some vocation, and use her training and ability until she
is ready to devote liorscli to motherhood. A woman
with a vocational training is better able to meet any
ﬁnancial c .is which might come to her household. How-
ever, after a woman has raised a. iamily, one of the ﬁnest‘
things she can do is to devote her time to the mothering
of a conilllullit in which her interest his steadily been
growing as her children have become more closely associ.
atcd with it. .-\. c. R.

OBJECTIVE .

lim‘y H. Lewis of the Park School in Cleveland cnulilel»
ates chztl'zlctEristics, the attainment of which it is said
might well be the ultimate objective of modern educnr
tinn. They are insatiable intellectual curiosity, an ap-
preciation of spiritual Values, good physique and love of

the outdoors. emotional balance and imagination. an abli-l‘

ity to do independent thinking, at capacity ior democratic}
iriendship among both sexes. backbone to iorru one's‘|
own standard oi right and wrong, zest ior work and an
ability to use leisure proﬁtably.

Idealistic? or course. But why not? Around char-l
dcteristics such as these the ﬁnest sort of personality
‘could be built. The list sounds formidable at ﬁrst. One‘
gasps. “What a paragon oi virtue!" But on second
thought they seem to be only those characteristics eve ,
one possesses in a more or less marked degree grouped
together and intensiﬁed. It would be interesting to know
a person striving to obtain them who had in a measure
succeeded. Would he he a hopeless prig or would he he
a “good egg”? —G. III. A.
