The Student Council constitution as
revised was unanimously accepted at
a meeting of the Couuoi May 1-1. The
proposed changes were discussed with
President Main Thursday of that
week. the President expressing him
self in favor of the new documcnt as
presented to him, However, when the
constitution was presented Monday
to the faculty as a whole by Eiaync
McCurl'), the decision at that group,
after considerable discussion, was re-
ferred to faculty committee on stu-
dent organizations and publications
with power to act.

The bone of contention in the face
ulty meeting and in the meeting of the
faculty committee that evening was,
among other things, by-law S of the
constitution as revised. This by-law
was set down in the minutes of the
Student Council on October 26, 1926.
as having been passed by the faculty
committee on social affairs, but there
seems to have been some misunder-
standing concerning its exact nature.

“Informal open houses shilll be per
milled in the Quadrangle or Dormi-
(Dl'y parlors on weekend afternoons
and on Saturday nights when there
are no other college functions, In the
case of house parties, open houses
may be permitted. Informal open
houses do not take the place of house
parties, and any number may be per-
mitted (luring the year."

The students are unanimously back
of this provision. but its fate Will be
decided sometime this week, unless
the matter is dEfeTl'ell until next Year.
When there will be {t new SLuuent
Council.

Other suggestions for Changes in—
cluded ft different manner of electing
officers, a cut in the membership of
the Council, a change in one of the
committees, the adoption of the name
"Student Council of Grinuell College,"
instead of the prcsent “Student Gov-

McNary-Haugen Bill
Vetoed By Coolidge

According to bulletins broad-
cast over the country late to-
day, President Coolidge vetoed
the McNary-Haugen farm re
lief bill, which was recently
passed by both houses anti sent
to the president for his Signor
ture. This is the second time
President Coolidge has killed
the farm relief hill after the
Senate had passed it.

Just what this action will
cause in political circles is not
apparent yet, but it is thought
that there will he a. break in

440 Was Feature Race of Day As
McKee Loses First by Inches
After Poor Start.

McKee's second in the quarter and
Taylor’s fourth in the high hurdles
and fifth in the lows accounted for all
of Grinncll's seven points in the last
allnuzll Missouri Valley track and
field meet in which the present Con»
lerence will take part.

The most satisfactory race of the
day as far as Grinucll fans were cone
cerncd was the «lib. McKee after a
poor start which made him trail the
field the first half or the race was
forced to run outside on the curve to
come up for sccond place inches he-
hind Hursley of Missouri who won the
event. The race was much like the
one which McKee ran at the Valley
meet the year before when lie came up
at the last just short of victory.

Taylor's places were made in
bunched fields. He was less than a
yard behind the winner in lioth races.

Perhaps the feature race of the day
was the mile relay which Missouri
won setting a new Villlcy record and
making the best time which has heen
lllailc in any meet this year, 20.8.

the contest include distinctness, giv-
ing the sense, and causing the and-

tion of “What's Tomorrow?" a prose
selection from Dixie Wilson's "Here
