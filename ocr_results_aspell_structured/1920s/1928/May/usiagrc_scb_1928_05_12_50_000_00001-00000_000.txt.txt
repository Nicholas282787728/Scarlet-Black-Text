Wohlgemut'h Dominates Scene In
1“Aria Da Capo” Presented by
Experimental Theatre.

LIGHTING FEATURES BALLET

Colorful and Effective Costumes
Are Unusual; Sterner Stars
In Role of Prince.
Ily Evelyn .donbnrn.

One oislhe most delightful produc-
tions presented by Grinneil college
this year was that of the Russian bal-
let, “The Enchanted Princess” and
“Aria da Capo," a one act play bo- Ed-
na St, Vincent Millzw at the Colonial
theater last evening by the Women's
ph_ ical education department and
the Experimental theatre.

"Aria da Capo" was dominated by
Otlmiar Wohlgernuth in the character
par-t of (‘othur-nns, Life's prompter.
who directed the lives of Corydon and
T ’ 's to fatal ends, and made Fier-
rot and Columbine, as always is their
duty, cover up the tragedy with their
farce. Thrrsis, played by Robert 1107
Donald, was the more convincing of
the two shepherd . The lighter char»
acters. Columbine and Pierrot, were
represented by Elizebath nutteriieid
and Rudolph Gilbert,

Sterner Siilrs'.

The ballet of ”The Enchanted Frin-
cess” was especially effective and
colorful in costuming. Vera Sterner
as the courtly and ardent young
prince surpassed all other characters
in h'er \ivztciolis interpretation, and
also exhibited nrore than the ordinary
amount of technique in her dancing
Muriel kntcliif was a row gracious
princess, and Blanche Hnisebus and
Ann Louise Blaul were well fitted for-
thei roles as queen and king. The
spiteful witch displayed. as would be
expected oi Lola Carpenter, appro—
pviate dramatic expression; and one
or the outstanding scenes was in the
spinning chamber of the witche

ililitn. - Chorus ,trnusing.‘

In the first act the military chorus
afforded a great deal of humor by
their pictorial make-up. Margaret.
Stevens and Augusta Towner gave a
clever interpretation or two court
jesters in the opening scene.

The island of enchantment was in-
need enchanting. In this scene the
princess lay on a bed of moss sur-
rounded by the four guardian nymphs
while the fairies danced. 0f the tour
fairies, Ruth Gordon was the most
outstanding for her toe dancing.
Eleanor Dunton as the dainty fairl-

_queen was very gracetul, The prince
finally appeared/and awakened the
princess with his kiss, and the play
ended with, a lively finale with court
ladies, peasants, and nymphs. Though
the first acts were colorful and ani»
mated, the last scene was disinguishr
ed by its pure beauty bntlr in dancing
and effect.

A great deal of credit tor the suc-
cess of the production is due to the
unusual and beautiful lighting effect
throughout the three scenes or “The
Enchanted Princess.” The colnred
lights blended with the varied color-
ed costumes of the court to produce
a beautiful and harmonious effect.

Dean of Men Declares That Youth
Is Massminded; Discusses His
Study of Freshmen.

Dean James F. Findlay was one oi
the principal speakers ‘at the closing
session of the Congregational Confers
euee of town hold at the Plymouth
Congregational church at Des Moiues
yesterday.

Prom his experience as dean of
men, Mr. Filltllﬂ’l' voiced the Hindus
ion that modern youth is massminded.
llr. Findlay stated two other con-
clusions which he has reached. One
is that young people have taken ovcr
bodily the standards of their fathers,
and, in the main, that life is measun
ed in terms of how much money you
can make.

Lastly, his studies on sex hygiene
with college freshmen, have led him
to believe that young people today are
cleaner and more wholesome in sex
relations than any other generation.

H, T. Stepper, principal of North
High school, took up the cudgel for
youth when he declared the pra er-
"God give us a thrill today and make
it hotter than yesterday" was a
travesty.

At. the close of the formal symposim,
chivalry was the chief question for
discussion. Elders claimed that the
old time courtesy is dying but young
people denied this, although admitting
that courtesy takes a different form
today.

Roger Her at, or Drake, is a guest
of Edwin Hewitt this week end.
