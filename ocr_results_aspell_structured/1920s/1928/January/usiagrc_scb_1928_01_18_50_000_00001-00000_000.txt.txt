will give Crinnell a chance to see

bore in 1925, all this spicy convoi
tion coming from the lips or the \ -
vacious senorita does not mean all
that it implies.

“In Chile," explained “Louie” in an
interview last night, "it is true that
the universities do not regulate ihe
lives of their coreds much and say
nothing about wherc the students
should live. But good parents do all
the regulating that is needed. There
are many, many good rooming hous-
es wherc parents have their girls
stay, and in these none but girls from
the university may live. In these
houses the girls are governed by
much the same laws we have liege in
crinnell. Tbo coreds may go out only
once or twice a Weeltitlley are al-
u-ays well looked after." .

Canines said that Senorita Or
was not giving the correct inipre sion
at all, when she said that "it is ve
common to find students of both sei-
cs occupying rooms in the
building,”

"There are little rooming housesi
where both the women and the men
may stay," went on Campos. “but
those who use such places are not in
the majority The girls who live in
these are girls who have no parents
to look after them, and tbc older wo
en students, mostly over twenty—ﬁve.
Good parents are just as particular
where their young girls live as they
are in this country,”

Very rarely, Campos said, docs one

“If living conditions in the Chilcaul

After a dance is completed, tbc men

of a shortage of chaos. Girls thank
the men for the dances and do all the
applauding, during which the men
may trifle with their hankies and
stand on any foot which offers the
most comfort. 'All boutonnieres,
smokes. and drinks must be furnishod

Drake Conﬁdent of Winning After
Bea/ting Nebraska for Second
Valley Victory.

NEW 0FFENSE_T0 BE USED

Pioneers Primed For Victory But
Are Not Over-Conﬁdent As
Game Approaches,

Fresh from a Mary over Nee
bi-aska, Drake comes to Grinnell to-
night to give the Pioneer basketball
team a demonstration of the gentle
art of scoring. Led by “Barney" Mey-
ers, who has scored fifteen points or
more in cvo game this year, the
Bulldogs are ready and willing to
chalk up another win over the locals.
Their record this year includes two
victories and three defeats.

Garlic 3 , Rough;

In past years, the game has been
dubbed the hardest and roughest
game of the year, both for Grinnell
and for Drake. This evening’s battle
should he no exception. Meyers or
Darncs may bring back memories of
the gridiron by plunging through the
line for a fifteen yard gain while Cap-
tain Davis or Fail may forget that
baslretsllooting is the aim of the court
game and execute some extremely
well-played tackles.

In hopes that his five will repeat its
work. of the Missouri game last week.
the Grinnell fan goes to the game ex-
pecting on even chance for victory.
[In the game with the Tigers, Grinnell
assumed the aggressimrom the first
and registered ten points to her 0D<
ponent's one in the early minutes of
play. Latc in the battle. however.
Missouri took a spurt and overcame
the Grinnoll lead to win as to 28.
Light workouts and a concentrated
lstudy in methods or offense during
the early part of this week, may give
the Pioneer five the polish nccessary
,for victory.

“Delayed Offense” TDHIQII‘v

Tonight, for the first time. on the
home floor, Griunell will demonstrate
her “delayed oftense" which worked
so well against Missouri. It consists
lo: giving the opposing team time to
get set before the offense starts, and
by sheer exactness of play, working
the bull‘ down to the basket.

The bottle will be more than a has-
ketball game t will be an effort on
the part or Grinnell to avenge a dc-
cisive defeat in football this fall and
an equal effort on the part of Drake
to keep her record clear, as far as
Grinncll is concerned, in all sports.
Neither team is over-confident and
both feel that they have a good chance
to win and will be willing to extend
to the limit,

Both fives will be able to present
their strongest lineups. each having
no important injuries which might
keep its stars from the game, I
