TI-lh SWIMMING mob.

Every one doubtless knows that the swimming pool
is one at the best advertisements Grinnell has. Some
people llilve been influenced to come to Grinuell because
there is o pool here. Not many colleges cun boust of
such an attraction. our pool may not be as large or as
beautiful as some. but we should miss it very much

Unless the pool is given sufficient funds it will be
necessary for the college authorities to close it, That
would necessitate o readjustment of our present physical
education schedules. According to the arrangement how,
students are allowed to take half of their required phySr
icol training at the pool. This insures c sludent’s regis-
tration for but three semesters. It has been suggested
and an attempt has been made this year to tax freshman
and sophomore students. A financial survey shows that
to put the pool on a sound financial basis it will also be
neCessary to tax junior men and women. A negligible
fee oi this sort would nrdlte little ditferonce to lhc stllr
debt but it would make a radical difference to the pool,

could classify llis expenditure as “college spirit," He
liliglit grumble at first, but after considering the import-
fume of the pool to the physical education program of

“'li'l' “ Olllll'!

This time of the college year is particularly dis
heartening for a freshman The wedtller is disagreeable
Examinations are approaching and he has heard mourn-
iul lull s of thulr disastrous results. The end of the sem-
ester is at hand and apparently he has accomplished
nothing, Although a big figure in high school, he was
done but little in college, either in the way of grades or
activities, Sallie of the religious beliefs which he has
held all his life are being shaken, He is disillusioned
and begins to ask himself “What's the use?" '

There should be little cause for discouragement. The
reports concerning examinations ure gencrnlly exngernl»
ed by upperclassmen in order that their fellows will
think the examination "I" took the worst of till. When
the hour approaches [or the little yellow books to be
filled, a student finds that he knows much more than he
thought he did and that the examination is comparatively
simple.

The outside activities. are so designed that juniors
and seniors lnust of necessity occupy the positions of
responsibility. A freshman is not expected to do much
in extra-curricular \vurkinone of the upperclassmen
have in their first year. And anyway, a senior usually
finds that he has proven himself a tool and taken on
more outside work than he can possibly handle efficientr
ly, together with his studie ; that he would have done
better to confine his outside interest to one line of
endeavor.

A fresllman‘s graoes the first semester are probably
the lowest of any he will have in all the eight periods of
his college life, and his work that half year has been
the hardest. As the years go on the work becomes
easier. it can be accomplished in less time and the corr
responding grades are better {or the effort expended.

The sharp conflict between a fundamental view and
more liberal thinking along religious and other lines
may produce confusion for a time, but after a while the
apparently unacceptable dilfel'erlces will iron themselves
out and things will go along smoothly as beforo

You are here in college to get what you can. or what
you want, out of it. If at the end of your freshman year-
you have made a fair record in your studies, if you have
decided on the activity in which you will be interested
(if you care for that at oil), it you lint-c collie to some
general conclusion concerning your own abilitieaand
your life work, you may consider that your first year in
college has been a success. we hope that you will not
become discouraged and that you will not be a nuitter

and give up. R. B. MC.
