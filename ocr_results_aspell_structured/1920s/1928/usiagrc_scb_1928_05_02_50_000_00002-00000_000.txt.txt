1 LITERATURE AT CHAPEL

Without plan, there have been chapel talks through
out this year that {all into an organized series. They
could be called a group of appreciations and are of value
because, to some, they open a new reading ﬁeld. to others,
they tell more of all ready made book friends.

These talks began with the reading of Robert Frost
and have been continued with appreciations of Imogen
Louise Guiney, Hendrik Ibsen, Ruth Suckow, A. S. M.
Hutchinson, and Thomas Hardy. They have been chapel
talks remembered, and this not unsurprising popularity
shows that Grinncll students are interested in the ﬁeld of
literature, particularly when it is presented to them in
this spoon»full lashion.

All life is divided into fact and ﬁction. Grinncll and
her habitants do not escape the division. We live 2i
prosaic existence, touched now and again by sentiment.
adventure, or that more inlanlous thingrscandal. Onc

, of the best known outlets for all of El human’s reactions
to the bonds of the» commonplace is through the varied
forms of literature. Reading is a. safety valve among
other things; it is acknowledged as a medium of indi~
Vidllal viewpoints, its an extending of mental horizons.
But for our peace of mind and suavity of temper it is

more importantly dn camlpc from humdrum thi ,

THE I’Ol STSTEM.

in 1926 (t committee was appointed from Lantern in
look into the cfiicncy of a point system fur the limiting
of outside activities. This committee supposedly looked
into the situation. Whether the plan was deemed
undesirable when it was studied or whether the plan
died from the same apathetic response that hns clidl‘ztcter~
ized the response to every other problem since, is not
known. Howeier, the point was brought up in chnpcl
this morning in n cnsunl \vay, bringing the need for this
reform to cur attention again.

According to a point system adopted by the All»
University- Council DI the Universitv of Minnesota, the
number of offices in campus activities is limited for
any one person.

The system in vogue on the Minnesota campus is not
the only system in the world, but it is n workable one.
All activities .rc ditidcd into three classes llccol'lliug lo
the status of but organization on the campus and the
amount of time and responsibility that each office carries
with it. in the ﬁrst class of organizations only one office
may be held nt n given time, and no other oflice in any
other class mny be held. In the second class a person
is allowed two such offices at one time, or one secoiuh
class and two thild»clztss offices. In the third class
four third class offices may be held.

Every activity coming under the recognition of the
All-University Council is evaluated ucording to the above
standard. A list of the classiﬁcation is published and
circulated among the students.

In enforcing the point system at Minnesota, it is not
the purpose of the Council to limit the service which can
be rendered by an individual student, but rather to keep
over—zealous students from holding more offices thnn
is consistent with good scholastic standing. ‘

It is not the purpose of the writer to advocate cur-
tailment of any individual's circle of activity. However,
it is the him of this article to stimularte thought on tbc
subject and to suggest another effort by Lantern to suc-
cessfully carry through such a project.

it is a. known fact that certain men of outstanding
qualities in leadership have had so many positions that
they could scarcely do justice to any one of them. While
they struggled along in that fashion, men of just as great
capabilities had nothing to do and would gladly have
taken over one activity and successfully carried it [or the
year.

In addition to Creating n larger grnup of leaders, such
c plan would undoubtedly make for more efficiency in
oifice, grenler concentration of effort and increased
satisfaction. L. R. L.
