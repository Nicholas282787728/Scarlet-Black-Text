THE POINT SYSTEM

in 1926 a committee was appointed irum Lantern to
look into the eiiicacy oi a point system tor the limiting
oi outside activities This committee supposedly looked
into the situation Whether the plan was deemed unde-
sirable when it was studied or whether the plan died
from the same apathetic response that has characterized
other worthy schemes, it is not known. At. any rate the

idea was discussed in 1926. in this column in the spring
ol the present year, the point system was discussed and
a method suggested ior innovating such a thing at Grin-
nell.

Willie we emphatically do not agree with copying
certain institutions troni a large university that serve to
turther personal ambition or merely act as a novelty
tor the time, we do not hestitate to point to an institllr
tion extant at the University oi Minnesota and ask ior its
adoption in Grinnell.

According to the point system adopted by the All»
University council oi the University oi Minnesota, the
number oi otiices iii campus activities is limited ior any
oiic person.

The system in vogue at Minnesota is not the only
system in the world, but it is a workable one. All activ—
ities are divided into three classcs according to the stat-
us of that organization on the campus and the amount
or time and responsibility that each oiiice carries with
it. in the tirst class oi organizations only one ofﬁce
may be lieid at a given time, and no other oiiicc in any
other class may he held. In the second class a person
is allowed two oiiices at one time, or one second class
and two third class offices. in the third class ioiir third
class ottices may be held at one time,

Ever, activity coming under the recognition of the
Allrljnllersity is eraluat d according to the above stand-
ard, A list or the class cations is published and circus
lated among the students.

in enlorcing the point system at Minnesota, it is not
the purpose ot the Council to limit the service which can
he rendered by the individual student, but rather to keen
over-zealous students irom holding moi-c oliices than is
consistent with good scholastic standing and good
health.

it is not the purpose ot the writer t advocate cur»
tuilniellt or any individuals circle oi acti ity. However,
it is the aim oi this article to stimulate thought on the
subject and pave the way ior intelligent thinking which
will lead to a succcssiul adoption oi this system.

it is a known tact that certain ’men oi outstanding
qualities in leadership have had so many positions that
they could scarcely do justice to any one oi them, While
they struggled along in that fashion, inch or just as
great worth and capabilities had nothing to do and
would gladly have taken over one activity and success
iiilly carried it [or the year.

in addition to creating a larger group or leaders.
such a plan would undouhtedly make ior more eiliclency
in oiiice, greater concentration oi ettort and increased
satisiaction.

THE air map of America is now in the making—on

the ground.

Ten years ago, there were 218 miles of air mail routes with
two station stops; to-ddy, a network of sky roads bridges
the country from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc and from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

Cari you imagine this growth without electricity—without
illuminated airports—without trunk lines studded with

electric beacons?

A majoriry of the beacon

isturrcd by the General

lighting problems.

Men of vision are building for increasing trafﬁc of the air.
Soon, the skies will be ﬁlled with commerce.

just as electricity is helPing to conquer the air, the land,
and the sea to-day, so to—moriow it will lead to greater
accomplishments in aviation and in every human activity.
