Great Britain and Dominions Are
Autonomous, Says Lecturer
Saturday Night.

LOCAL AFFAIRS PROBLEM

Local Interests Subordinated To
Common Welfare In Time of
Crisis, However.

“Under the terms of the imperial
Conference Report ot 1926, the British
dcminions could become completely
disassociated from their mother coun-
try without interference," said Dr.
Herbert Heaton, professor of econom—
ic hlstory at the University ‘of Minne-
sota when discussing “Present Prob-
lems ot the British Empire" in Hen
!icli chapel Saturday evening.

“Under present conditions," Dr.
Htaton continued, “Great Britain and
her dominions are equal and autono-
meus, held together voluntarily only
by their common language, ilistilllr
tious, interests, and the belief that if
they ‘do not hang together they will
hang separately.‘ " ‘

“Independence Strengthens Union.

These bonds, Professor Heaton
stated, are, however, strengthened by
the attitude of the colonies that if
they can have separation they do not
want it; by their dislike of becoming
just another group of “miserable
small nations"; and by the knowledge
that separation would give them both
irg hut.the added expense of paying,
it r their oivn protection.

The problems oi the British Empire
therefore, Professor Heaton said, es.‘
not so much caused by the relations
between mother coiiatr, ind comm.
ions as by the internal affairs of the
colonies themselves. The problem
of Canada is to “grow in stature as it
has in status” mainly by developing
its western prairies; the tasks of Aha
ilalla ls to keep itself a white British
continent and to develop its interior:
the problem of South Africa is to end
the struggle between the white and
black man; while the problem of me
did is to determine whether ivest‘crn
industrial methods can he successful—
ly used by the natives.

Lends to Sectionnllsnl.

The emphasis placed upon local
problems, of course, leads to ln<
creased sectionalism, but it is a set:-
tionalism that is no more dangerous
than that of the United States. In
times of crisis, such as 1514, local ins
tercsts are subordinated to the com-
mon welfare. in fact, Dr. Heaton‘ as-
serted, the strong self-governing co~
lony is more beneficial to Great Bri-
taiu than the weak, centrally con-
trolled one for it adopts a critical at-
titude toward the mother country’s
policy, while the weak dominion must
assume a “My country, right or
wrong” position. Thus the indepen-
dent colony forces the mother coune
_tl'y to be careful that it is in the right
before it hazards a serious move such
{\S’u'ar. in short, "Bigger dominions
are the biilwarks of peace"

piccs of the English Speaking union,

by her gentle manner and low ryth-

that lay in loose waves was bound
with a green velvet ribbon which
matched the predominate shade in her
softly draped gown. Her skirts were
modestly long and her whole manner
very reserved and charming.

"My mamniy was of arab descent,"
Miss Finch confided, "the imaginative
tales which she told to me had been
handed down to her through her

replied, ‘Oh Honey, the meanin' ain't

“1 was born ln New Orleans and ii

Finch replied when asked about her
youth, “My grandfather was a Metho-

negro lady that we called the witch-
ivoinan. When children were naughty
she would place a delicately woven
horsehair figure with horns. under
their pillows. No matter what they
did to rid themselves of this little fig—

went to bed. Even if they took it out
and burned it as dusk, there it was

"The old time negro is very faithful
and has the morals at a child; they
never steal but they expect to feed
their families from ’their master’s

have your old clothes than new ones,
Mother was tin-owing away an old
bonnet one day when A'iint Liza, who

has roughly otted down the old Vll'r

She plans to have them published tor

telling them herself and “has nothing

People of Germany
Had Small Part In
Causing WariEisen

“The German people had very little
to do with the outbreak of the World
war," stated John Eisen at a meeting
of the Cosmopolitan club in the Y. w
rooms last night. "it was the aches-
Zollern group that was in error.

“Germany has no political incentive
to start another war. The colonies
have no need of German support, and
the colonial issue is not very import
ant. The League of Nations. together
with the Hague, will eventually solve
the problem ot peace for Europe."

The churches in Germany werestate

institutions heiore the war, Mr. Eisen
said. Now they are independent and
self-supporting, and attendance is en»
tireiy voluntary.
”Christmas in Germany," he stated.
"is a holiday time: in America it is
a business matter. Easter over
there is a children's holiday,"

"The younger generation in Germ-
any has not grown up under normal
conditions,” Mr. Elsen asserted
“Schooling during the war was very
poor. Social life has not yet returned
to normal.

“The majority ol Germans did not
intend to go to war again, unless forc-
ad to by French occupation. Com—
)bulsory military training is done
away with now."

Ten Soloists.

The Grinncll Gil'ls' Glee club will
appear Friday, March 23, in its twen-

which is unusual in presenting ten
soloists. Debussy's “The Blessed

by Dante‘ Gabriel Rossetti when the

and is Still’col‘lsidel'ed one of his best
works. Some biographers DI Rossetti
have suit] that he never (lid Anything
more beautiful and more spiritual
than the poem which may be said to
embody the meditations of a beautiful
gll'l in Paradise, whose lover is at. the
Sl‘llnD hour dreaming of her on earth.

The pensive sadness of of the poem
is intensified hy‘llle atmosphere cl'e»

[poser's imagination is primarily liteiu
an, dramatic, pictorial, He is led by
it, not to the creation of musically Sig»

“Britain began an interesting series
of experiments when she granted to

would ultimately result in complete
self-government such as Canada en-
joys," stated Dr, Herbert Heaton, pro.
fossor of economic history at the
University of Minnesota, in an inter-
vicw last Saturday. The topic or dis
cussion concerned the recent British
coinini -ion sent out to India to thor-
ougllly investigate the condition of the
present lndian government. The par
tives of India are strenuously oppos-
ing this commission and much bad
feeling has been stirred up by the
work that has been done so far.

DESCRIBES OWN “MAMMY’ ’

Gap and Gown Hostess to Artist
In Cottage Five After Her
Program In Chapel.

when Miss Lucine Finch, interpre-
ter ot negro folk—Songs and tales, ap—
penred in Herrick chapel Monday
night, she greeted an audience pre—
pared by previous experience to b.-
captivated by her personality and
character depiction. On this, her sec—
ond appearance in Grlnoell, Miss
Finch presented a vnl'ietl and colorful
program with complete and artistic
mastery, not only of negro dialect, but
of the ivhole range of humor, pathos,
and spirit of religious fervor which
dominates that race,
Shims Illlglmrl'eotnle.

Miss Finch prefaced her entertainv
ment with a prior sketch of the his-
tory other old negro “maiainy” whose
philosophy, stories, and songs termed
the remainder of ,the evening's pro—
gram. This "mammy," who traced her
lineage hack to African royalty, was
a victim of the slave trade, and was
for three generations a servant of the
Finch family. Miss Finch had in her
possession an old dagiierreotype ot
her "mommy" which she showed to
her audience at the conclusion ot her
lccturc. The face of fineness and in-
telligence which it showed lent even
further meaning to the “mammy stor—
ies” which she left . iss Finch as the
heritage of childhood.

The artist's delightful recital of
”Moses in the Bullrushes" was follow—
series of tolkvsongs. among
them a novel version of the well
known ballad, “Sing Low. Sweet
Cllnl'iut” which Miss Each, with her
lite—long knowledge of the negro
spirituale, was able to interpret inimi—
tably.
“Creation“ Concluding Number

The concluding number was the
story of the “Creation." considered by
the artist as her best number. rich in
opportunity for use of the dialect, 'anrl
one which put the finishing 'touches
on an evening of unadulterated mirth
for her listeners. The religious eon~
cepttpns and expressions of the race
were read into this piece with a verve
and sympathy which stamps Miss
Finch as a master of negro‘psychol—
ogy and spiritualism. ‘
