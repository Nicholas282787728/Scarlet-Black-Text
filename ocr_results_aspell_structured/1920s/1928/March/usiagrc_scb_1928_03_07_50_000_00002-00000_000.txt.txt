The problem which the men students of the college-

face is Whether to have faculty government or coropcra-
tive student imtl faculty government. The uol‘ropol‘ative
condition of the old Senate and Court leaies no other
altel-nati es.

This tact the student committee worlting on .i new
plan has realized, The plan, the iiiaili features of
ivliicli are printed elsewhere in tlils issue, is alrattempl
to do away with as much governmental machinery as
possible. center the government within the halls, and
provide inculty eo-operatioii through the proposed (‘017
loge Council. It put in operation, it should accomplish
all three ohlects,

One possible objection to
ing an unwieldy Senate body; is that the
Council of House Chan-men is too small a
group. The answer to that obiection is that there are
just so many rules,to be passed, the fewer the better,
and when they have been put into effect, there is little
actual work for the legislative body to do. The iiorh
that the Senate has been doing in the past thiough stand-
in; committees is really the job of the Student Council
its for the heaviness of the old Senate's legislative duties,
that body met just twice this year. Tliei-etoie uliy
weight the legislative group with useless members who
have little or nothing to do when a smaller number
could handle the matters necessary in a much more
efficient iashion.

The motive in centering the government in the my
dividuzii hails is an attempt to put in motion machinery
which will build up a spirit of hall honor that will
eventually eliminate all disgraceful actions on the part

that you will do some thinking about it. '

While we are mailing plans tor the reorganization

(lexical as that may sound. it held several mectiuw at
the iii-st oi the year and accomplished nothing, mainly
because it was given very little to accomplish. why
not make it an active instead or a p nu organization”

Under the new plan for mt-n's government. the pres
ident oi the Council 01‘ House Chairmen would also be
president of the Student Council lf_tbc Senate were
abolished, the Student Council constitution would lune

the Student Council at present as standing committee

pre ’tlcnt oi the Women's League Board iiiiuiit cons
tinne to serve as \‘lcmll'esltlclit or the Student council,
but the other live League Board members who now
serie on that body could also be elected ii :u the women

college nature of these and social atlairs, the recs ullicli

man ztnd woman in school could and should so to the
Student Council for disbursement. The League Board
already has its fingers in too many pies and might as
well assume its true nature, that of inflicting penalties

le we are about this business of reform, we might
as well do it up thoroughly.

Blagg has added over a dozen species
oi mosses to the list of those known
in Iowa.

“Masses are an llnwol‘ked iicld in

othel botanists have worked on them‘
in this state Consequentl: there met
many spc cs t to be discmel‘lzﬂ and
added to the to already listed.

"You ncyer know what the mosses
will do next," Miss Blagg stated. “The
ugliest little ones/may be the most
heaiitiiiil when .\ ii get them under
the microscope. If you gather two
that you are sure are ditferent, they
will probably turn out to he alike, and
the ones you think alike are differ
