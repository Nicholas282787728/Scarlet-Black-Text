her s that the trouble lies not entire-
15/ \ th the students nor entirely with
the faculty, but that both have help-
ed in Gl‘innell's drifting into its pres
ent state.

The chief caiisc of our condition of
apathy, Professor Norris thinks, is the
lack of spiritual leadership in Grim
ncll. As it is now, there is not the
least vestige of unity bctivccn the
men's government, the Women’s gov
ernnient, anti the faculty government.
All exist as separate units With t s
lack of a central moving force behind
it, ii. Nor s said, has come what
some are terming Grinnell's lack of
spirit and enthusiasm for its arlivir
tics. lie believes that no set of reso—
lutions or rules will b s back the
seemingly absent "Griimell Spirit,’
but that onli gradual cvoliition will
right the pi escnt condition.

Professor Nulris advised both stu-
dcnts and faculty to viciv with tolerr
ance the new government that will
soon be announced. This tolerance
on the part of all concerned, he Ile-
licves, will be a great step in bringing
about a unified oriiincll.

"These three phases of tr ins," he

up what is known as the “Four

“The boys respond vciy readily to

shown. This is pccially true in the

Scribe Suggests All-College Rip Van
Winkle Act As Cure for Flu Epidemic

Now that the “Pruditles” are over
the Pioneers seem to be giving way to
suppressed emotion. Pale iaccd stude
ents with streaming eyes and red
noses wander disconsolatciy about the
corridors in A. R. H. and with trem~
bling bands they lift ragged handker-
chieis to emaciated faces. No, all
this ivoc i not the manifestation of a
secret sorrow. Fill has descended
upon the college.

The iiifirmary and the hospital have
been obliged to notity the public that
all previous offers have been with-
drawn and that no ,more rooms are
available. The kitchen at the quad-
rangle has been obliged to rent extra
trays in order to send up food to the
invalids, The line of sympathetic
friends hearingthcso trays is long

enough to reach twice down the loggia
and llalfrwrty to the swimming pool.

Statistics on this epidemic indicate
that the infil'mary has dispensed, dur-
ing the past week, 37 bushels of cold
capsules, 97 boxes of cough drops, and
153 gallons of castor oil.

The remedy for all this? It Seems
to us (its \Inprejudiccd observers) that
what the school needs is it little vaca-
tion of a couple of days. Shut down
on classes and activities, forbid the
railroads to sell tickets to students,
and lock up the library and A. n. n.
so that pcrsiateni scholars cannot
break in to attend classes. Then
everyone can go to bed and sleep the
full fortnight hours. The result?
