LOCALS MISS EASY SHOTS

Davis High Man for Truesdale’s
Team With Five Goals From
Difficult Angles.

The Pioneers trounced the Cyclone
cagers 33 to 25 here Monday in a
game marked by the surprisingly lJrlle
liant offense of the local team. Al-
though Grinnell had won her previous
tilt with Ames, ber showing the last
three games had been mediocre while
Ames had defeated the Kansas Aggies
and lost to Nebraska by a slight mar-
gin, Pioneers dropped games to both
of these schools.

Game All Grillllell’s.

The game was Grinnell’s from the
start. The Scarlet and Black broke
away for a slight lead and was on the
winning side of a 15-12 score at the
half, Two baskets shortly after the
second period began increased the
Grinllell margin but the Cyclone team
soon reduced the lead back to three
points, in the last ten minutes the
Pioneers pulled away for an eight-
point victory

it is a coincidence that the eight-
point margin was the same as in the
battle with lowa state which the his
cals won 38 to 31>.

For the first time this year, Grin-
ncll used the zone defense. "It was
a matter of expediency," coach
Truesdalc told the reporter. "Ames
was prepared for a man to man de.
fense like the one we used at Ames
earlier in the rear and could not make
her plays go against our changed de-
tense."

Ilm'is High Point Man.

Davis, although he missed several
set-ups, made his "impossible ones,"
sinking five baskets from difficult
angles near the center of the, floor.
He was high point man for Grinnell.

Fail was one of the stars of the day.
In addition to some close guarding,
he sunk three baskets, two from the
center of the floor and one a setup.
Lovejoy contributed an equal number
of points, while Coggeshall played an
impressive floor game besides making
four baskets.

Lande and Lamson starred for the
cyclones. The former made five hits
kets and a freeethrow to give him in-
dividual honors and the latter sunk
two baskets and two fouls from his
guard position. Like Fail, he went
out of the game on tools.

)lnrionettcs in two plays, "Huckle-
berry Finn," in the afternoon, and
“The Blue Bird,” in the evening of
February 22, will be sponsored by the
college faculty in place of thc annual
faculty play.

This troupe of marionettes is
among the most famous in this collnr
try. Their history dates back to the
youthful desire of Jean 01-05 to dub-
licate and own a troupe of puppets
like he saw in Far . The mar-ionettes
are from thirty to thirty-eight inches
high and possess nearly all of the
faculties oi humans. The settings
and scenes are scaled to the size of
the figures and, though they are in
reality small, they appear about life
size to the audience.

The afternoon bill is drawn from
the story by Mark Twain and
meant primarily to entertain children
The evening performance is the

Smiley Presents Three Proposals
For Amendments To Be Voted
On Next Friday.

MEN URGE MORE SUPPORT

Non-is Says Faculty Approves of
Court Action and. Stand Of
Scarlet and Black.

No definite action was taken con~
cerning student government a a mass-
meeting of the Grinneil men held
Tuesday at one o'clock in A. R. H.
Paul smiley, president of the men’s
senate, presided over the meeting. He
presented three amendments to the
present constitution, which have been
proposed by the Senate, and which
will be voted upon next Friday, Feb
rusry 17, in the reading room of A. R.
H.

Stronger student government, with
more power given to the court to get
at the bottom of all the evidence, is
the purpose of the resolutions which
are printed verbatim below. The
meeting resolved itself into a lengthy
discussion of the proposed rulings.

Iluv‘ejoy Reads Lantern Report.

The sentiment was reiterated that a
need for stronger government with
better cooperation from the students
has been needed for some 'llne Theo-
dore Lovejoy read a report which had
been prepared by the Lantern society,
in which three fundamental princi-
ples of student government were
brought out: first, that desire to have
student government must be backed
by a willingness to support the ngene
eies through which it functions; sec.
ond, that the concrete method of do-
ing so is by cooperation with the
Men’s Court, and finally, that minor
changes in the constitution cannot

‘ bring about the desired efficiency if

unsupported by an improved attitude
on the part of the students.

Frof. Henry W Norris, representing
the faculty. made a short talk in be.
half of student government at the be»
ginning of the meeting. He began by
reminding the students not to forget
that ultimately the faculty is held
responsible to the trustees for 'the
government oi Grinneil college, and
that the faculty, many of whom have
lived in Gi'innel] twenty or thirty
years, haveacduiredadeep regard for
the welfare of the school which stu-
dents could not acquire in a short
four year course.

l‘acnlt~ Not “ll'ornl Quittcrs."

“The faculty has no wish whatever
to take over the burden of govern-
ment," said Mr Norris, “but they will
if you desire i I don't think you
can sny that they are 'morai quitters.’
I wish that that could be said of all
of you. 1 don‘t think it can he said
