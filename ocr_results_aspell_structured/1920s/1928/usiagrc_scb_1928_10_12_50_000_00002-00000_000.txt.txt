.1] ORGANIZED SCHEDULE

There are two extremes to which a college student
may go. One is that he will he a grind, and the other
is the danger that he will spread himself too thin, It is
not necessary ‘10 dciine the word grind; there are very
few in any college, ztml it is perhaps a good thing [or
a school to have one or two such students, The major
it)‘ of students are Apt to go to the other threme, It
is easy to accept positions in lttl'lous outside activities

tunotc is the person who can choose two or three :tctlvV
itics in which hc is interested, and then say to all other
tcmpters, "get thcc behind me Satan, 1 have all 1 can
hnndlc successfully.”

Outside activities itre a good thing it taken in a
temperate dose. If a person has interests along a
particular line or Work or cxecutivc ability, it is well
to develop such tendencies. hut to spread oncseli ovcr
the entire iicld or outside activities otter-ed by the col—
lege is a great mistake. By so doing one is tumble to
do justice to either studios or to the outside work.
dtter all studies are the most important, although the
phrase that “grades mean nothing," is prcvalcnt on all
college campuses. If a student has any intention of
doing graduate work, and is looking tor a scholarship.
he will ﬁnd that grades do mean a good deal.

It is not entirely the fault or the individual that
he becomes swamped with outside activities, The
various departments and organizations in the college
that demand outside time must shoulder some at ‘Lhe
blame. The dramatic dcpartment will get its share or
criticism; however, it at least schedules its work and
plans nhcad tor coming events so that individuals enr
gaged in a particular production can plan their other
activities accordingly. A deiinitely planned schedule is
absolutely necessary for the student who wishes his
work to run smoothly, and thc thing that throws a
student's pel‘sunttl program into chaos is for some de-
partmcnt to throw in, unexpectedly, an untorcseen event,
The athletic department is guilty of this, perhaps more
than any other department in the college. The heads
of the department will schedule a meet four days bciorc
the event is to he held, cooly disregarding ‘the tact that
students involved in such a tardy schcdiilc may nll'ellily
have their hoods full. And,

athletic department immediately dubs him as a qllltte -

right 'to demand that a person give up actin‘tlcs that he

Real Economy Seen

For the beneﬁt of a tow fl'osh

HELL WEEK, all week. Some fresh
say that it- is foolish to call this
pal'ticulhr space of time by that
coenomen. They say that "days
may come, and days may go, but

 

HELL (chk) goes on forever,"

Such nonsensci These freshies
don’t seem to appreciate their well
treatment. Think oi the saving in
clothcs that comes from wearing;
aprons, overalls, big bow tics (hide

they wouldn’t fail to «see what good

sophomore chit this will enable the
sidewalks to bear the burden of the
