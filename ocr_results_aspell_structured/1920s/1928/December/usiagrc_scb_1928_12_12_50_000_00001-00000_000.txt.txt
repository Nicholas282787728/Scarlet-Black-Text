Wherever they have played, they
have received enthusiastic press com»
nieiits. The Oklahoma City News
made the following report when Mr.
Dietcricb played there as soloist with
the Oklahoma City symphony: "Mr.
Dieterich, iii-st ’cellist ot the Sym—
nbon made a happy choice oi two
ent cl~ contrasting numbers as his
solos, The first, ‘Arioso‘ by Bach, gave
him an opportunity to display a tine
~singing tone and faultless intonation.
while the second, a ‘Rondo' by Boos
cliccriui, was played in true virtuoso
style."

The Tulsa World remarked that
"Mr. Noll's modern tone poems were
the distinctive message that he- gave
ievanescent‘fanciful—" According
to the Daily News at Brownwood,
Texas, “Delicacy of color, technical
accuracy and intelligent interpreta—
tion characterized Mr. Nolls' Work.”

The Daily Oklahoman reports that
”Carpenter has excellent intonation,
clean bowing, artistic phrasing and
graceful nuance; an obvious enjoys
ment in his work, too, that is quite
without ostentation. His musicianship
is sound.”

Rimester Tells Of Emancipation
Of Lowly Fresh In Indian Lore

The barbarian recedes. A last wild
war whoop punctures the night air
and the savage lurks off into the
darkened forest. The reverberating
roars of the awful beast who once
roamed the forest fastness in search
of his preyednd gluttlng his appetite
upon the blood of innocents, have
been strangely muted.

There is a clearing in the \vildWDod,
and it Iirc burns in its midst. A ﬁg
ure bends in a time honored attitude
near the heap of ﬂaming lagots, As
we watch, a wonderiul transforma—
tion comes over him, [or we see by
the flickering flames that the figure
bears all the semblance to a human
being. although he most resembled
some hunted creature of the Wild one
brief moment ago. We watch, and the
bent figure slowly rises to an upright
position, Furtive glances dart rapid-
ly in all directions. Reassuret‘l that
no one is high, this freshman, for
we now recognize this being as such,
extends his hands over the welcome
tire before him. In the midst or the
tire is a piece of wood, Wondrously
wrought and carved, and in shape
like unto a paddle, with many cracks
and many signs of Wear upon Its
time-Worn surface.

The freshman fixes his gaze upon

 

this object, and as the lire consumes
it, we sce a gradual process of meta-
morphosis creeping over the figure
beiore us, He seems to grow taller,
and broader, bigger In every way. He
paccs the them circle, and his step
grows tirin, his beari g surc, His
eyes lose their hunted glint; his
strained features relax, The wooden
instrument of torture disappears in a
puif of smoke and the watching fig
ure leaps into a wild dance

The call of the wild is silent. The
lust for blood has somehow been
subdued and quieted. The lord of the
forest no longer roars his awtul will
and shakes his mighty mane, resting
serene and puissant upon his haunch-
es as his humble subjects scurry to
work his will according to his dread
command. Here and there a tew rav—
cning wolves still prowl the forest
ways, making the night hideous wtih
their mournful howls. They skulk
about, making lamentations and lcer-
ing ivith bloodshot eyes upon the un—
sbacklcd one who was so short time
ago bound and helpless to their-
will, their lawful prey. But even
these will cease to spend their nights
in the expression of thwarted lust,
and they, too, will learn to live and
proiit by the new law of the forest

BUSH GIVES TALK

adoption was left for the meeting
