Pierce Describes
Life Of Schubert

Centennial of Composer‘s Death
Observed By Nation.

"1e ('enicnnlal oi' Schuheit's llcalh
is this Week being observed by luusi»
cal organizations throughout the
world, and the Slogan, “Baal: to
Melody} has been chosen to cum-
lneluorate those delightful melodies
of Schubert's which ilre so in con-
Hunt with many of the modern
thelnesi

Prof. George L. Pierce, director of
the School 01' Music, presented a
brief and interesting survey of the
life and accomplishments of Franz
Schubert in Chapel Monday. \‘ov. 19
which was the one hundredth anni-
versary or the composer’s death.

“In attempting to characterize the
genius ‘nf Schubert, wc lime to trike
into account the tact, now univer-
sally acknowledged ,that he was one
of the most richly endowed coin»
poser: known to musical history,”
Mr. Pierce said. His native skill was
such that only a. few lessons at the
beginning of his study sufficed to
Show his superiority in musical
things.

As'a composer we have heard of
him many times. but a fact new to
many of us is that, as a young boy,
Schubert bar] a beautiful voicex the
choral training that he received at
this time enabled him to Write Such
music [or the voice and in almost
any number of parts.

Prof. Pierce stated, "I believe it
is strictly Within bounds Ln say that
no other composer touched success
fully so many different ‘and widely
distant provinces of musical conir
position."

The most prominent characteristic
of Schubert's music is the sweet and
graceful melody. The piano part be—
ing an integral part of the dramatic
effect of a. Song; it is remarkable
that Schubert stands above all other
composer's in the skill with which he
plans his piano parts for intensifying
the dramatic impression of the song,

“He affords the most perfect illusr
tration of what is called 'inspirzuicn’
in music, of which we have recor
lir. Pierce declared. "His Work is a
combination of ease, naturaln s,
spontaneity, fertility of invention,
and extremely Wide range of sympa-
th)‘. He is,_ therefore, above all Dthr
ers of tbe'great masters. the tone
poet of the people and of all who love
defined melody and poetic music.”

Examples of Schubert's wonderful
music were displayed in the selecr
