in response to a reoi’ic from rariou Organizations
on the campus the scam? AND BLACK printing in
this issue a campus opinion on what rcpi sentatirc stu—
dents at Griiinell illllllt oi the small attendance at local
chui-chcs. A perusal or this column is interesting and.
ot coursc, valuable in that it contains a partial answer-
to a serious question that should he :lllsw ~cd at once.

The answer that the small attendance is duc to sheer

\\'(\tlllt\sll:l_i, liorenilior 12, lites.

inertia is probahly the most nearly correct. Sunday is
a nice tizly to sleep. That we lack the necessary parental
pi'odtllilg most certainly true. While the other answers
mai- or c the solution to the problem, it
seems to the writer that inertia is the answer as tar as
the aicrnge strident is concerned.

Griiiiicli is unusual in the nuiiihcr at activities that
arc open to the students Yet uitli.aii organic ion for
over} iiitci-cst iro do not hare a single clizmncl tor the
dcvclopiuent of the religious clement in our lives. The
associations are the only possible means at reaching out
and bringing the students into contact with religion. Yet
the small attendance at the Y. .\i. C. A, and Y. W. C, A.
lllccllllt: indicate the tutilitv of these channels. One pros
lessor intimates that vospcrs ma_ turnish the access
medium lQi' sp itual gronih Hc is right. How many
attend \‘OSDCLZ’ With the tailuic or all other means it
would seem that there exists no medium or bringing the
students and the church togethcr in the course at the
academic year. Going out of the college then, we see
that the local church is the only source availahic tor the
religious deielopineilt oi the student,

m:

it seems incongruous that so many students should
attend church regularly when at homc hut seldom, it
ever, so to clicurch while in (iripnell. The order ot sel'r
viccs is not so diticrciit. 'l'lle sermons may he ditrcrcnt.

going to their own tlciiammahonal church in the past
should :0 to the same churches in Gl'ilmell. 'l'lle apathetic
