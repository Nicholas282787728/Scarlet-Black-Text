THE BAND

When the class or 1928 announced that the class
gitt was to be given tor the support and maintenance
or the college band, the til-st step was talren ton ard put:
ting the band on a strong and permanent basis. \Vlico
eighteen incn responded lrom the treshman class to the
first call tor new students, a second step was talren in
insuring the iuturc ot the hand. However, there is a
third step to be taken. That step is in securing the urn
stihted cooperation or every student to support the or
ganization. ~

Heretotore the band has had no nnilol-m, the pie .
ers have been handicapped ’by the lack of music and in-
struments, the support due trom the student body has
been wholly lacking and the situation has not been en—
couraging for those who are giving their time and et-
tort.

However. tunds are available and material is glen»
titul for the ﬁrst time in years. There is a real incentive
for those who can play an instrument to appear at 13mm
tioe sessions.

There are two incidents that bring the situation
home to every student. one is a newspaper account at
a student who attended Griunell college ior two years.
He did not manifest any interest in the band. Shortly
otter his transfer to one of the largest universities in
the country, he was made drum major, or position that
few achieve in a great university.

Why didn't this student give his services to Grin»
nell as a musician? There seemed to be no incentive tor
him. Further than that he was actually discouraged by

men whose sole interest in the band was to talk against
it

the day-s of yore.

The return ot John Spencer recalls

THE GRINNELL SCARLE

The other incident was witnessed by every student
and raculty member in Grinnell. it was when the Grill-
noll college hand limped out on the iield between halves
oi d’lootbdll game. They had no uniiorms and their
number was small. on the contrary a smartly uniiormod
band drilled belore the stadium and was applauded lor
its appearance and hearing. Our band sotiercd by cone
parison.

The problem lacing every strident is whether men
who possess real ability will continue to remain llmc~
two when a little encouragement and cooperation will
cause them to be 01' invaluable service to the college.
and whether Gi'imiell will ever reel ashamed or its
showing when another school drills bctoro a homc
crowd. '

Through the generosity oi last year‘s class. money
is available, Eighteen men lroln Llle treslnnan class
alone angers well tor a good response to a general call.
The men as a group can do much by encouraging the
organization and giving it at least a small part or the
credit that it has coming.

A band is essential. Cooperation costs nothing ex—
eept a lair consideration of the organization and a shove
in the right direction.

.1 1‘. lellrli 0N OUTSIDE ACTIVITII‘L .

We are altering a reprint of an article entitled “Tile
Sad Tale oi a Camel" which was printed in this column
last year,

"Did you ever hear the story or the obliging camel?
it scms that one oi these stately beasts or our
den was being loaded for a long caravan trip across the
desert, The owners at the caravan tound that they
had quite a lut oi surplus baggage to ialre, and as the
camel in question was at sturdy dimensions and had a
hind race, the starlod to put some or the extra weight
upon him. First they hoisted up or little anvil by means
or nine men and a derrieir, and made it last to the calm
baclr. our animal hcro lrcpt climviilg his cud with pride
at the contidcnce thus reposed in him, and signiiicd his
dcsirc to carry an even greater load.

Next the drivers lilted up a couple or s lrs or wheat.
each or them about the belt or a moderate—sized [0min
stone. and added them to the czllilcl’s burden. Still he
made no complaint. and it in. back began to see a little
bit in the middle, no one noticed it.

The next item to go up was a mammoth bale oi hay,
\\'lilch,\vi~ts tied to the camel’s bach without evicting even
the flicker ol an eyelash ilom. him. Even then all
might have been well had not one oi the owners, who
was a Scotcbman, pielrod up a tiny wisp ol buy that was
iiuttering about on the ground. and tossed it onto the
camel's baclr. The extra weight did the business. and
the noble ship or the desert crashed to the ground like a
Phi Beta Kappa thinking an examination."

There is a detinite moral to this 'story for the posh-
men and the upperclossmen who read this article. For
the treshmen we can point out the value or choosing
a course or study with a detinite aim in mind and devoting
every energy to getting as much out or the course as
possible. There are organizations termed tor men and
women interested in the same thing he i . Participation
in those things that are or value and have some correla—
tion with his tleld or concentration is advisable. But
the average treshnian should be earetul not to be blinded
by the appeal or popularity and the consequent subordina-
tion or the more worth—while things.

The w ter is a rim believer in the system ot limit-
ing participation in outside activities as a great many
great universities do. A greater number of men will he
developed as leaders and a greater efficiency will be
noticed in the wnrir of the leaders.
