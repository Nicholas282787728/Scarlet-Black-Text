Direction of Play Staged
Here Last) Night.

HUSTON TAKES NORA ROLE

Wohlgemuth Plays Torvald Hel~
mer With Individuality;
Gray Is Convincing.

By penile w. starrett.

Seldom does Grinnell have the or»
portunity of attending a play in whictr
the totality of effect is so well vital-
izetl without serious iiaws. as it was
in Henrik ibsen's “A Doll's House,"
in which the Experimental Theatre
presented the Grinneli college Dra-
matic club last evening at the Colon-
ial theatre. Above the convincing
character interpretation of the actors
must be placed the vivid realism
which the direction or ottilie Turn-
bull Seybolt made possible.

Hustou's Impulsireuess I’lollsiiig.

Emphasizing a charactencomplica
tion plot built arorrnd a forged note
and a dying husband, Ibsen has cre
ated a role in Nor-a which few per-
sons could have interpreted u no a line
er. more genuine and subtler under--
standing than Hope Huston, Though
carrying a role which was burdened
with lengthy speeches calling for
studied interpretation, Miss Huston
conducted her role with absolute clar»
ity, sincerity, and surety. Particular.
ly pleasing was the iiltpillsiie realism
w ich Miss Huston put into her parr-
tomimc during the many occasions
presented. Her varied facial expr-
ions. manual gestures, and bodily
movements afforded a welcome relief
to the prim staidness of (‘ilr tina
Linden as played by Helen Gertrude
'Ei'oun. One feels the warmth, tend-
el'ness, and ‘childishuess of the Nora
role were genuine.

Though consistently good. i ss
Brown was evenly commonplace until
the love awakening of Christina Line
den and Nils Krogstad at the opening
of the third act. Miss Brown seemed
to awaken personally to the emotional
feeling of the scene. At other times
she was distinctly, obviously out' of
character.

Wol'llcgemuili Redeems Self.

Not until the tarantella dance scene
at the close of the second act did the
character lead of Torvald Helmer.
played by 0thmer Wohlgemuth. rise
to a convincing pert. During the first
half Mr. Wohigemuth seemed timid
and fearful of Nora. unaware of the
connubial surety of the relations of a
husband to a wile. This, added to in-
distinct articulation and faltering and
stumbling in his speeches, displeased
the spectator much and over-enhanced
the splendid, though subordinate, in—
terpretation of the parts of Nils Krog-
stad and Dr, Rank, as played by Rus—
sell Gray and Lysle Hartley respect-
ivel

Foituiiately Mr. Wohlecmuth
more than redeemed himself in the
tarantella dance scene of Hellner.
Nora. and Dr. Rank. Helmer seems
ed to catch the vivacious tone of the
scene and to retain the spirit of the
role until the final curtain. Hclrner
rebuked Nora with more genuine feel-
ing, more intensity. It was not until
the last scene of act two that Mr.
Wohlgemuth made use of his splendid
opportunities of pantomime and in-
dividual delineation ot character The
character of Torvald Helmer is excel-
lent when imitating to Christaln Line
den the way a lady ernbroiders and
knits. A pleasing ease and undone
sciousness oi the stage malrcs the part
full of mirth, Except for a slight. oc-
casional overly melodramatic hissing
ot the lines. Tor-void was played by
Mr Wohlegmuth with sympathy and
individuality. The climactic scene or
the third act between Nor-a and Tor-
vaid was played with a skill which
produced a silence proiound enough
to make the ticking of the clock on
the set audible.

)linor Leads Commeitddlilo.

Too much credit cannot be attri-
buted to the two male minor leads.
Nils Krogstad, played by Russell
Gray. and Dr. Rank, carried by Lysle
Hartley. Both roles were consistent-
ly in character during the whole play.

Heads League Board;
Government Endorsed

Frances Propp was elected pl'esir
dent of the Women's League Board for
1928—5) at a mass meeting of the u'ome
on in the quadrangle theatre on
Wednesday evening. Carolyn Smith
was elected viceepresidenl.

_The newly elected president was
representative on the League board in
her freshman and sophomore years.
she was on the Y. M. C. A. cabinet in
her sophomore year and is a member
of the cabinet as treasurer this year.
She was also a member of the W. A.
A. board this year.

Cttl'olhi Smith has been on the
SCARLET AND BLACK staff for three
years and is a member of Theta sigma
Phi.

Dean Luella J. Read opened the
meeting with a talk in which she pro-
pounded the question to the girls of
whether or not they wished student
government. Consequently the women
voted for strident government and the
election followed. The action on the
part of Miss Read came as a result
of the expression of dissatisfaction in
a letter to the SCARLET AND BLACK
Wednesday written by the women in
Cottage Two.

Pﬂﬂﬁﬂlw MONDAY

Interpreter of Negro FolkeTarles
To Present Closing Number
0n Lecture Course,

Monday night will mark the close oi
the college lecture course for the year
when Miss Lucine Finch is presented
in an interpretation of negro folk-
tales in Herrick- chapel at eight
o'cloclr. Mi Finch appeared in Grin-
Ilell several 3 HTS ago.

The program to be presented that
night centers about the portrayal or a
"maroon" oi the old South. an inter-7
pretation which gives the artist an on
portunity to express the whole range
of emotions from burner to pathos. It
is said that the best and strangest or
the stories which Miss Finch will
give are those of a religious nature:
in them a tram work of Old Testa-
ment narrative is twisted to hold the
pagan demouology of the negro, sof-
tened by the intimate color oi plantdr
tion life.

Miss Finch is her-self a Southerner
who comes from an old Louisiana fam-
ily. The character she is to interpret
was a servant in her family tor three
generations, a fact which enables her
to present an unusually realistic pic-
ture of a true negro "mamilly" and to
impart the stories which she heard as
a child.

Arthur Brisbane and James O'Don-
ncil Bennett have enthusiastically
commended Miss Finch's programs.
She has spoken. beiore many college
audiences. ‘

Are Veterans; Stowe, Jones
Foil Experienced.

A tentative trip to Oklahoma and
Texas during spring vacation and an-
other to Indiana and Michigan during
the wcek-ehd of May 5 will be includ»
ed in the schedule of a tennis team
which should be one or the bestwhich
has ever represented Grinnell.

Thesouthern tour will includeative—
match schedule with Oklahoma uni-
versity, Oklahoma Aggies. Texas
university. Rice Institute and Baylor.
The eastern trip will include meets
with Marquette. Notre Dame, Michiv
gan State. and one or two other
schools to be announced later. John C.
Trucsdalc, director of athletics, stated
yesterday. ,

An attempt is being made to book
home duals with the University of
Iowa, Drake and Ames. The season
will be ended with the Missouri Val—
ley mcet which will be held in con-
nection with the conference track
meet May 10 and 20.

All Have Impressive Records.

Pioneer tennis prospects are rosy.
Besides a nucleus of Coggoshall, stru-
ble and Lovejoy, three oi the four on
last yo; '5 squllfl which made the
best showing oi any team in the Val-
ley, there are Stowe, Jones and Fail, all
men with impressive records behind
thorn, to fight it out for the other
position,

Numerous champions and near
champions will garner the squad.
Coggesball is Missouri Valley singles
champion. champion of Iowa and Ne-
braska and ex-champion in junior
Iowa singles. Since he has worn the
Scarlet and Black colors he has lost
no singles matches and two doubles
matches, One defeat was administers
ed in the iinals of the Valley doubles
tournament and the other in a battle
with a Washington university team.

Struble has a similar Valley rec-
ord. He has lost two singles matches
in his two years of competition We ’
ciusive of the Conference tournament,
He reached the finals in the Missis-
sippi Valley meet last snrnmer. Love-
ioy, the other man has lost two
matches in two years of competition
for Grinnell.

The other place on the team will be
taken by one of three men, all of
whom have impressive records be-

champion. has the brightest net his»
tor-y behind him. He is former junior
champion or Iowa and rnnnerup to
Coggeshall for the high school singles
championship three years ago, He al»
so held the Southwest Iowa singles
titlc one year. He plays a "cut"
game. depending on placements and
accuracy rather than speed to win. He
has, however, a driving game which
he can use on occasion.

Jones. runner up to Stone in the
tall intramural tournament. plays an
impressive game which has improved
rmrch in the last year. He depends
on a driving game to win, having
strong fore and backhand strokes and
cannonhall service.

Coggeshall spent last summer melt-
ing good records. Among his achiever
ments was a victory over Harada.
Japanese Davis Cup star. in an invite-

points of beating Alfred H. Chapin
