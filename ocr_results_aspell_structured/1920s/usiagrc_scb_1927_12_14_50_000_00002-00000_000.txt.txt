I’EIISONAL OPINION IN REV! ‘ VING.

Every person has the right to express his personal
opinion on a suhyect. It is a well known fact that no two
people possess the same character or the some mind, and
naturally no two people will respond alike to a given
question. Some people respond favorably to red color and
some untavorabiy. One person will enjoy an entertain-
ment and another one will have just the opposite reeling
towards it. The Same is true or any organization, and any
newspaper. A newspaper man sends a man to review a
concert, an entertainment, or a play, and the editor ex-
pects that man to write his honest opinion on the pro
grarn he attends; not the opinion of the audience, but the
‘reviewei": own reaction. A sincere reviewer will submit
to the editor what was asked for, whether it be tavorablo
or unfavorable. Perhaps the reviewer was wrong in
what he says. but is is only a personal opinion.

it is much better tor a man to give an accurate ac
count of his response to an entertainment than to be
false and compliment every person appearing on the pro-
gram, such a review is not only unlair to the reviewer
but to the readers of the paper. The majority of people,
at least the Iibel'alemiuded ones, honor a man who has
the courage of his convictions, a man who will say frankr
ly that he does or dues not like a certain thing. There
is no reason to take oftence when a man does express his
opinion as long as he does not alter the tacts. The reader

is not required to believe the reviewer.

The writeup ol the play “Seventh Heaven, reviewed
in the lust issue of tllis paper-,‘was entirely the opinion
of the reviewer concerning the play itseli, Tile Com»
miinity club was thoroughly exonerated in the t' sent-
EIICDS‘ of the review. If the article has hceil misunder-
stood, it the Community club has taken it as a relleetion
upon its efforts, we beg to apologize. We consider the
l‘oninliinity club one of the best things in Grinncil and
iiill do all we can to back its plays. The Community
club is subject to errors in judgment, even as we seem
to be, and the college students think just as much of the
cigar tion now as they did before the production of
"Seventh Heaven,”

5' 'l'llENT PUBLICATIONS.

Grinliell college ofiers to her students who are inter-
ested in journalism, an excellent opportunity for expel-r
icncc in tilis tieid of activity. The SCARLET AND BLACK,
llc lllnlteaser, the Cyclone, and the Tanager represent many
different phases of w ilng, v -ying irorii news stories,
editorials, humorous articles to the more artistic work
used by the Cyclone and the s ictly literary writing ac-
cepted by the Tanager.

The Grinncll Tanager, this year has attracted con-
siderable interest throughout this section at the country.
Although it has at times been criticised somewhat severe»
ly, perhaps, such on cisnl has only served to bring more
attention to the magazine, The Tanager is the one pubs
licotion on the campus that giv s students an opportunity
[or more serious literary creative iv lung. Probably one
of the most pleasing things about Grinnell journalism and
the publishing of the Tanager is the [act that the faculty
is in sympathy with them.

Such a sympathetlc feeling seems to be lacking at
Drake university. Only last year a student was expelled
from that university, mainly because the Quax was not
dedicated to the right person. There were probably other
reasons, but this seemed to be the start of the fracas,
Last week the Drake campus experienced another jour»
nalistic fracas. The controversy between administration,
facility, and student body this time was a result of the
proposed establishment or a literary magazine at Drake
university. The outcome nearly ended in the suspension
or Wendell Webb, associate editor of the Drake Delphic.

For some time, Drake has been endeavoring to es-
tablish a literary magazine, but the proposition, although
favored by some members of the faculty failed to gain
the support of Professor Smith, head of tile English de-
partment Just why Professor Smith is opposed to such
a magazine we do not khoiv. Perhaps the Drake journal-
ists hare not undertaken the proposal in accordance witll
college regulations, and in this case tlle actions of Pro»
lessor Smith are explained.

However, this does not seem to be the explanation.
From Mr. Webb's statement in which he said that, “I can-
not accept Professor Sinitll's attitude toward the proposed
literary magazine all-eddy endorsed by other laculty
members. I realize that it is not becoming or proper for
a student subject to the rules of an institution. to critic .e
d lacully member, in his posi 'oil of responsibility, in
terilis of equality," we gathered that not only is llr. Webb
a gentleman but that Professor Smith does ilot approve
of the establishment of ti literary magazine on the Drake
campus, This is only another incident that places Grin-
nell's liberal mindedness in a favorable light.

improvement.

merit in English and Journalism class-

It should have a strong editorial poli-
cy, and not be just a crab sheet.

paper.

Prof. H. s. COlIlirll—There is plenty
