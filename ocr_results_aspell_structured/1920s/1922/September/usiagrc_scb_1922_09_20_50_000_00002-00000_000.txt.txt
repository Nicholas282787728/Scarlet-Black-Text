Aug. so, 1922.
My dear girls 0[ the w. A. A. Board:
This glorious sunny morning finds
me sitting on a melt on the cllfls
which line the shore or the little island
of Bornholm, Denmark, in the Bal-
tie sen. I feel completely out or the
world, tor this is a very remote spot,
and the little village in which Miss
Long and 1 are spending a resttul
week, is the most quaint spot one can
imagine. This is my tnther's birth-
‘place, and I could not bear to pass
by. Indeed, when 1 was seven yeurs
old, I spent one year here, with my
father and mother, and I remember-
very well, the house in which we
lived, and some of my playmates.
Last evening we were invited to the
home ot the one who was my best

friend, and we had a. most delightful:
