The question lifts often been asked.
“is ii collehe education worth the time

man or woman who is getting the,

education. Sonic or them have very
little to show tor the time spent in
collcsc, but these are few. Whether
or not the four years Spent willlill

entirely on tho student, ”We livc in a

where also tell us the investment in
a liberay arts education pays well in
an intangible or spiritual way. It
enables a man or woman to get vast»

allowed to spend here. It pays in

don't actually learn a great deal in
college: we simply learn how to
