HﬂLﬂ FﬂHMAL [IPENING ,
[IF NEW SﬂHﬂﬂL

Building Tastefully Decorated
With Flowers Furnished by
the Pupils.

A large crowd took advantage or
the opportunity to inspect the new
High ,School at the lormal opening
last evening. From 5 o'clock to 10
o'clock a consmnt stream of parents
and interested citizens was pouring
through the corridors, visiting the
class rooms, admiring the many feat-
ures and splendid equipment of the
building.

The teachers from all the schools
were on hand to show the visitors
about and answer their questions.
The grade and high school teachers,
who are located in the new huilding,
were in their classrooms to receive
the parents or their pupils and other
lriends. .

The whole building was tastefully
decorated with bouquets oi beautiful
,llowers, iurnishcd for the occasion by
lthe boys and girls of the school. The
thcautirully lighted gymnasium came
‘iu for many enthusiastic comments,
lespecially on the part or those who
are followers cl basketball. The
roomy auditorium received its full
share of admiration also. The stage
was lighted by colored lootli‘ghts.
which with the rich drapes and heavy
curtains added a certain bizarre el—
lect that was both novel and pleas-
ing. The domestic science and man-
ual training departments were open
for inspection and the visitors were
even allowed to look in on the much—
inery of the heating plant which is
thoroughly equipped with the most
modern appliances.

The girls in the domestic science

 

 

department served tl‘appe and wafers
during the reception period. The
members of the school board, who
were largely responsible {or the
character and features or the build»
ing, were Present with broad
smiles on their faces greeted the
Visiting public., They made admir-
able hosts and everyone Went awayi
expressing their sincere appreciation
DI the opening and their enthusiasm
over the new High School building
which is Glnlllhell’s.

STEINER SPEAKS
AT Y. M. MEETING

Makes Strong Plea for Clean Liv-
ing, Thinking and Talking.

Speaking before one of tho’largcst
crowds that ever packed into the Y.
M. c. A. building Thursday evening.
Dr. Steiner addressed the men oi the
college on the importance or living
clean, thinking clean, and talking'
clean.

"Vulgar speech has no place in the
vocabulary of a college man," declar-
ed the speaker, “for he is supposed
to know how to express himseli in
the pure mother tongue of sunke-
speare, Milton and Scott" The doc-
tor then went on to deplore the one
clean hztllits that creep into the lilo
or a college man' and told how those
things might he overcome by the
hunch 0! follows getting to—gether
and discussing the higher thing's lu
lite and society.

Every man that heard Dr. Steiner
was mighty pleased by the way in
which he so ably approached the sub-
icct, and then so sppcalingly present
ed the problem. Dr. Steiner will
again till]: tn the men of the college
next Thursday at 7 5 in the Y. M. C.
A. building. It is hoped that a record

breaking 01'0er will again greet the
speaker.

BONUS BILL FIJI llP .
Tl] EHAHDING

Much Speculation as to Fate of
Bill After Senate Finally
Puts It In His Hands.

By a vote of so to 17, the senate
passed the bonus bill Friday after—
noon, putting it up to the ﬁnal will of
the President. The twoethirds mas
jority was unexpected, but since nearly
hall 91' the senators were absent, this
majority may not stand in case Presi-
dent Harding vetoes the bill. It is
very probable that the President will
refuse to sign the bill. He announced
o while ngn,that he would veto the
bill, and many members oi the house
voted for the hill to satisly home
contingents, but expecting the Persi-
dent's veto to kill it. The President
will undoubtedly sign or veto the bill

immediately so that congress will be}

able to take a vacation as soon as

possible.
