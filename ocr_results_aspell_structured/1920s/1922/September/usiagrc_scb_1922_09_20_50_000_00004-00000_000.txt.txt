Urges Students to Enter Into Out
side‘ Activities in chapel
Talk Monday.

To gain the most 1mm life we
should live it to its fullest extent was
the message or Mr. Lovell in a chapel
tail: on Monday. Enter into college
life by going to chapel and vespers,
going to all the ineeﬁngs you can,
and reading the Scarlet and Black, in

order to get out of college life the ’

most and best that it can give. some
out or the shell which encloses you;
learn to know people, and let people
learn to‘ know you.

Referring to the quotation trom
Shakespere, “All the world's a stage,
and all the men and women are mere-
ly players." Mr. Lavell said that
while in a sense it is true and we

have a definite part. in life to pluy,‘ :‘-

yet We are given the power to direct
our lives to follow the course We may
choose Rather than puppets whose
thoughts and actions muct he guided

by a mere pulling or a string we are: ‘

in reality the ”contain of our soul."
