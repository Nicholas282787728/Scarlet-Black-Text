PLATFORM ABILITY AND
GASES GAIN DECISIONS

Local Debate Becomes Struggle
As To Deﬁnition of Terms —
‘ Teams Show Up Well.

i

The 1922 debate season was closed
with a double victory for Grinircll
when Cue was defeated in a dual
last Thursday night. By reason of
their hetlcr platform ability and more
organized attack and defense, the
Gr nnell irrcn walked away with a 2-1‘
decision on the local platform while
they. gained a unanimous victory at
Cedar Rapids. The question was "Re-
solved, that the closed shop in indus—
try is Justiﬁnble.”

The Grionell negative team which
went to cedar Rapids was made up
of Henry Vogler, Carlos Rowlison and
Clay Harshbargev. They were unis
for-.mly excellent in their work and
were the unquestioned victors. The
affirmative team which debated here
was George Harnagel, Harry Rey»
nolds, and w am Vogler while w.
Lawrence Shir-er. Ralph A. Feet, and
Walter N. Applegren upheld the neg’
ative for coo. Professor Edward B. T.
Spencer presided.

As ﬁrst speaker for the affirmative.
Harnagel based the case on four
terms: ﬁrst, that the policy of thc
closed shop in industry is justiﬁable
for it is in accord witir the law of the
land; second, that it is beneﬁcial to the
public; third, that it is beneﬁcial to
the employer; and fourth. that it is
beneﬁcial to labor. Much time was
spent by the opening speaker in de-
ﬁning the terms of the question which
later proved to be the topic of the

debate rather than the question as
stated, .liuch ouibbliug cver term “in
industry" took place, the affirmative
declaring that it meant only those in-
dustries in a restricted ﬁeld where the
closed shop is in existence or where
it can be put into existence. That
ﬁeld, they declared, was restricted to
the highly developed and orga ' ed
trade unions rather than the whole
ﬁeld of industry as maintained by the
negative team,

The negative based their issues on
‘the facts that the proposed plan was
unnecessary, ethically unsound, and
cannot be applied. At no time during
the course of the debate did the two
sides come‘to anything near an agree.
ment on the issues of the debate.
Both sides stuck to their own case
'thrnout the evening, the whole debate
turning on the interpretation of the
term "in industry."

William vogler perhaps did the best
work for Grinnell in his ﬁrst speech.
although much credit must also be
given to Reynolds and Harnngel for
their rebuttals. The strongest speak-
er for see was undoubtedly Walter
Applegren who ably attacked the case
of the affirmative.

The judges of the debate were Prof.
John M. Thurber, Iowa State College;
