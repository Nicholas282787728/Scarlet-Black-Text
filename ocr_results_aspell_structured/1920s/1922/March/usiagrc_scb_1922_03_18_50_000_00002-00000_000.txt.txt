THE I’RDIROSE PATH

It the average college student were
asked to point out the most striking
feature of the modern educational
system, he would doubtless choose the
elective system. Based on the theory
that the individual is himself best able
to pick his own ﬁeld of activity, the
plan has been generally applied in
American institutions and has revolu-
tionized methods by adding flexibility
to the curriculum. However, this
system has one serious flaw in that
it encourages to
choose the line of least resistance.

ways. In choosing hls work, the man

unquestionably due to mental
physical laziness and the unwilling-
ness to work for a degree has been
one of the main points in the attack
methods by
business men of today. ‘AS a. result.
the hahitue of the primrose path is
extremely unpopular and may soon he

exterminated. .

Again, granting that the seeker for
easy knowledge (lees occasionally mis-
judgc a course, or is torced by peace.
sity to take something which requires
effort, he frequently resorts to another
line of least resistance: that of crih.
hing. This practice bclongs to the
mental \vcakling, the man who is the
capable of grinding out for himself
sufficient knowledge to get through an
examination. It has no place in the
modern college altho it presents a
very deﬁnite problEH‘l to the majority
of institutions.

Here in Grinnell, strenuous efforts
are being made to improve under.
graduate conditions and to remedy the
evils of our educational system. This
work is being carried on by a com—
mittee from the Strident Council,
working with the (acuity, nltho as yet
no results are obtainable. Every cf-
I'ort should be made to make the prim—
rose path a thorny one and an ef-
fective barricade should soon be erectr
ed here, In such case, both the cribs

THE FOUR POWER TREATY

The Four Power Treaty, a product
of the Washington Conference for the
Limitation of Armaments, has been
Ilndergolllg, the vicissitudes of Sena.-
torial consideration and has been the
means of revealing many of the inade-
quacies ot our present system of trea—
ty ratiﬁcation. ll hall of the reserva—
tions and amendments proposed by
the august members of the Senate had
been incorporated in the terms of the
treaty, it would be wholly unrecog-
nizable as the same pact which was

sideration and approval. While the
senate unquestionably is it policy he
terinining body and has uic right to
accept or reject a treaty, yet to ad-
lnit to it the right to redraft an agree
ment or to add reservations Which‘
would change the meaning would be'
to surrender the management of for
Cign affairs to a group that is grossly
incapable. i
As an example, the Senate prevented ,

l
the United States rrom subscribing tel

the Versailles treaty and new that the}
Four Power pact, which is greatly,
similar to the previous one, is up tori,
consideration not even party loyalty‘
has prevented a group of Republicanl
Sellalors, assisted by a few Dem—
ocratic colleagues, from attacking and
hindering the ratiﬁcation of this agree»
ment. Apparently oblivious of the Oils
ligation Which they owe to the peonle
of the United States, the members of
the “Irreconcilable” group have bat-
tled furiously, eloquently and inunely
on the subject of the treaties now be-
fore the Senate. They have succeed-
ed admirably in making themselves
ridiculous both at home and abroad.

As a result of this agitation, Sena.
tor Lenrout has issued a warning that
the treaties may he wihdrawn from
consideration and submitted by Presi-
dent Harding for popular approval at
the coming Congressional election.
Undoubtedly this statement was the
product of debate for action
would be a mistake since a. popular
election would not be based on the
merits of the treaties but on party
prejudices. This was proven by the
Presidential election of 1920 which was
a great Success in the Way of paying
off old scores and wreaking political

such

vengeance, but was a dismal failure
as a referendum on the League of Na-
tiuns. " .

The place (or the raudcation of the
treaties is in the Senate and now that
March 2i hits been set as the day for
the ﬁnal vote, that seems to he the
logical time. And now, too, since the
deteat of the Robinson Amendment, it
begins to look as though party poll—
tics would be tor-gotten by the neces-
sary two thirds majority oi the Senate
for a long enough period to permlt
the sanctioning ot the Four Power
and other trenlies.

EDUCA’J‘ED rooms

There is a type of man found around
every university which might be char.
acterizcd as belonging to the “educa.
ted fool” group. The students who can_
be said to come under the heading mo
easily distinguished from the remaind—
' they
[like pains to malle themselves notice;
able. The majority of them have cc.
centricitics carefully cultivated so that
they will he brought to the attention
of the remainder of the students. in
some cases it will be an affected ac-

er of the undergraduates, for

cent, while in others still ln0le loolish
peculiarities are noticeable.

It is hard to explain the reason why
these men go to such great pains to
be a tiﬁcial in their manners at all
times: it must lie that they wish to
attain prominence in some way, and,
lacking sufficient intellectual develop-
ment to do so, they attempt to attract
attention by their prepared list of
tricks which they will quite willingly
perform for any audience whatsoever.
From the courses which they are role
lowing at the university they have
picked up a. little superﬁcial knowl-
edge, and, carefully noting the points
or interest in something not at all con-
nectcd with their wnrll, they will bore
the remainder of their classes Wltli
continual repetitions of empty phrases
and borcsomc conversations. Art ol-
music seems to be a favorite topic for

 

them. With a few facts gathered from

the weekend papers, they are ready in
dictate concerning the qualities of a
picture or an opera, to the genuine
disgust of anyone who is really con-
versant with the subjects.
Ii these men were only injuring
themselves we would, have no com-
lalnt to make about their actions, for
no one bothers about the actions or
an idiot. They can do no harm to the
thinking men about them, lor they are
more an object of amusement than
anything else. They are. however,
dangerous to the younger and m" e
impr ionztble students at the

versity. The under-graduates who are

lini-

making the transition to the state of
manhood will be seriously affected in
after life by the impressions they re
crive at college. Many or these cane
not distinguish between the slight ve-
neer of sophistication which covers the
vapid mind, on the one hand, and the
deeper, thoughtful student who does
not need to seek attention, on the

other. °

There can be harm done by the
group in question, and that is the only
reason for giving them‘ any attention
whatsoever. It is too much to expect
that the men themselves can ever be
changed; it would take it higher be

the case, we can only pray that the
