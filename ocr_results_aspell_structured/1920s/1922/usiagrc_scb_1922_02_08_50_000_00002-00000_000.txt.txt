sence rule and presenting a. more
modiﬁed term or the rule then was
previously anticipated when the col-
lege year opened. This new statement
is published in response to petitions
from the-Student Council and the Lao»
tern asking tor a reconsideration of
the ruling as it lirst appeared.

_._G__.._

PLAY iI‘HE Gm:

Every sport has its rules. The
whole system of sports and of inter-
collegiate cumpetition is based on reg»
ulntiens which are corelully drafted
and explained to everybody concerned
in order that each may ploy- Lhe gene
according to a. certain set of instruc-
tions, \

However, it is not the sport and the
game alone that has its set ot “do and
don’t's.“ There are also certain defi—
nite, altho unwritten, rules of etiquette
that have been evolved for the hang-
ere—on, the side-liners, or the meters.
These can for as strict ohsewonce on
the part of the participants as do the
rules leidl‘down for the players.

Modern athletics is based on clean
competition and the reputation orhoth
a team and e school depends on tbe
sincerity with which they enforce the
laws, both Written and unwritten,
which make intersobelnstic contests
possible.

it is essential that everybody recog-
one the authority of the Official in
charge. It usual y happens that the
referee is the most thoroughly in~
formed man on the ﬂoor or the ﬁeld
and any attempt to dictate the rules
or the game is n decided ioiringemcnt
on his authority, and w th no accep-
table excuse. The willingness of a.
crowd to hoot a. decision or to jeer an
individual player is indisputable evi-
dence that something is lacking in the
school Which permits such an infringe-
men! and such an insult. Contesting
of a decision or an audible suggestion
to the coaches or the players is de-
cidedly out or place and should he re
stricted to one's own room, The
whole theory of the code or sports-
manship for the spectator is “don‘t in-
tertere. Root all you want tn, but let
the responsible parties assume their
own positions," don’t attempt to home
your own opinion upon 8. for more
competent authority than yourself.

in addition to the rules or conduct
that should apply to renters in the
stands and on the sidelines, there are
certain rules or hospitality that
Should be remembered at all times.
The visiting team is the guest 0! the
college with which it competes. NO‘
matter what the outcome of the con-
test, tbeguests should be treated with
the utmost courtesy and every effort
made to promote their comlort. Any
loilure in either at these lines is an

for world service, then they must
have at background on which to build
and must have a. breadth of view and
of interests that is beyond that or the
average undergraduate.

The gist of Sir Philip Gibhs' speech
lny in the stress which he put upon
the need for the aid of America in
settling the problems of the world

. and the faith that Europe -has in

America's response to her plea. To an-
OEDt means that the United States
must abandon all ideas or nationalism
and of isolation and must join -in a
great cooperative movement which
shall beneﬁt the entire \Vol'ld, include
ing ourselves. If we are [0 train on?-
selves for leadership and positions ui
responsibility in this new work, then
we must get away from our own nar—
row limitations and strive for a per-
spect ve, now, that will be or service
later, “‘8 must get beyond the limits
of narrow partisanship and train BUY-
selves for cooperative work and real
service.

That the older men, the lenders of
today, are realizing the necessity for
cooperation, is shown by the events
which have been going on around us.
The Weshlugtoh disarmament confer-
ence in a direct product oi this new
spirit. Which llil‘. Balfour, the English
leader, voiced when he said that Sim-
illltr meetings should follow the one
just closed. According to his state—
ment, he was satisﬁed at the success
ol the money and of the method and
believed that the solution or world
problems lay in a frank and coopera—
live consideration of vital problems.
Another. instance of this DEW Spirit
of lion-partisanship, perhaps even
more signiﬁcant, is that Of Will H.
Hnys, iormerly chairman nf.\the Re.
pnhlican national committee and now
postmaster general in President
Harding‘s cabinet, who heads the list.
of Washington republicans who have
silhscribed t0 the million dollar fund
which is being raised as the Woodrow
Wilson Foundation.

in the light of present events, these
actions are particularly signiﬁcant in
their meaning tor lhe college men and
women who intend to be active in
world anon There is n Vely deﬁr
nltc need tor people who are wide
awnlre to the trend or events, who are
sufficiently broad in their views to
get beyond the nationalistic stage,
and who are willing to moire some
sacriﬁces in order to achieve their ul-
timate goal in world service.

The whole trend or national anilin—
ternntionnl events is to show the u.
lessness oi n narrow, partisan view-
point, and to prove the beneﬁts or co—
operation find or lirendtli of vision and
or views, This ideal holds not only

 

in international ntfairs, however, but

 

ache was, it was overlooked for a
while, but all the consulting phys'le
clans were positive that a more Stem»
acb ecbe could not cause such e snp—
plng of energy as was evidenced by
the weakened condition or the Grinnell
Spirit. And now it has been found.
an operation my be necessary. For-
tunately the operation will not ‘ene
danger tbe life of the Grinnell Spirit,
to the contrary it will be almost pain»
less and the consulting physicians are‘
unanimous that once perioroned the
Grinnell Spirit will show astonishing
signs of life end virility. if those two
are not synonymous terms.

The trouble is this, hidden in the
vltnls of tbe Grinnell Spirit is a me—
bgnent tumor. That sounds bad. It
is bed but not as bed as it sounds.
by which the consulting physicians
onree that nltho deleterious to the
system it can be easily removed.

This tumor consists or an enlorge—
ed idea of the piece that'nthletics and
athletes hold in the life of the Col—
lege. That is putting it bluntly to he.
sure, but in matters Of this kind it is
always best to know the worst.

it would of course be folly to pro-
nonnce this diegnosls without a
knowledge ol the facts. Here they
are in black nod white.

1. Athletes get it majority share or“
the scholarships offered by the Trusr
tees through the Graduate Council.

2. Athletes receive levers at the
hands of the Administration.

3. Athletes must hove hrst choice
0! jobs.

And conversely.

1. Those who have ”talent" if not
genius to utter roost pay their own
way.

2. Those who have ”mlent" if not
genius are persons non grate when
favors are nslred.

3. Those who have "talent" it not
nenllls can built their Jobs elsewhere
than in the college office.

CASE 1. There are twenty scholar.
ships offered yearly by the Trustees
ot the College. The Graduate Council
submits candidates subject to the ape
prove! of the Trustees. Ostensihly
the choice is made on the basis or

Scholarship plus athletic ability, to he . ..

more strictly accurate the choice is
made on the hosts of Athletic ability
plus scholarship. It is opparent that
scholarship played a. rather Small part
in the choice of candidates this year
for at the end of the semester only
one had an A or n nverage, one re-
ceived rovers at the blind of the od-
minlstmuont see below) and is above
the board, and eighteen dunked out in
one thing or another and in some
cases in Lhree or tour things. There
is not tbe vestlge or talent or genius
