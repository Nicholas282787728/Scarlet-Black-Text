In considering the workings of the

heen considerable discussion as to its’
virtues and defects, as to the. justice
or the injustice of It. The matter has
naturally been an important one with

the seniors,wiil he affected by it in
cases ot frequent absence from class-
es.

The rule, as it now holds, provides a
penalty‘for ahsence from class,. l'e~
gardlesscf excuse, and makes it nec
essary for the student to carry ektra
work for graduation if the force of
circumstances causes him to miss
more than eighteen hours of unexcus~
ed work a semester. In case of ille
nose or for other good reasons this
ruling provides for half penalty, with
the same ultimate resultsextra work
for graduation.

A ruling of'this sort is an ,innova-
tion in Grinnell and its worthhas to
be proved. 0n the face of it, it has

many beneﬁcial features and also
many defects. There can be no ques-
tion that the action of the faculty in
this matter has resulted in a much
better attendance at classes than was
in previous
years when there was no penalty for
cutting. On the other hand, there are

numerous cases in school where the

Experience inlother colleges and

‘ universities has proven the worth of a

“cut system," and there can he no
question that it is of value in any in-
stitution. However, the question of
an "absence system" is another nint-
ter. Is it just to penalize the student
for unavoidable ahsences from class,
such as those necessitated by illness,
or by work in hehall of the college
such as that of the athletic teams 01‘-
of those who are working on debate,
and on the college publications? The‘
.need [or such work is recognized unis
versally and should he encouraged
rather than discouraged. In the light
of justice and of 'value received, should
the student ‘engaged in promoting the
interests of his College be penalized
tor his loyalty?

New Year resolutions are a sad old
joke because they include nothing but
things a. man or Woman wishes to
give up. That sort of resolution gen—
erally runs into an early thaw and
fades gently away. Instead Of
solving to stop this, and quit that, and
taper off on the other, it is a great
deal better to resolve forward and not
back. Try saying to yourself: "Resolv~
