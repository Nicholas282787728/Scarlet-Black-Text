TilIS FRIENDSHIP

One of the mose significant may
ments in recent years has been the
tendency of people of like interests
to unite into a. common fraternal bond
for mutual help and protection. _ The
rise of the labor union, employer's
'ilnions, and unions of nations are ex-
amples of this growing desire of like
to unite with, like. So too there are
some idealists Who believe that there
is a similar bond between ‘studcnts the
World over and their belief is now
being put to an acid test, and at this
time t‘rl'innell is being given its chance
to cast its vote for or sgainst‘ this
great fraternal union of the seekers
for knowledge.

The students of a great nation of
the World, Russia, are at this instant
threatened with starvation} On these
men depends the future welfare of
that great nation which many predict
will play the trump hand in world af—

lairs at no distant date. Whether

Russial enters the lists of the world's=

affairs as a constructor or ‘destroyur
will largely be a matter of leader-l
ship. with the educated Russian
studcnt in power we will have little
to fear and much to anticipate when
Russia comes into her own, but. with,
the uneducated rabble at the helm ofl
the ship of state ,the world may well
tremble and prepare for rough weath-
er.

The students of American colleges,
are being given tho privilege of a‘,
vote in this momentous contest. This
vote is in the form of a. Student
Friendship Pond which will be devotr
ad to feeding starving students in
Russian universitlts. The American

. dollar is now capable of doing wond-
ers in Europe. One meal a day can
be furnished to a. Russian student for
a month for uni), the price of about
two American meals. Five dollars
would be sufficient ,to keep hunger
from the door of one of these students
ion the complete winter, and with the
cold months oncc passed they would
be again Self supporting.

Thcsc students are not Bolsheviks
or Reds. They are disciples of the
same teachcrs whom we study, and
read the same hooks which we read.
They are brothers in the great in—
ternatlunal fraternity of the seekers
after the truth. A contribution to
in Student Friendship Fund is merely
the payment, the dues which 'we owe
to this great fraternity. chcr Iowa

on cges have subscribed liberally to
this cause and it is not to be feared
that Grinne'll Will {all down on her
duty when the call is so clear and
ringing.

From an impartial point or View
it would appear that the student body
