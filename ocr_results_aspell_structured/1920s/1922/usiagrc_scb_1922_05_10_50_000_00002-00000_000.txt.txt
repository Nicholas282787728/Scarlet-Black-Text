THE SCHOL. RSI-TIP SITUATION

During the past few months there
seems to have been a general tight~
ening up in scholastic standards
the schools of the country and this
movement has been given consider-
able attention in Grinnell, Hand in
hand wrtlr the raised standards for
admittance next fall there has gone
a campaign to increase the require-
ments in connection with the var-rous
scholarsirips that are now in effect.
At the present time, in particular,
this seems to he at its height.

Briefly, the situation seems to be
this; a number of nren were granted
student aid, in the form of scholar—
ships, for the year, subject to satis—
factory scholastic Work. When some
or these toiled to rrrairrtain the neces-
sary quality or work, they were in-
formed that the funds would he with-
drawn and that tlrey would have to
meet the regular hills. This notiﬁca-
tlon was verbal and has been followed
by others in written form. Finally. in
view of the apparent indifference of
those afieeted, a time limit was set
with certain penalties if this was not
observed. ,

.On the other hand, the men so no-
tiiied felt that the scholar-ships had
been given tor a year and that they
did not need to take action, noun
ever, when second notices were re<
ceived, they took the matter up, indie
r—ldually, with men who claimed to be
able to settle matters. They were in-
tormed that all necessary steps had
been taken and that they need do

nothing. As a result, there is a. good‘

deal of antagonism aroused between
the students and the faculty.

It seems apparent that the entire
matter is one of misunderstanding
and one that can he cleared up with
little effort it the two factions are
willing to get together. it is untor»
lunate that such things should havc
been lelt in the hands of one or two
men who had not the authority to act
but the important thing now is to
reach a settlement. if other than a ﬁ-
nancial settling is necessary, the real
offender's should be dealt with.

l , __(}.—-—

‘ Rumors are floating about the com-
piis concerning the recent hazing of
en upperclassman by a Emu]; of men
who were apparently overcome by the
beauties of spring and the delights Ci
momentary ‘moonllght madness." it,
is natural, of course, that the weather
should have its effect. It is also easy
to be charitable toward youthful bu-
mor. But there is no place here for
n Wanton exhibition of the Ku Klux
Klan spirit. In the iutiire, all such

in,

 

netiritles should be left to the proper
authorities.

The intertorcnce of the fraternity in
outside acti es was hailed as tool-
islr. This article, while it says noth—
ing that brings up a new phase of the
situation, deals with a side that has
been overlooked somewhat in the gen-
eral discussion, regarding the place of
such a group in the dormitories.

The dorrrritories were hrrilt some
few years ago to providc a place for
the men of the college to live, apiacc
that they could call home and could
develop as they wished. The con-
strrrction of srrclr an arnhitious prOr
ject was undertaken because the col-
lege authorities felt that a dormitory
system would be beneﬁcial in provid-
ing good living quarters for the men
and in giving units where a limited
number could get together and devel—
oil a group spirit. They were under-
taken with the underlying thought
that they would eliminate the desire
for any fraternal organizations such
as the secret ones now in existeiicer
or rather those that functioned more
or less publicly until the present dis-
oils 'on arose. .

During the past icrv years, the dor-
mitories have pi'm‘en a success and
they have given a unity to the sine
dent body that uas formerly lacking.
However, the recently achieved liar—

recognized group, the mere fact that
organizations srrch as these in ques—
tion exist is enough to wreck any
chance tor a student body held to»

Consciously or other-u , there is
a feeling at ”superiority” in the man
who is' a member oi a sub r-osa group
that is successfully ”getting by." This
feeling is suppressed as long as the

What Do You Think?

Editor Scarlet and Black:

I feel that you are to be compli-
mented this year on having given to
Giinuell College through your Lol-
umns more unwholesome and un-
healthful advertising than any editor
in. the last ten yeztrs.

When a. college man becomes at se-
nior and is elected as Editor-in~Chio[
of a College newspaper, it is presum—
ul that, he has some discretionary

powers. This is iu,iel‘ci'cuco to thc
siiblccls you handle and permit to he
handled through your columns, whctli»
er they are apropos, whatwrllberhc
result, and whether or not they might
be treated more properly through
some other source.

some time ago you permitted
panhandling of the Scholarship Com-
mittee or the Adinistl'ation because of
its presued and hypothetical prefer—
ence touurds athletes. This rag chcw-
rrrg followed two, not altogether-
healthful, athletic seasons. 1L ac~
complishcd the only result of
grvnrg Crinrrell a blacl: eye both in—
srde and outside the school. Had you
taken your troubles to the Scholar—
ship Committee you would have prob
ably have hrt a bull's eye instead of
slinging mud all over the campus.

Noiv you are engaged in an “Anti-
rr-at and sorority“ ltgltotion. You
might be due for some credit for hav-
ing the courage or your convictions,
if you had any idea what the result
was to be on the school. If you had
considered for a moment what end
you were to acomplish, you certainly
would have adopted other means. Why
didn‘t )ou take your grievances to the
proper authorities, lay the facts he-
fore them, tell them you are the Ed-
itmuinsChief or the s. K: B. and that
YOU are supposed to represent a cer-
tain faction (you certainly are cred—
ting factions) and by so doing save
Grinneii from all your black mailing.

Suppose we adnrit tor or moment
that all the evils c. at in (turmoil
that you have pictured in your coi-
ums this ycar. Were you to drive
down to breakfast some morning from
the dorms and ﬁnd that all the ashes
or years irorn the Power plant had
been dumped on Park street right in
lront oi the Chapel, would you drive
right into the center of the pile just
because they were there? Would you
have Prexy dismiss Chapel to come
out and see what you had done? No,
you would probably drive around the
ashes some way and ttihe the matter
LID D the Dl'ODel' manner,

You have my per-mission to publish
this letter in what you term your
“What Do You Think” column, 317

Should you publish this, hindiy sign
my name as 1 do not wish to be clas-
sed with your hiackauailers, i. e. 1'

in conclusion, would ask, what are
