He believes that our educational sys.
tem stresses hook loarning too much
and character building too little.
There are two requisites tor the in-
troduction of such a standard: a dc-
sire among the people for a new stand-
ard and some means of measuring
righteousness. The speaker conclud-
ed by or ting the general trend or
the hook in asserting that consciously
