“JUST MARRIED" IS COlLEnr ‘
SCREAM AT COLONIAL “’ED.’

Following sixty-ﬁve weeks at the
Nora Bayes Theatre in New York, and
a six months run at the La Salle
theatre in Chicago, ”Just Married,"
that famous laughing success will be
presented at the Colonial Wednesday,
November 29.

"Just Married" is a rip-roaring
‘comedy splash. The authors are
Adelaide Matthews and Anna Nichols,
who gave thc stage such a big suc-
cess as "Scrambled Wivés" and
"Nightie Night." ”Just Marl-led has
a plot abounding with complications
that are said to be extremenly arouse
ing. There is a per-netnal flow of
clever lines. The story centers about
a gently stimulated young man who

she sails fsom Bordeaux, Frnnce, fol"

Women students at the University
at Iowa are now working under a
point system which regulates the
number or outside activities they mzty
engage in. Each office of a campus
organization carries so many points,
which constitutes the remrler points

parts in plays, or work in ofticcs
which do not last for a whole semesel

, Choice of a Career

From the Yale News

THE NiNETY-FOUR

Someone, probably an insurance
agent, was quoted recently as saying
that from the mass of one hundred
College graduates one individual only
rose to the Polo and butler class, peril-
ously near the top of the ﬁnancial lad-
der. Five others became comfortably
off and found themselves after twenty
years at the small yacht and chauffeur
stage. The other nlncly—foul’ presum—
ably congregate in the great section of
the American people who drive their
own Buick: to the golf club. In other
words, dreaming about being a rich
man is one thing, and making the grade
is ”something else again.”

Yet the ninety-four prcsumablywork
justros hard asthe sumptuous six. Their
buslncss is the axis on which a small
and uninteresting world revolves. They
have become devotees of the dollar
and when that ﬁckle deity deserts, have
nowhere else to turn, Jammed in a
dull, straight rut of business they can
never leave the road and jump the fence
info finer ﬁelds of life. This, then, is
the portion of ninety-four men out of
every hundred now on the campus.

The answer to the problem lies in
the proper choice of a career.

 

 

Between now and Commencement
we shall have something to Offer on
the subject of “Careers.” Watch for
the space with the Famous Signature.

proved that natural and artiﬁcial

carbonates of copper are always
constant in composition.

“There must be some law in
this,” reasoned Dalton (1766—
1844), the Quaker mathematician
and‘school teacher. That law he
proceeded to discover by weighing
and measuring. He found that each
element has a combining weight
of its own. To explain this, he
evolved his atomic theory—the
atoms of each element are all
alike In size and Weight; hence
a combination can occur only in
deﬁnite proportions.

Dalton’s theory was published
in 1808. In that same year, Na.

General

poleon made his brother, Joseph,
king ofSpain. This was considered
a political event of tremendous
importance. But Joseph left no
lasting impression, while Dalton,
by his discovery, elevated chem-
istry from a mass of unclassiﬁed
observations and recipes into a
science.

Modern scientists have gone be-
yond Dalton. They have found
the atom to be composed of elec-
trons, minute electrical particles.
in the Research Laboratories of
the General Electric Company
much has been done to make this
theory practically applicable so
that chemists can actually-predict
the physical, chemical and elec-

‘ trical properties of compounds yet.

in a world of ﬂeeting events
the spirit of science and research
endures.
