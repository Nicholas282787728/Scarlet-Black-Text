THANKSGIVING. l

VTolncrrou‘ the people of the United
States will observe Thanksgiving Day.
The President of the country has tie»
dared it a legitl holiday, to be set
aside for the purpose 0! giving thanks
to God for the blessings that He has
bestowed upon us during the past year.

Many students from Grinnell Will go
to their homes to eat Thanksgiving
dinner. The turkey dinner is a. trar
(lition in many American homes.
Thanksgiving and Christmas 'are the
traditional times for a. general family
gathering around the table, and rela—
tives collie from near and far to feast
together. It has been ever thus since
the Pilgrim Fathers cclebrated that
ﬁrst Thanksgiving. -
» \Vhy do we do it and What is the
signiﬁcance of the day? It is a day
set aside by a. nation that is thankful
to its God for “Life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness," and the reali-
zation of these ideals during the past
year. And how rich have been the
blessings of the American people dur-
ing that year! We have not been
troubled with revolutions, the starva-
tion of our people, national ﬁnancial

giving thanks:l Does our obligation

which we should ask ourselves and

should be in the negative.

It is for us to carry on the work
which will result in the continuation

Americans should also realize that
