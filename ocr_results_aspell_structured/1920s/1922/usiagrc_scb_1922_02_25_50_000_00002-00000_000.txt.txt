DON’T LIE DOWN

"We may be dead but we don’t lie
dowuLhiotto, The Dead Man's Club,
whose membership consists of all
those fellows reported officially dead
during the war.

Every so oiten it becomes neces—
slhx'y to recall the past. and to drug
from their resting 'places the tradi-
ﬁlms of Grinnell in order that we may
view them and then revise our own

ways of living accordingly. it usu-
ally chances that a brie! summary is
sufficient to recall the
spirit of the present, altho occasion-

wandering

ally a continued campaign is neces—
sary, due to the lack of appreciation
or the true value of Gl'lnnell’s tra<
ditions and of the place that they play
in our current campus life.

The charges that may be preferred
against the presem. student body are
brieﬂy these: failure to support the

' chapel and vesper services; non-obs
servance of the traditions regarding
the ranking of classes; non-comforlll~
ity to the several rulings regarding
qulel‘. hours at the dormitories and
study hours .at the quadrangle; and
ﬁnally 8. general low standard of
conduct and a lack of the proper more
ale.

Admittedly, these charges are the
result of looking at campus affairs
thru a pair of dark colored glasses
hut A brief consideration of the prob-
lems as they appear in our everyday
life here will bear out the conclu—
slons. And until there is a. change
in Conditions we will be found lacking
in certain qualities vital to the best
interests of the college and hopes of
ourselves.

We pride ourselves on our sell gov—
ernment and the chief reason for dis—
obedience of the. rules established
seems to be the feeling that we
are independent beings and as such
beyond the reach of disciplinary meals»
ures. However, what so many of us
do not understand is that conformity
to the established order of things is
the only way in which freedom can
be obtained, Contrary to our own
judgments of ourselves, the majority
of students here strut around the
campus for tour years. make their
brief bow at graduation time, and are
gone. Unlike the members of the
Dead Man's Club, they are not only
dead. but they Will lie down forever.

In the iuture, we will not be, known
as individuals but as a member oi a
class. Without cooperative action the
class can do nothing and without ac.
tion of the right sort Lhe class will
mean nothing to the college. The
best Way, the only “my in which we
can really be of service and play an
active and constructive putt in cam-
pus affairs is to work together loi-
those traditions that have made Grins
uell what it is—tliat will contiunc to
make Gl'innell distinctive among col—

leges and Gl‘innellians distinctive

among men.

[N A MIRROR
Robert Burns once made the plea.
that we might have (he giftpf seeing
ourselves as others see us. Perhaps,

 

if the power were given us, we would
be less anxious for it and yet the null—
lty to gaze on one's self thru the eyes of
another would undoubtedly do much
toward modifying our actions and to—
ward a general readjustment
ourselves.

Each of us has something of n dual
personality. one side that each oi us
secs of himself and onc side that the
other leilow, the chance acquaintance,
sees. The first might be likened to
looking into your own mirror, after a
careful grooming or your person, and
null ing the purposely careless part
in your hair, the accurately ndjuleIl
scari, tho immaculate shoes and the
gunercl air of well being and or ex-
qllisituness. The latter is comparable
with the view of yourscli that you Mr
ceive when hurrying by a shop with
dow; dirty, unkempt, slovenly,witlial
an unattractive ﬁgure.

it a compromise between these two
views were possible the result would
undoubtedly he the real personality,
the true character of each individual.
Thedilficulty, or course, in achiev—
ing such a compromise and in reach-
ing a correct opinion lies in the fact
that none of us are willing to submit
to unrestralnted criticism, regardless
or its source. The desire to defend
our own views, our own peculiarities,
and to justify them is too ingrained
to permit or such an action. \Ve must
therefore revert to some other means,
discover some new method, whereby
we may reach the goal and at the same
time preserve ourselves from any
methods that may have an adverse
reaction.

The only apparent way to offset
one's own peculiarities and to knock
the rough edges off each individual
seems to be thru association with
others and thru general education.
No man is independent and self suffi-
cient, He'rnust depend on his follows
for cooperative action if he is to
achieve. He is bound by certain lun~
damental principles that must be ob»
served beiorc he can hope lor recogni—
tion. To discover these principles and
to be governed by thorn is the pri-
mary object of a college education and
when we do unauver them, then will

us all the characteristics that would
he brought out in a mirror, it never
‘theless serves much the same purpose
by bringing each one in contact with
other people oi the same type, people
thinking‘and doing the same things
at the same time. This cunnot fall
to have its effect, and, in a way,
shows the thing suggested by James
Harvey Robinson in his book on “The
Mind In The Making" when he says,
“If some magical transformation
could he produced in men’s ways oi
looking at themselves and their fol-
lows, uo inconsiderablc part of the
evils which now afflict society would
vanish away ‘or remedy themselves
automatically." 1i we can ﬁnd our
compromise, we may be able to ﬁnd
this greater power that is so necessary
to ourselves and to the world at large.

Editor of the Scarlet and Black:
From time to time there appear in
these columns communications rela.
tive to going to chapel. Since, at the
proseul'timc, the chapel speakers ad—
dress scarcely more than the empty
scale some action becomes necessary.
Whenever we discuss the subject of
chapel attendance the question is ills

as well as the faculty, go in Chapel?

are those who are constantly hungry
and must be fed. The establishment
if a cafeteria might eliminate this diffi—
culty. Fromtbcsoreasonsnnd others
of equal value we ﬁnd that the entire
system is wrong and must he chang—
ed to meet the needs as they exist,

But when we come down to solid
ground there is not one but who will
admit that there is a real value in the
chapel system. The large vote on
the part of the students some two
years ago to retain the present sys—
tem is adequate proof of this. The
constant advice oi alumni to go to
chapel can not be overlooked, it is
not what we get each morning that
counts but what we get over a per-
iod of time that really amounts to n
great deal. Also the chapel is a vital
part of Grinnell, We can not imagine
Grinnell without her chapel: Be»
cause or these things the students
should take the responsibility of go-
ing to chapel more seriously and sea-
lize that their constant attendance is
necessary for the preservation of this
institution which we all pride so high—

it would seem in some cases the
speakers had been notiﬁed they were
going to speak, when they came into
the building. The whole point is sim-
ply this. If the speakers are notiﬁed
ahead of time and if they are going to

why not tell the students about ii. so

Editor Scarlet and Black:

As it nonralhiete, my sympathies
were stirred by the awful depivlvity
revealed in your columns thru the an—
onymous Sophomore. I have a, solu~
tion to offer.

Organ"e intercollegiate teams and
compet ion for those who have talent
(if not genius.)

Then unusually strict rules of eilr
glbility could be devised especially for
them, just as there are now for ath—
isles. Directors could be appointed to
supervise, look after deﬁciencies and
conditions and encourage good class
room work.

It may he replied that we already
have intercollegiate debating, but. that
could scarcely serve our purpose, be»
cause debating requires a degree of in;
tcllcctual training and application
which is not to be thought of in con-
nection with the genius.

What vwe need is activities which
come naturally, so that the untrain—
meled spirit of each of us may ﬁnd
intercollegiate expression in free
speech, free verse, and tree what not.

A few practical suggestions for in.
tercollegiate teams would be; Val-r
sity Versihcstlon, with coach, scan-
ners, etc, who could inform members
when they were conditioned or out of
form. Society souad, which might
have the following divisions:

Izounge Lizards. Pill Pullers, Danc—
ers and Card sharks.

so draw keen varsity competition, A

it's no worse a job here than in the

school is not necessarily one in col--
lege. One way would be to do as your
contributor, the sophomore, did when
he classi ed as athletes all those he
wanted in that group for the purpose
of his argument.

But 1 have a simple way. instead

collegiate athletes, I propose that in
this new ﬁeld which is to be «lamina:

seen forces of genius. we adopt a new
method at selection. Let each one de<
clare himself. Let those who have
genius ill not talent) frankly admit
it.

To be sure, men who are destined
to display genius in later life, rarely
distinguish themselves ironu their iel—
lows in college days. But We can get
around that by asking those who feel
as though they are apt to develop
genius, if not talent, to step forward.

And what would be the result?

These rightfully sell centered indi—
viduals would have the same honors
and assistance from the college group
as members of athletic and debuting
teams, dramatic and gigs clubs now
have. A man's value to the society

From A Faint Blue Glow
To Modern Miracles

DISON saw it ﬁrst—a mere shadow of blue light streaking across tile
terminals insicle an imperfect: electric lamp. Tl’llS “leak" of elec-
tric current, an obstacle to lamp perfectionwas soon banished by
removing more air from the bulbs.

But the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance in a_ high

vacuum

remained unexplained for years.

Then 1. J. Thomson established the electron theory on the trans-
mission of electricity in a partial vacuum—and the blue light was

understood.

In a very high vacuum, however, the light: and appar-

ently the currents that caused it disappeared.

One clay, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company proved that a current could be made to pass
through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to

ﬁxed laws.

But the phantom light had vanished.

Here was a new and deﬁnite phenomenon—m basis for further re-

search.

lmmediately, scientists began a series of experiments with far reach—
ing practical results. A new type of X—ray tube, known as the Coolidge
tube, soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron
