YOUR liEer EFFORT
The members oi the Rotary Club

have recently published broadcast a

poster which reads: ”put your best et-

tort into everything you do today."

These words have been published in

conspicuous positions, both in the

newsnapers and on signboai-ds, and
have attracted a great deal at atten-
tion. They are one phase or the work
being carried on by the national R0-
tal'y, Club organization in its efforts
to improve the "moralev ot the coun-
try, ud incidentally oi the world.
As 3 result of the tremendous stress
laid upon it in war times, we became
very familiar with this term~"mor<
- ale"—and soon came to lean heavily
on it to explain any possible contin-
gently that might arise. Everyone da-
voted himself to this and when the
strain at war was over, the same vol»
unteel- doctors let it drop with {L great
thud. This shattering oi international
"morals" was the basis tor present
conditions, according to numerous
eminent authorities and hence the le-
storative treatment.

Whatever the cause. the sentiment
of the poster need not he reserved
for one speciiic held, alone, but may
he adopted generally. it has just as
Vital 8 meaning for the college stu—
dent as it has for the business man.
and is just as true in Russia as it is
in America. There can be no doubt
that if everyone puts his best eitort
into everything done today, and if he

does everything today that needs atr‘

(enlion, here will he a vast improve-
men 11] conditions everywhere.

DUSTING THE VACANT Mum

Th New York Insitnle [or Public!

Service has been conducting an i -

vestigation regarding the general iii-i

formation on current events held by
the ordinary student. To accomplish
this, successive questionnaires have

been sent out to the different classes‘

and efforts have been made to classi-

fy the results with 3. view to propos-l

ed educational reiornis which shall
involve the linking up or current
events with the theoretical work her
ing carried on in the schools.

In the main, the questionnaires were
sent to high school teachers and trom
the returns sent in, the general av
erage ot twenty thousand students
was only fatty-one per cent right.

This seems to lie it Very discouragingl

condition, altlm the results ﬂuctuated
widely and the personal element must
play a large part in the understand
ing and knowledge ot the students.
However, similar investigations have
been carried on in colleges at the
country and the results have been
equally painlul. lilany college classes
show less knowledge or current his
tory than do their high school or their
eight grade contemporaries. in every
case, however, the protessor seems to
play a vital part in the thoroughness
o: the work and the amount of such
intormation acquired.

The renewed, agitation tor a work—
ing knowledge ot current events is
perhaps~ one at the most signiﬁcant
of the time. it is the result oi an up.

Phoenix Silk and Wool Hose i

preciotlon oi the need lor present day
knowledge and oi the demand tor a
less theoretical and more practical
course tor the college man. Naturally,
a knowledge or the daily news
not secure this but it will pave the
way tor a hroadEr development and
will give a grcater range or interestsi
than would otherwise he possible.
The work ‘oi the institute fur Pub-

the objections that haie been advanc-
utl with regard to modern educational
methods and is an attempt to combat

Editor Scarlet and Black:

in your paper or Feb. 11th I have
Just read the communication or the
"Grinch Grad" in which he starts
out with his "0 Hell!" gush.‘ And
tollowing his remarks I note also what
‘is said by the one who signs himr
sell, “A Gl'iuuell Alumnus." The
Sophomore, who has also had his
turn, gets rather rough treatment at
the hands of the "Grinneli Alumnus."

Perhaps the Sophomore did over-
state some things in his communicae
tion as Sophomoies are apt to do. But
it is nonsense to say, or even to imply
that he did not have a reason ior his
contentions. Of course, athletics must
. he recognized as worth while at (him
null, and our sophomore friend will
doubtless be ready to grant it. Howe
ever, when he gets the idea that
'Gi'lilllell is bending over backwards
' toward the student who is especially
interested in, and ﬁtted ior, athletics,
he is not dreaming all the time, at
least. A Graduate of Grinneil, work-
ing in the interest or the college, 02117

To use his words, he was "out lookr

ing prospective students in my town
‘ He had heard oi two or three boys
who had made a. good showing in
high school athletics. He omitted no
item in regard to these prospects and
asked if there were others like them.
' I knew of no others. Though I
did name other good prospects who
were young neople or very high rank,
though not nilllctes. But be ignored

as take tlle llamas of these people
whom I named. 'In fact, before he
left, lie stated that he wanted men
who could play football. It was this

man's business to “look up students

- it, Maybe our Sophomore friend had
had a visit from some one “looking
up students for Grinnell" and was
experience in that

genuine contribution to a healthy

ly. and what I saw while there leads

me to question whether a healthy

Grinnell‘ Sp it can exist without far
\‘oralile changes. I question it it is
passilﬂe for it real Grinncll Spirit to
prosper where men live ln the ﬁlth,
created by themselves, such (l5 was to
be found there two weeks ago. More,
it was a special occasion that Grin-
nell was observing. A, series or lcc—

pie, Dr. Carl Patton might about as
well have gone up to Newhurg mid

exceptions, comparatively, the stil-
dents were not there at those morn
ing chapel services and lectures, and
(his is equally as true with the lace,
ulty. i was there and saw.

I am a graduate of Grinuell and i
too, am proud of it. And I believe in\
Grinnell. But Grillnell, with both
mind and heart, can well nttord to
think many times about the thoughts
and attitude ot the Sophomore who
very ironkly expressed iiiniselt in the
