MORE ABOUT PEP ’

if anyone in Grinnell has ever been
skeptical about the effect of a gen.
erous display of pep on a football
team the witnessing of the contest on
Ward held last Saturday should have
dispelled all doubt. That game show-
ed just what a well coached team can
do when they know that the whole

' _school is baching’them and depending
on them to do their very best.

The team knew that we were all
back or theni for such enthusiasm as
was slrol’vn at the pep meeting on
Friday night and in the grandstand
Saturday afternoon can arise from
nothing but a wlrole-souled interest in
the team. It is such pep which makes
a team‘want to ﬁght The so-called
pep we ﬁnd so otten at football
games—the halHleal'ted. kind which
is forced just because the yell leader
says to yell will never put light in a
team. The kind we had Saturday—the
kind which cannot be held in and

shows that the crowd is with the,

team every minute regardless or the
yell leader is the kind that wins.
The team gives to their opponents
just what we give them If our en-
thusiasm is or the hallshearted, I’m
yellingheeause-l-haveto type the team
in nine cases out of ten will put up
just such a ﬁght. If our yelling is
or the let-me-yellsoisI'Il-bust type we
can bank on the team ﬁghting to the
last minute with every bit or energy
they have.

As was said in beginning the game
on Saturday proved that this theory
is not all bunk. The crowd was
fairly bursting with enthusiasm, and
men who have watched ,Gi-innell
teams for years say that it has been
years since they have seen/ a Grin-
nell team light as this one did on
Saturday, It was a marvelous ex.
hihition. True, the large end or the
score went to Arires through a .Whim-
sicality of old Man Luck; but, as one
alumnus has said, "Everyone knows
that we really won in spite of what
the scoreboard Says." And he is right,
So lets keep on lighting with this
winning team until the last whistle
blows just as we did on Saturday.

A WORD 0N FENCES

About a week ago there appear-ed in

this column ml article dealing with

the beauties of the Grillncll College
campus. Almost simultaneously with
the appearance or this article there
also appeared a new addition to the
equipment of the college in the form.
of a very substantial iron fence or
railing similar to those found on har-
bershop stairwnys. The purpose of
this new piece oi campus iur-iriture is
obviously tomake possible the elllr
tivation of a grass plot in front of

the library by preventing people from

WhBUJel‘ there is ituy connection be»

fence we ivo nob know. In any event

a real pride in having a beautiful
campus. They are Still in the primary
grade and have to be disciplined to
induce them to lnake this slight 2f-
tort to keep the campus as beautiful
as possible.

Let’s try and grow’ up between now
and Spring before any more of these
eye—sores are placed on the campus.
