The Quadrangle this week is I'celiinL'A
with mystery, but the most pcrsistaul
reporter ﬁnds himself against a blank
stone wall. No one but the sopho—
more girls know, what's going to hap-
pen—and they're not tellingl While
the rest of the college gapes and won-

Aat all hours of the day and night, and

dark errands.

The primary cause of all this hllbr
hub and excitement is generally Corr
coded to he the fact that at four
thirty Friday afternoon the ladies of
the Sophomore class are staging a big
party in the Little Tlledteiwd party
which all the girls in the college areI
urgently invited to attend, This isI
'the ﬁrst of a series of girls' all»cullege I
parties which the lntciSociety Coun-
cil is planning to give throughout the
year.

at the moment of going to press those
in charge firmly refuse to state the
nature of the program, A bewilderw

that more than thirty girls will take

stcnographers and stage hands; and
in the face of such an imposing array
of talentisophomol'e talent at that—
we al'e.compelled to admit that the,
affair promises to he one of the big-
