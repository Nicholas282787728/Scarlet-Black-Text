Tonight’s Game Hardest On List
For Best of Season—Kansas
In Second Place.

Everything is ready and the stage
is set for the Pioneer‘Jayhawker
clash in the Men's Gym tonight. Fol--
lowing the Cornell engagement last
Saturday the Grinnell cugel'nen have
been put through drilling in on at-
tempt to put more power into The Pi-A
oneer attack. Especial attention has
been given to play of the ball after it
is carried under the basket, a depart-
ment in the game which has not been
emphasized in previous games. ‘

Coach Saunders expressed his unr
certainty as to the men whom he will
start in tonight's game, but he hinted
that a surprise might be in store when
the line~up is announced and said that
ihe was quite sure that the starters
”against Kansas would be different
than in any other game so far this
season.

 

.
Jausscn May Be but

it is doubtful if Janssen,/Grinnell's
busily guard, will he in condition to
play because of trouble which he is
having with his eyes, Aside from that,
it is not expected that there will be
any other men who will not be in
shape to work in the Kansasgameu
Edwards, a sophomore candidate for,
cage honors, has improved immensely;
of late and stands a chance of being
used on the regulars if he continues
his improvement

Tonight’s game will probably be the
hardest test to which the Pioneers will
be put during the remainder of the
season. Kansas at present stands
next'bo Missouri in the lliissonri Val-
ley conference standing and has prov—‘
ed itself to be one of the best teams
in this section of the countiy. Their
lineup includes such famous names
as Rudy, Jayhawk captain, and Endlr
soft, the big Kansas guard.

Grinnell so far this season has
seemed to have a mortgage on last
place which she has been unwilling
to relinquish but present opinon un
the campus is that We should not he
too selfish and should let some other
school such as Washington, which has
been running the Scarlet and Black
a close second, have a chance at the
coveted cellar position. Local follow—
ers of the sport claim that tonight is
the ordained time for the Pioneers to
hit their stride and begin their climb
up the standing column,

It is expected that a large crowd,
will be in attendance in order to cheer
the Pioneers on for a ﬂying finish dur-
ing the remainder of the season.

Ames, 1a., Feb. 15,7(Special)—,
Kansas university turned a. sluw bas—

afternoon, when Coach Allen thought1
he had a safe lead and called out three
of his ﬁrst string men for a rest, and

W'hlle both teams displayed strong‘

Captain Rody for the university ﬁve

Currie led in the scoring, although eve

The steady march of the Kansans
up the ﬂoor for bushels was met by
an coually efficient short pass game
by chandler's team. The inability of
the Cyclones to hit the loop unless
close up made the difference. The,
strength of the Kansas offense rested
in accurate passing, a driving play,

Prof. D. 1“. Grass Is Author of
Material Appearing In “The
Northwestern Banker,"

The February issue of the North-
western Banker. a ﬁnancial magazine
published at Des Molues and edited by
Donald H. CT ~k, ’18, contains an ar—
ticle, "How Grinnell College Trains
Future Bankers and Business Men,"
by Professor D. F. Grass. The article
is the eighth in a series on the gen-
eral subject, “How the Modern Unl-
verelty Trains Future Bankers and
Business Men.“ The article is ac-
companied by several cuts of the Cam»
pus and buildings.

The particular opportunities offer-
ed at Grinnell, the courses of study in
the department of Business Adminis—
tration, and the aim of the department
are all well described by Professor
Gross. To quote from him:

“The ﬁrst year at Grinnell in the
Business Administration work calls
for the economic organization of so-
ciety, at economic principles and prob»
lems, together with elective studies in
English, mathematics, modern lan-
guage, history or science. The seer
ond year is taken up with a study of
accounting principles and practice,
money and credit, and corporation
ﬁnance, with electives as in the first
year. The third year work is a course
in business organization and inauager
ment, and business law with electives.
The 4th year is composed of elective
work in practical banking, insurance,
salesmanship, advertising, secretarial
transportation, theory of
ﬁnance, and statistics.

“The aim throughout is to prepare
the graduate to enter the business
world equipped and ready to take up
his first year or two of business life
as practical post-graduate study with
a view to mastering his special busi-
ness ﬁeld and climbing to the top."

so Philip Gibbs, writing from the
Middle West, which he recently visited
for the first time, on the strong Sentlr

'method has been tried in other schools
and has been very satisfactoiy from
every standpoint. The Debating Union
is responsible for the trial here and if
it proves successful it may be adopted

The great advantage in this type of
debate is that the contestants do more
than strive for a decision, and this
eliminates from the discussion some
material which is useful only in bias-

T Following the debate proper, the
audience is to be given a chance
