“Saturday evening the Cornhusbers
are scheduled to take on the Grinnell
ave at the coliseum. Grinnell has lost
games to Oklahoma, Kansas and Kan-
sas Aggies and the dope points to a
Husker victory. Let the fact that
Kansas defeated Grinnel does not inc

Foreign Studenf/s Show Great In-
terest in Armament Debates
In Eastern University.

Cambridge, Mass, Jan. lat—inter-
cst here in the \liashnrgton conference
received an impetus a month ago
which is so sustained in its effects
that at this late date it worth discusV
sing.

On November 5t SIX Harvard slur
dents, nationals o France, England.
Japan, China, Italy and the United
states met to discuss the following
resolution, before an audience oi 350
students; “Resolved; That to prevent
the next war it is necessary that
there be universal recognition of the
Open Door Policy; that there be an
immediate and complete naval holi-
day; that there be a progressive re»
duction of all armaments; that there
be free admission of Germany and
Russia to the iamily of nations; and
that there be an association of all
nations to establish and maintain jus-
tice." The meeting was under the one
pices of the Harvard student Lio-
eral club; Lieutenant-Governor Alvan
T. Fulled oi Massachusetts president.

Seated about a conference table
similar to the one at Washington. the
six aforementioned students seriously
considered the problems over which
the diplofats in Washington are work-
ing. Three hundred and fifty other
students listened attentively and tens-
ly to their arguments as each present.
ed the case for his country. By the
time the oil-incl speeches were over
and the discussion thrown open to the
door, the interest and enthusiam riv—
alled that of a football mass meeting.
Men jumped to their feet calling for
the door; many spoke simultaneously:
each clause of the resolution was hot—
ly contested; and after three hours of
fierce debate it was the sense of the
meeting that there should be universal
recognition of‘ the Open Door Policy
in China, an immediate and complete
naval holiday, progressive reductign of
all armaments, and an association of
nations; itwas voted that Germany be
invited to join the conference bith in
Harvard and in Washington, but that
Russia remain outside the pale until
she had proven her government re,

spdnslble.
