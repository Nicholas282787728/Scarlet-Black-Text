WE AREN'T EEVOLTING

A college could not live long Wilh—
out its students The college exists
for those men and women who arel
taking advantage of the opportunities
offered them by an institution or hlgne l
er learning. When a large part ol
the membership of the college family
thinks that something is wrong with
the system which governs them it
would seem that the system ought to
be changed-

In "order to give the faculty of Grin-
nell college deﬁnite evidence of Stu»
dentlopmlon on the absence role both
the student council and the Lantern
have petitioned the curriculum com-
mlttee to change and modil-y the rui-
lng. These are perhaps the two most
representative bodies on the campus,
and it is reasonable to assume that
they rellect the’ feelings of a large
part of the student body.

It is well to bear in mind that tha'
student body is not, as yet, in a state
of revolt and is not making any de-
mands of those who have the power
to links or change the rules. The
student body merely believes that the
rule is unjust, and that, in the inter-
est o: harmony and cooperation 11-
mong' students and faculty, it should
be changed. The two organizations
mentioned above have respectfully pe-
titioned the curriculum committee to
consider changes in the ruling, and if
such is done all will be well again.

A certain professor in this institu-
tion has said that nothing is certain
in this World except change. That is‘
or sholull‘l be true of all laws and 1eg—1
islatton. The absence rule was merely
an experiment, We believe that the
experiment has failed in that it has
not won the support of the students,
and we believe that most college stu—
dents are on the whole generous and
fair minded: The present sentiment
against the rule is icstered by a. ae—l
sire on the part or the students for
harmony and good reeling in the col—
lege family. \

that it 1s possible that the foulin'g was
not entirely one sided. in the heat
at the game it is very easy zor any1
man to foul an opponent intentional-

ly on account of a grudge because or
previous fouling by the opponent, es-
pecially if bagged o1’- encouraged by
the crowd.

That brings us to the point of all
this. The Grinnell routers have it in
their power to prevent most or the“
fouling on the part of both teams ll"
they will discourage rather than em.

plaint about the attitude of the men on l
the side lines, especially in one or two
or the games. Dirty Work, it encourag—
ed by the onlookers, is just as much
their fault as it is the iault of the
team. it crinnell lnus will refrain
from cheering a foul on the part of al
Grinnell man, and it, when an oppo»
nent fouls, they will keep quiet l‘dlhr
er than hiss him and make him all me

long way towards helping the lPione
cars to win the reputation of being the
cleanest team in the Missouri Valle!
Conference.

No ﬁner tribute can be paid any col-
lege than to be able to say that its
athletes are clean ﬁghters. it ls up
to the onloolr'era to help the Pioneers

is generally conceded that the present
ruling in regard to unexcused.absen-

absences are generally excused. in
regard to excused absences there are
ﬁrst the clear cases of necessity: long

ruling should be extended to allow
plenty of room lu1 these activities in‘
any one organization but there should‘
be a limit set to check. too great par-
ticipation in outside activities and to‘,

discussions which are, of necessity,
lost by absence even if the work is
made up. Secondly there one abscnc
