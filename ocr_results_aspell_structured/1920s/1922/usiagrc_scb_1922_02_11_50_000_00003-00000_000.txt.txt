PROBLEMS CONCERNING GENOA
CONFERENCE LOOM UP. ‘
Despite the intimation of France
that she might not send delegates to
the Genoa economic and ﬁnancial con-
ference, if the nations seem to menace
her interests or threaten her rlghm,
—Lloyd George has declared that the
conference Would not be Postponed but
Would he held on March 8. Rumors
have it, however, that the United States
is opposed to such an early meeting
and will ask {or a postponemmenr
until some time in June in order to
sound out public opinion and give the
senate a chance to act on the new
treaties recently formulated.

HARDING SUBMI’I‘S FACTS r0 Sl-IN-

President Harding has in person
submitted to the senate the pacts ior-
mulated at the peace conference and
has urged their ratiﬁcation. In a
speech to the senators, he clearly stat—
ed his DDslllon, took recognition of the
Senate’s prerogatives, and then chal—
lenged all opposition to the treaties
submitted. Immediate action is expec—
ted, since majority and minority lead—
ers are convinced that the position or
the irreconcilablee is so undermined
that they cannot accept the challenge

TRUTH IS TOPIC
OF NORRIS TALK

,Professor Makes Plea For Stand

Against Known Wrong.

"Be gonrl and be alone,” were the
opening words of Prof, Norris iii chap-
el Monday morning when he spoke
on “Truth." Truth nlten stands alone
without a. champion. he asserted and

in years gone past the great martyrs]

have stood alone or with a very small
minority.

The Speaker declared that a. man
Who Waits to cast his vote with mar

. jorlty is nothing but a. "camp follow-

er,” but that the real man is he who
ﬁghts against the majorities until hls
pi-lnclples’win out and his minorityy
changes to a majority.

It Lakes is real man to stand up for
what he thinks. and especially in col—
le ego is it hard to go against the ma—
SO rlties. However there is a.
chance tarday (or a college man to be
one of the minority and light for what
Dishonest acting
and dishonest thinking, unwemanly
snohblshness, unwhuleseme traditions,
and cheating exist in colleges and the
question is ”Why not smash it?" ”Dare
We stand alone in protest against that
which We know is wrong?" was the

'ﬁnal challenge issued by the speaker.
