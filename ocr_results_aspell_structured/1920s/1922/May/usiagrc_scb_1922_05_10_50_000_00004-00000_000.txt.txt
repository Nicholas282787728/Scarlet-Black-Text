PLAY WEEBEFUL

Good Acting and New Stage Set—
/ ting Features of “Strictly
Conﬁdential” Friday.

Good presentation together with an
attractive new stage setting made
possible the success of "strictly Cone
ﬁdential," produced by the Culncago-
thia and Institute societies on May 5
at the Colonial theater. The play
phich was under the direction omef.
W. H. Bridge was carried so coni—
pctently hy the cast that any Cl'itl-
clsm seems due to the play itself
rather than to any prominent weak-
nesses in acting or staging. The plot
presented a problem, then seemed to
leave the audience with an unsatisﬁed

desire for a convincing conclusion.

The one heavy part in the play was
taken by Sarah Stevenson in away
which caused much favorable com-
ment, The interprrtalion of the part
or an err-actress who found herself
married to an English Lord was not
an easy undertaking but it was ac-
complished with grace and skill. A
great deal or the success or the pro—
duction was undoubtedly due to the
splendid manner in which this part
was carried. The character of Lord
Bancroft while not quite so striking
in itseli was portrayed unusuaiy ca-
publy by James Findley. With his
\cl'y evident case on the stage the
part was interpreted in a way which
deserves much credit.

The character or the Misses Wcth-
crcll, two sweet old ladies were tak-
en by Harriet Wad. tit and Kathe
ryn Ausland who from the ﬁrst won
the sympathy or the audience Some
excellent pieces of character acting
were done by Jac Gray in the part or
Eartin Bennet and Burdette Plutts as
Dr. Preemantle. stanley Talbott as
Ernest Bonnet occasioned several of
the laughs or the evening. Charlotte
Whitehill, Gould Lowry, and Greta
Weitz. as other members of the Ben-
net family did good work as support»
ing characters Homer Abeglan, by
not entirely rising to several oppor—
lunities for good pieces of acting in
the part or George P. Newton, the
manager, allowed his part to become
a tritlo monotonous but it was other-
wise well interoreted. Mcinhcrs or
“Our Emnire" were Ruth eetcholl,
Amy Williams, Freda Schnell, Eloise
Loomls, Isabelle Lemmon, Louise
Pinkerton, Wilma. Thompson, Frances

McDowell, and Lorene Behrens.
