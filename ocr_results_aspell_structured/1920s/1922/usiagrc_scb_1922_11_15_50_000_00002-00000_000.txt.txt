The criticisms seem to be entirely on
posite.

The ﬁrst and perhaps the most hit-
ter criticisms have come from alumni
for calling the Ames touchdown a;
fluke. This is not to he an attempt to}
prove that this particular touchdown
was a fluke or not, but the criticism
comes from men who did not see the‘
game. The reporter from the Scarlet]
and Black saw the game and forth-l
with called the touchdown a fluke.
This statement concerning the touch-
flown by a fluke was repeated in a
later issue of the paper doping the
Washington game,
concerning this statement:

The Scarlet and Black has not been
conscious'of whining over the defeats
administered to the athletic teams, but
has made an honest attempt to report
the games as they actually toolr place.

But here is where the second criti—
cism comes in. Several students have
been heard to complain over the fact
that no alihis were offered for the
defeat hy Cornell. The Scarlet and
