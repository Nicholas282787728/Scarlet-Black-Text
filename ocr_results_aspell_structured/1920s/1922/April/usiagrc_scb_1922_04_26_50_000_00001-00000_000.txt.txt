t Classic Saturday

 

A unique icatnie of (he ironic meet
Saturday was the preliminary combi-
‘uation track meet and entertainment.
The Quadrangle had previously plan-
ned not to he out-shone by any Grine
nell stars and accordingly a conglom—
erate procession of women assembled
on Ward Field. Women in gym cos—
tumes, middies and bloomers; women
dressed as tho they were goingsome
place; women who looked as tho they
had been there:

The preparations being completed
and the crowd asemblod, a picked
corps of Seniors rcgaled the bleach
(era with a song, after which a large
wobly thing on wheels was dragged in
by the original athletic girls them—
iselves! The wobbly thing, upon clos—
_er obscrvation, proved to be a huge
‘silver cup that the victorious Soph
basket ball team should have received
but didn't, out of which rose a. v ion
good to the eyes of athletic fans' The

vision, throwing the basket ball en:

ticiugly lo representatives of the other
classes, who failed to catch it in their
eager arms, allowed the joyous Sophs
thc hard-earned honor and was drag-
ged otf unceremoniously by the gym-
nastic steeds. And now entered those
who looked as tho they were going
some place, all dolled up in galoshes,
iur coats and me widow hats; they
got the laugh that was coming to them
as they gallopcd laboriously over the
difficult hurdles, strewing galoshes in
their wake. We wonder if they
thought their masks hid them, but
we remind them that ostriches with
their heads buried in the sand are
perfectly visible) But the thrills were
not over until the masterpiece of the
Freshmen glided past the bleachers—
a thirty dollar masterpiece of a Sea

let and black dragon with fifty or so
pair of ten dollars a pair spi ug
brogues extending beneath the wri b-
ing skin. '

A fit preliminary to a glorious day!

To One.

 

Building Four sprung a little sur-
prise party on Building Three yestc
day afternoon when they won the ﬁrst
1gnme in the intel‘rmural series by the
‘closc close of 3 to 1. Allho the
ﬁrst game of the season the contest
iwas featured by snappy ﬁelding on
both sides and the excellent work of
‘both batteries.

Both teams ran across their ﬁrst
counters in the second inning when
‘Peterson scored for Four and Edge
'counted for Three on an error at
'third. From there on the contest re-
‘solved itself into a pitching duel with
(neither side able to break the tie. Fin-
ally in the fifth inning with two men
on bases, Burnham cracked out a

long fly which cludod the efforts of‘
,‘Wzlltel's and brought two men home;

‘also won the game.

‘ The game was a pitchers battle from

hit was registered aaginst him in the
whole seven innings and he also had
the enviable record o1

ably lost scveraly more points in the
broad jump when Taylor fell on his
ﬁrst trial and was carried from the

The predominance of freshmen in
the scoring column, while it is highly
encouraging for next year‘s track
prospects, is nevertheless not an es-
pecially good sign for this year's track

the brunt Ol the responsibility will
fall on a few men in whose hands the

the Slovencs had been conquered by
Charlemange and remained for eleven
hundred years in alien control. The
Croats, on the other hand, in the early
middle ages had built up a fail-sized
kingdom. In 11112 Croatia peaceably
united with Hungary, but maintained
its historic rights tcuacmusly, which
now makes it dilficult to (use this

The Croations are aristocratic, bril~

to the Croats are the inefficient but
