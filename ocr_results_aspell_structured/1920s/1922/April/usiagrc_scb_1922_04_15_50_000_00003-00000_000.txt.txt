EDI 011's NOTE

The following is the ﬁrst in a series
or articles dealing with the fraternity
situation in other colleges. it is in
answer to the duestibn: “Do you have
fraternities in your college? if so,
what is their attect on the life or the

situation in a broad way. It is hop-

fact that three trots had been started,
