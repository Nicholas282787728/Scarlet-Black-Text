WE BEG YOUR PARDONE
In [lie “All Fools” issue of the
SCARLET AND BLACK we llllhllsbed
a story entitled “Fraternities Allowed
Abolished By Action oEAus
The following statement

—Secl'ecy
thorities."
was made: “following a long confer—
BDCB with the Hellen-Paulc Council
of the college, held in the club l'ODIn
0? Building Three, the Administration
Committee and members of the Grads
unto Council decided [0 recommend
that all secrecy and rules at the (101‘
lege be abolished and that fraternities
be allowed in Grinnell. It is rumored
that chapters of Delta Phi Rho and
other powerful national organizations
will be installed here"

In the Same issue the editorials
smted that "the essential quality of
the stories submitted for this issue
was that they contain no obvious
truth. Facts, unless adequately twist—
ed into strange and weird shapes,
For this nois—
statement we beg your pardon. The
facts were not all masked but our

have been eliminated.”

readers were given such a congloms
oration that they recognized untruths
for truth and truth for untruth. Hence
it has fallen upon us to restate our
cilse, and that in such a way that there
can be no mistaking it.

At the present time, one fraternity
and three sol'ol‘itieS# o-called—evist
on the campus. The fraternity, with
eighteen undergraduates and some lo-
cal alumni as active members, has
tried to do more than that and has
interfered in outside activities, par-
h‘cularly athletics. They have put
group loyalty above the allegiance due
the college, with consequent compli-
cations. The time has come to settle
the question and that adequately and
immediately. It has been claimed by
members of the organization that
three-fourths of the faculty know
about Delta Phi Rho and are in favor
at it. The SCARLET AND BLACK be-
lieves that this is a deliberate mis-

provc it.
sirabie, why should it be kept secrett
Why should the faculty know about it
but fail to recognize it? If it is of the
type that Grinnel! wants, it is in
accordance with Grinnell traditions
to bring it out into the open and place
it on :t plane Where it can compete
with other organizations here and in
other schools instead of bringing rid-
iculc on the college and being known
elsewhere as ‘the Griunell Kid's Club.’
The faculty has not known about it—-
as a whole. homo few individuals
may have been unmistakably made
aware of it thru its interference with
college work. Now that it is known,
all camouﬂage should be abandoned.
If the fraternity has acted as the
members say it has, if it has been
constructive in its work, instead of
destructive. by promoting campus ac-
tivities, by aiding the Grinnell spirit,

by promoting democracy and unity,
then the members of that organiza-
tlou should justify its existence. The

such expression of opinion and it ‘9“

As stated, the organization at the

men are joint partners in an organi—
zation supposedly for (Lie promotion of
the interests of Crlnnell. In all there

among the undergraduate members.
In fairness to those men, it must he
said that there were also some few
who wanted to become members. The
present number is doubtful.

and it still exists despite statements oi
members to tho cahlral‘yiclhilll that
they have helpod Criunell athletics.
The question is how. There are ten
members of the fraternity who have
made their letters. These men are ten
out of twuty-ﬂve~f0rty per cent of
the number of letter men in college.
They claim that it is to the interests
of local athletics to have the men li\~
ing together socially.

If this is true,

“G” men included in the group? While.
unity or interests makes for unity of
spi t, it is sure that d clique u ithin
such/a group destroys all cooperation.
That this was true last football sells
son is shown by the tact that thc two
best sports writers in this part of the
country declared that there was me
tcrncl strifc on the Grinnell team. In
the Washington game, the St. Louis
reporters announced that with the arts
eeption of one man, tho tcam quit.
In the Drake game, the sports Writs
ers there watched one substitute half
back run several plays without inter-
ference, saw him aid his ”fellow"
backs in every possible way, and then
announced that the Grinnell team
would crack because some men refus-
ed to play with substitutes. It did.

Gi'innell is famed for her sportsmana
ship, for clean, hard ﬁghting
teams, We would rather see Crin—

her

nell lose every game, and be hailed as
ﬁghters, than have a Grlunell team
lie down because the members of a
sub rosa fraternity here 'put group
loyalty above allegiance to their col-
lege. But this appli s only to those
men Who are engaged in athletics and
it would not be fair to neglect the
other men who make up the pruspects
and the faint hopes.
Fortunately, track prospects
little affected by the fraternity. TruE,

are

there are some men concerned with
track but they are in the minority.
The outstanding men in this Sport have
refused to affiliate with such an or-
ganization. But. to be more exotic ,
what the athletes have not had time
to do, the nonsathletes have performed
with gusto. They have been aCllve
ﬁntel‘tﬂinel‘s both at the quadrangle
and othcr places. They have not only
entertained certain favored gucsts
but they have also amused the re-
mainder of the school by their ace
_counts of the affairs. In other words.
they have talked and the gist of lt
has been this "there are fraternities
and sororities in Gl’innell and if you
want to amount to anything here,
you'd better do as we say." The re-
sult is obvious.

if the fraternity has not lived up to
its purpose, howevor high that might
have been orginally, then it should be
routed out and that in such a way
that there Will be no return . It is
painful for most minds to admit that
the past does not furnish us with rc-
liable permanent standards of con—
duct We resent the implication that
things are not going Well and ﬁnd ex-
cuses for turning our backs on dis-
concerting and puzzling facts. We
are full ot a general timidity in the
face of conditions which we vaguely
feel are escaping control in spite of
our best efforts to prevent any thor-
ough—going readjustment. But ln

' What Do You Think?

In 1917 Crinoell put out what is
commonly referred to as her greatest
foot ball team. It was the direct
leslllt of the coaching of McAllnoll
who died the year belorc. ,

The Crinnell Frat boasts of its 23
lyears of being in the college. Per-
,haps it has thought itself essential
lbccause of its long life here but a
thing is essential only when it has
proved its worth. Now it is known
that this Frat is mainly an association
of athletes kept in existence by smile
of the betting ci zens ni Cri’nneil who
would like to run the athletes at the
school.

Have any of you happened to look
back over the athletic history of the
college? When did Crinncll put out
teams that beat universities? When
did Grlnucll put out teams that spread
her fame as a school of athletes over
the middle western stalesl strange as
it may seem it has been all before
nineteen hundred and in the years
191:, 15 and 17. rorhaps there is some
very goods reason for this. Before
1500 there existed no athletic Frat in
Grmuell and during )IcAllllou’s concln
ing here in Grinnell he waged a cons
unuous war against the frat.

I do not know whether “Mike" Au-
gustine, Fuzz Watt, Day, Grant,
“Dad" Hoyt, Oss, .liartln, Wires, or
any of the others of the inn champ—
ions belonged to the frat or not, but I
do know that their spirit was altogeths
or different than the spirit this last
year.

Coach “Bud" Sauudcrs is as good a
coach as Crinnell will ever get. Hc
did not have the advantage that Mc—
Allllml had of knowing the situation
before he came here but he has played
men on their merits as players regard-
less of their being Frat or lloneFl‘nt
men. Now is the time for the college
to clean out the Frat once and for all
so "Bud" Saunders can have a united
team next year that will make
Crlnncll athletics what it was before
1900 and in 1015, 16 and 17.
