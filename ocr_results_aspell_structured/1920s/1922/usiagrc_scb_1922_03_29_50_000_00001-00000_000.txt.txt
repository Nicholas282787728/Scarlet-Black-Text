A most interesting and instructive
talk on “The Origin oi the species"

was given here Monday night when
Mr. William Jay Bryan, who will be
remembered by some few Grinnelliens,
appeared on the local platform under
the auspices ot the Lecture Course
Committee. Mr. Bryan, a man of nae
tion wide notoriety, was secured after
much trouble and expense, lit the
unanimous request of the taculty who
wished to present him with a souvenir
of their appreciation of his work on
the public platform.

Mr. Bryan was unquestionably the
victor in his dramatic monologue here

Monday, and successfully repudiatedl

his ape ancestry in one of his series
of solo performances which he is go-
ing thruout the country. The-audi
once was greatly edihed by his brilli~
ant explanation of our race. and of the
development of the nrst man. lie
ﬂayed evolutionists in general, amidst
the admiring comment of his intellec-
tual audience, and was particularlly
well received by the local scientilic
departments who hailed his speech as
a “masterly producL”

“The scientists talk,” Mr. Bryan
said, “about a little animal several
million years ago who crawled on his
belly, if he had crawled on his back
the whole history 01 the world would
have been changed. He wiggled so
much that he grew a wart. Then he
wigglctl the wart and it helped‘ to
move him along. He turned over on

the other side and wiggled until he
grew another wart. By and by the
warts grew into legsiso say

'sclentists.

“Eyes for the little animal? lrle
stretched out in the sun for so many
thousands of centuries that the sun
picked out the most sensitive part or
his hide and made a freckle there. The
freckle got worse, kept right on
worrying him until it become an eye.
Then he turned on the other side, grow
another freckle and got another eye.

“Why didn't the light waves play
all over him? He Could just as easily
have grown one eye on his chest and
the other on his back or his neck.

MILLER FINDS STILL

Glenn Miller, privntc secretary to‘

Dean Spencer, suspected the presence
of liquor in Central, last week end.
and so he arranged a secret investi—
gation of the whole cottage. in the
basement he discovered a still which
was capable of a so gallon output per
day. The owners of the tilthy ma-
chine are being hunted out, and an
arrest is expected in a few days.

the ,

Colonial Theatre under the auspices
or the dramatic composition class.

The performance was well worked
out, every intricate detaiel was given
careful attention, the cast was extra--
mely well chosen which made it a
ﬁnished production in every sense of
the word. Like all dramatic produce
tions, it had its bright spots and eye
eryone who saw the show will agree
that the honors should be evenly dis-
ti'ibtlted among George Milton Die-
,trich, Burton Jones and Robert D.
Budlong for their perfect interpreta-
tion of the drunken brawl scene. Many
hitter tears were shed during the per-
formance by some of the upperclasy
men whose active minds date back to
lthe passage of the Volstead Act. The
reaction may be likened to hearing a
symphony orchestra concert by wire—
less. The latter‘ was probably due to
the realistic way in which the show
was presented.

We must not pass without making
_mentlon of the charming Way in which
‘A. Stanley Talbott took the part of the
lbal'tender. Although this part was
rather mediocre in comparison to some ‘

ot the others, “Stub" played it to per-
ifecucn, never once getting out of
character,

out the sporting world as “Too Bad
Eddie," won the baud-painted poker
chips for detecting Dean Nollcn, alias
“Johnny the Wop Wonder," in thc ﬁr
not match of the Fuculty club Dutch
Pool Tournar'rrent. Prof. Spencer is
rapidly developing into a cue artist
of the ﬁrst magnitude, and it is his
ambition to some day out—bop Willie
iloppe. He works out daily in Sparks
Pool Palace, eats oatmeal for breaks
fztst and lays off the liquor during the
week.

Prof. Franklin Johnson attempted
to apply a 650 safety razor to his fa-
cial fungi the other day. The latest
report from the Community Hospital
is encouraging—he may die.

Prof. Rogin and Miss Winifred E1157
Worth were seen looking at diamonds

It is rumored that Miss Eleanor-
Lowden hits broken her engagement
for the last time with Dudley David
Griffith. This is the tragic (lenaur
ment of a childhood romance, and the
shattering of lover's tender ties has

Several reasons have been advanced
to account for this sad atlair~some
say the summed pair dillcrcd nor

was another woman in the case—rind
others believe it was all due to a ma
