THE TRACK MEET

An Interscholastic Trdclr and Field
Meet that will inr surpass all prev-
ious records for sitendance is an as-
sured thing ior this coming Saturday.
Two hundred and eighty-tour high
school athletes were entered up to
lost night and the West Des Molnes,
Andes, and Osknioosa entries were not
yet in. These will probably bring the
total up to three hundred and twenty.

The Honor G Club and the Athletic

for the way in which they are hand-

school that they are doing it, but the
high schools themselves and the
teams which represent them are the
primary consideration. The high
schools are eager to enter the meet.
it is by iar the best high school meal
in the state. No other meet can be-

No one need worry about how the
meet will be handled. The work that.
the Honor G Club and the Athletic

prcaoh. They can be counted upon
to discharge their part or the work

coordinate all the various phases at

entered upon an aggressive policy
which aims to solve this problem.
