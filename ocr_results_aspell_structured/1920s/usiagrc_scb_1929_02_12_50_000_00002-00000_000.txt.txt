GATES lil' 'Tl'RlIS DY .\ MYSTIC.

The Rev Dr, Rulus Ill, Jones proves to be as pleas-
ureuble and stimulating as post Gates lecturers.

Just as Gates speakers in other years have been
leaders in a. particular mode of thinking so Dr. Jones
is the foremost mystic philosopher in this country, clhim—
ing followers wherever his books are rend and his talks
heard. Last fall, in recognition ol his place in the phil?
osophical and theological world, he was .1. ed to g' 'e the

THE GR NNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

first resper sermon in the new Chi dga unit-er. ty chitp-
cl of which Charles w. Gilkey, lust yenr's memorial lecr
turer here, is dean. ‘Scal'ccly n week passes when Dr.
Jones does not talk before mine distinguished gathering.
ile recon-ed his D. A. Acsrec iron-l Havorford col-
lege, where he occupies the chair of philosophy, in 1885
and was prominent In ntfuirs them at the time Prof. H.
s. Col-turd was there. His \lews at the time were con-
sidcred too liberal for the Quaker church of which he
is u loader. Probably at. the time he was formulating
his philosophy of mysticism which is characterized by
his inch 01' detail on points considered less important.

TIIE NEW DANCE PROGRAM.

In this issue at the SCARLET AND BLACK npr
pours the new dance regulations as drnwn up by the
Student Council. As was announced last week. various
organizations are to sponsor dances nccepting full 117
spoils ~ both for securing orchestras and making
dances pay out. Already sevcrul organizations have
submitted bids.

The action at the Council seems to have been the
only re 'ondble one under eXlStlng conditions. Through
no ouc's innit, several (lance: have been failures this
year. lmpnssnblc wads kept the orchestra for the
homecoming dance from urriring, two hl zards mode
it impossible for orchestras to play at rnlsities this
winter.

Whether anyone is to blame or not. such a train
of events brings discontent and a demand for a change
or administration Evidently this was clear to the
Council. [or last week it announced that u change would
be made and that the pop committee was temporarily in
rhurge of dancing. While the lateness of the change
made it impossible to secure an orchestra improvised
music drew a. crowd comparable to those which attended

. ies of post your .

The new plfm, .-
tlie confidence ot.the student body. The SCARLET AND
BLACK congratulates the Council on its action.

SUNDAY LIBRARY HOURS

Many students have» been heard to express an opin—
ion that the library should be open Sunday afternoons
for general reading purposes It seems that. such
a. thing would be eutircl~ desirable. It is not suggest-
ed that complete (ncilities be made available on Sun-
day. For instance, bucks could prohably not be checke
ed out and in, and hours would be limited, say from two
to {Dul‘rlhll’Ly o'clock in the afternoon. Why not open
.the “line" in this why to those umong us who might like
to spend u tew hours on Sunday ntternoun in quiet
“mousing?"
