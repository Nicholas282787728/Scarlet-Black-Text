Growth Of World Consciousness
Is Stressed By Speaker
In Chapel Service.

“\l'o *e sloul_\ making headwav
towai-is a ll'mlil consciousness,“ as-
scrtcd Mr. \l" 'am .\. "\lt‘liemel' in
his chapel tall: this morning on the
subject, “The International Mind in
the linking." "of all the nature In
the ii m'ld there is only one humanity,
and human nature hasn‘t changed,"

Mr \cheever stated several time
versal agencies uliicli are at work in
the world. “The motion picture, the
Ford car, the aeroplane and the radio
are all helping to 1 us together a
universal conscience," he said “A
world good is bound to result."

Mr. \lcheci'el' said that he believed
that what counted in this world is
not the increasing oi power, hilt
the learning oi what is in lite and
how to use it. "Give a man a sitllzlr
tion to invent, and sooner or later he
will produce." said the speaker,

“It is seen that some day human
nature will come to commonality. we
will he one people, and will have
peace, War will he a thing of the
past." As an example Mr. McKeevor
cited the American Indian. At tlrst.
they were treated as beasts. Later
someone saw that they were a
people. Now they are on a near
equal plane with us,

"There are four large instincts in
human behavior” he said in closing.
“These are, fllst, the issue for leis-
ure time; second, lhe longing for
Work: third, the social tellowship,
and last, worship and religion.”
