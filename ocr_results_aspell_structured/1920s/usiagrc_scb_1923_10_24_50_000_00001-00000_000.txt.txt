The Pioneers, plarrug an uphill
fight, were nosed out by their old
time rirals, Cornell, in a scusatroual
game at the letters Homecoming, Sate
urday, 17 to 15.

After being outplayed in the iii-st
half, Gl‘innell came back strong in the
nextper ds and nearly succeeded in
snatching victor-y rr-om defeat, but a
referee's decision calling a blocked
punt, that was recovered by a Crirmell
man behind the goal line, a safety,
gave the game to the Cornellians. A
sevent '-yal‘d run by Wing, and a pass,
Sweet to C. Kingery, were the sens. -
tional plays tirat caused Gl'inncll’s
two touchdowns. Kil‘win, Cornell's
versatile fullback, proved to be the
outstanding star or the game, handling
'the ball in three out‘of every four
plays.

Cornell kicked off, and for the first
quarter, a punting drrel ensued, Kir-
win having a slight edge over Scharnc
weber.

Nicolet, Brody, John Stotts, and
Plotts to Meet Drake Team
In Homecoming Match.

A varsity tennis team composed of
Nicolct, Brody, ‘John Stotts and Plotts
has been selected to meet the Drake
acquct wielders Saturday morning
as a part of the extensive homecoming
program.

The former two men have recently
added tennis honors in the toll col»
lege tournament. This will be their
first match, however, in varsity com-
pet ron. J. stotts and Plotts have
becn actively engaged in tcnnis since
their entrance in school, Plotts reps
resented the Scarlet and Black at the
Valley meet last spring at Arnes.

In the doubles, Brady and Nicolet
will compose one team, and plotts
and J, Stotts will play toge‘her. Each
one of the four men will also Com—
pete against a Drake player in single
competition.

 

Revelation of Weird
Mystery Promised
Friday Night.

From the inrster-rous way in u lch
some people or-ourrd the campus are
acting, a Scarlet and Black reporter-
concludes that something unusual is
going to happen about Friday night.

Within the last two days, two Eels
lows on campus havc wired three
times to a \\'Cllvllllu\\‘n Chicago hotel,
and to cap the climax this same hotel
cancd long (listitllce to one of these
fellows last night and bull quite a
lengthy Conversation with him.

Not one word can hc wormed out
of these tenors, and the only thing
they say is, “u it until Friday night.”
And again the Scarlet and Black rec
porter deduees that this special event
will be a big feature of the pep nrcct~
ing Friday night, a feature that will
startle the entire crowd. At any
rate it is a certainty that something
extraordinary will happen at the
big pep meeting.

EIESI IEN MEMBERS

Three Additions Made to the
Business Staff; Seven Elec-
ted to News.

At the regular wcekly meeting of
the Scarlet and Black news and busi—
ness staff held Monday evening, ten
people were Chosen from it list of sixty I
tl'youtel's to fill the vacancies on the
staff. Three were elected to the busi-
ness staif, While seven were chosen
for work on news.

Cole Van Gordon. liaude heachman
and Howard \l‘hitney are the new rep-
l'escniatives ml the business sti'if.
They have had experience in ad Wl‘lL
ilrg and collecting, and will prove ral-
llahle assets to the paper.

Those making the news staff were
Genevieve Ashby, Frances Fettei‘mnn,
Louise Sutherland, Emil Bilharz,
Herold Hicks, Paul Norris, and Ber-
nard Craven. While there were only
[our vilcaucies on the stuff, it was
thought advisible to choose seven ee-
pil'ztnts, thereby doing away with the
customary spring tryouts. Several of
these embryo journalists have had
practical experience, and they all have
marked ability lalong certain lines of
newspaper work.

The staff is now completely filled,
and with the new members taking
regular assigmnent's, the work will be
done in an efficient manner.

Pioneers Defeated by
Minnesota Harriers

In it rather one-sided race, the
Pioneer barriers suffered defeat to
the hands of Minnesota, U. last Saturr
day in a dual cross-Cnuntry run by the
score of 17 to 34.

Gophcl‘ runners captured the first
four places with Meyers, Gl'innell
captain, tailing filth place. The or:
der in which the Glinnell men finishe
ad is its follows: Meyers, Howard,
Wilson, Thorpe, M. Jones, and Wood-
ruff.

The shun-ing made by the Grinnell
entries was rather disappointing to
Coach ”Doc" Huff. It is expected
that ya week of strenuous Work, will
put the men in good hope for the
Drake dual, which will he run this
Saturday morning as a part of the
Hon‘lecninillg program.

Brady and Nicol-ct had advanced to

found the weakness of his opponent
by playing the net. Although Brady

Injuries Keeping Several Men
From Scrimmage; Taylor
to Play Saturday.

With only two more days in which
to prepare for the big Homecoming
game with the Bulldogs, the varsity
football squad has settled down to
hard work in preparation for the most
important contest on the Pioneer
schedule. Coaches Flward and Rug—
ers were not satisfied with the show—
ing made against the Cornell eleven
last week. Consequently this week's
work has been centered upon the
weaknesses or the lost contest.

At the present time the squad is
heavily hit by irriur-icd. Wood and
bare received injuries in the Cornell
game, which will keep them out of
scrimmage this week. It is probable,
however, that these two men, as well
as Taylor, may be able to play in
Saturday's battle. At any rate, El-
war-d will put the best team possible
on the field in an effort to please'the
many alumni and the Crlnncll stu—
dents by winning from Drake.

The many substitutions that were
made in the Cornell game showed that
Elwdl'd had not definitely found the
best combination to make a perfect
grid machine. This matter will have
to be thrashed out this week. Scrim—
mages with the lreshmen, challr talks,
and secret practices will reign su—
preme on Ward iield until Friday,
which will be a day of comparative
rest for the men.
