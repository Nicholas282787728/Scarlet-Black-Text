Generol hints as to the requirements
for a. juurndlist, helped to boost the
assets of Gl-lnell in preparing one for
the newspaper World. "A thorough
understanding of the pztst would give
it definite knowledge of the present,
and experience of the world is on
important factor in the actual Work.
of a newsosper moo." Dean Nollcn
extended a. hordy welcome to the st-
lllosphere of Grinncll,
Organlzutiou of Stuff.

Mr. Charles E. Lyndc of Successful
Farming, gsve the ﬁrst of Lhe speeches
in the dltorial section this morning
when he gsve some pointers on the
organization of: the High school staff.

The’ ﬁrst point which he emphasiz-
ed was that the organization of any
staff is a. matter of personalities.
is absolutely essential that people are
picked Who can work tugetller WiLlJ
the minimum of friction. Friction on
n staff means death to a paper.
People should also be picked who
have distinctive personalitiessper.
sonsllties which make Lhem stand out
from the rest of the crowd and which
mark then] as people of ability.

Loyalty is the second virtue which
every member of the staff must have.
A spirit such as most colleges and
High Schools have must be created in
the staff of the paper. If this is
done it means that every member of
Lhe Stuff will do his utmost to make
that paper a success and is will be 21.
success. This feeling that all are
working toward one end gives that
unity to the whole thing which puts
e paper across us it should be.

Editor and Stuff.
Parhaps the most startling state—

“tliei-a should be no boss" on any

 

paper. His advice to editors, was to

Idecide on u definite program and than guard for first down. Hartwell thrown Critcnctt who signalled for a fair

pl'csrnl it to the stcll in c wuy which
will make them see it as the cditor
does. "But be prepared to indke
sonic concessions," he said. “Do not
be arbitrary. The indirect method is
the best way to accomplish things.
But cbovc zlll, be square with your
stall and keep their confidence."

In conclusion he said, “Don't try to
do things in too big e hurry. Take
your time and build up your paper
slowly. Remember all the time that
the newspaper game, or any business,
is just e big some ﬁnd the same rules
apply to it that apply to any other
game." These rules are, play hard,
play fair snd play to win.

Mr. George 5. stone, of the Chicago
Daily News, was the next speaker, and
his topic was “What is News?" “News
is e ditlieult thing to determine,” he
said, “and it is equally difficult to
decide why tlic amours of Peggy
Joyce are better than the teans of
the Versailles Treety; but it seems
to be true." The only delinetion of
news which he gave was that of d
certain great newspaper editul, “If a
dog bites .1 man it is not news; but
i ro'mau bites s dog that is news,"
This is not always true, however, as
it depends upon thc position of the
items about prominent people
are always good news. ,

As d moons of bettering thcir
pupcrs, he ndvlscd High School edis
tors to widen the scope of their
papers and instend of printing only
news dealing directly with the school
to print local, national, or world news
in summary.

Don't Educate Public.

In answer to the question 01’ wheth-
er it was better m give the public he
kind of news uey want or whether the
public should be educated to the' kind
of news they ought to read, he said
that ﬁnancially it was better to give
them what they want but that ethical-
ly they should be given what they
,should have. The latter is or course
ldesiruhle ii the individual papers
think they can make it psy but the
ﬁrst is the onlyl safe way.

Following the speeches a round
table was held and in this it was
suggested by Mr. Sprogue of West
Des Moiues that as n menus of best
attaining the following o: s definite
policy, as suggested by Mr. Lynde,
was for each paper to adopt slugans
which held the ideal of the paper con»
stantly before them
l liusiudss s clinn. ,

The business section was :eatured
by snappy tnlks by Timothy Le
Quatte, advertising manager of Succ~
essful Farming, and Ralph Moorehcnd,
lo: the Underwriters Review. An in
teresting round table discussion was
held following Mr. Le Qudtte's speech,
which was ended only by the leek of
further time. Mr. Le Quatte gzwe
,ddvice on now to get advertising for
high school papers.

Moorbedd spoke of the various
problems connected with the circula-
tion end of the papers. The round
table discussion following this talk
was ommitted on aecout of the closing
session of the convention, at which
the cups were awarded.

TIME TO STOP

Sinclere Lewis, author of “Main
Street," is fond of lecturing as well as
writing, and the best story be bold us
on his arrival here from America. re-
ferred tn an occasion when he was
holding forth on the subject of metri-
molly.

“Mine has been an ideal marriage,"
he exclaimed (while those whose mar-
ridges had not been‘ideal listened with
pained interest). “My wife and I
share our sol-rows, our joys, our ambi-
tions, our hopes, onr—”

Then. d Scotsman interrupted:

“What about conversation
Lewis?" *

And it is reported that there was
considerable silence—London An-
swers.
