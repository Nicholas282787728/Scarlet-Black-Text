H BOELTER
—H—.—— BOLT....

Bill is a good man and knows football from any
backﬁeld position He is the man who snatched
two fonvard passes and bolted over the line for
the defeating touchdowns in the 1921 Drake-
Grinnell game.

When BOEL’I‘ER gets to Grinnell he will make
another bolt — but this time it will be for the
Grinnell Music (70., Where he always gets his Latest
RECORDS AND SHEET MUSIC.

HOLD ’EM,
GRINNELL!

WILL‘ WE HOLD ’EM?
WILL A DUCK SWIM?

Just watch on: smoke
when the Blue. and
White storms down
toward the Scarlet and
Black goal line.

It’s going to be a ﬁght
from whistle to whistle;
the kind of a ﬁght that
makes the heart beat
quick.

And when the game is
over and you ﬁnd that
Suit of yours is just a
wee bit mussed, we will
give it expert attention.

All you have to do is

'|| HIT THAT LINE—GRINNELL

When the scrimmage starts on Saturday
afternoon and Grinnell is carrying the
ball that line will be hit so hard that all
of Drake University will not be able to
stop the attack.

In the same way the Gifts and Novelties
at Mullins' Gift Shop make such a hit
with everyone who buys them that all
Drake and Grinnell combined could not
stop the satisﬁed purchaser coming back.
