jinstitutcd next year. With 290 pel'r
sdns voting in tile 1)oll,245 pressed
thelnselves‘in favor of Saturday clusSr

Mon )[ore rnvouiblo

An official count of thc votes Cast
shows that the men were lnore flu'o ,
able to tile six—day schedule than \relo
the women. Outot 169 men voting, 148
favored the . day week polic} 0n
the other hand there were 121 women
voting, and only ninety»scven voted
for the present schedule.

The men’s vote has also been tabllr
lated according to classes. There were
si ty-four freshmen voting, of whom
fiftyrfive were in favor of the pres
ent system. Thirty-dii-cc in iavor and
five opposed was the balance of Sop'lwr
mores. The junior vote was thirt -
one to three in favor of retaining Sat»
urday classes, and the seniors voted
likewise twentysnlne to four.

Council Is Sponsor

The attention given to this question
by the faculty committee is the out-
growth or some complaint by students
that Saturday classes make too long
a Week, that some instructors do not
adjust their courses to is Saturday
class, and that it hinders many from
leaving the school over the week-end.
The student council sponsored a popu-

' lar referendum on the .subject, to
which the faculty. agreed to give much
weight in drawing up a schedule tor
next Year.

Since the majority was so over»
wholmingiy in favor or a continuance
ot the present policy, Saturday class»
es Will become a settled {act next
‘year.

Nollen’s Speech

“It is not senile perversity on the
part of the tacuity which has torced
Saturday classes upon you, but the de-
sire to relieve an intolerable tension,"
said Dean John S. Nolleu in a chapel
speech which opened the discussion or
Saturday classes, Thursday morning.

The dean likened the college sched-
ule to ; hotel, Whose capacity was in—
creased 20 per c‘eut by the use or an
annex. As the Grinnell curriculum
expanded it became necessary to use
the annex, which was Saturday, but
the difficulty arose that many people
thought this annex haunted, A low
modern souls declared that there were
no ghosts. but many still believed in
fairy tales and opposed Saturday
classes.

States Question

The question, according to Doctor
Nollen, i "Should we continue Sai—
urday morning as a part of the aca-
demic week (keeping the library open
Friday evening‘ as would he neces-
sary) or are we to lcrcc the ever-
mwingv curriculum back into the air
ready congested Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday schedule? We must either
lorgct the Saturday class bogey or ac-
cept the discomtiture or increased con-
tlicts and lntensiiied space llmltae
tlons."

Dean Nollen pointed out that the
college will continue to grow as it has
in the past, stating that the A. R. 11..
which was intended to sufiice for lor~
by or flity years, is already crowded
to capacity.

Parsons to Speak At

Horace Parsons, president or the
Sunday Evening club, will lead a. dis~
cussion or that group at the Congre-
gational church tomorrow evening,

past two years, and iohn Decker who

much disturbance at the present time.
The school was started by A. B. De
Hand. graduate ot Grinnell in 1906 and
was founded, on the same principle as
an American high school. At present
it is in charge oi Harold S. Mathews.
Grinn‘ell graduate in 1916. During the
past year the school enjoyed the larg-
being in attendance. The students enr
rolled in the Junior middle school fol-
low a course outlined by the Chinese
government board or education while
the senior students choose one of
three courses, the normal. academic.
or commercial. The work given is
similar to that given in the American
high schools and is of such highgmde
that the school is on the list of ac-
credited schools for entrance without
examination to several ot the univer-
sities in China, It is the only high
school in thirty counties in China.

ii-onied with the bitter alternative oi
sanctioning regular Saturday morning
classes, or adding to the burdensome
congestion and consequent annoying
conﬂicts of the M. W. F. schedule, and
thereby wishing x classes a day on
many a registrant, the student body
did not flinch. but voted alincst sol-
idli on the side of the angels.’ To be
exact, the men voted in the proper
tion of seven to one, the women in the
proportion of tour to one, for the Sat—
urday schedule, the total being 35 per-
cent for and 15 against for all the stu-
dents voting, in a democracy like
Grillnell. that ought to settle the mat-
ter tor everybody.

All that roinai is ior administra-
tion and ibculty to keep the library
open Friday evenings and, in next
year‘s schedule, to make a real class
day of Saturday morning, util' ingit so
as to reduce conflicts of hours to h min-
imum; and tor the student body. to
accept the result with good grace, lor-
gct that Saturday is a "dies non” in
high school, and show at least as bold

urday morning as any other. Means

torium at 7:15 o'clock when the Gtilii
nell affirmative team composed of
Clarence Jacobson, Frank Dewey, and
Loren Reid will meet the Iowa state
college team from Ames, debating the
negative side of the question,‘ ”Re-
solved that the essential teet—
ures of the McNary-l-Iaugen bill should

of the Ames team are Eincr Fabricus,

between the two schools. On March 5
a negative team composed of Lawrence
Lunden, Mack. Swigert, and Robert
Burlingame will travel to Ames to de-
bate the same question of {arm re»
lief.

Subject Is Thuely

The debate has token on particular
interest since the bill under discus—
slon has just been vetoed by President
Coolidge. Proponents of the McNarv-
Haugen bill maintain that President
Coolidge hos blasted his‘cbonces for a
third‘ term by snuhbing the middle
west. ,

Those who oppose the bill contend
that the president was right in vetoing
the bill. Since the necessary two-
tbirds majority or congress is deemed
impossible, the bill will be effectively
disposed or for this term of congress,
Tlle members or the Gl'ilmell team
who will discuss the question are all
members of last year's varsity squad.

Prof. Earl D. Strong will act as
chairman at the debate. There will bc

Eoming‘ Lo Gl'inllell with a Constdr
crablo prestige, the Luther college
concert band,ot 60 musicians gave a
concert in the Herrick chapel on
Wednesday night last to an audience
that but slightly out-numbered the
personnel oi the band itself.

At a rough estimate, some one hiiii-
dred or more Ci-innellians _ cortaiir
tortuncte individuals having the
wherewithal in their pockets and thel
love at music in their hearts suliicient‘i
to encourage attendanceiwere pres—
ent to greet and lleill‘ten the music
iausll
can be recorded that it pcrtorined as
finely for that iavored row as it could
or would have played for an audience
crowding the building.

Is Reinarluihlc Organ ion

The Luther college concert band is.
in many respects, a remarkable organ-i
izatiou. Its personnel is recruited
ironi the small student-body oi c lib.
ci-al arts college situated in northern
Iowa. Its llienlbel'ssdl‘e not attcnding
that institution primarily for the put“
pose of studying music; yet, although
the men are amateur musicians, they
have acquired a technique and an
dlllimlli in performance that is usually
associated with the playing oi profes-
sional bandsmen only. The band's
playing evidences incessant practice
and an obedience to authoritative
leadership, and it suggests latent pos-
sibilities which will, it realized, \lltlr
mately'lend the organization on to
firm and unchallenged triumphs.

That the band is a pcrtect organiza-
tion the members themselves would
not claim, but that it is a very ring
hand must be evident to everyone lls—
telling to its playing with keen and
critical ears. Its reed tone is iris
clsive, though rather biting, its brsss
tone.is rich and round. and _'ts tonal
blend is satisfactory in all passages
save those in which the reeds ”push
through." Its musicianship is sound
and arrestingieven spectacular st
times. and it carries with it a soupcon
of dosh and daring sufficient to keep
even the most blase of audiences alert
and alive.

Program Is Eclectic

The band’s program included such
important items as Goldmark‘s "Sak-
uhtulzt" overture, Greig's “Peer
Gynt" Suite, No, 2, and Wegne s
“Tannhausel‘” overture, together with
many of the lighter pieces usually
found on the programs or blind con-
certs, and its eclecticism was evidently
much to the taste or the enthusiastic
audience attending the concert.

To Mr, Carlo A. Spointi, the direc-
tor, should be given the chief credit
for the Luther college concert band's
initial success in Crinnell.
