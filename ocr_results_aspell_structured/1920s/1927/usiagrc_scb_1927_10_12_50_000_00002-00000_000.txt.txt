TABLE MANNERS.

"The taste or beauty, and the relish of what is decent,
just and amiable, perfects the character ot the gentle-
man," says ilr. Shaftesbury, A man who has spent four
years at college, should at least by the end of his col-
lege life have become a gentleman, and one way a gen-
tleman is distinguished from the ordinary man is the
manner with which he conducts himself at the table. .

A stranger eating the men's dormitories would be
surprised to ﬁnd so few men with decent table manners.
what he would find would be a bunch of hungry rowdres
intent upon grabbing enough for themselves without coli-

slderatlon [or the other follows. As soon as the men are
seated at tho tuhlc there is a general reaching tor the
in ad and butter and jam The man who socuros the jam
helps himsoli to hair the dish, and ii his neighbor is
waiting to snatch it out of his band, he gives it to him,
othrrwiss he sets it down in front of him, and begins to
call for the bread and butter, But this is but one ex»
ample Anothor type of individual is the person who is
zllwiu randy to m; e a grab tor the bread, or the veges
tables cvcu it they are being passed down tho othcr sldc
or the table. Such actions remind one or a hungry boast
air-aid he will not get enough to eat and in order to be
sure that ho docs, he must get it before the other chap.

A collcgc graduate should go out into his prepared
to conduct himself proper , under all circumstances. If
a man has not lliul an opportunity to learn table manners
at home. he should be taught them at college, and any
collogo man should realize the importance oi knowing
how to act decently at the table; it is part of a gentle-
man. Perhaps a mltn during tour years at Grinnoll college
will absorb some tablc manners from the tow men who
do have some bit or rcfinoment,

ARTHUR C. RISSER,

THE STAG EVIL.

Four years ago it was with dirliculty that the recrcs
dtion committee instituted "tag" dances. Even then the
men “cut in" only on their very close friends and cons
sidered it a breach of etiquette to tag any one else.

But the custom has grown until now cutting in at
the var 'ty dances hits approached it state of rudeness.
The wall‘ is lined with stags who are unable to or "don't
care to" get a date with a girl who can dance. However,
they do care to come to the dance and cut in on the host
dancers, whether they linow the girls or not. They rilder
ly interrupt conversations and sail oft with the lady-fair,
leaving her escort standing bewildered in the center of
tile tloor. We know of several men who scarcely ever
have a date of their own but are always prescnt at the
dance and inure than ready to cut in on a girl with whom
they Cullldnt’ get a date if they tried.

It is perfectly all right to cut in if they have a date
at the dance, but otherwise it is decidedly bad form. We
recommend that the recreation dance committee eithcr
torhld stags on the danco floor or else charge them double
the regular price of admission. Since they are trying to
save money, either way would be eflective.

Quad Girls Hear First Serenade
Of Year Monday Under Full Moon

Thrills and heart tin-obs: The girls
of the Quad were treated to their ﬁrst
serenade of the season Monday night.
About ten—thirty, just after the lights
hzld gone out in the freshman cot—
tages, and nearly everyone was in bed,
strains of old~time ballads driitcd in
through the open windows.

or course the upper classmcn knew
at once what was happening, and all
rushed across to the rooms overlook-
ing the logia. Even though the new
girls had heard oi the tradition that

every year the men came over and
serenaded the women, nothing' had as
yet materialized, and they began to
think it was merely a practical joke.
With the first measure of “My Bonnie
Lies Over the Ocean,” as if by instinct,
they stopped brushing their teeth,
combing their hair, or applying cold
cream, and scrambled for the roof
garden.

A Wonderful moon, soaring through
the light-flaked sky, sbono down on a
queer mass of pajamas and bathrobes,
The night might have been made for
the occasion, it was so warm and mo-
turesque, or perhaps the occasion was
made for the night. ' ,

Scattered around on the roofs ot
the other cottages, sat digniﬁed (?)
sophomores, juniors and seniors. Dure
ing the songs, everyone sat in still-
ness, even the black cat.posed as a
statue down on the campus, listening
to the singing. At the end oi each
selection, however, a deatening chorus
of acclarnation arose from each group,
wishing more. ‘

After singing such favorites as "I
Ain’t Got Nobody,” "Home Sweet
ﬂame," and ”My Wild Irish Ruse," the
freshman quartet drifted on, to sing
to the girls further down the line.
As a. ﬁnal proof of their appreciation,
