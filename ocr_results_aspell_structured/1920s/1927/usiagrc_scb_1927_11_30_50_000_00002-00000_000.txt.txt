to have niimeographed copies oi the chapel speeches
passed out at the door and to allow the student to read it
himseli rather than to have it read to him. it the speak-
er must have notes. all right, but his primary purpose
should be to speak to the students, not at them.

We believe that ii the chapel speakers could hear
some oi the remarks that are made when they cannot
read their own writing and have to stumble for words,
they would give us speeches, which seem sincere, rather
than readings, which seem periunctory.

The diiily reading lesson, we believe, is the reason
for small chapel attendance; the larger audiences at
music chapel bear out our belief.

THE BEST POLICY.

The old maxim that ”Honesty is the best policy" has
been used for so long that it is looked upon as a joke.
Let any one mention honesty to a person and he immedi-
ately is laughed at by those around him. No doubt it is
because they arc'so honest and honorable themselves that
they think it is a waste or time to speak about it. How-
ever, ihis maxim, is one by which a person cannot habitu-
ally be guided. Some one has said, that, "an honest
man is always before it, and a knave is generally behind

There is no questioning the root that the conscien-‘
tious students, the men and women who come to college ,
with a mind ior research, and a purpose to learn, believe
i , and uphold the principle or honesty. But there are
in the colleges people who come not ior knowledge, not
because of an eagerness to becomeacmiainted with the‘
world, but who come merely ior social pleasures. Inci-
dentally such people have to get grades in order to
remain in school, and as they have no real. honest
interest in learning, they resort to the simplest method
at retaining their social standing. These persons are
not dishonest, nor are they insincere with their profes-
sors. They are not taking a certain course because
they want“, it will do them no good, but it is required,
and their aim is to get through with it as soon as
possible, without being classed by their iellows as
"dumb." A,rnan who writes an exam in English litera-
ture with his book open heiore him. expresses in actions
to the class the fact that he is in school, not because he
wants to ﬁnd out what he has learned and what he has
not learned, hot that he is more desirous or it grade.

OUR DAILY READING LESSON.

The chapel service at Grinnell should be one at
the dominating elements in giving the student a broad
ened outlook on life. It can have a greater influence in
formulating a student‘s philosophy thanany departmental
course. Chapel should he considered thoughtfully.

The faculty decries the small attendance at our
daily service. And yet, can you blame a student for not
going to chapel all the time? What does he hear about
nine times out. of ten? Some one reads a monologue for
fifteen or twenty minutes, unniindiul of the yawns 0!
his audience and its stirring in the seats. As we have
suggested hetore. it might be just as well in many cases
