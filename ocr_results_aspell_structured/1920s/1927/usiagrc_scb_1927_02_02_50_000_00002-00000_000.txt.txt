Glillnell entels‘ a new field of athletic competition to-
night push the swimming team competes 111 a dual meet
with Diake unii-eisity, at Des \loines. ,

While the inexperienced Scailet and hlack tanklncn
are not doped to win the meet from the seasoned Bulls
dogs, time will permit the development of teams which
will some day capably can on the brilliant athletic rec
ord of the “greatest little track college in the world."

The New York Evening Post once carried an article
on Grinnell as the "god-mother of Athletics in Iowa." ln
1868, Grinnell played the first game of collegiate base-
ball in Iowa, with the University of Iowa and in laid the
Pioneers defeated the University in the first game of
football played west of the Mississippi. .

Grinnell introduced track, basketball and soccer ‘in
Iowa. The Scarlet and Black has won state laurels ill
,track and field competiti'un ten times, the state basketball
title eleven times, and the state football title seven
times. ‘

Swimming is a comparatively new phase of athletic
competition but the forward strides of the sport the past
few years bid fair to soon place the summer pastime
among the favorite forms of athletics At the present
time the Christian Science Monitor is giving more space
to swimming than any other indoor sport, including
wr.estling The health benefits, alone, will justify .the
development of the aquatic diversion

May G1 muell’s piowess in swimming prove to be as
outstanding as her records in other fields of athletic coin-

THREE H01 “NATIONS.

The three-hour examinations proved a highly popu-
lar plan among the students last week. Not only was
the method popular, but in the estimations of valious
faculty members, very successful

The primary purpose of the change from the tworholll'
period was to allow the slow thinker a better chance. 011
that particular motive, there is hardly reason to justify

the [lJl‘eerllolu‘ c. tmiliutiou. College students should not
be excused on the ground of slow thinking.

But the new plan does catch that class of liluffers
who always fail to answer several questions and invari-
all igii their papers "1 tlitlll'l. have time to 1111 h." it
llois giic morc time for preparation and it does dIStl'lllutli
the examinations more fa Fol'lncl y, students some
timcs had tllrco 11.1111 exilninatiol, g ouped on one day,
a decided disadvantage. Those the benefits out»
standing. ‘

True enough, if examinations are the proper length,
students are forced to eliminate part of the “blah," rc-
g- rded as - essential to good gradcs iii many courses,
The three-hour period does offer an opportunity to that
class of students who write three booklets where one
should suffice. However, that situation should be given
proper treatment by the individual instructors,

\Vith very few exceptions, reports indicate that era
aminnuolis were of the [\l'orllotlr variety, as the faculty
had promised, The plan has received the endorsement
of the student body which passed through the semi-an-
nual ordeal Inst week. A, c.

WHAT’S lT _u I. ABOUTi
Five freshmen at Cornell university recently sent forth
a belligerent question to the university at large: "What
is it all aboutt”

The freshmen had spent two monthsat the univen
sity, and in that time had found “no coherence, no pure
nose, in their college studies," according to The New-Stir
dent. So they wanted to know what to do. The cola
loge newspaper answered that an orientation course, like
that at Columbia university, should be given to all fresh-
men as a rudimentary preparation for the real college
work

P1 ohdbli .my iiumbci of freshmen 111 o1er the coun»
try 11ould agree, if they uislied to be perfectly holiest
about it, with tllosc Cornell student, Especially those
first year students in state universities of Nebraska’s izc
would be willing to admit that they spent their entire
first year in a date, and that the real comprehension or
the university attitude as contrasted with the high school
l'leullulut did not come until well along in the second
year.

Cornell's suggestion of an orientation course is a
good one, but it is hardly adequate. The real cause of
this bewilderment to which thc five freshmen contessed
can be found 111 a statement recently made by Dean Wu!»
ters of sivarthmure. Registered at the Unive ity of
California he said, are 17,101 full time students; and at
Columbia university in New York. 12mg, Without :1
doubt, these figures explain something. They obviate
the theory that in universltlcs of such a s .e it is impos-
sible to give attention to the individual; the natural cor-
i-olary being that some»thing is needed to make
individual capable ot finding out what everything
about. if no one can take the time to tell a freshman
what he wants to know. and to set 111m right in his new
environment, then some means must he provided which
will enable the freshman to tell himself.

The solution is not easy. Perha
in Glenn Frank's new plan which is under way at the
University of Wisconsiniﬂle preparatory college. This
plan involves a sort of junior college, a two-year course

is

11 liich will aim at fitting the student {hi the real special-‘

ized u ork which is commonly known as “higher educ.
tion. The student in this college will fiist complete a
t\\‘OJyef\l general course, and will then cutei the college
proper, consisting of two or three additional ye‘ of
study, largely specialized. According to the theory, the
student at the end of two years will be prepared for his
additional work, and will be able to enter it with a
knowledge of what he is stepping into,

The Wisconsin idea is believed by many to offer a
remedy for the fault which is at the bottoln of the prob-
leln suggested by five Cornell freshmen. That fault is
that there is too big a gap hetweecn high school and unis
versity. The individual or institution which finds the
flue remedy for this fault will be performing one of the

, est educational feats of all time—The Daily Nebra ,

Editor Scarlet and Black,
Dear sir.

i am not familiar with any previous
discourses on the grade system, of
which you may have heard- 1 write in
answer to nobody, and expect to ex
pericnce no soul stirring reforms. I
wish merely to reveal to the novitiates
methods whereby they nlity be shrlven
of their cons.

There iutrudes upon our vision the
unfailing iopnotcher, first of the .117

but recently \oiced or recommended by
the Smudger of the Classbook, His
hand is a semaphore which is 1nd

makes. Intelligence beams from his
eyes and at the proper moment he is
wont to nod his head in fitting aDDl-o~
bation of a crafty statement. He at—
tends to the little points and assign—
ments, for such attention makes the
