Down the walk and to the rigirt
through the prison greenhouse where
the work is done entirely by the in-
mates. it is not thc custom of the
officials to take visitors through the
chain. room but from the
sx-ecnlrou. the 'chaplain letl
the par . into “the room or
death." in a manner more fitted to
the hardened business
“man or God” described the working
of the execution chair. The chair is
of home construction " It follows
closely the room comfortable style of
the mission type of lounge chair.
straps are f -tencd to it fit conven-
ient places in order to he t‘astened
around the u- st, ankles, chest and
tread cf the persons to he executed,
An electrode is attached to the left
nnklc. a helmet containing a rubber
sponge is placed on the shaven Dean
of the convict and the mask is adjust-
ed. The doctor sumding near the
man who is about to die signals when
the victim cxhales and the current is
passed through-his body. The man
immediately becomes unconscious and
soon dies. If the current were [lasseu
through the body when air is being
inhaled the lungs would burst and
make death painful.

In the six years that the chair has
been in use but five men have been
electrocuted. An electrocution is sche-
duled for early- next month and two
other convicts will receive the maxi-
rnnm punishment later.

Employ Inmates

Like most state prisons, the Nehras
ka institution employs the inmates in
work which will help in the mainten-
ance of the prison. Three hundred-
fitty of the inmates are employed in
the shirt making shop. Here they
earn twenty cents a day. Connected
to the shirt factory is the furniture
factory where seventy men make
wicker and high grade overstutied
furniture. Here the men are paid by
the piece and it is possible for it works
or to earn as high as seventy-five
cents a day although the average is
ahont fifty-five cents.

Believing that all work and no play
make dull prisoners the authorities
have an ex nsive program of l'ecre~
ational acti ties in operation. The
prison baseball team has not been de-
feated by any of the teams around
Lincoln which have conre into the far.-
son to play.

Kitchens Well Equipped

The kitchens cf the prisoners‘ di-
ning hall are as well equipped with
steam cookers, coffee urns, stoves and
ovens as the pest hotels. prisoners

ho have been chosen as bakers and
cooks work here on day and night
shifts, The dining room is large and
ras an atmosphere of cheer. The men
eat in three sittings at each meal. Four
men eat at a table and when the lar-
gest group is eating a gunman is in
he cage near the front of the room,
The men are given as much food as
they can eat put they must eat every~
thing they mks.

From incoming room the chaplain
led the party down several steps into
the school rooms where prisoners may
come for instruction in the common
branches and in Bible training. These
courses are entirely optional but most
of the men who have not had a chance
to study before avail themselves of
this opportunity. litany men are taken
into the Chirstian faith during the
course of their prison life.

Unlike the dungeons of the days of
the old criminal codes, the cells where
the men are lockd at night are me-
dern. The cells are five feet long, se-
ven wide and nine high and are fur-
nished with two bunks, electric lights,
running water and individual toilets.
Mail is delivered daily. The prisoners
are allowed to furnish the cells as
elaborately as they wish at their own

 

Bahhit the ‘

expense. Pictures of movie and stage
stars, magazine covers, hunting, and
mottccs are on the walls of the narrow
rooms.

When a man is in his cell he is be-
hind four steel doors in the cell house
alone. It is possible for the guards
to opcn and shut from five to fifteen
doo s at a time by means ol‘ electric
lcr

‘ Lili-r Phillis Decorations

A large auditorium serves the dual
purpose of movie theatre and chapel.
The-chaplain has one movie a week
tor the men and conducts religious
services here. An orchestra composed
{of inmates led by a “liter” furnished
music for various prison functions.
Tire walls of the auditorium are decor-
ated with paintings by a negro lll'e
inmate.

When the party entered the library
the chaplain rcniinisced acnt some of
the more spectacular attempts at es-
cape which have happened recently.
One of the most unusual was the dis-
suisiug in women’s clothes of a life-
sentence man. He had made the
clothes from the furniture upholster-
ing of the factory in which he Worked~
Hc attempted to leave the prison with
a large crowd of visitors and had
reached the outside gate before being
recognized. Fred Brown, the chaplain
said, had attempted to “shoot” his way
out or the prison with a dummy gun
made of tin, wood and leather.

As one leaves the prison one sees a

 

sign which reads: "Goodbye and Good
Luca"

Colonial To Feature
South Sea “Paradise”

Coloriul South Sea Island scenes;

Art Ball; one of the groatestscresu
battles in history between Milton Sills

tropical island, and a hitter struggle
between a stclid, wealthy man and
the ne'er-do—well soil of an English
nobleman.

Those are a few or the highlights
of First Nationals latest Milton Sills
