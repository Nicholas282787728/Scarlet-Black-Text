THANK YOU, PRESIDENT MAIN.
We are indebted to rresideiit Main tor his statement
oi Grilllwll’s athletic policy, setting at rest a widespread
certainty about our tuture in that brunch oi college
he one who llodril tho rigorous pronouncement
we could rail to admire the clear sighted
y sion winch has brought Grilnlell to so high a station
in the educational world. No student among us but
felt a desire to make the years to come as bright for
tirinnell as the years past have been. It the SCARLET
AM) BLACK has been at all responsible for the wide-
spread interest shown in this important problem, we are
glad to lmre rendered that campus service.

X0 one believes that a satisinctorr application oi the
president's policy has yet been found, least oi all Presi-
dent Jinin himself. The iaet stiIl remains that Grinnell's
attitude toward athletics diifcrs widely from that oi nny
other school in the Missouri Valley conference. We can-

. not at one time say that it is a great honor to belong
to that group aml in the next breath condemn a practice
which eyes-y other member iollows. It is eminently
nuiair to ourselves that we be penalized by maintaining
dii rent standards irom those of the institutions ,with
it'llltll we compete. 0ne oi three courses remains open:

1 mar, accept the prevailing customs and change our
own policy.

schools to meet our own.

THIRD, term a new conference embodying the Grin-
nell principles. '

The ﬁrst alternative has been deﬁnitely cost aside
by President Mnin’s pronouncement. The. second seems
a bit ludicrous‘in riew oi Grinnell’s rather minor roice
in conference councils. The third would be a gnlliug
admission oi defeat and would be hailed by persons

WHY HAVE EDITORIALS?

li a student paper has any excuse ior existence at
all, it is to e pr opinions which would and expression
in no other i u hen editorials some up other purpose
than to ﬁll up space and put people to sleep, they are
railing to meet a rent campus need and are iurthermore
crawling out news ullich otherr so might be printed.

but when editorials strike, some ritnl note, when
they act men and \l‘unlt-n to tlunluug about something
which ues yes thought, then they a not only crews-
able, but illtlislwnsiblo. They become the heart of the
publi tiou. In metropolitan dailies and serious maga-
zines, editorials should deal w r subjects oi widespread
importance and interest. but it is utterly out or place
tor a college newspaper to discuss such Inntters as the
latest retolntioll in Zanzibar, when that iuiormation can
be better gotten elsewhere.

it is the particular job oi the so min: '1‘ AND BLACK
to point out no s in which (y'rillnell may be improved
and to tulli about sllbiccts which relnte to our liie as
students. it hen it does that whether it be right or wrong,
it is ﬁlling its place. No topic is too lowly ior mention
in in column, so long as it concerns us in our relation
to tiriuwell. Sometimes the editor will be wrong in
his yiewpoint and more ireonently many will think him
wrong, but so long as he t-lllls attention to something
Him, a seniee is rendered.

.lll is not perieet here, and only by best rring our-
series to remedr the most glaring imperiections can we
more (:riuneil mean what it should to the Grilnlell
iamily. It. B.
