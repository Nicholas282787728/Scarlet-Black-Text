cussion was used Each team was

‘Colllbst Production.

The audience which \\ as impressed
by the realistic drama of “The Fool”
has promises of deeper and lnore sin-
eel-e emotional cliec - when it attends
“The Vlllirtllt," a oilerﬂct play by Hole
worthy Hall and Robert Middlcmass
to be ill-eselllrd by two cas chosen
froln the tryouts held rocentl, From
these two casts, an fillrstal' group
will be selected by a special commit.
tee, to represent Grilllloll in the na-
tlonal play contest held in the Uni»
versity theatre tournament at Northr
western, April 21722.23.
Play is Di lieult

This contest play is probably the
most difficult and powerful drama
ever attempted by Grllulell's dramatic
department. Every one of the five
people cast for "Tile Valiant" has a
real job. Each character plavs a vital
part in the powerful sto which
moves in a deliberate and effective
mood.

ll James llllclt and Paul Kene»
i‘lck ccntcsting their talents in the
title role of James D. e the prisoner.
premises of close rivalry appear.
James Dyye has been jailed for mur-
der and condemned to die but is her
lieved to be shielding someone else.
His life has evidently been that of a
dzlyrdl'eilmer and rather unsuccessful
hut in spite of these faults he detere
lulncs to go through with this one
thing and lace death. He defies the
pleading of the warden and refuses to
give information other than that he is
guilty. Josephine paris, to be chosen
among Louise Barton, Eleanor Dun-
ton and Hope Houston, begs to know
if Dyke is her brother. As she and
her brother constantly quoted and en-
acted Shakespearc together when
children she believes that by uuoting
Shakespeare to the prisoner. she will
remove the barrier of grim determina<
Lion and stubborness, and thus identr
ify him. But her test fails and she
therefore believes her brother died
gloriously on the battlefield of France.
However, Dyke really is the brother
and on his march to death he grimly
but tenderly quotes Shakespeare cone
stantly: "The valiant tastes of death
lnlt once."

Flu-Ce Hits Good Cnst
Besides this sincere, yet lovable
drama, a fascinating and hilariously
good farce is being presented, titled
"The Love of Pete" with a selected
cast.

This Experimental Theatre program
will probably be the most attractive
and creditable given for some time.
The fact that dramatic merit will be
rewarded offers the audience assur-
ance of the highest type of perform-
ance.

The casts fur the two plays are:

Foster Riilelort, lone Grinnell entry
in the Taylor relays at Austin yester-
day, was forced into second place in
the shot event by Lyons, Illinois, who
tossed the brass weight 47 feet lei
inch. This mark is inferior to sev
cral that Rinefort has made this year,
and in today’s meet at the nice lnsti.
tutc games at Houston, the Pioneer
captain may reverse the tables.

lliaufurt Hiilitliclippoll

Rinefort also competed in the .l'
cus event, but reports indicate til
the Grinnell star did not place in that
event, Lack of sufflclent outdoor
practice is given as the reason for his
inability to score. Lyons has been a
typical “inrandeouﬂ performer this
season, having tossed the shot well
over 47 feet in a dual meet prior to
the llliilols relays, but ldiled to place
in the latter meet, Rinefort winning
by several feet.

lowa State is credited \Vilh setting
up two new marks for the carnival,
winning the two-mile and medley re-
lays in fast time. The Cyclone ruli-
nel-s ran the twdmile event in 3 min—
ute 27 seconds, and the medley re-
lay in 7 minutes 45) 4-5 second.

The Missouri Valley conference can
also lay elailn to another record for
the meet. Farley, Missouri speedster,
stepping the 1001/:de specialty in
:93, lowering the record from 10:1.
lll winning the event Farley defeatcd
Alderman and Grim, the two Michigan
state stars, who have betwecn them
garnered most of the indoor champ-
iollships of the middle west, to date.

Complete Again Tnllily

New records ill the ifdeyal-d, 880.
yard, relays, broad damp and the shot
put were established. Athletes from
all over the United States competed
for the awards of the University of
Texas in the meet: Practically the
same performers will race again this
afternoon in the nice games, and with
the continuance of good weather,
these athletes may hang up records
evcn better than those of yesterday.

Students of San Diego State col»
lege have abolished the tradition of
hazing its ft practice "unbecoming to
all institution of higher educational
