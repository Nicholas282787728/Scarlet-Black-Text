In a debate cu. acterized by dull—
ness and mediocrity on both sides and
by unpreparedness on the part of
Allies, Grinnell and Iowa state college
clashed on farm relief in the A. R. H.
auditorium Saturday evening. .

The Grinnell team, composed of
Clarence Jacobson, Drank Dewey and
L'orelpReidn upheld the lllcthl-y-Huuo

Coolidge had vetoed on the preceding
day. Ejner Fabricius, Raymond Mon-
ahau and Loren SCllindel, represent-
ing the state college, maintained that
the bill should not be adopted.

Clash on Solution \

Both teams agreed that the middle
western farmer has been facing a
critical problem during the past few
years. Jacobson maintained for the
affirmative that Orderly marketing
Will solve the difficulty, and that the
McNary-Hnugen bill is primarily de-
signed to provide sound marketing

freight rates, taxes, and the banking
system are at the root of the farmer's

‘_”i'lle F001," the play which the Dru-l

a living play. The plot center.
around Daniel Gilchrist, a young,
clergyman who has decided to live
as he thinks Christ would live wer
He on earth today.

The masses never believe in new

were constantly looking for ulterior
motives. Just so with young Gilchrist;
feu- ulidelstnod him and he is dubbed
a fool.

“The Fool" asks the question, "Can

so, is it worth while? These are the
qeustions that every thinking Chris-
tian must answer some time for hiln-,
self. It is this applicability to every-
mnn that has made the play so popu-
lar.

Daniel Gilchrist is not a colorless
spirit apart from the world. He is no
abstract theorist. He is a real man
who tries to think through the prob-
lcms of life in 'a real man's world.

Sophomore Cage Teiilll Comes Back ill
Second Hltll' to Defeat Juniors
Ill Scrappy Battle.

Sophomore women yesterday afte.
noon defeated the junior cagc team by
a score ol 24-10 in one of the scrap-
biest basketball battles that has been
staged in Rand gymnasium in recent
years. Hard, clean fighting and spec-l
tacular bursts of fast playing featur—
ed the game from start to finish, the
score bcj g little indication of the
competi on that kept both teams on
their toes throughout the game.
Juniors Guard Closely

Superior guarding on the part of the
Junior guards, Towner and J. Morri-
son, kept the sophomore score down
to 5 during the first half. The junior
team was unable to break throughror
any score, but succeeded in giving
their opponents a struggle for every
point .

Both teams came back in the sec-
ond half with nndiminlshed fight and
got away to a flying start. Snappy
team work on the pal-L of the sophcla
mores soon piled up the score, Wil-
son and Stafford tossing a series of
pretty baskets during the half. Aided
by the strong support of their centers,
Stevens and Greaser. the juniors rallv
ied in the third quarter and succeeded
in throwing five baskets before the
end of the game. The sophomore for-
wards continued to score consistent-
ly until the game ended with a beau-
tiful field shot by Wilson in the last
ten seconds of play.

No Individual Stars

The hard and consistent playing of
both teams made it impossible to Sin-
gle out individual stars. Keen compe—
tition in the center was a feature of
the game, Stock and Ruthlerford mut-
ching evenly on the tossup. The work
of Dow, junior captain, as running
center, was uniformly brilliant,
though Schwarz succeeded in offer-
ing strong competition. Dart and Met—
calf displayed speed and teamwork
which kept the ball out of the hands
of the junior forwards during most 0(
the game.

Peterson, Head Waiter At Dorms,
Learns New Tune On Dining Cong

A howling, blood thirsty mob surges
again and again against a pair 0?
doors, voicing menaces and lmprcca-
ticns with impatient gestures. Behind
thos‘c doors a white coated tigure
s‘w with arms folded serenely. un-
perlmbcd by the frenzied figure.‘ held
in leash by only the frail doors. The
tumult grows wilder: the doors quire.-
on ttcir hinges and the sturdv lock
gives until it must break. As the
clock strikes twelve—thirty the soil~
tary figure steps forward fearlessly
and throws back the bolt.
Flood Yours Through

The flood of men pours through,
sweeping everything before; many are
hurled brutally against the door—
jamb: broken glass tinkles on the hard
floor; the weaker men are trampled in
the rush; the doorman leaps for safe—
ty but the flood catches him, pushes
him down, overwhelms him. The mob
is quickened by the scent of food and
scatters through the stately pillars of
the dining room until all are seated
at the tables.

For some minutes no alien sound
disturbs the muffled clutter of knife
and fork and the subdued gnashing of

 

teeth. The noise of many laws beats

through the apartment like the eter-
nal waves hurled against a l'ockl'
coast. ‘ it rises and subsides: rises
and subsides, gradually gaining VOL
umo until it seems the noise can
never he stopped.

stillness—“Who—who is the wonder-
