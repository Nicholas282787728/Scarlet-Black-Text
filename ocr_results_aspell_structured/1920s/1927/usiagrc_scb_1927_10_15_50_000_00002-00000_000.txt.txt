disappointments or the students is that the grad seems
to regard them as children, and they therefore fail to

item in which Grinnell college life is lacking.

We would suggest in place of the notorious scandals
a plan similar to that followed in the University of North
Dakota and which is termed there the "Flickertail Fol—

the prominent organizations, mostly fraternities and sore

acts in the final show, making a program of about three
hours, Prizes are awarded to the organizations whose
acts are rated tirst, second and third. The show creates
a great deal of r airy and enthusiasm among the stu-
dents and has proved highly successful.

“Ask Me Another” Disease Reaches
Proportions of Plague On Campus

Starting as an almost unnoticeahlc
and apparently harmless intoetion the
”Ask Me Another” disease has reached
the proportions of a plague accor 'ng
to statistics taken on the Grinneli
campus recently. The most suscentlv
ble victims to this malady- seem to be
the students themselves. one partic-
ular group have been afilicted so bad-
ly that the s. P. c. A. is expected to

be recognized by sopeesharnened pens

when not in use (which is very rare),
reams of scrap paper somewhere about
them, and a 100k of impassined hope-
fullness as they eye each passerhy in
search of news, customers, knowledge,
or what have you?

“Ask me Anathema,” altlmugh it has
the general demoralizing effects, is

Victims of Maltesaria are no less
bothersome. They are, to make things’
more complicated, divided into two
divisions. Those with ltlaltesar-ia ed-

any good jokes?" all through the day

"There is no real need for increas-
ing our nary, Tire United states and
Great Britain hare not been at war for
over a hundred years, although man)
complex diilorences have arisen he-
twcen them during that period. To
the minds or nrost of the Engliish
people, war with the u. s. is untllinll—

‘Sfrttes regard a war with Great Elit—

ain to be equally inconceivable.

largely settled. Today Japan is too
intelligent to go to war with it coun-

depends for :\ large share of her m-

as to expect it Texas cowboy to milk a.

"At the Geneva couterence, Great
Britain and the United States agreed
to have an equal number of cruisers,
and to allow for a tutti! tonnage of
