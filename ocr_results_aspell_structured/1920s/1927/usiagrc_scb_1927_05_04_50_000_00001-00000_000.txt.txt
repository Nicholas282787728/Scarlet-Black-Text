Philosophy Is Now
A Frontier—Perry

Speaker Says Intellectualism Has
Replaced Physical Side In ,
Pioneering.

”Philosophy may be sain ' to be the
intellectual frontier. The physical
frontier has ceased to exist, but the
passing or the intellectual frontier is
not yet in sight," said Pr-or. Ralph
Barton Perry in his address, “The
Spirit of Philosophy” given at long
chapel this morning. This is to be
his last lecture in Grinncll. In irr-
troducing the speaker President Main
sai , “We appreciate the opportunity
of accepting Professor Perry's higher-
educational ideals,"

"There are many drawbacks to’ be-
ing a professor of philosophy," the
speaker said. "People do not usually
ask what things mean. The philos.
cpher, perhaps, ought to be marked.
He is supposed to be one who iceis
himself ediiicd and omniscient and
what can you decently tell a man
when he thinks he knows everything?

Wrurts To Know llIciIiiing

“A philosopher is above all per»
sons interested in what things mean.
He seeks to know subjects. His call-
ing is to know some aspect of the
truth and to record‘it for others so
that they may apply it as they will.
No sane philosopher claims to be om-
niscient. ‘

“Philosophy has become an empty
title," Prof, Perry said in part. The
philosopher is often tolerated as a
concession of the past. His territory
is occupied_lry the special sciences
and it would seem necessary thatphil-
osophy disappear. Nowadays special-
ization is knowing a great deal about
very little, 'and you know more and
more about less and less until you
know everything about nothing. That
is a philosopher. Generalization is
knowing little about a great deal until
you know nothing about everything.
That is a sociologist.

Knowledge Subject to Alteration

,“So long as knowledge is liruited,
it is subject to radical alteration,
Philosophy attempts to get to the bot»
tom of things, to obtain a knowledgc
of things is their ultimate aspect. The
task of philosophy is to abridge cone
ccptual abstraction and intuitive inv
sight, The philosopher enlarges in
scale as he enlarges in scope in his
cosmic landscape. His is that branch
of knowledge which seeks to be pro-
ionnd at the risk of abstractness sud
incxactness.

“Philosophy lies at the end of a
road on which e$ery man has gone a
certain distance,” the speaker went
on. “It is better that the public des-
pise a philosophy which they do not
under-stand. There are four relative
problems, ultimate reality, cause,
truth and value which correspond to
metaphysics, cosmology, theory and
ethics. A man runst come to feel his
individuality as one earth or one
realm.

Diiicreuco in Appearance, Reality

“One must never take reality at its
lace value, There is a difference be-
tween what things seem to he and
what they really are, Theory battles
with theory and the question remains.
A theory is no truer than the iacts
that aliirm it. The questions which
philosophy asks are all familiar ones.

”There are the lmmemol‘lztl doubts
of philosophy. It does not always
claim the solution of a. problem but
claims [but the moblem is there. It
is a feast of reason, it contemplation
all truth. Reason is pre~emlnently
man’s natural function," the Speaker
said.

"Critical doubts Me what move the
world. The passing of the intellect-
ual frontier is not yet ll: Sight, and
the real philosopher makes crude
charts of the regions beyond. Some

Next Saturday,

EAST HIGH DOPED W‘DIN'ER

Washington High, Cedar Rapids,
Winner Last Year Will
Not Enter.

Over ion athletes, the representa»
lll'es of 21 schools, will compete Sat.—
urday alter-noon at 1:30, in the twen—
tieth annual Gi'ilinell Interscholastic
Track and Field Meet orr ward iield.
Tire I-lonor G club, sponsor of the
or it, has intimated that the last
arrangements have been completed as
far as the business and is concerned,
and hopes for lair weather are all
that remain to make the meet a suc—
ccss.

Noticc was received at the last
moment from Washington High school,
Cedar Rapids, that that institution
would not enter a team this spring.
\\‘z\shingtun high, coached by Paulo.
former Maltese sprinter, winner of
the meet last year, has planned to en-
ter an invitational meet
Saturday, and are giving the river-
town meet the preference because of
the hotter transportation facilities.
This means that the traveling trophy,
won last year by Washington high tor
the ﬁrst time, will not be defended.

East May chp Cup
Tire rnnnerarp for the event last
spring, East High, Des Moines, is en-
tering a strong team again this year.
and have high hopes of taking the
trophy home for good, East already
having two legs on the cup.
The entry list for this year already
exceeds the list for last season by
over eighty men. Although some at
the stellar lights in meets or the last
two years will he missing, there are
new performers who will no doubt
perform as brilliantly as those in the
past. The recordslist of the meet
looks more lrke tse record list of a
college conference than a high school
affair, many-of the marks being fast-
er than local home meet records.
There are none which seem in any
real danger of falling, but unherald-
ed performers are in the habit oi
bobbing up in unexpected places, and
this may be the case on Saturday.

Sieliert Should Plucc

Among the dashrnen who are exA
pected to land high in the placings
arc Seibert, Roosevelt, Des Moines.
who was the winner of the special
100'ynrd dash event for Des Monies
high schools at the Drake relays last
week. Seibert ran a very nice race to
crowd out several other men in a
blanket finish. Commack, Newton
high school star on both the gridiron
and court, will run for the second
time in a Gi'iiinell meet. Last season
Commack placed in both the lot) and
220mm dashes, and is counted on
to do equally well this season, if not
hctter,

Bitii‘l}, who ran at Greenfield last
year under Mike Augustine, followed
his high school mentor to East High,
and has been turning in some nice
times in the SSD-yni'd run. Baird is
looked upon as a sure winner in the
event, but will find competition in
Hise, Marshalltown midget, who plac-
cd in the event on tho 1926 program.
Hrse also placed in the pole vault in
that meet. ,

Co no May Take lililo

In the mile, Cozilie of University
high school, Iowa City, looms as ' the
probable winner. but there may be
milers among the other entries who
have not been sufficiently taken into
consideration to make any accurate
predictions. Cozino has a mark in the
neighborhood of 4:40.

Kelly, Grinnell, and McLaughlin.
Ames, are looked upon as strong men
in the quarter, each having placed in
the run last spring. Kelly ran on the
Grinnell high school team that placed
third in one section at the mile rc-
lay at Drake, and ran a fine race.
Coach Burgott is looking for his man
to acquire a high place in the event.

Mccriff, Ames is the only hurdler
who competed last year who is back,
and may be counted on to place well
