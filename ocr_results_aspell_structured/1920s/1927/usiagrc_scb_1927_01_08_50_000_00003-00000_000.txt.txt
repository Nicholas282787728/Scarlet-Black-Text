IN ANY group of regular fellows, you’ll ﬁnd
Prince Albert. It belongs. It speaks the lan-
guage. You'get what we mean the minute you
[amp 3 load of this wonderful tobacco into the
bowl of your jimmy-pipe and make ﬁre with
a match.

Cool as a northeast bedroom. \ Sweet as a
note from the Girl of Girls. Fragrant as a wood-
land traii. Prince Albert never bites your tongue
or patches your throat, no matter how fast you
feed it. You’ll smoke pipe-load on pipe-load
with never a regret. '

Buy a tidy red tin of P. A. today. Throw
back the hinged lid and breathe deeply of thaé
real tobacco aroma. Then . . . tuck a neat
wad into the business-end of your jimmy-pipe
and light up. Now you have it . . . that
taste! That’s Prince Albert, Fellows!
