l. MIPS OPINION

What do you think of three hour
examinations?

Prof. I). D. Strollgi‘vls u whole the
papers were better and l dui not hear
as many complaints of exhaustion as
from previous examinations. But I
feel that this statement is based on
few facts."

Frank Dell‘cl‘ﬁlw just used the lull
time once but I was certainly to have
that extra hour then."

-\nll llnllstrong—“I like them. They
uive you more time to think and you
don't (eel so tired out when yuu are
through."

Bill Crouch—“If a person knows
enough to write three hours on an ex.
uminutioll they are too smart to take
exams. l think two hour exams are
long enough.”

Miss )ludcloinc Nichols—“I think
three hours examinations are wonder-
iul. Students who have the idea that
professors are making out three hour
examinations are mistaken for two
hour examinations are enough to
correct. The extia bolll onl: gives
the poor student a chance to think

“Skinny" lir—uhu “I am highly iai
favor or the three hour exams. 1
think any map can write all he knows
in two hours, At that rate it gives
him an hour to loaf. '1 get up early
in the morning so 1 can hove longer
to loaf."

Mury Willimusoll—"I think they’re
splendid. i could write all I know in
two hoursbut it gives one more time
to think."

Elmer Cllllsci'i like them.”

MI. W. ll. Muck—“Because I was}
used to three hour examinations pre—
vious to my arrival here, two hours
examinations seem a tritle short both
from the students and teachers stand.
point."

‘ willuco Winner—“I think they're
all right as long as the exam is only
two hours long."
