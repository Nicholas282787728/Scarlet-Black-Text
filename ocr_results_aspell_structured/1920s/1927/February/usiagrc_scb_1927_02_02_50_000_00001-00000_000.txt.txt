Ask Men for Purpose
Attending University

“\thi is your purpose in the uni-
was the query asked Univer-
sity of Iowa men.

The old belief that young men have
scarccly an idea of what they have
corrrc to a Iulive y for, was blasted
in the Mist majority of cases, Definite
answers were made telling in a few
words the students ambition to her
come lawyers, dentists, doctors, pow.
era in commerce, artists, teachers and
writers.

Iowa men turned in few gencral
answers to the authorities. Somc of
those were “to try to learn how to live
better because they realized the neces-
si v of it;" "Lo learn to think,” and “to
u dell the iicld of vision.” A small
number of men werc hold enough to
register the statement "I don't know."

Whether some of tho students were
having a joke calculated to harass thc
statistics'colleotors of whether they
really meant such answers cannot be
determined. However, one young man
is in. thc university-"to have a good
time and to get good grades,” another
"to r-cccivc social recognition” and a
third was merely curious “to see how
it would be.”

i‘lnle students at the University of
Oi‘egon have succumbed to the charms
of beauty itnd Lire indulging in facials,
marcels, etc.

Time Passe. To Present Play
Felt. l at ColollinL

As

with only two weeks to go, rclrear-
sals for the faculty play, which is to
be given at the Colonial Theatre Feb-
ruary 15, are becoming more frequent
and more strenuous. Everyone is tak—
ing the task very seriously. Mr. Ana
gus gets into his old lady's costume so
as to cavort more convincingly. He
still has a tendency, however, to pull
up his trouser legs when he sits down,
but as a kittcnish, couucttish old la-
dy, he is farcical it not convincing. By
the night of the play he hopes to be
able, in the third act, to smoke one of
Mr. Matlack's cigars without convul-
sions.

In the cast of characters, nrassett
(Mr. Beeler) is listed as a “college
scout." We have Prof. Wood's word
ior it that a scoot at Oxford is not the
butler and valet he may seem on the
stage but rather, a college employee.
who acts in the capacity of janitor and
chambermaid for the students, It be
is sufficiently “fee-ed," that is, if the
tips are generous enough, he may be
induced to perform a‘numbcr of v..
ricd favors. It is not a fat part but
an important one nevertheless.

Mr. L C. Douglass is the young man
whose aunt is responsible for the
complications. If he had not wanted
to see Amy (llIr-s. Post) before She
left for Scotland, to profess his love
for her and propose to her the necess
sity of a chaperon would not have exs
isted. He is fast becoming an experi~
speed and accomplished lover, jealous
of the amorous attentions she Ilzu's to
tho, fake aunt.

The rcal aunt (Miss Boyd) turns out
to he an old sweetheart of Sir Francis
Chcsney (Mr, G. L. Wlttrock), the
gruff but hearty military man. He
will do anything for his son, even prev
poso (for the sakc‘of her money) to a
homely old woman whom he thinks is
the aunt, Mr. Wittrock gives him a
wholly sympathetic interpretation.
