Teamslﬂuachld Are Successful

“Fuzz” Watt, 18, Was Member
of Champion Football Teams
At Gf-hmell.

Lester L. (Fuzz) \Vatt, '18, athletic
director at Roosevelt ngh school, Des
Moines, find [or several years head

conch lit Ar-

gentine high

school, Kall—

Sas Clty, will

be the new

Fioneel‘ grid

mentor, ac

cording to an

nouncement

made by Pre-

sident Main

i-a t e i a s L

V\’ ed. Watt

takes up his

d u t i e s at

Grinnell at the beginning of the fall
gridiron training season.

‘Vatt's coaching record is excep»
tionzll. The seven years he was head
coach at Argentine High School were
marked by successful teams in foot-
bull, basketball and track. His grid
machines fought hard but intelligently
and were usually contenders for the
Kansas pigskin title. His basketball
and track teams were even more out
standing, the iormer being twice hold-
ers of the state championship.

Trained College Stars

A number of college and universit)
stars received their early tutelage un-
der Walt, Peterson, for three years
recognized as the Valley's most tin-
ished basketball player, received his
prep training under the new Pioneer
football head: The Jayhawk is the on-
ly athlete to make the all'conference
team three years. Frazier, another
Jayhaivk and a. small but mighty two-
miier now coached by “Doc" Huff, is
a Watt product.

"Fuzz" Wall's year at Roosevelt
has been the most successful, athletic-
ally, that the school has had. Alr
though forced to pick his team from
inexperienced material, he developed
an undefeated machine which was un-
disputed Des Moines champion, and
has ample claim to the state scholastic
football crown. His basketball team
was scarcely less victorious. It ex?
perienced its only de'feat in the finals
of the Des Moines sectional tourna-
ment. The conqueror Was North
high, a sister school.

Former Grinncil Athlete

The successor of Mike Hyland is a
former Grinneli athlete. Although he
Won letters in basketball, track and
baseball, his finest record was in
football Where he barked signals for
the famous teams of '15, ’15, and '17.
The first and last mentioned won
state championships. The grid~\Var-
riors of '17 were the last to defeat the
University of Iowa, In ’15, “Fuzz”wl\s
second all-conference quarterback and
in '17 he was both the allrconference
and allrstate selection for signal call-
er.

It is interesting to note that one of
the two pigskin defeats administered
to Grinnell during his sojourn there
was given by a team from Carleton on
which Director Truesdale played.

Watt, as successor to Mike Hyiand,
faces a difficult task, With only three
lettermen for a nucleus, he must cre-
ate a team from new material, which
will be strong enough to face a
schedule that is one of the hardest
the Pioneers have ever carded.

Appointment Completes smii

This appointment completes a
coaching smff which should remain
intact for several years. John C.
Truesdaie will act as head of the De
partment of Athletics and as basket
ball coach; Watt, who is given the
title of associate professor of physi-
cal education, will be the football
mentor; G, Lester Duke and T. B.
Turner will continue their duties as
track coach and swimming head re-
spectively. The program of physical
education formulated by Frank L.
Hayes, departing athletic director,
will be continued by the new staff.

Freshmen, Seniors

Doped As Winners

New Records May Be Set In Shot
And Discus With Rinefort
Heaving Beth.

A fine, warm day, and n fairi ~ 'fast
dry- track . eeted the mar teams of
the interciass meet when they took
the field this afternoon. The heavy
rains of the last few days left the
track in a fairly muddy state vested
day, but the sun and wind this morn
ing dried the cinders, and a brief roll-
lqg placed the runway in mid-spring
condition.

The meet this afternoon promised
to be a hard battle for all events. Lit—
tle pronhecying could be done, but
what little was attempted leaned
slightly to the Seniors and Freshmen.
The Seniors will score in several
events that were not held in the in4
door meet, and the Sophomores, wilr
ucrs of the winter event will be han-
dicapped lly tlle addition of several
events in which they are rather weak,

New records will probably be set in
two events, the discus and shot. Capt.
“Mace” Rinefort has been tossing
these implements considerably bee
youd the present records, and with
firm footing, will set up a new stand
ard in each. Practically all of the
other events remain above the Caliber
01 this year's field, and stand little
danger of suffering from a renordr
breaking onslaught such as was the
program for the Home meet two years
ago.

“Bugle Song, “I’m a Wand-
'rin'," And “My Lady Chloe”
Are Outstanding Songs.

lnfell Substitutes Fol Miller

Soloists Complimented; Program
Criticised for Being of

‘ Popular Nature.

5 By ncrnlcc liondelson.

Tlic en's Glee club appeared in
itsltlllrty lilrd quuual home concert
last night ill Herrick chapel.

The program was extremely varied.
perhaps just a trifle too varied, but
the smoothness with which each num-
ber went off, the lack of delay be.
tween them, prevented any tiresome-
ness or restlessness on the part of the
audience,

The most outstandingly well execut-
ed songs by the club were, in our
opinion, Clougb-Leigbtner's "Ma Lady
Chloe," Gaines' “I’m a Wanderin’"
and the Bugle Song by Foote.

Owing to the illness of the cillh
soloist, William Miller, a very able
substitute was provided by James
Illicit. Jerome Hughes further dem—
onstrated his dramatic ability in his
readings. Perhaps the most novel
selection was a guitar solo by Louis
Crowder who, we might add, is one or
the best guitar players we have heard.

However, we should never have sus-
pected that Cadman had Written
“Mighty Lalf‘ A Rose," as we have al-
ways been under the delusion that it
was a composition of Etheibert Nevin.
At least, he has always taken the
credit for it. John Speuccr lived up
to ills reputation as a 'cellist in his
two very excellently played solos.
Loren Adair also displayed his customr
dry brilliance in the Chopin “Polar
liaise."

The quartet might have displayed
themselves to better advantage if the
songs they Sam; had been of a less
popular nature. In fact, we have this
general criticism to make of the em
tire program that with an exception
or two it tended too much toward the
“popular."

Lantern Plans to
Credit Activities

Discussion on the new pomt sys-
tern, limiting the number of activities
in which one man might gain prom-
inence, featured the Lantern meeting
held at 7 o’clock last Wednesday eve-

The proposed system provides for
the crediting of men achieving mp
pcrlaui positions in extra curricular
organizations willl a certain number
of points. After a fixed quota has
been reached be is ineligible for fur
thel' honors.

A committee to investigate into the
oracticabiilty of this proposed innova-
cion will be appointed soon, announce
ed George Dotting, president of the
Lantern.

Corinne Jensen and Elizabeth Hol-
loulnu, went to Underwood, Iowa to
spend Easter.

Harvard Debaters Have Srength
Of Two Years Argument
On Same Topic.

Perry Will Preside Al Debale

NO. 49.

Audience To Vote On Merits 0!
Speaking Rather Than
011 Question.

When the affirmative team from
Harvard university meets the Grinneil
negath e tealll on the question. Resolv-
ed, that education is the curse of the
age, in Herrick chapel Monday night
at eight o’clock, the audience may ex-
[lect one of the best debates held in
Grinueii [his rear, according to 'de-
balmg authorities. Dr. Ralph Barton
Ferry, professor of philosophy at Her-
vard, will ncl as chairman.

The Harvard team, composed of
Frederick W. Lorenzen, Dwight W,
Chapman and Earrctt Williams, will
have the strength that two years of
successful debating in the Eastern
League on this same question will in—
evltabiy give them.

Ilnrrnrll Tolls Lcaguc

Harvard has ranked at the top of
the Eastern Lecguc, composed of
Dartmouth, Amherst, Princeton, Yale,
Wesleyan and Brown, for the last two
years and the Lorenzcn-cuapmamwu-
liams trio have met dcteat only at the
bands of Cambridge in that same time.
All the Harvard nlen are members of
Delta Sigma Rho, national honorary
debating fraternity. Their different
types of speaking, Lorenlen's humor,
Chapman‘s irany and William‘s con-
versationai argument, promise variety
as Well as strong debating from the
visiting team.

This is the third year that Grinneil
has closed the season with a big 19a-
ture discussion-debate against a team
of internationally admitted caliber.
Two years ago Oxford met a decisive
defeat by audience decision to the Pin-
neers. A year ago Cambridge revers-
ed the tables and won from the Grin-
neli orators. Now comes a well—bal—
:mced Harvard team who have to go
against them an equally well-balanced
trio, Mack Smigert, Laurence Lon-
don and Loren Reid from the Grin-
neli team. In the Pioneer's only de-
nision debate this year, the Nebraska-
Grinnell clash, Lunden's and Reid's
side both won audience decisions. All
three mcn are members of Grinnell
Forensic, occupying on the Grinnell
campus an analogous position to that
of Delta sigma Rho at Harvard.

A formal dinner will be given Mon-
day night in honor of the Harvard
team. Guests at the dinner will in-
cludc the Grinneii debaters, Dr. and

At the close of the debate an open

the respeclivc teams rather than on
