Report has it that Grinnell will have
on her hands at Homecoming at large
number of prodigal sons, to say noth-
ing of daughters. Our Suggestion is

The first year students should find
much to make their hearts beat with
pride in the statement of Mr. "Fuzz"
Phipps that the class ot1931 is one oi
the best freshman classes of which ﬁt:
has ever been a member.

Since it has been definitely decided
that the faculty of a certain high
school will not have a representative
at Grinnell's Homecoming, we have
heard “Chuck" Leonard mournfully
whistling that old tune, “0h, How I
Wish Again That I Was In Michigan."

ANNUUNUE TUNE IN
lNlHAMUHAL DEBATE

That Governor Al Smith Be Next
Presidential Nominee, Is
Debate Question,

“Resolved, that Governor Alfred E.
Smith be like next presidem
tial nominee” will be the tonic argued
in the Merrill intramural debate sol»
ies, announced the cxccutive commit
tec nr the Grinnell forensic society at
a special meeting held Monday to de-
cide the question for interdorm dis-
cussion.

The coaching at each building team
lly a varsity debater of that building
is the only change in the method of
conducting the Merrill debates for
this year. Building teams will be se-
lected by committees composed of Fu-
rensic society and \arsity debate men
of the respective dormitories. All the
teams will meet in the preliminaries,
Two of the three preliminary winners
will face each other in the semi—finals,
while the team drawing a bye will ens
counter the semi-rinhls winner in the
finals. pairings will be announced the
latter part of the week.

To AWﬂl'il Prizes.

A plaque worth twenty dollars with
the names or the members a! the win.
ning team engraved upon it will be
awarded to the building mklng first
place. In addition. the ﬁrst three
buildings will receive money prizes or
twenty dollars, ten dollars and ten dole
lars, respectively.

Until 1925, the Merrill prizes were
contested for by the four Grinnell lit-
erary societies, Chrestomathia, Ionian,
institute and Forum. However, with
the abolition of these societies the
prizes were offered to the winning
buildings. Since 1925 the debates
have been conducted by Grilme'll For»
ensic. _

In 1325, Emerson Schlll and John
Pierson representing Building Four,
won first prize, and in 1926 the Smith
hall team, composed of Elliot Wood—
ruff and Graydon lcecton won the ser~
les.
