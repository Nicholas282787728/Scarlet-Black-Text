GER‘IANY LIKES AMERIC .

A few members of the American Legion who have
been making a second A. E. F. expedition to Europe
these past days have been doing”a little serious recon-
nnitering in post-war France and Germany. Many of
the returning veterans evidently have wanted to show
the natne Parlsians, just as the average American tour»
ist does, what good fellows they can he when they get
out from under home restraints.

Mini—ice Cnhb, '29

Frank Miles, editor of the 'ID\V2l Legionaire, has made
a number of intimate and interesting observations in the
Des Moines Register which Show the trend of Ger-
many's reaction to the war, and especially of their re»
action to America’s part in the Conflict. According to
him, there is no hard feeling harbored against the
United States as a‘result of her participation on the
side of the Allies, although there is at distinct ieeling
against France and some' of the other countries. Ger-

mans who still hear life-long souvenirs of the Big Pa-
l'adeia bit of shrapnel in one, a void where once ivas
an arm or leg in ltnutlleriand inflicted by Americans, at
that, can still say they are eager to do everything possie
blc to restore ainity between thci nation and ours,

The big test of Germany's friendship for the United
States will come when payments under the Dawes re-
parations plan are due. Many of the students of con—
ditions in the new Germany are gravely doubtful if this
eXitction will be safe for Gei‘nlaneAlnerican harmony. It
seems to most Germans, of course, that the demand for
payment or the war debt is very exorbitant, when 55
per cent of all tithes go for that purpose.

All exceedingly pessimistic note is sounded by a sig
nificant statement in the very last paragraph. The wri-
tci admits that all Germans with whom he talked keenly
desire permanent peace but are practically certain that
more “ai- is inevitable. Much as they hope for a tribue
iial of international peace, they are too close to the hot-
bed of unrest immediately south of their nation to be-
lieve that it is possible tO—eliminate warfare forever.

Many there are in this country who are of this same
olllliionipl‘obflllly they form the largest proportion of
those who have any thought on the matter. It is evi-
dent that only through aspiration can we reach an ideal
and it is only through continued discussion that perma-
nent peace will come.

ONLY ONE THING MATTERS.

After the disastrous defeat at the hands of Coach
Eedrg‘s Nebraska last Saturday it seems that Grin»
ncll's ioothall sp it is at a low ebh. To examine the
matter closely, however, is to find several circumstances
which make it not at all disappointing that the Scarlet
and Black was at the small end of the score. We are
not ma‘ ng excuses. but frankly stating facts. coach
Watt’s task of developing a team that could make a hid
for national honors (for it would certainly he in champ—
ionship running it it won in succession from Nebraska,
Wisconsin, Marquette, Kansas and Ames) was a job that
could only be accomplished by a super-man, and one
who had unlimited all-American material to work with
at that. Almost every condition necessary for a winning
team has been absent,

. What is of more importance than conducting a post-
mortem over what has already happened is to look at
the game inmiedatel, at hand. Grinnell will kick otf to
Drake against heavy odds. There is inst a slim chance
that Grillliell may upset the dopefbut a chance, how-
ever slight, One thing Griimell demands of its teamsi
that, pin or lose, they fightiiigllt perhaps with bare
hands to stem at storming torrent, hut fighting the battle
of the Pioneer. There is no doubt that thus far they have
done just tllatiit remains for us to show a thi-onging
Homecoming crowd that all Grinnell tights.

Both "Skinny" Evalin and Captain
Davis displayed much in the way or
punting ability. Evahn is quite as-
curate at placing punts outside near
the goal line, while Davis’ kicks are
very high and give the ends ample
time to be on the receiver when he
catches the ball. It is probable that
both of these men will be called upon
to do some punting‘ Saturday.
