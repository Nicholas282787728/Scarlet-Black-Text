Believes Chinclullas Can be Bred w

(Editor's Not

ducting experiments to
commercially valuable
rabbit, The following are his find-
ings to date),

Can the Mendelian laws of heredity
be put to a practical use in the im-
provement of our domesticated ani-
mals? The answer to this question is
being sought through breeding experi-
ments with the coat color of domesti-
cated rabbits, the fur of which is be-
ing used to a greater and greater err
tent each year, It is thought, that
the rabbit, which has recently become
of increasing economic importance as
an inexpensive source of tur and also
of meat, offers an unusual opportlllir
ity to answer this question.

Fur Imitation 5.

Rabbit pelts are used extensively to
day when processed as imitations of a
great many of the more valuable furs.
A few of them are being used in their
natural color and state. Among these
is the Chinchilla which i a very fair
imitation of the Chinchilla lanigera, a
one time extremely valuable fur but

! (EDITOR'S NOTE: This article is
one of a group now appearing in the
Cosmos, student paper at Coo college,
1on the question of compulsory chapel
service. Inasmuch as Grinncll's Vol»
untai service receives special consid-
eration, the articlc is being reprinted),

m the seven collages which answcr-
cd that their-chapel services were void
my. perhaps the most interesting
lflnswcrs were received from Grillucll
college and Dartmouth college. Tliesc
two institutions, considercd by many
to be the lcading liberal arts colleges
ot the United States, were heal-til in
favor of the plan which lays empba s
on the students' desiro to attend the
chapel services.

Dill-tnlollﬂl Ilcplics

The answer received from Dartr
mouth was written by the director or
the chapel. Whether this individual is
a student, orone of the college author-
ities, was not divulged in the question-
a e. The chapel services at Dart-
mouth are held on five weekdays and
on Sunday. The length of the ser-
vices ls practically the some as at Goa.
twenty minutes. The college hears the
entirecxpense of the services, and
special speakers for Sunday are paid
from 350 to $100 for their services.

The chapel system in vogue at Dart-
mouth has received the entire ap-
broval of the student body. and from
the questionnaire received it was
learned that the services are well at»
tended. Nearly 50 per cent of the
daily services ‘a’rc taken up with some
form of music. The individual who
answered the questions stated that the
serviceswerc religious in character

cause none of them are permitted of
export from Peru or Chile which is
their native habitat.

\ Tllc Chinchilla rabbit Wits introduce
ed from Europe during the World war
and little is known of its exact origin.
it differs in color from the cottoutail
of Iowa only in the color of the band
found on each hair. In the cotton»
tail this band is a. brownish red While
in the chinchilla it is pure white. The
same difference is to be found be-
tween our native gray squirrel Com-
mon to the fur trade. This non el-
law difference probably arose as a
mutation but the Chinchilla as a breed
probably has arisen by crossing with
a number 0! breeds of rabbits which
has resulted in a breed of animals
which is far from being true breedinz

.tltcmpts Cross

The original aim of the experiment
Was an attempt at the production of It
Giant Chinchilla through the crossing
of the Chinchilla which commonly
Weighs about six Hounds with a Black
Flemish Giant which attains often a
weight of 15-18 bounds. Theoretically
in the second generation a certain
proportion of Chinchilla should segr
rcgate out many of which would all-
preach the Weight of the Flemish
grandparent. Likewise a new variety
resulting from n recombination of that
color characteristic of (be two hrceds
should result.

To date a few Chinchillas have been
secured weighing as higll as 12 pounds
when adult. One of these is of the
new Variety which has been called A
steel Chinchilla. It is a rich steel
gray in color much darker than me
Chinchilla and for that reason may be
more desirable than the litter,

segregating from these crossbreds
have occurred mt‘tlly off-colored V

This 'de variety has led to a. closer
study of the genetic constitution of
one of the purebrefls, namely the
Chinchilla. Some of the variations oc-
curing in this breed are found and
there is some evidence which irltli»
cates that further study Will bring the
others into the same relationship,

By carefully controlled matings the
mode of inheritance is being determine
ed and measures are being taken to
eliminate undesired characters and so
produce a true breeding Strain. As

Flemish and other breeds will be studs

college. Services are held over dal’
cxccpt Saturday- and are twenty min-
uutes in duration. The president of the
student council at Grinnell was very
emphatic in his statement that the
voluntary seriiccs nerd successful
Faculty speakers frequently address
the students on topics of interest. in
answer to the question of the students'
attitude toward the services, the Grin-
ilell nian stated that the student body
realized the worth of the chapcl ser-
vices and attended very well, While
the entire student body was not prcs~
cut at every service, he felt that those
who attended camc'bcoause they wish-
ed to, and that the atmosphere of the
services was or a kind that could never
be secured under any other system.

The services at Grinnell are not as
sentially religious in character but
topics of interest to the students are
discussed. Only about three or four
minutes is devoted to music. Student
forums are frequently held with great
success,
