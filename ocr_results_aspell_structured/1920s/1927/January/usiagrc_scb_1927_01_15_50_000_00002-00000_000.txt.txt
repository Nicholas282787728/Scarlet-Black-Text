need for more cottage spirit and companionship.

Not only do groups of girls in each cottage tom
cliliues to tile exclusion or others, but: between the girls
of different cottages there is little friendship. Through
iriteiuclass athletics and aliairs such as the Dlllllbrbell Ball
and the Colonial null, the W. A. A. board does its share.
More acthities of the nature of the successiul Snow Ball
of last year are needed to mix the girls of the different
cottages

not properly designed to supply the social need.

PROPOSED BACII'I'ILORS‘ CLI'B.

News has just reached the Scarlet and Black oiiice
of a proposed Bachelors Club among a group of Grinnell
men. ~

The avowed purpose or the club will he to stag rec .

hours and varsities, it has been stated. The other iellow
is to be given the worry and bother oi ﬁshing for a date,
escorting the lady to the dance, and buying the "Candy"
land" alter-wards; members of the Bachelors Club will
attend the dance, cut-in when they choose—in short, have
a glorious evening at the other fellow's expense.

Perhaps no more need he‘ said. By consent or the
majority oi deters, stag dances have been institumd at all
college iornrals. Should the evil or a Bachelors Club
he carried the ia'r, privileges will be withdrawn. A word
to the wise is sum ient.

Notahat the Scarlet and Black disapproves of stag
dances—they form one or the democratic inﬂuences oi the.
Grinnell campus, But men. and propose a Bachelors Club
may well consider that the ultimate client of their club
may he the withdrawal of stag dance privileges.

FOR THE GIRL. p 9

That the social status oil the girls at the Quadrangle is
not all that could he desired, has hccn the subject or many
conversations among the men n: the Halls.

Acoustomed to know where every man in their nar-
ticulhr building livesand something or each fellow's hopes

on attending a cottage open house. to ﬁnd his conduetress

the girl who occupies a ccrtsin rborn. There is evident

OUR GLASS CASTLE.

Now it” our great, good, and omniscient secretary or

There ure more American lives and property in (lane

the rival gangs of hootleggers have more machine guns
and are quicker on the trigger than are the rival factions
in Nicaragua, In Cicero, laws are being violated daily.
They are American laws, not Nicaraguan laws, and as
such this ought to give the secretary of state more con-
cern.

The people 01. Cicero have bad self government longer
than hn\e the people of Nicaragua, and yet they appear
even more incompetent to govern themselves.

Illinois is in a turmoil. Its United States senator»

of Nicaragua was put into office by cash furnished

Now it Diaz is maintained in office against the ob-

why not send a couple of regiments oi devil—dogs, under
General LaJuhe, down to the senate to help Frank L
Smith maintain his seat there?

It has long been the fanciful illusion at those \llia‘

have never tried it, that working one s way through col-
ege is a most excellent discipline, a builder of character,
and the means to an appreciation of educational values.

Now it is at last becoming recognized liy the educational‘

fundamentalists that such is not the case, that John
Jones who earns ever) cent or his expenses is not the
ideal student, but a martyr that the hours he puts in
washing windows cleaning furnaces or clerklng in a
store, could far better be Spent in study or recreation
Leisure is no longer thought at as something to be avoid»

ed if the student would discipline himself [or the rigors'

or after life.

Especially encouraging is the step taken by Paleopitus
student government of Daltmouth, in llleetill" this Dr
lem. A sum of $10 000 has been set upon for it Scholar»
ship fund to furnish loans to worthy- students. Our onn
University has such funds available. It will not he very
long before they will be available in neally evel‘y collegé
ill the country. These efforts should be eilcouiagetl.
Philosophy. rhetoric and physics do not go well with

should be free to enjoy the leisure of their school lite
