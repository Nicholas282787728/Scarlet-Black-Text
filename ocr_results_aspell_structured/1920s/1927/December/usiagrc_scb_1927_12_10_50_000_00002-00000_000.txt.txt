MORE ABOUT SENIOR CUTS.

The SCARLET AND BLACK recommends that all‘
seniors be allowed the option of attending classes. begin.
ning with the second semester.

In suggesting this move we do not mean that the
upperciassmsn shall forsake all classes, but rather that
they be given the opportunity to out without being threat-
ened w h a resulting loss of an hour's credit. The res»
ponsibrllty of a senior is such that the total class attenr
dance would not be lnzlterlilily decreased.

It is taken (or granted that a senior is a busy person.
Most of the executive work of student activities falls on
his shoulders, whether he especially desires it or llot. in

the administration of his duties. tlrcrc arc times when it
is imperative that he cut his regular classes. At. such
times he is generally doing something lor the honefit oi
the college, which should he an added reason for aban-
donrug enforced attendance.

The plan has gone into eliect at Parsons college and
the president announcm] that classes were going on "as
usual." There the seniors are not releasing their prir
vrlcgc and we have no reason to bclicvc that they would
d0 50 here.

We would like to see this matter seriously considered
without re. ting to a petition. which means nothing.

ANOTHER TELEI‘I‘IONI‘L
Perhaps it is a small matter. but there is a sign on the
library telephone saying. “This phone is for the use or
the faculty and the library staff only." Consequently, un»
less a student uses the phone ill some facility menlhcr's
office. he must go back to the dormitories or quadrangle
to send out a message. This is decidedly inconvenient.
The library staif is not to be blamed for prohibiting
the use of its phone; it has just gounds lor doing so. But
what should be done is the esmblishment oi a booth or
at least the placing of a phone in the reading room be»
tween the A. R. H. and the library in order that students
may phone from tlleseéwo buildings. The phone could be
connected with the [acuity line and used for outgoing
culls only, which would make the cost of its installation
negligible.

ll.\IlIOC\S'l'ING CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURE.
There is considerable agitation that the experiment

. iu radiocasting the procedure of the House of Represen-

tatives at the opening or the Sixty- inth congress be con—
tinued in the Seventieth. The experiment was not very
successful the ﬁrst time it was tried but it is thought
that a system can be worked out now whereby all speecllr
as can be broadcast to the public.

Such an innovation would mean a radical change in
the procedure of the House. Members generally rise from
their seats and debate is limited to two or three minutes
Some method would have to be devised to allow all
speeches to go out on the air without too much confusion
in the legislative body itself.

The plan might also be tried in the Senate. where dc.
hate is decidedly not limited to two or three minutcs. The
people would be given an opportunity to hear just what
nonsense their own Representatives and Senators wcrc
proposing in order to take no time. The blustcring Coll—

men would have to act more ludiciously and spealr
' c it their constituency were listening in. There

would he less of printed speeches and more of efficient
action and legislation if such an experiment could he sue

Stillwater, Okl , Dec. 9 (Special)7

Official basketball practice by the Oltr

started in earnest in preparation for
for the first game with Gl'innell. De-
cember 16.

Six of last year’s lettel‘men are back

eleven members of the freshman squad
who received numerals. Other mem-
bers of the squad last season are ex-
pected to furnish keen competition for
the various places on the team.

Gordon Peery, star of the 1926-1927
team, will be missed from the lineup

Twelve o’Clgck Hours

It has not been possible to settle the
question of twelve o'clock hours for
house parties in time to make any
changes in the hours for the parties at
this week. The matter must he voted
upon by all the women. then by the
League board, and finally by the fac-
ulty.

The matter of changing 10:20 Sat-
urday classes to 10:00 will be dis-
cussed at the Student Council meeting
next Sunday.

A Sunposedly Nice
Young Lady Bathes
In Freezing Water

If you received eighty thousand dolr
lars would you ride from Grinnell to
Des lliollaes in an open car in a wet
bathing suit in zero weather? As yet
no one has responded to this munlfia
cent offer or suggestion which was re-
cently made: one reason as to the pull»
city of responses is no doubt due to
the fact that there is some serious
question as to the exact and specific

nerirnent on one’ or the recent cold
winter nights. Due to the inclement
weather, a certain portion of the quad—
rangle running w'ater system very
suddenly decided to emulate Jupiter
Pluvlus. The s. n. y. lady found her-
self indulging in an unexpected and at
that particular time a most unwelcome
shower bath. .
To add to the general injury. the!
impartial broken water pipe was not.
content with directing its sole atten
tion to the young lady in question. but
with very catholic taste it proceeded to
thoroughly wash out every other arti-.
cle in the room. The young person
has not yet decided as to the exact
purpose or this message of Providence.‘
but if this afore~menlioned Providence‘
wished to cast any reflections on thcl
state of that young lady's room. she
wishes to state that hereafter she deai
sires Providence to deliver hel- com-
munications at some other hour than

But woe to the couple that did at—
qtcmpt such a thingl It meant a brain
‘en rule to report to the board of
Discipline. which issued to each stu-
dent a copy of the regulations regard—
ing his right and mum] conduct and
iwlllcll expected any infringement on
‘vthe rules to be reported by the indi
ual rimming them. There were rules
for study. rules for church and cilanel
attendance, rules against a girl de-
grading her sweet young womanhood
by winking at an enthralled young
man or by accidentally showing a
shapely ankle.

Eut contrary to all ethics of pure
womanhood and stalwart manhood.
each sex insisted on knowing that
there was another and there are eases
un record where a boy and girl dated
without the sanction of the Most Holy
Faculty Board or Discipline! There
is even one case of a strident failing to
report that he had neglected to bmsh
his teeth before attending church. Othr
erwise, of course, all students col-l-
scientiously told the faculty everything
they had done.

In 1834. a young Bolshevist. togeth—
er with several other "Rcds' so bitterly
attacked this system of keeping boys
and girls separated and the idea of
"self—taming" that the intelligentsia
behind the desk about-faced. Ever
since then Gl'inneli has been tolerant
of coeeducation “as is Co-edllcation."
Perhaps the reason is that that first
Bolshevlst, H. W. Norris. has been for
a good many years professor of
zoology in Grinnell college.

of exchanging 50 guests for Sunday

0f Ineffectuals and
Snobs, Says Steiner

Dr. Edward A. stcincr. professor of
applied Christianity here startled the
foreign language information service
members at a dinner in New York
Thursday when he declared American
colleges are exhibit A as breeders of
snobs and ineffectuals.

“Education has proved ineffective,"
Dr. Steiner stated. “It has intensified
class-consciousness it has made
young men and women snohbish who
have nothing to be snohhish about. Tire
college campus is full of prejudices.

"In most cities the ilniversity_clilb
is as democratic and socially effect-
ive as the union league club would be
married to the colonial ﬂames. Educae
tion has given information, but little
illumination. It has lurnisl'lcd power.
but no light.

versities chiefly to break down sales

value of slogans which make thinking
