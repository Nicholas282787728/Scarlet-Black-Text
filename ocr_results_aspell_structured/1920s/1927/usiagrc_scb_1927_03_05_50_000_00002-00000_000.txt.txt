. The questionaire recenily circulated by the Scarlet
and Black was to obtain, as it stated, on actual concensus
or opinion regarding cribbing rather than to tlaunt
startling headlines. it was independent of the toolilty
and no names were wanted 01: required from the stu-
dents. The situation iii Grlnllell is no worse than in othe:
colleges and universities. However-,‘the results ol the
poll (printed on page one) rcvenl some statistics startling
to the students themselves as well as the raculty.

The 330 replies to the questiouaires probably repl'u~
sent the conservative element at Grinnell's student body.
{or those who did reply are indicated to be the more coll~
scientious lot. There are nearly 800 students in Grinnell'
half answ-ciod the poll, therefore if this reasoning is not
tenacious, the results' are conservatively representative
of the attitude in! Grillnell students.

Here are a few interesting facts the returns indicate:

The whole matter of cribbing'scenls to center about
the word “justify." What do theseﬁﬂeen students mean
by the term? Apparently they mean this: that they sit
in an examination and see others around them asking

This is a tail-y talc.

Long ago there’ lived a man who continually asked
que tions to make people think he was wise. One would
say today that he had any interrogative cumplex. His
que tions were sometimes poignant, hilt that was all. He
nev r reduced the resulting inlormation into concrete
knowledge or opinion by weighing and sitting the ans
swers. Ho merely assented with a comprehensive .“uli
hull" and walked away—to as]: more questions. He
tooled his superiors and his equals for some time, but
one day he turned into the question mark one -tinols in
all printing. ‘People raised their voices in contempt when
they allproachcd him.

This is not a rail-y tale,

. To spoil it allil'ight now there are students in Grin-
nell and every other college and university who wander,
, about in on intellectual daze. attempting to tool the pubs
lic by continually asking questions. To interrogate with
the sincere purpose of obtaining intorlnation is well
enough, but to attempt to play the politician heloi-c one is
able to vote is had indeed. Perhaps such persons harbor
the secret aspiration of becoming one or these “pointers
with pride," but they assuredly have no designs upon the
position or ulle whose judgment is respected. i

Question marks of this sort are always to be round in
college among those who lovingly dash up to the instruc-
tor's desk and say, "Now do you really think this true.

half an hour emphasizing that particular point,
