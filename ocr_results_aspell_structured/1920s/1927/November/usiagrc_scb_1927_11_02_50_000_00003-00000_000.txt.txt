UH Siliurtlil) iiiglitsl

Lois w $01171 think it's a good idea
because it gets the girls used to stay—
ing up on Saturday night.

Lois l’ascoo—I ﬂDDi‘OVC of it.

Iliu'olll CoIlleriiI think 11:30 hours
on Saturday are good, hut I suppose
the 10:30 hours on Friday are a ne-
cessary evil.

Mar ct Napier—It's a Very good
idea, hecause on Friday night there
are very iew social activities, and they
make it possible to dance and enjoy
the varsities on Saturday, ,

Don FessleriI think it’s a good
idea. You can have a good time on
one night of the week, anyway.

Jlilui Whiting—I like the idea. only
I think men should he allowed in all
cottage parlors from 11:00 until 1 0.

Loriiirln Stank—l ditto anything my
roommate says. /

Frulili Hlirlhlit—You should connect
them up with day-light savings,

Barbara Allen _ Ten-thirty hours
don’t seem any different than week
nights, and unless there is something

unusual to do, I think the 11:30 hour A

is a waste of Linie.
