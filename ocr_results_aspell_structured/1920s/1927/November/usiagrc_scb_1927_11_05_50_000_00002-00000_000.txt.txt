“ lL\T DO YOU THINK?

Truth and idealism are constantly held before the
Grinneil student, “Challenge the world'” he is told as
the virtues of a mart in the cause or right are pointed
out to him.

This newspaper is free from cen rship andhas always
enjo, d the pr' ' ego or printing, \ thin the bounds oi
propriety, just what is thought. It is characteristic or
Grinnell; protessors, lecturers and itinerant speakers are

allowed to say what they please hereithe student is left

to form his own opinion, it is not tidied out to him. We

Students have complained that the Tanager i crowds
in; out undergraduate material in printing articles by
Writers with "big" names. They seem to think that it is
futile to attempt to get anything printed in the magazine
because (if this competition.

The fact is that the Tanager welcomes student coir
tribulions; it gives them preference when manuscripts
are Voted uni Tile reason that law Student. articles have
been printed is that very law are being submitted by
students, The magazine cannot print what it does not
have The proportion of outside contributions turned
down in comparison to those of students not accepted is
Very great,

After all, the Tanager is it literary magazine and should
judge what it prints on the merit of the articles. It is a
compliment to the student to have his Writings included
in the same magazine with those of Lew Sztrett, Gamnliel
Bradford. \Vhitclauv Saunders, Ruth Suekew and others
He should feel honored that fifteen Tanager contributorrs
are included in “Who’s \Vho in America” and five others
included in that work have hiid manuscripts rcjectcdr

Nor ould the magazine print an obviously Sclll|0r
moric article simply because it is by it student, The
Tanager represent Grinnell collage, and thus far has
provcn good publicity'r The Grillnoll Review attained a
national scope. The Midland is it very \l'Drlhy lltllc
magazine and certainly no detriment to the University or
Iml'zt. ’l’llerc is no reasau why the Tallagcr should not
continue to expand and improve and at the smut: time
