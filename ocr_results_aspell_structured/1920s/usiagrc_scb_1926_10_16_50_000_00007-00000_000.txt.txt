Original Ward Field
Dates Back to 1892

It the Griniicll-Aines game today
were to be played on the location used
up till cl y ars ago, the goal pns s
\iould be somewhere tietu-ecu lilaii-
hall and the men's gymnasium, and a
iew perilous camp stools and the nine
dows ot the lihi - would serve as
bleachers, Ward licld was not laid
out until 1892, when increasing inte .
est in athletics warranted a permaiu
eiit. separate arena ier them

The original location of the hold
was inst a little west at where it now
stands The class ol 1593 donated a
stout uooden lenee around itto d
courage all but the cash customers,
and in return thei- were allowed the
priiilcgc ot naming the lield. They
settled upon the present name or ward
ﬁeld in honor at Helbert C, “11rd, a
Grinncit graduate \iho wasithen , ill
in renoun as an athlete and a Sports»
man, and deemed inost worthy oi ha
ing his name permanently linked it ith
Grim-tell atlileticss.

Three years later, in 1895, the iield
was enlarged and moved to its pres
eiit boundaries, A wooden grand-
stand was erected and Charles L1“
son donated the cinder truck, which
was mien banked at :Lhe curl-es ior
tricycle races Many illustrious con-
tests were waged oil ghe field as it
then stood: we read of one meet where
the mile walk was won in less than
eight minutes, and the high klckwent
over eight feet. Here too the early
Pioneer ioothall \\':l.n'iu;rs “with arms
interlocked halted the opponent's
rush" for no gain,

The

classes of 1903 hml 1810 donated $2500
each and the rest or the money was
given by alumni. in 1913 the big
boulder at the entrance ht 'Si’l’it'rd field
was donated by the class of 1893 at
their twentieth reunion. Thus the
class which named the ﬁeld also put
the tint hing touch to Word field as
we know it today.
