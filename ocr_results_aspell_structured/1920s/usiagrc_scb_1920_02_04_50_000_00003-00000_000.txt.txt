SUSPEND JU‘DGl‘mN'l'.
(From the lowa State student)
The' outcome of basketball games
here lately has brought out many crit-
icisms of the player ind the coach by

Istudents who are in no position to

pass judgment. They think they know
just what is wrong with the team and
they condemn the methods and actions
01' those who are putting in their time
and work.

The tendency is to arrive at quick
conclusions and puss hasty judgment
is found all oven We forget that only
those who are in the position to con-
demn should pass judgment. Why is
a justice picked to hear cases? Why
do we not put up any man in the
judge’s seat and say, "If he guilty or
innocent, and what shall his sentence
he?“ Because we know that it takes
men who are trained along these lines
and who are equal to the task to sen-
tence or acquit.

We say a man is "yellow“ because
we have seen him ﬂinch in a football
game or in some other test of physical
prowess. We condemn him. lrnnledle
rarely—we who have not been in his
place and do not know the conditiuns
or anything else about him. The great
war has done much to correct these
errors in our judgment. The young
man that we saw draw hack in the
toothall scrimmage went to France and
won the Croix de Guerre. We see our
mistake and wonder how we ever
could think what we used to about
him. Yet the next day We will make
the samc statement to a frlcnd on the
same amount of evidence.

A man's courage is a big thing to

run down. A Ward said against it
soon develops into a whole paragraph.
1n the eyes of the hearers he becomes
a coward, The next minute he may
have the opportunity lo erase cut the
stain, but what, if the opportunity does
not come?
We must keep on backing the team.
And we should do this without the
criticism that we have made in the
past. We ure nut in the position to
pass judgment and have no right to do
so. If ever the team needs support,
it is now. Real sports hack a losing
team a great deal harder than they
do a winning one.

Don't crab and tell about what you
think is wrong with the team. hack
