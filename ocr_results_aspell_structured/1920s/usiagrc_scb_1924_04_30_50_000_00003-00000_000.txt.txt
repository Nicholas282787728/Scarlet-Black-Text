Go and ﬁnd a longrllitll'etl girl

Let her cheeks be pinned by wind:
(Not by Princess rat or Luror

[Or with any newer brondi)

Let her hands know both the dish-

pan

And the art of kneading brood.

Let her wear no glittering silver
Round about her souoy bend:
clothe her in o long»slee\ ed apron,’
Silk don't let her hosiery he.

Let her never show her nnklo.
Nor her shoulders or her knee.
cost her eyes demure and tender-
Never let her roll her own.

Teoch her not the snappy line

To use upon the telephone.

Let her heart be true lorever

To one Sheik until the end.

You may have that girl, my friend!

‘Violinist Pleases

Unusually Large
Recital Audience

Harvey Waugh gave an excellent
recital in Herrick chapel last evening.

. A large audience had gathered to hear

the young violinist whose playing has
so rncturerl during the last year.
There was a warmth of feeling in his
interpretations; in most of them a
mellow note of melancholy.

Technically lilr. whugh qualifies as
{Ln artist of the first calibre. He plays
with precision and accuracy. His
bowing is quite faultless, and his dou—
ble.siopping beautifully executed.

Most imposing on Ills program was
the de aerint concerto. This he
played with insight as to its harm-on—
ic values. Vieuxtemp's “Air Val-lo”
presented a. host of technical difficult-
ies which for the most part Were well
mastered.

Mrs. Smiley furnished splendid he
coo'tpaninients. Any artist should be
grateful [or her services.

Frank Miller, '21, entertained nt a
dinner party Sunday noon in the Quinl-
rcngle dining room, in honor of his sis—
ter, Helen Miller, of Iowa City. His
guests were: Kathryn McAlistor-, ’23,
Marjorie Tabor, ’26, Illiu'y Belle 'lnhor,
Florence Craver, ‘24, John hchlpine,
’25, Robert Richardson, '27, Wallace
Witnier, '27, ‘and Bernard Craven, ’26.
