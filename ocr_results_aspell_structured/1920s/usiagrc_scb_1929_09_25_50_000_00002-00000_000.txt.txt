SMOKING—A LOGICAL MOVE.

No doubt the outside press will
view the new smoking rule as a
sweeping victory for siniif smoking
is sin, and, no doubt many leagues
for public uplift will denounce Grin-
nell. In reality, the league board
has done nothing more than follow
the lead of most Eastern and Mid—
Western institutions.

Smoking is common on the Smith.
Radclifr, and Columbia campuses.
When old maid school teachers get
together in the summer at Harvard.
each goes out for a between-class
smoke.

Certainly. from a purely biological
stand point, smoking can not he en-
couraged. but, its wide acceptance
forces it not only into Grinnell but
all Mid—West institutions. The rul—
ing must he applauded both by smok-
ers and anti—cigarette leagues, for
it allows girls to smoke who would,
rules or no rules, yet it makes smok-
ing inconvenient enough so that non-

smokers are discouraged

A PLEA FOR RESEARCH.

AS school opens, students are

interested in what. their professors
have learned and how they have
changed during the summer. As the
year progresses. no doubt many of
the newer wrinkles in higher educa—
tion will be introduced.

fields as they should. Though the

the
privileges to unusual students, this

paragraph concerning special
year, as before it has too little gone
beyond the catalog.

It is only reasonable that Crinnell,
with her traditional selection of stu»
dents, should have three or four stu»
dents every year who are worthy of
encouragement in lines of special
reading and research to the extent
that they should be allowed optional
attendance of class.

To some extent the zoology, chem-
istry, and botany departments en-
courage research, but other depart-
ments are too backward. Special re-
search must and is one of the prin-
ciple excuses for

colleges. From

Chicago university to Parsons col»
lege a group of students and profesr
sors are constantly making discover-
ies which may or may not be import—
ant.

Certainly the awarding of special
privileges to the best students is a
step both in research and training
outstanding men and women.

SKILL, COURTESY'S TEE THING.

As the season opens, sports authors
ities not only at Crinnell, but where»
ever football is a topic. concede PiC~
neer football players more than an
even chance to win. As Coach Watt
will explain to anyone, there is still
a chance that the entire team will
get ptomaine poisoning or that half
the squad will break legs, but in gen-
eral, pessimists are having a hard
time.

Of course the SCARLET AND
BLACK. along with alumni, faculty
and students, will be glad if Pioneer
gridders win, and yet it will
take greater interest in what impres«
sion they will leave at other schools.
Will they be considered fighting,
courteous players, well-coached, in»
telligent. Skilled? If they can leave
such an impression, whether they win

or not. they have represented Grin-
nell as it should be.

College Youths Are
Held For Burglary.

“Big" Charlie Parish and Al Capone
Heldridge are the objects or a man-
hunt being lcd by Alex Manson, local
chief of police. When apprehended.
they will be charged with attempted
bank robbery. The evidence is very
circumstantial, but Manson said in an
exclusive interview with Doric, that
there was no doubt but what the boys
were guilty. One of the Doric editors
was, as usual, in the thick of things,
and beat the local fire truck to a ﬁre
at high noon yesterday.

The iirst faces he saw were those
of Parish and Heldridgc. They
were anxiously peering this way
and thnt, mostly that. Suddenly,
as the crowd grew larger, they
leaped into a long, black phaeton,
iaintly resembling a Cadillac. The
car had iour white wire wheels,
lmd was stripped for fast driving
and a quick getaway. (Manson
thinks that the can can be identir
ﬁed by any one of a number of
freshman girls, whoso ﬁnger and
foot prints were found in the back
seat.) The Doric detective smelled
a rat, (sometimes called a Parish.)
and leaped into the Scarlet and
Black's news car.

The chaste, (i. e.. Parish and Held—
ridge) were closely followed by the
chasers, until the Citizen’s National
Bank was reached. The phaeton
drew to a quick stop, and the young
criminals leaped to the curb, to meet
none other than Chief Manson. “Just
as I expected," chortled the chief.
“You tried to draw me from my duty
by turning in a ﬁre alarm, and then
intended to rob the bank while I was
absent, It's of no use. You have
failed to cope with the resourcefulness
