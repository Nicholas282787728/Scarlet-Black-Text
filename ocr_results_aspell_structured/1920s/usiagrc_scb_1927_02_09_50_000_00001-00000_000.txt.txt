The time was, but not now, when
the grave misdemeanor ol peeping . .
to milady's boudoir during the llisl'obr
ing process might have been, in an
iota, cxplilinitble. Those da are
gone loreror; we are now living in an
ago of automobiles, short dresses and
one piece bathing suits. if one felt so
inclined it might be called an era
where the imagination has no part to

However, it is not a question of the
exeusabloness oi the crime that deter-
mines the direction oi the u-md.
Grinnell has a male citizen who peeps,
peers, gates or what you will, into the
windows or a ouadite's boudnir at the
umnentionnble hour. Grinnell also
has a cured who had the ability to outr
smart this “peering Pel' and the
fortitude of keep her equilibrium long
enough to make his capture certain.

GATES LEOTIIHES OWEN
BY BISHOPN’OONNEII

“Social Imagination" and “Voices of
The People" Are Subjects of ‘
.FiriitTwo Lectures.

"The power of social imagination is
the ability to take seriously how
things look to other people, not how
they would look to us if we were the
other person, This will save civiliza-
tion from peril," stated Bishop Franr
cis J. McConnell, Gates lecturer, in his
initial address, ”Social imagination,"
to the members of the Fellowship Colin
{erence and the Student body in Her-

ck chapel Tuesday morning. The
speaker was introduced by Pres. J. H.
T. Main.

Science Protects Mun

“Mankind in groups has never

learned to live without tailing afoul
of one another," continued Bishop
McConnell, "However, civilization
will not suffer for the Whirl: of motel-L
nl thing. It won’t suffer for the lack
of food, science and the modem means
of transportation will not allow that.
Also, science has protected the world
against the plague, Asiatic cholera,
food and water horn disease ; cousea
quently as long as the elements hold
together no material dangers will he-
fall civilization.
I "What civilization needs i, the de
Ii‘elohment of its imaginuti e power
and an application of principles. This
is applicable to international affl ' -s as
[as it is to civic affairs. We have to
Ilearn what other people think and
what they mean, Force is a barrier
to understanding and there is nothing
positive about it "

Must Have Understanding

The speaker continued by illustrat—
ing his point with a number or ex—
lamples, ”A man who comes up out
of the ranks oi the laboring man does
not know the laboring man’s problem.
llie has succeeded and his iellow
workers have not in his estimation.
Consequently he can't appreciate the
man he thinks unsuccessful, it is too
hard tor him to get that point of view.

“We are certainly under Christian
obligation to oiler what we have to
people of other religions," said Bishop
r, McConnell when interviewed to-
tlalv "and if the} want it they can take
it. We can present truth but we
must not force it upon other people."
a 1 McConnell cited the example oi
the Spanish conquests in Mexico and
South America to show the futility oi
such a plan,

When asked about the inter-church
movement the bishop said, “The inter-
church movement was nut. It movement
of union but one of cooperation. It
was a united effort to raise money and
it accomplished its purpose and dis
banded. This movement came too

'somi to have any real success toward a

union.”
Eventful L‘nion

When questioned as to the possibility
oi a union oi all denominations he
said, "I don't see at the present time
any signs oi a definite union. The
Protestants and the Catholics are work-
ins together more and more and will
finally ﬁnd themselves together.”

Speaking 01 fundamentalism and
modernism M McConnell said, "Some-
times I have thought there was a dan-
ger in iundamentalism and modernism.
There was a period a iew years ago
but we are coming to an understand»
mg. I feel the peril is past; the con-
troversy brought up questions which
helped.

”I think on the whole, the debate on
the question, like evolution and the
trial at Dayton. will clear the air and
will provide for a better adiustment
that we havehad."

iv 11 college situations and with the
youth movement in this and other
countl-io. and when asked what he
considered the true situation of col-
icges religiously, he said, “As I go
around among the colleges I ﬁnd the
students asking more earliest and serlr
ous questions than I have ever known
them to ask heiore.

"There is a great search for a pal-7
sollal religion. at trying to get hold of
the best religion and the most practical
relations to it. The hell ﬁre and
damnation of old fashioned religion
has gone. I haven't had a question
about hell asked me by students for
man, vears.”

lt uns quite a relief, when in
response to that age old question, do
you believe the younger generation is
going Lo the clogs, Mr McConnell re-
plied, “The younger generation is not
going to the dogs. There is more earn-
estness among the young people than
before. We see the flapper type but
under that the youug people are at-
tempting to become-adjusted to Wortllr
While things.

Must. Ask Questions

"The worst thing to do when you
hear or something the younger genera-
tion has done is to appear shocked be-
cause this serves only to agitate the
shocker to lurther action. The
noblest contribution youtb can make is
to raise questions. We need to have
some type of persons who shock us by
the typo of inquiries they raise. The
value of a youth movement is that they
ask point blank why this should be.”

Mr. McConnell seemed quite in sym-
pathy with the college students when
he answered emphatically, "No," to a
