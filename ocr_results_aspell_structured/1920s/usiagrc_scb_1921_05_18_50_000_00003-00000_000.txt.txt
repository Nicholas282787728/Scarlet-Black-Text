“Sheltered Daughters," the
Justine Johnstone picture at
the Colonial Thursday and
Friday, in a story or New York
lile, and shows some or the
adventures which come to a
girl who has heenkept closely
confined at home by a too
careful father, and permitted
no knowledge of life save as
she found it in romantic
novels. Naturally enough,
her ignorance of life very
nearly led her into trouble,
and it was only the kindness
of fate and the alertness of
her lover that saved her from
an international scandal.

Ed Andrews cavorted and sang his
way through his ramous role of Ker

from Gilbert and siilliyairs “The Mr
kfldo" for the nth lime belore a large
and enthusiastic audience at the Colo—
nial last Saturday night, Mn lin-
dl'ews has hlayed this part so many
times that lie is not sure of the exact
number hinisell and it was very re-
markable that a man with the reputed
age or seventy tour could show such
agility and retain so much enthusiasm
in a part which would task the crforts
of a man much younger.

It would he an insult to the other
members of the cast to say that Mini
Andrews was the whole show by him-
self, :iltlio it would not be impossible
loi- him; but it happens that he was
not to be the only star of the evening.
Miss Patricia Baker, as Yum-Yum,
was very charming, and possessed a,
good voice. Miss Ann McCashin de-i
lighted the audience with her inter-
pretation of Pitti-Sing. Her dancingl
was exceptionally well received. Mr.
T. L. Alhan, as Nanki-Poo. and M
Duane Nelson, as Poo-Bah, filled their
parts in a very excellent manmicr.

This famous revival of “The Mi-
kado", with its delightful scenic et»
fects, is endearing the most popular
comic opera of the passing genera-
tion to the younger generation. "Tit-
Willow" and “The Flowers that
Bloom in the Spring, Tm la" were
heard again with enthusiasm, Miss
Caroline Andrews, a sister or 'Mr.
Andrews, and member of the one time
famous Andrews Opera company.
