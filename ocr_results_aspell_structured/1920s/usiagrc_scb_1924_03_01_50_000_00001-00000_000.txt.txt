Y. W. HOLDS ITS
SECOND MEETINGS

Group Plan Continues to Anouse
Interest at Quadrangle.

The second ol the group meetings at
the Y. W. C. A. was held Thursday
evening in the drawing room. A short
devotional service, led by Eloise Looms
i, preceded the division into groups
for nlormal discussion,

The discussion oi Christianity in re
lation to world problems was led by
Mrs. Paul ilacEachron and centered
around Christian work that is now
being done in the Orient. Mrs. Mac-
Eachron spoke inlormally of sci-oral
experiences in her work in Techow,
Shantung, china, and then turned the
group illto an open forum. in res-
ponse to a question on the life of the
average Chinese, Mrs. Maenaohron
said, "The big problem of China to
day is economic. she needs economic
experts to help her out of present dit-
ficulties. Missionary enterprise will
never make rapid progress until some
spirit or altruism enters into foreign
capital which is now ruthlessly ex-
ploiting the resources of China."

Enrollment Sinlplil‘icd

'lll'e fixed giade for high school
work has been discontinued, as weli
as the health certificate hitherto re-
qulred, so that enrollment is not quite
so complicated a process as before.

ornalm ls‘ giving Des Moines a close
run in the number at applications for
registration, but among the states out—
sidc of Iowa, Illinois leads Nebraska.
Eastern applications increase in quan-
tity every year New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. are already represented
in the next freshman class, while Cal—
ital-hid, Montana, Colorado, and others
will be among those present, as well
as the near—by states.

An ideal enrollment for Grinncll,
according to Mr. Matlack, would coh—
225
sophomores and zoo freshmen. Al-
though those proportions seem far
from realization at present, neverthe—
lcss there is a decided tendency to;
ward larger junior and senior classes,
the class of 1924 being thelargcst
senior class Grinnell has ever had,
and the first senior class in many
years to contain more men than wom-
en. With an increased emphasis on
the value of a iour years- college
course, and tho tendency of profes—
sional schools to require the E. A. de-
grcc for admission (the engineering
lschools, as well as graduate schools or
llaw and medicine), there will not be
so much dropping of the college
course at the end of the sophomore
year.

Uniror ity Glnnkmr Doomed

The glamour ol the great state insti—
tullons shows some signs of becoming
dimmed. Recent occurrences at Miss
scuri, and the statement of President
Burton of Michigan that jazz, movies
and the automobile threaten to Wreck
the educational values or the univer-
sity, show that the problem of assimb
Ilating cvcry September several thous<
land men and women has ils,serious
lsido, and is one which low of the state
univcrsitics arc equippd to handle, ac—
cordiug to n . Matlaclv', Figures pub-
lished by the Boston Transcript re»
coutlr show that the abnormal expan-
sion in cnrollmont has almost ceased.

nrmncll will welcome good students
up to the limit of its capacity, and the
best way to get good students is
through thosc who are already here,
says Mr. . atlaek. Almost every day
students como into the ofliee with the
names or someone back home who
ought to come to Griuncll, This co~
operation is not only welcome, but is
invaluable.
