Plans Under Way to Have Famous
Pioneer Sprinter Work in
Grinnell Under Huff.

A movement has been started in
Osltaloosa, by friends of Leonard T.
Paulu, '22, famous Pioneer spriut’el‘ for
three successive scasons, to send him
to the Olympics in France this sum.
mer as a member of the American
Olympic team. The movement has
gained headway and, Paula is already
working out at Oskaioosa High School

, where he is an‘ instructor and track
coach.

Panlu will he remembered by Grin-
nell tollcwers as winning both dashes
pat the National Meet two years ago,
and he still holds the meet records
for both races. The famous sprinter
under the tutelage of "Doc" Huff was
a. consistent point winner for the
wearers of the malteaso cross for
three years, and was ranked as one
of the best dash men in‘the country.
A little slower than the best on the
start, he had a tremendous finish, and
could always be corrnted to place as
the first, or among the ti'r-st in every
race, but the 220 was his best bet, and
a race in‘which he was rarely beat-
on.

Mrty Work Out ﬂora

Arrangements are being made to
have Paula come up to Grinuell every
evening in the spring to work out
against the Pioneer track team, since
there is no cinder track at. tho Oska-
loosa High School as yet. Admirals
or Panln here and elsewhere would
be glad to see the iormer Grinnell
track captain cop international honors
at the olyrnpics.

Faculty Club ‘Play To
, Be Given This Evening

The fire has already been lighted
for the "Pot Boiler" and tonight the
faculty talent blossoms out in full

' glory. The insimrlficant sum of fifty
cents will let each and every student
in on an entertainment which includes
the "Toy Symphony,” the "PotrBoiler"
itself and an extra feature during in—
ter—mission. Each one of these would
be cheap at half the price!

We/ourselves intend to be there in
our best bib and tucker. We shall
get a. front row seat and discover for
ourselves what roles Mr. Inkwcll, Mrs.
Pencil and Mr. Ruler can play besides
the everyday job of chief assistants in
a mathematical problem!

Critic Finds Cost Enthusiastic
Over Production —~ Play Is
Powerful Drama.

We wandered into a rehearsal of
“Beyond the Horizon" the other day
and were Surprised to ﬁnd the actors
Well under way in the O’Neill play.
It had transmitted its strange spell to
the cast already. To this play they
giving themselves wholeheart—

morkable.

They were doing a scene [roln the
second act, a thrilling scene that com—
bined hor r and beauty, stl‘entgh and

There was a terrible vividncss, an
awful intensity about the whole Dro-
cceding that reminded us of "The Mir.

us afraid.

were

Such a. rehearsal promises much for
the production of "Beyond the
Horizon." The ubiquitous director- in.
terrupted occasionally; the promptc
gave a cue, familiar behavior in any
rehearsal! But something else was
directing the young actors: it was
that quality of ﬁle drama itself which
was dynamic. under its spell we can
reasonably expect an inspired per-
formance of this tremendous play.

Dope Gives Edge 011 Meet To the

A squad of eight Pioneer track mcnl

Gwen Doped to Place

According to a dope chart in the
Thursday morning Des Moines RegiSv
ter, the Maltease cross will rank third
from the last with only two points to
her credit. Green is expected to will
these two points by taking fourth in
both hurdle races, the fifty yard highs,
and the fifty yard lows. Drake and
Oklahoma are ranked below Grinnellr
with only one marker for the Bulldogs
and none for the Sooners. Missouri
is doped to win with 37 points.

Small Squad

With a small squad of eight, Grim
poll has a slim chance of doing much
heavy scoring, yet the Pioneer cinder
team has some performers that are
capable of upsetting Register dope.
Schai-nwebcr has shown up well in the
sprints and has a splendid chance of
placing in the fifty year-d dash.

The Maltcase cross will be worn in
the mile relay by Porter, Gillette, Pat-
ton and Scharnwelrer. Meyers will
run the two mile race, L. Jones the
fifty yard sprint and Captain Mollratlr
will compete in the hall mile.

Captain Benz finished his last hilt;

day night with a total of 152 points
to his credit. His free throwing 2.1)in
ity has enabled him to lead the field,
and he now has nearly twice the num-
ber of any other man in the confer-
ence, Throughout his college career,
Benz has always been a consistent
scorer, and a dangerous man to his
opponents, and this year he has
been better than over.

Boolter Benzls Rival

Boelter of Drake is Benz’s only
rival, and with one some left to play,
he has 1-10 points. He will have to
make thirteen points in the game
against Amos in order to take the
load, but the Drake team has adoped
the policy of focding Boelter almost
exclusively, in an effort to push him
to the top, so the results of thh
Drake-Amos game tonight will be
watched with great interest by Grin—
uell followers.

Cover For Cyclone

Harry Reynolds, editor of the nineteen

day that a proof of the cover had been
received from the printer. The design
for the cover was submitted by an
exclusive designing company and is
an excellent piece of work, a cover
which will make this year's annual
present one of the host appearances
of auyl of the books of recent Years.
One of the features of the book
will be the section devoted to the win-
ners of the representative contests
held last fall. Eight students, a
man and a women from each class,
were picked by popular vote of the
student body, and their pictures will
appear in the annual. No information
can be secured as to Who the Winners
of the contest are, it being claimed by
Editor Reynolds that even the winners
themselves do not know of the honor
that has been confered upon them.
