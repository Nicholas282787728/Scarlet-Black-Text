Less Successful In Practice Than
It Is In Theory, Declares
Harvard Speaker.

Will Speak Again April 20

Yttrsuit of Ideals Brings More
Than Actual Attainment,
Believes Perry,

“Democracy finds itself not only rc-
sisted. but aggressively attacked in
the new era," said Prof. Ralph Har-
ton Perry. Howard exchange speaker.
in opening his second lecture. " Rea-
sons for Democracy," yesterday morm
ing at long chapel.

Concerning the principle of dimmer
racy, Professor Perry said, “Men have
professed democracy but have never
practiced it, It is not as ‘successful
in practice as in theory. -

"Moral achievements are never se-
cure; especially is this true with us
pact to democracy. The pursuit of
ideals appeals to men more than the
overtaking of them. But one of the
dangers of pursuing an ideal is that
when one comes to close quarters with
it, one has a feeling of revulsion
Ideals are goals too swift for their
pursuers.”

Defines Democracy Belief

Professor Perry spoke of the tech-
nology' of democracy as being the
means of attaining democratic society.
He defined the philosophy of democ-
racy as being the standards them-

, selves, relating to what is right and
wrong.

"Errors in democracy spring from
the philosophy underlying the Declar-
ation of Independence. The eighteenth
century conception of the original
state of man was a false conception.
The eighteenth century idea was that
self-interest makes for a better socie
ety; that justice is independent of
prosperity. The government guaran-
tees liberty, rather than abrogates it.

“All that, is natural is not neces
sarily good.‘ The best Christian is
likely to find the least of Christianity
in the world. The earth left the Cre-
ator some time ago; it has been leav-
ing him ever since. '

‘ Want Virtue Free

"There has always been a demand
for a philosophy which dispenses
with virtue free. The idea that deln~
ocraoy will cost nothing to anyone is
dangerous."

Professor Perry discussed the au-
thority for democracy by saying that
the authority should be with those
who fully realize those things that
should be done.

in closing, he defined democracy as
being, "plural individualism, while
equality means the consideration of
all men as fellow mortals."

Professor n. n. Perry will he in
Grinnell for the next three weeks as
the Harvard exchange lecturer. Pro-
fessor Perry's first lecture was given
last Friday at long chapel. One lec-
ture will be given each week at long
chapel, the last of the series being
scheduled for May 6. He will also
speak to Dr. J. D. Stoops' classes in
philosophy.

Professor Perryvis a graduate of
Princeton, and has his degree of Doc-
tor of Philosophy from Harvard. He
was instructor in philosophy in Wilv
llams college and in Smith college for
several years, but has now been a
professor atimrvnrd for many years.
He was the Hyde lecturer in the
French university in 1921.

His next lecture will be at
chapel Wednesday, April 20.

For Stiffest Schedule In
History.

With the advent of favorable spring
weather, the Pioneer tennis team exs
nects to take to the held about the
nil-st of next week. The courts are

strenuous usage, as fast as compe-
tition is concerned, that\tbey have

Led by strnble, Stotts, Smiley and
Lovejoy. lettermen from last year's
winning team, a fair Sized sound of
seasoned performers will nght' for
places on this spring's Grinnell
racquet team. Prominent among the
newcomers will he Harris Coggeshall,
state champion of both Iowa and Ne
braska, and who with Stotts, holds the
Iowa state doubles title. With the
loss of only one man from the 1926
team, things look favorable for a due
season.

Charles Fall, and Cliff Ingram are
expected to report for the squad, both
of whom are capable of wielding a
dangerous racquet, and may land
berths on the team. other men may
report for the squad, but the man
named are a group whose perform-
ances are the best known ,on the

by a Grinnell tennis team. Meets
have been arranged with the univer—
sities of Kansas and Nebraska, Ames.

Home Track Meet
Will Be Saturday

Prospects for Varsity Squad to
Be Indicated In Yearly
Class Events,

Gl‘lutiell's prospects for the track
selisoll will be largely determined in
the home meet which is scheduled to
hike plat-e Sntnr ,Api 16. This
ilnllunl event is always closely coriv
tested by the various classes,

The old: of 1925 during recent

cars has been a consistent winner.
Since then, however, it is a rossnp for
highest honors.

Tllc freshmen arc aiwa an unv
known quantity and though a num-
ner or them have made a favorable
impression, they have not as yet had
ample opportun y to demonstrate
their ability. Outstanding among the
fr sh include Robert Mark, Howard
Kennedy, and Vernon llaytum in the
sprints; Thorncll Barnes and Lawr-
ence Jansen in the distances with
Wayne Phipps in the high jump. Davis
Green in the pole vault is probably the
most promising individual, in this
event, that has been in school in re
cent years. Due to uncertain weather-
conditions he has not been able to
work out. Warner Taylor in the MD
and in the hurdles shows twel'l' indi~
cation of being high point getter for
the new men, The other men of
promise who have not reported are
Crouch and Briggs, These men will
doubtlessly develop into varsity mes
tcrial in future years.

Sophs Have Stars

The Sophomores have a number of
promising stars in the various events,
namely, Don Duke, Joseph McKee, Cliff
lngram, George McCully, Sam neck
and lvan LeGore. Strong competition
can be expected from the second year
men.

With Draper Long, Wendell Davis,
Jerome Hughes, Harold Hoffman,
Kenneth Miller, Charles Slye, Don
Laird, Ross Eviilln and Ted Bender in
the field, representing the Juniors,
there is certain to be a decided scram-
ble for first honors In a‘maioricy of
events.

The Seniors will have a last chance
to perform for the home folks when
they send the few remaining stars of
a once brilliant constellation. The
class of 1927, while freshmen, won
the Missouri Valley freshman tele-
graphic meet. Rinefort, Meeter. Tal-
hott, Gould. Patton, Whitley and hlalr
are the foremost in the roster find
should show unusual class in their
special events. Niblo has not found
time to turn out for varsity as yet and
his absence in the jumps will be not
iced. He can be counted on to place,
however, in this meet even though he
is not in shape. _

May Break Records

There is a good chance that all the
weight events will cause no little
amount of interest and will probably
be the only ones in which records will
be broken. With Rinefort at his best
the shot put and discuss records are
bound to be lowered. Meeter also
should give a good account of him-

loop, the Two lads tumbled lrom third

into the upper half while Smith now

Another lead in the mid-semester

Ping-Pong Proves Popular Enough
To Threaten, Other Major Sports

Pingrpong has been made a major
sport at Grinnell college! This auc-
ient and royal sport, whose devotees
have been numbered in the hundreds
at the men’s dorms, has been elevated
to its rightful place by order of the
Athletic committee after a. two
months campaign for such recogni—
tion by the men of the school, led by
"Sonny" Davis. The effect of these
tidings as they swept the campus
Tuesday was more for reaching than
even the fondest supporters of the
game had hoped. Little knots of en'

, illuslastlc students Could be seen all

the morning, their arms waving wilds
ly as they discussed the proper
technique for n forehand drive on the
Langan hall table or on that exsbll-
liard creation of Harold’s nndjilddie‘s
Place.

It is rumored that Professor Stoops
gave over the entire period in his
11:20 philosophy class to a discus—
sion of “What effect will ping—pong
have on our 20th century Philosophy?"
and Mr. Fink, when interviewed. in-
tlmztted that While his knowledge of
the game was limited, if it was any.
thing like marbles, it mmt be i1 great
game. For a time it was seriously
considered to ask Professor Perry to
discuss at long chapel, instead at his
prepared subject, a topic of this no-

 

ture, “How much sooner would Cotton
blather have reached the eternal fires
if he had played ping-pong instead of
bridge?"

Interest, however, reached its
height Tuesday afternoon when Coach
F. L Hayes met a pingvpong squad of
seventyvfive hopeful and eager-eyed
youths in Langan hall for spring brace
tice. Coach Hayes reports that work-
outs for the first few days will be
strictly on the fundamentals of the
game. Among those who may be
counted on to bring home tlic Missouri
Valley bacon tor Grinnell are "Stut-
uy” Davis, Ford Stewart, Elmer Chase
and Clarence Jacobson. The last two
mentioned promise an unusual game
when they meet in the intramural
tournament opening April 31. Instead
of "Service," calls of “Laundry" will
be heard when Jake is serving and
"C. and P." when Chase shoots,them
over the net.

Coach Hayes predicts an almost un-
limited future for the game, since, un—
like other indoor sports, it can he
played by men or women alone. Meau~
while the little White sphere bounces

Collitch Inn, while bridge tables are

College .4110 ws
Heirs Property

Hill Esiuie Rellllqlusheil by Trustees
In Des Mullins Court Friday.

According to papers filed in di ‘ct
court in Des Moines Friday trustees
for Grinnell college relinquished all
claims to the estate of Dr. Gcrshom
who left the bulk of his property con-
ditionally to the institution. in giv-
ing up all claims to the property, Grin-
nell does so in favor ol‘the three heirs
named by Dr. Hill.

In his will, which was ﬁled in 1925.
Dr. Hill speciﬁed that his estate
should go to ﬁle college for the pur-
pose of purchasing property adjacent
to the campus, the ground to be used
by the institution and to be known as
“Hill Brothers Park." It further
pronded that an annuity of 5 per cent
on anesthird of the value of the estate
must be paid by the college to each
of the three heirs during their life-
time. The heirs are Mrs. Louisa B.
Hill, Dr. Hill‘s widuw, Dr. Jnha P.
Hill, the physician's daughter; and the
Rev. James L. Hill of Salem, Mass.

No reason was given for declining
the gift except saying “that it is to the
best interests of all concerned.” Ac-
cording to H. H. Stipp, attorney for
the estate, the entire estate is not
valued at more than $30,000, a much
smaller figure than had been gener-
ally believed. The estate, Stipp said,

had been depleted from time to time
by large gifts, which the physician
had made to educational and charl-
tttble institutions.

Baseball ls Next
Intramural Sport

Dibble and Clark Doped to Give
Kelly Stable Champions
Race For Title.

Spring has come, and with it the
next sport on the intramural calen-
dar, Gl'inrlell's contribution to the fa-
mous national sport .Although the
local diamond is as yet inundated by
the recent torrents oi rain, the val'ir
ous hall candidates have had several
days of fine weather to practice.

The race this year promises to be
a fight to the finish, with Dibble hall
and the Kelly Stable team leading the
various packs in a spirited contest.
Clark hall, the local indoor ‘champs
will have a team that will have to be
taken into consideration and will give
either of the last lseason’s leading
teams a run for their money.

Langan, Smith and Building Four
are all more or less of a mediocre
caliber in the baseball field. but this
season may see a change in this‘l-e-
spect, for each of these buildings has
drawn a sizesble group of yearlings,
and in the new house members of
these buildings there may be enough
capable ball swotters and clever hurl-
ers, to turn back the dope bucket fa-
voritcs.

Iniiclds to Battle

At present the struggle promises to
he a battle of infields, with the Kelly
champs and Dibble having an edge on
the other teams as far as this is con-
cerned on paper. Mark. Gray. Chase,
Hicks and Ingram played the' hard
ground positions for the intramural
kings last season, and all will be back
for the team this year, but will have
to buck the opposition of several
promising freshmen. Building Three
has almostthe same infield combina-
tion that they used last season with the
exception of the notorious eoz Good.
Although lacking Good, who had the
reputation for stopping more hit balls
than anyone in the circuit last season.
Manager Doffing has recruited "Skin-
ny" Evnhn to his ranks. and faces the
second base shortage with a good deal
of confidence. Wolf, Niblo, Peterson
and Culver are all first rate bail playv
ers, and with an average burler or
two the Kelly boys can be counted le~
on grabbing a good percentage of
wins. ,

Mocter, Davis out

Clark ball will be handicapped by
the absence ,0: Meetev and Davis who
are ineligible to play because of their
track competition. However, Rose,
McClain, Patton, Hauerbach and Con-
ant form a nucleus for a strong team
from the north side hall.

Langau will have Muudt, Brown,
Herman and Smith for mainstays.
Smith ball will return their famous
Fail to Lovejoy battery, and if given
fair support, will win games for the
Findlay group

George MacKinley is a visitor in
Grinnell today.

exception of Lorenzen who was de~
feated in the Wesleyan debate last
year. This team represents thelead-
ers of the Eastern debating league,
being tied with vale for first place.

To match wits with Harvard, Grin-
