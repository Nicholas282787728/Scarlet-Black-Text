and that under it there should be de- i
partments of the army, navy and ot
aeronautics as proposed by Colonel
William Mitchell."

Beloit supported the proposition. i
while the local team upheld the nega-
tive. The burden or the argument
advanced by the Grinnell men was
that a historical presumption exists
against the proposal. that it would
break down in practice and that the
present system is satisfactory. The
visiting team spent most or its time
pointing out the evils of the existing
kind of defense and enumerating the
advantages ot Colonel Mitchell‘s plan.

Sound logic and excellent presenta-
tion were the noteworthy features of
the contest, from the' standpoint or
both sides. The Wisconsin men
brought with them a record of eight
victories in decision debates this
year. but they were l'ully equalled in
every angle or debating hy the local
speakers.

Although no decision, either by the
audience or by judges, was rendered,
thirty minutes or rapid-lire open
forum discussion lonowed the cone
cluslon ot the formal debate. Pro-
tessor John P. Ryan presided.
