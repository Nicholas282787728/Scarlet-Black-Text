MISSOURI VALLEY PASSION?

With good feeling prevailing over a succcssinl toot»
ball season the Missouri Valley conference representa-
tives will gather for their annual winter meeting in Des
Moines Friday, VVhlle athletic otlieials protor to say that
nothing more than routine oontereoce business will he
discussed, it seems that a great deal will he accomplished
—or should be.

At the annual meeting or the fi'v'e schools, it would
be quite appropriate to hold a juhilce in honor of a suc-
cessful season just past. It has been suede clear to the
old Valley ineinoors, especially to one of our traditional

friends and neighbors, that the i sscllri Valley is not ill-
lori - in football ilbllity, It is a source of satisfaction to
note that the results of games played bctu ecu Missouri
l'alley schools and the Big six were even.

it IS also siglliilcallt to note the satisfaction with
which Creighton university was welcomed into the coil-
tercncc, Witll mcmbcrsllip numbering live, it is likely
that on effort for expansion will be made at tile meeting
Friday. Whether it is ur not, it will be interesting to
watch the results of the meeting.

There are several schools which are desirable for
membership in tllc coutcrcnc Nothing from oll‘icliil
sourccs gives to any indication of belief that anothcr
school in 'bc a ed to join. llowcvcr, it seems that such
a step would be timely. Among the schools which sccln
most logical tor mcmbcr ip arc Wabash, st, Louis uni»
vcrsity, Coc, Carleton and Marquette.

or the list or schools mentioned Wabash seems a
hit remote trom our sphere of interest, st. Louis univer-
sity, n Catholic school, has played two N soul-i Valley
schools in football and meets Grinnell in b shetbail this
winter. However, locill interest sccms to exclude this
school from first consideration. Since Coe and Carleton
are ill the same conference, local opinion is that Carleton
would he the first to be asked from the )llerEstgl‘ollp
thereby -cluding Coe from the first choice.

with Carleton and Marquette as the two remaining
schools from this unofficial list, opinion scents to be that
Marquette has the better chance of being nominated [in
membership. Nevertheless, Carleton is a very desirable
school to have in the conference, They possess a very
fine athletic plant consisting of a modcrn gymnasium, a
stariuln with o seating capacity ot 9000, and the best of
equipment in their field house, Carleton has led the Mid-
West. conference for many years. In fact championships
have been so numcrous that many believe that Carleton
has outgrown her present competition.

Carleton upholds a high scholastic standard and cans
ducts their attairs along the some lines as Gi-inncll.
With Minneapolis and St. Paul as feeders for athletic
contests, good gates are assured. Since the two schools
are so nearly alike, it seems that Grinnell could well a‘ts
ford to champion Carlelon's name at the meeting.

0n tlle other hand Marquette is a school with ivlloin
we have had good relations for three years They have
a good athletic plant, high standal alld always draw
big gates. Certainly Marquette is a deslroble member and
Drake seems to be its champion.

With Drake supposedly supporting Marquette, Wash-
ington ready to put up St, Louis university, Oklahoma
Aggies so for south tltztt they are not vitally interested,
Creighton ready to support Marquette, it seems that
Grinnell lnight do well in choosing Carleton college as
a prospective candidate for an invitation to join the coil-
ference.

This seemed to open the discussion
of publication boards and, though the
students were rather reserved in
making statements, the faculty mem-
bers appeared to he relishing the si
nation

1 was certainly much enlighten-
ed and very happy that Grinnell hall
men with broad enough minds that
they could allow individuality of stile
dent expression without greedily
,wanting to control it.

The convention was well planned
and admirably executed by the North-
western chabter, I hope that some
day Grinneii's new journalism depnrt— .
ment will grow enough and gain in
prestige so that it will be able to aid
the local chapter in entertaining the
national convention.

To-day, you can see big build-
ings erected noiselessly—by
electric welding. ’

The structural steel worker is
dropping his clamoring ham-
mer for the electric arc, Silently,
swiftly, rigidly, economically,
buildings are being fabricated
by electric welding, which knits
steel with joints aststrong as
the metal Itself.

Building silently! Nothing
seems impossible in this elec-
trical age.

Not only in building construc-
tion,but in everyhuman activity,
we instinctively turn to electric-
ity to add to the comforts of
life and to eliminate the wastes
of production—another evi-
dence that the electrical industry
is maintaining its leadership In
this changing world.
