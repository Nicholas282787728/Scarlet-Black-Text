Cooper that they were greeting a typical Crinnellian
returning for a general good time and good fellowship
on Homecoming.

That is the spirit of Homecoming—good fellowship,
It exists in Grinnell strongly enough to bring hack
scores of old grads and formcr students each year for a
day or two in the old environment. They realize better
than those who are yet students here that the time
spent at Grinuell means more than so many themes
written, more than so many statistics amassed and
thrown bodily at a professor who would dearly love
to escape reading them. They realize that their years
at Grinnell brought friendships that need to be renewed
each year.

Gary Cooper flew half way across a continent to be
here once more and enjoy Crinnell friendship. We
welcome him and everyone who returns for the same
reason. And that percentage, we’ll wager, runs higher

WELCOME GARY AND EVERYBODY.
It is rated, a dyed-in-the-wool certaintyvthat this
\Homecoming will go down in Grinnell history as the time
when “Gary Cooper came back." The co- ds have been
sufficiently thrilled to admit almost this much since
the news got out yesterday, and the men felt in greeting

SCHOLARSHIP APPLAUDED‘J WELLl
Yesterday morning witnessed the strange scene
which is enacted twice a year. High merit In scholar-
ship was applaudod by part of the student body who
attended chapel to witness the awarding of Phi Beta
Kappa ”Shingles.” The student body frankly recog-
nized that high scholarship was desirable!

To many who live day in and day out in the dormi-
tories and quadrangle, the prevailing attitude seems to
be otherwrse. One freshman perhaps expressed best this
spirit which, superficially at least, seems to pervade the
campus psychology, when he said this week, in answer
to the question as to whether he liked Grinnell. “Oh, I
like it now. For a while I thought the assignments were
terribly hard, but now that I've discovered that studying
isn’t the most important thing, I’m enjoying college
life.” .

To adopt this attitude is only natural for freshmen,
for they see and hear the same thing expressed all
about them of the campus. It is the prevailing psy-
chology. on the surface at least.

Such an attitude we decry. This is not a defense of
the “greasy grind." It is a defense, however, of the merit
of scholarship. It is a suggestion to upper-classmen as
well as to freshmen that they include in their college
plans an attempt at high scholarship. It is a hope that
the spirit hack of the applause which yesterday ﬁlled
the chapel when four new members were added to Phi
Beta Kappa will continue to be prominent in student
psychology for the remainder of the year.
