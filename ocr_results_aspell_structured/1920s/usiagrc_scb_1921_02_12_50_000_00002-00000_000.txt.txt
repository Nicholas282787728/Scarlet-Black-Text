SATURDAY,

'lllld LANDSLIDE

Among thediiany election tales, the
one about a prominent local Citizen
who voted the democratic ticket, and
later saw his error, is of much sig—
nificance. lt seems that the man in
question was an independent, as far
as party al'filiations go, and ﬁlter
int‘ich consideration he became fully
convinced'that the Cox platform was
the one most worthy of support.
Having made up his mind, he stuck to
his beliefs.

After the election, with its landslide
in favor of Harding, the man began
to think that maybe he was wrong.
He weighed the Judgment of the many
millions who voted lor Harding,
against the judgment of the few who
voted lor Cox, and although he was
perfectly capable of judging tor him»
self, he finally admitted to his friend
that the mine ty must have been on
The
great majority of people had deemed
that Harding was the man for the
place, therefore the Judgment of the
man who‘voted for Harding was bet»
tel' than his man who voted for Cox.

Even taking the political propa-
ganda and tricks that were brought
into play into consideration, the fact
remains that Harding wun by a. land
slide. The country as a whole is he-
hind him. The man who admitted
that he might have been wrong has
shown his confidence in the Judgment
of the grant mass of people as match—
ed against his own private views. He

was outvoted.

Here on the campus a. proposition
has been put before the stud6ht body
for consideration. students were asks
ed if they Considered Grinnell Worthy
of rescue from financial failure, and
the answer was either to make a.
small subscription, or' else simply to
refuse.

Before the proposition was put to
a. test, the result was a matter of
speculation, much as the recent elec-
tion. Everyone thought that the
Harding campaigners would win, but‘
they Weren’t sure, Everyone thought
that Lhe endowment campaign would
Win out, but they weren't able to pre-
diCt the result. But the vote has been
taken, and the result is once more .1.
landslide for Grinnell.

But there are some who voted No.‘
They are being asked again. If the
man in the story had been given all
chance to change his vote to make it'
unanimous 101' Harding. he would;
have done so.

The Judgment of the school is against,
those who refuse to give. It is not as J
if it were a. financial impossibility.
Those‘ who are known to he in the
worst financial shape have volunteer—
ed to give, and have given more Lhau

Californians mar cl at the coining
of a “laudluhber” from 1500 miles in—
land to tell them about sharks. ac-
cording to a story from a San Diego
paper, in which the exploits of Prof.
H. w. Norris, local "hugolpgy" prm
fessor, are recounted. Professor Nor»
ris has been studying sharks and
other deep sea fish at a San Diego
laboratory, studying nerve organs,
and many other intricate studies,
While on his vacation". The story
(allows in par .

About a year and a half ago a slen»
der, vivacious young woman appeared
at the La Jolla. biological station and
spent her working time for about a
month in studying sharks and their
kin when they werc caught in the
vicinity. She explained that she was
doing this work as assrstant to Prof.
H.\\'. Norris of Gl’innell college in
Iowa, and mat he would sooii follow
to continue the work. He finally or»
lived this fall and he lost no time in
getting acquainted with the shark
population. lie spent hours fishing
icr tlieui himselt and he spent other
hours wandering about the fishing
bout landings of San Diego looking
for catches made by lislierincu. As
a l'esull be accumulated in Llllee
months an amount 0!. information
tail-ly- astonishing to most of us moi—
dents in that vicinity. A few days
ago he told us some or the things
which he had learned.

Finds Mluiy Specimens

For one thing, be has obtained in
that tiine specimens of 13 different
kinds of sharks and has had report
of one other. In addition he thinks
three or four kinds are likely to be
seen. He has also obtained 12 dilr
lercnt kinds of rays, with report of
one other and hope of seeing two or
three others. Most of the rays are
skates and sting iays. In talking
about these sharks and rays he re-
minded us that though all had skele-
tons of card tge, a few had certain
parts of the cartilage so hardened as
to resemble hone. One lay has a
skull so hardened in this way as to
require it heavy hammer to break it,
While a typical shark has a skull
which can be out like cheese.

He mentioned some interesting dil-
ferences in shape. Although most
sharks are long and rounded, there
is one that is somewhat flattened
(the angel shark) and it is about the
ugliest of the lot. There is another
(the thresher) which has a tall as
long as its body. The bonito shark
is shaped like a bonito oi- tuna and
it also resembles these food fishes in
the excellence of its flesh.

Ben] Purpose In Work

Having told us these and similar
things which We could easily under-
stand, Dr. Norris then modestly re-
ferred to the real Work. which he is
doing with all of these sharks and
shark-like fishes. It appears that
somewhat more than 30 years ago an
English anatomist, W. H. Gaskell.
Dropounded a theory of the Structure
of the nervous system which has
aroused a. great deal of controversy
among mmmists ever since. Some
of the American supporters and. elab~
