a comps the pan as often cncli
locality tries to reach the mniinuinr
nun-l: on the thermometer in summer
and the lowest point in winter." He
went on to compare the atmosphere
with the ocean in density, cliaiitcter,,
and volume. l
Barometric llrc<slirc is closelyl
studied in connection with weatherl
forecasting bill. the question is raised
why should it he since it is not seiisr-‘
tive to climate change? The :tnsii‘el"
given by Di'. Davis n as that the liendﬁ
ills of the harometer is closely read‘
because it concerns the factor-snhicli
do aifect weather such as lelli»
pcrature, winds, and rain. He inter—
iectcd at this moment the fact that
winds are properly known as wind]
currents caused by the pushing away
of the air iron: a region where ex-
pansion has taken place to a region
where il. can maintain a uniform
depth. The air and moisture enter
the soil and cause what is known as
a climate of the soil. ”The climate ol
the soil has a significant fact, One of
the features in the arid regions is thei
growth of useful plans by irrigation
of the soil. The air which was form—
erly hot and dry becomes moist by
the contact with the soil and fosters
plant growth," explained Dr. Davis.
Two Methods of Studying
He went on , "There are two meth—
ods of studying climate. The numer-
ical method is the study of the ther-
mometer and observing the cloudiness
of the sky as well as other factors
common in weather change, This is
a locnl observatian. The regional
method on the other hand is the study
of these conditions over a larger area.
and this method is found to he prefer-
ahle to the other."
The comparison of the atmosphere
and the ocean shows the likeness in
- very few respects. The atmosphere is
a gaseous sphere around the earth
that weighs as much as a sphere of
water around the earth to a depth of
thirty feet. “The atmosphere has no
specific depth as the ocean lines," one
plained Dr. Davis. "Rather we must
think of it as extending out into the
infinr although raritied in propor~
tion to its depth. We have proof of
the presence of oxygen by the flames
of meteors tor it is the particles of
this gas that 'gnite the meteor in its
fall."
biﬂereiice in Composition
The difference in composition be—
tween air and the ocean as pointed
oiit by the speaker consists in the
means of combination of the coni-
ponent psi-ts. Water is the compound
of elements that lose their identity in

stated that no funds hall been receive

only enough money to pay the tenchv

is no reason Why We can't have an

Matthews, representative in China.
“The school is beyond donht on the

A. 25 per cent raise in the fees this
year served not to decrease but to
increase the enrollment.”
