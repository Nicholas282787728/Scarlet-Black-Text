times," said Dr. stcincr in his chapel
tlllk yesterday. ”She has had her
ll'cntlhrful halr cut off and now has
bobbed hair, cut by electric clippers,
She has gone to the trou‘ble of having
a permanent Wave put in it with vari»
ous instruments of torture. Slle

when she feels low-brow she will read

"Her husband, Babbitt, represents
American business and has time to
read the newspaper only. They have
three children who I fear are a. great
nuisance to them.

"To the great joy of the father the
ﬁrst born was a. boy and they named
him Progress." Dr. Steiner went on
to describe this child. The parents
gave him every conceivable toy and
spoiled him. These toys were me-
chanical and in the last grent War the
skies were dotted with aeroplanes and
balloons, the streams were polluted,
the ground was torn up, the lungs of
man was destroyed ’by gas, towns were
devastated, and millions gave their
lives to Satisfy Progress in his capers.
“In fact,” said Dr. Steiner, "there is
so much of Progress today that he im—
Dede: real progress and it he is to
have room to play in, he must annex
the Milky Way.”

The second child was a girl-and
was promptly named ”ProSDcr '
This young lady from the beginning
displayed a. temper and a tempern
merit and her temperature Was record-
ed in every paper in the whole world,

reading material and ideas. Dr, stcincr
explained that she thought or Jesus as
a perfect specimen of vitiinincs and
glandular theory. She was trouhlod

“The child that should be in the
home is Wisdom and, it this child

should come, it would teach the lam- ‘

ily licaiity and make the home a real
place to live in. This child would
teach that the fundamental law oi
marriage is love. "I am alraid Babs

concluded Dr Steiner. '

New Apportionment oi Semester Feet"
Gives $100 for Curling 0“
Women‘s Delmtcs.

An additional hundred dollars to tler
fray the expenses of women's debat-
ing, was a part or the new semester
fee distribution, made 'by the student
council in a meeting held Sunday aft-
ei-noon.

The total appropriation for debate is
now $500, the same its in the past. Last
year the expenses of both men and
women were paid out of the amount,
but this fall only $400 was allotted for
debating, which was felt by those in
charge to he too small an amount.
The $100 was taken from the athletic
fund whose share or the total amount
usually amounts to considerably over
hallI

The student council also voted an
exta $40 from the semeste fees for the
lecture course. The money was
granted to make up for a. deﬁcit paid
by Fofessor E. B, T. Spencer, in
charge of the lecture course. It was
voted to take this amount from the
funds or other drgahi'zations.

The football team has esta' islled
Olne new Grinncll traditions in the
Way of idols to Lady Luck. some of
the members of the grid squad have
-l)cell caught in the act of carrying
about victory charms of an unusual
lnatui-o. Did you eVel‘ hesr cl a big
wad of cotton bringing the bearer
luck? Or a horseshoe picked up on
a certain football field in the Vicinity
ol Oklahomcl The team has and hes
licvcs it, so that a journey to any
place by the pigskin Chasers resem—
bles a totem pole parade in the Klon-
dike. At the Aines game a prominr
ent member of the coaching staff
wore no overcoat and the same suit
he had worn at Oklahoma A. and l\[.
the Week before, though at the latter
contest the Snow was blowing about
his ears, A much deloi-nncd tackling
dummy which had brought victory to
a high school in Oklahoma was car»
lied to the Cyclone struggle as an
offering to the goddess cl Luck. Ev-
ery little thing or omen which even
savored ol Victory was carried and
