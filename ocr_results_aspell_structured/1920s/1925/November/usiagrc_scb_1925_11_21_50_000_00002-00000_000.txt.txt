Dear Editor:

Soon another football season will
have been completed in which Grill-
liell's team has become a dreaded ice
in .ui ouvi valley athletics Many
of us have watched with admiration
the grit and determination that has
developed the “never licked" spirit of
that team.

We have also watched these same
determined mcu collie limping off the
iicld, sometimes having received in-
niries making them unsciviceablc to
the team for the remainder of the sea-
son. Sonic of these inuircd men have
worked hard for tour seasons, in some
cases having "n armed the bench" for
two va ity years and in their last
)eur having become an indispensable
cog in our iootball machine. They
are inpu-ed because they insisted on
fighting hard and their final chance
to will recognition is squelcher], The
college professor who recently said,
"It is harder to win a letter than an
A. )3. degree," summarized, in a sense,
the condition vight here in Griuuell,

And again, it seems inconsistent in
the case of two men of equal value
and with the same spirit, that one
-hcula be rewarded and the other not.
A quarter is only a measure of time
and naturally the coach substitutes
at the logical moiucut with no regard
to llow much of a full quarter a luau
has played or course, it lent his
to see how many men he can
award letters, but to win the . rue
regardl The man who plays tell
full mu tcrs wills his letter deserv-
cdlr, but the other man who has
played the equivalent in actual time
finishes his season uuauardcd.

Campus opiuiou, including many
letter lucn, feels that many men have
graduated without a letter due to the
luelasticity of rule that regulates such
awards. This does not mean to criti-
cize any person, committee nor men
having deservedly won lette but to
emphas .c the need or a more fl i
blc ruling for llonolillg thc fleClVlng
cum We, therefore, suggest that
awarding of letters he made through
the r omuicndation of the coach,
who is competent and a good Judge of
tile deserving player at the close of
the season.

ancient Greeks were likewise very ree

middle ages were filled with men of
fautical religious beliefs who went

The second foolish virgin

Crane referred to thc wellrkiiown pest
who, alter giving cause for offense,
evades responsibility by saying that
he “meant well" or "my heart was in
thc right place, anyway." “Every—
body has spasms of generosity," the
speaker continued, and the‘ drunken
man who drops a dime in the blind
lnftn's cup, deserves no particula
crcdit for doing so.

The lamp borne by the third of Mr.
Crane’s quintet of foolish vi -gius,
lacked the oil or a trained will. “Tile
thing that needs the lllost traiuiugand
gets the least is the human will." In
n peculiarly moving way, Crane show:

American soldiers who served in
France during the war, succumbed in
mauy instances to the pitfalls with
which they were surrounded, because
there was no oil of a trained will in
thcir lamps. ‘

The fourth sister was she who bore
the burden of the lamp of goodness
without the oil of gladness. Here the
speaker became very emphatic in
stating that there are two kinds of
“good" people: those who are good
and gloomy and those who are good
and glad. “Be good for your own
sake- be cheerful for your room-

mate‘s sake," was a piece of advice

of his own experience

Finally, the lamp of love without
the oil of loyalty is no more useful
than that borne by the iilth of the
foolish siste . The deepest law or
the human heart is that people who

ried lire grow into love. “People
