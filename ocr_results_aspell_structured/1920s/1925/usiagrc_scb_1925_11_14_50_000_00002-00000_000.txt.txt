SPOEING THE GREEN.

The holding of freshmen and var—
sity football practice on the lawn east
of the dormitories is cutting up the
turf and making such a mire that
there will be nothing more than a
barren tract when spring comes
along.

The stretch between the dormitories
and the stadium should be preserved

,leaving the cinder driveway.
l

ever, an occasional car does no dain-
age compared to a few dozen pairs or
cleats digging in the soft turf every

night.

The football men must have

place to practice and if necessary no
one would object to giving them any

It would be Worth While for the

A POSSIBLE DANGER.

The increasing interest in inn-ate
mural sports and the announcings of
a building debate tournmncnt may be
taken as signs of the starting of a new
relationship between the various
halls.

The feeling between the halls has
always existed and Whether for good

is growing stronger. Encouraged by:

Do wc want this rivalry to no car-
ried to the extent that now exists be-

and in universities? It is possible
that within a few ycars the cleavage

great that “fraternity” politics will be
a menace. Some day every campus
election may arouse bitter feeling be-
tween the buildings.

Perhaps this intense dormitory spir-
it is inevitable it outside activities are
conducted in any form of competitive
basis. Is it the logical thing to e
pect, and if so, do we want it?

Perhaps with outside activities de-
veloped to a high point of inter-build-
ing competition, there will be more
of a tendency toward regulation. A
valuable step in this direction would
be to limit the number of extra-
curriculum activities in which
man can participate.

be carefully watched. The halls, sit-

make for harmony and cooperation

emnity arising under the same roof.

at the edge of the camp. Here he was
stopped with the demand dint he give

Editor Scarlet and Black: I

Twice this semester the student body
has faced the interesting and puzzling
situation of having to pay money he-
sides presenting the semester fee in
order to obtain decent seats at foot»
ball. games,

concerning the seating situation at
the Kansas game we find that a small
section, to be exact, from the 20 yard
line to the goal, has been reserved in
the wooden bleachers for those not
willing to pay extra to see the game.
This section, besides being the poorest
section on the entire field, can not
possibly seat more than 125 people.
Suppose the people holding semester
fees refuse to pay for entrance to the
game. 125 people in the student body
can see the game and heaven knows
what would become of the rest. Evin
dentally they would not be admitted to
the game cvcn though they hold scm
fees (in spite of the fact that sem fees
admit to all athletic contests.) Per-
haps the authorities would grant the
permission to stand back of the goal
posts but from the present view of
things even this is doubtful. They
simply could not see the game because
they were unwilling to pay extra.

Not knowing who is responsible i
feel at pcrfect liberty to say what 1
think about the subject. I have talked
to twenty-five people, including some
faculty members, about this, and 2v»
erything but a cheertul spirit pre—
vailed. Every one of these people
(with the exception of one) felt Drct~
ty sour about the whole business.
They voiced their opinions in different
ways ranging from “It's a mighty tun.
ny situation" to "it's a damned gmf

I will not take it upon myself to say
that it is a gralt, but 1 will say that
it is a funny sitztution." I realize it
costs money to put on games but it
seems to me that the strident body- is
just about as hard up a. group as any-
one else. Last year an extra charge
was made and they got away with it.
This year the team has played three
home games and extra charges have
been made for two of them, Prob
ably the only reason charges were not
made for the third was because no
group, no matter who they were.
would have had the crust to make an
extra charge for that game. The se—
mester fee is supposed to admit——
grant that is all that is printed on it—
but admission usually means a seat. I,
know very few places where an ml-
in' sion fee is charged and then on theI
inside another fee entitles you to a
sect. That is practically what thei
present scheme amounts to.

As i said before, I do not know who
is responsible but I think that 1 can
give them a side tip. If they are hard
up, it would create a [ar better feel—
ing among the students to have them
come out and say so and ask for help
and cooperation from the strident body
than it would to organize a money
making scheme and make it function
under the painted name of “reserved
seats." 1 think that the student body
will cheerfully help on an open deal
but they will not help and it only
causes dissatisfaction to be "sucked
in" time after time on something that
they are helpless to prevent,
