(An interview with Prof. C. Is, Payne)

“It is interesting to note that Ghan»
di’s political inﬂuence in India has
practically disappeared. Ghandi, who
was born in India and cducatcd in
England, first sprang into prominence
about twenty years ago by his work
in South Alrica among the Indians
who had migrated there. Later he re—
turned to India. and became one of the
most poweriui religious leaders India
has ever known. In the eyes or both
the East and West he has made him-
self a saint.

“During the earlier part of his career
be favored the British government, as
the only lorcc that could keep pcacc
between the hostile religions and the
races that make up India. Iaut the
Amritsar massacre, the spread of so—
cialistic ideas and Britain's treatment
of Turkey alter thc war, brought him
into alliance with the leaders ot the
Mohammedan party, and converted
him to the idea of driving out the Engr
lisb by non-cooperation.

“Refusing to have anythingto do with
the English, he began to preach tbc
doctrine that India was being contam-
inated and demoralized by western in-
dustrial civilization. India, he Inle-
clared, must get back to the spiniiiug
wheel and the simplicity of the old
Indian life. (Incidentally. Mr. Ghandi
himself drives a Ford.)

"Today it has become apparent that
his policy oi noircooperation hns bras
ken down, At the recent All-Indian
conference, he admitted his failure as
a political leader, and came over to
the Swarm laction, lcd b ' It, Das,
The Swami were origiimll u favor-
of violence, but are nowadays coming
to rcalize that the only hope l'or the
ruliillmcnt of their program lies in
constitutional methods. Consequently,
there is likely to be 12. disturbance
in India and a steady growth to a do-
minlou status, .

"In the meantime, Mr. Ghandi i-
mains a tremendoust important so
cial and religious leader. His almost
uncanny hold on the great masses of
the Indian people, through his saintli-
ness of character, is probably grezm
cr than that oi any other leader in the
world."

"Since the [urination of the new gov-
ernment in England food prices have
reached a higher peak than at any
time since the war, On the other band
due to labor difllculties and the high
cost of production, England is export-
ing less than she is imparting. Her
old “invisible revenues" (revenue from
tourists, loans abroad, insurance. and
freight) have practically disappeared,

V with the exception of that coming from
the tourists. For the iirst time in
fiity years, Euglitud's receipts as a na~
tion are less than her expenditures—

:tlwﬂys an awkward situation, whether
the party concerned happens to be a
private individual or a commonwealth
,ol nations.

"Oddly enough, the present British

government is at tho same time enters
ing on it policy which includes the
improvement at the Singnpul‘e uiu'nl
base, and the strengthening of its her»
icl forc‘cs in an attempt to keep up
with France. When one remembers
that England is also poring interest on
an immense Wiu' debt to America, it is
not surprising to learn that the Eng-
llsh today are paying higher taxes
than any nation in the world,

“France is economically sound but
ﬁnancially embarrasse . while Ens-
lanfl is [inimciillly sound, but in very
uncomfortable straits economically."
