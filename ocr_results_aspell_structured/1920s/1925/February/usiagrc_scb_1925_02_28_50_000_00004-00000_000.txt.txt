An inter-dormitory track and lield

nasium. Saturday, March 7. Three
held and three trach events are sched-
uled; the tormer including the high
jump. broad jump, and sllotrput; and

pluces; three. two and one, respectiv
b:

Any man is eligible to compete who
has never taken part in andntercol-
legiate track meet. All entries must
be in the hands 01 either R. w. Rogers
or H. H. Hurt by Friday, March 5, and
to stimulate interest each building is
urged to appoint a captain, whose dn-
ty it will he to select a team.

The success or the enterprise de-
pends upon the interest which is
aroused and for that reason every eli-
glble man, regardless or previous track
experience, is urged to enroll. ii the
meet is successful, another one will he
held Ia few weeks later.

i We would not have had to see a’
weather report to learn of the recent
cold snap. as we heard so many folks

lamenting their debts on dead Coons.

University professors are continue
‘ally inter ‘ewed hy the press and they
otten» say interesting things. Recently
a New York savant startled the East
by saying that he foresaw the end of
laughter.

The end or laughter? Why, come to
think about it now, lite isn’ll as funny
as it used to he. People, especially
students, seldom laugh uproarlously
any longer. Nowadays they smile he-
hind closed palms. There are not so
many things to he laughed at now,
Everything staid and serious. Lectur-
ers try to help things along by telling
and revtelllng the same old jokes, and
students try to laugh but can’t.

The world may not he as funny as it
used to be, but there is no complete
dearth of laughter. There is, never—
the-less, dire need at laughter by those
engaged in the serious occupation of
acquiring an education. Laughter will
be the last thing to pass from this
earth. ‘

We can heed the professor's gloomy
production as a warning. butitwc take
him too seriously, however, we will
defeat the sheer object which prompt
ed it. To believe it implicitly spells
melancholia. The end at laughter?
That's a joke in ltselfliDally Califorr
nian.
