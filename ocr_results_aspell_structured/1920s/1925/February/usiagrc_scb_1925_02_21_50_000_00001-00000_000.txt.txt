Student Council and Faculty Asked to Vote on

System Which

Aims to

Abolish

Unnecessary “Red Tape.”

Specific recommendations for a
more cooperative campus life are to
he made immediately to various cam
pus organizations as a result 01 the
studentr‘aculty conference called by
President Main at the Close of the
Ch istuias recess. The conference,
which held its last meeting Satui‘da
February M, was a purely unofficial
body with no legislative power What»
ever. 01: the contral' it was intend-
ed inerely as a clearing house for stu—
dent and faculty ideas—as a consulta-
tive hotly for developing and crystal-
lizing opinions on current problems of
campus life. The recommendations
some’ of which, regarding scholarships
and outside acti ties have already
been published in the Scarlet S: Black,
are made chiefly for the purpose of
stimulating interest in these problems,
although it is hoped that many of
them Will eventually be put into ef—
fect, wf

The personnel of the conference
consisted of Professors C. N. Smiley.
E. D. Strong, R. H. Perring and Elea-
nor Lowden; Klella Warcham, Kather-
ine Davis, Dorothy Smith, Alta Eoue

Jr., Neil Crone, Leon Jones, Lester
Duke, and James Pierce; President J
H. T, Main, Deans John S. Nollen, Lou
ella J. Reed and Paul biacEacbron
were also members of the conference.

constant necessity of referring init-
ters back and forth from one body to
another before they can he finally act-
ed upon, the committee on selfrgov-
ernment. consisting of Mr. MacEach—
ron, Klella Wareham and John Mc.
Gee, proposed the establishment of a

Local Iron/ni‘Smitll, Burlingnine, iinll
Mid—Puts up Good Battle
Against Creighton.

(By- James work)

Robert Burlingame, '28, Russell
Smith, '23, and Loren Reid, ‘27, each
appearing ior the second time on the
local varsity debate platform, made
a distinctly favorable impression
Thursday evening on the small crowd
which heard them uphold the negative
of the proposition, “Resolved, That
Congress should be empowered to
over-ride by a two-thirds vote de-
cisions of the Supreme court which
declare acts of Congress unconstitu-
tional" against an experienced team
from Creighton. Lack of general in—
terest in debating was evidenced by
the failure of upperolassmen to try
out for the local team, but Thursday
night's performance assures founda-
tion material for teams for several
Years.

The best speaking of the evening
was done by Robert Burlingame, on—
enmg the case for the negative. With
admirable poise and self-control Mr.
burlingnme refuted the affirmative
contention that the Supreme court
played to class interests, and main-
tained that the Court always protects
the will of the people as it is express
ed in the constitution.

The judge, Prof, J. 0. Carroll, de~
bate coach of Drake universitv, rend-
ered his decision for the affirmative
after an illuminating discussion and
criticism of the argument at both
sides, His decision found favor with
the audience.

The contest was presided over by
Prof. E, D. Strong. Eugene Breiteii~
hach was the exacting time keeper.
We suggest a tom tom for the latter
functions , at the next debate. The
debate was, on the whole, decidedly
superior to the contest with Amos
some weeks ago, and deserved a bet-
ter attendance.

The University of iliissouri, showing
a complete reversal of form over their
game on Grinnell's floor, decisively
downed the Pioneer live by the score
of 37 to‘2s. The Tigers displayed
the most powerful defense they have
shownthis season and held Moran, the
Gi‘innell scoring acc to one basket.

in spite of the fact that Boge took
the tip off and Moran charged through
to start the offense, the Bengal de—
fense completely stopped the Pioneers
and had the ball in their possession
three-fourths of the ti me. The Missouri
aggregation displayed their short pass
system and consistently worked the
ball undcr tho Grinnell basket for
short shots,

Grinnell took the lead early in the
game with two long baskets from Boga
but a basket by Joyner and free toss-
es by Buchller and O'Sullivan put thcl'

in the lead 20 to 13 but early in the
second half got a scare when Gelviu

The Missouri defense tben tightened
and they again forged in the lead,

The outcome of the [my against

Pioneer hopes as the Tigers were ex-
pected to he the weakest opposition
the Scarlet and Black would meet on
its trip. However the defeat by the
Missourians may serve to [put the fire
in the Grinnell attack that will be
needed if the Films are to be down—
ed tonight. ,

The fact that the Pikers downed
Nebraska last night and are now in
second place in the Valley shows that
the Pioneer defense will have a real
job on its hands for in Minuer and Sea-
go, the Washington quintet has two
of Lhe best scorers in the conference,
The Piker team is one of the smooth—

but is not unbeatable, and if Moran
has his eagle eye for the loop, Crin—
nell has it chance of winning.

After resting Sunday, Coach Black

Monday night’s return engagement

he another tough proposition ior the
Pioneers, judging from the class they
displayed on the Grinnell floor last

and the Scarlet and Black five may
