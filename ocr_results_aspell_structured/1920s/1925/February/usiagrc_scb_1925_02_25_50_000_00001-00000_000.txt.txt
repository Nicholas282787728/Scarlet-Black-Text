some of the Sophomore girls have led
to the belief that there are to be sure
prises in store which have never been
heard of before in the history of this
circus troupe. With the doors open—
ing promptly at four o'clock, a parade
is the first scheduled event. Yes. all
the animal trainers. clowns, tumblers,
charioteel‘s, and wild animals will be
present. A pony chorus a reﬁll, hon-
est-to-goodness wild west show, a
chariot race With—well, that's a Se-
cret, and a. tumbling act are a few of
the attractions of the afternoon per-
formance. Wild animals will he put
through their repertoire of tricks by
experienced trainers, and the freaks
of the show will be exhibited in side-
show tents. Peanuts ahd pink lemons
ride will be on sale to give the real
circus atmosphere.

This circus is an annual affair put
on by the girls of the sophomore class
to which all college girls are invited.

teams losing to Clark hall who placed
second in the rake. Their A team,
consisting of Sweet, Long McLoiil,
