The following report on relations

will work her great harm.

Although not many specific recom-
mendations were adopted by the con-
ference. the matter or coeducational
social life was taken up in some de-
tail, in the hope that serious consider-
ation would be given this problem by
both students and faculty. The report
submitted by a committee consisting
of Miss Read. Dorothy Smith, and Jun-

 

lleves such acquaintanceshlp to be ab-
