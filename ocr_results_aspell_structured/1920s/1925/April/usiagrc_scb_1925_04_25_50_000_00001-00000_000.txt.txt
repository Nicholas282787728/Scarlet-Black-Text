(CDurle‘ of H. E. Sanders Rllflih)

The sixteenth annual Drake relays
run all at Des Muines this, afternoon
was one of the greatest eier held,

with more records broken than ever1

before, Tire truck was the lastest it
has ever been, enabling the runners
to shatter old marks with case. in
the high school, college and university
sections, the two thousand athletes
who had gathered for the Bulldog re-
lays endangered records ever-y tinrc
they competed in it track or field
event.

The Pioneer track team coached by
"Doc" Huff made a good showing for
the Maltese cross. Morgan Taylor,
Olympic champion and Grinnell cap~
tain, was one of the most popular men
running but he failed to win the 120
yard hurdles, taking a third. close
behind Kinsey aird Guthrie. Riherorl.
was third in the discus with a great
toss. - The half-mile relay team cnm<
posed of Scharnwehel‘, 1.. Jones, Kite
clien and Taylor won the ﬁrst section
but the time was too slow to place {or
the ﬁrst four times made in the other
section were all faster than that made
.‘by the Grinnell quartet. However the
Pioneers would probably have done
better had they been pushed. As it was
Huff's men won by a so or in yard
margin. Michigan, who won the
event, set a new relay record of 1 milk
ute 21% seconds.

In the ﬁrst university event of the
afternoon, the 120*yal'd hurdles, Guth-
i'ie of Ohio state was ﬁrst in the r -
markniile lime of :14 8710 which ties
the old record. Kinsey at Illinois
was second and Taylor of Grinnell
was third. Marigold of Illinois was
fourth. Taylor was one of the favor»
ites in this event but the pace sat by
Guthrie was too fast for the Pioneer
Olympic champion, Weir of I\ -
braska was disqualiﬁed for knocking
over too many hurdles.

Rinefoi-t, Grinnell discus heaver
had to be content with third place as
he could not equal the marks made
by Schwarzc and Richerson, both} oi!
whom broke the old record. Rinefoft's
toss of 138 feet 6 inches lacked 374
inches or breaking the old Drake re-
lay record, Gillespie of Goe, who
was not expected to qualify for the
finals, surprised the crowd by placrng
fourth with a throw almost as good as
Rincfort's.

The four mile university relay was
a battle all of the way between Texas
U. and Oregon Agricultural college.
The Oregon Aggles led until the last
mile when the famous Reece of Texas,
who has dcfcotcdioie Rily, passed his
man easily and sprinted to win his
race.

One of the bcst marks of the day
was made by Schuu ,e of Wisconsin
with his shot prrt of 47 feet d as in-
ches. This was the second new rec
ord of the day for the Badger weight
man as he had already bested the old
discus record.

The two mile college relay was of
special interest to town fans on an
count of the splendid me put up by
Cornell college. The Purple half mile
ers were game to the finish but were
unable to nose out the Haskell Ills
dians.

locks of Ncbr a came through as
expected in the loo yard dash and
copped ﬁrst honors with the record
tieing time of 3 4—5 seconds. VVlttilian
of Michigan was second,

Mcchcn of Kansas State Teach»
ers Cleared the bar at 12 feet 9 the
ones to win the pole Vault, He tried
to break the wul‘ld‘s record but, failed.
to make a leap of 13 feet 3 inches and
had to be content with the lower
mark.

The racouet wlelders who will rep-
resent Grinnell have not hecn chosen
for according to the system now being
used it will depend upon the rating
of the squad at the time of the meet.
Nrcolet and Brady are almost certain
to play for the Pioneers but who the
other two will be is doubtfrrl. West
Stotts is one of the liest tennis men in
school. but up to date he has been
playing very little and is therefore
low in the ranking list, If he plays
several matches the first of the week
he will probably make a rapid climb
and he may get into action against the
Aggies, Halsey, Moore and F. Jones
seem to be the best bets for the other
nosllion on the quartet.

Ames' strength is unknown this year
except that She will be considerably
weakened by the loss of her last year's
star-s, Clayton Paige and Young. Ad—
vance dope would indicate that the
Pioneer net sound has a chance to
start the season with a win.

Barrere Is Pleasing
In Unusual Program

REMARKABLE FLUTE PLAY-
ING BY LEADER IS WELL
RECEIVED.

(By E, H. Bilhal'z)

Ml'. Bal‘l‘el‘e and his Little SYD!‘
phony provided us with a Concerte In-
time last evening in Herrick chapel.
All enthusiastic audience aDDi'Dved of
the novel progt'tlm and llll‘. Bal‘l‘el‘e's
friendly, intimate manner of present.—
iiig it.

The program divided itself into two
parts. The lil’Sl. consisted of the
Hayden “Selloolinaster” symphony In
A flat. and a. Tchaikovsky suite, coin-
1)ositinus which are familiar items in
the repertoire DI similar organiza—
tiDns. The last. Dari. included some
works which are heard infrequently:
Gl'iffes' “The White Peacock," [W0
Aubades by Lalo, a group of solcs' by
Mr. Barrere and it Suite by Pierne.

The performance 01 the Hayden
Symphony was characterized by splem
did ensemble, while Mr. Bal'rere's
reading gave to the composition all
that it. deserves in me Way of nar-
rative tone, lightness'and tempo. The
Tchaikovsky suite, under his baton,
became a series of exquisite Lone
Vignettes, superb in their clarity and
careless charm.

Placed in a. prominent position on
the program was Charles T. 'Grlifcs’
ballet music for ”The White Peacock."
This composition abounds in rYthmlc
Surprises, fitl'ul chromatics. and ev—
asive harmonies. As interpreted by
the orchestra it became a dramatic
interlude, intensely emotional. Wheth-
er Grilfes suspected it or not. he is in
this work at least somewhat akin to
the much derided Stravinsky. What
he lacks of Stravinsky-s power he
gains in intensity of feeling and suave
melody.

To us the rendition of the Lalo
“Auburles” showed the orchestra at
its best. This music was persuasive.’
the technique of each player almost
faultless. In fact Mr. Barrere is to
be congratulated on the individual
performances given by his players.
They proved themselves consummate
arLists.

Mr. Barrere, as a conductor. does
not pencil the eyebrows of his inter—
pretations. There is gravity in his
manner, economy of gesture and no
effort toward sheer exhibition. In a.
group of flute solos he performed in
another role, being eminently success-
ful in producing notes that were gem-
lilte in their perfection. He exhibited
his skill in varied compositions and
was cnthusias really recalled.

There is about h , Barrel-e and his
organization that indefiulible some-
thing which makes the audience feel
mmritdeshlp. Last night we felt. that
the musicians enjoyed this opportun—
lty to play for us, mill we in turn
enjoyed their music. It had all the
spontaneity :Ind zest which is often
lacking in symphonic recitals, Ml‘.
Bal‘l’ei‘e's explanations and anecdotes
place him Second only to Nikita. Bibi»
left in our estimation.

One thing only detracted from the
concert, Tlliit was the lack of de-
Col‘lllli in the chul'llsh young man who
played the flute so Well. Perhaps
we were amusing, but we venture that
lie is being paid for playing the ﬂute
and not. for essdylng a. character in
opera bouffc,
