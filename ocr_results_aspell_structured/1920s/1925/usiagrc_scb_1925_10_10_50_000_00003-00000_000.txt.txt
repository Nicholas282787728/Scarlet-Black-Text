he continued, httei- quoting troni‘
Silnlwspe s “Hamler and excerpts
troiii Browning to prove his r st
point.

The speaker expressed the heliet
that every man had a hingdoni, a lit
tle sphere of his own, nut that his
success was not measured either by;
his kingdom or by his job, hut by the
\l'gy he treated them.

He narrated the story irom the
Bible concerning Saul and the ser-
vant, who went to look for his lath-
er's asses Saul hecaine discouraged
and wanted to give up; however.
Saul's helper urged him to overcome
the obstacles, with the final result
that saiil met on the read some ser-
vants oi God, including samuei, who
made him captain oi israel. The
story is an illustration of the fact
that the mark you aim at may not he
the mark yoii hi —"it doesn't matter
so much how it is or where it is, out
how you treat it."

Thursday

"The Literature of the Easy way.”
a sequence to his talk on the litera~
ture oi gloom, was the subject of
Prof. Cecil F. Lav-en's chapel talk
Thursday morning, He said that to
any problem or conduct, literature
has an answer; one answer s berm»
ty, another is dodging the issue, and
still another is hope. The expression
or these in literature is the easy way
out.

He continued by saying that the
