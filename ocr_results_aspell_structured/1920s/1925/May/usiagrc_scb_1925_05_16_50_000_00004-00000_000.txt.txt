Professor Fre icli, who is also E|
member of the Department OI English
at the University of Iowa, launched
THE MIDLAND as a non-cummerciul
venture in 1915. it was, as an editor.
ial in the first issue said, "it modest
attempt to encourage the making or
literature in the Middle West." There
was no other general literary maga-
zlhe published at the time between the
Alleghenies and the Rockies. There
are none now. with the single excep-
tion of THE NHDLAND.

. In the older and more scph ticated
East there has been a strong tendency
to regard the Mississippi Valley as all
intellectual Sahara where corn, cattle,
hogs, and iraternal orders leit no,
room lor other interests. Honesty
must compel us to admit at least a
shade of justification for this attitude,
Yet. in the past ten years that Pru-
fessor Frederick has edited THE MID- l‘
LAND, he has taken an effectual part
in the winning [or us of respect from

our neielrhors on the Atlantic coast. '

The mere (act that it Middle Westi

perod unsupported by paid advertise
ing, holding to a. lO\\' subscription
price, oiiering no payment money ior_
manuscript, and accepting manuscript
only from residents at the Mississippi‘
Valley states, is in itself a notable
feat. As a sigu oi its pr 'pcl'ity,'
THE MIDLAND has recently been
changed from a monthly to n hi-mon-
thly hasis. l

Through his magazine, Professor-
Frederick has been the means'ot aid.
illg many oi our young writers in the
diiiicult and laborious process oi
working out their artistic problems
and in obtaining puhlic recognition.‘
Moreover, the standards oi THE MID- ‘
LAND are high enough to “in Cork

of the best current poetry and fiction.
In O'Brien's “Best Short Stories for
1924" there are more selections irom
