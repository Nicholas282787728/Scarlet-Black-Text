the faculty which lidd souicliowhiiair

In common with the two other origin-

smart child who “shows off" his ace

knowledge that mother cannot shrank.

We were glad to know that Mr.
Bilharz has read “Babbit”. He incat»
nated him in his household in “Danger
—Crossing" (though the connection
between title and shit is. far beyond
the range of our imagination). a sat-
ire lacking in a deitness and sulitlty
but abounding in vituperation, pro;
sanity, and hair pulling, it was not

Party for Papas and Mamas.” How-
erer, it was well acted, and as a pic—
ture or what the average American
household is not, it was a complete
success.

"They l-late Themselves" was an ac-
ceptable and well motivated burlesque
on campus social lite, the brain child
ot Mr. Craven. Untortunotely, th.
corridor or a recitation hall allows
little movement or business, and the
shit consequently lacked action. it
was well done, by a sympathetic cast.

do not question the lc_ tiniacy or elli-

the “how to George Kaufman" which
the transcriber made should have been
made at least a somersault and a

A review of the Scandals is not
complete without a eommendatory
word ior .iir. McGee, the originator.
promotor, and general manager oi the
production His lertilc brain con
ceived the revue, the lyrics, the tunes,
the dialogue, and most or what was
best; and his tireless energy drove the
production through, despite serious
obstacles, to its successful consum-
mation. starting last year with a
modest production in the Little thett—
tre, he enlarged his conceptions and
made fuller use or bi powers in pre-
paring last night's nerlormanee. it
had its rough pots, as has every pro-
duction, profe nal as well as ama-
teur, but we will not censure him for
ieaching beyond his grasp. in these
two years he has established a high
standard or excellence for the Scari-
dals which it will be indeed difficult
to maintain.
