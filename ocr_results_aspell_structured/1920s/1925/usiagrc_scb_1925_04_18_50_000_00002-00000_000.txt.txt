Dining the past week attempts have
been made to form a new cabinet in
France. The Iii-st attempt, by Bria-id.
uhi i secrncd promising at first, lin»
ally failed. Now Painlevc has suc-
eeeded, He was president of the
Chamber of Deputies, cud is an inde-
pendent 50613, but does not belong
to the Socialist party.

The outstanding members of the
cabinet are Briana, who has become
secretary- of for gn at in , and call-
laux, who becomes secretary of li—
Dance. Briana has been primc minis—
ter of France seven times—a man of
wide experience, great discretion and
tact, one of the foremost orators of
Europe. Caillcux recently came back
into politics alter liuving been exiled
from political life seven years ago af-
ter a sensational tl'lal. lie is brilliant
but unstable, “the stormy petrol" of
French polltlcsiﬂnd has never unite
succeeded in escaping an unsavoury
reputation

A bitter animosity e. ‘sts bclwcon
Caillaur and Clemenceau. Many think
that the former mev yet become prime
minister, If that ever seems likely,
Clemenceau will probably come back
nto political life to oppose him. so
hitter IS the feeling between them.
lionv regard Caillnux, however, as the
ablest financier of France, and the
acute financial situation certainly dev
mands the best of French brains in
that field.

The Socialists will support this Rad-
lcfil cabinet, but neither of their lead-
er , Boncour ol' Blum, have taken of-
fice in the cabinet. Boncour would
probably have liked to do so but is
forbidden l , the custom and practice
of the socia s not to take political
office. i no has led to frequent d2»
serti‘ons of the party on the part of
its more politicolly minded leaders,
among them in the past Brian and
Millel'alid.

The other leader of the Socialist
party—Elum—is more intolerant in
duetn‘naii-e and would probztbiy not
take office if he had the chancc.

The policies of the new government
in foreign affairs will probably be
conciliatory and liberal. very much as

’ was that of the Her-riot government.

In internal matters the embassy to the
Vatican Will probably be i'e-estab-
lished, and a stronger attempt made to
put F‘mnce on a sound financial basis.

It is interesting to note that the exV
tension of paper currency, the immeds
into question on which the Hel‘l‘iot
government fell, has been legalized l),\'
the French Senate and Chamber. It is
maintained that since this is for calm
mercial and not for state reasons, and
since five billion francs have been di»
verted into the Ruhr. that this does
not constitute inflation But the dis-
tinction is somewhat difficult to ac-
cept. The only sound way out for

At a recent meeting of the orthodox
Hindus in Bombay, vigorous attacks
were made on Gandhi. He was ac-
cused of undermining the true Hindu
faith, by his attitude toward the so.
called “untouchables.” The president
declared that Ghdndi's logic about the
removal of the “untouchables" was
fallacious, that there was no such
thing as real equality on the [ace of
the earth, and that the “untouchables"
were segregated because of their on.
clean habits and customs. To the outs
side world Ghaudi's attitude on this
question appears as one of his most
generous and heroic acts but
even India. seems to have its illntla-
mentalists!

At a inceting of the Independent La-
lior party last ucek Mr,
met with a good deal of severe criti-
cism. The Independent Labor party
(the I. L. P.) is the definitely social,
istic wuig of the English Labor party.
lilo greater part of which is made up
of trade unionists who fire not Socials

and MacDonald.
yeutiou of the I. L, F. MncDoualtl sztl
on the floor of the house like any
animal delegate, while speaker after
spockcr roundly denounced his tail-
urcs and mistakes as premier.

It must be remembered, however,
that Mr, MacDonald never actuclly
controlled the House of Commons, and
that lie was always dependent upon
Liberal \‘otcs and that in fol
eign illfail he gave England the best-
administ itioli she had had since the
war.

'louard the end of the tiny MacDon-
fllil himself arose and blought matters

 

 

to their trite proportion by pointing

[An llltenlcw with Prof. C. E_ Payne) '

out that his so-callcd “bad” admini
tratioll had resulted, in the recent
oleciion, in the gain of a million and
a quarter voles. His final statement,
"if evor a party sufferctl such on ov»
crwhelunng reverse" met with
great applause.

Despite the fact that the Kate min~
istry in Japan seemed unstable when
it came into power about d your ugu,
it has succeeded in car 'ing through a
notable legislative program, Japan
has curtailed its military budget by
one-fourth, and seventy»ilve million of
this gain is to be devoted to education.
The franchise has been extended to
ztll men over thll'ty, thus enlarging
the electorate from three to fourteen
million. This will bring into the pc.
litical arena the Labor party, which
as at present constituted is largely
Commllnistic. Active participation in
policies, however, may tone down
their extremist views.

The most startling achievement of
all is the reform of the house of peers.
Thus far the body has been made up
of heredifury members. Henccfurth
one-third will be made up of heredi-
tary peers elected for life by all the
peers; one»third will be appointed for
seven years by the Emperor; and the
other third will consist of peers elect-
ed for seven years by the general
electorate. These are sweeping res
lornis; Japan rapidly grows less mlli»
taristic and more democratic. it seems
unfortunate that st such a moment
the united states should follow up its-
recent wounding of the Japanese sus-
ceptillilities on the immigration dues»
tion by sending her bottle fleet to Pu-
eific writers. an action which s regard—
