The subscription campaign tor the
1927 Cyclone. which runs carried
on last week, has met with a very ens
thusiastic reception. liore annuals

ual at this stage of tire drire in past
years, and it is the desire ot the bus—
iness stair to bring this number as
close to 100 per cent as possiblc. some
or the buildings and cottages have
nearly reached this mark. and it is
the intention to re-eanrass the others
next week.

The Cyclone stall uiil give a smoke

percentage oi subscriptions, and a
large box or candy to the cottage
turning in the largest percentage. in
competing tor this prize only these
subscriptions accompanied by at least
a two dollar payment uill be counted.-
lnasmuch as the contest thus iar has
been Very close the board has tlccidr
'ed not to make this award until thc
campaign is completed. ‘

The beauty contest was one or the
ieature's of this year's drive. Votes
toward the nomination of the tcnmost
beautiml girls in school were given
to Cyclone subscribers on the basis
of their dorm payments. The voting
was conducted in the reading room
of the A. R. H. Wednesday and
Thursday. Photographs ot the ten
girls thus selected will be mailed to
Richard Barthelmess, judge of the
contest, who will select the live most
beautiful. David McCornack, who is
in charge, is zealously keeping the
secret or the [air ones until the au-
nouncement in the Cyclone next
spring.

Most of the soliciting has been done
by sophomore tryouters for the busi-
ness staff, under the direction of
Clitlord chi-rough tor the dormitories
and Edith Weir tor the quadrangle.

Only Man Who Doesn’t Need a Cy»

tacled young man shaking two aus—
ions nickles in a shiny tin cup and
wearing the placard “I'm Dealil’m
Dulnbil’m Blind" greeted those rec
turning from chapel.

gressing rapidly. Several or the op-
ening pages are completed, and many
