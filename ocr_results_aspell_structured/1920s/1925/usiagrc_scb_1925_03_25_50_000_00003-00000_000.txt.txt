Last night the Math. Club enjoyed
a program consisting or two numbers,

Mary Wilson gave a talk entitled, "Big .

and Little Numbers,” in which she
spoke of relative values in proportion
of various things from atoms to stars.
The second number was a discussion
by Howard Smith or the subject, “The
Correlation of High Schoul and Col»
lege Math. Grades." In his talk.
Smith brought out the fact that sta-
stisuos taken from the record or the
class or '24 proves that there is a fair
degree of correlation between the two
grades.

Ben Morgan is the new president of

the club. The other officers are:
