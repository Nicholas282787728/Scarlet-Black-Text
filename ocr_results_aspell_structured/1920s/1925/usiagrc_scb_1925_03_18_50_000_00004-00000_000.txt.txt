Sintc Rciorms

The movement for thc rsorgnhim
tion of the state administration start—
ed in lllinois in 1917. in that siatc a
general program of reorganization,
based upon a. carsiul survey of the ins
stitutions and agencies of the state.
was prepared by an Eilicicncy and
Economy Committee. This program,
in most respects. was put into effect
s;- the state legislature. The law
abolished more than one hundred stnt—
utory oiiices, boards. departments.
and agencies and consolidated their
functions under nihc departments as
icllows: nuance; Agriculture; Labor;
Mines and Minerals; Public Works
and Buildings; Public Wclisro; Public
Health; Trade and Commerce; Regis—
trn'tion and Education. Each depart-
ment is headed by a single director ap-
pointed bv the governor with the sp-
proval of the senntc.1n all cases in
which the departments are called ups
on to exercise quasivlegislazive or
quasigiudicial functions hoards are
provided. in several cases advisory
bolirds were instituted to serve as
counselors to department heads and
the government.

Budgets Established .

Besides administrative reorganizh
tion, the establishment of a budget
system is also part or the general plan
to make the Amerchl-i democracy et-
ilclent as well as responsive. A bud<
get is both a document and a process:
a plan or ﬁnance: and a group of
finances and a group of practises. The
budget as a plan must present pro—
posed exvendltures for all purposes
during a given period oi time and pro-
posed revenucs ior meeting those ex~
ponditures, Heretomre. legislatures—
uatlooal, stats and city—appropriated
money by many separate bills with—
out any general plan and without any
reckoning oi total hills until the end
of the fiscal year—orvlongel‘. Reven-

somc departments were starved while
others were granted lavish iavors;
money was borrawed‘ to pry current
bills and the burden placed on future
generations; huge sums disappeared
