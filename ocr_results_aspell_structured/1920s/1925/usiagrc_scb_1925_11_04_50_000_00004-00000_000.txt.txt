true

I IE probably will not tell you um clenn, nest, typewritten
work hrings heuermsrks—hnr it does—and the reason is

envious. it relieves him ct that

tedious task of deciphering

too, you'll ﬁnd the New Remington Pormhle a great time-saver
in Compiling notes and keeping up with your correspondence.

Students preler the New Remington Portable because it is
the lightest, smallest, and most compa’ct oi all standard key-
hoard ponahles. It ﬁts in a case only iouriochcs high and can
