Prof. Charles E. Rugh of the (lee
partment of education has in com
junction with other prominent educa-
tors of the West, recently completed
a sweeping investigation on the "Pres-
ent Bellavtor oi the University Under-
graduate and Why." He has some
interesting light to shed upon the
present collegiate situation. Report-
ing for the committee he offers the
following conclusions:

1. “The character of the undergrad-
uate as determined by his life before
entering college will have much to
do with his subsequent college life.
if he looks tipoii college as being a
release from restraint, the inner con-_
trol is largely lacking.

2. The possession of an auto-
m’obile by a college undergraduate is
a sowing to the winds by the parents
who present it.

3. “The curricula of the universities
are in a serious condition. We find a
willingness on the port of the student
to merely get grades, to ‘get by,’ and
to chest if need be.

4. ‘Tratemities may be helpful to
students sometimes, but are only too
often the open door for neglect of
studies and a moral slipping down-
ward.

The tlniroi Washington can
be -t of tuning one of the most disc
tinctu-c clubs, it not the only one of
its hind in existence, in the form of
Defeated Candidates club. The
only way a person can be elected to
this club is not to be elected to some
thing else.

“Before the war. the freshman Cftlnc‘

with tight trousers, louse collar, and
with no knowledge whatsoever of the

not even whispered about in the rollgh~

an automobile was looked upon as a
ulilliollzlire‘s son. That was before the
war.

"Now the freshman enters the school
much more sophisticated. His hair is'
slick, he wears the latest cut of
clothes and lacks nothing in the know—‘

Presents German View
Of Modern Jazz Band

The American iazz hand has been
criticised and commended in so many
ways that any original opinions on the
subject are a welcome relief. Follow-
ing is a German view, nuoted from
the New York Tribune:

"The man who operates the auto
horn, bells, sandpaper, cymbals and
other 'ti‘aps' in a modern jazz band
is a cross between a circus clown and
an epileptic person, in the opinion of
P. G. M. Kruse, writing in the Acht
Uhr Abendblatt.

“'Tne jazz hand,’ he continues, ‘is
the expression of the psychic structure
oi the modern human being. It typir
fies the irony of todaysthese helpless

bad that this custom should be in th
hands or the sophomore class.

6. "The domination by the ath-
letlc and social elements of the alum-
ni in the part which the alumni plays
in college affairs is another lowering
influence."

The natural reaction to this is pro-
test, but read it again, and remember
that the conclusions came neither
from the press nor the pulpit. They
are based on what purports to be
sound speculation and investigation
by those who teach us.

“THROUGH COLLEGE 01V
, PERMANENT WAVES.”

This is the title of an article ap-
pearing in the Kansas City star which
tells of the unique manner in which‘
Josephine Long of Enid, Oklahoma,
is nearing her u y through Kansas
University.

All unouenchahle desire for o uni—
versity education brought Josephine
Long to the university two years ago
with only a few dollars in her purse.
She found employment in a beauty
parlor and began worlring her way
through college. A re winonths later
she went into business for herself,

Today hfiss Long owns the largest
beauty shop in town, attends the
university regularly. owns her own
motor car, has purchased a player
piano, helps to support her family,
and is planning a trip around the
world after she receives her degree.

Five members of the faculty in the
English department of the University
of Vt’aslllngton are engaged in writing
books.
