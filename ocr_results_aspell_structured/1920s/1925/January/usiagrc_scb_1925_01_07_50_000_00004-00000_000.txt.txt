In a slow, ragged game, Wisconsin
defeated the Griunell basketball team,
29 lo 17, in the iirst game ot_the sea—
son, December 22.

Both teams showed a marked lack ot
co-ordinhtion on the oriense, and the
game was iairly even until the iinal
minutes oi play. when the Badgers,
headed by Martel, started a furious
spurt and piled up a heavy lead. The
Wisconsin center, although he did
not start the game, was the high
scorer oi both uiiintets, getting tour
iield goals, and three free throws.

him-an at forward led in the scars
ing tor the pioneers, getting two tield
goals and two free counters, with
Dofiing at the other forward position
also scoring twice irom the field, Cap.

sistent game at running guard, and at
one time startled the audience by malts
ins a pcrtect shot irom the center or
the court.

A number oi men received their first
taste or intercollegiate basketball in
this pic-season game, Dot‘fing started
the game and Chase, tot-ward, and

That a \\'d\e of financial depression
can aitcct collegiate activities in more
ways than one was discovered by
Phillip Kalar, husiness manager ot the
Grinnell Glee club, when several
towns on which he had counted [or
ellsugemeuts tailed at the eleventh
hour to sign contracts, and prevented
the club trom faking its customary
Christmas tour.

An unusually extensive trip, embrac-
ing northwestern Iowa and border ci
ies in Nebraska, South Dakota, and
Minnesota, had been tentatively scheds
uled, but the failure to get dates at
Sioux City, Sioux Falls, and Storm
Lake, as had heeh expected, led to the
abandonment ot the trip at the last
moment. The other places remaining
on the schedule were relatively so few
and tar apart that the trip could not

The cancelling ol' the Sioux City ens
segment was due to a mixiip in dates

which no one in particular is respon-

asked the club to spend two days
there, under the auspices or the
De Moldy group; but the unwitting
duplication of nel‘fo'rmzulces for
