At Chapel
This Week

Monday

In her chapel toll: Monday mornin
liliss Clara J. Andersen, Physical D
rector for Women, stressed the apnr
ciation of the beauty that appears in
everyday life,

She cited two’ or her own
incidents of her own traveling experi—
ence in order to make her meaning
clear, One was the large man who kept
his eyes glued to the rails while pass-
ing through mountain scenery, utterly
unnppreciative of nature's grandeur.
"He had eyes, yet he saw not.” ‘

Miss Andersen then told about meet-
ing a peasant woman in Norway. who
fully enjoyed the works of nature
about her. in closing her talk. she
brought the subject home to the Grin~
nell campus and laid emphasis on its
many beauties.

Trioaday

A chalk talk on the "Simple Gospel”
was the nature of T. B. Turner-'5 chall-
el address Tuesday morning.

”when we think how simple the gos—
pel is, it is strange that so many peo—
ple make it so difficult." he said. as he
drew a picture of a Pharisee who had
violated the teachings of Jesus.

lVLr. Turner continued by saying that
“There is a purpose throughout the
ages and what we want to find out is
What it is." As an example of one
who had not Caught the purpose he
drew the picture of that well known
medieval figure who gave expression
to his religious Spirit 133' standing on
top of a pillar.

The interesting and novel lecture
was concluded by an explanation of
the essence of the simple gospel.
