COTTON DIILL WAR.

From the comparative seclusion and shelter of a
college environment it is difficult for us to know of and
to fully comprehend many disturbing events which occur
in the world. Particularly is it difficult for us to obtain
perspective on existing ccndi ons in the North Carolina
mill war. But because of the numbers of people this
struggle affects both in actuality and in precedent it is
important for us to know about ltmand to form some
definite opinion.

The average earnings of a worker in the North
Carolina textile industry in 1928 were $12.23 weekly.
The average workday for this wage is twelve hours and
twenty minutes without time out for meals.

The first revolt against such as system came last
April when the hands at the Loray mill in Gastonia
walked out.

in June, majef Aderholt was killed while entering
the strikers’ prqpex‘ty Without a warrant. Although no
one has the slightest idea who fired the shot the authori-
lies arrested sixty workers and held sixteen without
hall for ﬁrst degree murder. Tricnrst trial was ruled out
when one juror :becal‘ne linsalle .imd thefore time for the

on Septemherdth, a mob, yelling, “Long live 100%
Americanism," raided .uhion headquarters, kidnapped
and flogged three men, surrounded the Charlotte jail and

jury convicted these men on their beliefs since they
brought in a. blanket verdict which found all defendants

guilty of all charges without discrimination. Evidence

against some on some charges was not even given. But

it was a jury of fundamentalist farmers saturated with

untrlahor prejudice, probably the most conspicuous anti-

lahor group in a community where such a feeling is very'
erong.

Agitation in Marion has also led to violence and'
massacre. The Marion mill owned by B. w. Baldwin
has a had reputation. In 1928 the average salary was
less than $11.00 a week. Until the recent strike women
earned its little as $5.00 and no skilled labor ever reached
over $21.00.

July llih the workers prcscntcd a request to
Baldwin asking whether he would reduce the work shift
to ten hours without a reduction of wages; whether he
would take back twenty-two workers ﬁred for union
activity; whether he was willing to meet a committee of
employees to take up grievances. The answer wlls
”No...

That day the workers walked out on a strike that
lasted exactly two months. It was settled by the medi-
ation of the governor and allowed a fifty-five hour week,
the same pay per hour, and permitted Baldwin to refuse
to l'eemploy fourteen active strikers. Two weeks later
Baldwin raised wages ﬁve per cent hut refused to re-
cmploy loz former employees.

Aware that another strike was imminent Baldwin
returned to Marion and during the night shift October
lst summoned Sheriff Adkins and several deputies.
Scenes in the plant that night, it is testified, were a
provocation to violence. Dared to quit, the workers
walked out and waited six hours at the mill gate to
tell the day shift. At 7:30 Sheriff Adkins exploded
tear gas in the crowd of unarmed strikers. A lame
man who attacked the sheriff with his cane was shot
by a deputy. The crowd ran and was shot at by
Sheriff Adkins, Superintendent Hunt and three foreman.
All the victims were shot in the back.

The arrest of the officers on the charge of second
degree murder was countered with Sheriff Adkins’ arrest
of thirtyrtwo strikers on the charge of conspiracy and
rebellion. Judge Harding later released Adkins, Hunt,
and Foremen Snoddy and Smith. The others are held
under hond. Governor Gardner. himself a min owner and
in whose plnrit conditions are said to be hotter than any-
where in ﬁle south, is deeply moved by the tragedy but
under the laws of North Carolina he is almost powerless.
He cannot comply with the request of the labor federa-
tion .to investigate the character and record «of the depu—
ties, to determine if Baldwin violated his agreement,
and to make an investigation of the. conditions and ﬁnan~
cial status 'of the mill,

A little hefore the Marion massacre occurred one
of the most outstandlng events .of this struggle. Ella
May Wiggins,‘ba‘llad makerfor the union, employed sixty
hours a :wee‘k for .s ’00, was murdered September lath
when officialsflred‘ nto a‘bnnd or unarmed workers on

tion. Elias explanation sounds like anything but the

Mclntire fumbled on his own 30 yard
line. A pass, McCllSkey to Hacklcr.
was good but failed to gain. Anoth-
er toss to Miller stopped at the ten
yard line and there the Pioneers
held. An incomplete pass over the
goal gavc Grinnell the ball on the 20-
yard mark.

Following another exchange of
kicks Christoffersen intercepted MC—
Cuskey‘s pass on the so yard line as
the quarter ended.

Rose Makes Touchdown

With the opening of the final
chapter the Pioneers started their
drive down the field for the final
touchdown. Rose slipped off the left
side of the line for five yards and
then cracked center for three more.
He hit center again and went six
yards and once more drove into the
same spot for four yards. Ruff
made three at left tackle and Liedtke
made three at right tackle. Ruff
passed to Bilto who showed some
nice running to advance 25 yards.
Rose made six at center and Ruff
took four yards at right tackle. on
a triple pass play Rose went across
the line but steppcd out of bounds on
the one foot line. He drove over on
the next play, however. Ruff’s kick
was good for a. third time.

Coach Watt then substituted frec-
ly, the game ending with Teachers
in possession of the hall near mid-
field.

The entire Grinnell team function-
ed up to top form and showed the axe
parts just why it is undefeated in
the Missouri Valley conference. Rose.
Ruff, McIntire, Christcffersen and
Bilto played particularly good
games.

Captain McCluskey, Heckler and
Klinoff were the chief stars for the
visitors.
