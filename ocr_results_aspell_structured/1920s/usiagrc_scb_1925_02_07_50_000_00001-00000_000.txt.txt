Students Welcome Tea
In “Waterloo" Week

The inauguration of a new custom
was observed during semester exam
week. when the Y. W. C. A. served tea
to students on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday afternoons between four
and ﬁve-thirty as a relief mm: the
arduous ordeal of semester examina-
tions. Judging from the numbers of
those who flocked to the Association
building to partake of the liquid r
freshments the innovation was quite
successful and will undoubtedly be
carried out at all future exam periods.
Despite the fact that women predomi-
nated there were a conslderallle numr
her of men who came and indulged lll
chats after tea, The plan is com-
mendable as a relief from the worries
of examinations.

{ll‘illlll-ll Quintet til Play Nebrilslill, K.
U.. Kilnsus Aggics, lllld Oklnllollm
by Next Frilllly.

Grinell faces what promises to be
her mos tstrenuons week of basketball
when the Scarlet and Black cagers
meet Nebraska, the kansas Aegies and
Kansas university on February 9. 10.
11, respectively on a. southern trip,
and then return to a same here with
Oklahoma the thirteenth. These teams.
with exception of Oklahoma, all stand
above Grinncll in the percentage col-
umn and none of the games are assur-
ed as yet, either way.

Kansas is leading the Valley with
five won and one lost and this game
will undoubtedly be the hardest on the
list. The Pioneers hold a 25 ti) 24
Win over the Kansas Aggies who in
turn were victorious over Kansas, but
comparative Scores mean little and all
reports seem to lead to the belief that
the Aggies were playing considerably
over their heads in this game. Ack—
erman, Kansas captain and star for-
ward is now in second place in the
scoring column and with his team~
mate, Peterson undoubtedly form the
greatest offensive machine in the Val-
ley, Needless to mention they are
ably assisted by the remaining three
as Kansas employs a five man offense.
In the gune with the layhawks on the
home floor, Grinnell took the short
end of a 3946 score.

Nebraska’s Strength Unknown

Nebraska, with when: the first game
is to be played, is more or less of an
unknown quantity in this part of the
country but judging from the games

NllllMAN ANGELL WILL

‘Nobed English Economist and Pill)-
hoist Will Appear on College
Lectlue Course.

l Norman Angeli, noted erltlsh econ-
omist and publicist, now touring this

students in Herrick Chapel, Monday
evening at 8 o'clock on the great social
movement now developing in Europe,
and more particularly the effects of n
Labor administration upon English so—
ciety and government.

Mr. Angeli stands out as one of the
greatest political writers of modern
times. His many books on economics
and politics, subjects popularly con-
sidered dry and uninteresting. have
had extraordinary sales. “The Great
Illuslon,” probably his best known
work, has sold nearly half a million
copies, and has been translated into
twenty-five languages.

Having spent a large part of his
youth in this country, Angeli is emin-
ently fitted to address an American
audience. He was educated in France
and Switzerland, and in recent years.
has been in intimate touch with those
who form the present British govern-
ment. He was for many years, asso-
ciatcd in business with land North—
cliffe, was a close friend of Stanley
Baldwin, and at a later date with Sir
Richard Gal-ton, Lord bailout», and
Lord Esher. founder of the carton

1325 BYGLﬂNE ElAFF
lNNﬂUNﬂES PHEIEHESS

Baldwin Being nged For Subp-
shots; Safe Return of Piotr-res
Not Used Guaranteed.

W‘lth considerable material already
in the hands of the publishers, the
1926 Cyclone is fast assuming the
proportions of a real book. Most of

the organization pictures have been
taken as well as the dormitory and
quadrangle groups. The faculty
pictures have been completed and a
large proportion of the campus scenes
are now receiving their final touches,

The cover selected is a masterpiece,
quite simple in design but very im-
pressive and effective, an excellent
dellneotor of the theme of the book.
The border design. the work of Roger
sudlong, ’22, is exceptionally attract-
ive and is also thoroughly indicative
of "Pioneer Personalities." Some
clever art work by Isabel Stuart, ‘26,
and Pauline Crook, '27, already in the
hands of the editor, portends the high
quality of the art department. All
in all. despite the unusual amount of
hard luck this year, the board has been
concentrating its efforts towards the
greatest of all cyclones, and present
indications are favorable for such an
attainment.

Want Marc Snapshots

A drive is now being made to obtain
more kodnk pictures. There seems
to he a general shortage in that re-
spect and everybody is urged to una
hesitatingly turn in to the members of
the staff, any pictures which might be
of use. The board would greatly ap-
preciate prompt action ill so doing.
Any pictures not used are guaranteed
safe return to donors.

On March 9, the Cyclone board is
offering the students the unique priv-
ilege of seeing themselves as others
see them. The paddle parade at the
golf links, the class scrap, the exodus
to Drake, and the Drake game are all
included in the cinema feature as
well as a special picture. More de-
tails will be published later concern
ing the exact program.

MORAN LEADS IN SCORING

Kansas Aggles Arc Unable h) Stop The
Lightning Offense or Pioneers in
Lust Half of Game.

Uncorking a whirlwind offense in
the second half that ran the Aggies off

their feet for a la wminntes, Grinncil
upset the dope and beat the Kansas
Aggies 25 to 24, in a fast game last
Saturday llight.

Bunker, the ace of the Wildcat team.
was held to two baskets and four free
throws, while Moran, despite the fact
that he had two men watching him
continually, was highrpoint man of
the game with four baskets and a pair
of free tosses.

Both teams missed numerous shots
at the basket, and the Aggies were
especially unfortunate in hitting the
loop in the second half. The guard-
ing of the Pioneers Was consistent
throughout the game. and time after
time, the Aggie offense was broken up
before it was well started,

Boga Begins Scoring

Boga began the scoring a few min-
utes after the game started with 9.
beautiful field goal from near the cent-
er of the floor. The Aggies then got
under Way, and Bunker made two bas<
kets followed by a. pair of free throws,
before Grinnell again counted. Gal»
Vin made a free throw, and Moran
started things for the Pioneers by
tlpplng one in, and immediately after-
wards nabbing the tip-off and drib-
bllng through the Aggie guards for a.
perfect goal that gave Grlnnell the lead.
1 to 6, A free throw by Winter added
another point. and Byers retaliated by
shootln a. perfect goal from the side.
Weddle added another. and Gelv‘ln
again tied the score. Tebow was sent
in for Weddle and be tipped in the
basket that gave the Wildcats a 12 lo
10 lead as the half ended.

Pioneer Offense Good

From the initial tip-off in the second
period. the Pioneer offense worked
with lightning rapidity. and the Scar-
let cagers made four baskets in less
than three minutes. This gave Grin-
nell a lead that the visiting team was
never able to overcome, although stalk
ing nearly cost the Pioneers the game
in the last few minutes. The score
stand 25 to 18, and Tehow added a.
pair of field goals in rapid succession.
“lith a minute left to play, Chase com-
mitted a foul underneath his own goal,
and Bunk/er made both Shots good. but
tile Pioneers got the next tipvoff and
managed to keep the ball until the
grill was fired.

Moran and Captain Gelvill were the
stellar performers for the Scarlet ilnd
Black team, although Chase (00, play-
ed a. fine floor game. Tchnw and Buuk<
er lucked best for the Wildcats.
