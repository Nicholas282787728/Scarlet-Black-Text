B)" “B01” Norris

This has been a tough year for the
so-colled tooth-all experts. Each week
has seen an increasing number of tav-
orites go down in defeat at the hands
of opponents whom it was widely her-
alded they would trounce right royal-
ly. and each week the football expert
has expected his pay envelope to be
his lost.

The situation has become so route
that even the most expert of experts
hesitate to pick anybody but Notre
Dame, the Army or the Navy to win,
and either Harvard or role to lose, but
even last week those who placed the
Army right side up in their dope
bucket, fell by the wayside.

Nor has the Missouri Valley confer-
ence been immune from frequent ate
tacks of the malady. it is safe to say
that there was more money lost on

Oklahoma last week than there is on

“sure tips." at the race, when in honor
of the signing of the Armistice, the
cellar»musty Kansas Jayliawks adopt-
ed the famous Verdun motto of “They

homa Sooner-s in an earned victory,1o

The only Valley teams that ran true

possibility of a~tie for the title. and

booked for this week end, and one
more for Thanksgiving. The Kansas
Acgies should have an easy time des
fcating Amos, and Bert Clark should
increase his lead on the top rung oi
the league scoring ladder when Mis-
souri plays Kansas, but if the Jay-
liawks run out of turn like they did
last Thursday, anything may happen.

Drake plays Notre Dame at Smith

there was plenty of fast pliiying in
