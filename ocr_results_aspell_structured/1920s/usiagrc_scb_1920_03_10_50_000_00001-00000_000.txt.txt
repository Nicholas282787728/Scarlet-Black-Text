are battling Carleton, a negative team
composed of Harry Barnes, Ronald
Boehmier, and Linn Smith will go to
Mt. Vernon to debate the some ques-
tion with Cornell there.

The question tor debate is an im—
portant one, and is rapidly becoming a
topic of general, discussion. Now that
the railroads have been returned to
private ownership, it is especially

_necessary that some deﬁnite plan ior
corporation regulation be adopted. The
aim of these debates is to help crys-
talllze public opinion as to some of
the available forms or such control,

particularly that of compulsory arbi—
tration as applied to public service
corporations.

Owing to the unsettled conditions
last year, no inter-collegiate debates

pearance or a Grinnell team before the

team journeyed to Northﬁeld to meet
Carleton, whlle Cornell appeared here

Enthusiastically.‘

»\ concert by tile Grinneii College
Orchestra with Wanda Eells as pianist
was

was probably the best oi its kind
given iu recent years, was entllus
iastically received by the large audi-
ence which was in attendance.

Miss Eclls, an instructor in the
orchestra, played "Symphonic Variar
ticns, by Franck, and an "E that Con—
certo No. 1," by Liszt.

Miss Eelis plays with a wonderiul
poise and shows a keen appreciation
for the musical content oi the come
position.

Tile "Concerto," by Liszt, was probe
ably the more brilliant ot the two
numbers, In this Miss Dells showed
remarkable technique and musician-
ship.

The orcbcstra artistically interpret—
ed three movements of Well-known
symphonies, "Allegro from Symphony
No. x, in 13 minor,” by Schubert, and
"Larghetto and Scherzo from Symph-
ony No. 2, in D Major," by Beetliovan.

This is the ﬁrst time this year that
the Grinnell College Orchestra has
been heard alone in concert.

Due to the efforts of director Prof.
G. l.. Pierce, the orchestra was well
balanced. The tune coloring, due to
individual ability, was the marked
feature of the orchestra's splendid in-
tcrnretations.

Iowa College Has No
Studies For Freshmen

The existence of one college in iowa
which has no study of Freshman rank
in its curriculum, and another whose
endowment consists solely of a thou—
sand dollar bond in a cement iactory
are examples of the revelations which
the educational survey or the inter—
Church World Movement is bringing
forth. Professor E. B. T. Spencer,
who is aiding in the survey, described
its objects and methods of work in
chapel on Tuesday morning.

The Inter-Church Movement was
organized shortly after the signing of
the armistice and now has the co—opcr-
ation of practically every denomina—
tion in the country. The purpose of
the movement is to make a detailed
survey of the world irom the religious
and educational standpoint, for the
purpose of exerting a greater infill-
cnee in the world through'coopcrativc
effort toward theeconoiny of men and
means.

The Movement secured a three—mil-
liourdollar credit for the making of
the survey alone, which is involving
the work of about 50,000 people. Over
a billion and a quarter has been put
at their disposal, a iourth of which
has been assigned to educational work.
Although the Movcnicntmasthc coop-
cration or the churches as its aim, it is
in no, way intended to cifcct an organic
union of the various denominations.

Discusses Relation
0f Miracles to God

Asserting that we arc as little chil-
dren its far as a thinking religion is
concerned, Mr. H. L. Haywood con-
demned the association of God only
with superaturdl miraclcs as 2!. form of
nature fear, at Vespers Sunday after-
noon. Thc realization of the vastness
of the universe should not shake our
faith in God‘s interest in us as indi-
viduals, in his opinion. God's infinite
power is easily able to control the
universe, however Vztst it is, and to
maintain a personal knowledge and
concern for the life of every individ»
uul. .
