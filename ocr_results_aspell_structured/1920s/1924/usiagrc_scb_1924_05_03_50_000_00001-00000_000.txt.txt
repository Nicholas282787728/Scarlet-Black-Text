A FRﬂM‘THE GRITIB‘S CHAIR , I

With the coming of spring the critic
revels in poshmol’tems. The obsequies
for the string quartet season are
pleasant duties in our case. The
Grinch String quartet played its last
concert Friday evening in Herrick
chapel to a speculative audience,

in its effort to popularire chamber
music within our borders, the Grit-h
neil Quartet has been fairly success-
ful, Despite programs of considerable
excellence the general public still re-
mains rather apathetic. Fortunately,
this lack of appreciation has not di-
minishcd the ardor of the playcrs.
With remarkable persistence they
have come back. each time with an
improved ensemble and a new pro-
gram. As yet they have given us
little of the modems; but of Beetho—
vcn, Mozart, and Hayden there has
been plenty, and it htt’s been ycll play-
ed,

Last night’s program included a
Haydcn quartet, evenly played; Truth»
ing in the performance calculated to
arouse enormous enthusiasm. Two
movements op. quartet by Rimskys
Karsokow were wcll executed.

The climax of the evening came in
Cesar Frank's quintet for piano and
string quartet. We have heard the
quintet when it was nothing more
than a thing of muscular proportions
and flat tonality. Last night's per—
fomlomle gave us rare pleasure, There
was technical range and poetic vision;
above all there was humanity. Shades
of feeling depths of altitude and pose
sion wcrc explored. The local Hr»
tists worhcd wondc s with Frank's
sinister music. '
