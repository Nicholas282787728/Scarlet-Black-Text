“Drake Game Sometime
Before Jan. 22”*Huff

Although no definite date had been
set by noon today for the game with
Drake here, which would have been
played yesterday if it had not been
postponed by Bulldog authorities,
“Doc" Huff announced this mor-
ning, that the Blue and White quintet
will appear here sometime before Jan-
uary 22. - .

whenever it is player], it promises to
be one of the most stubbornly con-
tested trays that will be seen on the
local court Drake and Grlnnell are
rivals of long standing and the Plon-
cers have a recent football defeat to
avenge.

Clark-Dibble Game-
IS Declared to Be
a Draw by Rogers

The disputed interdormitory ba -
ketball game between Clark and Di —
hle halls, caused by the referee al—
lowing the wrong team to shoot a
free throw in the game Saturday, has
been declared a tie contest by Mr. R
w. Rogers of the physical training
department.

After a careful examination of the
rule book. it was found that there was
no ruling on such a mistake and,
therefore the disputed point will not
be counted, and the score reverts to
an 3 and 3 tie.

Since the schedule has been made
out. and cannot be changed, this game
will be played off when the remainder
of the series is over.

In a fast game featuring closc
guarding, thc Pioneers were nosed
out by Allies Saturday, 18 to ll, in,

territory.

Captain Benz, although unable to
score a single field goal, due, to the
close guarding of Roberts, Cyclone
captain, was high point man for the
Pioneers, scoring six points by way of
the free throw route. “Riff" Raff was
the most consistent scorer of thc game
With three field goals and two free
throws to his credit.

Pioneers star-o nil-st

The Picnerrs grabbed an early lead
when Galvin dl'ibblell the full length
of the floor for a basket, followed by
a free throw by Benz, before the Cy~
clones were able to get started. Raff
then made two field goals, and Fisher
:3. free throw, giving Ames the lead
which they maintained throughout
the entire contest.

At the end of the half, Amcs was
leading 13 to s. Grinnell came back
strong in the second half, and out-
pointed the Cyclones, s to 5, but were
unable to overcome such a large lead.

Ames Guards Closely

Grinnell’s fiyo sacrificed many
chances for shots from about twenty
feet, in efforts to get closer to the bus»
lret, and the trials were made unsuc<
cessful by the excellent defensive
game of Young and Roberts. Critchctt
created a sensation when he made
a unearth overhead shot for a goal,
and Winter played his usual good
game at back guard. Close refcrceing
also featured the game, Boge and Rob-
erts being put on the bench for per-

TRITAADADER’S TARDE

“What Can’t Money Buy” Ap-
pears to Be Minhmdker—
Two Others Scheduled.

Although Rockefeller may be the
only one able to afford stomach
transplantation, everyone may witness
the effects of this type of operation at
the second Dramatic composition
class y program Saturday evening.
Janua 19.

"What 0311’: Money Buy?," a Sam-L
cal farce by Prof. W. n. Trumbaucr
hinges on this famous, butjnfrequent
operatiou. The results of installing
an Irish bod—carrier's “Little Mary"
on the inside of a dyspeptic million-
aire are complicated and amusing.
Both the. plutocrat and the proletariat
get more than they bargained for,
but then, "what can't money buy?"

The other two ouevact dramas to be
staged Saturday evening are "Two
Crooks and a Lady" by Eugene Pillotr
and “The Gaol Gate" by Lady Greg-
ory. NO one of the three is a star play,
and this division of action among the
different members of all three costs
has necessitated an unusually large
number of rchersals.

This play program will be present-
’cd in A. R. H. auditorium, at eight
o’clock, January 19.

DDMATETTSE THURSDAY

Plans Are Made to Poll the Vote
of Quadrangle and Dorms at
Dinner Tomorrow,

EVERY MEDIUM IS USED
TO REACH THE VOTERS

Vote of ,the College on Peace Plan
Will Be Annoued in S. at B.
On Saturday.

A whirlwind campaign to determine
the attitude of Grinnell students on
the Bok peace plan will be opened up
morrow by the committee in charge
of the plebiscite for Crinncll. Polls
will be taken in the Dormitory and
Quadrangle dining rooms at dinner
and a voting station will be kept on-
eu all day in the A. R. H. reading room
for those who could not be ,rcachcd
through either of these mediums.
Use All Means

An especial effort is being made to
get out a vote which will be' really
representative of the opinion of the
whole school and for this reason ev—
ery availible means will be used to
give each student an opportunity to
cast his vote either for or against the
plan as he individually sees fit. A
ballot box will be kept open in the
book store for thc remainder Df'the
week so that those who were not
reached by the first drive may have
a chance to register their vote befoxe
the end of the campaign. .

Last night pamphlets containing a
brief summary of the plan and also in
full force were distributed throughout
the Quadrangle and the Dormitory,
and to the faculty through the fac— ,
ulty exchange. This will give every— 1
one two days to read the plan and de—
termine which way he will cast his
vote. Then tomorrow ballots will be}
furnished at the dining rooms and in
the reading room. and the results tabu-
lated. '

Simultaneously with the college
vote a similar referendum w ill be tak-
en in the town through the medium of
the ‘tcwn papers. Each paper is
printing the ballot and running a
special Bok Peace department during
the duration of the campaign

Results of the vote will be kept
checked up to date mill the results
published in every i ‘ e of each pa.-
per. Saturday's Scarlet and Black
will contain practically the final vote
of the college but the town campaign ‘
will be kept up a little longer due to
the difficulty of reaching the individ-
ual voters.

Are All Eligible

It is not necessary to be a legal vot»
or to cast a ballot although that ques—
tion is asked on the ballot for the pur-
pose of information, Any individual
opinions of the Subject Will be wel-
comed and should be addressed to the
Belt Peace ’edltof- of the Scarlet and
Black ‘

This great national referendum is
being given wide publicity throughout
the country and public organizations
of an kinds are co—operating to make
it a success. The Des Moines Reg—
ister has the largest Iowa vote so
far. Its figures showed 1,604 for
the plan to 57 against in yesterdays ls-
sue.

Scarlet and Bloch is publishing a
ballot in this issue for the use of town
and out-of—town subscribers and any
dormitory and Quadrangle residents
who do not receive a ballot from the
English Speaking Union. .

BAND NOTICE

The last attempt to get
enough men together to have a
bond rehearsal will take place
Thursday evening, at 7:15. If
enough men are out at that time
to wunrdnt the continuation of
rehearsals, one more attempt
will be made to build up a band.

If mod. the matter will ”he
dropped until there is some
interest shown in and for a.
band, and until those in charge
have some reason to believe
that there is at least a. possi-
bility of having is. successful
