What Do You Think?

To the Editor Scarlet and Black.

when Upton sinclair came forth
with “The Goose Step" we hailed him
as an exaggerator of the subject. hut
the Goose step has come to Grinneli.
Grinnell is an institution of higher
learning, loved by some, desecrated
Time after time, we so
to hapel and come out thinking that
ci tion has been of advantage.
Time after time we are told to think
as cosmopolitan and not us Grinnell-
inns. ‘V‘e are here to study primarily
—but‘ we do not know ii. We are

of a freshman, either because he is
brazen and bold or because he does
not care to make a tool of himself,
reluses to march in a pajama parade
and refuses to wear a silly cop, we
revert to the primitive.

Will wearing a red cap make that
Freshman ct statesman or the best of
citizens? There are null—conforming
people who cannot follow the mob.
is the mob iustilied iu punishing a
noirconformist?

Conforming is not the only virtue.
There is virtue in showing a group

‘of insolent upper classmen that they
litre not gods, that there are other

opinions as supremo as their own.

Griuuell is not bl'olnidic, Grinncll
is a school in which sulphides find
food ior sulphidic thought and action.

After all is a pajama parade such
an ex 'zlul'ilinilry fine tradition. 1s
vulgarity adorning statues such a high
form of humor? And is beating

i freshmen ior not wearing red caps, en~

cuul‘aging knowledge? Such actions
are no less than despicable, and there
is a blot on Grillllell's name that her
dignity will do well to elfitcn.

There may be more ways than one
of DXDI‘ ng the [act that one is
non-conformlst: some ways
are better than others. but hasn't
cvciy stlldentl oi Griunell college the
right to his own Opi inn? There is
no one who needs givc up his liberty
it he does not, in keeping his own,
deprive another of his freedom.

There (ire those who belong to lhl's

Gl'innell College—Who love the cum
puylhe building and the spirit that
‘pcrrneates them. There are those
who count it a personal blow when
the beauty that is Grinnell's is defac-
,eu—whemer that beauty be in the
form of a tree m' a statue.

Giinnell belongs to the human ele-
ment surely more than to the brute
‘clcment but we may be mistaken.

Heaven help us if the mob—thought
and the moh»spirit is to dominate
Grinnell individualism.

Very truly yours
