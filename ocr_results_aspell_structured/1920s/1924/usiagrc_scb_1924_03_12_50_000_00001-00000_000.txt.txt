Quadites Delighted by
Sunday Night Musicale

————

The musicale given Sunday evening
after lunch in the Quadrangle draw-
ing room by Mrs. c. N. Smiley, pianist,
Mrs. Earl D. Strong, violinist, and
Mrs. E. B. T. Spencer, soprano, was
one of the loveliest occasions of the
Year.

Each selection called for an encore
which the musicians very graciously
accepted.

Mrs. Strong's violin solo, "nullanzn
Bailaton" hy Hubay was greatly en~
joyed and Mrs. Spencer's interpreta-
tion "is Infant Parodigue" by Debussy
was especially pleasing.

Mrs. Smiley deserves a great deal
of praise not only for her delightful
solos, but also for her unhrlng as-
sistance as accompanist,

Extensive investigation was carried
out by the student Council committed
before the petition was forwarded to
the faculty for action. Finding that,
lwhile a few universities give some

great number of the smaller schools
offer no inducement for interest in the

step forward among the smaller
schools in ofiering this inducement to

Led the Valley in Free Throws,
Making Seventy»Six Out of
One Hundred Chances.

The close oi the lssuuri Valley
basketball season has brought to Fred
Benz, Pioneer captain, the unusual
distinction of being the first Grinne'll
man to ever lead the conference in
scoring.

The star Pioneer forward playing
his last year under Scarlet and Black
colors, accounted for 152 points,
enough to enable him to top a large
ﬁeld of valley cagers in the scoring
column. In the four years that he
has played for Griuuell Benz has al-
ways been a consistent performer, and
his name has milked hear the head in
the individual standings. This year’s
feat or showing his heels to the best
of the mid-west basketeers is a ﬁtting
climax to his successful career as a
Pioneer athlete.

.ivoragc 9.5 Points.

in the sixteen valley games in
which the Gl'lunell leader competed
he scored an average of 9.5 points per
game. This high average was partly
due to his exceptional ability in caelng
free throws, for out of a hundred at-
tempts from the toul line, Benz was
successful in 76. He also scored as
baskets from afield tor a total of sev—
enty. x points by that method.

One unusual feature in the race for
individual honors was the close‘ﬁuish
among the leaders. Buelter was but

on Benz's trail with us, but only two
points above McBride, the Oklahoma
star. Ackerman of Kansas was fourth
with 141, but there was a drop of
twenty points to fifth place which was
held by, Bunker of the Kansas Agies.
Eoge, Grinnell center, accounted for
70 and was twenty-ﬁfth in a list of

a brand of basketball well worth wat-
