“Last \Vednesdﬂy was one of the
numerous Turkish holidays; conse-
quently the college Closed its doors,
As is usual on sllch fellve days, three
of us planned a hike, this one being
to Anatole Finale, which is at the
exit of the Black Sea into the Bus-
photons on the Asiatic side. First, I
shnll introduce the! members or the
party. Foremost among the group
comes Dr. Terzaghi, a Czecho-Slov»
akian. formerly a high ofiiccr in the
Austrian army, and all in all an ex-
ceedingly brilliant mining engines,
age 41. Next comes Kerchdjian. an
Armenian who is an assistant in the
engineering school here. He is avnativu
of Turkey, and naturally speaks the
native tongue fluently,

“We started from the college lit ten
o'clock in a ferry which took us
across the Bosphomus to Beikns, a
lairly good sized Turkish Village,
From Beikos we started to hike to
Finare by a roundabout path over the
hills, TWO hours oi walking in very
pleasant surroundings brought us to
Finare. Where we found a coffee
house. and we suceedcd to eat our
lunch, consisting of bread. cheese,
eggs, figs, and helvar, an intrigulng
Turkish sweet. After completing our
countrllied collation \Ve moundeled
down the street to the point where the
light house stands. encroaching it,
we were stopped by a gendar‘me,
Turkish soldier. who asked us for our
papers of evidence. TVell, we were
humiliated beyond compare, for none
of us had the slightest bit or indentifi~
Cation with us. “Kil‘ch” told him that
We were teachers in Robert College,
which is usually sufficient for the
most incredulous. By this time the
dialogue had emerged into i! mob
scene, in which most or the villagers
were parti lpzttirlg. Everyone, with
the exception of the gendnrme, who
we later learned to he a silly ass, was
satisfied that we were who we claim—
ed to be, 'but no matter. 'iVe had to see
the Commandant of the Gendal‘merie
who was located at Pumas, about a
half hour’s walk down the side of the
Bosnhorous. So off we started, one
gendarme leading, we three following,
and a second gendarme bringing up
the rear. The humor of it wits all
pretty near too much. but in spite of
our laughter We finally reached Po-
reos, and we prepared to meet our
fate. “'e were conducted into the of-
fice, itnd immediately the commands

that he could do nothing tar as, in

you begin to appreciate our predica-
nient.

"One gendarme had no idea
whatever of where to go. and the
otben had been over the general way
once before. And there we were at
the mercy of that pair. First we en»
countered a jungle. and alter emerg.‘
ing from that We had torn our
clothes. socks were in shreds, our
legs were soaked (we had fallen in
creeks twice), and our hands and
faces were scratched and bleeding.
Two more hours of hiking over hills,
on which we turned our ankles, slip-
ped on rocks. and what not, brought
us to the top or the last hill, from
which we could see nothing but two
huge bun—fires, and hear the beating
of drums. That completed the picture.
What better idea of our execution
could we have had than that? We
were told that they were celebrating
a feast in the village. I could not help
but reﬂect what excellent porridge we
three would make. After our descent
ot the hill we reached the confines of
Arnaooutkeuy, and we immediately
went to the milimry headquarters.
There the officer in charge was an
extremely handsome chap, who as~'
sured us that he could fix us out. He'
set to work to make out a great long
credential for each or us, after which
he invited us to enjoy the comforts of
a worm fire (for we were hitter cold) '
and his tobacco. soon after. we unit

house where we ordered some or the
national beverage, Turkish colfec

around the faces of those present, and
without a word found a seat in some

was filled with interesting faces and‘
costumes, and I fairly revelled in the
scene.

We inquired as to a place in
which to sleep, and the floor of. the
bakery was offered. which had the
unique advantage of being warm,

so we accepted. 0n reaching the spot.
we found a foul-smelling, dirty. old
room in which bread was made by
day. and tramps slept by night when
occasion demanded. An amiable fol-
low brought us some blankets which
