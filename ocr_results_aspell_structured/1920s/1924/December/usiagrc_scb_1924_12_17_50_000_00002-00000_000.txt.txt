multitude of lest minute duties, end
it's only how and then, in the midst
of the flurry of exams and packing,
that we get a whiff of the spirit of
Christmas.

lifter all, what is the spirit of
Christmas? What does Christmas
mean to yuu? Red and green wreaths
of holly and mistletoe in lighted win—
down? show crunching underfoot,
"shaking out laughter on the air?”

Or a. pile of useless presents beneath
a glittering Christmas tree? A hand—
ln every mail? A frenzied round oi
holiday parties,

Do we ever let Christmas suggest to
us the spirit of Christ himself?

We've heard a good deal these last
few years about Christ in business,
Christ in politics—even in religion:
Great men are advocating that policy.
What if there’s something in it, after
all?

it. And we spend a. good deal of
time nowadays being proud of it. We
spend a good deal of energy trying to
make Grinncll a better place in which
to live and grow. Are we so busy
with our vitrious “problems," hustling
here and there in helpless panic, that
we sometimes forget the great unlvor.
sol personality that must underlie all
our activities?

Grinnell has made its reputation as
a christian college. The inevitable
group of students who proudly believe
in "nothiu' nor nohody" have little in-

ﬂuence. And yet, there‘s a tendency

'on the part of both students and fails

ulty to veer cautiously, uncarnouflag—
ed i’eligion. Possibly the faculty
think the students won‘t stand for it,
We may be wrong, but we’re inclined
to agree with the student speaker who
believes that the chapel service, at
least, might be a period of “spiritual
relaxation."

We‘re not advocating the shouting
type of evangelism. We’re merely re—
membering the old story of how "she
laid Him in a manger, because there
was no room {or them at the inn." We-
're merely wondering if we have room

for Him in Grinnell.

The little boys who are living over
at the men’s dormitories this year
haven‘t anything to do but play with
the herd book and the names of their
girl friends. It does seem too bad,
doesn’t it? Wouldn't somebody like
to buy them a new set of toys l . .
something less perishable?

The _other day a prominent member
of the Dramatic club accused us of

be everybody doesn't always read this
