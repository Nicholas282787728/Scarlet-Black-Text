Roosevelt High of Des Moines,
Doped to Place High in
Both Tournaments

Although min this morning caused
a slighc delay in the Intel-scholastic
tennis tournament this afternoon, the
courts are sufficiently dry to con-
tlnus the matches this afternoon, and
it is expected that the tournament will
be over before dark.

The singles were startcd on the
Country club and college courts this
morning at nine o'clock, and will conv
tinlle until about the middle of the af-
ternoon, and the doubles will follow
Immediately afterward. The dope
gives Roosevelt, High of Des Moines,
and University high of Iowa City the
best chalice to win, although not much
is known of the individual playing
of either team, and a dark horse may
easily cop the meet.

The golf matches will start at the
Country club this alternatin, as the
rain has made little difiercuce in the
shape or the greens. Roosevelt is
also tarot-ad to take tllls tournament,
but Grinpcll has two good golfers in
Hamilton and Slllley, and will give
Roosevelt high a good rccs

“The White Sister”

Regarding “The White Sister,"
which appears at the Colonial theater
soon, E. W. Virden sends the fol-
lowing letlcr to Manager L. C. \Vcst:

I considcr_"Thc White Sistel" thc
ﬁnest picture I have ever seen not ex-
cepting "Tho Covered \Vgon,” or “The
Ten Commandments," which I saw in
Hollywood, in all its glory.
>Froln every standpoint, it seems to
me shovc criticism. It you
beauty of photography, you have it;
story, you have it; if you must have
‘thrills, you certainly get them in the
eruption of Vesuvius find the terror
that follows; and host oi all, if you
want really great art in acting you
will surely be satisﬁed. Miss Gish
proves herself u really great actress,
curd Robert Coleman ranks not inf be
low her.

In the scene where the “White Sise
ter." feeling at last her own strength
to resist her lover,
takes up her rosary.
and leaning motionless, against
the door, counts her bends
over and Over, one thinks of Warﬁeltl
in "The Music Master." You remem-
ber, he sits motionless for minutes,
looking at the miniature in his hand,
and so “puts across" his feeling, that
the Whole house creeps. Miss Gish
does the same quiet intense acting,
and there Were few dry eyes during the
scene. iMrS. E. W Virden
