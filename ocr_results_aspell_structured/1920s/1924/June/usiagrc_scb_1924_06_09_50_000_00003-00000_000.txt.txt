You may call to mind that on one
occasion Jesus went with his disciples
through the corn ﬁelds on the Saab»

learned in the law and the traditions,
he plucked the ears of corn and did
eat, both he and his disciples. And
in reply m the rebuke of those who
were looking on he gave this startling

heard did not understand.

Jesus is a safe interpreter as a. life

were in come among you today, in
quest of disciples, that he wouldn't ask
any questions at all. He would say
very much as he did to the fishermen

we if we hope to win something of the
distinction at his life in our common-

Galilee illustrates the simplicity of the
whole scheme of lilc.

He is interested ﬁrst of all in your

was the only power. His words to the
woman of Samaria at the well apply:
"The hour comcth when ye shall

Wlml. Clnl'm Does He ndrcl

What is the clztiln that Jesus had
upon us—upan you? I ask this ques
than directly to you. I ask it not in
o narrow sense, not in the cunven-
tiohal religious sense; but 1 ask it in
the largest and most inclusive souse;——
What clcim has be upon you as men
and women and as citizens or the
United States and of the world?

Divestlng ourselves for the time or
all religious and creedal affiliations
and conventional platitudes and look—
ing ztt Jesus direct—how does he lm~
press us? lVotchlrig him as a subject
of the Roman empire, in the provincc
a: Judca, what appeal docs he in. .
upon us, living twenty centuries litter?
its o man living then what Claim can
he have upon us llvlng now?

 

He lived in the Roman ZOVETnment
in its most glorlous perlod. He did

not attack the governmental policy at
Rome llc , id nothing about it. But
he dill s. . mclbiug thot was in direct
l 'uc with the theory ol‘ government on
which Rome was built. That theory
won that Cocsar at Romc was the cells
ter and that the rest of the world rc-
vo cd around it. The demonstration
of it was military force. It was the
Ftolelnnic system at government, and
corresponded precisely with the views
held at the time, that the sun revolved
around the earth.

Jesus ropeotcdly soul in one way or
another that. men and human worth
constituted the center or mundane
things and that love which is clemen

not an army), was its validating powe .
Genuine government is not a projec-
tion from the outside. The principle
of Jesus undermined eileclively that

for all time as a working principle that
of voluntary obedience to constituted
authority.

Do not the democracies of today.
however crude they are, afﬁrm this
revolutionary principle? I venture to
say they do, Jesus claims your~rece
oguilion of this fact.

. sings Were Revolutionary.

This principle seems wholly inoucn-
sive and self-evident as we view it
today. We have become accustomed
to it ; to us it is a commonplace. We
do not recognize its dynamic quality.
But we must remember that no one
till Jesus came had said anything so
revolutionary. No one had declared
that righteousness, under the inspira-
tion of love, is the elemental law of
we, and the central principle of gov»
ernment.

This is not primarily a. religious
przuciple. II. penetrates every deport-
ment of life. or course we make it
ralgious, if we assimilate it and make
it the central motive 0! our everyday
activities. Jesus‘ did this. He illus~

ted this principle, lived it day by
day. He made it the rule or his life
in an alien atmosphere. The result
was a. growing irritation in those who
were comtortohlc and quite satisﬁed
with things as they were. His lite he
came a protest. The only thing to do
with such a character was to get rid
ot him, and they did, without for a
moment stopping the progress of his
plinciple as the guiding influence in a
great world movement. Jesus suf—
lered a common experience of pio~
neers. We are now a put or the
movement he started. It is our privi~
logo to work in it and to cooperate in
carrying it on. .

the reluctance of the human race to
see and accept the truth. He tells us
of some men bound in a cave. They
saw only the shadows cast on it wall
facing them. To these men in the
cave the shadows were the only reﬁll»
ties. If, perchauce, one of these cave
men should get out and see the sum
and the world, and the realities of it.
and then should come back, somewhat
blinded and conmsed by the bright
ness of the sun, and try to tell the
men In the cave what he had seen, he
would become a. laughing stodi. If he
should try to release them they would
callhim foolish and would try to do
violence to him and perhaps try to
klll hlm 2.5 a. danger to their come
munlty life. In fact that is just Whitt
they would do. It often happens that
way.

Men Don’t Want Truth

The cave type or men su‘ll exists. A
man occasionally becomes convicted of
truth. This truth becomes an obses-
sion. It masters his lite. He makes it
his business to prove it. It has wis-
dom in it, it has justice in it; it has
the promise of peace in it; it is
prophetic or cooperation in gl‘t’x’tl. plans
of fellowship and goodwill for man-
kind. All this. But men don’t want
it. They rerusc to have it. They
prefer the shadows. Opposition and
Conflict arise. The man must so; his
truth thrust out must Wait its time, Al—
ways so k righteousness and order
based on love, its a world promise foc-
ing a system based on military force,
bring the sword instead oi pence. That
is whitt Jesus said.

But that does not invalidate the
principle; it does not put on end to it,
incither to that particular principle
nor to any other formulated by Jesus.
Before Abraham Wits—those principles
wFre. They abide. And in spite of
all the opposition cl men and circum-
stance they are coming toward their
own place in World life.

.lesus' slayings Eternal

l venture to repeat with emphasis
‘tliis fact, that the principles of Je-
sus are independent of any affirma-
tion of counsel or of organization or
of creed They are independent also
of the individual Jesus himself. They
are true in the nature of things. He
‘raw that they were true. They are
|clernnl because true to life in its
farthest reach. But they grow into
realization day by day, as life with
keener vision claims them in its prac—
tieal affairs.

Scientific achievements gray! in the
same way. They grow just as fast as
men discover and claim the scientific
principles implicit in nature.

The result in both cases is scien-
ltific and in perfect accord with the
.laws of life. If Jesus is to abide and
,lo he the Savior of the world, his
principles must accord with the prin-
ciples on which the world is laund-
’ed. They do accord. Eternal his
’is not something we are going to have
after a time as a gilt handed out to
Us. It is something we have now, if
We live in harmony With life’s laws:
something we achieve continually by
‘obediehce to those laws. They belong
to the everlasting now. Strange it
is that men have not recognized their
scientiﬁc validity.

I told the class of 1923 at the ser—
,vico corresponding to this, that the
greatness oi Jesus was measured by
the reach of his ideals. so great
that they are an endless source of
challenge and inspiration, always in
some degree realizing themselves, but
never exhausting themselves. Their
vitality is timeless. I claimed for
this very reason that they were prac—
.tical.

“The truth shall make you Free”

Now I want to say to you that the
greatness ol Jesus is also demonstrat—
ed by the immediate adaptability 01
his ideals to the day's work. They
have the compulsion oi simplicity.
,Take this word, “The Truth shall
make you free." We have cherished
it as an ideal. We have worked it
in moltoes, have engraved it on the
seals of great institutions. It has
a lot of dynamite in it; but we have
usually avoided its consequences by
thinking of it as applying to a vague
and uncertain fnlurc, which ecclesias-
tically we call “eternal life." 1 want
to say to you with great emphasis
that it applies to the time now, and
will apply uneven—but especially
now. For‘Novll is our concern. Here-
in is the simplicity of Jesus. It
‘glorifies the time now. >
i What is the source or power in
Jesus? ls it something supernatural,
something that transcends our natural
I shall not touch this question. But
this l oitirm: nothing in Jesus which
is essential to right action in the com-
mon place activities of the day is boy-
and the reach of our mental and spir-
ituatl equipment. We grow together
with him in our capacity- for enlarg-
ing ser ice under the direction and
inspiration of his nature. This is hu-
man nature. This is not merely r
l'gion. It is the normal expression
oi natural lite. It includes religion,
“"6 must come to understand (and
this is a part at our obligation to
Jesus) that his life and our lite, to
the limit oi our spiritual capacity, ali-
vnnce in identical lines. We grow
with him; We live with him, if it is
our will to live With him.

l The significance of Jesus as an
‘abidillg force in the world is due to his

Cumplcte identification with the laws

of nature and of life. (which are the

lows oi God) and his understanding
