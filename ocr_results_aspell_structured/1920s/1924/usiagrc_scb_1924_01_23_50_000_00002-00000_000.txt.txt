The chief interest that the literary

to meet, is the interest in public dis,

cay of the literary societies has proven
that there are not enough men on the
campus who are sniiiciently interested
in this line ot work to keep four ol-
ganizations going, yet we believe there
are enough to create a single live
group.

There was a time when four nlen’
literary societies flourished on our
campus. Interest was spontaneous and
competition rampant. At that time hre'
lierary society furnished the chiefI
means by which men could associate
together, excepting the classroom and
the athletic field.

That was before the erection of tile
dormitories which have now stripped
the men’s societies or their monopoly
on the opportunity for fellowship, Tllat
was likewise before the multiplication I

of organizations with specialized in-l
tor-est, the English cluh, the llncy‘
club, Sigma Delta Chi, etc.

TheSc specialized groups, togcther;
with the dormitories, hare uupl'opl‘i~
hted much of thc energy and interest
that was once devoted principally to
the literary societies. As a result, we-
find all four of them in a more or loss

Arthur S. Coggeshall

to Lecture on

‘I‘Iliiiling Big itame
Ill The Rocks”

“HUNTING BIG GAME IN THE ROCKS” is the subs
inch of a lecture which will be given by ARTHUR STERRY
COGGESHALL, director of the Carnegie Museum, in Hor-
rick Chapel this Saturday night. This is the famous lecture
in which the speaker boasts that he can “turn the clock of
time back six million years." To clarify the subject mutter
of his theme Mr. Coggeshall will employ special still and
motion pictures which he has prepared from photographs
of dummies which in turn were fashioned from the actual
remains of prehistoric monsters found on the North Ameri-
can continent.

“Scientiﬁc magic” is one of the descriptions used by
one who has heard the lecture and was impressed by the
unusual manner in which the lecturer presented such a vast
amount of real scientiﬁc fact in a form which could be
appreciated by persons of no specially scientiﬁc turn of mind.
Mr. Coggeslldll has spent years of experimental Work all over
North America but especially in the Rocky Mountains where
he has unearthed many specimens of unusual interest which
have gone far to establish the prehistoric life on this coliti-
nan

By til personal research work Mr. Coggeshdll has come
to know chdutly how the huge prehistoric beasts of our own
country appeared, how they lived, even how they died. By
the pictures which he has prepared he will be able to vis-
ualize this strange, almost uncanny, life in a manner which
should be of unusual interest.
