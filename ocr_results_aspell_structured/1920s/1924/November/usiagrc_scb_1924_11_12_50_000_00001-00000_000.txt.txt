Urges Students to Drug (l'helnselves
Out of flu: “0010," Not Give Up
to Environment.

Since Monday morning at chapel, J.
Stitt Wilson, noted lecturer, world
traveler and social worker, has been
speaking to large audiences on the
campus several times each day. He
was so well received in his first leer
tures that be has been induced several
times to make addresses not on his
schedule. and his' reception by the and
iences seems to indicate that his
messages have been inspirational to
students and faculty alike.

In addition to his chapel lectures,
Mr. Wilson spoke in A. R. '11. both
Monday and Tuesday nights, and yes-
terday and today many regular elhss-
ea have been dismissed to give stu-
denta a chance to attend his open for-
um at 11:20. He was also asked to
talk to the men and women separately,
in the men's dining hall, and the
Quadrangle drawing room.

Begins with Failure

of Modem Education.

“The fnilur'e of modern education"
was the subject of Mr, Wilson's talk in
.obapel Monday morning. As a world
traveler, lecturer, and social worker,
Mr. Wilson offered a constructive crit-
icism of scrualled “modem education."

"one of the most dangerous things
about our personal and public life,"
declared Mr. Wilson," is the tendency
of people to use periods where there

' should he commas. We do not define
clearly enough nor far enough. In fact,
we have failed to define in our world
one of the most important things—ed-
ucation. And until we can define
man himself, we cannot educate him.

”If we ask for a definition of man,
we are told that man is bones, blood,
nerves and glands, and perhaps, it the
speaker thinks more deeply, -he adds
thought, observation, perception and
memory. But‘one of the saddest things
in the world today, is that such a mul-

‘ titude of people define life as but
physical and mental. True enough.
there are these two aforesaid dimen—
sions of man, but there is a far great-
er and far more important third dim-
ension. That third dimension is com-
posed of sympathy, affection, truth,
honor and love, and until we can
realize this culture of soul, we are
being cheated." >

Makes Catchy Appeal to
Inlutltitaui/s of “Doze.”

Speaking in chapel exercises Tues-
day morning, I. Stitt Wilson, noted
lecturer, presented a few preliminary
views on evolution, He declared that
man had not emanated from the monk—
ey,butthathe himselfhadheen the po-
tent factor in elevating himself. Draw—
ing an analogy between the firm strat-
um‘ of the upper earth and the hidden
mire, he depicted bow man was able
to raise himself from this ooze of ile
literacy to the solid basis of modern
culture, in conclusion he showed
that it was a predominating problem of
of the day that this consistency of the
upper modern world be upheld.

Art, the fourth tributary is exempli-
fied by the ancient Grecians. Their
third God was that of beauty, which
is representative of all art,

Revelation, the last tributary to
the river of truth, is best to be under-
stood by a study of a few transcendent
personalities of the path—Isaiah,
Buddn, Jesus. The heads and hearts
of these leaders were above those of
the masses, hidden in the clouds of
sublimity.

Tire inheritance of modern college'

Students, l\lr. Wilson believes, is the
access to these five rivers of truth.
Truth is the only thing that makes
life endurnblo An educated person
is worse of than an uneducated one if
he does not distinctly see the truth.
In conclusion, Mr. Wilson pleaded
with all college students to place be-
fore themselves the shrine of truth
and to worship it.

"Drama is the greatest educator and

will continue to be popular because
as Shakespeare said, the stage holds
a mirror up to the world. The tenr
dcnoy of the modern stage, is to place

i a premium on naturalness rather than

great acting. The new school does
not care for clearness of speech, and
yet it takes clcarness of speech to put,
a message across. If the actor‘
speaks naturally, he cannot make his
audience understand. Characters are
now chosen not bccause they are great
actors but bccnnsc they fit the part.
America does not fully appreciate
great art.
Foundation Being Laid

“Dramatic art has not developed
along with (he rest of our life. We
do not find any masters of emotions or

we have no great training schools as
in the past, and possibly because there
is no demand for the better. stuff.

Under “Doc" Evans, Plans Am Neal:-
ing Completion ror~ Biggest
Homecoming in Years.

Under‘the direction of the general
chairman Evan S. Evans, '02, and his
score of assistants, arrangements are
rapidly nearing completion for one of
the greatest Homecomings in the his—
tory of Crinncll.

Beginning with the pep meeting on
Friday night and ending With/the
dance on Saturday night, the pro~
gram inc udes one continual round of
entertainment for alumni and under
graduates. Coache‘s Hyland and Black.
and the Pioneer football squad have
been drilling intensively in order that
the gridiron battle, the one big event
of the Homecoming may not be a dis»
appointment to the returning alumni.

“PEP Fest? Friday Night ,

The celebration will officially com.
mence on Friday night with the “pen
feet" in the Men’s gymnasium. The
gmnasiuni will be used instead of the
A. R] B. because it will accommodate
more people and because it was an old
tradition that existed until the A. R.
H. was built a few years ago that all
Dép meetings should be held there.
Immediately following the pep meet—
ing the Dramatic club, directed by
Mrs. Hallie Flanagan will present the
play "You and I” at the Colonial
theatre.

Paul Macmaehron,i’ll, has charge of
the sport events on Saturday morning
which consist of a freshman football
game and a speedball contest. The
speedball game will be of particular
interest to the undergraduates as it
will be played between the Dibble hall
dorm champions and a picked team
from the rest of the men’s buildings.

Two organizations of long standing
at Crinneli will have luncheon] reun-
ions at noon Saturday, The Honor
G men, both graduate and undergradu-
ate, will meet. together at the men's
dining hall while the Chlp’s club will
hold a luncheon for the Old Blocks at
the Quadrangle at the same time.

WHO in Broadcast Game

One interesting feature of the Home-
coming this year is- that Crinnellians
who were unable to return to take
part in the reunion may at least hear
a play by play report of the Pioneer
clash with the Cyclones if they listen
in on station WHO, Bankers Life In-
surance Company of Des hioines. This
will be the first time that the report
of a football game on Ward field was
ever broadcast.

Open House at 0011er Club

At 4:30 in the afternoon the Faculty
club will hold open house and (allow—
ing the Varsity dinner at six o'clock
there will be an informal social gath—
erilig for the faculty and all visitors
iin the Quadrangle drawing room. At
the same time there will be a smoker
for men in the society halls. Junior
and senior students are urged not to
forget the varsity dinner in the Quad-
rangle, to which they are invited as
iwell as the football teams, alumni,
lpal‘ellts, facility and visitors.

The main nnruscmcnt on Saturday
evening will probably he the dance at
the Men’s gymnasium The Serenaders
will play and an admission of fifty
cents will be charged. There will be
decorations, a special quartet will
furnish music and rcircshrncnts may
be served.

The student committee composed of
John McGee, inclla Wareham Kath~
erine Davis and John sootts have made
plans for an elaborate decoration of
the dormitories and quadrangle and it
is expected that in the next few days
signs, banners and hunting will he

Seats have been selling rapidly and
if the weather is good the crowd Sat—
urday is expected to he one of the
largest that ever witnessed a football
game on Word field. The fact that
there is no other big game in Iowa,

The final dress rehearsals are now
under way for the Dramatic cluh [war
duction of “You and r'. Mrs. Hallie
Flanagan has been putting on the
finishing touches this week. Mary
Woodrum is conducting the orchestra
on Friday evening. The entire house
staff of the Colonial will be composed
of college students.

The Dramatic club wishes to an-
nounce, emphatically, that no one will
be seated during the first act. The
doors of the Colonial will not open un—
til eight o’clock, giving "coop-rnsbers"
a chance to attend the pep meeting.

“Fulﬁlled- and Son Play"

“You and I", by Philip Barry, is
considered one of the finest American
comedies of recent years.‘ The plot
is concerned with Maitland white, suc—
cessful manufacturer, who gave up
painting for business. Ricky, his
son, wants to do the same thing, and
upon this framework Mr. Barry has
built his play. “You and I" is most—
ly laughs but there are moments in
it when a tear is not out of place.

At this time the Dramatic club
wishes to thank those who have Con—
tributed to the production, The Child
Art Rooms have furnished numerous
properties. The press of the city of
Grinnell has given excellent coopera-
tlon.

Present indications are

ber of mail orders indicate thin, many

Editor at Trade Journal
Addresses Business mull

"College Men and Business” was the
subject which Mr, A. l. Eorcrnan, own-
er, cditor, and publisher of the “Mer—
(mum’s Trade Journal", and one or
Des Moines’ leading business men,
chose to speak upon before the Busir
ness club last Sunday afternoon. While
his talk was replete with many of his:
own experiences in handling men. it
principally concerned the replies
which he received from J. Ogden Ar-
mour, Ensel Ford, Simpson, of the
Sears Robuck Company, and other
when he wrote
then. asking about their experiences
with college men in business.

in summarizing these letters, Mr,
Boromamstatcd that the concensus of
opinion among these famous business
executives was that the qualities
which pointed toward success in blis-
iucss life, and which were so often
lacking in college men, were memory,
accuracy. health, pop, concentration,
knowlcdgc, ability to mix, will power
and a singlcness of purpose.

The“: will be no meeting of the
but on the follow»
mg Sunday, according to an announce
mont made by Donald Fullerton, pres-
ident or the Club Executive Council,

retary oi the Des Moincs Y. M. C. A,,
