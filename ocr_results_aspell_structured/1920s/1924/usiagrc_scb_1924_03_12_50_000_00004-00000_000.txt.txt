Lticine Finch to Interpret Madnllly
Stories and Unpublished
Songs of Old South.

A leoture course number or a de-
cidedly unusual nature will be pre.
sented in crinnell next Monday night
when Lucine Finch will upbeat on the
Herrick Chapel platiorm to give her‘
interpretation oi her iamous Mammy,
stories and unpuhlished“ Religious}
songs or the Old South.

Miss Finph's Negro mammY died in
New Orleans a few years 'sgo aiten
having given loyal service to three
generations of [he Finch family. but
Lucine moon is perpetuating the mem.‘
ory oi this iaithiui serwnnt by lire
serving the tales which were related
to her as o. girl. Miss Finch has also‘
made an extensive study or the old‘
Negro spiritual sons oi presivil war
days, and in other ﬁelds has pursued
her study oi the lore oi the Solltlllmdd.

Interprets Negro Lore. l

The work of Miss Finch, hmvevenl
has not only been one oi preservation,’
for she has unusual talent as an in-
terpreter ot the songs and tales which!
she has accumulated, and in this way;
is in a position to share her know.-
ledge or this interesting subject with
thousands of interested listeners. In
fact, it might he said with assurance}
that she hes done as much as any liv-
ing person to preserve the rich heri-
tage or the imaginative side of the old‘
Southern Negro.

Speaking of the ability of Miss Finch‘
in her interpretation or Negro lore
Arthur Brisbane, editor or the New
York Evening Journal, said, “Her art
consists of a novel interpretation or
the rich and varied character or the
old Southern "Mammy",7a type re-
called so readily and so lovingly by all
'who know the old South. When the
young woman plunged with charming
simplicity into the story or "Simon
Peter", its daring mixture of humor and
pathos stirred e jaded New York (milk
ence and tunazed them. Then came
the realization that here was a genre
ine portrayal of the antebellum
Negro, with all his inﬁnite variety and
