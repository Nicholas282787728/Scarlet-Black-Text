LLOYD‘S BASHFULNESS '
CAUSE or memos FUN

“Girl Shy” introduces mm In Scream-
lugly Funny hole.

The dictionary gives the deﬁnition

of bashfulness. as "shl‘lnklng mod—

,‘estym'But our deﬁnition, alter viewing

Harold Lloyd‘s latest Paths comedy,
“Girl Shy," at the Strand theater yes~
terday, is that hashinlness is decidedly
a subject for expansive laughter. Bash
fill persons have always inspired us
with pity for them, but when Lloyd is
seen as a boy scared to death or the
female sex, he makes the part one or
riotous mirth.

Lloyd is indeed one comedian whose
pictures are ever a delight to see. tor
the revievver and the audience never
know what to expect or him in ad-
vance. After a series of clever char.
acterizations and stories in the part.
he once more proves his great versa—
tlllty in "Girl Shy" by giving to the
screen‘oue or the most entirely novel
types or hero it has ever had. The
old adage that “there is nothing new
in the movies" has been completely
blasted at last. Lloyd deﬁnitely
proves the untruth o: the timeworn
statement ,

"Girl Shy” will remain at the Strand
theater tonight and Monday, and is
one or the tow pictures that can he
recommended heartily to those who
like to “shop" (or their entertainment.
For it is certainly a gloom-closer de
luxe.

Lorena Jones Gives
Interesting Recital

Lorena Jones appeared in a success-
ful piano recital last evening in Her-
Tick chapel. Her program included
compositions by Schumann, Chopin
and MacDowell.

The MacDoivcll concerto in D minor
was very well done, and especially
linteiesting since it is seldom heard.
The Chopin numbers were well receiv-
ed, and executed in a creditable man-

her.

Norris in conclusion. “The mile-
