the task of rebuilding his backfield

the loss of Captain Merle Makeover.
Head Coach Morny L. Elly has been
pushing his Kohnwks to the limit
since the Dubuque game two satur—
days ago. The peppery little 002 tax)-

game of the season, for this is his
fourth year on the team and Missouri

will be played. do not permit four-year
varsity activity.

The loss of M's’tkeever is keenly felt
by the Kohawk coaches. for he has:
been the mainspring of the eleven in
previous games this year. It was his
clever generalship that enabled the
Crimson to hold the mighty Wisconsin
team to a. tie three weeks ago and his
too has been invaluable in every game
he has participated in. l

To add to the misery ot Coaches Eby
and Jenkins. haliback Ray Smith, the
sophomore star, was called home last

largely on the clever running or Smith
