~ ' Theatre Saleem

(By E. H. Billion)

The s. T. 0. sign was out at the A.
R. He auditorium last 'nightond the
Experimental Theatre inaugurated. a
season that promises to be most in-
; tersstlng. The productions that made
up the first bill proved admirablefrom
almost every viewpoint, being rich in

contrast and dramatic contan
Lewis Beach's “Thejclod” is a splen-
did bit of-wrlting. 'It has fine char-
acterization of the central figure to
recommend it, excellent motivation
and presenmtion of human conflict.
It is a play of power and it requires
- power in the players themselves, The
. setting of “The Clad" provided s. prop-
er background for the action. 'To us
it was the bestintcrior we have ever
“seen on the A. R. ii. . singer'
llghting’was equally good, .
i “The 010d" Seemed Via!
The actors had their ditficulties but
they succeeded in making the play
very vital and moving. 'Miss Rogers
created a Mary that was a portrait of
cbiectmisery. Sodiien, the mere shad-
ow of a. human being, Mary Trask liv-
2 ed her way through the greater part
of,the play. Mr. Guild, by intelligent
acting, sustained his characterization
and at times, with only a phrase. sug-
gested tremendous power. The act—
-ing 0! most of the cast consisted of
"moments." Thopiayers were and then
they were not, The precipitate action
in the last‘part of the play almost dc-
' stroyed its realism ‘Trankiv we were
, stunned, but not in the- right sway
Mary Trask was not a sharp shooter.

at least Lewis Bede-b never Conceived-

her in that way. The family musket
'did not, in all probability, have a Max-
im silencer, and if it had it is unlike-
ly that two stalwart soldiers would
perish so completely from the eftect of
bullets projected through the ceiling.
But this is demanding too much of our
directors in an era of peace! The
audience enjoyed “The Clad" and in
the parlance of the vaudeville halls
“they ate it up!”
A Refreshing Romance
"The Romancers‘wvas delightfully
=tre_sh and amusing. Who could desire
-a lovlier garden than that which Miss
Grant designed? And what garden
‘ would not bloom with pleasure to pos-
been a Sylvette so piquant and utterly
captivating as that created by Miss
Carma? if we were to retrace our
experience in‘ the theatre to the days
to! Maude Adams it is with difficulty
"that we could remember any laughter
as delightfully natural and eloquent as
Vﬂlnt of Sylvette. Mr. Andrews and
Mr. Jones found places in our favor;
‘the lormer for his agility in hurdling
and the latter for a spirited imperson—
:atlcvn of the irate father. The moons
light was well reproduced in “The no-
manners", its exact genesis is it mat-
'tel' for the astronomers to figure out
There were many other things that
made the evening enjoyable. The new
progtun covers were pleasant as was
the rapidity with which the scenes
were shined. The acting of each in-
dividual was marked by intelligence
.-.nd it was evident that all enjoyed the
thing they were doing. The plays Lb
forced splendid opportunities and
those were realized, We are glad to
recognize the progress that the Ex—
perimental Theatre has made and to
congratulate its sponsors upon an eye-
ning of excellent "theatre."

anious Editor l‘ells Press Delegates
:to StudyJVoldd Relations and
Mac Problems.

“The problems of race and world re—
lations are more important to' the
would—be journalist than how to get
into newspaper work," declared liar-
’vey lngham, -edltor of the Des Moines
Register, at the first session of the
Iowa High School Press Convention
held in the Quadrangle Theatre Friday
afternoon. /

"learningnewspaper work is large-
ly a matter of adjustment You will
have to think things out first."

“Newspaper men, like most people,
have usually let the nearness of the
news source determine its relative lln<
pertcnce. This practice must be drop-
ped, for world relations will be of
paramount importance to the future
Journalism. ,

"The question of world relations ‘ld
forcing itself upon us more strongly
everyday. War industrial competition
and the‘ payment of reparations are
only a few of the many great world
problems which demand our dtten~
tion."

bam asserted, “that war is no longer
a process of going out to conquer a
people? Conqueror, likc conquered.

"Europe, only beginning
‘ ~ it took the
United States, new and unexhausted
country that she wits, thirteen years
to reach bottom after the Civil War.
Europe must take much longer to
right herself after being exhausted of
manpower and resources. it may
even require another war to bring
about a lasting settlement.

World peace is also necessary to
our own prosperity. We must either
extend the orderly processes of emer-
ica to the world or descend to disord-
er ourselves. These are the alterna-
tives which face us.

Race problems are also demanding a
solution. Competition between white,
yellow, and black is daily becoming
keener in business, art and science.

The notion or race superiority is
largely a social prejudice. These pro-
prejuuices have so twisted and dis-
ordered our ideas that we no longer
see race problems in a fair light.

"The responsrbliily of young people
is greater today than it has ever been
before," concluded Mr. ingham.

“America is great today that she
may spread the source of that great—
ness. if she fails, it is because the
rising generation has missed its mls»
mission and failed in its trust."

Convention Delegates
Are Interviewed
by Reporter.

hir. ilatlack, the Grinueli Alumni
Secretary, is credited with remarking
that the convention was a “bowling
success." Just to make sure that he
was right, the Scarlet and Black sent
a reporter to interview a few of the
delegates.

D. E. Sprague, faculty representative
from West High. Des Moines: “I have
attended all ﬁve of the annual conven-
tions of the association and I can say
that the ﬁfth one was the best. I liked
the fact that more emphasis was
placed upon general subject matter ra-
ther than upon technique."

James K. switzer, business manager
of the Waterloo ”Spectator": “Water-
loo fellows got lots of beneﬁt from the
convention. it was practical, yet there
was a touch of humor, We were made
to feel right at home all the time."

George Shuey, editor of the Mar-
shalltown "Pebbles": These convene
tions are a ﬁne thing to have. I'll
surely come again next year if I can."

victor Harvey. business managel ur
the ,Oskaloosa "0": “I liked the ems
phasis which was given to the putting
out of annuals. So many schools do
not publish papers but are particu-
larly interested in annuals."

Vernon Whaley, editor of the "5th
light," Valley Junction: "I was especi»
ally pleased Mr. Alle's talk this

On the whole the conven-
tion has been very successful."

irrank Spurier, editor of the "Avr-
Plune" of Mount Ayr: "Though I ens
joyeu all the programs immensely. the
hospitality of Grln'nell impressed me
even more.”

Practice Starts For
Girls’ Class Teams

Canard, Bust, Rowe, and Lynde, to

Lend Teams in Class Series.

Captains of ztll the class basketball
teams have been chosen by the mem—
bers. Elizabeth Couard will have
charge of senior basketball, Harriet
Rust of junior. Bernice Rowe, sopho-
more, and Esther Lynde, freshman.

llluch enthusiasm has been shown
this year in basketball and competition
for places on the lirst teams is keen.
There is unusually good material in
the freshman class and upperclassmeu
will have to look to their laurels. Add~
ed interest in the sport has been
caused by the new basis for basketball
this year. Under this ruling, physical
training credit is given and practice is
in organized classes. A point is giv-
en to all girls participating in at least
one full game or two halves. strict
training rules are being kept by the
girls. These include eight consecu-
tive hours of sleep every night, 116
pastry or candy, and no eating he'-
tween meais except fruit.

QuadrangularDebaies
Allah's/led By Union

Lack of Interest in the Inﬁll-Sm!
Debates muses Amdonlnent.

Plans [or the annual quadrangular
inter-society series of debates have
been abandoned, the Debating union
announced. The members of this un—
ion declare that since so little inter-
est is displayed in the debates each
Year, and since it is so difﬁcult (or
some of the societies to get together
even a singlet team, in the interests of
good debating the series should be
eliminated from the campus. Such
a ruling is a decided departure from
debating traditions at Gl'lnnell, fur the
inter—society debates have been a part
of the schedule for many years.

The Merrill debate will be continued
of course, and no action has been
taken to do away with the freshmen
inter-society debates which are sched-
uled tor next spring.

The Debating union has expressed
the hope that the new ruling Will not
cllminztte inicrrsoclety debating rela~
tions entirely, merely the formal
quadrangular series which apply on
the Worth trophy. The union urges
societies to challenge each other ln~
formally to debate questions of local
interest, Ionian society has already
challenged Forum to a debate on Sun<
day dates, to be hold some time in Jan-
nary.
