Editor Scarlet and Black
Grinnell College
Sir.

I recently received the enclosed copy
of it letter Written by Sir John Gals-
worthy io the organization trying to
relieve the suffering of the students
and professors on ceneral Europe. At
il. time when “the peril to learning is
extreme" l hope that the Grinncli
community will do its share. For
that purpose. I hope that you may
find it possible to print Galswoitliys
letter in your columns.

Respectfully yours,
M, .i. BRADSHAW.
A letter from Mr. Gs‘lsworthv,
London, England, dated Qatar
her 6th, 1923. T

i am ashcd to say shortly why I,
support the Universities Relief Fund,‘
and why I believe that it needs the'
help of all British Scholars and Stu-
dents.

I thinlr there is folowshlp in Learn-
ing, a bond between all of us who try
to furnish the house of the mind. and
add a little stature to the spirit. 1
think that Learning is so far beyond
barrier of race or country that on its
coherent march Western clvllizntion
depends; that if Learning rots and
withers from sheer lack of food and
money in great regions of Europe
such as Germany, our own learning
must suffer, our trade must suffer,
our ve civilization bs imperllled by
chaos to which it leads

When We see a great multitude of
our fellow scholars and students
strugg ling his, all euiilence [shows
against every kind of miserable lusuf-
nciency, without food enough, or ade-
quate heat and shelier, without money
to buy books and the means of know-
ledge or research, with health under-
mined by want, and strength spent,
and often in the grip of disease—When
we see them struggling heroically to
keep the foothold against a tide roll—
ing inexorably out, 'when i leel'that to
stand aside and not put out a helping
hand is like letting men drown be~

_foro one’s eyes.
I Lilat' Though perhaps no writei of
English blood at ',least has had more.
digs at the British than myself 1

. think There is great meaning in the

expression ”to be British." and I feel
that here is a chance for the real

,humanity, the generosity to a toe, the

rising above pettinsss—in a word, ior
that msgnanirnity with which I, at
least, identify the phrase, and which
‘makes the British, with all their faults
and laiungs, the trustees of hope in; a.
world Where hope lies stricken.

The evidence of suffering and need
among scholars and students in Ger-‘
many and other parts of Central and
Eastein Europe (but especially now
in Germany) overwhelms sll disbelief,
the peril of Learning is extreme, The
chance shines out {on a display of the
British spirit, and for a gesture which ‘
may mean much to the future. A

For these reasons I support the Uni—
vanities Rolls! Fund, and trust illlll
it will have the help of all British
scholars and students.
