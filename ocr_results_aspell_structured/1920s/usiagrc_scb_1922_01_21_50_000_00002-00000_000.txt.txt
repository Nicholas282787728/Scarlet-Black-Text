MAKING IT ATTRACTIVE

Tlle chicf frrnction of a univcrsity—
that for which it existsiis scholiil
ship. This fact every student admits.
and very few put it into practice. a
university without class rooms is in-
conceivable, and yet to many the chrss
room is nothing more than a neces—

There are two ways of combating
this attitude on the part of the studs

but it is not easy to mako him under»

the average.

The evil is rootod in the general
attitude toward studies. For sonic:
reason that is hard to analyze it is
not popular to make thcm ones hour

down upon, though as a matter of fact
hc is usually not nearly so unattrac-
tivo as his nickname.

This second group of leaders in the
class room, however, are the sublects
of injustice on the part of the rest or
the student body, _In their rather rest—
less search for something to do in the
early part of their college days, they
have gone into outside activities. If
successful they'bave usually had a
rather meteoric career to the highest
positions on the campus, which of
course brings the criticial title of
"popularity seekers.” The criticism
does not amount to much. because
tbesc “popularity seekers" seem to be
the most popular when there is a job
with any duties connected with it. Job
after job is heaped upon the busiest
people in spite of their earnest pro—
tests. The result is that they are load—
ed down with so many responsible
positions that they cannot even fulﬁll
the obligations of the outside activi»
ties efficiently, let alone making an
honest attempt to get their regular
class work. ~

When we are criticising the holders
of thc important posiuons of respon—
sibility on the campus, it is well to
remember why theyl have these posi—
tions; with some it is cxccptionai abil—
