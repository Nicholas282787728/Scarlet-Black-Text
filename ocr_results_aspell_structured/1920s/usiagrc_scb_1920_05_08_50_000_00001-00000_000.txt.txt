meeting
Mathews

Says

"One or the fundamental elements
of liic is fellowship," said Presi-
dent iilain at the Y. M. C. A. meeting
Thursday evening. "The . mbol of
the whole world before Christ came
was power and authority over man,
and not iellowship and companion
ship’ with men. Everything started
new; there was an end to the domin—
ion ot power, and now, in 1920 we are
just beginning to catch glimpses oi
His sympathy and love,"

“I do not know what institution
there is in the world, aside from the
church, which more ntly illustrates
the spirit of fellowship as shown by
Christ than the collegt7nny college7
this college especially because this is
the college for us. You have never
heard me talk much about religion.
because lite rightly adjusted to its
relationships is religion. Christ did
not come into the world to lound a
new religion, brrt he said over and
over that he came to give lite and to
give it more abundantly,

"If we want to be great in this
world we have got to adhere to the
principles ot living which are in ac-
cordance with God, and that means
simply living the life that is worth
while. Your great opportunity, men.
especially the great opportunity of the
upper-elassmen, is- to give an atmo
phere oi genuine living, and to make
living in these halls the principles
upon which this institution is found-
ed."

Lost Fountain
of Youth.

Do you long for the Fountain o'
Eternal Youth? Have you, like Ponce
de Leon, been unsuccessful in your
search for the secret of perpetual
happiness? it you have, then listen
carefully tor a new method has both
evolved:

in the olden days, chance and m
chance reigned supreme. The master
astrologer made orie's horoscope and
took frequent observations irom his
imagination. Now, uncertainty is han-
ishcd and science and scientiﬁc ioi»
mulae are paramount. All things are
reduced to certainties and pass into
historic events.

Ponce de Leon tailed to ﬁnd his
ionntain ol‘ yorrth and decided the
the secret lay within one's heart,

Science has louud that it is not ll
ohe's heart, but in the association or
many hearts, in royal good iellow
ship. Come, then, all ye that at"
weary and heavy laden, come to tr
All College Ficnic, May 15, and ﬁnd
good cheer and iollity in association
with your fellow students, faculty
members, and alumni.

or tor riot ﬁnLlllig them? 11 you are
