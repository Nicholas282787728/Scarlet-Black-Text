PA NE SPEAKS OF

“The uoild too, is enpci-ieucing

those making loi- evil. but will pres
\‘ail only it the ideal join in a cone
stout ell’oit to make them prevail. He
keeps his feet on the ground, but his
head in the air.”

“who: can we do to promote the
cause or sensible idealism, to save so-

and long haired cranks and visionar—

"\V‘e must hold to our youthful
idealism against the tendency to sur ‘

terms,” declared the speaker. “The
average man makes a living, keeps out
of jail, and if he has any enthusiasm
left becomes a booster tor things
they areiin a world, he becomes ‘re-
spectable,’ I want to warn you against
becoming ’respectahlc,’ or at least'
M'ERELY respectable. Some, like
Ulysses, escape the fate of conform-

idealist; and it. is this that I hope for
you: that, you may drink of lite to the

meet; drink delight of battle with'
your peers, (though I hope the battles
Will be different. from those Which
Ulysses fought); that you will follow‘
knowledge like a. Sinking star. beyond1
the utmost hound at human thought:
and finally. that you Will prove strong i
in will to strive, to seek, to find, and
not to yield."
