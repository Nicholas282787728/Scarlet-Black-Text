of their life together ﬂourished in
print for the benelit oi the general
public. His rebellion testers and
bursts; he leaves home to taire an
apartment in the city; there is dnolhe
or girl and the other girl's tinancee.
The latter is conspicuously absent
when the young wiie walks in upon
her husband and the other girl. .

However, it is this same other girl
who finally tahes hold of the situa-

into a happy and Satisfying ending.
The theme is one that confronts every
Writer; the story is written in an en-
tertaining manner. and has hints in
places of something more worth—while
than the ordinary magazine story.
