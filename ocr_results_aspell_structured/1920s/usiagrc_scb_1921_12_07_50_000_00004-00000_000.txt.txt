lEﬂlUllE BUUHSE TALK

Discusses Relations of America.
and J upon as World Problem—
Basis of Peace.

"Japan is more important to us to.
day. than any other nation," declared
Doctor Edward T. Devine, professor of
social economy in Columbia, in hls
lecture in Herrick chapel last Sauna
day evening. "The tuture peace or
the entire world depends upon the
mutual agreement of Japan and the
united states."

The Monroe Doctrine, the "open
door" policy in China, and the Japan-
ese problem were the points principala
ly emphasized by Dr. Devine in the
lecture. At once a. real scholar or
economic problems and world affairs
and a commanding speaker he was.
able to hold the attention of the large
audience throughout the evening.
Many expressed keen disappointment,
however, at his absolute failure to
touch upon any phase of the Disarm-
ament conlerence.

Tire Japencso Question

In his discussion or the Japenese
question, Dr. Devine gave as the
three great prohlems of Japan the
surplus population, the lack oi raw.
materials, and the lack or markets tor
extensive commerce. They are not
new problems," said the speaker.
Germany and England had to meet
them. But Japan has a real grievance
against the United States. Our immi—l
gration, naturalization, school, land-
tax laws are all unlair to the Japan
ese. But though we have not treated
them justly in these respects they
have no right to ask for unlimited. iin-
migration and racial equality for we
are now their peers because or our
iriendliness with our neighbors and
our higher standard of living."

In conclusion Dr, Devine said: "We
shall say to JapauiDo not dream of
Empire; stop bullying and bribing;
be satisﬁed with the advantages that
are yours; he mindtul ot the great
ends proserihed by your own scholars;
be a great nation among great na—
tions; and be friendly,"

Dr. Devine is a graduate of Cornell
Pennsylvania university. Previous to
his professorship in Columbia he was
for two years lecturer at Oxford, in
England. He is now editor of “Sure

 

vey."
