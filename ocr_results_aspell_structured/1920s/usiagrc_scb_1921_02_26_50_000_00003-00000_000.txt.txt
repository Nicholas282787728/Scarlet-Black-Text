‘uf the zoology department of the Uni-
versity of Kansas. The proof is siur
iplercignrettes are harmful to glowri

after exhaustive tests of the effects

some four and a half months, or dine

according to W. J. Baumgartner, pro-
fcssor of zoology, in a paper rend
before the fifty-third annual conven-
tion of the Kansas Academy of Scir
cnce, Friday.

"There has never been opportunity-
of course, to carry out a like expo ‘
ment with human beings,” said Pro»
lessor Baumgarlner, "but I should
judge that were such an experiment
possible, the results would be similar.
it has long been stated as a fact that;
cigaret smoke retards the growth of
young boys, but never was there ac-
tual scientific experiments to prove
'the assertion, so far as I know. it is
my ohiect to furnish such data.

“I find that the effect of cigaret
smoke on young rabbits is very mark-
ed. It retards their growth, causes
them to be less active, and seedling
ly affects their morale in that they:
do not keep clean as other rabbits.
Those who inbalcd smoke a half hour
three times a day sulked, played with
each other less and did not attain
normal size.

“I am continuing to watch these
same rabbits to determine what ef-
fects, if any, are noticeable in the
offspring of the "Smoked” rabbits that
are not evident in those of the normal
rabbits.

Dr. James Naismitb has found that

they are addicts to the habit iu some

most dangerous age, as thirty fell

«though twenty eight fell by the road
side when they were seventeen, ac-

began smoking after they had attained
their majority and five must have
been smoking since infancy, as they
were unable to remember just when
they did start using tobacco.
