say that all or them are a credit to the
journalistic profession: When our

in the morning in a family with a
journalistic father and five journal-

said, conspired to make him editor-in

WHAT DOESN‘T

ENETRA‘TE my thick skull

is whg the dickens this
popcorn doesn’t liv up to its
promise, why doesn't it pop?
We all wanted some so much
too, you kind of feel like pop—
corn just before Thanksgiv-
ing and it tastes so good in

w it. I've got an idea Just
a jiff and I’ll race down to
SDATER‘S and get some, has
somebody got seven cents for-
a pound of it?

OH MY DEAR!

ERE we were all set to

have this perfectly spon-
dllliolls dinner party and the
faculty guests were arriving
and all of a sudden my bright
roommate came rushing out
of the dining room and said
there wcrcn’t any candles on
the table I nearly died of
apotlieosis, my dear, hilt she
flew down to MULLINS and
got the cutest candles I've
ever seen. Tlley jllst filled
the occasion: MULLINS' have
a habit of doing that any-
way.

TWO QUADVITES

ASSlNG ALMY'S began a

heated discussion. “The
pink ones are loads cuter be-
sides, they match my room."
“You‘re on the wrong street
car, my dear. the hie ones
aren't even dcignin to think
about the pink ones, besides
blue matches my new Pa-
jimmy set.” "You just don't
know your subject, sweet-
heart, the pink ones are
best.” “Too dumb, too diiinb,.
You’re color'hlind.”

Enter third Quadrite. “What
ARE you talking about?”

“The feathered d o r n e d
mules, nonesueh, the feather»
adorned mules."

THERES ONE THING

THAT we often forget and

that really would be
the thing to do, and that is
to get something to take
home to oilr mothers for
Thanksgiving. Jim, down at
CANDYLAND, says he has a
grand stock of candy for ‘ust
this purpose and I think it
would be a good idea to run
(lO\\'I\ and get 2‘ box just be»
fore the train pulls out for
home.

HURRY UP

"CAUSE tonight you’ll re

member that you should
have bought a flower for
your formal and forgot all
about it, It you rush down
to MANATT'S you'll have
time to llll‘ one and be back

and get there before some
body else realizes that she
