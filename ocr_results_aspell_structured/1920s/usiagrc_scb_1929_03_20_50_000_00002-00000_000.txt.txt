A FAIR RULIXG.

According to the faculty ruling on senior croruinn-
tions, the matter of exemption is put into the hands of
the professor in charge of the course, If he thinks that
the senior has kept up his work throughout the term,
he may let that student out of the final examination. on

THE GRINN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

dency to slnclrcn his pace during the closing weeks of
the year, the professor is at liberty to require that stu-
dcnt to hike his ﬁnal examination The rule is elastic
enough to insure co-opcrntion hotween the fncuity nnd
tlic seniors. The theory being, of course, that it the
students show the proper willingness to keep up their
dniiy work, the fnculty will reciprocate by letting them
out of the finnl examinations ut a period when the stu-
dent is cngngcd in packing, coring for friends nnd relilr
lives, and bidding goodbye to Grionell.

There is every clemont of fairness in thc ruling,
providing the rule is understood by seniors and facility
monihcrs alilt . if the ruling lids suited that senior eXr
animations were ninndutor we think it could he shown
that the promise that ex ninniions arc the only criteria
for grading n. scuior strident could he shown to be fair
lnciou It has been nsscrtcd hy some that exumihav
lions nrc necesary for tugging the outgoing senior us n
niemher of Class A. E, C, or D. 'Wc do not agree with
this stutcmcnt. Gl'innell prides hcrsulf on the fact that
the ratio beLWeeu faculty and students is so small that
the student comes in contnct with his professor and rm
intimate relationship is possible. if this be true, is it
possihlc ioi- a student to go four hrs to Grilmell and
then be suhicctcd to an examination by his major and
minor professors his lost wool: in school? We contend
that thc facility can determine uhether or not a. strident
should graduate by other ways thou n final examination.

Wc heliovc the majority of thc fhciilty share our
View on this question of senior exuminutions. No iault
citn he found with the cri cisni that seniors might slacks
en their pace if they were surc they would got out of
examinations. However, the present ruling tulrcs ca‘re
or this difficulty. The student knows that eieiupticn
from his final is dependent upon keeping up his daily
work and showing proper interest throughout the year.
Being human, he will do everything in his power to he
exempt from the nffliction of these examinations, Nor
do no douht. that the factuly will respond ivith counl
promptness in rewarding that attitude hy granting a
senior his prerogative.

\Ve would hasten the day when examinations can be
relegated to the past, when education will he incentive
enough [or the student to work and the professor to
teach without the nrtiiicirtl and purely superﬁcial meth-‘
od of examinations to spur him on to better things. This
giv s a wide opening for Grinneil to exercise hel' tra-
dition, to pioneer in this field. Students and facility
will go forward together, n better understanding nlnking

the other hand, if the student has shown a distinct ten-

for a bigger and better Grinnell.

Dear Whatser:

Believing that you have on angelic
regard for compassion and forgive

lines upon your modesty. I trust that
your trained intellectual chm-actor
will withstand all of the involuntary
attacks that my crlldences and his
ieriority might bring upon you. How»
ever distasteful and vulgar this let-
ter may portray its writer, if truth
and honesty will shine through the
defects, they will portray nothing
hut good intentions, good will and
good wishes on the part or the writ-
er, as he blunders about in his efr
forts to compliment you,

My Buddy challenged me to write
a letter to my invorite of the ten ass
