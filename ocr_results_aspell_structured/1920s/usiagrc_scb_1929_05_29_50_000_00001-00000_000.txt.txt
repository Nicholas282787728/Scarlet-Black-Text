occasion in the javelin to throw it

pole vault to tie for second place.

peoted but were not forthcoming.

Des Moines, and Omaha arose in in-
dignation when the news reached
them tutti. the faculty representatives

secret session at Evanstan, Illinois,
llad expclled their alma mater from
the conference, Professionalism in
athletics was the charge at the meet-
ing Saturday night.

Pay Solories Denied

Athletes at the Iowa institution
vigorously denied the accusations.
“Never got a cent," and “Don't know
a thing about it" were characteristic
expressions in the answers of such
illustrious S. U. I. stars as Pape,
Farrell, and McLain, when asked it
they knew anything about salar-
ied athletes on the University cam-
pus. They freely insinuated however
that such things go on at other Big
Ten institutions. Parroh even stated
that he had received offers from oth-
er Western conference universities,

almost as easy as it sounds with the
number two match being the only
disaster for the locals ‘when Max Ev-
erett handed Ernie Stowe a 64, 6A1
lacing. Coggeshall was playing
great tennis when occasion demand-
ed and he ran Brody all over the
court before taking the top end of
the 6-3, 6-8, 6-3 count.

With Brody tired from his strcnu-
ous efforts of the singles, the num-

her one doubles match was not the
sparkling battle that was anticipated,

Grinnell winning. 6~2, 6-4.

Pratt §nTgs at Last
Chapel for Seniors

Miss“ Leah Pratt, instructor in
voice, gave a recital at the last sen-
ior chapel program which was held
in Herrick chapel this morning at
ten o'clock, Miss Pratt was accom-
panied at the piano by Edward Shad-
bolt. .

The program consisted of three
numbers. The first of these, Voca
dl donna," is from the Italian opera,
“Glocandtl” by Ponchielli. The sec-
ond number cntitlcd "Near the Walls
of Seville," Seguildilla Scene from
Carmen was written by the French
composer, Elzet, The last number of
the program was the well known
selection, "My Heart at Thy Sweet
Voice" irom "Samson Delilah” by
Saint-Scene.

Only two other senior chapel pro-
grams have been held this year, al-
though in previous years more have
been held. At the first of these Dr.

but llud ignored them entirely, cling-
ing with s. U. I.

Alumni were less positivc in their
statements, but expressed a doubt
that any of the other members of
thc conference were in a position to
cast the first stone. It was admit-
ted that Iowa student- including ath-
lctes, nre aided in finding jobs, but
they doubled whether anyone receiv-
ed any cold cash for athletic service
rendered.

Rotten ligg lloltillg name,

But the alumni are just the body
that is being accused. it is generally
admitted that the athletic department
would no write monhly checks to
gridiron heroes, although President
Jessup avoided the issue with the
statement that the athletic depart-
ment's hooks have not ‘been audited
for several years. Most of the help. it
was asserted, comes in roundabout
ways. Alumni in the athletes home
town find means of assisting a poor
boy to get an education, or enable him
to find a remunerative position during
the summer.

lowa university is not hopelessly
lost to the conference, it was revealed
after the conference with conference
commissioner Major Griffith yester-
day morning. Even if Iowa does not
show signs of cleaning up, she will re.
main in the conference until January
1, 193:}; thus next fall’s football con-
tracts remain valid, and lowa has sev-
en months to think it over.

“Plenty of Others”

Iowa will not leave the conference
without a struggle. There is a strong
feeling among the university faculty
that the athletic department needs a
cleanup anyway; and the athletic de-
portment is sllre that it is no worse
than other athletic departments. "Sit
