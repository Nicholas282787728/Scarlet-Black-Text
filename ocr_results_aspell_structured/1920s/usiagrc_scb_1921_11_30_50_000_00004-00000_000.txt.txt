BULLDOGS TAKE ‘ANNUAL
BATTLE FROM PIONEERS

(Continued from rage One)
Grinnell's favorr From then on the
hall was a see—saw in which neither
team was able to score but in which
Grinnell clearly had the upper hand

Third Quarter.

Drake came back in the second half
with a strong attack. Two smashes
netted ﬁrst down. Then Boelter was
substituted for James with the ball on
Grinneli’s 32-yard line. On the next
play Boelter received a pass from
Niggemeyer and after eluding several
Pioneer tackles he crossed the goal
line for Drake's ﬁrst score. Nigge-
meyer kiuked, making the score 10 to
7. Grinnell came back strong after

this score and began a. strong offen-'

sive attack. A pass to Norelius on a
special shift netted 18 yards but on
the next play Boelter intercepted a
pass. A pass, Niggemeyer to Boeltei',
put the hall on the Grinhell 28<yorﬂ
line and a duplicate of the play re-
sulted in a second touchdown for
Drake. Niggeineyer's kick was good.

Truckenmiller ran the kickoff back
as yards but a Grinnell pass was inter—
cepted and the hall went to Drake on
the Grinnell 45—yard line. On the sec—
ond play Boelter ran around the right
end and hooked another pass which
he ran for 42 yards for a touchdown,
Niggemeyer kicked goal, Score: Drake
21, Grinnell 10. From then on the
Drake team was unahle to seriously

threaten the Pioneer goal again butt

the mischief had been done and in

spite of their frenzied efforts to re-‘

trlsve their defeat Grinuell was unahe
to push the hall over the Drake line
again. 7

Captain Markley and Norelius were
the outstanding Pioneer stars,
ley's line smashing was one of the
features or the game, He repeatedly
ripped through the Drake line for long
gains and starred especially on oifen-
sive work. At center Norellus played
p'rohahly his best game of the season.

Lino stars.

The best work of the Fioneer team
was done by the linesmen who never
had any considerable gain made
through then Datesman, although
injured on the second play of the hrst
quarter, stuck to his post and ﬁnished
gaunely. Richards and Miller, playing
their last game in a Grinnell uniform,
played a. lighting game and aply held
the left wing at the Pioneer line.
Schmidt, Nichols and Janssen also
played steadily, allowing few plays to
slip through them on the defensive
,and opening good holes for the backs
.on the offensive.

star of the game but his runs seemed
lmore the result at luck than of especi—

it was a wonderful game and Grin-
nell has no apologies to make. They
showed a spirit or sportsmanship and
ygl‘it which not only made Grinnellians
proud of them out also gained the re—
spect or their opponents.
