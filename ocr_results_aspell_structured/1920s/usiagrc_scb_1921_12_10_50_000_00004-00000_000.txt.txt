l TEcllow, Chin 7(Speciai tu Scar—
let and Black.)# ‘he present school
.ycnr gives promise or being one oi the
most encouraging in the history of the
Grlnnellrinrchina movement. With
‘the unusual conditions imposed by the
famine situation cf lzlst year now re.
i moved the work of a nurnial year may
for almost the ﬁrst time be ca led out.

Last ycar the enrollment in Porter
Middle Schoolithe boy's academyil
was reduced by laminc conditions to an ‘
attendance of la while the cificiency
or the faculty was greatly hampered
by the absence ol the schcol princapal
Paul Mac Eachrnn, '11, who had charge
or the Red Cross relief work [or thisi
district. As addihoual famine meas-
urcs the academy conducted a night
schucl with an attendance or about
100 and maintained a "poor school”
lor rainine orphans. Naturally all of
these things detracted from the ether
iency of the regular walk or the
school.

With the return to normal condi-
tions this fall the enrollment in the
boys academy has picked up to 77 and
the course or study has been restricted
to the regular middle school work
with only two years of preparatory.
The coming of Mr. Decker releases
Mrs, MacEachron trom her Work in
History and by releaving Mr. Mac
Eachron from the majority of his Eng.
lish classes leaves him morq time to
devote on the executive work of the
cutiaying primary schools. Instruction
is largely given in Chinese tho the

more :idmnced classes are held in
English. From the standpoint oi the
faculty the school has a
teaching force this year than it has
hitherto had. The iaculty consists of
six iull time Chinese instructors, two
part part time foreign teachers and
two full time icreigucrs. The person.
as is as follows: Mr. Chang and Mr.
Cliao, the Chinese classics; Mr. Chou,
Mathematics; Mr. Esu, English; Mr.
H. T. W'ang, Sciences; Mr. Y. H. Wang.
Dean of Men; Mr. Heininger, Billie;
Mrs. Heininger, Music; Juhn Decker,
‘21, English and History; and Paul
lliacEachron, 111, principal.

The situation in Wycofi' Academy-—
the girls school—is likewise vastly irn.
proved over that'of last year. The
primary schools for famine orphans
have been abandoned and inst years
attendcncc has grown from 59 to 81
girls. The work of the school now
covers the whole scale of grades from
Kindergarten thru the second year of
the Middle school. Special attention is
given to practical instruction, on sew-
ing. needle Work and the like. The
girl‘s school facility is strengthened
this year by the return from fuiu
laugh of Miss Mable Huggins, a grad-
uate of Washhurn. Miss Huggins was
in Grinnell un Grinnell»in—China day
in the fall of 1920 and prefaced lilr.
