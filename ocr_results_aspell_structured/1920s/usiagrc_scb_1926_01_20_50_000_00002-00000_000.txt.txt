SOCIET CHAIEPION.

it might not be sale [or Dr. Edward
Steiner to go to Europe again.

Those who read an account of Dl'.'

Steiner's speech before the Des
Moiues Chamber‘ of Commerce will re-
member that he took society severely
to task for many of its obnoxious
habits. Mr. Miles, who likes to be a
champion, came back with the state-

ment:

“He should praise society which he
says is no more immoral than it has
been, llor casting off hypocrisy instead
0! condemning it for being unashamed
of its sins.

“There is more fol-de-rol and mad-
die in the kind of education taught by
him and other self alleged superintelr
lectuals like him who are out of place
in American colleges than in any other
kind."

It is not the ﬁrst time that Milesl

has replied to it Steiner speech. In

fact, Steiner prohtt'llly would have cons

sidered his Des Moihes address a fail-.

ure if the editor of the Legiuuaiie had.
not taken exception to it.

Because Dr. Steiner points out cer-
tain faults it is no Sign that he be»
licves society is entirely bad. It is
his personal privilege to offer criti—

cism without diluting it with praise,l

This release of impulsc has demand-
cd a new ethics. The new ideal is
the release or impulse through inte-
gration. These new impulses must be
integrated, that is, they must e l-css
one's total life.

Sex can be integrated by being made
the medium through which the indi-
vidual is enlarged, through which lie
is made immortal in the lives of a new
generation. This is the meaning of
the doctrinc of love in Plato anti in
Jesus.

Education is not discipline, tasks,
books, examinations imposed from
without. Education is the discovery
land release of the impulse to know.
Education should make the world into
a laboratory of fascinating research.
It should make knowing an instrument
in a constantly expanding life.

TUESDAY.

Prof. E, E. T. Spencer discussed the
Irish situation in chapel Tuesday
morning. at all the topics broughtbe»
tore students there he chose one of
current interest in the newspapers
because, he said, ”Judging the tuture
by the past, there will always be an
Irish question.

His talk was a resume of the ques-
tion rather than an opinion on its
solution. He spoke or the invasion or
lreland by the Protestants, the conse-
quent stritc, and the agitation and de—
'veloplnent of Home Rule. A number
of Home Rule bills have been passed
in the past but none have apparently
presented a solution satisfactory to
the warring lactions consequently we
still have .. ln lrish question."

“Living Costs” will be the subject

be held tonight in the Little Theatre
at the quadrangle. The meeting will
start at 7:15 o'clock. Margaret Jones

It has long been argued that a per-‘

some appreciation of the ﬁne arts. A
knowledge of music, painting,
my and the classical languages has
been thought necessary for a cultured
man, If that conception is true, thcn
very few go out Irom this liberal arts
college, or any other, with a complete

education.

As a stimulus to art appreciation,

the Carnegie Foundation has made tcu

Gl'innell is one of them. Classes ill

it is interesting to note that ncarly
