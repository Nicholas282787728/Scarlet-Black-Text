SENIORS SPLIT HOME
MEET WITH FRESHMEN

Vinsel Wins Half Senior Points
And Wins Individual Honors
In Annual Home Classic.

This week and the past weekend
mark the opening of'tbe spring sports
season in real earnest on the local

campus. With the home meet a thing
of the past, and Paula's record at
Penn still in the minds of the sport
world, and the Drake dual, soph-fresh-
man dual, intramural baseball, the
freshman Missouri Valley telegraphic
meet, to say nothing of golf, and olha
er minor sports coining, local fans
will have their fill or sports gossip
in the near future.

Perhaps the best record made this
year is’ that of Paulu at the Penn rec
lays, where he was hardly nosed out
ol.’ first place in [he special hundred
yaid dash by Farrell of Brooklyn col—
lege. The time of the race was slow.
only 10 2 , but this was due to the
poor condition of the track and the
generally poor weather conditions.
Paulo got off to a slow start and was
about a yard and a half behind at the
fifty yard in- He gained rapidly
and caused some discussion among
the judges as to which runner broke
the tape:

Home Meet Divided

The Home meet Saturday was divid-
ed between the seniors and freshman.
It was at first reported that the sen—
iors had nosed out the yearlings by a
two point lead, but upon'refel'i'iug
the scoring to “Doc” Huff it was de
cided that another place should be al-
lowed in the relay .and this brought
the freshmen even with the seniors.
The two leaders had 54 points each,
and the sophs came third with 42
points, the juniors fourth with 15.

For the fourth time in his four
years in college, Vinsel. all-round 1921
athlete won individual honors, with
25 points to his credit, which helped
materially in his class score. The
most interesting race in the meet,
was the finish of the 440, which was
awarded to Winter, '21, and Mcllrath.
’24, in a dead heat of 52 2-5. This
,ivas the only event of the meet which

OUTCOME OF MEET HARD

(By Sports Editor)

Local track followers are looking
forward with interest to the coming
dual meet with Drake university next
Saturday because it will be the first
opportunity to see the entire Pioneer
squad in action. While it is not the
wriLei"s intention to he too Dmimistic
it seems as if Crinnell should win
the meet. However, it will be far
l‘lolu all easy \l‘iu.

Barring a ﬂuke Paulu should win
thc (lashes with ease and Dougliei-ty
should annex his share of points in
thc distancv grind. It looks as if the
440 will be seriously disputed if Pat-
ttlson of Drake enters it as he runs
a consistent race in that event. Vin-
sel will be forced to extend himself
considerably in the high sticks but he
stands an exceptionally good chance
to break the tape in that race.

I! the short relay team can run as
last as it did at the Drake relays

Grinncll should finish about twenty
yards in the lead. our mile relay
team has not been tested and it is
hard to forecast the outcome. At any
rate the coming meet will be won by
the school that can collect the most
seconds and thirds. In looking over

looks as if Griniicll had the edge on
