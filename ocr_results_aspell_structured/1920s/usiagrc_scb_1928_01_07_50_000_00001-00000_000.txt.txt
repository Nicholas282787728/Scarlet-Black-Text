GIVE AGGIES FAST GAIVE
\

Sooner Score Is 40 to Z1; Aggie:
A3 to 38 In Much Tighter
Contest Thursday.

Invthe second home appearance
against Oklahoma university, Grinuell
showed more fight and determination
than in the first home encounter, but
was defeated 40 to 21, again due to
superior height.

Holt, giant Sooner center was able
to hold the ball away from any of
the Pioneers. He was ably assisted
by Lecrone, Churchill, Norriss, three
other men topp’ing six feet, and
Drake, fiveefooteten speed demon.

The Pioneers showed a better de-
fense than they did against the Chi —
homa Aggies. Lovejoy has high point
’man for the Pioneers with ten points
and was only one point behind
Churchill, tire Sooner forward, for
high point man of the game. The Pio-‘
necr tenm'did not have any outstand
ing star, neither did Oklahoma. Both
quints works together nicely, and
both showed a well organized attack.

Aggies, Grinnoll may.

.in Grinnell‘s first home game Thurs
day night the team looked like the
best that has represented Grinncll in
Missouri valley basketball for quite a
while. The Pioneers :llaslied a brile
liant offense and a fairly tight de-
fense. only to he nosed out by the 0k
lahoma Aggies by the score of 43 to
as.

The Aggies won the game on ac»
count of their advantage in height
alone for the Pioneer basketeers were
much faster, and displayed a much
'more organized attack. Collins. giant
Aggie center, towered above every
other man on the floor and was dead
ly on under basket shots because of
his size. Wright, Aggie forward was
uncanny in his basket shooting. ire
secured eight field goals to be time
her -up to Coggeshall for high point
man of the evening,

Team Is Speedy.

The whole Grinnell team seemed to
function quite well on account of its
speed. However it was almost im-
possible to keep the Aggies from
shots under the basket, as they towerr
ed at least four inches over every
Grinnell player. Coggeshall was high
point man (if/the \galne, sinking five
field goals and seven free throws for
a total of seventeen points. The
Pioneers were deadly on free throws,
sinking twelve out of fourteen at-
tempts. '

The game was fast from start to
finish, the Aggies scoring a field goal
on the tipoff on a neatly executed
pass from Wright to King. From that
time on the lead alternated. Just be-
fore the halt ended, the Aggies took
a spurt and the score was 26 to 13 in
their favor at the rest period, When
the second half began Grinnell rallied
and came within three points of the
Aggies The Pioneers threatened the
score for the remainder of the game.

Tells Delegates College People
Add to Intellectual Life

Despite Criticism,

“Although the widespread criticism
of'college and university life today
is a good thing, the critics should re~
alize that. despite the large class of
Students who waste their college
years there are still many college
graduates who (ire contributing riclle
[y to the intellectual lifc of society."
This was the theme stressed by Free
sidet J. H. T. Main last week in an
address before the third annual culi-
Sress of the Student Federation of
America at the University of Nebras-
kn.

College “Flirt-scum Cross.spctiorr.

Those who criticize modern secon—
dary education, according to Presie
dent Main” should consider, that,
since all the world iras in late years
taken to going to college, college life
today represents a cross—section of
the world and that nowadays many
idlers and snobs are bound to creep
into college along with those who
seek in education‘ to open to them—
selves the true riches of life. College
is the best place to change many of
these same snobs to useful citizens.

“As for the religious problems of
college students. every student must
realize that as long as creeds obscure
the true religion underneath them
there is bound to he a conflict be-
twecn science and religion,” (le-
clared President Main. “Such cone
ventional religion cannot hope to
hold the rising generation and that
[act the theologians must/ accept as
inevitable."

Place to study Evolution.

“There is no better place to study
eveolution than in college and unis
versity," stated President Main, "for
if the theory is proven false it will
bc_ discarded; if it is shown to be
true beyond doubt, it will remain the
basis of scientific thought despite any
hostile decree of church or state."

The congress which is the third of
its kind. was well attended, many de—
legates being present from east of
the'Rocky mountains. The first con-
ference two years ago was held at
Princeton university, when the World
Court was the topic of discussion.

Stress Arts and Professional Work
At Journalism Teachers’ Convention

The necessity of both libel-a1 al‘ts
and professional education for jour—
nalism was emphasized at the Annual
canvenliun 0f the American Associa-
tion of Teachers of Journalism, which
met in Iowft City, December 29-30.
Grinnell college was represented by
Wayne Gard, assistant professor of
journalism.

MI‘. Gill'd reports that. the number
01' journalism teachers in American
colleges and Illilve ities, which in
1912 was 31, had increased to 430 in
1927. Most journalism schools and
departments are \Vuyking toward lac-
Coming professional graduate schools
comparable to the best medical and
law schools. In tllirtyrlive states
newspaper organizations are co-oper—
ating actively with schools or der
partmcuts of journalism, finding [in-
Sitious for El“ recomendcll graduates,

Statistics shown ﬁll, the convention
ranked Grinnell high among liberal

 

arts colleges which offer journalism
courses, hilt Gl'illuell’s position would
be much higher if her journalism
courses were divorced from the nose
lish department and organized as an
independent department. it was madc
clear at the convention that journal-
ism tcachcrs regard the inclusion of
journalism courses in English depart-
rnents as a distinctly antiquated or—
rapgemcnt, At some universities—
suclr as Stanford and Wisconsin7
whcrc thcrc are groupings of dcpart-
meats, journalism is included as one
of the social sciences, and has no di-
rect connection with the English de-
hurtment,

Tho Tanager, which was among
the college publications on display at
the convention, was the object of
much favorable comment, and was
regarded by convention officers and
delegates as the most outstanding mae
some of its type.

The keen competition and hard
playing or the intei'rclass basketball
series makes it difficult to select.on
all—tournament five. Although the
yearling team earned a’clenr champ
pionship by winning all its games and
the juniors and sophomores were de—
finitely placcd second and third, the
former losing one game and the latter
winning one, most of the games were
in doubt until the closing moments.

Flashy forwards were plentiful this
year, Minier, Gray, Struble and De
Long were chosen from a half doe
zcn men who might have received the
honor. Ruff. a freshman. would pro-
bably have been placed on one of the
teams had he played in all the games.
But he sprained his ankle in his tirst
game and did notappear again lln~
til the last. l

Gray outstanding Forward.

Gray, the junior captain, was her
haps the outstanding forward of the
series. Besides being high point man,
he was the most consistent scorer,
making from twelve to eighteen
points in each contest. He shot from
all angles and all distances with the
same success. Although DeLong was
second high scorer of the series,
chiefly through his rampage against
the seniors, lliinior is given prefer-
encc over him for a first team berth
because of his greater consistency.
While lllillier’s playing totalled less
than two games, because substitu-
tions in the freshman lineup were
free, it was responsible for much of
the year-ling scoring. Struble was the
main cog in the senior offense. hence
his mention on the "albinism." _

Humphrey was easily the ‘outstaud-
ing ccntcr. He usually got the up
off and was often the one to make a
basket, Like Minier, he was often
missing from the freshman line up
because many substitutions were
made, and, likc him, he‘was a scoring
ace when he was playing. Smiley al-»
so played a nice game at center. Had
he played the opening game he might
have been considered over Humphrey.
Although he was shorter than the
yearling, he frequently got the tip—off.
In the final game, he was a leader in
the rally which nearly defeated the
juniors.

Gout] Guards l’lelitiiul.

Although excellent guards were
plentiful in the-tournament, it was
not hard to choose the pair which
have been placed on the first five.
Douglas, the freshman captain, and
Locke .a junior. were the chief rea—
sons why thcir teams were not
scored on heavily. Douglas with For
suson. who is placed on the second
team, made a defense no offense ef—
fectively pcnetrated. The only rally
made against the freshman came
when this pair was not playing. Locke
was the junior defense. Although he
played all over the floor, going down
to shoot a basket and coming back
to see that his opponents did‘ not
scoreI he still maintained a Close
shard. ,

It seems far-fetched to call Hall-
stead a guard, but that is what he is.
He was the high point than for the
seniors in one game, and scored his
share of the points in the other two.
but he did all of his shooting from
the center of the floor. i-lis guarding
was not brilliant, but on the theory
that a good offense is the best de-
fense, he is given a place on the sc-
cond team.
