THE CONVENTION.

In behalf of the student body or
the college. The Scarlet and Black
wishes to extend a welcome to the
visiting high school men and women
who are here to attend the second
annual cunvention.ot the lows High
School Press Association.

Already the good effects of ﬁle
organization are evident in the in-
creased interest shown throughout the
state, as witnessed by the increased
of delegates over last
and

enrollment
year's convention,
there is evinced an eagerness to hear
and discuss the problems of journals
ism that confront the various papers.
Everywhere there is a desire to co—
operatein and to coordinate the work
o the various papers and interests in
an etort to solve these problems.
Individualism is a splendid thing in
its place, but it is becoming more and
more evident that only by cooperation
can the high school papers of the state
progress in keeping with the other
Dhases of the work as it is being car-
ried on today". There is a very dell—
nite place in the high school for the
local paper. whether it be newspaper
or magazine. As in every other ﬁeld,
the student and professional journal—

everywhere

ists can play a vital part in moulding
public opinion‘ and in creating senti—
ment. It is the question of how best
to -carry on this work that is the
cause and the theme of the present
convention.

The Scarlet and Black is glad to see
the high school press organization on
the campus again. and hopes that the
delegates will find the meeting a suc-
cessful and helpful one. Grinnell’s
doors are constantly open and Grlnnell
students an the service of the guests.

TOWN AND COLLEGE.

The much mooted question of the
relation that the town should ploy to
the .college in communities such as
Grinnell has again been revived altho
in somewhat different form. The
Amerlcan City Bureau of New York,
at the request of the chamber of Com-
merce of the United states, has under-
taken to conduct an investigatlon of
conditions in the average college town,
with particular reference to the rela-

ltions oi townspeople and students. and
to suggest to the Chambers of Com-
merce ways and means in which
these may be improvedi
The Bureau, in introducing this mat-
ter to the individual communities.
says in part: “Too often in the post
the college has been simply an institu—
tion. in, hut not 0!, the community,
a group of buildings to which the local
inhabitants “could point with pride,"
—but still an institution totally up-
lmown to the great maiority of the
inhatltants and in turn knowing and
carlng little about the life In the com-
munity in which it is situated.”
Gn'nnell Is particularly fortunate in
the conditions discussed by this ques—
tionnaire which is making the rounds
of similar institutions. Academic
isolation has long been unpopular hero
and the community and the college
have cooperated in many Joint enter
prises that have resulted beneﬁcially
for both groups, The conspicuous
example of this close cooperation be-
tween townspeople and college is
tound in the support given by the for-
mor to the Grinnell Endowment Move—
ment which resulted in the pledging of

dollars to the local fund. 0n the
other hand, the college has been active
in supporting town enterprises and
has taken an interest in community
problems and their solution.

However, despite these encouraging
facts, there has been a feeling that a
closer cooperation socially and in busi—

intermingling is being developed by the

iarity with individual firms, while the

anceshlps by satisfactory service, nta

that will reach this particular class
of trrde. An important step in this
line was taken at Amos last spring
when the commercial club of that city
and the leaders of the various frater—
nities got together in an open forum
discussion of ways and means of pro-
moting closer fellowship. Some such
movement might be beneﬁcial here.
