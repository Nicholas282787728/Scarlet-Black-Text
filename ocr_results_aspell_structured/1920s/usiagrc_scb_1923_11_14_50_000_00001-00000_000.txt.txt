International Politics Authority
Stresses Fine Spirit of
League and 'Court.

ASKS THAT AMERICA
JOIN WORLD COURT

Twu Lectures Give Large Crowd
Vivid Account of League
And Court Affairs.

The spirit of Geneva, rvorld capital
.and home of the League of Nations,
is a genuinely disinterested and en-
thusrastic spirit of cooperation, acA
cording to Miss Sarah Wambaugh.
who lectured at chapel Tuesday mor—
ning on the League of Nations, and
at eight o'clock that evening on the
World Court.

Miss Wambaugh, who has been
considered an authority on inter»
national pol' ics for a number of
years, was for a time a member of
the Administrative commissions Secs
tlon of the Secretariat of the League
of Nations, and has been intimately
associated with the League since the
time of its establishment,

Emphasizes Cosmopolitanism

In her chapel lecture Miss Wam-
baugh explained in detail the organ-
ization of the League, and emphas-
ized its extreme cosmopolitanism,
naming the various nationalities rep-
resented on the committees. One of
her most striking statements was the
simple declaration that all the nations
of the world are members of the Leh-
gue of Nations, with the exception of
Ger-many, Turkey, Russia, Mexico, and
the United States. These, five are
the only nations in the world who
may still go to war whenever they
Please.

In her lecture Tuesday evening,
Miss Wambaugh paid tribute to
Roosevelt, Root, Ghosts, and Wilson,
saying that these four Americans
were very influential in bringing a
World Court and League of Nations
'into practical being, and that we, as
Americans, are being kept out of
our inheritance. The present Lea.-
gue of Nations is the first actual.
practical experiment in political sci-
ence.

Urges Value of Colin

Miss Wambaugh, as a student of
international law, admits that the
League and the Court are far from
perfect. But more than once she
urged us to realize that we can cor-
rect their defects from the inside
much more easily than we can tear
down the organism which is adresdy
at work, and try to substitute some—
thing in its place.

In that connection she attacked Scn-
ator Borab's agitation for a new
Court with stinging, if goodrhumcred
scarccsm. Pointing out the axis
tencc of the obligatory iur otion
clause in the present World' Court
smote, she explained the possrbility
that America might, by consenting to
join the Cour-t on that condition only,
pcrsuado all the great powers to
agree to compulsory jurisdiction—an
achievement which would be of imr
mense importance in helping both the
League of Nations and the World
Court to function more completely.

Asks U. r . Entrance

Miss Wambaugh told of the eight
cases that have come before a the
Court, emphasizing the fact that its
decisions have been accepted un-
questionlugly by the disputing part»
ies, and ending her discussion with
a direct, searching, almost dramatic
apnea, "Why are we not in that
Court?"

The Corfu affair and other unite
recent events were explained in de-
tail. Since her return to America a
few weeks ago. Miss Wambaugh has
as yet lectured only in Cleveland and
St, Louis, and her plans were to re-
turn to the cast via Chicago, immedr
lately after leaving Grinnell. Thus
Grinucll audiences are among the
first to hear her unusually vivid, rcai-
istic accounts of the League of Na-
tions at work, up to and including
September, 1923.

In glancing through the Gllunell
Alumni Reg 'stcr, it is extremely gritt—
riiyrng to note the number of Grillllcll
graduates who have really achieved
success in the \nrious fields they en—
ter-ed after leaving college.

In view of the fact that as a college
We have always stressed journalism
for women as well as for men, it is
encouraging to observe the number of
Grinuell women who have made a
place for themselves in that partic—
ular field. The women mentioned in
the iollowing paragraphs by no means
constitute the entire list, but are
merely examples of the women jour-
mtlists Grinnell has produced in the
past.

Susan Whitcornb Hassell, who was
graduated as long ago as 1877, wrote
many interpretive studies of liter—
ature. After moving to Washington,
she complied and edited in 1916 a

rUnhandicapped by Injuries, the
Pioneers Improve in the
Grid Fundamentals

Unhondicapped by injuries from the
Kansas game last Saturday, the rion-
cers are working hard for the next
contest with Coe this wcekl. Several
changes were made in the‘linerup of
the varsity in their scrimmage against
-the yearlings yesterday afternoon.

An hour-s signal drill was held on
Monday after-noon in a drizzling rain.
'chter-duy Coach Elward sent his men
through a good scrimmage with the
freshman, both defensive ‘and offen-
sive being used against the first year
seleven.

Scrimmage Brings Shifts ~

Benz, who made such a good‘ show—
ing in the Kansas contest, has taken
the place of Winters at right end in
the workouts this week. Wing has
been shifted to the other end from
halfback. C. Kingery is taking the
place left vacant by Wing in the back-
field. The good showing made by
“Cappy” Jones in the aura last Satv
urday has apparently satisfied Coach
Elward, for .Iones was calling the
signals for the varsity in scrimmage
}:stcrduy tcrnuou. .

A noticeable improvement was
made in the Aggie game over the type
of football played against the Bull-
dogs. The tackling and blocking
was better but the team still seems
to be weak on interference. Coach
Elward will undoubtedly send his
men against the trash this afternoon
for he realizes that the men need all
the practice that they can get if they
are to make a good showing Satur-
day.

Music lovers of Gl’innell will'bave
the privilege of hearing Hungary’s
greatest violinist when Emil Tclnmnyi
appears in concert in Her-rick Chapel,
evening. The, New York
Journal declares "Telmanyi is the
most exciting experience one has had
since Kreisler but-st. upon America."

The Hungarian virtuoso is making
his second tour of the United States.
Last. season he astounded audiences
with his colossal technique and
marvelous fluency. His playing has
all the fire and lmiiginillinn of his
race. ,

Lavish has been the critical praise
heaped upon Telmanyi’s playing of
Bach‘s music. To the works of that
master he brings delightful purity of
DE tone, pitch and freedom of bowing.
