New llrpart ient Good

The new book review dehartmeut
makes an auspicious start. ltliriiini
hicNallr's review ot "My iloi-tal Ens
eniy," by Willa Canter, is unusually
successful. Miss licNally’s style is
mature and her judgment wood. Mr

Wayne Gnrd's review or Braithwaite's,

“Anthology or Magazine Verse"
throws out some provocative suggest-
ions on tiie inalring ot this particular-
collection. The same writer has a
review of Ruth siiclrows "Iowa Ins
tenors" and Paul G. Norris Jr. coli—
trihntes a conventional review of
James nor-man Hall's, “On the Stream
or Travel." The chief criticism of
this department is that most or the
books reviewed are old. Book re-
views done as these are should have
some interest as news Three or
these tour were hubiished hetore
Christmas.

Neither the May Tanager nor any
future edition will set the magazine
world zirfii'e. It will niit swamp
Menelren with remorse at his jibes
shout iowa culture, neither n i it
bring students running to attiliate
themselves with this enlightened colv
lege. But compare the Tanager with
other college literary publications, and
we have reason to be proud of it. If
the editors continue the present pol-
icy of encouraging student contrir
butions at all times yet accepting ma—
terials troni outsiders to lreep the
standard up, another year will see
further improvements. Above all let
us have material which says sonier
thing. In the past the much of it has
been urged by a sophomorie ambition
to be literai, into merely marking

' lent time and getting nowhere.
