was not planned, nor were the actors
provided with solid rnhhcr, cloud-
burst proof costumes. Consequently
the Senior pilgrimage took place with»
in the dry, comioriable walls of A. R
H., and imagination played a large
part.

Ray Hare acted as chief guide and
Dick Steiner, poet laurete, announcA
ed the arrival of the company at each
particular spot, by appropriate verse.
The buildings were also well labelled
and designated with signs. At Chi-
cago hell, Prexy addressed the august

dents at Music hall, song the classical

their message was somewhat doubted.

and Dorothy Smith sang oi their re-

Fred Benz talked on athletics on a

Hare, Mark Enturf, and Harvey
Waugh furnished music at the Dorms.
and Dean Nollen and Proiessor Lev/ell
closed with the farewell speeches at
the Dean Nollen home, and A. R. H.
The only real part 01 the journey was
the trip to the Faculty club for tea
yet this lost pilgrimage over the in-

have been tempted to come to the con-
clusion nf Ecclesiastes that the more
we know, the less solidity we see in

Mr. Laval! stressed humility as the

To this discovery of our present ignore

we may be it We desire to make the
effort, and the further certainty that
the kingdom ot God is within us.

“This is something like what a col—
