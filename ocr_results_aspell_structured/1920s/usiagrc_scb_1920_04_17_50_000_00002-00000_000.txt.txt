Student Governing Bodies

Before the era of the quadrangle

arid the dormitories the tundamental

the lines or class. The‘ classes were

more or less close organizations.
Inti‘arnlul'iil athletics were carried out
among the various class teams.

The class organization also held an
important place in the social lite o:

The college calendar had

events for each class during the year.
The Freshman Formal, the Junior Kid
Party and various other traditional
class aftaii-s were landmarks in the
social calendar.

one of the most important reasons
for this supremacy of the class organ-
ization lay in the fact that it was the
only system which included every stu-

The Dormitories and the Quadrangle
have introduced anew system which
also includes every student in college.
This organization was made all inclu-

We have two all inclusive systems
of organization existing side by side.
Is there a. place for both and if there
is what is the place each should us

It is evidently impossible to do away

astic basis 0: organization of the 001*

alumni burly.

It is equally impossible to do away
with the definitol'y and quadrangle

If the dormitory plan is to
be a success it is necessary that avmar

Both systems must exist, therefore,

The next question is in regard to

A few years

college dormitories have witnessed ‘a
remarkable breaking down or the class
organization and a strengthening or

when the student Council was or-

NOW both the Dormitories and the
Quadrangle have their own governing

bodies. At the piuadrangle there is

the Women’s League Board and at'

the Dormitories the Men‘s Senate, The
Men's Senate is the representative govr

and the Women's League Bneard holds
the same position among the Women.
In other words these two bodies serve
the whole student body.

dent Council which is also a repre—

students. And yet there is no corre—
