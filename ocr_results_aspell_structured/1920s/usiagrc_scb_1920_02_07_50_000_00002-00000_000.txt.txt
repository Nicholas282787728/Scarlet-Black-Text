Practically everybody, even down to
the scientist, has an appreciation lol-
the romantic. That is why the pub-
lishers oi novels and short stories are
able to support their tamilies.

We rend the hart-owing tale of the
adolescent beauty rescuing his light
0' love from the hands or the desnei-atc
and unscrupulous villain, disguised
behind a set of blaclt mustaohios,
heave a sigh and wonder why we are
doomed to a prosiac life,

And yet the most common things
or the most ordinary existence are
tilled with romance ﬁghting to get
out.

“Behold, if you have all knowledge

Lovell in an alticle entitled “The
Wisdom 0k Foolishness," published in

writes prolcssol-

tlic Gl'lnncll lteriew lor December.
In this issue of thc searlct and
Black the Giirincll chapter or Sigma
Delta Chi announces plans for get-
ting out a Grinnell humorous publi-
cation.

It’s avowed purpose is to present a
compendium of the wit and humor or
lite in general and (lunch college
life in particular. In other words,
the Sigma Delta Chi brother-s pro-
pose a vest pocket cdition ol foolish-
nes i t

It you will sutter us to draw a pic-
ture, we would call ”foolishness" the
seasoning of lite, without which our
existance would he but a ﬂat and
tasteless tlrlng. Foolishness it
occurs from day to day, without term
or organization, we would liken to

as

the salt licks which nature scattered
over the country Without rhyme or
