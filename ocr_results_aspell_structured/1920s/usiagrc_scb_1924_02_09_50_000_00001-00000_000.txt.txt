“The Social Implication of the

Last Address.

FORMIDABLE SUBJECTS
TREATED WITH EASE

Sustained Interest Has Greeted
Fellowship ‘Conference from
the Grinnell Campus,

Gates memorial lecture, "The Soci l
Iullllication oi the Idea. ol God.‘Y closV
ed the tenth anuuul Fellowship Con~
Iel'ence 01' the Congregational mi
ters of Iowa here yestcrfla).

Dean sherrys lectures kept up a
sustained interest among the student
body and they were well attended
throughout the week. The consensus
aﬁcampus opinion seems to be that
Gl'inuell has been Very fortunate in
its opportunity to hear Dr. Sperry, a
speaker of matured intelligence, lib~
eral and constructive religious views,
and a broad range of sympathies.

The theological and philosophical
formidahility of his subjects melted
before the intensely human and con-
versatioual manner in which they
were presented. His ability to draw
on a. vast fund of illustrations, the
humor with which he varied the more
serious Portions of his addresses were
largely responsible for the total im-
pression created.

Prof. if. .I. Bradshaw's concluding
lecture, "JESUS: A Portrait in Oil,"
Dean .I. S. Nollen's address, “The
Question in the Modern World.” and
Miss Clara J. Andersen's talk on “The
Church and Community Recreation"
were all given Thursday.

The Fourth Grates Lecture.

Dean Spe 'y delivered his fourth
Gates Memorial Lecture before a. large
audience in Herrick Chapel Wednes-
day evening. on the subject: "Christian
Rights and Duties".

starting with a scene from Shaw’s
latest stage success “Joan” in which
the slip of a girl stands before the
mass of authority of church and state
represented by her inquisitors, Dean
Sperry declared that this slime atru 4
ﬁle of the solitary single soul for its
own rights against the social forces of
the World is going on every day,

We have come to look on our rights
as God given, he said. It is second nil-
ture to regard them as fundamental as
a premise, a point of departure, u.
platitude.

These rights originate in several
sanctions according to Dean Sperry.
In the first place there is the biologi-
cal sanction which holds that living is
making good your rights and that if
you don't make them good you must
die.

The second sanction is recognized
by the protestant denominations in
the right to go straight to God with
our problems. This sanction is a pro-
duet of the reformation and claims
as its source the blood of the martyrs.
In this connection he remarked that
the great weakness of the Congreg
tional church was its extreme insis-
tence on its rights,

The third source of our rights grows
out o! the political theory that the
purpose of government is to guarantee
the individual the enjoyment of his
rights. This individualistic view finds
its expression in the Declaration of
Independence and the French Declar-
ation of the Rights of Man.

The fourth source or Sanction is to
be found in the economic order with
its rights of money. property and time,

This doctrine of rights as it has
been applied to democracies has been
a failure in the opinion of Dean Sper-
ry. He quoted Bryce as saying that
there is nothing in the moral order of
right Without a correlative duty.

Carrying this idea over into the field
of the Christian religion he said that
the doctrine of rights never occurred
to Jesus but that the Messiahshlp and
the idea. of the fatherhood of God hld
been used to support the Views of
those who believed in our inalienable
rights.

Jesus, Dean Sperry said, made good
his rights by sitting the long way
around, by the indirect Path of his du-
ties. He taught that the way to get
your rights was by doing your duty.

What ls needed in the world today,
he said, is the Christian doctrine of
the long way round. He closed by
characterizing the professions as lu-
terested in their duties whlla the bus-
iness world is interested in its rights.

Fifth Gates Hemorhl Lecture

“Creation and Criticism" was the
subject of the third Gates Memorial
Lecture which was delivered in Her-
rick Chanel Thursday mornlng.

Dean Sperry introduced his subject
by comparing the old and new religion
to Works of art. The older religion is
portrayed in two dimensions. has 3

Eighty-ﬁve Musicians Form the
Minneapolis Symphony to
Play in Chapel.

When Gl'illnell students hear the
Minneapolis symphony Orchestra in
Herrick Chapel tonight at eight o'clock,
they will hear one of the finest orches-
tras in the United states, one that
compares favorably with the great or-
chestral organizations of the world.

There are eight-five musicians in the
orchestra, including the very best of
native and foreign artists. The ore
chestru is in its twentieth season.
Having established itself as a civic
institution, it has focused the attention
of the musical world upon the North
west as it has never been focused
before.”

Well Supported

Minneapolis supports its orchestra
with a $124,000 annual guarantee
fund, Since its fourth season the 01‘s
chestral has traveled extensively and
”with the exception of a few states on
tho atlantic seaboard had visited all
the other states in the Union. Their
tours have not been undertaken for
profit, but in the majority of case:
by the expressed invitation of the
music loving public of the cities vis-
ited. The orchestra annually gives
about two hundred concerts including
the tour concerts."

It is necessary to enlarge the plat
form of Herrick chapel to ncoomodate
the large organization. No single ad~
missions are to be sold, since it is
evident that there will be a record ate
tendanee.

EURIIPEAN SRNRIIIRNS
SANRIRII RISIIIISSER

Kessler, Distinguished German,
Pictures the Sorrows and
Hopes of Europe.

Beginning with a v id picture of
the sordid chaos of Europe of today
and ending with an idealistic hope of
what it may be tomorrow, Count Kess-
ler, distinguished German diplomat,
delivered an address in f-lcrrick chapel
Thursday night which must rank as
one of the outstanding features 0!
this year's ample schedule of lectures,

Frankly, and with no millcing of
wci s or evasion of issues, Count
Kcssler endeavored to present the
facts oi the European situation as
they are seen by thinking inch in Ger-
many. This angle of» approach, on—
known to the average person, proved
to be of unusual interest and inform—
atwc imnortauce.

The Count opened his speech by at
tempting to show the different spirit
which prevails in America and in
Europe. He stated that the prevailing
American spirit is one of peace
in contrast to the European spirit _of
armed confusion. He then went 'on
to trace the different phases of Europ—
enn life of the present day which are
the results of its present chaotic con-
dltions. .
Currency Falls

The first of these unhappy condl»
tious is the sudden fall of the value
of currency during the war and its
steady fall since that time. In Ger-
many, the Count stated, there was
actually a feeling of relief when the
mark was stabilized at four- trillion
marks to the dollar,

This fall in the Value of currency
has precipitated another disastrous
consequence in that external trade is
practically at a stand—still due to the
uncertain and unfavorable financial
exchanges. The second result of the
present state of European affairs is
universal unemployment with its at-
tendant troublesome and threatening
problems.

German Diplomat Prolongs Stay
to Satisfy Interest of Grin—
nell Audience.

"The Germans have paid ,000,000,-
000 gold marks l'epclratloils to the ails
lied countries so far," stated Count
Kesslar in a “round table" discussion
held Friday morning in the A. R. H.
auditorium which was attended Ily cu
proximately four hundred students
and faculty members. He added that
this was five times as much as the
French paid the Germans in the same
length or time alter the war in 1870.

Count Kessler expressed his belief
in a World court as a necessary of"
sanitation to core for the settlement
of our international economic prob-
lems, brought about by the develop»
Inent of international trusts. “Even
the United States has not enough
power to control them," he added.

He also stated that he thought the
League of Nations was the right
foundation for the realization of a
united world, but that the league was
too much at a political organization,
and did not lay enough emphasis on
the economic work. “The tearing
down of the structure of tile League
of Nations would not aid in obtaining
a United States of Europe."

Through the influence of Professor
Charles E. dene‘, Count Kesslel- was
persuaded to prolong his stay here
and to conduct this discussion with
the purpose in mind of helping Grin-
nell people to better understand
Count Kessler's position, and also to
help the count to learn more of the at~
titude of the people here in the mid
die west toward Germany and her
problems.
