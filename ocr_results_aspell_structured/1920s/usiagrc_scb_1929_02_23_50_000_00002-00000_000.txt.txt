SENIOR IN’W‘ZIIEST IN COJDIEN "Elli-INT.

The SCARLET AND BLACK heartily endorses the
ideas in the communication at Mr. Natlack. published in
this issue, that this commencement should be made (life
ferent by active participation and interest of the senior
class. That the class has not entirely lost interest is
evidenced by the quick action taken over the statement
that a move was being made to abolish senior chapels.

But it is by lack ot attendance at the chapels that
such a movement might be necessary. Scnior chapels
and commencement are primarily the affairs of the sen
ior class. The increasing tendency during the past years
to ignore this fact. has accounted for much or the tect-
ing that commencement is not enough concerned with the
seniors.

Many traditions are certain in the course of time to
pass and so it is with many traditions connected with

has done much to create general interest in the present

ARE THE SENIORS CONSISTENTl

it might be well for the senior Class to recall the
pledge unanimously adopted at a meeting last semester-,'
As we under-stood the pledge. the members of the class
pledged themselves to attend chapel at least twice a.
wcelr. Any- observer would note that the Women are
mithrully attending. However, the representation of men
is woefully small. Can it he that the senior men had the
duties incumbent on a tourth year strident so burden-
some that they are unable to attend chapel regularly?
Perhaps their irregularity in attendance is an oversight.
Whatever the Cause, we suggest the senior men remem-
her their pledge.

ii the seniors are to set an example tor the under--
clcssmeu, it behooves them to practice consistency/7m
the matter or pledges. There is little inspiration {or a
speaker to face several runs of empty seats. a section
irom which the underclztssmen are excluded. The sew
ior class constitutes n group which should be the must
receptive and intelligent portion of the audience. How-
ever, it bloclr of empty seats is the monument to that
group. Vi’hy reserve such a. section?

an idea. I want to see it made bigger
and better. With many others I am

make its iinal days on the campus,
days long to be remembered,

I deplore the indifference which
some senior Classes have shown to-
ward senior chapel and other senior
events in the last tew years. it any
thing can he done to restore them to
.1 place at dignity and value I am one
who will be glad to help.

Action taken last {all adding two
members at the senior class to the
general commencement committee
was precisely for the purpose of
arousing senior interest in commence
merit affairs, The class of 1929 has a
splendid opportunity to re-instate senr
icr events as part of the commence-
ment tradition. Since an entirely new
Commencement schedule is to be tried
this year it might be a goon Lhing lor
the trainers ot 1929 to make a real
study or senior participation, tor Com-
mCucemellt is after all primarily a
senior event and it is only through
the lodliierence or senior classes in
the past that some uf its features
have been discarded.

 

in blithe honchdlance toward [acts
your reporter simply iollowed the ex-
ample cl some of the world's great
est newspapers, but it put a lot of
friends of 1929, including myself, in
the hole and we ask your help in get-
ting us out.

Sincerely.
