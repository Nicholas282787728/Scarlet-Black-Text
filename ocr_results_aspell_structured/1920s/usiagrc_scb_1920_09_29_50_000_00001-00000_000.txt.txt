Dorm Labor Situation
Becoming More
Acute.

The dorms are having little labor
troubles all their own!

it seems that the scarcity of fresh»
man labor in one of the dorm hails
inspired the members of that build-
ing to draft n few of the youngsters
from the building of one of the broth
crlioods nirthcr down the line. This
drafting of precious labor didn't seem
to please the leaders of the prep
building, and a delegation was imme-
diately instituted to effect c rescue.
Being unsuccessful, however, they
made lots of uultind remarks about
the “freshmen swipers", and returned
tor a council ot war, only to be fol-
lowed a minute or two later by the
entire membership of the abductors
in battle spir-

:‘ltel exchanging a lew more com-
plimeutary remarks ttie abductor-s i-
