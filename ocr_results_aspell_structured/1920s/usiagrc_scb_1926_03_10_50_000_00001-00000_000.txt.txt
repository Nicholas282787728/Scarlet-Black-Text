The abil y of Sydney Thompson,
who appears in. a recital in l—Ierrick
chapel Friday night, is cemented on
by the New York newspapers after
her recent appearance there in the
Punch and Judy Theatre.

According to the New York Times,
“the appearance of Sydney Thompson,
an entertainer whose work in New
York has attracted considerable inter-
est elsewhere, tool: place at the Punch
and Judy Theatre yesterday, and was
the means of introducing to this city
a new idea in dramatic monologues.
Miss Thompson's work shows unusual
talent." -

lids Gloou voice

The New York Globe compliments
Miss Thompson, ”A young actress of
unusual distinction and many admiral
hle qualities was disclosed in Miss
Thompson at the Punch and Judy
Theatre yesterday afternoon. Most
admirable of her qualities is that she
is very good to look at, She has also
a good voice, a ﬁne discretion in the
use of it, a remarkable sense of val—
ues and graceful motions. Givcn a
part she would be All actress of rare
power."

The Tribune goes further and says,
“Miss Sydney Thompson is a vcry ca»
pable young woman who puts on
whole plays vund takes all the parts
without once leaving the stage to
adopt a disguise."

Billlntls llnngn in Subject

The old ballads, which Miss Thump»
son presents, range in subject from
the quaint humor and arch tenderness
of the English to the Violent action
and, often, bloodthirsty denouements
of the Slavic. They include religious
ballads which arc profoundly rever—
ent, or broadly ll'onical, and love bal-
lads which are sincere ol‘ satirical,
but always romantic.

Miss Thompson was very enthusL
astically received when she visited
Grinnell a few years ago to give a
program of this kind. People who
remember her previous visit say that
she is one of the most adept readers
who is now appearing on the lecture
platform,

Miss Thompson's program is as fol-
lows:

TWO original plays:

The Missing Years.

The Jar of Roses.

INT

Tales of Two English Courts.

The Ballad of King Lear and hls
Thrce Daughters.

The parting of Launcelot and

DIBBLE NEEOS FIDDLE WHILE ‘
THE PAPER CHUTE IS B RNING

 

trim the bot flames of it raung fire
rapidly turning the contents of the
paper snutc into a pilc of embers, the
members of Dibble Hall calmly sat on
the floor of their club room and raised
their voices in united discord to the
tune of “Scotland's Burning, Four on
Water, Fire, Fire, Fire."

The only fire they saw was the
brightly burning flamcs of the fire
place logs. The only smokc they
smelt was the mingling of the fumes
of Camels and Edgeworth. The noise
of their singing drowned out all axe
terior sounds and they were totally
unaware that the Grinnell Fire De-
partment was risking life and limb in
vain effort ’to save the Sunday edition
of the Herald and Examiner,

lltst Smoker ill Years

Literally speaking, it was the best
smoker that the building has ever had.
’The fire department had to be convinc-
ed over the phone that the al_arlll was

ircal, but the smell of burning wood
and the numerous watery eyes of the
local combatants convinced them on
their arrival that sometning was hot.

second floor and succeeded in getting
the hall pretty well inundated.
Source vi Fire Unknown

No satisfactory explanation can be
secured as to the cause of the conflu-
gration. one 'Lheory is that it was
caused by a hot Malteaser story that
did,not pass the censors. Another
theory is that it was an editorial for
the Scarlet and Black. The most logi-
cal theory offered is that it was
started by a copy of "Confessions of
Vera, Countess of Cathcart.”

The only act of heroism was Del»
formed by Lloyd Knlltsou who opened
all the windows in the building so the
north wind cnuld blow all the pic-
tures and pennants off the walls.

The Philadelphia Public Ledger der

poet, rugged, with deeply lined lace,
eyes deep set, and a wisp of ll'onvgl‘ay
hair hanging over his forehead." He
talks with an honest man-to-nlan sins
cerity which he has put into the
crashing angular words of his verse."
Whatever else he is or is not, Carl
Sandburg is a fascinating and fearless
painter with words.

LOCAL SYNDICATE

CLEANS UP IN

 

SHORT STOCK MA’RKET OPERATION

The local investor's Syndicate any
bounced, in kccping with Mr. Durant
and other big financial intcrests rep-
resented on the Stock Exchange, a
sotisiactoly period or oucratiou during
the past four months.

Last October the members of Pro-
fessor Strong’s investment class or-

,gtlrlized to sell something they never

had at a price they did not pay for it,
and expected to receive a profit on the
transaction. They suscl‘tbed to twen—
ty- xsbares otPiercevArrow stock at
five dollars a share and with in four
months they have received one dollar
and thirty cents on each five dollars
invested, or interest at twenty-six per
cent.
Sold What They Did Not Have

The investors played the Stock Ex-
change by first selling Short, the
Shares of Pierce Arrow Common; that
is, they sold them when they were not

in their possession. Then something
happened which caused Pierce Arrow
stock to sink from quotations in the
for-tics to quotations in the thirties.

The Syndicate tbcn bought the
shares at a lower level to complete
the transaction which they had open-
ed when they sold short. The differ—
ence between the two price levels rep-
resented the profits made.

hitcmst Exodbimllt

A twanyAsix per cent return for
four month represents a yearly in-
terest of seventy-eight per cent. If
the return were capitalized at the
normal rate of interest, six per cent,
the value of each five dollar share
would be sixty-five collars. If a re-
turn of only fifty per cent is secured
and the profit is relnvtsted it will
take only twenty-five years for an
original sum of $100 to accumulate to
well over a million.
