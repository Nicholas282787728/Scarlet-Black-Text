Spirit Of Addison Again Returns

I h: 0 observed that most readers
do not [eel easy about reading a piece
until they have been let into the
“know" as to thc idcntity of the write
or. ‘This article, with the grace of
the ear ois, is purported to head a ser-
ics oi observations on quibbles and
pranks of Grinnell, college and town,
and the wild in general.

In order to introduce myself so
that in future articles I can speak
with the freedom of intimate convcr-
sntion I give the following identitir
cations. I live in the host building in
the dormitories, this immediately
classes the wr or as a male. An.
other bit of identification which may
prove of interest is that although I ale
ways wcar a tuxedo to formals l have
the detestable habit of sleeping
throuél the hour of breakfast.

The last is probably excuseable be-
cause I have passed the year of hard
knoclis and have occasion to enjoy re.
spite While others close the windows
and-turn on the heat. A little eccen-
tricity which may hit the writer from
the mass of students is that he at.
tends classes when there is nothing
more urgent to do.

Lest the person of the writer is as yet
unknown to the reader this is added
I wear hard-hceled oxiords with heel
plates attached thereto for ecconomy

70h 'yes! Howcvizl‘, I absolutely deny ‘
being guilty 0! sporting a hat. cap or ‘
other means of head coveiing dev‘lsed
to hamper and hinder the mental and
moral growth of man

So much for identification. In ol'r
Ilcr that the reader may not think the
writer ignorant and Ilnversed in the
happenings of the day, and night. let
this be refutation to any argument
which might arise on that score. I '10
solemnly swear that I subscribe to
and read with interest and a fair un-
derstanding the following publicar
tiuns: The Tanager, The Maltcas—
er. The Scarlet and Black and the
Cyclone. The Chicago Tribune is al-i
so perused and a speaking and laugh
ins acquaintance is held with the
principal Charactm‘s of the comics.

In order to show that my ideas are
sound but probably more radical than
the exponents of the Soviet System of
education I do hereby state that 1,
Thomas Quibby, do approve of Sune

day dates and longer hours for quad 7

residents.

Tile reader now knows the most im-
portant things about the writer and
maybe it would not be too egotisticul‘
to think that further articles would at
least be acceptable to the literary diet
of John Sudcnt and his sister, Coed.
