Hyland pointed out that the yelling -.

ot the girls at the games counts more ,.

than they realize and begged them to
make it easier for the men by not dat-
ing with them during the season, for
as he said. "I want those hoys.to he
with me all the way through, and not
handicapped by thinking of the girl
who is waiting for them alter pracr
ticc is over.” ,

After i‘nlml‘essill;v upon the girls how
much their pcp meant, the coach clos-
crl his tall: with a short explanation
or tile l'llles, clearing up a few diffi-
cult points that are hard for the INTI"

The lnaiority of the residents at the
Quadrangle were present to heal‘
Coach Hyland and the sentiment with

which his talk was rcceivctl was cx- .

“Gee. I hate to '
