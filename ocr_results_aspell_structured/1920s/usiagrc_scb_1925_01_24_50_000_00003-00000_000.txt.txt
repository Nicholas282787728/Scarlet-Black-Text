Rotor Ship

A most extraordinary revival of the
sailing ship has just come out of Ger-
many, in Herr Flettnel"s rotor ship.
for which the greatest predictions are
made, since it seems Lo‘llttvc good

Another new source of power. a Sec—
ond recent product of the General
Electric, and thcir Dr. W. L, R. Em-
met, is a “steam" engine which boils
mercurv instcad or water. The heavy
mercury vapor drives a turbine, then
is condensed by 'water, thus boiling
the water which in turn runs a steam
engine and is condensed. The eccir
omy is immense. perhaps to to so per
cent of the fuel saved. over the best
all-steam engines. The first commer—
cial mercury engine has very recently
been set to work.

This dam, though nearly twice as
high as the highest. will not com»
monly be called an invention, yet it
is the same, since strange dams, rotor
ships and all consist essentially oi
thousands of little inventions and
adaptations, judiciously combined to
produce a somewhat new ensemble,‘
cur dam, for which the last selfish ub—
jections have been cleared away. so
that an appropriation to begin it

of that great river. Rising lino feet
above the water level, it will have to
be strong enough to stand ahorizontal
pressure at the base of 300 lbs shov-
ing each square inch. it will cost
in millions but will furnish food
control, irrigation. city water, and
electric power to seven states,

These are only a row of the fascin-
ating inventive dcvelopemnts that the
papers tell us of in the last ten-
months. A great new bridge design

is proposed for San Francisco, to span ‘

Golden Gate. near a mile in one leap.

Junior-S Take Poor

The Junior girls won over the Seine
iors in a very 'poorly played basketball
game Wednesday afternoon by a 11-2
count. The Juniors were ahead during
the entire game but were playing de-
‘ ctdedly oft form, while the Seniors
played their best game oi the season
and were able to hold their opponents
to a 371 score at the close or the first
‘half. The Juniors got away for sev~
leral baskets during the secund half

‘time during the game did they strike
their accustomed stride.
