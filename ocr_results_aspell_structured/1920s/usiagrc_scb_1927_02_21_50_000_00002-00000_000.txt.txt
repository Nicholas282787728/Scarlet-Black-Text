COROLLARY DYE.

One of the best sungesiiohs made so far for the 1927
class gift is a hl-oi ’lllg room for the library. The na-
ture at a browsing room has already been explained in
these columns; many students have seen such l‘ecrear
tional reading rooms as the have been established in thc
libraries oI leading llnivelsltles. The usefulness of such
it donation is recognized.

But once given, what will become or such benelac-
tion? Returning to Grihnell {ﬁe or ten years later, will
members of the present senior class find the nruch touted
browsing room turned into a library assistant's pol-lol-
the prettily hound books that formerly lined the shelves
of the browsing r om dispersed through the stacks; and
the tinted readiug‘lornps made over to de orate the as-
sembly rooms or the Associatluns building?

meets Ihcuity control where bigger and more vital issues
are at étake, where the faculty, as well as the quadrangle

sel'vedly, not (rom it personal stand—

[mm practically the unanimous stand-

point oi the graduates or Grinpcll,

with whom the class or 1927 ill soon
be numbered, the views expt seed in
an editor I oi February 19th concern»

: inc cla gitts. .

However the members or the class
may Iecl about it in thosc closing days
or their collcg lite there is no dues-
troa lint that within a iew years they
will agree that the only permanently
usctul memorial a class can give is a
memorial innd “for the good or Grins
rich," rather thaa,_any gift, no matter
how lavish, which is limited to a spe
citic purpose.

No individual and no group oI intll~
viduals has over yet possessed the
ability to prophesy what a tuture l'n~
stitution will regard as essential or
even desirable. Oil the other
thc made, even the snrall ones, which
have been given to Grinncll ten, torty,
seventy years ago, still carry on the
intent ot the donors and bear their
names in gratetul memory.

The campus is, in a sense, a grave-
yard or obliterated class mementos.
Even such “permanent" memorials as
the grove or trees planted by 1789, and
the cornerstone or the men's gymnar
sium, planted by 1399, will fall into
oblivion long thor-c the Innds or the
College cease to carry on the good
will oi their givers, The class or 1926
.dld a splendid and userul thing in
breaking the precedent at gills to en-
dowment which has been established
In nearly ten years, and in putting its
donation into the pool; but the funds
given by 1919, 1920, 1921. 1922. 1923.
1924 and 1925, and their predecessors
will be even more lmperishablc cou-
trlbutlons to Grlnuell than the most
massive concrete; and it is a maths»
matlccl certainty that children or 1929
will be going through college on into-
ney borrowed train the tund which

 

1925 established.

hantl,‘

 

It is worth noting,
too. that the pool was an unoiticially
authorized necessity, and the class \ ,
lnnteered to help meet this necessity
Other necessities exist which 1927
may go a long ways toward meeting.

The class may, and should, set aside
live or six hundred dollars of its gilt
tor a tablet, sidewalk, ornamental
lamps ol- seats or anything or the kind
it chooses as a visible token or its so-
journ on the campus. By a law at tho
College a portion of every class gilt
must be added to the loan fund tor
the aid of tuture students—children
as has been indicated, ot you who are
about to graduate. But the bulk ot
the gift, which in the lost ten years
has averaged around $10,000. should
constitute thc ‘41927 Class Fund,” tor
the good or the College. The class
may pcrtec‘tly r asonably indicate the
thing which in its judgment the Cole
lcgc riccds most, but its indication
should he 51lech to the needs of the
College as interpreted by the adminis-
trntion.

It has become the custom to inquire
around relatives and bonds whenever
a birthda . is approaching, in order to
as‘certain what gilt will be most web
collie—a book, a‘ necktie, a‘pair ol
gloves, a box or cigars, or a check tor
live dollar "The merits of tllis clisr
tool are oliv us, It is probable that
President Main has some very do“
dcsires for Grilmell that are still no!
realized. A little quiet inquiry witlr
ortt letting the beneficiary know that
a gitt is impending might produce
some very happy consequences. ‘

The class of 1927'has only .i lcw
weeks more on the campus, but i .
members should regard thcrr afflll»
atioll with Gl'inllell lrot as coming to
a close, but rather as changing from
the status at pupils to thltt ot' coiln~
seloIs. Their decision as to a silt to
the College should be not merely one
which satisfies their present senti—
rnent with respect to the: Alma .\l
ter, but one which will be equally sat!
istying when they retrtrrl in ten, twellr‘
ty»[ive or titty years. For you will
be seniors but a littlc while, htrt you‘
