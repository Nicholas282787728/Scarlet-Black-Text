which has been muffed or fumbled

according to Coach L. L, Watt, who
attended a meeting of the Big Six and
Missouri Valley conference ruies‘ in~

City, Sept. 14.

Another change, which will make
differences in several games, is the
moving of the hall for the try for a
point after tounchdown from the
three yard line to the two yard line.
This will give a greater opportunity
for a line plunge over the line.

The first change, that of the dead
hall following a fumble, should les—
