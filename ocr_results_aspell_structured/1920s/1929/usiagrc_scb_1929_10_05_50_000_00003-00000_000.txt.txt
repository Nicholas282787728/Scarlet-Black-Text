Transcontinental Mail
to Stop at New Airport

The Grinnell airport which is to he
dedicated Friday, October 18, is an
intermediate landing for the trans-
continental alr mail route.

There is considerable confusion as
to the exact nature of the new
airport, Postmaster A. M. Burton
who is in charge of the dedication an-
nounced. It is not to he used as a
regular landing field for mail planes
at present although it will probably
serve that purpose in the future.
The nearest regular landing fields
are Iowa city for mails going both
east and west, and Des Moines for
only east hound mail.

There is a passenger plane at the
field now. Commercial planes are
expected to use it in the future.

New Backs Help
Drake Grid Hopes

Des Molnes, iowa, Oct, 5.~Al—
through the Drake university scor-
ing attack was expected to be built
around Dick Nesbitt, Lynn King and
“Charles Van Koten. the showing of
new luminaries during the opening
game with Simpson augurs well for
Drake in the Grinnell contest here
Oct. 26.

The husky, Everett Fags, who saw
some service last year, ripped the
Simpson line for several nice gains,
The Keota plunger is exceptional-
ly strong and several times he ad—
vanced the hall four or five yards
with two orthree Methodists hanging
on.

A sldestepping genius, Billy Good-
win, showed that he was extremely
capable of handling the quartedback
position. Goodwin’s ability to ﬁnd
the open spots-in the line and keep
out of the hands of tacklers makes
him a slippery customer to deal with.
Besides his running ability Goodwin
is a splendid punter. A last minute
injury to Neshitt's side just before
the Simpson game, put Goodwin in
the role of a punter when he substi-
tuted for Lynn King.

Using his speed to excellent ad-
vantage, Vane Snorf, star dosh man,
showed that be is also a reliable
ground~gainen

Another back who hit the line
hard for some good yardage was
Max Everett, brother of the famous
Chuck. ,

With such a bevy of ball toters,
Coach Ossie Solem eliminates many
worries in this line if his boys escape
injury.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Payne Says MacDonald’s Trip Rivals
Flight of Lindbergh Across Ocean

BY THEODORE GLEYSTEEN.

“Prime Minister MacDonald's trip
to the United States may turn out
to be as important as Lindbergh's
flight across the Atlantic," stated
Prof. Charles E. Payne of the history
department in an interview this
Week.

“When Ramsay McDonald was
prime minister in England in
1924 be put into the government and
peoples of Europe a new spirit of
frankness, cooperation and realism,
that was hitherto unknown, and it
appears that he is endeavoring to re-
peat this in AnglorAmericEn relax
tions. This event will he the first
time in the history of these two na-
tions that n prime minister and pres-
ident have met face to face,” con-
tinued Mr. Payne.

They undoubtedly Will
cuss many important issues,
including the prospective tariff
which both England and Canada.
have protested; the attitude they
should take in regards to extraterri-
toriality in China: and they will un-
questionably consider a new arbitra-
tion’ treaty.

"The old treaty between Eng-
land and the United States With
regard to arbitration expired in 1927.
Another one of the subjects which
was to be brought up will be the im-
portant question of naval reduction.
This is a silbject on which they
should be able to agree, at least for
the time being. But it will be some
years yet before the permanent ques-
tion of ‘freodom of the seas' will he
settled for once and all. Mr. Hoover
has for local reasons expressed his
desire to postpone this question."

Professor Payne pointed out that
it was significant that MacDonald
is bringing with him no naval ex-
perts on this trip to the United
States and indicated that it was the
naval experts who caused the failure
of the Geneva Conference two years
ago.

Mr. William B. shearer represent-
ing a group of ship builders was al-
so largely responsible for the dis-
Couraglng results that were obtained
at this conference. Shearer is now
up before Congress and some amaz-
ing revelations of his procedure have
been brought to light. Events like
this make the public more aware of
the forces that are causing this
strained national feeling. It is very
likely that the American people will

Tariff ll. Barrier

Regarding the statement recently
issued by M. Briand, the prime rnin»
ister of France. as to a possible re-
moval of economic barriers in Europe,
this is not purely the work of one's
imagination but it is something that
is at least in part going to come
about within the next few years, ob-
pean countries," he said, “are begin—
pean countries, he said, arc begin-
ning to realize that they are only
holding themselves back by the 27
sets of tariff walls that they now
have That the economic situation
as it is today, is hindering each one
of the European countries is realized
by all political and financial circles.
if these tariffs are eliminated in the
future, European manufacturers will
have a market of three hundred and
twenty million customers as comv
pared with the one hundred and
twenty million American consumers
open to American manufactures.
With this market and Europe's wonr
derful system of transport, their
skillful workmen and their natural
resources they should rapidly get
back on their feet, Not only this but
they should become more prosperous
in all respects. Besides this, the
breaking down of these tariff wells
will remove many of the petty dif-
ferences and hates of these little
countries in Europe."

Marquette Tilt
Next Saturday

coaching staff states that according
to previous records, Grinnell has a
slight edge over their rivals. but this
is counteracted by the fact that the
game is to he played on the home
ﬁeld of the Hilltop eleven. “At any
rate." says Coach Truesdale. “it will
be c nip and tuck game.”

Grinnell football fans were watch-
ing the outcome of the Marquette»
Lawrence football game this after-
noon at Milwaukee with interest, as
the showing of the 1929 edition of
the Golden Avalanche will give some
indication of what sort of a battle
Grinnell may expect next Saturday.

Marquette's 1929 strength is un-
tried in actual combat, but reports
from the Milwaukee institution in-
dicate the usual hard-lighting team
that Coach Frank J. Murray turns
out annually. Murray has a vast as-
sortment of backfield material this
fall, while Line Coach John L. Tay-
lore, last year assistant to Doc Wilce
at Chjo state, is reported to be de
veloping a good forward wall.

Following Drake's example in the
installation of a system of floodlights
for night games, Marquette is equip-
ping its gridiron with sixteen projec-
tors, eacb with a 3000 watt bulb,
erected on sixty foot poles. The
ﬁrst night game will be the hcme~
coming conflict with Grinnell’s op-
ponent of today—lows State college.
