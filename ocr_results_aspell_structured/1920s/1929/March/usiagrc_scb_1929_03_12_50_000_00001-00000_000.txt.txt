Drake Finishes First, Washington
Captures Second In Annual
Meet At st. Louis.

Tile Gi'iniiell entries in the Missouri
Valley conference swimming meet
covered themselves with glory,
amassing a total of fifteen points to
take third in the meet. Although
the meet was taken by Drake 47
points and Washington was second
with 43 points, the Grinnell entries
did better in their respective events
than they had done before this sei-
son.

In the 20d yard relay the Pioneers
took second place when Washington
was disqualified. The pioneer team
was composed of Dewey, c, De-
ioug, Gillespie, and Bacon.

Dewey Qualifies

In the 50ryard [ree style, Dewey,
the pioneer captain, qualified taking
second in his heat and then was on-
ly barely rinsed out by a few inches
from placing in the finals. In this
event the valley record was broken
and Dewey probably broke the old
record.

In the «Howard free style, Gillespie
took second place. swimming a very
nice race to push Skinner of Wash-
ington who was conceded the event.
Gillespie also took fourth in the
220-yard free style,

In the fancy diving. “Chuck" De»
Long did the best diving he has done
all year, but only took fourth place
because the diving Was exceptional.
Nailert of Washington took first and
Strong of Drake was second.

Medley Does Well

In the medley relay the Pioneer
team swam a line race beating out
the Oklahoma Aggies team by about
half a length. DeLoug took a slight
lead on Howells of Oklahoma Aggies,
and then Bacon increased his load
slightly, In the free style part of the
relay, Dewey increased the lead to
half a length in his first length and
held it there,

considering the fact that in this
meet, six existing records Were brok~
en. the Pioneers acquitted themselves
nobly.

Construction olf Skyscraper Like
Development of Organism
Declares Rand.

“If we saw a modern skyscraper
rise from the building materialsul ll»
out the aid of human hands we would
be astonished, vc that plciure is, in
a way, comparable to tlle develops
lncnt or an Organism," That state-
ment was made by Dr. H. ‘V. Rand
in introducing his lecture in long
chapel Wednesday morning on “The
Development of Organic Form."

He continued to explain that there
is also a striking contrast ileiiveeu
the construction of a building and
tlle development of Organic form.

Describes I-lxprrimcuis

In discussing the various theories
of organic development, Dr. Rand
described the experimental work of
Malpiglii, .Wplff, vcn Buir, Pfiuger,
und Born. Mnlpighl was a seven-
teenth century Italian scientist who
upheld the I’m-formation idea. \Volff
and von Eair carried on experiments
during the eighteenth century which
give precedence to the theory of
Apigenesis.

Pflllger declared in 1883 that
gravity is the determining factor in
cell division, rind since that (late
zoologists have been studying the re-
lation of external forces to organic
velopment of organic form. His subs
that disproved Piluger's
declaration, but the interest of scien-
t’. s in external forces has not been
diminished.

Co-eds Become Old Clothes Peddlers
To Aid In Theta Sigma Rummage Sale

“Anv rags: old iron! old .lioc
any rubbish to give awnyl“, such has
been the cry uging through the
Quadrangle corridors for the past
week, while posters at various con—
spicuous places proclaim the fact
that new spring wardrobes may be
procured at astoundingly low prices
all day Saturday at 329 Broad street,
Theta Sigma Phi is sponsoring a
rummage sale, to which all Grinnoll
men, women, and children are re
spectiully and hopefully invited,
Many are the enticing liar-gains to
he put before the public, and every
article offered for sale guaranteed by
Miss Aileen Cohcn, chairman of the
committee, as perfectly legitimate
rummage. Here Miss Grinnell Col-
lege may {ind a pair of white gloves,
with only a very slight coffee stain
on the left one, that will do very
nicely for the Spring formal, or here
Mr. Collegiate may pick up, to
match his new iolt hat, a vividly—
spottcd ncclrtio that cousin Gertie
gave Mr. Jones last Christmas, and
that Mrs. Juries sneaked out oi his
drawer and gave to the Theta Sig
girl when Mr. Jones Wasn‘t looking.
There is a chance that even Mr.
Profcssor's wife could find an old

 

\civct bonnet that, would do to take
apart and make for Betty's
Easter hat, while Mr. Professor llime

over

self might spot and rescue the last
half of a volume of Pluto that had
been tossed around unclaimed ill the
dormitories for some time

Values in jewelry have not been
fixed certainly, as word has not yet
been received from Paris as to wcth-
er blush pink or pumpkin orange
will be worn this spring. Books and
paper will sell at almost zero cost.
while a big boom is expected in autos
mobile robes. Rubber-soled shoes
have been gathered in by a special
committee and will be kept in secret
stock for prospective lire-escape
climbers Accessories for any and
every occasion have been ransacked
from Grinnell homes.

Such a terrific sale has been pre
dicted that Grinnell merchants are
seriously contemplating closingshop
Saturday. As the stock is limited. it
has been advised by these juurnal-
istic rummagcrs that all purchasers
with serious intent come early and
avoid the rush, for he who comes
first to a rummage sale is welcomed
with wideropened arms.

Tseng‘ 'Iﬁ‘aces China’s Story From
1840 On To Present Time;
New Members Added,

Raymond Tseng talked on "The
Nationalist Government of China" lie-
iore the Cosmopolitan club Monday
evening. He traced the story of
'himt from Idlo when her calm was
first broken by foreigners up to the
present eightenlonthrold nationalist
government.

In a short business meeting. Fran-
ces Schoonoyer was elected to mem-
bership. Lewis Troycr is also a new
member.

Mr. Tscng began his talk by men-
tioning the Opium war of 18-12, when
Great Britain forced China to open
her ports, More and more foreigners
came, to China. bringing trouble.
They forced unequal treaties upon
her, and took all her seaports for
themselves, Then Japan fought and
defeated China in 1896.

“The people began to want a new
government." Mr. Tseng said. "The
old government was weak and ig-
lloriint. It didn’t know anything
about the world,”

Boxer Rebelliiili‘

The empress in 1900 tried to close
China to foreigners. thinking that
then all would be happy and peace
iut again. But in the Boxer Rebel-
lion, eight nations combined to de-
ieat China. Again the people hoped
for a new government.

Sun YatrSel-i, a very poor Canton
boy, became the leader of the new
revolutionary movement, "After
Sun's death we worship him in
Chinr Mr. Tseng said. “All schools
and offices everywhere under the
Chinese flog have a service ior him
on Monday morning. and make three
bows to his Statue. He gave the idea
of democracy, or an organized nu-
ticnulist government, to China."

A million dollar reward for Sui
head was offered by the emperor.
Sun had to change his name and
work in secret. In 1911 he sent his
followers all over China to start the
revolution, and 1912 he succeeded
without much fighting,

(‘ivil Wiir

Unfortunately, Dr. Sun gave the
presidency to General Yuan, an old
fashioned imperialist. Yuan tried to
make himself emperor; but in liild
he died, and ”bequeathed to China a
crop of litlc viia'us as selfish as him—
self." Then came c war for ten
years, Yunn's generals liccamc inde-
pendent, got control of var-ions prov-
inces, and drained their Wealth.

Sun tried another revolution, but
there were too many generals fight
ing against each other. Finally there
was only one war-lord loft, Chane

Upheld Negative of Resolution 01:
Modem Jury System In No
Decision Argument.

BOTH CASES ABLY STATED

Brodine, Danforth and Hawk Are
Members of Local Squad
Facing Minnesotans.

A Grinnell negative team consisting
0: Donald Brodinc, Jothathan Dan-
forth and Francis Hawk, met the
Carleton affirmative team made up
of Hemdn B. Johnson, Kenneth W.
Rowe, and Lloyd M. McBride in the
auditorium of A. R. H. Tuesday night
on the question Resolved: that the
present jury system should lie abol-
ished, It was a no decision argu-
ment ill keeping with the present
tendency in inter-collegiate debate
here in the middle west.

The main arguments of the affirm-
ative for the question were that
modern society had become so com-
plex that many of the questions
brought for juries to decide were
far beyond the scope of their ex-
perience, that the jury is a. static in-
stitution in a dynamic society and so
should be abolished. In other conn<
tries there is a tendency toward
delegation of the power and author-
ity to expert judges. Further, in
actual practice the jury is led by
one or two leaders in making its
decisions instead of actually fun-
ctioning as twelve lllen of equal abil-
ity and power for decision. Then
the recently developed practice of
lawyers of making strong enlotlonal
appeals to the juries stands as an
obstacle in securing justice. In some
states of the United States where the
people have the right to waive trial
by jury in favor of expert judgement.
over ninety per cent of the cases
have been tried by experts rather
than by juries. The affirmative al-
so proposed a plan which they
thought Would function more ef-
llciently than the present jury sys
tem. The plan suggested was to
have a group of three expert judges
who would have the privilege of call-
ing in expert: witnesses thus making
their judgment more infallible.

Jury Temporary

A further objection to the jury
system made by the affirmative was
that ﬁle jury Was only 2 temporary
organization and as such was nut
very responsible,

The negative on the other hand
countered these objections with the
arguments that many of the troubles
now attributed to the jury system
were in reality dlle to causes outside
the actual system In support of this
argument the negative cited exam-
ples of hindering technicalities of
the law and judges who fettered
the in with antiquated methods of
procedure, Tileinegutive further be-

THREE WINS OVER
FOUR IN BASEBALL

Dibble Shuts Out Smith Ry Score of
13 to 0 Tuesday Afternoon.

In an indoor baseball game Mon-
day niternoon, Kelly stables set a
high scoring record for this season
by defeating the Building from
team 21 to 7. The game was a run-
away with the Stable Boys scoring
’ rims in each of the first two
innings and scoring some runs in
every inning thereafter. The game
was a barrage of base hits with
Kelly stables collecting eighteen
bingles. The star of the game was
Ruff of Three who made four hits
in five times up, lilcCreai-y also col-
iected a like number and Woody was
credited with three out of five. Richey
played best for Four.

Tuesday afternoon. Dibble shut out
Smith by the score of 13 to o in a
game which was marked by the ex-
treme loose playing of the South-
enders. Dibble had two strong in-
nings in which they scored six runs
each, but in the other innings, the
Smith buys functioned somewhat.
Wilhelm and Delohg played the best
game for Dibble, Belong collecting
three hits in as many times at bat
as well as a sacrifice hit. Nielsen was
the only bright light of the losers.
