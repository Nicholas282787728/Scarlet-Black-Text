Ruff Makes First Score As Cag-
ers Win from Midwest Champs
In Fast Battle,

GRINNELL NEVER BEADED

Local Team Works Smoothly to
Hold Early Lead, Score 20 to
13 at Intermission.

The Gl-innell Pioneers caliie into
their own Monti . night by trouncing
Coe. willcli was last yer s champion
oi the Midwest contercnce so to 20.

The game started tlut M It iii'ei’lkr
neck pace wltll both teams taking the
ball up and down the iloor at it last
clip. Grinnell scored that on Rllfi's
basket iroin the corner :liter taking
a pass irom Fall. From this time on,
Coe was never in the lead, although
they tied the score at Grail otter
about live minutes or pla . The
score was close lintil the closing lniu—
lites oi the ball, when Grinnell took
a determined spurt and had placed
the score at 20 to 13 in tavor oi the
Pioneers at intermission,

The second halt oi the game was
merely marked by Grinnen keeping
ahead by close guarding and an ce-
caslonal march up the lioor to score
a basket, or to heaving long shots
iroin near the middle oi the Iloor. In
neither oi these tactics were they
successful, as is shown by the tact
that they made only two iield goals
during the second hair.

Ingram, illit'l‘ star

Ingram and Ruii were outstanding
ior the Pioneers. These two scored
the hold goals apiece. and .were
working well together at all times,
Their specialty was taking a pass
iroin one oi the other men on the
team and tossing a sleeper iroin “in
der the basket, The guarding oi the
Pioneers was very good, Macy and
Fall hreaking up nearly all oi the
plays that Coe attempted, Douglas
periormed well ll liile in the game.
