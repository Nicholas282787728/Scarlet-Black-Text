Own Aerial Game as Answer

to Pioneer Threat.

Harold Rose, captain of the
Pioneer eleven, and his cohorts
iett their native haunts Thursday
night, embarking for Milwaukee,
WiS., where today they tangled with
the Marquette gridmen in a football
classic of no mean proportions.

This same Rose, according to his
mentor, Fuzz (Woeful) Watt, was
to start the contest at fullback with
Russell Ruff and Ed Lietke at halves,
while Ernie Mclntire was in his usu-
al monkey-suit and playing quarter-
back.

Heidrldge at Center.

Line Coach Duke believed Elite
and Briggs the logical choice at the
ends, Walker and Humphrey at tack-
ies, Bradford and Parish at guards
and _l-Ieldridge at center. Oscar
Christofterscn, the sturdy thnne
from the Quaker oats regions, ,did
not start because of some injuries
which he suffered at the hands of
the enthusiastic Iowa State pig-skin
toters. Hank Thomas also did not
start the contest for the some rea-
son.

Just as Ruff started the Golden
Avalanche on a downward slide in
1928, and then stepped out of the
way, so was he expected. to bring
victory this‘year. With the heaviest
line combination available on the
ﬁeld, the mentors hoped to hold out
opposing‘forwards long enough to
enable the redoubtable Ruff to shoot
a pass or two in the general direction
of eligible men.

The glowing reports to the effect
that Grinnell’s aerial game this year
is fully as good as last year when
it defeated Marquette, have made the
Hiutoppeis determined to use the

ssing game as a boomerang today
against the Pioneers, if reports from
Milwaukee were true. Marquette
has been drilling on the aerial game
all week.

Marquette Doped to WilL

The pioneers were playing against
a double handicap today being on
hostile territory and before a strange
throng, while Coach Frank J. Murray
of Marquette had endeavored to give
his men some conndence with new
two<toned jersies with a gdld body
and 3 Variation in the sleeves.

After the Grinneii showing at
Ames, Marquette has been doped by
the experts to take the contest by
a good margin. It was Knute
Rockne, however, who once said,
“but Grlunell has tradition," The
men will battle for victory to the
last. '

Crook Sculpture Unexplained.

Taft said, but the characteristics of
the country and the people partially
explain it. Greece is a comparative-
ly small country with along sea
coast. Each city was surrounded
with its wall and built in a valley: as
a result every valley had its own
civilization and great independence
of spirit which was shown in their
sculpture.

Their religion, choral system,

ﬂuenced the Greek art. Contests

Johnson Talks

on Prohibition

‘America Making Success
of Recent Amendment,’
Says Speaker.

“If America continues to make a
success of prohibition, as it is doing
at present. in time there will not be
one civilized nation in the world that
can hope to compete with it in com-
mercial and economic relations, un-
less they, too, adopt prohibition,"
declared William E. “Pussyfoot”
Johnson in delivering an address in
the auditorium of the Methodist
church last night.

"But the most important thing
right now," said Mr. Johnson, "is to
fight oft the strong opposition that
prohibition faces right here in our
own country. It will takeevery man,
womanvand child»thht can be enroll»
ed in order to do it."

"Pussyioot" has recently returned
from a tour of European countries,
and in his lecture last night, which
was’sponsored by the National Anti-
Saloon league, be informed his audi-
ence, by campurisohl with provinces
of the old country, what would hap-
pen to the United States Should Lhe
eighteenth amendment be repealed.

Major E. B. Ebbert, California
lawyer, preceded the address of Mr.
Johnson with a discussion of the ac-
tivities of the anti—prohibition party.

“My Turkish God-Daughter Made 50 -’
Turks Sign Pledge,” Says “Pussyfoot”

_ BY JANE LEWIS.

"And these are my three Turkish
god-children,” said William E. (Pus-
Syfoot) Johnson, extracting three
Small Snapshots from his bill fold.
“The one on top is just a youngster,
but the other two are almost through
college, and I’m looking out for their
education. They both call be daddy,"
he added proudly.

The intrepid prohibition lecturer

has evidently made converts of his .

“children" in Turkey. for he con-
tinued with their story by saying
that the young woman, his gori-
dcughter, once made so successful a
Visit in a, little Turkish village, tht
ilfty topers signed for her a pledge of
abstinence.

”Later-{continued Mr. Johnson, “I
received a letter written in horrible
English. It was signed by fifty
Turks whose names were absolutely
unpronounceable. They were thank-
ing me for my influence toward pro-
hibitiou."

“My older god-son is interested in
athletics as well as prohibition,n said
Mr. Johnson. “He keeps me busy
buying these spiked shoes. He 314
ways runs away with half the prizes

 

in a track meet."

In answer to a question Concern»
ing the prohibition movement among
college students of European and
Oriental nations, Mr. Johnson replied
that there were twenty thousand col-
lege men in Jugoslsvis behind the
movement, and a large organization
of interest in Czechoslovakio. From
these groups come leaders in the
movement.

"As to India,” said Mr. Johnson,
“it's a serious problem. The govern-
ment Won’t stand for much talk on
prohibition, I met three or four
young men in India. who had been
jailed for sedition. We had quite a
pow-wow. They fed me rice and we
talked over the situation. They
seemed pretty blue until I told them
that I had been in jail once myself."

In commenting on the value of
newspaper publicity for prohibition,
the lecturer observed that vicious
papers did the movement not so
much harm as a good news sheet
like the New York Times.

"Since the Times is conservative."
said Mr. Johnson, uit carries more
weight and hurts our cause by
being so very decent."
