Last Year’s Squad Forms
Nucleus for Likely

Looking Group.

OpeningFame Soon

Pioneers to Face Strong Marquette
Squad on Home Floor on

Saturday. Dec. 14.

After wooing Dome Victory With
rather more than fair success on the
gridiron. Grinnell athletes will try
their hand at gaining her favor

throughout, the winter months on the .

basketball floor. Preparatory work
for greeting that exceedingly popu-
lar maiden started this week
with the reporting of gridmen for
basketball practice.

Just how the team will stack to-
gether is still a mystery—and Coach
Truesdale seems to have no key to
its solution yet. Carleton Humph-
rey. veteran center, will very likely
be back at his old post. The only
man on the squad to compete with
him in the way of size is Clarence
Cooper. a comparatively inexperir
enced sophomore. who may show
some ability before the end of the
season. Ben Douglas. veteran guard
is scheduled for one guard and Caps
tain Wilhelm will very likely be at
the other guard position.

Many Forward Candidates

The forwards are all in a muddle.
Minier and Ruff. both lettermen. are
back with the outfit but may be used
only part of the time. with new men
working into the game whenever pos-
sible. Bob Dclong, hot-shot of the
192849 quintet. is back on the squad
and shooting with a dead eye again
He may get a regular berth. Bob is
not a veteran but has seen experience
in many games. Schmaedecke and
Scott, a pair of last season's squad
members are up to their usual form
and are both good candidates.

Christoffersen. Murphy and Ed-
man are all likely sophomores who
must be considered and McCreary
and Murray. two of the shining lights
of last year's frosh outfit are on the
squad. Murray's flashy passing.
which was the bulwark of the fresh-
man strength last season, will une
doubtedly make a strong bid for hon—
ors with the first five and may de-
velop into one of the chief offensive
cogs of the aggregation,

Only a week remains before the
opening game against Marquette.
who boasts a strong team this sea-
son. The Milwaukee school team
divided two close contest with Grin-
nell last season and has virtually the
same lineup this year with the ex~
ception of Captain Gebcrt .who was
lost by graduation.
