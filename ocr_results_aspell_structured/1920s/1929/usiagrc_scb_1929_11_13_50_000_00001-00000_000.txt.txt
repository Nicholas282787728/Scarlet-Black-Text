Disarmament Is

Theme of Y. W.
Meeting Monday

As a part of the observance of
Armistice Day, the Y. W. C. A. held
a discussion on disarmament among
the ﬁve great Powers Monday eve-
ning after dinner in the quadrangle
drawing room.

Marcia Cabalan introduced the
speakers, who' gave short talks.
Those who presented arguments for
armaments and the country which
they discussed are as follows: Mal"-
garct Wood on France, Frances
Peck. Italy; Dorothy Nelson. Japan;
Helcn Kingery, England; and Ruth
Horiue the United States.

The negative side, or disarmament
was upheld by: Margaret Wright on
France. Winifred Webster, Italy;
Roberta Vance. Japan; Mary Lark,
England; and Pauline Bleakney the
United States.

In the case for arms it was shown
that armament docs not necessarily
mean war but that it is needed for
protection and for keeping an econ-
omic independence. On the other
hand, the negative side declared that
armament does not make for secur-
ity but tends toward war which is a
destroying influence while dis-
annament would make for peace.

The meeting was in charge of the
committees of Peace and World Fel-
lowship of the Y. W. C, A.

Many Men Are
at Stag Dinner

Main, Beatty and Phillips
'Talk on ‘Social Man’ ~

Last Saturday.

About two hundred students and
twenty faculty members attended the
stag dinner Saturday night sponsor-e
ed by the men's council of house
chairmen, according to Davis Greene,
who was in charge of arrangements.
The event may be made an annual
affair.

The purpose of the dinner was the
centering of attention on the social
side of the students life. Profes‘
sors who were present were seated
at student tables for sociability; af-
ter dinner, programs were performed
by representatives of each cottage
of the quadrangle, and all the toasts
took the social man, in some one of
his aspects. for their themes. Don
Goodman, chairman of Four, was
toastmaster, and he introduced Pres-
ident Main, Richard Phillips and
Dean Beatty, in order.

President Main, in the ﬁrst toast.
asked that our greetings, our good
mornings and good ’evenings, be so
cordial as to' distinguish a Grinnell
man the world over, while Phillips
stressed the value of Grinnell social
life as it is.

Girls Give Program

Dean Shelton Beatty, in the ﬁnal
toast, emphasized the importance of
manners. A simple courtesy or an
elementary etiquette, he told his
hearers, can make a man at home in
all places and all ages; and he sug<
gested that college men take more
care in this regard than they are her
customed to.

Between the end of the dinner and
the toasts the cottage programs ap—
peared. From Mears Ethel Foltz and
Esther Griffith sang three popular
songs in duet, accompanying them-
selves on the ukelele

The Cottage Two program was a
soprano solo by Winifred Kelch, ace
companied by Blanche Hulscbus.
Mary B. James cottage supplied a
violin solo by Ruth Goodenow, with
the same accompanist.

Cottages Four and Five produced
respectively a piano solo by Mar
garst Jean Howell, and a song and
dance number by Evelyn Edenburn.
The ﬁnal item on the program was
two solos by Arline Urban,

Music before and during the din»
nor was furnished by Chuck Lau-
strup, Lester Scott, Chuck Woody,
and Harry rtinefort.

‘Organization of World Against War
Is Supreme Problem,’ Says Gannaway

“For two nations at war to select
their choicest football teams to de-
cide the issues at stake by a gridiron
battle would be much less futile than
the system of settling disputes ,on
the battlefielr," declared Prof. J, W.
Gannaway in an Armistice day talk
at chapel Monday on “The World's
Supreme Problem.” "And,” he adde
ed, “it would be much more pleasure
to witness."

“The supreme problem before mans
kind today, overshadowing every-
thing else, is the problem of the
elimination of war and of the organs
ization of the world for peace,” the
speaker said, as he contrasted this
problem with the petty problems of
national and local politics which in
their comparative insignificance,
claim a disproportionate share of our
time. ,

Beginning with a tribute to those
who fought in the World war, Mr.
Cannaway pointed out that the gen-
eration now coming to college knows
little of the horrors and tragedy of
the war from personal experience,
and that there is danger lest we for-
get the real awfulness of the recent
conflict.

War Taught Three Lessons
“Great lessons were learned from
the Great war." said Mr. Gannaway,
naming three outstanding ones.
“First, the war showed the ineffelzs
tiveness of defensive alliances and of
balances of power as a means of pre-
serving peace, The world's experl-
ences, culminating in the World war,
proved that they were wholly in»
adequate, we need something more

than such alliances and balances of
power. Second, the war showed up
the impotency and failure of huge
armaments as an instrumentality for
promoting peace; inevitably thc

armaments have lead to aggression

and war. Third, the last conflict rc-
vcaled the supreme futility of war it~
sclf as a means of settling internar
tional difficulties. Each nation
might just as well select its best
prizcngbter to light out its cause in
the ring.”
Pence rs. lrology Developing

The extraordinary dcvelopment of
a psychology favoring peace in the
past, culminating in the Kellogg
Peace pact was commented up-
on favorably by- the speaker.
“Look back to the London Naval con»
ference of 1903," he said, "and con-
trast the psychology of militarism
prevalent there with the atmosphere
of friendliness surrounding the forth-
coming naval confcrence at Lopdon
in January. Why,.in 1908. the~‘ccn~
ferencc was for the sole purpose of
clarifying the rules of naval warfare
on the sea. War was taken for
granted. In the conference soon to
be held, the purpose is to ﬁnd a way
of not only limiting but reducing
naval armament,

Civilization Menaccd by War

"The very fate of our civilization
depends on succeeding in this thing,"
concluded Mr. Cannoway. "Our
civilization could not stand another
great world struggle,”

Mr. Cannaway introduced his re-
marks by outlining the great issues

Merrill Debate

Is Tomorrow

‘ltalian Dictatorship' to Be
, K
Argued by Buildings

Four and Five.

Due to the conflict with the last Taft
lecture which is to be given tonight.
the semi-final Merrill debate has
been postponed to tomorrow evening
at eight o’clock in the club room of
Building Four. The subject of the

the first round, “Resolved that Ital-
ian dictatorship is justifiable."

The affirmative argument will be
presented by Lee Henson and Lee
Alexander of Building Four. Al
Johnson and Arthur dc Persia of
Building Five will uphold the nega-
tlve.

ious in the first round drew a bye to
the finals. The members of Three's

Chest Gets $1080
Last Report Shows

A final check—up of the Pioneer
chest drive in the Quadrangle after
the close of the campaign last week
revealed that the college girls had
pledged about $630. This with the
$450 raised in thc dorms and among
town men brings the total up to
$1080. about half of the two thous-
and dollars that was hoped for from
the quad, dorms, and faculty.

The drive on the whole was consid-
ered succcssful. The pledges of the
faculty will raise the amount to
within reach of the goal,

The money will be divided among
the Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A,, and
Grinneileinecmna. The money which
is used by the two associations will
provide for redecoration of the asso-
ciations rooms, the meetings of the
organizations, and their social func-
tions, ,

Blanche Hulsebus and Elizabeth
Cook in the Quadrangle, Lewis Trays
er and Walter Secor in the dorms,
and Nelson w. Wehrhan on the fac~
ulty had charge of the canvassing.
Under their direction, two or three
members of each dorm conducted the
campaign.

Thomas Set to Play

Will Be at Quarter, with McIntira
at Half ; Grinnell Given Edge
in Final Home Game.

Despite the fact that Bichey and
Klinefelter Will both be out of the
game with injuries, Coach Fuzz Watt
will put a powerful lineup on the
gridiron against Carleton here Satur-
day afternoon if the string of men he
has been using in practice this week
is any indication. McIntire will be
shifted to Richey's halfback post, a
position which he played against
Drake, while Thomas, after a three
week rest, will handle the quarter—
back position.

Coach Watt has not been driving
his men hard this week, apparently
letting them ride into the Carleton
contest easily with a final set of hard
practice sessions before he closes the
season against Creighton Thanksgiv—
ing day. A signal drill and some
work at getting down under punts,
comprised the work Monday and a
cold rain kept the team inside Toes-

tant past, Ruff and McIntire at

er Christoffersen or Heldridge will
start at center with Parish and

big margin. They staged a real bat-
tle against Coe last Saturday. how~
ever, and may be able to show the
