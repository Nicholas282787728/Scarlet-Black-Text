QUALITY 0R QI. 'TiTrz
Gl‘iimell has all enviable record or educational lcall-
cl'sllip ill the middle “est, one of “hicll she may feel
justly proud. Iier pioneering and pragessire spirit in
approaching uncertain and . ng educational problems
has commanded natio Vitle approval. This distinction
is one tradition that G inuell may well choose to cherish
and maintain unchallenged.
At present her leader iii! in matters of student gov-
ernnlcnt, social, and athletic policy does exemplify this
. traditional 5 irit, President Main remains an arduous
advocate of certain exceptional and, \\'E1 believe, admir-
able concepts of the meaning of college community life.
It is not these "lot We Wish to question. We do
tee], however, that cognizance should be taken of
what \_\'e heliel'e to be marked tendencies,in matters
of curl Illllln. and allied policies. Our remal' s
are not designed to he destructive or unduly cri cal, but
rather are to be considered as stimulating impressions.

re wc sicriiicing qualit for quantity, both as lo
type of students admitted to this institution, and as to
type ol' u olli'.’ Grinuoll prides he self on being ouc oi
the hotter lihcral arts college, whose reason ior ex .t-
once is to pros rc in the lace oi an onrrishiiig mass type
of education the individualistic atmosphere ucc sary for
ical derclopment. This means that Grinucil should ad-
mir oiil, those students who are purpnsctnl, thosc uhosc
rccord indicates that they are lcss couccrncd ahout the
deal cc tllall ahout their own cultural condition, But is
such a policy operative? It seems to us not only that
very little selection is exercised, hut that classroom work
in the main is adjusted to the capacity oi the mediocre
or nrcrngc student. The result seems to he that the hot-
tcr students iind tiicmselvo. groping "stale" at their
work President ai-delolte or sirai-thuiore College has
npily said that “in education in things of the mind and
of the spirit, quality is everything. and we find ourselves
in danger of socr g qllalih' to quantity

Specifically. does Grillnell provide suificicpi iucellr
tires for scholarship? it can no longer h urged that a
s stem of grades promotes high quality worli-f We ven-
ture the statement thut a bright strident can go through
cripnell. with an almost perfect "A" record, and yet
emerge in the same intellectually unins ircd state in
uliich hc hegau h ~ college coil e. :\il extension of tlic

riually. arc we obtaining student cuuiidence and co.
operation on matters of educational policy? We under—
stand lllal curriculum reorganization has lleen “in the
Ail” tor a car or two. Has strident opinion on the hroe
posed modiﬁcations liccn . cmatically sought? True.
ccrtaui proio ors hai-c made it a point to inquire or
their classe on a row points, hut this is haphazard and
iiusatisiaciory. Perhaps students-arc not qualified to
ndi -c on matters of curriculum; they posSlhl) do not
know what is hest for them. h vcrthelcss, they should
he able to give them ies a more or less valuahle prog-
matic test, which should he or as once in considering
changes. Why not have a student adiisory heard to uorlc
with the iacrilry committee. consisting oi those students
who are interested, and perhaps contemplate educational
u orlt, themselves?

The answer to these various queries will prohahlv he
that Griiiuell must maintain a strident body or the ma.
mum puniher and cannot afloril too much selection. We
would answer w h the words or President Aydelott
“The ' nltcrnat e is not to reduce the numhcr
or those who are admitted; it is rather to provide tor
each strident a discipline suited to his ahilities, which
means that for the host we must provide a training and
a discipline many: times more difticuit and more thor—
ough than for the a'.'e|age." “'0 feel that Grinnell might
ucll view with alarm the danger signs which indicate
that she is promoting a type or mediocrity among her
strident , and that she is sacrificing hcr educational
leadership.
