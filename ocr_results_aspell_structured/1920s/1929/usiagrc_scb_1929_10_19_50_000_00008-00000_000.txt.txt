Games of Past
at Homecoming

are Recalled

With a Close battle anticipated to-
day between Grinnell and Washing-
ton, it is interesting to look back in
the football archives and see just
what Grinnell has done to her oppon-
ents in past homecoming games.

It was not until 1907 that Grin<
nell had 9. special game set aside for
homecoming. Since that time there
have been twenty games played on
homecoming occasions, one each year
with the exceptions of 1918-19: Out
of these twenty games Grinnell has
won ten and tied one.

Grlnlmll Delea'ed Drake, 1918.

Most of these homecoming games
have been with bigger schools such
as Drﬂke and Iowa. State. In most
cases the games have been close and
exciting to the last moment, but
there are some that were “walkov-
era.” In 1918, although it was not
a regular homecoming game, Grin-
nell triumphed over Drake by the
biggest score ever chalked up by eith-
81' of these two colleges, Grinnell 72,
Drake 0, though Grinnell won a home
coming game from Drake 584) in
1915. Drake. however, smashed
through the Pioneer eleven in 1908 to
win 53 to 0.

Ames' Games Exciting

That Grinnell has displayed plenty ,

of fight at Homecoming is shown in
the fact that although outscored in
total points 263 to 191, the Pioneers
have outscored their opponents by 92
to 83 in the final period, G '
has been held scoreless seven irncs,
handing her opponents "goose-eggs"
nine times. .
Probably the two most e'
games in Grinnell history were both
against Ames, one in 1924 _§nd’the
other last year. The’Pio'iieerS annex!

o 5,! .3,

ed both of them, by scores of 14 a
and 3-0. The gridiron battle of '24
is by agreement of all Grinnell parti—
“sans the most sensational. In 1924,
with Ames leading by a comfortable
margin of two touchdowns, Grinnell
rallied for a win in the last quarter.
That was the game when Morgan
Taylor, olympic track champion,
sprinted thirty yards from the center
of the field to catch a bullet pass
from “Hap” Moran and put the ball
within scoring distance for Sweet,
Pioneer half, to score the touchdown
and tie the score. Moran booted the
ball between the posts to climax a
hairrraising afternoon.

The Homecoming game last year
with Iowa state was also a thriller.
Although the Grinnell gridders kept
the crowd in suspense for three per-
iods of the game, Ruff finally booted
.a field goal to give the Pioneers a
three point margin.

The results of the Homecoming
games since 1907 are are follows:

Wilson Talks

on Japanese

People Wish to Understand
Ways of Americans,

Says Speaker. -

“Japanese people earnestly desire
the sympathetic understanding of the
American people, and believe they can
learn much from us especially in re—
gard to our love of liberty. justice.
and fair play," Mr. Raymond Wil—
son, of Morning Sun, Iowa, declared
Monday evening, speaking before a
group of girls in the Quadrangle
drawing room. Mr. Wilson was
brought to Grinneil by the World
Fellowship and Peace Committees of
the Y. W. C. A.
Studied in Japan

In 1927 he was sent to Japan for
a year‘s study of the conditions of
the country, and the life of the people
by the Japanese students of New York
City. He lived first with a Japanese
family and then in a dormitory of the
Imperial university.

In moral character and love of
justice the Japanese have much in
common with us. Mr. Wilson said.
They wish that Japan may soon edu-
cate her people so that they may co-
operate with the united States for
the peace and welfare of the whole
world.

Vividly colored costumes, woven by
headhunting tribes of Formosa, were
exhibited ,by Mr. Wilson. The gar-
,ments were the"’every day garb of

these tribes who have a civilization
comparable to that of thc American
Indian. he said.

Japanese prints were also display—
ed. The lecture was illustrated by
tinted slides picturing shrines, temc
pies, scenic spots in Japan, schools,
school children, and cities of Japan
which have become industrialized.

Western Clothes Worn

In speaking of the custbms of the
people, Mr. Wilson said that western
clothes are worn almost exclusively
in the cities, being more economical
and more comfortable.

The Alien Land laws of the wes-
tern states and the Exclusion Act
created hard feeling which is gradu-
ally being overcome, he said, by the
desire of the people for a friendly
feeling between the two countries.
The people are tremendously inter-
ested in America and American
ideals.
