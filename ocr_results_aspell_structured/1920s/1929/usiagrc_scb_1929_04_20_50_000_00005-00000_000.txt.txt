Duke Enters Men in Seven
Events at Drake

Saturday.

Mile Team Best Bet

Hair. and Quarter-Mile Quartets
also to Run Races
at Des Moines.

Although existing weather condi-
tions seem to bode bvil for those who
intend to drive to Des Moines next
Saturday, it is not expected that the
rain will impair the track in the
Dmke stadium for the annual relays
next Friday and Saturday.

Prospects for Grinncll are highest
in the mile»reiay team which showed
up well in the indoor season earlier
in the year. The team, however, did
the expected by not placing in the rev
lays at Kansas last Saturday, and
hopes are not extremely high.

Coach G. L. Duke has announced
entrance in seven events at the meet
Grinnell will enter in all of the re-
lays. mile, half mile, and quarter.
mile. The men who will compete in
the relays are- Captain McKee.
Mark, Pelletier, '1' 'lnr. Miner, Beck,
Legore, and Kelley. The tlrst tour
will probably run the mile.

In other events, there will be Tay-
lor in the high hurdles, McCully and
Douglas in the high jump, Murray
throwing the discus, and Greene and
Hensley in the pole vault.

The first tryouts (or the Men’s
Spaulding contest will be held Thurs-
, day afternoon at 1:15. in Room 124,
r A. R, H. The tryouts will consist of
one minute speeches, and all men
are eligible. Substantial prizes are
ottcred to the three place winners
in the annual affair, which will be
held this year early in May.

Team Lands Seventh
at Kansas

Grinnell‘s mile relay team, an im-
portant quartet in any tield was not
offirst place calibreugdinsl the array
or university squads which tangled at
the Kansas relays Saturday, but a
seventh place in a hold of 18 isn’t as
bad as it might have been.

The closest claim tor Pioneer hour
ors came when Taylor took second in
his boat of the lzoryard high hur-
dles, third in the seaninnls but tail-
ed to place in the ﬁnals,

ﬁrst place in the mile relay went

to the crack Missouri squad which
earlier in the season took the Texas
relay honors.

The Kansas meet was held in un—
far Table weather, part Of it during a
dri HE rainstorm and the rest on n
boggy track partly covered with Wai-
er. It was largely due to this that
the bevy of stars entered sliceeded in
breaking only two of the meet rec—
ords. Tom Warne Of Nebraska and
George Otterness Of Minneapolis l‘e-
served places for their names on the
'1st programs by clearing the bar at
13 feet 4 374 inches in the pole vault,
and Dan Beattie, Colorado Aggies

Six Piles Up Big Lead;
Four Loses Close
Battle.

Dibble Hull, touted as a certain
contender in intramural baseball this
year, lived up to all advance cl’edenr
lials Monday when it rompcd over
Langun 15 to o m the season opener.
The game was slowed up by the
poor playing of the Building Two as;
pirams, giving the Dibble men little
chance to show their lllal'it. In a
much better game from the stand-
point or interest, Kelley Stables trlur
med Building Four, 3 to 7 Tuesday.

in the opening game Dibble trotted
in tour runs in the first inning on a
pair or passes and three errors.
Du e's rluke homer in the second
lrn'me was largely responsible {or

third, one in thc iourth and three in
the filth there was no stopping the
onslaught

Wilhelm pitched great ball and was
touched for only three hits, Eilto
nudging a pair and Edmnu crashing
a double. Briggs pitched a} good game
for Two and although he was hook-
cd {or eight hits would not have pull—
ed out badly At all had he had good
support. Duke was the star of the
day at the rubber with a homer and
a pair or singles.

in the Tuesday contest between

Smith Hall is to meet Clark Hall
