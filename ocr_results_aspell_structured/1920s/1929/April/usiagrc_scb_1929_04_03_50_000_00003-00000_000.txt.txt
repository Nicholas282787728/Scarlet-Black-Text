Conquering the Cascades

Now falls every month in the
year Where the Great Northern
crosses the Cascades. Steep, tortuous
grades increase the diliiculty of the
railroading problem. Nature has stub-
bornly resisted man’s effort to conquer
the range. .

In January, 1929, the new Cascade
tunnel was opened. Man, with elec-
tricity as an ally, had con-
quered the Cascades.

The eight-mile bore was
driven in three years—a

record impossible Without: electric
power. And electriﬁcation has been
extended to the entire 75-mile route
through the mountains.

The conquests of electricity on the
land and on the sea, in the air, and
underground, are making practicable
the impossibiliries of yesterday. As
our vision encompasses wider hori-

zons, electricity appears as
a vital contribution to future
industrial progress and humam
welfare.
