Tennis Leaders
Approach Finals
of Net Tourney

The men’s tennis tournament With
the exception of one match has
reached the finals. “Chuck” De-
Long by virtue of his wins over Der
vis in the quarter finals and Beck
in the semifinals is the finialist in
the lower half, while the winner of
the Tatom-Bryan match will be fine
.alists in the upper division.

John Tatum is Still the favorite
and although DeLong should give
him some competition there seems to
be little doubt of the outcome. In

.fspite of ﬁe fact that there has been
very little time spent in practice for
these matches, there has been some
good tennis played.

The freshman have done unusual-
ly we'll. Out of the eight that were
left in the quarter-finals, there were
freshmen. Gleysteen and Robinson of
Smith Hell and Davis of Dibble.

The finals will be played off some
time during the early part of next
week.

es, alumni and athletes.

The manner of recruiting athletes
ranges from casual contacts with
players to an intensely organized
system making use of agents both on
and off the campus, One high
school athlete showed the foundation
investigator ﬁftyeeight letters an-
swering his offers to various institu-
tions to play for them if well enough
"iaken care of."

As for the employment of athletes,
the report found all varieties of
"soft” jobs being handed out to ath-
letes of promise. At Wisconsin, for
example, seventeen athletes were
found employed as trainers and rub-
hers, with a monthly wage averag-
ing 533.67.

While many of the facts brought
out by the report were common
knowledge to' must observers of Am-
erican collegiate-athletics. the report
was so sweeping that the country as

porarily by its ﬁndings and football
coaches have been busy either ex—

At the end of the third quarter
Clark lagged only by a 10-9 margin,
but the Langan team again crept
away from them in the ﬁnal period.
Eekbolrn and Hipp were outstanding
for Langan; Burt Murray played a
sweet defensive game for Five, while
Graeber was Clark's big offensive
threat.

Although only eight out of the
ﬁfteen scheduled games have been
played in the intramural speedhall
series. it looks as if Dibble and
Langen were again destined to right
it out for the championship. At the
