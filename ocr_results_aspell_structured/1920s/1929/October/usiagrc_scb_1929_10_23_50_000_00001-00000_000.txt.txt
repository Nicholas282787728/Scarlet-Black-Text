Pioneers and
Bears Play to
Scoreless Tie

Homecomers, Gary Cooper

See Grinnell Linemen
Hold in Crises.

Rain Halts Passing

McIntire‘s Punts Overcome Yards
Gained by Fast and Heavy
Backs of Visitors.

Playing hefore 2,000 gridiron fans,
including many homecomers, one of
whom was the famous Gary Cooper,
the Grinnell eleven battled through
a drizzllng rain on a soggy field to a
0 to 0 tie with Washington univer-
sity last Saturday. The score is in-
dicative of the defense of the Plo<
neers, who though the rain prevent-
ed the use of their crack serial at—
tack, held the heavy Bears to 13
first downs in the contest.

Despite the fact that the Scarlet
and Black gridmen were credited
with only seven first downs during
the game, play for nearly half of the
contest was in Washington territory.
This was due chiefly to the stellar
punting of Ernie Mclntil'e, veteran
Grinnell kicker. Whose boots outdis—
tanced those of Hornsby, st. Louis
hope, by 10 to 15 yards consistently.

The Grinnell team threatened only
once during the contest. On the
firstspmy Humphrey took Sauselle's
fumble to give the Pioneers the ov'al,
but they in turn lost on a fumble.
The Washington eleven was stopped
dead, however, and taking the ball in
midfield Grinnell advanced; to the
20 yard line where they were held
for downs.

The Washington university aggre-
gation came within striking distance
of the Pioneer goal twice in the sec—
.ond period. but‘ failed to put the ball
over either time. Early, in the
fourth quarter, starting from his
own 20 yard line, sauselle, brilliant
Bear half-back, cut loose with a pair
of 20—yard runs and a 10 yard
sprint, but again the Pioneers braci
ed their back to the goal. on three
kicking exchanges the Pioneers
worked the ball to midtield, where it
was in their possession as the game
ended,

The Washington stars for the con-
test were the scintillating trio of
shifty and speedy backs, Springer,
Wald and Sauselle. Time after time
they outrun their interference and
wove their way through Pioneer
tacklers for good yardage. McIntire
was the outstanding Grinnell star
for the day with some real kicking,
while Minier and Humphrey were
among those who registered well in
the line.

‘Patteran’ is Held
by W.A.A. Tuesday

Nearly a. hundred girls met at the
women's gym at four- fortyrfive
Tuesday, as guests of the W, A, A.
on a "patteian." The gypsies, led
by Miriam NcNally, W. A. A. preSi<
dent, followed a “Romany Trail” for
half an hour, which led back to the
w. A. A. room in the women‘s gym.
The room was decorated with
autumn leaves, pumpkins and corn
stalks. A gypsy supper was served,
after which Ruth Coodenow and
Dorothy Sells sang “The Gypsy
Sweetheart.” and “The Lonesome
Roi-1d." The patteran ended with a
search for a treasure, which was diS<
covered to he a chest full of W. A.
A. handbooks.

Taft Lectures ‘

on ‘Praxiteles’

Delivers Third of Series of
Lectures in Chapel

Last Evening.

The masters of Greek art in the
fourth century )3. C. were Praxiteles,
Scopas and Alexander," remarked
Lorado Taft in the third of his ser-
ies of six lectures at Herrick chapel
last night. The subject of the talk
was “Praxiteles and His Successors."
Ne‘xt Wednesday night, he will speak
on “Greek Art in Rome and Early
Italian Sculpture."

"Praxiteles concludes a series. He
is a bright flower of the traditions
of the past,” Mr. Taft stated, “His
forms Show a transition from State-
ly, erect figures of the Parthenon to
graceful, easy, restfully posed fig
ures."

Scopas may have lived a little
earlier than Praxiteles, but we al~
ways think of him as being of a lat-
er date because he introduced new
phases of art which gained him
many disclples.’ Onlyfour of the
original heads of this “sculptor of
tragic art" have been found. These
faces contain expressions of dra-
matic power and passion. Alexander
the Great did much to Spread the
Greek culture which he admired so
much.

"The tragedy of art,” Mr. Taft
said, is that only fragments re-
main behind and so much is passed
down to us in the form of poor cop-
ies. The copies are clumsy, they
either couldn't follow the delicacy of
the lines or they overdid it making

Payne Gives Story‘of J. B. Grinnell
in Homecoming Chapel Talk Saturday

“ ‘Josiah B. Grinnell, the unique.
in a class by himself. He grows u
on you as you read the story of his
eventful career. In these words one
of Grinnell's pioneer associates once
described him," said Prof. Charles
E. Payne at Homecoming chapel
Saturday, in a talk describing the
life and activities of J. B, Grinnell.

J. 3., as he was famil—
iliarly known, was‘unique both in his
character and his achievements. He
was unique also in that he once took
advice. It was to him that Horace
Greeley gave the advice, since he-
come historic. ‘GC west, young man,
go west.’ J. 13. went west founded a
town, projected a university, became
a pillar of Iowa Congregationalism.
turned promoter, and commonwealth
builder, and ﬁnally become a widely
known national ﬁgure.

Professor Payne outlined Grinnell’s
early life, pointing out that his early
life in New England inured him to
hard work and imbued him with
strenuous moral ideas. Grinnell
made his own way through school,
graduating from Oneida Institute,
New York, a hotbed of radicalism in
those days.

After graduation he started the
First Cangregatianal church in
Washington, D, C., where he deliver—
ed such a strong sermon against
slavery that he was forced to leave.

Going to New York, he became
a firm friend of Horace Greeley of
the New York Tribune.

”the loss of his voice compelled
Grinnell to abandon preaching and in
1854 he came to Iowa," continued
the speaker. "Here he met Gren-
ville Dodge, the great railway build-
er, who had recently’erected a flag
pole on the present site of Grinnell
while surveying west of Iowa City for
the M. and M. railway, Mr. Dodge
recommended that Grinnell lpcste his
colony where the flag pole Stead.

A: church was started within a
year by eight persons, in a long
cabin, with Grinneil as the preacher.
Grinnell University was also planned
with the funds of the Literary Tren-
sury and a gift of 343 lots from

night labor from the Community

“His interest in Grinnell did not
begin to exhaust the energies of the
founder," continued Mr. Payne, “As
early as 1856 his interests and activi-
ties hecame statewide." Assisting
in organizing the Republican party
in Iowa, Grinnell was soon elected

Tanager Has

Article by Hall

Famous Author’s Criticism
is BestvFeature, Says

Reviewer.

By Gretchen MacArthur.

James Norman Hall’s "Stevenson‘s
Thoreau” )'S unquestionably the best
article in the November issue of the
Tanager. Judged both from the
standpoint of literary value and of
permanent interest Mr. Hall's work
stands far above anything e e in
the magazine. It is a sane cr cism
of criticism.

Just as Hell feels Stevenson's crit-
icism of Thoreau a criticism of him-
self So do we feel his attitude toward
Stevenson reflecting in this article—
the critic will perhaps admit that the
modern writer's is the keener sense
of discrimination. In this article
Mr. Hall has done his best work for
the Tanager, ,

Judged as a whole the issue is
somewhat dull and trite. Miss M111!-
gan’s article, “The Book-Club
Racket" which is accorded first
place entertains but surely-does not
deserve precedence over Mr. Hall's
work. Her subject is timely and she
makes some very pertinent observa-
tions but her manner of writing and
organizing her material is Somewhat
Careless.

“The Crosby House,” the only
short story of the magazine, is of
average short story calibre. Its in-
terest lies in its use of bareness of
detail and skelton form to produce
a marked singleness of effect. Pord
Stewart's article, "This Matter of
Lines," is no doubt entertaining but
much like the work of any college
sophomore and far better material
for a college humorous publication.

Local Harriers
to Run Against 1
Penn on Friday

With one victory to their credit,
the Grinnell college cross country
men will have their second meat of
the season Friday when they tangle
with the Penn barriers at Osknlooss.
with Captain secor and Mcrlrath
leading the pack, the Pioneer run<
nets are doped for a second win.

The victory over Coe last Satur»
day was won by all of the top places
except first. Hover of Coe sped by
Secor on the home stretch but the
Pioneer captain took second and was
followed by Mcllrath, McKenzie,
Murphy and McCandless. Austin,
Heath, Davis and Walkob, all of Coe,
came in seventh, eighth. ninth and

Meet Drake
on Saturday

Grid Game Will Be Played
at Night; Is Drake's

Homecoming.

Drake’s Backs Fast

Pioneer Lille Will Get Real Test;
Salem Drills Team Against

Grinnell Passes.

“Uneasy" is scarcely the word
which might describe the head which
wears the Missouri Valley crown this
week, for Drake holds the title and
Coach 0ssie Salem’s men are headed
for a homecoming game with Grin<
nell college next Saturday night.
The two schools have clashed 35
times on the gridiron and with the
margin 20 to 14 against them in the
way of wins, with one game a tie,
the Pioneers are out for blood.

Drake has the 1929 Missouri
Valley titlespractically clinched if she
can take Grinnell into camp. The
Pioneers, on the other hand, have an
outside chance to cop if they can
put Drake out of running. The 0 to
0 tie with Washington university last
Saturday didn’t speak well for the
Grinnell chances—hut it proved to
Drake that the Grinnel! tacklers can
stop elusive backs and that a heavy
line holds no terrors for the Pioneer
forwards.

The fact that the Scarlet and
Black failed to score against the
Bears is easily accounted for when'
one considers that it was played in
the rain and the Grinnell passing at- ,
tack was out of the question, Coach
Solem realizes this and is drilling his
men daily in a pass defense,

Have Met 35 Times.

There has been only one interru ..
tion in the series of games played by
the two squads, that in 1399 when'
no game was played. Competition
.between the two teams started in
1395 when the Pioneer ramped over
the Blue and White with a 46 to 0
score. Since that time, however, the
Drake cohorts have more than even-
ed the count against the Scarlct and
Black.

In the 35 games the only tie con»
test was in 1920 when the score was
7 to 7, The Pioneers have suffered
shutout defeats at the hands of the
Bulldogs 13 times and have in turn
held Drake scoreless 11 times. In
,the entire string of contests Drake
has amassed a total of 481 points
while Grinnell‘boasts only 339. ,

Neshitt Is Drake Threat. I

There are no indications that this
margin which Drake holds over
Grinnell will be changed to any large
degree this season. while Coach
0ssie Solem banks his hopes on his
ﬁeet backs, Neshitt and King, Coach
Watt pins his colors on his all—star
passing, kicking and running back-
ﬁeld with Ruff, Thomas, Molntire
and Captain Rose working. What-
