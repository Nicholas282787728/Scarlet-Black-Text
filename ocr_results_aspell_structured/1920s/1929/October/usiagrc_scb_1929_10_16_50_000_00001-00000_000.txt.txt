BY LOUIS ROBERTSONl

Washington, D. 0. (Special to the
SCARLET AND BLACK)—

At 12:25 P.- M. on October 7, a
foreign Prime Minister in office ad-
dressed the United States Senate, for
the first time in history. Ramsay
MacDonald, governing head 02.500,-
000,000 people, spoke extemporan-
eousiy and with great feeling for
twenty minutes on the subject of in-
ternational peace, to a crowded floor
and galleries overﬂowing with hot-
ables. ‘

' A True Statesman

The Prime Minister is a handsome
man, well groomed, urbane. with a
grand manner. He' is every inch a
statesman. He began to speak in

low, barely audible tones with gath-

About Pageant

Dialogue, . Characters, and

Outline of Play are

in Contents.

As a special feature of the his—
torical pageant, “The Pioneers of
Progress" which will he presented to«
morrow and Friday evenings as part
of the uGrinheil Diamond Jubilee and
College Homecoming” festivities, the
Pageant committee have issued a
thirty-five page booklet, which will
be distributed at small cost to those
attending the production.

The booklet contains the complete
cast of characters, the outline of the
episodes of the pageant and a com-
plete dialogue of the speaking parts,
as written by Robert Y. Kerr, who
made the conversations historicauy
correct as far as possible. In many
cases the lines spoken by thecharac-
tors are the original words uttered
back in the fifties and sixties.

The booklet is dedicated to Mrs. R.
M. Haines, who came to Grlnnell in
1855 as a Pioneer in a covered wagon
and who graduated from Iowa col-
lege in 1865. Mrs. Heines has in
large part made possible the pageant,
as she has furnished much of the
historical mat‘erial used, and because
of her aid and because she is one of
the original Pioneers, it was decided
to dedicate the booklet to her.

In the scene tomorrow and Friday
nights where a covered wagon is us-
ed, there will be a real specimen of
the original covered wagons on the
stage. out of which, during the scene
are brought old churns, chests and

warmed to his subject. His voice is
deep, devoid of the American con-
ception of an“English accent." but
with a noticeable Scotch burr. In-
stantly he gained and held the at-
tention of his listeners as he pied for
peace.

Senator William E. Bordh, of Ida-
ho, Chairman of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, led the applause
which several times stopped Mr.
MacDonald. The Kellogg—Briand
Peace Pact was emphasized as having
brought a new understanding into
the relationship between nations, and
naval parity was mentioned. "Par-
ity7,” he exclaimed, “Take it, with-
out reserve, heaped up and flowing
over."

Courage Outstanding

tion and cruelty heaped upon Mr.
MacDonald by his own people several
years ago, when he dared tel/denounce

casion took on a distinctly dramatic
flavor Had be compromised then,
as many of us would in the face of
such bitter denunciation we probably
would never have heard of him. Here

“Prepping” To be Allowed
Daring Remainder of Week

Professors and upper—classmen will
see the antics of freshmen preceding
homecoming as usual this year, in
all probability. This was made pos-
sible in accordance with a decision of
the Council of House Chairmen last
spring that "prepping" could be car-
ried on as usual during the week-end
lof Homecoming. Just what each
building intends to do with the “new
boy" is not known, but it is expected
that the duties and trials of the
freshmen will be many and varied
this week.

“Prepping" as an institution was
done away with last December, in ac-
cordance with the wishes of Presi-
dent Main and the sentiment of
many upper-classmcu,

Local Coaches Believe Washington
to be More Dangerous Than
Drake Score Shows.

With Hank Thomas again hack in
uniform and taking his regular work
in scrimmage, Coach Fuzz Watt
takes pride in announcing that his
entire varsity gridiron squad will be
in shape to compete with the ball
toters from Washington university at
the homecoming game Saturday.
Fresh from a 9—7 victory over Mar-
quette. the regulars took a light
workout Monday and spent Tuesday
and today in scrimmage sessions
against the frosh outfit.

Both Grlnnell and Washington are
represented by strong teams this sea—
son and both have the same weak-
ness. lack of good reserve material.
Coach al Sharpe and his three assist-
ants, Gale Bullman, John Davis and
Ralph Kurz, have been spending the
first weeks of practice in St. Louis
trying‘ to mould a second string which
will be able to swing into action in
case of first team injuries. AS regu—
lars they have a set of veteran line-
men, headed by Captain Harvey Jab-
lonsky at guard, and there are sev-
eral sophomore backfield candidates
who serve to make the
really formidable outfit,

‘Ploneers 1923 Victor

The Pioneer mentors do not believe
that the Bears showed their best
ability in the 20’ to 0 loss to Drake
since they have a heavy and fast team
which is well organized. The Plo-
neers trimmed the St. Louis boys 7
to e at the Missouri city last year
and are gunning for a homecoming
victory this season.

Coach Sharpe has seven really out-
standing backs. Among the sopho-
more backfleld candidates are "Red"
Sauselle, Leslie Wai'd, former Ohio-
homa. Military academy star, and
Burt Springer, former all-sta’te Mich-
igan gridman. This trio runs regu-
larly with Scot Hornsby and Dick
Rawdon, lettermen. Rufus Puntney,
captain of the 1927 Yale freshman
eleven. and Clarenceax, two-year
veteran at quarterback, are also see-
ing action.

George Coaver is the lone letter-
man back at end for the Bears but
Weintge, whom locals will remember
as a basketball ace, is making a
strong bid for a regular wing post.
From tackle to tackle the Washing-
ton far outweighs the Pioneers. Paul

ably as good a tackle group as may

Grinhell Takes’
Marquette Tilt

Grlnnell Team, Uninjured,

Prepares for Saturday's
Game With Bears.

Coach Watt's grldmen upset all
the dope Saturday in beating Mara
quette a to 7 by a last minute place-
kick by Ruff from the thirty-five
yard line. or the four times that
Grlnnell has played Marquette, Grin-
nell his won three games, each time
making the winning score in the last
quarter. Ruff. Liedtke, and McIntire
were the stars for the backfield,
while Parish, Heldridge, and Minier
were outstanding in the line. Radick
played a great game at left tackle
for Marquette.

The passing of- neither side was
spectacular, although the Pioneers
ccmpleté’d five of fourteen passes at-
tempted, and missed several by very
narrow marglns, as' against only
three Golden avalanche passes, none
of which were completed. Two of
the Pioneer passes resulted in plac-
ing the ball in position for Ruff-s
brilliant place-kick with only two-
minutes left to play, which won the
game for the,’ Pioneers.

Pioneers March Down Field

In the first quarter Parish started
things by kicking off for Coach
Watt's warriors. After stopping the
Golden Avalanche on only 10 yards
from a touchdown, the Pioneers punt-
ed out of danger. Rose intercepted a

for Men, Women of Collegiate Drama

“All the World's a. stage," said
Shakespeare, and, we might add, “50's
the ‘1ibe'." For after dinner the
‘libe', becames a puppet stage across
which move the men and women of
the collegiate drama. Comedy, trag—
edy. even pathos are-enacted in the
Grlnnell college library.

It often seems that the masculine
element of Grinneli is more scholar-
ly. For up the stone steps and into
the reading room march tall, athletic-
looking lie-men, anus piled high with
ponderous volumes and heavy note-
books. That familiar countersign,
“oh»le-ole-la—ee»oh!" drifts in through
the half opened windows. Red
sweaters within move impatiently as
if in signal to red sweaters without,
but they answer not the summons
and return to their eager search for
knowledge.

With business like step and de-
termined air a group of upper class
girls enters. They adjust horn rim—

 

 

med glasses and dive for the reserve
desk with nervous twitches. Some
thumb the waiting-list impatiently
and others rush madly into the stack
room.

The freshman co-ed arrives and
the plot thickens. With practised
hand she smooths the blonde gradu-
ation gift from Second Cousin Sue.
She eyes the downstairs reading
room critically. Too many upper-
class girls are bent busily over re-
ference books. Surmising from the
subdued buzzing in the stacks that
the couples here are already made up,
she trips on up the steps and into the
reading room. Here red sweaters
abound and there' is little pretense at
study. With a sigh of relief our
heroine rushes for the nearest Honor

has taken her night out. She has

Dedication Friday.

The city of Grlnnell is this year
seventy-five years old, hence the
term "Diamond Jubilee“ applied to
this week‘s activities. Grlnnell
college is joining in the celebra-
tion because, while founded in 1847
at Davenport, it moved here in
1358 and was only saved then, an
it has been forwarded since, by
the loyalty of Grlnnell citizens, in-
cludlng J. B. Grinwell. Town and
college have grown up together;
they are therefore celebrating to-
gether seventy-five years of com-
munity existence.

When the "Grinneli Diamond Ju-
bilee and. College Homecoming"
festivities open tomorrow evening at
the High School auditorium with the
historical pageant, “The Pioneers of
Progress", the college will throw
books aside and join in all the activi-
ties of the three day celebration.

This was assured yesterday morning
when President Main announced in-
chapel that at faculty meeting Mon-
day afternoon, it had been decided to
hold no classes on Friday of this

the regular time Friday, saideresi-
dent Main. in announcing ‘ that
the awarding of Phi Beta Kappa keys
would be made at that 'time to the
two men and two women having the
highest scholarship in the senior
class. ‘

and alumnus. of course, the big event
on the week’s program will be'the
grid game between the Pioneers and
the Washington Bears Saturday af-
ternoon, but from /Thursday to Sun—

coming program ls full of varied and
interesting features.

For Homecoming'chapel Saturday
morning, Prg‘f. Charles E. Payne

Payne will speak on the life and
work 'of Josiah B. Grlnnell founder
of the city, and for whom the college

day. both city and college will
migrate‘ to Grinnell’s new airport,
where dedication services will take
place. The main address of the
morning will be given by Governor
John Hammill, after whose speech
passenger flights will be given the
remainder of the morning. In the
afternoon a full aeronautical show
will take place, coming to a climax
in a triple parachute drop from a
