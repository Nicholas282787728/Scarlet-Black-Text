‘ CthNELL-IN—CIIINA.

Tomorrow begins the annual Pioneer Chest cam-
paign, the purposes of which are to obtain-support.
for the y. M. C. A. and Y. w. C. A. in their work on
the campus, but also for Grinnell»in»chiha, the institu-
tion sponsored by Grinne'll faculty, alumni, students
and townspeople, at Techow in the province of Shari-
tung, China for the education of Chinese boys and
\girls. . ‘ .

T0 the student body, nothing merits more serious
consideration than this project in China; nothing gets
less of such consideration. -

Grinnell-in-China has become such a neglected
wait out in the cold as far as student sup-
port goes that this year the 31' organizations
have agreed to use the major portion of the Pioneer
chest contributions from students for campus pmr
jects unless otherwise directed by individual students
Only in the case of faculty contributions will the per-
centage of distribution be as in former year fifty

per cent to Gl'lllnollrianllina and fifty per cent for
local purposes.

Tlifit such a situation should arise on the Grin-
ncll campus is indeed regrettable. fliter the ycztrs of
support which tlic student burly has given to Grinnellr
inrchlna and in the face of the fact that Donald Dess-
ler, ch 29, is now touching there as the Campus' own
representative, partially dependent on campus support
for the opportunity to finish his two year term there
this year.

“What difference does it make to us whether the
Chinese are educated on not?” asks the average Grin-
nell student, who, typically American, wants his money
to stay at homc where he can see it being used. From
a selfish viewpoint it makes no differeiicc. But China
today is a nation awakening from centuries of sleep
and needs educated leaders to guide her millions of
people intelligently. If, by contributing a few hundred
dollars, Crinnell students can enable Porter Middle
school, a high school for boys, where Fessler is teach
ing, and \Vycoff high school for girls to keep function-
ing for another year, where can money be better inc
vested? It must be rembered in this connection that
a few American dollars are still necessary to carry
a Chinese boy through many weeks of school.

Harold s. Mathews, ’16, principal of Porter Middle
School, wrote Iast'year to Grinnell: “We have had to
drop this year the two highest years of Middle School
Abecause of the great decrease in money we con ex
pect for our work." If Grinnell students
change such a situation, let them support the Pioneer
Chestwholcheartcdly this week and specifically direct
that a large share of their contributions go to Grins
hell’s own project in China. '

HONORING - - —

Two celebrations have been held this month. Ouei
at which the president of the Unlted States made the
official Speech, celebrated the golden anniversary of
the discovery of light and the work of Thomas A.
Edison. It was marked by huge crowds and much
advance advertising. In such fashion does our civilizat-
tion honor materiel progress.

The other celebration honored a man who has
probably guided 71nd contributed more to American
thought than any other individual. The man [or
whose scventieth birthday anniversary a small group
of scholars gathered was John Dewey, unquestionably
the greatest of American philosophers. A man of
tremendous capabilities, John Dewey has contributed
to many fields of modern thought. His interest in
anthropology has more closely linked it with philos-
ophy and has definitellv advanced thought in both
fields.‘ He has done much constructive work in edur
cation. His writings on all these subjects have pro»
foundiy influenced many people. ‘

Last year John Dewey visited Russia and wrote
a series of personal observations which clarified for
many the situation existing there. Like all his work
they were marked by the two qualities of tolerance
and vision. the qualities which have made his Centric
butions to. modern thought contributions
