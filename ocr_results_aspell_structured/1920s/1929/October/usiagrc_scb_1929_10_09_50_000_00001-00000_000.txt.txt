GRINNELL, IOWA, \VEDNESDAY, OCTOBER. 9, 1929.

Grinnell Co-Eds ‘Hitch-Hike’ to Ames

to Join Pioneer Reunion at Big Game

mingled with the crowd, giving their
former boy and girl friends a whiff
of the glories of sorority life.

As the whistle blew and the kick-off
was performed, the on-lookers were
tense with expectancy. The first few
minutes of the game took the wind
out of. Grinnell's sails, but the crowd
pluckily yelled on. A touchdown for
the Pioneers momentarily caused a
spurt in lung power and whoopee.

As the game progressed the crowd
became more and more slow in its
exhortations for victory. Lusty calls
from the cheer leader for a few
"robe" and "fights" brought little or
no response, perhaps the psycholog-
ists can tell us why. .

A bed<raggled crowd of bitch-hik-
ers sought the long road home, but
with the Pope’s great maxim in their
hearts—"Hope springs eternal in the
human breast, man never is but al—
ways to he blest. " And, as Pollyanna
would add, we re glad the weather
was nice anyway. ‘

Steiner Talks

on Nationalism

‘Must Seek Cooperation,’
He Says to Cosmos
Club. Tuesday.

“You cannot save nationalism," Dr.
E. A. Steiner told the Cosmopolitan
club at its open meeting Tuesday ev-
ening in the Y. building, "except
through intemationalism. Narrow nae
tionalism will kill itself, as norrow
capitalism will kill itself."

“The Czarists killed themselves."
Professor Steiner went on to explain;
"the Bolsheviks .merely buried the
Corpse." The speaker told further now,
as Russian correspondent after the
Russcl- Japanese war, he had seen re»
turning soldiers, many of them
wounded and starving,- seek refuge
around the royal palaces; and how the
Cossack guards had come out and
whipped the refugees off the grounds

A not dissimilar condition is to be
found at Gastonia today, the speaker
continued. There it is not the anar—
chists nor the communists who are
sowing revolution; “It is the capital»
ists who are so blind that they cannot
read—not the ,newspapers and magn-
zinesyibut the signs of the times."

Preparations under the direction

on at a rapid pace. The women’s
gymnasium has been turned into a
workshop where settings and cos-

On the edge of the stage will be
sen the rear of an old prairie schoon-
er, from which will emerge the pio-
neer settlers. Many of these are ac-
tual dscendants of the men and
women who came in '59. ‘

Every effort is being made for ex-
act reproduction of the time. People
helping with makeup are studying
old pictures down at Child's studio to
insure correctly shaped beards and
realistic costume. The old churns.
iron kettles and dishes used in the
pageant are in most cases articles
actually brought to Iowa‘by the early
settlers. Attics and store-rooms were
gleaned for properties, which are
now mostly on hand. Of special in~
terest are those collected for the sa-
loon sceneisaidi to _'be one of the

Pioneers Lose .
to Iowa State

Grinnell Puts Up Good Fight
But Loses 27-7

Decision.

The Pioneer gridiron warriors took
a. 27-7 beating from Iowa. State Sat-
urday, in retaliation for last year's
so Crinnell victory. Rose and Ruff
did good work for Grlh‘nell, Ruff was
on the sending end of most of Grin-
neil’s passes, many of which were in-
complete.

However, while R. o s e w B. s
a big portion of the defense, making
many of the tackles, Traugsr and
Barnes were the mainstays for the
winners, the former making two of
their four tDuchdowns, and kicking
three points after touchdowns, he-
sides reeling off yard after yard bo-
hind wonderful interference for many
of Ames' gains. He accounted for

one of Ames' touchdowns with a ‘57;

yard run. {
Pass Makes Coal

Ames simply had too much power
for the lighter Pioneer team. Many
of Grinnell’s running plays were
stopped dead at the line or the run-
ner was nipped behind the line for a
loss. The Pioneer air attack failed
because of hurried tosses as the line
gave way. Coach Watt's warriors
resorted to many passing plays in
order to gain ground. but only a few
of these were successful. The one
touchdown was the only tangible re-
sult of their air attack.

Accumulating it ﬁrst more downs
against Grinnell's eight, the cyclones
made two of their touchdowns in the
first quarter, one on a pass from the
twenty yard line, and the other on
Trauger's long run.
13>0 in Ames' favor. Grinnell got its
only touchdown in the second quart-
er on a pass from Ruff to Thomas on
the thirteen yard mark. Ruff place-
kicked the goal for the extra point.

The Cyclones started a march
from the ﬁfty yard line early in the
thirdtquarter which resulted in their
third touchdown of the day.
In the fourth quarter Grinncll lost.

Just a Week and a Half and We Will Be
Celebrating and Rooting at Homecoming

Farmers from Searsboro and Mon-
tezuma will drive over with their
families in mud-speckled Cbevrolets
to see the new airport. Every grin—
ning kid in town will get into the
ball game by some hook or crook to
secretely dote on his particular scar-
let and black hero, and dream of the
day when he shall make the sensa-
tional touchdown of the history of
mankind.

Governor to Talk l’

The honorable governor of our tall
corn land will tear himself away from
duties of office and family, arid
journey to this all important section
of his domain to mingle with his
motley subjects.

Most esteemed of all celebrities on
that gala day will be the "sons and
daughters of old Grinnell." A group
of last year's graduates will pass
today‘s high and mighty seniors with
sophisticated. worldiy~wise gazes.
Two prim damcs back for their twen-
tieth reunion will sit in Mears parlor
and shriek with horror when they
hear the rumor that the girls in

their own dearly beloved Alma. Mater
should partake of such a shocking
thing as a Chesterfield, ”oh mercy!"

Bill and Chuck will swap yarns of
the good old days when they took
their girls for a. Walk every Saturday
night, went to romantic box supper
Socials. and beat Drake two years.

nusy Cleaning

For the next fourteen days we
shall be busy house cleaning and pre»
paring for the entertainment of our
ancestors. Then we shall wreck our
voices trying to out—shriek them at
the game, trying to describe the
glories of the new picket fences, the
ripping Dean of. Men. and the T-bone
steak that the novel quad chef pro-
duces.

Then years from now we shall ﬂy
over for another Homecoming, scorn
the twenty new building erected
since our day, and brag about those
good old days when we played some
real games of football and were re-
quired to go to a class now and then.
“Nope, Grinnell ain't what she used
to be.”
