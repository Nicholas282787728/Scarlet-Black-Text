A MEN‘S UNION.

The scholastic standing of Grinnell has been cul‘dpdrr
able to the Tanking of Eastern schools. In the Past few
years, however, Grinnell has consciously or unconscious.

Elmld Coloart, w
l-lnyh Edwards. 31

ly lowered her entrance requirements. In a number oi
cases people who have tailed to meet the standards at
the Eastern Schools have had little ditticulty in enter-
ing Grinnell.

it is a question whether Grinnell has the appeal to
high school students that it should have. There is no
doubt that many 01 the existing customs on the campus

are a detriment to thc rcputatlon of the college. The
college has iound it necessary to make a rule, forcing all
students to eat college meals. With such a law in exist-
ence, the college can serve the poorest kinds oi meals,
in the most shabby manner, and have no tear or losing
money. This rule would not he necessitl'y if the meals
were satisfactory. For the price paid, the students are
entitled to well cooked meals, served in an appetlzing
manner. Tlle biggest problem at present is the man-
ner of service in the dining room. Student help is no
doubt to blame. But this could be remedied by employ-
ing waiters on a more business-like and professional
basis. A student earning his board by waiting tables in
an outside restaurant could not think of getting by, with
such careless service as is allowed to pass in the dnrmi-
tories. It is extremely doubtlul if any high school stil-
dent visiting the dining room would look forward to
eating his meals in such a place iol- {our years. It is
up to the college to provide a more reiined dining room
service than it now hits. The existing system is 2. dis»
grace to the institution. A step toward solving this
problem would be :t Men's union.

, GOOD CENTS.

“The boy with ahihty will get to his destination in
the business world quite regardless ci a college edue
cation." declares Dr. Harold 1'“. Clark, prominent educzle
tor who has spent nearly a year in studying this condi—
tion. He goes on to say that a college education is n
distinct detriment to the earning capacity of American
youths! it sends persons into prniessions which are ale
ready overcrowded and rohs them of me daring attitude
which is essential to business success.

It is tutilc to condemn this statement with a dis

dainiul reply that modern )olltll do not attend instilu- .
It the

tions at higher lrarning for commercial reasons.
majority had even this noble a purpose, conditions would
be much improved. not suppose collegiate training does
lower the earning power?

Americans are too anxious to base all judgments up—
on dollars and cents. The populace runs from this ex—
(name to that or the superaesthetio. Why not look at
the business at getting an educrttlun from a sensible
angle? _

in the lirst place, uniortunate as it may seem to
the self-made business men. modern youth is beginning
to have some respect tor intellect. The boy of today is
not content to settle down in the ”ain't" ruts or his
lather and mother, or of his acquaintances Even though
the iinal check—up may show that he has lost dollars in
obmining no education, it will likewise Show that he has
added something infinitely more villllahle to the permr
nnent worth and beauty or the earth than a filling sta-
tion or a water fountain—The UNIVERSITY DAILY
