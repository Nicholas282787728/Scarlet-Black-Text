CHINA AVVAKESi

China has often been described as the “Sleeping
Giant" or the “Sleeping Dragon," and those who
heard Mr. Fail'fl'eld‘s talk in A. R. H. auditorium last
Thursday evening got a broader view of this land of
tremendous potentialities.

China is at present a land of tremendous brrt un-
organized power. Her vast wealth of resources is as
yet unexploited, and the power to be derived from her
four hundred millions of inhabitants is as yet un-
realized becausc of lack of organization. The Chinese
situation is woi-diy of close scrutiny,
cause as she becomes organized and solves her ln<
ternnl problems, her great economic power in terms
of men and resources will make her one of the most
prominent actors in respect to industry, trade, military
and political power on the stage of international af-
fairs.

China's great resources and her eager reaching out
for western financing and scientific organization and
management in the developing of these resources will
make her a very real competitor in the field of intern
national industrial competition. As the United states
is at present leading in this field China's advances in
this respect are important to us. In the realm of trade
China's potentialities loom large on the international
horizon. At the present time England and the United
States are the chief competitors in world trade, but
if China becomes organized her resources and man-
power force recognition in the field of trade as well as
of industry. ‘

From a. military’standpoint also, organized China
would be a great world power. Her four hundred mil-
lion inhahitants provide a great fighting machine
which would be a menace to world peace if once or-
ganized by some able, but unscrupulous genius.

If China is able to solve her international affairs
her participation in these three most important
branches of world affairs is certain. For this reason
the solution of her problems in itself is a subject of
intense interest, Briefly, China's internal problems is
threefold. She is trying to change from a personal
dilatory monarchy to a democratic form of govem<
ment, she is trying to throw off the inefficient Man-
chu dynasty which has been the chief source of folk
eign concessions in China. and she is trying to be-

A few years ago the people of America felt that
the Chinese situation was perhaps interesting, but not

vitally important. Today, however four thousand
miles separating the United States from China can
not mirch longer prevent the relations and interests
of the two countries from closely interlocking.

Whether American statesmen and business men
wish it or not, the rising giant of the Far East from
now on must claim an important part in their plans,
as it will claim a growing share of interest of all
thinking people.

A, E. T.

MUSSOLINI’S LATEST THREAT.

During the past few years, the Chicago Tribune
and its school have repeatedly warned all 100 per cent
Americans to watch hearth, home and growing chil-
dren against the activities of insidious Communism.
But it was not until this month that the real danger
to the United States became known, through Marcus
Duffield's amazing article in Harper-s for November on
"Mussoliui's American Empire,” revealing the domin-
ation of four million Americans of Italian extraction
by the methods of Mussolini and his Fascisti. operating
from abroad.

Mr. Duffield odds climax to climax in his article.
He tells of the political organization which the Italian
dictator has set up in the United states to claim the
allegiance of Italo-Americans and to enforce their
obediance. He tells of the establishment of Fascist
schools and courts in the United States, of the Col-
lection of taxes from American citizens for his uses
in Italy. He offers proof of the most amazing thing
of all: the seizing of Italo—‘Amcricans traveling in
Italy, including naturalized American citizens, and
compelling them to serve ‘trnining periods in the Ital—
iau reserve army. The “great” Il Duce has no naturals
rzation agreement with America, and Mr. Dufficld
quotes him in Herpors as declaring: "My order is that
an Italian citizen mrrst remain an Italian citizen, no
matter in what land he lives, even to the seventh gen—
eration."

Every college student should read for himself the
almost unbelievable details related by Mr. Duffield.
He sees then that Mussolini is planning to keep
half a million soldiers loyal to him in the war
which he plans for the future, that through his Amr
crican empire he is trying to quiet all criticism of his
regime in the United States, that his credit resources
in this country may not be cut off.

When one finishes the article and reilects as to
the man behind all these activities, the Kellogg Pact,
that most “radical” step of Americans toward world
peace, the World Court and the coming Disarmament
conference fade into dimness. Even the League at
Nations, with its guarantees against war, seems to
tolie a back seat. For one is convinced more than
ever that none-of these organizations can prevail
against the national sggrandizement which constitutes
Mllssolini's rock foundation for the place of Italy in
the sun, when 11 Duce conceives that the time has
come to strike for Italian greatness. World Peace can
never be a certainty with the Italian Dictator seated
enthroned in Italy as he is today.

The State department, fortunately, is at last look-
ing into conditions. The rcyelations of Mr. Duffield
will doubtless cause the American press and people
to stand to their guns against such averrweeni‘ng
brandishing of power. Our national welfare, our ef-
forts toward assimilation of the masses of immi—
grants whose labor in America and yet who reside
mentally in their native land can be greatly aided if
intelligent Americans will be on guard in the fut-
ure, and ready to cooperate in any measures to stamp
out Mussoliui’s propaganda.

But what of world peace? Each day it becomes
less of a reality, as long as Il Duce's power increases,
The sooner the nations of the world come together
and clamp down on Mussolini-s activities, the better.
The details of such a program will be difficult. Per—
haps it may be an economic boycott; perhaps by a re-
fusal on the part of Americans and others to extend
further credit to Italy. But those who know their
history realize that until Mussolini is brought to un—
derstand that Italy has no more right to the sun than
any other nation, then all the peace machinery men

ma set u will not avail.
