“It is important to have first an
all around cultural education,” Mr.
Ingham remarked several times dur-
ing his speech. “Know about the
world in which you live. Be inter-
ested in and know about everything
in detail. Then, if you can afford it,
and have the time, take up a detailed
study of journalism. Get into the
work where ever you can; take any
job at the beginning, trom then on
it is easy to shape the course. There
is much room at the top, but not
much at the bottom. Brains and ens
ergy are what are needed.”
