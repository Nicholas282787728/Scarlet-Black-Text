WELCOME TO OLD GRADS.

This week, Grinnell of the pres-
ent entertains Grinnell of the past.
It is a pleasure to have old gradu—
ates here looking ovxer the pres
ent student body. No doubt there
will be remarks that the place
”isn't what it was when I was
here.” However, it is hoped that
the older generation will be chari-
table. '

New Grinnell welcomes the
Grinnell of other generations.

NO. 61.

GRINN'ELL, 1928-29.

While many changes have taken
place in Grinnell during the last
year, tlle college has remained es-
sentially the same. Prepping,
cept forbne week, has been abol-
ished, a new chapel hour has been
set and a new system of sponsor-
illg dances by organizations has
begun. ‘

The traditional Grinnell activi-
ties have had a good year. The
football team, playing its usual
hard schedule, won more than half
of its games and lost the others by
small margins. The basketball
season, While less successful, show.
ed the Pioneers giving strong com-
petition to some of the best teams
in this section: Coggeshall won
the Central Intercollegiate and
Missouri Valley tennis titles, and
With Stowe won both of the

doubles titles. The track team
won the indoor valley meet: and
was third in the outdoor one.

The publications have been up
to the usual standard. The SCAIL
LET AND [BLACK has, as always,
interpreted the news week by
Week and the Malteaser has pub-
lished a series of interesting issues
under two 'managements. The
Cyclone proves to be well gotten
up.

Three plays have been presented
this year. “Expressing Willie,”
three “Mystery Plays” an :1
“Windows." In addition, three
one-act plays written and directed
by Grinnell students were given
this winter. This is the ﬁrst time

The Undergraduate speaking
..,stcin inaugurated in Grillncll
this year brought one speaker to
Grinnell this year. Two were sent
out by Grinncll this year.

THE STUDENT BODY.

This year, more than in any
others, graduates see the campus
as 't really is at commencement
time. .-\t. the invitation of the
commencement committee, sopho-
orcs and freshmen and i7, large
part of the school are staying over
the last clays of school, Pl‘,0Vl-
ously, mlderelassnicn were asked
to leave as soon as their examina-
tions were ﬁnished.

There is no doubt that this has
added much to the value of com-
nlenccnlellt. In other years, visit-
ors have come here during the
last Week and wondered just
where Grimlell really was. They
have seen the campus and a
sprinkling of seniors, but have
missed over half of the school.

While Griunell has a beautiful
campus, especially at this time of
the year, after all, it is the stud-
ents who make Grinnell .1 living
place. Buildings and equipment
are certainly important, beautiful
surroundings are nice, but it is the
student botly which actually
makes the institution.

This week, the modern Grinnel-
lien is being inspected by the
older one.

the actual Willingness and desire on
the part. cl students who have musical
instruments to Come out and play in
the band.”

For two years he led the band of
Ripon college. which he was attending

“What personal bcuclits should one
obtain from playing in the band?"
the scribe inuuired. “Students learn
to stick to an organization through-
out the year. Often they must sacri—

The problem this year of unitorm-

by the buying of several caps. Mr.
