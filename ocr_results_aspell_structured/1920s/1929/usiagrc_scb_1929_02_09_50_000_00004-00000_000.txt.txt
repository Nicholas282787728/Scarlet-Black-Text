Iowa College Given
Silver Dollar For
First Gift In‘1844

In that little town 0! Denmark‘.
Iowa, Gl'inuell college received its
first monetary contribution in 1344.
It was during a meeting held in that
year that Rev. J. J Hill tossed a sil-
ver dollar upon the table with this
remark: “! am giving one dollar for
the founding of a Christian college
in Iowa. Appoint your trustees to care
for that dollar.”

From that start a movement ree
suited which finally ended in the
acquiring of a charter {or such a col-
lege, the first college in Iovin. To oi»
tain money for this new enterprise it
was voted to sell a township of land
and to send agents east to solicit
funds. The charter was issued on Jan-

.iiary A. 1847, less than a year aiter .

the state was admitted to the Unior

Until 1254 the college was located
in Davenport, Iowa, when it moved to
its present location in Grinnell, Up
until this time classes were held in
the basement ol the Presbyterian
church, The tirst college hiiiiding was
7. small, onerstOl'Y building which
served as a chapel and class room.
In this year, 1554, the first class of
two was graduated at Davenport. The
two classmates were brothers. WiL

what the president-elect will do to
