Duke to Enter
Thirteen Men
in Valley Meet

Athletes Will Compete in All
Events Excepting Mile;
May Win Tourney.

May Get Fifty Points

'Tayior Expected to Win Hurdle
Events With Secor Given

Chance in Two—Mile.

Thirteen Grinnell trackmen will
take off tonight for Stillwnter, Okla,
to do great things—or perhaps to see
others do great things. The men
making the trip are Douglas, Ed-
wards. Greene, ingram, Kukolich,
Mark. McKee. McCully, Pclletier.
Hensley, Taylor, Murray and Secor.
Coach Lester Duke has entered men
in every event of the outdoor Mis-
souri Valley meet except the mile
run, ‘

Washington Strong in Field

The Grinnell track men. undefeated
'this year, and with one of the most
well-balanced squads entered, should
be near the top of the entries at the
close of the meet. If is points takes
the meet Grinnell should win and
with a few breaks the local tracksters
should come close to the 50 mark.
Regardless of who wins the meet, it
will he a close battle between Grin-
nell, Washington and the Oklahoma
Aggies. Washington boasts strong
iield men but Grinnell should match
them on the cinders and slip in
enough points on the field to keep
things interesting.

Walther Best Ill High Jump

Taylor is expected to cop both hur<
die events with Hensley placing in
both of them, With this as a start,
two places in the uuarter mile will
look good to the home folks and Se-
nor is good for a first or a second
in the two mile. Counting a first in
the mile relay and a place in the half
mile relay gives Grinnell upwards of
so points on the races alone.

Wehber ot Washington is the choice
of the critics for the high jump but
McCuliy and Douglass will be up in
the running and places in the broad
jump, javelin and weight events
should put the Pioneers well over lo.

"I wanted to beat Harris today," he
remarked, wiggling his toes reflectr
ively. “I won from him early in the
year last summer but he trimmed me
later on, This kind of evens the

The grin developed into a chuckle.

Valley May Hold ,
No Net Tourney

With the Grinnell tennis team in
Des Moines today playing Drake nni—
versity. it IS not likely that there will
be any Missouri Valley tennis tour—
nament this year. Creighton does
not hftve a tennis team this ‘year and
all or the other teams have played.
Grinnell has already defeated
the Oklahoma Aggies and Washing—
ton uoiversity to say nothing of
trouncing Drake in Chicago.
Although official word has not been
given out calling or fthe Missouri
Valley meet it is likely that it will he
issued heiore tomorrow. if such is
the case today's match with Drake
will serve as the finals or the Mis»
sonri Valley tournament. There is
little question but that the Grinnell
team will deteat Drake, who barely
managed to tie Washington univer-
sity, who lost to Grinnell 6 to 1, but
there will be much interest in the
singles championship match between
Brody and Coggeshaii and the doubles
affair with Brody and Everett match—
ed against Coggeshail and Stowe.

Margaret Coddington went to Mt.
Pleasant. for the week-end.
