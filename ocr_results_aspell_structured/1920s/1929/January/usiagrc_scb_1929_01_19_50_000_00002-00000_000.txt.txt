Friday night inioriiials seem to be gaining invar
with the students, especially since the decision to allow
dancing. A low more innovations such as this and the
varied notions concerning Griiinell's deplorable social
situation will be largely dissipated. We should suggest
as worthy ot consideration more mixed dinners, and Ada
diticnal emphasis upon the Friday and Saturday night
special privileges.

A NEW h‘l-zliil.

How much chance is there at Grinnell tor those iew
students who are intellectually inclined to ohtain the
henetits derivahle troni association with others or their
kind? Considering the organizationS#Lantern is a group
of the popular leaders. interesting enough. but ex-
clusive; Forensic tails into the same category; most at
the other men’s and Women's organizations, with the pos-
sible exception oi the science club, are rather lethargic.
The logical center or things is the dormitory unit, but
there the organization and programs must not concern
themselves with things intellectual tor tear oi becoming
extremely unpopular. Only in the private/confines oi
their rooms, behind locked and guarded doors, can the
poor, misguided souls who thirst tor knowledge satiato

their longing. And then the news may leak out.

Well oi course the situation isn‘t quite as bad as
tllnL But it seems to us that one very serious detect
nith the organization ol Grinncll life is the lack oi
ample opportunity [or things of the mind. Admittedly,
the classroom, as now conducted here, fails to meet the
need. Organizations have other matters in hand. The
dormitories fail utterly in this respect, and as it result
what little intellectual interest we have here goes either
into hibernation or stagnation. ’

Just as an cxperilnenl thc buildings iiiigiit undertake
some sort of work along this line. They might try to
stage an "open ioruiii“ smoke ~, or, lailiug in that, bring
iogciticiv by some means those within their building who
care to engage in constructive and licueticial exchange
or ideas. Perhaps we are wrong, but we tcel that there
may bu, quite a low who would respond to such a pros
grain, t‘eltillllly, no i‘inei- contribution could be made
to Grinnell lire than the stirring and quickeniug of brain
and imagination on the more serious issues heiore us,

that several hundred thousand oi these machines, which

would be enough to make the situation acute were it
not tor the (act that the machines themselves make the
