Study Hours Are Possible.

Those who were in the neighborhood of the dormitories
this week when freshman grades were issued for the first
months work heard a series of gasps, ejaculations. and excla-
mations of sad wonderment from the first year men. For the
first time, the newest of the Grinnell student body have come
up against concrete evidence that more serious and continued
concentration is necessary in college than in high school.
Many will doubtless apply themselves from now on. But in
trying to do so they are bound to face the problem of just
where and when a man can study in the dormitories, where
quiet hours are more of a fiction than the story of Eve and the
apples of the Garden of Eden. _

Technically, quiet hours exist from eight o’clock on in the
dorms. By eight o'clock all good students and true are sup-
posedly thrilling to the creation of a masterly theme or otherr
wise joyousiy engaged in the pursuit of knowledge, The actual
facts disclose these same students trying to decide the
weighty question of which phonograph record to play next
or of where to go to find the best (or worst) “session." What
wonder the poor freshman throws books Skyward in dismay
and forgets the worries of learningiuntil grades come out!

Contrary to a popular belief of long standing, the purpose
of coming to college is to achieve wisdom through processes on
thought engendered by study. How to obtain tolerable cone
ditions of study is one of the real problems on the campus th-
day. The Dean of Men and the Council of House Chairmen,
as well as the Lantern, have recently given much time to the
question. It can never be settled until each individual in the
dorms will agree to forego any plans of his which will inter-
fere with the maintenance of quiet hours in any way.

That progress may be made, we recommend that
building hold a serious meeting, if that be possible, at which
the Dean of Men explains to the doubting ones why quiet
hours are valuable to the building as a whole; he would have
plenty of ammunition in the already mentioned freshman
grades. Then we suggest that the House councils be empower-
ed by the men of the various dorms to lay a fine, a heavy one
if need be, on those who continually violate the hours from
eight on by creating noise disturbing to those who wish to
study. Finally, we recommend a much more serious respect
for study itself among the men'of the college, for such respect
must precede respect for the hours of study. ,

The thought persists that at least if one isn’t interested
himself in good conditions for concentration, he should give the
poor freshman a chance, who heard long before coming here,
through college publicity, of our ideal dormitory system —
those wonderful places where men find just the right atmos-
phere to work efficiently. Here is one place where, if Grin-
nell men will cooperate, college publicity can become col-

each

lege reality. E D

Women in Business.

. Every year an increasing number of college women are
seeking positions in business. some of these are trained but
the majority have nothing to offer but a degree, a certain
amount of intelligence and enthusiasm.

Naturally enough this enthiusiesm lessens when they are
refused positions in one organization after another because
they "lack experience.” They realize that a college education
is not something upon which they can capitalize.

A recent interview with a placement director of 'a large
city agency for college women revealed that there are ample
.cpportunities for the woman with an economics or business
major but that the woman who has majored in some depart
ment of liberal arts,and has no knowledge of business pro-
cedure is a liability few employers care, to-take.

"Learn to type" this placement director advises. She ex-
plained how often she was able to place an unexperienced COI—
lege woman in a position offering advancement because she
could type. It might be only ten minutes typing each day but
the woman who could hold the position must be able to do
that typing in that time.

More and more Grinnell women graduates are planning
business careers. A number of these are majoring in business
but unless they have had stenographic training before or plan
to go to business school after graduation none of them are
equipped to fill the majority of beginning business positions
open to women. ' ,

We strongly urge that the college provide facilities where-
by women may, without college credit, learn typing. It would
undoubtedly be a forward step that would make for the more

rapid-placement of college women in business positions.

He.—

Editor Scanet and Blatck’ .
There are social and economic con-
troversies and disturbances because
there is something of right on more
than one side. When there are add-
ed such factors as misunderstanding,
sensationalism, emotionalism and
most insidious of all, deliberate pro-
poganda, then there follow prejudice,
hate and violence. Justice and pro-
gress do not follow in their path.
The Scarlet and Block of No—
vember 9th offered its readers an edi-
torial entitled “Cotton Mill War”. It
reminded its readeis that, “particu-
larly is it difficult for us to obtain
perspective on conditions in North
Carolinaiand—it is important for us
to know—and to. form some definite
opinion”. Pity the collegiate mind
forced to form an opinion from the
one sided promotion type statements
which followed: Employers and mill
owners, inferentially, wer'e condemn-
ed, the courts of North Carolina were
ridiculed with imputed injustice,
while the distress of mill workers
was played up by the statements and
cases of selected individuals.

This reply to the editorial as men»
tioned, is not for the purpose of exe
onerating or glorifying any of the
combatants of "The Cotton Mill
War”. It is for the purpose of re~
minding how easy it is to .condemn
most what is partially understood!
and to point out one or two facts for
consideration.

In the ﬁrst place, it is pertinent to
the subject to recall that the ”poor”
cotton mills were established; in-
dustry did not make them “poor".
0n the other hand, the mills were
welcomed and encouraged for the
employment of a large and impover-
ished population, These mills have
been benefactors to the people by
raising the standard of living under
which they once existed. The Octob-
er issue of the Review of Reviews
has an article entitled "The Work-
shop of the Carolinas“ which may
well be read in attempting to "form
an opinion".

The following facts are taken from
the June 7th, 1929 report of the
standard statistics company:

“Prior to 1921 one of the most pro»
sperous branches of American busIe
boss, the cotton goods manufacturing
industry, .has in recent years become
one of the Country’s pauper trades.
In only two of the last eight years.
1923 and 1927, have the majority of

proﬁtable basis. Moreover. in Iuoth
these years a large part of earning
Wa_s due to inventory appreciation,
reflecting rising raw cotton prices,
and not to manufacturing opera»
Lions. In the other six years, most
producing organizations were able to
Show IiLtIe or no proﬁt, with the
result ‘that in numerous instances
the generous surpluses built up be-
fore 1921 have now been dissipated.
For the year 1928, out of thirty-four
representative companies on which
reports have been made available,
seventeen showed net losses."

It is not difficult to give additional
evidence that the cotton manufacturr
ing industry has been, and is, in a
depressed condition. Perhaps no
branch of American business has
shown, since the War, such unsaus~
factory earnings and losses in capital
values. The causes are given as
over-production, increased cost of
raw materials and operating expens-
es together with lower sales price
for cloth.

Wages, as paid by an employer is
oiIe part, but only one part of our
total social income distributed. Mans
ngement is entitled to its compensa-
tion: the investor of funds is like-
wise justiﬁed in B. share of the ins
come. Wages, however, are paid in
advance of any definite income rer
turned to the employer. Thus, a
wage earner is given certainty of re»
ward for his efforts Without Waiting
and in return gives up rights of

 

ployer assumes the risk and delay of
getting baclr the total of wages and
other expenses paid in advance, and
hopes to receive also his rightful re-
turn. Ho retains control to assist in
arresting thosc forces which would
other-Wise dissipate income.

Is there not some justiﬁcation,
then, for the emphatic “No” which is
given to Union demands which seek
to encroach upon management rights
and those factors of a company's
op e r a tionz Employment is a
fundamental right of management.

Forcover, in the demand of the mill[

workers of the South for increased
wages, should there be forced upon
management additional loss when in
all equity income should be divided?
From this viewpoint the demands of
the workers are little less than an
attempt to coerce charity.

in conclusion, let our opinions be
derived from fair and full considera-
tions. May we sympathize and as~
sist all in distress and in human fair-
ness condemn wisely.
