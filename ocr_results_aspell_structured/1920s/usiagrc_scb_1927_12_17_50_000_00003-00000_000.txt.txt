PRINCE ALBERT is the kind of a
smoke you get clubby with, right
off the bat. You’ll be calling each
other by your ﬁrst names after the
very ﬁrst pipe-load. It is so gen—
uinely friendly, in spirit and in
fact.

P. A. treats your tongue and
throat as gently as a mother
handles a new-born baby. Never
a bite. Never a patch. These are
details, of course. The thing you’ll
remember longest is that wonder-
ful taste! So cool, so sweet, so

soothing.
