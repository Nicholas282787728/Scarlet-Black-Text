yearling Squad Appl‘nrs Forilu'llulile
According to lirports lswut-tl Prom
St. Louis School.

St. Louis, Oct. SD—\\'nshingtail's
trcshman iootbail candidates, under
lhe direction or Coach Davis and as-
sistanhcoach Ingamelis, have been
making a brilliant showing r sainst the
varsity anti are certain to put up a
stir: battle against the Grilluell irosh
when the yearlings clash on rrancis
iield, November 6.

Although the squad is much smaller
than that oi last year, it contains some
real grid stars who possess both light,
iiig spirit and natural iootbail ability.
The varsity can well testily as to the
ab ty oi the husk'y iirst year men,
tor the varsity hospital list shows that
among those injured in scrimmage
against the yearlings are such stars as
Captain Mahan and "Mickey" McDon-
ongb This 'new talent is certain to
holster up the Bears varsity squad
a great deal next season. ‘

In the hackiieid, the work or Har-
nett and nickie,,candidates tor the
full—brick position, is promising. Al.
hair—back, l-lassier, who starred on the
Soldan High ioothall eleven, shows up
well. ‘Duncan is the outstanding quar-
terrback among the yearlings. 0n the
line Berlinger and Glazier, at the end
positions, have done good work.
Schimmers, raris and Comstock ap~
pear to be 'the pest among the tackle
aspirants while prominent among the
guard candidates are Morin, Jablon-

\sky, Friedman, and Mess, an ullrcity

guard who played on the Roosevelt
High eleven last season. At center
both Schleb and Simms have proved
that they can handle the pigskin.

According to Coach Davis the pres-
ent freshman football squad is the
best he has seen at Washington in
many years, and he is conﬁdent that
the eleven will emerge victorious in
its battle with the Griuiicll FI‘Osh.

“Japan Does Not Dare Seize the

“Even ii the Philippines were a pile
on rock and sand they would be worth
$10U,000,000 to the United States," Mr,
H Hulbcrt told a Scarlet and Black
reporter today. “They belong to a
chain or islands along the coast that
is the very key to Chmit's heal . All
the islands except the Philippines be
long to Japan, and by a recent disarm»
ament treaty the United states prom—
ised to have no lortilications ther .
It Japan wants to seize the Philip-
piiics it is our duty to go to war, but
in my opinion Japan would not dare
do this as long .is the United States
holds the protectorate,

“The minute Japan dcclamd war on
the United States she would have
Korea, China, and Russia ready to
pounce on her. “more would she bor-
row money? Where would she get her

"There is naturally not a shred or

told the reporter in answer to a ques-
tion as to the danger or Russian

accept Russia's money but when she
has used all she needs she will desert
he Bolsherism tlourisbes in lnduSr
trial countries, China, although she
is gradually submitting to industriaL

thrives.”

When asked it he thought it would

“If Jllnan had a bushel ol chips on

M H. )3, Hulbcrt last night at Her-
rick chapel in his address “when East

“Japan and Chlnu ill'e essentially dif—

and this is the basis of [he must seri-

of Japanese behavior. This cuncep/t—
ion was rerever coniirmed in the
minds of ,llllJaIlese when Admiral
Perry succeeded in opening up Japan
with three small gunboats and his
Yitnkee bluff.

Korea wits Victim

"If Japan had been let alone for
thirty years she would have accepted
western civilization or her owii accord
and would have become a splendid re—
public.” the speaker said, "but wlth
such an example or successiul militar—
ism before her, she sent ollt to follow
in the' footsteps OI her teacher. Little \
Korea, with it standing army of Sixty
tiger hunters, was her victim. Koreaq
is an object lesson.

“We cannot, as a nation pledged to
protect, take our hands from the Phil»

mei'ce and international relations."

Alter repeated injustices to Korea,
in 1904. at the beginning of the Russo;
Japanese war, Japan took Korea as
her ally and swore to the world that
she would protect her. At the end at
the war Japan chose the sword. in the
Tokio earthquake 3,155 Koreans were
killed outright by Japanese. In 1905,
when Korea. was being over run by
Japanese who tried to force Korean
officials to sign treaties that would
have destroyed her independence, the
president or the United States refused

speaker said. “The American psuple

show that they were not a negligent

America will feed them if they are

she Will let them die ”

hiscussos League

After explaining the condition in
the East, Ml', Hulbert turned [0 the
reason why the United States did not
enter the League of Nations. He said
in part: “In the [all ol‘ 1316, Japan
sent d messnge to England saying that
they would send 1,000,000 men to
France it England woiiid as me them
