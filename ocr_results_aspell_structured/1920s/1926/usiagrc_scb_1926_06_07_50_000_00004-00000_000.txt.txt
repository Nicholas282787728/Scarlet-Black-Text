God The Unseen

The thing that comes to pass, the
flesh, to use the word of John, does
not make the truth. It is merely the
’nstrument or agent of the truth. It
'is the incarnation of the truth, the
Word, the cosmic energy, Spirit, God,
whatever word we use, is before all of
its appearances and manifestations. It
is the unseen that is creative and eter-
nal. It is the ultimate reality. “in the
beginning, Gad."

Truth, spirit, intent in the nature of
things has been on the alert through
all the ages for means of expression,

No Conﬂict in Truth

The truth that has not yet projected
itsell into human experience or u orld
experience '3 seeking expression with
uncuding and passionate 7 al. God is

seeking a world of men for the denu‘
cosnlic‘

onstration of his love, The
energy is seeking its realization in the
limitless realm oi world and sky. It
is the spil' back of all that makes
alive in either case. The real world
is beyond the world we see. The re
liglcus mystic, the practical scientists,
‘the sears oi all ages are coming into
agreement. Thele can he no conflict
in the truth.

Cllristiuuila' is a religion of the
spirit. it is the spirit or righteous
mess, it is truth. It is love. It is the
spirit of Jesus, eternal, before the
loundatlons or the world, With pen

accuracy Jesus Said:
“Bcfure Ablrhaln was, 1 am."

And the spirit of Christ is tlli. spirit
of God. Again with perfect scientific
accuracy we may repeat; “Before the
mountains were brought forth, or ever
thou hadst formed the earth and the
world, even from everlasting 'to ever-
lasting thou art God."

The Anllilallt Lilo

Beyond the electrons and protons
and the invincible rays that flood the
universe just discovered by Dr. Millie
kan, is the power and the energy
which expresses itself through the in
finite procession of material events
onward and upward to the human
mind; to the mind becoming conscious
and mastertul; to 'Lhe mind becoming

at Newton, a Plato, an Angelo, a Phi—l

dias; to the mind and heart becoming
Jesus, central in world civilizations.
Jesus who gathered together in him-
sell ‘ihe principles of freedom and
truth and righteousness, which make
the abundant life.

So far as the material universe is
concerned, quoting ifeyserliug, "When
chaos becomes cosmos there IS noth-
ing beyond it; but the idea of truth is
a propelling force; it points us on-
ward. The last word of nature, its
testament as it were, is the formula
which opens higher worlds to the spire

_, The truth shall make free. And
there arises in many a mind the
wonder expressed by Kant; “Two
things excite me with wonder, the
starry heavens above and the sense of
duty within.” Kant might have added
beauty and all other things lovely and
of good report that together make men
capable of achieving the richness or
the abundant life.

in his own way the psalmist states
it; “When 1 consider the heavens. the
work of Thy fingers, the moon and the
stars. what is man that Thou art
mindful of him . Thou hast given
him. dominion.” Dominion is the word
of the psalmist for the abundant life.

ture of thing leads everywhere to pre-
cisely that which the recognition or
the prophets and sages has anticipat-
ed."

God grows into human lite, and man
grows into consciousness of God as
the processes of creation go on. Again
and again the sages have anticipated
the findings of science. The scient-
ists today are proving that spirit is
the abiding reality. The truth is the
truth however one finds it, And in the
end, nothing but the truth will en-
dure.

We are compelled to believe that
dominion, a ruling ordering power, is
predicated or prophesied in the cosmic
spir Just as We are compelled‘ to
believe that the abundant life as pro-
claimed by Jesus was prophesied in
the cosmic spirit. And this abounding

ind achieving power is a moral pow—l

er. It is inspired by the truth, God.
And this spirit ol God is projecting its
into the universe, into the heart
or man, growing all the while; reach-
ing beyond the material order toward
ideal ends wherein are included all
moral, ethical and spiritual values.
William James old; ”The very Cxist~
enco of the invisible world may de-
pend on our ‘pnuse to it. God bim-
self may draw value and increase from
our fidelity. "In fact," he concludes,
il‘ lite is not a real tight in which
something is eternally gained lor the
universe by success, it IS no better
than a game oi private theatrical:
item which one may withdraw at
Will”

The two things come together. This
mutual emergence between God and

‘ a being looking up to him means per-

solidlity.

Fersonality is a vital part of the

 

creative process. it is open to dem—
onstration for more conclusively than

matter. ltasscr -its r guts ovcrmat-
tor. it is under all, over all, thlougll

tcrs now what name" we give it. We
name it God; God in tune becoming to
us through Ch 'st, the everlasting
Father. We may not venture to at-
tempt to define the personality of
‘God. We shall need first to define our
own. That remains a niystcry and so
will remain.
tied _ of round by Search

Cardinal Newman, we are told, was

wont to say that the greatest dltllcultv
of faith was to believe in God. Newr
man Wasn't by any means the first to
’face this dilliculty. We go back to
Job and find this question: "Canst
thou by searching find out Godl" And
]the answer then, as of all time, is the
same. He is not to be found by search-
ing.
l Lord Charuwood in his recent book
;ou st. John touches the vital point or
‘tlle question. “Definite, abstract, in-
formation that God has been discover-
ed would be as useless a piece of his
yforlllzttion as we could possess. Coin—
placent acceptance of such a pro
‘nouncement would be worse than use
less. The Conviction that Cod is, must
nl-ter all, be based on prolouud
:actiou of awe and love." God must al-
wnvs be the demonstration or our own
experience.

But there is a way to find him. The
French scientist Fahre answered the
‘qucs‘tion when asked it be believed in
‘God. ' , I don't believe in him. I
'see hlm, I know him. He is in my
daily experience."

1 Paul Elmer Moore puts it this way
,"Il Christianity bas any meaning, it
means that the knowledge or God, cul-
minating in love, was brought to us
‘by the incarnation." It was brought in
’tllat special epochal moment when
the Word became Jesus and dwelt

God Grows In Us
The incarnation of Jesus was trails-
‘celluant in its glory, unamlmachdble;
but it was not unique; for the mystery
‘of the incarnation goes on lorever, in
you, in me, in mankind. God, the
lubrd, grows in us, beeamee more
alive in us, more active in us, as our
jlnlllds gradually expand to receive
Imore and more of him. in the hegiu-
‘ntng, God. But today; more of God;
and tomorrow; still more of God: and
so on through all endless succession
of tomorrows, toward it progressive
‘realization of the spirit of God as life
and love and truth.
l The scientists of yesterday and to-
day, some of them, see and accept as
valid only physical things as repre-
senta‘tive of the cosmic energy. John
saw something more, something great-
er, John saw with a host or prophets
'and seers and philosophers, the spirit
of God. as grace and truth, coming into
‘Iection in the world; saw Jesus the
supreme realization of God's personab
ity, brought into the world to empha—
size that fact and to awake to action
the spirit of God in the souls of men.
Jesus, the Word made flesh, gathers
into one unmatched synthesis the
tonalities of personality that are God.

Cannot: Explain God

There must be an incarnation in
some degree in us before We recognize
God Only like knows like. Only the
spi t of God in us can know him, in
whom we live and move and have our
being. Christianity is life in action.
in a personal world, under the inspir—
action of the personal Jesus Christ.

I know God is here. He is here
now. If GOd is love, if he is truth, it
he is life, he is here. If he is What
,Jesus claimed him to be; if Jesus said
truly, “1 and my father are one," then
if We have any inspiration from the
llife of Jesus we have the same moot
10‘ God that Jesus had; not in degree
perhaps, but in kind. We do not e
plain the sun. We live in its life {:in
,ing power. Nor do we explain God.
lVe live in the radiance DY his spirit.

Christianity is tho religion of
the .lbundaut Life. Note what
Jesus Said: “I Come that they

might have it mo e abundantly.
(‘lll'i unity is a life, It is not What
we believe; not our creeds; not merely
our religion. Christlauit is the spirit
of Christ in us. It is what we ARE,
il' wo live under the ill. nation of
Jesus, and also who: we are capable
of becoming. The abundant his is
the expanding, creative word, tllC
cosmic eucl's l, pcl'sonnlizing itself in
us. A more abundant life is a. fuller
realization in us or the spirit of freer
dolu, creative power and dominion.
Science and Christianity arc in agree-
ment. The question or terminology
as between the two is unimportant

Jesus didn't know about the Coper-
nican system of the universe. He
didn't know about the ﬁndings of moth
ern science, He didn't know about
the language of science. They all
come after him. But even so be
transcends them all. He encomr
passes all of them by telling men to
love their neighbors as they love
themselves. He replaces the com-
mon law of commandment by the
spirit of love and fellowship and good-
will within. Jesus understood the
laws of being and gave them expres-
sion through his life, living them
out in tbe presence of men who did
not in any adequate wnv understand
them. Even we today, after nineteen
hundred years, hold them as \\'r)llder~
lul in their divine beauty. but are not
yet ready to accept them practically
in solving the problems of our sorely
distressed world. Yet every one of
them is at once Christian and scien-
tiﬁc. They cannot. will not fail us,

We Do Not Accept Truth.
Christ spoke; his Words are truth.
But these words would he true it
Christ had not spoken them. They
would be true if Christ had never
lived. But only now, after centuries,
is the mind of man at the point Where
he is beginning to recognize their eter-
nal validity. Yet we set them aside
as outside the currents of practical
life, as outside the range of politics,
business and governmental affairs.
Men still [all back on the idea that the
words of Jesus are the Words of a
dreamer, of an impractical Galilean
peasant, soft, weak, sentimental. By
a vast majority we do not even glimpse
the great fact that they are the heart
of truth and reality. They must enter
practical life in some degree, if in any
degree life is to be a success. There
is nothing more profound in human

thought than the words of Jesus.
There is no break in the progression
of universal life from that yesterday
of all the ages to this today of our
common life. The beginning touches
today. The hand of God reaches out
to touch the band of man today. “have
one another as I have loved you."
This is wisdom for the wisest. it is
also wisdom for little children. it is

pure science in its ﬁnal meaning.

Jesus did not know any psychology
in its technical sense as we know it,
but he given enough material in what
we call the Sermon on the Mount to
keep psychologists busy ror all time
to come,

if the scientists interpret the uni-
verse arigbt, there is a moral order
in it. That is. there is something
that proceeds toward harmony, mutual
adjustment, symmetry, ﬁnally resulte
ing in cosmos. In the human world
it is the same; something that chal-
lenges to social order, to good will,
to cooper n and mutual understand
ing; something also that would reject
hate and prejudice and selﬁshness and
mutual uncncern. The scientists rec
port the moral order of the physical
universe in terms of their own choos-
ing. Jesus reports to us in his own
way the moral order in the spiritual
universe. He reveals the way of the
abundant life, There is no conflict
between the scientist and Jesus. They
go forward together, now, just as in
spirit they have been together through
the ages.

Christianity is it religion ni life and
action, a religion of work and creative
achievement. It must be so it it is to
claim the allegiance or all mankind.
The whole program is stated in the
words 01‘ Jesus: "My father workctli
hitherto and i work," We must divest
ourselves or the idea that these words
are the words or a dreamer and a
mystic. They state a scientiﬁc truth
in the terminology of the spirit. They

in the simplieiues of everyday living.
They apply in the giving of a cup of
cold water, in helpful service on the
roadside, in the home, in unselﬁsh ser-
vice of any kind anywhere.

There is nothing static in the prin-
ciples Jcsus gave to the multitude.
The are a challenge to action, to a
revision and reorganization of the
ideals and purposes that move men.

Usi- ls the Test of Principles.

Jesus goes into the crowd and gives
cheer and comfort and blessing. The
multiplication table is valuable onl)’
in straightening cut and calculating
our accounts. The principles at Jesus
are only valuable to us and the World
as they help us to straighten out our
accounts with life. They D0 work,
but it is for us to put them to work if
we wish to see their creative results.
They are the only principles in fact
that will work toward permanency
and stability in human affairs and re-
lationships.

Shall We accept them as true and
try to bring them into further realiza-
tion by some method of attention and
education? 0r shall we continue on
our slow and unreflccting way of trial
and error ‘until in the long last they
will vindicate themselves and ﬁnd
their one place in world civilization?

Christianity is the personal elements,
the spiritual elements, the eternal
elements that inhere in the universe
brought into action. They were there
in. the beginning, They emerged in due
time as the world has emergedﬁhut
supremely so in the life and the words
of Jesus. ,

Christianity is the nail crsill religion.
It is based on What is in the heart. It
validates the urge for righteousness,
for truth, for love, for the abundant
life. it is of no particular time or
place, race or nation. It is for all
time and for all mankind. 1t reaches
into the heart of things and into the
heart of humanity, into each individual
heart, And so we share in it; we are
partners in the great business of mak-
ing Jesus alive and Christianity 3.
growing and redeeming force in our
world, In the beginning the Word.
And the Word became flesh. in the
beginning, God. God in the inﬁnitely
large; in the inﬁnitely small, closer
than breathing, nearer than hands and
feet. God, shown to us in the Christ,
is growlng‘greater as the world goes
on its endless way. God—

“Whose dwelling is the light of set-
ting suns,

And the round ocean and the living
air,

And the blue sky, and the mind of
man;

A motion and a spirit that impel:

All thinking beings, all objects of all
thoughts,

And rolls through all things."

BELOVED: In our endless search
for scientiﬁc knowledge in the physi»
cal world We do not go unrewarded.
New worlds, new systems continue to
appear. But—We know only in part.
The universe is too great for our pres-
ent comprehension. But we can have.
and do have a speaking acquaintance
with it. it is a friendly, reliable uni<
verse. The same God sustains it here,
and in the realms beyond the stars.

And so, like the scientists, our
search for God does not go unreward-
ed. But our faith in God, our know-
ledge of him, must come through the
demonstration of bis qualities in our
daily experiences. God is truth and
goodness, love and beauty, righteous-
ness and power. God reaches out
from the inﬁnite, touches the soul of
man. His qualities move in us. God
claims kinship with us and We under-
stand. Yes, truly, “In Him we live,
and move, and have our being.”
