Conch Sanderson uns Good'diuteriul
From Which to Mom Another
Good Football Eleven.

coach Arie M. Sanderson, Penn Col~
lege football coach, does not need to
worry about seasoned material [or the

, game against Grinncll next Saturday.
Twenty veterans form the nucleus of
the 192s eleven Sanderson has been
building since Sept. 7. Penn-s record
last year is an imposing one and the
Quakers expect to make a greater rec-
ord the next two months.

Quire, captain, is one of the likeiiest
ends'iu the Iowa conference and heads
the list of veterans. Quire promises to
outshrne other wingmen in the confer-
ence. Van Vorhis, another ‘star, is a
great tackle; unquestionably one of
the best in the circuit.

Coach Sanderson is blessed with a
good forward wall for Greene, Wat-
land. Grily, Larson, M. Cook, c. Cook,
Davis, Specs and Swanson have all
had some experience.

in the backfield, former captain
John naiiety, Muhl, Grookbum, Swim
and Schmittcr are veterans with Dane
iels, A. Larson. Moody and Clancy as
reserve material, all of whom have
played‘lhe game before.

President Main Explains Purpose
Of New Department Of Personnel

Ey Pres. J. H. T. Main

Grinneli college has recently one
nounccd a grit from the i. c, Penney
foundation for the purpose of creating
a Department of Personnel or Voca-
tinanl Guidance. The oriiciai organb
cation of such a department will be
something entirely new among the
colleges of iowa. it wii bc a pioneer-
enterprise or very great significance.
This gift is an indication or a grow-
ing conviction among business men
that too many graduates are without
any conception of their best possibili—
ties for an achi'cving career. The
business men in the J. C. Penney
Foundation desire to use Grinnell,
which is distinctly a liberal arts col—
lege, as an experiment station where
it will be possible to study the whole
question of college work as related to
practical life. it is their dc. 'l'e that
we make an effort to reach the
“springs of personality" in our stu—
dents; ‘to help them "know them-
selve, ” and give them a chance to
know tlrcir'special itptitllrles, Grin-
nell had already given considerable
attention to the problem or personal
guidance,

Through its Executive Board Grin<
neil college accepted the proposition
oi the .7. C. Jenney Foundation and

dealing with the problems of young
people and students. and will enter
upon his work with the enthusiasm

l’iullccr Coaches 5]: i Candidates to
strengthen Weir Spots in ,
l‘ltl'w r41 Wall.

The lack of sufficient reserve ma-
teriai is threatening to limit the pow—
er of the Pioneer grid team. Faced
with this dangerous problem, the
coaching ior-ce has been shiitiug catn-
didates irom positions that are more
or less well taken care of, into some
of the weaker spots in the line and
backfield. The center of the line
seems to be holding the major part or
the coaches attention. There are two
letter rneu for these three positions,
and one reserve.

The transfer of Parks from an end
post to one or the guard berths, and
of Riuefort and McClain to wing pnsic
tions, give accurate testimony as to
conditions, The insertion or the lat-
ter two at the wings gives the line
considerable more weight. With the
forward wail remaining-as it is at the
present, Peterson, center, Weitv and
Seelanri, guards, Martin and Davis,
tackles, and Rineforl and Nibio, ends,
the average poundage is a little lighter
than the line of last year. The re-
turn or Davis lroni New York adds
considerable in the line __oi veteran
tackle material and experience to the
line. Davis is looking good, but
shows the lack of conditioning. No
doubt the workouts of this week will
put him in good shape for the initial
fray at Oskaloosa next Saturday.

The backiieid seems to have inher—
