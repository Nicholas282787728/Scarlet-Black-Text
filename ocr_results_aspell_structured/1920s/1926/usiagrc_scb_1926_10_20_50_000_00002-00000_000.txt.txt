WHAT, N0 PHONES!
Grinnell prides herself on her dormitories. The si
buildings at the men's ball are beautiful in architecture
and in furnishings. They are fireproof, lighted by elec-
tricity, heated by steam, supplied With shower baths and
are planned after the must approved methods of dormis
tory construction. That's all very nice.

We also know at a men’s dormitory at andtl—Iel' educa-
tional institlllion. There (00, the buildings are OI rough
brick with Redford stone trimmings Each room contains
a lavatory with hot and cold runnng Walter, and is {ur-
nished with tables, stu'dy lamps, chairs, chiilonicrs, a
rocker, n bookrack, a throw rug and fully eduibped beds.
Furthermore, each 1'00!“ has it telephone, connected with
the city switch board. ‘

We have no reason to consider our dormitories us do:
Veloped [0 tiny point of absolute perfection. We lid. 5
in mind one of our buildings where the men have to arise
early in the morning in order to obtain warm water tor
shaving, where [lie men must always go to the basement
showers or take ll chance on freezing in the cold Water.

However, those contli 0115 will surely not become per- /

maneht, and we are more immediately concerned with
another matter. More important is the question of talc»
"l phones. Why are ninety Grinnell mell compelled to use
one public telephone? Why does a dormitory nmn have
" to sign away his life to secure the privilege or obtaining
a phvate phone, especially as long as he is willing to
root the hull
with two buildings on each telephone line, as many as
ninety men really use but one 'phone. To‘make matters
more complicated, twenty—live per cent of the ninety men
always desire to use the phone at practically the same
time, To prove the point, try to use one or those ’phones
any evening about 10:15.

EDITORIALS OF THE DAYr

SPOR’I'SMANLIKE AMERI AXIS“.
The essence of sound Americanism is the sportsman-
likc spirit. And the acid test oi our sportsmanship is the
attitude we take toward the thing we call majority rule.
Majority rule is the Cornerstone oi democracy.

Majority rule means simply that we will submit all or
our dilficutlies to unhumpererl investigation and discus
sion, vote on the various ways out that may be proposed,
and then abide by the result at the l'ote‘until lurther in~
vestigzttiou and further discussion hlive changed enough
minds to change the voter

Majority rule is far from perfect, but there is nothing
better in sight to take its place. Hereditary ruling castes
have a habit ot going to seed;
their own power, The hope of humanity lies in :7 (19111007

dictators are poisoned by

racy that knows how 'to administer majority rule in a
spor'tsmnulike manner. /‘

Majority rule plus sportsmanship means ii ccilom for
all

Majority rule plus sportsmanship may mean a tyranny
more sinsiter than the tyranny of kings.

In times past inch have treed themselves train the
tyranny of kings by the unholy method or assassination,
but how shallymen free themselves irom thc hydraheadcd
tyranny or an unsportsmanlikc majority?

Under majority rule, the minority must be sportsman
like and take its medicine when the votes are counted
Otherwise democracy will degenerate into a continuous
riot, But we are likely to overlook the equally impoi .JHL
[act that, under majority rule, the majority is also olilir
gated to be sportsmanlilic And this just what the ma-
jority treqiiently is not.

The hesetting sin or the majority is this: It likes to use
the device of majority rule loi- silencing controversy as
well as for settling contests. It tiles to standardize
opinion.

This spells death to the nation that permits it, tor the[

simple reason that the majority has never taken an ads
Viinced step on its own initiative, but only when it has
been prodded into progress by a minority.

A soilud Americanism will protect its pioneers.

We cannot have peace in America unless the majority
is allowed to control institutions; we cannot have pro-
gress in America unless the mlljun'ty is allowed to create
ideas.

The minority must be sportsmanlike in allowing the
majority to settle contest, . the majority must be sports
manlike in allow 11.: the minority to direct discussion.

This is the spirit or sportsmal'lsbp.

This is the essence of sound Anieriounismr
