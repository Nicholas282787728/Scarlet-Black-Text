Although working with the smallest
squad of men since joining the Pio-
neer coaching force several years ago
Coach Hyland is welding together an
aggregation of gridiron huskles who
should carry Grinnell through a suc-
cessful season. With eight letter men
back at work, and with reserve mater
ial to call on, this year's eleven will
have enough balance and power to be
more than just a threat, in every fray.

Leading the teain this year is cap-
tain Porter Martin at left tackle. Mar—
tin has been hobnobbing it with the
Grange devotees during the summer,
and is hard as nails" although sew
eral pounds beneath his usual playing
weight, Already showing the stuff that
earned him,n berth on most allrcou-
ference selections last year, Martin is
giving all the Pioneer followers ample
reason to expect a great season.

Seeland, a guard on last season's
outfit, is acting as Martin's running
mate at the other tackle position The
lndpendence boy is well up in the
beefy class this year, and carries his
weight with plenty of sneer]. Having
earned a name for himself last year
as one of the hardest hitting linemen
in the conference, seeland is out to
settle himself more securely in the
eyes of the enemy as a threat on all
occasions.

1(ch at: Qumter

Hyland is experimenting with May
Clam, an able and of the last two sea-
sons, at quarterback. Having had
experience in high school as a signal
caller and ball-toter, Mac shows all
the signs o’f getting first call on the
posl‘ﬁon. But with only two days of
practice, this is by no means definite.

Meeter and Stotts, old time threats,
are cavorting at the two halfback sta-
ﬂons:‘;uld are showing everything that
can be' expected at this time of year.
Swlts is handling the pants in the
same able manner that he showed last
season.

Niblo is back at his old wing pos—
ition, and seems to be showing all the
stuff he had last year, along with a
fresh supply of new tricks. Nibs is
bigger than ever, and with his usual
amount of god fortune should stay
well out ahead of the other end candi-
dates.

Ted Peterson, husky center, is back
at the position he deserted last year
for a berth one step nearer the side
lines, and is using a little excess
weight ‘lo a good advantage over the
other center aspirants. Ted should
"come throng " this year in great
style. If things go well, he will fill a
mat hole in the Pioneer forward

all.

The veterans on the squad are re-
eiving plenty of stiff competition
runs a capable group of prep team
_raduatcs and reserves. The backfield
andidates. in particular, are making
~trenuous efforts to dislodge the so-
alled “ﬁxtures,”

alohain Doing Kicking

At fullback two unlettered men are
ighting it out. Rincfort, of track
ame, is using his speed and weight,
long with plenty of ability to a good
tdvantagc at that position, but may
ake care of one of the ends. The oth~
r candidate, HughMcLain, a reserve
ack of last year, has enough ability
nd physical requirements to place

FUUH ﬂHANGES MADE
IN 132EB_HII] RULES

Rules committee lLtkes Only One
Ma r Cliauge for was Code: ruse-
ing ltule Brings Comment.

 

 

Four impul‘tant changes in the play
in; code of football rules for 1926
were adopted by the Rules Committee
last March, The changes made are
pl’ubﬂbly more drastic than those
adopted at any of the annual meetings
during the last ﬁve years

A new Eul'wald pass rule States thllL
a team which makes an uncompleted
forward pass all the second or third
downs Will be penalized ﬁve yards.
The main intent of the rule is to curb
the Wholesale passing employed by
loslng teams in the final miuules of
play.

Under anuLher new rule, the team
having the safety scored upon lL must
put the ball in play by kicking on the
first down from its twenty-yard line,
the opposing team lining up on the
thirty-yard line. The idea is to elim-
mate the Safety as a. method of stall-
ing. ‘

A third change involves the recov-
ery of balls that have rolled outside
the actual playing territory. Under the
new ruling, a ball is dead Whlch
crosses either side line, and the team
which touched it last, is awarded the
ball. Thus the dangerous scrambling
fur balls which have rolled mltsltle
will be eliminated.

The other Change stdtes that no
players who have run out of bounds
Will be eligible to recover zt fumble
on kickoff, or on a free kick after a
fall" Catch. The rule is aimed at Illa)”
ers who intentionally run out of
bounds to avoid Contact with members
on the receiving line.

The forward pass rule is the only
one of the four which is receiving
much pro and con comment. Some of
the coaches favor the new rule and
are of the opinion that ll. will Speed
up the game, While others think that
the rule Wlll seriously affect the scol'r
lug power of the teams, It remains to
be seen Whether the new rule will be
successful or not in lilc'roulmg
chance scoring In the last few minutes
01' play,

Bookstore Will Open

The college bookstore, which sells
llll college tent books, will open for
business Monday. "he store will be
in charge ol Herold Hicks, ’27 who
will he a stcd by Eugene Egan, '29

done in tllc‘ past. The receipts, if kept
and turned in when called for, will en-

“EVERY l‘l/lAN IN ATHLETICS” IS

VISION

OF NEW ATHLETIC HEAD

 

‘ say

Traiik L. l-ioycs

“To get. every man in some athletic
activity that he likes, where he can
expend his surplus energy and at the
same time build up his physical unil-
being" is the basis which Professor
Frank L. Hayes, Gl‘illllell’s neiv dlr‘
color of physlcnl education and nth»
letics, states as his policy for intra-
inural athletics .tt thnncll. "I would
like to see Grinnell be the first collage
in the country to have every- man slu—
deiit enrolled in some fol-iii of plivsical
exercises, I hellevﬁ we have an ideal
Situation lit Gl'lnuell for the (leveled
inent ol intramural athletics and
sports. 1 am very anxious to orr'ln-
izc the athletic honor fraternity, Delta
sigma Phi, which is nothing more than
an efficiency lost for athletes, but
which is going strong in iii-any col-
leges and universities."

Speaking of CDlI"SeS in physical od-

u tum and coaching professor lluyos
» “My hope is that within a short
time we ulll be in a po tion to ln~
mate and put into opcration a pr
gram which '11 lead to a major in-
cluding physical education, school
health, and coaching. We do not
want to fit men to go out just as
coachesiwe want them to be \velle
trained teachers in the field of phy
ical education and school health as
well. We must equip them with-an
education which will prepare them for
the position in education and in the
community which they will occupy. It
is not necessarily the star athlete who
makes the best coach. The man who is
physically, morally, and mentally fit is
the one sought by most school men.
Nor is it absolutely necessary that a
man be an athlete to take such a
course. School administrators are
looking for men who can head up a
physical education program. They all
say it is easy to find a coach, but hard
to find the man who has the necessary
all-around training."

“Not along vigor, but social intellie
gence, is brought out in competitive
sport to a degree not equalled elser
where," M .lliiyes declares. “Nothing
is more important than that a boy
should learn, during the formative
years of his life, to control and com-
mimtl his own powers, to focus them
upon a single end, to mobilize them
quickly and completely, and yet to do
so with a chivalrous regard for the
rights of others and the rules of the
game. It is possible to preach this in
the classroom or church, but it is
vitill and imperative that he should
have something like a laboratory
training in carrying out these pre—
cepts. Competit' e sport furnishes
such a laboratory.

First Impressions

 

 

Yesterday afternoon a Scarlet and
Black reporter strolled across the
campus, asking each freshman he met
for his or her first impression of Grin-
nell. This what he learned:

 

Hospital Inshrance Sill
To Students At Low Hate

The possibility of illness away from
home and the need of skilled care
while sick, should make every student
in Srinnell college thankful that the
college has arrangements by which.
for a surprisingly small fee, each stu-
dent may be assured of excellent care
in a fine up-to-the-minutc hospital.
Student hospital insurance, providing
as much as three weeks board, room
and nursing, any time during the
school year, is obtainable for only five
dollars.

Many Students in the past have
Droven this to be an economical and,
in fact, a. proﬁtable investment. Many
cases might be cited, in which the stue
dent has received hospital care which
at regular rates, Would have cost ‘lhem
{Tom $10.00 up to $85.00.

The parents of students always feel
much more comfortable about them if
they know adequate care is certain in
case of illness, which is the greatest
worry of fathers and mothers when
their children are away at school.

some colleges over the country
are requiring hospital fees of each
student. These fees in other schools
are interesting when compared to
those in force here.

Prep Srilslers To Start
Practice Early Ill Weak

The date for the first freshman root
ball practice hasnot been set but it is
likely that coache’s‘ Lake and Morris
will issue some equipment today,
practice starting Monday or Tuesday.

Duke, famous Pioneer linesman and
all-Missouri Valley selection, had
charge of the yearlings last year,
turning out a well coached team, Mor.
ris, who graduated Irom Grinnell last
spring, played three years of varsity
football and knows the Hyland style
of play. Athletic Director Hayes may
also assist Duke and Morris, Duke al-
ternating with Hayes in working with
the varsity souad.

The strength of the prep material
is unknown but many high school
stars are enrolled. Hill-per, Messeng-
er, Meyers, Van Treese, Wilhelm,
Gustatson, Hart, Phelps, Sharnborg,
Kennedy, Winter. Brown and Standr
ard are some of the outstanding high
school athletes expected to register.

Brute Strength Meets Trickery
When Preps Combat Sophbmores

It's every man for himself some
night soon when blood thirsty freshe
ies, after a week of goading. with re-
venge in their hearts and ropes ready
in their hands, go on the war path,
Every sophomore who has locked
cross»eyed at a prep will find himself
hunted and chased by bands or fr hr
men all night, only to meet ignullliu»
ious defeat when daylight comes. It's
a cruel tune for/sophomores; and a
fine one for preps

The affair is the annual class scrap.
Sophomores leave for out of the
way places to make their beds with
ireshics in hot pursuit bent on captur-
ings, tying up, and subjecting to tor—

Members of the freshman class who
intend to go into activities outside
their regular class work will find plen-
ty of opportunity to do so in the val-r
ious organizations active on the cam-
pus. Athletics will claim the biggest
share of attention for the next few
months. Both men and women will
find plenty of activity along this line,
Freshman football is open to first,
year men, with cross—country running,
work toward the physical training
credit, and the tennis courts offering
enough to keep anyone busy. The
Grlhnell Golf club has a good course
which college students can arrange to
use. Women will be offered a variety
of fall sports including golf, tennis,
hockey, hiking and gym work.

Musically inclined freshmen will
have a great deal of opportunity to ex-
ercise their talents. Both the men's '
glee club and the girls' glee club hold
try outs and election shortly after the
beginning of school and several fresh-
men usually find their way into these
organizations. The college 'bfmd, re—
organized last year into one of the
most popular organizations on the
campus, wul welcome any one who
cares to try- out. The college orches—
tra offers another opportunity to the
musically talented.

Debuting Popular

The Forensic society sponsors all
debates and speaking contests on the
campus, and the freshman interested
in this line of work will have plel'l‘Ly
of chance to take part in inter-dorm
debates. Intercollegiate debate also‘
presents an opportunity for talented.
men who care to try out for the var- '

Sl‘ty vamp gmah contests offer

work a valuable one.

For the freshman intereste
writing Grinnell offers many oppoi‘
tunlties. Besides the regular courses
there are several publications which .
are open to ambitious first year men
and women. The Scarlet and Black
always adds a few freshmen to its
editorial staff. The Tanager, Grin—
nell's literary magazine is anxious to
have contributions from the new class.

The Malteaser, humorous magazine
published by the Grlnuell chamber of
sigma Delta Chi, depends on the stu-
dents for its copy also.

Freshmen \l’elwmo

The Y. l1 0. A. and the Y. W. 0. AL
always extend a cordial invitation to
freshmen to attend their meetings and
take part in their work. Both “Y’s"
hold meetings through out the year
with programs of speeches and music.
:‘There are numerous organizations
active on the campus which appeal to
the man or woman with special inter—
ests. The Science club is for students
interested in physics, mathematics and
chemistry. The Macy Social Science
club makes a speciality of social re-
lations and international affairs. The
Cosmopolitan club has for its purpose
the promotion of friendship among
students of all nationalities. The
Dramatic club holds try outs every
year to keep its membership filled.
