HE Parker Duot’old point

combines what you-get in
no other point—durability and
ﬂexibility.

This point yields to any style
of writing yet retains its origi-
nal shape. It is guaranteed {or
25 years not. only for mechani-
ml perfection but for wear. ‘

And Parker Dubfold‘s barrel
and cap will not break, though
you drop it a hundred times.
For they are now made of Per-
manite—Parker's non-break-
able material that haswithstood
sucn gruelling tests as a 3,000
foot drop from an aeroplane.

This combinatinnwthe Par-
ker Duofold Point and the
Parker ”Permanite" Barrel and

 

 

 

Cap—makes the world’s great—
est writing instrument.

You cannot get such value in
any other pen, at any price.
