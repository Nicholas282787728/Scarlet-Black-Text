Moran Barnstorming
With Good Success

“Hap" Moran who cavorted under
Grinnell's colors on the football and
basketball fields, has been doing some
barnstorming Work, tossing baskets
for various semi—professional cage
teams throughout the state, since the
Missouri Valley basketball season has
closed.

Moran's first game was playing
with the Charlton Roam-tors in their

Icontest against the powerful Southern

Surety quintet from Des Moines, The
Capitol city outfit whs one of the
best in the state and had established
an excellent record, but the offensive1
strength of the Boomers was too great
and the Southern Surely lost, 31 to 11
was so closely guarded
throughout the contest that he was
able to loop in only three baskets, but
his floor Work was easily the feature
of the contest.

Playing with Grand Junction in the
state independent tournament and
meeting such strong teams as Milford,
Mal-shalltown, and Cascade, Moran
through his expert eye enabled Grunu
Junction to win first honors. "Hap"
garnered forty'vfour baskets and eight
free throws in four games, during this
tournament.
