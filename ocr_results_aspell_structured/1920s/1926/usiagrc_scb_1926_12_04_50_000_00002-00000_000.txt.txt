The seventh annual High School Press association,
sponsored by Grinnell college through Sigma Delta Chi
and Theta Sigma Phi, has been brought to a. snccessinl
close. Since its inauguration, the convention has had
tuo obvious purposes, a reﬁned and subtle iorois oi pub-
licity tor the institution and an ample opportunity ior-
high school papers over the state to be constructively
criticized.

The key note oi the convention is one or competition.
When such elements as front-page make-rip, editorial
column, humor column, best news story are made subjects
ior contest, not only the stniis as whole units are compet-
ing one with the other, hiit this individuals who are at
worn at the various magazines or newspapers. The
recognition is riot individual oi course, but the rcilected
slory or individual work illiimines the iaces and hearts
or the whole stoil. ,

Another rorrn or competition in connection with the

convention manifested itselt last spring. At lows

,, the journalistic chapters ielt the urge tor a press
convention to such a degree that they organized the Gum
and Scroll. to which convention they invited the rest oi
the United States. Conceived as a national organization,
it nevertheless seems to have been limited to Iowa. Their
