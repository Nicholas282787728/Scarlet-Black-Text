IYearling Prospects Point towards
Considerable Good Varsity
Material Next Year.

with two weeks remaining beiore
their clash with the Washington U.
Frosh, the Grinch ﬁrst year grid
team is putting on the aspects of a
rent aggregation. Carrying plenty or
beef in both line and backfield, the
Freshmen have been checking the
varsity attacks in a pleasing manner.
The game petween the Blues and the
Reds this morning gave spectators at
good idea at what they can do.

No contain has been elected as yet.
The competition tor this post is wide
open this year. with a wide l'ange'uf
candidates to be chosen from, as the
largest and most capable squad to he
seen on Freshman field in several
years is reporting to Coach Hayes
daily. .

Among the men who are making the
best impressions as hall toters are
several who are allvstate selection.
Liedtlte, from Rock Island, 111,, and
who covorts quite eapnhly at a hack—
iield hertb, was the recipient oi this
rather signal honor in lilinois last
year. Rose, Orient, a bushy who tips
the scales at a little in excess of 180.
is playing a fine game at tullhack.
His passing has hecn especially good
and several times he he been on the
tossing end oi passes which scored
on the varsity.

Other hackiield aspirants who show
more than promise are Carr, Pooeioy.
a halibach, Carr has the reputation
oi being one or the hardest hitting men
on the souad. On one occasion this
lad, who weighs in the neighborhood
of 175 pounds, crashed the varsity ior-
ward wall for a gain of almost halt
the length of the iield on a score oi
plunges. hiaytum, Pilullilla, a hack-
who capable of trotting a hundred
yards in a little over ten seconds, is
melting a nice impression on ‘llle
coaches. McIntyre, Audubon, has the
stnif that marks him as one or the
leading candidates for the signal call.
in addition, this youngster

Another Meeter is on the Frost:
squad. Butch's younger brother Law-
i'ance is doing things on this year‘s
yearling outfit which the older bro:
ther didn’t do in his prep days. Weigh—
in; over 175 pounds, young leeeter
runs, passes and kicks with equal.
ability and this ability is not mediocre. 1

Line men who will bear watching
are headed by Ed Rice, lending center,
candidate. Rice hails from Idiot.
Mich, and was an all-state man Irom
the Wolverine state,

Gustaison, Elgin, 111.;
hell, and Sharnmrg, Bellevue, are all
ends at no mean ability. There is no
beef lost on the wings oi the prep
outﬁt, with each of these men carry-
ing 170 pounds or more.

'l'uckle nominees are Lair, Des,
lloines, a tormer Drake prep star, who ;
shows more ability every day; Fax-i
ish, Grinnell high school star; Kleinvi
ielter, Conrad, who is considered one
of the leading tnchlc prospects; and.
Phelps. West Liberty.

Rees, Anamosa, 2-10 pound guard, is
proving a “big help” in that position.
Rees has the prospects ct developing?
into a player of ability, as he handles;
himself much hotter than do most men l
of his size. Barnes. Shenandoah. al-
though one 01 the lightest men on the:
team, is holding down a guard her-tn,
and trom all reports has a pretty firm
hold on it.

Other members of the sound who
desire special mention are Do Long.

Editor.
Scarlet and Black.

I want to comment on your editorial
01 a. week or so ago suggesting that
the‘ name or the “Scarlet & Black"

he changed on the gl ountl that it lines-
lit mean anything

It does mean something to the old
grads who have known the Scarlet &
Black for 25 years. It is part of the
tradition of Grlnllell and as long as
the colors oi Griilnell remain Scarlet
and Black, I cannot see any ground
for your statement that the name
doesn't mean anything.

Therefore I hope your movement
,worhing toward a change in the name
of the paper will fail,

Yours truly,
D K. Campbell.
