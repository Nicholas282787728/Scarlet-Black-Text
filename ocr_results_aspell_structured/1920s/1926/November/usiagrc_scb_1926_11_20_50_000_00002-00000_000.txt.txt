Jonathan Swift once oficretl a “Modest Proposal" lot
the relief of poiei iii irelaiid in which he suggested that
young children might readily be cured and sold as hams
in order to solve the monetary difficulties of the poor,
Despite the tlrastic need for funds to complete the Grmr
nell endowment and thus drlre the pinch Ogre nu- -, no
such proposal has as yet been presented to college author
ities.

Nor is it hltely such a proposition will he brought loin
ward in this time of need for the simple reason that
cannibalism in its grossest forms has largely disappeared
Yet. an intelligent obscrrcr has suggested to the Scarlet
and Black that a certain form of cannihalism, Baal: can-
nihahsm, is commendable and has or may have a direct
bearing an the Grinnell endowment.

A Boolg cannibal it is learned. is an omnivorous read-
er - person in whom the will to browse has run r
pant. The Book Cannibal recognizes Bacon’s distinction
between those volumes to he tasted and those to he chew .
ed and digested, hat is primarily interested in (lei‘l‘t‘liillltlg
the mental stomach for edible hooks.

But the Book Cannibal has been sorely discoml’itell
by his Gl'lllnell surroundings. He has discovered the
to h on o frustrated on all sides through lacic of lihi ry
facilities.

P sting about for a hullltlml to the problem of the
omnivorous reader and the hundred of potential lltei‘zlr
ature enthusiasts, authorities in leading universities and
colleges over the United states have hit i‘ipoii a happy
thought. a browsing room in the library.

Carried to fruition at Harvard, the idea has develop.
ed into the Farnsworth room of Widener lihr dedicat-
ed to the browsing instinct or students. There, amul
perfect peace and quiet, undergraduates niay . t in easy
chairs with such homelike surroundings as floo lamps,
rugs, and long shelves of new hoolrs, while they indulge
the will to browse,

it has been suggested through these columns that
solution of Grim-tell endowment difficulties lies in the

number and merit of special funds established. For the
development ot hoolt cannibalism among students, than,
and as a worthy slleclitl»plll'posc fund for the endowment.

Once upon a time there was a college editor. He

Jiad an oitice on the campus where he gave assignments,

cditcd copy, and received complaints.

As at most institutions there was a collection or
armchair philosophers. sometimes ther
around to his "l‘elliletlous" waving their aims and foam
ms at the mouth, others would send their l ciids around
to tell him they were but under the collar; sometimes be»
cause an article didn’t get in, and other times because one
did. '

All the organi actions on the college 'l'nrtl thought
the school paper was a publicity haiidbill. “hey sent

him editorials and sermons about themselves to put on the

front page and expected him to hill good news stories [0‘

malte room for their publlci stunts, They would write

, . . i
reams of rot in pen and lull and thou swear if there

were .tny' mistakes in spelling, etc,
bring in a wastehaslcctful of grammatical errors and disc
tortetl facts and then make the air blue when their litera—
ture appeared in black and \l‘llllu.

The editor was deformed. He had a conscience.
Some of these clay saints, silpei-inen, and cmhrionic gen-
iuses were getting his ”goat.” He began pr‘
and measuring the depth of the river.

One day he was reading over some philosophies of
Abraham Lincoln, The lines: “You can fool all of the
people some of the time, some of the people all of the
time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time,"
suggested a parallel.

"You can please all of the people some of the time,
and some of the people all or the time, but yuu can't sat-
isfy all of the people all at the time.“

After this, the editor barricaded the windows of his

office. had a steel bolt put in the door, bought himself a'

saiveﬂroff shotgun and lived happily ever df’Ler.

To the Editor of the Scnrlct [c Illaclt
Sit:

In a recent editorial the Y, \I C. A,
was prupcrl commended [or its en.
e in taking steps to have the
open on evenings at the end
of the week. No fault can bc iouiid
\iilli the ‘1 nor with the editor il.But
the question asks itself what is the
reason that the Y has had to take
this matter lip when there are al-
i-catly three or four authorized in-
struiiieiits of self—government on the
campus

The Strident Council, the \V. s. G
L., and the Senate all struggled lm-
ior and obtained constitutional ii
