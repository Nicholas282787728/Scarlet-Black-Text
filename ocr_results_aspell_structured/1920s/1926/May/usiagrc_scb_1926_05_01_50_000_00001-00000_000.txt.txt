MUST JUSTIFY ‘EDUCATION’

Diploma 15 Not «lucllilion Iilli’
IbllhEl' The Things Which
Relulli \\ iili One.

”The primary purpose of going [0
college is to get something that will
justify the name ‘educlltiou"' ‘iid
President Main in his address at sen—
lor chapel Friday morning. ”A good
many of us shy at the word ‘educfl-
tian.‘ We didn’t want to be called
sharks, or grinds. Hence we go
through college hitting on one cylinder
and setting only a small proportion
of what we might get." This is true
of the whole college and university
world. President Main declared. We
fail to get an understanding and a
better appreciation oi the reality of
the unseen.

Education Isn’t Mechanics

We talk about a job. as the result or
a college education, or a better social
standing, but the average student does
not admit that he is in college for a
better appreciation of the unseen.
”The world in which we live doesn’t
talk in such terms; it doesnt under-
stand such language. Yet it is an
surd to talk about an education in the
terms of mechanics, money and jobs.
If_ that is all we get. it islrt worth very
much. Of course that has its place.
I haven't mentioned these things to
throw them out, but they do not have
the place of emphasis they are re-
ceiving. I want your college eduear
tlon to mean a larger mind, and some
sympathetic understanding of life’s
problems."

President Main said it would he pos—
sible by using grades to make a graph
of four years of. college live, but,
"education must mean something
over and above anything and every-
thing seen in a diagram, however com—
plete it may seem. You are going to
forget diagrams, and much that is in
books. That is of no consequence.
When you have forgotten the whole,
or the better part of these things, the
thing that remains is your education.

Must Touch the Outside

"Have we appreciated the august
fact that music is a universal labia
uagel Have we learned the universal
appeal and challenge of great litelu
attire? Have we learned some of the
great facts ot life? Have we a finer
appreciation of this wonderful, every.
day world of ours? Have we an ac—
curate appreciation and an accurate
knowledge of environment?

"We in college must touch the out—
side, the general, the universal, or
we have in some degree failed in the
great business or education."

Grimiell Hits Pioucercd

president Main called upon the sen-
iors as prospective alumni to help in
determining wherein Grinncll has
failed in the ftttelnpt‘tu develop dome
ocracy; to develop community lite as
a basis of fellowship and good will; to
develop a spirit of cooperation, freer
dolu and universal spirit by voluntary
obligations, and the principle or:
self-government. ‘

“In all of these lines, Grinnell has
been among the pioneers. All of these
things have to do with the spiritual
side of lifeAillat which remains when
things are forgotten'and that is edu-
cation. College niust hltve as a pri—
mary aim, some philosophy of life. 1
want you to believe Grinncll is heads
ed in the right direction.”

The preliminaries in both hurdles

in all heats were not pushed and
seemed to be saving themselves for
the alter-noon races. The track was
