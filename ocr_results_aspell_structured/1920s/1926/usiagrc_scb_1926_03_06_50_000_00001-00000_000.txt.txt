Alllliitinllce itcoiiircluciit.

Miss Luella J. Read, Dean of Wo-
men returned Thllrsday morning from
_a two week trip to Washington, \lcw
’York and Chicago. At iiiashiiigton,
Miss Read attended the conference of
the National Association of Deans of
Women, Representatives from about
eight hundred institutions wcrc in Mr
tendance.

In reporting the coiiicrence, Miss
head said that among the most interv
csting features discussed were the
various methods of colleg admits
tancc, wether by examination, reconc
niendatioii, intelligence tests or per-
sonal inteivicw iii add' on to high
school credits. A survey and statis-
tical reports along ‘tli line were prc-
sented,

Discuss Intelligence Tests

Miss Read mentioned particularly
several of the conference speakers.
Dean Hal -cs of Columbia College
discussed intelligence tests and em»
phasizcd the responsibility of the col-
lege to the student. He stated that

- fact that the college admits
a student plaocs’upoii it every l'éspuu—
sibili - for his welfare, The dismissal
of students casts a reflection llpon the
college itself, Miss Read commented
upon the fact that it is exactly this
attitude which is taken by Gl'innellilr
contrast to other colleges who pride
themselves on the number of students
dismissed,

New developments in the college
curriculum, studied by Professor
Richardson of Dartmouth in both the
United states and Europe were con-
trasted by him, In Europe, higher
education has as its purpose the prey
paration of a mail for a profession or
for membership iii the group of dis-
tinct intellectuals The American 0017
loge has a tremendous opportunity of
wholly transforming the educational
idea, preparing its graduates as it
does for business and life in general.

The American college educauon has
the ability to transform thc mechanr
ical pursuits into something worth
while and to make the hours of leisure
time rich.

Norwegians C 20 System

Mrs. Skonhott, the secretary of the
Norwegian Federation (of university
women. put forth criticism of the al.-
titude developed in the student by the
American system oi wo ing for crcd-
its and points in placo of offering the
.rcal value of the work itself as an ill-
ccntive.

Miss Read endorsed favorably the
suggestion of this speaker that each
country make out a list oi books
which foreigners could read and
which would give the best conception
of the educational system of that
country to those interested. Thi
would bc wonderfully worth while in

guarding against misrepresentation oi ,

the type which is damaging to the

ideals of education.

Dressed in the stately robes of the
romantic past, Miss Thompson brings
the mediacval spirit to her audience,

Unlimited Possibilities In Corn
Products Says Grinnell Chemist

Fond value of it number of Corn prey
ducts is highly praised by Prof. L. P.
Sherman, head ol' the department OI
chemistry at Gl‘iuuell college. Chums
lsts have always recognized the ill—
sll’msic Worth of Cum products, he
says, (lull [lll'nllli‘s will be materially
aided if the public is educated to that
point of View.

“I was born and raised on B. New
England fitnn where all our eol'n was
stored away for winter food. Now
there are multiple products into which
can] can he made, Not the least of
these possible products is alcohol.
When an eventual shortage of the
gasoline Supply sends the price 503
ing, it is entirely possible that a fi
Ling substitute may he found in corn
alcohol."

Oz‘lginallty of chemists is unlimited,
says Mr. Sherman, and it is therefore
altogether possible that the process of
making corn alcohol may become so
economical as to make the manufac»
Cure very profitable. For the present
it is not that. the process itself is so
easily, he says, but that the product
used commands such a high price.

glucose is classed as an adulter-allt iii
opposition to the best knowledge ,oi
all chemists, Dl'. Sher-man states. In
the process of digc, iou all starches
are turned to sugar through the .in-
lermcdiate stage of glucose, and it is
therefore preposterous to bclicvc that
glucose is liarintul, That gillcosc is a
pure food product may as well be
recognized by law, he contends, for in
that case sale of glucosc products will
bosubstantially loci-cased and the star
tus of the farmer will be helped.
Even corn cobs can bc used iii the
making of scvcral important products
t cording to thc Gririncll professor.
Furlural, a distillate product made by
cwiiig up cobs undcr prcssurc, is
widely used ill making phonograph
records, sulators, and fountain pens,
Water glass, which llsod in packing, is
another corn cob product. Even
small amounts of sugar can be ob-
tained from colis, but the amounts
made that way are ‘negllglble and
will probably never form a source of
supply, "although you never can tell,"
Professor Shernmn‘ adds, "it they
have to, chemists can make sugar out

 

Under the present pure loud laws

of anything."

Team of Five stars.

a Greatest Game

By P. . Norris, Jr.

Fighting the greatest game of the
entire season, the Pioneers gained an
early lead on the Kansas Aggies last
night, lost it, tied the score as the
final whistle blow, only ‘Lu lose the
breaks and the game by arytwo point
margin, 33 to 31. in a thrilling over-
time period.

'Five men starred for Grinnell, and
to pick one as outstanding would be
to discredit the other four who had
an equal part in playing the greatest
game seen on the local floor in many
years. Captain Wing, showed himself
a real leader he played in his old
tiiiic form in his last game in a Grin-
ilell uniform, stopping everything that
came his way, and directing the whole
team in a manner that would have
been a credit to any Missouri Valley-
captain.

“Hun" ‘chllius 01d Form

“Hap" Moran, also aware that it
was the last time, a Gl'innell crowd
would cheer him, played the some
braiid of basketball that a year ago
made him one of the nlost feared cas-
crs in the conference. Playing the
pivot position, he out-jumped the
rangy chow of the Aggies in nearly
every lip—off, and twice made his op~
poneuts look foolish by dribbling the
entire length of the floor to snag a
neat counter.

And "Dopey" Lamb, who has just
begun to find hiriisclf iii the last two
games, covered the whole floor, in the
midst of things on the offense, and
dropping back at exactly the right
time on defense, in a manner that will
make him a valuable man next year,
He missed but one out of five chances
at free throws, and shot thrcc uncan-
iiy baskets, his ﬁnal ‘conutar from the
writer or the floor tying the score just
as the final gun \vas'fil-ed.

Peterson, Davis Clover

”Sunny" Davis, under Capt VViug’s
dircotiou played a real game at guard.
Many of the Aggie eager-s felt his
strength and weight as he crashed in—
to opponents time after time to grab
Moran's tip-oft. Besides throwing the
Farmers around in the back court he
found time to sneak up and loop three
markers, his final one counting but a.
few seconds before the end of the
overtime period.

“Red" Peterson was all right, He
again demonstrated that he is a
"sweet” basketball player, by his
speed, jumping ability, and basket
eye. probably the fastest man on the
Gl'iunell team, and the most consis-
tent produccd this season. he showed
the soother-hers that it doesn't take
a big man to play basketball.

The Pioneers started off with a
hang. The Aggies were unable to
iatlionl their defense, and led by Capt.
Wing, Griuuell began a scoring s‘pl-ce
that soon resulted in a 9 to 1 load.
There was no let—up in their play, but
the Farmers began to realize thatthis
was no way for a (nibeud team to
be acting, and tightened up with the
result that the scoro was narrowodto
14 to is at the cud of the first stanza.

Pioneers Increase Lent]

Al. the start of the second frame,
Lamb increased the Pioneer's lead
with two free throws but the Aggies
forged ahead with a field goal by Ed»
wards, two free counters by Osborne,
and one by chow, llelore the Scarlet
and black tcam again counted. From
then on the game seersdwed, with the
Aggie§ maintaining a slight ndvdnt»
age, until Lamb brought the crowd to
their foot with his breath taking shot
that knotted the count at 28 all as the
whistle blew.

iii the extra period, the Aggies got
the jump, and baskets by Tebow and
Edwards and a free throw by Byers
gave them a lead that was too great
to overcome. Lamb scored a free
marker, and Davis a field goal as the
game ended.

For the Aggles, layers was the out-
standlng performer, garnerlng five
