“For whilt you are now this minute,

said. ”You have inherited a, good
deal. You lire here with your strength

fact that il. man is in College shows
that there is within him it purpose

Dl‘. Steiner named four things that

declared, “a. man must learn to he

‘Swimming Added to
Men’s Program for
Physical Education

Gl'inucll's new natatorium ll
play a large part in the physical train
ing program thi year. The present
‘plnn is that 1Jlly.mal training for men
!will consist of one hour a neck on
the gun floor and one hour in the
;pool. This can be altered to both
lhours in the pool for men meeting the
,llife snving requirements

‘ The tank will be used on altcrnaie
{days by the men and by the women.
lFor that reason, in order to determ-

 

.ine What days and hours will be most
convenient for the men, \lr. Turner,
who is to have charge of the work in
swimming, is especially anxious to
lhave all freshman and sophomore men
register with him or Mr. Duke as soon
as possible, Mr. Duke‘s P. T, classes
will meet on Monday, Tuesday, Wed-
nesday. Thursday at 10:30 and on
Tuesday at 9:00.

On account of the recent rains,
work on the natatorium is progressing
rather slowly and the pool will prob-
ably not he ready to use for several
weeks. However, the swimming classes
will meet in the gym until the pool is
completed. .

Gl‘innell’s clossscouu‘tl’y Squad has

Coach “Les” Duke's Di‘fl‘tcges are

The schedule is yet incomplete. hut
negotiations are being made with sev-
eral s’chools to open the season with
a meet here October 23. The spl e-

Scarlet and Black a slight edge on the
