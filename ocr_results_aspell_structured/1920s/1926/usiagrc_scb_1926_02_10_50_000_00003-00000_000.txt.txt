Dibble hall added another intramuiu

al athletic cup to her list by breaking

eren in the final two games with Clark
liztll and preventing a three—cornered
tie between Clark, Langen and lelile.‘

The contests of last Saturday proved

to be the most exciting of the entire

series and some excellent basketball
was displayed,

In the first games of the afternoon,
Langan hall, the dark horse of the
tournament came through with two
easy wins m er the boys from Building
One. The Longnn A team won by a
15 to 5 score. Struble posing as “dead

The Two B's trampled over the Smith
B's, winning 18 to 2. Selle, center for
the Langenites, scored 12 points.

while ”\lhitey" Wolfe and “Pinky”
Culier were the offensiie stars. The
13 game was a slow affair, neither team
displaying much basketball ability.
The Three E's triumphed by a 13 to S
score. '

The final games of the day between
Clark and Dibble hall were the chi-
mination at one of the most successful
interdol‘m basketball series ever cons
ducted, The Clark hall boys came
nearly ending the tourney in a three
cornered tie, but the Dibbleites were
not to be denied. Had Five won both
games the situation would have been
different, but the best the Clarksters
could do was to can one game. The
mix between the A teams was prob-
ably the most thrilling game of the
series and closely resembled one ‘of
the hard fought varsity contests, The
outcome was in doubt till the final
whistle, neither team being able to
hold the leJad for any length of time.

Pilocoe illul Sweet Star

When the smoke of the battle had
cleared away, Clark hall was on the
long end of the score, winning 16 to
15. Paseoe, with nine points, starred
for the winners, while Sweet did the
best work for Dibble. The B teams
resumed the conflict and played as
tight a game its the A’s, Close guards
lug by both sides prevented much
scoring and slowed up the game eon-
siderahly, The final count was s to (i

‘in fluol‘ of Dibble. Carlinrt and Nice-

the star tor Clark.

Struble, Building Two's erack [arr

hit the basket consistently accounts
