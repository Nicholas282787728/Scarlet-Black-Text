Grinnell begun the scoring with s

Rudy. Grinnell then opened up with‘
a long range bombardment and alter

by Wulf and Critchet placed the count

Two free throws by Rody and a goal

Fearing in the later part was the only
scoring done by the Pioneers in the

got into action and counted nine points
for the visitors while Woestemeyer
also counted from the ﬁeld. An at—
tempt by Gl'innell to even the count
by long shots during the last few mlnv
