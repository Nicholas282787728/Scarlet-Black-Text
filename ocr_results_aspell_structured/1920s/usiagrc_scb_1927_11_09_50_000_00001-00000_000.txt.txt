EDITOR DAILY IOWAN TALKS

Koop Declares Journalism Is As
Much a Profession As Are
Medicine And Law.

At the iii-st public pledging service
oi the Gl'illnell chapter at Sigma Dele
ta Chi, national journalistic iratci-nity,
Plull Edwards, hlani-icc Ci-abb. Geor c
Moore, Buell liornian, Arthur nisser.
and Deane Starrett were pledged to
the organization in n' special chapel
service Monday inorinng, Theodore
Knop, editor or the DAILY loWAN,
spoke at the pledging scmce. Robert
Bui-liiigaine, president of the Grinnell
chapter, acted as chairman and gave
out the pins to the pledges. ‘

"Journalism today," said Mr. Koop,
“is a protession along with medicine
and law and as such is becoming more
dignitied. The standards oi journal-
ism have been raised until now a lib-
eral education and a thorough ti in.
ing are essential to a journalist."

(‘iuulm‘ Tapers Tllml'm’etl.

As evidence that the standards of
the country newspapers are being rais-
ed the speaker pointed out .the tact
that each year more college trained
men are iound on the stalls or country
newspapers, The superiority oi a
college trained man proves itself both
in technique and in a background from
which to draw news, My. ltoop declar-
ed.

“Experience on a college newspaper
is valuable because college papers are
experimental. They keep abreast of
the times. Mistakes which creep into
the work of an unexperienced college
man may be avoided in later work it
experienced while in school," the
speaker said.

"Not only do 1 believe in journalism
but 1 believe in sigma Delta Chi," de-
clared Mr. Koop, "because it attempts
to raise the ethical standard of joure
nnlism." The stand oi Sigma Delta
Chi against yellow journalism and all
that is opposed to the betterment ot
journalism as a profession was praised
by the speaker,

Burllllgame Traces Chapter Work.

Pioneer Men Hold
Wisconsin 20 to 0

Grinnell Keeps Scoring Down to
772 for Three Quarters In
Game Saturday.

Playing the Wisconsiin university
team fresh hour a close game with
one oi the strongest Big Ten eievens,
Grinnell iorgot her early season de-
lcats and [ought her opponent to a
standstill ior three ouortcrs Saturday,
only to tail victim to two Badger
marches in the last period which
hroisht a 20 to 2 defeat,

Wi onsin licgaii the game with her
shock troops. Alter a march down
the iicld which ended in a touchdown.
tlicsc troops suitcrcd a setback which
called ioi-tli ciglii regulars to hold the
local warriors who had begun to do
things, Captain Davis blocked a punt
which rcllcd O\el‘ the Wisconsin goal
and was recovered b~ Bradley just
alter it had gone outsid ‘ The i-ciei-ee
was called on to decide whether the
play brought a touchdown to Grinuell
or a satcty against the Badgers.

Itrl‘nroc Decides Sanity.

The modern rules say that the ball
shall be in the possession or the team
last touching the ball before it goes
outside. They also say that a saiety,
which counts two points, is made
when the side defending a goal gives
the impetus which carries the ball
back of that goal. The whole question
hinged on whether Bradley or the
Badger kicker gave the impetus which
carried the ball over the last marker
and outside. The referee decided that
the kicker did.

The score was then 7 mg,
was no change on the score sheet “11V
til the lost quarter. /Then the Big
Ten team made two touchdowns and
kicked one goal-aftei‘»touclldo\vll to
make the score 20 to 2.

Although the scoring was complete,
twice in this same quarter it looked
as though Gi-innell might add to her
tallies. The first came after a fume
ble which the local men recovered just
eight yards short or a score. At the
end at three downs-the ball was just
six inches short of six points. The
Badgers held on the last down and
kicked out or danger. A moment lat-
er a pass to rail brought the ball in.
side the thirty yard line. but the Badge
ers held.

Gouie Tense struggle.

The game was dotted with tense
moments. Twice Wisconsin carried
the ball Within inches of it score and
twice tilled in the final ettort, On
more than one occasion, Mclntlre was
the only man between a Madison back
and the goal and each time the back
was stopped. One or two or Mclntire‘s
kicks were blocked, out were recov-
ered with little loss, Pioneer hacks
broke loose [or lung gains often which
looked its though thEY might end in
scores, but each time some Badger
managed to stop the man.

Wisconsin advertised that her game
With Grinnell would be it gentle Work
out tor her reserves. He plans were
altered to the extent that. she used
eight of the men who Started against
Minnesota much of the time and most
of the other men who got into that
game played some.

It is a coincidence ma! Grinnell
started only eight or the men who
have begun fol'nlcl' Pioneer games this
Year. Brooke, Klngery and Locke
skirted 5L game for the first time in
their careers.

bridlcy Outstanding.

Bradley, Captain Davis and Fall
were the linemen who starred for
Gl‘innell While Mcll‘ttire and Kingery
were the Shining backfield men, The
work of Bradley and Kingei'y Wits Cs-

center position, seemed everywhere on

Truesdale Declares Forty Men
Should Be (‘ut For Basketball

"There should be rorty men out for
liaskctball instcad of the six or seven
that are reporting now," said Director
or Atlileti .lohii C. Truestlale this
morning. He went on to say that in
a school or the size oi Grinncll and
with a male enrollment or 300 that
twenty per cent would be a low )lcl'r
cciitagc to expect to repoit for the
court sport, “Giiiiiicll cannot expect
to have powerlul and winning bas-
ketball [02 s ions as the response
to practice is a mediocre as it is," he
saitl.

As the Pioneer basketball schedule
will be under nu - in slightly less than
a month it is rcasoiiablc to expect
that all men who plan on reporting
tor the squad should report at once
unless detained by lcntball work.
Truesdale‘s opinion i that a coach
cannot be expected to work with such
a sulllll gloup of men as he is at the
present, being a waste or time for the
coach, a handicap to the men reporting

and giving no opportunity tor sci-ini-
mage or competitive drill work,
Jim ’at ltrpnrliug.

Ti-uesdale reported also that there
are a number oi men in school who
are not reporting who have had either
previous varsity experience or prep
school work. Seven men have been re-
porting to the coach lor the bi-wcckly
practice sessions. Tnesc men are:
Coggcshnll, Schmaedecke, Loveioy,
Stiiihlc, Wilhelm, peter-sou and In.
gram.

“The varsity team is la‘r from being
selected,” the coach said. “We are
planning on oaii ng ten or twelve
men on our trips this year, giving ale
most all or the men an equal opportll»
nity to make the trip as u ell as the
squad. ci-iniicll plays cightccn games
this year with Mlssou ' valley teams,
and I he ve that she has a fine
chance to iinish high up in the run-
plug it the material which is uudolll)‘:
edly in school reports."

Came With WaShington Saturday
To Be Hard Struggle For
Both Elevens.

TEAM TO FIGHT FOR WIN

Showing Against Wisconsin Last
Weeli Raises Morale Both
/of Squad, Students.

Grinnell's golden opportunity comes
this Saturday, when they meet the
Washington Bears at St. Louis, The
game will be a hard struggle from all
indications and neither team will have
a great margin oi supremacy on the
“(10110" sheet,

Grllulell will be. ﬁghting hard to
break into the win column since, so
for season, tllEy have tasted de-
erLl. in ﬁve games, and one hits result—
ed iii a e to 6 time. Gl'innell’s show-
ing against the University of Wiscone
Sin at Madison last Saturday WES an
impressive one, which strengthened the
morale of the team and the student
body. The Pioneer running attack.
which had not shown much strength
previously during the season came to
its own, and gained more yardage than
it lJild done in any game this season
up to the Wisconsin game, Several
times during the game, the Gl‘innell
backs broke away around end ior sub—
rtantial gains, while they were rarely
thrown for losses. Grinnell resorted
to passes only on rare occasions
Against Wisconsin, but when they did
they were moderately successful.

Deli-use Iiiipriivcs.

Criniiell's deiense showed marked
improvement over previous games.
Many times, the iPoneer linemen
broke through the raosy Badger for-
wards to smear the hacks for substan-
tial losses. Aside irom a few cut-
back plays, Wisconsin’s gains through
the Pioneer line were small.

The Washington team will come
back from their Saturday‘s 23 to 7 de-
feat at the hands of Oklahoma ﬁght-
ing for victory. Washington‘s early
season record was impressive but
since their 21 to 21 tie with Kansas
they seem worn out, and have‘ fallen
by the wayside.

The game is bound to be a grudge
battle since this year's Bear team in-
cludes seven of last year’s "steam-
roller" treshman team, while Grin—
nell's team includes also seven or last I
year‘s lreshmen. The Grinnell sopho-
niores are still smarting under the
stilig or a 42 to o defeat at the hands
oi the near cubs on Walter Camp
Day. The Pioneers intend to get re-
venge for this detest by trouncing this
Year‘s Bears.

Evahn, whose charlcy-horse kept him
