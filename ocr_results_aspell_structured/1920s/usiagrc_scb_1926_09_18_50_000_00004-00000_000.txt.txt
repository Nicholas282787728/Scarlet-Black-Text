Evalm and Wolf, reserves, are milk
in: the going tough for the quarter»
back aspirants. These two men have
all the major requirements of :L sigr
hairspeeler, and with considerable ex-
perience to fall back on, may be 8:7
pected to give good acenuuts of them-
selves in any game.

Duke and Gray, Sophomores, are
showing lots of fight for the quarter
and halfbuk. assignments. Either is
it fairly reliable ball carrier, but their
Vorth under fire is yet to be tested.
Duke is the possessor of a. deadly
straigh-arm that has been playing
havoc with would-be tacklers in the
early season drill.

Louie Robertson, the Nebraska
sophomore, has made a name i-or him-
self its one or the hardest hitting men
on the squad. He has been holding
down one wing position left Vacant by
MeCluin's transfer tn the bull-toting
smub.

Van Fussen, Drep center 011 last
year‘s yearling outfit, is making up
for Lt deficit in Weight by out—fighting
several of the other candidates for a
guard position.

Heiuie Weitz, last year reserve, is
holding down one of the temporary
guard berths. Heillie carries the
weight necessary to hold the enemy
in chock-st that rampart, but will
probably hold down a guard berth.

“Han" Parks is out making a strong
light ior one of the end posts, and
stands a, fine chance of being in there
when the releree starts the initial
game of the season at Oskaloosa
against the Penn Quakers next Satur-
day afternoon.

A shsksup in the line up will no
doubt some with the the return of
“Sonny" Davis to practice, Davis has

.been seeing the sights in New York

city for several days, returning last
night. Big things are expected of Da—
vis this year; the Greenfield boy was
mentioned by some writers as the
most able tackle in the conference,
and “Sonny" should he in that role
again this season.

Coach Hyland is receiving much
able assistance from assistant-coach
Lester Duke, and Director Frank L
(Duke) Hayes, new Pioneer athletic
head. Hayes had considerable college

 

 

athletics at his Alma Mater, Marrietta,
Ohio, and at the University or Michi-

gridsters plenty of tricl. His present
position seems to he principally with
the backfield candidates.

Two practices a day are getting the
Scarlet clad pig-skin battlcl-s in good

shape for a. strenuous campaign, with .

a schedule embracing eight games,
there is little doubt'l‘hat condition will
