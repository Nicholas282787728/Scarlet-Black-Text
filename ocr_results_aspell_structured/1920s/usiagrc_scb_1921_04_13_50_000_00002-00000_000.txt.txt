A NEW SEASON A slaw START
. Every year at the beginning of a
new season or sports students begin
to speculate on the possibilities or
winning teams, and gossip hashes
over .the records made in previous
seasons, trying to see where improve—
ment is needed. Even at the end or
a victorious season iollowcrs or inter,
collegiate activities heave a sigh of
reliei at the passing oi a long season,
and look lorward to a change. At the
end or a season which can hardly be
called a victorious one, the sigh or
relief becomes almost an audible ex-
pression of joy at the passing of the
jinx arid the opportunity to wipe

clean the slate and smrt anew.

it is peculiar to note, however, how
easy it is for sports follow'ex's to sit
hy and watch those loyal ones who
go out for athletics, and think they
are doing their part hy/sittlug on the
sidelines and cheering. We can pick
many an upperclassman who has
gone through three seasons or ath-
letics each year for the past iour
Years, who would enjoy a seat in the
sun this season, but who has cast his
ballot in tower at another season at
the old grind, to help his college
bring home points in track meets.

why is it that more men do not
turn out tor tryouts on the track?
The iact that they have never done
anything at track' is no excuse, for
it shows that they have never had the
ambition to go out and try. They
have not done as much as those who
have tried and then decided that they
could not do it.

There are three classes who are
not running under the ’college colors,
the class that excuses itseli by say
ing that it has never been out tor
track, the class that says that it has
tried hut is no good, and the class
'that could do it, but is too lazy, or
hasn't that spark oi loyalty that
makes a man do things he would
rather not do, for the sake oi some
one-else.

Of these the class that
won't is the worst. Perhaps
better that men of this type stay off
of the team, for they would surely be

can but

it is

a poor influence on it. The class that
has never tried comes ncxt, Every
man should try. II he is not fast on
the track, he may be able to put the
shot or throw Lhe discus, We could

,mention the names of many who have

found themselves capahle oi such
teats which they never dreamed they
could do, right here on Ward Field.

Now is the time {or every loyal
man to come to the aid 01' his college.
Another year or stilt Missouri Valley
competition tacos the team. it is not
too late to come out and try out for
the team. The coaches will welcome
new men, and will give them serious
advice as to their ability to more

0K lililll’lm ELIGIBLE

An increasing amount or comment
is heard about the campus on the
subdect or hearing eligihle scholas»
tically for outside activities. Almost
daily some organization surlers be~
cause oi one oi its members becoming
ineligible tor participation in some

Public appearance.

floin a subject OI jest to one of con-
siderable concern to students in gen-
We wonder whether the out
side acti has in which the student is
engaged are responsible for his schol-
astic failure, or whether he couldu’L
keep in good standing even if
weren't occupied \\' h other things.
Perhaps the eligibility rules are too
strict. .

neither is the case.
cent of the cases there is no excuse
for not making the required grades
to keep in good standing. We note
with much satisfaction the increased
feeling oi disgust current on the cam-
Dus tor those who do not heal) up
their grades. The man or Woman who
is not eligible is no more the object
of sympathy, but. is instead thought
of as one Who is not sufficiently in-
terested in his work or his part in
keeping up ﬁle standards of the 001*
loge, to make the grade.

It isn’t as if it Were hard to keep
eligible. Anyone will agree‘ that a
person ot only intelligence
can make passing grades hy merely
attending classes and paying attenv
tion. This is not recommended, but
any student knows It is possible. AS
college is said to bring out the best
in a. man, and to be a criterion of his
eligibility for public life in the future
we would dislike to have to stand
guaranty for the success of the “in-
eligible” in his future business exs

TH SAME OLD SPIRIT.

A letter expressing the appreciation
of tho laculty committee tor the well
done by the students in behall of the
drive has been received by the Scarlet
and Bloch lrorn Prol. c. E. Payne, head
of thc iaculty committee on the endow—

being printed in the current number

is signiﬁcant in that it upholds what
has been so oltcn questioned of late,
“the some old spirit or Grinnell.” lt
tells alumni and students that things
have not changed in spirit during the
many years or struggle which the col—
lege has gone through. The letter

not only the existence, but the edlica~,
tional policy of the kind or college oil
w 'ch Grinnell is the type. We may.
well feel that so long as we can gather
such men and women within our walls,
the tutnre of this college is assured.

'Would like to insert here, it I may,
a personal experience. In going about
the country and meeting the alumni. l
have been constantly asked these
questions: "Has Gl'lnnell the some old
son ' "Are the students the kind
‘they used to be?” “Is Gl'innell going
lback?“ These are legitimate ques-
,tions. and they grow out or a real love
:tor the college. In asternals, Grinnell
thus changed greatly in recent years,
,and those interested in her weliare are
lnaturally solicitous that the old spirit
shall not, be impaired. We all hope
,that such interest will never slacken.
ll believe, however, that recent events
should dispel such tears. The present
lstudent body has demonstrated its
spirit in the most tangible and con-
jvincing manner. In tact, the situation
lhas now quite reversed itsell. The

 

"cow paths, that the

ing up?” The student body has, all
unwittingly, issued a challenge —— a
lrlendly challenge, to be sure—to the
alumni to meet a deﬁnite tonglible
standard of loyzll cooperation. What
the response or the alumni will be, I
have little doubt, (or in my experience.

To the Editors oi “Scarlet and Black".
Grinnell, Iowa,

After some years, 1 need not say!
how many, this week 1 revisited Allllai
llatcr. The appearance and condi—
tion or the hacl: lot on which the old,
and new college buildings are grouped
are somewhat unusual. it
seem from the numerous well marked
Murphy's and .

asey's live stock and hired help have
wandered over the lot at pleasure or
perhaps amateur baseball and root
hall have had their iling at the grass.

The ltindling and tire wood on the
back lot have not been collected but
inst lie around handy and convenient
like. Last year must have been ex-
cellent lor foliage and the production
ct leaf molds, since mounds and cow,

would

erings or leaves are in evidence on
every hand, but the hay crop on the
lot was sparse and not worth raking
and throwing into the mow.
Prohably the garbage man had
missed his regular collecting trip and
thus certain odds and ends of stud-
ent activities graced the back lot, 817
though probably he Will gather these
upon his next trip or yet the next.
Sincerely Yours,
Albert Lynn Lawrence, '93.
P. 3. Since penning these lines, I
have read your recent editorial in
lavor or cleaning up and policing the
hack lot. Perhaps you are right.
