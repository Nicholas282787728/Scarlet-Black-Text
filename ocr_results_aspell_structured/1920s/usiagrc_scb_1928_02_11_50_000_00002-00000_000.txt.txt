STI'DENT 0R FACULTY GOVERNMENT!

unless the men oi the college change their attitude
toward the court and student government in general, we
are willing to declare ourselves in inror oi government
by the raculty.

Whether the men realize it or not, that is exactly
the situation they iace now. They must either back up
the judi lal body with their wholehearted support and
cooperation, not only verbally but actually, or accept
iaculty control.

Already criticism has been aroused concerning the
suggested clause concerning punishment ioi- per-jury.
it is said that the embodiment oi such a clause in the
Constitution would give the Court too much power. Such
censure can come only iroih those who do not have the
spirit or student government at heart. Perjury in a trial
is just as had as the otiense involved in the case at
Court. morally at least. It the men want to reserve the
right. ior such it appears to he now with no method oi
punishing it, to lie and gel by with it in Court cases,
then they should be iorced to live under a iaculty gor-
ernnient, which has proven just how summary it would
be. it is better to be tried hy-a court oi equals than by
a body oi peers, a iact which the oiienders would soon
discover.

Now the men seem to have the attitude that the
thing to do is to elect the Court members and then to

regard them as a bod oi policemen to catch no you
can, The more they break rules and got by unpunished
or undiscovered, the wiser they consider themselres. it
is such an attitude that has broken down the student
government morale, and it is such an attitude that will
do more than anything else to irustrate plans ior- a rep
organization. it is the continuation oi such an attitude
that will iorce us to advocate iaculty government,

VIEWER ['Olil

The hlcthodists oi the state are beginning to realize
that it costs money to maintain (our separate colleges
in lowa. conscoucntly a more is now on root to merge
Upper lowa university and Cornell college. It is the
laymen who object to the high costs oi maintaining the
educational institutions, and unless there is a ciit in ex-
penses or a merger, they are going to reiuse to contribute
to the protects oi their less practical brethren

lowa is airlictetl with colleges. The germ or higher
education in on individual style has smitten many peda-
gogues, As it result there are twenty-seven colleges and
universities in iown, according to the lowa oiiicinl Regs
istci- oi 1527-23, and twenty other iuuior- colleges-public
The enrollment in these institutions is

somewhere between iorty and iiity thousand.
seem that lowa were dispensing knowledge by the gr . .

\‘ul‘lous religious groups sponsor a main ty ot the
colleges, aside irorn the junior institutions. The
Methodists have iiorningsrde and Simpson besides the
the mentioned. The Baptists have several iavorite
haunts tor learning, as have the Presbyterians, Some oi
the schools are so small and their lacultics so inadequate
that they disgrace the name college.

Not only because we believe in more education in
business and more business in education. but because
the colleges could he more eiiiciently conducted do we
advocate iewer at them and more mergers such as the
iiethodists are proposing The costs would be greatly
reduced, better instructors could be obtained, the col-
lege social lite would be stimulated and the institutions
could he assured oi something more than a struggling
existence. '

We are prone to agree with iiencken that wholesale
education is not tor the best. The growth oi junior col-
leges is an expression oi this tendency, Wisconsin will
not “see” approximately 1,700 or its ireshrnan ”children"
next ye' , and many other schools are dropping hun-
dreds irom their iirst year classes. Everything points to
the need oi iewer colleges and higher standards.

on: Mouths AGAIN.

ilrs, ida B. Wise Smith is again rallying her co-
hoi-ts oi the Women's Christian Temperance Union in an
eiiort to probe the morals oi the students at the Uni-
versity oi ion-a.

'We oi the younger generation are indeed in a sad way.
We spend hours weeping sympathetic tears oi sell-cons
solutioniu'e hare utterly gone to the dogs and we see
no way out, We drink. we smoke we neck, we do naughty
dances; we are weak willed will 'llys who cannot re~
sist temptation as our parents and our grandparents us-
ed to do. However, we seem to get along pretty well
and we doubt that we will have much to be suspicious
about when we grow old.

it is just such attacks on student morals that pro-
duce much oi the so-called scandal oi the younger gen-
eration. it we are bad, why not live up to our reputar
tiont As a matter oi iuct, student inorols are no worse
than they were twenty years ago, ii they are as bad.

YEARS ago, P. A. showed a clean pair of heels

tained its lead ever since, putting more distance
behind it every year. There must be a reason
why P. A. is the world’s largest-selling brand.
