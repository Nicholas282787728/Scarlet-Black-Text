THE CONSTITDTIDN.

Monday night at eight o'clock is the
zero hour for the new men's govern-
ment constitution which has been pro-
posed by The Lantern. The entire
men's student bodyvhas been called to-
gether to vote on the adoption of this
convsltitution, and if it passes the chair»
man of the meeting will proceed im-
mediately with nominations for Sen-
ate and Court members,

meet with the approval of the 111911. or,
if this is impossible, it Will have to
be dropped.

Every man in school should acquaint
himsell with the provisions of this
constitution before the meeting Mon-
day night. Those who have drnftell
it have endeavored to mske it as sim—
ple and fool proof as possible, and yet
they realize that it is by no means 3.
perfect document. If there are any
questions an attempt will be made to
answer them satisfactorily in the mast-
ing Monday. it is realized that there
will be objections to the fundamental
principle or the constitution, but it
should hs remembered thst these ob-
jectlons are being made by the men
who hate to see their pet organirlation
—-tlle Oracleicast into the discord.
if the student body as it whole is in
sympathy with any organization so
fundamentally Wong in principle,
then there is no use of going further
in this discussion But The Lantern
held the belief thst the men of The
college were out of sympathy With the
Oracle and desired a better and more
responsible organization to take it's
place. This has been provided in the
new Student Court, This court hss
purposely been mode a very poweriul
body. It could not command respect
and prestige if it did not hsye Wide
powers, The Senate has been re—
organized so as to be a. more repre-
Sentntlve body, and at the same time
more cfllcient and effective. The pow.
ers of the Senate have not been materi-
clly cho’ngod. ,

The regular election of members of
these two bodies for the following
year will come in May, cccording to the
provisions of the constitution, hut, in
order-that the system may be put into
immediate operation, or special elec-
tion is provided ior in dis by-lcws
in case the constitution posses the
ratiﬁcation meeting Monday night.

If the constitution goes into effect,—
und tho Scorlct and Black ventures to
make the prediction thct it will—then

’li not, their
the constitution may be revised to'

the new system will have entered
upon its most trying period of exist-
cncc. No one should expect that the
system will prove to be perfect, or
that the constitution establishing it is
the best one thst could have bccn writ-
ten. It reprcscnts what the Lantern
believed to be the most suitoblc under-
present conditions.

In order that the efficlcncy ot the
Student Couprt may be assured from
the very ﬁrst, a. clause has been in-
serted compclling s man to come hc-
fore the Court under penalty of sus-
pension by the administration. This
clause is not in lull harmony with the
principle of sclirgovemment, snd yet
the statements of certnln men as to
tlieir opinion o: the Court made it
necessary ior the present if the Court
is to hove the power that it has been
theoretically given. in the future. of-
tcr the Court becomes a, well estab-
lished and traditional port of Griunell
life, We would recommend the repeal
of this clause and also the one relat»
ing to its amendment If the latter
is repealed, then the former may be
struck out. The clnusc should not be
repealed until the Court has become
Well established and has gained the
respect and prestige that it deserves.
If it does not, then the whole system
is a failure; but we believe that the
Court will survive and grow in influ-
ence on the Grinnell campus, and this
influence should be at power-[ul one
for the good.
