Cornell Tackles Are Strong; Team
1 Is Well Coached by Finger
and Wallace.

, Friday evening the Pioneer fools
Lbull squad will journey to Mount Ver—
non where they are scheduled to meet
their anient rivals, Col-hell, as a.
part of the homecoming program of
lthe Purple and Gray The Cornell
'nggregiltion caught G inuell off guard
last year and registered a 3 to o vic-
tory on Ward field. The locals will
be out to avenge that deleat on Sat
,urddy.

The Pioneers came through Lilo
game against Washington with two
injured men on the list, Taylor and
Crllchett. Both men will be out of
the lineup this week, but it is hoped
that they will be able to face Drake
‘on Oct. 27.

riwnrd Fills Gums ,

Coach Elward has been working
lthis week in an effort to fill the two
positions, made vacant by Taylor
and Critchett, for the Cornell contest}
Green and Scharnweher have run the
the signals with the team, alternating.
at left end and left half. It is prob—
able that these men will fill the gaps
for the game Saturday.

po . cns will he tilled-
the same as they were last week;
Grimes at center, Wood and Dare,
guards; Duke and Nichols, tackles;
Winter, right end; and c. Kingeiy,
Sweet, and Wing in the backfield.

Csrnell will put a strong team on
the fieldSaturday. Although they
lost to Drake, 20 to 0; under the
coaching of the veteran Finger and
AlleAnrerican, ‘;Polly" Wallace, they
are certain to make a strong bid for
the battle.

Cornell Tackles Stlu:

Cornell fans are placing a great
deal of confidence in their two tack-
les,'Wecck and Rummell, who starred
in the Drake game, Hartwell, right
hall, and Kerwin, fullback, are vet-
erans and should do the most effect-
ive work on the offense. Green is
the pilot for the Purple and Gray,
while Wall holds down the other
;hdckficld position, Benesch and
'Dean play‘ the wing positions. Hooper-
‘and Fox play guards alongside of
‘Dee, Cornell-s center and captain.
Vl’itld two victories to their credit,
‘tbe Pioneers are determined to con~
tinue their winning streak by taking
the Cornellians into camp, The men
are not overcontident, however, con—
ce ing the outcome of this ganic for
they learned a costly lesson from
Aol' eieonfideuce against this same team
last year. The student body is hop—
ing lot a victory, for it will then set
