\Vllell Columbus set sail irom the
coa oi Spain in lm, he had no ilcnir
llitc objective in view. He had an
intuition that the earth has round and
as a result conceived the absurd no-
tion that he could reach the East
Indies by sailing west. This he pro,
posed to do. The wiscacres oi his
time to whom lie applied for aid re—
iuscd to be invetgled into any such Vis-
ionary scheme as that. Their money
could be used tor a better purpose: No
sane man would thing or sailing west
to prod something in the east: Colum-
bus save little heed ’to their l'blicule.
He set sail. He failed, That is, he
did not succeed in doing the thing he
promised to do. He did not go tar
enough. One reason why he did not
go iar enough, aside from the unlindg~
ined length or the journey, was that
iact'that he ran against an obstruc~
io, sttid obstruction being a part or
the continent oi North America. This
particular thing was beyond even the
prophetic intuitions oi Columbus. It
had not entered into his calculations,
Hence he tailed. What a‘Iaililre it
was:

The Fighting Spirit of
Grinnell Stalks Campus
With Torch Light Parade

“Here come the Pioneers at Old
Grinnell" will be the battle cry or the
entire Grinnell student body Friday
night when the college en masse will
bciake itseli to parts unknown and
indulge in a pep-rest and get-together
as per the customs oi years gone by.

The exact, and oiiicial title oi this
wild and hilarious escapade is the
"Tor-chligbt Parade," socalled because
oi the tact that everyone will be nro<
vided with torches properly immersed
in kcroscue so as to insure their power
or illumination.

Yes, we will have lots oi noise. The
band will be there with a iew throb—
bing- drums, blatant comets elm,
prepared to rival the saxophone
solos oi Gabrlel himseli.

start From Gym.

The Men's Gym hits been selected
as the rendezvous tor the barbaric
expedition. Aitcr a iew yells to get
up the necessary momentum, torches
will be issued to each and every one.
angry
mob will proceed down into the busi—
nose district oi the city oi Grlnnell
whore they will hit their voices to
the) sky in an cilnrt to notify the town
that the gown is once more very much
in evidence and is not tho least bash-

including freshmen, and the

lot in proclaiming its presence.
There’ll be Oratory.

Next, the line oi march will lead to
a secret somewhere which the lecdor
oi the expedition reiuses to divulge
where speeches irom such celebrities
as "Doc" Huii and Coach Elward will
serve to iniorm every Grinnellian that
:the Pioneers are out for the scalps of,
‘their enmles in dead earnest this tall
and no mistake. It is also rumored
,that cant. "Huge” Nichols will ad»
dress the multitude and declare his
undying animosity against Coe, Drake
and various other schools on the Grid-
ncll schedule this fall.

Nourishment, T00.

And, ilnally, by much clever sleuth
work we have been strongly lead to
believe that some iorin oi nourishment
will be availible for those who feel
the cravings oi the inner-man, Course
we can't say for sure, but perhaps,
maybe, we have a hunch we are right,

Don't iorget, the night is Friday,
the time sovenrlhirty, and every Grin-
nellian who possesses the power or
locomotion is expected to be there.
Just a hit cc advice, wear your old
duds.

Official Figures Are Not Yet Gom-
piled, But Both Dams and
Quad Are Full.

Although the oiiicc refuses to give
deﬁnite ﬁgures on the registration (or
1923.24 since all registrations are not
yet completed, the enrollment looks
very promising tor the coming year,
An unusually large per cent or upper-
c'lcssmen have returned—Sophomore,
junior and senior classes being very
evenly balanced as to number, with
the main competition coming between
the Juniors and sophs, The ireahman
unrolllnent, as always, is practically
twice that oi any other class.

Although the freshman registration
seems to be largely in tlm Libera Arts
department, the School oi Music does
not notice any particular tolling uii in
their enrollment. The registration in
practical music is much the same as
last year, while the classes in theo—
retical music seem to be iuller than
previously. An unusually large num-
her of town children have enrolled >
this year tor instruction in music.

Quadrangle Full.

Miss Itead announces that the Quad—
rangle is practically full and Mr, Mac.
Eachron has had to turn a good many
men away rrom the dormitories, aitcr
doubling up as much as possible in
suites. The proportion between men
and women is very even this fall, with
the balance, as usual, being in lover
or the Women. The principle ot selec-
tion, as inaugurated by the college au-
thoriti s last year, seems to work out
