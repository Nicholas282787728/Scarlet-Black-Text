CAMPUS OPINION

THE QUESTION.

Whit at you think or the plan which
won the no]: Pence 1111111111
THE ANSWERS.

Proi. ii. 5. Cmulrll: It is undoubted-
Iy the must generally accepted plan
that could be proposed because it in-
cludcs only material that has been
fully discussed. I 21111 disappointed
that it docs not propose something

more fundamental and concise.

Dean J. Nollcu: I like it as tar
as it goes. but it does not go 1211-
enough. While 1 am‘ heartily in invoi-
oi the wurld court, I believe we must
join the League 111 Nations as well.

Prof. C. F. Luvell: It is 11 step for»
ward but not :1 big step, not adequate

as at plan that will bring peace; not‘

constructive, for it presents no at—
tempt to settle‘ the Ruhr. which is Air
sane-Lorraine again ailamc. There is
in it no attempt to have n cmnpziign
ct education for pence. This must
tundhmcntcl step is lacking,

It looks like an attempt to reconcile
the Republican party to the League of
Nations. There is in it nothing calcu—
lated to bring back the merit! enthus-
icsni which we hcd during the war—-
when we smv'reul things. The win-
ning plan. however, is a, step forward.
and as such should be encouraged

Prof. It B McCicuous 1 have a feel—
ing that it is hardly adequate. Every
little step forward should be wel—
corner], and each step is valuable just
as this the is. It has the right idea
in that it would hrihg the United

» States into definite and active relation

with Europe.

Proi. IV. J. Rusk: I like the simpli—
city of the plan and believe that some
person in practical political life in
this country is its author. This plan
calls our attention to things which
We are doing unofficially that are
really in line with League [if Nations
and World Court plans.
