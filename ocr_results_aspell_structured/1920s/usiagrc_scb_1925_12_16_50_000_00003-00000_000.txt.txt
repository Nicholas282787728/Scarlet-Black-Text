CONDITIONS IN CHINA ARE
REPORTED BAD BY CHAPMAN,
FORMER GRINNELL STUDENT

Conditions are bad in China, is the
authentic and first-hand information
that has been received from J. Forrest
Chapman, '23, who is new teaching in
the Grinnell-inChiiia School at Te—
chow.

The following excerpts are talren
from a letter which he has written to
friends in Gl'innell:

”Candi ons here in China are in a
sorry condition now. \ The Customs
Conference opened in Peking last
Monday and the two newspapers
which came through to us this week
have brought'eucouraging reports. We
Americans out here are proud of the
stand America has taken toward Chi-
na. if our delegation can just “sell"

' their idea to the others, Japan seems
to have adopted a friendly attitude
which will help matters.

"Surely China deserves a tariff au-
tonomy at least. It is impossible for
us at home to intigine any other
country having special lights in the
midst of the U. S. with gun, boats
there to enforce those rights and with
missionaries spreading a foreign re-
ligiun under protection of treaties
and guns!

“China has made many mistakes,
but, isn't it right that she should have
her own country to do with as she
pleases? I'm absolutely anti-mission-
ary if We have to use force to spread
our religion. I! the religion isn't
enough in itself to invite us here, then
I believe we shullld not be here.

"Just what effect on the Conference
this war may have is uncertain. It is,
~a_t best. pretty bad—or inODFOrhule.
Wu is the favorite in Shantllng so I
doubt if Chang can hold the province.
And yet, one report says that Wu has
expressed a willingness to let Charis
control Chihli and Shantung in his
northern domain if he (Chang) will
recognize IVrlli as a. leader in Central
China.

“Chang's retreating army (coming
back from Shanghai) has now reached
Hanhou in southern Shantung‘. IVe
heard that it was here that they
would make their first smnd against
wu or his leaders, But a later report
says that Tsinan, the provincial capi-
tal, sixty miles south of us, is to be
the base with Techow and the arsenal
as a secondary base.

“Friday's rumor brings the alarm-
ing news that all grain supplies in
.Techow have been seized by the mili-
tary and orders have been received to
Prepare to till-<9 care of 10,000 returns
ing troops who will he quartered
here to guard the arsenal. Carts, arts
lmls, fuel, food and bedding are be-
ing seized from the people. Trains
go no farther south than Tsinan for
fear of being seized by troops or der
railed by the enemy. Three trains
from Peking have turned back at Te~
chow this week. We Wonder how long
they Will Come even this far. All at,
her service has been removed because
soldiers eat and refuse to pay. Res,
ervations are unheard of. If you must
travel you take as little luggage as
possible, wear all your old clothes,
climb in through a car Window as
soon as the train pulls into the Sta.-
tlon, and trust to luck and the sol-
dicrs that it will pull out within the
next four hours. In the car you Will
find all kinds of luggage, for no
freight is aCCEDted now and some
Chinese will Sell produce. Even
goats and chickens may share the
compartment with you."

“You may know or Dr. Luella unn-
er, founder of the Yenching College
for Women in Peking. while attend-
ing the National Christian Council
meetings in Shanghai early in Outer
her this trouble began. She was not
sure she could get out of China by
rail, but, understanding China (es-
pecially in time of trouble) she packed
up and went to the railroad station
“to see for herself” (as We all learn
to do out here)"

Grillllell Journalism Illstnletor Tells
of Books That Are Best Suited
For Cllrisflllils Giving.

"What new books are best suited
for Christmas giving?" This question
was asked ycsterday of Wayne Gal-d,
Grinnell journalism instmctor, who
contributes reviews and critical art
cles to the Saturday Review of Litel'ar
lure, the International Book Review,
the Chicago Daily News, and the Chi-
cago Evening Post.

“ 'Dark Laughter,’ by Sherwood Ali—
derson, heads the list at fall novels,"
said Card, but ‘The Professor‘s
House.‘ by Willa Cather, isn’t far he-
hind. If you’re antldua ed enough to
go as far baclr as last spring, there’s
‘Arrowsmith,’ by Sinclair Lewis, the
best novel of 1925.

“All tin-cc of these books,” he adds
ed, ”are by Midwestern Writers. Alb
derson is from Ohio; Lewis
Minnesota; and Miss Gather, from Ne-
braska. Two novels by Iowa writers
have also been published this tall.
These are 'Gl'een Bush,Y by John T.
Frederick, and 'Thc Odyssey of a Nice
Girl,’ by Ruth Sllckow, "2t Grinnell
graduate.

"In poetry, the year’s headliners are
’Slow Smoke,‘ by Lew Sai-ett, which
should get the Pulitzer prize, and
'Color,’ by‘ Coimtce Cullen, a young
Negro. The leadlng play of 1925 is
‘Desire Under the Elms,‘ by Eugene
O'Neill.
