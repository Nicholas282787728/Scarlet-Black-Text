‘ ing 0! the midnight incandescence.
Herc also In the awsome forest
depths there dwells a queer and our
ious race oi semi-human creatures
called in the vernacular of the
iunglé, Protessorlus rrctundls Pro-
crustean. These creatures talrc great
delight and gain tor themselves a
haughty satisfaction and diabolic glee
by sitting astride branches of the

tree or knowledge which spread its
'great limos over all that wood, and
dropping pellets oi paper upon the
heads at travelers as they pass. Most
curious it is, these missiles, which
‘are no more than tolded squares of
paper, are sntiicient to send crushed
in the dust ct failure, quivering and
'snbdued. the mightest man. and a
mild shower of hlue-hued paper
ﬂoating gently down through the
gloom of the torest. has been known
to send whole flocks or students
crashing to the earth.

Battles With You

The student takes his life in his
‘bantls, firmly grasps his
sword, shaped curiously like unto a
fountain pen, and Ventures into the
'dark undergrowth, On he plows
through the wilderness, assailed by
‘thc rearlul screeches of the Spirit
aforementioned and the unearthly
Whistle of Prolessol'ius Prutundis, as
‘he creates a gale or blue-hooks, cons.
and mid-semester exams.

But the student struggles on, lln»
dergoing binocular and monocular
accumodation in order that he
‘better perceive the ﬁgure of a bird
that flutters there in the
near the fringe at tangled under»
growth. He pricks up his cztrs.
much like the ass his professors
conceive him to be. and he hears a
warble of birds in the distance, and
the faint gurgle o! {reed brooklets,
and he staggers on. llnmlndful of
exams, papers, grades, and profes-
sors, his gaze intent upon the shape
of a tree filled with green buds and
singing birds, fur the outline is fa.-
miliar and he recognizes it as the

struggling old cottonwood in his own ,

back yard.
