Bﬂﬂl] AUDIENBE SEES
“ll’llﬂlNlRY INVALID”

Coffer-Miller Players Please In‘
Presentation of Mohere’s
Famous Satire.

The Coliei'»hllllel' Players delighted
an extremely enthusiastic and tippl'es
ciatire audience in the, A. R H Au»
ditorinni last night with thei inter»
pretatiorr ol Moliere's “The Imaginary
Invalid." The players successmlly
comhated the poor coustics of the an-
'ditol‘ium in their presentation or this
satire or medicine in the days or Louis
XIV. .

Jess Corter as Argan, the imaginary
invalid, carried the brunt or the work
and was exceedingly clever in his in»
terpretation oi Moliel‘e’s lamons sick
man. Argan's iorgetrulness of his in
agined bodily ailments in his ﬁts of
temper was particularly amusing.

Martha Miller shared honors with
Mr. Coffer in her part of Toinette, the
scheming serving maid. Her impair
sonation or the travelling doctor are
torded much amusement. but her work
as the tormentor of Ai'gan was her
best. The rapid changes ot the other
tour members or the cast astonished
the audience with their speed and
completeness. \ ‘

With the exception oi a tow minutes
in the third act when a long and in-
tellectual conversation characteristic
ot Moliere made the action drag a lit—
tie. the audience was in ms oi laughter
all or the time. The play proved that
it was “a prescription to cause exces-
sive laughter

The Cotter—Miller Players appeared
here under the auspices or the Brit»
matic Club and Grinnell Players.
