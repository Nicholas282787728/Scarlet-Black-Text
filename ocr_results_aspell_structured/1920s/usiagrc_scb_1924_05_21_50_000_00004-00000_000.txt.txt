cynical mood.

the curtain on tho uncannily blinks

on the anguished endurance-contest at
the close. Grinnell's first amateur
revua was highly successtul.

The out-standing feature of the pro-
duction was the presenhation or a time
en new songs, written by John Mc-
Gee. All of thorn catchy, tuneful mels

them hid well to prove successiul it

Mrs Mildred Blank, who was prob-

ably the most popular individual ar- ,

toes—and with them, too. She did
some very clever solo work, both vo-
cal and terpsichoresn, and incidently.

New dramatic talent was discovered
in the clever sketch “Jumblcd Drama,"
in which Hezekiah and Hensidzlll
(Clay Hill'shhai'ger and John hlhcr—

with the return of their long lost sons
(Cole van Gordon and Ted Peterson).
Junior wlood and Wendall Metcalf
played well their lessor roles in_this
heart wringing "m‘eller-drsmo."

The scenes were not uniform in
their duality. Many oi the jokes sav-
orcd strongly of moth hails, ot other
things; and much of the dialogue was
atrocious, both in words and presen—
tation. Cole Van Garden and Junior
Wood, though a trifle incoherent at
times, provod themselves comedians
ot the tlrst rank.
