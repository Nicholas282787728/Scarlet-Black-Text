} DAKGER VALLEY

A curious and interesting phenomer
non, the desert mirage, is shown in
the just released picture “Danger
Valley," made by Neal Hart on the
lgi-eat American desert at Death Val-
,ley, Cal. ~

The mirage in “Danger Valley"
shows a clear and placid lake sure
rounded by verdant shrubbery. The
illusion is perfect, and its effect in
:tbe story is to lure a young woman
'into the heart of the blistering desert
where no water in reality exists.

“Danger Valley” will be shown at
the Colonial theatrc Thursday and
Friday.

CIVILIAN CLOTHES

Becoming a butler in one’s own
household in order to cure one's wife
of snobbishness is going pretty tar,
but it works out effectively and re-
sults in much good humor in Thomas
Melghan's new starring vehicle, “Cive
ilian Clothes,” which will occupy the
‘screen at the strand Theatre next,
.chnesday, Thursdfty and Friday.

"Civilian Clothes" is the story oi
an American army captain who mar—
ries a young society girl in France.
she is in love With his nnironn more
than with the man who wears
Consequently when, after she has be-

 

is charming as the heroine ,and the
picture, which is n Paramount, was
directed by Hugh Ford.

ATONEMENT
“What Might Have Been” with a
vengeance describes the story of
“Atonement," the pllotoplay Stall ing
Grace Davison and Conway Tearle at
the Colonial Tllnatre tonight
The plot or this rather unique story

‘ is both unusual and complex. It tells

or the tribulation or a man, who to
save his brother from financial ruin
and disgrace misappropriated funds
of the bank of which he was cashier.
When it is too late he realizes that
by his actions he has wronged his
wife and child beyond reparation by
bilnging them to pcnul'y and disgrace.
