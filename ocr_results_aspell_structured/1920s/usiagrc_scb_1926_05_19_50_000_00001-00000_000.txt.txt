Interest At Deans’ Annual Confab

 

By Joseph .Vlclicc

When l stepped into Dean Filltlldy‘s
oliice he looked up from the letter he
was reading and asked me jllst what
I wanted to know. I had previously
warned him that he was to burst into
print. I tllink l must have been in a
journalistic reverie when I started.

“The dcaus‘ of men conicrellce was
held at Minneapolis on the University

were held in the Minnesota Ulliorr

Eminent Medlolllat Clergyulan, Now at

Has Been Secured.

Dr. Eugene Allen Noble, of New
York City, executive secretary of the
Juillierd Musical Foundation, will lie-
livcr the commencement address to
the class of 1926 of Grinnell College
on Tuesday morning, June 8.

Dr. Noble is a graduate at Wesleyan
University, Middletown, Conn, and
has received advanced degrees l'rom
Dickinson College, St John's College,
Hamilton College, and the University
of Pittsburgh He has been pastor of
several important Methodist churches,
and was president of Goucher College,
Baltimore, irorn 1909 to 1911, and of
Dickinson College, Carlisle, ya, from
1911 to 1914. On the organization of
the Juilliard Musical Foundation,
founded under the will of Augustus
D. Jniliiard of New York for the pur»
pose of assisting talented music stue
dents to carry on their education Dr,
Noble became its active head.

At the close of the address one
hundred and ten seniors will receive
their degrees at the hands or Presi—
dent John Hanson Thomas Main, repe
resenting the board of trustees.

The approaching commencement
marks the eightieth anniversary of

vrew point.

“When the deans of men met in their
own group they discussed housing, dis.
clplinnry and curricular problems, it
may be interesting to you to know that
Dean Coulter has 'clamped the lid
down at Purdue University and there
are no automobiles on the campus
with the exception of those driven by
students who travel back and forth to
school and the cars of men with lain-
dies

“The outstanding figure at the meet-
ings was Thomas A. Cla dean or
men of the University or llliuois.
Dean Clark is called the dean of deans
because he was tllc inst man in the
country to hold the position of dean of
men,

“The personnel men emphasized the
cataloging of each man according to
mentality but Dean Clark held that
the pe ~onal relationship produces
the best results. it was concluded
that the two ideas were not mutually
exclusive but both must he combined.
The man who can do this will be
more successful than the one who
employs only one of the preceding
methods.”

i asked about the manner in which
these discussions were carried on. Mr.
Findlay answer-ed, “Special topics
were introduced by deans who_ had
given them particular study. Alter-
each topic was introduced an informal
discussion took place.

"Deans were there from all over
the United States. These meetings
have been held for six years but this
in the iirst time that a meeting has
consider-ed a constitution. A commit»
fee was appointed to draw up a Dime
stitutroll and report at the meeting
next year. Nekt year's meeting will
be held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta at
the same time as the National Reglse
tra ' convention is held in the same
city.

"The group or deans was taken for
a tour or the university campus visit-
ing enroute such points of interest as
the president’s office, the stadium, and
the various buildings, I was particue
lariiy interested to note in the admin-
istration building- the student postoi-
iiee which has been installed. Each
student has a box and receives all his
mail there.

This also interested men and i ask-
ed, "Is this a university or a govern-
