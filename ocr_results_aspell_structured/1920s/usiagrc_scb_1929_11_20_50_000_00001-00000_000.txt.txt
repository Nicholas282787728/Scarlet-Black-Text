for Creighton Game at

Omaha, November 28.

Hank Thomas, touted sophomore
star of the Grinnell college gridiron.
came into his own after a three

'week's rest against the invading
hords from Carleton last Saturday
and scored three touchdowns in the
sensational 27 to 6 victory which
the Pioneers registered over the
visitors,

Thomas Scored his first touchdown
early in the game, He took the
Carleton kickoff back to the visitor's
40 yard line, Ben Douglas cracked the
line for tour yards and on the next
play Ruff passed to Thomas who
sprinted over the line. Ruff's kick
failed to go over the bar.

After this early flash of speed, the
Pioneers fell into 8. groove of listless
playing and were held at boy by
the harddigbting Carls. chiefly by
the Carleton long passing attack
Which the losers used desperately to
force their way back into Crinneu
ground before losing the ball. The
passes were sent on their way by
McKercher, and found receivers nine
time in twenty-eight attempts.

Late in the third quarter, Captain
Rose decided that the matter needed
‘a remedy of some sort and proceeded
10 intercept a Carleton toss in mid—
field, carrying it back some 15 yards
before he was downed. After plung-
ing to the 20 yard mark, Minier
opened the last period by skirting the
left wing on an end-around play to
the five yard marker. Two line at-
tempts failed before Thomas hurdled

the visitors again opened up with
that long aerial game and advanced
into Pioneer ground, only to see the
ever—present Mr. Thomas hook the
hall from the air While traveling at
full speed on his own 20-yard mark
and race so yards down the sideline
for another score. Ruff’s kick was
again good.

Thomas Runs 53 Yards.

Finding the long runs comparative-
ly easy, Thomas took the next kick—
off and returned 53 yards to the
Carleton 37 yard line. Ruff passed
to Melntire on the first play and the
little receiver sped across the line
with the fourth Pioneer touchdown.
Ruff’s kick was again good and
Coach Watt took Thomasout of the
game to save him for the Bluejays.

The only Carleton score came late
in the game after Coach Vl’att had
practically his entire reserve list in
the lineup. Salvi started lthe works
with a pair of long line plunges. He
negotiated two passes for 12 yards
each and plunged to the Crinnell five-
yard mark. The Pioneer line braced
here but the pounding Carleton full-
back put the oval across in four at-
tempts. His kick failed.

The Pioneer reserves played the

Professors Send
Protest on Books

‘A vigorous protest against the
provision of the pending tariff bill
which gives to customs officers the
right to exclude books containing
anything ”seditious” without the
possibility of judicial review has
been forwarded to Washington by
the Grinnell chapter of the Ameri—
can Association of University profes—
sors.

“We believe that men chosen for
their ability to collect customs are
obviously not ﬁtted to exercise this
censorship,” says the letter express-
ing the vote of the chapter and signs
ed by Prof. Henry s. Conard, secrc-
tary. “The provision makes an un—
warranted limitation upon the free
dam of thought and teaching in the
United States. Such a serious mat
ter should at least be subject to re-
view by a competent court."

 

‘Canada 15 Becoming Bar Room of North
America,’ Lavell Says of the Provinces

By Arline Cale.

“Canada is becoming the bar-room
of North America", said Mr. Cecil F.
Luvell in an interview yesterday, af-
ter having vi ted this summer in
Ontario. Which repealed its prohibi—
tion law in 1927 following ten years
of dryness. “Of course I had a good
time, but the Ontario Liquor Control
law was a fly in the ointment", he re-
marked and then went on to explain
himself.

“Thls law is supposed to be a com-
promise between undesirable wetness
and absolute prohibition. Whether
the people in Ontario want prohib
tion or not, personally, they regard
it as a total failure in the United
States and believe that it would do
more harm than good in Canada as

Malteaser Elects
Six New Members

to Editorial Stafr

Six new members were added to
the staff of the Malteaser, college
humor magazine, as the result of
tryouts extending over the past two
issues, Those added to the humor
staff were: Sylvie Joseph, Charlotte
LaRue, and Madelyn Eckholm;
those making the art staff were El»
len Hendrixson and Steve Comau:
while Claude Welton was appointed
secretary. a position newly
this year.

Practically all of the new mem-
her: have had experience on high
school publications. Sylvia Joseph in
addition to here being a member of
the Malteaser humor staff is also a
member of the news staff of the
SCARLET AND BLACK. Welton
who is a senior this year, is an al-
ternate in the men's Clee club and
has taken several courses in journal-
ism a~t Grinnell.

The work of all the tryouters make
ing the staff has appeared on one
or both of the tryout issues. With
the completion of the members for
the first semester, the Malteascr
staff will be divided into units of
three each to be supervised by the
veteran senior members. The unit-
heads are Doris McCornack, asso-
ciate editor; Lucille Rathmsn: Rus-
sell, Smith, art editor; and Wendell
Eckholm. The special department
heads of the poetry, book review,
and sports Sections\ will form another
unit working u'nde'r the editor.

Harriers’ Outlook
Good Next Season

After having completed a hard
schedule with no losses and four casy
victories to their credit. the cross
country squad is looking forward to
next year's season with hopeful
eyes.

In the four contests this year, with
Penn, Coe, Parsons, and State
Teachers. the barriers have not had
much trouble in annexing four victor-
ies, with the closest score being 20
to 35.

Next year, in addition to the pres~
ent squad all of whom will return,
the team will have Myron Pilbrow,
diminutive prep star who easily won
both the intramural and individual
meets this year. Pilbrow has also
defeated the varsity runners on Steve
eral occasions this year.

other men as RiSSer, Miller, Cer-

hardt, and Fararra showed up well
in the meets this year, and should
make good varsity material next sea-
SOn. 4 .
Captain Secor and Howard McIl-
rath have made the best showing on
the squad this year. In the Penn
meet, these two turned in the best
time of the year by tying for first on
the four and oneetcnth mile course in
the time of 20:53, coming in a quar-
ter of a mile ahead of the next run-
ners.

In individual scoring, Captain Sc-
cor leads with seven points and Mc-
Ilratb is close behind with nine
points. In cross country, low scores
win.

The Pioneers have a big advant-
age over their opponents with a total
of 75 points to 142. The results of
tho meets this year with the time,
and length of course are as follows:
Crinncll Opponents Course Time

20 Coe 35 4 miles 22:53

13 Psrs’ns 37 4.8 miles 25:15

20 I. S. T. 35 4.1 miles 20:53

One of the features Of this year's
meets is that the team has never tak-
en a ninth or tenth place in any of
the meets. These places count heav-
ily against the score of the team.

they think it does here.

“They are trying instead a system
under which the government, through
authorized agents and in Speciﬁed
places. is the sale dealer of liquor.
There are no legally authorized
saloons. If you have a permit you
can buy a bottle or a case, but you
cannot sell it or drink it in a public
placeilegallyﬂj

Three Defects

The reason that this law hasn't work-
ed out satisfactorily is threefold, Mr,
Lavell stated. One item is that you
can buy all you want, a case a day
if you feel inclined. Another is that
this country is next door, and thou-
sands of Americans cross the line,
buy permits, and settle down to the
job of making up for lost time. The
third is that the law is so easily
evaded, and that means as easily as
it is in the United States,

"Since I got back here," he can-
tinned, “I have noticed a recent de—
cision that no vendor is allowed to
sell liquor to children. This is grati-
fying so far as it goes, for now the
grown-ups will have to run their
own errands, which is hard on those
who have got to the point where they
can't run."

At any rate. Mr. Lavell believes,
the Liquor Control law is not a soluc
tion of the liquor problemlt is just
an ingenious financial device. a way
of turning liquor proﬁts into the
provincial treasury. Instead of pri»
vate individuals making money off
of thirsty Americans. the govern-
ment is doing it now. The province
of Ontario has a population of only
two and a half million and an area
equal to three or four of our states,
so it is necessary that it get a good
deal of revenue from other sources
than direct taxation to carry on its
good roads program.‘

The only difference between
American bootleg liquor and Cam
adian liquor is that in the one case
you don't know what you’re getting,

Dibble Takes
Speedball Cup

Beats Langan in Fast Game
to Take Championship

Seventh Time.

In what proved to be the ﬁnest
exhibition of speedball that has been
played here this year. Dibble took
into camp the highly touted threats
from Langan Tuesday aftemocn by
the score of 10-6. This ma/tch was
the last game of the intramural
series and by completing her schedule
without a defeat Dibble ann‘e‘xes her
seventh speedball championship.

Langan started the scoring by
rapidly piling up a_lead of four
points and seemed on her way to vic-
tory, but this lead only urged the
Dibbleites to ﬁght a little harder and,
led by the redoubtahle Patsy
Fararra, Dibble soon found her way
to the front and stayed there the rest
of the game.

Although the match was well play"
ed and the scores comparatively
close, Dibble, with the exception of
the ﬁrst few minutes. held a decided
edge over her rival. Langan depend-
ed on teamwork for her punch, A
few individual stars from Building
Six, inclu‘ding Captain Charles De
Long. John Tatom. and Fararra, took
it into their bands'to chalk up the
scores for the winning team.

On Monday afternoon the Bulld-
ing Four men set back their next
door neighbors, Building Five, in a
speedhall contest. 673. Building
Five, although handicapped by the
absence of some of her players was
the ﬁrst to score. But from that
time on. Four, led by Wolfe and
Scott, took the situation into band
and monopolized the ball later pull-
ing into the lead. This win puts
Building Four into a tie with Langan
for second.

Smith Hall and Five are tied for
fourth place, each with two wins and
three defeats. Kelly Stables holds
down the cellar position by virtue of
going through the season without a
win. The ﬁnal standings of all the

Annual to Have

Popularity Vote
After Christmas

A popularity contest for both men
and women will take the place of the
usual beauty contest in the 1931 Cy-
clone, the editor, Arline Cole, an—
nounced today. Many of the leading
schools of the country feature pic-

‘t'ures of the most popular students in

their yearbooks, and it was thought
that the change would be advisable
in Crinnell because so often nomina-
tions to the contest depend as much
on popularity as beauty.

Students will be given a chance to
vote on their choice tor the popular-
ity contest soon after Christmas va.
cation, when the second subscription
drive will start. People of any class
may be nominated and the pictures
of the winners will be run in the
feature section of the Cyclone. The
results of the contest will not be an-
nounced before the annual comes out.

ed to attend.

The sophomore class has appointed
its social committee which is taking
charge of arrangements for the din-
ner. Frank Furbusb and Frances

Good Interested in Football, Speaking,
Organizing While Student at Coe College

James W. Good, late secretary of
war in the cabinet. of President
Hoover, was a graduate of Coe col-
lege at Cedar Rapids. His college
record was varied and showed him to
have been a versatile man. And his
later records bore out the fact that
he was an organizer and a popular
speaker.

He entered the Coe college junior
academy in the year 1885 and gradue
cted from the college in 1892 after
having spent about two years at the
Iowa state college.

Football Player

Coe's first fo‘tbell team was the re:
suit of Mr. Good's work in organiza-
tion. In 1891, he became interested
in the sport and made arrange-
ments for financial support, managed
the team, and played guard. He
played in the first game against Cor-
nell.

In 1887, he was one of a group of
students who Went on a strike
against the severe disciplinary
measures of President James Mar—
shall when be expelled several stu-

rules.

lvlr. Good showed his possibilities
as an organizer not only in football
but in helping to found one of the
College literary Societies, the Alpha
Nu group which is now disbanded.
Through his efforts, the club room of
this society had one of the first two
planes which appeared on Coe's cam-
pus.

High Blanking orator.

He was also an orator of high rank,
taking part in debate, and winning
second place in a slate oratoricel
contest in his junior year at college.

He was the organizer of the first
lecture Course which Coe College has
had. In taking charge of this course,
he was instrumental in bringing well—
known speakers to the campus and
in organizing entertainments for the
rural districts about Cedar aRpids.

Mr. Good was not only active in
outside Work but was also interested
in his studies. He graduated from
Coe with an A. B. degree in 1892 and
then took his degree in law with hon-
ors from the University of Michigan

 

dents for infractions of the College

in one year.

Playing Merits Comment

Some of these some numbers were
played in Boston in October of 1923
and brought high praise from music-
al critics. The Boston Transcript
commented:

“And still more deeply he delvesi
with his Chopin and his Liszt at
leasteinto the very heart, the in-
most emotional content of the music.
The ballades sing their story from
beginning to end with telling point.
The Mazurkas are. the most exquisite
of rhythmical patterning, The Etude
brings resources of mood as of tone
which one would scarcelykhave be-
lieved possible.” ,

Simllar praise greeted Horowitz's
interpretation of Chopin in Chicago
the following December. The music-
al critic of the Chicago Trlbuneﬂ in
discussing the variations of Carmen
which are the climax of the program
Tuesday evening said:

“The superb, supreme insolence of
Horowitz's own ”Carmen" variations
was a mark for all other pianists to
shoot at, Not that it will be hit for
some time to Come."

On his American tours, Horowitz
has impressed critics and public with
both hiS personality and his great-
ness as a musician. Praise of his
musical ability includes praise of both
his technique and his interpretative
in sight. ,

Has Great Future

Horowitz's European reputation
began with his tour of Germany,
Holland, Italy, France. Spain, Bel-
gium. and England in 1924. European
critics declared him to be one of the
outstanding pianists of the younger
generation and a man sure to be-
come one of the greatest musicans
of his time. ,

McClenon Lectures
on ‘Time’ Tuesday

On account of engagements on
me lecture course, the next meeting
of astronomy lecture series being
given by Professor McClenon will
occur Tuesday, December 10, in
Coodnow hall at 7:15. The subject
will be the sun, and a week later,
eclipses. Whether the lectures will
be continued next year will de-
pend upon the intcrest of those at—
tending.

The subject last night was “Time."
Professor McClenon explained the if»
regularity of the solar day on the
basis of the sun's apparent ecliptic
path through the heavens, and point-
ed out that the only regular time is
sidereal time, marked by the appar-
ent rotation of the stars around the
earth. The time we use. calibrated
from sidereal time, is based on a
mean solar day.
