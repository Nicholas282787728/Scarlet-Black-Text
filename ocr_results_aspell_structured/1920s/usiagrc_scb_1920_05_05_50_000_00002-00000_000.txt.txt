Do You Think

We Influence the Future.

The Men Shroud Develop
a Spirit at Unity.

The Chapel Hour Silollltl
Be Changed.

In an editorial printed in the Scarlet
and Black for April 26 the develop-
ment of a men's life in Grinnell was
spoken of as the most important prob-
lem coulronting the college at this
time. Before the problem can be dis»

cussed in detzul it would be well to
remind ourselves again that it is not

a thing which‘can be settled in a day,
The development of the college as a

whole as well as the development ol
any of the sub—departments of college
life is something which has been go-
ing on ever since the college was
tounded and which will continue as
long as Grinneu exists.

This means first that in directing the
development of the college at present
the organization which has been hit-
queathcd to us by past generations is
the ﬁrm foundation on which all fur-
ther progress must rest. We would
do ill to belittle the worlt or those
who have gone before us, for, inter-
preted in the light of the present, we
have no more valuable asset than this
in the ivorl: which we shall do.

The lact that the past now holds

and always will hold this important
place in the life of the present magni-
ﬁes the importance of the steps which
we take now. In a short time
they will he a part of the past and
will in turn have tin inﬂuence on all
succeeding college generations. For
the sake of the future welfare of the
college it behooves us to build for the
future as well as for the past.

___G___.

The fundamental ideal in develop~

. ing the meirs life of Gl‘inuell, in our
opinion, should be the creation of a
distinct, uniﬁed life for men which.
will stand independent in the college
life.

By unity we mean something more
than mere living together. This is arti—
ncial while the unity for which we
argue is a deeper, more lundamental
spirit of loyalty among the men of the
college which shall bind them together
in a group life which they can truly
call their own. The dormitory group
is the nucleus around which such a
unity can be developed.

But generalities will not get us far.
What are some deﬁnite practical steps
which can he taken to bring about
this ideal

For one thing the organization of
the men’s lite can be kept separate
from the organization of the women's
life. If either is to succeed they must
shut themselves entirely away from

any inﬂuences, whether direct or llldiw
rect, on the part ol each other.

On the positive side the more free
oiieut combination of all the men for
some common purpose will do much
to develop a spirit or unity. The ath-
letic carnivals which have been staged
during the past year were a. start, but
more should he done along this line in
future. Might We suggest an all col-
lege men's banquet or a musical coni-
cdy to be staged entirely by inch.

Chapel attendance continues in be
small. In this Connection it is ll nute-
worthy fact that no one appears to be
interested in ascertaining the reason
or attempting a solution of the difﬁ—
culty. The Scarlet and Black cola
umns are open to any and all who
wish to discuss the matter. Has any—
one anything in say?

In a ballot dealing with the chapel
question which was placed before the
students last year the suggestion that
the hour he changed from nine to ten
o'clock was voted down. The fact
that the question of a change in hours
was raised lends it some significance.
The argument in favor of a. later hour
is that more students are on the cam.
pus and more would naturally attend
the service. Is the point valid? Let’s
have some ideas!
