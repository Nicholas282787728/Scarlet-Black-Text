Cambridge-Beloit Debate Shows

Different

Styles of Argument

 

The Cambridge debating team which
will meet Grinnell here Saturday
night, recently debntcd Beloit in a
platiorm clash which showed clearly
the dittorence between American and
English debuting. Following is an
account of the debate taken from the
Beloit Round Table:

“Three young nlen from England,
debaters representing Cambridge unir
versity, interested, amused, educated,
and provided It striking contrast for n.
Beloit audience in the chapel last
Wednesday night.

“From the moment the three polish-
ed young Brinshers launched their
goodsnatured, witty, and yet keenly-
barbed attack. upon prohibition, the
audience began to sit up and. listen
closely. The easygoing, bauterlng

‘ attack of the negative upon the ideal

trast to the earnest, perhaps too as.
gressive, defense oi the Beloit team,
And the contrast was one not highly
complimentary to Beloit.

“Eeloit's debaters, possessed of a
series or statistics gathered in the
short time they had to prepare tor the
international encounter, were obvi-
ously handicapped from the outset.

wits and arguments. Trained in the
typical American manner of debating,
an aggressive, direct and perhaps
somewhat crude, though forceful,
manner, Beloit’s representatives
were badly matched against the
cream or the great English univer-
sity‘s speakers.

"The cool and deliberate manner ot
the visitors, their twisting of rapier
thrusts clothed in silk, was obvious—
ly an irritant to the aggressively-
trained Beloit debaters, and the
sparks struck threatened to ilaine
several times when uncalled for
thrusts were aimed at the visitors,
who desired ‘nathing more than a
friendly argument.’

"Unstinted praise and admiration

debate is something to be won, it is a
contest. English debaters are never
