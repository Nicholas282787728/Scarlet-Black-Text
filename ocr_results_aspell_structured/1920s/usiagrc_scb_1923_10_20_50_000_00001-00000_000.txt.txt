Coach Elwnrd and Twenty-ﬁve
Men at Mount Vernon to
Battle Purple.

TAYLOR ANT) CRITGHETT
OUT WITH INJURIES

Uorne
di oner for Drake Battle
Next Week.

Coach A. H, Elward and a squad
of twentyslive football men left yes-
terday afternoon for Mount Vernon.
where the Pioneers will meet Cornell
this afternoon in the latter’s annual
homecoming battle. Although the
Grinuell team and Student body real-
ize that this will be a hard game,
nevertheless they are pointiogto this
game as a sort of for humor to the
big contest with Drake on October 27,
which is the date of the Grinncll
homecoming.

The outcome of the gain'e this after—
noon is doubtful, for there is almost
no dope available. It is certain that
Cornell will put up a big fight for
victory, playing before a large homes
coming Crowd. On the other hand,
the Pioneers zu‘e handicapped by the
injuries of two players, Taylor and
Critchett. who received arm injuries
in the Pikel‘ Contest. The men are
C’ltkrmlrmd to keen their losinff col-
umn blank for this game in order to
prepare everything for the Bulldog
battle. l‘ p

‘ Drake Hus Open Date

The Bulldogs have an open dete-
today and they will use this to good
advantage in getting in shape for the
Grinnell game. The cantest this’
year is being played before a large
homecoming Crowd on the Grinnell
gridiron Realizing this, Drake has

' adopted the slogan, “Everybody to
Grinnell," and is attempting to bring
over a thousand rooters to offset the
Grionell advantage of playing on its
home field. .

Grid-Graph at home
The stay—at-homes this afternoon

will probably watch the game via the
grid-graph method with intErest, for
it will give some indication of the

’Gurdon Mceter of Hawarden, Iowa.

a meeting of the freshman squad heldi
Friday evening. Meeter plays any
backfield position and has shown up
well in spite of the fact that he has,
been handicapped by injuries. He
came to Grinnell with four years mots
ball experience obtained at Hawarden
High School and gives every indica—,
tiou of developing into a valuable:
man.

\The freshman teams have been

startled by strange harmonies and
disturbing chords, but in every in-
