THE VALUE OF DOUBT

At one time in the history at our
racial development, it was thought
that intellectual activity and doubt
were sin. Oul' medieval predecessors
were ior many years without educa-
tion ior this reason, and in ancient
times a philosopher was put to death
for corrupting the youth of the time
with his questions and answers as to
the why and the wheretore or man. It
was only with the coming of philoso~
phical speculation and doubt that there
came a movement toward general ed-
ucation and improvement.

Self satisfaction causes one to stand
still while wonder oi- curiosity pre—
vents complacency and sell satisiec—
tion—the enemies of intellectual life.
In the Renaissance period the doctrine
was formulated and circulated that
“by doubting you come to examine and
by examining you learn the truth."
This theory which ﬁrst came to liie
in the twelfth century is equally ap—
plicable to the present time and plays
an important part in the life of the
present day. It is tl'ue in national rind ‘
international affairs, and in its relax;
tion to college conditions, as well.

.rlubmnl Editor;

The variety or interests in the or-
diiiury college automatically divides
the student body into groups which,
ll too greatly stressed, develop into the
more common and less desirable oil

that it overlooks the duty which it
owes to Its contemporaries, is usualr
ly semi effective. However, the gen-
eral interests of the student body are
usually the best interests or the indie
‘lidual group and the Student Council
is showing what can be accomplished
by the active eiforts and mutual help
of representatives from all the campus
organizations.

Just as the organizations are tempt-
ed to develop tor selﬁsh purposes, so
is the individual apt to forget the part
that he must play in campus airalrs
and is inclined to slip into the rut at
least resistance and less effort. It
has repeatedly been proven in class
and building functions that the mem—
bers or the committee are the only
workers, and very otten practically
the only ones in attendance. Such in-
diiierence, in Grinnell, cannot be laid
at the door oi other engagements and
should not be due to the nature or
the entertainments. The one explan-
ation seems to lie in the lock oi under-
standing and or appreciation oi the
importance to campus life of the
function being slighted. We seem to
have taith in those in charge and a
supreme beliei in that kind tor-tune
which watches over college students
and will insure the success of any and
all or their projects. Unfortunately,
Aladin and his lamp have long since
been relegated to unfamiliar regions
and we no longer have willing genii
to slave ior us. On each of us rests
the responsibility ior our own success
and for that of our various interests.

lllSTOltr ASSAEED

An educator agrees, in port at least
with Henry Ford's iamous utterance
that history is “bunk.” Prof. Kirsopp
‘Lake, historian and teacher of church
‘history at Radcliilc college, iolloivs
‘lir. Ford to this extent:
“History is all hunk, he is quite
light, if it is taught merely as a suc-
cesslom oi evenm with no relation to
present day life and conditions. But
ciety as it is, with all its good goalie
ties and its bad qualiues, then the
study or history makes society, as it
is, rational and possible to understand.
Otherwise it seems train a mad house,
with all the disturbances totally in-
comprehensible.”

Then to this charge is added the
fact that much history. especially as
it is taught in the schools, represents
prejudiced views, that its tendency has
been to glorlty war, to place undue
emphasis on the military rather than
the political and social developments
and that too oltcu it develops into
propaganda, the indictment becomes
iormidable.

History purports to be the truth.
It ought, above all else, to be just that.
But truth misconstrued

"Eritishers" at the time of the revolu-

would have us believe

tion were villains and oppressors, and
that all or the colonists who resisted
England were the embodiment 01' pa—
triotism and virtue, they taint the
truth. When they lead us to believe
that Waterloo was a vastly more im-
portant historical event than Magma
char-ta, or that Napoleon was greater
in his contribution to human progress
than Justinian, the relative greatness
being implied by emphasis, they be
come not the true record of the hu-
‘man nice, but a distorted account
from which only false deductions can
be made.

What Do You Think?

Editor Scarlet and Black:-

I would like to second the ideas ex-
pressed in one article in the "What do
You Think?“ column at the last "Scar—
ch and Black.” There are many men
in the college who do not dance or
who do not care (or it especially, i
imagine there is the same condition
among the women. These students
are entirely left out or account. But,
not considered from misi‘stacndpoint.
it is Wrong to center the great ma-
jority oi the college social lile around
dancing. Dancing is all right but it
should not dominate our Socizl lite.
There should be another part to the
recreational hours beside dancing.
Games are acceptable and perhaps ﬁt.
in best at that time. But also at a.
diilel'ent time from the recreational
hours there should be social gather—
ings, i believe we can get better ac—l

dancing. Informal groupings at the
