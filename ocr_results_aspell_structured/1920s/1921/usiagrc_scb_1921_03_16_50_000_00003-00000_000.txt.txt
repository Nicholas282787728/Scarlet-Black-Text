Whatever her ago Site already is an

 

 

 

artist, sensitive, emotional, spirited—
an artist who combines tenderness
with extraordinary vigor, grace and
delicacy with warmth, yes, even with
passion

Her technical mastery is amazing.

ness, unmarred by
scratch on the attack! What rhyme
mical verve! What elasticity. supple-
ness and sweep! What lightness and
elegance:

You should have heard her crystar
line staccati on tlde upward stroke in
the E major Viouxtemps concerto
which introduced her on her listeners
after the introductory "Oberon" over-
tore.

Verily the pertormsuce or the
Vieuxtemps composition was a tour
de tor-co; more remarkable even than
her periormance or the Mendelssohn
concerto, for there she adopted a pace
somewhat too lively ii; the second
movement and outrah the accompany-
ing orchestra in the Finals.

Martini-s Gavotte,
“Schocn-Rosmarin" and Sarasate's
"Faust" waltz arrangement, accomv
panied on the piano by Miss Alice
Moiini, gave Erika an opportunity to
display the more dainty and piquant
blandishments of her art.

How tascinateingly she gave the
Kreisler piece! Could the composer,
indeed, have done better? How she
caught the spirit or the waltz in her
vitalizing rhythm:

A feminine Helletz you might call
this girl. But she is more than that.
For with the technical assurance of
a Hoitetz she combines not only the
temperamental iorvor of an Elmsn,
but the in 'nuittingly expi’essive‘tone
and rhythmical verve or a Kreisler.

(Above is an exact reproduction oi
the notice received by Erika Mol'ini
after her debut from the noted critic
Max Smith January 27th, 1921.)
