Plenty of Guard: Material But
Absence of Gamer Felt
Among For-word Men.

MISSOURI, NEBRASKA AND

AMES TITLE GONTEN'DERS ,

All These Teams Have Veterans
Back Who Will Materially
Help Their Chances.

Coach "Bud" Saunders’ call for
basket ball men last Monday after-
noon brought out about twenty candi—
dates for positions on the imrsity
squad, but as yet it is a little too
early in he season to attempt an esti-
mate of the strength of the team which
will represent Grinneli on the basket
ball floor this year. First hand in-
dications, however, are that there is
little cause for worry about the guard
positions.

Garner Missed

Forwards are at a premium at pres»
ent, but it is hoped that some of the
forwards of last year's freshman
squad can be developed in the course
of the season into cage artists of mer-
it. "Dutch" Garner, a veteran for-
ward, has not been able to get out for
practice yet. He has a keen eye for
the hoop. being high man in the class
series held last week. . His return‘to
the squad would add considerably to
the offensive strength ‘of the team.

Every afternoon for the past week
has been devoted to fundamental prac-

tice such as shouting baskets, pass-‘

*ing and playing team Work. There
has been no scrimmaging done yet
and it is expected that work before
the holidays will be condned largely
to rudimentary drills.

suit Schedule

Indications at present point toward

a stiff season for the Pioneer basket—
’eers. The first part of the schedule
' will in all probability be the hardest

because of the fact that the ﬁrst seven
games are to he played away from
home on strange ﬂoors. The ﬁrst
trip which the local squad makes will
be a. three game affair with games on

Jan. i, 5, and 6 against the Kansas

Aggies, Kansas IL, and Oklahoma. In

order to play such a schedule IA. Will
be necessary to carry a considerably
larger sound than usual on trips away

,from home.

The Missouri Valley basket ball ses-
son will nrohbly he the fastest this
year that ii. has been for some time.
Kansas U. has most of its men back.

i The Kansas Aggie: have a raw team
but they have a. new coach, Curtis, who
‘ coached Chicago u. last year and may

'spring a. surprise with his 1'sz motel”

isl. Oklahoma has several veteran

men left including the famous Wait.‘

whose playing at center will he re-
membered by those who saw him in
action last year. Drake begins the
season With practically the same team
which it had last year. Coe can be
depended upon LO Ill“. out 8. fast team,
but it is not expected to he as for-
midable an opponent as; the Valley
conference teams. Cornell has the
same team back which Grinnell clean-
ed up so thoroughly on our home ilcor
last winter. Both Missouri and Ne-
braska have Veterans back this year
and both will undoubtedly be strong
contenders for the Valley title. anshr
ington looks stronger this season than
Last. Ames, with almost her whole
squad back will have an cxpcrienced

team which stands an excellent chance .

of heading the Valley when the season
is over. In spite of the
schedule which looms ahead of them
the Pioneers are conﬁdent that under
coach Saundel‘s’ supervision 5}. team
will be developed which will afford

It has been decided that the active.
endowment campaign among alumni
lwill close December 31st. This decis-
lion was made at a joint meeting of the
Aexecutlve committee of the graduate
council and the executive committee
of the trustees Thursday night at the
Grinnell Country Club. Announce-
ment was made that 60% of the living
alumni have pledged to the endow—

MISS EVEEATE EAEAIAE
BHAWNAAG—EPIIJ FDEM

"Pompom.” v. Triﬂe High Brow,
But Is Well Received by
Large Audience.

Miss Katherine Jewell Eyerts. well-
khown dramatic reader, was very welll
received by a large audience at Herrickl
Chapel last night Miss Everis, who‘
was to read from browning. presented
“Pompelia”, from "The Ring and 1116‘
Book." upon the insistence of the lee—
‘iure course committee under whose.
auspices she appeared. ‘

Miss Everts is noted thruout the
country as one of the leading expon-‘
cuts of the art of literary and dramatic
,rcadlag and very ably interpreted the
lpart of Pomnella.' However, there was
:considerable disappointment exhibited
'by the audience that the committee

 

 

had forced Miss Everts to change her
program at the last minute. The read- A
ing of ”Pornpelia", and the hearing in
read, was an experience but it was
more a sensation of the moment thanA
In last impression and it failed to give‘
lthe majority any conception of Brown-
me.
It is natural that the committee
should wish to bring numbers here
‘that will be informative and cultural
in their inﬂuence, but it is a mistake‘
for them to misjudge their audience.‘
A crowd of college people such .as'
gathered in Herrick Chapel last night
are cager to hear the poems ot Browrt'
inglwiih a universal appeal but they
were not prepared, either mentally or
by training, to hear anything of the
depth of “Pompeiia.” Those who proﬁt-
ed from the reading were the advanced
scholars of Browning alone. while the
poem passed completely over the heads
of those unfamiliar with the poet's
works. To Miss Everts goes all credit
‘for performing her difficult ask in
a very pleasing manner. and to her
should go the explanations of the com—
mittee.

Staff Reformer Makes Interesting
Suggestions to Our City Fathers

 

0 temporal 0 Moi-es: A wave of re-
form is sweeping Grinncll as it has
never been swept since the cyclone of
1332. The watch-dogs oi the public
morals, dumbfounded at the rapidity
with which the community is beading
straight into the region of tire and
brimstone. have resolved to dump
some cinders in the path of our downs
ward toboggan.

Not desiring to be second to anyone
in the matter of moral cdincation, the
staff reformer makes the following
suggestions to the powers that be in
the hope that they may be found con-
sistcnt with measures already adopted.

In the first place, or college colors
should be changed; they are entirely
too suggestive for a community that
believes damnation comes in cartoons,
Scarlet stands for passion—suppose
the Honor G should be confused with
the “Scarlet Letter.” Black denotes
evil. We suggest as substitutes City
Hull Blue and Judgment Morn white.
Of Course, if this suggestion is adoptv
ed, the depot must be repainted and
several college buildings undoubtedly
should have a coat of white-wash.

The Kewpies which adorn the win—
dow of a local store should either be
removed altogether, or at least sup-

PEAN BANQUET EDA
‘ ALE EAMP EASTER AAENl

Jansse'n, Miller
charge of Affair To Be
Given 'After Holidays.

A

At the last meeting of the Camp,

Foster Club held Tuesday night in the
A. R. H. it was voted to hold a ban-
nuet immediately after the Christmas
holidays. '

A banquet committee composed of
Laurence Janssen, chairman; Pence
Miller and Millard Gelvin was appoint-
ed by the temporary chairman of the
club, and these men are now at work
on the plans. It is planned to extend
invitations to Harry Goodrich. state
Y. M. C. A. worker, Dwight Lewis,
and president of the v. M. C. A. at
Iowa University. Election of officers
will be held at the banquet and plans:
will be made for the coming year. A

All men who have ever attended
Camp Foster should band their names,
to any of the banquet committee or
Dudley Gillette, whether they intend
to go to the banquet or not,

plied with decent rainient. For the
Venus de Milo we suggest a Mother
Hubbard gown, or at least a pair of
artidcal arms with which she could

now possesses. The aesthetic value
or descobolus certainly would not be
marred by the application of a sweat
shirt and some gym trunks.

Why don't the City Fathers repeal
the Dido episode in Vergil's Aenead or
pass an ordinance against the Cleopa—
tra. affair in Roman history? Coach
Saunders should be solemnly forbid—
den to inject any punch into the has.
kcthull tenth—Some puerile minds
might take him to literally.

We have beaten informed that one of
our local drug stores. owned by a
rnim of good standing in church and
community, still sells Cough drops,
sen sen, and hoarhound candy over the
counter in brazen dedance of the na—
tional law against artiﬁcial stimulants.
We are withholding his name for the
sake of wife and family,

And to treat the international as»
pect of the situation briefly, it might
be remarked that a light in the balcony
of a certain movie house would pre-

vent many an entangling alliance.

was under the direction of Professsor .
liv. H. Bridge, assisted by Mrs. Hallie
‘Flannigan and Miss Grace Kutisb, and
was sponsored by the Kiwanis Club

The drama was presented in a
thoroughly finished 'and professional
manner and revealed n. good deal of
talent as well as careful coaching.

The play is by Haddon Chambers
and is a sincere and human story
that is not at all stagey. Stellar hon—
ors may be distributed throughout the
entire cast. Tom Burroughs did splen—
did work in the difficult role of Sam»-
,uel Burns, a tramp. Dr. E. E. Harris
Agave an excellent interpretation of the
Abrought—up-in-the-scrvicc valet, with a
keen dislike for all Classes below him.
Mrs. W. A. Bridge and Miss Doris Vir~
dcn successfully carried the feminine
leads as the former and present
‘sweethearts of the young scholar, Wa-
verton. Wavcrton was played by
Clarence Richards, who very success—
fully presented tbc part of the young
bachelor, around whom the action cen—
