REGULAR SQUAD BERTH

Missouri Still in Unshaken Posi~
tion as Valley Basketball
Leader.

Hal (i work and haul luck have char»
acterized the elforts of Pioneer basket
artists during the last half of the Week
in Preparation for the Ames battle
here Tuesday.

The chief revelation is the [act that
"Freddie" Benz, the newest member of
the squad, seems to have gained a
regular berth as a result of his hrll~
liant Dertormance in the ﬁnal Corny
hustler contest last week.

The hard luck. is that Janssen, who
has‘lilayed some time at guard,
sprained El. traditionally 'werlk ankle
and will be out (or some time.

After a rest on Tuesday} the Pio-
neers buckled down to still Workouts,
and they have been hard at it. Prac-
tice has included scrimmage with the
prep squad, which has been waxing
strong under the businesslike tutelage
of “Bud” Saunders, and it is on record
that the varsity has gone down to Lle-
feat on more than one Occasion. ’

While the odds are much against
them in Tuesday's battle with Amesi
the Pioneers seem to be ready for a
battle, and the contest should he an
eye~opener.

Socialist to Speak on “Reconstruc-

at Chapel,

Jolllt Sparse, probably America's
most noted socialist, nnd author of
several authorithtive books on tho
subject, will deliver a lecture in Hal's
rick Chapel Wednesday, Februai 23,
on “The Reconstruction ol the Social
Order.”

Mr. Spar-go has not been affiliated
with the socialist party sincc 1917, at
which time he severed relations with
that organization because of its at
titudc toward the war, and comes to
Grinnell not as a representative of
socialism, but, as an indcpendent stud
cut of social problems.

Spargo‘s earlier w ngs are re—
garded by many as tho clearest and

future» meetings llnost attractive statement of the so—
‘cialist principles.

For some time
past he has devoted himsclf to an
aggressive campaign against Bolshe-
vislu. As a student of sociology, he
is neither an extreme radical nor
conservative, and will probably make
statements in his lecture which will

 

interest backers of both faiths, ac-
cording to Prof. G. P. Wyclloft.
