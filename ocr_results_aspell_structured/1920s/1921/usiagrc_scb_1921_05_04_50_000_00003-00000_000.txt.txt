It is understood tllat the play was
staged arid luauaged entii ly hy studs
ellts, with Kenneth Getldes, '21, pie».
siding over the lrniiurscripts as coacll.

Although the play lacked some of
the finish that many of the [armor
literary society productions have
showed, the work was on the whole
well done. With one or two cxcen
tions, the characters were well chosen
and fitted their parts. It was a dil r
cult play tor a cast or American calr
loge actors to interpret, since it
played a great deal on the caricature
oi British life. For an inexperienced
actor to try to act the part or a char--
acter which he had probably never
even seen or- met, was something of
a proposition.

shape, although the makeup oi Cole

would slut a rillian iii a nlo e thriller
a little better than a jovial British
tl'avclel'rexlllure .

The best pare of the play was the
natural stage presence oi the cast. ill
spite of the fact that it was “the first
attempt" of most ot them, they needed
little prompting and most of the time
kept up with their cues,

It becomes more and more difficult
