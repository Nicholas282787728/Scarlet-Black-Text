THE BACK Row HABIT I
(From Dally Kansan) :

The ﬁt, the Lines and
the Price of these Ox—
fords will please you.

Very often a student, upon entering

lsummcr schools during 1920; in the ,

a classroom, sidles past the lust thi-cc
or four rows of seats and piclr-s out a
chair in the back part or the room,
preferably in the rear row and near
one or the corners. The conlrrmed
student of this type has the back my
habit. l

Place him on the trout row and he
is last; he cannot accustom himscll'
to such proximity With the :nstructor
and is seemingly simul- dumb on this
account; he is ill at ease and fidgety
and grains nothing from the period
But let him select his lavoritc chair
in the rear and he is perfectly at
home, can more an excellent recita
tion, and is often one of the best stud
ents in the course.

The back row habit is not essential
1y detrimentanl to the student, but is‘
does nevertheless create a rather un-

favorable impression on his associates
who are acquainted with him in the
classroom, for no other reason than
that this habit is usually acquired by
the slackers 1n the course, who at-
tempt to mboggan through their
courses with a minimum of time and
extort expended in preparation.

Made with p 0 p ul a 1'
Cuban Heels, in Kid or
Calf leathers. .Choose
either Brown or Black.
