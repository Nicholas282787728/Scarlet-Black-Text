Harshbarger and Benz Lead Team"

Mates—Other Captains to
Be Chosen Wednesday,

with the election oi captains by two
or the class basketball teams and an.
uomicemeiit or regular practice per-
iods, [he interclilss case series took
dehnite shape Tuesday night. Clay
Horshbarger will pilot the senior
team and Freddie Benz, a \a ity man,
last rear, will captain the sophomore
squad. The jlllliul's and ircsbmcn will
elect captains beioic \lietlnesday night.
The ﬁrst practice Tuesday showed a
considerable amount or gum] material
especially in the lower classes, and
predictions point to an interesting
series. '

Because oi the gi eat interest shown
in inter-dormitory baseball mammot-
ball, as well as indoor contests, last
year, the physical training department
has added a list at new sports tor t:
coming season.

The most popular of the new sports
will probably be wrestling. This is
not a new sport in Grinnell, but here—
to fore it has been conﬁned largely to
the physical training classes. lts ad-
dition to the list of intramural SDul s
is the ﬁrst attempt to stimulate any
sort oi keen compehtion over Wreslr
ins. . ,,

Cageball is another of the new
sports. The great interest al’ousedl
over this same during the past few
weeks in the regular physical train-
ing classes iortells an interesting ser-
ies between the dormitory units.

hir. Raymond w. Rogers, head oi
the physical training department, has
announced that because of on extrar
ordinary demand tor extra apparatus
work a class will be established im-
mediately following the class basket—
ball series which holds the center of‘
the stage at the close or the football
season. V

Plans for these ditierent sports call
for the organization or classes as soon
as the interelass series is out of the
way, and all men interested in any'

or them, especially wrestling or box—1;.

ing, shCuld see Mr. Rogers Within the
