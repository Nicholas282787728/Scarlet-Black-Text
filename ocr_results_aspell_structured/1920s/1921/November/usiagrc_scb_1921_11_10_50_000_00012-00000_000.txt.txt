Granted that a social service worker
has the personality. his value depends
upon his culture, his knowledge of hu«

.he versatility of his naming, and his
power to direct others and to rvork in
co-operation with educated people.

MEDICINE.

All medical schools placed itr class
A. by the Council on Medical Educ»
cation and Hospitals require at least
two years' college training after a fortr—
year high school course. This Class
A group includes all the recognized
medical schools in the United States.
The best medical schools. such as

field. They fall into a rut, work by
rule of tlrirrrrb, and liobody ever heats
of them."

The Institute recommends that stu
dents desiring their thorough six—year
course ﬁrst take an A. 13. degree. The
other engineering schools of the ﬁrst
class demand preparation in liberal J
arts or require their students to take
such trr'ring in addition to ihe teelrrii-
cal tra' ng. If you desire the ﬁve
or sin—year course, stich as the Ulri—
versity of Iowa or M. I. T. gives, you
may take three or four years at Grin-
rrell and one or two years at the techni-
cal school. thus earning the A, B. de-
gree arid the technical degree. There
are many advantages of this method.
You can conﬁrm, without loss of time,
your choice of a profession, Yoti gain
the invaluable broadening culture that
the life and community interest of Griri- ,
nell gives, When you come to the
graduate school, your knowledge of
life is broader and you can corrfrrre your
study to real specialization in your
chosen ﬁeld. In engineering, as in all
highly technical courses, your success
as a student arid in after life depends
upon broad foundations.

Pi’c»EngirieellIlg Courses

Though Grinnell offers no engineer-
ing degrees, she specializes in prepara-
tion for professional work in such a
way that graduate schools cordially
recognize her credits and recommend
the broad culture and accurate tra’
ing to he gained at Grinnell. The p
engineering courses give special atten—
tion to those who are planning a tech-
itical course iii civil. mechanical, arch:
itectural, structural, electrical, or clrenr- ‘
ical engineering. l

r
i

 

Some of these courses are: Mechan-
ical Drawing, Mathematics for En-
giueers, Surveying. Lettering, Hy»
draulics, .Gi-aphic- Statics, Differential
arid Integral Cacculus, Analytical
Geometry, Descriptive Geometry. Cal-
culus and Differential Equations, Gerr-.
eral Physics, Mechanics, Thermody-
namics, Electricity and Magnetism, l
The Electron Theory. Mathematics of
Alternating Currents, General-Chem—
istry, Quantitative Analysis, and Dr—
ganie Chemistry: Other courses specil-
ly recommended by technical schools in
preparation for engineering are: French
, German or Spanish, Modern Euro-
pean History, United States History.
Psychology. Economics. Political
Science, Business Administration, Pub—
lic Speaking and English. Such stud-,

Crreck, two years: German or French,

two years; Mathematics or Science,

one year; History including English
and American constitutional history,
two years; and psychology. For the
three-year predegal course, additional
work in history. natural science, philos-
oplry, political science, economics, and
sociology is suggested. The [wolyettl
course fulﬁlls the requirements at Col—
iiell, Iowa. Kansas, Michigan, Miss—
curl, and Wisconsin, while the three-
year course, is required at Northwe
sin and Columbia. There is n ten-
dency to increase these requirements
and to prefer the students who have
taken more college work than the mini—
mum.

Crirrrrell't Pro—Legal Courses

Giiirnell was the first college to eru-
phasize political science as a college
study. Professor Macy’s and Pro»
fessor Gannaway's books on the sub—
ject are the standard college text books,

The recognized position or the Clcpall-

merits of history. political science, busi-

ness administration, economics, sociolo-
gy, public speaking and English makes

Grinnell's preparation for technical

law courses nationally recognized and

distinctively desirable.

The courses give exactly the trai
irrg that the social worker needs. Oth-
er courses, invaluable to the social
worker will be found iii the depart-
ments of education. psychology, phil-
osophy, history, political science, busi-
ness administration, English literature
and creative composition, and the mod-
errr languages. The complexity of mod-
ern life requires that the training of a
social worker be broad and versatile.

The many dematids upon a intnis-
ter of the present day are such that
a liberal arts education is necessary in
order that he may prepare himself for
the frrllest service. Grinnell's Contri-
butrorr to religious work indicates the
wonderful incerritive and the splendid
training received by her studeiiis. Miri—
isters, missionaries, Y. M. C. A. arid

forcefully,

Grinnell's courses in commercial
subjects are intended to prepare for
in: iiess, f r graduate study in busi-
ncss adm' stratron. arid tor the work
of those large corporations or govern-
mental departrnents that prefer to con—
dtict their own schools for the techni—
cal training of qualiﬁed college grad—
uates. While general study of busi-
ness is valuable to all students, the
technical training of business adminis-
tration is very diverse. The recogtri
led efficiency of Grrnnoll's Work i
English, the modern languages.‘ his-‘-
tory. and business prepares the student
for the consul - service and foreign
business activities. A man who wish~
es to prepare for banking, salesman—
ship, irrsurance. accounting. or the or—
ganization and administration of busi—
lrress finds at Griirnell work suited to
his needs.

When these courses are studied in
connection with liberal arts. a man
galils not only his technical training
biit he has a cultural background that
ﬁts him for positions of responsibility
and influence in his community. This
cultural training puts him on a footing
with other educated men so that his
(ideas will receive serious attention. He
lhas learned community interests and
can express himself so clearly that he
becomes an efficient leader.
