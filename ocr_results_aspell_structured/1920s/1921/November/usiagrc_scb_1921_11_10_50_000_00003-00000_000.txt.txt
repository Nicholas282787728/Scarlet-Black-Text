Democracy Now in Actual Operation—Council Thor-
oughly Representative.

“The ‘Grinnell Democracy‘ we talk so much about, is being put into actual operation,” said C. L.
Hulsizer, 1900, Chairman of the Graduate Council. “TWO recent developments,” said the Des Moiues
prove my point: the unusual interest and activity of the alunnli in the Graduate Council, and

alumnus,
the splendid cooperation given us by the Board of Trustees.”

The Graduate Council is a thoroughly democdatic organization,
upon the Council through a carefully Workcd out elective System. Each Alumni Association ill the United
States elects one of its members to the Council, which consists of twenty such representatives and nine

ex-officio.

The council, which serves as a point of contact between Grilinellians
and their Alma Mater. is actively engaged in advancing the interests of Grin-
llell through the following standing committees: Finance, Publicity, Alumni

Organizations, and Undergraduate Interests.
This fall, at the request of the Faculty Athletic Committee, which has con-
trol of athletic affairs, there has been organized a special Advisory Athletic
Committee.
The’most active point in the Council is the Executive Committee which
‘ is composed of the Chairman of the Council, the Chairmen of the smnding
committees, the President of the College, and e representative of the faculty.

“The executive committee," said Mr. Hulslzer, “has been invited to meet

felt this to he not only a complimentary recognition or what we are attempt—
ing tto do, but even more a real opportunity to cooperate for the up-buiiding
of Grinnell.” \

"I know of no similar situation in any college in this country, and 1 reel

in the alumni. We have a. new and added responsibility. It is a great step

forward in democracy and cooperation, and I am sure that every Grinnellian
will feel an added interest and responsibility in the college because of the
conﬁdence in us which the Trustees have thus shown."

The system of monthly-joint meetings was inaugurated last July and {our

meetings have been held, two in Des Moines and two in Grippell. Attendance
or both committees has been unusually large, and trustees and graduates agree
that the experiment has producd not only the closest of cooperation but nu—
merous practical and worth while results.

Crgllu'cd under a Greek name!

r lily the gist time that the Enge

tween Chinese students and a. Greek
letter fraternity. occurred some time
ago thn a band or the toi'inm‘ cou-
suited a company of manufacturing
fraternity jewelers ul Detroit, and
asked that their club name, "Chinese
Studcnis’ Club,” be duly translated
into Greek and the letters, C. s, 0.
used on an official fraternity badge.

It was explained to the committee
that such a title would have little
meaning and that it was customary
to use the initials of speciﬁc Greek
words in forming a Greek name. new
to translate "Chinese students Club"
in Greek, however, ‘ives a problem not
easily solved. The Words "student"
and “club" were easily changed to the
Greek equivalents, but not so the
“Chinese."

Search was made in the public li—
brary fur the Greek word for "Chi-
ilese" but without success. In dcs.
peration, Gus, the restaurant man
down the street, was consulted but
his modern Greek could not rise to
the occasion and he cdmitted reluc-
Lantly that he knew no suitable equi
rcleut ror "Chinese" in his native
tongue.

A ﬁnal appeal was made to the lang-
ilage department or the Detroit col-
lege. The head of the Greek depart—
lnent was pressed into service and
asked to help in ﬁnding the missing

vwol'd for the new Greek letter tra-

ternity. He declared at the outset
that there apparently was no word tor
“Chinese" in classic Greek since the
ancient Hellenes sppcrently had no
deﬁnite knowledge of China. Howev-
ei‘, it was found, reference was Inzde
in their literature to “the people of
the tar East” and for this group, the
professor could turpish zi Greek name.
or course, the word 'was immediate’
ly adopted and shortly after the Amer—
can college world became acquainted
with a. new American Chinese Greek
letter fraternity.

ANNAUNBEMENTS MADE HEEAHUINE
NEW ALUMNI MERIT SAHAEAHSHIP

Cover Full Tuition—Now Awarded on Basis of
Scholarship, Character, Leadership
And Outside Activities.

C. L. Hulsizcl‘, 1900, Chairman of tlle Graduate Council, has made
all announcement regarding the new Alumni Merit Scholarships which
will be Welcome news to every Grinnelljan—student, ex—student, or
graduate.

“We have ﬁnally gotten the Alumni Merit Scholarships on such a.
sound basis ﬁnancially and in other ways, that a public statement can
be made about them, ” Mr. Hulsizer then outlined the method and the
basis of award.

The Alumni Merit Scholarships are awarded originally to high school
graduates. Recipents who show themselves worthy will be awarded scholar—
ships after their freshman year, but the purpose or these scholarships is to
attract the strongest high school men—just as the Rhodes Scholarships to
secure on Oxford the best of American college med.

The scholarships are for full tuition,

tivities. Thlls it is the "allval'ound" man who is sought. Mr. Hulsizer pointed
out that it was this type of mail who generally chose Grinnbll, and that the
sbularships would merely be helping such lneen to attain their ambition.
Application cannot be made by the candidate himseif.

one of whom must be a Grinnellian. Additional
references are required, as Well its detailed. information regarding the candh
date. Applications must be passed upon by both
mittce and the Faculty Scholarship committee.

"There are several of these scholarships held by men now in college,”
said Mr. Hulsizer, "but the fact that we will have a. few more for the coming
year has led us to make this announcement.” .

There will he about thirty next year. They are supported by the Loyalty
Endowment Fund, Which is produced by a large number of alumni who gave
regularly each year in amounts varying from $1 to $100. A large part of
the Loyalty Endo\vment»\vhich, by the way, has nothing to do with the

present Endowment campaign is speciﬁcally designated for the Alumni Merit
Scholarships. ‘

Mr. Hulslzer said,
