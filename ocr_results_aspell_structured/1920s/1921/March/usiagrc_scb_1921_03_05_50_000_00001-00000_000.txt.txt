Birthday Flirty Success

The birthday party held by the His-

Main‘s home Wednesday netted the
endowment fund $120.77. It is thought

with Coe, Thursday, winning on the
local floor by a unanimous vote, and
losing at Cedar Rapids by a two to
one ballot. The question was, Re-

solved; That European innuigi-ationl

into the united States should he prov
hibited by law for a period of two
years. The decision of the judges here
was a popular one, for the three men
representing Griniiell completely oute
closed their opponents. Especially in
delivery and technique was this an

. parent.

The/affirmative Grinoell team, cone
sisting of Kelly, Hicks, and ‘Van Horn
debated in Grinncll against the Coe
negative team composed of Jackson.
Laurie, and Joslin. liloyer, Henry
Vogler, and Harshbarger, represented
Griuncll at Cedar liapids against
Coe‘s affirmative team made up of
Parker, Rail, and Bleakley. An one
usually large crowd of between three
and four hundred townspeople and
students formed an enthusiastic
audience at Coe and rendered
excellent support to both teams.
The debate was hotly cone
tested and a good one. thruout, Coe
winning the decision on argument.
while Grinnell had the advantage in

Edellvery.

Reduction to Low )Iiiu‘uium
Kelly, in opening the debate hero
resented the definition of the queSA

‘tion as held by the affirmative to he

a reduction of immigration to the
lowest'practicable minimum, and not
an absolute prohibition. He then proe
ceede to show that economic condi
tions prevalent in our country necese
sitatc such a measure, Jackson of
Cue, in turn. made the claim that the
existing conditions of unemployment
and immigration were gravely exag:
geratcd, supporting his contention by
a lengthy list of authorities. In the
ai'ﬁmaative's second constmctive
speech, Hicks declared that immigrae
tion must be prohibited to safe-guard
American institutions, to Americanize
the aliens already here, and to pre
vent a lowering of the standard of liv
mg. Laurie, next speaker in opposir
tion, devoted much of his time to the
raising of technicalities, and contin~
uing, asserted that there is no virtue
in a two year period, that the measure
Droposed by the affirmative is to dras-
tic, and that there is a real demand
for labor in American industrial cenr
ter.s
Expect Large Increase

Van Dorn, concluding the case of
the affirmative again claimed that the
two year period of prohibition was
necessary to provide ample time for
the erecting of the machinery necess-
ary to cope with the immigration
question. Josh'n, lusl'spenker for the
negative, stood hea’d and shoulders
above his colleagues in the ability to
get his ideas across. Deploring the
prohibition of immigration as an un-
justified change in our nation's his»
tory, he proposed several remedial
measures, and concluded with the
statement that the situation was one
doubtedly self-corrective, since, fol-
lowing a period of depression, such
as now exists, European immigration
to the United. States has always fallen
off.

Jackson, first speaker in rebuttal
for the negauve, was followed by
Kelley, who set up the case of the
opposition and then proceeded to neat»
ly squash each individual point con»
taincd in it. Laurie, Hicks, and Jo
lin followed, each debating the ques—
tion of superiority of authority. Van
Doru rounded out the debate for

Grinnell in excellent shape, and few

were surprised when the chairman.

Gosh! How The Boys
Did Battle This
Morning!

A trio of rari , .tearin' hatfests

marked the opening this morning of,
the inter-dormitory indoor baseballl
tourney. Smith Hall walloped Lan-
gah. Building Four trampcd on child
ing Three, and the Sixites staged a
track meet against Clark Hall.
. Smith ran up the highest count of
the morning, annihilating Laugan to
the tune of so to s. The only feature
of the contest, aside from the slaugh-
ter itself, was the fact that the play
was halted to allow the Smithites to
change shoes, the tugs in which they
appeared having become too hot irom
constant use.

Four sprung the surprise of the a.
m.. in winning handily from Three,
15 to 3. Now the inmates of Four
are of a gentle nature, tending more
toward parlor sports with the co—eds
than the more virile of manly sports,
hence the amazement of the onlooking
multitude when they vanquished the
more robust and hewhiskered Threes.

The funeral of Clark 27 to s at the
hands of the denizens of Six was en-
tirely expected, especially by the six:
ltes themselves. There is a rumor
on the campus that whenever the six-
ites want to sleep the. Clark boys want
to organize a jazz band and when the
condition is reversed the Slxltea al-
ways unlirnber the Barber-shop Sex—
tette and hunt for the Lost Chord.
Hence there is no love lost, and both
layouts fought sullenly. Six simply
was too slick.

Until Final Gun' Ends
Hard Battle.

,Clearly outplayiug the Plkers throug-
out the contest but exhibiting sad in
ability to count their shots. the Pro
iiccis barely nosed out the Washing-
Lton crew in a rugged, rough baskets
ball game last night, 19 to 17.

The play started fast llud clean.
with Grinnell completely outclassing
Ithe \l tois. Eeiiz scored'fil's‘t liom
the foul line, but Fearing and White—
hill missed easy field shots, Wash-
iziglon, mainly as a result of Thomp—
sun's ability to count from the foul
line, passed the Pioneers and took a
two point lead.

Grinnell soon took the lead again
uheii Benz went‘ wild. The Pioneers
excelled the Pikers in floor work,
taking the boil under the ring time
and again, but Whitehill was‘ unable
to cage several short tries. As a re-
suit the score was practically- even
until near the end of the period, when
13an broke loose for his fourth field
basket. The half ended with the
count 10 ,to 7, Benz having counted
all the Pioneer points.

Players Get Rough
In the second period the contest
waxed rough, Referee Dornholdt fail-
ing to keep the game well ip hand.
Thuinscr, Piker center, counted a trio
of baskets from the field whichpu't
the visitors in the lead, while Grin~
nell continued to miss casy‘ shots.
With Washington in the lead, 17 to
14, local fans began to worry consid-
erably, but Fearing counted a ringer
‘while going at full speed and brought
the Pionecis within striking distance.
Captain Evans, injected into the fray
in Whitchill’s place, announced his
presence by two baskets and Fearing
again counted, putting the Pioneers
ahead. There they remained until the
final sup.
‘llenz is Still:

The game was not it pretty one to

watch. The passing of both fives was
often erratic, and neither counted at
fair percentage of their open shots at
line hoop, but in this department Grin-
nell appeared by far the weakest.
Much nastiness went on behind Dom—
holdt's back which also detracted
considerably from the contest. It was
by for the roughest battle seen here
this season.
"Freddie" Benz wastag‘ain the Pio~
neer star, counting all the Grinnell
points in the first period and playing
strongly throughout. Fearing also
showed a strong flour game, but had
hard luck on his shots.

Thumser and Captain Kraehe look—
ed best for the Pikers, Thumsor's
dribbling and passing were excellent,
and be counted three baskets from
scrimmage, while Kraehe was strong
