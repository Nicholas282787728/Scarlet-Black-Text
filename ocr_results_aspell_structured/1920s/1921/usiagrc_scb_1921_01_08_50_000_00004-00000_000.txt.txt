established a Research Information
Service as a general clearing—house

lo and industrial research. This “Ser-
vice" on request supplies information
concerning research problems, pro-
gress, laboratories, equipment, meth-
ods, publications, personnel, funds.
etc. .

Ordinarily inquiries are answered

without charge. When this is impos-
sible because or unusual difficulty in
securing information. the inquirer is
notiﬁed and supplied with an estimate
of cost.
Much of the intoimation assembled

carried them through the 1920 season

GIRLS ADOPT NEW
CONDUCT RULING'

Massmeeting Held Thursday To
Clarify Faculty Views.

That every girl must sign a card
placed on her floor every evening at
10 o'clock to insure that the League
Board may know where she is, was
the new ruling adopted by the girls
at a mass meeting held Thursday ev-
ening. It had been thought for some
time that some method should be adop—
ted to know whether the girls were in
or not and to make those who stay
out in town one evening get permis-
sion, because there has been difficulty
in past years in locating girls when
telegrams, etc, came.

Four years ago the faculty decided
to grant six allscollege dances on the
campus on condition that the students
never have any down town dances.
This ruling- was read so that there
should be no misunderstanding about
attending K. P. dances the night be
fore school opened, because as soon
as the student feaclles Grinnell, vaca-
tion ends and the college is held rc-
sponsihie.

In order to insure better attendance
at Vespers, the girls voted that certain
cottages be held responsible for being
there once in three weeks. Somers,
Central, and Cottage V are to go in a
body next Sunday; and lllears and Cut-
tage IV; Cottages 11 and Ill the for
lowing Sunday.
