the Middle West by storm, a diniiily
little souah, who-signed on the col-
lege register as Eoku Long, tell in
love with Handy Bandy. And he tell‘,
in Love with her. (The capital is1
necessary, for he was the crazier).

From his name- one would imagine'

Being in a curious mood, I asked
my best girl the other night where
she was vaccinated. It was a naughty
thing to do, porhaps, but she didn't
slap my time.

Instead, she leaned over to me so
that her hair brushed against my face
in a most tantalizing manner, and
with a suggestive look in her eyes,
said sweetly, "What do you want to
know for?"

I was rather taken aback by the
sudden attack but I began, "So I
could—"

“Listen," she interrupted. “I was
vaccinated in the doctor‘s office."
