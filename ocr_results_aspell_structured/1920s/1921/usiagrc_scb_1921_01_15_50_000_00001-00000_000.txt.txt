LINCOLN, Nebr., Jan. 14—Grinnell
college basketeers went down to de-
test before the strong Nebraska Uni-
versity that here tonight in a. fast,
well-played contest, 31 to 10.

The Huskers, who possess nu lili-
usually strong aggregation this sea-
son, have been exhibiting a high stan-
dard of tewulny for several weeks,
having a. shade the advantage of the
illinois five in a two-game series
played a iorthight ago. Tonight they
Kayo an excellent imitation of a
smooth—working machine of five
parts, and the visitors could not stop
them.

Grinnell also started out by exhib-
iting smooth-working templay, and
battled the Huskers Drnctically even
,Eor Lhe first ten minutes when the
count was 9 to 6 in the latter's favor.
Thereafter, howevcr, they showed
lpeed only in ﬂashes.

Official Opening

The contest, which was the opening
Missouri Valley game for both t‘lves.
was replete with ceremony. It fea»
tured the dedication of the Cornhusk-
up new basketball floor at the Coli-
aanm of the fair- grounds, and s
crowd of 2,000, about 100 of whom
were members of the state legislature,
witnessed the battle. Governor Mc-
Kelva of this state tossed up the ball
to start the game amid the blinding
flare of flashlight cartridges.

Tha gama itselt was wall-played
and hard»fought, although the Husk-
ers' victory was decisive. Tha Nee
braskans had amassed a safe lead at
the end of the first half, and from
that point on were never within the
danger zone. Smith, Husker forward,
was the scoring star of the game with
five field ringers, although Eekius,
center, counted three from the field
and tossed fouls with commendable
accuracy. Fearing wits high scorer
\lur Gl'inuell with a brace of baskets,
and the Pioneers were able to make
no addition to their score through
fouls because the Huskers suffered
only two penalties during.the entire
contests.

The Grinncll aggregation appeared
Capable of good basketball during the
opening minutes of the game, and it
is the opinion of the writer that to-
morrow night's contest will he a clo
or one than the opener. Coach Sher-
man of the visitors said tonight that
his squad will reach Grillnell Sunday
morning at eight o’clock on the re-

Kelley presented and explained the

and to set a record for other classes

Mr. Lovell spoke, as he said, not
from the point of View of one of the
professors, but as a ,member- of the
college who had been part of Griunell

that of the students was that he had
