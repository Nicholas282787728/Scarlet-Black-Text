With only two woi ing days left
before the Drake Relays the Pioneer
1 track men are taking advantage of the
fair weather and are putting on the
final touches before the starter calls
them to their mar-ks on Saturday Mr
tsruuon, Coach Huff's men lost seve
eral days of valuable time on account
of the frigid weather of last iveek end
and as a result he is having a hard
tinre to determine who will run on
the various relay teams.
Entries Uncertain
Thc pioneer coach has been scri-
ously hampered by the ineligibility of
men and also by the loss of one of
his mainstays in the short relay team.
It is easily seen that slich losses com»
pletely upset his plans for the build-
ing of his teams and that he has to
rebuild his squad with the best pos
sible results. However, in spite of the
- fact that of the men ivho are entered
at Drake only three are veterans.
campus opinion is firm in its belief
that Grinnell will finish well.
Although the writer cannot state
defin ch as to who will compose the
teams from the workouts during the
past two weeks it looks as if the half

relay the men ivill probably he Bryan,

Independence of the Philippine
Islands Subject Chosen for
Annual Prep Event,

May 4 and 11 have been announced
as the dates for the annual freshman
inter-society debates, which will be on
the question “Resolved: that the Philr
ippinc Islands should be given their
independence immediately.” Work on
the debates is progressing slowly, ac-
cording to statements made by the
various society presidents yestcrday.

Although all the details are not
available as to the personnel of the
teams, it is certain that Institute will
be represented by one team, consist-
ing of Cloiis, Scott, Francis and Mc-
Grath, which will debate both sides
.of the question. For-ours negative
team opposing Institute will be com-
posed of Porter,
son, while Mitchell, Mollratli and
Cam will uphold the affirmative for
Fcririii against Ionian.

The teams representing Clri-esto
have not yet hccn picked, but it is
certain that they will be chosen from
the following men Hawk, Har-nagle,
Fleck, Barber, Brierly, Ellis and Eng
Loi'f. So far Ionian has picked only
one team, consisting of stehu, ha
croft and Stock, but there is a no
bility that they will choose another
lteam.

The debates will be judged by incin-
bers or the faculty. The freshman
series was won last year by Foriiirr,
which was represented by a single
team debating both sides or the ques-
lion.

ment with regard to the progress

"The women’s campaign for tho
College Endowment Fund is develop-
ing very satisfactorily. A large ma
jority of the thirty or more women's
organizations of the city have already
made pledges, others are considering
the question. Soon a list will be pub
lished of the clubs pledging and the
amount subscribed by each. The
women are working together splen—
didly and we are confident of reach—
ing our goal of $10,000 before July
1st. Aside from helping two or three
or even more clubs to earn pledges
many of our women are giving indi-
vidually. making the total sum given
by Gl'innell women far above cutout),
"The Community Bazaar which will
he held May 4 and 5 will be the first
combined effort of the women to raise
money for their pledges. other plans
will be formed later until every group
that has pledged will be able to meet
its payments. The first organization
to reach its goal is the "Read and Re-
flect Club." This is a group of elder»
ly ladies and they have their subsol'ipr
tions all in."
