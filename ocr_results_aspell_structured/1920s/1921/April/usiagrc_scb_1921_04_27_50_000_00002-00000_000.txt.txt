A DEMOCRACY

M1. Harvey lngham, editor of The
Des Moines Register, said in a speech
before the convention of the Iowa Cole
lege Press Associattou recently, that
the American college is the most
democratic institution in the world

views are directly opposite.

One of the main functions of a col—
lege is to introduce the students to
the world in general and to provide
an exchange or views, customs, and
ideas. Most people agree that the ac-
tual technical class- 1oom knowledge
obtained while in residence at a lalge
school of lea1ning, is only one of the.
indirect results that o student all»

perience of meeting people, of learir

of history, and of philosophy, but ad

take part in the world's program.

One of the great things about the
educational system is that it does not

is done in most colleges to make it
