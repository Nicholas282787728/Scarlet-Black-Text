PURPLE SHOULD BE STRONG

’l‘uclve Letter )[l-ll From UlllM'ntﬂl
Team Makes Ulmwll .\ll|lNIl'
Fornlitlllllle on Paper.

“Vith the approach of the Cornell
same at Mount Vernon, Saturday,
coaches Hylnnd and Black are core
rooting the had spots in the play last
week against Penn. A defense for
aerial attacks is one of the major
problems. The Pioneer backs show-
ed up rather poorly in their attempts
to knock down the Quaker aerial har—
rage. Monday afternoon the local
high school squad acted as a dummy
for the instruction in defensive play
agsinst the passing game.

After the 20-7 defeat which the
Purple warriors handed the Pioneers
last year, the locals have no intention
that anything like that should hap-
nen again. This will be Cornell's in-
itial game of the season so there is
much speculation as to her strengrn.
However, a dozen letter men of last

, year's undefeated team are again on

the sqllad‘nnd there is every reasol’r‘i

to believe that another powerful
eleven will represent the Purple this
fall. Captain Dean at quarter, Hoop-
er at full and Gray at halfback, with
Greene, who piloted the learn two
ycars ago, form the nucleus of the
backfield conibinstion. Knsch/Iadanl-
son, Rceck, Hinnniel, Lamp and
'rruckenrniller are all linemen of ex-
porience,

1t sccnis likely that the same lino-
up will start the same that took the
‘field against Penn. However, as the
week progresses there is a good
chance for several of the reserves to
displace the r ulo

Plans [or Grlnnells third annual
Homecoming, which takes place Sat—
iii-dsy,,October 24, are about to be
formulated by a general Homecoming
Comlnittecvwhich \lill be called as
soon as possible, probably this week,
and will represent all the chief inter-
ests of undergraduates, facility and
alumni, i .i

The gopcral plan of making the day
an all-college celebration centering
on the football game in the afternoon
will be followed, although no details
have been settled as to the events of
morning, afternoon, and evening with
[he erceptlon of the gum with Drake.
Lost year‘s program consisted of the
pep—meeting and play on Friday ever
ding, a freshman football game Sate
urday morning, the Ames game Sate
urdoy afternoon, and the varsity din-
her; dance, and reunions in the eve-
ping.

Since a recital already has been
scheduled for Friday evening it is
possible that the homecoming play
may be omitted, as general sentiment
in the past has favored so evening of
sociability for the homecoming VISA
itcrs. The combination of Pioneer
Day with Homecoming has been sug-
gested, with a parade in the morning
similar to that held on Pioneer Day
last spring. Many classes now hold
sessions Saturday morning and the
permission of the faculty must be ob-
tained in order to use the morning for
port of the Homecoming program.

With fair Weather it is probable
that the number of visitors will ex-
ceed all past’ records. Last year's
Homecoming drew a. larger crowd
than Commencement. With Drake as
the visiting team this year, with a
long string of victories to her credit.
on attendance of four or five thousand
at the football game is considered
Possible. '

As the opening grime of the season.
the Pioneers handed the Penn college
eleven a 27-13 beating on the local
field last Saturday. In a slow but
ever certain mariner, Hyland’s men.
smashed their way to a touchdown in
each quarter only to sinkerl towards
the close of the game and permit the
Quakers to complete two fol-ward
passes for touchdowns.

The score is not indicative of the
strength of the tWo elevens for the
Oskaloosa lads were unable to penc-
trate the Grinnell forward wall .With
any consistency until substitutions
had effected practically the entire
second team lineup. The local back~
field with Capt. Sweet, Wing and lihoF
an altermtiuﬁ on line plunges and
end I‘ll‘rls proved a speedy outfit, one
to be \vorthily respected by any
Missouri valley eleven. this fall. In.
the line Martin, Carl and Seeland
showed up exceptionally Well al-
though the entire team play was
commendable for early season. At
times the locals looked like a mid~
season aggregation; then again the
Quakers would sift through to throw
the hacks for slight losses or to rush
hunts.

runu Fights Goiucly

Captain Raftety ..at fullback 'and
Haynes and Quirc, Center and right
cud respectively, bore the bulwark of
the Penn attack but die whole team
fought it plucky battle against It

, heavier and speedier eleven.

The first quarter consisted mainly
of a sees-hiring of the teams up and
down the field with Moran of Grin~
hell and leuhl of Penn exchanging
punts quite evenly. As the Pioneers
smashed the line the right side of
the Quaker for“ id wall began to
weaken and after a. steady march.
'down the field Sweet slipDEd through
left tackle for the first touchdown of
the season. Moran placekicked for
the extra point.

The second period found Mum and
”Moran again engaged in o panting
diml. Mimi’s punt on his own 40
Yard line was blocked and Sweet re-
covered fol' Grihnell. After a preny
22 yard run by SWeet, Mceter was
substituted in his place. Meeter
smashed his way to a‘ touchdown, at-
so kicking goal,

Ounkers Shirt Passing

The second half Started off with
tho Quakers opening up a. barrage of
pzsscs which were unsuccessml.
Muhl and Meeter carried on the punt-
irlg dual With a slight edge in Meet~
er's favor. Seelond broke through
the Penn line to block and recover
Muhl's kick on the Penn 5 yard line.
Meeter slipped through for the third
touchdown, also kicking goal.

In the fourth quarter the Quakers
pulled themselves together and un—
lashed an aerial attack which proved
too formidable for the Pioneer re~
serves. After a. successful pass.
liluhl to Quire, iluhl heaved another
to Daniels who sprinted across the
goal line for Penn's first score, Dan-
iels added the extra. point hy a place—
kiok. As play resumed, Muhl tossed
a long puss to Ouire who romped .
down the field 70 yards for a. touch—
down. thhl failed to kick goal. BY

Sweet and Moran advanced the hall
to Penn's 10 yard line where Moran
