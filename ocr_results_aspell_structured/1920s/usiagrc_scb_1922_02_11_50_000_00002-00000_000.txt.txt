“THE COLLEGE WORKSHOP”

The college man has been the tars
get, during the past several years, for
all manner of accusations and be has
been frequently assailed by charges of
inefficiency, of being impractical, and
of feeling himself above his less for--
tunate brother-s. In short, anybody
who could coin a new phrase
bodying the ideas of tortoise shell

cru-

glasses, long locks, and a volume of
blank. verse, felt that he was qualiﬁed
to preach the gospel of reform among
the colleges and universities of the
country. Part of this criticism has
undoubtedly been justiﬁed. Much of
it, in fact, has been the product oi
experience. Particularly has this been
the case with the material in the more
moderate publications, which are stri—
ving to discover the actual situation
in the educational ﬁeld. In this con-
nection, many men of wide evpel-lence
and of real wisdom hdve Written str-
ticles concerning the present day col-
lege and suggesting programs of res
form.

of the men who have recently dis
cussed the college question, President
Richmond, of ‘Union College WI‘ ing
in} the Outlook, hits submitted one of

the simplest but one of the most start- I

ling theories that has yet come to
lightl In speaking of the necessity for
getting back to work and or the mis-
interpretation thao is olten given the
.term “work” in the modern college,
he saysb

"There is no reason why a boy who
comes to college should expect an
easier time than a. boy who goes to
work in a factory or in an office. The
idea that in coming to college a boy
is postponing his life work for four
years while he floats down the stream
of nine. untroubled by the hard re
alities of life that other young men
have to face, is 'not at all our idea of
what a. college means. Neither is a
college a kind of intellectual incuba—
tor where young fledglings are hatch~
ed out with no effort of their own. A
college is a workshop and it it is go—
ing to maintain its place in the es-
teem of the nation that has supported
it with such undiluted generosity, we
must see that the gospel of honest
work is not only taught in the college
but practiced by all or us who have
anything to do with it.”

President Richmond's
are the result of a number of yenrs,
of practical experience as head of a
college and of intimate contact with
college students who are supposedly
preparing themselves for a life voca-
tion. What he has found to be true in
Union College is undoubtedly to a
great degree true in other institutions
all over the country, for there is really
very little difference in educational
methods'and in students, regardless

ills theory is startling to many or

us, perhaps, when we consider the

masons for coming to college. ch
oi the many inch and woman ill the
universities or the country realize the
meaning of a college as it is rlclillotl

l’ul ll eve hotly would agree with blur

cllt Richmond.

and, students scclu urrrtcd in a boiler
that somc sort of change rs necessary
if the college or the university is to
maintain its standard.

Whatever the reaction to the pres
ent criticism of our institutions and
our educational system, this critrcisur
will serve at least one purpose and
that is to bring about an investiga-
tion of conditions and a possible 507
lution of present problems. whatever
the basis of the attacks upon college
men and colleges, a thorough self in-
ventory might do much to adjust the
problem for each individual.

“PROFESSIONALISM”

The wave of “professionalism" that
has recently swept the athletic cir-
cles of the Big Ten schools, has reach-
ed the crest there and spread into
the Missouri Valley conference and
others and seems to be making the
rounds . Everywhere there is invesr
tigatioo and drastic action and few
schools seem to remain untouched by
the hand of the al‘cllreneiny of ulnar
teur sports. '

The University of Nebraska is the
first Valley school to be affected and
has thus far lost two men thr-u the
investigation being conducted _ there.
As a result, the Nebraska coach has
outlined a plan which might be effec»
tive in the prevention of "professions
alism" in amateur circles in the fu-
ture. This proposed campaign is an
embodiment of the "honor system.”
Upon entering a school the student
and prospective athlete would sign a
statement that be had never played
professional sports of any type and
that during his connection with the
institution be pledged himself to re!
ceive no pay for athletic serviccs ren-
del‘ed.

Such a plan u-oud fail to completely
eliminate "professionalism.” As long
as we have inter-collegiate sports and
athletic contests of increasing impor-
tance, judging - by public interest
shown in them, we will he handicaps

soil physical skill. However, while

To the Editor, Scarlet and Black:—

An article which appeared in your
"What Do You Think" column in the
issue for Feb. 8 caused me some great
mental agony at ﬁrst but this later
turned to sincere sympathy for the
writer—not sympathy for his attitude
but sympathy for his unbalanced
thinking.

In speaking of the- Grinnell Spirit,
stomach aches, tumors, and athletics.
the erter certainly must have con<
centrated on this that so hard and
consistently that be contracted either
one of the aches or tumors. Athletics
plays an important in creating the
Grinnell Spirit but it is by no means
the entire creating element. I will
try to take up briefly the diagnosis of
the "case” as analyzed by the writer.

1. The scholarships as offered by
the trustees thru the Graduate Coun—
all are not for the athletes but for
anyone who proves himself worthy.
True, some athletes are favored with
these scholarships but in my experiv
ences with‘crinnell several times i
have seen them revokek because the
holders were found unworthy. So if
the athletes receive some percentage
of these scholarships, let us remember
that it has berm passed an by men
who have been deemed worthy of se—
lecting men for silifl scholarships.

2. "Athletes receive favor at the
hands of the administrationi" How
visible is the stomach ache in dos
statement. what does the writer
want from the administration per»
sonall . Goodenow Hall or the Con—
gregatiorlal Church? Sorry. I'm afraid
they can’t deed them to you at pres-
ent. Yet perhaps they might give you
special consideration. Seriously, 1
don't believe that any place in the
middle west7 '95, in the United States
are athletic rules more stringent than
in Grinnell and rightfully so. . The
scholastic standards at it school must
assuredly cannot be put down to a
standard of athletics but athletics
must be built up to the standard of a
school. .

The writer spoke of preference of
Jobs to the athlete, 0f the jobs that
are available at the college, 13% are
held by athletes and 37% are
held by non-participants in any branch
of athletics.

why shouldn't the athlete have some
consideration? He takes part in the
contests, he practices three to four
hours a day, he is denying himself
much in training to reach the highest
point in physical etflcieocy. Remem-
ber Mr. Genius, that he is not doing
this for himself alone but rather for
you and for the body of students, for
the alumni, and to put the school in
a :evorable light before those who
are yet to come. it cannot be denied
that to the blood of the American
youth athletic contests are truly worth
while. If crinnelt with her high scol-
astfc standing, can produce favorable
athletic teams, it is undeniably a real
advertising asset The writer of the
article appearing in the last issue
rather implied that the Grlnnell ath»
lete is below the mental average. He
pointed to the men who were really
worth while and picked on such men
as Albert Shaw and Norman Hell. i
personally know that Norman Hall is
Very keenly interested in Grinnell
athletics and Albert Shaw, While once
speaking on "The Modern Artist” ex-
plained how the term was growing
more elastic and very distinctly do I
remember him citing Charles Hoyt as
a real artist in the athletic world and,
added the speaker, he could not be
denied being called an artist any more
than a genius with the brush or sculp-
tol' 01' an engraver.

American young man go on and waste,

l Again, the author of the article did
not mention men who carried them-
selves a place in the scholastic as
well as the athletic worldl Was the
writer aware that William Zeiglcr,
who was a four "G man won the
Rhodes scholarship and that many
men who are Phi Bctft Kappa members
[were very active in athletic events,
Personally, during my four years at
Grimlcll, there was a man in our class
who on graduation was awarded his
Plli Beta may not withstanding the
diet that during his four years he
lhad been very active in outside af-
‘fairs.

l Mr. Sophomore, while 1 was in
lschool, and surely the principle has
not changed completely, I was always
able to ﬁnd work and found work to
‘pay for my room and board and,
while I nev& received a scholarship.
I always found the college adminisA
tratlorr more than glad to extend a fa—
vor concerning payment if I was a
little hard pressed.

You spoke of genius as the man who
participates in athletics is only a be<
log of brutal strength and a' few of
you men who are studious and striv—
ing to better the school are, I sup-
,pose, being imposed upon. You spoke
of the Grlnuell Spirit to which you
may have been exposed but it never
affected you. it is immaterial wheth-
er you pick up your dolls and go
home or not but if you stay your four
