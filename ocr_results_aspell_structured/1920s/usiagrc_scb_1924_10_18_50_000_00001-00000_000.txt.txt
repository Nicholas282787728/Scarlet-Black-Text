on Defense This Year.

when Grinnell and Drake clash in
Des Moines today, it niil he the best
chance the Pioneers have had in years
to beat the Bulldogs.

The dope gives the two teams more
or all even hrcak tltan ever hetero
Each team has played two games, and
while Grlnncll lost her initial colltcst,
it is generally conceded even in the
Drake camp, that the Pioneer team of
today is not the team tllat appeaml
against Cornell.

Billlthlgs Need nitvllpr

Both teams are in the host of con—
dition, and botil‘ have hackiields that
compare iarorahly with any in the
Missouri Valley conference. The hi

 

gest advantage that Grinnell has is

Bonltcr Jinx to overcome this year.
The farmer Drake luminary tigured
largely in the last three Drake victor»
ies, hut he has been lost through grad—
nation. in 1921, Grimlell had Drake
defeated 10 to o tor three quarters of
the game, because Boelter was on the
sidelines with an injured shoulder,
and an almost helpless arm, hut he
was injected into the game in spite or
his injuries, and raced through the
pioneers for three touchdowns to win
the game. Everett the diminutive
Bulldog hallhack seems to be in line
for Boolter's honors this fall, but he
has not yet had the necessary expel»
ience to make him quite as dangerous
a runner.
An Important )L V. Game

with the deieat oi Nebraska by
Oklahom last week, the game today
takes on an important hearing in the
Missouri valley conference champion-
ship race. Both teams are admitted
by expert dopesters to be dangerous
contenders, and a win for Grinnell ton
day would give the Pioneers the neon
essary coniidence to go through the
rest of the season undeteated. The
