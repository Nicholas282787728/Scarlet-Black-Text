scored a inaiority oi their points as

STUDENT BODY NEXT TO
SHOW LOYALTY SPIRIT

To Discuss Action on Drive in
Town at Meeting of Business
Mon Jan. 21.

That the $40,000 gitt made by the
taculty recently, and the unprecedent-
cd enthusiasm on the part of the stud-
cnt body shown in the past rew weeks
in hehalt of the Gl'nmell endowment
campaign, has done more than any
single event since the campaign was
launched. to arouse the spirit or the
aliiiiini.ivorkei~ and friends of the
movement, was the statement made
today by H, s. llcCowin, general di-
rector of the local Grinnell Movement
ottice.
“In talking with men and women
throughout the state, I have repeat—
edly been asked about work on the
campus, and was unable to say much
in this regard, but alter the wonder-
tul contribution trom the faculty. and
the rebirth of student enthusiasm in
behalt ot the campaign, those inter—
ested in the drive took new stock of
the situation. and work weal! on with
more enthusiasm than ever beiore.
Appreciate Saci-lilcc
“Alumni all over the state are ex-
pressing their appreciation of the fac-
ulty gift. It is an expression of lay—
alty to an institution with which they
have become identified. which has
heretotore been unknown. Realizing
that such a gilt means sacrifice on
the part oi~many, workers have re-
newed their ettorts to keep pace with
such a magnificent example."
Although it will demand much hard
work on the part of all concerned, Mr.
McCowan stated that the prospects
for raising lpnds throughout this part
ot the country are bright. That peo-
ple are taking a new interest in the
campaign alter the showing made on
lthe local campus, seems to show that
‘tbe student action came at the needed
,time. it the campus students succeed‘
‘in coming up‘ to the goal set by the
faculty, it will make a splendid rec-
ord which the endowment workers
can set beiore the people of the state,
according to Mr. McCowun’s state
ment. That the students would do
their part, was assured by statements
or student committee members today,
who expressed contidcnce that the
student body would not fall down at
- ical period.
Town Plnns Pint
What action the city or Grinllell
will take in‘regard to the raising of
the endowment, will be discussed at
a meeting to be held January 21,
which will be addressed by President
Main, l-l, s. McGowan, and others.-
Alumni and incnibeis of local cunt
mer il organizations will attend the
meeting. the place ol'which has not
been announced. Tlic alumni associa—
tion of Council is the largest or any
oi the alumni clubs, and its members
