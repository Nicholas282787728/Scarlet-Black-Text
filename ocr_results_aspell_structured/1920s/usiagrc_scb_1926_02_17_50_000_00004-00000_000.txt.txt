Many Outdoor Meets

Alter the completion oi the indoor
baseball tourney, the assistant man-
ager for the spring athletic events
will direct an out door track meet, a
baseball tournament and a tennis
tournament. The annual indoor
track meet has been discontinued be-
cause of such poor facilities, in the
gym. Possibly a horseshoe tourna-
ment and a golf tournament may be
held although nothing has been defin-
itely decided about these two events.

If the remainder of the intramural
program is to be a success the stud
ents will have to continue their use
operation and turn out tor all the
tournameilts. A successful year in
intramural 'athletics will bring a larg-
er and more extensive program loi-
