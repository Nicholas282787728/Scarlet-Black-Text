To the Editor.

Upon reading Heidi Brumbaugh's
column in the 8&8 last week. i was
struck by several things:

First. Ms Brumbaugh was mistaken
when she indicated that a sergeant was
shot by the Soviets in East Germany. in
[act it was a major. Ma]. Arthur
Nicholson. who was shot by the Soviets.
A sergeant. Sgt, Jessie Schatz, was
traveling with Major Nicholson but [or-
tunateiy he was unharmed. When the
Major was shot, Schatz was arrested
and prevented from rendering ﬁrst aid
of any kind to Nicholson. The Soviets
did not make any attempt to aid their
victim. but rather three different Soviet
generals came to the scene and allowed
Nicholson to die from chest wounds.

Second, Ms. Brumbaugh. while allowA
ing that the Soviets may not have acted
with the most decorum in the Nicholson
affair. contends that Major Nicholson
was spying and that presumably
mitigates Soviet culpability. Ms. Brum-
baugh is quite correct in asserting that
Major Nicholson was spying, but it was.
in tact. legal spying. That is the us,
France. England and USSR, signed
an agreement in 1947 which permits
reconnaissance patrols in East Ger-
many hy the Western Allies and in West
Germany by the U.S.S.R. Thus.
Nicholson was where he was because of
an international agreement. The
Nicholson shooting only serves another
lesson in the Soviet tradition of shooting
first and blaming the other side for
Soviet crimes later.

Third. Ms. Brumbaugh states in her
article that liberals do care about the
incidents such as KAL 007 and she cites

the iormation oi the Committee on Stu-
dent Politics [CSP] as evidence oi
liberals' concern. Ms. Brumbaugh
states that aiter the KAL incident the
CSP was iormed and condemned the
KAL incident. it I was unaware that
CSP was a liberal organization and
thus. any action by the committee could
be attributed to liberals. 2t Ms. Brum-
haugh is mistaken when she said that
the KAL incident was one at the ﬁrst
things examined by CSP. CSP never
discussed the KAL incident. Joint
Board. which can be considered a
liberal group. was the SGA organiza
tion which discussed the incident. Fur»
thermore. an examination oi Joint
Board‘s reaction does not reveal cone
corn [or Soviet misbehavior in regard
to KAL incident. Joint Board did not
condemn the Soviet action; Joint Board
retused to make any oiticial smtement
on the KAL incident. The reason given
was that Joint Board did not want to get
involved in international politics [as op-
posed to Central American issues or
South Atrical. l tail to see Ms. Brumr
baugh's point when she attempts to
demonstrate liberals' concern over
Soviet behavior. Joint Board's handling
oi the KAL aitair only speaks oi the
characteristic liberal silence on Soviet
atrocities.

Last. Ms. Brumbaugh tells us that
because the Us. and U.S.S.R. have dlfr
ierent cultures and historical traditions
our views or the Nicholson shooting are
different. Ms. Brumbaugh relatesa tale
of one Soviet soldier's explosive reacr
tion to Ms. Brumbaugh and her friends

street to illustrate Soviet attitudes
about protecting what little turf they
have control over. when in the
U.S.S.R,, I also found the Soviets very
concerned about jaywalking and other
small rules that we in the [1.5. do not

_ pay much attention to.

I found Ms. Brumbaugh's argument
persuasive enough that l have been me

mon problem oi misperception I
believe that the US, should start to
vigorously enforce jaywalking laws 7
even on outroi-the-way streets. This
would give the Us. an excuse to shoot
Soviet military personnel who are care
rying out internationally agreed upon
activities and leave them to die. The
U.S. would also be able to shoot down
civilian airliners. and liberals in the
U.S.S.R. would write articles in Soviet
newspapers urging the Soviet govern
ment not to over-react because the U.S.
was only acting hostile because of its
cultural values. In short. by strict en-
forcement or jaywalking laivs the (1.5
