Nine Grinnell students were arreSted in Des
Moines Tuesday while participating in a peaceful
protest against the use droid-growth wood by the
Menards retail chain. The protest began at 9 am.
when 16 students from Drake, Grinncll, and the
University of Iowa locked their necks to signs at
the entrance and exit of the Store while over 30
more picketed, passed out leaﬂets, and rccitcd
chants condemningthc consumption otold growth
wood

Des Moines Police ofﬁcers arrived soon after,
as did the Des Molnes media, and protestors were
told to disperse. Those who were not locked down
moved to the Street while the rest remained For sev»
and hours.

The incidenr was part ora national day orac.
tion led by the Ralnforest Acrion Network (RAN).
Twice a year, RAN contacts corporations which it
feels are exploiting the tainforests and asks them to
adopt new policies. Each tall and spring, RAN se.
lects the organization that it feels is the most dc»
structive from the organizations that do not adopt
new policies, contacts activist organizations around
the country, and leads a day ofaction against it.

Over 50 students from a Statewide envitonmen—
tal organization, iowa Students Toward Environ»
mental Protection (Iowa STEP), participated in this
fall's cvcnt, including members ofGtinncll’s chap.
ter ofFree the Planet. This was the third time FTP

was involved in a RAN national day or action but
the ﬁrst time participants were arrested.

Du ke activist group testifies before Senate
Students Against Sweatshops members travel to Washington, D. C.

By Katherine Siroup
The Chronicle (Duke U.)
(UrWiRE) DURHAM N.c, — Four mem-
bers of students Against sweatshops traveled to
Washington, DC, late last week to address the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee er an indica»
riun that thestudenrded and-sweatshop movement
may be gaining some national political clout.
Casey Harrell, Trinity senior and spokesperson
for the delegation, testiﬁed before the committee
as part or its hearings on the International Labor
Organization's Convention on the Worst Forms
ofChild Labor. Tho treaty, adopted unanimously
in June by 11.0 delegates from 174 countries, is
intended to eliminate the exploitation ofchildrcn
through pornography, prostitution, slavery, hazard-
ous wotlt and compulsory military scrvicc.
“it was just a good chance to talk about what

we‘ve been doing here, for one thing, and rise to
talk about somcorthcstruggleswe'rcgoingthrough
right now.“ said Trinitysophomorciustin McBride.

In a ﬁve—minute spetch
prepared collaboratively by the

members used their experi-

industry to illusrrart rhe need
for stringent regulation paired
with a credible rcgularory
mechanism.

“The World Trade Organic

to allocate time to address even the most heinous
orlabor abuses, much less ways to enrorce any stanr

“"It eliminates the worst

abuses. Who's going to

be opposed to that?"

"This exhibits a lack of true commitment to ads
dressing labor abuses worldwide... something which
a convention addressing a topic as narrow as the
