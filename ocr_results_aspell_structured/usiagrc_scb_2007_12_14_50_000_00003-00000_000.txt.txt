scn President Megan Goering ’03s state of the College
address, held last Tuesday evening, entertained about 70 stir
dents who braved the icy weather with a recap ofthc progress
she and her cabinet have made thrs serrrcstcr. Five pots ofsoup
and homemade bread beckoned studcnts to enter. Donations
were also accepted for the Cyclone Sidr rclicfcffoit

Goering talked at length about all of the accomplishments
of SGA this semester and their goals for next year. Most ofthc
information she covered had already been presented to Joint
Board, Still, several new items stood out, including that SGA is
working wrth FM to find a spot for a real ice rink on campus.
Most of her address, however, reeappetl this semester's prior
accomplishments

Ben Good Y10, who follows SGA and Joint Board closely,
enjoyed the speech. “It was very comprehensive, an excellent
overview ofwhnt SGA has done this semester," he said,

Other students who had not followed student government
earlier found the speech informative. "It's definitely hard to
cover a lot of things in detail in that amount of time, but she
did a good job of giving an overview ofwhat’s been going on,"
said Ben schcmpet '11.

After the speech, Goering fielded questions regarding Tom
Crady’s replacement, possible reinstatement of need—blind ad—
missions for international students and the switch to having
two vice presidents this year.

“There is no wayi could possibly do what I do and [56A
Vice President for Student Affairs] in [Koszcwski ’08] does,
ever,” Goerrng said, mentioning that SGA corrld now be repre-
sented at multiple committee meetings simultaneously.

Selfrgovernnnce was also a priority in Gocrrngb speech. She
mentioned the dcstnretion ofearnpus bikes as representative of
the problems with setfagovernancc on campus. "I woke up after
a campus party one morning and Mac Field was a graveyard
of campus bikes" she said to preface a discussion of the ways
SGA is advocating self-governance. ooering added that. in the
search for Cindy’s replacement, she found that the administra-

tion fully supported selfagovcrnanco.

Leah lrnlay '10, who thought the address was “pretty good,“

said she would attend next semester “depending on how busy

I am."

Good added that he would defrnitcly come again. “it's a
valuable event, more people should show up," he said.

Evaluations not as secret as you think

BYSARAIIMIRK

As another semester comes to an end, stir
dents are once again treated to that moment
when professors awkwardly exit the class
room and leave students to anonymously fill
out evaluations of the course. Yet while some
students may assume the evaluations are typed
up after they slip them anonymously into the
class's green folder, in reality professors receive
a photocopy ofthe students handwritten ver-
sions. And some professors say they can tell
which students wrote which
anonymous ewrluation.

Every student in every . . ,,
class writes an evaluation (1W5 some ”mt-’-
at the semester, ranking the
course with both numbers
and prose. Photocopies of
students' handwritten evalus
ations are given to the professor and the de-
partment chair after grades are determined,
along with a statistical analysis sheet that
summarizes the numbers students bubble in
for each question. These evaluations help give
constructive criticism and support of prefer
sotls teaching techniques and are a critical part
of voicing student opinion during interim and
tenure reviews of professors.

During a meeting between the college
deans and the incoming SGA cabinet at the
beginning of the year, cabinet members were
surprised to learn that the copies of the Sm-
dsnts'handwrittcn evaluations are distributed
to the professor, not typed up versions allovk
ing greater anonymity. “I never really thought
about the process of ewluations," explained
SGA President Megan Goering. “I was on
dot the impression they typed them up." Not
typing the evaluations makes sense, Goering
acknowledged, since entering the thousands
of evaluations every semester would be a huge
job. But still, she said, the revelation was "stars

”I’ve had evaluatar’s remorse for

tlrng.”

“There rs a tendency at Grinnell to bc
straightforward,"Goering added, and the idea
that a professor might be able to tell which
student’s blunt words they’re reading “might
make people uncornfortableLcspccrally
when students may work again with the pres
fessors they criticize, Personally, Goering has
changed the way she's writing her evaluations
this semester. “I’ve curbed some of my lanv
guage,” she said

Professors can “absrr
lately" determine which
student wrote certain
evaluations, said Associate

Megan Goering’08, Dean Kathleen Skerrctt, a

, long-time Religious Studs

SGA Prestdent ies professor. While it’s rare

that professors see students'

handwriting, “Faculty who really, really want-
ed to ﬁgure it out probably could,” she said.

In Skerrett's experience, most students give
“responsible, constructive" comments profes-
sors wouldn't care to determine the origin of.
“It's rare to have an unkind or personal com-
ment," she said. In her time as a professor, the
dean only once felt “disturbed" enough by an
evaluation to try and determine who wrote it,
and she was never successful.To students wor—
tied about how professors might feel toward
them after they read the evaluations, Skerrett
said, “Be responsible. Don't write something
you wouldn't be willing to sign."

However, she explained, typing up all the
evaluations to ensure complete anonymity
would be “a huge project and it’s not clear that
it’s necessary," she said, “Most faculty respond
to criticism with gratitudetThe process is more
about what can I learn from what you learned
than.You don’t really care who said it.”

“It’s more work than it’s worth," agreed
SGA Vice President of Academic Affairs

Eric Olson '08. “1 don't believe profs are going
through trying to figure out what certain stua
dents are writing the evaluations are more
meaningful rfyou’re willing to be accountable
in some way "

Students in general seam unaware of
whether their evaluations are typed tip before
professors see them. “I have no idea,1 always
thought they were," said Rachel Glass '09,
though now knowrng professors might be able
to discern her identity doesn't phase her. “I
don't think I would inhibit myself. It’s impor—
tant for professors to know what I think."

Allie Gnadc ’09 felt differently,“l might be
more reserved in giving them my real opinions,
especially if I'm going to be taking another
class from them,"shc said.

Hnﬁma Ilyas '09 said she when she wants
to give particularly biting comments, sh:
sometimes changes her handwriting.

Esther Fernandez, Spanish, feels the effect
of evaluatious on the opposite side. Knowing
that students opinions profoundly affect her,
Fernandez waits six months to read class eval-
uations when she has lost some attachment
to the class. Even then, she looks only at the
statistical analysis of the e‘mluations, not the
handwritten copies themselves since she says
the handwriting reveals which student has
written which ewluation. “I know i can be in—
ﬂuenced,“ she said.

Ultimately, SGA decided not to pressure
the school to type up the evaluations, since
the process might be too much work. Another
possible solution son suggested would be
to complete evaluations on Pioneerweb. Still,
Goering feels students should be more aware
than she was about professors’ ability to discern
identity. “It does net seem fair to send students
in there not knowing the evaluations may not
be totally anonymous," said Goering. “I've had
evahrator's remorse for quite some time."
