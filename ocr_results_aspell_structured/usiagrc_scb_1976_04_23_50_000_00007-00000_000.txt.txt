;Grinne||’s the place for Conard

by Rosa Michnya

Louisa Sargent Conard, member
of the class of 1913 and former
botany instructor here, has
returned to Grinnell and taken up
residence at the Mayﬂower Home.

As a college student, Conard
especially enjoyed the microscopic
and drawing work involved in her

sbotany and zoology major. Her
onnchant for writing led her to
minor in English. Extracurricular
activities included field trips with
the Nature Study Club, Members of
’this group “took pride in having
’ supper outdoors every month in the
college year, including win-
tertlme” and “sat on logs and
shivered" while making fires and
hot coffee to Ward off the cold. Also
a member oi a writing club,
Conard and the others in this
“social group" shared their
literary endeavors and offered
constructive criticisms
{ She “revered” a faculty that she
considered “full of wisdom” and
knew President John H. T. Main, a
“tall, distinguishediooking gen»
tleman,” well enough to speak to
é'lim, Speaking oi her classmates,
she noted that many, including
herself, were “not interested in
political or World affairs" as much

5 in “getting through college and
,making the most of it.”

Financially, she was not in easy
circumstances during her college
years. At one point, she considered
attending Morningside College in
Sioux City, Iowa, because it was
closer to her hometown of Fonda
than Grinnell and, hence, “cheaper
to get to by railroad.” However,
when Grinnell College offered her
a scholarship to help defray the $75
per year tuition costs, she chose to

raccept it

As a ﬁrst-year student, she lived

'Tn Mears Hall. Her room. now a
study lounge, is in the southeast

‘vorner of the third floor, At that

;time, Mears was the only dorm,

ﬁnd it was reserved solely for
women. Male students (and other
female students) lived in the
town’s rooming-houses.

Conard could only afford to live
in Mears because she had worked

high school graduation and saved
her earnings She taught in a one;
room country schoolhouse in
Pocahontas County (near Fonda).
Having been inﬂuenced by a

mber of elementary school

achers after whom she wanted to
“model her life,” she never exp
ected to “do anything but teach”

town. A number of thunderstorms
sent her and her students
scurrying to the damp, muddy
cave. but “there was never
anything quite so serious as
another tornado," she said.
During her student years, she
also lived at the home oi Henry s.
Canard, a professor oi botany By
taking care of his children and
performing ironing and light
cleaning duties, she earned her
room and board, Later, she and
eight other senior women, “an

At the University of Chicago
irorn 1926-27, she took botany
courses and earned an MA. degree
in_cducation. She continued to
teach at Grinnell, and Doctor
Conard, the professor at whose
house she once stayed, was now
her colleague. He retired in 1944,
and, six years later, she married
the “man with a worldwide
reputation as a botanist,"

The couple subsequently bought

Avenue. She further described
these women as being “quite
congenial” and of are “same age
and seriousness of purpose.”

After graduating in 1913 with a
class of approximately 100
students, she stayed on at Grinnell
as a member of the “scrub
faculty.” serving as a botany lab
assistant and a tutor. At the same
time, she was able to take writing
courses at no cost.

When her mother died in 1916,
she returned to Fonda to help her
father take care of the house and
three younger children. The town
oi 1,000 people was founded by area
farmers as a trading center. While
there, she taught at the local high
school.

In 1923, Conard was back in
Grinnell, this time as a botany
instructor. Her students, she said,
were “quite sincere and serious
about wanting to amount to
something.” Teaching here was a
pleasantexperience, as she “never
had a rumpus” with any students,

and moved‘ there when She
resigned irom her teaching post in
1951. While her husband did
botanical research, she tutored two
dozen local children free of charge
and never turned down any child
wanting her assistance. Despite
having spent most oi her liie in
Iowa, Conard did not find it hard to
adjust to Florida’s climate, in fact,
Conard said that it was sometimes
hotter in Iowa during the summer
than it ever was in the southern
state.

After her husband’s death at age
97 tour and a halt years ago,
Cunard stayed in Florida alone,
Last summer, however, she
decided to sell the house.

in February of this year, she
returned to Grinnell because, as
she put it, “this is the place“ for
her. It is here that she has many
friends, as she lived in Grinnell for
about 35 years, She noted cheer-
fully that she does not “do anything
useful” now, but, always the
teacher, said she would be happy to
tutor anyone in need of her help.
