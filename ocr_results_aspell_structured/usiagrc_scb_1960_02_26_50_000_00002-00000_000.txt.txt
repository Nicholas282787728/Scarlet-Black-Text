Our Choice

There are, at this time, four serious candidates who
had declared themselves in time to present statements in
this " sue 0'1’ the Scarlet and B ck. Each of the candidates
has evpressed his ideas and viewpoints in his statement.
Our analysis and conclusion is drawn entirely from these
statements.

 

l

We agree with Dick Barbour that “it is about time tol,
quit playing political games and making a farce out ol'l
council elect ons.” But it does not seem to be a, ry strongi
campaign issue.

l

He shows concern, which we think is so necessary at‘

th point, in relationship to the uneasy situation between

the three governing bodie 01' the campus While his arlvor

cation of “clarification” in general, a good idea, the}

method he proposes has been used before with little sucr
ce

His “common sense" plank is hardlv something- upon
which candidate can base part of a platfrom and while
inform lg the students through the u wspaper and radio
is a good idea, we hold that such a duty, alo with
“common sense" should be an assumed respon b .

Mike Gough‘s proposed framework revision is a good,
point and an issue of no little importance. We agree tliat_l
it i “ be one i‘z‘i' " e efficiency of the coun ‘
eil could be increased are somewhat uneer iin coli-

Again, his statement, “The Student council should i
letain its functions . , ” is mere advocaiiou of stolus l
quo giving us nothing: to oppose nor favor l

The strongest point in Duane Krohnk s platform is,
his awareness that the Student council should be active
not only in campus affairs but in national and world
affairs. His idea that the council should stimulate discus .
sion and action on various academic problems and prrr
grams has merit. ;

However, his statement, “The Student council‘s tasl
is to handle student affairs at (i‘l'innell college . . , "
1. again too general considering the present contl'm'ei ,
concerning the issue. lie says that the council should ,
"undertake an evolution of the present dormitory 'tna- l
tion,” but» we are not sure, i‘l'om Krnhnke‘s printed
platform. what this situation is nor are we sure that
Krollnlie knows.

Jim Ris el"s two strongest points are ll‘ l'EOl'l iliiza-
tion of Central commi tee and his proposed Stilticdtvlncultv
committee to deal with academic dishone. . l

Snell reorganization of Central committee would do a
great deal to make the Student council, as representative
ol' tlle students, an active DOllCVrlllﬂl “14' body. It would}
mean that all policy uould originate irom the students‘
themselves rather than ll‘om the “topi’ l

tisser’s strongest point i. his student—faculty com—j
mittee to deal with academic dishonesty. Although the
academic dishonesty issue has been adopted into other‘
platforms, Ilissel"s stand is more definite and concretei
it is probably the most plo essille idea expressed as part
o’r' a campaign ill at least four years i

Not only uould it give, as 1‘! er lys, a better under-l
standing of the problem bllt it would, again, as in the
case of Ills proposed new Central Commit ee, give the stu-»
dents a maior responsibility in the operation and govern:
ing of the campus. l

Nevertliele iii discl 'ng- his two proposed commit-
tees, Rl .cr has faced two important lies. We believe
they are the most impor \nt is les to come out of thi
campaign He has pres . ed definite proposals in relation
ship to these i 'les.

In no other platl’orm statement has the argument that
students have no szly- o in policy or government been met
and resolved with as much determination and clearness.
Because of these propn als we believe that Jim Kisser has
the best program to otter the students as Student council
president.
