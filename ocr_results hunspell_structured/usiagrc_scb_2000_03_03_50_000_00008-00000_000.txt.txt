The 2000-01 SGA Presidenrinl elec—

bound by rhe faer rhar my eolurnn is due
a full erhours before rhe ﬁrst votes are

analysis is mueh easier rhan ir seems, so I
have analyzed whar would have made eaeh
ofrhe six eandidares win and written sum»

whoever aerually won rhe eleerion And
please disregard everyrhing else.

Sherman Willis: The Bill Bradley of
the Grinnell :lection. At ﬁrst, many Willis
supporlcrs thought rhar eheir candidare
was roo sofr spoken and roe reserved ro
win rhis eleenon But Wills larer proved
that hi: close ties to the Golden Girls and
Maecyver were polirieal dynarnire in rhis
eainpus obsessed by relevrsion. His answers
ro rhe 5 (7 B’s nuesrions were arrieulare,
but his repetitive use ofthc word “nooklc,”
especially in reference in sheila rhe Lunch

Joe Chifarii The Lyndon LaRouche

chifari is a felon; he is, however, a vierim

only way rhar Chifari managed ro win rhis
election was because ofn suddcn bout of

on campus excepr Chifari himself. His
