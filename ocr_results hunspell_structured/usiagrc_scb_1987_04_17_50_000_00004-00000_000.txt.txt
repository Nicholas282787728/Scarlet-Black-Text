problems You don't want to believe it, I
succumbed to peer pressure. Everyone
else takes drugs because of peer pressure,
and so i went out with girls.

Amy: For one thing, I don't have a
preference. I’m attracted to whom I'm at-
tracted to regardless of sex. I was pro-
blably about 17 I was very amazed that
homosexuality wasn't touching my high
school and not being talked about

Mark: First became Comfortable two days
ago, I spent two years being very depress-
ed, because of the way I was raised. But
my behavior indicated that I preferred
men.

isolation and a need ior total secrecy, but

gay issues, my mom asked.

Sill-tilt: They both feel it's wrong. Their
Christian upbringings have taught them
homosexuality and bisexuality are wrong
and against the will oi God My mother
isn't very vocal about it. but my iather
tends to be very biased against all gays.
They don‘t know. I don't think I'll ever lell
them, at least not until I’ve been on my
own for along while.

"If people see two gay
people balding bands ,
they see it as ﬂaunting
their sexuality. Since I see

beterosexualx doing
it, we should be able to.”

Que tion: [)0 you expect your liiiniusex
nuliiy to iiiteriere with getting a job?
Would you tell your clitploycr‘!

place oi work where it would be just a
relaxed atmosphere regarding people's
feelings towards gays.

Diane: No, I have no idea what I want do
do But I imagine it will limit my choices,
because ii I see a job where they would
discriminate against me it I were gay, i
wouldn't apply for It, it would also depend
on it I needed a job i think it could be a
problem

to be a teacher. lkind oi want to teach in a
smaller school. but it would be easier ior
inc at a larger school. l could also at least
have something oi a cultural liic.too

Suritli: It could very possibly. l'm coil-
sidei-ing going into education. and in that

Mtiik: probably it he were unsure oi his
feelings, I would never do anything. Only lf
i knew ior sure.

liiiinr: Usually. 1 Just sort oi let it go. i
would rather be t'rieiios mot and know the

sure it a guy likes her. She'll thrt, subtly.
and it there's a reaction. . I‘m not pars

Stirti : It's scary Approaching snmeoneot‘
the same gender without knowing it

afraid oi oitendmg her or scaring her into
ending our friendship. I most usually don't
approach people I don't ieel are my
iriends, in my high school, it the general
