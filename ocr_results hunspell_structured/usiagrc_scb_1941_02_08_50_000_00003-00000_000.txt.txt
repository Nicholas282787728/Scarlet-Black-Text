“he leaves you something to think
about. Brace Baldwin, Langan
freshman, reiterated Arney’s
statement by saying, “I enjoy
Dr. stevens' talks.”

“Class programs are my tavore
ites," Florence Iscnnett, Cleveland
sophomore, said, "but short con-
certs are awfully nice, too,”

Robert Smith, Langan prep, had
no objections to the programs as
they stand. "There is nothing
particularly wrong with them
now,” he said. David Rich, Raw-
son prep, was in agreement with
smith, but added, “I like to hear
the protessors, and I would like
to hear Rev, Mann and Dr. Nol-
len."

Mary Carpenter, Read junior,
suggested organ music. “I like to
sit and relax when I go to chapel,
and oigan music every day
would suit me."

Clint Taylor, Langan sopho-
more, and Mary Louise .Elder,
Pine Tree freshman, both asked
for more music, Taylor said. "I'd
like more organ music, in partic-
ular, classical selections,” Miss
Elder requested music in which
everybody can partiopate.

three women, are included in the
plot.

The entire show will be written
by students, Vranck said. “Co-
operation from the puhlicity and
drama departments and the ad-
ministration has bceu assured.”

Final plans will be considered
by the dramatic council before
casting and production start. "In
the meantime," Vranek conclud-
ed, "any student interested in
this type of show, with any ques—
tions, suggestions, or who would
like to try out for a part, should
contact one at the Friars."

no case is the raw lake water
used on the campus except for
the flushing of toilets All of the
hot water at the taps is con-
densed steam or city water heat-
ed All of the waterat the cold
water taps is city water.

“The point to be borne in mind
is that there is no danger to
health from the use of this
smelly water To the writer it is
a good deal like eating linihurger
cheese. You can down the
cheese if you can hold your nose
while you are doing it. However,
that doesn’t make me like lim-
burger cheese, and we don't at-
tempt to say that students and
others who have to use this hot
water have to like it,"
