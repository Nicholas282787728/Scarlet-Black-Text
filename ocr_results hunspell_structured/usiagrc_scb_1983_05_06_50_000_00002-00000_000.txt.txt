Cult Shock

The program scheduled for this Sun~
day evening entitled “The Cult Exr
perience" will include the following:

— lniormation and personal ex-
periences will be presented by three
former members o1 various destructive
cults, as well as the co-founder/cd
director of Unbound, a reentry facility
in Iowa City for former cult members.

Unbound is one of only three such
facilities in the country ~ the other two
are in Nebraska and Minnesota. They
have a success rate much higher than
most other types of hallway houses 'in
terms at the number 01 residents who
later return to their former cult

Grinnell students are among the most
highly vulnerable and susceptible
groups at people to the cult iniluence:
white, highly intelligent and educated,
middle and upper-middle class
backgrounds and not very
“street wise." Wlth graduation ap-
proaching [or many, and a move to a
new city or town {or the summer ior
others, students can feel a strong need
for the close and easily accessible
friendships found on a familiar cam»
pus. Recruiters ior cults prey upon and
recognize outward signs oi loneliness,
isolation, depression or simply
“newness” to an area

Coming up on Thursday, May 19, will
be a special showing of Ticket to
Heaven, 3 recent Canadian film
release about a young man's ex-
perience with the Unification Church
(“Moonies”) and his kidnapping and
deprogramming. it is based on a true
story and even has some of the actual
people in the iilm instead or actors.
Definitely worth it if you’re done with
finals. Shown at 7:30 in Science 171.

“The Cult Experience" and the Show»
ing of Ticket to Heaven are sponsored
Gates Halls and Rich Close, Chaplain
Intern and student at United
Theological Seminary oi the Twin
Cities.

A personal response

to Arbatov

by Liz Voigt

Doctor Georgi Arbatov's recent visit to
Grinnell evoked many responses ranging
from academic interest to the purely emo-
tional, but none were quite like the
response from Ellen Piekalkiewicz.

As a political science student,
Piekalklewicz was naturally interested in
hearing Arhatov, but her interest was in-
creased by the fact that she has relatives
still in Poland.

Plekalkiewicz attended a luncheon for
Arbatov and asked him some pointed ques-
tions about Poland and me situation there.
His answers left her angry and irustrated.
“He blatantly lied to me," reported
Piekalkiewicz "He made it seem as
though the Poles didn't mind martial law."

It was Piekalkiewicz's personal involve-
ment with the Polish crisis that made Ar-
batov’s responses so unsatisfactory {or
her, Piekalkiewicz was visiting her (amlly
in Poland during the summer of 1980 when
the Solidarity Movement first got media
attention there. She remembers the excites
merit of her Polish relatives when pros
solidarity news and inrormation was
broadcast on television. Up until that mo.
ment, the movement had been subject to
media censorship, and news about
Solidarity had to be passed on by word of
mouth, Evidently, this emedia
breakthrough gave the Polish people hope

ed today and tomorrow (May 6~7) at

Grinnell dropped 772 and 20-1 tilts to Coe,
the defending conference Champion, last
Wednesday. Lisa lngenito and Kanty

Tennis

The Grinnell College tennis team closes
1933 action with an appearance at the
Midwest Conference Meet scheduled
Thursday and today at Lawrence Univer-
sity in Appleton, Wis.

Delending champion Carleton is favored
to remain at the top of the standings and
Ripon is ranked as the strongest challenge.

Although no Pioneers are expected to
challenge for individual titles, Coach Ed
Dombrowski is hoping for points from Dan
Silversmith and Mark Cloud in the number
two and (our singles classes.

Grinnell placed third at a Heam invita-
tional hosted by Carleton last weekend.

 

that the movement would he a success, Ac-
cording to Piekalkiewicz, when news of the
strikes were broadcast. “People
everywhere were elated,”

After returning home, letters irom her
relatives enabled her to further see the
Poles’ response to the movement.
Piekalkiewicz states, “With the advent of
martial law the tone of the letters became
one of severe depression and disillusion-
merit."

Pielkalkiewicz was enlightened further
about the Situation when her Polish aunt
visited her over spring break and related
the events of the first day of martial law.

The family awoke to armed soldiers and
tanks crowding the streets. Terrified, they
discovered the phones were cut oil and
neither the television nor the radios were
broadcasting. These last discoveries add-
ed a feeling or isolation to their terror.

Arbatov‘s “glossed" answers contrasted
with Piekalkiewicz's memory of her aunt's
story and her summer in Warsaw and leit
her feeling furious. “I had to leave," she
states, ”I couldn‘t even finish my lunch."

When asked what she thought might be
the reason for Arbatov’s responses she
answered, “Well, as a Soviet Official he
probably had to say those things {or the
sake of propaganda; at least, that is what I
hope."

Awareness
seen as key

Continued lrorii page 1
study program, possibly funded through
such organizations as the Committee on
Student Life'tC_S.Lti. The future funding
of the service is dependent on a continued
increase in the use of ‘ it: service by the
Grinnell College campus,

The current program is on a six-week
trial run until the end of the semester.
While the escort service was conceived by
the Women’s Group. its Composition now
exceeds the limits of the Women’s Group,

There are Currently many men and
women who have volunteered their time to
the service in addition to the original core
from the Women's Group. The volunteers
are located in the Health Center every
night from a pm. until 2 am. and their
private extensio is 1824.

While the use or the service by the cam-
pus community has been good, the major
short range goal remains the task of
achieving popular acceptance of the escort
service,

One volunteer, Karyn Reif, believes that
the task lies in making the student body
aware of the purpose of the service.

"People must consciously understand
that they are not creating a hassle ior us."
she added, "You'll be surprised upon calls
ing the service, to find that one of your
friends answers the phone We're not a
group of faceless, uniformed guards. More
likely we’re the people who live down the
hall or across the street "
