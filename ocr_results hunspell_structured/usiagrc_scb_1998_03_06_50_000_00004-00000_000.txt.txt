Famed dance queen arrives Yo-yoing to a better future

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

Grinnell‘s Dance Troupe Will be
one step closer to greatness when
Ann Hutchinson Guest, the world‘s
foremost authority on dance nota»
tion, arrives on campus today.

Guest. who resides in London.
will work with members of Profesn
sor Teresa Heiland's dance notar
tion class on their upcoming per
formance of L'npras-midt' d'un
fauna in April. Her visit represents
a season of unprecedented growth
and opportunity for Heiland‘s stu-
dents and the Grinnell community.

“As far as I know, nothing like
this has ever happened before."
said Professor Heiland. “Grinncll
College has never reconstructed a
historical ballet as accurately as we
are attempting to.”

There is an extravagant story
behind Fauna. Its composer,
Vaslav Nijinsky, was part ofa turn
of the century artistic movement
commonly called Diaghilev‘s
Circle, a group designed to ini-
prove the quality and reputation of
the arts in Europe and widely re—
garded as one of the most inﬂuen-
tial artistic conglomerations of all
time. Included among its members
were performing artists from fields
such as dancer choreography, de—
sign and composition. Picasso.
Stravinsky and Dolin belonged.
The circle is named after Sergei
Pavlovich Diaghilev, a Russian
lawyer who was fond of ballet and
made the contacts to establish the
group.

This artistically fertile environ-
ment was the pasture from which
fauna grew. It was one ofthe first

 

products ofDiaghilev’s Circle, Ils
score was composed by Claude
Debussy; its artistic design was
done by Leon Baskt, The dance,
which was completed in 1912. told
the story ofa fight between a faun
and a group of nymphs. Fauna was
the first ballet choreographed by
Vaslav Nijinsky and was unusual
for its time. The ballet dancers
danced in their bare feet; the dance
itself incorporated many new
movements IMO the choreography
that had never been used before.
When Fauna premiered In Paris,
the audience was shocked. Today,
Nijinsky is seen as a forerunner of
modern dance.

The most inleresting tidbit
about this show, however, is that
is was lost for almost half a cen-
tury, This is where Ann
Hutchinson Guest comes in.

When Nijinsky originally chov
reographed Fauna, he used a style
of dance notation that he had de~
signed himself. Because he had
not translated it to any other form
of dance notation before he died
in 1950, no one was able to read
the notes he left behind.

That was until 1988 when Ann
Hutchinson Guest, working along
with Claudia Jeske, managed to
solve the puzzle.

Guest had studied Nijinsky’s
scores for years and talked to the
surviving dancers who had per
formed in the dance in an attempt
to reconstruct the original produce
tion. Her big break came in 1987
when she was allowed to read
Nijinsky’s personal diaries and
notebooks. It was there that she
found references to the Luca Della

interviews.

This week, Annika Engineer speaks
with theme-masters Craig Alpha and
Andrew Choquette about controversy,
Michael Jackson, and shots.

Now, the title “ Crow Shots"
may not be the most enticing name
one has ever heard. Intriguing
maybe, interesting possibly, enter-
taining conceivably, but probably
not enticing. As it turns out, the
show “Crow Shots" is all four of
the above and, what’s more, even
the name begins to grow on you
after a while. “Crow Shots" actu-
ally refers to Craig Alpha ‘98 and
Andrew Choquette's ’00 radio
show every Monday afternoon at

l:10 pm. Craig Alpha and Andrew -

Choquette endeavor to tell more
about their radio show and get to
the bottom ofthe crow shot saga.

AE: So, is there a story behind
the somewhat unique title of your
show?

AC: Well, it was really kind of
random, 1 have a shot glass in my
room with aplastic crow attached
to the bottom...

CA: And we were struggling
the night before to come up with
a name.

AC: And that was the first
thing we saw.

AE: Hence the name “Crow
Shots." I get it, What's the main
theme of your show?

CA: Well actually. the whole
thing is a theme show, so every
week we just go with a different
theme. Like, naturally this week
the theme was Disco,

AC: And we've had an 8021
week and a Valentine's week.

CA: Yeah, we did a love week,
and a President's Day show,

AC: Basically, every week it’s
just a different thing,

AE: So it's really more of a
word theme than a genre theme.

CA: Exactly.

AE: What are the types of songs
that you play 7

AC: Mostly anything that has
some sort of reference to the
theme.

CA: Like for President‘s Day
we played “Presidents of the

United States" and “All about the ‘

Benjamins" by Puff Daddy...
AC: But we don‘t really care

about what music we play, as long
as it fits our‘themes.

AE: Do you guys have a favor»
ite genre or type of music that you
like to play on your show?

CA: Well, current raprtype stuff
comes up a lot, but we mostly play
a little of everything that's pretty
upbeat; nothing really slow. Our
biggest partlality though, I have to
say, is Michael Jackson

AC: Yeah...we end every show
with a Michael Jackson song.

AE: And why is that 7

Andrew Choquette co-har/r “Crow
Slims. "

AC: Well, he‘s just the man.

AE: Or woman, Who knows
these days 7 What type of music
do you think that most ofthe camv
pus listens to and in relation to
that, where do you think your
show stands?

AC: Well, I don't think tliai all
that many people listen to the
whole R & B rap
thing. proportionally I mean. But
because we do so many different
things, it's kinda fun to listen to,
just to see what kind ofstuff we‘ll
come up with. Sometimes we’ll
make a connection out Oanli’llng,
Like, if itjust has one word in it
that fits our theme, we'll play it.

AE: Do you get a lot of people

With her expert knowledge of
dance notation and the liid of this
critical clue, Guest was able to
translate the entire score into a
form of dance notation called
labanotation in lime to have it per
formed by the Julliard school in
1989, a century after Nijinsky’s
birth.

Baskt expert Professor Leonard
Curtis of the University of Iowa
will be coming to aid iii the con-
struction of the backdrop and scen-
ery. Costumes and wigs have been
researched and will being accord-
ing to the original design.

The Grinnell Orchestra will be

performing the original score.
Spacing limitations in the Fine
Arts Theater will force the orches-
tra to be seated in a balcony above
the stage. “It will have a very dif—
ferent feel but the sound quality
shouldn’t be affected," said Profesr
sor Heiland

In order to better inform the
campus of what went into
Grinnell's Faune, two discussion
dates have been set. The first will
be Tuesday, March 10 featuring
Guest at 4:15. The second will be
in April, where several expert ad-
visors will gather to discuss their
backgrounds and the significance
of their areas of the presentation.
The show itselfbe performed April
17»l9.

“I’m very excited about this,"
said l-leilcnd. “An opportunity like
this gives dancers an eye for his
tory." And considering the circumn
stances, perhaps a place in it.

calling in?

AC: Depends on the theme, usu-
ally.

AE: What’s been your most
popular theme so far 7

AC: The Valentine‘s day one.
We had a lot of people calling in
and dedicating songs.

CA: We had one guy get all mad
because of one of the things we
said.

AC: Yeah, we caused a little
controversy.

AE: Interesting. How'd you
manage that 7 Tell more,

CA: Oh,just by being idiots and
spouting out random things.

AC: I said Puff Daddy was a
sellout so then we had an argument
about what the term sell out means.
So we put him on the air and let
him speak his

CA: -Piece.

AC: -Mind.

AE: And what was the outcome
of this little debate 7

CA: Well, he had a good argu-
ment but it just didn‘t come out
very well over the air.

AC: It wasn't anything major,
really. We just like to make it
sound like it was.

AE: Hmrn. So you guys like
to provoke people and cause
trouble, huh?

CA: Definitely. It doesn‘t hap»
pen too often, though. People are
kinda tentative to call in.

AE: Welljudging by whatyou
just said, I'm not surprised. What
do you think is the most unique
aspect of your show 7

CAzActually. I‘d like to think

‘it’s us. Mainly, we just like to
have fun.

AE: And do you have fun 7

CA: Yeah, apart from last
show when Choq wasn’t there
and I was marred by technical
difficulties

AE: How would you describe
your show to someone?

CA: Well, I think that everyone
who listens to it would get some
entertainment out of it, especially
in light of us makingjackasscs out
of ourselves.

AE: And I take it you guys do a
pretty goodjob oflhnl”

CA: Well, actually we do that oii
a daily baSlS,.,InuillpiC times

AE. So it doesn’t really trike too
much trying. huh?

CA. No.

AC: No.

AE: How would you sum up
your show in one sentence or lessv

CA "It's the show that shags
like n minx,” but where that came
from, I have no idea.

most of us leave this pastime Wlliiln
our childhood, forgetting our yo-
yoing skills. The new Expcrimcnlzll
College yaryo class turns to bring this
pastime back lo Gl'iiilicllldns.
Nathan White '00 is tin expert in
the art of yOryolllg. “I started in yo-
yo in fifth grade. It was a big i‘iid. A
representative from Playmax, which
makes yo—yos, came to my school
He taught us a bunch of yo-yo tricks
That inspired the yo-yo fad iii my
school. Everyone was yoryoing in

the hallways," said While. “I learned ,

from watching everyone else, I also
checked out a lot of books on yaryo
tricks, Anything that had tricks in it,
I learned from."

While most yo-yocrs start early,
White admits that some can start later
in life. In fact, White stopped yo-
yoing fora while. “Idldll'l really yo
yo injunior high, but Idld do a little
in high school. I have bccii doing it
heavily since my senior year. Basin
cally, I learned how to yeryo in him

things, though," he said.

“I have gotten hit in

when the strings
break.” - Nathan

"I am getting really frustrated, I
prance so much, but I can't seem to
get it to sleep. I yo-yo to and from
my classes and I yonyo for about fif-
tccn minutes every day,"Vlscik said
On the other hand, Vic5ik concedes
that she has learned it lot from the
class, “I have improved. I can do a
couple tricks now, like front pass and
lunar loop. I can almost do
around the world," Viscik
commented.
Viscik claims that she

Secret Mark agreed.“Yo»

cular aclivity, It is an ac-
livity where the object ale
ways comes back to its
point of origin, Well, not
always. Sometimes you
get hit. I think that every _
one in the class could say
something about those exe
periences," said White. “I
have gotten hit many
times. Once I got hit in the
head with a yeryo and I
_ had to stop yonyoing for a

couple days. The yonyo
can fly at high velocities. It can be
quite dangerous, especially when the
strings break. I have also broken win-
dows like that."

And what is possibly in the future
