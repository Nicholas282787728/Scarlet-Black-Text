- T0 YELL, OR NOT TO YELL

With torch lights ﬂaring, a crowd of college
men and women marched and sang and yelled to
welcome in another Homecoming day and the
first home football game of another year. It is
very easy for the intellectual to sit in his study
and smile with a half-sympathetic but condescend»
ing gesture of superiority. To him these things
are merely the unreasoncd emotional outburst of
immaturity and adolescence. What business do
college men have getting excited about a football
game and shouting as if it really mattered? Will
not Grinnell and Carleton go on just the same re»
gal‘dless of who wins the game?

Of course the intellectual is right,—in a way.
The history of the World or Iowa or Grinnell will
go on much the same regardless of the outcome
of today’s game. The poor will be just as hungry
whether we win or lose, and scholastic attain»
ment will be much the same, except for the poss-
ibility of a victory day. Yet We can’t help won-
dering whether life should be just a process of
study, food and clothing. Are those things which
can be measured by the mind of the scholar all
that matter?

The world is sadly enough in need of scholars,
and millions are hungry who need the food which
a wiser economic order might be able to offer.
Yet the best of scholars will do well to drop his
books and shout with the enthusiasm of those
who vigorously want the Pioneers to come off with
a laurel. Life would be dull indeed if we only
ate and studied, even if all were fed and clothed.

G—
BEYOND THE CAMPUS

It is said that the college student quickly
be read. If it is something so remote as a dis-
cussed. If the matter is of campus affairs, is may
be read. If it is of something so remote as :1 dis»
cussion'of international relations or unemploy—
ment, it is quickly avoided in favor of another.
Probably for that very reason this editorial will
not be read by those very people to whom it is
most addressed.

Campus problems interest us most because
they touch us most intimately; broader fields seem
intellectual and removed from life, at least for us
who are still protected by college walls. It is
true enough that we feel more quickly and more
directly the result of campus action. What is
done about the Pioneer Prudities, or their sub-
stitute, will change our own activities during the
coming days and weeks.

Yet the sum and total of all these college
problems will have vastly less effect on our lives
than the murder of an Arch Duke might have.
Probably the papers are too sensational in their
treatment of the recent European calamity, arous-
ing a greater fear of immediate war than the
actual danger warrants, yet the fact remains that
portentious currents are being distrurbcd on the
other side of the Atlantic, Problems which seem
remote to college students today may tomorrow
lead them from home and friends forever, Eco-
nomic discussions which seem removed from life
are in fact dealing with the hopes or despair: of
our whole generation. Prosperity and poverty,
life and death actually hang on the questions
which we too quickly avoid in favor of a discus»
sion of the future of the Lantern.

This casts no reflections on the great value
of campus editorials. We should read them With
interest, for the college is our community and, we
can make it healthy by our interest or let it
stagnate by our lethargy. Yet larger problems
shape our future,

.43—
A NAVAL RACE?

Slowly but surely the World is being drawn
into another naval arms men which may make the
naval competition of 1914 look inconsequental.

Opinion seems to be rather universal in ac<
:epting the fact that the London naval treaties
which definitely expire in 1936 will not be renew-
)d. Japan has practically announced her intcn<
(ion of building a navy large enough to placc her
on arity with the other great powers of the
wor- d. This is in reality an indirect declaration

of an intention to oppose the renewing of the
London and possibly the Washington naval agree»
ments, for under these treaties Japan can not
achieve her desired parity with the other nations
of the world.

Just What this rather evident intention of
abandoning these two naval treaties will mean
is not yet clearly evident, although all signs point
to a renewal of a disastrous naval rivalry which
can easily develops into another international con-
ﬂict such as the world witnessed from 1914 to
1918. This, of course, would be tragic, but un-
less the statesmen of the world begin to show a
sincere desire for cooperation in solving this prob-
lem, the worst is likely to happen.

The world can not afford to have any more
disastrous and unsuccessful disarmcnt conferences
such as the recent ones have been, and the sooner
the statesmen of the world realize this fact, the
sooner the world will achieve its greatly needed
and desired peace.

G
PLAYING WITH MATCHES

The road to world peace has been plainly
marked out in the years since the World VJar. A
vast amount of lime and labor has been spent
performing this great task. The famous Four»
teen Points of Woodrow Wilson was one of the
initial steps toward international conciliation. The
creation of the League of Nations and its Covenr
ant was the next great step forward. The Wash—
ington Nine»Power treaty was an important ad-
vance in the post-war movement for peace. Fin-
ally, in the Briand»Kellogg pact the nations of the
world formally renounced war as an instrument
of national policy and agreed to settle all their
disputes by pacific means only.

But how closely have nations observed their
solemn agreements and lived up to their earlier
ideals‘.7 Militarlsm is in many countries being
fostered and stimulated to a fanatical degree.
Nations are again engaging in an international
armament race. Suspicion is being deliberately
created. Hatreds are being fanned to a danger-
ous extent. The territorial integrity of China
was openly violated, and when the Chinese tried
to strike back against these agressicns they were
burned and slaughtered in the streets of Shang-
hai. And now to heighten the general tension
has come the assassination of King Alexander of
Jugoslavia and Foreign Minister Bartrou of
France, an indication of the political ferment in
the Balkan states. As long as such a state of
affairs is allowed to prevail, world peace will re—
main a myth.

If a tragic repetition of the world War is to
be avoided, then governments and peoples must
lay aside the sword and replace it with the peace-
ful word. Playing with matches is indeed no
way to avert fire. Just so, playing with intrigue
and machines of war only kindles the war spirit.
If even one of the great powers proves false to the
existing treaties and principles, the whole struc~
ture of world peace is threatened. Fidelity to
those treaties and principles and strict observance
of them be must maintained, for only in them is
peace secure.

' KEEP HOLLYWOOD OUT

Saturday’s football game marked more than a mere
victory for Washington State over Southern California.
It marked, instead, the'victory of a team which plays
football for the game’s sake over a team of Hollywood»

cans, now only go through the motions.

For several years Trojan football players have been
idols in the eyes of the mercenary population of Hollywood.
Rather the Trojans thought they were idols, though
actually they were as toys to some henna-haired beauty
or to a film magnate. They were wined and dined and
made to feel the world was theirs, when they were really
just pawns in the grip of those wishing to further their
own interests.

Now that victory is no longer theirs, the Trojan grid
men are going to discover that their real boosters are not
the selfishly-interested fair-weather Hollywood admirers
who are quick to change affections, but the S. C. stu-
dents, alumni, and coaching staff.

The handwriting had been on the wall for a long time.
That Washington State should be the immediate cause of
defeat was a mere coincidence of the schedule. Any
learn in the coast conference would have beaten 5. c. as
it was playing Saturday.

Hollywood has taken itself out of the Southern
California athletic picture because it dosen‘t adore losers.
in that respect the W.s.c. loss will be beneficial to Troy.
The question of whether Hollywood is to smy out will
have to be answered by the players. '

This editorial is not written to discount tlic ability of
Troy grid warriers who, in the past, have brought much
glory to the Cardinal and Gold. Rather it is written to
show a group of disillusioned players just who their
sincerely interested backers are — truly interested in
their success and welfare.

If s. C.’s gridders can forget the false friendship of
Hollywood and buckle down to the task of football, backed
by a united Southern California, there is nothing that can
stop thorn from vonquishing Pitnburgh Saturday.

Remember that Troy football games have won plenty
for Hollywood; but Hollywood has never won football
games for Troy.

The Book Nook

By TED KLEIN

While glancing through the college
calendar for the month of October, 1
noticed that on next Tuesday there
will be a lecture given at Herrick
chapel on international relations. Fast
experience has taught me that un—
less I bother to do a little reading on
questions related to the speaker’s sub-
ject half the lecture has slipped by
before 1 am on common grounds with
him.

Heretofere, I have relied completely
on Time, the weekly news magazine,
because I knew that its articles were
short and interesting, that its infor‘
mation could be relied upon, and that
i wouldn’t have to walk upstairs to
get it at the library. However, find
ing myself on the second ﬂoor of the
library as 1 read the calendar. I felt
it a moral obligation to at least browse
through a few of the periodicals 1
often had seen on the racks in the
reading room but toward which 1 had
maintained an unchanging attitude of
studied detachment.

Groaning inwardly at the thought of
wading through ten or twelve page
articles full of interesting statistits on
the copper imports of Borneo for the
period 1995.11 and written in the
“first, second, eighth, and ninth
place" style, I picked up a magazine
called World Afairs. The cover was
conservatively unprornising, but I’m
American enough to know that bright
colors on the labels can't improve
the quality of the beans.

Glancing through the contents, the
title, “Britain and the New Deal," by
Richard Law, M. 1:, caught my eye

Mr. law required only one page to '

give a keen analysis of the English
character and the part that the Eng»
lishman’s stolidity has played in giving
to Britain an imperceptible, almost un-
conscious, New Deal. A few pages

 

over, ltussell Wentworth. Commandant
of the Police of Cairo, Egypt, told
in a page and a half the magnificent
work the League of Nations has done
in stamping out the drug habit. Al—
though it is told in the laconic man-
nor of the man of action, this story of
real achievement against one of man’s
most vicious habits impresses one
deeply.

I passed on to the magazine called
The Saturday Review, the publication
of the Conservative party in England.

international relations proved to be

by the aforementioned magazines.
whether you merely wish to be able
to follow with ease what the coming
speaker has to say, or if you wish to
turn out a term paper ‘on the subject,
vitally interesting material to suit
your purpose can be found on the
