it mention oi politics caused the
Englishwoinau's lace to light up with
enthusi sni. "We English are a pole
itically minded people, Whereas you
send your best minds into business,
the greatest brains or England are
iound in politics. Even the women
'and th laborers are inteeted. The long
struggle waged by the women or Eng-
laud tor the right to vote was due to
the iact that it was the only field not
open to us, and the only one ler which
we cared." Fuliticully, .\liss Reyden
-is a member or the labor party. She
spoke glow‘ingly ct Ramsey McDonald,
for whom she has campaigned in the
mining district at South Wales which
returns MacDonald to Parliament.

The question. “What is England's
cond ‘on economically'l” brought the
suspi ion of a troiru to Miss Royden's
face for the first and only time dur—
ing the interview.

“Not at all goat,” she replied de—
cisively. “The number of unemployed
has been stabilized at a million and a
quarter for several years, and does
not decrease. Emigration might air
ter a solution, were it not tor the
fact that our people seem to hare
lost their Immerseekiug. adventure-
‘ tinct. The situation in the mining
ndnstry is particularly bad, and the
miners are losing hope." According
to Miss Ruyﬂen, there will be no econr
oniic improvement or lessening or in-
dustrial bitterness until the present
conservative government is erei
thrown.

ANY way you ﬁgure it, RA. is better tobacco.
Take fragrance, for instance. Your well-knovm
olfactory organ will tell you. And taste—who
can describe that? And mildness—you couldn’t
ask for anything milder.

Yes, Sir, P. A. Is cool and comfortable and
mellow and mild. Long-burning, with a O'tmd
clean ash. You never tire of RA. It’s always the
same old friendly smoke. Get yourself a ti
red tin and ‘check everything I’m telling you!

QUEST OI” BEAUTY!

LIFE without beauty would
be life withotlt meaning,
stars without light! Eve must
have been beautiful or that
lovely lost garden would not
have evolved her as its
crowning glory. Do you want
beauty without artiﬁc'ality?
It so. ask for Elizabeth
Arden's Venetian Prepara-
tions for the skin at stoaks'.
You will be charmed by their

loveliness.
