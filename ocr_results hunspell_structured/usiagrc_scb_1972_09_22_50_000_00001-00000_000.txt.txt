The Black Library

Plan Black library Expansion

by Martha Wacker

Following negotiations between
CBS, SGA, and the administration
last December, the library has as-
sembled a collection of BOO-plus
books along the south wall of the
20th Century Room. The Black Li-
brary consists of Volumes on Black
culture, literature, history and so-
ciology. Black art and cultural ob—
jects will be added to the room in
the near future.

Assistant librarian Mary Gae wyly
has been working since last spring
to add to the collection of Black Stur
dies materials. Following recoms
mendations by the Library Com»
mittee, and a statement by Presiv
dent Glen Leggett in February set-
ting guidelines tor the library, Mrs.
Wyly assembled books irom all
areas at the library. Sixty new books
were added tothe 20th Century Room
between April and -June. More
volumes were ordered over the
summer and there are presently
approximately 210 orders in pro-
cess, on the recommendationoivirs

Mr. Kenneth Christiansen and Mr.
Robert Voertman, Professors of
Biology and Economics respective-
ly, last Monday issuedarecommen»
dation to the administration that phy-
sical plant procedures for heating
Grinnell dormitories be adjusted on
the basis oi studies made by LEAP
since December, 1971.

LEAP, the Local Effluents and
Abatement Procedures practicum,
Conducted for three semesters a
series of experiments concerning
the fuel flow into college dorr
mitories. During the wintermonths,
it was iound, the physical plant was
pumping so much heat into the core
mitories that students were opening
their windows in order to be com-
iortable. By gathering data on the
temperatures or selected roomsand
the percentage oftime windowswere
open, LEAP Heat and Energy groups
concluded that the extensive use of
tool was unnecessary.

The issue at tuel consumption has
both environmental and economic
implications, because oi thegeneral
approaching crisis oi iuel avails
ability and also because of the [idle
tar cost of the wasted fuel.

The major recommendation is that
the physical plant stair readjust the
settings on the steam ilow controls
in order to attain a more efficient
schedule of fuel consumption.

The recommendation, authored by
Voertman, who headed the Heat and
Energy groups oi LEAP, also notes
that “longer run needs for fuel cons
servation and ior budget conser-
vation Will require some math»
fications oi the heating systems
controls and a much greater use oi
storm windows, insulation, andtrafr
fic control in buildings, Our data
chieiiy demonstrates an enormous
variation in temperatures invalious
parts or the buildings ”

lessor American Studies and His-
tory)

The immediate addition of more
volumes is uncertain at this time,
as there are no funds set aside for
specific use in the Black Library.
Afro-American Studies is now an
oiiicial major oi the college and
money will be allocated accordingly
when the Library Committee meets
and the budget is set,

The Black Studies books are marks
ed with red tape to simplify shelv-
ing of the collection, but are cata-
logued and circulated among all
other books in the library, Mrs,
Wyly has a file which lists the Cole
lection, and which is available upon
request at the main desk. She has
also compiled a number of biblioA
graphies on various topical holdings
oi the library, one oi these being
AtrosAmerican Studies.

The original guidelines tor the
Black Library included plans ior
a “representative collection of
Block journals and newspapers .
to be available in the 20th Century
Room." Barry Huff, spokesman
tor CBS, names the placing oibound
volumes oi periodicals in the
Black Library as one at the imme
diate goals in this year's improve
ment of the Library. The library
presently subscribes to twelveBlack
periodicals which are available on
the magazine racks on the first
floor.

The first negotiations between CBS
and the library staff this year also
included plans for Black art and culs
tural objects and posters to be put
on display in the 20th Century Room,
by members of CBS, In addition,
Mrs. Wyly hopes, through money
from the Robert’s Lectureship Fund,
to introduce lectures or readings by
Black poets in the 20th Century
Room.

The Black Studies Committee and
several professors are compiling a
bibliography which will meet the
needs of students in Black Studies
courses CBS hopes to add 1500
more books in the next three to
iive years, as they are ordered
These books will replace present
holdings in the zoth Century Room,
Whether or not this will mean come
plete reservation of the room for
Black Studies books is not certain
at this time.

Librarian Christopher McKee St-
resses that the library is attempting
to meet student curricularneedsdir
rectly. With regardtoimprovenient
in all areas, including Blackstudies,
he is eager to work from student
input, speciiic bibliographies and
suggestions, to insure that the libs
rary meets the i-eseui-ohdemands oi
course Work, He views the Black
library as one area oi specializa-
tion within the overall collection of
the library

Mr. McKee States that he would
“really appreciate" any grassroots
kind oi lll»pu| complaints, spe-
ciiic requests, and/or suggestions
He ieels this type or communication
between libi-ni-y personnel amt stu-
dents has been lacking in the past,
and would be beneiicial in solving

NUMBER 5

$31,542 Budget Passes SGA

by Michael Breed

In it marathon meeting Wednesday
night SGA approved a budget ior the
first semester of the 1972773 school
year and passed a resolution suppor-
ting the 1ettuceboycott. Other issues
acted on were initiative Fundguide~
lines and thesociai moodon campus,
The meeting, which lasted iour iuli
hours, was also highlighted by role
definitions by the members of the
SGA cabinet and explanations of
their current activities

The major part ot the‘meeting
was concerned with passage of the
new SGA budget, While the budget
differs little from budgets of the
past inﬂationary pressures on the
activity fund have brought it under
closer scrutiny this year. Sections
provoking the most controversy
were the Public Events Committee,
a new area oi iunding ior son, and
the initiative Fund.

The Initiative Fund, established
iive years ago in an attempt to take
some of the social emphasis off
the halls, has viewed its role as
one ot iunding social and cultural
events which do not fall under the
Jurisdiction of the halls. This year
the budget allowed the Initiative
Fund $l,500 a semester, The hall
fund allocation this year was to be
$2.25 per student, a iigure which
many hall presidents did not feel
filled their needs,

Alter a long argument,weighingthe
needs of the halls against the need
ior a fund where independentgroups
of students could obtain mo $500
was transferred from the i alive
fund to the hall fund by it 97573
vote. This action will raise the al»
location for halls to $2.65 per stu-
dent.

In the public events area $3,750
has been budgeted to bring major
periorming groups to campus. This
iigure is matched by a $3,000 con-
tribution from the administration,
This allocation was criticized,
since Roberts Theater is not large
enough to hold the entire student
body. Certain performances Will
only be given once, meaning that a
number oi students will not be
able to attend. Economics Profes-
sor Jack Dawson appeared at the
meeting to defend the Committee’s
iunding, and acknowledging that
while some students would beclosed

out Of events that they might wish
to attend, the committee is trying
by the use oi multiple periormances
to make the bulk of its events ac~
cessible to everyone who is inter
ested in attending

A SL347 50 allocation was setaside
tor the SGA accounts This figure
includes salaries of $200 dollars I!
picoe ior the son president, Vice
presidents, andSudent Coordinator,
president, Vice presidents, andStus
dent Coordinator, as well as $100
a piece [or three‘assistnnt Student
Coordinators. The Social Coordinas
tor’s allocation totaled $14,900 for
iirst semester. The largest section,
$8,700, goes to major concerts, In
salaries the Social Coordinator gets
$150 per semester, and $250 per
semester iS divided among the move
ies chairman, Coffee House chairs
man, and [our assistants

The 5&8 was given $3,250 forfli‘st
semester. Total expenditures onthe
paper are expected to be $6,355 but
an expected advertising and sub-
scription revenue oi $3,115 helps
to deti-ay this expense.

The Auditor's allocation came uns
oer iire, particularly irom Robin
Cowan, Read Hall president, Alter
some debate the Assistant Audi-
tor’s salary was raised from $100
to $125 per semester and the Audi-
tor’s salary was set at $250 per
semester, A motion to change that
iigure to $200 a semester was de-
feated 5-9-1,

The radio station’s allotment for
first semester was set at $2500,
This includes a large equipment re-
placement budget which will not be
included in second semester’s allo-

Dazed Joint Board members struggled through

cation, which is expectedtobeSlbOO,
Other items in the KDIC budget are
$700 dollars ior programming ma
terials such as tapes and records,
and $250 for a teletype to be shared
with the SilzB,

This yields a total budget of $30,
$41.80 for first semester, with a
budgeted deficit of $884.80 Expected
revenue from the pinball machines,
the cottee house, and the used book
store, as well as a proposed ins
crease in the activities fee, will
help to defray this deficit. The to,
tal budget was passed 15- 2- 2, with
Harry Derdeirian and Robin Cowan
voting no and Russ MacGregor and
Arie Walter abstaining

In other action, the lettuce reso-
lution was passed 17-0-1. The re-
solution gives support to Cesar
Chavez and the United Farm Work—
ers. in an attempt to iorcethegrow—
ers to recognize the union a nationr
wide boycott oi Iceberg head lettuce
has been called by Chavez. PaSv
sage oi the supporting resolution
by SGA means that the school food
Service will no longer serve lions
United Farm Workers Union lets
tuce.

Attempts by SAGA Jerry Ramaker
to obtain union lettuce have so far
been uilsuccessful, so other types
of head lettuce will probablybe ser-
ved by SAGA. Passage of the re-
solution came after a week’s delay
while Huse Presnlents polled the
residents ot their halls During this
time supporters oi the boycott also
circulated petitions, which by the
end oi the week had gained morethan
a majority oi the study body’s sigr
natures.

Disruptions Cause Concern

by John Wylie

students and administrators evi-
denced growing concern this week
over numerous instances of “row-
dyism, public drinking, and high
noise levels in residence halls”.

was glad Peters was present site

and he likes the students". Leg~
gett did not ieel that Peters was at

”busting" anyone

Leggett is concerned about how
