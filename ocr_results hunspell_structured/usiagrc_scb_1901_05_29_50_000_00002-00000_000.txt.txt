as the collegiate year drarvs

to a close, many changes
occur in student organizations
Departing Seniors leave vacancies
which must be ﬁlled from the
ranis of rising rrnderciassmen,

preparatory to carrying on the
work of next year. SCARLET AND
BLACK falls heir to the Same an-
nual disturbance and the time is
now ripe for the present manage-
ment to step out of ofﬁce and
make known itS successors. The
two managers and the board could
conscientiously make the cus-
tomary statement of enjoyment
and proﬁt in the year'swork. But
as such statements are always a
part of this annual transition, they
will be omitted further than to say
that the staff in scurrying around
for news, writing it up “between
times,”and reading proof hasbeen
beneﬁted by this very limited en'-
perience of practical journalism,
and that if the reading public has
found in this semirweekly publical
tion information on Current events
creditably fresh and accurate, the
mission of the paper this year has
been fulﬁlied. As at no time
under the present management,
has the policy of SCARLET AND
BLACK been deﬁnitely set forth,
the public may be interested to
learn the precise aim of the paper.
From preceding statements it will
be seen that this is two-fold. First,
absolutely no one is barred or
even discouraged from trying to
get a place on the staff. Anyone
desiring to do work of this kind,
but lacking experience, is earnest-
ly invited to knock off the rough
corners by reporting for this col-
lege paper. The purpose of SCAR—
LET AND BLACK is educational as
much as is society work, and this
should be generally understood,
Ofcourse the opportunity isreaily
avery limited one,but ifimproved,
college journalism has often been
the stepping stone to a successful
entranceintothe newspaperworld.
Second, the. object of every paper
is to handle news. In this, SCARr
LET AND BLACK has been only pare
tiaily successful. Many barriers
must be constantly overcome.
Forinstance, ivhcn alumni become
lax about sending items it is very
difﬁcult to keep up a newsy alum-
ni column. Also, when all the big
papers in the state are immediate-
iy informed through private chan-
nels of thelatest move of the trusr
tees,but nota word of itivhispered
to this local college paper, it is
very difﬁcult, sometimes, to print
matters thoroughly uprtOrdate.
Of coulse the trustees and faculty
are busy people and have no time
to think of SC»\KLET AND BLACK,
but the college paper should be
considered a medium for com-
munication to the public so far as

possible. The members of the
faculty, however, have been most
willing to help the staff, rarely re-
fusing to give information. And,
by the way, the management has
discovered this year that the fac-
ulty is not that remote, naturally
hostile body so commonly conr
ceived by Freshmen. 1f ap-
proached in the proper spirit, it is
found that the faculty is willing
and anxious to help students, if
students will but make their wants
known. in handling news one
method has been steadily maili-
tained. Whenever the question is
asked, ”Who wrote suchrzmdrsuch
an article?" the invariable answer
is, "Some member of the staff."
The articles appearing in this
paper are never supposed to be the
dividual, but are the work of the
Staff as a whole. The managing
editor is responsible and all criti-
ciSmS should be made to him. In
its editorial capacity, the paper
occupies a unique and very cour-
ageous position. Studeiitcriticism
upon student organization, and
faculty as well, is often very pro-
nounced and SCARLET AND BLACK
feels called upon to reﬂect this
sentiment, But,naturally enough,
student criticism is not recognized
in the editorials, and the organir
zation criticised puts them down as
the personal venom and spleen of
the staff, or more likely the man.
aging editor. This is unfortunate,
but must be endured if the paper
is to continue an institiment of stur
dent opinion. The above sums up
brieﬂy the general working of the
paper.

Mr, John W. Gannaway has
proven himself to be fully capable
of controlling the paper nextyear.
He has worked faithfully and efr
Ficiently and fully understands all
the details of the paper. He has
been chosen as managing editor.
Mr. Charles F. Chase is a rustler
and will conduct the bustness af-
fairs of the paper. In these two
men, the present management has
complete conﬁdence and antici-
pates a most successful year. The
remainder of the Staff will not be
announced until next September,
but all present members will be
retained. The same faithful
support from the staff and the
same interest from readers are
earnestly besought for Messrs.
Gannaway and Chase that the
present managers have enjoyed
during the year just past.
