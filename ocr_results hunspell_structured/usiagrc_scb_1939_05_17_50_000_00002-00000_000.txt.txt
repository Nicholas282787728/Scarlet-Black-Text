THE GLEE CLUB CONCERT “

This Friday night the Men’s Glee club will
present its annual spring concert in Herrick
chapel. The concert will be the fmtyfifth
annual performance, the first one being
given in 1894. Any organization that can
boast that kind of a record must be good,
and the Glee club this year is worthy of the
tradition of the past. The members of the
club this year have planned their concert
to be the finest one of them all.

At this time of the year, most of us are
beginning to put in a good deal of time trys
ing to keep up with (or get ahead of) our
studies. We‘re all pretty busy, but most of
us can afford some time out Friday night
for a program as good as the concert pro»
raises to be.

GRINNELL'S FORGOTTEN MEN

Last night Grinnell's forgotten men, the
varsity debate squad, held their annual
dinner and presentation of awards in the
seclusion of Carney house dining room.
The event marked the official termination
of a season’s activity which caused scarcely
a ripple upon the campus. Beyond an
occasional trip to nearby schools, one or
two short broadcasts over neighboring radio
stations, and the entertaining of a few
schools here, little can be said for this year’s
debate activity at Grinuell. Instead of the
position it should hold, one of imagnition
and value, the varsity debate squad has
sunk to the place recently vacated by the
college bond, that of chief campus joke.
Just how much this unfortunate situation
is due to the traditional apathy of the stu-
dent body toward this activity and just how
far it can be traced to the inertia of the
squad itself is difficult to determine, but
one thing can be said with certainty: there
has been little encouragement offered the
squad by its sponsors to alter its position.
Little has been done by the debate leader-
ship to schedule debates in sufficient num-
bers or of sufficient worth to arouse the
debaters’ interest in setting forth their best
efforts or to arouse the interest of the stu»
dent body in supporting these efforts. Dc»
hates before high school audiences and over
small radio stations can not be expected to
create enough enthusiasm to gain support
for the activity; hence, the squad has

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

slipped.

Perhaps this attitude is the result of the
growing opinion of the activity’s leadership
that debate is a passing thing and that dis-
cussion is more valuable. if such is the
case, we have no quarrel with the opinion;
ollr objection is to the inertia to which the
opinion has led. if discussion is of greater
worth than the older debate, all well and
good; let’s have discussion

But, let’s have aggressively conducted
discussion; let’s have done witll this half-
hcarted method of carrying on our debate.
If we are to have an organization of this
type, let’s give it some encouragement
through increased support and greater
opportunity for activity to develop into a
worth-while group Let’s take the Glillnell
debate squad out of s rut.

WE KNOW Howhitus

(Reprinted from the Oberlin Review)

College newspapers are constantly criti-
cized because of their poor taste in handling
news. This point was emphasized iii a re—
cent speech made by William Mather Lewis,
president of Lafayette College, when he
made the following statement: “He (re-
ferring to the college editor) should realize

that freedom of speech is not license; that;

with writers and speakers of integrity there
is always the governing element of good
taste." The truth of this statement can-
not be denied, but we Should like to point
out that experience is the best teacher. The
best of us cannot go through life without
making any mistakes, and usually after one
has made a mistake every effort is made
not to repeat that mistake. Naturally if the
same error in judgment is repeated “'1th
cism is very mllch in order, Constant de—
structive criticism, however, is worth
nothing.

It has been quite consistently brought to
ollr attention that faculty members have
raked the “Review" over the coals for one
reason or another ill their classes. Very
rarely, however, is this cr'icism presented
at first hand to the ones who have aroused
the antagonism. It hardly seems in good
taste to stab the editors in the back by
dragging their work through the mud be-
fore gloups of thirty or i'ol'ty students win?
out giving them ally opportunity to defend
their stand. “With writers and speakers
of integrity there is always the governing
element of good taste.” If a statement has
been made in any part of the Review there
is some reason for its being there, and there
are facts to hack it up.

Another constant criticism leveled at the
Review is that its writers do not know the
basic principles of English. Occasionally an
instructor quotes a “Review” story as being
an excellent example of poor w1 ing. We
would like to point out that the largest per-
centage of reporters on the stai’ is made
up of freshmen wllo are taking English
composition during the period that they are
working for the “Review.” It might also
be in order to occasionally use a metropoli-
tan paper as an example of p001‘a\l‘r]tlng‘,
for college papers are not the only ones
guilty of such a misdemeanor. '

We do not believe that any concerted
action is being made on the part of the
facility to grind the “Review” into the dust,
but we would like to request that a little
thought precede some of the public cil
cism. Just what effect does the criticism
have upon those who hear it? Are they
not led to believe that college journalism is

a force which could easily be dispensed

with?

Whatever the reason may be for pre-
senting this criticism in class, it still would
seem to be very much in poor taste. Very
often there is ample reason for cl'ticism,
but we feel that this should be presented
either in an open letter to the editor or to
the editor in person. If the critic is sincere,
he will make every effort to see that the
cause of his criticism is corrected. If it is
simply a matter of disagreement, he should
be perfectly willing to voice his objections
through the some channels in which the
original statement was made.

Should America
Help Thieves

Battle Thugs?
—'By W.C.H._._

A recent compilation of returns
from the Gallup and Fortune polls
of American public opinion indi-
cate that whatever intelligence in
foreign affairs Johnnie Q. Public
might have gained from his ex
pcriencs in the World War is rap-
idly disappearing.

The swing from n sane neutral-
position in regard to the European
squabble to a hul'rah-for-John-
Bull—and-down-with-Hitler attitude
has been rapid and pl‘onounced.‘
According to the polls, nearly 70
per cent of the American public
favors giving all possible help‘
short of war to Britain and
France in case of their fighting
Germany and Italy. Furthermore,
over three-fifths of our citizens
indicate that they would join a
boycott of German goods, and 16
per cent of our population is out
ficicntly unbalanced to advocate
our sending troops to help His
Majesty’s government save its
imperial hide.

From these figures it would
seem that with twenty years to
reflect upon its experiences in the
World War, the American public
hasn't learned a thing. Once more
it is ready to go galavanting off
at the call of the collective scour»
ityists to play little Sir Galahad.
Today the interventionists’ hattlcsi
cry is to halt "the Fascist men»
stars which threaten to engulf
our democratic ideals and institu-
tions." And Johnnie Q. is swal»
lowing the bait.

But if only he would examine
the truth of that < lying cry, if
only he would realize how far it
is from the reality of the situa-
tion, he wouldn’t be so eager to
send his wealth and his suns
across the sea. if only he would
take the pains to discover that
Great Britain is far more inter-
estcd in saving her empire than
she is in saving democracy and if
only he would recall that We’re
still holding the bag from the
World War deal, he'd pause bev
fore he'd go poking about in
other people's fires. And it only
he'd realize that economic assis-
tance must ultimately lead to
doughboy assistance, he'd have but
scant courtesy for our jingoistic
interventionists,

News Views has been challeng-
ed to present the issue at stake
in the European question and, al-
though we are necessarily limited
as to space, that has been our
purpose. The issue is not, as our
enterprising Nazi-hater would
have us believe, democracy Versus
Fascism, but one gang of thieves
against another. We helped one
gang hijack the other's swag in
1917 and 1918 (and got double-
crossed in the end), although we
dressed it up in the pretty clothes
of “Saving the world for democ-
racy." Now, the bunch who got
swindled in 1919 want their booty
hack. and our former pnls are
again yelling for our help. Let’s
hope We have brains enough not
to give it to them.

OPEN FORUM

Dear R. w.
1 read with great interest your
letter about the great race held
every noon in the dorm dining
room. Your description of the
race was very fitting from your
point of w'ew.

It happens that I am a dorm
waiter, and have witnessed the
other side of the case. You are

’tbe waiters start to clear.

 

 

perfectly right in saying that the,

WEDNESDAY, MAY 17, 1939

boys spend ten minutes in the
dining loom grabbing and gulp-
ing. Naturally the table cloths
suffer in this onslaught.

It is only natural that I should
differ with several of the states
mcnts you made regarding our
conduct at noon, espeClally so be-
cause I believe that they are in-
correct. 1 do believe, as you said,
that the boys eat much too fast.
but 1 don’t believe that the wait—
ers are to be blamed for this.

The system used by the waiters
in the dining room depends en-
tircly on the diners. When the
head waiter sees that most of the
diners are through with the ser-
vice, he blinks the lights in the
dining room and the waiters clear.
or course there are always a few
who are still eating, and it is up
to these few to tell the waiters
that they want more.

Perhaps I may be out of place
in defending the worker against
the patron, but I would like to
present my suggestion. 1f the
diners would slow their eating a
little, the table cloths would not
require the constant changing;
everyone would be able to get as
much as he wants; and the com-
plaining might quiet a little.

If R. W. would notice‘the fcls

’iows around him some noon, 1

am sure that ha would find that
half of them are through eating
and have left the table before
If
R. W. is one of the few hungrier
boys, or one of the few that has
enough sense not to grab and
gulp when he wants more service
while the waiter is clearing, let
him speak up and I am sure that
the waiter will do his part.
