William Grecnwald is Business Man-
ager of this issue.

THAT FAMLVE.
"The world’s food reserves are low.
Upon the farmers or this coun-
t1y, theretme, in large measule, icsts
the rate of the nations .1 call upon
young men and old ahke and upon the
ablehodied boys of the land to accept
and act upon this duty#m turn in
hosts to the farms and make certain
. that no pains and no labor is lacking

in this great War.”
This appeal sent out by President

Wilson as a proclamation to the ne—
tion and in similar form by Governor
Harding to every newspape1 and may
or in Iowa, p1esents a serious problem
coon-outing America. statisticians
have already pointed out a threatened
Wolldwide famine. Its seriousness is

enormous.
The above appeal from President

Wilson shows in a laigc measmc how
the moblcm mnv be solved, —hy “tu1n1
ing in hosts to the ianns " As patriot-
ic a service can he done to the country
by joining the agr1cultural anny as
by enlisting with the military units.
Just how the colleges can add their
patriotic mite to the farm move may
not be very evident but there a1e
plenty of ways in which it may be
done. College men can study farming
along with their other Work and in
that Way can prepare to some small
extent for going into the country dur-
ing the coming vacation. Some others
can plant gardens while in college
The G1innell girls even, have already
stem ted to en1oll in gardening courses
and haie antedated the men in this

patriotic step
Much good can he done th1ough pub-

licity by college people. W1 itinv home
and encouraging otbe1s to plant gard—
ens will have considerable efiect.

There are probably others living on
falTﬂs who should leave college at once
to help plant the greatest ac1eagc p051
sihle. This is just as patriotic a move
as joining the allny and college credit
im the rest of the semester should he
forthcoming to those who undc1take
the 50.6115“. Kansas uuiyelsity dul‘lug
the past week over 150 college men
have left then studies fol the farm and
college cl‘etlil. until June has been
gladly given.

These are but a few ways in which
college men can help to p1 event a
worldwide Inmine. Their services will
do as much const1uotivc good in this
way as in any other.

The way these women are taking
hold ot the newspaper game is re-
markablc. Miss Helen Patterson is an-
othcr one to become editor of a big
college paper. she is at the head of
the Daily Kansan, or the University oi
Kansas, The men are having to
“hump" a little more than they used
to.

We are glad now that the songbirds
arrived eal‘lyiat least carly enough
to sing last night

.111 giving book lists last year the
department of Romance languages was
omitted The iollowlng has been sub-
mitted by Professor Sheldon from hot
department. The book lists which
were published by The Scarlet and

_ Black last year were submitted as the

best selection or hooks in cerium lines
or study, and selected by professors 111
these departments,

“It is practically impossmlc to give
even 11 meager list or the represents
tire writcrs in even the most import—
ant Hi the Romance Languages,
French, Spanish, and Italian, in the
space at command; and 111 mention of
the minor Romance litei-aturcs must
therefore be omitted,

“In French the following are sug-
gested. Half a dozen other good lists
might be made without exhausting the
possibilities;

“I. The folk—songs (seven volumcs
or collections in the college library.)

"2. The lyric poems of Ronsal‘d, du
Bellay, Baif, Lamartine, Hugo. Sully-
rrndhominc, Le Conte do Llsle.

“3. The old ‘Fai'cc de Mnitl'e Patee
lin,' the dramas oi Corncille, Moilere
Racine, two or three of Voltail‘e’s
tragedies, the comedies of Ueaumar—
chais, M. .l. Chenier's 'ehnrles IX,’
some plays of Hugo, Augier, Dumas
‘fils,’ Roslaud, Lavcndnn, Brieux, Her—
men.

"A. The novels or Huge, Balzac,
Flaubcrt, A. Daudct, with the short
stories of disupassaut, Daudet, and
Rene Bczin, and the allegorical rd
maucc or Anatole France entitled fL'ile
des Penguins,‘ with the plays, biogra—
phies, end the novel ‘Jean Christophe
of Romain Rolland,

”5. The essays of Montaigne, Pas—
ci's ‘Pensees.’ Vultuil‘e’s ‘Essai sur les
liloeurs,’ and his allegorical short sto-
rics, Rousseau’s ‘Emlle' and his po-
litical and sociological essays, Saber
tier's 1.11: at St. Francis of Assisi,’
Victor Cousin’s studies of the seven—
teenth century, Renan' s ’Rccollcctions
and ‘Sister Henrietta, Eugenie dc Gue
erin s ‘Journal, the ‘Memoil'es of Alon»
inc and the doc dc st. Simon; the let—
ters of Madame de Scrigny, the two
Balzacs, Voltaire, Merimee, and 13:11.
zac.

”In Spanish, us well as in French and
italinn, the folk-songs; the cycle at
'Cid‘; the plays at Calderon, Lope de
Vega, the two ilorctins, Gil y Zarate,
Galdos, Ecbegarzy, the ouiutcrc bro—
tier’s 'Lii't’ or st. Francts of Assisi,
Quixote,‘ the novels or onldcs, Valera,
Valdes, Fardo-Bazan, the Filipino Jose

rtiznl; the lyrics or Ruben Dario, Avel-
lalleda, De Heredia; the many ual‘l‘a—
tivc poems and historical studies of
the Chilean, p yian. and Mexicali
wi crs. The political and sociological
writings of Emilio Castelar and of
many South American writers well 1c
pay careful study.

“In Italian, all of Dante’s works, in—
cluding his letters, the poems of Far-
1111 Foseolo Leopaldi Giusti, and Gar»
ducci; the political studies and the
correspondence of ecsare Reccaria.
i'oscolc Cavoul, 111nm and anzlni;
the novels of Foggazzai'o, Matilde Sc.
rao, and the stories and studies of De
no D'Auunzio is too well known
to need mention.

"in all the Romance Languages, le
ters and memos are almost invai
ably good literature.”

Another step in G nnell' s system of
iuilitaly t aming was taken last Sat-
u1day morning when a class in who-
lcss telegrapl ' was organized by
Lloyd Taylor, instinctor in physics.
It is a recognized [act that in case oi
active walizue the Umted States will
need many new operators and this in—
struction w1ll place one in :1 position
who a he could ente1 a schcol of train-
ing for a few months and pass the ex-
aminations. Such work would bc very
interesting and the inducements {in
membership in the reserves are very
attractive.

The class in Goodnow ball will meet
eve1y Satuiday morning to1 an hour
trom 9 to in o clock. The time will be
equally divided between the study of
the theory and op ation or wireless
sets and code practice. It is hoped
that many will take advantage of this
opportunity to learn something of this
interesting subject All men or the
college are invited to attend.

“put one over” on a friend as

joke. But it is a serious matter to
sell clothes that way. For the joke always

Grinncll, Only the hestis incxpensiveﬁordlnary

Style is what you buy; you expect quality.
