Upon receiving my email, asking
for an inrerviov abo'ur her ‘zinc Fred/e,
Nancy Shore ‘01 was quick ro correcr
my embarrassing oversighr,

"FYI," she wrore, “The rirle is
FREC . s . the ride is an acronym
which srands for FENTIA’: (Eenria is
a name i made up ar rhis camp , . ,)
REVENGE on EXPLOITATIVE
COMMERCIALISM. Scc?"

Shore's personal convicrion on rhe
topic ofrnass marketing dares back so
high school when she remembers bc»
ing disgusred by popular magazines
such as Seventzin and 5mg.

“I scarred ro realize just how hor-
rible fashion magazines for reenagers
were. . . [rheyl are so appearance and
‘me' focused rhar rhen and now rhey
make me sick.”

More specifically, Shore was up
ser wirh rhe images of women pore
rrayed in rhe magazines.

“The women in rhose ads were
impossibly skinny, impossibly fcmi»
nine, and lose plain wrong. I hared
how rhose ads made me feel abour
myself: rhar I wasn'r prerry enough,
rhar it was only rhe ourside rhar mare
ecred," said Shore.

The firse issue of FREC rhar will
be our wirhin rhe ncxt few weeks is
20 pages long. Shore would like ro see
ir put our ar leasr four rimes per year.

Alrhough, ar presenr, she is rhe
only member ofsraff, Shore hopes ro
receive submissions from orher people
on campus.

“This magazine is nor iusr abour
wriring, it’s abour phorography, and
arr, and comics andad parodicsaswell

Part ofhcr inspirarion while crc»
aring FREc rhis pasr summer came
from her boyfriend, who gave her a
copy of a book, enrirled Marketing
Madness In facr, her ﬁrsl issue is
dealing mainly wirh rhe evils ofmass
markering.

“This issue covers rhe horrors of
fashion magazines (in rhe form ofad
parodies). commercialism, rhe ime
paer ofrhe media on people, ways in
which you can do somerhing your-
self, and alternarives ro spending Inn
of money,_and blindly following
capiralisr[ic] American values, ,

Shore’s idcas about [lk‘ affect of ‘

commcrcializcd America are obvious
and backed wrrh an alrnosr fierce
force.

“I am nor going to srand around

a ﬁght . . . I am sick ofour buy buy
buy menialiry. I am sick of our dc-
sttuction of th: carth and our lack of
respecr for most cveryrhing," said
Shore.

Looking pasr rhe first issue roward
r'he possible impacr ofher ‘zine, Shore
has specific goals,

“I wanr people ro read my maga-
zine and say ‘Héy, maybe I shouldn'r

For years, Grinnellians Escalating
AIDS Response (GEAR) has been a

Two key issues thar GEAR has
been focusing on recenrlyarc rhe Chi.

rhe Grinnell College campus,

The Chicago AIDS Walk, which
was held on Seprember 25, is a 10 K
walk that is held annually in order to
raise money for various AIDS—related
charities and services. This year
marked rhc fifrh time that GEAR has
parrieipared in rhe AIDS Walk, and
the 24 students and 20 alumni that
rook part in ir raised $495, which was
rhen donared to several organizarions
rhar provide hospiral services and
medical assistance

GEAR also works cxecnsivcly wirh
rhe Central lowaAle Projecr, lend»
ing a hand in several ways: rhey help
ourwirh their food panrry, raise funds
($2,000 last year), and bringing in
guesr speakers who relarc the realiries

Alrhough rhe resring will nor be a

Allerna’rive Break
sends students to
Colorado, Chicago

Grinnell’ssrudenraun Alrernarive
Break program has raken srudenrs
from San Francisco to Monrrcal to
washingron DC, and many places in
berween. Leaders plan and coordinare
communiry service trips for students
raking place fall and spring breaks.

Jenn Larimer ‘99 and Marr
Rhoades '99 say rhe rrips are very re»
warding. Larimer and Rhoades are
rwo members ofa board cfsix srudenrs
who oversee rhe rrips. “As rhe group
gets bigger, ir needs more organization
and ccnrral planning,” Rhoadessays.
The orher members ofrhe board are
Brad Hilkcnc ’99, Jeans Lim '00,
Molly Sreinberg '00, and Man Magec
‘01.

“Bondingwith rhe group I mer lors
offriends, people I wouldn't necessar—
ily have mer ourside rhe trip,” Rhoades
says, describing a main beneﬁt ofihe
rrips.

This fall, rrips are planned in Den»
ver, Chicago, and rhe Rocky Maul-ls
rains. “We were shocked as all rhe
peoplewho applied rhis fall,” larimer
says. “We don't know whar ro expect
unril we ger rhe applicarions, 0(th-
wise we would've rried ro include a
local rrip rhis fall." Local rrips are
more easily financed, which is one
defrnire concern ofrhe grpupa

More people rhan ever were inter-
esred in rhis year's fall break. It’s rhe
firsr rime rhar anyone has been ex—
cluded from rhe fall break, bur, in all,
27 people were rumed down. “The

selecrion is a lor of demographics,"
says Rhoades, They look as rhe ques-
rions and rhey srrive for a balance in
gender and class year in rhe members
ofeach group. Being over21 and will.
ing ro drive is also a bonus. A fairly
equal arrrounr ofpeople applied for rhe
Denver and Chicago rrips, while less
applied for rhe more limired Rocky
Mounrains rrip. Combined, rwenry
people will go so Denver or chicago,
while ﬁve will go ro rhe Rocky Moun»
rains.

The Denver group will be assiso
ing Habirar for Humaniry, building
houses or doing orher assigned rasks,

in inner-ciry Chicago, rhe group
will help our The Run, a shelrer that
provides rhe poor wirh food, shelrer
and elorhing.

In ehe Rocky Mountains, srudencs
will conrribure ro building rhe firsr
srupa in Norrh America, which is a
several-year-lorig projecr. A srupa is a
big shrine, a symbol of rhe Buddha's
or anorher sainrly person’s dearh. Stu-
dents brrng sleeping bags and sleep on
rhe floors or in basements ofrhe places
where they’re working.

“We usually manage ro make it
inro ar leasr one local paper," Larimer
says, "especially when Grinnell sru.
denrs seem ro have so much energy
and enrhusiasrn."

“All ofus wane ro conrinue no see
Alrernarive Break grow in a manage»
able fashion," Larimer asserrs,

“Whar we really need are good—
quality leaders ro organize rrips for
spring break. . .Wc‘ll srarr planning
and recruiring leaders rhe week after

fall break." Aleernarive Break organizes
more rrips during rhe spring, when
usually more people wanr ro parlici-
pare.

A leadership applicarion process

exists for students who are interested. '

The leaders responsibiliry is in propose
thcir idea ofa worthwhile cause and
where ro go ro accomplish it, keeping
limltcd funds in mind. A leader musr
establish conraer wirh a sire and plan
rransporrarion and food (which is usu-
ally obrained from rhe Dining Scr-
Viccs). Th: leadets also fund-raise to»
gerher. “Not ro menrion rhe responv
sibiliry of being in charge," Larimer
says, “being rhe leader on rhe rrip. It’s
a grear experience.”

"people who work ar rhese places
can be very inspiring," Rhoades coni—
menrs, “wherher they’re running a
homeless shelrer or doing somerhing
elsc."

“Another advanrage ofrhe program
is rhar ir inspires people ro delve more
inro community service projeces when
rhey’re done,” Larimer says. This is
parr ofwhy rhe organization doesn‘r
require pasr communiry service so par-
ricipare on rhe breaks. “We wanr ro
be available to those who haven't done
