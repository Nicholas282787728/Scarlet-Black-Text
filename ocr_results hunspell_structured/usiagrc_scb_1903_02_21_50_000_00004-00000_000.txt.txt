itiries it has been the head center
ot AilglOrS vnn education and
is prohahly the best possible
place to bring students together
from all parts ot the world
Another essential part of the
scheme is the provision tor choos-
ingthe students who are to re
cerve the scholarships: These
men are to be men in every sense
of the world, distinguished for
their mental, moral and pltysical
capacities. Whatever may be the
criticisms oidetails of the scheme,
or the character of its author, it is
certainly worthy ot respect as a
gigantic attempt to accomplish a
good purpose, the softening and
destroying oi national prejudices
and differences. The outcome
of the plan will be watched with

interest all over the world.

only been ahletu meet the team
once or twice and is too busy
with outside matters to give them
the time he would like to devote
to the debate. Various other
things have happened to retard
thcwork and the men feel that
little has becnaccomplished. The
debate is now only three weeks
off and the wolk is tar from being
in satisfactory condition, How
