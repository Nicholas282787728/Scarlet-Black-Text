“1th like being aﬂoat in tangled burlap," said
Jessica Saidian ’06, in response to the complicated
emotional power of the William Kentridge exhibit in
Faulconer Gallery. Kentridge, a South African artist
who creates powerful social commentary in multiple
media. The exhibit brings a diverse collection of
prints—simultaneously realistic and primitive, bold
and detailed, set on unconventional backgrounds
from dictionary pages to vinyl records, to Faulconer
Gallery for a comprehensive exhibition.

"Almost every type of printmaking is represented
in this Show," said Kay Jenkins, the exhibit’s cura-
tor. Although Kentridge is a proliﬁc printmaker,
this is his first exhibition made up entirely of
prints Jenkins first experience with him was at the
Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, where she
was enthralled by his short films. ”I went to see an
exhibit of African liberation art, and I never made
it, because I got stuck on Kentridge’s Work,” she
said. ”And I kept coming back to it every weekend
and bringing other people with mel”

Jenkins was so interested in Kentridge’s work that
she traveled to his South African home and studio
to pick works to exhibitin Faulconer. "He had prints
everywhere," she said, ”stored in bedrooms, drawers,
all around his house." The selection process was a
difficult one but in a Collaborative effort, Jenkins

and Kentridge chose a collection filled with pnwer~
ful images of social consciousness for display.
Kentridge’s work reflects upon the South African
experience of apartheid and social change during
the 19805 and 19905. The brutal truth of his Segre-
gated world shines through in his works, “Art In A
State of Grace/Hope/Siegel" This series was made
to be displayed during South Africa’s Centennial
Celebration by a group of protesters, The final print,

”Siege," depicts a grotesquely fat white bureaucrat.
Underneath this image are the words ”London is a
Suburb of Johannesburg." The hideous excess of the
man’s face is both indicative of his privileged place
in South African society and substitutes for all the
fat, mean faces of the world. “It’s freeing because
some of his works have a fuzzy emotional effect
but then the political meanings behind them are so
powerful," said Saidian.

In addition to looking at South African legacy,
Kentridge looks at the legacy of printrrnaking in
many of his works, He reworks a set of William
Hogarth prints displayed in the library basement
entitled "Industry and Idleness.” He turns Hogarth's
set on its head by setting the story in Johannes-
burg, and having the idle character succeed and the
industrious character fade into obscurity because of
forces of class and race beyond their control.

”When I saw Kentridge's works, I thought that
they had to be in our collection," said Jenkinst
”Like many of the other works we have by artists
like Goya and Hogarth, Kentridge uses the etching
stylus as a weapon against injustice, inequity, and
human folly... you have to work in order to
understand these prints. Vou have to bring some»
thing to them.” But, one may well come a way with
something tool “I will be haunted by these images
in a good way," said Saidian,
