semi-finals in the tournament and the final
went to a shootout," said Senior Captain

pened to he a clutch team in both shootr

Men’s and WOmen’sXC
bring home another gold

liY CHLOE MOKVL

Even with inches of mud slowing the
pace. the Men’s and Women’s Cross Counr
try teams crossed the MWC Championships
finish line and emerged victorious, with a
conference this and a ticket to the regional
competition awarded to both teams.

On Saturday, Oct. 31, the Grinneil Men’s
Cross Country team won their 13th confer-
ence title in a row, making their total league
titles 26 In a come fr-om behind victory, the
Womens team also ﬁnished first, making this
win their lérh league title total

When the teams arrived at the course the
day prior to [its race to evaluate and gel a
feeling for the course, conditions weren't ex—
actly ideal for competition.

“When you were a kid, did you have a
slipvn-slide? Yeah, It was like that.“ Dan
Krauss ’12 said. Heavy amounts of rain the
day before had made the course extraordis
narily muddy, leaving inches of mud on the
runners’ shoes as they attemptcd to run the
course.

Luckily, having time to scout out the
courses the day before allowed the runners to
mentally prepare themselves for the race day,
which aetually ended up being better condis
tions than they expected

“The day before we ran the course just [0
see the conditions and it was about 10 times
worse than it actually ended up being,” Leah
Russell‘ll said. “I think it changed ollr men—
talities a lot because people started freaking
out in the beginning saying that you had to
go out super hard because you wouldnt be
able to pass people but then as we got closer

to the race we realized that it wasnt going >

to he that different, people started to calm
down, we just had to talk about how to take
the turns and how to get around it,"

Clearly. preparation paid off, On the
men's side, Purple Iioo runners finished four
out of the top live. Dan Krallss ’12 sealed .1

first place finish in a time of 26:42.13 with
teammates directly behindiNoah Delong
Y12 in secondV Alex Reich '11 in third and
David Montgomery’lo in fifth.

“The four of us—Monty and 1 and Alex
and Noah—all really
showed that we're ready
for regional's in the eon-
ference race," Krauss said,

But the core four
weren't the only ones to
perform well.

“[Mike] Gallagher
['10] really stepped up on
a course that~wcll let's
just say you wouldn't re-
ally cxpecl Gallagher to be
a hill runner,” Krauss said.
“He really worked hard
and had a great race a lot
ofother guys were up with
him and we're confident as a team that we
can win rcgionals."

However, while the Roos were slated to
win, the Women’s teamithe Skull Crushr
ersﬁvas completely surprised with their
first place finish at the conference awards
ceremony,

“Nora [Coulter '10] saw [Coach Evelyn
Freeman] trying and was like,‘Why is Evelyn
erying you gaysv and she went up to Evelyn
and was like,‘Is everything okay?’."Whitfleld
said, “We were all thinking,‘M.1ybe Evelyn’s
really proud ofus because we got second."

This disbelief in their win stemmed from
the fact that the Skull Crushers weren’t the
favorites going into the race.

“On paper it looked like Carroll was
between 15 and 20 points ahead of second
place which was as and wc were one point
ahead ofMonlnouth and they were just a few
poin read of St. Norbert," Head Women's
Cross Country coach Evelyn Freeman said.
“But we know that we hadn’t shown our full

strength and so we had talked about this and
we knew it was going to be an uphill battle
but we all had to come through.”
And com: through they did.With Russell,
Hannah coulter and Maja Gamble ﬁnishing
sixth, seventh and eighth
respectively, in addition to
Whitfield’s 20th place fin-
ish and Sasha Dunbar '13
in 2151, the Skull Crushers
had just enough points to
earn first place.
“They announced third
and second and it was like,
‘We did it we did itl'"
Rachel Whitfield '10 said.
“It was such a team effort
and it was so special to

. have us both up here and
each ofthe teams getting a
first place trophy."

But both teams didn’t get to celebrate for
long. as they had ro keep practicing and pre-
paring for the regional competition, which
rakes place this Saturday at Grinnell’s home
course at Oakland Acres Golf Course,

Practices this week and the week prior
have been fairly similar to the intensity of
regular season pmctices, as neither [Cams
are necessarily tapering for the event, but
are strategically curring back to ensure that
they’re ready to run their best come Saints
day moring. "We're not changing too much,
we're taking a little bit offTuesday's workout,
which is a speed day,”l(r.1llss said, “Just drop-
ping the volume a little so we feel really fresh
and perky come Saturday."

So come watch the cross countrv teams
storm regional: this Saturday at Oakland
Acres. Shuttle buses will be leaving from the
PEC beginning at 9 a m and Will shuttle
back and fourth every half hour, The men
compete at 11 am and thc women's team
competes at noon.
