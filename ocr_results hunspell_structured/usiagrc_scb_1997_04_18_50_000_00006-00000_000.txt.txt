doubleheader
that was
snowed out
last Saturday.

the two days.

games thus far, the tournament will
give the better teams a chance to
distance themselves from the field,
We are 1-3 in the conference so we
must make up some ground,"
Coach Hollibaugh pointed out.

A cause of concern for Grinnell
is the illness of catcher Kevin
Humiston ‘97 who might not be
able to play in the tournament

more and people
