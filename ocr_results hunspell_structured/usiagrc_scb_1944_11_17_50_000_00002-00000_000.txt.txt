War Council Replies - -

(Editor's Note: The following editorial was
written by Lucy Trowbridge. chairman of
the war service council, in coniunclion with
the council and the members of the home
management class.)

The members of the War Council read with
interest and much surprise the lack of uni
derstanding of the scope alld spirit of their
war service program as displayed in last
week’s editorial.

Tile underlying theme of this resents
ment seems to be directed against the idea
of compulsion in regard to taking a war
activity. This, unfoltunately, is an erron»
eous idea generally presumed to be incurred
and heightened by a misunderstanding of
the qualifications for exemption.

It has never been officially stated either
orally or in print that participation in a
war course is compulsory. However, it is
so strongly expected by the faculty and ad—
ministration that it is a requirement as it
works 0th in practice. At the same time
this differs strongly from an academic re-
quirement, for though there is general dis-
approval of nonsparticipation expressed by
faculty and students alike,‘there is no aca-
demic penalty for failure to contribute to
this program of service.

An often heard complaint based on a
false conception is ~“so-and-so doesn’t take
a war activity so why must I? I have the
same major as she!" Exemption i not
based on a student’s major. Only indi idual
exemptions are granted, following a formal
petition stating reasons for such a request.
Decisions involved in granting this petition
are based on three principle considerations:

1, The health of the individual.

2. Number of hours of employment

3. Responsibility of major student of-

fices.

It would be impractical to say that a
major in one department has more work
to do than in some other department. There-
fore, if someone who is exempt is a music
major» for example, it is only incidental to
the actual facts.

A brief review of the war euthenics
courses should clear up the obvious ignor-
ance which exists about their true value.

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

It should be immediately explained that
even though a small minority of girls have
been allowed to substitute a euthenics
course for war activity, they are not and
never have been classified war courses them—
selves, and therefore cannot be justly con-
demned for not fulfilling the implications
of the term "war."

However, a collrse such as home man—
agement which teaches girls to live on a
budget ,especially in times of rationing, is
certainly a tangible aid toward the war
effort.

The crafts class, to mention another, is
in part introductory to work done by gray
ladies and other groups in occupational
therapy.

The League of Women Voters alld Post
War Seminar are two organized discussions
groups which educate for the future. The
former is affiliated with the national group
of very high repute and by means of study
teaches women to participate intelligently
in the government of our country. The war
somehow seems closely associated with these
problems of government, so possibly ,this
needs no further enlightenment. The Post
War Seminar, on the other hand, concerns
itself mainly with the particular issues i .
volved in planning the peace and construct
ing a post war world. Discussion groups to

which everyone contributes are led by fnc-‘

ulty members and are planned with the
view of obtaining a better comprehension
of the background characteristics and prob-
lems existing in foreign countries. We are
the ones to whom responsibility of )cst—war
plannin will be given, and an intelligent
and efﬁ ent evaluation of all phases of the
subject might prove useful.

The remaining six courses are under di-
rection of the Red Cross. The office aides
who assist the Grinnell chapter with reg
ular office work and the publicity aides
who compile and edit the Red Cross bulletin
are doing work urgently needed and re
quested. The 27 office aides alone put in
54 hours a week of hard work for the down-
town office. Surgical dressings has a simple
alld direct enough connection with the war
to convince even the least discerning of its
benefits,
course nationally considered worthwhile and
recommended to those taking life saving and
nurses’ aide.

The work of the nurses’ aide has re-
ceived praise and sincere expressions of
thanks from the entire country Due to
the critical nurse shortage in civilian hose
pitals, the burdensome routine tasks have
been appropriated by nurses’ aides, releas;
ing flllly trained nurses for the specialized
work they are qualified to do. Every nur-
ses’ aide pledges 105 hours of work a year
after her 80 hour training program is come
pleted. This is not an activity she would
be doing in peace time, and is a sacrifice
that shouldn’t be too subtle for a person of
college intellect to grasp,

Even the mere suggestion that men
should take part in this schedule seems
the height of unpatriotism. If any of you
have forgotten, it is the men who have,
are, or soon will be giving more than we
ever may attempt here at home.

Such a program as described above
seems more than a mere “pretense" at
contribution and to embody a little more
service that the expression “wasted repe-
tition" would indicate.

ception for Anne Brown after her
