The World According to
Shorts (2006) -‘
Some ups, some downs to six in
ternational short films‘ 3;

T/JU War/ii Arml'iil/lg fr S/Im/J is an intriguing.
though uneven, collection ol’lntelnational short films.
While each short has some outstanding quality to
recommend it, few achieve a coherent whole.

La Perm

The first ﬁlm, La Per-m from Chile, features a
conniving couple who depend on elaborate fantasies
concerning their innocent maid to fulﬁll their own
empty lives, Although the moralizing against the
spoiled middle class that preys on the less fortunate
is somewhat overdone, strong performances from the
small cast and clever cinematography overcome the
clichés of the narrative.

We Have Decided Not to Die

The Australian We Hm}: Detidrd Not to Dit'
also suffers from ttiteness, in this case in the syn-r
bols department. Water cleanses and spurs rebirth,
and breaking windows transcend the boundaries of
timﬁthese images are nothing new. However, this
short showcases the unlimited potential of the camera,
speeding and slowing the film at different moments,
creating mirror images, and employing unusual cam-
era angles to produce a visually exciting work orarr.
Most People Don '1 Care

The strongest offering, Mail Flip/U Dim) Care,
is from Norway With dark comedy, a capable cast
and rousing refrains of socialist anrhcin “The Inter-
nationale", the director Hans Fetter Moland presents
a thought-provoking existentialist poitrait of a group
ofold friends court-outing the ravages orrime and the
indifference ofcontcmpotary society
Al‘lflC/Il‘lxt .

The unique beauty of Moi! People Don‘t Cine is
put into iclief since it is followed by the weakest short,
the dismal Polish Ali/illii'il’l, which is as unsubtle as
the title suggests, The classic theme of the corrupting
bully has potential for emotional resonance, reflecting
the perils of childhood, but here it is buried under
heavyrhandcd allegory. it's a poor man’s (and poor
director's) Lord of the Flies.

The Old Woman ’5 Step

Next is the Brazilian TIM Old Warn/171': Sir/3. Similar
in theme to Most People Don't care, it has a gentle,
quiet tone that emphasizes the unassuming nature of
the film and title character. Realistic in its document
taty—like style and portrayal of poverty,it nevertheless
leaves the satisﬁed viewer with a sense or hope
Ring of Fire

The compilation ends with the animated Ring of
Fire from Germany. The narrative is convoluted, but
redemption is round in its moving ending and inno-

Vertigo (1958)
*tttrﬁi

Hitchcock delves into psyche

Vertigo, The name conjures up images or peril-
ous heights and steep inclines, but Hitchcock delves
much deeper into the mind than simple actophobia
(fear crlieighrs).

The main character, Johnny (Jarnes Stcwarl),is an
ex-cop who retires after he develops a severe case of
vertigo when a fellow officer falls to his death. An old
college buddy, Gavin (Tom Helmore), reads about his
friend’s retirement and hires him to follow his wife
Madeleine (Kim Novak). Gavin doesn't believe she’s
having an affair, he simply rears for her safety, She
has been experiencing moments of memory loss and
wandering around in confusion. Gavin believes that

Counres'rt l“1‘?://W\i\’WrNEV‘VYORKERFlLiVlSCOM

she is being possessed by a ghost who committed sui»
cidc in life, andjohuny soon fears that Madeleine will
do the same,

The supernatural plays a prevalent role in Vertigo,
but don‘t confuse this With a horror film, Hitchcock's
ultimate purpose is to sound the depths ofthe human
psychoThc film does more than confront the fear of
heights It takes a close look at how 31‘in and shame
can blind someone to the reality surrounding them,

The film starts out inteicsting but not really excite
ing, despite the unusual supernatural elements. The
ﬁlm quickly pulls you in once the plot begins to take
unexpected turns. Hitchcock has quite the under-
standing or how the human mind works, especially
when it comes to terror and guilt. .

This psychological depth combined with the
ghost srory makes this less a horror film than a gothic
film. Although the supermniral elements are prevar
lcut, you can never really be sure if they are real. After
all, Madeleine could simply be crazy.

Unfoitunately, the film's conclusion didn't work
for me, mostly because it seemed a little abrupt Res
gardless, I'll still give this psychological thriller with u
Iiiiit ofthe supernatural four stars out offive.
