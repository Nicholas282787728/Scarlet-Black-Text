potty, a version ofrh: famous rarely, was lanyarsold Lee Buchanan's
“ﬁrst actual movie.” Although rhc ﬁlm, created the summer before
Buchanan entered high school, is “ﬂill a favorite," rhe Grinnell High School
senior has since progressed in his himmaking, winning an award, submitr
ting ﬁlms to the Grrnnell college Film Festival and planning For a future
in rrlnimokr ng.

Buchensu started making films in seventh gradeA teacher at the mrddle
school allowed him to use a camera and edlLing ngurpmenr. He worked
wrth other srudonrs and just “had run shooting scutiwrth the camera."

After learning the basics, Buehenru frequently made
ﬁlms forschool proycers. “i rmil'lcd I was deﬁnitely in»
rcrcsrcd in ring," he said.

Bucl‘icnau won third place in rh: Iowa Educational
Media Association Student Media Fmival for a film he
made during his sophomore year nrhrgh school. The
ﬁlm was a music video that contained clips oinpproxi.
marely 25 songs that together toldo story.

Buchanan mmntly submitted two ﬁlms lo the Grin-
ncll College Film Festival. whose winner will show to-
nighr in Harris. From I/u’ Waterford; is a black and white
silent movie Buchanau made during a rwo-wcck film
(ins: last summer in Burlingron, Vr. The assignment
was (0 “capture the essence ora place without disturbing it," hosard.

Buchcnrlu filmed Lakc Champlain from 7 sum. to noon one day, “can-
didly" capturing people and boats. As the day were on, the water-iron:
wont irom quiet to bustling, he said. “And the water plnyed a key roll in
the ﬁlm. "

Buchemu ﬁlmed Four Par-1m [gel/ll“: Wrr/Im after reading Tlrr Color
Purple in an English class this year. His English teacher gave him a packet
otWalkor's poems, and he drose four ro represent in short film segments.
To do so, Buchanau wrote down rhe images Lhzl came to mind immedi-
ately upon reading the poems and made short ﬁlm segments based on
(hose images.

The four segments were in borh black and whirc and color, and some
were wide screen while others were not. Walker’s poems were read in the
background. “i wanted to [represent] different images and different ways
to compose and color mom," Buchenau said.

Biichenau said he probably warm to go to a “regular college or
university" with a ﬁlm program Right now, he is considering
Webster Universiry in st. Louis.

He mighr also attend a him school durrng the
summer months to rake short courses, he
said. He has looked inro the New York
Film Academy and the lntcrnz—
rional Film and Television Worka
shops in Rockporr, Marne.

Filmmaking is also in the pier
ture for Buchcnau post-collage. “I
dehrritelydo wont to continue wrrh
ﬁlmmaking," he said, “bur l don’r
want to wind up near Hollywood."
instead, Buchenau hopes to meet
other people inremrcd in him in
the future and got involved in km
independent proiorrs

“i wouldn't like to go to Holly
wood and he a rlunky all my hie,"
he said. “I'm inrcresred in somcdting
smaller”

Buchcnau enjoys horh the artistic and social aspects orhlrnmslcing.
Most ortho people who star in and work on the ﬁlms he is involved with
are his trrends, meaning ho geu to spend time with his friends and have
“something ro Show for it." “They like doing it," he said. “Andi like doing
it.

Buohenau likes the process and ﬁnished product when creating a ﬁlm.
“i like ro take a goal and work towards it,” he said.

Buchcnau also enjoys showing his ﬁlms to audicnoes. Ha primarily
does so in his classes or rho high school. “I don'r play much on roll in
some classes," Buchanan said. Therefore, rho erhtrsrudonrs In those classes
can “learn a lot shour' him by seeing his ﬁlms. “in something to share
with them." Bucherrau said.

Buchenau'x favorite movies rncludeWcsAndcrsori’s
ﬁlms, such m Riurrwrrre and ﬁre Royal Tmmrrmmr. “A
lot nrrndopendont ﬁlms are grim, violcnrand bizarre,"
Buchanan said. “That's not somerlrrngl have interest
in." instead, Buchanan is interested in creating unique.
ofhseat characters who "aren't necessarily violent or dis.
rurbcd." He describes Anderson’s ﬁlms~nnd his
own—us more “upbeat" than many Independent ﬁlms.

Buchenau also appreciates the work of Japanese
ﬁlmmaker Akira Kurosawa and producer/director
Cameron Crow: (/my McGuire and Arman Fammr).

Buchanan's two favorite movies areAlmarlFamam
and rem/imam. “They're about kids who had uninition who wanted to go
out and do things. pursue their goals, make
names for themselves," Buchcmusajd.

“I relared ro thorn."

runny. I’d have to say that Bucky is my favorite character,
hut it's a tough choice." 2) ”I took this black and white
photo at Redwoods state Park outside San Francisco, cal. in
really into photography, and this photo keeps my wall from

being ugly and white, which I don’t like.” a) “it’s a blue
rug. it’s really, really nice and was given to me by the
gracious tamily of my girlrriend, Amie hagerty '05.” A) "i

 

 

have multiple cotree makers. One is for hot corree, and one's
tor cold. 1 go through one and a hair gallons of cold coffee a
week. It's scrumptious. Also, I can't have drinks in Don
Smith’s class, so I have to he ahle to put my roiiee in a
rialgene bottle. [old coffee goes better in a iialgene, trust
me,” 5) ”I built this loft over the summer. The design is
iron the Orgy hroot loitbed Company, 1 actually got the
design trom the dad or my girlfriend. She has the same hed.
its a really sturdy bed, but i need to find a wrench to
tighten some or the polls." 6) "i like my chair hetause its
