You might have
noticed that the vast
majority of the
newspaper articles this
week pertain to a certain
brand of beverage. This
might be because I
Signed a seven-year
binding contract with
the coca-Cola Company
stating that the Scarlet
and Black would print
only Coke-based articles
in exchange tor cooler-
looking vending
machines and a cage full
of soda-toting baby
polar bears. Or it might
be for some other
reason.

Either way, this
whole beverage
controversy made me
wonder why some
colleges and universities
Embraced Coke while
others, like Grinnell,
would rather choose
which heartless
corporation to buy drinks
from (for instance, some
prefer the products or
those capitalist bastards
at Snapple). Why would
some campuses proudly
represent Coke while
others protest and
boycott it?

My research led me
to Emory University in
Atlanta, Georgia, a
school that is lovingly
referred to by its
students and faculty as
Cocacciila University.
After reading the history
behind Emory and Coke's
relationship, it was all
too clear to me why they
love Coke and why
everyone there has those
vague, unfocused eyes.

Emory’s relationship
with Coke began in
1895, when the owner of
the Coca-Cola Company
sent his son (who
attended Emory College)
a sample of the new
product. Now, there are
two key differences
between Coke then and
Coke now. First of all,
one did not buy Coke by
the bottle, but by the
keg. Secondly, until
1905, Coke used to
contain cocaine.
Therefore, one can
imagine that when the
keg of laced Coke
showed up on Emory’s
campus, it went over
pretty well. 50 well, in
fact, that Emory hamed
its business school after
the guy and the guy
gave Emory 105 million
dollars.

What can Grinnell
learn from this? I'm not
quite sure. Would
Grinnell students sell
their morals and social
consciousness for 105
million dollars and some
fortiﬁed novelty kegs? I
know I would. But not
tor a drop less.
