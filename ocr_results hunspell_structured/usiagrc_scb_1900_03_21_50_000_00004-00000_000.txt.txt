Junior Annual.
tConlinlicrl lmln Fitst Page.)

The book, perhaps, will not be
so large as some "Annuals" have
bch,o\villg to the exclusion of
that cataloguing clcmcnt which
has hitherto made up the bulk of
our “Annuals,"hut what it may
lack in this way we hope may be
more than compensated by the
character and presentation of
more interesting matter.

We are fortunate in securing for
an artist. Mr. Herman Bowman. ol
the Cinctnnati Art School. The
engagement ot Mr. Bowman will
insure sotncllllng new and original
in style and conception of draw-
ings. From what work Mr. Bow-
man has alleady done we feel jns-
tiﬁed in saying that thc sketches
and caricatures will be rnlly up to
the standard of the best artistic
work which has appeared in Iowa
College “Annuals,"

It cannot be deﬁnitely stated
as to when the "Annual" will be
completed, but it will probably
come out shortly before come
mencement. Further announce
innnts will he given later.

Scientific Association.

The [lrngzlam or the Gnodnow
Scientiﬁc A<sociatlon last Muir
rlay evening: was opened by a rec
vletv by McIntosh on the subject.
"Dark Lightning." This is a phe-
nomenon which was thought to
have been observed in nature, but
experiments have that
there is no such thing in nature.
These experiments were made by
photographing the ﬂash and dem~

Clark took as a subject tor re—
view, "Small Pox.” This disease
receives its name from the packs
or pustules which characterize the

 

disease. Its origin is unknown.
The disease is diffused over the
entire world. It is probably mi-
crobic in its nature and is very
Contagious. Two kinds of the dis
case are (llslingulshch-namely.
discrete and conﬂuent, the latter
being the most dendly otall Cllfr
EEISGS. ,

Prof. Almy gave an instructive
tail: on “SpchO-Phutomelcry'"as
it is applied to the measurement
of iltlellslty of illlllilinlltinn. Sev-
erlll different ltllms of the Photo»

attention was given to a new sys-

Last Saturday evening the very
hospitable home oi Prot. and Mls
R. G. Cole was again the scene at
testtvtty. On this particular occa-
sion the Amphlun orchestra and
Cnngl‘egdttntlal church choir were
the haunted guests.

The pleasantly
spent in conversation. The pics
slice of the betterhalves of the
tnilrried lllelnbet‘s of both orches-
tra and choir added much to the
enjoyment of the occasion.

Coffee and cake were served in
the dining room by members or
the conservatory, Miss Ethel
Cox presided over the pineapple
trappe bowl in an adjoining room.

Several former members of the
Choir and orchestra were present.
Both the orchestra and choir ap
preciate the privilege so kindly
glven them by Prof. and Mrs. Cole
of meeting in a way so different
fromtheii customary meeting, and
at the same time so pleasant.
