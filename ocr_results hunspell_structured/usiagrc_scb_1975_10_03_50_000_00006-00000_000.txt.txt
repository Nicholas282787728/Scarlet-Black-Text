Freshpersons
to dominate

by Robert Meyer

in the early seventies, Grinnell
students felt that athletics were
dehumanizing. That trend of
thought has dissipated, however;
witness the percentage of fresh
persons ivho turned out for fall
athletics.

Cross country has twentyone
people competing ior ﬂ’le twelve
available spots, fifteen are fresh—
persons, The women have eight
runners, and only two are up»
perclasswonien. Uniortunately,
only two of the new women have
experience in competitive running.
Coach Obermiller feels that the
inexperienced women have good
quality, and he also feels that the
women‘s team is perhaps better
than last year’s crew of veterans.

0n the men’s team, the freshmen
are mostly experienced runners.
Five of the seven runners Will be
freshmen, featuring two in the top
two spots. The men’s team looks
forward to a successful future with
their impressive array of fresh
men. ‘

The turnout for the football team

was incredible this year, Of the
lilty-iour people on the team,
fifteen are freshmen. This turnout
by the freshmen didn’t satisfy all
the coaches expectations.
however, as they were hoping that
nine other prospective lreshrnen
would come out. According to
Coach Maurice Hunt, almost all of
the ireshmen will be seeing con
siderable action this season. Since
injuries are a common occurrence
in football, it is likely that all the
freshmen players will get a taste of
Midwest Conference football.

Alter the excellent perlormance
by last year's soccer team, Coach
Plitsch expected some very
talented players for the '75 season.
Eight oi the twentyeseven memr
bers on the squad are ireshrnen, At
least two of these newcomers will
start, and the rest will see a sub
stantial amount of action. If in
iuries occur it is likely that a fresh-
man \vill fill the vacancy. Coach
Pfitsch feels that. the lreshmen
have given his team depth and
better team play.
