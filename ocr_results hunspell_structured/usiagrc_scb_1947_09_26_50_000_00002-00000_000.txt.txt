Tennis Tight Spoi’

Once again we return to the campus
and once again we see the tennis courts in
the same deplorable condition. Since last
Le saw the courts, our outlook toward
them has changed somewhat.

Studying costs of construction and h' *
labor costs, we realize that it woilld be (lllllc
c'-lt to put in new cement courts and to
resurface all the old courts,

However, knowing the manpower avail~
able on campus and the rates of pay for stu-
dent help, we do not believe it would be at
:i‘l costly or inconvenient to hire perhaps
1" o students to take care of our present
collr s. They could water, roll and lille the
. ‘ - day at a cost of not more than

1; dollars per day

A point to consider at this time is the
tL-llnis team. In the past two years Grinnell

acquired through no fault of its own

ll of towers best prep tennis players, Bruce
gley, number two high school player in

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

1946, and Joe Popple, high school rlolihlesl
Champion in llllv. i

This next spring tlle conference lncot‘
will be held at Grirrnell, and, it we ever have
a chance to win the conference title, it will,‘
be next spring. All our players ask is decent
courts on which to practice.

Welcome, STrangers

As another year ilr Grilrnell’s education—
:ll history starts, a new group makes its ap-
pearance on the campus. The freshman
class, or the Class of ’51, as it will be krrolrn
to posterit ‘, has struck the campus with tllc
impact of a fresh wind. ,

Every freshman female has a Ionlzl
skirt, and every freshman male a pipe, and
that’s the way it should be, Any institutiml
is only as good as its youngest members, for
they give it continuity, and these members
are obviously trying to get the spirit. 11’
they don’t know it by now, they are wel-
collie at Grilrnell. May they findarich life
here, and linger long to enjoy it.

One thing the newcomers lnust under—
staml. however. They constitute but a prom-
ise to this institution. They must prove‘
their worth before they gain acceptance to
many of the privileges which go with cul-
lxe'e lil'e. They must undergo a period of

l spcdion”, as it were, so as to bett - fit
them for the mental, moral, and spiritual
building program of the college. Brit the
fact remains that they are the lnmdsomest
rand most cooperative group seen here f
years. 11' every indication is right, they will
make a great class.

The biggest reason for the quick as~,
sinrilation of freshmen is tlle fine 101%
New Strident Days program, Those in:
charge of the program deserve a great deal‘
of credit for making it a tremendous sr

‘pai'tlcipatc in various conl’ornncnsl

 

cess. Group leaders were chosen with care. '

and the right ones were evidently found, furl
they handled their charges with every cone:
sidcration. Most of the activit s werel
smoothly managed, and all were run uith‘
the best intentions. The get—acquaintedl
gatherings had more success than ever,l
which was the result 01 thorough planning:

and preparation on the part of the sponsorsf
