College Takes Limited Swing Toward Mobi lizaiiiiil,

By Andy Biliiassley

Uncertainty gripped the cam~
pus as college doors opened
in Scptember and men began to
stumble in with one eye still
on their dratt boards back
home. The “police action" and
the calling ot reservists looked
like a crisis, but the year fin-
ishod» with tew men being
called.

The next significant develop»
merit in the minds Of drattable
men came near the close of the
semester when President Same
uel Stevens announcd the com—
pulsory accelerated physical
training program.

Thereaction hi this announcer
mcnt was spontaneous and
vociferous. The men‘s reasons
ran the gamut of reasoning. One
fellow thought sucii training
had no place in a liberal arts
collegc Another thought it
would make military-minded
men out of peacerloving stua
dents unnecessarily. The most
common obJeCLlon was that it
toolr too much tinic and held
so little value for the student
in return.

On the other side oi the tones
were

program A number of them
thought lL was one of the truly

men who‘ supported the‘

h‘carts, and would enable Grin-
ncll men to surpass dthers in
case of military service

After the semester of the pro»
gram no men have ciicd trorn
iover-exertion and no men have
developed into giants. The re
action of the men to the pro-
gram now seems to dorm a,
norm somewhere between the
two extremes notcd earlier.

A spell oi optimisim began to
permeate the campus. The Press
