Double-breasted for
young men '

OME men look much better than
others in the .double - breasted
models. The idea in double»
breasteds nowadays is to make them
to give a more slender looking ﬁgure
than the old—fashioned, solid, stocky

type we used to think of when we
thought of double-breasteds.

HART SCHAFFNER & MARX

have produced for us some very smart
new styles in these models. If you
like the double—breasted type, we‘ll
make you look well in it.
