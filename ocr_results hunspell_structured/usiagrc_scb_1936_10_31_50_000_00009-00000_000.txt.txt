'Captain Stevens Prefers
to Address College Audiennces

“I would rather speak to a
group of college students than to
any other audience," declared
Capt. A, W. Stevens, commander
of the 1935 stratosphere expedi-
tion, in a brief interview Thurs-
day evening. “I like the recep-
tion I get at colleges, being met
at the train, and having other at-
tentions given to me. The next
best bet is a society of engineers;
aside from that, I don't care very
much for lecturing."

Captain Stevens appeared in the
hotel lobby, dressed for dinner at
the faculty club, wearing his
army ofticer's uniform, and smok-
ing a cigar.

Plays Tennis

“A few minutes after I ar-
rived in Crinnell this afternoon, I
expressed a wish to play tennis,
and Mr. seiver obligingly offered
to play with me. The score came
out about even," he confessed mod—
estly.

“The National Geographic socin
ety was pretty well satisfied with
the last flight we made," Captain
Stevens said in answer to a ques-
tion of whether or not he intended
to continue his stratosphere flying.
“But 1 think I could better my
record by at least 2,000 feet by
using hydrogen in the balloon in-

stead of helium, and I hope to

have a chance to try again."
He also explained that they could

prevent a recurrence of the bal-
loon’s ripping while in the air by
filling it only with gas, instead of
combined air and gas. “It was a
good thing that the balloon was
descending when that happened,”
he laughed. "Of course there was
nothing to do but jump with the’
parachute." 1

Captain Stevens and, Captain l,
Anderson started lecturing imme-i
diately after their flight in 1935,;
first speaking to a group of 5,000 ,
in Washington, D. C., and then
traveling to Florida on a lecture,
tour.

"Lecturing with moving pictures
has its disadvantages," he stated.
“I’m having trouble now with the
lamps for my machine, The first,
one was broken when my grip was
dropped on the floor, the second;
was burned out, and if anything

happens to the third and last onc‘

 

tonight, it will be just too bad,
After this," he laughingly connz

eluded, as a faculty member ap~

peared to inform him that it was
time for dinner. “I’m going to can
i-y a supply of six to be sure that
1 don‘t run out."
