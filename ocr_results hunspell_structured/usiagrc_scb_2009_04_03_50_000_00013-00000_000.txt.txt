Track and field teams head to South Carolina over break

By Max CALENBERG

With an inﬂux of students, strong returning athletes, and
an encoumging indoor season, the men's and women's track and
ﬁeld teams are aiming to have a standout season.

The teams Lravcled to Myrrle Beach, s.c., over spring break
to practice and Compete in the Shamrock Invitational hosted by
coastal Carolina University.

“Vi/e often did more than one workout a day," said women's
head coach Evelyn Freeman. “It was nice to not be limited by
time. There was a lot more opportunity to work on technical
events." .

After a week of practices, athletes competed in the anlle
tional against top competition including St. Norbert College,
UNC Wilmington, University ofSotlth Carolina, and 2008 Di-
vision 11 champion St. Augustine College.

on the men's side, team Captain Nick sparr ’09 ran away

with the 3000 meter race,
winning in a time of 8
minutes 47.44 seconds,
while setting a school re-
cord for the event.

"It felt good," said
Span. "Especially to heat
some Division 1 guys."

Willie Stewart ’09
placed third in rhejavelin throw, throwing an impressive 191'11",
an NCAA Division III Nationals provisional mark, the temper
taiy mark to qualify for nationals.

“I was pleased with my throwrng," Stewart said. “It was a
vast improvement upon my opening meet last year, hopefully it
speaks of good things to come.

For the womens team, Becky Bessinget 09 claimed ﬁfth in
the women's 3,000-meter steeplechase, with a time of11:53.85.

"It's been two years since she’s run that race," Freeman said.
“So it was nice to see her get a good race under her belt.”

One disadvantage plaguing Grinnell in the past has been low
team numbers in certain events, particularly shorter distances.
However, this season Coach Freeman has seen that trend re
verse. _

“In the past distance runners have been at least halfthe team,"
Freeman said. This year we have a lot ornew sprinter jumper
types so that really helps with balancing our team.

Although the team did not Etta too well at the Midwest
Conference Indoor Championships, with the men taking ﬁfth
place and women eightrplaee, Coach Freeman erres injuries and
missing athletes for the results.

“Had we been at full strength we have no doubt that we
would’ve ﬁnished second," Freeman said. “With the women,
we had quite a few health issues and some key athletes studying
abroad.”

”ll fell good Espetiai/y to bear
some Division i guys.”
