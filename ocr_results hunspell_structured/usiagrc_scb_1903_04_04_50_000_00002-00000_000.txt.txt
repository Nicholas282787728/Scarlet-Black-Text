three athletic teams crippled on
account of men being behind in
their studies. It is not a pleasant
condition to think about, it is not
a pleasant condition to be in, but
the cold [acts are existent to be
faced nevertheless Most of these
cases are practically beyond help
for this year, but they ought to
serve as a striking warning to any
men who cxpcct to try for athletr
ic tcams. Grinnell does not want
men to represent her who are not
able and willingto do bona hde
college work, tor the entering oi
such men in athletic contests is
the ﬁrst step toward professional-
ism, but she does want every man
who has athletic ability to keep
up his studies and represent her
well both in class room and athlet»
ic events. These things ought
not happen, They are, In nine
cases our of ten. without any tear
sonable excuse. and every man
who is now training for athletic
events should remember that the
college is not for athletics but for
educational development, and
that success in athletics is not real
success unless it goes hand in
hand with success in the class
room.
