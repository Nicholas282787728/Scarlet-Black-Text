KDIC Retdming With
“Above Ground” Sound

by Ken Scutton

Renovations are almost com-
plete at KDIC. the campus radio
station. and the station should
start broadcasting again at a new
level or lou watts in less than two
weeks, when 1(ch returns to the
am however, not only will the
equipment and the station have
been renovated, but so will the
programming.

According to station manager,
David De Young, KDIC will have
to make a change in its air quali-
ty. “Although the ‘unllerground
sound' that KDIC had in the past.

think the higher wattage will pro

To achieve better air quality.
the station may begin operating
with a restricted schedule rather
than attempt as in the past to be
on the air 24 hours a day “We
want to promote quality not (plan

Interviews will also be condutec
with disc jockeys. "We want to

impress upon djs that Kim has to.

more responsible. We don't want

the station to lose its alternative.

be more carelul In order to avoid
breaking gulations and (“tells
ding listeners " he said, ’

The inCl‘ use of KDlC‘s power
brings with it new responsibilities
in terms oi complying with FCC
regulations. For example, KDIC.
as a 100 watt station. will have to
itleiitiiy 5 to 10 needs of its broad
cast community and then give
evidence or some program that is
addressing these needs,

The FCC will now be making in-
spection checks periodically, and
according to Doug Vernier, the
station manager of KUNl and the
new proressional consultant lor
KDIC. the station should expecl
its ﬁrst check sometime in the
next year.

In order to do a show on KDICl
disc-jockeys will now have to be
licensed by the FCC. l‘hls entails,
however. applying for a
Restricted hodic-i'clcphone
Operator's Permit. ior which
there is no fee The only skill nearl-
ed for the permit is llueiicy in
English. The permit is Valid as

soon as it is applied for.

There has been some specula~
tion as to whether or not the col
lege administration would excl»
else more control over what goes
out mer the air at KDlC. College
president George Drake. admits
that "we have to take more in-
terest in KDIC both legally and
irom a public relations stand
point." But, he said he still sup-
ports leaving the operation or the
station primarily up to the
students.

decision to an Iowa District Court

“1 just want to cooperate." Noel
told judge Michaels. ”1 don‘t want
to cause any more trouble than i
already have.”

Police ofﬁcer McCoy's final
comment was. “A lot or quick ac-
tion by a lot at people helped avert
a potentially bad situation."

“Grinnell has the same hard,
serious crimes as other cities but

not as often.” he said.

major crime incident in Grinnell.
in 1979 a bank robbery occurred in
which two hostages were taken
and both were killed.
