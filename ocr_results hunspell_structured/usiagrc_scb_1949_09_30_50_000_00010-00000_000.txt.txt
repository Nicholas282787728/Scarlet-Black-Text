There’s no ﬁner cigarette in the world today than Lucky
Strike! To bring you this ﬁner cigarette, the makers of
Lucky Strike go after ﬁne, light, naturally mild tobacco
—¢md pay millions of dollars more than ofﬁcial
parity prices to get it! So buy a carton of Luckies
today.gSee for yourself how much ﬁner and smoother
Luckies really are—how much more real deep-down
smoking enjoyment they give you. Yes, smoke :1 Lucky!

It’s a ﬁner, milder, more enjoyable cigarette!

DAN CURRIN, independent warehouse opern~
tar of Oxford, N. 0., has smoked Luckies for
20 years. He says: “To me, Luckies taste better.
I've seen the makers of Luckies buy ﬁne,
prime tobaccu, you know!” Here’s more
evidence that Luckies are a ﬁner cigarette!
