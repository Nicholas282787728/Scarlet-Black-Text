Thetype gremlins were hard at work
atthe HeraldchgisteroverLaborDay
weekend—or that’s who we like to
blame when mistakes show up in the
newspaper after (never before!) it’s
printed.

Exactly why they chose Labor Day
weekendto showtheirnastylittle faces
is not clear. Maybe because it was the
end ofa long hot weekandthey wanted
to prove who’s in charge.

Or maybe they were getting even
withthefolkswhostayedaroundto put
the paper together for early Tuesday
morning printing rather than giving
them the run ofthe place to play their
games.

There’s no accounting for what they
do except that their handiwork shows
upto embarrass the staffafterthe paper
is distributed.

This is not the ﬁrst nor the last time
they will play their tricks, so we’ll

proving the second reading ofan ordi»
nance establishing a system that will
allow people to reserve city park sliel»
ter houses for such things as family
reunions, birthdays and various rccrc-
ational events.

Until now, shelter use has been on a
ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis. The new
system will allow people to call the
Recreation Department to rentthe shel-
ters. A sign Will be posted at the shel-
ter, advising people when a reserva-
tion has been made.

In other action, the council:

- Approved a request by J.R. and
Linda Paulson that parking be allowed
on the west side of East St. in front of

theirbed-and-breakfast inn, the Marsh
House, However, parking restrictions
are likely to be imposed again when
the Iowa Interstate Railroad begins
work on its West St, crossing and traf-
ﬁc is detoured onto East St.

~ Gave the go-ahead for the Iowa
Department of Transportation to study
and approve a request by Grinnell vetr
erinarian KC. Cornish to build a new
veterinary clinic on the west side of
West St. between First and Second
avenues.

- Delayed action on a lease agree
ment between the city and Grinnell
Athletic Recreation Center, pending
resolution of some legal language re
lated to liability.

Shults said it was Sittig's idea to
apply for the federal grant,

“We‘ve been looking at ways that
might extend the programs we’re al»
ready working on,” Shults said. “One
idea we came up with was to begin

but by studying police and juvenile
