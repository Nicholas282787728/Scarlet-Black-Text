Superbowl 'comes down to QB

In a season that has seen 12 teams throw
for over 4,000 yards, it should be apparent
to everybody who watches that the NFL is
smack-dab in the middle ofa passing revolu-
tion. It seems only ﬁning that the two most
explosive offenses in the league will square
off in this year's title tilt. Both offenses are
loaded with highvoctane players like Regs
gie Bush, Reggie Wayne, jeremy Shockey
and former Hawkeye great Dallas Clark
Make no mistake, thoughithese ofe
fenses only ignite because of their
quarterbacks. Apologies to Brett
Favre, Phillip Rivers and Aaron
Rodgers, but Drew Brees of
New Orleans and Peyton Mane
ning of Indianapolis are clearly
the two best quarterbacks in the
business.

So let’s break ‘em down. I’ll
start with “DreWrOrleans, La—
Brees-iana,"as some have hailed
him. On an emotional level, the
guy has a chunk of state of Loue
isiana ready to believe that
they’ve completely round-
ed the Katrina corner. He

passing. Brees was third in the league with an
average of8.5 yards per completion and see-
ond in the league with 292.5 passing yards
per game during the regular season. Most
importantly, he was first in the leaguewith
34 TD passes, while only tossing 11 intercep»
tions. Brees has been putting up these kinds
of gaudy numbers ever since he strapped on a
ﬂeurrderlis helmet, but he did it in San Diego
on a less consistent basis before that. Upon
looking at his statistics over the last six sea-
sons, it‘s hard to believe that Brees has not
won a single MVP, but it’s not without rea
son.
This is largely because Colts Chiarterback
Peyton Manning has been playing at an as-
tronoinical level over that exact same period
of time. In fact, in an astounding coincidence,
Manning has won three ofhis four MVPs in
the last six years, and those three MVPs came
in Brees’ three best statistical seasons as a pro.
In two ofthese three seasons, Brees' numbers
were better than Peyton’s. Why has Peyton

been granted deity status by prergame hosts
over the last six seasons while Drew Brees has
yet to attain that same type of name recog,
nition and respect? The short answer is this:
Peyton Manning brings more than just his
stats to the game. Statistically, he’s not much
better than Drew Brees, but his eraetor is
rooted in-something much more concrete
than an ability to take advantage of the raw
emotion ofa region, as is the ease ofBrees.
It is rooted in Peyton’s destiny to win a
second championship and forever
put to bed the argument that he
is not the best quarterback of
his generation.

While his regular season
record may not seem like it,
Manning has had to over
come much adversity in his
career. Heartbreaking playoff
losses, the loss otseveral all-pro
skill players around him, and in-
juries have all conspired to taint
the Peyton Manning story with
tragedy and disappointment.
Peyton just didn't let it hap-
pen. After strong seasons
ending with painful playoff
losses to the lets, the Far
ots (twice) and the Steelers
2—2005, the Colts ﬁnally won
a 2006, with Manning taking
nors. Manning and the Colts
won thar year without thime All~Pro run-
ning back Edgerrin James, deemed one of
those “integral" players of the Colts' offense,
who was traded to Arizona before the season,
In fact over the years, Peyton‘won without a
number of players previously thought to be
invaluable to the ColtsY offensive scheme. Afr

Left Tackle Tarik Glenn retired. A man
Manning once called “the best slot receiver in
NFL history," Brandon Stokley left the team
in 2007. This offseason, the Colts waived
future Hall-of»Famcr Marvin Harrison. In
the first game of the season, the Colts lost
Stokley's successor, Anthony Gonzalez, to a
seasonrending knee injury None of it rnatr
lcrsiMannlng routinely makes mld-to-late
round draft talent into superstars. Point-in—
case, Austin Collie (fourth round) and Pierre
Garcon (sixth round), the two receivers who
have played in the slot since Gonzalez was'
injured, combined 1,454 yards receiving and

11 TDs this year.

The dude is basically an offensive coor-
dinator with all the physical tools needed to
play quarterback in this 1eague.The proof of
Peyton's prowess is in the pudding, as they
say. Just look at the Colts’ offensive scheme.
The team essentially runs :1 constant hurry-
up offense, occasionally skipping the huddle
altogether, and Manning makes multiple au-
dibles at the line of scrimmage based on the
defensive formation. How are you supposed
to stop the man when he knows what you’re
going to do, and is going to change the play
to exploit your weak spots? I know Saints
fans are talking about their big, bad pass rush
right now, and how the book on Manning has
always been to apply pressure and shoot the
gaps. However, they are underestimating the
characteristic that transformed Peyton Man-
ning from a talented quarterback to the best
player in the leagukhis experience. Mane
ning has now played 12 seasons in the NFL
and the playoffs in 10 of those seasons. He
has seen everything, and- he has grown out
of that small phase of his career where the
pressure rattled him. Nobody can pick up the
blitz as effectively as Peyton Manning and
nobody can get the ball out faster as proven
this season. Keep in mind, the Colts had the
worst rushing attack in the league this year—

'Peyton has been playing against teams that

know he‘s going to pass and pass often. Peyr
ton still threw for 4,500 yards, and the Colts
still went 1472.

The reason I haven’t mentioned defense
is because neither ofthese defenses are going
to be able to shut down the opposing team’s
offense. Like 1 said, this is a passing revolur
tion and the offense holds all the cards. In
addition, it appears star defensive end for the
colts, Dwight Freeney, will not play because
of an ankle injury While a key defensive stop
or a forced turnover could very Well be the tier
ﬁning moment of super Bowl XLIV, I think
this game boils down to which team can score
30 points first and that means it boils down
to Manning vs. Bre‘es. The saints are a tal—
ented team and had a charmed season, but as
much as people want to see them win, might
beats right. Peyton Manning is just slightly
betler than Drew Brees and the Colts arejust
slightly better than the Saints.

The Gtinnell Men’s Basketball Team won
against non-conference foe Fontbonne Uni-
versity, 121-98, last Sunday at Darby Gymna-
sium, tying their highest mark for most points
in a single game this season—the team scored
121 points in a nonreonference victory over Au-
rora University back on Nov. 27.1t ms ju_st the
sixth game the team has scored over 100 points
this season. With this win, the team moves to
an overall record of 5—12 but remains 3-7 in the
Midwest Conference.

“I thought we were more aggressive oEen»
sively than we have been at other points this
year,"wrote Head Coach David Arsenault in an
e-mail

Forward Matt Skelly‘12 attributes their sun:
cess and aggressiveness to a total game eEol-c on
both offense and defense.

"We were able to get them to turn the ball
over which led to a faster pace of play and more
opportunities for us onensively" Skelly said.

Dylan Seelma'n ’13 lead the team with 29
points, and Skellywas close behind him with 28.
Matt Chalupa ’12 contributed 12 points, while
Dominique Bellamy '13 scored 11 and Soott

it's been nearly two decades since the Grinnell’
Women's Basketball team finished at the top of If
their conference,

Indeed, many of the players on Grinnell's
young team hadn’t even been born when the A
1990-91 squad took the Midwest Conference \
title. Yet even while heading into the end of ‘ ‘ '
a tough 2009—10 season that has netted only ll
four wins to date and countless heartbreaking «a!
\_/

losses, the Pioneers feel as though their luck
' may be about to change.

“We expect a lot of ourselves,” said Jessica
Shotts ’10, the team’s only senior and one ofthree
captains. “It’s not that we can’t be #1 in the confer—
ence because we definitely could have been this year if
we played every game the way we knew how to play. A lot
oftimes we just beat ourselves."

Those affiliated with the program tend to point to the
team’s youth when explaining their difficulty with main-
taining leads or pulling out wins in close contests.

"Our team is very bottom-heavy in terms of having a
lot of first years and sophomores contributing a lot of time,"
Head Coach Kate Gluckman said. “I think there's a level of
patience that is very difﬁcult but necessary right now in terms
orwhat we're trying to be, and what team we’re going to be‘ in
the next one or two years."

Gluckman and her squads patience has begun to pay off
for the Pioneers, who have become a more tightrknit team going

“Now at the end ofthe season everybody's really‘srarting to listen
to each other more, which 1 think is going to be beneficial for us
next year,” said jessica vaverka '11, co-caprain and center. "We're
all going to just be able to go in knowing that we all have some-
thing to add to the team.” _
The team's progress has only produced one win since com-
ing back from Winter Break, an 8*p0int victory over an~
rence. After giving up tough losses to Monmouth and, Lake
Forest last week, Grinnell will travel to Wisconsin to face
Ripon and Beloit, making this their second week, in a row
widwut any home games.
Winning this weekend would- give the Pioneer women a
chance to highlight the progress they have made.
“Ifwe start these next six games on a roll, I think we dtﬁ’
nitely have a chance to win out," said Meg Huey '12, forward.
“We know that we progressed in skill but we want to progress
in a way that’s visible to people outside ofour program."
Although Grinnell Women’s Basketball believes they are
headed towards a bright future, the focus right now is on
this weekend, as it provides the first steps towards next
year’s success.
“I think that some of our upcoming games are
games we’re going to be in, especially this weekend,"
said Ashley leannin '12, Carcaptain and guard. “I
think those are definitely going to be opportuni-
ties for us to set the tone for the end of this year
going into next year."

sive play this weekend as they face Ripon Col-
lege on Friday and Beloit College on Saturday,
both away garnes.Two months ago, the Pioneers
lost to both schools at home, and are looking to
avenge those loses this weekend.

"We are definitely united to face Beloit this
next weekend because we feel we let on sli
away when we lost to them by one the first time,
said Kaitz, who is the point guard and one of the
to-ca rains for the team. - g

e Pioneers, 0~9 on 'the road, are also
looking for tha'r first win away ﬁorn home this
season, and are optimistic they will find it this
weekend.

"Ripon and Beloit will be tough tests this
weekend, but ifwe play up to our capabilities,
then there's no doubt we can win both," said
Grifﬁn Lentsch '13,.d-le leading scorer for the
team, and the first freshman to do so since John
Grotberg'09 accomplished the feat in the mice
season.

The young team also looks forward to testing
themselves amongst other conference teams—
teams that know the “system”—with their last
six games all against Midwest Conference foes.

“We haven’twon on the road all year so the
games this weekend will test our maturity. We
are eager for the opportunity to go up north and
prove we can win on the road,” Skelly said.

"System" basketball, a strategy that Coach
Arsenault has perfected and utilized over the
years, depends not only on the team’s ability
to shoot accurately but also to shoot and score
quickly to generate an insurmountable point
total. in the six seasons prior, the Pioneers did
not average less rhrn 108 points per game, and
typically led the nation in points scored per game
in any of the three NCAA divisions. This sea—
son, they are avnaging '92 points over a total of
17 games so far with just s'ot games left on their
regular season schedule.

"We have been a diﬂ’erent team than past
years and because of that we might not'average
over 100," l<ait—r said. “There have been games
where we have pulled back in order to save our
legs, and that has resulted in fewer points scored.
At times our offense has looked great. If we can
become more consistent offensively we will be-
gin to see the higher point totals we have seen in
past years." ’

So,will the Grinnell Men’s Basketball team
average over 100 points at the end of this semn?

Coach Arsenaulr says, “We would have to go
on a real tear to average 100 po' to game this

 

ye ljustdon't see that happenin
