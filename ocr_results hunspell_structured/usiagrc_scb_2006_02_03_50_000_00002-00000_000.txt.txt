Student math prize posthumously named for 11th
President of Grinnell College, Pamela Ferguson '

Most students here have no cxpce
rience of Pamela Anderson Ferguson,
a long-time professor and one-time
president ofGrinnell College, But cur-
rent and future students will remember
Ferguson’s legacy through a l‘nalhcmal’
ics scholarship announced by her hus-
band last week.

“We feel that helping others to fole
low in her footsteps and appreciate the
intrinsic beauty of [matheinatcis] is the
best way to honor her memory," said
widower Roger Ferguson.

The spouse of Grinnell College’s
11th president Pamela Ferguson has
endowed the college with funding for a
monetary prize offered to mathematics
majors entering their senior year.

Candidates for the Pamela Fer-

guson Endowed Prize in Mathemat—
ies will be judged on the basis of their
performance in mathematics classes,
independent research projects, posters
and other presentations, publications
and competitions.The intention ofthe
prize is to recognize and encourage pee
rential within mathematics. Up to two
prizes will be given each year.

“Pam’s great love was mathemao
ics,“ Roger Ferguson told the college.
“She loved cxplOring its boundaries
and bringing new clarity to ideas never
before understood or explored."

While candidates ofboth sexes will
be considered, there is an emphasis on
female applicants, who are often under-
represented in the field.

Ferguson graduated from Wellesley

and University of Chicago. She came
to Grinnell college after serving as
an associate provost and dean of the
graduate school at Miami University.
Her tenure as president of the college
spannd Six years from 1991 to her res-
ignation in 1997.

“It was mathematics that led to her
great success in life," Roger Ferguson
said. “She had many other great abili-
ties ...but she never would have had
that opportunity if not for her math
ematical abilities.”

She continued to teach mathemat-
ice and computer science at the college
as long as her health permitted and
passed away in Des Moines, lowa, on
Apr. 24, 2004.

Gaunt said that she saved up her
vacation time until she felt she had
enough, seven and a half weekends, to
cross the line again at the SOA. After
getting a six-month sentence, she re—
quested a leave ofabsence from the col-
lege for the remainder of the sentence.

A Dec. 8 letter sent to Gaunt from
Kristin Lovig, director of human re-
sources, laid out how Gaunt's vacation

Many students feel debate a tie

their home in Mexico and crossed the border into the U.S.when she
was four, making her family undocumented immigrants.

An estimated 2007230 people attended the debate, A postedee
bate survey administered by the Student Campaign for Increased
Political Engagement revealed that while most Grinnellians attend-
ing the debate overwhelmingly agreed with Grey’s position. roughly
43 percent of students felt the debate had no clear winner.

Vasquez felt the debate was disappointing. “I thought Grey was
more of an entertainer than a debater,"she said.

She claimed that the Minute Men are trained to hide their true
actiVities from the media, not help immigiants.“[5imcox] said they
acniailygive [illegal immigrants] food and water,” she said, "I don’t
see how slashing water tanks is really helping them."

Simcox was calm as he presented himselfand his ideas as straights
forward common Sense, “I represent a group of citizens who had no
choice but to stand up for the defense of their community,” he said.
Vasquez rcburtcd that the neigborhood watches don’t combat rhc
source ofincreased crime rates, like drug cartels.

Gray reminded the audience that no American is unaffected by
illegal immigration. “We’re all part of this integrated economy that
takes full advantage ofthe presence ofillegal immigrants."

 

Ask the Presidénl

 

 

 

Word on the street is you attended law
school with new Supreme Court Justice
Alito. Can you give Grinnellians any
insight into the newest Supreme Court
Justice?

I attended law school with Clarence Thomas, Bill and Hillary
Clinton and Sam Alito.l saw the least of [Alito] and don't remem—
her much. He was (and is) serious. He was proud ofhis heritage. He
did well.
