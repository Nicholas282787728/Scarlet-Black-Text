The importance of Gl'illllell‘s precarious athletic
Situation has nalibeen over-stressed by the SCARLET
AND BLACK. A conservative analysis indicates that a
judicious and prompt settlement of the problem is absoV
llltcly Vital to the future of‘tlle college. Briefly and
fran ‘the SCARLET AND BLACK is unwilling to
endulse the present athletic policy Theoretically, the
policy is most desirable and idealistic; practically, it is
almost a, "flap”, to speak in pouplar terminology.

The present policy regards athletics as an integral
part of the educational program; CoaChes are not Secured
primarily to win champiunships, but to ﬁt into
the academic system; coaches are paid an the same
considerations that govern salaries of the teaching staff.
Truly, if the same principles governed the policies of
the schools which compete with Grinnell, the situation

Tile inovnnble result of a breakdown in Gl'innell’s

experience. We must not [ilrnish rope for our uwn

this time to it cause which promises no immediate bless-

Tl problem of over-emphasis of athletics has been

/ our present task is to strengthen, not weaken, our

effect cannot be accomplished without ﬁnancial sacriﬁce. '

Tulips do change! Several months ago it was
pllblic' v for chapel; now it's publ' ' y in chapel.
with the devoting of chapel po ads to the advertis—

ing at plays, a new channel ol publicity has been opened I

to prospective press agents and advertising specialists.
Perhaps the near future will ﬁnd a utilization of the
tiicllty-lninute lleriod for such practical purposes as
aluminum demonstrations. box suclals and pot luck
breakfasts. The ﬁeld has unlimited possibilities!

Senatorial courtesy trailed in the dust one morning
this week \ﬂlen three faculty members instituted a new
phase of chapel courtesy. that of “walking out" on the
speaker during the morning talk.

Supposing the students should take the same attitude
and leave as they feel wont to do so—possibly the conse-
qllence would frequently be rather unsatisfactory.

Dear Sir: ,
Many people are of the opinion that
an athletic coach serves for no other
purpos’c than to build a physical nizl~
chine of fighting men. True he does
this, if he has the ability, but he does
much more than, just this. More than
anything else he is influential in shap—
ing the attitudes and principles that
the man carries into the business and
professional world. The personal con-
tact that he has with the men permit
this as no other one thing can do.
The things, aside from physical
skill, learned in athletics by the con-
stant association of men, are the
things that stick with a person long
after everything- else is forgotten. The
coach teaches ’these other things, too.

Editor DI the Scarlet and Black:

Although the fact that freshmen
leave chapel before the juniors and
seniors has been discussed at great
length, and numerous (ﬁher hare
angues or greater literary worth than
this have been written upon the sub
ject, I believe it is still not out of
place to call it once more to the at-
tention of the offending undel‘grzldlk
ates.

That seniors shall be accorded the
privilege of leaving‘thc chapel first,

 

juniors second, sophomores third, and
freshmen fourth has long been a tr..-
