STUDENT FELEOWSHIP I“

A big, worthiwhile proposition was
put up to the Grinnell students and
faculty last week when Miss Margaret
s. ouayle spokevon the conditions ob-
taining among the university students
in Russia. According to Miss Quayle
the students there are going to school
under the most severe and trying con~
ditions in order‘

ers, doctors, nurses, and prolessional
people, '

THE DRAKE GAME

Plans are now being made.wbich
make it possible to have the Drake-
Gl'innell loot ball game here in Crin-
nell next year. So tar there is no
other Valley game on the home
schedule, although nothing definite‘
has been decided as yet. The Dl'hke
game is recognized by both schools
as the most important and bitterly
lought contest on their schedules. and
Grinnell would rather beat Drake
than any other team that they play.
It is the old traditional contest be—
tween ths two rival schools.

The Scarlet and Black believes that l
the bringing oi the Drake game to‘
Crinnell would be a very good thing.
It would be advantageous to the stu-
dents, a good thing tor the school as
a whole, and a mighty tine thing for
a successtulHomeconiIng. !

No matter how strong an effort. is:
made to get the crowd cut for a'
"Migration Day" to Des Moines, no
one especially the Des Moincs people,
should be blind to the fact that it is
impo. ible (0 get even it third of the]
student body down to Des Moiues.l
There is a very good reason tor this,

A Homecoming is a splendid thing tor
a school because it brings the alumni
back in touch with the school and
promotes a general good feeling all
around.

The only objection to the plan from

faculty want the game here, and their

would rather play on its home neldI

body wants the game here except a
low of the alumni, and it would seem
that they ought to be willing to come
