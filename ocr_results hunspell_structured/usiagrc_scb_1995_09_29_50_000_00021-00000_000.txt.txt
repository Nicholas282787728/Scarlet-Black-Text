lies," she said.

Some of the specific mediation strat-
egies the institute employs. according
to a handout, include, “effective com-
munication, active listening, problem-
solving negotiation, and third party in-
tervention."

Dahl first became interested in con-
ﬂict resolution as a Grinnell student.
“Three classes helped spark the inter-

“The important point for a me- , ~

diator to remember is that we

cannot provide a solution. The .

disputants are the ones who
must forge a mutually-satisfac-

tory solution. It’s difficult to _
suppress that tendency to try ‘

to ‘fix’ people’s lives, but ulti-
mately, it is essential. Done

properly, conflict resolution , i

can preserve friendships, rela-
tionships, and families.”

est: Howard Burkle's ‘Modern Religious
Thought,’ a class taught by Kesho Scott-
any class of hers would make a person
think- and Wayne Moyer’s ‘Internation-
al Relations’ class. I used to be scared of
open conflict, and tried to avoid it when-
ever possible. These classes taught me
that conflict is a part of life, and that,
when dealt with properly, it can pro-
vide incentive for change, creating op-
portunities for collaborative problem
solving."

International Issues

:confliet resolution and mediation

e so effective, why do we still

, ve atrocities such as Bosnia?

‘ Why couldn’t mediators have
solved it long ago?

“I am no expert on Bosnia, but a few
conunents I could make off the top of my
head are that: I) the opposing sides still
believe that there are beneﬁts to fight-
ing; 2) the major powers are not in
agreement and therefore cannot exert
much in the way ofleverage; 3) timing is
an important factor in terms of solving
conflict,” said Dahl.

Even though some conflicts are un-
solvable, the IPI has helped train people
to work with other international is-
sues.

“I want to hasten to add that there
are many situations in which mediation
and new styles of negotiation have
worked successfully, and there are

bound to be more in the future," remarked
Dahl. “A few weeks ago, the Peace Insti-
tute met with a provincial official in the
South African government who wanted
to learn mediation skills for the formida-
ble task of redistributing land from the
white settlers to the blacks. Under apart-
heid, blacks were not allowed to own
land, and so, understandably, they have
been clamoring for justice and the govern-
ment has promised to help them. The
white settlers are—and again, I think if
you think about the situation from their
perspective, this feeling is understand-
able—reluctant to give away any land.
Clearly the situation is difficult and there
are fears of violence. Given the scale of
the land redistribution effort, this young
man was exploring the possibility oftrain-
ing provincial officials in conflict resolu-
tion techniques so that they could medi-
ate such disputes. This kind of work is
very exciting to me."

Grinnell Interns

‘HE Iowa Peace Insti-
tute offers a variety
of volunteer and in
ternship opportuni-
ties for members of the Grin-
nell College community. The
interns at the IF! this semes-
ter are sophomores Vylar
Barkauskas, Monique McK-
night, Sara Meinhard, Julie
Mickens, and first-year Anna
Tekippe. The interns work
anywhere from three to eight
hours per week.

The interns do diverse
work, which includes send-
ing bulk mailings, writing
thank-you letters, typing
things, printing labels, and
editing Peace Institute publi-
cations.

“The people in charge of
the interns are wonderful about giving us
tasks that we enjoy," said Meinhard. “They
are concerned that we don’t always get
stuck doing little stuff."

The interns whom I contacted were
very interested in the process of conflict
resolution. Tekippe,who hasbeeninvolved
withconflictinanagementm'ncehighschool.
l-Ier interest in conflict resolution stems
from her belief that, “Conflict resolution
promotes peace and understanding on a
ground level and that it is an essential skill
for everyday life.” She states that after
Grinnell she is interestedin pursuing con-
flict resolution in graduate school, and as a
possible career plan.

The interns feel good about the work
they are doing because the Peace Institute
has such a positive inﬂuence on people’s
lives. The Peace Insu‘tute brings conflict
managementtechniquestoschoolsthrough-
out Iowa. According to Tekippe, the Peace

Feature ' 9

Instituteis a valuable resource to Iowa 5
because, “These programs are very ef
fective in that they teach people life
long problem solving skills."

“In general, I love working at the
Peace Institute. I always walk out of ‘
their house feeling good about myself
and the time I just spent at the Iowa;
Peace Institute," said Meinhal'd. ‘

National TV Debut Monday 4

Peace l
is scheduled to ,
featured in a na-
onally televised documents
ry on PBS this week. The documenta
ry, entitled ‘The Ameg‘can Egocess,
will be aired on PBS this Monday
through Wednesday. The part featur
ing the Iowa Peace Institute and Grin
nell Middle School will be aired on
Monday, October 1nd at Bzoo p.m.
According to the Resolution Rec
port, [be American Process wil
look at evolution, problems, and
new promises of democracy in
America today. The Peace In
stitute was chosen to be in;
the documentary because' I t
was listed' in Frances Lap- 2
pé’s book. mm
mm, as a re-
source in democratic
living.
The part of th
documentary filmed in
Grinnell features a 5
sixth-grade extended .
learning class at Grin-
nell Middle school per .
forming an exercise i
called “Peanut Butter
and Jelly." For the ex- s
ercise, students are”
paired up and told to 3
makepeanutbutterand:
jelly sandwiches. The 1
pairs consist of one student who is >
blindfolded and isn’t allowed to speak
and another student who gives instruc« .
tions such as where the ingredients ‘
are and what to do. The exercise is
designed to teach students to use com- :
munication, empathy and listening '
skills in problem solving situations
Conflict resolution is a good idea to
Dahl because it is so applicable to peo- .
ple’s lives, she says. “In terms of inter- <
personal conﬂict, the hope is that medi-
ation will teach people how to commu-
nicate more effectively so that they an ‘
negotiate and make good decisions on
their own in the future. Theoretically,
this could mean thatwe’dbe outofajob :
eventually, but as we have all said to i
one another, we can’t see that possibil
ity coming true anytime soon! If any
thing, there is a greater need than ever .*
for these services and skills."
