Stanford Axed for It
With Armored Cars

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Calif,
(CNslistanford university's famous
axe, now securely locked in a bank
vault after being recovered from the
University of California two years
ago, will become a permanent trophy
for the winner of the annual "big
game” between the two schools.

Such was the announcement mode
this week by Stanford student offi-
cers, who said the first award of the
trophy would be made in 1933.

The Stanford axe tradition goes
back to 1399, when it became the sym—
bol of heated rivalry between Stanford
and “Cal.” It was stolen, however, a
few days after the yearly football ms»
sle, and was closely guarded by Cali—
fornia students for 31 yearsiuntil
April 4, 1930, when a special Stanford
expedition overcame an armed car es-
cort with the aid of a tear gas bomb
