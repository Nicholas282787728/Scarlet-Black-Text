I: We call It Multiform That‘s a

we'll have a different themc, llkc

our theme, we like to play artists
from many different gont'cs.

Ez‘Ycah, we play ti lot of Lou

J? I thought I ﬁlled that role in the

Jr’I‘m lucky you have opposable
thumbs, too, otherwise I'd be in a lot
oftrouble,

Er The moments of silence are
good, though, you know. Since it's
Friday afternoon and people are
geting ready to get trashed and the
moments of silence give them a
chance to stop and think, ‘Hey, do I
really want to gel trashed? Is this

Peering into Wirtzfield’s

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Anyone who has ever left his or
her room here at Grinncll has unr
doubtcdly seen a piece of Adam
Wtrtzfeld‘s art. It is Visible anywhere
from the front doors of Norris to
Bob's Underground. Wirtzfeld‘s art
includes posters, advertisements, and
comics More than a hundred of
Wirtzfcld's art pieces are presently
being displayed in the Terrace Art
Gallery, in the lower level ofthc For
rum The exhibition will run through
Friday, October ll. Among the
works being displayed are various
posters, comic strips, and envelopes
addressed to an elusive “Carol
Scholz."

By looking at Wirtzfeld‘s exhibir
lion, one can easily see his talent and
versatility. Wirtzfeld is capable of
drawing everything from pencil
sketches of scenery to completely
animated comic strips. Wirtdfeld ber
lievcs that is it important for a comic
strip artist to be able to draw many
different things and to be versatile.

Wirtzfeld liked drawing since he
was live. He continued to draw until
high school, when he concentrated
on academics and athletics and didn’t
draw at all, What Wirtzfeld Said was
key during those years was that he
began reading comic books. He soon
realized that comics were a “logical
extension” of his past in drawmg.

When he arrived at Grinnell,
Wirtzfeld met Zander Cannon, a see
ntor at the time. Cannon aided
Wirtzfeld in getting a start in
cartooning. Cannon now is working
in cartooning.

During his time here. wirtzfeld
has worked for the student publica-
tions The Gum, the Ill: and 0141:, and
the Seal lo! and Black. In addition, he
made posters for a radio show last
year, “The Cane Chronicles.” _

Wirtzfeld intends to go to an art
school, then hopefully to work on
creating his own cartoons. Wirtzfeld
has applied to the Joe Kubert School
of Cartoon and Graphic Art, a school
with the most prestigious cartooning
program in the nation, which only ac-
cepts eighty applicants a year.

Wirtzfeld hasn’t been turning out
very much work this year in compari-
son to years past because lic liasvbeen
preparing his portfolio. He remarked
that he was at a “tremendous dlSZlClr
vantage" when compared to other
applicants to Kuhert, many ofwhom

are studies or are applying straight
out of lush school. Ht: said that right
now he I. iying to “incrcasc quality
[and] decrease quantity. [To] create

Although he plans on becoming ti
comic strip "wt itcr/tii'tist.“ Wirtzlcld
is staying very realistic He noted that
his academics arc important not only
to better his comics, but also to "keep

Wtrtzfeld l'ccls that comics have
tin "untapped potential.” Although
they have traditionally been thought
of as for children, or as “books for
people who don’t understand the
written wold." Wirtzl’eld would like

Surprisingly. Wirtzt‘eld is not an
art mayor. Rather, he is a double mas
JOl’ in German and Philosophy. He res
cently found his study of German
useful when he traveled there to
study abroad. He found European ate
titudes towards all drastically differ
cnt than those in the United States.
He noted that there is much interest,
appreciation, and funding for art in
Europe. He found iliat “anywhere I
look[ed], there [was] something to
draw." Wirtzfeld feels that being

Wirtzfeld believes that there are

“two sides to art." He feels that,

people can “develop the skills," or
just have fun expres ng themselves.

realm, tackling more meaningful is
sues, Being a combination of both
words and pictures, he sees comics
as a “powerful means ofcommuni-
cation." He considers the vast major»
ity of comics today to be about “a
guy running around in tights." The
problem he ﬁnds there is that alr
though these comics constitute most
of the merchandise, they “only ap-
peal to a Speclﬁc audience."
Instead, Wirtzfeld seeks to create
“very good. interesting, and mean-
ingful stories." He does not want to
make “comics that sell, but comics
that appeal to me."
This practice of creating things
that express his beliefs is reﬂected
. in the types of people whom
Wirtzfeld admires. He respects “Viv
brant people who make their Exists
once known... who create things they
like that make them happy."
Wirtzfeld is excited by the pros

pect ofnew Ways to produce and dis-
play comics. He spoke of a comic
which was displayed on the Internet
Wllh moving segments. Innovations
like this one show promise for
cartooning, which recently has been
dOlng “the same thing. . . [and] ‘ean’t
be pushed much further." He is
greatly interested in things that “push
the limits, [and] challenge what we
consider communication,” He cites
the recent SGA movte The Pillow
Book as evidence of new ways of
thinking of art. He was intrigued by
the movie‘s new visual language
[using] different panels, bleeding
scenes on top of each other, words
written on the screen."

Wirtzfeld is dismayed by the in.
fluencc of the media these days,
though. He sees the media as using
visual arts to “evil ends," He finds it
disturbing that the media spreads
“conformist images" of a certain
mold that people should fit into. He
believes that this is “detrimental to
human happiness.”

WhatWinzfeld ﬁnds reassuring is
that comics, unlike television and
movies, are less susceptible to the
pressures ofmarketing and polls. The
artist. therefore, is virtually free to
do what he wishes. “Your imagina-
tion is the limit." he said. The artist
is able to “do anything," like work
mg all the Jobs up a ﬁlm. “[You are
the] actor, director, costume designer,
set designer..,"

Why does Wirtzfeld choose fol-
low such a difficult dream as
cartooning? “[I would] rather do
something that makes me happy,” he
said. He feels that cartooning is
“something that I can really be good
at," and that if people enjoy some-
thing that thcy’re good at, there’s a
good chance that they‘ll be success—
ful. Wirtzfeld admits that Lhough “the
stuff that I do is really good . it’s
different. I don‘t ever go for mass
appeal."

Inbidentally, Wirtzfeld said that
many visitors of his exhibition ask
about the envelopes addressed to
Carol Schulz, He explained that she
is a girl he dated in Minnesota, and
whom he wrote to from Grinnell.
What is most intriguing about these
envelopes is that Wirtzfeld illustrated
every one with a unique drawing af—
tcr he had written the letter. These. ,
envelopes are present everywhere in
his exhibition, even attached to a
Clear glass display case which holds

the second halfof another, less tacky

fans include Aimee Doll ‘98 and
Jamal Rogers ‘00, who must work
hard to slack to their frequent doses
of Marge, Homer. Bart, Llsa and
Maggie.

“Simpsonites are an interesting
bunch," said Rogers, trying to de~
scribe the typical viewer.. “They ap-
preciate comedy that walks Ihc fine

Homer is where the heart is

"Thc simpsons Crowd — we don't

the dialogue is going to make my

Bottuliful Thing is directed by
Home MacDonald and written by
Jonathan Harvey. The story is ccns
tcicd on the somewhat dysfunctional
home life of a boy, Jamie (Glen
Barry), whose mom Sandra (Linda
Henry) dreams of running her own
pub, and dates this really cool semi-
hippie guy (Ben Daniels). The neigh-
bors on one side are an elderly black
woman and her daughter Leah who
is for some reason obsessed with
Mtimti Cass. On lhc other side lives
a boy the age of Jamie, named Ste.
and his drug dealing brother and
drunk father.

This is a lovc story of a slightly
different nature, btit it’s still very

heartwarming. There's a reeling of

and Ste fall for each other and man

Rogers disagreed. “I like to watch
new episodes alone, to soak it all in."
he Said. “Then I watch with other
people, to observe their reactions."

Regardless ofthe means by which
viewers get their dose of Simpsons
fun, Doll and Rogers agreed that the
