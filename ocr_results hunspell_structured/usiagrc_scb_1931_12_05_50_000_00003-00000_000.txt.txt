Wins Comment

Read, Wood, Beatty Find
Magazine Creditable

of the College Poetry Society of
America, finds favor in the eyes of
several Grinnell faculty members
Paul Spencer Wood. professor all
English, Luella J. Read, dean of
women and Shelton L. Beatty, dean or‘
menpare among those commenting-l
upon its publication I

Mr. Wood reins s, "I think the,
fir-st number of the magazine is very:
creditable, much above the average}
undergraduate verse.” 1

“College Verse is rich in promise
as revealed in its first flowers," says‘
Mr. Beatty. “It is coherent and in—
telligible with satisfying beauty, and
doubtless will grow into a very valu~
able garden among college verses
makers, giving public light to the
work of budding poets, ;

“Its inclusion of everyday subjects
and its revelation of beauty in things
which we have not yet hallowed with
time or tradition were pleasing to‘
me. I feel great gladness that the,
Grinncll organizers of this venture
in college writing have succeeded so
well and have brought further di
tinction upon themselves and the col»E
iegc by so worthwhile a contribution‘
to American culture.”

“The first copy of the new maga-
zine of verse has demonstrated the
fact that college students today have
ability to do creative work in the“
field of poetry," Miss Read comments. l
"I am happy that the magazine has
had such an auspicious beginning”
Those who have made its publication"
possible can feel repaid for their ef-
forts and be encouraged to continue.",
