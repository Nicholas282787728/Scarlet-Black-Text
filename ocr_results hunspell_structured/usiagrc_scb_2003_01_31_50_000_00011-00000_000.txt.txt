The put year was a spcctncular one at the movies. There was rarely a
weekend when a dCCL‘nt movie couldn't be seen, anywhere in the Country,

That said, it was also a SPECLICulal’ year for critics with their conﬂatcd.

opinions, for comic book heroes leaping to the silver screen, for cpics
cclcbmting ciiiemuticspcetado, rind {or the indie ﬁlm set who found plcnry
or movies to adore simply because no one else can undcn'mnd rhcm.

What was incredible about this year was the variety, There were, or
course, the summer blockbusters and lame star vehiclcsifllms with a
speciﬁc audience of dollars in mindihul: there was also a mainstream
inﬂux oiindependent ﬁlm (led by My Brg Far and Waring) and cm.
ematic spectacles that, :vcn when they didn’t work (think The Lord Afrize
Ring}: The Turn ﬁrms), were a reminder ofall things great about the cm.
ema, which is, after all, about sitting in a dark room with your frleiidsr
eating popcorn, and cheering at the action onscreen.

Looking back on the year, I hesitate to construct the list that follows.
There were so many good movies and too many orthose I haven’t had the
chanc: to see (Fur me Hmvm, Pimp}: Drunk Lave, Aim: Schmidt, The
Pianist, Rnirirn-nofrmrr ore all on my list). But such is the plight of the
poor college ﬁlm critic. The list that follows, therefore, is not a “Best of”
list, in the familiar ranked criticzl format, but rather a list of my highest
recommended movies out ofall new ﬁlms I saw during the past ymt. In
no particular order: ,
Chicago

Tho ldnd orspettaele rhar rhe movies are all about, with nary a sword,
lighisaber, explosion. or magicwandl Cnimgg grabs the audience and n:ver
lets go. The songs, Richard cere, the sets—all brilliant. A couple orsccnes
were a hit annoying. 1nd the movie moved almost too East, but it still
nnks among the best movie musiuls I've seen.

Thirteen Conversations About One Thing

A ﬁlm about a group or peoplc scemmgly removed from each other
Wliosc lives interconnect in strange and interesting ways (sound laminar?)
But the reason this ﬁlm works, apart flum somc or the best acting orthe
year and a corch attention to detail, is that the film grows organically into
the complex structuro rathtr than being gimmicky.

The Dangerous Lives ofAItar Boys

Thcrc's something about being an ulnar boy and going to Catholic
school. There's something about eomie book heroes. And there's some-
thing about discovering girls that changes ovcryth'ng. Frcsh treatment,
emotional depth and sincerity, and great use of animation make this an
incredibly enthralling coming ofagu drama.

AboutA Boy

Another coming origo story. orsorts. This ﬁlm proves onto :gzln that

@2002

Pom-1m

crushed

Nick Hornby storro (sce Hig/r ride/try) make :xcellent ﬁlm material. The
pieces in Annual Boy fit together perfectly. It has the right amount of
humor and drama without being cloying or obnoxious, And with Hugh
Grant proddcd into his propcr place—(hat is, neither obitotiois nor cloy.
ing—he’s thoroughly enroyahlc.

Gangs of New York

The powcr orDaniel Day-Lewis rs uriderirahlc, but I wot equally im-
pressed with diroctor Martin Soorceso For undcrplaying Cameron Diaz
and Ieonurdo DiCaprio, The visual srylc, storytelling, and symbolism
carried the rest ofdio film. It was not scorcesc’s most polished or powerful
work, but his ambition, cinematic knowledge, and beliefln the power of
an image over snappy dialogue or star power make this the best foreign
film made by an Arnetimn since Stanley Kubrick

The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat)

IfI did hay: to pick a best ﬁlm of the year, this would probably be it.
Made in the Inuit language, the story is rm epic journey, the myth or
Atnnaryuat, that weavn the religion, customs, survival, and humanity of
the Inuit pooplc with dcceptively simple, surreal storytelling completely
void orpreiention. Weighing in at nearly three hours, the ﬁlm takes the
time to completely :ngng: the world or the story Nothing is lacking.

Igby Goes Down
I resist ailing this a coming or age role, because Igby is already grown

up, and he’s intriguing and brilliant and beautiful. just like the rest of this
ﬁlmi

Y Tu Mama’ También

A wild ride with a visceral, intimate, clam: style. Full afemtic tension
and explonuon, the real value afthis ﬁlm is the examination offriendship
and orout ability to know and understand other people. Directornlronso
Cuaron who a ﬁne line between artsy, intellegerit, and gratuitous; for the
most part, irresistible.

This movie seems to have boon oomplctcly forgotten, but Istand by it.
CQ is, above all perhaps, stylish, but always in logiral and appropriate
ways. At times it slips into pretentiousness, although that's probably par
{or a film dot is, manually, an examination orpretontiousnoss.

A daptation ,

The inclusion orAdoprnnon in this list is questionable. The ending of
tho film was 2 hugc lct down for me, and I'm not saying this bocausc I
didn’t undcrstarrd it but because I wanted ir to push the ooriecpt furdior.
once tho film sunk in a hit, 1 was willing to reeognrne that it is origin]
and daring enough to malts this list. It’s cxpcrimental, and where it squ
coeds it succeeds brilliantly.
