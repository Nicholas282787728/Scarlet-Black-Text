when she appears in the swamp with a
basket of hallucinagenic mushrooms.

Alter eating the mushrooms. the
characters drift into remembrance of
earlier stages oi their lives. According
to Moifett. Shepard's intent at this point
in the play was to have the characters
begin a retreat to a more primal ex-
istence until they have regressed into
animal forms

The cowboy. slim. is played by Ian
Roberts ('87) with Steve Atkinson (’86)
cast as Shadow. Jessica Thebus ('88)
plays Maria, the woman trapped in the
swamp. while Grisgris is portrayed by
Angel Annussek ('857.

An experimental role. the ghost oi
Maria’s daughter who later becomes
the beast. is played Aasia Arii (‘Esl and
Leslie Ragen l'Bst appears as a
preacher.

Steve Atkinson. who plays shadow.
said that when he first read the script
he thought it was really bizarre. “It's
another one at Sandy’s plays." he said.

Atkinson explained that he originally
had difficulty understanding Shepard's
intent with the play. but while prepar-
ing ior his part. Atkinson said he came
to see many parallels between the play
and society.

Atkinson added. ”lhis character is]
not good or bad. but a survivor. He is

young and inexperienced and searching .

what [he is searching tor] and that

llle course of the play. Atkinson's
character regresses into a Brahmai
bull,

Atkinson said one of the most difficult ‘
things about his part was learning to
make the sound of the bull.

Aasia Arif has one of the more ex-
perimental parts in the play as the
ghost of Maria's daughter, and later as .
the beast. Aril's character undergoes a
drastic change. When Arif first read the '
script. she didn't know how to play her
character. "l'm Sandy's experiment."
Aril said. Arii's role was gradually
developed through the course or the
rehearsals

Gasbarre’s Student Recital

by Kate Worster

Pianist John Gasbarre will hold his
student recital this Saturday at 2:00
pm. in Herrick Chapel. Gasbarre ( ’86).
a student or John Jensen. will play
works by Mozart. Chopin and Brahms.
He will end his program with variations
by Henri Herz on the Huntsmen's
Chorus from Carl Maria Von Weber's
Euryanthe.

Gasbarre chose the Mozart Sonata in
F Major. K1332 because of its clever
musical ideas and three disparate
movements. Gasbarre says that varia-
tions of a classical “Chopsticks” and
“Flight of the Bumblebee" can be
heard within the sonata.

The second piece Gasbarre will per-
form is Chopin's Polonaise in F minor.
The Polonaise requires much ﬁnger
power Gasbarre says. According to
Gasbarre, Chopin gives the fingers a
rest by placinE a Mazurka in the middle
of the piece so the pianist can recover

before the strain of the Polonaise’s en-
ding.

Gasbarre believes Brahms' Rha -
sody No. 1. 0p. 19 “contains one oft e
most beautiful melodies in Romantic
piano literature.” Brahms' Rhapsody
has a defiant mood complemented by
an episode of tender melancholy in D
minor according to Gasbarre. The mid-
dle portion of the piece is in B major
and is reminiscent oi a musette. says
Gasbarre.

The concluding number {or
Gasbarre's program is a set of varia-
tions by Henri Herz from Weber's
Euryanthe. Gasbarre spent two months
looking for variations by a “Lisztian”
composer oi the 19th century beiore
choosing the Her: variations.
Gasbarre's copy oi Herz's work was
made trom the only copy at the mo
manuscript which exiso.
