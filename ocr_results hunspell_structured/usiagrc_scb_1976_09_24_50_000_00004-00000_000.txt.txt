The three petitions below were written and circulated by a
group of thirty students, headed by senior Rick Peterson,
and presented to President Turner at the open forum
Wednesday night.

We, as members of the “Grinnell family,” the in»
tellectual community of Grinnell College, urge the ad-
ministration to re-examine its plans for reorganization.

We believe that college is important in the development
rof the self and of society. Events outside the classroom
vastly inﬂuence this growth. Extracurricular activities
such as popular and classical music concerts, theatre
productions, outdoor recreation and intramural sports
help to shape an individual more concretely than solely
intellectual pursuits. ,

We believe that the present high quality of such ac-
tivities will be compromised if the reorganization goes
into effect. Three full-time positions cannot be telescoped
into one, regardless of the capabilities of that one in-
dividual. As each person who would be affected by the
decision has expertise in his-her particular field that is
unequalled on this campus and perhaps in the United
States, the resultant loss of quality will be a loss not only
to present and future students, but ultimately to the
college itself.

We believe that Grinnell College will suffer temendously
if the reorganization goes into effect.

Signed by 536 students.

We, as members of the student body of Grinnell College,
are outraged at the Administration‘s plans for re-
organization and strongly urge a reexamination of such
proposals.

Each student at Grinnell is required to pay a 565 per
year activity fee to help pay for outdoor recreation. in-

on page 19 that "students currently participate in a
number of committees and have substantial voice in
matters that most directly affect them . . “here. then.

both of which are completely involved with student af-
fairs?

We hope that President Tumeris sincere in his equation
of the Grinnell community with a polls: "a community
where even one voice can be heard." However. our trust in
the Administration has been seriously weakened by the
firing of two individuals vital to student affairs. It is our

reorganization be re-eramined in the light of ad
ministrative errors in the dec sion~making process.

Signed by 510 students.

We. as members of the Grinnell College community,
urge the Administration to reexamine its plans for re-
organization.

We believe that although Grinnell College has a
commitment to “affirmative action" regarding the em-
ployment of women, it has disregarded this position in its
re-organizational scheme. The arbitrary and apparently
Unexamined firing of three qualified women leads us to
question the priorities of the Administration. If this is
truly to be a “joyful community" built upon trust among
students, faculty and administration, the reorganization
is a serious mistake with dire implications.

We encourage the Admi 'stration to reexamine its
policies with regard to the li ing and firing of all female
personnel and urge the adoption and the following of a
current ”affirmative action" plan for the college as a
whole. We further recommend that Grinnell College
review its decision to terminate the contracts of three
important women administrators.

Anthro majors protest
administrative reorganization

To the Editor: We in at-
tendance at the anthropology
majors meeting wish lo protest the
administrative reorganization will.
ch occurred “in our absence.” We
are extremely concerned with both
the nature oi the reorganization
and the eiiccts it has had, and will
have, on the campus “com-

mumly’ Three oi the
abolished positions were held by
women. One oi the new jobs was
immediately offered to a man. The
principle oi Open hiring, prescribed
by affirmative action, was ignored
Thus in one motion was taken a
giant step backward in the push for
equal representation of women in
responsible administrative
positions.

We’re not suggesting that
reorganization and economizing

when one considers the rationale
by which President Turner took it
upon himself to make the decision
in our absence. The basis of that

To the Editor'

Grinnell College has
:radilionally had an atmosphere of
intellectual conlemplaiion and of
cultural sensitivity which has
drawn attention from students and
faculty alike. l am concemed that
cultural activities such as con-
ceris. movies. and special events
will he of lesser quality and
number in the future because of the
Administration's reorganization.
Georgia Dentel has worked With
performers since 1960. Her exV
perlise and long-time connections
With entertainers and hookers are
known nationwide, such skills and
“leads‘Y are not easily developed
Because of her Iireless efforts,
Grinnell enjoys a reputation oi
being one oi the nallon’s top
schools from the performing ar-
usl's point at view.

Ms Dentel's firing is an example
of human error at the ad-
mlnistl‘alive level. President
Turner |S no ogre: he is a man
under pressure, forced lo make
numerous decisions daily, Like
everyone else, he makes mistakes
Let us as Students and as faculty

Phone theft

To the Editor Within the last
week someone cut the wires and
look the receiver irom an old
telephone circa 1385 that was on

in Karachi, Pakistan. someone
stole a small item irom my
unlocked car parked on the
campus. During the day my
colleagues and 1 announced in our
classes (hat the hem had been

By sundown the item was back
in the car.

rationale appears to be certain
speculation by the President on
what effect administrative
decisions will or will not have on
the quality of the liberal arts
education and lifestyle oi Grinnell
Students (if there is indeed a
distinction). We contend that there
will be great effects and that
therefore the process by which this
decision was made is encompassed
wilhin the scope of broad liberal
arts education.

It is unrealistic, given the
demands of the redefined position,
to think that anyone can “9'
establish the entertainment conr
[acts cultivated by Ms, Dentel over
the past sixteen years, Unrealistic
to think that GORP will not be
altered to its detriment without the
undivided and inspired attention of
a specialist as Ms, McCluskeyn
Iowa has recreational resources
that are less accessible and often
require more preparatory training
than may be the case in, say,

Vermont.

In the hopes of recliiying the
problems We are suggesting three
democratic approaches by which
the administration can assess
Student feelings: 1) an opinion
survey listing the options being
considered by the administration;
2) the formation of a joint coma
mittee to examine the options, 3)
administrative meetings with the
SGA

It is our feeling that the present
reorganizational
represents, metaphorically
speaking, a damper of in.
consistency and humiliation on the
liberal flame of the “White
Paper,” leaving only embers of
bitter cynicism in the minds of the

In response to the verbal attack made on the credibility of
the 58:3 (with'regard to last week's editorial) at Wed4
nesday's open forum, a brief clarification is warranted. The
statistics pertaining to the total number of administrators
versus the number of female administrators were indeed
obtained from the back of the current 1976-1977 College
catalog. .

The simple reason for the discrepancy between the S&B’s
figures and the percentages advanced by President Turner

lies in the definition of who and what is an administrator. i

Our figure of thirty administrators, of whom five are women
(after the elimination of Eysenhach's and Dentel’s positions)
includes all the individuals listed under “Administration,”
with the exception of administrative assistants, counselors,
and the health service and physical plant operations. These
positions we classified as “staff.”

Our definitions and numbers were discussed with and
clarified by several faculty members. In addition these
statistics were verified by Dean Walker’s administrative
assistant. It is interesting to note that she did not include
her own position in counting administrators.
