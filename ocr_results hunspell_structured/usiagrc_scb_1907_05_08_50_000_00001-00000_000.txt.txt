The Iowa. College baseball team won
its fourth straight victory Monday by
defeating the Nebraska University
team eleven to (our. She earned sever.
al of her runs by good smooth work

from the error making Nebrasiraus.
First class team play supporting a
heady pitcher was tile rule on the
Grinnell side, while the University
men insisted in iorgetting all they
knew about the game,

The third Nebrasilan in the lirst
inning got u ilit but it was valueless,as
the ﬁrst two and rourth got themselves
put out at ﬁrst. C rinncll pusheda run

pass followed by a two base: byFisheI.
An error and hit got another in the
second while Blake of Nebraska got a
nice two hagger. Fisher and Klein

plate. Ill the fourth an error put
Bauder in lirst and Dodge‘s three bagr
ger brought him in, Dodge scoring at
once on another error. , Nebraska kept
getting a hit now and tllen but
couldn'tiorce a run till the seventh
when an error and two hits got it. In
the second halior tlle seventh someone
threw a brick in the machinery, a list
or errors ioliovving iieldels choices let
in tour runs, the Nebraska ﬁrst base-
man and catcher vieing with each
'other in error making. They mistook
the ball ior a lemon and dodged when-
ever it came theirway, The universi-
ty men had too much kindness to pack
into one inning and in the eight the
inn continued, passes and errors scar-
ing three more for Grinnell In the
ninth the Scarlet and Black men got
jealous of the attention the Nebraska
airship attracted and started a srde
show or their own. Result, three runs

machine had cooled Oil ii“. showed a. re-
cord of eleven scores for Grinneli and
{curler Nebraska.

All the runs were not made on the
diamond. In the sixth Dodge sprinted
(or the tence to chase a long riy and
made a spectacular catch. A moment
after Weeks did exactly the same
etunr, both times the ball seeming
clear out of reach,

Both pitchers worked hard. Barber’s
head work was the more appeeciared
by his team mates, however, and ex-
cent in the ninth inning kept the in-
ﬁeld hermetically sealed
