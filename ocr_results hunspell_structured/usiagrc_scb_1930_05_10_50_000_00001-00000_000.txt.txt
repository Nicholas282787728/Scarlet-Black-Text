Varsity Beats
Drake Friday
in Track Meet

Grinnell Takes Dual Contest
by Score of 78 to 53
at Ward Field.

Local Frosh Beaten

Drake Freshmen Show Strength.
in Fidd Events to Win,
93 1-3 to 37 2-3.

The Grinnell varsity track team
scored its eighth consecutive win
by downing the Drake‘ cinder artists
here yesterday afternoon, 78 to 53.
The Bulldog freshmen took away
some of the sting of the varsity de-
feat by negotiating a 93 1-3 to 37 2-
3 victory over the little Pioneers.

The Grinnell win came mainly
through unexpected strength in the
field events, the Pioneers collecting
first places in the discus, javelin,
shot-put and the high—jump. The
freshmen were only able to gather
wins in the mile run and the broad»
jump, allowing the Bullpups thirteen
firsts.

rodrobarac High

Podrebarac of Drake was high
score man of the meet, his ten points
Corning from wins in the high and
low hurdle events. Douglas and
Murray, both of Grinnell, tied for
second honors by accounting for
nine points. For the yearlings, Cun-
ningham and Hyland of Drake and
Alexander and Pilbrow of Grinnell
were the most outstanding perform-
ers. Cunningham turned in a win
in the two-mile run and a. second in
the mile. Alexander and Pllbrow
each contributed a first place for the
Grinnell frosh.

The Bulldogs jumped into the
lead when they slammed the century
dash, but Grinnell was not to be out
done and came through almost im»
mediately with threev’plhczs in the
mile. In both the hurdles Podrebarac
toppled the barriers in great fashion
to pull away from Hensley, Grinncll
threat.

Fight ill Quarter

Captain Robert Mark took a first
in the quarter mile but interest cen-
tered mainly on the fight between
Gordon of Drake and Pelletiel‘ of
Grinnell for the second position, the
Pioneer runner finally winning out
by a scant foot.

Alexander. Scarlet and Black fresh-
man sprint star. got off to a bad
start in the yearling 440, but thrill-
ed the stands whith a spectacular at-
tempt to pass the leaders. falling
short by a mere length.

Pllbrow ran a beautiful race to
win the freshman mile. He trailed
Cunningham of Drake on the final
lap but managed a nervy sprint to
pull in ahead. The two—mile run, in
which the varsity and freshmen ran
together, allowed several yearlings to
finish ahead of their varsity team-
mates. The man who finished third
for the varsity event was the sixth
runner to cross the finish line.

‘lce’ Theme Friday
of Annual Banquet

"Ice“ Was the theme of the
four toasts given at the annual
sophomore-senior banquet last night
in the quadrangle dining room. Lee
Alexander acted as toastmaster.

“Breaking the Ice,” by Ruth
Goodenow. president o: the sopho—
more class, was a hon voyage to
those about to graduate. Eva Adams
responded for the seniors with a
toast entitled "Crossing the Ice."

The last two talks were made by
Richard Phillips and Dean John S.
Nollen, on "Chipping the Ice" and
'Melting the Ice." The former men-
tioned the value of organizing life
and the latter told of the import-
once of time.

The decoration theme was red
and white. Tulips and bridal wreath
were the ﬂowers. The waiters and
waitresses were freshmen in red and
white sport clothes. The Central
gil'ls’ candy chorus followed the same
theme, and a novelty dance hy Helen
Green, “I Don’t Want To Get Her-
ried." showed the same color com-
bination.

less collegians tonight. do what they
may. Three out of eight recipients
of gift horses last year have spent
this year in foreign nelds, not daring
to persist in the quest of the
diploma. Pete Fox, who got the
rope halter and leather medal for
throwing the "line" most successful—
ly; Madeline Johnson who was hon—
ored with the purple opera hose, and
Jo Barnes of the high flying line
were the three on whom the curse
proved most effective.

Chuck Parish, whose sophistication
was deemed worthy of the green
gloves, and Kate Coggeshall, whose

blithe innocence won the daisy, are
the only ones of the legion whom

 

Dick Phillips condemned who are
still in school. Whether the stern
fate Lachesis will allow these to live
down their curse and get diplomas,
only the oracles of the future can
say.

The brown bonnet and brown derby
are the real benedictions bestowed.
Schuyler Hunter and Madge PrDuty,

But here's a real moral for the
undergraduate. Elton Follette, who

got Phi Beta Kappa.

Miss Ann Jarvis
Was Originator
of Mother’ 3 Day

Miss Ann Jarvis, a Philadelphia
of the school board of Grinnell, and
Miss Norma Dietrich, supervisor of
music at Tama. _

The exact date of the origin of
Mother's day is uncertain, but it is
known that it was made a bill in
congress in 1912. Pres. Woodrow
Wilson suggested the bill which was
passed and ordered the ﬂag to be dis-
played on this day. The second Suna
day in May was designated and Miss
Jarvis chose the red and white carna-
tion as the emblematic flower.

Miss Jarvis spoke of her plan to
her friends and wrote to prominent
men of the country cenooringnao
idea. Her effort was rewarded by
publicity in newspapers, and as a re-
sult the idea spread rapidly. Today
this movement is observed all over
the world.

High School Track Athletes
Battle Mud to Reach Finals

in Grinnell Interscholastic

Grounds Dry Rapidly for Events This Afternoon;
Rain Slows Times of Qualifying Men

in Morning Preliminaries.

Newton Continues to Rank as Favorite

East Des Moines, Davenport, Mason City, Loom as Point Winners;
Hyland of Northwood Shows Ability in'Sprtnts,
Kenny of Mason City in Hurdles.

. BY KEN CLAYTON
(Campus Editor of The Grinnell Scarlet and Black).

WARD FlELD.——Fighting their way through mud and water in a
fashion that was reminiscent of the 1929 meet, the Iowa high school athletes
went through their paces in the qualifying races of the Twenty-Third Annual
Grinnell college Interscholastic meet here this morning with slow times.

Rain early in the day and through
out the first part of the morning
covered the cindcrs’with water and
in some cases caused good men to
lose their strides and perhaps to lose
a place in the finals. The weather
cleared after the first preliminary.
however, and the track was drying
rapidly with every indication that it
would be in first class shape for the
afternoon.

In order to further the process of
drying, college men were burning
kerosene on the broad jump and pole
vaulting pits. The track will be roll-
ed this afternoon and it is possible
that the starts may be slightly de-
layed.

Bisom of Newton Good

Despite the water covered lanes,
class was evident in many of the
races. Bisom of Newton and Hy-
land of Northwood ran easily in the
century and seemed to have little
trouble winning their heats. Hyland
also looked like a winner as he trot.
ted in first in his 220 beat, scarcely
panting. . '

Kenny of Mason City turned in
the fastest qualifying time in the 220
yard low-hurdles and in doing so
spent his time watching the men fol-
lowing him. Kittrell of West Wat~
erloo showed good form in the high
barriers, but had to work to qualify
in the lows. He should give Kenny
a good race in the shorter event.

Mason Cit-y strong In Dost-es

Mason City appeared strong in the
hurdles and dashes, Moore doing the
sprinting and Kenny the hurdling.
With Kohl in the distances, they
may prove more of a threat in the
meet than had been at first expected.
Newton, Davenport and East Des
Moines still reign as top favorites to
win, however. The tragedy of qual—
ifying races was displayed in several
of the events this morning, but it
was perhaps most evident in the sec-
ond bent of the 2204yard dash when
Moore, Mason City, Fueher of Wash,
ington High of Cedar Rapids, and
Riedsel of Clinton were judged in
that order although they finished al-
most neck and neck.

It was a colorful throng that view-
ed the events this morningihigh
school visitors intermingled with
college students, freshmen handling
the hurdles and sewing as handy
men of the affair, coaches lounging
about the finish marks, raincoats

Eight Women Win ‘
in Speech Contest

Eight women were chosen Wed-
nesday afternoon to compete in the
ﬁnals of the Mrs. H. W. Spaulding
reading contest, which will take
place in Herrick chapel on the eve-
ning of May 23. Katherine Gilles-
pie, Luella thl, Lois Klatt, Virginia
Riniker, Faith Somers, Betty Spauld-
ing, Mildred utley and Margaret
Wood were the ones selected.

The contestants will give selec-
tions for the most part poetic or
dramatic, and will be judged on de-
livery. The prizes from the fund
left in 1909 by Mrs. Spaulding are
twenty-live, fifteen and ten dollars.

The contest should he made par-
ticularly interesting this year by the
fact that three of the ﬁnalists com-
peted last spring, too. These are
Misses Gillespie, Hall and Utley, of
whom the ﬁrst two took second and
third last spring. Another feature
of the contest will be the reading of
Betty Spaulding, granddaughter of
the donor of the prize.

' Mary Gould is spending the Week-
end at home in Mason City.
