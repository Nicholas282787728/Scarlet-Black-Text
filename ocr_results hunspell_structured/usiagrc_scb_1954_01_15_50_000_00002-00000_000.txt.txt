Viva La Tradicion

“The Student Council protests the change in the regis—
tration system to an alphabetical arrangement, and recom—
mends an immediate change to retain the old system."

We’ll second that, heartily. The students who are now
required to register at the end of the week will, if history
is any lesson, find that the most popular cour S are filled.
And those students who are scheduled to register at the
beginning of the week may have trouble clealing their
schedules with busy advisors in time. The old method of

“first come, first served" was far better.
Students who knew that their courses were liable to

be filled
Others,

quickly made a special effort to register early,
whose courses were not so popular, took their time,

But under the new alTangement, no one will be happy.
If the new plan isn’t thrown out, as the Student Coun-

cil asks, it would be a

good idea to lead a boycott of the

Registrar‘s office from Monday through Thursday, and

have the

student body wait until Friday to registrer.

To the editor:

We have, in the distant past,
heard that Grinnell is to have
a new constitution for its stu-
dent government, We think that
it is a very necessary step if a
student government is going to
exist as z. gwerument at Grin-
nell,

It was also indicated that
this Constitution would be ready
for student approval this year.
Since then we have heard Vir-
tually nothing except that 'an
overly large committee is
working on it. We would like
to know what they have ac»
complished.

It is our Dpi ’on that the ads
ministration believes the Grin-
nell student body incapable of
governing itself except in mat~
Ders that are so trivial that they
are almost not the responsibil-
ity of a government. So far the
action of the Constitution com»
mittee Seems to bear out this
belief, Perhaps this could
change if the administration
and thew Student body were
aware of what the committeeis
doing, of what points they are
in disagreement, of what points
they agree on, or just what
points there are to agree or
disagree on: then the commit—
tee could find what the popu-

The’ Editor

lar sentiment is. Perhaps then
a draft of a workable consti-
tution could be made,

in a few weeks the Student
Council convention will meet.
If promises of the past could
be kept, his convention could
be a constitutional convention.
This accomplished,
then the administration might
regain a little respect for the
Student Body of Grinnell.

MOURNERS

—hy Ed Laing

This Saturday will be a sort
of Grinnell anniversary. The
dance intramural is being held
Saturday night, and that means
that two years have passed since
a very important announcement
was made

A dance
the inadequacy of the Grin~
nell College library was given,
and an eminent college official
arose right afterward and an—
nounced that he had received
some sort of definite communi-
nation that indicated that a new
library annex or some such
thing was on its way.

I’m still Waiting, Maybe I'll
throw a party Saturday night.
That’s probably all there will
be to celebrate for many more
anniversaries. Have to celebrate
something.

u r .

Speaking of anniversaries,
there’s a sort of tradition being
built up in Cowles Hall: On
several occasions how we’vehad
to fight off the mice that in
vade the upper regions of the
hall after the dining room closes
uprfct vacations. ‘Emboldened by
the rhythmic hunger pangs, they
lose all fear or man and will
even come surging out of the
walls in the daytime.

I encountered one last week.
(Whizzer Weitz told me one had
a litter in this room last year.)
I was in bed when I heard him
rummaging about in my waste-
basket. I snapped on the light.
seized a wooden shower dog
and went ﬂailing after che var-
miint, But to no avail; he dis-
appeared.

1 repeated the clever ruse for
uhree hours until 1 was ex
hausted and the mouse was a
nervous wreck. I know he was
a nervous wreck because I fin-
ally got 'rid of him through a
brilliant plan that consisted of
opening my door, crawling back
into bed and watching: He
came out and began gnawing
ifuriously at the door and‘ Imust
‘have been nearly exhausted
himself when Ihe realized that
the door was open.

I Slammed and locked the
‘door behind him and tried to
‘control the spasmodic twitch—
ings of my clog hand. 1 really
didn't mind him rummaging
about my room; God knows
there's no edible ioodl in Cowles,
But he kept me awake rattling
the newspapers and running up
and down the drapes, and he
seemed to have no discretion at
all.

And now Rumley says that a
mouse in his wall is driving
him batty With his noisy plaster
chewing. Wohdcr where it came
from.

It!

The new registration plan,
cleverly devised to her every
xouruh person from popular
courses, had a curious genesis.
The rumor is that the admin-
istration is afraid the ad build-
ing will fall in- if the students
come crowding in to register on
the ﬁrst day, as they are
alleged 'to have done in the past.

The plan, which would re-
gister people quasi-alphabetical-
ly (or second semester courses,
will aid nothing and may wreck
a lot of students’ sdhedules.
What with more graduation rc-
quiremenlts being slapped on
every year since the veterans
left, you can’t chord to miss a
course you need or you're not
likely to graduate

Oh well, I suppose they're

proving the: traditions can die—
but why did they Ihave to kill
a uselﬁul one?

Council Pro’res’rs By Letter
New Sys’rem of Registration

The Student Council has
sent a letter to the Registrar
protesting the change to an al-
phabetical system of register-
ing and recommending that the
old system be retained this
year. It was also suggested that
special provision be made for
those whose .work schedules
make special programs neces~
sary.

Ed Llining will contact Norris
Neveln (Controller) concerning
a protest or the Student Coun-
cil to the action of the Treas-
urer’s office in limiting the ap-
propriations from the semester
fee to various activities. It was
reported th 3 t organizations
will receive only 88% of the
appropriations granted them
this semester ﬂlrough the sem
fee. It has been stated that this
limitation was necessary be»
cause some students pay their
sem fee by imtallments, and
the funds are not complete.

It was also mentioned tllat
bills for damages in halls are
sometimes presented under
questionable circumstances. or.
ten ii is not ascertained wheuier
or not the ottenders were mi-
dents of the hall in which the
damage occurred.

Bill Platt recommended that
an investigation he made of the
library lighting facilities, and
that new installations, possibly
of individual desk lamps, be
made.
