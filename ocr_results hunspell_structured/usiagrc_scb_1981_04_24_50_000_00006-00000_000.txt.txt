Yearbook projects ‘new image’, name

by Laura McDermith

Grinnell's yearbook has a new image
ior 1min. Along with some organiza-
tional Changes Editor Dan Flynn decid~
ed that changing the name would in-
dicate a complete departure irom the
last iew yearbooks that didn't live up to
their potential.

At the same time. however, Flynn
didn't want to set a precedent (or new
yearbook names every year. The new
name, the Cyclone, is really the old
name which was changed to the Grin-
neil Book about seven years ago. Even
the size and cover at the lmsl year
book will be different. Instead of being 9

be 81/; x it. which sacrifices some
layout space but gains extra pages. The
cover will be soft, which is less expen-

Stimulating the most conversation of
the evening, Mike Celina moved that

the administration and to the Relays

durable and attractive; Flynn called it
“flexible but firm.”

Flynn thinks this year's book will be
more organized than last years. The
mm yearbook was incomplete in
many ways, For instance, not all dorm
floors, groups or faculty members Were
included. Flynn is proud of the {act that
he and his photographers achieved 100
percent floor response. Though it is dil-
l’icuit to get a group of people in one
place at one time, Flynn estimates that,
on the average, 30 percent 01 floor
members are included in the dorm pic-
titres.

There are twice as many groups pier
tured in this year's yearbook than last
year's, The staff is working hard to in-
clude all the faculty and they have tried
to make it as easy as possible tor the

There were some questions as to how
Relays made the decision not to have
the pit. It was suggested that the Relays
Committee had not properly research-
ed student opinion on the matter.

Dari Nissenbaum suggested that
there are some problems with the mud
in the dorms but the , mud pit is a
big part of Relays." He ollered a friend-
ly amendment to the proposal including
suggestions lor hosing the mud oil
revelers belore they contaminate their
dorm showers. Cetina accepted the
amendment.

Emphasizing that rowdiness and
abandon are a part of Relays, Rowe
pointed out, “You don't carefully sip
your beer so you don't spill it on your
shirt (at Relayst." He pointed out that
getting dirty and going a little crazy is

iaculty to respond.

Sales are good this year; already 300
books have been ordered and only loo
more books need to be sold to reach Hie
hreakeven point. Ad sales have also
been strong. Flynn expects to break
even and he hopes to make some proﬁt
to help pay the deiicit carried over irom
past year. Flynn attributes the high
sales partially to the reputations at his
two head photographers, Joel Aach and
Karl Dukstein The quality ol the
photography is consistent With the
reputation of the two photographers;
there are "no bad photographs," accor-
ding to Flynn.

Flynn closed with a compliment to
the Cyclone staff who are, in his own
words. “competent and hard working."

Defenders of the Relays Committee
painted out that the committee was tryr
ing to change the lace uf Relays. Omit-
ting the mud pit was cited as Just one oi
the many efforts the committee has
made to turn the tide oi decreasing
Relays attendance, "I don‘t think it's a
necessary part of Relays,“ commented
Eric Secoy, The vote was taken and the
motion passed. 1177.

Following the meeting, President
Paul anker commented that this
resolution, . . has to be one of the
most asinine things that JB has ever
voted on (The decismnl clearly [ails
under the responsibility or the Relays
Committee." Despite those feelings. he
pointed out that he would carry through
JB's wishes as he was directed.
