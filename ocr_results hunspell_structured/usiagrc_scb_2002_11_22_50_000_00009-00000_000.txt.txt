‘Not the normal medical
model of depression’

in turning to alternative forms of therapy such as self~hypnosis and meditation, a student not only bucks
the trend to medicalize depression but discovers the power of herself

“People think of: lor of things when they hut rhe word
suicide," Berh* sold. ”My seeond semesrer sophomore year, I
was thinking u lot or my own..." she chose her words catc-
rully, “viewer, not rhnr I neeesssrily sinnred ro lull myself."

Now n senior, Berh‘s thoughts on deorh sprung from
unxiery srrseks she hegin to love rs r sephome snd the
depression she believes resulted from this anxiety. She
sought onr rhe college‘s mental henlrh resources, includ-
ing the free visits {0 the I‘owcshiek County Mental Hedlth
Center.

“I wait to the Mental Health Center." shesnid, “and found
them to be unhelpful. I wanted summons to address my lrn»
medisre eoneerns, rhe onxiery rrrrehs espeeinlly, heeruse I
knew rhey were s major esuse of my depression

“At the Mcntnl Health Center. they thought the amcks
were yusr a side issue, and rhsr my red problem was my teln-
rionship wirh my rnnnly, my relrrionships wirh my friends,
my relationships wirh men."

Beth disagreed with this method of trmtment. ‘Their
upproseh wrs, ‘weli medieure your in iery, nnd rhen spend
monrhs talking re yon shour your perserul problems: i felt
that ifI went offtheit medication, I wasn't sure ifthe anxiety
would [continue re] go mvsy."

Dissatisﬁed with her experience at the Mental Health
Center and uncomfortable with the suggestion of medial-
tion, Beth turned to an RLC.

“Iwcntto [former RLC] John Motinscy, He vlnsn’t my RLCs
butI thought he was the RLC I could best milk to. He was very
helpful. We erllred sheer golng on mediml lewe so I wouldn't
have to ﬂunk out ofschool," she said, “Fortunately, diis all hdp-
prised right hetero Spring Break; over hrrsrlc l visired n drempisr
or home who speeiuins in slrernsrwe rhempy nnd slremsrive
medicine."

While spprehensive about medresrion, Berh was open re
such rrenrmenrs rs self-hypnosis nnd medirrrion Awnre or
the Image rhnr comes re msny peoples minds when rhey
think ehour hypnosis, Beth wrs quick re dispel rhis image.

“I wns taught self-hypnosis by being hypnomed by my
rhersprsr," she explmned, “our not in the funny, rrsdiriennl
sense orpeopir being onstage i-typno
sis is :xuemc relaxation, and being
given promprs to think nhonr an im»
age or r piece,

“Arsemepoinr,semednngulrerever
and you're discovering things in sddirien
ro whsr you're rlrerdy envisioning, rrnd
from rhis yon ctn ﬁnd our whrr ninlres

No longer so rmeuendy depressed,
ssd, snd rrrsions, Berh thinks rho sl.
rernsrwe merhods she's used re Heather

served her well. She likes rhe Immedir

nirrr selﬁhypnosls, r reeling she wot»
nos she would nor have experienced
wirh medierrion,

"l’ve never been on medienrien so 1 don’r know how it
makes you feel." she snid, “But after self-hypnosis, I slnrosr
immedinrely feel more or ense and in control. wirh self-hyp-
nosis, I'm eonndenr I'll he olsry, I‘m in control, i err. fix the
pinhlem myself"

Anorhrr benefit ofselfrliypnosis is rhsr Beth has hereme
“rerlly in rune" wrrh her hedy, rn rhe porn. where she ern
“loci nn rnxiery attack coming on snd prevent u."

"At some point] something
takes over and you're
discovering things in
addition to what you’re
already envisioning, and
from this you can ﬁnd out
what makes you depressed]

hypnosis hes ennhled her re hsve. But Beth’s concerns about
snrrdeprrsssnrs extend beyond herself. she is skeprresl shour
rhe general inclination to medicalize depression.

“The prehlem is people vvsnr depression ro he like r 1er
ororherdrsessss in which everyone experiences rhe same prob»
lems sud therc ere symproms yon enn observe and serions
you run take re treat rr," she ssid. “This assumes [depression]
is something you an euro. 1 don'r know iFit’s something that
run be cured."

This is nor ro soy Bern eould never
Imagine ﬁghting her depression wirh
medication. “I think everybody deals
wirh depression on u eonrinuurn oflnr
rensiryr" she ssid.

“Perhaps iFI had been higher up
on that eenrrnnnrn. i would have mud:
n drherenr [rrenrmenr] eheiee. [But] i
relr rhnr 1 was low enough rhrr rhere
were slrernsrivels] [re mediorrion for
treating my depression]."

Beth eonelnded that, uirimrrely,
rhe method ofdeprcssion rrenrmenr is
up re the individual, be it drugs or self-
hypnosis or talk therapy.

“You've got to deal with rhe prob-
lent the wsy you need to deal with rr,"
she snid. "I would nevercriticize someone forgoing en medi.
cationv irwe reel depression is something we're going re live
wirh for rhe resr or our lives, we’ve got re do whsr mrlres us
reel hsppy nnd what makes us eomrorrshle. rnd rhir ern he 1
nu mher of things "

The mesr imperrnnr thing, Beth has found, is consis»
reney in rrr-rrmrnr. “Practi ‘ 1g is good, heenrsewhrle l don’r
