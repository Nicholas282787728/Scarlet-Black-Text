lSysteinatic Theology at the Chis
WOI (640) OTHELLO—Part l

cagu Lutheran Thelogical Semis Curvature

Duane Blough, president of
the student council, by limiting
the service to thirty mmutes‘
yesterday. introduced a new
trend in Thursday morning
chapel programs at Grinnell,

This enables students to coin- '

bine chapel with cottee and
crispies. His theory is that what
can be said in sixty minutes
- can be said just as well in
thirty minutes.

When he stated his topic
Thursday morning, Duane said,
“I want to.tliink with 'you
about this subject — The Real
You a not for you."

“The real you is blocked when

\nearby standards replace those
farther away in nature and
help determine the conduct of
the individual," said the pl‘eslr
dent. Many times the desire to
remain favorable in the eyes oi
our friends prohibits» us from
bringing forth our honest opin-
ions.

“When you have decided that
an action is wrong you should
avoid it. But when you have de-
cided what is right .why should
you tear those who mightﬂl‘ltr
icize‘ you and so be secretive
about your demsion’!” Some-
times it seems proper _to refute
the truth, but down through
the ages great men have lived
under the theory that "God
rindeth satisfaction in truth."

The Student Council, of which
he is president, is the initial

( The council is an organization
of double student representation.
Each class elects representatives
and each hall and cottage sends
a representative to the meetings.

year’s members in their spring
elections. The women elected rep-
