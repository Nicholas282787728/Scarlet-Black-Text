record in the 440-yd. medley re-
lay. Norman and Murray repeat

can get by these three toughies,
they will be in the best possible
shape for the final three games.

Monmouth has surprised
everyone by winning seven of
its eight games since Christ-
mas vacation. Going into the
three-week lay-oft it had lost
s'x games in a row, but is now
tabbed by many observers as
the best team in the league.
Last week saw the Scots dis-
pose oi both st. Olaf and
Carleton in convincing fashion.
Clair Mchoberts, a 6’4” soph-
omore, is Monmouth’s leading
scorer with a 16 point per game
average. tie is followed by Carl

Hoopes slands out with a con-

The return battle between
Grinnell and Cornell should be
bitterly fought after the Pio-

Mount Vernon last week. Cor—

over 12 points in their game av-

Last week-end arinnell
traveled to Lawrence and
Ripon for a pair of victories.
Lawrence went down 1458,
