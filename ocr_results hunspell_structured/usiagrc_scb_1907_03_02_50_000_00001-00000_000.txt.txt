Chrestomathian Freshmen Win.

Judges Give Unanimous Decision in wen.
ncsday Night's Debate nerween
Chresro and lnsriruve.

Before a small but enthusiastic
audience, consisting largely oi the
men of the college literary societies,
the representatives or the Chrestoma-
Lilian society deieaterl Grinnell Insti-
tute in the second annual Freshmen
contest. The debate was close and
exciting throughout and there was
keen interest in the argument of
every speaker. Every one of the six
men taking part made an excellent
showing and the Freshmen have again
demonstrated their ability to amply
handle one of the regular inter-society
contests.

The question discussed was, Resolv-
ed: that in cities of over 100,000 popu-
latiunin the United States, the ad»
ministrative and executive powers
should be vested in the mayor. The
veto power is granted the mayor as an
administrative function; the comp-
troller and treasurer to be elected.
The Chrestos had the allirmative and
were represented by .i. P. Moore: J. A.
Burner and R. \V. ilulchlns. Grin-
nellInstitute defended the negative
and her representatives were 11. L,
Brundage; Geo. Clark and J. L.
Murphy.

Mr. Moore Opencd the debate for
the ailirmative with a general survey
or the erlls of city government. He
outlined the issue of the debate asa
separation of powers. Many cities
were quoted as upholding the mayor
system and many of the old familiar
gralters, notorious in city administra-
tion, were brought in.

Mr. Brunrlage Opened the debate [or
the negative. He maintained that
the system or government in the larg-
er cities today did not lit the existing
Conditions The modern trend was to
regard a city as a huge business cor-
notation and the present systems or
political bosslsm did not serve as busi-
ness administrations,

Mr. Darner continued theargument
for the allirlnative. The question in
volved was a matter'oi principle and
should be discussed as such, IIis are

the debate, the separation of powers,
He claimed ior this, lst, srmplided

Mr, Clark was lire second negative
speake . His speech was entirely a
refutation Di the claims of tile allir~
mative. He maintained that the
mayor system did not meet the mod-
ern demand or civic reiorm principles
ior, did it provide asatisiacrory bu i.

lived again last night on the platiorm
at the Congregational church when
Leland Powers gave several delight-
ful scenes from the English norelists’
”David Copperﬁeld.” The scenes and
situations selected were those which
brought into prominence the more
sharply drawn characters of the story
and worlred our two or the many sub-
plots Woven into a. Dickens tale. The
stories of Uriah Heep and Little
Em’ly gave the reader an opportunity
to deal with the most clearly deﬁned
characters and change rapidly from
tliepompous Micawber to the cringr
inn, “ ’umble" Mr. Heep and the
pathetic iigure or uncle Peggotty,
All of these were ﬁnished and perfect

A Faculty Lecture Series.

Each ncpartmem to be Represented on
rhe Platiorm by one or Its Protes-
sors.7Firsr one Marchmh,

A series of lectures which promises
to he oi great interest and value is
now being planned by the iaculty.
Six years ago the proiessors in the
science department arranged a course
oi illustrated lectures and the chapel
was crowded at each one. Much iri~
terestwastuken in them and not a
little proﬁt gained, but {or some rea-
son they were not continued,

Now, however, the whole iaculty
have united in giving a course of six
lectures, one pertaining to each de-
partment or knowledge The matter
discussed will be along the line oi the
subject in which each professor is in-
terested, but the purposeis to make it
entertaining as well as instructive.
The aim or the project is’ primarily to
place the diderent faculty members
before other studenls than those in
their own classes and in turn to give
the students glimpses into other lines
of worlr than those which they are
pursuing. Anotherrcasou is that the
people or Grinnell should be given an
opportunity to hear the college Iaculr
ty in their respective departments of
work,

These lectures will be free to all
and will be given, beginning with
March 12, on sixconsecutire Tuesday
evenings. The iirst will be horn the
science department. “Our Friends,
The Bacteria" by Pro! Canard, On
March 19, Prof. Stoops will lecture on
“Psychology in Life.” The subiects
iromthe Modern and Ancient Lau—
guage. English and the Music depart-
ments have not been iully decided
upon but. these lectures will probably
be given by Professors Perring,5miley,
Smith and Mallory,

MACY AT FROHIBITION MEETING.

The meeting or the Prohrhiriou
League Wednesday evening was led
by Proi. Jesse ilncy and was along the
line or the proressorlspersonal reminis-
cences orthe growtn or the temper
auce movement in iowu. The leader
told or the early Prohibition low or
18%, the modiﬁcation 0' it in 18”? and
the constitutional nmendmentol ism,
which was declared nulland void by
the Supreme Court on a technicality.
After this action a
starred

movement was
to secure this amendment
again by clrrtinv rudges vlllo unlllri
reverse rhc pre ous (leclslun. Prof.
Macy uppm‘rd this measure het’auKe
he thought ille way to reach evil Ms
through public sentiment which
would place Prohibilloll lnvn in omce
and through prohibltory laws rather
than through amendments.

It is the professors opinion that
there is enough sentiment in luwa
now to wipe out the liq'lor traliic but
that its ﬁnal settlement will only be
had by initiative, and by I referen-
duro by whicha man may stand by
his party candidates and still vote
