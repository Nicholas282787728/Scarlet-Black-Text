Freshman Women
Being Helped in
Exam Preparation

A new project whereby treshman
women are being given a chance
to get better organizcd for their
first taste of semester examina.
tions is being undertaken by Mor-
tar Board, women‘s honora y
scholastic society.

According to Alice Mcacham,
president of the organization,
most of the women do not know
how to study for examinations of
this sort. It will be the duty of
Mortar Board to try to instruct
then. in the methods of both pre-
paring for and writing examina-
tions.

started Tuesday.

The project, which started Tiles-
day, will last until the beginning
of the reading period. Women in
study hall, because they are either
campused or on probation, are ex-
cused to attend the meetings.

The meetings are being held in
Cleveland basement and are pie-
sidcd over by one member of
Mortar Board. Thc chairman an-
s -ers any questions the women
wish to ask and tries to help them
in any way possible.
Definite I’m-poser

”This new idea has a definite
purpose and should serve a very
good cause," Miss Meacham points
ed out. “Too many freshmen go
into examinations not knownig
what to expect or what to do.“

I’ Seen as Real

 

Merit in Woodward’s Paintings

By Henry Alden.
For those who feel winter-bound
oven on such niild days as those
and who stiffer trom “sed-[evel-,"
may I recommend a visit to Mair
whom there will be on cxhi
until Feb. 5 a collection of w
colors and oils by Stanley Vtoiid
ward of Rockport, Maine.
Almost without exception these
are sea picture: Hcre Lhei‘e are
windy days “with the white clouds
ﬂying", here one flnds white sails
and gray dawns, flung spiny auJ
sea-gulls. in general the oil paint-
iiigs are heavy with the set om»
lilies and iicli colors of a poster;
they fail to convince us that the
watrr is wet and roll ot motion,

Thus they are less pleas. g
than the water—colois, that per-
hops is why they are hung- in the
dim drawing-room whereas the
water-colors are given thc excole
lent lighting of the corridor.
Certainly Mr, Woodw ~l is
more at home in the m spon-
Laneotls technique of water-color;
heie there is light and space and
motion. Even among the waters
colors none of the many y ws
of heavy seas breaking ugalilsl

rocky shores is quite convincing.
Probably the most successful is
Itllo "Grey Skles" that hangs on
the south wall (there is another
picture by the same name on the
cast wall), The ocean in “Grey
Skles” has a remarkable appca
ance o[ depth combined with ino-
tion

Morc . appealing than. the
straight sca-scapes are the seen
with boats, houses, and human
{igtlies, although the two bcacn
scenes with nudes have little "181'-
it beyond a charming tropical
sunnincss. Because of its Vigor
and dramatic action, my favorite
is "The Life Boat," which is lel‘i!»
nusccnt of Winslow Homer.

“The storm over Lanesvllle"
has an individual mood that is
lacking in the more stereotyped
shore lines and sailing boats. But
we would be foolish to carp at
the lack of artistic pcrfcction in
the pictures: their real merit is
the romantic appeal to all for
whom
“the callotthe
running tide
Is a wild call and a clear
thot may not be denied”

Loss Dims Pioneer
Valley Aspirations;
Luther High Scorer

By Clark A. Smith.

Drake's five iron men shattered
Grinnell's dreams of a Missouri
Valley championship last night by
turning in a handy 35 to 27 VIC-v
tory over the scarlet and blacks.

Except for a few minutes at
the beginning of each half, the
Bulldog five completely dominat-
ed the play and led in the scor-
ing column.

A Bad Night.

For the Pioneers, it was a had
night all around. They were off
in their shooting, taki lg 753 Shcts
at the basket and connecting on
only 16.

Often they failed to follow
their shots and lost thc ball with-
out opposition, as a consequence.
Besides this, they weren’t setting
up their plays and working- the
ball in toward the basket.
Bulldogs Arc Stubborn.

On the other hand, the Bulldogs
presented a stubborn defense. An
aggressive, scrappy outfit, they
played an excellent game around
the basket and got most of their
points on short tip as and sch
ups.
