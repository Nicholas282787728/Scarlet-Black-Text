A Year of Improvement - -

Next year Grinnell will have its full com-
plement of men students. There will be
adequate housing for the increased women's
enrollment. Plans are being made for
several new and modern buildings to be

erected on campus It looks like a year of
improvementifor everything but the col-
lege library. Within those hallowed’walls,
dedicated to Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and
their fellow immortals, life will go on
exactly as it has in the past.

Next year students will continue to
drowse over their books, mentally cursing
the poor ventilating system which causes a
rush every day for the seats near the wine
dow. Perhaps we might work out a rota-
tion system whereby each person changes
his seat every fifteen minutes, those next
to the windows moving farther in, and those
farther in moving closer to the source of
air, a sort of continuous circular movement.

Next year there will undoubtedly not be
clocks on' every wall. We may look for-
ward to another year of wondering what
time it is, and of being informed, upon hav-

 

ing trotted over to see the desk clock, that
it is 12:10 While the noon whistle is blow-
ing. Next year we shall all know enough
to go to the libe equipped with a pocket
knife. By then we shall have become
accustomed to not having a pencil sharp—
ener.

Next year, however, none of us shall
mind these inconveniences, because (it is
rumored) two coke machines are to be set,
up in the entryavay in lieu of a drinking
fountain. It is also rumored that every
desk in the library will be equipped with
its own sound proof telephone booth. This
will eliminate the necessity of hiring run-
ners to carry a message. And as a final;
and crowning achievement, (it is rumored),]
a special speedway tunnel will be built be»
tween the basement of the library and the
men’s washroom on first floor ARH.

Tag - You're l’r - -

Saturday, March 9, Grinnell enters a
new phase of its social life. At the behest
of the joint social chairmen committee, on
that day we will don tags bearing our
names. Also, we will attempt to foster a
new spirit of friendliness by saying “hello"
to each and every soul that passes by. If
our eyesight is good enough to read the tag
at a distance, we may even be able to tack
a name onto that “hello" before the tag-
bearer sails by.

The Scarlet and Black is all in favor of
this proposed movement for greater student
participation in Grinnell’s well-known at—,
mosphel'e of joviality and amiability. The
Grinnell Spirit should and must remain.
However, we have a proposal to make. Why
make Saturday, March 9, the only day for
friendliness? Why not extend the practice
of wearing tags to every day of the week?
Who knows but that, in time, we may grow
to know the names of each person on cam-
pus? We fear that when the tags have
been laid to rest in our memory books, we
will forget a lot of names that we want to
remember.

If we kept this tag day a long—term
Grinnell tradition, however, we could be—
come acquainted with just about everybody
by the time summer vacation rolls around.
We could make tags in different colors, or
have one for each day in the Week. Sakes
alive! We could even be saying “hello" to
eveﬁyone in the bookstore in the nine o’clock
rus .

The Scarlet and Black predicts a great
future for Tag Day.
