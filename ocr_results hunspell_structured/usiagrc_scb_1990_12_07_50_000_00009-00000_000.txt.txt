Simon
Releases
Lyrical
Saints

By Sarah Quimby
and Chris Doemel

It is difficult to review an artist
that has been popular for a long
time. These artists have the tre-
mendous burden of constantly
competing against the new genera-
tion of artists and tlleir previous
accomplishments. Paul Simon is
nocxccption. ltwastllereforewith
trepidation that we listened to his
new effort, Rhythm of the Saints.
Happily, none of our forebodings
were realized: Rhythm of the Saint:
is up to the standard of Simon's
previous works.

Like Graceland, Saints uses in-
digenous music as a focus, but
instead of the mhaqanga music of
South Africa, Simon uses the
rhythms and styles of Brazilian
music. The ﬁrst song on the CD,
“The Obvious Child," (performed
on Saturday Night Live several
weeks ago) begins with a rich.
vigorousdrumcadencethatisjoined
by guitar arld Simon‘s quintessene
Lial lyrics.

As inGmceland,Simon’slyrics
arebothbcautifulandtopical andal
Lima almost become poetry. In
"TheObvious Child," Simon sings,
“A cooling system burns out in the
Ukraine/frees and umbrellas pro-
tectusfrom thenew rain/Armies of
engineers to analyze the soil/the
food we contemplate the water that
we boil.“

Or in “Further to Fly:“ ‘There
may come a time/When you‘ll be
tired/As tired as adream that wants
to die/And further to fly/Funher to
ﬂy.” The songs range in subject
from his environment (given the
state of the South American rain
forests, and the current popularity
of that particular cause, this is not
surprising), political and social is-
sues, such as overpopulation, in
“Born attheRightTime") and love
songs, among others.

Except for “Spirit Voices” and
”The Coast,” Simon wroteall of the
songs on the CD, and all are up to
the level of Simon‘s earlier work.
The music is rich, beautiful and
intriguing.

Throughout this review, we re-
sisted the temptation to compare
Rhythm of the Saints to Graceland.
This is abad comparison toallempt,
partly because the only thing that
the albums have in common is the
lead artist. To be frank, itwoultl be
nearly impossible for Rhythm to
overshadow such a classic. We
think, however, that the same situ-
ation would probably be the same
had Rhythm oflhc Saint: come be-
fore Graceland. On the whole
Rhythm of the Saints is n thor-
oughly enjoyable album.

Group Exhibit Study
in Individual Technique

By Rina Saeed Khan

The current exhibition in the
Schacffer Gallery located in the
Fine Arts building is a striking and
powerful display of drawings by
three student artists: Kate Leonard.
William Thompson and Carlos
Ferguson. In the complex subject
of the self-portrait, each artist em—
ploys a highly individual and sub
jective style, enabling the artist to
explore issues such as gender and
definition of self.

This group exhibition is the re-
sult of an independanlprojectin the
graphics seminar, a course taught
by Crowley, The group met regu-
larly this semester for critiques.
Ferguson explained that they were
concerned primarily “with concep—
tual ideas which led to experimch
taLion with different techniques.”

Leonard‘scharcoaldrawingsare
extremely expressive. She ex
plained that in producing these
drawings, she was “not concemed
with realistic depiction, but rather
with the emotional aspect...how
emotions, moods relate to concep-
tual ideas.”Her“Woman with Gag"
isapowerfuldrawing,notonly due
to its large size and Lhe meaningful
image of a gagged woman, but in
the way the artist uses the strong
black/White conertsls of Charcoal
to delineate foml.

Thompson employs an innova-
tive linear style in his graphite
drawings. He uses horizontal lines

combined with a strong contour
line to delineate form. His
surpression of detail in his curir
ously elongated nudeflgures, which
are all surprisingly untitled, evoke
a certain mood; a visitor to the
exhibition described his nudes as
almost “eerie in their silence."
Thompson remarked that in treating
the male nude in such a life-size
manner, he wasinterested in seeing
“how it would effect the viewer.”

Ryker to Perform
Beckett's Absurdist

Happy Days

By Bill Hocnlan

PlaywrightSilmuclBcckcttdicd
one year ago this month, but that
has not kept the popularity of his
work froln the critical or theatrical
spotlight. Oncmightbc tempted to
say that now that Beckett is dead,
one may establish a concrete inter-
prclation of his works.

Unfortunately, this is and will
remain extremely difficult.

Case in point: Happy Days, the
third and last of Beckett's “long"
plays has been studied and inter-
preted since its first performance.
It has been played by some of the
most prestigious actors of our time.
yet it remains elusive. The actions
of the “heroine." Winnie, and her
seldom»seen husband Willlc are
minute: Winnic's movement is
limited as she is stuck up to her
waist in theearth (in the second act
she is stuck up to her neck). Shc
fumbles with a gun, medicine,
makeup, umbrella, and, most im-
portantly, her words. The audience

secs Willic onlyatbrietinlcrvals in
the play, though Beckett gave cx-
acting directions on how he should
emerge.

VisitingpcrforrncrsKarcnRyker
and Jason Oates will tackle this
problem when they present
Beckett's Happy Day: tomorrow,
Dec. 8, in Roberts Theater.

Grinncll’s last production of a
Beckett play, Endgame, will seem
lavish by comparison. There are
three mztln componentstolhis play:
an “expanse of scorched earlh’V
centered by Winnic's mound, a
backcloth which suggests abso-
lutely no possibility of change and
lighting which can only be likened
to Hell. All of the “acLion”~for
there is visually not much action——
occurs under these conditions.
Beckett, as the master of
minimalism andofthcnbsurd,pulls
out all of his theatrical stops in a
play which goes “beyond
minimalism." The play is spon»
sored by the Public Events Com-
miltce.
