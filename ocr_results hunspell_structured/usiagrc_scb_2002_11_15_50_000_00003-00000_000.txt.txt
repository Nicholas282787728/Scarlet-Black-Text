It’s not easy being an Iowan of mixed ethnicity, but a speaker at this week‘s Asian Students and far

pacific Northwest, a relatively racially diverse
region ofrhc coiiirtry, moving to Grinircll has
required some adaptation, Though this is his
fourth year here, Andrews is “still maldng ride

Not that occasions “where my otherness

This became “eminendy clear," he says, at this week’s ASIA sympo»
sium panel discussion on the subject “it seems to me that we are engaged

to get a response that perhaps just wasn’t there. “i

The current generation oiorinneil students may
never engage in the activism and “physical engage.

Grinnellians, including Andrews, believe that we
could be far more thorough and far more aware of
the way we “do" race. He cited Asian-American Lit.

acknowledged that faculty-hiring issues present a
major obstzcle to the introduction orsuch courses.

Eor Andrews, the lack of diversity on crinnells campus is a serious
problem. Though hesays “good faith attempts" are being made to remedy
the situation, and have been somewhat successful in the area of faeulry
hiring, he feels the college “needs to be more successful" in all regards,
particularly where student diversity is concerned.

A lapaiiesc woman recently told Miite Abel “02 that it's good he played
baseball in high school.

“it makes you a man," she explained

So far. Abel seems to be having a great time learning about the signiﬁr
cane: of baseball in different countries.

Last year, Abel won a Watson Fellows Scholarship and, with it, the
chance to turn $22,000 into the opportunity ofa lifetime, This year. he
gets to spend his prim on a project entitled “Williamspoit Bound: Yoridt
Baseball in Asia and Latin America." studying “cultural values through
the lens ofyourh baseball" in Japan, Taiwan and Venezuela.

The scholarship

Every year the Watson Fellows scholarship
provides the same opportunity to 60 seniors from
so eoilego and universities around the country
Just two things: you have to go to countries you've
never been to, and you earrnoi return to the Us
(or the country you're from) for one year.

Each year, the Ofﬁce ofSocial Development

considered the Wauon Fellowship her “chance to do something that is
not science/medicine related, " choosing to focus on her love of dance.

Ekcoduru's proycct, entitled “The Role of Carnival: in Creating a
Cultural Space for Afto-Caribbeans," would take her to TrinidzrlJamaim,
Curacao, die Bahamas, and the United Kingdom breoduru plans to study
"how Ali-chatibbeans use Carnival to embrace their African heritage,
mobilize and empower their culture in their continual struggle for pl)»
lilico»cconomic freedom."

Ekeoduru is “interested in examining how cultural identity deﬁnes a
group ofpcopic and determines how that group deals witlr opposition."
she plans to observe dances and reflect on what they symbolize within the

Jansen hopes to focus oit how Shakespeare's works are received and
interpreted in South Africa, Australia, and Trinidad,

“The research I have done on post-colonial Shakespeare falls into two
rough categories," wrote Janson in his personal statement, submitted to
the scholarship board last rveeic. “The ﬁrst is textual/historical
criticismr , ,The other category is criticism on contemporary postecolonial
performances worldwide, including analyses ofnew stagings, adaptations,
or interpretations ofShaicespcare’s works. I intend to draw from both
ofrhesc types ofcriricism in my analysis of post-colonial Shakespeare."

“diverse backgrounds" and aims to “help to increase the
numbers ofstudenis ofcoior on university campuses."

In addition, Grinnell changed irs policy for flying in
prospective minority students to visit campus. Now Stu»
dents must apply for this fly-in program, and must have
already begun the general application pieces. Under this
requirement. Sumner believes that only serious prospee.
tive students will ﬂy in. He therefore experts the change to
increase the enrollment of those taking part in the pro-
gram.

A new admissions brochure has also been designed to
attract prospective studeno of colon

Admissions also plans to visit more sdioois with high
minority populations, which‘is where programs like the
Chiago Recruitment Program come into play Such pine
grams aim to go beyond simple high school visitations and
reach potential students in alternative ways. Marlene jaelcs.
the coordinator of Chicago regional planning, explained
the measures as, “visiting community groups and ageneies
in order to inform and introduce students to the school."

Because many high school studeno who live on the
south side of Cirimgo do not have the ﬁnaneial means to
visit Gtinnell, on Nov. 5, anlcThemas and other admin-
istrators and faculty went to Chicago to present ciinncll
to high schoolers in the city. Head baseball coach Tim
Hollibaugh recently accompanied Jacks to a sludenlezthe
lete fair in order to idenriry the top student athletes from
the Chicago pubiicschoei system.

However, many students also feel that admissions
should not simply focus on this year’s low statistic. last
year was considered successful in enrolling AfriczncAi-netie
cans, though they made up only 5 percent of new stu-
dents.

While some cite that the cause for the low numbers is
based onAdrnissions flaws, otherstudenrsarequielc to point
out that AfricaneAmericans may choose not to come to
Grinneii based on problems with the college Community,

“There aren’t enough things on this campus that ap.
peal to black students,” said Dcnnericlca Brooisr ’04. “A: a
student of color you're going to look for what you can do
socially."

“The only place you can get BET is in BCC, in the
remotest comer nfcampus,” she said,

“students won’t want to eoirre unless they see (heme
selves reflected in the eommuniry," added Chattin.

Faculty: money, money

Chattin said that one way for African-American Stu-
dents to be reflected in this community is through Artie
saneArneriean professors.

Administrators, too, apparently believe in the impor-
ranec offaeuity diversity. both in educating and attracting
students.

“We feel that we need to better represent the diversity
oftiic nation," said Dean ofthe College Jim Swarre. “iris
an important part ofthe education ofout students to be
more diverse both in our faculty and our student body."

The administration and executive council have been
pushing departments to put faculty diversity as a priority.
“We're trying to bring more energy into diversifying the
pool [of potential faculty], and send the message to rice
partmenrs that diversity is something important to the col»
lege, and that they should try to find strong candidates of
color.” said Swarm.
