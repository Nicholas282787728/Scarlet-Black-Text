THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

By MAX ROSS

Even the metropolitan newspaper
statisticians have left the 1932 Mis-
souri Valley scoring rare in sornewlutt
of a muddle, for a few recent tabula-
tions seem to agree on just who is
leading the field,

sea

Both koss Hall of Oklahoma A. and
M. and Howdy Gordon of Creigl'rton
were tied with as points two weeks
ago for second place, but Hall, scor-
ing two touchdowns last Saturday.
has evidently wrested the leadership
from Gordon, who counted three times
against Wyoming. Discrepancy some
place.

A closer checkup reveals that Dick
Uurioh, ace of the Pioneor backfield,
only has 35 points, whereas he has
been credited with 37 and a tie for
first place for some weeks. Grinnoll
has scored 10 touchdowns, five points
after touchdown, and, one safety, and
unless which is given credit [or the
safety, which, of course, is out of the
question, he could not possibly stretch
his total to 37. It makes little differ~
ence now, however, as nail and dor—
don seem to usurp the spotlight,

The Pioneers chalked up a total of
67 points in the eight games, and
more than half of them were scored
by coach Wall’s great running and
kicking flash, Ullrich, Each of five
men found himself in a tie for second
place, although none of them has
scored more than once. The complete

Strangely enough, the longest run
from Scrimmage for a touchdown was
but mere 12 yards, when Wes Clark
took a lateral pass from Dick Ullrich
and scored against Michigan State.
Ullrich scored all five of his touch-
downs from plunges inside the 10—
yard line. Three of the 10 Pioneer
touchdowns came on passes. two by
James, and one by Clark. Each threw
a 20-yard pass to score against Cor-
nell, and James planted the hall in
Duncan’s arms on a spot pass just
over the goal against Creighton.

Chicago Physicist Disputes
Origination of Cosmic Rays

ANN ARBOR, Mich, (CNS)7Cosc
mic rays, instead of originating in his
terrstelldr space, probably come from
the earth’s own stratosphere, Dr.
Arthur E. Compton, University of
Chicago physicist, last week told the
National Academy of sciences.

In a summary of the results of the
experiments, conducted in various
parts of the world and at different al-
titudes during the past year, he again
took issue with the theory of Dr. Rob-
ert A. Millikan, head of the California
Institute of Technology, who believes
cosmic rays signal the creation of
matter in outer space.

“It seems very difficult to reconcile
with our data any of the alternative
hypotheses that have been suggested,"
he said.

He added, however. that cosmic
rays do have some important mes»
sage for scientists, but what that mes-
sage may he has not yet been estdbe
lished, although it is possible that they
are bringing news of the innermost
structure of the atomic nucleus.

Regions which produce the aurora
borealis may also be the birthplace of
cosmic rays, Dr. Compton's findings
indicated.

Dr. Compton said that his observa:
tions of the intensity and nature of
the rays, which he believes to be made
up of particles, rather than light
waves, indicate that they originate
some hundreds of miles above the sur-
face of the earth in the upper strato-
sphere.

The homicide rctaile . known to
the thrilleseeking public as Barnaby

will be lured from corpse—strewn
studies long enough to wrestle with
a ready-made and real mystery which
Captain Ayer will advance for their
solution. The one mystery which will
not be solved will be the real names

authors.
