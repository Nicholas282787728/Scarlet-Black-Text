one day this year, according to the
announcement or tile iaculty Commit
tee made today. To do this, the pro-
grams usually held on Saturday and
liouday trill be combined into one, and
will be on Saturday, Coimnellcemelll

iicsday us in past years, and ilonday
will he aluinni day.-

Tlic new program is in no way a
curtailment, but is rather a concen»
tration ot commencement activities,
The change is h n; made in accord
ance with the general plan which is to
make patriotism the predominant note
of commencement. it rvas thought by
the committee in charge that cutting
out a day from the time devoted to the
exercises would help to do this
