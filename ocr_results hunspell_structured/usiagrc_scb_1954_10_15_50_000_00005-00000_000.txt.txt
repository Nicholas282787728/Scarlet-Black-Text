T e three starting upsets by

have thrown the Midwest con-
ference grid race into a turmoil.
Carleton, ranked sixth at the be-
ginning of the season, now stands
at the top with a 4-0 record by
virtue of a stunning 14-13 win
over St. olaf, the defending
champs and preseason favorites,
It was St. Olaf‘s first grid loss
since 1952.

As far as surprises go. how-
ever. this was topped by Ripon's
14712 upset of Cce at Cedar
Rapids. The Ripon squad was an
almost unanimous preseason
choice for the cellar spot, where.

two teams with a chance of
dethroning St, olaf.

The third upset was Cornell’s
14-l3 win over Monmouth.

former -

. a .
little man has to be better than
a big man, due to the imposing
weight handicap. That Steve
fulfills this requirement can
easily be shown. In high school
as a 145 pound guard, he was
picked on the Ali-Intercity
team in Bloomington, ml, for
two Straight years, and lettered
in basketball and baseball.
Steve has been on the Grin.

nell varsity for all four years,
specialising on.d§fense under
the old two-platoon system.
Coach John Pfitsch calls him
an “excellent defensive line-
backer,” and notes that he is a
“fine ipass defender despite his
size.”

Game statistics prove that he
is one of,the best tacklers on
the Pioneer squad. Pfitsch add.
ed that Steve has “much ime
proved as an offensive blocker
during the past three years.”

This desire to improve him-
self is apparent when we learn
that he never played as liner
backer before coming to college.
Coach Bob Peterson remarked
that “Steve‘s swell attitude and
hard work have been major
factors in his success. He dis-
plays a lot of courage—when
you see him smear a much
heavier fullback, you tempore
arily fonget about his weight
disadvantage. When you re-
member it, you are amazed that
Steve has been injured less
than most players on the team."

Turning from the gridiron.
we find that Steve manages to
find enough spare time to serve
as student auditor, vice presi—
dent of his hall. and new pres-
ident of the senior class. His
scholastic ability has frequent-
ly placed. him on the Dean’s
List, and earned him the titles
Hermit and Friar. .

Steve is an economiis major,
but his thoughts are often tar
above those of his fellow stu-
dents—he plans to become a
jet pilot aster graduation from
advanced AFROTC.

It would have been well to
end with Coach Pfitsdh‘s re-
mark that Steve is “one of the
most intelligent players I've
ever coached," but co-captain
