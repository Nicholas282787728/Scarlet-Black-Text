At The Theaters

LILLAN ownN's MARIONET‘I‘ES

Pulling the wires for the marion-
ettes is not a iobyfor a politician. In
the lust place, those who manipulate
the puppets must he proressional area
tors just as proficient in the art or
acting as the members or any Broads
way cast. Besides, their lingers must
have the deitness and sensitiveness
at an expert musician. And their
other qualifications are such as are
not usually applied to politicians.

Each character in a puppet play
most have a separate actor to give
his speeches and guide his movements.
Tho result is that a puppet organiza-
tion has as many actors as the reign
ular play. The acting itselt, although
measured and deliherate to harmone
lze with the, somewhat mechanical
movements or the dolls, is the same
type or acting as is seen on the stage;
Unnatural tones of voice and ventrll~
ouulsm are strictly avoided.

The dolls range in size from eighr
teen inches to ‘three feet. They are
so intricately and delicately construe
ted that all parLs or their bodies, even
their eyes, move in the same way
that parts or the human body move,
Wires are attached to various parts
at their bodies. These wires are con—
trolled by actors hidden from View in
a loit especially constructed ahove
the miniature stage,

The scenic and lighting eflects or
the puppet stage, due to the miniature
size, are unusually effective and real-
istic. The tiny, .tl'nkllng, fairy-like
music is a delightful property or cv»
ery.marlonette production.

Lilian Owen's Marionettes, which
are being presented at the Colonial
Theatre on March 15, have the repu-
tation or being the best dolls in
America. Most of the scenes in her
production were designed by Michael
car-r, associate of Gordon Craig.
