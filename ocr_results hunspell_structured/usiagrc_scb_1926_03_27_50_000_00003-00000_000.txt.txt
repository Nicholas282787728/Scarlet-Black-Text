Major Cllilllgc for 19226 code,- It
lug Rule llrin Column-ill.

Four important changes in the play
mg code of football rules for 1926
were adapted by the Rules Committee
inst week, The changes mode are
prohnhiy more drastic than those
udopled at any of the annual meetings
during the last five years.

A new forwnrd pass rule states that
a team which makes on uncompleted
forward pass on the second or thud
downs will be penalized ﬁve yards.
The main intent of the rule is to curb
the wholesale passing employed by
losing teams in the ﬁnal minutes of
play- i

Under cnother.new rule, the team
having the safety scored upon it must
put the ball in play by kicking on the
ﬁrst down from its twenty.yard line.
the opposing teum lining up on the
thirtyaynrd line. The idea is to elimi-
nate the safely as n method of stalls
ihg. t

A third change involves the recovery
of balls that have rolled outside the
actual playing tel'ril‘to Under the
new ruling, a ball is dend which
crosses either side line, and the team
which had possession of the hell or
which touched it lost, is awarded the
ball. Thus the dangerous scrambling
for balls which have rolled/outside
will he eliminated.

The other change states that no
players who have run out of bounds
will be eligible to recover n fumble
on kickoff, or on in free kick after a'
fair catch. The rule is aimed at play'r
are who intentionally run out of
bounds to avoid contact with members ‘
of the receiving line.

The forwnrd pass rule is the only
one of the four which is receiving
m‘uch pro and con comment. Some of
the coaches fnvor the new rule and.
are of the opinion that it will speed
up the game. while others thinlu that[
the rule will seriously affect the scor— ‘
ing power of the teams. It. remnins toI
be seen whether the new rule will he'
successful or not in preventing
chance scoring in the last few minutes
of play.
