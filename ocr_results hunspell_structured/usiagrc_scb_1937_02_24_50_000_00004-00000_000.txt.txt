Gary Cooper says:

“It’s plain common sense for me to

prefer this light smoke”

"A little over a year ago I
changed to Luckies because 1 en-
joy the ﬂavor of their tobacco.
Ever since, my throat has been
in ﬁne shape. As my voice and
throat mean so much to me in my
business, it’s plain common sense
for me to prefer this light smoke.

So I’m strong for Luckies!”

they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they

personally prefer a light smoke.
Mr. Cooper veriﬁes the Wisdom of this prefere

ence, and so do‘ other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh
irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s
Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
