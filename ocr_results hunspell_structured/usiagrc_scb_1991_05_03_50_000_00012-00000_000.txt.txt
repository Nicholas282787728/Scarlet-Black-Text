a week, weather permitting, will
close outthe Grinnell College base-
ball season. The Pioneers played at
Coe on Wednesday, and plan to
u-avel to Illinois College on Satur-
day. and to host Knox in a post-
poned engagement Monday.

The three doubleheaders will
give the Grinnellians a chance to
improve on their records of 376 in
the Midwest Conference and 4,12
overall. Last week was a downer as
the Pioneers dropped five decisions
on the road. Monmouth took a pair
of wins, 8-2 and 19-6. Monday.
Over the weekend Monmouth won
again, lS-S, Knox fashioned a 4»O
shutout, and Illinois College pre-
vailed, 975.

In reviewing last Week's games,
Coach Greg Wallace pointed to a
good pitching performance by
David Shane who allowed only four
hits against Knox. The Pioneers
had mnners on base several times,
but could not come up with timely
hits.

"We can play these
teams ifwe play our
game. We have to cut
down an mistakes. "

--Coach Greg Wallace

Against Illinois College the
Grinnellians had 3-0 and 43 leads
but could not hold them. The
Blueboys broke up a 4—4 tie by
scoring four runs withouta hit.

Looking ahead to the season—
ending stand. Wallace said: “We
can play with these teams if we're
on om game. We have to cut down
on mistakes.”

some tough defensive exchanges,
Newton scored two Lrys and held
the lead for good.

The next game matched two of
