Floa’rs For Covo,

Clariﬁes Car Rule

The question of having in.
dividual hall decorations for
Homecoming was the principal
topic ot discussion this week
by the C of HP. The indecision
about the matter this year is
due to Convocation programs
which would restrict the build
ing of the decorations the night
before Homecoming as has been
done in the past. Final decision
on the matter is pending indie
vidual hall decisions made this
week.

The council also clariﬁed a
car rule technicality by stating
that when undcrclassmen drive
seniors’ cars the senior is re-
sponsible for the action and
will be liable to a ﬁne by the
C of HP.

in other, action this week, the
council lined a Langan junior
$10 for violation of the drinks
ing rule.

By Stair Reporter

The 5&3 yesterday con-

final judgment of the pro-
gram; this will be done at a
later date. A study of the men's
ﬁrst impressions will be con-
ducted next week.

Eighty-two per cent or the
women agree that broadening
the freshman circle or ac<

or prepping. However, onlyl

55% of the upperolasswomen

fulﬁlls this need.

new policies of preppin the

Questions dealing with the
enthusiasm shown in respect to
prepping indicate that the gen-
eral attitude has not changed
much since last year, Twenty
per cent of the women found
the overall picture to be en-
thusiastic.

ﬁfty-Ix per cent or the
upperclasswomen object to the
deletion or “dress-up" days
from the program. Fifty-eight
per cent miss the singing on
the bookstore steps. and 34%
the “goody” boxes. Many
freshmen would also like to
see these reinstated in the
program. There is little or no
objection to the addition or
hall raids and talent shows
or to the shortening oi the
program to a four-week pe-
riod.

As to the recently instituted
10:00-10:30 free time for preps,
it was found that 70% or the
upperclasswomen f a v o r this
