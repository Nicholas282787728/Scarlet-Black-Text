Pioneer Team
- to State Meet

All lowa Colleges invited
to Tourney at Ames

Saturday

All colleges and universities in the
state have been invited to compete
in the iowa state outdoor track
meet, to be held at Ames Saturday
afternoon.

Although only four teams partic
pated in the state indoor meet, it is
hoped that several ether lowa schools
will be entered this week end. it is
doubtful if other schools than Drake,
lowa State, University of lows and
Grihnell will enter full teams, but
outstanding performers from other
schools will undoubtedly be present,

Enters Same Team

Coach Lester Duke announced
yesterday that he would enter the
same team that competed last Sat-
urday against Drake, with the axe
ception of Joe Pfeiffer, who ran the
halfemile. He will be shifted to the
milerrlin. .

During the entire track season
co-Captain Harold Alexander has
been bothered with a pulled muscle
in his leg. received during the foot-
ball season, and in the meet Satur-
day he pulled a, muscle in his other
leg, so there is some doubt as to his
being able to run at Ames. He has
been given care, and in case his leg
recovers sufficiently he will be prac-
tically sure of winning at least two
second places at the meet,

Myron Pilbrow will be expected
to take his usual first place in the
two-mile run, while Wallace Grounds
is being relied upon to take points in
the hurdles, with James and Morgan,
being banked upon for counters in
the broad jump and shot put, re-
spectively

‘Ding’ Darling
Promises Aid

Swimming Plans Depend

on Return of Rosen

Prospects for a varsity swimming‘
team next year were greatly‘
strengthened Tuesday, when it was
announced by John c. Truesdale. di-
rector of athletics, that .7. N. “Ding”
Darling, Des Moines cartoonist and
trustee of the college, will again aid}
in financing the sport. l

Receipt of Mr. Darling's offer fol—
lowed the reappcrtionment Sunday,
by the student council, of next year's
semester fee receipts in order to pmr
vide a floating fund from which
swimming could be partly financed.

Rosen Undecided

Success of the project now depends
upon plans for the return nexL year
of Elton A. Rosen, swimming and
cross-country coach at Grinnell since
1930. Both the swimming and cross-
country teams have been undefeated
during the past school year.

Mr. Roscn was unable Tuesday to
announce his plans for next fall,

The floating fund established by
the student council is derived by re
ducing the allotments to music, lec-
ture course, hand, and the Women's
Athletic association in proportion to
the percentages they have formerly
received. Between 5350 and $400,
or four per cent of the total semes»
ter fee receipts, is thus available for
swimming. Details of the plan were
approved Monday by the faculty.

May Be Refundod

In case Coach Rosen does not re-
turn next fall, the floating fund will
either be refunded to the departs
ments from which it was cut, or be
distributed at the will of the coun-
cil at that time

A possibilty that a swimming team
would be organized upon an informal
ba‘ , if arrangements with Mr.
Rosen cannot be made, would depend
upon interest of the team members
and approval of the backcrs, accord—
ing to Mr. Truesdale

Psychology Class Conducts
Survey on ‘Black Cat'
Beliefs

Would you walk around a ladder?
Do you feel that breaking a mirror
means seven years had luck? Do you
feel that the number seven will bring
good luck? Would you carry a rabb-
it's foot for good luck? If not, there
are many Grinnell college students
who would

Yes, according to the results of
Prof. L, C. Douglass survey, college
students have their share of supeto
stitions. One hundred-twenty students
were asked by the psychology depart
ment to answer 50 such questions
recently and give their pcrsonal feel-
ings in regard.tc these old beliefs,

Three on a Match

Thirtyrseven said they would
carry a rabbit’s foot for good luck,
but 87 dcclarcd that they didn’t has
new it would do any good. Some of
the students who took the test were
undecided as to just where their feel-
ings s ood on many of the questions,
Lighting three cigorcts on one match
doesn't seem to bother many, as 92
said it wasn't unlucky.

Out of the 120, 75 said they would
venture to walk under a ladder, but
78 felt they must knock on wood if
they had been bragging. Even in this
time of depression, 11 think a $2 bill
is unlucky; just imagine!

 

Grinnell College Students Not immune
to Superstitions, Douglass Discovers!

Although 102 of the questioned stu-
dents have no qualms about taking1
the last piece of anything on a plate, .
several do believe in some of the old
superstitions concerning the weather
and the calendar. “Do you consider
Friday the Thirteenth as an unlucky‘
day?” received 42 yesses, while sev»
eral believe in ground-hog day and
are afraid to look at the new moon
over their left shoulders. Rain on
Easter Sunday still means rain on
seven consecutive Sundays for 25
Grinncll students.

Are college students superstitious?
The survey would seem to indicate
that most men and women attend-
ing higher institutions of learning
have a few private or pet supersti-
tiohs.

Thai Crazy Moon
If March comes in like a lion will
it go out like a lamb? Yes, said 55,
and 53 believe they will get their
wish if they blow out all the candles
on the birthday cake. Yet only two
think they would go crazy if they
slept in the moonlight, and only 13
believe that a blu- hg match \vlll'
bend in the direction in which the
girl friend, or boy friend, lives.
Prolcssor Douglass first had all of
his psychology students hand in lists
of all the superstitions they knew
