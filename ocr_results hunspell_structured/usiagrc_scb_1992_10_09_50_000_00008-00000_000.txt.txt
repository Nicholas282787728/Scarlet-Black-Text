Men's Soccer set
for Championship

by Alex Severens

This week may decide whetlter
the men’s soccer team will repeat as
Midwest Conference South Division
winners. The Pioneers are 6-0 in
league play and may be able to wrap
up the title this week. That will de-
pend, in part, on how the rest of the
conference plays, but primarily on
how well Grinnell fares with Cornell,
Coo and Illinois College.

Grinnell improved its conference
record with victories over Cornell
and Knox. Coach John Pﬁtsch was
not particularly pleased with the play
in the Cornell game, but was happy
with the 3-1 margin of victory. “We
were flat,” he said after the gamer
“Our second unit played almost the
entire second half, and it appeared
that as Cornell played better and bet-
ter, weplayed worse and worse.“ The
three Grinnell goals all came in the
first half, shots being put in by Bntno
Alicke,Sean Ramsey and ian Carlson.

The Pioneers came out and
played well from the start against
Knox. The team blistered out to a 2-
0 early lead on goals by Alicke and
Ramsey. The second halfpresettted a

challengcas seniorDoug Hodum was ‘

ejected from the game for a slide
tackle. Knox did score one goal

against the ten-man team, butPfitsclt ‘

felt that the team did well to play so
long without thetr defensive co»cap»
lain. Hodum willbesidelined for this
week‘s Cornell garneas well. For 18
minutes the team was forced to play
with only ten men.

“This is an exciting part of the
season," Pﬁtsch commented as his
team prepared for the big week.
“Probablyatthistimenexlwcekwe’ll
know who the division winner and
runnerrup are.” The championship
playoff, featuring two teams from
each division, will be held Oct. 31-
Nov. lat a South division sue.
