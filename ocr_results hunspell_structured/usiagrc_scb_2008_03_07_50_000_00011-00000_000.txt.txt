Sustaining the changes we talk about

This weekend creates an opportunity for less academic aspects of our lives at Grinnell to reflect our broader values

will be a chance to blow

given the events of the
past weeks, this party
should also be it t'llnc to
begin the changes that
we’ve spent the last
weeks dr. ussing,

But this year, instead of giggling. we can
all try to ape
preach each
person’s chi)»

an clement of
respect. The
party could be
a time to play
with gender, to
see what‘s ap—

have, and to see what elements ofthat cxpcrir
enee we can take into our daily, non-Mary B.
James lives.

In this scenario, each person can explmc
and question their own assumptions of gene
der and sexualitv—bccriusc for the night, we
suspend our expectations of “masculine" and
“felni nine" buliaviot.

Since the hate crimes of the past two
weeks, campus has been tilled with discusstons
of how to institutionalize change, and how to
"keep‘things going." We will not continue to
have dllrciunpus mlllcs and forums. When we
arrive back from Spring Break, campus life
may well return to “1ti as usual." It's up to us.
as students, to keep that from happening, and
to integrate these events into our daily lives,

What better place to start than a drunken,
crazy party?

There's no need spend the evening in cliv

tiqirc anti sanctimony. if we can live up to
the words. then orii goal is not to have “po-
liticallyrcorrccr" spaces in academic buildings
as opposed to fun spaces, like Harris, Rather,
our parties should be in sync with our ethical
prim ities.

Go to town, folks

The hate acts targeting members of our
community over t1 1: past two weeks have lieen
unsettling tos try the least. Thev have come to
symbol ire pro b’elms larger than themselves.

campus response to the homophobic vair
dalism and the 34 “hi motivawrl"lettets has
shown an inspiring degree of support from

Neutral boxes

The staff of Mail Services shaics in the
concern and upset aboutlastweek’s incidentof
hate mail. Our hearts go out to those who were
targeted. We wish to support everyone during
this healing process.

\Vc’ve noticed that some students have
taped various items (pictures or words) to
their mailbox doors. it’s very heaitening to see
members of the campus community express
these acts ofsupporr We in the mailroom can
not always indge which messages express sup
port and which do not. If we knew that all
items posted were 1ppropriate and supportive,
we would have no concern. But messages can
be difficult to judge.

In keeping with our long-standing policy,
we are asking that campus members post noth-
ing on the mallbox doors. For now, we feel the
best thing is to keep the mailboxes as neutial
as possible. We appreciate your understanding.
We encourage campus members to post mes
sages ofsiipport on the bulletin boards located
the length ofthe mailtooin lobby. The boards
are maintained by the Office of student Af-
fairs, individuals from this office, members of
SGA, and others have been collaborating on
Hate-Free pins and campusewide signage to
show support ofthosc targeted last week.

Again, our hearts go out to those who have
been targeted by these disparaging messages.

grime/Mail rewrites

Support mail

The sight of mailboxes over the weekend
covered in pictures of rainbows was a pow-
erful image of support for the queer coins
munity. Considering that the mailroom was
the scene of the most recent hate crime, this
show of support by individuals who chose to
place a rainbow on their mailboxes served to
affirm and restore the inailioom’s status as a
safe space. But by Monday morning each rain-
bow had been removed, leaving no tntee ofthe
spontaneous aetion.Mail services has said that
they were removed in order to preserve the
“neutrality" of the mailtoom. By taking this
position, however. they have. validated the idea
that homophobia is a reasonable idea to hold,
and that it would be inappropriate for the
mailroom to chose between hate or support
fat the queer community.

I do not doubt the sympathy of mailroom
employees. As has been mentioned many times
in the past two weeks. though. sympathy does
not necessarily translate into action. The \er
dividuals that displayed their support on their
mailboxes sent one message. The removal of
these displays sent another While this second

action has been defended in the name of fair»
ness, neutrality, oi openness for all viewpoints,
there are, and should be,lrmrts what this open-
ness means at Grinnell. Simply prrt, there
should be no space on campus where hare and
homophobia are accepted, tacitly or openly, as
valid ideas This does not mean wt: close our
selves off to the people who hold those views,
but rather that we recognize as individuals, as
a community. and as an institution that they
are uninformed and damaging views held by
people who have the capacity to ch ige,

J.Grae show

When I hopped off the stage after "dank
ing” aiound with “Jean Grae" (Tsidi Ibrahim)
following Saturday’s Harris concert, I don't
thinkl have ever left a musical performance at
Grinnell more disappointed.

While 1 enioy rap and hip hop music, I
would never call myself .1 “"head or claim to
have memorized all the lyrics to some B1 de
Dead Prez cut. I can mime rill the members
of NWA, but have no profound insight into
the vaiious cultural and racial issues that come
up in most academic conveisations about hip
hop.

What I do fecl comfortable saying, as
someone who has “performed" to audiences
outside ofmy comfort zone (beatboxing torso
behavioral disturbed youth, teaching neuroscir
ence to 10 Iowa inmates, and juggling for 15
Tamil Families in a South Indian countiy club)
is that berating, patronlzmg, and espousing
intellectual and cultural superiority over your
audience is not the way to create a succcssl‘ul
performance space

I went to the concert with high cxpccm-
tions, and undcistandably so,.l\’ls. Ibrahim is
an ci ccc known to break down traditional
paradigms ofhip hop and really says some pmr
found stuff. Council is a pretty understanding
and forgiving community—going on an hour
late is not out of the oidinary and we all know
technical drfhcultres can be mortifying

This stated, the manner in which Ms, Ibras
him dealt with thc situation not only made her
look foolish and ungrateful for the 58,000¢
she was paid to perform, but was directly ine
suiting to those in attendance and created an
atmosphere ofcontcmpt and lggrcssion that is
completely hypocritical to any one who wishes
to breakdown some ofihe negative stereotypes
about hip hop.

\lVlulc alcohol may have inﬂuenced Ms
Ibrzihun’s (31), behavior, she spent iriost ofhcr

me 1) dissing people‘s dance moves 2) tell—
- , as she rapped
along with her own songs through iTunes 3)

extensive. repetitive swearing, and finally, about
40% of her show conSisted of 4) “hilaiious”
commentary about the poor lyrical content of
past hip hop songs. She did not comment on
the political or cultural issues I imagine Jeor
pie involved in Hip Hop Evolved hopedl she
would illuminate in her performance. instead
she commented on whvxrappersrapwas ter-
rible/larne/worthy oftrashing for pure stylistic
reasons Ms Ibrahim latci stated during the
seven song set that the lyrics and music of a
song aren't necessarily of direct importance,
and that a song's ultimate worth comes from
about how it makes you feel—0K, Tsidi, you
make us feel upset and unappieciated.

At several points Ms. lbrahirn told concert
goers in the front row to leave or move ifthey
weren’t going to get “into" her music. And later
she quizzed them all on their favorite hip hop
records, searching, of course, for that obscure
street cred tefcience). Later she spent five
minutes bashing one student for not dancing
well cnouoli.

If it's not clear yet, Saturday night Ms
Iblahim let a lot of18-23 year olds down .I'm
sure she could be a wonderful performer and
talented lyiicist but she truly shamed herself
this weekend.

During these tough times around campus,
the last thing we need is someone telling us,
the people who paid her thousands of dollars,
why we do not deserve to be in her presence.

What Ms. Ibrahim missed (and what I
tried to explain to her) was that in oider to
create a successful community to perform in,
she needed to help us,cncourage us, and excite
its, about her art and why she was worthy of
our Saturday night. Instead she spat remarks
like “lfl turn around and everyones fist rsnt
in the mothei fuckin aii, well tiy it again until
we get it right."

I know many members ofour community
worked incredibly hard to set this show up ,
To have someone disrespect us, so blatantly, is
unacceptable.

If Saturday night is what an 88,000+ show
at Grinnell is about. I'm concerned, To add
to the absurdity, at best, 150 people showed
up for the show, that's an expensive ticket for
seven very mediocre songs. I feel that the per--
formance further notes thatwe should stick to
bringing artists who understand how much we
appreciate talented performers, but apprccrarc
how much work goes into getting them to a
small town.They must comprehend that for us
to cute about them, their music, and their ines-
sage, they must at least to show us the respect
we humbly desctve.

At the cnd of her show, scnsiiiu tht: [CUT

Kweli [fellow rapper and owner of her label,
Blacksmith], lll get fiied. You may not get

fired, Ms. Ibrahim, but I don't think you’re in—

SGA finances

Between Harris parties. internship searchr
es, and midrsemestcr papers, most students
haven't taken a particular interest in SGA ﬁr
nanees. outside ofrequesting funds for a stu—
dent gioup oi applying for money to bring a
speaker to campus, many students know rela-
tively little about how SGA’s budget is strucr
tilted or used. \Nhat ifsomconc told van that
SGA had a slush fund with over $24,000 in
it?

To clarify, ‘slush fund'was the term associ-
ated with this account two years ago when the
588 first reported the fund's CXlSKBI‘CE’fl‘iE
account’s actual name is the ‘fund balanccf
Every year. students pay an activity fee (8170)
along wrth their tuition that is split 2:1 be-
tween SGA and SPARC, The 2/3 allocated
to SGA is spent on student groups, concerts,
films, Harris parties, etc. While SGA attempts
to spend the entire budget every s nester, even
over-allocating funds, some remainder usually
goes unspent. In the Fall, these funds roll over
into the Spring budget. After the Spiing se-
incstcr,sincc rollover does not transfer between
academic years, SGA deposits these funds into
the fund balance.

But what happens if no money is left over
at the end of the year, or if more dollais are
spent than were initially allocated? Though
SGA usually underspends. there is the occar
sionril semester where students and student
groups spend 1 larger percentage of their alt
locations than expected. In this case, SGA
coveis the differcnce with funds from the fund
balance. Despite this, the fund balance has
increased over time, with rollover averaging
several thousands of dollars per year. 0v r the
years, the existence of this fund has in ated
conversation both inside and outside of SGA
in an attempt to answer the question. what
should become of this account?

This fund comprised of student funds
accumulated over the years. it is in the interest
of all of us as a student body to determine an
effective method with which to manage this
fund, We hope that this article will provoke
