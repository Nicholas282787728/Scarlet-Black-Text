AGAIN THE CURTAIN RISES.

Today We sit chewing the editorial pcn reflectively,
hoping and plsnning that the SCARLET AND BLACK
may this year better ﬁll its functions on and off the
Crinnsll campus than ever before. We realize that
being human,we snoll probably make mistakes and will be
righteously cursed by many and sundry equally human
beings during the next few months. Neverthelessi

It shall be our aim to fulﬁll the two primary func-
tions of this publication this year in ss constructive a
way as possible, while we constantly keep in mind that
the SCARLET AND BLACK is a student paper estab-
lished to record and interpret student life and thought.
These two functions arc. to our mind: First, to print an
accurste, complete and unbiased account of Grinnell coir
lege life from day to day; Second, to interpret accur-
I ntely, but if need be frankly and fearlessly through our
editorial columns What Crinnell students one thinking
and doing. Each of these requires a little explanation

First~The dissemination of news, it shell be our
aim to make this publication beter ionrnnlisticsily, to
give the most important news the best space, to keep

our columns open to any comment. the students or foc-
ulty may desire to make and ﬁnally, to print all the
news necessary to give the whole truth of an event.

lournnlistically, we shall endcnvor to write the news
in the most appealing way possible, paying strict atten»
tion to such important details as grammar and spelling
employed. Each organization will be given its propor-
tional amount of space in the columns of this publication,
and if the acti es of some are stressed more than those
of others, it will only be because of the wider appeal
of the former.

Two agencies will be continued from former years
for the expression of opinion, one the “What Do You
Think?” column, to which we particularly invite centric
butions from all those disagreeing with us or anybody,
and the other the "Campus Opinicn” column, to whose
contributors we urge more careful consideration of the
question being asked each time. Finally, the SCARLET
AND BLACK will print the news accurately, as far as
possible. If news is sensational, it will be presented us
it occurred, without any embellishing details. On these
policies we propose to mould the quality of our news for
this year.

As in the dissemination, so in the interpretation of
news we shall try to do accurate work. But an editorial
policy requires more than accuracy—it needs to be con»
structive, while yet frankly representing student opinion.
We shall endeavor to make our interpretation of move-
ments and tendencies on the campus one which will
not only stimulate thought among the students, but
reflect a thinking student body to the outside world.

Changes we Shall certainly recommend if they seem

'Wise, but it is our belief that changes consisting in the

throwing off of too-old trsditions should come slowly.
For example, the SCARLET AND BLACK strongly
favors the granting of a very liberal out system to
juniors and seniors snd the adoption of the principle
that more capable students should be allowed to advance
in their work faster than average students, but we would
not suggest the application of these ideas to more than a
few at ﬁrst.

We shall strive to uphold in our editorial columns
such worthy traditions as chapel and Vespers—and it
shall be our concern in the near future to try to discover
means of remedying the present low attendance at these
two services. Believing that the modern student should
follow the afsfirs cf the world, our editorials will often
deal with outstanding international problems and prob
lems of our own nation. Finally, our editorial policy
will be one which will give Sympathetic consideration
to both the viewpoint of faculty and students.

Thus another policy is inaugurated for the SCAR—
LET AND BLACK, one in accord with the editorial
policy adopted by the staff of this paper last spring.
Already we can see many smiling cynicslly st this pa-
rsdc of ideals. Already we can visualize the derogatory
opinions bound to come our way this year from time to
time. We hope 'that both the cynics and critics will
approach in and frankly indicate what is wrong and
where. Only in such a manner can we conscientiously
strive to apply to this paper the ideals set forth in this
editorial.

Wittler Publishes
Handwriting Study

The theory that handwriting is an
index to intelligence is discredited by
Prof. Milton Wittler in an article on
"Factors Affecting Ability in Hand»
writln which appears in a recent is-
sue of School and Society. Professor
wittler. who is chairman of the edu-
cation dcpartment at Crinnell college.
bases his conclusions upon is. study
which he has made of specimens of
the handwriting of 550 children in the
public schools of a Boston suburb.

Dr, Wittlcr found that children
above the average in intelligence
wrote more rapidly but not more leg-
ibly than those of lower intellectual
rsnk. He also found that learning to
write is a matter of muscular control,
related more closcl to learning to
draw than to scqu ing skill in the
standard academic subjects.

Miriam Boozer, during a week—
end visit at her home in Ames, will
attend the Ames-Grinnell football
game.

the visit and the method of trans-
portation have not been deﬁnitely
decided, but Miriam Speulding and
James Morrison have been appoint-
ed to investigate possibilities and
report to the class.

genuinely interested in an organiza-
tion to stimulate creative Writing by
constructive and Comparative criti-
cism, may submit manuscripts for
consideration. These manuscripts
will be necessary for acceptance,
Manuscripts should be handed as
soon as possible to Helen Kingery or
Robert Swift.

Other steps for reorganization
passed at the meeting include provis-
ions that all club manuscripts be
read anonymously by rcsders ep-
pointed for each meeting, and be dis-
cussed anonymously, and that each
meeting be devoted to the reading
and consideration of one kind of
writing only. Dinner-meetings will
be sponsored at certain specified
times at which faculty members or
others interested will be asked to
speak on subject pertinent to the
purpose of the club.

At the first meeting of the Y. M.
c. A. for this year held Thursday
evening in the sssocinticns building,
Donald Brodinc introduced the plan
for the current year. The adopted
plan considers life in four parts:
work, play, love and worship. Three
meetings will be devoted to the dis—
cussion of each port. Success, a
phase of work, was discussed in open
forum under the leadership of Lewis
Trcyer. Meetings are held in the
associations building at seven
o'clock every Thursday evening to
which all are welcome.
