20 Novem r 1992

by Riva Sharples

The time has come for Grinnell Coir
lege snidents to stop the endless stream of
accusations and assaults made each week
on theopinion page of the ScarletdtBlack.
Rather than continually passing the blame
for racism from one racial group to an-
other, we should instead beuniting to take
action against it. Hiding behind a smoke

rather the true issue is reniovutg racism
from society and teaching funire genera-
tions to judge people based 0 inner qualir
lies, not superﬁcial eharacter' ’cs like skin
color or physical appearance.

It is easier to attack well-known lead-
ers than to provide solid reasons for a racist
altitude. Malcom X, the vIctirn-of-choice
onlastweek'sopuuonpage[seewzehbum,
Nov. 13], was and remains an inspiration
to many in the civil rights movement.
Overcoming a life of drugrdcaling and
pimping, Malcolm X reversed the mega
tivedircctionofhis life after hewas thrown
in prison, by educating himself with books
and newspapers. In the Autobiography of
Malcolm X, he faces and acknowledges

Fight the real problem, stop the accusations

his own racism toward white people, a
prejudice irtgraincd in him by the assault
and murder of his father by a group of
unidentiﬁed men, a life of fear andpoverly
in the ghetto, and ignorance.

In chapter 19 of his autobiography,
Maloolmeays.“I don’tspeakagainst the
sincere, wellrmeaning, good white people.
I have learned that there are some, I have
learned thatnotallwhitepeoplearcracists.
i am speaking against and my fight is
against the white racism " In 1965, the
year of his assassination, Malcolm X had

reached the conclusion that the white man
was not inherently evil as he had once
believed, but that American society advo-
catcd and promoted racial attitudes which
made the acknowledgment of and ﬁght
against racism extremely difﬁcult.
Malcolm X believed in action. In-
stead ofbeing trampled upon by themajor-
ity while waiting for laws of equality and
fairness to develop in the system, he urged
people to stand up for their rights, Just as
a parent teaches a child to defend himself
and to not be pushed around by odrcrs,

As leaders of tomorrow, we must

on campus, This includes challenging

should see beyond the name-calling and
superﬁcial accusations made previous is,

at hand: stopping racism and discrimina-

Here at Grinnell College. in a place
where hundreds of intelligent minds have
gathered, students have a greatpoleniial to
make a difference in the world. If we can't
see through to the real problem and over-
come our own racism, how can we ever
expect others to change?

To the editor:

I expect that many people on this
campus may be growing weary of the
countless letters which have been written
to thisnewspaperaboutMikeWashbum’s
column, and of his continual insulting
remarks about the intelligence and wrtt-
ing ability ofhis critics However, that is
why i have written this letter,
