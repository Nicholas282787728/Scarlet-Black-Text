£53,211"ng in number that‘nny court that next takes

up this issue will undoubtedly look very
closely at what the lowa Supreme Court has done." said Unir
versiry of lowa Law Professor Todd Pettys. “The fact that the
Iowa Supreme Court’s chlSlOn was unanimous will underscore
the importance of the decision for other courts."

Barry Marsumoto, also a Law Professor at University orlowa,
said the Court decision might also shape public opinion by legitir
mating the issue or samcescr marriage in the pubhc conscious
nesS.“The state Supreme Court [decision] vn‘ll resolve in the state
oflowa thinking more about thc ptopr'icty ofhanning same-Sex
marriage," Matsumoto said, “and for those who oppose [it], per»
haps changing their minds. It scems to bc that we've been given a
wonderful chance to drink about this question and how we want
to treat people in the state oflowa.”

Political action on the issue even preceded the Court’s ant
nounccment. With The Court's decision pending, legislators subr
mittcd two proposals in the House to change marriage laws in
Iovm. On April 3, State chs. Dolores Mertz DrOttoscn and
Dwayne Alons RrHull introduced a bill to amend the state eons
stitution deﬁning marriage as only between a man and a woman.
That bill was in response to a proposal by State Sen. Matt Mc-
Coy DrDes Moines that same day seeking to make the state's
marriage laws gender neutral. Neither proposal is expected to
make it out of committee in time for the current session.

Proposed amendments would likely not be passed until 2012,
at the earliest, The amendment process for Iowa constitution is
unusually long, requiring that a proposed amendment be passed
by consecutive legislatures before being submitted to the people
for a vote. currently, the state democmts have a 5644 majority in
the House and 32718 advantage in the Senate.

Republican leaders quickly expressed disappointment at the
decision and frustration at supposed duplicity on the part of
state democrats, State Senate Minority Leader Paul McKinley,
R’Ch‘dﬁmn rebuked democrats for obstructing efforts at initiate
ing the amendment process, singling out Senate Majority Lender
Mike Gronstal D-council Bluﬁ’s who said Monday April is that
he had no intention oftaking up the amendment issue.

“Those democrats who indicated they believe marriage is her
tween one man and one woman when this was being debated
in previous years, they have not taken this up," McKinley said.
“Their excuse for not doing this earlier was we didn’t need to do
it, we had a law, the Defense of Marriage Act, In the event the
supreme Court ruled otherwise, they promised they would bring
this up. And now they're rctusing."

McKinley was referring to the 1993 law deﬁning marriage in
the state as only between a man and a woman, a law that Gronstal
voted for,

McKinley said that the discrepancy between past legislative
action and the recent Court decision demanded resoluion by a
vote of the people. "We have two branches or government, the
legislative and the executive, saying one thing. we have seven jus-
ticcs saying a difrerent thing," McKinley said. “I beheve we need

to do what any reasonable person would expect and say let's take
it to the people aflownsThC people oflowa nccd to have a vote.
It’s their turn, they’re The final arbiters and they should have a
sa .

yMembers of the democratic leadership could not be reached
in time for comment.

It’s unclear whether or not a later constitutional amendment
would invalidate marriages performed in the interim, Petrys said.

Field, however, said the logistical issues of not recognizing
the marriages could potentially compel other states to address the
marriages in a way that validated them.

“My advice would be get married as soon as possible. They
can't possibly throw out the marriage. Places are going to have
to think about people who are marricd in other places anyway,"
Field said. "For one thing, you'd have to decide itrliey break up
whether they have to get divorced or not. or ithey marry seine-
body else, whether they're committing bigamy.”

lowa marriage laws do not include a residency requirement
which means that same-Sex couples from other States may legally
marry here.

Cheryl FleeneTrSeymour, who works in the College’s Chapr
lain's Office and helps manage wedding reservations at Herrick
Chapel, said that office might expect an increased number of
wedding inquiries in response to the recent court decision. She
Said the ofﬁce had received some reservations in the last few days
but that none of the callers have indicated whether they were
responding directly to the ruling.

“Our language is sct up so that as gender neutral,” Fleenr
er-Seymour said “So when we send out our wedding packets, it
doesn't say the bride and the groom,'it says the wedding coupler”

l-lerrick Chapel isn't the only way for couples to many at the
College. Randy Brush, husband of Loosehead RLC and Assis-
tant Director of Residence Life Kim Hinds-Brush, became an
ordained minister in June 2006 using an onljne service and said
he was looking forward to potentially marrying same-sex couples
among his friends.

“It was one of Those things where I did it because we were sits
ting around talking about how ridiculous it was that you could get
ordained online,"Brush said. “But over one orthose things ifthey
ever legalized gay marriage in Iowa it would be nice if] could do
that for my friends but there was never anyone in particular.

“A lot orpeople on Plans have said ‘ifl‘m ever up ror it, you're
the man,'ltsomeone asked me to, in be more than happy to," he
said

In the meantime, while Richardson said dlat he was some-
what optimistic about what the ruling could mean for the tuture
ofsamcescx marriage and gay rights, he would rather relish the
moment “1 think it does have amazing consequences for the rest
of the U.S.I think that onc of the reasons that Vermont passed it
right after this is because they felt like they had to jump on the
bandwagon also,” he said,

“So I Think There are a lot ofways in which it's really good. But
right nowI prefer to just celebrate."
