Love at Grinnel: Sex ecountryide

Last weeks the SSE featured an article on “Grins
nell Dating through the Years." At ﬁrst glance, my
heart skipped a beat. Grinnell dates for years, develops
a meaningful relarionship, and overcomes its profound
fear of commitment to someone outside the island com,
munity of its brain, all the while juggling a heavy course
load, aireetlng positive social change and bearing the
burden otan endowment that honestly gives it a right to
be picky? As I read more carefully, it nirned out this was
all in my head. Like u two page spread reeriling a carn-
pus’ past romance,I might have been overcolnpensating
for something.

Februaryis as February doeslr is a slow news month,
for example, current events cannot keep up with the col-
umnist's wit. on the bright side, February is a good time
to look around and reﬂect, not only on ourselves, but on
how other people see us. What makes us littmctive to
other people? How do we as a student body buddy up?
February is the month ofonline dating personality tests.
When everything on the horizon is gray and looks like
homework, the rosy rim is up to us. Our hearts and hora
modes have ro gel erearive.We make our own news. We
are the news.

In February, we have die time and space to ask our
selves things like, if Carrie Bradshaw lived in rural Iowa
academia, what would she write about? Or better, what

would happen lftliey made a HBO sitcom or my love

erat’ted behets, our passion and potential for

100 days was not too long ago. It is
not a coincidence that this party happens
in February Although the opportunity
to suck face wirh your entire ruroe
rilll class seems a little out of the
ordinary, 100 Days operates not
too dle'erendy from anything else
at Grinnell. Like Plans, it provides
a public forum and a good excuse.
Maybe ifyou post veiled song lyrics,
poetry, parables for your crush on your l>lan,yetrr cmslt
will get it and something will happen

Maybe ifyou make out with your crush in a crowd in
the pub in the dark, your enlsh will get it and something
\vlll happen. Certainly while you are waiting for some-

thing to happen, you can watch everyone else and make
your own judgments. Certainly you are not doing your
reading, and plus you are making out with other people.
It' you are an underclassmnn and still counting down
the days, rhere are other things to do and see The
Vagina Monologues are informative and enjoyable
for both sexes and they are performed in February.
While they are not vagina Panel Discussions and
might seem a little onersided to some. that is not
the point.

The point ls maybe your crush wril be
there and get that you are sensitive and some-
thing will happen, like later when maybe
you are both at Harris. Then there is
\ Valentine's Day; make use ofeame
pus mail. And the Undenvear Ball;
make use oflligllt vision. And on
thefacebookeom it is Fcbmary all

year round.
This February has been unsea-
sonably wtu'm. something is in the
air; you can look closely and decide lor- yourseltrvherher
it is love or global warming. In the meantime, maybe
winter will turn into spring and then something will

happen.
