Representativ—e of Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Speaks on Na
ﬁonal Capital.

CLAIMS WASHINGTON MOST
BEAUTIFUL CAPITAL CITY

Relates Interesting Historical In-
cidents Connected with Places
Discussed.

E. J. Gleason. lecturer on the city
of Washington, was greeted by a well
filled house when he delivered an ilr
llustrnted tail: on the city of \Vfishr
ington and the beauty spots surround-
ing the capital. Mr. Gleasou is a rep-
resentative of tile Baltimore and
Ohio railroad who is endeavorng to
arouse an interest in the attl'ftctions‘
of Washington and Consequently SPI

'curo a greater traffic oevr the 13 and
0 lines. His lecture. however, was our
tirely devoid of of any advertising
material and was devoted entirely to
describing the places of interest which
would be seen on a. trip f1o1n Chloe:
go to Washington and vicinity Aside
from a. business standpoint the speak—
er stated that his puipose was to in-
still an interest in Washington which
he claimed is the most beautiful MD-
ital in the World.

The colored slides used to illustrate
the: talk were some of the finest ever
seen in Grinnell, being‘of an artistic
value which made them .1 decided
contrast to the ordinary lecturer's
slides. The pictures were excellently
handled Without a hitch ,in the en-
tire program
