A pair of story beak finishes featured
the Missouri Valley football program
last weekend, as final period rallies
gave Creighton and Oklahoma Aggies
wins over Gn‘nnell and Detroit re-
spectively. While the latter, being
a non—conference tilt, would have
made no difference in the struggle
for the loop title, even though the Liar
vision had been reversed, theJay-PioV
neei- tusslc threatened to throw the
league light into a virtual free-for.all
as the Grillnellians led ithl he final
lhree minutes of the game.

The Cowboys 19-6 victory over De.
troit was even more unexpected Lhana
Grinnell win over Creighton would
have been, Trailing until the waning
minutes of the fray, the Aggies turned
the tide when they gained a 7-6 ad.
vantage early in the last quarter. In
a desperate cfiort to regain the lead
the Titans began to pass, and it was
mainly through interceptions that the
Cowboys gained their last two touch—
clowns.

Jays on Top

Tho Bluejays remained at the top
of the Valley heap by means of their
Victory over the Pioneers. Drake is
the only hurdle left between the days
and their .first confercncc grid title,
but that obstacle may prove to be
a stumbling block.

The Bulldogs entertained a home—
coming crowd Saturday by trouncing,
20 to 7 the same Haskell Indian out-
fit which had earlier gained narrow
decisions over both Creighton and
Gl‘innell . With wins over Grinnell
and the Indians in their last two
contcss the Drake gridders seem to
have hit their stride and may force
the hopeful Jays to Share their title
with the Oklahoma Aggies, though
they defeated the Cowboys two week—
ends ago.

Washington Wins

In the other two games which saw
Valley teams in action last weekend,
Hie powerful Washington eleven walr
lopcd Butler, recently divorced from
the conference, 32 to 7, while Wash-
bui-n made a surprising stand against
the strong Kansas Aggie team before
losing 14 to 5.

Both the east and west will get a
look at Missouri Valley football next
weekend as Drake travels to Denver,
C010,. to meet Denver university and
the pklahoma Aggie: rount to Pitts—
burg, Pa, to battle Duquesne. OLher
Valley games are: Tulsa vs. Centenary
st Tulsa, Okla; Grinnell vs, Iowa 5‘:
Teachers at Cedar Fal ' Washington
va Kansas at St. Louis, Mo; and
Washburn vs. Gonzaga at Topeka,
Kan. All but the latter are Saturday

‘Truth Serum’ Used
in Testing Criminals

MADlSON, Wis, (ACP)—Exlen_
sivc research in the effects of the
"truth serum" on human beings is
being conducted here by Dr. William
in Lorenz, University of Wisconsin
psychiatrist.

Employing suspects in a recent
criminal case here, Dr. Lorenz inject—
ed the serum intmvcnously and at—
tended the examination extending over
three hours. He said the potion pro.
duces a semi.conscious state in which
the patient makes direct answers to
questions without first considering
what his replies will be,

immediately upon innoculation, the
patient becomes unconscious. He then
has to be aroused by talking, touching
and the application of cold cloths
Dr. liorenz asserts that the patients
may be given another serum which
will aid in bringing him to a state
in which he will carry on free conver—
sation.

Tutors to Oppose
Pioneers Saturday

struction in this fundamental. This
lack of clean, hard blocking may be
cited as partially responsible for Grin.
nell’s string of defeats, although there
are many other factors to consider,
including a pitiful lack of reservcsa
the entire squad numbering 23—and a
series of injuries which have contin-
ually riddled starting lineups

Bob Morgan, 215 pound tackle, is
again the victim of one of these injure
ies and will be unable to play against
the Tutors Saturday. After- recover~
ing from a fracture of his left thum'
suffered a month ago, Morgan broke
the same bone last week, just above
the former fracture.

Fini Back

To counteract this loss, the Pioneers
will again have the services of Vic
Fini, driving back, absent from the
lineup since the Michigan State game

Coach Watt is not planning to start
the Colorado lad, however, because
of the possibility oi injury to his
shoulder, but will insert him into the
game as either a reserve quarterback
or fullback.

Bob “Scotty” McLeod, sophomore
halfback, is recovering from his at.
tack of flu this week and is expected
to be in shape Saturday. Bill McFar-
lin, reserve quarterback, may not be
able to play because of a wrenehcd
shoulder.

In the line, the change necessitated
by Morgan’s absence will probably
place Floyd Horton at either guard or
tackle. At the other guard position
will be Bernie Trumbull, stellar red
head, while Bob Sutton, Butch Meeter
and Berger Graves will be depended
on at the tackle posts. ,

The early report from Omaha Satur-

over for the score.
