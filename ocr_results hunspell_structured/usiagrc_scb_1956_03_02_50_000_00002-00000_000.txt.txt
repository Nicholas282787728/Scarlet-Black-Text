This is definitely undesirable.

Council convention is analagous to national political

convention, it is possible for a national convention to draft

someone as its nominee. However, _the drafter

To the Editor:

No college student is sure
prised to hear his college presir
dent or a member of the Board
of‘Trustees indulge in some old
fashioned backslapping. But
when outsiders praise the work
of Grinnell college, I feel that
it should come to the notice
of all connected with the Cole
lege.

. What follows is a reprint of

an editorial which appeared in
the Sunday (February 19,
1956) issue of the st. Louis
Globe-Democrat. While it does
not make mention of the stu—
dent body, it commends the
college for its dealingwith
the problem of faculty salaries,
and certainly better; faculty
condi 'ons. will affect student
conditions _ at least academic
any speaking:

“Grinnell college, in the little
lowa city of the same name,
has decided what it will do
with its $474,000 grant from the

Ford foundation. Its Board of ‘ ' '

Trustees has decided to earmark
all of the money to raise faculty
salaries.

“And then, not to be outdone,
they have decided to try and
match the Ford grant by His

'ing a like sum by their own
efforts. It, too, will go into the
payrchecks of the college {ac-
ulty.

”Grinnell’s decision was not
prompted by its past neglect
oi the teaching statf. 0n the
contrary, salaries there are
above average"

Although i have been away
from the campus only a short
while, others have spoken to
me about the college in oue

To the Edit/Dr:

The power of the printed word
must never be used with
the alarming lax! y which char-
acterized the unqualified
attack on the Gn'nnell college
faculty by reader Jean Tieder
mano. To state that professors
tolerate dishonesty from certain
groups of students is a serious
matter.

Faculty toleration of student
dishonesty * remains non»
existent . . . Emphasis is on . . .
development of an intelligent
wellrrounded citi‘zen same
policy which is enrorced i-n treat-
ing all rases of . . . dishonesty.

The net result of this policy
indicates no favored stu-
dents . . . on the omer hand, it
would be short—sighted to say
that the student is not encourag-
ed to distinguish himself at
Grrnnell.

Finally, in regard to the refe
ei-ence where two students . . .
received djﬁferent punishmem
entirely different conditions
were involved.

Perhaps if we would spend
more time in actually becoming
Phi Beta Kappa's and better ath-
letes, while being grateful for
such an excellent faculty
we would have fewer cases of
dishonesty and , . (suspicion,

way or another. Go ahead with
student reform movements — it
gives student organizations some-
thing to do and upon occasions
something good comes of it, but
let’s also be appreciative of the
progress that is being made at ,
the moment. Certainly, Grin-
iicll college has found its place

on the map.

in view of that purpose. Cone
sequently, they were unable to
question the candidates in a
manner which would reveal the
various candidates triie con-
cepts of student Council and
student government and their
possible talents for succeeding
in those concepts. And those
students that came to the meet-
ing on Wednesday were assum-
ingly those with a real interest
in student government!

The important problem of
communication between the
Council and the students was
brought up at this meeting, and,
although this problem is far
from 'sulved, again there seemed
to be no knowledge of the
attempts of this year’s Council
at correcting it.

First there are the reports
mode by the hall representa-
tives. To assist them in their
report, they were given each
week a cbndensed version of
the Council minutes which
were also posted on hail bulle»
tin boards. A more lengthy re-
port was put up each week
in first ﬂoor of Ami. Week-
ly there were two columns con-
cerning' Council news in the
Scarlet and Black; the Council
Corner and the straight news
report in addition to special
articla. Council information
was even aired over KGRW a
couple of times.

In the other direction,
dents-are urged to use their
hall representative as the chan-
nel for complaints or sugges-
tions. We have publicized the
tact that all council meetings

_ are open and any student or stu—

dents are welcome to state their
position in person. We have
continually requested student
views by letters to the editor

or letters sent to the Council,

itself.
In short, there has been ade-

quote publicity of the «lam
cirs work, but we still have
our problem. Communication
is a concern of all branches of
student government and re.
cently both the o of HP and
League Board have taken
steps toward alleviating their
relationship to the problem.
While 1 realize that there are
undoubtedly more and better
ideas for communication yet to]
be tried, I believe that the prob-i
lem will never be satisfactorily
solved until the Grinnell stu-
dent decides to do his part and
cooperate in achieving com-
munication.
