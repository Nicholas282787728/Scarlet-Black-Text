Soccer is probably the oldest spurt
» known today. Forms or soccer were
played in China as early as 3,000 3.0.
Yet, in the United States, soccer is
relatively new. It wasn't until the 20th
~ . century that soccer became a formal
part of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA), and only then did
the U S, compete both intercollegiate
- ly and internationally. It is no wonder
' that Grinnell women's soccer is non-
existent,
_ But times are changing. There are
' currently enough interested women
athletes to form the Women’s Soccer
Club, and it will become a formal entic
ty next semester. The hope or the
women athletes is that some day soc-
cer will receive complete team status;
but until then, women's soccer

receives only club status, The con-
straints set on team stotus originate
from the National Association of Inter-
collegiate Athletics for Women
(NAIAWi which excludes soccer from
its program (just as the NCAA ex»
eludes rugby). It was proposed in May.
at the last meeting of the NAIAW, that
soccer be offered in the spring instead
of soitball. The conference didn’t ac-
cept the proposal due to what it. felt
was a lack or interest in the sport.
Merry Ormsby, Grinnell’s current
athletic coordinator, believes that soc-
cer could be offered in the spring in
addition to softball and track Currentc
ly, there are only two women’s sports
in the spring as compared to tour in
the fall. Ormsby says she is
“enthusiastic" about the introduction

John Pfitsch, the director of
athletics and men's soccer coach,
assesses the problems of adding
women‘s soccer to a lack oi money,
administrators, and players,

The philosophy of Grinnell's athletic
department, according to Piitsch, is
that if interest in an activtty ls exc
hibited, then the college will support
it.

What it all boils down to is that
there will be a Women‘s Soccer Club
in the spring and it will compete
against other teams and clubs.

There are already 25 interested
women practicing on Sundays at 3:00
