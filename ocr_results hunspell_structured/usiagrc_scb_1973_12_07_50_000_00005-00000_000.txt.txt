Render: Norris leaks

To the Editors

Early Tuesday morning, Dec. 4,
l was awakened by the loud thrash-
ing or the rain against my window.
I got Out of bed to secure the win-
dows, which weretightly closed, and
retreated back to bed. About 5:30,
i was awakened once again, but this
time I noticed a steady Stream of
water flowing lrom my window to
the door and out into the halll
aroused my haltrdead roommate
and we proceeded to dispose DI the
water. We were not successful
until 00 PM. Others on the floor,
Norris 3rd, also reported leaks.

Are we to put up with this lime
after time? I will have to buy a
rubber literraft, Surely BKIG could
spend some of their time making
a riddiculoils [enoe On Tenth Street,
but can’t find time to help us here
in Norris.

It also seems to me that storm
windows would beneiit the energy
conservation drive. The bare wine
dows DI the dorms and especially
ARI-I can not hold the heat elfeCr
tively and are always in disrepair.
Where are our priorities?
