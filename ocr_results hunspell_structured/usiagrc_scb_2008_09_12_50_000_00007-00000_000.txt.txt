Stronger, smarter, stoned: mowes cover spectrum

Iron Man
(2008)

Superhero movie a fine example
of the best in its genre; Downey
gives great performance

Ifyou're tired ofrnovies about superheroes who do nothing
but whine about the burden of being super, then Iron M1171 is
for you.

Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, a fabulously rich badeboy
genius and weapons manufacturer. Stark spends his time gam—
bling, drinking, sleeping with gorgeous women (all twelve Play-
boy cover girls from one year), working on fast cars and cor-
rupting his friend Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard). After
an encounter with terrorists (the traditional left-leaning Hollyr
wood message here is unsubtle) and an accident that forces him
to power his heart with a tiny nuclear reactor, he changes coutsc
and becomes the Iron Man we always knew he could become.

Downey fully inhabits his character, playing him with an
outrageous charm and selﬂsatlsﬁcd confidence that somehow
never crosses the Line into obnoxious. opposite him, Gwyneth
Paltrow is wry but patient as Pepper Potts, the Miss Mons
eypenny to his Mt. Bond. The romance is sometimes sweet,
sometimes very awkward,and always entertaining. JeffBridgcs
brings both paternalism and menace to his role as Obadiah
Stane, stark's business partner. The script can be clunky, but
the actors manage to sell even their most ridiculous 0t cliched
lines. A few emotional moments seem to come out of nowhere,
and the plot lags once or twice, but for the most part it flows
smoothly.

Like all the best superhero movies, [Wu Mini is full ofspcc-
tacularly improbable gadgets, thundering fight scenes, and all
sorts of action, Sure, it's a littlc long But the wholclicatted
glee with which Tony Stark embraces his life as Iron Man more
than makes up for any other fiat . I'Ic's about as 4

What do Jon Stewart, Bill Clinton, Mike Mussiua. and
Bob Dole have in common? They all rind rirvic to do the wild-
ly popular tho YaIA' Timct crossword every week. Muff/fly, a

documentary about crossword crrlrure, deftly mixes portraits or

hardcore average Joe fans with fascinating celebrity commene
tary from men like the ones mentioned. Yet the film, like one
ofthe harder puzzles, can be a little discouraging to all but the
most committed.

Ml'df/Izy begins with the careers ofWill Shottz, crossword
editor for the NM) Var/t Timur, and Merl Reagle, the puzzle
constructor. Both men display incredible skill in their work,
and their puzzles are shown to have a huge fan base all over the
world. The infatuation fans have with the crossword becomes
apparent as Will sorts through their letters, one calling him a
“sick, sick, sick, sick man" for a particularly hard puzzle. The
enjoyment ofthe crossword is clear as well, as ran Jon Stewart
gleefully talks smack about Will while solving clue after clue.

Tire first hour of the movie is excellent. with a liberal dose
offunny moments and general wit and satire, After that, as our
lead characters continue to indulge in rinprecedentcd reckless-

much to the audience's dismay, the directors.

The longish ru. g time (118 minutes) means that the
script needs more than relentless decadence to keep the audi-
ence's interest. Unfortunately there is not much of a plot to
speak of.The film is clumsily anchored in a narration (by Done
ald Morrow) whose mockrheroic tone is faithful to the self
caricaturrng attitude oer. Thompson's reportorial altereego,

But hearing this voice in the fragmentary spiels that are
used to splice scenes together is a far different experience from
hearing it shouting and guffawing uninterruptedly in your head
as you read the book, Scenes seem to be very disjointed, and
the luck ofa linear plot really begs the question whether one
is watching 24 five-minute inrernet videos or an actual inovie.
Maybei am being too harsh, but when one considers the catchy
subject inattet, the talent of the actors and the director, coupled
with excellent performances. one can't help but wonder whether
the stiin is, for once, smaller than its parts.
