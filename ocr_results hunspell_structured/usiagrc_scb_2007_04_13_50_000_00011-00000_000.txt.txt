Black Sheep water polo team hosts
conference tourney this weekend

av CAITLIN CARMoDv

Grinnell’s women's water polo team uses “Let's Get Down to
Business" as a song to get them pumped up, but they know how to
have fun too.They're known to make sheep noises during timeouts
and in between quarters.

But Grinnell's Black Sheep have also gotten down to business
in impressive fashion, losing just one conference game this season,
Because of their regular season success, they will host this weekend's
Heartland Conference tournament as the ropesecded team,

While nobody knows the origin oftlie team name, Black Sheep
could easily describe the coaching situation, The Black
Sheep form the only selfrcoached team in the confer
ence. Brian Smith '09. goalie for the men's water polo
team, helps coach during practice but isn't in charge of
the team in the manner that a traditional coach would
be.

Team members agreed thatbeing selfecoached has its
ups and downs.

“Everyone has a say, and if someone isn’t comfortable
with something, the basic id n the team is that you speak up," co-
captain Mari Gunman ’09 said. “But ifsomething comes up that's a
big deal or people don’t agree, it’s harder to get resolution."

Because water polo is a club sport at Gi-innell without a paid
coach, the environment is moic laid back than what would be ext
pected ofa varsity spoit.

“ifyoii have a let of work and don't come to practice, it's not a
huge deal,”eo-captain Liv Gibbons '08 said.

But “club sport" and “laid back" aren’t synonymous with “nun

motivated” for the Black Sheep. The tcani has come a long i .
a short period of time. Two years ago, the team had just. i or
eight players and placed second to last in the conference. Now the
roster is around 20 and the team has a legitimate chance of going
to Nationals.

“We have a really deep tedrn,"Gibbous said,“Othci teams in the
conference tend to have a few star players, which is not to say we

Club
Sports

don’t have star players, but there's a lot ofcnthusiasm about the sport
and a lot ofdcprh [on our team]."

There is a range of experience among team membersisome
have been playing since high school while others started this yeati
but that doesn't affect team unity.

“I've been playing for six years, and this team truly is something
special," Guttman said. “The bond is really strong."

Leah Krandel'09 ioined the team this year with no prior experi-
ence and said she immediately felt comfortable

“Everyone is so welcoming and really supportive," she said. “it

was great to feel so welcome coming into a sport with so
little experience.”

Players described the game as an aquatic combination
of basketball and soccer with a little bit of l‘lOCkC‘V7dll
played while treading water and never touching the bottom
ofthe poolwatei polo as a sport has an intaiuously aggres-
sive reputation; much of the play occurs below the water,
wheie players try to control their opponents'moveiuents in
ways the referees can’t see,

“The better players usually don’t play violently,"5ofia Becker'os,
a two-time all-Conference player, said,“A lot oftimes it's teams that
try to compensate for skills they're lacking by being really aggressive
or really violent,"

The level of violent play has been an issue in the Heartland
conference this season. In Griniiclls last tournament, a player in a
separate game was knocked unconscious and taken to thc hospitd.
With phys' r) such a big part of the game, the Black Sheep try to
play aggre vely without playing violently.

“Our blood boils when we're getting locked or hit, but that’s not
what the game is about,"Gibbons said, ‘

In a unique show of sportsmanship, the Black Sheep will host
the St. Mary's players tomorrow night to save hotel fees that had
threatened to make the tors’ tiip to Giiiinell iinaﬁ'oidable.

The Black Sheep play st. Mary’s at 1:15 pm. tomorrow in
Obciinillei Pool

Golfers play under new coach, gray skies

3v NATE LINDSEY

Like many other spring sports teams, the men's golf team has
been battling the weather as much as opponents over the past few
weeks. Last weekend, the Pioneers participated in the Scoteii‘irc Int
virational in freezing temperatures with strong wind gusts. Before
the tournament was over, nearly half of the teams had withdrawn
early and were heading home from the courses in Galesburg and
Galena, IL.

The Pioneers stayed, however, and placed sixth out of the nine
teams that finished the meet. Coach BrianJaworski saw the decision
to stay as important in fostering a competitive spirit within his team
and important to the program's integrity.

“Conditions were tough the first day, but the second day was
much different,”hc said.“It was still cold,but the sun was out.Whiit
surprised me most was that four conference teams left after reporrr
ing to the clubhouse the second day. They must have their reasons,
burl think it sends a bad message to the studentrathletes, the cone
fcrence, and the other schools who did complete the second day.”

Jaworski, also the men’s soccer coach, is in his first ycai as the
men's golf coach after taking over for cicg Wallace, who had
coached the team since 1992.

“Coach Jaworski is building a winning and competitive mulr
tality that will pay off this season," Trek Langenhan ’07 “And
hopefully [it will] allow us to improve on our fourrhrplat-e confer—
ence finish last year,"

In addition [OJr’lWOl‘Sk‘h new faces on the team include Pete lch’
selbach '10 and Carlos Lu '10, Kiesclbach paced the Pioneers with a
19thrplace Indivldulll finish at the SCOI’P‘HB Invite while Lu tied for
33rd, Kieselbach's competitive nature shone through when he come
mentcd on his teameleatiing performance at the invitational.

“i played well the first day,but [i] putted and chipped poorly the
second day," Kieselbaeh said. “I am not happy with my score, and I
feel like I can do signiﬁcantly better as the season progresses.”

Weather permitting, the team will tiavel to Stoiin Lake, IA to
compete in the Bucna Vista Invitational this weekend.

Even ifthc weather does allow play, conditions are still likely to
be undesirable.

“We are really excited for this weekend even though we just ie-
teived two inches ofsnow, and conditions are supposed to be worse
up in Storm Lake where we play,“Jaivorski said.

Despite the weather forecastJawoiski sees the meet as a valu-
able chance for his hardworking Pioneers to improve.

“I thoughtwe played all right, not great,biit not tcriible,”_lawor-
ski said of the Scotcl‘irc Invitational. “Theic is definitely room for
improvement, and what] like best about this team is that they are
real workers who love to play."

At press time, the meet was still planncd with a scheduled
tee time of 9:30 this moining The meet is scheduled to continue
through tomorrow with a tee time of8:30 a.rn.

Softball kicks off MWC
season this weekend

isv NATE LINDSEY

The weather has been ruthless to the Grinuell
softball [Cam this season, keeping it from hold—
ing many outdoor practices and canceling the past
three doublerlieaders. Nonrconference match-ups
against Cornell College, the University of Chicago
and Buena Vista University have all been can—
celled.

“You can’t do anything about the weather on
the days you have a game scheduled, but as we get
further into the season, rescheduling those contests
becomes problematic,” Coach Tom Sonnichsen
said. “We would certainly rather be playing."

The Pioneers are scheduled to begin conference
play this Sunday and Monday in Janesvilie, W'l. at
the Midwest Conference Softball Classic. Grinnell
has five games scheduled in the Classic against
teams from the North division ofthe MWC.

“We are going to need to rise to the challenge
for the upcoming Crossover Tournament this
weekend, since most of our opportunities to fine
tune various port-tons ofour play have been elimir
nated by the cancdlations," Sonnichsen said. "The
Crossover is not only a test of ability, it is also a test
otstamina and mental focus,"

The Pioneers will not return home for action
until late April against Lake Forest and Mann

mouth.

Men’s tennis undefeated
in Midwest Conference

av PATRICK RITI'ER

The men’s tennis team dropped a match against
Luther College last Saturday to move to 14-6 on
the season, but the Pioneers have yet to lose to an
MWC opponent. Grinneil has dominated confer-
ence foes St. Norbert, Beloit, Lake Forest, illinois
college and Ripon this season, defeating all five
teams without losing any singles or doubles match-
es.

The Pioneers will look to continue their con-
ferencc success a week from tomorrow when they
travel to Illinois to face Knox and Monmouth on
the same day.

Following the Knox and Monmouth matches,
the Pioneers will look to defend their MWC title
in the conference championships on the weekend
oprtil 28.

“We think we could win every spot [in the
championships], all si - singles spots and all three
doubles spots, which as far as I know would be unr
precedented in the Midwest Conference," said Eli
Best '07, the number three player.

To get the sweep, the Pioneers will need a
healthy Dan LaFouiitaine ’09 filling the number
one Spot. LaFountaine was hospitalized with an ills
ness and missed a week of the season. He is healthy
again, bur will need to “get back in shapeand get
sharp," said Best.

If the Grinnell team is able to meet expecta-
tions with a fourthrstmight conference title, its vet-
eran players will ﬁnally get the opportunity to play
in the national tournament. This is the ﬁrst year
that the MWC will receive an automatic bid. In
past years, only the top eight teams at-large in the
region received bids-and the MWC missed out on
them because of a reputation foi not being a strong
tennis conference.

Because of that reputation and a 9-6 non—con-
ference record, the Pioneers will probably receive
.i high seed to nationals if they win rhc ch,
meaning they would have to face one of the top
teams in the country in the first round.

“We‘ll probably be an underdog in the first
round," said Best. “But we’re looking forward to it.
I'm in my senior year and ﬁnally [may] get a chance
to o,"

gThe Pioneers will host the Central Dutch on
Tuesday at 4:30 pm, in what will be the final home
match in the senior playcrs'caicci-s.
