own experiences during that time,
He related how he was called to
be a missionary and said that

where he desired to go. he placed
Japan at the top, and chose But

he would work, He gave a short
description of the country and
the character olthe people, He

excellent people to do business

their good and bad qualities. He

get along with peacetuily. He
spoke of the excellent ﬁghting
qualities of the Bulgarians and

This year marks the tenth air-
niversary ot the ﬁrst gridiron
battle between elevens represent-
lug Antes and Grinnell, in octo-
berng3 a liiisky team from the
State College lined up against the
home e'cven, who although out-
weighed tourteen pounds to the
man, knew vastly more football.
Beforetlley had done they had
rnl‘licted a 4276 score upon tlieir
dazed opponents, This initial
victory seemed to set a fateful
precedent, srrice tliat»time Grins
nell has won 7games, lost 2 and
tied r, of the to games played,
and the Grinnell “hootloo” \vitll
Ame; has become as notorious as
the Iowa ”lioodoo" with other
state teams. The next game bee
tween the two institutions was
played in the tollowing year, when
Ames sent a better -rained aggre-
gation and was dclcated only
uttera‘ hard struggle l4 6. No
game was played in 1895 and
thereby Ames was spared a
grievous trouncing by what was
probably the strongest team in
the history of Grinnell athletics.
It wasin this year that Grinnell

defeated Minnesota 6 4.

But with the next year came a
reversal ofform. Grinnell’steani
composed largely ot new men and
disheartened by the absence of
Captain Tcmpleman was powec
less against the ﬁerce rushes at a
veteran team and when the game
entledtlrc score stood Antes do
Grinnell 0. Now comes the
brightest spot in Grinnell’s
atiileiic:aninials,ilrc Amcsgame or
’97. It marks the crest nl that
wave of the Grinnell spirit which
has been sweeping so irresistably
down the ages, and is probably
reckoned by many an alumnus as
one of the world'sdccislvc battles.

Never was a victory so hard
won. never was it so appreciated
by the student body as was this
one why. The Ames team at
rived supremely conﬁdent be-
cause of relative scores made

Ithat y ar, and because ol the easy

the fall
betore, Grinnell‘s champions on
the contrary entered the game
wrtli but one thought, a desperate
determination to avengetlic score
oi the year belore. The opening
moments of the game proved a
revelation to the critics. Grm»
nelltook Ames off its feet, mak
ing gain atier gain in quick suc-
cession, Gray hnany crossing the
coveted goal line, During there
inninder of the half both teams
struggled desperately but neither
was able to score. the half closing
with the score 60 in favor of
Grinnell. The second half started
witharush. By a series of ex
chungesit was Grinnell‘s ball on
Amestourteen yard line and in
ﬁve plays it was pushed over tor
the second touchdown, Follow-
ing soon alter the next kick ott
Grinnell tumbled the ball nearher
owngoal line. an Aincs man fell
upon irand Amcs scored. The
remainder ot the half was asgame
an exhibition of a lighter and ex-
hausted team withstanding the
ﬁerce rushes of giant opponents
as will ever be witnessed days
where. By playing a kicking
gaiiicniid by presenting a stone-
wall defcnse at critical moments
the Grinnell eleven managed to
prevent any further scoring and
the game ended Grinnell i2,
Anies 6.

No game was played in '93. In
‘97 were registered two more
Victories the ﬁrst one 15—0, being
attributable directly to Wheeler's
leg. three goals trom the ﬁeld no
counting fur'the total score. From
this contest dates the use of a
kicking game by a Grinnell team
to any great extent. Burd's punts
doing quite as much to win the
game as Wheeler's drop kicks.
Laterin the season Grinnell again
defeated theCorn Huskersosothis
times by straight hard football,

During the next season pers
haps the most disastrous the
SCARLET awn BLACK has ever ex~
perienced: another Victory was
won over Ames by the creditable
score of 227;.

The ﬁnal game ot root resulted
in another Grinnell victory 2370
although anexhibitiorl game was
played earlier in thc season in
which neither side could score.

Last [all as all will remember
the score was reversed Ames
winning a hard fought struggle,
2370, The exultation of the I. O
c. R. tollowingthis victory knew
no bounds and it has since been
their fondest boast that the Grins
ncll “hoodoo” is broken, but is
it? Another team will yet arise
to duplicate the performance of

 

that of ‘97.

 

THE BALL IS IN PLAY.

Grinnell and Amcs are ﬁghting hard.

About zoo Antes rooters accom-
panied by the famous German
Band arrived til town this morn-
ing on the Central.

The two teams lined up this
alterndon at 2:400" Ward Field
The average weight ot Ames is
180, while Grinnell barely ave‘r-
ages too.

The rooting of the l. O. C, RT
is supurb. though the A. 0. U. R.
of Grinnell is not to be outdone.

Ames kickes off to Grinnell's
25 yard line and on a tumble re-
ceives the ball. After is minutes
at play Ames makesa touchdown
but fails to kick goali

A second touchdown was made
after [0 minutes of play by a
series of heavy line smashes,
which Grinnell could not stop
Ames kicked goal.

The last score was made a few
minutes before time was called by
the use of the same tactics as
adopted betore, though the plays
mg was slower. Goal was
ed.

Grinnell makes long gains
around the ends while Amcs gains
byline smashing. The playing
is last and turious and physical'
training will play an important
part on ﬁnal outcome,

Robinson for Grinnell is play-
ing a star game and has made
several long runs.

Between halves that famous
little German Band discoursed
sweet strains while the Grinnell
aggregation marched up and
down the Field singing “boola
boo," sochecr up, it mightbe
worse.
