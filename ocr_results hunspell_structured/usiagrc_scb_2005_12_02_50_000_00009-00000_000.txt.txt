Welcome to India

A Grinnelli‘an’s guide to the overlooked aspects of life in India

It's difficult to sum up exactly what being in Int
did for four months has taught me, I have learned
that no pre-pi-ogi-ain orientation guide will ever give
a good idca or what the experience of the program
will be like, and ovei the semester l'vc bccn rewriting
my program guide with an eye to the practicality of
living in south lndia. These are areas I think were
inadequately addressed.
Claritmg
it's a curious society (from my point of view) in
which you can be completely decently dressed without
underwear, but not with
out jewelry, Underwear, if
you're a female, is not a ne-
cessity, and who will ever
know? in fact, it may well
be a liability,s_iiiee heat and
moisture are two of South
India’s greatest natural re-
sources, and there's no toilet paper, only watei.
sure, you'll want to wear it now and again, bur
generally you'll have so many layers of clothing down
to your ankles that there will never be any danger
ous consequences of not wearing

underwear, and its one less thing 60ng (ammundo lS abom‘ me only

Also, it's something ofn rebels
lion against the meters and meters
of cloth that go into Indian dress.

For example, ifyou're a girl and you want to wear
pants, you have to wear a scarf too, even when it's 110
degrees out with blistering sunshine, and your gor-
geous tropical tan will end at the sleevcllnc. Going
commando' is about the only way to stick it to the
man, and its surprisingly convenient and comfort-
able.

driving is on the left, but this is an inadequate descripr

Driving might be on the left in an ideal situation
involving perfect weather conditions, the existence
oflane markers, the absence ofany other cars on the
road, and an inclination on the part of the driver.

Love is a topic that's on everyone's mind all the
time, according to Tamil TV. Every song is a love
song. Every film is a love story What I've learned
from cinema and television is that people who are in
love tend to wear matching clothes. They also spend
a lot of time running through fields, getting caught in
the rain and/or standing under waterfalls or in rivers,

'l'he stateof mental health at Grinnell Fulfill Promise of

I have a mild bipolar disorder and a more serious depressive dis-
order that became noticeable when I was in sixth grade. After years
spent believing that everyone felt as I did,l finally realized early in high
school that something was wrong with my emotional state. I decided
to wait until college to get help because I was too self-conscious and
embarrassed to admit in my home community that I was abnormal.
In keeping with my decision, a few weeks after I arrived at Grinnell
last fall 1 went to Walk in and listed offeverythingl found problematic
about my behavior and emotions the insomnia and atoticty, the catiii'g
disorders the mood swings and the crushing depression

The 12 succeeding months were some of the
hardest ofmy life, as not only did I have to cope
with my disoi‘dcis in a new environment, but
I had to deal with a misdiagnosis and improper
medication that caused my mama to worsen. by
the end ofsccond scinestei, I was near collapse, I
was exhausted, afraid and, as oprril, had to cope
with the death ofa friend from home,

I badly needed help, and I continue to feel that I didn’t get the
support I needed from Grinnell college staff. I went to see Dean
Crady at the beginning ofthis semester and he admitted that my case
was not handled properly I didn't question the dean's assurances at
the time ofour meeting and i left feeling reasonably secure that my
peers were being better taken care ofthen I had been.

This security lasted a matter of weeks. I have since heard several
friends with mental illness or associated disorders, such as bulimia,
speak of negative experiences they have had with various Grinnell
employees, These friends’ responses range from believing that the
health professionals and student staff on campus are not properly
equipped to help them, to feeling like no one is paying attention
to the problems plaguing them and other students. 1 have no idea
whether this represents a bend, or if my friends and I have simply
been unlucky, but I am worried that mentally ill Grinnell students are
getting lost in the system,

If this is true, the college needs to heal from

issue too important to remain silent about.

No one should be left to cope with depression oi iiny other mental
illness alone, rind Grinnell College has the resources to make sure
students wont have to struggle on their own. Im not sure that these
resources air being used properly, but with feedback and an effort to
improve, hopeﬁilly no Grinnell student will ever be as discouraged its

The Salad clarifies its petition

SPARC’s letter to the SEER (Nov. 18,2005) states that “no extra
requests for extra funding were made," To elarifyThe Salad did at
tempt to negotiate with SPARC members for additional funding at
the end ofthe application process.

When SPARC gave us less than half ofwhat we originally re
quested for the first issue,we chalked that up to our lack of preparas
tion. We hope that now that we have a finished issue and 304 sig-
nanires, we will be eligible for enough money to put out two issues
next semester.

After the ﬁrst issue of“Thc Salad" came out, we brieﬂy circus
lated a petition in order to provide support for increased SPARC
funding next semester, The text is available on our Plan [salad].

We decided to create this petition after SPARC's business mans
ager Phyo bakyii presented the budget breakdown at Joint Board
in October. An audience member asked how SPARC decided to
allocate funds, and he said it was based on “student interest." We
therefore chose to provide SPARC with evidence ofstudent interest
through collecting signatures,

We appreciate the positive feedback from SPARC and the Col-
lege community and encourage anyone with questions to contact us
at ml/Id@grl'tm2/I. c1111.

need- based aid

Ask almost anyone about Grinnell's ﬁnancial aid,
and they will tell you it is excellent. The college's
own publications proclaim that every student’s aid
package “meets 100 percent of demonstrated need,”
and dint no one will be unable to attend Grinnell
for ﬁnancial reasons. This is an excellent theory, and
students do beneﬁt from Grinnell’s generous finan-
dal aid, but unfortunately, the college recruiters and
publications are not telling the whole truth.

Yuri Zobnclicv'08,vvho transferred into Grinnell
this semester, will be transferring out for next se-
inestei: It is not hecatise he does not like it here, or
because the academics art: too hard, It is because he
cannot afford the amount ofloiu-is from the shortfall
in his ﬁnancial aid. Everyone that knows Yuri wants
him to stay, but he is being forced away from this
school due to his ﬁnancial situation. Other private
liberal arts colleges might only admit students whose
parents can pay all of their expenses, but Grinnell
is committed to diversity, and giving students from
diverse economic backgrounds an opportunity to get
one of the finest educations in the country

There is no guesswork or speculation in this state-
ment. But the college is shirking its self—proclaimed
duties, In not providing Yul-i the ﬁnancial means to
stay enrolled, they are betraying their primary goal of
being a need—blind institution, as well as letting one
of the finest students currently enrolled slip away
If you want to hold the college accountable for its
promises, or if you are one of the many priVileged
who enjoy the company of Yuri, please show your
support by contacting President Osgood and asking
him to prove his commitment to the goals ofhimsdf
and Grinnell college.
