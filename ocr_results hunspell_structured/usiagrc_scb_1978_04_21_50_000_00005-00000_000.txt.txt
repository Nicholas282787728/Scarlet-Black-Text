Disarmament: another look ‘

The upcoming antinuclear
protest demonstration at Rocky
Flats. Colorado is doubtless
Sincerely meant and well~
intentioned. but some of the
specific aims and objectives of the
pmtcsters are open to serious
question

it would be difficult to dispute
the relevance of the protest in
addressing issues such as the
danger of nuclear proliferation and
[he health hazards of nuclear
facilities. but the demonstrators'
emphasis on disarmament is
neither Wise nor efficacious. The
protesters cannot hope to achieve
any meaningful progress toward
disarmament by their action, and
even ii they could, the type oi
disarmament which they are
seeking is likely to be disastrous.

According to their pamphlet, lhe
Rocky Flats Action Group seeks to
send a clear message to US and
foreign defense policymakers to
halt the arms race. among other
things. The implication is that the
United States government.

fluence of the mi 'tary industrial

arms race and expand its stack of
nuclear weapons if it were nol for
this public pressure But no one
likes living under the shadow ol
nuclear destruction and the ad-
ministration needs no prodding to
be persuaded that its own goal of
abolition oi nuclcar weapons is a
uorthy one. ,

is hard to conceive that a public
outcry would have any eiicct on
negotiations moving towards a
goal so universally agreed upon
but whose details are extremely
technical and complex. The ad
ministration is doing what it can,
and it is no use urging it to go
farther. faster and to do more
Disarmament simply cannot be
expressed in those terms. it is a
mutual process. and no govern-
ment can blithely decide to pursue
a policy of disarmament without
protracted international
negotiations

Yet the Rocky Flats protesters
seem to be calling for just that, for
thc us. to follow a policy oi
unilateral disarmament. The U S.

The unpleasant truth of the
