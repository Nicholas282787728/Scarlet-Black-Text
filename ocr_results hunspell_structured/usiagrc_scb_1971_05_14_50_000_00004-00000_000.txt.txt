C Di HP-AWS: Appointments,

New Student Days, Budget

The Joint Boards met for the
second time since theelection
of new house presidents Wed‘
nesday night.

Items on the agenda included
die selection of representa-
tives for the Committee A
committees, new student days
programs, president orientar
tion programs for late sum-
mer, use of the new phys ed
complex and the outgoing fin-
ance committee's recommen-
ded budget.

Carolyn Ashbaugh spoke on
the projected new student days
program. Phil Sasich express
sed a widespread feelingwhen
he asked for more time for
hails to get together on their
own, both formally and infor~
mally. There was a great deal
of discussion on the amount
and type of orientation on sex
and drugs there should be for
freshmen.

Support was expressed for
the committee's idea ofhaving
students conduct workshops
for the freshmen.

The board authorized the
executive cabinet to go ahead
with plans for an outside per
son to lead some sort ofgroup
dynamics session forhallpre-
sidents. Consensus was that
presidents would return the
Tuesday before new student
days for orientation prog-
rams.

John Pfitsch, director ofath-
letics, spoke at length about
the use of the phys ed complex
next fall. He was pessimistic
about the prospects of the
complex being completed by
September ’1, even the swims
ming pool.

Presidents urged him to go
,ahead with plans toinvlte each

”*"of the halls to the c'omplex'for
some sort oforientationparty,
and ‘ everyone agreed that
times should be ﬂexible for
all halls.

Major changes in the ﬁnance
committee‘s budget proposal
were an increase in funds for
radio and the newspaper, from
$3300 to $4000 and from $5500

Development Office have ex~
pressed support for a year-

ance committee to look into
the possibilities. She added
that funds might be forthcomr
ing for such a project from
the administration.

The most debatewas sparked
by the suggestion that hall
funds be deleted from the bud-
get and that the moneybeadd»

Phil' Sasich led the object-
ors, who were concerned that
the money might be hard to

among the halls might not be
fair.

ving the funds addeda “strong
recommendation" that the
administration finance the
rest of the trip’s cost, which

Plan Fteshman Orientation

by Carolyn Ashbough

The. 1971 New Student Days
Committee is planning an in—
novative and exciting intro-
duction to Grinneil. The com—
mittee is working for an inte~
gration of academic and resi»
dence hall life. During New
Student Days (Aug. 27—29) we
hope to emphasize the "com'
munity of the dorm and its
place in the extended com-
munityqthe campus. We hope
the new students will become
aware of the academic possi-
bilities within the dorm, that
they will bring residence hall
experience out of the dorm-
that there will not be a dic»
hotomy between amdemic life
and residence hall life.

The attitudes which an indi»
vidual formsabout himselfand
about others during his four
years at college will very
likely determine the course of
his life. The habits and abili-
ties which the individual ac»
quires are going to be used
somehow; and theyare goingto
be used by someone. It is im~
portant that the individual con»

trol the use of his mind or
that he know who controls it
and why. The student should
consider the educational pro
cess from the beginning ofhis
college educationupreferably
earlier. I would hope that the
New Student Days program
will raise questions about the
educational process as it ex-
ists at Grinnell and at other
institutions and will serve as
a foundation upon which a stir
dent may build his own educa-
tion.

We hope to deal with the be-
lief that the educational pro-
cess functions only from in-
structor to student; we wish
to emphasize the importance
of the student to student edu—
cational process. That educa-
tion is a collective process,
that students shouldfeeleager
and free to share their study
and research with other stud-
ents is important to creating
the integration ofactivities on
the Grinnell Campus forwhich
we hope. Education does-<and
must-extend beyond the class-
room, beyond xhe library.

"Death As A Way of Life"

How many and what kinds of
animals are used on this mm-
pus for “research," and tobe
picked apart? Cats, rats, tur-
tles, pigs, sharks, mice,
frogs, protozoans, chicks 1.
they should be regarded not
as subjects. but as the living,
breathing creatures they are
(were). Professors and stud-
ents have accepted the res-
ponsibility for their lives and
no grade or professor's rev
assuring pat for a dissection
well done should justify des-
troying the life of the animal.
Sixty frogs are not needed for
sixty biology students; a mo-
vie, or worse, one frog, would
suffice. Intro to Psychology
students must understand that
rats will be killed when fin-
ished with their “dipper train-
ing," after being cagedfor the

420 New Faces Next Year

Dean of Admissions Nicholas
Ryan told the 5&8 Wednesday
that 420 students, including 24
transfers, have sent in their
$100 deposits indicating that

' they will be students nextyear.

The administration has esti-
mated that 413 new students
will be needed to reach the
optimum level of 1250 stud-
ents. However, this figure is
dependent on the highly un~
predictable attrition rate (i.e.,
how many upperclassmen
don't return next fall).

The 420 figure is also quite
uncertain as there are some
prospective students who have

‘ been given an extended deadc

line for replying to the colle-
ge's offer of admission. In
addition, more and more stud-
ents in recent years have
shown a willingness to forfeit
their deposits and to go to
another school.

Ryan was very well pleased
with admissions’ success this
year, since applications were
down quite a bit from previous
years (a pattern that was seen
all across country). ‘

In contrast to lastyear,when
many more girls came than
boys, there is an even split
in this entering class.

Twenty-one black students
have‘ accepted the college's
offer of admission.

America has become a

to regard life in no more im-
portant terms than a tin can

replaced with an order to a

Friday evening. We are hop-
ing that :an informal "meeting
prior to pre registration will
help the ‘new students in think-
ing about the direction they
want to ke in their studies,
and will alleviate some of the
difficulties of that first indi-
vidual canference. Later, time
is reserved for the student
advisorsland hall officers to
work with the new students.

On Satu‘fday morning, weare

HP Election Upsets; Dibble

To: members of Dibble Hall
From: Bill Thomas (for the
SGA)

In the election for nextyear's
president of Dibble Hall, there
were several problems which
disturbed some of the mem-
bers of that hall. These con-
sisted of problems centering
around the vote count and the

manner in which it was con-

ducted.

Subsequently, eight mem-
bers of the hall fileda come
plaint with the student coor-
dinator's office, citing char-
ges that the senior conducting
the election, Frank Thomas,
had been overzealous inguar-
ding the secrecy of the vote,
and that when he did finally
quote some figures as to re-
sults, there were discrepan—
cies in his figures between the
supposed number of ballets
cast and the sum of the vote
tallies. John Petts also wrote
to the coordinator‘s office,
requesting that the election be
investigated. CraigKuglsalcai,
assistant student coordinator,
contacted me, and asked me,
as former C of HP president
and election board member to
assist in claring this up.

In contacting the various par
ties involved, It became clear
that there were sufficientmis‘v
understandings involved in
this hassle to warrantanother
election, if for no other rea-
son than to clear the air for
Dibble fornextyear. However,
i talked ayin to John Pctts.
and he decided that, in view

of a number of signed state-
ments filed with me by Mark
Nissen (to the effect thatthese
people had voted for him and
would do so in another elec-
tion), Lhellateness of the date,
and me hassle involvedin get-
ting another election, he would
withdraw, his name from the
candidacy to settle thematter.
Therefore, as the situation
now stands, Mark Nissen will
be Dibble hall president next
year. .
