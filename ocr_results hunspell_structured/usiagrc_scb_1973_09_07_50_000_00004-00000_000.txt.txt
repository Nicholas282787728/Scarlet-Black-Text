Community Resources

Require Support

. KDlC is in danger of losing its Associated Press teletype news
, service and, in doing so, of violating both its license and federal
law. '

The facts are fairly simple -~ the station is required by law to
have facilities to receive and disseminate information for the
Emergency Broadcast System (BBS), and to serve “the public cone
venience and necessity.” Teletype news service, when properly
utilized, meets both these criteria. ‘

KDIC ‘is a community resource in the truest sense of the word.
It is the primary source of instant information for the campus, be
it time of crisis (a major news event) or time of simple chaos (a
major campus event is cancelled, postponed, or otherwise altered.)

It has acquitted itself admirably in times of real crisis. During
Iowa’s April blizzard, the station performed a number of public
service functions for both Campus and city, providing information
and news 'under trying conditions.

But, the community benefitting from this major resource has ace
quitted itself poorly. Whenever money needs to be cut from an SGA
account, KDIC almost always loses to somebody else’s benefit.
When the administration has information to disseminate, it uses
KDIC. When KDlC needs money, the administration notes that KDIC
is an independent entity and that funds for such purposes are un-
available
This is not a time for allocating blame or pointing fingers. The
simple'fact is that 1(ch needs money now to retain its teletype news
service. i _

But the teletype is just the first issue. Other equipment at the
station is breaking down, as the normal aging process occurs. A
new control board is already ordered. A new transmitter will be
needed in the not too distant future. Much of the station’s other
equipment is either inadequate or out of service.

Grinnell has done a poor job of supporting this community resource
as a community. A small portion of the student activity fee is all
that supports KDlC. ' . ._

Support is needed from all portions of the community -- students,
faculty, administration, trustees, and even townspeople. Money for
the teletype is the immediate goal.-A stable financial base is the
ultimate objective. t
To save a community resource of inestimable value,
act as a community to find the necessary funds.

Information Must

Precede Elections

We must protest the handling of the year’s first SGA referendum.
Although it may be argued that the issues involved were more
administrative restructuring than anything else, the conduct of this
year's first election certainly leaves a great deal to be desired,
v Both issues, the elimination of the hall vice president, to be re»
placedhy a hail coordinator, and the changes in the requirements

’for offrcampus college owned SGA representatives, were carried
over from last semester.

In its last meeting, the Joint Boards approved both amendments,
and ordered a referendum. However, the student body under which
these actions were taken and the student body today are two very
different entities.

‘ Today’s student body has over 400 new members, who have aba
solutely no background for these issues. Yet, they are informed
on Monday that they must vote the next day on the issues.

Further, the information sheet provided by the SGA for all students
said of the first proposal, “This amendment was unanimously
endorsed by the Joint Board."

A check of SGA’s own minutes for the May 9, 1973 meeting, where
the issue was decided, shows the true tally was 1275-0 ,_ hardly
unanimous.

SGA officials describe the misleading statement as an oversight,
and there is no evidence that it was intentional. However, with the
extremely short notice provided, it seems to us that at least rudi—
mentary precautions might have beenitaken. One official’s explana-
tion that, “nobody cares anyway” is really not satisfactory.

SGA has a great many important issues to consider this year,
The House Presidents have, so far, appeared interested and cone
cerned. We hope that the haphazard mannerlin which this refer-
endum was conducted is not a taste of how SGA decision will be
reached for the rest of the year.

”THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS...'73”

Youngberg lakes 0n Admissions

(Ed. note--The following open let-
ter to president Glenn Leggett is
reprinted here in condensed form at
the request oi the author.)

Dear Mr. Leggett,

Your recent expression of inter-
est in Iowans, alumni children. and
athletics has struck me very badly.
l‘m not sure you‘don’t envision a
new policy to lower the percentage
of Jews on campus though I can
hardly outright accuse you of an-
tisemitism. l fear that ynur empty
phraseology cloaks such intentions
though Grinuell certainly has Jewish
alumni, Iowa its Jews, and athle-
tics without a doubt its Jewish par»
ticipants. It is your application,
not your words which would make
the diiierence.

if your motivations are a little
deeper perhaps you wish to regain
for Grinnell its lowan and even
Midwestern image of long ago. Bad
publicity especially in the Des More
nesltegister has caused Iowans to
distrust Grinnell because oiits ”Big
City" atmosphere. lt is notGrinnell
the town of which I speak. How
many of those Iowan students you
talk about, students at the local
high schonls, even come onto Grin-
nell’s campus, There isthe Duffy and
Steakhouse’s clientele and the Long—
horn's clientele. The separation is
most unusually distinct in orinnell.
The college is pointedly unfriendly
to its own hometown. Here is a
problem. Perhaps yo'u‘have a start
at its solution. Reducing the thirty
percent Jewish constituency down
to the usual ten percent and trying
to keep out the less conformist ei-
ement from the big city high sch»
ools hardly strike me as the most
constructive measures. And, lowa
students and alumni children sim-
Dlv don’t exist to solve this sch-

Granted the regressiveness of your

in question. Grinnell could be hurt.

Shields 0n Boycott

To the Editors:

A discussion of the United
Farm Wrokers struggle was
presented by Bob Qulent and
Charlie Becker. Debate follow—
ed Dver whether the SGA had
the “right“ to deprive unsyma
pathetic students of their
“right“ to eat lettuce and
grapes, Jerry Ramaker of Saga
and Mr. Pomerank were also‘
present, Potts moved to hold
a referendum to completely
boycott icebni-g lettuce from
Saga with a 2/3 majority vote.
Nightengale added a friendly
amendment to include the boy-
cott of grapes on a separate
ballot, Motion passed lS-Z-lu
Balloting will take place within
a few weeks in the lunch and
dinner lines.

After considering many different
beginnings, liinally decided simply
to preface this letter with the pre-
ceeding excerpt from the SGA Joint
Board Minutes cl August 29, l973.
The excerpt is rather self explana-
tory,‘ and provides a concise de-
scription oi the action taken by the
SGA (“to hold a reierendum to com—
pletely boycott iceberg lettuce from
SAGA with a 2/3 majority vote”)
What is not provided by this dess
cription is a justification for the
action

The most common justification of-
fered by those who voted in favor
of the SGA lettuce motion seems
to be simply that a boycott of Teamv
ster lettuce is a good thing. In
other words, since the Teamsters
union is oppressing farmworkers
and the UFW is, hopefully, helping
the farmworkers strive toward a
better existence, it is essential to

help farmworkers by boycotting
Teamster grown lettuce. What is the
problem with this justification?
Should We not help the farmworkez‘s
by boycotting Teamster lettuce?
Both of the rhetorical questions
can be answered by looking past the
lettuce issue that the SGA so eager,
1y faced, and seeing an equally ime
portant procedural issue that the Q
sea chose to ignore.

personally I feel that boycotting
Teamster lettuce is a good cause.
I would sign a pledge committing
myself to a boycott. However, when
the SGA asserts that tweethirds of
the Grinnell student body can tell
the other third that they must boy-
cott lettuce, the SGA procedure is
violating individual rights.

A Student Coming to Grinnell Col—
lege has the right to assume that
certain baSic foods will be included
in his/her diet. Lettuce, a staple
in the diet of many vegetarians, is
one of these foods, On‘the basis of
last year’s figures, if a campus,
wide boycott of iceberg lettuce were
instituted as many as one-third of
the Grinnell student body could be
iorceably deprived of head lettuce
for much of the year. (And how
many students on this campus ace
tually eat leaf lettuce?) *

The SGA has no right to alter the
individual student's board plan in
this manner. Coercion Should not
be employed to gain support for the
lettuce boycott even ii boycotting
lettuce Is a good cause.

in concluding lwill briefly outlinei
what l believe to be 3 fairer manner
of approaching the question of the
lettuce boycott. instead Of the SGA‘
determining that two-thirds of the-\
students involved should be allowed
to decide the question for the re,

. malnlng third, why can’t the stua

GEMS be allowed f0 decide the quESr
tion ior themselves? Why can’tSaga
be obliged to buy UFW head lettuce
when it is available, and when it is
not available serve a limited amount
oi Teamster lettuce (marked on the
bowl) for students who wish to eal‘
Teamsier lettuce? Mr. Ramaker‘
will attest to the fact that this method
of running the lettuce boycott ispre.
fectly ieasihle, Why isn't it done?
I don’t know why. 1 voted against
having the referendum
it. Robert Shields
president of Smith Hal.
