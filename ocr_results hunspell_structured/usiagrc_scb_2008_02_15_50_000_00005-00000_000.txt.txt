Center for Prairie Studies
begins new series of talks

BYCLAIRE Rccoert

The Center for Prairie Studies (CPS)
is presenting a new series ortalks this se-
mcstcr which will focus on the link be—
twccn agriculture and the city and avenues
to strengthen and expand this connection.

This series oflcctures, entitled "Spread-
ing sustainable Agriculture," is intended
to explore the ways in which snstainable
agriculture practices may be carried out in
the city.

“We have held lectures in the past about
agriculture, the Farm Bill, local foods and
community sustainable Agriculture," said
CPS Director Jon Andelson, Anthropolt
cgy.
“But we want to show how all of these
ideas can also apply in the city."

The first talk in the series featured
Teva Dawson ofthe Des Moines Parks and
Recreation Department. Dawson spoke
Tuesday about Digging Deeper, which is,
according to its website, “a collaborative
project between public and private instit
tutions to increase food security in Des
Moines, IA through strengthening and
expanding its local/regional food system."

Erin Sindewald ’09, who spent last
summer working with the local farmers
market, Community Supported Agricult
rure farmers and sustainable agriculture
projects as the Grinnell Area Local Foods
Alliance/CPS intern, said it is important
for individuals to take advantage of their
unique surroundings.

“We spend so much time trying to
compensate and show that Grinnell as a
college and a locale is great except that it's
‘in the middle of nowhere,w said Sinde-
wald.

“CPS works to stress that it’s great here
because of our beautiful landscape and our
surroundings, not in spite ofthcmi"

The CPS sponsors numerous lectures
series to bring together students and the
community to open a dialogue of appreci-
ation, recognition and awareness ot“pluce"
while pursuing its stated mission to "pro-
mote understanding of and connection to
our place and its people."

Other CPS efforts include collabora-
tions with campus organizations like Free
the Planet, student projects such as Eco-
House and the campus garden.

The Center is also sponsoring a short
course this semester taught by Prof. Lon-
nie Gamble of Maharishi University in
Fairﬁeld, IA entitled "Renewable Energ
The Energy Basis for Humans and Na-
ture," which was oversubscribed.

“We focus our attention not only on
the science of the prairie, but on location,
itS‘ nature and culture, and their interac-
tion," said Andelsont

The next lecture in the series will be
February 28 featurinngm Wilson, direc-
tor of City Farm Chicago on ”Creating
Sustainable Urban Agriculture in Chi—
cage."
