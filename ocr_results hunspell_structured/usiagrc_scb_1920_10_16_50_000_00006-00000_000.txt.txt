In order to promote ihe unity of
interest and support or home and uni-
ty of action and viewpoint on Ille iieltl
it was decided to select a certain 107
cality in China and to concentrate
Gl'iuhell inter-est on that section. A
portion ot Shantung Province lying
about Techou and Tsiuanru wns se-
lected. In the broadest sense men the
term Grinnell—in—China would include
the work carried on hyﬁrmncll peo-
ple in that region whether they he

. teachers: ministers, doctors, nurses,
athletic dir-ector-s, hrrsiness men or
anything else. In this sense the var
lation is rather indeiinitsand is large»
1y a matter of sentiment.

Is Extension of Griilliell

But the ter-rn'Gr-rnnelhm-China is
also applied to the preparatory schools
at Techou.’ It is to these institutions
that most at our support goes. Here
the connection is very close. In ad-
drticn to furnishing the personnel and
giving the support, Grinnell through
its committee representing iaculty,
students and alumni, has a voice in
shaping the policies and planning the
work. In this sense Gl'innelleiixchinu
is more than a place where we send
men and money. It is an extension
of Grinneil.

In addition to these preparatory
schools Grinnell has been invited to
share in the higher work of Shautung
Province A union inter-denomination!
al institution with departments of lrh-
eral arts. medicine and theology is
now, undei construction at Tsinantn,
the capital of Shantung, about eighty
Miles tr-orn Techou. Under- the pres
ent plan Grinnell is to provide thr-ee

. instructors in this institution. They
are to he supported by an endowment
of $100,000. The American Board will
furnish oneehzllf or this if Grinncll
cairn-aloe $50,000. 'Dvei' mono of
this amount has already been secured.

Mrs. Paul MacEachmn Writes of

Following is an extract from iotv

M .. Paul llaelsachron, who is assist-
ing her husband, lllr. panl IlacEaeh-
you in Gl‘ihuelleiu-Chinzt work in the
famine districts:

“Paul has been overwhelmed with
people asking for help this roll that
he could hardly get any work done.
were going to he awfully up against
it this winter to know what to do
about all the calls hr help that come.
When people are dying around you
you must help all you can, People
are just selling off everything they
can share. ‘

“There is 'an old lady who has been
coming out from the city every day
Bringing rases, dishes, etc, and ul'g»
ing us to hny. She says the children
have nothing to eat and they don’t
know what they can live on all win—
ter. None of her things are worth
anything but we all bought some just
to help her out. I could write pages
of harrowing tales that we hear, and
a lot of things that we see, -

"We went down to the station‘to
meet the Tientsilig people the other
evening and I never saw so many
beggars in my life and some ot the
awfullest children (most of them nails
ed) and some with such sore eyes
that they were just thick with ﬂies
and the children didn't have “pep"
enough to push them off. No matter
how much money we get trom home

or the Rod omss her-e, thousands are
bound to the. They usually have rust
bar-rip enough to keep them olive in
the winter, so when a time like tins
comes they give up and die. One of
