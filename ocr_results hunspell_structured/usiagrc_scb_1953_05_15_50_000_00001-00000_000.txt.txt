Other occupants oi the small
room with its Niagara.Ealls

mental honeymonors, bakers
on convention, ,singcrs record»

rather stodgy novelist and his

All the. small tales, each
enacted as one day spent in the
suite are heightened by the in—
terrdption of detectives and
plumbers, and Chris Saul’s
clever portrayal of a modern
wandering bard, his romatic
quotes complete with gestures.

tip.

Music for the all student pro»
