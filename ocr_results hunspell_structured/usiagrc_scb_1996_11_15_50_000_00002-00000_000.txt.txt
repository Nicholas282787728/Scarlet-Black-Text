ALSO hiatus to end next semester

Coordinator Dan Gross will return after illness

BY LINDSAY HAGY
Staff Writer

Although Grinnell's Alternate
Language Study (ALSO) program
was suspended this semester due to
the emergency medical leave of its
coordinator, Daniel Gross, it Will be
fully continued forthe upcoming se-
mester. This highly successful pro-
gram is designed to offer students a
chance to study languages not other
wise offered in order to prepare for
off campus study or simply to em,
hellish their curriculum at Grinnell

Began in l983, this is the only
self-study language program offered
in Iowa, A language may be studied
at Grinnell if at least three students
are interested and it proper materi-
als and a student tutor are available.
The program lasts for a minimum
of two semesters duriltg which par-
ticipating students are expected to
design a daily lesson plan, in addi-
tion to three drill sessions a week
with their tutor. The students’
progress is evaluated twice a semes—
lcr by an outside examiner. In past
years, Grinnell students have studr

 

around trying to tell people they’re
doing things wrong." Milleragreed,
stating that she likes to follow the
wellrknown saying: “Hate the sin
but love the sinner,"

However, once a member of the
organization deCides to ascend to a
leadership position, Miller explained
that “they invite themselves to have
input from the group and from the
leadership." There are five leaders
in the Grinnell chapter of the orga-
nization; four of these lead Bible
study groups and one serves as an
emcee of sorts for the weekly larger
group meetings.

The emcee position was the one
from which the aforementioned stu-
dent resigned. Miller and Pallas ex-
plained that leadership in
InterVarsity requires a personal re-
lationship with the Bible. which for
them entails believing in the authors
ily of the Scripture. “We can’t,"
Pallas said. “say anything other than
what we believe because it becomes
a part of who we are,"

Mason ‘99, an active member of
InterVarsity, came forward to no
knowledge that his beliefs differ
from those ofthe leadership regard
ing the sinfulness ofhomosexuality.
He explained, “Just because the
leadership says this does not mean
everyone agrees with this position.
Whether it’s a sin or not, God made
everyone the way they are, and God
will watch over them and protect
them."

Some students who are notafﬁli-
ated with InterVarsity raised cone
cerns, which reached SGA at the
Joint Board meeting on Wednesday
night, that requiring leaders to sign
a form in which they affirm that they
implicitly denounce homosexuality
as a sin might Violate the college’s
nondiscrimination policy.

According to the college’s
199637 Student Handbook, “The
college does not discriminate on
the basis of race, color, religion,
gender, national origin, disability,

age, and sexual orientation in ad-
ministration of any of its educa
tional policies or programs, includ
ing admission, financial aid, and
athletics."

While InterVarsity is a national
organization, the Grinnell chapter is
an official student group. Meaning:
the Grinnell Chapter is registered
with the college and qualiﬁes to ap-
ply for funding from SGA as well
as other amenities provided for regr
istered student groups.

Groups cannot receive funding
from SGA for religious events, but
they can receive funding for other,
non—religious, group-sponsored ac-
tivities. Concerned students feel that
lnterVarstty's possible noncomplir
ance with the college’s nondiscrimia
nation policy is in conflict with
InterVarsity's status as a registered
student group.

lnterVarsiiy does not openly de-
nounce homosexuality and homOA
sexuals are accepted members ofthe
group, according to current leader
ship, The controversy is in specific
regard to the Statement of Agree-
ment group leaders must sign.

The group's current leader's be-
lieve that because the Bible, in their
opinion, explicity denounces homo-
sexuality, any speaker or Bible study
group leader should assent to this
“Biblical truth."

Anna Carney, hired by the na-
tional InterVarsity Christian Fel-
lowship to be the adviser for the
Grinnell and UNI chapters, 35*
seried: “We [the national organir
zalion] take a moral stance against
homosexuality... We believe that
sexuality is something that isn't
just a physical act but also has to
do With the soul, but God puts con-
straints on how and when it should
be expressed."

When asked, Carney agreed that
the current situation regarding lead-
ership and views on homosexuality
has caused tension. “This has been,"
she said calmly, “a particularly tense

led many languagesincluding Greek,
Swahili, Czech. Polish, Italian,Japa»
nese, Hebrew and Portuguese.

Cross has been involved nationr
ally in selfstudy language programs,
particularly as a member of the Na
tional Association of Self Instructed
Languages Program,

According to Associate Dean
Helen Scott, "This has been a very
Successful program. We are lucky to
have a director who is very knowl»
edgeablc about self study language
programs and who is active at the
national level of such programs,"

InterVarsity, continued from page 1

time," However, she also said,
“We’re an interdenominational
group. For that reason, I‘m not sure
the group has ever been cohesive,"

Miller implied that cohesion of
the group was one motivation that
might have inﬂuenced the recent res-
ignation. “I think the issue is she
offered to resign because she didn’t
want to be in conflict. It was pain-
ful,“ Miller confessed. Accepting
the resignation, however, Miller
confirmed was “a unanimous deci»
sion ofthe leadership."

The group brought in a mini5r
ter, Reverend Sherman Brown,
from the Des Moines Shiloh szr
tist Church on Tuesday night and
seemed relieved at the success of
the evening, Most of the group
was present, as was the student
who recently resigned her leader
ship position.

Reverend Brown reiterated the
national organizations message in
his sermon: “The Bible is God's
word!" He also preached that
”God's word is wholesome, pure, to
the point."

Chaplain Deanna Shorb. who at
tended Tuesday night‘s meeting, is
aware of the current controversy and
explained that while she does have
an opinion regarding homosexuality
and Christianity, she will wait to ad
dress the situation until those in
volved have received opportunities
to express their perspectives to the
campus at large.

Carney said that the question of
sexual orientation does not cause
this sort of strife within many other
InterVarsity chapters around the
country.

That it has come up at Grinnell is
not surprising to most Grinnell stu-
dents, considering the college
community's history of openness
and liberalness regarding sexual ori—
entation. InterVarsity continues at
this point to wrestle with this queSr
lion and the resulting dissent within
their organization.
