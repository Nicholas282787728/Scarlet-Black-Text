The country- n£ Czechoslovakia l
is now‘ represented on the Grin-l

nell campus by.an’ attractiveI
coed, Desanka Pavlu. ‘Desanka,
is ’24 years old, sl 5" Fall
very personable; ‘and quite
happy with «her new environ-
‘ment,-

Desanka left her homeland in
July, 1950, atter having studied
law ior four years at Charles
University in' Prague. She went
to Austria, which was under
less pressure by the Com-
mun'ssts, and remained there in
salsburg until March, 1951,

"when she went to Munich, Ger-
many. She remained there until
December, when the nlmbus or
red tape was ,tinally cleared:-
For the past two weeks she
has, been in the‘l United states.

Desanka would like to remain
at Grinnell until- she acquires a
liberal arts degree. English- will
be ,her greatest hindrance, since
she, has had a comparatively
'small amount of Systematic‘

She explained that anyone
taking lessons in English in
Czechoslovakia was considered
‘to be preparing himself for‘es»
cape. Desanka did, however,
learn a great deal of English
