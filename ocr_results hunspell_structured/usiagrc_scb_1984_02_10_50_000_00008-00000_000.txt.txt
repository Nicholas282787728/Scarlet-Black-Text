Jim Bloyd examines daily life in Nicaragua

The following story was sent to
the Scarlet and Black from
Managua by reporter Jim Bloyd.
who is currently working as a
registered nurse in the
Nicaraguan capital city. He left
for Nicaragua at the end of
December to volunteer in the cof-
fee harvest, but has done much
more than just pick coffee beans.

Bloyd. who was enrolled as a
Junior at Grinnell last semester,
originally planned to stay in
Nicaragua for the Christmas
vacation. He has since decided to
remain in Managua until at least
springtime, but has promised to
return to Grinnell with
photographs and many stories to
tell.

tirely different lifestyle and a

A group of so us, citizens left
Miami Dec. 18 and arrived in
Managua, Nicaragua to jam
similar groups from Germany,
Denmark, Costa Rica, Italy.
Nowary, Bolivia, Sweden. Austria
and France, who were volunteers
ing their labor to help bring in the
coffee harvest. The U.S. con-
tingent, organized by The Na-
tional Network in Solidarity with
The Nicaraguan People, in
Washington, D.C.. included
students, bus drivers, construc-
tion workers and profasionals,
ranging in age from 19 to 72.

We came from all over the U.S.:
Vermont, New York, Illinois,
Texas, Iowa, California, Penn-
sylvania, Massachussetts. to
name only a few of the states
represented. All of the ‘internar
cionalistas', as we were called,
spent the next 21/ weeks making
friends, listening to speakers and
picking coffee.

Soon after we arrived, we
organized ourselves into brigades
of to people each with a ‘respone
sable', whose main qualification
was an ability to speak Spanish.
Later, we were split up and went
to pick coffee in different U.P.E.‘s
(Unitad dc Production Estatal),
those are small farm estates, As
the ‘responsable’ for the “Paul
Robeson" brigade, I had many
duties. I spent time collecting lists
of names for airline reservations,
list of,material aid that people
brought, list of medicine that we
had, and later translating the ins
terviews and discussions that we
had with leaders of the ATC
(Association of Farm Workers),
the Juventud Sandinista (San-
dinista Youth), and the Ad—
ministration of the U.P.E. where
we were, and other planned or imr
promptu meetings.

I smyed at “El Chaguiton,”
U .P.E., housing 3 brigades, so km
from the Honduran border. I
helped the other two brigade
leaders, Sarah Matthews, a
worker in a brick factory from
Seaside, Calif, and Jesus San-
chez,, a Colombian studying in
NYC. We worked together to calm
frayed nerves and relay instruc-
tions from the capatazes. the per-
manent campesino crew leaders
who supervised the harvest of the
rojito. or “litte red bean”. _

Our’ days at “El Chaguiton"
started at sunrise, as people
struggled out of ther rooms of the
corachas, the long solid wooden
buildings that had seven rooms on
each side, each with two wooden
bunkbeds and no mattresses. We

ticipated in press conferences, at—
tended lectures. discussion and in
tervicwed Nicaraguan citizens.

Bloyd was also interviewed by
The Guardian newsweekly, a na
tional publication which is
distributed on campus. In the in-
terview. Bloyd was asked about
the recent terrorist attacks by
c.l:A.-supported counters
revolutionaries. He was quoted as
saying “We cannot believe that
the U.S. people would support this
type of activity. [They] are being
misled.”

In a letter to the Scarlet and
Black. Bloyd noted that he will
most definitely be coming back to
campus, and mat he will bring the
coffee ordered by Grinnell
students with him.

lived alongside campesinos (the
workers who lived and worked on
the small farms) as well as some
of the 500 high school volunteers
from the city of Chinandega. After
eating a breakfast of frijules, rice,
and tortillas with hot coffee, we
walked 1 or 2 kms. to the place
where we would cut coffee that
day,

There is definitely skill involved
in harvesting coffee. The eXr
perienced campesinos cut up to 10
latas a day of the ripe, sweet
beans, and do so leaving the green
stems intact on the branch. Less
experienced workers stripped the
branch, which would not produce
as many beans next year. A lata
comes from the word for the
square, 5 gallon oil cans that were
originally used to measure the
coffee. Each worker carried a
canasta. or basket tied to ﬂ'le
waist. When the Canasta Wastill-
ed. we emptied it into large sacks
that weigh 100 pounds when full.
The sacks were gathered at the
end of the day and transported by
truck to the U.P.E.

The distant sound of a pickup at
midday meant lunch, and the
discipline of hacienda fila, waiting
in line, characteristic of all bus
stops and other gatherings, in
Nicaragua, was forgotten as the
hungry campesinos and student
volunteers clamored for food 7
beans, rice, and tortillas, and the
fresco, a Sweet fruit drink that
varied from day to day.

All this took place under a
canopy of rich. green foliage,
which protects the coffee plans
from the direct rays of the sun. We
lounged, taking adavantage of the
moment of relaxation to chat with
members of the militia, who pick
ed coffee with riﬂes slung over
their shoulders. Because of the at-
tacks by u. sponsored counter-
revolutionar es of coffee
harvesters. Nicaraguans often
play a double role of production
and military defense.

The news on the day we left
Managua for the U.P.E. that 14
campesinos. including 2 children,
had been killed by the “Contra’s”
emphasized to us the importance
of alertness, discipline and
organization. Also, we re
examined what the government of
our country was doing, Many of
our group for the first time realiz-
ed with horror the true nature of
the U.S. efforts to ovethrow the
Sandinista government, when
they heard of the massacre.

After lunch, a new round of
picking began, Often we
scrambeld up steep slopes, trying
not to spill any of the fruit we had

worked so hard to pick. Moments
of solitude were mixed with song
and conversation, as we slowly
made our way through the rows of
coffee plants.

The end of the day was annouch
ed first in Spanish, and spread
through the forest in German and
English. The oldest members of
our group. Regina Postun, a does
tor (age 65), and Bert Muhly,
former mayor of Santa Cruz, often
hitched a ride back in the truck
which transported the coffee.

Around 4 pm, while tired
pickers showered, washed
clothes, or attended to their col»
oradillas (the tiny red sores that
formed around the waist and can
make sleep impossible if not dous-
ed with alcohol), the coffee
harvested that day was being
measured. La medida. as it is call-
ed, is an important part of the
day. The huge sacks of coffee are
carried up to the top of the
dcspuipadora. where the coffee'
begins the 4day process that
resutls in exportable, grovo de
ora. or “gold". The freshly picked
beans are dumped into a compart-
ment with lines on the side marks
ing the quantity in iatas. When
full, the compartment holds 4
latas. A lever dumps the beans in-
to a chute leading to a machine
that removed the outer skin. The
beans then ferment in a large
tank, which removed another slip
pery outer layer.

Before the revolution,
campesinos were paid 1 cordoba
per Lata, and were never allowed
to observe the measuring of their
day's labor, Now. campesinos are
paid 10 cordobals per lata, and
anyone who wants to may climb
the steps and witness the measur-
ing.

The F.S.L.N. (Fente Sandinista
de Liberacion Nacional) has
taken concrete steps to improve
the living conditions of
campesinos. The U.P.E. “El
Chaguito.“ formerly a hacienda
owned by pastor Midence, now
residening in Miami, provides ser-
vices that were unheard of before
the triumph of the revolution. .

We visited a free day-care
center that cares for children up
to 6 years of age whose mothers
work in the coffee harvest. In the
closest town, pueblo Nuevo,

where in the past one doctor serv-
ed only those who could pay, there
now exists a new clinic providing
general and special services for
women and children, all for free.

We spoke to campesinos who
learned to read and write. and are
continuing their education
through the Adult Education Pro-
gram, Members of the U.S.
brigade were present at a
ceremony where land titles were
turned over to campesinos, We
also witnessed the release of 5
counter~revolutionaries, under
the new anmesty law. to their
families.

The buildings we lived in were
constructed by the Sandinista
government. Before, campesinos
fended for themselves, sleeplng
on the ground, exposed to the
strong mountain winds that make
the 40 degree temperature seem
more bitter. Though it was hard
for both the Nicaraguan students
from the‘ city and the North
Americans to eat only tortillas,
rice and beans, with salad only oc-
casionally, and meat only on
Christmas, the campesinos told us
that before, rice was unheard of.
The supervisor of our brigade told
us that they enjoy the contact with
their fellow Nicaraguans from the
city and the ‘internacionalistas‘.

The u.s. government under

but'instead rely on terrorism aim-

A week before we arrived at “El
Chaguiton”, a married couple
working in the Adult Educaiton
Program, which teaches
campesinos how to read and
write, was abducted only in km

In April, 1983, the Contras burn»
ed down two buildings at “El
Chaguiton”, destroyed millions of
cordobas worth of tools and
agricultural equipment, as well as
the only radio at the state—owned
farm. Security is tighter now, and
we felt quite Secure knowing that
all of us were protected by at least
100 reservists, in addition to the
patrols of the Popular Sandinista
Army in the surrounding moun-
tains.

At a press conference on the
morning of our return, the whole
group, which included ex-CIA
agent Phillip Agee, expressed
their appreciation for the warm
welcome we received at all points
of the journey, and demanded a
halt to the us, aggression.

As one who has experienced the
resentment of some Colombians
and Mexicans who viewed me as a
gringo representing the U.S.
government, I can testify to the
fact that the people truly view the
U.S. government as a dangerous
intruder. For many reasons this
still amazes me.

While U.S. citizens do not need a
visa of any torm to travel in
Nicaragua, the U.S. denies or in—
hibits the visits of Nicaraguans,
including key government of
ficials. The U.S. government sup-
ported the Somoza regime from
the beginning, and now funds
groups of Somocista guards who
can only he described as terrorist
mercenaries.
