Q

KDlC-rM has almost exhausted
its funds to cover its Associated
Press news service, and station of-
ficials say legal considerations will
probably force the station to suspend
its operations when the teleprinter
service ends.

Chief Engineer John Hansen ex-
plained that iederal law requires
all broadcast stations to maintain a
constant link to the Emergancy Br»

*Oadcast System (EES).

This link may be accomplished
through a teleprinter, which KDIC
uses, or through a special EES re»
ceiver, which KDIC does not have.

Hansen says that EBS receivers
are ditticult to acquire, and that to
operate KDIC without either tele»
printer or receiver would clearly be
illegal. 4 ,

'3 Sexuality Discussed

l
by Deborah Redman
A dialogue on “Being Male and
Female” was presented to about
300 people by Dr. Evalyn Gendel
and Dr. W. Walter Menninger Tues»
day night in Roberts Theatre The
program, sponsored bythe College’s
sex education committee, covered
aspects of human sexuality ranging
from homosexuality to promiscuity.
While not intended as a face dis-
emination period, the dialogue did
provide some interesting insights
into the nature of certain sexual
behavior. At one point, the example
was given of people who use physi-
cal closeness to escape the respo-
nsibility of emotional closeness.
Homosexuality provided a topic

for serious discussion, while the'

myths about masturbation supplied
Comic relief. Humor also took the

. lorm or jokes, puns, and an ex—
tremely well~received excerpt from
Eric Burn’s book Sex and Human
Loving.

Pointing to medical students “who
still have all kinds of confused ideas
about what the realities are,” Dr.
Menninger stressed the widespread
need for sexual re-education. This
idea was a recurrent them through—
out the dialogue. '

To illustrate certain points, case
histories of patients were some~
_times discussed, Dr. Menninger told
of a young man with homosexual
tendencies who struggled a long
time before,realizing that others
shared his problems.

This man had not actually had a
homosexual relationship until after
he was married and his wife be»
came pregnant. Mentioned. too, was
a girl who had been sleeping with
so many men that she didn’t know

we can operate very far into Sep»
tember, given the current condi»
tions”, he added.

station Manager Dale Scherler has
been working for several months on
alternate sources of money tor the
news service, but so far hits been
unable to find the needed funds,

“It is really too much money for
the present budget. It's a lot of
money to us, but to the people that
give grants to the College, it is
too small to worry, about",he noted.

Scherler said that every effortwill
be made to keep KDIC operating
on its full 20 hour per day sche»
dule for as long as possible, but
he was not optimistic.

"I hope we can get to, the end of
the month (September), but actually,
i agree with John...we probably
can’t continue like this too much

who was the father of her unborn
child.

Sexual stereotypes were also dealt
with. The recent seductionand mur-
der of teenage boys in Texas was
held up as the image many people
have of homosexual activities.

Dr. Menninger said ”I think it is
the greater sin in terms of secur—
ity clearance in the federal govern-
ment to be identitied as having any
kind of homosexual tendencies than
it is to be a member of the Comm»
unist party, although they’re both
pretty bad stuf ." Dr. Gendel closed
the dialogue with the reading of a
satirical paper which supposed the
complete reversal of the traditional
American sex roles.

Dr. Gendel expressed concern
about the student reaction to the
dialogue. She said the students “se-
emed to have expected a more in-
formational type lecture.” She had
also hoped to have aimore open
discussion of personal feelings dur»
ing the small group meetings which
were held Tuesday evening and Wed»
nesday morning.

Both members ofthe dialogue came
well qualified for the discussion.
Dr. Gendel is Director of the Div-
ision of Maternal and Child Health
of the Kansas State Department of
Health. She also serves as Presi-
dent of the Sex Information and Ed-
ucation Council oftheU.S.(SlECUS).
Dr. Menninger is staff Psychiatrist
of The Menninger Foundation, To-
peka, Kansas. He is presently a
Consultant to the US Bureau of
Prisons as well as a member of the

sory Panel on Prison Facilities,

’ Boards Rescue Dark TV’s

by John i‘urnbull
Major topics considered during
Wednesdays Joint Board meeting
were the Television Fund, the ap-
propriation of a little more money
for KDIC , the funding of the James
Hall Faculty Residence Fund and the
,stablishment or an ad hoc commit-
tee to investigate the Health Center.
Most of the discussion at the meet»
ing concerned the Television Fund,
The campus has been without any
money to fix T.V. sets since the end
of last semester and the SGA Tre»
asurer's Finance Committee sug»
gested that a “pass the hat" coll»
ection be made.
¢However, after Wednesday night’s
action, those televisions that pre—
sently reciprocate the blank stares
of Star—Trek fans will be cured of
their afflictions by the money rai»
sea from a campus lottery (to be
held within the week) and a campus
“carnival" to be held soon after.
Drizes for the lottery have yet to
9 determined.

'ester proves successtul,

ln other action, the Boards app»
ropriated $275 from the General
Budget and Reserve (GnoR), Of
this, $175 was given KDIC towards
the purchase of a new $1600 control
board. .
The other $100 went to fund the
expected food expenses of the Ja-
mes Hall Faculty Residence. The
program will allow professors and
their families to live on campus
(i.e. James Hall) ”for one week or
as long as they can take it,” which-
ever comes first, If this first sem»
funding
for succeeding semesters will be
taken over by the College Adminis—
tration, /
A potentially major issue for later
in the year will be the ad hoc Com»
mittee to investigate the Health
Center. It promises to be a semes-
ter in which the Health Center will
be under organized scrutiny with a
minor intent being the institution
practical and popular reforms. SGA
is still looking for people who want
to join this struggle.

KDIC Future In Question

longer.”
Public what?

However, the station still faces
long term problems, even if the
teleprinter is replaced with an EBS
receiver.

KDlC‘is tacing an application tor
renewal of its operating license,
The license charges the station
to operate in the “public convenience
and necessity", a phrase requiring
the station to serve the public.

Hansen noted that without an im»
mediate source of news and espec»
ially weather information, it was
doubtful that KDIC could be Said to
be fulfilling its license obligations.

“We really have to have a current
source oi iniormation, especially
weather, because it is so change-
able in Iowa”, said Hansen, a Des
Moines native,

Station officials were meeting with
student and administration leaders
in an effort to find a viable solution
to the problem.

It was incorrectly reported
in last week’s Scarlet and El»
ack that Mayor rloyd Beaver
was undecided about his future
political plans.

After the mayor talked to our
reporter, but prior to publica»
tion, Beaver announced that he
will seek a Sixth term in the
November 6 election.

by John Wylie

DES MOINES—»IowaSenatorl-larold
Hughes announcedhere early'l‘hul‘s-
day that he Will not seek a second
term.

The surprise announcement app-
ears to enhance the chances of
Republican Governor Robert Ray
should he choose to run for the
Senate in 1974, a possibility that
has been widely discussed.

Hughes says he is retiring from
political life to devote his time to
religious lay work in two founda-
tions, the Fellowship Foundation
of Washington, DC. and the Inter-
national Christian Leadership gr—
cup.

In making his announcement, Hu-
ghes said his new role would pre-
sent a new kind of challenge in a
troubled world, Hughes has long
been a lay reader in the Methodist
Church, and has been noted for his

politics.

Hughes entered politics in 1960
as an unsuccessful candidate for
the Democratic gubenatoriai nom»
ination He won both the nomina»
tion and the governorship in 1962,
defeating incumbent Republican No-
rman Erbe.

He won again in 1964 by the lar-
gest Democratic margin in lowa
political history after his efforts
towards repealing the lowa lnw pro-
hibiting liquor by the drink.

as usual. Recent financial disclosures did not intertere with scheduling
or student announcers for the past week.

. Hughes: Out Of Politics

Hughes was elected to a third
term by a 100,000 vote plurality
in 1966 despite a strong Republi»
can tide.

He was elected to the Senate in
1968, and was prominently men»
tioned as a Democratic Presidential
possibility in the 1972 elections.

Hughes' announcement came as a
surprise to most Iowa political ob»
servers, who had been relishing a
possible race between Hughes and
Robert Ray, the two top vote»gett»
ers in recent lowa history,

Ray said Hughes' announcement
“leaves all of us in lowa politics,
regardless of party loyalties, with
a ieeling l can best describe as a
mixture of surprise and respect.”

IN WASHINGTON, Iowa's Junior
Senator, Dick Clark, described Hu-
ghes as a man with a "long and

distinguished career in govern»

ment."

He added that, although some may
have disagreed with Hughes' stands
on particular issues, he knew oi no
one in either lowa or Washington
who did not respect Hughes as a
man of deepest convictions and high»

SGA Releases

Referendum
Results

Both amendments to the SGA con-
stitution were overwhelmingly ap-
proved in a referendum election
Tuesday.

Amendment 1, which abolished the
position of House Vice—President
and replaced it with the position
of House Coordinator was passedby
a 433 to 49 margin.

A second amendment, which modi»
fled the requirements for represen»
tatives of the college owned off»
campus houses was passed by a 432
to 51 margin.

A total of 493 ballots, represent»
ing about one-third of the student
body, were cast. or these, eleven
were marked as abstentions in the
first section, while seven absten»
tions were recorded in the second
ballot.

Clark says he wishes Hughes well
in his new ventures.

IN GRINNELL, where Hughes has
visited many times as a lecturer
and supporter of other Democratic
candidates for office,- reaction cen—
tered on shock and dismay.

Ed Gilmour, professor of political
science and First District Committ-

. eeperson. on the Democratic State

Central Committee, said of Hughes,
”the Democratic party, the state,
and the nation will be poorer with»
out his strong leadership,”
Although Gilmour had some ad-
vance knowledge of Thursday's an»
nouncement, he expressed dismay
that Hughes was leaving the,poli-
tical scene.

Looking towards the future, he said

Harold Hughes was n frequent '
visitor to Grimell. See page 6.

the Democratic party will need a
strong, dynamic candidate for 1974
it it is to retain the Hughes seat.

Gilmour said he fully expects that.
Governor Robert Ray will run tor
Hughes’ Seat.

Possible Democratic candidates
mentioned by Gilmour include the
members of Iowa’s Congressional
delegation and Nicholas Johnson,
former federal Communications Co-
mmissloner,

Johnson, he said, would be espe—
cially attractive to young voters be»
cause he is a populist who was
active in promoting many populist
issues while a member of the FCC.
Area Republican leader William
Vanderpool could not be reached tor
comment on the Hughes decision.
Senator Joan Orr (D»Grinnell) was
also unavailable at press time.
