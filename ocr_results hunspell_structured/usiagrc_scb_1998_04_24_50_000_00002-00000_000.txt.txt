lations, self governance, communi-
cation, and the future of Grinnell
dominated the discussions. Also, stu»
dents asked each candidate why he
or she applied for presidency at
Grinnell.

In response to the latter question.
Hurwitz began, “I‘ve been Watching
Grinnell for many years, and I’ve
been very impressed. So when I
heard that there was a possibility that
I might be considered, I thought. I’d
like to be involved in this." She went
on to say that because she was coma
mitted to liberal arts education and
institutional diversuy, she and the
college would make “a good match."

Flynn also responded to the ques-
tion. listing reasons he was drawn to
the Search. Such reasons included
Grinnell’s “clarity of mission," enr
compassing a commitment to under
graduate, liberal arts. and residential
education. Also. Flynn noted the

consider."

Emmett twice asked for exception
to academic policy due to an emo-
tionally traumatic event which oc-
curred during his semester abroad.
He was refused the first time, and is
awaiting the reply to the second,

Emmett sees faults with student
representation at hearings for ap-
peals: “I asked both times ifI could
be present at the CAS review of my
case and they said no. Why? ‘It's
policy.’ I believe that students should

be allowed to participate in every part
of the appeals process." He suggests

a board olappeals. comprised offacA
ulty and students. which would hear
the appeals in person.

Asher commented on the lack of
student representation in appeals pro-
cesses: “[lt] takes away from the stu-
dents. . .and assumes that we can’t
be responsible for ourselves and
make the right decisions.”

Emmett also saw a fault with eq-
uity in the process: ”Equity involves
consideration on an individual ham

college's potential influence on the
national conversation about higher
education. “This is a moment in
Grinnell's history,,.when it’s asking
fundamental questions about What it
means to be a [leading college]."
Flynn saw a need for “significant
national leadership from liberal arts
colleges...zind Grinnell is the kind of
place that lends itselfto that."

A second question asked of each
candidate Was what he or she bcr
lieved constituted a “top college.“

l-Iurwitz responded that a sense of
excellence is “not always related to
what is in magazines." She ex-
plained that “that does not mean [one
should disregard conventional mea
sures of excellence such as] faculty
to student ratios and talent in the stu-
dent body." However. “Grinnell
must find its own answer. It is not
ridiculous to say, ‘How can we mean
Sure [success]?'... We must ﬁnd in

into a category."

Dean Crady felt that students are
treated fairly by CAS: “It’s pretty
sensitive to student needs, although
some students may disagree with
that. I think the committee looks at
each case fairly. . .each student case
is so different.”

Yet, many students felt their cases
were not judged fairly. A senior who
wished to remain anonymous said,
"Often decisions are made by com-
mittees which only have a partial
View. . ,[a numerical fact such as]
G.P.A. doesn't necessarily reﬂect a
student’s ability."

Emmett questioned the purpose
for an appeals process: ”The point. .
.is to bolster equity. yet it seems the
school is doing exactly the opposite.
. .[the appeals process] seems to be
nothing more than a bureaucratic for-
mality which makes the school ap-
pear equitable."

Asher was disconcerted by the ap-
peals’ treatment of students: “It
makes me feel like the things I was
told about when Iapplied to Grinnell
are a lie,”

dicators to address the [task of] be-
coming the best we can possibly
be.,,without corrupting our soul."

Flynn also said, “Some U.S.
World News and Reports ratings
have nothing to do with quality [be-
cause they measure] prestige and
status....Looking only at a magazine
[to measure success] is a recipe for
disaster... [However] looking only in-
ternally is also a recipe for disaster."
Flynn stressed deﬁnition ofcore val-
ues and cross departmental ways of
evaluating strength.

mon Courage Press, 1996). Danaher will present his pas-
sionate critique of corporate globalization this weekend on

cation and action center working to promote citizen diplo-
