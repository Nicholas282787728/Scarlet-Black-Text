Ernest SetoneThompson.

Besides being an exceedingly
interesting lecturer, Ernest Seton
Thompson is a naturalist, an
artist, and an authori He has
' achieved distinction and success
in these three directions; and each
of the three elements contributes
towards making hisanimal stories
and lectures extremely fascinat-

ing. .
Mr. Thompson ﬁrst came to
public notice by the publication
of a book on "The Birds of Mani-
toba,” another on “The Mammals
of Manitoba.” These were well
received by men of science and
brought to their Author an ap-
pointment to the position of
government naturalist to Maui-
toba. His work also came to the
attention ofthe century Company
who engaged him to prepare the
drawings of birds and animals for
the Century Dictionary.

This accomplished, he went to
England and was given a scholar
ship entitling him to seven years’
free tuition in the Royal Academy,
He was not satisﬁed there, how»
ever. and after eighteen months
went to Paris, where he studied
art with Henry Mosier. His ﬁrst
picture was painted within a year
after his arrival there. The sub-
ject was taken from his wolf hunt—
ing experiences in America, and
the picture was exhibited in a con-
spicuous place in the Salon; as
were also his eighteen other draw~
ings and paintings that followed.
These were all wolf pictures; from
which fact the artist came to be

 

popularly
Thompson.

The next four yearsMr. Thump»
son devoted conscientiously to the
preparation of his most important
scientiﬁc work, “The Art Anato~
my of Animals.” This work has
proved invaluable to scientists,
and is considered by them the
ﬁnest thing of its kind ever done
in America, not even second to
the great Audubon,

Recently Mr. Thompson ishav-
ing wide recognition on account
of his stories of the life, habits
andintelligenceotanirnals,stories
which he himself illustrates. A
number ot these stories ﬁrst ap-
peared in the magazines, but
afterwards have been brought out
in very artistic book form. For
help in this direction Mr. Thomp-
son, and the public as well, has
been much indebted to Mrs.

known as “Wolf"

Grace Gallatin Thompson, who,

by training and instinct is able to
enter sympathetically into her
husband’s aims. Mrs. Thompson
is herself the author of a book of
outdoor life entitled, "A Woman
Tendeitoot,” which has just this
month been issued by Doubleday,
Page & Co.

The subject of Mr. Thompson's
lecture to be given here is “The
Personality ot wild Animals."
and it will be illustrated with the
stereopticon from pictures, many
of them of his own taking.

Iowa and Grinnell,

For several reasons it is to be
regretted that the delegation of
r50 that went to Iowa City this
forenoon could not have been
doubled or trebled. While noth-
iug could be more certaintthan
that the eleven will meet over-
whelming defeat, that is one of
thestrongest reasons whyitshould
receive loyal support, With Cape
tain Douglass, Deignan and Felr
lows out of the game, Grinnell can
make but a weak showing at best.
The most the team can be asked
to do is to make it's usual plucky
ﬁght.

But there are other than partisan
reasons why all who possibly can
should see Iowa play football this
fall. Our university has certainly
the greatest eleven that ever
played in the Hawkeye state, it
not the greatest the West has ever

 

seen. Such teams are not annual
occurrences. Iowa will never
again be a weakling in football,
but it is reasonably certain that
she will not soon have a team
whose record will stand compari-
son with that of 1900. Those who
have been able to see this human
machine in action are indeed to be
counted fortunate, regardless of
the result of today’s contest,

It is hoped that the men will
not be too badly crippled by
Iowa’s battering attack. With
reasonable luck in this direction,
the team will be able to pull to-
gether for a hard ﬁght against
Drake on Thanksgiving Day. The
odds are doubtless much in
Drake’s favor, but Grinnell should
not be counted out entirely.

The Rev. Mr. Steiner.

Rev. Steiner. who delivered an
informal series of two lectures in
the college this week, is a most
interesting personage. He is a
native of Vienna went through
the German Gymnasium and took
his doctor's degree. At the age
of twenty came to America and,
by chance, grew interested in
Oberlin College. He did some
tutoring in the college, at the
same time enteringthe Theologicr
al Seminary, from which he grade
uated three years later. He is at
present pastor of the ﬁrst Congier
gational Church of Sandusky,
Ohio. His services as special
correspondent are in regular de-
mand by The Outlook and other
of the ﬁrst class periodicals,

His talk on Tolstoi, a brief
resume of which appeared in the
last issue, was especially interest.
ing. His subject Wednesday
night was ”The Slav’I. such men
are always welcome to Grinncll.
More of them would be appreci-
ated, we are sure, by the college.
