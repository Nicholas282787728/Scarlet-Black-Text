AMELS are never parched or toasted

HAVE you noticed the new trend in cigarettes?—
freshness is the popular thing.

That’s because a fresh cigarette, as demonstrated
by Camels, is something smokers have discovered as
better than anything they ever tried before.

Camels are fresh in the Camel Humidor Pack be-
cause they’re made fresh to start with — blended of
choice, delicately mild, sun-ripened tobaccos in which
the natural moisture and fragrant‘ﬂavots are vigi-
lantly safeguarded. ‘

The tohaccos in Camels are never parched or toasted
— the Reynolds method of scientiﬁcally applying heat

guarantees against that.

That’s why we say with so much assurance that
Camels are truly fresh. Theyire made fresh—not
parched or toasted—and then they’re kept fresh in
the Camel Humidor Pack.

Try Camels’ freshness for a change. Switch over
for just one day, then change back — if you can.
