Gripping Hard or Hard/y Glipfmg?

Dear “Gripping",

Well, the good news for you is that this almost certainly
is not an STI! Unless he is experiencing other standard STI
symptoms (itching, burning, redness, rash, etc.) he probably is
simply surrering from a very common problem. Your sources
are indeed correct— gripping very hard during masturbation
can decrease penile sensitivity and consequentially make it dift
ﬂcult to get orrityou are engaging in an activity (with or with
out a partner) that holds onto the penis less tightly than you
are used to.

There are several diirerent ways that you might try remedy-
ing this solution. First, do not masturbate without some sort of
lotion or cream, especially if you are uncircumcised. Not only
does it decrease sensation, it can also lead to very unpleasant
penile chaﬁng that puts your penis completely out ofcommist
sion for quite a whilel We sell packets of lube at the sexual
Health Information Center, but you can also invest in various
masturbation oils and creams, available online, or at sex shops
(check out the Lion's Den a few miles West on 1780 for a good
selection!).

Also, you and your partner should be conscientious about
gripping less rightly, and gradually he will get used to getting
ofl'wlthout what is affectionately known in some sexual health

circles as “The Iron Vise Grip otMasturbatory Death." After
a little while, you and your boyriiend should be enjoying set
where he gets off easily, and everybody is experiencing masti-
inum penile sensation,

it sounds like you and your boyfriend have been Commu-
nicating well about this, but it is also important to be frank
with partners about whiIt is comfortable for youl With a little

aged, or become thin or weak, you ean start reeling dissatisﬁed
with your vaginal tone. This ring of muscles contracts during
an orgasm and mav arrest the intensity you experience These
muscles also naturally net weaker as you get older (giving birth
vaginally can also weafen the muscles).

Well, the good thing is that iryou're unhappy about the
strength otyour vaginal muscles, there are ways to improve it!

 

switching up or your routines and
honest communication about how
you are both reeling in terms ofscxt
ual pleasure, you should be out otrhc

Dealt Laure,

Vaginas come in a miel‘y of sizeﬁveryone's is different
and it is hard to generalize about site. However, there have
been a few studies done about this topic. one study found
that an unstimulated vagina (vaginas generally expand when
stimulated or aroused) had an average length of about 2% 3%
inches. and about a 3/t inch width at the back of the vagina.
When stimulated. the average lengths increased to 4-6 inches,
and the width at the back of the wagina increased to 2 V2 to 3 1/1
inchCSﬁabout a 40 percent increase

You’re probably not worried about vaginal length, though.
You’re probably more worried about the width of your vagina.
See, the way it works is that there is a ring of muscles surrounds
ing the lower third of the vagina. if these muscles get dam-

creased muscle tone.
But it is more likely
that you are simply more aroused when your vagina reels less
tight And there is definitely no chance that having more sex
will lead to a ‘”looser vagina, since the vagina is muscle, and it
doesnt make sense to suggest that the more you use a muscle,
the less firm it would become

Love always-

Gjesdahl weighs in on abortion: “there’s no one answer”

Editor} Note: Due ti; 2}” renriti-ue nature oft/m irrxiz, 2}]:
SEE would like to reiterate [our ﬂ): view: afraiumrlilli in 7117 may
reﬂect the wewx e/tbr 8&3 1171:1117: rm ig/rlm 3'ij in:

While walking through the loggia on the day that I had to
write my article, I saw a poster which said that “the best counter
to the antitabortion movement is the truth.” With all due re-
specr,l had this statement condescending and false. The points
they make on the posters are truchmaking abortion illegal ens
dangers the lives orpregnant women who get illegal abortions,
a large percentage orwomen have unintended pregnancies and
contraception could prevent unmnted pregnancies. Unfortu-
nately, none of this has anything to do With the argument of
prorlirers. Pro—liters are not arguing
about the convenience of abortion
being illeglithey are arguing that
murder should be illegal. Before I
go any further, I'd like to say that
I'm neither pro-choice nor prorlire.
rather I want to point out that the
ﬂaws in this debate and propose
a solution. Some societies ban all
abortion and contraception while
others allow lnfﬂntlcld57l do not
see it as my place to judge, It may
seem that I am arguing more against protchoice arguments,
but that is because most students are prorchoice and I don't
see the need to preach to the choir on the beneﬁts oflegalieing
abortion,

The nbott‘lon debate is so acrimonious because the two
sides are talking past each other (and because life is on the line).
One can see this in the names or the std657"pro—chulce" and
“prodlfe.” Ptotlife people are not opposed to a woman having
control over her bodyithey just see a fetus as a dirreient body

rather than a part ota woman's body Pro-choice people are not
against lifeithey just do not see a fetus as a life. Ultimately,
the debate is over when life beginHt conception or birth or
somewhere in between. This is a moral question with no ra-
tionally determinable answer You can say that a fetus is totally
dependent on its mother for life and is therefore not a human
being but things are not as clear-cut as that. A fetus in its third
trimester can survive on life support and a newborn baby is
still highly dependent on its mother—both would surely die
without support, So in fact what we are looking at are degrees
of dependency up to about the age arrive. I do not know or
any societies that practice infanticide after five, which seems to
imply that almost all societies see sixsyearsolds as people.

This is yet another instance of problems stemming from the
belief that there is a universal
truth all societies should abide
by, a totalizing ideology which
opposes the notion that there
can coexist more than one set
of beliefs or customs. Those
who believe that life begins at
conccplmn believe that it is an
absolute truth which cannot
be explained away. Those who
believe that life begins at birth
cannot accept that abortion could in anvway be murder How-
ever, neither of these are universal, scientific truths. Certainly
there are some people with more nuanced views such as those
who see abortion as i kind otmurder that may be worthwhile
since it could iepresent a major inconvenience to the womnn
(especially in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the woinaus life).
However, they are still saying that ii fetus is still not ii full lite, as
most otthem would not bc okay with a mother killing a thrccs
yearsold because it was inconvenient to her Ultimately even

this more nuanced view is still a moral judgment or at what
point inconvenience trumps life. What I propose then is that
Roe v. Wade be repealed and each state he allowed to vote on
at what point abortion on request should be allowediat cont
ception, start of second trimester, beginning of third trimester,
or birth. There would be a runoff between the two categot
ties with the most votes if there were no category with more
than 50 percent or the vote, The same question would also be
asked for when abortion would be allowed in the case ofincest
or tape, and when abortion would be allowed if the woman’s
life was at risk. I think this works best at a state level because
moral opinions vary greatly based on region (ive already stated
my opposition to countries as big as the United States in the
first place). However, this would also work on a national level.
The point is that moral decisions should be made by the people
rather than by 9 old guys

Now to console both sides ofthis debater First to the pros
life people: you were never going to ban all abortion all over
the US anyway According to the Wikipedia page for "abor-
tion in the US," two-thirds of Americans believe that abortion
in the first trimester should be legal and most believe that it
should be legal in the second trimester in cases ofineest, rape,
or risk to the woman. The objections ofthe preschoicers will
be greater because they happen to be in control ofrhe situa-
tion right now. Consider, however, that only the most conser-
vative states (if any) would ban abortion in the first trimester
and even those would probably allow it for the circumstances
above. More states would probably ban abortion (with exceps
rions) in the second trimester, but, according to an article from
the Guttmachcr Institute (wwwguttmacheroig), 88.7 percent
of abortions are in the ﬁrst trimester. so this would have a relat
tively small effect. Also, ifa won-lint really wanted an abortion
she could drive to the nenrestllbetul state, In general, this move
could help Democrats in the polls since many people vote for
Republicans simply beeause they care about abortion
