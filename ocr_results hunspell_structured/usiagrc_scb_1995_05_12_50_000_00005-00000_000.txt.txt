help to explain a rew Illings. This photo or
seniors Matt Haber,.lason Wolrnntl Jon Rose

Two good friends, seniors
Andrea Leonard and Jess Goff,
relax and enjoy at the Hundred
Days- party. Andrea once tried
to make it to State Street every
night ror two weeks, but had to
give up due to illness. Hmmm.
