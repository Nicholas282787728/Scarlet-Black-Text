XOUR MO)E)..

When a protcst was altered in a re
cent issue against the mismanagement
oi the r. M (L A. Lecture Course, many
persons twisted our comment into the
proposition, “Noyes, or no Noyes."
They were mistaken. That was not
the chiet problem we sought to solve.
Our greatest concern was in regard to
“proper management, or mismanager
ment." -

The number of ways in which stu-
dent money is bologimpropcrly ex-
pended are not at all few. We mon-
tioned LLle Noyes lecture as one ni-

‘stance. Now we do not wish to say
anything against the value of Mr.
Noyes lecture because few wlll say it
did not benefit [hell]; but we do think
that some other number would have
been a tar wiser choice on the Lecture
Course. Because it was not the best
choice, in our opinion, we maintain
that there has been an inefficient man-
agement of the Course.

bludranath Tagore, the Hindoo poet,
would have been the best choice is
entirely a matter or personal preter-
cnce, but alter seeing Gl‘lnnell people,
unablc to hear him on the local plat-
l'orm, Journey to Iowa City for that
pl'ivllegc, we cannot help but think
that they would have preferred the
man whose mysticism has attracted
audiences numbering nito the thou-
sands.

Another thing about the Lecture
Course has been the absence of “big"
numbers, that is of men oi national
and \Vol'ldrwlde reputations. These
cost morc, it is two, but they have
been included in other years when the
semester ice apportionment was not so
large as now. Consequently, there is
little reason why they can‘t be obtain»
ed agaln.

The Lecture Course management
has been severely criticised for not
scheduling a number before Clu'lslr
mils. Instead, only one number was
offered for the whole semester. Con—
sequently, one man last week termed
the course “on absolute fizzle” during
the past semester. We don’t lsnow
that We would go so far as to say
that, but we do think the management
erred in not having one or two num-
bers before Christmas.

The management has also worked
itself into the difficulty or putting on
its wholc course in the short space of
two months. Those two months are

 

who would have been better? There ‘

would have been several, but let us

already crowded with musical num-
hci-s, basketball games, debates, suci»
cty‘ banquets and other events. The
least that can be said is that they not
only will have a much more difficult
time in securing dates, but that stue
dcnts will be having so many events
to interest them that they will not
care as much for the management’s
eflorts.

These are not the only things for
which the management has been critv
icised,7ddere are many others; but
laclt of space prevents our enumerate
lug them. They all are illustrations of
the unthinking and unbusincsslihc
methods the management have used in
planning out this year's Lecture
Course. And that means nothing more
or less than that student funds are not
bringing in enough value. If semester
fee holders had inquired into this
sooner, they would have known where
their money was going long before
this.

Announcement ..as made last
week of the interesting fact of the
appearance oi Miss Jessie Christian
in the Auditorium in Chicngo, in
the presentation by the Chicago 0p-
era company ot the opera “Lets- Hue
guenots" by Meyerbeer. Her
friends will be glad to know of the
details regarding her appearance
and of her unqualified success. as
attested by the tact that she was
greeted enthusiastically after each
appearance, receiving seven curtain
calls at the completion of the prinr
ciole arias, also by the tact that
she has been offered a position with
the Opera Company lor next season.
it seems that she did not know that
she was to sing until two o’clock in
the alternoon, being called upon to
take the place at the celebrated
lllme. Gdlli»Curci. It is easy to
imagine that her appearance, under-
these circumstances ivas an extreme
ly ditticnlt and trying one, as she
was called upon at the eleventh
hour, without even an opportunity
to rehearse with the other singers.
The comments of the Chicago pap-
ers on the perlormuuce, were on the
whole, very complimentary.

To the editor: Last Saturday even-
ing Alfred Noycs delivered a lecture
on his poetry, from the rostrum of the
chapel; but one could not help but no.
tiec the way in which he tried to di
credit German ideals, and the way in
which he attempted to spread British
propaganda.

Now Alfred Noyes has a perfect right
to give a pro-British lecture it he
pleases; but what right has he to do so
when he is paid by Americans, whosc
sympathies may be either German or
English, to come here and lecture on
poetry. Does he suppose that one who
‘sympzltlllzes with Germany cares to
pay money] to hear that nation d' -
credited? What would the audience
think if some German were paid to
come here and lecture on Philosophy,
and instead attacked England? Mr.
Noyes takes too much tor granted.

One who believes in lair play.

The Cosmos congratulates The scar-
let and Black staff upon the conven-
tion which they held at Colfax during
the Christmas recess. Judging from
the report we have read of it, the ven-
ture was a. decided success. College
journalism is taking a place of in-
creascd importance, from what it has
held in the past, both as is practical
training for the professiun of journal»
ism and as a student activity, and the
s, 3; B. convention was a step toward
placing it still highcr.—From the Ode
