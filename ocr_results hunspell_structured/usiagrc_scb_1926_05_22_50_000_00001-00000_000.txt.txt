Tyranny never ceases. We just get
rid of the old to usher in the new.
So this Sunday morning, early, as
early as 3:59 a. rn. in fact,
next year‘s League Board will

nity for which they have labored three
years to gain and undergo an impress-
ivc, unforgettable, “informal” initia-
uon to be rcclothsd again in proper
dignity-perfection after the “trial and
error" method.

And at the same time, these ncw
despots are to render great service to
knowledge, to science, to art, as well
as to the general world, The prepar
alions ot one of them will result in the
publication of an invaluable biography
entitled: “Fishworms I Have Known.”
(It is to be noted that no date was

learn that definite figures are now to

rapidly under the direction of Mr.

already been abandoned in some of
the scenes. The large number of exs

The picturesque costumes have
been ordered, and will be correct as

of scenery, and the sets, which will

Special Delivery Business Thrives

al‘d McIlrath, who is ecu-ping his
way through the college by deliver-

and oO-eds.

Almost 6,500 special delivery
letters have been received by Grill-
lieu students this year, un unprece-
dented number, which can be explained
ouly by saying that there is a growing
tendency to have an out-of-towli lover.

Acting as Uunclc Sam's official ile-
livery boy, licllratll has or ricd about
12,000 specials to students and towns-
people, It has kcpt his Fol-fl runabout
busy, but be has received $1,170 for his
work, And for every letter l’CCCchd
ouc is probably sent, so carriers else-
where also profit.

The man who delivcvs specials gels
to pocket most of the money. His
share is cigllt cents on a toll cent
chtor, eleven on a fifteen cent letter,
which is one weighing over two
bounds, and fifteen cents of file twen-
Ly cents necessary to send a special
weighting over ten and under seven-
ty pounds.

prisc of the preliminaries by winning
an easy victory over Sigoloff and Clif-
ford, No. 1 Washington doubles team.
The Bear pair was weak overhead,
and the Pioneers forced thcm into a
string 0! errors. In the second round,
the Griuuell does best Barnes and
Gabbord of the Oklahoma Aggies.

Today they meet Royer and Bran-
denburg, the Oklahoma duet which
won the 1925 title, in the match which
will undoubtedly decide the champion-
ship. If the Grinncll men win, it will
be because of their exceptional vol-

the common people.

Spring is here to such an extend that
Persephone may have to delay her re-
turn to the carth on account of the
