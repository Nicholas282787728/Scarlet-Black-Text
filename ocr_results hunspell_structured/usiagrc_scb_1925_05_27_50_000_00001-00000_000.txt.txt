Showing a strength not credited to
them, the well balanced track team of
Iowa Univcrs rornpcd away for the
sixth sllccessne victory iii the animal
stutc truck and field meet held here
last Saturday. iou ’lllfl Crinncll had
been expected to n h closely but
the Bresualran men piled up a totnl of
74 1-2 points against ii counted by
the Pioneers, Aules scored 26, Drake
is 1»2, Gas 7 and Cornell 3.

Ideal weather, except for a slight
wind blowing across the track made
the meet fast and partially accounted
for the four new meet records that
were hung up. oi-tlicl Roberts, color--
ed Uni ersi of Iowa star started the
record breaking when he stepped the
220 in 21 3710 seconds against the old
record of 21 5-10 made by Charles
Hoyt of Grinnell in 1911;. Roberts al—
so equaled the meet record ‘of ii 340
heldiointly by Rush and Hoyt of
Grinnell.

Chan Coulter anothcr lowa star and
member of last year's Olympic team
equaled a mark that has stood since
1894 when he stepped the quarter in
49 seconds flat. R. L. Whitley oi Grin-
nell who is the holder of this record
was in the stands watching the per--
formance of Condor last Saturday dull
cheered him as he swept up the

‘ straightaway to the finish.

Ray Dalbey of Drake set the second
new mark when he cleared the bar in
the pole vault at 12 ft 1-3 inch and
Dauber of Iowa heaved the shot as
feet 2 inches for a new talley in his
event. The other marks were made
in the mile relay team by the Pioneers
who were clocked in 3 minutes 23 57
10 seconds, and by- Taylor in the
high hurdles. This record of 15 sec-
onds flat will not he allowed however.
as the Pioneer ace knocked over two
hurdles on his way to the tape.

Taylor was easily the star of the
meet, taking three first places and
running on the winning relay team
and on the half mile team which pac-
and on the half mile team which plac—
23 6-10 seconds, 3710 of a second over
the World’s record held by Brookihs
of Iowa, and won the broad Jump with
a leap of 22 feet 0 1-2 inches. His
fast running in the mile relay was
largely responsible for the new mark
set and running anchor man on the
half mile relay, he ran a heart break-
ing race but was unable to over-come
the lead held by the Iowa university
team.

Floyd Green, Taylor's running mate,
in spite of a pulled tendon which crip-
pled him badly, ran second in the high
sticks and was pulling second in the
low timber-s until be cleared the last
one his leg gave way and he stumbled
into the tape to take fourth place. He
was unable to walk from the field.

Meyer spilled a little dope from the
bucket ivhen he ran third in the two
mile, He finished only a few yards
behind Mai-chi but was unable to pass
the Iowa man. Phelps, Olympic star
took the event in fast time.

Conger and Crawford of Ames
showed their ability as middle dls—
tancc men when they easily won the
mile and lralf mile respecitively.

lunefort, welglrt heavcr was un-
able to stay in the ring on his prelime
inary throws and although he hcavcrl
the leaden platter over 140 feet he
stepped slightly over the line on his
first three trials and consequently did
not get into the finals. He seemed
about to avenge himself in the shot
when he pushed it out 45 feet 10 inch-
es but Daubcr on his final heave set
the new record of 46 feet‘ and 2 inch-

The meet has been doped out by
several sport critics as Nebraska first
Kansas second and Grinnell third.
Nebraska seems to have the best all
around and well balanced team in the
conference and Kansas is likew e
nicely rounded with the exception of
weaknesses in the shot, di, lis and

One new mark is sure to be set. Cox

Rinefort have both been consistently

a new record. They also should have
the shot more or less their way.

Weir of Nebraska and Taylor of

l’l‘nlt‘gn of (l lgusﬁne Honored
Willi C.ptdlillcy of Basketball
Telull For Next Your.

At the Honor G banquet held last
Saturday night it was announced that
Harry wing ’26, would be basketball
captain for next year. Wing has
played a guard position on the cage
quintet for the last two years and is
also a football letter mart having gain-
ed a gridiron reputation of being one
of the hardest hitting men in the val-
ley.

Wing starred in high school ath-
letics at Greenfield before coming to
Grinnell. He was coached by “Mike"
Augustine, famous Grinnell athlete,
and during his high school competi-
tion was captain of the football, bas-
ketball and track teams. In addition
to these sports Wing is a good base-
ball player, gaining a posmou on one
of the allrdormitory teams in the re~
cent series.

With Wing as captain and Charles
Black as coach the basketball pros.
pects for next year are looking fairly
good. “Hap" Moran of Boone will
undoubtedly be the mainstay of the
team again this year and the scoring
machine will depend upon his accur—
ate eye. Chase, who won his letter at
forward will be back and there will be
other good material for the bertbes
that were vacated this year. Gar Lamb
will probably find a steady berth on
the five next year and some of this
year's fr-cshrncn may make depend-
able material. Those who showed lip
best were Smiley and Davis.

certainty that there will be little
sound sleep at the dormitories and the
