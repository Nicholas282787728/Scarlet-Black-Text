NEW PLAN FOR Y. M. MEETINGS

Two Short Talks Constitute Pro-
gram Thursday,

A new plan was inaugurated at the
Y, )1. c. A lllcellng Thursday evening
when ditioi-eut men were secured for
short addresses. This pic

he cai od out in tho tiltme to a cer-
tain extent, and it is liclic'vc‘d will get
more gehcral interest in the meetings
as well as presenting dillcrc’nt points
of view with dittercnt emphasis at the
same time. ‘

chos. hicClenry garo the rust talk.
He pointed out that the t two weelis
ot the Y. M. c, A. was built upon the
tact that Robins was coining, and now
tlle two wcohs alter, the memory and
the spirit of his meetings still live.
But it' the men are going to keep up the
spirit oi his meetings, it is up to them
to set the other students ot the eolA
logo interested in r. M work.

Dr_ lat-ans also told the felloll's that
the two main principles of lite are
thought and work. He emphasized the
importance or thought, but also showed
that there is a tendency in Grilineii to
neglect the action lor the listening.
Ho illustrated that ii the Raymond
Rolnnslncctillgs were going to accom-
plish good that the men ninst not only
think at them. but dlso act on their
pruiciplos. -
