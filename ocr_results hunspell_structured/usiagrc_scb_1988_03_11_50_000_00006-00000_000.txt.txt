The Blues Brothers

by Brian Strause

John Belushi is dead. and Dan
Aykroyd might as well be, con-
sidering his last iilm. “Dragnet."
Unfortuna|ely, the time has come
to bury these two comedians along
with their blockbuster hit, "The
Blues Brothers." Sure enough.
"The Blues Brothel 5 3| times a
veritable laugh riot. but when the
skits from "Saturday Night Live"
are transformed into one
marketable package. something
just doesn‘t click. The humor is
laced with car chases and blues
numbers, the idea being to shake
us up in the interim, A crash here
and some rollicking tunes there
should get you in the mood for the
deadpan humor or Belushi and
Aykroyd as Jake and Elwood.
Rock and rail. car crashes. and
comedy — they are as American as
nuclear warheads, the CIA, and
Ronald Reagan. Put them all
together and you’re in for a rip
roaring, kneerslapping. down-
home fiesta.

The chase scenes are epic in pro
portion. and make seeing this film
almost worthwhile just for the
enactment oi‘a common adoles»

(aka. Princess Leia). Man. the
odds are looking pretty slim, but
how can you lose when you're "on
a mission from God"?

and Ray Charles all rock the silver
screen with soul. The Blues
Brothers literally pale in com-
parison with their weak renditions
of some old classics. “Gimme
Some Lovin' ,. is especially
shallow. They just don't have the
soul to pull this masquerade on.
The problem is that Belushi and
Aykroyd are too good for parody,
hut fall short of the real thing. The
only soul Belushi has is from car
caine and speed. As Mindy Giles of
Alligator Records says, “it’s just
another white band trying to rip off
our music."

Withou a doubt, “The Blues
Brothers' is good entertainment,
but how many vieivings does it
take beiore you know it by heartl
This film has been tattooed on the
minds or a generation, and it’s
geting a little monotonous having
people justity being nutballs
because “We‘re on a mission from
God." How many times do i have
to hear. “Your women, 1 want to
buy your women?” These jokes
have been stamped into the
ground. So, if you haven’t seen this
film. enhance your sense of humor
with some preliminary mind ex
pansion and have a good ole time.
As for me, l'm jaded and would
rather shoot up some speedhalls in
a sleazy L.A. hotel.

The Year of Living

Dangerously

by Bruce Emond

Set in Jakarta in 1965 during the
tumultuous final days of the Sukar-
no regime. “The Year ot Living
Dangerously" details the romance
between an Australian journalist
tMel Gibson) and Gillian, a British
Embassy worker iSigourney
Weaver) Like director Peter
Weir's earlier effort, "Picnic at
Hanging Rock," this tilm excites
and enchants the viewer with
beautiful landscapes and a soulful
musical score.

“The Year of Living Dangerous-
ly," titled for Sukarno's prediction
for 1965. opens witii Gibson arrive
mg at Jakarta's crowded airport
assigned to cover Sukarno's in-
creasingly erratic and anti»
Western diatribes. The city is filled
with other Wes|ern journalists,
nonchalantiy reporting further
Sukarno excesses and outlandish
pronouncements from the safe con-
fines of the bar at the Jakarta
Hilton.

Gibson eschews joining this
group tone member is depicted as
a chronic customer of Jakarta's
prostitutes. another is shown, in
what is arguably the film’s only
gratuitous scene, to be a homosex»
ual who uses his loung male ser»
vaiit for sex). His adjustment to
the city is eased by Billy, the
enigmatic dwari whom he
befriends. Billy understands the in»
ner workings oi Jakarta‘s political
hierarchy and its manipulation of
the Soviet and Chinese govern»
ments (or economic aid, His savvy,
particularly regarding the immiv
nent arrival oi a shipment of arms
from the Mao government. pro
vides Gibson's character with
valuable scoops.

Parallel to the political tension is
the tangled ménage a trois of the
journalist. Billy, and the British
Embassy worker, The love airair
between Gibson and Weaver
destroys Billy, who realizes that
his physical ugliness precludes her
ever loving him, His death by jumr
ping from the balcony of the hotel
after unveiling a banner deman-
ding that Sukarno reed starving ln-
donesians is more an escape from
his own despondency than an act of
political martyrdom.

Billy’s death foreshadowed the
rapid turn or events. as the PKI
(Fartai Komunis Indonesia, or in
donesian Communist Partyl laun-
ched an abortive coup attempt, to
turing and murdering six promir
nent military officials. Although it
was rapidly crushed, the event had
great influence. Sukarno, who it
was believed supported the PM,
was forced to renounce his title of
president for lite, and an estimated
500,000 people were slaughtered,
often for the flimsiest ties to the
Communist party.

“The Year of the Living
Dangerously” is a rare lilm, en~
tirely involving and captivating
the Viewer. it skillfully captures
the beauty of indonesia. the charm
which makes one want to return to
this nation. There are many
memorable scenes: Gibson's ar~
rival at the Jakarta airport, the air
