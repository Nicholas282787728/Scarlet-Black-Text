SCARLET AND BLACK

The Human Element

The yellow school bus shud-
tcrod as it slowed at Mike Rick-

y, but the driver smacked him
It the rear as he passed and said,
'Behave next time!" Mike ig-
t ored him and stomped explo-
ively down the steps.

He shufﬂed around in front of

the bus, stirring up dust on tlte

Jim Duncan

gravelrpacked road. The little
boy barely stood above the height
of tltc front bumper. When he
had reached the other side of the
road safely the bus groancd as the
driver forced gears. When it was
too far away, Mike threw a rock
at the back window and felt no
satisfaction even when it clanked
against the rear emergency exit.
The trailer park stretched out
from the bottom of the short hill,
There, most homes were decrepit,
with rusting skirts and cmmbling
cinder block bases. Most sagged

in the center. There were sets of
droopy clothes lines strung across
each yardrnext to each trailer.
His was another of those trailers;
around the side at the back door
there were rolling wooden steps.
The key was hidden under the
ﬂimsy welcome maL

The dingy kitchen was stuffy,
and sour from being closed up all
day. A warm, half-touched beer
was tucked in under the shelves at
the back of the counter -- Dave‘s.
Mom's sometimes boyfriend.
Mike sipped at it and spit in the
sink. He pulled out a drawer and
stood on it, rooting around for
the Pop-tarts hidden in one of the
cupboards. They were stocked
mostly with canned goods.

He sauntered into the living
room munching on Ritz crackers
and ﬁnally sprawled out on the
threadbare couch to watch after
noon cartoons.

The sun had begun to slant
through the scarred picture win-
dow. Chilly. hazy light ﬁltered

through the stained curtains.
Mike was tired of watching car-
toons, so he bounced a tennis
ball around on the kitchen
linoleum for a while, then decided
to go outside. Maybe tonight
there'd be tuna casserole for din-
ner. Morn would get home at
6:30. He'd have just enough
time to thrash Billie Moore, who
lived two trailers down.

Mom still hadn't. come home
after dark. At 9:00, Mike opened
up a can of peaches. He watched
TV until he fell asleep.

The next day, Mike went to
school in the clothes he'd Slept
in. It wasn't the first time. Sur-
prisingly, he didn‘t lash into any
scrapes, and Mrs. Trout compli-
mented him on his art. The bus
driver even smiled and let him
off, saying, "Seeya tomorruh
Mike."

Mom didn't come home that
night ciLher. Or the next.
Or ever again.

Against the

"Reality Break"

Divest Now! Boycott Coke!
Ban California grapes from our
tables!

LeLs talk token gestures.

Somewhere in California,
Mexican nationals are picking
grapes for $1.75 an hour in a
toxic environment. Across the
Atlantic. a repressive govcmment
is smashing a popular uprising

Mike Kent

through the use of violence and
treachery. Concerned Americans
across the country scream out
"what can we do to end these
crimes against humanity?!" The
answer: boycott.

I don't support aparthied
(maybe in a future column), I
don't support the exploitation of
illegal aliens by greedy ranchers.
but i also don't support boycotts

~ as a means of fighting them.

Boycotts are token gestures.
They don't. fight problems ber
muse they never have a signifi-
cant effect on their target indus»
try. Also, more often than not.
they hurt the people they are
meant to help.

Lets look and some specific
examples, shall we? There is a
big movement on campus right
now to boycott Coke products.
the vile
South African regime, and there-
fore must be made to pay the so
cial consequences. Dozens of
Americans stop buying Coke
products. To respond to this drop
in sales and to redeem itself so
cially, Coke closes all of its
South African plants. Prior to the
boycott, thousands of blacks were
protesting their government.
Now that Americans, in their in-
finite wisdom, have completely
divcstcd in South Africa, we have
thousands of unemployed blacks
protesting their goverment. How
keen do you think the South
African government is going to
be on the idea of welfare?

Unfortunately in today's
world of politics. money equals
power. In taking the jobs away
from the blacks, we have actually
made them more at the mercy of
their government. We’re so
helpful.

Or try this scenario, faced
with declining sales, Coke is
forced to close plants. but decides
to close its American plants. be—
cause labor costs more here. So
hclptnl.

Lets look at the grape grOWr

ers. The vile ranchers employ
illegals to pick their grapes at a
low cost, forcing them to pick
them from fields that have been
sprayed with pesticides. so they
can sell them to American con-
sumers at a lower cost. Not ev-
cry grape grower does this, but
some do. Here's a news flash:
IN CALIFORNIA IT IS
AGAINST THE LAW TO EM-
PLOY ILLEGAL ALIENS. IT
IS ALSO AGAINST THE LAW
TO FORCE LABORERS TO
WORK IN HAZARDOUS
CONDITIONS. These laws are
enforced, just ask any border par
trol agent or California Ag Dept.
agent. What more exactly is de-
sired by ihose who would boycott
the grapes? Shall we make it
more illegal? The lines imposed
destroy several years profits for
the grape growers (lets hear it for
subsidies and ball outsl).

Economically speaking, a
grape boycott would hurt those
ranchers employing Americans
more than those employing ille-
gals. If demand for grapes were
to decline, there would be a sur-
plus, causing price to fall.
Eventually the market would
clear but after all was said and
done there would just be fewer
grape pickers, both American and
Mexican. The problem would
still exist, just on a smaller
scale.

Boyeotting Calilomia grapes
because some of the growers are
breaking the law is like closing
down a college because three stu-
dents were caught in possession
of a controlled substance. The
people hurt the most would be
those who were trying to be good
citizens and legally get an educa-
tion. The grape growers can't
police themselves. they have no
legal grounds, certainly not
enough money and resources, and
neither do they have the obliga-
tion. You don't see many other
professions being forced to take
on the kind of responsiblity it
seems the grape growers are be-
ing asked to assume.

As a closing remark, being a
native Californian, I can assure
you that our state government is
quite capable of handling our
state's problems. We don't need
Iowan philosophers making our
policies for us. Your concern is
appreciated, but I would apprecir
ate being given the privilege of
deciding for myself whether or
notl wtsh to dine on California
table grapes,
