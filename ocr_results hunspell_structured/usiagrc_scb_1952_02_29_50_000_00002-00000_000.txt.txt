To the editors:
We feel that in evaluating the

situations. We need a renewal
of enthusiasm, and that must
necessarily come from the top.
No one has listened to the con»
stant complaints of the student
body. Perhaps they will listen to
one in the major campus posir
tion.

I am for John. I know John’s
sincerity, and I respect his abil-
ities as a leader. And further-
more, I think it is the duty of
everyone in the student body to
make an effort to know John
and all of the candidates.

We are now beginning a week
of furious activity, and there
will he no possible reason for
someone to say “I don’t know
him.” Let us take full advantr
age of every aspect of the cam—
paigning, and choose the man
who will give us a strong stu—
dent go ernment in practice. In
my opi ion, that man is John

When they announced th.
names of the five candidates a
Supper last night, my firs
thought was that four of the
are destined to become flops
failures, and has—beens, startin
in September. 1 personally thin.
that they’re all pretty wel
qualified.

A smart candidate would ge
busy right away and star
practicing his “good-loser” gri
in front of a mirror.

I refuse to some out in iavo
of any one candidate, but I'll sa
this much: I won’t vote for
guy who’s had any experienc-
whatever on the Student Council.
As far as I’m concerned that’
the worst rccmmendation
candidate can offer. As it
written in the Koran, ”birds of
a feather flock together.”

Faét or Farce?

At 12:01 this morning the signs went up. From now
until Monday, March 10, the proverbial smoke-filled rooms,
intrigue, and excitement which goes with campaigning for
Student Council president will all be a part of the Grin-

nell scene. . .
Thus it is time for the conventional editorial, the one

ballyhooing the values and purposes of student government.
It is difficult for uS to write Such an editorial, however.
oftentimes during the past year, we have felt the
words “student government" were nothing but farcical.
We have seen little “student government," Rather we have
seen seemingly futile discussions by student leaders con-

Dear editors

A large variety of ,candidates.
with an even larger variety of
reasons, have already chosen to

nonsense and hypocrisy of cam-
pus politics. l’ll vote for the guy
who can answer the fewest
questions about Robert’s Rules

cerning administrative decisions already handed down.
Yet we have a regard for student government, In the
Nov. 2 edition of the 88:3 we wrote, ”There are those who
feel that student government is nothing but a puppet
organization, We, however, choose to call it—even in its
lesser sense~a buffer between students and administra-
tion. AS such, it receives many of the blows that might
otherwise be directed toward the student body. For this

run for the presidency of the
Student Council, Realizing both
the qualities and deficiencies 0!
these candidates, we wish to
present our candidate for the
presidency of the Student Coun~
cil, Jim Foster.

We have chosen to support
Jim for several reasons, most
of which deal with the person-
ality of the candidate. First of
all let us look at the things

our campus? Therefore he must
be a person in whom you will
have confidence and for whom
you will have respect.

I have confidence in and re—
spect for Harvey Nixon, He is
a good representative of Grinnell
college. He has Served as an of-
ficer of the junior class in the
position of social chairman. He
has had experience working with

o

of Order.

The fellow I vote for will have

to be more than a “nice guy,"
too. He'll have to have more to

ffer than a mimcographed

“platform” with which he clut-
tel‘s my mailbox and the book-—
store floor.

If] like to see a Student Coun-

cil president who represents just
the slightest departure from the

reason alone, it is worthwhile.”

We retain that opinion. Perhaps student government
is nothing but a phrase which sounds good in college pubs
licity material. Perhaps it is simply an ego»building med-
ium for certain ego-seeking students. Perhaps it fools tls
into believing we have some control over our situation at

that Jim isn’t. He's not an
athlete, a singer, a social coordi-
nat an actor, nor a campus
pol an.

He seeks office, not on what
he has done in the past, but on
what he proposes to do in the

people in his hall on the house
council as personnel chairman
and social chairman. AS a fresh—
man he was honored as a Her-
mit.

He represents ”new blood” for
the Student Council, with an

kind of “type" which men like
Sinclair Lewis have taught us
to associate with ”success." I’d
like to see a Grinneu Student
Council president who has never
owned a pair of white bucks, or
a cashmere sweater.

He is the man to present to the

I think the Student Council

president should havea thorough
background on both sides of the
academic fence. I mean that he
should be a guy who has dared
to step across the line of con-
formity, even if it was on some-
one‘s toes. And 1 don't mean the
kind ot‘ publicity fanatic and
soap-box Daniel Webster whose

dle agency which can provide it soft cushion between ad-
ministration and student. We would like it to be more than
a cushion, however. We feel there iS at definite require-
ment for a student government which can do away with
the feeling of futility which so often pervades the Grin-
nell campus. Such a student government must be more

gaudy display of posters and
a list of promises that all of
us realize are utterly impossible
to fulfill.

Jim’s idea is to be a middle»
man between the students and
administration: to face the funda-
mental facts concerning the

administration, when necessary,
a unified student opinion for
consideration land acceptance,
These qualities are assets to
the president of the Student
Council. Foremost, however, is a
sincere interest in the position
and a genuine desire for it. Har-

than a buffer, more than a cushion.
At the moment, the Student Council presidency has

Cll should and can hold in Cam»

plans and platforms are only ex-
ceeded in number by his psy-

taken on a significance it probably will not regain until His platform

next year at this time. But such need not be the case,
As the main coordinating unit between north and
south campus the importance of the Student Council as a
governing agent should be unquestionable. Whether the
Student Council is a governing agent depends greatly on
the administration but it also depends on its head, the
Student Council president. Consequently much of the Stic-

Mary Grimm chases

Finally, I think our Student
Council president should have a
few oallouses on his hands, and
not just a shine to the seat of
his pants. The last three pres~
idents have all been able to run
around the block, which is

practical ideas acceptable to both

To repeat, let us pledge our
support to Jim Foster. the can.

“Would the board of direc-

Obviously, the answer is no.
They would choose a man with

the candidates carefully.

Consider their records. Then support the one who will
attempt to give you real student government.

Fire in ‘N. Younker
Causes $50 Loss

A fire originating in the back
of an over—stuffed $15 daven—
port caused an estimated $50
damage to -a north Younker
second floor room at 8:30 pm,
Saturday.

The fire was discovered when
one roommate, Ray Staffeldt,
walked into the room and in-
formed Dave Peters. who was
sitting on the davenport, that
smoke was coming from the
back of the over—stuffed piece
of furniture.

The two men, with the help
of Dave Larson, put out the
blaze.

manager.

To the ed ors.

Will Grinnell ever have a'
Student Council that is truly re-
spected by both the students and
the administration? All Grinnell—
lans will admit that interest in
student government comes only
at election time, and every pre-
ceeding candidate has claimed
that he will maintain that inter
est, and failed.

I think our campus needs a
leader who is forceful enough
to tie together the north and
south campuses through the
Student Council. According to
the constitution, the Student
Council has the power to deter-
mine any activities Concerning
the entire student body, and yet
we remain two separate campuses.
What we need is a man who is
sincere and aggressive, for the
combination of these two dual-
ities will make possible the
we now lack in ourl
student government.

I believe John Mcclintock can
give us the wanted leadership,
for his personality is one that
incites action and he is a man

 

 

lnot only on campus,

experience, tavt, a knack for
handling people, and a sincere
belief in the organization.

Likewise in choosing a presi-
dent of the Student Council.
these vital factors must be con—
sidered. For this is the man
who will personify the school
but out-
side as well. We feel that Jack
Reddan has these qualificar
tions plus a sound, alive pi'o~,
gram that will bring about
concentrated student action and
rejuvenate student interest,

Jack’s interest in student gov-
ernment is no new awakening
It began his freshman year and
is based on two and one half
years of solid experience. He,
has shown his ability and
proved himself time and again
in various capacities such as
a member of the Student Coun.
cil, president of the Board of
Religion, a member of the
Board of Religion. a member
of the Board of Publications.
vice—president of Dibble hall,
and an active part in new sttr‘
dent days for the past two
years.

We feel that Jack will secure
for the students from the ad—
ministration something that
they haven't had up to this
time a a square deal based on
a fair hearing, i
