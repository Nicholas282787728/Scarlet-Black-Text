“Grungy” Post Office to be renovated

"It’s about the grungiest place on
campus," said Executive Vice-
President Waldo Walker, explaining
why the Post Office is being renovated
this summer. Walker Cited ”bad work-
ing conditions" among the reasons for
the alterations.

The renovation is being directed by
the combined efforts of Walker's ofﬁce
and Dale Hawn, director of the
Physical Plant. The actual changes will
include an expanded work room for the
13.0. employees. new boxes that will re-
quire a key to open and cork bulletin
boards around the walls for campus
group to post their notices. The front
(bookstore side) facade will be altered
as well. A wall will be built across it at
ground level. in front of the stairs that
lead down to the doors. The new door-
way will be installed at the far right
(north) corner of the building.

The doors have been moved to keep
all steps on the inside. It is hoped this
will prevent them from freezing in the
winter. A bank of mailboxes will be in-
stalled just inside these doors, still on
ground level. These boxes will be
assigned to handicapped students. It
will be possible tor them to get their
mail without having to go down any

stalls. There are also plans to install
outside dropboxes for outgoing mail so
that students who wish only to post let
ters may do so without entering the
Post Office.

One change that students may find
annoying is the lack of access to faculty
boxes, All of the boxa will remain lock-
ed and drop slots cannot be added.
Many students use the drop slots to
hand in late papers and assignments.
Rita Tindle. administrative supervisor
in charge of the Post Oilice. recognizes
this problem and reported that other
options are being considered. Tindle
suggested that students might have to
use campus mail to hand in their
assignments or a drop slot might be in
stalled in the door of the Faculty
Secretary’s otiice.

When asked about the switch from
combination locks to key locks, Walker
justified the change by stating, “Coma
bination boxes are difficult to maintain
and gel." He described the Current
boxes, many of which do not lock, as a
“. . . major security problem at the col-
lege.” Tindle added, “We do have mail
that comes up missing.”

The biggest complaint about the pre-
sent P.O. set up has been the lack of

space. “It’s been a circus in ere," said
Bernadette Siebert, Mail rvice c0r
manager. “We encourage renovation
{or space," she also commented. Her
husband Keri Siebert, the other Mail
Service co-manager, said the changes
were “. . . probably overdue" as he
gestured around at the small work
space and described how cramped it is
when there is a lot of parcel mail at the
beginning and end of each year.

Siebert also mentioned that the boxes
would be one row lower next year so
that shorter students wouldn’t have so
much trouble reaching boxes in the top
row. He added that they are looking into
the possibility or installing a stamp ven-
ding machine to clear up congestion at
the P.0. window.

Both of the Sieberts are excited about
the new renovations. Bernadette
Siegbert felt that they would have . .
better service becauseit [the new P 0.]
will be more efficient." Ken Siebert
said that he is . . very happy that a
renovation is taking place." He also
stated, “when people come back they
will have to be patient with the [new]
system. We'll still be working things out
and it will be hectic.”

Apple proves fruitful to college

by Laura McDermith

Seven Apple 11 personal computers
have been donated to Grinnell College
by Apple Computers, Inc. Grinnell has
agreed to purchase an additional tour
along with some accessories to increase
the capabilities of the computers.

Steven Jobs is the co—founder and
chairman at Apple Computers; he is
also a trustee [or Grinnell College. He
donated the seven Apple systems
because it “seemed like a good idea.”
Jobs Said that although Grinnell’s coma
puter facilities are superior to most
small liberal-arts colleges, the coma
puting power of colleges and univer-
sities in general is behind that of high
schools. Colleges generally invﬂsted
early in big, expensive timeshare
systems, but high schools waited and
are now investing in modern equip-
ment. By donating the Apples, Jobs is
not only improving Grinnell’s computer
facilities, he is introducing a new
medium for Grinnell College students
and faculty to explore.

Jobs secs beyond conventional uses

puters aren't big computers," he said.
Jobs compared small computers. to
televisions. When televisions were first
introduced. Jobs explained, the broad
casting of radio shows was shown;

similarly, small personal computers
are being used to do work usually done
by large computers.

The 11 Apples are going to the physics
and chemistry labs to), the psychology
labs (2), the preschool (l), the math
department (2), the math lab (3) and
one Apple will be devoted to general
graphics development.

The physics and chemistry depart»
ments hope to develop the Apples as a
general purpose laboratory tool for use

‘at all levels. Use oi the personal coma

puters will free time usually spent do-
ing tedious measurements and will
hopefully shit! the emphasis of the labs
from measuring m lmrning important
reactions and concepts.

The psychology department will use
the Apples to replace some awkward
and expensive experimental devices
that they now use to illustrate theories.
The personal computers can analyze
results during an experiment and again
free the student from tedious calcula~
tions. *

Small children at the Preschool will
use the Apples to develope the ability to
“perceive and understand fundamean
quantitative and spatial relationships,
the ability to recognize letter and
number symbols, the ability to solve

simple reasoning problems with con-
crete objects and the ability to detect
important auditory cues in speech and
nonrspeech stimuli,” according m the
proposal to introduce the Use of the Ap

Curriculum, writoen by _ the depart.

plain their intended use.

The math department will use the Ap-
ples primarily [or Calculus 11 classes
where they will be useful in illustrating
functions of two variables quickly and

faster than the timeshare system and
the Apples have the capacity {or color
graphics which will increase the clarity
of the figures. The math lab will also
use the Apples to demonstrate
mathematical concepts visually.

The new personal computers wil be
used by many students, not just by
those who know how to program. On the
Apple system, programs are stored on
programmed discs, similar to casset-
les. rather than internally like the PDF
“/70. The Computer Services Center
hopes to organize a library oi these pro-
grammed discs that students can check
out.
