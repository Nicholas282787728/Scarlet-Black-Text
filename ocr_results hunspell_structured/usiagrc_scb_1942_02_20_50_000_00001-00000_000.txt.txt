Student Council Elections Open Fire

Within two weeks the open-
ing gulls of the 1942 Stu-
dent Council presidential elecs
tion will be fired, and the
campaign will roar into ac—
, tion.
At present nine men can be

considered potential candidates,
according to a survey during the

past ten days.

The men are Gearge
Bishop, William McKeon,
Jack Frye, William Van
Duzer, Paul Bremicker,
John Miller, William Kzllou»
pelt, and Charles Gee.

Bishop.

In the survey Bishop seems to
take top honors because of his
popularity in both the dorms and
quad. Also he has had executive
training this year as president of
Smith hall.

However, the one drawback
might be that he will be extreme»
ly busy during the fall as cap-
tain of the 1942 Pioneer grid
team.

McKeon.

Pushing Bishop for top honors
is William McKeon, resident of
Gates hall. McKeon, present mem—

Plan Vicl'ory Dance Sa’rurday

A Gadabout extra, in the form of
a Victory dance, will be featured
Saturday evening following the

basketball games, according to
James Miles, director. The dance,
an informal stag, will be to the
music of recordings in the quad
rangle rec room, he said.

A few chances of dates on the
back of Gadabout tickets have

also been made, Miles announced.
The hayride party, originally plan-
ned for May 1, has been changed
to May 3 because of a formal
dinner to be given at the quad-
rangle that evening.

The theater party, scheduled for
April 2, is still indefinite, because
that date is the night before Good
Friday.

68 % of Student Workers Receive Top Rating on work

Supervisors ‘Would Hire
Majority of Students
For Owu Work Needs

35% of the employed women and
33% of the men received top rat-
ings on their student work, accord-
ing to Maurice D. Woolf, director
of vocational guidance.

In answer to the question
“Would you be willing to hire this
student yourself if you had such
a need?" the supervisors said yes
for 895% of the men, and for
86.7% of the coeds. On the other
hand the supervisors sald no for

5,77% of the men, and for 6% of
the women. Answers for the re—
mainder of the group were stated
with qualifications, Woolf said.

The median rating in both
groups was toward the top of the
scale. There is probably some
prejudice in the ratings, but super
visors made favorable comments
about the student's labor again
and again, and in addition wrote
voluntary comments about the
workers on the rating scale. Wo-
men received 46 voluntary favor—
able comments, while the men re
ceived 44, he said.

Noisiness and hurrying received

the greatest frequency for men
while social agrcssiveness. or the
lack of it, and carelessness in
small details, lack of initiative,
and not thinking through a task
appeared most often in sugges-
tions made about the women, he
said.

Praise receiving the highest fre-
quency for men dealt with relia
bility and willingness to do extra
work, For the women careful-
ness, thoroughness in work and
ability to work with others re
ceived the highest frequency, he

strong backing in both the dorms
and the quad, and with his ex-
perience this year as junior rep—

prove to be_a strong candidate
that deserves attention.

Frye.

Jack Frye, resident of Smith
hall, former Student Council
member, and past house council»
man at Carney house, has plenty
of executive ability to carry out
the duties of Student Council
president. However, he is not as
