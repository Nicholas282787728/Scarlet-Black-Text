At the request of the Srm/L'f
is Show I agreed to write an
analysis ofthe announced 12.6
percent tuition hike which,
according to a headline in the
Der Mai/Ml Regirtul' (Jan.23),
has “stunned” the Grinnell
strident body. Brit ﬁrst I’d to
talk about airplanes. Consider
this: it takes a whole lot of
money to build a Boeing 747,
just like it takes a whole lot
of money to round a collcgcr
Once it’s built, liowevci', ﬁlle
ing an cmpry seat with one
more passenger is cheap, as
is ﬁlling an empty seat in a
classroom. Also, you can't sell
you’re airline ticket to someone
else any more than you can
sell them your acceptance to
Grinnell. One result of these
similarities is that both airlines
and colleges charge diliercnt
people different amounts of
money for exactly the same
service. The grandmother in
the window seat may pay half
as much as the accountant on
the aisle. just as, in my seminar,
Bobbi Jo, who pays 329,000
per year, sits next to Betty Sue
who pays nothing. (I chose
names that couldn't possir
bly belong to actual Grinncll
Studcnt5,) Airlines call this
“discounting fates", Colleges
callit“ﬁnancial aid”. (Which

Pricing Prestige

Grinnell‘s Economics chair explains—via extended metaphor and a hand-
ful of sarcasm—the arguments tor and against the tuition increase

should be a lesson to Airlines
iwouldn’t it sound better to
say, “We at United oﬂcr sub-
staritial ﬁnancial aid to anyone
who has to stay over a Saturday
night ?) Anyway, economists
refer to both practices as price
discrimination" and know that
it’s an efﬁcient way to extract
maximum revenue from a given
group of”customcrs". Those
who are willing and able to pay
more, pay more,

I am not trying to be cyni-
cal here; I know that airlines
and colleges have very diaerent
objectives in doing business, so
to speak. The latter aren't tryr
ing to squeeze the most money
out of their students; colleges
are almost always non'pl’ofil
institutions. (Actually, a lot of
airlines are too, though usually
not by choice.) The point is that
the similarity in price structure
is no coincidence, nor is the
key result: costs are distributed
unevenly among the pool or
customers. Business tmvelers
subsidize vacationers; rich col-
lege kids subsi lzc poor ones.
is this fair? Is this socially just?
Should someone have to pay
more for the same service just
because she has higher income?
1 refer such questions to the
Philosophy Department. I just
know that it s a highly cﬂicient
method ofpricing.

so am 1 saying that Grinr
hell's big tuition hike is per
tectly valid because it merely
redistributes costs from the
wealthy to the less-wealthy
students? Well, no, not quite.
(Disclosur it's easy for me to
accept tuition hikes, my daughr
ter pays zero tuition because my
wife and I are faculty.) Mainly,
I’m worried about the eti’cet of
this tuition hike on our ability
to recruit good students. Refer
back the Dar Maine: Regatta
piece. Its tonc suggestsiztndl
hope this is not the view of the
administriltionithat raising
tuition is a win-win situation.

Higher tuition will give us

more revenue and more ap-
plicants, It will make us more
attractive in the eyes of par
spective students. The Regirrrr
quotes admission consultant
Steve Goodman as saying that
“There’s a sizable segment of
the American population that
equate price with quality," and
that by raising tuition,Gr‘rnnell
is simultaneously raising its
prestige. Really? Hmmmm.
Ifthis is true, maybe we should
set tuition and fees at $43,660 a
year; that‘s $5 more than Hare
vard and we would be number
one for a change! OK, that’s a
stupid point, but it illustrates
the difﬁculty I have with this
concept. (Cunt. on )7. 13)

Rising tuition: student stories

Last semester, SGA President Chris Hall '07 compiled a book of students’
thoughts about Grinnell tuition, from the acerbic to the accomodating,

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grinnell in graphic comparison: pr'Grinncll's tuition
was increasing raster than its pcers'tor several years; then after 2001,
increased at a relatively lower rate than its peers. Grrnnell’s turtion

still starts and ﬁnishes at a lower dollar amount than its peeis, though,

In 2007, Grinncll chaigcs $29,030 versus an average of $33,103
charged by its peers. Bollolll.‘ Grinnell's tuition rises taster than HEPI,

which measures inﬂation orcosts orgoods and services used by colleges.

and mailed a copy to every Trustee. What do students have to say?

“I think tlrc policy's having a rerrihlc cheer
on this school that'sjust too subtle to notice “11’
mediatelyand the more gross the price iiicieases,
the more gross the impact on the student body.
One of the most valuable things about this
school. for me, is that all my friends are smart
and geeky and nerdy. and they have dilierent
experiences than I do. I can learn fioin them
as well as from the professors. Don‘t change
that for the sake otrnore rnoneyin your cotrers,
Grinnell."

“Grinncll should be differentwit should
be a place where you don’t have to be in debt
tor years atrer school, or work your ass err for
work study so that you're too tired to concen-
trate on the classes you came here to take, Yes,
sometimes we're going to have to work for our
education, and it won’t be a walk in the park,
but Grinnell should actively try to make it as
easy as possible."

"I feel bcrraycd by the school I chose to at-
tend based on its unpretentious attitude, because
given the chance, it chose to increase costs in an
attempt to enhance its elitist appeal."

-Zoe Lmr '10

“These tuition increases make it harder and
harder and less and less viable for students from
working and even middle class families to be
able to attend Grinnell, Grinnell will pay for
these tuition increases in loss ofsoc‘roeconornic
diversity in the student body and in loss ofctedr
ibility as a purportedly progressive and liberal
institution."

eMary Ncrbit ’07

"Although I believe Grinnell is generous
with their ﬁnancial aid to students, thc fan-is
ily contribution will drastically increase with
such a hike in tutition, which should not be
happening. Grinnell is unique because otits
accessibiliry with regards to cost and the high
level of education one receives here. This tu-
itiori increase sccrns to go against everything
Grinnell promises to its students past, present,
and future."

‘Bu‘ky Mware ‘07

“If Grinnell’s tuition had been $43,000 I
promise you 1 would not have applied in the
ﬁrst place 1 would have recycled rts application
with Swarrhmorc and Bards I do not think
we need to raise tutition to create a new image
for the school or to pull more elite applicants.
In fact,l would be ashamed and disappointed
in the college if it follows through on this
huge tuition hike tor-what i see as the wrong

About the book: '

“The Trustccs are very receptive to our
thoughts irthey're presented well,"said SGA
President Chris Hall'07. Hall sent a campus
wide cmail Fall semester asking students to
send in their “thoughts and feelings about
tuition."

Using SGA funding, he published every
submitted story in a parnphlcrrlikc book and
mailed a copy to each Trustee. Hall received
only a “handful" of emails in response, all of
which he said were polite, supportrve and
noncomittal. But, Hall says,“It was construc»
tivc for students to think about it and really
feel like their thoughts were heard"
