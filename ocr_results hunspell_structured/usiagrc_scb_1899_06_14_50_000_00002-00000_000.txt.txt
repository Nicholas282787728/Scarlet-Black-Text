make much tliiierente anyhow what one
believedilhal is not breadth but “take
ness. Such a spirit shows lack oi illlelr
lectual virility. No Sellslespecllllg man
is pleased to hear himseli cliurneterwed
as “broad" in this sense, and he certainly
would neter so ntime himseli.

What is thetliiiereuce between a broad
minded man and a narrow miutlt-tl nituii
Perhaps this tvlll do; the narrow man is
not the man i th low oi many articles in
his creed, bttt lie is the man who, what-
ever his creed, demands that everyone
else hold the same creed. Now that is
your narrow ntan, whetheryou ﬁnd liim
in religion, in business, in politics or atiy
department oi otir community hie.

The same meaning inheres in the ternt
"provincinl" used to describe a certain
kind oi mind. \Vhen we say that one
has sucha narrow, provincial way oi
looking at things, we mean by that, that
his life is houttded by so narrow a prove
ince or community that he cannot see the
good that lies beyond his little Circllllle
scribed place and ctistoni. Now the cure
oi this provincial mind does not neces
sai-tly lie iii bodily travel to distant lands
~lhough that always enposes one to the
chance oi becoming a little more sensible
in his views ii he is generous enough to
accept the chance, but the cure riiust
mean that one shall enlarge his thoughts
beyond any narrow circle. it means
that he enlarge his sympathths to go out
beyond the class oi people into which he
is born, with whom be mostly associates.
To get rid oi the provincial mind one
must learn to sympathize with people
who live diiierently, act rlif‘lcrenlly. ieel
and think diiierently irom ltimseli, Now
this is one oi the hardest things in the
worldto do, The tendency oi human
nature is to shrink its sympathies close
within the range oi its personal touch.
The day laborer has great diiﬁculty in
looking at liie irom the pointoi view oi
his employer,

The strain and stress and turmoil oi
our modern liie is largely because oi
narrowness in the way oi lookingat hie,
most oi it is blamewortliy to sortie de~
gree, but we shall do well to he careiul
in ouryudgnient oi what the degree oi
hlameworthiness may he. For itt the
complications oi modern society we are
all oi us victims more than we are con-
scious wrong doers. Few men indeed
there are but would be glad to see things
better. lionly they knctv how to get a
hold oi things to make them better,
The world is inﬁnitelvmore in need oi
inspiration and inspiring leadership
which may ﬁnd enthusiastic iollowing,
rather than oi mere denticiation; denunr
ciation oi Pltdrisaism is always in order,
or oi Pharisees; but it must be tempered
by the kindly sp itoilovcto one’slcllow
men and lightened by the glow oi hope
which the eye oi initli may always see
beyond the darkest cloud

As our lives mature rightly, the more
we come to appreciate truly broad mind~
ed people, men whose sympathies are
as broad as their knowledge, whose
hearts are too big to behold any suiicr-
ing unmoved, or to look listlessly ttpon
any pain or wrong which they cnii get at
to help. So it comes about that truly
broad minded people are lllc most wiser
ly liclpiul ones, They help to make liie
sweet and generous. That beatitiiul
word oi l-laul's applies to them, the whole
thirteenth chapter oi First Corinthians,
They do not think tiiikiiidly oi othcr
people, they are not puiied up with
pride, they are not easily insulted, ior
they realize that every insult done to
them httrts the one who gives it more
than themselves who rcceite it. Tltcse
are the souls marked hy the dignity oi
patience. They are somewhat rostiul;
even though they become wildly ClllhllSs

 

iastic they will not become ianaticat,
Theytue the men dud uomtn oi truth
it ho know thatno iiititici hon bad things
in. lbe in the snlnll circle about them
or iii the wide norld, they surety tvitt he
bcllcr by and by.

A broad minded man is willing that
his neighbor should think diiiereutly
ii-om hiniseli and enjoy his thoughts.
He lecognlzcs his neighbors right to
such and synipathiies with him iii his In-
dependence. He willing to let his
neighbor he a good man in the neighbors
own way, and not accoiding to his own
cgotisticatstnndard. He s :lmnn lvlm
respects his neighbors views and iudg-
nlcnls,7llol indeed yielding his own,
btitgiving the same respect to diitcrout
opinions which he demands ior his own
opinions ttiiiering irorn those oiuthers.
"Put yourscli in his place" is the lay tevt
at it.

Under the portrait oi one oi the old
i<uritirsts oi Fiankiurt in Germany in

each other by yielding to each other in

weakness, hut iather by iai interchange
oi thought and ieeling, each respecting
the other as he respects himseli.

The provincial mind is precisely the
one who cannot do that, The narrow
man is disagreeable and irictional be-
cause oi the little hole out oi which hei —
sists on viewing the world, The little
hole is his own snul.‘

it is easy to apply this in any special
realm. The realm oi, religious thought
comes easily ﬁrst on this occasion. who
oi us considers him the truest christian
who conﬁnes his sympathies within his
own little denomination? However true
or however large that denomination may
be, it becomes small under such a per-
son's interpretation oi it. it would be
hard to rind the christian who does not
theotctically admit the correctness oi
this position, whatever his liio may he
actually. You will hardly ﬁndaCongrEr
gationahst so narrow but he will admit
that he must be christian ﬁrst, Congregar
tionalist second. And what Methodist is
there among us whose loyalty is not, in
theory at least, ﬁrst to Christ and second
to his otvn denomination, So 0[ all the
rcsl oi us, it is easier to he narrotv than
it is to he truly and iairly hroad, it is
easier to be exclusive in our sympathies,
and keep ourselves within the intense,
narrow range oi our own church and our
own way oi worship, than it is to be iairly
inclusive oi other religious views and
iorms oi worship and methods oi work.
Let us recognize irankly that there is as
rightiul a variety in reli ions taste as in
any other taste. Lct ench worship ac-
cording to his own iorms, those he likes

The educated mind has ncvcra right
to be the narrow mind, hutulast narrow-
ness is not conﬁned to the uneducated,
ior one my be narrowly educated, too,
and insist on narrowly educating liimseli
in spite oi whatever broadening influr

step iurther in tlus same held, and ask
what right have we l’rotcsinnts to despise
the Catholics? Precisely the same right
that the Catholics have to despise the
Protestants, only we do not like it St) well;
htit it is exactly as rational. One may
irankly deicnd the claim oi superiority

more crying need ior breadth oi vision.

Quite likely most oi tis here are prelu-
dtced in favoral the View that the Mir
row democrat IS narrower than the nar-
row republican and more coiiteniptible,
and we are both sure that the populist or
the proliihittontst is the narrowest oi all,

"boss," ol which there is only one sari,
namely, the contemptihle.

In lhe world of what cnlls itsell “so-
ciety" this narrow spirit is, it possible,
yet worse. My set, my Clique, my class.
That spirit it is which rests as a great
incubus on all the peoples oi the earth
today. In lndia it has wrought itsclf ins
to a system so that ii the shadow oi one
of lower caste fall on him of higllct
class, special expiation must be had be
fore he is ﬁt again in associate \villl his
own class. We look upon such things

wise sensible people can cherish such a
degradingsuperstition. How can a mar

lllliun in that shadow? But I imagine if
iln intelligent Hindoo should move aboul

our civi ration, he might find nearly as
much to amuse and Astonish him in our
superstitions, as we ﬁnd in his.

Our college life is not iree irorn this
same charge oi narrowness. The old
contrast between "town and gown"
each restitigiu its own pride, and Cour
tempt oi the other is in point. it is
very easy ior tlte student to think ltimr
seli a little better than other young men
in ills comlnllnily in which they both
live together. it is equally etisy ior the
seli respecting young men anti women
who are earning their living in the com-
munity in business or otherwise, to look
upon the college student as hardly
worthy oi their respect. So iar as any
such spirll exists in eillicr one it is whole
ly wrong. We all know it, hiit is any
one of us [rec [mm ii?

may have his pidgrnent go wrong be

There is one best solvent ior iiiiow.

would be greedy oi the richest gains that
we can gather, then ivc nitist he lavish

The motive, the spiiit, mtist be that or

the commandment oi thtl, which is ex

souls have called otit to its through all
the ages as the message oi the divine,

But it is time that we gather tip ottr

that the commandment oi God is not a
special edict, no more is ita collection oi
