C A BOOST FOR WILLIIIE

(Editor‘s note: Wendell Winkle is schodiued to
speak in the Shrine auditorium, Des Monies, on
Friday evening, May 11.)

After more than a year of rapidly increasing
third term boomlets, the maneuverings of a
handsome distiict attorney, and the ma-
chinations of such presidential hopefuls as
Garner and Farley on the Democratic side
of the fence and Gannett and Taft on the
Republican, the fast rising enthusiasm for
Wendell Willkie strikes us as something
fresh and different. l

Two months ago hardly mentioned as a
presidential candidate, Willkie by sheer
force of personality and common sense has
elevated himself into the position of whitest
of “dark horse” candidates.

Were Willlcie a politician, newspaper pub.
lisher, or other variety of “public servant,”
we should be inclined to look upon him as
just another candidate. But Willkie is presi»
dent of the Commonwealth and Southern
Utility 00., draws a salary of $75,000 per
year, and. is, therefore, a big business ty-
coon. And the way to the White House
from the most humble of log cabins is a
primrose path compared to that from the
sanctums of a much—maligned public uti ty.

G

But it is Willkie’s record in which we
are most interested. A graduate of In-
diana university where some termed him a
Socialist because he attempted to form a
class for the study of that creed, Willkie
during his college days was noted as a non-
comformist because of his loosernecked red
sweater, tobacco chewing, attacks on fra-

ternities, and preaching of revolt against
the faculty. l
After a career as a small-town lawyer, ’
in 1933 he was chosen to head the Com-
monwealth and Southern, the nation’s 21st
largest corporation. In this position Willlde
has advocated regulation of holding com<
panies, kicked the bankers off the board of
directors, and turned a $1,600,000 loss in
1934 into a profit of $10,600,000 in 1937,

Commenting on Mr. Willkie‘s rapidly
rising political star, Time magazine, report-
ing a recent meeting of the American News-
paper Publishers association, declared,
“After being subjected to Mr. Willkie’s
forceful forthrightness many a publisher
went home from the meeting convinced that
Willkie could be a winner. Notable converts
include John and Gardner Cowles, publishers
of the Des Moines Register and Tribune."

——G—

At this meeting Willkie had asserted,
“The conscientious liberal would find him-
self in agreement with most of the objects
of the New Deal’s legislation, although he
might want to change many of its provi-
siolls and change many of its methods.

”But the liberal does not see in the pres-
ent administration any will to leave men
free. For the old American principle that
government is a liabilty to be borne by the
citizens for the sake of peace, order, and
security, the New Deal has substituted the
notion that the government is an asset with-
out which none of us can survive. Its
growth becomes desirable in itself instead
of desirable only if it promotes the happiness
and independence of the people,”

For the statements above, and because
he is technically a “big business man,"
Willkie is going to‘be a sweet target for his
political opponents, but from what we’ve
heard of him he’ll be swinging with some
corking right hooks of his own.

0 AN OPEN LETTER

To the Grinnell Post of the American Le-
glon:

It has been reported to us that a quota
tion regarding some mythical “trouble of
the college with the local American Legion”
in the “Lady Godiva” feature in the May 4
issue has aroused a certain amount of re-
sentment among the local Legionnaires. .

The Scarlet and Black regrets that the
printing of this quotation as a part of a
farcical “plug" for the Brown Derby has
led to a threatened disruption ill the nor»
mally peaceful relations between the local
post of the Legion and this newspaper.

Like the entire story, the quotation was
of a humorous rather than a serious nature,
and we regret that any other interpretae
tion attached itself to i. Hence we are
thankful that the local clergymen, also men-
tioned in the quotation but as yet HOUrpl‘Or
testing, have evidently seen fit to View it
in that light.

We trust that this explanation will serve
to remove any possible ill-feelings, gentle-
men, and that our mutual regard will re-
main undilninishcd,
