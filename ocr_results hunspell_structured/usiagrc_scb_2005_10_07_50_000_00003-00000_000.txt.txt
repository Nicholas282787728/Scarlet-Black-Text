Communityservice unfunded

SGA wants the Community Sen/ice Center to fund student service
groups and charity groups, but the CSC lacks money and a director

Thcy give up their um and trivel up to in hour
each way, often on a weekly basis, to help the less for-
tunate. Some work at a Catholic sociiiljusricc group,
others play with loIVrincomc children and still more
encourage “restorative justice" at the Newton Correcr
tional Facility. One other thing all three gioups have
in common is that their funding hasjust been cur.

At last Tuesday’s Joint Board'
meeting, campus community sets
vice groups faced the consequence
of a guideline implemented by
SGA at the end of the spring
semester. According to Senator
Linn Davis '08 (East), the guides
line says that SGA will cut down
on funding to community service groups “ro pressure
rhe administration to give more money to the Come
munity Service Center. ”

The Student Programming Committee has ap—
proved the regular budgets of community service
groups. Requests to fund additional projects, however,
have been denied.

While most involved agree that the Community
Service Center (CSC) should receive more funding,
the denial offunds caused many complications. The
director ofthe csc, Amy Graves, is on leave, creating
a vacancy. Part of Graves’job is to be a liaison between
student service groups and the administration,

Committee denied the budget. According to leader
Vnshti Davis’OG, Joint Board could not give rhc group
any money, but iiicy did approvc the budgcr at so,

“It was a symbolic statement,"she said. “They said,
‘we support what you do’.”

AHH eventually got money for their project from
Student Affairs.

While Joint Board often debates funding issues,
administrative deCIsions are made
by a single person. “It cnii be much
more difﬁcult to gar money from
other places,” Vashti Davis said.

At the Joint Board meeting, a
Poverty Action Now representa-
tive, Rebeccn Blanchard ’06, said
that wirhour SGA ﬁlnding, her
group could get by for this semester bur would have
no money remaining for the spring.

Linn Davis said that if the SGA stood by this res-
olution, rhc Student Programming committee should
offer solutions to these campus groups, and push for
new sources of funding. “Joint Board really needs to
work on getting more advocacy for this resolution.”

Vashri Davis has formed an ad hoc committee to
"decide where community service groups should get
their money from next year.” Students interested in
the committee should contact Dims.

All three groups are now working to resolve fundr
ing issues and ensure that the money is available to
help growth. The ad hoc committee is researching
new sources offunding, possibly including the Prcsi-
dent's discretionary fund, which currently holds about
370,000.

Trustees finish meeting

No major changes have been made, but ideas raised for stra-
tegic plan, future of Cowies, Coke and gender-neutral housing

BY BRIAN PERBIX

The Grinncll trustees have come and gone from
their first board meeting of the year, leaving specular
tion about the future direction of the college in their
wake.

The trustees addressed this year's issues with vary
ing degrees ofcnution and concurrence.

President Russell K. Osgood presented a draft
version oftlic strategic Plan Implementation Docua
merit to the Executive Committee. This document
outlines concrete actions that the college hopes to
rake in order to accomplish the six strategies outlined
in its strategic plan.

Of great concern to students
has been the plan's call for tuition
hikes that would bring the comprer
hensive cost in line with Midwestr
em peer schools so as to “reﬂect the
quality and cost of [the school’s]
program," and to offset future cuts
in endowment spending.

At present, the plan suggests
adopting “for new students only nr
rhe beginning ofthe academic year beginning in 2007
a tuition estimated to be 100% of our middlerwcstern
peers."According to the Implementation Document,
this would either be a one-time hike, or a stepwise in—
crease phascd in over four years and applicable only to
incoming students. Studcnrs already enrolled would
likely face tuition hikes comparable to those of past
years.

“There was not a lot ofcomment [or] opposition,
because were engaged in a discussion process that will
go on for two or three months about this document,”
said President Osgood.

Part of rhnr discussion process began Thursday
night with trustee Clint Korver's ’89 presentirion to
student’s on the board’s endowment spending phllOS’
opliy. Fellow rrustce Todd Linden that the presenta-
tion was a good step towards “dciiiyslifying the role of
the board and the relationship it has to the college."

The President will present the Implementation
Document to Joint Board next week, and to stafi and
alumni groups throughout rlic rnll semester. A second
draft will be made in early November, and a final draft
will bc issued in late Januaiy to guide the budget for

that Wl// go on.”

”There was not a lot aftommenl
[or] opposm'on because we were
engaged in a dijmlS/bn protest

next year.

SGA Vice President Chiis Ochoa ’06 hopes the
ﬁnal document will address budgetary shortfalls in a
variety ofways. He said, "it became abundantly clear
after the trustee meeting that alumni giving was
something that they view as a problem as it is roo low
in comparison to our peers, and yet it is not some
thing that they seem to be addressing [in the impler
mentation document]."

Osgood and Marci Sorter vice prcsident or In-
stitutional and Budget Planning also presented the
current plan for the renovation ofCowles dining hall
into apartment -style housing to
the Buildings and Grounds coni-
mirree. However, the estimated
cost of 54.5 million was higher
than anticipated, and a new esti-
mate is being sought from a dirtcr-
ent company.

In conjunction with SGA and
Latin American Solidarity Gioup,
the college treasurer, David Clay,
presented a letter requesting rhar
the Board divest from Coca-Cola to the Investment
Committee.

According to SGA President John Bohmim ’06,
the Board has agreed to discuss whether or not to
hold Coca-Cola responsible for the actions ofa bots
cling company with which it does business, and fur—
thermorc, how much directitin it is comfortable giv-
ing its fund managers.

Essentially, Ochoa said, “The trustees can'tjust say
‘Pull Colte,’ because the endowment is invested with
niurunl fund managers rhnr invest according ro tlieii
own strategies."

“They can say, ‘In geneinl we don't want you ro
invest in this compaiiy”“ said Bohman.

Genderrueutral housing has been a priority to.
Student Affairs for sortie tiliic, and work on this 's-
suc his been ongoing since list ycirann Cnidy, Vice
president for Student Services, made .i presentation
re the board regarding gondei-ncurnil ho ,ing, and
the rcsponsc ivrs largely anioniblc. “We irirormcd rliu
trustees that we are looking into deﬁnitions and Piilll
ro discuss it with the president wrtliin the next row
weeks," Crildy said.

Clery Act Report

Report shows recent increases
in alcohol and drug violations

BY SARAH MIRK & LOLA GARCIA

Last week, the security oﬁice released the an-
nual crime statistics for college-owned property
or property immediately adjacent. The federally
mandated report showed ii recent spike in drug
and alcohol offenses.

The report shows the frequency of serious
crimes on campus and to whom they'were reports
ed in comparison to the two previous years.

In addition to providing the ﬁgures on crimes
committed, the report must also detail which, if
any, crimes indicate evidence of prejudice based
on religion, sexual orientation, disability or 2th
nicity. No such hate crimes have been reported on
the Grinnell campus.

Though the college complies with the 1990
law's requirement to keep statistics on major
crimes, Vice—President for Student Services Tom
Crady said that the Grinnell Security Depart-
ment's weekly online reports go beyond the Clery
Act’s requisite reporting. “Our feeling is students
have i right to know everything."

He also said that the college will put more
into the reports because of the nature of the Clery
Act itself, “The [statute] is not super-deﬁned," he
said.

On the Iowa campus, the most noticeable
change in crime rcporring between the year 2004
and previous years is the marked increase in drug
law Violations. This category of crime encompass
es any violation of state or local law relating to the
unlawful possession, sale, use, growing or making
of narcotic drugs,

In an email to the S (‘5 8, Director of Cam-
pus Security Stephen Briscoe explainedrthe rise as
part ofa cycle. “Drug law violations will vary from
year to year," he said. “some years you may have a
few and other year a lot."

In the year 2002, there were nine drug law vice
lotions on campus. During that year, there were
no arrests made. In the year 2003, only one drug
law violation was reported to Security, none were
reported to non—security personnel and no arrests
were made.

over the course or 2004, 20 drug law viola-
tions were reported. Campus security investigated
seven violations and non»securiry personnel ins
vestignted 13. Five people were arrested.

The rzport also showed a signiﬁcant increase
in reported liquor law violations—sis violations in
2004, up from zero in 2003 and three in 2002. No
students were arrested during any of these years
for liquor law violations. Six arsuris and 19 bur—
glaries were also reported in 2004.

Despite specific increases in some violations,
crady said rhnt there were no specific concerns in
response to the report. “Anything that is a serious
crimc we have a lot of concern about,” he said.
“We always worry about that."

The crime rate recorded by the Clery Act may
not be entirely accurate for a variety of reasons.
“I think there are things that are probably under-
reportcd," Crndy said. He specifically mentioned
sexual assault and acquaintance rape as crimes
likely to he under-reported on campus.

Though all employees are required to report
crimes considered dangerous to the campus com-
munity, rhc Chaplain and the Health Center are
conﬁdcntial.

Crady hopes that the report will raise student
awarcncss, “We WM)! students to lock their doors
iit night," said Crady. “That continues to be a
challenge."
