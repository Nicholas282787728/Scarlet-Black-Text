The position oiSGA President consists oi

three major parts: Keeping up with ad
ministrative details. working witii
numerous committees tas well as the
cabinet and Joint Boardl. and working
with even more numerous individuals.
Hence. the SGA President must be
organized and able to get things done He
must also be able to work well in groups
and relate Vtell to individuals.

willing to take responsibility and give my
time to other students My experience as
an SA has put me in touch with student
concerns [ can pproach a w'de variety at
students and solicit their opi ons This is
essential in representing the student body.

in general. I am a "team player," Runn-
ing SGA is a team eiiort. not a onerperson

possible when undertaking a task or
discussion an issue. i ieel i can accurately
and persuasively represent student opi-

The position oi student government
prestdenl is one (it importance to the stu
dent body._ Why? The president is a
representative. Hc/she must represent the
student body to the administration and
iaculty The president must be active in
this representation since it directly eiiecls
student life But. in order to learn what the
student body wants. the president must be
accessible. oiiice hours should not end at
the oiiice. since the president is always in
terested in what the people have to say. it
something seems to be a general desire oi
the student body, the president will try
his/her hardest to sec what can be done to
reach this goal, ln order to be eiiective. the
president must be an individual. not part
at any small seliinterest group Things get
accomplishedthis ivay

This is what I think the Student Govern»
mcrlt President should be. An active
representative intent on bettering student

At the present time, there is‘ a

moratorium on opening shelters for the
homeless in Des Moines. because the
legality oi their existence in zoned areas at
the city is being questioned This
moratorium is in place at a time or crisis.

cost of sass a nighti. Ruins Jones House
and SOJourner Truth Women's House. both
run by the Kindred Community. are the one
ly two tree shelters in Des Moines. The city
has threatened Rufus Jones House with the
eviction of 35 at the 45 men who live in the
house because the house is not up to the
standards set by city Codés The city re
quires that the Rufus Jones House have a
tire escape. but the city also reluses to
grant a permit to build one unless the
population oi the house be brought down to

35 men. By denying the right to build the
escape. the city is threatening the very
lives they are supposed to be protecting by
their ordinances. While the city threatens
the shelter. they are ignoring the iact that
many apartment buildings owned by slum
lords are also under code.
