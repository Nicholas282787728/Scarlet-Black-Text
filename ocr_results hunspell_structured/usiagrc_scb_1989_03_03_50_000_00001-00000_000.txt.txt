Harris Center plans upgraded
Trustee meeting looks to future

by Stephen Hardwick

The board of trustees added
100 seats, a courtyard, limestone
accents, and neon lights to the
plan of the proposed Harris stu-
dent centcr during their meeting
in Naples, Florida. last weekend.
The trustees also approved the
college‘s operating budget and
faculty promotions. However,
the main locus of the meetings
was general discussion about the
future of the college.

Professor 1m Strauber, who
attended the meetings said, “My
impression is that nothing mate-
rial was supposed to come out of
it. nothing substantive, nothing
ofa position paper or a policy or
a set of guiding principles. That
was not the purpose of the meet-
ing. The purpose was to ex—
change ideas and representations
of what the college is and what it
ought to be.“

Executive Vice~PrcsiClent
Waldo Walker said that the
trustees spent more of their time
on general discussion than on
specific items. “Most of the
agenda was taken up with dis
cussion of long-range planning
for the collcgwhow best the
college can manage its resources
and how most responsibly we can
apply those resources to the mis-
sion of the college, which is the
education of students." he said.
The trustees hold a general dis
cussion of Grinnell’s strengths
and weaknesses, Among the
many topics discussed were cur-
ricular revision and the need for
more money for library acquisi~
tions.

The trustees also discussed
the need to significantly upgrade
Grinnell's mainframe computer
system in the next 20 months.

In the vice-presidential race,
Tyler was elected by a margin of
over 58 percent of the votes. Her
479 Votes more titan doubled the
229 votes for Jclfl Fields. Matt

Walker said the cost would be
approximately 81.1 to 51.4 mil-
lion. The board examined the
possibility of adding another
dormitory to increase the total
space available for housing as
well as to remove the pressure to
place students in certain off-camr
pus college—owned houses.
Walker said that the quality of
some of {host} houses “isn‘t
terribly great.”

Although the meetings fo-
cused on the exchange of ideas,
they did not Consist entirely of
general discussions. The trustees
approved the following items:

-An $84,729 addition to
Burling's current $609,970
acquisitions budget, bringing the
total acquisitions budget to
$694,700 for l989790.

Comprehensive fee

jumps to

by Dave Jones

The Grinnell College com-
prehensive fee will increase by
over $1,000, bringing the cost to
$15,088 for the 1989-90 school
year. This represents a 7.5 per
cent increase over the fee for the
present academic year.

"We tried to keep it at low as
we could this year," said George
Drake, Grinnell College presi-
dcnt, who today sent a letter to
all students and their parean or
guardians detailing the increase.

, Despite the size of the raise,

Drake said the increase is small
when compared to comparable
institutions. "Most institutions
are going higher than 7.5 per-
cent," he said.

Arms control
to lecture on

Strobe Talbott, the
Washington bureau chief of Time
magazine and an internationally
recognized authority on American

Talbert will give a talk on
“Arms Control: Until Now. the
Only Game in Town” at 8 pm.

also deliver a Scholars‘
Convocation lecture titled
“Gorbachev and Bush: It‘s A
Whole New Ball Game” at ll
am. on Thursday, March 9.

cipal writer and reporter on na-
tional-security affairs and foreign
policy. He has interviewed

Drake cited it rise in the col-
lege‘s operating cosLs as the rea-
son [or the increase. "There are
also several areas of the budget
that have increased at a higher
rate than the comprehensive fee
increase," he said. The total exr
penditure for faculty salaries. for
example, will increase by more
than 7.5 percent next year.

Drake pointed out in his ex-
planatory letter that despite the
increase, the comprehensive fee
only pays for 55 percent of "what
it costs to provide a Grinnell
education." By contrast, students
at Carleton College pay 67 per
cent of the cost of their educa-
tions.
