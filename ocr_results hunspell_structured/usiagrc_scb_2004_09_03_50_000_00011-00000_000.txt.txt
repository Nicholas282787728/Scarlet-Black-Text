Opinion editor plans for more
substance, less suckinesss in section

By JASON RATHOD
As the college's ofﬁcial newspaper,
the Sﬂ‘fBis designed to reﬂect the sens

timents and report the
events of the campus
community. The opin-
ion section, speciﬁcally,
provides the campus at
Wake to share its views
:on a wide range of
: matters.
My job as opinion
editor is to provide an
inclusive and appropri»

While housing humorous column
nists and entertaining rants, the page
has neglected more substantive dise
course.To ensure
that this does not
happen again, 1
am making a few
changes.

First, the page
will be hosting a
“staff editorial."
1n the weekly ed-
itorial, the star?
editorial board

“Grinnell’s ‘peer institu-
tions' have all adopted
[staff editorials] on their
opinion pages. It is high
time that we do the
same?“

ing matters, we hope to promote aware-
ness and spark constructive discourse
among students, raculty and adminisr
trators. To invoke the rhetoric of our
beloved board of trustees, Grinnell’s
“peer institutions" have all adopted this
component on their opinion pages. It is
high time that we do the same.
Second, I am formally encouraging
all staff, {acuity and administrators to
submit guest columnsThese people all
possess an untapped wealth of experi
once with the college that, if expressed,
would certainly beneﬁt the rest ofus.

SGA or campus groups, will also and
a home on the opinion pageAs always,
the general student body should also
feel welcome to submit guest columns
throughout the year.

It is important to note that these
changes will not COmC at the expense
of features that have previously domi-
nated the opinion page. In short, my
section won’t suck. Random rants, Llie
snedge and letters to the editor will all
remain in full force. With this in mind,
your input on changes to the we are
much appreciated.

Longing for summer isolation

Welcome back to school, Grinnell college
students. We’re so happy to have you. But things
change as surnrner ends. The summer went like
this~Saturday mornings at an almost empty Saint’s
Rest, biking home behind your old Latin teacher,
walking to work with your nose buried in a paper~
back it's 2i cozy little town for three months
and then Your cars bombarding our eiirply
parking lots‘. your packages ﬁlling up the niailrooml
your voices and stereo; and rootstens booming
across the once peaceful campus! I didn’t. think
I was one for quiet isolation, but your return has
proved the wrong, Don't worry, 1 am glad you are
back, and I was surprised to feel such an irrational
ownership of Grinnell, but it was weird there for a
little bit. So next time, trickle in slowly, and make
many peace olferings to the "summer people." Just
in case.

Why Fe!" for campus center?

Is it me, or is Grinnell College slowly becoming
Cesar Pelli Univ.? One thing I learned while working
at er top architecture ﬁrm this summer is that my
personal opinion is well shared: Pelli's architecture
'5 well bland. Kuala lanipur's Petwrras Towers
stand out only in height, and besides New York Lity's
World Financial Center, he hasn't done anything
worth being beddzzled ever, And while I’m a huge
fan of the renovation or the arts building, have you
seen the design for the new campus center? Sonrer
body please yell ”mediocrity," and don't even gel the
stdited with the color scheme! If we really wanted to
Show oil how incredibly endowed we are, we should
he dilierenl well known architects for major build-
ing projects rather than one. That would create an
architecturally diverse, more interesting campus »
one deserving orloe Rosenrielri's legacy.

Given only 142 words

At ﬁrst, this sounded like a pretty sweet deal. I
get to write a rant about Whatever I want, and the
paper will print it for everyone to see. Sign me up,
I thought. then they dropped the other shoe. “142
words!” I yelled, with a lew nonrprintable words
sandll'ithed around there. ”Or less,” they pointed out
helpfully hanks, friend," I added, except I didn't
say 'trierrtr.’ Honestly, though, what can I say in 142
words? Then 1 gal it. Th r were trying to haze the
ileshie. Well, i'rn no pl r, and I won't be stand—
ing hit this. My opinions will be heard, and no marks
errhappy editor is going to quash that rundarrrental
American right. Otherwise, 1 might as well just go
live in some nameless country with a totalitarian
government but I'm sure honorable people. ‘lessir, I’d
like to see...
