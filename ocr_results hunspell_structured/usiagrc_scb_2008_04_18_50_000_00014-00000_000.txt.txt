Providing information about the cameras

Lack of information

Many students were justifiably surprised
rind disturbed when we returned from
spring Break to ﬁnd a pair ofsecuriry came
eras in the mailroom.

Self—governance should offer a campus

Avhere students take responsibility for their
own behavior rather than living under con»
srant and overbearing administration ovcr—
sight. Being irlrrred as we go about our daily
business would seem to threaten that.

Our opinion changed a little when we
were told that
the cameras
were put up
to help in the
i n v e s t i g it ~
tion into the
heinous anti—
queer hate
mail that was
sent out be-
fore break. Like everyone, we want that inr
vestigation to succeed and ﬁnd the person

responsible, and in the direct prr uir of that
goal we're willing to accept things— rke sur—
veillance cameras—that we would ordinarily
regard skeptically.

Brit what we at the
SEI‘B have trouble acceprr
ing is the lack of tlilnS'
patency concerning those
cameras.

The administration
made no attempt to EXT
plain to students why they
felt the cameras were net

essary.
The only informa-
tion the student body has
received has been in re-
sponse to spccifrc student
requests from the Sid}?
and SGA, including ad-
ditional information dis-
closed in a guest column
in this week’s SUB by
SGA Vice President for Student Affairs jan
Koszewski '08 (see page 13),

0ft0urxe, there tau/d be good reasons for
ietrety, We’re not privy to the facts oft/re “‘8
invest/gallon and we’re willing to rake me
administraiian’i word for ll.

Students at large were not even told that
the cameras were related to the hate mail
until the SSE interviewed Elena Bernal
about them.

We feel that
as students, we
reasonable
about the “e,
cessities of an
investigation,

But we
don’t want to be
stoncweilled and
told to avoid “the knee-jerk Big Brother re-
action."

Of courser there could be good reasons
for secrecy We’re not privy to the facts of
the investigation and we’re willing to take
the administration’s word for rt.

Had Bernal told students, in an e—mail
or through the Sﬂsz, that “We have a very
good reason for putting up these cameras,
but due to the investigation we can’t disclose
that right now.

Water bottles

As I'm sure you've heard from a self-
righrcous, bleeding-heart friend at one point
or another, bottled water is bad. Bad isn’t the
most descriptive word in the world, butl like it
because it begs the question- how bad?

In 2006 the Paciﬁc Institute estimated that
producing the botrles that Americans used for
water cost 17 million barrels of oil. The ratio
ofwater used in manufacturing to water in the
final product ranges from three liters to six li—
ters per single-liter bottle. This doesn’t count
the cost of transportation either, which, for
a brand like Fiji, is half the wholesale price.
Many sources of bottled water aren’t sustain—
able. Bortling plants are removing water from
the source far faster than it can be replenished.
Despite all this, though, water is still churned
out by the truckload. Americans drank 31.2
billion liters ofbottled water in 2006. 31.2 bile
lion is a really, really big number.

Consider all the little things that added up
to that hilariously large ﬁgure. Did you carry
a bottle of water around to classes? Maybe
you bought some to take with you on a walk
Do you get water when you brry food? These
numbers add up terrifyingly quickly.

It might seem ridiculous to be worrying
about water after we’ve just been snowed and
rained on for the past four months straight,
but that rs just the point. Why would you need
to get your water from somewhere else? Iowa
has an abundance of water at the moment.
You mrgirt cvcn say that we have water our
the hirssrssrppr. Thc solution to your thirst
shouldn’t be drinking water that was shipped
halfway around the world.

Small steps are surprisingly easy to rake:
lct's talk specifics. Buy a warcrlrorrlcl Ifyou're
worncd about the safety of Nalgcrrcs, buy a
Klean KnntecrL chan Kantoeirs arc str nless
steel canteens made in closely monitored fac-
turics to ensure the ﬁnal producr is as ecoe and
people-friendly as possrblc. Furthermore, they
don't absorb flavors. So, unlike your Naigenc,
you can keep liquids besides water in rhcm. if
you have [0 buy bottled water, get a local non-
narne brand to minimize transportation costs.

lfyou don't like the warcr in your dorm—
I’m certainly not irnprcssed with East D’s
water—pick up a Brita water pitcher to keep
ﬁlled for access to water whenever you need
it Keep in rniird that it is not necessary for
you to bc constantly sipping on a bottle ofwrv
rcr, cirhcr, Remember eight glasses ofwater a

day? Nobody knows where rhar came from,
There has been a good deal of recent research
showing that all you should do is drink when
you’re thirsty.

Just a few days ago, Nestle purchased the
rights to pump hundreds ofmillions of gallons
from a droughrrsrrickcn state park in Florida.
They have rights to this warer until 2018, lr
cost them 5236.11) compliment our outrar
geously large number before, here is a n y ouc.
i know, as Grrnriellians, we’re too smart to buy
into this kind of tomfoolery, Get yourself a
water bottle for this summer and start taking
steps in the right direction,

For E. Palmer

The article “Carroll and Palmer ready for
third faceoff” in last week’s edition was not
fully illustrative ofthe accomplishments made
by Palmer as our representative.

In a single term, Eric Palmer has done
more for our district and the state oflowa than
Carroll did rn his 12 years in the legislature.
Mrrch of Palmer's work has beneﬁted college
students, such as legislation allowrrrg parents
to keep kids on their healthcare until age 25.

Palmer has made due on his promises from
his last campaign. Last fall, Palmer madc raise
ing minimum wage a high priority The Dome
ocratic lcgislanrrc passed a bill to raise m
mum wage rn rlrc opcnrng weeks nfcorrgre .

Eric Palmer has stood up for c. r rrglrts
and cqunlity, including outlawing discr-rnrr-
nation against rhc GLBT community Last
spring, Palmer- along with the Dcmociatic lcg-
islature helped pass a srgnrfrcrrnr anti-bullying
law. The law aims to prevent buhying based on
traits or characteristics, including scxual orien-
tation and gender identity. With strong Re—
publican oppositron, the Democratic legislator
was key to passing this law.

We don’t want to roll back on the progress
that we've made in the last two years. Thrs is
why we’re going to support Eric Palmer this
fall.

Remembering

It happened when 1 was in second grade.
The entire school shook violently, accompir
nied by the most immense eruption of noise

one can imagine, All ofus screamed and won-
dered aloud about what the hell happened.

It's now almost seven years after 9/11. and
people still talk about it all the time. Thc event
surfaces in the media literally cvcry day, Words
like “Muslim." “lslamicqvorld” and “Islamo-
fascism" have suddenly entered the American
lcxrcon. all, of course, carryrng a pejorative
connotation.

By now, we are all used to the ugly noises
politicians ruakc in reference to this gruesome
attackThcy too pitch accuse one another of
being “unrAmcrican,” or undemocratic, or
some variation thcrcof

And I may be being naive, and this sort or
quibbling may be an incvrrablc consequence or
such an irnpacrful oventt But rlrcrc was, indeed,
short nmc when we weren’t bickering, when
we all just hoped and prayed;wc knew that to-
gather we would overcome tlus tragedy

Likewise, the Community response in etc
was one of the most touching moments in
American history. I have never met a resident
ofrhe city who didn't in sortie way aid the re-
lrcfcfforr. Whether it meant donating money,
volunteering at the sire or laying a bouquet of
ﬂowers at the botron of the metal fence sur-
rounding the remrr rs or what once was the
Alfred B Murray chcnrl Building, you'd be
hard pressed to find an Oklahoman who didn't
do one ofthc above.

Oklahoma City also reveals something
about terrorism that we often overlook that
terrorism and vrolcrrcc don’t cxelusrvcly per taiu
to nnc’s race, religion, ethnic group, natrorralr
ity, or region. In this case, the perpetrator of
the terror was lr white American, not a Mus
lim from the Middle East Recently. a fifteen
yearrold boy in Los Arrgcles was shot whilc
at school because he was gay, Like rhc aforo
mennonerl catastrophies. this was also an act
oftcrror,only with a dirfcrcnrvicnur and r dif»
ferent aggressor.

There‘s no logic in reacting to a tragedy by
scapegoatiug an Clinic group ofpcnplc. Ter-
rorism can happen anywhere, and .r terrorist
may be ofany background

Tomorrow is the rlrirtccnrh .rrrnrvcrsary of
the bomb. Ifyoii can, get a hold ofa ribbon and
wear it proudlyl hope that we might be able to
put as de cur pnliticking tor a day, and remernr
bcr rhc way we responded to rhosc events, rhc
way we loved roral Stratigcrs,alid that by com
ing together, a community can prevail even in
the most hoirendoiis circumstances.
