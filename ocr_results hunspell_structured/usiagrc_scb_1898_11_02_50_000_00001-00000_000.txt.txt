Grinnell Institute.

Grinnell Institute held one of
the most interesting and encour-
aging meetingslast Saturday even»
ing that it has held this year.
Every number on the program
showed preparation. study and
thought. It is in this very fact
that thc secret of good. prosper-
ous. bencﬁctal society woil: lies.
A society may have members tip
to its limit and each and every
member may have more than the
ordinary talent in the line or soci-
ety ivork. yet without thoughtful.
earnest preparation society work
falls flat and becomes iii-iintei-est»

such that each member would rea»
lize that the individual numbcr
cost some ettort, Then and only
then will the value of the work be
realized out of it and fully appre-
ciated.

The debate was, undutibtcdly.
the one feature of the evening’s
program which excelled anything

we may attribute its excellence to
the very tact of full preparation.

In the externporarreous work

siderable ability to gr sp the main
particulars with regard to a sub»
ject and to deliver them in an ac~
ceptable manner.
