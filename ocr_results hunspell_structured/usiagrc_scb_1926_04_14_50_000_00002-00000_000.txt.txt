THE my . "(AGE Lam “CARRIES 0N."

Thirty»two years ago the Scarlet and Black made its
initial bow to the Grinnell campus. In the editorial sec-
tion 01‘ the ﬁrst issue, a small four column paper, was
stated a brief Explanation of the editorial policy of the
publication. These are a few exeel‘pts from that early
edition:

”The main effort at this publication is fully to repre-
sent the growing interests of the college along many
lines .....

“We wish to make SCARLET AND BLACK truly a
student’s pilpelx W'e shall aim fairly to represent and
recognize the interests of the college in furnishing news
or only that oi interest to the subscribers and all ot
interest.

“In all its departments a strict regard tor truth will
be mninained ......

“ire desire and shall aim to antagonize no organi—
zation oi the college, and if our efforts succeed no ri-iction
will result,"

As the management embarks today in charge at the
thirty—third voyage ot the SCARLET AND BLACK, it is
worthy to hesitate fl. moment and realize the actual ful»
nllment of those original principles in the work or the
predecessors

Those are the some fundamental motives that the
new management will strive to execute, Accuracy of
news, tolerance and conservatism of. editorials and an
eager desire to he or service in the promotion or every—
thing good for the college might well be set forth as
speciﬁc aims, but those are not new ideals; they are the
identical gasls towards which the predecessors have
striven.

True enough. through the cooperation of the student
body and the rsculty, the SCARLET AND BLACK serves
as a’digest, a common meeting ground upon which every—
body can voice his opinion and otter suggestions on
relevant questions, but the use of that opportunity rests
entirely upon the students and faculty memhers. Cer-
tainly, the use of the “What Do You Think”
column can not be urged the strongly.

And so as the new management sets out today, it
feels a thrill of pride in the work of the past and

{I‘Hli IlOZtlE ('DNClilt'l' ADMISSION CHARGE.

)lc‘ e audiences have greeted singers in the home
concerts or both Grinnell glee clubs.’ A condition of
non»attcndauce has resulted to such a degree that students
on both sides of the campus have begun to quesuon the
general theory of the home concert.

Ask any member of either club what reception he was
given by thc students when he tried to sell tickets. He
met with few blank refusals. More often the answer was.
“I know the concert will be good. Grinnell glee clubs
are the best in the west, but I do hate to spend the
seventyrﬁve cents. I! I do decide to go, I'll let you
To these statements the club member could say

nothing, for there was a ring of truth in every word.

know."

Had some inquiring reporter made a, tour of the
dormitories and the quadrangle on the night I)? the
last concert, he could very easily have gotten hundreds
semester tee. Students are glad to lend their moral suns
[)Ol‘t to the clubs, but (if ﬁnancial strength they can
giro but a small portion.

That the glee clubs should lose money on the home-
concerts ol" that regular numbers of the School of Music
recital course should he eliminated, is desired by no one.
A plan which would embody neither of these undesirable
features and yet furnish tickets to both concerts for a
minimum charge would be a. heg step forward.

Here is such a plan: add ﬁfty cents annual charge to
each semester tee, twentysﬁve cents to be apportioned to
each club. Eight hundred semester fees would allow
contributions of two hundred dollars to each treasury.
In such an amount as much as recent home concerts have
totaled? Figures suhmitted by the treasurers at both
organizations show that the amount to be gained under
such a plan exceeds the sum made by either club in the
last.concert. It is Worth noting that if this plan were
adopted no more soliciting nEed be done, {or there would
be an annual budget on which each club could depend.
On it purely monetary basis, then, the plan its sound.

The real reason for advancing such a. plan is not
primarily to assure the treasurles DE ft stated income.
although that is a natural result. Rather, the pllrpﬂse is
to allow every student in college to have the privilege
of attending two affairs of El. strictly allecollege nature

Glee Clubs represent Gl‘innell its much as do football

EDITORIALS OF THE DAY.

THE “PRAYING HAWKS."

At last! Here is one Way the Northwestern athletes
have missed their quest for athletic prowess. The
Hawkeye basketball team attributes to prayer its claim to
the Big Ten title,

Minnesota Was the only team between the Hawks
and the title. As the boys sat together in a room o[
the Andrews hotel they offered up a. prayer that they
might win the game. As they ﬁnished due 0[ the more
devout opened a Bible and read: “Have faith for they who
have taiLh, their prayers shall be answered.”

And says the University paper: “The boys on the Iowa
team will truthfully admit if asked that it was their faith
and prayer that helped them to become Big Ten
champions."

It would have been interesting to have seen what
would have happened if the boys had let it go at prayer.
It's a pretty good guess that some effective guarding,
lightning passing, and superior teamwork played about
as big a part as any prayer meeting could ever have done.
