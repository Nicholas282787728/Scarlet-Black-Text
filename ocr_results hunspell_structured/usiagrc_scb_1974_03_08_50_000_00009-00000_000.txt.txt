It was the social event ol the sea-
son. it had everything that one co-
uld ever want at a bridal show-r
silverware, chinaware, crystal, a
trip to Florida,a prophilactic sales-
man, drag queens, a Dean of Sin»
dents, transvestites and streakers.
What else could one ask loi"?

Loose Hall was the place. Wedn-
esday night was the time. It start-
ed out as a nice, quiet event but
turned out to be the “happening”
oi the year, or at least oi the week.
Twyla Meyers, representing Future
Enterprises and a periect size ei—

everyone, but it was obvious that
Dave “The Rave” Shaffer and Jon»

I've seen on this campus in along
time, David has his lushious golden
curls done in a most sensuous
manner Jonathan, in his imported
Italian racing shirt attempted to
“pick-up" sweet Twyla, but to no

when Dan Spero won a free Flori-
