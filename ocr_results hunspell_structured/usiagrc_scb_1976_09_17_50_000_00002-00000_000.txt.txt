Costa-Rican 2.
program a;

by Debbie Weiner

Senior Rameen Armajani spent
his last semester in a dilapidated
“pre-Columbian" house built out
stilts on a beach. He and 24 Cum-
panions learned to function in a
tropical environment with no
plumbing, frequent floods, straw
beds equipped with rats, monkeys
in the back yard, two earthquakes
and virtual isolation frog
“civilization." These experienc
were part oi a “valuable and
rewarding” semester spent in
Costa Rica in the ACM’s Costa
Rica Field Program. ’5

The purpose of the program,
which will be held again next
semester, is to Conduct extensive
field work in archaeology. Ar~
majani, the only Grinnell student
participating last year, and 20
other participants were guided by
three advisers and a field director.
The primitive living conditions
included nightly iloodings at high
tide, and a tropical climate that
offers six months of ‘00 degree
plus temperatures during the dry
season. Looking at it from a
positive viewpoint, says Armaja ' t
the students live through “3
months of tanning Weather.”

The students formed

a co-op arrangement, sharin
chores which included cooki. T
chopping firewood, and haulii!
water irom a tempermenta] out-
door pump. Work atnight was done
by candlelight. The house was
“pretty well isolated,” with all
transportation conducted on dirt
roads. The students didn't do much
traveling, and spent much of their
time with the local people.

“Contact with the local people
was a valuable part oi the
program,” commented Rameen.
The group also took full advant e
oi the local bar, which happened
be located on the ground iloor oi
their house (the house was bought
by the ACM under the condition
that the bar remain intact), R ”X

and roomrlemperature beer ,
provided a common link between

the students and the Costa Ricans,

During the daytime, the students
got the chance to apply their
“textbook knowledge” to the
practical work at archaeology.
Activities ranged from simple
tasks such as straight shoveling
to the use or comprehensive lab
techniques, The grounds provided
a wealth oi artifacts, some dam:
back to 300 B.C. ‘.

In Considering the value of the
program, Armajani stressed t e
unique and practical aspects r ‘

terests fostered close relationships
among the “.25 strangers thrown
together in the tropics." They
shared experiences, problems, and
ideas in a novel. remote and often
d’ icult situation. Total
immersion in a folk culture
through contact with the natives
was also immeasurably valuable.
“The different envxronment is
essential. , . . you really learn a lot

The practice or archaeology atw
gave Rameen a “better un-
derstanding or who we are.”

The ACM offers two programs in
Costa Rica ior undergraduates.
The spring term is devo
primarily to field work, while the
fall term is more oriented
toward Spanish language and

Costa Rican scene, and to the study
of contemporary Costa iiican
