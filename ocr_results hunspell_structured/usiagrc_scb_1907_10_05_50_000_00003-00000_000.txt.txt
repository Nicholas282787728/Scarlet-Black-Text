A GREAT MUSICAL OFFERING.

It will not be tho fault of Director
G. L. Pierce 0! the School of Music,
it the people of Grinnall do not hear
the greatest collection of musical
talent ever Dilated hers. Certainly I
ﬁner opportunity to listen to artists or
worldwide reputation could not ho
had than will be aﬁelded here through
the recital course this year.

In arranging for the course Mr.
Pierce has proceeded-m the theory thlfl
the people ofGrinnell would rather
have the privilege of hearing a. low of
the most famous artists than to have
alarge number of recitals by almost
unknown musicians. For this reason
he has spared neither expense nor
pains in arranging 3. course which will
bring to Grinnell during the year, no
lesser lights in the musical ﬁrmament
than Gogcrza, the great Spanish bari-
tone, Katherine Goodson, the London
pianist, who swept the east by storm
last year when playing with the Bos-~
ton and New York orchestras, Carlo
Fischer, the Well known 'ccllo soloist,
and Sihyl Sammis, a. soprano with ac
ﬁne reputation.

In addition the stlougesb collection
of musical talent, ever gotten together
in the School of Music, will contribute
to the delight and strength of tho
programs. With such excellent solo-
ists as Miss Berth Shoots, pianist and
Violinist, who won favor at her ﬁrst
appearance here two years ago,
Richard K. Davis, the baritone who
lppsared to such excellent zdvsutsge
at. the Congregational church two
weeks ago, Miss A. Rosalie Holberg,
whose advance notices have led music
lovers to looki‘orward with keen antlr
eipstions to her public appearances,
and ﬁnally but by no means leash‘
Prof. E. B. Shave,

warm and wide-spread I popularity as

who enjoys as

any musician who ever llvsd here-
there is no doubt that the ﬁne foreign
talent will to wall seconded by 'local
musicians.

The remarkable thing in connection
With this big undertaking is that
Direct/0r Pierce has decided on oiror
the season tickets for the old popullr
price of $1.50 in order to put it in the
range or all, Dates and further de-
tails will be announced litter. This
should be enough, however, to arouse
the keenest interest among Glinnell
lovers of music.
