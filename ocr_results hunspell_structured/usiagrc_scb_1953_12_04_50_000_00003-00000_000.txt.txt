Bbard Acts Upon
Mid-Sem Grades:
To Issue Warnings

Thirteen students from this
year’s freshman class have "been

placed on academic probation:
76 other students ’have received

academic warnings.

All grades of freshmen and
new students, which were below
the 2.00 or C level, were studied
last' Friday .at a meeting of the
Personnel hoard.

At the regular grading periods,
the board reviews the students
records and places those with
two or more current failures on
academic probation. The board
issues academic warnings to
thbse students who have an
average below C.

Students put on probation will
remain so until formally re-
leased by vote of the board,
which is generally made at the
close of a semester.

The board feels that there
were quite a few low grades at
this time, but are optimistic that
the list will be shorter in

sunvn snows

Last year a survey of leading colleges
throughout the country showed that
smokers in those colleges preferred
Luckies to any other cigarette.

This year another nation-wide survey
ibased on thousands of actual student
interviews, and. representative of all
students in regular Collegesishows that
Luckies lead again over all brands, regu—
lar or king size .,,and by a wide margin.l
The No. 1 reason: Luckies taste better.

Smoking enjoyment is all a matter of
taste, and the fact of the matter is Luckles
ta? betterefor 2 reasons. L.S./M.E.T.
—Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. And
Luckies are made better to taste better.
So, Be HappymGo Lucky!

It’s easier than you think to
make 525 by writing a Lucky
Strike jingle like those you see
in this ad. Yes, we need jingle:
—and we pay $25 for every one

we use! So send as many as you
