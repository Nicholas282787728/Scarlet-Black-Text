MASON CITY MAN SPEAKER

A musical pr-ogrurn that would hate
done credit to some or the best profess
siantl talent iii the country. and au
excellently delil’ei‘etl address by Rev.
Mr. \Velch, ot the First Congregational
church at Mason Citl'l characterized
the Vespers senice last Sunday.

The speaker chose as his subject
one which never rails to interests stu-
dents, “The Spirit at Amhition and
Aspiration." He said in part: “To
succeed is to do the thing you are cre
ated to do. Success lies. not in achive-
iiig what you aim at, but in aiming at
what you ought to achieve. Aspiration
is the quest tor the hest; it is the
center or core oi Christianity. Finally,
alter diagging amhition hetorc Gotl
arid tcsting it, we ﬁnd that success,
satcti'. satiiaotioii, salvation—all are
found in the one word, ‘Alnhitién.'”
In closing hc quoted a stanza from
"The Cllﬂlllliei'etl Ndlllill which lie—
gins: “Btliltl tlrcc iuorc stalcly main
