The w. R. A. board last night
voted 6-1 in favor of the tradi-
tionnl women's dance intramural
set for Saturday night, Feb. 7/0,
thus cancelling an cicvcnthhour
movement on the pan of a quad-
ranglo group to suspend the pro-
gram in favor of an all-school
Sports night.

Explaining tho proposed plan,
Faith Weis, Haines sophomore,
who headed the movement, listed
lack of time for practice, and pri—
orities of war activities of st —
dents as motives for an entertai —
ment requiring little preparation.

The plan, suggested to Marga—
ret Carey, Main senior, and
W. n. A. board chairman, yester-
day, was first defeated in a ver-
bal poll of the board,

Aftel' consultation with Miss
Clara Julia Anderson, women-s
physical education director, how-
ever, a formal hearing of the
Sports Night idea was secured for
last night, at which time it was
again outvoted.

The scheme would have utilized
activities already functioning on
campus, thus eliminating prace
ticc time for those cottages not
wishing to prepare a dance pro»
gram. A basketball game between
a cottage and a hall, a badminton
exhibition by Dean and Mrs. Shel—
ton L. Beatty and Mr .and Mrs.
Grant 0. Gale, a demonstration
of conditioning classes, and the
possible play—off of men’s intra—
mural basketball would have been
featured, Miss Weis said.

“We feel that we have been
treated very fairly in presenting
our idea,” Miss Weis said last
night following the second board
meeting. "However, the board
apparently did misunderstand that
our plan was not 3. partisan cot—
tage idea, but one intended to in-
elude the entire school and one
which we thought was in accord
impossible,” she said.

Special arrangements to grant

reservists called to service were

made yesterday in a special
meeting of the registrar's adviso-
ry committee.

The college rule of granting
oneriourth credit to men com—
pleting the fourth week or the

give dist amount of credit to air
corps men attending classes

Bethana McCandlcss, registrar
said.

Men leaving- school before that
time will bc given no credit for
this semester, sho said.

Seniors with 112 hours credit,
who have completed their coin-
prehensivcs, will bc granted their
degrees as if they were in the
last half of the final semester of
their senior year. This rule will
apply to Dean Hess, Robert

hensives, will be allowed to trans.
fer their hours from air school

12 of these men had already
received their individual or-
ders and are planning to leave
Gl‘illnell Shortly.

Although the loss represents ap-
proxrniatcly ten per cent of the
men enrolled in Grinnell, thc col-
lege is not planning any change
in the present revised housing set-
up, Beatty said. Instead present
overcrowding in halls will be re-
lieved by the withdrawal of these
reservists.

The loss by halls falls chiefly
upon Read and GatcsSmith, With
nine and seven men subject to
call respectively. Dibble has two
and Rawson one. while the Town—
men Wlll lose four.

In the case of at least two of‘
the men, there is a possibility that
