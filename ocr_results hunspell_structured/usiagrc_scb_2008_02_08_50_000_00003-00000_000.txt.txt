After five years of planning and construcr
tion, the Science Center Renovation Project is
nearly complete. The second and last phase of
the project, which moved closer to completion
this week, included remodeling of the build
ing’s side racing south campus, as well as new
construction throughout the
rest of the building. Perhaps
most importantly to students
on south campus, the walkway
between Read .md Noyce has
been restored.

As a part of the curient
project called Phase-2 by Hol»
abird 8!. Root, the architecture
firm in charge of the project,
the eastern Wing and entrance
to Noyce were finally reopened
iii the end oflast semester.

Other renovations have included numer-
ous physical additions to the thirdrﬂoor math
and computer science wing, such as new class
rooms,computcr labs, and commons areas.The
building’s first major project, named Phase-1
by Holabird 8c Root, was a threeryear renovar
tion of the Bowen Hall of Science, which was
ﬁnished in 1997.

The 344.3 million Phaserz project was
funded both by ﬁlndraising efforts and by the
college’s capital reserve fund, which is man-
aged by the trustees and allocated to such
large-scale projects.

The majority of the project's price tag for
the second phase has been paid, money is still
being raised to pay for the remainder.

Holabird at Root designed the building
and worked closely with the college to ensure
that all project requirements were met. “There
were challenges," said Vice President for Acat
demic Affairs and Dean of the College Jim
swartz, who has also been the main supervi—
sor of the project. “But having a good design
process allowed for
success within the
constiaints." The
project is currently
three months ahead
of schedule.

Swam said the
renovation planners
considered more
than just academic
needs in the design
of the renovations
and hoped to make

the building more accommodating, “Like the
Joe Rosent‘ield Center, it is meant to be a good
community building space to encourage stu-
dents and faculty to interact," he said,

Although members of the campus com,
munity acknowledge the benefits of renovar
tions, students and professors alike have been
inconvenienced by closed stairwells and other
obstructions.“Well, it’s a good chance to make
jokes," said sam Rebelsky, computer science.

Despite the inconveniences caused by con-
struction,such as late students and a file server
crash in August, “it’s worth a little inconver
nience to have nice spaces for the long term,”
he said.

tions were "kind of a nuisance,“ in navigat-
ing the building, but that the payoff was well

worth it. “I love the new computer facilities,”

he said.
With the new additions, the college antici-
pates the building will be usable well into the

school's future.“[Noyce] will have to be adaph

will be," said Swartz. “Your children will have
to report if we were successful,"

College mini grants seek to strengthen Grinnell community

BYMATT ZMuoltA

Last year, the Poweshiek Animal League Shelter received
51000 to help pay veterinary bills for injured animals, the
Learning Garden Preschool secured 51670 for computer soft
ware, and Grinnell Area Arts Council got $1000 for art stip-
plies and tuition help. All of these grants were made through
Grinnell College’s Community MinitGrants program which
is once again preparing to review applicants for the next round
of grants.

“There is always the possibility of the college appearing as
the soc-pound gorilla [in Grinnell]," said Amy l<alkbrenner,
Interim Director of Community Development. Wirh a few
strategically placed grants, the college hopes to challenge that
perception and strengthen ties between the school and the
community.

Over the next week the Grinncll College Ofﬁce of Com-
munity Enhancement will be receiving applications for projects
to “strengthen the college and community,” according to the
program descriptionThe program, now in its eighth year, dis»
tributes small grants ranging from $500 to $5000 to assist local
non-profit organizations and to develop projects in the city of
Grinnell aimed at improving the community. This year’s dead—
line for applications to Grinnell's community Mini-Grants

program is Feb 15.

Each year, nine or ten projects receive funding from the pro-
gram, which last year distributed nearly 520,000 to local groups.
“It’s supposed to help the community achieve small to midtlevel
projects which are either new initia-
tives or infrastructure," Kalkbrennct
said. She is the program's interim dis
rector while Monica Chavez—Silva is
on leave.

These minirgrants are the only
funding of their kind in the area.
The Ahrcns Foundation funds
larger projects, while the Poweshiek
County Alliance, supported by Iowa
gambling proﬁts, has a county-wide
focus.

“We look at itiis it different who it will touch in the
community, does it meet the primary goals of the program?"
Kalkbrenner said. "The Community Mini-Grants program is
looking for [projects in] the community of Grinnell,” such as
a book giveaway at Music in the Park conecrts, which received
a mini-grant.

Cleveland students face rodent

BYANCELA Cao

Roommates Asha Holsopple ’11 and Anna Ford ’11 re
turned from a well-rested winter break to a clean dorm room—
and a new roommate.Their new tenant, whom they affections
ately began to refer to as Goober, came for their food and began
climbing on top oftheir dresseis and desks to
snag candy bars, chips, sandwiches and any-
thing else in reach. Goober was a mouse.

l—Iolsopple and Ford werent the only 5hr
dents with'such unwelcome visitors. Mice have
appeared in rooms all over Cleveland Hall,
from the pit to the third ﬂoor. The first com,
plaints started arriving at the end of last semes—
ter and by the end ofWinter Break amounted
to a fullrﬂedged infestation.

Despite the serious inconvenience and potential health
problems, it took two weeks of complaints before Facilities
Management (FM) seriously Confront the problem orthe mice
which still run rampant throughout the dorm.

Frustration built up slowly. Folsopple and Ford first tried to
hide their food in hopes that the mice simply would go away.

”Sleeping at night was impossible »
Allyuu could hear was Goober
scurrying through the room.”

But despite the lack of food, the mice still remained. “Slccpt
ing at night was impossible," said Holsopple. “All you could
hear was Goober scurrying through the room, making rufﬂing
noises as it searched aimlessly for food."

Other snidents quickly raised their own concerns. In the
pit, Maia Larson ’11 repeatedly witnessed
an unwanted sleeping buddy on her pillow.
On Cleveland First, roommates Evan Fer-
rier ’09 and Van Kenyon ’10 have already
caught four mice with their own mouser
traps.

The problem appears to be unprec-
edented. VanessaTaylor, the Jamaland RLC
said that in ”six years here, mice have never
really been an issue."

“It’s been an incredibly cold winter this year and the cold
may be pushing the mice into the dorms,"Taylor said.

Dean for Student Life jennifcr Krohn agreed that this was
an unusual problem, remembering only one prior incident of
rodent infestation. She also cited the cold weather and said that
residents of the town she knows have also mentioned seeing

According to both Chamberland and Kalk-
brenner, the program has been extremely sucr
cessful. “It deﬁnitely has had a positive impact,"
Chamberland said, while Kalkbrenuer pointed to the rising
number of applications 19 as of last year.

515000 from the college budget are currently set aside for
the Community Mini Grants, but Kalkbrenner is always on
the lookout to expand the program. ”We did ask for an addi-
tional budget in the past school year, but thatwas not granted,"
she said. “We'll try again.”

mice in their homes,

Thus far, Cleveland is the only dorm to report a major
mouse problem, though one student in Haines also complained
to Student Affairs.

Cleveland residents complained about how long it took for
a response to the issue. Once Goober started leaving feces on
the floor and little “chocolate treats" on their pillows, Ford was
forced to take her complaints to Student Advisers, Jamaland
RLC Vanessa Taylor, FM and Student Affairs before help at—
rived.

Krohn said that the administration acted promptly when it
received complaints but that they are limited by the schedule of
the college's pest control company She expressed sympathy for
students feeling frustration about the slowness of the response.

Currently, mousetraps distributed by FM lie throughout
the dorm, in rooms and hallways. some students have taped
up holes in their vents to try to stop the mice from getting into
their room. Students say these countermeasures have had some
effect and fewer mice have been seen, but the problem has still
not gone away.
