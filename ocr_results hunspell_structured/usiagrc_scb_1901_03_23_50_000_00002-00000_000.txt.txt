HE W, I. A. A. A. has passed
through a trying crisis.
trorn which itrs just now emerging.
The Big Nine has withdrawn from
the Association and will hold a
meet of its own, while the smaller
institutions will preserve the old
association and continue the an-
nual spring meets. This move
was undoubtedly the one for the
smaller institutions to make. The
material advantage lies in the
equal footing upon which the ath-
letlc teams will stand; tlle meets
are apt to be less one~sided her-e
after, The moral advantage comes
from the attitude the smaller- in
stitutions take in deiying the are
rogance oi the Big Nine; the lat
ter are not at all necessary to the
success of the former. VVllile the
separation and independent or-
ganizations alluded to are not yet
established facts, all indications
point to such being the case in a

very short time.

With one exception these are,

The necessity of declaring off the
dual meet with Iowa resulted in a
serious disturbance of track inter
ests. The vacant date. May it,
had to be ﬁlled, and a triangular
rneei has ﬁnally been arranged.
The meet is to be held at Ames,
and teams representing 1. S. C.r
Drakeallthrinnellaretoconipete.
This is something of an innovation
in Iowa athletics and is already
attracting considerable attention.
The teams will be evenly matched
and it is safe to ptedict that the
meet will be very clase,

This arrangement will really
leave the outcome of the state
meet more doubtful than ever.
The comparative strength of S. U.
I. and Gl‘mnell has been hereto-
toro largely determined by the
dual meet. Theprobableshowing
of Ames, Drake and Grinnell at
the state meet, however, will not
be determined by this triangular
meet, because of the fact that S.
U. I. is to be such an important
factor in the former.

Johns Hopkins is at present
without a president, owing to the
resignation ot President Gilman
after twenty-ﬁve years of faithful
service. Asyet it isimpossible to
say who willbe President Gilnlan's
