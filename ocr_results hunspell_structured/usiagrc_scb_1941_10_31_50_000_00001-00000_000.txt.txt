Fall” is much more than a mere
mystery-thriller.

Dan, a pageboy from a nearby
resort hutel, Who is portrayed by
James Gardner, is a character
that will provide a real sheep—
counting companion during an
amnesia attack.

The play presents a seemingly
true picture of a twisted person—
ality, an ego which is cannibalis-
tic, and which eventually turns
upon itself in self—destruction.

The scene is placed in a remote
forest near Essex, England, in
