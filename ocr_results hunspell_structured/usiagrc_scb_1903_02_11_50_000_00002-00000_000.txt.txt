OR the ﬁrst time since 1900
g Glinncll will have areples
sentative in the State Oratottcal
contest which is to occur at Oskas
loosa on February 27, Our orator
deserves the united support otthe
college and a delegation of Crin-
ncll students should attend the
contest. A football game at
CskalooSa would draw a largc
crowd and there is every reason
that a goodly number of Grinncll
Supportet'sshould otter thcccllcgc
orator the inspiration of their
presence at the state contest. We
want to win the contest thi year
itwc can and next year it not
this. and the tray to win is to pres
pate to nrnnse the interest that
insures hard work on oration; for
preliminary contests and for the
ﬁnal contest with other schools.
Only loyal support ot oratory
this year will encourage oratory
in the future.
