Mr. E, D. Strong is Grlnnell’s rel»
resentatll‘c at tile Qliadrangnlar De-
bating League conference being held
at Waterloo today. Faculty represen-
tatives hour each of the other three
schools, Carleton, Beloit, and Knox,
are also present in Conference.

Having found that it was impossible
to settle the questions which caused
the break in debate relations last
spring, the [our Schools decided to
meet on neutral territory and go over
the matter thoroughly. As Waterloo
is almost equi-distant from all of the
four colleges, it was chosen as the
Scene of the meeting.

if the four colleges can reach a sat-
isiactory agreement fur Conducting
this year‘s debates the leaguc will be
continued, and the dates of the Cour
tests, the question, and the other de-
tails Will he settled before the confer-v
once is ended. If no agreement can
he reached it is probable that the
league will be considered broken. In
this case it is possible that Grinnell
vrill arrange a dual debate with one or
the colleges involved, or a triangle ale
fair with two of thorn.

Grinnell still holds firm to the orig
inal contention of last spring, that
scouting is dishonorable and can not
be permitted iii intercollegiate debat-
ing. Adv-ices from Beloit indicate-that
that school holds the same position as
Grinnell. It is not definitely known
what stand Carleton and Knox ill
take on the matter, but their po on
as indicated by their reprcsolitat'bes
at Waterloo today will probably dc»
ternrine whether or not the quadrangu-
lar league is to continue.

N0 Question Frnnl lit‘luit Yet.
Carleton and KnoV have already sub—
niittcd a choice for thi, ar's debate
question, iii accordance with the quad-
rangular compact, which is still Cour
sidei-ed iii force. Grinnell has also
submitted it question to the‘ three col-
leges. Beloit has not yet taken any
action on the mattcn
The compact cntcred iirto nith the
three schools last year was of three
year's duration, arid the cancellation
of thc donates last spring (1005 not
necessarily mean the breaking of the
league, Giiniiell, Carleton nnd Knox
have preferred to take the positron
that the compact is still in force, and
Beloit‘s attitude wrll he learned at to-
day's conference. Of course, if no
agreement can be reached on the inat-
tcr of scouting the league will be do-
clarcd broken, officially, at the Wat~
erloo eontcrcnce.
Cat: and Cornell Are Wailing.
Tentative arrangements have dlrca-
dy been made with Coc and Cornell to
continue debating with thcse colleges
as last year, No dciinltc arrange
ments can be made until altcr the talc
of the quadrangular league has been
determined, but it is probable that in
any case Grinncll will debate Cornell
and Coc. The time or these debates
wrll probably be earlier than last yeztr,
perhaps tlic last of February. Debates
with the colleges or the Qllatlraiigular
league would be scheduled for the last
of March. according to the present cone
tract
The negative team will debate on
