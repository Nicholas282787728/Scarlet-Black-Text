Scotland has more to offer than just sheep

Beer, Rugby part of a package deal

by Jenny Phibhs

For those inclined towards mixing
alcohol and academics, the overseas study
program at Stirling University in Scotland
should have special appeal. Jon Maron
spent last semester studying (and drink-
ing) at this small university of approx-
imately 4,000 students.

Never belittling the academic rigor at
Stirling, which Jon found “comparable to
Grinnell," he was, nevertheless, intrigued
by the fashion with which th Scottish
choose to imbibe their liquor,

Located at the foot of the Scottish
Highlands between Glasgow and the
capitol ot Edinburgh, Stirling University is
one of the newer British institutions of
higher learning. March, a general science
major, studied anthropology, physics and
biochemistry.

Although the university's science
department is of high repute, Jon found
that many of the approximately 35 other
American students studying at Stirling
were there for its socal studies program.
‘.‘I met English, history and political
science majors. All the departments were
good."

Each class met four times a week, coma
prising a total or diree lectures periods and
one seminar group study. No questions
were allowed during the lectures, and the
accessibility of the. teachers proved

nowhere near Grinnell's generally open
policy.

But, of course, Maron experienced more
than simply the challenge of Scottish
academic life. “The value of the program
came from the ease with which you could
get into the culture. You have to gel involv-
ed. The people made the difference. There
is not that feeling of seclusion one might
experience from, ior instance, the
Grinnell-in-London program.”

Maron believed the British students
were less imagesconscious than American
students. The feeling of superficiality pro-
ved to be less prevalent. As for the
materialsim Americans are so often cons
demed for, the Erittish appeared less in-
clined towards this apparent malady. That

is, if possession of a good sound system in- .

dicates reckless materialism.

Another interesting difference is the way
in which the Scottish fund their univers
sities. The government grants financial
assistance to every British student.
Although the amount oi money granted
varies with parental income, it does cover
the entire cost of tuition. The numerous
clubs on campus are largely funded by the
university. Whether one desires to hang
glide, parachute or just sit carefully and
discuss philosophical ideas, the experience
would not tax your wallet.

Five Steps in Time

by Paula Nixon

The clock in Big Ben lower strikes three
as she approaches Poet's Corner in
Westmlnister Abbey. The tolling seems
unusually loud; this was the closest she'd
been to Big Ben since her arrival in Lon-
don. Plaques memorialize dozens of poets
in the Poet's Corner, but she walks up to a
particular one. She recognizes Oct. 25,
the supposed anniversary of the death or
Geoffrey Chaucer, by placing bright
daisies on his heavy gravestone

She speaks softly, “Hi. I wish you could
see what we’re doing ivith your Canter-
bury Tales." At her right a tour guide
assembles a group nearby. She muses at
her own silliness as she turns on her heel to
leave the Abbey

Outside, the setting sun surprises her
eyes. She strolls past the gift shop, turns
right and heads toward the tube shop. No
one could tell by her quick pace that she
was almost late for an appointment,
because everyone walks swiftly in the mid
day at Whitehall. The “Circle Line” train
pulls up as she is buying a ticket. She runs
downstairs, through a tunnel of people
and jumps onto the train just before the
doors close. A clear partition supports her
while she looks around for an empty Seat.
There are none, she glances up at the ads.
A clever vandal had altered a sign above
the train doors so that it now told
passengers to “obstruct the doors, cause
delay and be dangerous." instead or warn-
ing that, “obstructing the doors causes
delay and may be dangerous,” Clever van—
dalism makes her smile. when the doors
open at the next stop, she shivers at the
chill they let in.

It is still colder when she emerges from
a throng of commuters in Covent Garden.
She pulls from her pocket an “A to Z"
guidebook to establish her hearings, She
greets her companion on Longacre,

“What did you do last night?” she asked
him.

“You wouldn‘t believe it!" he exclaims.
“We went pub-crawling. After the pubs
closed, we walked to Buckingham Palace.
You know the Memorial to Queen Victoria
showing Truth, Constancy, Victory and all
that stuff? Well, we climbed up and kissed
Vicky!- it was hysterical! What did you

“We danced at the Oddiellow Arms' SiX'
ties Night. it was pretty crowded, You
know, their conception of the '605 is much
different than ours. Americans stuck out
like sore thumbs. 0h, especially one group
from Notre Dame, They started singing
their school fight song, and l was so em-
barrassed to be an Americanl It made me
want to crawl under a rug. Other than that,
it was a good evening."

”That's good What do you want to see
tonight?”

“How about Evita?"

. “Sounds good, Hey 7 it's about five
o'clock 7 shall we go to Leicester Square
for tickets?”

“Sure," she says.

They walk west, five times in step With
the tolling of Big Ben.

 

For diversion at Stirling, Maron could
not resist the temptation oiiered by the six
campus pubs. As a member of the athletic
crowd, he tended to stalk the sports
pavilion pub. Scottish beer served warm
seemed ﬁle perfect reward after an ex-
haustirlg workout.

While at the univestity, rugby became
Maron‘s new athletic pursuit. This sport is
one of the most popular in Scotland%ven
the sheep like it, and as they comprise the
majority in Scottish society, one should not
smugly discard their opinion. The rich,
green grassland oi Scotland is sheared
down to rugbysplaying proportion by those
sheep,

A Scottish rugby match is not without its
unique ritual. Each player must pay a
match feem70 pence or approximately $1,
and this money enters the pub fund. After
the match, conquerors, conquered and
even the referees head off together to the
nearest pub to drink that warm beer and
exhange anecdotes oi their past moments
of glory.

There is a new perspective to be gal .
outside of a small town in Iowa. .lon Maron
seems to have found it in Stirling,
Scotland. “Overall the experience was
very worthwhile. I would recommend it to
anyone," he said. At the very least one
could get used to the taste of warm beer.

Chinese experience
offers new perspective

by Ellen l-leaih

Bethe Keegan has returned from a
semester in China with an entirely new
perspective on that country: a respect for
its culture and the benefits of communism
there. Keegan said her term in China,
sponsored by the Council on lnternational
Educational Exchange, was "a personal
experience” which challenged all the
values she had previously held.

Along with 16 other students from
around the United States, Keegan attended
classes at Nanjing University, about zoo
miles west of Shanghai Almost all of the
classes were taught in Chinese, and lec-
tures were two to three hours long.
Associate Professor of History Andrew
Hsieh was the resident director of the pro-
gram and taught a course on contemv
porary state and society in China. Before
going to China, Keegan had attended an in
tensive language program at the Universi»
ty oi Washington tor nine weeks.

Keegan said one of her most “shocking"
experiences was when she flew into Nanjs
ing. The city had the look of a 19403 war
town, she said. Bicycles and army trucks
were used for transportation, and there
was construction everywhere, Her initial
impression was that it was a city oi
“organized confusion."

All of the students in the program lived
in a foreign students' dormitory. There
were two Americans and one Chinese stu-
dent to each room, which, Keegan said, is
a rare occurrence in China, where the
native students are not usually allowed 00
room with foreigners. Keegan became
close friends with her roommate who coins
ed a nickname for her. In Chinese,
Keegan’s name is Ji Hengsbai, which
means “eternally virtuous,” but her rooms
mate called her Ji heng»hong, translating
“eternally red.“

Keegan explained that she thinks most
westerners have misconceptions about
Chinese communism. She feels the

Chinese have communism to thank for a .

rising standard of living and added, “We
don’t know how bad it was there beiore
communism... and Chinese communism is
very difierent from Soviet communism,"
She also argued, “There is no way to con
ceive what it's like there unless you've
been there. The low standard or living in
Nanjing often depressed the American

students and forced them to rethink their
own values."

During their free time the students
bicycled, visited parks and went shopping.
Keegan said shopping was a good way to
get to know Chinese people, Stores there
are not simply places to make purchases
but meeting places where local people
pass the time, The students were “spec
tacles” Keegan said and were constantly
bombarded by Chinese asking them ques-
tions. They were delighted that the
students could speak Chinese.

Most of the American students stayed in
China after the semester, but Keegan was
force to leave early because of an appen—
dicitis attack. She was operated on in a
Chinese workers' hospital, and later spent
two more weeks in a hospital in Hong Kong
before returning home. While in China she
also learned about and experienced
acupuncture,

In spite of her health problems there,
Keegan said she enjoyed the semester and
made some good friends. She added, “1
know thatl'll goback.”
