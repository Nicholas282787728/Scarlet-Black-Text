i What the Clubs

Busill 5 Club

Rudolph i\'eitz,,'21, of the engineer
Ins and contracting firm of Charles
Weitz and Sons, Des M‘olnes, adresscd
the Business club at its last weekly
meeting in the clubl-oom of Dibble
hall. Ill his talk on "Graduate Bllsls
liess Schools," he attempted to bring
out the theory and principle of these
schools as compared to the theory of
actual practice. Himself it graduate
of the Harvard School of Business Ad~
ministration he was able to suit-
stantiate his statement concerning
business theory and the actual prac-
tice of it. Although Mr \Veitz stated
that a post graduate business course
was not absolutely necessary as in
the case of the scientific arts, he said
that it was of great help in advance
lnent in the business world.

Sctenm Chill

“Lemons and Geraniums“ was the
unusual title of the address given by
I F. Lcwi now Professor of Chenn
istry at’Col-nell University. Ho dis-
cusscd the “dizzy mathematics" of
modern Chemistry and gave some as-
tounding facts about the slight dilier-
ence in the arrangement of atoms
which results in two entirely different
substances. Mr, Lewis is well known
in the commercial field of chemistry
and was able to give an interesting
and authoritative talk to the club.
