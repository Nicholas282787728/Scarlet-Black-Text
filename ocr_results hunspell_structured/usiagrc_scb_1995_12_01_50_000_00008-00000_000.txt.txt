World AIDS Day
To the Editor:

World AIDS Day is not only a
day to raise levels of awareness and
education, butalso to reﬂect on those
whose lives have been irrevocably
affected by HIV and AIDS. This
does not ju5( include persons with
HIV/AIDS and their families and
friends. With AIDS as the leading
cause of death for men and women
ages 25-44. we believe that HIV af—
fects everyone.

Fortunately, AIDS is now pte»
Ventable, Abstinence is riie only
100% effective method, but safer sex
is also critically important. Butwhar
every sexually active person must
remember is that safer sex is more
than consistent and correct condom
use—it involves responsibility, edu«
cation, and knowledgeable decision
making,

Please join GEAR in observing
World AIDS Day—wear a ribbon,
readandrememberstatistics,takean
information sheet, But please also
remember those same facts on De«
cember 2nd, 3rd, and 4th...\Vl[l1 no
cure in sigiir for AIDS, it is up to
every individual to prevent the spread
otrliis epidemic.

Use to Kill Flies
To the Editor:

I've been studying abroad and
recently got my first two some in
the mail. It felt like I was there on
campus as I scanned the inane news,
perused all the whiny letters to the
editor and caught up on all the losing
sports teams. It was a breath of fresh
air,

IfI closed my eyes and concen«
trated, I could see the bleary walls of
ARH inspiring many a critical
thought and smell the mud tracked
across the post office making the
stepsadeathtrap. Oh 5&5, it‘s amaz—
ing how your dead trees and ink can
bring back the memories. A meta—
phorical tear came to my eye as I
remembered the days when I too
could stand in a line to eat and have
my eyes spontaneously diverge after
sitting in front of a computer screen
for just a little too long. I actually
wept with Joy when I remembered
that inafew short months I'll be back
among the iiappy rlirong as we sltip
through the slush to class. My heart
sang with glee at the thought of all
the scandals clue to erupt on campus
nextsemesterspurring the numberof
whiny letters to the editor.

Of course, I’m joking about the
5&B; every news article is pungent,
each letter to the editor profound
and all our sports teams do nothing
but Win (it contains a plethora of
coherent cartoons, too). Thanks to
whoever had the brilliance to send
the 5&8 to those of us studying
abroad; not only does it keep me
connected to all the action—packed,

meaningful events on campus, btit it
also gives me something I can use to
kill ﬂies. Have a nice day,

The Space Issue
To the Editor:

We, the members of Concerned
Black students, are responding to
the callforSPACE that othergroups
representing students of color have
been fighting for the post (we to six
years. We support ASIA, SOL and
ISO in their struggle for cultural
SPACE, We believe that these
groups are entitled to a SPACE that
they can call their own.

Itis ourexperience that cultural
SPACE benefits not only the stu—
dents of color, but also the entire
campus community, and the town as
well. This SPACE would allow the
students of color to preserve their
culture \Vithout judgment from the
entire campus community, in which
everyone can learn about the culture
for which the SPACE was designat—
ed

We believe that the college does
not feel that SPACE is a priority on
this campus. This is a pressing issue
which has been tabletl for the past
five years. ASIA,SOLandISOhave
patiently waited for SPACE wliilt
they have been repeatedly told that
Grinnell College does not have ade<
quatefiindingiorintlividualSPACE.
The Bowen i-Iall ofScience and the

Fine Arts building received funding
before the SPACE issue was side.

quately resolved. What kind of mes«
sage do you riiinlr [his sends to the
students of color whohave beenstrug
gling With the issue ofSPACE for the
last five years? It isan issue ofpriority
and points to the contradiction be—
tween the college’s written policy
and actual practices.

We understand the Trustee 's
Smndpomt that SPACE would pro.
mote segregation, However, we be»
lieve segregation on this campus
wouldbe impossible toachieve. This
idea assumes that we have the ability
to separate ourselves as students of
color, inapredominanrlywliite town,
on a predominantly white campus.
At a large university, this may be
feasible, but in Grinnell,segregarion
is simply impossible. This line of
thinking also assumes that we would
be Willing to withdraw from all cam—
pus activities. We feel that we have
a lot to offer the campus community.
What would happen if every cultural
group on campus decided not tohave
any activities for an entire yeatl The
campus would then realize how ctUr
cial we are to the College.

It has been suggested that these
groups pusli for a third floor to rlie
Forum or try orheralternatives. The
official position of CBS is that we
will support ASIA, SOL and ISO in
whatever they feel would be the best
for them, whether it is in the form of
individual SPACE, an addition to
the Forum, or any other form that

willsatisfytheirneeds Weknowthe
importance of housing and we feel
that it is a detriment to the entire
community to deny housing to these
groups.

Some would argue that thnnell
College is doing more than other
colleges and universities when it
comes to addressing the needs ofstu-
dents ofcolor and that we should be
happy. Does this mean that just
because we might be ”better" than
some other colleges that we should
stop trying! Since when has doing
Just enough become the standard of
excellence at Grinnelll

“Gentlemen of Grinnell"
Dear “Gentlemen of Grinnell”:

Earlier this week, the Sexual
Assault Awareness Group, of iihicli
I am o member, bung signs in the
dorms and loggias advocating safe,
consensual sex, specifically wirli tlie
intention of decreasing the number
of sexual assaults ivliieli, according
to the Office of Student Affairs, oc—
cur after Walt-t. A day or two later,
anunltnowngroupormenliungsigns
next to ours which read, “GENTLE—
MEN OF URINNELL'!l BE VERY
CAUTIOUS. Apparently. this year
at Waltz, women are not responsible
forthemselves, whereas men, on the
other hand, are responsible for both
their actions and the actions of any
female they may be with."

ness Group posters. First of all, our
signswere notdireeredspeeiiieally to
women, but to all members of the
Grinnell community. For this very
reason, the majority ofthe signs were
writtenwrthgenderneutrallanguage.
Those signs which were addressed to
womenonly reﬂect the fact that most
sexual assaults are perpetrated by men
upon women. Second, we were not
trying to tell people that they are not
responsible for their actions, but
merely that they should not blame
themselves ifthey are assaulted, and
should not hesitate to file charges
merely because they were drunk or
dressed “provocatively" or for any
other reasonibecnuse nothing is an
excuse for sexual assault. While
women and men must be responsible
for their own actions, the victim is
never responsible for sexual assault.

In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUETTNER

I walk by the Forum about four
times daily, back and forth to the
drab wonder that is ARH for two
hoursofclasses. Without fail, inthe
parking lot for Student Affairs I see a
little blaelt Honda sports car parked
illegally, either directly on top ofthe
phtase “NO PARKING,” outlined
inbrightyellow,orimmediatelynext
to the bright yellow curb. I'm not
sure what that phrase and that color
meanto most ofyou, but Iknow what
rbey mean to me, 'niey- mean, well,
no parking.

Yet that little black Honda has
never been towed, or even—as far as
I have seenihad so much as a park—
ing ticket decorating its blunt hood.
Curious to see ifGrinnell College is
as lenient towards students as it is
towartlthe DirectorofHousingwhen
ir eomes to parking, I devised an
experiment.

I took my rusty red station wag.

hours later, I received a little yellow
bill from Grinnell fot $57this in
addition to the $25 they wanted for
theprivilege ofhuntingforaspotout
byQuad,andthe$ZI,410theywanrt
ed for the privilege of slowly losing
my mind The bill also informed me
that subsequent infractions would
incur more dire consequences, such
as immobilization, VisionsofNancy
Kerrigan danced in my head~did
they mean immobilizationofthe sta<
tion wagon, orofme? Ineithercase,
I wasn't going to take a chance. I
quickly removed my ear to a less
offensive spot.

Despite my little experiment, I
still don't know to what degree the
Orinnell is serious about its parking
policies. I know that I owe Grinnell
College $5. i know that no one has
yet shown up at my door with a
baseball bat. I also know that the
little black Honda is not listed in the
Campus Memo as being next on the
[OW truck driver's list—in fact, it is
not listed at all, which leads me to
believe that, by some trust of fate,
the Directoroil-lousingprobablydoes
not owe Grinnell College 555.
