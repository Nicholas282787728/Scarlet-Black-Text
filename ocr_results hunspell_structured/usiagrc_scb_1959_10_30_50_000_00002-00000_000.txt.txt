Tuition — A Look At Both Sides ‘

The letter concerning the tui oil raise in the ad_' iliing
column certainly deserves an editorial comment. Some of
the points presented are Valid and some are definitely un»
true.

First, the tllitioll raisc was abrupt. The unexpected
announcement declaring the increase may be, ill the eyes
of the administration and the trustees, the proper Way to
let the action be known, but it cannot help bllt be distastes
ill] to the student members of the Grinnell community.

A more specific statement of why this had to be
done would have been ill order, we believe. with the coopera-
tion ol' the administration, the Scarlet and Black will:
attempt to give a comprehensive treatment of the college’s!
finances in a future issue, and more Specifics on the tllitionl
raise. We believe that a complete ills fication is behind‘
this move and that students will recognize l . i

We beg to differ llith the write a Second statement
til-lt an understanding that there would not be another
ml . until the nlajOlity of the student body had graduated
existed a year ac‘o. in rereading the president's letter of
last year, we find no such gualantce to the students.

However, other students we have spoken with contend
that a definite statement was made by the adlni istration
at the mass meeting; held laSt year, when the question of
subsequent tuition increases was brought up. If any p'llal'-‘
alitee was made this would be where it arose. i

We are ill agreement with the writers position ill re-
"“‘ti to freshmen scholarship students. There are students
hire on a subsistence budget and it is a moral obligation,
of the administration to see that this raise docs not become
Nt‘ic hair that broke the camel’s back" to these students. ‘

We do not believe that there are luxuries on the campus
who' total ll ortll anywhere near approaches that the ad-
stratitm will receive from this increase. The $100,000,
s figure is necessary to decrease the deficit spending
ti has been brought oil the college the last few years. i
As distasteful as the tuition increase may seem to,
some, other colleges have found the situation men more
troublesome.

plt
l‘;

Carlton college is now in the process of raising its ttlis‘
l'oll $200 every year. Knox college’s tuition has been high-
er than Grinuell’s the last few years also. Gifts to the col-
' ', do not rise to the same extent that the cost of living:
does and when all else fails, the burden must he borne by
the students. ‘

must repay the school. lt is con.
ceivable that no matter how
‘iibcral the support, a student or
this tamlly might not be able to
‘aft'ord either to stay or to leave.
We understand that a school
needs money ior salaries and
iacilities, and that inilation is
affecting many areas oi our
econom however, we condemn
the timing of this action and
tool that there were dishonor-
able intentions involved.
Perhaps'many students would
be willing to relinquish some
oi the present luxuries provide
ed here in order to retain the
educational standards of the
school at the present cost.

Gillett. who spoke on the Birth

spunsc to Senator Gillett's pr -

sontatlon was a mixed one, and

seemed to consist oi both an
emotional and Em intallt‘clllzli
reaction

Emotionally, most would agree
that Senator Gillett was a most
ellgaalng and charming person.
aliti, his vitality and enthusiasm
arc bctollllng and unusual to a
man or his yea

Intellectually, the response
to the content (if his iuioruiat
talk was in part one oi dis-
appointment. The opinion was
voiced that the Senator’s pro.
posal in regard to the thorny
prublenl oi the veto power
was an unintelligent one.
wholly inconsistent with the
icon cs oi the world power
situation and the purpose or
a “world" organization.
Senator Gillett had simply
tossed this out as a suggestion
[or one possible approach, with
no implication that he was
stumping the country tor the
conversion oi the UN. into an
expanded NATO.
