this year, they can enter the competition a
much-improved team. The women‘s
sqilad, traditionally strong, will also travel
to Chicago (or the meet on Friday and
Saturday as one of the teams to beat.

slip-ups that decide this meet.” .

“Nothing is definite about conference,"
exclaimed women's Coach Evelyn
Freeman. “I expect to field a very strong,
solid team. but we're running against
some pretty tough schools.

Freeman noted, however. the progress

the year, I was afraid of being weak in a

Men’s Swimming
Conference Meet

by Paula Rue

The biggest meet of the 1986-87 season
lies ahead of the Grinnell‘s Men's Swim
Team. in hosting the conierence meet
March 5 through 7, the Pioneers hope to
shatter last year's record-breaking score
and will also attempt to garner their ninthr
consecutive conference title. Coach Ray
Obermiller expects the competition to be
tough. and expects Grinnell's main adver-
saries to be Lake Forest and, possibly, the
University oi Chicago. Says Obermiller,
“We’re coming ready to swrm, as are the
other teams. We hope to get some ol our
best times in this meet, and possibly set
some new conference records. It will be a
barnrburner oi a meet." in keeping with
the team’s mottos, “loose llps sink ships"
and “It’s not over 'til the fat lady Sings,"
team member Paul Froese promised,

“We’ll try," while [ellow teammate Joe
Lewis commented, “We’ll see whatwe can
do.”

The pioneers should be strong in all oi
the events, and Obermiller feels that many
or the swimmers will get their best. times
oi the year at this meet. The main competi-
tion should be between Grinnell and Lake
Forest. “They're coming back with all oi
their swimmers irom last year, but it will
be close," said Obermiller. Some of the
Pioneers are also in contention ior
Natlonal»qualilying spots, according to
Obermiller. Right now, the 40d and
ﬂoﬂrl’ree relay teams, Tim Laughinghouse
iii the butterrly, rim Brouillette in diving,
and Bob WandJing in the lreestyie events
all have excellent shots at qualiiying ior
