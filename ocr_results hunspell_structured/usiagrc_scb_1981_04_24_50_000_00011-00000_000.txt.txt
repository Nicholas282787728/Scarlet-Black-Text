Above Suspicion
Sat., 9pm., ARH; Sun, 7:30pm., ARH

In the style of such well-known
suspense classics as Costa-Gavras’ Z
and The Confession, this highly ac-
claimed thriller focuses on the story of
a brilliant, homicidal police captain
who murders his girlfriend and then
proceeds to leave telltale clues in the
hope that he will be apprehended by his
fellow officers. The New York Daily
News solemnly declares that the film
"uncoils with snake-like precision" and
it won an Accademy Award for Best
Foreign Film. If you can drag yourself
away from the nearest Relays keg to
see this one, it will certainly be worth
the Herculean effort. ~ Peter Ruderr

The Kids Are All Right

Fri., 10:45 pm. ARH; Sat., 11 pm,
ARH

if you don‘t like rock music 7 and
Who music in particular — this is not a
picture for you. The Kids Are Alright is
a sort of documentary maole chiefly of
concert film clips tied loosely together
by interviews,

The excellent film footage comes
from various performances including

Wm

the Smothers Brothers television Show
on which Keith Moon's exploding drum
set sent shock waves through the pro-
ducers and the band members in
timidated host Tommy Smothers. Rare
footage from the Rolling Stones' ill»
fated Rock and Roll Circus ta movie
which the Stones set up to glorify
themselves but ended up being stolen
by The Who and Jethro Tull and has
hence never been released in full)
shows The Who in top form.

All in all, the film is an excellent look
at the band which more than any other
has defined the rock genre. It's fast-
paced, lively and funny. The music is
excellent. If you like rock music, don't
miss it. — Dan Flynn

Six Days in Soweto
Fri., 8 p.m., SL; Sun.. 7:30 ptm,, Burl-
ing Viewing Room

The Soweto rebellion that occurred in
June two has proven to be one of the
most important events in modern South
African history. The worldwide fury
caused by these riou reawakened the
consciences of many and enlightened
others who had never really understood
the horror of the apartheid system. Six
Days in Soweto documents the rebellion
through interviews with participants,
news footage and photographs. A

booklet put out by California newsreel
calls the movie "a cinematically stunnr
ing and emotionally powerful film —
not merelya record of rebellion against
the violence of apartheid but an insight
into the daily lives and consciousness of
the people of Soweto3> Joel Robbins,

This merry Marx Brothers‘ romp'
kicks off the Relays' night of fun frivollr
ty at the movies Despite not having
viewed the film myself, I can, in no
uncertain terms, say I have no in
trospective position whatsoever on this
film However, other reviewers have
been less than kind. Plot, for instance,

,allegedly saw little of the script. The

pretext of the story has our boys living
it up high while attempting to locate a
hacker to spring their act into the big
time My favorite source, Hollowny's
Guide. describes Room Service as, a
“Claustrophobic Broadway farce" with
the Marx Brothers playing “characters
with a passing resemblance to human
beings " A different light is shed on the
film by the mysterious reviewer
M.F.B., “It should also be noted , , . that
there is a scene in which a turkey is
chased around a room, Not everybody
will care for thls." 7G. Robert
