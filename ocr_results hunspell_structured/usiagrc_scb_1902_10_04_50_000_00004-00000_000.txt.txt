DEDICATION OF THE CHAPEL
ORGAN.

Notwithstanding several reports
to the contrary, the rierv organ in
Alumni Hall willbe opened for
the ﬁrst time publicly tomor'ow
afternoon at the Vesper service.
It has been decided that the (res
coing and other repairs to the
chapel room, lot which it was
thought the dedication would
have to be delayed, shall wait till
the holidays. Tire organ presents
a very neat appearance and is
said to have an exceptionally ﬁne
tone. The organ arrived from
Chicago two weeks ago, and its
erection. under the supervision of
Mr, Jesse E. Smith, Lyon and
Healy'sinostslrilledorganbuilder,
has proceeded without the least
delay. Great interest has been
taken in this instrument by the
manufacturers, from Mr. Ernst
Schmidt, the manager of the organ
department,and Mr.R.].Bennett.
the superintendent of the factory.
down to all the various craftsmen
who have been engaged on it tor
the last three months, and noth-
ing has been spared which would
make the organ as nearly perfect
as it is possible tor an organ to be.

The music at vespers tomorrow
will be as follows:
