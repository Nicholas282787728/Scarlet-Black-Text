College-town relations

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to the
front page article of 4-23776,
”Student safety problem
develops." Your reporter, Tom
Pantea, presented a clear picture
ot a growing problem in the
Grinnell community. However, his
use of the label ”townies" is un-
called for and should be retracted
publicly. The primary reason ior
this demand islthat this type oi
labeling can only hurt any efforts
to improve relations between the
college and town communities.
Sure there are drastic differences
between the two communitieS,

some of which will always remain.
However, the efforts of numerous
student groups to interact with the
community outside oi Grinnell
College will be hurt if such labeling
continues. i am speaking. as a
person who has lived both inside
and outside of Grinnell College. If
students don’t have the nerve to
stand up for their rights then I
suggest they never leave their 4 x 8
cubby holes. For, brothers and
sisters, the world outside of
Grinnell College is no easy place
to live in, Marvin C. Barnes,
Former Grinnell College Student,
now “townie"

A fond farewell

To the Editor:

Dianne Ruyffelaere, Robert and
Marilyn Hoskinson, John and
Nancy HickseHershey and Dick
Vos will be leaving the Student
Affairs staff at the end of this year.
I would like to express my personal
thanks to them for the countless
hours they have spent with
students while they have been at
Grinnell, 1 would especially like to
thank Marilyn Hoskinson and

Nancy HicksHershey. As spouses
of Resident Advisers, they have for
all practical purposes been
ResidentAdvisers themselves, and
yet seldom receive any recognition
for the great amount of time and
energy they give the College and
its students.

Thanks for caring and for being
such good people to work wim.

”Take the pizza and run?" Sue
Repp’s column in the last issue of
the $51? featured its always in-
teresting sauce, ﬂavored with so
subtle an ignorance Yes, I must
admit, the 5&8, with its history oi
hastlness and indiscriminate
slander, has little sense, and lacks
much taste or insight. I’m
referring to a statement in the
paragraph on Coe College’s conv
fercnce on Women held April 14 To
quote—”The women there, despite
their makeup and high heels, are
much more politically advanced
than Grinnell women." Sue bases
this decision on one “truly im-
pressive" conference held one day
in April. There is no mention of
how many women attended or
were “politically advanced” by the
day’s ordeal, nor is there any
credit given to those (women and

\men'l) who organized the con-
ference, I dare claim that all effort
(especially political initiative) is
usually the work of a select few,
who are aware oi the necessity ior
such effort. And if the political few
radicalize the apolitical majority,
then who needs “makeup and high
lleels'l" For, after all, shouldn't
onc's political beliefs demand a
more “political" appearance? And
how ovcrcmphasized are political
beliefs anyway?

Politics, yes, may inspire per-
sonal change, and one may assume
a certain political stance because
of one's personal beliefs, but too
many play the hypocrite and
preach a politic without grasping
its practice, A politic dead and
disbelieved is a “politic” who
masks her face and lifts her heels

CURRiculAR CUTS dECRiEd:

DEpARTMENTAl OVERIOAds pREdiCTEd

OPEN SPACE

The Education Department has
improved itseli markedly during
the past three years The depart»
ment now certiiies anywhere
between one to two dozen students
annually. That's the equivalent to
the number of majors in many
other departments. In addition, the
department serves approximately
150 to Us ”non»majors" through its
present course offerings, its
curriculum is designed to provide
consistency between the
philosophies or a liberal arts
cdut'ation and the process oi
teacher certiiication, This growth
in lhe deparlment‘s credibility is
due to the dedicated work oi Beryl
Wellborn, Roberta Atwell and Dick
Van Scatter. Their Contribution to
the college has been rewarded by a
cutback ior the 7737!! academic
year oi one full position in the
education department.

The position cut, it has been
promised, will result in curricular
cuts, a possible shifting oi courses
into other disciplines, and an in-
creased workload for the
remaining stair. There is the
remote possibility oi a halftime
statt person being hired in the
iuture, but no immediate eiiort
has been made or is promised.
What this decision means ior the
students at Grinnell College who
seek to make a social contribution

by teaching, or who wish to un
derstand the conditions of man and
howhe grows in mind and spirit, or
who want to understand the society
through its great unifying in-
stitution, the school, is that they'd
best consider packing their bags
and checking out the alternatives.

In addition to the abrupt halt to
the progressive growth of the
department, 1 can envision the
following consequences of this
damaging decision. First, the
trend toward “liberal artsing” the
education department will be
reversed. The education departr
mentwili probably become strictly
a professional training program
which makes it completely in»
congruous with the philosophy of a
liberal arts program. Does this
mean that we can expect a iuture
decision to remove it all together
because it represents “creeping
professionalism?” That would
certainly be a crime in this school
that has a pre-law, pre-med,
professional-student orientation,

A second consequence of this
decision is that the certification
program will become less suh.
stantive, Certified teachers from
Grinnell will not be exposed to a
curriculum that will help them
develop a strong teaching
philosophy since it's only
reasonable to assume that a two
person department won’t be able to
offer anything but the basic state-
required certification courses.
These students will not have the
benefit of classroom exposure to

the applied philosophies that only a
professor of education can convey
with experiential conviction,
Shilling educational philosophy
courses to other departments
precludes the sharing that only a
staff member who has reﬂected
upon his or her elementary or
secondary teaching experiences
can facilitate.

Curricular cuts will significantly
reduce the number of courses that
a nonrcertification student might
prefer to take in the Education
Department. First, oi course, will
be the virtual elimination of the
Ed Thought and special topics
courses. There simply won’t be the
staff available to offer these
courses even though they have
great value. Secondly, increased
work loads ior the faculty will
reduce the number of independents
that students can take in
education. A third problem that
curricular cuts pose relates to the
promise that some courses will be
shifted to other disciplines, These
options, of course, were not ins
vestigated prior to making the

department cuts. Nevertheless,

speculation leads me to believe
that such shifts would bring the
Psychology and the Sociology
departments into play. As we all
know, these haven't exactly been
two departments oi high repute
and performance around this
campus More specifically,
transferring educational
development courses into the
Psychology department would also

mean a significant reduction of
humanistic psychology offerings in
the overall curriculum. Scheduling
of Education courses into the new
Sociology department was not in
the planning for the new program
and we’ll not know the ole
iectiveness oi this department for
a few years to come. Besides being
risky, dumping Education into
Sociology (or any other depart-
ment for mat matter) doesn’t elude
the problem oi curriculum
overload which faces the
Education department. Assuming
that we’re getting a full Sociology
department, as promised, adding
courses to one iull department
irom another departmentis simply
moving the problemeit's not a
solution. Finally, in regard to
shifting courses from Education to
any other department, as l alluded
to earlier, the protessional ex-
pertise that would be available if
education courses were taught
within the framework of its
specific relationships to schooling
would be lost.

As usual this entire decision was
made without student consultation
or notification Once again the
students were informed of a
decision ex post facto. Once again,
only partial iniormation has been
provided; and that's only been
after students took the initiative to
probe the situation. Once again,
the students are left deprived as
the dollar interests win out again.
What a rough way to get a prac-
tical education.
