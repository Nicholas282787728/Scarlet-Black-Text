SGA senators can do
more to keep us posted

A Student Government Association senator’s communication with
his or her constituents should not end after he or she is elected. Too
often, students are not informed about issues that may potentially
affect their lives at Grinnell.

To remedy this situation, the Scarlet and Black encourages current
and future Joint Board senators to make an effort to keep their
constituents informed.

This effort must extend beyond simply posting Joint Board
minutes once a week. It should include printing a weekly agenda on
dorm entrances by Tuesday night, which would leave senators with a
full day to receive input about upcoming issues before they must vote
on them. Senators should also attempt to initiate a dialogue with
their constituents, instead of relying on constituents to bring up
problems or questions themselves. This dialogue should be conducted
on a weekly basis and with a variety of students in order to receive a
wide range of current input

To make an informed dialogue possible, it is necessary for the
SGA administrative coordinator to make the weekly agendas as
complete as possible. If any matter is not fully detailed in the agenda
and it may be construed as controversial, senators, whenever possible,
should table the item until it has been the subject of further discussion
between the senators and constituents.

When any issue of particular importance is scheduled for SGA
deliberation, the senator should call for an open meeting with his or
her constituents. The senator is responsible for represctlting these
constituents, and on any issue with any potential for important,
lasting repercussions, he or she must be aware of the prevailing
majority and minority opinions before voting.

The Scarlet and Black does not claim that the senator is the only
person responsible for creating an effective representative government.
Students must also carry some of the responsibility for keeping
themselves informed. Students sllould encourage the adoption ofthese
recommendations by their senators, and, if they are accepted, there
should be no excuse for being unaware of major issues passing
through Joint Board. All Joint Board meetings are open to students,
and while only senators may volc. any student tnuy discuss an agenda
topic or may bring up new business.

Readers feel that Chai's
analysis overlooked racism

To the Editor:

“Every important social
problem—crime, mental illness,
civil disorder, unemployment—r
has been analyzed within the
framework of the victim-blaming
ideology . . . " says William Ray
in his paper, ”The Art of Savage
Discovery: Blaming the Victim."
The victims of the recent surge of
racial tensions in China are in
fact the African students acquirm g
knowledge in that country. The
immediate source of the street
demonstrations with racist
slogans, or the beatings and
stonings that occurred points to
the fact that a Chinese girlfriend
of an African student refused to
show her ID. at the door to a
party.

As expected from a case such
as this, speculators and theorists
did not waste time before
exploiting this opportunity.
Such leading newspapers as the
Wall Street Journal and New
York Times have published
various articles that attempted to
explain the ‘rcal reasons' behind
the racial tensions in China. In
most cases, they pointed out the
fact that the Chinese government
is already doing too much for
foreigners. especially the African
students who are considered
inferior beings, anyway (so what
else is new) and should not be
beneficiaries of scholarships and
other ‘special favors' from the
Chinese government.

The newest theory was
developed by the famous writer,
MairLce Chai of Grinncll
College. Ms. Chai agrees
evidently that in China,
“traditionally, dark skin is equated

with peasants who work out in
the sun and is looked upon as a
sign of low cultural level." (I
wonder why Iowa farmers remain
for the most part while.) But
additionally, Ms. Chai assesses
that other “cultural differences"
accounted for the resentment for
African students in China. The
most prominent of those cultural
differences, as is pointed out in
Chai's article: “Tales from the
Middle Kingdom.” (Feb. 3, 1989)
is the sexual evenness of the
male Africans.

According to Chai, “the male
African students place a more
overt emphasis on sex Lhan the
Chinese . . . " Further, she adds
that the African students in
China, the majority of whom are
males. stay in China for four to
six years without returning
home, and “as a result, most of
the African students . , were
very aggressive sexually.‘ Why
should the victims always be
blamed? Why is it that certain
people, albeit intentionally, fail
to establish the real cause of a
particular event, but rather mix
up causes and consequences? We
have heard senseless comments
about the Third World, such as,
“The Third World countries
remain underdeveloped because
they are poor." Or vice versa. A
similar case is occurring here
where the vtctims are being
blamed for their misfortunes.

It may be true that the
Africans in China are attracted to
Chinese women; after all, they
arc normal people and living in
China at the moment, and we
don‘t expect them to date

Vietnamese women! But docs
the relationship between the
African males and the Chinese
females constitute the cause of
the racial tensions, or is it ju a
spark that ignited a fire amidst
the racist feelings in China? Are
the Chinese angry because their
women are dating simply
foreigners, or rather because the
women are dating black
foreigners? What is the reaction
of the Chinese vis-a-vis romantic
relationships between Western
students and Chinese women?
Obviously. the Western males
must be dating Chinese women
as well, but there's no fuss made
about it. Maybe it is because the
Westemer is considered culturally
superior in China.

In all, Ms. Chai should
differentiate between cause and
correlation and consequence and
not try to blend them together.
The Chinese people who
constituted the mob in the strceB
were angry not because the male
Africans “place more overt cm-
phasis on sex . r . " (a rather
racist and sexist statement), they
are angry because they simply
cannot stand dark-skinned people.
Granted, the immediate source of
the recent clashes may have
stemmed from relationships
between African males and
Chinese females, but African-
male-Chincse-femalcrdating is
“frowned upon” because the
males are African, therefore by
transitivity, the real reason
behind those clashes is racism.
