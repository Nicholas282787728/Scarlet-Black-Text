fails, only to believe that he has suc—
ceeded. Frank Beetle was an amuse
ing lieutenant while Don Kapp made
an effective Irish policeman. Abe
Rosenhloom was a hilarious burn and
Wynona Ewoldt and Lavinnia Lill-
roth handled the parts of “lost wom—
en” well.

Ties Distinguish

The impression tic scene for this
play designed .hy Martha Page
Hippee, won comment throughout the
laudience.
The third play of the evening, “As
It Was in the Beginning," by Mr.
Irwin, is expressionistic in the ex-
treme, and proved a comedy worth
seeing. The cast included a number
of identical machine-like characters,
speaking in rhyme, and boasting their
individuality. It develops that they
are so alike that the two leading men,
James Clarke and George Guyan, can
be distinguished only by their ties,
while the odd man, Dwight Smiley,
who really is different, is only
spurned.

Expressionistic Music
Others in the cast included Faith
Someis, Joy Rinaldo. Dorothy hit.
Roberta stanbery, Margaret Rabe,
and Mary Cary. The scene and cos
tumes for this production were de-
signed by Edith A. sternfeld, pro-
fessor of design and painting.

Au orchestra composed of Chester

Victur Baumann. and Winifred Kelch,
added to the effectiveness of the
puppetrlike movements of characters‘
in the play through expressionistic
music.
