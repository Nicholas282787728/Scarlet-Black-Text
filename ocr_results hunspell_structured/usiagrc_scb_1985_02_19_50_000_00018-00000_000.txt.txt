. ‘ Grounds for Thought’

Picture in your head the continent oi
Africa. What do you see? At one level, it is
a multi-colored landniass in a iield oi blue.
At another, it is a vast windblown space

with a population or emaciated children.

tribal people being slowly herded to ships,

We are told oi lush rainiorests and jungles
there. but that the Sahara Desert is grow-
ing at a rate or 250.000 acres a year in all
oi these images is a sliver oi truth. but to
characterize Africa makes as much sense
as declaring that all North Americans
wear Mickey Mouse shirts.

The topographic picture ofAtrlca, which

so many oi us carry in our heads, iails to ,

impress us even with the size oi that conti-
nent. For many years, the standard map
projection (used by National Geographicl
has been Mercator Projection. which is
hundreds of years old, Everything above
the equator is enlarged, oiten grossly
distorted (Mercator was European. and
therefore made the important Countries
larger). Africa appears much more rounds
ed than it actually is, the mere trifle that it
seemed at the time.

Within the last few years. there has been
a change to the more accurate Peters Pro-
jection. which. even though it was created
by a West German. seems to take into ac-
count the vastness of Africa. and our own
geographical insignilicance. «

Likewise, the National Geographic
Society has stopped cutting the Soviet

States in the middle of the world, One has

One aspect oi the information age. as the
general thought used to be. was that we
were in the process oi creating a “global
village." Protest against the Vietnam War
swelled as we saw the results oi it nightly
on our television screens, Famine relief ef-
inrts for hapless Bangladesh were begun
when the televiSIon watchers of the
developed countries had the faces of the
hungry present at their dinner tables

What the iniormation age does not seem
to have done for us is instill in us a long-
term caring about the other neighborhoods
in our global village, We see hunger. we

Finally, and perhaps most directly
devastating to the Contadol‘a process. will
be the absence of Costa Rica. El Salvador.
and perhaps Honduras. irom the February
14-15 meeting. Ironically. these nations
stand to gain the most irom the revised
treaty

The boycott stems from an incident that
transpired last December 24. wherin a
Managua police oiiicer arrested a
Nicaraguan citizen as he left the Costa
Rican embassy in Managua where he had
hoped to gain Dolitical asylum as a draft
dodger. In outrage the Costa Rican

raise money to keep people irom iast and
dramatic starvation. and then we iorget, 1i
Ethiopians are merely starving at ole
.usual rate. rather than by the millions, we
can iorget, The inlormation age brings
also a form of information overload and
perhaps Airica has been one oi its victims.

The generally agreed-upon target ior inc
ternational aid organizations to request
irom iirst-vvorld countries is one percent oi
their GNP. The United States gives far less
than its one percent. and oi that. much is
military aid to our especially important
allies. We send guns to lsrael instead of
agricultural assistance to Brundi. Israel
has a domestic clientele in our represen-
tative democracy, whereas Brundi does
not and is rarely iound in the pedigree oi
United States Citizens. While President
Reagan has been known to boast about the
iact that his citizens are generous people
who give iar more than other countries. we
are unsurpassed in the size oi our GNP.
and can appear generous in dollar terms
while being pinchpennies by percentages

Despite the ditierent approaches to the
problems of famine in Africa. and the difr
ferent causes on which authors and aid
organizations concentrate (desertifica-
tion. inappropriate technology, over-
population, colonial exploitation, ll-
literacyt. the tact remains that one need
look no ‘farther than the United States
budget priorities to realize that we are not
being oi very much help, compared to the
lifesaving we could do in sub-Saharan
Airica it we could manage to concentrate
on it for more than a few months.

itself irom the peace talks. and int

support the boycott as well.

So. on the eve oi the latest round oi lalks'
concerning the prospects ior peace in Cen- i
tral America, it is understandable that
Mexico is making noises about being \vnr-‘
