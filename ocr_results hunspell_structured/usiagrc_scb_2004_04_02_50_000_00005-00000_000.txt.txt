Dirty Pretty Samurai

by Bradley lverson-Long 8t Kay Nguyen
Bradley: Everyone gmmbled as the dorm lockours lifr=d last weekend,
but the reopening ofHarris should soorh some ofrhc sting orthe lmpmcl-
ing six weelo ofsuffcring. over spring brmk, I had Lime to carry children

on my brick, rereh a little boy named Guillermo to
color a nlnbow and pick-ix: Marian ﬁelds. I also saw
an awesome movie, Eternal sunshine ofrli: spotless

Mind. Too bad I didn‘r see any orehe smiisr Harris
rhis weekend. Whoops.

The Last Samurai (R)

Kay: size does marrer; some movies, like Th: lax!
Samllrﬂi, are better seen on the big screen The storyline
beam no drama. Algren (Tom Cruise) is wasted and
dead bored in his mental limbo ar rasrclcss carnivals
after the Civil War. then forrunc comes and bring him
to ispan where he trains soldiers, righrs and gers cap-
ruredand stuFE Ir looks like a tedious, boring Kurosawa
wannabe, ifyou wsteh Lhe Fuzzy pimted version on your
tiny lsprop sereen \vlrh mufﬂed sound and uneomfy
dorm ebairs. Bur Harris ean make u big diirerenee.
Springbmk is over end schoolwork is piling Babel high,
bur or lent this weekend 1 my ehill out with semuroi
sgoin. ivithsbenerviewofgrsnd berries orerullyersﬁed
by direcror Edward Zwick.

B: Ipsssed over Thor/tirskmnmr diiswiiitcr. Icould
mime at least e dozen movies that looked more meane
ingful to me. But you're right Kay, iryou wont to see
Tom Cruise turning lspenese, tonight’s the night. The
battle seenes look epic, and hevebeen getting mves from
erirics. Ir grossed over $100 million, so some people
sure liked ir. The subiect merrer, the Meiji Restoration
thst modernized and Wcsreriiizcd Japan, is inrriguing.

Ultimately, this film, to me, wasnr rlre most im-
porranr movie this year ebourEest Wesr relations (thatd
be Lori in iinnrlm'ovi), samumi sword fights (Kill Bill,
ofeoriise) ora former Civil War soldier (try CoMMiirm—
min). The MrS/Imumi tries ro veil irsclfin mysterious
cxoticism of a foreign culture, but it looks very much

like a lumbering. soulless Hollywood production.
But ill srill check it our for rhe swordrighrs.

is in dzngcrofodxlng. Things brings rogerlrerAmelic's
