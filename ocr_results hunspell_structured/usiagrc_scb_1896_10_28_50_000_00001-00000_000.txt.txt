Professor Calkins’ Ordination.

The subject of President Gates’
chapel talk of last Friday inor »
ing was an item of very great in~
terest to the older students of the
college. To the younger stu-
dentstheannouncementthatRay-
mond D. Calkins had been ore
dained to the ministry was noth-
ing out at the ordinary, but to
those who had been intimately
acquainted with the gentleman
through classroom worle. or had
been pleasantly associated wrth
him as fellow members of the fac-
ulty the news was of surpassing
interest. The true worth of the
man is shown by the fact that in-
stead oi reaching out tor a high
position at the beginning of his
ministerial labors. although there
is no doubtbut that he is eminent-

-lv ﬁtted to ﬁll such a place, he

begins as a humble assistant in
the First Church of Christ in Pitts»
ﬁeld, Massachusetts. a church not
large as measured by the stand-
artls oi the world. but one doinga
great work for the cause of Chris
tianity.

The ordination services were

The Madison Game.

The report of the game last
Saturday reached us too late tor
publication that evening so it had
to he held over for this issue.
The story of the game is one with
which all are familiar and requires
but little space to recount. The
Wisconsin team was so evidently
the superior to ours, that the ims
pression produced upon the boys
is painful to think about. So
thoroughly entranced were they
that it is the general impression
that they are not as yet completely
in their right minds. True the
absence ot Capt. Templeman is to
some extent accountable. but with
the prospects of his returning to
the game now no brighter than
they were ten days ago, it seems
as if the team should soon learn
to place a little more reliance in
themselves. The ways in which
Wisconsin scored her 54 points
are too numerous to mention.
Lindsay ~scored Grinnell's only
touchdown by capturing the ball
on a tumble by Wisconsin and
making a so yard dash hotly pur—
sued by Atkinson. The lineup

was as follows:
