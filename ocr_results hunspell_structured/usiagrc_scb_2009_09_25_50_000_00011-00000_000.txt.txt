Where are those turbines?

If you're a prospective student arriving at
the Des Moines airport on your way to visit
Grinnell College, you might be confused by
an ad that greets you in the concourse. It
shows two wind turbines overlooking a coma
field landscape, praising the college as “farm-
ers of ingenuity." The turbines make for a
beautiful picture. It’s just too bad you can’t
see anything like it from campus—at least
not yet.

As alums who worked on environmental
issues at Grinnell, this ad is intensely fru5r
rrating. Grinnell claims to

we wish the College would spend its money
building it. Real “farmers ofrngennity" know

that actions speak louder than words.

Some of the events look pretty ticklish as well. On October

foods.I still haven't received an answer, howev’

Celebration" which will honor the two years that Lyle's Pub has
existed on the campus of Grinnell College, dating way back to
its opening in February 2008. The celebration will provide a
chance to reflect on the connections between the pub and the
college over the hundreds ofdays they have been together.

The events committee chose a beer theme
to mark the celebration because, for many
people, bccr- has always been a staple ofLyle's

the official events, participants oflegal age who
attend the celebration will receive the oppor
tunity to purchase beer, possibly at specially
discounted rates depending on the time or day.

In the meantime, Lyle's held its ticklish fall
semester opening earlier in September, and the
establishment has always been known to serve
up live music from a variety of artists, karaoke

and trivia nights and twentysfrve cent Natural Ice or Light on
Thursdays. This year should prove to be no different, and we

the way.

offer a bit of feedback of our own. First, the
response protocol is excessively vagueThe lack
of detail makes us wonder how some of the
mandates would even be feasible. For example,
the restorative justice component, though a
nice measure,docs not address the lack ofinsti-
tutronal support for this form of conﬂict reso—
lution. It is also clear that we have not learned
from our past mistakes. For instance,we could
have contacted all those most recently targeted
by a large-scale bias-motivated incident and
asked them to evaluate their
experience. Instead, we chose

the administration for years to try to reduce
the eampus’s carbon emissions with wind en-

that the College is seeking to capitalize on
the green cachet ofwind energy without hav-
ing put any actual capital into constructing
large turbines.

Because Grinnell has dragged its feet, is
has lost its chance to be a leader, both in the
nation and in Iowa. Last month, Luther Cole

up a wind tutbinc to power one third of its
campus. Luther expects the installation will
be completed by the summer ofnext year.

ODA that the “protocol be-
longs to all of us as thnnelljans.”

However, we are deeply concerned by the
imposed limitations on the time given to ac»
tively engage with the document. Administrar
tots took 18 months to draft and release the
document and yet we have been given only
five days ro respond (now four). This is an in
adequate amount of time to engge with the
policy, reflect on past mistakes, speak with
alumni, identify common goals and educate
ourselves about equivalent policies at other
institutions. This policy has the potential to
be an extremely useful and helpful tool for fu—
ture generations of students, faculty, and staff.
Since the administration released this docu-
ment over six months after it was promised,
the demand that we respond in less than five
days seems both unnecessary and hypocritical.

To start the conversation, we would like to
