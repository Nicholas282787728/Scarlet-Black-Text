they are the sounds of a normal
performance of Proteus.

Proteus is Grinnell‘s imr
provisational theater troupe
founded in 1985 by student
Jessica Thebus. Since then,
Proteus has become something
very different titan the troupe of
select members that it began as.

Today, organizers Brandan

teus closer to its unstated goals
and values: to develop acting
and improvisational skills, per-

“This is a rebuilding year,” said
McClain. “Last year there were ten

seven returned this year—the rest
are off—campus or gaduated.”

Film Series Focuses
on American Media

A ﬁl series entitled “Power,
Politics'and the Media" is spon-
sored this semester by the Rosen»
ﬁeld Committee. Grinnell gradu-
ate Brian Strause proposed the se-
ries as pan of a student project last
semester. l-le stresses in his pro-
posal the media's ability to shape
public perspective, and how this
capacity may lead to confonnily.

"The power of the television
image or the nwespaper headline is
a polent force in forming our na~
tional identity, "said Strause. "
There is no end in sight as the
public selectively stares at the
ﬂickering box in an isolation that
oﬁdly promotes conformity. Hole
lywood has investigated the inﬂue
ence of our free press since its early
days and its conclusions are any-
thing but congratulatory. From the

filmmmakers’ perspective, the
media is easily manipulated. espe-
cially when politics is involved."
'l'hei'rlms,whichareapartof the
Performing Arts fall ﬁlm schedule,
include Meet John Doe, Medium
C 00! . Nelwork and The Candidale.
The series will kick off this Wed—
nesday eveing with a Fonlm showy
ing of OrsonWelles' classic Citizen
Kane, which is perhaps the quin-
tessential ﬁlm about the manipula—
tion of the media. The next film
inthe series is Meet John Doe, die
reeled by Frank Capra. ltwill show
in the Forum on Thursday evening.
The “Power. Politics and the Me
dia " ﬁlms span approximately 40
years of American ﬁlmmaking, and
they are certainly a welcome addi-
tion to the usual balch of more
popular films shown on campus.

Last year, Proteus attained a
sizeablc local following by pre—
senting an enormous number of
performanceancludingall-campus
performances, charity perform-
ances, high school performances
and ﬂoor study breaks. This year,

an increase in the number of inter—
ested perfon'nets may continue that
trend.

"This year we had more than
twenty people at our second re-
hearsal," said Hooper. “It's great to
have new people, but we’re trying

 

to figure out how to handle
them.”

One of Proteus’ major goals
is getting SGA funding for the
organization, Hooper will be
presenting SGAwilhaproposed
budget this Friday. Any money
received from SGA would be
usedlobringin professional im-
provisationalisLs. and pay for
ofﬁce expenses, uniforms and
phone bills.

It's not always easy to attain
the level of trust required of
skith improvisationalists.

“You have to be willing to
give and lake,” said McClain.
“Youalsoleamloloseyourstage
fright. let loose and not be em-
banassedalsomethingyoudo."

Improv is about losing your
inhibitions. ”That seems to be
thehardestpartformostpcople,“
said Hooper.

People participate in such
theatre for various reasons.

“It prepares you better for
life because you can communi-
cate better.“ said member Tom
Klouda. a senior. “lmprov also
helps with school work and
communications: you learn to
link thoughts together without
stalling."

“Itopensupyourmind,"said
Klouda.
