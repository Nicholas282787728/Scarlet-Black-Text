sketches, will contain for the fac-
ulty department on article by Prof.
Nohle on the Whittier country, in
the midst of which he passed the

reminiscence, which Prof. Noble
has worked with his usual apprer
elation. There will be also a re
View of Prof. Nollen’s netv edir
tion of Kleist's drama, “Prin.

A new sport has recently come
to make its abode in Iowa College
whose presence SCARLET AND
BLACK makes haste to acknowlr
edge. Early in the year the
statement was made in one of our
society halls, that “golfwasrapld-
ly supersedingthe ﬁercer sports ot
tennis and baseball.” The truth
of this statement has been abund»
antly proven by recent develope~
ments. From the north campus
where pit falls are laid for the feet
of the innocent wayfarer in the
form of goltrholes. the links exe
tend to the remote iastnesses ol
Sanders’ pond, and the cattle are
startled from their peaceful rumi-
nations by appar-itrons as yet un-
paralelled in their experience.
The {ever has proved contagious,
especially among the taculty,
while students and town's people
are not exempt. A club has been

formed, ofﬁcers elected, links laitl
out and all things indicate it has
come to stay. While to the un-
initiated the charm of the game
appears rather-dubious, charm it
undoubtedly has, as is evidenced
by its rapid growth all over the
country as tvell as here in Gr-ine
nell, However, as a means ol
beniﬁcent and healthful cxercrses
it is certainly excellent, and we
hasten to bid it welcome and to
give it place in the list of our colr
legc activities.
