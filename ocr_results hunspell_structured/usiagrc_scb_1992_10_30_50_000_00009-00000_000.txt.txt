The Scots feature an option of-
fense that has good balance between
their running backs. This ball control
offense is keyed by an offensive line
thatCoachGrcgWallaeclcrmcd“big
and strong, but with good speed as
well.” Wallace satd,“We have to cut
outour turnovers, slow down the op-

tion, and put points up on the board in
order to win.”

AgainstComell last Saturday the
Pioneers had their highest scoring
day, but it was not enough to over-
come the powerful Cornell offense
that took advantage of five Grinnell
turnovers to win, 63-20.

After Comell‘s ﬁist score, the
Pioneers hit the scoreboard early in
the first quarter, when McCarthy re-
turned a kickoff 82 yards for a touch
down.

Cornell then added two moreTD

from the one-yard line. Stanley did
the bulk of the work during thedrive,
carrying the ball seven times for 34
yards.

Wallace said, “Turnovers killed
us. We started out very well offen-
sively and were in the game, but five
tumovers turned into 35 points, A
good team can notbe given thatmany
more opportunities to score.”
