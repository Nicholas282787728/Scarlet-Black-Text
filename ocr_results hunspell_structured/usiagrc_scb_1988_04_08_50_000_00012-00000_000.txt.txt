No, it doesn't have artificial turf.
and God knows the temperature
wasn't a comfortable 75 degrees,
but the Pioneer baseball field. with
the wind blowing out. resembled
the Metro (Homer) Dome this past
Wednesday, as a total or 62 runs
crossed the plate. Unfortunately,
the pioneers camp up just short in
their doubleheader against Simp-
son, losing 18-12 and 17-15. Not ex-
actly a pitcher‘s duel.

The Pioneers (0727 are coming
off an unimpressive spring train-
ing. After losing all tive games
down in Ranger, Texas, the
pioneers got hammered by Con»

, cordia last Saturday, 2373 and 2373.

l Good thing those games aren't
calculated in the team‘s ERA.

While they did come up empty
against Simpson, they did prove
that they can indeed put some runs
on the board. Now they just have to
work on the defense.

1 The Wednesday slugiest started
‘ in the bottom of the first as Simpv
son exploded for it runs on 4 hits. 2
k walks, and a passed bail. It was
i quickly evident that pitcher Jim

Wiea nd was in for a long atternoon,

Marty Hunsucker got the
Pioneers on the scoreboard in the
bottom or the first, knocking one
over the left field “fence". With the
bases loaded and nobody out and
the wind gusting out, it looked as it
the Pioneers would be right back in
it. Then the Simpson pitcher pro-
mptly struck out the side. Leaving
runners stranded on base would
prove to be a nemesis for the
Pioneers all afternoon.

Simpson continued the onslaught
in the second, picking up three
runs on three hits, to make it 1071.
Just as the 10 run rule was ap-
parently imminent, the Pioneers
scored 4 in their own half of the sea
cond. Kulakowski doubled,
Monogue singled, and Lin homered
to left-center to make it 1075. with
much more to come.

Simpson got a couple more runs

seemed like walks) in the third and
iourth, on an insiderthe-park
homerun and on a lost fly ball in
the sun. But Grinnell came charg-
ing back as Mohan pulled a three
run shot down the line to make it
lZ-B.

The pioneers inched closer in the
iiith, atter a Seeley double up the
middle. A Texas leaguer and an er-
ror scored Kulakowski. Mohan
lad oil the sixth with another hard
shot down the line; this one was a
double, Squibb got a hold or a
fastball to tie it at 12. This ilr
lustrated a damn good run by the
pioneers, Down by as many as 9
runs, they were able to nip and
crawl their way back into the
game. as Sheridan's crafty pil-
ching held Simpson to only two
runs, It‘s a shame they had to play
the seventh, Things were going so
Well.

The terrible Seventh. . Two
doubles and two singles made it
14-12, and a grand slam gave Simp~
son a 13712 cushion. Things looked
had on the homelront.

While the Pioneers did make a
gallant run in the bottom at the
sevenih 7 loading the bases on a
l-lunsucker double and a Lin single
— their Achilles heel came to
haunt them once again. leaving
runners stranded on base. Final
score Simpson in Grinnell 12. That
one really hurt.

It the let down in the lirst game
was bad, the breakdown in the se
cnnd was unbearable. When it look-
ed like Grinnell had it in the bag,
up 8-1 at one point, all hell broke
loose. It's still hard to believe.
Grinnell went into their halt oi the
third tied 1-]. Consecutive singles
by Miller and Weiand coupled with
two walks, pushed the score to 21.
A Mohan single upped it to ti.
Then ireshman Keith Kromash

stupid me.

Each team scored a run in the
fourth, Then Steinman lost control
in the fifth. After an infield error
on a walk, Simpson’s outfielder hit
Sieinman's curve ball but to left.
That made it. 5-5. That was all for
Steinman. who despite that
mistake really was a bright spot
for Grinnell.

In their half of the fifth, Grinnell
put up live more runs. They were
even one hit away from ending it
all on account of the ten run rule
but nacho... Simpson's sixth was
even worse than their seventh in
the previous game. They exploded
for ten runs off Grinnell pitchers.

The Pioneers only managed one
more run in the last two innings.
It's hard to imagine a loss more
paintul than the hrst. but the se»
cond one easily surpassed it. Grin~
nell had a victory right in the web-
bing of their mitt, when the root
caved in.

Assessing the debacle. Steinman
calmly stated. “No comment He
had plenty to say, just nothing that
was printable. Randy Seeley was a
little more eloquent saying, "rm
disappointed that our offense
would produce 27 runs and still
come up with no ‘w’s‘ ”. Well. at
least they hit well.

if Grinnell's field does continue
to resemble the Metrodome. let's
hope it also w'll give Grinnell some
of the Twins 1987 magic. The
Pioneers take their hats, and
hopefully their gloves to Coe on
Saturday. On Tuesday, the
pioneers play a doubleheader at
home against Cornell.

Think defense!
