“There wot no one on campus in nudjunuaty, I>icsi

Allen said the Baalﬂi ofTrustccs had asked the task
force to issue a report by tho cud otDccciubcr. “Many
of us fair wo wtrt under the gun to get something out
promptly," he said. "Thar: nus certainly no desire to
discntrunchue" the student body

Heirernin and Ford ashtd why students had not
played a larger role in dctcrmlning the makeup orthc
sweatshop task iorcc, selection and decision-maklng
“was not clone in a democranc nianncr, oran open man
not." according to Ford

Allen responded that tho committee had pksemcd
the opinion oIa majority orits members, “To say that
this is somehow undemocratic... I think is ovsrsraring
things a bit," he said.

\varpehoslti questioned why the committee decided
to remain in [11: FLA, despite the fact that only thsw'RC
had a large amount otorganiicd support on campus
