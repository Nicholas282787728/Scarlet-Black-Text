track in the fourth period when fresh«
man quarterback Josh Magden con—
nectetl with tight and lake Boyer for

COMMENTARY BY

Title thasbeen apowcrful tool
for increasing the number of oppor.
tunities for women athletes during
the last 23 years, but it is clear that
new changes mustbe now be consid-
ered Duringthelastcoupleofweeks,
the SSLB has discussed some of the
various issues concerning the need to
update and evaluate the role of Title
IX in athletics. Now it is time for us
to address what we see in thefuture of
Title IX.

Schools should not be dropping
men’s athlet ic programs to come into
compliance withTitIe 1X. The point
ofTitle IX is to guarantee women the
right to participate on an even field,
not to take away opportunities from
male athletes So why is it that
schools continue to drop men s pro-
grams such as gymnastics, wrestling,
and even baseball? Since I982, 29
Division I wrestling programs have
been disbanded by their institutions
(Sports Illustrated, March 27, 1995;
p I S ).

however i not true for many pro—
grams.’ One third of the Division 1
football programs run annual deﬁ—
cits, which average more than
$1,000,000. 0on onerfifth of all
college football teams even cover
their own expenses (Sportslliustiatr
ed, Februrary 6, 1995; p15).

Not only do football equipment
and supplies cost large amounts of
money, but the schools also put a
lutge amount of financial resources
into recruiting and scholarships.
Division I football teams can have up
to 85 scholarships. Imagine if the
numberoffootball scholarships were
to bescaled back. Notonlycouldthe
smaller athletic programs at the col—
lege or university receive extra ii.
manual assistance (anextra I 5 schol—
arships would provide tuition aSSIS'
tance for almost an entire wrestling
ream), but by paring down the niirn.
ber of scholarships given in football
players, it would also improve the
competitiveness of college football
Instead of having a few powerhouse
programs stockpile talented athletes,
who then sit on the bench for three
years behind the mass of talented
athletes, these skilled players would
be spread out among the schools.

Donna Lopiano, the executive

directorofrhe Women’sSpotts Foun»
dation, argues that it would he bener

ficial to take the ssseheiarship's,‘

which are now going to 85 players,
and make them partial scholarships.
Lopiano says “Let 5 reduce that to 50
or 60 scholarships, but still let it go to
