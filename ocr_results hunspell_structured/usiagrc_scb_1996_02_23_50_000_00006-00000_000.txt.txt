Poverty

13‘! MILES STERN

Almost ten years ago, in the
spring of 1987, national homeless
advocate Mitch Snyder shared his
views about the world with Grinnell
college students. He issued a chal.
lenge for students to get involved
with homeless issues and to educate
themselves about homelessness in
general. Inspired by his words and
deeds,agroupofthosestudentsfound—
ed an organization to address the
needs of homeless in Iowa and the
country. According to the oiiicial
documents. one day later, a Contact
had been made with the Kindred

that point, the group Students Help—

Poverty Action Nowl (PAN‘) in
1990 to sound less condescending
and make the political message clear»

The (Other State of the Union

By BRUCE Maroon

1 was watching one of those po—
litical talk shows, and the pundits
were waxingeloquent about how“lib»
etals" are always trying to wage a
class war. Lynn Cheney was partic«
ularly vitriolic, seething her disdain
for class analysis. I found this amus~
ing, in a macabre way. Clearly, on a
global scale, the rich multinational
corporate interests have been eprOiP
ing workers and poorpeople for some
time. At home now, as well, we find
the rich sedulously waging an all out
war against the poor, attempting to
bring the third world to the United
States.

Presently in the United States,
we have small sectors oipiivilego,-a
imrnumberoipeoplelivinghandsto.
mouth but getting by, and a vast and
growing sector of people livmg in
poverty and squalor. This lastiswhat
Chomsky calls the “superﬂuous pop»
ulation." Generally, they are con—
fined in slums or prisons, so that
"respectable people” needn't look at
them. Mate and more, they are fam—
ilies, children, people from other
countries. I have spent the past six
years of my life as a member of our
nations “superfluous population," and
Ican assure you that it isn‘t pleasant;
no one is there by choice; and none
of these people are less “worthy" than
myself or any of us.

In discussing “the (other) state
of the union," I would like to first
discuss the problem of poverty, then
what the government and cotpotate
interests are doing to entrencli pov—

erty, and finally offer a few thoughts
about an apposite response to the
problem.

Tm: Boom ECONOMY?

We find. these past few years,
banner corporate profits combined
with sinking wages. Indeed, 1995
was the fourth straight year of don»
blerligit profit growth and the 14th
straight year ofdeclinitig real wages.
According to NYU Economist Ed—
ward Wolff, during the 1980s aIIcre—
ated wealth went to the richest fifth
of the population, the top one per
cent increased theitshare of national
wealth from 33 to 39 percent from
1983 to 1989. Indeed, between 1979
and 1989, real income doubled for
the richest 1% as it fell 10% for the
bottom quintilc. Yet the neoconsen
varive economists continue to preach
economic growth as the solution to
poverty, holding on for dear life to
chimerical notion which is clearly
baseless. The top one percent of our
nation now has as much wealth as
the bottom ninetyrﬁve percent!

According to the census bureau.
14.5% ofUS citizens live in poverty;
25% of children in this country are
born into poverty. The poverty rate
for children in this country is 400%
of the average iii the other Western
Countries,and twice that in the next
highest, This is more than twice the
rate of any other western country!
Halfofpoor children live in families
where the family income is less than
halfthc official poverty rare. "lliis is
an outrage which should be filling

thepapers. Already,23,000children
die in this country every year from
poverty (Food First).

So what is the response from

border; 5)Blame the poor for their
poverty.

1. THE END OF WELFARE

Clinton vows to "end welfare as
we know it." because we “shouldn‘t
pay the poor for doing nothing." So
What is he doing? Well, he proposes
a draconian plan involvmg block
grants to the states, a work require
merit; a lifetime limit ofS years (no
matter what); a cap on benefits, so
that ifyou have more kids, you don’t
get more money; and a requirement
that children under 18 remain living
with anadult to receive benefits (the
idea here is that these families won’t
be poor enough to receive benefits),
Of course, states are free to be more
severe if they wish, but only with
presidential approval. Thus, Clin—
ton has “freed [40] states from Fedetr
al rules,“ to use his proud words.

Has welfare spending really got—

In the 80s, federal aid to cities
fell 60% and federal welfare benefits
fell 40%, health care fell 49%, hous—
ing subsidies fell 77%, and job train-
ing fell 48%. in 1987., when Reagan
and the Democratic congress slashed
taxes, pumped up the vm budget,
deregulated industry, and slashed
social welfare programs, they knew

they knew that the 1982 policies
would cause a crisis down the line,
requiring a viciouscut in“discretion—

willing to wait. since they couldn't
get the cuts they wanted when they

just between 1970 and 1994,

doesn’t jibe with corporate interests,

finer points of Virtually identicalpro
