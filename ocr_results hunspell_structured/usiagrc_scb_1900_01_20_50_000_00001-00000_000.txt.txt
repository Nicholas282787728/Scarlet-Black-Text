There will be a meeting of the
Goodnow Scientiﬁc Association
Monday evening at eight o’clock,
at Academy chapel.

Grinnell Institute.

A program of well prepared
numbers was presented before a
good attendance or the Grinncll
lnstitute Wednesday evening.
Most ot the numbers were present»
ed with an earnestness and inter-
est which is essential to good so-
ciety work.

Mr. Lyman was tlle ﬁrst on the
program, speaking on the subject,
“Senatorial Elections." He hand-
led his subject very exhaustively,
showing the corruption connected
with the present system of clect-
ing United States senatorsand pre-
sented some very good arguments
tor changing to a system similar
to that used in the election of
representatives.

Mr. Parish was next on the pro-
gram with a reading. He was folr
lowed by Mr. Gleysteen, who gave
a paper entitled “Colonization."

'He showed thorough preparation
and presented his paper well,

The music of the evening was
furnished by Miss Margaret Ma-
cornack. It was of the usual high
grade which the friends of Insti-
tute so kindly iurnish.

The extemporaneorrs work was
by Craver, on “The Senatorial
Election;" Dickinson on “The
Hepburn Canal Bill," and Mace
Farland on “The Delagoa Bay
Affair," All showed a fair knowl~
edge of their subjects and spoke
well.

The program was closed by a
“Controversy" between Strauss
and Shepard over the century
question, Mr. Strauss maintaining
that the century began Jan. r,
1900, and Mr. Shepard that it be-
gins Jan. I, lgol. It developed
into quite a warm discussion and
elicited several volunteers who
spoke on the subject.

Ellis.

The Ellis meeting on Friday
atternoon was opened with vocal
music by Mr. Oswald Risser,
“Rechte Zeit" and "Herbstger
fiihl,” by Nevin, which were well
received.

 

Fannie Pinergave a review of
“The Little Minister," which was
presented in a way to give one a
clear and connected idea of the
story, and though somewhat long,
did not become weaiisomc. The
discussion of “The Modern Girl
vs.the Colonial Girl" was made
unusually interesting by being
grvcn as a discussion among Cole
lege girls who had gathered in one
of their rooms to study Latin.
Ellzabetll Risscrand 'Anna Shiley
upheld the cause oithe modern
girl against Grace Grenage and
Eliza DeLong, who boldly cllamr
pioned the colonialgirl'scause. A
chapel talk by Inez Woodford
cleared up many ragged ends
or ”housekeeping," and through
this it was announced that chapel
attendance will be required for
the next four weeks. Judgmg
from this talk, Miss Woodlord unr
doubtedly is faithful in attendance
on Friday mornings, at least.

The program closed with a vocal
solo by Florence Anger, which
was heartily applauded.

lOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, lOWA, SATURDAY, JANUARY 20, 1900.

Cleveland Moifett.

The Tissot paintings of the life
of Christ were presented at the
congregational church Friday
evening by l\'Ii-.Cleve|and Mofiett.
An unusually large audience was
present. Mr. Moffet's lecture Cone
rrectirrg this superb series of pie-
tures proved very interesting.

Tissot was introduced as a man
whose early life presents a strik-
ing contrast to his later years.
Born of rich parents he was a man
of fashion and a of the
theater, even at the age of ﬁfty.
His reputation as an artist was not
great at this time. Though a man
or great spiritual power he had
not yet revealed hintselt.

In his ﬁftyesecond year, how
ever, the death of a loved one
brought about a sudden change.
He became a man of solitude. a
man of intense feeling. It is at
this point that his lite work really
began, He spent ten years of de-
tailed study and research in the
Holy Land, seeking to solve the
problem of what sort ot a man
Jesus really was.

It is Tissot’s inﬁnite capacity
for taking pains that ltas made
truthfulness the most prominent
characteristic of his art. By his
untiring efforts he has been ens
abled to produce four hundred
paintings within ten‘years and he
intends to paint a series of Old
Testament pictures or like num-
ber before he dies. This isthc
spirit of the man—“It is not work,
it is a prayer."

The views which Mr. Moﬁctt
used in illustrating hislecturewere
not all reproductions or the Tissot
paintings. some were photographs
taken by himselt ot places oflnr
terest in the Holy Land, showing
the exactness in detail ol the orig
inals; others were reproductions ot
the masterpieces of other great
artists, presented for purposes of
comparison. “Tile Holy Child-
hood," the “Ministry," “Holy
Week," the “Passion" and the
"Resurrection" were taken up, and
the earthly careerotlesus set tor-th
in natural order. Thesuperb col-
oring and the beautiful landscape
setting of these views must be
noted.

exactnessofTissot'sart.theblends
