It wus n disheartening weekend for
the Grinnell men's soccer team, The
Pioneers suffered a part of tough losses
against Lawrence and St. Norbert, of-
freially eliminating the team from the
conference playoffs this season.

During last Saturday's game against
Lawrence, the Vikings held the Pior
neers scoreless until the last minutes
of the game, leading 24) until forward
Andrew Walsh ’09 scored during the
77th mirurre of regulation to bring
Grinuell within one point ofLawrcnce
befale the end ofthc match.

“We didn’t have time to score again,"
said midﬁelder Kip Kelley '06, “lfwc'd
had another ten minutes, we would’ve
won We played some ofthe best soccer

ofthe whole season in [11.“ game."

On Sunday, St. Norbert scored diirr
ing the first minute of the game after a
Grinnell player slipped near the goal
The Pioneers answered quickly with a
goal by Walsh during the third minute
of the game. St. Norbert put another
point on the board after u penalty kick
was awarded to the Green Knights for
u questionable foul in the first half of
the tnutcli.Two more St. Norbert goals
during the second half sealed the Pier
neers ftitc, sending them home with a
4 1 loss.

“Everybody going into the game
[was]-coiitributing," S‘Ild Coach Erizui
liiworski. “It was ii l‘e‘rll team effort. It
was it rnnch closer game than 4-1."

Unfortunately the men were mnrlr-

enmricrllly eliminrred from the Mid-
west confcrente playoffs after the loss
oftheirgiime against St.Norbert. Holw
ever, the men played much better than
their season reﬂects.

"[lt] just hurts when you’ve develr
oped as 11 team but you don't get the
results," said Jaworskr.

The men have not given up yet de‘
spite the demoralizing effect of being
eliminated from conference. With four
games left in the season, the Pioneers
still have a chance to play some excel-
lent matches,

The upcoming game against Lake
Forest will provide some anticipated
competition for the Pioneers Luke For-
est has been in the top four ofthc Midr
west conference for the lust fcw y.c:irs

”I think our guys are really focused
on going out and winning a big game,"
said Iiiworski. “In order to beat Lake
Forest, we'll have to play to our pater-r
rial ”

“One good thing about this team
is were pretty young, said Kelley “Us
seniors are rhinking about how we can
contribute to the program in years to
come."

“This team plays harder, more to
gcther than any of my previous years
have," said co-captinn jefTWallnce ’06.

Men's soccer is not over yer. The
Pioneers are planning to end 2005 on
n high note. “Ifwc can finish the season
strong by getting a few wins, that'll le~
.rlly serve as u springboard for the next
sciison,"snid Kelley.
