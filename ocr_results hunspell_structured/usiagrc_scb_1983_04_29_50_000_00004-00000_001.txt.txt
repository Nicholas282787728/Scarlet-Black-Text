George Drake. well-loved golden-boy
president of Grinnell College, will leave his
post at the end of the current academic
year to accept a position with Gelltlemell‘s
Quarterly (60) magazine as a men's
fashion model. *'

“I'm truly tickled." the effervescent
prez bubbled recently in an exclusive
Scarlet Lind Black interview, "I'VE never
told, anyone this, but my life's true amblr
tion has always been to model dress shirts
and scanty designer underwear. I'm con-
vinced that modeling is my life’s true call
mg,"

When asked what will become of his
scholarly life. Drake replied, "Gosh, I've
already read everything lhere is to read
and said every pertinent thing that has to
be said,"

He smiled a dazzling Smile and added.
“so I guess that leaves modeling as the on
1y avenue in me to satisty my personal
goals and desires,"

Drake said that representatives from
several men's fashion magazmes had can»
tacted him within the past year, following
his “discovery' by a major New York
modeling agency The agency, Real Handa
some Guys, lnc , received a picture of the
strapping Drake from an anonymous
source.

“We knew_we had a real find when
George's picture turned up in the mail one
morning." said a press spokesman for the
agency."'lt’s not often we run across
models who moonlight as presidents oi
small midwestern liberal arts colleges."

The agency ‘leaked' the pictures to a
number of men's fashion periodicals, in
cluding Playboy Fashion Annual, 60, Es-
quire. and Popular Mechanics,

The first to approach Drake was PFA,
but gentle George would have nothing to do
with a publication that published
photographs of scantily»clad women. "Not
me," said Drake, “I once saw one of those
magazines back in college, and I swore
them off forever,".

The next publication to approach him

Winnie the Pooh and Sleepy LaBeef.

saying only “It takes a really big man
to be a Soviet Diplomat.”

 

 

 

Librarian Christopher McKee, flushed with success, promises even more addi-
lions atop a Burling. “We plan In consolidate many campus acu' lies here in Burl-

Goldsmith, head of Nuke and Lay Wane, commented, “This addition should pro-
ve very useful for oni- oi-gnnizaiion, especially tor our various reconninssance mis-
sinus and such.” Dan Klan, concerts choir, added, “This place is hot, totally hot!”

Grinnell goes Pcmbellem'c

by Magic Johnson

Citing an increase in alcoholic consump-
tion and a decrease in almost anything else
to do on the Grinnell College campus.
Trevor lvy, a representative or the
American Panhellenic League, has an
nounced the institution of several iraterv
nities and sororities on campus.

“We thought that this campus was ripe
for such a move," said Ivy, dusting some
white powder from the lapel of his
midnightrblue blazer. “The kids here
should really go for something like this
Greek life is the max at Iowa State, and
they‘re really hip."

Plans tentatively include accominndar
tions for three fraternities and two
sororities. The fraternities will be located
in the now-vacant houses on Park Street,
and the sororities will be located In Gates
tower and in the basement of an unnamed
administrator‘s home.

President George Drake gave the sure
prising plan the go-ahead last week alter
he began meeting with Ivy to discuss the
proposal He denied any breach of college
policy in allowing the Greek houses on
campus.

“Yes, this is new for the college,” said
Drake, dusting some white powder from
the lapel of his midnight-blue blazer,
“However, the administration is in agree
ment that fraternities and sororities are
the wave of the future and we want to be
part of that."

Drake said that lunds for preparing the
houses for the fraternities would be taken
from the Sloan Foundation grant which is
supposed to allow growth in the college,
Refurbishing expenses for the houses will
total $325,000, but many administrators
ieel justified in spending that much
money.

“We had had a long day, we were tired,
and it Seemed the right thing to do," allow-
ed Waldo Walker, vice president of the col»
lege, dusting some white powder from the
lapel of his midnight-blue blazer, “We can
afford the cost. I'm looking forward to it,
actually."

Special ellorts have been made to ap-
pease the various segments of the student
population in designating the houses.
Fraternities for Jewish students and black
students are planned.

The Jewish fraternity, Zeyda Layda
Shiksa, Will be located at 1217 Park and
will be headed by Lance Goldstein, .lr.

“We’ll have lots of fun and beer, and
we're not going to be your typical Jewish

frat at all,” said Goldstein. l-le excused
himself early from the inteerew to un-
tangle his gold chains from his Uzi Sub-
machine gun.

The primarily black lraternity, tenr
latively called the New Jersey Nets, will
be housed in 1008 Park. House Leader Rich
Washington complained, “I don't see why
we're being put so far from campus,"

The omer traternity is expected to pro
vide a long-sought replacement tor Pine
Tree House and will be called Doowa
Bonga Dey. Hap Golightly, house leader of
die group nicknamed the “Doo-Bs", in»
dlcated his pleasure with the new fraterni-
ty,
“Who says Grinnell isn't a party school.
man? I think this frat could be real cool,
y'know'!" said Gollghtly through a purple
haze,

,The sororities are expected to be
especially popular and may even provide a
source for Grinnell cheerleaders in the
future. a fact that has Head Football
Coach John Martinek beaming.

Martinek Said, “I think the whole thing
is a great idea. We’re finally getting our
priorities straight around here. Now my
boys will have a real incentive to win when
they look to the sidelines and see those
girls going through their motions,"

One sorority, Gotta Lotta Thigh, will
take it easy for the first yeal‘. “We don't
want to look ridiculous or anything,”
stated sophomore Cindy Suzee, "Sure,
we'll have parties, but we believe that
studies come first,”

Suzee then dashed from the interview to
get to her favorite soap opera in time.

The second sorority, Wamma Bamma
Slamma, nicknamed the Wam Bams, pro-
mises to be a bit rowdler than then‘
counterparts.

"You can count on us to provide the
entertainment on campus," exclaimed
Wam Bam social coordinator Lolly Holt.
“We Wam Bams can't wait to get under
way."

An attempt to bring a chapter or Phi
Slamma Jamma to Grinnell fell through
when it was discovered that nobody on
campus was as cool as Houston Cougar
Clyde “The Glide" Drexler.

lvy lamented. "We tried to put a pm
Slamma Jamma chapter here, but there
just aren't enough guys who can slam a
basketball and shut down Scooter McCrae
of Louisville at the same time. I'm awfully
Sorry."

Violate

olic
End slay 32

by Masters and Johnson

A bold and daring offensive attack by a
crack squadron of United States Marine
commandos took the lives of 32 unfor»
lunate Grinnell College students last Tues-
day, only to find themselves in direct viola-
tion oi a college policy lorbidding the mass
slaughter oi collcgestudcnts or start. This
violation prompted their early departure
from campus.

According to William Deminoff, director
of college relations, the Marines called
him early Tuesday morning in order to ar-
range an appearance on campus
Deminoll denied prior knowledge oi the
use or live ammunition during their visit.

"It took me completely on guard," said
an apologetic Demlnoff, "The whole thing
was just a case of lniscommunicaiion."

Maior Lance "Bulldog" Goldstcin, ho
commanded the operation, declared, We
did not know that we were doing anything
out oi line here. We're really sorry.
especlally about the mess.“

The Marine assault commenced prompt-
ly at 0900 hours, and by 10:30 a group of
about 20 students had gathered in the
Forum to conduct a silent protest of the
military presence.

“We’ve conducted military operations
all over the state and we've never seen a
reaction like this," said an unidentified
Marine. “Usually they’re too shells
shocked to put up much of any kind of a
fight."

The policy has existed in unwritten torm
for “as long as I've been here,” said Dean
of Student Affairs Jim Tederman. Teder-
man has had problems with unwritten col—
lege policy before, and stated, “First the
dance policy, now mass slaughter. Jesus
Christ, do we have to put everything in the
damn book!’

An explicit policy to prohibit further '
such slayings will go before the Committee
on Student Life next week. The policy
reads: “The Ill rovoked attack of college
students. espe ly it it involves auti-
personnel weaponry. is expressly (oi-bid-
den on college property. violation of this
policy will result in the guilty party
mediate removal from the premises.

“We have never had this problem with
groups vrslting the campus before.” said
Deminoff. “I cermlnly don’t relish the
thought of informing the parents oi the
dead students. It's times like this dial 1
really hate my job,”

The Marines had left the campus by
noon and a moped~riding crew {rom
Bulldlngs and Grounds had been Called in
to remove the bodies from the premises.

Next week’s scheduled appearance by
the 101 Airborne Division has been tem-
porarily postponed for “an indefinite
period," said Tederman. “However, this
cancellation has nothing to do win. the re-
cent events on campus."
