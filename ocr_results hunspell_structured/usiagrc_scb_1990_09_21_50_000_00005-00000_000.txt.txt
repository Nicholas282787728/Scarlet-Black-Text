OPINION

 

OOMMON SENSE
Fear of a Double Standard

While liberals have made large
Lstrides in exposing and defeating
whiteiacism,other formsof bigotry
have received scantattention,if any.
IfI proclaimed myself a “while
activist," preached “white power,"
recorded an album called Fear of a
While Planet, wore a pin that read
“Say itand say it loud: I’m white,
and I’m proud," or a t-shirt saying
“It's a While thingiyou wouldn’t
understand," or expressed my
admiration of “while leaders“—
ifl did any of these things, society
would condemn and abhor me, and
not without reason. But in each
case, if the adjective “black"
replaced "white,“ then what would
have been regarded as a pernicious
example of white racism becomes
acceptable, and indeed normal. By
altering the adjective, everything
on the list becomes commonplace
in American society.
For genuine ignorance, stupidity
and racial intolerance, one needs to
look no further than the host of so-

called “civil rights leaders.” Louis
Farrakhan is an excellent case in
point. This champion of racial
equalityhascallediudaisrn a“guuer
religion," and in a speech some
years ago lauded Adolf Hitler as “a
great man." If a prominent white
official made the same remarks, I
wonder how long he would remain
a prominent white official.

Jesse Jackson also apparently
sees no contradiction in being a
civil rights leader and practicing
anti-Semitism,sinceheoncelabeled
my home town of New York
“Hymietown.”StokelyCarmichael,
speaking before students at
Princeton, asserted that “We must
take a lesson from Hitler.”

Liberals are vigilant in
condemning white racism whether
in Bensonhurst, N.Y. or the
Republic of South Africa, and they
criticize anything that they perceive
as the slightest bit insensitive, such
as required courses in western
culture.

After an alleged anti-black
remark, Andy Rooney faced
outraged calls demanding his
removal from 60 Minutes. Jimmy
Breslin’s insults to an Asian
colleague incurred anger and
reprisals as well. Butwhereare the
sensitivity police when Farrakhan
utters a line that would makeHitler
proud? A demagogue in the uuest
sense of the word, he continues to
speak on campuses from Wisconsin

'I'IIE LIBERAL LIBEBTABIAN
Our Newest Mideast Friend

Yes, justas I promised two weeks
ago, I'm back to explore a thrilling
political topic gracing today’s
headlines.

Ido not recommend, in any way
or form with the exception of a
peace treaty, US. cooperation with
Syria. However, Bush-
administration policy-makers,
obviously ignorant of common
sense and historic American
philosophy, have Welcomed the
10,000 man Syrian contingent to
the multinational force in Saudi
Arabia. Personally, as well as
objectively,l find itdisgusting that
we consider a despot like I-lafez
Assad our ally.

Why would the United States
welcome the Syrian initiative with
open arms? Let me play the devil‘s
advocate for a minute and pry into
the minds of the State Department
bureaucrats as to why we would
accept Syrian aid. Syria does have
,arelativelylargeandcapableartny.
Also since the mling proMarxist
Baath parties splitin theearly‘70‘s,
Iraq and Syria have been at each
other‘s W085.

Syri s worse enemy in the
region is Israel; however, with
memories of October, 1973 still
fresh (Israeli armor 50 miles from
Damascus), as well as numerous
defeats in smaller conﬂicts of the
19805, Syria has wisely decided to
“piayitcool” with thelsraelis. Syria
is also very willing to restore more
soliddiplomatictieswiththeUnited
States, which reached an all-time
low in 1983 . In recent years,Syria
has given the United States aid in
thehostagenegotiacionctisis,while

‘actually helping hostage Charley

Glass to escape.

Although Syria is a totalitarian
state vying to be the major Arab
nation, there is no doubt that Syria
wishes for a far-ranging MidrEast
peace plan. We must remember
that all Arab states, sans Egypt, are
still technically at war Willi Israel.
Perhaps Syrian goodwill efforts are
intended to swing theUnitedStates
into a less Israel—oriented position
in the peace process, of which we
must be an integral pan.

Keeping in mind the status of
the United States as the “Global
Policeman,” we must firstconsider
Syrian initiatives against the
sovereignty of other nations,
including our own. The most
greviousSyrianviolaLionofnationa]
sovereignty is the Syrian
involvement in Lebanon, which is
dragging into year 15. The 1976
Lebanese Civil War ceasefire gave
Syriaachanoetoexertherinfluence
over a region she always thought
her own, officially under Arab
League auspices as a “peace-
keeping forCe." Syria built up her
military infrastructure in the area,
especially in the Bekaa Valley,
where she set up terrorist uaining
centers and allowed the Iranian
Army to setup bases Iher

Duringthe lQSleraeli 'ative
against the Palestine Liberation
Organization (via the invasion of
Lebanon), Syrian units engaged
Israeli, Phalangist and South
Lebanon Army troops, in many
times initiating large battles. It is
obvious that the Syrian “peace-
keeping forces" were there to
preserve Syrian regional
dominance, whether by keeping

Eric
Krauss

the peace or not. After two wars
and the continuing Syrian
occupation, the once beautiful
Lebanon has been reduced torubble
and thrust into political chaos.

In our current pseudo—alliance
with Syria, even acts against the
United States and its citizens have
been put on the back burner. In a
1989 ABC—TV interview, former
National Security Advisor Robert
McFarlaine issued the startling
statement that a 1986 US. hosrage
rescue mission was foiled by Syria
when it shot down an unspecified
number of American planes,
awaiting final go»ahead, over
Lebanese airspace. Botlt“American
lives and equipment“ were lost but
no other clariﬁcation was offered.
In even more recent news. State
Department investigators have
determined that the bombing of
flight 103 overlockerbie, Scotland,
was almost certainly the work of a
specific terrorist group having
suongtieslouieSyn'angovemment

Even more disturbing than
Syria’s acts against other nations
are those directed against her own
people. The U.S. has, historically,
affirmed its delen'nination to uphold
human rights in all pans of the
globe. Syria, on the other hand, has
one of the most deplorable human
rights records in the world; the
Assadregimehasoonsistentlybeen
cited by organizations such as

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Read This If
You Don't Care

To whom it doesn't concern,

Apathy: it’s an interesting,
sometimes understandable, yet
invariably frustrating and
debilitating concept. especially at
Grinnell College.

Many of its are annoyed because
itoften appears standard practice to
describe students asapailietic. But.
as with any cliche'd uttering, there
is usually considerably more than a
kernel of truth to the statement.

Yes, there are many student
groups on campus who are anything
but apathetic (EIG, ARC, CBS,
PAFA and GLGA immediately
cometomind)but,byandlarge,the
students at Grinnell are not nearly
as involved in policy issues that
affectthem,ortheirfellowstudenls.
as they could be—and we, as
students, are all paying the
consequences.

Granted, every student has a
heavy work-load andbusy schedule
that they can use as an excuse to
avoid voicing complaints.
Unfortunately, it is just that, an
excuse.

We challenge each and every
one of you to prove that youdo care
about what decisions are made at
this school, about what happens to
you, about what happens toall of us
studenu.

One way todo so is through your
Student Government Association.
SGA has often been criticized for
doing little more than funding
student . activities, and
understandably so. Ironically,
though,SGAcanacceptonlyasmall
part of the blame, We are as
powerful, or as powerless, as
students wish us to be. If SGAdocs
not have the backing of the students
on any given issue, il is very easy
for administrators of the College to
ignore SGA protests. It makes
sense. It makes a lot of sense.

Itdoes not make sense, however,
for us to ignore such an obvious
reality; to not react to such an
obvious reality. SGA, believe itor
not, can be an excellent resource
for students, bul only if we divorce
ourselves from the “free-rider"
mentality (the belief that “I don’t
have to complain because
everybody else will”). Everyone
seems to forget, though, that only
works if everybody else does
Complainibut they don’t!

For example, the new parking
policy affects up to 2A0studentson
thiscampus. Manycomplairits were
registered on the SGA account
concerning the new policy; there
were no letters praising the new
system. It is a policy that the
students, very clearly, do not like.
Yet, for all intents and purposes,
there was no student opposition to
the policy. SGA sponsoredanOpen

Walker and James Work on the
panel. We ordered a fullrseating
arrangement, three microphones:

fewer than 30 students present.
Some issue, eh? Ask yourself if
Drake would be more willing to
revise the new policy with 30
students protesting a policy in an
cmpty»looking South Lounge or
with 200 students protesting the
policy. Will Drake fear student
response if the policy is kept as it
is? Theanswer is clear. We failed.

Likewise, SGA should makean
effort to maintain contact with
student advisors and HAC’s, who
can be a crucial resource for the

philosophy, “I‘ll scratch your back

what should be demanded by all
student groups of each other, and
the parliamentarian/SGL can help
such a philosophy ﬂy.

We’ll provide an example of
how students and student groups
