GOOD OL‘D DAYS

Stuart Chase 0 re a brilliant and interesting
anal. is of the world’s economic present and fu-
tnl here recently. lint he indulged ill one fallacy.
It was a fallacy doomed to offend modern young
people, because it contrasted their synthetic pleas-
ures lmfavorably with the supposedly wholesome
recreations of a generation gone by. It set up
modern insanity against old fashioned soundness.

Does the fact that halt? the cases in hospitals
are mental Show tllat mental diseases are increased
by modern life? Not at all. Mental diseases were,
never before recognized. The ogres, fiends, hermits

. and fanatics of old tales were not figlnents of the
imagination. The world was full of fiends and pelt
verts, hilt they were not ill hospital beds as they
are now.

Did simple oldrfashioned religion create a
peace of mind which modernized religion of today
denies? If that were true, religious massacres would
not fill the histories. The brutality of the inquisi-
tion could not find people to administer it in those
nervewrocked years.

 

Is divorce and the break-up of the home a

modern invention? Clytelnnestra (lid not divorce
