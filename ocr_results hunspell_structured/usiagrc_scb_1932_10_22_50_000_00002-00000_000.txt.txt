0N GRENDS

“Nobody loves a grim ”. Most of ils accept
that old saw without stopping to analyze it. It’s
true, of course, in a general way, but some grinds
lncrit respect for all that.

To some people college means only a place
to study, an institution ill which to assimilate book
knowledge alone. They make sacrifices so that
they may go to school ill pursuit of what they
consider the absolute quest for knowledge. They
realize that they are missing good times, grinds
are no different fundamentally from the rest of
us. They believe that they are doing the right
thing by themselves to forego pleasure for study,
and they have the courage to back their convic-
tions.

A large majority of us consider our associa-
tions and companionships are more important than
ranking top in our classes, but don’t despise the
grinds before you stop to think. Remember a great
many more of us would become booku'orms had

RETAINING- THEIR YOUTH

We adm 'e people who retain their youth as
long as pos blc.

We especially admire the younger freshmen,
surely not uppci'classmen, who, not wishing to dis—
card the humorous habits of high school, nay, grade
SClIOOl days, gather outside the library and howl
at more .tudious cl notes inside.

01? course, the r ultllilt racket is vcl {tilnoyr
ing to students wllo have become so aged that they
go to the library to stutlyibut of course they‘re
just “old logies” anyway.

As we said before, we lldlnire zlnyollc who re—
tains his youthful Ways as long as possible. \Vllut

THE DEATH OF THE BEARD AND THE
RED SHIRT
(The lilosleyoii)

Until very recent times, a socialist was described
as a squat, bullrnecked member of the Slavic race. He
had a stubby heard, an insane gleam in his eyes, and
wore a dirty red shirt. He concentrated his efforts upon
the demolition of society and exterminating the statues
quo of international relations. He was a chauvibistic
fanatic whom all thinking, or at least good, persons
laughed at or avoided.

During the past decade this has all been most dis—
concertingly changed. The reasons are varied and Sun
dry.

By far the most important cause for this change,
other than the fact that socialists have been found to
be not incendiaries, bomb~throwers, and assassins, is
Norman Thomas, socialist candidate for the presidency.

He pends his time writing scholarly books and de-
livering scholarly lectures. Before that he sat in on
scholarly classes at Princeton and at the Union Theolog-
ical seminary. Then for a time he delivered Scholarly
sermons to a Presbyterian congregation. At the en<
trance of the United States into the World war he
registered as a conscientious objector, Since that time
he has been active in socialism. ‘

He strode into national prominence when he was
leading a meeting of strikers at Passaic, N. .1. Police
raided the assembly and out off the lights. on the plat-
form Stood Norman Thomas reading the constitution
of the state by candledight. Baffled, the police allowed
the meeting to continue.

Since then Norman Thomas has run for every ot—
ncc 1mm alderman to president, and that he has never
Won an election is significant. The great increase in
support that he is getting during the progressing cam-
paign is not dependant on the lust for Victory. There
are no spoils. It is simply that Nominee Thomas, with
the same immaculate idealism that characterized Saint
Francis of Assisi and Lyof Tolstoy, is ambitions to re-
store society.

Public ownership or public ,utilities, low tariffs,
minimum Wage laws, federal relief for the unemploy-
ment, federal Supervision Of credit, and lessening of tax

burdens by transfer are the great planks of his platform.

Some will Vote for Norman Thomas 2.5 a gentle
protest. against the Situation in general, others because
of a disappointment in other candidates who Split. hairs
over issues of inconsequcnco. others because they are
radical, and others because they too have the same
lofty ideals for the society Lhey live in as does Nominee
Thomas. It iS these last. that are causing the trans-
formation of the former alleged bearded redshirt, and
these which upon occasion will hold the values of power
in an izlection.

The sooner the better say some.

SINCE 1918
(College Eye)

“Can the Germans bomb New York from the Air 7“
Way back in the time of the war, May 1313, two writers
in the Review of ReviEws attempted to prove the pOSsir
bility, but they did not picture German planes flying
all the way from Germany. They admitted the possibil-
ity of making a onerway trip by plane, but with only
one pilot and with all Equipment; left lleblnd to make
room for fuel.

Likewise, they admitted the possibility of a, One-
way Zeppelin trip, but as Waldemar Kaempffert and
Carl Dienstbach themselves said, ”A bombless Zeppelin
setting out from a German base and hovering over
New Yuri: is a military absurdity."

Difficulties presented themselves to these writers,
but. in each case they surmounted them with Suggestions
of Secret bases, of almost unmasable airplanercurrying
ships, and of impractical submarine carriers of from
one to three dissembled planes.

But today. after fourteen years, we see how really
practical their ideas were. Twice the great. aerial tri—
umph of Germany, the Gl'af Zeppelin,, has been in this
country, once in New York itself. Linrbergh and many
others have flown the Atlatic from this nation to Ger-
many and farther. Our U.S.S. Saratoga, our USS. Lex-
ingtoniyet in 1913 the people were cautioned against
thinking a Ship able to carry and launch one seaplane
impossible. New submarines are now built to carry
as many as nine seaplane: ready for action.

This truly is the Century of Progress. Next year the
World’s fair in Chicago will display the newest in archi—
tecture, in mechanics, in electricity, in amusement.
Youth undoubtedly has the advantage over age in to-
day's living, but in the appreciation of our progress
those who are old enough to remember the lost world's
fair will have a better background for the appreciation
of our Century of Progress.

GRAPHIC RECOVERY
(The Purdue Exponent)

As the year of 1932 enters upon the twilight period,
economists on every hand are turning over the chances
that a third country might this fall regain its strength
and vitality and push ahead to better times. One thing,
if nothing else, has been the conclusion of these fore-
casters of our economic weather. It is certain that at
no other period have we been able to draw our hopes
from a lower point than we are doing this fall, Charles
Merz, financial expert with the New York Times, says in
this mspect, “Freight ear loadings, one of the most rec
liable barometers of business, are down more than a
fourth from the low figure of last year; automobile
production, more than a third; steel activity, more than
a half."

To assist the imagination of those who are so sus-
ceptible to the lure of graphs and diagrams as the
engineers of Purdue, the Literary Digest has prepared
an extensive chart showing the trend of the "life lines
of a nation” since some few months 8. C. Upon four
phases of our economic life does the soundness of the
entire structure depend, is the opinion of the Digest.
They are business, commodity prices, stocks, and the
price of gold. Accordingly they have charted the sep-
arate courses oi these nerves of prosperity during the
country's nervous breakdown,

An inspection of the nervous system can leave but
one predominating impl'essionithat if it were possible
for one to ‘climb to the 1920 peak of the graph and
start down one of these inclines on a “graph-sled,” the

chances would be three to one in favor of his successfully ‘

reaching the bottom without ever encountering an up-
grade sufficient to neutralize his initial momentum.
Gold alone weathered the first catastrophe without Ser~

ious suffering; in {act it continued to rise steadily until '

August of last year when the ﬁrst run on American
gold sent it careeuing downward. Another similar run
Six months later was enough to bring it down to the
common level.

Does the entire trend of this chart convey only an

abysmal sense of hopelessness? A glance at the bottom ,,

gives us our one ray of hope that perhaps the tide has
tuined.

Stock prices, our most fickle indicator, during the
past two months, have taken the steepest uphill ten-

dency since'their tumbling act, which rise, lest you be i

too much encouraged. has taken them only a little above
their general level of a year ago, Commodity prices,

never before on eventbe slightest upgrade since Sep- .

tember of 1929, have decided that a new direction is
slightly desirable, and have evidenced this decision by
rising slightly .but nevertheless appreciably within the

last two months' period. Business is the blacicsheep '

among the financial family, for it has not betrayed the
slightest recognition of its associates' convictions but
has continued the downward path. Gold, however, has
fallen in line, and is on the upward trend in what op-
timistic economists believe to be a beginning of sub—
stimtial recovery.

It would be indeed interesting to be able to peer
over the peak of those hills, and sec whztt the graphic
Illtllre holds for those four vital nerves of our economic
system.
