the lastest hurdlors in the conicrcncc
last spring; Taylor, Valley outdoor
champion in the low sticks, who hails
irom the Sooner school; . Witmer,
Ames, and Penquitc, Drake, all very
capable men in the race. It is highly
possihle that the low hurdle record
may fall, but the mark of six seconds
(lat made by Keehle oi Missouri sev-
eral years ago, is likely to stand.
Whitley in Fast Field
Whitley will run the twosmilcv
grind, and will he Iorccd to face one
or the most select two-mile groups
ever assembled in the middle west.
Frazier, Kansas sophomore, turned in
a 52:31 race in the K, c. A. 0, games,
a mark which is the fastest at that
distance in the country this winter.
He also ran a 4:232 mile in a dual
meet with Missouri last wcck.Nihlaek,

 

‘ second in both distance events in the

outdoor championships last s ring,
will also he high in the running at the
end oi the trot. Whitley has turned
in several good runs this season, and
is expected to break the 10:00 minute
mark in this meet. .

Wyatt, Pioneer sophomore, will run
in the mile event, hut due to inexperr
ience, and lack of training facilities,
is given little more than an outside
chance. Hotrman will probably run
the sight-eighty, but a had cold has
kept him out oi the gym for several‘
days, and it is extremely douhtiul if
he can round into good shape, Mar.

should clear six iéet to win the event.

in the finals oi the contest. .
