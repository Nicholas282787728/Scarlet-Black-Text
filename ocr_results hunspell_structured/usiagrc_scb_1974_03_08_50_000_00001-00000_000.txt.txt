. by Elaine Carey

A moratorium on entorcement oi
the pet leash law has been approved
for about one month while the Pet
Owners Organization (P.0.0.) in-
stitutes a new dog patrol and train-
ing program designed to end mountr

ing pet complaints on campus.
P.0.0., which is comprised oi ne-
arly every dog owner on campus,
received approval to allow their
’dogs to run without their leashes
or without being in voice command
of their owners due to the ill ettr
ects caused to the dogs by the lear
sh law. Joe Feldman, who is head
ing P.0.0., cited lack of proper ex~
ercise as the greatest ill a dog sni-

The dog patrol, made up or 40 dog

patrol, Feldman explained, will stop
any dogs misbehaving, report them

to their owners, and then 110.0.
will send a person qualiiied in
dog training over to work with the
Problem dog and his owner,

If at the end of the moratorium,
complaints still exist, Feldman her
lieves that the patrol will be just
another “police system" but he
hopes that after the month, prob-
lem dogs will be known and can be
retrained,

At the end 01' the month-long morar

be held to determine campus senti-

be achieved from mutualcooperation
between the campus community and
dog owners during the moratorium,

Sago Ripoffs Pose Problem

by Kyle Schaub

students who casually carryout that
extra half an apple have beenfinding
it more difficult to sneak through
the dining hall doors.

Although taking out food is notanew
problem, the rate has increased sh—
arply, according to Ralph Pomer—
enk, Director of College Seerces.
Dishes have also started disappear—
ing at an alarming rate. '

Pomerenk answered the typical
student question, "It I can eat it
here, why can’t I take it with me?”
He said that the budget is planned
so that “everybody gets his money ’5
worth.” He added that students are
expected to miss 15% oi their board
‘ meals during the year, so that tak-

ing loud to make up tor a missed

meal is not included in the budget.
Limit

Pomerenk also said thatpeoplecan

eat only so much at one meal, and

that this "reasonable limit” is used

to help estimate the cost per stu-

O

dent per day, which is the basic
figure used ior the yearly Saga
budget

Thereiore, ii students repeatedly
take out crackers, tea bagsandpea—
nut butter sandwiches, the budget
calculations are thrown on, since
the “reasonable limit theory" does
not account for snacks later in the
day.

Lower Rate

Pomerenk commented that the rip-
oii rate was much lower when Saga
did not offer unlimited additional
servings and an open salad bar,
(Previously students could onlypick
up one entree, salad, beverage and
dessert during the meal.)

Hopeiully the posted reminders at '

each dining hall will help return a
little balance back to the (cod bud-
get, or the College may iind itseli
in the hole, according to Pomerenk.
He concluded. “People can’tjuststr
cck up as it they’re going to the
supermarket.”

wners To Police Pet‘s

patrol is 'open to anyone, whether
they own a pet or not. Anyone
wishing to help or who has ques-
tions should contact Joe Feldman,
John Ruane, or Bill Jollie.

Streaking: “to law

For the ardent streaking ians
oi Grinnell, there’s a word oi
warning irom the Grinnell Pol»
ice Department -» in Grinnell,
streaking is illegal.

Detective Sergeant James Ah.
rens told the Scarlet and Black
Wednesday that Grinnell's city
ordinance covering public nui-
sances applies to “streaking,"
and that it is constitutional.

Most luwa public nuisance or
dihances were recently ruled
unconstitutional -- but theGrine
nell ordinance, although come
plying with state law, is wordr
ed diiierently and thereiore is
still in iorce, Ahrens said.
