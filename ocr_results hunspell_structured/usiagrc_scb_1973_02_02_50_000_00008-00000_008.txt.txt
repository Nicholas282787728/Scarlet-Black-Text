"Ame 'i”

“i do it better then playing bridge,"
MS. Eleanor Bowers kidded while talking
about her position as a history teacher
at the junior high. l-ler degree from Grin»
nell College in History and teaching cer-
tificates from the states of Illinois and
Iowa certainly demonstrate the use she
has made of her higher education. Her
husband Edd is a professor of physical
education and football, golf and assistant
basketball coach.

Ms, Bowers returned to teaching after an
eightyear break in which she devoted her
time to raising her children. Later she
taught speech and history on a partrtlme
basis. Ms. Bowers has earned some grad-
uate credits, but has never embarked on a
planned masters degree because she has
always put her family first, She would like
to earn a masters, but explained it never
seemed fair to,just leave her family.
Despite this block, Ms, Bowers has tried
to keep up With her educational field, and
now is in the process of writing a speech
text with a collegue from Minnesota for
use in the ninth grade. Publication seems
a bit uncertain although the work will cer~
tainly be well—substantiated from her twenty
years of teaching experience.
in contrast to the working faculty wife,
Ms. Betty Moffett has decided not to at,
tempt a professional career even though
she has earned a masters degree in Eng,
lish. At the present she is more interested
in raising her 2 1/2 year old son. His
father, Alexander Moffett, is an associate
professor of theatre at the college.

Ms. Moffett did attempt to re-enter the
academic world by teaching part-time at
night school. However, her two proposed
courses, “Great Books” and speech, did
not meet the minimum enrollment require,
ment of ten and so were canceled. Ms.
Moffett sees part-time employment as a
good solution for educated people who
want stimulation but cannot afford the
time required for full time work.

Although she is not employed, Ms. Mof—
fett considers Grinnell 3 ”rich commun—
ity” that has “a lot of things to do,”
However she finds it difficult at times
to keep in touch with the outside world
and remain fresh in the area she was
trained in. In spite of this she still enjoys
her life in Grinnell.

One academic outlet the College offers
each semester to faculty spouses, which
MS. Moffett has taken advantage of several
times, is the opportunity to audit any cour-
se, free of charge. Using this privilege,
she feels she has kept fairly current in
her field of English

Thumsa Haas, whose husband is the col—
lege chaplain and assistant professor of
religious studies, spends her days work-
ing with pre-schoolers at the Day Care
Center.

"I love what I’m doing,” she explained
when asked if she considered her work
enjoyable. Although Ms, Hans does not earn

a substantial salary, she believes her type
of “success” should not be equated solely
with earning power

Ms. Haas earned a BA in sociology and
an MED, a degree in theology, and went
on to instruct prevschoolers at the church
she and her husband were connected with
before coming to Grinnell. She considers
her educational background and training
“invaluable" for the Day Care Center, alv
though only one other worker hasa compar-

able education. She commented that her
«to-workers are probably not aware of her
degrees and that practical experience to a
large degree determines competence at
the Center.

Education is still one of Ms. Haas’ in-
terests and presently she is toying with
the idea of becoming a certified elemenv
tary education teacherr As the College is
now offering courses in that field, Ms.
Haas faces real temptation,
