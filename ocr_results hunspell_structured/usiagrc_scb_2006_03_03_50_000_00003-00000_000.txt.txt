SGA Pres., VP pursue new agenda

John Bohman ’06 and Chris Ochoa ’06 aim to continue to fight student apathy
and represent students after a series of first semester accomplishments

By BEN SCHRAGER

students manned the dining halls with laptops at the start of
this semester, trying to get out the vote for local SGA senators.
More of the students living orrctlmpus voted, 58 percent, than the
55 percent of the voting age population in the country that turned
out for the last national election.

As students get ready to vote for the next SGA president and
vice president today, some students are skeptical orstudent goverm
ment. '

Despite the critics, SGA is the only institutional way for students
to access administrators, and the first semester of this administra-
tion made headway on addressing issues brought up by the student
body Last semester, SGA convinced college staff to allow students
to return the Friday after breaks, preserved Grab be Go and helped
to secure a buffer day at the
start of ﬁnals week.

Geirdcrsncutral housing.
increasing student wages,
andstreamlining SGA are
all on the agenda for this
upcoming semester as SGA
prepares to send off its set
nior class.

“Joint Board rs gonna be
smokin’," said Chris Ochoa

'06, son vice prcsidcnt/

”[Tlle faculty and adminrtrarlorl
staff] are entrenched Students
have a (hanging oft/ls guard
every four years.”
SGA President
John Bohman ’06

president ofAcademic Affairs.

Ochoa is referring to what is basically SGA’s senatoThoy meet
weekly to vote on budget requests and coordinate their actions.

While faculty and the administration are fixtures at Glinnell,
students are temporary. “They re entrenched," said SGA President
John Bohaman oo oi administrative staff. We have a changing of
the guard every four years.

Bob Grey, Political Screncc, remembers when SGA was formed.
“It was hoped by the idealistic and the naive that the students would
have at least an equal voice if not a greater voice in the college decis
sion making process,“he said.

It can be unclear how decisions are made at the college. Differ-
ent groups like the faculty, staff, administration, trustees and slur
dents are all trying to have a say in what gets done,

One of the biggest areas in which students have inﬂuence is com»
mittees. Historically, students have not always taken full advantage
of the role ofcommittccs in the college's decisionemaking process,

Students have the majority on the Committee on Student Life
and Dining Servrces Committee. There are nine committees listed
in the student handbook. Students are selected by SGA to be on

committees that are composed of students, faculty or administrae
tron.

Grinnell President Russell K. Osgood explained that he tries to
incorporate student opinion along with the concerns offaculty and
staff. “I think it is important to carefully consider recommendations
by our formal bodies,like SGA and the Executive Council,"he said
of his consultation with the primary governing bodies for students
and faculty respectively. “I also try to solicit opinions from a broad
cross section or people including staff, other students, directly at-
fccted people, in the ease ofa speciﬁc decision, and others."

SGA can only speak for the students. “You can’t do it alone is the
real problem,’explained Bohman. “You need a school with you.”

Trustee

Last weekend the
Board ofTrustees met

' Discussed tuition
with students at an
open lorum last Thurs-
day night

Trustees approve gender-neutral
housing, Cowles apartment plan

Wind turbine proposal received favorably, but not voted on

at NIKOLOZ SAKVARELIDZE

When Grinnell trustees showed up in the Forum
South Lounge lastThursday, they were met by Eli Zi-
gas ’06 and Emily stiever '09, who gave them plastic
pinwhecls and an appeal to support their proposal for
a campus wind turbine. The idea, a successful student
initiative, was sponsored by Free the Planet (FTP).

Over the weekend, the trustees expressed support
for the wind turbine proposal, but cited a need for
further economic early in tabling it. They also made
a number otothtr key deeisrone student Affairs’ gens
der-neutral housing proposal was approved, as were
the plans to convert Cowles Dining Hall into apart—
ment-style housing. The trustees also were informed
about a rise in student wages that had previously been
enacted.

Stievei and Zigas presented the prospects of the
Wind Energy Initiative. Their presentation called for
the college to build a poweregcnerating wind turbine
that was both “economically feasible and environs
mentally friendly,"The students also emphasized the
benefits for Grinnell’s image “The plojectwill have a
payback in social capital which includes positive pub-
lic relations, community enhancement and alumni dce
velopmcnt," according to FTP's report on the issue,

The trustees expressed support for the project,
but did not approve it. Further research will be done
about the economic implications of a campus wind
turbine bcforc anything is dccrdcd,

SGA and Student/\ffairs presented a gendersncus
tral housing plan to trustees on the weekend. Accord
ing to SGA President John Bohman on, even though
there was not a huge demand for the gender-neu-
tral housing in the college, the plan would r-cmrnr-ee

the college's commitment to openmindednessi The
trustees did not vote on the proposal, but according
to Bohman, that wasn’t necessary. “They didn’t vote
no, so it kept going,“he said, adding that the trustees
needed to be informed about final proposal but that
the administration would implement it.

The trustees approved a revised plan to build
new housing in Cowles Dining Hall, which will be
lett empty with the opening ofthe Joe Rosenfleld '25
Campus Center The plan called for renovation to
create apartmentsstyle housing. A previous plan had
been rejected in September at the board 's last meeting
because of high cost, but the college received a new
bid at a more acceptable price.

The trustees were also told about the recent rise in
student wages to account for inflation since they wcrc
last set. This is set to be enacted for next year .ind no
vote was needed.

In the meeting with students lastThursday, trust-
ees fielded many questions about tuition hikes. Ac-
cording to the trustees, the colleges tuition needs to
rise because the college iS too dependent on its ens
dowment for spending. Giving by Grinnell alumni rs
low compared to other colleges ofGtinnell’s size,

Trustee Bob Barr ’57 sured students that the
reason for the tuition rise was the increase in college
costs due to intlatron and the rise in salary for faculty
and other college cmployees,\vhich secure high quills
ity of education rd services in the college. Further,
Mr Barr empha d that the college was providing
the students with exceptionallvg wenerons financial aid.
T his, as the Trustee Thomas Barrett 97 said, made up
almost so percent ntcallcge costs
