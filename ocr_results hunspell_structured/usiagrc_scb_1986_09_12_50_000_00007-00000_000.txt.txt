The Human Element

By Jim Duncan

The dust billows into expanding clouds
behind the '69 Jeep Wagoneer as its deeply
etched radial treads gnash and churn the
dry, loose gravel. Broad arcs of dirt and
rocks are thrown back to cascade heavily
on the fresh tire tracks. Hanging low, the
morning sun glares down on the narrow
country road ahead.

I glance off to the west where the sky is
still purplish. With taut barbed wire strung
between them, evenly spaced fence posts
race alongside the weed—choked ditches at
the sides of the road, blurring hypnotical-
ly,

An intersection of county roads draws
closer. The Wagoneer vibrates violently as
the road becomes a washboard, uie result
of the constant passage of heavy farm
vehicles hauling produce. A tap to the
brakes and I glance for a second at me pit~
ted, wounded face of the slightly buckled
stopsign. the unfortunate prey for some
drunken, triggerhappy high-school
hunters joyriding with shotguns.

I reign in the panting, sneezing, wheez-
ing machine at the Crossing. The battered
and scraped pile of rust dies with a sudden
hissed snort, A frown cross my face as I
focus absentmindedly on the dozens of imr
pressions in the dustcolored, dusHtoverd
hood (from the baseballsized hailstones
that fell in the late summer of ’79).
Automatically, I reach for the ignition and
the Beast shudders into life again, I took
left, right, then step off the brake. My foot
hardens on the accelerator and With long,
loping strides, the vehicle leaps forward,
growling.

A few minutes later I pull into the
feedlot, the rolling gravel trailing close
alter. ‘

“Ever mended fence, son?” Mr. Rutgers
asks in his slow country twang, As we walk
alongside the enormous holding pens. all of
the heifers crowd up next to the fence to
observe our passing,

“Unh? Well, . . no.” I am hesitant. be-
ing unsure of his reaction,

He turns his head and scrutinizes my
work attire, from the sweatrstained
painter’s cap to the ill-fitting Trshirt to the
ripped and torn jeans with a patch here or
there to finally, the holiest of highrtops,

“Didn't think so.” It is his only come
ment. The silence that follows is awkward.

As we head toward the far end of the cor
rals, he occasionally turns away and
squirts a fine stream of brownish tobacco
juice through his purscd lips from the
bulge of chaw in his right cheek.

We reach the furthest pen. Mr. Rogers
pauses, flicks the brim of his hat back with
his thick. calloused forefinger, and digs in
to his rear pocket.

Spit. it glistens in the dust at my feet.

“Wanna dip?” he drawls, offering the
open tin of Skoal.

Letters. .Q .

Dear Editor,

Many students have adopted a rather
cynical view toward this college’s new
logo. I, however, would like to speak for
those students who see the immense
benefit of the new logo.

Some Complain about the the cost of the
logo, $40,000. the equivalent of almost four
students' full tuition. room, and board.
They think that this money could be better
spent on scholarship iunds, iinancial aid,
building repairs, or just about anything
else, To these humbugs, i say that a new
logo is a fine expenditure of money, and it
is better than students don’t have too much
financial aid. Do you want everyone
around here to get soft?

Some say the design is too simplistic. I
say the leaf represents good. honest
American ideals of hard work and integrir
ty. One leaf is just enough I think. You
don’t want to clutter things up with boo
many leaves, you know.

I decline the offer a bit hastily. ”no, no
thanks,” ,

Later in the afternoon it turns hot. AS I
work, the beads of sweat on the back of my
neck feel like ﬂiey’re sizzling in the sun.
Already I hate this job. I hate ”’16 whole
business of pounding long, skinny nails in»
to dense, knotty wooden fence posts. I hate
the constant buzz of flies. I hate the sight of
cattle complacently waddle-shuffle-
clopping from the water bin to the feed
box. 1 hate one way they chew and nuzzle
each other, I hate the sound of them
urinating among themselves. on each
other.

But sheeit, the thing I really, rcally hate
is the pervading stench. ot manure,

I work on — cursing a little, slapping in—
sects a lot. viciously hammering with
unplacated fury . . . and pause. I wipe the
wet from my brow, finish the section oi
fence, collect the tools. and climb over into
the next corral. I stride off across the open
space toward the opposite fence. the
bucket full of tools rhythmically banging
against my calf. A movement catches my
attention. My gaze. swings and my jaw
drops involuntarily. The biggest steer I've
ever seen in my life stands solid and for
midable in the corner at the corral,

Looking at me.

Gauge distance-long waylcss between
him and me than me and fence-biglord on~
ly knows how many hands high-almost as
tall as me-never make itrgoing to die-going
to die-going to die wihtout workman‘s come
pensation . . .

t' My brain feverishly evaluates the situar
ion,

» Heart failure, or close to it.

I set the bucket down slowly (oh so slow-
ly. now!) and try to edge away, Run?
Sneak? Pick up a clod and hurl it at him?

Run, YES! Legs in uncontrolled motion.
I lose my balance, spinning . . . and fall
hard on my pride. A quick glance and
grimace at my sticky, manure-coated
hands coniirms my disgustand with that, I
scramble away on all fours. Almost there,
now! With my belly down in the muck, I
Slither under the fence to safety and. turn
back to see the progress of my pursuer.

The black Steer stands in the Same spot,
watching me curiously.

.Mr. Rugers inspects my manured condi-
tion with an eyebrow raised in question.
“Well . . .," he finally says, “I don’t reckon
you’ll be comin' to work tomorrow
ﬂien,huh?"

”Oh, yes. I'll be back! " I reply, 3 bit too
vehemently,

I bounce into the driver's Seat, start up
the Beast, and tear off down the country
road, homeward bound. Oh, yeah: I’ll be
back, alright-with gloves, my old boots,
and if I can dig it out of the back of grand
pa's old tool shed, .

A cattle prod,

Besides, everyone knows we need a new
logo to attract more new students. One
potential new student I showed the new
logo to said, “Gosh, I’d never go to a col~
lege that had four leaves as its logo, but
now . . . now that there’s one leaf, I’m gon-
na mail for my application tomorrow._”

Students here just don‘t relaize the "11*
portance of attracting as many students as
humanly possible. HOW else could we
maintain the overcrowding of the dorms?
Besides, with more students applying we
can be assured that many more fine
students across this great land of ours can
be turned down for admission.

So to you cynics and humbugs, 1 say hur- ‘
rah for the new logo. Perhaps. we should I
get a new logo every year. We could all
wait with anticipation for each new logo
like little children on Christmas morning.
With love and good cheer,

Ken Rose

Quiet
as a
Mouse

By Michael .I. Munley

One thin we seem to be constantly con
cerned wi here at Grinnell College is (in-
ding an interrelationship among authors,
artists, theories, absu‘actions . . . the list
goes on and on. I don't know about most of
you, but I’ll go on record to admit uiat my
own searches for inter-relationships often
end up as very intense, time consuming
struggles,

I’ve notices, however, that when I space
things off, my brain has no trouble tinding
it‘s own interrelationships between all
sorts of twisted and seemingly unrelated
thoughts . , .

Figs are nice animals. I think someone
once told me, contrary to popular belief,
that they are actually very clean animals.
Still, I have my doubts because pigs do
spend a lot of time in a pen which is
typicall very dusty or very muddy. i
remem r going to a football game during
my freshman year and seeing pigs grazing
in a post-harvest corn tield.

What a day mat was. It seemed like you
could see forever — I could truly ap
preciate the lyrics “0h beautiful for
spacious skies and amber wava of grain .
. .” from “America the Beautiful.”

That reminds me: everytime I cross
Eighth Avenue between North and South
Campus I lookato the east and feel like I’m
close to the ocean. I’m so used to roads at
the beach ending at the horizon that I still
have trouble putting a corn field at the end
of Eighth Avenue. Being on a beach is cer~
tainly something I’ll nevr grow tired of.

“On the Beach,” filmed in 1958, remains
to oils day one of the most poweriul movies
that I've ever seen in terms of the state
ment it makes about nuclear war. I find it
especially amazing that the movie was
made almost thirty years ago, but remains
to this day both very timely and very
realistic.

I saw “On the Beach” when I was a
sophomore in high school It's fantastic to
consider the breadth of experiences I’ve
had since then. Life after college seemed
too futuristic to ever become a reality;
now I‘m within one semester of making
that future a reality. It's funny how my
perception at things has changed.

My father is a high school teacher and
coach and {can remember going with him
to various games and practices when I was
very little a particularly iootball games
when I was in the third grade I'll never
forget how small I felt, wondering if I’d
ever be big enough to ever play high school
football.

Dear Editor,

“My god, we spent $40,000 on a new
logo??? And it‘s UrGrerll It’s just
tasteless and does not resemble a corn»
stalk anymore.” Not only Laurie Dunivant
was shocked when she saw the headline of
the first ShB edition this. “Think of all the
things we could have done with $40,000!”

— tunetune the piano in Loose

— bribe Governor Branstad to keep the
pub open

7 esthetically redesign the Darby park»
ing lot

7 start off David Day in Grad school

7 finance a Grinnell Singers tour to
W-Germany

— invest in lap computers

7 expand Grinnell’s overseas and in-
ternship programs

— renovate some OCH

— add another faculty member

— give another scholarship to a (South)
African student . . .

What’s,
it Called

By Barbara Brown
In the wee hours of August 27, while en
route to Des Moines’ magnificent excuse
for an airport, I was seated next to a
woman. She happend to he a very talkative
woman and let slip that she lived in Mar-
shalltown. Not wishing to appear as unr
friendly as I was feeling on my delayed-
for-twelve~hours flight, i forced myself to
submit to smalltalking with this woman. I
recalled that she lived in Marshalltown.

“Oh,” I said, assuming a pleasant voice,
“I go to school at Grinnell.”

“Oh," she asserted, “so you go to Grins
nell High School." AS people often mistake
me for a seventh-grader, this remark flats
tered me. Nevertheless, I felt obliged to
correct her. Only then did I realize the true
problem

“No," I said, “this will be my second
year of colleg

“There’s a college in Grinnell?" queried
the woman.

“Yes.“

“What’s it called?”

“Grinnell.

“Oh. I didn’t think Grinnell was big
enough to have a college."

This conversation was saved from fur
ther demise by the stewardess, who
rcsea ted my talkative friend elsewhere.
It again was safe for me to assume my
usually unpleasant disposition.

Perhaps I am alone in diis sentiment,
but I always have found Grinnell’s identity
(or lack thereof). to be one of its most at
tractive features. It is fun to attend a col»
lege of which most people never have
heard, I have suspected that there must be
something inherent in the name
“Grinnell” which allows people to forget
It, ignore it. or remember it as being in
Ohio.

1 also always have thought that the peo-
ple who pull strings here recognized that
part of Grinnell’s charm lay in its
anonymity and that they worked,
therefore, to preserve it. I irequently have
enjoyed fantasies oi George Drake, sitting
in his office, making a concerted effort to
keep Grinnell littlerknown, Events, as I
have imagined them, started to change a
few years ago when George Drake was
prevented from making an important
phone call to U.S. News and World Report.

“Hey guys,” I have imagined he had
planned to say, “George here again. Do
me another favor, will you? Make Sure to
keep Grinnell’s name off your “Ten Best
Colleges” list. We have a reputation to
keep up, you know. Thanks a bunch."

But of course, the phone call I imagined
never to have been placed never was. The
result was that Grinnell was written up in

.On Friday, September 5th, in the
academic atmosphere of Science 172, John
Young, the developer ot the new logo, ate
tempted to explain uie process for which
he usually receives a 5 digit salary, Not
surprisingly he impressed the coffeerand-
cookiertranquilized audience with his
perfectly-designed slideshow. In the end
everything sounded reasonable, — that is,
I could imagine where the money went but
I still couldn’t figure out why the Grinnell
arLs department couldn't have done the
$40,000 job (of cutting the old symbol in
quarters) equally well, Just as another
student said that day, “did the ends justify
the means in this case?” .

Of course there are always two sides to
every coin, and there are other student
voices to be heard like Jian Chen-Yu from
China who simply said $40,000 is nothing
compared with 100 million." However. I
have some doubts if Beto Cunningham
rould agree with this type oi Chinese
