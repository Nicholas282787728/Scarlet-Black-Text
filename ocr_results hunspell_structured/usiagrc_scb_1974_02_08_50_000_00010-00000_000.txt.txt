was havmg an energy crisis, it
seemed that nothing could go right.
or the 20 players expected, 10
showed up.

Things appear to be looking up
Somewhat better now. Captain/
Coach/Organizer Al Frey is en-
couraged by the ability of several
prospective players and is looking
for about 15 to come out this week,
He thinks he may have filled the
vacuum lelt by Mike Levy's grad-
uation zit goalie with Mali Heine,
and a game has been tentatively
scheduled for March 2 against Gr-
aceland in Des Moines. Other schr
nols with which games will probe
ably be played are Creighton, Dore
dt, Drake, and University or Nebr
raska.

The “basic problem,” according
to Frey, "is money.” Each time
the squad travels to Des Memes to
play in Capitol Ice Arena, where
the Graceland contest will be plays
ed, the squad must come up with
$20 plus transportation expenses.
The College has done virtually nor
thing to support its ice hockey
team, A few years back a set of
hockey shorts were purchased {or
the team, as was some or the goals
ie equipment As far as helping
to pay the rental Costs lor the
Ice Arena, there has been no ac
tion on the part of the College.
Despite lack of equipment, College,
and student body supphrt, the ice
hockey team is determined to play;
and will.

Coe was just too much. Monday
night the Pioneers came up with
one of their finest performances
ol the season, led by an incredible
22-point first half from Dennis
Moos, only to he trounced hy laop’s
fronts running Kohawks. Coe had hes
aten Grinnell Friday night at Cedar
Rapids 105-68. Grinnell’s overall
won-lost record has now dipped to
3-7, while the Kohawks remain uri-
defeated in conference play.

Although Coe never lost the lead
after moving out to a quick 872
advantage early in the game, their
first half margin‘was never over-
whelming. Moss, Paul Delaney, and
Chip Hall combined to tally as of
the squad's 40 first half points,
while a tenacious defense and sur»
prisingly strong rebounding held the
Kohawk offensive machine to 40
markers.

Coe controlled the second half tip-
off and quickly increased their ad-
vantage, pushing the lead to
16 points. One seond stanza rally,
led by Rick williams, who scored
16 in the hall, brought Grinnell to
within 9, but no more. In the final
minutes Coe substituted freely, e57
pecially alter the Grinnell starters
began to leave the line-up. The last
minute saw second and third team-
ers from both sides shooting wild-
ly to get into the books. CraigZippe
got in,

For Grmnell, Mossnetted27,willr
iams 18, Delaney 16, and Hall 10.
High-scoring regular Bill Bailey,
who had started every previous
game, was out of town. Ed McFalls,
returning Kohawk senior Selected
last year as an all—conferenceforr
ward, led all Kohawk scorers with
15.

The squad is on its way this after-7
noon to University of Chicago for
an evening contest, followed by a
Saturday night game with Cornell
at Mt. Vernon, la. The next home
game will be Saturday, February
16, against Cornell in Darby Gym-
nasium. The 7:30 PM. encounter
will be' the first of a four—game
home stand that will bring in Cor-
neu, Beloit, Monmouth, and Knox.
