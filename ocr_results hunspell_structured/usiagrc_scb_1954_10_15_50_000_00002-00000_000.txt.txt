T0 .TI-IE EDITOR:

Normally when campus issues
arise preps are expected to re—
main. silent because or: lack of
experience in the customs of
the college. .At present, how-

ever, a controversy is raging on

campus that freshmen have
had a very recent experience
with and thus are well quallr
tied to express an opinion
upon. That subject is prepping.
Everyone seems to be entitled
to an opinion and everyone
seems to be expressing that
opinion except those students
who have just undergone prepe
ping activities. This letter is an
attempt to express the opinion

of a segment of this group, a

segment which has been found

to he chute large.
In an earlier issue of the 5&3

a survey was published telling

that most of the students in

Cowles hall were happy that

they had no prepping. The er-

ror in this survey was that the
preps questioned had never exa
perienced prepping and thus

’didn’t know what they were

missing. Well, we‘ve been
. through prepping and we liked

it. This fact was born out in

Dibble hall in a survey taken

independently by freshmen for
.our own benefit, This survey

showed that an overwhelming
majority of the treshman men
in the hall, a majorityas great
as- that in the Cowles survey,
approved of prepping and
these were men who know what
prepping is. Paddles don‘t hurt
for long. Pajamas and other
costumes don’t hurt much
either. The fact of the matter
is that prepping does make
you better acquainted with
your ball, its residents, and its
customs; it does make you ape
preciate your position as an in
dividual and as a class; and
most important of all it pre—
serves an important campus

tradition, ,

We liked prepping; we
thought it was tun; and we
think that our prepmasters and
house councils have done a fair
job in administering it.

TO THE EDITOR

l’m avetcran in the freshman
class and wonder if 1 might put
my two cents in this prepping
business. So there will be no
misunderstanding, let me say at
the start I’m against prepping,
i see no reason why grown men
must be made to do menial
tasks.

The first year at school is, as
you know, the most important,
It is this year that you form
your opinions of the school and
your future friends. For many it
is the first time away rrom home
for such an extended stay. After
looking forward to being with
more intelligent people, can you
imagine the effect that being
“beat” with a “club" has on
some of these freshmen?

Personally, if ,I had to be on
the receiving end of this prepa
ping, i would recommend to
anyone who would listen that
they not attend this school.
What an advantage over other
schools if the notice that there
is no prepping whatsoever at
Grinnell. could be printed in the
catalog. No one likes to be hurt,
even for a little while.

D. A. Green
Cowles Hall
TO THE EDITOR:

The little men run around
in picture tubes, and the proper
Bostonians around here are
plumb horrified that any col.
lege literary magazine should
1) call itself by a name from
the wild and wooly West, and
2) be so utterly undignified as
to print by the Ditto process.

Out of concern and sympathy
for these pore people, we should
like to remark that (1) MAV-
ERICK is no more likely to
print bull than THE ATLAN-
Tlc MONTHLY is to print
bilgewater and (2) the import-
ance of a literary magazine is
usually considered to come from
what it says that is worth say.
ing, and not from saying it in
the right color of ink.

or course, if MAVERICK
really goes over and we find
ourselves with an amount of
cash on hand about equal to the
cost of printing six or seven
issues of the late ARENA
(which went broke paying com.
mercial printing bills, as did
TANAGER longer ago), we can
buy a Multilith duplicator and
a Vari-Typer, with which means
Grinnell’s own students can
print photographs, headlines,
four—color process. etc: but in
the meantime we operate on the
assumption that Grinnell slur
dents are mature enough to
care more about the quality
and quantity of the literary ma:
terial they read than about how
pretty it looks on the printed
pages.

We’re a little in the dark on
why MAVERICK is not consid-
ered as “fundamental" an idea
as the proposed SDXrSrEzB sup-
plement. Perhaps some people
would just rather see literary
matter printed on newsprint
paper (which soon yellows and
tears easily) than on Ditto par
per (which lasts for years).

Contrary to certain insinua—
tions, it isn‘l us. podnuh, who‘s
approaching this whole thing
with stopgap measures which
are merely the lamented corpse
of ARENA all dressed up and
perfUmed. We are in this lit-
erary business because we think
that we have an original, ate
tractive formula figured out
which will result in a magazine
too doggoned good to be called
a substitute for anything. So
we ask your support and en

SCARLET AND BLACK

OUT of

t,l.l‘.i.,He" 3°“ As Rural Siudenl

Now that prepping is almost
over, it might not be out of
place to say a few good words
about it. Everybody seems to
be going out of his way these
days to plan it completely,
cither out of a newefound al—
truism or some higheflown fecle
ing for moral uplifting, with
the idea that freshman sensir
tivities are being offended. In
some cases, the latter may be
valid. Not particularly around
here.

It's struck me that the only
really doubtful quality in the
local prepping program is the
custom of paddling. And not
because of the idea that it
might be degrading or physi—
cally harmful _ it usually
isn‘t _ but because the darned
things cost money,

Actually, it seems to me that
the only people the program
really harms are those who may

not be too healthy mentally in
the first place; and i trust not
many such people are admitted
to the college.

Those preps who accept it
willingly and keep their ton.

gues in check are, believe it

- or not (and this is a personal

opinion), pretty well adjusted
individuals; probably better
adjusted than those whose
flesh creeps at the sound of
wood striking posterior.

And those who rebel openly
but live through it receive the
greatest amount of benefit la-
ter on. They sometimes lose a
certain amount of arrogance
which they Won‘t regret having
lost.

Prepping isn’t an
part or college life, but it's
hardly evil or decadent
enough to be worth all the
uproar. (I’m proceeding on
the assumption that there is
a mild uproar being raised
here and there.) Besides, I
like to have a hamburger
about midnight.

Rumley says that the amus-
ing things the kiddies have to
do generally have no purpose.
That's true, possibly. Huxley
says (Rumley and Huxley both
being outstanding philosophers),
regarding a subject on a slight.
ly higher plane, that, while
purpose isn't necessary to hu-
man life, it can be imposed
there.

There isn’t necessarily a
purpose in believing in Santa
Claus, but he's nice to have
around. of course, there's
something to be said ror the
other side._ I could never see
much purpose in mosquitoes.

Tryouts Continue
For Two Operas

Tryouts wich began Wednes-
day for two short operas willcon—
tinue next Tuesday from 4:15 to
6:00 pm. in room 10 of themusic
building, Duane Crossley, (mus-
ic), announces. The operas will
be presented in January.

There are about ten soloists
as well as a small chorus involv-
ed in the operas, one or which
is “Impessario,” a comedy by
Mozart. The other opera will be
selected soon. “Auditions are
open to anyone at all interested,"
says Crossley. “I want to re-
hearsc a good while ahead to
avoid too many rehearsals a

Two Seniors Tell Of Experience

Jim Ameling, a 21 year old
senior, summed up his
pel‘ience as a student minls-
ter :15 “the realization of a
si year’s dream.” The culm-
illcltlon of the dream is a
little white church set in the
midst of Iowa cornfield: and
pastures about seven miles
from Grinnell lll Chester
township.

Jim, an English major, travels
daily to school, When not at-
tending classes, he is to he found
either at the Chester congregae
tional church or at the parson»
age in Sheridan which he shares
with another student minister,
Orlan Mitchell, and his family.

Ministers

“When I looked at things
and saw what a mess they
were ill, the church seemed
to me to be the only answer
to the world’s problems.
Tllztt’s the reason I‘m in the
ministry,” said Ol‘lall Mit-
chell, 21 year old senior and
student minister. , '

Most students know Mitch as
the night watchman and maint-
enance man. a job he gave up
last weck. He is now the stu-
dent minister of the Sheridan
township Methodist church, and
lives with his wife and child
and another student minister,
Jim Ameling in the parsonage
about 12 miles northeast of
Grinnell.,

”I always wanted a job like
this,” said Mitch. "Here I was
working 48 hours a week in the
heating plant, totally alienated
from what I wanted to do, when
this iob came up. The money
isn't so good but that’s not
what is important. I can spend
time with my family now, and

, l'i-n doing the Job I’ve always

Jim described the past sum-
mer which he spent as a full
time mi ister as “the most
wonderful three months of my
life." He added, “I was never
even on a farm until 1 got
this job. I lpve the outdoors
so you can imagine what it
means to me."

Jim attained his present posi-
tion by submitting his name to

the Congregational Conference
of Iowa, thinking he could fill
in Sunday morning pulpit va—
cancies when they occured. He
discovered that the church in
Chester needed a full time min—
ister, and after preaching there
once, he was chosen as the per-
manent pastor. Jim will con-
tinue ministering to the needs
of his congregation until he
graduates in June.

Is the job of a student
minister a lonely one? “No!"
says Jim. “The people took
me in like a son. They are
real friendly — the salt of the
earth. I com into contact
withinmily situations which
provide a contrast to college.
It enriches and enhances your
understanding of people. And
I like having time to mysell
to read and think things out.

Besides, Jim’s job is a busy
one. His congregation is com-
posed of about 100 people, about
