Coming out is not an easy “how-to" list

I don't call my mom very riftt: This year
on her birthday, she eat me an email that
sarcastically 'iid, lliaiiks for the birthday
wisllcs'", which 1 promptly pietentled 1 hadn't
read as 1 called her to wish her .i happy bittlir
day. our conversations always run along the
same lines, usually ending with he. asking,
"Do you linvc any

other llC\vs,' U, ' '5 ‘
ally, 1 say no and

hang up, but last ‘ *
spring 1 responded ~

I'd been snuggling g
with rlic issue of "

how to bring some—
thing up to her, and so 1 just said: “Well, i'in
dating someone," She made an cxprcsston of
happiness, and then 1 Suid,“But it’s a girl."

A brief, awkward silcncc followed, and,
not knowing how to break it or reassure her or
make the confession slightly better, I blurted
out, “But don’t worry, I’m not gay or anything."
A year later, I still hate that I did that. I hate
that I had to qualify my sexuality as some sort
ofphasc. Even to myself,1 had to say, “rm only
dating a girl because 1 haven’t found the right
boy." I've always been a pretty enthusiastic
gayrrights activist, and i never had any trouble
with the hypothetical idea ofbeing gay , that
is, until I thought that maybe 1 was.

This isn’t my usual column. I’m the first
to admit that I don’t write hardshirring, emo-

mink that the ,

cclebrrred list year with .i girliiiend and cel

along the lines of,

what it means. "Anti
even though 1 Vclicr
inciitly defended
myself and bisexu-
ality in geneiai,1 was seaied. 1 don‘t like being
in n statc of indecision. I like knowuig what 1
nm, and even though ‘bisexiial'itsclfit a sexual
label, I wish I could just decide [0 like one sex
more than the other,

This column is my real coming out - not
that 1 like girls and boys, but that 1 wish I
didn't, I wish 1 were gay or straight, something
that my parents could accept, something thatl
could wear as a definition and not feel uncomr
fortable with.

I don’t want this to be offensive, and I cer-
tainly don't want it to detract from Pride chk
or the fight to assert bisexuality as a solid, real
identity. 1 just know why people have such
trouble wrapping their heads around it. This
year and last year, 1 was in constant flux be-

nveen homo and heterosexuality, try ig to cs»

have to conic to relins with. I'm not sure why,
but it's a lot more compelling to me to say,
“I'm A lcsh‘inn" than to that I'm hiscailal,
even ll'tt'S not ti'uc Mwhe it's h ‘ l wasni

coinioirahie with the idea of polar opposites

Mayhc 1m inst hypothesizrng and I actually
have no idea.

I wish this week's column could be a “how
to" and that 1 could instruct blossoming bisex-
uals on how to come to tcrms with their new-
found identities. But the truth is,I wish SOKIIC‘
one had written a guide for me. This pridc
week,1 wore my Bifocal-piavidcd flag proudly
and I participated in the Day etSiience.

I try to accept that a let ofpcoplc are built
in shades of gray. And I'll take “how to" advice
from anyone who offers it 7 how to define my-
selfto parents who don't believe in bisexuality,
how to accept attraction in different forms,
how to be more open.

Because as sarcastic and conﬁdent and ﬁlm
ny as 1 try to be, life is a learning process, and
I've only had a year's practice in this. I simply
have to learn that realistically, my mom would
be awkward with any discussion of my sexualr
iry. The only person I really have to come out

 

 

‘ Letter of protest from the Multicultural House

Dear Grinncll Housing Committee:

On behaifofmany student groups on cam
pus, we wish to express our shock and outrage
at the denial of the Multicultural Manor’s
application tor project house renewal, Thc
committee's decision sends a strong negative
message to the campus multicultural comlnur
nity, displays a persistent trend ofinsrinitional
insensitivity to issues of diversity, and reveals
an unsettling scr ofprioritics.

We remain distressed by the presence of
Megan Gocring on the committee, who, as
PrcSidcnt ochbatc Club, did not excuse her-
self from the proceedings despite the obvious
conflict or interest. Debate Club applied for
and received a project house. This ﬂagrant
disregard for a fair hearing process further
diminishes oilr trust in a student government
already troubled by ethical controversies.

The Multicultural Manor, as Well as the
student groups represented within it, has
achieved extraordinary success this year, a sucr
ccss dependent on the physical resource of a
house. By gathering together 14 student actlvr
ists from multiple Campus organizations, the
Multicultural Mnnor fosters incrcascd collab-
oration and cultivates student lcadcrship This
past year, the Multicultural Manor:

_significantly incieased communication
bctween multicultural student groups,

~Organizcd last semester's extremely Sucr
cessful Drag Extravngn .a, an AIDS tund-
raising performance that attracted an audie
cncc otroughly 200 students and raised nearly
250 dollars in donations. The money was used
to provide free HIV/AIDS tests iii the Health
Center for Students during AIDS Awareness
Week,

rOpened the living room to HIV/AIDS
information sessions, run by the Health Cen-
rcr staff and held during AIDS Awareness
Week,

—0rganized this semesters even more
successful Drag Extravaganza to kick off
Pride Week, which attracted an audience of
almost 200 students, parents, and community

members. It raised nearly 300 dollars worth of
money that will be donated to Project Angel
Food, a Los Angelcs charity that provides dai»
ly nutritious meals to pcoplc who are hotne-
bound due [0 HIV/AIDS and othcr serious
illnesses.

—Is heading up the planning for a social
Justice symposium scheduled tor the second
halropriii,

71s producing a staged reading or Friar
in we Mirror, .i play that chronicles the 1991
Crown Heights, Brooklyn race riots,

rServcd as a meeting location for multiple
student organizations (CLPOC, CBS, SOL,
And others),

—Hc1pcd Gi'innell Multicultural Admis’
sions enormously by hosting large numbers of
multicultural prospective students,

rOpcnctl the kitchen to student organiza-
tions for cooking,

rl‘lostcd a Community Meal.

—Tu[ort:d local high school students.

—Opcncd the living room to the campus
community tor weckly viewing of popular
shows like Project Runway, thc L Word, etc,

rI-lostcd a Thanksgiving dcsscrt reception
open to the entire community.

—Hostcd sew ai themed movie nights
open to the entire community,

-Orgnnizcd the "LA. Nights" l-larris pare
ty open to the entire community,

rGave the administration an opportunity
to snppoit multicultural students, groups, and
communit' s.

Despite these enormous accomplishments,
the Housing Committee chose not to renew
the Multicultural Manor’s application for a
project housciscnding a message to the mule
t‘tcultural students who organized them that
their hard work would be neitiicr recognized
nor rewardedwc applaud the successes ofthe
Multicultural Manor this year, and condemn
the mcssage the Housing Committee has sent
to its student leaders.

We believe that multiculturalism means
not only many eulnircs but also many differ-

ent type: ofcultures: racial, national, sexual, soc
clarcconomic, religious, and ethnic (to name
a few). The Multicultural Manor tiiily rcpi‘er
seiits the Wide spectrum of diversity present
on this campus, In denying them a project
house, the Housing Committee does not deny
only onc student group a valuable resource; it
deities overt/airy.

in a campus environment wheic when
Concerned Black Students began theii pre-
sentation at last scln 'rcr’s Trustees Mcct-
ing to save the black Cultural Center irom
the threat of dcmolirion, two thuds of the
students at the Sl‘tilldlligTKOOm-Only meeting
walk out, where aTrustec describes the Multi-
cultural suites in the JRC as ifit were a ghet-
roia place whete multicultural students go to
“Speak their languages, play their music, and
eat their food", where the College has never
adequately replaced the original Stonewall
Resouice Center after bulldozing the Younker
Memorial Health Center in 2004, safe spaces
for multicultural students are few and {at be-
twccn.This year, the Multicultural Manor has
provided that space to the entire canipus comr
munity. We arc deeply saddened that nextycar.
the Housing Conimitrcc has chosen to declr
care that space to the nccds of Dag, Debate,
and Frisbee instead.

We protest the Housing Committee’s de-
nial of the Multiculniial Manor's application
foi project house renewal. We Will not be see
qucstclcd to thc tiny glass boxes ofthc hlultir
cultural Wing to “speak [our] languages, play
[our] music, and cut [our] food."Wc demand a
prominent and physical space whcre the entire
community is welcome and whcre multicul-
tural students feel safe. We demand our voice
be heard and recognized. We deserve it.

Sincerely»

The Multicultural Manor
