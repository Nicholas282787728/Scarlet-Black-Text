“WHAT HAPPENED TO
JONES" Is FEATURE
Well Known ThreyAct Farce To
Be Given In A. R. H. Audi»
barium March 17th.

The third ol- the series of all-college;
entertainments is to be given by the
freshmen m the A. R. H. auditorium
I" 13-, March lith at we o’clock.
Broadhurst's tamous three act farce
.. ‘ at Happened to Jones" is the vc-,
hicle comprising the evening's pi ~l
grain.

The play has to do with a traveling
salesman by the name of Jones, who
forces entrance into the living room
of Professor Goodly's home, after be-
ing chased by policemen following a
raid on a prohibited prize ﬁght. The
fact that his arrival is timed the same
as the expected arrival of the profes-
sor’s brother the Bishop of Ballarot
gives rise to many unexpected min»
plication. Jones assumes the role of
the bishop to avoid arrest and is "of )-
ed by circumstances to continue in
this role even after the arrival of the
real one. The manner in which he
smoothcs matters over to his own safe-
ty as well as the satisfaction of the
others involved is the source of much
amusement. Not content with decctv~
ing the Protessor he also makes ar-
dent love to his ward Cissy.

The leads are carried by Lucile Keir
ford and Gordon Johnston as Cissy'

, and Jones respectively. The others
in the cast are Dehrv Barton. Stuart
Ball, win. Wood, Carl Hobbett, John
Grimes, John MacAlpine, Ruth Hew-
ett, Helen Meta. Marion Elder, Kath—
arine Gilmore, and Samantha Jones.
Much work has been put upon the play'
and it is rumored that the Kennedy's
who witnessed a rehearsal when they
appeared in Grinnell several .veeksl
ago were very favorably impressed
with the Frosh's presentation. The
play is staged under the direction oi

' Robert Eaton. it real evening enter-i
tainment is guaranteed by the play
committee in charge, which is headed
by Wm. Wood

The entire college, students and,
faculty alike, are cordially invited to‘
attend and share in the st. Patricli‘
revels. Attention is called to the fact
that no seats are reservedeﬁrst come
first served. ‘

Facing Crisis-«Four Power

Edwin Munmgu, secretary of state
for India, has resigned at the request
of Lloyd George on the grounds that
he has violated the "collective respon—
sib ity of the cabinet to the hing and
to Parliament and has embarrassed the

and Italy which Turkish l’clil'esclltllr

Liberal and Conscivative wings of die
Coalition government and there' is
much feeling that Montagu has driv-
end the final nail in the coffin of the
Coalition govsr.nrnent The resigni»
tion of the Premier is expected be-
cause of his action. Montagu was one
of his Liberal colleagues in the cabi—
uet while Reading was his personal
appointee. He has deserted one on a
technicality and seems about to aban-
don the other. The appointment of
Derby would mean the swing of Lloyd
George from the side of his former
Liberal colleagues to that of the Con-
servative element and The Liberals
are not disposed to permit this with-
out a ﬁght.
Robinson Amendment Defeated
After a powerful attack on the four—

power treaty by the Republican “ir--

i-econcilables" under the leadership or
Senators Burah and Johnston the
senate arranged for a vote on the
Robinson amendment. This Vote which
was expected to furnish something of
a test. of strength on the four Dowel

of the party leaders are inclined to
resent criticisms ol the pill but only
Frcan of Wisconsin has attempted to
answer the criticisms. Fl'edl' wrote to

ments ztbuut the bonus measure, der

that the bonus bill would be reported'
front the full ways and means com.
niitlee and passed within a. week.
Slush iii-my bill

The housle appiopi-iatious commit-
tee havc so mercilessly slashed the
army bill that a dispute seems immlr
iient. The terms at the bill. now call
for a reduction at the army to 11 —
000 which is 35,000 below the mini-
mum which arniy experts say is es-
sential to maintain an cilioicut army
and an effective system of national
deience. The number of officers has
been reduced to 11,000 which is 1000
less than the numb/er asked by the war
department The appropriation for
purely military expenditures is $63,;
795,000 less than was asked for The
committee also proposes to diminish,
the number of troops now stationed
in China, on the Rhine, in Hawaii andi'
in Panama. It is this diminution of
foreign forces that is expected to
arouse the strongest opposition.

Ratify Versailles Treatyr

The allied reparations commission
has totally ignored the American
claim for $241,000,000 on German as.
sets to pay for the cost ot majntaim
ing the American- army of occupation
on the Rhine The commission is pro
ceeding to divide the German billion
gold mark payment without ieferonce
to the United States The Haiding
Tadrninistration is wiought up over
this action and will soon have some
forceful representations to make to
the allies Allied nations regaid this
Tsituation as hopeful for American iat
ification of the veisailles treaty.
