Sunday Concert.
1 The Sunday afternoon concert open-
cd with Beethoven's overture to Fide-
, liu, played by the Minneapolis Symph—
ony Orchestra under the direction of
Emil Oberhoffcl'. The enthusiam with
which the orchestra entered into the
overturc was a good omen, aiid it was
,fulﬁlled in the manner in which the
jmen, in spite or nearly seven weeks of
‘ traveling and playing, gave themselves
completely to every number on all the
programs. There was none of the lily
(inference that used to charactel'i.e
this orchestra. and the demeanor oi
the men was earnest, and appropriate
to the occasion.
The Schubert symphony, witll its

clearly outlined themes, and its smoo-
ltllly ﬂowing rythm, was the chief or-
lchestral number oi thc Sunday pro—
gram. It will be remembered by the
delicate phrasing of the woodwind in-
struments in their various solo parts,
the ﬁlite, .ir, Linden, the oboe, hir. liae
hate, and the clarinet, llir. Perrier, all
distinguishing themselves in this and
several other numbers. The sym-
mlolly was followed by a set of varia—
