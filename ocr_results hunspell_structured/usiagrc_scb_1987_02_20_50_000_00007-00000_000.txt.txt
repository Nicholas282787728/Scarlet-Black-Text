Letters

Draus lauded as new Royko

Dear Editor,

It seems that every newspaper these
days wants to get their hands on a “Mike
Roykoxﬁ

For the major circulars it‘s no problem.
All they have to do is use their immense
monetary resources to purchase rights to
the articles of the famous syndicated col-
umnist himself. With their purchase they
receive the insightful yet bitingly sarcastic
views of one who has simultaneously
angered and humored Chicagoans for
years.

For others, especially college
newspapers, it’s a little more diiiicult.
Since they don’t have enough funds to buy
Royko's photocopies, they have to settle on
someone who can at least mimic his style.
The Scarlet and Black, luckily enough.
need search no farther, for they have final-
ly found that someone in Paul Draus. ,

Draus‘ “View from the Outside" column

‘ definitely follows in the Royko vein. His
commentaries are full of straight-faced
sarcasm intended to “tickle the funny
bone“ of mose whom he's not poking fun
and viciously anger those whom he is--a
fundamental trademark of Mike Royko.

Take his article on “forum people” from
two weeks ago, for example. His intens
tionally Confused and naive attitude
toward the rituals of forum life remind me
of the way MR. attacks the lifesyles of his
favorite group of people, the yuppics.

Similarly, last week’s article on
homelusness uses a tactic that Royko has
been applying to his current attack on TV
religion. Just as Royko suggests we should
not send money to Oral Roberts to see if
God will really strike him down, Draus
suggests that everyone in society should
drop out of it and let the poor and homeless
take tlleir place to see if the situation will
really improve.

Already, then, Draus shows that he has
perfected the “Royko” style to an art. He
Should feel proud that he can give the S and
B their “Royko” at a substantially reduc-
ed cost, and Mr. Royko himself should feel
a twinge of satisfaction that his writings
have opened up a field for writers who may
otherwise find no market for their breed of
expression. But of course both of them are
probably too sarcastic to admlt these feels
ings openly-Rich Blegen

Students organize against homelessness

Dear Editor.

Students Against the Injustices of
Homelessness is a new student organiza-
tion that is working to help the homeless in
Des Moines. Thls group travels to Des
Moines every Saturday to work at Kindred
House. Rufus House, and Catholic Workers
House, all homeless shelters in Des
Moines. Organizational meetings are held
every Tuesday in the Coffee House at 4:15.

This group was started by Grinnell stu-
dent David Lowenstein after the week-long
symposium on poverty and homelessness.
Through much effort, he contacted the
workers at Kindred House and Rufus
House as well as members of the Des
Moines city council to find out whether
there was any way the students of Grinnell
Could help Des Moines' homeless. About 50
people attended the first organizational
meeting of Students Against the Injustices
of Homelessness and signed up to help out
bad] at the shelters in Des Moines and here
on campus.

Last Saturday, about 20 students went to
Des Moines and spent the day working at
Kindred House, Rufus House, and the
Catholic Workers House, The work they
did consisted of painting, wallpapering,

cleaning, general repairs, and office work.
They were given a brief workshop and tour
of the houses, and they had the chance to
tall-I with and ask questions of the workers
there.

T '5 Saturday, die group is planning on
petitioning in Des Moines and encourages
anyone interested to come out and help.
There will be signs up around campus tell-
ing at what time on Saturday we will be
leaving. We plan to get back to Grinnell
around 5 pm,

If you are interested in helping out but
cannot make it to Des Moines on Satur-
days, there is plenty of work available
here in Grinnell. Volunteers are needed for
writing letters, making phone calls, and
helping to collect clothing, among other
things. To find out more, you could go to
the meetings on Tuesday (at 4:15 in the
Coffee House), or you could Contact David
Lowenstein or Laurie Dunivant.

Once again, we will be leaving for Des
Moines around 11 am. on Saturday (look
for signs posted around campus). You do
not need to have gone to any of die
meetings to go. Everyone interested in
helping out is encouraged to
attend-Karen Lehman

On Buddhism

by Jim Gilchrist

The Buddhism explained to me on a
street in St. Paul by two young men sound—
ed out of the ordinary. This Buddhism not
only promised to strengthen my life force
and erase my negative karma, but also
would allow me to pursue my goals and
desires with a positive condition which
would insure my succlss, for once you
have chanted (Nam Myoho Renge Kyo)
you will slowly come in tune with the law of
all life. This Buddhism didn’t promise to
erase your desires and problems, but pros
mised to enable you to overcome the pro-
blems and attain your goals. That is, if you
chanted correctly.

Two weeks later I received a phone call
and I planned to go to my first meeting. I
'was picked up by one oi the two whom I
had already met. He was more interested
in his new car than anything else: he asked
me if I liked it, told me about some of its
features, smiled liberally, and all in all
sounded, and looked, very happy about it. I
thought it was nice but didn't really care so
much about his car. However, I did begin
to wonder how he had got it. Deciding to
enter the militant stage of my Buddhism,
as well as being obnoxious from the start, I
asked snidely, but somehow innocently,
“How did you get it? Chant for it?"

“Yes."

He was now smiling even more than
before, and i felt even more ridiculous
than before. I left the militant stage and
entered the what in the world is this stage.
“So how did you actually get it?”

“I got a loan from the bank.”

“Uh huh — but you chanted for it?"

“I never would have gotten the loan if I

hadn't chanted."

“Uh huh."

At the meeting I was the only non-
Buddhist out of seven. They opened the
meeting by facing the altar, chanting from
a small book, and rubbing beads in their
palms. Listening peripherally to their
opening chanting, I looked again at the
pamphlet they gave me which began to ex-
plain their practice. On the back Patrick
Duffy and other luminaries were quoted in
the usual propagandist mode: “I never
could have gotten where I am today
without. . . ” and “I owe everything to . . .

During the meeting I was told by each of
the other six what Buddhism had meant to
their lives. Some had been chanting for
years, the most was twelve, and others for
months. Without fail they praised the ef-
fect on their lives: better jobs, better fami-
ly relations, and better living conditions
could all be traced back to the time they
began to chant. One woman introduced
herself and said, “I've been chanting for
twelve years and I wouldn’t stop for
anything.” A man later told me that he
chanted for two hours in the morning and
as much as possible later, “The more you
chant the greater the benefits,"
“Benefits," their favorite word.

So I gave the practice a try. For two
weeks I did it right. For a month I did it ir—
regularly. For two months it became non
existent, but caused much more trouble
than nonexistence should. Finally I out
the accoutrements away, the little book,
the little altar, the beads, and gave up, It
just wasn‘t for me.

View from the Throne

by Ted Amann

As you might well imagine, I was quite
honored to he voted King for Life of SGA
last week Iwould like to thank my friends
in SGA for their gesture. (Although I think
money would have been more practical.)

. As I understand it, this new title of mine

carries no power, no duties, and no com»
pensation. I’m not sure yet whether I’ll be
able to put it in my resume. (YOU try get-
ting an appointment with Career Develop
mentl) But I Can’t just Sit back and do
nothing. I figure it is my responsibility to
remain one of the college's outspoken ad-
vocates of an open, exciting. stimulating,
and expressive soclal life here at Grinnell.

These are years of big changes. in two
more years, the people who graduated two
years ago will hardly recognize the place,
New buildings, new grading. new phones,
new classes, and new rules will have a
great impact on the face of campus life.
These changes are inevitable. They are
either here already or just around ﬂ’le cor-
ner.

There is, however, another kind of
change-3 change not so much in the
physical manifestations and peripherals of
campus life as in the minds and attitudes
of the campus livers. The Grinnell that I
first met and fell in love wiﬂT in the first
half of this decade was full of students with
a lost for learning. plus something else.
They also had the idea that not all learning
came from a book or a lecture. Somebody
famous once said (or should have said, at
any rate), ”Experience is the best educa-
tion." This is not a new idea for most of
us; we know people who went straight to
professional Schools or into careers. But
not as many people stop to think what
meaning this little morsel has to tile
students of the liberal arts, How does one
learn the liberal arts through experience?

The answer I will offer sounds rather
wornrout these days,

I must admit. ’

However, I believe it still has its literal
meaning. beyond the hollow words we've
heard again and again. “Keep an open
mind." By this I do NOT mean “Impeach
Reagan," or “Ban Atomic Energy," or
anything like that. I simply mean that we
should not be too hasty to judge uie world
around us. Too often Isee people‘s actions
and opinions invoke the persecution of
their peers, or, even worse, oi total
strangers.

It seems that as the campus has gotten
simultaneously larger and more com-
petitive, and now that the new drinking
law has forced a change in social patterns,
it has gotten easier for people to slip into a
self-absorbed negativism: a View of the
world that holds the Self and one's goal as
the center of the world, and if you are not
helping, then you are necessarily hinder-
ing, A tricklingsdown of corporate “dog-
eat—dog" into college life. But with this
mentality we refuse to experience so much
of the world! Keeping an open mind not on-
ly allows each of us to be a freely express
ed individual. but also recognizes that we
canlearn so much about the world from_
one another.

“0.K., Ted, but what’s the int?H The
point. Well, I'm not sure myse f anymore.
Iguess what I'm saying is thatif we looked
more at what we have in common instead
of identifying by our differences, maybe
we could recover some of the feeling of
communality so many upperclassspeople
feel we’ve lost, College is a time to get
together with other people, If we're,all
worried about who's gay, who’s a geek.
who's a jock, who smokes pot. etc., we're
never going to get together and see what
we each have to offer. Grinnellians should
work hard, play hard, and stick together. I
think we'd all be a lot more Content if we
did,
