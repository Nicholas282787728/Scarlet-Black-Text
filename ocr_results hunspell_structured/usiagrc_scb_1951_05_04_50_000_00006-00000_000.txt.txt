,ior.

If Grinnell women don't like
the food being served in the
quad, they have the opportunity
of cooking their own in class—
at no extra charge. Besides, an
electrified kitchen, complete
with dishwasher and garbage
disposal, is available for class
room use in Main basement.

Miss Anna Williams, Read
hoiiseinother, teaches a home
management course to fourteen
girls each semester. The class
is divided into two sections
which meet each week on Tues.
day and Wednesday afternoons.

According to Miss Williams,

’most of the girls are juniors or

seniors, although upper class
standing isn't required. The
home management course is un—
der the euthenics program at
Griwlell.

The class is concerned pri—
marily with meal planning and
preparation. Perhaps the big
gest attraction of the course is
that the girls get to eat their
own cooking.

Besides learning to cook, the
girls get other household hints
trom Miss Williams. And most
