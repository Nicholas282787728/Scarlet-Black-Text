as Iowa. The Hawkeyes
made hilt 136 yards to Gl'innell‘s 312
yards.

“Mike” Augustine and Captain Bar-
rett together gained as much as the
entire old gold squad. “Mike" advanc-
ed the ball 124 yards and "Brat" cal--
list] it for sixty-three.

The scarlet and black squad made
tell fi"t downs. one more than the
Hall‘licyes made.

The lottll penalties were extremely
small constricting the fiercertess of the
antagonism. Iowa lost a total or
eighteen yards and Grinllcll suireretl
only a 3 Yard setback.

ments ol the game except in pllnting.
Laun's puutlllg was directly reslmlr
sible for Iowa's licld goal in the filst

Laun used their weight to much ad-
vantage.

“Fuzz” Watt received a "charlie
horse” in the game which was un-
noticed until Saturday night. It is
thought that one or his blood vessels
has become clogged. From his present
condition it is doubtful Whether he
will get. to play against Coe, a week
