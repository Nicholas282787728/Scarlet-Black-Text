OPEN DOOR POLICY.

Grinnell does not believe in the open door policy,
at least she has not entirely convinced herself whether
or no she should accept such a'policy. she is undecided,
and while she is in a state of doubt, the college goes about
its business in turmoil and confusion, and a general cun-
gestion slows things up considerably.

But wily should not Grinnell college adopt the wide
open door policy? The expense would be nothing and
if it did prove too burdensme, provision coilld be made
for it. in the Pioneer Chest. Perhaps the extra amount
of labor necessary makes it impossible, but then, there
are freshmen on the campus who are always ready and

 

willing to do a, daily good turn. No, these are obviously
not the reasons for a half Closed door policy, and we
would like to know what the reasons really r C.

0n the Griunell campus there are twentyriour spam
ious double doors which are always only half open. Sel-
dom would it be necessary to have all the double doors
in the quad upon, with the exception 01 the rout floor,
where there is usually a jinn on Fl’iilily and Sniuldn)‘
nights immediately before closing time. This half closed
door policy causes much contusion in tlic hilllr' of llle
R. H. and those leading to the library, at chapel time and
between the change 0i classes. Still more tllSOltli‘l‘ r: ’l'
he found (it the entrance of the Men's dining room at
meal time. '

Why does not Grinnell adopt the open door policy?
She hils the doors, which are becoming rusty from llir‘
lack of use, and hindering progress. Is it another tri’"
dition?

DANCE AND DATE RULES.

During the past week, the students of Oklahoma Uni-
versity held a good humored revolt, which followed the
publication of the university rules. The rules which
stirred up the turmoil were those governing dating, the
use of automobiles and dancing. The first demand of the
students was that dates should be allowed any evening
in the week and all day Sunday, and that dancing be per-
mitted until midnight on Friday and Saturday night.

After several mass meetings and conferences, the
student committee appointed to confer with the adminis
trative council finally revised their requests so that the
latest demands of the committee include a mod 'cation of
the present date rules, permitting seniors and juniors to
have dates up all Week nights until 10:20 p m . and sopho~
mores until 10:30 on Wednesday nights, and all students
until 12:30 a. m. on weekend nights. The present rule
allows only four dates a week to all students.

The Grinnell date rules are more satisfactory than
those of Oklahoma university. The hours are not as loin;
but freshmen and sophomore men have the privilege of
dating ‘every night of the week, although the freshmen
women are allowed only three dates ‘a week. In regard
to Sunday dates, if the students of Oklahoma universili
were permitted to have dates all day Sunday as well as
the use of cars over the weekend, the Univ
be too libcrul, Grilmell, however, could modify her pres-

ent rule and allow dating on Sunday afternoons as wr» l‘

as church and vespcr‘ dates; a modification which would
break one of the Grinncll traditions, but which would nn’
seriously effect the morals of the school, and ml-ybt lm
the beginning of a new tradition.

Western Conquest Is
Good for China—Wang

(Continued from Fage 1).

Wang called the Duh regime, a chaotic
state existed. The emperor during
the past regime had given the sover-
eignty of the provinces to his rela-
tives. The system of vassalage closely
resembled the modification of the
feudal system employed by William of
Normandy in his conquest of Brimih.
The dynasty was a lung one and when
the emporer at last toppled, or was
about to topple, he found that his vas-
. scls had changed during the genera.
tions between his reign and that of
the founder of the dynasty from rels.

China was shaken

Confucius Ito 1'.

It was during this timc,that Con-
fucius lived. This man, whom we
western minded ones give credit for
founding a system of philosophy which
gives its adherents so much stoic
placidity, was a more reviser who nape
pened along at the right time and re-
wrote the ancient classics in such a
way as to please the newly onihroned
emperor.

The doctrines which we attribute to
Confucious require absolute acqui-
escence ot the individual to higher
authority. This htted well with the
plans of the new emperor and he de<
creed that they be followed.

As the ages passed, the bending of
individuality to conformity grew and
affected the educational system. The
Chinese schools of the past few gen-
eratlons have been merely lurthelu
ances for this doctrine of the "divine
right" of“ power.

,Untll but a few years ago, the
Chinese student was required to learn
verbatim every book he studied. After
he had learned seve'ral books he would

- be initiated into the meaning of what

he had learned by his teacher, then
he Lwonld begin to \Write essays about
what ,he had learned. Conformity
was here the keynote. How the am
cients or pseudOcaneients who maln~
tain that there is nothing new would
have approved of this expressing of
the same old ideas in the same old
ways! The subjects of the essays
had to he found in the memorized
books.

Past Glorified.
.‘.Examinations were held each year
at the capital of the provlnce. Cone
formlty, the gloriﬁcation of the past
both were criteria in these tests. Ace
curacy was the one essential. Neat-
uess to the point of being painful was
required. These examinations con-
sisted ‘0! writing essays in the old,
old style ordained by Confucius.

Every three years more advanced
e‘ minations were held and the men
whOvcon'formed to the greatest degree
in these became the officials. How
Plato would have reveled in this ideal
state where brilliancy was awarded
with office!

Mr. Wang spoke of the different
classes in China. but with meticulous
care he assured me that they were not
castes BB in India. There are four
classesofficial, merchant, farmer, mid

‘s

laborer. A man may lift himst‘lV :l'l '
his class by the tri-i'tnnuai exmmnnr
tions to the rank of an ollicial.

With hopes of having a romantic
urge satisﬁed I asked about the ma .
darins, expecting of course a comic
opera rendition of the glamorous court
life. I was shaken when Mr. \Vang
courteollsly but emphatically informed
me that mandarin was the official lan-
guage of China, and not at heavily
padded, satin—kimonoerl individual who
would cut off his beloved daughter's
head rather than have her marry a
foreigner.

Early Governiout Centralized.

Another question was necessary to
learn the details of the government
before the Western influx. ’i'll'
romantic inkling was again sent back
ing when, from Mr, Wang's detailed
analysis, I learned that the Chinese
government of this early time was as
highly centralized as the modern
French government

In speaking briefly of the present
chaos in China, Mr. Wang said that
one must remember that China is hav-
ing her industrial, religious, social. p0~
litlcal and what have you revolutions

on the long periods required for the
European and American countries to
become accustomed to new instltnr
tions.

As he was leaving, Mr, Wang told
