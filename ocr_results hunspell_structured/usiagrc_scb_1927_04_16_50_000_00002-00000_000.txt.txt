EDI‘CATIO ' CURSE.

Is education a curse? Grinnell and Harvard will de-
bate on this subject soon. Meanwhile vivid and startling
posters have been placed about to arouse the attention
of it possible audience.

The subject should be interesting at least. It is sup
pased that some of the students have come here in search
of an education. There are always uiidcsirathles, the less
serious. They have come for varied reasons, not the
least of which is fun. But their presence should not
disturb the earnest few. Surely the college is big enough
for both.

However, it would be wise tor those earnest few to
consider the question. Will their studious endeavor be
worth the price they pay? When we look at some ot the
examples of the scholar that come before us now and
then, we feel that the smaller has a right to scoff. Taken
by itself, education will and does dry up the rich blood
of life. The mind is fed and fattened; the heart is lean

and starred. \nirh college years are out. there is lettl

The government recently cancelled a treaty with
Mexico and refused to prohibit the smuggling of arms in-
to that country, thereby unotlicially sanctioning an up-
rising within its hound, all because President Calles and
his collegiies refused to protect certain American proper—
ty interests in Mexico. American guns recently fired on
Soconoy Hill near Nallkillg, a certain city oi f:hin.;

Tomorrow Gi'ilinell college students anti students of
other colleges may he spending their lites that “Alilel'icall

can Ilnnnclei's, who already have too much money, may
gather more wealth, so that stockholders in concerns

“Old stufl," you say, and “Leave all that to politicians
and statesmen, what has it to do with me?" All too little
is being thought and even less is being said and done at
the present time about the formulation of a definite pur-
pose in this regard, especially in university mid collegiate
circles, where exists Everett Dean iiarlin says, “Alllerls
ca's only leisure class " At least we need not to remain
indifferent to the soon that so directly concern us, but
use our leisure to think the thing through.

There is some doubt as to what the future will bring
in foreign relations but there is no question as to what
the thinking people of ”America's only leisure class" will
do when Washington calls upon the college men to pull
the chestnuts out of the fire so that wall Street may sit
hack upon its haunches and eat, Whether or no we {is
nally n the Big Parade when the drums roll and crowd
chceis, we will not be ignorant of the real issue at stake.

it has been definitely decided that
Gl'inneil shall not enter the University
Theatre contest which will be held in
Chicago, April 21-23. “The Valiant,“
which was prepared for pi-escntatioii‘
had to be rejected, due to an error ou‘
the part of Northwestern university.1
and it was then too late to prepare‘
another play. 3

An attempt was made to arrangcf
matters so that Grinnell could proceed
with "The Valiant,” but this did not
meet with success.
