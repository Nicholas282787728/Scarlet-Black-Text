Women's Soccer at 4-1

by Jason Wolf

The Women's Soccer team
lost their ﬁrst game of ttte season
againstWashirtgton University ofSt.
Louis. "Basically, it came down to a
90 minute battle of wills, I felt that
Washington US physical presence,
especially at midﬁeld and the offenr
sive end, was the determining factor
in the match," he said Coach Ted
Eskildscn.

The Pioneers opened the
scoring early in the gamewhen Guen
Gifford scored offof a penalty kick.
Grinnell jumped out to a 2-0 lead
later in the period when Anya
Schwartz scored an unassisted goal
right in front of the Washington
keeper.

TheBears foughtbackto tie
the game by scoring off of a comer
kick and an indirect kick. Then, with
3:20 left in the game a Washington
University forward blasted a perfect

shot into the upper righthand comer
of the net for the final 32 score.

“I was very proud of our
effort, butalso veryconcerned about
our technique and our system,” com-
mented Eskildscn. The fact that
Washington played such a physical
game provcnted the Pioneers from
adhering to their game plan. “We
have to boable to execute what we're
trying to do,” concluded Eskildsen,
who was glad that his team was able
to measure itself against a regionally
ranked school. “That’s the only way
you get better — by testing your
boundaries"

With thedefeat the Pioneers
fail to 4-1 on the season while the
Bears are 74H. This week Grinnell
has two conference matchups, at
Cornell on Wednesday and at home
against Knox on Saturday. “These
games should provide us with tlte
opportunity to get back on track,”
said Eskildsen.

Men's X-(ountry wins, runs for Iowa title

The Men’s Cross Country
runners proved how they can per-
form when they are in top form by
winning the Beloit Invitational last
weekend. They edged Wheaton, 59-
68, while Rose Hulrnan was third
with 109 points. Coach Will Froc-
man commented, “The win was es-
pecially pleasing because our run-
ners went out slow and then picked
up pace. Who knows how well we
would have run if we had gone out
fast."

Mike Nawrocki led the
Grinnellians by finishing fourth in a
time of26248. ”Mike has been nurs-
ing a sore knee, but it didn’t seem to
bother him," conveyed Freeman.
Barry Matchett was eighth in 27:23
and Chris Mills and Jefolmer were
right behind in thh and 14th. Mark
Beilstein rounded out the scoring in
let place.

Freeman was pleased with
his top group's performance, noting
they had a lot to give at the end oftlte
race. He received some great results
from his second group, which could
end up being the difference in tho
squad’s performance late in the sea-
son. “Our second group is closing in
on our first group. If they ever catch
the first groupour team depth will be
greatly improved," exclaimed Free»
man, '

Jim Mills finished 45th and
Zander Cannon was 46m, just 50
seconds off of Beilstein. Also lared
Schettler and and Byron Johnson
lookedgood in 52nd and 61 st places,

“The Beloit meet is always
a good team builder, but this year the
event brought our conﬁdence back.
Ourathletesseemodtore-focus,lookr
ing toward die end of the season at
theNCAAregionalmeet,”conciuded

Freeman.

ThePioneers will be atCen-
tral College inPclla this weekend for
the Iowa Small College Meet “We
have a chance to win the [meet],
which would be our first title at that
invitational,” explained Freeman. “I
feel Luther should be favored to win
Saturday because they beat us at our
home invitational. However, we are
healthy again, and when we are
healthy we can run at a national-
caliber level,” said Freeman.
