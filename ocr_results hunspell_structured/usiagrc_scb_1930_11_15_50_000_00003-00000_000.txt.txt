Writes for London Paper

The difficulties of reporting were
set forth by the “Star" reporter,
when he told of obtaining a story of
the return of the 138th infantry from
France. A leased wire that should
to convey his
story to the United Press office fail—
ed to materialize, and it being before
the days of practical long distance
telephoning, Brundidge decided to in»
stall a telegraph line by using a
"buzzer” on the telephone lines. He
finally obtained telegraph service
and sent an exclusive story to his
paper.

other adventures included tracking
of narcotic rings and liquor smug—
glers.

Besides reporting for the st. Louis
paper, Brundidge also writes for the
London Dauy Mail, Colliers magazine,
and other publications. He has Write

is “Twinkle, Twinkle Movie Star.“

Wood Contributes to Effect

Margaret Wood as Jane West, rose

ness actually contributing to the ef-
fect of the play in the last. Dorothy
Luring as Mrs. Fulverton—Fane, Wal—

Maurice Birdsall as Police Constable
Mallet, held character parts which
at times reached a superb comedy re—
lief. Nor would the play have been
complete without Adams, that most
proper and true»to-Lype butler. play—

The handicap of the small stage
was scarcely noticeable: the room
was made, in spite of its shallowness,
the fitting environment for the den
tion. 'The pictures on the wall, the
coat of arms, the wood-carvings, the
book- cases, all the work of the ex
perimental theater, were small but
integral parts of the general effect.

English Accent lnoffensive

The English accent was kept in-
offensive to the realism of the play,
except in the parts of the major, and
the constable, where its eccentricities
were featured.

Not a great deal of back-stage
work was evident; but both proper-
ties and lighting were managed
without hesitation, or awkward mom-
cuts. For the short waits between
acts, the audience was particularly
grateful. ,

All this must close with the usua

a whole, 'al‘ld it was a badly crippled
Pioneer team that put over the two
scores.

Humphrey Plucekicks Scoro

Humphrey, Grinnell tackle, was
forced to leave the game in the sec-
ond period with a broken left hand,
while Thomas, brilliant quarter, did
not play in the second half because
of injuries to his leg.

The first quarter was slow, both
teams making short gains and then
exchanging punts, with Grinnell hold-
ing the edge. In the second period
Cornell worked the hall to the 43 yard
line with end runs and cuts through
tackle. Grifﬁn then heaved a long
pass to Helmar, who caught it on
Grinnell's seven yard line. Two tries
through the Grinnell line failed, and
Grifﬁn placekicked the ball squarely
between the bars. Score: Cornell 3.
Grinnell, 0.

Miuier Tackles for Loss

With two regulars out and the score
3—0 against them in the ﬁnal pei'lod,
the Grinnell team woke up. Grant of
Cornell circled left end to put the
ball on Grinnell‘s ﬁve yard line. Min—
ier slipped through the line to throw
Grant for a ﬁve yard loss, while
Douglas intercepted Grifﬁn's pass in
back of his own goal and sprinted
to Grinnell's 25 yard line.

Adamson intercepted Ullrich‘s short
pass to give the Purple team the or-
fensive on Grinnell's 15 yard stripe.
James caught a Cornell pass and ran
it to the 24 yard line. Then Ullrich
reeled off his spectacular run for
Grinnell’s ﬁrst score.

Grlunell Threatens

With the scoring in their favor. the
Pioneers displayed a different brand
of football for the rest of the game.
Slashes off tackle and guard were
generally effective, and the Scarlet
and Brock marched down the field
for its second score.

Even with almost a complete sec-
ond team on the ﬁeld, the Grinnell
outﬁt moved steadily toward the
Cornell goal, and for a while it locked
