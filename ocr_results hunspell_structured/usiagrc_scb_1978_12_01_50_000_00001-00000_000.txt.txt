KDIC 'trOubles provoke investigation

by Dan Flynn

Questions dealing with the enforcement
of FCC rules at KDIC have prompted the
Student Publications and Radio Com-
mittee (SPSIR) to undertake a full»scale
investigation of station management

An 5&3 investigation into the alleged
violations led KDIC’s adviser, William
Deminolt, to call the then-unorganized
SP&R committee to "ﬁber to look into the
problem

CONCURRENTLY, Kurt Anderson,
KDIC station manager, requested that the
committee take disciplinary action
against “Doc” Elliot Pollock, station
communications director. Anderson
charged Pollock with “non-productive and
negative actions."

Speciiically, Anderson charges that
‘Pollock does not have a properly posted
license at KDIC, that he hasn't fulfilled
some othls duties and thatheatred ”a long
list oi signiiicant Charges about my
operation oi the station only to the Scarlet
and Black." Earlier, Anderson Claimed
that Pollock instigated the 8&1! in-
vestigation.

POLLOCK CONTENDS that the charges
against his perlormance are false. The
SszR investigation into the matter has not
proceeded well; at Wednesday's meeting
which was supposed to serve as a tack
iinding session. a quorum did not show up.

The Anderson-Pollock conflict chiefly
involves two factors. First, there are
substantial differences in management
philosophy and operational procedures.
Next. there seems to bed personality clash
between Anderson and Pollock, possibly
the result of problems at KDIC last year,

IN AN INTERVIEW with the 5&8
Pollock cited several FCC Violations,
thludlng logging errors, drinking and
smoking at the station and problems with
the Emergency Broadcast Systeml and
claimed that his request for Anderson to
act on the matters resulted in nothing
Anderson claims that the Violations are
fewiu drastic decrease over the past
Years.

Ile feels that Doc Elliot's complaints
stem both “his deep involvement in
commercial radii)” and a iailurc to “un
dcrstand non-commercial, free-format

radio at Grinnell." Elliot replies that even
free-format stations are answerable to the
FCC

DISCOUNTING THIS, Anderson claims
that the FCC is not tough with minor
violations at ten-watt educational stations.
He cites past serious problems at KDIC.
saying that the FCC nonetheless renewed
the station’s license, But Pollock uses the
same example saying, “Last time they
let us get away With just an apologyibut
this time they’ve got thatletter, and it they
see we haven‘t improved they won‘t be too
happy ”

Pollock stresses that Anderson must
cniorcc station policy. Anderson says that
policy is being eniorccd to the degree that
he sees necessary He points out that
“Grinnell people don't like being tied with
a lot of restrictions "

PROGRAM DIRECTOR Tom Rayiiel
agrees ile says that stricter enforcement
of rules would create a “Nazi~like atr
mosphere at the station and stille dcerjays’
Creativity."

Disc jockey Trcna Cleland disagrees.
While streSSlng that she is overall im~

pressed with management, she feels “FCC
rules are being broken much of the time."
She calls policies in these areas “largely
empty threats,” and Says that “creativity
would not be hurt by stricter eniorcement
of the rules,”

ADAM STERLING, another disc Jockey,
agrees that the rules are not being en.
iorced, “especially among the station’s
hierarchy," He adds that the rules should
be cniorced1 he [eels that a bad mood at
the station would not thus be created.

But deejays Stevc Smith and Steve
Silbcrherg support Anderson’s and
Raytiel’s positions, Smith says that people
realize the Consequences oi violating
policy. and thus obcy the rules. Silbcrberg,
who has been at KDIC for [our years, says
that “people respect the new equipment
and want to keep it in good shape . . there
are less problems this year than i've seen
before,”

WEDNESDAY, Deminoii, acting in the
absence oi committee chairman Mark
Johnson. proposed that “since the matter
is extremely important," the committee

Leichtling’s letter is in response
to an article run in the September

article concerned the controversy

“betray the true moral climate oi

“it must be clear to anyone who

Judicial Council lays clown the law

by Anne liawland

Violations of students‘ rights in
two instances prompted the college
Judicial Council to hold hearings
tor the iirsttime since the spring oi
1977.

In the most recent incident, two
students were accused oi pers
petrating a iood light in Quad
which caused a glass to break on
another student’s tray. No one was
injured. but Food Service Director
Dave McConnell, who brought the
charges, explalns that he did so
because “We could have had a
serious accident.”

McConnell admits that ”it's not
tun for any student to have to be
singled out,” but he maintains,
“the greater concern is that people
can come in and not have to worry
about their safety.”

One of the accused students feels
the incident could have been
handled better, “We were given a
piece of paper, which was slipped
under our door, asking us to ap
pear—nothing , verbal was ever

said to us ”

Lynn Bougheyt who as SGA vice.
president also acts as prosecutor
[or the Council, describes the
hearing itself as “very relaxed,
everyone was just trying to get the
truth out.” He also notes that
“students may ask to have the
hearing closed, but in this case
they wanted to leave the meeting
open to allow other Students to see
what the process is like."

Boughey stresses, “The Council
is not a law court, it's a hearing
Nothing that happens goes on your
personal records." He also says,
“It (the Council) is more of a selfs
government. We handle things that
would normally have to be handled
through civil or criminal courts.”

Both students pleaded guilty
and were given a warning not to be
brought bclore the Council on the
some charges again for the
remainder " the year.

'l‘ht _. also ordered Mes
Connell to post signs warning
students Ot‘hlS intent Itovre’port

lurther incidents.

To this McConnell responded, “I
don't really feel that I should have
to post signs. Somewhere in a
person’s 18 years, or whatever, he
should have learned that throwing
food is not acceptable,” He did say,
however, that signs would be
posted sometime this week.

The other Council hearing oc-
curred because a student accused
another student of smoking in a
non-smoking section oi a dining
hall. The oiiending party was iined
$5.

- Boughey feels thatone reason ior
the Sudden increase in Judicial
Council hearings is that “people
are more aware oi their rights,"
He notes the charges against a
student can be brought by anyone,
or even on behalf of a hall. But, he
says, “problems should be handled
on a low level With the hall reps as
mediators. Only the greater in
vasion oi rights such as theI‘L
assault, et cetera, should be

_brought before the Council.”
