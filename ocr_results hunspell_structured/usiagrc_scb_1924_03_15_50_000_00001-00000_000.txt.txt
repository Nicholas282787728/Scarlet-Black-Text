O’Neil Play Is First Tragedy
Given Here — No Applause
Till Final Curtain.

The production of Eugene O'Neill's
"Beyond the Horizon" by the Gl'in'nell
College Dramatic Club tonight
marks the beginning of a new era in
college dramatic; It is the must Eun-
hitious undertaking or recent years,
and the first tragedy presented by the

Other unusual.features make the
production of interest. A child as
sumes an important part in this play,
and her remal able work is the result
of marked ability and excellent coach-
iog. Six scenes wcrc necessary for
“Beyond the Horizon,” their ConstruCe
tion and manipulation requiring the
attention of a large technical staff.

The play itsell is a gruelling test
for the actors. Eight years pass dun
ing its thrcc acts, and necessitate an
external change in each or the char-
acters. There are three tremendous
climaxes which tax the strength of
each actor to the limit. ,

The Dramatic club urges the audi-
ence to be in their seats promptly at
eight o’clock, for no one will be ad—
mitted during the first scene. Spec-
tators are also requested to refrain
from a demonstration of any kind un-
til the final curtain. »

“More People Proved Innocent
Than Guilty" Says Pasco in
Y, M. C, A, Lecture.

“Finger prints prove more people
innocent than they prove guilty, and
always Will,” and ”Finger prints In.
the scene of a. crime and in direct 1'0-
iation to a. crime is only one branch
of the great Work made possible by
ﬁnger prints.” were two interesting
statements made by Harry Pasno,
state fingerprint expert. at v. M. c. A.
meeting Thursday evening.

Mr. Pasno then quoted cases where
fingerprints had proven the innocence
of a man. He went into the larger
ﬁelds 01' the Work, by quoting some
smtisﬁcs. Every year Potter’s Field
adds forty thousand to its list of un<
known humans, Universal registra-

tion of ﬁnger prints would eliminate.

Potter's Field. A case of this variety
was cited. A young man held for
forgery, gave his name as John Doe
and hanged himself before he came to
trial. By ﬁnger—prints his identity
was discovered; he was a family black
sheep; and by identiﬁcation his mo-
tlier knew the late of her son, and
was able to give him a decent burial.

and navy, not for criminal purposes,
but for identiﬁcation. ~

The ﬁnger-plint work of the state
is carrlcd on under the Department of
Justice, where Mr. Pasno. as one of the
men in the Bureau of lnvcstiagtion,
handled the finger-prints. Each shci-ill
is now required to take prints of all

sut of these prints is kept in the state

Interesting Phase of American
Tradition Will Be Theme of
Lecture Monday.

l One oi the most interesting phases
of American tradition will he presents
ed before a Crinncll audience Monday
night when Lucine Finch is scheduled
to give her famous interpretation or
negro Mammy stories and unpublished
religious songs of the Old South. Miss
Finch is an artist in the highest sense
of the word and her superior work in
this field has gained for her a nation—
wide reputation.

The recognrition which Miss Finch
has received is derived from a two—
fold origin. In the first place she is a
stlldcut or the picturesque negro lore
or the days before the Civil War and
has devoted painstaking effort to a
study of these old songs and tales as
they were rendered in the original. In
the second place, Miss Finch has an
unusual ability oi interpreting these
relics of stories and spiritual exhor-
tations so that the whole atmosphere
or those unique days is brought before
her audiences with unusual vividness,

Speaking of her works W. D. How<
els said, “It was mighty rich and
glowing and full of histironic passion."
Adolph Klnuber, dramatic critic of the
New York Times, also praised her.
saying, “She has a sympathetic appre-
ciation of the negro character with un-
usual iacility in giving this character
expression, both in voice and gesture,"
Arthur Brisbane characterized one of
her pertorlnances as "a portrayal such
as has never before been given on a»
New York stage.”

other critics of note such as Kate
Wiggin and James Bennctt express
similar approval oi the outstanding
accomplishments of Miss Finch in the
study of these old songs and tales as
role of interpreter or the slave ct aute-

lmllum days.

NORRIS SPEAKS ~
AT Y. W. MEETIN

“Religion and Evolution” Is the
Theme of His Talk.

American

“There never has been a natural an.
tngunlsm between evolution and relig-
ion,‘ declared Prof. H. W. Norlis in a
talk bcforc the y, W. C. A. Thursday
evcuing, “Religion is itself a process
of evolutio "

There are two illndamentally dit-
.lcrcut theories of the universe as we
now liud itgspeelal creation and evor
lution. The [ornier bases on the ac
count of the crcatiou found in the Bi»
blc, while the latter finds its ui'gu»
ments in nature.

All tlleories run against the some
problem, the beginning, something ln~
conceivable to the human mind. “Some
postulate is necessary. Any will be
inconceivable, What is the differ
ence?" asked Professor Norri . “The
important thing is not to explain the
universe by any theory, but to find
out how things were actually done."

“The universe in its present state
is obviously the result ol a long pro-
cess or change. Evolution is the 'only
rational explanation. Any other would
be an insult to our imaginations,” de-
clared Professor Norris.

The Bible is not a scientific treatise,
but a history or mass search for God.
Through many years, man has ac-
quired his religion, the recognition of
the divine in nature and the ordering
or his life in accordance with it.

“Live religion must grow.” said Pl‘oe
fessor Norris in conclusion. “It is this
growth in religion which is to me the

placed one man each on the mythical

It is an exceedingly hard task to
pick an all—valley team, because each
of the men must be considered in-
dividually. A poor man may make
a good showing because he is on a
good team, and a good man may not
show exceptional abi ty because he is
a member of a losing quintet, The
above selection seems to show a fair
consideration of each man-s merits.

forward positions on the i at aggre—

which won only four valley games.

man in every contest. but in spite oi
this fact. he succeeded in hitting the
basket consistently. Bcuz is exceed-
ingly ditficuit to guard without being
fouled, and the fact that be lead the
valley in free throws, shows that he
was a dangerous man to foul. Benz
scored in out of 100 chances at the
free throw line.

McBride was also a heavy scorer. Mc-
Brlde finished the season in third
place in individual scoring. He play-
ed good consistant ball throughout the
season and rightly deserycs a place

of Ackerman, is given a guard posi-
