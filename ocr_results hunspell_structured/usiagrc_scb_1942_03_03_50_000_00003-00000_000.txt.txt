present the play as a series of
transitions from mood to mood
rather than from scene to scene.

Invention of Michael Chekhov.
director of the troupe and former
leader of the second Moscow Art
Theater, this visible scenery
changing is part of his plan to
make Shakespeare more enjoyable
by eliminating the long waits be-
tween scenes. Another is the use
of only “hand props” with a
Simple purple curtain forming the
background of all action, as in the
original Shakespearisn theater.

Formed in 1936 at the English
home of Miss Beatrice Whitney
Straight, who is now a member
of the troupe, the Chekhov play»
ers moved to this country when
war threatened in 1933.

"Twelfth Night” has not only
been presented frequently by the
Ridgefield players, but Chekhov
has directed four other produc-
tions of the comedy in Europe
Most unusual of these was the
presentation in Hebrew by the
Habima players of Berlin Chek-
hov had no knowledgc of Hebrew;
his cast knew no other language.
Though he could give no vocal
directions to his cast, this pro-
duction was hailed by European
critics as his most outstanding
piece of work.
