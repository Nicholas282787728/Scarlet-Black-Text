‘CARLET AND BLACK

The off-campus alternative

by Mike Ellis

You‘re awakened at two in
the morning when the decibel
level of the dorm suddenly
exceeds that of the last ten Who
concerts combined. You‘ve been
waiting in line at Cowles for
what seems like days; you
wonder what the linerup at lunch
will be like. You're sure your
reclusive neighbor knows your
innermost hairstyling secrets.
To be serious, it's time you left
the warmth and security of the
dorms.

You’re beginning to wonder
about offrcampus living, A first
question to consider might be:
“Do I opt for OCCOI-I or for
OCNCOH?”

If you’re going to be a
sophomore next year the answer's
easy. Only 150 juniors and
seniors can live in OCNCOH
(offrcampus non-college-owncd
housing), with seniors getting
priority. A lottery will be held
for any remaining spaces. This
is a good reason why juniors
should not sign leases before the
offAcampiis Signrup deadline of
March 3, unless you really need
two places to live. The deadline
to sign-up for off-campus
college-owned housing (OCCOH)
is March 7. See the housing
packet for funher details.

Next you’ll want to start
inspecting some of these retreats
yourself. College-owned housing
is easy to check. Just look for
the beige buildings. Apartments
are a little more difficult to find.
However, many apartments

annually house students, so these
can he found by consulting the
off-campus directory. Give them
a ring and tell them you'll be
around to see the place. You
might also want to call the real-
tors in town. They sometimes
have a few aparunents for lease.

Once you take these steps the
difference between OCCOH and
become apparent. With OCCOH
you're living with many people,
you don't have to deal wida crazy
landlords (unless you put up
Greek letters), and chances are
you‘ll just have to walk farther to
dinner (only five of the OCCO
houses are equipped with
complete kitchens.) There are
only 11 houses available so the
choices are narrowed down:
Student Housing decides for you.
OCCO houses are kind of like a
dorm away from the dorms; the
maid is still there to chat with
you every day and three B and G
men still show up to fix a
window ora door.

With OCNCOH, things are
not so simple. There are a
million apartmenisyout there and
you're sure the next one is going

to have rt view of the ocean, with
a pool and a heated garage, like
something out of “Dallas." You
might as well try to see as many
as you can. Do all the obvious
things like comparing prices, and
check all the essentials such as
plumbing. furniture, and kitchen
appliances. One subtlety that
may make a big difference in

prices is the inclusion of utilities
in the rental agreement.

Not surprisingly, many
cockroaches decide to move off
campus also. You might want to
ask the landlord to pay for an
exterminator. Some pests can be
a little bit harder to remove,
though. A neighbor of mine is
having trouble with Degz, but
apparently the noisy critters can
play a tune or two. This is a
good reason to find out how
many sub-units there are in the
house you'll be movmg into.
While it’s impossible to obtain
your neighbors' clinical records,

the current tenant may be able to
give you an inside scoop on the
place. Don‘t hesitate to ask.
Above all, though this may
sound silly, read the lease. Your
firstrborn may thank you. Be
sure any agreements you make
are in writing. According to
Diane Daugherty, director of
Student Housing. one of the
biggest dilemmas students face is
unfulfilled promises from
landlords. She suggests you
make sure everything is oomplete
before you scuttle off for the
summer. Once you come back
from vacation, it’s too late to
press your case. Dougherty will

Mock trial team
excels in Des Moines

by Beth Wodzinskl

On February 18 and 19, the
Grinnell College Mock Trial
teatns competed in the Fifth
Annual Intercollegiate Mock
Trial Competition at Drake
University in Des Moines. The
two teams were among more than
70 teams from 50 colleges rep-
resenting t.lie entire country.

The legal case used in the
competition concerned the will of
the elderly Marian Cress, which
was contested by a sibling,
Frances Baxter. Each team had to
prepare both the plaintiffs and
the defendant’s side of the case for
the competition.

A team is composed of six
peopleilhree lawyers and three
witnesses. The lawers on the
White team were president and
founder Dcvani Seheidler. Thom
Main, and Rashmi DyalAChand.
and the witnesses were Karen
Lehman, Jon Wentzel and
Manish Acharya. 0n the Blue
team, the lawyers were Walt
Junker, Sarah Purcell, and Joan
Johnson; the witnesses were Pete
Simon, Beth Wodzinski, and
Jennifer Deaderick. The teams
were advised by Des Moincs
attorneys Brian Scieszinski and
Terry Brown.

Two Grinnell students distin-
guished themselves at the
competition: lawyers Waltlunker
and‘Thom Maine placed among
the top 10 lawyers and received
trophies.

Although the teams as a
whole did not win any awards,

Schcidler estimated that both
teams were easily among the top
20. “We competed against
several teams that were in the top
10, and they weren‘t that much
better than we were,” she said,
pointing out that Grinnell's
showing is a remarkable
achievement for the teams in
their first year or competition,
and that the teams had spent only
three weeks working on the case.

The teams were rated on a
scale of l to 10 on qualities such
as grasp of the case, objections

(for the attorneys), and
believability (for the witnesses).
Most of the scores recieved by
the Grinnell teams were 8 and 9:
few scores were lower than a 7.
Scheidlcr and all the members of
the teams are extremely happy
with the results of the
competition and are eagerly
looking forward to next year,

Although the teams have
never competed before, this was
not their first experience with
mock trial. Last semester, the
teams presented an exhibition
trial sponsored by the
HRC/GRC. The case dealt with
date rape, an issue which was
receiving a great deal of attention
at the time. "We‘ve gotten a lot
better since then," said Thom
Main.

Scheidler is planning another
exhibition trial this semester;
this one will deal with the issue
of homosexual discrimination in
the workplace.

quickly some of her less-ﬂuent
classmates had trouble

“Girls have little opportunity.
A lot depends on chance. There

This comes from man’s ideas,
traditional ideas,” she said. “But
it's not important if it's a boy or

them to be more brave and to

have high goals.“

reactions.

“Girls are less trouble—"
