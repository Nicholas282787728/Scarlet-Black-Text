several points hciore their rivals
counted. The locals held this advan-
tage throughtont the hair, which ended

tor Crinncii in the second half, and
although they played good ball. they
' lost their long lead, the visitors crawl-
ing to within two points or knottiug
' the count. The ﬁrst string then went
. in [or the remainder oi the contest
