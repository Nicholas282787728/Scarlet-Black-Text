Dr. iarn Hunter and

B y Schales Atkinson

' The two Grinnell physicians who came
to speak on "The Pathway to Becoming a
Physician." Dr. William Hunter and Dr
Robert Carney, presented their advice by
giving accounts oi their varied
backgrounds and citing concrete suggess
tions on prevmed preparation and applying
to medical school ' ,

Dr, Hunter had not considered medicine
as a career until he recognized that the
type of work he had trained (or was no
longer in demand. His first job as a
newspaper copy boy exposed him to the
lack of openings in the newspaper iield.
Hunter then began to research better
career opportunties. Alter attending night
school and performing well on science ap-
titude tests, he began a pie-med course at
Study. Hunter attended Kent State as an
undergraduate and Howard Medical
School. Afterwards. Hunter served his
military duty by working lor the New York
Public Health service.

Dr. Carney. however. knew early on that
he wanted to have a career in the medical
field A special relationship with his home
town doctor and two painful childhood
losscs. inspired Carney to be a doctor “to
relieve people or their pain,"

Alter attending a vocational high school.
Carney enlisted in the Army Medrcore.
There he worked as a clerk in a doctors’ of»
fice. Having been translerred to Hawaii,
h e began to go to the University or Hawaii
as a night student When Carney returned
from his duty, he attended Fisch in
Nashville to get a Zoology major Aiter ap
plying to many medical schools, only to be
turned down, he began a graduate degree
program at Meharry, attending classes

with the medical school students there

During this long period oi schooling, the
ii rrny paid ior some of Carney's expenses
what that money did not cover. he earned
by waiting tables. selling cutlery, and
other jobs which he said, "A lot oi people
w ouldn't want to do. But I think it's all part
oi a well rounded person."

Hunter then spoke oi the major areas oi

school Periormzincc on the MCAT exam.

a nd a personal interview were the points oi

One deviation that Hunter had heard oi in
the application proccss was the evaluation
at a student's nonracademic activities. in

podiwoy to becoming a physician.”

is ppliant’s ability to interact with people on
a day to day basis. Applying as early as
junior year to several diiierent medical
schools was also a suggestion irom the
doctors.

Hunter commented on the decrease in
student loans and scholarshipsThe iailure
ol students in repaying their sponsors and
a lack ol government iunds is the cause or
this decrease, Hunter did encourage
students to iind out about available innds
and to remember that periorming well in
the iirst two years will inspire trust in pro
spcclivc sponsors

The physicians stressed determination
both in applying to medical school, and in
the pursuit oia medical career.
