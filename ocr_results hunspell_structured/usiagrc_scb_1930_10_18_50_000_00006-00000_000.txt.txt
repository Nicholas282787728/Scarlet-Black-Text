Coach Watt's strategy in using
Grnihind to back up the line failed
cztrly in the game, aftcr Van Kotcn

from the Drake 18 yard mark to the
31 yard line.
another yard and King went through
thc line for seven, Van Kctcn crack~
ed center to the Grinnell 41 yard
line, King hit guard for a yard, and
Van Koten romped through for si
more. With a score in sight, the
touted line plunging of Lahsrud came
into action as he pounded left center;
for four yards, King took
three moi-e and Lansriid made it first
down on the Pioneer 15 yard line. On
three plays, Dansrud went to the
Grinnell three yard line and then
drove right tackle for the touchdown.
King’s dropkick was good for the ere
tra point.

Captain Douglas Scores
Grinnell received and on a SOsym‘d
pass. Ruff to Douglas. went to the
Drake 45 yard line as the second
quarter opened, 1verson intercepted
Ruff‘s next toss on the 39 yard rib-
bon, however. Two penalties kept
the Bulldogs from making downs,
and Thomas returned King's kick
eight yards to the Grinnell 34 yard
stripe.

Douglas hit right tackle for seven
yards and a pass, Ruff to Douglas,
took the oval to the Drake 46 yard
line again. A spinner pass play. Ruff_
to Douglas, sent the ball to the Bull-
dog 18 yard line, where the Pioneers
were held for downs and lost the
hall.

King clipped off eight yards
through» the line, but Grinnell held
for three plays, and Bilto stepped in‘
to block King's kick which rolled out.
side on the Drake 17 yard line. On
a double pass, end-around play, Min-
ier picked up five yards and three‘
more line plunges made it first down‘
on the seven yard stripe. A pass,
Ruff to Douglas, sent the oval over,
for six points. Ruff‘s placekick tied
the count at 7-7.

Douglas Gains Consistently

King took the kick-off and streak.
ed down the field to the Grinnell 22
yard line before lie was stopped, but
the Pioneers held there and were in
possession of the oval as the half
ended.
Drake received to start the third
quarter and was stopped on the 45‘
yard line. Thomas returned King's
punt to the 30 yard stripe and Doug—l
las went through tackle and cut back
for nine yards on the first play.
The blond Pioneer captain seemed
the only Grinnellian able to gain con-
sistently through the line. Two more
plays were stopped and Thomas took
a had pass from center and got off a
quick kick to the Drake 37 yard line.
The Bulldogs drew a 15 yard pen-
alt and kicked to Thomas on the
Grinnell 43 yard stripe, where Ull-
rich made three at tackle and a pass,
Ruff to Thomas, was good for 15
more. Douglas picked up seven in
two line plunges, and a pass was
complete on the Drake 10 yard stripe,
but the play was called back for a
Grinnell offside. Douglas kick was
down at the 26-yard stripe.

Christoffcrseii Blocks Kick
The Bulldog plungers drove to
midfield and Brewer took a 20 yard
pass, after which King circled right

the line for the touchdown, but
Christoffersen blocked his kick for
extra point,

With the count 13 to 6 against
them, the Pioneers made their bid
for a score early in the fourth qlldrr
tcr, when the combination of Doug-
lils' off tackle slashes and Rllft's
passes carried the leather to the
Drake 30 yard line, only to be held
,for downs thcre.

Here the Gl'lnncll team seemingly
gave way to the overpowering drin
'ing attack of the Bulldogs, and thc
;bluc and white tcam marched down
.the field for its third touchdown, Van
jKotcn carrying the ball ovcr and
litiiig making the kick to bring the
‘count to 2D to 7,

Passing Attack Fiiils

The Griuncll passing attack failed
to function against the second string
‘Drftke lineup, and the Bulldog res
serves took the ball in midfield near
‘the end of the game plunging to the
Grinnell five yard line before the gun.

The Giinnell team showed plenty
of fight, but lacked the drive demon-
strated against Drake in 1929. The
speed and efficiency with which the
Drake team functioned made the Pier
neers seem sluggish on their offense,
while Drake runners continually slid
away from Grinnell tackleis for ad-
ditional yardage.

Capt. Ben Douglas made a valiant
attempt to give his team gains
through the line, while Rllff's passing
was as usual one of the outstanding
features of the contest. King, Van
Koten, and Lansihd were the stars
of the contest for Drake, while the
entire Bulldog line, relying chiefly on
its superior wcight, steam-rollercd
the Pioneer line time after time.
