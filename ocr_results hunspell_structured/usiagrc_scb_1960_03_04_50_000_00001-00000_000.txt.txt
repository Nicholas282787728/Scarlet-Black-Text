Clubs To Host
African Visitor

All official of the Ethio-
pian government administ \—
. tion, Teelou Delnessullou, i ll
be the guest of the llllei’nit—
tional Relations club and
other campus student groups
Wednesday and Thursday.
Delncssahou’s visit is being

g, sponsored by the U. 5. Depart:

ment of State and the coni—
mittce on loaders and speciala
ists oi the American Council on
Education.

According to Harold Fletcher
(political scieneel, the allied!
oi Delnessahon's visit will be
to permit him “to become
acquainted with an American
liberal arts college and with
the citizens or a typical mid-
western college community."
Fletcher said that

saliou is ”not only an expert on
Ethiopian government admin
tration and policies, but he
also thoroughly tamiliar with
the social and economic prolr
1cms oi Ethopia and with inter—
national ouostions as they to:
late to his country,” l
While Delnessaliou has dealt

' .Jvitli various agricntural prob
lcms, he is not, Fletcher l
stressed, primarily ti tarni spe- ‘
cialist. Delnessahou has serv- l
ed in various government po -
tions ior his country and at l
the present time is director l
general or the administration .
division or the Mi istry oi
agriculture in Ethiopia. This
position involves responsib'-

.ity ior ministry personnel, ac-

oonnting, transportation and
property administration.

political situation in
The program

ntcrnational Studios Program

will be presented in Herrick
chapel at 8:00 pm

Todd's knowledge of the Airi—
czm Situation is iI result of
many years of ﬁrst-hand ex»
perience. A native of New an~
land, Todd hits spent most of
his liie in Southern Arrival In
1934 after training for the Mis-
sion field. he and his wife
were appointed as missionaries
to Dadayn Mission in Suuihern
Rhodesia.

F0 their iirst thirteen years as

inis aarics, Todd and his wile
were without European helpers.
They came to depend heavily up.
on native assistance as th
worked among some 20.000 Airi—
cans.
While actively engaged in mis-
sionary work, Todd was a long-
time mcmber oi the Executive
committee oi the Missionary
Conference oi Southcrn Rhode-
sia and the Advisory commit—
tee to the Government on Na-
tivc Education,

with his election to Parliament
in 1946, Todd became active on
the Rhodesian political scene.
seven Vears later he was elected

the

,Pl‘lce Minister of Southern Rho<

dcsia. He continued in that post
until 1958,

Todd has been a proponent
oi liberal political policies
throughout his career, He has
recently been instrumental in
nrganizine‘ the Central Airica
which is pledged to
build a united nation under the
crown and to ensure that the
great ireedoms arc accented as
the right oi every inhabitant oi
the Federation.

Now as a result of eiioris by
Todd and other political leaders
in Airica, political policies in
Central Airica are being tormu-
lated bv representatives oi all
races working together.
