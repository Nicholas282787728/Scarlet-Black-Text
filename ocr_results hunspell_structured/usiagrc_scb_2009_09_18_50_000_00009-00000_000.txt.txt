Grinncll’s High Street has heard its fair share ofwcird
house names, but The House Across the Street from
Blank House House is cettainly the longest, and tesidents
Vincent Gecls’lOJames Meinert’lO, Phil Hagen'lO and
Gteg Rossi '10 ate ptoud ofit.

“Phil and I picked the name,"Gcels said. “We really
wanted a name that would have the word ‘ltouse'in it as
many times possible. We aguted it'd be awesome when
wc'd throw putticsithe narnc ofthc house would sound
so coolAso we came up with this."

Across the road from a “blank” and bland looking
white house (hence the name), and tucked behind trees
on the edge ofl'ligh Sticetjustfeetfrom the train tracks,
the house seems perfect for the gang because of all the
messy cooking and pattying that they ate up tot, “Only
two ofus ate without a dining planithat’d be Phil and
I," Geels said, “So I cook a lot and bake As for Phil, he
just cats cottage cheese Anything inside a can that is
edible is ﬁne with him.”

While it is a college house and mcssiness is inevitable,
some aieas need to stay as blank and spotless as theit
namesake, “I always need the kitchen to be clean fol
cooking, and these guys have been helpingxcecls said,

Of all the houses ol’tr campus, the house across the

1005 High Street is actually two apartments. But
that didn't really work for Caitlin Vaughan ’10, Eleanor
Nelson ’10, Neal Wepking '10, Kati Ktemling ’10 ot
Dean Porter ’10. So they broke down the doorian

“Dean's dad came and helped us," said Vaughan.

Tile walls of 1005 were already deeoiated when the
cuirenr iesidents moved in, but most ofit was sent to the

At 1005, it is all about the food. “We try to eat
dinnet togethct ﬁve days a week...that's a big patt of
out house," Vaughan said. Each membct of the house
cooks dinnet once a week, latgely with local vegetables

“We have a CSA [Community Suppotted

local meat soon as well.“We’te thinking about getting a

There's a gnome sitting in the corner, a knife sticking
out of the door frame, huge homemade chocolate chip
cookies made by Kathetine Dean '10, thtee gigantic sun-
ﬂowcts on the table, a tapestty of Buddha hanging on the
twill and a photo ochus in the hallJ'his house deﬁnitely
belongs to a college student. Or three:

Addy Najcta '10, Anna Fact ’10 and Dean met each
other when they lived in Cleveland their ﬁrst year at
Grinnell and all three seem to ﬁilﬁll certain roles in the
house family Dean was described by Friel as the mom, “but
without the disciplincfthings “fail apatt when Katherine’s
not hete," Fricl said. Najcm describes herself as the ctazy
aunt, while giving Fricl the title of“ptobl:m child,"

When asked to describe the house, Najera said,“Our
bmnets don't teally match up with out knobs," tetetting
to their confusing stove which caused a glass pan to ex-
plode. Whether this was pattialiy the ehcr's tault was not
admitted

All who cuter the house are offered lots offood, such
as cookies and gteen ttosting, and must play to both Jesus
and Buddha, who Naieia deseiibed as “hot.”

“Jesus, a Jew, and Buddha, an Indian] am content."
she said.

the housemates value solidutity and they love to have
sleepovets. When one poison btings someone home, the
othets must all btmg home someone as well, because, ac—
eotding to Najem,“Men usually come in thtees.”

The gitls also show theit solidatity by watching out tot
each other‘s safety. Friel insisted Dean not sit under the
knife sticking out oftl-u: doorframe, asking, “Who would
cook for us,"Y

The house got its name mystctiously Peoplcjusl statted
calling it “The Psych Ward.”The gitls also think that it’s
because they can read minds, and have incorporated this
theoty into a house motto: “Psychic, not psycho."

They plan on thtowing a One Flew Ovet the Cuckoo’s
Nest patty on the Ftiday betote Halloween Hattis,and they
always encourage visitotsfnianks to Dean,you'te sute to be
fed, but it is not “guatanteed that you’ll make it out alive,”
Friel said. “Or unviolated,"Najera added.
