IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA. WEDNESDAY. MAY 24-, 1905.

 

AT OTHER COLLEGES,

Honorable Stand Taken at Western
Universities in Regard lo Alhlelicsi
Drake to Win State Meet.

The inﬂuence or the two leading
western Universities. Stanford and
California, which has ever been in the
right direction, is placing those insti-
tutions neztr the head among schools
who are trying to make ideals. Dur-
ing the coming summer and fall spec»
ial attention will be given by tile
faculty athletic committee to the
enforcement of the intercollegiate
agreement regarding amateur stand-
ing in athletics. An amateur is deﬁn-
ed as “one who has not entered in
open competition (or a stake. public
money, admission money, or entrance
fee; or under a ﬁctitious name; or has
not competed with or against a protes-
sional for any prize, or where admis
sion fee is charged; or who has not
instructed, pursued or assisted ill the
pursuit or athletics exercise asameuns

or livelihood, or ror gain or any emoln.
“lent.” '

The cooperative company 0[ the
University or Wisconsin has declared
dividends to its stock holders or lo
per cent, or 13 per cent in trade. Last
,year the dividends amounted to 9 per
cent or 121 percent in trade.

Tlle University of Minnesota is tak-
iuk sharp measures to prevent graft
in the various students enterprises.
The faculty in its consideration
conclude that an auditing committee
or lour raculty members and three
students, the latter to be elected by
the student ’ body, shall audit all
accounts of the various publications
and societies, and submit the same
to open inspection.

This morning’s Register (Mill Luuilal'
contains this cheerful bit of antic'
pntioll concerning Drake Unirer-
sity and its chances in the state
meet:

“Thompson took a fast, workout in
the mile Monday and While Monil'ntw
will not give out the time, it is known
that he went the distﬂhfe luster than
any one else has this year. He ﬁnish»
ed strong and they say at Drake that
he can be counted upon Lo take that
event away from Curtis

But the biggest surprise ol all is
Kint’l. in the hammer throw. In
practice the other day the big Weight
man hurled the hammer 1'27 Ieet and
vhas been throwing near that distance
since. 1112 lsimproring his Form and
there i a general feeling that he
.sllould tilke the event. Conauay
should take the sliotput.

\Villillms is counted upon to at least
take second in the broad jump. Stock»
him has cleared the bar in the high
jumpiover 6 feet 5 inches several times
or late and the dopesters ab Drake
Sily that he Should be able to take a.

third, at least, Saturday.

Drake also has hopes in the relays,
but is not counting on either of them.
She also claims the pole vault."

Arrangements have been made with
the Rock Island management where
by it rate 01' one dollar and ﬁfty Cents

vided that the management of the

the siﬂnature of all intending to go to
Des Moines. The prospects are good
iorsecuring the required numberor
names A special train made up at

9:20 Saturday morning and reach Des
Moines about 10:30. Returning it Will

several surprises. Ida Grove ran
away with the meet with West Des
Monies second, East Dos Moincs third,
Sioux Ciiyioui-tli and Grinnell iii'th
Withs points. Turner won all those
points, tirklntzseoond.ln the 220 and
iii-st in the discus. One of the Sink
prises of the arternoon was the dercat

'01' East Des Momes high by West high

by about 2 points. M‘rlxﬁeld, Malcom’s
jumper, tied Icr iirst in the high jump
at :3 feet 61 inches The best records
given were in the mile, ill which Cook
of independence lwns credited with
11:43 and in the 440 Where Gates of
West Des Hollies was glven 51 273 sec.
Those who saw Llle meet believe that
the timing was much too last. There
was considerable complaint about the
poor Condition ()1 the track. Tile con-
trol 01 the meet was put in the hands
of the Superintentenrs‘ Committee
appointed by the State Tenollcrs’ As-
sociatioll last year of which Supt.
Thornbul‘g of this city is chairman
and the Superintendents from Sioux
City and Dubuque the other members.
They will ﬁx the location of the meet
during the meeting of the Stu. t e
Teachers’ Association next winter.
Drake [or Des Moines, Iowa Univers-
ity for Iowa City and Iowa College
for this city will be after the location.

 

WlTl-r THE TRACK TEAM.

Grlsnell's Man Uilu:l<y During Lasl
Week-Eniries For State Meet,
~Drake Seems Sltong.

The Iowa college track team is‘ now
rounding out a period 01' exceptionally
linrd training with aday or two or
rest, in preparation for a State Meet
that promises to be one of the closest
and most interesting in years, and one
in which, unless all signs rail, Grinnell
should linish somewhere near the top.
Especially in the weighbeveuts should
the contests prove interesting, for s
fare to say that never in the history
or the I. I. A. A. have Iowa colleges
brought rorth such a wealth or mater-
ial. 1n McKedn Grimlell has a man
who wouldordinarily have been good
for three ﬁrm, but this year he can be
counted with certainty ror little more
than places.

Newspaper (lopesters over the
state have been hedging a little in the
last week, conceding that Drake has
considerably improved. and that Iowa
may not show up so well as crpccted.
Coach Eisner would attempt no fore-
cast, out his estimate of this condi-
tion or our team was slightly tinged
with blue. low has been troubled
with a ruptured muscle since the
Missouri Meet and has done no hard
work over the hurdles this week,
With this injury his chances in the
low hurdles are necessarily poor. nolr,
another man depended upon ior points
is sudering from a lame back which
interferes with his starting, though it
is hoped not seriously. “client: has
done better in the hammer this week
than ever belo're, yet he is not booked
for better than a third at the State.
Holvevel‘thnnell's chances are con»
siderably better than they have been
l'or two or three years and while the
most enthusiastic hardly hope for bet~
tertlian third, surprises will be the
order or the day and the winnerin the
dilferellt events cannot he foretold.

The rest or the team IS in the best
or shape and ready to do its best
next Saturday.

IOWA INSTITUTE OF THEOLOGY.

Ministers Men for Fourth Time in Cal-h
icrence or GrillnellﬁDean Ecs-
worih Speaks Friday.

Yesterday morning at 9:15 the Iowa
institute of Theology convened at Dr.

Steiner’s mom in the new library.

From present indications this will be
the most errectire Institute ever held.
The committee was fortunate in se-
curing Prof, E 1. Bosworth, Dean of
the Oberlin Theological Seminary,
who will give twelve lectures on the
Pauline Theology, as presented in the
sludyol the Epistles to the Galatious
and Colossians and the iirst Epistle to
the Thessalonians.

Six lectures on the Messages of the
Prophets will be given by Prof. E. A. ‘
Steiner and in addition to this he is
holding a Ilomiletlcol conference this
afternoon. His regular classes are
also open to all members or the Insti-
tute.

Two other proressors of our college
will also address the Institute; Pro‘
fessor Jesse Macy will give three lec-
tures on the Relation of Religion to
the Formation of the State, and Pro-
Iessor .i. D. Stoops will give three lec-
tures on philosophical subjects.

The Institute is open to all who
wish to take advantage of its privi-
leges and no student can mom to miss
hearing men like Dean Bosvvorth, who
will be with us all the week.
