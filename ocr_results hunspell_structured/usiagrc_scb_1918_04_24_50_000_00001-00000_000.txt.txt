The ﬁrst program of Gl‘lllllell‘s eigh»
teeiith nrusic lestival will be given by
Rudolph Ganz, \\ h some songs by

s Currie, Saturday cleiiing at eight
oclcclt, Giulz has played in Grinncll
several times, and is easily the tarot-rte
with our audiences or all the great
pianists llho lla'c played here. In atl-
dition to complete mastery of the
piano, prolound musicianship, and
breadth or emotional command. Gaiiv
has a vigorous, alert, and winning per--
sonality, which brings his audiences
immediately- ilito a more conﬁdential
atmosphere with the man and his play-
ing than is usually ielt with pianists.
Yet he has the poise and dignity, both
iii his interpretations and manner, that
are needed to qualify him as one of the
firstthree pianists of the present day.

Mr. Ganz is a native and citizen oi
Switzerland, and has served in the
Swiss army. His program for Satur-
day evening offers-us an abundance of
his best and mos brilliant achieve»
merits. Opening with a group or seven
Chopin numbers, he uses MacDowell's
Sonata Erorca as the big number ‘of
his program, following it by a grolip
ol seven pieces, containing several
novelties, lrom Gﬂtuados, Ravel, Scott
(presumably Cyril Scott, on English»

Liszt, null one ot his {mu com»
positions. Gaiic's ietlirn to Grinnell is
a great event in itsell, and he will on»
doubtedly- be greeted by stich an vzte
tion as very low artists have received
at our hands. iliss Currie will

“’Noi‘ltVs Debt to Chivalry” 15
Subject of First Lecture on
"Romance cf Chivalry”

“THE SONG 0F ROLAND” IS
TH E EVENING SUBJECT

Professor Says That Great Liter-
ature Is the Expression of
Nat‘ 1 Life

The immense debt the world owes to
(:liilalry was the theme or Dr, l\ H,
Schollcltl, llalvaitl exchange professor,
in the lirst ot‘ h‘ l‘olir lectures on ”The
Romance of Ch all-y," yesterday in
chapel. '

“Chivalry came into the world in the
cl enth century," Professor Schoﬁeld
said, “It has had an important innu»
mice in the development of humanity.
The keynote or chivalry is service
Every side of it is sci-v 0, Service to
your worldly master, service to your
lady, anti service to your God, were the
three keynotes of chivalry in the me-
diacval ages. Chivalry was an insti-
tution. It is now an ideal,"

(Fit-11mins Are Illlrllluiilus

Ger-many never had an‘age or only»
city, he pointed out. Today, as in the
past, the Germans-must he called bar-
barians. They are violating the tenets
of chivalry. They are faithless in their
word, cruel to their prisoners. and av~
ariciolls and greedy.

The ideals ofﬁhivali‘y are old, but
there is now a new opportunity to‘ e e
press these'ideals. chivalry has trans—y
l'oriiied war. The early crusaders were
cruel and ferocious. They did things
that no one of us would do. But some
thing new and transforming has en-
tci-cd the minds of men, it has soft—
eiicd the hearts 01 men without softeue
ing their manly vigor. Religion has
been greatly developed by chivalry.
Olir pl'esonhday conceptions of gallan-
try ate tltic Lo the ideals brought in
in the clcventh century.

Literature represents the very soul
of a nation; it is the conscience of a
nation. we are now following the e};-
ainplcs or the kn' his and ladies of
ancient times.- II we are today striv-
ng for high standards, it is this to

‘chivalry,

Lillltls Sen-l Flag

Speaking oi Grinuell's sci-vice dag,
Dl' Schoneld said, “I glory in the loot
llli it is covered with stars, If this
institution did not develop the ideal at
service that would eagerly jump at the
call ot chivalry, thc call or the weak
and oppressed, what sort 01‘ an lllstle
tutiou \ olild this he? I would rather-
have this institlitioii go than have it
hrced the kind or mail however- bright
he may he wl tecls .io res alise to

tiag s a u lies to your t-liivalr It
is a glory you will ﬁnd hard to sur-
