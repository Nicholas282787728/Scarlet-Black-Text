The longer-waited pnhlishiné
of the Meese Colnlnis n‘s Re-
port on Porno raplly ln Julie
1986, which too over a year to
compile and cost $500,000, was
championed by some religious
and anti-porn groups as a bench-
mark in their struggle to ban
pornography. The lteport linked
violent crimes against women
with the depiction of violent
sexual acts in porn magazines
and movies. In response to
an upsurge in anti~pornogrnphy
demonstrations, some national
convenience stores, most iro-
tably 7~Eleven, pulled Plays
boy and Penthouse from their
shelves.

More than a year after its
piihlisliin , the Report appears
to have irad little errect upon
the porn business; revenues from
pornographic iilnis, video cas-
settes, and magazines exceeded
358 billion last year. Although
Grinnell is hardly a hotbed
OiIornogl’Apliy, X-rated videos
on softvcore pornogra hicinag-
gzines are easily 0 tainable.
And. like tlle tussle of opinions
being contested on the national
level, tlle pros and cons of the
porn argument exist in the town.

Although these (irlnnell busi—

John Boatiiian ol‘ the American
Baptist Church also considers
pornography in oriniiell “a real
roblem. It is a growing thing."

oatrnan added that pornogra-
phy is “a sign of the moral de-
: y prevalent in our society to-
day, and said the church should
“stand ror absolute values...and
ncourage constituents to mom-

tor their own lifestyles to avoid
it [porn].“
“I would hire to see pornog—

Church. Although Farrell calls
pornography an issue inevitably
“left up to the individual," he
iays the Church’s role is to spealr
against it. “You have to put
good thin s in the place or the
bad. You liave to educate pee Is
to what good literature is. he
Church’s role is to promote the
good," he says,

in Griniiell, she says, “on the
whole scale or pornography, it
would be very tame here. it is
a lot easier to have,..connnunity
standards that function to keep
people in a stricter line." She
added, however, that “people
in Grinnell aren't any dilierent
than anywhere else,“ and cone
inunity standards have little rel.

porn. “It's Ruse of orii] Just not

,Welcome to the scarlet and
Black‘s new {ushion column.
This is the ﬁrst ofa series of ar-
ticles, and here is an overview
or rutnre topics to be covered. l
believe that fashion (be itin ref-
erence to clothing, hairstyle, or
whatever] tends to bring out the
characteristics of a person that
one might not notice while hav-
ing a basic conversation or by
just chatting with a few friends.

in my opinion, clothing of»

,.ten indicates what type or a

mood a person is in at a par-
ticular time. ln my own case,
on days when I am not in the
best of spirits I tend to wear ba.
sic dark colors, especially black
whereas on a ood day l ten

to wear very citeerrul, exciting,
bright clothing But clothing
can tell a lot more about a per-
son than just his mood. it can
tell where a person is troin (cg.
another country), as well as his
personal characteristics. Cloth-
ing can also be thought oras a
means of self-expression. People
who have a hard time express-
ing themselves in n written or
oral fashion can use clothingas a
means at venting their creativity
and individuality.

Being fashionable or dressln ‘
fashion does not require tiat
you spend $500 on a shirt or
a pair or pants. it also does
not require that you wear only
clothes designed by the best
French, Italian, or American de~
signers. Any article or clothing
that you wear is a “ iece otrnsh-
ion." Careful coor inalion ran

it takes is a little bit of creativ-

not only give lashion sugges—
tlons, but also explore new styles
that .arrive in the United States
from major fashion ca itals such
as Paris, examine tle history
of different articles of clothing
(such as friendship bracelets),
