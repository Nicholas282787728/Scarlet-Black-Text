(By Frank B. npplcby, ~10.)

FT. SNELLING, MINN., 12th 00.,
ilay 17, 1917.~“Gl'eater improve-
ment in two days with these stu—
dents than in two weeks with reg—
ular army recruits," is the way one
instructor described the progress
the wouldrbc officers have made
during the first iew days at Ft.
snelling, where twenty Crinnell
men, faculty members, alumni,
students, and er-students are now
in training. ,

This unusual aptitude to the
strenuous demands of army life is
attributed to the fact that sixty per
cent of the.meo have had military
training and the others are all col—
lege men and were picked for supr
posed superior ability‘.

.Although the Grinnell men have
had little or no military drill, they

are showing up cl'editably and nor
quil’iug knowledge of army techni—

que rapidly. “At least, we do not
have anything to unleam," has been
an encouraging expression in the
Gl'lnllell bunch.

Physically they are as fit and
hardened as the rest. And, believe
us, being able 'to stand this work
physically is some “Help!”

Here’s the routine that causes
sore shoulders, tender feet, and
tired muscles from head to toe:
First call, 5:15 a. in., roll call, 5:-
so, setting-up e1. rcises, 5:40-5:55,
breakfast, 6:15. At seven o’clock
the hard grind of the day begins
with squad drill,. (squad composed
of seven men and corporal), sema-
phore practice (flag signalling) for
an hour‘, company drill, and a ﬁve
mile hike with packs and guns The
hour before noon is spent in “con—
fereuce," similar to a college class
hour, during which the captain, as
instructor, lectures on some phase
of military tactics.

One can lie down or recline at
his pleasure during that time, but
fear of a sharp “Attention!" keeps
his- sleepy eye to the front.

Noon mess is 12:30 and the af-
ternoon starts with work by squads
at 1:30. From then until 4:30 or
5:00 the men are kept hard at work
on handling of the ninernound
Springﬁeld rifle, learning its parts,
sighting and firing exercises. Fiver
forty-live brings retreat, the salute
as the colors are lowered and the
“chess” event of the day. t‘dess is
at 6:05 and study hours are from
seven until nine. Lights are out
at 9:15 in the squad rooms, and
taps, “the end of a perfect day,"
sound at 11:00. '

Twenty-ﬁve hundred men are now
in camp, fifteen companies of from
140 to 170 men each. The first
oi the week they were “rookies,"
arriving in cltizeus' clothing, silk
shirts, Stetson hats, stylish made-
turmeasure suits — today they are
rapidly becoming the future officers
of "the first hundred thousand, —
white collars discarded for three
months, perhaps forever, now dress
ed in big, broad army shoes, heavy
woolen socks, canvas leggings, kha-
ki bl'cechcs and packet, woolen
shirt and broad hrimmed hat.

The following weeks will bring
a much greater change. Each man
in turn is corporal of his squad,
and later sergeant for a day, Great

Wednesday Evening in

Sanity of thought, economy of

the dominant appeal of the girls'
Patriotic kally, held Wednesday
evening in the auditorium of
Alumni Hall, under the auspices of
the Y. W. c. A.

Interesting Talks Given.

The meeting was called for the
purpose of generating patriotism
among the women of the college,
and to determining in what this
patriotism should conslst. inter-
esting talks were given to the hun-
dred and ﬁfty girls present by Prof.
Bailey, Miss Luella Itead, Ruth Wil»
son, and Miss Edith Helmer.

professor Bailey, speaking on the
most subject, “What Women Should
Do in the Van'," maintained that
the most essential thing for col-
lege girls is to do what they, as
students, have to do, and thus live
more fully. He held the view that
very few women will be called to
do more than they have been do-
ing in the past.

Miss Read Speaks.

Miss Read read a body of roses
lutlons for college girls, drawn up
at the recent meeting of the Ameri-
can Collegiate Association in Wash—
ington, in which the emphatic notc
was physical emcieucy and ecolmr
nomical living.

In a discussion or the Eight
Weeks Club, from the point of view
of patriotism, Ruth Wilson told of
the signiﬁcant service that could
be rendered by undertaking the
leadership of younger girls, and
preparing them mentally and phyr
sically for the work of the present
day.

Urges Quiet Tlunkiug,

Miss Helmer, the Student Sec-
retary of the North central ﬁeld
of the Y. W. C.A ., urged steady.
sane, and quiet thought until the
Women's mission is clearly outr
lined, and, speaking from a per-
sonal viewpint, declared that her
patriotism mcant ‘just doing every~
day work in a better way.”

A patriotic pledge was suggested
for adoption, and the women of the
college will be given an opportu-
nity to signify their willingness to
scrvc their dag, by signing this
pledge. ,

MAY ESTABLISH RED

Attempt Being Made to Secure

Students—Di: Sprnglle Advis-
es Men to Finish College
Course First.

The establishment of a Red Cross
Training Detachment in Grinnell
next fall-for thc men and women of
the college, is being seriously con-
sidered by the faculty and local
chapter of that organization, accord
ing to a statement by Dr. J. P.
Sprague, of the Department of Phy-
sical Education, last night. An at-
tempt will be made to secure tcde-
icl super-vision of the course, but if
this is found to be impossible, the
matter will be put in charge of the
local authorities. Arrangements may
also be made to include citizens of
Gi-inpell in the venture,

To Consist of First Aid work.

The obiects of the organization
will be to materially enlarge the
work now being undertaken by the
women's training class of the col—
lege, and to give a more practical
and thorough course in the care of
[the wounded on the field of battle
land in the unit and base hospitals.
it will consist largely of first aid
work.

When asked conccrning the advis-
ability oi enlistment in some branch
of the national service, Dr. Spraguc
stated very emphatically that all un-
dergraduates should plan to Comr
plcte their college courses before
joining the army or navy. By- dor
ing this, he pointed out, they would
hc far better fitted to serve their
country than at prescnt, for unedr
ucaled men can be secured by the
score, while tl‘iliued men are always
in great demand. This applies even
more to men who intend to enter
the professions.

Should Be Careful in Choice.

However, it the college mcu feel
it their duty to volunteer, they
should be careful to choose the
branch of the sci-vice for which they
are best fitted. The branches of
the navy now open to enlistment
include the Submarine service. Ma-
rines, Coast Patrol, Medical Corps,
and regular navy; those of the army
are the infantry, cavalry, light and
heavy artillery, the cuginering, iwlar
tion, hospital, and quarter-masters
corps.

Hoyt Blily Set New State Record in

The Dashes.-

With four men out of six picked
for the finals in the 100, two in the
220, two in the 440, and one in
the 220 hurdles Grihnell’s pros-
pects in the state Mect at Drake

yesterday afternoon and left Grin—

dashes and hul-dlcs, Andes six, Cor-
nell 3, Coe two, Iowa two, High-
land Park two, Parsons two, simp-
son one, state Teachers- one and
Morningside one.

Place Four in limited.

Hoyt took fllst place in his heats
of the 100, 200 and the 220 hurd»
is: in easy time. Fielding ran sec-
ond to Hoyt in his heat of the 100,
while Bartlen and Darrow galloped
in for second and third behind Wy-
ldud of Iowa in the other bent.
Darrow pulled a second out of his
heat in the 220 behind Gena of
Highland Park. Van Born and Ear-
den ehch won his heat of the our
tor. ' i

Wyland of lowa seems to be the
only trump out against the possi~
bihty of Gl‘l‘nnell's repeating her
grand slam in the 100 made at the
Conference meet, as he broke the
tape in 10 275 ahead ’of the two
Grinnell sprinters.

With favorable conditions Hoyt
seems to be prepared to demolish
Lighter's state record of 25 2-5 in
the low hurdles as he did his Con-
ference record a week ago. Massey
won first in the second heat of the
low hurdles and should offer the
scarlet and black sprinter the Dark
essnry competition.

Gi'innell Strong in Relays.

The showing in the dash preli-
minaries should give Grinnell the
best chance in the bitllrlllile relay,
and dopesters are figuring that the
Maltese Crossbas a chance to snap
the tape In the long event, Bar-den
seems to be booked for a place in
the 220, though he has stitf coni-
petition in Gena of Highland Park
and Wyland of lowa. Gl‘iuuell can-
not figure on a point in the field
events. Sprinkle and Mchl'cgor
should count in the long runs.

With a fast track and ideal
weather the meet should be one of
the best in years, and prospects
seem good that several new records
may be hung up.
