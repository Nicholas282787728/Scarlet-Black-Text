Departments face off in Trivial Pursuit

m’JAI GANG

Academics at Giiuuell are typically kept collegial, but this
Monday, all that will change. “In the bowels of the JRC, thele
will be an epic battle of the minds consisting of each major
going head-to-heid," said john Burrows
'10, who plans to coinpero for the sociology
department’s team, “Whoever draws ﬁrst
blood wins.m

On Monday April 21 at 7 p.m. the an-
nual inrer departmental Trivial Pursuit tour-
nament will commence in Lyle's pub. The
event brings together both proressors and
snidents as they compete against other departments in a (our
test of obscure facts.

This will be the first year in recent memory that itcr doe
partmental Trivial Pursuit will he held in one location. “The
way they usually did it was that the Vice President would
create the bracket and [the departments] would play when they
had time,”si\id Eric Olson ’08, who. as SGA Vice President for
Academic Affairs, is in charge orcoordinaring the event. “But
this year we’re getting rid orrhe bracket system and having evr
cryone play at the same time."

The event is open to all those students who have declared
a niajoi, and any major may compete as long as there is one
member present. Undeclared students are not allowed to comr
pete. In the past, there have typically been between 20 and so
participants.

Departments may establish their teams ahead of time or
form them ad hoc with whatever students are present. The
teams that win Monday’s round one will then advance to com»
pete in round two that will take place Thursday in the pub,
While there are no tangible awards up for
grabs, whichever department ultimately wins
will have bragging rights for an entire year.

Departments from all three disciplines
will be competing. “We are going to comr
pete." said Ian Lunderskov '08. “We plan to
be very competitive, however, we are a little
scared because I heard History plans on
br‘ ginga ringer,"

Ed Cohn, History. was a proliﬁc quizbowl player in high
school. and, according to it list on the online Qiizbowl Re:
source Center, was the 38th best competitor or all time.

In the last few years, the competition has been dominated
by the History department. supers ‘Trivial Pursuit players
such as Sarah Purcell ’92 and Victoria Brown, both Histoiy,
have successfully led their department to numerous victories.
This year, however, the department will be without both, as
Purcell is on sabbatical and Brown’s daughter just gave birth.

Members or other departments said were ieady to eapit —
no on their absence planned to compete well. “This year there
is going to be a revolution,” said Burrows. “Plus, no one likes
History anyways."

Bat in dorm leads to policy change

BY OMAR MUNOZ
ReSidents ofCleveland Hall were dismayed earlier this year
by mice scurrying about their dorm rooms. Unfortunately, resir
dents of another south campus dorm encountered ‘ianil'lel'i
potentially more dangcr0u57unwanted vrsitor: a bat.

While bars regularly appear in the
dorms, this incident led security to change
its policy on bats to better protect student
health.

on Sunday morning a bat ﬂying in a
doim room in Read Hall was eventually
caught and released by a security officer.

Zoe Leas '1o,who lives in the two-room
triple where the bat was found, said that the
bar was in their room for some time but was
not discovered until it appeared in the hallway, “A girl on our
ﬂoor found it in the hallway," she said,“She was scared because
it may have had rabies so she called security. We don’t know
how long it was in our room."

It appeared that the bat had been present in the room rot

for many nights having potentially bitten the girls in their
sleep.

The three students said that because of Security's proce
dure they now have had to contend with the possibility of be
ing infected with rabies. “It would have been
nice if the bat would have been tested," said
Leas. “We would have avoided trouble with
the Health Department,"

Leas and Dagcnais both contacted their
doctors who rccominended that they get vaer
cinated for rabies. “My roommate Zoe [talked
to] a persOn from the state health department
and she was the One who said that the but
could have bitten us in our sleep without us
knowing," said Dagenais. “She said that although it was unr
likely that this happened and that we had contracted rabies. it
was a possibility and therefore she strongly recommended the
vaccination."
