Help co—op grow

To the Editor:

Since last spring, a handful of
students have been trying to
organize a food coop ln Grinnell
with the hope of eventually exr
pandlng to meet the needs of
townspeople as well as students.
This semester the Gl‘innell Food
Buying Club finally got on the road
but may be headed toward a dead
end. Although several successful
orders were made, the future of the
buying Club now looks doubtful,
This may be the result of a few
misconceptions concerning the
organization and function of a co-

op.

There is no such thing as a
Chairman or head of a co-op. A“ car
op members are expected to don
lively participate in the Coop's
Iunctions and responsibilities.
Members are expected to volun-
teer for action as well as to be
initiators and leaders. It seems to
me that the collegeowned co-ops
interpret the Grinnell Food Buying
Club as a service that is being
ireely provided tor their use. This
is not the case, however, and it is

this attitude that is preventing the
successful and smooth operation oi
the coop

in an intense academic en-
vironrrient such as Grinncll.
starting an organization such as
the lood coop is extremely difr
ficult, But the fact that it is a
cooperative should be a con»
solation in that no one person has to
carry the burden, liall members ol
the co-op do, in tact, cooperate, i
think it will involve less personal
time and eilort than it may seem,
and may serve to be a source oi
persona] fulfillment as well. There
are many oiieampus and oil-
board students who would benefit
by participating in the coop, not to
mention college laculty and staff
who would also benefit by pur-
chasing lowerrpriced. high quality,
and bulk foods.

We need input, volunteers, en.
thusiasm and cooperation. If you
would like to see the Grinnell Food
Buying club live and grow, feed it,
because it’s slarving!—-Robin

To the Editor:

Tucked in a corner of the issue of
October 31 was disturbing news
indeed from Ms. Greeanrim. She
faces diilicull housing decisions for
1976-1977 She lists our alterr
natives. either close college houses
next to the campus, or force
students who plan to live in private
quarters next year to move on
campus.

Now, what is bad' the college
looses molley, for it does not till its
halls. In the ’50’s, Grinnell decided
to expand, build, and acquire new
housing, Enrollment slipped,
however, as the trends reversed.
The student boom which was so
vigorous now grinds to a stand-
still.

Ms. Green Crim refuses to see
the issue in its larger context, To
her, students living independently
in Grinnell represent a rich source
ior filling dormitories and quotas.
The trick is to get them on campus.
The students show no signs or
returning oi their oivn accord.
”With a lower enrollment, there is
less need to have students off-
campus," she reasons, “yet the

number has increased."

it was not a large enrollment
which prompted students to move
into the town, but rather greater
Ireedom oi lifestyle. What is up-
setting about Ms, Green-Crim's

could dictate a policy which would
force all students to move back on

campus. but the college has no
business in controlling students in
such a way. Perhaps this year’s
freshmen, and certainly all
students whose parents so indicate,
should live on campus. Alter-
