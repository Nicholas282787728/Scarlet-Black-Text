IO‘lA “ILL FIGill’l‘.
During the week Iowa enthusiasts,
have gradual . conic to believe that
the Grinnell game is to be a hard one.
Day by day football "pep” in the Uni—
versity town has grown until now it is
pretty much at trill ebb.
oiic evidence of this was the big;
mass meeting held in Iowa City last
night. Before the Cornell game of r.
week ago such an occurrence wasi
thought urineccssarw. But now it is,
different. The announcement of the,
meeting in the Uni Iowan was head-
ed, “Grinncll Honored BV Mass Meet—l

“What's iii Your Room?" was the
subject discussed by I. B. MacGl‘egol‘
at Y. M. c. A. last Thursday evening.

.uacGrcgor first pointed out the im-
portance of the window in a fellow’:
room, how it furnished air and light,
and how it was the arcnuc through
which be viewed the outside world.
The importance of the pictures and
pennants was next taken up.

According to llacoregor the big
thing in college life was fellowship
with oiic's roommate The final point
which the speaker madc was in re- .
gard to cleanliness. He pointed out
how a clean, neat and tidy room was
a, place of comfort and an index at the
character of the inhabitant.

The speech was closed by the sig-
iiiticant statement that from the view-
point of ideal rooms "Men's dorms
would he the biggcst thing in years
for Grinncli."
