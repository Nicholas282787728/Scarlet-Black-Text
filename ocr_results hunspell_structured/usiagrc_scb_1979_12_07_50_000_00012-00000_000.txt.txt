“Thanks, Babe,” he call€d to her
over his shoulder on his way out the
door, “I think I‘m on to something ”

He headed immediately [or the
YMCA, wondering just what he meant
by his last remark, and wondering
what in the hell that business with the
clamrl‘illed bathtub had meant; to her,
to him, and to the authors. Strange
stuff was coming down and it just
didn’t fit.

Captain Stribling had been born
near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, some
50 years back, On his [ilth birthday,
he had sat in church scratching
himself restlessly as he watched his
parents being joined in matrimony.
Shortly after that, he was traded to a
passing Japanese whale boat as a
cabin boy for so yen and two bottles of
hair oil. Alter two years at menial ser-

he was granted commission in the
Japanese Merchant Marine and given
the designation suo:
(shittyvlittle-jobs-officer).

At age 25, after an incident in which
he beat a sperm whale to death with
the captain ot his ship, he was given
his walking, or rather swimming,
papers 30 miles off the coast of
Borneo. He made it to shore, and
spent the next six months living with a
large female Orang-Utan, who taught
him everything he knew about In-
donesia: a pitiful handful of facts
mostly involving tender bark and
plant shoots. After his rescue by some
archeologists, whom he had a very dire
{icult time convincing that he was not
some iorm of early man that had hap
pened to iorego thousands of years oi
evolution, he spent the next ten years
of his life travelling from one
disreputable Waterfront bar/bordello
to another. Finally, in Madame

found they shared a taste [or the same

and before the evening was over, he
had landed the captaincy oi Haddock~

deader than Archibald Cox, the stulted

his own, kept it with him at all times,

Well, anyway, the grisly tableau
that greeted Cecil as he stood in the
center at the ransacked room was
this: the place was knee deep in shat-
tered smrlish, all the paint had been
scorched lrom the walls, and the Cap»
tam was slumped in an old easy chair,
which couldn't possibly have been
there, since the authors just decided
that the entire building had been raz»

somebody, or something, of immense
strength, had inserted a large squid,

out loud. “Not bloody likely,” is the
reply that rirst comes into Torn
Johnson's mind. If (and this would
astonlsh us) there is anyone interested
in hearing what eventually happened
to our hero, we don’t care to know
about it, thank you. Scar/6' & Wk,
