LOYALTY.

Luyalty has been the keynote of
the football season that has ended
\Ilth today's game lIiLll Cornell. Loy
alty of both the men of the team and

the students and [acuity cf the 0017
lege.

Number 18.

As We review the situation, we
can see many good points and a few
errors in the past. As we look into
the future, we See nothing but hope
and success. The men oi the team
have worked hard and have achieved
remarkable results under the leadew
ship of captain Don Parker, and [he
tutelage or Cuach “Buddy” SaundeIs.
Some Df the men have taught their
last gridiron battle for Old Gl‘innell
and others will agaIn don the “lily
form next fall. Tu all. we extend our
appreciation for the sacrifices that
they have made and for victories that
they have won, thl'u their loyalty.
Now, with the conclusion or the
foothill season, comes another ODDOJ'V
tunity iorthe unilicd backing and
loyal support of all ariuncllians.
The basketball season is opcnIng
up and the Pioneers are confronted
by an exceedingly stiff schedule. An
abundance of material is showing “17

for daily practice and there seems to

 

teammates and their united efforts
for tho gratiﬁcation of his own ambi»
tion. All must cooperate and subor—
dinate personal aims ior complete
success.

This doctrine of cooperation applies
not only to football but to every other
attivity. He who makes wondellul
sains nod establishes nu enviable rep—
utntion does 56 ﬁlm the efforts of his
friends as well as thI-II his own ca—
pabilities and efforts. l'le Whu seeks
elevation without in turn hiding his
friends is as great ll detriment to
himself and the school as the individ-
ual football star. Both create face
tiohs and disturbance.

True, there are usually (actions and
factional strife in any body regard-
less of the composition of those bod-
les, and the characteristics B? the ins
dividuals and aims involved. LaclI of
cooperation and violent opposition
does not depend on individual selfislr
ness alone, nor even on group selfishe
ness, althcl the latter is more often the
case.
in every student body, in every or.
gallization, in every group, there is a
tendency for the elevation of a few
who seem outstanding leaders. it is
both natural and right that those who
show BXCGptional ability, or excepr
should

also to be expected that those who are
unwilling to make the necessary sac-
‘ ces of time and energy should
sacrifce any tendency for idle or un-
rounded criticism and cooperate with

those who are Working for the group.

selfishness may be shown as vividly

in unwillingness to work as in grasps
ing for honors, and it behooves us to
avoid both extremes if we wish to at»
tain the best results,

Elton member of the group has as '
definite a. function to perform as has
the football player. For success, each
man must perform his specific duties,
regardless 0! whether they be in the

work together. Each must subordir

ment or true cooperation and the
