Natural Law candidate to visit

by Christopher Fletcher

Larry Chroman, the new Natu»
ral Law party's candidate for this
dictrict’s Congressional seat, will be
speakingnextWednesday,0ct.7at7
pm in North Lounge. Chromas is
challenging incumbent Republican
Jim Ross Lightfoot and Democrat
Elaine Baxter.

Chroman’ party, which was
founded April 20 in Fairlield, Iowa,
intends to “bring the light of science
into politicsito take field-tested
approaches and put them to use im-
mediately to solve America’s prob4
lems." The Natural Law party’s pro-
gramemphasizespreventionandedu-
cation as the best solutions to the
nation‘s problems.

Chroman believes that the two-
party gridlock in Washington must
be broken if real solutions to the
looming problems of our day are to
be implemented. “Government re-
ally isn’t answering the problems of
our times." The Natural Law party,
saidChroman is nowthefastestgrow~
ingpoliticalpany in theUnitedStates,
with a field of over one hundred
candidates running for office in sev-
eral states. The party's presidential
candidate, Harvard-trained physicist
John Hagelin, is on the ballot in 28

statm and might be on the ballots in
35 by November.

Chroman‘s brother~in-law,
Stuart Zimmerman is challenging
incumbent Republican Chuck
Grassley and Democrat lean Lloyd-
Jones for Iowa‘s US. Senate seat
Their party, according to Chroman,
has scientiﬁcally validated solutions
to national problems like health care
reform. crimes and drug use. They
also emphasize heavily reform in
education and elimination of the na-
tional debt.

The Natural Law party’s pro-
gram for health care reform may
sound rather simplistic at first. They
suggest that people just not get so
sick, Chroman faults our current
health care system for emphasizing
treatmentratherthan prevention.and
he faults our political system for be—
ing to closely tied to special interests
like the insurance and pharmaceuti-
cal companies. Eliminating the PAC
money from Washington and em-
phasizing prevention, Chroman says,
would lower the cost of health care
and improve the health of the nation.
Chroman says that a new emphasis
on diet, nutrition, and safety would
spare our health. He would also like
to see regulation on medicine relaxed
so that more natural medicine could

be available to people.

The Natural Law pany‘s pro
gram sounds in part almost like a
combination of Democratic party
concern for the social good and a
Libertarian sense of fiscal responsi-
bility, On tackling the federaldeﬁcit,
Chroman believes that as much as
half of out federal health care expen-
diture could be cut, and that money
couldbe used againstthedebr. Waste
in education and other government
programs could also be sharply cure
tailed, he says. By trimming hun»
dreds of billions of dollars in govem-
ment waste, Chroman says that the
country could balance its budget.
eventually repay its debt and still
have better social services than what
it does now.

The party goes one step further:
they want to seriously decrease the
American tax burden. By reducing
regulation, cutting waste and imple-
mentingscientiﬁcallysoundsolulions
to problems, Chroman hopes that
government can be brought down to
a more local level and used to really
help people.

Chroman discussed the party's
stand on theabortion issue. his very
simple, he said, “Nobody likes aborr
tion.“ I-Iis party’s idea is to reduce
the number of unwanted Dregnan»

cies. hence the number of abortions.

Education, said Chroman, is the only

way to accomplish this goal. “We
cannot legislate our morality, “ he
said. Chroman said that people on
both the pro- and antirchoice sides of
the fence tendto like the Natural Law
party's position, Pro-choice advo-
catesareagainstlegislatingmorality,
whiletheiropponemsagreewith with
the general principle that the number
of abortions can and should be re~
duced somehow,

Education is the answer to the
AIDS epidemic, as well. Chroman
said. He also contends the monied
special interests in the medical in-
dustry who have so much inﬂuence
on politicians havesuppresed cenain
kinds of medical research and ex-
perimental drugs which could help
people suffering from AIDS and vari-
ous cancers. He said that this more
than anything provoked him to enter
thepolitical arenaandtry to do some-
thing to make America‘s future
brighter.

The Natural Law party has a
unique campaigning style. Accord—
ing to Chroman, they regard a
carnnpiagn as a sort of “celebration"
in whichpeoplewithgoodideascome
forth to help their country. They are

not antagonistic toward their oppo-
nents. People at Sunday's Demo-
cratic party Fall Fest last Sunday
noticed an airplane circling overhead
for a few minutes pulling a banner
that read ”The Natural Law Party
Welcomes Bill Clinton.” Chroman

German statesman concludes stay

Dr. Hans Apel, Rosenlield/
Heath Distinguished Visiting
Professor and former German
statesman delievred a talk Tuesday
evening on “European Integration:
Dreams and Realities.”

Apel discussed the
implications of the recent monetary
crisis in Europe in which the British
pound crashed and Britain withdrew
from the European monetray system.
He also discussed the meaning of the

positiveFrench vote on the Maastricht
Treaty for European community
political, economic and monetary
integration.

Apel, a former leader in
Gennany’s Social DemocraticParty,
was Minister of Finance under
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt from
1974 to l978,and Ministerof Defense
from 1978 to 1982. Apel returrts to
Germany this weekend where he will
begin his semester at the University

of Rostock in the former East

wants to do something positive to
change AmCI‘lCH. “We are not op-
posed to anybody." Chroman feels
that he and Ins colleagues are “run-
mug with them or for them," because
the Natural Law ideas “can fulfill the
goals of all parties.”

Chroman and Zimmerman inr

people who come to see them and
provide video cassette players with

Chroman says that the reaction and
support that they have already re-
ceived has been “much better than

Chromansaysthathispartytook
its lead from the British Natural Law
Party, also founded this year only
two weeks before the UK‘s April
election. The British party had sig-
niﬁcant support considering its new-
ness, though not enough to actually
win Parliamentary constiniencies.

Chroman compares this time in
American history with 1854 when a
major political recrystallization re-
sulted in the birth of the Republican
party. Said Chroman, these changes
and realignments are all part of “a
searchg for freedom and new any

Chinese
— new major

by Riva Sharples

Chinesehasrecendybecome
an ofﬁcial major at Grinnell Col-
lege. In previous years, students
wishing to major in Chinese had
to do it as an independent major.
ThepreviousChinesemajorswere
required to do a four-credit senior
thesis. and had to have two advi-
sers. Beginning this year, majors
have a required senior seminar
instead of the thesis, which is ex—
pected to ease the work load for
most people.

There are twelvestudean ma-
joring in Chinese at Grinnel, and
Five of them (all juniors) are in
China this semester. In addition
to the major, new courses in Chi-
nese have also been added to
Grinnell‘scurriculum."l‘hisyear,
there is a course called Classical
Chinese being offered. In the
course, students learn how reread
the language of literate Chinese
before the dropping of the exami-
nation system in 1905, All of
China‘s great htatonans and pin-
losophers wrote in this." said
Chinese Proffessor David
Keenan. "One in four people in
the world speaks Chinese, and
there are many uses foraCttinese

A new survey course, entitled
“Hellon Earth: Chineser’itings
on Chinese Society,” is being
taught this semester by Professor
Y. K. Lo. Next semester Keenan
will teach a survey course on nae
dittonal Chinese literature and
translation. The first Chinese
classes were offered at Grinnell
College in 1916. Held on Satur-
day momings in the library by a
Chinese student, the classes were
to help “those who are going to
China or who are interested in
China and Chinese literature, ac-
cording to an article in the March
8, 1916, issue of the Scarlet! and
Black. It wasn't until 1985 that
the college formally began teach-
