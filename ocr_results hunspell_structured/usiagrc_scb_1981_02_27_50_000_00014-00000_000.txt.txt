The sound of silence

‘-ln months prior to your coming to
Grinnell you must have been asked a
million times why. Why indeed? You
could say it was a good school but there
are many good schools and unless you
were particularly intrigued by the idea
at Iowa corniields as a location that
would simply not do. Most likely part ol

our reasoning went like this: Grinnell
is mall ttiny'll; I will not have to deal
with TAS or lecture halls at 500
students; I will be able to particlpa te ln
dis‘cusswn classes, That was part of
Grinnell's big push to prospectives 7
we would get personal attention. In tact
we‘ would begin in a wunderlully per-
sonal class 0112 orlS. Theoretically, we
superbly articulate ireshmen would
have a tutorial in which to "get into the
swing of things."

Perhaps it was the 8 a.m. meetlngs
but in my tutorial 1 got the same feeling
as I'd had many times in junior high.
When the prof asked a question I notic-
ed a hush similar to that at our seventh
grade class when the wimpy substitute
math teacher asked who had thrown the
teacher's edition out of the window. Un~

ly now it was worse 7 in seventh grade
we were sucking together in our
silence; here it was every man tor
himself. We would help no one. We all
knew that alter a reasonably long pause
the proi would answer his own question
anyway. probably much better than
any at us could do.

Yet even with that introduction we
did not give up our illusion oi amazing
discussion classes, ideally we want our
classes as small as possible. We come
plain when an English class exceeds 30.
The idea oi little or no lecture thrills us
no end. We undoubtedly brag to our
friends at big universities about it. One
prol this semester asked the class ll it
w anted lectures or discussion. The deci-
sion was unanimous in lavor ot discus-
sion. Lectures, we know. are boring.
But once the course has begun
everything changes, We realize that
now we must be prepared. This. at
course. is difficult. So we go to class
prepared — prepared to let others do
the talking. immediately there is a prim
blem. The classes are, you must
remember, small — as we said the

Sometimes it we are lucky"). two
tairly verbose students have examined
the same portion at the subject or work
in question. These two then proceed to
debate and the debate can go in one ot

saying the same thing in ditlerenl

starting each rebuttal with "but and
ending by saying. ”\iell. sorry, i yust

cedes, no new ideas are brought lorth
and nothing is accomplished. This
degenerates into a form at «excuse met

that we have the opportunity to have
truitless arguments with supposedly in
telligent people other than our lriends

when a prot asks a question designed
to lorce the discussion' in ti linear
rather than circular direction it tails
on deal ears. Despite all or the pretty
words we have used. despite our strong
convictions about our single points. we
discover we have really thought very
little about the Subject in question

there are classes tand even tutorialsl ill

where it occurs.

discussion classes are. in theory. the
best method or learning However. this
system cannot work by itselt. We must
make it work A discussion class minus
class discussion does not equal an
