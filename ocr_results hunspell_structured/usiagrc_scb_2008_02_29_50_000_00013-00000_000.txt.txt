duct the business oflifc in said building. Unless we are mistak-
en, no building on the college campus is older than our house
When Goodnow Hall was naught bur a glimmer in J,E. Grin-
nell's eye, the residents of our lirrle house on High street peered
out rnto verdrnt forests brimming with butronreyed woodland
creatures, unconcerned that a kegger in Soccer House would
bump on erstwhrle Bunsen brrrner in Meth House, triggering
a chain reaction that would bring the chemical apocalypse and
sterilize our grandchildren,

A simpler tirrre, perhaps, for a srmpler era. Little did we
know that while we sloggcd on into the 21st century,our house
would not be joining us,

We have no phone. n nternet, and no cenrml hearing. The
oven and bathroom taps are operated via needlcrnosed pliers.
Running water in the kirchen is dispensed only after proper
veneration to the culinary gods, whose caprices may still rendcr

you waterless. When electricrty was installed in thc1980's,lialf

the circuits were routed to an easily accessible box in the axes
murdereresque basement, while the other halfwei‘e moved to a
hidden ruse hot in a secret room recess-role only by removing a
prnel in the wall. Naturally, we drseovcred the secret fuserbot
room long after we had repeatedly electrocuted our selves tryrn g
to do home electrical repairs without turning offthe power.
The source otour most physical and immediate consternrk
rion, however, is the upstairs bathroom. If not this semestei,
then the next, the bathroom will (mark our words) physically

When one sets foot in the bathroom the ﬂoor llnlnedlLKCT
1y sinks an rnch and a hrll'. The shower curtain allows ample
wrter to cascade down the south wall, feeding civilizations of
mold who chewing their way through the cheap grouting.

only yesterday, an ominous two-toot long chasm sprang up
along the back corner, above the toilet (whose faulty bobber, inn
cideutally, keeps it in a perpetually dmrning stare). l—Ieeding the
call of nature has become a gastronomic game of Russian torr-
lette. You sit nervously knowing that every visit to this bath
room could he your last. We figure that as soon as somebody
completely fills 'the bath tub the added weight ofthe water will

The odds are roughly 20 to 1 that the residents or our house

Not complimentary and vaguely offensive awards, 2008

I've won many dubious awaids in my time.
In third grade, my Church ofEngland elemenv
rary school gave me an acnral eertifrcrte for
drawing (wait for it) the “most accurate picture
of heaven.” A few
problems: first, as
far as I know, my
third grade teach-
at was not actually
God. second, my
super “accurate"
picture of Heaven
featured dead people lying on velvet-lined cot-
ﬁns under a huge, ﬂoating, bearded free. Parn-
disc!

I also recently discovered a DARE ccr-
tifrcote naming me “most impr-ovcd"of all the
students in my ﬁfth grade DARE class. l-low
puzzling,l thought. While I certainly came out
ofthe class with a debilitrting, paranoid fear
of drugs and alcohol, I can't image that I be-
gan the class much differently Have I blocked

hood in the suburbs of Chicago? Who knows

knowing that it would bar my acceptance into

bring me, I thought I'd drstrrbute a few of

Without further

Ah, Iowa winter, everyone’s favorite feature
about Grinnell. Ifl were m charge of mar

award for Most completely Useless Against

lowr Weather structure goes to the frrsr half
of the East campus loggir. It might look like
a brrrier against wind, snow, and rain, but I
think the East campus loggin might actually be
designed to mrke your body [Cmpeml’ui‘c drop
14 de ‘ces upon entry. It makes no sense. I‘m
surprised the poles don’t have fans that blow
freezing water, but again, I’m not in charge of
this campus.

one of my favorite features of Grinnell
(end this isn't going to be surpr- lag) is the
uurntity of delta
cious and completely
chemicallytproduced
food available in the
south campus loggia.
A honey bun bigger-
than your head on the
way to your 2:15 class,
a bag of potato-chip-
like “ketchup fries"
produced by Burger King: all these and more
can be young unless the machine eats your
money

Since joining the DARE program, this
awkward boys/lke fifth grader has given
up her meth habit and managed to seture

cess. VVhat‘s that, the machine doesn't accept
lizards? No problem, I'll use cash. \Vait, it's

Gmpe Jurce from 1942? I guess 1 can live with
that. Oh, thrs isn't even g- pe juice, it's a dcad
hamster wrapped in rinioil? Well, I've never
claimed to have standards.

Enough of this depressing trlk, though,
because there are some great things about
this campus. We have academic excellence,
we have community
bonding, and mrrn, we
have some great places
to hook upl think the
winners in this catego-
ry (and I'm happy to
debate this) go to the
empty Harris crnema
(so darkl), the ﬁreplace
lounge (so comfort-
able!), and the storage room in the Pubs office
(so likely to be walked in on by seen employ-
ees!). After all, isn't that what we're all look-
ing for in the end? Not conveniently located
food, not protection from the elements, but a
cramped, norrthatrprivate place for a meeting
of the minds. It might not be the most accu»
rate picture ofheaven. but hey, it's a start.
