Quality or quantity: how we should spend

Appreciate quality over quantity

Given Grinncll's location 50 milcs from an
urban center, we are lucky to have ample ops
porrunlries to see |n0\’iBS‘i\nd attend concerts.
Both the SGA Films and Concerts commit—
tees work tirelessly to give the test ofus enter—
rtuning weekend events

But amidst the recent scuttle over bud-
get allocations, we have yet to ask whether
each group is serving the campus effectively,
\Vhen students must choose between a Friday
night of hanging out with friends or attend
ing a concert by an unknown
band, usually the concert will
be forgotten. The same goes
for the umptrcn \veckcncl film
screenings. Sure, we have a lot
of options, but rarely do we ask
ourselves, “How much is too
much? What do we value more: quantity or
quality?"

For a majority of events, sen Films and
Concerts cater to a very small group, often do

mg so far more than is necessary Lasr week-
end, SGA Films showed three movies on cam-
pus a combined 11 times, and shows another
movie twice on Wednesdays Go to any of
these events, and you'll typically rind ii sin-it
iering ofsttidenrs. Crowds are exceptions, not
the rule.

The same trend applies to concerts. A
typical weekend brings bands foreign to even
the most obsessed leader of indie blogs, and
attendance usually tops out at i few dozen,

At some poini,rhesc committees should ask
them lvcs whether the approach of"throwing
cveiytliiiig at the will and
hoping something sticks" is
theoptiinalonc. lfthcg :lis
to reach and interest as 111' y
students as possible, it might
be just as productive to fo-
cus on bringing bands that it
higher percentage of students recognize. They
need a reason not to dismiss the event as “just
another film" or "just another concert."

In die past, the events with the highest

student interest have generally been the more
expensive ones that target the masses:

Last year's Ladysmith illnck Mamhazo
concert packed Herrick Chapel, and student
interest wtbs evident long after the show ended.
Even now, reference the show to someone in
attendance, and they're quick to reminisce
about just how much they enjoyed it.

SGA Filint might not be able to pack Harv
ris Tliedter on weekends, but when it rented
out The Stimirl to show (luantum of Solace,
student demand in exceeded supply, and the
tickets were gone in a matter ofm'uiures.

If we seek an 11;!"ch and involved Commu-
nity, wt: first have [0 give people reasons to be
active and involved. But this is much come
pitted through events that will inevitably atr
tract small crowds.

By acknowledging that big names attract
more students, committees can better der
tetmine how to allocate their budgets. Ifwe
assume that most students only attend a few
events .1 year, let's make those events worth—

while.

Post hook-up etiquette: the art of calling cards

Erin McBurney ’09 discusses the merits of the sneaky post-Harris rendezvous

The concept oftlic calling card is a strange
and mysterious thing, A calling card, for the
sadly uninformed, can be either one of the
ultimate hookrup strategies or the worst miss
takes ofyout recent sexual history.

Here’s what you do—huok up with some
one and leave behind, consciously or not,
something that is clearly yours. This can be a
necklace, scarfor maybe even (ityou're bold)
underwear. Later in the day, one of you will
realize that this item is not where it's supr
posed to be and will be forced to contact the
other. This, ofcourse, forces rhe hooksup pair
to, once again, meet discreetly so as to retrieve
said item, presumably leading once again to
canoodling in a fashion similar to the night
before.

Some people use this as an actual strategy
to ensure resumed intimate contact. Others
arejust forgetful. Consider myself in the latter
category. For me, the morning after a hook-up
is already a generally awkward experience—
especially ifI’vc managed to do something (or
someone) I didn't want or plan to,

My solution, or at least the only one I’ve
come up with when sleepsdeprivcd and still
somewhat intoxicated, is to leave as quickly
and smoothly as possible. My favorite line
usually goes something like, “Uh, so, well, that
was hm urn, call me ifyou Want? or I can
call,like,you? See you around,> ,BYE!!!" You
can use iriir's worked wonders for me thus
far.

Leaving with haste and the aforemenr
tioned suave demeanor, l’ll walk home, replays

5&8 movie reviewer responds

In light of the movie review notice (scc
editors: note, page 7), 1 want to make a few
clariﬁcations.

rirsr, a colleague ofmine lmd 1 took a mow
ic-ieviewiiig class in high school in which the
way we wcic taught to w|l(C movie leviews was
to synthesize reviews written in otliel majol
publications, My teacher, Ma'am Nagar, noted
that since the movies had already been rele ed
ii few months ago and major pub - ions
published their reviews, a ‘good' rcvi , is likely
to entail some oftheir opinions, as long as we
agreed with them She also maintained that a
movie rcvicw, unlike an academic article, is an
opinion, and one is allowed to share opinions
ti-ecly.

ing the evening’s events and avoiding Contact
while prerending like it's no big deal that l'm
still wearing my Fetish costume, Most of the
time I’ll just end up waiting for my former in
timate partner to con,
tact me and then feign
surpriscb—“Oh wow,
yeah, 1 completely for-
get I even own that!
I’m so sorry can 1 get
it from you in the dining hall tonight?" Notice
the awkward? Nor only do 1 pretend like my
life is so fabulously busy that I didn't even no
tic: I’d left the necklace my grearrgrandmother
left to me, but I pick a public place in which to
exchange the goods so as to avoid any ambigu~
ously intimate situations.

l’ni continually impressed with those who
have perfected the art of calling cards, but also
weirded out. For those who consciously use
this as a strategy, is it manipulative or just abs
sertive? Do we really need to work covertly in
order to ensure future intimacy, or can we not
just openly communicate our desires to each
other?

Ar a place as sociilly awkward as Grinnell,
maybe we just can’t manage to use our words
well enough to express what we’re really thinks

mg

 

Of course, there is nothing inherently
wrong with using a language other than our
words to show continued interest, but when
does the breakdown in communication lead
to misinformation and, perhaps, even creepy

Since we're not using anyone clsc’s argUr
ments or empiiical analysrs, citations are not
necessary as long as we paraphrase and add
something new to die original review. The
Sfjb‘ staff, is part of the process, contacted
my classmate and verified this claim. on my
part,l ovcrlookcd (ht: pr s ofclarifying this
policy when l starred wr g for the sear.

So, in some of the rev ‘ I have written
tor the soul piiiphiascd ii few sentences
of New York Timur reviews I agreed with, \lsur
nlly involving the plot siiinmniy. lfl wanted
to conceal the fact that l paraphiased certain
parts of reviews (which 1 igrccd with) hum
a major publication, I would not have chosen
a ubiquitous source like T/Ju New Ymk Til/rm,
but something obscure like T/zu New Zt‘ﬂl/lm,
Hum/ti or 771: Du/bl‘ Timur, which would have

Despite my own mperiences with the call-
ing card and general awkward post-sexual en»
counters, I'm a big fan of actual verbal come
munication, It's common knowledge that fully

expressing our feelings and

thoughts, especially about

intimacy with those we wish

to further explore, can easily

lead to the demise of :t bud-

ding possibility. In fact, al-
most every time I‘ve tried the honesty card, any
potential has gone up in smoke. Nonetheless,
I persist with this path, convinced that without
the ability to be open and honest, there is little
with which to be content, Because ofthis, I’ve
learned a lot about what I want and expect
from myselfand from others.

I’m not on the righteous path, and i still
screw up plenty of times. Still, maintaining
frankness has made me much more self-aware
and cognizant ofmy wants and desires, whatl
need and what upsets me.

I’m hesiranr to sound prescriptive, and it
is certainly not my intent to create a massive
spree of breakups and abandonment on can-r
pus. But maybe it‘s time to tell your partner
you don't like it when they screw you with
their socks on. Or try and take it to the next
level with that person you keep eyeing in the
dining hall.

Leaving behind a memento for the eve-
ning’s lover can be exciting and sexy, but maybe
it shouldn’t be the only form of communicate
tion. I'd suggest using youtwordsiyou might
be pleasantly surprised, ifonly with yourself.

made tracking down the source very hard.

As such, 1 was amazed (and rhnnkt‘ul) that
after writing reviews for years, this issue was
finally brought to my attention.

In fiiture,1 hope no such regrettable miss
communication involves any othcr reviewer,
pciliaps through a clear training session of
fcrcd by rhc 5&8 that outlines all important
policies.

1 ally, I hope that rendeis understand
that this major oversight and misundcisrnnd-
ing, which I duly recognize, regret and apolo-
givt for. was the result of an activity mm was
merely an occasional hobby. and will hopefully
not affect my personal relationships with any
of them.
