Only 35 S’ruden‘ls
Sign Saiurday
For Session

All thought of a summer ses-
sion was dispelled by the col-
lege yesterday when it was
learned that only 35 students
out oi the total population of 603
had registered for the proposed
session, Pres. Samuel N. Stevens
announced today.

Of the 35 who registered, 22
were men and 13 were women
Stevens said,

The minimum number under
which the college could profitably
operate a summer school is 100
students, and the desirable hum;
her is 150, he said.

Because the registration is dis-
tributed over freshmen and seniors
it would be impossible, also, to
satisfy the academic wens of the
students, and impractical to keep
the professors here for such
small classes, he added.
