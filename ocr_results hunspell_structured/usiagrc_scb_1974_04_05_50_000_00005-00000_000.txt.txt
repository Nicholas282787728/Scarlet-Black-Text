 

Memorial in

by Bruce Green

As you may have read last week,
Alan T. Green, of the class of 1973,
was killed in a car accident March
20, love, at the age oftwentystwo.
Since there are many on campus
who are or would be interested in
the details of the accident, funeral
and other events, this column is
dedicated to filling the gap of in-
formation.

speaks out

alan had finished his second one
arter law finals that afternoon, and
had gone to a party with some law
school friends to celebrate. He had
called home, and asked for some
one to come and pick him up, since
he did not feel up to it, and the
whole rest of the family drove to
pick him up.

Alan stepped off the curb in {re
ont of a car, after leaving the
party for some fresh air, and was
struck in the head. He was taken
to Santa Monica City Hospital Em»
Ergency roam, wherehe died with-
out regaining consciousness, The
doctor attending said that he had
suffered massive brain damage.

He was buried Friday the 22nd
in a simple chapel service, Al-
though there was no graveside ser
vice, two members of the family
accompanied the casket t0 the cem-
etery.

His surviving family, which in»
clude his parents,,Terence and Ma-
rilyn Green, his sister Marty, and
his brother, this writer, are setting
up the Alan T. Green Memorial
Scholarship Fund, which will be
used to help needy students of high
academic Caliber. Torn Ackerman,
Director ofAnnual Giving, is hand—
ling the details of the fund, which
has already receivedmorethanssoo
in contributions from persons other
than family members,

Alan Green was a lover of mu-
sic, books, humanity, ideas, words,
‘ and education He had a humorous

outlook on life, which most now res
‘ member. But, in the words 0! Janet

 

lquallties he could never See in

a Pagliacci

Loar, one of the people who knew
him best around the school, he was
a classic Pagliacci figure-- theman
who was a clown to all, and privately
a lonely, oftenl bitter, sometimes
sad man who lived and died alone,
because he could never come to
grips with his own imperfections
and his own traits. His life was a
never ending struggle with his idea
of perfection, truth, and justice.
He lived in a black and white wor-
ld, and could never accept the grey-
ness of most things.

He is remembered on campus as a
great party man, and wild drinker
at the Longhorn and other places.
But he confessed to me sometime
before he died that he never really
liked parties too much, He spent
most of his free time in law school
drinking alone in bitterness over
things he had done and things he
had had done to him,

He always wanted to get marrr
icd, but, paradoxically, had never
considered himself worthy of any
girl. He was a man constantly torn
in two over his many faults, but
never knew his virtues. His integ»
rity was unquestioned, his sense oi
justice was very great, and his loy»
alty to family and friends was une
shakeable.

For those of us who remember
him, he will shine in our memory
forever as a man who was good,
honest, and true, with many good

himself. As one of the closest fr-

iends he ever had, i can say that
he will never be forgotten by any
whose lives hetouched, even for as
briefa time as one quarter, or even
one afternoon. He was truly a man
in the oldrfashioned sense of the
word, and in the strictest sense
of the term, he was gallant and
honorable.

A friend to all-‘ and sundry folk
Whose voice was strong and heart
was gay

Whose mind was keen and arm was
strong

And soul was upright, proud and
gay.

in whom injustice anger woke

and fought against the Tyrant's Sway
is lost to us, and starts a long
and weary journey on .this sad day

Rest in Peace, Alan Terence Green

This Student Coordinator's Report
is not going to outline all the
important and magnificent efforts
that have been made on students‘
behalf during the past week. It is
not concerned with anything speci~
lie, but rather, its subject is an
autopsy oiyet another year in SSA
history. Neither an apology nor an
excoriation, it is an attempt to
analyze why things go wrong with
student government at Grinnell and
hopefully, it will provide some ways
to extricate it from the morass
people believe it enjoys.

First, some observations on SGA

personnel. W
will'be biased of —
@Eh§®lliillL

course. but my
efforts at objecti ., on ,
vity will be borne ngPEWWE
out in the end. —_
The final indictment more than
offsets the positive attributes to be
cited I think.

My experiences with other Grin-
nell SGA people indicate that they
are neither lazy nor stupid. They
often come from backgrounds and
head towards futures which make
their involvements in student gov.
ernment efforts pale by comparison.
That is, I do not believe ego
gratification is where their heads
are at when they take on SGA roles.
What they seek is to bend their
sometimes considerable talents to-
wards goals they see as worthwhile.
and these are largely outside of
themselves

SGA personnel involvement is. i
think, based on a perception that
something is amiss here. There is
the sense, not often well articulated
but. nonetheless felt, that Grinnell
College lacks direction, tht we
meander from day to day. The
direction is not provided by a Dean,
who. having an extraordinary capa-
bllity at running a tight budgetry
ship. seems to apply the same effort
to the more fundamental problems
facing the College. These problems
need to be met head-on, not
transferred to other line items or
held until a thorough proposal is
brought forward by those who point
out a deficiency in some aspect oi

the College. Nor is it provided by a
President whose ability to sway
an audience seems to only come
best into play when the audience

is at least mildly predisposed.

Problems need to be 'met from a'

coherent sense of direction. not
won over by mere persuas

After two years, three albums.
and the addition of a fifth mem‘
her. the Eagles are as good as
ever ~ probably better.

Their third album, 0n the Broiler
tAsylum 7E71004) is clearly Eagr
les, but the music has branched
out a hit. The album is diverse .,
there is something for the rock
inn, the country-rock aficionado,
and the MOR crowd.

Two changes mark the group‘s
third effort. First is the addition
of Don Felder on slide guitar, lead
guitar. and mandolin. His work
adds a new depth to the music ..
its especially noticeable on ”It's A
Good Day in Hell," a country
rocker with definite single possi-
bilities. Although the sound is
Eagles, there's also hint of Nit-
Ly~Gritty Dirt Band. With tight.
editing tto conform to today's
tighter playlistst, the song could
be a smash.

On The B der is marked by a
second significant changessGlyn
Johns was not the sole producer.
Bill Szymczyk produced and eng
ineered most of the album in Los
Angelcs - and is at least partially
responsible for the addition of
Folder. .

One out that might hit the Top
40 charts without the editor's
knife is “James Dean.” It capital~
izes on both nostalgia and Jackson
Browne.

“Take It Easy" was the first
Eagles, almost exactly two years
ago. Jackson Browne penned the
song (and his. recent rendition on

the Everyman album has probably
done as much for the Eagles as it
has for Browne).

”James Dean" is his contribution
to On The Border. It catches the
frantic pace that marked Dean's
career, while retaining the smooth
kind of rock that. marks much of
the Eagles output.

“Midnight Flyer" is pure country
rock and pure delight for the ears.
Bernie Leadon's banjo work is the
highlight of the cut. Your feet just
won‘t hold still -- and if you're
planning to write a paper. be sure
that your Itypewriter isn't an
electric when this cut comes arou-
nd!

Traditional Eagles is person' 'ed
by “The Best of My Love. It's
another good bet to start on the
pop charts and cross over to the
MOR singles list. The velvet vocal
blends that mark the Eagles style
have never been more evident
than in this smooth love song.

The Eagles aren't a tremendously
innovative group. .But, the group
is versatile and has an abundant
wealth of talent. Many inﬂuences
are visible. but the group has
charted its own course, and is
sticking to it.

Perhaps they will realize group
leader Glenn Frey’s ambition. He
told an interviewer recently.
“We're looking forward to a lot of
tours and albums to come. We
want to be the Jack Benny of
rock'n roll."

0n the Border takes the Eagles a
giant step towards that goal.

iveness on an ad hoc basis.
Nor, finally, is direction
provided by faculty open toaccus
tions of their policies and personnel.
The degree to which their academic
excellence is transferred to their
more political actions in the College
governance structure has been
challenged. and that fact in itself
erodes their ability to direct the
College effectively. 1 would only
add that this perception that
something is wrong here is not
exclusively ' studentrfounded, with
faculty and administrative persons
often voicing similar concerns.

But for all their perspicacity in
assessing the reality as lacking in
direction. the people involved with
SGA have been slow to shake the
mistaken beliefs their predecessors
have held. The first of these is the
belief that an extensive academic
commitment and SGA work are
compatible. They are not. To be
deeply involved with one obviates
the possibility of being effective in
the other. A second mistake is what
Iwill call the belief in an openrhouse
democracy where all students have
a right and desire to participate,
everyone has a right to the ear and
efforts of SGA personnel. and SGA
has an obligation to maintain such a
system. The obvious truth is that
the vast majority of people at this
College do not care about SGA
until they see how SGA can
benefit their position. The third
misconception I would cite ex-
pands on this. This final
mistake is based Von the sense
concerned voices are totally credible
sources of information. To say that
they are not is not to say that what
they say is untrue. But “the truth"
has a certain adaptability to it and
people present it to SGA with an
eye to the advancement of their own
interests, not the edification of
those listening. what they desire is
the enhancement of their political
position through SGA, be they
named KDIC, Mr. Walker, CBS,
or Pet Owners. SGA is seen as a
tool to which they feel legitimate
access, and they use it according.

. ly,

The problem for SGA policyrmar

king is a combination of allthree of
these . the belief in a democratic

framework of likesminded “actors"
is sabotaged by those seeking the
realization of their own aspirations.
And over-extensions in other areas
such as academics do not permit a
careful assessment of what is
coming down.

The SGA reaction, if it gets beyond
others' rhetoric, is an effort to
establish its own authoritative
control over situations and devel-
opments. But SGA‘s role is so

yzes Campus , Politics

often illrdefined, so often interpr-
eted differently, that no one km)-
ws what to believe or expect of it.
Legitimacy from administrators and
faculty members is not easier to
come by than from students. As a '
result, SGA people enter the power
struggles and win some, but almost
invariably lose others where their
supportive information is lacking or
at least inferior. Such entrances
into onertOrone combat plays into
the hands of those who are
prepared to advance or at least
maintain their positions against
SGA wishes. Thus, SGA has spent
more time tryingto identify its role
through struggles with other actors
than it has spent bringing forth its
own policies, What might be more
successful would be disregarding
such involvement: entirely and
concentrating more on implement-
ing its own alterntives whenever,
and however possible. It would
entail self-restraint from power
struggles which are all too attrac-
tive to those frustrated and seek-

. ing redress. But greater effective-

ness for SGA and the
might be the payoff.

The past. SGA Cabinet. it seems to
me, saw too late all of the above, We
spent our time trying to initiate
major changes through major con-
frontationsWe ultimately ran the
same maze of power-
_legitimacy»inertia that plagues so
many areas of the College and
prevents its advance towards cos
herency. In another respect. our
failing stemmed from our unwilling-
ness to play the game full out,
seeing its futility perhaps. In the
end We were too disillusioned to use
what we came to recognize as more
effective means.

For the future, the recommenda-
tions are obvious. The procedures
should be away from listening
uncritically to everyone who steps
forward and more towards the
careful assessment of not only what
people are saying, but why as well.
What is more, SGA leaders should
gather a tight, concerned and able
coterie of associates who may be

College

- counted on to deliver and who are

not too oppressed by other com-
mitments. Further. the effort shou»
id be to work around power
struggles for the sake of imple-
menting alternatives. As mentioned
earlier, the enticement of direct
political hasslng has to be resisted,
The effort should also be made to
utilize the other bases of power
here, both below and above the
specific level of the College political -
actor being confronted. The s c B.
interested faculty and administra-
tors and the Trustees represent
some of these other bases.
