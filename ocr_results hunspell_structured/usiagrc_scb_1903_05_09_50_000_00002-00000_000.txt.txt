hand tor about two years. the
Board at Control should decide on
provrsions tor wearing the Honor
G. or turn the matter over to the
Athletic Union. A misundersiandr

support. He sins against the state,
says the Koran, who appoints to
a public ofﬁce any man when there
exists another who is better quali-

so weighty a matter as the selec.
tion of teams.
