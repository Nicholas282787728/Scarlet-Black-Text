RKEY Day and all of its

bearing down upon us. But as your
thoughts turn to home and the holi~
days, don’t forget to check your zo-
diac. You never know when the stars
may bail you out of a light situation. .

Aries: Preparcyourscll‘ fora long

snows when Grinncllians leave for
the holidays. “nus year is no excep-
tion, eswcially whereyou'rc going.

Taurus: Somewhere,sometime,
when you least expect it, a long,
greasy hair will {all into your food.
Consider yourself forewarned and
inspect accordingly.

Gemini: Revert to yourprerkinA
dergarten mentality. Surely some-
where you can find an episode of
”Zoom.” lfnot. there‘s always the toy
section at Wal-Man.

Capricorn: oivc in to wicked

RINNELLI oun (varia-
tion of ‘Grinnell’, from
‘Grinnell Collcgc’, a small

liberal arts college in central Iowa.)

The term Grinnellittn is tossed
around every day in our conversa-
tions, letters home, and even Scarlet
aridHIack articles. But what doesit
mean? Some students suggest that
being a Grinnellian means “never
having to say you’re sorry," ”an in-
teresting trip,” or even “anxiously
awaiting granola at every medl."

Other, more serious, answers to
this pressing question suggest that a
Grinnellian is someone who takes
pride in Grinnell and works hard for
his or her education. At thcvsamc
Lime,Grinnelliansseemtobccaught
up in “cutthroat academics, stress»
ing even when they're having fun.”

There must be a middle ground
between the “partier” and the “cut-
throat academic" poles. Maybe
Grinnellians are smart men and
women who know when to let loose.
Maybe they are people who take
time off from the weekend to get
some rest by doing a bit of reading
for one or two of their classes.

Of course, there isn‘t a pat anv
swer to this question 7 ll is most
important that Grinnellians are
spread widely across the spectrum
between partier and nerd. Some
Grinnellians even defy categorizal
tion in this context: one Junior sim-
ply sttid, “ I don’t know what it
means. l’m happy to be here.
though.“

Grinncll is unique in many
ways, so Grinnell and Grinlicllians

tend to be dctincd by the college’s
unique characteristics. Grinnell
seeks out students from Ll wide geo
graphic range. so one student says
lhal being a Grinnellian means “I
have ’d lot of places to stay all over
the country!"

GHS Students Have Mixed
Feelings About the College

By Matt Harbur

RINNELL High School
students have mixed
feelings about parts of

the Grinncll. college student
body, but have positive impres—
sions of it as a whole.

Those who had contact with
college students agreed, for the
most part, that they are friendly
and pleasant to be around. High
school students said that they
enjoyed interacting with college
students at college parties, the
PEC. and Forum.

Those students intervtcwed.

cism for some college students’
behavior. Thcir greatest com-
plaint was about students‘ disrer

cross the street and don‘t even
look.” complained one student.

Many high school students
were also intimidated by gay ac-
tivism on campus. “Gay pride
wcek scares me,” said one stu
dent. “This is small-town
America — we are not very re-
ceptive to gays.“ Several stu
dents admitted to being turned
off by gay marches and protests.
and felt that these activities tried
to force homosexual beliefs on
them.

Some high school students
noted that college students con-
tribute to the tension between the
two groups. “Sometimes, they
give you looks,” said one. An,
other student. who works down-
town. complained that college
students were noticeably less
polite than townsIolk. “There’s

an attitude. I can tell the colle_
kids because they treat me ii .
crap,” he claimed. “College sti

that their teachers spoke well

their students to seek help fror
