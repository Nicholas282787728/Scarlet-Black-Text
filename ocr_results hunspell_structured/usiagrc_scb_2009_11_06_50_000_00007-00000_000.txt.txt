WHO’s not afraid of big,‘bad werewolves

Katherine Chungtjoins DAG in werewolf-battling quest for the silver dagger

BY KATHERINE CHUNG

Among last weekend's Halloween ruckus, you may have heard
the occasional howl resonating throughout the Grinnell campus
and wondered if there were werewolves running around. These
howls actually belong to the human members ofWHfPGrin—
ndl's unofﬁcial Werewolf Hunters Organization, led by Molly
Kennedy '11 and Eric Tjossem ’12,

The howls are the battle cries of the members of Grinnelsl’s
WHO, which holds WerewolfTreasure Hunts from September
to‘ November Kennedy described the WHO as a “somewhate
elaborate in joke with DAG,"%n abbreviation for the Daghorir
'clubithat hosts the WerewolfTreasure Hunts as an alternative
form of battle.

“A WerewolfTreasure Hunt battle is a fun and violent version
ofa scavenger hunt crossed with capture the ﬂag," Kennedy said.

The Werewolf Treasure Hunt puts an interesting twist on
werewolf folklore, which originates erorn widespread wolf attacks
on humans in Europe. During the battle, participants are divided
into teams ofwerewolves and humansThe ultimate goal for the
humans is to obtain the “Silver Dagger”ﬁ small DAG sword—
by following a series ofclues, while lighting otrthe werewolves and
“killing" them with their foam swords. The goal for the werewolves
is to “bite" the humans, thus turning them into werewolves.

The battle requires a surprising amount of stamina, along with
physical and mental exertion. Depending on the circumstances the
battle can last for hours on end, which are spent running all over
campus, battling with oversized weapons and shields, deciphering
clues and scrategizing the next move. The physical activity keeps
a constant ﬂow of adrenaline pumping to keep ﬁghters warm in
the chilly fall winds, and the weird states from on-lookers provide
bursts ofhilarity that make the time ﬂy by

"[The Werewolf'l‘reasure Hunt is] my personal favorite [’DAG
build,” Tossem said.‘ Players respond well to the tension and
paranoia created by werewolf, and it's deﬁnitely a completely dif-
ferent experience from a treasure hunt in which no pressure exists."

According to Tjossem, Jacob Cram ‘OG—also known by his
DAG alias Vulturtgfounded the Werewolf Treasure Hunt back
in 2003. Since its creation, the event has been something of a cradle
tion for Grinnell's DAG club, although some may be disappointed
to ﬁnd out that the supposed werewolf club of Grinnell does not
pamke in any omer wnewolf-related activities beyond the were
wolfTreasure Hunt. Rather, Kennedy came up with the idea for
the somewhat ﬁcdl‘lous WHO, in order to promote the continua»
lion of the Werewolf Treasure Hunt battle as well as to attract new
members for DAG, .

“The Werewolf Hunter’s Organization is not actually a club
on campus. It's kind ofa marketing tool that Erichossem and I
created to get people to show up to a WerewolfTreasure Hunt bate
tie. It’s aimed towards people who’ve never participated in DAG
before who are curious enough to wonder who on earth could be
hunting werewolves on this campus,” Kennedy said.

So far their ploy has been working in bringing some would-be
werewolves out into the moonlight. “Werewolf tends to attract a
wider crowd, even townies and students who don't regularly come
to DAG,"Tiossern said.

Regardless of the WHO’s lack of ofﬁcial club status, the
werewoltrreasure Hunt will always be an epic battle, as well as
an opportunity to experience the DAG’s vibrant battle culture. so
for all you closer DAG aﬁcionados out there, contact organizers
[tjosseme] or [kennedym] for future WHO battles. They don't
bite, but they might just whack you with a foam sword

Most students tend to go to the dining
hall in the Joe Rosenﬁeld Center for the
convenience of eating food that has been
prepared for them. However, some students
like Cary Speck'lZ prefer to break down the
barrier between kitchen and dining hall——
creating their own dishcs that stand out next
to a hamburger or pasta with marinara sauce.

“Tonight is probably a ielatively normal
dinner for me,” speck said Tuesday night,
while loading a medley otvegerablcs onto
his tray. "You know, it always depends on

Regardless, mixing black beans, corn,
peppers with lime and Tabasco is not neces
sarily your standard cafeteria dish. “The lime
combines nicely with the beans," Speck said.
“And 1 just like Tabasco on my food in gene

ter, lime juice, pineapples .and bell pepper
together, Sill’fllcd it with Tofu or meat and
then just added random noodles from the
Pasta Bar.”

Other creations of Speck's include oats
meal with coffee, a wafﬂeecake made of
dirferent layers ofwafflcs and toppings and
“W.ifﬂinis," which in essentially Panini
sandwiches toasted using the waffle iron.

“Back when they didn’t guard the waf—

mteresting stuff to the batter,",speclc said
“Basically we used the waffle iron as a Panini
press and made our own sandwiches,"

speck demonstrates that with a little
innovation, the dining hall doesn’t have to
be used exclusively for dining, but can be
employed for cooking as well. “I cook a lot
when 1 am at home, so I’m used to fresh pro»
duce," speck said. “I don't go to the dining
hall to have other people make my food. I
come up with my own ideas”
