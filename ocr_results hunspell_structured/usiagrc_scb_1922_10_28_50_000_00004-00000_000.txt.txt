Exceptionally Large Crowd Out
for First of Series of
Faculty Recitals.

The taeulty recital last evening was
undoubtedly a treat to the cxceptiolb
ally large audicncc which ruled the.
chapel. Miss MacDonald gave a beau-
tiflll interpretation to her numbers.
and her playing was run or contrast
and tonal beauty. The Keltic Sonata
by lilacDowell was undoubtedly the
ﬁnest thing she did.

Mr. Provenscn's singing was char—
actcrized by hcauty of tone and reserve.
”The Two Grenadier-s" was one of the
most pleasing numbers while Phase
pliorenec showed delicacy and' a well
controlled tone.

The next program by the School or
Music faculty will be a program of the
Compositions of Arthur Foote, given
by members of the music faculty and
the two Glee Clubs.
