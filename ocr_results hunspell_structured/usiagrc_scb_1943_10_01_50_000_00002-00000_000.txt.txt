We Did It Before - -

'(t’s; plain to see, glancing- at the file of
t yea "s Scarl t and Blacks, that students
lought to attain another White House.
Yes, we foughta ought through campus
publications, by individual pleas to admin-
lrative heads. We weren’t bucking oppo-
ou, but there were transportation, rcA
, pair, and financial difficulties to be over-
‘ come. We had to keep plugging, show an
undeniable enthusiasm and need, because
someone i_ ’ ht have bogged down. We
(lid. And vie were rewarded with the Stil-
dent Center.

Now there is talk of closing- the Student
Center.

It's more than talkA-more than just
another Grilliiell rumor, It's a distinct
possibility. What’s worse, there appears
to be just cause for this possibility. Again,
it‘s up to the students to remedy the
situation.

During the l'irst tlllce weeks of business
. this year, the Student Center collected $103.
That amount was realized ill three days

. year. Good help is practically iinpos~
Sihlc to get, and one girl is leaving this

week. There have been hours at a time .

when not a Single student has appeared.
With the increase in the piice of food,
not to mention the cost of fuel this winter,
the Student Center, with its present rate
of income, S certain to have a deficit of
not less t on $1,000 at the end of the year.

The White House, as it will always be
thought of in, the minds of mellowed Gl'lllr
ilellians, was opened for an hour and a half
on Sunday morning upon the request of
students. it was a logical request because

breal 'st facilities down town were inade‘

obvious to discuss iil detail.
