The Dramatic club play. "The
Trut by Clyde Fitch. which will he

what stage people call a comeback
play. It was hrst presented in Phila~
delphia in 1909, but tor nearly ﬁve
years had not been seen in this coun-
try. until 1914. when it was revived
with great success, with Miss Marie
George playing the part oi Becky War-
der.

“The Truth" was received from the
ﬁrst with some popularity. but it was
not until after it had made phenome-
nnl runs in London. Berlin and other
continental cities that it was returned
to the United states to receive its
greatest applause,

“The Truth" was considered by the
author himself as the host of his
works. In a letter to Prof. J. P. Ryan.
some years ago. Mr. Fitch tells of the
success his play was having. Mr. Ryan
has received several other letters trom
the noted dramatist telling or the pro-
gress this play was making at that
