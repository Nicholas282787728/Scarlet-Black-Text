The Grinnell coffee company opened
its doors on Monday, March 24, doubling
rhe number of independentlyowned cote
fee shops in downtown Grinnell. As well as
offering various types offreshly roasted eof.
fee, rhe shop offers roe ereani, pastries and

srarring April 15, sandwirhes, soups andsal-
ads.

Owner Garrett Rodie has owned the
property on Main Street sinoe lasryear, but
said he hoped to someday open his own
business long before ihar. A oerrified ac—
eounranr, the former manager of a
Srarbueirs eoffee shop, and rhe partner of
Dan Reynolds, German, Roehe said he has
always wanred ro be his own boss, and to
be able to eonrrol rhe quality ofrhe prod.
uers his srore otters.

The Coffee company, he noted

proudly, is Grinnells only sourse uffreshly»

is parrieularly arrraerive hccause it deals dr.
reerly with Peruvian farmers rather than
intermediary disrriburors and is rhus able
to olifer iis farmers a living wage.

Roehe said he was conﬁdent that Grlnr
nell can support two coffee shops,

“It has been proven that when addi-
rienal eoffee goes into rhe marker, rhe pie
gen bigger," hesard, "so sch individual sliee
gers bigger."

0660 houses to be
sold, transported

Off-campus houses will be sold to community
buyers on the condition that they be moved to
make way for parking and landscaping

Staff Writer

Got a buck?

The house: on ion 913 6th Avenue. 916/918 6th Avenue, 1018 Park
St, and 916 8th Avenuc are being put on the market as- is for $1 each.

The four houses will only he sold to qualified buyers. Ariy qualified
buyer must assume the Cost of moving the house and must invc rnoving
insuranee end a proofofineenr to nieve rhe house between May 20 and
May so. The buyer must commit to rliese rerms and provide full docu»
menrarion by April 25.

The terms are similar to the Salt ofscvcrdl residences on East Street
and Park streer rwo years ago. The smaller houses on 1416 and 1422 East
Street were movsd, Th: lots were across (ht: street from the new residenc:
halls on ism campus and have remained empty sinee the houses were
sold in june 2001.

The college eonsidered rhar initial sale a siieeess good enough to It
peat. The Offise of Community Enhaneemenr also thought that there
was enough loul inreresr for an equally sueeessful seeond arrempr,

“since i started in August, I have had a steady rrielele of callers who
wanted to be notified if the college madt: the same offu,” said Amy
Kaikbrenncr, the oﬂicc'x interim director.

After a buyer agrees re the terms the eollege will shur ofrall rhe uriliries
and rhe buyer will move each house, complete with fiirnaee and hor water
heater. Ifthc houses air: not sold, they will be destroyed to cicur the lot.

The emptied lors on 6th and 8th Avenue will be eonverrsd ro pausing
or iandscap: ar:as, However, Kalkbmnnct emphasired that th: eollege
"won’t beshoehorning all the parlcingspaees rherwill fit on the tor." Rather,
rhere will only be a few added parking spsees and rhe majoriry of9 16/918
6th Avenue and the 8th Avenue lot will he greenr soaped,

No on: has plans yet for d-ic lot on Park Street, Kalkhrenner said the
reason for rhe sale was d1:t"it's nor a house that needs more repairs than
is worthwhile to put into it."

Kallcbrenner saw die sale as a way ro improve town-gown relarions
while elearing the way for the eollege’s development. “These houses have
outlived rheir usefulness to the eollege,” she said, “bur perhaps rhey ran be
353“: for someone else I think making the effort to market it is worth
