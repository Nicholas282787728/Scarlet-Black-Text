Englishmen to Appear
On Platform Tonight

ARGUMENT WILL BE SCIENCE
VERSUS HUMANITIES
AND ART.

The widely. heralded international
debate between Cambridge Universi—
ty, England, and Grinnell college will
be held in Herrick Chapel tonight at
3 o’clock. The debate has caused
unusual interest upon the campus
and should be the best of the season.

The Crinnell debaters have been
working zealously under coach w.
Earl deem to successlully test their
iorenslc mettle in tonight's internat-
ional contest.

Audience Will You

The audience will be asked to vote
not upon the merits of the de—
baters but merely as an expression or
its opinion on the question. After
the debate the chairman will call up-
on the house to make a standing vote
which will declare itself favorable.
opposed or neutral to the proposition.

The question, “Resolved. That the
future or the human race depends
more upon the sciences than upon the
arts and humanities." Inimitable in its
aspects, it is one which the English»
men have argued upon in a majority
at their former debates.

The Cambridge team is made up of
men who have all had considerable
political and debating experience.
Michael Ramsey, captain of the team,
has been associated with Cambridge
as his home and birthplace as well as
his uuivcrs , He is particularly in-
terested in the classics. a subject
which iits well with the subject being
debated, though his speeches in the
university have been on questions at
modern democracy, imperialism, and
liberalism. He has been active in lo~
c'al politics and has already declined,
'lor the present, an invitation m stand
for the House of, Communs,

Geoffrey Lloyd, attending Trinity
College, has served as president or the
Cambridge Union, and also has been
active in politics, having contested
SouLheEast southwst-k in the Conser~
vative interest in the -last general
election. In 1924 he was attached to
Mr. Baldwin's secretariat.

\Patrick Devlin, a law student at
Christ's College, has distinguished
himseli as a speaker both at the line
ion and elsewhere, A smunch Con-
servative, he has upheld the Tory tra-
dition and his principal speeches have
been on national and imperial poli-
tics.

Grinnell Mell Exliel‘leneetl

Though the Grinnell men have not
had the practical experience or the
English debaters, they have all done a
great deal or speaking. James Work,
president of the Grinnell Forensic;
has had varsity experience, and was
one of the team which debated Oxiord
last year, Robert Burlingame and
Russell Smith have both spoken in
high school and in addition made the
varsity last year in debates against
Ames, Creighton, and Knox.

During the stay or the Cambridge
visitors in Grinnell, the lantern and
the Debating Union will both give
them a luncheon, if time and circum-
stances permit.

Twenty»eight debates and the same
number of schools are on the sched»
ule oi the visiting Englishman in
their tour oi the schools of the Mid-
dle-West, which is lasting irom Oc~
tober a to November 23. Colleges mct
extend irom the state Normal College
at Bowling Green, Ohio, as far as
Drake University in Des Moines, and
include such institutions as the Uni-
versities of Iowa, Ohio, Indiana, Illi—
nois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Last
night the team met Northwestern
university at Evanston on the same
question that is being debated tonight.
The team will sail November 25.

Oxiord University also has a team
making a tour oi the Eastern colleges
of the United states, meeting Cornell
in the north and going as far south
as the University or North Carolina.

Debuting iInny Questions
subject being debated by the Eng-
lish teams are all of an interesting
nature. Cambridge has on its sched
ule such questions as: Resolved, That

One Game to Flu)".

Another week or intramural speed-
ball saw the completion or three
three games, the result being that
Dibble hall alone remains with a. per»
feet percentage. With only one game
remaining on its schedule it is highly
probable that Lnnlbly’s crew will turn
in another championship. Building
Three still retains a chance to tie Six
in case the letter drops their last
game to Smith ball and the former
wins its remaining games.

Clark hall aspirations were given a
permanent setback when they lost to
Dibble, in a hard fought game Tuesc
day. The offense of Six was to much
tor the lighter men of Clark, and at
the half the half the score was 5 to 0
against the Fillers, A second period
rally fell short after Edwards had
scored a iicld goal tor a starter and
the Dibbleites went to the showers.
with a 5 to 3 victory,

On Wednesday Buildings Two and
Four furnished a game that contrast-
ed the mud battle or the preceeding
day. The teams played clean and
good ball, and the score does not
show the closeness oi! the contest.
Goals by Guild and Mondt and a pass
to Mondt accounted ior Langim’s
points, while a pass to Schlll consti—
tuted the total scoring done by Four.
The final score was s. to 2.

Thursday's game was the most
spectacular or the series, with the
two undefeated eievens of Dibble and
Three meeting, Three opened the
scoring shortly aiier the game had
begun, when Taylor passed to Pet-
erson who dropped the ball and rush-
ed a goal. Dibble retaliated with a
goal by Moore, and Nicolet added to
Six’s score by a pretty drop kick.
Peterson again scored for Three by
making a penalty kick good. The
half ended 7 to 4 in favor or Six. In
the next stanza Three opened up a
rushing oitcnse and ran the score to
7—3 by scoring a pass to Peterson.

From this point on good defensive
play by both sides kept the scoring
down, and the game ended with Three
vainly trying to even the count.

Appeal Made For
Bird Protection

Whiter Bennett Stresses Need For
Conserﬂlﬁml of Niltlu'e.

“How some people can live with na-
tllre all about them and never see it
is more than I can understand," Te-
lu’drked Walter W. Bennett, noted
authority on bird lite in his lecture
last night. at the Congregational
Church. "We must become inlai-
ested in nature Conservation of
our natural resources may mean the
future of the United States.”

He showed that Chinahas arrived at
a point where industry of all kinds is
being blunted merely because they
did not conserve their forests and
wild game. Europe is fast approach-
ing the same destiny, Germany being
the only nation far—sighted enough to
sponsor forest conservation.

Then turning m America, formerly
the land of plenty, he mentioned the
fact that we too are gradually losing
the bufialo, wild "turkey, prairie
chickens, and (Crests so abundant in
the time of Marquette and Joliet.

"For this reason, we must go to
the islands to study bird life," he
continued. “Here remain the last
traces of American Wild bird life.
rlying ahead oi man and gun they
have settled by the thousands on the
islands of the lakes in northern Min—
nesota and North Dakota. These 15»
lands are chosen because they furn-
ish a, resting place, supply (00d, and
are secure from the approach or men
and animals."

His lecture was illustrated by about
a hundred slides in natural colors
having been photographed by the
speaker himself. They included
views of the Devil’s Lake region of
North Dakota and oi the bird liie
studied there.

He described the Franklyn Gull
telling how these birds saved the
Mormons at a critical time by destroy.
ing a swarm ol grasshoppers that
was ruining the crops.

He save many other interesting ob-
servations of the habits of various
birds including the white pelican.
herring gull, prairie chicken, sharp-
taued grouse. connorants, and even
the avoctet, one of the birds of which
exceedingly little is known.

The methods at studying Wildbil‘ds
were also discussed. All work of this
kind must he done under cnmuuflztge
and With utmost precaution. Even
then, the best results are nearly al—
wﬂys due (C luck.

He reviewed the progress of (miners
vation in the United states, making a
plea for increased work along this
line in the future. He suggested that
Iowa adopt a plan such as is used in
North Dakota \vllel'e private sections

no (lugs should be allowed to run

FIFTEEN PIONEER FOOTBALL MEN
MAKE FINAL BOW 0N WARD FIELD

Today’s game marks the iiual air
pearnnce on Word Field or iiiteen
pioneers. The bucklield will be hard-
est hit us three of the first string
backs will be lost by the diploma,
route.

Captain Meredith Sweet is playing
his third year for the Scarlet and
Black and his loss will be keenly
ielt. His work has been consistent
and has stamped him as one or the
best halfbacks in the Missouri Valley.
In 1924 he was a unanimous choice
tor the mythical Allynlley eleven.
His fighting spirit has meant much to
the success uf Grinnell teams.

Harry Wing has played at lullback
ior three years and has won many
admirers. This last season his play-
ing has been phenomenal and the
deicnsivc strength oi the teain has
been built about him. Wing’s work
should Wztl'l'zmt him recognition by
Valley sport writers.

Francis Moran, ior two years one
of the most consistent ball toters in
the conference, will be lost to the
Pioneer squad. Littlc need be said

Fighting with their backs to the
wall, the Kansas Jayhawkers are
primed to the limit for this after-
noon-s encounter. with the pioneers.
The squad arrived in the city shortly
after noon yesterday, taking a. short
workout on Word iicld later in the a:-
ternoou. Because Coach “Potsy”
Clark’s men have succeeded in win-
ning but one game this season, Plo—
neer followers fear that the Kansas
aggregation will make a. desperate
fight to annex a win today at Grin-
nell‘s expense.

Jnyhnnrks Hove roar Dooord

Jaybawker contests against Iowa
schools have proved disastrous this
year tor the Crimson and Blue has
held the short end at 7—0 and 20-0
scores against Drake and Amos, res~
nec‘tivcly. Today's conilict marks the
iirst time that Kansas and Crinnell
have met on the gridiron. Another
interesting fact about the contest is
that Crinncll-s assistant coach is
Charles Black, said to be K. U’s great~
est living aﬂdlete, and captain of the
1923 undefeated football team whose
goal line was never crossed.

Practically the same lineup that
laced Oklahoma last Saturday will
take the field against Crlnnell today.
The injury, list has been decreased
until Capt. Smith and Starr are the
only members of the squad nursing
serious injuries.

Smith Injured

Among the ranks at the invaders is
Reginald "Babe" Smith, contain and
ail—valley tackle, At present he is
on the injured list but be may get in-
to the fray this aiternoon. Davidson
center, is making a strong ﬁght ior an
all-valley ranking at the pivot posi-
tion, while H, Baker, end, andean,
fullback, are other consistent per-
ionncrs who have made good show—
ings in {last games.

While the records are not very im—
pressive irom a Kansas viewpoint,
there has been a tendency to under-
estimate the southern aggregahou.
Several times the "breaks" have
raised niwoc with their hopes and-
turtbermore, their improvement in
play was very noticeable last Sature
day when Oklahoma was decisively
outplayed the last hall.

Pioneers in Good shape

The Pioneers came out of tho Amos
encounter in good shape with the ex—
ception of Seelaud who is in fair
condition for the battle this afternoon,
Davis and Meeter suttered minor in-
juries but are now ready for a great
battle.

The play or Meeter, Martin, Davis
and Wing will be closely watnhed by
valley critics today. All oi these men
have been playing stellar football all
season and their showings in the two
remaining games will determine
largely their chances at gaining all—
vallcy recognition. Mayer and Capt.
Sweet are other strong possibilities
who may show up better in these
games.

Providing- over-confidencs or
"breaks" do not work to Grinnell’s
llisadlmntage, the Pioneers should take
the count of the inyhowkers. The
Crimson and Blue forward wall is
reputedly rather wcak and the rioneer
elf-tackle smashes should work in
good shape. in puuting, Crlnncll
should also excel the Jayhawkers for
