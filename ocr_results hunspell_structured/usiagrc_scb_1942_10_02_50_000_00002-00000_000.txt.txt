WHAT'S GOING ON?

With the degree of decentralization on the
campus this year, it is of paramount impor—
tance that students be informed of the ac-
tivities—curricular and extra-curricular—
that are taking place.

A possible and practical solution to the
difficulties in transmitting news to the stu-
dents is an organization now under co sid-
eration by administrative officials. alled
the Grinnell Student News Service, it would
maintain bulletin boards in strategic parts
of the campus, in all cottages and halls, and
in class buildings. It would supervise the

issuing- of announcements to house and cot—
tage chairmen to be read at housemeetings
It would bring the college activities to the
students in accessible and reliable form.

This plan has been submitted by students
to President Ste ens. It can be called noth-
ing but a glo ied bulletin board system.
But bulletin boards have, in the past, been
much»malig1ied objects on this campus. They
may yet prove the solution to the problem
of “What’s going on around here?”

Especially now, with students eating in
shifts in the dining hall, announcements
are missed or are not heard clearly. Espec<
ially now, with changes in meeting places
occuring daily, the Scarlet and Black can-
not print day-to-day schedules of every or<
ganization; they are changed too suddenly
to be accurate. Therefore it seems that a
service as desci bed above is necessary.

The extra-curricular activities and organ-
izations are an important part of this col—
lege. No student Should be misinformed
about them, and the part he may take in
their program.

THE LAST LINK

Humor-minded students may now cast their
fears to the winds. The publication board’s
announcement that there Will be a Zephyr
appearing on campus welds the last link in
the Grinnell chain of publications

There have been doubts among the stu-
dent body that not enough people would be
interested in furthering wit on the campus
in such times as these.

But thanks to a few who hold that humor
has never been needed as it is nowothe
Zephyr will be out. And that, Mr. Schlkel-
gruber, should answer your questions about
our morale.

All's Well—

Colcls Prevalen‘l
—My Honky

Sniff! Everybody’s doing it these
days. The unseasonable spell of
cold weather and rain and snow
has brought with it an epidemic
or colds, major and minor.

Kleenex is as common in classes
as notebook paper. Students take
time out to sneeze. The infirmary
is iunclioning happily. Cold pills
and vitamin pills, nose drops and
gargle solutions are scattered
throughout every cottage and hail,
until the observer wonders if
these buildings are dormitories or
hospitals.

The healthy individual is easily
spotted by his cries of “Keep
away from me!” when anyone
near him shows a tendency to
cough or sneeze. And the person
who walks alone is not anti-social;
he just doesn’t want to catch cold.

Bass the gleenex, blease.
