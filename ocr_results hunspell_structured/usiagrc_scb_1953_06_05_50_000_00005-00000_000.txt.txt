The project of doing away

with the groundwork laid for

The underlying issue that

League Board. embers of the
195253 League Board Juan Bel»
sterli, Jan Chaplin, Nancy Scrur
by, Norma Tong, D. J. Harbcck,
Eli wilcox, and Lora Lee Pugh,
were led by Ellie Park as they
headed the women’s government
board.

One of the very tirst proiects
of this year’s Board came in the
fall when they acted as hostesses

to the members of the Boa‘i'd OfY

Trustees when they conic to the
campus tor a meeting.

Alter the day's meetings the
board and the c or HP met
with tlic trustees to discuss
some oi the college rules and
general rules polices. Many

misconceptions on‘ the part oft

the governing boards and the.
were cleared up by
this discussion .

Another ~st" was initiated
by the board this fall when they
ended lrcshman prepping with
a spccial service in Main lounge.
After the props burned thcir
grcen prepping ribbons at the
service, they were ofiicially wel—
comed into the Women's Govern-
ment association and given brief
background on women’s govcrn-
ment and its tunctions.

Thc rest of the ch’anges made
by the board this year were
gradual ones resulting from
much time and effort, Some of

foriiittls‘

so rhangcs are still the

t
1process iormation.
! Aitcr the hoard got its govc
ing iunctions down to a walt~
ble routine, it split into various
committccs to begin some cf its
projects tor the year.

One of these committccs has
worked on rules and regula»
tions and laid the groundwork
for rule changes. It did exten-
sivc work with questionairc's
sent to other schools‘ similar
\to arinucll and made use of
surveys taken of south campus
I opinion on li-eshmnn rules and
the allrcampus car and drink.
ing rulcs.

Changes in the freshman rc—
gulation on lights out and nights
out resulted from this work.
These rules now will be en
forced only during the first X
weeks or the school year, in-
stcad oi a whole semester.

Anothcr committee has Sp‘”lt
;many hours goiyg over the prev
Isent constitution with a lillr:
ilooth comb, to reword ambigi-
ous statements and rules. An—
other revision, now in its limit
stages, is the "Dope Paddler,"
the women’s rule book; The
rules have been clarified, cla
ified alphabetically, and all
gathered into one booklet. Some
oi the men’s rules that are pt.»-
tincnt to women have also been
included in this book. -

Another change that we
happen during the school year
was tho end of the quadrangle
checkvin system.

Perhaps from the standpoint
of student government the most
valuable piece of work done by
the League Board was its orient-
ation program tor the new Board
members. The 1953-54 League
Board will have a definite ad-
vantage when they begin their
work next fall‘because of this
lprogram.
