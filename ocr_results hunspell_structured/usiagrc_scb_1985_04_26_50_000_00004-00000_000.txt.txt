“Viva Nicaragua Librel." Dr, Linda
Farley proclaimed that while traveling
in Nicaragua with the National Health
Campaign to survey health care condi-
tions. she acted “as much as a political
activist as anything else,” Farley, and
her husband. Dr, Eugene Farley, of the
University of Wisconsin spoke this
week in Scum Lounge on “Revolution
and Health Care in Nicaragua,”

Both doctors were present as part oi
the week long conterence to explore
US, and Central American relations.

port Group.

Ms. Farley commented that this
week was especially appropriate ior the
series on U.S.»Central American rela-
tions because oi Reagan's $14 million
bill for “humanitarian aid.” (The bill
was rejected by the House Tuesday).
While stunning advances have been
made in Nicaragua In recent years and
while Nicaraguan technology exceeds
that of most Central American coun»
tries. the Farleys stressed the iact that
“if we vote for what Reagan wants,
we’ll ruin what progress they‘ve

mosphere. She also said that
Nicaraguans like Americans, and want
Americans to see that the people are
not in dire straits as the current Reagan
administration presents them.

Nicaraguan doctors attend six years
of medical school immediately after
high school, then spend two years in
rural community service. Clinics, Stali-

population. but birth control is

According to die Farteys. the wealthy
maintain more ready access to health
care because of the political situation in
Nicaragua. Mr. Farley's statistics
showed that the wealthy live about 20
years longer than their poorer counter-
parts. ln the less afﬂuent areas,

“Who are the

real terrorists”

by Mark \Vl‘SclIumaIIn

John Kelly, oi National Reporter, ap-
peared Wednesday night in South
Lounge to make his case to a crowd oi
mostly supportive students. iaculty.
and townspeople

Kelly repeatedly asked, “Who are the
terrorists?" in his attacks on the
American intelligence community,
noting his iormer agency's recent
adventures in Nicaragua “Most people
would not want to have anyting to do
with the CIA if they really knew what it
was,” he said, The Agency, he
elaborated. routinely conducts
assassinations of minor Sandinista 0F
iicials as part or its campaign to topple
the Nicaraguan government, that praCs
tice. contended Kelly, is illegal even in
wartime. He criticized its other recent
activities in Nicaragua as Well as past
involvements in Cuba, Angola, and
Chili.

One point Kelly made over and over
again was that there is no speciiic
statutory authorization tor the CIA to
conduct any activities that were not ac-

tually intelligence-gathering in nature.
And, when the agency must go to Con-
gress for money to iund speciiic opera-
tions, only a very few congressmen are
told exactly how much money was be
ing requested and tor what precise pur
pose; the others have to rely on the
Judgment oi the appropriations com-
mittees. he said.

in a recent story. the National
Reporter. accused Arturo Cruz, a
lavorite oi Reaganites because of his
lormer Sandinista ties and current anti-
Sandinista statements, of being an
employee 01‘ the CIA, Kelly reinted the
argument that the contras are
“freedom iighters" by citing a con-
gregational report that tortyrsix oi the
iorty-eight top-level Contra oiticers are
in fact former Somocistas. While no
