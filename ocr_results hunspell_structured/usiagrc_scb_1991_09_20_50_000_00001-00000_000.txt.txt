GRINNELL COLLEGE . GRINNELL, IOWA

By Daniel Bliss

Cleveland Hall residents claim a
fire alarm failed to work adequately
duringMonday‘sflrclltcrc.Thealann,
whichnulomaticallyalerted Physical
Plant staff via their control system,
was said by many residents who were
there at the time of the fire to have
soundod in the residence hall for just
a few seconds. Evacuated students
subsequently heard smoke detectors
in other rooms going off, as the fire
poured smoke over a wide area.

The fire began as students were
leaving for 11am classes. A call was
received at the Grinnell fire station at
10:53, almost at the same time as the
fire alarm con nol panel fit the Physi-
calPlarltalcrtchuildingand Grounds
staff. The fire alarm system was shut
off at 10:55 along with the power to
the buildingloallow ﬁrefighters,wh0
were on the scene wilhin 3 minutes of
the original call, to extinguish the
ﬂames with water.

Many residents said that the fire
alarm system was on neither long
enough nor loud enough. At least two
students, Andy Coghill and Klay
Burchett, were still asleep in their
rooms when die alarm sounded and
were woken up by ﬂoorrnates who
alerted them before B & G staff and
fire crews got to thescene. According
to Coghill. the ﬁre alarm was off by
the time he was awake. Rod Miles of
Cleveland 3rd, who warned otherstu»
dents of the ﬁre before the alarm
started, said mat it could not have
been on for more than a few seconds.
“It was real shortbeeauscl was onmy
way downstairs [when it sounded]

and it was off by the time I was
downstairs,” he said. Sarah Gott—
schalk, also a Cleveland 3rd resident,
remarked that it lasted “20 seconds
tops."

Butofﬁcial sources maintain that
the system worked properly. Ac-
cording to Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Crady, the alarm system ran for
about 2 minutes before it and the
power to the residence hall were shut
off. Vice President Waldo Walker
said that the alarm may have seemed
short because it was switched off very

quickly due to the rapid response of
the fire crew.

An investigation by the ﬁre mar-
shal into the cause of the ﬁre has been
completed, according to SGA Presi-
dent Matt Stippich, who understands
that the college “should have a ert~
ten response from him soon.” Dean
Crady could not confirm the cause of
the ﬁre, but said there was a tentative
understanding that it was started by
candles.

Witll the completion of the inves-
tigation, workers moved in Wednes~

day to clear the room of irreparable
belongings and furniture so that re-
pairs can be carried out. According to
Crady. the room shouldbereadytobe
reoccupied widiin two weeks.
Concern aboutﬁre safety has been
running high following incidents of
faulty alarms in Haines and Yourlker
halls this year. In addition, several
smoke detectors in rooms have been
tampered with, which is a misde-
meanor under Iowa law. B & G work—
ers have been testing ﬁre systems
across campus in the past two weeks.

New attitude for Grinnell gay community

By Steve Clem
and Kim Eckart

This year, Grinnell’s gay/lesbian/
bisexual community has experienced
many changes, from the renaming of
the Human/Gay Resource Center as
the Stonewall Resource Center, to the
emergence of a new organization.

GQ, or Grinnell Queers, is the
newest addition to Grinnell’s gay/
lesbian/bi groups. Steve Zeliadt, a
memberofGQ,explainedthcgroup's
emergenceas a way to meet the needs
of gays whoare“out,loud,andproudr"

IN THIS ISSUE

According to Zeliadt, “Grinnell’s gay
community is not very unified. The
reason the various groups have come
about is because of the level at which
people wish to come out"

Zelladt points out that in the past
Grinnell wanted an all-encompass-
ing gay community. including allies
as chl as gays, striving for one com-
mon goal. “That just didn‘twork. The
new situation allows us to specialize
on the different needs,” Zeliadt said.

GQmembers believe thatthelarger
number of gay groupson campus will
help bring more non-gay allies into
the gay community. With the GQ
sewing as the voice for the proud and
out community. the Grinnell Com-
munity to End Homophobia (GCEH)
isin existence for those curious about
homosexuality, regardless if they are
gay or straight. According to Zeliadt,
“The people attending GQ are the
people who are not afraid of admit
ting their sexual preferences, whereas
GCEl-I has members who have just
come outof the closet and may notbe
comfortable in wearing the pink trie
angle out and about.“

Although GCEH is considered by
its members to be a more moderate
organization that emphasizes educa-
tion and outreach to the entire cam-
pus community. member Alanna
Walen said that GC‘EH and GQ will
continue to work together on activi-
ties such as study breaks and parties
“This division is a good thing. It will
allowall groups toachicve their goals.
We really ﬂoundered last year," she
said.

The Coming OutGroupis specif-
cally a suppormriented group that
allows gays, lesbians and bisexuals
who have recently come out to share
their experiences. Member Anna
Marsh said that the group has a time-
limited function, because as people
become more comfortable. they may
move on to other groups. “I think it
serves itspurpose," said Marsh. “The
best thing about it is that it‘s gay
space. It gives peopleachance to deal
with being gay around other people."

Another group new to Grinnell
mis year is Queer Colors, which Io»
cusesonhomosexualissuesforpeople
of color. The group’s founder, Elena
chal said, “There is always this
supposed gay agenda, but that doesn't
always work [or all of us. We hope
our group will supply support for
those gay/lesbian/bis who are multie
cultural."

Zeliadt concluded that thccurrent
structure may serve as a process for
Grinnell‘s homosexual community.
“What Grinnell now has, ideally, is a
lot of different steps for the gayﬂes»
bian/bis,withGQbeingtheﬁnalstcp."
