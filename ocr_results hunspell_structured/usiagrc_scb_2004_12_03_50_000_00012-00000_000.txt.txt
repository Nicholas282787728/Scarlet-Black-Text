Let’s get stupid!

Tuesday—Everythiniin-a- Or, how to undo months of cross country training in one week of joyful idiocy

av Juan WALLACE

The crossrcountry team christened
“Stupid Week” years ago to celebrate
the freedom to, well, not run. After
winning their 18th Midwcst Confer-
ence championship in 19 years (see
Monmouth, 1994), ﬁnishing ﬁfth in
the central Region and sending Jus-
rin Riley ‘06 to the NCAA Champi-
onships, the time is
nigh for the selfrimr
posed destruction of
rhese fmclymuned
athletes,

The first event,
the now famous
“Beer Mile," was
contested last Sunday
night. The rules, like
Othello, are easier
explained than enacted, Each compctr
itor consumes six alcoholic beverages
in an hour and then races n mile for a
chance to go down in history among
such immorrnls as John Aerni ‘01,}irn
Hackett ‘02 and Adam Booth ‘04.

This is no ceremonial stroll around
the track either; Booth's Beer Mile res
cord, set last year at 4:42, is nothing to
scoff at.

“I think the key for me was swiping
some of Charlie Knuth [‘08]’s insulin

.,

”I felt elated when I
finished and heard I
broke five [minutes],
then i puked for three
minutes straight.”
iAdam Bea/s '06 case any of the nth

and shooting up before the race," said
Adam Beals .06, always looking for an
edge. “I felt elated when I ﬁnished and
heard I broke ﬁve [minutes], then I
puked for three minutes straight."
Colin Tschida ‘os nearly toppled
Booth’s record on its ﬁrst anniversary,
winning this year’s running in a swift
4:43, Mitch Herz ‘05 and Justin Riley
loo ﬁnished just her
hind Tschida at 4:46
and 4:47 respecrively.
Beals ﬁnished sixth
in an honorable 4:54.
As one would expect,
industrial-sized trash
cans are on hand in

letes succumb to beer
pressure.

The Beer Mile is only the ﬁrst
of many patently idiotic activities
in which the runners engage dining
stupid Week. Traditionally, rhere has
been a "Towel Dinner" involving :l
teum dinner in Cowles sporting only
PEC towels, a “No-Hands Dinner“ in
Cowles usually scheduled to coincide
with Beef Stroganoff, and “Cookie
Day," perhaps the most grueling event
in which, for 24 hours, one eats only

A new addition to this year's mor
tonic festivities will be the A.].'s 80*
ounce-challenge. Hen, Pete Cueno
‘06 and other runners will invade the
steakhouse and try to put down 80
ounces ofsteak in one hour.

Other recent additions to the
schedule are the Everything-in-a-glass
dinner, to be held in conjunction with
Towelrdinner, and the PEC Krumm/
Rock Creek Hill and Dale Ultimate
Team Challenge, n two-team compe-
tition in which one team will drive to
Rock Creek, the other to the Krumm
Namic Preserve. After the drive, the
teams will run to the other location,
use a copy of the key to srarr rhe car
and race back to the PEC. The ﬁrst
group to return will win the challenge.

“The ‘04 Beer Mile highlight was
seeing Colin. nftcr booting Team
Americarstyle for five minutes straight,
look up and solemnly say, somebody
get me out of these wet clothes and
into a dry martini,” said team captain
Dave Honig loo.

Honig also had a favorite event for
the week

“My favorite part of stupid week is
‘homcwotk night,"’ he said. “We do so
much homework!"

:ch WALSH '05 hit two free throws
with seconds remaining to lift
Grinnell MEN’S EASKETBALL to is
ﬁrst victory on Saturday, 130—123
at Warthurg in overtime. But three
days later Grinnell came within a
whisker of pulling off an even more
impressive win. Down 22 points
with two minutes gone in the
second halt, the Pioneers outscored
host Mt. Mercy—who had beaten
them aweek earlier by 19 points—

. 55-33 over a 14-minute span and

pulled to within 103407 with 4:21
to play. The Mustangs pulled away
from there, however, outscoring
Grinnell 20-9 down the stretch. The
loss drops cnnnell, which opened
with 13 straight wins last year, to
17:. overall. So rar, WOMEN’S
BASKETBALL’S three-point numbers
have been a good indicator of their
success. In its season-opening
73-70 win against Eureka in the
ﬁrst round or the Elmhursl. College
Tournament, Grinnell drained 35%
or its trays and 14 overall, ﬁve hy
ANNA vm'os. However, Grinnell
Shot 27.3% and 28.5% in its two
defeats, to rtmhurst College and
Luther. WOMEN'S SWIMMING
AND DIVING topped the University
of Chicago on Nov. 20 by a 183415
tally, but the MEN’S SWIMMING
AND DIVING team rell 133-105 at
the same meet. only 53 schools
