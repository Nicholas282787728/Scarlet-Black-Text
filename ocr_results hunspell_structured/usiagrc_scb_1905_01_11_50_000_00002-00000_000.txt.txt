though coming at a rather early date,
should bea great help L0 the home
team and or particular interest to
the students, as it iviil serve as a
means or gettinga line on the team
torth'eliard season that is starting,
Every student can point ivitb pride

corded t‘illmote's 1' .lloiinrs, there is
little r ii why our past recold can
notbe sustained during the coming
year. '1 lie unusual interest which has
been shown during the class games
bespcalts a liberal student backing tor
the college team and it is hoped that
the students ivill begin right by tieely
patroni iig thegame nest Saturday.
Here's to a successtnl season,

HATEVER may be the general
opinion as to the wisdom shown
by the debating union in talriiig on a
second inter-collegiate debate no one
can interpret the action cEIici-wisc
than asa healthy sign~a sign that
debating intoicsts are not to siilziei-
from apatliytlui-iiig the present win—
m at least, it is especially gratify
ing in view or the lack of interest
which has recently been shown in the
work of our craters, tor the inevitable
i'esuitiof the ‘new policy must be to
keep alive a passion ror rorensies dili‘t
ingalonger pcl'icd than its custom-
my existence, This year Glinneil’s
illitei’est in debating will not liavea
chance to die its wonred death as soon
as we have met Cornell.

Encouragement however to those or
pessimistic persuasion is not the
greatest oi the causes for rejoining.
The more cheerrul observer will in-
stinctively think of the glory that
awaits Grinnell in the event or a
double victory. oiiv everhonorab'eand
all but ever luokless debating history
should be seasoned more nearly to the
taste or tile coming generations,
Here then is an opportunity for ivork
and it it succeeds to the fullest extent
the college debatei-sotioo; may wear
the laurel iorcver. Scanner awn
BLACK is conﬁdent that these two en-

, terprises will tind solid approval among
iaculty, students and alumni.

MISS FISHER’S RECITAL
Miss Fisher gave her second recital
To day evening It was an even
mo c pronounced success than her
ti t. The Gi-icg songs were all beau-
tiiul, and the audience was highly
favored in hearing so many, as
critics assert that it is as a song
writer that Grieg will have his great-
est claim to greatness in future gener-
ations. The song by Eleanor Smith
an American writer. gave evidence of
very real talent. ”All Souls’ Day,” by
Von Flellt' does not compare with
Richard St iissls conception of the
same verse. Miss Fisher gave “1 am
Esmeralda" exquisitely. and displayed
her usual dramatic grasp in the "Scena
and Prayer ii-oin Der Freyscilu l. The
programme:
Gi iey Soivejg’s Song
Summer Eve
Violet
With a Water-lily
Two brown eyes
Good Morning
Sltlill Emails
