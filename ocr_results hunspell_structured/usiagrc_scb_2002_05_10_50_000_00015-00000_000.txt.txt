Dick doesn’t even come into it

Spend your forum balance if you want, but don’t
buy food out of spite or out of some desire to convince
administrators that the Forum sells overpriced food.
We subsidize that food every semester with our unused
Dining Dollars—the only thing that will happen if
we all max out our accounts will be another round of
price hikes next semester. If you really want to drive
down prices, buy a smaller meal plan. They cost more
per meal, but Dining Services relies on our eyes to be
bigger than our stomachs every year—ifwe only pay
for what we're going to Consume, Dick might start to
wonderif his prices are dampening demand. Not that
you shouldn’t buy ice cream foryour friends. And for

Year-end fears and cheers

Cluad lines. People having prolonged conversations
at the salad bar, People who throw their trash outside
the basket and Can't remember how to ﬂush the toilet.
Disgusting things on the shower cubicle ﬂoor. Dorms
that smell like cat pee and lounges that smell like feet.
Computer labs that smell like people who haven’tshow-
ered in days. The guy who comes to class smelling like
the Marlboro Man. The girl at the Forum who annoys me
for no apparent reason. Ignorant hippies.

Smiling, friendly people. Central Campus in the spring
with people playing guitar and reading in the sunlight,
Chance encounters with random strangers who almost
seem like friends. Late-night conversations, drunk and
when People who care about you. Cynics. Idealists.
Beautiful people everywhere.

I’m gonna miss you guys.

Our bad dorm room

Room 3012 (James Pit, next to bathrooi‘n) should
be a single. Two people should not have to be sub-
jected to cohahit in such tiny quarters. The
only positive thing is thatin the event ofa tornado,
you probably won't die because the window is the
size of a postage stamp.

We extend ourdeepest sympathies to Adam Schwartz
’05 and Jason Carpp ’05 for having to follow in our
footsteps. Just remember—the "double" next door
has three closets and you should insist that you get
one of them. And know that one of the bathrooms
has a tub so ifyou don‘t ﬁtin this underground cave,
its yours to sleep in
