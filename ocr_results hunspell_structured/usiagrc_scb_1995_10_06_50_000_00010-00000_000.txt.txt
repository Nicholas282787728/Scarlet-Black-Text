South DiVision at the halfway point
of the season with a record of 5-0.

Last Thursday the booters pum<
meled Cornell in Mount Vernon, 9—
0. Coach Jenny Wood praised the
efforts of her team, especially on
defense, saying, “After two or three
games playing with the new lineup,
the defense is playing very well to—
gether. Overall. I was pleased with
how we played at Cornell." The
match, in which all 23 soccerwom—
en got playing time, featured four

first—time scorers: Senior Sara
schoen, who had played in the goal
in the first half, as well as {irsr.yeor
players Erin Doyle, Karie Wiltshire
and Mia Devme, who tallied two
goals. wood expressed happiness at
the development of liEl’l’ODkies,add»
ing,“Manyofourfirst—yearsareshow
ing that they're adjusting to the col«
lege game, and playingtime nowwill
help out depth down the road.” The
Pioneers took an early lead on soph»
on-iote strikeriill Paulsen‘s goal. Of
the early start, Wood commented,
“We scored our first goal and added
another right after that, and we
played much more relaxed. We trust
each other and our game plan more
when we have a couple of goals on
the board, and playing relaxed is a
key to our success."

The kickers boosted their C0n<
terence record on Saturday with a 5—
o whitewashing ot Knox. Despite
the lopsided score, Wood expressed
displeasure at the Pioneers’slowstart
against the Frame Fire, stating, “It
was nice to play at home after four
straight games on the road, but we
didn‘t come out ready to play at the
beginning of the match, We needed

mostof the firsthalf to adjust to their
defense. However, after we scored,
everyone relaxed and we were again
able to get everyone playing time.”
Rookies again played an important
role, with Devine and Doyle scoring
and Livi Lenihan netting her first
score at the college level. Senior
Kendra Potz rounded out the scor—
ing with two goals, including the
first tally. Wood noted that the
Knoxseries isone ofthe soccerwoni-
en’s biggest rivalries, adding, “Knox
always comes to Grinnell ready to
play."

Although the Pioneers have
already bested their next two opp0r
nents by lopsided margins, Wood
refused to guarantee victory, Cla|m<
ing, “I expect both teams to come
into town playing better soccer than
the first time we faced them." The
booters will have a week off before
their next game, which will give
them a well—deserved break from
competition. “We’ll be able to get a
littlemorehealingtimeinthisweek,"
Wood added, “and our players who
have been sick or injured will get an
opportunity to work together a little
