many of you may remember. last

not trying to win. what it means is
you will see only a tew posters that
typify my "no-nonsense” cam»
n Basically the SGA deals with

resident I would like to see a more

president who will administer comr
petently and one who will be easily ac~
cesslble 7 less bureaucratic ..lmean
we all pretty well know each other
Hell, why must everthing be so formal
in student government? I would like
SGA'S image to be one that will bring
students mm It, not intlmidate or Scare
them off. It would then be much easter
for individual students to express their
opinions. That is the real issue here 7
how easy it is to input into SGA.

Weu to sum it up, consider me for this
office because I’m as qualified as the
other candidates but mainly because
I‘m a student who wants to see all
students profit by an SGA that‘s just
that — a student government. Not the
US. Senate or a state legislature! As I
said last semester, I'm in the quad
working, in the P,E.C. and even at the
“horn"! Thanks for hearing with me
and remember 7 vote for the candidate
who you think fulfills the two aspects
that I mentioned earlier. Thanks again.

The candidates

Anson Rohr

My name is Anson Rohr and I'm run-
nning for viceepresident at Student
Government Association, Originally
from California, I'm currently a Junior
transfer from the University of Nor~
thern Colorado. I have very little ex
perience in student government, 1 have
always wanted to get involved in stu-
dent government but the opportunity
tor it was just never there. But i honest-
ly teel that college is the place to do the
things one has always wanted to try.
My desire to participate in SGA should
compensate for my inexperience. After
all, everyone has to start somewhere.
No one is horn knowledgeable in
government, it is a learned skill, like
most everything elsein life. And what is
college (Grinneli ln particular) if not an
opportunity for learning new exs
perlences7

A major problem [or SGA is its unapr
proachabllity I believe that most
students don't know what SGA actually
does and, hence, don‘t care about what
it does. This is SGA‘s fault It makes llir
tle effort to educate the student body as
to how it works, I've seen students
come in to Joint Board meetings to re
