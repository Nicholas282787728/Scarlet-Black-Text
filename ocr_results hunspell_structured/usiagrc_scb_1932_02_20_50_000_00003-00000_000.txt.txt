dribbled in fast for two points and a
14—6 lead.

Stringfellow started the
half Drake scoring by driving under
the basket for a tiprup shot, but Frye
and Duncan immediately ran the
score up to 17 to 8.

At this point, Bill Boelter, Bulldog
coach, began substituting by way of
experimentation, and altho Russ 01-
son sank a nifty, wiiile running full
speed, Frye, Rowe, and Ullrieh an»
nexed another two-point marker
apiece to run up a 23710 lead.

Get Set-Ups

The Drake regulars came grimly
back into -the game, but two of their
passes went the wrong way, being
broken up by McCreary and Duncan.
who raced down the floor for set-ups.

with the score against them, 27 to
10, Bulldog nerves steadied, and the
Des Moines team settled down, but
was too far behind to seriously
threaten.

passing Good

Abram started with three points,
and Stringfellow sank two from the
field to give their cohorts 17 points.
Uilricb broke loose for a counter, and
Schultz rendered it nil by following
in a niiiffed free throw attempt.
Mickey Frye‘s short shot, and Smith’s
charity toss ended the scoring.

The Pioneer passing attack was
functioning with the precision shown
often during the season in practice
Scrimmages but seldom in scheduled
games. The Drake five was held al-
most completely in check by the Grille
nell veterans during most of the
game.

' Rowe stars

Don Rowe, although suffering from
a sore hand, played hang-up ball,
while Duncan, Grinnell's little white—
haired boy, went into third place in
conference standings, passing Van
Aokeren, Creighton ace. Defensive
work by Ullrich and McCreth was
one of the game's features.

Pioneer Cage Trio High

in Valley Scoring

Crinnelrs scoring trio, Duncan
Frye, and Rowe, played havoc with
the individual scoring standings in
Missouri Valley conference competi-
tion last night when all three of them
moved up as a result of their activ—
ities in the Drake setto.

Duncan, although held to eight
points, one of his lowest game scores
in recent contests, was good enough
to pass van Ackeren, Creighton Cap—
tain and go into third place, trailing
Collin and Schmidt, Blucjay forward
and center.

Frye and Rowe, who has been resb
ing in eighth and ninth places, found
seven and six points, respectively,
good enough to put them in fifth and
sixth, passing Kiely of Creighton,
Maysack of Washington, and Ley of
the Oklahoma Aggies._

As the conference scoring leaders
now stand, three of the first five are
Creighton men and two are Grinnell
representatives.

Squads Compete
at Ames, Lincoln

ci-inncll college track and swim-
ining teams open their 1932 seasons
today, the trackmen competing on the
indoor cinders at lowa state college,
Amos, while the swimmers carry Pic»
necr colors against the University
of Nebraska at Lincoln.

Neither team was conceded more
than an outside chance to win in ad~
vancc observations. The track squad,
although boasting some individual
stars who should bring in first
places, is not balanced and is particu.
ilarly weak in the field.

The ineligibility of Clark Elbert,
sophomore star, sank whatever hopes
the Pioneer mermen may have enter-
tained for a victory at Nebraska, and
means that when they go against the
Creighton swininmers at Omaha Mon.
day they will be forced to show thcii
best to bring home a winning metre
gin.

Grillnell college department of jour-
nalism, spent Friday at lowa state

“l was allaicl Grandfather
woo d be Séwém’”

 

R E'S rather a bossy old darling,
and I didn‘t know how he’d
like the idea of my smoking.

“The ﬁrst time I lit a Chesterﬁeld
in front of him, he sniffed like an
old war-horse...and I braced myself
for trouble. But all he said was,
'That’s good tobacco, Chickabiddy.’

“You know Grandfather raised
tobacco in his younger days, so he
knows what's what. I don’t, of course
—but I do know that Chesterﬁelds
are milder. It‘s wonderful to be
able to smoke whenever you want,
with no fear you’ll smoke too many.

THEY'RE MILDER I - THEY’RE PURE 0 I

"And it doesn’t take a tobacco
expert to prove that Chesterﬁeld
tobaccos are better. They taste bet-
ter . . . that’s proof enough. Never
too sweet. No matter when I smoke
them . . . or how many I smoke . . .
they always ladle exactly right.

"They must be absolutely pure...
even to the paper which doesn’t
taste at all. In fact...as the ads
say. . .‘Tlsey Satisfy! ’ ”
