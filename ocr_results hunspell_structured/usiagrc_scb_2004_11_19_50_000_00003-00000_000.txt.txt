Online voting runs today
until midnight tonight

If you haven't visited Pioneer Web to vote on
student initiatives yet today, you have until mid
night.

This week's SGA Awareness Week included an ice
cream social before Tuesday's usual Joint Board
meeting, an open forum on Wednesday evening,
and chips and dip in the SGA ofﬁces throughout
the afternoon on Thursday Senators and Cabinet
members also hung out outside the dining halls
during dinners.

In just three days of talking to students at dint
ner, SGA President Mark Henry, ’05 recorded 64
comments, from students wanting a safer campus
to the return of fountain soda in the Forum.

The ice cream social was a hit, too, said Henry.
”We had about six or seven studentsiwho as far
as I know had never been to Joint Board—come
for the ice Cream and end up staying, so that was
encouraging."

Make envi onmental
coordinator posrtion
permanent

Background: Grinncll Collcgc has twicc
made a Commitment to addressing issues of iris
stitutional sustainability by employing two tem-
porary Environmental Coordinators. it should
now make that commitment permanent. In the
pasr three years, Grinnell College has hired two
separate environmental coordinators that served
one-year terms. Both these employees have
been recently graduated students. Brian Turner
(Class of'OZ) served from 20022003 and Dave
Theriault (Class of'04) is currcnrly employed for
the 2004—2005 year,

The temporary environmental coordinators
have added much to the campus.Tlicy have con»
rribllred research on issues as varied as instirue
tional composting and green building, audits of
campus consumption, acted as liaisons to various
stakeholders on campus and provided a central
office for cnvrronmcntal Concerns.

Yet, a temporary employee's impact is inhcrt
cntly limitcd.Thc College would benefit by haw
ing the consistency of a long-term, full—time gm,
ployce. Similarly, the College would gain more
from an Environmcnral Coordinator by hiring a
person with professional training and expcricncc
in the area of institutional sustainability

Because Crinnell administration changed
as smoking policy to make Grinncll college
a smoke free campus, rhcrc was the guarantee
that a smoking lounge would be established for
North Campus and South Campus. Due to the
lack orsufncienr support from many studcnrs
for a smoking lounge on North Campus, the
Student Government Association should den
cide the location of the second smoking lounge
on Grinnell College campus with a committee
consisting of one student from each dorm on

of the Campus Advisory Committee on Envi—
ronmcnral Concerns (EcoCampus> that he is in
support of establishing a permanent Environs
mental Coordinator position. This initiative is
intended to give student encouragement to the
administration to create that position.

Statement of the Initiative: The Grinnell
College administration should make the (amt
porary position of Environmental Coordinator
a permanent, full-time position. The position
should be established with a competitive salary
that will attract professionals who can address
the environmental issues of an institution such
as Grinncll.

Plan of Action: The Snidcnt Government
Association will scnd a lctrcr certifying rhe re-
sults of this initiative to President Osgood and
Nord Bruc, Chair of the Board of'l'rustces,

Thc smdcnt GovernmentAssociation along
with the Campus Advisory Committee on En-
vironmcnral Conccrns (ECoCampus) will work
with President Osgood and other members of
the administration to submit the necessary buds

create a fullrzimc posirion for an Environmental
Coordinator,

Add buffer
days

Background: Since the sui—
cides that occurred in the spring
of 2003, Grinncll Collcgc crcr
axed a Mental Health Task Force
in the fall of2003 to examine the
status of emotional and men-
tal health on campus and rhe
resources available (0 students
One of the primary recomment
dations from the Mental Health
Task Force is the implementation
of buffer days before exams. In
addition ro the suggestions from
the Mental Health Task Force,
many of Grinnell College’s peer
institutions of higher learning al-
ready have at leasr one day or an
cnrirc week as a reading period
prior to exams, including Carr
leton College, Wesleyan Uni-
versity, Duke University, Smith
college, Harvard Collcgc, Am-
hcrsi College, Yale University,

Make darkroom
space available

Statement: The College should
consider providing photographic
facilities and resources as a priority,
and the College should commit to
creating or finding a space for a trat
ditional, black and white film pro-
ccssing darkroom.

Backgroun In past ycars,
a black and white film darkroom
was aimilable to students through
rhe Craft Workshop, facilitated by
the Office of Smdcnt Affairs and
maintained by students. The Craft
Workshop, formerly housed in the
basement of Derby, was displaced
whcn rhc building was demolished
and was nor relocated due to space
limitations. There were plans to int
crude a darkroom in the new campus
center, but due to budget cuts that is
no longer a possibility, The College
has no formal curricular photograr
phy classes, and although there are
possibilities for incorporating digital
photography courses into the Art
Department, traditional black and
white photography is still neglected.
The one darkroom that does exist,
in the publications building, has or
rrcmcly limited space (one enlarger)
and is or substandard quality. This
darkroom is also restricted to $83
and the yearbook staffers due to
legitimate security concerns about
tlic publications building. Thus,
the campus cntircly lacks adequate
black and white film processing
and printing facilities open to all
students. Beginning next semest
tcr, the crafr Workshop will oper~
ntc a digital photography class, but
the absence ofa darkroom is still a
problem. Digital photography and

Statement of the Initia-
tive: Given the intensity of the
last week of classes, the recom—
mendation of butter days by rhe
Mental Healrh Task Force, and
their implementation at peer int
siirutions of higher learning, we,
as the Grinnell College student
body, propose the implementa-
tion ofonc or rwo buffet days be-
tween the end of classes and the
final examination period.

Plan ofAct-ion: We propose
that a group of students, faculty,
staff, administrators and rhe reg-
isrrar convene to determine the
best way to schedule buffer days
as part of the Grinnell College
academic calendar.

Gr nnell Photo Soc ety

film photography are different
artistic processes, each with rheir
benefits and disadvantages, and
both should be considered dcsircd
by the students. Many students
come to Grinnell with background
ordarkroom phorography and de—
sire to continue that interest here,
even ifin an indcpcndcnr capacity,
Not having a darkroom on campus
is a concern felt by current Grin-
nell students, and will continue to
be an issue, as students coming to
Grinnell will expect a school ofour
caliber to have a quality film Pm,
cessing and printing facility.

Plan of Action: There has been
a waliant effort in Student Affairs
to keep the Photography Craft
Workshop, as well as the Ceramr
ics Craft Workshop, functioning.
We appreciate these efforts and
recognize that space reducrions
limit everyone. However, rhc main
goal of this initiative is to illustrate
the interest students have in phm
rography in general, and especially
black and white photography. We
would like to cxprcss concern that
traditional film photography not
be de—emphaslzed and abandoned
in the wake ofdigital photography.
Evcry attempt should be made to
utilize the Craft Workshop equip
ment now in storage, or find a way
to make the publications’ darkroom
hilly funcrional and usable,withour
infringing on the newspaper or the
yearbook. For rhc long term, we
ask the College to reserve a space
for a darkroom in the future and
make a commitnieut to establish»

ing a high quality facility.
