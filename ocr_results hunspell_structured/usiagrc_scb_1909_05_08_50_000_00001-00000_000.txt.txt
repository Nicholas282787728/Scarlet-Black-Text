The contest was remarkable in that
nearly every speaker had A style so
distinctive that it was very difficult
(a make comparisons. Some excelled
in voice, some in gesture, some in

earnestness and some in grace, ﬂuency,

magnetism and the other Qualities

Consequently there was a tendency,

at least on the part Of the audience,
'to place the speakers according n; the
nezl'ness of their approach to each
person’s fﬂVDrile style. The wideli'

was true at them. The contest was
close and interesting throughout and

The first speaker was W. H. Young,

'12, who gave a portion of Henry Van-
Dyke's address on “Salt." Mr, Young
was the only Freshman to make the
ﬁnals and, though he showed the lack
of the experience at some of the Otllr
ers, his work was or high order.
There was a ring or s

excellent voice that “as very effec-

neriiy ‘in his

ture in this wori.

R. L. Hai-tson, '11, spoke next on
“John Brown," He showed an excel
lent command of the technical riiioli»
ties of the speaker and his delivery
was finished and expressive, though

perhaps a trifle elocntionary,

thoughttul and discriminating.
E. A. cupp, ’11, was the third spedlr
er, his subject being “Cardinal niche-
lieu." Probably no speaker partici-
pating possessed more magnetism and
had the pleasing stage presence that
was Mr. Cupp's. His voice was rich,
expressive, and or very pleasing qual-
ity. His speech seemed to demand
more vigor than was given it, the
speakers style not being well adapted
to this type or selection.

The iourth speech was by J. G. Moore,
'10, His speech was on “The Conillct
of the Ages" (between selfishness and
altruism), the lirst part being a flea
clamation, and the latter portion or-
iginal, it was evident that Mr.
Moore’s style was more that of a lie
bater than of an orator, his strong rea-
tnre being his denunciations and argu-

mentative passages, His gestures

es that go to make up the speaker
and he appealed to his auditors more
iinitornily than did his competitors.
While the others were specialists in
their particular styles, the winner of
first place was possessor ol Sufficient
strength, a good voice, an easy and
pleasing appearance and iorcefiil pre-
sentation. He won through his unis
tei-y over all phases of delivery.

manding personality left no room to
doubt but that he would place. He
gave the impression of great depth
and spoke “as one having authority,"

With a strong voice, forcelul gestures
and marked animation he made a very
ei'iective speech.

The last speech was by L. M. Thomp

A capacity house, mfuiy of them who
had seen the organized company in the
plai. received the production so u‘arnr
ly that there leaves no doubt but what
they judged the work in comparison
with the standard of amateur acting
as it is known in Grinnell, and not
uith the work oi protessional actors,

The play is one or the better known
wins or the day. being a simple plot
involving a young American girl and
boy who had been sent abroad to get
some noblei- things from life. Their
miscoiiceived ideas of what the noble
things are, which they think consti-
tutes an alliance with foreign titles oi
nobility, gets them into troublc. They
try to get the sanction of a guardian
iroin indiaiia to an alliance with two
foreign titles which they have run
across in old Italy. He complicates
matters by appearing on the scene and
incidentally getting entangled with an
escaped Russian convict who eventunk
ly aids him with the help of the Rus-
sinn Duke whom he met “in cognito"
to irustrate the plans of the so-called
nobility. As Daniel Voorhees Pike, the

must have 1| four year-5' course instead
of only a. law months its formerly. and
that the same was true of the other
professions.

The idea that a broader, more liberal
and extended education was as neces-
sary fol" women as ior men was
brought out time and again. The home
was upheld as the highest place tor
womankind, but the idea that wives
do not need as much education as their
husbands, was scorned.

The true value 01 culture and edu-
cation was heid to be in increased ca-
pacity for service. “Better Prepare:

dress.
