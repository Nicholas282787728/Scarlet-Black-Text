The president believes that the
present men's gym can be re-
modeled for about $10,000 and so
can serve as a women's physical
education eenter until a new and
separate unit can be built at a
later date.

At the present time there is
about a $33,000 fund for the
building of a women's gymnast
um. Eighteen thousand dollars of
this amount was left of the in-
surance from the gymnasium fire
after equipment losses had been
dedueted, Stevens said.

A physical education unit for

be impossible to launch such a
program in the immediate future,

pite the fact that the Pio-
ntcis turned in easy wins over
Monmouth and Knox ii their
openers, there is still a lot of
uroih to be done on both offense
and defense,

In the game with Monmouth.
Grinnell’s cagers relied almost en»
tii-ely on long shots for their
points. Mohmouth's defense held
back and let the Pioneer sharp-
shooters take their time on their
shots, thus accounting for the
high percentage/of good ones.
Griunell vs. Knox,

In their tangle with Knox at

Wile.

Galesliiirg, Grimell kept their one-,

outrof-three average during the
first halt, but fell down during
the second period, out of the four
halres played in the two games
there was probably one that dis-
played a. Grinnell five capable of
winning the championship, the
first half of the Knox game The
Pioneers were working their of-
fease plays successfully and bot-
tling up the opponents when on
the defense.

Charts of the shots taken dur-
ing this period show that prac-
tically all of the points were made
by shots in close to the basket.
while the other three periods
featured shots from anywhere on
the floor.
