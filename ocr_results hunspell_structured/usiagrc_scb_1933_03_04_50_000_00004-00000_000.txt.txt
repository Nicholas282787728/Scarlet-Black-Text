In trying to understand the various
conflicts that rage within the breast
of a college student at the present
moment in China, it is well to hear
in mind both the strident environment
and viewpoint. There has been a
great deal of misapprehension in the
minds oi the public generally as res
gards the ”patriotic work" which
students felt they must undertake.
The evel'rchanging and unstable Cone
ditions of the Chinese government'
have encouraged boldness in the sm—
dent movement. To Westerners, many
of the resulting actions have appear-
ed nonsensical or unduly radical.

Attempt (D Interpret

This article is an attempt, on the
part of one student, to interpret fan‘s
ly the numerous patriotic activities
among the students in China today,
In the first place, the successes which
have result-ed from various student
movements during times of national
crisis in the past have given students
encouragement to continue to partici-
pate in poll ‘cal affairs.

Second, students wish to arouse the
spirit of patriotism among their peo—
ple who still remain ignorant that
china is facing one of the most criti—
cal moments in her national history.

Promote Boycott

Third, they wish to promote a
thorougli»going boycott of Japan, so
that in the event of China's failure
to match licr enemy in military
strength, she may defeat her by
economic measures,

Then, lastly, we wish t o convey to
the active participants in Chinats
lines of defense that they are not
alone in the struggle, but that the
whole intellectual class is behind them
and wishes to encourage them in their
brave fight for the protection of their
country. .

started Movement in 1919

Let us look back to see what active
part the students have taken in the
melding of China's history these re»
cent years, The student movement is
generally considered to have started
in 1919, when a group of pro»Japan-
ese ministers in the Peking Govern-
ment wished to abide by Japan's de-
mands for Shantung at the Peace
conference in Paris. However. this
was boldly denounced by students of,
Peking university, who started a‘
movement in which they were later!
joined by students of other univer -
ties of Peking, to turn those disloya.
men out of office. This resulted in a!
sympathetic response from all parts

' of China, and backed by this support}

the students may be credited with a
large share in the return of Shantuiig
1i.0\ he to China. The student move-

_ merit was first instituted for political

reform but later on. s it spread, it
took on the phase oi nationwide at-
tempt to rouse to a sense oi national
consciousness the mass of the Chin
esc people

51‘ -t Agitation

When in 192 the Japanese lulled
several Clinic e workmen in their
weaving mi s in Shanghai, the stir
dents started an agitation which di-
rccted its energies to the boycott oi
Japan and Great Britain, then coils
sidered to he a powerful ally of
Japan and of imperialism generally
This boycott was very effective, for
during 1925 Blitish trade was exceed-
ingly )1;tl'd»hlt by a strike which lasts
ed for 14 months, and resulted in a
compromise on both sides.

Perhaps our greatest weapon fol;
defense has been the boycott. It has
brought success in the past, why not
now It is spreading like a wild
flame throughout the country. It has
been successful in striking hard at
Japanese trade during past years.
students have taken a very active
part in this, and the whole country is
gradually becoming “boycott-con-
Scions", from the humble rickshaw
puller to the highest ofiicial. A boys
cott is not easy to enforce, nor can

it he put into force as quickly as one!
could wisli.- Its success depends upon]

the support of the mass of the peo-
ple, but many are poor in China, while
the public memory is so short that it
must he continually spurred by in-
tense stimulation. Now, however, in
all the great cities we find societies
for the salvation of the Nation by
Boycott working out plans of pro-
cedure and perhaps it is not too much
to say that the students have been
the living spirit of the movement.
Support-ed Kuomilltfulg

In 1926 stumms actively supported
the Kuomintang National party in
its attempt to overthrow militarism
in China and unite the country under
the central government of Nanking
After the‘establishment of the Nat-
ionalist regime at Nanking, the stu-
dent patriotic movement remained
quiescent, but the sudden attack on
Mukden, the outrageous violation of
the neutrality of the International
Settlement in shanghai, and this last
capture of Shanhaikwon have again
stirred patriotic feeling in student
circles to fever pitch. In the face of
this active Japanese aggression, the
students have been striving to decide
upon the right course of action, for
they sense a twofold dutyronc in
pursuing their studies quietly with-
out involving themselves in political
affairs, and the other ‘ii endeavorin
to arouse the spir t of patrioti.
within every single Chinese breast in
the country.

In order to understand why this
patriotic spirit is iiot vital and glow-
ing in eve-y Chinese heart, we must

Stars in 46-24

Led by Harry DilMont, flashy 'sophr
oinoi-e cage star, the freshman ira .
kothall team outclassed the Marshall—
town junior college quintet to win its
second game of the season last night,
46 to 21, in a curtain—raiser to the
Grinneil-St. Louis tilt

The preps held a decided advantage
over their opponents during the en-
tire game and managed to display a
brand of playing that would do cred
it to any college varsity. In the first
half especially the frosh ' ran wild,
holding a. 27 to 5 margin at the end
of the period Not until several min-
utes of the game had elapsed were
the Morshalltown cagers able to score
a basket.

Fouls Arc Numerous

Personal fouls were quite numer-
ous with the Grinnell men being at:—
cused of Is and the visitors commit.

enough gratis shots good to score one-
lialf of its points in this manner,
while the preps made 10 free shots
drop through the hoop.

Nearly every member of coach Les.
ter Wall’s squad was given a chance
to play and out of the 12 playing nine
contributed to the scoring DuMont
was high point man with 13 points
while Klepfer and Palmer ranked
second with nine apiece.

Play Even in second

‘ Coach Warren Dickerson's men
played a better style game in the sec-
ond period to account for 16 points
and held the props to 19 counters.
walker, blond scrappcr for the visr
tors, led the scoring for his team-
mates with five frce throws and a

Japan Tightens Grip

keep students eiitiroly out of

studies would perhaps, be ideal, but
this is iinpossihle in china at the
present time.

The world has ivrshed to encourage
China to maintain her passive atti-
tude and rely on assistance from the
League of Nations. Alter a year and
a half of useless waiting we find
iJapan ever tightening her grip on
'China, anrl we find students possess—
ed by a fiery emotion hard to sup
pro The patriotism of Chinese stu-
dents is finding various forms of ex-
pression; many kinds of patriotic ac'
tivitics are being carried on and
those who icel most deeply the call to
put their lives at the service of their
country have gone to volunteer in
the armies with the hope of carrying
inspiration and courage to those who
are fighting, Fol: our soldiers do need
encouragement. Although we have
armies they do not consist wholly of
intelligent, patriotic soldiers who
fight from an impetus within them,
Many join the army merely as a
means of securing a livelihood, so
poverty-stricken is their status, Can
we expect from them as much true
national fervor as from those who
fight solcly ior love of country? No,
it is impossible, So those students
who cannot suppress the urge that is
in them are joining the volunteer
armies at the front, to sacrifice their
lives if they must in their desire to
prove to China's soldiers that the
whole Chinese notion is behind them
and that we Chinese are not wasting
our energies in internal eivrl strife,
but are uniting against a dangerous
foe that threatens to strike at the
very heart of our national life,

 

Norris Explains
Evolution Theory

to Workers Club

H, w, Norris, research professor of
zoology, gave an illustrated slide lecv
turc on “WhaL is Evollltion7” before
the workers cooperative college, at
the Uncle Sam's club, Wednesday
evening at 5 o'clock.

Using his repertoire of charts anti
bones, Professor Nor illustrated the
biologic relationships oi the human
hand to the {market of animals and
the wings of birds.

l-le explained that most of what
science knows about evolution is
theory. and not absolute fact, but
that the principle of evolution (the
dealelltiol' as ent7—of man from
lower forms) is now accepted and,
for the most part, undisputed.

“The hows of evolution are not
known for sure," stated Professor
Nor ' “and, of course, the whys are
altogether unknown. Really, evolution
stimulates us to Lhink of what we
don’t know. Our ignorance is appal-
ling, biit this ignorance is loss than in
the past."

In his lantern slrdc talk Professor
Nol is also presented the evolution
of the horse, the elephant. and man.
