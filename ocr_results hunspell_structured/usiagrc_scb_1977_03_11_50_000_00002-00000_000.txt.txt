From 1955 until a few months
ago, Richard J, Daley had been in
almost total control ol the city of
Chicago. His death last December
ielt a power vacuum that caused
political in-tighting which greatly
threatened the stability of the city.
Though temporary stability seems
to have been achieved for the
present, there is no way to predict
the future.

John Fish and Lou Palmeri
representatives of the ACM Urban
Studies Program—were on
campus Tuesday to discuss the
impact Daley‘s death will have on
the ruture of Chicago They ieei
that little will change in the way
Chicago government operates,
although the political machine
itselt may undergo alteration.

The myth that Chicago is a city
which “works well” is only true for
certain groups, Fish commented.
He believes that the political
machine does satisiy the interests
of the big corporations and labor
unions based in the city, “But for
Ordinary neighborhood in-
stitutions, Chicago does not work
well," he said. In general, “the
goal of the political machine is not
to create a better City, but to stay
in power," he commented.

Lou Palmer, a black iournallst

 

and radio personality as well as an
associate of the Urban Studies
Program, asserted that although
Daley was an extraordinary man
and a political genius, the political
machine remains intact without
him. He noted that immediately
after Daley‘s death the city's
various ethnic groups began
caucusing to plan their strategies
tor “grabbing a piece of
power." ’

Michael Bilandic, the stolidly
loyal, machine alderman of
Daley's lrishCathoiic ward, was
chosen interim mayor by the City
Council until the general election
to be held in April Although he
earlier announced that he would
not seek the Job on a per-
manent basis, Bilandic has since
entered the mayoral race. Some
Chicagoans believe Bilandic is
being manipulated by eleventh
ward Irish Catholics and Daley’s
sons, There also is speculation that
one of Daley's sons will seek the
Democratic nomination for mayor
in 1979.

Facing Bilandic, the machines
endorsed candidate, will be the
Polish community's Roman
Pucinski, and Harold Washington,
a black state senator Washington
has gained support not only from
black leaders, hut from many
white liberals, independent of the

machine.

Chicago's blacks constitute the
single largest group in a cr‘r
where power is based on ethnic
background. While the Polish and
IrishrCatholics hold the most
political power, the black com-
munity, comprising over a third of
the city's population, holds little
power. But now, for the first time,
the possibility or a black mayor is
real.

Since Daley became mayor, the
machine, in order to stay in power,
has sought and received support
from the city's black wards. But
poverty and blatant segregatiﬁ
have continued throughout the
city Thus, in the past decade,
Chicago’s black leaders have
grown alienated from the machiii
they formerly supported.

Both Fish and Palmer believe
that there is a good chance that
Bilandic will not win,
Washington may win, which
Palmer said would be more
shocking than the mayor’s death.

in next month's election, the
machine faces what may be its
most important test at strength
ever. The most powerful bigrcity
political machine in the country
may be replaced by another, less
powerful form of machine or by a
badly-needed progressive city
government. ‘

Record Service returns

by Tom Lowciiiiurg

In late February, the Joint Board
approved a proposal to reinstitute
the Record Service under the
auspices of the SGA.

Rhoda Moskowitz and Seth
Hollander, both former workers
under the KDIC setup, were ape
pointed comanagers and asked to
prepare a proposal to be submitted
to SGA for approval. The proposal
was accepted at the March 2 SGA

» meeting and last Sunday the new
Record Service began operation

KDIC operated the Record Sci”
vice from 1972 until December 6 of
last year, Grinnell was written up
In Billboard magazine several
years ago because it was the first
college in the country to institute
such a SerVice

which were very small in the
overall station operating budget,
were not worth the effort involved.
Last semester. one of the service's
comanagers was forced to borrow
against his personal funds, and at
one point. the legal status of the
service was challenged,

In addition, the Student
Publications and Radio Committee
felt that while students ape
preciated the service, it was not
part or KDIC’s tunctions to
operate the venture, At the end of
last semester it asked SGA to
assume the responsibilities for the
Record Service.

The new setup resembles the old
one. with a icw . changes. The
distributor has changed irorn

 

Sound Unlimited to Galgano Dist.
Co, because Sound Unlimited
lrequently delivered warped
records and allowed only a small
portion to he returned. Galgano’s
prices are insignificantly higher,
but it will buy back all rejects
received by the service. The new
price ior students is now $4.45 per
record, a twenty cent increase/but
still a bargain.

The location was changed to the
area opposite the Forum desk, arﬁ,
the operating hours are now '
Sunday 3:304:30 pm, and Monday
6:304:30 pm. Delivery of orders
takes a week, _

Moskowitz and Holland‘SV
welcome any suggestions from th
student body.
