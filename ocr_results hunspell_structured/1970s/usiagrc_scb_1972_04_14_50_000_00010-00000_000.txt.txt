Dismal Weather, Dismal! Meet For Track

by Chris Mndson

Track activity for (lie Gi'innell
Trotters was at a low ebli last
weekend. The Cornell Relays, sche
edllled tor Saturday, were cancelled
on Friday night so Coach Obe spent
the night trying to sci‘ounge another
meet. At the last second, C08 01‘-
ganized (?) a triangular that included
our squad and team irom Luther.
The weather was uninspiringrlhirly-
live degrees and cloudy-and most
oi the performances were adequate
ii unexcililig, Jollil llessliurg set a
new personal record with n 53.3
quarter, and Jim Pirolli ran a pro-
mising leg on the mile relay. There
are rumors that Plrolli is about to
ezlrn himselt a permanent place on
the mile relay-should he a nice
warm-down alter the 440 intern
mediates. Chuck MCGmth was the
utility man in the meet, running two
mile races and :l tllreeemile. There
were no tean scores kept which,
from what most of the Grinilell run»
ners said, was probably just as
well; Luther ran away with most or
the events.
