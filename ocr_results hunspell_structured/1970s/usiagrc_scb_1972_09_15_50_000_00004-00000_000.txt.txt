New Priority:
Making Priorities

This is the time of year when people in student government
and other interested citizens get out their adding machines,
punch away at the keys, shuffle papers, debate priorities,
question other people in student government and debate some
more. The process has been going on for a week now and will
continue for several days more. The end result: the Student
Government Association budget for the 197243 school year
(or, more precisely, for the semester).

$29,375, perhaps a little more, will be divided up per semi

ester among a variety of student activities With that amount
of money involved, students should be concerned about the
process by which the allocations, all-important for the sup
port of many student services, will be made.

The system, unfortunately, is all too much oriented toward
the past. II this year is typical of years previous, and there
is no reason to believe why it should not be, the Finance Com-
mittee examines the budgets of students services for pres
vious years, takes into account the changing nature ofa few
of the activities, and allocates funds along the same general
lines.

The program is almost predictable: the Committee will
have its annual Great Debate Over Salaries (what is the jusr
tification for paying some students salaries? Is it legal to
cut a person‘s salary after he has already been appointed?
How can we evaluate the performance of SGA personne17),
it will probably talk about the fact that hall funds frequently
go for hall booze parties (which is, of course, strictly against
college regulations), it will talk about raising the student
activity fee. But when all is said and done, the Committee
will recommend a budget remarkably similar to last year‘s,
and the Joint Board, after driving the same set of debates
into the ground, will approve-~unanimously.

And so the budget will be determined.

Questions must arise, however, about the process just out—

lined, for if budgets are based primarily on past budgets,
which are based on past budgets, then in effect the decisions
about what is important for students to spend their collective
funds on has been made in the past, without consideration
of present needs. There is no careful analysis of how the
student body as a whole wishes its money to be Spent.

To take an example: the funds allocated the Scarlet and
Black. The 8&3 share of student funds, while not approaching
the amount given to the Social Coordinating Committee, is
still relatively substantial: probably $3,250 this semester.
Students should consider whether or not the expenditure is
worth it. If the SliB provides only, say, 20 minutes of reading
entertainment per student per Friday, general opinion might
prefer that the money be spent on the radio station or for rock
concerts.

The difficulty, it seems, is in the process of comparing
expenditures. Should the student body in general wish to de»
lete, say, $1,000 a semester from the Scarlet and Black
budget, to which activity should the $1,000 go?

For the answer to this question we can retreat, as a last
resort, to economics. The funds should be dispersed, the ecor
nomist would say, on the basis of the value to which the stu-
dent body collectively assigns each service. The funds to
each activity would thus be equal to the aggregate of the value
of marginal benefit which each student would receive.

This formulation has little utility in our present situation,
but it does provide a way of going about the problem: Ina
school of our size surely the student government should be
able to derive some sort of figures concerning the value
which students place on the various student activities.Whether
by questionnaire or by all—campus voting or by selective poll~
ing, some indication of student preference should be attained.

The limiting case, of course, would be where the students
would determine that they would rather not have any student
activities at all and have their money refunded, for the “mar
ginal benefit” of student activities in general may be con-
siderably below the activity tee.

But however it is done. student government should begin
to consider the possibility that the evaluations made long ago
may not still be true, and that rather than look to the past
for information concerning budget priorities, the more pro
ductive way of going about it might be to examine the pre-
ference structure of students how at the college. The new
analysis might, after all, do nothing more than justify the
present division of funds and eliminate the uncertainty which
now exists. If not, then we may set ourselves on the road
to a more rational spending policy, based on the desires of
present students, not past ones.

Barlleii: Costa Rica Enthusiast

(Ed. note: Peggy Barlett, aGrin»
hell graduate in the class of 1969,
recently wrote the following letter to
Professor of Economics Robert
Voertman concerning her present
work in Costa Rica. While a student
at Grinnell she participated in the
ACM Costa Rican Semester, with
which Mr. Voorlman has been close—
ly involved. Voertman reminds stu—
dents that applications for the prOr
gram can be obtained from his of-
fice at any time.)

Dear Mr, Voertman,

It’s been Ll long time since I have
communicated witil you, but my life
since Grinnell has gone more or
less as expected, I just finished
my third year of course work at
Columbia and have finished my Ph.D.
exams, This summer Ihave (obs
viously) been teaching at Queens
and enyoying il a great deal.

I have ]ust received a grant from
NIMH for the dissertation proposal
I am sending you. ll amazes me how
much my interests have come to
parallel the topic of research that
ACM Set me to do in CR in 1968,
Peasant decision—making was some
thing I knew little about and even
less how to research. Hopefully, with
a little more sophistication, I can
get closer to answering those kinds
of questions this time. I did a
summer’s research In Ecuador in
1970, studying an Indian village in
the highlands and trying to under-
stand the broad processes of social

change in the valley The Green
Revolution and problems with the
“package” approach in India have

also kindled my interest in seeing
exactly what is going on with agris
cultural innovation on the locallevel
in Cosh Rica

l have written the proposal for the
Tarooles Valley becausel would
rather spend the bulk of my time
there than in San Isidro or Guans
acaste. But I am completely open
about where in that general good
grain area l would find avillagethat
has used the new methods to a
measurable degreelorh yearsor so.
Any suggestions would be very wel-
come

I have Written Bob Hunter sever-
al times over the past year as this
project was being conceived. Unforr
iunaiely, 1 think only one letter got
there, and of course, I was being
very sceptical about the projects
being funded because money is so
tight for Anthro research. Now that
lam Sure I”ll be in Costa Rica
sometime around Sept. 15, I will
write him again soon.

Although it has been said Over and
over, I want to reiterate that my
6 months in CR have continued to
be extremely valuable all through
my graduate work and my a months
in Ecuador would not have been so
profitable had I not already had
fieldwork experience.

Moulder: Criticizes Hansen View

To the Editors:

Mr. Hansen’s article could apply
to any small liberal arts college
in a rural lown, His typically blase,
pseudo intellectual, scornfulattitude
shows an embarrassingly narrow
prospective. This attitude isunfalr-
ly degrading to the communily. The
antagonisms between the town and
the college have reached mythical
proportions. In three years and
one summer in Grinnell I have been
treated with nothing but common
decency by the townspeople.

Mr. Hansen states that the “exis
tence of the Student body transforms
this sleepy midwestern town into a
living college community.” I wish
to point out that there exists a
complex interdependence between
the town and the college. While the

student body contributes to the “live
ing college community" by its pre~
sence in Grinnell during the school
year, the actual connection between
the college and the town exists in-
dependently of each passing class.

Mr. Hansen searched futilely “for
diversion and amusement within the
delicate context of boredom." Per
haps it is his own failure to realize
the potential of the townspeople to
offer not only the opportunity to
experience a life different from that
of the college community, but also
friendship.

! challenge Mr. Hansen to prove
that the Grinnell College mentality
is of any higher quality than the
“townie mentality."

Women’s Group Unstructured

by Michelle Casey

Presentation of the film Growing
Up Female during New Student Days
began this year’s activities for the
Women’s group, Since then, a few
meetings have been held for inter
ested persons to discuss plans for
the year.

The Women’s group is very loosely
structured with no definite leads
ershlp, A few experiencedmembers
have been organizing and leading
the meetings, but they feel this will
change as others become more in-
volved. Meetings are tentatively
Scheduled for Sunday afternoons.

One of the main goals the group
hopes to achieve this year is the
establishment of an effective coun-
seling service covering the areas
of birth control, pregnancy, venereal
disease, and homosexuality Pre-
viously, the women had office hours
for counseling purposes when they
found ineffectual. While the group
will have an office soon, they plan
lo use phones, including some pri-
vate lines as the basis of a more
effective counseling service

The group is pushing for a birth
control clinic which would serve the
women froln Foweshiek county, Ins
eluding Grinnell, and three other
countles The idea has beendiscuss-
ed for a number of years, and the
need for a clinic has been recog

nized. ‘
Planned Parenthood is no longel

Applications are now being
accepted for positions on the
Senior Year Committee, the
Sludenl Coordinator's Office
has announced Olllyseniorsare
eligible for membership. All
applications should be m to the
son office by 400 pm. on
Friday, September 22

women in the group who have been
trained will teach others interested
in counseling. Tentative plans have
been made by the group to buy

and distribute on campus a handbook
on birth control and another on VD.

Efforts are being made toestablish
consciousness raisinggroupstodis-
cuss sex and social roles. The
groups formed will be set up on
a personal level from a contact
Sheet of people who have indicated
interest, with both single Sex and
mixed groups planned.

Other programs for the year are
all in the planning stage. Last year
the group held a week long seminar;
so far they plan to spread out ac»
tivities mcrc this year.

One committee is considering films
that might be Shown at Grinnell.
Speakers are also under Consider~
ation. One possibility mentioned was
Louise Noun, a Grinnell alumnawhu
resides in Des Moines. She is the
author of Strong Minded Women, 3
book about the emergence of the
women’s suffrage movement In Iowa

Some women want to stage a guer-
iIla theatre production which they
created for the Women in the Law
course for the entire campus. The
producliou covers laws on rape;
prostitution, and homosexuality.

Riddle: Mistaken
Nixon ’68 Vote

(Ed. note: Mrs. Sigrid Riddle is
the mother of Carol Riddle, who
graduated from Grinnell in 1967.
in a letter accompanying the one
printed below, she noted that at her
daughter’s graduation Senator
George McGovern gave the com-
rnencemeni address, “whichwas ex-
cellent." She urges students and
faculty to register and lo vote since
“your letters, speeches and peace
demonstrations will have been in
vain if you do not vote.”

”Our influence,” she says, “does
count. We must use it wisely and
well."

To the Editors:

We listened to the acceptance

speech oi'Richard Nixon four years
ago. He promised a quick and to
our involvement in the War in Viet-
nam. (He had a secret plan). Many
of us believed him than and voted
for him in 1968. We are now said»
dened and disillusioned and we have
vowed that we shall never makethat
mistake again! He cannotcontinueto
deceive the American people and
keep their trust.

We know that President Nixon
could. as Commander-in-Chief,
have stopped the bombing andended
our involvement in the war long ago
if he had desired to do so. Such
courageous action would haven'lade
it possible for the Prisoners ofWar
to come home. But, ”saving face"
was much more important to him.

The administration has prolonged
the war and greatly intensified the
bombing. It is appalling to rea»
lize how many human beings have
had their homes destroyed andtheir
bodies shattered during those years
ofagony!

We repudiate this Dishonorable
War and all of the gran, corrup-
tion and profiteering that it thrives
upon!
