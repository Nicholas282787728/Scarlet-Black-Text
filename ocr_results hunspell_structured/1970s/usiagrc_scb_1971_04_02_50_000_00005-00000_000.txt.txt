A LEAP column by Glenn Vanstrum

Why is the human race still

careening down the road of
environmental disaster in
spite of general acknowledg-
ment of the seriousness ofthe
problem? It's not apathy -
most of us really docareabout
the choking smog we encount-
er in our cities. It’s not hopes
lessness * "Oh,scientistsare
inventing stuff, anti-this. res
cycliblerthat, organic what-
ever.” What, then, is it? is
it just the megarcorporations,
GM, ATEtT, etc., who do all
the polluting? If you've ever
ridden in a car or used city
sewer facilities, you should
know the blame rests on each
of us (cars contributed 60%
of est. U.S.airpollution,munr
icipal sewers add a similar
percent of water pollution).

Please don’t think about pol-
lution; don’t worry about it;
don‘t feel guilty about it. Rae
ther, do things about it.

3 EASY THINGS YOU CAN
DO TO HELP OUR ENVIRON-
MENT:

I) When your room gets 5
degrees colder because of
those damned LEAP people,
before you complain, PUT ON
A HAT r 50% of body heat is
radiated from the head. lfthis

lower temperature level (71
degrees) can be maintained,
our bankrupt college willsave
thousands of dollars per
annum of smelly, glorky fuele
oil.

2) When you eat Saga, use
your head and TAKE ONLY
WHAT YOU CAN EAT. One
ton of waste food is thrown
away from students plates
every three days. It is a vic-
ious circle - Saga food tastes
lousy, students waste, Saga
loses money, maintains lousy
food. Jerry promises better
chow if current tons of food
stop getting wasted.

3) DIVIDE YOUR TRASH so
it can be recycled. Leap has
two extra receptacles at each
trash site a one for clean
newspaper and magazines, one
for clean paper. Clean means
free from food scraps,
stepped- on mud, plastic stuff.
It is all right if there is Writ;
ing on it. The college canmake
money selling this in Des
Moines. .

So, to stop the rape ofMother
Earth requires action, not
thought. STOP being an Am—
erikan-thrower-awayer. Be
an Earthman. And don'tworry,

Mnrtyr’s Weekend Activities Set

by Lawrence Wright

Martyr's Weekend is an ef-
fort by the Black students of
Grinnell Campus to deal with
an important part of our life-
style *- our attitudes about
death. it is a time when we
dedicate ourselves to the st-
ruggle for which many Blacks
have died- our liberation.

Black lives in America are
counted worthless by the es-
tablishment, the nonestablishr
ment, and by everybody else
in America except Black peo~
ple. But we, as a colonized
people, are not in a position
to change this pattern of pos-
sibility of death at any time.
This is a good deal of what it
means to be Black in Amer—
ica; Black people internalize
a rationalization which allows
them to accept this fact: that
the white community, on any
whim, may take steps to com-
pletely eliminate us. As long
as white is right, America is
white and White America will
be a personal hell for all
Black souls. So it is with this
in mind that we once again
seek to dedicate ouruncertain
lives to the struggle to guar-
antee life and peace for those
who are to follow us into the
long, lonely canyons of White
America.

State University will be our

A Dirty Story

that folks can get worked up
by issues that, whilevital,are
longrrange, and, at the same
time, can destroy what should
be a nice place simply to save
(by my count) exactly fourte n
steps to the post office.

Not to limit my wrath on this
issue, I am also amazed that
B&G continues to drive 12* foot
wide trucks on sixrfoot wide
sidewalks. This is producing
large ditches on either side
pn the sidewalk to the point
that Jack Doppelt fell in one
and was lost for two days. Why
do we need those large ditches,
or for that matter, do we need
large
grass?

Now I like grass. (Greg But’
cher pointed out that there may
be possible misunderstand
ings about that fact). I also
like most people and I once
had a crush on a Mack truck.
I am even in favor of people
walking on grass, as long as
both the people and the grass
can take it. What lam asking
is that we think a little bit
more about ecology * the life
going on around us , so they
won't have to cement every
thing over around here.

director of Black Studies at
the school and is a pioneer in
the search for relevant educa-
tional experiences for Black
students who often suffer (and
at Grinnell, too) from the ten-
sion of being out of harmony
with an education experience
designed to either eliminate
or destroy them -* a system
which either defines them in
shades of nonfunctional gray
which are never called legi-
timate in a whiteman'sworld,
or one that openly seeks desr
troy them by superimposing
traits on them which are de-
signed to make them stag-hate
and die.

The second event ofthe week-
end is commonly called a soul
food bazaar. This is not quite
accurate, the market in Iowa
being what it is, so we’re do-
ing the best we can with what
we have. 'The food will be pre-
pared by members of C.B.S.
and all funds raised from the
sale will be placed in the King
Scholarship Fund. it starts at

3. ”The Best Comedy Duo for

4. "Show Listened toMostby

however. John does not like

There you have it. The above
were chosen after careful
study and deliberation between
my egoandid. Hopefully, these
awards will convince you to
listen to KDIC, the voice of
the Grinnell Students. It's a
damn good station, and it’s
getting better. Stay tuned for
some innovating new ideas
from our new station mana-
ger, Clayton Lee. And now,
back to our regular scheduled
broadcast.

KDIC, the voice of the Grin-
nell students, is startinga new
service available for students
and faculty. A box marked
"KDIC Ride Board" will be
placed in the post-office. Any-
one who 1.) Needs a ride
2.) Is Offering a ride, or 3.)
Wants a hitching partner
should put all of the pertinent
information into the box. Once
during each show, the DJ will
read these “public service
announcements" and with a
little luck, you’ll get where
you’re going! Make sure you
include where you want to go,
what date, your name and
extension. Listen to Kch for
more details.
