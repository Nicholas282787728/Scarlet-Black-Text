tMeet John Pfitsch

View troml

by Dave Schechtcr
John Pfitsch is an anamoly
among college coaches. His suc-
cess is measured not by win~loss
records but in terms of the
relationships fostered with his
athletes. Fond of lecturing on his
particular philosophy, Pfitsch
recently stated, “What‘s important
is the growth in the individual . . .
the whole business is to help people
know themselves.”

Grinnell began its association
9with John Pfitsch in the tail of 1949.
Four years later he assumed duties
as athletic director and has
ingrained his style on me athletic
rogram. There is no sport at
Vgrinnell that Pfitsch has not
coached. Still, to know John
Pfitsch you must talk with him; or
rather, you must take the time to
listen. Pfitsch’s mother once said.
“When he was born he was in
noculated With a victrola needle."
And, as the caricature of him on his
office wall reads, ”1 never met a

person I didn’t talk to.”

Alfred Pfitsch was a missionary
doctor with me United Lutheran
Church in India when son John was
born in 1919. The senior Pfitsch
‘mparted his social conscience

on John, who has carried a
similar concern for those around
him all of his life. As a coach,
Plitsch’s primary concern is that

is athletes enjoy what he con-
rs to be the educational
process of athletics.

From star athlete at Pflugerr
ville High School (that’s right
lolks, another Pf pﬂyer), Plilseh
ventured to the University of
Texas. Then came his role as
assistant basketball coach to the
legendary Phog Allen at Kansas.
Where his father contributed a
value system. Allen gave Pfitsch
vast knowledge of coaching.

. .Coaching presents a unique
chotomy to Plitsch. “At the time
of the game, winning or losing is a
big thing. But what’s really im-
portant to me is the relationships
give had with those boys. It's good
‘ o see what has happened to them
and feel that I‘ve contributed.
That’s what the hell it’s all about,”
laughed Pfitsch.

Adorning the walls of his office
are pictures or past Grinnell
teams. With obvious affection
Pfitsch pointed to a picture of the
1962 championship basketball
team, believing this to have been
the best basketball team in
Grinnell’s history. However, the

shman football team of 1569i

ranks as his favorite. With only 13

three of their games ”and in terms
of pure enjoyment it was my
favorite . . .i’ve never had so much
luck at putting together a team in a
hurry,"

mits to feeling closer to students

the more personal aspects of
athletics rather than hard line
competition He commented, “My
particular philosophy is not
popular or practical . . . maybe
Grinnell has adopted my
philosophy over the years 'but not
bought it."

Ex-athletes write Pfitsch
regularly and you can meet them
by venturing into many Iowans'
offices. Being an athlete on a
Pfitsch-coached team is enjoyable.
His sense or humor. strange though
it be. makes any practice a
pleasure. Who else would have a
friend from Portugal come to
lecture the soccer team on the
recent revolution? Who else joins
his soccer team at the end of the
season in the Pub, and even gets up
to dance? And who else converted
a German World War II Shell
factory into a plant making 10,000
baseball bats?

His influence is what has made
athletic participation at Grinnell
the rewarding experience that it
has been ror myself and hundreds
of others. Of his most memorable
experience he tells a story. “When
I coached my first basketball game
up at Carleton , . I remember
thinking that Grinnell was some
kind of a different place, We went
to the locker room before the game
and I Couldn't find my captain. . .
Earl Pisner, thats who it
was. . . well anyway I found Pisner
in the john reading a book. So i ask
what in the hell is the matter with
this guy. And he just looked up and
said, ‘I’m studying ' That's WhenI
first thought about Grinnell in a
different light,”

Grinnell's athletic program is
Special in that it gives the in-
dividual the chance to learn while
competing, The athlete learns
about discipline, cooperation, and
the limits of one's ab ities while at
the same time enjoying the ex-
perience. Athletics at Grinnell
should be rewarding for the in»
dividual competitor, whether he or
she is the star or least talented oi
the team, and this is what's most
important. For his contribution to
this experience, John Pfitsch

 

deserves the thanks of many.

Batmen Win

by Don Petrich

The Grinnell Pioneers baseball
team went into action against
Graceland College last Monday.
The Pioneers won the first game, 6~
5, and lost the second, 8-5.

The ﬁrst game was highlighted
by the pitching of Grinnell’s Dave
Wick. Wick held Graceland to five
hits and five runs. Wick rifled the
ball for the full seven innings and
completed the game with seven
strikeouts.

Some of the key plays of the
game came from Grinnell's ol-
fensive attack. Doug sidel drove in
two runs with his first homer of the
year. Todd Kucera ripped a triple
which drove in a run before Dave
Dunning singled "Kuch" home. In
the filthinning, Bill Trautman hit a
single to drive in a run which gave
the Pioneels a 5-3 lead.
