5 Support Saga Structure

base oi the iood service is re-
stocking inventory. This tunction
claims iiesooo per year inreplace-
ment silverware. china, glassware,
pans, and salt and pepper shakers;
an 'amount equal to one per cent oi
Saga’s total income,

Ralph Romerenk, administrative
supervisor oi Food Service, com.
mented that ”a lot gets stolen,”
especially spoons, knives and gle
asses He feels that these iactors
“combine to inilate costs and stu—
dents should realize it.”

To cut down on breakage olchil'ta
due to dishwashers and employees,
Saga is replacing the china with
plastic dishes. Director or Food
Services Jerry Ramaker explain»
ed that the initial cost 0! the play
tlc is higher than chuia, but will
reduce the cost oibreakage,

Ramaker added that the inventory
uprkeep is part or Saga's contract
With the College. It Saga were to
leave tomorrow, part of their re»
sponsibility would be leaving the
inventory levels where they were
when Saga arrived 15 years ago,
Conversely, the College would have
to pay Saga ll stocked items were
highter than the original levels

Budgeting naturally includes the
payment oi Saga trom board costs,
which is handled by Pomerenk and
College Treasurer Robert Ander-
son. Fomerenk stated that Saga is
not given all oi the board money,
which is calculated to the cents
per day per student

Some oi the withheld board funds

are used ior dining room improve
ments such as the recent overhaul
0! Quad dining hall done over Ch-
ristmas break, he added

The present board tigure stands
at $2.40 per day per student, the
eluding the 5; per day per student
increase added this semester. This
iigure is then broken down per
meal. Approximately one-sixthgoes
to breakfast, two—sixths to lunch
and threersixths to dinner.

Budgeting labor is another major
pillar supporting the Saga pyramid.
They ensure that there are always
enough workers to handle menl ru—
shes, but never more than necer
ssary. Ramaker Clariﬁed the 56*
ience oi starting the [Drum and
dining balls to produce exactly the
right number of people at the right
time.

He explained that lunches are the
biggest problem to calculate, but
usually Monday, WednesdayandFrlr
day lunches are slow at ﬁrst and
require only one crew ot workers.
A second Crew is then added at»
ter the 11 o’clock classes let out.
The opposite problem happens at
the Tuesday, Thursday and Sat—
urday lunches. The double Crews
operate during the first hour and
case on to one crew tor the ram
aining oi the meal,

Rush hours at the grill include
breaktast, noon and alter concerts,
plays and movies, Ramakei- Com-
mented that the grill is rarely
empty, and that there is a tairly
steady flux of people the whole
day.

Learning these patterns has help-
ed to cut down on the chronic
operating losses the grill sntiers,
Ramaker noted. Other tactors have
been raising pricef and oiiering
new items.

Hiring student labor constitutes
another basic building block of the
campus toad service. Saga takes
Student workers who have a ”prir
ority one” rating from the student
aid otiice, a rating which guarane
tees students a campus job.

Ramaker said that the only ex—
ceptions were it Saga could not
get enough people to rill shirts.
He cited the noon meal as an ex-
ample, saying that class schedules
occasionally contlict with the peak
doublershllt periods and Cause it
labor shortage.

Scheduling meal hours are also
a headache- to the pyramid build-
ers as théy change the hours every
semester to satisiy unhappy stu-
dents. Ramaker said that the total
number of meal hours do not ch—
ange, but rather only the opening
and closing times,

The linal block which completes
the weighty pyramid's base is the
saga wage-earning rate, It was re»
ised last year after students succr
esslully petitioned the College for
a raise. The raise was granted on
the basis that dining hall workers
periorm under ”less desirable”
conditions.

Saga Workers now receive $1.80
per hour, instead or their previous
wage or $1,eo._
