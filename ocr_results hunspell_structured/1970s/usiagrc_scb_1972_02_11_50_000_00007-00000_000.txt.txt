Plan New Selection Process

To the consternation of many
students, the selection process for
next year’s student advisers is
undergoing transformation. A iew
words oi explanatory material may
clear up the situation for those who
are indecisive as to the benetits and/
or detriments of the new system.

with intentions to alleviate the dif-
iiculty in selecting qualified student
advisers, aspects oflast year’s pro—
cess are being changed. ”This
year’s SA. selection is a direct
result oi last year’s,” Marjory

Daly explained to the 55:3. Insti»
tuting a system whereby the major
ity of evaluations occur within two
weeks after the reception oi applir
cations will hopefully produce better
results than last year's r ‘ocess of
several Weeks.

Three divisions comprise the
selection process. “There have been
provisions made in the program to
consider how the individual works
within a group. This is important
because interaction between the S.A.
and others on the floor in the beginv
ning are a iorm of group interac-
tion. There will be references either
from a resident adviser, a faculty
member or a member of the coun-
seling staff and from the student ad-
visers, house presidents, vice pres-
idents and house coordinators as a
group. The purpose of this was that

from

FRIEND page,”

Attorney General Tom Clark. “This
was during the Truman administra»
tion," he says, “so I was kind of a
Republican in the Democratic
camp.” Two and one-half years
later he went to Louisiana to study
civil law, and since hewas an Eisen»
hower and Nixon supporter in the
midst of Democrats, “I found my
self sort of the campus Republican
representative!”

Vanderpool had no contact with Nix-
on while he was Vice—President, but
did see him a couple of times sev-
eralwyears latgr during_the ’60’5
when'Nixomwas‘active‘iﬁund-rais
ing campaigns for the Republican
party. As the local county chairman
of the Republican party in 196a, he
heard Nixon speak in Des Moines
in the Fall of that year. "His speech
was about/the usual things,probably
unity in the Republican party," he
said, ”and I did get to meet him
afterwards and discuss mutual
friends.“

Remember Carsweli?

Another interesting sidelight of

Vanderpool’s undergraduate years
at Duke Was his association with
'another one-time public iigure, G.
Harold Carswell, Carswell, who was
nominated by Nixon for the U. S.
Supreme Court in 1970 but rejected
by the Senate, was at that time the
rush chairman of a, socialiraternity
at Duke.

"After he graduated,” Vanderpool
remembers, “he wentto Florida and
organized a ‘Democrats for Eisenr
bower' group.” His political leans
ings probably helped him get the
appointment and, Vanderpool notes,
“he probably has a kind of Nixon
story oi his own.“

Regarding Nixon, Vanderpool says
“I felt I knew him asaperson somee
What...l ielt he was very thoughtful
and reilective when answering ques-
tions. and he was very courteous."
But Vanderpool is quick to disclaim
any close personal ties. “i don’t
even know if he would remember my
name. My relationship with him was
a long time ago, in a group.”
Vanderpool’s only contact With
Nixon anymore, he emphasizes, is
probably just a hangover irom his
days as county chairman “I get a
Christmas card from him every
year.”

ment officers accepted this respon-
sibility and agreed to have the re»
ierences back by Feb, 14,” said
Mrs. Daly.

The deans’ selection process would
involve having a group of applicants
discuss a possible problem while six
observors Watched from behind a
thWay mirror.

In the light of the conﬂict concern-
ing this method, Mrs. Daly replied
to the SALE that it in fact would not
make the selection impersonal, but
would permit the group to be uni
disturbed. With certain qualifica-
tions in mind the evaluators would
observe and listen as the group
determines the action needed in the
proposed situation. Twenty minutes
are allotted for this portion of the
evaluation, cutting down the process
from several weeks to five days.

Another innovation will occur in the
area of housing the new student
advisers. Previously S.A,’s listed
three preferences as to where they
preferred to live. But since most
preferred the same three, few were

E. Complex

Several cases of theft have been reported at Grinnell’s Physical Education
complex. The majority of thens have occurred in the evenings, particularly
on Friday and Saturday. Wallets, watches and various other articles lett
in unlocked lockers and on benches have been stolen. Almost all thefts
reported occurred in the men‘s locker room. There appears to be only
vague suspicion as to the identity oi the culprits.

Several people who work at the complex Commented to the son on the
stealing. One noted that the same problem existed at Darby. People leit
their locker unlocked and found articles missing when they returned,
One astute inan summed it up this way, “If you don't lock it up, it’ll be

gone.”

Suspense Film Effective

by Robert Simmons

The director of Klute, Alan J.
Pakula, has not watched enough
Hitchcock to know that if you reveal
the “whodunit” in a suspense film
you must still have a device for
building tension. If you build too
much tension too long before the
climax without a device for re
lieving it, however, you will lose the
audience in frustration. But perhaps,
despite its advertising campaign,
Klute may not be primarily a sus
pense film. It is more honestly a
suspenseful psychological study oi
several people in a strange situation.
In that, Pakula has succeeded most
ably.

The Sterile Cuckoo of several years
back will be a familiar reminder of
some of Pakula’s past work There
are probably only a iew people that
remember him. “Barbarella” is
a reminder of the Jane Fonda of a
few years back. Mostpeopie rememr
her all of her. M‘A‘S‘H is the
Donald Sutherland oi only a iew years
ago. In this film people may Want to
forget him. What I mean to say is
Klute’s direction is medlocre,Sutnr
erland’s acting is not up to par, but
Jane Fonda’s periormance may be
the best one by an actress last year,

Sutherland portrays a smallrtown
cop turned gumshoe who goes to the
big city to find a missing iriend. One

of his main leads is Bree Daniels,
an expensive call-girl/model(Fon-
da), who is trying to quit prostitu»
tioii, Meanwhile, lots oi spooky
things are happening to her. She and
the cop meet and develop the relae
tionship that is most of the film.

The characterization of the high
Class Whore who is in it only forthe
power over men it gives her, works
for the audience on all levels. Her
abilities and deficiencies in relating
to people and situations provide a
character that is facinating. Fonda’s
performance is impressive in its
understanding, completeness, and
subtlety, The cop seems to be writ
ten as a dolt who is honest and per-
sistant, but not too bright. The role
seems to be constantly constricting
for Sutherland,

Please forgive the script for these
and other mistakes. Also forgive the
director ior using ”specialeffects"
as ii they were a new Christmas toy.
