The position of Dean oi the
Curriculum is a new one, both to
Eysenbach and the college. She
defines it as “a focal point for
discussion of all matters related
curricula development,"
Eysenbach is very open to the
possibility that ”ideas ior imr
provement can come from
anywhere,” and she eagerly
welcomes both administrative and
student contact.

innovations

One speciiic curriculum in-
novation which Eysenbach ans
ticipates is the introduction of a
program oi women’s studies at
Grinnell, posSlbly in the form of an
independent major. She prefers not
to speculate upon other con-
ceivable new programs at this
point.

As she perceives them,
Eysenbach's duties as Dean will
include approval oi independent
majors and projects, direct in»
volvement with the off-campus
study board, the academic stan-
ding committee, 372 programs, the
curriculum committee, and in
terdisciplinary programs.

She will also be indirectly in-
volved with all freshman-year
related programs and committees,
through cooperation with Charles
Davis and Ray Obermiller, In
addition, Ms, Eysenbach will be
teaching a course in economics
second semester.

Eysenbach foresees no serious
problems, either as a dean or a
woman. On the contrary, it is her
opinion that status as the first
iemale dean will be advantageous,
in the sense that she will be able to
contribute a new perspective and
set oi experiences to the college
community.

Examine Rush program

byEllenWright

A new academic venture was
launched at Grinncll this
semester—the Grinnell~Rush
Medical Studies (GEMS) program.
This innovative set-up enables
students qualified for admission to
Rush Medical College to spend
their first year of medical study at
a small, iiberal~arts institution.
After completing medical training
at Rush, they are awarded the
MD, degree.

Ten students are participating in
the program this semester, The
three from GrinnelliPam
charney, Renee Garrick, and
Bonnie Neyhart, each entered the
program after three years of line
dergraduate study.

They will be eligible to receive
the B A at the end of their GEMS
year at Grinnell, and Will have
trimmed one year from their total
college preparation

PrefcrsGrinnc-ll

Though Bonnie as a premed
could have .applied in her junior
year to other medical schools, she
saw in the Grinnelerush program
a transition between unr
dergraduate study and medical
school. Though the courses are
comparable to those in a first-year
medical school curriculum, the
atmosphere is different.

“I don't like cities," Bonnie
claims. “My idea is to work as a
doctor in a small town,"

Others citied the clinical tutorial,
in which students assist local
physicians in interviewing and
examining patients, as a favorably
difference. Another factor is the
teaching staff of trained professors
selentists.

Five Grinnell professors are
participating: program director
Irving y, Fishman (biology). J.
Philip Bays (chemistry), John R.
Denbo (biology), Irene M, Jones
tbiologyi, and John J. Martinek
(biology), They teach a specially-
designed unit of courses for the
medical students,

Othel'Pnrticipallts
The small size of the classes in
the unit, and the personal at
tention, interest some oi the
participants who graduated irom
colleges other than Grinnell, They
also like the opportunity to study
family-mediclen practices
Many of these students have
majored in the humanities or
social sciences, and are taking
advantage of Rush‘s special in-
terest m liberalrarts students.

Dr. William F. Hejna, dean of
Rush Medical college and a 1954
graduate of Grinnell, said that the
educational philosophy at Rush ii
aimed to produce “a new
generation of physicians
thoroughly trained and in-
tellectually prepared to offer new
ideals of Service . . . Sound liberals
arts studies are highly important
to the process of training health
care specialists for this com-
prehensive and concerned
outlook.”

History or Program

Grinnell College became in
terested in affiliating with the
Rush~Presbyterian»St. Luke’s
Medical Center in Chicago because
of its excellent staff, the fact that '
each member is a practicing
physician, and its clinical orien
tation. As Fishman noted, ”Their
main principle is the provision of
health service to the Chicago
area.” >

A Grinnell College committee
was formed last year to study and
develop the program._ The grow.
reviewed the records of the Grin
nell applicants and sent the
students to visit the facility.

Fishman commented, “There
wasn‘t anyone who applied who
wasn’t enthusiastic about what
they saw.” The Grinnellians were
impressed with the interest shown
in them as people.

Courses

The iirst-year curriculum at
Grinnell consists of 25 credits the
first semester. and 22 the second.
The unit includes courses in human ’
anatomy, genetics, human
physiology, biochemistry, human
nutrition, cell physiology,
microbiology, pharmacology,
behavioral sciences, and histology
pathology.

Some oi the classes are open to
Grinnell undergraduates who have
permission oi the instructor, as
space permits. Some of the
Grinnell-Rush students with
previous preparation have been
exempted irom one or more oi th
courses, and are enrolled in
generaleurriculum Grlnnell
courses.

Housing

The ten GRMS students live in
two offrcampus houses leased by
the college for that purpose. The
atmosphere is quiet, because oi the
hard study, but also cooperative.
The students feel that living and
working together will help reduce
competition.
