of the season this afternoon at Mt.

‘ For the first time in recent years,

coach Ray Obermiller will have a

team he thinks may prove to be his
best ever at Grinnell.

The 1977 team is made up of nine
returnees. five of whom are let-

and eight freshmen. The Pioneers’
five returning lettermen from last
year‘s team, which finished fifth in

who hadn’t coached volleyball
before last year, iondly reminisces
3‘ about his '76 squad and its
astonishing accomplishments.
This year, however, Latimer ens
» counters many problems, the most
. important being the loss of six
starters from the ’75 squad.
Latimer's loss of players oc-
curred not because of graduation,
personality conﬂict or any normal
' causes, instead most of his losses
came from ioreign studies and off-
‘ campus programs. ThBe causes.
' alien to most college campuses,
occur frequently at Grinnell and
thus must be accepted by the
athletic coaches.
With only three of his starting
nine players returning, Latimer
could only look up on the team’s

. fashion, Most ol his optimism
i centers around the return of last
year’s MVP Marnie Curran and

women.

Curran, according to Latimer,
“is one of the finer players In the
state.” Her superior allraround
skills combined with the spiking
skills of returning letterwomen
Ann Chasen and Kim Brydnn will
give the Pioneers a solid offensive
attack, Latimer‘s greatest worry is
the loss oi all his varsity ”setters,"

This year, Alison Goodman,
Susan Edmonds, Julie Bowers,
Mercedes Jones, Rosemary
Strunk, and Leslie Workman will
replace last year’s setters. Each
one of these women will be
beneficial to this year’s “defensive
strategy.”

Youth is a dominant trait of this
year's volleyball team since there
are no seniors and only one junior
competing. This fact means
anything might happen in the
team‘s future. Latimer, who
honestly admitted to not holding
any real answers about the team‘s
future, summarizes everyone’s
thoughts by saying, “We have
some good players and i hope we
mesh well as a team."

The Grinnell women‘s cross
country team will begin its 1977
season with a dual meet against
Cornell at Mt. Vernon today. This
year's squad, consisting of 13
members, is one of the largest
Grinnell has ever ﬁelded. With
only three girls returning irom last
year, Chris Stidley (78), Anne
Nassilf (30), and Pat Muller (80),
the bulk oi the team is made up of
freshmen: Laurie Ballou. Jayne
Batten, Sara Birchford, Toni
Heiman, Yaia Napadensky, Ruth
Raiche. Other newcomers are
Julia Carver (30). Cindy Griffith
we), Renae Reese (on), and Anne
Six (80).

Rookie coach Kit Wall looks
forward to a successful season
because of the startling high
turnout oi the freshmen class, She
believes that their potential equals
or surpasses that of earlier freshr
men classes. With this year’s
talented youth, Wall believes that
Grinnell has established a solid
base to build on in the future.

Women’s physical education
coach Anna Wack believes that this
year’s tennis team is just as strong
as last year‘s.

“We lost our top three players
from last year,” Wack said
"but we have new people who look
like they might be good." No ol
those players from last year were
lost to graduation, The other is
studying off-campus.

Sixteen players are competing to
earn one of the top six rankings.
These six players will challenge
Coe on Friday, September 16.

Among those vying for positions
are returning players Nancy
Fernandez, Amy Frieden, Mary
Hartnett, Jeannette Mulcahy and
Sarah Tecson. Senior Marca Fox
has returned to competition after
taking last year off.

Others competing for play are
upperclassmen who were unable to
participate on last ymr's team.
These include Sheila Adenwalla,
Paula Banchy, Trish Fitzgibbon
Beth Gwynn and Margot Schindler.

Freshmen hopeluls are Susan
Despain, Karin Ford, Ellen Levin,
Susan Maxwell and Louanne
Shearer,

These women will be playing one
match daily against one another
through next Monday. By then the
top six will be determined.

Coach Wack said the team
should be comparable to last
year‘s “if these people continue to
play the way they are playing
now.”
