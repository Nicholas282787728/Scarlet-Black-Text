shbarger. This will be Harshbarger's ﬁrst major production

describes it as ". . one of the most powerful plays I’ve ever
been associated ."

Strindberg wrote three very different types of plays—
historical, dream, and realistic, of which last sort Miss Julie
is probably the best example. Why’.’ Because of the ex
tremely complex motivations of the characters and the
subtlety with which they are exposed. Set in a Swedish
country estate in the 1880’s on Midsummer Night’s Eve, it
deals not only with the antagonism between the upper and
lower classes, but also the antagonism between the sexes,
The young Miss Julie is played by Barbara Tholfsen, her

Joanna Churgin.

Ashbrook

Marshall

Susan J. Ashbrook, a senior
classics major, from Rochester,
N.Y., was awarded a Marshall
Scholarship this week for two
years of graduate study in Great
Britain, A select number of
Americans were awarded these
scholarships this week.

Ashbrook plans to obtain
her Master’s or maybe her Ph. D.
in comparative ancient and
modern Greek poetry at the
University of Birmingham. She
called the program very tough in
comparison to American stan-
dards. but Ashbrook likes the
English tutorial format of the
curriculum which allows more
academic freedom. Furthermore,
Birmingham is one of the few
universities in the world with a
program which allows such
comparative studies,

Study in Greece 'last year
stimulated Ashbrook’s interest ill
the continuity of the poetry of
Greece from antiquity to the
present. Despite differences in the
language and society, she claims.
the work of Greek poets represents
a Continuum, not a series 01
separate categories unrelated to
one another, She hopes to return to
Greece while studying at Bil-r
mingliam

The British Government gives
these grants each ycar in honor of
General George . ‘Iarshall who,
as US Secretary of State shortly
after World War ll, proposed the
European Recovery Program or
Marshall Plan, The scholarships
were established in 1953 m
gratitude to the us for economic
assistance. Thirty outstanding
students Irom Alncl'lcan colleges
and universities receive the
awards annually.

The criterion for selection by the
Marshall Aid Commemoration
Commission is “distinction of ill-
tellect and character as evidenced
both by scholastic attainments and
by other activities and
achievements.”

A perfect 4.0 student in classics,
Ashbrook maintains a 3.6 overall
grade point, Under the Marshall
programs adviser, Prof. Don A.
Smith, Ashbrook applied for the
grant in the fall.

Jobs
short
on order

Students may have to open
themselves to the possibility of
dishwashing, short order cooking,
and hamburger sales counter work
this summer in order to join the
ranks of the employed [or three
months, Career Service Director
John Adams advises.

Construction employment is the
one area cited as heavily affected
by the present state of the economy
causing fewer summer openings.
One of the higher paying labor
jobs, construction could loosen by
June with the decline in mortgage
rates, Adams added,

Summer camps or seasonal
places appear to be likely targets
for summer job hunters, according
to Adams, because these areas
traditionally hire college students
and full time employees presently
unemployed would be less likely to
take these jobs. Resort areas
though will be crowded with such
unemployed full time employees
who are holding themselves over
until a full time position becomes
available.

Grinncll appears to be less
fruitful this year due to lay oils and
strikes for summer employment.
Last year a large number of
students remained in Grinnell to
work, quite a few employed in
various construction projects in
the vicinity. Adams recommends
that students interested in working
in Grinnell “start talking to people
ln town ”

‘A student should decrde what he
would like to do, what he ls Willing
to do, prepare a resume, and
persistently check on the ape
plication and resume, Adams
instructed A resume, even for a
sales or clerical job. is necessary
Adams thinks, because it is casler
to communicate \vlth the lil-
terviewer and interviewee.

The most effective way to obtain
a job is through contacts whether
they are people on busses or planes
traveling home, friends, or
families. Adams stated Forllim.
as a gcnci-al rule, the person nho is
lllclhodlcal and Serious in the
approach to finding employment
will find a job. He added, though. it
may take a week or two longcr v.lth
the state of the cconomy

The economy, Adams believes,
may require people to he more
flexible in what sort of jobs they
take "An Incredible number” of
people have becn using the sum-
mer Job listings and \ ‘ ’
resumes m the Career 591‘
Office this year, but Adams is not
sure whether the increased usage
is more attributable to the oilicc or
the economy.

It the student hasn’t started
looklng for a job, Adams advises to
do so immediately at spring break,
especially if a Job is sought in the
home area. Adams sees very little
disadvantage in finding jobs for the
student away from home, like most
Grinnellians, as long as their
approach is not ”haphazard” now

the student goes about seeking a
job is more important, to Adams
mind, than the geographical
location.

The motive behind a summer job
is a vital consideration according
to Adams who says that motivation
can make a difference in where the
student looks. Particularly if a
student desires a job mainly ft?
experience or travel, the option 0
volunteer work should be con-
sidered. Many churches, coma
munity organizations, political
officeS, and businesses might otter
room, board, and-or a little
spending money for a volunteer. lf
money is the primary objective,
Adams warns the student living
away from home to figure if his
pay will cover living expenses and
still provide savings.

Don Brandt, assistant direct!)
Career Services, who has beerr
primarily in charge of the summer
iob program of Career Services,
held a summer job workshop
before Christmas for about 20
Students. An overview of
traditional and nontraditional
summer opportunities was
presented. After Christmas,
several students have been aided
in their summer search by the
office with a few reporting success
