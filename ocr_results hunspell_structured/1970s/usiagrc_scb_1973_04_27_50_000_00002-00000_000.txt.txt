‘Clark’s Walk Is A
learning Experience’

- by John Wylie

United States Senator Dick Clark staged his first
wa‘lk Monday and Tuesday since his November upset
Of Republican Jack Miller.

Clark began his walk at a truck stop near Brook»
lyn, ten miles east oi Grinnell, and wound it up about
iiiteen miles west oi Grinnell, near Kellogg. He spent
about four hours Tuesday morning in Grinnell,

Clark said that he was walking now not only to keep
a campaign promise but also because “walking is
the only eitective way oi iinding out what the people
feel; what they are concerned about",

Clark began his walk early Monday morning at a
cafe and service station just north of Brooklyn
Several Grinnell students were on hand as the Senar
tor began his walk, iollowed by a small corps oi
reporters, cameraman, and photographers.

Gasoline Crisis

Clark, noting that the primary purpose oi this walk
was to gain a perspective on rural problems, talked
first about the gasoline and fuel oil crisis now facing
lowa.

“We’re going to have an enormous gasoline and luel
oil crisis on our hands for the forseeable future
because we’re raising our consumption so much
taster than we can conceivably get the crude oil out
of the ground -- Or that it even exists in the ground”

Clark called for further study of the Implementation
of the Canadian pipeline to bring desparately needed
oil'to the Midwest as a short term solution.

As a long term solution, he called for federal eXr
penditures on research and development programs
for alternate energy sources which meet environmental
standards,

‘ He also called for a national inventory of energy
resources and needs, A reduction or American energy
consumption is a necessity, he noted, since the United
states, “with its relatively small population, is pre-
sently using over 40% oi the world’s energy supply”.

Responding to questions irom two Grinnell students,
Clark Said that the US. should exercise care not to
get involved in another Southeast Asian war.

“1 think if the nonecommunist peoples of these
areas ieel strongly in terms oi maintaining that kind
of a nonecommunist government, they‘re goingto have
to use their own energies and do it themselves."

Clark also expressed fears that the current US.
bombing raids could lead to renewed American involv
vement, noting that, “we’re going to go back in,

e're..poing to use the Beszls, wetre going to lose
more- prisoners ee you just can’t go on with the
'bombing without that."

Clark said he sensed a growing unity in the Congress
against any further U,S, involvement. He also noted
that any proposal for aid to Hanoi would meet with
his disapproval, at least for the present.

”How can we rebuild them one day, and then bomb
them out again the next. And the President made the
implied threat or renewed bombing only two weeks
ago.”

Many farmers who stopped Clark along U.S. Highway
6 as he walked towards Grinnell expressed concern
for the future of the family farm. But none indicated
that they planned to give up the rural life in layer oi
an a to 5 city job.

And Clark expressed a degree oi optimism about
farmers. He told one farm wife that he sensed
a degree or unity among the nation’s major iarm
organizations that was “the best I’ve seen in my
lifetime". And in this unity, he added, there could
be the strength needed to get a better, iairer iarm
program.

Clark spent the entire day Monday on the highway,
waving to passing motorists and chatting with those
who stopped At noon, he detoured to Mfilcom for
lunch, then continued on the road until last after-
noon, when he stopped at the Eugene Lang iarm just
sputh and east of Grinnell,

Clark visited the campus Monday evening to hear
columnist Donald kaul lecture. However, few people
in the crowded South Lounge realized who he was,
and he came and left almost unnotlcied.

Tuesday

Clark walked into Grinnell early Tuesday morn-
ing, greeted by only a few students and an even
larger contingent of reporters than was on hand
Monday,

The senator toured Saint Paul’s Episcopal Church,
on the south edge oi the Campus, and spoke to the

A $35,000 grant has been awarded to Grinnell by the National Science
Foundation to help finance the first comprehensive taxonomic analysis
of Collembola found in North America north of the Rio Grande River.

The grant, announced Wednesday by President Glenn Leggett, will
support work to be conducted by Kenneth A. Christiansen and Peter F,
Bellinger from May 1, 1973, through Oct. 31, 1975. Christiansen is Norris
Professor oi Biology here and Bellinger is Professor oi Biology at Calie

Senator Dick Clark (Center left) talked with several
Grinnell students as well as townspeople and loci-ll
iarmers who dropped by as he strolled along highway
is last Monday and Tuesday,

church‘s rector, Father Michael TanCreti about the
impact of administration funds impoundments on social
and environmental action programs in Grinnell and
Marshalltown.

As he walked through Grinnell alter meeting Tanv
Creti, Clark discussed the relationship between Con»
gress and the Executive Branch with reporters.

“The idea that this country can stand still fora
year and a hall on every phase of the urban and
rural programs is ridiculous." ltet, he continued,
this was the effect of the President’s actions im—
pounding funds. '

Nixon has succeeded in deiying Congress to date
because he had public support, Clark noted. But the
public seems to be becoming more aware of Water
gate » and less confident of the President.

“If the public loses confidence in the President
over Watergate, the Constitutional crisis is going to
be reversed mighty fast."

Clark added that a spirit of cooperation between the
branches of the, government is needed for effective
government, and that this spirit is presently lacking.
Clark continued into downtown Grinnell, where he
visitddﬁunumbera‘bf.businesses. He stopped in at the
College Office Building, and shook hands with most
of the employees and administrators there.

Clark then spent an hour over coffee at the Long
horn discussing iarm problems with Ralph stecher,
a retired farmer from Marshalltown and several
newsmen. Stecher produced copies of the Livestock
Reporter from February of 1951 showing cattle
prices were as high at that time as they are now.
Clark showed great interest in the figures, and proe
mised Stecher that the material would be printed
in the Congressional Record after Clark returned to
Washington,

After another farmer, Jack Sutherland 0f Gillman,
told Clark that today, the small American farmers
are “peasants" and that ”we've got a king right now
in Washington”, Clark remarked that he “had never
seen the farmers as upset as they are now”.

Clark predicted that, if the currentilighfeederprices
and uncertainty over possible price rollbacks are not
ended, farmers may curtail beef production, which
would raise meat prices even higher.

After four hours in Grinnell. Clark continued West
on the Highway, stopping for lunch at the rural home
of Dr. B. G. Wilttztng. After lunch, Clark continued
his walk, stopping at a road construction project
to try his hand at applyingaroadpatch to a chuokhole.
After a iarmer mentioned the grain shipping problem,
Clark turned his attention to the nation's railroads.
The problem is a severe one, he said, since almost
all the Northeastern lines are near bankruptcy.
Yet, he said that when he approached Agriculture
Secretary Earl Butz about the problem, Eutz had no
programs or even proposals to oiier.

Clark finished his walk about two miles short of his
goal v- the interchange with Iowa 224 southof Kellogg.
He seemed well satisfied with his two day "learning
experience”, and added that he plannedto walk “when—
ever I have the chance" during the next five years.

Collembola (small insect-like ani—
mals) are the second most abundant
group of soil arthropods in the world.
They are found throughout the world
and can number up to three trille
ion in an acre of soil,

Projected end result of the study
is a book, which hopefully will be
published in 1876. Christiansen enr
visions it as a text which will en»
able a non-specialist toidentiiy most
of the Collembola he deals with.

The text is expected to encompass
65770 genera and 050450 species of
Collembola. Included will be between
150 and 200 new species uncovered
by the Bellinger-Christiansen reg
search.

The two biologists foresee the ev-
ential discovery of many additional
species of Collemboia in North Am-
erica, As a result, they are devel-
oping a system of classification whe
ich will both facilitate ready identi-
fication of new taxa and will permit
their later inclusion into the exist-
ing system.

The only present taxonomic Works
on the Collembola of North America
are limited to single states and are
so outdated as to be of Very limited

use, according to Dr. Christiansen,

Early work conducted by Christian-
seu and Bellinger on the project
was funded by an institutional grant
made to Grinnell by the Sloan Foune
dation, In addition to accelerating
the pace oi the survey, the National
Science Foundation stipend will pro-
vide expanded opportunities ior stue
dent involvement in the work during
the next two years.

mer of 1973 will be Ann Baker

Four Students will assist with the
project during the 1973-74academic
year, three during the summer or
1974, and five during the 1974—75
academic year,

This is the sixth National Science
Foundation grant allocated to Pro—
fessor Christiansen, who has been
specializing in the study of Collem—
bola for more than 20 years. Hehas
done field work in the United States,
Canada, Europe, and the Middle

, Team TeachingOflers Variety

by kyle Schaub

We’re not offering a new Human-
ities course, but rather one that is
truly team taught,” clarified Assis-
tant Professor of English Peter Cone
nelly when asked about the four new
B-credit courses which he organized
and will help teach for the Spring
of 197A

Grinnell recently received a grant
to fund the ,new program, as repore
ted in the Ski} several weeks ago.

The “teams” are divided into the
literary 18th and 19th centuries,
with four professors handling each
century. Professors Beryl Clotfelte
er, Peter Connelly, Richard Howe
and Don Smith will share the respon-
sibility ior teaching the two proposed
courses for the 18th century sec-
tion: “Enlightenment" and “Age of
Scientific Revolution.“ Their com—
bined talents will encourage students
to consider the lath century interms
oi Science, English, Music and His-
tory.

The 19th century staff has not yet
decided uponits tentative course
titles, but the faculty includes Pro—
fessors James Kissane, Ronald kure
tz, Morris Parslow andJoseph Wall.
Their job will he to establish lines
oi thought between English, Anthro-
pology, French and History.

In selecting these instructors for
his project, Connelly notes that
"These professors have all been
here a long time and are experien»
ced." He also emphasizes that they
have the ability to work with one
another, an essential for teametau-
ght work.

Students will receive instruction
irom all low professors in their
course, with the choice of profess-
ors depending on the century. The
professors themselves will not tra-
vel in pairs or necessarily switch
at midsemester. Hence the students
will receive instruction ‘from four

different team combinations. Howe
ever, the students involved in one
particular course will have no for
mal connection with theother course
in the same century as well as none
with the other two courses in the
alternate century grouping.

Prerequisites in English and His-
tory will be required, thus eliecL
tively putting the secredit courses
on an upper level, with some sem-
inarrtype work to be expected.

The $78,500 grant through which
the program will be funded will be
used to pay the eight faculty mem»
bers who in effect will be taking
their own courses this summer,
in preparation for the courses next
Spring. The four faculty members
in each period will teach each other
the details of their respective eras
to form the integration of their dis»
ciplines in the true liberal arts
tradition.

Connelly warns, however, that the
complete course descriptions would
not be available until registration
for Spring 1974.
