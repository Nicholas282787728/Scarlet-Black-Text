are achieved through the use of
cross hatched lines. The styles
range from Beth Greellblatt‘s

“Still Life No. 1." Beth’s approach
is abstract, while Katie has

When the author of detective
stories, played by Sir Laurence
Olivier, discovers that his Wife is
having an affair with her hair-
dresser lMichael Came), he
devises an incredibly complex and
twisted plot to expose and
humiliate the lover. The' hair-
dresser. not to be outdone. devises
his own plot and so the movie goes
It’s a fascinating Sort of detective
story containing endless plots
within plots, and games within
games as the two men attempt to
outdo each other.

Laurence Olivier and Michael
Caine team up to give marvelous
performances in this story of in-
trigues and revenge. The director,
Joseph L. Mankiewlcz, succeeds
admirably in his adaption of the
Broadway play Sleuth. With very
low actors» and a very limited
numberofsels,he is able to give us
a dynamic. captivating. and totally
surprising lilm.

“Lolita. Light of my life. tire of
my lolns.” (Humbert Humbert in
Nabokov’s Lolita.) Here is another
fine film adaptation. this time done
by stanley Kubrick from the novel
by Vladimir Nabokov. Now, before
you start saying that the novel has
to be better, and how they probably
ruined it in the film. you should
know that Nabokov himself did the
rewrites for the screenplay or

Lolita, and furthermore that he
was very pleased with the way that
the film turned out. This sort of
thing doesn‘t happen very often in
films, and Lolita is worth seeing if
only for this reason.

Lolita is’ the story‘of Humbert
Humbert 'and his desire for the
adolescent girl Lolita. The story is
blackly humorous and quite
Satirical in its characterizations of
middle America. and middle
American types, and Kubrick
brings this humor to the screen
with impact. Like his film Dr.
Struiigelove Kubrick has done a
wondertul job of casting his movie.
James Mason plays the possessed
pedophile Humbert, and Sue Lyons
the “nymphet” Lolita. Shelly
winters is cast in the part of
Lollta's mother Delores Haze, and
Peter Sellers plays the ever-

elusive. enigmatic Claire Quilty.
As in Kubrick's other lllms, the
camerawork, the scenery, and the
script in Lolita combine to create a
strong uniiied effect on the
audience. Kubrick is at his elegant
best in scenes such as the one in
which Delores. Humbert, and
Lolita take a [rip to the driverin
movie. Not a word is spoken, but
everything is immediately clear.
