Shelley

Wanders,
Recalls Her
Four Years

by Shelley Floyd

Several weeks ago the editors of the 5&8
asked me to Write an article for their
special commencement issue and suggested
that my topic be something related to SGA.
This seemed fine at the time; l had a few
ideas about such flrey issues as the new
role of interest and splinter groups in stu-
dent life, the history of student involvement
in Campus concerns for the semester and a
halt preceeding this onerran idea that died
for lack of enough material to filla column,
and a comparison of SGA’s political and
administrative functions. But the more I
conjectured about what students, especially
seniors, would be interested in reading at
Commencement time, the more I felt that
SGA was not it In moments of sweet
nostalgia and antsy pants---studentgovern-
merit? Why should people change their ati-
tudes at this stage or the game7

But that left me with either finding another
topic or iagging an article on SGA Unfor-
tunately, these thoughts didn’t Come until
pretty laten—early last Wednesday morning
as I was finishing what l hoped would be
the last of my college a11»nighters, to the
background of “Roll over Beethoven" on the
radio, Marshall Barber was finishing an
all-night radio show, the last one at Grinnell.
There's certainly ample material for an ar-
ticle on that figure, Marshall lived in the
hall next to mine my freshman year. Haines
and James were zlvant-ghrde for those
times, for they were one of two pairs of
dorms on campus in which men and women
nails were right next to each other. The
people in the two halls thrived on this
libertine experiment; comaradie was high
and spirited. The president of l-laines, Chris
Meyer, with his football physique and curly
blonde hair, seemed to us freshmen to be
the ultimate ideal in EMOCracy. At any
rate, Marshall had only been at school a
week, when he’d made a name for himself
in this subculture. Known to everyone as
"Prep Barber” -this was beiore the days
of RM Beer— he was already a legend
in his own time,

But enough of this dillyedallylng, If i
intended to find something to write about,
I’d have to act last and get some advice
from others. After all, finals time was ape
preaching and people would be busying
studying, Thinking the SGA files might have
some suggestions, I headed towards the

‘Tho Scarlet and Black

Fortlnl. Walking across campus, i passed
through scores oi people out on the lawn
listening to Kim Thomas and tllt: Up and
Coming. ves, finals time was rough i
remembered independent 398 with Kim and
years were in the drawer next to it
WaWa and their jam sessions on Barber
plaza But on to the tiles Mr Pomei'enk‘s
memorandunls ior this year were in one file
drawer, Most of the other stuff tor our four
years were in the drawer next to it
There wasn't much tor an article to suit
me, but there were some interesting items:

-—-zi two-inch file at letters and memos
from the President concerning the change
irom the old ling pole to the two east at
Herrick and the problems U.N nag etiquette
presented for flying the U.S. liag at halle
mast

This was all very interesting, but time was
running out it occurred to me that my
intellectual mentors in the history depart-
ment might have some helpful wisdom.
Climbing the four flights of stairs train the
Post Office to Carnegie 3rd i thought ot
Milton's line, “Long is the way, and hard,
from hell unto the light",‘ Mr. kintnerwas
busy talking to students, so lwent next
door to Mr. Guroii The view from Mr
Guroff’s ottice is great; irom where hesils
you can look down on nearly the entire
campus. When i told him the ti-oublei was
having in finding something to write about,
he replied, “It seems, Shelley. that you’re
asking the wrong questions. You know, the
questions you ask determine the kinds of
answers you get. Yes, you’re a victim oi
your agenda, work on that”

Feeling wiser but still topicless, i went
over to Mr. Schlereth's office, but he was
busy conducting an inquiry with another
student and unable to “chat” with me Mr.
Jordan was in, however. He analyzed my
problem as being one of starting on too big
a scale and suggested tllat i start on a
smaller sample, like a dormitory, and then
lrom these smaller studies piece together
a larger picture at the campus. He liked
the way i was doing oral interviews to
get information and suggested 1 put a copy
ot my article in his file oi Grinncll docile
merits and chronicles in the libra- Next
door, Mr. Jones was too busy writing his
article tor this stein issue to talk. Besides,
he was speaking at a dinner tor Magee
that night at which he was going to use
an overhead projector, and he needed to
save a couple of hours to learn how to
operate it, Mr. Smith was busy too, asking
a colleague in the iaculty something about
whether justice had been served.

The laculty was meeting that alteruoon
Maybe i could get some help there. Iran
into Mike stern on the way over, but More
1 could get the words out oi my mouth to
ask him for help, he had n microphone out
and was asking inc what i thought of the
recent marches in town against the war.
In the hall outside the meeting i could hear
Mr, liottois giggling, inside, the meeting
was like always Someone trom the Math

department was saying that the Math (le-
partment was a special case in the issue
being discussed. Mr. Magee was, as usual,
in the corner on the front row buried in
his tweedaymld New York Times. As I
proceeded over to join him i almost slipped
on something, It turned out to be the shells
[rpm the peanuts Mr throff was eating.
Mr. Magee thought i should find a theme
suitable to our class and elaborate on that,
perhaps something on irony and paradox in
our development at Grinllell.

The faculty was discussing the matter of
annual alumni awards. The Alumni Office
had presented theln with ten recommenda-
tions for what would hopefully he a rubber
stamp approval, But judging by the dis-
Cussion, the taculty was not willing to
rush the matter Should there be ten, they
asked? Were such-and-such candidates
suitably exemplary? Perhaps fewer of the
awards should be given at Commencement
and the rest on Alumni Weekend? As the
discussion continued for half an h0ur,l
remembered Mr. Grey saying the Week
before that the faculty really wanted to
discuss important issues and wishing they
could just get them on the agenda, Maybe
I'd heard him wrong. After all, there were
important issues on the agenda. Maybe he
meant to say ‘if we could just get to them
on the agenda ’ Or maybe the faculty
thought this was important. When the vote
was taken, the faculty approved the awards
candidates as recommended and without
revision

Suddenly something whlzzed by me. I turned
around to See Ken Christiansen leaving the
meeting. Right alter that people started
groaning and getting up to leave. Evidently
someone had called a quorum and there
weren’t enough people to continue. Mr.
Parslow was on the other side 01 the room
from Mr. Magee and myself. I tried to
catch him before he left, he had an ap-
pointment and couldn’t talk but I heard
him mutter something about my populist
theories of education

The day was almost over, so I headed
downtown to buy a newpaper. Approaching
the corner of 5th and Broad, I noticed
a group or 5 or e policemen and their cars
on tlle corner. The whole Grinnell force
must have been there. Soon, Chief Peters
appeared. “Well, hello ZX 5871”, he greete
ed me. It seems that Mr. Peters has so
frequently annointed my car with little yele
low or red envelopes that he knows my
license number by heart, As he came nearer
he lowered his voice' “Say Shelley, have you
heard any reports of a riot planned at this
corner today, We just had tip called in”.
I assured him I had heard of nothing As
I continued down the stleet, the humor of a

 

 

not at the corner of 5th and Broad Street
in Grinnell suddenly struck me. Afterstop-
ping for a nickel Coke at Tharpe's, Iwent
to the Varsity for my paper. The store-
keeper there was telling some people in the
back corner, “Boys, this isn’talibrai‘y!”

Still looking for a topic, 1 had arranged
an interview with Mr, Walker for the next
day at 12:30. On the way to his office,
i ran into Dave Rosenwasset rapping with
someone in Burling pit and stopped and
talked a few minutes with him. Unfortun-
atelyi Mr. Walker didn’t make it at 12:30
Maybe the Registrar's office next door would
have something. Things were pretty hectic in
that office. Mr. Seller was busy writing
a description of the new grading system, to
be attached to the history of grades in
Grinnell’s recent past, already several
pages long, that accompanies all tran-
scripts. Ms. Paul was collecting appli-
cations for incompletes from students, alas
mine among them. She winked at me asI
passed and assured me I was still in the
running for the record number accumulated
in one college career. Dubious distinction.

Passing Dave Rosenwasser talking to
someone else by the stairs on first floor,
I started to leave the library. For some
strange reason, maybe because of all the
reflections about the past that come with
graduation season, as I left the building
I remembered Phil Meats standing there
with a few others two years before in a
rather tame vigil protesting the Kent State
shootings. This was before the mass meet-
ings.

Things were pretty desperate. Maybe Ed
Hirsch could write some sort of poem as an
introduction to my article. So over to Langan
to try and find him. “Hello", I said, as he
opened the door. After listening to my Woes
Ed thought for a few minutes about what
would be the most suitable poetic inspirae
tion and then said, “Shelley, I think of
the various possibilities haiku would he the
one that best highlights the brevity and com-
pactness oi journalistic style". He just
happened to have a journal handy. “Too bad
you’re not giving a speech”, he remarked.
”l have a great poem about lips“.

But this still wasn’t enough for anarticle.
There was a meeting of the Joint Board
that night; the house presidents might have
some helplul advice.,So that night i pro-
seeded to Burling, greeted Dave Rosenr
wasser by the water fountain, and joined
the group in the Viewing Room. Eight people
were zit the meeting; Chris Johnson had
just called the question at hand. In the vote
that followed, the motion carried z»i With
five abstentions. Gregg Golden then moved to
question the semantic precision of the mo-
tion and the wording of the minutes of the
previous week, but his motion died for lack
of a second. Probably caught once again
in the reflective spirit of graduating, I re
membered the referendum presented to the
students two years ago to abolish SGA,
That was the year the Senate made Gaylord
the school mascot, and voted funds for his
provision, the year oi Jim Lew, Alice
Low, and the columns of Tom Greenfield
in Lloyd Gerson’s and Harry Fulton’s news
paper. At my iirst Senate meeting as Presie
dent, a year ago about this time, I learned
that Gaylord was one ot my competitors
in the recent election and had received a
write-in vote of ten, beating iohn Klein»
schmidt's dog hands down by eight votes.
But there were other Senate and Joint Board
meetings I remembered: the time the Senate
voted a policy of ciVil disobedience by plan-
ning mass participation in Illegal Visitae
tions in protest ofdormitury regulations; the
meetings during the BRIG strike and Kent
State; the Joint Board meeting with CBS
this December.
