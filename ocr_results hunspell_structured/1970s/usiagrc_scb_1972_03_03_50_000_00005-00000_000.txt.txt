Students lack Input

by Anne Walter

Ever since the academic pressure
issue last fall, Grinnell students and
iaculty have been bemoaning the iact
that something a bit intangible is
lacking lh Grinnell’s educational ex-
perience. It seems we are all doing
this thing alone-estudents do assigns
merits by themselves and only
comment to others on the difficulty
or length of thent. Faculty and stu—
dents seem to isolate themselves
witllin a discipline and regard others
as well, to the point where an underr
graduate biology major may iind
himsell regarded as strictly a bio-
logist (which he proiessionally,
isn’t) when at heart he is a poet, a
farmer, an administrator and loves
historical novels. The faculty is de
plorlng the iact that they really don’t
talk with the other members 0ftheir
departments on a professional level
much less with people in other iields.

It viable intellectual community
does not exist at Grinnell and the
concept oi liberal arts or broad
spectrum education has slipped to
the background while things of more
immediate application have taken
precedence.

I don’t think people are happy with
this Nor do Ithink “the problem”
ought to he discussed for its own
sake any more but rather ought tape
in the minds of all those people who
determine educational policy-~stu-
dents, professors, and such formal
organizations as the EPC’S, the
executive council and the admini-
stration. Intellectual community and
broad spectrum education can only
happen when we open our eyes and
ears and mouths to ask other people
what they are doing and thinking.

People are disgruntled but some-
what at a loss as to what to do about
it. As was acknowledged by some of
the iaculty, this is a high—pressure
place. Changing priorities is hard
under such circumstances. We need
the guts to do it and perhaps a little
guidance in how to go about it, l've
heard enough talk to think thatthere
are some things that might be done
as a'stiniulous; thus the suggestions

at the end or this article. However,
there is nothing that will be a magic
wand and take away this annoying sita
uation unless whole bunches of us
are saying “Screw it, I’ll do it"
and subsequently taking some kind
of personal action,

intellectual community and broad
spectrum education can only happen
when we open our eyes and ears and
mouths to ask others what they are
doing and thinking and share our own
thoughts and opinions.

The lollowing list of suggestions
is derived irom the rash oi meetings
last fall and comments that have been
made repeatedly this semester.
These things can only be catalysts
and Grinnell College can only be the
viable liberal arts institution that
we seem to want if each of us en»
deavors to make it that way.

A Personal Perspective

 

 

concern, laced with curiousity (and
legitimized by the title of Coordir
nater), put me at least on the peri»
phery oi the college community’s
recent and ongoing political acti-
vity.

Those of you who are more re
cent arrivals to this place might
feel uncomfortable with what might
seem uncharacteristically unremit-
ting attempts of late to possess the
library (or parts thereof). You have
also grown numb, I’m sure, to the
upperrclassman’s smug res
miniscences about past days of chal-
lenge and committment here--wnen
such cathartic climaxes were reacnr
ed more ireouently and for satisiy-
ingly justitiable causes. I refer
you to the sensitive perspectives
of Grinnell's Alan Jones'es for a
longer range assessment oi the
pattern into which all this fits: for
“not even” upperaclassmen cander
termine ii political activity here is
the function of some thrust of his-
tory or the mere return oi the pen-
dulum.

Suffice it to say that last semester
out student leadership--elected, ap»
pointed, and self-appointed (it's
self-incrimination time for me
folks)--confronted their roles ad-
mittedly unprepared to sufficiently
lead in the purposefully productive
yet anonomously articulate manner
we egalitarian Grinnellians wish.
That student leadership, likethe Ad-
ministrative leadership, felt shack-
led by a day-to:da‘y"‘operatlcn of

Rock Garden: A Second Thought

by Ron Medvl'n

I think that after writing these
columns for nearly three semesters,
lam beginning to learn or that mys—
tical power known as the Second
Thought. This is the power that
makes you like an album two
months alter you’ve told your friends
that your $3.99 was wasted. This
time it hit me with none other than
Elton John’s latest album, Madman
Across the Water. And who’d have
thunk that Doug Cloud would tell me
that this is a good album after he’s
vowed to “finish me” ii i ever men—
tioned Elton's name again in print.
This column is dedicated to Cloud.

Like all his other albums, this one
is heavily orchestrated in places.
However, I think the producer has
learned when violins sound good and
when they don't I STILL wish that
John would cut another live album,
so we could all see why he was
picked in (gaspl) Playboy as the best
pianist of 1971. His keyboard work
is too Often covered on this album.
And Taupin, although greatly im-
proving on his lyrics, still writes
some of the most banal lines ever
sung. However, John’s vocals are
tremendous I tllink he could sing
the National Anthem and make it
sound great!

The album, as the title suggests,
partially deals with a tour of the
states by Elton and company, Elton
oi course being the Madman. The
first song, “Tiny Dancer”, is dedi»
sated t0 the “seamstress for the
hand" It's actually a very beautiful
love song. John’s piano sways
through the entire number, niirr
rored by the orchestra, and the
sound is full and balanced.

“Levon“ Is the lnost “mystical”
song on the album, in the sense that
Taupin's lyrics are so vague as to
appear meaningless, ”Levon sells
cartoon ballons in town/His family
business thrives/Jesus blows up
balloons all day/Sits on the porch
swing watching them fly/And Jesus,

he wants to go to Venus.” The rest
gets worse, but the song is superb
because oi the music. John's singing I
has never been better. He sings the

chorus with a hard driving voice, ‘:

quite unlike the ”typical” soft sound

that we’re used to hearing irom him. :

The song sounds dynamic even ii
you don‘t know what it means.

“Razor Face" is another one oi j
Taupin's ego trips, but again it is ,
saved by John‘s piano and vocal. :

There is, believe it or not, a fast- _
moving jazz accordian solo. This,
.lack Emblow sounds like the Emer- ;
son oi the accordian world. On the .
whole though, this song is mediocre; j
it lacks the unique Elton John sound

oi the previous mentioned cuts. .

The title cut is one of the best. .
It's a slow, haunting ballad, Through ‘
more electronic wizardry, John’Si
voice comes irom iar away and,
gently echoes while the violins fol- ,
low his lead. The break uses the‘
strings at their best. It's a hard‘
staccato sound, which easily sug- .
gests the madness mentioned in the .
title. When Elton sings, ”Take my ‘
word rm a madmandon’t you know" .
you can believe it. .
The strings continue to be an 91— E
fectlve addition in “Indian Sunset” a
ballad previously done by Mary Tra»
vers oi Peter, Paul and. It was ,
written in 1969, and lthink it’s the
best thing John has ever done. The -
theme is trite, indians massacred
by the white man, a popular subject
tor songs these days. But John‘s '
stirring vocal leaves the listener .

stunned. It is both beautiful and
powerful. The anger and frustration
is in his voice as he sings, “I
heard irom passing renegades Ge—
ronimo was dead, he’d been/laying
down his weapons when they iill_ed
him full of lead.” The song builds
from the soft “a cappella” begin-
ning to one hell of a dramatic fin-
ish. This song alone is worth the
price of the album (if it’s on sale!)

The three following cuts are the
questionable ones, and after listen—
ing over and over i still think they're
sub-par. ”Holiday Inn” is about the
boredom of the road trip, and the
song is as boring as the road trip
no doubt. The mandolin and sitar
sound is nice, but does not save the
song. “Rotten Peaces" has that
“Border Song” gospel sound, But it
does not come near the power ofthe
latter song. And ”All the Nasties"
is easily iorgettahle except ior the
addition of a “Cantores in Ecclesia
Choir.” singing the last two lines of
each verse. It sounds like the Roger
Wagner chorus singing “Swing Low
Sweet Chariont." Four people burst
out laughing when they heard this
abominable mistake. ‘

The last song, “Goodbye” makes
up tor the previous failures. It’s a
quiet, soothing song, with just John’s
piano and very very soft violins.
Taupin’s lyrics, apparently written
about himself. are surprisingly
moving: “And if you want a drink/
just squeeze my hand and wine will
flow into the land/and feed my
lambs."

Elton John has proven himself to
be the star that we’d thought he’d
become. Most oi these songs are
excellent, and while this album is
not his best, it is certainly as good
as his others. He is in danger, how-
ever, of becoming stale. I hope he
decides to experiment a bit more in
the future. You can't keep on with
the same thing too long, or else
you’re left behind. on, and if only
Taupln could write...

The Scarlet and Black

March 3, 1972

From 2 Hot Issues

small-crisis management—- and it
was justiiiably attacked by students
and faculty for lack oi planning
foresight, and goalrnrticulation.

“Academic Pressure" was areal-
ity ior some while a symptom for
many. The Black community iound
catharsis, unity, and selfrrespect
in their response to the pressures
and irustrations ot Grinnell’s own
“benign neglect." The white com-
munity was lett confusedﬁor anger-
ed.

In the last couple weeks some of
us have watched both the Black Lie
brary issue and the Alan Nasser iSr
sueuclearly sympollo or sympto-
matic oi problems tar more hairy--
go through (and iorgive the Nixoniane
ism) at least two phases. Under mo»
derate black leadership the propo-
sal for a Black Library was first
carelully directed into the legitimate
channells-rwith even the lily-white
bureaucrats of the Student Coordi-
natur’s Office allowed to assist in
munching the daily diet of red tape.
It was in the mist of a 21/2 hour
committee meeting, littingly, that
the rug, was pulled out irom under
the approach and the more demand-
ingly impatient Channel-bypassers
began the route to the 20th Cen—
tury Room seizure.

In a reversal of these two apps
roaches, phase one of the Alan Nas-
ser issue was marked by channele
bypassing threats and rhetoric»
no doubt most often sincere. Ei-
ther the person, oiiice, or library
of Mr. Leggett had to be comman-
deered, the most aggreieve iaction
argued. Their honest concern gain-
ed for the student body a somewhat
informative public airing of the
issue. Perhaps phase two (to be
seen by some as subversively, un-
satisfyingly and bureaucratically
moderate) began when the Coordir
nator's Office filled the void of
options with a defined route to re
consideration in the particular case
and ‘a' 'rough' ’bilt'tangible' proposal
for improvement of the long—run
problems.

Perhaps it is premature for any
reilections. The issues are, or
should be, far from cooled. But
the Black Library proposal, not un-
scathed, has cleared the Library
Committee and this afternoon tem-
porarily rests awaiting approval
(or adaptation for the pa iatibility of
its backers) by the President. The
movement for student academic
power has temporarily broken into
task iorces in a notibly more rar
iional (and devastatingly tedious)
preparation for the long haul.

l, for one, am itching to learn
irom my own and my peers errors.
Allow me to overstate three such
lessons in order to balance the
conclusions other may draw.

Like a Hamiltonian pompous a-s,
I have been dismayed and dis-
appointed by the potential ior crowd
manipulation. It is manipulation,
of course, for which our office was
guilty Tuesday night. But the 027
her Students most concerned that
evening, we perhaps mistakenly con-
jectured, were content to call to-
gether almost 1/5 of the student
body, goose them with adrenalin, and
offer but two options: 1) the fruSr
tratibn (if either disintegration or
undirected continuation of a four-
hour meeting or 2) the occupation
of the library. The latter would
have occurred with what seemed a
embarrasssing, if not suicidal (for
student power interests), lack of
concern iorthe relationship oi tace
tics to goals (did Mr, Leggett have
de factu power to act on the tier
mantis?) and lack of understanding
oi the admittedly hear-cryptic pros
cedures and structures about which
demands were to be made. The
analogy was drawn to the “suc-
cess” (sic) oi the Black-Adminis-
tration negotiations last fall: it
might have been enlightening to ask
blacks about the degree of their sucr
cess. Black leaders have been
forced by the current American ful-
ture to become cautious and as,
tute tacticians--and, niayhaps, they
would have been quietly bemused by
our hasty sojourn to the library.

One could argue that no SGA Capi-
not could serve over one term--for
they are likely to move so far
away irom their peers in experi»
ence and perspective that they would.
be condemned to be viewed as re,
actionaries. One cannot deal dim
rectly and continually with the ad
ministration, faculty and com-
munity, it seems, without learning
to at times admit to the accuracy
of certain oi the latter's viewpoints,
without a recognition of the forces
that constrain them, and without a
peerralienatiug inability to stereo-
type the bunch of them as “the
enemy.” If student leaders are not
in accord with a faction which they
are supposed to represent, there
is a tendency, all too oiten, to
resort to the role or merely main
taining the channels which each SGA
inherits and which bind it to that
very “enemy."

Finally, I am disturbed by the ea-
gerness or some and the willingness
of other, to believe this community
can or should be seen as “good
guys" vs. “bad guys." (The latter
was described by some Tuesday
night as seemingly including all col»
lege faculty and stall.) The real
diiierences and variety among non-
students in this community belie
such a generalization At a time
when I and many others would like
to break down the estrangement be
tween students and iaculty so that
this might be a truly relaxed aca—
demic and social community ofscho-
lars, others argue ior drawing the
line more distinctly. (A few have
even been appalled when we suggest
that they solicit opinions from the
faculty before drafting demands that
may eiiect the latter’s careers, se-
curity, and treedom.)

Those three reactions may be over-
stated. I will be among those, alter
all, seeking to clarify and systemi-
tize student power in the deci-
sion making process: we have now
earned, we can learn, and the whole .
community can benefit by some such
improvement. Yet l Will also be
looking (or ways to gain the very
real power to be found in building
mutual good faith and trust with the
rest of the community. When it
comes time to select new student
leadership, moreover, I will be
shoping for a peer who has learned
from the mistakes of myself and
others, who is sensitive to the op»
portunities offered by the plateau of
activity which we’ve so very recent-
ly reached, and who most important-
1y, is committed to a more inclus-
ive and viable concept of community.

Mcltee Named
Newlibrariun

Christopher Mckee, assistant
director of Lovejoy Library at Sou-
thern Illinois University, Edwards-
ville, has been named to succeed
Henry Alden as college librarian.

McKee, who will assume his post
shortly after the end of the current
semester, was on campus last week
and met with the library comniiitee,
representatives of Concerned Black
Students, Students at a FDR dinner,
and Dean Walker.

The main queries met by Mr. Mc-
Kee during his short stay revolved
around 1) the black library proposal,
and 2) what changes he planned to
make aiier September I. In response
McKee very firmly, but judiciously
declined to answer, saying he was
not fully aware oi all the cil‘cumr
stances surrounding the Black Lie
brary and that he did not feel it his
prerogative to discuss any iuture‘
plans until such time as he has
oliicially‘ become the librarian.

Mr. McKee will return the first
part of June when he will start to
work with Mr. Alden to try and effect
a smooth change of command in
September. Until that time, Mr.
McKee might pay one more visit to
Grinnell and will definitely attend
the ACM Librarian's Meeting at
the Newberry Library in Chicago
March 2 and 3.

In addition to the title of librarian,
McKee will hold faculty rank as an

ssociate professor
