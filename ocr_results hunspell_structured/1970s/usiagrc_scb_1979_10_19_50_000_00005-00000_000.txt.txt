Student ooice ampliﬁed in contract decisions

by Dan Flynn
A quiet but nonetheless real revolu-
tion is occurring in the area of student
input into taculty contract renewal
considerations.
The Excecutive Council’s recently
released ”procedures for considering

analysis—

taculty members for contract ,
renewals, promotion, and tenure” give
students a much louder vmcc in con-
tract questions

In the past, the Student Educational
Policy Committee iEPCl served in a
more-or-less secretarial role for the
Executive Council, which ultimately
decides whether to renew contracts.
Under the new guidelines, the EPC
will play a more important advisory
role.

Under last year’s procedures, the
EPC prepared a report based on inter.
views with a random sample of
students, a sample picked by the ad-
ministrative assistant to the dean. The
interviewers had to use a set of ques-
tions “prepared by the Executive
Council in consultation with the aps
propriate academic departments."

One member of the Executive Coun-
cil had to be present during the
preparation at the report. The
guidelines suggested that the report be
in a very statistical lorm, presenting
first the questions, and then the
number of students giVlng the various
responses.

The guidelines said, “It the commit
tec members believe that additional
comments should he made on the
basis of their contact with the instruc-
tor, then those comments should be

clearly separated from the commenu
based on the evaluation of the inter-
views." ’

The effect of these guidelines was
that EPC did not write serious evalua-
tions of faculty members up
for consideration. They would compile
die required data, and maybe attach
brief additional comments at the end
of the report.

The comments were usually not ful-
ly explained, and often encompassed
only a few paragraphs. As a result,
the comments were hardly ever cons
sidercd. “when you aren't presented
with well-thought out, explained opi-

Now, the EPC is charged with sub-
mitting to the council 3 written
evaluation of the instructor, consider-
ing the individuals “performance as a
professional teacher, in the total pro-
gram of a department which is seen
as an integral part ot a liberal arts,
residential college...it should make a
thoughtful judgment of the instructor's
contribution...”

This evaluation should consider
points suggested by the department
chairman, but the EPC members
“should understand that this list is
suggestive only, and that they are ins
vited to elaborate on any points which

weight," explained one former council
member.

But under the new procedures, the
data gathering function is fulfulled by
the computer evaluations students till
out at the end of the course. '

they believe need it.;,"

For the first time in the history of
the college, students are being asked
to present a thought-out, detailed
evaluation of faculty members up [or
contract consideration. Implicit in that
request is an assumption that the
council will give due consideration to
the EPC evaluations. “Even ten years
ago,” one raculty member com-
mented, “allowing meaningful student
evaluation of iaculty members up for
renewal was unheard of."

Some students, however, still doubt
how much credence the student
evaluations will hold in the council.
Although the politics surrounding each
contract decision are complex, and in
each case the various elements, such
as evaluations by taculty members,
evaluations by the EPC, evidence of
scholarship, etc., will be weighted dif-
ferently, the tune of the guidelines
does imply that thoughttui considera-
tion will be given to students’
remarks,

As a faculty member pointed out,
”When you ask for, and are presented
with, a well-written, well-thought out
evaluation, you can’t ignore it,"
