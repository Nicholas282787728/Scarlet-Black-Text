on Monday, April 29, at 4:15 p.m.
Earlett has done extensive resea-

Peru and Costa Rica.

Her work has focused on the re»
sults of adapting to modernagricul-
tural technology which has resulted
in an increased dependence on the
capitalist market. This has otten
resulted in the widening of the
gap between rich and poor, she said.

Barlett will also be meeting with
Grinnell students in classes and in
a PDR dinner.

Halverson Views
Voertman Resignation

Bruce Halverson, chairman of the
theater department, released a eta-
tement to theater majors Monday
morning concerning the resigna-
tion of dance instructor Be tty Voert-
man.

The statement stressedthatthe re-
signation was unsolicited. Ditti-
culty arose when Voertman expres—
sed a desire to expand her directing
duties in the theater department.

0n the basis of their “professional
training and Experience," the other
members of the theater department
offered their opinion of her directing
abilitIES at Voertmrui’s request. lla-
lversion stated, “Her request was
direct and to the point. and ourans-
wers were altered in the same man-
ner."

The statement also affirmed the
department’s desire to have a “vi-
tal and exciting” dance program.
"We very much want this position
filled, and we will make everyeffort
to locate a dynamic and well-quali-
tied dance teacher."

For the year 1971-72 he held a fa-

Grinnell Makes .
Wall Street Journal

Grinnell College’s shared-contract
concept provided the lead for aWal]

, Street Journal story on shared -
contracts at Colleges and Univer-
cities.

The story -- which grew out of a
January story in the Des Moines
Register written by staff writer
Sherri Richiardi appeared in the
April 19 edition of the Journal.
Steve and Pat Brenner said in
the article that they took the 1'0th
appointment at Grinnell, which pays
$12,550 per year, to avoid sepa—
rate appointments at two colleges
separated by 50 miles of winding

mountain roads. .

Pat Brenner said that it both had
accepted those appointments “it
would have meantliving apar‘tduring
the week."

Extra Effort
Dean of the College Waldo s. Wal-
ker said that couples sharing u te-
aching contract at Grinnell "ex-
pend 125% on the job and add 9::-
pertise to small departments."
Other couples sharing Grinnell
contracts are Werner and Evelyn
Pluhar, Philosophy, William and
Elizabeth McKibben, classics, and

Louis and Merle Zirkle, art.
Several other colleges and uni-
versities have shared contracts,

including Stanford University, the
Massachussetts Institute of Tech-

noloy, Hamline University, Carla.
toil College, Oberlin College, Hamp—
Shire College, and Glistavus Adol—
phus College.
Private industry

The Journal story speculated that
job-sharing contracts might spread
from academia to the World of
Private industry.

David Meredith, a specialist in
manpower planning in New York,
said “There’s no Question that job--
splitting (in industry) will happen
in the reasonably near future."
Colleges report that Couples Shar-
ing contracts work harder than one
full-time teacher would. Oberlin,
in tact, bars each member or its
shared—contract couples from the
campus one dayﬂper week, Lepre-
Vent exploiting them.

ON THE
WAY OUT?

THE GRINNELL SCARLET 84 BLACK APRIL 26, 1974 PAGE 2

The present teleprinter terminal used in the downtown Computer Cent;all
would only be one option in the proposed new system which might be in-

stalled as early as next January.

Recommends New Computer

by Kyle Schaub

Error, error, error.

The bain of all computkr users is
that dratted message that theygoof-
ed somewhere intheirprogram. EV-
en if the mistake is as trivial as
a typographical slip, the computer
rejects it in the same dishearten—
ing manner as a major miscalcu-
lotion.

The Computer Services Commit-
tee and James McDonald, director
of comguterservices, have compiled
a report on computing at Grinnell,
recommending that 8 new computer
system be purchased. And oneoi‘the
beneﬁts ot‘the proposed change-over
is the reduction of the frustration
and time students now spend on de-
bugging error messages.

Old System

Currently Grlhnell leases compu-
ter time at the University of Iowa,
and has a rernate batch processing
terminal located in the downtown

.oft’ice building. Prof. Luther Erick-
son, chairman of the Computer Ser—
vices Committee, said that this sit-
uation cuts down the ready availa-
‘bility of computer time to the user.

To begin with, the physical 10:3-
tion represents an inconvenience
Since it is not on campus. Second—
ly, the mail delivery System lorre-
turning print-outs requires a‘arger

‘ time committment, since transmis-

sion is a one-at-a ime operation.
Priorities

in addition to the cumbersome

aspects of the present system, Mi .

Donald stated, "The academic use

of the computer had dropped the last

two, three years." However, the ad-
ministrative use has significantly
increased. This imbalance violates
the original reason for establishing
the computer system as "a tool for
the academic user."

The» r ,. 11 stated, “sevaral ad-
ministrative offices (are) either to-
tally committted to the computer or
heavily reliant on its services.” In
contrast to this comm‘ttmciit, only
ﬁve or six classes use computer
time as part of_a course require—
ment. This number excludes the
one-credit computer/calculus cou-
rse offered by the math department.
McDonald estimates the total num-
ber of students who “use the com-
puter more or less extensively”
to be lilo—2m.

New System

The new system would nip the
inverted Priorities back into their
proper perspective. Basic changes

include placing at least 16 termin-
als on campus in clusters of three

and four units to promote easy ac-
cess.

These terminals would operate on
a time/sharing system which pro—
vides immediate feedback to the
user since eazh terminal is indep—
endent of the others and no ‘ﬂvvaiting
period” for print-outs i involved.
Thus the time lag in receivingerror
messages would be out in seconds
rather than hours or days.

Advantages

“rv picture" cathode ray tube
terminals, along with the more tra—
ditional teletype model, would allow
the user to see graphs of experi-

would then permit controlled data
experiments to be run on the com.
Puter.

The new system can also respond
to original questions, based on st»
ured computer data. This feature
would permit reasearch tube done
by almost any department, in addi-
tion to the more common users in
the science departments, mathema-
tics, political science, sociolog
and anthropology.

McDonald arid Erickson also forsee
use of the computer by the an. and
music departments to create orig—
inal designs and compositions. 0t-

her departments, Such as hism .
have already begun accumulating

an original data base for future
analyzation.

in short, MuDonuid said, “Better
facilities moms you’rebetter ableto
meet the needs of all departments.”

Costs

The ongoing costs of the proposed
computer system wouldbe “appvdx.
imately the same. " accordingtu Mg.
DOled. The initial cost of buying
the System on a five year lease/
purchase arrangement does require
approval from the trustees as amn-
jor capital expense.

The repor. urges animmediatea .
proval so that the anticipated Si -
to eight-month delay from ordering
to installation will not be stretched
out any longer than necessary. The
report has been distributed to se-
veral trustees, and the crucial vo-

ting will take place a: the June ,

meeting.

Report

Several factors went into the de-
cision to draw up the Specific CDm17u~
ter report. McDonald, who is com»
pleting his first year here at Grin-
nell, was hired as a mllvtime Dir-e-
ctor to oversee and evaluate the
present system on campus. in this
respect, the College has made a firm
comm‘ttmrnt to use of Computers,
making a clear statement or dir—
ection a necessary task.

A secondreasonwas {ulﬁllingor‘e-
quirement for a National Science
Foundation grant application. if ac~
cepted, money from this source
would be used to finance extra
programs and computer time for
the acade to user.

Scope

The report makes ten basic rec-
ommendations that cover the entire
scope or the computing at Grinnell,
from defining the role of the Com-
pater Services Committee 00 the
establishment of a long—range c
puting plan to the possible fear: lll-
ity of placing terminals in local sc—
hool districts.

Errors in this computer program
will be up to the trustees to decide,
At the present, it carries the appro-
val of Dean Walker and other de~
partments.
