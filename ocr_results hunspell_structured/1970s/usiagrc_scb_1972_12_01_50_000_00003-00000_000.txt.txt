Several students, pet owners and one personnel met with Business
Manager Ralph Pomerenk and members of the SGA cabinet last Tuesday
in the South Lounge to discuss the proposed pet policy. The policy was
approved by the Joint Boards Wednesday.

Joint Board Passes Pet
Policy; Creates Rights Office

by Don Dagenais

Members of the Joint Board in a
five-hour meeting last Wednesday
approved a more stringentpolicy for
pet owners on campus, and created
an Office of Community Rights to
deal with the enforcement of col—
lege regulations.

The new pet policy was approved
after several weeks of debate and an
open meeting in the South Lounge
last Tuesday. Observtng that owner-
ship of pets “must be viewed as
a privilege rather than a right,"
the House Presidents banned from
campus all pets other than cats,
dogs, and small animals which can
be kept in cages or glass enclosures.

The policy will not be official unr
tii approved by President Leggett.
Student Coordinator Craig Kugisakl
anticipates that it will not go into
effect until the beginning of next
Semester.

Several rules regarding the owner
ship of cats and dogs were passed.
All such animals must now be lie
censed by the city oi Grinnell and
registered at a College office (to
be designated Iter) by the second
week oi each term. a college fee
of $5.00 will be charged, and the pet
must wear both city and college
tags at all times, Owners are re-
sponsible for all damage caused by
the pet and the animals will not be
allowed to stay on campus if they
“give grounds ior complaint by any
member oi the college community."

Complaints

Several acceptable grounds for
complaints were outlined. Damage to
college or personal property, the

presence of unpleasant odor in the '

hall, excessive noise, and improper
care will all be possible grounds
for complaint, Students wishing to
me such complaints may complete
complaint forms in the StudentCoorr
dlnator‘s Diiice. Any such com
plaints received will be directed to
a newly-created Pet Board (com-
posed of one student from the Com—
mittee on Social Policies and Reg-
ulations, one pet owner, and a per
son from the Dean of Student Af-
fairs office), which will decide whe-
ther or not the complaint is Justi»
fied. The accused will he informed
of the nature of the complalnt, but

the Campus twice to investigate Ins
cidents involving iirearms, and sev-
eral times more about incidents
which, it developed, were only fires
works. Campus streetllghts which
were shot out, he told the son, were
damaged by 22 callber weapons.
Regulations

College regulations state that all
students who keep a iirearm on Cam-
pus must register their gun with the
student Affairs Oilice, who will pro-
vide the student with n registrm
tion card and arrange for storage
in the Heating Plant building Stu-
dents will be provided 24 houl‘aCr
cess to their weapons In addition,
students carrying lirenrms on the
Campus will be required to have
them fully encased,

Any student who is not in corn»
pliance with the College firearms
regulations by 5-00 pm, today will
be subject to Article VI, Paragraphs
H and I oi the Trustee By-Lllws
which give the President authority
to immediately suspend a student

has no specitied right to iace his/
her accuser,

Should the Board decide that a pet
must be removed from campus, the
owner will be given at least seven
days to do so, unless the Board
specifies immediate removal. Shou-
ld the pet remain at the end of that
period, a fine oi $5.00 per day will
be imposed.

The new policy also allows resi-
dence hall floors to vote early in
the semester to ban pets from that
floor.

The Dean of Student Affairs of—
fice will hire a student to help
enforce the rules of the Pet Board.
The student will pick up unlicensed
pets and unleashed dogs in campus
and college buildings, and will as,
sist the Board in removing animals
in violation of the Board's decisions.

Community Rights

In other action, the Joint Board
approved the creation of an Office
of Community Rights, Observing
that ”as the present system exists,
the entire burden of protecting one’s
rights all too often falls entirely
upon the person whose rights have
been violated,” the Board created
the body to assist the Alerampus
Judicial Council in enforcing student
rights.

Six students, two Resident Advis»

Grey, McLaren, and Mrs. Okumu
will participate, with the entire sem-
inar chaired by Mr. Okumu.

Poet Barlow To
Speak Wednesday

by Irma McLaurin

The emergence oi new Black wrlt-
ers is,as strong today as it was
in the sixties. Among the ranks of
those vocal black men and women,
new names such as George Bar—
low arise. Mi". Barlow will speak
in the Black Library (Twentieth Cen-
tury Room) Wednesday at 8:00 pm.
A native oi California, Mr. Ear»
low received his BA. in English
from California State in Haywood
California in 1970. He completed
his work for an M.F,A. in English
and Creative writing at the Univer
sity oi Iowa in 1972, _
Mr. Barlow’s work has appeared in
five anthologies The Galaxy or
Black Writing, Laureate 1970, In-
tro ltd, Heartblows and Black Veil,
and the Broadside: Annual 1973,
The result of his participation at
the Writing Workshop at Iowa, a
manuscript titled Gabriel, will be
published by Broadside: in Novemr
ber of 1973, Mr. Barlow's poetry
is poignantly nostalgic as he speaks
of making love to the music of bul-
lets from a nearby Panther head-
quarters, or as he remembers the
pain Of a broken nose in childhood.
His realism in the title poem Gab-
riel bridges the gap between today
and yesterday.

ieties,

The role of education as a key ele-
ment in the modernization process
has been explored recently, and Ok-
umu and the other faculty members
hope to begin examination of the role
which education plays ln political
stability, which they see as another
key to mod ization.

The parti pants hope that through
observation of the materials neces—
sary and the problems which arise
in the course oi the seminar, they
can get a clear idea or the best
way to eiiect interdisciplinary study
oi any area~Latin America, East
Asia, the Soviet Union, Okumu feels
that often interdisciplinary courses
simply make no attempt to really
connect the disciplines, and hopes
this problem can be avoided.

Each participant will prepare at
least two papers, which will form
the basis of discussion at weekly
two-hour meetings. These meetings
will be open to students, with stu—
dents working on research projects
or senior theses in the area asked
to participate

The first part of the seminar will
deal with general questions, with a
core of basic readings. The second
will be a series of presentations
on more specific topics, dealing with
the specific diSCIpline of each pars

Chief Peters:

by Tom Grnuman
Police Chief Bill Peters is a very
understanding man. When Grandma
King calls as she did a few weeks
ago to complain that her neighbor’s
car was reﬂecting sunlight into her
iavorite window, he must under»
stand. The request was important
enough for the Police Chief to call
the neighbor and good—naturedly ask
him to move the Car. This is Bill
Peters, 3 man of equal popularity
in town and on campus, and the man
in charge of security in one of the
United States’ safest small cities.

peters is a native towny but he
has seen the world, spending nearly
eight years overseas as a ser-
geant in the US. Army. His twen»
tyrone years of army service car-
ried him into kamikaze territory in
the Pacific, The Battle of Okinawa.
and to Panama to instruct South and
Central American nations artillery
tactics Finally the old soldier came
home with the intent of allowing his
daughters to grow up in Grinnell.

“The only laws we’re going to en.
iorce are the ones the peoplewant’,"
Peters relates. This statement
serves to explain his attitude con-
cerning police intervention on cam,
pus peters appears at Grinnell Coir
iege only when summoned. He has
been known to loan uniforms and a
squad car to a student ior movie—
making purposes. It is no coinci-
dence that peters can say that he
has always been treated with com
Dlete respect by students.

Life at the police station rarely ap»
proaches Adamrlz proportions. In
1954, one of his officers was shot
by burglars, Last year, the depart-
ment handled a suicide—murder,
Last week, a college night watchr
man reported being shot at but Ins
vestigation yielded nothing but iller
gal firecracker explosion. Peters
also maintains that college girls are

planning, the structure of education
a1 curricula, the economic growth
and periormance, the philosophy oi
education and how all these relate
to political smbility Will be some
of the issues discussed

Part three will, in Okumu’s words,
“attempt to develop a general de-
linition of political stability;
ideology and institution bulldlng;at-
tempt to re-examine the socialist
contention that ideology is a better
basis for creating political stability
in plural societies.”

Along with concentration on the
specific topic of African develop»
ment, the seminar will also be con-
cerned with the relation of exercises
such as this to education at the
College. Anyone with a serious in,
terest in the area, even in discia
plines other than those of the par-
ticipating members, will be welcome
to contribute. Okumu hopes that vis—
iting lecturers irom the University
of Iowa and Iowa State will also
participate.

This seminar, and the subjects
which concern it, touch on some
very vital questions which must he
answered in the near future iprr
litical stability is to be achieved.
Okumu hopes that several of the la»
culty presentations will be material
for publication alter the seminar,
and that this will lead to continued
exploration oi the issue.

ninety per cent oi police time is

from iiremau to police chiei, her
lieves that a bar on campus would
be a "howling success” for a month
but rapidly extinguish as students

Furthermore, he does not regard a
campus bar as a security problem
but wishes Grinnell College would
establish its own security force any-
way. Peters was anxious only once
last year about Student attitude. 0!:

he admits he felt outnumbered “like
Custer” but was quickly relaxed by
the students’ temperament.

“i like people to police them-

would secure their bicycles better.
It appears as though Peters' inate
