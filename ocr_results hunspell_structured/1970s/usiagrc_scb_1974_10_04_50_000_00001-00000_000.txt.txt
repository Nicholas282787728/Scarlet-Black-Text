Brutus exposed
apartheid device

“We are going to Win. With
those words, Dennis Brutus ex
pressed his faith in the struggle for
Black freedom both in his native
South Africa and in the United
States.

Brutus, visiting professor at the
University of Texas, was the main
speaker during Black Cultural
Weekend Sept. 27 to 29. He spoke on
“African Liberation” and its
concerns in America.

African liberation concerns
Americans, he conveyed, because
racial oppressmn is the same
everywhere. “The enemy is not a
white man," he said. ”The enemy-
is the exploilation of people and the
denial of human dignity.” Those
“truly committed” to the struggle
for freedom are fighting for the
same goals everywhere.

A society is free, he believes,
when each individual is able to
“develop himself to his full
potential” and “each individual
has the power oi input, of influence
in the maintenance of that
society.”

The only difference between
South Africa or Rhodesia and
America is that in South Africa
there is an explicit plan, written in
law, to deny those rights of
freedom And the law punishes
whites and blacks alike for
violating that plan.

The specter of apartheid haunts
every aspect of South African
society from education to cenr
sol'ship to personal privacy. Ofe
ficial education policy says that
white children lnust be prepared
for a dominant role in society; nonv
whites for a subordinate role.

Thought is further attempted to
be controlled through strict cen-
sorship of all media. Even readers
of anti-apartheid material are

subject to imprisonment if prison ‘

does not silence the individual
execution usually does. According ,
to Brutus, South Africa has more
executions per almum than any-
other Western country and 80 per
cent of the hangings in the "free"
world occur in South Africa. 3
Abme all other devices.
however, the “Keystone. of"
Apartheid," Brutus claimed, is the
reference book or the “Book of
Life” A passport to nowhere
except further oppression, it
contains an individual’s picture
number, anda series of facts abou
him such as birthplace. language,
tribe, place of work etc. it must be ,
carried on the person and available
on demand to authorities 24 hours a
day. Having it in a chair by onc’s
bed is not sufficient and is grounds

for imprisonment.

Last year, 01,000 South Africans
were imprisoned for pass oiienses.
when a large group of protesters
turned in their passes to officials,
police opened fire. Ninetyesix
persons were immediately killed.
The officer in charge merely
remarked, “Next time, lhope we
will be equipped with better
weapons."

Passive resistance having failed
for 50 years, armed conflict is now
raging in South Africa and
Rhodesia.

And the iight does not just
concern the political
manifestations of oppression in
South Africa. it concerns economic
exploitation. According to Brutus,
the United States is inextricably
bound up in the whole affair. There

. are 500 American corporations and

all employ black labor at wages
one-eleventh to one-seventeenth
that of white n'firkers’ pay.

These corporations involved

Motors to Zenith. IBM prints the
reference books and Polaroids

Fellow who was on campus

varied greatly, Mr. Learsen gave
two lectures, talked in classes and
was available at many times to
talk with students informally.
Learson is former chairman of the
board and chief executive officer of
International Business Machines
Corporation as well as board
member of many other cor-
porations.

attitude,” commented one student.
”It seemed that a person could not
reach that kind of position without
having tremendous ruthless bent.
However, after close scrutiny, last
night as well as today, i am cone
vinced that at least in large
measure he was sincere and has a
welleintegrated philosophy which
goes far beyonda ‘profit motive.‘ ”

John Binecki, after Tuesday
night’s lecture on mum-national

Learson’s viewpoint oi the com»

Ten weeks of uncertainty ended
yesterday afternoon as striking
huildings and grounds workers
ratified a new twcirycal' contract
with Grinnell College.

Paul Neal, vice-president of
Teamsters Local 90, said the
workers voted to accept the con-
tract by a 2 to 1 margin.

The two sides apparently
hammered out the agreement
during a meeting Wednesday in
Des Moines that included Neal,
college atlorncy John Phillips and
ledei‘al mediator Joe Esselman,

included in the new contract are
hourly wage increases oi ‘16 cents
in the first year, retroactive to July
i ,and 25 cents in the second year.

Other provisions cover fringe
benefits and Working conditions,
vocations, holidays and longevity.
Complete details oi the settlement
will not be available until next
week.

Neal said several minor items
remain to be settled between the
two sides.

College president Glenn Leggett
Said the workers will return lo
their jobs Monday.

world is creating an addiction in
these countries to the Western
economyisomething which he
said is ”very dangerous."

The title of Mr. Learson’s
Monday night lecture was “The
Corporation: Responsible for
What?" ”I think 1 represent the
world’s most despised minority
group,” he stated early in his
speech He continued by saying
that a great percentage of the
public expects the corporation to
eliminate society’s ills. However,
he explained, the efforts of all
American corporations “ , . .
haven’t eradicated all pollution, all
poverty, all ignorance. all disease,
all traffic jams, not because they
didn’t want to, but because they
couldn’t ”

Learsen stated that as this truth
became recognized business
leaders and writers about business
“got tough. The business oi
business is business they
declared.”

But now,” he continued, “when
business decided to answer the
question, responsible for what, by
saying responsible for proiits they
found themselves facing an even
tougher problem then cleaning up
the rivers and Exterminating the
slum rats and getting the traffic
cleared up. They found themselves

telephones that were to have been
put in during the last month before
the college reopened in late
August.

The strike began July 25. A
previous lworyear pact had exe
pired July 1, but the employees
continued working without a
contract ioi- about three weeks.

Administrative personnel
handled essential services while
the strike was in progress. It will
be some lime before the iuil effects
oi the work stoppage can be
measured.

Several workers, who asked not

contract did not include what they
considered a sufficient raise, or the
cost of living clause which had
been a principal union demand.

However, they said most
workers knew that the College was
being adversely affected by
skyrocketing prices.

Campus reaction to yesterday’s
announcement appeared
somewhat muted. As one ad,

never been able to do—namely
convince the American people that
profits are good for the American
people,”

He wenton to explain that proiits
gave stimulus to productivity
which makes possible such things
as eighthour days and more fringe
benefits while allowing higher real
wages. He said that to meet the
expectations of the poor and the
uneducated it is necessary to in
crease the output per man. To do
that the goal oi profit is needed.

Learsnn Continued talking about
businessmen. “I think he (a
businessman) can think greatly of
business if he can see it as an
honorable part of an honorable
system, a system bigger than
business itself,” he stated. He
should contribute to society as a
businessman possessing the traits
oi “honesty, diligence, thrift, selfe
reliance, concern for his iellow
man. He will pursue profits but he
will pursue them while pursuing
these traits of character,"
maintained Learson. He em.
phasized that he knows and has
known many such businessmen.

Learson concluded by saying
that he hoped that through the
actions of such men, “business will
merit the good opinion of you and
those that Come after you through
the years ahead.”

Myths surrounding
multinational corporations were
the subject of Mr. Learson's
Tuesday evening speech.
“Tonight," he began, “I’d like to
address some of the more
prominent myths to point out what
I believe to be the facts.”

According to the first myth,
multinational companies are all
alike, Learson believes that it
didn’t make any difference
whether multinationals were alike.
“The important thing to look at,"
he warned, “is not how companies
are the same, but how they differ.“

Understanding these variances,
he continued, is essential before
imposing regulations, especially
since companies diifer so greatly.
Any attempt to force them into a
uniiorm code governing their
operations is apt to strangulate
some oi them.

Learson moved on to explain the
fallacy behind the second myth,
which deals with multinationals as
a function of size. Rather than just
size, Learson ielt a Company's
performance in a foreign country
was an important factor in the
company’s success. “Nothing
follows you faster,” he stated,
“than a bad reputation.” if a
multinational was a courteous
visitor and produced large profits,
other countries would welcome
industries in their nation.

Good citizenship while in a
hosting country is desireable for all
around profit, observed Learson.
He cites hiring local national,
obeying a country's laws, con-
tributing positively to the local
economy, showing sensitivity to
local culture all part of being a
good citizen.

Turning to the third inyth, which
concerns multinational play of the
international money market,
Learson explained profits flucA
tuated due to currency tran-
slations, not because of clandestine
activities. “With the changes in
exchange,” he clarified, “it can
produce a change in profit. The
profit change results from the
value of the dollar,”

multinational nation states are on
