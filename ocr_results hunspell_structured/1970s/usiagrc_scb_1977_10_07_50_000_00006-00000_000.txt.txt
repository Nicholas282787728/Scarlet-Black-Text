Some people have asked if the
movie Forbidden Games is a
pornographic film. The answer is
no, On the contrary, rorbidden
Games is Rene Clement’s anti-war
masterpiece. Probably very few
Grinnellians have ever seen this
film. If you have, it was probably
being broadcast on a Public
Broadcasting network station in
your city. For those who have
never had the opportunity to see
this masterpiece, it would benefit
you to make this movie a part of
Parents’ and Alumni Weekend,
For those who have seen it, it’s
doubtful you would mind seeing it
again.

Forbidden Games is perhaps the
greatest anti-war film ever made.
However, the movie does not deal
with actual warfare. The story

revolves around a young French
refugee, Paulette, who is orphaned
during the German occupation of
France in 1940.

PAULETTE wanders aimlessly
around the countryside and is
taken in by a family of peasants,
and she quickly becomes iriends
with their young son Michel. But in
the chaos of war, there is no one to
tell them what games to play, so
they create their own games. From
watching people bury the dead, one
children decide to build their own
play cemetery, using dead animals
dragged from the battletorn
fields, They are, in essence,
imitating the patterns of life
around them. This turns out to beat
subtle analogy to the wanton waste
of war.

Brigitte Foussey, who portrays
Paulette, was only seven years old
when this film was made. In this,

her film debut, she gives what may
be one of the most heartbreaking
and sensitive performances ever
seen in a movie, The masterful
photography creates scene after
scene of great pictorial poignancy.
Forbidden Games is perhaps one of
the best films ever made; many of
you should agree after seeing it.

MR. DEEDS Goes To Town is the
story of Longfellow Deeds, a writer
of greeting card verse and an
ardent tuba player in a smallrtown
band. When Deeds inherits twenty
million dollars from an uncle he
has never seen, swarms of greedy
relatives and lawyers descend on
him to beg, borrow and steal.
Deeds retreats to the big city
where he decides that his money is
more trouble than it is worth. His
plans to spread his wealth through
a commune are interrupted by a
court action attempting to declare

This film is a Collaboration of
director Frank Capra and
Scenarist Robert Riskin, whose
other collaborations include It
Happened One Night and Mr.
Smith Goes To Washington Capra
brought to these films the skillsp he
developed in directing silent
comedies while Riskin contributed
animpressive ﬂair for colorful and
fastpaced dialogue. Capra‘s films
have an optimistic bounce to them;
even though the wicked have me
upper-hand at the beginning of the
film. its a sure bet that the good-
natured and slightly simpleminded
hero will have the last word. Gary
Cooper (whose claims to fame
include being expelled from
Grinnell) plays Deeds and Jean
Arthur plays the tough reporter

parents, alumni

who falls prey to the Coops
charms Mr. Deeds Goes To Town
(1936) is 118 minutes long.

TIIE WEEKEND'S third film is
the choice of the Parent’s and
Alumni Day Committee. America
At The Movies will allow the older

Catch~22, Dr. Strangelove, Five
Easy Pieces. Take The Money and

one hundred movies are shown in
