Security Patrol} Starts May 4

by Michelle Casey

As a result of student cotilplaillls
arising over recent security probe
lems, and studenls’ opinions that
there is a need for more security
on campus, Deans Conliey Kimbo

/ and Jim Tedermau have taken steps
to establish a campus security pale
rol.

They are presently in the process
of interviewing Candidates and sale
ecting the members of the patrol,
who will be paid from Gi‘innell
College funds

The security patrol will consist
oi two students patrolling North
Campus and two patrolling South
Campus on Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday nights. Considering the lac—
tors of cost and the experimental
nature of the patrol, these times
were selected because students feel
that weekend nights are whena cal-n»
pus patrol is most needed because
many Students are out of their
dorms.

The patrol will be responsible
for locking residence hall doors on
the loggia at a designated time,
tentatively 10 p.m., on the three
weekend nights, and unlocking them
at 6 am. They will patrol the log»
gias, periodically making sure the

out their keys.

Some women students have brou-
ght up the idea oiutilizing the campus
patrol as an escort service; this will
be possible by calling the campus
operator, who will get in touch with
the patrol by a beeper system. it
someone needs the campus patrol
ior any security problem, he should
call the campus operator, giving
his name and where the patrol is
needed.

Student cooperation is a necessity
for the security patrol to work. A
system of issuing passes to guests
by resident advisers or hall presi»
dents has been in effect, but students
have not been following it, and it
is essential that they do in order
to prevent hassling oi guests by
the security patrol.

The patrol will check ms of people
sleeping in lounges as guests should
be sleeping in student rooms.

The security patrol will begin its
job next weekend, starting Friday,
May 4. The reason given for the
delay is that Deans Kimbo and Ted,
erman want to be sure the patrol
will effectively serve their func-
tion; the persons selected for the
positions will receive orientation
by talking with the Deans and Ch-
ief Peters before startingwork, and
students will have a chance to bar
come aware of both their own res—
ponsibilities and those of the patrol,

The security patrol will not serve
all problems; the deans feel that
most thefts are internal and elemr
eutary security procedures such as
locking doors and being aware 5hr
Duld be followed.

According to them, forcible enr
tries have been the exceptions in
cases oi campus theft, occurring
only a couple of times over the
last few years. The deans think
that going through a locked door
takes a lot more serious intent
than entering an unlocked room.

Dean Kimho does not feel there
will be a change in the atmOSr
phere of Grinnell as an open came

Penny Bank Stolen Sunday

by John Wylie

A large jar of pennies, valued at
around $25, was stolen trom the log
unge oi Norris hall in the early
morning hours Sunday.

According to reports of the incir
dent, three young men were admitr
ted to the building by a Buildings
and Grounds night watchman, to
whom they did not identify them
selves. The watchman was locking
doors on North Campus about 2:30
a.m.

The three then entered West
Lounge, where one student was stu-
dying. When they picked up the jar,
he challenged them. However, after
they “threatened him” he let them
leave the building.

Grinnell police were calleolntoin-
vestigate the theft. According to
Chief Peters, they have a good (I657
cription oi one oi thethree suspects,
and what Peters called an “active
load”

At least one witness to the theft
says he is “willing and able" Io
make a positive identlficntion of at
least one of the suspects

The suspect is described as a selfr

proclaimed Grinnell graduate, 5'8"
tall with a medium build, longbrown
hair, beard, mustache, and gold wire
rimmed glasses. He was wearing a
grey, hooded sweat shirt, jeans. and
pointed-toe cowboy boots.

in an unrelated incident, some dam
age was done to the floor of Darby
gym when an unauthorized party was
held there over the weekend.

Physical Plant Director Dale Hawn
noted that this was just one of many
problems associated with the gym.
He added that if the campus com-
munity is not more caretul of the
iloor’s easily damaged suriace. it
may sutier irrepairable harm,

Hawn also told the 5&3 that ins
stances of broken windows have bar
come so common that they are no
longer even reported outside his
office. He said that an average of
six windows are broken each week,
at a minimum cost of $750 each for
glass, plus labor.

He attributed most of the damage
to students who were locked out of
their dormitories at night breaking
a window to gain access to the
building.

provide security ior the campus.
He added that most campuses, even
small ones, have some security
force.

Since the patrol is an experimene
tal program, it will undergo an eva—
luative process, probably about one

, month into the fall semester, since

the few weekends left in this year
are not enough to iairly evaluate.
The patrol will be required to keep
a log; this will help determine to
what extent and at what times they
are needed.

Deans Tederman and Klmbo will
be working with the patrol out of
the mace oi Student Ailairs, and
they and sea will be involved in the
evaluation of it,

Women Prols’ Salaries lower

Women comprise 22.5 percent of
the Nation’s 254,930 fullctime col»
lege and university faculty members
on nine—and loemonth contracts and
receive average salaries that are
almost $2,500 less than their male
counterparts, HEW’s Office of Ed-
ucation (0132) announced Wednesday,

Compiled by OE’s National Center
for Educational Statistics, the data
represent estimates for the 1572-
73 school year and deal with instrue
ctional iaculty in public and private
institutions of higher education in
all 50 States, the District of Col-
umbia, and outlying areas.

These preliminary figures-reveal
that colleges and universities em»
ploy 197,633 men and 57,297 women

’ on nineaand 10»month contracts and

that the male faculty members earn
an average salary oi $14,352 an-
nually, while females receive
$11,865.

The salary gap is widest in the
Nation's universities, where men
receive an average annual salary
oi $15,829 compared with $12,325
for women, and it is smallestattwo-
year colleges where the figures are
$12,889 and $11,862 respectively.
The survey also reveals that only
9.7 percent or 5,565 of all female
faculty members have acheived the
rank of professor--compared with
25.5 percent of all males-rwhile
36.8 percent or 21,068 of the women
are instructors. Working up iromthe
instructor level, 36.4 percent of fe-
males are assistant professors and

17 1 percent are associate profes-
sors.

Although no strictly comparable
historical data exist, the on report
cites an earlier study of universi-
ties and certain other four-year
institutions to show that the propor-
tion of women faculty members has
changed little in the last 10 years,
rising from 19.0 percent in 19627
G3 to 20.6 percent in 1972-73. This
comparison (which excludes two-
year institutions) does reveal, how-
ever, a sharp rise in the proportion
of women with the rank ofinstructor
who now comprise 43.5 percentoithe
total for men and women as com—
pared with 30.9 percent of all instr-
actors in 1962763.

LUTH ER: DRUG
BUST TAKEOVER

(College Chips)-—Luther College students experr ,
ienced both a building takeover and a major drug
bust during the same week.

A group of about 300 students occupied the sch-
001’s administration building for 24 hours to
demand a greater student voice in college affairs.

Leaders of the demonstration emphasized that
there was no single incident which triggered the
takeover, but rather that a growing frustration
with the lack of communications between stur
dents and the administration was the primary
cause.

The group's four major demands were that an
entirely student—run Student Affairs Committee
be established, that an Academic Affairs Commie
ttee composed solely of students be formed,
that students get voting positions on the school's
Board of Regents, and that there be increased
representation tor students In the Community As—
sembly.

After the Community Assembly agreed to deal
with the demands, the protestors cleaned up the
building and released it almost exactly 24 hours
after they had dirst seized it.

Bust

Two Luther College students were arrested on
drug charges following an early morning search
of five student rooms on the Luther campus.

The raids were a coordinated effort Ofthe Winn-
eshiek County Sheriff’s Department, the Decorah
Police Department, and the Iowa Bureau of Nari
cotics. Undercover narcotics agents were involved
in the twoemonth investigation, which the school's
Dean of Students knew of in advance.

Dan Jothen, a Luther student, was an unwitting
accessory to the raid. He befriended a “cut of
town student looking for a friend” and let the
young man stay in his room.

The stranger stayed several days, went to a
couple of parties, and learned a great deal about
the habits of a number of people on the campus.

Following the drug raid. it was learned that the
“stranger” was, in reality, one of the twounder—
cover narcotics agents who spent time on the
Luther campus gathering information and evi—
dence.

DRAKE UNIVERSITY

(Tlmes-Delphlc)-»The Drake Major Attractions
Committee (MAC) is still plagued with major
problems _, the latest being a $2000 loss on the
recent Joe Ferrell jazz concert.

The Committee's problems began when the KRNT
Theatre in Des Molnes was shutdown in the fall.
When it left, it took with it the usual home for
major Drake concerts but also a great deal of the
technical expertise on which the Committee had
come to rely.

A combination of technical failures and temp-
remental performers led to the by»now famous

disaster when Taj Mahal “appeared” in concert
for Drake Homecoming. The loss on that concert
has now been set at $3100.

But there is one bright spot W singer—guitar-
ist Richie Havens has been signed for a concert
Sunday in Hoyt-Sherman Auditorium in Des

Moines. According to MAC oiiicials, there will.

be performances at 7:30 and 10:00 p.m., with
reserved seats selling for $4.00.

WARTBURG COLLEGE

(Trumpet)~Warthurg College has added a new
major in Communications, which will be imple»
mented in the fall.

The new major will be under the jurisdiction
of the speech-journalismrdrama department, but
will be truly interdisciplinary in scope, involving
a number of other departments.

According to College officials, the new major
is designed to “broaden career possiblities for
students in such areas as public relations, radio,
journalism, sales, personnel interviewing, and or-
ganizational communications”.

BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY

(Justice)--About sixty members oi the Brandeis
University .Third world Coalition seized control
of the University's administration buildingto sup-
port their demands ior increased iinanCialaidfor
minority students.

The group, which represents black, Asian, and
other minority students in the Brandeis commun-
ity. Their demands included a $200 raise in
grant money irom the University to cover full
need. the “recycling of Third world attrition
monies back to Third World admissions, and an
increase in the size of the Third World com.
munity back to the 1971 level.

president Marver Bernstein obtained a restrain-
ing order against the occupation, and the demonr
strators leit the, building late in the alternoon
oi the day they seized it. He noted that no agree~
ment between the administration and the students
had yet been reached, but that talks were con
tinuing.

MACALASTER COLLEGE

(Mac Weekly)~Macalester geography proiessor
Dennis Asmussen will leave the College at the
end of this year to periorni environmental re-
search for MPIRG (the Minnesota Public Interest
Research Group).

Asmussen cited the open yet eiiective structure
of MPIRG as a major factor in his decision.
The group has won victories in several impor-
tant environmental areas, he noted, while still
retaining an open, unregimented feeling.

This open atmosphere is not possible in the
academic field, he continued, and this, coupled
with a desire to do something personally about
the environment instead of just talking about it,
were the primary considerations in his decision.
