I Don’t Know

We saw a politician with real courage the other day. and we
think he deserves at least a brief “thank you."

The politician was William Gannon. candidate for the Democra-
tic gubernatorial nomination. He was in Grinnell for a few hours.
to discuss his views on certain issues and answer questions.

One question dealt with finding jobs for Veterans. It was a
perfect opportunity for a glib generality that said nothing but
sounded like a good idea.

Gannon resisted the temptation. Instead. he admitted that he
hadn’t yet had time to study the problem. and therefore had no
plan to announce. He added that. when he did have time to
think about how more jobs for Iowa‘s veterans could be found.
he would be glad to discuss the issue.

It's really a little thing. But it was certainly encouraging to find,

a public figure with the courage to say “I don't know."
In cases like this. it’s a phrase we would like to hear more
often. - , /

Protecting

the ‘Trustees

Consider it the same as a published announcement. When the
WET PAINT sign appears in the Burling basement men's
lestroom. the Trustees can‘t be far behind.

Every year, without fail. the restroom is given a whitewash job
institutional beigel in Buildings and Grounds version of the
popular student program “Paint Your Own Room."

The pen is mightier than the sword. so the saying goes, but
hat fails to account for the devastation wrought by a B&G man

urned loose with a paint brush.

‘ What lies behind this yearly act of destruction? Could it be that
‘ ome unknown source is afraid that the Trustees. in a moment

-f pensiveness. may look from where they are sitting to find
‘ome offensive. unadulterated expression of human emotion?

They have probably read better in their day, and are more

han mature enough to handle whatever a Grinnellian may

hoose to scrawl on the bathroom walls.

Perhaps. however. there is another reason. Someone is trying

keep the Trustees in blissful ignorance of what really
omprises the Grinnell Experience. A few moments of graffiti
tudy would probably provide a truer picture of the College than

n hour of open discussion with student leaders, .

Trustees only regular Contact with the College comes through

eading the Scarlet and Black, the Grinnell Magazine. and

‘egular epistles from the Office of the President.

.None of these will provide statements like the scrawl on.one
iartition: ”If Grinnell hasn't fucked you up. chances are..."

hances are. they wouldn't find a better list of Grinnell's
uroblems anywhere else on campus n and the problems aren't

onfined merely to budget and admissions.

Strangely enough. the graffiti destruction is not systematic.

ross the Burling basement corridor, and you will find no WET

'AINT sign adorning the door to the women's facilities.

Have we in our Victorian concern. failed to consider the women
-n the Board? Someone has failed to show proper consideration

or these women -- aren't their facilities just as deserving of a

hitewash job as the next bathroom?

Perhaps there is a more cynical purpose. Grinnell has a number
f young Trustees -- men who have graduated since Burling

ibrary was built. Is there a pervading fear that a Trustee

ight find some youthful indiscretion lurking in a dimly lit stall?

Or is it the fear of the Nollen House inmates that some ﬂeeting

bought from their days in residence in Burling Basement might

ave been recorded for posterity?

We must speak up now. while only our graffiti is threatened. or

he next victim may be the allrcampus jag -- and then how would

.cademic pressure be relieved]? '

We should view this white-wash job. however. as only a

emporary setback. For every B & G man with a paint brush

an be found a student with a cartridge pen in hand who has to

e reminded to let the paint dry before they espouse some
rrofundity. Three weeks and the bathroom wall will look the
ame with the same names appearing in their honored spots of
-steem.

What is disappointing is that the Trustees have been denied

his unique cultural experience.

Manheimer: Ouesiions‘Music Fees

To the Editors:

1 am writing this open letter in
order to publicize the Concern on
the part of students about the dis-
bursement of college funds. This
concern is raised in defense of
students who. after paying tuition.
must pay again to participate in
college accredited programs. The
pertinent situation is the funding of
the studio lessons offered by the
music department. students wishr
ing to take voice or instrumental
lessons must pay individually an
additional one hundred dollars Each
semester. For the fee, the Student
as a norm receives one half hour
lessen each week and two credits
icr each semester (limited to eight
credits of practicum in toto). lbe-
lieve that the present arrangement
is inequitable for students particir
pating in this program.

If a student is scheduled for less
than eighteen credits in a semester
and desires to take music lessons
through the college. he should not
be charged an extra one hundred
dollars for a program uttered with
in the curriculum of a liberal arts
college.

i have inquired about this matter
and have nu qualms with thejusti-
flcatlons proposed. The practice
rooms need maintenance work. The
cost of lessons for scholarship stu-
dents must be defrayed by supplir
mentary funds. The instructors
brought in from Iowa City or Des
Moines must be paid. The justifica-
tions for the funds are quite appror
priate.

However, the cost of instruction
should not be a fee shouldered
solely by the music students. The
salaries of teachers brought in
should be provided for in the tui-

tion paid by the students as are the
salaries of the professors in the
other departments. The cost of
maintenance is the concern of the
entire college as is the upkeep oi
the pyschology or physics labs. The
necessities of the scholarship stu:

dent are not only the concern at
music students, but at all students.
it a scholarship student signs up
for music lessons, it should not
mean that music students alone
defray the custs incurred. li a
scholarship student takes a phy~
sics course. nu ice is imposed on
other physics students nor should
there be one. '

The music department and the mur
sic practicum program is the lip.
ancial responsibility oi the entire
college. Instrumental instruction is
on par with instruction given in any
other departmentandshould beiund-
ed in a similar fashion.

‘ i am limited by the lack oi avail-

able information on this matter,
specifically the financial details.
I do not know, consequently. ii what
I suggest is feasible. 1 intend only
to bring this matter up publicly in
the hopes that a new perspective
may be gained. The financial priorr
ﬂies and allocations of the college
should be modified to distribute the
financial responsibility more equitr
ably.

The many student recitals, .the
College Singers and Chorus. and
the orchestra draw directly from
the music department. The benefits
oi music instruction to the college
are ubviuus I. therefore solicit any
response from the administration
that might help to alter the present
situation.

Sincerely,
Robert A. Mannheimer

Buntz‘: loo Grade-oriented

To the Editors:

Two days ago I received a clipping
from the S & B entitled “Three
'Ex-Students Explain Dissatisfac-
tion." The letter raised many
questions and motivated me to
write this letter to the S 84 B. There
are many things which I would like
to say about Grinnell. but at this
time I will restrict my remarks to
one topic. the so called “Academic
Pressure" at Grinnell.

in the past iew years. Grinnell
College has become a highly comps.
titive school. I believe that “Ache
demlc Pressure" has been a function
of this competitive. grade oriented
atmosphere rather than a function
of the amount of work that
professors assign. The “what did
you get" syndrome has hit Grinnell.
The day the exam is announced
there is a general. “how can we be
expected to know all that by then?”
A typical reaction. In the next week
or so you might give or receive it
few. “how much studying have you
done for the exam?” Perhaps it's.
“how many books have you read for
the paper?" Then it begins to
snowball. The night before the exam
the question becomes. “how do you
think you'll do?" You walk out of the
‘exam and it's. ”how do you think

you did?" The exam or paper is
finally returned lat Grinnell that
could be monthsl and you hear or
ask. “What did you get?" We are all
guilty of it. it just seems to creep
up on us and changes from inter-
ested inquiry to pressure. This type
of pressure is found under that
greatest of all five-dollar college

categorical headings. peer group .

.pressure.

The authors of the “Three Ex~Stu-
dents" letter told of writing paper
after paper at Grinnell. Think of
how much easier those ten page
papers wold have been if we had
spent more time discussing concepts
than we did discussing and worry-
ing about grades. Prolessors could
also have helped the situation by
getting papers and exams returned
as soon as possible so that 1) we
would not be left to wonder how
we did and zlwc could get a good
idea of what a particular professor
expected so that we could study and
write accordingly.

The syndrome can be stopped if
Grinnell students as well as faculty
act collectively, but it it is ignored it
will continue to destroy a lot of good
minds.

Sincerely.

Robert A. Buntz Jr‘. Dec. 73'

Knapp: Answers Horecky

To the Editors:

Mr. Horecky’s letter of Mar. 22
brilliantly displays the very totali.
tarianism he warns of. The author of
that letter apparently feels that in
order to be a participant in political
affairs. one must not only have a
position. but that it must be the
same position that Horecky has.
This is an outrandrout denial of the
validity of the right of opposition.
While Horeck obviously believes
very deeply in his causes. doesn‘t
the individual have the right to
another View? Do we all have to
believe in McGovern to be counted
as “politically active?" Mr. Nixon is
in deep trouble because he refused
to let Americans make up their own
minds Without his intervention; he
had the audacity to believe that his
way was the only right way. Are
persons much closer to home guilty
of the same thing? .

Render: Sees
Cultural Conflict ‘

To the Editors:
Contrary to ro'orner. there are
Jews on this campus who observe
the holidays of the Jewish calenr
dar. i am amazed that no one in
the planning committees of ‘social
events will take this into considr
eration when they pick a date for
a major event. The ”Spring Fling"
coincides with the Jewish holiday
of Passover on Saturday April
6th. I had hoped that my letter
concerning the selection of the
weekend of Yom Kippur. the hols
lest day of the year for Jews, as
parents weekend. would have in-
stilled som‘e semblance oi respect
for minorities on this campus.il
certainly would not plan a party
on Easter Sunday or any Holy day
and I hope in the future events
will be planned with this consid-
eration in mind so everyone will
be able to participate in the
College's activities.
