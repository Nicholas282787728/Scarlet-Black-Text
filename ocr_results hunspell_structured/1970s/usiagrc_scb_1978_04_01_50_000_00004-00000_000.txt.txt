N1x CSL’S picks;
fix their tricks

This cannot be happening, can it?

Before break, the Committee on Student Life ‘CSLl. in a
move reminiscent of the strong-arm tactics of Boss Tweed
and his cronies, rejected the food boycott policy proposed by
the SGA and instead substituted their own, which President
’l‘urner later accepted. This week, however, the CSL just
went too far. Their latest proposal, which mandates that only
blue~eyed. blond»haired students of Western European
heritage will be allowed to eat in Quad, smacks of elitist
despotism. Needless to say, we don’t like it. ‘

Students must not, cannot be silent in the face of this
invidious usurpation of their rights, We have the right to eat
anywhere we likeiand the CSL statement about Quad and
Cowles being “separate but equal facilities” is neither
comforting nor appeasing.

-President Turner, who signed the last CSL proposal into
policy, is expected to do likewise with this one, despite
considerable objection from Joint Boards. As Turner said
earlier, “it is the Committee's responsibility to recommend
policy to the President. It is the SGA's position only to
comment on these proposals And their two-cents ain’t worth
diddly-squat on this issue."

What is this, a smelly little banana republic? Is Turner
and his junta going to dictate policy to the entire campus?
We hear some of their next projects include reinstating
admissions quotas for minorities, reviving fraternities, and
sanctification of Dale Hawn.

If Turner and the CSL are allowed to put their latest
proposal over on the students, who can tell where they'll
stop?

Letters to the ed.
But we like Howard K. Smith

Dear Editor l: Who writes these
SM} editorials? They sound like
poor imitations of Howard K.
Smith or William Saphlre as they
scold the students of Grinnell tor
not acting like adults. I thought this
was our newspaper i thought it
was written by students for
students. Instead the 5818 seems
more interested in adopting cans
descending Journalism 101
language that is totally alienating

Editorials such as your recent
one on the SGA ballot ﬂooding
seem aimed at achievmg a tone
that of a more ”Serious responr
Sible” person rather than
examining any of the motivations,
implications, or humour behind the

, event.

I remember reading a similarly
liumourless editorial last year
about the OB Squad. That was

when the S&B's were put in
people's boxes. Now they sit in
stacks on the post office counters,
gathering dust as the week wears
on until Ernie puts them out of
their misery,

As lor “this latest bit of
foolishness" as you call it, the ﬂood
of nominations showed more
imagination and told us more
about what is going on in this
campus than a semester's worth of
