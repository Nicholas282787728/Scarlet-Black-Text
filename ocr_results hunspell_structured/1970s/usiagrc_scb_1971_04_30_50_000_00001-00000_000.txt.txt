Symposium: A lot For A Few

by Bill Thomas

The Alternative Media Symposium which came offlastSunday,

Monday, and Tuesday managed to generate considerable inter'
est and discussion among a few students. Those who took
advantage of the presence of several representatives of the
"underground" media engaged in practical workshops, theo-
retical arguments, and political debate, not only during the
scheduled meetings, but also into the early hours of the
morning.

Attendance was very low at many of the events, no doubt
because of the heavily- laden calendar of the preceding weeks
and the nearness of finals. A stimula ting last-day schedule,
written by Lorenzo Milam of KTAO and the KRAB nebula,
increased the number of students present at Tuesday's ses-
sions. Most of the symposium participants, however, were
satisfied to work with small groups. The general feeling was
that more meaningful communication could happen among
groups of five to fifteen. Probably the least successful session
in terms of discussion was the Cold Shot movie on Tuesday,
which had an audience of 50-60.

The symposium schedule was mapped out day by day by the
Grinnell committee and the “media people" together. The
workshops reflected the diversity of the participants. One of
the most forceful and stimulatingpersonalities at the symposium
was Lorenzo Milam. Having had a hand in starting three non-
commercial radio stations, he is currently operating a strange
commercial station in Los Gates, California, KTAO. But the
biggest stir at the symposium was probably not Lorenzo's
mind (Which was compared to many interesting things) the
videotape machine used by Skip, of Videofreex, and also used
by every student that Skip could get to try it. He said at the
last session that he thought that videotape was going to make
everyone into actors, producers, and audience, and he hoped he
had helped to de-mystify videotape technology for Grinnellians.

People also spent a lot of time with two men from KPF’l‘ in
Houston. Jeff Scherow, who, before getting into radio had
started two underground papers, including New York's Rat,
