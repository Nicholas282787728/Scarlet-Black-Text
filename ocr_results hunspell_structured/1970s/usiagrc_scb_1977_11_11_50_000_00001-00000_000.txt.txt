to the problems she confronts as
Chail'mtin that is characterized by
a wide variety of experience and
interest. A residenl of Des Moiiles,

position as Chairman of the Board
of Trustees, she is very active in
volunteer work and has a strong
interest in the arts and in govern-
ment. She has been on the Board of
Trustees since 1970, and served

 

several times a year in an attempt

to sense what is going on," she,

said.

Since becoming chairman in
1973, there have been many
significant social and political
changes that have affected the
academic community both
nationally and here at Grllincll

national decline in political ‘ .

Significant for Gl‘iniiell, This
change resulted in what she feels
was “a lessening of tensions from
the outside world that affect the
college student " Furthermore.
she cited the naming at Turner to
replace retiring president
Glenn Leggetl in ma as another
change of major importance
during her term of office,

BUCKSBAUM described last
Week‘s meeting as “a lot of work.”
and said it was dominaled by two
major issues, the portfolio question
and the capital campaign (see

stances, the more ramifications of

becoming chairman in 1973.

Her chief duties as chairman are
primarily administrative She
presides over the three annual
trustee meetings. She also tries to
manage the board as an
organization by doing such things
as involving board members in
activities to which they are best
suited and recruiting new mem-
beis. Her most important job,
however, is to remain in constant
consultation with Turner and
others about the college.

me posted on what goes on at the
college. I also am contacted by

She also said she would support the
decision of the Board on this issue.

Affirmative Action has been
another major issue on campus,
The presence of four
separate Affirmative Action
committees at a school of slightly
more than 1200 shows this.
Bucksbaum said she is pleased
with current college policies in this
area, She said the current Af-

policies “will be helpful” in
preventing what Turner has
described as the “spectre of white,

together "

Board to

, ,, ByJuiic Brand

The Trustees' meeting held last weekend resulted
in the release of the list of college investmenB and
the appointment of a corporate investment officer
“to monitor proxy solicitation material” for the
finance committee of the Board of Trustees.

The Board also stated that “the college as a
corporate body smtes no position on political issues
To do so would be contrary to the requirements for
academic freedom ” ,

THE TRUSTEES issued these statements as
guidelines to the 1973 resolution on corporate
responsibility The main body of that resolution said

,that “the Board has an ethical responsibility to}

exercise its rights as a shareholder to influence
corporate policy insofar as it effects the general
welfare,”

“The College portfolio will be available as soon as
it is typed," according to college treasurer Robert
Anderson. He expects it to be ready sometime next
week. Also, the annual sLatement will be made
public within the next three weeks, according to
Anderson.

THOMAS Hutchinson. vice chairman of the
finance committee, explained that “most members
of the board weren'tvaware that the portfolio was
private before. it seems it used to always be open.
We felt the campus community should have full
View of where the endowments are placed," he said.

Fritz Maytag, the newlyeappointed corporate
investment officer, commented, “My role is simply
to revtew any questions concerning proxies and to
bring them to the attention of the finance committee

 

reveal stock

so that it’ may give a recommendation to the"
treasurer for voting," ’

IN RELATING this to the current controversy
surrounding US, businesses in the Union of South
Africa, he said, “I'd be reluctant to Say that any
proxy about South Africa or any issue would be
automatically brought in the committee's attention.
but I could guess that it probably would."

He emphasized that the Board ”took students’
interests seriously. I don’t think there will be any
attempt to avoid the issue. If there was any unr
Certainty over the issue, it was how to go about the
actual formalities of reviewmg proxies.

“WHAT CAME out of this meeting was the
general agreement thatonce one accepts the idea of
financial stockholder responsibility, there are many
ways to approach it. Proxies are one way, but the
Board consensus Seemed to be that selling stock is
not a very original or effective way” of dealing with
the problem

Maytag continued by saying “as far as initiating
proxies are concerned. we'd probably steer away
from that.”

WHEN ASKED whether the South African
situation should be considered a political issue.
Maytag felt that the Board had not decided how to
treat the issue. Personally. he sees lhe problem as
having moral and political ramifications.

“(It is) both a political issue and one of liulnan
rights. My impression of the Board's discussion is
that they feel strongly that, as an educational ine
stitution, tthe schooll can't taken stand on political
