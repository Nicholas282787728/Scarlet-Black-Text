” SGA
revises

If you are a married student
involved in a hall dispute who
drinks and owns an untagged pet,
you will be greatly affected by the
results of Wednesday evenings
joint board session of SGA. If not,
well, judge for yourself.

The board’s main consideration
was a proposal by Bob Jacobs and
the Social Policies and Regulations
Committee to restructure the
Office of Community Rights.

At present the OCR structure, as
defined in the Student Handbook
and the SGA Constitution, consists
of three teams, each with an RA
and two students. In actuality,
hovever, only two functioning
teams exist, due to “a unilateral
decision” on Jacobs part.

With the present structure, the
team that gets involved in disputes
first usually does so on a
mediation basis and hears both
sides. Therefore, the 5? dz R feels,
they would not be able to present
an unbiased case.

The main part of the restruc-
turing proposal would establish
three definite groups. Two groups
would represent North and South
Campuses. One group would be on
a standby basis to be used as
advocate or defense for a Judicial
Council hearing, In a dispute,
therefore, the two groups not in-
volved in mediation would
represent both sides before a
hearing,

The proposal, however, would
mean a change in the son Cone
stitution. That, according to the
SGA Constitution, requres ape
proval at two meetings and a
campus vote.

SGA also gave final approval to
three other SP 8: R proposals. On
the policy of student marriages the
Student Handbook will now read,
“Married students may
automatically be allowed to live
off—campus regardless of class
standing or they may draw into a
double room during room draw or
request assignment to a double."

The law applies only if both
partners are enrolled at Grinnell.

A minor change in the alcoholic
beverage policy removed two
students from the subcommittee
which acts on applications to waive ,
the prohibition of alcoholic con-
sumption at functions not in college
housing or the Puh.1t was a move
for expediency’s sake, apparently.

SGA’s other major business
included appropriating $200 from
its TV fund and $100 from its piano
fund to finance the Loose Hall Ball,
which was running critically short
of funds. SGA President John
Hansen said financial shortages
have plagued student functions all
year, largely due to low
enrollment. For nest year,
however, the Board of Trustees has

. granted SGA an additional $18,000.

Finally a committee was
established to investigate the ef-
fectiveness oi the new Hall
nepresentative and Coordinator
system set up oils Fall.

New kid on the block:
handbook Interview with Turner

President A. Richard Turner
presented his views on the present
liberal arts education Monday
before a meeting with the staff of
the Scarlet it Black. Turner
discussed college issues, with
academic pressure, tuition, tenure.
and student attitudes emerging as
the predominant topics.

“The place is very uptight”
about academic pressure, Turner
remarked. The “underlying
assumption” informing academic
pressure, according to Turner, is
that the student feels he has to
excel at everything he does.

Turner’s motto is “punting.”
Punting to Turner means laboring
diligently at one area of interest,
while not worrying about others as
much. Bewailing the student who
settled for all “B’s”, Turner en»
couraged students to ”shoot for the
‘A‘ ” in one course while allowing
another to slip to a “C.” He
realizes that this idea is “flying in
the face of graduate schools, grade
point averages, and everything

L. e

The existence of academic
pressure was recognized as a
definite reality by Turner, who
explained that “it‘s perceived. . .
therefore it’s real.”

Along the same lines, Turner
disliked the grade erase system
currently being employed at
Grinnell because it denies that a
student can fail. “That a student
can receive a “D" or an “F” is
something which should be
celebrated,” Turner exclaimed,
otherwise, he continued. failure is
hidden or not admitted,
presumably in order to look better
for graduate school. “Aren’t we
really selling out to other people
and other pressuresi”, Turner
queried.

Turner subscribed to the notion
that tenure locks the College into
an expensive operating cost.
Grinnell is a little over half tenured
which is considered good, Turner
said, but it presents problems in
hiring minorities. Black and
woman recruitment efforts are
adversely affected by the tenure
system and by the difficulty in-
volved in attracting either group to
a small town like Grinnell. Grinnell
does not have a black orvsingle
community; nor can it offerurban

working opportunities for female
prufessors' husbands.

At present, tenured faculty are
predominantly white and male,
leaving little real chance for
minorities. In addition to the
question of minorities, an issue of
future quality of the tenured
faculty arises, Turner suggested. A
professor may be exemplary when
he is tenured at age do, but years
later at say, 45, it may be a dif-
ferent question. That question
Turner would like to explore.

Dorm renovation is under
consideration, Turner admitted,
although refusing to quote any
specific monetary figures under
consideration. Turner toured all
North and South campus dorms for
two and a half hours, before
meeting the press, finding many
weaknesses, particularly in Mears
and in Cowles Lounge. Turner
added that the project was not of
the highest priority, however, and
might be shelved for more pressing
needs.

The trustees of the College
visited the campuslast week for an
extra unscheduled “get
acquainted" meeting with the new
president. Several formalities
were transacted, including the
acceptance of former president
Glenn Leggett’s resignation, ap-
proval of Turner as president and
as a professor of Art, appointment
of two trustees to the long range
planning committee, and faculty
cuts.

Turner’s interview for the
presidency, Conducted in early
November 1974, was completed
With little student contact, Turner
commented. His exposure to
students was limited almost one
tirely to student government
leaders John Hansen, Peter
Reiner, and Terri Yasdick. While
Turner noted this fault in the
selection process, he quipped that
the process wouldn’t be necessary
again for a while.

Turner plans to teach an art
course once a week at night
beginning next semester if time
permits. He was adamant in his
desire to continue teaching as long
as possible.

“People don’t have fun here.”
Turner worriedly observed. The
psychology of the students and
faculty are partially responsible
for this phenomenon, Turner
decided, partially because
everyone is so concerned with
excellence. Part of this at-
mosphere is attributable to
curricular formats that stifle fun
academically.

In this respect, Turner cited his
biggest preoccupation as the
traditional departmental and
major classifications to which the
College is rooted. interdisciplinary
courses and majors would be
favorable to Turner for putting an
element of pleasure into
academics ,

Turner felt mat faculty members
should avoid sponsoring in-
dependents falling out of their

fields of expertise and called for a
generally strict policy on the
granting of the independent
courses of study. He was reluctant,
however. to make specific com-
ment to the Grinnell situation
because of his lack of familiarity
with the situation.

Practicum credits received little
favor from Turner, especially in
the department of athletics. Credit
for varsity sports was labeled
“appalling" and “ridiculous" by
Turner.

Clarifying his position on sports,
Turner adamently affirmed
support of all college athletics “100
per cent." Sport, he added, is a
useful device for diversifying the
applicant pool and preventing an
overly homogeneous student
body. His general term for sports
was ”nice.”

A liberal arts education is
unique, Turner claimed, because
the environment forces a student to
deal with people. At a large
university, Turner explained, a
student could escape or ignore a
problem or group easily enough. At
Grinnell, most likely, the problem
or group would likely stare at the
student over breakfast every
morning, Turner surmised.

“Are people as unhappy here as
l’m told?” Tllrner asked. When
students sing him the Grinnell
blues, he said, he responds by
asking them “if they are really
living this thing or just serving
time to go on to something else."
Loneliness on campus has been
brought up to Turner again and
again. It is an issue he believes
requires frank discussion. Ac-
cordingly he ended the formal
portion of the conference by
declaring that he had a “captive
audience" and posed this question:
“What‘s on your minds?”

During the less formal interview
session that followed, he stated
that he approved of some course
requirements, even though
Grinnell currently has none. He
was not specific as to how he would
like to see them implemented.
Turner criticized the offering of
“non-major” introductory courses,
encouraging students to take “the
real thing," or nothing at all.

Summarizing, Turner saw his
presidential duties as threefold.
First, as a faculty member, he
would like to remain active in
educational planning. Community
and state relations he saw as his
second major occupation, and,
finally, as a fund-raiser. In this
role he expects no problem, calling
himself a regular “ripoff artist."

Food
sessmn
grows

The first major symposmm ever
to link the food crisis directly with
American foreign policy will be
held on the Grinnell campus
February 1145 in Herrick chapel.
Distinguished policy makers and
authorities in the fields of govern
ment, foreign policy, international
economics, and agriculture' will
debate the issues of “Food,
Famine, and Foreign Policy."

The Food Conference, sponsored
as part of the Rosenfield lecture
series, promises to be the biggest
event at Grinnell in a long time.
Nearly 900 invitations have been
sent to Iowa»based organizations
and notables urging congressmen,
farmers' groups, the League of
Women Voters, high school social
studies teachers, and numerous
others to attend.

"In the logical progression of
global consideration of the
problem, after the Rome World
Food Conference, this is the second
big shot at it,” claims William
Deminoff, director of college"
relations, Grinnell plans to bring
the nation‘s influential planners to
the center of the breadbasket
where they will present a broad
spectrum of divergent views. Iowa
experts will add local perspective
to the difficult problems under
consideration.

Sci

Feb. 11-15

Intense executive branch
rivalries and farm opposition to
Earl Butz and his policies have
prevented the Department of
Agriculture from making a firm
committment to participate in the
symposium, as of this writing.
Previous encounters with former
State Department officials who are
scheduled to appear on the
Thursday evening panel were
distasteful and have added to the
Agriculture Department's
reluctance.

Planners hope the symposium
will “create as much awareness in
Iowa as possible of the food crisis
and its implications for U.S.
foreign policy,” according to H.
Wayne Moyer, chairman of the
conference, “allowing us to gain
new perspectives and insights as to
what Should and can be done.”
