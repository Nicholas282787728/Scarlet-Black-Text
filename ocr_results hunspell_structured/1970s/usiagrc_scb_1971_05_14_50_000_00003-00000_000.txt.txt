(continued from last week)
Many departments haveplan'
ned major revisions in their
course offerings fornext year,
and many of these changes
are in response to lheelimilr
ation of requirements passed
last semester.

Chemistry: Sciencel was
dropped this semester for
lack of interests but a new
nonemajoreoriented 100 level
course will be added next
semester. joseph Danforth,
chairman of the department,
said that "the course is net
specifically concerned with
teaching chemistry, but in-
volves people with problems
that have a chemical back
ground." The course will in-
volve a good deal of reading

Charges Begun

Much stir was caused about
campus this past week when
students noticed that there
will be a $100 charge for all
credits above 18 thata student
takes during a semester.

Because of the surprise and
confusion, Dean joseph Wall
issued a statement, saying, in
effect, that yes there wouldbe
a $100 surchargeinallcredits
over 18.

He explained that the college
is losing money because some
students are taking course
overloads in order to gradu-
are one 01‘ [W0 semesters
early.

He added that the new policy
is common practice in almost
all schools in the country and
that, until a few years ago, it

and lab work in which stud‘
ents do “ relevant experimen-
ts," probably along the lines
of effects of chemicals in en-
vironments. 'lne course will
emphasize obtaining data and
correlating it to find what it
means.

Political Science: The change
in the name of the introduc-
tory course, to “PoliticalSta-
bllity and Change: an lnlroducr
tion to Political Science" re-
flects a change in course con-
tent that took place this gem,
ester, department chairman
Neal Milner said.

The major changes in course
offerings will be second semi

special topics courses, inclu-
ding political psychology, stu-

For Overloads‘

was also the policy here.

The“ following figures from
the Registrar's office give an
idea of the impact of the new
policy: ‘

15 students took overloads
first semester this year; of
those, two took 19 credits,’
twelve took 20 credits, and'
one took 22 credits. 1

30 students took overloads:
second semester; ofthose, ten,
took 19 credits, 18 took 20
credits, and two took 22 cre-E
tilts.

If the college had instituted
the policy for this year, it.
would have collected $8,400
from these students; $400 ea ch‘
from those taking 22 credits
to $100 each from thosetaklng
19 credits.

dy of elections, Amerimn
Foreign Policy, and political
anthropology. The major ch-
ange for next semester will
be a comparativepolitics Cour
rse team taught by Grey and
Magce, comparing three dif-
ferent countries.

History: The department f»
fers several new courses xt
year. History 102, "Atlahtic
Revolutions," will bea second
semester alternative to the
major requirement History
101. A comparative history
course, it deals with revolu-
tionary movements in West-
ern Europe and the Americas
from the late eighteenth to
early nineteenth century.

Atlantic revolutions should
particularly appeal to advane
ced placement freshmen who
may have alreadyhada course
similar to the more general
101. It is also aimedatsophm
mores who decide to major in
history after having upper
level courses and therefore
prefer a more intensive
course than 101. ‘

An entirely new offering will
be the advanced topic in Ft-
ench history. Advanced topics
are similar to the old former
group independents, so 'the
exact shape of the Frenchhis-
tory offering will be deter—
mined next year by professor
and students. A two~semester
sequence of Latin American
history will be taught bya new
member of the Spanish depart-
ment who has been hired as a
kind of Latin American studies
expert.

ity' and "Social Psychology
of Modern Society of Modern
Society" have been renume

bored (to the 100 level), and;

they will both serve as pose
sible substitutes to the intro
course. Department chairman
Benny Nefzger said the chair
ges, which reflected the broad
introduction to the discipline
already providedby those cou-
rses, were made to provide
students with multiple possi-
ble entries to the major. Also,
the topics in sociological an-
alysis courses may, when they
concern broadtopics, serve
as an introduction to the de-
partment. These changes are
designed to open up the first
level of sociology courses to
more people.

French: Chairman of the
department Victor Verrette
said five new courses will be
offered next year. A new
100‘level course, "Introducr
tion to General Linguistics,"
is designed for interested st-
udents and: those who need
some knowledge of linguistics
in their own fields; it has no
prerequisite.

Two new courses will be of
fered at the 200 level to allow
for more tracking and stud‘
ent choice. Among the cour-
ses to be offered is “Special
Topics," in which a specific
author, movement, or theme
will be studied each semes-
ter. The special topic next
semester will be Camus, lau-
ght by Verrette. Two new
300 level courses are also
planned. Verrette indicated
that stﬁdent inputs were in»
fluential in determining cour-
se offerings in his department
for next year. ‘ ‘

American Studies: Actual
course ’offerings‘ will
change greatly next year. The
new department member w'll
teach a seminar in Afro-
American Studies the topic of
which has not yet been decle
ded.

Requirements for majors
have been slightly altered; A
course at or above the 200
level inanother culture is re
q‘uired to ' prevent 'students
from looking atAmerican cul-
ture in a vacuum. Thenew re
quirement comes of dropping
humanities and historicalstu-
dies, which previously in-
sured some exposure to for-
eign cultures.

Senior comprehensives have
been replaced by the senior
thesis: an analysis of Ameri-
can culture through the study
of a theme suggested by the
department. The thesis willbe
a ‘kind of independent workfor
which students receive four
credits.

Anthropology: The depart-
ment will present great cha'ne
ges. Several new courses are
being offered - notably the
special topics in such areas
as ethnology of West Africa,
urban anthropology, and many
others. These courses maybe
taken for either 2 or4 credits.
They will function as a kind of
group independent, combining
general lectures with individ-
ualized readings. This allows
the department greater diver
sity both in curriculum sub-
stance and style.

The traditional core offering
of anthropology courses will
also be SupplemEntedbypracr
tica involving student partici-
pation. An experimentalarch-
aeology practicum will con-
sistof constructing and exca-
vating simulated archaeo»
lo‘gi‘ml sites near campus.
Two new courses, “Evolur
tibn of Man and his Culture”
and "Introduction to Social
and Cultural Anthropology,"

- i l ,

* Departmental Course Offerings Revised

have been designed as over-
views of the discipline to in
troduce freshmen and pros-
pective sophomore majors to
the discipline. The courses
will be required ofmajorsand
include large lecture ses-
sions, discussion groups, lab
work, and films.

Two seminars have always
been required for majors.
Next year the junior seminar,
dealing with theory and re-
search methodology, will be
open to non-majors. The sen-
ior seminar, basimlly an in-
dependent‘project, consists of
original research and analy<
sis.ilt is open to majors only.

The Communications De~
partment, which will enter its
second full year neXt fall, is
still taking shape. Two new
workshops, one in expository
writing and another in oral
communications, have been
organized to replace two pre~
vious programs.

The Expository Writing
Workshop, 3 one or two credit
project, is aimed at perfect-
ing basic expository skills. It
will replace the Writers Lab-
oratory previously offered to
freshmen only. The newworke
shop will be open to students
at all levels.

Along the same lines, the
Oral Communimtiohs Workr
shop is designed to teach the
student basic oral presenta~
tion skills. It will focus on the
different kinds of speeches
and a discussion of the ele-
ments which make each type
effective.

A new course entitled "In-
terpersonal Communica-

is a revamping of the

current Communications 1.
The title change corresponds
to a_ s ’ft ‘ emphasis to the
differen facets of oral com—
munications lncludingpsycho-
logical and developmental efe
fects. The "public speaking"
aspect of the Communications
1 course will be covered more
specifically in the Oral Cour
munications Workshop.

Spanish: The Spanish depart-
ment, under the chairmanship
of Miss Beth Noble, is revisr
ing the great majority of its
courses next year. Miss Noble
said that, since the lifting of
requirements, her department
has gained more latitude and
freedom to design a CUII‘icur
lum. No distinction is made
between reading and oral
work, and a balance is sought
between Spanish and latin
American course material.

Miss Noble said that the
changes were made with a
great deal of consultation and
help from majors. The intro-
ductory Spanish course, 103,
will be mught on two differ
ent plans; one allows for more
in-class work and meetings
with the instructor, while the
other is geared to more out-
side work. Many courses dea-
ling with culture and conteme
porary thought have been
added, as well as three 200-
level courses open to none
majors without a Spanish
background: “The Latin Am-
erican Mind and Society,"
"Latin Ameriain History to
1825", and “Latin American
History since 1825."

Classics: William McKibben,
department chairman, said
that the courses numbered287
and 288 are the chief innova—
tions in the classics curricu‘
lum designed to appeal to non
majors. These two credit cow
rses will involve reading and
literary studies in translation
of material in regular classics
courses.
