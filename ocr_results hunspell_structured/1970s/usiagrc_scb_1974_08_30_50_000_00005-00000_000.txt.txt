Resignation signals change

by Dave Schechtei-

What is the historical
significance of the resignation of
Richard M, Nixon in relation to
several events that have taken
place within recent memory? For
your parents the moment or event
was learning of the attack on Pearl
Harbor in 1941. For the younger
generation it was the triple
assasinations of John F. Kennedy,
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and
Robert F. Kennedy. The
resignation did not have the shock
value of the above; the American
people were expecting it.

The Resignation

The resignation of the 37th

Grinnell offers new sights

by Anne Dcminol‘f

Walking around the downtown
Grinnell area, i noticed many
changes which took place during
the summer. The most noticeable
change was the absence of the
Colonial Theater on the corner of
Fifth and Main.

Originally built for stage per-
formances, the theater began its
transition into a movie house
during the Depression, The movie
house went out oi business in 1560,
leaving the building virtually idle
for twelve years. In 1972 Grinnell
College acquired the theater.

Due to serious cracks in the
foundation of the building, the
college granted a contract for
demolition of the theater to
Crawford’s Tree Service.
Demolition began in April.

Gary Cooper

The Colonial Theater was the site
of many interesting, and some
famous, events. John Phillip
Sousa’s band played there, and as
a member of the Grinnell College
Dramatic club, Gary Cooper made
his acting debut in a minor role at
the Colonial Theater,

Two of Grinnell’s banks are
experiencing or have experienced
marked structural changes. As_l
approached the Poweshiek
National Bank, 1 found that three
buildings directly north of the bank
had been torn down. A partially
enclosed wooden walkway had
been erected to enable passersby
to skirt the rubble and the con
struction work which is going on,

The Poweshiek hank plans to
erect a two-story building on the
lots where the former Iowa
Southern Utilities, the old Gifts
International, and the Wilcox-
Garland buildings stood

According to bank officials, the
architecture of the new building
will harmonize with that of the
original Louis Sullivan building
which will remain standing.

New Facade

The Grinncll State Bank has put
up a new facade of white brick. The
bank also added a section in the
back, across from Rick‘s Bike
Shop.

Weary of gazing at bank
buildings, I sought out Dean‘s
Sandwich Shop for a bite to eat. In

addition to selling pastrami,
corned beef, and hot ham sand-
wiches; the shop also specializes in
making its own doughnuts and
assorted pastries.

A large Coast to Coast hardware
store has occupied the building on
Broad where Chevrolet used to
reside Under new management,
Book ‘n’ Card on Main has become
Wood, Wax ‘n’ Paper. I also
noticeda profusion of “Jim Leach:
Honest” stickers decorating signs
and lamp poles downtown. Jim
Leach is a Republican running
against Ed Mezvinsky for the First
District’s seat in thc U.S.
Congress,

Finally, 1 became aware of a few
intangible changes in Grinnell, 1
narrowly escaped being run down
by a car turning “right on red.“
The new law, that cars may turn
right after stopping at a red light,
now applies to most intersections
in the state, At McNally's I found
out that there is no longer a tax on
food which is not prepared. And,
alas. there is no longer a nickel
coke at-Cunningham's. ,

president of the United States was
a reaffirmation of the American
government and the Constitutional
processes. While it may have
seemed to many a sad occasion,
there are several reasons to
consider it an almost joyous oer
casion, not one that should be
celebrated but one to be respected
and revered, Regardless of one‘s
feelings about the matter, Richard
Nixon, history buff. surely has
earned his spot in the annals.
Defenders of the former
president and critics oi his
“enemies" will claim that the
Nixon administration did no more
wrong than any other ad-
ministrationithe sin was getting
caught it would be a lie to say that
other administrations were clean,
Still, never has the breadth and
stench of corruption reached so
far, ruined so many, out such a
stink on government, seen
America so divided, or strained the
Constitutional processes.

Tiicllousc
Anyone who watched the
televised hearings of the House
Judiciary Committee had to be
impressed as they watched the
cogs of government turning.
Congress has received much of the
blame for what has gone wrong in
this country as the balance-of-
power shifted from Capitol Hill to
the White House. By conducting
themselves in an orderly and
dignified manner throughout the
proceedings, by carrying on a truly
impressive debate on an extremely
sensitive issue to all Americans,
Peter Rodillo and John Huts
chinson. along with their fellow
committee members succeeded in
putting the Congressional image
back onto the right track.
Richard Milhous Nixon, tearful
family at his side, resigned in the
spirit he conducted his office;
doing what he though was best for

the country. His failure to conduct
his office in accordance with the
Consitution forced him out of of-
fice. it was not the press that
ousted Nixon. the news media
simply reported the day to day
events as the story unfolded. it was
an honest and straightforward
attempt to report a story where the
stink of the events often made the
Dress the villian.

Foi-dasPresideiit

We now have Gerald Ford,
former Alermerican football
player, as the captain oi a ship
which needs desperately to
balance its load and float again.
Mr. Ford may have ended his
announced honeymoon with his
former colleagues in Congress by
singaling his plan to curb inflation.
He wishes to cut budget spending,
an admirable aim. But, he has
indicated that the cuts will conic
from programs such as those of
Health, Education, and Welfare
rather than from the already
bloated detense department
budget He has already expressed
his dismay, while signing an
education bill he thought to be
inflationary.

Theruture

Still, Mr. Ford has gotten off on a
better foot than his predecessor by
being as candid as possible with
the public. Only time will tell if the
American people will remain
awake and aware of their govern-
ment, or if they will slip back into
their pre-Watergate state oi in-
difference.

The Constitutional process of
impeachment was put to its first
major test in over 100 years, and
was round to be in good working
order From this many new faces
have arisen, and it is these pcople
who will become the vanguard of a
national movement to return
government tor the people and by
the people, to the people.
