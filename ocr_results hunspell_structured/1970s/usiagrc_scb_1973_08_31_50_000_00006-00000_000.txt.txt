PAGE 6 THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK AUGUST 31, 1973

Grinnelllixperiente Simulated

by Ken Winokur

The first Freshman simulation
game, using freshmen guinea'pigs,
ended last week, and now is the
time to access the project. in the
long run, there is no way to mea-
sure the contribution that it made
in helping to orient new ireshmen
and to prevent some of the annual
orientation problems. ‘There are, of
course, some indications that will
aid in the final determination.

‘ First, a brief Summary of how the
game was played. The theorybehind
the game is that freshmen would be
given a group oi possible activities
to be performed and questions to
be answered Within a 50 minute pe-
riod. The activities and questions
are supposed to represent various
situations encountered in Grinnell
life. The fifty minutes is insuifi
cient to accomplish all activities,
and participants are iorced to de-
cide which will be given priority.
Beiore the game is played, stu»
dents are required to set goals as
to how many points they antici—
pate they will score in the four
categories: Academic, Social, Car
greer, and Politics. Activities such
as asking a stranger to dance and

A rumor circulating on the College
campus that the arrest of Gates is
part oi a wider investigation into
drug use is false according to Pe-
'ters,

Asked to comment on whether the
rumor was true, Peters simplysaid,

humming the music, or going to the
library and taking notes train a psyr
chology text are given points. Anr
swers to questions about drugs and
sex were given points iitheyshowed
rational consideration and not blind
obedience to advice or doctrine.

Aiter the game was played dis»
cussions were held concerning the
questions and activities and about
the game itseli According to Res-
ident Advisor Sam Withers, initiator
oi the program at Grinnell, these
discussions are the “key to the
game. The game has very little
value without discussion,”

The goals oi the program are many
told. One oi the major rationals
tor the game is that it helps intro-
duce ireshmen to one another and
provides a common experience for
discussion. According to withers,
the problem oi making iriends as
a ireshman causes a great deal
oi anxiety, Presumably, this goal
has been iuliilled. Interaction be
tween students during the game was
great, and it can be assumed that
this interaction has helped familiar
rize new students with others on
campus.

only between September 1 and Sept

years back there may have been
some animosity between the so—
called town and gown but that’s all
past history that We can forget.”
He said that the student iniluence
has not been ielt that much in elec-
tions “There might be a slight bit
oi iniluence, but We really haven’t
ielt the iull brunt oi student voting
There’s been only one city election
since students have been eligible
to vote and the impact oi their vot-
ing in that election was yust not
that great.”

Dr. Beaver said that he ieels the
political activities oi the college
students is necessary, “It’s good
in all wayS,” the mayor explained
”Those doing the workdevelop more
interest in an election or whatever
and it generates thought in the
people who are contacted,” he cone
cluded.

A second major rational tor the
game was to get ireshmen to lace
and consider the problems they are
likely to encounter During the dis-
cussions period student advisors
prompted participants to express
their views on the subjects involved
in the game. But, according to
Withers, “There was something mi-
ssing. The game would have had
more value ii the discussions had
been better.”

At the end oi the discussions, stu-
dents were asked to evaluate the
game, Most oi the evaluations indi—
cated that the participants tell that
the game was worthwhile, But, ace
cording to Withers, they did not
seem sure in what way they bener
tiled,

A iinal decision oi the program is

ive discussion is crippled. A game
aimed at relevant issues can easily
iall short and “turn oft”arelevance-
weary ireshman class. Do thebene-

tion line, It is unfortunate thatl
cannot be as coniident about my
teachers (or the buildings on cam-
pus).

Imagine storlng your possessions
at a proiessor's house in the sp-
ring and returning in the ,fall to
discover that he is now sojourn»
ing in San Diego. Scratch the need
for imagination; lt happened, Nothing
stays hypothetical ior very long at
Grinnell College,

I admit that there are many Iac~
ulty members who make careers
out of the fields of Grinnell. I know
students who are making careers
out of Grinnell. But the facts seem
to indicate that according to the
precepts of survival of the fittest,
the students are outlastlng their
mentors,

The scenario is- painful enough
without the faculty ironically bring-
ing it up by claiming that the op-
posite is true.

Now that the rules for the bout
have been clarified, will the lac-
ulty and the student government
shake hands and come out squabbr

ln facultyrrelated concerns we are
presently involved in two areas,
course syllabi for this tall's course

The lowa Student public interest
Research Group (ISPIRG) oi Grin—
nell College has asked us to iniorm
students that there will be a group
