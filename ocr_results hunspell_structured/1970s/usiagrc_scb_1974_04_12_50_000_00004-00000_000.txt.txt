Dear Mr. Solzhenitsyn:

Thus began the salutation whereupon Grinnell College
as an institution proferred the Russian dissident an
honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters "to honor
your great human and literary accomplishments."

It appears to us that this offer is inappropriate, as one
condition for conferral of the honorary degree is that
Solzhenitsyn would have to be present at commencement
exercises to be held on Grinnell campus May 29, 1974.
What we have offeredSolzhenitsynisagesture of Western
liberalism only to have him tell us that democracy is

in its "last decline" a system of "parties and social‘

classes engaged in a conflict of interests just interests,
nothing higher." ‘

The college's attitude on honorary degrees is that
“each degree granted should accomplish some objec-
tive for the benefit of the college.” The objective in
offering a degree to Solzhenitsyn seems obscure and
more a case of‘ Grinnell ”me-tooism", offering to
hood or hound the author in the academic regalia of
Grinnell.

We are not alone, but in the illustrious company of
Yale, the Iowa‘ Writer’s Workshop, other schools and
organization including probably even the Harper Valley
PTA. Our offer takes the appearance of being self
serving with little recognition of Solzhenitsyn as a man,
but as a public representation which we have chosen to
acknowledge.

Solzhenitsyn is not the libertariah democrat that we
thought would run into the armsand embrace the Western
academic world if not our political institutions. He would
not leave the Soviet Union to accept a Nobel Prize for
Literature and finally left only after being exiled. Why
should we expect him to come to Grinnell?

The belief that Solzhenitsyn is desirous of Western
recognition tends to color our comprehension of the
man. Robert Frost writing in “The Death of the Hired
Hand" makes the observation -- ”Home is the place

‘where when you have to go there, they have to take you
in." This is the striking poignancy in the recent exile
of the Russian author, in that for him this is no longer
possible.

This is something that no number of academic degrees
can obtain for him, Unless Grinnell can return him to
his country it has little, to offer.

Good. Health!

Communications arts seem to be enjoying a regeneration at
Grinnell and we. as communicators, are delighted.

Monday‘s Grinnell Communications Conference drew student
writers and broadcasters from a tworstate, and packed Grinnell
House with both visitors and Grinnellians.

‘Monday evening's public discussion of media responsibility drew
more than one hundred people to South Lounge for more than two
hours of give and take.

The audience questions showed \ considerable interest in
communications, as a discipline, as a profession, and as an art.

An interdisciplinary program in communications, to replace the
now disbanded Department of Communications, has hit a temporary
snag -- lack of funds.

But President Glenn Leggett promised earlier this year that next
year‘s communications program would be as good or better than any
program the College has ever had.

He is making sincere efforts to raise money to fund the program,
and the show of interest at Monday's conference should make his
task considerably easier.

Jobs are hard to find in any field, and especially so in
communications industries. But, many of those showing interest in
communications arts realize that, no matter what field or profession
they enter later in life, their experience now, learning to
communicate ideas to those around them, will prove invaluable.

There are still those who are leaving Grinnell to seek more
complete programs elsewhere. But, there are also those who. seeing
the growth of communications and the promise it could hold, are
willing to chance another year at Grinnell,

That is perhaps the most important point of all. Grinnell, if it
remains committed to keeping its communications program in good
health, can offer the unique combination of a superb liberal arts
environment coupled with the communications curriculum needed
to train those interested in entering the field at a later date.

Communications executives are emphasizing the importance of a
broad background in getting and keeping a job in the field. Grinnell
appears to be on the road to meeting the challenge of providing this
background.

Grinnell can take one further step to improve the health of the
communications program. A proposal is now being formulated to
grant practicum credit for consistent work on student publications
and radio. *

The theory behind such credit is the same as that behind practicum
for music or theatre ~ that the work being performed, while not the
same as the work done for a standard course. is both demanding and
rewarding It contributes to the educational process. and this
contribution should be acknowledged

To the Ediiol‘s:

I would like to correct fhe mis-
impressions and false information
conveyed by your editorial, “The
invalid Box," which discussed the
invalidation of Ihe two SGA vice
presidential elections. As chairman
of the Student Elections Board Iwas
surprised (although knowing the 8&5
I should not have been) that lhe 3&5
did not care enough about accuracy
to contact me before writing an ed,
ilorial describing the vice-presi»
dential elections.

The reason two elections had to be
held was that in the firs! election,
because of a misunderstanding and
the failure of a certain SGA offl»
cer to show up to work al ihe el-
ectioll table, the ballot box was
left unattended for 45 minutes (not
over an hour as staled in the ed—
itorial), When this was discovered,
the only alternative was to cancel
the election. All involved wanted to
have an election that would be une
questionahly fair.

iohu Hansen, our new SGA pre-
sident, that afternoon informed me
that he would handle all details of
second election. It was he and not
the Elections Board who conducted
Tuesday's election. The omission
of this fad by the editors can only
be blamed on their negligence.

The reason the 5&3 knew before
me who the candidates were was
that Scott Wail had placed a notice
in the memo requesting that any
person wishing to run for viceeprv
esident should contact him, and not
myself. I assumed that when Weil
told me that he had put the notice
in the memo, that the candidates
would contact the Election Board.
But because they contacted Weil,
and because I was unable to reach
him until the day after nominations
closed, the 58:13 was able to inform
me of the names of the candidates
a whole twelve hours before [was
able to ialk it) Well.

Scott Weil was contacted in the Pub
by a girl who wanted to run for
vice-president because he, and not
myself, had arranged that persons

This week‘s column is an apology.
For years i have been against pets,
especially dogs, on this campus. l
have just realized the irrationality
of such a position. Perhaps my po»
sitibn was born of ignorance, but
I fear stupidity and selfishness had
a great deal more to do with it.
But when I read the results of last
week's dog referendum and discov-
ered howfewothers among my peers
are as averse to dog excrement,
dog packs and dog fights as I am
my eyes were opened. i realized
that if ever i was going to grow up

dish selfishness of mine. Therefdre

You may laugh at this and think it .

desiring to be candidates talk to
him, When I called him he could
not remember who she was (if must
have been a rough night at the Pub).
This is why when talking to the SKLB
about something else I was given
this candidates name.

Next, the reason the name of a
candidate, Charlie Nash, was not
included in the ShB's candidate
profiles was because Nash infor—
med me on Thursday night follow—
ing the closing of nominations that
he wanted to be a candidate. when
I informed Nash that it was too
late to put his name into nominav
tion he said that he had told Scott
Weil two weeks before that he wall-
ted to run for viceepresidenl. This
is a fact Weil never meniioned to
me or anyone else on the Elections
Board. I would have immediately
called the 5115 so they could write
a profile on Nash for Friday’s ed-
ition, except that I had been pre-
viously ‘lold by the sun’s manag—
ing editor that it was too late and
that the paper had already gone to
press. This information turned out
to be wrong and John Wylieinformed
me that changes could Still have been
made in the paper up to Friday mar
rning. This is something Iwould
naturally assume lhe managing Edie
tor to know. (But again, it should
not have surprised me.)

The editorial goes on to say that
the SALE never got any confirma-
tion that Nash was a candidale. I
confirmed this when I Called the
SM! later and Scott Weil also con-
firmed this. How much more con-
firmation do the editors want?

I realize now firsthand the jusli»
fichtion for the continuing accusa»
lions against the S318 and its edi-
tors for their constant inaccura»
cies, their failure to check facts,
and their sheer incompetence in
reporting the news. It is obvious
that before writing this editorial
the editors did not feel it impor-
tant enough to contact any Hi the pe-
ople involved in the election. While
it c‘ould be a viable source of news
to the campus community, the S518.

some type of weird parody, but it’s
not. I‘ve talked to Nina Adams and
she said my cow would be perfectly
legal as long as i bought her pet
tags. Now i go ill for legality as
much as anybody, but why should
I waste perfectly good loddermouey
on a pet tag. Who will do anything
if I don’t? I really should like to
see Sandy Rikkoon take my cowany—
where. Since there’s no dogcatcher
in Grinnell City to call I imagine
there are no cowcalchers (excepton
the MkStL, ho ho ho) in iowneither.

I responded that I thought animals

potential for self-determination and
self~goverllance As for her other
functions I should think the college

r Stein: Says Election Editorial Unclear, Unfair

because of writing like this and its
general ineptness, has reduced it,
self to a naive observer of this
campus. The 5545’: editors, in al~
tempting to point out the income
patches of the Election Board, sere
ved only by their editorial to point
out their own incompetence.

Sincerely,

David Stein

Huber, Genereaux:
Correction

To the Editors:

We would like to correct an err—
oneous impression created by John
Turnhull's article in last weeks ShB.

The Office of College Relations is
not involved with the publication of
the faculty evaluation. Furthermore
the Office of College Services and
specifically the Service Bureau has
been very ell-operative in helping
us meet out publication deadline.

In the future we would ask that the
5&8 check its facts, this story
was not cleared with either of us.

The problem here lies not with the
Service Bureau but with our own
inability to attract a large number
of students in help us in writing
and producing the handbook by pre-
registration.

The Institutional Grapevine will be
on sale in the Post Office on
Wednesday. April 17 and Thursday,
April 18.

How will Heed her? In spring and
fall 1 intend in gmp her on cen-

will graze less and I’ll rip-off

even this may not be enough to sus-

I have a righl to a pet. I will get
a pet, but I don’t want a cat nor
a dog nor even a boa constrictor,
i want a cow and saying that peo-
ple who want dogs or cats or boa
constrictors can have one or two
whether they can afford to support
them‘ or not and that I who only
want one little cow Can’t have her,
is arbitrary,discriminatoryandzb-

a right to my pet and those who
wish to restrict me have none. So
