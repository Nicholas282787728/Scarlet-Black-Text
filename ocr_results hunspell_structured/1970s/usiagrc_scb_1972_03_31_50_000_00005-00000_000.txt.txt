Muskie Runs Around Neighborhood To Harrisburg We Go

by Mark Sableman

Election even for the Florida prim
mary two and hall weeks ago could
have been confused with an aviation
contest. Eleven candidates were ens
tered in the Democratic presidential
primary, and aii but two oithe seven
major contenders were ﬂying to
three or more cities lor campaign
appearances.

It was an idcal situation for a
vacationing sop reporter to get a
close look at an election campaign,
at a primary which would be the
iirst at many major turning points
In the 1972 campaign. It would,
or should be, a preview of the Wis-
consin primary now less than a week
away,

This reporter chose to follow Sen-
ator Edmund Muskie, the Democra-
tic frontrunner, atone ofthree public
appearances in Florida that day, The
three cities on Muskie’s ﬂight plan"
Orlando, Clearwater, and Miami,
represented the three “hot spots" or
major urban areas that the Senator
was cultivating votes inﬂaccording
to three astute and experienced
political observers, the CBS camera
and reporting crew which had been
lollowing Muskie since New Hamp-

swim

In Orlando in the morning, Muskie
spoke to a group of elderly ladies
at a condominium, and urged com-
petition (thus, lower prices) in pre-
scription drugs. It was one of the
Iew actual legislative proposals
made in the primary campaign by
anyone other than George Wallace.
One new idea a day must he cons
sidered the maximum in politics,
and for the Clearwater visit, the
candidate’s Staff planned a more
traditional door-tD-dDDr vlsltlng
with voters, in the upper middle
class neighborhood of Morningside
Heights.

Russell Kelly, a Muskie campaign
worker who lived in the neighbor
hood, knew his neighbors, and was
able to carefully lead the Senator
from one house to another, Skips
ping a lew here and there, so that
Muskie would always be greeted by

a friendly, Democratic, pangs-suited .

housewlle.’

Sometimes the candidate and the
voter only exchanged pleasantries.
But at several homes, the house-
wives (already primed for the visit
through mailings, telephone calls,
and word at mouth) spurted out
questions for the candidate even
belore Kelly was able to introduce
Muskie and have a Polaroid picture
shot.

One woman told Muskie that she had
read that the water pollution control
bill has gone to the House, and is
weaker there than in the Senate.

“Yes,” Senator Muskie replied,
“...the President is trying to water
it down. Write your congressman
about it."

“That’s exactly what I plan to do.”

Muskie’s pun brought a smile, but
did not definitely persuade her to
Vote for him. She was still undecided
when asked whom she would vote
for, although of the seven people
questioned by this reporter, she was
the only one to take the liberal stand
on the busing straw vote that was on
the primary ballot.

Another housewife, Mrs. Robert
Randolph, asked the candidate what
he would do about the Vietnam war
if elected.

"End it,” Muskie said. “It stands
between us and our future in this
country....l don’t want to be selfr
righteous, i haven't always been
this way, but I‘ve come around to
this position I’d end our activity
and bring them home, conditioned
only on release olprisoners oiwar."

was Mrs. Randolph impressed,
reporters asked? ”I'm still un—
decided .i like him better than a
lot of the others, more than Hum»
phi-ey.“ But, she said, the waris
not the most important issue in the
campaign for herr»there were many
other issues.

Muskie’s ten minute speech to the
people ot Morningslde Estates, de-
livered on the spacious patio oi the
Kelly home to some 250 people, was
the candidate’s formal attempt to get
at some of those issues

It struck the theme that has been
repeated throughout the nation since
Muskle’s announcement ol candidacy
in January: “We need a sense of
community....We need new leader-
Ship.”

Those two lines were perhaps the
most direct and most specific state»
ments in the whole speech (which
was termed by my CBS informants
as short but typical). The rest of
the speech was worse in that it took
more words to say less.

“I think it’s time to come down to
the essential things, to the things
that need to be dons.| now to build
a whole and a wholesome state.

“We need a sense ol community,
like we have in my home state of
Maine....We need to feel a part of
it, to leel opportunity there, to reel
good schools there, to feel we can
get our fair share there, to feel
security in old age there...

”We've been asked ior too long to
protect those who have already made
it, to protect the special interests,
We've been taught all the lessons
of division. We can counter them
only it we bring ourselves as in,
dividuals to say that it's wrong"
in the voting booth tomorrow,”

Thus, anyone in the crowd 01250
who heard Muskie knew that he was
ten community, wholeness and
wholesomeness, opportunity, good
schools, and a host ofsimilar things,
and that he was against special in-
terests and divisiveness (and, not
so Incidentally, “that worn out dem-
ogogue who will never be Presir
denl'U-George Wallace).

Two Morningside residents had
more specific questions of what
Muskie was tor and against. and
they had confronted him earler as
he walked along the sidewalks,

Kathy Paulspn, a 16 year old vols
unteer at Muskie headquarters,
asked the Senator if he would le-
galize marijuana.

Muskie said that we definitely
should reduce penalties on users,
but that we still don't knew the ef-
feet: or long term use. The Sena-
tor had talked to some former drug
addicts only a few days earlier,
and they had told him that they had
gone lrom marijuana to heroin in
one and a half years.

OI course, Muskie said, we know
marijuana is not addictivenbut from
their experience, the addicts are
against it. Even so, that’s not the
last word, he said, and research is
still going on.

Kathy called the answer ”a run~
around.”

Clarence G. Richardson, a regiss
tered Democrat who admires and
plans to vote ior President Nixon,
asked Muskie if busing of school
Children Could be made ”not
forced ”

”I don't know what ‘not forced'
means," Muskie said, and he re-
mained unchanged in this even as
Mr, Richardson Went into more and
more specilic examples.

Muskie explained that the Maine
high schools employ busing and
consolidated school districts as a
remedy lor the poor education {err
merly given in schools in very small
communities where often there
would be only one student in a grade
uating class. This busing was vole
untary, in that the people voted lor
consolidation, but involuntary in that
everyone had to participate, even
while some disliked it.

The distinction between voluntary
and involuntary busing is not the
basic one, Muskie told Mr. Richard-
son; what is important is that the
school System be set up inaway that
all will get a good education, and that
the necessry tools, like busins, be
“applied With common sense.”

Richardson would have called Mus-
kie’s answer a "runéirollnd.’Y

Two questions lrom citizens, two

“runarounds” for answers; [5 Mus-
kie the runal‘ound candidate? Con-
sidering his whole campaign in Flor-
ida, marked in many ways by an
unwillingness to take strong stands,
to even Iollow other candidates'
leads in revealing campaign contribr
utors, or to take more than “A New
Beginning” or “A New Community”
as the theme for his campaign,
Muskie WAS a runaround candidate.

A Daniel Yankelovich Survey con-
ducted for the "New York Times,”
which Employed the method ofinter-
viewing people alter they have voted,
lound that only onerthlrd at those
voting ior Muskie strongly agreed
with his positions on issues,

Probably, it would be more correct
that the voters didn't “know” Mus—
kie’s positions. Even Kathy Paulson
and Clarence Richardson, who
pressed Muskie on issues where he
had a position, could be uncertain as
to what the position was.

Muskie knows this now, and he and
his campaign stall have said that
they are changing to a more forceful
presentation of the candidate's views
in the campaign for next week's Wis-
consin primary.

The old strategy wasn’t a total
lailure. though. Muskie lost the pri-
mary overall, but he doubled his
staterwide percentage in Pinellas
County, one of the state’s largest
urban areas, encompassing St. Pe—
tersburg and Clearwaler.

And he carried three Pinnelas
County preclnts; one was the Mornr
ingside neighborhood where the Senr
ator had met citizens, answered (in
some way) their questions, asked to
be the one to lead them to "a whole
and a wholesome society“, and told
a reporter {or a college paper in
lar-oll lowa that “anything but the
present system of campaigning in
primaries would be more sinsible
than this.”

YR’s Meet;

by Linnet Harlan

“We Are 50 Pilgrims From
Chicago...” announced the leaﬂets
that we handed toll collectors as
our eightrcar caravan made its way
from Chicago to South Bend and
Fort Wayne, Indiana, Toledo, Clever
land, and Warren, Ohio, and State
College, Pennsylvania, lor the tri-
umphal entry into Harrisburg on
Palm Sunday.

The pilgrimage began as a show
oi support {or the Harrisburg 7, a
group (including Fr Phil Berrigan
and Eqbal Ahmad, a Pakistanlscho-
lar who spoke at Grinnell last April)
which is being tried, not on the
highly publicized charges at can»
spiracy to kidnap Henry Kissinger
and blow up the heating tunnels of
Washington, 1311., but on charges
that the individuals conspired to
destroy the Selective Service Sysr
tem. But as the pilgrimage progres-
sed, we lound that it was much more.

The actions oi the pilgrimage re-
emphaslzed the theme of the detail,
dants, most of whom are Catholics,
that “Now is the time to spiritualize
politics and radicalize religion."
The pilgrimage began Thursday,
April 23, in lront of Chicago's
lederal building with a guerrilla
theatre action which tied the “Wall
ol Injustice" tamed by Nixon, Mit-
chell, Hoover, Klelndienst, Kiss~
inger, Agnew, Laird, and Lynch
(chiel prosecutor in Harrisburg) to
the wall of Jericho, which in biblical
times crumbled as the pilgrims
persisted.

Alter leaving the lederal building
(where our actions were observed
by at least three members of Chi-
cago’s infamous “Red Squad" who
followed us all morning) we headed
for South Bend, Indiana. Following
a communal lunch with interested

And Attack Democrats

by‘c‘urtis'li. Gorrell

Assuming the disguide ol 2 "Young
Republicans”, Randy Baldas and I
represented the Grinnell contingent
of lnfiltrators at the Young Republi-
can Leadershlp Conference hosted
in Washington, D.C. March Bell.

The Republican Party paraded be-
for us, and paraded us belore, some
oi its most prominent ligures in a
series of workshops, receptions, and
banquets leaturing everything lrom
handshakes with Tricia to a Cold
Duck Party registering the conspic—
uous consumption at 1,400 bottles.

“Re-elect the President" was the
domlnzlnt theme; the Democratic
Party a prevalent target “Miami
is getting ready tor them," quipped
the notorious hack artist, Spiro T.,
”Holiday Inn has built a string of
log cabins, and the liieguards are
now receiving instructions on how to
rescue candidates who try to walk
on water.”

George McGovern drew fire lrom
many podiums (“Never opens his
mouth except to rearrage his feet”),
but turncoat John Linsay was the
favorite target oi Republican verbal
abuse, In another Agnew fairy tale
Ted Kennedy was to be lound in
Miami complaining about “woefully
inadequate lacilities...the only john
on my iloor is Lindsay.”

But beyond the jokes, the parties,
and the politicking, a number of
speakers actually addressed them—
selves to serious questions and
issues.

Senator Barry Goldwater, sells
depicted as a ”world’s expert on
split party,” spoke against a divi-
sion at conservative Republicans:
“I don't want to ever see the Repub—
lican Party go through what It did
in 1964 with 6 to 8 million mem-
bers deserting that party...and I
say to my conservative lriends
wrong, wrong, wrong!”

William D. Ruckelshaus, Admini-
strator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, presented a ses»
sion on “Protecting the Environ-
ment,” He praised Nixon's “Out-
standing record in environment" and
stated his belief that the EPA has
"laid the foundation” tor marked
improvement in the quality oi the

environment in the relatively near
Iuture. ’

George Romney, Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, hit
on a common theme with his opinion
that “it he didn’t do anything else”
Nixon should be termedasuccessiul
President because “he has put a
stop to legislative action by the
Supreme Court and he has put men
on the Supreme Court who recognize
that they’re judges."

China was on everyone's mind, and
the substance of Goldwater’s rec
marks was generally echoed by
speakers throughout the conference:
“I think the world has probably ace
quired a little better chance for
peace, a little better chance to open
up the communication lines between
the peoples of the world...l think it’s
better to talk than to go out and start
killing ”

There were even touches of philo-
sophy displayed here, as with Sen-
ator Bill Brock’s ”break with the
rules of the Senate and vote on my
convictions” and Governor Nelson
Rockefeller’s feeling (rasped out
every bit as well as David Fry’s
invitation) that "...ln the mechanis-
tic World that we live in...l think
the most important ingredient is
love ..a sense at understanding and
concern.”

At this point I have said much about
the speakers and programs at the
Republican conlerence, but as yeti
have not commented on whatwas, Ior
me, the most stunning aspect of this
symposium: the audience. Here
were over 1,000 young people greatly
enthused over the Republican Party,
its ideals. The evidence before my
eyes forced me to take a hard look
at Agnew’s rap that, contrary to
general media opinion, the alterna-
tives for youth aren't limited to
”Democrat, drop-out, and anar-
chist."

This conlerence was a plunge into
the pool of thought on the “other
side", to be valued not only for its
insight into the thinking of others,
but also for provoking reilection
and sell-introspection into what,
how, and why you believe the things
you do. It was, in short, challenging
and relreshing.

people in South Bend, we did another
guerrilla theatre action, the daily
death count. Mostotus weredressed
as Southeast Asians, wearing Coolie
hats and ”blood" soaked bandages.

Humming Chopin’s death march, we
marched towards the business area
of South Bend, preceded by"‘Uncle
Sam”, who smiled and joked with
passers-by, and by blackrrobed
Death. Suddenly “Uncle Sam” looked
at his watch and turned to Death,
saying “Twenty-four hours have
passed, another three hundred must
die as a result of U. S. bombing in
Southeast Asia.” Death swept his
arms across us, and screaming and
groaning, we ”died.”

After a few minutes of silence, we
each rose saying, “I am one of
three hundred people who died in
Southeast Asia today. U. S. bombs
killed me." Uncle Sam paid no
attention, and we moved on to cover
most of downtown South Bend.

When we finished the daily death
toll, we hurried back to the cars
and headed for the next stop, Fort
wayne, lndiana. Alter a warm rec
caption and communal dinner, we
showed the NARMIC slide presenta-
tion.

Prepared by the National Action
Research on the Military—Industrial
Complex, a branch at the American
Friends Service Committee, the
slides are an excellent and moving
documentation of the U. S. automated
battlefield; the anti-personnel wea-
pons we use; the intentional maim-
ing of Southeast Asians (maiming
individuals is preferred over killing
them by military officials because
it diverts “enemy” personnel to
care or the injured, and decreases
morale more); and how U. S. ill-
dustries are tied in with the destruc-
tion of Southeast Asia.

After the slide show, which stunned
those of us who saw it for the first
time, we discussed the Harrisburg
case. Then we joined in a peace
liturgy which Combined excerpts
from Dan and Phil Berrigan’s writs
ings, passages from the Bible, The
War Prayer ( a movingly-anti-war
poem by Mark Twain who would not
allow it to be published during his
lifetime because "it tells the whole
truth and only dead men tell the whole
truth”). and passages from The
Trial of the Calonsville Nine.

After the liturgy, we split into
small groups and spent the night in
the homes of Fort Wayne people.

The specifics oi the other stops
differ little from those at the first
day, but the details are very impure
tant.

In Toledo I was amazed at the num,
her 0! people, especially those my
own age, who reiused to even take a
leaflet as they stepped over our
“dead” bodies.

in Cleveland we were greeted with
the astounding news that the Harris-
burg defense had rested its case,
and I met briefly with Grinnell’s
Ted Glick who was indicted with the
Harrisburg Seven but will be tried
separately because he insists on
acting as his own lawyer.

In Warren we discussed our inl-
pressions oi the pilgrimage thus far.

And In State College my hosts had
invited ten friends over; so, we
discussed not only the war and the
case, but the lrustrations of being
powerless and at not knowing how to
approach the problem of getting
power.

Sunday morning we were on to
Harrisburg. Since we had been
joined by others on the way, we had
twelve cars when we pulled in on
Palm Sunday morning. The parade,
lor which we were joined by people
already in Harrisburg and other
pilgrims, had two parts -- death,
people In dark clothes and black
robes; and life __ people with wild
colorful costumes and banners.
“Choose life over death" has long
been a major theme of the
defendants, several of whom have
stated that they prefer the burning
oI paper to the burning or children.

Since many or us had to getbaok
for work or classes Monday, we
left almost immediately after the
rally that followed the parade. The
pilgrimage may have been short, but
it had an important impact on all of
us who participated.
