:Corner, Christy’ 3 add flavor options

by Janet Pope

Until this year, the Longhorn,
JD’s, and BJ‘s on special occasions,
have been the basic restaurant
choices in Grinnell. However, two
new restaurants appeared on the
scene over the summer. Though it
looks like the Longhorn will remain

Mhe basic all around place, The

Corner and Christys add in-
teresting options for an evening
meal. The Comer deals strictly in

Qgrill your own steaks while

Christy 3 serves seafoods, ham,
chicken, and beef.

Due to limited funds olboth the
son and this reporter, it was only

~ possible to check out the lood In

each restaurant on one night.
Upon entering The Corner at 6:30
on a Saturday night, my come
panion and l were rather surprised
to lind it devoid or customers.
(However, business did pick up as
the evening progressed.) Tom

onions in plastic containers, and, or
course, lettuce. We were allowed
as much as we liked,

The decor and atmosphere oi the
dining area in The Corner are
pretty zilch. it is quiet, which is one
of the restaurant‘s strong points
according to Loucks, He also
stressed that all the steaks were 16
ounces. “We are one of the few
places around that has good food at
reasonable prices," he said.

Just before we took the steaks off
we grilled some bread. It was
French bread out oI a plastic bag.
Along with steak and bread we had
baked potatoes with butter and
sour cream. The steak was ex
cellent, the sour cream was great,
and the bread was OK. Oh yeah,
the 7-Up was good. We paid extra
for drinks,

After dinner we checked out the
downstairs bar. This area Seemed
nicer than the upstairs though it

Cole and Sheryl Christy opened Christy’s Supper Club on July 15. it is a
small, traditional dinner place which has special all-you-can eat nights on

Friday and Sunday.

Loucks, manager and owner oi the
restaurant, explained that just
atter he opened last year business
was good ior about lour weeks.
Then things slowed down over the
summer. However, he expects
business to pick up again.

Alter paying so apiece tor the
meal, Loucks showed us the steaks
from which We were to choose our
dinner. After spearing our choices,

five put them on the grill and added

, salt and pepper. While our steaks

cooked we prepared and ate
salads. The salad bar was an in»
formal arrangement with
dressing, carrots, croutons, red
cabbage, parmesan cheese, and

may have been because it was
darker. l have heard reports that
the Corner’s mixed drinks are
good, though they are lacking ice
cream with which to make after
dinner drinks. Thus my pink
squirrel was pretty rotten as was
my companions grasshopper,
After leaving Tlle Corner we both
mentioned that we felt full and
relaxed. Loucks, who has not been
in the restaurant business before,
had been very hospitable. He said
that he hoped and expected to
receive business lrom the college
It was a good steak dinner.
However, when I pay ior my land, I
usually like something other than

steak and potatoes. So I doubt if I ll
be rrequenting The Corner very
often.

Cole and Sheryl Christy, who are
originally from Marshalltownv
opened Christy’s on July 15,
”We’ve worked (or several other
restaurants and we thought we
would manage one or our own.”
explained Sheryl Christy, Aer
cording toher. there was no special
reason (or her and her husband
settling in Grinnell She mentioned
that it was available, that there is a
limited supper Club Situation, and
that Grinnell is a nice-sized town.

Christy’s serves various dinners,
with Friday and Sunday night all-
you-can-eat specials. On Friday
ﬁsh is served and on Sunday the
diner can Choose between chicken,
ham, and Swedish meat balls.
Steaks range in price from $5.25 to
$7.95. A chicken dinner is $3.50, and
ham is $3.95. Shrimp costs $2.95,
scallops $3.50, oysters $175, and a
seafood platter is $7.65. Trout Costs
$4.25, lobster tails $9.25, and surf
and turf is $3.25

We dined at Christy’s on Sunday
night. Among the highlights of the
meal were blue cheese dressing (or
the salad and real butter [or
crackers and bread. My ham was
good though not great. My com-
panion ordered Chicken. I tried
some and it tasted quite good.
Potatoes, gravy, and mixed
vegetables were served lamily
style; the gravy was great and the
mixed vegetables tasted lantastic.
(I don't usually get on on mixed
vegetables, but these were good.)

Several times we were offered
more of everything. We did have
seconds though we did not test the
establishment to see how much
they would give us. On the whole,
the meal was excellent, cunr
sidering the money we paid lor
it.

Sheryl Christy explained that her
husband does all the cooking While
she manages the bar. She ex-
plained that the size of the place
makes it easy tor them to manage,

Unlike The Corner, Christy’s
offers a limited selection of
desserts. It also has a short bar
partially separated irom the dining
area, though we didn’t try it out.
The Christys have made an at»
tempt to lix up the dining room,
though it has no special at
mosphere. Sheryl Christy said that
they hadn t gotten much business
trom college students, though they
hoped to in the iuture.

Though the two newest Grinnell
eating spots will not provide our
palates with any wild, exciting new
adventures, they are worth a try.
Good steaks are to be had at The
Corner if you have $6. 0n the other
hand, it you just want to get away
Irom SAGA, cheaply, hit Christy’s
on an allryourcan-eat night.
