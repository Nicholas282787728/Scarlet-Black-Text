Community Day Is Tomorrow

Everything is in readyness
for tomorrow’s Community
Day, when studentsand towns-
people will help beautify the
town.

As of Tuesday night, about
eighty persons signed up to
help in the Community Day
projects. The purpose of the
day is to beautify the Grin—
nell community. Nancy Gra-
ham, head oftheproject, noted
that the women outnumbered
the men by three to one, and
she urgedallinterestedmen to
lend their services to the ef
fort.

The day certainly presents a

variety of work: eight dif-
ferent projects will be under
taken. Two lotswillbe cleaned
on South West Street. A side-
walk will be laid on Broad
Street in front of the Congrer
gationa! Church. At 1533 See
ond Ave., a porch and steps
will be repaired, and the house
will be painted. At 829 Park
the lot will be cleared,aporch
will be cemented, and the
house will be painted. At Un-
cle Sam's the stairs and siding
of the building will bepainted.
Two of the more unusual prov
jects include the construction
of a paper drop at the paper
warehouse, and the clearing

Foreign Students Almost Broke

The Foreign Student Boardat
Grinnell is currentlyina state
of financial stress,and unsure
of its future plans or future
status. The Board is, in the
words of chairman Shri Ven-
katessen, "pretty broke" due
to the failure of Grinnell stu~
dents to return bottles at the
soft drink machines in the
halls. Though other avenues
of financing will be explored,
this financial emergency may
affect many of the futureplans
of the Board.

The Board‘s current plans,
aside from findingmore funds,
are to continue with tholntere
national Table, whichmeetsat
5:30 Mondays in Gardner Lou-
nge.

Also, the Foreign Food Bar
zaar will take place probably
the second weekend ofNovem-
her, but no date has been set.

The major concern at this
point still is money. The pro»
blem ariscs from the factthat
many Grinnell students do not
take their bottles back to the
machines. Consequently, re-
cycling the bottlcs is difficult
and the inefficiency creates

extra costs. Looking around
the dorms, one finds bottles
everywhere but where they

should be. This financial stra»
in may produce a reduction of
foreign students nextyear, bee
sides making the Board‘s role
almost non-existent.

The Foreign Student Board
aids many foreign students
financially, and ifthemoney is
not available these students
will be in a precarious situ-
ation concerning continuing
their studies here atGrinnell.

Fifteen speakers addressed
well over one hundred students
bOth male and female. about
the Women's Movement at
Grinnell College and in the
Grinnell community, in the
South Lounge, on Wedncsday,
September 29.

The numerous speakers in-
formed the audience ofthe difr
ferent aspects of the move-
ment that they are involvedin.
Some of the areas discussed
were the history of the we-
men's Movement at Grinnell,
town relations, the radioshow
on KDIC, the proposed wo-
men's newspaper. Conoco
House, the birth control and
counseling center, the libra-
ry’s resources on women, the
role of the Career Services
Office, the hiring and firing
practices of the school, an
exchange of skills program,
and a men’s group on campus.

The two most important
areas discussedwere the birth
control and counseling center
that has been proposed for the
Grinnell community and the
general need for awareness of
the situation that most Grin'
nellians lack.

Terry Clifford presented a
concise report on theplans for
a birth control center in Grin~
hell and the difficulties that
have hinderedmore rapidpro-
gress in establishingthis Cen,
ter. Explaining the situation
at hand, Terry informed the
students that after several
years of trying to convince the
school of the need for such a
facility there has finally becn
an agreement and the college
is willing to supply $3000 [0*
wards the establishmentofthe
center.

leggett Outlines Proposed Minority Recruiting

President Glenn Leggett to-
day released to the faculty an
outline of actions to be taken
by the college to stimulate the
hiring of black faculty and the
recruiting of black students.

The action, approved by the
Executive Council, wastaken
to begin implementation of an
earlier resolution of the
college trustees callingfor "a
multi-raclal society of stu‘
dents and faculty aetingtog-etr
her in understanding and mu»
tual purpose."

Leggett’s announcement is
the latest in a series ofmoves
which began with the visit of
Dr. Randall Morgan to the
campus several weeks ago.

Leggett has written Dr. Mor-
gan for his response to the
moves made thus far, and is
expected to announce further
details in Monday’s Faculty
meeting.

Meeting for a total of four
hours on Wednesday and
Saturday, the Executive Coun-
cil also discussed several
other issues. It was unanr
imously agreed by the Council
that students shouldbeallowed
to “serve as consultants" to
the International Studies
Committee in the selection
of nominees for the Watson
Fellowships. This followed
the unanimous defeat ofa pro-
posal which would haveal‘OWV

ed the student members ofthe

Committee a direct vote on
nominees.

The Council then proceeded
to a further discussion of the
issue of Faculty size. The
Council dealt specifically with
the plans of the language (lee
partments, and it was agreed
that the Council would meet
with the assembled staff of
those departments on Septem-
ber 30.

It is expected that more der
tails on many of the issues
the Council has been discusr
sing recently will beavailable
following the discussions in
the Faculty meeting Monday.

 

quested funds from the Office
of Economic Opportunin to
finance the rest of the pro-
ject. The CEO rejected the
proposal and the plan was
taken to the Department of
Health Education andWelfare.
Some complications resulted
and the project was turned
down. Presently the proposal
is being rewritten and those
involved are hopeful that the
center will be operating by
January.

The proposed center would be
established to meet the needs
of four counties in this area.

Right now, women must tra-

vel to Des Moines in many
cases since their local doc-
tors are not equipped to hanr
dle many needs andproblems.

In the meantime a birth con-
trol and counseling centerwill
be established on the mmpus.
This facility will be located in
the Physical Education Com-
plex and will be staffedby stu‘
dent volunteers.

The volunteers will be
trained by represetntatives
from Planned Parenthood and
will be prepared to advise on
such matters as birth cons
trol, V.D., abortions, and hu-
man sexuality. Last year this
procedure was not very suc-
cessful because the people in-
volved lost enthusiasm and
there were a very limited
number trained volunteers.

The second major area of
concern for those involved in
the Women's Movement is
making people aware of the
problems of beinga woman in
our society. Grinnell women
have gotten together in con-
sciousness raising groups to
discuss the problems theyare
faced with and how others have
dealt with similar problems.

These small group meetings
have had a rap session format,
but those involved in the plan-
ning of this program are hops
ing to provide a better envir-
onment in which members can
read and discuss relevant bo-
oks and coordinate indepen'
dent projects.

The membership in these
weekly groups is not closed
