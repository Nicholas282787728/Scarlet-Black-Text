Wilderness field 5 faiion

ACM program proves tough

A Grinnell English major con-
fronts 30 pounds oi aluminum in
the Minnesota wilderness. Told to
hoist the canoe onto her shoulders,
her mind weighs probability ratios.

That was only my iirst cone
frontation with the canoes in a
challenging, happy. strange, and
enlightening few weeks this
summer in the Environmental
Biology class at the ACM Field
Station.

it struck me early that around
camp the acceptable way of
thinking was scientific. At any
given moment you could inform
yourseli of the percent humidity in
the atmosphere, simply by glan-
cing at the huge dial hanging
outside the labs. li you go inside
you might iind an eerie collection
of skulls and stuffed mammals.

Campus services curtailed

by Aunt: ucniinoli
and Dcncse Cooper

Many services on the Grlnllell
campus have been aflected by the
Buildings and Grounds strike
Establishments such as Saga, the
Physical education complex, and
the pub have been inconvenienced
by the strike. The unwillingness ot
varloils deliverers to cross
the picket line has proved to be one
oi the major problems.

The B and G strlke has made
things ”very, very inconvenient"
ior Saga, according to Jerry
Ramaker, head oi the campus iood
service. otten, union members
making deliveries for Saga reiuse
to cross the picket line, As a result,
Saga managers and maintenance
men have had to drive the trucks
themselves.

No Violence

This, according to Ramaker,
means that the service has not had
sufficient time to devote to
responsibilities within the campus.

Although deliveries have been
stopped, Ramakcr stresses the fact
that there has been no violence.

Ramaker also cites garbage
pickup as a serious problem
resulting from the strike. The city
department will not cross the
picket line in order to remove
garbage.

PE. Complex

The strike has also affected the
r. is, complex, “It’s made me a
Janitor every iour days.” said
athletic director John PIitsch,
Although the strike has had no
serious effect at the complex,
Piitsch did state that the project to
erect a balcony and observation
window over the squash courts was
not completed, Consequently, two
squash courts cannot be used due
to construction obstacles.
Otherwise, commented Pritsch,
the complex is “running with
maximum services”

Coin Machines

Among the more obvious eirects
of the strike is the lack of variety in
the campus coin machines, many
oi which are completely empty,

There's plenty of evidence that
lowa and rock music just don't
mix,

Two examples surfaced last
week. First, a Bettendorf promoter
filed a $125,000 false arrest suit
against the city of Davenport in
connection with two July concerts.
Then, a Mason City promoter gave
up his plans ior an outdoor rock
test.

The Davenport case is the most
interesting and also the most
telling, To many lowa authorities,
rock concerts equal drugsiand
that equals problems tor the
promoters.

Celebration Concerts oi
Wheeling. lllinois brought Eric
Clapton and the Doobie Brothers to
the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds
in separate July concerts,

The two concerts drew a total of
30,uou persons. But there were
about 100 drugrrelated arrests,

Police struck hack and charged
Lon Kuhlmann. an official of
Celebration with two felony counts
of sponsoring an event with the
knowledge that drugs would be
dis buted or used there.

He was booked and released
aiter posting $10,000 bond. The
charges were filed by Davenport
police against the wishes oi Scott
County Attorney Edward N Wehr

Wehr said he had asked police to
wait until his staff could complete
an investigation bciorc charges
were filed They were the first such
charges under El new lowa law.

Later, the charges were drop-
ped. Last week. Kuhlmann sued
the city oi Davenport ior false
arrest He said he had lost profits
because of the arrest, and had
incurred substantial legal fees.

Kuhlmann‘s arrest and the later
dropping oi the charges points up a
serious problem in the law. What
does constitute knowledge that a
controlled substance will be used
at an event7

As Bruce Kapp, treasurer of
Celebration Concerts pointed out,
the promoters had to obtain special
permission tor the concert irom
the Davenport City Council. The
promoters had to outline the exact
nature of the concert, and conform
to a strict set oi guidelines laid
down by the city council.

|owa,concerts don’t mix

“They approved the concerts, so
that must give the city council
‘knowledge’ (that drugs would be
used at the concerts). too,“ Kapp.
said,

Kuhlmann may be in a strong
position, because the city council
reiused approval tor a third out-
door Iest, featuring Chicago and
Loggins 8t Messina.

A city counselor cited
Kuhlmann's arrest in advising the
council to table a motion for ap~
proval or the concert.

The Davenport mess is
reminiscent of another flap about ’
Rock concerts in Des Moines last
April.

That was when Polk County
Attorney Ray Fenton proposed
that all persons attending rock
concerts at Veterans Memorial
Auditorium be [risked by police.

The avowed purpose oi the plan
was to cut down on the use of drugs
and alcohol at concerts. Fenton
proposed that all ticket purchases
for such events sign a waiver
allowing the search.

His proposal followed
February court order barring the
indiscriminate searching of rock
concert patrons previously emr
ploycd by Polk County authorities.

A storm oi protest followed
announcement oi the plan. and
little further has been heard about
it.

But the problem remains. Iowa
and rock music just don't mix well,

Just ask Mason City promoter
Amcl Lueth who gave up on having 4
a rock concert,

He wanted it outdoors—but
authorities in Belmond and Mason
City wouldn't let him Then, he
moved it to a ballroom in Clear
Lake. but the sound system broke
