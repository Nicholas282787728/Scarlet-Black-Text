The response of 31 tenured
faculty to President A, Richard
Turner's tenure policy statement
of September 15, 1977, was made
public this week.

The faculty members felt his
policy would “predictably weaken
the institution and make it far less
able to survive a period of intense
competition for students than the
tenure policy which has been in
effect for the past two decades."

THE faculty statement, worked
on by Robert Voerterman and
Ronald Kurtz, is based on the belief

that the great strength of die
College in attracting and retaining
students lies in “the high calibre of
its faculty and the commitment of
that faculty to excellence in
teaching."

It is believed that Turner‘s policy
will impair the ability to hire the
“best and brightest." Such high
quality candidates would unr
doubtedly have open to them op-
tions which include nontenurable
positions at other institutions,
Grinnell‘s unique selling point thus
must be smaller course and
preparation loads that in turn

allow more time for research and
publication. Both research and
publishing experience become
important to a person holding an
untenurable position when, after a
number of years, a new position
must be found elsewhere,

The effectiveness of the Air
firmative Action program is also
seen as a shortcoming of the
President‘s policy. ”The dif-
ficulties of recruiting women and
minorities will surely be Com-
pounded. Furthermore, recruiting
them to Second-class positions
where they cannot be tenured

clearly conﬂicts with the principles

Statehouse candidate Visits

Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tom Whitney
attacked Governor Robert Ray Tuesday for a lack
of leadership in meeting Iowa’s problems He made
his remarks on a campaign stop set up by Program
in Practical Political Education (PPPEJ.

Whitney is currently the only officially announced
candidate for governor. He officially announced his
candidacy on September is. He said, however, that
he has been campaigning since Februray.

N0 REPUBLICAN has officially announced
candidacy. Incumbent Ray, currently in his fourth
term as governor, is expected to run.

Whitney said that he intends to run an issue-
oriented campaign based on “educating the voters
to the realities of the issues." He admitted this is “a
very difficult task" but said this was necessary for
him to win in November.

WHILE admitting that Ray was a good politician,
Whitney attacked Ray for being a poor ad-
ministrator. “The people have been propagandized
by Ray and his surrogates," he said, “Ray‘s sub-
stance does not match his rhetoric."

Whitney admitted that Ray will have advantage
over any 'Democratlc candidate in the election

because of his wide name recognition.

Whitney said he expects to have a primary fight
for the Democratic nomination. He said that at least
one of me three Democratic leaders. Dale Cochran,
Jerry Fitzgerald, or George Kmley, will probably
run.

WHEN ASKED to differentiate himself from the
other possible candidates, Whitney cited his
ideology and his experience. He said he was much
more progressive on tax reform than the other
possible candidates, In particular, he said he would
have opposed the property tax revision passed last
session,

The bill was passed by a Democratically cone
trolled legislature and was supported by Cochrane,
Fitzgerald, and Kinley. The bill was approved by
Ray.

WHITNEY noted his experience as the head of
the Iowa Democratic Party and as a member of the
Board of Supervisors of Polk County. He said he was
the youngest person in Iowa to hold these positions.
He was 23 when elected as a supervisor and 29 when
he first headed the state party.

Whitney said that Ray‘s administration has failed
to meet the obligations of the state to solve the
problems of the future. He characterized Ray's
administration as “tired and unresponsive , t ,
bankrupt in ethics and substance.”

CALLING himself a populist, Whitney proposed a
local approach to solving the problems Iowa will be

gubernatorial nomination. speaks in South Lounge

facin in the 1980’s. He said that under the Ray
administration, “local communities are wasted
resources.”

specifically, Whitney advocated a local approach
to human services such as corrections, mental
health, and welfare. He pointed to a community-
based corrections program that he coauthored as a
model for the state to follow. According to one of
Whitney's aides, this program has become a model
used around the nation.

According to Whitney, “Conservation is our
greatest single pool of new oil and coal." He called
for several measures to conserve energy: energy
efﬁciency standards for appliances sold in Iowa;
minimum conservation practices for industry;
penalties for large cars getting few miles per
gallon; and “retrofitting” state buildings to make
them energy efficient,

WHITNEY attacked the Ray administration on
its energy policy, “Iowa has no energy policy,“
declared Whitney. He said that since 1973, only four
pieces of conservation legislation have been passed
by the Iowa legislature. One of these, lowering the
speed limit to 55 mph, was dictated by me federal
government Another bill, he said, “was in-
significant" A third gave the Iowa Commerce
Commiss on authority to review new construction
by utilities. The other bill placed certain restric»
tions on the architecture of new buildings, Whitney
Siad the latter two bills hardly make an effective
Iowa conservation program.

- Faculty formulates tenure counter-proposal

of Affirmative Action.

THERE is also a fear that a
serious division will occur within
the faculty between those who
connect the institution’s welfare to
their own Welfare and those un-
tenurable members of the faculty
who do not. A lack of mutual in-
terests may develop, impairing
those activities which build
strength in student attachments
and other activities beyond the
required teaching duties. Tenured
faculty’s burdens will probably be
increased because they have
“limited colleagues,” colleagues
whose interests do not involve
picking up institutional chores.

Turner’s policy, presented in
September, is based more heavily
(than a previous Turner proposal
of 1976) on a need for ﬂexibility in
the case of a Significant enrollment
drop. The increased emphasis on
this point revolves around recent
demographic projections that
indicate “in the top eighteen states
from which Grinnell draws its
students an eighteen per cent
decline in the collegerage pool will
occur before the drop bottoms
out,”

The policy removes the two
thirds per cent ceiling on the total
number oi tenured faculty because
Turner felt it gave no guidance on

‘how to act in particular cases.
‘However, he reaffirms that each
.department with three or more
fullrtime positions shall maintaln
an untenured position, except when
one tenure member is within five
years of retirement. Turner sees
the policy acting as “contingency
equity insurance" allowing for
staff cuts prior to cutting whole
programs or tenured iaculty in the
extreme case of major enrollment
drops, The plan is to finally make
clear his position when such tenure
cases occur that involve this
Contextual factor.

The benefits of the policy seem
small compared to the costs to the
College, according to the faculty
statement, Although Turner's
policy would allow for major cuts
of untenured faculty throughout
the staff in the event of an
enrollment decline, it is projected
that in ten years the number of
untenured positions without the
policy would be only slightly dif
ferent than the number of un
tenured positions with the policy.

SECONDLY. it is noted that
faculty salaries make up only
about one quarter of the total
budget and that in the event of a

 

need for a budget decrease, cuts in

FOG deficit projected

By Kathy Willhoite

Grinnell students are missing
fewer meals this year than last
year and as a result, the food
service is exceeding its 1977778 food
budget.

According to Director of the
Food Service Dave McConnell,
more money is being spent on food
due to a rise in meal attendance.
Each student is attending an
average of one meal per week
more than last year; the food
service will serve 25,000 to 26,000
more meals than it did last year.

Food service operates on a
budget that is always 100 per cent
of the total board payments. Since
this figure Varies, there is no
precise food service budget figure,
Nonetheless. McConnell predicts
that if “things go well" the food
service deficit will run in the
vicinity of iii-10,000.

THE FOOD service's budget is
divided into four parts: food, labor,
direct expense, and capital
reserve. Because the annual
budget is based on a level of ab
senteeism which is not being met
this year, the food service must
delve into its capital reserve to
supplement the food budget.

McConnell does not consider
exceeding the food budget much of
a problem at the present time. In
fact, he is pleased by the increased
participation in the food service
program. He explained the meal
attendance increase by saying,
“The program has continued to
improve in quality, and people are
basically satisfied with the
program,” He thinks people seek
fewer alternatives to eating at the
dining halls.

OTHER reasons for the increase

The ultimate

in food expenditure include the fact
that the more popular foods, such
as tacos, pizza, and BLTs, are
being served more often. And
although steak is served three
times every four weeks (instead of
every Saturday night as it was last
year), it is betterquality meat, it is
served in larger portions, and it is
being served to more people,

Inﬂation also accounts for some
of the strain on the food budget.
McConnell is counting on a six per
cent inflationrrate, but he hopes to
minimize its affect “through efr
fective management,” which in-
cludes minimizing waste, making
prudent purchases, and using a
bidding procedure for food items.

THE FOOD Service Will not be
able to make as many capital
improvements as it had wanted
because the capital reserve is
being used for food expenses.
Capital reserve is budgeted for
updating facilities and purchasing
new equipment. McConnell said,
however, “I would rather maintain
the quality of the program than cut
the quality and purchase equip-
ment,"

McConnell, in his second year as
director of the Grinnell food ser—
vice, finds his job exciting and fun,
but is disappointed in the lack of
student interest. He receives daily
complaints, yet the turnout has
been low at his monthly open
forums where students can voice
their comments. complaints, and
suggestions,

THE DIRECTOR also plans to
“embark upon a program of waste
and nutritional awareness for

 

students," which may include a
mini-course on foods and nutrition.
