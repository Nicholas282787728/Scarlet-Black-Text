tion received from the statement.

The schedule allows the children
lree play, snacks, stories, music
and language activities, art activi—

lunch planned by a dietician. On cerr
tain days special activities are plan-

Discussing the evaluations, Mr.

evaluation will not be available for
several weeks.

National Saga Expands, Includes Purple turtles

by David Crow

Every student on Grinneli’s campus
knows what SAGA is: the college
food service. But somewhere, out in
the netherland beyond Conoco house
—- SAGA is out there, too.

It began in 1943 when three seniors
at Hobart College in Geneva, New
York, took over the operation olthat
school’s cafeteria. The name SAGA
came from the Indian name oi Gen-
eva, Kanadesaga, The management
became so successlui that the oper-
ation began expanding to other col-
leges, including, in 1953, Grinneli,
which until that time had run its own
iood service.

—Hospital Division

In 1963 the company startedaHasr
pital Division to serve hospitals
which do not prepare their own lood,
and in 1968 purchased the Harding»
Williams corporation of Chicago,
which became the business-industry
division. A chain at restaurants,
called “Velvet Turtles” was added
in 1970 along with a series at “Straw
Hat" pizza stands. In 1971 the com»
pany went public with its ﬁrst stock
altering and so far this year has
negotiated the purchase ola number
oi ”Black Angus” steak houses.
SAGA now operates in all but six
states at the United States, in Puerto
Rico," in Canada‘, and in Australia.

Still in spite at all this expansion,
SAGA is mainly concentrated in the
Americas and is predominantly in'
the college iood service business.
Like the various other divisions of
the company, the College Division is
based at SAGA'S national headquar-
ters in Menlo Park, California. The
local SAGA service is under a re-
gional oiiice in Kalamazoo, Michi—
gan, and a District office located in
Cedar Rapids. From Cedar Rapids
the District manager supervises the
operation at a number or college food
services. of

the twelve ACM L

schools, three still run their own
operations; SAGA has contracts with
six of the other nine.
Gets $600,000

The college owns all the iood 591-,
vice facilities -- ouad, Cowles,
Forum Grill -- and all at the equip-
ment in them such as the tables,
ovens, dish machines, glasses, etc,
SAGA is under contract, reviewed
yearly, to manage these iacilities
and to provide the food service. To
do so, it buy: the load and hires a
stall to prepare it, Additionally, it
is responsible lor the maintenance
ol the physical plantwhich itis oper-
ating. Thus, SAGA must pay ior
glasses, dishes, and Silverware
which are broken or ripped»oll, as
well as repairs on the ovens, re»
irigerators, and dish machines.
For these services. SAGA is paid
a iee oi approximately $600,000
from the $530 hoard Cost that those
students on lull board pay. Mr.
Ralph Pomerenk, college business
manager, indicated that there should
be a 15% gap over what the college
takes in from board tees and what it
pays SAGA, in order to provide tor
the eventual necessity of replacing
the facilities. This the college has
been unable to do, because costs
have climbed while the college has
kept board fees the same {or the
past two and une»hall years. Still,

Pomerenk says, Grinnell has one
of the lowest board costs of all the
ACM schools.

Pennies At A Time

Control ol cost is a chiet concern
oi Mr. Jeri-y Ramaker, SAGA head
on campus. Ramaker says SAGA
works on it “pennies, notdollars,at
a time," Holding down costs bene»
iits students both by preventing a
rise in board costs and by permit-
ting an increased selection and a
better quality oi food served, Ra—
maker said. SAGA policy prevents
overrlarge proiits, since the come
pany assumes that making excessive
profits in the short-term could only
be achieved by lowering quality, a
development which would indicate
eventual loss of contract and conse
quent abolition oi long-term proiits.
Thus Ramaker disclaims any pro-
tit-making intention in the effort to
lower costs.

His biggest expense is waste, which
includes leftover load which students
have taken but not eaten as Well as
losses due to theft and breakage ol
plates and glasses. This SAGA has
sought to reduce this problem by
serving smaller portions. Ramaker
commented that savings oi only a
iew cents per student per meal
would result in signiiicant cost de»
creases
