These past few weeks, we at Grinnell have had an
opportunity to View at first hand some rare power-politics.
Unfortunately, these political maneuverings have
damaged the credibility of the administrative decision-
makers, and we, the students have lost in the bargain.

It still seems that at this late date we do not yet have all
the real reasons behind how the reorganization was
decided on.

It is hard for an administration which espouses a policy
of ”looking for the best person for the job" to justify
dismissal of a current employee in College Services (Ralph
Pomerank) due to his partial qualifications for the new job
description in that area, while ushering another partially
qualified candidate (Tom Latimer) into a new job
description in the area of Student Services. It seems that
there are at least two “rationales” working
simultaneously here.

Accumulating statistics are indicating that even the
economic argument doesn‘t wash in Georgia Dentel‘s case.
Not only is it apparent that Ms. Dentel saves the school
sizable amounts of money in obtaining films and concerts,
but she has also offered to take a drastic cut in salary, in
order to be retained.

This is clearly a time in the school‘s history to examine
student priorities. Questions like “Would the loss of one
RlAl position have as great an impact on the quality of
student life as the elimination of a full-time activities
counsellor?" need to be asked [especially when we have
one as eminently qualified as Ms. Dentel). The point is,
that questions like this were not addressed to those closest
to the situation and those in the best position to con-
tribute a valuable opinion—the students. It is unfortunate
that there wasn‘t a “Dean of Student Services" to lobby
for our interests with the Administration.

With an administration which has demonstrated that it
is a “self-contained" entity, how can students have any
control over their four-year experience known as Grinnell?
Perhaps it will be a slow process of natural evolution.
Student input will be ignored . l r the quality of student life
may suffer. If it does, the fact that Grinnell‘s at-
tractiveness is largely a “word of mouth”;process will
damage the school‘s reputation. It is not difficult to on-
vision the final product of this slide as a social program in
a condition analogous to that of our dormatories at the
present time

It is not even totally inconceivable that at some point in
the future a “social consultant" might be called in to
collect student opinion for possible improvement of the
cultural programming of the school Study breaks could
be held in the beautiful hall lounges to discuss what sort of
films and concerts students would like to see. Then a fund
drive could be initiated to collect the money needed to
fulfill these needs.

Perhaps there is an easier and more immediate way to
.gauge the students needs and desires in the area of ,social
programming. Come to think of it, has anyone asked you
whether you would prefer to spend money on your living
quarters or on your cultural program?

Alumnus chides

administration

Dear Grinnell

I am proud once again to con-
tribute to Grinnell College as an
alumnus of this excellent in-
stitution.

However, I am disconcerted by
the moves that occurred in the
administration just prior to my
arrival in Grinnell this fall. To my
understanding the six adr
ministrators under President A.
Richard Turner were fired in order
that the Staff could be decreased to
three for reasons of meeting
budget expenses. President Turner
then hired two of the men
previously on the staff, and conr
sidering the third. to fill the three
positions and ignored ule three
women originally on the staff.

The action taken by President
Turner is a disgrace. I recognize
the need for budget cuts during the
present national economic period
of uncertainty and the trend on
national and local levels to con-
serve money, bul the manner in
which [his particular situation was

brashly handled shows a disregard
for the need [or more women in
college administration and fur-
Lhermore was a slap in the face to
every individual, male or female,
associated With Grinnell College as
well as the institution as a whole
for unbiased and equal op-
portunity. I say this particularly
when one of the men reinstated
himself admitted that he 'Was
unqualified for the position and
that two of the Women let go, who
to my understanding have served
the college very well in the past
and together were better qualified
ior that position, applied for that
position al hall pay.

Mv contribution is for; lunding
affirmative action and Equal
Employment Opportunity lor all
people of both sexes, of all races,
and from all ethnic and Socio-
economic backgrounds so lhal this
situation can be rectified and will
never occur again at Grinnell
College. Richard Kellar

To the Editor: Due to the recent
administrative upheavals cone
cerning the iulure of women a:

where it all will end. The rumor is
that the President has decided not

To the Editor: The Organized
Student Action Committee is ac-
tively seeking to resolve the
problems presented to the students
by recent administrative
reorganizaliun plans. The com-
mittee pursues its goals through a
variety of activities. Some
members have joined the com-
mittees formed by SGA to redress
the grievances in the areas of
student input, affirmative action,
and social and recreational
programming. Most helped to
organize a successful day of
presentations informing the
parents and alumni of the students’
interests. All of us are now
preparing for future appeals lo
‘fellow students, to the ad-
ministration, and to the Trustees.

The committee reaffirms its
committment to an effective
communication of concerns. While
theatrical presentations have been

 

 

 

.‘used iodramalize student plights,

such a melhod is only one avenue
open to us. We are now writing and
will distribute an information
packet in the Board of Trustees
this weekend. This packet presents
an articulate and well-reasoned
argument for the students’ position
and includes several practical
solutions. Hopefully, this packet
will help inform the Trustees and
persuade them of our genuine
desire to effect a satisfactory
resolution.

Plans are now being made to
increase student participation by
informing more Students of the
situation. The Committee will
sponsor hall meetings for
discussion, attempt to presenl a
half hour program on Knic with
time alloied to answering phoned-
in questions, and hold a bake sale.
The committee desires to build
student support which is felt to be
the major factor in the success of
the protest: The students 85' 'a

OSA looks for more student support

Collective entity have the ability to
persuade the administration to
modify its position. More involved
students insures grealer chances
for an agreeable conclusion.

The committee is working
towards the implementation of the
following proposals: the adoption
of a written affirmative action
policy, the adoption of a writte '
student input policy. and the
reinstatement of Georgia Dentel
and Kathy McCluskey to their
present positions or alternative
positions which ulilize their
talenls. Q

OSA will continue to present
these and other proposals as long
as lhey are needed. Therefore, ll
will meet every Monday night a:
7:30 Hi Gardner Lounge. All
students are more than welcome to
any and every meeting and should
feel free to ask any queslion at
those meetings—The OSA Conl-
niitlce.
