of the several issues ar g
out oi the adniiiiistratve re-
organization, the one oi most
immediate short~term concern to
the administration is the question
oi the possible eiicct upon
programming We have reviewed
careiully and at length the
reasoning and factual presen-
tations made by various members
oi the community, and conclude
that there is sutticient possibility
that there will be adverse eiiects to
warrant an adjustment in‘ our
decision.

Accordingly. Dean Walker has
otiei-ed his. oentel a halt-time
position as booking agent ior social
and cultural events, and has at»
lered Ms. MeCtuskey a part rne
position to teach credit-recei ing
outdoor activities classes in the
Department oi Physical
Education, the exact extent of the
appointment to he determined on
turthor studynNeither person has
as yet accepted appointment, and
all other aspects or the
reorganization remain the same.

The above statement was
released to the college community
by President Turner on the Friday
atternoon beginning iall break, For
many students, this marked the
apparent end to a long struggle for
a student voice in cultural and
recreational programming
Others, however, have viewed
these employment otters as mixed
blessings

While representing a major
change of position for the ad
ministration, this Job offer does not
necessarily reflect a change in
their attitude, President Turner
stressed that in modifying the
administrative reorganization to
make room for Daniel and MC-

 

they will not include. McCluskey
has been informed that her position
will not include any working
relationship with the Grinnell
Outdoor Recreation Program
which has proiiteo irom her ex-
perlise over the past few years.
The position being offered her will
include only teaching ”course
offerings within the Physical
Education Curriculum "
Ironically. in light of the fact. that
McCluskey’s strongest defense
issued from GORP, her new
position will be completely isolated
from that group's interests,

Georgia Dentel’s job, if she
decides to accept it, will have a
somewhat different character than
the position she now occupies, a
primary difference being that she
will not be producing the activities
calendar that students receive
every month Mr. Latimer has
indicated that he has no plans for
continuing this service.

Preparation of this calendar
currently occupies a great deal of
Ms. Dentel’s time. She explained
that many groups come to her to
schedule activities into the
calendar with unsubstantial plans,
often conflicting with other major
events or even ialliiig on school
holidays Thus her job not only
entails the mechanics of producing
the calendar, but a great degree of
counseling to groups and in-
dlviduals who need help in
arranging and organizing their
planned activities. This function
will probably be phased out of
student services

Admissions also has a stake in
seeing that the monthly calendar is
produced. 30!) copies of each
month‘s calendar are sent to the
admissions office and are vieviod
as a major drawing card tor

'5' While representing a change of poxition by
the administration, this job oﬂer does not
neccecarily reﬂect a change in attitude . . .
President Turner stressed that the adminis

tration is not admitting f

tmlt in its previous

decision, but that the change was eﬂected
‘for programmatic reasons”.

Cluskey, the administration is not
admitting to iauit in its previous
decision, asserting that the change
was eiiected “for programmatic
reasons” Yetthe offer, as it stands
at this writing, still leaves some
questions unanswered.

At the time that the positions
were ottered to Dentel and Mc-
cluskey, no detinitive job
descriptions accompanied them. it
is for this reason that as oi Wed-
nesday, neither party had accepted
the offers. Both Georgia and Kathy
exhibit a ”waitrandssee” attitude
toward these dcscrptions.

While it is not yet public
knowledge what these iob offers
will entail, the administration has
let on to some of the laccts that

prospective students,

At any rate, the new offers have
created more questions than they
have answered . some of them
inevitable, What factors inﬂuenced
the administration’s turnaround”
Since no tangible form ot‘ ion
security can be extended toward
“administrative" staff, are the
positions being offered these
women as vulnerable to a second
swipe as their previous jobs were?
will student input be sought more
readily in future considerations of
this type?

Many students hope that the
administrative handling of this
matter points toward a new trend
oiadministrative accountability to
the student body and mutual trust.

OSA redefined

by Mary liraiult

with the administration's
decision to oiier partrtime
positions to two of the women tired
in the recent reorganization,
Organized Student Action tOSAl
has moved to reevaluate and
clariiy its goals,

Formed earlier this semester as
an immediate response to the
controversial administrative rec
shufﬂe, OSA had a three-fold area
of concern: the quality of social
and cultural programming, the
apparent disregard tor student
input, and the question of air
iirmative action in hiring and
firing. While these goals
corresponded closely to those oi
SGA'S, the members of OSA enr
visioned a more powerful answer
to the administration’s move
through less bureaucratic, more
direct tactics. Accordingly. the
organization was vocal and active
during both Parents' and Alumni
weekend and the recent trustees‘
meeting on campus,

Now, however

the adrhoc

 

committee is moving iroin the
sliortrterm goals of the [irst half of
the semester to a longer-range
view of the issues brought out.
spemfically affirmative action and
student input, Regarding the part-
time position ortered to Georgia
Dentel and Kathy lvtcCluskey,
Ellyn Toscano, head of OSA,
commented that “Although I think
more information needs to be
known about the positions, the
Conditions they’ll be working
under, and the amount of in
dependent demsionrmaklng each
woman will have, the move is
basically a good one on the part oi
the administration,”

in dealing with the goal at at-
firmative action OSA plans to do
research into sex discrimination,
by investigating the past and
present status oi women at
Grinnell as well as the specifics of
the current laws pertaining to
Grinnell's situation, and the
College’s responsibility under the
laws,

 

“There's a problem here in that

the inapirity til the student body is
not involved or really aware of the
issues and type or research that's
being done," remarked Toscano.
"Students are aware of the major
problems with the reorganization
but not the specitics At this point
we're thinking more along the lines
of fulfilling an educative function
for the campus in terms or making
the issues more public and better
understood."

Although OSA appears to be
duplicating SGA's function in this
matter, Toscano sees OSA‘S
relationship to the officially sanc-
tioned Student voice as a symb' (‘0
one, “in terms of affirmative
action SGA has set up a student-
taculty committee headed by Dean
Eysenbach. This committee is now
doing research such as Writing to
other schools to find out what their
affirmative action policies are.
USA members are also par-
ticipating on this SGA committee.
But in general osa is utilizing
sharper methods for the same
goals "

The group will meet again next
Monday, the Elh, at 7:30 in Gardner
Lounge to begin work on specific
plans oi action. All interested
members of the community are
invited to participate.

“We are living in one of the great
watershed periods oi history,

This was an important election,
and it was clear that Grinnell
College was well aware oi that
Tuesday. it was equally clear that
most students were unsure oi what
they should do with the election.
and any observations oi the
current political situation on
campus are highly contradictory.

In terms of active involvement,
on the one hand there was a high
degree oi general interest in and
knowledge about the returns as
they came in tas is evidenced by
the hundreds or students clustered
around various televisions election
nightl. However. political

organizers around east-central
lowa have been heard to complain
loudly about how few volunteers
the college yielded for election day
work as compared to previous
years. Concurrently a significant
number of students were
overheard to remark that they had
failed to send away icr an absentee
ballot in time to vote. in sharp
contrast to two years ago, KDIC's
phone lines were not jammed ivith
callers wanting results on home
races: not a single call was
received there asking about Illinois
Congressman Abner Mlkva, a man
usually very popular in Grinnell.

Democrats Still seemed to have
the solid numerical majority on
campus, but Republicans were
conspicuously active for the
first time in recent memory. The
latter not only distributed-more
literature and posters than-did the

trying harder to convince
everybody within earshot.
However, it does appear that the
new surge oi Republican activity
can be attributed to a small
number of hard-core Republican
activists, rather than to a sub-
stantive increase in mass support.
But the long-range effects at
having a Viable two party system
on campus instead of only a
Democratic organization may be
important. especially when one
takes into account the political
inarginality of this region.

The devoted support that Fred
Harris received last year was
matched tiii intensity, but not in

McCarthy, Although unable to
really overcome doubts about
McCarthy's credibility, Mca
Carthyites plugged on with the only
studentrrun campaign in the
county, and they probably were
responsible for getting many
students to the polls who otherwise
would have not Voted.

A sober note was that many
students walked all the way down
to Fairview School to vote last
Tuesday only to find that they were
not registered, or that they were
registered to vote in other
precincts Unquestionably, the
very poorly run SGA registration
