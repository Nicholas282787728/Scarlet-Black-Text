Each academic department at
, Grinnell has a student EPC
jomprised oi no more than five,
Q; usually {our majors. elected by the
majors of the department to serve
[or one academic year. Smaller
departments may have iewer
members. Last semester. for
‘ example. classics had only one.

As they now exist. EPCs try to
represent students in all

decisions oi educational policy.
Each committee has a chairman

who in most departments meets

regularly or quasirregularly with

the department faculty chairman

Vto discuss all matters of
educational concern. Less
frequently, the [acuity department
chairman will meet with the entire
EPC of that department. When the

ineed arises. the entire department
faculty may meet with the entire
EPC.

‘ In general, than the committees
act as a liaison between majors.
students and faculty. Speciﬁcally.
the EPCS have five main functions.
They continually evaluate the
department curriculum. They help
conduct evaluations of candidates
tor teaching positions. for tenure

and for contract renewal. They
also periorm a social tunction in
planning parties or coffee hours to
bring majors and professors
together.

The way in which each EPC
evaluates the curriculum varies
with each department. Generally.
most department EPCs meet with
majors or other interested students
several times a year. especially
near the end of each semester. to
discuss changes in courses or new
courses for the next semester or
the next year. or to discuss trends
they would like to see over a longer
Deriod of time.

However. curriculum evaluation
is a more important and time
consuming process for the history
committee. say, than for the
mathematics one. Departments
such as history. political science,
or sociology contain courses which
concern current or recent events.
or issues which change over time.
Also. they generally have a wider
range oi possible special topics
courses. Therefore. on-going
curricular evaluation and main
taming flexibility seem to become
more important.

Mathematics, on the other hand.
has a more standard, fixed
curriculum, as EPC chairman Jim
Freeman pointed out. While the
department does indeed evaluate
its curriculum. there are many
more basic courses and sequences
of courses that must be taught in
order to teach the extensive.
detailed principles of
mathematics.

Consequently, the mathematics
EPC spends relatively little timE
on course evaluation and more
time on organizing regular coffee
hours, or student talks.

While students help decide what
courses are in and what courses
are out of the curriculum. who
teaches what course is usually
decided among the taculty. The
structure and syllabus of any
particular course is the domain oi
the individual professor teaching
it. except for courses established
as standard by the department
such as PollSci 101. in which the
reading list is common to all
sections.

The procedure ior evaluating
tenure and contract renewal
candidates is a Standard one
formulated by Dean Waldo
Walker. Depending on its nature
(literature. foreign language.
science etc.) each department
EPC receives one oi six types oi
questionnaires. They receive a
random listing oi iorty people. who
have had at least one course with
the professor in question. to in-
terview according to the
questionnaire. The EPC gathers
and compiles the answers and tries
to formulate one recommendation.
which it expresses in a letter to
Walker. Questions. answers,
compilations and computations are
also sent to, him. The‘faculty,
meanwhile. conducts its own

evaluation and prepares its own
report to Walker. While the
questions concerning a tenure
candidate may differ from those
for a candidate for contract
renewal. the basic procedure is the
same.

However. procedures ior
evaluating candidates for teaching
positions vary considerably from
EPC to EPC. The basic procedure
for most departments is for the
EPC and faculty to review
resumes and then invite certain
candidates to be interviewed in
Grinnell.

Some EPCs submit their
recommendations separately to
Walker. others. as a practice.
Combine theirs with that of the
facility. Some EPCs. such as the
philosophy committee. entertain a
strict equality with the faculty. ii
the philosophy EPC decides that
they definitely do not want a
certain candidate to be considered
for hiring. then that opinion
overrides the faculty's. Similarly.
if the faculty finds a candidate
wholly unacceptable. that opinion
overrides the students'. and the
candidate is dismissed out right as
a possibility. Otherwise. if a
candidate is acceptible to some
and not to others. a consensus must
be reached,

Other EPCs such as history or
biology act in a more advisory
capacity. in most decisions. Yet
even Biology EPC chairman
Tristram Parslow called the
relationship with the faculty one of
“surprising equality."

One oithe problems which arises
with the )3ch is that they are
made up of all majors and often. to
represent only the department’s
majors. A conﬂict arises, ex-
plained Phillip Kintner. chairman
oi the history department and
speaking of that department in
particular. between majors’
educational desires and objectives
and the need for nonmajor
programs.

For example. at a recent history
majors‘ meeting. desire for more
historiography and special topics
courses was expressed. This
pressure must be balanced with
the pressure for more courses to
serve the non-majors.

Similarly. John Gourlay.
psychology EPC chairman said
that the psychology majors were
trying to resist pressure from the
administration for more
humanistic psychology courses
and sociology related courses. The
majors want to stay with the
present courses. most of which are
behavtoristic Gourlay said’ the
behaviorist courses are very
important ior training ior graduate
school or research. a goal of most
majors.

“How. precisely. one balances
all this without stepping on toes. I
don't know." Kintner remarked.

After this representation oi a swastika and a star oi David were
painted on the Cinema Theatre window in Grinnell about ten students
iniormed Larry Gilbert. theatre manager. that they iouiid it oiiensive.

movie “The Hiding Place" which will be at the cinema Feb. 12. 13. and
M. John Voss. promotion coordinator oi the movie in Poweshiek
County. is renting the theatre to show the movie on these days. Carol

Housing limited

by Tom Pantea

The Office of Student AIfairs
decided late last week that next
year the number of students living
in noncollege owned housing will
be limited to 150. The decision was
due to the smaller enrollment
figures and the need for cuts in
housing costs. it was based on the
concept that Grinnell College is
and will remain a residential
campus. Presently there are 173
Students living 0“ campus. 104
seniors and so juniors. Next year
all seniors will be allowed to move
off and the remaining number of
spaces leit will go to the juniors.
The 23 less people living off
campus next year will provide the
college with an additional $9.890 for
the year.

After the decision was made an
open forum was held Tuesday
night by James Tederman. dean of
student affairs. and Susan Grim.
assistant dean of student affairs.
Approximately 20 students voiced
various complaints about the
decision. Most felt that they should
have the right to decide where they
should live and that the limit will
force those unable to move off to
ﬁnd a School that would better
provide theliving option they want.

Though discussion at the
meeting was largely negative,
Tederman and Crim said at-
terwards that the forum had not
produced arguments strong
enough to cause them to reconsider
their decision. Though they have
set the level. the housing com-
mittee will determine how the
policy should be implemented. The
policy also has to be approved by
the social policy and Regulatio

Committee and SGA. . .

At the forum. major complaints
about dorm life centered around
the poor physical condition of the
residences and problems of in-
teraction among the residents.
Both Tederman and Grim agreed
that the dorms were in terrible
conditions; in fact Crim revealed
that 10 years ago the trustees
purposely decided not to put any
money into the dorms in favor of
the academic buildings. However,
Crim said that she is presently
lobbying ior $500,000 tor dorm
renovation. She commented that
after their visit last semester, the
trustees seem ready to make a
commitment for dorm renovation.
Presently to make dorm liie more
attractive. many of the rooms have
had their occupancy rate cut so
that now there are 442 singles on
campus. Two hundred rooms have
been painted since last spring. and
carpeting will belaid in two dorms.

In response to the complaints oi
conflicts between residents. such
as excess noise, Tederman felt that
much of the problem lies wlth the
persons being affected since
there seem to be few who are
willing to stand up ior their rights.
He added that the college has the
judicial council to settle conﬂicts
but so far this year not one case
had been brought to the council.

At the meeting the subject of
closing college owned houses also
came up, The fact that in the past
few years there has been ins
creasing diiiiculty in filling the
houses. plus the fact that there are
100 spaces open on campus.
prompts Student Affairs to decide
to close two houses next year
because of the added burden they
out. on the. budget. .........
