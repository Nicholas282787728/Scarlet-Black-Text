A Protest Of Protest

We would like to protest the protests by members of the
Peace Collective and other individuals regarding the visit
of a Marine Corps recruiter to campus last Tuesday. Their
actions represent a philosophy which, it carried to its exc
treme, would call for the destruction of the very society
which has fought for the preservation of the free speech they
now exercise.

This is, to repeat the obvious, an open campus. Any opinions
and positions should be able to be expressed here—~that is
straight from the liberal American idea oi democracy, Pres
sumably it one has all information available to him he can
make his own judgments, iorm his own opinions, and arrive
by that process at a more logical and rational conclusion.

Those who protest the appearance of the Marine recruiter,
however, would change that so that not all information is
available, that in making our judgments about the military
the students at an enlightened and liberal college would have
to base their thought processes on one-sided information.

Perhaps the most puzzling thing about the actions of the
protesters, however, is the fact that they actually did find it
necessary to restrict the Marine recruiter’s ability to have

.his say. If indeed the military is an immoral organization

and the killing of human beings is a disgusting enterprise,
then presumably members of the campus community would
have arrived at that conclusion on their own despite the ap»
pearance of literature to the contrary.

The defacing of the literature, however, implies that it we
saw it, we might not have come to agree with the Peace
Collective’s point of view, so that the literature represented
something of danger which had to be done away with.

The action thus has interesting implications for the desire
ability of open discussion and the rationality of the antimie
litarist view,

In order that we might all not limit ourselves by adopting
prejudicing premature mindsets, therefor, we urge that mem-
bers of the campus community allow anyone with any opinion
to have their say. There is no more reason whyaMarine
recruiter’s propaganda should be restricted than anyone
else’s.

For example, that of the Peace Collective.

Iowa State And ISPIRG

The Iowa Student Public Interest Research Group (ISPIRG)
chapter at Iowa State University decided last week to refuse
to support the state ISPIRG organization and thus has with—
held from it the funds collected from students torISPIRG
this semester. This action, in our opinion, is extremely
harmful to both the concept and the operation oflSPlRG,
and could set a dangerous precedent which could possibly
lead to the destruction of one of the most worthwhile student
organizations ever founded.

The legality of the move is not the point The Iowa State
group evidently does not realize that the nature of lSPIRG
is to bring together students all over the state-mot just
students of one particular school, or students with apar-
ticular set of interests, or students who share the same
philosophy, but all students, as a group—~to form an organ-
ization which, unlike many others, may have some clout in
the area of public interest research and legislation.

The organizers of ISPIRG saw that student unity could be a
valuable force. And it is a valuable force. But the action of
the Iowa State group, particularly because of its monetary
significance, destroys the whole concept of the organization.

The likely result will be a drastic curtailment of profes~
sional staff positions and salaries, and will take away from
ISPIRG exactly the expertise it needs in the continuing work
of asserting the public interest.

As members of a campus where lSPlRG enjoys wide student
support and where the usefulness of projects on both a local
and state level is becoming recognized, Grinnellians should
protest the move. By destroying the unity and much of the
professional ability of ISPIRG the Iowa State group has lim-
ited our right to be heard.

It’s our organization they are destroying.

Be Informed

Now that the candidates for SGA President have been de-
termined and the open debate in the South Lounge is set
for next Wednesday, we urge all students to spend some
time next week educating themselves on the viewpoints and
positions of the individuals involved. The more knowledge,
able the people who vote on the 19th, the more accurate will
be the representation students will have in student govern-
ment next year. We urge everyone to take advantage of the
opportunity.

Hirsch: Explains SGA Finance Actions

To the Editors:

Last week's editorial entitled,
“The SGA Game” contained points
that are generally Well taken, How
ever, a number oi examples used to
support your arguments are theme
selves examples of incomplete re-
porting. Specifically, ltake issue
with your statement, “lhei..SGA
Treasurer, who was supposed to
serve without reimbursement, was
giving himself a salary irom slur
dent monies while cutting back funds
to other student organizations, not-
ably KDIC; and a resolution was
passed substantially reducing the
independence and power oi the Stu»
dent Auditor..."

KDIC experienced a $200 cut back
in lunds for it’s maintenancebudget.
This was felt to be a justified move
by members oi the Finance Come
mittee particularly in light oi the
fact that the Station Engineer re»
fused to answer questions urexplain
what the money would be used for,
and upon going to the station Mane
ager, he was unable to answerthese
same questions except to say that
$60 oi the requested 3300 would
probably pay for tubes readytoburn
out in the transmitter. ltbecameap-
parent that the money requested for
maintenance was a “just in case"
fund.

So, yes, KDlC’s budget was out,
however the editorial makes it ape
pear as though 11 was cut in order
to give the Treasurer a salary. in

The salary had to be proposed,
and like the cut in KDIC’S budget,

Gorrell: Communications Benefits

(Ed. note: CurtGorrell, EPC chair~
man for the Communications deparlv
ment, recently addressed the rollow-
ing letter to members or the admin-
istratinn concerning the Depart-
meat. 11 is reprinted here at his
request in full.)

To the sailors

The following is a statement exr
pressing my concern overthe educa-
tional policies of this college, spe-
citicallv with regard to the future
oi the Communications department.
(Two short excerpts from this state
ment were incorporated into Steve
Nunn's sob article last Friday, Feb-
ruary 2).

i believe that the “Concerned Com~
munications Students” have laced
the question or the future of the
Communications department at
Grinnell by submitting (11/1/72)
2 very positive program for the de-
velopment oi that department.

1 would like to refer again to Dr.
Glenn Leggett’s statement, quoted
in the Maynlune, 1972 issue of the
Grinnell Magazine, that this college
needs a progressive edncnlional
program that will keep Grinnell irom
becoming justanothersmallcol-
lege located in a cornfield.”

I subscribe to that statement, and
to the ldeals which underlie it, 100%,
And I believe that the program pre
sented by the Concerned Communir
cations Students, its suggested cur-
riculum and recommendations, is
also 100% consistent with those
ideals. The program aims at long
term benefits; it takes a broad perr

Joint Boards was that hall funds
should be able to be used to buy
liquor. one person, theStudentAud-
itor, ior purely personal reasons
said to the Joint Boards, "no”.
1 fully respect the Audltor's rigllt

old beliefs contrary to the op-
inion oi the Joint Board, however,
in her offlcal position, such per
sonal reasons as “protecting the
students {or their own good” have
to be suppressed and Joint Board
policy must be pursued. Such pol-
icy was not belngpursuedandtherer
fore legislation was introduced
which would enable the SGA Trea-
surer to instruct the Auditor to do
50.

Let me remind the reader that we
are talking only about SGA money
and the right for the son to der
termlne how it will spend its own
money. in no way, contrary to the
previous week’s editoral, did this
proposed legislation hinder the ”1m
dependence and power” of the Slur
dent Auditor. 1i the editors feel
dlfferently, l urge them to deal
in speciiics and show their rea»
sons ior claiming the Auditor’s of»
{ice has been stripped oi its pow-
ers, This is simply not the case.

The budget is available for anyone
who wishes to see it, and 1 would
welcome any questions or criticism
about it or any other aspect of stur
dent monies. Better yet, 1 urge you
to start asking questions. Here's a
few for starters:

1 is the public events program

worth the 37,500 that it gets, realr
izlng that what-ever money goes
there is nor, obviously, given to
the social coordination committee.
(concerts, etc) Have the number
and quality or social events been
satisfactory?

2, Should academic credit be given
in lieu of salaries? Salaries total
$4,950. ($1,250 of which, 1 might
point out, is paid to employees of
the sue)

3 There is $12 left in the Tv
maintenance iund. What happens
when the next TV breaks down?
Where does the money come from?

These are problems that the son
is trylng to solve, and unfortunate-
ly, there are plenty more where they
came irbm.

loballo: Defends Destruction

To the Editors:

1 am writing this in response to
a eulogy delivered by Tom Miller
in his letter of last week Before
1 make an explanation, 1 want to
declare my responsibility for the
extermination of "the libidinous
snow sculpture”.

The reason for its consummate anr
nihllation was not due to an exoe
tic sexual perversion, and your
claim of impotence on my part is
quite ironic considering the speed
with which the sculpture withered
and crumbled under my graceful
pummeling. Alas, you dared to call
that misrepresentation, “a true
work of art”. Look at it now. Art
is eternal. Your sculpture is now ynsl
another slush puddle in central cam—
pus, craving evaporation.

1i you will allow me to paraphase
Oscar Wilde, there is no such thing
as a moral or an immoral snow
sculpture. Snow sculptures are well
constructed or badly constructed.
That is all.

spective of what a liberal arts col-
lege can offer to its students to
be, not Simply Viable, but to be in-
novative and attractive to develop-
ing minds.
But in reviewing the staiﬂngforthe
Communications department, and
thus the question of its iuture, I
feel that some Executive Council
members may be getting hung up
in a narrow perspective, are overly
concerned with short term goals.
Cut three faculty members, kill
this department, and other depart-
ments will have that much more lat-
itude and money going for them.
This sort oi internal political man-
euvering would benefltno onelfthere
is no long term perspective. If this
sort or orientation should come to
govern Executive Council decisions,
than in the long term Grinnell won’t
be just another small collegelocated
in a cornfield, it will be justa corn,
iield.

Finally, the sculpture was a work
oi caricature, not art, 1 consider—
ed myself both critic and artist in
this sltuation. Quotlng irom Mr.
Wilde directly, “no artist has et-
hical sympathies, An ethical sym-
pathy in an artist is an unpardon»
able mannerlsm of style.” It was
not the “wind oi puritanism", but
a sense of beauty, an act oi inspire
ation, that brought it to the ground.

Peters, Hughes:
Involvement

To the Editors:

Regarding Mr, Aronin’s letter of
Friday past, we would like to ex-
press the iollowing opinions on Grin-
nell mules:
mrhere seems to be a prevalent
number devoted only to the pursuit
oi scholarly endeavors.

-~—There is a profusion of young
men With a strong inclination to-
wards dnalyzmg a relationship to an
unnatural degree, all Joy is lost.
urThere exists an unmlstakeable
pressure to avoid a deep commit
ment, emotlonal involvement is
thought oi as nor belonging in an in»
tellectual environment
"-The majority ol'males on campus
have an appalling lack of considera—
tlon, depression among females iS as
commonplace as the flu
mApnuiy is perhaps the major
cause of the surprisingly low number
oi lasting l‘elatlonshlps, As liberal
as Grinnell is reputed to be, there
is still adeflnite “double standard,”
if i female were to make the iritial
advance, she would be branded as
a tease.

Finally, Mr Aronin, Grillnell fe-
males are not bound by “Vlctorlan
shackles,” as you suggest Rather,

involvement, not a more “body
