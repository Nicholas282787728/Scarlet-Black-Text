Next Semester
HousingConsidered

by Merry Wiesner

The minute the results or the
questionnaire circulated to all stus
dents living in college housing are
in, the Housing Committee will shift
into high gear and attempt to create
the kind of housing situationthatwlll
satisfy the needs of most Grinnell
students. This should begin soon
after the start of second semester,
according to Jim Tederman, As~
sistant Dean of Student Affairs.

The Housing Committee will use
the questionnaires in its planning
for the sex and composition of halls
next year, in planning tor the most
feasible way to handle room draw,
and in deciding the sort of offs
campus and cooperative housing that
will be oflered. After consultation
with the Black Housing Committee,
the Committee will make Ii recomr
mendation to the Social Policies
Committee, who will then amend the
recommendation it they think it is
necessary, or pass it on to the
Joint Boards. Once obtaining SGA
approval, the proposal goes toPres-
ldent Leggeit’s office for approval.

Although most questionnaires have
not been turned in yet, Tederman
has noticed some definite trends
in those he has received Very few
requests have been made for sin—
glc sex halls, and Tederman pres
diets that next year only two halls,
one tor men and one tor women,
will remain nonrcoeducutionul. ll
college tinances permit, juniors and
seniors will both be allowed to move
in to non-college owned housing.

Decisions about co-ops will be
made after some assessment has
been made of the desire lor that
sort oi option, 'l‘etlernzin comments

number of total cosops will prob-
ably not be increased next year

Department Analyses Successful

by Don Dagenais

Evaluations of the Political Science and Art departments conducted
this semester witli the help oi consultants from outside the college
were termed “highly successful“ this week by Dean oi‘ Adminis-
tration Waldo Walker, The evaluations, whicharepartot le’l attempt
to “assist each department in conducting a thorough sell-study
or its philosophy, obyectives, methods, balance, deployment ol :
teaching faculty, and its uses ct avallableresources,” are expected
to result in specilic proposals tor program revision within the

atlectcd departments.

The idea tor the evaluations, Walker told the sols this week,
originated last Spring as an ellort to institute a “continuing as-
sessment" of academic matters at the college. Each department
is expected to provide belore the beginning of the evaluationa
resume oi |ts program, including such tactors as the instructional
philosophy ol departmental stall, instructional obiectives ol the
department, and the structure 01 the major Following thatpre—

paration,

several consultants with interests in the liberal arts

education chosen by Walker from throughout the country are ins
Vited to campus for 1-1/2 to 2 (litys to interview the instructors
the student EPC, and conduct informal conversations with the stall

and other student mayors.

Each consultant then submits to the department and the admin-

istration a report containing his or her impressions and collcluss
ions concerning the needs ot the department, and lollowing the
departure ol the consultants, members ol the administration dis-
cuss the reports with the members ofthe department and the student
EPC of the department A tinal report is then made by the depart—
ment to the President containing mayor conclusions derived lrom
the analysis and possible changes which may beplanned as a result

ol the study

“The studies include both program and personnel evaluation,”
said Walker, “and are not intended to embarrass the departments
but rather to make constructive criticisms and to get at the root
ol any problems we might have.We havehad outstanding consultants,
who have really gotten into it and enjoyed applying themselves

to that task.”

Analyses such as those conducted already will he pei-lormed tor
the Biology, Psychology, and English departments next semester,
and other departments will be included in subsequent year

Cooperating in the study, based on
the fiscal year 1971-72, were 47
local businesses, realsestateown-
ers, banks, clty manager's office,
county assessor, county auditor,
public school oliicials, and various
college ollices.

Money Spent

0f the $3 million worth of total
spending, the lollowing amounts are
spent by college employees andtheir
families in Grinnell

$570,000 for food and beverages

$280,000 for Clothing and related
items

$225,000 for household goods and

turnishings

tional activities

Money spent by students for local
purchases amounts to more than
$470,000 a year, and visitors to cam»
pus leave about $120,000 in the city,
principally for load and lodging.
Though purchases by SAGA are not
made in Grinnell, the majority ol
food buying is nevertheless done
within the state. In addition, SAGA
employs 40 fullstlmepeople on cams
pus at a gross compensation of
about $180,000.

The college itsell buys almost a
halfsmillion dollars' WOth of goods
and services from local merchants
on a yearly basis. And a total of
$200,000 is paid to local real-es-
tate owners for housing rented to
college employees and to students
living on campus.

Tax Loss Offset

In assessing the ellect ol the col.
lege’s tax-exempt status, the report
shows that the total cost of munis
clpal and public school services to
the college, its employees, and stu»
dents came to $428,899 in 1971-72.
Though the college paid only $2,790
in real»estate taxes on some of its
Grinnell property, there were other
college-related payments and re-
venues to offset the cost of these
serVices.

Sixtysthree per cent olthe college’s
employees own their homes inGrina
hell, and they paid $60,903 in real—
estate taxes on these properties in
1971-72.

In addition, the college made dirs
ect payments tor certainpublic ser»
vices in the amount of $16,514,Also,
allotments to the city from road-
use, school assistance, and other
state funds were $41,344 higherthan
they would have been if there were
no local college population.

The report also notes that the 226
children at college employees (out
of a total school enrollmentof2,614)
accounted for $62,660 of the total
funds granted to the Grinnell public
schools in federal and state aid,

Revenues also came from the mul-
tiplier effects of collegesrelated
buying in the city, includingpropors
tionately higher employment, addis
tional tax dollars, and greater eco-
nomic activity in general.
Purchasing by the college, its em-

fut

pioyees, and students resultsin sig-
nificantly increased business volu-
me which, the report estimates,pro-
duces another 314 jobs in the local
economy at a gross compensation of
$2,018,000, a large portion of which
goes into real-estate and other
taxes,

Also, the survey estimates that lo-
cal merchants in 197142 paid
$84,879 in real-estatetaxes and$40,
336 in non-real-property and inven-
tory taxes on those portions oltheir
business considered to be college—
related.

ln all, the report says that a total
of $345,165 was realized in govern-
mental assistance funds, college-
related property taxes, and other
payments to ollset most ol the$428,
899 estimated as revenue lost be—
cause ol the college's taxsexempt
status.

in commenting onthe report, mem
bers of the administrationnotedthat
the remainder is more than made up
in the additonal economic activity
generated by the presence of the
college.

Other Benefits

In addition to the dollars»anu»cents
impact of the college on the com-
munity, the report lists less tan—
gible but important other lactors.
These include cultural and recreav
tional offerings, most of whichare
free to community residents, as well
as student and employee volunteer
services in many community pro—
grams.

The college also noted that it

President Russ McGregor has re-
fused to accept the resignation of
Michele Conway as Student Auditor
and will make a definite decision
concerning the resignation follow»

“We have not had enough time to
review the Student Auditor position
and Michele’s performance in that
lob," McGregor said. “1 am per~
sonally not convinced that Michele
is doing an inadequate job as Stus

be a loss to the office and to the
entire Student Government Associa-

position,"

Ms. Conway and Assistant Audie

ters ol resignation to McGregorlast
