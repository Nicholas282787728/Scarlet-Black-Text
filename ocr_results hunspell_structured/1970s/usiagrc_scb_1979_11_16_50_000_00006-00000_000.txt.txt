Such a situation slows down inter-

wonder why the phone sometimes

SGA debates Cambodian aid

by Winston Kteutel

“One oi the most important meeting
so far this semester! " was SGA Presi~
dent David Kramer’s comment in
regard to last Wednesday night's stu-
dent government meeting. Along with
the Nov. 8 meeting, the two meetings
determined how to raise funds for the
Cambodian refugees and boat people.
allocated funds to the Grinnell gay
community, as well as a mini-grant,
and passed a revised policy concern-
ing damage and vandalism to common
areas.

Receiving over three hours of
debate between the two meetings was
whether or not, and how, to give
money to the Cambodian refugees and
boat people. The iinal resolutions
were: first, to hold a campus wide
referrendum to determine who would
like to see money donated to the boat
people. The percentage or second
semester pinball receipts which will
be sent will correspond to the percen-
tage oi the people who specified they
did want to see aid given. Second, a
iundraiser oi which proceeds will go to
the Cambodian refugees Via the OX-
FAM Cambodian fund will be Organize
ed on campus.

SGA member Danny Kadden com-
mented on the debate by saying,
“After the meeting it was obvious to
me that people were misiniormed. it
is our job to understand our respon-

Sibility in this matter."

The Committee for Student Life
(CSL) modified Grinnell College's pre-
sent policy concerning damage and
vandalism to common areas at its
Nov. 5 meeting, The modifications
essentially state that any residence
hall which suffers damage or van
dalism will have its funds frozen [or
two weeks. At the end of that two
week period, if the vandals have not
been determined, the bill will be taken
from the halls funds. However, if the
hall has depleted its funds and

thereiore cannot pay, SGA will ioot
the bill, .

The Grinnell gay community receiv-
ed $65 ior gay publications at the Nov.
14 meeting. Though they did not
receive the full $125 they requested,
five magazines concerned specifically
with gay people will be available in
the Student Activities Room.

Finally, a $100 mini-grant was
allocated for ileum-chemical research,
which presently deals with exploring
learning and behavioral processes.
