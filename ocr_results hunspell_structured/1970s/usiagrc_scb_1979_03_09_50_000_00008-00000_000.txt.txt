Sh : What are your qualiﬁcations for
the job of SGA president?

Kranior . . In 1974. Spiro Agnew
resigned lhe vicepresidency oi the United
States not because he vlas guilty. but
because he was mature enough not to put
personal ambition before the welfare of
the people.

Melissa Hopp:

will you serve the

peoples’ interests . . . or your owli'.’ icall on
you to withdraw from the race Nothing
personal. but how could have you known
that both the davidic messiah and the antic
Christ were present on campus and
planning to use this election as a stage ior
their final contmntalion'.’

By asking people to vote for you. you are
asking them to spend eternity in hell, for so
lhe lines are drawn, But enough ior me, I
must be about my father's business, I
commend you into the hands of my
prophets, Chuck Platter and Bob Weiss,
also known as the prophets of the new age
and of the apocalypse.

Yesterday we saw you gather An
eclipse. a passing oi the moon in iront or,
the sun’,’ Not—a sign, yet you defiled it.
Poke a pinhole in cardboard, look through
a lens, throw your last morsels of food to
the Beast and starve yourselves.

You frighten us——what can we do7 Ask
for another sign, pray for another lnot
through your vanity, but for your souls). It
was a year ago that we were shown the
Grail, long silent in Oazaca. Now driving
Route 80 we realize the time: six miles
from Grinnell, 66 from Iowa City, A year
ago; the partaking of the Holy Grail
outside a rude Oaxacan chapel, Today:
Grasshoppers; floods; tornadoes; ear-
thquakes tmy mother, oh God! ); Vietnam

, but stop. Praise the messiah, He has
come!

We are in the last days. No parties. no
JokES, no mufﬂed giggles will ease the
pain: sooner or later it all gets real. The
Beast is here. Our revelation forced Him to
act immediately in a desperate attempt.
Secular apocalypse is his goal for He
knows His fate if the universe is allowed to
came to its term: Armageddon and the»
advent of the millenium. How strange you
will think, how novel But the time has,
come for action, not thought. This is no TV
show and there will be no reruns.

SKtB' What \Hll be the main problems
lacing you as soil presxdent”

Kramer: ll Alcohol policy: Is
marijuana an issue? No! That's because
it's illegal for all, Alcohol was OK for the
Depression; it worked when your
girlfriend committed suicide and It even
pulled you through when your dog lay
spattered on the highwayibut will it cheer
you in the face of the Beast” Will it wash
his mark from your brow" My answer is
morphine, which, conveniently. is illegal
ior everyone and not Just the campus
youngsteis. No hangover cithcr

2) Student Financial Aid. I realize that
you won't have enough money to supply
your own morphine, but don't iret It will
be distributed free. with many other good
things. There’s no point in sitting on top oi
360 million waiting tor thc end. I propose to
liquidate the entire endowment upon my

election! Student referendums will be held
immediately to determine our fiscal
priorities

3) Student input: We are not heard
because we do not speak with power.
Money is power and we will have money.
Faced with the imminence of apocalypse
we Will train ourselves in the art of pillage,
that we might iully exploit the natural
catastrophes that Will befall our ClthS.
There will be earthquakes in Chicago.
floods in Dallas, and volcanoes in New
York, We will follow them and gather
riches (more money ior morphine).

4) Bathroom policy. Faced with the
specifics of Armageddon, we must arm
ourselves and come to the realization that
the more souls that can be brought to our
side, the better for us Now, as J. Teder-
man knows. coed bathrooms will be
virtual spawning grounds for new souls
From these small stalls, great armies W|ll
spring,

5) Presidential vacancy. The Beast
would have us quibbling over secular

issues. but we will not be led astray.
Besides, with the advent of the millenium
and the reign of the Messiah, the college
presidency will be just another titular
position,

. . . I‘ve only held transitory positions
such as Judicial Council, etc, etc, But I
am pure, i am a virgin with a vision,

5&8: Are you really a virgin?

xi-anier: . . . No, I'm not a virgin ..

SBA}: What's your opinion on the ”F"
grade?

Kramer: Hate it . . the apocalypse is
near and it doesn't matter.

SKtB: What about distribution require
ments"

Kramer: We must all be trained in
diilerent departments so that we can, as a
group, come to the understanding that we
must. ‘

5&1 So you support distribution
requirements?

Kramer: No comment,

S&B’ . , ,What will you do if the trustees
decide to tear down Mcars?

Kramer‘ I will tear down the trustees.

SM;- Will dorm renovations be an issue
next year7

Kramer: (If Students protest) .
lead them

5&3: Does the SGA need constitutional
reform?

Kramer: The constitution is illusory
. . . It existsonly in our minds , . . lreform)
is not for the students to decide.

58th: If you are elected, how closely will
you follow your platform?

Kramer: As closely as Moses stood to
Aaron when they got to Israel . Moses
stood on a hill outside of Israel, and Aaron
went into lsrael . or course the person
who Went down to Israel was not
remembered long, but the person who
Stood on thathill has been remembered for
5,000 years

5&8: Is there anything else you would
like to add?

Kramer: I am. as I have always said, a
serious candidate.

8&5: Thank you.

. I will

. .wbile Hopp outlines presidential plans

Junior Melissa Hopp, a history major.

, finished first on Wednesday’s ballot for

SGA president Wednesday night she
answered questions on her campaign for
soil; Associate Editor Dan Flynn.

5&8: What are your qualifications for
the job of SGA preSIdent?

iiopp: One oi the things that ultimately
qualifies me is, that I announced my
candidacy first. which should show that I
have the dedication to do it and I was
pretty certain of it from the beginning

In terms of regular experience, I have a
year as assistant student coordinator and
last year, ior a little overa semester, 1 was
parlimentarian,

sis-l3: Why do you want to be SGA
president7

"opp: Because I feel I can do the best
job, I see problems in the present ad-
ministartion that should be fixed for next
year. And I feel that I‘m the one that‘s able
to do that most eriectively,

sou: What problems do you see in the
presentadmtnistration‘?

Hopp: At times it can be elitist . . .
sometimes it’s not as successful as it
should be. , .I disagree with the way some
issues have been handled. . (there were
problems) Working with the hall
presidents, . ,

SM}: How would you handle these
problems" ,

iiopp. . , I would have . a pre
determined time, probably an hour a day,
at least, that I would be in the office .that
would be the hour I'm always accessablo
, . I would work to have a cabinet diverse
in ideologies and in that Way would reach
diiierent sectors oi the campus . , .

I think the reason the current ad»
ministration wasn‘t as successful as it
should be is. ..student input, or lack of it.
People don’t know what's going on. , once
they iind out what’s going on—ir student
government makes sure they know what's
going onithen the student president is a
more poweriul tigure,

the hall councils. . will make the
presidents and coordinators work as more
of a unit within the hall I plan to get to
know pcrsonally each president . .tlien
there's not as much antagonism within the
body .

sails: t“Student input" is a catchphrase
that has been used in SGA elections for

years, How do you plan to deal with it,

diircrently from presidents in the past?)

ilopp: . .I have an eightrpoint proposal
that tells you how I'm going to increase
student input . I’m telling people
specifically What I want to do. . part of the
reason that people don't want to give input
is because they don't have a feeling that it
makes any difference , , , I intend to
change that. but it's one of these things
that's going to take years. , .to make
people ieel that student government can be
an effective force.

5&8: . . that presupposes that it is an
effective lorcc. ' , '

iiopp: That‘s also a problem with the
faculty and administration, that they don’t

 

take it tstudent government) seriously
enough, , .It's a circle. If student govern
ment is more eirective, people see it as
effective and then it can be more effective
, .Wc’rc worriedabout that initial step

(Also), sometimes they tthe faculty)
see the student leader as much too and
tagonistic—Skip Day is a wonderful
example of that, . ,

tTheway to work with the iaculty) , is
to go towards the key people. . . and to talk
with them in a reasonable manner. ,,

8&8: Your proposal says you will "fight
lor student opinion." Wouldn’t that cause
the antagonistic atmosphere you allude
to?

Hopp: . , There's a difference between
fighting and antagonizing. . I can light for
student opinion by being very adament
about it, .without making the faculty feel
like it’s being threatened,

58th: Your proposal mentions
referendums; would you elaborate on
that”

Ilnpp: ,. Joint Board only has a certain
voice as a representative body. tJoint
Board can pass a resolution) . . but that
resolution only has so much weight,
whereas a student referendum has even
more weight . referendums are only
going to be evoked on important issues. . .

SM}: Your platform says Joint Board
resolutions will be used more effectively,
How?

Hopp: We've passed two resolutions
this semester. . .I think there are other
places where student input should be lelt,
and it‘s not felt. . .Bcsides just passing
that resolution . . . the president has to go
and personally bring that resolution to the
chairman of the faculty, and present the
reasoning behind it.

SﬂiB: Let's talk about some specific
“issues". , What about student protests in
regard to the “1“” grade?

"opp: I think a student demonstration
or protest should come While the faculty is
considering it. .

SK'B: Distributional requirements?

llopp: I’m strongly against them, I
would support a demonstration, and
depending on the sentiment, probably a
strike In addition to the demonstrations
and the Strikes I would also be in there
personally discussing it, and ex-
pres ing student opinion. ,

5M1: Alcohol”

IIlipp: If I know about laundering of
funds, I will stop it I think the "End of
tlic World Party set an excellent
precedent for the kind oi alcohol party that
should become lhe norm , .

5&Bi Should the current policy lthat no
funds may be used tor the purchase of
alcohol) be changed”,

»llopp: .I‘ll support tthe current
policy).

584K: . . What if the trustees decide to
tear down Mears?

"opp: . . (I'd) work through, . .official
channels to express disapproval of it, and
if that has no effect, We'll go to student
demonstrations.

5&8: Your platform mentions Student
Affairs lines against dorms What exactly
is your concern and proposal in this area?

Mom): The manner in which the halls are
fined is bad. .l‘The money is taken first
from hall funds, and then Student Affairs
sends a letter to the hall coordinator
saying that ii the person responsible tor
the damage is identified, the money will be
returned). . .that kind of authoritarian
stance is really obnoxious,

.(Student Affairs) should send a bill
first. . .those three fines (specified in the
handbook). we’re pretty much obligated to
pay because it's a kind of student cone
tract . ,

San: What about nonspecified fines?

iiopp: . . .Those kind of things we’re not
obligated to pay , . it should be dealt with
as the administration asking for payment,
not as an obligation . , .

5&8: Should the line policy he changed
tto include vandalism)?
llopp: . At present, no.

 

.4 a

. , What about CSL structure?

, . .There should be a clause that
two-thirds of Joint Board can remove a
CSL member. , .

5&8: .what do you ioresee as issues
next year? _

llop The whole problem of the
renovations oi the dormsithe way the
renovations are donkstudcnts seem to be
very concerned. . . CSL will come up again

, the Health Center , . . is a continuing
problem . .

The bookstore thing. .(Bookstore
manager Thomas McBeel is still feeling
out the market for used books at
Gl'lnnell . . .

Constitutional reform, , . we have a real
nice constitution Sitting in the office that
was not signed. because of one phrase
dealing with CSL . Assuming that we're
able to change CSL Structure (it will
probably pass)

5&11: Would you like to add anything?

"opp: , . .No.

son: Thanks ior your time.

flopp: Thank you.
