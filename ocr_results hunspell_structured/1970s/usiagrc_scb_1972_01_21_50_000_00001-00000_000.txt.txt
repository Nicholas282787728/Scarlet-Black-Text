Faculty Debates Debate,-
Makes Freshmen Eligible

by Anne Walter

Discussion at the first faculty
meeting of the semester Monday af-
ternoon was primarily devoted to
the related problems of why faculty
meetings are sparsely attended.and
how business should be accomr
plished by the faculty.

Only one item of business was
completed. The faculty passed a
Midwest Conference athletic pror
posal to allow ireshmen players on
the football and basketball teams and
to allow schools to setup a rather
limited Junior Varsity Program,
Seven of the ten conference schools
must ratify this proposal for it to go
into effect; reportedly three have at-
ready decided to vote against it.

The Faculty Organization Commit-
tee proposed to change faculty rules
so that a quorum be redefined as 45
voting members, rather than 2 ma
jority, as under current rules, The
present quorum rule was instituted
last fall to insure that a reasonable
percentage of the faculty act on
major legislation.

The rule has onen hampered action
because quorum calls have been

made just prior to votes; usually a
quorum has been absent atter 5:30
pm,

The Faculty Organization Commit-
tee’s proposal would probably make
the occurrence of a quorum more
frequent by reducing the number re-
quired for a quorum from about 56
to 45 voting members or the faculty.

in the faculty’s discussion, several
people suggested that a quorum be
defined at the discretion ofthe chair,
or that there be no quorum rule. It
was noted that the quorum is only
necessary if someone calls for it,
and that this procedure may be
overused.

Another means of solving the prob-
lem of getting business done was
suggested by Henry Klein, Art. He
proposed that a faculty senate he
created and that it be empowered to
carry out faculty legislation.

The central question in the dis
cussion following Mr. Klein’s mar
tion was how faculty meetings can
be improved so that more profes-
sors attend and so that business is
accomplished.

Many faculty expressed dissatis-

Proposes Faculty Senate

Henry Klein, Art, suggestedacom-
prehensive taculty reorganization
proposal at Monday’s faculty meet
ing, proposing that a faculty Senate
be formed and empowered to carry
out the major legislative business of
the faculty.

Mr. Klein believes that a senate
would work more efficiently and
effectively than the faculty now does,
since it would be a smaller body and
it would be composed ofrepresentar
lives with a definite constituency.

The new senate would have the fol-
lowing criteria:

1. The senate would have the same
powers as the faculty now has.

2. There would be representatives
from each division and group cur-
rently holding iaculty voting status
(including library, P E depart
ment).

3. Everyone with faculty standing
would be eligible for the senate.

4. The senate would hold open meets
ings.

Council Reiecis ACM Program

by John Wylie

Executive Council action during
Christmas break included decisions
rejecting a proposed ACM Black
College in favor Of Grinnell's own
programs; rejecting oi a proposed
establishment of a department of
Religious Studies; and considering
the reintroduction of a certification
program in elementary education

ACM’S Black College proposal,
first made public in April of 1971,
would have established a Black Stu-
dies program occurring in part on
the individual campuses and in part
at a central headquarters, probably
Chicago, The Council decided that
Grinnell could better meet the needs
of its Black students with its own
programs, and thus it rejected the
proposal.

Dean of Administration Waldo Wale
ker indicated that the cost tothoCol-
lege of entering such a program
could be conservatively estimated at
$50,000.00 and that the Collcgc could
not afford this in addition to the costs
of developing its own programs.

ACM Terminates Program

Citing the impossibility of finding
a corps of Black teachers to move
from campus to campus,prohll)itive
cost, and the existence of individual
programs at the member colleges,
the ACM Board unanimously res
jected further consideration of the
program at its January meeting.

5. Complete minutes, including the
arguments and voting on significant
issues would be distributed to the
entire faculty.

6. Any action may be reconsidered
by the entire faculty at the request
of any ten members within a two-
week period following distribution of
the minutes.

7 Any action approved by the fac—
ulty (as opposed to the senate) must
be approved by a majority of the
entire faculty.

The senate, Klein believes, should
have time to take up more inter-
esting and critical issues, such as
longrrange planning and admissions
policy.

Mr Klein also feels that the con-
stant meddling ofthe faculty in areas
where committees have responsi—
bilities is not helpful, and that com»
mlttees dealing with such things as
the library and publications should
be given full responsibilities ior
their areas of expertise.

Only Ripon College expressed any
real interest in the program, and
then only it outside funding was
available. It is not.

The Council’s action is rejecting
a proposal to create a department of
religious studies merely avoids cre—
ating another administrative divi-
sion, Dean Walker noted that the
decision did not cut back the Re-
ligious Studies program in any way.
He noted that the trend in college
administration today is to combine
programs under broader departe
mental labels as an economy mea-
sure.

Columbia Law Program

The Council approved Grinnell‘s
participation in a Columbia Univer-
sity Law program which would allow
up to two students per year to begin
graduate work in law during what
would normally be their Senioryear
at Grinnell. Upon completion oftheir
first year at Columbia, their Grin-
nell undergraduate degree would
also be awarded.

Final action has not yet been taken
on several other matters brought
before the Council for consideration.
One is the reinstatement of the cer—
tirication program in elementary
education. The other concerns prOA
posed changes in the Credit/Fail
grading system. Mr, Paarslow has
put one proposal betore the faculty,
and others are expected.

faction with their meetings last
semester. Some considered most
faculty business trivial compared to
broader issues that affect the whole
campus. Some complained that
meeting time was taken up by spec—
ial reportseeinformation rather than
legislation. A number of faculty ads
vocated faculty input on the agenda
for these reasons.

Most faculty members seemed to
believe that there has been too much
legislating on the floor of the meet

. ings. Committees have often worked

out proposals in advance only to have
detailed changes made at the meet-
ings; thus, the committee structure
is orten by-passed by this process.

The institution ofa cloture rule was
suggested as a means or curtailing
tedious discussion. it was also sug-
gested that meetings be called to
order promptly at 4:15 and that a
policy of limited debate go into
effect after 5:30 and a prompt close
ing at 6:00.

Guillermo Mendoza, Biology come
merited on the failure of the faculty
to recognize the substance of a pro-
posal while attending to the fine de-
tails of wording and punctuation. He
also felt that the faculty was Spread-
ing itself too thin, and that it should
concern itself with teaching and the
sure itself ofa very competent pres-
ident and (lean to do the administrae
tive work.

The proposal to make a quorum 45
percent of the voting faculty will be
distributed by mailboxes for a vote.
(There was not a quorum present at
Monday’s meeting, and Mr. Klein
called tor a count.)

Democrats To Meet,
Select Delegates

The political season opens officiv.
ally this Sunday, when interested.
students and faculty members Willi
meet in thegSouth Lounge to discuss
their role “in the Democratic pre»
cinct Caucuses. The caucuses, which
will begin at 3:00 Monday evening,
are the first step in the process of
delegate selection for the Democrae
‘tic National Convention.

Anyone over seventeen who fulfills
the residency requirements of the
state can participate, To vote in lowa
one must have lived 6 months in the
state, 30 days in the county and 10
days in the precinct, Most upper-
classmen could probably fulfill these
requirements, according to C. Edwin
Gilmour. Political Science. Alan
Jones, History and American
Studies, Said that participation in the
caucuses “Should probably repre
sent a commitment” to vote in the
precinct next tall.

in addition to electing delegates to
the county convention, participants
in the caucuses will choose one com-
mitteeman and one committeewoman
to serve on the Poweshiek County
Democratic Central Committee.

All campus residents are in the
First Ward; whose boundaries are
Penrose, sth avenue, the alley be
tween Broad and Main to 11th avenue,
then West to Hiway 146. The rest of
Grinnell north of 6th avenue is the
Second Ward. The remaining wards
are south or 6th avenue; Fourth Ward
is to the east and Third Ward to the
west of the alley between Main and
Broad Streets.

Locations for the caucuses: First
Ward-~Beryl Clotfelter residence,
1421 61h Avenue; Second Ward--
Bailey Park School; Third and
Fourth Wards-~Davis School.

lowa’s system for electing dele—
gates to the Democratic National
Convention is virtually a model
under the Party's new procedures.

Delegates elected at the caucuses
will attend a county convention and
elect delegates to the state conven-
tion. Delegates to the state conven-
tion will elect delegates to the Na-
tibna Convention. These delegates
will choose the candidates for Presi—
dent and Vice President in the na~
tional election.

A proportional representation plan,
which is used throughout the system,
is a key to the selection process.
Any candidate who receives 15% or
more of the vote at one of the early
meetings should receive that same
(or approximate) percentage ofdelee
gates to the next higher meeting

In theory, the proportional reprer
sentation formula means that in the
end the share of delegates to the
national convention won by each
candidate will be the same as he
captures at the opening, little prer
cinct caucuses.

For this reason, the national press
will be looking closely at the lowa
precinct caucuses Monday; they will
be the first clue to the grass roots
strength of the major candidates,

The Republican caucuses will not
be held until April 4.

Tuition To Increase $150

Tuition and room lees per student
will increase by a total ofslso for
the academic ycar 1972.73.

The college’s comprehensive too
will thus go up from $3,700 per year
to $3,350 This covers all regular
charges, including tuition, board,
room, health services, student acti-
vines fee, and admission fee [or
college events,

Trustees of the college approved
the new charges in the face ofrising
costs in personnel, operations, and
services. Dean of Administration
Waldo S. Walker Said that the in-
crease is “the most equitable ad»
justment we can make and still
maintain high quality in our in-
structional program."
