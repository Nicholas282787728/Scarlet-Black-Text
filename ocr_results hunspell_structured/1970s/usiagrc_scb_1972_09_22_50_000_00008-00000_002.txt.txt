Dogs yelp

As the midnight train

Pulls through the yards acrossthe street
Rumbling

Dragging the earth along behind it

To a new destination

Further south.

One afternoon in April, we made love.

That surely was no miracle, for we

Had touched belore, in the purple hours oi
Long nights, when shadow set our trembling free,

In candlelight, in starlight and in dark

We came to know each other, slowly grown
To sureness from our hesitating start;

Together, train our mutual alone,

Marty lker

Yet with spontaneious joy DI love sunlit,
An implosion of once paralyzed time,
Our knowledge opened further, to admit
A union unafraid oi its design
Etched bold in spectrum out across twilight,
Never again need our love hide in night.

Miss Hypo’s Geritol Waltz

Each day grows larger while her breath gets shorter.
Surely this stitch in her side is a recent thing!
Forget iresh air Next time she’ll take the bus.

(How many next times?) Joints hat crack and alone,

The summer passes endlessly in dream
Beyond the common song oi golden skies.
isolated in what otherwise
Might be a ioy, ii there were only means
To populate the emptiness oi eyes,
The summer passes endlessly in dream.
Beyond the common song oi golden Skies
There is a slow lament whose sobbing seems
To come irom solitude. The casual ties
That iiold the world together as it lies
At mercy~ol the seasons’ hostile stream
Dissolve, beiore they even realize
The summer passes endlessly in dream
Beyond the common song oi golden skies

scouring my scattered pulses
rihoons ot magnesium delight delicately

madly

play upon me from her skinned grape eyes
strumming unrealized strings

unlatchlng sunwish windows

she smiles and ilames

loving my every refraction

evergreen wonder

company for the cold against the iools

eggroom wasteland

the Falcon wheezes But its last days in the sun
Ira Aronin

A rusty hinge but with what all to treat?
iier glands are dead. Forget, iorget it all
But how the sly, insistent pain? The doubts
Like cancer spread, are eating her alive

Small volumes by modern poets
Cool green covers, tasteiul titles, moderately priced
i have read them

They are current, they are pleasant
out
like an old, sad nympho,
l was waiting to he pierced
And it never came,
Sue Ol'ingel

war zone

l'm not sure
where the guoiire come irom
late at night in Iowa
I hear it only then,
stereos and television
I suppose,
but I know when
the bombing started,
I can hear another one ticking,
I'm about to blow up!
and
hell with it
there’s not enough death
among the cornstalks
for a whispered no
to grow.

Sue Orlngel

On My Way to Portland. Five an,

inside the river Columbia
enclosed in an animal
membrane

impermiable to all but light
iionting, driiting, dragging
with the irresistable
illusions of something beyond
striated current

sinewy muscle ot river,
caught thee in the impulse
of lncessant flex

alone, as in the night
when the rain Contacts
the window with tight lists;
tailing train the heights
at the gourge (the start
oi consciousness in my sleep);
the threatening mists of the
Sound: the kelp
strangulation DI the animated-
all this, this fear
driving my cniiin ever
deeper
driving me to the turbulence
of the involuted conﬂict
where river meets sea
and implosion explodes
all form
S. 'I‘ Wellman
