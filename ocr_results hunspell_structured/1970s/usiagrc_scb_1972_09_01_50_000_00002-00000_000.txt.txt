ISPIRG Philosophy

Student protest movements of the past have had the distinct
advantage of having been unorganizedVocal leaders emerged,
of course, and mass meetings had a tendency to take place,
but few organizations were formed specifically for the pur~
pose of making their influence on social issues felt for any
period of time.

For the students involved, this lack of continuity was not
all bad. Indeed if one had little permanent impact one also
had little permanent responsibility.

That philosophy while possessing obvious advantages for
those not really committed to a lengthy drive for social
change, has become as outdated as the Freedom Rides
and sit-in demonstrations themselves. The publicity was gained,
attention was drawn, the protest made; but although some
advances were felt, the real objects of such tacticse-whether
they be equality for blacks and whites or an end to the war
or even an overthrow of the government-were never realized.
We have done the easy part. Now something more forceful,
more permanent, more powerful is needed. The recent growth
of the state Public Interest Research Groups is a response
to the new need.

The idea of the vPIRGs is almost embarrassingly simple:
students are willing to put their money and time where their
mouths have been. Thus they will be willing to form a per,
manent organization for social change in the public interest.
If each college student in a particular state would be willing
to contribute $1 or $3 a year, the theory goes,that would
mean thousands of dollars per year per state which could
be used to form an organization staffed by professionals
which could work in a politically powerful way.

The political philosophy is strict balance—of—power. The
individual needs power in order to counteract effectively the
power held by the non-public-interest—oriented organizations
in the society: business, some branches of government, the
media, and etc. Thus, according to the philosophy, we need
an organization funded and ruled by the individuals themselves-—
with professional assistance, of course--and this organization
will be big enough to match punches with the best of them.
An organization responsible to the masses, operating in the
public interest. The idea certainly is not new: the authors
of the American Constitution seem to have had something
similar in mind nearly two hundred years ago. The American
brand of Republicanism, however, must not have worked,
according to the ePIRG theory, for if it had there would be
no need for ISPIRG.

The problem of ISPIRG and its fellows must be to make
itself more responsive to the individual than is the govern-
ment, or else it will have stronger a claim to represent the
“public interest" than will the representatives sitting in the
legislatures. The process by which this is to be done remains
unclear.

Further problems may be created by the nature of the or-
ganizational arrangement. A group of professional lawyers,
researchers, and lobbyists will be hired to “assist“ and to
“advise" the board of students governing the organization.
One finds it difficult to imagine that such a staff would fail
to exercise a bit of power of its own. In fact, it may even—
tually become, if unwittingly, the director and instigator of
ISPIRG actions rather than the assistant and the follower of
the students.

These difficulties are not the only troublesome parts of the
theory, however. The most obvious has not everbeen mentioned:
the fact that the organization is student-run and student
controlled. If we take on the one hand that ISPIRG operates
in the “public interest” and on the other hand that it is run
by the college crowd, then the only logical conclusion must
be that the college crowd holds dear to its collective heart
the ”public interest,”

Although we are not ready to categorically deny that premise
here (no survivalroriehted college editor could be), the as-
sumption is a major one and should be closely examined for
its truth value. What, we should ask, gives us the right to
speak for the many individuals in the society? Perhaps we
should be more truthful and advertise ISPIRG as only the
"voice, of the students” rather than the "voice of the people."

ISPIRG, then, has its holes. It is not perfect, not the answer
to any dreams. But in a time of trauma for the student move-
ment, it is much closer to the “answer” for which we all seek
than anything else in view.

The real question is Are we ready for this much of a come
mitment to social activity? Has the student movement thus
far been only the bawl of the brat, or is it ready to toss away
the rattles and begin to grow up? If it is, then ISPIRG and its
brothers may be the next step to take in the long climb to
power.

Yearbook Woes

T0 the Editors:

When I ordered a ‘72 yearbook,
I was expecting pictures of all my
classmates and profs. Instead, I
received a yearbook which reflected
d split of opinion within the year
book staff.

Our sophomore editor, Neal Trar
bisch, believed that the yearbook
should have little or no emphasis
on seniors over other classes. He
did not want a picture of every
senior, taken in the usual, stuffy,
senior picture tradition, resulting
in an aesthetically inferior year-
book.

I believed that all seniors andprofs
should appear in the yearbook, ex-
cept those who requested to be
omitted. Accordingly, I submitted
about 75 shots of seniors and profs,
a third of which were used, In pho-
tographing seniors, I asked each one
what setting and action would be
most typical of them.

I photographed actors acting,
singers singing, athletes athleting
and lab people peering through mic-
roscopes. Even if photographing
every senior did mean an occase
ional lessrthan—exciting picture, I
personally prefer to have a complete
record of my class to look at when
I am a greyrhaired old lady.

Many seniors who knew 1 had
photographed them asked me why

their picture did not appear inghe
yearbook. Except in two cases where

I bumbled the photography, Ihad
to tell these people that the editor
had chosen not tolncludethem. They
were hurt,

I realize that our Staff and budget
were limited. And I certainlyam not
against using pictures of under-
classmen if these are newsworthy.
But I think that all printable shots
of seniors should have been used.
And I see no excuse for printing
two or three shots of the same
person, when space IS at apremium.

Our editor even went so far as
to use a shot of a New York con-
struction site which happened to be
a roll of senior pictures that I
submitted!

I say all this only so that the class
of ”73 will be more informed when
this year’s editor is chosen.

Conway Replaces Hart

bynn sun slnu vine.»

Michele Conway has been appointed
to the position of Student Auditor
for the current academic year, the
student Coordinator's office an—
nounced Monday. She will take the
place of Loren Hart, who resigned
form the office this summer, as
reported in last week’s S&E.

In his letter of resignation to Stu~
dent Government Association Pres—
ident Russ McGregor earlier in the
year Hart had recommended Michele
for the position. Last Sunday evening
at a meeting of the SGA executive
board Hart reaffirmed the recome
mendaticn. John Mead, the present
Assistant Auditor, had informed SGA
that he was not interested in the
Chief Auditor position,

Michele was the Secretary to the
Auditor two years ago under Audi
itor Rick Deyo andhasbeenfamiliar
with the workings of the office for
several years Because of her eke
perience she will be “easier to train
then somebody new," Hart told the
5&3. “I knew She was interested,
and lnterestis important. I also knew
she was competent, and competence
is important."

Hart has been on campus for the
past few days to assist in thetrans-
fer to a new Auditor, He will leave
on September 1 for Columbia Uni—
versity where he will attend Law
School.

The Auditor’s office is responsible
for controlling the funds which go
to student government-funded or-
ganizations, As a result it handles
nearly $70,000 a year. The halls,
radio station KDIC, the SocialCoorv
dinating committee, the son lnili-
ﬂiiveACultural Fund, and other stu-
dent-sponsored activities deal fre-
quently with the Student Auditor,

The problem in finding someone
to fill the position, according to
Hart, is “the trust factor." A great
deal of money passes through the
office, and "in the three years I
have known the office we have never
lost a penny. In a job like this you
become committed .50 you feel
that you have a tradition to uphold
You want to pass on the office to
someone you know is competent and
trustworthy You can recommend
onl people you know and trust.“

MICHELE CONWAY

Hart instituted a new bookkeeping
program during the 1972 Spring
semester which Michele will retain
during the coming year.

“I hope people will bear with me
through the difficulties during these
first few weeks," she told the 5&3.
Every student Organization, she also
noted, should appoint a specific
member as treasurer to dealwnh the
Auditor’s office so as to simplify
ttie question of who can and cannot
take out money for the organization.
Only hall presidents and vice—prose
dents can check out hall funds.

OUTLIN ES
SAGA POLICY

by Bill Glaser

In order to eliminate waste and pro»
vide for better food service, Jerryl
Ramaker, head of Saga at Grinnell,
has outlined several new diningpol-
icies for the coming year.

One of the new policies is the
“take one and come back for more"
policy. Under this policy, students
are allowed to have only one ser~
ving of food to start out with but
may obtain unlimited portions at the
second's cart. The only exception
to this rule is on Saturday night
when only one entree is available
for each student.

Next, Ramaker feels that his new
“bus your own” policy will pro—
vide a more pleasant eating atmos-
phere because mess and cluttered
tables will be eliminated. He asks
for cooperation with this new policy
and requests that students bearwith
him for the mild inconvenience it will
cause.

Mr. Ramaker asks that students
follow another new policy of taking
no food out of the dining room.
He says that “if students eat all
they take in the dining room and take
no food from the dining rooms we
can control costs and provide a
better food service.”

Starting Wednesday August 30, new
extended hours for both dining rooms
will be posted in conspicuous places.
Ramaker hopes that these extended
hours will eliminate long lines. He
also emphasizes the importance of
carrying one’s ID. card to all meals.

Other new policies include the eli-
mination of sitrdown dinners, for-
mation of another food service com-
mittee, and having three monthly
Special events. Ramaker also anti-
cipates that the need for student
labor should not go down this year.

The food service committee acts
as a liason between students and the
food service to help establish better
food service. Anyone interested in
serving on this committee should
sign up with the Student Government
Association.

Ramaker thinks that the special
events will help break the monotony
of college eating. He plans to have
a monthly sandwich buffet, picnics,
organic meals, international din-
ners, and other culinary delicacies.

In conclusion, Mr. Ramaker is an-
xious to point out that Saga is the
students' food service and “we’re
here to serve the students". He
welcomes constructive criticism
and suggestions. Students should
feel free to either write their sug-
gestions or questions on the suggesv
tion boards in the dining rooms
or visit Jerry Ramaker, Rick Brooke
land,Cowles Manager, or Bob Komv
shak. Quad Manager.

Crisis of Identity

He then turned to the question of
the college philosophy, "This face
ulty has already worked its way
through a reevaluation of many of
the Older assumptions about the na-
ture of the curriculum to a new
curricular policy with reasonably
well articulated assumptions and ray
tlonales. But on many of the other
aspects of our theory of the modern
liberal arts college, and Grinnell
in particular, we have now no come
mon understanding, and the result
is an identity crisis."

Because of changes in such things
as the number of people going to
graduate schools, the percentage of
students interested in vocationally-
oriented training, and theprullferar
tion of offrcnmpus programs, the
college is puzzled. ”We sense that
conditions have changed so that the

old dogmatic attitudes may not be
appropriate, but we have not re-
placed them with attitudes bound to-
gether into a self-consistent view of
the nature and role of the college.”
The combination of outmoded attie
tudes concerning residency require—
ments, the type of work for which
the college should be giving credit
and the limitation of offrcampus
study has “restricted the ability of
students to get work experience or
any other sort of non-academic
experience during the course of their
college careers in order to help
choose their lifetime career goals."
As a suggested change in policy,
Clotfelter recommends that the col—
lege should establish a permanent
admissions policy “under which stu»
dents once admitted would be free
to come or go at will until they
graduated or were dismissed,"
Last Word

In closing out his two-year ser»
vice as Chairman of the Faculty,
Clotfelter left behind one warning:
“The faculty must be on guard
against ‘dollar»educatlonal policy’

the deciding of educational policy
queshons on the hosts of finan-

cial benefit to the institution. , . .
I anticipate n greatertendencyinthe
future to try to make educational

policy conform to fiscal needs, and
this the faculty must resist Rules
about transfer credit, residence re—
quirements, and off-campus experr
fences must be made so far as

possible to mnximize the educational
benefit to the student rather than
the tuition income to the college.”
