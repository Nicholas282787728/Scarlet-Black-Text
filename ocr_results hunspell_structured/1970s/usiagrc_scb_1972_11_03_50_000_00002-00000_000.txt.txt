Kintner Views Faculty Role

by Merl-y Wiesner

The iaculty, in the eyes oi [acuity
chairman Philip Klntner, must con-
cern itself with the substantive is-
sues oi teaching and the iunction
oi the college and play a yiial part
in the evaluative process set on
earlier this year by President Leg-
gett. Kintner feels iaculty commit-
ment to self-evaluation to be a ne-
cessary accompaniment to the
professional evaluation which all
departments Will be undergoing
during the next several years,

The oitice oi iaculty chairman
”acts as a clearinghouse for ideas
and problems", providing a voice
in all committees with a Faculty,
rather than administrative bias,
Klntner sees his role as one of an
ombudsman, channeling ideas from
all members of the faculty to tie
termine policy.

There seems to be an inherent
departmental outlook which the face
ulty chairman hopes to overcome,
although interdepartmental Coors
dination is diiiicult on many is—
sues, as each discipline has its own
methods and preferences, Objec-
tivity is oiten hard to come by,
for, as Kintncr noted, he has more
Contact with Certain members of

the faculty and so may take on some
of their idividual perspectives, Kintr
ner sees his Own bias as that of
the laclllty member, concerned with
specifically educational objectives
and the improvement oi teaching,

Dean Walker is now working with
groups or faculty from all divisions
to determine and enunciate teaching
standards, hoping to present these
issues ior all campus discussion
latter in the year, Along with this,
Kintner sees the necessity oi each
department’s clearly defining the
kind oi student that it is trying to
prepare, and a greater acceptance oi
a flexible, interdepartmental ma-
301-.

There are limitations however,
Kilitner feels, on the desirability of
a totally integrated curriculum,
Questions of the validity oi each
discipline's speciiic methods and
objectives must continue to beasked.

, as each department determine’s the

limits or ﬂexibility which it ieels
would be benciicial. nny evaluar
tion, Kintnei- notes, must not be
seen as tinal, tor one cannot codiiy
a particular style oi education he-
tore that style becomes obsoletc.
The question “Education forwnat'J”
demands constant answering.

i‘icular activities, tittiticularly ads
Initiislri’ttive committees llC wel-
comes the acceptance oi the library
staff as official members of the

division, as burgeoning student use
of the library necessitates the staff’s
being given a recognized voice in

Although the ever—present busy
signal on his office telephone would
seem to deny it, Kintiier feels that
their has been less flow of com-
munication from all members of
the faculty than he would like to
see. He senses a reluctancetobring

from The Smoke-Filled Room

Faculty vs. SGA

by Mike Breed

Last week the Joint Board passed
a resolution calling tor a boycott
of classes on election day. This call
was made largelybecause ottlietac-
tical necessities of the McGovern
campaign. it also, however, repre~
sented an important slap at the lace
ulty by the Jomt Board.

For the past three or [our years
students have had the upper hand
in decisions such aswhetherclasses
would be held on election day or not,
Student Voice on such matters was
heard and for the most part heeded.
This semester student voice ill co 7
lege government seems to have lost
all momentum: the faculty has been
content to listen to students and then
go on their merry way, in a large
part ignoring the student leaders.

This time the response by the Joint
Board, to call ior a class boycott,
is understandable, Students mustas-
sert their position in the governance
oi the college,

Faculty Executive Committee
reaction to the boycott call by SGA
is typical of the new order, In a
special meeting held this week they
considered rescinding the mech-
anism the faculty had approved to
tacilitate make-up oi classroom
work missed that Tuesday, but de—
cided instead to issue the statement
appearing in this week’s Campus
Memo.

All this is peripheral to the main
issue at stake, which is getting Mos
Govern elected, Whatever attitude
you have towards the faculty's action
”whether you want to say you are
boycotting classes or you want to
make arrangements to make up the
work laterult is absolutely neces-
sary to get out and work ior Mc-
Govern on election day,

CIA Agent Queries Kagnn

by Don Dagenais

,, The investigation oi two students
by FBI agents on campus last week
was not the only such incident in
recent days, Assistant Protessor oi
History Richard Kagan haslntormed
the state. During that same week a
representative oitheCentrallntelli-
geiice Agency contacted Kagaliinhis
oiiice here at the College toask him
about a trip Kagan had supposedly
made to the People's Republic oi
China.

The agent, Thomas Webber oi the
CIA’s oiiice in Des Moines,
approached Kagantoinquirewhether
someone named Kagan had visited

China earlier in the year. ”Yes,”

he said
“Evidently,” Kagnn told the 5&3
this week, “he knew that someone
named Kagan had gone to China, and
he thouglii it was me.” liiactuality
the traveler was Leigh Kagan, his
wiie, who spent iive weeks in China
in March and April oi this year,
“But, being male cliauviiiistic, this

did not occur to him.”

The agent asked Kagan tew iurther
questions about China. l'ledid,how-
ever, remain in Kagan's oiiice
otttce another hour and ten minutes
while the two debated their view—
points of various CIA activites, and
the propriety oi the present inves-
tigation.

Webber declined Kagan’s invitar
tion to meet with otherfaculty mem-
bers or students, and also refused
to give Kagan his phone number
since it is an unlisted Des Moines
number, After a period of discusy
ion, however, he did agree to leave
his number “if I promised nottotell
anybody else.”

The incident, Kagan told the SibB,
was “disturbing” in that he dis-
approves oi the activities of the CIA
in general. Nonetheless he was tas»
cinated with the psychology or the
agent who, he said, appeared to he
genuine in his belief that he was
patriotically upholding the Consti-
tution oi the United States

PROGRESSIVE: 1. Adj. Moving forward; on going. 2. Noun. A person
who favors or strives for reform in politics or education.

Blll VANDERPOOl

IS THE PROGRESSIVE
CANDIDATE FOR

STATE REPRESENTATIVE
IN THE 7151 DISTRICT

 

Admittedly, McGovern has his iaile
ings, and i know that many people,
while they will vote for him, don’t
think that it is worth the trouble
to work for him Nonetheless, a
quick look at Nixon will perhaps
help to change minds on this issue.

First of all, one must remember
who was President (it seems so long
ago) zit the time when the murders
were committed at Kent State and
Jackson State. And, of course, re-
member the invasion of Cambodia,
which triggered the initial demons
strations.

We have to remember that it was
Nixon who mined Haiphong harbor
last spring-ran action which sent
us marching back into the streets
again, But most importantly, wejust
have to take a look at what news
comes day after day out oiWashing»
ton. An AP. article in Wednesday's
Des Moines Register is a prime
example.

The story, which made the front
page oi the Register, was about
a “secret White House study"which
planned a central communications
system, controlled by the govern—
ment, which supposedly would be a
means oi dispensing disaster warn-
ing iniormation and "a wide vars
iety of services and information“.
What this means is that the governe
merit could have a propaganda macs
hine in every house.

Now, the Nixon administration de-
nies this up and down, just as it
has denied having knowledge of the
Watergate alfalr. The point is that
this kind or planning goes on in
Nixon’s administrationeehe’s that
kind oi man-rand McGovern is not
that kind of man.

McGovern can carry town it he
gets enough workers out; he can
win the election if he gets enough
election day support around the nae
lion There is no excuse for any
student to be in class on election
day~-we have too much at stake
in getting McGovern elected.

By the way, the Joint Board met
this week. They agreed to ask the
Trustees for a small raise in the
activity iund, and they passed guide-
lines for the Treasurer. They spent
hours haggling over the guidelines
{or the Student Auditor's Office
but reached no conclusion.

Peace Panels

The Peace Collective is planning

an aiternoon oi workshops, panel
discussions and a dinner on Fri-
day, November 3, The panel dis—
cussions, which will form the basis
ior the subsequent workshops, will
begin at 4:30 pm. in Gardner
Lounge.

Tile central theme oi the program
is the war in li'tdochina. The Peace
Collective feels that even Should a
ceaseenre occur before the elec-
tiOIiS, larger and more iundamentai
issues raised by the war will Still
persist. Panel presentations will
therefore deal with problems that
are acute and dominant in the pre—
sent conflict in Southeast Asia bill
which also have wider ramifications

ior America’s ioreign policy and
tuture.

Both students and taculty are par-
ticipating in the program, including
Richard Kagan, Richard Hyde, Leigh
Kagan, and Barry Zigas Workshops
and smalidiscussion gl'oupswill {01—
low the briei presentations.

At 6.00 pm. the Collective is spon—
soring a dinner oi home—baketlbread
and cheese in Gardner Lounge. it
is hoped that discussions will be
able to continue through dinner. stu-
dents will also have an opportunity
to meet and speak with Mr John
Tapscott—-Paul Franzeiibul'g's ops
ponent in the Democratic primary
ior Governor in Ibwzinand Mrs.
Peg Mullen, Iowa peace activist.
