The Doppelt Effect——

Out Of The Frying Pan And?

by Jack Doppelt

There is nothing like being away
rpm the homogeneously rinti—war-
l'inliell campus (luring the “gravest
nterulitional crisis" since ttle Cil-
ian missile ultimatum.

I know that anything less earthy
hattering would remain oblivious to
ill of its ill the isolated, communi-
'atiun-iess “terminal"

This is Tuesday night. By now 800
tudents at Grinnell have respond
(I in the habitual and probably nec
essary meetings and marches, and
cattered nnti-warrers throughout
he country have been arrested.
Not me. I missed President Nixon’s
peech, but I’m far from uninformed
uriously, I’m more informed, more
ritense and more scared (for the
first time) than ever before.
Yesterday I was at a funeral"
Jesus, I’m not even liutning ior
ymbolism, My relatives all had the
eath or my uncle (in their minds,
ure, but just as evident and in the
ame morose undertone was the
iockading of Haiphong Harbor

A few people STILIr defended the
ommentary, "Nixon has withdrawn
xlmost all the troops and tie—es-
.alated the War. What more can
e do without allowing South Vict-
ium to be destroyed by the Com-
nunists'”

Yet not only was meaningful diar
ogue being undertaken but those ads
ocates were being substantially
utnumhered by fedrup, disenr
hanted relatives who were swearing
hat they would never vote ior Nixon
it November.

These people were dissenting with
he rich and enviously respected
elative whose word otherwise was

s' l y 1
his ’h‘tlandish'
. I was quick enough to
top myseli before my long hair
nd college credentials became too
onsplcuous, I recalled those
vowerful words ol Michele Conway
nd others that “alienation is cur
nterrproductive.”
As i embarked from my plane at
I’Hare, for some subliminal, my-
tifying reason, I noticed an ullr
lsual number of servicemen I
ealize there must not have been
.ny more than usual, I think. My
ind is so atuned to war right now
hat I must be partially hallucinar
ing. That is the only explanation
can ioster.
Why else would the murmur oi the
ets sound unmistakably like the
723’s over Hiroshima in old
ar movies?
I iind myself glaring disgustedly at
veryoue walking by unconcerned,
ndisturbed and essentially happy.
1‘ the blockade does not touch 0“
ny retaliatory international inci-
vent, then those people will be none
he worse off, And if some in»
onceivnble tragedy results, it will

liol trike their sedate nerves any
longer to feel it than it will for
niv JCute neurosis to burst I
guess I'm jealous or tranquility,
bill at these times I wish all those
people on my side or the boat
would help prevent the guy on the
other side from drilling a hole in
the liottoni

There is st€|liing else I notice
as I sit here. Over three’fourths
of the hundred or so people seated
around me are reading newspapers
Almost all the papers are turned
to the second and third pages where
they read, "UN issues plea tor
restraint“, “a staggering Nixon
gamble," “from the bottom of our
(the Newspapers) hearts we hope
it works”, and “college protests
across U.S," I pray the last line
doesn’t alienate them again
I try to interpret expressions,
eavesdrop on spurts of conversar
tion and calculate what stories they
are reading. I even try to inter-
pret their reactions the way I want

to see them ,
Every time someone finished the

paper and threw it away, l retrieve
ed it and deposited it on an empty
seat. Within two minutes the paper
was open to page two or three or
even the editorial page. But I
still couldn’t accurately decipher
their reactions.

l watched as they put the paper
down and either sat outwardly uni
stirred or walked off indiiierently.
I was drying to approach them and
coerce them to verballze their con
sciences it not for journalism or
poll sampling sake, then ior mine.

But again the entrenched words oi
the cautious struck, “alienation is
counterproductive”. Who wants to
be verbally accosted in an airport!

This time I’ll never iorgive myseli
ior not alienating, lknow the con

sequences but it seems So futile
to watch all those people walk off
and forget.

And that's history

., Brecht-Play ‘Well Worth lime’

by Sylvia Wallace
The Theatre Department did an
outstanding job in its performances
at Brecht's Threepenny Opera on
May 4, 5, alid 6, The mostimr
pressive feature or the play in its
entirety was the scenery and the
costuming. The sets were not elab-
orate by any means but neverthe-
less they indicated a good deal of
work and skill on the part of Mr.
James Reedcr III and his staff.
The drawings and paintings used to
highlight the various moods of the
different scenes were extremely
good. The technique of tlashing
these very same pictures on twin
screens intermittently with the
ilashing of multircolored lights on
a middle screen was unique. The
scenery ,coincided well with the
costuming due to the dress and
appearance oi the iigures project
an on the screen. The costumes were
also pretty authentic The coherence
oi the scenery and the costuming
aided in the play’s attempt to
actually carry the audience back

I don’t believe. even it Worley’s
interpretation oi the matter were not
a consequence of the iact that he
argued ior one oi two conilicting
‘scholurly’ systems, which I do be

stand that, under attack, a person
may slip, and he must understand
that, being personally involved, he
is hardly the person to judge Nose

college and certainly not the person
to take advantage oi the preponder-
ance oi power located in the de-
partnicnt and in the person oi a

attempt to enlorce his judgment,
If he docs insist upon this, if he
does insist upon using ‘scholarshlp'
as a politely worded grab bag for
whichever oi Nusser’s weaknesses
he can find, or pretend to find,
then it seems to me that Worley’s
own scholarship has tnllen sub-

War Is Fought By Remote Control

by Marty lker

The flight of Automated Air War»
a slide presentation by National
Action/Research on the Military In-
dustl'ial Complex (NARMIC), a
branch of the AI-‘SC--was delayed
ior half an hour Monday night due
to minor difficulties and a discussion
of the catastrophic speech which
president Nixon had just made

Alter 20 minutes of discussion, it
was decided that an all community
meeting would b8 called a ll p.ni
in Herrick Chapel. The show was
then presented, and was more effec-
tive than it would have been had
nothing else happened its Im-
portance was greatly increased. and
most reactions were of horror and
some shock (but its been going on
so lorig--we've known about it ior so
longr-that any shock was minimal).
The program focused upon the met-

hods of the new warfare and the ef-
facts it has had upon the helpless

public who have reaped more of the
calamity than the military of either
side, The planes employed are flown

by remote control from special
booths by experienced pilots,

This means no risk to the flyei‘,
who doesn’t even have to see the
enemy, or in most cases the in—
nocent civilians he is destroyingl
This. no doubt, takes much of the
horror out of killing. The automated
attacks are intended to mdim and
drive people out of areas, not so
much to kill them. If a person is
maimed, it will take about six other
people to care for him. Therefore.
they’ve got seven birds with one
stone This also causes more suf-
fering and demoralization among the
living than a death normally would.

The bombs are strictly anti-
personnel and will not harm a pas—
sing truck, but will tearaparta pas»
sing man or child, Many oi these
bombs are very small. When dropped

to the days oi Mack the Knife.
I must also add that there were
some very notable periormances
in the production, One of these was
by Barry Huii in the role of the
Police Commissioner who was in
cahoots with the beloved criminal,
Mack the Knife. I-Ie exhibited his
flair for comedy in the scene in
which he and Mack review their
old army days in song. The girls
who portrayed the prostitutes did
n very realistic job and their cos-
tumes aided the believability of
their roles. All in all. the pei‘r
formance was quite enjoyable and
well worth the time spent viewing
it,

irom the sky, they rmbed them
selves in the ground or lie on top of
it They are often disguised as ani—
mal droppings, cloth patches, and
other apparently unobtrusive ob—
jects.

There are also plastic bombs which
explode into many pieces, and when
imbeded in the human body Cannot
be detected by X-Ray and there
fore can’t be removed. Sensors to
guide the automated planes to pos-
sible targets are implanted in the
ground in the same fashion as the
mini-bombs and are disguised as a
tropical plant,

One problem: the sensor can’t
distinguish between friend and ioe,
or military and civilllan. Many
senseless bombings have been
carried out because of it. To screw
up these sensory devices, the VC
have hung buckets oi human urine
in the trees and drawn attacks to
unoccupied land.

There is also a laserrguided bun-lb
which, via a laser “eye“ iollows
its subject until contact ls made,
Dropped from a height of four miles,
the bomb is accurate to within six
feet on either side oi its target.

General Abrams was asked whythe
U.S. initiated such a proyect to be-
gin with lie replied that the waning
confidence of the public had to be
regained (lgucss this hasn’t worked),

the prestige oi the army was quickly
dissipating and the morale oi the
troops in Vietnam was very low.
This would correct all that, he felt.
Apparently, it hasn’t.

It is evident that America can’t
win the war, but still refuses to
lose. Abrams has said that we’re
fighting to show them that a war
of liberation is senseless and costly,
that the Viet Cong can never hope
to accomplish their dream of a united
nation,

But, I ask, who are we to stop a
war of liberation, especially when it
doesn't really concern us. when
through such a struggle, the United
States itself became an independent,
self-determined nation? This is
utterly senseless!

What is even more apalling is the
eiiort and expense our government is
going to in order to maim and/or
kill more eiiectively, grotesquely,
and cruelly, all under the pretense
of protecting our interests. What in-
terests are there to protect?

We cannot go on any longer. The
time has come for us to put down
our newspapers and books, to stop
sitting around spectating, and to get
out there and act in a constructive
manner to halt the war effort. Things
have gone much too iar. it we don’t
act now, we may not be able to later.
STAND UP AND BE HEARD!

Random Rock Garden

I'm still not really sure what to
write as I'm sitting here in front
oi the typewriter. The only idea
I can come up with is a sort of
random thoughts column, things that
enter my head as I type this

Something that's missing these
days is some decent “protest, anti»
war etc.” music, Not that it's “e,
cessary of course, but there was
always something exciting about The
Airplane singing, “We are forces

L \ ,, ..
oi chaos in anarchy/Everything
they say we are we are‘” So may
be we're not, or weren’t. But we
should be especially now. As John
Maynll says in “Plan Your Revolur
tlon,” “Don't put off another day/
what you could do today!“ .

I am still amazed at the popularity
of the Beatles. During the KDIC
Beatle show last Thursday the re
quests never stopped coming in And
it's mostly the old stuff people want
to hear. Nostalgia still is a big
emotion in music, and the Beatles

Worley Has Fooled No One

To the Editors:

The philosophy department has
once again flouted the Wishes of the
majority oi Grinnell students and
its own student EPC. And it has
done 50 under circumstances so sin—
ister as to leave no doubt as to its
contempt for both student opinion
and ordinary standards of decency.
For example, the Student EPC had
scarcely begun the grueling task oi
polling philosophy majors when
Worley announced (to both me and
the EPC) that there was no chance
that my contract would be renewed.
Needless to say, the EPC was Ilabr
bergasted. What was the point of
a poll when the department had made
up its mind before the results were
in? And what of Worley’s promise
two months ago to several hundred
students, reported in the SKLB, that
any luture recommendation by the
department regarding my contract
would be based on the majority vote
of the four‘studelit EPC and the three
other faculty members? When it be-
came clear how the majority would
vote, the promise was ignored. The
philosophy department does not even
believe that Student opinion is reler
vant on this issue: Worley recently
stated to me that the department does
not feel obliged to give any reasons
whatever ior terminating my

contract, since I have no ”intrinsic
right” to teach at Grinnell. This
means, i suppose, that students have
no right to know why their instrucs
tors are being removed,

Worley’s most recent justification
ior over-turning the EPC‘S recom-
mendation is Ll scandal. He claims
that although my teaching is quite
commendable, my scholarship has
declined. But the trick is in a play
on the term “scholarship", which
Worley deiines is including my
arguments in the debate over my
contract! He claims that these argur
ments were not “logical". Rememr
bering that my arguments were
partially directed at Worley himself.
it is obvious that he is simply ob-
Jecllng to being criticized. This is
no surprise, for a man generally
disapproves of criticism when he is
the object of that criticism. What
is shameless is Worley’s attempt
to cover this up with talk of “scholr
zirship", a word he deiines in flag-
rant disregard for the rules govern-
ing its use in professional academic
discourse. No one was fooled.

Every attempt by Students to loosen
the political sphincter of the
philosophy department has failed.
The struggle must be either aban-
doned or escalated. Next year will
provide ample time for the latter.

Alan G Nasser

Still bring back the greatest memo-
ries . Report from Salt and
Pepper, Main fourth, that the
Bangla-Desh movie is fantastic

Very quickly thinking back to Janu-
ary, there hasn't been any record
that sticks out in my mind as being
“the" record of 1972. I still like
America and think that they have
the best potential for a new group.
Isaac I-Iayes' single “Shaft" is the
best 45 that I have heard in a long,
long time. Grand Funk Railroad
is still nauseating, while the Moody
Blues "an’SOuld' like the worst Of
the Bee Gees. And I’m sorry, but
Sly Stone and friends haven’t put
out a good song in quite some time

l»knewel»waserightedept: Roberta
Fiack's album ”First Take“ is now
the number ONE album in the na»
tion! . . . Once again Grinnell had
some really dynamic performers.
You missed a lot if you didn't wanr
der onto Central Campus last Th-
ursday aiternoon, ior Luther Allison
was playing and it was a fine time
for all. He must have loved it
here, ‘cause he came back that
night and then again Saturday. That
makes four times altogether thatl
heard him play, and he excites me
a lot more than even BB, King,
which is saying a lot. Allison is
not only a great guitarist, but he
also has a superb voice. Allin
all, a line man who should be heard
more by more people . . .

Grinnell - is the » beginning -dept.
Have you noticed how periormers
who play here oiten rise to fame and
fortune a short time later? Last
year Jackson Browne had a some-
what boring concert here. and now
he‘s high on the Top 40 with a best-
selling album to boot. TheJefferson
Airplane was here before Gracie
Slick was able to afford her Rolls
Royce, John McGloughlin et. a1.
is the big thing on campuses all
over the country now, and also has
a big writevup in "Rollin Stone"
(as did Shawn Phillips, whose new
record “Collaboration” is suppos-
ed to be excellent.) And John Prine
is suddenly becoming a common
name in the music world too, All
this shows that weail must have good
taste, right? And what oi the Balia
Brothers? Can you hear “All Par-
lais Nous ion Bols" on KIOA? (Hope
not') ..... Leonard Bernstein’s
“Mass” will be performed in New
York this summer, complete with
Alvin Ailey Dancers; I highly re-
Commend it .. ,

Well that just about wraps it up.
I guess I'll be back next year, and
will probably have some things to
say about new records ior a change
providing that the summer is not
another musical dryspell. Mean»
while, have a good summer and
KEEP SINGINGII PEACE.
