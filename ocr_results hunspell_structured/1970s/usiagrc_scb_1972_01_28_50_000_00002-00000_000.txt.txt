SAGA Considers A La Corie

by Andrea rrey

Contrary to popular belief, both the
administration and the SGA are con-
cerned about student dissatisfaction
with SAGA Food Service and are
doing something about it. At this
time, Dean of Administration Waldo
S. Walker and Student Coordinator
Bob Meyer are researching possible
alternatives for next year‘s meal
plans. Alternatives in the food ser-
vice have been periodically investir
gated in the past, but student reSr
ponse has never been great enough
to warrant any major changes inthe
present system.

One suggested alternative is the
a la carte cafeteria. According to
this proposal, students would pay
for each item they eat and only each
item. This could be done with either
meal tickets fir—cash. This plan
would curtail the gripe that students
receive no refund for meals they
miss and the gripe that light eaters
pay the same price for board as
those with heartier appetites. There
are, however, considerable draWr
backs to this plan. Students that de-
cide to remain on the present board
system will either have to pay a
higher price for the same food ser-

vice they are now receiving or they
will have to be satisfied with a selr
ection of food that will lack the var—
iety and quality that is presently
maintained. This is because SAGA
is a corporation and must retain a
similar profit margin year after
year,

In order to institute an alternative
such as the above, money would have
to be spent on redesigning either one
of the dining rooms or Gardener
Lounge to accomodate the students
that would be paying for each meal
individually. Cash registers, cashr
lers, and enlarged display facilities
are only a few Of the additional 9X7
penditures that would be encoun-
tered. And these, of course, will be
reﬂected in the price a student will
pay for a meal. A valid assumption
is that students will eat less when
forced to pay cash on the spot for
what they consume. This will yack up
the prices of individual dishes. In
effect, a student will have to pay
more for less food than he is eating
right now. However, one must also
consider the possibility that, under
the proposed system, the tood might
be more attractive, more nourish-
ing, and better-tasting when students
have to part with dollar bills for
dinner.

Dean Walker and Bob Meyer are
presently researching the ways in
which present costs will be affected
by the initiation of viable meal plan
alternatives. After the figures are
compiled, all returning students will
receive this information and be

Walker Runs College

by David Nicolai

The responsibilities assumed by a
college president or dean during
these rough days for American
higher education are probably
enough to overwhelm all but the most
able administrators, But how would
one man cope With the duties nor-
mally performed by the top three
administrators of a college7

Dean Waldo Waker is now in the
process of discovering how He is
presently servmg in his normal
position as Dean of Administration,
and Acting Dean of the College in
the absence of Dean Joseph Wall,
who is a Visiting Professor of His-
tory at Brown University for the se-
mester. Dean Walker has also as,
sumed the duties of President Legr
gett until his return to the campus in
early March from Africa.

He feels quite confident of his abil-
ity to handle this administrative
load, explaining that "I wouldn't have
taken this on if I didn't think l could
do it.“ Dean Walker, who normally
doubles as a Professor of Biology,
is not teaching any courses this 5e.
mester, leaving hiln more time for
his additional responsibilities.

Walker, better known to many olhis
associates as “Wally", is a native
or Fayette, Iowa. A Cum laude grad-
uate of Upper lowa University, he
received his M.S. and PhD, from the
University oi Iowa. Hecame toGrin-

nell as Associate Professor of Bior
logy in 195s, served as Associate
Dean of the College from 1963 to

1965, was appointed Professor of
Biology in 1968 and Dean of Admins
lstratlon in 1969, Various SCientific
journals have published arlicles by
Walker

Walker has two daughters, Martha,
age 12 and Gayle, age 9. He is a
member of the local Mental Health
Board. An avid sportsman, he en»
joys playing tennis and golf, often
hunts with President Leggett, and
has discovered the game of squash
since the opening oi the new PE
Complex. ln whatever time remains
from all these activities, Dean Wale
ker, like most Grinnell students,
enyoys listening to his stereo (folk
music is his favorite) and reading
novels.

Walker agrees with many other
observers that the biggest change
noticeable in Grinnell students (lure
ing the past few years has been a
growing disillusionment with politi—
cal activism. He has observed this
year that students are spending more
time on their own pursuits, particu~
larly academics. Dean Walker dee
rives the greatest satisfaction in his
work here from the opportunity to
work' with students, although because
of his duties as Dean of Administra-
tion he is not ableto meetas many as
he would like

Francesco Trio leaves College

The Francesco Trio, Grinnell's
Resident Chamber ensemble for the
past three years, will leave at the
end of the present academic yearfor
a similar position at Stanford Unis
Versity, The Trio will be the first
resident performing group at Stanr
ford

The Trio leaves with mixed feel»
ings Miss Hampton said that the
freedom at Griunell will be missed,
since everyone tends to be “Pigeunv
holed" in a large institution, They
said they will also miss the close-
ness offered by the Grllinellcommus
nity.

The cultural advantages ofa metros
poiltan area weighed heavily in their
decision to leave. According to Abel,
the expense and diriiculty oihringing
performers to Grinnell and the
limited number of local professional
musicians are the main disadvan-
tages at Grinnell.

The group speaks highly of their
short stay at Grinnell. Miss Hampr
ton praised the college’s under
standing of their profession The
college allowed them time to prac—
tice regularly and leave the campus
for concert appearances throughout
the country. The Trio also thinks
the understanding in the college
administration for the need ofa per-
forming group at Grinnell is unique
and important

Each member of the Trio says they
have enjoyed their opportunities to
explore fields of particular interest
to them. Mr. Schwartz enyoyed his
classes even though they were larr
ger than any he has previously
taught He commented that the con-
tact with students is much closer at
Grinnell both in and out of class,
and that the quality of the students
is high,

Mr, Kulawiec, Director ofthe Tear
cher Education Program appeared

a questionnaire to all students to
measure their response to such a
program
Several interested students pre»
pared a response form which ap-
peared in the Tuesday edition of the
Campus Memo. Dr Clotfelter indie
cated that the information derived
from this simple survey will pros

quired, and that supplementary in—

opportunity to explore nonclassical
and nonswestern fields of music in
addition to learning to play the rebec.
He also participated in establishing
Grinnell’s electronic music studio.

The Trio feels the have success-
fully maintained and developed the
position of resident performing
group, since the program will be
continued. Miss Hampton said “I
can't imagine any school treating us
better.” and all three expressed

ance before the Council to discuss
