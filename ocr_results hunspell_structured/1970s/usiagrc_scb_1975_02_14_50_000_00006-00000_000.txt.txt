“It was a great party!” The
annual senior “100 Days Party"
held last Monday was declared a
success by most oi its participants.

“Spaces” played for over zoo
seniors, guests and faculty
members. Many studenn praised
the group’s performance, noting
that A. Richard Tuener. new
president of Grinnell College, jived
to the music, While several
studenm formed a large circle
around him, President Turner
demonstrated his dance
techniques. “I had a ball,” said
Turner enthusiastically, “I thought
the party was marvelous."

Rumor had it that amidst the
flurries of party preparations the
organizational committee faced
financial problems due to the
ripping off or lickeu. Connie
Meacham, however. chairwoman
of the committee, denied that any
tickets were stolen.

urner Jive on

Ms. Meacham acknowledged
that financing was a problem.
Even though tickets sold for two
dollars per person, this proved
insufficient as a deficitoi over 5100
resulted, She cited miscalculation
of the number or people planning to
attend as a reason for the deficit
which the college paid for.

Through the turnout of seniors
was rather small, those who did
attend said they had a really good
time, One senior woman suggested
that mere should be some kind 01
dance every week, “Give us
music I " she demanded. Along with
dancing, munchies, and mixed
drinks, limitless free beer was
served.

With the compliments, however.
came several Criticisms The
major gripes included the cost of
tickets and the high cost of the
mixed drinks. Others cited their
various reasons for not attending

“I don’t like beer,“ commented
one senior, while another added.
“It would have been more prac»
tical to go to the Horn and start
from scratch.” Still another senior
grunted, “l'm just not a party
person.”

“If they must serve beer."
proposed one senior woman, “Let
them have two taps so you don't
have to wait such an unreasonably
long time in line when you could be
doing other thingsilike dancing."
She added, “ ‘Spaces’ was very
good."

Plans ior next year might in-
clude a rise in the price of the Q-
tickels. Ms. Meacham especially
appreciated the American
Legion’s use of their facilities.

Wanda Wakefield, a member of
the organizational committee,
based the poor attendance on the
fact that the night for the party tell
on Monday. Though she tell more
people would have turned up on a
weekend night, both she and
several of the seniors stressedl
“The ‘100 Days Party' just
wouldn‘t be the same it it wasn’t on Or
the moth day.”

MS. Wakefield enthusiastically
concluded that she had a great
time at the party. She pointed out,
“People on this campus get so
obsessed with their paperrwriting
that they sometimes lorget how to
have fun," ”Give us music!”
