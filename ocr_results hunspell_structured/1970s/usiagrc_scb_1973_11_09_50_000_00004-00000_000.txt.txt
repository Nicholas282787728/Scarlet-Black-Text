The Same New Problems

Thoughtlessness. Lethargy. Apathy.

They are major factors in two of the serious prob—
lems facing the Grinnell community today...vanda1ism,
and the fuel crisis. ‘

Grinnell has faced an unparalleled wave of vandal-
ism in recent weeks. Windows, costing $400 and more
each, have been smashed; doors have been ripped from
their hinges and door frames from buildings, and
last weekend, an entire restroom was destroyed.

Physical Plant Director Dale Hawn says vandalism
is so common on this campus that, below a certain
level, it is viewed routinely.

What disturbs us, however, is that students take
little notice of the problem and do nothing to stop it.
SGA has made a start on the problem with its plan
to appoint a committee to look for a “specialpro-
secutor” for the campus vandalism.

However, no prosecutor and no system can do as
much for solving the problem as an aroused student
body. If the attitude towards destruction of property,
college. or private, changes from tolerance to out-
rage, there will be no vandalism problem.

college or private, changes from tolerance to outrage,

there will be no vandalism problem.

In the same sense, the energy crisis is as much as

anything the fault of lazy individuals.

President Glenn Leggett has asked the campus com-
munity to turn off unneeded lights in classrooms,

offices, and rooms.

It should not be necessary for the President to make
such a request -- turning off unneeded lights should

be a simple matter of common sense.

However, many members of the Grinnell community
are not noted for their common sense, so a memo is
needed to remind them to turn off lights, and a special
prosecutor is needed to keep them from breaking

windows.

‘ We need a new group of concerned Grinnellians ~-
concenied not about etherial causes (noble though they
may be) on which they can have little effect, but on

important problems that affect us directly.

How difficult is it to take a bicycle when shopping
instead of starting up the car? There are very few
Places in Grinnell that are distant enough to justify
the use of a car -- and very few purchases that will
[not fit nicely into a backpack carried on foot or by
bicycle. The fuel savings would be significant, as would
the improvement in the individual’s physical condi~

tion.

This is just one example of how individual action
can make a difference. Every time you consume part
of our scarce energy supply, ask yourself, “Is there
a way people-power an handle this?" If we all do
this, we can survive and pros

crisis.

And the next time you see attempts at vandalism

do something to stop it. Vandalism thrives on
apathy. Fuel is consumed by lethargy. Trite as it
may sound, defeat of these two attitudes can goa

long way towards solving the

larger problems .

Day. lhanks For Help

To the Editors!

AS co- ordinator of the
James' Cong Bang there area
few things lwould like to say.

First, i should clarify whal
happened wilh the band before
I am sued for false adver-

tisement. At 8:00 Saturday
night I was informed that the
original band, “Joint Sessi'
ons," had cancelled. Panic.
Thanks lo the aliens ofev'ery-
one involved, by 8:20 we had
arranged for a stereo system
to fill (his void. At this lime‘
MS. Dentel informed methere
was a band on me way from
Des Moines. However, when
they shuwedat 12:20, they were
not allowed to set up. Many

thanks are owed (0 Bill Burke
and Jeff Fallon for the use of
their stereo equipment and
music as Well as for the time
they put in running it.

Next, l'd like to sincerely
thank Dave McConnell, affec-
tionately known no dogs Dave,
for his exceptional amount of
help and coroperadon. [truly
do not know what I would have
done without him. (Especially
during the clean up when he
pitched right in along with us)
Thanks also to his wife who
wasn't even paid for her eff-
orts. ‘

As for the clean up crew: I
would like to publicly thank

all of those who stayed wiﬂi

lessen: Bravo For laiin American Week

To the Editors:

This week is Latin American
Culture Week. It is the Cuimln‘
alion of a longrbegun effort and
desire to promote a better u“,
derslanding of Lalin American
peoples; who are they, where
they come from and where they
are going. The week is sponso-
red by th Latin American Ho-

' ‘ s first year of exiss
(ences 'whose people havea decp'
felt concern for the present
state of ignorance or inditlerr
ence that we exhibit lowards our
American brothers.

Illustrating this disregard and
disrespect are,the outrageous
policies of (ye again) the Nix-
on Administration-‘35 well as
ALL previous governmenls. Our
condescending attitudes, repeats
ed interference In internalpoli-
tics (Qiba, Dominican Republic,
Chile), and continuous military
support of repressive regimes
that protect our economic ins
[eresls (Brazil) are obvious ll'l’
justices that we must no longer
tolerate. Yet, as always,a rising
public consciousness increases
the potential for positive change.
And in [his sense Iarn OptlmlS'
[i whereas our foreign poll"
cies towards Latin America are
Weakly based and still in the
formative stage. Thus a height
ened understanding and sensir
tivity for this culturE' distinct

from our own--must be (he first
step in restoring our lost creche
bility and lrust.

So we start with Grinnell. Here
is a school With an excellent
Spanish department that plays
down Latin America. There is
no option for majors to focus
on Latin America rather than
Spain. There is no interdiscipr
linary Latin American Studies
majorl Neither has active ens
couragemenl of an independent
major been forthcoming when
needed. It is our hope that in St-
imulating interests in Latin Am-
erica, we mayalsogathera sense
of lhis interest and perhaps ini-
tiale a re-evaluation of the place
of L.A. sludlesin Grinnell.

This Week is now a time for
learning and thought. I: you are
interested (you've read thisfar),
come lo some of the planned ev-
Brits. Think about hoW Latin Amt
erica concerns you, Think too
about the future of Latin Ameri*
can studies at Grinnell. '

Finally, you are all invilcd to
an Open House at the Latin Ann
eriL‘an House, 1227 Park. Sat. af-
lernoon. There will bE a number
of Latin American students from
other colleges in Iowa whom we
have invited for the Weekend, Soif
you see a foreign studentwanderr
