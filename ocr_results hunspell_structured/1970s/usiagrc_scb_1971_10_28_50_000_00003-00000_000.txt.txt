fodder Arch l
Ollnumph

by Jack Doppelt

Grinnell may soon be the site oi a
golden arch, it greatly depends upon
the response oi the students oi this
institution oi higher “earning.”
The Grinnell Chamber oi Com—
merce is planning to recommend that
McDonald's open a iranchise here.
However, they must besatisiactorily
assured that the students will
support that “kind oi place."

A small questionnaire will be put
in your mailbox. it will ask such
harmless, eiiortless questions as,
“would you like to seeaMCDonald's
near the college," “would you eat
there," and “ would you be more
likely to go to a McDonald's than
another hamburger stand?”

Remember that by slandering the
name of McDonald's, you would be
attacking an institution more com
iorting than mother, more edible
than apple pie, and a lot better to
eat out than the girl next door. And
less expensive too,

water. I ieel like enlisting in the

lEAP Needs Helpers

it you've always wondered how you
could get involved in the national
ecological movement, the answer is
simple: become a LEAP volunteer.

During the next week, LEAP will
lie recruiting anilinhcroivolunteers
to help in a variety oi ecological
action campaigns The work is fun
and simple, and requires very little
time, The standard LEAF workproe
iect requires irom one to two hours
a week, and reireshments are pro-
vided for the more strenuous pro»
JeCts (which aren’t really very
strenuous).

Being a LEAP volunteer involves
only one responsibility, and that isto
show up where you'i-esupposedtobe
when you're supposed to be there,
The actual work is easy and takes
about as much time asastudybreak,
which most oi us take onceanigntnt
least. The atmosphere is iree and
good-natured cursing and maligning
oi ecological enemies) It is a time
when you can come and unwind and
yet still do your thing ior Nature

LEAP has only one criterion ior
volunteers--reliability, Pro]ectsdo
depend on people who can make iton

Cleveland Cottage has devised its
own ingenius solution to the trau-
matic, number one campus issue
these days: The Pet Problem.
Beiore any pet is brought into
Cleveland, each resident must re-

type of pet the student involved
plans on keeping. Then all 4 Stu-

ior creating certain environmental

a right oi action...ior protection oi

The significance at these bills lies
in the power they would vest in
individual citizens to initiate civil

suits against polluters. This would
throw the iield open to litigation by
the many environmentally-con-
cerned groups around today, which
now are relatively powerless

as SAGA‘s Food Service Director,
had this information [or the S&B
about various procedural changes
made at Grinnell this year by the
22-yearrold Company,

The recent hike inpricclorahsen»
tees at the forum PDR'S (private
dining rooms) was made to reduce
waste and to lower SAGA’s costs
due to that waste. Since most stur
dents who miss a private dinnerend
up eating in one or thedining rooms,
SAGA is iorced to prepare two din»
ners ioroneperson. Thenewsystem
imposes an extra charge tor the
second meal, in theory, at least, the
long run Cost tothe student should be
reduced by the measure.

A number or other changes are in
the works [or SAGA A continental
breakiast is in the planning stages,
Ramaker has in mind a new Ineat

an attempt to Cut SAGA's costs; the
