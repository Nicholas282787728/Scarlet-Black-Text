Letelier decries
Chilean injustices

by Bob Mitchell

These are bad times in
faithful replica of paradise."

This phrase, taken from the
Chilean national anthem, was used
by lsabel Letelier Monday night
when she spoke on “Human Rights
in Chile." Her lecture, and the
information that has appeared in
the American media, paint an ugly
picture of political repression in
the “replica of paradise."

According to Letelier, the
military junta of General Augusto
Pinochet has killed 30,000 people
since it rose to power in a coup
against Marxist President
Salvador Allende in 1973. In ad-
dition, 100,000 people have passed
through torture chambers, and
500,000 to 800,000 Chileans have
gone into exile, according to
Letelier.

in fact, most of the world
recognizes that the Pinochet
regime is unusually cruel and
brutal. Last March, for example,
the United Nations Human Rights
Commission voted 26 to 1 to tone
demn the Pinochet regime’s
violations of human rights.

Within Chile itself, the Catholic
Vicariate of Solidarity issued a
report in February, 1976, which,
found that DINA, the security and
intelligence organization of the
government, consistently ignored
laws that required notification of a

Browning named Vice

Kenneth C Browning, Assocxate
Dean for Student Affairs at the

Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has accepted an offer
from Grinnell to become Vice-
Provost.

Browning. 33, accepted the
posnion last Thursday night. He
was on campus in late January for
a round of intervtews with meme
bers of the SGA. administration,
and faculty,

No definite date has been set for
Browning to assume the Vice-
Provost position, but he predicts he
will take over around May 1.

Browning has spent much of his
career as an administrator at
M.I.T. He has been Associate Dean
of Students there since 1975, From
1971 to 1975, he was Assistant Dean.

As Associate Dean, Browning

ofhis or her arrest. In addition, the ‘

vicariate found that the principle
of habeas'corpus was “strangling
in red tape,” according to the
Washington Post.

THE report also concluded that
DINA was responsible for “an
important part” of all civil rights
abuses, which. as the Post coma
mented, included “ignoring arrest
procedures, conducting illegal
searches, and holding prisoners
incommunicado , . . ” Perhaps the
most ominous finding of the report,
however, was its conclusion that
the “state of siege" declared by
Pinochet and the military to
“extirpate the Marxist cancer"
has taken on a “permanent
character."

The Pinochet government of
ficially abolished DINA in
November, 1977. and replaced it
with another intelligence
organization, Letelier, however,
rejects the idea that any
meaningful reorganization has

taken place,

"It is the most childish story.
Pinochet has no respect for world
wide public opinion, so he thinks he
can tell them any fairy tale and
everybody‘s going to believe it,”
she said.

In a recent attempt to lessen the
hostility of world opinion, the
Pinochet government held a
referendum on the conduct of the
Chilean government. Under the
balloting arrangement established
by the regime. a vote against
Pinochet and his government was
indicated by placing a sticker of a
black hag, the symbol of anarr
chism, on the ballot.

According to Pinochet, 75 per
cent of the people gave their ap-
proval to his government. Letelier,
however, dismisses these results
as meaningless.

”NO dictator would call an
election without knowing exactly
what he wanted,” she said.

The campaign against all forms

regime took on a deeply personal
dimension for Leteller on Sep-
tember 19, 1976, when a bomb

Students challenge FOG

by Debbie Weillcr

Tuesday night in the Forum Grill
over 200 students gathered to
witness a confrontation between
students with grievances about the
Food Service and the Food Service
sub-committee, led by Dave Mc-
Connell,

The meeting was originally
intended by its organizers, Jim
Stuart and Carrie James, to be a
mass graffiti attack on “Fort
McConnell” to underscore
student protest against the con-
struction of the structures as well
as the lack of student participation
in the Food Service. However, the
Food Service subcommittee (a
subcommittee of the Committee
on Student Life) had scheduled a
committee meeting in South
Lounge for that night after hearing
about the proposed gathering
earlier in the day. The presence of
the subcommittee members,
including McConnell, effectively
turned the gathering into an open
forum.

STUART and James started the
proceedings by delineating their
grievances against the ad»
ministration in general and the
Food Service in particular. The
construction of the Grill “turrets."
which occured in the students‘
absence, was only one instance of
the administration's refusal to
solicit student opinion, they
claimed. They also cited the
restrictive board plan, the closing
of the Grill between 4 p.m. and 7
pm, and the inﬂexibility of the
Food Service “bureaucracy.”

Provost

commented that she was
pressed" with Browning She did
state however, that she was
disappointed that the ad
ministration did not hire a cane
didate with experience in air
firmative action. Nonetheless, she
commented that Browning
exhibited El willingness to make
himself aware of affirmative
action laws so that he could sucn
cesslully execute his responr
Slh'lles as affirmative action
oflicer.

Browning has an 5.3 in
Aeronautics and Astrona utics from
M.I,’l‘,. and an S M. in
management from the Alfred P
Sloan School of Management, at
M.l.T.

James called for “food for people,
not for profit,” She demanded to
see the Food Service budget, in»
cluding Dave McConnell’s salary.

James and Stuart declared that
they had the support of the student
body. They felt that the graffiti on
the structures’ walls, sponr
taneously put up by the students,
indicated the students‘ general
dissatisfaction. They requested
that the structures, it destined to
remain, be officially declared
“graffiti walls.” They also
protested against the possibility of
“reprisals” against graffiti writers
by the administration.

BOTH McConnell and Dean of
Student Affairs .llm Tederman
were on hand to answer the
charges. Tederman denicd that
any sort of punishment of the
graffiti writers was forthcoming,
adding that the situation had yet to
be resolved. He claimed that the
Office of Community Rights,
which will review the matter, is a
nonrjudicial body which does not

plan, which he displayed at the
meeting, made the structures
appear much more pleasing than
they actually turned out.

However, he stressed that he
welcomes suggestions from
students as to how to improve the
structures' appearance.

Jim Stuart agreed that "it's
definitely stirred student interest .

, I hope and expect that students
will be taking a more open mic
now." He feels that the graffiti was
a good idea. “Most of the campus
has supported and enjoyed the
graffiti . . and shares the
dissatisfaction that caused the
graffiti " He added, however. that
in spite of Tederman’s statements
to the contrary, he still [eels that
the possibility ior reprisals exists.
“I was disappointed that the issue
of reprisals was not dealt with." he
said.

McConnell denied that students

structures in the Grill was made by

he noted. Every committee
meeting is open to the public.
although few non-committee
members ever attend McConnell
has held open forums to solicit
student opinion in the past, but
they have been poorly attended. He
also added that he is readily ac-
cessible lo sludcnls who Wish to
offer suggestions or complaints,
Not one student. he said, came lo
his office to complain about the
new structures.

MCCONNELL also explained the
purpose of the structures. A new
freezer and compressor were in-
stalled in the Grill area; the left
“turret" was built to cover them
up, The right side was added to
provide balance. He admitted that

committee will meet on Tuesday to
discuss possible revisions, and, as
usual. the meeting is open to the
public.

McConnell also answered
James‘s charge that he is trying to
run the Food Service to make a
profit. He emphasized that he tries
to run the service as economically
as possible to prevent board costs
from rising. and that nutrition is it
high priority. Ile statcd that hc uns

that the student organizers of the
