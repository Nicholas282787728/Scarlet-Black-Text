Simpson College. Dombrowski im-
agines that Simpson will be better
than Grinnell; however, his attitude is
hardly defeatist. “It will be a learning
situation,” he says, “It we fail, it
doesn’t mean we are failures. we are

‘out there to improve ourselves in»
dividually."

This year, wrestling has drawn a
total of 15 people out on the mats. Oi
this “unusually enthusiastic bunch of
guys," eight are freshmen, two are
returning lettermen, and [ivg have no
previousexperience. “Nevertheless,"
says four-year wrestler Marquis
Lyles, ”we will probably have the best

team since I have been here; we will
improve drastically.” Lyles attributes
his faith in the team’s success to the
coaching and conditioning of Dom-
broski. As opposed to previous years.
the team is running two miles a day
along With its work on a rigorous
weightlifting program. “He has
restored a winning spirit." says Lyles,

As a coach, Dombroski faces what
he considers “an ideal team" insolar
as every wrestler will be able to wres-
tle at his own natural weight. Because
wrestling is divided into weight
classes, it is not unusual for a wrestler
to have to lose as much as 29 pounds
in order to conipete in a particular

class. ”This is an incredible advan»
tage," says Dombroski, who feels
that, if not done properly, losing
weight can be potentially harmful to
one's health.

During the three years Dombroski
coached at Ripon, he was credited
with rebuilding the entire program.
Ex-coach Mark Bowman feels that
nipon was as good a team then as
Grinnell's is now. Bowman has
already watched a few practices and
he is positive that Dumbroski will do
for Grinnell what he did for Ripon.
“He really knows his stuff, the team
will be better this year," added
Bowman.

Dip with Fred and Ginger or rock with Mick

You can rock it in the aisle this
‘Weekend with Gimme Shelter or you
can roll it in the aisle with The Party.
Wild, unpretentious fun and games for
all the little darlings at Grinnell. The
Party, a slapstick comedy, moves
swiftly from one event to another with
no basic underlying theme, sort of like
a tutorial, except a lot more enterwin-
ing. Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards
(of‘Pink Panther tame) collaborated
on this concoction of sight gags,
bumbling humor, and physical humor

to create a spectacle [or the id. There
aren't any social revelations in this
film, no deep underlying meanings,
and no bland social commentaries.
Just remember that you Should never
go to a Sellers movie straight.

I could tell you about the plot, but
what's the use? It has nothing to do
