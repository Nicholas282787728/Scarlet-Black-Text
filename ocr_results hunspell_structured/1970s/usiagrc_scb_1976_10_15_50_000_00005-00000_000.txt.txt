Is there a creeping menace on
fampus, or is the White Paper an
albino herring? We sent our
reporter Rover, armed with the

Student Government Association
survey, to accost a typical Grinnell

ttudent to find out What the student
"on the Street thinks of the White

Paper, the SGA survey, or it he
does in tact think. Our reporter
talked to Craig Crisco, a pre-med
biology major from around
Chicago.

Reporter Rover: Mr. Crisco . . .

Craig (kisco: Call me Craigiall
the pretty girls do.

RR: Well, Craig. do you have an
opinion on the White Paper, in
general?

C.C.: I don't feel it is better
than the paper towel that weighs

;ﬁfty per cent more.

,R.R.: No, Craig, we mean the
document published by the College
under the direction of President
Turner.

. C.C.: So he won the electioneI
qibught Carter had it sewed up.

some questions irom the SGA
survey, and we want your gut
reaction—ieel free to express
yourseli as honestly as you know
how.

CC Uh...sure, _,

R.R.: Who do you, Craig Crisco,
think should attend Grinnell?

C.C Who the hell Cares.

always have been a charmer.

R,R.: What about the question of
shared experience?

C.C.: You mean the ”Grinnell

experiences, and the shared ones
have been meaningful.

R.R.: Does your schooling have
any relation to practical affairs?
C.C.. I've never had a “prac-
tica aifaireimpetuous girlsebut
as for my schooling, I'm sure when
i am a doctor the experience I’ve
gained here will help me imr
measurably.

R.R.: Does the college relate to
the problems of a global society?
C, : Grinnell is obviously a
microcosm oi global society since
we, too, have our representative
minorities.

R.R.: Do you find Grinnell 3
Distinctive Place?

C.C.: Compared to what?

R,R.: Can a joyful community he
achieved at Grinnell?

C.C.: Isn’t there a song like that:
“Joyful joytul we adore thee. . It”
R.R,: Wcll, Craig, your answers
haven't been entirely appropriate,
but do you have any additional
comments for our rapt audience?
C.C.: I want everyone to know
that I take all college matters with
the utmost sincerity and
seriousness. and that I will make
quite a dashing doctor. I suggest
that we have a distinctive. joyful
practical, personal and well at-
tended bonfire with the White
Paper as fuel.

R.R.: Thank you Craig Crisco,

bimbo, finals, and EU

by PatEdmunds

After much exploration, ex-
perimentation, observation and
contemplation I think l can now
safely announce that mid-terms
and finalsiin the Iorm of long
papers—are essential catalysts for
a successful liberal education.

I have found during periods of
Severe academic tension that
ordinary methods of
procrastination are taboo, The
prosaic is everywhere at this time
undesirable, The tenrthirty talker
and I have just both agreed this
day that we shall only fritter and
chatter once this week in the
regular place.

For any good design to avoid
academics now must be deliberate.
well-plotted, and, in the best of
circumstances, it must be covert.
None is more gauche than the one
Who idles over Arthur Hailey’s
latest book or that Zen and the Art
of Motor Cycle Riding in the
Forum. Such an activity in a public
place, during a period oi comr

munal stress, is disgraceful.

“I must go to the llbraryl" I
announce at the end of an extended
dinner hour, and my dining
companions are powerless to
detain me. I am, all in a flash, over
to Big Burl. For awakened in me is
an uncontrollable desire to
research the unknown.

After [pass into the cold, harsh
light oi" Burling I find a table,
remote, away from the clock, the
carrels and the noisy iront door. I
find just the right chair, arrange
my books asifto study, remove my
coat and shoes and disappear.

Into the stacks I go secretly to
thumb through the 600’s or the
five's and iour's or three’s,
stopping to peer through any book
whose title arrests me. I go
through the journals, and down
into the bound volumes, and up the
back stairs to feast on social
policy.

After an hour or two of this
frenzied search for truth I rest a

ling

while with the great dictionary and
read it as one might read a
telephone book while waiting for a
bus, or the Times classifieds on a
dull Friday night. And then with a
toorbrief pass through the
reference section, where the best
books are kept, and perhaps a
shufflethrough the encyclopedia to
determine where the roots of
pineapples grow, or a long, ad-
miring study of the topographic
maps oi Iowa I am oif in search of
my coat and shoes and a good
night’s sleep.

This liberal education routine
may continue ior several days
while every nervous, empty pocket
oi my brain cries out for
satisfaction. The time will come, I
know, when every letter owed is
written, every dirty sock is clean,
every cigarette is smoked and
every friend is in coversion. And
this is the time when the agony will
be at an end, and this is the time
when I will write.

 

Point of view

Ooicheo
and style

by Bob Aldrich

On a warm day last spring, Iwas
sitting in iront oi the Forum eating
an ice cream cone, when I was
accosted by a faculty member
about my appearance—my shirt.
to be exact. It was an old blue work
shirt that I had resurrected from
the dead and stolen from one of my
brothers. Ihad patched it until it no
longer had any semblance of
respectability, but it was a good
shirt, and I was too cheap to buy a
new one.

“Are those real patches?” he
asked. I was ﬂabbergasted, and
told him so.

“Why would they be anything

All campus referendum

by Bob Handler

Next Friday there will be an all-
campus referendum to approve an
amendment to the SGA con-
Stitution. Brieﬂy, this amendment
gls for the yearly election oi two

icampus coordinators. These
coordinators would have virtually
ﬁe identical financial respon»
llities that hall coordinators now

have.

There are a number of reasons
for this amendment to be passed.
The controversy last semester
over the use oi oflcampus. non-
collegeowned funds (equivalent to
hall iunds) indicated the need for
greater accountability regarding
the use of these iunds. Before the
funds were temporarily placed
under the jurisdiction of the
off-campus representatives were
questioned as to how they used

these funds, they noted that these
duties were nothing short of a
nuisance and interfered with their
‘ither assigned legislative duties.

This amendment will relieve the
uticampus representatives oi this
Student Coordinator's Office, they
were under the direction of the off-
campus, non-college-ownedr
housing representatives. When the
burden and will promote greater
fiscal accountability to all off-
campus, nonscollegerownedr
housing residents. There would, of
course, be some added respon-
sibilities for the oil-Campus
coordinators over what the hall
coordinators are now required to
do. However, these duties are
added merely to insure that all off-
campus residents are aware of how
their money is being spent. For

example, the oficampus coorr
dinators would be required to post
a notice of expenditures as soon as
an expenditure has been made.
This notice would include: (i) the
amount spent, t2) the date of the
expenditure, (3) who spent the
money, and (4) what the money
was spent tor/The notice would be
posted in some conspicuous place
in the Post Ofﬁce and the coorr
dinators would also submit a
similar announcement to the
Campus Memo.

When uiis amendment is passed,
it will also relieve the Student
Coordinator’s Office from having
to handle these funds. Instead, off—
campus residents will have a
chance to elect their own coorr
dinators soon after [all break.

else," I replied. I didn’t tell him,
but it seemed like an idiotic
question to me. He told me that
patches “were the style,” and I
looked in style, so he was just
curious.

The incident, though trivial in
itself. intrigued me; it is an ins
teresting commentary on our way
oilife. The irony is obvious: we are
now So far from being utilitarian in
our lifestyle that we parody it. We
want to look authentic and hard
working. but since we are not, we
put patches over perfectly good
clothing.

Back before this, however, was a
time when it was not simply
fashionable to repair your jeans,
but something that you did because
it made sense to take care of what
you owned, What we have lost sight
oi in all of this is the Concept of
function, of taking care of what we
have. or. as Robert Pirsig would
have it. the ”art of motorcycle
maintenance.”

Why has this change in attitudes
taken place? Simply, it is the result

 

of wealth, of unlimited access to
goods. There are two ways to own
something: you can own it because
it is useful—a means to an end; or,
you can own it because it is
something to have—an end in it-
self. It is the second attitude that
causes problems, and while the
word “materialism“ is overused,
thatis exactly what it is. There are
any number of problems that arise
from materialism, but the one that
concerns us here is mantenance;
care. It is hard to care about
something when its worth can
never be realized, When we use a
bicycle to get out and travel or
exercise, or appreciate the
scenery, the bike is worth
something to us because it per-
iorms a iunction. But when we get
out on a bike just because bicycling
is in vogue, or because our bike is a
$400 custom equipped super»
special, all we realize is the ego-
satisfaction, the selfrgratificatiun.
There is no function here, and the
object is valued only as long as it is
in style or is a statussymbol. It has
no legitimate lasting function, and
thus ialls into misuse and neglect.

The alternative? Restore func—
tion to its proper place. If we could
only begin buying what we would
use instead of what we could have!
As soon as we begin using what we
have, it has some value to us, and
so we take care of it so we can use
it again.

When function becomes more
important than style or status, we
will begin caring for what we have,
and it will increase in value, a
value beyond dollars, I think this is
called “character,” that unique
property that something has when
it has aged and been through more
than two or three short seasons.
Perhaps this is why antiques and
old houses are so appealing; may
have some acquired worth and
value.

There is yet another value that
comes out of “maintaining one‘s
motorcycle,” and that is the self-
worth and learning that comes
irom such an enterprise. There is
no time to go into that here. But if
we could change our attitudes in
this way, it would make more
sense, and spare us the idiocy oi
patching perfectly good clothes.
