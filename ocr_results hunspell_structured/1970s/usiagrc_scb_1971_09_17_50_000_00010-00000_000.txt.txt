Plan Ahead!

Now is the time to begin planning symposia
and colloquia for later in the year.

In recent years the calendar of events has
been very heavily burdened during the month
of April, simply because so many people wait
until second semester to start organizing spe-
cial programs of general interest. In fact,
there are so many events in April, that very
few students can afford the time to attend a
significant portion of what are usually very
interesting and informative speeches, lectures,
and film programs.

During the cold winter months of February
and March, the campus could stand a few pro-
grams besides the usually excellentRosenfield
lectures. There is still time to plan some good
public events for this semester.

Qie good way to increase attendance at the
event you sponsor or organize would be to
schedule it at a time when few other general
interest programs are likely tobeinprogress.

LOOK BOOKER LOOK!

Have you ever met the man in the street
who thought he was most unique?

Or maybe, the man in school
who regarded people in the street
as fools?

It seems quite funny to me.
To think man thinks that others
are less than he.

But in our society
It‘s a problem of variety

Some say it's the competition
that makes the condition

But I say to the hip

And to those that think they are slick
You better learn quick.

The message from my lip.

It is not the rich man that digs the ditch,
And it is not the poor man that joins the cliques.

It's not the rich drawing compensation.
And it's not the poor on vacation.

Take time and learn this line
Look, Booker, look!

The teacher is a crook.
Look, Booker, look!

Look, Booker, look!
Don't let yourself get hooked.
Look, Booker, lookl

Look, Booker, look]
Don't believe everything in books.
Look, Booker, Lookl

The "ln"s' And Ouis‘Of Discrimination

by Jack Doppelt
If you scan last week's 5&5
you'll discover six stories
regarding some form of dis-
crimination at Grinnell. W0-
men and blacks captured the
discrimination honors, but 0-
mer sundry minorities were
included. Women, of course,
are only a minority semanti-

mliy, not numerically.
Pessimists may interpret

this extensive coverage as an '

illustration of how deeply our
prejudices are rooted. Opti-
mists visualize timesaechane
gin’ and progress accomin'.
Advocates of equal opportune
ity play with statistics topro-
ve that their minority is be-
coming extinct. I don't claim
enough foresight tocategorize
myself at all.

But what disburbs me are
arguments such as: "If one of
our minority meets the mini-
mum qualifications fora posir
tion, or foradmission,we sho-
uld demand that our candidate
be chosen."

Equal opportunity, bullshit!
That's outright reverse dis*
crimination. I don't care if
the purpose is to equal things
out from the depths we are
presently in. Quotas. written
or practiced, limiting or in
stating, are discriminatory.

Suppose a group were to in-
sist that the professors are
all too old to adequately res
late to the students. Statistics
can back them up. The me»
dian age of students at Grin-
nell is 19. The median for
professors? Let's give thema
Jack Benny 39.

By differentiating faculty
hierarchy, you would further
discover that none of the ages
of instructors, assistant pro-
fessors, associate profs?
sors or full professors cor—
respond with those of their
students. In many areas, stu-
dents could better relate with
faculty who have endured our
modern educational institw
tions. That is partially the
theory behind our residential
adviser structure.

If you agree that "women
students should have faculty
advisers who can counsel them
concerning the problems wo-
men face in graduate schools
and in professions," you shun
uld see the need for faculty
advisers who are even the
slightest bit aware of modern
graduate school problems.

Now these students rise and
demand that ZSryear‘olds be
considered for future openings
and hired if they are quali-
fied. Who cares if a 35 year
old or 55 year old is more
qualified; we must offset the
present discriminatory imbar
lance.

Then there are the com-
plaints from another minority
group. These are the students
who wear braces. Facts first,
there are no professors with
braces on their teeth. Thirtye
five students have braces and
they have banded together in
this fight to straighten things
out.

Years ago dental records
accompanied transcripts. Th-
ese have since been proven
discriminatory. But pictures

"Sepalionulism"

To the Editors:

I hope that last weeks spur-
ious coverage of the Joint
Board "budget review” (in
specific the row over alloca-
tions for the radio station) is
not indicative of your future
policy. In this caseyou served
to grossly sensationalize the
issue and convey your perdi-
tious misunderstanding of the
Boards' purpose far andwide.
If this is to be your function,
please inform your readers,
so that accuracy and your
phlegmatit: ballyhoo are not
construed as synonymous.

The only intent of the Joint
Board was to gather the ine
formation necessary for a
responsible review of the ra
dio station budget. Amoment
of reflection (tearfully, now
t'would be tardy) will tell you
that budgetary review is per»
haps the most importantfunc-
tion with which the Board is
charged. In most cases, e.g.
Social Coordinating Come
mittee, Auditors Office, Inla-
tive Fund, hall fund and SGA
allocation, we communicated
directly with the people in-
volved about their financial
requirements and pursuant
rationales. In other cases,
the Finance Committee pro-
vided requisite information.
Only in the case of the radio
station was no information or
direct justification offered by
the Finance Committee. The—
rchre, your editorial was
quite correct in highlighting
our lack of knowledge about
the radio station.

As a result, Mr. Brill felt
it necessary to seek the jus-
tification for five salaried
($300 each) positions in the
station management. By no
means did he atmck this site

uation as improper. In real-
ity, then, it was our intent
to pose the same questions
for the radio station as for
every other recipient of SGA
money. No assault was laun-
ched on the radio station: at
least to no greater degree
than in the case of, for exam—
ple, the Initiative Fund.

It is unfortunate and to the
discredit of the Board that
this informational deficiency
came to light so belatedly.
But to neglect our function
further and blindly apprtr
priate the funds would have
been a doubly grievous wrong.

Even more reprehensible
than this original neglect was
the heinous misconstruction of
our purpose, forwhidltheS&B
is responsible. Mr. Doppelt‘s
implication was thatsome sin-
ister mistrust of the station
management or extraordinary
commitment to protect the
naive minds of the Grinnell
populous, prompted the “fre»
eze". Pure poppycock. He
made these assertions in spi-
to of the fact that, repeated-
1y, members of the board,
including myself emphasized
that no attackwas intendedand
no mistrust implied; and that
we were simply acting pursu-
ant to our desire to know more
about the station and its oper»
ation before we appropriated
the funds and locked them into
the radio station budget.

A student suggested to me
that the resolution ofthe issue
at themost recent boardmeec
ing was something of an antic
climax. In view of the S&B’s
sensationalism, he was cer
tainly correct. In View of the
feelings of those responsible
for the original motion, the
informational and acquiescent
tone of last Monday’s action
was not anti-climactic but ul-
timately consistent.

are still requested. These stu-
dents strongly feel that
schools are still discriminar
ting against them. Many ap-
pear close-mouthed in meir
photos. Many don't send their
pictures at all. And those who
fear the hard core repercus-
sions of prejudice discard the
braces before they enter col*
lege, destined to never re
turn to the straight and nar-
row.

Hiding their identity, most
who attend Grinnell know they
can compete with ether sttr
dents. Some feel they are
here as a result of tokenism.
They pledge that no quotas
or prejudices mar the paths
of the future braced. They de-
mand that the college recruit
students with braces and ad
mit them if they are qualir
fled. Because of the emotio-
nal ramifications, faculty ad-
visers and professors will be
needed to relate to these stu-
dents. The concerned braced
students also demandthatbra~
ced faculty recruitment ensue.
If one is qualified, he or she
should be hired.

The problem with these ad-
mirable objectives is that we
must search for a 25-year»
old black woman with braces.
And all this to fill a physics
vacancy.

"Big Brother"

To the Editors:

Last Februarya Big- Brother
and BigeSister Program.spo-
nsored by VISTA, made it
possible for quite a few child-
ren in town, who all really
needed an older friend, to be
matched up with a volunteer
from the college. Those of us
who joined the original pro
gram know all about the re-
wards and the problems both
of having a "little brother"
or "sister," but unfortunate-
ly there is no one presently
organizing any new volunteers
to meet the demand. Count~
less children who have been
signed up for the program by
their parents or their teachr
ers are impatiently waiting
for a friend from the college.

Apparently there are no
VISTA workers assigned to
Grinnell any more, and the
program has not been picked
up by anyone else. It's a
shame, but that’s not my main
concern. I would like only to
appeal to someone on campus
who would like to be a big
brother to a ten-year old boy
that I know who desperately
needs one. All he wants is
someone to play with him
once a week after school at
least. But you really have to
be certain that you want to
stick with it, because if you
get tired of it or don't have
time, he just won't understr
and.

My "little sister” just hap—
pens to be this boy’s real
sister, so I know his prob-
lems well. If someone would
please take an interest, may—
be I could give Ricky what he
really wants for his birthday- -
October 14--a big brether.
