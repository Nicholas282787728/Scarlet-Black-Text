Mahavishnu John McLaughlin Triumphs

by Scott Mason

When I first heard John McLaugh—
lin my immediate reaction was that
about halt the rock guitarists in the
world should sell tlleir Les Pauls
and give up in despair. McLaughlin
has combined complete mastery or
his instrument with an original and
exciting musical vision, a combinar
tion that iar surpasses most oiwhat
is being done in rock today As a
technician, he is equal to the finest
jazz guitarists playing today; among
the JRZTrFOCk set, only LarryCarye
ellapprochaes him in terms of abi-
lity and scope. What makes McLa»
ughlin unique, however, is that he
has gone beyone the technicallevel-
a level so many guitarists seem to
consider an end in itself-sand has
created what is possibly the finest
advanced rock music being played
today,

Though McLaughlin’s background
is heavily Jazz~orlented, having
played iwth Tonly William’s Life-
time, Miles Davis, and a variety
oi avantergarde English yazzmen,
the music he is playing on his iat-
est, and perhaps best album, inner
Mounting Flame, is rock, it any-

An alter the [act analysis oi the

elections this month would showthat
Voters across the country rarely
chose their favorite candidates on
the basis oi environmental issues.
If these had been the sole Criteria,
President Nixon would never have
seen reelected.

He must he oiie of the worst culr
prils in that old iorm oi thermalpor
llutlonnhot air. In other Words, N -
xon is lov on theatrical rhetoric
but short on substantial action. The
remark that probably best reflects

is action as Chief Executive was
made before the Detroit Economic
Club in 1971: “We are not going
to allow the environmental issue to
be used sometimes lalseiy and
sometimes in a demagogic way has-
ically to destroy the system...”

The Administration claims that it
set up iederal machinery to pros
tect the environment, cracked down

and urged a reluctant
to enact il‘s sweeping
tlatives The fact is that the “White

House" Council on Environmental
nuality was created by Congress
over the otuections oi Nixon himr
sell

Nixon did set up the Environmental
Protection Agency altcr pressure
was rising to establish :in EPA by
legislation Nixon also ordered
'reatiou of a National Industrial
Pollution Control Council, composed
of leading executive polluters, which
has worked as a powerful lobby for
weak environmental legislation

A major tool cited bV the Adminl~

thing. The musicians who compose
his band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra,
bring wpth them such a great var-
iety of influences that only a music
as open as rock can suitably ace
comodate them, On drums is Billy
Cobham, surely one of the finest
percussionists to emerge in the past
two years Though his playing style
is widely imitated by many jazz and
rock drummers today, his roots are
basically With soul music, having
played countless studio sessions in
the late Sixties. He spent sometime
with the jazz-rock band Dreams,and
contributed his talents to several
jazz albums, including one with Mc-
Laughlin and Coryell on the Vans
guard label. Violinist Jerry Good-
man of The Now Defunct Flock has
incorporated his years at classical

cal

stration toirnprovethequality oiwa.
ter is the 1899 Refuse Act, This
sturdy piece at law allows everycitr
izen to bring legal action against
water polluters by first determining
whether or not the polluter has an
Army Corps of Engineers permit
to discharge the effluents that he
is discharging. Then, it he does not,
the citizen brings evidence of the
illegal pollution to a federal pros
secutor. If the citizen wills hiscdse,
and a properly prepared case is
nearly foolproof, he collects half
oi the imposed line Nixon's Jus-
tice Department, rather than en—
coulaging prosecution, has repeate
edly sought to undermine the 1899
Reiuse Act by weak enforcement ins
strllctions to its prosecutors,

It is true that Congress has not
passed all oi the Presidents 50—
called sweeping proposals it is also
true that in most cases, Congress
is pushing ior tougher legislation
than the White House proposes and
that the President quite often on-
poses these stronger measures

incidentally, don't be surprised
it the Supersonic Transport finds a
place in the President’s next bud—

training into a unique style at solo
playing that complements McLaughv
lin’s heavier sound Austrian pianist
Jan l-lammer brings a touch oiece
lectic European jazz to the band,
while bassist Rick Laird has solid
roots in several English rockbahds.
The music on Inner Mountingrlame
is an often startling Combination of
all these influences, skillfully fused
and impeccably performed

Only a musician with an incredible
scope oi vision could hope to bring
influences like these together and
give them a deiinite unity and goal.
John McLaughlin is certainly such
a man, He is the composer or every
song on Inner Mounting Flame, and
his themetic imagination and grasp
of unusual rhythms give his works
a unique ﬂavor. His religious awak-
ening gives his music a spiritual
quality and direction, values thatare
lacking in hi earlier albums. Each
song on Inner Mounting Flame
churns with emotion, a strong
iorce that is handled superbly by
McLaughlin and the MahavishnuOr-
chestra,

The old adage that one listening
is worth 2i dozen reviews is finally
going to be put into effect, On Mon-

Pollution

get The SST, a pet proiect oi the
President, is probably on the verge
of’ being resurrected, ii Nixon
thinks he can muster enough “yes”
votes in Congress which previously
defeated funding for the plane, Ecolr
ogists have stated that the wide-
spread use of the SST will cause
global Climatic effects including a
decrease in the ozone layer of the
atmosphere which protects living
organisms from harmful llltravior
let radiation.

A pet project oi another politician
appears, however, to be heading tor
the wastebasket because of this
month’s election Mayor Richard J
Daley’s Chicago Crosstown Ex-
pressway has suitered a mortal
blow by the election of Dan Walker
for governor of Illinois The Antir

now make sure that Walker, who

ably against the Expressway, will
keep his initial promise,

Ecological Obscenity of the Month-
The government oi Belgulm is won-
dering what to do with 2000-3000
gallons of potassium cyanide, theorr
etically enough to kill everyone in
Europe. The toxic waste was dis—
covered alter nearby grass turned
brown, Cuts died, and Li stench as
or decomposing rats was noticed

A lax local government had allowed
the stuff to collect in an old warer
house. Some oi the deadly druins
lire lnarked “Orange Juice Concene

be that given on many such wastes,
that is, dump it ill the ocean

day night, from SIX to nine on KDIC
will be aired three hours of McLau-
ghlin’s music, irom his early days
to The Inner Mounting Flame For

East Street
Presents Iowa

Photographer

by John Benecki

Photolmagessby John Schultze,
East Street Gallery’s Show for N07
vembcr, is an excellent collectionof
prints and photOrcollages by John
Schultze, professor of photography
at the University or lowa.

Multiple images, tin cans, mirrors,
and old watches come together as
wholes that mean something, wholes
that express more than an artist’s
desire to appear innovative and ex-
perimental. Especially interesting
was “Peekaboo House”, a series
of [our different prints mounted in
such a way that they appear as one.
While most would be fascinated with
the mysterious glimpses aiiorded
through the many windows oi this
ghetto building, a photographer be-
comes particularly intrigued with
the depth»oi-iield paradoxes in the
print as a whole

Schultze’s “straight” prints are
equally delightiul, and show his great
Control over the medium, “Silent
Land" is a quiet, dim landscape with
pleasing grey tones and soft locus.
“Into Darkness’ is a study indepthr
of~fleld, where a woman’s hand,
resting on her knee, melts slowly
irom locus until her body is par
trayed in a vague, dark outline.
“Fluid Image” changes the human
body into ripples, ilowing across
the grey scale from black to white.
It would seem that ”Fluid Image”
is a multiple—negative print, and ap-
pears to be partially solerized, a
nice eitect in this print

”Phatoimages” is a show worth
seeing ior photographer and photo
ion as well, being an interesting
expression or one photographer's
perception oi reality and the photo—
graphic medium,

'Don’t Blame Me, I’m From D.C.’

by Jack Doppelt
run a n i.
wanna

There are all kinds of ways to
look at this election, not the least
of which is down, On the other hand,
as the famous philosopher Muscrat
Ben Woodstock once said, “There
is always a little heaven in a dis»
aster area,"

So, in turning my attention to the
pearly gates, l iound a iew rainr
bows. They appeared over some
Congressional, Senatorial, and 107
cal races, and Over the swarm of
voters who conscientiously split
their ballots; not over the Presi—
dential flood That was somewhere
over the rainbow

There was little lost George who
came from a little farm town in
the West looking for OZ He was
swept away ii-om home by a tornado
of discontent. Before he knew it,
he touched down in a strange land
called Pry Mary, As a result of the
storm, he landed on the wicked
witch of the East and killed her
And nothing has been made perr
fectly clear since then

Then, With a hurry oi titlst, her
sister, the wicked witch of the Wess
tern White House, appeared. Andshe
wus meaner and more ruthless than
her older sister. She vowed to (1657
troy him and anyone who helped him.
That meant all the Mllnchkins that
little Goerge llztd befriended,

Little George was blessed by the
good witch who came all the way
from Ilyunnispol‘t to tell him that
she couldn't accompany him to Oz.
So George and his Munchkin fol-
lowers started out for OZ But as
soon as they reached the outskirts
oi Pry Mary, all the Muchkins hall
to turn back. They had school the
next day. Anti the trip seemed long
and hopeless. With tears ill their
eyes, they waved goobye and told
George to iollow the yellow brick
road
George iollowcd it as tar as it
wollld go, but it nnrrowcduntil there
was no outlet. no way to turn, The
wicked witch had takeil the yellow
brick road to see the Chairman
of OZ, and find barricaded the past
behind him, But George trudged
along no matter how flitile No
one showed up in help him
There was no scarecrow, He had
toned down and wasn't scaring away
any people any more Although he

still didn’t have a brain he hid it
a lot better beneath the straw. While
the crows wer cawing, “Four more
years,” the scarecrow was think-
ing, “In (our more years.”

There was no tin man. True, he
had been left out there to rust,
but only because he went into the
iorest without telling anyone, There
is still a great deal of specualtion
about how Sick he really was irom
being stuck in the forest so long.
George was hinting ior 02, the tin
man just stood at the Side of the
road, so everyone could see hisprer
dlcament and sympathize with him.
And there came no cowardly lion.
He had been king of the forest but
had lost his courage a tow years
ago. When he wbuldn’t come out

Washington
Report

and light lie had grown a long
mane and it appeared that he would
aid little George, But he was still
mad at George ior not supporting
him in his battle in the Jungle.

And there was no little dog com-
panion, Checkers. He was a giit
irom a little girl but had died and
been buried long ago. George tried
to replace Checkers with police
dogs, a Russian basset hound called
Wheatie, a watchdog, a poodle that
kept chasing milkmen, a hound, and
a retriever that buried bones as
quickly as it could iind them, But
no one paid any attention it inst
wasn’t Checkers

The character that George missd
the most, the wicked witch herseli,
never came out to get him. And what
good is a iairy tale when the witch
stays home? The only way little
George could get into Oz was by
capturing the witch’s broomstick,
but George never even had a chance
to throw Watergate at her,

So, little George never got there.
But he knows which path led him
astray. For now, he just tapped his
heels three times and repeated
“There's no place like home,
America,"

And "Pooh“ he was back in D c.
