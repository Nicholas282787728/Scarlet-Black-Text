The communique oi' the 27th was ill-conceived, mis-written, rhetorically

such as this is really “structured

CBS has mobilized the laculty against
that can be changed

I spent hours nervously attempting to unravel those cyptograms CBS
calls sentences, Unvaryingly one word is used to do the duty of 10. There
is so much under the surtace that when you tinally get down to it, Ablerr
Woodworth have long since iaded trom view as principle iigures. They
become symbols in a microcosmic allegory. Itall started two years ago....

Some people were incubator babies, 1 was a library baby. lhave otten
sworn that I was born in Burhng basement guarding a back door {or the
period of an hour after 39 hrs without Sleep. The Administration negoti-
ated once we got out or therefbut despite their promises or good taith,
reneged on every last article they agreed to accomodate. This way my
introduction to the Grinnell political structure. My_baptism oi lire came
when acting as Aide-de-camp to Russ McGregor, the head of the CBS
Black Library Committee, I found myself skewered because the knife
someone stuck in his back was too long. That was my gilded youth when

Grinneil taught me that radical politics don’t pay.

Then last year came the cluster system hassle, a battle over whether
black students as a minority should be allowed to live together or it they
should- be spread evenly over campus so that everyone can enjoy their ne-

gritude. All goes to show you, conventional politics don't pay

particularly to John Turnbull and
Louise' Dix, for one 01 the ﬁnest
pieces or investigative Journalism
that the $813 has published in a
long, long time. I'm reterring, or
course, to the excellent article a
bout the Health Center in last We~ l
ek’s edition, the first in whatl hope
will be just as excellent a ser-
ies. The plethora oi iacts and fig
ures which the article included anr
swered questions which most stu-
dents have all one time or another,
but which few at us take the effort
to answer ourselves. Again, John
and Louise, thanks for a great are
ticle.

The excellence ot the article,howA
ever, should not detract lrom the
importance or its contents The
Health Center has been a target tor
ridicule and runny lokes tor as long

i sprain my ankle (I did sprain my
ankle last semester and borrowed
my appropriate crutches and ban»
dage which Iduly returned 2 weeks
later. I received a rather sternnote
trom the Health Center a couple
of weeks ago asking me it I wanted
to return my bandage, or “would
I rather pay the Health 'Center
$1.00 tor it?); 4) call up a doctor
[or me to make an appointment,
in case, I suppose, my hand is
sprained and i can’t dial myseit.
The other largest sum or money ,
321,000 - goes for health insurance.
Even though my‘parens‘ insurance
covers me while I’m at school
it's reassuring that Grinnell cares
enough about me to torce me to
pay $16 {or health insurance just so
that I will have double coverage.
I’ve gota sneaking suspicion,though,

{or an average student’s need?"

Salaries {or the nurses and the
insurance cost $50,705 this year. It
Grinnell eliminated those two major
costs, I could pay out the $2.50 for
a pack ol Triaminicin, I could still
borrow an Ace bandage and atpair
DI crutches from the students who
work at the Health Center, and
I could call Dr. Ferguson directly
and make my own appointment.

It is rather insulting to realize
that the Administration has notbeen
willing to take an active initiative
in trying to do something about the
regrettable role of the Health Cen—
ter at Grillneli. Surely, they have
heard the rumors, and could have
done as much digging for informa—
tion as John Turnbuu has done.
For that matter, they probably could
have obtained the statistics much

Last year the administration cut the Communications major. This year
the sociology department iaculty was cut to a husband and wife team

. in my honor these iacts were mentioned. “Until a few years ago sociology
and anthropology were considered the same thing,” said one or the spokes-
men and in the recess or my mind bells chimed with deatening charm,
Realization: What would the administration do it they wished to continue
to cut back departments alter they kill the religious shidles department?

I’m here, I’m not going to be paid

I must admit that I’m gladl'mnnder

that it I ever have a kidney re-

Could not the sociology department, it sutticiently compromised, be re»

united with the Anthro department?

Now we come to the question or how to implement this notion. son, EPC,
etc. are not built to get anything done, They are built to keep student
politicos so busy issuing pet tags that they don't realize what is going
down. The taculty doesn’t listen to what students say not only because
they are young jerks, but transients as well And the Executive Council
are so busy looking at a “Big Picture” that is so big they can’tsee all
the students hanging lrom Herrick. So what are people to do? Fold their

hands sit on them?

Somehow you can tlnd a little heroism in the communique. (that is, it
you dig deeply enough and consider sell—immoiation a torm otheroism),
Very little. What you tind in much greater quantities is salt to throw into
your wounds, wounds that ’already burn like the sun. You begin to realize
that at Grinneli you are gaining a knowledge oi the impotence and tutility
that will be shackled to your lite until you die. Yet these people when raced
by selieservutg bureaucracies which lett them with no constructive,
logical and ettective alternatives struck out against their oppressor in the
must selirdestructive, illogical and ineltective manner. Such a course
takes some guts. And lots oi insanity, Maybe insanity will work. We've

WASPS: Want Own Ethnic

To the Editors:

it has come to our attention that
a mayor ethnic group within Grill-
hell's student body has escaped
public recognition, No specialized
“Cultural awareness" weekends
have been provided tor this substan—
tial tacticn This grave oversight
has caused a major ethnic identity
crisis among these students, hamr
pering their ettectiveness within the
Grinnell community and the world
at large. Clearly these students are
in need oi tirm leadership and are-
gulated exposure to their now unr
popular oiigins.

We speak, obviously, otthe WASP
student body. The wasp at Grinnell
is perhaps the most culturally tie»

that it an event isn’t specitically

to cloak their identity by tinting
