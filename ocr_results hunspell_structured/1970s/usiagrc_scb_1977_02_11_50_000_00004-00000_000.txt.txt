How much
longer will

we drift?

Right now the college is suffering from a lack of leader-
ship. President Turner has largely disassociated himself
from an examination of the future direction of the college. At
Monday’s faculty meeting, he told those present that he was
changing his plans. Instead of taking the initiative for
discussion about the future of the college himself, he has
thrown the ball back to the rest of the campus community,
saying they are free to come up with ideas and suggestions.

Why the change? Is he stalling for time while he thinks of
another plan? Did he take this step because he didn't know
what else to do? Is he sincerely interested in offering the
community a viable channel for input? Is he tired of taking
the ﬂack? What role did the trustees play in Turner's new
approach'.7

Turner has taken himself out of 'the limelight. The
question now is whether anyone will provide leadership;
whether the campus will regroup itself in a way that allows
constructive planning for the future. '

The faculty will play an important role in the next few
weeks, as they appear to be the group most likely to take the
lead. It remains to be seen Whether they are willing to take
advantage of this opportunity to offer some direction to the
college.

The students, too, may take some action in providing a
sense of direction for the college. However, this appears less
likely and less feasible, as they are only four year residents at
the college.

Above all, remains the question of the President’s position.

. Will he be able to lead in the future? Or will the over
whelmingly negative campus reaction to his “White Paper”
continue to hinderhis willingness.and ability to lead the

college?

um...

Abolish honors program

by Ruth Montgomery
In one hundred and three days
those of us who call ourselves
seniors hope to be preparing to
receive the certiﬁcate of com-
pletion of a liberal arts education
granted by Grinnell College. it our
class follows the pattern of iLs
predecessor, slightly over one
fourth of our peers will be listed in
the graduation program and in
next year’s Bulletin as members of
that select group referred to as
“candidates for the degree with
honors in the major field." For
many, this will be the first time
they realize that such an elite
exists at Grinnell. Parents will
point and be proud. and certainly
this honor will appear on one‘s
transcript, but what will it mean?
Just what will you and the others in
that select one quarter have that
the other three quarters don't?
Fortunately the Bulletin
provides an answer to this
dilemma on page 43, “Each
department may recommend for
graduation with honors those
senior majors who have clearly
distinguished themselves within
their major field of study. In order
to qualify for recommendation a
student must, on the basis of seven
semesters of college work, have
achieved at least a 3.4 grade-point
average in the major field and ﬂ
cumulative graderpoinf average of
3.2. These are the minimum
standards for recommcdation and
should not be regarded by the
department as the sole criteria.
Departmental recommendations
for graduation with honors must be
approved by the Dean of the
College.” That certainly makes the

Christianity and
fellowship?

To the Editor: I have talked to
so many people on this campus
that criticize Christianity because
of their experiences with the
Grinnell Christian Fellowship that
I must write this letter to implore
others not to abandon an essen-
tially beautilul thing because of
the corrupt wrapper it appears to
be in at Gl‘lnnell.

I have been a small group leader
and participated in Blble studies of
the Christian Fellowship. I found
there a bigoted, holier than thou
attitude that was steeped in
egotism and elitism Following
their evangelical lendencies.the
Fellowship certainly wants you but
they want you only on their own
terms when I talk to individual
Christians on campus 1 am pleased
to find an overall loving attitude
towards humanity as a whole, but
then I am confronted by the
bureaucratic leaders of the
Fellowship, who are so unsure of
their own calling that they must
build great walls between the ”us”
and the “lhey ”

I find this whole ”proud to be one
of the chosen" trip totally
disgusting and have tried to talk at
length to the head of the team
leaders but he doesn't listen. As co»
editor of the Christian newsletter,
“The Intercom," I tried to get my
point across but the article was
banned from publication

Like any fanatical group they
don't want adVlce, only power
This is not what Christianity is all
about I’m not going to sermonize
about Christianity; I would just
like to encourage people to look
seriously at the Gospels for a true
understanding of Christianity.

Our honors
. well it
. let me

matter clearer
program obviously . .

clearly is intended to . .
read that passage again,

At a faculty meeting last
semester shortly after the faculty
voted down the “new, improved"
honors proposal submitted by the
Curriculum Committee, Mr.
Cleaver proposed that the faculty
abolish the honors program
altogether. Prior to voting on the
matter. the faculty requested that
students be consulted as to the
merit of the honors program.
Currently, the EPC members on
the Curriculum Council are
checking with studenm in their
departments and Joint Board
representatives are bringing the
matter up with their halls,

There are two major questions to
be asked in the consideration of the
honors program. The first is does
our current system etfectively
establish a standard against which
students can be measured and
compared? That it does not is
evidenced by last year's proposal

Faifer’s

To the Editor: Faifcr's Theory:
There Exists An lnvcrse
Relationship Between Intellectual
Development and Respect For
Private Property. ,

This theory assumes that as a
child develops his-her intellect, his»
her respect for private property
deteriorates. As I look back on my
days in the lower levels of grain
mar school, I can recall taking
books from a shelf of the library
and enjoying clean margins, free
of markings from intruders.
During my advancement from
these levels, the treat of finding an
unaltered book diminished. By thi
time I reached high school, tht
margins of library books
belonging to the entire high schoo.
community, were spattered with
sketchings, profanity and other
comments

Now as I look through the books
in the Grinnell College library,
especially those on the reserve
reading lists, I find that the
students of Grinnell have outdone
the high school students by

to stiffen and standardize
the requirements for an honors
major. it was hoped that a more
equitable basis of comparison
could be established. It is felt by
many students and faculty that the
current system establishes an
unfair and inaccurate segregation
between students,

The second, and more important,
question is, is this standard of
comparison needed? Here again
the answer is no. The Bulleti
states on page 7 that the philosophy
behind a Grinnell education “ . .
prizes knowledge as an end to be
pursued for i5 own sake. . .” In
such an environment the
designation of an honors elite by
the college is inappropriate,

I suspect that the general
reaction to any discussion of the
honors program will be a yawn. It
certainly seems to mean little to
most, even on graduation day.
There seem to be few reasons to
retain this generally meaningless
system and a number of reasons to
remove it. Let’s urge its removal,

distorting the print as well as the
margins. (For examples see
reserved reading under No, 572
k69m , Mirror for Man, pp. 17-44
and No. 901 W575 - The Science of
Culture, pp. 25-48.) I therefore
must draw the conclusion that at
this stage of intellectual
development there exists a great
disrespect for the private property
which belongs to the entire
Grinnell College Community.

Perhaps the reason for this
defacing of library materials is‘
that the students gain more con
fidence in their intellectual
abilities and feel the need to axe
press their thought beside thos .,
who have expressed thoughts on
the printed page. Or perhaps there
is no longer enough space on the
walls of thc washrooms and they
seek to flnd another medium of
selfrexpression.

1 know you, the student body of
Grinnell. will say that my theory is
unfounded and unproven, but
would you like to disprove it'l
