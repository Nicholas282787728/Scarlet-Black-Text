over another team was that I liked

Coping with Grinnell’s paper problems

During the 197849 academic year,
organizations at the college used over
680.000 sheets of paper. Not all of this
was distributed to the student body,
but then the ﬁgure does not include
the amount at paper used for
academic purposes Tens of thousands
of these sheets did make their way in-
to the student mailboxes. It was not,
and is still not, unusual to see hun—
dreds of these pamphlets and adver-
tisements discarded in the waste
basket each week, without ever being
read.

The paper waste is obvious, but the
problem is more encompassing than
that. In speaking to the postmaster, it
was learned that extra help had to be
hired just to stuff the great volume of
paper received each day. Also, energy
is wasted each time a less than
universally desired announcement is
printed, not only the energy needed to
print it. but also the energy needed to
'originally produce the paper.

Further waste exists in the form of
pollution, a byproduct of the paper
mill manufacturing the paper, This
breakdown could be continued further,
but the point is simpleea terrific
volume of paper, time, energy, and
money is wasted each year at Grins
nell due to inefficient paper usage.

Members of IPIRG, and other line
terested students, have been working
on this problem. There are two basic
ways we hope to help alleviate the
paper waste: (1) rearrange the struc-
ture of the post office and (2) institute
a paper recycling plan.

Ideas for changing the post office

stucture are as follows: Organizations
would no longer stuff mailboxes with
their announcements. instead, enclos»
ed bulletin board space in the post at
fice would be provided for any
organization desiring it. Their
bulletins would be posted in this space
for people to read.

in addition to this, a box containing /
extra pamphlets would be placed I
under the announcement for those in-
dividuals desiring their own copy. The
bulletin boards would be cared for by
the post office personnel.

Some organizations, such as Career
Services, would further advertise by:
(l) distributing the bulletin to
everyone for the first three weeks
each semester and requesting
subscriptions for future issues; (2)
providing extra copies in each of the
dining halls; <3) posting Copies in the
residence halls (with the aid of SAS),
dining halls, and the academic depart-
merits.

of course, stuffing the mailboxes
may be appropriate in, some cases,
this is left to the individual group. We
realize that this method will require
additional effort on the students part
to be adequately informed, but this
slight inconvenience should be far
outweighed by the savings in paper,
etc.

Thus far, Career Seerces, KDIC,
and SGA have agreed to such a pro-
posal, and we urge other organizations
and the administration to follow suit.

Even with the changes in the post
office, there will still be a large quan-
tity of paper used. There is a need to

On imperialism and the Mideast problems

To the editor: Not long ago I read
an editorial in the October 16 issue of
the Des Moines Register which was
somehow frightening. It was about a
man familiar to some of us, a
Republican and a Texan named John
Connally.

The editorial dealt with a speech
recently made by Connally which is
probably familiar to most of us by
now—that in which he proposed a per-
manent Mideast solution by which
Israel would give up the Golan
Heights, Jerusalem, and the west
bank of the Jordan river, the latter to
an “entirely independent entity,"
presumably the United States, in
return for “ironclad" promises for

14

peace, and the “strong military
presence” of the United States.

Needless to say, Connally’s speech
brought some political repercussions.
Not only was the proposal unrealistic,
but actually offensive to many who
value Israel's sovereignty. Moreover,
the magnitude of the implied expan-
sion of U.S. military presence smacks
of the imperialistic attitude of two
decades past.

The proposal seems so drastic, so
absurd as a foriegn policy expedient,
that one almost questions the true
motive behind it. Any speech which
hints at a freer, more secure flow of
oil which would ostensibly follow from

recycle this. Ruth Pitner has worked
with a local Boy Scout Explorer Post
to establish a paper recycling pro
gram.

They will accept all paper free of
foreign objects (i.e., staples) ex»
cluding magazine paper. Magazine
paper is not considered profitable to
recycle as the process weakens the
fiber to such a degree that it renders
the product useless. To assist in this
drive, we ask that you save all paper
and deposit it into one of the boxes
located on the first floor of each dorm.
There will be efforts made to also
have a bin located in the post office.
The paper will be bundled each week
and then stored until it can be picked
up by members of the Explorer Post.

There are several things that you
can do to help make these programs
more successful.

whenever possible, incorporate an-
nouncements in the Memo If you are
a professor, please avoid giving
handouts that only depict illustrations
and information that is available in
the textbook.

Everybody, please bear wim the
changes in the post office and accept
your responsibility to become inform-
ed. Utilize both sides of a sheet of
paper before discarding it, and then
deposit it into a recycling box.

Finally, Ruth (23673375) can use
some assistance with the tying of
bundles and carrying them to their
respective storage rooms each week.
All of your efforts will be greatly ap-
preciated.

the combination of such appeasement
of OPEC with such military presence
in the area would turn not only the
heads of corporate power which
already look to him as the avowed
crusader of wealth, but also those of
the average gasolinehungry citizen
Were this the case. Connally would
be no more guilty than any other
politician who knows his craft well,
But no; as William‘Saiire, the man
