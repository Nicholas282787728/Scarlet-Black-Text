Pioneers 6-0

by Justin Case

A strong Pioneer defense held the
Carleton Carls to a mere six points
last Saturday, but the squad still
tumbled to its second straight con-
ference loss, as a sloppy Grinnell
oftense was frozen out of the score
column, though presented with at
least three good opportunities to
crack the ice

Early in the first quarter, Grinr
nell’s Tom Kalhorn recovered a
Carleton fumble on the Carls‘ 17-
yard line. After pressing down to
the five yard line, the ball was
driven back to the twenty, A field
goal attempt from the 27 yard line
was then wide to the right.

Soon afterwards, Carleton wasfnrr
ced to punt and Grinnell took pos—
session on the opposiiion’s 45, Wash
Alston’s running cappedadrive down
to the 13. There was a fumble on
the next play, however, and Carle»
ton recovered the ball.

Then late in the second quarter
the Pioneers finally began to put
it all together, Augmented by the
passing of quarterback Jeff Dick,
the offense advanced the ball more
than so yards, down to the Carler
ton 26. However, with lo seconds
left in the half, a questionable cal
on a fourth down play may havecost
the Pioneers a few points.

instead of going for the field goal,
which, if successful, wouldnaveiied
the game attllreeaplece,the coaches
decided to try for a first down or
the touchdown. But the Carls stopv
ped a play on the ground andthe half
ended with Carleton ahead 370.

There was very little action of any
consequence in the second half ex-
cept for another Carleton field goal
and a tricky lateral play executed
with great proficiency by the desr
perale pioneers in the final seconds
of the game They were able to
penetrate deep into the opposition's
zone but not quite deep enough.

SoccerSireaks I To Second Place

by Dave Calvert

In a strong defensive effort the
Grinnell soccer team avenged the
football team by trouncing Monmouth
4-0 Saturday in Monmouth, Illinois‘.
Although not a conference game, the
win boosted the Pioneer record to
Z-l with both Victories comingonthe
road. It was the Scots' first loss,
against one win.

Early in the contest both squads
failed to capitalize on their scoring
opportunities. The first score was
provided by goalie-halfback-for-
ward Tom Graumin,wlth Pete Horo-
witz getting the assist, Soon after
ward, Pete Shearer scored on a
breakaway andthe half ended with the
score at 2»0,

After halftime which was high-
lighted hyrefreshments furnished by
Mark “DJ." Hanlsch, Coach VidEr
tich substituted freely. With all 22
Pioneer players seeing action, the
offense scored twice more and the
defense held tight. LesOse, assisted

y.iimn uv Julie Dunn

by Horowitz, boomed in the first
of the second half goals and Gran-
miii netted the other in scoring his
second of the day.

The key to the Win was the tough-
ness and Consistency of the defense.
The outstanding play of fullbacks
Roger kumler, Glenn Cushing, and
Karl Von Orsdol made it relatively
easy for firstryear goalie Tim
Havens to record the first shutout
of the season, in three games Grinr
hall has allowed only 4 goals, while
scoring 12

Although the second place Pioneers
do not play conference leading Knox
again until October 21, the Men—
mouth coach confided to this report»
er that the Scots “always do Well
against Knox." Monmouth plays
Knox tomorrow. Grinnell plays its
second home game tomorrow, tak
ing on the Rams from Cornell. The
game will take place at the soccer
field (behind the Norrises) at 1:30.

Gursi (The Eagle) Revisited

 

in 1943 when men were men, women
were women, and “Japs” were
“rapped” in the stately Scarlet and
Black, newly constructed Cowles
Hall, then occupied by the First and
Second Divisions of Grinnell'sarmy
trainees, was the first proud perch
of Garst, the 273 pound castriron
eagle. Garst’s 30 year history ended
on Tuesday the 27th of last week
Garst was stolen while the mist
still carressed the grass and the
numerous and varied doggy done»
its on voluptuous Mac Field. The
ten year North Campus rivalry sorr
rowfully ended when six Gates freshr
men dumped Garst into the deep and
Murckey waters of Rockcreek Lake,

The durable eagle was one ofmany
cast for the United States Army
during the Second World War by the
Pendletonrloseph Clarion Bell
Company of Tintinnabulation, Wy-
oming. The plant had been con»
verted from hell construction to the
production of heroic statues.
Garst was given to the school by
Lt. Gen. McNally Cowles, no rela-
tionship to the men after whom the
hall orthe supermarketwere named.
The lonely eagle was secured onto
the new structure by three bolts,
just below the Sundial, much to the
chagrin of the obviously inspired
architect who Said: “Putting Such
gingerbread on a classically sleek
structure makes my gorge rise."
Gorge or no, when the army left
the relieved eagle remained on ci-
vilian Cowles. Thelofty bird silently
melted there until he was removed
in 1960. In the 1962 cyclone he was
pictured with pipe-in-beak,
“COWLES" tattooed across his
chest, surrounded by liqueur bottles
and various less-thanrdignlfied per~
sonages.

The ten year rivalry began whenhe
was mistaken for one of the Cowles
preps, stolen by Clark Hail and
then tarred and feathered. Cowles
immediately retaliated with the most
titanic water fight ever seen west
of the Mississippi. This rivalry
continued until 1971 when tradition
was broken by freshmen from
Cowles Hall who in a fuddle-headed
state, removed the startled eagle
to Rawson tower. Thestatne,yanked
from a second ﬂoor Clark radiator,
where it was secured with a thin
bicycle chain, cascaded down the
Clark stairway, chipped off pieces
of these stairs, and woke most
everyone up during its voyage to
Rawson. The girls of Rawson sur-
prised wlth their new possession,
promptly renamed the winsorne
eagle “Roslyn”.

Roswald Garst, the noble eagle,
was originally named after Rose
wald Garst, the farmer, who is best
known for telling Nikita Kruschev
how to decollectivize, sell wheat
to Russia, and raise the price of
bread at home, (The rumor that
he now serves in Washington as an
aide to Earl Butz is a bald-faced
rumor.) Garst who, like all of Grill-
nell in 1943, was originally lily
white, was painted Rocky Mountain
Blue (see Denver, ionn, second al—
bum) in 1971 by the incorruptihle
Rawsan woman Some of the old
guard in Clark gave the embarras-
ed eagle a shower and, fortunately

GARST before demise

the paint washed off. The Rawson
women proceeded to emasculate
Clark by stealing the television and
sadistically keeping it through
“Night Gallery." After much can
fusion both the eagle and the tele-

_vision returned to Clark, and rap-

prochment was achieved in the form
of a “kegger”, held inClark lounge.
Rumor has it that the indomitable
eagle was stolen last year by six
incensed freshmen women from
third {1002‘ Gates Hall; where Garst
was miraculously recovered this
year painted an appalling dayrglo
pink with gold beak and talons.
Last week there was a threat by
Smith Hall degenerates to further
break tradition by removing Garst
to the third floor of that hall. Their
efforts were thwarted by studious
Gates freshmen who decided it was
much more rational to dump the
eagle in the aforementioned lake,
thereby ending a Grinnell tradition
and frightening countless watery
creatures. Garst was transported to
the lake inawhitevolkswagon named
“Ludwig Van” ironically borrowed
from a member of Smith Hall.
Contrary to popular belief Garst
was the one and the only eagle of
this type who ever perched on the
Grinnell campus. This columnist, in
an attempt to locate a similar bird,
contacted the Pendleton-Joseph
Company only to find that both the
company and the town of Tintinna-
hulation had been sold to the Sin-
clair Oil Company, where six on
derricks and one large plastic bron-
losaurus are now‘located. Which
leads this columnist to say as the
Grinneii General and his Orderly
once said: “Aren‘t things Just ducky
here at Grinnell?”
