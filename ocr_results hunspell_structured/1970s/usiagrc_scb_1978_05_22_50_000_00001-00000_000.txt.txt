Last Wednesday, I discovered
the worth of my college career.
There weren’t any trumpets or
angels , , just a subtle, solid
feeling of selfrsatisfaction,

i spent Wednesday comparing
the day's events with memories oi
high school, The high school part
was little short oi a nightmare, but
that’s why i ieel so good about
college, In four years at Grinnell, I
changed The catch was that it
happened so slowly i never
realized it until Wednesday
’That morning alter being
thoroughly aggravated by on
article , cwhcre advocating
strong iii motive LIClmm I
remembered that in high school i
hail hated politics. Yet I knew

’ minis

enough to know there was little
difference between absurdity and
conservatism. Four years later,
I'm a political science major and
think that liberalism Couldn’t hold
a match to conservative Stands on
a lot of issues

Wednesday aiternoon, I got a
lousy grade on one oi the best
papers I ever wrote in high school,
I would have bashed something
expensive off the side wall But last
Wednesday 1 was only a little
bothered When you put in hard
work, have learned something and
believe that what you have done is
good, a grade really doesn't matter
that much

In the evening, I ate dinner
with a large group oi iriends 1 can
count the number of friends 1 now
have left from high School on one
hand, With fingers left over. My
Gl'lnnell friends. I somehow feel,
will be with me tor a long, long
time. In four years, I learned to
make friends.

So is all at this satisfaction the
result oi the “Grinnell Ex-
perience’” Not a chance. At
Grinnell. you don't ”experience"
anything. except perhaps a steady
stream of semirworthless
homework interrupted only by
periods oi high academic pressure,
I did not passively experience
Gi'innell I used it.

i joined the 8&8, played on the
tennis team. served on the political
science EPC. I went to lectures.
dlked with- teachers bind ads
tnrs, read unassigned
parls of books. Above all. I used
social events to make and enjoy
my iriends. And uccasmnally l

 

went to SGA meetings, for my'
masochistic tendencies. Not all of
this I did well or completely, so I
don't think I’m backrpatting. But i
did try to take advantage of
Grinnell,

The problem With Grinnell is that
a lot oi people don't seem to ape
prove oi what I tried to do. Why do
faculty members insist on a steady
barrage oi homework? ii they
would chop ten minutes oii of
reading assignments. students
might put rive oi those into
relaxing and iive into better
analysis of the materials We'd all
be better off

Why does the administration
pay so little attention to EPC's'!
Why do students degrade SGA by
stuiiing ballot boxes and voting
[or dogs?

I guess the only solution ior
people trying to take lull ad
vantage oi Grlnnell is to create
their own positive reinforcement.
Consider the 5&8. The academic
credit. salaries and recognition are
so small you wonder why anyone
might do it But I wouldn‘t trade
the occasional kind comments
about a good issue or the romp to
the printers through two feet or
Virgin snow at 5 on a.m loi-

If you ever attended summer
camp you probably have memories
like mine

when l arrived at the beginning
of the camp season. I saw a lot of

obviously been there in previous

I have often thought of Grinnell
as a summer camp oi’ [our years'

duration. Some of my most
pleasant Grinnell memories
surround Skip Day, and the
thousand-odd Snickem candy bars
I’ve given away over the years,
Like summer camp, Grinnell is a
place where vie spend some time,
have pleasant experiences to
remember, and end up, perhaps.
no closer to or no better prepared
for whatever comes next, Of
course. the stated purpose or
Grinnell is to provide a liberal arts
education.

Just what is a liberal arts
education lor” How am I better for
it? I am not the first [0 35k such
questions. nor will I provide any
new answers in lhis article The
tired old answers are probably the
best onesi a person can mature in
a good environment, become
rounded intellectually. and maybe
learn some mathematics or
philosophy besides, And it would
seem that it is hard to do all ol that
anywhere but at u liberal arts
college.

So perhaps I'll setvaSide the
summer camp analogy as too
harsh On balance. I think well of
