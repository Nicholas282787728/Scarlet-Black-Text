Women cancel basketball season;

The‘ nearly insurmountable
problems facing the women’s
basketball team at the start of the
season became insurmountable
this past week as the team was
hard hit by losses to its starting
five players. Cathy Lee, Cathy

Despite the Christmas spirit that
pervaded most of last month. the
_ basketball Pioneers found little to
be joyous about as they lost all five
of their December games. Aiter
another loss in the in' a] January
contest. the cagers iinally won,
over Knox last week, 7441, thanks
mostly to a strong showing by
Pioneer reserves. Grinnell's
overall record now stands a 27.

After losing at home to wi am
Penn on Dec. 2, the Pioneers
started a fivesgame road trip at
Ripon Tired by a long journey,
Grinnell was no match for the hot
shooting Redmen, The opponents
opened up a 15vpointhall‘time lead
and continued the barrage ior a ea-
73 Win,

"They outran us,” head coach
Ron Mitchell said. “Fastbreak
afler break after break alter
break. They must have scored ten
laysups on breaks. No team will
ever do that again, We couldn’t run
with them ”

Ripon grabbed almost twice as
many rebounds as the Pioneers,
Grinnell’s top rebounder was a
guard. Carl Warner. The Pioneers'
scoring was lopsided, with Warner
and John Halgh making almost
two-thirds of the team's output

The next night against
Lawrence, it was a case of “close
hul no cigar.” Holding an lispoint
lead with ten minutes left, Grinnell
was ready to light up. But a ilood of
Lawrence free throws washed
away the lead and the Vikings won,
78-75

Mitchell thought Lawrence,
which played without its top
player, had cxtrzr help “It's tough
to beat scvcn peopleifivc players
and two offiClals," he said, “I
won’t say this is the worst (ols

another this semester cutting the
squad to seven, mostly inexs
perienced players. As a result, the
team has cancelled the remainder
of their games and will continue
practicing only a iew days each
Week.

Coach Sandy Hoth explained that
Grinnell just did not have the
experience necessary to be
competitive in intercollegiate play,

especially aiter the loss oi the
three women. “We were a
beginning-intermediate level
basketball team trying to compete
against experienced in
tercollegiate squads," Hoth said.

Serious doubts are hovering over
the future of the Women's
basketball program because this is
the second year in a row that the
women have been forced to cancel

Women too

come home

by Dave Schrchter

Having spent last week swims
ming two practices a day the
women’s swim team is loo iig
iorward to competition tomoliow
at Knox. The Pioneer women
whipped Knox last year and Coach
Mike Daley is looking forward ‘1
repeat performance tomorrow,

The training during the iinal
week oi winter break was intense,
the team swimming 9,500 yards 3
day. As a result, Daley feels i.
the squad is in "excellent physical
Condition,” About tomorrow's
meet Daley said, “We need it
mentally because people who are
in it ior competition purposes need
to get something out ofit (after last
week’s twice a day workouts)".

Next week the women host the
University of Northern Iowa at the
beginning oi a three meet home
stand. On Feb, 6 Luther will apmir
at the PEC for a dual meet and the
next day is the Miracle Relays,
which Grinnell won last year.

the bulk of their season. Dif-
ferences are evident within the
Physical Education Department as
to what should become of the
women’s basketball program.
Hoth stated that the program
should be discontinued in the near
future and then reevaluated in four
or five years, She said that
Women’s basketball programs are

it's close to the worstNHe added‘
“Despite that (the officiating). we
still should have won,”

Particularly outstanding ior
Grinnell was senirr forward Jeff
Fallon, wholed the team in scoring
and rebounding with 24 points, a
career-high, and 12 grabs off the
boards.

Abouttwo weeks later, the squad
was in Illinois for the four-team
Chicago Holiday Tournament. In
the first round, Grinnell drew

The Pioneersstnp point man this
season. John Haigh, who had
practiced just a halt day that week,
scored far below his average with
12 points. Mitchell said, “As far as
I’m concerned, he (Haigh) stunk
the joint out.” Warner continued
his hot scoring pace with a team-
high is points.

In the consolation game, Grins
nell’s poor shooting was an early
Christmas present ior Colorado
College as the Scarlet and Black
lost, 93-76. The Pioneers shot just
31 per cent irom the floor and
Colorado grabbed an impressive 67
rebounds.

Mitchell said the team’s poor
overall showing in the tournament,
which was won by Chicago, was
due to the lzsday layoii during iirst
semester examinations. He said
the timing oi the tournament was
inconvenient for Grinnell and
predicted that the college will soon
drop out.

1976 started out looking like a
continuation oi 1975 as Chicago
claimcd its second win over
Grinnell, 8943, last week in
Illinois, But the win came harder.
The Pioneers kept close until five

straight Grlnneil turnovers in the
second half led to ten Maroon
points and what had been a seven-
point margin for Chicago became
an unbeatable 17-point lead,

Grinnell played last year's coA
champion Knox the next night, in
only the second home game of the
season, In front of a near-capacity
crowd, the Pioneers fell behind 23,
13 before outscoring the Siwashers
2540 to take a lead at intermission.
The comeback was made with four
starters on the bench. Only Haigh
was left in to team with subs Paul
Delaney, Joe Kingma, Bill Knox,
Scott Lewis and Craig zippe.

Opening the second hali, Knox
displayed its only good shooting
streak of the game, cutting the
lead The contest Stayed nipsand~
tuck until the Siwasher's top
player, Dave Woodward, louled
out. Grinnell then held the lead and
Pioneer starters got back into the
act as clutch shooting by Fallon
and Roger Warner in the last so
seconds iced the game. The win
broke a six»game losing streak.

For the seventh time in nine
games, liaigh was Grinnell's top
scorer. The bench accounted for 32
tallies, 23 by the backcourt of
Delaney and Zippe.

The Pioneers' overall record has
been somewhat disappointing and
it seems, as Mitchell admits, that
they may have trouble matching
last year’s 8-14 mark, The team's
disappointing showing so iar,
paired with the good periormances
oi the reserves against Knox, has
caused the battle for the five
starting berths to resemble
“musical chairs " Delaney and
zippe are challenging the Warner
Brothers in the backcourt, Tile
three forward positions are up for

grabs between Fallon, Haigh,
Kingma, Knox, Lewis and Gunnar
Thors. Mitchell said not even
Haigh was assured oi starting
every game,

in contrast to the Varsity, the JV
has been doing quite well. After
losing to William Penn, the team
blasted Central College and 0t-
tumwa Heights College, both at
Grinnell before break.

Central scored 34 points, usually
enough to win, but Grinnell poured
in a whopping total oi ms. Zippe
had 34 points and Kingma scored
29. Also in double figures were
Drew Bergman, Rob Eyre and
Chuck Platter, Platter hauled
down 10 rebounds and zippe, who is
only 5’9”, grabbed nine.

Against Ottumwa, it was the
defense that sparkled, although the
offense was not bad either Holding
the weak Ottumwa team to just 16
points in the first half, the Pioneers
won easily, 92-35. The key iactors
were Grinnell's rebounding
superiority and the abundance of
Ottumwa turnovers.

areas, and that in tour or five years
the number of women at Grinnell
with basketball experience may
have increased enough to allow the
women to be competitive. in the
meantime, Hoth suggested
gymnastics as a logical sport to
replace basketball because its
season is the same as the
basketball season and it is a Sport

remains competitive regardless“

Athletic Director John Pfitsch
expressed a somewhat diiierent
viewpoint on the future of ﬁe

thinks that the program shoul e
continued. perhaps not on an in-
tercollegiate level. however, as
long as a substantial number oi
women desire to play basketball,
He suggested that in the next few
years basketball may best be
conducted as a physical education
class.

Since Hoth will be leaving
Grinnell at the end of this
semester, the future oi the
Women’s basketball team §tl
depend partially on the
qualifications and interests of the
new coach. Pfitsch added th e
Physical Education Depart rat
and the Physical Educa n
Committee had not decided
anything regarding wonfen's
basketball beyond this year, and
that any comments on what all
become oi the basketball program
are mere speculation at this time.

It is a fact, however, that for the
second straight year the women
have been unable to complete their
season and there is no guarantee
that they will be able to Compete on
an equal basis with other teams
