Latin American i-louse
seeks Chilean support

by Maxine Lowy

September ll marks one year
since Salvador Allende was killed
and a repressive military regime
has ruled in Chile. Perhaps the
most tragic aspect of Allende’s fall
was that the world had looked to
Chile as a model of social change
through peaceiul democratic
processes

Salvador Allende was Elected in
1970 by a majority vote on a
plattorm of agrarian reiorm, in-
come redistribution within a
transition to socialism. Allende
was a firm beliver in constitutional
l a w a n d
freedom of the
press.

Among his
actions in

States corporations owned so per

Herman ﬁnished balancing the

Craig Hobbes will administer a
newly appropriated $1,000

was plagued by lack of money.

cent. In this and other measures
Allende had unanimous support oi
the Chilean Congress.

Allende‘s opposition hoped to
undermine his reiorms by gaining
seats in the Congressional elecr
tions of 1972. However, this move
failed as Allende won more seats in
Congress. At this point, the op»
position policy changed irom
political Containment to outright
economic sabotage in which the
U.S. government and corporations
were directly involved. u.S.
pressures included a reiusal at
credit and oi parts that were
needed in Chile’s American-made
machinery, International funding
organizations headed by U.S. of-
iicials put the iinal stronghold on
Chile‘s economy.

Although Chile and its struggle‘
may appear distant to students
here, it actually touches us very
closely. As already mentioned,

adept iinancial maneuver. In the
past. SGA had allotted $3 per
student to each hall. This year, in
order to directly subsidize certain
all-campus events such as the
James Gang Band and the Loose
Hall Ball, hall funds were given
only $2 per student. With the extra
money, SGA is able to add $1 per
student to each hall,

$200 is being turned over to a
special iund for tuning pianos and
another $200 is helping KDlC meet
a pressing deficit carried over
from last year.

KDIC’s Record Service is un-

providing an opportunity for
students and townspeople to order
any record or tape in print at

Forum desk every Saturday at-
ternoon between 1:00 pm. and
4:00 pm. and are then iorivardcd

All remaining proiits go to the

which are on display in the posts
niiice and dining rooms, vary with
the list price oi the particular
album or tape, and average bet-
ween two and three dollars under
the list price. Special rates are
provided for “Hot Box” albums,
the recently released albums
which are selected by station
manager Frank Stoler and
ieatured regularly on the KDIC
music program.

According to a recent New York
Times article, eight million dollars
appropriated to the CIA by a
committee headed by Henry
Kissinger ior the purpose of
“unstablizing” Chile, helped
iinance the overthrow. Today
military and economic aid to Chile
continues to aid General
Pinochet‘s repressive military
regime.

In an effort to remind us about
what happened a year ago in Chile
and what still is going on, the Third
World Study Group staged various
activities for the Grinnell coma
munity this week, Silent theater,
petitions to Kissinger, a KDlC
broadcast oi Chilean protest
music, and an informal discussion
at Latin American House were
used to focus attention the day
which marked one year since the
tall oi democratic government in
Chile. The Third World Study
Group hopes to foster greater
interest and concern for oppressed
people throughout the world.
