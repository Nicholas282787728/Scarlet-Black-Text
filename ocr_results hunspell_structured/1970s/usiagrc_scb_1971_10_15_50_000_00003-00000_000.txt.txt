$800 SGA Money To Bring Russian PM Here

by Don Dagenais

Last Monday evening the
Joint Board approved up to
$800 of StudentGeneral Budget
and Reserve funds to bring
Russian poct Andre Vozneseir
sky to campus November 13*
14.

Assistant Professor of His*
tory Gregory Guroff, who ape
peared before the Board to
request the emergency fund-
ing, neted that his case is an
example of the complications
in budgeting which resultfrom
having the various budgets
administered by different bur
reaucracics. Guroff’s plea
was prefaced by Greg Vrani-
car, who has been complaining
about this very problem in the
88:8.

Guroff called Voznesensky
“Russia's leading poet,” and
commented that Grinnell was
exceedingly lucky to get him
for two days, immediately fol-
lowing Voznesensky's trip to
Ames in early November.
Voznesensky is a champion of
individuality in Russian socir
ety, and was a student ofBoris
Pasternak.

”it is not often," Guroffsaid,
”that a college of our size can
attract a cultural figure of
Voznesensky's magnitude."

Guroff felt thatnotonlywould
Veznesenky give Grinnell stur
dents a rare opportunity to
converse with a leading Ruse
sian cultural figure, but that
the poet himself would be in-
terested in seeing an Ameri*
can small college -' "he pro-
bably won't believe that such
a thing exists."

After a minimum of dis-
cussion, the Board,noting that
the GB&R fund is approx}
mately $1900 above emer-
gency level, unanimously ap
proved up to $800 of student
money to bring Voznesensky
to campus. Guroff noted that
he will attempt to raise the
money elsewhere, but that the
SGA action at least guaran-
tees that he will be able to
offer the poet that much for

coming.
In other action, recommen*

Debating whether to approve $800 to bring Russian poet
Andre Voznesensky to Grinnell, Joint Board members listen
to Mr. Guroff’s elegant, cultural plea.

hall damages .were approved
by the Board. Now a student
who is responsible for hall
damages has the option of
signing a form making him
liable for the damages rather
than having to go through Ju-
dicial Council proceedings.
The Committee netes, hOW‘
ever, that a student can still
be brought before the Judi»
cial Council for other actions
not directly concerning hall
damages.

The presidents also dis-
cussed the matter of ISPIRG,
the Student'administered con-
sumer-action group which Is
beginning in lowa. Should the
majority of Grinnell students
sign a petition advocatingforr
mation of the group, a re-
fundable $3.00 per year tax
would be attached to the regur
lar semester fees of each
student.

Loren Hart protested the
idea, noting that it would take
some positive action on the
student’s part just to get his
money back if he did not wish
to support the organization.

College To Use
Recycled Paper

Two new Grinnell College
publications are being printed
on paper made from 100 per
cent reclaimed waste paper,
according to the Office of
College Relations.

The reclaimed paper used in
a new folder, “The Grinnell
College Visiting Lecturer
Program, 197172," is made
of recycled waste paper; the
ink has been retained. "The
Sharing of Grinnell: Admis-
sions Information, 1971772,"
will be printed on selected
bleached papers.

The college expects to
"save" 1 1/2 trees for each
100 lbs. of recycled paper it
uses.

Mario Bognanno admitted that
the device was probably just

a Dlov “to get more moneV"
since few students would pro-

bably contribute otherwise.

Social Coordinator Ed Levine
gave the Board his opinion on
the matter of havingtheSocial
Coordinator position made an
elective one. ”Frankly, Idon't
trust the students to elect a
person who knows enough
about the economics of music
to do a good job," he said.

Carolyn Ashbaugh of the Lie
brary Committee appeared
before the Board to enlist its
help in trying to cut down the
number of booksmissing from
library shelves. She empha»
sized thatmost students aren’t
thieves butmerely "don’twant
the hassle" of checking books
out. This muses great incon-
venience for students who need
the books in question.

Soybeans from Organic Form,

by Nancy Wilson

Have you ever wondered
where Saga soybeans come
from? They are organically
grown on the Van Sant's ﬁrm
of 175 rich acres 5-1/2 miles
west of Grinnell College.

If you're a person who likes
to see before he believes, take
advantage of the Van Sants’
hospitality. Mr. Van Sant will
be glad to point out to you the
abundant earth work castings
which signify that the soil is
rich in minerals. The earth-
worms decompose organic
material in the soil, such as
remains of harvested crops,
to produce the humus, themost
life supporting part ofthe soil.

Organic farming isa simpler
and more effecting method
than farming with chemical
additives. Rather than buying
chemical fertilizers, pesti-
cides, protein supplements for
cattle feed and DDTcattle oils
to keep ﬂies off the animal’s
backs, Ogganil‘ farming methe

ods compliment the balance of
nature. When the balance of
nature is maintained, farmers
such as the Van Sants findthat
it is unnecessary to introduce
artificial elements.

The Van Sants have lived on
their farm since1948. Up until
eight years ago Mr. Van Sant
farmed with chemical fertili-
zers, insecticides, etc.

Look at their rich green
fields and their clean crops,
free of weeds. Then compare
this to the dry, weedyfields of
neighboring farms. Weeds
build up soil. Ifthe soiiis rich,
few weeds grow.

The Van Sants are warm,
friendly people anxious to
meet Grinnell students.
