For the next ght weeks, the Gl'in-
nell Parks an, Recreation Depart
ment is olleri ' "course in
vegetarian cookery; under the instruc-
tion of new Boren'stein. The first
class met Tuesda , September 25, at
the Memorial Building on Broad
Street; but there‘is still time to join
the group

The aim of the course is to introduce
interesting and varied menus without
meat. Borenstein said. she noted that
meatless cooking is not limited to
preparing rice or noodle dishes Real
knowledge about food, and types of
food production, opens up a number of

choices. She stressed the need for
nutritionally balanced meals, stating
that this is the major battle the
vegetarian faces.

During the last seven years, Boren-
stein has been mastering the art of
meatless cooking. She is an ovalactate
vegetarian, meaning that she includes
dairy products in her diet but excludes
any fish, meat or animal fats.

Borenstein explained that by com-
bining various foods, you can create
menus that are nutritious and good
tasting without any overbearing ingree
clients like rice, pasta, or eggs. it must
also be pointed out that not one single
food source contains 100% usable pro-

Balloonists' hopes deﬂated

by Bob Klelne

A sign suddenly appearing in the
Post Office last Thursday morning
read' “Come and listen to a balloon!
(1- in front of the Science
Building).” It sounded like a great
theme for a study break, but what
were they doing in front of the Science
Building?

Actually, it was the Grinnell College
Amateur Radio Club sponsoring an
unusual display of radio communica-
tions. The club provided the ap-
pi'opriate equipment for Mark Hyde to
communicate with his father, Fred,
who was in a balloon over Kansas at
the time.

Hyde’s father, and three other peor
ple, were attempting to set records in
distance and endurance, while
simultaneously being the lirst
balloonists to successfully float over
the continental United States. Their
starting point was Tulmac, Oregon,
with a final destination of either NDI'r
iolk, Virgina, or Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina, depending upon flight condi-
tions.

Unfortunately, the balloonists did
not make any transmissions on the
afternoon the radios were displayed
outside the Science Building, “Earlier
that day, the balloon had been blown
on course," stated radio club presir
dent nod Sinks, “and since they were
busy making adjustments, they had no
time for radio communications."

On Saturday evening, Hyde was
finally able to contact his father.
They talked for only ten minutes,
since it was about eight degrees
Farenheit where the ham radio was
kept on the balloon

Early Tuesday morning, the balloon
was forced down in southeastern Ohio
by a storm Hyde remarked, “My
father phoned me and said that lie was
a bit ‘bruised up' because of the lan~
ding, but was otherwise unhurt.”

According to the unofficial results,
the balloonists set no new records
They were in the air for 135 hours.

which is four hours short of the pre
sent endurance record for a heliumr
tilled balloon.

Hyde brought a hot air balloon on
campus last year and gave ”test
rides” to those who were interested
He was pleased with the interest
shown at the ham radio demonstration

and hopes to bring another one on

Each week the class will focus on
cooking a meal that contains the
necessary levels or proteins and alsn
proves interesting to create and eat.
All ten students help prepare the meal
and later sit and enjoy the good
tasting tood they have made.

The class meets again Tuaday, Oct.
2, from 7:00 PM. to 9:30 PM. for an
evening of Tofu and other ways to
cook a meatless Chinese menu. Each
week the menu will be changed,
preparing those dishes that the
students wish to explore in the realm
of vegetarian Cuisine.

singing.

The radio club also offered to send a
message anywhere in the United
States for anyone who came to the
demonstration. This service was free
or charge and is just an example of
the public Service that ham radio can
offer.

Fast food finds home in Crinnell

by Hot Hil/mon

October iirst hailed the Grand Open
ing of Hardees, Grinnell's only iast
food outlet. Some of the questions that
have been raised are: “Why did
Hardees build in Grinnell, was it
because of the college?” and “How
many students will be working
there?” , ,

The reason for Hardees move to
Grinnell was a simple one, There was
demand for a restaurant of its type.
Chris Glassel, assistant manager of
Hardees, explained that the land had
been owned by a private party the
previous five years and that
McDonalds had recently made in-
quiries into the purchase of the land.
“If McDonalds is looking into a loca
tion, you know there has got to be de-
mand in town for that kind of ser-
vice," Glassel said.

Apparently there is demand for this
type of service, for during this past
week, the Hardees has been kept ex
tremely busy by throngs of customers.

Dick Vos, head of the financial aid .
program on campus, was approached
by Hardees to help iind 4D or 50
students to fill positions in their franv
chise. The entire application process
would be handled through Job Service
or iowa. Vos felt that interest in these
jobs would be good, since students
“would much rather work two ten-
hour chunks at Hardees than bits and
pieces at Food Service,"

Vos placed a notice in the campus

memo stating that Hardees applica-
tions were available through him. [he
itially, students displayed little in-
terest, possibly due to the onrcampus
rumor that Hardees required a
minimum of a twenty hour work week,

He countered this with another
notice in the memo, affirming that
Hardees was indeed looking for
students only to work seven or eight
hours per week. This was the figure
that Job Service had given him, Once
application interviews had begun, it
was discovered that Hardees did have
a minimum work load of ten hours per
week, but this did not seem to slow the
demand for applications.

The actual number of Grinnell
students hired did not reach the
numbers of 40 to so given before. in
actuality, only 25 positions were filled
by college workers with the other 25
positions filled by local residents, Vos
felt that the students may have been
at a disadvantage due to their leaving
for October and winter breaks,

Not so, says Glassel, “Students have
already told me that they are planning
to work over October break and many
have also committed themselves to
work over December. I’ll be able to let
them know if they’ll be needed during
that time by the end of November,“

Oh, for those students who did not
get jobs, Glassel added a final note,
“We still have your applications and
you will be the first called whell film?
are any vacancies." 7
