difficulty persuading upperclassmen, en»
sconce in the single of their choice, to
move into the unknown. Furthermore some
repairs in the bathrooms were not com—
pleted when the semester began.

Students now living in the Park Street reSr
idences have mixed feelings about the situar
tion. Some like the convenience of classes,
but dislike the distance to the vending mar
chines and the laundry facilities. The quiet,
_ness of the buildings is mentioned as a
positive iactor, and some like the small
numbers of people there, while others feel
out oi] from the humanity of the college.
And then there are those who miss the
television set they left behind...

Similar to the residence houses are the
two topic houses, Russian House and Music
House. These buildings have been rather
extensively modified by the partitioning oi
rooms, the addition of electrical outlets,
and modiﬁcation of bathroom facilities.
Capacity of the buildings has thereby been
increased to about fifteen, but the process
costs four times as much as that required
for the residence houses on Park Street,
and furthermore the modifications make it
difficult to use the buildings for anything
but student housing. The newest example is
Russian House, which was redone last
summer. .

A much greater feeling of camaraderie
exists among the denizens ofthese buildings
than among the oft-campus residence hou-
ses or among dorm—dwellers, which is ex-
plained, of course, by their common inter
est. Residents View their circumstance as
markedly superior to that of their class»
mates in dorms. “No comparison” said
one. Some of the project house residents
indicate, however, that they might be better
off in co-ops.

Last semester the Budget Priorities Plans
hing Committee recommended gradually in-
creasing the student body to 1500 over the
next few years, thus easing Grinnell’s re-
current budgetary crisis. This presents a
housing problem which could be partially,
but only partially, relieved by the utilizar
tion oi collegerowned off-campus housing.
The four to five houses being added next
year will add perhaps 40 spaces. Ralph
Pomerenk, college Business Manager. esti—
mates that of the twentyrtwo college-owned
houses currently being used by iaculty meme
hers, possibly tive are usable for student-
housing purposes. The others, he said, are
just too far removed from the campus. in
basic form, these buildings could provide
another to spaces.

By going to the more elaborate “phase-
two” construction, the capacity of both of
these increments of 40, and that of the two
present residence houses, could be doubled.
In all, something like 1507175 spaces could
probably be provided eventually. However,
the extensive modifications would call for
a rather significant monetary investment,
and a definite decision to utilize the extra
space. If the work is limited to Boo per
sonnel, it would mostly be limited to the
summer months, a time when only 45 work-
ing days are available, if additional capaciv
ty were desired, it would probably have to
come from the town housing market.

Coops Seem
A Successful

Experiment

by Mike Stern

Food Coop, Housing Co-op, Farming Co-
op, Co-op store, Curop house; these are
quite different things, but they all have one
thing in common: the word “cooperative",
which says a lot about what they are. The
word “cooperative" implies a bringing to—
gether of needs, resources, and skills to
form a group in which the individuals work
together towards their common goals. This
can extend from the farming cDrop, in which
the individuals join together to improve the
success of their farms through groupaction,
to the kind of co-op house that exists at
Grinnell in which people group together in a
house seeking a better living atmosphere,

There are presently four cosop houses at
Grinnell ranging in size from nine to fifteen
people; 1137 Park St., Conoco House, con-
ierence House. and Pine Tree House. They
were started this year as an “experiment",
but judging trom the way the “experiment“
has been received it looks like it will go
beyond the experimental stage.

It took a good deal of student pressure and
activism to get this “experiment” started
in the first place. Up until this yearthe offr
campus houses were either project houses
such as German House, French House or
Conference House, oriust residence units,
mainly for senior Women. At the beginning
of last year the students began seriously
applying pressure for co-ops, but the admin-
istration was not too receptive.

The coaop houses are attractive to many
people because they combine the advantages
of both onrcal'npus and offrcampus living.
The student still lives in campus housing
and so does not have to hunt up an apart
merit, but he does all cooking, cleaning, etc.
The only college services that the houses
receive are BM; services such as garbage
pickup and maintenance Although off-
campus living does not have the advantage
of the large dorm population, it isn’t quite
the same as living in an apartment with say
one or two other people,

Probably the major reason that peoplewent
into the co-ops this year was to escape from
the dorms and from SAGA'S cooking. All of
the cosops do their own cooking, and no one
in the (loops is on board plan, Each person
usually ends up having to cook about once
every week to ten days, The cleaning is car
ried on in different ways in the different
houses, ranging lrom daily clean-up by two
people to group clean-up once a week.

Another advantage of living in a corop is
that it is cheaper, The off-campus resident
does not have the burden SAGA costs and the
toad is purchased in large enough bulk so
that it is quite cheap. Although it is cheaper
in the long run, some of the people in the
co-oDs have told me that they have figured
up the costs and the prices that they pay to
the college, and they claim that the school
comes out making money. The college says
not.

One of the major disadvantages that people
note about living in a {10GC is the isolation
that they feel train the campus. The co-ops
are all off»campus houses and thus they are
quite isolated from the social life of the
dorms, Pine Tree House is the closest to
the dorms being across the street from
South Campus on East Street. Conoco House
is the furthest away on Sixth and Park
Streets, which makes it very isloated from
the whole campus.

Probably the major hassles that have
arisen in the co-ops have been interpersonal
conﬂicts among the members of the group.
The nature of living in ahouse with ten other
people, eating, cooking, and just generally
spending a good deal of time with them obs
viously leads to at least one of these probe
lems. There is no retreat to the anonimity
of the dorm to escape these situations. This
is one ofthe reasons that students organizing
a comp have to try as hard as possible to
get together a group oi people that are like
ly to get along well.

Although the co-ops have their practical
advantages of better food and housing, many
of the people in the so-ops see them in a
broader sense, viewing this type of living
situation as a means towards building amore
tightly knit community among themselves.
Through this arrangement they hope to es—
tablish a communal living system in which
the group works together and helps each
other. Some residents see the co-op as a
type of preliminary commune, and some
members of the coop thought they might go
onto live in a commune, Some members
also saw the co-op as a potentially political
environment. because it challenges the nor
mal types of living units and interaction
among people Many also seettie co-op as
helpful in reiniorcing and aiding “revolur
tionary” ideas since a group of close
friends of simllar pursuzision is available
for group discussslons,

As of now the corop situation for next year
is still uncertain. There may be as many as
13-15 off-campus collegeeowned houses
next year, but it is not known how many
of these will be co-op houses TheAdminis—
tration does not want to make the investment
in the renovation of single family houses into
student houses and then have to renovate
them back in a few years it the student pop-
ulation goes back down.

Nonetheless, a great deal oi interest in
co-ops for next year seems to exist. A row
more co-ops may be formed next year, but
there could be twice as many applications
as spaces available. Some groups are also
iorming proiect house cerops, a womens‘
co»op is being formed, and interest nasalso
been expressed in a photography co-op and
a vegelarlan co»op.
