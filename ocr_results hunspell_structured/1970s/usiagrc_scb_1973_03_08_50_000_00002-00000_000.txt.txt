by Roxane Brown
For those of you who thought that

died out on Grinneli’s campus, well

for you. An inspirational spirit has
been born at Grinnell, and it bears
the title of the Grinnell Young, Git-
ted, and Black Gospel Choir. The
newly formed choir is under the dir»
action of Milton Rolland and the
guidance of Professor Cecil Lytle,
The choir which originated with just
a handful of black students congre-
gating on Sundays last semester in
Younkers' lounge has grown to a
membership of about forty black
students with instrumental accom-

paniment.

The choir has been organized for
six weeks, and it has already been
engaged in two off-campus perform~
noses in addition to its iii—Weekly
Wednesday appearances in Cecil
Lytle’s Black Music class.

The first engagement was alGrace-
land College in Lamoni, lowa in
honor of Graceland’s Black Week
The second commitment took them
to Simpson College in lndianoia,
Iowa on Sunday, March 4, 1973.
Grinnell‘vaoung, Gifted, and Black
Gospel Choir performed during Si-
mpson’s Black Week in a program
along with a black gospel choir from
the University of Northern Iowa in
Cedar Falls and a Church of God

culty members that the voting be by
a written ballot, President Leggett
declared that to be the procedure.

Political Science Professor Edwin
Gilmour, however, obiected on the
grounds that he was opposed to any
sort of secret proceedings. After
some discussion over the parlia-
mentary and substantive issues in-
volved, Gilmour's objection was
turned down by a Vote of 19-38-1.
When the final vote was taken
Gilmour rerused to take place inthe
procedure on the same grounds, but
asked that his vote be recorded
as “No." The final tally included
ten absentee votes. The total of 89
votes (out of 105 faculty eligible
to vote) was far greater than the
vote totals for most faculty decis»
ions.

Leggett Remarks

In his introductory remarks Pre-
sident Leggett addressed himself
primarily to the issue of mistrust
between groups at the college, ob-
serving that references to political
power and accompanying internal
struggles are "irrelevant and frus-
trating.”

“The crucial problems of this
college” cannot require that "all
I400 of us are in absolute and ir-
revocable agreement," he said, and
observed that the administration will
act as it sees ill on a Continuing
basis, "The failure to deliver and
to deny our responsibility is to
put the institution into reverse, or
at best into neutral,” he said.

In other business, the faculty ap
proved a motion that the Associate
Librarian be an ex officio member

Prisoners,labor Organ

by Terry Woli

Panel discussions featuring labor organizers and
representatives from penal reform and legal defense
groups concluded the People‘s Alternative state or
the Union Symposium Friday and Saturday. The sym—
posium was sponsored by the Peace Collective,

Attendance at these presentations dropped sharply
from the levels Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
last week when Grinnell professors lectured in South
Lounge. Kenneth Christiansen spoke on the environe
mental crisis, Richard Kagan on the South Vietnamese
political prisoners, and Joseph Wall on the constitutional
crisis.

At Friday night’s session on penal reiorm and legal
justice, Richard Tanner, a member of the Church of
the New Song and himself a former prisoner, told a
group of about 20 that ”prisoners who think are ex-
tremely put upon." Another iormer prisoner and mem-
ber 01 Church of the New Song, Bob Copeland, echoed
this view, saying that active prisoners experience
”extreme sensory deprivation” in what are called
"strip cells". Prisoners are left naked in these cells
in which there are bare concrete floors, no light, and
toilets and ventilation controlled by guards.

An even more obnoxious program in the prisons,
according to Copeland, is “behavior modification",
which Copeland insists is a euphemization for“psychic
genocide”. Behavior modification is a program for
prisoners with particularly offensive or Violent behavior
and, not coincidentally, the most politically active
'prisoners lall into this category.

Copeland and Tanner are part of a group that pub-
lishes the Prisoners' International Digest, and Copeland
said the object is to teach the prisoners that “the op
pression in prison is related to the oppression that
brought them there in the first place."

Education of the public is also needed and, in fact,
Copeland said “what prisoners need most is to have
the public be aware.”

"The people sustain the prison system, the people
pay for the prison system, and the people can stop
it,” Copeland said.

Legal Aid, a direct way to help those oppressed
by the legal system, is also in difficult straits, ace

The Gospel Choir

ilers Discuss Reforms

cording to Linda Fox of the Hawkeye Legal Aid Soc-
iety, Ms, Fox Said that because bright young Legal Aid
attorneys initiated lawsuits against government or-
ticlals, President Nixon is “zeroing in On Legal Aid ”
Some Legal Services programs havealreadybeendrop-
ped, others are on 30 day funding rind an Administra—
tion bill in the works would further restrict the scope
of Legal Services.

The American Friends Service Committee also has
a group which is concerned with the quality or Justice
in lowa. Bob Diamond and Doug Washington explained
that they were working to see that a 1967 Iowa bail
law and a recent Supreme Court decision on fines
were more closely iollowed.

i‘wo ol the three major events scheduled for Saturday
did not take place, when representatives irom the
American Indian Movement and welfare organizations
failed to arrive for the conference.

A session on labor and the farm was held Saturday
afternoon in the South Lounge. About 25 students lis-
tened to and talked with a University of Northern lowa
math teacher who is also a labor organizer connected
with the AFL-CIO, two members of the Migrant Action
Program, and the State Chairman oitheLettuee Boycott
Campaign.

The labor organizer, Julie Wiesenfeld, articulated what
was basically a socialist program of “production
lor use”, while the MAP people stressed the presence
in Iowa or much greater numbers of migrant workers
than most people realize.

Lando Valadez, State Chairman of the Lettuce Boycott
Campaign, talked mostly about the lettuce boycott which
that organization is currently sponsoring.

Valadez said that ASLP and Safeway stores were prin»
cipal targets oi lettuce boycott pickets and urged Grin-
nell students to join in this effort either in Des Moines
or elsewhere, since there are no All? or Safeway
stores here,

In assessing the conference, one of the organizers,
Barry Zigas, told the 55:8, “We’re sorry that more
students didn’t take advantage of this opportunity to
meet people from outside the college community who
are actively engaged in political action in Iowa.”
