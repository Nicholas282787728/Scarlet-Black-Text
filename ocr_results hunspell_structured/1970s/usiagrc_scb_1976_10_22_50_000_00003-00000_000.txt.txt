\dancel'. with one question looming
a my mind, “How the hell does one
get interested in belly dancing?”
PreViouSly. I had knotvn that
Desiree was irom Turkey and I
thought lllat'mlghl be the clue. As
it turns out, she iirst danced tour
years ago when she “as at a
Turkish ski resort with her tamily.
One night she had
been out drinking in a “low class,
decadent Turkish hangout” with a
couple of guys. AS sometimes
,Jiappens, no one could cough up the
,..l at closing time When. as
custom commands, thc Turkish
clientele began ioikstnging and
dancing at the bar. Desiree saw a
"\‘ayoul oi their tinaneial dilemma.
One tumped oit her chair and
began belly dancing tor the all-
tnale Crowd Turkish custom
dictates that it the pertorinanee is
enjoyed, one takes some paper
money. lickstt and places it on the
periormers iorehcad. Within ti
short time the out had been paid
and the owner was eager tor
Desiree to dance the next. night.
The next morning. Desiree and
her mother uere on the ski resorts
ibairliit when suddenly a guy
creamed out. “Hey, there‘s the
girl who i‘vas beilydancing last
fright.” Her mother looked around
Md saw no one but her fourteenr

 

yearold daughter. Desiree ex-
pected her mother to be angry. She
calmly responded however by
asking her daughter if she would
like to take some lessons to im~
prove her obvious talent.
