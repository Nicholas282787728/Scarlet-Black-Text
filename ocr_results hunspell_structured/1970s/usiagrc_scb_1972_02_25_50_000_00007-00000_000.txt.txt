conilicts relating to his philosophl»
cal beliefs, which had since been
resolved.

Reierring to this, the department’s
recommendation stated, “the recon
ciliatioli either must make the doc»
trine of lower class revolution ridie
culous or the lecturing to Grinnell
students foolish,"

This apparently alludes to a doc-
trine that Nasser, as a sellepro-
claimed Marxist, should espouse,
The department report concluded
that a firm belief in lower class
revolution would be foolish at a
middle-class college However,
Nasser denies any such belief at
this time and disputes the Iustness
oi the department‘s conclusion.

Kerry Middleton, chairman of the
Philosophy EPC, feels thatthe Phil;
osophy Department believes that
“you can’t be a good teacher and a
good Marxist at the same time.”

Predictability?

The recommendation to terminate
Nasser's contract was based on the
{act that because Nasser’s previous
periormances were not consistently
good the department could not "pre—
dict" that they would be in the future.

Kerry Middleton, who voted In favor
of retaining Nasser, pointed outthat
“you couldn't help but makepredice
tions, but the way you choose your
data determined the outcome,”

The department recommendation
warned, "any prediction based on his
(Nasser's) work done prior to re-
ceiving a new contract may well be
proven ialse once the contract is
received."

However, Nasser interpreted the
prediction as an “unfalsifiable
Slur.”

“The department concluded that
since all Marxists are Machiavel»
lians and all Machiavellians will try
anything to get what they want, that
Nasser could not be trusted once
his contract was renewed,” Nasser
said.

“Empirical evidence becomes ir-
relevant,” Nasser continued, “What
the department is saying is that my
issuing the same-grades wasaisy

boiic way of raising the middle tin-

ger.”

Nasser believes that the evidence
in the recommendation Was tinted to
support ioregone biases. In his
response to the recommendation,
Nasser clarified, "and, make no
mistake, the rationale is political."

Shooting Gallery

”There were forces in the Execu-
tive Council of previous years that
wanted me fired," Nasser asserted.
He alluded to criminal charges by
various faculty members which
instigated a call to the State Univer-
sity of New York, at Binghamton,
where Nasser last taught.

Intolerable Tension

According to Nasser, one member»

ident Should contact the 54:8

next week at the latest. We will
run a story on the candidates
Friday, March 3, which-is the
last day ior iiling ior the post.

Jaw

voted ior reinstatement, more than
hali against and several abstained.

He interpreted the rationale ior
those who voted against the renewal
as “you can't iorce a man on a de»
partment that doesn’t want him ”
Clottelter agreed that such an action
would produce an almostintolerable
tension within the department,

The recommendation oi none
renewal did include many oi
Nasser’s contributions Nasser pare
ticipated in a “Symposium oi Mod-
ern Imperialism” a lecture and dis
cussion on “The Films oi Ingmar
Bergman,” a discussion on the “inn
terhational aspects” oi Nixon‘s new
economic policy, and coeurganized
the “Symposium on Modern China."

The EPC recommendation oi re-
newal stated that there was no quese
tion oi Nasser's background and
knowledge, that he wasacooperative
sponsor oi independent studies and
that his social studies seminars
were or high quality. They did how-
ever question his eiiectiveness and
periormancc in class, The minority
opinion stated that Grinnell is a
"teach or perish institution” and
that must be considered ioremost.

Worley said that it was the compila-
tion at all Nasser’s iniractions and
inconsistencies that iniluenced the
iinal decision to overrule the EPC,
Nasser commented that “the grading
issue was the main iorce behind my
contract not being renewed H

Option Undecided

Nasser has the option oiremaining
at Grinnell next year. Dean Walker
said that because oi a recent iaculty
regulation that states that all iaculty
must he iniormed oi dismissal at
least a year in advance, Nasser was

,awarded a terminal contract for

1972313.

Nasser has not decided whether he
will accept the contract. He has ap
plied ior positions atother colleges,
but admits that “jobs aren’t easy to
come by.”

“If there were some organized
political action, I would stay," he
stated. This would still allow him
another year to pursue anotheryob
if his contract were still not res
newed,

Replying to whether it would be
possible to reverse the recommen-
dation, Wurley said that "this would
not be a favorable time to' recon-
sider ” He mentioned that Nasser
has not attended a department
meeting since the recommendation
in November and that there is some
question or his improvement in the
classroom this year.

Kerry Middleton said that the chan—
ces are not good because Nasser
is still ”deemed unreliable by most
oi the department.”

The feelings oithe department were
summarized in the Conclusion oithe
recommendation for non—renewal:

“Mr. Nasser is a pleasant, bright,
persuasive persomahd has the pun
tentlal to be a (the teacher, good
lecturer, a teacher who causes Stu-
dents to do first-rate work, a good
scholar, and a contributor to other
College needs. But he has lost the
respect of the department as a lec—
turer, administrator,'and scholar,”

Nasser views the negative recome
mendation as a danger to general
college procedures.

“Any minority member of a C167
partment can be dismissed on shabby
grounds, regardless oi the recom~
menuallons by the student EPC," he
said, ”the students get cheated into

thinking that the college is a market
place of diversified ideas.”

Worley admitted that there were
numerous rumors circling campus
concerning Nasser, but that when-
ever they reached him, he tried to
“shoot them down.”

“People did want to get rid oi
Nasser first year, but that was poli—
tics and had no place,” Worley said.
He then referred to the glowing re-
commendation the department gave
Nasser iirst year.

Kerry Middleton doesn’t believe
that there was any political discrimv
ination within the department. Greg
Butcher, another EPC member, said
that “any prejudice was of a per»
sonal, not a political nature "

however, Nasser indicated thatthe
Executive Council “rejected the let»
ter on the grounds that it was politi-
cally biased and didn't support the
recommendations." However Beryl
Clotlelter, a member of the Execue
tive Council and Chairman of the
Faculty, said that “some members
were not entirely satisfied and asked
for some further information,” He
denied political undertones.

Greg expressed the differences in
beliefs of Nasser and the rest oithe
department. He explained that “the
other members of the department
tend to regard philosophy with more
reverence than'Mr. Nasseri”

“I don’t believe in thegrading sys-
tem, the existing teacherestudent
relationship, and philosophy as the
queen olsciences,” Nasser enumer—
ated.

He noted that the department “is
worried about post 5th-century
views on philosophy.”

Power To The People

At a meeting on March I, 1971,the
three members of the department
expressed some of the reasons for
their displeasure with Nasser. Ac
cording to Nasser, these included his
article in ”High and Mighty" which
ended with the phrase “power to the
people", the disappearance oi the
department as a familial unit since
his arrival, and his public criticism
oi the academic philosophical estab—
lishment.

However, Nasser mentioned that it
was curious,,that none of these
qualms wer‘é‘dater presented to the
Executive Council and that the
grievances that were written to the
Council were not introduced at this
meeting.

Worley said that he finds it diffi-
cult to believe that Nasser wasn’t
aware of the bases for the depart-
ment’s dissatisfaction with his per—
iormance, He cited a previous “low
salary raise” as a concrete reilec-
tion at this displeasure,

"By the end of the first semester
oi his second year, his Job was Serir
ously in question," Worley noted.
The unfavorable recommendation
by the department was tantamount to
firing him.

Clotfelter said that it was “Concet-
vable but most unusual” for the
Executive Council to overrule a de-
partment's recommendation. “It
is too hard to emass evidence cone
trary to it," commented Greg Butch-
er.

Yarmolinsky Lectures

Adam Yarmolinsky, Harvard Law Professor who will lecture here this
weekend, has had a distinguished and controversial career in public service.
While his activities have produced innovative legislation and useiul scholarly
research (he is known as the midwiie oi Johnson's poverty program and
was one oi Robert McNamara‘s special assistants), Yarmolinsky has been at
times the victim of political expediency in government.

Aiter receiving his law degree irom Yale in 1948, liarmolinsky directed
several studies ior private ionndations and government agencies. A sampling
oi his involvement is worthy oi note as it gives one an indication as to the
wide range oi his involvement. For example, in 1955, he directed a study oi
iederal security programs tor the Washington oiiioe oi the Fund tor the
Republic. in a very different area, Yarmolinsky released in 1960 a report
indicating that IQ tests are inherently discriminatory against children irom
disadvantaged minorities. More recently, Yarmolinsky has completed a study
on the impact oi the American military establishment on American society,
His contributions in major periodicals cover a variety oi topics ranging
over such varied subjects as the poverty program, the arms race, civil
disorders, black power, and urban renewal.

Mr. Yarmolinsky is currently directing the Weliare island development
in New York City where an autoelree residential area ior 20,000 people
is to be created. This development is to provide housing not only ior elements
oi all income groups but also ior the aged. The project is an attempt at
eliminating the problems and discomiorts oi the traditional urban environ»
ment and creating a selfecontained community that is aesthetically attractive
and iunctional,

logical Seminary, and as the Associate Director oi the Division oi Higher

Emphasize ‘Sicholuslic’ News

 

Results of a recent content analysis
study of small college newspapers
were recently received by The Scar»
Iet and Black.

The study, by two Luther College
students, revealed that the 5313 car-
ries more news in the “scholastic"
category than any of the other six»
teen Iowa newspapers studied. This
iinding probably rcilects a great
amount of activity in that area here
last semester and a corresponding
emphasis on it in the newspaper.

In most contentareas, however, the
Site ranked close to the average.
According to the study, 33% of our
copy is “campus news", 2% “state
and local” and “15%” national news;
the average breakdownwas 83—3-15.

Approximately one-fourth oi the
SliE is “devoted to editorials rather
than straight reporting”; in this
category, the average was 19% and
the range was irom 40% (cue) to
2% (Buena Vista).

Actually, the 3&3 does not have
enough editors to produce that many
editorials _. the Luther students
must have counted all of our editor-
ial (page 4) and op-ed-pagc (page 5)
columnists in this total.

One interesting parameter mean
sured was “percentage oi copy de-

voted to iuture rather than past

events; here the son was given
31%, slightly above the average oi
30%. (Joe was at the bottom of this
category (12%), and Buena Vista at
the top (60%) ,

Taken in conjunction with the other
comparisons, this might indicate
that “copy devoted to future events"
is largely announcements oithe kind
which are carried in the Campus
Memo at Grinnell,

None of the other statistics were
too earth-shattering. The She runs
above average, at 32% advertising
according to the study ._ but not
according to our business manager.

There is 29% less humor in the
5513 than in the average lowa college
newspaper; this may mean thatGrin-
nell students are more serious than
others or it maymeanthatthe Luther
students didn't get the point oiour
quotations oi the week.

The 5&3 ranks slightly lower than
the average in many other news
areas: literature, and miscellan-
eous. Editors Steve Grow and Mark
Sableman said that they hoped to
make up the gap in literary fear
hires, but “too many of our repor—
ters' stories are miscellaneous as
It is.”
