 

KDI C clarifies editorial

To the Editor The purpose or this
letter is to clarity sortie or the
misunderstandings that have
resulted from the editorial calling
tor President Turner's resignation.
which has been aired recently on
KDIC.

The first point to be made is that
the editorial has been erroneously
referred to as L! ”Kch editorial."
KDIC. as a non-proﬁt. educational
radio station. cannot assume 'd
position on this or any issue The
purpose of airing editorials on
KDIC is to allow interested
spokespersons to voice their
opinions through this one par-
ticular medium. Therefore, the
opinions expressed in this or any
editorial are completely in-
dependent of the station owners.
managers, and operators.

Furthermore. there has been
some speculation as to the
existence of a conspiracy iormed
by campus organizations to
remove President Turner from
office. It should be made Clear that
no member or any campus group

because KDlC. as previously

Last weekend. between Fai'enls'
Day. OSA and True of America. I
had the time to go biking out in the
country south oi Grinnell. The
country is. contrary to the
stereotype. not ﬂat but rolling. and
there is a rhythm to it that makes
for good riding. Long stretches of
corn. hay and soybeans blanket the
fields. with old white houses and
gray weathered barns added
almost as an aiterthought, as If
someone had realized that it is
people who have to plow the iields
and harvest the crops. it is possible
to ride [or several miles without
seeing anyone; the only sounds
that one hears are the click and
tred of the bicycle. the wind across
the fields. the occasional bark of a
dog. There is a certain beauty to it
all that is unlike other parts of the
Country. There are no mountains.
no towering stands or Norway pine.

 

but this country is beautiful all the
same. It need not apologize for
itself.
