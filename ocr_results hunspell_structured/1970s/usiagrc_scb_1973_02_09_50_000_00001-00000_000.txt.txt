Protest Marine Corps
Recruiter On Campus

by John Wylie
A Marine Corps recruiter who was on campus Tuesday to interview
students in the Career Services office was greeted by two separate deme
onstrntions in which some literature was destroyed.
Captain Patrow of the US. Marine Corps office in Des Moines was
on campus for the entire day Tuesday to discuss possible careers as
Marine officers with Grinnell students.

In an open letter to the campus,
the Peace Collective had announced
its opposition to having military re-
cruiters on the campus. A number
of other students, however, came to
the recruiter’s defense, calling at
tempts to bar him from the came
pus an abridgemeut of the right
to freedom of speech.

On Tuesday, a number of Grinnell
students did visit with Captain Pate
row “Seriously”, and some signed
up for a Marine physical examina»
tion during their interviews.

However, one interview had dif-
ferent results. Len Kurz, a mem-
ber of the Peace Collective, had
signed up for the last interview
of the day. He arrived at the Care
eer Services office with sixteen
other students for what he described
as a confrontation.

“We made it clear that this was
not a personal matter between us
and the individual recruiter”, Kurz
told the 5&5, ”but was instead dir-
ected at the organization which he
was representing. We were asking
some pretty direct questions,

though, and in that sense it was
certainly a confrontation.”

Asia lectures

by u sun staff writer

The Foreign Student Board an~
nounced this week a series of lece
tures and discussions to take place
beginning next week concerning
Asia. The presentations, which fol-
low closely the History Department
lectures this past week, are part
of the Board’s continuing program
of attempting to increase student
awareness of foreign cultures and
provide information to the student
body concerning other countries.
Students have in recent years ten-
ded ti) lose interest in foreign soc-
ieties, members of the Board feel,
and the continuing program is part
of an effort to restore lost inter-
est.

Robert Grey, Assistant Professor
of Political Science, will give a
talk on Tuesday, February 13 at
8:00 p.m. in the South Lounge on
“The Emergency of Japan as an
Asian Power." On the Thursday {017
lowing his presentation, three stue
dents will participate in a panel
discussion about life in Japan. The
three, Amy Spitzer, Ann lgarashi,
and Sherilyn Lee. have all spent
time in Japan studying under an
ACM program. The discussion is
hoped to provide a background for
students who will plan to attend
the Rosenfield lectures next week-
end,

The two Rosenfield lectures will
he given on Saturday and Sunday,
February 17 and Ill, at 8:00 p.m.
in the Roberts Theatre. Professor
Donald keene, the Rosenfield speak-
er, will be addressing the subjects
of “.The Beginning of Modern Jap
anese Literature" and ”Japanese
Literature After the War."

On Tuesday the let, Richard Kan
gan, Assistant Professor ornistory,
will speak at 8:00 p.m. in the South
Lounge on the subject of Taiwan,
and the series will be concluded
the following Thursday with a pres-
entation by senior Scott Well con-
cerning the subject of national iden»
tity in a colonial setting, particu-
larly as pertains to the experience
of Hong Kong. Weil was in Hong
Kong last semester.

Marine Corps literature had been set
up in the lobby of the Forum. Ac-
cording to the Career Services of-
fice, this is standard procedure for
all recruiters and employment
interviewers.

Bob Frost, another member of the
Peace Collective, told the SdiB that
he was “just going into the Forum,
minding my own business” when
he was “affronted by a table full
of fascist garbage.”

Frost added that his activities had
not been planned, butwere caused by
his “outrage” at the material on
the table. He immediately made an
anti—Marine sign, which was placed
in front of the literature table, and
he later added a Viet Cong flag.

Frost Said that he was not res»
ponsible for the defacing and des-
truction of the Marine literature.
However, a number at students on
a “literature»tearing frenzy” des»
troyed not only the recruiter’s ma-
terial but also several of Frost’s
antieMarine signs.

Frost’s original plan, he said, had
been to get a number of people
to take one piece of each kind of
literature and then simply throw it
away. However, he said, the situav
tion got out of control and both the
Marine and anti-Marine literature
was destroyed.

He added that his action was taken
independently, although he was cer»

ISU Withdraws ISPIRG Funds

by Don Dngeiiois

The Iowa State chapter of the Iowa Student Public Interest Research
Group (ISPIRG) voted last week to suspend payment to the state lSPIRG
organization of ISPIRG contributions it has collected this semester. The
action seriously affects the finances of the state group, since ISUAISPIRG
supplies over half of the State’s funding.

Mary Jane Wynn, Grinnell senior who is presently the chairperson
of the state ISPIRG board, told the 5313 this week that the ISU-ISPIRG
decision was announced to the state board at an emergency meeting last
Saturday. The meeting had been called to discuss lSPlRG’S financial
problems resulting from a low rate of collection from student members

this semester.

“At that meeting, just before the
financial situation came up for dis-
cussion, ISU announced its unwil-
lingness to discuss a resolution
of the financial problems suspende
ing funds,” Ms, Wynn said. "In a
discussion with an ISU state board
member, it was learned that one
student out of the 20,000 member
student body had questioned the use
of the student fees.

“Basically,” said Ms. Wynn, the
problem is rooted in philosophical
differences between some ISU and
other state board members.”

Lower Pay

ISPIRG members from ISU tend
to believe that most of the ISPIRG
activities should come out of the
state office, Ms. Wynn said, where
others maintain that “most ofthe re—
search should be initiated and Care

College Fuel Supply Holding Up

Rumors that the College is again
having problems with its fuel sup
ply are “completely unfounded” aCA
cording to Physical Plant Director
Dale Hawn.

Hawn told the 5&8 today that the
mild weather so far this month has
allowed the Heating Plant to run on
gas for the entire month to date...
leaving February’s quota of fuel oil
untouched.

”We’re out of the woods for Feb
ruary completely, and 90% out for

March”, he concluded,

Hawn also said that the chances
of the College’s calendar being al-
tered because of lack of fuel are
“so small that I'd call theiri laugh'
able".

Very servere weather during the
month of March could cause some
tightness towards the end of March,
but the chances of weather severe
enough to pose a real threat are
extremely remote.

ried out by students within their par
ticular institutional and local en-
vironments."

In a letter announcing their decis-
ion, members of the Iowa State
lSPlRG board said in part, “After
reviewmg the effectiveness, pro»
gress and financial policy of the
state group, ISU—ISPIRG has decided
that students will be better served
by directing resources toward dev-
eloping lSU-lSPlRG."

John Deuben, head ofthelSU group,
noted that the decision was made
because too much money was spent
on salaries and not enough on re
search, The research, furthermore,
was felt to be of little value to
students.

The Ames group plans to continue
as a local research organization
concentrating on problems relating
to students at the University.

John Neubauer, executive director
of the state ISPIRG organization,
was quoted in an article in the
Iowa State Daily last Tuesday as
saying that the hoard decided he
should work for a month without
pay, and that other Staff members
would also take pay cuts because
of the Iowa State action. The total
monthly salary of the ISPIRG staff
has been over $3,900,

Walker Addresses Faculty 0n Independents

by Curt Garrett and Don Dagenais

Members of the faculty approved last Monday-

resolutions from the Executive Council and the
Faculty organization Committee concerning the
voting membership of the Associate Dean on the
Executive Council and several faculty committees,
and heard comments from Dean Waldo Walker
concerning his recent action regarding indepen-
dent projects.

The resolutions concerning the Associate Dean
were passed by unanimous voice vote. The pos~
ition of Associate Dean was created this year
under the Office of the Dean, and no
official provisions existed for including the per»
son who holds that position on various college
committees.

The action of the faculty now designates Associate
Dean James Hamilton as a voting member of the
Executive Council, the Committee on Academic
Standing, the Committee on Admissions and Stu»
dent Aid, and the Executive Council Sub-Come
mittee for Educational policies.

Dean Walker, in addressing the faculty cone
cernlng his recent action limiting facultlng tear
ching load for independent projects, observed that
the action was an “interim measure, simply an

approach to keep overloads in balance." The Ed-
ucational Policy Committees, he noted are pre-
sentely delving further into the problem.

“We haven’t yet faced the issues of the philoe
sophy behind independent projects and what they
should be," Walker said, “but we’re moving to-
ward alleviation of the problem.”

Walker is currently preparing a set or questions
concerning the basic philosophy of independent
projeclsr EPC'S at the division level will be asked
to address themselves to the questions.

Turning his attention to the open iorum in the
South Loung last week, Walker said that “it
should have been of considerable interest to face
ulty to hear student opinions on independent proe
jects, and for students to hear those of the fame
ulty.” He intends to hold open forums every two
weeks, he said, “as long as there is agroup of
students and faculty who wish to attend,”

Walker also referred to the memo issues last
Tuesday from the Dean’s office about an upcoming
study of academic pressure. The study, he said,
will be “as objective...as possible.”

“The time to treat the issue is before the tens
sion of mid-semester develops,” he said.

EPC To Consider
Independents

by Merry Wiesner

Next Monday afternoon the Exe-
cutive Council Sub-Committee on
Educational Policy will be consid-
ering a number of issues which are
of direct concern to the campus
community, These include the cred-
it increase limit in Art, Theatre
and Music--fr0m 48 to 60 credits-7
Professor Philip Kintner’s request
for better guidelines for Guided
Reading Projects and, most impor-
tantly, Dean Walker’s proposed
guidelines for independent Projects.

These guidelines are to serve as a
statement of the purpose and phil-
osophy of independent study, rather
than a clear delineation of admin-
istrative details.

There appears to be no major
change in College policy toward in-
dependents, but there is a clari-
fication of many aspects of thatpol-
icy Independents are to be super—
vised hy a faculty member who has
previously indicated to the admine
istration a‘particular expertise and
interest in a specific area. Students
would be required to select their
projects from a list of these ar-
eas provided by the faculty,

Students must present some “pro~
of of achievement" at the end of
their project, such as a paper, art-
ifact or musical cnmpnsitinn, and
must undertake their projects on ‘
campus or in regular communica-
tion with their onecampus supervis-
or. The Dean of the College will
be responsible for approving all
projects.
