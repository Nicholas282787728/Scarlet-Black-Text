 

It's not too late to register to vote, and we urge all
students to do so as soon as possible.

With mid-terms close at hand, paper assignments finally
due, and break drawing near, it’s easy to forget such a
seemingly remote detail as the national elections. But
November ’7 is only one month away, and deadlines for
registering, which vary from state to state, will soon be upon

us.
GRINNELL STUDENTS HAVE TWO options: they can

register to vote in Grinnell, or can request absentee ballots to
vote in their home states or districts. Many students feel
more comfortable about voting in Grinnell, since most of
their time is spent here. With all the political activity on
campus, one can easily become informed about the issues of
this state and this district, Candidates such as Senator Dick
ClarkI Representative Jim Leach, his Democratic challenger
Dick Myers. and Governor Robert Ray have made or will
make appearances on campus before the election.

To register here is a simple and quick process. There is no
residency requirement. However, one must register at least
ten days prior to the election (October 28l if one goes in
person to the city clerk‘s office. The deadline for postcard
registration is 25 days before the election, October 13—next
Friday. To change residency for voting purposes one simply
indicates on the card that he or she has formerly been
registered in another area. The person's name is then taken
off the list of registrants in that area, to ensure that he or she
does not vote twice. That's all there is to it.

TO VOTE IN YOUR HOME election can be a little more
complicated. First you must be registered, and second you
must request an absentee ballot. The deadlines for these two
requirements differ in each state, so we suggest you find out
soon what the requirements are. In many states (such as
Illinois] you can vote early and won’t_have to worry about
mailing in yourvote. This can he done over break.

Most people who neglect to vote do so out of laziness or
forgetfulness. It’s not hard to get too caught up in the daily
pressures of life at Grinnell College. To live in isolation in our
own little college world is dangerously easy. But it needn't
happen. We have the opportunity to become informed about
the issues and we have the opportunity to express our
prefegrylgjhgjugh voting. As we constantly remind
ourselves, we do live in the “real world," and this is one
instance in which we can actively participate in it.

Letters to the editor

. Representatives are outraged by SGA outcome

To the editor: The SGA meeting on
Wednesday, October 4, was a
ludicrous farce which I never
would have believed except for the
factthat I saw it with my own eyes.
It is a disgrace that a majority or
students at Grinnell could sign a
petition protesting the CSL alcohol
policy, only to have the SGA not
reach any agreement on any sort of

‘ policy.

The actions of the person who
called a quorum and the persons
who refused to vote when their
halls were called, thus causing the

entire proposal to be rendered
useless, were unthinking and

immature. People who think that
their personal opinions are more
important than the mandate 01 a
campus-representative SGA
should notbe in a democratic body.
John Buckwalter, off-campus non-
college-owned housing
repr entative.

To the editor: We would like to
comment on Wednesdays Joint
Board meeting where final action
had been planned on the CSL
alcohol policy by the Board. Un-
fortunately, there was no official
action taken on this policy because
of the actions of certain voting
members.

After over one and a half hours of
debate on proposed amendments to
the restrictive policy two amendr
ments were added, The question
lconcerning the entire amended

policy) was called and a roll call
vote was taken A quorum was
present, and the members decided
to end debate and vote on the issue
immediately.

Minutes later, on the roll call
vote on the policy itself, only 15
(one short of a quorum) cast votes.
There not being a quorum, the
meeting was dissolved. SGA, in
effect, did not act on the original
policy Sent to them by CSL for
consideration.

We are concerned with the tact
that Student government officially
had no voice in the matter.
Regardless of the outcome. it is
important that Students have a say
in determining such a policy.

Not only were several hall reps
absent when this particular vote
was taken, but one. Seth Powers
from Smith, refrained from voting
although he was present in the
room. If a hall rep supports a
policy, he should vote “yes". ll he
opposes it, he should vote “no"; if
he is undecided, he may abstain. If
Seth had Voted in some way,
thereby establishing a quorum,
some action would have been taken
by SGA on this policy that included
the views of his hall.

Furthermore, of is voting
hall reps, four never showed up or
sent alternates (Read, Langan,
Cowles and off-campusrcolleger
ownedl. By the time the important
roll call vote came up, three more
had left (Clark, Gates and
Rawsonl.

3&0, clean up your act!

To the director of the Physical
Plant and the Campus Com-
munity: I do firmly believe that
this time your organization
(Buildings and Grounds) has
ﬁnally gone too lar.

To gather all (or at least half) of
the garbage on North Campus tor a
centralized pickrup appears to be a
rational act. But to do this on
Saturday morning and leave it in
front of Smith Hall for the duration
of the weekend is an abomination.

To make matters worse (if that
is at all possible). you leave it lying
not in Containers, but in black
plastic bags, sitting on the loggia.
Not that black plastic is not

aesthetic, but it acts as an in
cubator for the growth of micro
organisms. It also leaves the
garbage extremely vulnerable to
attack by neighborhood dogs and
rodents.

Please do not misinterpret the
reason for this letteril am sure
that the college is convinced that
providing free meals for dogs,
rodents, and micro-organisms on
weekends is good public relations,
yet somehow I get the impression
that the local health authorities
might not be of like mind,

Frankly, the garbage around
here reeks. Andrew Corwin.

Thus, eight hall reps did not cast
votes on the last roll call; in effect,
eight halls were unrepresented on
this important alcohol issue. This
lrresponsibility prevented the
Joint Board from commenting on
the CSL policy,

If the student body really cares
about student input, especially on
important issues such as this, hall
members should scrutinize the
actions of their reps more closely

Artists are needed

To, the editor: l disagree WiU'i
Kristi Falkner's contention that
three “artists in residence” are a
greater “luxury" than an elec»
tronlc music course (5&3 letter to
the editor. Sept. 28L

Not only do the members of the
Mirecoul‘t Trio share in the
teaching duties of the department,
but they also give performances
which appeal to a much larger
portion of the campus community
than do those of electronic music

A luxury at a liberal arts college
is something which is outside of the
basic disciplines, desired by or
useful to few students, and ex-
pensive to maintain. Ms. Falkner's
argument seems to be based on the
premise that what she likes is more
valuable to the college at large
than what she doesn't. Clay n.
Jenkins.

Defends KDI C

To the editor: It's always puzzled
me that people iind KDIC top
heavy with jazz, as Ken Krim-
Stein's artlcle on music in Grinnell
implied. There are approximately
twice as many rock DJ’s as jazz
ones. In the supposedly “prime
time" slots, late night time, the
jazz-rock ratio is about even.
That's due to more jazz DJ's
having previous experience in
radlo. KDIC's music is a pretty
good indicator of what the college
listens to. We don't try and pattern
the sound of the Station.

But I’m so glad Krimstein
pointed out the almost mystical
union between pot and music. I
think that’s one of the few musical
preferences we all share. Tom
Rayfiel, Program Director, KDIC.

Don’t fool with Mother Nature

It 15 hard these days to buy
something without the word
“natural" written on the package.

Everything from candv bars to
shampoo to wool shirts is made
with “natural" ingredients, The
selling power of ”natural" is easily
discerned. Over the past several
years “natural foods" and “back
to nature" llfestyles have come
into popularity; by buying
“naturally“ made or ingredient-
filled goods we are somehow able
to capture the fulfillment that
comes from this lifestyle,

There are two problems with this
logic. The lirst is that not
everything natural is good. Sugar
may be “natural," but it quite
clearly wreaks havoc with our
systems. And loo, rellncd sugar |S
not actually “natural ” So much
for candy bars.

But there exists a second
problem, more significant than the
first. What has obviously occurred
here is a distortion of the word
natural. What is disturbing,
though, is the neglect shown to its
original meaning. It IS a versatile
word, taking nearly a column in
Webster’s. I wish to focus on the
word as it was used by the so-
called counter-culture some time
ago.

NATURAL FOODS are distinct
from Commercial foods in that they
contain no additives..The move’

 

was toward a simpler, more or-
dered lifestyle, unencumbered
by the excess of a conspicuous
consumption society, There was
also a sense of restoring balance.
Natural food usually means the
exclusion of beef and other forms
of meat: one reason for that is to
restructure our food economy.
Americans, it is well known,
consume large amounts of heel,
Yet it takes roughly 16 pounds oi
grain to produce one pound of
meat! In other words. a lot of food
is being wasted that could be
feeding people,

The balance to be restored, then,
is both social and existential
Social in that there is an injustice
perpetuated when good grain is
wasted; existential in that one
involves Oneself in this restruc-
turine, and also in the balance
restored to one's health.

THERE IS ANOTHER use of the
word “natural” this time
referring to nature or the sarcalled
move “back to nature.” This too
has become distorted and
commercialized, Not only has the
backpacking industry become big
busmess. but its garments have
become a sign of fashion, not
function. Mountaineering boots
and down vests are worn by those
who never venture beyond the city
street ironically, it is just as well;
the remaining wilderness areas in

North America are in danger from
overuse and abuse.

We are left with a culture very
far away from its origins. What
started as a movement away from
excess has led back to it, Com-
mercialism, especially the
American brand, is pervasive. The
remnants left behind are bathed in
rhetoric; one wonders if there is
any substance behind these now-
tired Cliches.

I THINK THERE is, and it rests
in the original meaning of natural,
before it became affixed to candy
bar wrappers or Levi‘s ad-
vertisements. Looking beyond the
commercialism and rhetoric, we
can see that our lives are indeed
too cluttered, and we are far from
the earth that nourishes us.

An alternative is to reverse the
process, Get rid of the Clutter, ﬂue
incessant and wasteful cons
sumerism that pervades our
culture and become more aware of
the land around us, Living the good
life is a real possibility, but it calls
lor us to give up a way of liie most
of us are used to, We cannot con
tinue to live and ignore the needs of
others.

All of this boils down to caring:
caring about ourselves, our neigh~
bors, our earth. The movement to a

 

more natural lifestyle is nothing
more or less than this.
