Speakers, workshops planned

Time donates large journalism grant

by Kathy Vuper

Grinnell has received a $12,000
grant from TIME incorporated for
a lecture and workshop series on
contemporary issues in jour-
nalism.

College President A. Richard
Turner explained that the grant
will finance a two~year series of
approximately iour lecture~
workshops yearly dealing with the
press “as one of the most powerful
forces affecting individuals and
institutions in modern society,”
William Deminoff, Grinnell
director of college relations and
former lecturer in com-
munications, will serve as the
series coordinator

IN AN interview, Dcminoff
described how 'the grant was
awarded He had been bothered by
a statement in the 77373 Grinnell
College catalog which read,
“Professional advice to students
interested in journalism is
available, and visits to the college
by journalists enable students to
discuss their plans with
professional men and women
distinguished in the field.”

Demlnoff felt such efforts in the
past had been rather “catch as
catch can” and submitted the
suggestion {or the program to
President Turner, Turner relayed
the idea to his presidential staff,
which approved it. Mr, Charles B.
Bear, a Grinnell trustee who is
Group Vice‘ President of TlME

 

Incorporated was contacted. He in
turn took the request to TlME's
Contributions Committee, which
approved the 312,000 journalism
grant,

DEMINOFF is verv excited
about the series. He has
already selected communications-
oriented students to serve on a
committee for the series
Along with Deminoff and these
students will be some facility and
possibly student-atrlarge
members. This committee will
choose speakers as well as lecture
data. Goal date for the initial
lecture is right beiore or right after
midrsemester break.

The committee will also explore
format for the communications
series. One proposal is for a major
public lecture followed by an alls
day workshop in which students
would get writing experience by
the case study approach of present
issues, There will be no limiting of
students attending the lectures, but
the committee may have to enforce
a cutoff point (or workshops.

SUGGESTED speakers include
Ben Bradlee, editorein-cnlei of
The Washington Post, Ms,
Charlotte Curtis, associate editor
of The New York Times, and Mr,
Fred Friendly irom the Columbia
school of Journalism, specializing
in the electronic media Besides
national journalists, the committee
\Vlll invite local press personnel to
work along with the guests

Curtis and Friendly because these

journalism to Grinnell, perhaps

Turner and Deminoff Said no.
Deminoff went on to cxplain, “It’s
a return of concern about jourr

or society, applying a liberal arts
approach to how the journalist

Amoco urges de—regulation

by Jim Strickler

When Standard Oil of Indiana
(Amoco) sponsors a conference on
energy for college newspaper
reporters, it must be pretty
confident of its ability to sell
its side of the energy situation
Story, since college students are
not known for being receptive to
the views of big business.

The 30 to 4D reporters
from college newspapers in the
Midwest who came to Chicago for a
conference on energy August 11»12
were no exception. The reporters
heard Standard Oil economists and
executives, reporters irom the
Chicago Tribune and government
oiiicials speak on the supply at
energy in the United States.

Standard Oil was obviously
aware oi the group’s skeptical
attitude toward the oil industry.
They made it clear from the
beginning that they would not try
to brainwash anyone. They stated
their position simply, and at
tempted to back it up with a stream
of facts and figures.

Standard Oil's view is that ample
amounts of fossil fuels toil, coal
and natural gas) exist to mcel our
desires. ii energy prices are
allowed to find their natural level
through the laws of supply and
demand. companies such as
Standard oil will be happy to
supply that energy to the con-
sumer. Any energy shortages we
may currently taco are the result
of the government price ceilings
that keep energy prices artificially
low.

Of the many statistics discussed,
some oi the more important ones

 

quoted by Standard oil were:

——Thc United States imports 4,
per cent of its oil.

eon accounts for 45 per cent oi
the energy used in the United
States.

iDomestic supply of oil is
predicted to increase from around
8 million barrels per day to 11 mbd
by 1935.

‘Currently producing wells are
expected to be producing only 212
mbd by 1935.

~T0 meet predictions for 1985,
8": mbd will have to be coming
from new reserves, the North Slope
oil fields and enhanced oil
recovery iEORi.

Enhanced oil recovery is a
process being developed by oil
companies to force more oil out of
the rock it is trapped in (oil is not in
big pools as Jed Clampet found it
on the Beverly Hillbillies),
Currently there are two parts oi
recovery. These are primary
recovery and secondary recovery,
Primary removes about 15 per cent
of the Oil in a field, Secondary
removes about 25 per cent.
Enhanced oil recovery is a tertiary
process that attempts to remove
some of the remaining on per cent.

According to Standard Oil. the
amount of oil recovery irom EOR
is very dependent on the price per
barrel oil. If the price is $5. the
maximum producing ratc would be
0.3 million barrels per day. if the
price goes to $15, just over the
current World price for oil, the
maximum producing rate would be
1.5 mbd, ii the price would go to
$25. the maximum producing rate
would be 3.5 mbd. Currently, the

 

United States uses about 17 mbd.

All of the speakers tried to ex»
plain the complexities of the
energy situation, For example, one
speaker explained that not all oil
sells for the same price. The
government has set up a four-
tiered system of pricing, with
prices ranging irom $5.50 for oil
from old oil wells, to 314,00 for
“new" oil,

Careful distinctions were drawn
between “reserves” and
“resources.” Reserves are
recoverable \Vlth reasonable
certainity using extsting methods,
Resources are Concentrations of
materials that may be recovered in
the future, though not necessarily
right now.

Standard Oil agrees with much
of what President Carter has been
telling the public on energy-
energy use is growing rapidly in
the United States, the United
States has abundant supplies of
Coal, fossil fuels Will be very im»
portant in the near future until we
develop a renewable source of
energy such as nuclear or solar:
energy policy is tied up closely
with politics.

Ho\\ever, Standard Oil does not
agree “ith the basic thrust of the
Carter cncrgy policy. Standard oil
sees the basic problem as lack of
production This problem is the
result of insufficient monetary
incentives to energy companies to
produce more energy Standard oil
secs the Carter plan aimed at
discouraging energy Coln'
sumption. Energy Research and
Development Administration
