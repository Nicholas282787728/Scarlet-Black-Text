1. “Obscene material” is any material depicting or describing the genitals, sex acts, masturbation,

excretory functions or sado-masochistic abuse which the average person, taking the material as a

whole and applying contemporary community standards with respect to what is suitable material

for minors, would ﬁnd appeals to the prurient interest and is patently offensive; and the material,

taken as a whole, hicks serious literary, scientific, political or artistic value.

Obscenity controversy develops

by Anne Deluinol‘i

At a Grinnelerewburg School Board
meetinglate in November 011974, Grinnell
resident Ben See filed a formal complaint
against three books in the Grinnell-
Newburg school libraries. See presented a
petition signed by seventy/seven residents
of the school district who objected to the
presence of “The Godfather”, “The
Exorcist”, and “The Summer of ‘42’ ” on
the school library shelves. See ﬁled the
complaint on the grounds that the three
books ”descirbe, explain, or (allude) to
sexual intercourse of or between
humans,”

In agreement with a school board policy
adopted in 1973, the three books were
removed from school library shelves. The
policy states that books against which
iormal complaints are made are to be
removed from the shelves until the school
board reaches a decision regarding the
books.

The school hoard subsequently set up a
recondisderation board. The purpose or
the reconsideration board is to review
hooks against which complaints are tiled

and make recommendations to the school
hoard, The reconsideration board is
composed oi ten Grinnell residents, in
cluding Chairperson Harriet Adclhcrg.

Following the creation of the recon-
sideration hoard, the school board
received two new sets of hook complaints.
Ben See added “One Flew Over the
Cuckoo‘s Nest" and “Flowers tor
Algernon" to his original list of com-
plaints.

In a counterprotest, Jeanne pindcr and Jim Decker tiled complaints
against four encyclopedias, two dictionaries, and the textbook “Sexual
Reproduction,” According to Finder and Decker; these seven reference
works complied with the standards for removal outlined in the initial
protest. The nine newly cited books were removed iroin school library
shelvs.

The nexi‘ action in the book issue occurred as a result oithe organizational
meeting or the reconsideration board on January 9 oi this year, At a school
hoard meeting later during the same week the reconsideration board
suggested that the school hoard change its policy to enable the hooks in
question to remain on school library shelves. By a 4-1 margin the school
board passed a motion to alter the policy to provide that ”challenged
materials shall remain availahle ior use, pending a recommendation of the
reconsideration board and a decision by the school board." In accordance
with new policy, the twelve challenged works were put hack on school
lihrary shelves.

On January 21 the reconsideration board
hold its iirst open meeting, During the two-
and-arhalirhour meeting the board
members discussed “The Godfather.” Ben
See was present at the meeting and spoke
to the board. The board did not come to a
decision.

A! the request of Ben See, Fowcshiek
County Attorney Don Schild has written to
Iowa Attorney General Richard Turner
asking Turner's opinion on a number of
questions Most oi the questions have to do
with whether or not a person who is not a
student or staff member may look at
School books in a school building, check out
school books and remove them from the
library or school building, or
examine the records of hooks kept by the
schools. One question asks what course or
action the school district and the county
attorney should take if a certain book in a
school library meets the definition of
“obscenity" under Iowa law.

See was quoted in the February 3 issue of
the Grinnell HeraldrRegiSter as saying, “I
asked that the committee (reconsideration
board) be dismissed because. . .tbese
people don't have the right to say what's
obscene and what’s not, other than what
the law states. And they cannot come back
and say anything other than the fact that
the books are obscene, because the books
fall into this classification” Members of
the reconsideration board claim that their
responsibility involves the question of the
appropriateness of the hooks in the school
libraries rather than the question of
whether or not the books are “obscene."

The next meeting of the reconsideration
board is scheduled for February ll. The
meeting may be postponed until word is
received from the Attorney General.

Excerpts from an ”obscene” book

The following passages were taken
from Flowers for Algernon; by Daniel
Keyes: Bantam Books, 1970 The book
is currently being used in English
classes at Grinnell High School and one
of the books presented to the school

board’s reconsideration panel. In his
interview, Ben See stated that he found
offensive excerpts in the book between
the pages of 115-149. The passage
printed below are found in this section
of the book with the page number

following The passages are taken out of
context, which the Iowa obscenity law
says must be considered, but are
printed here to show the subject nature
of the objections raised.

“It’ll be different tonight. I swear it." Before she could
protest, I had her in my arms, kissing her, caressing her,
overwhelming her with all the built-up excitement that
was ready to tear me apart. I tried to unhook her bras-
slére, but I pulled too hard and the hook tore out.

“For God’s sake, Charlie, my bra—"

“Don’t worry about your bra . . ." I choked, helping
her to take it off. “I’ll buy you a new one I'm going to
make up for the other times. I’m going to make love to

of them were self-portraits, including two nudes. The

I pulled her down beside me on the couch, on top of

“Not here on the couch, Charlie,” she said, struggling
to her feet. “Let‘s go to bed.“

“Here," I insisted, pulling the blouse away from her.
