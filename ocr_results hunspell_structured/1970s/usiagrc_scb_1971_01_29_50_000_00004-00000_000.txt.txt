Perhaps part of the reason is playing basketball as they

sters, the Pioneers, lost two
more games last weekend to
run their overall record to
1.3 and their conference re-
cord to a not much better 1-4.
The Pioneers lost at Ripon
Friday night 83-64, and on
their way home, stopped offat
Lawrence Saturday night to
lose again 7262.

High scoring honors for the
Ripon game were divided bee
tween Robert Burnett and
Gregory Bombinski, who tale
lied 16 markers each. Saloun
and Trickey eased in 15 each
for Ripon. In this game, as in
the past, the Pioneers were
close in the firsthalfttindeed,
the halfttime score found
Grinnell and Ripon deadlocked
at 35-allrrand faded in the
second half. However, this is
the first time the Hippie Hoop-
sters faded so much.

because this was alsotlie first
game of Grinnell's season to
include a second-half near
brawl as part of the enter-
tainment. At the end of the
contact part of this non—con-
tact sport, Joe Kraut was
excused from the court for
his extracurricularactivities,
and without his punch (sorry,
spark) Grinnell was unable to
come back in the small am»
ount of time left. When the
nets had settled, the Redmen
had swiped the Pioneers
48729 in the second half to
walk off with an83—64 victory.
Against Lawrence, the story
was just the opposite. The
Pioneers, perhaps down from
their beating the night before,
failed to get into the game in
the first half and trailed by
ten points at halftime. The
second half found Grinnell

Wrestling Team 0-3,

Coach Sees "Great Attitude”

The San Sport’s Page has

previously refrained from
mentioning any results on the
Wrestling Team. The reason
is that there is nothing worth
mentioning, only facts which
make the prep football team
look good in comparison. So,
in answer to many inquiries,
“Yes Virginia, there is an
active wrestling team.”

The facts are that the team
is 0-3 in a dual meet compe-
tition, scoring a total of 3
points in all the meets. This
means they have either for
felted, got decisioned, or look-
ed at the lights. They have lost
to the tough teams of Loras,
Dubuque and Knox. The Knox
score was 43-0, with Knox
mllying 3 forfeits, i decision,
and 5 pins. The one man who
denied Knox 5 points was Don
Aldrich (heavyweight) in a
11-!) match.

There are some reasons,not
excuses, for this poor show-

ing. The team definitely lacks

experience in college compe-

tition; there is only one upper- »

classman, sophomore Wash-
ington Alston, on the roster.
Moe Hunt says of team cap-
tain Alston, "He has an out-
side chance at conference,
especially if he doesn’t
smile."

Wrestling is no sport for
pansies; the team is involved
in a rigorous training prog~
ram. Having returned from
vacation later than the other
sports’ teams, they have a lot
to catch up on. “But there is
a great attitude," says the
friendly coach, "andwe should
improve if desire counts."
The next meet is Saturday,
against Monmouth, on the mats
in Darby Gym. Your encourr
agement will be welcomed.

matched Lawrence point for
point throughout the half. Una
fortunately, they were unable
to gain any ground, and they
lost by 10, 72-62. Again, Bur-
nett led the Pioneers with 18
big ones, followed by Quint
Phca with 13. Lawrence’s
Warden led all scorers as

Once again, an analysis of
the statistics shows that foul
trouble was instrumental in
Grinnell’s failures. Against
Ripon, Grinnell gave away 31
points while getting only 20
themselves at the free throw
line. Against lawrence, the
situation was worse; the
Pioneers nailed three more
buckets, but they gave the
game away at the free stripe,
being outscored 2478. Thus,
both games were lost to fouls.
Next weekend, Grinnell tra-
vels to Beloit and to Coe of
Cedar Rapids. If the Pioneers
can steer clear of the refer-
ees and play basketball for a
full game, they might pull one
out. “Ra speaks

Grinnell Relays

When the chlorine cleared
and the tabulations were in,
the anxious crowd at the pool
found the Grinnell Aquajocks
in undisputed possession of
second place. Following a
battle of Conference Titans,
the final score at the Grin-
nell Relays last Saturday was
Augustana 69, Grinnell to,
Cornell 20, and Wayne State
17. Yet the stark, chalkr
written totals of asst. coach
John Worley hid the philosor
phical truth behind the meet.

Coach Obe’s boys turned in
respectable if not exceptional
times. Hulk Dale basked in
the brilliance of a blistering
2:20 for his time in the 200
butterfly. Yet neither this nor
the show of power by J. Rollie
The Beak, and Gibby Ward
("Short for Gabriel?" came
the query from the Augie side
of the pool.) in the 400 yd
relay and the 100 yd relay
could change the tide at
"Tempo" Pooli
Sidelight: from out of the

chaos of last Saturday’s meet
came the word we‘ve allWaIk
ed for. J. Rollie has indeed
been approved by the Grinnell
Chamber of Commerce (and
Mrs. Kaufman) to go ahead on
his business venture of opens
ing the first of a chain of
ROLLIE’S BIALYS PARLORS.

As a result of the efforts of
the diving duo of Burton‘ Pone
toon, Coach Obe has decided
to admit them to the team for
the price of one GrinnelISwim
Team T-shirt. At this writing,
rumor has it that Big Dan
Meyer is “firing up." If this
be true, then right-on Mr.
Meyer, right-on.

As though these fun facts
were not enough, the Grinnell
faculty and student body is
invited to the "Second Annual
lay A LoadOn Lawrence Day"
activities at 1:30 here tomor-
row. Experimentation is the
word for this forth- coming
meet, according to Coach Obe.

THE MOANER

Will Grinnell Be HurtL By FFG?

by J.C. Labowitz

The college community is
agog with the latest in the long
list of critical issues to face
Grinnell College. This issue
trancends the monetary cri-
sis, the intellectual crisis,
the moral crisis, and the late-
paper syndrome. This is the
Manual Dexterity Situation
(or MDS). No, Manual Dexe
terity is not to be confused
with the great leftfielder for
the Oklahoma City 89’s of the
same name, but refers rather
to the deplorable state of the
average Grinnell student’s
hand-and-eye coordination. I
mean, in an age that demands
increased use of fingers,
hands and wrists in every-
thing from (on the advice of
my attorney, I refuse to state
exactly where there are in
creased uses f, h, and w),
Grinnell is sadly lacking in
development of this aspect of
life in the modern world. It is
time that we burst forth from
our ivory tower and stopped

were) and did something! Th-
ree million dollars for new
phys. ed. complex andathletic
fields is not enough! We are
in grave danger of experienc~
ing a flipper finger gap (or
FPO). If we are to maintain
our position of leadershipam»
ong the nation's educational
institutions, we have to offer
our students the total educar
,tional experience, and how
can anyone expect to become
a Renaissance Man or Woman
here when we lack an essen-
tial element of human devel‘
opment'.7 Therefore I pro-
claim, What this college needs
is a good S¢pinballmachineill
I can think of no greater way
to 1) develop Vour collective
finger muscles and coordina
tion, which is always useful,
2) raise incredible amounts of
money and 3) waste ungodly
amounts of time, than by in-
stalling a bank of pinball mar

ing skillfully manipulated by
eight or ten flashing, ringing
Grinnell students, pinball win
zards all. The esthetics of
pinballs would be worthy of
4 credits in somedepartment.
And there is no sound in the
universe thatquite symbolizes
victory and accomplishment,
or that is'quite as satisfying,
as the loud clunk when a free
game is registered in the little
window.

In keeping with Lhis column’s
policy of not only speaking out
but acting, I dispatched my
roomate, CraigMiller (Grand
Island, Nebr., bats and throws
with difficulty) to query our
student coordinator Greg
Vranicar (of indeterminate
origin) about the possibilityof
obtaining pinball ma chines. He
expressed first disbelief, then
enthusiasm about the whole
thing, and investigation into
the matter is proceeding. The
next step is the Senate, and
this column will keep you, the
future pinball magicians, in‘
formed.
