CANDY HAGGINS-

by Patricia Mayo

On first meeting one might easily miss
take resident adviser Ms. Edna (Candy)
Haggins for a Grinnell student. However
when she begins to expound on her inter-
ests and her future, it is evident that she
has much more thantheGrinnellexperience
behind her. Ms. Haggins has received her
B.A. degree in American/English Litera~
ture and her MA. degree in Educational
Psychology.

As an adviser and instructor, Ms. Haggins
was attracted to Grinnell because, “Grinv
hell is a small college which makes for
closer interpersonal Contact in dealingwith
students. i prefer this Setting over the
general, impersonal professional contact oi
counselor and client which was my exper-
ience in counseling as a grad student at
Southern Illinois University"

As a black woman Ms. Haggins is partic—
ularly interested ln working with and en-
hancing the close community of the black
students on Grinnell's campus, “One of my
deciding factors in my decision to come to
Grinnell was the closely knit andconcerned
attitude of the black students that i met
when l. was being interviewed for the posie

tion as resident adviser, ”It is important
lor Black students to search themselves
psychologically and “get themselves togetr
her” hrst as individuals in order to make
tor a better people collectively,” she stated
emphatically

Hoping to combine both her protessionand
lamily life, Ms. Haggins leels that there
need be no separation between her career
and her duties as wile and/or mother She
leels that one can do a good yoh oi both it
it is one’s intention to do so.

CAROLYN
REID-WALLACE-

by Sybille Scott

Having set up an appointment tor the in-
terview of the year, t was somewhat (lis-
appointed when I was unable to keep it due
to a very uncontrollable circumstance (div
arrhea). I requested a rearrangement ot
time for the interview later that same day
and was regrettably informed that the ears
liest available time Slot was on May 1.
It must have been my lucky day because
my dentist told me the same thing. My ego
now deflated, l have set out totellthevworld
what I think of Mrs. Carolyn Reid Wallace.

AS an instructor, there are few better,
She is interesting, informative, and, sur-
prisingly enough, witty. She is quite der
manding oi her students andalways suspects ,
a student can do better work than what he
does, A brilliant woman, she is well aware
of the importance ot the “discovery" type
education. Being the dynamic teacher that
she is, her students react to her in either
of two polar feelings. They either hate her
or they love her!

Shy and introverted, the petite Ms. Wall-
ace sometimes wears the facade or girl-
ish naivite, and yet people immediately
sense (upon meeting her) her womanly grasp
on the world A mother of oneson, Addison,
Jr., she seems to be most comfortable in
her home, Ms. Wallace likes to entertain,
and in this more relaxed setting, talks pie»
asantly about her life and her work. Out
from behind her Office desk in Carnegie
200, she becomes a “real" person-mm
whom most. people would like to meet at
least once in their lifetime.

An instructor even outside the classroom.
she has always made herself available in
order to help others. She is a widely re-
ceived lecturer, across the country and a
renowned educator. She is otten questioned
regarding her opinions of the academic
life here at Grinnell compared to other
schools, and she merely grins whether
sardonicaliy or approvingly is unknown
at the mention of Grinnell as the "Harvard
of the Midwest." She does savthatsheknew .
of Mr. Liberman long before she hart ever
heard of Grinnell,

What else do I know about Ms. Wall-Are”
She drinks coffee. plays cards. and knows
a hell or a lot! There is only unethiitg
concerning this impressionable Cancer '0—
mnn that i am certain 0t, and that is. of
all the people who kllnvt‘ hel. tow St’ltimn
forget her. And lhilt's :I whale of .I (‘onir
plinient!
