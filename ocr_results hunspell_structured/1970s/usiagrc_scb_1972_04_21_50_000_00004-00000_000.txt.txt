Credit-Erase Falls

by non Digenais

A proposal in include creditsei'ase
options within the new gradeserase
grading plan was deieated last
Monday by the Grinnell iaculty by
a vote of 743-2 The motion,
made by Faculty Chairman Beryl
Clotfelter, was to be an amendment
to the grading plan passed by the
iaculty the previous week.

Said Greg Glii‘off, History: “You
cannot legitimately compute a GPA
anyway. Thus there is no reason
for a crediteerase,” Anne Walter,
SGA Vice-President, reported to the
iacuity the results ot an SGA op-
inion poll on the matter, which showe
ed that students would take advane
[age of such It credit-erase ops
tion should it be passed by the fa,
cully. Faculty members voted, howA
ever, to defeat the motion

The new grading system as it now
stands therefore designates that lac—
ulty members may grade a student
with an A, As, B, B~, ora c. Any
work which is not C quality will be
given no credit, and no entry will
be made on the transcript concern-
ing that course. The only require-
ments for graduation thereiore are
the completion of a designated num-
ber oi credits by the end oi each
semester.

Faculty members debated on se-
veral amendments to the Clotfelter
motion before eventually defeating
it. Debate centered around an
amendment proposed by Don Smith,
History, to remove the motions re.
striction on credit-erase options
for courses in the mayor field, Fae

Psychology, protesting the “direct

tion) to protect the student from his
own decisions," and approved the
Smith amendment 3449-9

At one point John Worley, Philo»
soplly, proposed a removal of the
motion's provision that only one
course a semester be taken on ere-
tilt-erase. This would have in ef-
fect allowed students to take all
four years entirely on the credits
erase basis Robert Voertman,
Economics, turned and remarked,
“John, you’re iolling us ofcoursel“

“Well, the thing has gotten so stus
pid by now," Worley replied, "that
I just thought I’d add to the confur
sion.” Worley’s amendment was
defeated ”#2749.

At the next iaculty meeting on May
1 Mr. Vuertman will present a mo-
tion or his own concerning the grad
ing system, which would allow stus
dents to select from a variety ufops

reports.

The faculty also elected John Dawe

Organization Committee ior the
coming year.

leg «I Rights
by John Morrissey

Provisions oi an lowa bill to grant
legal rights at age 19 will go into
eilect July 1. According to the bill,
rights and responsibilities presently
granted to Zl-yezir-olds will be exs
tended to lncludc persons in the
19~20~year-old bracket.

in the Original draft the age of
malority was set at [3. Legislative
passage of the bill, however, was
marred by an allsout rift between
legislators in the House iavoring an
lBsyearsold drinking age, and those
in the Senate who felt the drinking
age should be 19. The conflict sent
the bill into a conference committee.
which iinally settled on all rights
at age 19.

Obyection to legalized drinking at
is centered on its possible impact
on high schools. Advocates oi the
19-year-old drinking age pointed
out that over half of all high school
students turn 18 before or during
their last senior year, and would be
an easily available source ui alcos
hol fol" underage students A 19-
year-old drinking age would elimi-
nate most legal drinkers from the
high schools

Advocates or age ill, however, said
high school Students would drink
anyway, and by keeping it illegal,
the legislature would continue to

encourage secrecy instead ofbring-
ing drinking out in the open. in
addition, the measure as amended
would mean more drunk driving, by
making it necessary to drink in
out»ofs_thesway places accessible
only by car.

Much behindsthesscenes conflict
revolved around the political mans
euvering oi Governor Ray and Lt.
Gov. Roger Jepsen. According to
an unoiiicial news source, the bill
as introduced in the House was pros
mised passage in the Senate, with
the full backing oi Ray. But Jepsen,
who is President of the Senate, re—
portedly became convinced that he
could beneiit politically by support—
ing an amendment raising the drink—
ing age to 15) He apparently did not
pass up the opportunity, and threw
his efforts behind the lBsyeai‘sold
drinking age amendment. The recent
signing of the bill (by Ray) speciiye
ing a lgeyeareuld drinking age may
be rationalized as a political victory
for Lt Governor Jepsen, Why all
other rights had to be moved up to
19 as a compromise cannot be rea—
dily rationalized
At any rate, the problems caused by
fake ID cards and agercliallenglng at
liquor stores and establishments in
town will fade next year as Grinnell

A silent struggle to help educate

Grinnell, lowa. Approximately tw—
enty—rive students are involved in the
Teacher's Aid program helping re-
lieve some of the strain in the over—
crowded school system and discovs
cring ior themselves if they want to
go into teaching as a career. Some
have already decided that teaching
is the iicld in which they icel most
needed. For these and others, the
reeling oi service and experience is
their greatest reward
aoh White is one student who is
involved in the program He visits
Davis School once a week ioriour

grade language class. Bob works
with students both individually and as
a group. One particular boy has

Bob, takes tests with him and learns
how to divide syllables. At other
times, Bob works with live or six
kids and helps them write coinposir

STOP AT TWO

Growth In A Finite World

by Bill Knecht

“Population growth transcends all
other problems” ”Unless tamed,
it will one day wlpc us irom the
earth.”

These words come from Norman
Borlnug. Nobel Peace Prize winner
and developer oi important new
strains or wheat which could go iar
toward alleviating food shortages in
many parts of the world
And yet Mr, Borluud admits that
simply increasing our iood supplies
will not prevent the inevitable colli-
sion course with the environment
population growth represents.

The U, S Bureau of the Census
reports that the population of the
United states increased by 1,547,000
natural births in 1968, 1,655,000 in
1959 and 1,787,0001n 1970. Figures
ior 1971 are not yet compiled, but
they will certainly meet or exceed
those of the previous three years.
Add to these figures an approximate
additional 400,0007per50n annual ins
crease due to immigration and it
becomes clear that the population of
this country is regularly increasing,
probably at a geometric rate
What are the consequences ofune
limited population growth?

Faced with finite quantities of no-
tural resources, increased popula-
tions will find their resource bases
exhausting at a rapid rate. As acon-
sequence, existing resources will be
in greater demand, and the cost of
procuring them will go up. Procuree
ment costs come in the form of labor
In short, either lahui‘ will eventually
rise or standards oi living rnust de-
crease to compensate for the lack
of resources, Either way, the indi-
vidual can expect a harder life
The processes ui procuring natural
resources and oi manufacturing con-
sumer goods and food produces di-
rect physical effects on the environ—
ment. We can expect the destruction
or our countryside by erosion, polius
tioh and building as population
growth iorces more intensive cultir
vation of existing land and re
sources '

Add to these physical trends the
psychological trends toward anxiety
and dissatisfaction as a result of
crowding, and the picture is com-
plete. The overpopulared world will
be a iilthy, eroded, overcrowded
place where days are long and the
Standard of living low,

This is the Case for voluntary pop—
ulation stabilization, It need not be
mentioned that the population be
volunlarily stabilized. It will star
billze itself naturally, Wars, famine
and disease are the "natural” me-
thods oi maintaining a stable popu»
lation, However, most sane people
would likely prefer to avoid these

possibilities.

The Census Bureau acknowledges
that 2.1 children represents the
family size that would lead to an
eventuallysstahle population in this
country. This would take into account
the small number of persons (2%)
who do not marry in this country,
as well as a number who die on the
highways, in overseas wars olims
perialism, etc This would dictate
that the ideal size of the American
family Should include between 2 and
3 children.

It is easily understandable that the
Srchild family is not ideal. For
every ialnily with 3 children, 9 lame
illes must limit themselves to Z to
yield the stabilization number.
Clearly, a norm toward Srchild
iamilies would produce a disastrous
rate of growth

Considering that a number oi ia-
milles will exceed the ideal of 2
children by having multiple bi hS
or by carrying unwanted pregnancies
to term, the “,1" of the 2.1 I‘E*
placement iigure can doubtless be
easily met. This leaves the family
of 2 children as a norm not to be
wiliully exceeded by any responsible
parent

Adopting the 2-Chlld iamily will not
produce immediaie population sta-
bilization. Approximately 50% oi
people in the United States are under
25 years oi age, This means that,
right now the number of older peo-
ple is small compared to the number
of young people. As these young peo—
ple glow old, even it they only have
2.1 children per ialnily, the number
or old people will have grown, making
the total population larger, The Cens
sus Bureau Calculates that by the
year 2020 the population would ap-
proach 300 million, provided that the
ethic of the Zechild family were
adopted today. This means that there
would be almost 50% more people
here, even if we decided to start
being responsible right now.

Given the modern methods oivol-
unlary sterilization, artificial con-
ception prevention and abortion,
there is no longer any rational ex-
cuse for tin unplanned child being
born. Given the statistics of this
country’s population growth, we are
headed tor a population disaster.
Fortunately, this disaster is avoid-
able. Uniorlunaiely, ignorance,
superstition and stupidity have pre-
vented us irom coming to grips
with ourselves to date.

The argument ior population cons
trol and the Zroi'rleSSrchild family
is mathematical and precise The
consequences ior avoiding Complis
ance will be disastrous and painful.
Fears, desires and “morality" not-
withstanding, unless we stop at two,
“'0 will be screwed.
