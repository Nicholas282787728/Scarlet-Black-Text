Alum Cookbook

MORTON GROVE, IL- -A Grinn-
ell alumna and Class Agent is
preparing a new kind of publicas
(ion -- an alumni cookbook.

Mrs. Vincent Maselli (‘29) says
she got the ideaafterher success
with putting a short recipe at
the end of achofher classnews
letters.

She notes mat, “Theresponse to
these recipes has been so trem~
endous that i have Wonderediffhe
class preferred the recipes to
my letters!"

Maselli has a two~fold purpose
in proposing the new book. Inad-
dition to a desire to share good
recipes with the rest of the past
and present College Community,
she hopes the proceeds from the
book will help in “rejuvinating”
the college's physical plant (add-
ing paint, plaster, and repair
Work where needed).

Members ofthe present mmpus
community are’invited to submit
recipes for the new cookbook;
in fact, Maselli has indicated that
she hopes to be “floodedwilhree
cipes."

Recipes should be mailed dire-
ctly to Mrs. Vincent Maselli,
8909 McVicker Avenue, Morton
Grove, IL 60053 no later than
February 1, 1974.

IFl-Jei Crisis Hiis GrinneHV

by john Wylie

Grinnell’s fuel availability piss
ture, which had appeared bright
earlier in the year, has clouded
considerably with recent natural
gos service suspensions.
Physical Plant Director Dale
Haw“ said yesterday that North-
ern Natural Gas Company suse
pended service to the College
for a one week period from
November 1 to November 7.
He added thal this was the ears
liesi serVice suspension ever

KDIC‘FM, which has been off the air since yester-
day morning, will resume broadcasting at noon to a
marrow according to station officials.
Station Manager Dale Scherler says the shutdown was
necessary to allow installation of new equipment in the

station‘s studios.

Scherler said the equipment will improve KDIC's hr»
oadcast quality, and added that the smtion will cele-
bratc the “grand reopening" with a record giveaway

next week. Everyone is invited to stop

new facilities.

A "Help Impeach Nixon" bake sale was held in Main Lounge

for the College, which receives
natural gas on an ‘interruptable
basis;

Although gas was being used
yesterday, Hawn noted that
the gas interruption had
forced the College to burn 15,000
gallons of its 118,000 gallon res
serve of fuel oil.

Hawn said the key to the Coir
lege's ability to operate normal-
ly is the availability of natural
gas — a ﬁactor on which infor-
mation is lacking.

FACTS, FIGURES

Grinnell's heating season lasts
approximately 150 days, Hawn
explains, and if fuel oil is used,
the heating Plant burns an aver-
age of 3.5 to 4 thousand gallons
per day.

Under the present fuel alloca-
tion structure, the College is

slated to receive 156 thousand
gallons of oil in addition to that
already in the storage tanksiThis
provides for 65 to 75 days ofheat.
Hawn says that if the College
on get 70% of the natural gas
it had last year, it will be able
to operate adequately.

ment: Pa e 6

He urged members of the cams
pus community not to become
alarmed about the situation. Al-
though malor decisions cannot
be made until the natural p5
picture is clearer, temperature
reduction measures initiatedlast
year will be continued.

President Glenn Leggett yesa
terday issued a statement to the
campus community urging coop-
eration during the fuel shortage.

Governance Panel Formed

by John ”Rimbull

The issue of student participa-
tion in college governance is not
dead yet. Last weeklohn Hansen.
Donna Lynn Rethenburg, and Aus-
tin Kessier were appointed by
SGA to get together campus op-
inions as to what a student’s role
in college governance should be.
However, Hansen points out that
this time, “There's going tobe
a new approach."

This new approach is one in
which “SGA politicos" will not
be the domineering force behind
any of the inquiries. Instead, this
is to be a general search for
student, faculty and administra»
tion ideas on the proposition of
community governance. The [hr
ee SGA appointees will mainly
serve as a steering committee
for a group of students interes-
ted in pursuing this idea.

As such, the group's'purpose
Will be mainly to gather infor-
malioni The job ofworkingup spa
ecific proposals will come later
on. As Hansen remarked, “We're
sincerely looking for all campus
opinions. I really don‘t think
anybody knows what anyone else
is thinking about at the moment.
Rothenburg pointed out, "Up 'til
now all questions of community
government have come up in the
text of a power conﬂict; that's
not the way to go about it."

John Hansen expects to clear
up the haze by getting together
a group of students who will in-

terview key members of the
faculty and anyone else interested
in the question ofcampus govern‘
ance. Austin Kessler will be 35*
sisting in this effort.

Donna Lynn Rothenburg will
have a similar group that will
look at student participation in
the governance of Other colleges.
The emphasis willibe upon in-
dividuzl smdenr evaluations as
gleaned from transfer students
and personal acquaintances at
other mmpuses.

The point of tilts operation is
to get new opinions from diffs
erent people than those involved
in the proceedings up until now.

Serious work on the matter will
not begin until early next sems
ester when people will probably
have more time to devote to the
project.

All intcrested students also are
asked to get in touch with the
committee members.
