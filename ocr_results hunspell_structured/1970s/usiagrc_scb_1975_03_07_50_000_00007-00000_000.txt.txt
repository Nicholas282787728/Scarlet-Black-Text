No, Gene Kelly and Ruby Keclcr
won’t be able to make it to (he
Grinneii Dance Troupe concert
But the allrstar Grinnell Volunteer
Tap Brigade will'prescnt their
debut performance lonight at 8
pm. in Roberts Theater.

The VTB. sponsored by mentor
Babe Voertman; lecturer in
theater. is the college's first tap
dance group. Comprised oI Nancy
Duhlberg. Nancy Fernandez, Pam
Gl‘eenblait, John Hamby, Julie
Layer, Todd London, Brian Mann,
Wendy Morton, Jim Perry, Susan
Spitzer and Laura Whitener, the
VTB has been working on a
number called a Waltz Clog. The
Waltz Clog, which is an old-
fashioned term for at tap dance,
came from an old book of 1930’s tap
routined, “This is not
sophisticated,” Voertman said,
“it's surt_ot_a jag routine." .

“I had no intention of starting a
tap-dance class this semester,"
said Voertman, ”until a couple
students ran in an asked me tor tap
lessons." Voertman told the in-
terested students to find a few
more potential class members, and
overnight the class was born. They
now meet twice a week for an hour.

“1 am not really a tap dancer,”
Voertman explained, “but i have
found this great fun to do." She

says the class is extremely enr
thusiastic and they practicc all the
lime. tPerhaps you have seen
them in the dining halls, llorm
lounges, lorum, ctc,l

Voortlnan was afraid the class
could be a bore to teach, but since
everyone is so iaithiul about
coming to lessons and memorizing
stops, the class has been a total
success. Susie Spitzer, whom
Voertman calls a “live wire” of the
group, agrees. “To be completely
honest,” she says. ”it has been the
most fun thing I’ve done here.”

The rest 0! the dance conert will
leature twelve dancers in eleven
contemporary dances. The student
choreographers are Tana Acton,
Randy Best, Deb Buchanan, Linda
Greenberg, Devon Griffith. and
Diane Roslon Voertman also
choreographed two numbers.

The two Voertman dance pieces
will ieature accompaniments by
Grinnell musicians. One jazzs
percussion piece, composed by
John Caniield, will be palyed by
Canfield, Dan Hexter, Scott Mason
and Dave Wopat, A contemporary
musical piece by William Duck-
worth, arranged by Steve Mitchell.

thesizer. guitar, piano and voices.

For an organization to remain
stable and efficient, it should have
membership formalities, elected
officers and an invariable con-
stitution, right? The Third World
Group says wrong.

That organization is informal.
About 25 people are involved but no
one is sure exactly how many. it
requires no speciiic philosophy,
knowledge, or skill to join, just
energy. The weekly meetings, at
which attendance is optional, are
scheduled whenever it is Con-
venient, The leader of each
meeting changes every week, and
projects can be determined by a
spur-of»the»moment consensus.

Some members admit that the
lack of structure may make it hard
to get things done. One said he
thought the group had been
”heating around the bush” and
that it was time to “get going”.
However, most are not very
Concerned about it. They believe
the group itseli is more important
than what the group accomplishes.

one member said, “I came into
the group not. particularly giving a
liip . . . i don‘t particularly care
whether we do anything or not.
Just so that we are working
together, I don’t care what any
decisions are, I put my preterences
to the will at the group.”

Lewin Weyl said the most imr

, portant aspectof the group was the

exchange of criticism between
members. Such critiesim is
common. The iirst part ot most
meetings is evaluation of recent
projects and the last part is

aroundiherroom judgment or the
gathering itseli.

A] Jessen, who insists he has no

higher rank than anyone else even-

though the campus director lists
him as Third World Group Coors
dinaior, said, “You always have
diiierent personalities and some
people dominate more than others,
and that's one thing we try to
overcome . , You should learn to
listen to other people and not to
interrupt."

The group decided to deal on
three levels: short-term projects,
long-term projects and study Most
of the short-term activities are not
yet fixed, although several such
projects will probably be iilms.

The group is locusing on one
longrterm project. “We would like
to strike up some more relations

with the farm community,” dcssen .

Said. “Coming [mm the food
conference, it was evident that we
need some more communication,”
he added. The group might ex-
change visits with some farmers,

The members agree that study
should be part at the group’s
program Jessen said, “We do feel
the need to study. You can’t
separate study and action very
much.” However, the type and
amount of study has not been
established. The program will
probably be volunteer presen-
tations on any topic.

The organization started the
year as a study group or about nine
people, but the members became
dissatisfied with the lack of action

and membership. The group then
changed its locus lrom study to
action.

It brought socialist Adam
Scheseh and Communist Party
member Claude Lightfoot to -
Grinnell and helped to bring
Winslow Peck, a member of the
Fifth Estate Group. The
organization also sponsored poetry _
reading in memory or the coup in
Chile, and participated in the food
conference. Films were presented.
and most recently, a “writein”
protesting U.S. aid to Indochina
was set up, which resulted in a
slight net loss {or the group.

Not only are activities varied,
but so are philosophies. One
member said that among the
students there are “socialists,
democrats. revolutionaries,
radicals and liberals,”

There are also several
philosophical similarities. Jessen
said, “There are basic principles
as tar as political ideology is
concerned. I'd say were anti.
imperialisiic. A lot of people are ,
socialists and really believe that
the capitalist system has got to be
overcome or transformed and that
people ought to do the tranr
storming.”

However, Jessen cautions
against characterizing the group
as radical. “We're not going to go
out and throw bricks and make a
scene and try to agitate," he said.
.. . . .We don't want to jump up and
say ‘Fucking capitalists!’ and spill

blood.”
