Cornell would be tough, but even

as embarrassing as it was. The
Rams won, 5670.

Cornell controlled the game troni
the start. its offense moved the ball
effectively and the defense suc-
ceeded in stopping the Pioneer
attack

Grinnell head coach Edd Bowers
said, “We just weren't ready to
play football at Cornell. We lacked
Concentration and made all kinds
of errors. For instance, we once
had Cornell in a third-down and 337
yard to go situation on its own
lhree~yard line and then gave away
a 97-yard touchdown,”

Bowers. who coached many oi
the poorer Pioneer football teams
ot the late sixties and early
seventies. added that this game
“WEISJIne ot.thc poorest Iootball

Rough week for women

by Toni Arcnlicrg

Few teams can complete a
season without hitting a slump oi
some kind. The Women’s volleyball
squad had a chance to do that, but
Its luck, or skill. ran out two weeks
ago. The Pioneers lost three
contests to drop their record to 127

Coach Tom Latimer cited nlidr
semester exams and a heavy
schedule that week ' hurling tlle

six matches between Oct. 19 and

was at Pella, 13., for a dual meet
with Cue College and Iowa
Wesleyan College. in two earlier
hook-ups, the Pioneers toppcd Coe
and played one of its best games ill
the season against Iowa Wesleyan,
but the relnatches were not as
successful.

The Kohawks won the first game
and captured the second, 16-14,
after trailing 11-3 “We fell apart,"
Latimer said. The first Iowa
Wesleyan game went to Gi-innell,
but the opponents rebounded to win
the match, 2-1.

The home season ended on Oct.
22 against Mount Mercy Collcgc. a

team that Grlnnell is tired of
playing, The two squads met tour
times this year and the 9-15, 15-13,

from victory at 14-11 in the
deciding game, but could not hold
on. Said Pioneer Claudia Kee about
recalling the last-minute tur-
naround, “It hurts ” With the
Pioneers' permission, Mt Mercy
used two varsity players in the JV
contest and Latimer said that was
the main reason Grinnell lost. The
JV's final mark is 472.

The varsity closes with the state
tournament at Ames this weekend,
Although Grinnell has very little
chance of gaining the title, it will
pick up valuable experience from
competing against top-notch ops
position and will probably add to
its season win total as well.

Ray Obermiller is optimistic that
