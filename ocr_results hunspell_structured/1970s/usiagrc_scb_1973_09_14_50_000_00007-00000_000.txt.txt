Next we go to an undeveloped
country which is in a state oi ems
ergency (Nigeria or lndia) and rent
(you can’t buy in this country) pear
sants in bulk (a gross at least)
and then place them strategically
around the campus (places like the
Forum Grill, Cowles, Quad, the
Post Office, etc.) and let it he
Iorbidden that they he led by any-
one. Anyone caught ioeding them
will go without food {or three days.
This is to teach the young OI this

V
I think that anyone caught teeding
a heggar a liith time should he
instantly passed in everything.

With Vietnam gone, Air Force Iir
ghter pilots must keep their eyes
in shape and quiet campuses, the
National Guard must continue to
improve Lind develop its riot con—
trol techniques somehow. Therer
tore, at least once a week, at un—
disclosed times, the Air Force will
be allowed to do mass strating
runs (with dummy amino, 01 course)

This will probably change all oith—
ose people who opposed the bombs
ing in theory (some or them to the
consternation oi their parents) to pe—
ople who oppose it in practice, who
oppose it Irom experience. And (or
those people who have never had a
Sherman tank stationed 50 yards
irom their iront doors (as l have),
the National Guard will come in
tor monthly head—busting sessions,
yust to give you a ieeling oi perser
cution which is not just the “menr
tal anguish” you are accustomed
to, but the fear OI actual physical
pain.

Lastly, we have an all»campus
seminar on Revolution; it the cam-
pus passed this seminar, 3 group of
young radical revolutionaries will
learn that not only is power hard
to use [or good, it is hardest to
maintain it against those who would
use it IOi" detriment.

They will also learn good ideals
are not enough; that in a radically
bad situation (such as in this coun-
try today), radically drastic measu-
res are the only recourse. That sym—
pathy is not enough, since sympathy
does not (ill stomachs.
