byMikewinston

The Grinnell chapter of the Iowa
Student Public Interest Research
Group (ISPIRG) recently Set
priorities on their campus ob-
jectives.

“In my opinion, the most critical
project at hand (or Grinncll is the
aquisition of credit for ISPIRG
related activities," commented
local chairperson Matthew Heine.
“While many students have an
interest in environmental, con-
sumer, and legislative retorm, iew
are able to devote their energies to
achieve practical results. ISPIRG
for Credit will alleviate this
problem,“ According to Heine, a
nuinbcr of Credit structures are
presently being eiamined, in:

play is being presented daily, at 8
p m,, irom November 7 - 13, in the
Arena Theatre.

The drama is set during th
I’fSﬂ’s in a iictitious, nearl
deserted Midwestern town, named
Eldtrich. Depicting the interaction
oi 17 characters, the play is
characteristic oi Wilson's “group
pr 'zanist" style since no in-
dividual is the hero.

Wilson uses a “College" method,
constantly switching irom scene to
scene, throwing many separate
images at the audience,
