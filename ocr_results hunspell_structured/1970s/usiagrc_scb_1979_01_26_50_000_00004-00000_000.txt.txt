son:- of his pa . sinus sharply

campus. and frustrated his desire to restore a community
feeling to Grinnell

Almost as soon as he arrived on campus, Turner became
embroiled in several controversies involving faculty and
students. Some were relatively insignificant. such as the
decision to switch from SAGA to FOG

OTHER ISSUES were more serious. Turner's tenure
proposal, which would have kept one position in every
department untenured, alienated many faculty members.
His standing among the faculty had only begun to recover
last semester.

But Turner’s effort in 1976 to reorganize the adminis-,
tration, more than any other factor, set the community‘
against him. Some students were upset because they were
not consulted in an administrative decision which directly
affected their recreational opportunities.

OTHERS WERE col 'ned because Georgia Dertel, an
experienced, capahie'actiVi es counselor, was going to be
replaced by someone with no background in booking musical
or theii 'lcal talent. And Grinnell women felt the ad-
ministra .ion displayed a callous disregard for their interests
by attempting to dismiss three women and replace them with
men.

The reorganization attempt, however, did more than
polarize the campus. It also scuttled any serious discussion
of the “White Paper,” a series of proposals for the college
offered by Turner to stimulate interest in the school's future.

TURNER, OF COURSE, has made several positive
contributions to the college during his term in office. The
most recent example was his proposal, which the rl‘rustees
accepted, to explore the possibility of converting Goodnow
Hall into an art gallery and Mears Cottage into the head-
quarters for the psychology department. Because of his
efforts, Mears Hall stands a better chance of survival.

He has also been a good fund-raiser, and that is an im-
portant quality in this era of inflation. He once said he en-
joyed “relieving people of hard—earned bread for higher
causes." With the formation of the development office and
his frequent fund-raising trips, Turner has displayed a knack
for attracting contributions.

MUCH OF THE hostility Turner has faced as president,

of course, could have been anticipated. Any leader is bound.

to make decisions which prompt opposition from Various
elements of the community,
But the tragedy of President Turner's term in office is that

it was his policies and actions which prompted such strongr

opposition. In the end, they prevented Turner from restoring
a sense of community to Grinnell.

Alum asks campus to support Mears

To the editor: Mcars Cottage may
not be Ihe most architecturally
excilllig Work on the Grinnell
campus. but it has achieved a
definite Significance through its
historical assumations and con,
tributions to Campus life. The
sentiment voiced in the 5&8
against the proposal to demolish it
demonstrates that this Significance
is not lost on the college com-
munity. In light of this concern and
the somewhat hasty and unin-
formed manner in which this
decision was made, a complete
reappraisal of the alternativa to
demolition is needed.

Throughout the country,
deteriorating building stock,
thought unusable previously, is
being imaginatively recycled and
given new life. in both urban and _
rural settings communities are
discovering that the benefits of
preservation are economic as well
as aesthetic. New tax incentives,
balancing the advantages .
established for new construction, -
are encouraging the rehabilitation

borhoods and the energy con» .

buildings is gaining increased .
appreciation. Aesthetically, we
now realize that new is not always ‘

architectural cohesiveness, and

community associates with its
history

The unconsidered demolition of
Meals Cottage would mean a
serious loss to the campus en-
vironment and the quality of life at
Grinnell. It would create a gaping
hole in the architectural landscape
of South Campus similar to that
created on Central by the
cemolition of the Women’s Gym in
1972. It would also deprive the
college community of a building
whose historical associations

directly reﬂect Grinnell's early
development and philosophy. For
these reasons alone, serious

consideraﬁon of rehabilitation and '

adaptive reuse of Mears should be
made. The physical environmeni
contributes as greatly to the
quality of life at Grinnell as any
other element, Make a comr
mitment to that quality; preserve
Meal-s.

Besides, can you imagine having
to tote Mr. Zirkle's sculpture over
to the former site of Mears next
year to symbolize yet another rape
of the college’s history and
heritage? After all, it too was
originally a women’s facility. Brad
Frandsen, ‘77.

North loggia a hazard

To the editor: There is a problem
which arises every winter, and
every winter passes without
anything being done to alleviate
the situation: the North Campus
luggia. The polished surface of the
loggia makes it hazardous to walk
to meals, classes, etc. when it

. snows or rains.

Enclosing the loggia would
perhaps be too much to ask (and
may not even be desirable), but it
seems to me that the possibility of
resurfacing could be considered. If

a layer oi rough concrete, or
whatever, could be added, walking
the North Campus loggia would no
longer be the most dangerous
experience at Grinnell. At the very
least, Salt could be used, and I can
see no reason why this hasn’t been
done. .

Come on, let's spend some of the
money we’re no longer wasting on
alcohol to resurface the loggia and
make it safe for us drunks to walk
home from the Pub. Valerie Lloyd.
