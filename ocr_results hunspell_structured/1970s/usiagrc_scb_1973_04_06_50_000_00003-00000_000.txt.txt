Meat Boycott: Striking A Better Balance?

by Brent Schondelmeyer
Though basically an omnivorous society, the American
consumer is usually characterized as a meat-masticating
potato~and~gravy entity who betweenibites is likely to
comment that “these are times that try men’s pocket»
books” This is not to ignore the housewife who for
various reasons on 3 national front has promoted mealr

ion and more recently a national meat boycott this past
week in response to the rising meat prices. As if ob-
serving a sleight oi hand trick with a silver dollar, all
want to know in whose pocket the money is going.

Grinnell has participated in the meat boycott on voluntary
basis with the ca-operation oi SAGA, AustinKoestler, who,
along with members of the new SGA cabinet, organized
the boycott, ”wanted Grinnell to participate to show
its support for the national boycott,” The boycott was
worked so that no beef, pork. or lamb would be served
at Quad dining hall. At Cowles two meat dishes were
being served as well as one meatless entree. Through
Wednesday, student meal counts at both dining halls
were the same as in previous weeks, though both experr
ienced some immigration and emigration, Meat consump»
tion was up at Cowles, though, as the heavy carnivores
from South went to North Campus for meals.

Food services director Jerry Ramaker commented this
week the eiiect oi rising meat prices on iood expenditures.
“I don’t see how we (SAGA) can come in next year without
a raise in board due to rising food costs”

In an attempt to offset rising food prices, SAGA is trying
to control “waste in buying, waste in the kitchen, and
student waste.” Meat prices for SAGA have doubled in
the last year. “There is nothing i can tell you that hasn't
gone up," Ramaker said.

A survey of the college-owned cavops revealed that a
number of the coeops planned to participate in the boy
cott. A number of the houses had bought quarter and half
sections of cows at the beginning of the year when prices
were lower, but now were unable to buy meat at current
prices. One house co-ordinator commented that last semi
ester they had had meat 4»5 times a week, but could only
afford meat once a week now. At another house a majority
of the people were Vegetarians to begin with and there-
fore didn't purchase any significant quantities of meat.

A married couple in Grinnell told this reporter that
they were buying meat, but much cheaper cuts. "Since we
were buying cheaper cuts of meat before the boycott
we had nothing to switch to.” Another couple said they
didn't consume much meat. but instead ate chicken,
fish and a lot of macaroni and cheese.

by John Wylie However,

Stephens admitted that

Visits to three oiiicrenl grocery stores round a diiierent
reaction to the boycott than was being experienced in urban
areas.

”They (customers) mention it to me. They’re impatient
with it: They sympathize with the farmer."

“I really couldn’t tell the difference in sales, though this
is the lust part oi the week. You can’t pin the blame on
any given person. There are so many hands.”

one grocer commented he hoped meat prices stayed
up. He also related a story about an ex~farnler's who
who bought $20 worth oi meat solely to show her support
oi the iarmer.

in a telephone interview with the sub, Butch Swain oi
the National Farmer's Organization (hm) tried to explain
the farmer’s perspective, "We haven't produced enough
red meat in this country since i950 tofeed our own people
and have thereiore imported more and more meat.
Farmers, because prices have been so low, have had to
sell their breeding stocks in the past to meet prices.”

The price ceiling would stop a rise in meat prices, he
said, but because oi a “manipulated market now by chain

dollars And programs like IrLITE,

stores” prices were being forced down and farmers
would have to absorb the brunt of the blow. “The family
housewife is being used to destroy the family iarmer.”

Mr. John Douglas, president of the Poweshiek‘County
uro, ielt "livestock prices were just beginning to reach
parity with other commodities,” He also felt that if meat
prices go down it would discourage meat production that
might result in a meat shortage at a later date, He related
how one farmer had cancelled plans for a hog production
facility because of the current market Situation.

The NFD was involved in a series of meetings coast to
coast Monday and Tuesday night enrolling new members
and establishing a Minuteman system where if prices
fell the members could get market advice readily from
the national headquarters in Corning, Iowa, about the
appropriate actions to take.

Economics Professor Robert Voertman commented on
some of the intricacies of (arm economics this week.
noting that “farms are one DI the few areas that is not
ciigarchical in nature, causing prices to be highly vola-
tile.” A sharp rise in personal income oi about my, in
recent years has allowed consumers to substitute meat
for other commodities in their diet. This is compounded
by the iact that the meat supply channel doesn't respond
well to short term changes since it takes anywhere from
in months to a years to get a cow ready ior market
from point of conception. Mr. Nixon's policy he feels,
is a political show that “would temporarily cure de-
mand," but might also result in sharp alterations in farm
investment.

One of the most interesting perspectives of the meat
boycott is that of the vegetarians. Student Brad Clompus
stated, “I support the eiiects oi the boycott, not the rea—
sons.” He stressed that the boycott didn’t get at the heart
of the issue, which was that meat consumption from a
dietary standpoint is wasleiul.

“We already have too heavy a dependence on meat and
the boycott is merely a move to alleviate a middle class
dilemma," he said. Clompus tell that the boycott might
make people aware 0! some of the many‘satisfactcry
subtitutes for meat. "As far as lam concerned meat
prices can go up.”

Most students seem to support the boycott, yet can
sympathize with the farmer, They are not surewhat affect
the boycott will have and its possible implications. In
contrast to the lettuce boycott, the issues are not so clear
cut. And all wonder what effect the economic trimming
intended by both the consumer and the government will
have: who will get the meat, who will get the fat, and who
will be leit gnawing on the bone.

_ Road Service

The future of IrLITE remains in
doubt while growing public aware-
ness oi possible cuts in the pro—
gram’s funding is beginning to sur-
face in the form of petitions and let-
ters to government oiiicials.

Denny Stephens, Regional Program
Officer for the Office of Education
commented recently that inter-line
rary cooperation programs like 1,
LITE were in serious jeopardy be
cause of the President’s current
budget proposals.

”Federal funding oilibraries is set
at the zero level for the coming fis-
cal year. This Administration be»
lieves that general revenue sharing
funds should be used instead ofcate»
gorical grants."

feeling."

By Monday, Jane and Amanda be-
gan talking to students and iaculty
about their experience. ”Essentially
we’ve been spreading consciousness
about securities. Some people are
aware oi the security problem on
campus, however most people don’t
know that thefts have been occurring
(or the past two years."

The issue became such a matter
of concern that last Wednesday it
was brought to Dean Walker’s open
forum.

When one observer asked about se-
curity measures employed on cam—
pus, Walker commented, “We have
been concerned about having a see
curity iorce on campus The come
munity has not been sympathetic
with having police here in the past,
and with that comes the absence oi
securities.”

A series of, suggestions were given
by the people attending the meeting
as to how to deal with the security
problem. A large portion ofthe suge
gestions dealt with physical changes.

However in Nina Adams sug
gested that part or the problem lies
in the attitude of the students theme
selves. “Most students don’ttakethe
problem seriously enough”, com-
mented Nina. A student suggested
that floor meetings be called to make
students aware of the problem and

the academic loop oi I-LITE would
be barred irom receiving such funds
by the provisions of the Revenue
Sharing Act, “This is either an inn
Ientional gap or an area not yet re
solved -- which one is not yet
clear."

A special educational revenue
sharing program; which could allow
tunding ior programs like I’LITE,
is currently pending in the House.
it would provide iunds beginning Jane
uary 1, 1974 for various educational
programs, libraries included.

Compete

Stephens emphasized, however,
that libraries would be competing
with many other programs inagiven
state or locality ior revenue sharing

to get students to challenge outsiders
in the dorms, A meeting has been
scheduled for next Wednesday night
to further discuss thedissatisiziction
oi security on campus. Attending
this meeting will be Dean Walker,
Chiei peters, Dean Kimbo, the col-
lege lawyer, and other members
oi the Grinnell community.

Jane and Amanda commented onthe
upcoming meeting, “We want to get
people to do something about the
problem or at least come to the
meeting and get concerned, No one
ever thinks about the problem until
it happens to you "

which serve regions rather than sp-
eciflc localities, will be especially
hard pressed because they willhave
to seek funds from individual cities
and counties as well as irom the
State.

Various groups around the nation
have begun organizing tor a fight
to retain federal funding of libs
rary cooperation programs under
the Library Services and Construc-
tion Act (LSCA). Among the most ei-
[ectlve so far is SLICE, a regional
program with headquarters in Dal»
las, Texas which serves a number
of southwestern states.

Inform

Stephens noted that the problems
posed by federal funds cutoiis to
successful library cooperation pro
grams are “legitimate”.

”The only thing people can do is
to iniorin government oi the prob-
lem, Now IS the time to inform
officials about what the problems
are ”

In Grinnell, the petition drive is
continuing, with several hundred
signatures recorded on petitions in,
