Grinnell Athletics: community conscious?

While some teams participate in regular community service projects, others are absent from the trend

liv MATT ZMUDKA

In 2006, the NCAA Division 111 Student Athetic Advisory
Council (SAAC) launched a community service partnership with
Habitat for Humanity. Tlie rlireeasemester partnership, now cont
cludiug, aimed to get at least 50 percent ofDivision Ill schools in-
volved in 3 Habitat home build via fundraismg or actual construe
tion. Subsequently, die Midwest Conference SAAC decided to
adopt it as this yeal’s service initiative for all conference schools.

Grinnell's pamcipation> Nonei

While some teams palticipate in frequent community service,
other team do not. Despite this inconsistency in service across
sports, there has been no signlticant attempt to encourage more
service across Grinnell athletics.

Community service is not foreign to some Grinnell's athletes

Grinnell athletes do community service, but for a school come
mitted to social justice, is it enough?

Athletic Director Greg Wallace chinks that Grinnell's pro-
grams are at least on the path In doing so. “Seventl of our teams
have been doing projects for a number otysars," he said, adding,
“Even in some cases where we don't have a whole team involved,
we have a number of individuals off teams involved in projects.“

for Grinnell’s SAAC, acknowledged that several teams did service
but said, “I think we can do more, in particular, getting athletes to
work on community service in their off-seasons." She could not
cite any service done by her softball team this yeai, for example.

“Griuiicll has been historically less active in community out
reach than some of the other schools [in the Midwest Confer-
ence]," Ward said, although she thought that SAAC's outreach
efforts in the past couple otyeats had been improving.

What is this mysterious Habitat initiative? Einily Pankow, nit
vision lIl SAAC chair and a 2007 graduate ofLuther College in
Iowa, explained that part or the goal or the national SAAC is to
create initiatives for divisi ewidc service. “Our job is to partner
up and create initiatives, so ira campus SAAC does not havc an
idea for what they can do for community sconce, we plant that
idea," she said.

The popular conception of athletics tends to exclude commu-
nity service, but athletes and coaches alike agreed that service was
important for teams to participate in, whether in small groups or
as a whole.

“it's important to demonstrate char you care about your sup-
porters and your community,"Ward said.“lt's easier for athletes to
appear as if they do not"

Pankow eaplained that the concept ofa ‘team' works well for
stories as well as athletics, especially at smaller schools. “The idea
of‘team' is perfect in motivating people to do good {or their com
munity around the campus," she said. "Itwotks out well, especially
in Divison Ill where athletics is not the sole focus of student atlr
letes."

To Wallace, the greatest challenge facing universal team com-
munity service was finding time to do projects. “There’s a little
extra time available during rho day, so rliat's a good time for us to
do some of those projects." Ward cited tinek athletes reading to
elementary school kids during their spring break trip to Florida
as an example.

SAAC’s goal, according to Ward, is universally "encouraging
the teams to do some ofrheir own stuﬁTVVith the kind ofresoutces
we have, it’s nice to be able to give a litde Liine baelt."

Service among all teams is a goal orWallaces too, but he said
that it would be impossible to make service mandatory for all atht
lttcs, He didn't rioti a resistance among athletes to service, how-
ever. "I thinle ifanytl ng, rliere's enthusiasm," Wallace said. “Once
they get involved, it's great to see how well our kids respond to the
little kids or adults, and vice vetsa."

in tact, die folksy, home-grown brand ofscrvice rliat Grinnell
practices was out in full force at the Dick Young Relays last Sat-
urday, when SAAC hosted a concession stand. “They were able to
provide hamburgers, hot dogs, hot chocolate to the people at the
meet and it went over extremely well,”Wallace said, adding that
money mised will hopeﬁllly be funneled back into charity.

However, Ward said that Grinnsll had not done anything
for Habitat for Humanity or the Special Olympics. both recomt
meudatlons from the conference SAAC, hindraisirig or otherwise.
Their main snort. multisport ﬁeld day, is a repeat of last year's
service project. "i'm really hoping to see sustained improvement in
our impact," Ward said.

The Pioneers have experienced both dominant victories and
needle-thin losses. While they have handily won their confer

match. “We took some iough 54 losses,” said Nat: Fox ’09. “I
was hoping that wouldn't happen this year."

This season the team saw some unexpected bright spots.
The Pioneers took on cue College and won, giving them their
