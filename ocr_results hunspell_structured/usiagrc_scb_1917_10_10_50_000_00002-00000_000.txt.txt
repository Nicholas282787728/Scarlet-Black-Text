DO l'OU CARE?

Out or over 600 \illpei'cl' students
and iaciilti- members who ii ere elig-
ible to vote at the student council
nomination yesterday, only 131 had
enough interest in the matter to Cast
a ballot,

Do you eai‘e how your semester fee
is spent? no you have beliefs in re-
gard to the place oi certain social ai-
iairs iii Gi‘il‘inell‘s life? Do you want
to have a voice in strident sellsgov-
ernuient?

If you do, vote at that oil- ion to-
ninr nw. Tire student council is sup
posed to represent student opinion.
How can it, when the students do not‘

take enough interest in it to choose]
the men and women who will repre-
sent their view. 7

Fortunately a representative group
of men and women were nominated
yesterday. It you are interested in
the live questions that will come upi
hclore the couneii this year, vote m'l

The most notable change in the
Scarlet and Black this year has been,
the reorganization of the stall into a
news-gathering iorce, instead or hay-i
ing it merely a newswtiting iorce. 3,

Extensive reorganization has i ,.
suited in tile modelling oi the start
alter that or a. city‘ newspaper. Im-v
portant classes oi news are “covered"
by department editors. Three men
“cover" sports, devoting their whole
time to the ﬁeld, Two men are lnill»l
tar-y cditoi-s, plan stories about the
local military work, and keep in touch
with the Grinnelliaiis in the service.

society news is covered L two
women. Two other reporters gl 0
entire attention to women’s neivs, in-
cluding athletics Every cottage in
the quadrangle is “covered” by a rc-
porter.

The adillihi ti'atlvc and college ots
iices make a ‘l'lln" similar to those
on city paper The library and lili-
eral arts departments, the science
building, etc, comprise diiierent
“runs Tire men’s dormitories aret
“covet-ct" in similar manner, athei-
reporters devote their titiic to (cathrc‘
and human interest stories.

Tire result oi this orgai cation is
an increased quantity oi news for the
paper, and réul newspaper training
tor the members oi the staﬂ. students
and taciilty members can materially
help the work by becoming acquainted
with the reporter who “covers" their
dormitory or eliices, and by telling
him any news item oi interest.

The student council proposes, the}
iaeulty d pos , i
A council is said to be, by the besti
authorities, an assembly loi consulta-
tion and deliberation Tire student
council oi Griniiell, is on the other
hand, little more than a committee to
apportion the hind coming ireiii tliei
semester tee.
it is supposed to talte on the duty oi
representing the student body in cnlr
icgc goierumcnl, biit in reality it liasi
l s to say about the goveinincnt of‘
Giiiiiiell than the reicnstag has to say}
about the policies at the German iin-
perial goveriuncnt. i
it is truly a deliberative, consulting
body. it deiiberates and consults with
great regularity, But all in vain, Tlicl
only power oi the student council oi,
Grinneil, in a legislative way, is tlte
power oi recommendation. The iace
iilty accepts the iipdings or this Callus
ch as representative oi student opiir
ion, and it it thinks that these ﬁndings
are worth consideration, it allows ele-
ts oi them to ﬁnd their way in to
a innoll'h category oi non-existant
rules.
without taking sides either way on
the dancing question, let us consider
the action oi the council, the action oi
the taculty, and the report made to the
students when that question was be
tore us. The council, alter iiiucii de-
liberation, drew up a plan which \vmlldi
bring the seven vacation dances to
the campus instead or leaving them

down town.

The faculty, which foresaw that
some step must be taken along these
lines, adopted the part about denotiig
being recognized on the campus, birt
cut the number from seven, the nuln~
her of done ~ that have been recog-
ri .ed for year , to ﬁve, And their r
