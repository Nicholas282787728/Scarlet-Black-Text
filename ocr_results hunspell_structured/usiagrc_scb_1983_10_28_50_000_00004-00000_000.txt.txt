What have
we learned ?

Next Monday the faculty will try to vote on ﬁle Parslow Proposal.
Before voting, however, they must decide which faculty members are
eligible to vote. They question, for example, whether visiting pro~
fessurs and faculty members hired for one year should receive a ballot.
To reach a solution, they must decide which faculty members are eligi»
ble to decide the question of eligibility. We hope that some vision brings
the faculty to a quick resolution of this dilemma. A vote next Monday
on the Parslow Proposal would come just in time — the entire affair
has lost its entertainment value.

Perhaps'the results of the Student Government CurriculumCommit»
tee questionnaire will guide the faculty to a just decision. We tend to
think otherwise A letter accompanying the questionnaire stated, “if
we do not receive a minimum of 75 percent return, the validity of the
entire project will be thrown into question,” The results, tabulated last
week and published elsewhere in this issue, indicate that 60 percent of
the students responded. However encouraging, this return falls short of
what constitutes a valid response.

Nevertheless, let us imagine for a moment that the validity of the
project, aside from response rates, still holds, Consider instead how
the questions were formed. For example, question number four asks:
“Do you favor the present proposal?” Only two responses are possible
— yes or no, The opinion of students who are undecided apparently
matters little to the Ad Hoc Committee,

Furthermore, the questionnaire muddles the issues surrounding cur-
ricular change. Question number eight asks: “Given that the college
has decided to evaluate its curriculum structures, what is your reac~
tion to the imposition of a set of distribution requirements (ire. the pro-
posal)?” Although the Parslow Proposal seeks to implement a set of
distribution requirements, not all proposals for distribution re‘
quirements seek to be Parslow Proposals. We wonder how many of the
448 students who responded negatively to question eight did so because
they disfavor distribution requirements, The results of the question-
naire raise many questions yet provide few answers.

We like to think that there is a lesson here, According to the cover
sheet accompanying the questionnaire results, SGA formed the Ad Hoc
Curricular Committee to survey student Opinion on the proposed cur-
ricular changes, The Committee would then use the student opinion to
prepare a student response to the proposed changes. In effect, the
SGA did for students what students ought to have done for themselves,
That is to say, individuals with strong convictions are also capable ,of
expressing these convictions. The views of students unwilling to pursue
their own best interests should hold no value. SGA, by using a com-
puter form to solicit opinion,'encourages sloppy thought and exalts the
mentally indolent, Students must think as individuals and not as cows,

individual responsible was either embarr

contents of the article, I must conclude it

was the former,

The first of several inaccurate points
was the writer’s statement mat bands
come to Grinnell only once a month.
Musical entertainment is brought to this
campus almost every week, in addition to
the large number of other cultural events.
In the first half of this semater seven
musical acts appeared on this campus. Not
one a month, one a week.

The biggest and stupidest inaccuracy,
however, came when Knox advanced the
absurd notion that “Instrumentals are
monotonous.” What drug was this person
taking when this idea entered their mind?
Does the writer include Classical and Jazz
styles in this ludicrous statement? Even if
one sticks to rock and roll, the instrumen-
tal groups that have contributed to rock's
rich history are countless: The Champs
whose classic “Tequila” is one of rocks
most sublime moments, Booker T, and the
M.G.'s hit “Green Onions” defined a style
that continues today, Bill Doggett’s
“Honky Tonk" was the true, transitim
from blues to rock, Johnny and the Hur
ricanes, Link Wray, Duane Eddy, the Sure
farais, and or course, The Ventures. These
groups helped define rock and roll. They
did it not by being monotonous or boring,
but with’exciting and original sounds.

To suggest that instrumentals are
monotonous only illustrates ignorance of
musical history. Commenting mat the
band were nice pants suggesm another
type of ignorance, ,

Halloween is, (excuse the cliche) just
around the corner. Chances are that this
weekend we’ll see the usual array of
ghosts, goblins and witches. That sounds
much like last year's Halloween, and that
of the year beiore, and the one before that,
and so forth. In fact, as holidays go. Hand
ween must be one of the most slagnant. It
is probably just as predictable as Colum-
bus Day.

Well, I sayhit is time we put a bit of lire
back into poor old Halloween. Remember
that in the Middle Ages, Halloween was the
night when the souls of the dead would
return to their homes, recline in their
favorite chair in front of the T.V.. and
smoke like fiends until dawn, (or until all
of the stations signed Dif). NOW these
spirits/won't even Show up at their old
haunts for fear that their dead survivors
will embarrass theml I mean, how would
you feel if you returned all the way irom
death, only to find your little brother pran-
cing about in a “Mr. T," costume,
shouting: “Yo Mama!"

Granted, the tradition is set. We certain-
ly are not going to revert to those bygone
days when one served munchies to a bunch

To the Editor.

I would like to thank everyone who filled
out the curricular questionnaire which was
distributed to all students by the Ad Hoc
Curricular Committee. 023 out of 1100
students responded and this return rate of
approximately 50 percent ur exccet the

[2 issue

Since there was such a high response
rate, I thought it would be a good idea to
explain why we had the survey and what
we did with the results SGA formed the
Committee to survey student opinion
regarding me proposed changes in the cure
riculum, in the belief that an all-campus
survey would serve several goals. First,
answering a quesuonnaire would make
students aware of the proposed changes in
the curriculum. Second, the results would
serve as an indication of what recommen-
dation SGA should make to the faculty
regarding the present proposal. Third, the
results of a well-conducted and fair Survey
would be useful to the professors in meir
deliberations on the curriculum.

The results showed thafstudents were
strongly against the present proposal. I
sent a statistical report of the question-
naire results to all the faculty. Pete Hautz-
inger, SGA VicePraident, also sent a
report to all the faculty based an die com-
ments people wrote on the back of the
questionnaire. I still urge students to 9x7
press their opinion about this matter to
their professors, in addition to the reports
that have already been sent. ~ Yours tril-

of apparitions 7 but we can be more
original than we are. Take, for instance,
the tradition or wearing costumes. Witch,
skeleton and ghost costumes are fine, but
when was the last Halloween that you saw
someone disguised as Henry Kissinger?
Now that's what I call a really scary
costu Imagine the frightening
possib es of a James Watt, or Phyllis
Schlailey costume.

But I'm afraid (see, it’s worlo'ng) that
these costumes will never be the norm.
Rather we are subjected, year after year.
to the ”boxed” costume. You know, the
kind that you see at Alco — they are the
ones consisting of a molded plastic mask
and a plastic smock. The mask is an ex-
pressiunless representation of a “super-
hero” or cartoon character; the smock
carries a caption telling you whom the
wearer is dressed as, For instance, one
caption might read: “I am dressed as
‘Super-phlegmball’, gimme some candy."

The problem with these costumes is that
they are simply not irightening. Who
would ever run in ten-oi- irom a ten-year
old dressed as Strawberry Shortcake? The
only thing that is frightening about the
boxed costumu is that they sell.

But enough of this pessimism. Hano-
ween is a time {or mischief and merri-
ment. Hey, this year I want everyone to
know that I have found the most sincere
pumpkin patch in the whole world, and the
Great Pumpkin will swoop down and
shower me wiui presents, and. . . .
