BEST IN MANY YEARS

A WEALTH OF NEW 31E)"

Ere-501180“ Outlook Is a Bright one —
Blith'ry Men Especinlly Abund-
nut~ii liccting.

“The best prospects since the days
we won the championships," was the
remark made by a prominent member
oi last year's baseball team yesterday.
in referring to the outlook for the com-
ing season. Already the irrepressible
baseball fan has made his estimates
and the above statement has been cor-
roborated in many a discussion oi the
season’s prospects. This habit of Op-
tlmlsm is 8 weakness Whlch attaches
the College man at the beginning or
every ethletic season, but this year
there seems much warrant for ELIOT!
laith in the prospects before the team.
It the end oi this year-s baseball
schedule does not witness a triumph
ior Iowa College, it will be either be-
rcauSa the material at hand was poorly
handled Or the other colese teams are
vastly superior to those or previous
years.

Although just at present a low oi
the men are laboring under Scholastic
difﬁculties, it is expected that by the
beginning of the masculine team Will
have ht its command the best mater—
iel in school. Never was a team bet-
ter Supplied with batteries than this
year's promises to be. Smithson, Barr
her and Jainlgan are all good [will-
as and should be able to make the
Willesi. of the collegial: ”stickers" (an

Noll ct two years ago, Loos, the old
Beiolt backstop and Wandward will
all work out behind the hat. Both
VCarney and Noll have made good in
previous years, while Loos showed
last SEBSOD while playing With Scrubs
that he Was equal to the best of them
both in receiving and in betting.
Woodward played in a EQW games sub—
stituting ior Carney litst year.

Greenwood Will Work out at ﬁrst
again, here with a season-s experience
he should play a great game. Both
Carney and Rogers Will also be given
a trial here. Farrens, ”Stub" Ham-
mond, Warriner end Smithson, when
not in the box, Will all. be available
for the inﬁeld positions. Farrens With
his experience of last year Should put
up )1 good ﬁght for his place at Seer
ond. Seth Hammond and Warriner
showed up well in practice last sea—
son as clean ﬁelders. sure throwers
and rain batters. in previous seasons
Smithson has played at both short and
second and, it needed, could ﬁll either
at these positions. The pitchers
should be ably supported, So tar as
the Inﬁeld is concerned.

tions oi men like Warriner, Loos, Noll

Yesterday‘s ﬂames Besnlmd in Senior
and Sophomore “Modem—-
FIST. Work.

With the exciting 'varslty baskets
ball games holding all attention, the
women's basketball series might be
expected to seem tame, but the large
crowd which witnessed the games on
Tuesday alternoon found teams well
trained and in good trim. In the Sen»
ior-Junior gsme, in spite oi their mil»
ure to score. the Juniors made a good
Showing, keeping the ball in their ter—
i-ilory most oi the time, made the '09
stars look to their laureis. Lela Weld-
errecht did some last work in passing
the ball up to the forwards, while
Maud McKown and Rene Morris got
in good team work at guarding. Ada
Peterson played well at sub-center.
Helvig Anderson overjumped hcr op-
ponent at center.

tended to the balcony on all sides
thousands oi streamers blending to—
gether all the colors oi the rainbow.
Flowerrsliaded incandescents around
the balcony, added greatly to the ei»
test.

The early part oi the evening was
taken up with playing a progressive
game, modeled along the lines oi the
popular “Pani . A dozen small tables
were decorated with as many plhcnrds
representing diirereht stations be-
tween Grinnell and Chicago. At a
pistol shot two heart-shaped boxes
dropped ircm the ceiling somewhere,
and in these boxes the guests iouud
their pnrtners and the stations trom
which they were to start, The game
was to reach Grlnnell.
