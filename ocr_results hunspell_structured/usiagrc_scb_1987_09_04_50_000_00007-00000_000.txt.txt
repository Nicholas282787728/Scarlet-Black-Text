to improve upon last year’s 3-5
record. For those of you who are
unfamiliar with Pioneer football,
here’s a review of what happened
last year.

The team opened with a promise
mg 24-17 victory over a tough team
from Concordia of Milwaukee. The
Pioneers' momentum was then
broken when the next game was
cancelled due to foul weather.
Grinnell lost the next three deci~
sums to Lake Forest, st. Norbert,
Coe, and Monmouth before bounc-
ing back with a monumental upset
or Cornell, a perennial conference
powerhouse. The team also suf~
fered a setback against Knox
before defeating Illinois College
in the last game of the season, The
1986 Pioneers were 2-5 and finished
flftll in the Midwest Conference
Southern divismn.

This Saturday at 1 PM . the

Graceland College at Rosenbloom
Field. The regular season opens on
Saturday, September 19 with the
fll'St game at Concordia of lllinois.

ted at one time or another last year.
On offense, the Pioneers will con»
tinue to run out o[ a runrandsshoot

new look, using a +4 scheme
rather than the 572 look 0[ last

Heading

for

Nationals

by Grant Ehrlich

The Pioneer soccer team is gear-
ing up for another incredible
season. Returning to the turf are
nine of last year's starters, six of
whom were allvconference. Add to
that a few star freshmen, and you
have a team destined for nationals
and beyond.

Attacking and penetrating the
opponents’ end or the field will be
sensation KJ Knoll, who is
leading the twnsstriker front line.
Backing them up will be the
Veteran skills of captains Rick
Roddis and Mark Gempler with the
aid of star freshmen Dave Monaco
and Steve Fairchild. The key
players in the insurmountable
defense are back from last year:
goalies Randy Seely and Dave
Shane They are insulated by the
incredible, just plain awesome
fullback line led by center fullback
Brad "Biz~BuZz” Bisgard.

Once these amazing athletes ex~
ccute Coach Pfilsch’s new revolus
tionary oirense and perfected
defense, this Division-Ill team will
be raised to the national status it
deserves.

The team will have a scrimmage
against the alumni on Sunday at
10:30 A M, before they load the bus
to Minnesota for a pair of high
caliber matches. Although the
names of players in this Sunday‘s
game are still a mystery, it is
rumored that perhaps such Grin
nell greats as Herbie Hancock,
Robert “Chip"Noyce, and Gary
“High Noon" Cooper may be found
in the grandstands. Later in the
season, if all goes as planned in
conference and regional competi-
tion, the team will travel to Califor-
nia for nationals and then off to
Argentina [or a mueh-talked-ahout
match against the defending World
Cup champs.

Women:
Cross

country

by Houston Sanders

Despite the loss of the top two
runners from last year's Midwest
Conference runner-up team, the
Grinnell Women‘s Cross Country
team expects once again to con-
tend for the conference title.
Almough it is unlikely that any in-
dividuals will be able to replace top
runner and threestime conference
champion Shavaun Adams or last
year's numbertwo runner Jens
nifer Bishop, Coach Evelyn
Freeman hopes that the returning
veterans and several new addis
tions will make up an even
stronger team.

X-country

by Houston Sanders

The Grinnell College Men's
Cross-Country team, also known as
the Purple ’Roos, will he a strong
favorite to repeat as Midwest Con-
ference champions in 1937. Seven
of the top l0 runners from last
year’s team are back, including
conference ,champion Greg
“Dangerous” Evans, Steve Piper,
lvan Lorkovic, Geoff Hoops, Kent
Koth, and 1987 conference track
champions Jonathan Lave and
Nick Hopley. in addition to these
veterans, this year's freshman
class appears to be among the
strollgesi in Grinnell's history.
while they expect to have tough
competition from conierenco
rivals Knox, Cornell. and
Lawrence, the team's number-one
goal this year will' be to improve
on last year ssth- -piace linish in the
NCAA regional meet. Coach Will
Freeman would also like to see his
team appear in the NCAA Division
in top-20 rankings, which they
cracked into for the first time near
the end of the 1536 season, A first
or secondsplace finish in the
regional meet would qualify the
team for the NCAA national cham-
pionship meet.
