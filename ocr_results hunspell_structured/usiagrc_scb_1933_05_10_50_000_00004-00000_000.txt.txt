Grant 0. Gale
Speaks at First
Senior Chapel

Humility of spirit, a tolerant attls
tilde, and temperance in all things
are three of the greatest qualities
which young men and women
acquire, according to Grant 0. Cole,
assistant professor of physics. who
spoke at the first of the series of
senior chapels Tuesday morning.

As a theme for his address, Mr.
Gale made a comparison of the 1933
senior class and the first classes to
graduate from Grinnell in 1854 and
1856. “This senior class, indeed, is
outstanding," he stated, "Its mem-
bers have powerful automobiles, per-
fected radios, overstuffed furniture,
later hours and dancesimore than
any other class before them. Yet,
other classes seem to have been out»
standing without all the speed, pow»
er, comfort and ease so symbolical
of our present age."

According to Mr. Gale. in 1860
when Iowa college was moved from
Davenport to Grinnell, students were
forbidden to dance, play cards, use
tobacco or alcoholic beverages, or to
date except on Saturday afternoons.
There was no electricity or steam
heat; instead students were obliged
to tamper with kerosene lamps and
to haul ashes from tiny stoves in
third floor rooms of boarding houses,

"By means of all the advantages
of this generation there should be an
attempt to solve the great mystery
of life, and to come into a closer
touch with God who is the spirit con-
trolling the cosmic forces of nature."
he said.

He declared that Grinnellians
should preserve the memory of those
original Pioneers. especially those
Gold Star dead from the classes 0!
1865 and 1918,
