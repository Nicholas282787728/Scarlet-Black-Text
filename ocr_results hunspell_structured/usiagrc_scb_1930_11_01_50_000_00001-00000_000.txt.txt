Wallace Says
High Tariffs

Now Harmful

i

Magazine Editor Addresses

Homecoming Chapel
This Morning

High tariff, once necessary to the
development of these United States,
is now harmful in that it creates a
feeling that the country no longer
desires trade. is the belief of Henry
A. Wallace, editor of Wallace's Far-
mer, who spoke on “Farm Problems"
at Homecoming chapel at 10 o’clock
this morning. His address was pres
ceded by President J. H, T. Mai s
welcome to the alumni, and the Sing~
ing of the alumni song by the Grin-
nell Glee club.

In discussing his subject Mr. Wal—r
lace pointed out that the present con-
dition of farmers was the result of,
three situations: technilogical, chang-
ed international relationships, and
the monetary standard.

Increased Production Reason

Increased production by improved,
farm_machinery, and the lack of pro~
portionate demand for foodstuffs in.
the United states was the first face
.tor developed.

The fact t at people have failed to
grasp the significance of the Chang:
ed relationships between the United
States and Europe, Mr, Wallace con-
siders one of the principal factors
contributing to the present state of'
affairs.

While a high tariff was necessary
for the development of this country
in its early years, Mr. Wallace made
it clear that now it is not only on
