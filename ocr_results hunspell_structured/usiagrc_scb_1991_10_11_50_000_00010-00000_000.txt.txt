No, she abhors them, if she is aware
of them. She thinks that homosexual-

extent she is Eurocemrt‘e!

Look around you. People are celr
ebrating the love they share without
shame or guilt.

Some Queerfolk find itdiflicultto
deal with NCOD. Most of the argu-
tnentsagainstitareforprivacy.“What
I do in my bed is a private matter. It’s
private. Not public." Of course the
main problem with living your life
like this is laws. You may think it’s
private.butbclieve me,sister,youare
the only one. If it were private,
wouldn’t it be respected as such and
not brought up as charges for firing
someone? If itwerepnvate,wouldn’t
it be illegal to be arrested for making
love to a person of the same gender as
yourself, rather than the other way
around? What happened to “right to
privacy“? A problem that arises from
the general nonracceptance of Queers
for those whochoose to remain silent
is the stress of keeping a secret, espcr
cially if you are living one life as a
Queer and another as a straight per-
son. How long can you lie aboutyour
friends, and lie about who you love,
and lie about what you do after work?

In fact, how long can you not say
it? IT. The word. Say it. I’m gay. I'm
a lesbian, I must be bi. Say it. You
may think we all know. How can we
know ifyou won‘tsayit'l Affirm who
you are. You can‘t fall; there are
Queers galore to catch you.

As for the 60-or-so percent of
straight people out there: Don‘t be
fooled. Even if the button-wearing,
slogan-chanting Queer in front of you
shows no sign of faltering, there is
always a momentofconcem. There is

Why not ditch ‘em and save some
