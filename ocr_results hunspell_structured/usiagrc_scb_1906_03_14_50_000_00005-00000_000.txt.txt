There are several yoirng people
whose parents attended Grinncll at

kept of these, it was impossible to
gather facts regarding them.

The number of those whose parents

.liirriy sacred rnemoiics arise in at

icriipiiug a response to your request
IOi‘ .r rnessugc regarding the phase or
college lire wiricli has meant most to
me since ibirriug the classic halls oi

Ainrtt Mirror, Jr is dilticrrlt to mention

any one pirrise, but the high intellect
rial, social and religious ideals cher-
rsired then, as now, by lowa College
iruie iniiuenced my whole lric. A Sent
Lance “LLOYDLJ. by a illissiouztl‘) Scorc-
lit!) in tin address bct‘ore the students
inurio a great impression hired me,

and so much upon the prospective

graduating class that it was adopted

us the elirss motto: "Make the most

or the best that is in you."

The Alumni of iowa College have
"blessed the wide world round," yet
how could it have been otherwise it
they LhLLl proved true to the standards
placed before them by Trustees and
chulty! The students ielt on gradu-
ating that lielpl‘ul, beautil'ul opportuni
ties [or service awaited them in the
world's gr at harvest lields, and that
it would be a joy to endeavor to make
the most‘ol‘ the best that was in them,
though deeply regretting that the ne
coniplishment must tall so tar short at
their dcsir .

The Gliilnell spirit, so ntten meu~
tioned now, and oi which we are all
Jllslly proud, was potent and persua-
sive even in the days or long ago and
should we not say from the very
rounding at town College? May it ever
abide in strength and beautyt

with unswerring loyalty to our Col-
lege and a strong taith in its conﬁne
ried prosperity and usetnlness.

Very sincerely yours,

VBCMI- asiied to contribute some
tiring to tuis number or ”Scarlet and
Black," ll‘um my experience as 3). Stir
dent in iowa college, l want to ex-

press to the girls in school now my

I appreciation oi the literary societies,

iLlle benclit and pleasure they aliord
to their members. some gil‘ , When
they enter college, reiuse an invitation
to ,rolu a society and thereby deprive
themselves oi one or the most belle»
lrcral and enjoyable teaturcs cl college
life. '

in the early days the sentiment,
' What is a college without a society?"
led up to the founding ol our various
literal) organizations. When 1 try to
think ot what my coilege lite would
have been without “society" and til:
irrendships i made there, 1 reel more
strongly than ever the desire to‘urgc
the present students to avail LhE‘lllr
selves oi the opportunity or member-7
ship in some one at those organiza-
tiuns. Aside lrom class relations.
there is nothing in dry college do a
which i recall with more pleasure
than dear, old Calocagathia.

May 1 add a word to you girls who
are \vol'liiug in the societies tor-ay ,'
lllake YOURS the bcst possible. Work
with the ambition at making it better
and stronger because at the tact that
your individual class is represented
there. The temptation is to waste vol-
uahle time in irivolous, nonsensical
programs. Some in you must have,
but in the main try to matte whatever
socie‘ you are a member or stand
pre-e ently tor the words, 'lue
Good aim the Eenutrtul.“

THE LIGHT IN THE WEST.

(From Alumni Hull.)
0, the Light in the West waters low,
When the first Spring night comes
on,
The Mm’chy breeze through the lin-
den trees,
Is singing on old, old song

And Smell) clouds that are ﬂoating
low,

Grad gold in the sun’s last ray,
Art) piling swltt a wonderful drift,

To end the glory of day

Across the Light in the West there
comes
The shade of a stately tower,
That watches there in the twilight
fair,
The throbbing joy oi the hour.

It marks a place in the Western sky,
As the shitting shadows fade,

The silent dome is the sign of home
To those who toil in its shade.

0, Light in the West, lhou’rt almost
gone,
For the ﬁrst Spring night has come,
But we pray to hold this thrill new;
old7
The ﬂitting light past our dome.
