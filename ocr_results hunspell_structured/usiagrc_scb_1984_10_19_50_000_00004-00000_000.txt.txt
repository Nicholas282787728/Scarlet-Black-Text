A plea for activism

The activity-level of progressive students at Grinnell
has increased greatly this year — a great sign for the
future Congratulations and appreciation are due to those
activists on campus who have helped prevent the campus
from becoming an apathetic wasteland, as many other
colleges have been for quiet some time.

Students for Ending Apartheid (S.E.A.)

Women‘s Group

Socialist Party

Amnesty International

Latin American Study Group (L.A.S.G.)

Freeze and Disarm

Community to Revitalize Progressive Education and
Activities at Grinnell (C.R.P.E.A.G.)

We salute you!

All the above groups have much hard work to do for the
the next half of the semester, but their past ace
complishments have foreshadowed a bright future.

This year, groups of students have gone to the S.A.C.
Base in Omaha, the Progressive Student Network Con-
ference in Philadelphia, the Chicago Peace rally, the
Take Back the Night March/rally in Des Moines, the Fer-
raro campaign speech in Ames, and the Socialist Party
meeting in Cedar Rapids.

Additionally, the Freeze and Disarm Peace Vigil,
Women‘s Group speakers and various groups’ literature
tables have helped educate the college community and in-
crease political consciousness.

One’s consciousness can always use a little broadening,
and of all the places students will venture in their lives,
Grinnell should probably be one of the most influential in
consciousness-raising. As people committed to the pur-
suit ol learning and positive participation in society, it is
imperative we emerge ourselves in new ideas, differing
modes of niought, and increasingly diverse perspectives.

So, look for those and other groups on posters and in the
campus memo and get to work on expanding your
political consciousness

Sure these groups don’t have all the answers, but what
you can bring to them' is another pair of eyes to search for
the answers, another perspective, and another hope for
the future. So don’t just concern yourself with History
101, work on History 2001 7 our future.

An early realization of mine was
that finicky eaters shouldn't run
for certain political offices. One
has to eat everything and can
never be known to have resultant
digestive problems. For instance.
running for Mayor of New York
City requires a detailed tood agen-
da. One must have knishes and
blintzes on the Lower East side
hot dogs on Coney Island. pasta |n
Little Italy, a several course meal
in Chinatown. popcorn at a Mets
or Yankees game, and some
chit'lins uptown in Harlem.
Despite the abundance of quiche
7 and 7 sprout eaters on Manhat-
tan‘s Upper West Side, no one
ever gets to be Mayor of New
York City through macrobiotic
vegetarianism,

Reagan and Mondale. on the
other hand. have been very low-
key on food during this election.
Reagan, perhaps trying to show
his commonality with Joe
Average, was recently shown at a
McDonald’s where,’ after con-
sultation with top aides. he ate a
burger, fries and iced tea. As a
"seasonedH food observer, 1 am
disappointed that he has so little
to do with any of the great ethnicir
ty oi this nation's eating habits.
The only thing anyone seems to
remember about Mondale's
eating preferences is a iondncss
ior checseburgers. Are they both
trying to show us their manhood
by eating solid old American beef
land Mondale's topped with

pasteurized process cheese food;

yet)? Granted, Mondale's
regional fare. lutefisk and leisa. is
not guaranteed to be a major
political asset. but why has
Reagan not courted the Chicano
vote of California with tacos and
chili’.’ A seventy-three year old
WASP doing that would surely
convince us of his Vigor.

They're not the first food
dullards in the Presidential
limelight. though. Richard
Nixon’s tavorite lunch was cot-
tage cheese and ketchup. Gerry
Ford's first breakfast in the White
House was waffles and strawber-
ries - tasty but unimaginative.

The time is ripe ior the curry
eaters and spaghetti slurpers to
have a candidate they can identify
with on the national level — one
who can appreciate the “melting
pot" in the all its glory.

It's amazing what comments
the Republicans have been mak-
ing about Ms. Ferraro. it seems

suits makes her opponents look
far Worse, Their naivete is strikr

precedents. After Mrs. Bush call-
ed Ms, Ferraro a ”four million
dollar 7 I can‘t say it but it
rhymes with rich”. she claimed it

dear Mrs, Bush, is oil-the—record
unless so stated BEFORE the
remark is made. One should also
know that that still won't make it
othe-record it said to a jour-
nailst on a press plane. Mr. Bush's
remark about “kicking a little
ass" also plumeted new depths oi
tastelessness, especially coming
from a candidate who frequently
likes to cite his massive governr
mental experience.

The week oi the GOP convention
in Dallas, Newsweek
photographers gave us one oi the
most vivid displays ever oi the
ooniiicting roles oi women in
American society, and its
manifestation in party politics,

The photograph on the leit
showed Messrs. Reagan and Bush
on an outdoor podium, looking
delighted. Between them were
two Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.

The photograph on the right
showed Mr. Mondale and Ms. Fer»
rarc. poised and calm.

Doesn’t it amaze us that there
are women willing to be the
cheerleaders when they could be
the heroines?
