Adviser-student relationships can be stronger

As of Friday, sophomores have three days
left to choose an academic advisor and declare
a major. For most students, the relationship
with the advisor is a positive and productive
one, where professors provide useful advice
based on ongoing knowledge oftheir advisees.
For a few students, however, the relationship
becomes negative: advisers dash offsignaturcs
each semester without comment, suddenly go
on leave without informing their advisees, or
speak condescendingly
about a student’s career _, r ,
plans. Students should
be better instructed in
the ways to deal with
these dysfunctional sits
nations so that all stur
dents can beneﬁt from
the excellent opporlw
nines offered by Grinnell’s advising program.

Grinncll works hard to coach faculty in the
advising role. All fullrt'lme permanent faculty
are required to serve as advisors as part of their
contract, According to joyce Stern, Dean for
Student Academic Support and Advising, the
Academic Affairs office provides many re
sources for facrrlty, including an advising hand—
book, two mandatory workshops and optional
Summcr workshops. Faculty are encouraged
to sit down with new advisccs and talk about
the roles and expectations ot the advising l‘Cr
latronshrp. And Grinncll evaluates professors
adi .ing efficacy by surveying adr cs when
faculty come up for review.

But the advisor/advisee relationship is nle
tirnarelv an individual one that depends on
the student, the professor and their dynamic.

mink that in;

'Siafijiidiioriai .,

some students want extensive guidance and
mentoring, while others resist any suggestion
their advisers make. Some professors Inkl’
ate conversations about offrcampiis study and
post—gmduate options, and some take a pas-
sive approach. The open nature of the adviSt
ing system allows for the ﬂexibility we prize
at Grinnell. The problem is rhar not all come
binarions work out, and when students and
professors butt heads, or when passive profCSr
sors are matched with shy,
intimidated students, very
little advising occurs.

Many faculty members
are amazing advisors and
mentors who go above and
beyond what is required of
them. A few advisors, hOWr
ever, fall down on the job
by being openly uninterested or disrespectful
toward their advisees. Faculty members who
neglect their advising duties deprive students
oforic of the key aspects ofa Grinnell cditcar
tion. Grinnell’s advising program provides the
amt mg opportunity for students to get per
sonal' ed, knowledgeable advice from those
who know Grinnell academics bcst~srlidcnts
at man ltools do not have this luxury This
make it even more oil loss for students when
prol'essors ii to live up to their responsibility,
In these tr. students should be comfortable
cxcl‘clslng their right in change .idvisors rather
than suffering through a relationship that is
not working.

But many dysfunctional advising Yelallol‘k
ships are based not on problem pro c ois, but
on poor commtinicalimt, In these cascs, Shi’

dents must take an active role in making the
advising relationship work. Students should
clearly communicate what they desire from
their advisors. The Academic Affairs office
could empower students to do this by providr
ing concrete information about the roles and
responsibilities of advisors. These resources
could come in the form of handbooks, pre-
sentations and open forums, beginning durr
ing N50 and continuing throughout the four
years. When students are equipped with ine
formation about choosing, working with and
changing advisors, they Will be better equipped
to rake an active role in the advising relations
ship.

This active role should also involve the op»
portunity for evaluations. If each senior ﬁlled
out an advisor evaluation, similar to a course
evaluation, before graduating, professors could
receive feedback about their strengths and
weaknesses and improve for the future Ad»
ditionally. the Academic Affairs office could
monitor the feedback and work with advisers
who receive negative reviews. If certain pro»
fcssors received drastically lie ative feedback,
Academic Affairs could considei removing
rhern from the advising pool.

We do not expect adVisois to act as menr
tor, best f end, or therapist to each .ulviscc It
is perfectly legitimate, and important, for star
dents to bc mentoicd by professors othei than
their official adVIsoi'. Howcvcr, there are basic
duti . that every atltasoi should be iequircd to
fulfill, and if students are made aware ofwliar
those are,we will be better equipped to be plus
active in holding up our end of the advising
relationship.
