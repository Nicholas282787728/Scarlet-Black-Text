LETTERS

To the editor, .

i am responding to the December 6
Scarlet and Black editorial entitled "SGA:
ignoring the Student Body". In this
over-dramatization, a single anonymous
editorial writer of the M editorial staff
made harsh accusations based on partial
information regarding "the sneaky way" SGA
approved the establishment of a Gay
Resource Center without consent of the
student body. it is to these empty
accusations that i wish to respond.

First, i wish to clarify the use of the
SGA referendum system. The referendum
system of which the editorial spoke is a
system primarily designed for student
initiative on political issues beyond the
scope of the campus. Specifically, it is open
to student proposals on issues of state,
national, and/or international importance,
but can also address campus concerns. it is
not a referral system for Joint Board on
sensitive campus issues. It is an instrument
to which a proposal initiated by concerned
student(sl With the affirmation of two
hundred signatories is put forth to the
campus community for a final vote. Hence,
the referendum system is outside the
purview of Joint Board's decision-making
authority.

Second, the manner of Joint Board's
ruling needs to be accurately presented. On
November 20, Jomt Board approved a letter
to be sent to the Office of Student Affairs
"urging Student Affairs to provide the
Grinnell College campus with a Gay Resource
center. . . The SGA, however, has not
suggested any detailed plans, as the body
prefers to leave the specifics of
establishing a center to your discretion."
The letter from Joint Board was simply a
suppartive action recognizing a concern of
many members of the campus community,
gay and nongay alike, to a GCGC initiative.
Joint Board's decisionvis not a "decision to

institute a Gay Resource Center" as stated
in the editorial The editorial misconstrued
Joint Board's ruling to mean the SGA
creation and establishment of a Gay
Resource Center.

Third, in response to the accusation
that the “issue deserved more than one week
of debate,“ the unknown author of the
editorial should have done his/her homework
to ascertain the actual proceedings of Joint
Board. Specifically, at the November l3
Joint Board meeting, the GCGC solicited SGA
support for the GCGC request to the Office
of Student Affairs for the consideration of a
Gay Resource Center Joint Board debated
and approved GCGC‘s request ("W/'66" during
the November i3 meeting and after an
appeal at the November 20 meeting. in
addition, the mysterious author asked "why
wasn‘t I, or anyone outside of the SBA
clique, asked about the issue?" To a
bewildered editorial writer l respond that
information on this issue was available long
before both meetings in the SGA Agenda and
Minutes posted in the Post Office and in the
dormitories. Before all Joint Board
meetings, Hall Senators are available for
student input and feedback Thorough
information and avenues of communication
are there; it is a student‘s prerogative if
he/she chooses to use them. Granted Hall
Senators and the Joint Board minutes were
the only places for the campus to gain
information on this matter; it is unclear
why the E failed to cover it in both its
November l5 and November 22 issues,

It is important that students are
aware of SGA resources available to them
and I hope that l have clarified the puroose
of one of these resources, the campus-wide
referendum. it is equally important that the
Sal—B knowledgeably present these resources
so as to not mislead and misinform the

student body, as it (or someone) did in last
week's SELB editorial.
