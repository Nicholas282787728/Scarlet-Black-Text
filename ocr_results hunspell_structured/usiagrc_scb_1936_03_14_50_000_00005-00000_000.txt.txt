Stage Technician

Play ‘No Women Wanted'
Causes Production
Problems

The crash of an airplane clip-
ping off a pontoon on a tree in
the midst of a thunderstorm and
landing in deep water is only one
of the technical difficulties involv-
ed in producing “No Women
wanted," to be given by the drama
department Mar. 23 and 25. Carl
C. Johnson, technical assistant in
‘the drama department, told in an
interview yesterday of the various
kinds and arrangements of orange
icrates that were broken up before
a realistic effect was found. The
final solution is a series of differ:
ent kinds of orange crates piled
up. with a heavy plank on top, and
pressure exerted to break them
with the proper splintering sound

Splashing caused by two girls
diving from a six-foot balcony was
another problem, It involved the
experimenting with several differ--
ent kinds and weights of objects
dropped into a barrel of water he-
lfore the right‘ effect was produced.
”This play calls for everything
.under the sun in the way of props," '
Mr Johnson declared. "We have
had to find or imitate everything
from blue-berries to a fishing fly
hook."

Synchronization of the sound
effects with dialogue and businessI
has been one of the most difficult
problems of all, Mr Johnson said
An ingenious device for making a
rattlesnake rattle at the precise

Colorful Swim Suits
Featured in Pageant

Colored swim suits were one of
the outstanding features of the
swimming pageant given in the
college pool last night. Forty Con
eds participated in exhibitions and;
drills under the direction of Missi
Leone Crosby. instructor in Womel
en's physical education,

White, blue and coral I‘uhber
suits were worn in the floating
formations, the stunts, and the
waltz crawl. Black, brown, red,
green and blue suits were wom in
the other events. Colored spot-
lights were focased on the pool to
bring out the variety of colors.

The program of events was: be- ‘
ginning strokes drill, advanced

Airplane Crash No Easy Task L

moment has been worked out, and
several for making sounds of wind,
rain, surf, thunder and airplane
motors

Since each kind of noise requires
a separate operator, the question
of finding enough room for them
backstage is a pressing one, The
placing of four bunks, a tablc, Sev»
eral chairs, a woodbox large
enough for a girl to hide in, and a
stove that can be realistically
banged around, on a stage 11 feet
deep is also bothering the produo
tion crew, Mr, Johnson stated.

Spring Ca'ge Practice
Will End in Scrimmage
With Tutors Monday

Spring basketball practice for
this year will be concluded Mon:
day afternoon when a combined
squad made up of this year’s fresh-
men and the members of the var-
sity who did not graduate will
'probably travel to Cedar Falls to
engage in a practice scrimmage
with the Iowa state Teachers col-
lege, John C. Truesdale, varsity
coach, announced yesterday

“The affair will be strictly a
practice session,” Truesdale stated,
“and no official will be used, nor
will the session he run off as a
game with regular playing periods.

The combined squad has been
practicing since the end of the
regular season, Truesdalc said,
“Any person who wants to be con-
sidered as a possible candidate for-
next year's varsity squad should
have been out for these practice
sessions," he stated, “Because the
start of the basketball season is
so soon after the end of the foot
ball season, it is necessary for its
to make the candidacy for the var
sity an invitational proposition, in
order that we can get to work lmr
mediately,” he declared.

However, he stated. for those
men who were unable to attend
the practice sessions this spring,
a basketball class running two
days a week will be held next Oct-
ober, in which such players will
have a chance to show their abil-
ity.

speak at Vespers Sunday. Mr.
Mordy is the father of Margaret

Professor Finds Way
to Cut Business Losses

New York—(ACP)~Columbia
university's Prof. Walter Rauten-
strautch, head of the department
of industrial engineering and a
leader of the technocracy move-
ment, has developed a system
which he claims will out about
$5,000,000 a day from the losses
of American business men.

The new system, it is said, would
enable an executive to determine
the profit or loss to be expected
from any sales volume, and the
point at which the business will
break even. It was devised after
analytical studies had been made
of the financial reports of hune
dreds of industries.
