pie who committed the crime

According to Dave Sears, one of thean~
vestigatnrs working on the case, the in-
vestigation is proceeding smoothly. “We
had a lot oi people come forward” with in-
formation. Said Sears. "There's a lot of

_things that come to light in a thing like
this . , Sometimes you don‘t gel your
witnesses until three or four days” after
the crime. One problem Sears mentioned
is that "you don't know what's motivating
them.” so it can be difficult to track down
exactly-who did it.

When caught. the suspects face up to to
years in prison and up to $10,000 fine for
criminal mischief, a Class-C felony.

Speaking about the many rumors cone
cerning who committed the crime, James
Wol'k admits that there are “lots of
suspects out there because people get
angry." He cautioned that "anybody who
has been involved has heard rumors," but

hard enough to print." Dale Hawn said

“just stupid."

when asked about potential changes in
security. Hawn said that, at the present
lime. he does not “leel like it is necessary"
to beef up security. He said that he has
never seen anything else like this vaii-
dalism in the 20 years he has been with the
college. Nevertheless, ilawn plans to
discuss the matter with George Drake and
Waldo Walker in the near future to decide
whether increased security is necessary.
Dave Sears said that the only way that the
college could have prevented such an inci-
dent was “if they had a chain link fence
around everything that they owned — and
you know how that would go over."

Nearly 600 scientists irom throughout
the state are expected to attend the 99th
annual meeting of the Iowa Academy oi

said, "It is a mistake to teach literary
theory beiore the senior year..,you iirsl
need to get literature under your belt,”

In response to the opinions that literary
should not be taught beiore the basic
elements at literature are taught, Cor.
coran said, “contending that there are
‘basic elements' is already a theoretical
position.”

Corcoran emphasized that literary
theory must be made an important part oi
an undergraduate English curriculum and
she cites an English students' Educational
Policy Committee tE.P.C.) oi last year
that demonstrated that many

undergraduate colleges of Grinnell's size
and caliber employ theory in their regular
curriculum.

Yet Connelly disagrees With Corcoran's
assessment of Gl'innell's English Curr
riculum. As for other colleges of Grinnell’s
Size and caliber, he said, "Grinnell is
about the same in terms oi teaching
literary theory."

Department chairman Moore said that
the E.P,C. study "was useful ill drawing
our attention to what can be done.” But.
Moore added that the statistics of the
ERG. study “did not amount to much and
were too spotty" to draw any conclusions.

'Scarlizl and Black:

You had also mentioned earlier the abor~
tion issue. What do you think is going to
happen With it? Why all the sudden “'right»
torlife" movements?

Milford:

I don‘t know. [think that there‘s a sort of
lunatic iringe, getting to be more than a ir-
inge. who are starting to take over in a lot
oi places They are always a great danger.
As tar as abortion, anyone who‘s ever had
one in the bad, old days. which [did once,
when I was about twenty, it was a terrily.
ing experience. .Well i went down to the
East End of London 7 a friend of mine,
who was sort oi a semirwl‘iore, arranged
the thing. She gave me the name of the
abortionist, you see. So I weni there, took a
bus trip, miles away. sort oi down by the
docks, and rang the bell of this rather
creepy house, and a creepier individual
answered it, a woman who was the abor»
tionist

Wasn’t a sign of any sort of Sterilization.
She sort oi dragged out irom her
underclothes drawers some...stufl‘ or
other. And it turned out that the method
was to pump soap up you. i read a while
later that about ninety percent of those
people who’d had the soap pumped up
them died as a Consequence. And she said
7 it was incredibly painful, there was no
sign or an anesthetic obviously or anything
7 she said, “lfyou get sick after this. don’t
calla doctor, because if you should die, I'll
be hanged as a criminal." Well it was most
encouraging.

Scarlet and Black:
What View of abortion does that leave
you with7

Mitford:

Well, in other words that was in the days
when abortion was totally illegal.
Everyone could be prosecutedtne woman

to whom it was done, and the abortionist. It
was incredibly dangerous. Well, of course
it was the same thing here. We had a
friend, a doctor, who knew contacts, and
how you could get abortions. tor people
who really needed them, you know, I mean
people who were desperate And we'd have
to talk in Aesoplan language, it wasn’t too
good. But i remember him saying once, we
called him about somebody we knew, a
young woman who was really going abr
solutely irantic over the thing. in other
words these doctors would have contacts.
who were physicians, who would do it
under sterile and good conditions, so it
wasn't like that awful woman. And he Said,
“Well tell her that if she‘s had the mer-
chandise for more than three months, it
can't be returned.” This was on the phone

despised the whole Communist idea, but
when the SOViet tanks came in, they
welcomed them because they thought that
if the rebellion should succeed - well, you
kliow there was a great deal of speculation
as to what extent the CIA was involved.
There's no point in my getting into that
because i really don't know. But i can only
say that her lMs. Mitford's
mother-in-law's] relatives felt that it could
signal a return to the Hawlhie regime,
which was the White terror, which was a
totally anti-Semitic operation between the
wars, So it's a rather complex thing,
Anyhow, then came the revelations oi
Krushchev. Shortly after that, perhaps a
year later, there was a convention held in
New York of the Communist Party, which
was preceded by a discussion period that

because we all thought they were lapped.
Scal'leLnnd Black:

You've said that after Krushchev made
all the revelations about the Stalin period,
that it was a very discouraging time for
the Communist Part in the United States. I
was wondering it you could talk about that.

Mitiord:

Well I‘ll tell you what happened. First
off, well, there was Hungary, which hap-
pened in i956, that is, the Russians coming
into' Hungary to stop the rebellion. that
was a very My kind oi thing, really, when
you look back at it. For example, my
mother-idlaw. who was Jewish, had a iew
Hungarian-Jewish relations who still lived
in Budapest, And the reason there wre so
few was, most of them had been carted oil
and murdered in the concentration camps.
So anyhow, these people, who were conser-
valives. they hated the Communist
regime, they were businesspeople and the

was unlike anything I've ever experienced
in the Party. In other words, it was a real
ireeiorail, people saying; what they
thought without reierence to the Party
bureaucracy, which was qmte con.
siderable. And it was my own ieeling at the
time that there was a possibility that,
because at those Krushchev revelations,
the American cp would make a eiiort to
become more oi an indigenous American
lcit-wmg party. And i went to the convene
tion full oi those hopes, and in iact the
California delegation seemed to win, and
they agreed with me. i mean they all had
the same feeling. And they seemed to be
winning all the resolutions at the conven-
tion But what actually happened was, that
there was a sort or behindlhc-scenes re.
take over by the old leadership. So none oi
the things we voted for came to pass. So i
got just bored and led up, I mean. it was
more or less a feeling that there was
nothing much to do in the party. I‘d inucii

from page 2

rather be in other movements. The thing
that was so attractive about the CF was its
firm stand on the rights of blacks.,.and
that was what led me to keep going in it tor
a long long time. So. anyhow in 1958. we
decided just to quit But not with any
animosity, just with a ieeling that we had
come to a parting of the ways. i still have
great friends who work for the Communist
press. and there's no quarrel, There were
arguments, but no bitter horrors. Is that
an answer? a
Scarlet lllld Black:

Another thing I wanted to know was how
the trial of Willie McGee affected you.

hiititii-tl: ,

The trial of Willie McGee? Well, to me it
was just another instance of the crassest,
most disgusting kind of racism on the part
oi the people oi Mississippi. Well, of people
in general, really. The whole country was
turning a blind eye to the whole thing, And
We did what we could, that‘s all. Willie
‘McGee was only one instance oi the whole
operation of the Civil Rights Congress. We
had local cases of irame-up that we poured
all our resources into. And some of them
we won, too. So this was just an example.

Scarlet and Black:
What contemporary issues and trends
are you interested in?

Mitford:

Well, one problem after the demise of
the Communist Party 7 I mean it's prac.
tically nothing now 7 the whole leit got in»
credibly iragmenied. as l'm sure you've
noticed. So that it's much more issue by
issue than any political movement. It
doesn't have any spine to it. Or any real
direction or leadership. So what I do.
pragmatically, is to get involved in
whatever local things seem important to
us. For instance, our congressman, Ron
Dellans, from our district, is really one of
the shining lights, perhaps the only one, in
Congress. So the sort of thing We do is sup
port him every tilne tor elCClloli.‘
