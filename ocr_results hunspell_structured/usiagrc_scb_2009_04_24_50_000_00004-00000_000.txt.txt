1n going ro high school in America and then transitiorr
ing to Grinneli, how were the interactions with your peers
insofar as them asking about your past?

I never talked about it. You see at that point there was no
such thing as a Holocaust. nobody used that word, it didn't
come up until much latchvl/c were displaced pcople, survivors
ofthe people, but displaced people, and that's how we wcre rc-
guided and rhar's how we were wrirren up. “The ﬁrst displaccd
family to come to Des IVIoillcs,"Thzlt kind ofsttiff, you know.

So rhcy knew that I came from Europe and they knew that
rhcre was a war and rhey didn't really ask specific questions
but they were very good. 1 was accepted rorally. I was a srrange
rhing, rhc ﬁrst-foreign speaking student in North High. it was
so unusual, you know, but I was well accepted, they went aoiit of
rhe wny ro help me in every way. It was very good.

What did you snrd'y and what acrivitics did you particie
pate in at Grinnell College?

I majored in philosophy. And as a manor of fact my philosor
phv professor and mentor is still lllivu Hes 102 years old Neal
Klausner I just went to visit him yesterday in the afternoon
His mind is so sharp, he remembers me complcrely, and you
know how many years rhar is'
_ Since 1952‘ So that's what I

majored in,

I was really intelL’slcd in
studying philosophy to future
our (hair happened and why it
happened and what were rhe
theories behind it and why did
people acr rhe way rhey did,
just on a different level, rhe

., level I was accepted in in Gcrr
mitny was an emotional level
but here I wanted to know

what the other people think why did it happen, not that I ever
found out the answer to that, but it was a good major for me.

Were you involved in any other acciviries, our. . . .

Oh my God, yes. 1 was in the inrernarional club,I was in
the ORCUS'iit was a dance club, modern dance club, and we
did two concerts a year where we danced on the stage, student
government. As my English got better and better Ijoined more
thin

Iglslad to work a lot so] didn’t have that much timel worked
at the ofﬁce of the Dean of Women answering the phone,l
worked in the dining room as a waitress, I worked breakfast
time in the dining room, putting up the cereal boxes and all of
that, I worked at the librarin had to put in two hours at the
library.

That was the worst, because] couldn use the time to study.
The best workplace was to be in the d mg room because at
that time, those two hours of meal
time in the evening, we were very for-
mal, with white table cloths and all
that, the two hours that nobody stud
ied, it was go-easy, perfect times—you
didn't lose any study time. The time in
the library would have been the time
when I would‘ve studied anyway they did”

You mennoncd that you were
inrerviewed by eirher Slevm spiel-
berg, or others who were working on

“Schindler’s List."

That happened years later, when the Schindler story liter—
ally hit the newspaper, because that’s when I found it. I was
shocked to find out "that was my life."lt took almost 30 years—
it was published in 1982, and we knew the name ofPaul Page.
We knew him from camp. So next time we were in California,
we spoke about how he got Keneally to write the book. And
then Universal Studios took an option on the book, and forced
Spielberg to do the movie.

This was in 1983, right after had released “El," and he
thought he was nor mature enough to do rhc ﬁlm. So he waire
ed for ten years before he started. So ﬁnally the ﬁlm appeared
in 1993, and then from that he used his money to—bccnuse
people kept approaching him while he was filming and telling
him “I've got a story to roll you"—so he thoughr there were an
awful lot of survivors who should have their stories published

”i was really interested in ill/dye
ing philosophy 1‘0 ﬁgure out what
happened and why it happened
and why did people act the way

before rhey died.

So he started the Shonh foundation, with $56 million of
his personal take of proceeds from the movie, and started this
Shoah foundation on his Universal lot in Los Angeles, where
they’d send people out all over the world to interview. He has
52,000 ro 56,000 interviews with people who suffered during
the you in 30 different languages in 50-some odd different
countries and then he took all of that
and employed people to translate them.

For example, the deposition was in
Russian, then it would be translated
into German maybe, and definitely into
English. My interview was in English,
and I’m sure it was translated into Pol-
ish, into German. It was put on a digital
form and all of that is stored in archives
and now they’re sending all ofthesc ar-
chives to universities and learning instir
tutions.

They’ve told mt: that my interview
is at the Free University of Berlin and is in
Frankfurt and they’re sending it to Austrar
lia. Eventually they want to all universities
that will accept it. They have moved now
the whole process, all of the archives, pere
mancntly into the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles.

They no longer do any interviews ofHo—
locaust survivors because most of them died,
or are dying, They’re now concentrating on
Rwanda, doing inrerviews in Rwanda. They
will follow all kinds ofgcnocidc,I think.

Ten years [later] I was called [and askcd] if it was alright
if they would include parts of my interview on the new DVD
of “Schindler's List” that they were going to release and I said
sure, so they asked me to send some pictures and, you know,I
didn‘t know what they were going to do with all of this but so
this happened ten years after the, the tenth anniversary of the
Shoah Foundation and the tenth anniversary of the ﬁrst film.
And then I was invited to the event when they were releasing
it to the public, talking about it to the public and I met Steven
Spielberg and some ofthe other people and all the acrors were
there that were in “Schindler’s List" and Steven Spielberg told
us why he did ir.

He had no inrenrion ofpurring ir on a DVD but there were
so many denicrs of [the] Holocaust, people saying rhar it never
happened, no way that ir could have, they kcpr talking abour six
million Jews but there were actually 11 million people rhar were
cxtctminated because the orhcr five million were gypsics and

children.”

”i never spoke about it. Nobody

homosexuals and feeble minded and you know. A whole bunch
of other people so that’s why he did it, that’s why he put out the
DVD and that’s why he wanted the support of the people who
had survived on the list to speak about it on the backside of the
DVD and he called it, “Voices from the List."

I know you're giving a talk in the JRC 101 today, but have
you often given . ..

Never. This is my first.
Why did you decide to do this now?

I was called by Rebecca [Heller ’11]
and emailed or something and she posed
that question wherherl would be willing to
come.I thought about it, and I'd never done
ir, never, the only time I ever spoke publi-
cally was for the release of the DVD and
rhey asked me to say somerhing,whar1 said
ro Steven Spielberg and that amazingly was what was captured
and appeared in all rhe newspapers.

It was funny, that rhar lirrle bir that I spoke should have
made it because other people spoke and he spoke but, no I’ve
never done it, but I thought that I owed Grinnell something.
Grinnell was very good to me, you know.

Do you think based offofdoing the speech today rhatyou
will eonnnuc co speak about your experiences in the Holo-
must?

I don’t know . . . It’s very interesting,l never spoke about it.
Nobody in my community knew that I was a Holocaust survir
vor, not in school, not anywhere not even my children, not until
my son was 14 and my daughter was 11. So where I live now in
Southern California, we moved there about 15 years ago, I have

' a little granddaughter who is graduating from high school and

you see how quickly the years progress.
And some ofthe people have heard, you know, because they
saw my name prinred in rhe LA. Times so they’ve asked me
and I haven't considered ir because it's differenr speaking here,
you know people are receptive, they've asked me for it and eye
erything and speaking to people who might have’ncvcr seen
“Schindler’s List". . .1 only starred talking about my experienc-
es after “Schindler's List" came out becausc there was a point of
referencc.I could say "have you seen it?" so I don't know,l really
don't know, I'll see how things go today and we’ll find out.
