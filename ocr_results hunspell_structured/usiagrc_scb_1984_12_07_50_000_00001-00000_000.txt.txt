A Biased Editorial

This edition of the Scarlet and Black is the first of two
transition issues in which the first semester staff will be
passing the baton to the new second semester staff.

The incoming Editorrianhief will be Robert Quashie,
who has served as News Editor this semester and was
Sports Editor last semester.

The new News Editor, filling Robert’s position, is Scott
Hildula, who has written for the 5&8 for several
semesters and has also worked at the Grinnell Herald-
Register. We expect Scott will do an excellent job as
News Editor.

Features Editor for next semester is Flora Winitz. a
junior transfer and experienced writer/editor, replacing
Jane Kaufman, who did a superb job this semester.

Sports Editior for next semester will be Eric Whit-
taker, an experienced athlete/writer who will be replac-
ing Terri Porter. who must be commended for nearly
singlehandedly writing and editing the Sports page this
semester.

As the new Entertainment Editor, Kate Worster, who
among other things has written excellent Hitchcock film
reviews this semester, will be filling the position present
ly occupied by the irreplaceable Barry Edwards. Barry
has put his blood. sweat and tears into the 5&3 this
semester. Barry has put his life on the line for the 58:3
The 5&8 will surely miss Barry next semester, not just
because of his great one-world headlines (“Play”,
“Movie”, “Concert”, “Dance”, “Fudge", etc), but
because he’s a great guy and fun to pick on. Barry will be
spending next semester in India.

Ad manager will be Sanjay Khanna. who has Worked in
advertising on the New Delhi Times in India. Advertising
manager this semester has been Angela Wade who is a
junior from Chicago. .

Circulation manager Arthur Tinkelenberg will con-
tinue in his position. Arthur. a freshman, has been in
charge of 8&1; subscriptions and mailing, and has done a
remarkable job. having had no experience. and no help.

Lastly. Ben Armstrong will be joining current Photo
Editor Paul Hinson in working as co-photo editors next
semester.

Special thanks to all who have written for and cone
trtbutea‘ to the 8&8 this semester. and thanks to those of
you who have given positive and negative criticism
throughout the semester. ,

Looking forward to '85. Lameduck E-i-C. Owen Charles
