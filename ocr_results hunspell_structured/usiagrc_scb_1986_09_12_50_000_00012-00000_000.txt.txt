Brown from page '7
a reputable magazine which was
distributed nation-wide. Grinnell‘s fate
was sealed.

Gl‘orge Drake. as I see matters, realized
his error, but it was too late; the damage
had been done, People began to recognize
the name “Gl'innell.” The number of app
plicants increased tremendously. Tuition
increased tremendously. And. as 1 im-
aglne, George Drake never .iorgave
himself (or the phone call he never made.

How can this fateful leap into inobscurlr
ty ever be corrected?

The solution, it seems. has been to pay
someone lots of money to come up with a
logo which Grinnell students and pro-
fessors alike can detest, and which can be
easily misinterpreted. My first reaction to
the figure in the bar of the new logo {a
remnant, I understand, from the laurel
leaves of the old logol, was that it depicted
a pair of mating slugs. A more popular in»
lerpretation seems to be “lips," Not only
will this logo make anyone assoclated with
the school want to keep it anonymous, but
it also will make potential students shy
away irom Grinnell After all, would you
Want to go to ”Grinnelerhe College of
Lips," or worse yet, to ”Grinnell»The Col»
lege ol the Mating Slugs?"

Who says the administration is
unresponsive to students wishes? George
Drake. I like to think, has been very
responsive to my wishes. “Well heck!” I
imagine him saying. “Babs is down in the
dumps because Grinnell is becoming well-
known. And, gosh, this upsets me, too. My
pals and I will have to do something to fix
this — PRONTO! ” This is what I imagine
lead George Drake to his decision tn ac~
cept Grinnell's new logo.

from page 7

As it turned out, i played football {or
nine years, including three at the college
level. For me, lootball has been an incredi»
ble experience that has meant more than
words can describe. I'm not playing this
year because I decided it was time to play
liie . . . which brings me back to what
started out as the topic of this week’s col-
umn (although you'll never know that
because I'll edit that part out).

What I find most amazing, alter all ol
this rambling, is the miracle of the human
brain. Nothing in the world can periorm a
thought process like i have just illustrated
to you, but our brains coiistnntiy do it mid
other spectacular things throughout our
iiletiuies.

impression this year's freshmen gathered

,about how the college handles and

allocates money. Theo Eicher
