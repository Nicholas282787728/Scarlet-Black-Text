jol'ity ill tlle six cottages, the stu-
dent referendum relative to plaea
illg the Cyclone on the Semester
fee was passed by the student
body Thursday night. The com-
plete count of the ballots showed
a majority of 373 to 1 2.

.That the power 0)". swinging the

ell is shown by the count on Votes
outside the cottages. The 258
votes cast outside were equally
divided, 129 for the proposition

and 129 against.
Quarter Fail to V008

Votes in favor of the proposition
total 71 per cent of the total votes
cast and 54 per cent of the entire
student body. Almost a quarter of
the Grinnell college student body did
not vote on the question.

The referendum was taken to the
students by the student council and
now must pass both the faculty and
the trustees before the Cyclone is
made-compulsory. The faculty will
probably act on the question at its

‘ regular meeting Monday.
Climnxed Discussion

The dormitory vote was 115 in
favor of the compulsory Cyclone and
104 against. Only 39 of 31 town
womcn voted, the ballot standing at

, 14 in favor and 25 against.

The vote climaxed a discussion fol-
lowing the Wednesday issue of The
Scarlet and Black which endeavored
to glve both sides of the question in
front page editorials and attacked
the plan in its editorial columns.

Pamphlet Rothllafes

Backers of the plan rcbaliatcd
Thursday evening before the vote
with a pamphlct in which several
student leaders were quoted as being
in favor of the plan.

The closeness of voting outside of
the quadrangle shows the sentiment
of many students on the Subject.
There was never any doubt as to the
result of the Vote of the quadrangle
organization although the decisive
majority there was a surprise to
many, .
