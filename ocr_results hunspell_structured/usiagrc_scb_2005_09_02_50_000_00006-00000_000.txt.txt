He shares the apartment with his

some movies at the Strand Theater
soon." Kennedy hails from Clevee
land, Ohio, where he attended Hie
ram College and received his undcr-
graduate degree in political science.
He later obtained his master-’5 in
Higher Education and Recreation Education from

When Kennedy decided to work in residence life,
he thought about his time at Hiram and SIUC.

Kennedy said he liked the atmosphere at Hiram,
a school of about 900 students better than at SIUC, a

As an undergraduate student,
Kennedy did not imagine he would
be working at a college years later.
Rather, he hoped to be a politician
and had an internship with Repub-
llcan Senator George Voiriovich from Ohio, “I'm a
Democrat, though," Kennedy said.

After his thrcc year tenure at Grinnell, Kennedy
said he would like to stay involved in higher educae
tion and hopcs to serve as the director ofa college
recreation center.

There for students, socially conscious

Chuck Erickson may be new to Jar
MaLand and Grinnell College, but his
apartment in Main is already a gather
ing place for students. In one haltihour,
one student stops by to borrow the
movie Nrwlx'ﬂ, another to lounge on a
couch and bounce a ball off the office
wall. Several more come begging for
food or toys from the stash Erickson
keeps on hand.

The stream of students in and out
ofEticksonls office is in line with his “as
approachable as possible" philosophy
toward being a Residence Life coor-
dinator.“l’m not here to be the police."
Erickson stressed his role as the gotto
person for roommate, personal issues

and academic advice.

Erickson is well aquantcd with aca-
dcmia. He grew up in Iron Mountain,
Mich. and attended Lawrence College
in Wise, where he earned bachelor’s
degrees in Spanish and Music Educae
tron. He completed his master’s degree
in higher education and student affairs
ar Iowa State University But he is nor
tircd of collcgc life yet.

“My type of personality is that I
like to be involved with students,” he
said. He said he enjoys the variety of
experiences that come with working as
an RLC and prefers the unexpectedness
of residence life to the predictability of
a more conventional job.

Before coming to Grinnell, Ericle
son worked as a Boys and Girls’ Club

Gay-Leshian-Biscxual—Transgcnder
(GLBT) counselor. He counseled teens
who were often dealing with abusive
parents and the typical rigors oladolese
cence as well as sexual identity issues.

“There was a lot ofcrying in my or
free," he said. Erickson became a GLBT
activist after realizing the “unbelievable
incquality" that GLBT citizens face in
society, such as not being able to have
their partners legally recognized,

He will serve as the director of the
Stonewall Resource Center. For Err
ickson, “there’s no separation” between
his job and his activism. He plans to
be a resource for Grinnell’s socially
conscious community “I think that's
part ofthe reason Grinnell Wanted me
here," he said.

Loving the uniqueness of being an RLC

Bv RACHEL FIELDS

For some, life is focused around a
sense ofsecurity. For others, the lack of
complete structure is what makes life
exciting—and therefore, ﬁercely enjoy-
able.

For Kimberly HindstBrush, the
new RLC for Hairles, Read and Loose
Halls, the unpredictability of life is are
tructivc, Since her marriage to her huse
band Randy in October 2004, I-linds—
Brush has experienced a major life
change: a move from the busy, bustling
Las Vegas and a job as an accountant to
a small college in central Iowa. “For the
first time in my life." she said, “I don't
have a aveeyear plan."

Hindsehrush grew up in sacrae
mento, California, and later attended

the University of Nevada in Las Vegas
(UNLV), where she earned bachelors
degrees in history and accounting.
Later, she went on to acquire a master’s
in educational leadership from UNLV,
working as a graduate assistant career
counselor while she continued her edu-
cation.

“When I realized that I loved be
ing on campus and in that supportive
atmosphere, I looked into howl could
work on a college campus," she said. “I
went to a large school, so I wanretl to
experience a smaller school."

Along with her husband, Hinds-
Brush lives with her husband and two
cats, Spike and Samantha. “Books and
movies are big in our house,” she said,
though she admitted that their collect

tron of music is “more of [her] huse
band’s thing.”

In addition to working with her
student staff, HilldS’Bl’USll is interested
in the international student organizer
tion (150). At UNLV. she worked as a
career counselor for international stun
dents,reviewing their resumes and pres
paring them for interviews; continuing
her work at Grinnell therefore seems
incredibly natural

With the start of the new school
year, HindseBrush is busy but looks for
ward to the coming weeks, particularly
the ISO food bazaar and future study
bleaks. She is curious about campus
culture, though she has her pet peeves.

“Don’t smoke in my buildings," she
said. “You can smell it evcrywhcre.”
