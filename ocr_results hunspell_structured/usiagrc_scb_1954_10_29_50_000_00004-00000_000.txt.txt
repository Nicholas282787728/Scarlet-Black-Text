Smith, Dib leS
EM football Tille

As intramural football play
goes into its final week of play,
Smith and Dibble are virtually
deadlocked for first place. Smith
has won 90%|of their games to
lead in that category while Dib-
ble holds a one game margin.

In last week’s games, Dibble
tipped Gates 130 while Smith
was idle, Cowles edged South
12-6, and the Southmen also
dropped a close one to Langan
7-6. Rawsol-l forfeited to Gates,
.and according to intramural di—
rector John Truesdale it was the
first forfeited game in 35 years
of lM football.
