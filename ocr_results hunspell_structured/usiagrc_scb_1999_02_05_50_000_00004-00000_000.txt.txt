4 SPORTS

The Corenr Fldg

A

sport Grinnell does not

have, but sorely needs

BY CHRIS DIETRICH

It was just the beginning ofa new year.
The ﬁrst Monday of a new year, in fact. To
be more speciﬁc, it was Monday, January
4, 1999. At 8:30 PM on that day, my life
changed drastically.

Why? Iwent to the ﬁrst wrestling event
of my lifetime. Now, I'm not talking about
the kind of Wrestling 125 pound Weak»
lings commit themselves to in high school
and college. I'm talking about REAL wres-
tling.

On that liferaltering night, I first expe
rienced WCW Monday Nitro at the Gear
gia Dome inAtlanta. This sport, and I say
sport because it truly is one, is absoIUtely
awe inspiring. As the ﬁrst match began,l
felt asAhab must have when he ﬁrst spot-
ted the great White Whale.

Diamond Dallas Page Walked from
backstage,and has he made his way down
to the ring, he stopped, threw his hands
up in the air, and the ﬁreworks exploded
behind him,antl the crowd noise Was deaf-
ening It was amazing.

And at that moment.l knew, from the
innermost workings of my heart.that this
sport is exactly what Grinnell College
needs.

World Championship Wrestling may be
down-played by some ignorants as super-
ﬁcial and fake, but those who can see with
their eyes open know it is so much more
than that. it is a morality play, a micro
cosm ofour existence,the existence ofall
humanity,

To give an example ofrhe many truths
that could be discovered by erecting a
steel cage in Darby Gymnasillm,l will re-
count the main events of the night

The entire night was leading up to a
World Heavyweight Championship
rematch with Kevin Nash of the New

Jockstn

World Order (NWO), the angsty offspring
of the WCW, defending his title against
Goldberg (a former pro football player for
the Atlanta Falcons), the previous cham-
pion. But, about halfway through the
night, Nash’s friend, Miss Elizabeth, in
formed Atlanta policemen that Goldberg
had been stalking her. So, dangerously
close to the championship bet, they ar-
rest Goldberg.

In the meantime, Hollywood Hulk
Hogan (running for President in 2000),has
challenged his fellow NWO pack member
Nash to a duel for the belt since, some-
how, Goldberg hasn’t sho'wn up yet. Co-
incidentally, Goldberg won the belt from
Hogan before losing it to Nash. So, as Nash
and Hogan begin to face off, the police
realize that Miss Elizabeth has been lying,
and they let Goldberg go. A free man
again, Goldberg rushes to the ring to win
back what is rightly his from Nash

But,to his dismay, he ﬁnds that I-Iogan
has already fought Nash, and Nash has put-
posely taken a dive to let Hogan have the
belt back. lnfuriated,Goldberg dives into
the rlng,only to be handcuffed to the rope,
burned with an electric cattle prod, and
spray painted upon. '

Lies. Betrayal. Revenge.

In what other sport, nay, in what other
event, will you find such an epic battle
between good and evil. This sport,and all
that is represents, mirrors life. It is our
being incarnate, Now, if getting to see
what life is all about is not horizon-broad
ening, I do not know what is

So,all you sports fans otlt there,I urge
you to petition the necessary bodies of
our school to bring the WCW into our
own backyard.

Scarlet and Black. Hi, Mike. First, can
you give us a little background about your
self.

Mike: i grew up in Colorado Springs.
My dad's a professor at Colorado College.
which is a really stmllilr institution to
Grinnell, so 1 land of grew up in a setting
very similar to this. I always played sports
when I was little—everything from soc-
cer to basketball to tennis to lacrosse Sol
grew tip playing sports. I played a Sport

every season in high school. basketball
was my main focus, but I played baseball
as wellAcadcmics are important to me,
so that's why I ended tip in GrinnellJ also
liked the opportunity to play basketball,
so that's wlly i ended up here.That's how
I grew up.

Soil]: Ilow did you tlecitlc [0 come to
Grinnell?

Mike, I applied to a hunch of schools
that I thought we Atlicully very
good, like Williams lntl Grinnell Then I
came for my visit,itnd I really enjoyed my
visit here much more than anywhere else.
I really liked the basketball team and I
knew lrom talking to (Ioilch Arsencatllt
that 1 could play basketball here right away
as a freshmanithztt w: importantTliey
had the right combination orathlelits and
acittlemlcs.so llmt's why I ended up here,

With three weeks remaining in the sea-
son,the Grinnell College men's basketball
team hopes to ﬁnd success and parlay it
into a Winning season and another NCAA
Division III scoring title

The Pioneers have five games remain-
ing, including three at home.This Friday
Ripon comes to town for a 5:00 o'clock
afiair and then next Wednesday
Monmouth is scheduled for 5:00.

"We have seen both Monmouth and
Ripon and they are talented. Couple it
with the fact that both are in the hunt for
a Midwest Conference playoff berth, and
we should have tough games. Over the
last five years,though,we have played very
well against both opponents at home,"
commented Coach David Arseneault.

Currently second-place Ripon has a 7-
2 league record and is scheduled to square
off Wlihﬁi’strplace St. Norbert on'I\iesday.
Monmouth is in fourth place with a 7-4

Scarlet 8 Black 0 Friday, February 5

Men’s basketball to face
talented Ripon ioddy

markThe top four loop teams face offin a
four-team championship tournament at the
end of the season,

last weekend the Pioneers fell twice
on the road leaving them at 4-7 in the con-
ference and 8-9 overall. On Friday St.
Norbert prevailed, 119-95. and Saturday
Lawrence won, 113-83.

In both games the host raced out to
doubleedigit halftime leads and the PiOr
neers were forced to Climb back during
the second half. Poor ﬁeld goal shooting,
36% against St. Norbert and 28% against
Lawrence, had a drastic effect on the game.

“When you go on the road against two
of the better teams in the conference,you
have to do almost everything correctly to
have a chance to win.We didn't, and the
end result was not good," offered
Arseneault.

At St. Norbert, the typical trio of scor-
ets led the Pioneers.Jeff Clement netted

28 points while forwards Mike Hochman
and Woody Fiil'to added 24 and 18. Cody
Skarning, Bmd Ruhoff and Jason Anderson
all posted four assists apieceHochmari led
the squad with six rebounds.

Against lawrence I-Iochman netted 16
points and grabbed eight rebounds while
Clement added 18 points and six steals.
Runoff led the team with ﬁve assists.

The Pioneers are currently leading
NCAA Division III in scoring and three-
point makes with averages of 117.1 points
and 20.1 three-pointers a game. With a
33.5 points per game average,Clement is
nearly four points a game ahead of sec-
ond-place Devean George from Augsburg,
who is averaging 29.6. Clement also leads
the nation in three-point makes with 7.4
per contest.

Piirto ranks second nationally With 5.1
threepointers a game.

Women’s basketball focusing on

successes

The monotony of back-to-back games
will be broken for the Grinnell College
women's basketball team this weekend.
After four weeks of FridayrSaturday con-
ference match-ups, the Pioneers are look
ing forward to a week where only one
game will be played. Grinnell hosts Ripon
this Friday for a 7:00 tip-off.

"We've been struggling to put together
two halves of good ball," said Coach Jenny
Wood, "Friday’s game against Ripon will
provide us another opportunity without
having to ‘savc' anything for a next game.
Our focus will be on playing offense and
defense well for the full forty minutes."

Last Weekend the Pioneers suffered
road losses to St. Norbert and Lawrence.
At St.Norbert, the Knights jumped out to
a 60 lead before Mandi Hill hit a 3-point
bucket to bring Grinnell into the game six

minutes into the half.

St. Norbert maintained their lead by as
many as seven points and as few as three
points during the next ten minutes. But in
the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of the ﬁrst half the
Knights outscored the Pioneers, 1 1-2, and
took a 38:19 halftime lead.

In the second period, St. Norbert con-
tinued to stretch its lead and evcntuallyran
away with a 7039 victory.

Hill led Grinnell with 14 points and ten
rebounds. Sara Veit added ten points and
Amy Waiters had nine.

"When you can't get the wins, you start
to focus on the other successes your team
has. Last Friday it was the play of Katie
Hanck and Sam Veit that impressed me,"
said Coach Wood. "Katie was on their top
perimeter player and she played excellent
defense. Sal-a continues to show more ag-

gression towards the basket and that paid
off with increased opportunities at the
free throw line."

In Saturday’s game at Lawrence the Pio
neers again came out slowly. Shooting a
sparse 19% in the ﬁrst period. Grinnell
found itself down. 54—18, at halftime. De-
spite a more evenly played second stanza,
the Pioneers were unable to overcome the
ﬁrst-half deﬁcit and Lawrence went on to
win, 725 3.

The Pioneers had four players score
in double digits.I-Iill and Jessica Halverson
each had 14 points, while Walters added
13 andVeit had 10.Wood again recognized
the strong defensive play of Katie Hanck.

"The second halfagainst lawrence was
a good example of us playing 20 minutes
of team bail,“ commented the coach."0ur
focus heading into this weekend’s game
is to extend that to the full forty minutes."

 

 

 

 

SUPPORT YOUR MEN’S AND
WOMEN’ S BASKETBALL
TEAMS TONIGHT AT

FIVE AND SEVEN

 

 

8&5: Let’s talk a little bit about the has
ketball team here at Grinnell.

Mike:The team here at Grinnell—it’s a
pretty neat experience.We do a system of
basketball that's completely different than
anywhere else.It's really neat because one,
it gives the opportunity for people to play

that Wouldn’t be able to play in any other‘

system and it gives people the opportu-
nity to play lots of minutes that they
Wouldn't normally. We get recognition.
Grinnell basketball is known across the
country for doing some very unusual and
unique things. I think it's really neat be-
cause I may have a Grinnell sweatshirt
on..,and someone might talk about the
basketball team anywhere. Especially in
Colorado, people know about it.That’s re-
ally neat and exciting that a small (NCAA)
Division III program gets that much atten-
tion and that mtlch notice.

ssda: What is it like to be pan ofa team
like Grinnell’s?

Mike: It‘s—I can't even explain it to you,
It’s the best feeling.That group of guys is
really my best friends, I’m sure I would
have a really different experience at
Grinnell ifl wasn’t on the team. I don't
know if it would be as good because I’ve
made some really tight bonds with the
guysThat’s really important to me because
that's my close bunch of friends.Wt: have
to share going through the trials of a scab
son I really don't think a lot of Grinnell
students understand what it’s like to be on
a team You're forcing yourself to go
through some pretty tough times, like
physically going through the stress of
gamcs. It makes [the team] a lot closer,
which is what I really like.Thc guys are
outstanding, and it's fun to play sports.

ssdi- How has this season been going?

Mike: The year’s been up and down.
We ‘ve had our montents,but it's been fairly
disappointing because we should be bet-
ter than our record shows at 8-9.We just
really haven't played up to our potentiall

think we’re probably more talented than
any team in the league, yet one game we
just don't put out the effort or one game
our shots don’t fall or one game we're just
a step too slow.When we get it all right,
we win.But it's been kind oflike one part‘s
always missing every game.Aiso, we’re re-
ally young.. .so next year I think we'll be
even better and we'll continually improve.

5&3: When you’re not playing basket-
ball,what do you like to do here?

Mike: I think I spend too much time
studying. For the most part, I really just
hang out with my friends, watch'l'.V,,watch
a lot of movies,maybe go to what the cam-
pus has to offer like plays and lectures.But
just generally hang around campus—I
don‘t usually get out of Grinnell too much.
I‘m pretty laid back and don't do a whole
lot of anything other than basketball and
studying,..

5&3: What’s your major?

Mike:I haven’t actually declared, but I’m
most likely going to be an economics/p0
litical science double major.

5&3: How did you get into that?

Mike: I always had a really strong inter-
est in politics, so the political science as
pect was pretty easyl just naturally gravi-

lek: .leI Baller Mike Hochman

tated toward that.l had Intro to Econ and
I had another econ course and it really.
clicked with me—I really started to like
it. Plus.a lot of the basketball guys are econ
majors, so talking to them moved me to
wards that ﬁeld. i really enjoy it now, and
I’m sure I want to do something combin-
ing those two majors.

8&3: Greath there anything else you
want to add?

Mike: I'd just like to add that I think
Division III sports are really importantJ
think we’re truly where the student ath-
lete lies. I’m pretty pessimistic about Dir
vision I sports. I think most of those guys
aren't really students and the few that
are—I’m sorry, but I think I can pretty
much safely make that generalization. Di-
vision III sports are truly a great thing
because we're Students and athletes!
think that may be a little misunderstood
on this campus] like this section, Jocks
Can Talk; I think it proves that we're not
just dumb guys that are here to play sports,
I don't think it’s that way with any Grinnell
athlete. I just want people to understand
that the athletes here are a lot more than
just able-bodied athletes—I think they're
a lot more than that.
