The beginning of the game went
slowly and many fouls were made
as the Smith men tried to accuse
tom themselves to women's rules.

Paul Boat, junior, was con-
tinuously called for steps. Bill
Plass gently bumped into Lorna
McCleary and immediately turned
around expecting to find her flat
on her race.

Throughout the game, however,
until the last quarter, the score
was evenly matched. At the half
it was tied it to s. and at the start
of the second half, Haines forged
ahead and the score became 11 to
a. At that point Smith put on the
heat and ended the game in a
hlaae of glory, winning 25y, to
16.

The men had to Sink a terrific
number of baskets to arrive at
their Score as only 1/. of a point
was granted for each basket made
by a varsity man

Outstanding players for Haines
were Dorothy Ackerman, Betty
“Butch" Young, Vivian Blanding,
and Jane Huntoon The girls,
thriving on conditioning exercises,
put their hearts into the game and
fought gallantly for their team,

Proceeds from the game amount
ed to $23.95, according to Harold
Goplerud, president of the Counr
oil of House Presidents, and they
will go into the War chest.

The game was a success only
because of the cooperation of the
participants and the spectators.
“I want to thank everyone for
their support," George Bishop,
Smith president, said.

policy of presenting a prominent
soloist at each performance.

Phelps Buys Basic

Canned Goods
For Nex’r Year

Shortage of canned goods at the
college has been averted by pur-
chase of all basic canned goods
for next year, Doctor Samuel N.
Stevens announced today.

Last Saturday the final dispos-
itions werc Signed after a long
search tor the goods, Fancy
foods have not been purchased
because they are not available,
but the canned goods purchased
have cost 15 to 20 per cent over
last year’s prices, he said.

Louis V. Phelps, college Lreas»
urer, found it necessary to extend
the search for food and purchass
ed goods to four wholesale hous-
cs instead of two or thrcc, Stev-
cns said. .

Meat will have to be purchased
as needed, since college refrigera.
tion facihtes are limited. Milk,
butter, and eggs are provided by
the college farm, Stevens stated,
and the war situation will not ef—
fect these supplies.

Depression Bill—

$700 Tui’rion Loan

Louis v. Phelps, college treasurer,
felt recently that “some of the
seed sown can grow and produce
fruit" when a $700 tuition loan
extended from the depression days
was paid.

The man who repaid the bill had
found it necessary to work as a
janitor and waiter, in addition to
borrowing money. in order to get
through Grinnell. He wanted to
attend law school, Phelps said,
after being graduated from here,
and he was given permission to
go before paying his bill.

After his graduation he saved
all he could from his beginning
practice, and recently he paid the
principal of his notes. Later,
Phelps relates, he decided he
wasn’t satisfied, and of his own
free will he offered to pay the
interest although he Wasn't oli-
ligated to.

Recen’rly Repaid
—Repaid By Alumnus

He told me when he paid this
additional money that he was go-
ing to join the army, Phelps said.
When asked why, he answered.
“Any state that could do as much
for a young man as this state de-
serves all the help I can give her
in time of stress."
