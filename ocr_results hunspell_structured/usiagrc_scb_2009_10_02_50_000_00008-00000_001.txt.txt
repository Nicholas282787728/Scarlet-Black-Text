av SYDNEY DEVINE RAUSCH AND Raneccn PARK

“Molecules that Matter"opencd at the Faulconer Gale
lety Sept.25,marking the 10th anniversary ofthe Bucks
bautn establishment. As an integral part ofthe Grinnell
community the Falconer Gallery brings new arts,cultures
and ideas onto campus every year. For the past decade,
Lesley Wright,Director ofthc Gallery, has conducted the
organization ofcxhibits and related activities,

Excellent management and student participation
continues to bring exciting new exhibits like this one to
our campus. At the 383 Magazine we had the oppor»
tunity to meet with Wright. Here, we present you with
the inner workings of the Fauleorter Gallery and what
students can do to help out.

Rebecca Park: Could you tell me a bit about the
history of the Gallery)

Lesley Wright: It’s my understanding that prior to
10 years ago, we had a couple of places for displaying
art. There was the Print and Drawing Study Room in
the [Burling] Library, which was built in the 80s, and
that’s where the Collection did most of its exhibitions
and presented contemporary traveling shows.

There was a corridor gallery that ran down the cor-
tidot that the Art Department used to do little shows.
Literally, it was a corridor that you walked through. And
then there was something called the Terrace Gallery,
which is where the Health Center is now, that students
used as their gallery space. So that’s what there was 10
years ago [1999], before Faulconer.

And as the trustees put together a committee to
develop this building [Bucksbaum], they had administrate
tors, had trustees and they had members ofthe three ﬁne
arts departments, who all traveled around other colleges
and looked at their ﬁne arts buildings. And they decided
they really wanted a space that had facilities for the three
departments but also a kind of a gallery that could do
bigger shows than they had been able to do. So that was

 

the beginning and that was the charge that was given to
Cesar Pelli, to design a building that could accommodate
theater, art history, studio art, music, dancemnd have some
kind otindependent gallery space.

RP; And you ﬁnd that's adequate for the Gallery and
its size and what you want to do here?

LW: 1 don't think there's a museum director in the
country who wouldn't say they want more staff. We‘ve
talked about it."[hetc's a couple otthings we'd love to have,
A Registrar, a person who really is the recordekccper for
the Gallery and who also is the shipping expert, because
we all participate in all of that and it would be nice to
have one expert, who's just like our librarian who could
keep track ofeverytl)ing.That would be an ideal position
to have, We would like somebody to help Milton [5:7
vere '87, Director of Exhibition Design] with preparing
works, but we do what we can with students or the rest
of us helping out. And we‘d love to have a support staff
person, you know, we donr have a secretary of any ldnd
to plan all our events and do all out correspondence and
all that kind ofstuff.

RP: You're totally independent from the Art Depart-
ment. '

LW: Completely. We are an administrative depart
ment, we are not an academic depaltment, which is an
important distinction. Not that we don't collaborate a lot
with all the departments in this building and with other
departments on campus,

I'm on a lot of faculty committees across campus, but
I'm also on administmtive committeeslt’s actually turned
our to be really good for us to have contact in both those
areas because it gives us a base ofknowledge we wouldn't
have had otherwise,

It's been great for me to teach. I think it really helps
me understand the institution better, to really know the

students.
RP. How involved are students in the gallery‘

LW: We use students in a variety ofwalys.We always
lure students to be at the desk in the Gallery. so they'te
kind of our tronr lme, they're the people that greet the
public, they're the face otthe Gallery in many ways.

Kay [\Vilson, Curator of the Collection] hires a lot
or students to work in the Print and Drawing Study
Room, helping her pull work, to get things photographed
digitally to add up to the database and to install the
exhibitions over tliere.Tliey also get involved sometimes
with cutting mats and doing some simple framing. And
then we have since about 2005, we have always had an
intern, every fall and spring.

But we also always have students who are working
with us in the summer, and often it's at least two who
are here in the summer with us. And we regilarly hire
a student clerk,

We're always thinking of new ways we can ﬁnd to
use students.

RP: You mentioned the Burling Gallery and Print
and Drawing Study Room. How involved is Faulconet
in other exhibition spaces like that?

LW: Burllng Gallery is under our control, so that is
a spacewe’re unusual in that were one department but
we're in two dliterent buildings, as our spaces. So Kay
works for me, it’s part ofFaulconer Gallery And over
the years we’ve started to kind ofbranch out, ﬁnd other
spaces. So we also do the exhibitions that are in the lower
level ofthejolin Chrystal Center, and some years that‘s a
more active space than others, it's been fairly static now
for about a year.

We helped with the commission ofart in Rose Hall

a number ofyears ago. We brought in an artist who did ‘

an installation in Noyce last year, a temporary exhibition.
