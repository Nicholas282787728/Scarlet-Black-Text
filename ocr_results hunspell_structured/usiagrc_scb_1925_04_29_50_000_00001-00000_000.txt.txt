The Pioneers journey to Lincoln
Saturday for a dual mar-t with the
Cornhuskers. The rural tryouts for
the men to make the trip a bei "
held this week. The scrim will prob-

ably leave Friday. _

That Nebraska has a formidable nr-
ray of stars, is not to be doubted. In
Wier. husky hurdler and Look their
dash man who stepped the century in
:9 sub last Saturday. they have two
men who can collect points, They
have a quarter mile relay team which
undoubtedly would have set a iiew
world's mark last week had they not
had the misfortune to drop the baton
in the final stretch. These men are
all sprinters of ability and will be
used to good effect Saturday.

What the out come of the mile re-
lay will be is only for speculation.
Nebraska has beaten Grinnell once
and the Pioneers succeeded in nosing
out the Oornbuskers once before. in
the ﬁeld events the Scarlet and Black
team seems to have a little of the ads

’ vantage. however. With Rillet‘ort and
Meeter to heave the shot and discus

' and juvelin. and possibly Moi-tin in the
discus and shot. the Pioneers should
take a good many points. The Husk—
ers are a little lacking in distance
men also and Meyer and Gould should
have a chance to garner counters for
Gi-lnnell in the nrile and two mile
runs.

The same mile relay that has been

”running; . Schernweber. ,M‘; ' .
Kitchen and Taylor will probably pass
the baton in the duel as well as being
entered in various other events, Tay-
lor and Green will run both hurdles,
and Seharnweber arid Kitchen will
probably riiu the quarter mile race.
Taylor may broad jump and high jump
as well as run the 220 yard sprint
with either Scharnweber or L. Jones
for a running mate.

Gould and probably Breitenbach will
run the mile and King and Stotts or
Patton are to rim the half mile. Meyer
and probably Alhitley or Woodruff
will run the two mile.

The hundred will probably see L
Jones and Schai-nii-cber contending
with the Huskers for honors In the
pole vault Sclioenaiuau is the only
likely candidate.

Grinnell and Nelilaslfn clashed
duals several years but outside or the
large relay meets and the valley con»
ference meet this win her the fir-st
actual clash between the two teams
for a; long while. Nebraska has been

in

strong in track and has been \ii soriri .

valley champion for four , al's. The
Pioneers seem to be on a par with the
Huskers this year. however, and the
dual meet ought to be one of the rust-
est held in the we. . for Taylor, Wcir,
Lock and Rineroi-t ure tour of the
best track men ill the country.

power. the guild is sponsoring a
school of the theater. Both Winthrop

of the faculty.

Mrs. Flanagan was likewise interest-

drama, "The Green Hat." which seem~

than a reading of the play would lead
one to believe. As interpreted by Ara

The tennis season will be officially
opened tomorrow when the Pioneer
squad clashes with the Ames team on
the local country club courts. The
meet will begin at onerfifteell.

Paul Bennett has been priming his
men to meet the Aggies and from an
advance dope he ought to start the
schedule with a win. Iowa state lost
her veterans Paige and Young and al-
thcugh her new material may sur-
prise the Ploncers it will be untried.

Nicolct and Brody who will play for
Grinnell have had a year of varsity
experience in addition to tournament
play during the summer so they can
be classed as veterans. West Stotts
will commence his .l :St year of inter-

collegiate play but .be has been up

against some of the best men of the
state so he ought to stand fire against
the Aggies. . Floyd Jones will prob-
ably be the fourth member of the
quartet. Halsey and Moore have
been ranking near the top during the
tournament tryout but they are
eligible to play against Ames. so Jones
will get an opportunity.

The schedule for the season is
probably incomplete as there has
been an attempt to get some more
dunl meets. As it now stands. the
schedule is:

The Grinnell Men's Glee Club will
grie its thir -f St‘nnhual home con—
cert in Her-i k chapel next Friday
night at eight o'clock. According to
David E Peck, director. this year's
program will be more pretentious
than any ever presented by a Grinnell
cliib before.

The numbers which have been Cho—
sen for this occasion are varied and
difficult. though not spectacular. Be-
lieving that whatever success the club
has attained in the past has been
through the sacrifice of the individual
for the betterment of the ensmble, Mr.
Peck has so arranged the program
that the club as a whole will have
little rest. It is true that there are a
few solos. yet the club as a whole
will sing about twice the number or.
pieces usually sung by the complete
organization.

Among the new pieces which will'
be given are: ”The Song of a Star,"'
the words of which were written by
Longfellow, and the music by nuschy
“The Worship of God in Nature," by
Beethoven; the choice song used by
the club in the Chicago contest. “The
Reveille." by Elgar; and “The Cru-
saders," by McDowell, an American
composer. The last named is airin-
terpretative number which tells of the
spirit of the crusaders on the march,
the threat to the Scaracens, and the
crusader’s longing for borne. the white
cliffs and old England, *
