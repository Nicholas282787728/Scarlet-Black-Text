Things Yet To Come...

We wonder if you have lealized the potent-
ialities of our new gymnasium yet. True,
we have seen it since last year, but we as
Glinnellians, have not yet used the gym as
a Grinnell building. True, the men are now
using it for conditioning. But there is some—
thing lacking in‘ the new edifice—it is the
oft—spoken of Grinnell Spirit.

There is a definite contribution the
students of Glinnell can make for this build-
ing. You can imbue it with a tradition that
will last until the walls crumble—or it turns
into a recreation parlor. Your oppor-
tllnity will be at hand at the first basketc

asthey have never done before Lalger and
more influential colleges will come to this
campus as opponents because we have the
facilities to handle them. With every new
team that comes and goes from this
campus, the name of Grinnell is carried with
them The physical properties are for us to
enjoy. It remains for us, the classes of
1943-44-and 45 to place Within the cold walls
of this newly-born the warmth, the friendli»
ness, the drive, the fight, the will to win—
in short, the Spi t of Old Grinnell.

They're In This Too-

lt‘s startling to think of the number of men
that will be leaving the campus in January
to join some branch of the armed forces.
It’s astonishing to know the extra hours of
Work they're carrying, or the extra time
and money they‘ve spent to make their ser-
vices possible.

Theie is another part of the Grinnell
constituency that is working just as hard
for the same cause and is receiving less rec-
ognition than it deserves—faculty mem-
bers and administrators.

Because we don’t hear of each individ-
ual appointment or accomplishment, we are
inclined to believe that these men and W0—
men go on about their business of pounding
knowledge into our heads, giving tests, lec<
turing, etc. without a care for the rest of
the world, except zi glance at the front page
of the morning paper.

Yet some ale Walking for the state,

Ferguson Says
---AIone

No sugar, no meat, no rubber, no
oil, no gas, no gum, no men; and
because we have an acute lohol-
shortage, Grinnelllans will have
to shufﬂe their way through
leaves when they decide to travel
across campus this year, Ray
Ferguson, heating plant supco
visor. explained last night.

“It's for the same reason that
repair work on the cinder walks
"has not been done,” he added.
There aren't enough men avail-
ublc to perform jobs other than
the most. urgent ones. We have
managed to keep the grounds
around Main Hall in good shape
besides a. few other spots on the
campus, but the most part we
will have to let go."

Last year, 32 tons of leaves
were removed from campus prop-
erty.

To Conserve

Form Committee To

Compacts, Keys, Junk

A central War conservation com-
mltteee has been set up by Helen
Landes, James sophomore, chairr
man of the conservation program
for the quadrangle. Harriett
Rasmussen is Conservation repre~
sentativc in Mears, Marcia Reed

Ruth Wagner in Haincs.

Silk and nylon hose, old com—
pacts and lipstick containers, old
keys, and bottle caps and tin cans
are the main things the college
student should have. There will
not be conservation of paper this
year as there was an overamount
saved last year which has not
been reused; Miss Landcs said.

Mode of Presentation Handicaps
Gates Lectures, Reviewer Says

Hesiianc Of Speaker
Fails To Iimulai‘e In \
Present Crlhcal Period

By Joseph Laonr

The Gates Memorial Lectures
are over. 'In one important
respect Dr. John Coleman
Bennet must be commended.
Representing a calm, judicial
theologian’s judgment of the
predicament of Christian in
the midst of dynamic forces
daily altering the secular and
spiritual conceptions of the
world, Dr. Bennett attempted
to present to the Grinnell
students a logical set of prin-
ciples which were at the same
time plactically possible and
harmonious with Christian
ideals.

But as a Gates lecturer. he
failed to an extent. He failed, not
because of the luck of dynamic
content in his speech, but be
cause of the sedative qualities of
his delivery and organization. His
hesitancy, which might to a class
in the theology be a proof of
authority, his droning elaborate-
ness, which might to students of
Christianity prove an effective
contrast to his forceful ideas,
were to the students of Grinnel‘l
an excuse to comfortably ignore
the pertinent questions raised by
the speaker.

Dr. Bennett was to make the
students awake to the problems
of at Christian in a war world, not
to put them to sleep in Hcmck
chapel. He must be said, there-
fore, to have failed partially in
fulfilling the purpose of the
Gates Lectures this year.
Change in the Church

Dr. Bennett opcucd the series
with the statement that in the
last 50 years 'the institutional

structure of the church has under-
gone a profound and sweeping
change. Outlining the character-
istics of this change, he laid a

background for his further lec-
tures by pointing out that church
leaders are looking at the world
from the point of vlew of those
most victimized by the present
Society.

There Is no sound basis for as-
serting that Christianity and dem—
ocrncy are linked inherently, he
said in his lecture. Bennett can»
ceded, however, that the type of
society produced today, that is,
under democracy, was the type
which provided an opportunity
for the creation of a Christian
world of love, order and peace.

A Christian in War

In the third and fourth lectures
Dr. Bennett surveyed the alter-
nate strategies open to 8. Chris-
tian in this time of crisis. He de-
fined the word "crisis" in the con-
text of present day event: as the
dllcmo of choosing between two
intolerable evils: on the one hand,
the support of a wal- which, like
any war, is the chucked: of all
moral precepts of Christianity;
and, on the other hand, the posi—
tion of lion-support and its in-
evitable consequences of spiritual
dud physical enslavement of in-
nocellt mosses.

Rejecting the views or uncl‘
cal support of the War, any var-
iety of pacifism, and the double
standard involving the suspension
of Christian judgment about the
war for the diuotion, hc proposed
his own program of Christian cri-
tical support of the war; Chris-
tians should lead the people to
adapting the principles of loving
their enemies and stemming the

~tide of fanatic hatred against the

ordinary citizens of Germany ‘and
Japan.

What Will Be Peace?

In his ﬁfth and concluding leco

upon which the Allies might hope
to win the peace. Probably the
most significant remark of his
final address was his closing
plea to remember the fascist rev-
olutions which have been respon-
sible for the present world Wide

Nichols Says

Too Many Positions For
Number Of Grads Now:
Some Already Hired

Senior job surveys have been.
eliminated oguln this year, oihcc
there are jobs offcls now than
there are students, Dr. Albert.
Nichols, said today. In the past
years. groups of seniors, have
gone to Chicago and mlmeopclis,
to talk with employers concern-
ing chances for employment. Dr.
Nichols added that this would
be hindered also by gas rationing
and rubber shortage.

The decision as to Whether or
not senior job forum, will be
held this year, is still in doubt,
Nichols said. Since the execution
of this involves employers from
nearby cities visiting the campus
to meet with seniors, the question
of gas rationing also enters this
picture.

Because of unsettled conditions,
employers are visiting the campus
now, however to line up seniors
for jobs following their graduar
tion in spring. Also the Army
is putting in Ha bid for students
trained in the technical and cler-
ical fields, Nichols concluded.

The'I'a Sigs To

Barbara Brhnn, Lucia Carter, and
Catherine Funk have pledged

nett, president, announced to—
day.

Pledges are chosen from women
students majoring or specializing
in Journalism and meeting grade
requirements, Miss Bennett sold.
