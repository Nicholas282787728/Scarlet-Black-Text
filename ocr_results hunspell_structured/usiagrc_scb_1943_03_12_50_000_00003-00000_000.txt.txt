Red Cross
Slarl's Drive

Volunteer workers under the
direction of Mrs. Velma Hiser,
committee chairman, will cover
the campus this Frlday in'he-
half of the 1943 Red Cross War
Fund drive. contrioutions will
go to help make up the Grinnell
chapter quota, which is appl'
mately double that of a year
ago.

“If any group should respond
wholeheartedly to the War Fund
slogan, ‘Thls year I'm giving dune
ble,’ the students on the college
campuses should," Mrs. Hiser be
ileves.

“Already hundreds of Gi-innell
alumni are scattered over the
globe Wlth the armed forces. Per
haps so or 90 per cent of the
men how on thé campus will be
in the service within a few
months.

“The Red Cross represents the
only official link between mess
men and their homes," Mrs. Hiser
reminds. “Among the major com-
modities your War Fund dollars
will be comfort and peace of
nllndﬁyes, and in some cases,
even a chance to liveﬁfor these
boys you all know so well.

“When a volunteer approaches
you, just keep in mind how pen
sonally important it is to you
that the ,Red Cross have ample
funds to perform its endless ser-
vices for the armed forces,” Mrs.
Hiser urges, “Give cheerfully,
and‘GIVE DOUBLE!"
