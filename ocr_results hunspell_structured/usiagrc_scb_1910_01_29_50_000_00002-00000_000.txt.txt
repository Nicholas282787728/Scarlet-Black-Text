At the University oi Chicago it is
reported that a committee or tile iae.
ulty has been appointed to receive or -
ieisins train the stud s on the “urn
done by the protossoi-s in the cia. .
room. A periodic evaminatioii oi this
sort might be inst as helpful iis a sini-
iinr examination at the student. it
should certainly prove stimulating and
enlightening and might be as valuable

THE CASE .lG UN. ’1‘ FOOTBALL.

In a general way it may he sold oi
all college athletic activity at the pres
ent time that it serves or is supposed
to serve, three purposes.

F st—To silord a healthy rational
relaxation tor the largest number pos»
sible of students in vigorous athletic
contests.

secondgit is supposed to give some
incentive to car-end, intelligent, piiisi.
cal development through the game
played.

Third—The team, in the iiiteiuclass
and intercollegiate games are supposed
to iurnish occasions where the coin.

Whenever a point is reached where ,

any college game rails in a larvr-
measure to fill these pui-p s its
fnlness is ended. Whenever it hap-
pens that in serving any one or these
interests it seriously retards at the
same time solne other interest, tiie
value or that particular game may be
called in question.

Football as played in Grinllcll and

most at the other colleges oi sinnlnr »

serious question it it serves- put one oi
the interests mentioned, iiiiuiolr tin»

Excepting the tliioe laige institutions
in the state there is- but one college in
Iowa in which at some time during the
past season there wasn't a plea made
for men “to get out ior tooth-all." What
for? Families: for the game? No.
"For eollege loyalty‘ to make possible
a better college t sin; to uphold the

reputation or the institution."

Men in Grinnell and other colleges
over the country were (called on to sac:
rlfice themselves {or a sport. for a
game that is supposed to inrnish
healthy relaxation from the ordinal}
duties of student. life. -

Men in Grinnell and men in other
colleges lcsponded to this call and did
their best to keep up the "spiiit of the
college, but nt an altogether gloat cost
of time and energy.

How many times within the last ten
years has it been necessaly to call on
men to play baseball basket ball, tone
his or take pnit ln ﬁeld and truth
games? The diiiercnce is not in the
men, but in the game. When a game
is provided that fulfills the require
ments or a sport, when it is within the
reach or the average student‘ 3 time and
energy, there will he an abundance of
materiiil [or ii fall sport.
