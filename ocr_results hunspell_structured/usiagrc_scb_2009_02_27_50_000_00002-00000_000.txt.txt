Mock trial team qualifies for nationals

For fourth time, lawyer team will travel to Kansas City for national tournament

EV CHASE FELKER

On the weekend of Feb 13»14, Grinilell's two mock trial
teams cnmpetcd in the regional competition at st. Ambrose
University in Davenport, Iowa. For the fourth time in the
team‘s l4eyear history, a Grinnell temn qualiﬁed for nation-
215.

One of Grillncll’s two teams took fifth
place and was the only team to tie Loras
College and Illinois State, which took first
and third place respectively, in individual
matches.

Co-captain Alex ConlOn ’09 attributed
the team’s success to more cohesive prepa-
ration, and a strong group of undeiclass
students. “Instead ofjust running through
the motions, we had a more focused, colt
laborative environment,” Conlon said,

Adam Lange ’11 said that splitting the group into two
strong teams, a requirement due to the team’s large size, was
useful as they could practice against one another and simus
late actual matches, “Practicing against [each other] helped
a lot," Lange sai .

In comparison to larger schools. where
teams practice upwards of ﬁve times a
week, according to Coecaptain Chris John

early from winter break in order to begin
more intense preparation for the regional
competmonJohnston said that the (listhT
ity between Grinnell and larger schools
made the qultllﬁcatlon for nationals even
more impressive.

Johnston added that the team was
not fully prepared the tournament, and said the opening
statements were written on the way to the tournament. “I
wouldn’t go so far as to call it improv,"]ohnston said, “But
we do a good job of thinking on our feet,"

However, the team found stability in the coaching and

legal advice ofGriilnell lawyer Brad McCallt

“I think my primary role with the team has been to assist
the students in learning appropriate court room practice,
procedure and demeanor," McCall wrote ill an e-lnall to
the 58d}. “In addition,l think that l have helped to teach
the students the intricacies ofthe Rules of
Evidence.”

Even with professional mentor-
ing, Conlon said the team still has a few
Grinnellian quirks. “It's a very Grinnell
teamiwe have a tough time getting ev»
eryone into suits," she said

Mock trial simulates major elements of
a trial and serves as an unofﬁcial pre-law
program. For the competition, the team
receives witness statements and basic case
information attorneys would receive at the beginning of the
academic year. The mock case played in the tournament
involved a politician arguing that she lost an election due to
libel from a reporter. The mock article contained false acV
cllsations ofmutder, and led to court action by the politician
against the reporter. Prior to the case, the teams determine

who would argue the prosecuting and de
fending side.

The second Grinncll team. despite
racing multiple top teams. had very close
rounds and nearly qualiﬁed, according to
ConlOIL Additionally, Erin Daugherty
'09, Liting Cong’11,and Max Kaufmaon
'12 won outstanding witness awards for
portrayals of “drunken journalists" and a
"crazy janitor," according to Lange. “We
basically kicked ass,"said Johnston.

Nationals will be held in Kansas City,
Mlssouri during the ﬁrst weekend of spring break, March
13715

“It will be really close because at this high level all of
the teams obviously know what they are doing and are all
very competitive," Laage said.
