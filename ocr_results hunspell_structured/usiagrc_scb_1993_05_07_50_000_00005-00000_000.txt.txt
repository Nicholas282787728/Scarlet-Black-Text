Huang creates his
own personal Hull

Visionary theatre designer Mark Huang may outdo himselfwith
his next epic production, simply but enticingly titled Hull.

Described as a “Light and Sound Spectacular," Hull takes the
form ofa four-movement work for music, lights and special effects on
the Roberts Theatre stage The production may also include two
human 1' i gures, who will probably serve less as actors than as sculp-
tural forms to be molded with subtle inﬂections of light.

Huang says that he does not intend to convey any message or tell
any story with Hull. Instead, itexists for sheer tun. What the audience
will see are renderings of pictures that ﬂashed upon the artist‘s mind
when he heard the music that accompanies them.

Hull will be performed only once, on Wednesday, May 19 at
8:00 pm. in Roberts Theatre. —Jr'm Krnpa
