Little Economic Intercourse Be-
tween Central European Pow-

Dr. Edward A. Steiner, who has
just returned lroma three month's
trip through Europe and parts of Ruse
sin, reports that he finds conditions
over there exceedingly discouraging.
"There were no victors in the great
war," said Dr. Steiner in an inter-
vicw Saturday. “Every nation of
Europe was defeated. As I went from
one country to another l could not
help feeling how hopelessly stupid
most of the people were in tho catas—

cording to Dr. Steiner. There is the

In between these two factions

see no prospect of peace among the
countries.
Conditions Billl

There is no legal economic intsve
course between those countries, sa s
Dr. Steiner, and whatever trade is can
lied on among them is done by means
of smuggling. The worst situation is
found in Austria, where the coinage
has been dchascd to such an extent
that the exchange rate between Alls—
ti-inn crowns and American dollars ls

According to Dr. Steiner the
state of Iowa could be more selfrsus

country is practically forced to live
on her own resources today.

In Russia Dr. Steiner says the hole

cratic, but private property is so i -

In western Europe Dr. Steiner finds
that the outward scars of war are
practically licalcd, with the exception
of northern France, but in the east
the situation is almost as bad as it
was during the war. Fighting is still
going on in this part of the count

League is Dcllll

“The League of aliens seems to
be a dead thing," said Dr Steiner.
“I believe that it would have had the
respect of Eiiropc if America had
been in, but as it is, the League is
not truly representative. The Amer—
ican dollar has bccomc the standard
of values. The Anicrican relief oi»

Dr. Steiner, “but after [hrue month's

Founded Thirty rcais.

The Hill prize originated in 1891
when Dr. James L. Hill and Dr. Gel»
sllom H. Hill, brothers, gave $700 to
round it perpetual annual prize to be
lilloWn as the "I'llll prize for the pro-
motion of excellence in cxtempor-
nueous address." Prof. Clzu'a. M.
Smel‘tenko, '93, now a member of the
Gl'innell faculty, was the ﬁrst woman
to receive ﬁrst honors in this contest.
In 1805 the terms of the contest Were
broadened to include a. sight singing
contest. The methods of award were
again changed in 1912 to meet the
growing interest displayed in the Col:-
test. Separate contests for men ondl
women were originated in both the
speaking and singing division. The
lund has since been increased to $5,000
and the prizes are as follow Speak
ing, ﬁrst, $45; second, 525; thud, s15.
Singin First, $25; second, $15.

Fluculty Winners. ‘

It is interestig to note that, besides
Prof. Smertenko, other members of the
local faculty who won honors in the
Hill contests are: (Speaking) Eleam
nor Lowden, '03, and Harold strong,
’1]; (Singing) David Peck, '03, and
Mrs. Robert Bouma, '18. Also in 191d-1
'19, due to the war taking so many
men from-the College, no men were
entered in the singing contest.

During the thirty years since the
founding of the prize one hundred and ,
scvcntcen awards have been granted
in the speaking section and seventy-
two in the singing.
