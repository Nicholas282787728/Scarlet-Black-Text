President Nollen
Continues Work
Despite Injury

Cheerful in spite of a plaster
cast which holds his head in an
unnatural position, Pres. John s.
Nollen announced yesterday his
hopes to be about the campus in
the near future. He plans to go to
Des Moines early next week to
have the cast removed.

At that time he will be fitted
with a leather apparatus which he
described as a “dog collar." Mr.
Nollen hopes that he will be able
to go to his office and begin at-
tending campus functions again
when he gets the collar.

The cast was removed from
Mrs. Nollen‘s fractured arm Mon-
day. she is now going out for
the first time since their automo—
bile accident this summer.

President Nollen is conducting
college business from his home.
Mrs. Eva Broders Hansen, his sec~
retary, takes dictation from him
every day, and all business is con-
ducted by correspondence. Some
faculty committee meetings have
been held at the president's
home.

convention in Sioux City a short
time ago, Dr. Nollen, who is gover—

Welcome New Ideas

Young people today should ﬁnd much to their liking in the
policies of management adopted by our modem railroadl.
Nothing is sacred merely because it is old. Policies are based
solidly upon the test-lube ﬁndings of current public uwlul~
ness and favor. 0 Consider these evidences of railway
experimentation: Reduced taxes, faster and more convenient
schedules, streamline trains, added con-lion and beauty in
passenger equipment, lower-priced meals, air-conditioning,

of less-than-carload freight—such innovations bring luster
to the long-held railway advantages oi salary, economy and
dependability. C The Illinois Central System is especially
proud cl its Green Diamond, $425,000 nailed-minute stream-
line train xecenﬂy placed in service. It has been called a

Education today must keep in
