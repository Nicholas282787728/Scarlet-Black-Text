The Handlcap Hundred.

Last Saturday was run the loo-
yard handicap. The men enter-
ing showed up in remarkably good
form and all in all, the event was
a success. Byers with ten yards
won the ﬁrst heat In ten seconds.
This had a very exciting ﬁnish tor
Baer pushed Byers closely to the
tape. The second heat was won
by Spaulding with seven yards,
over Atkinson with eight yards
and )ames with ten. Grey with
eight yards won the third heat
over Harvey, the little Denver
high schuol sprinter. This heat
was won in ten seconds also. Only
the winners of each heat were al-
lowed to compete in the ﬁnals and
as their handicaps were close it
developed a very exciting ﬁnish.
Spaulding won ﬁrst; 'Grey, with
eight yards, second; and Byers,
with ten yards, third. Time, IO
1-5 seconds.

Third Team VS. High School.

The management had a game
scheduled with Brooklyn, tor the
third team last Saturday on the
home grounds, but on account of
some hindrances Brooklyn, was
unable to appear and so a game
was arranged with the Grinnell
high school. Both teams put up
a good clean game of tootball,
some ot the new men showing up
very well. Twenty minute halves
were played. during which neither
team was able to score. During
the ﬁrst half the ball was kept
near the middle ot the ﬁeld and
neither goal was in danger. in
the second halt the high school
rushed the ball to tile gyard line!
where the scrubs held them tor‘
downs. When time was called that
ball was in the high school's terrl
ritoiy.
