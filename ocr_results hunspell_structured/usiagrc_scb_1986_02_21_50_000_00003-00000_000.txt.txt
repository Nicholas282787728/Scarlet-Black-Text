Joint Board held a relreshingly brief
meeting last Wednesday night at 7:30.
Discussion centered around Semantics and
a proposal to raise tunds tor a scholarship
to be given to worthy black South Africans.

SGA President Susannah Richards,
began the meeting with a presentation of a
letter written by George Drake. In the let-
ter. Drake stipulated that SGA funds could
not be allocated to student scholarships
However, the Chairman of the Committee
on Student Politics, All Elsall'er, already
has submitted a proposal to students
regarding the possibility of establishing a
scholarship for black South Africans.

261 students signed the proposal and ex
pressed their approval of the scholarship.
it a proposal is approved by over 200
students then an all—campus vote may be
initiated, Thus, the black Souﬂi African
scholarship proposal will be presented
before the student body and the votes will
be (allied to determine the Viability of in-
itiating a new scholarship using SGA
funds.

Although President George Drake stated
that student monies could not be donated
to the establishment of scholarships. Phil
Cantor, a member oi Students to End
Apartheid. stressed the possibility of set
ting a precedent. Cantor spoke with a
lawyer who said that action by the
students could possibly establish a new
scholarship, .

In other news, George Drake and Jim
Tederman who have both spoken with
Susannah Richards earlier this week, in-

the somewhat higher salaries altered by
large universities, it can come close; star-
ting annual salaries at Grinnell are only a
low thousand dollars less than the average
starting salary ollered by a typical state
university.

The increase in salary allurded by the
increase in tuition will thus help Grinnell
catch up with the salaries offered by large
institutions. as well as get ahead of those
olrered by comparable smaller colleges.

In the case of Professor HurthtZ.
however, salary was not an object. and the
college community can only wish him well
as he embarks on a new stage or his
career.

Students were saddened when they first
heard or HurWitz's resignation. As one stu-
dent said, “He's my advisor, he‘s the best

ed in either the Forum, a college owned
house. or the 1st ﬂoor of Fell House.
Richards also announced that due to per-
sistent complaints from students, Dave
McConnell will conduct a survey regarr
ding smoking in the dining halls. Many
students have expressed their disapproval
of the present situtation and have in-
dicated that too much space is allocated
for smokers in Quad dining hall. After the
survey is conducted, the results will be
presented to the committee on Student Lire
and turther action will be initiated.
And ﬁnally, there was bad news for
movie bulls, Richards announced that
there will be no changes made in the sound
system used in ARH Auditorium. New
~speakers were purchased recently, but the
improvement is minimal The Auditorium
is not slated for renovation {or another two
years, but the administration does not
want to invest money into a project that
will be remedied in the near luture.

Quashie, a former editor of the S 84 B,
does not intend The Cornerstone to be a
competitor of either The Outcry or the
Scarlet and Black. He noted that in lulﬁll-
ing its goals. the S & B is to be oriented to
current campus events, which he said are
often “inherently dull”, He said the cams

though, contrasts to the priorities at The
oiitci-y.

Perhaps the most challenging goals
Quashie has set [or The Cornerstone is that
of being a progressive paper, Quashie feels
that Grinnell needs a paper ol'more liberal
politics just as much as the campus needs
one of the political conservatism The Out-
cry espouses.

Administrative response to Robert
Quashie’s endeavors has been extremely
positive. Quentin Johnson, director or in
ternational students and minority affairs,
said or The Cornerstone.
“It's a newspaper that really has the
potential to be a great communicator of
cultural concerns."

Johnson also feels that as the paper
grows and develops. the impact on both the
Black Grinnell community and the Grin-
nell community at large will be tremenr
dousl_y benelicial.
