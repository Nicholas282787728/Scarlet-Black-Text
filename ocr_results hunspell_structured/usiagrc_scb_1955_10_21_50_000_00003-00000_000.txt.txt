‘Palronize Your Adierlisers |

Why do more college

men and women smoke

' 'VICEROYS

than any Other
‘ ﬁlter cigarette?

Because only Viceroy
gives you 20,000 ﬁlter traps '
in every ﬁller tip, made
from a pure natural substance ,
— cellulose —fo und in delicious
fruits and other edibles.’

Yes, only Viceroy has this ﬁlter composed of 20,000 tiny
. ﬁlter traps. You cannot obtain the same ﬁltering action
in any other cigarette.

The Viceroy ﬁlter wasn’t just whipped up and rushed to

2. market to meet the new and skyrocketing demand for £1-
tered cigarettes. Viceroy pioneeredi Started research nwrz
than 20 years ago to create the pure and perfect ﬁlter.

Smokers en masse report that ﬁltered Viceroys have a
. liner ﬂavor even than cigarettes without ﬁlters. Rich;
satisfying, yet pleasantly mild.

Viceroy draws so easily that you wouldn’t know, without
. looking, that it even had a ﬁlter tip . i . and Vicel-oys cost
only a penny or two more than cigarettes without ﬁlters!

That‘s why more college men and women smoke VICEROYS than
any other ﬁller cigaretle . . . that’s why VICEROY is the largest.
selling ﬁlter cigarette in the world!
