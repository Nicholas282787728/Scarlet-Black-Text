Recycling abused

To the campus community: ,

since 1991, Grinncll College has instituted a thorough
recycling program in the residence halls and campuswwncd
houses. As a campus community, however, we seem to raise this
system for granted. A number orstudents and Facilities Man-
:gcment employees have observed blatant misuse or the recy

For instance.

Unfortunately, FM doesn't have the lahor resources to sort
through the bins, so hins containing improperlysorted or non.
reeyelable items are thrown away with garbage. IfFM discovers
areas oieampus in which the setting is consistently poor, they
may stop recycling in these areas :llrogcrlmr.

FM does not reeycle some common items (eg. colored
glass), so we recommend bagging such items separately and
raking them to the city‘s recycling center or, for those items
with deposits, to a' redemption center near you.

Look for recycling guides in the dorms soon. As residents

environmental commitment, we should be able to rim a
smoother recycling program than we have been.

Slave to mainstream world

Students speak
out about what’s
on their minds in
142 words, and
you’re invited! If
you have a
random rant,
email it to

complainaing in a
public forum is
always more fun
than doing it'
alone.

 

Shocked as those oryou who know me might be to
discover this, 1 am a rabid Cubs fan. 50 when Opening
Day rolled around Monday, I was naturally enthused
and watched what part ofthe opener 1 could, and had
a plan forthe games that i can't watch: 1 was going to
listen to them, via webcast, air of the cubs website.
Nothing could be simpler, right?

Wrong. I quickly discovered their couldn't connect
to the WGN-AM web stream as usual, then, upon going
to the Major League Baseball site, 1 realized that the
reason why not is because MLB is charging TEN DOL-
LARS to listen to games over the not. what the HELL is
that? Why should 1 have to pay Major League Baseball
more money to do something I could do for free a
months ago? Capitalism sucks.

I have the utmost affection for SGA. Even at a
quarter past midnight, r secretly enjoy Joint Board.
Perhaps disillusionment is on its way, but for now I
truly believe that the members oroutstudent govern-
ment are good people who care deeply about the
Grinnell community. And so I am troubled to hear the
consistent complaints by members or the student body
who feel alienated from, annoyed by, or frustrated
with 56A.

Iam not inﬂamed with passionate anger, so I am
not ranting. Instead 1 am expressing my uncertainty
as to how to fix this problem. How can we reconnect
students to their voices in student government? 15
this something that Grinnell students care about? Or
should I curb my idealism and resign my expectations
of SGA to something more mediocre?

I wear Abercrombie all the time. I own Backstreet
Boys and Britney Spears ms. 1 unabashedly drink Coke.
I wear Lancome and Clinique makeup to class. Some
people would consider me a slave to the corporate
mainstream world, but being more than I could stand.
Perhaps some complaints are justiﬁed, but the fact is
these corporations signify the real world. We may not
like it, but if we ever want to Succeed in it, we need
to deal with it, Or else some of you are going to be
poor schmucks trying to eke out an existence, while
the rest or us will be going to work in Armani, driving
a Lexus, and actually being able to comfortably pro-
vide for our children. Hmm. What a concept.
