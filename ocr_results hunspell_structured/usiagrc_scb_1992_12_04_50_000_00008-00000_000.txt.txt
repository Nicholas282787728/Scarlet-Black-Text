Men’s Basketball meets Knox
and Illinois College this weekend

by Alex Bevel-ans

After four non-conference
games, the Grinnell College men's
basketball team is 3-1 and looking
forward toa very full week. The team
lost to Luther yesterday 57-55 in the
last nonrleague game before Mid-
west Conference play starts here to
day against Knox. Saturday another
conference rival, Illinois College, will
come calling. According to assistant
coach Andy Hamilton, this week is
most imponant btmause the two con-
fcrencegames will setthetoneforthe
rest of the season.

“To be successful in conference
play, we must win at home,” says
Hamilton. “The games with Knox
and Illinois College are particularly
crucial because we need to feel conﬁr

dent going into next week‘s game on
the road against defending champi-
ons,Monmouth. Ail ofthe teams we
will play this week will be a step up
from our competition up to this point,
so we must step up our play to get off
to a good conference start."

Last week the Pioneers used a
second-half onslaught to come away
witil an 82-48 victory over Principla.
Despite the large margin of victory,
Coach Hamilton noted that the team
was only ahead by sixat haiftimcand
made many mistakes throughout the
game. “In the last few games we have
btxen getting by, butwe have not had
consistent intensity. We are making
too many mental mistakes to compete
with the strong teams in our confer-
ence," Hamilton said.

One of the Pioneers’ problems in
the Principia game was shooting too

soon,noted Hamilton. “We took fairly
good shots, butlfwe could have been
more patient, we could have had bet-
ter shots.” Hamilton did have words
of praise for the aggressive offensive
play of Steve Diekmann and Geoff
Johnson. Diekmann shot 4/6 from
Lhethree-pointiineandZS pointsoverr
all,while the freshmanlohnson added
22polnts. Todd Young‘s ﬁveassists,
to go along with only one turnover,
also were a highlight of the game.
Solid defensiveoffortsbylason Francl
and Chad Folsom provided some
important intangible contributions,

The Pioneers were Scheduled to
play Grand View last Wednesday,
but the game was snowed outand will
be re-scheduied later.

sium, where they are undefeated, for

ference rival Cornell yesterday,

“It can only get better, and it
will,” said Coach Ted Eskildsen fol
lowing three straight road losses. The
Pioneers started the week with a 73-
65 defeat atWiliiam Penn which was

three loose balls. At the start of the
second half William Penn scored 10
straight points and were ahead by 18
at the 10 minute mark. The Pioneers
then put together a solid run and cut
the lead to four with three minutes to
go, but could not take the lead.
Eskildsen said, "In getting back into
the ball game we showed our poten-
tial. We just have to put it together.”
Amy Fort led the Pioneers with 17
points while Kiera Henry added 11.

Last Saturday the Pioneers lost
to Hamilne,70-61, while piaying“as
bad a first half as we have ever
played." in the words of Eskiidsen.
After being down, 3927, at halftime
theGrinneilians foughtbacktoaone-
point deﬁcit, 41-40, three minutes

get any closer. Kari Hallett scored l4
points, Fort added 13. and Dacey

Waldron had 10. Jen Kelly had nine
assists while Trisha Thode had eight
rebounds. Henry sustainedasprained
knee and will miss the rest of this
semester.

The Pioneers continued to
struggle Sunday in losing to
Macalester, 73-49. During the ﬁrst
minute of the gameJenKelly sprained
an ankle which limited her to only 10
minutes of action. In addition, lead
ing scorer Fort (12 points) picked up
three quick fouls and played only 18
minutes. Eskildsen said, “Their size
and shooting ability took control of
the game. In order for us to be effec-
tive we must cut down on our tum-
overs and have more situational
awareness, We have the capabilities
to become a good team, anti we will
get better.“
