Grinnell is its own

I understand fear. We live in a frightening time, ifyou watch
the news. Fear is an understandable reaction when confronted
with the terrifying acts ofviolencc occurring all across America.
My problem is the deprh with which this fear has permeated
ourgthinking, gripping us with such paranoia that we're turning
against one another. Fear is destroying
our sense of communiry.

Example: a Grinnell srudcnr
makes a posting on Plans that can be
considered a threat of violence. Those
who know the student (and many who
don't) realize the threat is not serious,
but perhaps some in the Plans conic
munity are not convinced.

Some become afraid. Administrators, deeming themselves re-
sponsible for srudenr safety, become afraid is well. They become
so fearful that they solicit outside authority to take action. As a
result a member of our community—perhaps deranged but most
likely peculiarly outspokeneis sacriﬁced to judgment by outside
authority.

Most if not all of the Grinnell College
community, even if they agree with the actions
micen by rhe administration, would consider
such a situation unfortunate. One of our fol-
low srudenrs was jailed on rhe prercnsc that he
intended to commit an act ofviolence, when in
fact he had no intention. Ajokc was coiisidcicd
a threat, and as a result thcjokcr was treated as
A terrorist,

Without condoning or condemning ndr
ministrativc actions, I think we can all agree that this is a sad
state of affairs. This student is not a tcirorist. Then how could he
cud up in state custody facing felony charges? How could such
an absurd misunderstmding rake place? Horn did irgrr Mir/211'?l
contend that we arrived at such a state its a rcsulr ofan omniprCSr
ent sense of fear.

Why are we so afraid ofonc another? Granted, ieccnt history
has shown that violence can reach us anywhere. But are such ncts
of violence rcrilly so random? We, as constituents of our coin-
miiiiity, are directly responsible for rhc safety of our own envrrom
mcnr, Violence is n symptom otsocinl disharmony.

As it communiry, wc reap what wc sow. Ifsiich a tliient ofvlor
lcuce is taken seriously, it means we have no faith in the stability
of our community. Is Grinnell College so hosrrlc an environment
that we might start shooting each other as thc result ofa Plans
posting? Do we really think one of our own is capable of that? Is
our communiry rlinr sick?

What I'm rrying ro say is that Grinnell college is not Amcr-
ica, in many ways. As a narion, America is in drshnrmony with
the global community. Therefore America faces violence through
terrorism.

Speciﬁc communities in America have faced violent eruptions

Letters to

the Editor

The dbl/fly [a question authority and
social norms are things we love
too about Grinnell blll the right to
yio/enr/y threaten authority or a
student/'5 not offended to anyone,

r ”‘4 hp,

country, in a way

in the past due to structural violence within the community. ButI
believe Grinnell is dirrercnr. We have a community relatively free
from friction, internal and external. While Uncle Sam has reason
ro fear rhe chickens coming home ro roost, we as Grinnellians
ought not to have such a fear,

We ought [0 know one another
well enough that jocular intimations
orviolencc are not given credence, and
we ought to trust one another enough
ro mediate our problems within the
community.

Ideally, we would handle our affairs
as Grinnellinns, secure in our mutual
trust ofand goodwill rownrds each orher, not as generic Ameri»
cans, fearful of the next attack.

Furthermore, this idea can be extracted to the principles of
selfrgovernancc. Self-governance exists based on the belief that a
healthy communiryibc ir a floor, a college, or a slate—can me-
diate itself best independently, without appealing to outside aus
thoriry. Decisions made by outside arbitrators
or based on the sentiments of a larger, more
abstract group are invariably worse rhan those
mrde by an imimare, autonomous, self-deter»
mining community.

Yes, 1 advocate identifying is Grinnellians
before Americans. I say this because we as a
campus community can relate as individuals,
whereas our connccrion as Americans is highly
superﬁcial. Consequently American rules ofbcs
liilvior fir us far worse than our own. self-grew-
Marla mourn [wing your own nanny.

This sounds radical, but we do it all the time. We all break the
law: we cut the tags offour inartrcsscs,\vcjnyw k,wc.go to Texas
and sodomize cach otherioftcn times we don't give credence to
American law because we feel it doesn’t or shouldn’t to us. This
is n good thing

if a floor can resolve rhe issue of por smoke, why involve rhe
police? How involved is the state of low in campus lire> What
right do they have to govern olii hchriVior?

This is nnr m say i ndvocnrc secession from the Union; rhcre
are times when ornside regulatory forces are ncccssniy. But my
hope is that we can set fern iside mid try to handle our problems
Ill/ui‘Im/[y hrsrerhnr we can selfrgovern. 1 hope we will not be
persuaded by the culture of fear propagated by the mass mcdia,
but that will we be familiar enough with our community that we
can recognize tongucrinrchcck relerenccs to violence.

1 hope we will not be dogmatic followers orsrme and national
law, but that we will regulate our own conduct as a comiiiuliity.1
hope we will not treat each other as subjects ofstate authority, but
as human beings. i hope we reject rear and embrace compassion.
