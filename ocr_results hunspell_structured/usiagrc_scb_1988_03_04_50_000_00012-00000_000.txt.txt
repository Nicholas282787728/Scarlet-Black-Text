Ruggers
Lose and
Learn

by Melissa McLean

At 7 o'clock last Saturday moms
ing, nine rather nervous women
rugby players, their coach, and
one avid ran from the men’s rugby
club set out on a journey to the nor
thern region oi lowa known as
Luther College. All were anxious
and excited. but the early hour
solicited more than a few Snares
during the tworandrarhalI-hour
drive.

When we left, all was Sunshine
here in Grinnell and We expected to
rind the same glorious weather up
in Decorah. As We traveled north
on Highway 53, those oi us that
were awake began to notice slight
changes in the geography, the
most noticeable of which was the
increasing amount or snow on the
ground.

Passing the rugby pitch on the
Luther College campus, we observ-
ed not less than eight inches of
snow. We were all visibly upset:
alter all. this would surely mean
that we would play inside, Were we
ever wrongl Alter numerous ex:
clamations of disbelief we trekked
oil to the pitch to meet our 0p»
ponents: the women's rugby teams
lrom lowa City and Luther,

Luther and lowa City matched
up first. Due to the loot of snow and
the otherwise had conditions con-
ironting us, we only had to play
sevenminute halves, as opposed to
the standard ﬂo-tn-dD-minute
halves, The inexperienced Grinnell
ruggers sat on the side lines and
watched as lowa City quickly
crushed Luther Then It was our
turn to play lowa City. Believe me,
running through a ioot oi snow ior
14 minutes sounds a lot easier than
it is. lowa city's experience and
endurance proved them the vice

. tors. but everyone on the Grinnell

team gave their all and was com-
plimented on their good showing
by the lowa City team members,
Our next adversary was the
Luther team, not quite as good as
lowa City, but still more ex-
perienced than we were. Aiter
another 14 minutes or running in
the Snow, we were exhausted and
our ieet were cold. but everyone
was very excited, We had survived
two matches in one day without
anybody getting too banged up,
and we had learned how to play
rugby. Everyone played well, with
Julie Slivinsky and Cindy Jones ex-
ecuting some amazing plays.
The Women‘s Ruhgy Club is
looking lot-ward to a great ﬁrst
season, as evidenced by their lan-
iastic ﬁrst matches last weekend
at the Winterfest in snowy
Decorah.
