an occasion which in the last year
has assumed as much impoitnnce
in Iowa athletic circles as the state
meeting itself. Advertising mat
ter has been widely distributed
and as thisrsthe only big meet to
be held in Iona City this year it
is probable a large crowd will be
drawn from the surrounding coun-
try. The old time rivalry between
S, U, I. and Grinnell is still exist-
ent and both teams have been
tlaining for months with this event
in view, It will be an occasion
well worth going to see and in
order that no one should have an
excuse tor remaining array, the
management have secured a rate
of 52,00 for lbc round trip. The
train will leave Grinnell at 8:30
