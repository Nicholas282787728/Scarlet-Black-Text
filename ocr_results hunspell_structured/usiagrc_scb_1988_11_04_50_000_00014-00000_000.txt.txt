Volleyball can't

buy a win Women's CC

Roos, Evans 90 for gold eyes title

by George Mclimsey
The Pioneer women's vol»
leyball squad continues to be
plagued with an' inability to put
numbers in the win column. The
women returned empty-handed
from their whirlwind tour of
Wisconsin and Minnesota over
October Break and, more recently,
dropped matches to Upper Iowa
and opponents at the Beloit
Tournament. With the confer-
ence tournament rapidly ap-
proaching. me Pioneers need to
be at peak performance. While
coach Sheila Cain is pleased with
her team's improvement, it is
clear that they have yet to estab-
lish an attack consistent enough
to win games.
Consistency is the key
which, if the Pioneers can ﬁnd it
in time. will unlock the door

which that evasive "W" seems to
be hiding behind. ln matches
with Carleton and Bethel at the
St. Olaf Toumament ovcr break,
the women were still searching.
They took the first game of the
match against Carleton on some
tough serving and scrappy dcr
fense. Unfortunately, the team
was unable to capitalize on the
momentum generated by this
win. falling quietly in the next
two games. Against Bethe], the
Pioneers fought back from one
game down to even the score at a
game apiece. Unfortunately,
consistency failed them again in
the ﬁnal game and they conceded
the match.

showed ﬂashes of the good team
they are gradually becoming. had
failed to produce a win.

Despite the losses. coach
Cain was pleased with her team's
effons. "We've been getting more
and more hustle out of every-
body," she said. "right now we
need to start tuning-up for

sions against Upper Iowa and in
Wisconsin at the Beloit Tourna-

fought but again unrewarding in

the win column.

The Pioneers are ninning
out of time to learn to play at the
high level where they must win
games for an entire match. If

only those ﬂashes of brilliance
which the team often exhibits
could last for more than a game,
the wins would start rolling in.

 

Three is the magic
number Saturday at Beloit. The
men's cross country team will be
looking for their third consecur
tive Midwest Conference cham-
pionship and Greg Evans is
shooting for a third individual
crown.

This week the Pioneers
cracked the Division III rankings.
At 20th they hope for a strong
showing at the conference meet
which will carry them right into
the NCAA regionals. Coach
Will Freeman noted, "This
meet is a great opportunity for
us to run as a group, to post
good times and to build confi-
deuce."

Although the Grinnellians
are the favorites, Cornell will
push them to their limit, Jeff
Maples will carry the Ram's
hopes as he challenges longtime
rival Evans for top honors.
Both runners are strong finish-
ers and Freeman feels it may go
to the tape.

Other top runners for Grin-
nell will be Jonathon Lave, who
was fourth at the Wartburg Invi-
tational last week. David Ham-
mond and Jason Maples, Jeff‘s
brother. The rest of the lineup
will be chosen from two se-
niors, two sophomores and two
freshmen.

 

Griffins endure

Seen here in a "scrum," the men's rigby team lost to the University of Iowa's "B" team
18-9, to "Cap of ” a winless season. The injury-prone Griffins struggled through the Fall,
but will celebrate like true victors nonetheless.

yet another loss

Coming off a strong
showing last Saturday at the
Wartburg Invitational, the
women's cross country team is
looking for a Midwest Confer-
ence championship tomorrow at
Beloit.

At Wartburg the pioneers
were fifth of eight teams but
nudged rival Cornell, 124-140.
Coach Evelyn Freeman antici-
pates her squad, the Rams and
Knox to battle for the conference
crown. She noted both oppo-
nents have five strong runners
and the winning team will need a
total team effort

Coe's Liz Messerly seems
the favorite for the individual
crown while Grinnell's Christine
Thorburn will push her every
step of the way. Last Saturday
the two competitors ﬁnished 1-2.

The Pioneers will rely on
Thorburn, Joanne Sackett and
Heidi Freiburgcr to place near the
top. Last week the former was
léth, the latter finishing 27th.
They both had their best times of
the season.

Coach Freeman was ex-
tremely pleased with the Wart-
burg meet, feeling it was the
proper time for her team to come
together. Nearly the entire squad
ran season's best times and some
injured runners looked as if
they've recovered. Freeman said.
"Overall, it was a great perfor-
mancc which we want to carry us
through the conference meet."
