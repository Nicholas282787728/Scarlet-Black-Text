How to control

Crazy, cant. from p. l l

and stalkers with laser eyes, allowing celebri-
ties a bit of"mc timc,"During their ”CWlY’
acquired time alone, they could be carefully
psychoanalyzed by their mechanized assistant,
thus assuring they don’t dangle their babies
ottn hotel balcony or place them within bit-
ing range ota massive crocodile. Finally, such
constructs could be very useful in ﬁlming
music videos by lcelandic Pop Princesses or
staging attacks on the Governor ofCallforr
nia.The worst scandals can remain under
the table and Neverland will remain a happy,
sparkly plncc.Thc one ﬂaw in this scheme is
that we are still decades away from building
costecffective robots ofsuff‘icicnt complete

proVide the proper protection that today’s
rich and famous need. Until then, the best we
can do is the timeless shove-hand-in-froiit-
ot-camera-wheneexiting-the-courthouse
maneuver combined with frequent visits to
Cabbalists and tattoo studios,

The last suggestion I can make involves
something that might get the panties of fis»
cal conservatives in a bunch: socialized men-
tal health. This is one screwed-up country,
and there are few groups more screwed up
than famous people! Regular mental health
assessment could easily reduce the incidence
of crazy celebrity outbreaks, wardrobe mal-
functions and bat-eating could go back to an
all-time low, 24-hour marriages might even
become a thing ofthe past'rhc only moderae
tion I would suggest would be with cosmetic
surgery and/or military personnel: the army
covers the costs of cosmetic surgery, including
breast augmentation. IIIIPM/wwwfoxnewr. im/

Letters to ,_\
the Editor

Let myjust start by saying that I was a little
confused about Adam Rothstein ‘05’5 October
1st letter to the editor,“Defending pro-life is {as
cist." Last time I checked, using the tried and true
mowilir/r'mmrytum, Rothsteln’s conviction that
he would “Fully support SILENCING this ideals
rstic and harmﬁll notion by any means" ﬁts pretty
well into the deﬁnition of fascism, or, “A system
of government marked by ccnualization of au—
thority under a dictator, stiingent socioeconomic
controls, in}: l‘l‘n‘lolt ofl/M apparition ﬂirting}; terror
and censorship, and typically a policy of bclligcre
ent nationalism and racism" (italics added).

I am a very convicted pictchomcr. I believe
wholeheartedly in a woman’s right to choose and
chili control over her own body, and I iescnt the
mosdy mnlc-led government that makes political
decisions regarding a woman’s body So,I found
it interesting. if not ironic. that Mr. Rothsrein,
a male, rs accusing a group of, from what I can
gather, mostly women, of eremng fascist ideals
on what drey believe is right for them and other
women. Therefore, Rothstein's assertion of the
suppression of the people who are ACTUALLY
ﬁght-mg for their rights seems a little srrangc,conr
sidering that these are women speaking out on
their rights and it is HE who is negating their
contribution It is very clear that Rothstein, as a
male, has never had to contemplate the possibilt
ity that he might be pregnant and grapple with
the fact that he would probably choose to destroy
something alive created by him and someone he
loves. Rothstein eien admits that die “pro-life
group is deﬁnitely not a thieat to me or my loved
ones.

While it is true that women have been and
still are silenced by the mostly male establish
ment, being against this establishment does not
mean Rothstein gets to choose which opinions
women can express regarding their rights

rights, the main reason I had a strong reaction to
Rothstein’s letter is: HE IS NOT HELPING.
By negating its inﬂuence in Congress and say
ing that he or his loved ones are not threatened
by proelife groups, Ruthstein is frankly denying
the power of the pro—life movement in contem-
porary America. The legalization of abortion
doesn't mean that it is by any means available to
all women, and the women close to Rothstcin are
not necessnily frce from political obstacles in re
ceiving abortions I can give as evidence nnytlung
from the Financial woes of Planned Paienthood
in the United States, to Bush’s global gag rule, to
the push for banning of third trimester abortions,
to community piotcsts of abortion clinics in con
seriiitwe nets, to the decrease in the number of
physicians willing to perform the relatively simple
procedure.

This last piece ofint’ormation is partially why
I \mlit to become an OB/GYN and feel a moral
responsibility to make this choice available, I be—
lieve that while abortion is a serious, difﬁcult, and
sometimes wrong decision, I also believe that if
women are to assert equality in this soaety, they
must have annual over their own reproductive
systems and when they have children. I believe
that it is wrong to make a woman carry a baby
that she does not want, as it is to bring an un-
wanted child into the world. And I believe that
this is MORE wrong than killing a fetus,but not
that having an abortion is a desirable or necessary
option when an unplanned pregnancy occurs.

I believe that in the ideal society, abortion
would be obsolete, and that every child brought
into the world would he wanted and loved as it
should be. But that is not the world we live in,
and since I believe that women and children de—
serve the best the world has to oHer them, I am
proechoice, So instead of validating many pro-
lifcrs’ beliefs that I and other pro-choicers are
babykilling. coldehcarted, fcininrzis who have no
morality, maybe you could save your breath on the
fascism claim and make one that might actually
convince the pio-life world that being ptorchoice
is a realistic, moderate, and mood viewpoint

October 8 2004

 

"Have you votod?"lf you heard those "infa-
mous"threc words less than 10 times onTuesday,
you are among a select few. Campus Democrats
and other groups wch as the Feminist Action
Coalition and the Student Campaign for Int
creased Polin'cal Engagement (SCIPE) should
be commended for storming campus with a
wcllrorgnnizcd strategy to maximize voter turn-
out for satellite voting. The result, a remarkable
491 votes cast, surpasses all of the votes cast for
the entire 2002 election.

To those who voted on Tuesday: great work
We understand that early voting does not have
the same “election feel" to it, but you sacriﬁced
your personal preference for the greater good
Byvoting early,you eased the burden on campus
groups to get out the vote at the college. They
can now reallocate some of their resources to
getting out the vote in town and in surrounding
areas. Since you have already voted, you should
strongly consider joining these groups in their
cﬁ’orts. Whether it’s joining Campus Demon
crats on their Ali—break trip or hosting a debate
watching party for SCIPE, there are plenty of
opportunities to volunteerr As the presidential
and vice presidential debates have made abun-
dandy clear, the stakes are high in this election
and thc' diﬂ’erence on issues between the two
candidates could not be greater, Whatever side
ofthc aisle you are on, ive hope that you channel
some ofthe conviction that made you vote early
to help volunteer.

To those who plan on voting in other states:
decide wisely Iowa is Ll‘tc quintessential swing
state. Gore won it by a mere 0.3 percentage
points. A University of Minnesota poll released
Tuesday shows Kerry up only a single point in
the state. Few states, ifany, will be closer.

Ifyou’re one of the many students from Ilr
linois or California, voting in your state over
Iowa makes little sense. Gore won both of these
states by more than 10 percentage points and
Kerry is leading by wide margins as well. Check
Wre/ttzomlvwmwm ifyou have any quesn‘ons
regarding the current status of your state. If it’s
not as close as Iowa, you [Jam untilFa/[Bnak to
[bﬂlifrylmr regitmzti'm [0 were bore.

0 the disenchanted, who plan on bucking
the ptooess altogether: remember the 2000 elec-
tions. Back then it was trendy to say there were
no differences between the two parties. Back
then there was also no Sept. 11th, no Iraq War.
no job loss and no budget deﬁcit. Tire consensus
on voting has changed today. It is easy at a place
like Grinnell, which is largely insulated from the
problems of the “real world,” to have the conve-
nience of being disaﬁected. But those who lose
their job or have loved ones at wat do not have
the luxury of keeping their distance from the
process; they are inanricably linked with it. Keep
this in mind before you decide to stay home on
Nov 2nd.
