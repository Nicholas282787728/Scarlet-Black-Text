at this time of the year there Lire
many which receire less notice than
they really desene. When new Calls

litisnot the intention bokletmct in
the least from the things which they
already recognize ils important, but
merely to give each activity EL lair
show to claim the amount of each
one’s attention which it deserves. No
one can have a. hand in ere 'thing so
everyone should consider calefully
along what line his activity is to be
directed. For the beneﬁt of oldLnud
new students who are interested in
literary work. there is nothing which
oﬁers a greater ﬁeld ioi development
than the monthly magazine known as
the Unit. It has been termed the
"best college literary magazine in the
west", and is founded upon the idea
that college students demand an outs

let for their enemies in this line and
that. all should have a. chance to

develop ability along nhe line or
literary composition.

The Unit isa magazine by and ior

Dr. Steiner’s lecture before the
\Vemau‘s clubs Wednesday night. was
wellattsndod by the milny who are
always glad tn hear an authoritative
statement of Russian conditions. and
every one was well repaid ior liisinr
torest. The description and analysis
oinns uu ail‘airs and the statement
of the situation in that, country were
the expected result of Mr. Steiner's
summer visit to the continent. They
were such as many observing men
might discover, though the state-
ment of them was more than ordin-
urily clear. The phase or the subject,
however, which is important for us is
the one which realy shous us Dr.
Steiner' lidiviililili power. for lie point.
