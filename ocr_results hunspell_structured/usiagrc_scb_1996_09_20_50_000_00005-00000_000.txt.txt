Shallow Grave: a provocative study
in color and character
Symbolism, layers save a, potentially mediocre ﬁlm

by C. SOPHIA ALBOTT
and AMY ROGOWAY
Movie Reviewers

This weekend, SGA hosts the Scot-
tish film Shallow Grave. The direc-
tor, Danny Boyle, has been recently
noted for his production of
Trainspotting, to be featured later this
season.

Shallow Grave launches with .357
tounding potential. We are introduced
tothethreeprotagonists,Alex,lullette.
and Davtd, as they good-naturedly
taunt and humiliate prospective roomr
mates. The setting is primarily the
nucrocosm oftheir apartment with the
different levels characterized by col-
ors and literary parallels. The light
relationship among the three is initially
manifest in the manner in which they
operate in the selection for a potential
addition to their mo, Unfortunately,
the film’s momentum slows with the
devolution of each character into the
cariacture of an Everyman subject to
the degenerative motive of greed.

ing in. The catalyst for the film is the
luring suitcase ofcash found under his
bed. Though all three struggle with

Though all three Jusllfy the oppor-
tune "chance” which delivers them to
wealth, the process ofdispostngofthc

cancc oftheir fortune In reference to
the exorbitant price of a piece ofelece
tronic equipment, David retorts:
“That's how much you paid; we don't
know the cost at it yet."

Through their pragmatism. manipu-
lation, and cmotionalism, the three are
reduced to their most selt‘servtng
characteristics without accepting [Er
sponsibility for theiractions, Although
the director tries to convey this wellr
worn theme through an innovative
plot, the movie tends to be dull at
times.

Perhaps one ofthe more interesting
aspects of the film is the omnipresent
color scheme. While the director is
lax in character development, he
seems to assume archetypal color
symbolism as a suitable replacement
Black and white symbolism not only
artimates David‘s emotional evolution,
but fashionably foreshadows death in
the movie. Juliettc‘s impassioned red
embodies the base drives that fuel the
most primitive actions, while Alex’s
pragmatic blue characterizes his sta-
bility that is ultimately triumphant.
The structured contrast between the
two primary colors becomes the ba-

nal conflict that ultimately guide“ lie

consistency lacking in this film is

found in the upcoming Trainspotting.

Film: The War
Room ,1

The film The Wm Room is named
for the Oil-rllmlls command center
where key Clinton strategies were
shaped during the 1992 campaign
it is an honest, witty, and revealr
ing look at how senior strategist
James Carvlllc and his determined
cadre of collaborators revolution-
lzcd prestdential campaigning
while orchestrating one ofthe most
surprising political upsets in
American history.

As the film progresses, viewers
are taken behind the scenes at the
Democratic Convention, the Presi-
dentlal debates. and the now far
mous highrtech, highenergy Little
Rock war room itself. Ultimately,
viwers experience the triumph of
election night from inside and come
away with a new understanding of

the political process.

from a college press release

Vince Gotcro, n minorltyrscholar-
Il’l’l'CSldel'lCe at Grinncll and a pro
fessor of creative writing and per
ctics at the University ofNorthern
Iowa, will deliver “Reconciliation
and Women's Poetry of the Viet-
nam War.” at 11 am, Thursday,

Sept. 26, in Herrick Chapel.

“In my talk, I plan to illuminate
the roles and actions of women,
both American and Vietnamese. in
the American war in Vietnam,
through an intriguing array of po-
ems. So often we think of that con-
flict as a war fought only by men
especially American men. My pre-

sentation is a small attempt at cor-
rectlng some of those
preconceptions and prejudices,“
Gotera says.

Gotcra is the author of “Radical
Visions: Poetry by Vietnam Veter-
ans,“ the ﬁrst and only comprehen-
sive book-length study of this siz-
able body of poetry.
