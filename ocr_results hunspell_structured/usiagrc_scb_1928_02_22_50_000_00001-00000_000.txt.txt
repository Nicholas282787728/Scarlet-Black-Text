Tseng Says Divorce Recent In China;
Depend On Love In Marriage As We Do

“China never the word 'ilivorce' unr
til about iiiteen years ago," asscrtcd
Raymond Tseng at a meeting at the
Cosmopolital club in the Y. W. rooms
Tuesday night. ”A boy and a girl may
be totally unknown to each other be-
fore marriage, blit alter they are mar-
ried they love each other. The Chin.
ese depend on love in marriage just
{is you do.

“If a husband dislikes his witc. he
runs away or hills himselt; ii a wile
dislikes her husband, she has to suf-
fer.

“We Chinese boys don’t know what
a moonlight walk is,” said Mr. Tseog.
“We seldom talk to a girl. The par
ents arrange the marriage or their
son by using an old woman as
middle man, She goes to the parents
of the chosen girl, and atter much
iiattery and discussion, gets their con-
sent."

Tolls Soiolllisfs of Manila Structure;
Lnllmirclior Wakes ['lllm'tifonli,

"The linking oi Cliluroforlrl" was
demonstrated by Kenneth Longnceker
ﬂllr “Atomic Structure" was discussed
by Grant Smith at a Science club
meeting in man- hall Monday night.

Mr. Longnockcr made chlarniorm
by limiting acetone and bleaching
powder in a llask ’l‘lle chlorotorm
passed on and was collected in oily
drops at the bottom or a beaker or ice
water.

“Chloroiorm can be prepared in any
industry whcrc there is :ul-eVCeSS ot
chloriuc." llr. Lougnccirer sai "It
is llscd as an anesthetic, a preserra~
tive and a solvent."

iir. Smith traced the
atomic theories lrom the days
Democritus who thought that “the
only ting things are atoms and
spaceinll else is mere opinion;' and
that "the soul consists of smooth
round atoms." ‘

Mr, Smith discussed the Bohr atom
at modern science, using the hydro-
gen atom as an example, The electron
and the proton oi the hydrogen atom
are like the sun and the earth in their
relation to each other, he said; [lore
haps the electron ls only it whirlpool
that can he transformer] into energy.

“The hydrogen atom is like a series
or concentric racertracks, with fences
in between," Mr. Smith said. “When
the electron iumps over the tence
from on track into another, it makes
a light. This accounts for the many
dark lines in hydrogen spectrum."
