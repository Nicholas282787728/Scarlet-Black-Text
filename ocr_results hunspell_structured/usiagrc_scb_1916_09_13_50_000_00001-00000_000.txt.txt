men in both Iowa Wesleyan College
and the University oi Indians. She
held the position ‘at Indiana ior three
years beiore entering upon her year
oi study at Columbia University. In
both positions she was remarkably
successiul and her work in these two
institutions gives promise oi better-
things in Grinnell.

She has the appearance and manner-
or one who is accustomed to judge and
manage people and iii conversation is
a pleasing and interesting talltcr. The
Crinncll women who have met and
talked with her are practically nuani—
mous in expressing their approval and

Last year the old inshioned

Owing to the heaviest registration
oi girls in the history oi Grinuell, the
College has purchased the residence oii
Dr P. E. Somers, directly west oi the
Associations Building, and is using it
as an addition to the Quadrangle, har-
ing iitted it out tor the accommoda-
tion oi twenty—two girls. At present
every room is occupied, and elltrztucei
applications are hciiig reiiised daily
at the College etiicc because oi a,
iscarctty oi rooms. Until iurther ar—
i-angemcnts are completed, applicants
\vlll’ undoubtedly iind it diiiieult to se-
cure roonis within the city.

There is also an increase in are
number oi men in the Freshman class,|
but because oi the iact that all thel
ineir room are in pr 'ZtLe houses, they;
have experienced no such diilieulty as
the girls.

As usual, many upper clossnieu have
tailed to return, although a larger pcr
ccntage are here than in man. rest
vious years. The largest number havci
probably dropped out oi the Sopllm
more clas, and the least out oi tllei
Seniors. The number or 'l7—el's willl
undoubtedly be considerably over it,
hundred at graduation time. The Jun»
iors have returned in good loicc, ‘

Sevcral men, including l\\'0 or tlrice
gridiron stars, iiiembc .- oi the Nations

they will be able to obtain rcioasc "

occupy on their arrival.

Among the Freshmen are many men

stars have already registered, and are
an more are expected in the near iii-
