CBS reinvigorates
Black History Month

By MARCUS EAGAN

Even though Iowa ranks in the top 10 whitest stares, accord
ing to the US census, Concerned Black Students (CBS) are co-
ordinating the effort to commemorate this year's Black History
Month.

Grinnell College’s history of multi-cultural awareness and
social activism attracted some of CBS’s current leaders to the
college, but they believe that the student body needs to re focus
on multiculturalism. To re- -establish the schools cognizance of
issues long— plaguing Black America, CBS plans to screen iilms
to contextuallze blacks at Grinnell and bring up discussion

“This month we just want to make the campus and the stun
dent body at-large more aware of, essentially, [issues] that pertain
to blacks,” said JarrettJoubert’12, a board member of CBS. "This
week, and every week this month, we're showing a ﬁlm that has
had some inﬂuence on Blacks in general."

- Last Monday's ﬁlm of choice, “Bamboozled,” known for its
controversy, did not attract many students. In fact, less than 10
students, mostly CBS members, showed up for the eventJoubert
attributes the low turnout to last minute scheduling change, and
believes attendance can spike.

“Bamboozled” (2000), a ﬁlm written and directed by Spike
Lee satirizes the role of blacks in the modern—day entértalnment
industry, equating today’s actors to the actors in minstrel shows
of the nineteenth cen

Following the ﬁlm’s showing, Professor Teri Geller of the
English Department led a discussion on the ﬁlm and its larger,
social implications. The facultysled discussion is a crucial come
ponent of CES's agenda this Black History Month,

"What we want to do this year, in particular, is help students
understand and establish new goals for CBS—develop [all] stu-
dents intellectually, professionally and culturally," said Charisma
Montfort 11, a board member. [Following] every ﬁlm a profes-
sor is going to come in and lea_d a discussion.

The ﬁlm series continues on Tuesday with Amistad" at 4: 30
in ARH 102, “Daughters ofthe Dusk,” Feb. 20 at 4: 30 in Drake
Library and ﬁnishes with the biopic “Malcolm x’ by Spike Lee
on Feb 24 at4: 30 in ARH 102.

During Black HistoryMonth in 1977, CBS‘helped bring Gil
Scort- Heron to the campus, but in recent years the organization‘ s
potency in commemorating Black History Month decreased
over the years, according to some membersThe films this month
indicate CBS’s return to on active role in Black History Month
of the Grinnell educational community.

“Compared to my ﬁrst two years on campus, this is theinost
CBS has done for Black History Month," said Jerl Fields ’1].

Fields donned a CBS Black History Month (sshirr from the
1960s,which said “Civil Rights" on the front and “Time is runs
ning out.. ." on the back.

This February, CBS goes beyond the him reel to commemo-
rate this year’s Black History Month, and works in conjunction

with the Asian Student Union (ASU) to reach the Grinnell stut :

dent body this year.

On the last day of the month, CBS in conjunction with the
African Student Union (ASU) scheduled to host a potluck in
IRC 209, in the Multicultural Suitcsi joubert encourages all
members of the community to come, bring a dish and learn
about black heritage.

“While the event will be fun and a time to socialize,"]oubert
said, “it will also be a time to reﬂect on the month and outline
CBS and ASU's visions for future Black History Months on
campus." _

Celebrating Black History adends past CBS's effort, this
February. Feb, 15 there will be an exhibit shown in Faulconer
Gallery at noon,on Feb. 18 the gallery’s curator,Tilly Woodward,
will host a talk in the gallery at 7 pm.

Athletic center construction 'On time

Ev MATFHEWBACHTELL

After months of dedicated effort, the end of the Athletics
Centers construction is in sight as the building progresses
right on schedule

“We are very fortunate' in that we’ve done enough recent
building that we have a very experienced group of people on
campus in facilities management," said vice President for In
stitutional Planning Marci Sorter.

Enough of the exterior work of both the Natatorlum and.

the field house was completed that the builders could seal
them off and continue working inside when the bad weather
set in.

"So rm not surprised that we’re doing well. 1 really had
a lot of conﬁdence, going into the project, in our team," said
Sortor.

Phase II includes a Natatorium and a field house. The
Natatorium will house a SOsmeter pool, which can simultaner
ously accommodate diving practice, the swim team, and well-
ness courses, team and community locker rooms, a multi-pur-
pose dance studio and a climbing wall. The field house will
hold an National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
regllation track, tennis courts and the Physical Education
faculty ofﬁces.

“When ﬁnished we’ll have some of the finest facilities, not

only for athletics, but also for recreation and sports in general,
as far as‘ the country is concerned, 'Dltecmi of Athletics Greg
Wallace said.

Phase II is the ﬁnal step in the 2000 Campus Plan to ex»
pand and improve the college's facilities. It was to.cost 572
million, and is currently running under-budget. When bud-_
gerary constraints brought up liquidity concerns with the proj—
ect, the college ﬂoated at bond to meet costs. ,

The Athletics Center will open in August, ready for use
next semester. It will more comprehensively meet the needs of
Grinnell athletics than the current facility, the Physical Educ
cation Complex (PEC), which has recently been having struc-
tural dlﬁ‘ltuliiesﬂ roof support beam in the south part of the
building cracked, necessitating its immediate repair. After the
opening of the new center, the PEC will no longer be in use.

“The PEC will be boarded up until sometime in the future
when it will be torn down,’ said Associate Professor of Physi-
cal Education SFS Dee Fairchild.

Phase 11 will be the last major construction project until
the effects of the recession are past, and the college has paid
ottthe debts incurred by the bond. Future projects, such as the
wind nirbines,will be put offuntil the College's capital reserye
is sufficiently ieeoveied.
