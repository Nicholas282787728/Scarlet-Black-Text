ize in time to interfere with the
general reception in the evening.
At eight o'clock the students bee
gan to assemble in the Rand gym.

 

nasium and soon the spacious EX'
ercise room was thronged with
students. faculty. alumni and
triends of the college. As usual,
the old boys accompanied the new
girls, and the old girls the new
boys, and this. with tliehelp of the
“1 ami; who are you?" cards.

LAKE GENEVA CONFERENCES.

Men's Conference.

Ono rarely ﬁiitls a more genu—
inely. spiritually helpful ntmos»
phere than exists arountl the Gene
eva camp at such a time as the
conference of the Young Men’s
CliristianAssoctation. Diiringtlic
last days of June. over ﬁve litinr
drcd young men from thc middle
west came together at the camp

on Lake Geneva to discuss plans
of work in their colleges for the
coming year, The ciiiet features
of the program were the morning
conferences relative to the differ
eut phases of the association
work anti the addresses by those
experienced in that work. The
afternoons were given exclusively
to recreation and private confer»
ences. The Life Work meetings
on the lake front were the means
of very forcibly placing before the
men their position in lilo tvllh re
gard to those of lesser acquire
ments in the knowledge of the
Truth. Some or these evening
meetings were addressed by
Messrs, Mott. Colton, spear and
Harry Monroe. ofthe Paciﬁc Gar-
den Mission.
