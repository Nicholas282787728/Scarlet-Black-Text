A Warning And A Challenge

It does not Isound very hard to call for the rejection
of “high consumption, leisure and security” as goals of
Americans as Dr. Bowen did last night.

To an unthinking audience the words might be called
ypical" of an address given by a college president.

But what the plea reallyamounts to is a complete
turningeaway from America as we know it today. This is
El staggering proposition.

(

By’ calling fl)!" a new directing of our resources/ and
talent, Dr. Bowen was saying that America has gone be-i
j nd the stage ofradolescence and now must assume its
duties as an adult or be destroyed in a terrible struggle.

.While he was critical of American materialism and

“freshmen Old Glory Ends Here"

Ed. note. Tile lollowing is a reprint or an editor-int which
appeared in the Scarlet and Black in the Sept. 18, 1959, issue.
While the exact percentage points vary ironi ye‘ar‘ to year, we
reel that the essence of the editorial is still well taken and will
he in years toécome. ~

For the l‘irst time in several years there was little
mention of grades, test scores and “the smartest class yet
to enter Grillnell" at the mass meeting of freshmen

However, there was a red ing of the record and as
usual the stati. ics were supel inlly impre. ive.

Almost one- ifth of the freshmen held class offices ill
.high school. Half of them participated ill dramatics, debate
and oratory. Hall; of them were either editor or business
,mallager of one of their higll school publications. Seventy
(of the men received athletic letter awards in high school.
The freshmen, according to Preident Bowen’s statistics,
were “an active, intelligent, alert group of students \litll
much initiative.”

Unfortunately, very little at Grinllell is done by mas.

‘statistic's. Progress, achievement and contribution is made
lby students and faculty working together and independen
ly to bring about a thousand or more desired ends and
goals. < “
l Perhaps we can, along with President Bowen, respect
the statistics for. hat they are and congratulate the fresh
‘men on their past record. The freshmen can certainly be
proud‘ of their record. But as they will soon learn' if they
have not already done so, the college soon grous tired of
statistics and asks for proof of the alertness and initiative
of the new students.

President Bowen expressed the situation, “Gi‘innell is
no country club. There will be hard work. There will zbe
times of frustration and discouragement when the students
(are fed up with the work. But advice and help on an adult-
to-adult level is plentiful, and there is no college which al-
lows greater freedom. in which the student can solve his
problems and express himself and his ambition.” '

‘ As a result of experience we must agree. Now it is all
up to the freshmen.

\

But, as he makes clear, America is only as good as its
people and their goals and concern In this time of dras-
tic change and challenge, America s only as good as its
young people.

What Dr, Bowen said was not so much a speech of
voids and dreams as a warning and a challenge. It is e.
[reddent that we, the students of America and the free
world, heed the warning-and take the challenge.

, «Disarmament

If the disarmament controversy arises this year at
innell- as it did last spring, the students and facility
l,be involved in discussion and action concerning one

of the most important issues of our time.

We have supported and will continue to support allyl

positive action taken by students and faculty to provide
abetter understanding of the problem,

We will not support any ’movement by any group
minority or majority to push a voluntary ROTC program
out of Grinnell. We fail to see this as a necessary or pro-
gressive step. We would also question the merits of such
stupid stunts 'as demanding “equal time" on a local ra-
dio station to denounce “Poppy Day.”

If any group of students at Grinnell hopes to make
some positive contribution toward disarmament and world
peace, they must have organization and purpose. They must
have a planned program which will alert people’to the
issues. They can best achieve these things by becoming a
part of some national or inter-national organization with
the same goals and ideals.

A‘Tradilion Wllrih Preserving .

Sometime this fall Blair hall, or “the bookstore," will

torn down to make room for, landscaping and other
cilities which will give Grinnell one of the most beauti-
l and modern “front doors" of any college in America.

be

Since we have been at Grinncllwve have seen three
old, outdated buildill fall. We have watched the con-
struction of a modern library and a new dormitory. Day
by day we are watching the new fine arts building rise.

Grinllell has not only kept pace in the development
of new and modern facilities to match its academic pro-
gress but 1 s set a precedent in the development and ex-
pansion of its physical plant.

There are many people who have had some part in
this progress. We could not begin to name them. But we
can he glad that there are such people who help to make
our lives as, students more enjoyable and rewarding.

It is perhaps collegiate to criticize tradition. Yet here
in Grinnell’s constant striving for a better school, we find
a tradition which stands above any juvenile criticism and
which we can and must help preserve
