Gl‘innell unleashed a powerful running offense and
combined this with an extremely stout defense to gain vicA

tol‘y over Laytrence here las

t Saturday, 25-8, in the Pio-

neers’ opening game of the 1958 football season.

Throughout most of the
moved the ball at will, behind
tailback John Copeland, the
powerful plunges of sophomore
fullback. Jim Lowry, and fine
offensive blocking.

Neither team scored in the
ﬁrst period. A pass intercep-
tion by Ernie Rutherford stop~
ped a weak Lawrence drive,
immediately after which Jim
Schulze intercepted} Grinnell
Pm to even matters. Law-
rence, however, could do noth-
ing with the hall and was
forced to punt. The ball then
rested on the Pioneer 49 when
the quarter ended.

The start of the second quar-
ter marked the shift of Grin-
nell’s offensive machinery into
high gear. The Pioneers drove
in- businesslike manner for the
in al touchdown in lz plays,
capped by Copeland’s one-yard
skirt of left end. The Pioneers
elected to kick, and Copeland
split the uprights, giving Grin-
nell a 7—0 lead.

Lawrence was forced to punt,
four plays after receiving the
Grinnell kickoff. Grinnell then
marched for 31 successive yards,
culminated by Lawry’s plunge
for the touchdown from the
seven yard line, carrying two
Lawrence tacklers along with
him. Copeland’s try for the ex-
tra point failed. Lawrence again
could not move the ball after
receiving the kickoff, and was
forced to kick. Grinnell moved
the ball 16 yards before the first
half expired.

The Pioneers immediately
took up where they lo‘tt off at
the beginning of the third
quarter. After receiving the
kick on their own 39, they
marched ior three successive

the elusive running of senior

first downs to the Lawrence 19.
Copeland then carried the ball
to the six. Lowry, on two
successive plunges, pushed the
ball to the one, and Copeland
carried for a touchdown lrom
there. The kick for the con.
version attempt was no good.

Late in the third quarter,
Grinnell started another drive
rolling, this time from their own
,32. Grinnell earned five succes-
sive first downs, rolling to the
Lawrence five, when the quar-

ter endedr Lowry then ran over
from the three. to Score the Pio-
neers’ final touchdown, The extra
point attempt failed.

The Lawrence gridders then
started their first real offensive
of the game, after receiving the
kick on their own 32. Unable to
move through the solid Pioneer
line, they took to the air, be-
hind the passing arm of Law-l’
rence quartenback Schulze.
Schulze completed a aseyard
pass to halfback Tom Gallcndin,
[allowed by a lﬁsyard toss to full- I

back Gary Scovel.

Mulford then carried to the

Pioneer four, [allowed by it
pitcllout to Gallendjn who

skirted left end for Lawrence's
lonc touchdown. A similar
play allowed Galleildin to pick
up two points after the touclr
down. Neither team could store

the game,

Ripon Is Nexi
For‘ Pioneers

Bob Peterson nervously paced
the training room floor, “We
realize that Ripon has a very
fine team, has a great deal of
backfield speed, plenty of re
serve strength."

“Pete” leaves for Ripon, Wis.
this evening after dinner. The
Pioneers second football game
will be played under the lights
tomorrow night at 7:30.

Ripon was upset last week
in Cedar Rapids by a really
determined Coe squad, losing
its first game in eleven.

“We've got our work cut out

for us." cautioned Peterson,
“We’re going to have a rough go
of it We aren’t going to be able
to make ten yards at every
chance as we did last wee ."

forced to the sidelines last week,
remain question marks. ”John

riitscli has only 20 players
to work ’with, but he said
that the squad had shown
better than average speed and
size. He felt that he had
cnough solid performers for
one capable team and that it
all the men staycd out (ﬁve
candidates h a v c withdrawn
from the team) and developed
as '5 expected, the present
crop oi freshmen will be able
to bolster any weaknesses in
the varsity which might de—
velop when this year’s senior
footballers depart. The back—
ﬁeld is particularly strong,
with eight men trying out.
