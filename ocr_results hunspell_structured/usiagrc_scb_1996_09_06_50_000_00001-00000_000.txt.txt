Pranksters wreak havoc on construction site

BY MICHELE HOST
Staff Writer

Catastrophe nearly marred
New Student Days on Tuesday, Au
gust 22, when two unidentified indie
viduals broke into the Fine Arts
Building construction site and began
driving Caterpillars belonging to
CPMl Construction.

Grinnell Police were driving
on Highway Six late on Tuesday
night when they noticed that two of
the Caterpi liars were moving. Tire
officers stopped their vehicle and
Walked towards the construction
zone waving ﬂashlights. and the per-
petrators fled. While the machines
were not damaged, damage was done
to the gate. More important was the
damage which could have befallen
the perpetrators As Jan Czechowski,
chairman ofthe building committee.
said this week, “If that equipment
had fallen into a hole someone would
be dead. It’s really dangerous."

This incident was followed by
a lesser altercation on Sunday night,

when an unidentified individual was
caught taking part ofthe fcnce down.
When startled. he ran away, leavi g
behind one of the “Men Working"
signs

While the incidents last week
ended without serious harm, ques-
tions rctnain regarding the lack of
security in the Fine Arts Building
construction area According to Tom
Cindy, Dean for StudentAffairs, the
Fine Arts Building construction is a
“traffic zonc" due to its location be»
tween campus and State Street Sta-
tion. Yet prior to this week only the
night watchman had been patrolling
the area. This coverage was ex-
tremely sporadic because of the
amount of area the night watchman
must patrol each ‘night. A security
officer from Wells Fargo has now
been hired to patrol the area.

Several different reasons have
been given fat the college‘s initial
reluctance to hire additional security,
Mr, Czechowski explains that the
lack ofadditioiiat security for the site
was partially a function of trust. He
says that while "there is always a

concern that someone will break in
and fool around, there was a hope
that it wouldn’t happen.”

General explanations are also
being given for the security prob
lems Mark Godar, Director ofFa-
ciiities Management. said that the
Fine Arts construction site is a “tough
area" to patrol due to its location on
Highway Six. Mr. Czechowski
added that the site itselfis more dife
ﬁciilt to control than other sites, such
as the Science Building construction,
because it is “a lot tnore open and
exposed [than the Science Building]
and doesn’t cover a lot of ground."
The Fine Arts Building construction
is also problematic “because there
has to be multiple access; parts ofthe
fence have to be open and closed,"
said Mr. Czechowski. '

In addition to hiring a security
guard, Grinnell has taken other steps
to keep the construction site safe.
More Signs and lights have been
added to the area. and the college is
publicizing the immense amount of
danger involved with playing in the
construction zone.

Grinnell students will soon
have a vastly improved center for
fine arts activities and classes. Con-
struction crews are already working
on a major addition to and renova-
tion of the existing Fine Arts Build-
ing. Completion of the addition is
proyccted for December 1997, and
completion ofthe renovation for De-
cember 1998. According to Jan
Czechowski, professor of theatre aiid
member of the planning committee,
construction is running on schedule.

Tire current Fine Arts Building
was constructed in the early 1960's,
reﬂecting in its architecture both the
aesthetics and demands of the time.

' Yet increased participation in art and

music since that time means that cur-
rent Grinnell students and faculty
involved in the arts cannot help but
feel the squeeze ofinadequate space
Studios are small and crowded,
music students vie anxiously for
times to practice their instruments in
the handful of practice rooms avail~
able, and many fine arts activities
must seek adequate practice, recital
and gallery space elsewhere.
Numerous changes embodied
in tile addition ztnd renovation will
allow tltc college‘s many arts activi-
ties to take place under one roof,
Plans for new and improved space
were discussed nearly a decade ago,
according to CZCCl’iOWSkL The dc—
finttivc plnnnrnghas been in progress
since 1992 under the direction of a

committee that is composed of
people from all areas ofthe ﬁne arts
at Grinnell.

Cesar Pelli & Associates, a
world-famous architecture firm
based in New Haven, designed the
addition and renovation. The ﬁrm
has done many university and col-
lege projects and “have been just
great to work with," reports
Czechowski. Amodel ofthe plan can
cun’ently be seen In the lobby ofthe
Fine Arts Building. The major
amount of work consists ofthe con-
struction of the four wings — the-
atre, music, art and gallery * ofthe
new addition. When this addition is
complete, the renovation of the ex—
isting building will begin.

Renovation ofRoberts Theatre
will commence in June 1997 and is
expected to be complete in Decem-
ber 1997. While Roberts is reno»
vatcd, till theatre performances Will
take place in the small, black box
ArenaThcarre, “We’ll be doing very
interesting but Obviously not very
large production," Mr. Cxechowski
commented. The new Roberts The-
atrc Will have a completely different
support space in the basement. as
well as rr new ﬂoor tor the stage that
is more compatible for dance. All
electrical and sound equipment will
also be improved, and new structures
for hanging scenery will be installed
over the stage.

The rest of the cttrrent Fine
Arts Building will be entirely relics

space planned for the whole second

Quad worker, self-serve is difficult
to work because the lines are so slow
and long. It‘s also a waste of food.
Students take too much food and then
don’t eat it all," said All Kaplan ‘99.

Head ofDll-iing Services Dave
McConnell had an answer to these
concerns. He pointed out that din—
ing hall lines are always longerat the
beginning ofthe school year. and that
“after familiarization with the sys-
tem, students Will begin to self-se-
lect the amount of food they eat,"
thus eliminating the problem ofwast-
ing food. McConnell is also adamant
that student dining ital] Jobs are not
being lost, while stating that not once
during the ‘9595 school year were
all possible Quad and Cowlcs posi-
tions ﬁlled.

In addition to the self-serve
line, Dining Services has provided
both dining halls with a dell bar, a
juice bar and the long awaited arrival
of chocolate milk. Students have

voiced considerable approval of these
additions. “I‘m glad to see Lhey (Din-
ing Services) are not afraid to try new
things and make changes,” cements
senior Charlie Clark.
, Two more positive but not
widely publicized changes have been
made exclusively to Quad. Not only
is Quad open 15 minutes longer on
weekday evenings, extending its
hours to 4:30-6:00, but the dining hall
also reopens its deli bar from 2:00 to
4:00 in the afternoon to accommo-
date students with busy schedules
who want to use those hours to grab
an early dinner or late lunch,
McConnell assures students
that there are yet more changes to
come. Grinnellians can look forward
to the addition of a pasta bar, a po-
tato bar and a low fat bar, which will
operate on a rotating schedule. “Our
goal.” he stated, “is to try to get these
up and running by the end of tall
break."
