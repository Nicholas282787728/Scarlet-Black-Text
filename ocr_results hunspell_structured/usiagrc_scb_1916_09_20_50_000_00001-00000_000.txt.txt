“Your presence at the Vcspcr sel'»

The speaker laid gicat emphasis on
consistent attendance at these SCX‘V

by stating that they involve me of
the greatest words of the world in
the liyniils, the liiicst of music, and a
brief talk, all concentrated on a in e

being prepared to meet the varsity
either the latter part of this week or
the first of next week. Hoyt is builds

stiff opposition to the varsity.

One or the strongest backfield men

The struggle for places on Grim
:lcll's football team has begun in car a
est during the last few days, and it is
hoped that by the time we meet Le<
antler Clark here a week from next
Saturday, Grinnell will iie represented
by a uuining eleven. Daily signal
practice is now being done on hard
Field by two squads and the coach is
centering his attention on filling holes
lcit vacant by McLal'Ch, Parker, Lit-
ilc, sinallcy, Dohlhlhn, and other men
that have not yet rclur ted.

nay Bolihnan arrived in Grinnell
yesterday, biit it is doubtful whether
he will remain. All effort is being
made to have him stay, because he is
thc only letter man at end that has
come back yet. it Bohlman remains,
McAlmon will have less tumble in fill-
ing up the vacancies at end, especially
with Schultz going in fine form. Both‘
Raffety and Ralph Hoyt are also work—
ing hard in order to play at the wings.

McAlmon is woiklng mostly toward
filling up holes at guard and tackle.
Giuglcs, who played at guard and
tackle last year, is being used at coir
tcr. McLaren and siuallcy probably
will not return from the ifcxican hor—
der until winter. Both these men were
walls of defense and offense on the
line Martin, :\IC:\IlIlDll, iiillcrd and
w s are all being tried at guard.
wii s is also being shifted into left
tackle, as smith is on the iiiiured list
with a broken hand iihich \lill keep
him from the game for several weeks.
Osgood will take care of the other
tackle, with "Dad" Hoyt as a reserve.
Hoyt has not been able to round into
the best of condition and it will take
sevcral weeks before he can get into
the do he had lustyear. The other
promising line men are grown, Stod-
dard, itciinedi, and Braey nracy had
a piece of l s ear chipped off early
this week, and has not since been ,
a suit.

The hackiitld looks good at this pe-
riod uith Bariett, it it, Augustine,
Fleck and Grant all going good, and
with Mom, Day, Sibley, and A. Miller
hot on their trail irir icglllar posi-
tious. Barrett and Augustine are being
played at half with Grant or Fleck at
full, although :‘illgllsllllc and Flock
may be shifted Ill positions occasion-
allin

Augustine will do the pliiitiiig again
this year w it did \ as iiiidcrstlidy

been doing work of a \ ' ' ‘ 'nd na-
ture in picking forward p out of

most of the passing, and Augustine

Searccly til-o wcclts separate us from
