‘l. that fried chicken was the

est meal served so far. Cheese-

urgers also ranked high on
a list. All 17 had something
bed to say about Saga while
my a few found anything
'rong.

Eob Weitzinan says that he
ots “less meals because I cat
are at the meals 1 go to,” He
lent on to say that he had
.lVen up breakfast and dinner,
iut only because he’s trying to

weight. However, he did

that he might "stop in
rice in awhile for six or seven
losses of orange juice. 1 love
heir orange juice.”

“I think people should get
more the iirst time
through the line," Weitzman
added. “I got —blcssed tired
or walking back tor my six
elieeseburgers today."

One other thing that Weitz-
an said was that “smiling Bob
isher should stop smiling be.-
.orc 9 in the morning. People
iust don't smile that early."
Ginny Okubo and'Al Spicler
oth agree that Saga has been

great improvement over the
ast system. Ginny has been
ost favorably impressed with
he improvement of the roast

And Saga is bound to serve a
bad one occasionally. But the
yen] minuteness of many of the
changes (cg, the sausages tor
Sunday breakfast) only serves
to point up the drcadtul shah»
-iness of the old days. _
Saga is‘a big organization,
we are told, and buys its
food in huge lots, .and can

undoubtedly true. But it was

scraping by the Saga staff, their
product is a good one, and they
need not grovcl to gain student
rcspect. We ﬁnd it dinicult to

Hunk and the boys . . This
is a small complaint,
whispered, mind you. We love
you, Hunk. Really.

And besides, imagine the

can remember when they used

personnel give a damn about
the students and their opin-
ions," said Spieler.

Kathy Farmers main
ment was ‘Wow, on to the
Scales." This seems to be the
general opinion. A number at
students are beginning to wore
ry about their weight problem
Sally williams commented, “I've
gained, i really have." Jim Ja

cobson is also having a weight1

problem and he hopes that it
won’t affect his swimming.

Jacobson also said that
was happy over the tact that
the Saga management “is hand-
ing over backward
everyone." He did have

was that the conce is

Both agreed that the toad is
a great improvement and
they too are worried about
their weight problem.
