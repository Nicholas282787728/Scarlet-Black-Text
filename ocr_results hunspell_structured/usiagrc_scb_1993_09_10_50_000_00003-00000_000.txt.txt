anMrrhing
and Crunching

By Lisa Sehanen

AFTER 3 hard day of classes, a
game of frisbee, anda nap under a
leafy tree, your stomach is screamr
ing for food, begging for a few
morselsof substantial nourishment.
In the search for a cure to the
dreaded “munchies," you dash off
tothencarestdininghallﬂousutnd
in line for an eternity, pick up a
ﬂooded tray, and stareattheselcc-
tion of gourmetentrees before you.
Ah, shriveled cabbage, and that
brown mush thereiwould that be
last night‘s turkey loaf! Your
stomach's salvation will haveto be
found elsewhere.

Whatdoyoudotoavoidblow-
ing another ten bucks on a pizza or
losing yourquarters to the vending
machine demon later that night?
Many Grinnellians rely upon the
seasonings and selections on the
salad bar to embellish theirentrees
orcreateedtbleconcocttons of their
own. Add a little ketchup and a
dash of chili powder to dtat pctIir
fied turkey loaf, and you might
have a scrumptious meal ahead of
you. Or. you might grab a bowl of
your favorite cereal, throw in some
peanutbutter,a little honey. . .who
knows what you might come up
with? Perhaps these suggestions
sound less than appetizing to you.
Well, the 5&8 would like to hear
about your dining hall recipes.

Public Journal: First Entry

T Athanatos

T is absurd to critictze another's
Ilife, without first having exam

tncd detailed and extensrve in
formation concerning this life itself.
To put it in simpler terms, I modify
Solon's “don’t call anybody happy
before his end," With a don't call
anybody wrong before you know his
beginning. The significance of such
a siatementcould be hastily doubted
(especially by those whom it is ad-
dressed to) butthe truth is that in this
campus, nothing is more relevant.

Thewholefunction ofthisschool
is structured around the supposition
that all the members of the campus
community are people characterized
by rcsponsibi ltty towards themselves.
Both professors and students are
proud to identify ihemselvesas mem-
bers of an academic Community (if
not the Academia in general). By
acknowledging this they understand
themselves to be individuals who
possess an intellectual self; a self
which exists only by virtue of the
analytic and synthetic capacity of the
individual. In short, most people on
this campus are suppored to be indi
viduals with the ability to respect
themselves, for they have the capac-
ity to know themselves.

Why am I writing all this? Be
cause I see an immediate connection

with the above normative statement
and the academic identity of this col-
lege. Students seem to take pleasure
(and a fair amountof pride) in tnlclr
feciltaflzing their days away, while
professors —attd this is common
knowledgci have no reservation in
adapting theirbehavtorand approach
towards students at will. And I have
noinitial objection to this (forifldid,
I would be contradicting my opening
statement). The point] wish to make
is that while all these people think
that they're only doing their job (pro-
fessors evaluating students and stur
dents evaluating their peers) what
they really are doing is engaging in
intellectually worthless evaluations
of other people.

When a professor thinks that this
or that student is a spoiled rich kid or
justan adolescentwhoisgoing through
his reactionary stage; when a student
calls another student a narrow-
mindcdncss conservative or a messed
up pseudorhippyish liberal; all that
these people are doing is engaging in
disapproval-loaded evaluations that
cannot hold any validity outside their
own systems. Theproblem ihatoccurs
is that these people (and alas they are
the majority) live in an illusion oftheir
own intellectual maturity, and they
also show and profess disrespect for
others. I will not fall into my own u-ap
by evaluating these people single-

handedly; I will only argue that these
people cannot be called intellectually
mature and cannot be respected for
their insight and education, because
drey do not respect themselves. One
cannot have respect for himself when
he untnvitedly criticizes and [CJOCIS

others, for if one has respect for his
own intellectual world, he ought to
understandthatiheonlywaythtsworld
could make sense as a valid entity, is
by respecting (or rather, by treasuring)
the validity and authority of odter
people’s choices.

Solutions to Over—
crowding Problems

By Howard B. Horn

S many of you have noticed
A by the long lines at Cowles
and Quad or the 45 minute
wait to use theshower, Grinnell has a
problem with overcrowdingln order
to put all the new students some-
where, dtecollege has added an extra
bed to all first year triples, converted
many pit lounges into rooms, and
changed all the PDR rooms in Cowles
to freshman quarters.

Grinnellnow hasadifferentfeel.
Gone are the days of Read Pit parties
and quiet dinners with some friends.

As a public service, I offer the
school my thoughts on alternative
housing for students.

Ham's. Let’s be honest: most
students don’t like Harris. The con
cert hall can be split into two floors
with atleasteightdeeentsized rooms
on each floor. One lucky Ham's resi-
dent will get the disco ball in his or
her room. (Thanks Glade, for this
one.)

Addanorherﬂoor iaNorris. You
may not know this. but some time
ago. the college added a floor to
Norris. Why not add another? Oh
yeah, because no one wants to live
there. Forget I mentioned it.

Steiner. Steiner looks too much
like a residence, and not like a class-
room building. All that's missing is a
few beds. Thinkofall the desk space!
