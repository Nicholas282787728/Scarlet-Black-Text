Can We Keep H? - -

The best evidence we have had of late, of
increasing campus spirit, even during the
unnaturally trying strains of wartime, has
been shown by the fine attitude most stu—
dents assumed toward the recent restric—
tion of smoking in the dining room. Most
of us seemed to realize that the penalty was
imposed because of our own carelessness,
and were quite glad to co-operate with col—
lege authorities.

The future of dining room smokes now
rests entirely in the hands of the students
The administration has seen fit to give us
another try at it, and we will be the only
ones responsible in case a penalty is again
imposed Since our next restriction will
stop smoking f01 a month, it is probable
that most of us will be willing to do 0111
best to avoid bulning the table linen

Even during peace time such plactices
should not be puisued, and would undoubt-
edly not be tolelated by college autllo1ities.
But now, with table linen impossibly hard
to obtain, the least we can do is watch
ourselves a little closer, and try just a bit
harder to get the cigarettes clear to the
ash tlays before flicking off ashes or put-
ting it out. This certainly isn’t too much
to expect from the students

No leal complaints wele turned in d111~
ing the ten days of ollr recent lestriction,
which would seem to indicate that the
students ale willing to do their best in

order to keep their right to smoke in the
dining room.

If there are constant recurrences of
cigarette mishaps, however, it might mean
that the privilege would be taken away
from us for an even longer-time than last,
perhaps pelmanently. Certainly no student
would wittingly be responsible for such
a thing.

We should do all we can now by taking
better note of ourselves, and avoid all misAl
haps, thus eliminating all the worry about
a “next time."

Renaissance

In the past two weeks the campus has
blossomed with a variety of multi-colored
posters and placards that have brightened
the view. Energetic groups meet after
meals and then hurry off on urgent mis—
sions. Each day means some new stunt.
In shalt, the physical aspects of the Student
Council election have transformed the col-
lege

Awakening from its winter lethargy,
the student body has taken a great deal
of interest 1'11 the campaigllimore interest,
probably, than has been shown in any other
campus event this year. Sincere efforts
are being made to study the qualifications
of the candidates. Active support of indis
vidual candidates by certain groups has
given more persons an active part in the
show.

Clearly illustrated this year is the new
unity that may be found in a small student
body. Because everyone knows everyone
else, consideration for personal feelings is
not disregarded. There are no characteiu
defaming whispering campaigns. Rathel,
the candidates have chosen to acceiltuate[
the positive i

All undeilying factor in the campaign
as impoltant as all the sound and fuly is
the sillceie good will among factions and
candidates as cont asted with the animos-
ities and tiivialities that clopped up in
last year’s battle. Friendships started in‘
the contestants’ prep year have stood the
strain of campaign competition.

Only when the delegates convene to-
morrow in ARH auditorium, will the full
strategy of the many campaigns become
apparent Completely unexpected things
may occu but when it is over the eight
losers will turn to the winners with sincere
congratulations

Dear Mom:

like yesterday. I am
still in college. Everything is
holding up pretty Well except
my bed and budget. The bottom:
fallen out of both.

Grinnell is a Very nice place.
Just as nice as it was last se-
mester.

But, Mom, that isn't what 1
am writing you about. 1 have a
favor to ask of you, Mom. Don‘t
think that 1 want to impose on
you, but would you please do me
this favor? All the rest of the
kids think 1 am kind of crazy
for asking you to do this, but
really 1 don't need a psychiatrist.
If it will inconvenience you too
much never mind. What I
wanted was that you please stop
sending me cigarettes.

1 guess you think rm suffer-
ing from delirium tremens. but
you see, there are several rea-
sons. In the first place, 1 have
given up cigarettes {or Lent. It's
good exercise for a person's will
power to restrain himself. It'd
help the shortage so much if
everybody gave up cigarettes for
six weeks.

In the second place, We can't
smoke in the dining room because
somebody bumt holes in the table
Just as well. . . 1 hate
in my pudding. But
