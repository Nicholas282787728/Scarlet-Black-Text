Fix-st step in the adjustment of
Grinnell college curriculum for
further participation in the war
effort iwas approved Monday
night by the faculty with the
addition of two new programs of
specialized study for women.

The first, planned for women
students entering college in the
future, is a two-year program to
prepare for immediate employ—
ment. The second is for women
now enrolled in a four»year
course who have met most of
their major requirements. and
will constitute a "war minor."
The two»years of college work
taken in the first program will
apply on a four—year course, if
the student later decides to com-
plete college work here, President
Samuel N. Stevens said yester—
day.

Preparation for seven types of
work is given in the bwwyear
courses. Pre-profesaionul work
will be given in physical therapy
and social work, and complete_
preparation for secretarial assist-
ants '11 civil service, laboratory
techn ians, recreational leaders,
engineering cadets, and school
teaching with a standard elemen—
tary certificate.

The engineering cadets. Stevens
explained, are women trained in
physics and mathematics who are
chosen for further trai ing by

Heal+h Check Plan

For January

No health check will he required
of students returning to campus
following the Christmas recess.
Dean Shelton L. Beatty an-
nounced last night. The plan
adopted last year has been
dropped due to the shortage of
doctors in Grinnell, the scattered
campus residences, and the high—
er standard of public health this
year.

However, parents of Grinnell
students will be asked to cooper-
ate in checking health of these
students before they return to
school, _Beatty said. Any student
who is ill or exposed to any ins
fection or contagion, especially
influenza, mumps, measles. or
any respiratory disease, should
secure from his family physician
a written statement that he is
in satisfactory and safe condition
to travel. to resume studies, and
to associate with others.

.A letter requesting such action
will be sent to parents during the
recess.

 

Jus’r To Prove

Meel’ Up Wil'h

BY
Candidate Samucl

/
A. Freedman

When old Bill Shakespeare gave
to the world his immortable
quote, “What's in a name?" li
tlc did he know that in the hec-
tic year of 1942, a class of offi-
cer candidates at Grinnell college
would provide the answer.

Those who believe that mere
coincidence is not mere coincie
dence, but the work of secret
forces in nature, better known as
the occult, may have some inter-
esting observations anent the re-
markable case in Room 533, Clark
hall, wherein Wililam Topp and
Douglas Bottom occupy quarters.
'. iese candidates apparently did
not quibble over their doubler
decked bunks, either. Topp is on
the bottom, and Bottom is on
the top, illustrating that old
army apliorism of "a place for
everything and everything in its
place."

One of the plethora of unusual
names to he found in company 0
is that of Jerry P. Bovine (pro-
nounoed just like Elsie, the glam»
orous Jersey) but he disavows

Charlie Chan

No’rhing in a Name

that in civil life he had anything
to do with the dair rig business.

And. for the special attention
of Robert Ripley, there's an hon-
est—to-goodncss Charlie Chan in
company C, a personable young
American of Oriental rlescent. To
the confusion of Capt. Merryman
and everyone else at the first
formation, Charlie not only bears
the name of his famous, if myth»
ical. namesake, but, in no uncer-
tain way, resembles him in
spcech, manner and wit,

straight out of the halls of
famc comes another delegation of
names Roblcy D. Evans is the
namesake of the American ad-
miral; Leonard J. Fausty is just
one 'y' away from the opera
character; and Edward Gatling.
jr s the namesake and distant
relative of the inventor of the
famous Gatling gun, one of the
earliest American rapid»fil’e arms.

Among the candidates is Wil—
liam Bakewell, veteran stage and
screen actor, and Richard Hep-
burn. brothcr of the motion p
turc star, Katharine Hepburn.

It's Only a Chance

House will surely be open by the
second semester."

The last barrier was removed
with the news that the over-
stuffed furniture, now stored in
Chicago, is being shipped to Grim
nell by truck sometime next
week. Repairs and redecoration
are completed, and hostess and

What's to stop us now?

Men May Join
Navy Reserves

Through Dra‘Fl

Governmenl’ Acl'ion Nol’
Considered 'reopening
cl reserves' >BeaHy

Partial explanation of the govern-
ment action of yesterday which
has been erroneously termed “the
re—Dpening of all reserves" was
offered this morning by Dean
Shelton L. Beatty after a tele
phone conversation with service
officers in Des Moines.

The understanding of the situ-
ation by those officers, based on

-Leleg‘rams from Washington, is as

follows:

Men not in reserves who vol-
unteer to their draft boards for
induction before Feb. 1' will be
consiriered by those selective serv
vice officials for prospective
membership in v-l, v.5, and v-7;
and preliminary papers for these
reserve branches can be sent by
these draft board officials to
navy headquarters in Des Moines
for further action.

No provision for ERG enlist
ment under , milar arrangements
with draft boards was made,
Beatty said.

“Everything still indicates all
men in ERG will be here until the
end of this semester, and some
of them Will lie here next Semcsr
tel'.

“Our present information con—
tinues to be that Navy ltescrves
will be in residence here next
semester as they have been to
date," the dean concluded.

267 Sludenls Purchased
Sugar. Coliee Alloimenrs

Two hundred sixty-seven college
students purchased their allot-
ments of sugar and coffee from
the college iood department Mon-
day ond Tuesday, Miss Nellie
Gleason. director of foods, are
nounced last night.

One pound of sugar and one-
hall pound of coffee were per-
mitted each student for use durr
ing the Christmas recess.

Stamps in the sugar ration
books for the current period have
been removed and books would

home communities. Miss Gleason
said.

Sievens Given Au+hori+y To Change
College Ser-Up l'F Necessary

President Samuel N. Stevens was empowered by action of the
board of trustees in its meeting Saturday morning to make
any changes in the curriculum or physical set-up of Grinnell
college to maintain "a free and independent program of ﬁber
al arts education" even though another unit for training of
service men be set up on the campus in the near future.

Such a unit is a distinct
probability, Stevens said this
morning, "It may be one ,of
three types of schools:

1. An extension of the pres-
ent AGO school.

2. An enlisted reserve corps
school offering a pragmm of in—
tonsive training specified by
War and Navy departments,

3. A specialists school for en-
listed or civilian personnel or
ganiced and administered by
the manpower commission.

Either of the latter two schools
would make use of the present
college faculty, Stevens said, and
would thus have a desirable sta-
bilizing effect on present college
organization.

The exact future of Grinnell
will be announced when the re—
sults of the War-Navy-Manpower
commission meeting in Washing-
ton Saturday are announced.
These results are aleady in the
hands of college officials but can-
not be made public until official—
ly released in Washington.

Publication of the Scarlet and
Black was delayed until today
because the hopes for such a re~

Chicago Area Sludenfs
To Dine and Dance A’r
Morrison Holel Dec. 29

Grinnell students in or near the
Chicagoland area have scheduled
a buffet supper and dance to be
held in the Roosevelt Room of
the Morrison hotel for pl'ospec»
tivc Grinnellians Tuesday. Dec.
29. William Strom, public relar
tions director, announced today.

Plans are being made in coir
nection with the public relations
department. by a committee of
twelltyrfive students headed by
Howard J. Lune. Gates, and Earn
bara Wagner, James, Strom said.
Mrs. Ruth Winter, Grinnell repre-
sentative for the Chicago area,
will invite prospective students.

Tickets for the buffet supper,
to be served at 7 p. ni., arc Sew
ellty»fivc cents, and may he, pur-
chased at the public relations ofr
fice, first floor, Y building, before
Christmas vacation, or from Mrs.
Winter, 315 IWeSL Lake strect,
Oak Park before Dec. 26. Resei»
vations will be made with a ticket
purchase.

All students in or near Chicago
are invited to attend, strum state
ed.

lease by last night were strong.
The release has not yet been
granted, but it is expected late
this week, according to Stevens.

“It is only logical that Grinnell
college with its unusuauy M34
qualo housing facilities should be
asked to extend them to the use
of such additional services as
have been described above” Ste—
vens said

“The size of the student body
for the second semester depends
entirely on whether the Men-
,power commission and the joint
duce active m tary service for
college men prior to the comple-'
tion of approved programs of
study," he added.

“I am not frec to make any
statement regarding the future of
reserves or of prospective draf-
tees, but all of the information
received thus far indicates that
there will be a greater causewa-
tion of manpower in schools than
we have previously Supposed."

"Nevertheless. the necessity or
further adjustment to the war ef-
fort may require that present
student housing facilities for both
men and women may have to be
altered."

“We shall make adjustments in
the curriculum and the building
arrangements if necessary, but
only to that point which will per-
mit us to maintain the standards
of liberal arts education on which
this college‘s existence has been
based,"

If such alterations have to be
made to accomodate a second
service school here, Stevens said
that adequate collegerowncd fa-
cilities can be provided for all
women students though men then
on campus will probably have to
find independent quarters in
town.

Reservists. according to the
president, will probably be real-
located in schools similar to the
ones Grinnell is considering The
exact location and typc of such,
schools was the matter under con-
sidcatioii in the Washington Con—
fci-ence.

Stevens pointed out, however,
that the total number of men in
all reserves and selective service
quotas to be sent back to colleges
at government expense has been
limited to 250.000. ’

In a normal year, between 84
and 900,000 men are enrolled in
American colleges. The number
of men being trained by the gov»
crnment—thc only able bodied
men over 18 expected to be in
culleges~will be only the numbci—
ordinanly in the freshman clas—
ses of the nation, according to
Stevens.
