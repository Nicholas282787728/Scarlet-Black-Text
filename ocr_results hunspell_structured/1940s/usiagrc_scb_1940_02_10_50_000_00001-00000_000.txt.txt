Majority of American College Students Dislike ‘Prepbcaiingf
Believe It or Not, Freshmen Arc Among Thosefor Hazing

 

AUSTIN, Texas, February 97A
majority of American college stir
dents themselves, even
of fraternities and sororities, dis
approve of the good old campus
tradition of hazing.

The most recent national poll of
the Student Opinion Surveys of
America indicates that only 32 per
cent of all students approve of the
pranks and punishments to which
initiates and freshmen have been
subjected for generations.

It is important to point out that
of the 68 per cent who declared
they were against hazing, 20 per
cent specified that they frowned
only on corporal punishment.

and electric shocks, however, are
not all right. Combining all types
of students, almost half of Lllemr

The canvass produced strong-
evidence that the “popular” lnlhar
tion customs that have long exist-
ed on most campuses are on a
decline, showing that there is
disapproval even among a maioi»
ity of members of Greek letter so-
cieties which sponsor the annual
“hell. week." Nonrfl‘atel'nity men
