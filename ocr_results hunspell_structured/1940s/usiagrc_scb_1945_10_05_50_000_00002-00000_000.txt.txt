Tomorrow Is Our World - -

It doesn’t seem to bother us much, here
at Grinnell we watch with cool de-
tachment the wild tax reduction race in
Congress, the nationwide labor upheaval.
That is for the nation‘s leaders to worry
about. We have enough trouble, with a
history test tomorrow and an English pa-
per due next month. Why read all that
stuff in the paper? It‘s just a mess any-
way.

But wait a minute . . . where will we
be in four years? Or, for some of us, in
one year? That's right, citizens, we'll be
out scraping up three meals a day and
maybe a little extra if we’re lucky. And
that‘s just where these issues that occupy
the headlines today are going to hit us.

Think about them for a minute. .The
house ways and means committee has just
voted for a $2,500,000,000 cut in individual
taxes. If it passes, that’s nice for Pop.
Maybe he’ll have a little more to put in
that allowance check for awhile . i but only
for awhile.

Because we’ll spend all of that check. . ,
and if it gets ally bigger we can find a
place for that, too. And back home, Pop
will be spending more than he used to, be—
cause it‘s a cinch he’s not going to send
us all he saves in reduced taxes. Pretty
soon, the manufacturers are going to no-
tice that there‘s even more money floating

around than there was during the wari
those old war days when the emergency
made yelling about price control llnpatriv
otic. So the manufacturer can yell now. , .
in fact, he's already started it: ‘fDown
with price control. Our labor struck, and
we have to pay higher wages. We have to
charge more."

In 1946 a lot of those boys in Congress
are up for reelection. The manufacturer
has a lot of votcs, in one way or another.
So does the taxpayer. So Mr. Candidate
votes [or relaiation of price control, and
for tax reduction, upon the recommenda-
tion of his also voteeconscious colleagues on
the ways and means committee. And trues
will be cut and the laborer will get higher
and higher wages, and the manufacturer
will raise prices. The dollar will buy less

. and less , . . and less.

In four years, or in one year, when the
Grinnellian goes after his tllree-squares—u-
day, that once attractive $45 to $50 a week
that a teacher or a junior executive or a
social worker may prayerflllly hope for is
going to look pretty puny. Teachers and
executives and social workers don’t strilie
for higher wages. It will have to do.

But don’t worry about it. After all,
there‘s always relief, If we can’t live on
what we can earn, the government will
take care of us. The taxes will go up again
to support us and deflation will set in, and
things will get back to former levels. A
bread line might be rather interesting. Be
sides, what can we do about it. Citizen,
think. What CAN we do? Tomorrow is
our world. '

On Our Honor - -

As they come to all college students,
hour examinations will soon come to Grin~
nellians. And with the advent of examin-
ations, a new responsibility will fall on
each and every student, The Honor System
is still, strictly‘ speaking, on probation. It
has become the personal duty of all of us
to make the system work. , ,

The, chief objection to the system ap—
pears to be this: no student wants to be
thought a tattle—tale. If this is the attitude
which is to prevail, there is no possible
chance for the system to work. We should
keep it in mind always that we must prose-
cute all offenders or we cannot be ’con-
sidered adult enough to keep this new free-
dom, To tell the honor court of a violation
of the code is not to be a tattle-tale. Out
in the great wide world it is not consid-
ered tattling to report a felony, and here
at Grinnell th'e same situation holds true.

To report a violation is to insure the safety
of our honor code. '

Naturally the Navy couldn’t let
the Army get one up on it, so

We really get a thrill out of
