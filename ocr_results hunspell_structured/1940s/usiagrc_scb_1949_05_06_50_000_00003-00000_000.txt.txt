, Glee Club Sings Before Packed House

me Performance

in Annual Formal Ho

By Ernest Lieber

Before a packed house the
Glee club did 'some splendid
singing. From the opening “Ag—
incourt Song," to the closing
group of college songs, every-
thing was done at a high level
of excellence.

The evening was a highly en—
joyable one, from all points of
view. What ultimately must
leave the iinal impression of a
group of singers is its abilities
to produce perfect tonal quali—
ties. And this Mr. Secular was
able to command from his group.
There were moments when the
tone was so nicely sounded that
it ioreed an immediate ,response
from the audience. Attention to
phrasing was paid with great
care.

The first soloist of the evening
was Robert Wells, who did a
really fine job of singing an an.
cient German love song. His dic—
tation was at all times clear, his
voice was full, and he gave
ample feeling to the song.

Ellen Altenbernd‘s solo, ace
companied by the new chapel
organ, brought the first part of
the program to a powerful cli-
max.

A group of folk songs was
followed by the high point of
the evening, Randall Thompson’s
"Tarantella." This is an Impre-
tentious piece that radiates hue
mor and joy, contrasted with
other selections that were more
sober. Here again~ the tone pros
duced by the group was even
and sustained. It is one of those
works that “fits the bill” in all
possible ways, and the Glee
club knew exactly how to
handle it, thereby creating an
exciting musical moment.

The evening's song fest was
brought to a close with three
Grinnell songs.
