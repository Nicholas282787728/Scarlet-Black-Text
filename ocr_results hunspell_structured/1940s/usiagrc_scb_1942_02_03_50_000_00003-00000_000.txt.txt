No Roof Garden?
Erikson Spikes

Dorm Rumor

There is no basis for the rumor
that the new Cowles dormitory
will be missing a roof garden,
Martin Erikson, building superin-
tendent, said today.

Erikson, when questioned in the
building this afternoon, said that
as far as he knew the roof garden
was still there, and would continue
to be there until the completion
of the new dorm. “It is up to the
students after that,” he said.

Erikson thought reason for the
rumor that has circulated might
be the fact that no work has been
done upon the roof garden recent-
ly.

“The cold weather has forced us
to work inside, and it would be too
expensive a risk to attempt com-
pletely to finish the roof garden
before spring,” he said.

Only the preliminary concrete
flooring has been poured at the
moment, but another smooth layer-
will be put on the roof garden.
When waxed, it will be perfectly
suitable for dancing, Er son
said.
