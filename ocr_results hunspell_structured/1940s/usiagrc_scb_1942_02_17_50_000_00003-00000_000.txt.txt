Van Paassen Talks

Continued from page 1

“There can never be another ne-

gotiated peace after this war. It
will breed another debacle like

this after these wounds are heal-
ed.”

“The American people are lax;
they do not linow there is a war
on. It is too far away. One bomb
dropped on their home town could
woke thelu up more than all the
newspaper Stories in the world.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

The French were one hundred per
cent more cautious about travel-
ing from one place to another,
allout sabotag'eiyet France fell.
Look at the Normandie.”

We bantercd about foreign situations,
but i thought I could hear about that at
the lecture that night and we branched
into phases of his life, my life, and Grim
nell College,

He seemed, interested in the cuts
legs. It (appeared he knew nothinr/
about its program, structure, Ill -
tori] or gene [Ll t-up. He was his
tei't ted to hear what I knew about
Ga midi—post, pres-r7713 and future.

It is difficult to keep a personal con-
versation running according to a set out-
line, Our talk was no different from the
ordinary in that l'cspe/etiaml in that rc-
spcct only, 1 might add, This summary,
therefore may seem jumpy, but that is
the way we talked, We spoke of one
thing and it would lead into many. An
hour and a. half is very little time when
you're in good company; Van Paassen is
the best.’

Underlying even a personal talk, Van
paasscn emphaSlzed that America must
take tlle leadership in the post-war world.

“The world must be ruled by econ
nomie concentration with Ameri-
ca as the concentrator. Britain
will not be in a position to dictate.

Her empire will never be the same.
She would be lost today if it was
not for the U. S. The Britishidea
of imperialism is a fundamental
basis for her defeats in the Far
East—which could have been
averted.” '

These are Van Paasell’s thoughts.
He said that American economic
power will ultimately see the United
Nations through to VlCtOl'yAbllC not
Without a bitter fight. There will be
social and economic changes beyond
our comprehension, but we can, if
we will, will.
