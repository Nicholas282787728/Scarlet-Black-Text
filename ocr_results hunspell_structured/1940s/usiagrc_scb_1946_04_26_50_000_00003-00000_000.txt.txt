Appraises Choir's
Easier Program
By Lois Carpenter

Grinnell college vesper choir
performed two cantatas over
Easter weekend in Herrick chapel.
‘Good Friday afternoon featured
Slainer's “Crucifixion," and at the
Easter Sunday vesper service with
the cooperation of the college

board of religion, the choir pre-
sented Bach's “Christ Lay in
Death's Dark Prison." ‘

In both cantatas the choir sang
extremely well under the able
direction of Director J. Forrest
West.

Soloists in the “Crucifixion"
were- Charles Wood, baritone.
junior; Earl Swearingen, bass,
Dibble sophomore; and Harold
Reeves, blind tenor from Cedar
Rapids. Considered especially
moving was the baritone recita-
tive, "Is in nothing to you all ye
that pass by." and the chorus
number following it. "The appeal
of the crucified." All the soloists
performed their numbers ably.

Bach’s cantata had as soloists
Ward Schwab, bass, Cowles fresh»
man. He sang with dignity and
special feelint’ for his solo, “The
