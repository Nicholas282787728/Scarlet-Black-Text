.America Wages War

Only the careless observer of the news can
fail to recognize this inescapable fact: that
economically, ideologically, and morally
America is at war with Nazi Germany and
her allies. Wholesale commitments by our
government of every kind of war material
have been made to Great Britain with the
fervent approval of the American people.
The sphere of direct military participation
alone have we failed to enter in this second
World War.

It is not our purpose here to comment on
the wisdom of America's foreign policy; it is
our purpose to follow out with logic and rear
son the possible consequences of such policy.

From the very outbreak of agitation in
the United States for supplying Britain
quickly and bountifully with materials of
war, the appeal has been made in the main
from motives of selfeinterest. Britain with
her navy was our first line of defense; a
conquered Br ain would place us in a most
vulnerable position from which to defend our
political economic, and social institutions.
The logic of these arguments is hard to re-
filte.

Last week, however, a different line of
reasoning was advanced by President Rooser
velt to justify our foreign policy. In his an-
nual message to Congress, he made two por-
tentous statements: (1) that we, as a na-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

tion, must strive for the establishment of
freedom of speech, freedom of worship, free-
dom from want and freedom from fear the
world over; (2) that we as a nation can
never “acquiesce in a peace dictated by
aggressors and sponsored by appeasers.”

In other words, our policy can be charac-
terized in one of two ways: either, (1) we
are “all-aidetoBritaining" from enlightened
self-interest and an earnest desire to keep
England strong and free: or (2) we are “all—
aid-to—Britaining” because we have again
fallen into the role of the militant defender
of democracy and freedom for all the world.

If the latter statement is true, we might
as well face the chilling conclusion that
American soldiers will die once more in
Europe.

interviews than using the job survey for
that purpose If we can bring responsible
executives to this campus, they will have an
opportunity to talk to seniors on the stu-
dents’ own home grounds. Much of the
stress and strain of a formal interview in
an executive’s busy office will be eliminated.
The first quic 'mpressions made under. disV
tracting conditions, which so frequently
work to the disadvantage of the inexperi—
enced senior, will be eliminated. The real
worth of many men who do not easily make
strong first impressions will have larger
changes of becoming apparent to the dis»
criminating placement officer. _

In addition to these advantages the seml-
nar will make it possible for students to llnr
derstand more clearly than would otherwise
be the case the line of promotion and the
order of advancement which is character-
istic of large business and industrial organie
zations in which they hope to make their
economic future.

As a result students will go into jobs with
more discrimination as to what they must
do to make progress. They will eliminate
from consideration jobs which definitely are
of a blind alley character.

It is possible that in addition to the plan—
ned seminars and interviews on the campus,
we may arrange for seniors in small groups
to spend week ends as guests of a number of
large organizations and have the additional
advantage of seeing the total work situation
in which they may find occupational oppon
tunities.

Far from taking away from the senior
any placement advantage which the job sur-
vey theoretically affords, the proposed plan
of coordination will give to every senior a
significantly greater opportunity to select

his job wisely.

President.
