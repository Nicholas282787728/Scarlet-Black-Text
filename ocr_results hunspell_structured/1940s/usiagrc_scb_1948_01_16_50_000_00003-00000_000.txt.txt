Drop Road Games

By George \Vollsclilileger

Local hopes took a tumble as
Gl'mnell’s varsity cagers extended
their losing streak or road games
with defeats at the hands of
Lawrence and Ripon last Friday
and Saturday.

Handicapped over the weekend
by injuries to Peisncr, Potter and
Booth, the Pioneers laced Law-
rcnce Friday night at Appleton
and came out on the short end
of 67-55 score. The next night
Ripon’s lanky forwards helped in
a 69-53 trouncing of the visiting
Pioneers.

The Lawrence fracas opened
rather raggedly but picked up
gradually, At half-time the Vik—
ings werc clinging to a 34-32 edge
but warmed considerably in the
second half; and their ability to
hit from almost all angles, com-
bined with the injuries on Dobbs'
squad turned the game into a
near rout.

An acccntuatcd height handi-
cap confronted the Pioneers upon
their arrival at Ripon the next
night. The Redmen's Weiske
(6’5") and Shepherd (6’6") top-
ped the best Grinnell had to offer
in height, Ray Kallwasser (6’4”J.

The‘ Pioneers fell behind from
the first of the game but staged
a last half spurt that narrowed
the margin. i

Three fouls chalked up against
the Pioneers in rapid succession
and successfully cashed in by
Ripon enabled the Redmen to pull
steadily away.
Gregg, smith sophomore, are vy-
ing for first string berths. Har-
old “Bud" Gregg, Smidifreshman,
Chicago high school Standout,hss
the heavyweight class practically
to himself. At the other end of
the scale, Dave Segur, Gates
sophomore, will be the sole Grin-
nell entrant in the 121-pound
class.
