GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

The staff is consideling n new delivery

system that they would be glad to put into

effect IF the majoriy of the students are
in favor of it. They would be pleased to do
this because it would save them a lot of
time and money. The plan is simply this:
the paper would be placed in Main hall to
be picked up by the students after they
come from the dinner meal on th days of
publication. This is “applepie” for the cir»
culation department, but the staff does not
believe it will insure every student’s re-
ceiving a copy of the paper. The regular
delivery to merchants and town subscrib-
ers would continue, naturally, but student
delivery would be simplified.

We think you are getting the best deal
now, but if you do not think so, again we

Are You Or Do You Wani-

Are you satisfied with the distribution
method of the SCARLET AND BLACK, or
do you want a change? Before you make a
hasty decision, listen to our side of the
story. After ,you have decided, the staff
would sincerely appreciate CONSTRUG
TIVE criticism through the medium of let-
ters to the editor. The famous restaurant
slogan, “If you‘re satisfied, tell others; if
not, tell us,” applies to this situation.

Did you know that in most other col-
leges the student newspaper is placed in a
central part of the campus and the students
help themselves—01‘ go news-hungry. Be-
sides this helter-skelter distribution system
the subscription rates are decidedly higher
than you pay. You pay only sixty-two cents
21 YEAR for the SCARLET AND BLACK
~and it‘s delivered to your house.

r iterate write us a letter. Are you satis-
fied, or would you like a change? What do
you say?

Some’rhing New

‘Many new stars are being added to the
Grinnell college service flag this week.
When the work is completed there will be
almost 300 blue stars and three gold ones—
signii‘ying three Grinnell men who have
given their lives in this war. For Grinnell
women who are constantly asking, “What
can I do for the war effort?" here is a
positive answer. Sew. What better cause is
there than visibly showing by a short sew-
ing session that there are many Grim-tell
menapast and presenwwho are devoting
ALL of their time to the war effort? Wom-
en, you must remember that every man on
this campus (no matter what you think of
his Don Juanish qualities) is here on strict-
ly borrowed time. Every man here is a po-
tential blue or gold star for the flag. If we
ever get to thinking that we of the middle
west are far-removd from the war. or think
that we are insignificant and inefficient in
helping the war—effort, just look at the
Grinnell service flag. It speaks for itself.

Classroom

In The Pink

For Lovell

Fatherhood pays. So says George
D. Lovell, instructor in psychol-
ogy, who was the guest of honor
yesterday (his newlybom daugh-
ter being unable to attend) at a
nursery shower given by one of
his classes. The next party was
held in “Goodnow Nursery’ (or
“Lovell Hovel”l~formerly the
phsychology laboratory, during
What is ordinarily the 2:30 class
period.

The affalr was the brainstorm
of Faith Weis and Joan Mus
Grape, noted physchology stu-
dents, and was carried by mem<
bers of Mr. Lovell's 2:30 class,
remnants of an earher class
who stayed to watch the fun,
and cooperative faculty members
who detained Lovell while the
room was being decorated.

The classroom was decorated
with pink and blue crepe paper,
and Lovslrs desk was given an
additional fringeof pink and blue.
0n the door was is sign. “Good-
now Nursery or Lovell Hovc
beneath which a pink bow wss
prominently displayed.

No shower is complete without
gifts. The class presented Lovell
with a. rattle, a diaper. n nib, and
a dollsdn intended for use by
little Judy (who was almost one
day old at the time.)

Blushing, Lovell examined the
rattle and stsmmcrcd, "Is this
for rural" He didn't question the
other gim.

So the nursery party was rc-
ported to have been a success.
Miss Wcis and Miss McGrane
were happy. The classWas happy.
Lovell was thrilled.

Letters to the
Editor

To the Editor

This letter is written by one, but
speaks for many. I want in con»
gractuate your editorial staff on
their editorial in the October so
issue, entitled, “Why Break Our
Necks.”

Tbs cinder path problem has
been acute ever since We got here.
The heavy rains of the lat have:
made it worse. Students complain
about the path running along the
highway every time they use it.
In fact, they do not use it, but
walk in the grass beside it. If
only in the patriotic sense of con<
serving valuable shoe leather and
rubber heels reconstruction is
necessaryiand soon.

Thanks again for bringing this
subject to light.

John Barnes, ’44.

“I wish I could pass out cir
gcrs,” he remarked. "Maybe I
will tomorrow."
