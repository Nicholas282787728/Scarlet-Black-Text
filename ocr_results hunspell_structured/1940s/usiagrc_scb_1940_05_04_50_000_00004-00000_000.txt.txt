When you buy a pack of cigarettes, give
it the smoker’s perfect quiz . . . Is it mild?
Is it cool? Does it taste better? If you do
that, you’ll turn by choice to Chesterﬁeld

Their blend of the best tobaccos grown,
their size, shape and the way they burn,
all help to make Chesterﬁeld America’s
Busiest Cigarette.
