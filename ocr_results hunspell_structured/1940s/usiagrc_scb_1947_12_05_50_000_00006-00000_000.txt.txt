ond squad. and two backs re
ccived honorable mention as thel
Mid-West conference wound upl
the '47 season with the release
of all-star selections and confer—
ence final standings.

Herb White, end, and stew
Richmond, center, were voted
berths on the conference's second
squad in balloting by the confer-i
ence coaches Herb had earlier
been voted to a first string spot
on Carleton's all-opponent selec-
tions, and brother Mel was elected
to a second string berth.

Bachfield men, Fred Webb and
Walt Burns, were awarded hone
orablc mention in the poll. Plane
eer quarterback Kermit Stein-
beck, who last year was allrcon-
ference first string choice, was
inJured during the Homecoming
game, which probably spiked his
chances for a repeat performance
this year.

Scholarship Board
Awards Loans, Jobs

“The number of applications for
financial assistance did not indi-
cate that the recent increase of
overall cost at Grinnell had
caused a very great hardship to
many students," Karl E. Dear-
horn, dean of personnel adminis-
tration, said in a prepared release
last Tuesday.

The Scholarship committee, at
its regular meeting last week,
considered all applications for fi-

ncty of individual awards based
upon need, including scholarships,
work assignments. and student
loans. For needy students pre~
viously holding any of the above,
the amount was increased.

The opportunity for others to
request special consideration is
still open.
