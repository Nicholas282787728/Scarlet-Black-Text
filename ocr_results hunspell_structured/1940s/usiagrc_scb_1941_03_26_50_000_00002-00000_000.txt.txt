. The Old Order Changeth.

No matter how eager we may be to encom-
pass the spirit of the new Grinnell, we can-
not help but hold deep admiration for those
who have worked to establish the founda»
tions for this college, who have had the
vision and the zeal to encourage tlle tradi—
tions which have made Grinnell college

strong. Grillnell owes a large debt to such
men and women as Edward Steiner, Garrett
VVycl<oif, Mrs. Laetitia Moon Conard, Harry
Waldo Norl's, Donald Grass, and Edward
Spencer, for what she has been. She owes
a still larger debt to them for what she is,
and most of all, for what she is to become.

“The old order changeth, yielding place to
new.” These familiar lines of Tennyson are
most appropriate for Grinnell students this
year. The future is built upon the greatness
of the past, and the future of Grinnell must
be based upon the accomplishments of such
leaders as these, scholars who are I'ECOgL
nized in their fields throughout the country,
professors who have inspired hundreds of
students at Grinnell.

Graduating classes in the future will miss
Mr, Spencer‘s presence as chaplain at the
Commencement exercises. Students will
miss the dry humor of Mr. Norris; they will
miss Mrs. Conal'd’s striving for social pro-
gress, and the scholarly work of Mr. Wyc-
lioff as head of the sociology department;
they will miss the friendliness of Ml Grass,
the last head of the business administration
department in Grinnell; and certainly they
will miss Dr. Steiner’s beautiful and emo-
tionally stirring talks to the/students at
Christmas time. We students shall miss all
these things, and much more. We shall miss
the spirit and tradition of Griniiell which
these men and women do and always shall
symbolize.

We feel much like the little boy in James
Hilton‘s novel, “Goodby, Mr, Chips", who, in
leaving his old professor for the last time,
turned and said, “Goodby, Mr. Chips, Goods
by,—a.nd goodby." In that simple farewell
is expressed the feelings that every Grinnell
student must have at this time.

ment of minds and Jim's .of
young men and women.

Here at Grinnell. We boast of
our experience of this reality.
Grinnell is great because it has
had great men, high spirited and
wise, disciplined and humble, who
found ihcir deepest satisfaction:
in a scholarly Way of life. They
had an experience of personal
growth as they saw the intellecr
tual horizons of young men and
women expand under me stimular
Lion of their good teaching.

In this special issue i)! the
Scarlet and Black we pay tribute
to some at tlicso great men who,
liming given their lives to the
College, are now retir‘ng from
accivc service. No tradition of the
College should be more carefully
treasured than the one represent.
ed by these great scholars and
teachers. Nothing will guarantee
the continuing greatness of the
College quite so much as to have
younger mcmbcis of the faculty
accept the challenge or perform-
ers laid down by them.

It is fitting, therefore, 'tbat We
should thus publicly pay tribute
to men who have given the Col-
lege its greatness, and in particu-
lair, pay homage to these great
spirits who are ret ing from ac-
tive participation in the routine
institutional lie of the College.
Grinnell will be poorer because
those men no longer teach in
classrooms and wisely direct the
educational policies of the institu-
lion.

To Professor Hail-y Waldo
Norris, Sc. D., whose ﬁfty years
of continuous service at Grim-lei!
is s icconl to be cuvicd and
whose distinguished contributions
to biological science have brought
him national recognition, we
acknowledge oni- debt institu-
tionally and individually.

To Professor Edward Alfred

Steiner, Ph. D., We pay mbuie
with deep affection. \For thirty-
eight years he has demonstrated
that “the meek shsll inherit the
earth." A lovel‘ of mankind, he
has succeeded in mskihg mankind
more lovable. As a Christian
gentleman his attitudes and ideals
have continually revealed the
fact that he is of one mind with
the Maslcr of men.

To Professor Edward B. '1‘.
Spencer, A. in, .we y've that lov-
iug affection which is the “musk—
ed for reward of men who live
wisely and beautifully, and walk
humbly before their God. For
thirty yum-s he has been u teach-
er par excellence, who has made
the ancient glories of Greece and
Rome 2. living reality to hun-
dreds of students,

To Professor Garrett P. Wy-
okoff, LL. D., We are proud to
give recognition as a scholar and
social administrator, Thousands of
men and women in the deep
south, who never heard his name
and to whom he is unknown,
are benefactors of his wisdom
because of the guidance which he
gave to the development of a.
sound program of social relief
throughout the territory.

To Professor Douala Frederick
Grass, Pb. D., we give recognition
roi- having revealed the place of
culturc in busincss and the ml-
minisu-nl-lon of business affairs as
a. cultural ohm-pm c, worthy of
the best thought of men who
would make business it way of
life.
In Professor Laetitia Moon Cou-
ard, Ph. D., we recognize a
brilliant and wise woman, who
has made the subject matter of
sociology of vital significance.
Quiet and unassuming to a fault,
she has seriously undertaken the
task of making the Christian
philosophy of life the fundamental
basis for theories of social recon-
strllction and programs of comc
munity organization.
