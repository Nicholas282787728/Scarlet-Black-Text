OPEN FORUM

 

EDITOR'S NOTE:

The following letter was received
by the editor ot the Scarlet and
Black on last Saturday morning,
following what Mr. Matlack terms
the "l‘apaclous" open forum of
the April 19 issue. It is being
printed, even at this late date.
for several reasons:

1, We think Mr. Matlack wrote
it to be printed. consistently,
he mentions the “The Chale
lenge” of last week was
hardly the legitimate prop
erty ot the Scarlet and
Block since it is addressed
to the pre 'dent of the Stu-
dent Council, not the editor
of the paper Inasmuch as
Mr. Matlack caretnlly ad-
dressed his letter to the
proper person, and delive
ered it himselt, we assume
he will not object to its use.

2. It is such a joy to us, in
our cold, lonely, and mISn
understood editorial life. to
find that the solicitations of
the Deity are invoked upon
our endeavors by our read-
ers.

3. Mr. Matiack is such a clever
boy.

Editor in Chief

The Grinnell Scarlet and Black
Grillnell College

Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Miss Funk:

The most amazing pair of docu-
ments have just appeared in the
Grinnell Scarlet and Black: Earth
shaking documents: And of great
length, also. I did not pause
in my excited and incredulous
perusal of those momentous
epistles to count the columns
and lines devoted to them but
, it would seem that a staggering
amount of vital newsprint has
been sacrificed toward this great
and noble cause. It must be
admitted that whcn our “Open
Forum" does make an appear

once, it does so With a tei i-
fying iapscity for space.

.Now the first of these two
letters is entitled THE CHAL-
LENGE. it is addressed to the
president of the student Council.
Marilyn McCool, and is signed
by several men students. It is
a comparatively short and mod»
erate statementijust about one-
third the length of the master-
Lil document which follows. It
accomplishes its avowed purpose,
that is, it shows an interest in
student govei-nniont‘whether a
right or wrong interest indeed,
it is not for such as me to Judge
73nd it is addressed to the
proper person. There is really
nothing unusual about this letter
at all. The lads have a gripe to
express, and they express it in
the most proper way I know.

But now we come to the sec-
ond of these two \lrorldrswuying
letters. This one is THE RE-
PLY. Here if anywhere in all
the s it 13': 1 have read in my
four years at Grinncll, we have
the righteous and indignant 0|an
pouring of a. tortured and ag-
grieved soiil. This one should
warm the cockles of all our little
hearts, tor here that noble char
acter, that martyr of the cam-
pus makes his searing answer
to those little boys who pester
nun. How crimson their faces
must be! Say novlihe really
tells 'em off. And moreover
there’s plenty he doesn't .tellv
for Howard J. Liu-ie knows all
the dirt, and if those small boys
don't lay otf him, he's going to
spill the unholy beans, see? and
they're in the dirt deeper than
he is, see? and they’ll sure be
sorry they started this mess.
Mr, Lurie is a vcry busy person
ahe has lots of other worries——
so don't antagonize him or he’ll
bite you, by God!

furor. Why in the name of all
that‘s decent are these two
precious documents revealed 'to
such as me or you? Why this
extravagant outlay of print and
paper [or all this? The first let—

How did the s & B obtain it?

Did Miss McCool it to

Did the S & B swipe it? For
all I know they might have in»

Perhaps the signers asked that
it be published. That‘s quite pos—
sible, although why they should
escapes me. But the simple lead~
er is given no hint as to why
the letter is published, no es-
planation given, It would seem
that the only justification for

basis for Mr. ,Lurie's voluminous
reply, But Mr. mm is a busy,

that he must needs stoop, sully
his hands with such trivia.

I must admit that there was

thoughtful reflection, 1 keep hear-

are we treated to this exhibition

Surely this is not the function
