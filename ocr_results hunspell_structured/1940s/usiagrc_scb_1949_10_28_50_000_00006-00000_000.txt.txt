For Kohawks; 33-6 Massacre

Grinnell wrapped up its third straight win of the season by
unleashing a ground attack that humbled Coe_33—ti at Cedar Rapids

last Saturday afternoon.

Coe's homecoming celebration was started along the road to ruin

when the Pioneers blocked a
punt on the Coe 14, Two line
plays produced little and then
Rudy Miler raced through a
big hole in the left side of the
Coe line to score standing up.l
The try for the extra point was:
not good.

As the second period opeiid the
Pioneers launched their third
pay dii-t drive of the half, a
march of '13 yards. Skip Klngery,
Steve Hitchcock, and Miller car.

from where Miller slammed ov-
er on a line buck. The third
score crossed before the quarter
was four minutes old.

Deep in the third period of
the ball game Hank Brown‘s
club ripped off 75 yards in only
l‘hreee plays to tally again. Kings
ery picked up a few yards, then
Don Slocum made it a first
down on the Coe 47. The last leg
of this drive was a 53 yard gale
lop by Hitchcock who drove off
his own right tackle and sprinted
down the sidelines all the way
to the double chalk marks. Bare
me Oakes made the conversion
and Grinnell led 26-0.

Coe, now using a single wing,
managed to shake Fred Schwind
loose for 27 yards and a touch.
down with five minutes gone in[
the final period. Schwind went
around his own right end and
then cut back to midfield to
register standing up. ,

Grinnell matched this effort
a few minutes later when Jack

on a quick opener and travelled
65 yards for a score. Oakes’ con-

The Scoreboard l

The old scoreboard shows that
the Lawrence Vikings all but
sewed up the 1949 Midwest con-
ference football crown when
they rambled past the defending
champion, Ripon, 2377 last Sat-
urday . . . This victory instii-es'
the Wisconsin train of at least
a tie for the title . . . But as
Beloit is the last league toe of
the Vikings, Lawrence should

 

have very little trouble in
sweeping to a clear conference
crown tomorrow afternoon . . .

While Grinnell was defeating
Coe college a week ago, Knox
picked up its first league win
at the expense of Beloit 20-12

. . , Carleton dropped its third
consecutive game, this time to
Carroll to . . . Monmouthl
crushed Cornell 4070 . . .

In six contests this season the
Pioneers have racked up 113
points, more than they have
scored in any one year since
the war . . . 1946 was worth 82
points, 1947 saw 59, and 1948
a lowly 27 points , . .
