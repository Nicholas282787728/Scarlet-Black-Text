Sluden’r Heal’rh Bes+ in Three Years

Miss Swan Credils
'Heallh Consciousness’
For Improved Record

Grinnell students have been
healthier each year for the past
three years, according to a report
by college nurse Florence M, Swan
released by Dean Beatty yester-
day.

The improvement is especially
noticeable in the number of flu
cases reported, Beatty said, al-
though the improvement is notice-
able in the general health situation
as well.

According to Miss Swan's re-
port, women's iuiirmary oflice
calls dropped almost 50%,, from
January 1941 with 1083 lo the
same month in 1943 with 533. At
the same time hospital patient
days for the women dropped from
193 to 69 almost one—third.

Figures for the men are incom—
plete for the 1940-41 period, but
a comparison with last year‘s fi-
gures shows a drop in the number
of hospital days for the two month
period, from so last year to 36
during the past two months.

No reasons for the improvement
have been given, although Miss
Swan, in her report, suggests that
required physical conditioning and
the many Army and Navy physical
examinations may be contributing
factors.

Another important factor which
partially invalidates the apparent
drop in illness is the drop in en-
rollment. However, in the case of
the women, at least. which is the
group most thoroughly and accu-
rately covered in the report, the
drop in illness reported is much
greater than drop in enrollment.

Which indicates. say college au—
thorities, that the campus‘well
the women, at leastiare definitely
more health conscious.
