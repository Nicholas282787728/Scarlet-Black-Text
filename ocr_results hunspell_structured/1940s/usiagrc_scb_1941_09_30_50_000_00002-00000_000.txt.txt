0 Religion at Grinnell.

(Mum-u 7lvlc: The following/ Editorial written
by 1).. Everlon, (10ml of the cllfzpcl, ii n11 mp1"-
ioiuoo of Ho o rial i-clioioiii program o/ Groi—
ion.)

Religion is a part of our cultural heritage
in which a generl education should, fur»
nish some orientation. Literacy ill the'field
of religion is just as central in a general
education as, for example, literacy in the
field of the natural sciences. Therefore,
this year, Grinnell is providing a revised
program of religious activity designed to
meet the needs and challenge the interests
of all the students. A Board of Religion
has been formed which has complete re-
sponsibility for the planning of all reli-

gious programs on the campus. It is a
representative hoard composed of nine stu-
dents, under the leadership of Don Jacobs.
There are three faculty advisors.

It has been recognized for some time
that the daily chapel services and tradi—
tional Vesper hours of the past have not
been effective from the point of view of
student participation Hence a new ex-
periment is being tried this year. In place
of the daily chapel there will be only two
chapel periods during the week, with meet-
ings on Tuesdays and Fridays. One of these
will he of a distinctly religious nature, and
the other period will be devoted to con-
vocations, studcllt assemblies, and forums
on subjects of particular interest to stue
dents.

The major change in program is the
shift from the Vesper hour to the College
church, meeting at eleven»thirty on Sun-
day mornings. Occasionally there will be a
Vesper service and the traditional form of
service will be used. Student participation,
not only in the choir and as ushers but
ill leadership of the worship will feature
the College church services. It is the my
-tention of the Board of Religion that at
all times the interpretation of religion will
be realistic, and relevant to the special and
individual interests of the students.

It is not the intention of the College
church to compete with the local churches
Students new affiliated with towli church—
es will be encouraged to continue that
affiliation The same holds trbe of those
faculty members new active in local church-
es. However, all students and faculty mem-
members of whatever creed or faith will
be welcome at the College Clllli'cll. It is the
express hope of the Board of Religion to
make the total expression of religion in
the community more effective.

Criticisms and suggestions \lllicll you
may have to offer which will help to guide
the board in developing this new program
will be welcome. Its success will depend
very largely on your interest and your
participation.

The appearance of a Town men’s intramural team seems to us would
create more spirit among both the Town men and the dormitory teams.
It would have a unifying effect on the Town men, and would bring them

together more frequqently.
