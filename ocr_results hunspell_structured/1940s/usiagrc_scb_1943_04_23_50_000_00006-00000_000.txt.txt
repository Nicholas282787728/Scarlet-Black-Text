Dibble hall handed ClarkrRead
their first defeat yesterday in an
extra-inning contest. the best
played game of the current sea-
son. Swinging into an early lead.
ClarleRcad seemed headed for
victory, when the Dibble boys
finally began connecting with
Bob Muysken's offerings. Tying
the game up at six all in the
fifth inning, the game turned
into a stalemate for two innings.
Several potential Dibble scorers
got on base, only to have their
side retired hy the smoothly-work-
ing ClarleRead infield. Dibble
finally turned the trick in the
eighth inning, sending a run
across the plate for the iviniiing
score.
