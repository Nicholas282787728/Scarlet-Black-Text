Grinnell may show a lot of spirit at its
basketball games, but much of it is not of
the sporting variety. It seems deplorable
that a student body, so often lacking in a
united enthusiasm, should pervert what
spirit may crop up by being poor sports.

When Detroit university played here, the
chances are that olle of the best basketball
players who ever set foot on our floor was
with them, Callahan was an All-American,
and he showed us why. But instead of
applauding his skill, we'ragged and tor-
mented him. True, it was in the hopes of
helping us win, but it was poor sportsman-
ship.

Such a performance by the spectators was
reason enough to arouse this remark: “In
the East, a school which received its guest
players with such an attitude would be drops
ped from the other school’s schedules.” But
perhaps we belong to the wild and wooly
West, where courtesy is unknown.

When a referee makes a mistake, we ex-
press our dissatisfaction in a nauseating
tone of disgust. Worse still, we don’t con—
fine our offenses to poor decisions, but boo

just as lllstily when the referee calls a well-
deserved foul on one of our own pet players.
We wollder at the fairness of the referees
to Grinnell when the Grinnell spectators
seem to offer nothing but vituperntion in
retum.

We can commend a student body that
applauds the opposing team for good work;
we like to see lusty cheering in support of
our team; but we’d rather see apathy than
poor sportsmanship.

“If I hadn’t fallen down on the final I would
have gotten a good grade in the course.”

“I can’t see why I ﬂuuked the final test.
I studied a whole day for it.”

There probably isn’t a student in Grinnell
who hasn’t had thoughts similar to those
quoted above. Yet most of the students go

every semester, and do little investigation to
try to find out the reason for their difficul—
ties.

Practically every student in Grinnell is
more or less lazy and is interested in getting
the requirements of his studies ill as little
time as possible. This attitude is helpful if
properly used, but the trouble is that most
students are not intelligently lazy. Many be-
lieve that the way to get a glade in the
shortest time is by cramming. They find,
however, that though this method is some-
times satisfactory for small tests, it falls
down when they get to the filial exam.

A student could save himself a lot of work
if he used a little applied psychology. One
principle that would help is the rule uhich
says that it is much more difficult per unit
to memorize a lot of facts at the same time
than it is to learn a small group of facts.
In other words it will take much less time
in the long run if the intelligently lazy stu-
dent will get his daily assignments rather
than wait and try to learn everything at
once. Psychological tests show that much
of the forgetting of memorized material
occurs during the first hour. This means
that time will be saved in the long run if the
student will review the material immediately
after reading it. The rule points to the fact
that reviewing once a week will save a lot of
grief at the end of the year. Psychology
also shows that recitation, either to yourself
or to others, is by far the easiest way to
memorize.

The above are just a few principles which,
if applied, will save the student time. If we
are going to be lazy about this studying
business, at least let’s be intelligently lazy
and use the methods that will yield the
greatest knowledge in the least time.

And don’t forget that uhile spring may
be fine for some “activities,” studying for
finals isn’t olle of them.

ed is the situation now existing in
the Grinnell college appointment
bureau, according to Phyllis M.
Tod, secretary.

The bureau, which was reorg-
anized in the fall of 1938 by Miss
Tod, serves as a clearing house
between employers and Grinnell
seniors and Grinnell graduates.
Both seniors and graduates are
entitled to its services on pay-
ment of one dollar.

Every fall letters are written to
approximately 450 firms advising
them of the services of the office.
In the meantime, five individual
booklets are made out for each
senior containing a photograph of
the prospective job applicant, vit~
al information about him, and
written recommendations by those
who have had contact with him,

When an employer advises the
bureau of an opening in his firm,
booklets of those best fitted for
the job are immediately sent to
him. The employer then decides
from the booklets which candi-
dates he wishes to interview in
person.

The underlying aim of the ELI):

 

pointment bureau is to advise
graduates of openings in firms
throughout the country, so they
may better their positions, Miss
Tod stated.

The office placed 97.7% of last
year’s graduating class, besides
finding better jobs for many grad-
uates of previous years. “1 try
to get the right person for the
right Job," she said.

Prentiss Hall Inc,, of New York,
school book publishers, have writ—
ten to the appointment bureau to
say that they have interviewed 300
handpicked college graduates to
hire since March, 1939. From this
group, three were given jobs, and
two of the three were Grinnell
graduates.

Pact Abrogatl'on
Wisdom Doubled

By Willmm‘ G. Harris.

Buried under a pile of Russian
stiffs in last week's news was the
first official result of last sum»
mer's about—face in American
Faneastern policy.

Marking the ¢nd of an brie
ycar old policy of brotherly love
lor the Japanese, the 1911 U.
s.—Japaiiese trade pact expired
on January 25. And now, filcli-
ing the big stick of Roosevelt
1, Roosevelt 11 and his prime
minister, Cordell Hull, are pro.
paring to apply said instru-
ment to the rear of Nipponesc
pants,

Heretoforc enjoying generous
benefits in the American duty
structure, Japanese products are
now placed on the ordinary tar-
iff basis without benefit of most-
favoredmation considerations.

That the abrogation of the
treaty gave ample reason for

the recent, illrconcenled Nippo-
neso dither can be briefly indi-
cated (1) in the first ten
months of 1939, the United
states took 33 per cent of Jar

pun’s exports; (2) the U. s.
supplied 44 per cent of Japan’s
imports during the some period;
and (s) Nipponesc exports of
raw silk to America, hereto—
fore entering duty free. last
year nctleu Japan $84,000,000
in muchrneeded foreign ex-
cluingc,

For several years Japan has
been preparing for a possible
birch»swinging by Uncle Sam:
scrap iron imports jumped 30 per
cent in 1939, and more than a
year’s supply of crude oil has
been accumulated. Moreover,
Great Britain has not abrogated
her trade treaty with the Japa-
nese, and rumor has it that an
rangements have been made to
obtain oil from the Dutch East
Indies and Mexico. And there re-
mains a distinct possibility of l a
RussoeJapanese tleVup.

However, the European “or
has added strength to the
American arm by the curtaib
merit of those sources of sup-
ply for the Japanese, as has a
grouing wanweuriuias in Nip-
pon and the importance of U. s.
markets to the Japanese for
elgu exchange holdings.

Fundamentally, this change-co

heart in American-Japanese relz»
tlons involves more than the land
of the rising sun. It becomes a
question of our future status in
the Far East and particularly of
om- position in the Philippines.

That driving Japan into the
arms of Russia and Germany is
the smart thing to do is open
to question. And it is a highly
debatable proposition that our
interests in the Far East justi-
fy our antagonizing Japan,
thereby raising the possible
necessity for our retention and
fortification of the Philippines
to’ protect those interests from a
hostile Japan,

If the antagonizing goes no
further than commercial retalia-
tions, a firmer policy toward the
Japanese may be advisable. But
playing policeman in the Pacific
for standard Oil and British
pounds can become expensive in
men and money without the exer-
