The prerChristmas season at
Grinnell has not always been the
event-packed, hcitcr shelter whirl
which we are now experiencing.
Its festivities and traditions have
accumulated over the decades.

In the early years of Gri
nell’s history, the Christmas spi -
it was conspicuous only by its
absence. Since it was considered
too early to bcgin festivities be—
fore vacation, activities were com
fined to the annual presentation
oi the “Messiah.”

In the year 1915, the Christ-
mas spirit hit the Crinncll came
pus with a rush. At that time,
two traditions, now an integral
part of thc Grinnell routine, were
instituted 7 the Yule Log din»
ner for women. and thc all-cola
lcgc Christmas party.
