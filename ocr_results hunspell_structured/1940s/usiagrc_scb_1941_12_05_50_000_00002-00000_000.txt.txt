O The Cyclone

During the spring of every year, there is
one thing which students look forward to
almost as much as the end of the school
year.
That spring feature is the Cyclone hunt,
When that bell rings out in the night a
Roman holiday is in the offering, and every-

one has a good time.

And remember that without the Cyclone,
there can be no Cyclone hunt.

This year the cost of printing the book
amounts to almost six dollars.

And the price to you, the students, is
only four dollars.

And what do you get for this cash out—
lay?

You get over two thousand pictures with
every group and class of the campus in-
cluded.

You get oopy which will still be alive to
you in fifty years, if you live that long.

And you get the pleasure of seeing a
book which belongs to you, as students, as
long as a copy of it exists.

It is your book, and it demands your sup-
port.

O Adios, Senor O’Gorman

Tonight Dr. O’Gorman concludes a two-
week stay on the Grinnell campus. Where-
ever his line of duty carries him next, we
should like to wish him the best of luck and
happiness.

It was not merely that the presented a
new and stimulating approach to the prob—
lems confronting the nations of the western
hemisphere. Nor was it merely his im-
maculate appearance and personable nature.

We liked Dr. O‘Gol‘lnan principally be-
cause of his genuine interest in us as col<
lege students. We learned to respect his
opinions more as we got to know him bet-
ter. And he was anxious that we should
know him better.

With a well-Wishing duff of the sombrero,
We bid our Mexican friend “adios.”

The offer csmc as a complete
surprise to chaffce, but he said
he thought it the easiest way to
settle things. Chaffee decided this
even after Charles P. Vogel,
county attorney, advised him last
week that it was practically im-
possible for spcncer to sue suc-
cessfully.

The pneps have heen in danger
of losing their bank roll since
last September when they took
the lumber for a pep rally.

Chaffee, in commenting on the
trouble, declared. “I'm glad it's

over, but I didn’t like the tax."
