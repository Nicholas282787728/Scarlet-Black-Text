Eulogy - -

Tonight, as this is being written, the nation
is receiving with deepest sorrow the worst
news of the war—that of the death of the
Commander-ill-Chief.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt headed the
nation during the most troublous times ill
its history. When he same to office in
1933 the United States was on the verge
of financial collapse, and not far from rev-
olution.

His part in recovery we will not debate
here, but that the nation applauded his
actions was proved by his land-slide re-
election in 1936 and his precedent smash,
ing third term for which he was elected
in 1940.

Foreseeing to some extent December 7,
1941, he was advocating armament and
compulsory training back in the days
when the nation’s businessmen were blithely
shipping scrap iron to Japan’s munitions
plants. When December 7 came, we were
not prepared . . . but that we at least had a
start toward preparedness was due to the
President’s vigorous support of such a pro-
gram. And during the dark days after we
first entered the war, the Senate must at
times have wished that it had been more
receptive to administration approved plans
for fortifying the Pacific outposts.

Last November the citizens cast their
vote of confidence in the way the Com-

malldcr—in-Chief was carrying on the war
when they elected him for the fourth time.

Today the President is dead.

Witll our troops near Leipzig and Ham-
burg and Berlin, with establishment of
large areas of allied control on Okinawan!
the military outlook is brighter than it has
ever been, but our grief today is coupled
with fear that now the military victories
might lead again to a peace made by a
country divided, an executive without hon-
or in his own house . . . a peace that would
be but a truce.

Certainly to our allies the situation
must look black. Their leaders have dealt
in person with the President. The personal
amity between the three allied leaders was
a potent factor in the compromises made
at Yalta. Because of the vast power that is
vested ill a war-time president, combined
with his ability to command cooperation
from other branches of the government,
Roosevelt was able to make certain prom—
ises and commitments and the allied lead-
ers knew tllat the country would follow
him in these commitments. A new presi-
dent at this time has the same powers, but
we do not know if he will have the same
influence. He is an X quantity. ‘

Can he carry with him the confidence
placed by the people of the United States
in his predecessor? Has he the back—
ground of intimate knowledge of interna
tional diplomacy that twelve years of ex-
perience at the helm gave to Roosevelt?
Can he steer through the treacherous reefs
that must be avoided to establish the
world‘s new dream of security alld cooper-
ation?

Only if the allied leaders feel that we
as a nation will support the new president
will his word carry weight ill the countless
negotiations that must be carried out be-
fore security is established. It is implaus-
ible that Roosevelt did not consider the
possibility of death when he decided to run
for a fourth term. When he accepted
Harry J. Truman as a running mate, he
must have known that there was a more
than even chance that this man would one
day be president of the United States.
That he did accept the one-time senator
from Missouri must be our certification
that in him we will find a man that can
lead us for the more than three years that
will elapse before we will again choose a
president.

(in an indirect sort of \Vay) for
the very select showing of Mitch,

A fifteenth century slap-stick
comedy Pierre Patelin. is one
of the few remaining plays from
the Italian commedia dell'arte.
This form, was an outgrowth of
the ancient Roman clown burles-
quc. it oontincd to be papilla-r
)for nearly four hundred years,
and was played by troops of trav-
eling actors all over Europe.

Half Masks Worn

Commedla dell'arte Was always
played in halfsmasks which left
the mouth free for dialogue, and
each player wore the same cos-
tume and mask whatever the
place or situation. Thus develr
oped such stock characters as
Pierrot and Pierrette, Harlequin,
|and the traditional Graybeard. As
each player troops' Version de-
veloped through the years, these
characters changed.'but they are
still recognizable as a form of the
old commedia character.

media dell'arte is ”improvised

drama.” The players had in mind
a certain scenarito to follow, but
the dialogue was improvised
during the action: The Grinnell
production will not use improvis~
ed dialogue, but a great deal
of the pantomime will be left to
the discretion of the actor,

Modern Forms

Modern forms of the ccmmedia
dell'arte are the Olson-Johnson
type of production, with its chin
plot, rowdy comedy, and pre»
dominate slapstick, and the
work of Charlie Chaplain. The
beloved Charlie became an Amer-
lcan institution through the use
of the stock character of the
unchanging wistful tramp who is
,the same in all situations.

The modern animated cartoon
also has some of the climacter-
istlcs cf the old commedia, and
the college theatre production
will attempt to preserve this ef-
feet.

The play will be acted Without
intermission against a unit set
ting. The unit set represents
three different places by the
moving of the action from one
part of the stage to another, and
by the raising of a. section of
the scenery to reveal another
section. Not confined to the
‘stage alone, the action will at
times include the whole main
floor of the auditorium.

Music, Play Share
Radio Spot Tues.

A variety program will be the
entertainment sponsored next
Tuesday by the Grinnell College
radio party from 4:05 to 4: o.

The first section of the broad-

Cast will include several musical
numbers. Mary Elizabeth Wilson,
a popular entertainer at campus
programs, will offer some vocal
selections as her contribution.
Christine Smith will play the
cello, and Lillian Ackerman will
be the featured pianist of the
air show.
Mary Ann Hursh, Alice Powers
and Barbara Macoubrey will en—
act a radio play for the re
mainder of the twenty-five min»
lite broadcast.

Stuart Roeder, who has stepped
into Lee Kidd's position as cam-
pus reporter, will also give a
brief review of the college news.
After the program, the musical
trio will make recordings for the
