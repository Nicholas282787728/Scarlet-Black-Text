From Library. I884 - -

Change Of Hear’r

By Verlyn Reese

Goodnow Hall. present location of
the physics department. was built
as the college library in 1334, one
of the first buildings rebuilt after
the tornado in 1882. Grant 0.
Gale. head of the department, has

his office in the room which was

formerlthe librariml's office.
The physics laboratory was the
reading room. The circular stairs
to the third floor led to the
stacks. In 1904, when the pres—
ent library was built, the physics
department moved into Goodnow
from its former headquarters in
the east side of Blair.

The physics department is one
of the oldest in Grinnell college.
Some of its early equipment for
experiments in electricity and te-
legraphy was brought here when
the college moved from Daven-
port, prior to the Civil war.

The department offers courses
in general college physics, ine-
chanics, electricity and magne-
tism, meteorology, optics, and
electronics. These subjects are
receiving special attention today
due to their importance in the
war effort. Electronics is funda-
mental to radar and all

developments in this field were
discussed.

The physics enrollment is the
smallest it has been for years,
and Mr. Gale makes up the fac-

professors helped him teach the
army. At the present time Gen

Cyclone Calls For
Grinnell' nsI Snaps ,1

Do you have any snapshots of
Grinnellians in service, of stll»
dents’ activities during the sums
mer vacation, or of students ac-
tivities on campus? If so, lend
them to the Cyclone.

Barbara Buckley, editor, has
issued a call for snapshots. “The
supply of film is very limited this
year," she said. “We would like
to use good pictures taken by the
students."

Mary Enid Frye, Haines jun-
ior and associate—editor of the Cy~
clone, will be in charge of collect-
ing the snapshots.

Junior and senior pictures for the
Cyclone will be taken soon. Ap-
pointments for individual sittings
will he made by Louise Mayer.
Haines junior, and Marjory Nunn,
Haines senior.

but the sad truth is that they
would not last at all on a high-
way beacuse they have been sit»
ting unused for twelve years and
have partly rotted away. During
the recent rubber drive the phy»
sics department collected $26
worth of scrap metal to contri-
bute in place of them,

Ren’ral Pic+ure Collecl’ion
Growing Sieadily Since '37

The new pictures which are
brightening quad parlors and stu»
dents' rooms are part of the
Grinnell picture rental collection,
which has grown from one por-
trait in 1936 to the thirty-nine
fine reproductions of modere
French and Amex'lcan painting in»
oluded in the collection today.

Available to all interested stu-
dents, the pictures rent for nome
inal fees. which are used to en-
large the collection.

The nucleus of the collection
was Van Gogh‘s Portrait of a
Young Man. which was purchased
with department funds and im-
mediately rented. Because of the
intorest shown in a possible pies
ture rental library, the Carnegie
corporation gave seventeen color
reproductions to the college in
1937. Since then. the collection
ha. continued to growl Represent
ed in the set are such outstanding
arti ts as Matisse. Gauguin, Pi-
casso, Franz Marc, and Grant
Wood.

Faculty interest in the pictures
has made them available to fac-
ulty members during the summer
months. although students are
given first choice for the college
year.
