scenes by Jean Paul Sartre,
French Existentialist philosoph-
er and writer, will be given Fri-
day and Saturday evenings, Apr.
8-9, in ARH auditorium. it is
being/presented -by Mr, Kent

the help of the Grinneu Players.

Since “No Exit" is not a part
of the regular college theater
schedule. there will be a small
charge for tickets. Ticket sales
will begin in the balls Friday,

With Hell as its setting, “No
Exit” shows Sartre’s concept of
what happens to tour people
who do not live up to their
moral responsibility to act and
think without fear. Two casts
have been chosen trom the class.
Each will give one performance
and act as crew for the other.
