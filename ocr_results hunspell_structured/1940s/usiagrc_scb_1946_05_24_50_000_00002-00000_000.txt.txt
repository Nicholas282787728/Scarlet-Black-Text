It never has been. A valid reason? Not in
our opinion. And the world will just get
more and more hungry.

Speculations on a R. R. S’rrikel

The prospects for a long and drastic
railroad stl- e are not great. Before the
strike can paralyze the country, the gov
crnnlcnt will take steps, or lilanag’emcnt will
capitulzltc. But it is interest 10' to speculate“
about uhat would happen il us had not
train service for several months

Each community would have to become
sufficient unto itsell‘ Buyers and sellers
could range only as 1211 zls thei' automobilesi
would take them, and this distance would
depend upon how much gas could be truck-l
ed and piped to gas stations The large
amount now shipped by rail would for all
practical purposes cease to exist.

Large cities would soon run out of
food. It has been estimated that New York
City would be footlless ill three days. Small
communities could get subsistence from sur—
rounding i'arms, and because these farms
could not ship produce for, they would have
much to sell to the surrounding towns, at
low prices because the supply would be so
great. The economic clock would soon be
turned back to the presrajlroad era, and we
would learn to live again in small, self-
sufficient communi ies.

To some, this is a horrifying picture,
to others, a longed for return to the till—
complex old-fashioned society, Most people
experience the first reaction, and we learn
that we are chained today to the giant that
we created to ship our goods. Our cry for
“things" drives us. Strikers who can para-

said, but'it is llopcll that they

Commenting on the Blltish film
l'el'smn of Blithe Spirit which
plnyetl at a downtown theater
last weekend, Andrews stated that
tbnt production interpreted the
play as sheer fantasy, while the
college performance will treat it
as farce. Much of the dialogue
will be the same,

It's Our Money - -

A new way to send food to Europe has
been proposed by Grinnell students, a pr c-
tical way which would result in a cash gift
of $2500 for relief. .if the plan were allow-
ed to go through. This is the plan: Student
board is paid through the 9th of June. Most
students are being asked to leave on June 5.
Figuring that about 500 students will leave
on that day, it is a matter of simple arith-
metic to determine that meals for 500 at the
rate of $1.25 per day for four days should
leave the students‘ account a total of $2500.

Many students are heartily in favor of

DORIC

A COLUMN 0!“
PURE BEAUTY

Well, we finally reached the
last lap in this dear old column,
besides maybe a Squib for the
big commencement issue, and we
brush away a Wee tear of regret
as we prepare to record our last
words at the year about people
and things. . . . .

This big Clark shindig of last
week end turned out to be quite
an affair, in spite of that nasty
ol’ weather man, And we could

not help noticing a few 11er

faces grinning at each other
over a big, juicy steak mean»
ing those of Bobbie Wright and
Bob olabby, Joe Henry and Ia
Rue Deitz, and not so new, but
just as grinning, those of
Walther and Bob Harness.
Sounds like Wedding bells-a.-
ringirr up there in July some-
where for Peg Watson and her
catcher-deluxe, Jerry Dover.
Likewise for Phil Klstler and her
"friend" in the navy whites.
It’s too bad, it seems to us,
that all foreign ,relations can’t
be as completely successtul as
our own example of sameiﬁou
Arvidson and Norma Robinson.
We just can’t seem to pin Ed
Walsh down to one get]. Maybe

it’ll be Dottie Dose — maybe 01»l

go — maybe Fran. Who can
tell? One twosome we'd mark
for a sure thing, though, is that
of Anne Royal and Chuck Mac-
Murray. Mighty nice!

Now comes the pay-off—tradj-
tion says that we sign our last
column. We, the undersigned,
have at times given you the
word on the word in this col—
umn. While you're counting ten,
remember our motto “AW,
gee, fellas, it was all in fun!"
