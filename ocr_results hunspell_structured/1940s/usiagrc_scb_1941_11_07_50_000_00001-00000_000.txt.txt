I Drafl Dance Slated
Selective Service

By Kenneth Stanley.

This weekend the shadow of the
selective Service board looms near-
the Grinnell campus.

The situation, however, presents
a more Serious aspect than it did
last October, in the opinion of
James mles, director of the Garb
about club.

ND leniency will be granted this
time. No exemption will be granted
to allow thc cringing male to
follow more scholarly pursuits.

Saturday at B p. m. the Gada-
bout's present their "Di-aft"
dance, and, whiic the male occu—
pant of the campus is being lull-
ed into s. false sense of security
by the sweet music of Bill Mear-
don and his band, plans will be
laid for inducting him into ﬁne
“life of the party."

The induction will take place
under the direction of an even

more relentless pursucr than the
local draft board — thc Grinnell
coed.

At the beginning of the dance
it will be the duty of each fem—
inine participant to register her
date for a period of selective ser—
vice, Miles said.

At intervals during the dance
draft numbers will be drawn and
the lucky draftec will be allowed
to entertain the dancers.

Upon failure to fulfill the quali<
fications his punishment will be
no less severe than that meted
out by an army firing squad,
Miles said

There is no reason, however,
for those who are selected to
abandon all hope. For they will
find, as has many another un—
happy draftcc, that army life
isn't so bad after all. ~

Taps will sound at twelve p. m.

Thanksgiving
To Be Nov. 27

Cut Rule Will Be
In Elfecl- Over
Holiday Weekend

Crinncll will observe Thursday.
Nov. 27, as Thanksgiving Day
rather than November 20 as pre-
viously announced, according to
Dr. Henry S. Conard, dean of the
faculty.

No classes will be held Wed<
ncsday afternoon, Nov. 26, Con-
nrd added.

The rule provlding for a. ﬁve
dollar ﬁne for each class missed
on its last meeting before or
its first meeting after the re-
coss will be strictly cnforcod,
he stated

Canard explained that Thurs<
day, Nov. 20, appears in the col-
lege catalogue and on the Grin-
nell blottcrs as the recess date
because Iowa state authorities an
nounced last year that the offi-
cial Iowa Thanksgiving would be
on that date.

But the Iowa date has been
changed to November 27,

Grinnell will observe the offi-
cial Iowa holiday.
