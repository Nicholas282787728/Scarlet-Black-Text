Luce Is Founder
of Time, Life

Magazines

Henry R. Luce, commencement
speaker, and chairman of Time,
Inc, publishers of Time, Life,
Fortune and the March of Time
motion picture presentation. is the
man credited with the develop
ment of the modern, abbreviated
and Vilallzed style of newsre-
porting in his own news maga-
Zines.

With a Yale c c iato, Burton
Haddcn, Luce loiindcd the first
publication of the type, Time, in
New York in 1923. Devotmg’
themselves to the progress and
problems industry particularly,
they organized Fortune less than
a decade later. One of the high-
est p cod publications in Almeria
ca, Fortune, at a dollar a copy,
weathered the severe tleprtssion
into which is was launched, and
was immediately successful.

These are only two of the
achievements or this man in his
early forties. Life magazine, the
ﬁrst of the present multitude of
picture magazines, is perhaps the
most spectacular 0[ his projects.
Issued in 1936, with a guaranteed
circulation of 250,000, it now is
sold to over 3,500,000 every two
weeks.

In addition to his journalistic
enttrpriscs, Luce is also responr
sible tor the radio and screen
versions of March ol Time.

Luce is the son or an American
protossor who spent most or his
life teachisg in China. Tiicre
Henry Luce was born, in Tcng~
chow, in 1898. He was educated
in this country, at the Hotchltiss
School, Lakcville, Conn, and at
Yale, \
