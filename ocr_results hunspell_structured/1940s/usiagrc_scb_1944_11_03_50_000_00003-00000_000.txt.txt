Everyone agrees that the ring on

the signifigance behind the birth

It's high time someone ques-

here.

Dr, Huntley Dupre, former pro-
fessor of history at the univer-
sity of Kentucky, became execur
tive secretary of the World stu-
dent Service Fund on November
1, according to a report from that
office. He succeeds Miss Wil-
mina Rowland, who is resigning
after three years With the WSSF
to serve on the staff of the Eu-
ropean student Relief Fund, the
WSSF’s administering commits
tee. Miss Rowland will leave
sometime after the first of the
year for Geneva, Switzerland.

Dr. Dupre has a background
of student relief work since
World War I, when he was di~
rector of the Studensky Domov,
a great international student un-
ion in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
This union had a self-governing
membership of twenty»seven na-

mester, a proposal was made from
the floor that upperclass women
be allowed to smoke in their
rooms. Miss Trowbridge said that'
results of a poll taken last year
showed that a majority of girl
students did not smoke. She sug-,
gestcd that if smoking were per-
mitted in rooms, the smokers
might be‘changed into student
rooms, adding that a girl who
did not smoke would be annoyed
if her roommate smoked, or if
a group of girls came in and
began to smoke.

In reply, several seniors stated‘
that the majority who do not
smoke need not be bothered by
the few who do, and that the
other questions are roommate

dividually.

Miss Trowhridge promised that
the question would be discussed

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

The editorial in last week's Scar-
let nnil Black brought into the
open a complaint which many
students have been making inl
past weeks. However, it failed
to make the distinction between
the length of assignments and
the degree of difficulty of the
work,

It is quite true that we are in
college not just to play, but also
to work. We are willing to stu-

must necessarily be of a more
difficult grade than high school
work, and we will accept hard!
assignments without complaint.
However, we do resent being
forced to do assignments which,
while they are not really hard,
are of such length that we must
spend all of our time on them.
Surely the way to intellectual
discipline does not consist of
long hours of study; it consists
of a caliber of work that will
train the mind. If we were cer-
tain that the work we are do-
ing were getting us somewhere,
we would not complain, but would
do it gladly in the hope that it
would be of some value to us.
But why must we work hoursl
on assignments that hold for us
neither extrinsic nor intrinsic
value?

It may very well be true that
we don't work hard enough, in
comparison to the students at
many other colleges, Neverthe-
less. we work tor longer periods
of time. It is not our fault if'
we become disgusted with having'

Praises Dewey; ICriticizes Roosevelt

The following is an excerpt from an editorial entitled ”Mr.

Christian Century:

tial advance in social legislation but the administration of the

legislation previously enacted and the whole sp'

it and conduct

of the government present a fair, field for analysis, interpretation
and criticism. That Mr. Dewey intends to center his fire there is

evidenced by his promise, if elected,

to apply a new broom which

will sweep through the jungle of proliferating boards, bureaus and

administrations.

operation, and encouraging a much needed spirit of consultation
and cooperation within the government and between the govern-
ment and the groups whose interests it might be seeking to safe-

guard.

"From the very beginning, Mr. Roosevelt has used deception
as a major political stratcgern, until today he has lost the moral

confidence of the nation.

Even in the ranks of those blocs which

represent his followers, his support rests not upon their confidence
in his integrity, but upon the cynical assurance that he will serve
their interests because their votes are necessary to his mainten-

ance of power.

“The poison of this cynicism courses in the bloodstream of

our body politic,

It can be thrown off only by the emergence of

the people, regardless of partisan differences.
