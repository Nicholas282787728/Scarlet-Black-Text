0 Music Looks Up

The conspicuous progress that America has
made in the appreciation and performance
of good music in recent years is apparent to
all. The high quality of music presented in
state and regional contests of high school
bands and orchestras, the phenomenal in—
crease in sale of the recorded classics are
only two of the evidences of this trend.
Students here at Grinnell may well ask
whether the college is sufficiently aware of
this trend, and what it is doing to satisfy
this awakened interest. '
The Scarlet and Black is happy to re-
port that the music department does have
plans to develop those students already
musically inclined and to draw out the latent
ability of those not so gifted. In the first
place, the band and orchestra will be greatly
expanded because of the recent purchase of
large numbers of new instillments, because
of superior leadership and the enthusiastic
backing of the administration, Membership
in the Men‘s Glee club has been enlarged by
fifty percent to include more and more ap-
plicants. Mr. West’s plan for an unre-
stricted Grinnell chorus will make it possible

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

for additional students and many townspeo—
ple to reap the benefits of participation in
music. President Stevens is even suggest
illg the possibility of including all freshmen
in some form of musical activityl

Not the least of the benefits of this ex»
panding musical program are the satisfac-
tion a student feels from sell’vexpression and
the pleasure of group activity. Not only may
we produce an oratorio or symphony inspir-
ing to others, but we may also have a lot of
fun in doing it. Needless to say, the appree
ciation of music thus gained will grow and
enrich our later years.

The administration is providing new fa-
cilities and hearty backing. If we students
will hike advantage of these opportunities,
the future of music at Grinnell is unlimited

O Resurrection Day

Considered as a whole, the spirit displayed
at the Lawrence game last Saturday night
was such as to offer considerable encourage
ment to those seeking relief from the chron-
ic lassitude of past football seasons.

Curious to examine Coach Douglas‘ team
in action, spectators from both town and
college filled the Memorial stadium well
before the kick—off. But what was more
noticeable was the fact that with few excep-
tions they remained in the stands until the
final gun. Even the period between halves
saw the stadium well-filled, a situation for
which the band deserves the primary credit.

Nor was the crowd content to remain a
silent witness. Led by the section of pep»
filled freshmen, who spontaneously assumed
the functions left unfulfilled by our apathetv
ic megaphone-totem, the crowd rolled cheer
after cheer into the night air.

And that is what we like to see For it
indicates that the Grinnell spirit is emerg-
ing from the coffin G~

Willkie Buttons
Hold Majority

New Instrumen’rs
Bought For Band

Democrats Are

ALL Buttoned

Over Roosevelt
By J0 Smith—Republican

Have you noticed the many
political buttons suddenly pervade
ing the campus lately? Are we
really party»minded or are we
just backing the party of our
ancestors?

A recent survey showed that
Willkie buttons are by far in the
majority on this campus. Our
loyal young Democrats attribute
this lack of spirit to the fact
that their buttons had to be sent
for. or course, say the Roose-
velt hackers, the Republicans
must realize that they are so
hopelessly outnumbered that it
isn’t necessary to emphasize the
minority. However, it might be
noted that no Willkie pins had
to be ordered because the sup
porters or this business man, who
worked for his high position, had
enough foresight to prepare for
an extensive campaign.

“We had to send for our
Roosevelt pins" said Mary Ellen
Appleby, when asked about the
lack of spirit, “but We have them
now."

New talent and more financial aid
were announced by band director
Robert Vagner to he a great help
Lowzu-ds building Grinnell a {me
band. Forrest West, supervisor of
the music department, has made it
possible for the hand and orcheslm
to obtain new instruments played
by student musicians,

’These new instruments include
two cuphoniums, an oboe, bell
lyre, bass, French horn, two cym-
bals and two tring basses. Four
cellos and s harp were repaired
and are in excellent condition.
This wnl be the first year that s
harp has been used in the band.

In addlllon the department in-
tends to buy six Clarinets, six cm-
nets and string instruments to be
used for beginning students.

There will be no additional fee
tor these classes. Any student
who has not joined these musmal
organizations may do so at once.

Congratulations! We hope that
they can be given away before
the campaign is over.

Ah, well—in the meantime, we
poor Republicans will be singing
”Can’t Get Indians or: My Mind."

Says Democrat

By Mary Ellen Applebyi
New Dealer
Jo Smith, in her article, shows
ardent it not thought‘ul, support
of her party. "The old time reli-
glon” is good enough for her.
However, Miss sinlui failed to
mention that the Republicans.
while they constitute 96 per cent
of the student body, do not seem
spirited enough on behalf of their
party to wear their easily-pro-
cured pins, The Democratic 4 per
cent, on the other hand, unlike
the Republicans and unlike the
average Grinnell woman, is al-
most 100 per cent pinned.

”VVe have definite headquart-
ers," Miss SmiLh Slated. "whereas
the Democratic headquarters have
only a temporary office.” She did
not seem concerned over us fact
that these “definite" headquarters
are situatcsi in an alley, aptly
enough it seems to us.

In distributing Democratic pins
to the loyal collegiate supporters
of that party, we Will be care-
tul to save one pin, to be given
to Miss Smith on election night.
