GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Problem

Revealed By Miss-Gleason

The hazards and perils ot he-
ing a dietitian in \l'arelec Grille
nell are not to he lightly dis-
iiiissccl, Miss Nellie Gleason, the
lady who plans our meals for us,
has a hard job, but she does not
complain Here is the inside dope,
as reported to the Scarlet and
Black by her attic

To begin with, the most seri-
ous difficulty to be met is in the
rationing program. Those four
little red stamps in our ration
books have to go along way each
week. Out of the sixteen points
allotted to each student must
come butter (which is 16 points
a pound, in case you didn't know
it), meat, fats for pastries, oils
for mayonnaise and cooking, and
canned soups and such. But even
if there are plenty of points saved
up for meat, it's hard to tell
what kind of meat is going to
be available, '

In these dear, dead days be
fore the war, Miss Gleason was
able to buy meat such as best.
by the carcass, and it was then
divided up after delivery, But now
that bogey-man from the ope
says no dice. So Miss G, huys by
the cut. She can order anything
she likes, when the points are
available. But she can't always
get what it is she wants, In fact.
she never' knows just what it is
we are going to have in the way
of meat until the truck unloads it
at the Quad kitchen. Perhaps
some of you meat crazy students
wonder why in tarnation we got
beef for a week and then pork
for a week, and so forth Miss
Gleason gives the explanation
that in one week she will he able
to get only beef, and in another
only pork.

“The balancing of the student’s
diet is the most essential thing,"
Miss Gleason stated. If no meat
is forthcoming, then fish or eggs
or chicken is used to supply the
needed protein. But the student
who sticks to the Quad diet can
be certain that he is getting the
required number of calories and
vitamins and such.

Luckily for Grinnell, Miss Glea-
son said, there have been plenty
of fresh fruits and vegetables
available. Apples, grapes, pearsl
and plums have been relatively
easy to get; but oranges and
grapefruit are another matter.
That shipment or bananas that
came in last week-end was as
much a surprise to the food de-

purlmclll as H. \\'rl~ ‘0 the glue
“81116, illf‘idcntally.) Tomatoes,
carrots, cabbage, and lettuce have
been served in abundance. The
poor cauliflower fiend, on the
other hand, has heen thwarted
for cauliflower is just about the
most cxpensive vegetable on the
m a r k e t. Generally speaking,
though, the fresh foods have been
very easy to get, so there is a
good supply of canned goods
stocked up for use in the winter.
when transportation dlfticulties
make it hard to get the green

‘artlcle.

The milk‘ shortage has heen due
principally to the fact that more
milk is being drunk these days
than ever before. Also, large
quantities of it are being dried

ruii, however, Miss Gleason mall-
ages to see to it that we get 2117
most all we would be drinking in
peace time anyway

When asked about the turkey
situation in relation to our
Thanksgiving dinner, Miss Glens
son could give no definite word
on the subject The government
has released plenty of our [came
ei-ed friends for civilian consump
tion, hut the hitch comes in the
transportation
nell‘s order has been in for a long
time, however, and if turkey is to
be had, the college ivill.have it.

Potatoes? on, we have lots of
those. The college grows its own.
so the Quadites will have plenty
of starches to help keep up the
old waistline.

“The students have been good
sports all along,” said Miss Gleae
son, “although maybe the food
isnt exactly as good as they
would like it to be" So although
meals like mother used to cook
are out for the duration,
nell’s food department carries on.
And nobody seems to be any the
worse for the change.
