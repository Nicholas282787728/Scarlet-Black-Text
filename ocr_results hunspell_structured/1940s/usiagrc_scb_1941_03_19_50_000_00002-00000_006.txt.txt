Annually the Purdue chapter ol Sigma Delta Chi, national professional
iournalistic society, sponsors the Riveters' Rassle, a costume dance and
opportunity for the campus he-rnen to sport their bearded laces. Using
the bowery theme brought out hilarious costumes, saved the girls a lot
ol worry about "what to wear". Tickets, which sold as usual lor
$1 991/2, were in the lorm ol a summons to a night court, and the ran
edition of the college paper which annually accompanies the allair was
named the “Police Gazette" in keeping with the bower theme. A
Varga girl in lull-page engraving adorned the cover of t e Gazette,
which was printed on pink paper.

Personality, physical attractiveness, and "stuff" are the requirements lor the “SDX
Stuff Queens". The trio selected by the journalists this year are, (left to right),
' Merle Hagemeyer, Jean Jones and Frances Kramer.
