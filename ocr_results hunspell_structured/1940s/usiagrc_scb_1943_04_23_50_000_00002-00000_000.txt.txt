Remember April 2|

'That was quite a meeting Wednesday night.
It was, on second thought, one which may
prove of some value to the future of student
government ill Grinnell. Regretably, the
Value will be evidenced only as the scconda .
interest of the meeting; it will, in effect be
quite a surprise to anyone who attended the
session. But it may develop, nevertheless.

It seems to us that the real issue at hand
was personality and politics, not conduct
and constitutionality. But if clarification of
the constitutional relationship of organiza-
tions on this campus comes out of the meet-
ing, ,whether deliberately or ac. dently, the
two and one half hours of pavty caucus ate
mosphere were not in vain.

The constitutional point proved in our
opinion, was the inherent superio 'ty of the
student council as an organization, and of
its constitution as generally interpreted, over
any other organization or constitution on
this campus. This is important, for the posi-
tion of the council as the students’ coordinab
ing body has been ignored often, smiled at
occasionally, and never adequately stated.

In fact, the highly solicitous interest 9 '-
pressed Wednesday on the part of both fac—
tions for the sterling constitution was a
thing of wonder. Our nasty, critical mind
keeps wanting to remind us that two weeks
ago few of the persons of either camp who
rallied round the council in this meeting
would have been too prone to extol the sur
perio ty of that group. But, one must not

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

be too unforgiving in times like these. This
is the “Malice toward none, charity toward
all" period of the war If we have erred bo-
l'ore in not recogliizllig‘ the impor illcc of
the council, let it be forgotten, for nclecd
recognition has been thrust upon us. For
the future we can remember that on the
evening of April 21, 1943, the issue was face
ed and the superiority granted. Let us re—
member it like everything and every-
thing! Because again our critical mind wants
to say the whole thing may be soon forgot-
ten in the exigencies of campus affairs.

To preserve this decision, which is of Value
to student government, let us fix the date
in our mind. April 21. Everyone thinks the
student .council is the real bigew’ Like the
Alamo, the Maine, and Pearl Ha bor, let us
" lememher April 1.”

Peace, it's wonderful.

No Second Cup - -

h my students have noticed, with no little
indignation, that they are being cheated at
dinner. We ‘efer t0 the coffee situation. We
hope we are not being unpatriotic in bring»
ing a rationed article to the fore. But the
purpose of rationing is being defeated. That
is why we speak. The government has stated
that the idea behind rationing is to provide
everybody with the same amount of restrict—
ed items. That is as it should be.

Wily, then, we ask, 1‘ not every student
allowed at least one cup of coffee for dinner ".7
If we clamored for two, we would be out of
line. We only ask equality.

Every student has deposited his coffee
rationing stamp 7 plus all the rest 7 with
the college so that they may be assured
their fair share. Every student does not
drink coffee. Many of the men do not eat
breakfast at the Quad because they live in
the town houses.

These two factors: not all students drink
coffee, and many men do not drin’ coffee
at the college in the morning, con lice us
that we should have at least one cup at
dinner. The situation which causes dismay
is this. IF coffee is available, there is not
enough for everyone at the table. IF more
is brought, it is Very cold. IF more hot col?
fee is served, you are through with the meal
and out of tilezdining room. Therefore, we
propose that the kitchen department plan
their co e distribution more effectively so
that ration stamp holders get their quota.
We only want it hot and with the meal; we
don't want a second cup.

 

much. Sending greetings to an Mrs, Blanche 5, Leonard, Hallie:
