trumps: the mane? You should have seen the one on this
soeial lion beicre he switched to Wildroct Creamroil. Xt was
positively beastlyl So may we paws to make a suggestion: try
a little Wildtoot Creamed hair tonic on your own hair. You'll
rear with approval when you see how it groan-ls your hair
neatly and naturally without that greasy, plastered dcwn look.
How it relieves dryness, removes loose dandruir and helps you
pass the Fingcrnail Testl Wildtoot Cream~0il is non-alcoholic
and contains soothing Lanolin. Ask your barber tor a pro.
fessional application And get a bottle or tube for your den
today. You'll ﬁnd it at any drug or toilet goods counter. we
aren’t lion when we say you’ll like it better than any other
