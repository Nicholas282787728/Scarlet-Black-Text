Forever Kelly

The Kelly Stables Revue of ’47 was
certainly deserving of editorial comment
entirely in the superlative. The very fact
that the show was actually presented, by a
hall whose members are actively engaged
in all the other phases of campus life, is in
itself commendable That it should have
shown such talent, originality, humor, and
good taste, places it definitely at the top
of the list of all student activities this year.

Andy Schill is to be doubly congratur
lated for the time and talent which he de-
voted to mold the show into a production
that was greated by students and faculty
alike as one of the best evening’s entertain-
ments Grinnell has seen for a long time.

Caution To Voters

During the national campaigns of 1948
we will find presidential candidates posing
in motor launches off the Florida coast,
catching stuffed fish. Several will become
the great‘white father of publicity-hungry
Indian tribes. Perhaps Lauren Bacall will
be persuaded to perch on the piano of her
favorite candidate. These tricks are part
of the usual high-pressure campaigns which
strive for the attention of easily-swayed
Americans, but they are rarely taken seri-
ously.

In a humble Grinnell way, candidates
for the Student Council presidency have
sought your attention during the past week.
Such publicity campaigns are an enjoyable
part of the excitement and color of election
week, ‘but we must allow them to obscure the
true issues at stalre.

Candidates who blithely promise a
moon of green cheese in exchange for your
vote are as unrealistic as the voter who
expects a moon of green cheese when elec-
tions are over. Our hope to the contrary,
the Student Council president has bllt
limited power, and no pleading on his part
can change certain college rules and regu-
lations. Think carefully before voting for
a candidate who promises beer in every
housemother’s suite,

The Scarlet & Black does not wish the
title of wet blanket, but certain facts must
be faced. The ability to wear a Wolgemuth-
washed sweater like a man of distinction
is not the prerequisite of a Student Council
president, nor must the future president be
a gazelle on the dance floor. Marital status
has little or nothing to do with the presi—
dent’s position ’as a student representative,

 

 

.a class, a hall, or the enti e student body?

Dear Mr. Leo Gruilow: ,
For the frankness and sincelity so evi-

dent in all your contacts with the Grinnell|

student body, and for your generosity andl

patience in answering our questions, we feell
ourselves deeply obligated to you. For theI
knowledge of Russians and Russia that you
shared with us, we are grateful; but of
even greater importance in ollr eyes wasl
the dispassionate spirit with which yourl
material was presented. I
For all this, and for the great privilege
of being able to share to some extent the
benefits of your al‘duously acquired knowe
ledge and understanding of this highly coli-
troversial countryiwe thank you.
Signed,
The Grinnell Scarlet S: Black?
