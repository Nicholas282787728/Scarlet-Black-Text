Not So Fast, Please

A fine and well-carried out job was done
by Robert C. Young, president of the Stur
dent Council, in presiding over the first ses
sion of that new and enlarged group meet-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ing for a three hour session last night at
Carney house.

However, the sell—appointed triumvirate
of the Council, Young, Jane Goplerud, and
Jerry Fort, are subject to criticism, not for
what they have accomplished, but in the
manner in which objectives have been at,
tallied.

It is not too generally knoun by the stu-
dent body that the Student Council never
formally passed the proctor-ing system that
aroused so much comment during examin-
ationsr How many students realize that the
pl'oetol's were paid forty cents an hour and
that the Student Council is supposed to pay
half the bill? The Comic, until last night,
“as never notified that it was expected to
foot that sum.

Furthermore, the legality of closing the
White House has been somewhat of a source
of mystery to the Scarlet and Black, which,
along with the Student Council constitution.
has been under the delusion that the social
center was supervised by the White House
committee who were in turn responsible to
the Student Council. The White House “as
closed, not by the colnmitteerin-charge, not
by a vote of the executive committee of the
Student Council, bllt after the action had
been “suggested” to Young by Dean Shelton
L. Beatty. The recreation center was shut
down after short discussions with Miss
Goplerud and Fort,

Such methods, although efficient, are not
democratic, and so long as the Student Coun-
cil has a constitution, it is suggested that a
closer observance of procedure be followed.

MINORITY REPORT

The new and enlarged Student
council, unable to let the proctor
system die a natural and deserv—
ing death, Tuesday blew a fresh
breath of life into the corpse.
Not yet brought to a vote by the
Student council either before e.-
nminutions or after, the proctor
origin seems to be slightly illcgh
timntc. Perhaps, ll. would be
fair to award the Friars the
fatherhood of the plan. At any
rate, the Student council is ex-
pected to share the cost of the
salaries of the proctors with the
administration.

Basimlly ilic jurisdiction of the
Student Council on the question
of proctor: stands on unccrmhi
ground. From all indications ii
LARGE majority of the student
body is against n proctor system
for some reason, cithci- emotional,
coonomlc, or otherwise. Some of

League Board
Discusses Clubs

The League board met with
beads of all women‘s organiza-
tions Monday evening to discuss
the advisability of discontinuing
some of the less active clubs, and
the merging of societies which
have approximately the same pur-
pose,

A suggestion was put forth to
corporate organizations under
gi‘uel‘al headings, such as sports,
hobbies, etc. The assembly decid-
ed that a council should be
chosen to bring about more co-
operation between the Quadrangle

and the Dormitory clubs, r

CATHOLICS MEET SUNDAY

The Catholic club will hold a
meeting next Sunday, Feb, 16. to
discuss next semester”: social pro-
gram sud to draw up the con-
stitution of tlic club, Alice Meyer,
vice president, announced today.

the Council members have been
frank enough to agree that such
may he the case, but they argue
that students should be educated
to appreciate their problem hnd
that a solution is oh! so essential.

By a vote of ‘17 to 5, last
meeting, the group tabled a resoV
lution to discontinue the proctor
system, From the discussion, it
had become apparent that dutiful
Council representatives should
sally forth on the quixotic mis»
sioii of convincing their various
constituents that prcctoring is
peachy! If this he the job of a
representative, then in reality the
Student council becomes a sure
dent hierarchy built along Platonic
lines and should not be confused
with such a. democratic word as
representative.

The grim seriousness with
which some student leaders set
down and propose in mi evening
or so to clear up any human
evil which is put before them is
indeed astonishing. We prov Him:
ilic present Student Counci docs
not start to solve the social proh-
lom. They might seek to nliolish
sex.

had been taken, it was the opin-
