nursery have been established by
enthusiastic botanists. The “bot"
garden is located just south of
the campus, off highway 6, borv

The college nursery, situated
north of the swimming pool, has
been used as laboratory for bor-

Beginning botany and a sur-
vey of the plant kingdom are the
two courses being given how.
Under ordinary conditions classes
in fungi and plant recogni-
tion would also be held. Avail»
able to students working in hot-
any are the herbarium and the
moss collection along with Dr.
Conard‘s personal library on mos—
ses. Members of Grinnell‘s botany
staff have been on collecting
trips in Europe, Canada and the
United States. For students,
field trips have always been an
important part of the work, sup~
porting the theory that “plants
should be studied where they'
grow.” These trips have been
limited recently due to gasoline
rationing.

From the botany side of hi—
ology we go to the zoology de—
partment across south campus
to Blair ball. Located in the
upper east side of the building
are the lecture room, laboratories
and museum where zoologists can
find specimens, microscopes and
all varieties of equipment with
which to work. Dr. Harry W.
Norris, professor emeritus of
zoology ,was a member of the
department for fifty years. His
teaching of prermedics courses

Wilson, Roeder
Aronson Top Poll
For Best Acting

On Friday and Saturday nights
when the play, Moor Born, was
given, a preliminary poll was
taken to determine the best ac»
tor or actress of this year. i

Mary Elizabeth Wilson receiv-
ed the greatest number of votes
in Blithe Spirit; Annabelle Aron-
son had the majority in Ladies in
Retirement; and Stuart Roeder
topped the cast of Moor Born.

Since two more plays, Brief
Music and Master ptcrre Patch-i,
are yet to be given. the recipient
of the award of the best actor
of the year has not yet been de-
termined.

Mary Elizabeth Wilson, James
sophomore, played the part of
Madame Arcotti, a spiritualistic
medium who brought back ghosts
but didn't know how to control
them.

The laughable, red-wigged Miss
Fiske was portrayed by Anna-
belle Amnson, head senior, in
ladies in Retirement. Her stage
life was ended at the hands of
her housekeeper while she lustily

cord.

As the drunken, degenerate,
Dranweil Bronte, Stuart Roeder,
Pine Tree freshman, depicted the
erratic and despondent brother
of the famous sisters in the pro—
duction of Moor Born.

The three plays were produced
and directed by Kent Andrews
and Elizabeth Ineffler of the
drama department.

The Ben Eranklinites in the
group who believe in “Early to
bed, early to rise" are at present
being challenged by the beauty

course, stay up all night to see
if the glee club really does wme

About a quarter to eleven,
bright veils, spring like flowers
and high heels will own to
emerge from the quad for the
Easter parade to

thoughts of the season, Dr. Stev-
ens has chosen “King of Kings
and lord of Lords” for his top-
ic. Nancy Morse and Mary Ann
Hursh are to be the student as»
sistants. Music for the service
will include a violin piece play-
ed by Mr. David Peck and sevr
erai numbers by the glee club
with Katehrine Looms as soloist.
The choir will not sing. The
chapel decorations, which the
YWCA is arranging, are the tra-
ditional Easter lilies, presented
by each cottage, Read plans to
send its gift to the hospital and
other dorms may follow suit.

If Miss Gieason's plans work
out, special food concoctions will
be enjoyed. The League Board
is in charge of Easterrfying the
dining hall, and there will also
be special music in the drawing
room after dinner.

Although the afternoon vespers
have been cancelled, the Easter
bunny wiu not return to fling
chemistry and history books in
front of many who will be tak-
ing to the open road. Some unin-
hibited students may be walking
barefoot through cool ,green
grass. For others there will be

forgot the bottle opener, beside
