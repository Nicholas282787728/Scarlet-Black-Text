HANS KOHN

What are the real issues at stake in the pre-
sent war? Of what importance is the
Russian and German threat to the Balkans?
What are the actual political, social, and
economic forces that have brought about to-
day’s international dilemma? Which nation,
if any, is likely to win the present war? Is
collective security of nations possible in the
modern world? What kind of peace can end

this war?

These questions and many others are con-
stantly plaguing any person who is interest—
ed in the affairs of today. Most of these
questions will never be entirely answered
except by observing the events in the future,
but Grinnell will be favored for the next
month by a well known authority on inter-
national al'fairs, especially in the Near East,
who can go a long way toward giving an
adequate answer to the above questions.

Professor Hans Kohn, born in Czechoslo-
vakia, educated in European universities,
author of several books on Near Eastern and
world affairs, and professor of history at
Smith College, is a welcome addition to the
faculty of Grinnell. The Scarlet and Black

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

”A job well done is one that is done with
honesty and integrity. Setting a goal for
ourselves and accomplishing it can mean
nothing if we do not infuse the agesold vir-
tues of honesty into our methods. Dishonor
in trivial things soon leads to deceitful ac»
tion ill major issues, and we suddenly
awaken to the fact that we have been steep»
cd in the iguominy of a corrupt set of mor»
EllS." Lawrence College’s Pres. Barrows
urges collegians to maintain honor above all

else.

“It is my conviction that the best training
is afforded in the regular courses of a lib<
oral education precisely because, when
taught by sound scholars, they combine Wide
scope and critical detachment and therefore
are more lastingly effective. I would indi-
cate especially courses ill history, political
science, economics, sociology, logic and phil-
osophy. Students may thereby come to know
the past and the present, to judge evidence,
and so to be on guard against current pro-
paganda in print and over the air." Uni-
versity of Cincinnati’s Pres. Raymond Wal-
ters prescribes the best antidote for threats
of dictatorship.
