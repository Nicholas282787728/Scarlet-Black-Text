0 A Fable About Fascism

Once upon a time there was an ideal state.
It had football games every Friday and
varsities every Saturday, and everyone
could do whatever he pleased and never
had to Worry about having his rights 111'
fringed upon. The football team always
won, and the chzlperons left the varsities at
half-past eight. Now on one Saturday
night after the football team had won by
an especially large score ov its second
most formidable rival—on this Saturday
night, after the chaperons had stuck in
their heads and departed, there was much
gaiety. No one knew quite how it hap-
pened, but a baseball game began right 11]
the midst of the jitterbugs; and after peo-
ple had smashed most of the lights by
firing baseballs at them, some of the boldest
decided to aim at the leader of the orches-
tra, who was struggling to keep the inuSlc
going in training for air raids. After several
tries they knocked him down. There was

something of an uproar; a few people who
had been brought up that way tried to act
shocked, but most of the others, who had
been brought up that way too, were de-
li lited because they saw their repressions
coming out. Meanwhile one member of the
orchestra had sneaked off and told the
chaperons, who appeared and tried to act as
if they had been there all the time and had
just now been able to make themselves
heard. But the others knew, and they
shook their fingers at the poor qualiing
cliziperolls. “It was your fault," they said.
“How were we to know that we were
responsible 7"
G

So sadly the chapel‘ons apologized and
announced that now the lights were all
broken and the members of the orchestra
hzid resigned in a body, there could be no
more Saturday night celebr tioiis. They
added that the members of the ideal state
had shown themselves unworthy of being
what they were called, but they gave the
first reason in order to be sure the citizens
understood they were being punished; and
it was a good thing, because as soon as
they understood that, the citizens went
away, pointing their fingers balefully at the
person who had finally succeeded in hitting
the orchestra leader.

And immediately they began to reason
among themselves. They were so busy
reasoning that they did not hear the chap,
erons ask them what they thought of their
punishment Even if the lights were broken
and the orchestra had resigned, and even if
Saturday val‘sities were forbidden, they
were scarcely hampered. They could buy
new outnglass chandeliers and hire Glenn
Miller's orchestra, and they could have
dances on Sunday night just as well as on
Saturday. In fact, they were convinced
that Sunday night dances would be even
better, and they told the chaperons so; it
would make the ideal state even more ideal.
“But you forget this is no longer an ideal
state," said the chaperons; whereupon they
were drowned out with shouts of “We want
Sunday night dances." The chaperons looked
sorrowfully at their proteges and went
home. They are there still, reading books on
“How to Become a Dictator."
