‘We Must Be Good’——Seckel

By Virginia Finite
An appeal for Americans to pre-
serve ethical and moral values
was the theme of Dr. Alfred F.
Secltel’s speech to the post-war
seminar Tuesday evening in Good-
now Hall. Dr. Sechel is a special
lecturer in German for tiie ASTU.
He began his lecture by show-
ing colored slides of Germany
and Switzerland. In a short
speech he described the spiritual
lack among European youth clUSr
ing with a plea that American
youth hold fast to traditional
standards.

“It is not a question of whether
you want to be good." Dr. Seckel

 

said, “You have to be good or you
will bring harm upon your neigh—
bors or your children. It is un-
rortunately true that many inr
nocents suffer for the wrongs ot
their predecessors.”

The competitive sp' t and the
proht motive which, according to
Dr. Scckei, have assumed too
much importance in human are
fairs, are responsible for much of
the turmoil in the world today.
He expressed the hope that the

modern youth will respect unselfv :

ishness and intellectual attain-

tainment.
