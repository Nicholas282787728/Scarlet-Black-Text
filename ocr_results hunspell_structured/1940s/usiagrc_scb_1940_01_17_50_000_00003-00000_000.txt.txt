By Thom Kuhl.

The shortlegged reporter, dodg-
ing around to keep out of die
way of flu germs, discovered;

That in a composite box score
of all the sports in the Missouri
Valley the Pioneers finished in
third place with an average of
3.75. The golf team paced the
Grinnell athletics in their last
year in the conference when it
finished second to Washington
university of St. Louis, Mo.

That Drake, our traditional rival,
finished in fifth position, mainly
because the Bulldogs failed in
swimming, tennis, and g olf.
Creighton occupied last place in
the sports table.

x s e
That Arden McClain, one of the
prospects for the Grinnell coache
ing job, has quite an impressive
record as the head mentor at
North High school, Des Moines.
He has a four—year football aver—
,age of .781 with 25 victories, five
defeats, and two ties.

a s e
That James Nash is averaging 20
points per conference game, hav-
ing scored 80 points on 36 field
goals and eight free throws. Nash
is so points ahead of last year’s
leading scorer, Wilbur Duick, who
set a record of 167 points for the
season.

a e a
That the average number at fouls
called per game is 14 with Jerry
Fort and “Hap” Kendall leading
the offenders with 25 and 27 fouls
respectively.

a s e
That two Midwest ounierence
schools that seem to be challeng-
ing Grinnell for the conference
title, Carleton and Ripon, both
play the Pioneers here on the
home court. Ripon plays here
next Monday night.

Tim Cornell, the hard luck team
of the Midwest, has finally taken
the role of lack the Giant Killer
and upset Carleton last weekend.
