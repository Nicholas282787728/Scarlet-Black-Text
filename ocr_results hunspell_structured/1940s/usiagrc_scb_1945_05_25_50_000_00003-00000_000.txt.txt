GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Novel Se’r For Pierre PaI-eIin -

 

Pierre Patelin
Scores Success

By Gerry Warren

The commencement play, Pierre
Patelin, presented May ls by the
Grinnell college theater, is a hie
larious medieval farce that kept
its surprised audience in a cone
tinual uproar. With a repeat
performance scheduled fol: to»
morrow night at 3:30, the play
ers have spent the last Week pol-
ishing their already excellent per-
formances.

The tirst shock of the evening
was the set, which is entirely
different from any yet construct
ed by Kent Andrews’ production
class, Extremely stylized, it
iuts out from the state at such
an angle as to‘ preclude any use
of a curtain or scene changesi

i

Instead of the latter, a sliding
front on PKicrl-e's home located
center stage, allowed the action
to shift from his bedroom to the

I draper’s shop to the court of jus-

tice without panse. The set is
oolortul mu! imaginative, quite
in keeping with the mood of the
ilay itself.

An boyemeetsegirl, girl-wins-
boy interlude opcned the action,
which was continuous throughout
the performance. This interlude
introduced the moin action, which
which centered around the trou-
bles of one M. Patclin, shyster
lawyer, and his intrigue to obtain
a new suit of clothes. In thd

course of the action, he becomes

cdly stupid shepherd, and is out:
\vxtted at his own game,

Ann Jacobson
Patelin with Imcsze and gusto,
The exaggerated gestures and
unctuous tones were an integral
part of a fine characterization.
Jewell Brimner, as the draper,
also put her heart into her per—
formance, and very successfully.
Nancy Watts played the pompous
judge, whose justice was "tem.
pared by cash” and by the presA
ence of a curvaceous courtesan,
played by Betty Lou Johnson,
One 0[ the highlights of the play
was the courtesan’s descent, dur-
ing the trial scene, into the hue
thence, to perch on the lap of
an amazed spectator,

Delight Walker was Madam ‘
Patelin, and wept and wailed and
aided her conniving husband with
due devotion. Elaine Beer, as the
shepherd, added considerably to

Patricia Abbott
Marries June 3

The wedding of Patricia Abbott
to Dr. B. w, Kingrey will take
place June 3 at the home of the
bride's parents in Osceolai The
brlde’s only attendant will be
her sister, Ann. Music for the

\

doletul gestures and heart—rend,
mg “baaa‘s.”

Extras in the cast or twenty-
five were from Mri Andr'ews'
production cast, and did their
part in upholding the action.

The really unique production
ofiered something entirely new
to the college audience. It mow
ed rapidly and lightly, and the
colorful period costumes and
novel half—masks were a further
asset. Although it moved no
souls, was not dramatic nor pro-
found. it was thoroughly enjoyed
and appreciated.
