New Cheer Awarci
’ ystem Suggested

Sl'uclen'l Council

Proposes Class
In Cheer Leading

A plan to better the rewards
given to cheer leaders has
been proposed by the Student
Council, campus governing
organization, and will be pie
scnted to G. Lester Duke, direc-
tor of intercollegiate athletics, as
“soon as possible,” according to
Robert c. Young, president oftlie
organization.

.Plan Given.

Under the new plan, cheer lead-
crs, after two years' effort. would
receive a minor award, not yet
determined. At the end of three
years, a major award would be
given,

The proposal also calls for a
class in cheer leading to be con-
ducted by the head cheer leader,
who would be selected by a com»
mittee consisting of the Student
Council Pep committee, two Pep
chairmen from the freshman
class, and a representative from
the athletic department.

Class to Be Arranged.

This class would probably meet
at least one ho-u a week for six
weeks during the football season.
Young said. It was also hoped
hy the Council that attendance
in the class could result in phys
ical education credit.

Under the existing plan, the
only reward given cheerleaders is
a sweater, which comes at the
and of three years‘ scivicc with
the cheerleading squad,

Cheerleaders at the present
time are selected by the campus
Pep chairmen, Young stated

Wafer Color Technique
Of Sheels' Painlings
Praised by Slernfeld

Millard Sheets, noted Ameri~
can water color art t, whose
we is now on display ill
Main hall corridor, has one of the
finer exhibits that have been
brought to Grinnell, Miss Edith
sternfeld, assistant professor of
art, stated yesterday,

Miss Stemfelcl went on to say,
"Sheets is noted for being en-
thusiastic about whatever is par-
ticularly interesting at the mo-
ment, and probably because of
this Characteristic, he always has
lieves his last painting to be the
best.” it is probably also due to
this trait that we notice a var-
ieLy of techniques in his collec-
tion, she added.

Paintings Reveal Realism.

slicets' paintings of pure land-
scapes and buildings are marked
by realism and extraordinary
color. Most typical of these are
“James Slip" and "Spring." In
the less realistic ones, horses are
added for their decorative value
only, as in the picture “Pi‘een—
ing." “Echippiis” has the theme
centered about a horse, and is
purely decorative and lacking in
color, she said.

Miss sternfeld concluded her
criticism of Sheets' work by say»
ing, “While most of his water
colors are distinguished for their
exceptionally fresh, 'wet‘ quality,
the decorative pattern in ‘Thc
Boy' and The Gil'l' has been
achieved by a dry brush tech-
nique. The mural designs which
were clone for the Golden Gate
Exposition are both intricate and
detailed. and give us an idea of
Sheets’ pencil technique as differ-
ing from the effect of a com-
pleted water color.”

NO CHORUS TONIGHT

Grinnell College chorus will not
meet tonight, because of the
Gates Lectures.

Coeds Decide
Circumstances

Do Alter Cases

By Jeanne Lay.

Uiiforeseen circumstances have
made it impossible for the upper-
class girls to have their house
party Saturday night. The docs
tion that arises is, what shall
they do in place of the formal?

Because of the same circum-
stances, quite a few of the girls
Will be in study hallefrom 7:30
until 10 p. m. Saturday, as well
as Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday and Fri-
day, The rest, however, have var—
ious plans,

Solne of the girls who are “re-
leased" at 10 will meet their dates
then. The lucky co-eds who have
all evening to waste will either
go to a show or to the Raven
with their dates. A few of the
girls are planning to go to Coe
for the wecloend, and still others
are going to go home.

'No matter what they do,
though, all of the girls will be
thinking about the house party
that wasn't, and dreaming of the

, one next semester. Wishful think-

ing? Let‘s hope not:

YWCA Cabinei Enferiains
Dr. Crane A+ Lunch Today

Dr. H. H. Crane, Gates lecturer,
was entertained at lunch this
noon in the Quadrangle by the
Young Women's Christian asso-
ciation cabins. After lunch, Dr.
Crane held an informal discus-
sion in the drawing room.

The Y, w. c. A. cabinet also
held a dinner for Dr. Crane in
thc Quadrangle Tuesday night.
Following his lecture in the
chapel. he rcturnsd to the Quad-
rangle drawing room where he
spoke on “Ways and Means of
Campus Religious Activity."

‘Chrisl‘ianity Is What You Are In Your Innermost Self, ’
Says Reverend Henry H. Crane At First Gates Lecture

By Russell Cain.

“Christianity is lifeinol: what
you do or say or feel, but what
you actually are within your
innermost being." Th was the
Reverend Dr, Henry Hitt Ci-aiic's
answer to the question "What is
Christianity,” the title of the first
of a series of lectures he will
deliver in Herrick chapel as the
annual Gates lecturer at Grinnell
college,

Dr. Crane went on to enumerate
the four groups whom he termed
as “out of the reach of God."
First, he said, there is the vast
indifferent major y who do not
know what Christianity is and
do not seem to care, The second
group according to the speaker.

is composed of cosmopolitan in-
dividuals who “regard golf and
religion in the same category and
of equal importance,"

Then there is the group, Dr.
Crane says, “who are definitely
antagonistic to the church and to
religion, because they actually be-
lieve that they are being sup
pressed by it." The fourth and
final group is “violently opposed
to religion, on the grounds that
it is a superstitious practice," he
said.

Going on to list creeds of
religious practice. Rev. Crane
mentioned the crceds of "right
conduct,” and of "emotional re-
sponse to religion." Referring to
the latter group, Dr. Crane said.

“Religion without emotion is like
cold, dead beauty chiseled in
marble, but this emotional re-
sponse to religion is not Christian-
“y,

“We are floundering around to-
day in a dying world, because we
oursclvcs are only about 90 per
ccnt alive," Reverend Crane maiir
tained. “Since Christianity is
life, then we are Christians only
to the extent that we are alive,"
he said.

Dr. Crano will give four other
lcctures as a part of the Gates
lecture series, and will conclude
his stay on the Grinnell campus
Thursday cvening to return to De-
troit, Mich, where he is pastor
of the Central Methodist church.
