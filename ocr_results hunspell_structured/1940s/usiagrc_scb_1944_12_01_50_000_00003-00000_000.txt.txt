of the movie to be shown at the; Mrs, Leslie Patton, ’20. said
Science club meeting on Monday that at the second conference of
in the chemistry lecture room. lthe United Nations Relief
.Rehahilltation Administration. l'e-‘
‘oently held in Montreal. a bitterl
‘argumcnt resulted in the decismn‘
‘to give aid to Italy, in spite of
the fact that Italian troops hadi
caused great suffering to Balkan
‘countries which are members of
UNRRA. Although Yugoslavia
and Ethiopia asked reparations,
and punishment for Italy. they
lvoted to grant aid for Italian ex-
pectant mothers. babies and
-wounded soldiers.

l Among problems faced by
‘UNRRA, which was set up for
the temporary relief of war-
stricken countries, Mrs. Patton
llisted relocation. mass repatrir
ation. resettlement, and technical
assistance in rebuilding, as well
as the pressing problems of obr
.taimng food and medical sup-
plies. The American share
51.300.000,000 in the UNRRA
‘fund has already been paid. and
‘it was pointed out that the Unit-
ed states .will make nmney from
UNRRA through selling to for-
eign countries.

Mrs. Delmar Ahrens described
the petroleum agreement conclud-
cd between England and the
United States this August as a
temporary. preliminary unilateral
agreement which should be ex
tended in the future. It provides

estimate world demand for oil
,and recommend ways of meeting

i she attributed the slowness of the
United States senate in accepting
the agreement to the opposition
of pressure groups. notably some
representatives of American per
troleum industry.

Comparisons between the old
League of Nations and the United
*Natlons. as established by the
Dumbarton oaks agreement, were
made by Mrs Charles Payne. The
principal difference consists in the
organization
to use force. Settlement of dis
putes may be made by economic
sanctions, by cutting off all com-
munication with the offending
nation, or by military action eith-
er through tlie international ai
force or the chiefs of staff of the
Big Five nations on the security
council: Britain. the United
States, Russia. China, and France.
Another new feature of the Unit-
ed Nations organization is its emr
phasis upon studying economic
and social condltﬁms.

Although she adnntted that the
veto power which one of the Big
Five may exercise .was a defect.
isince it would allow an aggressor
nation to veto its own punish-
ment, Mrs. Payne urged the ac-
ceptance of the agreement. She
said further modifications will
probably be made and affirmed
that it is not alone the machinery;
it is the will for peace which pro~
duces results.
