Major subjects discussed by the
representatives included student-
faeulty lelations, set-up of van

events and special activities
sponsored by student Councils,

fairs, the delegates agreed et the
first panel discussion Friday at
lLel'noon. However, the group dee

not consider students mature
enough to accept too much re-

They agreed also that students
have the ideas, but do not want
to take the responsibility to
carry them through. More assere

more unified, interested student
body would help solve this prob
