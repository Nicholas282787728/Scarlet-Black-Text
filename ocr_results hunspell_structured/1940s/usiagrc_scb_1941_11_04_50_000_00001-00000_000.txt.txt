An amendment to the pres—

The new plan involves the elec-
tion of four sophomores to assist

pose of the plan is to have exper—
ienced juniors at the head of the
annual next year, she continued.

Two editors and two business
managers will be chosen in a
sophomore class election from the
candidates approved by the Pub-
lications board, the proposed
amendment states.

Treasurer's figures show--

Big Business

Govemment expenditures and de-
fense construction booms have
nothing on 'Grinnell. ﬁgures re-
leased hy L. v. Phelps, college
treasurer, reveal that Grinnell too
is big business,

The annual milk, cream and
butter bill of the college is ap—
proximately s20,000, according to
Phelps. Any Griunell co-ed knows
enough mathematics to be able
to arrive at the conclusion that
fifteen thousand pairs of Nylon
hose could be purchased for that
amount of money.

or each graduating senior girl
could be sent out on the job
with an expensive new fur coat.
But the money goes to dairymen

The jelly and jam bill which is,
according to Phelps, about $1500
yearly, would buy a streamlined
convertible. Any resident of the
dormitories can figure that out.

The jam and jelly would fill
four or five standard size bath-
tubs, But who wants to bathe in
preserves?

Anybody anywhere knows that
$81,000 will buy 75 high-grade

automobiles, 1,620,000 cokes, or
162,000 lipsticks. That is the
amount which the college spends
for food annually, Phelps said.

Glenn Miller and Tommy Dore
sey could be brought to the
campus every Friday and Satur-
day night of the year for the
amount of the annual heating
and lighting bill of the college.
‘That amount is approximately
$72,000, Phelps said,

The monthly payroll of Grin—
nell college has now reached a
peak. It is now between $28,000
and $29,000, Phelps said. That
makes approximately $342,000 a
year, or enough to pay the salary
of the president of the United
states for two years, with enough
left over to build one large army
tank or buy two chinchilla coats
or pay Bing Crosby's yearly radio
salary.

Reliable sources indicate, how-
ever, that it is extremely unlike-
ly that any of these more fanci-
ful purchases will be made. The
money will probably again go for
operating expenses,

Council Lisl's
Prepping Plan

Cosl‘umes Will Feature
Sa’rurday Porlion
of Hell Week Program

Gi-iiinell preps will take on some
of the outward characteristics of
women, children and monkeys
during the Saturday morning por-
tion of Hell Week, according to
Kenet Pearce, president of the
council of house presidents.

Preps will be wearing over-
shoes and short pants, lipstick
and mascara, and oversized pink
hair ribbons. Their accessories
will consist of umbrellas, mechan-
ical toys and alarm clocks.

Pulling a mechanical toy on
the end of a string, each prep
must skip cvcrywhere he goes.
An alarm clock hung around his
neck will ring every hour. At the
call “timber” from any upper-
classman, he must scamper into
the nearest tree.

Friday night the freshmen will
entertain open house guests in
their respective balls with impro-
vised skits.

These plans were set up by the
council of house presidents at
its meeting last night, Pearce
said.

Courage Praised in
Borrowing $90,000 for

sides changes in physical equip-
ment, Stcvens spoke of changes
in curriculum and a revitalization
of alumni.

between 8 and 10 a m. is up 40
per cent, and the faculty is work
ing 25 per cent harder, according
to Stevens. He attributed these
changes to the new curriculum.

said he had spoken to every Grin-
nell alumni group in the country
and had made speeches to 26,000
people at 64 gatherings.

,In the report, he referred to
the reconditioning of the men’s
dormitories and the construction
work on Cowles dormitory as
tangiblc proof of the changes in

Are Women Careless? No, Declares
ARH Clean-Up Man Charles Huff

Lost and Found
Indicaies Thai More
Male Items Are Losl'

The traditional belief that women
are more careless with personal
apparel than are men was chal-
lenged today by Charles Huff,
janitor in the Aumni Recitation
ball.

Huff, who says that he has sal-
vaged articles from the class~
rooms ranging from text books to
hobby-pins, claimed, however, that
men's coats formed the major
portion of the lost and found
turneover.

Approximately 100 articles are
found each month in the class—
rooms, Huff said. These are then
turned over to John M, Bridg—
ham, professor of Latin, who
places them in the ,Showcase at
the south door of the ARH, where
they remain until claimed by their
owner.

Turnover Is High.

“Saturday I picked up three
men’s coats, four mufﬂers, two
books, and a belt from a woman’s
coat," Huff said.

Cigarette cases, fountain pens,
textbooks, and men's hats were
also listed as being the objects

most often left behind.

"Night Must Fall" is a play
which demands a good cast, or it
becomes a farce. And the cast
in this production was without
exception, excellent.

James Gardner in the lead role
shone like a hundred watt bulb on
a dark night in Merrill Park.

His interpretation of the homi-
cidal bell boy, a difficult role,
proved that he is one of the best
actors to be seen on the Grinnell
stage for many years. Whether
he was actually on the stage or
not, the force of his characteri-
zation dominted every scene.
