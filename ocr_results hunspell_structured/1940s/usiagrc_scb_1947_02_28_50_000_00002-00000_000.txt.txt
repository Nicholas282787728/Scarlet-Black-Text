To Mr. Duke

We should like to express our sincere pleasuic
at hearing that Les Duke is to remain 0'" the
Grllulell campus. in a position involving close
contact with the student body. Mr Duke has been

loved by Gi-iiinell .students since he began his
coaching career here over twenty years ago, and
lit was riot without extreme regret that one stir
dentrbotly learned of his recent resignation as i
rector of Intercollegiate athletics, .

We tend our congratulations and best wishes
to you in your new position, Mr. Dllke'

We'd Like To See.

There comes a time when we feel it is our
duty to register a protest against certain eiristing
conditions on this campus, and offer suggestions
which we believe will meet with the approval of
the strident body, without appearing outrageous
to the administration.

with the traditionally rainy spring before us
we should like first to consider the problem or
sidewalks leading to ARI-l. There is a place for
pools, and a season for ducks, but the central
campus‘ of Grinnell college during the academic
year is neither. A sidewalk from the southeast
door of ARH to the Juncture of the sidewalks
leading from the women’s gym and the library
would eliminate the common scene of students
picking their way through three or four inclnls
of slush and water, And while we are on that
subject, a sidewalk from the bookstore to Aer
would also be helpful, .

We agree Wlth Miss Gleason that the dining
rooms should be reserved for very special dances,
but we should like to point out that Nat Towles‘
band lifts the Cinderella Ball into the realms of
special occasions, without its being a formal
dance. Since about half of the women and 95%
of the men voted in a recent poll to have the
dance informal. we should like to register the re-

of the evening.

The coordination of timepieces on campus is
still nonexistent, and confusion invariably reigns
at class and meal times. We suggest consistent
regulation of every clock on campus, and more
exact ringing of meal hells. -

The Student Council has recently considered
asking for casual dress permission in Ulla dining
rooms Saturday evenings, since many students
would rather dress for later dates after dlnr
her. We believe this would be convenient to the
student body. as a whole. and would like to ad—

LeHers To
The Edi+or

Dear Edttor,

Following the appearance of
my name among the ten 50‘
election candidates, 1 have had a
serious talk with Murray Lawson,-
and find that our views on stu-
dent government at Grinnell are
parallel. My full and active sup-
port, thereforc, is now behind
Lawson for the office of Student
Council president.

This decision on my part was
not a snap decision, but one of
conscientious reasoning. I believe
he is the man for the job.

My letter of declination is now
in the hands of Maxine Hey.

My thanks go to all those who
voted for me in the original baJ-l
loting. {

Yours very truly.l
William Casteriine

Dear Editor,

I have just sent a ietter to
Maxine Hay, chairman of the
Elections committee. announcing
my resignation from the current‘
Sic presidential race, and inten-
tion to support Murray Lawson.
My declination to run was ex-
pressed last Monday night. when I
told the Langan housemceting
that I did not wish to .be a (Ea—nth»
date, and although very grateful
for the support I have received
;on the campus, my decision re-
mains the same.

‘Of the remaining candidates,
Murray Lawson inost fully ex»
presses my views on student,
government, and I sincerely be-‘
licve that he will fill the position

Dear Editor,

Following is the essence or a

llctter which I have already subl

mitted to Maxine Hay, president
I am currently carrying an ac-
ademic load which would prevent
my devoting enough time to neci
essary preparation for holding of\
rice next year. ‘
I feel that, if different candi-
datcs hold views which are funda-i
mentally the same, the total ef-
fect on Crinnell is better with the ‘
candidates working together. i
than working individually. -
For these reasons, I wish to I
withdraw my name from the list
of eligible candidates, and to
announce that 1 shall give Mur-
ray Lawson whatever support I i
am able.
with sincere thanks to those
who saw fit to support me in
the primaries,
Sincerely,
James A. Scott
