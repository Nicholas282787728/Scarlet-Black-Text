STUDENT HYPOCRISY

Early ili December, Martin Dies, chairman
of the Congressional colnlnittee investigate
ing un-American activities, summoned be-
fore his group officials in the American
Student Union. At that time evidence was
presented, and Union representatives ad-
mitted, that some positions in the group
were held by Communists, but vocifcrotlsly
denied that the org nization was Comniun~
ist controlled. As if to clinch this colitcn»
tioll, Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a
statement asser ’ug her belief that the
group was not dominated by Communist .#
so much for the Congressional investigation.

The scene chaug s to the fifth annual
conven ion of the Unioll held ill Madison,
Wisconsin, last week. On December 25), a
peace resolution, which wollld merely have
branded Russia as the aggressor ill the pr —'
sent conflict with Finland but suggested no
action against her, was put before the
assembled delegates for a vote. The result
was a 322 to 49 rejection

To us, this vote illustrates the acme of
blind and crass hypocrisy. It had been our
belief for some time that radical groups in
this country were noted for the shallow
mummery of their position, The American
Student Union, by its ridiculous stand on
as clear a case of aggre -ion as the world
has ever seen, shows that it like many
other “liberal and progressive” groups,
libels both the terms “liberal" and “pros
grossive" and sliovcs this movement into
the same category as the Liberty League—
uarrow, prejudiced, bigoted partisans.

A more prurient or wanton attack on
a smaller nation can hardly be found in
modern history; and it took Russia, the
champion of the weak and the defender of
world pence, to beconle the wolf in a world
already fllll of mad dogs.

. And Russia was not even clever about
its shamcle s act. After browbeating
Latvia, Lithuania, and Esthollirt into yic1d«
ing up thei independence or be torn asun-
der, Russia’s contention that 11,000,090
Finns were being provocative and war-
mongeriug, aftcl t at coul gcous country
had failed to submit to the me dishonor,
able terms that wiped out the independence
of her three i'ster Baltic states, is one of
the crudcst, most unpalatable lies that any
nation has ever tried to defend as the truth.
The same uncouth, bullying bluster that
Germany had used on Czechoslovakia,
Poland, and Austria, Russia used against
Finland when she said, “Our patience is at
an end; we will defend ourselves against;
attack."

It should now be clear to any impartial

observer that the red banner of the ham—
lncr and sickle can no longer be vicwed as
leading the march for freedom or defense
of the weak. The flag is Just another rag
with which the Soviets wipe Off the bloody
sword of impcrialistic lust.

With all believers in world morality
\oiciug their horror, contempt, and utter
amazement at the Russian bear becoming
the beast that it is, no have in America a
group at" disliw ter intellectuals, in the
guise of liberal-thinking students, unable to
brand 2 in agib or the country they love
so lunch. They mu. investigate further to
see whether Finland or Russia is the agg-
r or, they declared, while at the same
time they othusiastically condemned Japan
as the tig_l'oss0r in China, and denounced
Fiance, Great Britiau, and Germany as
being “imperialistic” and “acting against
the interests of democracy and smaller
nations."

125 YEARS OF PEACE

(Excerpts from a leaflet, Orzo Hundred and
Tit-olzty-Fr've Years of Peace between the
Liiitcd Stat ,3 of America and Canada, pre—
pared by the Wolizl Al 71cc for [ma m-
tional Flicndslup throw/IL the Churches.)

The War of 1812 between Great Britain
and the United States came to an official
end on December 21, 1814, wllen the Treaty
of Ghent was signed. This Treaty, how'—
ever, did not; stop the naval race between
Canada and the United States on the Great
Lakes. nor did it stop the illcr ig num—
bor of forts erected on either side. Two
men felt that this condition should end.
Their names were Richard Rush, Assistant
Secretary of the Department of State, and
Charles Bagot, British Ambassador to
Washington Largely as a result of their
negotiations, the Rush-Bagot Treaty came
into existence and was proclaimed by Presi
dent Monroe on April 28, 1818. Great Bri—
taiu and the United States, by this agree
ment, brought to an end the fortifications
of the border, and limited ships of war on
the Great Lakes to one small ship each.
This Treaty, which followed the Treaty of
Ghent by four years, has governed the rce
lationships of Canada and the United States
ever since, ‘nd is a monument to the faith
of its 01' nators that all controversies
should be settled by peaceful negotiation
without the arbitramellt of war . . . .

It is a strange and tragic collu‘ideuce
that, as the plans for 'oiut celebration of
the one hundredth anniversary of the sign-
ing of the Treaty of Ghent \l'crc interrupt-
ed in 1914 by the outbreak of war, so the
plans made with such satisfaction and joy
for tile observance of the one hundred
twenty, th anniversary must be altered
because of the outbreak of war.

But, however painful the present state
of international aff'irs, and however re-
stlictcd the possibilities of ,' int ceremonies,
this noble anniversary must not; be allowed
to pass withollt real recognition and appre—_
ci‘ltion on the part of citizens of both collus
tries, Canada and the United States. Let
us hold to this splendid heritage, not only
because of \lhat it means to us, but be-
cause of what it moans to the world; for
the very future of civilization depends on
just such community of spirit, such justice,
coopel tion and goodwill, as have been
shown in the rela , us of our two countries
through this long pc od of unbroken peace.

They needed to investigate no further
to condemn the Dies committee for “its
attack upon all progressive orgaui' tious
including the American Student Union."

And then to show that they were good
Americans, the Union adopted a resolution
declaring, “Wearc opposed to the use of
federal or local police against minority
groups, particularly as against; the Com-
lnulnst party.”

They capped their resolution spree
with one urging thc boycott of thc mov lg
pictures, “Gone With the Will ” and “Birth
of a Nation”.

But Russia is s- cred, her intentions,
honorable, her actions, benevolent—well
said by a group of the nation’s outstanding
examples of pucrilc misrepresclltatives of
American students
