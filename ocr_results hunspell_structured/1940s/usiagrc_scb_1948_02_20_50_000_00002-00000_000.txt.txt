A Personal Matter?

There must he a way of appealing to

the Grinnellian's sense of honesty. There'

mlist be a way to stimulate oul nailing
spirit of integrity. The reference is, of
course, to the flagrant cheating that went
on during the last examinations Not only
did cribbing hit an all—time high, but those
who used this practice admit it candidly
and are able, with no effort at all, to ratiolr
alize their actions.

i The most common excuse tlle offenders
give is that they are forced to take courses
ili which they have no interest. So they
cheat because they don’t wisli to get any-
thing out of that study. In addition, they
attribute so much importance to grades that
the result is the subordination of learning.

Other time-worn excuses are used
to soothe their consciences. They plead
forgiveness on the basis that they must

cheat when others do ill order to pass,
, or that cheating is a personal matter.

Actually all these rationalizations can
be reduced to one simple factor. Certain
students are just too lazy to spend the re
quired time studying. It must be laziness
because anything that can be carried on
notes can be learned, and the questions
which require intelligence and understand-
ing cannot be answered even with the help
of three by five cards.

Cheating on exams does no olle any
good. The individual foregoes his chance to
enrich himself mentally, besides losing a
part of his sense of fair play. He entices
bordeiuline students to copy his actions in
order to get by, and he loses the respect of
those who compete I'airly,

Students must somehow be made
to realize two important points. First,
wiser heads than ours have decreed the
current curriculum. The many required
courses are designed to build well-
rollnded personalities Second, the
habits established during colle 'e years
are enduring. They will be can ed with
us for a long time into situations ill
which there will be no opportunity to
check.

Under present conditions one of two
possible correct actions must be taken.
Either examinations must be well enough
policed so that cheating is impossible, or
the honor system must be reinstated, The
former system is not complimentary to men
and women of college intellect and age
level. The latter system can be made to
work if the entire student body will co»
operate and follow the rules. Is anybody

On Casting A Vote

'Ihi editorial is llw first in « series designed

to clarity Im- students the procedures uml prin-

Ilcs involved in the approaching Student Collu-

L 21 on mimpuigu. It is hoped that the clue

year's Siliilcnl Council presulclll.

In two weeks it may be difficult for:

some of us to realize that the interestillgl

political pressures under which we find our-l
selves have grown to gigantic size in a mate'
ter of a i'ew day . Here at Grinnell the ma
jor political elections, like almost every

thing else, tend to assume a strictly black
or white tone with very few modifying
grays because of the highly compressed na-,
tins of college living.

The Student Council elections are pate
terned as nearly as possible after national
elections. This setup means that it is pos».
sible to gain knowledge in tle process of
campus electioneering. A little honest
horseetrading, it is felt, never hlirt any-
body.

Our politics ought to be useful to usl
for a year. The editorial board of the 8&1!
has deemed it wise ill this election year 01.
1948 to attempt to evaluate the gene al pro-
cedures, platforms, alid responsibilities im-
posed by student elections in order to aid
in gaining a more logical perspective than
is sometimes apparent.

T" llollt the actual legal pro
to es of the election, primary ballot-
ing, the electoral convention, and the
geller'l election, a great many loyal-

l w 1 come iilto conflict. Pressure
will, justifiably, he brought to bear
upon halls and cott s as groups,
upon individuals genclrlly considered
10 be influential, and upon the cliques.

As a student voice of sorts, our first
words of preeelection advice is, to til/e
wheels: bend your energies toward making
it a good, interesting, and, in spots, warm
election, blit do not lose your moral shi ts.

And to the cogs, check your loyalties
with something besides good lool's “per I
sonality,” and ”a friend of a friend of
mine,” both when hall representatives are
elected and “hen the final balloting- takes
place. .
