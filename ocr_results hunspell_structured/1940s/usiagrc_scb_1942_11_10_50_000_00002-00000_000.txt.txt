Not Ano+her Armistice-n

Tomorrow, Wednesday, Nov. 11, only short
notice will be taken of the 24th anniversary
of the Armistice of World War, 1, for we
are now engaged in another Such war, and
past victories, like past defeats, are lost in
the exigencies of this moment. Some com-
munities indeed have abandoned all official
commemoration of that day which signalled
the end of four bloody years; perhaps this
is the best plan of alli For We have grown
weary of drawing comparisons between this
war, and the last one Historians, in future
centuries, will class them together, with the
ones that may follow, as the Third Hundred
Year’s War. But to those of us whose lives
had not yet begun on Nov. 11, 1918, and
may scarcely reach to another war, the dis—
tinction is great.

We abandon comparison between the
two stillggles because we aren’t very happy
about what the first one accomplished; we
have higher hopes for what we may do in
this one. Comparing the two is a weakens
ing influence, not a strengthening one

For every delay, for every example of
mismanagement in our current effort we
can find parallels in the first World War.
How many times since Pearl Harbor have
we heard ”Well, it took lls a while to get
going in 1917, too,” or “After the Yanks
got in, the show was over,” or “We did it
before and we can do it again." 0. K. But
you can be sure that when that war was
Won it was won in spite of and not because
of any delays or any mismanagements or
any quibbling among allies And this con-
stant retreat into history to justify corre-
sponding present mistakes is one of the

tell you the news “isn't out, yet."
Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life: Ap-

things that must be eliminated if this war
is not also to bring forth its heir in twenty
years, even as it was brought forth from
1018.

Secondly, we don’t like the word Armise
tice very much. Granted it was a welcome
one 1918, even as it will be in 1944 or ‘46
or \Vhene\Y ‘ we see it again. But we think
it pl'ophe that we have always celebrated
the Armistice and not the Peace of World
War I. Armistice—a brief suspension of
host ies by agreement; not peace, which
is defined as harmony among nations, free—
doln from war, And just as we have been
celebating armistice, not peace, for 24 years,
it has been armistice and not peace which
we have possessed. The historians with their
Third Hundred Year’s War are woefully
right. We have had a short recess between
rounds, a breather, a “time—out.” But the
same game has started again. And because
we don’t like the idea of always another
round waiting for us every generation, we
would fight this round a little differently,
we would abandon that term armistice
We, who are doing the fighting this time,
would fight on until we get peace and not
armistice: peace, which is more than the
absence of war, but is the freedom from
\VBI‘.

It is portentous that in this week, so
close to Armistice Day, there should come
the first evidence of a. real American offen-
sive. The much heralded Second Front is
opening almost on the anniversary of the
closing of the Last Front We like that.
Whe hope it is indictive in other ways that
this war and this generation are taking up
where another war left off. And there is
a good deal of world-wide “mopping up”
to do. There is no victory in returning to
“status quo ante bellum” society if that
society itself is full of flaws.

There is much talk of the American
way of life. We would rather think of that
way of life as something to be worked for
and not something to be remembered. And .
we look for a real way of life to come out
of this war, a real demcracy, not just a con~
scions tolerance That is what came out of
Nov. 11, 1918. That is why we would like
a new Nov 11 in a new year, 3 Nov. 11 to
mean peace, not armistice, justice not '
”status quo ante bellum.”

And yet we in no sense decry that first
Nov. llth or the men who gave their hopes,
their efforts and their lives for it. We shall
not fire cannon nor march in parades to-
morrow We shall only join together in
reverence for the dead of that other World
War. From them, from their strength,
their sacrifice, and above all from their per-
sonal sincerety, as from the dead of anoth-
er earlier day, we shall take increased de-
votion. But it shall be to the new cause of
freedom, the real cause of freedom, not to
the remnants of a dead epoch and a deadlier
philosophy of superiority.
