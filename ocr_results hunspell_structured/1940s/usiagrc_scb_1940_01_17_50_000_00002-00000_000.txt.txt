Hilton)

We suppose that it‘s human nature for all
of us to think, now and then, that we’re ill
a pretty tough spot. Right now, with exam-
inations coming up, lollg assignments to be
completed, and outside activities going on
unabated, some of us have decided that :1
student’s life is a hard one. Anyone who
is in this frame of mind, however, can save
himself too much self pity by considering
the plight of a man (as yet unknown) who
will really have solne troubles to face. We‘re
talking about the new football coach, who»
ever he may turn out to be.

Accepting the job of coach here at Grin»
nell will put Ml'r ‘X behind the eightball for
sure. He will be expected to tum out a
winning tean'li Yet he will find himself
faced with a student body Whose defeatism
is traditionalr He will have to work with
a team whose record has not been impress~
iver He will run up against the problem
of training, the solution of which involves
getting the cooperation of the whole student
body—not that of the team alone. He will
find that the school’s athletic policy is that
all of its teams must be composed of fellows
who are in good standing scholastically, and
for whom none of the academic require-
ments are lightened He will soon leam‘
that many of the players work three hours
a day, in order to be able to pay part of
their way through schoolr In short, the new
coach is not going to have an easy time of
it by any manner of means,

The man who attempts to solve the dif-
ficult problems mentioned above has a right
to‘expect the help of the student body as a
whole. He stands a good cllallce of getting
it, since most of the students realize by now
that they must cooperate with the coach
and the teamduring the football season if
success is to be possible, The students
have always wanted our team to win its

games, but in the past they have never done
much to help, We think that their attitude
has changed. We hope it has, for it is our
firm conviction that even Iowa’s miracle
mall could not succeed here without the
constant support of the students. Let’s co-
operate with the man who is selected, He
will need all the help we can give him.

SCIENTIFIC DATING

Ev ' thing these days is rapidly becoming
a science so why shouldn't dating; become
olle, too? If winning friends can be a
science, and if books can be written on “The
Science of Eating” and “Science and Sanity,”
why can’t we say just a bit about scientific
dating?

rPel'Ilaps dating has been a pseudo-sci»
once for a long time; at least it has made
little progress toward getting out of that
stage since we’ve known it. But at least it
still has big possibilities to become a science
if we‘re willing to develop it.

There are many qualifications which any
activity must possess before it can light
fully be called a science. Important among
these qualifications are: it must have it
purpose, it must have a body of systematiz-
ed knowledge, and it must be open-minded.

Dating has long had as its purpose
mutual enjoyment. Nevertheless, a constant
round of dancing, attending movies, neck»
ing, and guzzling cckes becomes monotonous
and monotony destroys enjoyment A
scientific approach would therefore attempt
to secure avwide variety, Insofar as Grin-
nell tries skating parties, sleigh-rides,
square—dancing, ping—pong, and similar actis
vities, it is furthering scientific dating.

But to be a science, dating must also
have a body of systematized knowledge. Of
course a person would hate to pull a Dater’s
Manual from his pocket or purse to discovm‘
his next move, but one doesn’t usually catch
up on Emily Post at the moment, either.

Fulthermore, the data must be open-
minded. Since going steady is a good mind—
closer, it is a non-scientific procedure. Imar
gine a true scientist closing his mind to all
but one fact; he just wouldn’t be a scientist
any more.

Being open»minded, though, means more
than an unclosed mind; it includes seeing
below surface facts. On the surface, dating
has as its sole purpose enjoyment, but in
conjunction with, and deeper than that may
be a desire to allow this person to develop
his personality and social graces, and to let
that person see in you a different and better
slant on life. A scientific dater never
groans because he’s drawn an unpopular
partnerr

One more idea. Most sciences have a
“method of procedure.” A scientific date
would use as its method discussion, :3. sensi»
ble exchange of ideas on subjects ranging
from family ideals to the war—not a "line"
or l'cpartee, but sensible, well-founded dis»
cussron.

If you doubt that the exploration of
others’ interests, opinions, and knowledge is
the most lasting and pleasurable type of en-
joyment, try (liscussioneperhaps of scienti»
fic datingﬁon your next date, There are a
lot of good points not even mentioned yet.
Don’t expect to be perfect at first, of course.

And if you fear scientific dating will de—
stroy the home and the family, remember
that going steady and being engaged are
different things. You might discuss that,
