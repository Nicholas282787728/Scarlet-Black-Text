 

Betty Montague Elected .
Student Council Prexy

Climaxing two weeks of Vigorous politics,

Betty Mon-

tague, Reed junior, was elected president of the Student
Council for the year 1945—46,

For the third time in nearly'
one hundred years of Grinnell his-
tory, the tradition of a male stu
dent council president was brok—
en when Miss Montague became
the third successive woman to
lead Grinneil student government.

The final balloting by the stu»
dent body was held Monday at»
ternoon. That evening at dinr
oer Gerry Ross announced Miss
Montague the winner over the
other nominee, Gerry Warren.

Montague's Platform

Both Miss Montague and Miss
Warren spoke to the studentl
body at large on Monday morning
at 9 o'clock, Both' candidates
asked that the student body sup-
port wholeheartedly the winning
candidate. The platform which
Miss Montague advocated is, in
brief, as follows:

(1) More centralized social
activities. A committee inde-
pendent of the student council
would be formed.

(2) Better concentrated war
activities program,

(3) Preparation now for the
return of veterans to college next
fall, Evolve a “back to normal-
Cy" program.

(4) Plan for
fennial in 1946.

(5) Continued cooperation with
the faculty.

(6) continued support of the
honor system.

From the above platform Miss
Montague will plan her adminis-
tration for the next year.

Nominating Convention

The nominating convention on
Saturday was one of the most
dramatic of all conventions. Six
candidates withdrew before the
convention came to order. Speechr
es nominating the five remaining
candidates were given during the
first hour and were followed by
the first ballot, >

First Ballot

Indicating the popular vote of
the college, the first ballot found
Gerry Warren in the lead with
32 votes, Betty Montague second
with 23 votes, Jessie Tcrnberg
third with 13 votes, Mary caskey
fourth with 9 votes, and Virginia
Johnston last with 8 votes.

Although Gerry Warren receiv-
ed over thirty votes (the requir-
ed number for nomination),-the
rules states that two persons

Grinneil’s cenr

 

must receive 35 per cent of the:

total number of votes cast (this
year 30 votes) on any single
ballot. Since these conditions
were not met, a second ballot
was cast.

During the first intermission,
while campaign workers
busily trying to “highrpl'essur ,,
the delegates into voting for their
candidate, a colored band for
Ternberg gave a little concert.

Second Ballot

Gerry Warren's lead dropped
to 26 votes on the second ballot,
but she still remained in the
lead. It looked like the “dark
horse" of the convention was go»
ing to be Virginia Johnston, as
unpredictable Main hall dele-
gates swung their delegation to
Johnston and put her in second
place with 17 votes. Ternberg
remained in third place with 15
votes. The other half of the
Main delegation shifted to Caskey
and put her close on the heels
of Ternberg With 14 votes; Mon-
tague, losing a total of ten votes,
dropped to the bottom of the list
with a score of only 13.

Since no two candidates» had
yet received 30 votes apiece on
the same ballot, Gerry Ross
rapped the gavel for a third bal-
lot.

Third Ballot

The third ballot found Gerry
Warren still in the lead with 30
votes. Montague, regaining her
support from Main in almost
two-fold measure, was in second
place with 19 votes. Ternberg,
steadily climbing, was still in
third placc with 16 votes, Johns
ston was fourth with 11 votes,
and Caskey, losing her Main hall
support, dropped into last place
with 9 votes.

Caskey Withdraws

The air was tense with ex-
citement. Something had m
break. No two candidates had
yet received so votes apiece on
the same ballot, so a fourth bal-
lot was called. Upon calling the
convontion to order, Gerry Ross
read a note from Mary Caskey,
expressing her desire to witllr
draw from the convention in fa-
vor of Betty Montague.

This announcement threw the
convention into an uproar. As

Belgian War Relief
Society Requests
Cloil'iing Donations

Announcement was made today of
a drive to collect clothing for
the people of liberated Belgium.
The request for this collection
was made by the Friends of Bel»
gium, a committee of the Belgian
War Relief society.

In a letter received by the War
Service Council, Mme. Betty Bur—
zin, who spoke on the campus’
last year, said, “I need scarcely
tell you how important it is for
us to gather as much warm
clothing as possible; not only
have the Germans taken away
every decent piece of wool in
the country, but in addition there
are thousands of bombed out
families (venombed), and thousA
ands of refugees from the re-
cent battleground in the Southern
Bulge. All these people. men,
women, and children, are deprived
of everything wearable, and the
situation is becoming every day
more critical.”

It has been suggsetcd that stu-
dents might send home for cloth—
ing that they might wish to
contribute, and those going home
week ends might bring such‘
clothing back. A central collec-
tion place will be announced next
week, This will allow some time
for the students to obtain ar-
ticles for the drive, ‘
