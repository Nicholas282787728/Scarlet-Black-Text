Dr. Alexander Defends Capilalisﬁc Economy

Lecturer Claims
Lack of Success
Is Individual Fault

To be successful in our economic
system of capitalism, one must he
an expert in his or her field de<
clared Dr. Ruth Alexander, lec»
turing exponent of capitalism.

Dr. Alexander spoke before an
audience of students, faculty
members. and townspeople as the
first lecturer on the current col-
lege concert and lecture series,
last night in the high school aud-
itorium.

Anyone may he an expert in his
chosen field )f he will but follow
two fundamental rules, she stated,
First he must learn how to con-

centrate, bending every effort
toward achievement of the goal at
hand. Second, he must choose a
field suited to his natural mental
equipment.

nolds Audience.

Dressed in a formal evening
gown, Dr, Alexander, at times
held her audience's rapt attention;
and at times the listeners seemed
to feel that she was speaking in
platitudes, digresslng to widely
from her subject, trying too hard.

She seemed to be accustomed
to men eager to accept her point
of view without questions. She
met a typically critical college
audience last evening in Crinnell,
Extreme capitalist.

Her extreme capitalistic econ~
omy point of view found an out-

let throughout her speech.
“Wc're at the crossroads," she
Said. ‘

“We have the choice of contin-
uing with our economic system
which has proved so highly suc<
cessfulnin supplying wants and
needs of all men—or of reverting
to the tribal ideal in which each
men assumes the responsibility for
himselt alone.”

Lacks Ability.

“The unsuccessful man is unsuc—
cessful because of his own lack
of ability, she claimed. and not
because of a fault in the capital—
itic system.

“We want an economic society
of the strong, not the weak," the
lecturer declared.

year’s speaker for the annual his-

In comparing Grinnell with the
other schools at which he has
lectured. he stated that there is
one respect in which Grinnell dif-
fers from the rest.

“Grinnell is the only college in
which the students have taken
the initiative in inviting me to
join them in various social doe

He declared that the willing-

Blames Higher
Maintenance.

Food Cosl's

Increase in food costs and
maintenance expense were
named today by Pres. Samuel
N. Stevens to be the most
important reason for the $50 in-
crease in next year’s all-inclusive
fee.

Already, he stated, the food
and maintenance expenses for ads
year are beyond the budget fig-
ures.

“We do not believe that
the college Should offer
food, shelter, and service
of a non~educati0nal char-
acter at a loss,” Steven’s
said, “and it is reasonable

to expect that students
should pay in full for these
basic necessities.”

Ten dollars of the increase Will.
go to the linen tee. the president
noted. This fee Will pay for the
linen and laundry service, and
also for towels which will be
furnished by the College next
year,

“It is definitely not so," he
emphasized, "that other few In
the couege will be increased next
year. There wiu ho no further
changes in the costs or living and
studying at Grinneu than those
the Board has authorized at its
recent meeting."

The total financial picture will
be: $5 matriculation fee for new
students: $10 room deposit for
all students living in the quad-

Article on Grant 0. Gales’ Stroboscope, Adaptable to
Any Alternating Current, Printed in

Professor Now
Busy With Joule—

Thomsen Effect
By Catherine Funk

From the Pontiac chassis in the
hall to the airplane motor up-
stairs, Cooduow hall, housing
Grillllell's department of physics,
is a busy place this year.

Research and advanced study,
in addition to regular class work,
are being carried on under the di-
rection of Grant 0. Gale, associate
professor of physics.

Newest addition to the hand—
made equipment of the laboratory
is a stroboscope, the instrument

which makes possible the “action
shots" of bullets being fired, glass
breaking, and baseballs ‘curving.’

Measuring the speed of moving
objects by an almost instantan-
eous flash of a neon light. the
stroboscopc, paced to a disc rc-
volving 1300 times a minute,
makcs the disc appcar stationary.

According to Cale, the disc is
seen only when the light ﬂashes
on it. With the flash and the rev-
olutions timed to coincide, the disc
is seen in the same position with
each flash, and appears not to
move at all.

“In making the recentlyvpubli-
cized action shots? Gale said, “a
special stroboscopic camera is
used, A series of pictures is tak-

en, each shot corresponding to the
dash of light in a laboratory
stroboscope. The composite of all
the pictures shows, for instance,
a bullet leaving a gun and travel—
ling to the target,"

Unique feature of Gale's stro—
boscope is its adaptability to any
alternating current, such as the
60 cycle power supply, or the out
put of an amplifier. This innova—
tion was described in the Anne
can Journal of Physics in Decem—
ber, 1939, after Cale had demo -
strated his instrument at a Uni-
versity of Iowa symposium of
college physics teachers.
