Men On I'lonor
Football Team

Jacobs, Sory. Owen,
Hart. Fort Included
On All-Star Roster

By Sterling Lord.

All six halls placed men on
the Scarlet and Black’s alle
star men's intramural foot—
ball team, with Gates hall,
league champions, rating five
places on the selections.

Four of the 17 players on the
two teams were Dibble men. three
were from Langan, two each from
Rawson and Smith and one from
Clark.

.Players' Caliber Shown.

The caliber of play among the
'ends. centers and backs was es-
pecially high in the league games.
Judges had to name four backs
on the second team because of
the wealth of material. Even then
such capable performers as Dick
Knowlton of Dibble, Gene Wulfing
of Gates, and Fred Schaefer of
Rawson were not named in selec-
tions.

Don Jacobs of Dibble and Evel'v
ett Sory of Gates, first team end
selections, were probably the two
highest scoring ends in the
league. Jacobs was an oiitstand~
ing defensive end, while Sory
played in the backfield on de-
fense. These two were picked
ahead of Ed Bailey of Smith, a
standout on a weaker teem.
Tackle Posts Given.

The tackle posts went to Bill
Owen of Gates and George Mor-
ton of Longer, a pair of rugged,
hardechal'ging offensive linemen.
Owen was selected as the num—
her one tackle in the league.

Two players were outstanding
at the center position during the
season: Walt Robiiliard. Rawson,
and Dick Fort, Dibble, lint Robe
illiard was given the nod in the
final selection. Fort played havoc
with opposing ball carriers as a
defensive end.

Anestai- Backlield Named.

The all-star backfield is probabr
ly as fast as any that could be
picked from the halls, yet ‘all
three of the players are strong
iii other departments of play.
Jerry Fort, Dibble’s triple-threat~
er. was an easy choice for the
number one backfield spot. His
teammates are Ralph Hart of
Gates and Tommy Bachrach of
Rawson. These three outranked
Walt Morris, Gates' outstanding
lilocking back, and Jim Norton,
