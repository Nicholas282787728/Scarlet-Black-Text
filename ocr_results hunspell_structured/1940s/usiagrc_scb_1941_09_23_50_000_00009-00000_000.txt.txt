Crinnell To Face Lawrence In Grid Opener

Pioneer Squad Concludes
Heavy Prac‘lice Sessions

For Game Wi’rh Vikings

After approximately two weeks of strenuous practice, the
1941 edition oi" the Grinnell Pioneer football team is mould»
ing into shape. Coming- bdck to the campus September 10,
the Gllnnell griddels, led by Coaches Bell Douglas and Marty
0Connol, and Capt Louie Golliils, indulged in twice- a- day
practices until today when the wolkouts wele leduced to
one ——
In the opening game next Sal:—
urday afternoon, Coach Douglas
will rely mostly on last year's
veterans to carry the burden
with an untried sophomore filling
in here and there.
Johnny Law,

Reese, also sophomores, and
Lowell Gausc, end on the squad
two years ago, at thc signal callr
ing post.

The job to uncover a replacee
merit for Fred Webb. last year’s
southpaw passcr, is nearing an
end as Don Hippie shows promise
of developing into a competent
chuckcr. With Hlpple in one
halfback position, the other back
position should fall to Augie

hard blocking
back from last year's squad,
seems to have the nod at the
signal calling post with Murray
Richards, sophomore, c o min g
along fast. In addition to these
two men, Douglas has been tr Gruening or Don Hock, reserves
ing Harold Jekel and Virgil from last ycar. Hock was injured

AROUND THE CONFERENCE: Three new coaches “in oppcor in
the Midwest conference this fall, Glenn Robinson at Monmouth, Walt
Koch at Cornell, and Louie Means at Boloit . . . Odds on favorites to
take the Midwest title this year, according to reports from Wisconsin,
are Belolt and Ripon l i . Also the reports say that Lawrence is the
dark horse , . , Radio announcers and linotype operators are going to
have a nightmare this year with such names as Sclissi of Ripon; and
Schuelzky of Goo . i i There has not been an undefeated champion
since the Lawrence team of 1933 and evidence points to none this
year also . The Coe college Kohawks. by faculty decree, must
henceforth practice on the game field in front of the gym. The team
was getting in the way of the co-ed sports program on the practice
field.

INTRAMURAL ITEMS: Last year 244 men out of 374 participated in
some form of intramurals, which is 65 percent . , . Dibble with 78
per cent; Gates with 57 percent; and Clark with 63 percent led the
dorms , l . Langan seems to be the dark horse in the coming intra-
mural race.

THINGS I NEVER KNEW Tn. NOW. That one reason for changing
the name of Iowa College to Grinncll College was that in the write-
ups of the sporting events back at the turn of the century, it was
confusing to read about Iowa University at Iowa City, Iowa state at
Ames, Upper Iowa, Iowa Wesleyan, and Iowa college at Grinnell, so
the trustees, in order to avoid the confusion, changed the name to
Grinnoll college. That the Maltese Cross now associated with
Grinnell College was first thought up by the athletic department and
worn by the track team for many seasons.

Prep Fooiball
Sui’rs +0 Be Issued
Tomorrow a’r 3:30

All freshmen who have played
football in high school, or who
are interested in playing in col-
lege are askcd to rcport at the
gymnasium Wednesday afternoon

be issued, freshman mentor G,
Lester Duke said today The
first practice for the preps will

Carl Blandin of Grinnell, last
year's varsity fullback, has vol-
unteered to help coach the props.
He is waiting to be called into

be here most of the football sea—
son, Duke said.

in pro-season practice, but should
he in trim for Saturday's game.

For fiillbacks or the tailbacks
as they are callctl in the Douglas
system, Grinncll has Robert
Hamann, lcttcr—winiicr from two
years ago, Ed Nagcl, untried
sophomore, and Tom Gannody,
lotter ~inncr last year. Haniann
is on exceptional punter, Whose
cducatcd too should aid the
Pioneers greatly

The one weak spot in the scar—
lct and black line is the tackle
posts. To liclp plug up this hole,
Lille Coach O'Connor has shifted
Jcrry Grant from end to tackle.
To date, Grant. who tips the
beam close to 200 pounds, has
been hampered with an old knee
injury, Georgc Bishop, letter—
winner last year, will hold down
the right tackle spot, with Grant
and Joe Dykstra. junior, loading

the other candidates for tho left
tackle position. other gi-idders
vicing for tncklc positions are Ed
Mitchell, sophoinorc; Warren
Brown, scnior; and Reyn Norton,
sophomore.

At the guard posts, O'Connor
is banking heavily upon Ray
Mathews and Capt. Louic Gonias.
three year veterans, to carry
the burden. Clint Taylor and
Jack Bredimuo arc fighting ‘for
the guard po r ions. Johnny Mill-
er, who makes up for his small
stature by his scroppiness, is al»
so slated to see considerablc ac-
tion.

Possibly the most fortified
spots in the line are at me ends,
where four good players are a
toss up. Hugh McCartney and
Tod Kennefick, last year's veter-
ans, sccm to have the slight nod
over Ed sory and Harry Waters,

sophomores, because of their fine
defensive play in addition to their
pass catching ability. Sory and
Waters, who are slightly faster
than tlic veterans, will see plenty
of action ncxt Saturday.

Dean DcWitt and Art Werlcin,
lcttcr winners. are the loading
candidates for the center post,
but Edd Bowel-s is coming along
‘fast and is giving DcWitt and
VVerlein a push for the pivot
position.

According to Douglas. with the
new unlimited substitution rule
going into effectF‘this year it will
be possible to shift the team
around more, and captializc on
the special abilities of certain in—
dividuals. However, Grinnell. be-
cause of its size, will not use a
separate team for offense and de-
fense, as many teams around the
country are planning.
