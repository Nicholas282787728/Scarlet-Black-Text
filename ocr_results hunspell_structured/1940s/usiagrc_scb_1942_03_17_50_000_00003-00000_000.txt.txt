War Nerves Blamed—
China Supply

—Sul‘iering Heavily
By Kennelh Slanley

with an evident premonition of
tiie anrcoming international dis-
asters eventually involving the
Grinnell collegian, Grinnell wait-
ers and waitresses seemed to
have been suffering from a case
of premature war nerves.

As an outcome of this and var-
ious other shocks to their delicate
nervous systems, the kitchen
help seems to have been a bit
uncertain in their juggling of cer-
tain articles of essential equip—
ment The treasurers office now
finds it necessary to replenish
its supply of china to the tune of
$735, according to last year's
prices.

Everything from flared jam and
pickle dishes to custard cups have
been ordered to renew the dc-
pleted supply of china. The most
casualties seem to have been
listed among the water glasses,
but the supply is being renewed
by an order of 1200 of the non-
brealrable variety.

Second Program
Aired Yes’rerday

with the first notes of "Sons
of Old Grinnell” played by the
college band, the second radio
program was aired yesterday are
temoon at 4:05,

Following the band's first selec.
tion, Dr. Henry s. Conard, prof-
essor of botany, spoke on the va-
cation spots in laws.

He told of the many beautiful
state parks in Iowa, and said
that therefore it was not neces-
sary to travel great distances to
spend n enjoyable vacation.

After Dr. Conard had concludr
ed his talk, the band played two

more numbers. Francis Agar was
the announcer.

Thc previously quoted price is
as uncertain as the heavy thumb-
ed dorm waiter, for they are
based on 1941 prices, Due to
rising prices the china will cost
more than last year, and the ac-
tual sum will not be quoted until

_the time of delivery.

If worse ,comes to worse and
the world reverts back to the
primitive, this new china may
never be used. The primordial
prop will have to barbecue his
classmates, and eat with only his
natural equipment—that is, if he
is still able.

Fingerprinis Of
Flyers Taken

All the members of the Civilian
Pilot’s Training Program, have
been tingei-printed by a member
of the Federal Bureau of Investlr
gation, so that they will be per»
mitted to solo. when they have
completed the required number of
hours, according to Grant o,Gale
faculty supervisor.

“It will not be known whether
or not a secondary flying course
will be offered next semester unr
til an answer is received to aletr
ter sent to the Department of
Commerce in Kansas city," Gale
said.

May Expand
Swim Program

Here This Spring

Dud Conner, varsity swimmer,
has taken over Marty O'Comlor’s
swimming classes for the re»
maindcr of the year, according to
John C. Truesdale, Director of In-
traanurals.

In addition there is a possibil—
ity of expansion of the swimming
program in connection with con—
ditioning, Truesdale said. Later in
the spring a water safety pro—
gram may be added to the con—
ditioning program in order to
give men skill in safety for them-
selves and ror others and to teach
resuscitation.

Truiesdale said that this should
be especially valuable for men
who may have to make up land-
ing parties in the Army and
Marine Corps when they leave
college. The Japanese have been
particularly successful in their
landing attempts to date because
of their many expert swimmers.
