rain, honey
dreds of Grinnellians trudged
through the mud to Merrill parkl

of fried chicken and potato salad‘
and to watch the studentrfaculty
stunts that make Spring day a
Grinneli tradition.

Earlier in the day they heard
Frank Sanders, Student Council
president, announce hall assign-
ments for police and cleaneup
duty on the campus

The most important project
undertaken was the preliminary
work done on a cement walk
between the book store and ARH.

After a lunch ably served by
members of the faculty, the rain-
coated crowds watched Smith
hall's mighty men of the hemp‘
pull Clark’s team heddlongl
through the muck and slime in

most before it began.
An egg throwing contest be-

tween G. Lester Duke, Donald

M, Brieland, Norman Goodbrod,
and “Bunny" soaks: ended dis-
astrously for all four. It is rum-
ored that Claire's cleaners lice
nated the eggs.

In the final event of the day
a hardy handful of spectators
was rewarded by seven fast in-
nings of softball between teams
representing faculty and male
members of the Student Council
and the Council of House Presl-
dents.

sparked by the heavy hitting
of Dallas “King Kong” Young
and "Jolting" Charlie Haner. the

faculty dropped a close 5-2 lie-y

cision to the younger men.
Hero of the afternoon for the
faculty was Neal “Dizzy” Klaus

lner who fanned three men and
a tugeof-war that was over al- announced after the game that“
