GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

2
Drink, Drank, Drunk...Unlimited?

This week the S & B is once more graced by a samp-
ling of the eloquent prose of the shorter member of the
inimitable team of Geselscllap and Jelinek. We have, durv
ing the last few weeks, been on the receiving end of com-
ments of almost every color on the subject of their epistol-
airy debate and feel that editorial comment is finally in 012

er.

So far, we have been able to glean at least one basic
fact from the apparently endless verbiage of this stout
hearted pair, and that is that a very definite problem exists
concerning the functioning and essence of the campus
drinking regulations now in effect. And this problem must
of necessity be thought out not only in the light of the
violent sentiments of Messrs, G and J (which we find have
more than a little common sense), ‘but also with the pri-
mary thought in mind, “How will any changes effect me
as a citizen of the Grinnell college community?"

But what do we have in our duel of letters other than
witticism and a problem stated? From-Ml: G we have an
expression this week of a final solution of no little merit.
He is flatly saying (according to our interpl-etatlon)_ that
League or Baffle Board be relegated to a position of Judge
and jury over accused rule violations. The present policmg
functions of both boards, says Al, should be totally absorb-
ed by the students themselves, with their word and that of
the “jury” being the final one. This seems to us to be a
mature, sensibleiyea, even democratic-approach to our
problem. _ ‘

From Mr. J We get another factor which is necessary
to our considerations. Dave has said in the past—and With
good reason;that the student body cannot be_ regarded as
the sole residuary of responsibility. He reminds us that
there are necessary elements (“friends alumni and pat—
rons of the college”) that cannot be overlooked 1 our reas-
oning. ‘

Honor, dut , and reputation may be tr_ e words but
they form an in vitable triangle that must he at the base
of any institutional structure. This triangle must be held
firmly in mind as we attempt a solution to the problem of
the drinking regulations at Gimnell.

Now it just happens, undoubted-

words left to say on the sub-

But first, a word for Dave,
Last week he criticized my “un-

do congratulate him on his ob—
