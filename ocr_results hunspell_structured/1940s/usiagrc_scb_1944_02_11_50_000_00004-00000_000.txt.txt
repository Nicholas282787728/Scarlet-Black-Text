Speaking of a dance, and since

have heard a rumor concerning
Kay Van Tright. How about it,
John?

The Basic ones are doing pretty
well over in the quad according to
reports. Bill Dietrich has been
seen quite often with Marjorie

any optimism as to the college’s.

Give Madole
Firs’r Defeat

By Bill Fox

"Plide goeth before a tall", and
there was plenty ot pride and
plenty of falling last night as
livanski's surprising quintet
trounced the hitherto unbeaten
[Madole outfit. The score was 20
to 14 and the game was just like
the score. Slow, cautious passes,l
and a steady, working offense
marked both teams. Fast breaks
were the exception although Ma-
dole was almost beaten by them
last week.

A beautiful defensive joE .v s
lhanded in by Iwallski's forward .
Their speed and cagry ‘know-
how‘ stopped many a scoring

way. Madole's team, outstanding
for their poise and beautiful
passes as well as their smooth
sldeangle push shots, never
seemed to get going. Their shoot-,
mg was ragged and erratic anal
many of their passes were inter
cepted by an alert defense,
Iwanski headed the offensive
fireworks. H|S beautiful pusll
shot down the center was woilc
ing to perfection, and his teams
victory was essentially due to his
scoring. ,

All in all it was a Case at
good team losing to a better
team. Some observers were in-
