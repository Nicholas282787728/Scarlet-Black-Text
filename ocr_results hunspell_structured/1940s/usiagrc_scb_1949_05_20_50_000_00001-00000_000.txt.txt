WAA Plans Name
Change, Schedules
Program For Fall ,

At a special meeting of the
WAA Tuesday evening, it was
suggested that the name of the
organization he changed to We—
men’s Recreation Association.
The membership would then in-
clude all members of athletic
clubs in addition to those _wo—
men‘who qualify for member
ship by participating in intra—
murals.

The suggestion resulted from
a conference of the Athletic
Federation of College Women
held recently at Madison, Wise.
A delegation of WAA members
from Gtinnell attended.

Plans for next year's activ—
ities were discussed at the meet-
ing. Crew hats will be purchas-

- ed for all members of WAA. A
handbook explaining the organ<
ization will be printed and
given to all new students. A
publicity chairman will be add-
ed to the board of the associa-
tion.

O’Leary will benefit, fifteen
years or so hence, from the love
his father felt for Grinnell.

His father, LeRoy O’Leary, a
Marine veteran of five years
service, come to Grinnell in the
fall of 1947. He was elected
president of the freshman class,
and was awarded a numeral as
a member of the freshman
track team. Active in intramural
sports. he was well—liked by the
members of Cowles hall, with
which he was affiliated.

Though he knew he would
soon die of cancer, O’Leary came
back to Grinnell in 1948 to spend
his last months here. He died
in February, leaving Michael
alone with his mother.

To show their regard for
O'Leary, the men of Cowles hall
are now setting up a trust fund
which will be applied to
Michael's expenses when he
matriculates at Grinnell, Some-
time around 1953, or at any
other college he chooses. ,

it ,is hoped by half members
that Michael and his mother
will be able to come to Grinnell
before commencement, so that
he can be made a member of
the hall and receive a copy of
the trust fund agreement.

The fund, set up with a local
bank, will have as its trustees
four members of Cowles and
bank officers, Acting as charter
trustees are William O‘Brien,
junior, Henry Moi, junior, Wile
liam Olson, sophomore, and
William Richardson, sophomore,
all of Cowles. Each year for the
next ten years a hall commit-
tee for fund-raising will be ap<
pointed. '

you that the ultimate end of
your recent scrutinization of

elect a candidate.
