Tod Kennefick in
Slar’ring Lineup

Last night‘s signal drill and
review of Parsons plays top-
ped the week's practice for
the Pioneer football squad as
overcon‘fidcnce and injury con-
fidence and injury continued to be
the main obstacles in the way of
a Grinnell victory tonight,

The overconfirence is believed
caused by the fact that although
Parsons has a team good enough
to run up more yards against St.
Ambrose than did Drake, it rep
resents the Iowa conference,
which is rated lower than the
Midwest.

Injuries Hamper Squad

Ben Douglas big headache this
week is the injuries of Ed Nagel
and Ted Kennefick. Nagei has not
yet recovered from the head in-
jury he received last week, and
Kennefick still has a bad chariey
horse from the Knox game. It is
doubtful that either will dress for
the game tonight.

Brightening the outlook for the
coaches is the retum of Harold
Jckel and Lefty Soryi Both were
bothered by chariey horses Iole
lowing the Knox game, but they
are expected to see action tonight.

Parsons runs most of its plays
from the T formation, shifting
sometimes to the single wing.
The spark-plug of the team is
fullback Wayne Harrel; one of
their fastest men is quarterback
Floyd “Puffy" Pugh of Grimelli
starting Linevup Lister]

The starting line-up for die
Pioneers will include Harry
Waters, who tumed in a top
notch performance against Knox,
replacing the injured Kennefick,
The rest of the starting line will
probably remain the same as last

the rumor running wild about

Tigers at 15 rocks per head .

someone who had been pipe-
