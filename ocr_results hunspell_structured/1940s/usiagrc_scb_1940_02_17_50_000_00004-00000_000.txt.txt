Sorta looks like the Pioneels cut
their chances for Lhe conference
championship pretty thin last
night, when they lost to BeIolL.
We thought they would be a cinch
to take a, team standing at fifth

pop up every now and then. Of
course, Lawrence might knock
over Ripon Monday night . . .

Three of last “eek’s games were
decided by a margin of one basket
or loss. Carleton dropped a 39 to
37 scramble to Grinnell but took
a 38 to 37 victory from Coe the
following night. Ripon shaded
Knox by a single basket. . .

Let’s give Hap Kendall and Fred

for the way they've been plugging
up the holes in the Pioneer den
fense the past few games . . .
