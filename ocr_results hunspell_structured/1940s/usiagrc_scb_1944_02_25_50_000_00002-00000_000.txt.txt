On Grinnell' 5 S+a+us - -

Tuo yearrs ago we uele facing with anxiety
the fact that G1innell would very likely be
asked to undertake the housing and t1" ln
ing‘ of mili-
tary person
nel, We won»
dereddlow it
would affect
our way of
life, what
kind of ad»
justments we
would have
to make, and
whether the
things that
we held most
dear ill the
College would
remain.

The Offi-
cer Candidate
School came,
and we found
that it was a distinct asset. It added a
fine milital; touch, contributed effectively
to the enrichment of our social life, and a
few girls found husbands.
convenience was occasioned by the loss of
some classroom facilities,
‘ Last year we discovered ill the early
spring that the 008 would be discontinued.
Again we were very much upset and rumors
ran wild. Then during the sumnler, the
Government contracted with the College
for the activation of a STAR unit and
certain AST units. We have had a wonder,
i’ul year. The boys have been happy in
their wOl {, they have contributed definitely
to the enrichment of our life, and everyone
has gained something good out of the ex»
perlence. Our academic pl‘ogr‘nl has been
maintained with only a fen minor restric1
tiolls, and nothig that was important to
our way of life has been lost..

Now we face a new adjustment. We
were told several weeks ago that the STAR
unit would be disbanded ill May, and that
the Language and Area contract would
not be renewed ill June, Last Friday the
Secretary of War issued a general order
which returned 2111 of the ASl‘ soldiels to
the troops with the e\ception of those ill
advanced medical, dental and ennineering
twining Out of appro llnately 11.18 000 Eur
lollees b,110 000 u 1 be lcassiglled to active
set-,vice This decision came as a surprise
to everyone and it must have been made
on the basis of info1mation llot genemlly

The greatest in- ,

 

available to the public. The interesting thing
about the order is that it does not elimin-
ate the ‘AST program, for the service come
manders were instructed to keep contracts
intact, This would indicate that some fur-
ther use lvill be made of the college now
in the AST structure, and we may 11 ason-
ably assume that at a proper time military
education will again be the order of the
day on the Grinnell campus.

Since this program is uncertain many
students are wol d for fear that the elimi-
nation of all military education will have
serious effects on the kind of educational
proglam available next year. While this is
a p maly conccln of the students and one
fol which they are to be complimented, othel
young women have expressed dissatisfaction
with the prospect of being without male comv
panions while ill College. This is what war
does to us. It makes us anxious and uneasy.
It frequently causes us to lose our perspecr
tive, and it is almost inevitable that impul—
sive judgments will be made which are not
supported by the facts. What will be the
effect of the temporary or permanent dis-
continuance of AST at Grillllell on the edu-
cational program for 1944-45? The answer
is that our curriculum and our faculty will
actually be enriched rather than weakened
by this enforced adjustment. We shall have
more full time members of the faculty availr
able for instruction. We shall offer more
courses ill the upper divisions than we have
offered this year.

Because members of the faculty will not
have to devote their time to the a1my to the
extent which n as necessmy this year we
shall have the expelience of closer fellow-
ship between faculty and students than has
heretofore been possible If the Government
slloul dinstruct us to ulldeltake education of
militaly pelsonncl latel ill the yeal, we shall
do so and shall t1y to make the lien e\pc
encc as satisfying and enriching as out ler
ones have been.

The administration of the College has been
anticipating such eventualities as have oc-
curred. We are not caught “flat footed” so
to speak. Our plans for the coming year
are already far advanced. That is part of
our job. Had we dolle less than this, stur
dents, alumni and faculty would have been
justified ill criticizing us

Necessaly steps ale being taken to p19
serve for the student body next year the
younger mombels of the faculty who ale un-
dcl Selective Selvicc. We are encoulaged
to believe by such men as General Hershey
that it is not in the national interest so to
strip a faculty of its competent younger men
as to leave the college unable to maintain
sound programs of high quality.

Our field counselors bring in most encoure
aging reports as to the outlook for fresh
mall students next year. We should have
at least 400 students ill our civilian student
body in September. We may have a larger
number than this

The concern of students for what will hap1
pen next year is tholoughly undelstandable,
but they are not taking- maximum advantage
ol the oppoltullities which ale available to
them now. The better part of wisdom would
be to make this current year as significant as
possible, and to have faith in the College and
its administration that in the year ahead all
the rallies that you seek in your educational
experience will be found here.

We arc having a good year. Believe me
whell I say that next year will be better,
