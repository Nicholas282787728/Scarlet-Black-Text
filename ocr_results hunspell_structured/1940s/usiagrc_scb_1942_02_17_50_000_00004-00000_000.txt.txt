Losing S’rreak
Hi’rs Three Losses

With their losing streak at a
new high of three straight, the
freshman basketball team will be
seeking revenge against Marshall-
town junior college here Saturday
night.

In their game last weekend
against the Coe preps, the year-
ling Pioneers lost 45 to 37 after
leading at the half 23_to 21.

Early in the second period the
fircwagon offense of the Kohawks
began to click. and their fast
break caught the Pioneers flat—
footed time and time again. In
the last few moments of the game,
the Grinnell preps started hitting
their shots again and pulled
within eight points of the win-
ners.

Tex Kaufmann led the Grinnell
scorers with 19 points. A1 Nichols
and Brumie Vanstrum turned in
the outstanding ﬂoor games of the
evening. Gregor‘s 14 points top-
