Snow, Carls
S’rop Pioneers

A surprisingly large group of‘
Grinncll enthusiasts, who didn’t
mind waiting while a Carleton
ground crew shoveled about an
inch and a half of snow off the
field in a pro-game scene stealer,
were treated to one of the out-
standing plays of the season as
the Pioneer's bowed to the Carls
18713 at Nortlifield last weekend.

Left end Mel White staged the
play of the game in the fourth
quarter by scooting into the
Carleton backfield as Rottke pl‘e-l
pared to punt. White scooped the
ball off Rottke‘s toe and raced
40 yards for a touchdown.

Apparently at home in the
midst of snowy gusts: the Carle-
ton eleven shoved to a 12-0 lead
by the end of the first half, hav-
ing scored on drives of 47 and 79
yards. ‘

The Pioneers returned to field‘
after hellﬁtinle better acclimated
and tallied in five plays. A 157
yard sprint by Bouma, and
Booth’s 20-yard run were topped
or: by the scoring pass from
Bouma to Herb White. Webb
booted the only successful cone
version of the afternoon.

The consistent‘ Carls marched
back 68 yards to score on a 47-
yard pass in the same quarter.
The teams stayed evenly matchr
ed forthe remainder of the game,
Grinnell’s final tally coming on
White's larceny in the fourth
quarter.

And as Crinnell moved into a
two-way tie for fourth lplace,
Lawrence dumped Beloit into the
same spot with a 37-0 trouncing'
that earmarks the Vikings for the
Mi rWest Conference’s top hone .‘

Wehrli‘s fourth Gates lecture
Pointing out that since the be-

torn between church and state, he
told his audience that “loyalty to

iOnly in this realization can a

The final lcctnre was concerned
with the ways in which religion
has, through the years, discov—
