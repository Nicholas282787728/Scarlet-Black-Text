“ Everyone Should Paint ”advises
Des Moines Water Color Artist

“Everyone should have a.
chance to paint, not with any
thought of becoming an artist,
but for the pure joy of express-
ing himself,” is the opinion of
William Bealmer, well-known
artist, whose water colors are
being shown in Main drawing
room this month.

Mr. Bealiner, assistant profes—
sor of art at Drake university,
believes that drawing and paint-
ing are the most universal art
forms, offering complete free ex-
pression, and that a non-credit
recreational painting course is a
valuable addition to any liberal
arts education.

"Recreational painting develops
tolerance and appreciation of
line and color, not only for art,
but for the everyday things
uztround us, and draws the paint-
ings we see closer to life. The
easiest way to understand is to
do," he stated.

To prospective commercial or
tists, Mr. Bealmer offers the ad-
vice that it ispreferable to sell
ten paintings at $10 each rather
than one at slooi “The only way
to get started," he said, “is to
paint and sell in quantity, in or-
der to make your name known
to the public."

The broad ,beekground offered
by a liberal arts education is es-
sential, according to Mr. Beal-
mer, because it gives the student
the broad knowledge of subject
matter and the ability to get on
well with his fellow men which
are the first prerequisites of a
true artist.

“Any art student should follow

liberal arts training wiui ad-
vanced work or apprenticeship in
the specific fold of art he has
chosen to enter.”

However, Mr. Beeliner does
not feel that a doctor's degree is
important unless the artist plans
to teach in a university. “Only n
few top artists live by painting
alone,” he said. “Most teach or

pursue another vocation in addi»
tioni"
