DANCING FOR ALL.

Most colleges are too expensive for the impccunious.
the "type” man of any liberal arts college is of the
handsome mediocrity, and vigorous and original thought
are rare exceptions in any institution and in all walks
of life.

These criticisms of Grinnell college on the part of
Ruth Suckow seem to be criticisms of life in general as
well of the part of it in which we live—Crinnell. The

proposed compulsory dance fee wouldn't make these
criticisms any more true 011 the other hand might not
the fact that our conventional form of entertainment.
dancing, was greatly reduced in cost increase the amount
of money that would be free for other and more original
forms of entertainment. A sizable portion of Crinnell's
population attend dances now, and the dance fee would
be for them a considerable saving. This saving can be
realized by comparing the dance fee of two dollars to
the cost of the nine average varsities of nine dollars.
To the portion of Grinnell's student body which does not
now attend dances the two dollars would bring a rich
return for the money. The law of diminishing utility
here operatesithose who enjoy relatively few dances
perhaps appreciate each opportunity for dancing the
more.

It has been demonstrated in the past that the wel-
fare of the group as a whole is advanced as that group
becomes 'more able to share all things equally. Would
not the “standard of living" here at Crinnell he raised
by making it possible for every one to enjoy the social
pleasures the college now affords for some students?

The dance fee would for some make available more
money with which to enjoy original forms of recreation
without curtailing the amount of conventional dancing
available. while for others the low cost of the fee would
make it possible for them to acquire new experience and
enjoyment at a price compatible with the size of their
pocket-books. A. E. T.

EXAMS VERSUS STUDY.

There are two reasons ordinarily given for the ex-
istence of the semester examinations which are again
to the fore on all American campuses. They help the
professors in grading and they cause the students to
review the year's work. The ﬁrst reason given is prob»
ably correct, but unless the second can also be proved,
it hardly justiﬁes devoting an entire week at the end of
each semester to examinations. The purpose of a col-
lege education, after all is the obtaining of ideas and
useful information, not the making of grades.

studying for examinations could be called revleWA
ing, but the student term, cramming, is much more ac-
curate. No one seriously believes that students, as a
result of this studying, will retain in after year's know-
ledge which would otherwise have escaped their mama
cries. The typical, and indeed necessary, method of
cramming under the present system precludes this pos—
sibility. How can the student who spends an evening
memorizing dates in history and the names of the var-
ious parts of an earthworm‘s anatomy, writes out this
information the next day, and then looks up the central
theme of “Intimatlons of Immortality from Recollec-
tions of Early Childhood” and the form of the Spenserian
stanza for the following morning, expect to have learn-
ed anything about history, biology, or English litera-
ture? The fact that the average student takes six ex-
aminations instead of the three used for examples does
not help him to remember any of the jumble of facts he
hurriedly memorizes. Any of these facts which he re-
members after two weeks of vacation he probably knew
before the examination. 5. J.

Waiter Straley, George van Nos—

Sheed, Robert Blasier and Harold
Horn. All of these speakers did e
cellent work, and their rankings
were very close to those of the win-

contest is presented in the fact that
seven of the nine speakers re»
ccived one first place. There were
only seven judges; if there had been
nine probably all of the nine speaks
ers would have received a first. None

ants got more than one second place,
Such results are very unusual. The
final rankings were also close. Allen

Grinnell Will Play
Dra‘ke in Baseball

Griunell college will again sponsor
varsity baseball this season, but not
as a major spor-t. Coach .7. C. Trues-
dale has announced that a team will
be chosen from the men who have
been showing up well in intram-
ural play, and two games are to be
played with the Drake nine. The
games are scheduled for Friday and
Saturday, May 30 and 31.

The Drake nine has been operat»
ing as a unit throughout the season
and boasts several experienced play~
ers including Lynn King, sensational
football and basketball star. The
teams played two games last year,
the Bulldogs winning at Des Moines
but losing here.

Large Percentage
of Seniors Pledge

Pledges for the 1930 Class Fund
have already been turned in from
forty—one of the ﬁfty-six men in the
class, and fifty-ﬁve of the seventy
girls, bringing the total up to about
eighty per cent. Canvasser‘s are still
at work hoping to secure pledges
from the ﬁfteen men and ﬁfteen wo-
men who so far are unpledged, so
that 193p may offer President Main
a 100 per cent gift at commence-
ment.

Those in charge of the fund among
the men are Davis Greene, chairman,
Ed Allen, Russell Smith, Douglas
Hayes, Merton Knapp, Al Johnson.
Her-old Rose, Car-roll Dewey, Russell
Peterson, Charles Parish, and Don
Rutherford. At the quad Katherine
Gillespie is chairman, and her can-
vassers are Arline Urban, Eva
Adams, Vivian Fansher, Blanche
Hulsebus,
Rathman, Geraldine Brinkman, Jane
Clapp. Margaret Atkinson, Marjory
Wilder, and Miriam McNally, while
Margaret Matlack and Wilma Cal—

lagher have worked among the town‘

girls.
