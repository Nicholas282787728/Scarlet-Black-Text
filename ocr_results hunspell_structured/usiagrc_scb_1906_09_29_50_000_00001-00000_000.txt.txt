Over two years ago the Dramatic
Club of Iowa. College held its last‘
meeting. The Spilit which lladl
prompted the formation or such oi‘
club some live years previous seemed
[or various reasons to have been CIOWd'

of the College and the movement was
allowed to die. Whateverthe reasons
that caused (his untimely demise. by
it the institution lost a. valuable bit
or student activity whose place notir
ing else Within reach could (ill.

The Dramatic Club originally grew
out Ola. leading club composed of a
law men noon. the college classes who
devotedalitrlc time to the reading
in an informal way of contemporary
eons filamutic literature. Soon a
more permanent organization was
[mined byia group which included
some of these men and also some
women students. ‘he idea. was simply
to get acquainted with those plays
which were zit tlieiime in prominence
but wliosc stage presentation was
inaccessible, the motive ibeing a pure-
ly pleasurable one u 1 not pursued
with any special liie iiical
intention , When that idea wits los‘ii

minds or those most interested ii hope
