The Russians Came

The campus was invaded by
three Russians from the Sov-
iet Youth Exhibition this past
week. German Orlov, Yuri Rag-
ulyov, and Mars Zabirov had a
full schedule during their three
thys on campus; attending clas-
ses, including all Russian lan-
guage classes. giving two lecv
tures. attending a party and cof-
fee hour at Russian House, and
attending dinner in Quad Dining
Hall with Russian students.

They said that they found the
Grinnell students to be friend-
ly, wellrintormed, courteous and
Curious about the Soviet Union.
They were impressed with the
{Outtlryear Russian students‘t‘l-
uency in the Russian language.
SAGA tood also impressed them.
Ragulyov snated, "Students here
seem to know much more about
the Soviet Union than students
we've managed to meet before
in Kansas City and other plac-
es. This is the first time we've
met with sudi interest about
Soviet Union problems and we're
doing our best to explain what's
going on in our country."

_Orlov found Iowa peaceful in
comparison to‘such places as
Kansas City. "It reminds me of
the Ukraine but with better his
ghways." he said of the area.
In various Classes and in their
lecture-discussions, they cov-
ered everything from the
U.S.S.R.'s educational system
with its specializationoriented
universities to what best sellers
the Soviets are reading in the
Soviet Union.

logical end of the writer because
it's what he'd been striving for
for so long. This was nota de-
cision of some ofﬁcials but a
decision endorsed by the whole
population. A writer or citizen
tannot be regarded as such if
he hates the population of the
country and the country itself; its
way of life." He added that "an
avalanche of letters went to the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R."
and that the author's last novel,
was "the last drop in the bucket
and let out the indignation of Lhe
population of the U.S.S.R." He
said that it is hard fortheSoviets
to understand Solzhenitsyn's view
of fascism. "It‘s notwhiteswasht
ed fascism, but he actually went
out in support or it. He actually
tried to justify their actions."
