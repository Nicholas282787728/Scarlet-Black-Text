The exhibit was organized by

pieces in this exhibit, focuses on
simple objects from everyday life,
such as food, clothes and toys. He

Wayne Thiebaud continues to

sees himself“as a traditional painter,

Students in art critique group aren’t worried
about stepping on each other’s toes

Contributor and Arts Columnist

VERY Thursday night at
7:30 p.m. Carlos 1.
Ferguson, Lecturer in Art

and a member of the Class of
‘92. can be found conducting a
critique group in the Fine Arts
Building with a group of six or
seven dedicated art students.

For approximately two hours,
the students engage in critical
discussion of each other’s _work,
examining and analyzing ele~
merits of composition, texture,
medium and color. Although the
sessions are open to any student,
the highly self-motivated and fo-
cused nature of the group deters
casual attendance.

According to Ferguson, "the
jump from doing only assigned
work to creating art for yourself
is an important one."

For this reason, the students
are encouraged to bring pieces
they have been working on out-
side of class, By fostering an
environment similar to graduate
level studies, Ferguson said, “I
hope to prepare students who are
intercstcdin continuingin art for
both graduate school and their

own endeavors."

The idea for the group came
to Ferguson as an undergraduate
at Grinnell. While doing an
independani project with Asso-
ciate Professor of Art Anthony
Crowley, Ferguson and fellow
student Kate Leonard met one
evening a week to discuss and
critique each others‘ work.

These meetings proved ex-
traordinarily helpful to Ferguson,
who later found them to be acom-
mon practice while attending
graduate school at the Univeristy
of Iowa.

Upon returning to Grinnell
last spring as a Lecturer,
Ferguson once again began the
critiquing sessions , this time, as
the teacher.

The reaction of students has
been overwhelmingly positive.

“It has been tremendously
helpful to my work," said Melr
issa Laird, a junior art student
and regularparticipantofthe cri-
tique groups. “Not only is it in
formative to hear what other stu-
dents have to say about your
work,butalsoithelpsto see what
people are domg outside of class.
People aren't tiprtoeing around,

trying not to hurt your feelings,“
Laird noted. “They give you an
honest opinion."

Rachel Rush. a fourthryear
Psychology major, also had high
opinions of both the critique
group and of Mr. Ferguson.

Though she has attented only
two of the critiquing sessions,
Rush felt that the relaxed atmo-
sphere, as well as a genuine in
terest in other's work, made the
group beneficial.

Mr. Ferguson, however, will
not remain in Grinnell to cone
tinue the critique group. His po-
sition as Lecturer expires at the
end of this semester.

After travelling, Ferguson
plans to return to graduate school
and complete his MFA “Acar
demics provides ameansamcans
of support while I continue my
own artistic endeavors," said
Ferguson, “While teaching lime
its my time, it allows me to break
free of the economic restraints
put on artists who must sell their
work."

“He's a wonderful teacher,"
Said Rush. “Its toobad he’s leave
ing. It would be great ifwe could
keep him."

Blues band ﬁnds populariiy
college, fans around Grinnell

M 0j0 Machine improvises, gears music to speciﬁc audiences

By SARAH STAVETEIG

Arts 8r. Entertainment Editor

I OCAL blues band Maja Ma
chine gets its name from a
small voodoo statue that

Guitarist Craig Bass Carries where.

The pipe, which he bought in New

Orleans, was named Mojo after their

first performance last year. Mojo has

become a good luck symbol for the
hand because “it keeps on kicking,"
according to Drummer Jo Sutton.

So does the band.

Since Its beginning a year and a
half ago, Moja Machine has per-
formed extensively around Grinnell,
including at parties, bars, and a blues
concert, Last month, they played in
Newton at a benefit for the South
Skunk Blues Society. On February
25,M0joMachmewillbringtlieblues
to State Street.

To band members, Mojo Mar
chine never set out to be anything
less than a performance band.

“It was always a goal [to per-
t‘orm],"said Sutton. “We nevermeant
for our music to stay in the basement
or in the garage. We were always
really interested in sharing ourinusic
withpeopleantlwatchingpcopiehavc
a good time."

And have a good time they do.
The audience’s enthusiasm is pre-
cisely what Mujo Mac/tine thrives
on.

“[Thc audience] Just drives you
tnoi-c,"saidBass. “Isce peoplcdanc-
ing and getting into our music, and it
JUSl drives me that much more."

Alan Hanlcy, harmonica and
vocals, added “As long as cvcryonc
has a good time, that's what counts."

“Wc’rc deﬁnitely interested In

engaging ouraudience.“ said Sutton,

And the audience has plenty of
good things to say about the band.
After the recent concert in Newton,
Junior Tanya Hedgessaid “I thought
they did really well. llike the sound
they have. Its more of a real sound.
Its real blues versus stage blues. You
can tell that they really feel the music
and like it. Their music is alive."

Junior Dave Friedman, who has
been a fan since Mojo Machine ﬁrst
began, also enjoys listening to them
play. “What I like most is their one
ergy and the spontinaeity of their
[music]. Its always adit’ferent expe-
rlence. and its always a good experi~
81166."

Perhaps one of the reasons for
the success of Mojo Machine is that.
they gear each performance toward
the speciﬁc audience.

“There W|ll be certain Crowds
where we play different songs that
aren’t really traditional blues." said
Bass, “The college party scenes tend
to enjoy jamming more because its
more nonrtraditional music."

The band melnbcrscame to Grinr
nell from Chicago, Memphis, Cedar
Rapids. West Virginia attd New Or-
leans,

Neither Hanley nor Bass have
taken formal lessons. They learned
simply bylistcning. Asaresult, none
ofthcirmusicis written dowti. Hanlcy
explalncd "The math idea is that
[songs] arcsomcthing wecan cltangc.
There is definitely a framework to
work around for each one. But each
time we play it, we do something a
little bit differently."

“Its rarely exactly the same
