Bicycle Thief

by Vincent Prosser

“Bicycle Thiei," directed by Vile
torio De Sica, is one of the purest.
bestrknown, and most inﬂuential oi
neorrealist films. Ihe term ”neor
realism" was invented by the
French “cineastes” to describe
this genre oi Italian postwar
Cinema in which small events and
modest lives are treated very
realistically. in this film, not only
are the actors all amateurs and
irom the class they portray, but De
Sica also makes Rome his set, This
was a very new concept for the
then extremely studio-bound
ltalian film makers

The use of outdoor action brings
up the question oi dubbing. The
Version we See will be subtitled,
but it will be at the same time dubs
bed, because that was how they did
the soundtrack for the original
ltalian version, ltaly is iamous ior
having the world’s best dubbing
studios, and many oi Italy's iilms,
probably most, are dubbed
because that gives more ireedom
to the lilming process. Dubbing
provides a means oi overcoming
problems posed, ior instance,
when one is outdoors and unable to
get good sound.

The use or outdoor sets gives a
freedom to this ﬁlm that it would
not otherwise have. In fact. De
Sica was largely lilming without a
script and allowed his actors to im-

pl'ovise In this, De Sica was very
lucky in his choice or actor lor the
role oi the protagonists young son
A major character in the lilm, he is
also one oi the most charming
screen urchins in the history oi
cinema

De Sica Is, above all, the director
oi children, His young actors are
engaging. lively. and very natural.
But be Sica contrasts them with
their elders. In this film, as in
“Shoeshine” and “The Children
are Watching Us," the child loses
innocence and a certain joyful
spontaneity when laced with an
adult world of cruel economic
necessity, The child learnes deceit
and hypocrisy. This sad lesson is
not completely learned in “Bicycle
Thief,” and the protagonist and his
son are reunited.

However, the economic condi»
tions oi the characters are quite
bad. At the beginning oi the lilm,
the protagonist is out bi work.
Weak and a little eccentric. he is
away lrom the others who are
listening to the lists oi jobs
available; he has given up.
Through amazing good luck,
however, he linds a job, it requires
a bicycle, but he will ﬁnd one. To
do so, he and his wile pawn their
marriage linens, a sacriiice shared
by many, tor the pawnshop has
linens literally up to the ceiling.

with bike in hand, the man
begins his rounds. One or the best
scenes in the movie shows the
workers (they post signs
throughout Rome) beginning their
rounds in the early morning, The
scene has an elegiac beauty which
demonstrates the Jay the pro-
tagonist must ieel at again having
work and a means oi support But,
with the robbing oi the bicycle, his
gladness quickly crashes, Once
again. his young son is the bread
winner lor the iamily. The two,
man and boy, search ior the bike
and come across many lives more
saie and secure then their own.

i cannot stress enough the imr
portance and influence of this film.
it may not be on lists oi the most
important iilms oi all time (as are
“Citizen Kane” and Rosselini's
“Voyage in Italy," which are bor~
ing films about boring people), but
it has great beauty. The whole idea
oi taking such a simple plot, and,
largely through the use oi ”real
time," i'leshing it out, was com-
pletely new. More recent films
about men and their bicycles may
pay sly homage to this lovely iilm
which is iull oi the pastorialism
and aifectiun‘for simple lives for
which De Sica is famous.

All About Eve

by Bruce Emond

Bette Davis is rigidly deiined in
many a iiimgoer's mind as a
sophisticated and intelligent ace
tress, one who is ideal ior playing
the sardonic matron or the
overbearing matriarch, Too oiten
one iorgets that Davis was a major
dramatic actress during the 19305
and' early 19405; her ac-
complishmcnts in movies like
“Jezebel" and “The Old Maid"
have been buried under the fre-
quently bizarre characters she
played during her later career.
“All About Eve," a 1950 iilm
directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, is
Davis’s archetypal “bitch" role,
and her characterization oi an agr
ing, embittered actress is a camp
tour de force.

“All About Eve” details the rise
oi Eve (Ann Baxter) irom a naive
schoolgirl who is besotled with the
screen characters she sees at the
movies to the strident. hardened
actress she eventually becomes
On her way to the top, Eve en-
counters a myriad oi theatre
characters and hangerscn, all oi
whom she manipulates and
discards to achievc her goal.

Baxter plays the title character
in an Oscarrwlnning pcrioi-mance,
yet it is Davis as Margo who
dominates this movie, Between
pulls on her cigarette, she spouts
disarmingly witty and acerbic
observations Her hair, lacquered
into a rigid, Cleopatrarllke style,
her large, toodeiined lips, and her
huge eyes cradled in arched
eyebrows compound the camp and
pathetic quality oi her character
Her meeting with a young actress,
played by Marilyn Monroe, is
briei, but Davis magniiicently con-
,vcys her disdain through her Clips
ped ,delivery and dismissive
gestures.

“All About Eve" is an ill~
teresting and intriguing lilm; one
doubts that the internal squabbling
and backrstabbing in the theatre
world had changed since this lilm
was made The viewer might think
that he has meta bitch or two in his
time, yet Daws's Margo brings a
whole new delinition to the word.
For Davis‘s character alone, go
and see ”All About Ev "

by Brian Jean-Luc Berger

Why would someone want to live
in Manhattan, as opposed to say
Bellerose, Queens or Rockaway,
New Jersey? In his iilm “Manhar
tan," Woody Allen shows us why.

Written by Allen and Marshall
Brickman and directed by Allen,
“Manhattan" gives an idealized
picture oi the city. Allen‘s New
York does exist but only
sometimes and in some places.

lsaac Davis (Allen) is a writer
who is in love with three women 7
Mary Wilke lDiane Keaton),
Tracy (Mariel Hemingwayi, and
some other woman 1 iorget are the
objects oi his lust and aiiection.
They are all involved with writing,
and there are numerous literary
and cinematic allusions The basic
theme is that relationships are
overall a pain in the ass, rarely
ever lazy. but lun, l-lepcats out
there will notice the similarities
between “Manhattan" and Orson
Welles’ “Lady in Shanghai.”
Again, as in ”Annie Hall,” the
neurotic New York Jew is ialling in
love with shiksas. Allen is gooiy,
but his irreverent humor and truly
caring personality overcome his

lack oi classic physical beauty.
The artist is a romantic lighting
against reality by having aiiairs
with all sort oi beautilul women
(and girls, Mariel’s character is
only sixteen, oh man...)

Overall I love the city and liove
Woody Allen. This iilm kicks ma-
jor ass and conclusively proves
that ideally, New York is the best
city in the world. Even in the real
world, the iact that despite the pro-
blems, artists like Allen make
lilms like this praising their town
is prooi oi its continuing vitality.

Think about it, Spike Lee, Martin
Seorcese, and Woody Allen. All
these directors make iilms in or
about New York City. Ethnicity
reigns supreme (Black, ltalian,
Jew) in these directors’ iilms but
doesn’t become oppressive or eXr
elusive to the rest oi society. What
I'm getting at is you'll never ever
have a “Chicago" or “Cleveland"
because the people aren't there
and the history isn't there.

Second Awakening
of Christa Kludges

by Zoe Streeker

“Second Awakening oi Christa
Kludges” is the iirst lilm by the
German ieminist writer and direc
tor Margarethe Von 'i‘mtta. She is
considered the leading spokesper-
son oi the new German cinema and

this ﬁlm is considered her best. ’

The story is simple, but the
underlying iorces are complex: A
young woman decides to rob a
bank in order to iinance her day
care center and iinds that her
associates won't accept the stolen

money. Within the big adventure
the issues which capture our atten-
tion concern uncertainty and the
need to take risks and make
choices. This is another wonderful
iilm brought to Grinnell by the
Noun program ior Women’s
Studies and the SGA Film Commit-
tee.
