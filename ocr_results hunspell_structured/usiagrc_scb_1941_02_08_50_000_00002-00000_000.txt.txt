C What, Again?

Amidst the flurry of reorganization of stue
dent government, the White House dilemma,
and of course the curriculum, we note that
the chapel committee has been reorganized.
Coming at this particular time, we con?
mend the chapel committee for its 011' iliale
ity and expect startling developments to be
forthcoming.

Judging from the record of the chapel

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

committee ist ye‘ r, we wonder if there is
any signifi ance in the decision to change
its name to the Board of Religion, It is
difficult to critic'ce its record, just as it is
difficult for a professor to criticize a blank
examination. Either he can dismiss the
case as hopeless, or he can attempt to pass
along a little much-needed advice with the
fond hope that it will be heeded, We in
tend to resort to the latter alternativeibut
with the same feeling of futility and de—
span

As is so often the fai ’ng of appointed
studentrcommittees, it is not long~ before
they lose all contact whatsoever with their
constituents, and hie themselves away to a
dark room where they may discuss and cone
spire to their heart’s content. We grant that
a certain amount of contemplation, especially
concerning matters pertaining to religious
endeavor, is essential. But ideas must be
transformed into an active, successful pro-
gram or they lose most of their value. To
say that this year‘s chapel and Vesper pro—
grams, judged from the standpoint of at
tendance or content, have been even model'-
ately successful, is an overstatement.

Therefore, we have the following slig‘gese
'tion to make. To promote a closer student
interest and feeling of participation ill the
chapel and vesper services, we make the
novel suggestion that they should be coil-
sulted as to the type of programs they would
enjoy and subsequently support. And how
could this suggestion be carried ollt more
happily than by a brief questionnaire to in-
clude space for suggestions or expressions
of approval and disapproval of certain spe-
cific propositions?

Reorganization implies new and increased
activi Let us hope that the recently re,
organized board of religion will act ilitellie
gently soon.

What Are The
English Plans,
Harris Asks

By Willhm G. Harris.—

Biggest cause of Congess‘ionaljab-
ber these days is Smilin’ Frank's
latest brain—child, the famed lend-
lease bill which authorizes the
White House to give or lend John
Bull any American item save
Eleanor's unmentionables, And in
this Jabber charges of ”dictator-
Ship” and pleas for the "foul'
freedoms" have flown thick and
fast.

But in our opinion little of
What has been said or written
really Clarifies the basic issues
which should govern the bill's ali-
ceptance or rejection.

First of all,'is it to Llie best
interests of this country to link
our fortunes and our resources
as closely as is contemplated by
H. P». 1776 to a belligerent na-
[ion who refuses to state its
objectives in the current conflict?
This country is required under
this unprecedented legislation to
throw its entire national economy
into a war upon the side of an
empire whose interests and ultir
mate aims remain a mysterious
secret. Aside from the obvious
motive of self-preservation, there
has been little indication as to
what our English cousins are
fighting for.
o o u
Surely. it would not be un-
reasonable for “S to ask what
type of peace we are being rc-
quested to expand our resources
to obtain. The Nazis have been
quite frank, We know What type
of “world order" they intend to
establish if victorious. And We
know, too, that their program is
not to our liking. But do we
know, therefore, that His MajeSv

ty’S government.» visions u post-

r order in entire keeping with
our ideals? Or is there again a
danger of our fighting another
war “to make lhc world safe for
democracy" only to discover that
(nu- allies' aims do not coincide
with our own?

Secondly, Should we not ask
om selves whether or not it would
he to our military best infer-
(‘sis to devote so much of our
production to arming Britain
rather than building our own
defenses? With the obligation of
defending an entire hemisphere
against possible enemies from
both Europe and the Orient, cerr
lainly it would bchcove us to
place the welfare of our own arm-
ed forces far above that of ANY
olher nation.

And thirdly, should we not in—

r,dirc as to whether or not it lies

wilhin our power to dictate what
type of government, economic and
social organization should prevail
upon the Continent? H. R. 1776
is based upon the promise that it
is our duty and within our abili-
t = to determine the outcome of
mu European war. And it )5
nauiiy admitted by all infcimcd
opinion that if the aid authorized
by H. a, 1776 is insufficient for
accomplishing that aim, outright
war- will supplement that aid,

But can H R. 1776 or even a
long and brutal war change the
Eulopean order that is emerging
day by day? if notAif this new
order, so distasteful to us at
present. is the result of forces
which American intervention can
not control, then certainly wc

OPEN FORUM

 

To the Editor:

At a recent meeting of the proc-
tors, recommendations lo the
faculty upon the extension and
“improvement" of the proctoring
system were discussed.

Present at that meeting but
denied the privilege of submitting
our objections to Lhese recommen-
dations with the report of the
faculty, we take this opportunity
of publicly discssociating our.
selves from that body of “student
leaders” who would save Grinneil
morality by installing a proctor
at every colleglanls elbow. Our
reasons for refusing to endorse
and advocate the extension of the
pl‘octoling system are as follows:

(1) Evcu after our repented rc-
que for such inlonnatioil, no
unc in the group was able to set
mini imv concrete or lasting
beneﬁts resulting from the recent
proctoring episode, instead, all in—
(“cations are that the whole pro»
gram was considered by the Stu-
dent body but a laughable fiasco,

(2) Stlidcnts‘liabitually refuse
to indict their fellows. For all
practical purposes, therefore,

stopping cribbing remains a mat-
ter for the professor.
“(3) in the long run, the cribber
injul'cs only himself, and if his
intellectual integrity is at so low
an ebb as to permit cheating,
planting a proctor in every dark»
ened corner is not going to fit
him for Saint Peter overnight. It
is, instead, a fruitless and irritat-
mg practice for that majority of
students Who are honest.

Out of the
Crack-Pot

By Ken

Pearce and Mathews

EDITOR'S NOTE: With thlsissue
the Scarlet and Black introduces
a new column, ”Out of the
Crack-Pot,” which Will attempt to
interpret campus news. Crack—Fat
and its tongue—in-cheek news an-
alysis may appear weeklyide-
pendent upon its reception,

The new Senior Seminar plan
listens well. However, we hope
that the administration will be
realistic enough to wind up the
sessions with a recruiting officer
to pick up pOSSible left-overs.

The pi-octors'have come and
gone with examinations. Sources
close to the plans‘ instigatoi's say
the idea was to Show the faculty
that Grinnell students are inter
ested in cribbing. This seems
sillyithel‘e wouldn't be any if the
students weren’t intercstcd,

Our sc‘outs report that R, C.
Young has already given New
Fedagogue Fetzcr some timely
advice on teaching Council Pres-
ident Young's key to successi
“give ’em drop quizzes frequent—

A definite surprise to many
was the closing of the White
House. That the White House
has at last amounted to Some-
thing, if only an emergency,
came as a shock, We are sure
that the Student Council was just
as suipi'iscd as We were. Since
the executive committee has on
its hands at the present time,
besides the White House:

1. The Emergency Committee——
Jones, Smith, Banta, Gilbert,
Potter, Goodnow, George.

2. The White House Committee
aJones, Barrett, Ci-cwder, Lay.

3. Shelton L. Beatty.

We note that President Stevens
and the Scarlet and Black have
been quick to cry ”treason" it
the whispering campaigns of foes
of the administration. We admire
the hardy Souls. who, not being
content with passwe resistance
to the administration, venture
forth to wage rumors.

The grapevine has it that the
Junior Prom may be subsidized by
the administration, and that its
publicity value Will far exceed
the novel beard growing routine
which turned the national spot-
light on Grinnell earlier this year.

We see that the new and en-
