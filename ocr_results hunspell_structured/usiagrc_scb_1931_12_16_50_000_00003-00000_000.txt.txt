"It is too hard work and takes for

ltoo much time for the small returns

l‘the women send their laundry home

'o.enough worlr to nearly pay ‘for my

after Christmas."

Next semester Miss Upson plans to
work part time at the local glove
-faetory and take a room in the quad—
trangle, instead of living in townas
she now does. She contemplates of-
fering a course in interior home dec-
lorating to townswomen next year.

She is taking 10 hours of school
work, majoring in social science and
minoring in botany. “In two years I
hope to teach or do social service work,
and save enough money so I can go
home and direct the work in my fath—
er‘s nursery," Miss Upson concluded.
