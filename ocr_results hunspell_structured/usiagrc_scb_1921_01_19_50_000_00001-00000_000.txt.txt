Prohibition Efforts

That the laboring classes are less

that students in foreign schools which

he had recently addressed, especially'

in England, 10an upon America's re-

Taken Asﬁiterion of
Future Progress
0f Campaign

That the eyes of the Grinell
alumni and the rest of the world
are on Grinnell during the present
campaign is stated in a communica-
tion on the student work just re-
ceived from Lyman P. Powell, dis
rector- of the Grinnell Movement
work in the east. He has been in
touch with the endowment drives
of a large number of other 0017
lcges ,and sends the following mes—
sage to Grinnell, in a special or
ticle written for the Scarlet and
Black, H15 article follows:

“To be a student at Gnnnell has
always been an honor and a priv-
ilege. in these days it is also
a glorious responsibility.

“By his ioresight, courage, con-
secration and wisdom, President
Main has become the foremost
spokesman for the American cola
loge in the country at this crisis
in collegiate education. He has
put Griunell at the head 01' all our-
institutions both in under-standing
of the situation and in dealing with
it.

"The Grinnell Movement moves
in the interest of Grinnell and at
the headlof itll our institutions both
in runderstanding of the situation
and in dealing with‘ it '

“The Grinnell Movement moves
in the interest of Grinnell and ztt
the same time in the interest of all
our Christian colleges.

“Where some other institutions
have made the mistake of seeking
first aid elsewhere, Grinnell wisely
seeks it first aid of all at home.

“The noble pledge made by the
faculty to the Grinnell endowment
has inspired faculties elsewhere.
The magnificent development or the
sense of responsibility in Grinnell,
Marshalitown, Des Moines, and 01h-
er 1owa centers is firing the env
thusiasrn of Grinncllians and their
friends the country over.

‘The splendid interest the stun
dents are showing will kindle stu-
dent interest everywhere. An em-
inent educator has just said to me
over the telephone: “The Griunell
lsculty and students are setting
an example to all faculties and
students. They must be a fine lot.“

“From the New York office, raps
idly becoming a clearing house for
various institutions which want to
know how Grinneil does it, 1 send
to every Grinncll student this greet
ins: Do your best. No students in
the country have now a greater ops
portunity than you to help all while
You help Grinuell. no more than
your best. Send me word which
I can send to students everywhere
that the students of Grinnell today
rccosniye their full responsibility
and nre‘ eager to dischargc it to
the full."

what they are doing. It is beautiful.
No wonder Old Grinnell is proud of
