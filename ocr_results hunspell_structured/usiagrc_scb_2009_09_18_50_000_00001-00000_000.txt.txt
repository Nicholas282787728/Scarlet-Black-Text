Smaller groups were rhea formed, according the attendees ear
miliaxity and experience with genderrneutralii’y, to continue the disV
cussion in a more intimate vmy.

“On one hand we wanted to have a diversity of experience to
have a mono productive conversation, but on the othm hand some
people felt mat the discussions really have to be tailored to people's
needs in rho sense that some pcoplc maybe coming in there not really
knowing the distinction between sot and gender," Thomson said.
‘We have to really hy the groundwork to have a conversation and
we want to tailor it to pcopc’s needs so that one person isn‘t lost and
another person isn’t completely bored.”

In addition to organizers facilitating an expansion ofeommunity

need for continued expansion orgenderrneunal housing on campus.

“We don't oEer gondcrrncutral in all our types of housing like
Olir campus Language Housos, so that’s an area that it's clear we
need to work on," Conner said. “We need to have gendcrrncucml
housing in all housing options.”

in the open forum, Conner cited that Grinncli doesn’r Currently
otter any gender neutral housing options in substance-free housing
or in cvcry duster.

Though Gnnncll campus is still striving in errorrs (0 become
more gondcrrneutral, the open forum provided a muchrnccdcd to
rum for studenm, faculty and staff to ask questions and become more
educated,

“Ijust thought itvlms great,”Grcg Parks '11 said.“Wc got to learn
more speciﬁcally what’s going on with gender-neutrality and prog-

However, some students left with more questions.

“For me the whole pronoun thing Was perplexing going in. I re

Student Affairs cracks down on cats

Due to complaints from students and parents, Resident Life confronts cat owners

Ev BASSILALCHEIKH

Dcspicc last year’s lcnicncc with cars on campus, stu-
dent Affairs has begun to take steps towards reducing cats
in campus dorms citing complaints from students and par
cnts to take action against the dorm pcts.

According to the Office of Student Affairs, the calls
and complaints regarded the estimated 10-15 cats on cam-
pus1"Thc calls were in reference [0 the fact that we have,
in print, a policy about catsithey're not allowed in the
residence halls,” said Andrea Conner, the Assistant Dean
of Students ScDircctor of Residence Life and Orientation.
“The complaints were that we are not enforcing this policy,
and that even in a self-governing community, the college
needs to respond to thcsc sorts ofviolation
a violation that the parents feel is scrious.”

According [0 Connor thc solution
stood out at the ofﬁce of Student Affairs.
“The fairest thing to do was to converse
with those who have cats on campus,"
Conner said. "The point of the conver
sation was to ﬁnd alternatives for having
cats 1ch on campus, not just kick out the
cats. It‘s not O.K. with ma for a cat to have
no shelter and be neglected."

Conner, along with RLCs Eric Vos (Jamalnnd)
and Rachel Wike (Loosehead), approached several stun
dents with cars and discussed viable alternatives “The
conversations we had with the cat owners discussed the
differences in intcrcsts between the Office ofStudent Afr
fairs and the cat owners themselves,” Vos said.

While the cat owners’ intuests lie in having friendly

companions, “Student Affairs’ interests lay in making sure
students feel they are safe in the environment, and to be
consistent with enforcing rules that apply to cvcryone,”Vos
said.

Vos was impressed with rhe way the car owners hanr'
dlcd the situation, and how they responded with multiple
solutions. “We had very, very good conversations with the
owners,"Vos said. “l've been really impressed with how em-
powered rhe students are, as the owners were able to draw
out many different solutions, including the possibility of a
catrfriendly residence hall."

Conner agrccd. "I'm happy to say that the conversations
we had w1th students were very thoughtful, mature and rc-
spccrful, despite rho tough nature or the
conversation,” she said,

Some cat owners were understanding
of Student Affairs' concerns, and apprcr
ciarcd how well the conversations went.
"Andrea Conner was a good listener,"
Mona Ghadiri '11 , who owned one of
the cars on campus, said “She was trust-
worthy, and I didn’t feel like she was just
humoring me,”

Initially, Conner and the RLCs did not look forward
to confronting the issue, since there is considerable emo,
tion involved with keeping cats as pets, and the question
of floor sclf—govcrncnc: playing a role in the discussions.

“It's a tough position we were 'tn,"Vos said. “The issue
wasn’t high on our agenda and we certainly didn‘t want to
be labeled ‘cat Nazish However, as
