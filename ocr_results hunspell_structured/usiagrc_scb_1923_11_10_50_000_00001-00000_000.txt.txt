WALLESER PLANS
FRENCH COTTAGES

Professor Adopts Architecture As
Present Avocation.

Prof. Joseph Walleser of Gl'innell
college, who is now located in Paris
on a leave of absence, has temporar—
ily deserted his prnfession as a. teach»
er of English Composition and has
adopted as an avocation, thc builds
ing of cement cottages for the peas
ants in the devastated regions or
France. In conjunction with a. group
of Americans who have made a spec-
ial study of the construction of small
houses of four to six rooms in size
and of moderate cost, Mr. Walleser is
making ,plans for these cottages with
emphasis upon the artistic as well as
practical side of their construction.

A few weeks ago, Mr. Wallcser
spent ten days in the United States
studying the plans of certain houses
in Rochester, N. Y. which exemplify
the qualities to he incarnated in the
houses to be built in France: artis-
tic exterior and interior; compact-
ness; and economy.

For recreation, Mr. Walleser is
studying French literature and mak-
ing some metrical translations of
French poetry,

ﬂHAMATIS BUMP PTTTYS

First Program Combines Fantasy
With Clever Comedy And
Industrial Drums.

“Say it again—Minikinwh, Mania
kin”‘1nd thus in their rythmic wcy
speak the two little bisque figures of
"lilanikin and Minikin", .one of the
three plays to be presented November
17th by the class, in dramatic produc-
tion. Even little statuettes can’t be
expected to keep all of their Wrath
pent up,

,The “Idyll of the Shops" does not
share the oddity and dcintiness of
Kl‘eymborg‘s fantasy. An element of
discouragement creeps into the sweat
shop, for it is a slack season. Among
these surroundings a romance finds
its stal but how can‘ anything really
prosper in a sweat shop? No one can
tell when he is going to be thrown out
of work. it is in this play that the
strains of the hand organ come drift-
ing in midst the hum or the busy sew-
ing machines.

Millie’s light comedy. “Whrzel Finln»
mery" offers a decided contrast to
both o: these plays. The situation is
a ridiculous one, and the clever lines
only help to make the effect more
amusing. The solicitor, who is really
superb as one, is more than funny;
he is very important. if anyone wants
to know what simply ridiculous things
people have done for money, he might
tell. ‘

Brookhztrt’s Renomination M ll. 11 e
Question of Annual Mold-ill
,Trophy Contest.

in the eleventh annual Merrill do
hate Wednesday crcning Forum’s team
elfcciivcly made good its‘chztllenge to
Institute society for this year’s debate
honor-s, winning the contesthyo five
to one decision. The qucsticn, ‘re—
solved that Brookhart ho rcnominat—
etl,‘ was one which offered hoth ai-
firmntive and negative splendid argu~
mcnts.

The affirmative, composed at John
Talbott, 0tha Wearin and Paul Porter.
based their resolution on three points:
first, that Brookhart't past warrants
his renomlnetion; second, that his
policies are practical; and third,ltha.t
he is qualified [or renomination. In»-
stitute’s negative team, composed oi:
Donald Wilson, Emil Bilharz and
James Work, endeavored to show
that Bl‘ookhart’s character is quest-
ionable, that his stand with regard
to the railroads is wrong, that
his plan ot cc—opcrative adjustment is
impractical, and that he is a’ breed-
er of class dlssention. Both team
came back with forceful rebuttal. As
a result of the outcome of the contest
Forum society will receive Mr. Mer-
rili’s prize or sixty dollars and will
hold the debate honors until some
other challenging team wins. Ac<
cording to schedule Cresto society
will be the challenger next year.

Professor Spencer acted as chair-
man of the debate. The judges
were: H. L. Beyer, Rev, n. W. Cross,
Professor D. N. Crass, Dr. W. R. Kin—
zer, Professor Rutherford, J. G. Shi -
fist, and rrofessor C. N. Smiley.

Excellence of Playing Makes
Heavy Program Acceptable
To Large Audience.

The Grinnell Strrng Quartet appear—
ed belore a large and appreciative
gathering in Herrick chapel last eve»
hing. Their‘s was ‘nut a light pro-
gram, and it was only the excellence
of their playing which held the duals
cncc.

Commencing their program with
the Hayden Quartet, opus 64, No. a,
the artists created striking musical
effects. Their playing was thought—
ful and precise; the ensemble was
perfect but there was little br‘illiancy.
, lsahella-Eeatou‘s “Chel'zo” was well
received. It is a charming composi-
tion and the quartet played it in a
buoyant fashion. The Beethoven
Quartet, opus 59, No. one, was the
most amh ious undertaking on the
programs Here the artists were at
their best, playing in splendid _ ac-
cord, portraying a mood or an em-
otion. Here was excellent music,
with eftects well sustained, depth of
tone, and hrilliancy of finish.

The quartet was enthusiastically
recalled for several encores. They
responded with selections at a lighter
vein, and gave proof of their versatils
ity.

' Well Known Speaker

Due to an unforeseen emergency the
time set for the lectures of Miss Sarah

Wembaugll on inter-national relations .

has been slightly Changed so that the
lecture on “The League oi Nations"
will come on Tuesday night instead of
Monthly night as advertised. The lec7
ture on the World Court Will be de-
livered Tuesday at nine-forty accord-
ing to 912 original Schedule. This will
bring hoth lectures on Tuesday, one
at the chapel hour and‘ one in the eve—
ning at eight o'clock.

Members of the Crinnell faculty
who know Miss Warnhaugh either per»-

sonally or through her work “zoom;

mend her very highly as a speaker
who is thoroughly familiar with her
field and also as one who can express
her thoughts in a decidedly charming
manner. “Miss Wamhaugh can really
pot life even in the supposedly pros
saic subject or boundaries", said one
member of the faculty who heard her
speak recently.‘

At the Williamstown Conference
this last summer Miss Wamhaugh
was one of the most respected author—
ities in that distinguished gathering
and was frequently appealed to for
advice by statesmen of World—wide
reputation.

It is expected that the lectures by
Miss Wambztugh will be exceptionally
well attended because of the fact that
the theme of her talks will connect
closely with many of the courscs of
the social science departments and
also with the trend of the most im~
portrnt events of current history.
