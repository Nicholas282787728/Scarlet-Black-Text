the isolation ward at Com-
munity hospital, Grinnell was
confronted with a threat of

The threat became tlou-
bly powerful when it was

been waiting on tables in
the dormitory diilirt ooni
during the most contagious
stage of the disease.

Most people haven't seen a walk—
ing tree outside the ”Wizard of
02," but 800 Grinnell students,
faculty and friends watched trees
saunter trsely around the high
school stage last night and loved
it, Visible scenery changes, how-
ever. were only one of the fea—
tures of the Chekhov Players’ per—
1 o r m a n c e of Shakespeare's
“Twelfth Night" that made it the
most unusual and aatlszying
dramatic experience in Grinnell
this year.

The prospect at seeing a
Shakespeai-ian play in what ad—
vance notices term “trua Shakes-
perian style" is usually unpleasant.
because it means foregoing much
or the color, and appeal settings
give. Seeing a Shakespeare play
with all the trappings is more un-
pleasant, for, it means intermins
able blank pauses while scenery
is arranged for the many settings
of the five sets.

But the Chekhov, players have
succeeded in combining the best
beatures of the two schemes with-
out heing forced to include the
unpleasant ones. This they do by
simple but versatile props, and by
the most ingenious blending of
stage mechanics into stage ac-
tion. Properties were moved while
tho audience watched. and moved
so skillfully and in such patterns
of balance and rhythmn that they

oeminly none of the color pos.
sible in Shakespeare was missed
in the costumes and scenery. for
they were as gay and sparkling
as the laughter of Maria. But in
the ll-soene comedy there was
only one curtain, and this for only
a 15—minute intermission, Other-
