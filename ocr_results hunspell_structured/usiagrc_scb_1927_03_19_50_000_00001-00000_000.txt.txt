Mack Describes Drama. Club Play
As Powerful and Moving
Performance.

INFELT SUDGEEDS WITH LEM]

Add Selby Effective In
\ Their Roles.
" lly l H. Mock.

The total impression made by the
presentation of Charming Pollock's
"The Fool” at the Colonial theatre on

,chnesday evening rvas that of one of
the most powerful and moving peie
formances which the Dramatic clrrh
has sponsored recently in Griunoll.
lidsether this was due to the charac—
ter of the play, its large ensemble,
the dramatic climaxes, the strong con-
trasts, the superb acting, the effec-
tive stage sets or to a happy Combina—
tion of all these, anally rate many
came away feeling they had had an im-
portant aesthetic and spiritual expel
ence. Too much praise cannot be
given to, the Club which presented it,
the Experimental Theatre which pro»
duced it and to Mr. Angus who direce
ted it to an artistic triumph,

Play “Collies Hollie."

The play itself, whatever distorted
notions may have got abroad, is one
which in Bacon's ﬁne praise, "comes
home to men's business and bosoms."
The action grorvs out of the persist
ent efforts of an idealistic young mill—
ister to put into practice the princi-
ples of Jesus against almost over-
whelming odds; ﬁrst as rector in a
fashionable New York City church;
second, in an attempt to settle a strike
in the West Virginia coal mines; and
ﬁnally as the moving‘ spirit of Over-
coat Hall, a. kind of rescue house for
all those who have sunk below the
lever of ordinary society. only in
the'last of these under-takings may
he be said to succeed at all and
even here his motives are maligned
and misunderstood to the degree that
he survives the attack of an infuriated
mob chiefly by the intervention of
Providence in the form of a miracle.
The 'chief instrument of this miracle
is a little crippled girl who is healed
in the process and whose audible and
repeated prayers during the mob scene

’presents one of the striking contrasts
of the play. The role of the crippled
girl was carrﬁd by Eleanor Dunton
with.just the right touch of childlike
sweetness and charm.

Freshmen Trounce .
Sophbmore Sextet

Fast Floor Work of Fresh Women
Enables Them to Defeat
Rivals 38 to 24.

The freshman women's basketball
team Thursday afternoon defeated the
sophomore sestet by r scorc of as to
24 in the fastest game of the present
season. "The preps gave a scrappy
p lcr-mauce and lost no opportunity
to take advantage of ihe sophornorcs'
inability to hang on to the hall.

Th9 sophomore team gm. it Spee
start which made the game look pr-oe
rinsing for them during the first quar-
ter, but soon their inability to get the
ripoff cost them heavily, Kelc‘h and
Thomas had no trouble in finding the
basket, and seldom far . to toss field-
goals when they reached the ball The
sophomores broke through to score ll
points during the first half, but close
guarding by the preps gave them a
hard struggle. The half ended with a
score of Is to M in favor of the fresh-
men.

l-' sh llii‘l'f'ilst‘ Imml

During the second half the prep for»
wards ran up a still greater lead in
spite of l'allins by .ietcall and part,
sophomore guards. Metcalf showed
consider-able speed, but the sophomore
machine was unable to get the ball
down the field and their game was
characterized by frequent fumbles.

East flooru-orlr was a feature of the
freshman game and enabled thern fre—
quently to outrun tlroir'onponcnts.
Mutershaugh and Hettinger, freshman
guards. repeatedly intercepted low so-
phomore passes from center and pre
vented the sophomores from scoring
consistently. Teget and Wilder played
their usual running game at ccntes.
while the accurate field shots of itelch
and Thomas were a feature of the
game. Kelch was high scorer with a
total of eleven field goals.

Scphs Show Speed

Although the sophomores failed to
work consistently, their game at times
showed flashes of real speed which
seriously threatened the lead of the
prep sextet. Stock and Schwarz, play-
iilg against taller opponents, put up a
good fight at center, and Mctcalf and
Dart gave the prep for-wards real come
petition during the second half. Wil—

FARM RELIEF BILL 'IS TBPIB

Burling'ame and Reid Grinnell
Men In Similar Debate
Al. Lincoln.

A negative team composed of Munro
Kezel' of the Urrhersity of Nebraska
and Laurence London of Griunell won
an audience decision over the affirm-
ative team composed of David Fell-
rnarr of the University of Nebraska and
Ray Clclcnd of Grrnnell in A. R, H.
auditorium last night, in one of the
best debates of the year. The subject
was the farm relief hill. ‘

Eellnran, former star debater of Om-
aha central high school, opened the
discussion with a statement of the
farmer's plight today and showed by
statistics that an inequality between
agriculture and industry was working
toward the detriment of the farmer.
The speaker showed that the. United
States had adopted a protective sys-
tcm in every line of industry except
agriculture; and with the adoption of
the bInNdly-Hailgen hill, the discrim-
ination against the farmer would be
removed,

Would Iucrcasc Surplus

In upening the case 101' the nagao
Live Lumleil rimmed out that the far-
mer was not being discriminated
against, Touching on the point of the
farmel‘s' tariff find leaving it for rec
lmttal, he took up the farrners’ plight
where Fellmfdn left off, He alleged
that the affirmative had not shown
the two basic causes of the depres-
sion and how the bill would care for
the factors causing the situation.
Laud value inflatinn and the surplus
were the two basic causes of the ﬂu"
mel‘s' ills, he declared. I! Was point-
ed out that with 148,000,000 acres of
'cnltlvatable laud idle and with the
perfect working of the MeNary-Haug-
err bill the surplus would he increas-
ed greatly. This would lntensifytho
situation. for it was said that Europe
would be unable to buy. American
products due to her inability to pay
in gold, goods. or service,

oleland contended that the whole
solution at the problem was in order-
ly marketing. He Shower] that every
line of industry had a very effective
system of marketing except the far-
mer. Under the Working 0f the bill,
adequate and orderly marketing— fae
chilies would be insured,

it was alleged by Kezer that the of—
firmative had been pursuing the wrong
direction. He claimed the affirmative
llzul failed [Q get at the heart of the
problem which was land inflation and
the surplus However, be granted
that for the moment in favor of dis-
cussing the practicability of the bill.
In theory it was simple, but insllpe
able difficulties presented themselves,
he declared. The confusion of choosing
the farm board was cited; the collec—
tion of the equalization fee was de»
clftl‘ed L0 be impossible: inability
to deter-mine the crop in advance was
brought out as another difficulty.
