The Grinnell College softball team
returned to Iowa after a strong shows
iiig in Florida and made their presence
known in the Midwest with three more
wins. After leaving Fort Myers. Fla,
with a record of 573, the Pioneers (8*
turned to Iowa to heat Augustana 7-4
on Saturday, April 1 in Rock Island,
Ill.

The softball team dropped a close,
onerrun contest to UW-LaCrosse later
that day, hutwent on to shut out Mount
Mercy College at home during a dOUe
bleheader on Tuesday. The Pioneers
defeated the Mount Mercy Mustangs
9-1 in both of their games. The pitch-
ing, defense. offense and bascrunning
have all been in sync. Head Coach Tom
Sonnichson and his team are looking to
carry the momentum through the en-
tire conference season.

"I felt the team was very excited to
be playing and that they supported one
another very well," said sonniehson.
“We have 21 players this year, so play
ing time will be an issue. Despite this,
each player seems willing to do what
they are asked in each contest. Regard-
less or Florida or at home, rhis group
brings a competitive mentality to each
game and that is what I expect."

Grinnell’s otrense has been sup-
ported by contributions from several
players, including senior outﬁelder
Karyn Wieland, who is currently hit-
ting .500 and leading the Pioneers in
hits, runs, triples and homeruns. Darcy
Ward ’09, Emily Stewart’os, and Emily
Koibe ’07 have also been providing an

“We had such a great Florida trip; it
was the best of my four yearsThis year's
team has a lot of talent and depth,"
said \Nieland. “\Ne scored 16 runs on
our first day, which is outstanding. In
years past, hitting and scoring runs was
a major weakness. We also played great
defensein Florida. We held a lot of
opponents basemnners and only made
a few errors."

The pitching this season has also
helped to build a srrong foundation

for the Pioneers as they prepare for the
conference games ahead.

“We have six pitchers rhis year and
we’re conﬁdent behind all of them,"
said Wieland.

Sonnichson wrll lean on his talent-
ed pitching staff when the conference
season rolls around. Gaby Flores ’09 has
pitched 30 innings for Grinnell and has
only surrendered six earned runs while
strlking out 35.

The arms and the bats of the softr

ball team will be tested this weekend
when the Pioneers (874) play at the
Midwest Conference Classic Tourna-
merit in Janesville, Wisc. sonnichson
will look for consistent play from his
players both in the field and in the
batter’s box. This early conference test
will give Grinnell a good idea as to how
they stack up against their Midwest
Conference competitors.

“The most impoitaiit thing we must
keep Consistent in order to win confer—

ence games is hitting and defense.This
weekend is key. We play all five North
division teams at the Crossover tourna-
ment," said Bailey Butt ’03. “we only
get one attempt at the North division
teams and it's a great opportunity to
show that we have improved from last
season. If we can continue hitting the
ball like we have thus far and play solid
defense, we will be pleasantly surprised
with the outcome of our conference
games."

Midwest Cross-
over Tournament:
The Pioneers will face
off against St. Norber,
Beloit, Carroll, Law~
rence and Ripon on
Saturday and Sunday,
April 8 and 9 in
Janesville, Wise.

The Pioneers rravcled roTucson,Ariz,,overspring
break to temper their golf game in the heat of the
southwest and play a round at the Arizona National
Golf Course.

Michael Inman ’09 posted the low round for
Grinnell, putting up an 83 in the windy conditions
of the Arizona desert.]ack Kennedy ’06 carded a 94,
while Trek Langenhan '07 ﬁnished the day with a 95.
Rob Pedersen '06 shot a 98, and Ben Johannsen '06,
Ryan Long ’08 and Joe Fox ’08 all posted a final score
of 99 for their rounds against
the University of Arizona,
Tucson.

“Windy conditions and
tough desert golf courses led
to some mediocre rounds,"
said Langenhan, "but the
tough conditions will help
prepare for the difﬁcult sched-
ule ahead. We return our top
ﬁve players from last year and
with the addition of Michael
lnman we may be able to con-
tend for one of the top several
spots in conference."

With many returning players and the addition of
some newcomers who will be making a valuable cone
tribution to the team, the Pioneers have come back to
Iowa looking to improve their games and prepare for
conference play.

“It’s nice to return to Iowa and Illinois courses
that suit our native Midwestern players a little bet-
rer," said Langenhan. “We hope to rake advantage of

ante.”

”We look as solid as we have
during the fowl/ears (have been
here. / expetl the team Io be
very (ompel/m/e In the «info-

Ben lohannsen ’06

our experience and knowledge and comp '1 at the top
level.”

The courses in lawn and Illinois will certainly be a
change from the desert course that the golfers played
in Arizona. Because weather is one of the largest is
sues for most Midwest golf teams, the Pioneers will
be using a large portion of their practice time to make
all ofthe necessary adjustments to the change in en»
vironment.

“Back north, the team will hope to finish in the
top half of the conference and will look for solid
play in some bad weather condi-
tions this spring," said Pedersen.
“There‘s no way to know how the
weather will behave, so we have
to be ready for anything."

Grinnell begins their northr
em campaign in Waverly, lown
ar the centennial oaks counrry
Club against Wartburg College.
This FridayeSaturday match will
give the Pioneers a taste of what
conference play will be like. The
early noneconference matches
will also give Head Coach Greg
Wallace a chance to decide who his top golfers are
and who will compete in rhe imporranr marches.

The Midwest Conference play ofﬁcially begins
for Grinnell next Thursday at Knox College.

“We look as solid as we have during the {our years
I have been here,"said Johminsena "I expect the team
to be very competitive in the conference. In order ro
be successful we need to capitalize on our experience
and rotate in younger players that are playing well."
