Mme. Tillisch Describes the Agil-
ity of the Dancers of Pictur-
esque Norway.

Parents raised their hands in‘hor-
ror this last year as they watched
their daughters “toddling” and "scand;
al—walking."

“Such dancing isn’t even good exer-
cise, except for the shoulders," they
walled.

in Norway, at least in rural dis—
tricls, no attempt is made to “dance
,on a dime." Madame Bel'gljot Til-
liscb, whose programs of Norwegian
folk music are so popular, describes
the native daucc oi idallihgdal, Nur—
way, which puts Lhe ”camel walk" and
its ilk ier in the shade, so iar as
real pep is concerned

Madame Tillisch will give a concert
in Herrick Chapel February 2nd.

"it takes real agility to perform Lhel
ldancizs oi the Hailingdal Valley,” tes—
tified Madame Tillisch. “The national
dance of this vicinity is so full of
jumps and leaps that all similar
dances in Norway have been named
‘Halling.’ The music‘ which \accom-
panics this strenuous dance is per-
fect, being particularly held and live—
1y. -

"Through the influence of the
music, the dancers are aspired to
leap clear of the floor. “The practiced
Hallingdalcr can kick the raiters as
he whirls In'the dance. He jumps,
light as a feather, touches the rafters
with his toes, and descends upnn one
foot. As he alighte, he whirls about,
his long coat swirling from him like
is hell. Then with a. leap, he has
reached the opposite side or the room
and continues as before.”

Our young folks probably would
ﬁnd this dance too strenuous for the
country club, fbnt the young 'Hallins
daler laughs and shouts with glee as
he leaps in the steps of the Hailing.

Madame Tlllisch learned many ol
the peasant dances during her recent
sojourn abroad, To add to her great
store of Scandinavian folk songs, she
lived for weeks among the peasants,
working and playing with these sim-
ple folk. she now is touring the
country, presenting her unique musi—
cal programs to delighted audiences.

Miss Pyle Addresses

Miss Pyle spoke on the signiﬁcance

‘TheBestBus‘iness Career

Is what every ambitious senior is
thinking about at the present time.
Life insurance is one of the best, one
of the most desirable, and one of the
most satisfactory as a permanent
calling.

ln assets and volume of business,
life insurance is one of the three lead—
‘ing businesses of this Country, yet the
ﬁeld is comparatively under—develdped.
Only 7 per cent of the economic value
of human life in the United States is
covered by insurance. This gives an
idea of the big ﬁeld still to be worked,
especially business insurance for ﬁrms’
and corporations.

, As to remuneration: Reports of
college graduates whO'have entered
business indicate that life insurance is
at the very top as a source of income.
