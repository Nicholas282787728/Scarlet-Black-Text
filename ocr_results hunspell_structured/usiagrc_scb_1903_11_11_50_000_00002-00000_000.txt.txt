never lacking for rooters
at games played in Des Moines,
yet all of the Iowa College people
of the capital city arenot sufﬁcient
untothe needs of an occasion like
the one we all look forward to on
next Saturday, At a game so
near home it will never do to
have our slogans drowned by the
conﬁdentquacks of any number
of Drakes however large. We
may imagine the blue and white
team possessed with the ambition
ofexcellingthescoremadeagainst
us by Antes. How can we show
our loyalty better than by attend-
ing the game and helping by our
presence and yells to disillusion
our Christian brethern?

F a team of lootball players
ever came out of a game
badly beaten and althe same time
loaded with glory that team was
ours at the close of last Saturday's
gamewilhAmes. Fromthesland-
point of the spectator it would be
diihcult to conceive of a team of
our weight as playing a better
game of Football tltan did the {15'
tenders oi the scarlet and black
against our old rivals from the
school which all Iowans are plottd
to proclaim as the best institution
of its lrintl in tlle west. That I. S.
Cthas a team at good football
players is plainly evident tram
the l‘CCOl'Li ltcr men have made
this year. This incl makes thel
burden of defeat an easy one to
bear especially in view oi the
splendid showing ottrtearn actua1~
ly made in spite of the ominous
sound of the score. Thetc are
occasions when speed and skill
are not a match tor ponder-nus
weight even when heaviness is ac-
companied by lack oi those de
sirablc qualities just mentioned,
but when avoirdupois and general
proﬁciency are soliappily blended
as they were in the mass forma-
tions our line was compelled to

Apparent
[y she saw something there that
offended her. Whatever the [acts
may be as to the cause for her
action it pleased her to announce
In a place, where a more discreet
person would have been content
to talk about some praiscworlhy
feature at college activity, the
general corruption and Income
petcnce of SCARLET AND BLACK.
If there be more of her ill; it is to
them and the young lady, whose
attitude prompted these remarks,
that this paragraph is hopefully
dedicated

We venture to say that this un-
kind iault ﬁnder has not the inter-
est. of all things connected with
the college more thoroughly at
heart than has the object of her
displeasure. Nevertheless it is
reasonably certain that she would
carry on the affairs of the paper
in a more acceptable manner than
they are now being administered
If such be the case we wish to
remonstr'ete with her for not hav-
ing offered us the beneﬁt or her
wide wisdom in a way that could
count for improvement, We do
not claim to be without bad faults
nor do we hope to make friends
of all who look over their neigh-
bor's shoulder to read thepages of
a neighbor's SCARLET AND BLACK.
We have our friendly critics and
we feel thankful for them, but it
is hard for us to see any blessing
from the existence of the autocrat
referred to.We want to be told of
our short comings and we will do
what we can to cure all the dis
