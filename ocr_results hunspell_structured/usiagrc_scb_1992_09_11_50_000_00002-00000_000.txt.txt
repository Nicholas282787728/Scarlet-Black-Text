Recruiting Trouble

by Trisha Howell

Rumors of the football team not
having enough players for a tcztm
havebeencirculzttingaroundthecam-
pus this year. ltis truethatGrinnell‘s
football team did have Lrouble ,3.
cruiting this year, the team consists
of34 players, but the team will func-
tion as usual and the season will go
on.

It is not unusual for a team in our
division to be lacking in players.
CollegessuchasMacalaster,Pamona,
and Oberlin all have similar prob-
lems. Recruiting is often limited by
the fact that Division III schools are
not permitted to award athleu'c schol-
arships Also, colleges in this divi-
sion are more academically demandr
ing. Practicm and games take up
valuable study time, and often Stu-
dents are forced to choose between
athletics and academics. The type of
student who attends Grinnell does
not place athletics as a number one
priority, and is not expected to.

“Nothing is going to help recruitr
ment until the administration decides
to make a financial commitment to
athletics," says Ted Stanley, senior
and co-captain of the team Stanley
described the facilities on campus as
outdated and in need of improve-
ment, attributing this to a “we don’t
care” attitude toward athletics on the
part of the administration. He also
stated that gaining funding for athe
letic teams was a continual struggle.
This disinterest in athletics by ad»
ministration and need for better fa-
cilities make recruitment even more
difﬁcult “Grinnell used to be an
athletic powerhouse,” Stanley said.
“We were good before and we could
be good again. It all comes down to
money”

Coach Greg Wallace commented
that ideally a competitive Division
III team would have between 60-65
players, but added “I think we’ve got

Peep holes — A prudent investment?

by Riva Sharples

Security and privacy in Grinncll
dorms is better this ycar due to the
addition of pccpholes on every rest
dcncc dorm dooron campus, accord
ing to Wally Walker of the Grinnell
College Facilities Managcmcnt.

“There are some 900 rooms on
campus,andcach room now hasone,"
he said. “It was done to provide
better security to thc person living in
'the room The holes are excellent to
use to screen admittanceof visitors at
the door."

The pccpholes cost the college
three dollars apiece, excluding the
installation, which was done over the
summerby Grinnellcollege employ-
cos.

Students have mixed reactions to
the holes.

“1 think it’s totally disgusting that
the college is wasting money on
them,“ said Tcs Russom, an intema-
tional student from Ethiopia. “You
can open the door and see who is
there. The holes don’t make me feel
moresecure. I’m notinNeWYork, If
you walk into the dorms. you see
open doors everywhere v they just
don’t make sense."

“I don‘t know why the college
spent money on them," said a Grin-
nell junior, who strongly refused to
give his name. “I don‘tthink anyone
uses the holes, except to see who’s
mnning down the hall. I don’t look
through it before I open the door."

Others thought of the holes as
more of a luxury than a necessity.

 

”fhcy really don‘tmake much of

a chance for a successful season,"
Grinnell'steam has 19 returningplay-
ersthis yearr "There’s alotof strength
in there,” Coach Wallace stated.

a difference to me one way or an-
other," said Chris lepscn, ‘93 Math
major. “It's kind of nice to know
who’s knocking at the door, butl do
think that there are better ways to
spend money.”

The pccpholes are a result of stu-
dcntcomplainls last year. According
tosome,solicitors sclling magazines,
rcligion,and other items were knock-
ing on dorm doors often.

Some students on campus have

not yet noticed the holes.

“I didn’t even sec it," said Darcie
Rives ‘96. “I guess now that I know
it’s there, i feel more secure. I guess,
if they make people feel safer, why
not have them?”

that need to be faced, and we need
someone to facilitate these changes
in the most effective way,” Hatzfeld
said As one way to facilitatechange,
Hatzfeld would like to create a stu-
dent committee to review the Judi-
cial Council and devise a restructur-

addition, he would work to create a

Policy Committees (SEPC). To clear
up confusion as to the purpose of the
SEPCs, l-latzfeld proposed, “devel-
oping a SEPC brochure/handbook
thatwill outlinewhattthEPCdocs.”
Halzfeld was also instrumental in
creating the Hall Council system.

ideas include creating a Disciplinary

an academic minors system “I be-
ljevehavingminorsatGrinnellwould
be beneficial in that it would give
students credit for areas which they
have studied in depth," Ostergren
saidr

Dick is also in favor of
implementing a minors system at
Grinnell. Hatzfeld is not. “On the
surface, [the minors system] looks
good," Hatzfeld said, “but after
weighing the pros and cons. 1 real-
ized that it goes against the liberal
arts system."

Dick, Ostergrcn and Hatzfeld arc
in favor of an expansion of
multiculturalism in the curriculum.
Ostcrgrcn feels,“it would be my duty
to expand multiculturalism to more
than a high school education, be-
cause multiculturalism is part of the
liberal arts education." If Dick be-
comes Vice President, he would
implement much of what College
President Pamela Ferguson has pro
posed so that Grinnell students can,
"learn about others.” Hatzfcld has
said of multiculturalism that, “it is
