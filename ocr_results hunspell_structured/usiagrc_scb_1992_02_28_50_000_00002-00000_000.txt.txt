Jewish tradition focus of project

By Karen Nutter

WhatisitliketogrowupJewishin
lowa? What is it like to be a religious
minority in a state which seems to
have more churches than grocery
stores? How haveIowa’sJewish com-
munities survived the antirSemiﬁSm
these comftelds have sometimes pro-
duced? Just ask American Studies
Professor Hanna Griff, and she’ll tell
you.

Professor Griff, in conjunction
with American Studies Professor
Michael Bell, has been working since
lastsng on compiling the oral hisr
tories of Iowa’s Jews. With the help
of interested Grinnell studenm, Griff
has interviewed many Jewish nurs-
ing»home residents and community
members in such cities such as Des
Moines, Council Bluffs and Sioux
City. By asking them questions re-
garding their histories and experi
ences, and recording their answers,
Griff hopes to preserve their heritage
and make it an area of interest to
otlters.

“I want to get students [excited]
about the oral tradition," Griff stated.
As a folklotist and oral historian, she
wants students to “take interest" in
what these people have to say, and
listen to them as young people used
to “listen to the elders" of a commu-
rtity.Bysl'taringtheirwealthofknowl~
edgeandexperience,theolderpeople
teach and the young learn, and a no
dition which might otherwise fade is
kept alive.

The project originated with and is
sponsered by the Jewish Federation
of Iowa, which celebrated its 75th
anniversary a couple years ago, The
TH honored that occasion by contact-
ing Bell and asking him to do re-
search on the subject of J ews in Iowa.
He agreed, and the project was born.

Sincethen,BeIl,theproject’smain
researcher, and Griff, the project’s

director, have spoken with countless
Jewish Iowans about their lives in
this state. Last spring, Griff and 15
students interviewed residents of a
Des Moines nursing home, and Griff
herself has conducted many inter-
views in other cities. Griff and sev—
eral of the students are currently in
the process of transcribing all these
recorded interviews, a daunting
though rewarding task.

Griff stated that nearly all of the
Jews interviewed have had very posi
tive experiences in Iowa. Forthemost
part, they are second generation lowa
Jews,andhavespenttheirentirelives
in this state. Most came not frotn
large metropolitan areas, but from
small, tightly-knit communities, in
which traditions were kept alive and
members kept together, They have
been very successful, they almost
uniformly state, and they have not
had trouble keeping kosher and Sab-
bath laws in an almost exclusively
Christian society.

But for all their positive statements.
Griff wonders if these Jews are not
romanitcizing theirpasts, She related
the story of one man who stated that
it was nice to grow up in lowa. but
who later confessed to having been
assaulted, in his youth, by a group of
boys who were inspired by a church
sermon which had branded the Jews
as “Christ-killers,” The man was not
alone, Griff stated, in giving seem-
ingly contradictory statements such
as these: more than one person inter»
viewed, after giving testimony to all
the positive experiences they have
had,sharednegativcexperienceswith
antieSemitism.

Griff had several ideas to account
for this accentuation of positive expe-
riences, one being the very fact that
these people are Iowans. There is a
“code of politenms," Griff stated,
which seems to govern what the
peoplesay, and this has to dowith the

traditional bias of Midwestemers
against complaining. These people,
Griff explained, insist that Iowa has
treated them well, and that they have
nothing tocomplainabout. Although
anti-Semitism was a major problem
for many of these people, they are
reluctantto say so because thcirovcr-
all experiences have been good. If
there were bad times, Griff stated.
they don’t dwell on it and “they cer—
tainly never harp on it." Like the
tmdttiortal Midwestcmer, Griff said,
they “look forward.”

Griff also credits the process of
assimilation with the positive experir
ences of these Jews, Although they
lived in communities in which their
ttaditions could be kept alive, they
were a generation or two separated
from the larger, more traditional Jew»
tsh communitiesofNewYorkor New
England. In a process Griff described
as being “give and take,“ these Jews
incorporated elements of their sur-
rounding society into their lives and
made them their own, lessening the
gap between the Jewish and Christian
communities For instance, Griffex-
plained, the grandmother of a little
girl who had won a Christmas tree in
acontcstdeemed thetreeai-lanukkah
bush, which shipped the tree of its
Christian connatations and made it
fully Jewish.

In another example of “borrow»
ing,” as Griff called this kind of as—
similation. Griff described a Jewish
cemetery in ntral lowa. Normally,
decoration on Jewish headstones con-
sists only of writing in Hebrew; the
stone is devoid of the carvings, scrolls
and other such ornaments generally
found in Christian cemeteries But in
this cemetery, Griff stated, while the
Hebrew writing was still present on
the stones, they were also decorated
with whatOrthodox Jews would con»
sider Christian symbolism. A stone
shaped like a tree stump, meant to

SCARLET & B LAC K:

Professor Hanna Griff

represent the spirit of one who died
too young, and normally only found
in Christian cemeteries, is found here
in conjunction with the Hebrew.
This “very Midwest" Way of in4
corporating elements of one culture
into another may possibly be due to
ignorance of some Orthodox prac-
tices, Griff conceded. Because Jews
were separated from their traditional
communities, and were surrounded
for their entire lives by another faith
community, they may not even have
known the “traditional” way to do
things, such as construct headstones.
The concerns for Jews in Iowa
today, however, are far beyond those
of headstone construction. As young

people throughout the state venture
out to differentparts of the country in
search of opportunities and jobs,
youngJews arelcaving too,andleav-
ing behind this heritage. What is go
ing to happen next is a “constant
concern,” Griff stated. While the
Jewish tradition in Iowa is certainly
not going to die out, and "there will
always be one to carry on the torch,"
it is important to keep the tradition’s
rich history in mind, and not allow it
lobe lostin today’sworlthisproject -
is “a good document for the present,”
Griff stated: through the words of
“the elders,” it preserves the past and
helps us to realize the future.

Habitat Home Underway

By Alison Wade

Renovations for the first home of
the Poweshiek County chapter of
Habitatforl-lumanity arenearing their
completion, The ﬁnal stages of work
serve as a source of pride and relief
for those who have labored over the
project since last May.

Although the original plan was to
have the house finished by the end of
lastsummer,thedeadline forcomplc~
tion has been extended three times
due to unexpected problems. "Th is is
our first house, so it‘s been pretty
slow,” said project coordinator Anna
Littcn. She continued, “Things just
seem to take longer than we expect."

Although the labor has been com
prised largely of volunteers for du-
ties, Habitat has needed to hire out
skilled labors to deal with many pre
viously unforseen probletns, such as
thoscwhich have occurcd with plumb-
mg,

When completed, the home will
become living area for a small Grin-
nell family whose application for a
home was picked by the Habitat for
Humanity board last spring. “It’s not
afree house, really,”saidLitten.”The
family has to put in volunteer hours,
and. . . beﬁnancially stableenough to
pay back the small mortgage. They
also have to show a commitment to
the community.“

Because the family has been inLir
mately involved with the renovation,
volunteers generally feel more com»
fortable about the extra time that has
been required. “The family is so in
touch with the different components
of the project that they have a really
good sense of what's going on. . . .
They’re probably themostaware that
it’s better to wait and to get it done
right than to hurry it,” said Litten.

The specific details complicating
the project have been a frustration;
however, Littcn claimed that the most
difficult part of the job is simply
“keeping our goals in mind.”

“It’s really important for us to re
memborthat first and f orcmost, we’re
working with families and not just
massproducinghomes.We'reapart»
nership. . . .It’s so much moreiinpor»
tant to work with people titan to work
with houses," she stud.

Although uncertain about the spe-
cific projects which will follow the
renovationof this home, Habitatwork~
crs remain optimistic. Littcn rcr
marked, “We’ve learneda lot. . .about
what we’ve done wrong and what
we’ve done right. Now we‘rcrestruc-
turing many fundamental aspects of
the way we work, and I’m really
optimistic about our future.”

Students are encouraged to con-
tact Litten or the CSC about helping
withthishomeorwithfutureprojects.
