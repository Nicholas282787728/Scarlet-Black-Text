R008 Run Mississippi

By Gerald I-lontgstock

Creditlsland, in the middle of the
Mississippi River, was the setting
for the Augustana Invitational last
Saturday With many of the Roos
taking a well»deserved break from
racing, a very mixed team ran the
flat, ﬁve-mile course.

Gaining valuablerace experience,
Jonathan Lave ran a very respect~
able 25:50 and finished 5th overall.
MikeIennings(35th)ranmostofthe
way with Nick Hopley (45th), while
Dave Sheridan (67th) paced Dave
Peterson (66th), who has overcome
his injuriestomakehis presence felt.
Brett Kelver again had a suong per-
forrnanoe.asdidPeteInsel,Joe Hart.
and Adam Stam.

On a humorous note, for a time
Dominador Gobaleza ran side by
side with Dave Terronez, Augus-

tana‘s best runner and winner of
Division III Nationals last year —
but only because portions of the
course wererepeated during the mce.

Grinnell finished in a surprise-tie
for 5th with Bradley at 143 points.
Augustana. with 34 points, narrowly
beat Luther, 42 points, and Illinois
Wesleyan, 84, was far ahead of
Simpson, 110.

The Roos finished ahead of
Dubuque and William Penn.

Today the top eightRoos are back
in action at Notre Dame for a very
high-caliber meet. while the remain»
ing Roos travel to Luther tomorrow
with the Skull Cmshers for the State
Meet

Both squads said they are excited
about the meets this weekend and
look forward to giving other schools
the chartce to ask, “Where the hell is
Grinnell?"

 

 

Grinnell Football Loses Heartbreaker
at Lawrence; Next Comes Coe College

By Steve Clem
and Mick Kulikowski

The Pioneers rolled into Wisconr
sin to take on Lawrence last Saturr
day, expecting to come out victorie
ous over a team that was clearly
struggling. Grinnell emerged with a

statistical triumph, but without a.

victory.

In absorbing the 21-18 defeat, the
Pioneers stand at the .500 mark, with
a record of 2-2 (0-1 in conference
play)

The game was one that the Pier
neers truly thought they should have
won. The statistics support this the
ory.

Grinnell had 15 first downs to
Lawrence’s 12. The men in scarlet
and black compiled 231 yards in the
afternoon compared to Lawrence’s

The DePaul University

190 yards.

Also, the Pioneer defense forced
the opposition to punt 7 times in the
game. Both teams turned the ball
over 3 times; but when Grinnell lost
possession of the pigskin, Lawrence
was quick to take advantage.

Grinnell trailed 1370 in the second
quarter after two Lawrence field
goals and a short touchdown pass,
butthe Pioneers closed the gap to 10
points after a 32-yard field goal by
Mike Mohan.

Special teams continued to shine
in the second half as freshman de~
fensive back Herman Barber, using
a few moves that would make Deion
Sanders proud, juked his way 41
yards for a touchdown. Atthe end of
threequanersofplayﬁrinnelltrailed
13-10.

Lady Luck was not with the Pier
neers in Appleton, however. Law—

rence scored a touchdown and a
safetyinthefourthquartertomakeit
a 10»point deficit for the Pioneers.

The team showed iLS courage by
refusing to quit. Grinnell capped a
97vyard drive with a two~yard score
ing pass from quarterback Dave
White to runningback Ted Stanley.
Stanley continues to be a scoring
Lhreat,netting his fifthtouchdownin
four games.

The 2»point conversion attempt

A tough loss, indeed.

Tomorrow, the Pioneers hope to
