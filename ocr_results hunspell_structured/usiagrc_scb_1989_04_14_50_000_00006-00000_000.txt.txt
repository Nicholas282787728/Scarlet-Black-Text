New policy is no solution

President George Drake seriously erred when he overruled a policy
that would have given same-sex married couples the right to move off
campus, a right that was previously held only by heterosexual married
couples. instead of taking a bold stand that would have put Grinnell
College in the forefront of the effort to recognize gay rights, Drake
dodged the main issue by formulating a decision that hurts all married
student couples.

Drake argued that the proposed Committee on Student Life (CSL)
policy would adversely affect residential life at Grinnell. He said that if
the proposal were adopted, students might be able to take advantage of
the alleged precedent to move off catnpus for reasons other than tltose
already established.

That Drake interprets the policy change as such a precedent, rather
than as a confirmation of existing rights guaranteed by the college‘s
non-discrimination policy. demonstrates that he does not fully under-
stand the situation. i-lis repense detracts attention from the real issue.
that of a legitimate claim for equal treatment for gays and lesbians.

The housing-policy proposal passed by CSL and Joint Board adheres
to the spirit of the college's non-discrimination policy. Rather than
accepting this proposal, Drake chose a solution which. although com-
patible with the letter of the non-discrimination policy, clearly violates
its spirit

Drake has argued that the new policy treats all married couples
equally and therefore does not violate the non- discrimination policy
The history of exemptions to the on-campus living requirement, how-
ever, indicates that the move does anything but promote equality. Sev-
eral years ago the administration allowed a heterosexual, married fresh-
man couple to live in non-college housing, There were no claims that
the action would harm the quality of residential life at Grinnell. it is
clear that the administration saw something wrong, or at least irregular,
with same~sex underclass married couples living off campus.

In addition to damaging gay and lesbian rights, Drake‘s new policy
hurts campus diversity. A freshman who does not have a child. who is
under 22, and who is married to a non-student tnust live separately from
his or her spouse, At best. the student would have to pay room and
board while living off campus in order to stay with his or her spouse.
Any young couple would think twice before coming to a school that
would force them to live separately.

Drake had an excellent opportunity to show his commitment to gay
and lesbian rights. It is ironic that on the eve of Gay and Lesbian Pride
Week. he ltas provided vivid proof that anti-gay discrimination is still
prominent in our society. even on a campus which, according to its
non-discrimination policy, prides itselfon the acceptance of people re-
gardless of “sex, race. color. creed, national or ethnic origin, handicap.
or sexual or affectionai preference,"

Decide OCNCO slots earlier

This year the deadline for applying to live in off-campus non-col-
lege-owned housing was March 3. However, next year's seniors were
not notified until April 3 that they could live off campus. while
incoming juniors had to wait until the April 6 OCNCO number draw to
know if they would receive official permission April is simply too
late in the year to start a search for housing. To furtlter the difficulties
for thejuniors who did receive approval, they had to decide by April 13
whether to live off campus. if they followed the advice ofStudcnt Af-
fairs and did not sign a lease until given permission, they had only a
week to make off-campus living arrangements.

The problem is compounded by the fact that, until OCNCO number
draw, next year's juniors cannot assume that they will be allowed to
live off campus. One hundred anti seventy five students applied for the
150 off-campus slots for the entire 1989-1990 academic year. Thirty-
eigltt students applied to live in non-college housing for the Spring
semester only. Last week Student Affairs denied approximately 25 ju-
niors permission to live in OCNCO housing. According to Diane
Dougherty. director of student housing, at least one of the juniors who
was rejected had already signed a lease.

Signing a lease in early March is sometimes necessary in order to
secure inexpensive off-campus housing. Students who wait until Sta-
dent Affairs gives final approval risk being limited to expensive or in-
adequate housing options.

Daugherty said the reason for the late decision dates is to allow stu—
dents who are studying abroad to be part of tlte number-draw systcm.
but she suggested a solution that would stltisly the needs of students
both on and off campus. Students on academic lcttvc should decide [VC-
forc leaving the country wltctltcr lhcy wont to live off campus Under
this system, Student Affairs could hold number druw much cttrlicr. lu-
niors might still have to tttkc their chances at OCNCO number draw,
but ttt least they would know if they had approval to live in OCNCO
housing before they had to sign a lo. tsc

Cooley and others call for
Drake to reverse decision

To the editor:

Over the past few months a
group of students has been work-
mg to bring Grinnell College's
housing policy forward to a non-
discriminatory position The
portion of the housing policy for
this year which describes the cir-
cumstances under which freshmen
and sophomores can move to

against same-sex couples.

will legally recognize same-sex
marriages. this policy was inher-
cntly discriminatory. The clause
extended that right to heterosex-
ual couples only.

After this problem had been
brought to the attention of the
administration, CSL [Committee
on Student Life]. at the request of
the Joint Board representative,
drafted a proposed addition to the
housinnglicy. This change was

“in addition, until iowa
recognizes salrte~sex mar-
riages, Grinnell College
will recognize institutional-
ly sanctioned marriages of
same-sex couples."

During spring vacation.
George Drake, Waldo Walker, and

Tom Cratly vetoed this proposal.
in addition to this decision. they
attempted to rid the housing pol-
icy of discrimination by forming
a new one under which legally
married freshman and sophomore
students would no longer be able
to move off campus unless they
were over 22 or had a child.

Their stated reasons for this
decision were: they did not want
to make a political statement in
the housing policy (that was al-
ready done in the non-discrimina-
tion policy). they thought that
the proposed change would be
discriminatory against heterosex-
ual couples who could not get
married. and they feared that this
change would “open the door to
vast numbers of students asking
for s ecial consideration in hous-
ing or one reason or another.”

tial atmosphere of Grinnell.

Student criticizes policy

To the editor:

This letter concerns the new
change in housing policy, this
being that first-year students and
sophomores can no longer live in
off~campus non-college-owned
housing unless they are over the
age of 22 or have children. This
policy change was made in re-
sponse to the new situation of
committed SavaScX couples liv-
ing off campus before theirjunior
year.

instead of dealing with this
new situation in a sensitive. cre-
ative way, the administration has
apparently chosen to circumvent
the issue entirely by forcing an
unreasonable policy on everyone.
This makes me personally both
angry and sad. It makes me an»
gry that the interests of the stu-
dent(s) involved are being ignored
because the college administra-
tion cannot be bothered with the
“problem." And in doing so, they
have also penalized every other
potential or present first-year
student or sophomore because
they choose not to deal with the
situation. By doing this they
ltave sent a message to everyone
on this campus that gays and
lesbians don’t matter. that this
college will not deal with issues
unique to their life experience.
because it is not worth the lrou~
hie.

it makes tue sad, especially
for Grinnell, because of what this
policy change represents in the
larger sense, This college has
not always followed the letter of
the law; there have been limes
when Grinncil has realized that
the law vi ‘wrong and chose to
he run: l)‘ tilitwt than legally
correct (education of Ai‘rorAmertA

cans in the 1800s is an example).
Yet, in this case. the college is
clinging doggedly, not even to
the law itself. but to the
implications of that law. With a
prime opportunity to take one
step forward in establishing free-
dom for one group. lesbians and
gays. the college has instead
taken two steps backwards in

the “legally married" clause
would be open to heterosexuals
and the new clause to same sex
couples. They would be two
separate categories. Getting

married in laws is quite easy,
easier. in fact, than getting
“institutionally sanctioned." Ob<
taining a marriage license takes
$15 and a three-day waiting pc-
riod. A church wedding costs at
least $200 and a month of plan-
ning. As to opening the door to
other “exceptions," this change is
one which is easily defensible and
has sound reasons behind it. The
administration should be capable
of judging future cases as they
arise.

We believe that this is an is-
sue which the collegc has chosen
to avoid rather than face. Their
decision was reactionary and
backwards. it violated everything
that the non-discr’tnirntion pol-
icy is supposcd to stand for.
Rather than great r ghts to same-
sex couples in order to achieve a
degree of equality, they choose to
take those rights away from the
people who already had them.
We strongly urge the administra-
tion to reverse their decision and
approve the policy which was
drafted by CSL. Melanie
