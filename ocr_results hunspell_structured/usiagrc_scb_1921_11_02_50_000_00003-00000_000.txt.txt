Dr. Steiner Tells of
Life Valuesyin Chapel

”Is Life Really Worth While?" was
the Lhesis of Dl‘. Edward A. Steiner's
talk in chapel Wednesday morning.
"15 Joy Greater Than Sorrow, and thc
Permanent stronger- Than the Fleet-
iugl", is a question which one asks
as he watches the round oi lite—the
wheel which turns, and from which
there is no escape. \

“Life is worth’ living,"‘ said Dr.
steiner. "it you have lived a joyous
unconscious physical life, unha'ndicap»
red by bad habits, and have enioyed
good health? And What joy it is to
have read good books, to have been
all lovely and noble things, To have
seen great pictures, like the Sistine
Madonna, is worth while, To have
lived on a. high mental plane, appre-
ciating What you cannot create is J'OY.

made hundreds of

lrving nobly by their nobility,
worth while. The slowest and great—
est and ripest joy in life is to know
God—to know Him by wallring alter
Him in nature, in science, in the lives
oi poor men, and in suiicring.
lnsﬂy, a futile thing to say to boys
and girls, it you seelr cod, and if you
be a pilgrim, ye shall live.”
