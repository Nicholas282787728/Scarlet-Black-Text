to reiterate what has been so i|e~
quently said, The Thanksgiving
recess is not a vacation, but a
mere breathtngspell, an easing on
from the brealtencclt pace, that

mission granted anyone to leave
for home before the recitations of
Wednesday are over, and that all
are expected to be ready tor node
at eight o'clock on the Monday
following, This last statement
should be Strongly emphasized,
because at the special importance
ascribed by the faculty to the ﬁrst
recitation after the recess.
