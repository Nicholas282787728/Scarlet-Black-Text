International mime woos old ladies

JASON CARPP

av ABBV RAPOPORT

Jason carpp is a performer,
He can even tap—dance while
huteheiing crabs. in fact, durs
ing the year he took off from
Crlnnell, he worked part—time
butchering crabs in a Malaysian
restaurant in Australia. The tape
dancing he learned as a child and
used to pass the time.

“It was a horrible job hut 1
loved it,” said Carpp, looking
hack on the experience. But
taptdancing was not die only
pcrformnuve element of his job,
Because the workers were from
all over the world, the lack of a
common language pushed carpp
to improve his miming abilities.

“When you're in that kind
of community where there's no
common language, things are rev
ally funny," he said.

The Iowa native has been
pursuing opportunities to per»
form since he was young, As a
child, he remembers his fam-
ily egging him on to do imprese
sions ofothers. His favorite part
of dance classes was always the
performance, “The thing that
was fun was making goofy faces
and getting old ladies to swan,"
he said.

Carpp does not hmit himself,
but instead dabbles in anything
and everything that catches his
attention. “I had diverse inter
ests and 1 thought that was a had
thing for a long time," he said.
“But ultimately you can't defeat
your own nature."

And Carpp has not tried to
defeat his nature. Since coming
to Grinnell, he's been in acting
and improv troupes, hands, and
dance groups.

For instance he was a found-
ing member of the Silly Do
Nothing Players, a four-person
acting group that produced 77}:
Bald Soprano (and has since dis—
appeared). In addition to this
student group, he also has per
formed in two Main stage plays
(Petr/mil and Frame: q/tb: Skull)
and one Grinnell independent
Theatre production (Waitittgﬂtt
Collar),

The Silly Do Nothing Players
is just one example ofhow Carpp
readily folms groups and pursues
his interests, even if he does not
intend to maintain them forever.
l-lis freshman year, he started a

hand, The Casual Six, with ﬁve
others. He played hass most of
the time, except when the hand
attempted to feature Carpp’s taps
dancing as percussion.

“It didn't really come across
well," he said. “It was a little
ambitious."l3ut it did give him
a chance to
dance, an-
other skill ho
seeks. He
has worked
consistently
with the Dance Troupe and this
semester, he took Javanese danc-
ing. At the class’s performance,
Carpp performed a mask solo as
the gagrzlr, the role of the strong
male.Despite this title, Carpp

as such. “I tried rughy l was

orall these groups and clubs,
he has not been in any one for all
four years at Grinnell. “There's
heen common threads though,”
he said.

he had decided this would he a
good idea, answered easily. “It’ll
make another inrcresting story to
put under [my] bolt,"he stud.

But for the moment, his
main goal is to learn capoeira, an
AfrosBraeilian method of fight-
ing that ' valves singing, donor
ing and martial arts. In trying to
explain what draws him to it, he
said, “I try to struggle against the
limited constraints of my inﬂex-
ihility. That's what we do men
tally here . Bur maybe I’m just
a hyper-active kid who can’t sit
still, That’s probably the greater
truth."
