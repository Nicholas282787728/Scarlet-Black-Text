We walked into the empty the«
ater for the showing of Black Sheep
and loudly exclaimed that it would
be yet another opportunity to take
off our shirts. Then we realized that
there were two iootballplayers belch
mg loudly in the shadows. Thls little
vignette pretty much sums up the
movie’s plot, Chris Farley (otsiitiir—
day Night Live tame, and a former
football player to boot) plays a Roger
Clintonesque “black sheep” of the
family who is about to kill, with his
good intentions, his brother's hopes
(or governor David spade (also or
SM.) plays the guy who is sent to
keep Farley out ottrouble, Use your
imagination and youi knowledge of
every SNL joke you’ve seen in the
past few years, and you can predict
ivhar happens in this moVie. Part of
the reason for this phenomenon is
that Black Sheep was directed by
Penelope sphceris (director of
Wayne's World) and produced by
Lorne Michaela (producer ofSNL).

\Ve refused to watch all of the
hype (or this movie on MTV. How—
ever, MTV hype is inescapable in

“Rock the Vote” (in iihich Mud»
honey makes a guest appearance).
We felt our Gnnnellian indivrtlual—
ism slowly ebbing away with every
rum of the reel. Gaspl We were
being exposed to pop culturel

Probably the most entertain—
ing and bizarre aspectof this movie is
its true»to«llfe portrayal of Iowa life,
even though it's set near Seattle,
Washington. Incidents such as [own—
ie car jacks, bat attacks (Quad any
one?) and the penchant ofGnnnel—

the slightest provocation are espe»
Clally realistic. Liltc Ace Ventiira.
this movie lS best ifscrved with wine:
we recommend a nice Zinfandel. Too
bad the football players didn’t offer
us any beer. ,.
