Since the state meet has been
put off there is another oppor-
tunity tor the dope ﬁend to pick
the winner of the coming contest.
The meet is as much in doubt as
it has ever been and Iowa, Drake
and Anies are picked by different
persons to carry on the ﬁrst place,
Following are the best records
made thisyear:

100 yard dash—Busby,
:10 1-5.

220 yard dasheAnderson, (1.),
:23.

440 yard dashePanton, (Norr

Half mile relay—Iowa, i:33 375.

Mile relainrinnell, 4:39 475.

Every event in the meet prom.
ises to be close. In the 100 there
is Young of Drake with a record
of 10 sec,Busby of Ames,Scarr of
Iowa, still undefeated this year,
White of Iowa and Bairot Grin-
nell. The points in the event
will probably go to White, Scarr
and Busby, and these men will
probably take the places in the
220.

in the 440 Main or Drake is the
favorite with Cave of Ames, Evans
of Grinnell, and Panton and
Hamilton 05 Normal are well up in
the bunch. The half mile lies
between Campbell of Normal,
Miller of Cornell, and VVelker of
Grinnell. The mile will go to

. Coates ofAmes, with Campbell of
Normal a probable second, while
third may go to Batman ot lowa,

(1%.).

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL

Thompson or laggard ot Drake,
ol' Pringlc of Grinnell. Thompson
of Drake is a sure winner when in
good condition, but his varicose
veins makehim an unknown quant-
ity at present. Coates will also win
thc2 mile, and second is a toss up
between Hands of loiva, Jaggard
and Sleeper ot' Drake and MC»
Ilrath oi Grinnell.

Drake will taite tivo places in
the pole vault with Chapman and
Burcham and third may go to
Simpson, Ames or Iowa. Wall
of Drake will be pushed by Barker
and Parsons of Iowa in the high
jump, Ross of Iowa is in a class
by himself in the broad andshould
win the event with ease, The re
maining places will be tought for
by Packer and Heisy of Ames,
Barnes of Drake, Bair of Grinnell.
and Parsons of Iowa.

The high hurdles will be one of
the closest events otthe day, with
Chapman a slight tavorite and
Bair and Anderson running close.
The captains of Drake, Iowa and
Grinnell will meet in this event.
Main of Drake and Anderson of
Iowa have done the best work
this year in the low hurdles,
though Clow and Bair 0t Grins
nel] or Kemptof Ames may make
a strong bid for ﬁrst.

or the weights the hammer
should go to Jorgenson and Wil.
llams of Ames,

Drake. thil' .

petition for ﬁrst in the discuss,
but Walters of Drake,and Cave of
Ames, will be close together tor
second and third. The shot
should go to Crane of lowa,
though Walters or Drake may win
the event.

The course tor the halt mile
relay will be taped and this event
will be one of the prettiest ot the
day. 1owa should win with Ames
second and Grinnell third. The
mile relay isdoubttul. Both Grin—
nell and Drake have fast teams
and Ames may run a close race
with the leaders.

It Drake winsthe meet she will
gain possesssion or the cup by a

third consecutive victory. Early
in the season her prospects were
very bright, but hard luck has de-
prived her of sure points in
Thompson and at present Iowa
seems to have the best prospect

rot winning the meet.
