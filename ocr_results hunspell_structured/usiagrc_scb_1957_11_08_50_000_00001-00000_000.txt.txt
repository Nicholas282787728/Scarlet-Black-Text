College Raises Tuition By $100
To Meet Rising Operating Costs

'In View of the $100 tuition increase for,1958—59 re-
cently announced in a letter from President Howard R.
Bowen to all students and their parents, questions have
naturally arisen as to the necessity of the increase and how
Gl‘innell costs compare with those of other colleges.

The total increased cost is $1,650, but extra charges
such as laboratory, practice teaching, diploma fees and the

$20 per hour charge for taking
more than 17 credit hours have
been eliminated.

Bowen‘s letter stated that the
increase was necessary "to fi-
nance essential salary increases
for the faculty and staff." He
also‘cited higher operating costs
as a reason for the tuition boost.

In the other Midwest ooii-
ferenee colleges (Carleton, Coe,
Cornell, Knox, Lawrence,
Monmouth, itipon, and st.
Olaf), all but two raised tui-
tion or ,other charges this
year. Including Grinnell‘ six
of the nine colleges will iii-
crease ohargts next year.
The figure charged by Grin-
nell is in some cases slightly
higher than the other colleges,
but many of the other college
catalogs list special fees, enter-
tainment expenses and fra—
ternity fees, which are not in-
cluded in their over—all costs.
“Many students and their
parents do not realize how
much the cost of operating
Grinnell exceeds the charges
they are asked to pay." stated
Bowen. in i956-57 the college
spent $2,360 per student to pro—
vide instruction, board, room
and other services, compared
with the charge of $1,550, This
means that each student re-
ceived an automatic subsidy of
$810.

Deducting the amount of
scholarships and other aid
awarded, the college actually re—
ceived only 54% of the total
cost of operating the college.
The balance. nearly $1 million,
was provided by gifts, endow~
ment income. and income of
auxiliary enterprises.

The findings of President
Eisenhower's committee on
education beyond high school
were the subject of a recent
article in the' Des Moines Reg-
ister. The chairman of the
committee reported that it
was “impossible to maintain
adequate facilities without
more financial support from
pal-en “

“At best,” the committee
stated, “students pay 50% of
their college costs. In public in—
stitutions, it is less than 20%.”
it also stated that the nation
spends $3 billion a year for
higher education and that this
amount Will have to double by
1970.
