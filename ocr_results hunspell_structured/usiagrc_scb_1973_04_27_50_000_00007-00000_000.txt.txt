In recent weeks, auto manuiactur—
ers intensified their lobbying shorts
to delay pollution reductions requir—
ed on 1975 vehicles under the 1970
Clean Air Act. In newspapers across
the country recent reports have
come out warning against “the press
pect oi an unreasonable risk oihus-
iness catastrophe and massive dif—
iiculties with these Vehicles in tile
hands or the public.”

Top Nixon aide John Ehrlichman
has indicated that the White House
may side with the auto companies
in this ﬁght, and the Environmental
Protection Agency opened new
court—ordered hearings on thedead»

The position oi the White House
is especially discouraging in light oi

General Motors, testiiying beIore

disputes the argument oi some auto
and petroleum companies that new

Even though their report showed
that the catalyst systems could ac-
hieve better gas consumption rates
than those oi this years new cars,
General Motors has continued tear»
gue {or a delay.

In view oi these renewed hearings
it is encouraging to note that the
EPA has announced that it would
soon issue land-use regulations to
restrict construction that stimulates
increased carsexhaust pollution,
Regulations will require each state
to review the location of facilities
‘such as shopping centers, sports
complexes, drivesln theaters,park—
ing lots and garages, and residen-
tial, commercial, or institutional
developments that “may cause an
increase in air pollution because
of associated activities,”

The EPA was taken to task, th-
ough, in a letter from Sierra
Club Executive Director Michael
McClOskey, who pointed out that the
EPA's proposed regulations tor lead

additives in gasoline weaken earlier
proposals by extending the phased
reduction of lead for an additional
year--until i978—-and by substitu-
ting “average” for “maximum” in
defining how much lead should be
allowed per gallon ol gasoline.
MCCloskey wrote that “It is the
carefully considered opinion of the
Sierra Club that exposures to air-
borne lead are preventable through
the elimination of lead additives
in gasoline and that no substantive
technical or economic reasons exi-
st for not promulgating a regula-
tion to this enact.”
