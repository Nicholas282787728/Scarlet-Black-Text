ETTEBS TO THE EDITOR

I ormer Photo Editors
I-last Cyclone's Ison

o the editor,

Most of you have by now seen

riting to correct a serious error
which was made by the Editor in

133. Ison apologizes for the blank
-ages and blames some of the
. sociate editors for the problem.
WebelievethatMichaelG. Ison,
as editor in chief. is ultimately
responsiblefordleblankpages.and
he is misrepresenting the situation
by passing the blame onto his staff.
Ison's letter states, we did have
a young staff many of whom were
new to the school. In order to
publish a book with an
inexperienced staff. a strong,
competent leader is essential. Ison

did not provide this leadership.

Virtually nothing got
accomplished on the yearbook
during the ﬁrst semester. As photo
editors, we repeatedly asked which
speciﬁc campus events needed to
be covered. but we were never told.
Finally, we simply covered events
which seemed important to us.
Although this was not the most
efﬁcient way to do things, at least
something was getting done. Once
the photos were taken, we asked
which ones needed lobe printed for
inclusion in the yearbook. Again
we were not told, so again, we
printed what wetheught should be
included. Thephotostal’fwas acting
independently, since Ison was not
telling us or any of the editors what
needed to be done.

The blank pages were to be

completed by one of the associate
editors immediatelyafler the school
year was over. Ison did not provide
this editor wiut all the equipment
necessary to complete thcjob. The
first time Ison heard that there was
a problem with the book was when
the printing company called him
after the ﬁnal deadline had passed,
asking aboutthe missing pages. As
there had been problems meeting
deadlines throughout the year. Why
wasn't Ison making sure the book
was getting completed on time?

In short, we believe Michael G.
Ison’s name should appear at the
bottom of every blank page. as it
appears sooftcn lhroughoutthc rest
of the book.

Students Decry Poor Quality of Book

0 the editor,

We recently looked through the
atest evidence of Grinnell‘s de~
‘lining standards. The 1990

yclone speaks for itself. It ls rer
rlete with spelling errors, sentence

aws so numerous that merely
ounting them would be a formir
r ble task. It is not clear to us how
publication which is compiled
Iver the course'of a full year by a
; cup of the nation's best under-
raduates reached its ﬁnal form
ilhout even being put through a
pen-cheek program. However. it
s clear that we could not display
. is Cyclone with pride as the sym-
rolofoutyearsatoneofthenalion‘s
op liberal arts colleges.
Unfortunately, the flaws of this
ublication extend beyond mere
technical details. The lack of an
index combined Willi the fact that
most candid pictures have no cap-
ions makes this yearbook

”...it is clear that we
could not display this

Cyclone with pride..."
Paul Marker &
Joel Krueger

unsuitable for the very purpose [or
which it is intended. Imagine at-
tempting to put names with faces
20 years from now without the ben-
efit of an index or captions (one
friend suggested that this is merely
a do—lt—yoursclf Cyclone i.e. lots of
space to paste your own pictures
and add your own captions).
Beyond the obvious structural
flaws, there are also philosophical
flaws with this publication. The
imposition of one set or religious
beliefsiwe'rc referring to the
omission of the letter “o" in the
word God—on the personal quotes
of the members of a diverse com—
munity comprised of individuals

with disparate religious beliefs is
completely inappropriate. Italmost
necdnotbesaitl lhatacon-scrvative
Muslim or Christian might take
offenscutthcprojeclion ofalewish
value system on their words,

We dott’tknow who is immedir
alely responsible for the problems
with the Cyclone; however, the tile
limate blame tnust be placed on the
editor in chief. The editor in chlef
for the 1990 Cyclone was a ﬁrst
year student who has continued as
editorinchiefforthe ncxl Cyclone.
GiVCn this fact, there is u clear (illllr
ger that the ﬁasco oi the current
publication will be repealed. We at
Grinnell are notorious for our pre»
dtlection for student self-
govcmancc; nevertheless. the 1990
Cyclone clearly demonstrates the
need tor l or tttculty supervision
over acl‘ cs such as the produc-
tion of the Cyclone.

Student Criticizes

Errors in ”Pathetic"
1990 Cyclone

To the editor,

AllerpayingSZOlXMorthci990
Cyclone, I was eager, at first, to
justify my purchase by defending
Michael G. Ison and the rest of thc
Cyclone stall. Ison became editor
rclativelylatc in the year, tltcrewcre
staff problems, the blank pages
weren’t his fault, CLC,CIC, etc. Yet
even when '

m i t i g a t i n g
circumstances
are taken into
consideration,
any yearbook
which misspclls
the name of the
college it
r e p r c s c n l s
deserves some
scriouscriticism.

The faculty
5 u p p l e m e n t
alone, in a mere 15 pages,conlains
at least48 technical errors. Words
aremisspelled; Ihcpeopleshownin
photographs do not correspond to
the people actually listed in the
captions; in one instance '4 row of
XXXXXX's takes the place of the
name ofan art faculty member; the
Russian and Religious Studies
photographs are switched; and the
American Studies, Philosophy and
Psychology departments are not
shown at all. Only one page, page
6, is without error.

These are merely technical
errors. Ison's blissfully inane
commentaries on the VAX cluSlCl’,
the AV centcr,Burling,thc Writing
Lab, Off~Calttpus Studies and Lane
guagc Tables matches the quality
of his spelling. Somc samples of
Ison's ptthy prose: “On [sic] olthe
most popular places on campus is
Burling Library. On [sic] of the
reason [sic] why the library is so
popular is that it is considered by
many to he the most comfortable
library in the country.” Atld about
ctr-Campusstudics; “Ilisawcllr
know [sic] fact that Lhc best way of
leamingaboutaplace ls logo there.
Well, alGrinncll, lhalls very much

some
criticism."

the case. The Off-Campus Studies
Program at Grinnell College is
fabulousbrcauscltlelsyoudostudy
in almost any regton of the world
studying almost anydting that you
want to study." Ison would have
done well to have followed his own
advice and taken the yearbook to
lhc’highlyrprltiscrl Writing Lab,
“one of the greatest places to go
when you are
havingproblcms
