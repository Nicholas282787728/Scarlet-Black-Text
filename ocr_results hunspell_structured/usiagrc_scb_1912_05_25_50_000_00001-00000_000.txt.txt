uses Excellently — Mr. Connell
Sings Part of Elijah WelliAft-
emoon Program Proves Popular

The long’expected and carefully pres
pared tor May Festival came to an
end Thursday evening with the ﬁnal
chorus of the Oratorio "Elijah.” In
many respects this has been the most
suctesslul and satisfeing of the seven
festivals which have been held in Grin-
nell. The soloists were unusually good
—in fact, the best which have ever
been here with the lllnneapalis Ol'cllesV
tra; and while the Orchestra itselt
perhaps did not play with quite the
ﬁnish 05 ioriner years, it put on a kind
and duality of music especially pleas
in; to a Griiiiiell audience.

souri Valley Contest‘Harrison
Does Effective Work.

J, G. Emerson, oi Allies, captured
ﬁrst plate in the ﬁrst annual Missouri
Valley oi-atorical contest at Des Monies
last night. The Aggie orator who has
already taken ﬁrst honors in the state
contest as well as the interstate can-
test, gave a poweriul speech on “Amer-
ica and the Peace Problem in the oi-
ent." J. David Arnold, ot Draite Uni~
versi , closely rivniled the Alnes man,
and won second place.

1i, Clinton Harrison, Grinnell‘s rep»
i-esentative, was greatly handicapped
by being the ﬁrst speaker on the mo
gram and also having to stop on ac
count or the lateness ot a judge. Mr.
Harrison vigorously and oticttively at-
tached the idea at voting the straight
party ticket without regard to issues,
in an oration entitled “Party Loyalty."

Indianola Team Defeats Scarlet
and Black Folks in Good Con-
tesFCostly Errors Made—Scor-
ing Done Early.

In a tightly played game Grinnell
lost to Simpson yesterday by the score
of 2 to 1. Anderson pitched a good
game, as did Corbin for the Simpson
ites. A tew costly errors, a tw rbase
hit by Corbin brought in the winning
run in the third inning.

The ﬁelding proclivities oi the Silllllr
sonians robbed the Grinneli warriors
of several him—lies that looked good ior
hits. The Simpson outﬁelder: were
on the job all the time and gathered
everything in sight.

The scoring was done early in the
some. Each team sent a man around in
the second and in the third Simpson
scored the winning run. The vacillat-
iiig decisions of tile umpire marred the
game. The wot-thy oiiicial “as unr
