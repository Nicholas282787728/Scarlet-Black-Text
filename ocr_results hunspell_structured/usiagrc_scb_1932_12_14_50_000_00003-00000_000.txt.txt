Scientists Find Radium
Capsule in Ash Heap

AUSTIN. Tex., (CNS)7How scir
ence found a $3000 bit of radium that
had gone through an incinerator fire
this week was described by Prof. S.
L. Brohn of the University of Texas
physics department.

The tiny capsule of radium, b:
longing to Dr, Dudley Jackson of
San Antonio, had been accidentally
thrown into a wastebasket and car
ried to the incinerator. Employees of
an insurance firm sifted two tons of
ashes, but failed to find the tube.

Meanwhile. a call had been put in
for Professor Brown, who arrived
with his assistant, H. E. Lockenvitz,
a physics instructor. Using an electro-
scope, they found the radium within
a few minutes—none the worse for
the fire.

This is the second time within the
past year that professors of the uni-
versity have been instrumental in
finding lost tubes of radium, Several
months ago, J. M. Ktlehne of the
physics department was asked to as-
sist in a similar case and succeeded
in finding the missing radium, also
with the aid of an elcctrosoope.
