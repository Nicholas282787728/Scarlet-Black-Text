All gussied up with nowhere to go—except for Waltz

Two underdressed students turn to Abby for Waltz advice, but be prepared for conflict at the cheesecake bar Saturday

Oh Hott, you foxy thing. Undoubt-
edly. After all, what is Waltz but a dif-

ferent kind of Fetish.> Clenlrdge, ties and

heels belong at both (even if the ties are

used a bit differently). Read Judith Butler—it‘s all performa-
tive anyway,

But ifyou are going to do it, do it right. Feel free to go the
dessert bars across campus, but don't wait in line. Go to the cen-
ter ofthe table and take your food, ignoring the open mouths of
those wellebchavcd Grinnellians who waited in line. The awk—
ward ones will scare best. Walk around the South Lounge,and

gaze it people with un ulr ofstudicd superiority, but be careful
not to fall on the icy stulrs outside the Forumirlothillg looks
as dumb as a patent plenthcr corset sliding across the sideunllt.
Consider bringing your partner in
handcuffsiat lcilst you’d both full «)7
gcthcr. Walk around and command
people to dance in different styles, using
a whip to ernpltnsiee your point. Make
people do the electric slide or the hustle
when they fail to do your bidding. After
all, humiliation is in some way connected
to all this.Then you muy consider shouting, "Dance, slaves!”
Depending on your race, however, this may not be advis-
able. Let's make sure dominatrix doesn't trunslatc into Creepy
Racist.
You should strut in there, brimming with conﬁdence, he-
enuse a whip is nothing to sneeze at although laughing at it
nruy be it different matter.

[02 and Ohama face off

I postered as leader ufGrinnellians for Biden
to let students know that Biden was coming to
campus on Monday I noticed that Obnrna’s vol-
unteers had already postered for Tuesday’s rally.
I respected their right to poster, and left their
posters where they were and put my posters in
other spaces. When 1 got to class Monday, all of
my posters were gone, and Ohurns‘i's posters re~
placed them. Not only that, but during our event
someone was standing outside handing out ﬂy»
ers. Why {are you afraid ofBiden? Have you seen
the polls? Why inc you undercutting the under-
dog? You say he doesn’t have a chance, and yet,
you try to undermine his event by advertising
yours? Well, guess what, the US. has started to
pay attention, and when they pay attention, they
vote for Biden. Look at the polls after the last
debate. Maybe you should he scurcd hut you
should still he respectﬁll.

Swenting: Don’t go,

Kiddingl Seriously though, you may consider standing in
a corner.

Kidding againl Oh Swearing, loosen up. Go hung out with
the Orcllestl'ﬂ. since intergenemtional band nerds stick together.
Or spend the evening with your mouth full oflittlc cheesecake
squares~ifyou keep your mouth full, you can't say anything
awkward.

Alternativelyiiye next to someone you think is cool. A sime
pie trick to not looking like total idiot: Dance rest to the slow
songs. Since you can't do slow, maybe you cnn pull ort“ironrc."
see, Sweating? There's hope for you. But ityou see a domina-
trix,I advise you to hide.

I wish talkers were as brief She’s hating on the haters

(this goes for hurling is well),
Please shut up.

As dictated to Christina Reynlds:

“People are going to egg my room. Oh,1’m
going to sound like a tool.

But for the love of G‘d, lay of the dining hall
for one week. Is thut too much to Lisle There’s got
to be something more genuinely troubling than
rye bread and pineapple—upside-down cake.

I‘m not saying the stir fry isn‘t utterly disap-
pointing every time I opt in, or that the excessive
use of oil at the pasta bur doesn’t make me vom,
but that’s not my point here. My mndom rant isn’t
about the dining hall. It’s about you all.

No more dining hall rants.

Also, the Walt; invitations are ugly.”
