The coolest thing to hap-
pen to Grinnell this summer
was not the "Joe." It was
Lonnski's, a new restaurant
and bar that opened above
the Pub.

Lonnski's started as a
dream for its owner, Lorin
Lease, a native Grinnelllan
and lseyear veteran of the
food industry. It may not seem
like much of a dream when
you first climb the cramped
stairway that leads to the
restaurant. But to Lorin, it is.
“it’s fairly surreal and gratify-
ing just to live out a dream of
any kind,” he said. “It's very
hilfilling just to be here."

The space, which had
been JD's before its owners
moved to the Depot, had been
left vacant since 1998. This
March, Lorin got the lease
and opened on June 1. He and
his wife less pumped plenty
of elbow grease into the two

months in thWKEEanhC place
hadn't been touched in eight
years.

He remembers that his
“major hurdles" were installs
ing the new air conditioner
and furnace and foong the
plumbing.

“The booths were here,
the tables and chairs were
here, some of the light for-
tures were here," Lorin said.

”We won! a more funky ai-

mosphere, someiliing Ihal’s
different than what people
from Grinnell might ops
pref/ale.”

Lonn Lease, owner of

Lonnski’s Pub and Deli

“So basically we had to just
kind of repaint and update."
Now the space is clean-
lined and cheerful with corn-
fortable wood booths. but it's

not the renowtions that make
Lonnskis so special.

When Lonn opened, he
hired Grinnell students to
help him through the first
months. “We were lucky to
get a really good staff right
away and a lot of those peo-
ple scaled back their hours
once school started, but it's
definitely a concerted effort
of ours to employ students,"
Lonn said.

“It has a chill atmosphere,"
said Hannah Zurko '08, who
is one ofLonnski's employees.
"It’s a fun place.

“We want more ofa funky
atmosphere, something that’s
different than what people
from Grinnell and other
smaller towns who come in
here might appreciate.”

And then there’s the food:
salads, sandwiches, and soups
that Lonnski and his wife in-
vented in “little bits and piece
cs along the way" during 14
years in the restaurant busit

ness. As a vegetarian himself,
Lorin has also created plenty
of tasty vegetairan entrees.

The drinks are quality, too,

’ll’s fairly surreal and grail-

ij/ingjusi {0 live ouia dream
ofony kind. II'S very fulfill-
ing/us! to be here.”
Lonn Lease, owner of
Lonnski’s Pub and Deli

Lonn has a “no crap on tap"
policy, and serves two beers
from an lowa City micro-
brewery, Cnptial City Brew-
ers. He supports local brew-
eries and brings “something a
little bit unique” to Grinnell,

As Lonn points out:,
"Some of the places around
here are dominated by do
mest‘ic draft beers." For those
of you on more of budget,
however, there's still the usual
PBR cans and Bud Light

people who didn’t evacuate hadn’t expected to leave at all."snid Amy Rothbaum
’08,who went on the same trip.

This summer, 12 Grinnell students and one Grinnell alum spent several
weeks providing humanitarian relief for the citizens ofNew Orleans, with the
assistance of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana. According to Libby anrot
'07,the profound impact this experience left on the participants pushed them to
form a new student organization this year, ReNew OrleansThc group plans to
raise awareness about the “need for the continued rcsponsc"in the city one yeal
sincc Katrina struck.

Rchw Orleans plans to schedule their first trip to the city during fall break,
to provide aid before FEMA stops their current free services of transporting
gutted items to the landfills in November. Many students noted the lack of gov-
ernmenral involvement in the process when they were working there initially.
Said Tran, “I saw a lot of groups by the people and I didn’t really see groups by
the government. ”

ReNew Orleans volunteer work will primarily involve the “gutting” ofhous-
es. When gutting, students remove the damaged materials and salvage the pos-
sessions least harmed. The pressure to help New Orleans specifically made rho
group’s founders decide to distinguish themselves from Alt Break, which serves
many different areas.

Besides the actual trips to New Orleans, the group will provide other oppor
tunities for the student population, and the town ofGrinnell as a whole, to get
involved. ReNew Orleans is actively searching for sources offunding.

On Sept. 16, the Grinnell Multicultural Alliance (GMA) will host Fukar
desi, a Chicagorbased band, on campus, ReNew Orleans will collaborate with
the GMA for this benefit concert, expected to be the first ofmany fundraising
activities.

Last Tuesday, in the Forum South Lounge, the infant organization gave a
presentation to raise awareness regarding New Orleans. It began with a slide
show composed of pictures taken immediately posrekarrina, followed by pics
tutes taken by Grinnellians during this summer giving the audience a glimpse
of the devastation still present 10 months later, ReNew Orleans was defined as
a “very individualrbased organization" with little to no stress on politics, at least
in the short run.

The group's members, many ofwhom went to New Otlcans,wantcd to im—
press on the campus that even from
Grinnell students can make a differ-
ence. The original intentions for Alt
Break were primarily rooted in a need
to get out ofGrinncll. "[1] expected to
be shocked, knew it was going to be
worse than I thought, and it was," said
Favrot. When they returned to college
and “business as usual" most of these
students had difficulty making the

This Grinnellian work—
force helped Lonn create a
place that welcomes ecletic
people.

He said that he and his
wife wanted to serve their
community by welcoming
“anybody from college
students to construction
[workers] We felt like that
was really something kind of
lacking here,"Lonn said. “We
felt like we mated to make an
impact here on a little smaller
scale."
