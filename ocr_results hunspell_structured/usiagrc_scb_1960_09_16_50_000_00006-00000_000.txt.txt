Grinnell college has tradition-
ally been a “pioneer." .1: was
one of the first to bring higher
education to the “real America”
of 18467the struggling, exp‘aud-
ing West. In its growing asso-
ciation 'with Ahmednagar 'col-
lege, Grinncll has continued this‘-
tradition: Ahmcdnagar is a lead-
er among thosc striving to cdtla
'caie the “real India" of today—
the 700,000 primitive, impover—
ished villages.

This struggle is unc‘ with his
dia's attempt to lift f hcrscll
drom poverty and impotoncy to‘
prosperity and leadership among
the free nations of Asia. Be-
rore many of the essential Tc—
forms can be made, education
must be brought to the people.

the progress, encouraging. This

Hivaic received his B. D, de-
gr'ee from Andover Theological
seminary and his'Ph. D. from
Harvard university. When he
returned to India in 1945 he
found that,the majority of hisI
countxymcn and an even larger‘
proportion of the Christians in
Bumbay state were too poor to
attend the expensive big city
colleges that were at that time
the only ones in existence.

Although nivnle had
funds for such a project
any promise of them, the
cause and the man were too
great to be stopped so easily.
Flying to the United States,
he found a friend in the
'groat William “I dare you"

stantial grant. an gratitude
