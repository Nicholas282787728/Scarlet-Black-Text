Way Out in London

B) Shelley Reid

Livmg ma London hat is certainly what
could be called a Learning Experience,
This is a catclrall phr' e which includes
everything ironi getting oil at the wrong
tubc stop to arguing with British Telecom
about installing our phone service without
a lidpmmd (leposll, it‘s the plt"lse to use
when what )ou really want to say is ' Why
the hell (ll(l i come to London in the t st
place"‘l!!

I mentioned last that it shower is
somewhat oi a limit). at least in our price
range What that means is that our {lot
doesn t have one We do have a bathtub

rapidly) you grape lor the shampoo on the
shell above you. (lump some on your head.
and attempt to rub it into a lather.

At this point. you mutter a short prayer
that neither your knees nor your back give
out on you. for it you are lorced to
straighten up. you will send soapy water-
streaming down your back all over the
tloor. ii the water in the sink still appears
clean, you can dunk your head back in

or you waht another shot at getting the

shampoo out. or you are intending to use
creme rinse and conditioner, you must let
the water out and ,run a new smki'ul 7
without raising your head.

Another quaint Ieature of our flat is the
com-operated gas meter. which supplies
energy to heat our water and cook our
food For 50 pence, we get an undetermin-
ed amount of gas II we should accidental-
ly run out ot gas while our gas appliances
are running. something horrible will hapc
pen (our landlady was unnérvingly vague
on this pointl. So we just keep plugging our

5010 coins into the meter at every oppor-

Westminster Abbey, There are some Leare

There are also some Learning 12x7

the entire place was FILTHY I'm not talk-

since the previous tenants had left No. this
was GRIME.

'spend my iirst weekend here scrubbing a
bathroom. I would not have believed it I
can do that at home. The more we cleaned

course. but so is McNally's, And there are
plenty of pigeons on the outside window
ledges to entertain us during breakiast. or
as we blow-dry our hair in the morning.

There are. oi course. some things about
living in an apartment or dorm that never
change. The interior decorating 7 in our
case. done in brown. gold. green, and
orange 7 Still lraves much to be destred.
The windows don't all seal completely
shut, ’lnd the noise from the street at night
is continuous (at least Grinnelllans sleep
SOME or the time). And the guys upstairs
STILL play their sieieo too loudly and
sound like a herd of stampedinz buffalo.

So, was it worth all of the panic, all the
sore ieet, all the getting lost (all the
MONEY)? Well. Sitting here by the wins
dow in my three layers of clothing, wat-
ching the people and the busses and the
rain, and drinking a hot cup oi PG Tips
tthe nation's favorite tea), I feel just a lit-
tle hit like a Londoner, So I guess that the
answer must be yes,
