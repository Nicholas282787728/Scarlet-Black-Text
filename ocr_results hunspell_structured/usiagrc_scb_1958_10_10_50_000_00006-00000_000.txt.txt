all the pageantry which was as-
sociated with this hattle in pre-

toss-up. Don’t forget:

“Ein Prosit"

Downstairs, a hit of Germany
has been transplanted. 1n the
recreation room are small
tahies covered~ wrth red checked
cloths. On the paneled walls
are stems and knick—knacks
from Germany, including a
plaque which bears the toast,
“Em Prosit!"

If, is in this room that Gus
and Elsie have often enter-
tained students they have
come to know. German melo-
dies fill the air as Gus leads
everyone in polka after polka.
And when the others tire, Gus
is ready to start the schottish,
which he does with equal
grace. Elsie won't. dance, but
she hustles around serving
coffee and pastry.

At home Elsie does the cook-
ing, and Gus relishes her Ger—
man dishes, particularly sauer-
hraten and potato dumplings.

' But here at school it’s Gus
who takes over in the kitchen.
Ask him the recipe for a cer.
tain dish, and he smiles and
shrugs. “Oh, I don’t know,” he
says in his soft—spoken accent.
But he doesn’t misjudge. And’
he doesn’t mind waiting till the
last moment to prepare food so
that it holds that special flavor.
For, as Bob Eisele says, “Gus
is not a cook. He’s a chef."
