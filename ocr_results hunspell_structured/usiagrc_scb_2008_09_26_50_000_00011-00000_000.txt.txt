Grinnell’ 5 model railroad club expounds on the beauty of trains and why they make people choo- c oose Grinnell

Bv MANDO MONTANO

The model train slithers around the miniature replica of
Grinnell, Iowa. It is the 1950s, and the miniature people are
dressed accordingly us they stand on the street outside a 1950s
drncr,whilc a Spaulding cit factory towers over Central Park.

Mike Thorndike, treasurer of Grinnell Railway Express—
Grinnell's model railroad club—towers above the miniature
town manipulatmg the speed, lights. and sounds ofthe model
train like a greyehaitetl DJ.

While not all Gl innell residents share Thorndike's passion
for trains, the trains'shrill whistles and quaint charm have ale
lowed them to chug straight through campus and into the
hearts ofGrinnellians past and present.

Thorndike Orland Mitchell 55, and Gordon Bottliwick
felt so strongly connected to the trains that run thioitg h
Grinnell that0 they founded the Grinnell Model Railioad Club
five years ago, and built the miniature replica otthc Grinnell
train system,

Mitchell,who grew up in Eldoru, Iowa, with nightly waile
ing oftrains lulling him to sleep, said he helped found the club
because he believes the trains make up a large part of both
the town and the college's culture. “The trains are the most
exciting part or Grmnell," he said. “Back when 1 went here,
you could take the train from Eldon to Grinncll, and ifthei'e
were enough students waiting Ill‘ the college. the train would
pielt them up."

All of the train tracks in Grinnell were laid in the 18605,
shortly after the town formed. The trains that go through
campus from north to south run on Sunday, Tuesday, and
Thursday, transporting corn from Marshalirown to Eddyville.
The eastewcst line that cuts through town runs from Omaha
to Chicago and stops in Grinnell daily at 7 am.

Tiain enthusiast and recent Grinnell alum, Mike Cum-
mings '07, grew up building model trains in a suburb of Chie
cage, “1 saw the train go through campus and decided I had
to come here," he said. Cummings joined the club during his
ﬁrst year at Grinnell and helped build the scenery for the
club's model train. Now working as a teacher in Marshal}
town, Cummings makes biweekly trips to the Grinnell tmin

club to honor the town trains and share in a passion for all
things railroad,

Not only are the Grinnell trains an object of passion, but
a promoter ofit as well—they played a large part in the 19505
Grinnell dating scene. When Mitchell worked as a night guard
for the campus during his college years, people would blame
the train for their late return to their genderesegregated dormsr

around in the 505," Orland said, hinting at the real reason peo
ple returned to their dorms late.

While trains may no longer be essential in pulling otta late-
night tryst, they remain a typical excuse for tardiness as well
as a Grinnell icon. Next time you hear the morning whistle of
the Iowa Interstate, or the southbound chugging of the Union
Pacific, take a moment to appreciate the Grinnell trains as they
pass on down the line.

When Classics professor Fisk Brewer
relocated from the University of South
Carolina to. Grinnell Collegv—then called
Iowa Colleges—he brought along one or his
students; Hannibal Ketshaw. Kershaw coin-
pleted his studies, majoring in Classics, and
graduated in 1379 as the college's first black
graduate.

After graduating, he returned to the

and preaching in a Methodist church in the

small town of Society Hill, s.c.
In iS81,-l(etshawwas electedto the South
Carolina state legislature, "by an overwhelm-

ing colored vote,” according to his obituary tn -

the Iowa College New: Letter Unfortunately,
he never got to serve because he was “counted

» out by methods peculiar to that section oftl-ie

coun
Kersliaw completed his seminary studies
in 1883, and was ordained as a minister and

assigned to a Methodist church in Beaufort, -

South Carolina. Butjust five months later, he
contracted lung fever and died at the age of
26.

His illness left him "impaired in health,
and his constitution, never entirely vigorous,
yielded readily to consumption," according to
the N21!” Lula:

Kershaw’s obituary called him “an earnest,

and a man when. all respected for his moral

, and religious character."

The NIH}; Letter lamented the loss of
Kershaw, reading “It is seldom we are called
upon to chronicle the death of an alumnus in
less than four years after he has left his ulmiz
mm,“

“The great need of the colored people of
the south,” it continued. “is the inﬂuence of
educated and devoted men of Lheiz own race;
and Mr, Kelshaw’s death seems the untimely
endof a career that promised gtcat usefule
ness."

Originally called East 'I-lall “B" after its
construction, it was renamed Kershaw Hall on
February23, 2006.
