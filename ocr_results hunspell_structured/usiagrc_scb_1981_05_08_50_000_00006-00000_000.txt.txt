South African divestiture: does Grinnell fit in?

, by Anne Bordonaro

The Board of Trustees rejected the
South Alrican Support Group‘s request
for divestiture from Grinnell’s South
Alrican assets Friday afternoon after
four members of the group met with the
trustees. Fritz Maytag, chairman oi the
trustees, said that although they have
decided not to divest, they are forming
a committee to look into the issue. He
explained that the board was not con-
vinced that it is the role of a college to
take a moral stance on political issues
and that they are unsure how to respond
to the South Alrican issue in particular,
admittedly because he said they do not
know enough about it.

Dennis Brutus, a political exile from
South Mrica and poet/protessor at Nor»
thwestern University, addressed
arguments against divestiture similar
to these in his speech Friday night and
rejected them as invalid. He stressed
that Grinnell students and all
Americans have a responsibility not to
stop in the light against oppression and
he sees divestiture as a necessary ac-
tion.

Maytag, Brutus and the SASG all
agree that Grinnell has great potential
pow'er and inﬂuence in the moral
realm. Brutus and the SASG believe
that while Grinnell‘s decision whether
or not to take an ethical stance on this
particular issue will be rather insignifi-
cant to either Grinnell or South Africa.
it will have great psychological ins
{luence on other organizations and in-
stitutions, It may also reshape
Grinnell‘s reputation as a college of
concerned, active and liberal ins
dividuals.

Brutus also emphasized that America
as a whole has considerable inﬂuence
around the world as the established
seat oi democracy, equality and
freedom. The combined actions of
organizations, colleges and the governe
ment on the issue of apartheid in South
Africa will determine whether Third
World nations will continue to look to
the United States for guidance or not.
Brutus also made the point that the
combined actions of American insitu-
tions to divest will seriously hurt the
racist South African government by
weakening the economy on which they
depend tor much oi their power.

The SASG has called {or divestiture
because it believes that other intracor-
porational changes have proved inef-
lectual. For example a group of con-
cerned students proposed divestiture
from South Africa and in 1977 the board
agreed to vote instead for proxy resolur
tions which they said would result in
true progress in human rights within
the countries. However, proxy resolu-
tions were not Voted on until this year
and then two were rejected and one was
abstained from:

The SASG iurther believes that the

Sullivan principles, a set or guidelines
for fairer working and living conditions
iorumulated in i976 aiter the Soweto
Rebellion, are also ineffectual. These
principles apply only to the 20,000 black
workers out of a force oi seven million
who are employed by American coma
panics. At present, only eight of the 13
companies in which Grinnell owns
stock adhere to these principles. No
companies which are signatories and in
which Grinnell owns stock are GM. and
I.B.M. At the end of 1:773, G.M.
employed only four blacks out of its
4,500 salaried employees in its South
African affilitate and I.B.M. only had
iour black managers out of 1,443
employees. The SASG has concluded
that divestiture as a statement of Grin-
nell's disavowment of apartheid is the
only appropriate response remaining.

only i3 percent or South lurican land
but house about 70 percent of black
South Africans. Education, sewage and
water facilities, health care, and
employment opportunities are clearly
lacking on these Banustans.

Maytag said he and the board clearly
saw decisions about action in South
Africa as a double-issue. It ﬁrst ins
volves the “generic issue" of how and
when it is appropriate for a college to
step beyond the purely financial realm
to take a moral stand on political
issues. Secondly, it involves how Grin-
nell ought to respond to the issue of
South Africa in particular, They have
formed a new committee which will
hopeiully present a iinal decision on
divestment or other actions at the Oct.
31, 1981, board meeting. Maytag said
this new “Committee on Investment

“..'. Grinnell students and all Americans
have a responsibility not to stop in the

ﬁght against oppression ..."

Maytag explained that the board does
not approve of apartheid and pointed
out that in 1973, the board made a lor-
mal statement or its acceptance of
ethical responsibility as an investor.
However, members are uncertain how
this applies in real issues such as the
question of action in Souﬂi Africa. He
said that the board is uncertain where
the threshold between moral respon»
sibility, action and pure money-ma king
lies,

Brutus feels that oppression in South .

Africa is singular because it is based on
institutional racism. Dick Clark.
former Iowa Senator, said in a speech
last year that South Africa is the only
country in the world where all social,
political and economic rights are
prescribed by race. For example, in a
country where so percent of the popula-
tion is black, blacks are denied me right
to vote, to own land, to pass in white
areas and to congregate in groups of 10
or more. There are separate education
systems of which the black system is
clearly deficient, Blacks are subject to
arbitrary arrest and harassment. At
present, a black miner earns an
average of $103 a month while his white
counterpart earns an average of $722 a
month. Blacks are prohibited from
organizing in labor unions or striking.
Perhaps the worst expression or apar-
theid is the aggregation of blacks onto
Bantustans, similar to small com-
munes or reservations. They comprise

Responsibility" will look into allegar
tions of corporate inaction to improve
human rights, will investigate opinions
both for and against divestment and
will examine how other colleges have
responded to the issues. Maytag en-
couraged any interested studenc to
voice opinions on those issues or to sug
gest ways of educating the board and
other students such as student meetings
with corporate heads to demand exact
descriptions of their_actions in reducing
apartheid. Questions may be addressed
to Trustee Fred Little.

Brutus addressed both those and
similar arguments against divestiture
Friday night. First, Brutus responded
to the argument that divestiture pro
bahly won't make a difference and said
that the South Airican press and
government contradict this View. He
said the government is extremely con-
cerned with the possibility oi rejection
by the world community it enough
organizations call for divestment. The
government sees divestment as a
serious blow to the economy which they
control and on which they depend for
their power. in tact, divestment is such
a tear that the goverment recently
passed a law making it illegal for a
black to mention divestment in public.
At present, Brutus feels the white
government believes it has an ally in
Ronald Reagan who has voiced his
desire not to emphasize human rights in
his foreign policy and who sees the
