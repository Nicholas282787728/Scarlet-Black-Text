Stone Fails to [m

By John Marion.

To have an extreme radical
scheme confronted by the expert
knowledge of a specialist seemed
to be the most interesting and
educational idea the lecture
coursc committee could secure,
according to F. L, Baumann.
chairman of the committee.

This was the reason the com-
mittee carded the debate between
Dr. Francis E, Townsend and
Raleigh W. Stone to show up the
absurdity of the Townsend old
age pension. plan.

Conservative Economist.

0n the recommendation of a
member of the faculty who had
studied under him, Stone was
secured as Townsend's opponent.
He is regarded as a competent.
conservative economist and a
good class room instructor.

For many reasons. it was a
dramatic spectacle at the debate.
The students sensed the hostility
of the old folks toward them. it
was a case of generally unin-
formed olderly people facing
young students of economics who
realize that the plan will be paid
for by them in the future.
Townsendites Hostile.

The old folks were hostile to-
ward Stone, and fussed him so
that he could not give intelligent
arguments. He forgot the com-
mon sense questions to ask
Townsend which would have easi—
ly won the debate. it was the
unusual case of an educated man
being baffled by the superficialr
ity of the arguments of his oppo-
nent.

Evidently not at home facing a
a large and hostile audience.
Stone could not overcome this
strange situation. However, stone

The humor of the situation

‘Men +0 Give
Fingerprinl’s

Dormitories Agree
To Aid FBI Plans '
Of Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting for all Crinncll
college men was approved in an
all-dormitory vote this week, one
cording to Paul Carlson, president
of the Council of House Presi-
dents.

The arrangements for the fin-
gerprinting for civil purposes is
under the direction of Fred Ho»
mann, president of the Pre Law
club.

According to Homann, Federal
Bureau of Investigation Agent
Coultor will be on the campus
Nov. 21 to address the Pre Law
club and probably instruct a
member of each hall to take the
fingerprints of every resident of
his bail.

Carlson said that Grinnell will
be the first college in Iowa to aid
in fingerprinting in cooperation
with the Federal Bureau of inves-
tigation.

One hall voted against the
plan, but according to Carlson,
every man on the campus will
submit to the process, the results
to be added to the millions now
on file in the crime laboratories
in Washington.

Da’re Bureau
Slorls Slowly

Approximately Fifty
Signed Up; Expect
Increase to 200

App] ximately 50 persons have
signed up for thc Grinncll dating
bureau, according to Joseph
Woodward, head of the bureau.

The idea is slow in taking root,
Woodward cxplaincd, but he
hopes to increase the membership
with an active campaign to be
sponsored in the near future. 4

“All students who do sign up
for the dating bureau will not be
under obligation to take any
dates unless they want to," he
said, ”Our idea is to get more
people to date and to get some
thing new on the campus,"

The bureau will be in running
order as soon as the enrollment
increases, Woodward stated.

“We hope to have at least two
hundred men and women on file
as patrons of the bureau." he
said.

He added that the small fee
charged will go toward buying
new games for the White House
recreation rooms.
