Afro-American position
. center of controversy

by Owen Charles and Lois Har-
rison

“I believe u-iere is something in
the air which deserves serious at-
tention that has not been treated
appropriately," remarked Rory
Slater, chairman of the Political
Organization of the Black Student
Council in an 8&3 interview
Wednesday. He was referring to
the recent controversy over the
search for an Afro-American
Literature professor which has
been brewing among students.
laculty. and administration, yet
has not been clearly understood
on campus.

Most recently, the controversy
has resulted in a critical exchange
of letters and opinions between
Director of Minority Affairs
LaVeta Small. English Professor
James Kissane. black students.
President Drake. English Depart
ment chairperson Elizabeth
Dobbs and Dean Catherine
Frazer. The end results have been
Kissane’s resignation as Depart»
ment chairperson as a protest
against what he believes to be a
case of reverse discrimination
Also. charges of racial insensitivi-
ty on the part oi Kissane in his lets
ter to the iaculty made by black
students and by Small and most
recently, the ending oi the search
for a professor to fill the Afr0~
American Literature position.

The issue is a complex, multl-
faceted one involving many iris
dividuals, events, and opinions. it
is therefore necessary to explain
the development of this controver-
sy in terms oi the chronological
order oi events which began with
Alice Deck’s resignation last sums
mer.

After Deck vacated her position
as assistant professor of Afro-
American Literature, Kenneth
Chambers was contracted to fill
the position temporarily until a
replacement was officially
chosen.

The national search for can
didates to fill the position was
begun at the beginning oi last
semester. According to Kissane,
two ”strong” candidates were
cited from a field of candidates
(one white female, one black

male). Kenneth Chambers was
not cited among the top two, ac-
cording to LaVeta Small, even
though he was currently holding
the position.

According to statements by
George Drake (5&8, 1/27/84),
Dean Frazer had informed
Kissane over winter break that
“one of (his) choices for the job
would not be acceptable because
she is white” Soon after, in early
January. Kissane resigned as
chairperson of the English
Department in protest and
Elizabeth Dobbs took over,

Affirmative Action Officer Lin-
da Johnsrud issued a memoranr
dum to the faculty in early
February stating that the college
has a “, .pool for this position that
does not include an acceptable
minority candidate." The judg~
ment made in the selection of the
top two candidates was questione
ed further by Small in her
resposne to Kissane's letter to the
faculty. Small noted that the white
women “has a primary research
in Renaissance Literature for an
Afro-American Literature posi»
tion." and added, “the second
(candidate). the black male, does
not believe ln (either) the Negro
Tradition or Black Aesthetic in
AfrorAmerican Literature.” She
commented further last week on
the importance oi having a pro-
lessor wiui primary research in
Afro-American Literature, and
the importance oi a balance oi
perspectives in the department.

Dobbs met with Chairperson of
AfrosAmerican Studies Concen-
tration Randy Roth and Small on
Feb. 6 to send out invitations to
eight black students so they could
meet candidates applying for the
position, Invitations were
reportedly sent out by Dobbs Feb.
10, but none were received.

On Feb. ii, Kissane responded
to Jnhnsrud‘s memorandum with
a threevpage letter to the iaculty
stating that one of Johnsrud's
remarks (that the college “does
not have any positions which will
be filled only by candidates of
minority status”, was in direct
contradiction to “what I was told
by the Dean and the President on

Dentel signs as
questions remain

By Jeiirey nuymond

Georgia Dentel has signed a
new hall-time contract that also
cuts her salary, but there are still
unspecified stipulations to be
Worked out. Meanwhile, other
questions regarding the situation
have been raised.

There is little change between
the two job descriptions, accor-
ding to Dentel and Dean oi stu-
dent Affairs Jim Tederman. In a
letter to the editor (see Op-Ed
pages), Dentel explains that she
sought to reduce her obligations in
the new contract in order to
refelct hei- salary-cut but had lit-
tlle success in doing so.

College President George
Drake said, ”We're attempting to
work this out in a way such that
me programs won't suffer. That's
certainly not our intention."
However, Dentel stated, “1 am not
sure that the present level oi pro-
gramming can he promised with

reduced attention... I will do my
best to develop a satisfactory pro
gram within the context of the
half-time program."

When asked whether she
thought that a reduction in her
position would affect the Student
chairs who work with her to bring
in programs, Dentel said, ”I
wouldn’t think that it would affect
them one way or another. except
that perhaps they will have less
access to me since I‘m only work-
ing in a half-time position."

One issue that was raised out-
side ol the negotiggons between
Dentel and' e administration
concerns Dentel's office hours.
Jenny Erickson, director of the
Forum, said that Dentel’s former
job description stipulated that she
spend at least 10 hours each week
on campus.

According to Erickson, though.
Dentel does not keep these hours

Jan. 9." in his lettel Kissane also
made several other points:

“To begin “nth, [here must be nu
nusunderslunrl concerning Iliis: lhe
issue is no! u matter of the Enghsh
departments honing wished to uppolnl
o nonmlnonly candidate, We have
never had such a lush; ours is a wish
to make the best uppatntmenl we
curt,

”Ms. Jahnsrud‘s letter asserts that
'lua of the jop three were minorlly
candidates. ’Apparently Ms Johnsrud
was not tn full possesslan o/ the facts;
the Engllsh department‘s lnlliol re
quest to the Dzizn was that we be
allowed to tnUllE ”an candldales.
When the Dean advised us that Iii-u
would be all we would inittafly be per-
mitted, she was informed that our
clear chatcz would be i1 black mail and
a white woman ,.

"I am ccrlulnly not soylng that no
tnndlale, all the basis of due con~
srdemhon, coulll possibly have been
preferred above her {the white cans
didale} 1 om only soyrng that she
would have been eligible /ur genuine

her chance... '

“The other lhlng lhot slunds out is

nylng that the college nneds more

question whelhcr cucn ihul need 15
necessarily greater lhnn a need lo
nuucrlue positions honestly and to
mislead no appltcunls knowingly "

By no means was this the end of
the story. however. On Feb. 16.
Small countered Kissane's letter
with charges or "racial insenr
Sitlvity” and “public humiliation
of Ken Chambers." Her letter was
addressed to Klssane and sent to
only a lew administrators and
iaculty, and students.

The 8&3 obtained a copy oi the
letter from the involved students
Small made three recommenda-
tions and several points:

”My perception is that your memo
was tnherently insenstriue und
dtsplays total disregard for the libel

”First, you exhibited poor judge

Caucuses

By Jeffrey Raymond with
Patricia Westfield

College students descended on
Fairview School Monday, night
like so many children out trick or
treating on Halloween as they
made their way to the polling site
of Grinnell's first ward caucus.
where George McGovern scored a
victory and Grinnellians enjoyed
an evening of participatory
democracy.

Between the college students,
faculty, omer staff and town
residents. the turnout of 319 voters
at Fairview doubled the expecta
tions of caucus organizers and ac-
counted for over 40 percent of
Poweshiek County’s total Vote.
The first ward caucus gave
McGovern eight delegates to
Walter Mondale’s six and Alan
Cranston’s six. Of the four wards
in Grinnell, McGovern did his best
in the first ward, where the col-
lege is located.

When the group of voters split
into the presidential prelerence
groups, McGovern, Mondale and
Cranston were the only groups
that had at least 15 percent of the
voters, which made them viable
candidates and allowed them to
elect their own delegates.

Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson
had sizable groups of support in
the ward, but failed to gather 15
percent of the crowd. There was a
tiny Reubin Askew delegation
which left shortly alter realizing
that they would not effect the out-
come of the caucus. Ernest Holl-
ings and John Glenn failed to cap

spur
student politicking

ture even a single vote at the
event

The Hart and Jackson groups
then had to decide where they
should place their support and
which group would give their can-
didate some representation at the
next caucus level. The Hart group
did not waste much time before
joining the Cranston delegation
after having been promised to
allow two of thelr own delegates to
go to the next level under the
Cranston banner.

(When Hie situation arises that
a group is a fairly large size but is
still too small to be viable and
have its own delegates, they can
ally themselves with another
group that is looking for more
voters, even if the voters actually
support and elect a delegate who
supports another candidate. This
gives the appearance oi having
more support than actually exists.
and actually gives both groups
more inﬂuence.)

The Jackson delegation at one
point had an offer from the Mon-
dale contingent that would have
given the 22 Jackson supporters
three delegates and several alter-
hates at the next caucus level.
However, the Jackson people ap
parently ielt ideologically closer
to McGovern and accepted mat
group's otter of one delegate and
six alternates.

Most people in the overwhelm—
ingly student dominated crowd
were attending the “firsbin-the-
nation" Iowa Caucuses for the
first time. Roving Reporter
Patricia Westfield talked to
several students and other college
