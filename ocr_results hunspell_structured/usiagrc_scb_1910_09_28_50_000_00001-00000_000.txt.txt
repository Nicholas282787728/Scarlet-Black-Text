Alter the third of a series of try-
outs in which iot'ii'rl\\0 men have
competed, the old members oi the Glee

and elected the tellowiug lnen to mem-
bership: First tenor, Harry De Bells,

\\ill be ﬁlled at a meeting this evening.

The old members or the Club are as

An unusually good lot 01' material
showed up at [he tryouts this year, and
in some cases it was extremely ditti-
cult to choose between the various cam
didates.

Prospects were never better for a
good Club. The tenor - ctioit, espec-
ially the first tenor, which is always
diliicuit to ﬁll, is doubtless as strong
it has ever been in the history
