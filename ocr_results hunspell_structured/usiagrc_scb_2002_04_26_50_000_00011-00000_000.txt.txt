Softball

A few clutch hits and a lot of kate Reynolds ’05 helped the Gllrlt
nelI softball team record two wins in tour games last weekend In
Illinois.

Reynolds (so, 1,50 ERA) pitched in all four games and recorded two
vittories, striking out eight and walking none in a 4,2 victory over
Monmouth. she has compiled 139 strikeouts in just 22 career appearr
ances, already a season record and more than halfway toward the career
mark of 232, set by Jan Maxwell '00 (1997-2000).

offensively,~the Pioneers capitalized on a flurry or Scots errors and
scored all four runs in the sixth inning. torraine Gaynor ‘04 singled,
advanced to second on an error and scored on another iniscue at first
base. christina Brewers '04 RBI single plated lindsey LaPointe '04 and
catcher Annle Iceman '05, who reached on an error at short and later
scored on a passed hall

Defensive miscues contributed to another late-inning Gnnriell rally
in Saturday's 4r3 win over Illinois College. Gaynor reached on a ﬁelding
error at third and advanced to second on a perfect sacriﬁce bunt by
courtnoy Machen '05. Beaman's double to lett scored the winning run
