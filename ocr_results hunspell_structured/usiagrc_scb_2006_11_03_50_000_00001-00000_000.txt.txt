Shuman-Moore

BY SARAH PIERCE

Mme than a month alter the disappearance of Grinnell Col
lege student Paul Shuman-lVloore ’09, and weeks after large searches
wcrc called otr, Grinntll police are continuing to search {or Shii-
tnawh’loorc,

Captain Tim Sittig or the Grinncll policc is now in charge or
the case. Sittig said the senich eti‘orts are now focused on tollowing
leads and using media outlets to adveitise Shumanthloorc's disiipt
pearance.

“Now the leads have slowed down,"said sittigr “The last one we
had was a week and a half ago."

h'losl leads are in the term ofs'tghtings.A female in Kansas City
recently called the station to report she had seen someone IniKCh’
iiig ShumantMoorC's description in a restnumnt. A man in Tim
thought he gave water to a young man who could have been Shii-
nian-Moore. Unfortunately neither of tlic sightings turned out to
be promising

“Right now we look into them, they either turn out not to be
credible. or there is just not enough information for us to keep {017
lowing up on rhcin,"said Sittig.

Sittig said there will be no more local searches until either area-
speeinc leads come in or more orthe local crops are harvested “We
were going to wait for more the crops to come out, and see lfﬁll‘y’
[hing turned up," he said.

Police hope that ifShumaneMoore is in the area,humers will be
able to rind him during the tinic remaining in the hunting season.

Everyone involved in the search errort is trying to publicize the
case as much as possible to ensure that leads continue to come in.
Shuman-Moore's description was entered into the National Center
for Missing Adults. on top ottlic local media that checks in on a
regular basis, the Fox news show Gem/do aanrga did a segment on
the disappearance during their Oct. 9 show.

Shumnn-Moore’s family has handed out thousands of posters
within the Chicago area. His father, Steve Moore, has also spread
word of ShumnntMoore's disappearance acioss the country.

“He has also talked to some or the people atnliated with the
bands and style ofmusic Paul listened to. As they travel throughout
the Midwest they are taking with them ﬂyers that they've got." said
Sittig. “There is a lot or exposure getting out there."

Despite fewer new leads, Sirtig said the Search will continue.

“We will continue to receive information, evaluate that informa-
tion, and take whatever actions we think we need to take,"said Sit»
tig. “We really appreciate the attention that we are getting on this.
The more it is repeated, the more it stays out there, the better our
chances of ﬁnding Paul.”

Students worry BCC is at risk

A planned Athletic Center expansion may threaten the historic building

av JULIA BOTTLES

Construction projects over the past
years have already swallowed up the
old Darby gym, the voiiniter Memo-
rial Health Center, the Chaplain's of-
iice and several collegetowned houses.
As the college begins to plan Phase 11
of the ticw Athletic
and Fitness Cent
ter, some students
worry that the hiss
toric Black Cultural
center (BCC) may
be the next to go.

The second
phase calls for the
construction ofa pool, and it is all but
certain that the construction will head
west toward the BCC, which stands at
the comet of 10th Avenue and Park
Street. A parking lot and the auxiliary
socccr Iicld Springer l’icld lie between
the Athletic Center and the BCC.
lt‘ the addition takes up too much of
springei Field, the college coiiltl C cud
the hold into the space now o iicd
by the BCC, which has lesitlents and
members ofConccrned Black Students
worried.

Planning for this projcct is still
in veiy eiuly stages and nollunﬁ has
been tieci d yet, Piesitlcnt Rl l K,

rote we would malts any change to the
building we would have a long discus-
sion,“ Osgood said, “i would have to be
convinced that it was a good thing, and
I haven’t given it any thought because
the whole thing is very premature."

Many students emphasize the im-
portance and his-
torical significance
of the BCC, built
in 1969. Veronique
Porter ‘08 said it was
built “because [black
students on campus]
felt like they needed
a place on campus
that they could kind of get all ot the
black students to come together and
they could have a home on campus,"
She added that at the time, "campus
was pretty hostile and genig into town
was pretty hostile. It
was just about lliwt
ing a place where
Ilicy could come and
kind 0be united and
be i‘ClthCCl and have
then own environs

speech by Bob Austin '54. an alum and
trustee, brought the crowd to its feet.

Right now, the BCC serves as a
meeting place for snidencs of all races
and backgrounds. said BCC Monitor
Alvin Irby '07. "I think that over time
the role of the BCC has changed a lit-
tle bit, but the signiﬁcance of it hasn't
changed," said lrby. “I feel like regards
less of what goes on at the BCC and
who uses it, it is still going to have his
torical significance."

The BCC could end up threatened
by a desire to preserve an open space in
its area ofcampus. “The trustees do not
want to build on that field," Osgood
said, “Even it’we don't have the soccer
field. there's no plan to put anything on
that field. Tlicy like the green space.“

Some students are ready to light to
keep the center ali and in its current

building.
