Radical Chic

Serllng out to comfort the afﬂicted
and afﬂict the comfortable

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

This week I want to talk about
the mainstream press, Basically, the
mainstream press is part ofthat vast
Orwellian array of inputs which all
function to tell us that the imperial-
ist perspective is right and past. You
will never teadan article in the mainr
stream press which seriously consid.
ets complete nuclear disarmament,
even though that is goal ofthe Non«
proliferation Treaty and the desire of
most ofthe world. Nuclear disarma—
ment is not Within “the realm of
acceptable opinion."

Ofcourse, this realm is not to—
tally without conﬂictand difference,
but the differences are few if vehe—
ment, and the central issue of main
raining US global economic and po—
litical domination over the rest of
the world is never challenged, And
rational policy for improving the
plight oi the nation’s hungry. home—
less, sick, and imprisoned is never
discussed.

This perspective holds true on
every issue, from the drug war to
Haitito Somalia to the peace talks in
Israel to prison reiorrn to Central
America to . . everything. There are
certainvestedintereststhatthe main«
stream media holds dear, and the
range of opinions offered must not
challenge those views, Hence, we
have Clinton as a liberal and David
Boten as the “dove" opinion on mils
irary issues Hence, the gulf war is
gloriiied ior its 5syear anniversary.
And we consider the Washington
Post and New York Times liberal.
The breadth ofacceptable opinion is
narrow indeed

The principal reasons ior media
myopia are threeefold: first, they are
owned by giant corporations; Sec»
and, they play to their advertisers,
giant corporations; and third, gov«
ernment and corporate sources em<
ploy massive public relations estab.
Iishments to sell the imperialist line.

On the iirst point: ten corpora
trons (and falling) own three—fourths
ofthe US press (58 newspapers, the
3 rnaior Tv and radio networks, 34
subsidiaries, 201 cable systems, oz
radio stations, 20 recording compa.
nies, 59 magazines, 41 book publish—
ers, and a variety or movie compa.

niesl Naturally, these corporations
act in their own interests. And their
interests arc busliiess»ft1cuscd. Re»
porters. also, are part ofthe plutocra—
cy. National columnists take in big
bucks not to step on the toes of the
power elite.

Letters to the Editor...

Native Americans and Grinnell
To the Editor:

OnpageGofthe ScarletStBlack
for Fcbtuai’y 2, Bruce Friedrich, the
FeaturesEdirot,statesthat“Orinnell
offers only two courses dealing with
NativeAnicricans, and theyarcboth
inthe Anthropology Department.” I
should like to correct this misstate—
ment oithe iacts in so iar as my own
Department'scoursesareconccrned.
Thc iollowing courses being oiicrcd
by the Department oinstory in this
semesteriio say no motciall deal
with Native Americans: History 1 ii
and l 12 (American Histotyl and II),
History 221 (the American West),
History 222 (the History ofWoinen
in the United States), and History
323 (the Atlantic World, 1400.
1800) I should be happy to provide
Mr. Friedrich or any one else With
syllabi for these courses should evi»
dence beyond my own testimony
seem called for.

D. A. Smith, chair
Department of History
To all Grinnellians:

Name American [to attend] Grin—
nell in 20 years. You would think
that this would initiate something
here, but 1 am tired oiand disgusted
with Grinncll not having but two
classes pertaining to Nutne people

The first class I experienced was
my tiltonal~open only to first—year
students. The second wasconducted
by a professor iiho lias not even a
Grinnellian and it was offered [for]
only one semester. So does Oritincll
have any interest in, or give and
value to, NatiVe culture.I It seems
that “we” do not.

i have experienced overt racism
in two oi my classes so tar. In other
classes, I have seen subtle racism,
and expect to see it again. Yes, there

We celebrate Black History Month

Dear students. faculty and staff of
Gtinnell College:

I’m writing to apologize for rhe
hurt and turmoil caused by state.
ments that I made around this time
last Spring, namely myeditorial chals

ism program. Ofcourse. many must

cation of the editorial, I became a
botnﬂgmn Christian. This was by
no means a spontaneous event, but
rather the culmination of numerous
experiences that God had granted
me. However, it was (luring that
week that l iinallycommittctl my liic
to Jesus and began to earnestly seek
to ioilnw Him and gloriiy Him in all
areas oiiny his,

I knew that I had hurt a lot of

said and the way in which I said
them, and I knew the Lord would

wrongs, to reconcile with the cam»
pus, so to speai. However, i iclt that

in which I had made my statements
