Coach Andy Hamilton seemed to be ev~
erywhere at last weekend’s home tennis tour-
nament. One minute, he would be giving ad-
vice to his no. 3 doubles team. The next, he
would be chatting with parents in the bleach
ers. Then, out of nowhere, he’d appear on the
no. 1 doubles court to remind the bewildered
Monmouth players that they were serving out
ofturn.

His relentless enthusiasm proved effecr
tive. The Pioneers breezed through their
three matches against conference foes Knox,
Monmouth and Lawrence, winning 25 of the
weekend's 27 individual marches, putting the
Pioneers atop the early season standings and
improving their overall record this season to
7-1.

On the court, Hamilton’s players mirrored
his upbeat attitude, constantly exchanging
shouts of encouragement. Two or Grinnell's
top singles players, Camila Alareon '02 and
Susan Klumpner ’08, were particularly vocal.
Their running dialogue included such gems
as "Vamos, Camilal" and “That’s hot, Susan."
Despite the lighthearted atmosphere, though,
the Pioneers won their matches incredibly ef—
ﬁciently. No one dropped a set in singles play.

Captain Katie Colver ’09 was pleased with
the team’s performance. “Ut was really nice to
go out and win by such a big margin," she said,
adding, “everyone's really focused this year."

With the transfer of Klumpner from Law-
rence and the return of Rachel Engh ’08 to
the lineup, Colver sees a lot of potential in the
squad. “We'd love to take another conference
[title]. We‘re at three [conference tides in a
row] now, and I don’t think we’re going to stop
any time soon," she said.

The key to the Pioneers success may lie in
their no. 3 through no. 6 singles players, evi-
dence of the team's depth this season. Colver
is undefeated through seven matches at no, 4
singles, while teammates Margaret Block ’03
and Jill Akiyama'lO, at no. 5 and no.6 singles,
have both lost only once.

Unlike many other MWC teams, the Pio-
neers has impressive depth.

“It’s typical to enounter a team where no. 1
through no. 3 singles are strong, but the rest of
the team is not," said Akiymma, Grinnell’s no.
6 singles player.

“You can give me a school, and I usually
know whether or not I can beat them.”

These singles players will have to sup-

port a weaker doubles side for the Pioneers to
succeed at the conference and NCAA level.
Right now, the Pioneers win 81.5 percent of
their singles matches, but only 63 percent of
their doubles matches,

Colver also attributes this season’s success
to the seamless transition from former head
coach Barb Waite to new head coach Andy
Hamilton, whose ﬁrst season as the women's
coach—he has been the men’s head coach
since 19967has reenergized the team.

“He does a great job. Practices are being
run really smoothly, and he works a lot with
what we need," Colver said.

Looking ahead, the Pioneers are faced with
the daunting task of playing all of their remains
ing matches on the road. Still, Colver remains
positive, noting, “When it comes down to it,
you’re still playing the same person.The court
size is the same everywhere."

Colver also hopes that the team is able to
build on the positive momentum earned with
last weekend’s victories, and ultimately gain a
berth in the D111 National Tournament for
the second year in a row. "Last year, we got a
taste of what it felt like, and now we’re ready to
go in and take care ofbusiness,“ she said with
conviction.

Late Score: Pioneers drop Wednesday’s
match against Centxal

The women’s tennis team couldn’t maintain
the momentum from this weekend’s three vic-
tories, dropping a tight match to Central Col-

'09, Maya Lipert ’09, Margaret Block ’08 and
Jill Akiyama ’10 each winning. The match
marked the Pioneer's last at home this season.
The Pioneers will now spend threc days at
Gustavus Adolphus College at the ITA Res
gionals, where they will face some of the best
competition the Midwest has to offer.

After only three years of golfing, Livingston looks for MWC success

Amy Livingston '09 has the talent that

started playing her senior year of high school

Just three years later, Livingston has become
one ofthe top golfers in the conference.

The Midwest Conference keeps individual

team standings. Right now, Livingston curs

to move into the top rluec by the MWC

Livingston has made major strides over

area which she said "cost me a lot of strokes
last year."

“I hope to bleak into the 70s this season,"
