The CIA Offers Alternatives to Study
Multi-fat'th Study Breaks on Campus...

BY DANYA LEEBAW
Slatfl' Writer

Many students ﬁnd Grinnell Col-
lege a place where they can freely
express their views and themselves
Although Grinnell is considerably
liberal in leanings, a wide spectrum
of views on politics and other issues
exist in the community and are
mostly tolerated. However, a group
of students and faculty were con-
cerned that despite Grinnell’s aura of
tolerance, religion was something
not freely expressed or at least dis
cussed. They consequently
formed a group they call Chap
lains‘ Interfaith Alliance, (CIA);
this Week CIA is holding informal
study breaks all over campus to
open the forum fordiscussions of
religion and spirituality on the
Grinnell campus. ,

CIA includes Deanna Shorb,
Chaplain and Rabbi Jennifer
Flatte, Associate Chaplain, as well
as students from many different re—
ligious traditions. Beyond their in-
terest in addressing issues ofreligion
on campus, members of the group
also plan on holding interfaith learn-
ing gatherings, such as joining reli-
gious groups for worship and other
traditional activities. The group en-
visions promoting “tolerance and
diversity and all those good things,"
Rabbi-Flatte explained with a smile.

Platte explained that certain stu-
dents feel that being religious is
viewed negatively ath'nnell. While
spirituality is accepted and consid-
ered ”okay" by many students, some
students assert that traditional reli-
gion is overlooked or not accepted.
CIA hopes to alter this situation and
create an acceptance for all forms of
worship, in part by getting student

input on how to deal with the lSSuC
of spirituality.

On Tuesday evening at 9 pm, a
small group gathered in Norris
Lounge for one of the CIA study
breaks. Rabbi Flatic was present but
the discussion was led by two sine
dents. The group sat around a table
of snacks and began by introducing
themselves and, ifihey wished, shar-
ing their religious or spiritual back-
ground, Paper and pens were pro-

The group envisions

promoting ‘tolerance
and diversity 'and all
those good things’

vided for students who wanted to
raise questions or issues anonyr
illously. There were also booklets
available listing and explaining tlle
different religious and spiritual
groups on campus and the various
opponunities for worship.

The variety ofrcligious traditions
on campus was exempliﬁed as stu-
dents at the Norris study break de
scribed themselves as Pagan, home
again Christian, Lutheran, from the
Baha’l faith, Christian Scientist and
more. The factlltators explained
CIA’s goals for the study breaks: “to
provide an opportunity for questions
about religious groups, faith in gen-
eral, the state ofrcligion at Grinnell,“
or any other issues participants might
want to raise.

The first question raised by one
panieipant concerned the difference

between religion and spirituality .

One student discussed his Views on

this difference and the others listened ,

attentively. As participants sought to
deﬁne religion and SP1TI|L|8llIy,\’Z|1’1-
ous viewpoints were asserted and
considered respectfully, Soon. an-
other question was raised and dis-
cussed: “How do you decide stanr
dat'ds ofrlgllt and wiongl"

A similar study break. was

‘ siinlutancously occuring for students

in Clark and Dibble dorms. this
one attended by Chaplain Shorb
and also moderated by two slu-
dents. These study breaks even—
tually covered the entire campus
this last week.

The issues CIA hopes to sec
more widely discussed on came
pus will continue to be addressed,
next week during an informal
panel discussion entitled “Faith

and Sexuality: Affinning Sexual Re
alitles.” This panel discussron will
take place on Monday, November 4
at 4:30pm in South Lounge. Rever-
end Mitzi Eilts, coordinator of
ChurchrCollege Relations with the
United Church Board for Homeland
Ministries in Cleveland, Ohio and
Chairperson of the Council for
CLOUT (Christians Lesbians Out),
will be a panel participant, along with
Professor Dennis Haas, Professor
Sylvia Thorson-Smith, Rabbi Jenni-
fer Flatte and student participants.
Rabbi Flatte explained that me
volvement in CIA is open to any in-
terested student. She and CIA hope
to have as many people involved as
possible. Interested students should
contact Rabbi Flattc or Deanna
Shorb at the Ofﬁce of the Chaplain.

Renowned Philosopher Arthur
Danto delivers Convocation

Plio‘io KELLEY WAGERS

By SARAH PILTCH

Reporter

Every Humanities 101 student,
pos5ib1y in 311150 years of Grinnell
College history, has asked, while
struggling through the Iliad and the
Odyssey: What relevance can this
posstbly have to me, my life ormode
ern day?

Arthur C, Danto, Johnsonian Pro-
fessor Emeritus of Philosophy at
Colunlbia University, addressed this
very question in his convocation lec-
ture entitled “The Iliad, July 1996.”
Mr. Danto addressed the audience on
the new perspective he gained on the
iiiad through experiencing of the two
major news events orJuly: the Olym-
pics in Atlanta and the explosion of
TWA Flight 800, Mr. Danto, who
has a summer home on Long Island,
New York, near the site ofthe crush.
witnessed the diving for bodies, the
mourning process, and the response
from the residents. He also watched
the opening ceremonies ofthe Olymr

pic Games in Atlanta, the “tacky
splendidness of low art into which
immense effort and good will had
been put,"

As the Olympic Games proe
gressed Mr. Dante observed the emo-
tion and grief of the athletés, at the
same time keeping up to date on the
bringing into shore ofthe bodies and
fragments of thc TWA wreck, He
recalled the funeral games held to
memorialize the death of Patroclos
in the Iliad, and the similar moumv
ing process occurring through the
Olympic games,

He noted that the Olympics are
looked down upon by some modern
intellectuals for their sellrout to
empty capitalist commercialism, and
recognition of “freak" athletes,
whose abilities become increasingly
unobiainablc and removed from
those ofthe averagc individual. Mr.
Danto said that the emotional re-
sponse ofthe athletes--to collapse in
sobs, or to rejoice in victoryr-is ulti-
mately for the sake of the medal and
imminent money
from endorses
ment deals. Ath~
letes may seem
to be freaks in
their bodily “tor—
ture,“ but Mr.
Danto also sees
in this regard that
all artists are
freaks, in their
corresponding
artistic self-tor-
lure.

The Iliad ends
with Patroclos’ and Hector's bodies
being brought fordisposal (digniﬁed
for Patroclos, undignified for Hec-
tor), and ritualized athletic games are
planned for the memorial. The par-
allel of these events to the

naked eye. ”

“The ingenuity of
Danto’s theory is
most apparent...
where the diﬁference
between artwork and

discernible to the

~Professor S. Goldberg

simulaneous occurrence of the
Olympics and the TWA 880 wreck
led Mr. Danto to ask: what makes
athletic competition an appropriate
reaction to death? As shown by
Mohammed Ali's presentation ofthe
ﬁnal ﬂame in the opening ceremor
llies, athletic events celebrate the
great grace and strength ofthe body.
and are hence a celebration of life.
Competition also brings people to a
high pitch, prizes and recognition
included.

As divers continued to raise the
bodies of those who were on TWA
800, their families waited anxiously,
seemingly conceiving of burial as
offering some degree of closure.
Similarly, Pnam, Hector's father, vise
its Achilles to recover his son‘s body.
He weeps and they philosophize, re-
alizlng that griefwill not bring Hec-
tor back. They feast together and
Achilles gives the body to Priam for
proper burial.

Mr. Danto said that human beings
need closure, and a sense of mean
ing to make
sense of death:
they need to
commemorate
their dead with
symbolic and
ritualistic ac-
tions. Even to-
day, as we are
still unsure ofthe
causes of the
crash of TWA
Flight 800, we
do not know how
to figure out
what [0 do with the tragedy without
knowledge of its cause, We do not
stop mourning, nor did Achilles and
Priam.

Accordtn g to Mr. Danto, we do re
