Reiler Visits Ceylonese Homes-

Takes Purl In Bi

by Becky Reitcr
COLUMBO CEYLON —_ I have
visited th.ee different Ceylon.
cse homes and have always
found a birthday party The pat-
tern has been basically the same
at each one of these sociall
gatherings ‘

The guests star-~tairiving about
6 pm. and keep coming until
it or ’a 30 The people who came
at a start leaving aiound 9 sol
that until midnight people al‘ei
coming and going and one is
kept busy greeting and saving
good bye to people. i

The women sit in the front'
room and visit. while the men
sit outside on the veranda.
There is usually no entertain
merit c cent for a phonograpli'
or rad' , which is continually
played.

A guest begins eating as ;
soon as he arrives and does
not stop until he goes homei
First ascries or sweets—cakes.
pastries and candies—are
‘served.

This is followed by a sweet
drink of some sort and a series
of small vegetable and meat

Isandwiches, meats in pastry
rolls and sausages served on
toothpichs. By the time mild al.
coholic drink is served, it is in
or 10:30 and time for dinner.

Usually dinner consists of!
string hoppers and curry. String
hoppers‘are made of flour and
resemble very thin spaghetti.

‘Curry is a broad term used to
. cover many meat and vegetable
dishes eaten with rice or string
hoppers.

The meats and vegetables are
cut up and served in a sauce
so that they can be mixed with
the string hoppers or rice. Cey-
lonesercurries are quite spicy.

string hoppers are eaten
, with the fingers This can he
done quite efficiently by pick-
ing up the light, dry hopper,
- swirling it around in the cur-
ry and popping it in the

muth.l, i ,

The other main Ceylonese
dish curry‘land rice, is served
with the rice in the center of
the plate and the curries ar—

,ranged around the rice. Each
person mixes the curries and
rice with n spoonand fork to
suit his own taste and then eatsv
the mixture with a spoon. Each
spoonful is mixed individually

..eo that .one doesn't have n hig‘,
mess on'llis plate as I did the
ﬁrst time I ate curry and rice.

Most of the guests are rela—
lives. The ceylenese family in
cludes not only the immediate
family but extends to aunts:
uncles, grandparents nieces,
cousins, etc. There is a very

.close tie among relatives.

\An adult working son or
daughter does not leave home
and take an apartment as he
or she would in the United
states but rather. stays.at home.
The women have much less

than they do in the us it a
boy calls on a girl or takes her
out, usually one member of the
family is present

Marriages aic still arranged
in Ceylon. This is usually done
by the family, but “mill age
bureaus" and “marriage broke~
do actually emst. These
ranged marriages are not as
impersonal as they sound, and
the u hes of the couple mVOlVA
ed are considered. However,
much str s is laid on marrying
into the ”right” family.
Another aspect of the cey-
lonese home which disting-
uishes it from the American
home is the servants Labor is
quite cheap in Ceylon, and

, most homes have at least one

servant. ,

The servants live in their
employer’s home and are closer
Iy tied to the family. For ex—
ample, the sel‘vants’
in turn be employed by
the children of the family when
they set up housekeeping.

1 have found the people to be
exceptionally considerate and
gracious but also quite shy
Every effort was made in the
homes I visited tormake certain
the food was not too hot for me,
and I was waited on»”hand and
foot." However, most oi the peo—
ple, even young women my own
age, would look 'at the floor
when introduced and found it
difficult to inalre light conversa-
tion.

1 encountered one’ exception
to this rule of "shyness" that
proved somewhat amusing. I
was invited to tea one afternoon
by a lady to whom I had spok-

on a tour, which included the
communication center, IBM Cal-
culating center, the plotting
boards and the command post.

~At the command post they
were shown the famous “red

POLITICAL' TASKS i

ample, from a» populous state
with a cross-section of luncllonall‘
interests. the national and local;
interests may be xtaposed due
lto the state's microcosmi
parties.

These “other irected" interests
usually predominate in areas
where the congressman has no
particular interest or exper.tise
lldut when he does, his innelr
directed” interestsehis personal
beliefs and subjective biases~
have considerable weight. i

No one will dissuade Carl Vin-
son from a certain course of ac.
tion in regard to the armed
services or plin Johnston from
one concerning civil service. As
congressmen have the usual hu-
man falllbilities, personal beliefs
enter into the area of informal
policy-making l

The personality and integrity
of n congressman or depart.
ment head, especially when ex-
treme in one direction or an.
other, undoubtedly adds to. or
detracts from, (he_ reception
given his arguments and ré~
questsi

The extent to which Congress
as a whole is influential in over-
all policy' formulation depends
partly on the President. [title is
an effective ,President who can
rally public support and can —~
and will — translate this backing
into personal leadership, then the
influence .of Congress decreases
proportionatly, Whether , Richard
M. Nixon or John F. Kennedy
has these qualities should be
carefully weighed before .Nov. 8.
