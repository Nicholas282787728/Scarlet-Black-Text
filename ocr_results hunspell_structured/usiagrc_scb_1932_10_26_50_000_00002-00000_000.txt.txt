WAS THAT SPORTSMANSHIP‘!

Several days before the recent
student council convocation, it
had beell arranged between those
in charge of the convocation and
the heads of tlle various student.
political groups to have those
groups sit. in special sections ill
tlle chapel. To facilitate finding
those sections each group was to
have banners or pictures design.-
ting tlle party around those sec-
tiolls. _

The democrats put up four
large pictures of Roosevelt in the
chapel several hours before the
convocation time. Republican pier
tures were also put up. However,
when the students entered the
chapel at 11:45 only the republl»
can posters were ill evidence,
Someone had removed tlle denlo-
cratie pictures
. The Scarlet and Black is accus—
ing no one or no organization of
pilfering those pictures, but. asks,
was that sportsmanship?

DISCREPANCY

Quite the reverse of the at
tempts of the high moguls of foot.
ball to make the game safer by
modification of the rules is the
failure of a certain few football;
officials to conduct. the grid eon-l
tests in such a manner that clean
play is insisted upon.

The case referred to here is a re—
cent Grillnell game, in which Cup-
tain Graflund on one occasion
pointed out a piece of unsportsr
malllike work on the part of one
of the opposing players, right un~
der the nose of the referee. Instead
of reprimanding the offender, the
official merely growled at Graf-
lund, “Aw, that’s part of the
game.”

Such conduct is inexcusable and
leads to major injuries if players
discover that they can get. away
with violations of the rules right
in front of the referee. This same
referee officiated a basketball
game last winter on the Grinncll

'ties for the study of the present
,situutioll of the world from a non-

total of 41 personal fouls were
called on the two teams.

Unless officials keep the stan-
(ll (1 0 playing on a high plane,
fans ill see instead 01' clean, or-
ganized football undcrhdnd meth-
ods of “getting” the opponent.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

country. It to furnish to
such a club [ \e litt ature, book.
and a Iii-monthly report. on iutclr
national 1- minus. Such a club has
lwcn established here in Gl‘iullell
college to make a study of inter-
national affairs.

This announcement will no
doubt be greeted with a (loop sigh
ol’ dismay by many who thinki
and justly soﬁthnt our Grillllell
campus is ovcr-ol'ganizcd now.
However, it is not an extra time
added to the already too-full
schedule of meetings. It is to be
held at 7:30 1).)“. on alternate
Sundays. This has always been
the regular meeting time of the
Sunday Evening Club, but because
this International Relations club
seemed such a worthwhile project
it. has agreed that it will alternate
its meetings with the club for the
purpose of discussing internation-
al affairs.

The first meeting of the Inter—
national Relations club was held
last Sunday in the Associations
building. Prof. Charles E. Payne
gave a worthwhile talk to the
large group which turned out to
hear him, His talk was aimed
mainly at college students, and
for benefit of those who were 1m-
able to hear him, a few excerpts
may be given:

”Our generationﬁthe present
college students—Will have to
solve two problems in the future;
namely, that of iutcl'llaticnalism
or non-iuternatiollalism, and the
conflict between capital and la-
bor. Such a task will take cour-
age, intelligence, and patience."

“liltcrnationalism is not pacif-
isln. Pacifism advocates pas 've
resistance rather than ever resort
to war as a means of settling dif-
ferences between nations. Inter»
nationalism strives to avoid war
and will resort to every other
means of settling disputes, but. it
(lees not assuulc the attitude of
the Pacifists.”

Mr. Payne closed his address by
saying that lie thought it was
high time for college men and
women to go into politics instead
of washing their hands of it as a
rotten game.

Before going into politics cer-
tainly we should first have an un-
biased, accurate ,kno\vledgc of
facts. Both the International Re-
lations Club and The League of
Women Voters offer opportuni—

prejudiced, non-partisan View-
point.
