Last week in Washington, Do, the
lorgotten heroes of the Vietnam War were
honored with the dedication of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial. Finally, alter lo
years, the nation is beginning to look back
and come to terms with America’s involve

, ment in Southeast Asia.

For people such as author Frances Fitr
zgerald this marks a hopelul turning point
where Americans need no longer continue
to avoid the issue of the war. One can only
learn from it. “It is important that
Americans, especially the recent genera
lion who was not involved, are made
aware of the process leading to our in-
volvement and mistakes in Vietnam,”
stated Fitzgerald.

As the level of American involvement
grew during the ’605, Americans perceived
the United States' role somewhat difr
lerently than today. “At that time, many
people still considered America a land of
lrontiers . n a sense there were no limits
to our cap
the United States saw it as an enormous
lest lor democracy," claimed Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald made her first trip to war '

torn Vietnam in 1966 as a journalist. ”Then
I didn’t know a whole lot about what was
going on, just that there was a war over in
Southeast Asia. Consequently, i did not go
with mixed ideas," she said.

That first year, however, was enough to
lorm her opinion on the war. Upon return-
ing to the U.S., she busied herself with the
writing of Fire in the Lake, an account of
the conflict, which earned Fitzgerald both

, the Pulitzer and Bancroft Prizes. From
what she saw and experienced in the late
’Gos, the morale of the troops was still fair»
1y high. “Up until about 1968, the soldiers
over there were still pretty gungho about
their purpose in Vietnam. Around mo the
army started lalling apart. I remember

Newsw‘eek‘running 'an article titled *The’

Flaky Army’ discussing all its problems,"
she explained.

Even though the Americans had com-
mitted themselves so extensively, there
were many mixed emotions concerning

llities. Looking at Vietnam, A

the American presence among the very
people the us. was supposedly delending.
“The relation between the people of
Southeast Asia and the Americans were
very complicated. Many, of course,
wanted us there With our aid and military
strength. on the other hand, some hated us
being there with all our wealth and our
destruction of the countryside," Fits
zgerald stated.

According to Fitzgerald, these are some
of the lessions we learn from looking at our
involvement in Indochina. One of the big
gest misperceptions of the U.S. is that we
failed to really consider the internal lace
tors causing upheaval in Vietnam. In Fit»
zgerald's opinion, many forgot that the
war started as an internal civil war, Such
perceptual blinders are not onl found in
Vietnam. “In 1974, if one looke carefully
at the internal tensions within Iran, one
could see and understand that the shah
was going to go,” she pointed out.

In regard to U.S. involvement in Latin
America, Fitzgerald feels the United
States must realize and understand the in
ternal complications causing civil wars
and rebellion. It is not simply a moral
question ol democracy lighting com-
munism.

“For such a long time our foreign policy
was based on and driven by pure moral
principle, such as Vietnam. In this case,
America's policy came back on them," she
stated. “If we look at Israel today, we see
quite a parallel. The government's actions
of late have been strongly questioned by
the people; witness the huge demonstra~
tions," she added,

Concerning the question of student can-
sciousness, Fitzgerald delinitely ieels
some strong changes have taken place
since the end of the war. “Students today
seem more concerned with jobs,
unemployment or pursuing their own in-
terests. They seem to be more apathetic,"
Fitzgerald said.

One problem she pointed out is that the
United States is simply not at war with
anyone, although we do have military ad-
visors in many places. “Even in El
Salvador, where things are very sensitive
regarding our role down there, it is hard
for a majority ol students to get upset over
50 advisers," she explained.

Fitzgerald has been impressed however
by the way the nuclearrl‘reeze movement
has grown. She cites diligent and excellent
organization as one ol its strenghs. ”Yet,
the nuclear-freeze movement is at a disad-
vantage in that the topic is so abstract and
theoretical. The Vietnam War was
delinitely real, people could watch T.V.
and see the war and its effects.”

Turning to the role of the media and its
impact on the public during the war, Fit»
zgerald does not see the media as having
turned public opinion against the ad-
ministration. “There was definitely more
coverage ol the war and less censorship,
but I feel it was the Tet Offensive that real-
1y brought about a change in the public
mind. The media just kept_doing the same
old stuff before and ‘alterwards,” Fits
zgerald claimed.

Looking ahead, Fitzgerald would like to
see the Vietnam War become more of a
topic within the schools and not carelully
avoided, After all, we have had 10 years to
heal the many wounds; now we must come
to terms with our past.

One of die major speakers to address
the Grinnell community in coma
memorating the Vietnam War last week
was former Senator George McGovern, a
man whose own career was affected by the
war. In a whirlwind day filled with
speeches and interviews, McGovern not
only expressed his views on America’s role
in Vietnam but also addressed some cur
rent political problems,

In 1972, McGovern was the Democratic
Party's presidential nominee against
Richard Nixon and took a strong stand
against a war that was serving no national
purpose. “From the very start it was a
misguided effort. The war not only ruined
families and destroyed villages in Viet
nam, but also divided an American
people," stated McGovern.

McGovern emphasized the U.S. govern»
ment's false sense of communism
spreading over the globe, which turned a
local war into an international one. “The
problem in Vietnam was just as much a
struggle for nationalism as communism,
but the United States saw Moscow as the
great trouble causer, If we had approach-
ed Vietnam with a sense of internal strug-
gle, things could have been avoided,”
claimed McGovern.

Along with these misperceptions,
McGovern pointed out how the war con-
tinued to escalate in each different ad-
ministration, ”By 1965, escalation begat
escalation," asserted the senator, “and
President Johnson made it very clear that
he did not want to be the iirst president to
preside over the loss or a war.”

Even though President Nixon finally
brought an end to American involvement,
he did at one point expand the war into
Cambodia. Besides being the victim oi
great paranoia against communism,
McGovern also described Nixon as
subscribing to the domino theory in foreign
politics. “Nixon lelt that it you did not stop
them now. you will have to end up lighting
them sometime later," said McGovern,

. Although the actions of the United States
in the war might have been pridelul and
shortsighted, according to McGovern, they
were by no means immoral. “Us. at»
titudes were very idealistic. We wanted to
buy time against aggression and save a
people. One could perhaps call it virtuous
mischiel." claimed McGovern.

McGovern feels that the present ad-

ministration is making many of the same _

mistakes in Latin America that were made
in Vietnam. “The policymakers are still
assuming that the causes and controlling
force behind the problems in Central
America stem from Moscow. The revolur
tions in Central America‘ have enough
reasons to exist with or without Moscow
being there,” asserted McGovern.

The lormer senator also lelt that Presi-
dent Reagan should have seen lit to go to
the dedication ol the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial. “We need to draw a clear
distinction between the policymakers and
the veterans who paid the highest price.
This is an important day and we should
lean over backwards. World War ll vets
were treated well, as conquering heroes,

yet the Vietnam vets were never given the
recognition they deserved. They lought
just as bravely as any other soldiers," he
asserted.

a.-

Looking back on his presidential race in‘
'72, McGovern voiced no real regrets. ”I
am proud to have been nominated by a ma-
jor political party; it is an extremely high
honor. We ran a very open campaign. no
secrecy, and took on some tough issues
such as the war and tax reform. Thus, any
mistakes we made were also made in the
open, and our mislaks were made from the
heart and not born from malice,” explains
ed McGovern, ‘

Assessing the recent elections and look-
ing forward to '34, McGovern delinitely
sees the Democrats as having made up
quite a bit or lost ground. “I believe that
die president will have to do some backing
down on a few topics that will meet stiff
resistance in Congress, namely the
military budget and third year tax reduc-
tion,“ stated McGovern.

One area that could be open to new
development is the current Americana
Soviet relationship, ii the Soviets elect a
moderate or sominer, in McGovern's opir
nion, “President Reagan’s current poli es
are very much ones of conirontation.
Brezhnev seemed more inclined toward
negotiation. He very much wanted to get
SALT ll passed, and he probably went to
his grave wishing he had been successlul.
Right now all the United States can do is
wait and guess on what might happen. I
believe though that if Brezhnev failed in
their eyes, they may be more inclined to go
with a hardliner," guessed McGovern. ,

If that is the case and Reagan does not
deviate from his strong deterrence view,
such a thing as [he nuclearrlreeze move
ment could take on an added importance in
'54; according to the former senator. “So
far the movement has not offended Conser»
vati‘ves and moderates and is not perceiv-
ed as a radical movement. It would be my
guess that if the current state of affairs
continues the freeze legislation could pass
both the House and the Senate," he con
cluded.
