Alt-Break helps in areas hit by Katrina

by Chlistme Mccoi mick

While most Grinnelllans went home or visited
frielids over fail break, 30 students did some serious
mucking around in Alabama and Mississippi, rip-
ping offcrumbling walls and digging through piles
of past mementos. Those students comprised tliree
Alternative-Break groups who worked with some of
the victims ofHurricane Katrina, as they cleared out
their ﬂoodrdamaged houses and sought to put their
lives back together.

Alt-Break trips during the fall are normally linir
itcd to within a 10rhour driving distance ofGrinncll
for economic reasons, but this year the 18-hour drive
south was appioved because of the strong interest
shown in the trip.

students who organized this fall’s trip down
south were struck by the scvelity of the crisis as well
as the overwhelming response it engendered. “The
leader application process was at the same time as
the Hurricane Relief efforts starred on campus,"
said Kendra Banchy '06, one of the coordinators of
AltrBreak. “A lot of people came to us saying they
wanted to do something directly working with hur»
rlcane victims.)l

Banchy said that despite some initial hesitation
among student coordinators and administratois, the
project was approved. “They said [the trip] was go»
ing to be okay irwe could ﬁgure out a costrcffecrivc
way to do it."

Led by Rose Wilson ’06, Joseph Gryka ’06,
Natalie DeSole ’07, Alex Brooks ‘08 and Mamau
Pokharel ’03, the AltsBreak mega—group sorted
through peoples possessions, ripped up ﬂoors and
tore down sheet rock.

Brooks said gathering an elderly woman’s stat»
teted objects amid the wreckage quickly registered
an emotional response. "Trying to put all of this stuff
in the trash bag and find this picture that probably
a grandchild drew for her, it was so sad that I had to
throw it away in the trash,” Brooks said. “And then,
when we were done, we’d gutted the whole thing,
and it was a skeleton ofa house. She walked in the
front door and just looked in. I saw her face and it
was so sad, all her life, all her possessions were just
gone and in a pile by the street."

The group stayed in a church retreat center in
Mobile, Ala, and traveled an hour and a half each
day to their work site in Goshen, Miss. The group's
primary activity was called mucking, which refers to
gutting houses damaged by ﬂoods.

The winds from Hurricane Katrina pushed as
much as 15 feet ofwater through houses in the area
and then retreated, leaving the house and everything
in it soaked. The hurricane left a wet environment
in the houses that could easily mm to a source of
disease as clothes, food and drywall begin to decay,

“ltwe hadn't gone in, everything on the ground
would rot, and that's a breeding ground for diseases,“
Wilson said. “So, even if you hypothetically could
wash out a shirt and save it, it’s like ‘this is really
moldy and it has mud in it and sewage’ and you don’t
know. Everything smelled really bad. It’s not some—
thing you want to pick through really."

One additional group led by Lauren Standifot
’07 and Nissa Mattson ’07 traveled to Milwaukee,
Wise. to work on an organic farm called Growing
Power.

AltrBreak hopes to send groups to continue to
help with hurricane relief both for the winter and
spring break trips, now that the group has estab
lished connections in the area, it should be fairly
easy to organize successive trips, Banchy said.

Volunteers talked with victims of the hurricane
and learn which efforts were useful and which were
not One woman, displaced from her home, told
volunteers that the most useful donation was money,
since she has nowhere to store things because in ad
dition to homes, storage areas were blown away

volunteers also witnesscd the enduring hope of
many Victims. “There was an old woman there, in
her FEMA trailer, hel husband was in the hospital,
scveiely sick and her house, she's lived in it for 30*
something years, was all being thrown out, and she
was cheerful," Fokharel said. “She could see what
she had remaining, she could see what she had left
and there were [tough] moments, bur she wasn't

breaking dDWn."
