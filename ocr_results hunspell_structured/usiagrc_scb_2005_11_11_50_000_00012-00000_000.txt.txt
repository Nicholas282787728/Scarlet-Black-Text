BY KEVIN BYRNE

In a game with last second momentum shifts, in»
spired play and controversial calls, the Grinnell root
ball team fell to the visiting Carroll College Pioneers
4220.

Carroll College, ranked in the top third of the
Midwest conference. was expected [0 run and pass
all over Grinnell, but 1 few big plays from the Pios
neer side kept this contest close through much of the
gamer

"Our guys played hard from
the first snap to the last snap ofthe
game," said defensive coordinator
Tim Hollibaugh. “That is some-
thing we are proud of as a coach
ing staff. We always feel we can
come back in any game no matter
the score. The effort is there, no
question, we are just beat up physis
Cally."

Despite having a roster half the
size of entails, the Pioneers answered many of the
challenges they faced last Saturday

Carroll dented the scoreboard ﬁrst, with a 21 yard
touchdown run by tailback Blyce Crocker with 7:13
minutes left in the first quarter. Grinnells kickoffre-
ttirncr Kyle Petiy '03 answered back, returning the
iesulring kickoff 82 yards for a touchdown, tying the
game 7»7 in the fit-st quartcrr

Grinnell struck again early in the second quarter
when quarterback Sean Pfalzet '07 connected with
Marcus Plouzek ’09 for a 10-yard touchdown pass.
Carroll answered immediately, scoring on its next
three possessions during the second quarter to take a
28—14 lead at halftime.

“I feel like the offense was really starting to get
going after Marcus Plouzeks touchdown said Pfalr
zei- Unfortunately, losing him to a concussion on the
next possession and having others become limited by
injuries prevented us from sustaining an offensive ate
tack throughout the game."

Carroll came out stiong after halftime. They
scored two touchdowns in the third quarter- by capi-
talizing on their ball control and taking advantage of
some questionable officiating.

Grinnell posted a touchdown
in the fourth quarter on a 10-yard
pass from Pfalzcr to Lance Burks

“We really have to step up against Beloit and stop
the iun because they are mainly a running team ”said
seliloi linebacker Leo Martin.‘ Theii offense is a bit
confusing so we have to watch lots offilm in order to
understand what is going on, If we force Beloit to pass

knocking them offin my last game as a senior”

Grinnell men’s basketball: Winter preview

BV BROCK WEBB

The Grinnell men’s basketball team
has several reasons to look forward to
this season. A new court, an energetic
team and a supportive fan base are a
recipe for Successt

The Pioneers are gearing up, ptaCt
ticing hard and working on important
strategies to prepare for the rapidly ap-
proaching basketball season

The basketball team trained during
the spring and the summer before be-
ginning full practices, six days a week,
in midsOctoberr

The new Darby Gym, which will
set the stage for every home basketball
game, is ready for the entire season

However, despite the large number
of positive changes the Pioneers will
experience this season, there is still a
chance the season could go against the

basketball team.

Last year, the team played its first
13 games on the road because the new
Darby gym was still under construct
tron.

Head Coach David Arseneault be—
lieves that being
able to play a (0*
tal of 14 games at
home will give the
Pioneers a palpable
advantage this seat
son.

“It will be ti
little easier to get
the shooting strokes of our key players
intact earlier in our season,"Arseneault
said

The Pioneers will open the season
with eight consecutive home games.
This is beneﬁcial for several reasons.

”Our home crowd usual/y arts
as our Sixth man’and real/y gels
our group energized"

David Arsenealllt, Head Coach

The team will be well rested for
the home games, they won't need to
travel and they will be on a familiar
court

The largest advantage the baskets
ball team will have at home are‘ the
fans, whose energy
adds excitement, dra-
ma and intensity to
every sport, including
basketball.

“Ourhome crowd
usually acts as our
‘sixth man’ and really
gets our group ener-
gieed,"Arseneaiilt said

Arsenault believes that the team
will have the opportunity to build
confidence while playing at home.
which will give them greater prowess,
energy and ability during the away

games in the season.

This skill is an essential part of the
team’s strategy Although the Pioneers
are neither the tallest not the strongest
team in the conference, Arseneault has
put the Pioneer's strengths, speed and
accuracy, into the foreground, with
what he calls “the System.”

The major strategy is to utilize
space on the court and shoot distance
shots rather than potentially being on?
classed within the free throw zone.

This atypical strategy also gives
each individual basketball game its own
appeal.

"On any particular night, we just
may do something that has never been
accomplished at any playing level," Arr
seneairlr said. “Every game is an oppots
tunity to set a national record in one
area or another,"

The Grinnell men and women's
swimming and diving teams me look
ing to get back into shape for the up—
coming season to defend their ch
championship (lflcst

The Pioneers will need to make up
for lost time as they plunge into the
season. Grinnell begins practice later
than most of the other squads iii the
conference because of fall break. As the
time trials revealed last Saturday, the
team has ti long way to go.

“Some people are in great shape,"

said coach Erin Hurley. “But we (left
nitely have wink to do. "

On the men’s team, the loss of four
conference champions, Brett McMillan
’05, Braden Pence '05, Gene Petersen
’05 and Derryl Neufeld ’05, will cert
tainly be felt. -

“We graduated the best senior class
in my time here last year," said Hurley.
“This year won't be quite as strong.”

The team will be led by three»time,
looameter freestyle conference cham-
pion Peter Brown '06, Returning dis-
tance swimmer Eric Thumma ’08 is
also in great shape. He is expected to

lead the team in the 500*, 1000— and
léSO-metct freestyle.

Robbie Dewhurst 05 is also expect-
ed to make waves in the breaststroke
and the individual medley.

On the women's side, the team will
be competing without two oftheir con-
ference champions, Julia McHiigh '07
and Erinn Ctoco '07, who are abroad
until the spring semester.

In the meantime, the team will be
looking to performances from Amanda
Keledjian ’08, Lucy McCormick '06
and Lauren Gebauer '07.

Coach Ray Oberiniller will be
coaching this years diver-s. All Ameri-
can Sarah stayer co, the top ivomeas
diver who placed seventh on the 1 met
ter springboard and 15th on the 3 me—
ter springboard in nationals last year, is
currently recovering from a torn A.C,L.
It is not known when she will return.

Men’s co»capti\in Daniel Shyrock
’06 will be defending his conference ti»
ties in the 1, and Ssmeter springboard.

The swimmers and divers begin
