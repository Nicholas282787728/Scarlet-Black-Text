To the Editor:

You have suffered In a landmark deci
sion, the SGA council has decided to not
condemn the bombing of a Korean jet off
the coast of the Sov J Union. What were
the reasons for this decision? 1) What will
the decision do'7 2) It is not our respon-
sibillty. 3) We do not represent the opi-
nions oi the student body. And. by God, 4)
why should we care!

These and many other reasons were
given to refute the bill, but these were the
main ones, the ones that people actually
had to discuss. They can‘t see! They can't
see that they are all individuals, each per7
sonally voting agalnst condemnation. How
many or them, proclaiming that they did
not represent the students, actually went
and interviewed their constituencyl How
many people remember their presidents
asking them how they ieel?”

“What will it do?” they asked I ask,
“What will it not do?” These people have
made us all suffer, for they have turned
the SGA into not the government that it
once was, proclaiming its rabid hatred of
loreign wars and policies in the sixties, but
into nothing more than a corporation for
dispensing money. I'm for a change, are
you? — David Kopclmaii

To the Editor:

Every weekend this semester, Grinnell
College has provided [or at least three
movies and one live concert. Over the
years these weekly events have become a
tradition, and money to fund Such events
has come from SGA. This semester, con
certs chair Dan Klatz has been allotted
over $15,000 to bring live music to Grinnell
7 a generous sum in terms or SGA capaclr
ty, but not a lot in a world where live music
is an expensive proposition.

Yet these days money is tight, and
budgets are apt to be exceeded. At this
Wednesday's Jomt Board meeting, Dan
asked son lor even more money, explain-
ing that he had booked a band for an all~
campus parly this semester, and had over
shot his budget by slow,

Further, Dan explained that ii scia does
not give him die extra money 7 a likely
outcome given a budget that already had
to be cut due to declining enrollment 7 the
result would be cheaper bands and lower
quality music tor much of the remaining
semester.

But does the campus community need or
in any way require a concert every
weekend? Must quanty be compromised
for quality? Dan apparently thinks so and
is very unwilling to alter this weekly
“Grinnell tradition." Ask some people,
Dan, and you’ll probably rind that most
would rather see one expensive, high
calibre (although the two don't always go
hand in hand) concert every month than

three or (our weekly experiences like Cool
It Reba,

Change your priorities irom frequency
to quality, and let biweekly concerts
become something to look forward to.
More people will be satisrfled by this
realistic approach to live entertainment,
and you won't reel obligated to operate
beyond your economic means 7 David
Lilieuslein

To the Editor:

At last your newspaper directs notice to
the outstanding athletic accomplishments
of Veronika Platzer (Sept. 9) and what is
the result? An article ruined by faulty
reporting, discreditlng the entire effort as
well as casting doubt upon anything else
your newspaper reports.

The concluding sentence oi the iirsl
paragraph reveals, “Veronika qualified
for nationals in track and field and placed
let out at 75 in the Shotput,” Contrary to
your reporter’s undeniably well research
ed information, Ms. Platzer ﬁnished third
in the shotput at the national meet, breaks
ing the Division III record in the event durr
ing the competition, as well as capturing
the silver medal (that's second place) in
the discus. As Grinnell's one person team,
Platzer, from the point totals accumulated
lroni her placings in the shutout and
discus, placed let out oi 75 in the team
competition Oh, [see the mix-up How in7
advertent. This inadvertency, caused by
sloppy, inacurrate reporting, victimizes
Platzer’s achievements.

The real victims. however, are your en-
tire reading audience. No article that you
print can be read without suspicion as to
what the true facts are, and although the
gross reporting error was confined to
“just” the spurts, the suspicion generated
by it permeates the entire newspaper The
injustice caused by the flagrant error oi
your reporter demands an apology to both
Veronika Platzer and your reading aus
dience. But the real damage remains as
such and no apology can dispense of it. —
Written without the prior knowledge or
pi mpting or Veronika Platzer, Jim
Robinson
