Protest Needed More Order

Students unquestionably had the right to demonstrate against Iowa
Govcmor Terry Branstad‘s stances on various political issues. The
student protest that occurred when Branstad came to speak was remarkably
well organized. Branstad made his speech and answered questions
withoutbeing disturbed by the demonstrators. a greataccomplishment of
the organizers. Had there not been a formal demonstration, some
individuals would certainly have attempted to interrupt the speech.

What occurred following the govemor’s speech. however, must be called into question. The limits of
political free speech do not end at the boundaries of this campus, but this does not excuse the participants for
the immature, disorganized chase which rapidly deteriorated into chaos. This should have been controlled with
better planning and consideration. A demonstration without order is nothing more than a riot.

The breaking of the window at the Poweshiek County Republican Headquarters was accidental. Nonetheless,
it could have been prevented.

In addition, the student demonstrators failed to consider the far»reaching consequences of their impromptu
march into town. The signiﬁcant lack ofgood townrcollege relations may notbe entirelyjustilied, butevtdently
no one thought of this problem when they commenced their vocal protest of the governor.

Auto Dealer's Petty Attack
Merits Community Response

The decision by local auto dealer Wes Finch to rescind his offer of an
automobile for the Community Service Center (CSC) because of the
student demonstration against Governor Terry Branstad is outrageous.

This petty and vindictive act will not silence political statements from
this college‘s students. It will only punish an organization that was in no
way responsible for the demonstration.

The CSC is an excellent opportunity for students to interact with the residents of Grinnell. The programs it
organizes beneﬁt not only the students who panicipate, but also those members of the community helped by the
activities. Taking away the car thatis used by the CSC will hurt these individuals, as well as weaken one of the
best avenues for dialogue between students and townspeople.

By politicizing his donation, Finch is acting in a capricous manner that should not be accepted by the
members oftheGrtnnell community. Since Finch benefits from thiscommunity notonly from car sales,but from
service and repairs, the community should hold him accountable for his action. Therefore, the Scarlel nndBlack
staff recommends that students, faculty, staff, and adminstrators support a boycott of Finch’s business until he
reconsiders his vindictive act.

S&B Exclusion from Rally Improper

Readers may notice that this issue of the ScarlemndBlackcontains very
littlecoverage of Monday night's Take Back the Night rally. The reason
that there is only a photogmph on page 4 is not due to carelessness on the
part of this staff, but rather due to a request from the organizers that all
members of the media leave‘ [or a portion of the event.

Ratherthan createaconﬂictattheevent. thereportercompliod with the
request But, a decision was made by the editors that if the newspaper cannot present complete coverage of an
event due to intentional exclusion, partial coverage is not suitable. The Scarlet and Black cannot and will not
allow its coverage to be manipulated.

The reporter covering the event was informed that the request was made to protect the confidentiality of the
speakers, who were telling personal stories of assault and rape. Retelling such stories is an act of enormous
courage that should be universally supported. However, given that the event was public, it should be left to the
discretion of the media to determine confidentiality.

Any student or member of the Grinnell College and town communities could have entered South Lounge on
Monday night. As the reporter waited outside the lounge, a number of people walked in and out of the room.
There is no excuse for such an auempt to exclude a speciﬁc segment of this community.

In addition, the request has set a terrible precedent. If this event's organizers can exclude the press from a
public meeting, how can other groups be prevented from doing the same?

Grinnell has beneﬁted from its openness. All campus groups are open to the entire student body. Attempts
to bar students from any public activity is repugnant, no matter how personal or political the activtty may be.

Regardless of the cause, and cenainly Take Back the Night is a noble cause deserving support, the exclusion
of the media from events or portions of public events is not acceptable. The Scarlet and Black has the right to
cover any public activity, and will not allow that right to be compromised.

Students Living Up
to Grinnell Stereotype

To the editor.

Fashion liberals,rich kids widl a
cause,knee»jerk liberals. . . These
are labels frequently used to
describe the stereotypical Grinnell
College student. Lately, these have
been a fairly accurate assessment
of the typical student. We have
been supporting trendy causes
without fully understanding them
oropeningourmindstotheideasof
others.

For instance, the Grinnell
Community to End Homophobia
passed out pink ribbons to
support National Coming Out
Day. While the issue was real
and the support needed, this
campus turned the day into one
in which the individual was
judged by whether or not he or
she wore a ribbon. Some of my
friends and I were approached
repeatedly because we were not
wearing pink ribbons and were
wronglyaccusedofbeinganti-gay/
lesbian. This peer pressure
undoubtedly forced many to wear
the ribbons for the purpose of
conformity. instead of signifying
support for National Coming Out
Day, these pink ribbons became a
show of one‘s support for the
fashionable cause ofthe week, and
muswearingonemeantacceptance

on campus.

GovemorTerryBranstad‘svisit
to campus was another excuse
for students to resemble our
stereotype. Before the rally, signs
advertised “BE HIP! Protest
Governor Branstad!” Were you
hipl7! 1 attended to hear what
the governor had to say. While
his views are not always consistent
with my own, I felt it necessary
to at least hear explanations of
his positions on certain issues.
For the most part, students were
couneous.

Yet after the govemor‘s speech.
the atmosphere changed. As
students began to leave, we were
restrained by pro-choice protesters
locking arms. They wereagroup of
students protesting for rights, yet
my right to leave was physically
taken away. Does this sound
hypocritical to you too?

Please, Grinnell students. try to
look at all issues fairly. Then when
you have chosen your stance on the
issue, pursue this end earnestly
whilerespectingtherightsofothers.
I believe that Grinnell College can
become known as the school with
dedicated and progressive students
rather that “Camp Grinnell for rich
kids With a cause."
