Due to an unfortunate error ontue
part of Northwestern university, d‘ -
covered just this week, Grinncll was
asked to change the choice of the play
“The Valiaiiti' 10 he entered in the
university Theatre contest in Chicago
April 21 to 2 Grinuell refuses to
enter the tournament unless allowed
to proceed with “The Valiant," it was
stated this morning.

Consequently the decision of the
judges in regard to tiie casts appear--
ing in the two plays presented last
night in the A. R . auditorium is
more in the nature of an opinion oi
only last night's performance, it was
said. The decision was very close in
most instances, particularly in the
important roles, in which the final
tentative selection was made by a
very slight margin. '

Intuit Has Edge

Thuugh Kenelick gave evidence of
more studied technique and ﬁnish,
still infelt had a spontaneity and
Warmth which, though perhaps lortuit-
ous, was in the opinion of the judges,
a more satisfying interpretation of
the part. The following others were
given a. slight preference by the
judges: Russell Gray, William Miller,
Hope Huston, and Theodore Peterson.
for the parts respectively of lVardeu,
Chaplain, the Girl and the Jailer. The
Vote of the audience was Gray, \Vahle-
much, Kenefick, Peterson and Huston.

Elle Review

The iollowing review was written
before the _ above announcements
‘Were made: , '

"The Valiant," by Holworthy Hall
and Robert lfiddlemass, is a one act
drama of unusual power. In its high
emotional intensity "The Valiant" of.
fered easily situations which would
have fended themselves readily to
nverdramatie representation, but the
acting of both casts was characterized
by fine restraint, Appearing at an
advantage the first cast, Paul Kene-
rich, as Dyke, Louise Barton, as the
Girl, Russell Gray, 0thmer Wohlge-
ninth, and Ted Peterson held ‘their
audience to good attention. The sec-
ond group, with James lhfeit as Dyke,
Hope Boston, the Girl, Paul Kiesel,
the Warden, William Miller, the
priest, and Ted Peterson again as the
jailer, played to a disadvantage dur-
,ing the preliminary moments, but
held the audience's attention equally
well in the climax.

Paul Keneflck, playing the part of
a murderer condemned to hang who
steadily refuses to revel his true
identity, skillfully threw himself iue
to the role of a convict and depicted
his character with admirable repres—
sion. Particularly in the latter part
of the play was he completely in his
character and lived the sacrifice of
a man who will not permit his fam-
ily to share his disgrace. Louise Bar-
ton, is the girl, played with real
charm. warden Holt, played in this
cast by Russell Gray, was dcpendahly
characterized, while othmer \Vohlger
muth nsKFather Daly both looked and
acted his character. Particularly in
gesture, in which both rolcs demanded
characteristics of older men, these
two were very successful. Both, how.
ever, exhibited a slight dcclamatoi-y
tendency, and did not quite achieve
the conversational intimacy which
their relation called for. Ted Petcrr
son as the jailer in both casts play~
ed a minor role with unobtrusive
fidelity to character.

It was the note of unity which the
second cast Struck with more Skill.

HAHVAHI] SPEAKERS

Brynnites and Menckenites Cross
0n Puritanism, Declares
Prof, R, 13. Perry.

To Remain Hell llnt Mnn’lll i

Moderns Examine Body As Purl
tans Inspected Soul In Time
Of Mayflower.

The Puritan of old went in [or mor-
al training and record breaking as
earnestly as the athlete of today, said
I’l'ol‘. Ralph liartoii Perry, Harvard

cliangc lecturer, in his address on

ilic Puritan, a Moral Athlete,” 'yeSr
; morning in Herrick chapel.

The speaker was introduced by
President Main. The Harvard ex
change lectures will cover a period of
about a month, the next one being on
Tuesday.

“Purltclnislu was not absurd, it can
be made absurd. It was not hole
and complete. it was ignorah of
the great chapters of human exper-
icnce A twentieth century Puritan
is diﬂel'ellt from the seventeenth cen-
tury Puritans."

Mr. Perry spoke of the two 'iol'ces
working today; the Menckenites who
are opposed to Pu tanism and the
Bl'yztlliles who are its present day ex-
ponents. in his opinion it took a gen-
ius‘ to be on the fence between two
such factions as these.

Reform 1s strong

“There is no single idea or impulse
which can be said ‘53 be the essence
of Puritanism; the impulse to reform
one's neighbor or the View of wealth,
as virtue. ‘

“The eighteenth century Puritan
was anxious about the state of his
soul. This took the form of -ireduent
inspections." These inner inspections
the speaker compared to the present
day medical examinations.

“The Puritan was prepetually trying
out his moral will. It is characteristic
hi the Puritan that he is preoccupied
with the state of the soill. The good
man possesses a fund of energywhich
would aid him to over-come evilJU
Citing Bunyan, Prof. Perry told of the
uncertainty of reaching heaven be-
cause this author said that one could
fall from its gates to hell.

Virtue Scarred by Battle

"Virtue bears the scars of battle.
Virtue implies a will than is never
wholly given to life. The Puritan
did not accept the past records as .1.
criterion of his virtue but set out to
make records. He went at this as '
flaming youth goes out to excel in
sport. ,

"Jonathan Edwards went into train-
ing himself in dogmaism," the speak~
er said that because of this intensive
training the Puritan went . through
has opened him to criticism by those
who do not have the time to take
morality so seriously. “The Puritan
held that morals were more important
than athletics and business. Moral
perfection was considered more nec- ,
cssary that excellence in sports busi-
ness or arts.

“No one supposes that any really
great Pur’itau really went about out-
wardly professing morality when he
did not do so inwardly. The Puritan
believed himself to be called but he
wits- not sure so he would wavel- be-
tween the heights or hope and the,
depths of despair

“When it man is tempted to call his
neighbor it hypocrite let him examine
his purpose and see if he is not ack~
nowledging the superiority of his
neighbor and trying to lower him to
his own level,

"Virtue is virtue so long as it Yields
good. The good lite ls founded on
virtue.” Mr. Perry Spoke at some
length on the idea of virtue applied to
Puritan thought and concluded by
saving.

“Furllan truth is not the Whole
truth. Purltanlsm is not the end but
it is the beginning. The way to hu-
man perfection is first through the
creation of a. Will and then What that
will creates."
