The fantasy of watching your peers do
something and thinking “Hey,I can do that"
rarely turns outwell. This week's bright idea:
“Maybe I can play water polo with the dos
fending national runners-up and not make a
fool of myself."

wrong! Accompanied by my equally
nervous colleague john Francis Buse, the
SEE} assistant news editor, we subjected
ourselves to the Wild Turkeys practice on
Tuesday ahead oftheir weekend tournament
at Obermiller Pool.

We were out orour league before we even
jumped in the Water. Iexamined rhe list of
weaknesses from last weekend’s tournament,
things like: movement, team defense, picks,
counters (against Division 1 teams, mind
you), concluding that it would be a resound-
ing success ifI were to remember any one of
them. More offrputting was the realization
that in a room full or Speedos, the baggy
btown—with—palms and electriCrbluerwithr
ﬂowers swimsuits that Johnny and I wore
gave oft’a distinctly amateur vibe.

But we kept up hope by surviving rhe
ﬁrst 45 minutes of practice, also known as
the “raise sense or security period," where
completing drills without swallowing water
almost convinced us that we could do this.
Halfway through practice, I could kind of
shoot, kind of pass, and kind of tread water
in the counterintuitive eggbeater method,
which involved rotating your legs in appo-
site directions to stay aﬂoat with minimum
energy use.

I trusted corcaptain/instructor Matt
Hochstein ’09 when he said it worked, but
he forgot to tell me that it requires all of
my mental capacity to pull off. I opt for the

scissor kick.

Even my warmup for the ensuing scrim-
mage was troubling. lust four shots into my
career as a goalie, my calrsepararod from rho
rest or my body. “Charley Horset'a number
ofplayers said, perhaps expecting this. Eight
to ten expletives later, Hochstein thankfully
reminded me to stretch.

The scrimmage that took place after
warmup was even more eye opening, mostly
because of the constant swimming. Every
change or possession forced another 25-mer
ter sprint. More than once, our teammates
scored on a rest break before Johnny or l
reached half court. I think they let me get
open for a shot (missed), but otherwise we
did little.

“I can’t swim, so that aspect is totally difr
ferent,"said water polo player Hugh Redford
‘10, playing a supporting role tor me as one
of the few team members who doesn't swim
competitively. “There’s no way to equate the
difference between that and running."

Probably out of sheer kindness, Johnny
and I avoided the most integral aspect of a
water polo match: violence. Think ofyour-
selr treading water, then think or any act or
violence you could commit below the surface
that would slow down your opponent—it’s
probably legal. Keeping gentleman’s honor,
everyone I talked to denied that they would
strike ﬁrst, but everyone would eagerly res
taliate, smiling as they said it.

In a sense, this overwhelming feeling of
competitive machismo is the driving force
behind why these guys keep jumping in the
pool, and why this irrational male still wants
to play long after proving himselfinept.

outside the pool, ask any of them for
stories, and they’ll regale you with cringe—

“My ribs hurt, I've never had my ribs hurr
before," said Pat Blachly ’09 recounting one
bout of postgame soreness.The mention of
rib injuries snowballed into ten minutes of
top-this stories unprintable in a newspaper.

When the only pause in the conversa~
tion was when Hochstein said, “I'm trying
to think of some quotes you could print," I

realized they might be a little obsessed.

But they have the right to be. While
every sport involves a battle to ﬁnd a way
to best your opponents, most of them don’t
require you to swim a mile and a half, face
shots that could reach 55 mph, tread water,
and elude an equally obsessed opponent that
might rip offyour nipples (or worse.) Some-
how, though,1 still want to get back into the
pool. The prototypical male never learns.
