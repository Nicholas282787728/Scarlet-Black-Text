Over Lair an nail in Ennis of
eri-n'll l’l'ize Debate.

Jolm Pierson and Emerson Schill‘,
representing Building Four, triumphe
ed or-cr- Walter Luridberg and laur-
cnce Pedel‘son, of Langan hall, in the
final round of the Moi-rill Prize de-
bate held in l-icrrick chapel last Tuess
day night by a decision of a to 0. As
a result the $40 prize will be awarded
to Building Four, while 010 each will
be given to Laiigau ball and Smith
hall, second and- tbird’ respectively
In the so Cs.

The deci e vote of the judges,
Prof. H. W. Norris, Prof, C. N. smiley,
and H. W. Harriman, on thc question
of the debate, Resolved, That the army
and navy air forces should be com-
bined in one department under a sep:
arate cabinet secretary, should not
indicate that the contest was a one-
sidcd affair.

Laugan hall displayed some good
argumentation, but both sides were at
sea a share of the time. The neg-
ative won because of the fact that
the affirmative failed to frilly estab-
lish the superio 'ty of a separate de—
partment of air over the present sys-
tem of having the air forces under
the two heads of the army and navy
as an auxiliary to those br-anchcs of
the nation's defense.

C h liconi is Chairman

\l'. Earl Becm, debate coach arid one
of the founders of the Grinnell For-
ensic, the organization sponsoring the
debate. introduced the speakers.

This contest was the culmination of
a series of debatcs among the men's
halls for the hlcrrill prize. The first
round began on Not/embel- 10,

Walter Lunberg as the first speaker
for the affirmative rather bombastic-
nlly proclaimed that the present sys-
tem of air administration is inade-
(mate and decentralized. He cited the
Shenandoah incident as an example
of the liarmiul jealousy that exisits
between the army and navy officials,
who. he said. knew nothing about
flying. He made the statement that
the air force is the most formidable
wenpou e, istcnt.

Defends Present System

John Pierson, representing the, neg-
ative, defended the present system,
claiming that the air force is iiot
large or important enough to war-
innt the expansion necessary under
the new plan of a separate depart-
ment, “Why not have a department
of entomology?” be asked in proving
his point, to be separated from the de-
partment of agriculture. Furthermore.
he said, it has not shown its ability
to operate separately.

Lawrence Pederson, closing the
constructive side of his case, attempts
ed to show that the/air force could be
placed under a separate department
and still cooperate with the army and
navy. He brought up the Cury bill
on this question, which will come
up before Congress next week. He
argued that the proposed plan would
eliminate the deficiencies in the pres-
cnt system. ‘

Emerson Schill, the concluding
speaker for the negative, pointed out
the evils that would result from tho
proposed plan which would be far
greater, he said, than those in the
present system. Decentralizationwas
the major evil.

’l‘hc rebuttal of both sides was 2»

r-eliashing of the constructive speech-
es and an attempt to decide just what
schould be included in the question.

Investigation Rouses
Mob Against Bradshaw

Professor ifariori J. Brad
former member of the Ci-runell lacs
ulty who is now teaching at the
Bangor Theological Senlillzu‘y',"l\l£line.
was recently tiireatencd by a mob
when he investigated a soscztllcd
"healer."

A woman evangelist was alleged to
have performed some ruiraculoiis
cures, and Bradshaw, being a psychol-
osist, was asked to conduct an inves-
tigation. ills iiiidinss were not favor—
able to the 'wouder woman" and she
returned to town and made her de~
fense before an audrncc of 3000 peo-
ple. She aroused their anger and suc-
ceeded in getting the mob to shout.
“Lot's go and get him." The mob did
not not however. .

Pl'olcssur Bradshaw was head of the
religious department at Grinnell for-
two years, but left this full for the
Bangor Seminary.

in a recent letter Mr. Bradshaw said.
"I feel something of a void in the
regions where i suspect my heart is.
Grinnell is so much alive. overflowing
with the best bunch of young people
alive, and even though a sister theo-
logical seminary of Bangor’s recently
rcceived a gift of about four million
dollars, most seminaries are quite
unlike Grinnell pep meetings."

Monday noon marked the beginning
of a new era in the history or the
men's (lining hall. At that time the
plan of the liousc chairmen, cosopcr-
ntiiig with Dean James F, Findlay.
for improving eating conditions among
the dormitory men, went into effect.

Members of each building are
gi-oupcd together at contiguous tar
lilcs, all of which are presided over
by two rillperclassiiien, who have been
selected by (L popular Vote of their
hall. Serving is (lone, both at noon
and night, by the heads of the tables,
and they are empowered to enforce

the rules which have been drawn up.l

In addition to the permanent heads,
there are likewise an equal number of
alternates, whose duty is to take
charge during the absence of their
superiors.

Tire men at each table are expected
to remain standing until all the men
eating at that particular table are
present, and in the evening the
men are supposed to leave by t -
blcs. Several minor rules of eti-
quette will also be enforced.

Dean Findlay has met with the mm
of each building, explained the pi —
posed plan to them, and secured their
cooperation in making the undertak—
ing it succcess. The waiters have als
so pledged their wholehearted assis—
tance and are working in harmony
with the heads of the tables.

The entire project has been framed
with the idea of promoting a stronger
“esprit de Corps” among the men of
Grinnell, and to make the dining hall
a source of pride to the college, to
make it a place to which guests can
be taken without apolgy. This aloha
ievement is part of a greater eiitc —
prise which looks toward the develon‘
merit in the dormitories of just such a
spirit as pervades the better class of
fraternities.
