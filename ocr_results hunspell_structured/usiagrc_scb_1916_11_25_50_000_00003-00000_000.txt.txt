Manager M. c. ci-utchiicld, oi the
Colonial, has a tow white rabbits
which he will sell cheep. In tact. he
might be induced to give them away
it properly urged. The rabbits, pure
white. plnk eyed. plump and saucy
rabbits. are a legacy from the recent
appearance here at the moving pic-
ture feature, “Civilizatiun.”

it will be recalled that in the pro-
logue of this production. in which real
actors tool: part. the rahhits appeared
on the stage and played an important
part in creating the illusion at peace
and happiness which the eoute t ea -
ed tor. it so happened that the “Civ -
izatioii" company broke up alter its
engagement here. it had made all the
larger cities. including Grinnell. and
the management had decided to dis-
pense with the living actors and the
orchestra and to present “Civilization”
lrom new on as a straight moving pic-
ture attraction in moving picture the
atcrs.

Hence the rabhits. They were lett
on Cl‘lltchfleld’s hands. Any one wish-
ing a troupe of highly trained, intelli-
gent rabbits. cultured and thoroughly
broken to “speak in public on the
stage,“ will do well to call on the
manager of the Colonial.
