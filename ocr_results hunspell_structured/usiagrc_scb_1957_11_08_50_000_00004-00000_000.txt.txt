A survey of the opinions of the women students on Grinncllwiilbe host to an Iowa,

prepping appeared in the October fourth edition of the Nebraska

Scarlet and Black. At that time, it was said that a later
poll would attempt to gauge the final opinions of the W0-
men at the conclusion of the 1957 prepping season. The fol-

lowing study is the result of

The first poll, circulated im-
mediately after the League
Board first announced its plans
for the current prepping season,
was intended to study initial re-
actions to such actions as the
elimination of dress»up days,
goody boxes, bookstore singing
and individual blacklisting from
the program. At the same time,
the board announced the acidic
tion of hail blacklist'mg, raids,
and talent shows. Prepping was
to be concluded with a ”Hell
clay," followed by an allrQuad
party at which ohe hall with the
least number of blacklists per
girl was to be rewarded.

Opinion Changes Markedly

This week’s poll showed mark-
ed changes from the earlier
study. Trends which were slight
ly indicated in October now are
clear and distinct.

One of the most discussed
changes in the program for
freshmen was the reduction of
the “nights out” rule. Previous~
ly. women were allowed out of
the dorm on only two week
nights per school week. This
was changed to allow every
freshman woman a “free period"
from lo to 10:30 p.m. every
night.

In the initial poll the fresh
man woman exprmed them-
selves as helm: unanimously

in favor of this move, and
70% of the upperclasswomen
supported it. The current study
indicates a change in attitude
for, while 35% of the fresh.
men favor free periods, as do
65% of upperclasswomen liv-
ing in integrated halls. only
23% of the upperclasswomen
in Loose and Hainos remain
in favor:
