are not at all satislactory now. a
part of this plan is being put into
operation this spring. The ground
has alrcady been broken for a new
and fairly elaborate bath house. This
in a, practical way will serve the pur-

new building will provide a place for
shower baths and the like, the lack

will also contain the laundry where
the boys wash their own clothes as 15‘
