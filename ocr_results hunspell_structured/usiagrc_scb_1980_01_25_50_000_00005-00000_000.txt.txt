SGA theft stymies police

by Winston Kreuier

Sometime during Christmas break,
one or more people burglarized and
vandalized the Student Government

‘ Association offices, stealing appI‘OX'
lmalely $80 in petty cash,

It is unclear how or when the break-
in occurred. There were no signs of
forced entry, which leads Dean of
Students Jim Tederman to speculate
that either a door was left open or the

personts) who committed the burglary
had a key. Since the offices were left
unattended tor a space of several
weeks, no definite time of the crime
can be determined.

SGA President David Kramer said
that whomever broke in went through
both the student Coordinator‘s and his
own office, and “...took out drawers
and went through papers leaving

everything in a total mass.”

While luggage, clothes, and some
blankets were being stored in the of-
lices, only a cash box containing petty
cash was stolen,

Although the crime was reported to
police, they have no suspects or leads,
Because of the uncertainties in the
case and lack of witnesses,Tederman
commented that “the police probably
never will have any suspects,”

Political interest may not be com—
pletely extinct at Grinncll, The student
turnout at last Monday's Democratic
caucus virtually dispelled any doubts
of rampant political apathy.

Grinnell College students comprised
the majority of the participants at the
Democratic party's precinct caucus
held ih South Lounge, ”I’ve never seen
students turn out for a political event
like this before," said Kevin Crim,
Assistant in the Writing Lab and
Chairman of the County Democratic
Central Committee.

Ten delegates were selected to at—
tend die Democratic county conven-
tion in Montezuma on March 8. Five of
the delegates are committed to Presi-
dent Carter, three to Senator Ken~
nedy, and two are uncommitted.

The county convention will elect
delegates to one of six district conven-
tions and the state convention. These
conventions will select 45 of Iowa's 50
delegates to the Democratic national
convention, while five places are
reserved for party and elected ol-
licials.

The delegate selection process af-

orded a unique and exciting oppor-
' 'pation. The voting

as divided into groups according to
residential preierence. The number
-f delegates each group could select

as proportional to its size in percen-
age terms. Each group elected
.elegates from its own members

support key to Carter victory

The delegates have several respnn- _

Sibilities at the county convention
“The most important thing there is
electing delegates to the district and
state conventions." Crim said, “We
will write a platform (or the county
Democratic party Also, we’ll elect
members to committees to organize
the district convention." he added,

About 35 students volunteered to at
tend the county convention as alter~
nates [or the delegates. State party
rules allow each precinct to select any
number of alternates. “The alternates
may participate in debate, " Crim
said. “They may get to vote," he add-
ed.

Walt Stone, Assistant Professor of
Political Science, suggested a possible
explanation fur the magnitude of stu—
dent participation. Perhaps students
reasoned that “if you’re going to vote
anywhere, the caucuses make more
sense, There are iewcr participants
than in the general election, so the in»
dividual‘s impact is larger,” he Said,

The reasons students gave for voting
centered on “a sense of duty" and
“just for the experience." “It's a right
that l have, livmg in the United
States. and it's my duty to exercise
that right," Mary Von Zellen said.
”I’m voting because I believe it‘s my
responsibility as a citizen,” Mark
Finkelstein said. “My vote doesn't
make a ditference,” Dave Blatt said,
“but I'm Voting for the lun Di itijust
to see what the caucuses are like."

The most highly involved studean
are Bill Stowe and Anne Woodley, the
leaders of the college’s Carter and
Kennedy campaigns, respectively. For
weeks, both have coordinated efforts

to drum up support by contacting
students and townspeople. “The real
trick is finding out who your sup-
porters are," Stowe said. “Our major
way was word of mouth. Friends and
classmates helped by asking around,”
he said.

Woodley played a significant part in
bringing Senator Kennedy to Grinnell
last November. She started writing,
requesting a visit, last August. She
made an additional appeal at his
Washington office over [all break.

Woodley feels that “the Kennedy
group on campus was an amorphous
group fluctuating from week to week,”
she said.

The Kennedy camp concentrated its
ellorts in town. “The United Auto
Workers worked a great deal in town
as did Bob Grey iAssociate-Proiessbr
of Political Science).” Woodley said.
The Kennedy campaign's state orhm
provided valuable assistance. “They
supplied us with advice, guidance. and
names and addresses of likely sup
porters,“ she said. Woodley expressed
some surprise at the large turnout.

Stowe was “assisted by about ten
dedicated students." The Carter
group‘s strategy was to concentrate on
the “rank and file Democrats in this
ward.” since “we didn't have the
union support,” Stowe explained.

Senator Kennedy's personal ap-
pearance in Grinnell, in Stuwe's opi-
nion, makes the Carter victory pro-
icund. “I'm particularly pleased
because Kennedy visited here, and yet
we carried this ward,” he said,
Woodley contends, however, that the
