THE SECOND TEAM.

 

The next game to be played on
the home grounds is on Thursday
Oct. nth, at 4, p. in, between the
“scrub” team 01 Iowa College and
Iowa Agricultural College. It will
be to the interest of all candidates
for second team honors to present
themselves regularly {or practice.
Altho lessthan one weelt before the
gamethe team is yet in a forma-
tive stage. Let it also be remem-
bered by all friends of toothall that
encouragement and ﬁnancial sup-
port in this game, frilly as much as
in any other, is to the interest of
,football in I. C. Altho not yet
ltleﬁuitcly arranged, it is the pup
pose of the football management
‘to have one more home game and
one out of town game for the sec-
ond team, II, 0, \ ll.|.»\l{li,

Yale playt-d Brown at New
lHaven, Oct. 3, and the game,
a remarkable one in srwtral re-
Ispects. Atterplaying one minute
Brown carried the ball to Yale's‘v
second yard line. Had it not been,
for the questionable decision oil
the referee, Brown might hare
.scored on the Blues, an event that
has not taken place [or three
years—a visiting eleven scoring a
touchdown on Yale. The other
feature of the match was the Inn»
tality with which the game was
played, Iiightmtn were rvmlerr
ednnconscions, and it “as the
1gvneral opinion that ii the revised
rules had brought about such a rt»

We are glad to see the increased
interest taken in tennis this fall.
There are now about twenty good
courts on the campus and these
are all kept busy, except on the
colder days. For those who have
neither the desire nor the ability to
play football, tennis furnishes an
exhilarating substitute without the
element of danger which is always
present in the football match. '
his is not a mild nor etieininate
form of exercise, and it is as much
to a man's credit to play a strong
game with the racquet, as to make
the eleven, or to be a member oi
the track team. The tennis asso-
ciation will be full in a week or so,
and systematic practice should be
commenced at once. Iowa Cole
logo will tit-ea iiii-ii to represent
her in singles and doubles in the
tournaments of the year, and there
is no reason why a winning,r team
should not be developed from the
abundance of good material that is
at hand.
