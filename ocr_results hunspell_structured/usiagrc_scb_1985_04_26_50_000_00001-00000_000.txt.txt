Students protest Grassley
vote for Contra aid

by Robert 0. Quashie

It made the Iowa television news. A
group oi students trom Grinnell oc-
cupied the Des Moines office of Senator
Charles Grassley (Rep), alter closing
hours to help punctuate some Iowans
disappointment with the senator‘s vote
on the proposed aid package tor the
Contras in Nicaragua,

The Grinnellians were part ot a day-
long protest oi CIA actions and Contra
aid held outside the Federal Building in
Des Moines.

What didn't make the broadcast T.V.
was the call from the Iowa Campaign to
Stop the War in Nicaragua, tor
Grassley to hold a public meeting in
Iowa to explain his vote alter he sent
letters to his constituents which implied
he would not support the package, The
letter stated that Grassley would not
support any measures to help over-
throw the government of Nicaragua or
any aid to terrorists in that country. A
Grassley aid in Washington justified his
vote over the phone to the protestors
saying that the senator saw :14 million
which was to channeled through the
CIA as “humanitarian.”

This measure and three others tailed
to pass the house on Wednesday.

The Iowa media also failed to men-

tion the testimony given by iormer CIA
agent Verne Lyon who took part in the
protest,

“You name it, we did it.” said Lyon
who spent eight years in Cuba. Central

,and South America as an undercover

agent. Lyon, who now heads the Des
Moines Hispanic Ministry said his main
purpose in Latin America was to under
mine civilian life. “What we were asked
to do was not in the interest of anyone,”
he said.

“We did things like contaminating
the milk supply [or school children in
Cuba Just to raise the irustration level
or the people with Castro. Use your im-
agination and you’re not far off. But I
feel much better about saving lives
rather than taking them,” Lynn said.

Also taking part in the protest were
various clergy, businesspeople and
farmers from the Des Momes area.

Most of the crowd left when it was
time to go back to work but the Grinnell
students went into the Ofﬁce of Grassley
and waited for the Senator to call
himself, This never happened.

The students held out past closing
hours until Grassley's top aid from
