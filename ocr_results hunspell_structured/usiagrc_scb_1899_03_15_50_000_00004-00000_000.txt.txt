The Glee Club Trip.

Since arrangements were made
for the annual Glee Club and
orchestra trip, several of the im-
portant members of the orchestra
have found that it will be impossi-
hlelor them to leave theirbusiness
interests for so many days. In
view of this and the fact that
there are two or three others for
whom it would be almost impos»
sible to go, the orchestra has de-
cided not to take their usual trip
with the Glee Club, but to conﬁne
themselves to concerts in neigh~
boring towns where their full
number can be represented. The
Glee Club will make the trip, as
sisted by Miss Rew,violinist; Miss
Smith, reader; Mr. Harris, whis-
tler; and Mr. Delavan, hornist.

The club will give seven eon.
certs on the'trip. Leaving Grinr
nell, Friday morning, March 24,
they will appear that evening be-
fore an audience in Cedar Falls.
At Waverly, they will give a con»
eert Saturday evening, remain
there over Sunday, and give Cone
certs at the following places the
next week: Osage, New Hamp
tort, Mason City, Aekley and
Hampton.
