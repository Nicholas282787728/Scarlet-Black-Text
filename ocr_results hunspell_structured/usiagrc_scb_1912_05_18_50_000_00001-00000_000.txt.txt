The third state college meet held on
Ward Field was won yesterday alter-
noon by Coe College with a total oi
331,5 points Morningside ranked sec-
ond with 2314 and Crinnell took third
honors with 20 counts. The day could
not have been better, the track and
ﬁeld were in splendid shape, the rec
ords as a whole were as good as will
be made at any meet in the middle
west and all Grinnslr was on hand to
make this the biggsest and best day oi‘
the year. The interest was intense,

comlortably, one new record was
made, another was tied and the meet.

Several Stars in Action.

Wilson, the speedy captain of the
Coe team, was the big attraction or the
day but the work of Durey, oi Des
Moines College, in the two long runs
ond or Stunkard in the hurdles, was
almost equally brilliant. Wilson had
things his own way in all three ol the
dashes but his records were not as
good as those he made last year.
Stunkard's lime in the high hurdles
tied the state i-ecoid held by Clow of
Grinnell, and in the low sticks lie cs

Small Bunch of Track Fans Have
Pep Demonstration in Gym
Thursday Evening.

A mass meeting to inspire enthusi-
asm tor the state meet was held in
the Men's Gym Thursday night. About
two hundred students were present
and seemed to enjoy the proceedings
immensely.

The syncopated yell-leading or the
elongated cheer-leader, “Dart" Russell
l'eatured the entertainment and was
(highly enjoyed by all those p'resent.

i After the crowd had sung "Boole,“
to the accompaniment ot the band and
the nervous baton oi the yell-roaster,
'Captain Dan-kins was called upon tor
a speech and responded with an earnest
plea for the support which the team
needed and deserved. Mr. Frye was
the next speaker to occupy the res
truni and he gave a tew excerpts irom
two hundred eight reasons why evci

had prepared. \Ylllimii Jennings

Militant Damsels Assert Rights in
Striking Manner a Convention
Deadlock Finally Broken With
Stampede to "Peerless Leader.”

The Democratic National Conven-
tion, staged in the Men‘s Gymnasium
last Wednesday night, was a grand and
glorious exhibition nt old time Demo-
cratic enthusiasm; and culminated, as
the wise ones had predicted, in a‘
stampede tor the Peerless Leader.

Tile chairman ot the National Com-
mittee called the convention to order
and introduecd Judge Wade, alias Har-
rison, as temporary chairman. The
Judge proved an eloquent orator rind
outlined the relative positions of the
two great parties with vigor. All the
speeches, considering their extemporan-
coils character, were extremely ﬁnent
and eltective, and the Republican party
was shaken "to its very bnlwal-ks and
utterniost ramiﬁcations," as Senator
Stone or Missouri thundered out in
the course of his nomination speech.

Suffragettes Invade Hall.

During the intermission while the
Committees were holding their ses
sions, the convention hall was invaded
by some hundrcds ot militant suiira-
gettes ullo took charge or things.
They staged seteral orators, among
them the aged Susan B. Anthony who
dealt with the siiliragette movement
i'ioin Eve down to modern times and
local conditions. After a wildly excit-
inc session eliminating in a ﬁght be-
tween rival leaders, the suttragettes
retired to the galleries.

Hon. Thos, Hopkins Taggart, permits
nent chairman, made a masterly ad-
dress and then called tor the report

‘ot the platt'oi-ni committee, given by

Senator Tillman. Then came the roll
or states ior nominations for the up
