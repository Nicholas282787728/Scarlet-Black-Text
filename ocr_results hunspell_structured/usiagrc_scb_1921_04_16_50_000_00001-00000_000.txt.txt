DRAKE RELAYS FIRST
CHANGE TO SEE TEAM'

Enter Two Short Relays and In
Special Dash at Annual
Relay Carnival.

Old Man Weather once more step-
ped in with its s 'ollg hand and put
an end to all plans for opening the
spring outdoor track season with the
sophsfl'esllmztll dual this afternoon, by
letting forth a torrent of rain for
about tweiitv»tliree out of the twent
four hours yesterday, and greetnig
Gl'illnell witlra white blanket of snow
which lasted all day today and nearly
resulted in a tieup of train service.
This is the third consecutive year that
the dual has had to be abandoned or
postponed on account of the refusal
of the weather man to sanction the
affair, but this year he seems to have
been determined to show his disap»
proval in a more forceful manner
than usual, by decrecing a veritable
blizzard, \\hll:h covered the streets
with from four to eight inches of
snow,

Use Indoor Trick

The dual will probably be called
off entirely now, it is thought. Try—
outs for the Drake relays will be held
sometime this week if weather ner-
niits, instead of holding them todny’.
Doc Hufl‘s track squad will have to
use the indoor path today and hope
for a week of fair weather in which
to put in the last efforts tor the Drake
Relays next Saturday.

Huff has run off both a heat of the
440 and 220 during the past week in
Wthh the men finished as follows;
220, Vinsel, Reece, Seariglit, Clsr In!
this race Panlu did not enter so it is
safe to say that the short relay will
be composed of the three of the above
men and Paulu, No time was given
out for the race.

Relay Entries Undecided

In the 440 tryout the men placed in
the following order Reece, Bryan,
Cushmon, Seariglit, and Van Her
The time was also withheld on this
But Reece won the dash hand-
ily,

Coach Huff said that as yet he had
not attempted to name the men who
were to compete at Drake and that he
probably will have other tryouts dur-
ing the coming week before he makes
his final decision. The only sure en-
try to date is Paul“ in the special 100
yd. dash.

Reports from Drake have it that
the secretary of the Des Memes
Chamber of commerce is making ev-
ery effort in the world to have Pad-
dock stop at Des Moines on his way
to the Penn relays and compete in
the special dash at Drake. 1f Pad»
dock do‘es enter, the special 100 will
contain not only the best in the mid-
dle west but it will be close to one
of the fastest fields ever assembled

F. Aluly, head of the Poll'eslllek coun»

the Grinncll town campaign is going

local campaign now stands at approx-
imately $73,000 towards the total
pledges of $1 mood, and only the busi-
ness men of the downtown district
have been seen. President C. 5.
George, of the Commercial chili was
out at the city today, and plans for
future work could not be learned. It
is understood that he has something
up his sleeve to propose when he re—
turns.

The campaign in D Monies has
made considerable lieadi y, if infor»

taken as sutlientic. The committee
and progressive form of canvassing
has been in use there ,aiid although
not a great number of pledges have
been handed in, the managei are
taking their time and seeing everyone.
The amounts of die pledges in Des
Moines have been higher than in any
other city, according to Professor
This is due to the fact that
managers have been careful not to
skim over the top and be satisfied
with any amount.

A recent meeting in Des Moines

A general letter has been sent by

This will be followed in a week or
two with a letter from the class pr s-

presidents are voluntarily taking

their respective classes. ‘Ward Macy.

The Grim-lei] and You bulletin has

The total illnom'lt raised in the cam—

BLAIM AHT EXHIBIT
IS BEﬂ YEARS,

Lincoln Art Company Brings Big
Collection of Original
Pictmes,

FACULTY MEMBERS T0 ‘
LECTURE AFTERNOONS

The Lincoln Fine Arts exhibit of
original paintings and etchings, which
opened today in the Rand gymnasium
has been pronounced one of the best
exhibits brought to Griniiell by this
company for some time. Over two
hundred pictures of various kinds are
in the collection, and it is thought that
the fact that Crmnell has had so
many relations with the Lincoln com-
pany in the past is responsible for the
standard of pictures scnt.

The exhibit is being sponsored this
year by Cap and Gown society, and
proceeds from adnii ion charges will
go to the endowment fund, it is an~
nounecd. A number of speakers will
lecture on art during the period of the
exhibit, Professor Caroline Sheldon
spoke this afteinoon, with ”Open
F '25" as her topic. Prof. C, F. La»
vell will speak tomorrow afternoon
at three O‘clock. and Monday after-
noon at four o’clock Professor Clara
Miller-d sinertenko will lecture on
some of the individual pictures of the
collection.

A number of especially fine etch—
ings in colors, and a number of orig»
inal watercolors, besides a number of
reproductions of high class attracted
much attention this afternoon. All
of the pictures in the collection are
for sale. A great deal of interest has
been aroused at the Quadrangle by
the announcement that two pictures
will be purchased by the Women’s
League Board for presentation to the
two cottages selling the largest num—
ber of tickets to the exhibit. The an»
nounceincnt was made last year that
the pictures would be awarded, but
niitil this year no scheme was devised
as to which cottages should receive
the pictures.

Tea will be served i nth'e after-
noon by tlie pationesses of Cap and
Gown, and there will.bc music during
the afternoons and evenings.

fﬂﬂUNGlLﬂﬂMMIlTEE

ﬂHﬂANllelﬂN PLAN

Many New Features to Be Brought
._ Out When Council Hears
Report Monday.

CHANGE omsENTA-
TION IS MOST IMPORTANT

Reorganization to Include Whole
Student Government System
Is Thought.

Plans
lion all

for the complete reorganiza-
tlie student council and the
strident government system on the
campus will be presented to the stud-
ciit council Monday by the committee
from that body appointed before
spring vacation to draw up plans for
a new organization, The committee
is heedcd by Ruth Condon, '21, and
includes the following members of the
council: Willis Macy, '23, Harry
Flynn, '23, Adelaide Sibley, '21.

Little could be learned this morn—
ing about the plan to be presented
except that it will include the men's
senate and the women's league board
in its operation, and may even pro»
vide for slight changes in the two
bodies.

To Change lieprcsciitntian

The matters of Tepl'esEnmtion from
classes and organizations are known
to have been given special attention.
Miss Condon said today that commit-
tee menlbel's were agreed that the
present form of representation did
not adequately represent all of the
campus, and did not tend to facilitate
coordination of the various adminis—
trative bodies on the campus. It is
probable that part of the senate will
be made no of delegates from both
men's senate and league board, and,
that these members will serve as rep-
resentatives both of their college class
and of the bodies which they repre—
sent.

The committee form of operation
will probably be chosen, it was,
thought today. Under this plan, com»
mittees of the council will, deal with
the various matters brought up. such
as men’s affairs, women’s affairs, and
campus conduct in various sections,
and that the council as a whole would
scive as a general advisory body to
discuss policies directly affecting all
students. Under this arrangement the
council may consist of as many as
twenty five or thirty members.

Changes in Senate

in line with the student council
reorganization, it is planned to call
a meeting of the “191115 senate to bear
the committee on constitution report
its findings. When the senate was
first organized last fall for the years
work a committee was appointed to
draw up rt constitution providing for
the rearrangement of representation,
and outlining the powers and duties
o fthe senate. This committee- has
never reported, and Fred Winter, '21,
has announced his intention of calling
a meeting of the senate as soon as the
plans for the student council are
heard. Winter is secretary of the
senate.

some change may be made in the
organization of the senate in case the
elective house scheme is‘given a trial
at the dormitories next year. There
is some agitation in favor of trying
out the elective system, with certain
regulations to see that every man is
included in the dormitories so for as
therc are vacant rooms. The outcome
of tbis'will influence the reorganiza—
tion of the senate, according to opin-
{ion erprcsscd on the campus. , '
The whole matter of reorganization
,of student government will be dis-
‘cusscd in the council, and when a plan
is formed, acceptable to the present
,Cmmcil, it will lie placed before the
student body for referendum. It is
also understood that the rcergunia—
;tioii automatically disbaiids the pres-
out council, and elections to make up
the new council will follow, according
to members of the reorganization
committee.
