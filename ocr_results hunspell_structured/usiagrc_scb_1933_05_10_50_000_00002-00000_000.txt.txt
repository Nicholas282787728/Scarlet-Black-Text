A PROBLEM

By a slight majority, Iowa State college stu-
dents votcd last week that compulsory military
training should be abolished in colleges. More
than 900 students registered opinions in the poll.

In View of the fact that military training at
Iowa State college is developed to a high degree,
the results of the poll taken there are even more
interesting than a similar poll taken in a college
which does not have military training. A large
proportion of the ballots favored continuance of
the Citizens Military Training comps. As to tile
League of Nations, 381 voted ill favor of entering
the league with reservations. while 278 opposed
any entrance, and 228 thought that the United
States should join the organization without any
reservations at all.

The largest number of students voting solidly
for any one statement was 549. This number be»
lievcd that wtlr debt ould he reduced if Europe
should disarm and give trude considerations. Only
117 favored complete cancellation of debts, and
206 others voted for full payment of the debts.

After all, this compulsory military training ill
colleges constitutes more of ti problem than eve
tremists on either side of the question l'eall' .
.Witllout dollbt, military training insofar as it dis
ciplinc and development of physique and carriage
are concerned. is it splendid thing. Training- on
the range steadies the eye and nerve . Group loc-
tics encourage cooperation and coordination.

Yet, it is the ultimate purpose for which this
Jraining is intended that has turned many students
and citizens against it, ‘iftcr all, \VlU' should we
spend one-fourth of our 1 es in getting an educa—
tion if war shall smash ,oc ty and make a mock-
ery of our struggles? “It is for this reason that
we must train our youth to he prepared," says one
side. “Preparation will prevent war.”

”It ' for this i asoli that we must disarm and
forget mi tary training,” say others. “if we do
so, others will follow suit "

SEX IN EDUCATION

has ever been a bugfthoo to collcgc illstructo
Naturalism in literature, ill which sex is mentioned
in its normal sphere. is a thing to he read hllt not

enough to start a d lssion on the subject, the
reddening faces, tittellng, and significant side-

is a task to present such snbjcct—lllotter to a mixed

Other Opinions

MEN ARE STILL SUPERIOR
(Daily Kullsan)

Men have always been superior to women and nat-
urauy they always will be. Woman was made from
man's spare rib, and if she is intelligent it is due entirely
to evolution, The trouble is that she is too emotional,
Men aren'tiexcept when it comes to reading.

That is what we had always thought, but to our ut-
ter surprise we learn that men are lowbrows. Of course
we’ve always had a Sneaking notion, but when a psy-
chology professor says soiwell, that proves it.

College men, we discover, are reveltng in “Snappy
Stories,” and “Deadwood Dick," while the fair coeds are
going intellectual with lhsen, Voltaire and H. L. Mon-
oken.

Professor Carroll of the University of Minnesota,
who is the author of the Carroll literary appreciation
tests, says. that a comparison of the scores made by the
two sexes shows clearly that women are superior in
their ability to appreciate pure literature.

Perhaps that is why so many men in public life give
speeches prepared by their wives.

\VARTIME INITIATION FEES
(nrdinna Daily student)

At. least so of the as Skull and Crescent pledges
showed some gumption Thursday night in refusing to
pay wartime initiation fees. Although the organiza-
tion condescended to lower the Cost from 315 to $12.50,
the pledges held out: for $10, which is still about $2.50
more than it should eost.

The present eluh argues that it must stick to the
exorbitant fee to pay up some $400 of accrued debts,
which is like asking a man to pay one dollar for a
hamburger because you ate nine yesterday. Had it
not been for questionable financial praetioes and too
many unnecessary lavish moments, there Wouldn't be
a miniature war debt staring the club in the face.

Only at a few unexpected moments in the last few
years has the Skull and Crescent ever resembled any
thing other than a “mutual admiration" society. The
so bolters are to be commended for refusing to be
browbeaten, beseeehed or threatened into paying for
this year’s club’s sins.

If any of the active members have the interest of
the organization at heart or have any hope for its fu-
ture, they should accept the pledges‘ terms with no
more quibbling. By refusing to do so, their subsequent
raving and half-cooked actions will be the quickest
method of dealing a death blow to Skull and Crescent.

To ignore these so pledges and try to inveigle so
others would be foolhardy. In the first place, it gen-
erally would be understood that the society had to
abandon the cream of the freshman crop for the so
called blue john, Furthermore, no self-respecting
freshman would accept the invitation to membership,
knowing that he was but victimized in the society’s
frantie efforts to pay its debts and save its face.

Regardless of the outcome of the present fracas,
the new members, if there should be any, should see
to it that hereafter all finances are handled through
the bursar's office, and that the club provide itself at
onoe with a faculty adviser. This should eliminate
haphazard handling of finances, which has undermined
the organization.
