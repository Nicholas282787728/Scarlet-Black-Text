Re ra o Boswell discusses the war, intelligence
p p. and student political involvement

3v Eu ZIGAS

Congressman Leonard Boswell faces one of the
tightest election races in the country as Representa-
tive from the Third District of Iowa, which encom-
passes Grinnell as well as Des Moincs.

The Center for voting and Democracy has pro-
jected Boswell’s race to be as close as it was in 2002.
That year, Boswell was reelected with only 53 perr
cent of rhe vote. His challenger in 2002 and again
in this year, Republican Stan Thompson, garnered 45
percent ofthe vore, a difference of 18,082 vores.

772: 5813 caught up with Boswell at the Demo—
cratic National Convention in Boston on July 29.

The War in Iraq

Boswell has serious concerns about President
Bush’s invasion of Iraq. In October 2002, Boswell
voted ro authorize the use offorce in Iraq. “I thought
of'it as authority ifrhe President had facts . . . that said
Americans were in grave danger," he noted, nearly
two years after the vote. He has since reconsidered.

Boswell is especially disturbed by the difference
between President Bush‘s apparent goals in 2002 and
his later actions in Iraq. In describing a meeting he
and other members of Congress had with the presi-
dent before the vote, Boswell recalledisaying, “Mr.
President, do you remember how we left Vietnam?
Don’t let that ever happen to us again." According to
Boswell, President Bush then “said he wouldn't."

Boswell paused. “Draw your own conclusion on
how rhar’s happened,”he said.

Boswell emphasized being misled more than
once. “I feel like [the president] was not forthright. If
he meant it when he said it, he forgot. Or otherwise
he didn’t mean it."

mittce on Intelligence, putting the 9/11 Comlniy
sion Report at the forefront ofhis mind. At the time
ofthe interview, somc House Republicans were com
mcnting rhar the suggestions orihe 9/11 Commission
deserved ample time for studied consideration,
Boswell expressed his concern that it was “not
right" for Congress to recess so soon after the report
was released and that it didn‘t always make sense to
“take your time when you're at war." He tapped the
table With his ﬁnger for emphasis, distinguishing his
concern for the commission’s repoit and its impact on
national intclligcncc,“This is important,"hc said.
After riie report was released, Boswell signed a
letter to the Speaker of the House, requesting it) he
called back to session, on rhe morning otriiis intern
view, he received word that he had to do just that.

Students and Boswell‘s Campaign

When asked why students should be interested in
his campaign. Boswell was quick to cite his emphasis
on education and experience.

“First off,” he said, “they ought to be interested in
my campaign because I support education and I have
a history of supporting it." Having spoken with John
Kerry and John Edwards earlier in the week, Boswell
said that they “felt the same on education . . . it's an
investment."

In addition, Boswell thinks voters “should choose
someone [who] has experience." For Boswell, this ex~
perience includes Vietnam military service and eight
years in Congress. Boswell refered to his policy oftry-
ing to have someone from his office on the Grinneii
College campus at least once a month as eVidcnce of
his interest in student votes.

Grinnellians at the DNC

Student faces and voices join the crowd at the Democratic National Convention in late July

EV ELi ZIGAS

“It’s what I love about Grinnell...
people don't give a shit — it doesn't
impress people." said Grant Woodard
'06 of his new position as president
of the College Democrats of America
(CDA).

Woodard’s uncontested election was
just one event in the week-long politi-
cal extravaganza in Boston surrounding
the Democratic National Convention
(DNC). Between July 25 and 29, nearly
5,000 delegates, 15,000 members of
the media, and thousands of other po-
litically-inclined people came to call
Bosron home. Woodard was only one
ofa handful Grinnellians in Beantown
figuring out how they would take part
in the 2004 presidential campaign.

College Democrats
National Convention

Woodard might believe that Grin-
nellians don't think a lot about College
Democrats ofAmerica, but he has been
thinking about the organization for a
long time. After sewing as President
of the Iowa College Democrats, he
was nominated for the position by the
last CDA President, Ashley Bell, who
called him a “young man who knows
the challenges orour generation."

Woodard expressed his agenda to
CDA campus organizers from around
the country, announcing. “I’m trying
to make the CDA the AARP for stun
dcnts."Hcscesthcstudcntorganization,
which is supported by the Democratic
party, as being “on the cusp" of doing
great things. And, he told the half-full
auditorium, “I’m going to work my ass
offforyoii."

Listening in the audience was Ben

dition, Jacobs was a key organizer for
presidential candidate John Kerry last
year and is currently president of the
Grinnell College

Demociats.

Jacobs tiaveled
to Boston because
he wanted to be
more active in the
political process,
Having spent time
at the CDA convcn—
tion“connectingand

neil focused on supporting Democrats
in stateeievei rates in loiva, On August
9,}acobs sent an email to the Grinnell
Democrats stating a goal of having “at
least 900 Grinncll students come out
and vote"in Novembei for nor only the
national ticket, but also the state ticket.

A couple of days before the main
event in Bosroii, the College Demo-
crats' National Convention kicked off
with rraining sessions sponsored by
the Democratic Grassroots Action In,
suture and Network (GAIN). Works
shop session ropics included campaign
fundraising diibbcd “New Bling" and
“All About the Benjamins."l\ training
for internct communication wa, allcd
“Rcality BytcsiAltcrnative Aer "

Despite the creative titles, rhe
trainings didn't appeal to some of the
Grinnellians in attendance. (\ndrcw
Behrendt ’06, who admits to being a
“little cynical and jaded," found that
the triunings’ focus on large campaigns
didn't tiriiisfci well to Grinnell's small
campus.

The Main Stage

Dan Grossbclg 05.5 didn't come

College Democrats, He was in oil

ficlol delegate. “I think it’s abhorrent
that you can get your college paid for
by paying people to take up arms and
shoot someone you've never met. but
not if you want to dedicate your life
to teaching oi social work,” Grossbetg
explained as one reason for becoming
active in politics.

Impresscd with presidential can-
didate Dick Gephardt's commitment
to rewarding young Americans for
nonrmilitnry service, Grossberg origin
nally threw his weight behind the Miss
souri congressman. Aftei the caucuses
however, Grossberg backed Edwards
and occasionally Kerry, while working
through county and district gatherings.

Politicking through the state po-
litical landscape, he chntually beat six
other candidates to become a delegate
from the Third Congressional District
oflown. It cost him over 81500 to come
as a delegate. concerned with a feeling
that “more and more young people are
turning out to be conservative,” Grossc
berg hopes ro rctum to Griiincll, share
his convention experience and help
elect Presidential hopeful John Kerry.

The election is nvo months away.
Iowa is a swing state with seven cov»
etcd electoral college Votes And, if the
caucuses are any inditarion, Iowa sriie
dents arc tuining out in larger numbers
than in recent history. The polls and
forecasts suggest that the 2004 election
may he as close as 2000, an idea that
has campaigners hitting Griiincil hard
in the form of rundraising, canvassing,
advertising and political ﬁreworks lead-
ing up to November 2. ‘

Most Grinnciiians are only now be-
ginning to get a taste ofthc iirial sprint
to Election Day, But, a few were iii
Bosroii when that sprint began for the
