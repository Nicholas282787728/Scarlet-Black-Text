G. Lester Duke announced last
night that he will assume coach—
ing duties of the varsity basket
gall squad, filling the vacancy
lett in the staff by the departure
of Benny Doulas, head coach. for
navy training.

No announcement was made
concerning coaching of the swim—
ming team, however. Alfred Fri
bie, town senior and captain of
the natators, said the squad would
continue regular practices until
an official announcement was
made.

Duke, who played basketball for
Grinneu in the 1922 23 and 1923-
24 seaso‘ns, has had little coaching
experience in that sport, but has
been guiding the freshman squad
this year, using the same type
of instruction.

Last night Duke said that Dona
glas' departure was not totally
unexpected and that they had
talked over some plans for the
future of Grinnell athletics be-
fore the head coach left.

Taking over Duke’s duties with
the freshman squad will be Gene
Peisl-ler, '41, who has been em—
ployed in the personnel office
this year. He will continue in
that capacity as well.

Just how long the former Gii
nell star will be able to remain
here is up to the demon dragon
draft. Peisner said last night that
he is awaiting call into the army
and does not believe he will be
able to remain here a full year.

Peisner played for Grinnell dur-
ing the 194041 season when the
Pioneers won the co-championship
of the Midwest conference. He
was co»captain of the squad and
was forward on the all-conference
team.

Beloit college announced its with—
drawal from intercollegiate lithe
letics for the duration of the War
and proposed this step for all
members of the mid-west confer-
ence at the sonrannual confer—
ence meeting two weeks ago, but
none of the other schools, includ»
ing Griniiell, were in favor or the
action.

Interference of varsity aﬂlleta
ics,- especially basketball, with the
government conditioning program
of all the students was given as
the chief reason for the measure.
Beioit has only one gym and
their classes are arranged in such
a way that the conditioning per-
iods for both men and women
must come after 3:00 p, in,

Lieutenant Robert Whan, officer
in charge of athletics {or the
Candidates’ school, said yester-
day. The men had already prac—
ticed three nighm when the de-
cision was made. It was thought
that the candidates would have
too little time to do a good job
and that the graduation of com»
