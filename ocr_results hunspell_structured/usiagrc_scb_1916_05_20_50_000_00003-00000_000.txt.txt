lion of Other Buildings
Also in Sight .

Work on the new .ilumni llztll,
which has been somewhat delayed
during the past week owing to ditir
cultics in securing materials, will bc
rccommenccd as soon as the materials
which are causing the delay a e,
herore the iii-st or June at the latest,
according to a statement made 31357
terday by iir. L. v. plielps, who has
charge oi construction im- the college,
Mr. Phelps expressed some doubt that
the new building would be ready for
immediate occripation at the opening
oi the school year next tall. but said
that all ettorts will he made to rush
ﬁne work so that it may be ready loi-
use as soon as passible.

Mr. Phelps explained the delay as
bei g due to peculiar conditions ore—l
vailing this spring which make it ime
possible to secure materials on time.
He mentioned in illiis connection the
uncertainty ol prices and the fact
that they are going up all the time.
‘Cspecially in steel and stone construc-
tion materials, These conditions are
causing extra work tor the architects,‘
necessitating the expenditure of
great amount oi time. The present
delay is as much due to this iact as
to the shortage oi materials on hand,‘
Meanwhile, various odds and ends oi
the work on the building are being
completed so that there will be no‘»
t'urtner waste oi time alter the inste-
rials arrive,

The construction oi this new recites
tion building, on which work was heel

MALTESE DNDSS HAS
WDN B DRAKE DUALS

'Grinnell Has Margin of One Vic-

tory Over Bulldog Track Team
in Eleven Years of Dual
Relations—Strong in
All the Races.

Despite the publicity given to
Drake's Victories in the annual dual
with Grinnell in recent years, a. short
study of the records of this event from
its beginning gives the Maltese Cross
s' . victories to live ior the Univer'srly.
Owing to the result Df last year's con-
test, a majority of 57 a points fur the

a eleven years is in [ever of the Bulldog

aggregation. The meet was eslablishr
ed in 1003 and continued to he an ans
nual event until 1909. when a triangu-
lai- meet was arranged with Drake and
spies. The trian ular was dropped in
er Drake dual re-
established. .

Crinnell has been continually weak
in iield events. Ziegler, lcatui-ing in
the weight events oi 1000, and hair,
0[ earlier lame. who held a broad
jump rccoi-d oi nearly 22 ieet, are the
only notable exceptions to this rule.
Hurdles and dashes have almost in-
rariably been our strongest events.
in the days under Jack Watson, Hey-
l'lnn. hair, and Clow were the stellar
periorniei-s, with Huff, Turner, and
Flannigan carrying away the honors

in the later seasons of ‘06, 'OT, and:

'08.
For a dual niect llle records have
been exceptionally good. As ea: '
1903, the two niile i iit in 10 2 “.
the mile in 4:35 and the broad
jump in 21 feet and 10 inches. In
1003, Conaway oi Drake. who still
holds the state title in this er-cnt, uas
pushed to 40 leet and 3 inches ioi-

Grinnell Rainks Above Anything

ment, Resources, Library
Largest in Iowa.

That Crinnell is the largest ﬁnder
pendent Liberal Arts college in the
country is shown by comparison or
the number or Liberal Arts students
at Crinnell ith the liberal art en-
rollment at nine others or the largest
independent institutions, The nine
colleges listed highest are Dartmouth,
Oberlin, Grinnell, Colorado, Williams,
Pomona, Cornell, Carleton, and Coc.
Counting the total enrollment at these
colleges, Grinnell ranks third, aiter
Dartmouth and Obcrlin. though these
iirst two are not strictly Liberal Arts
schools.

In comparison with low colleges,
Crinnell easily ranks ﬁrst in Liberal
Arts enrollment, Cornell, Coe, and
Simpson iollowing in the order named.
in endowment and library Grinnell
also excells. There are 52,722 vol-
umes in the Carnegie Library at Cri e
nell, while Cornell has 40,000, and Coo
something over 12,000. Grrnnell
also the richest school in the state in
the matter or endowment, having a
productive innd oi $1,325,013, Cornell
is second with $1,000,000, and Coo
third with $500,000

Ranking Grinneil with independent
colleges in the west outside oi Iowa
