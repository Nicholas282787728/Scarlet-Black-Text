Oratorical Contest.

Now that the football season is
drawing to aclose thereis another
matter of large importance which
should demand the attention and
hearty coropei ation of every menir
ber of the student body Tlle
Annual Home Oratorical Contest
is not far offiwe might almost
say that it is already upon us and
there is still a vast amount of
work to be done by the men and
women of the institution ifwe are
to have a contest worthy of the
name and one which be a
credit to the ins‘itulioni

The Oratorical Association
not dead. The interest niailiiest-
ed last year in the work otthe Ass
sociation has caused it to take on
a new lease of life. and if the shy
dent body will only do its part
there is no reason ill the world
why Grinnell should not only be
represented but ably rrplesellted
at‘the state contest at Indiaaola
next February. Most of us well
remember the feeling of satlslac-
tion witll which we sent otll' dele-
gation to Osltaloosa last year and
the hope was generally expressed
that we might from that time on
have a levival of tlle old time ill-
tercst in college oratory. It tllis
is still our desne now is oui op
portunity. Shall we improve it
or not? That question must be
settled by eacll and every student
of Iowa College.

We need not excuse outselves
by saying that Grinnell cannot

compete on the plalfol'm with our
sister colleges because ot lacl: oi
ability. No loyal son of Grimlell
would admit that. We have the
ability. It may lie dormant but
it is here. All that is needed is
that a ﬁtting share ofour magniﬁe
cent college spirit shall be intnscd
into this legitimate and Vital part
of our college life and we need
not worry about results,

There are still ﬁve or six weeks
before the date of the home con-
test. several have already sinili-
ﬂed their intention of enteli
but the ofﬁcers ot the assoc
would like to see a still gitater
interest. It is of the utmost im-
portance that we have a strong
delegation at Illdiallola for they
will carry with them the pledges
of a majority ofthe last statc Corr
vention to make Grinncll the lo-
cation ot the state contest in 'go.
Let us all do our part and work
toward that end.

and prove to the mutual beneﬁt of both
schools.

The above action is the result
of a most carcftll canvass of tile
present situation and was Ialtcrl
with the ﬁrtn conviction that it
will be productive of a better unr
derstanding between the football
managements of Iowa State Col-
lege and Council,
games alter 1898.

In the discussion of the resollls
tion the point was distinctly ems
plia ed and reiterated that no
unirrendly teehng has existed or
does now exist between the sttlr
dent body at Amos and the stus
dent body at Grinnell.

The game last Saturday was a
m glliﬁcent exhibition and
ably free from those ohjeo

characterize a football game when
there is a keen rivalry eXisting,
