FRIDAY'S CHAPEL TALK.

’96. Many present

Yesterday morning in chapel Pros
fessol'Nol‘i gave a very interesting
tall: on the art or daydreaming. The
subiect Nimactimpdritively new one
and very timely and interesting. Ii is
talk in substance was as folloi , : Those
who have talked to us on the advan-
tage of building castles iu the air have
usually been thought of as idealists,
dreamerormyst“ s and most of iishave
a feeling that d tuning is reprelicusi
bleand that. we are wasting time when
we indulge our imaginations. The
fact oi the matter is,howe .r, that
only those who dream ever do any-
thing of note in this world Great
mindsalwaysliavegi-eat ons. Our
master artists, our prophets, ourstates-
men, our warriors have all been dream-
em but the record oi their lives and
the product of their labor is an inspir-
ation to us, It is the right ol youth to
dream in a way that stus its imagin-
ation tosee an honorable and a service-
ablelife ahead. In fact college isoi-
should be a systematic course in
dreaming where by the proper play of
the imagination broad vistas ofliie
and new spheres of living are disclosed
which otherwise we might Ileverex~
perience. Character is made by dream—
ing and the one hope oi the next gen-
eration is that it shall producc a
dreaming youth which shall not be
content until visions are deeds and

ideals realities,

The members of the Modern Lan—
guage Conference will get the pro
gramme for the next meeting from

DR. CADY’S LECTURE

Splendid Discourse on Tennysonionly

its there is more than one way to re-
move the pelt from acat, so there is
more than one way oi showing loyalty
to acollege. Whether it was the cit»
izens of Grinncll or the students of
Iowa College who were to blame is ims
material, but certain it is that only a
iair sized audience greeted Dr. George
Luther Cody last evening and listened
to a lecture that should have paclred
the chapel to the doors. On account
of the excellence of the lecture and
the generous motives which prompted
the lecturer, and for the sake of the
new chapel, the old chapel should
have been better ﬁlled. Opportun-
ities to hear such lectures are not
often forthcoming.

As the title indicates the lecture
was in the form ota biography inter-
spersed with quotations from and apt
pr-eciations of Tennyson’s works. The
lantern slides with which the lecture
was illustrated were made irom Dr.
Cad)"; ile lure. edition or the poet and,
are absolutely unique to say nothing
of the artistic quality which they lend
to the lecture.

The year 1309, Dr, Cady said. might
be calledrhe ”year wonderful“ as it
brought into the world Gladstone,
Lincoln, Ilnrwiu and Tennyson. Ten-
nyson, he cliaracteiizcd. as the great
cstpoct of the common people. He
inherited royal blood on his father's
side and intellectual and spiritual
qualities from his mother. Lllie most
greztl, men Oicitliel' literature or pol-
-, he was ivell versed in the class

lie was a great lover‘oi flutiiie.
Tile essence of poetry is to be in tune
with the iniiuite. ln is23he went to
Oxford where he came in contact with
a remarlrahle number of great men,
notable among whom was Arthur
riallnm whose friendship was to have
a lasting adect on Tennysou’s his and
poetry and whose death called forth
“In Memoriam,” considered by mitny
the greatest poem since those days of
Milton and Dante. ”The Princess”
the most delightfulofbis poems, his
childrens’poems,“Maud,""Ode to Wei»
liugtou,"his best short poem,“1dyls of
the King," of matchlcss purity and
moral insight, and his other poems
and dramas were touched upon and
reviewed.

Beautiiul pictures showing the
poet’s face and his favorite haunts
and homes iollowed the text through-
out. Old age did not bring Tennyson
senility. On the contrary it wasin
old age that he produced some of his
greatest works. He had the essential
qualities of asaint, respect forsanctity
of marriage, love or humanity, and
faith in immortality. Tlle lecture
was iittiugly closed by‘ the recital

of“Crossing the Bar" and the audi-
ence then ioined in singing “Jesus
Saviour, Pilot Me.”
