-LURIE: 0n the grounds of con-
stitutionality, then, I ask you, as
author of the Duration student
government plan, to explain how,
in accordance with point E in that
plan, I could remain on the dul‘ar

was elected president of the c.

of that body. A new (i. of H. P.

Speaking constitutionally, 1 could
not remain on the duration coun-

had not elected me.

false, due to a inisinterprctntitni

of the year,

This did not mean. McKcoii
maintained, that he would remain
as the, president of c. of H. In,
but iiieiely that that individual
would be a member of the council

liUnlE: The consensus at the
time of ratification was certainly
that there would be no house
elections this spring. On that
understanding, the duration plan,
allowing for the continuation of
myself in office, was ratified on
Feb. 22 by the entire student
body, with but one dissenting vote.

MCKEO, That‘s just too bad.

Miss Mccool here opened the
discussion to the students, attends
ing the meeting for their ques
tions or opinions. Catherine Funlo
Cleveland junior, then posed two
questions She quoted hir, Mm
Kcoll as replying to a question
from her regarding the status of
hall elections, at the time of the
ratification of Feb. 22, that hall
elections would not in his opinion
he held this spring. This answer
was also given in conversation
following the meeting, at which
time he more stiongly emphasized
the iinpracticality of elections at
this time

Secondly, she asked the status
of Ed Kraiise in this meeting,
since all other men called to the
stage in that group were signers
of the open forum letter, exccpt
Ki-aiise

)Ir. Krzlusc replied that he was
sitting- on the platform because
he had tiecn requested to do so liy
Mi - alcontil. alisa .llcCool said
sh had so aslted him because
“many people think he has on im-
portant t'olllleclion with the i
sue." Miss Funk asked it ltrmisc
had seen the letter before it w. -
published. ltrouse replied he id
brought the letter to the Scarlet
and lilac-k office in “the hope
that it unuld he published the
t'otlouing- day."

Jack Crandall, signer and Read
sophomore, asked what difference
who signed the. letter, or who sat
on the platform mode.

Stouart )lttElrnvy, council
member, pointed out that “in nus
promo court tlcoi."nlls. all poets
of it tillesliall are considered."

James Gardner, Dibble junior,
stated that College men did not
realize the importance of the Feb.
22 vote. John Miller, Dibble sell-
ior, asked \\hy special mention of
the proposed c. of H P. action
had not been made in housemcet-
ing hetero the action was taken.

A polling of c. of ll. 1). IIICIII~
hers roit led ninst houses had
let the discussion pass with only
slight discussion at best.

Discussion then swerved to this
question: iiliy was nut the chal—
lenge of the legality of the c. of
ll. P. action in postponing clear
tions not brought directly to c.
of H. P. members, why was it
thrown to the public through the
newspaper, without any prellmll‘r
ary questioning of the men iii-
volved?

Miss Funk then explained her
possession of a letter addressed to
Miss McCool, saying it had been
submitted to her by a represents
tive of the signers. To the query
\\’llcll|Bl‘ she-had ever revoked
private copy of the letter, ill
hirCool stated no, emphatically.

A return to the primary ques
tion of constitutionality was then
urged by Gene Meciirdy, Rawson
sophomore. AL the suggestion of
John Consort. Rawson senior, a
ten-minute rcccss was granted,
during which representatives of
the council called faculty meme
hers for legal advice.

Upon the establishment of the
principal that the by-law was an
integral part of the constitution
of any body, following the inter»

ments of the evelllllg, The coun-
cil then retired to vote, returning
a {40—1 derision in fewer of the
c. of ll. in. but recommending
that if sufficient student interest
has been amused by the question,
a petition containing- the names of
10 per cent or the male student
body he presented to the council.
requesting regular hall elections.
Such a petition would be obligate
tory upon the c. of H. P.

Upon question from Harry Wa-

such a petition would require in~
dividual, personal signatures of all
signers.
