A BELATED WARNING

A report made public. recently by the Eco-
nomics Commission of the National Council of
Uhristian Associations, ill which both leading polit»
lcal parties are denounced, should prove of interest
on the Grillllell college campus. According to tllc
report. the parties oppose the best interests of the
“n‘orkra-day consumers.” and the council urges its
followers to support a socialistic gram. of action.
The League for Independent Pol ical Action, such
as the socialist party advocates, is favored.

All of this sounds like so much poppycock nur
til one realizes that the council is the joint body
through which the. college Young Women’s and
Young Men’s Christian associations work nation-
ally. Perhaps therein lies the solution to the coup
plaillts of so many students regarding the destruc-
tive speeches given ill Grillnell this year. The one
pearanccs of Paul Blanshard and Kilby Page were
sponsored, it will be remembered, by the Y.)I.C.A.

Christianity and the economic policies no“ ill
use are in direct conflict, the report of the council
says. The statement strikes the Grimlcll campus
with a familiar ring. The commission issues slate-
nlcnt after statement of smoothly phrased recom-
mendations including the providing for unemploy-
ment insurance, oldage pensions. eventual abolir
tion of tariff parties, armament reductions, “equal-
ization of opportunity,” and other Utopian theor-
125.

Many of the ideas favored are distinctly radi.
cal when considered from a typically American
viewpoint. Docs that mean that the Y.M.C.A. and
Y.W.C,A., supported by so many thousands of peo-
ple, are actually entering politics With the coun-
cil distinctly throwing itself into tllc political luacl-
strom and the Christian associations working
through that council, such appears to be the case.

The report brings out the dangers of a relig-
us group entering the political ﬁeld. however. It

io
is hardly likely that the associations themselves

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

arc to be involved in world politics. Their field
extends to a duty of greater importance. Many stur
dents will reach that conclusion after pondering on
the report. but the difficulty lies in tho lllany who
will hazard an opinion on ﬁrst thought and brand
the associations at once as fanatical zealots.

A reverse move would ho wise for the Christ-
ian groups now. A lll step has been made ill allmw
ing the names of the olgallizations to be drawn into
such a controversy, and that report alone may
mean the loss of the support of thousands of con»
servative Americans

It may warn Grillllell Y.l\I.C.A. ofﬁcials that
radicalism is a wonderful stimulant to thought, but
palls if continued steadily.

__Gi
FROM OPPOSITE ENDS
”A rose byally other name i , lst as sweet.”
So are student gradcs even though they are

placed on ﬁle at the ofﬁce of the registrar rathcr‘

than doled out to thc stndcnt on slips of colored
paper. Students are still judged by grades ill all
departments of college and by academic institu-
tions everywhere, regardless of what grading sysr
telu may be in use.

The Grillllell college faculty, in seeking to
lessen grade consciousness at Grimlcll has changed
the grading system from A, :13, C, D, and E, to Satis~
factory. Poor. and Failure, The move resulted, pre-
sumably, from sentiment expressed by the stucdllts
who thought the old system unfair and likely to
give the collcgiall a grade complex.

The move has its good points, of course. It may
bring closer contact between tllc student and pro-
fessor and it may lessen the friction which natur-
ally arises at the borderline of A,B and C grades.
The thing the students want, howcvcr, is a change
ill the way they are judged by the instructors, Ill
that respect this new move is a complete failure,

It is scarcely possible that the students and in-
structors could get together on the matter. The
students want to reform the. administrative side
of the situation while the faculty wants to change
the grades which the student 5ch without ally
actual ﬂdllli‘nisil‘ﬂiIVC change. This it will continue
as before, with one professor giving B and another
D for the same amount of work and knowledge.

After all the old system has managed to func-
tion pretty well for several ycnrs without ally vcry
disastrous consequences. Even though the altera-
tion in grading proves to show little improvement.
it certainly isn’t going to cause a complete break»
down. Why should the student complain?

G
LITTLE RADICALS
(From the Beloit Round-Table)

Many oi the thinking college men and women create
for themselves ideals which they hope to live up to in
their lives after graduation. seeing a quiet perspective
of life which precludes entrance into the rush of com-
petitive business or ﬁnding their happiness in a peaceful.
restful detachment from most of the world, they may
learn to detest the great American campaign of dollar
grabbing and glory seeking. They prefer to retain their
individuality in a humble position rather than discard
it altogether in a. machinerlike job, They prefer not to
be standardized.

Occasionally one has enough money to live as he
wishes. The overwhelming desire to live up to the indi-
vidualistic ideal may cause some to neglect the worldly
life and endure privatioh. May these few be praised, for
they art the preservation of idealism, hope, independ-
ence, and individualism.

Of course, these young people will face the necessity
of earning a living for themselves and their loved ones.
The simple need of food will shatter this ideal for many
people. Gradually, as the ideals they had hoped to live
up to grow dimmer in the past, their dreams become
merely ycuthtul ideas that they tossed aside to travel
down a narrow rut the remainder of their lives.

(Continued from page 1)
The villagers are pleased by the mus-
ic with the exception of one Child,
who thrusts the elfin child aside.
This same boy who could not ap-
prcciate beauty becomes a wealthy
prince, and returns to his village
home years later. He finds the vil—I
lagers, not recognizmg beauty, erect-
ing a grotesque image in honor of the
prince. A dance “Vanity and Flat-
tery,” shows the atmosphere of the
occasion While the “Child who loves
Beauty" is pushed aside lamenting
that he must leave the village and
his beloved spring.

Bow to status
With the appearance of the artist,
he is assured that his Image will
stay In the village forever In the form
of a statue. The villagers eagerly
watch the artist and ﬁnally bow down
to the enchantment of the statue
while the prince leaves in scorn.
Among the women taking leading
parts in the tantasy were Barbara
Neubec‘ker as the “Child who loves
Beauty," Helen Talbott as the prince;
Faith Mason as the artist and Esther
Gehr as the statue.

Planar Good

Cecil Panor, in a gypsy hegger
dance before the villagers, created
one of the most Vivid impressions of
interpretation of the entire program.
The class in pageantl'y was respon-

' sible for costumes. Mrs. 0. E. Nif-

fenegger was chief accompanist and
Miss Muriel Ratcllffe was in charge
of make-up. Richard Gelston super-
vised the lighting.
