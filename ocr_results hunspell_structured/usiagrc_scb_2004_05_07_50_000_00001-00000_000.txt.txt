bined with more Dining Dollars, a Forum Grille rhar is open longer wlrh
more food oprions and more “display cooking," where rhe meal is made to
order.

According to Dick Williams, dirccror orDining Services, rhe changes
will eike place because “srudenrs wanred more ﬂexibility and more op.
tions.”

The decisions were made after the administration hired a consultant
to look at dining oprions for die planned campus Center, Williams said.

that Southern Express virus “not considered a value." \Vllliams said.

According ro Williams, “Southern Express has always been a problem
as a meal equivalency. " He said many srudenrs did not feel it woo fair that
they replaced a meal wirli rhe $3.50 ar Southern Express. “We have been
thinking ofclosing Southern Espress tor the ho two years," he said. “h

However, Lhe Dining Services Conimirree, which is supposed to foster
discussion between students and
dining staff members, did nor

committee member Steve Fold
‘05.

Ford ﬁrst heard about the
possible closing orSourhern Ex-
press from a hall senator who had
been called by a constituent who had heard a rumor. According to Ford,
when he asked Williams if it was true, Williams said, “No comment.”
When Ford asked Williarns' boss, John Kaikbmnncr, vice president for
Coiiege Services, Ford was told, “We‘re looking at the issue." According to
Ford, that was the same response that all students on the committee re
ceived or every poinr ofthe process when rhey qiiesrioned whar was being
done.

The consultant never came and talked to the students on the commit»
lee, Ford said, and rhe mass email intormlng all students orrhc changes
was also the ﬁrst time the students on the committee ofﬁcially heardoFthe

think rhar iryou asked in a poll who wanred to gcr all A's, you would be

He thinks that studenn want to see changes in the Southern Express

The students on rhc Dining Services Coiiirnirrec as well as Eh Zigns
‘06, a member orrhe Campus Center Cninniirrse, describe in lerrers to
the sic/HS this week theil frustration at what they consider to be the incor-
rect actions ofthe adlninistlation.

Williams thinks that students hungry for the snacks oFSotlthern EXe
press will ﬁnd solace in rhe expanded orreiings nr rhe Grille. “As much no
we can, we will provide those snacks," he said. “it will be the best of both
worlds,” He noted that there will have to be some creative thinking in
order ro expand rhe Grilles oprions while snll remaining in die same sized
building

“I think this will really be a positive,” \Villiams said. The initial reac
tion may be, ‘l'in losing somcrhiiig; but more will be inoie Dining Dole

Yvonne Van Ommen, the attendant at Southern Express is sad to see it
go. “it's a shame,” she said. “lr's a lor ofﬂin and tin going to miss ir."
According to Williams, Van ominen wiii be moved ro nnorlicr posirion
