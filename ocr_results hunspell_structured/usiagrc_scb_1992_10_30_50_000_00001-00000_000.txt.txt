Women's Center. Nyasha Spears.
fearless spokeswoman for gen-
derrbased crime issues. gave the
opening address in which she rer
explained her growing sexism.
Spears also reaffirmed the imr
portance of action. for both per»
sonal and societalchange. stress-
ing that awareness is not enough.

Each speaker ended their pre-
sentation with a line from a song
by Holly Near, “We who believe
in freedom cannot rest.“ Many
statistics were quoted by several
speakers, all of which contribr

uted to the conclusion which pro
fessor Jane Kneller stated, that
the surgeon general has an-
nounced that, "Violence is great,
est risk to women’s health.” Stu-
dents from several organizations
read poems and other personal
statements.

marchers were heckled by sev-
eral car loads of, apparently,high
school boys. These events were
reported to the Grinnell police.

ter. There will be further cover»

New attacks on students, city convenes hearing

by Konstantinus
Kambouroglou
A Special Report

it is common knowledge to our
campus’ community that harassment
of students by young townspeople
takes place on a quite regular basis.
Last week, yet another incident of
harassment occurred: five members
of the college community were chased
by hostile young adults, bearing
knives. Had the movie theatre not
been open, the unfortunate college
people would not have found shelter
andthcremighthavebecnevenworse
news than this. Among the victim
was Nadeem Siddiqui, director of
Quad Dining Hall, who says that he
had never been chased before in his
life. The incident disturbed him so
much that not only did he report it to
the police, but he also spoke to the
mayor, Mr. Robert Anderson. To
Siddiqui’s astonishment, the mayor
admitted itwas the ftrsttime thatsuch
an incident was coming to his attenr
tion. This motivated mayor Ander»
son to bring the issue to the attention
of the city council‘s Safety Commit
tee.

The committee met on Tuesday
and the victims of the assault were
invited to address its members. Rep~
resenting the victimsiand the col-
legecommunityiwereSiddiquistu-
dent Geeta Cowlagi and RA Steve
Schneiter. Mayor Anderson very
kindly introduced the issue to the
members of the committee and the
people present, among whom, the
resigning and succeeding Police
Chiefs and Karen Bode Baxter, ex—
ecutive director of nonprofit, down
town betterment organization Main
Street Grinnell.

The mayor brieﬂy suggested c ity
response through public information
on the issue. Cowlagi got the floor
first, and with a moving speech exV
pmsed herfeelings aboutthcissucof
townspeople’s animosity towards stu-

dents and especially against racial
and ethnic minority members. Tak—
ing the floor, Siddiqui emphasized
the mayor’s prevtous ignorance of
the problem. “There have been nu-
merous incidents of harassment and
the Student Affairs office has reported
all ofthetn to ihcpolice, butthcpolicc
can only do so much," said Siddiqui;
‘This time it was me, maybe tomor-
row it will be you or your children.
Grinnelldoes notneed this. Wecome
here for education and improvement
and we shottld not have to deal with
threats like this; the community of
Grinnell should educate the people
on the problem."

Ms. Baxter spoke then, to note
that the problem is not only with
students, but also with local people:
especially senior citizens. She rev
poatedly said that the hostile youngr
sters are just a handful and that they
should be tackled.

The resigning Chief of the Po-
lice, Dan Boyer. informed that on
Mondaynightthcthrccharassers(two
from Grinnell, the third from Jasper
county) werearrested, “Thoonc from
Jasper,” he said, “was a repeat of-
fender and has been convicted for
some previous assault on campus.
Some otherkidhad been convicted to
10 years in the State Penitentiary, for
attacking a student and asking for
money. I remember him saying in
court that he was just kidding, but
what he had done was robbery.“ The
Chief noted here, that Grinnell has a
much lower number of harassment
incidents than other college towns,
but this should notstop us from wor-
rying,whileitisstillearly;weshould
educate kids at school, when they‘re
young. “I metwith CollegeStaff,”he
added, “and the advice we have for
students is: do whatthe victimsof last
week’s assault did. that is, take their
license number, remember what they
looklikeandhelpyourselvesbyhelpr
ing the police.“

Baxter noted here, that some

measure should definitely be taken
fordowntown, for the cinema and the
various restaurants should not be the
only available protection, The Chief
replied that the foot patrols that have
been intensified lately, are an excel-
lent tool for monitoring the streets at
late hours. In fact, the foot patrollcrs
check if doors are locked and win-
dows shut. in order to protect down-
town residents and store owners; this
happens on aregularbasis, from 9 pm
till 2 in the morning. The main prob
lem is to patrol both the campus and
the downtown areas at the same time.
A bicycle patrol has been decided
upon recently. Although less obvi-
ousthanpolicccars,thismcasurehas
the disadvantage ofiis direct depen-
dence on weather conditions.

Council member at large Jim
Whitemadeastatementforthemedia
(the S & B and the Grinnell Herald,
which was also represented in the
meeting): “We have concern for the
issue, Wehave to organizetheeduca-
tion of the people. We shall empha»
size that we will notgive harassers a
slap the wrist. We should have a
program both in the Middle and High
School. The problem will not go
away on its own.

RA Schneiter suggested the op-
tion of the “panic buttons" that exist
in big cities, Panic buttons can be
especially helpful to victims of as-
sault that are not sufficiently mobile
to runaway (Le. senior citizens and
physically impaired persons).
Schneiter also suggested the installa—
tion of campaign signs that would
warn: We don’t tolerate these things.
White added that kids could make
relevant posters in the relevant edu—
cational programs.

Council metnber 4th ward Carl
Wittrup pointed out that it is home,
where kids learn to hate and their
education has to start at home. “We
should let the parents know we're
serious,” he continued, ”the damage
isalready done forages 5-25; they are

already programed and we must com—
bat them. This has to be done through
the media; we can’t go house to
house. "

White proposed that on Monday
night, the City Council should enr
dorse the college community’s re»
quest for action. ”We should use Lite

media to get the warning through to
the people.”

Karen Baxter informed theccm-
mittee about SGA’s considerable ef-
forts to educate the younger children
and to bring them closer to college

Soviet Minister Visits

by Riva Sharples

“All of us in the world are going
in the same prcvailing direction, to
wards democracy," said former Soviet
Foreign Minister Aleksandr
Bessmcnnykh October 27 to a large
group of college students, faculty. and
Grinnell community members.
Bcssmennykh's lecture, “New, Old
Russia: The Country of Crisis and
Hopes,“ dealt with recent events in the
former SovietUnion and with the fu-
tureof theRussian-Amcrican relation-
ship.

“Under our very eyes, the picture of
Russia has changed," he said. ”The
Soviet Union has deteriorated. The
Cold War is over 7 the world will
nevcrbethcsamc again. And now,the
former Soviet Union is in a time of
crisis.”

One of the major problems for So
vieLs today is a lack of identity, said
Bessmeru‘tykh. “People feel them-
selves just specs of dust without an
ideology,” he said. “For 70 years,

Marxism and Leninism gave the Rus-
sian agoal to work towards in life. The
Russianmindnoeds that philosophy of
a goal to obtain in life. This is part of
the crisis right now.”

Other problems in the former So-
viet Union include a crisis in theory, a
crisis in social institutions, ethnic ten—
sions, and runraway inflation.
Bessmcrtnykh said.

“In 1990, the gross national product
dropped by two percent. In 1991, it
dropped by 13 percent. Ibelieve d1at
the economic crisis will reach its cli-
max by 1993,” he said. “Our ethnic
problems are now also surfacing. In
1991, we registered 150 inter-ethnic
conflicts, some 20 of them registering
large losses of human lives.”

Bessmeﬂnykh hopes that theUnited
States will continue to be patient with
the fortner Soviet Union.

“Already, the West seems to be fed
up with issues in Russia. It is rare that
you hear about the state of democracy
in Russia or the human rights prob»
lems. Now, the only things you hear
are about are the Russian armaments
and the danger of Russia falling under
the wrong leadership.”

Bessmertnykh is confident that
Russians and Americans will become
friends with strong ties in the future.

“The United States should make
an attempt to establish close contacts
Willi Russia," he said. “With its vast
markets and many people, we in Rus-
siatu'eno longcrenemies, only friends."
