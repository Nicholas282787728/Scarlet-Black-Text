When art meets the
political machine

It has'been more or less impossible to remain impervious
to the onslaught ofcampaign advertising and political imagery
that have permeated the media this year. Images ofpropaganda.
an art form in their own right, have been everywhere.

Inspired by Barack H. Obama's historic inauguration, I enn-
baiked on a mission to discovel artful propaganda and political
art. Two artists stand out in very different ways.

Perhaps you've hcard of Shepard Faircy, the street artist,
Rhode Island School of DeSign graduate and selfeproclaimed
“absurdist propagandist." Based in Los Angelcs, Fail'ey has a
long list of accomplishments in the ﬁelds of alt and design.
Much ofhis woik is featured on the website Obey Giant, which
specializes in “propaganda cnginecring,"

He is, however, best known for his “Hope" poster featuring
President Obaina in shades of red, white and blueThis image,
compared to such iconic portraits as that ofChe Guevara, en-
capsulates much of how the media trumpeted Obamals bid for
presidency. characterizing Obama as the symbol of hope and
change in American politics.

 

Though Fairey's poster was not ofﬁcially affiliated with
Obama's campaign, the campaign approved ofit and took steps
to improve it. The image originally appeared with the wold
“Progress” at its base, but was changed to “Hope" by Obama
officials to be more in line with the campaign’s message.

Fairey is very clear about how he sees the purpose of his
work. He hopes that his art fosters questions about the imagery
rhatwe, the public, are inundated with on a daily basis, So much
of the visual stimuli that line our streets represent commeice
and control, he contends, rather than personal expression

With this approach, his work quickly becomes about reaps
propriation. By using in his work the very aesthetic techniques
employed by corporate marketers to send a different kind or
message, Fairey reconfigures the way we view advertising.

But political imagery can sometimes fail to unify the public
and reinforce positivc messages ofchangﬁindee‘d, at times. it
does just the oppositeTalte Czech artist David Ccrny's sculpt
titre commissioned to commemorate the Czech Repuhlie's turn
as President of the European Union.

The sculpturecalled Entropa, depicts the 27 EU. countries
laid out on a flat, mosaicslike plane mounted in front ofa build—
ing, with each country represented through cliches and stereo
types. According to T/w Prague Mimii‘m‘, Italy was formed by
a soccer field, Bulgaria by a series of “Turkish toilets," sweden
looks like an Ikea box, and England is conspicuously absent
from the sculpturb‘hintﬁng] at its dubious relations to the
EU," according to the Monitor,

Multiple governments have called for the sculptures re
moval. The Bulgarian government, unsurprisingly, has been
espegially vocal about their displeasure.

Ccrny' originally claimed to have collaborated with 26 other
artists from around Europe, But after being challenged by the
Czech media, Cerny acknowledged he had made up the names
rind that he made the mosaic with two friends.

Headlines erupted following the horix's exposure, proclaim- .

ing that the artist “duped” the commissioners. “We knew the
truth would come out," Corny said to the 1330 “But before that
we wanted to find out ifEuropc is able to laugh at itself."

Cerny has incited similar public responses in the past. In
1991 he stirred up controversy by painting a Soviet tank pink,
one that had served as a war memorial in Prague.The political
message that he sends with his art lies more in his choice of
subject matter and the circumstances under which he operates,

Fairey’s work is much more straight forward. Few will ever
forget his iconic red, white and blue rendering OFT—lope" image
that has been slapped on everything from bumper stickers to
Urban Outﬁtters tees.

It does good to be reminded that a diverse array ofpolitical
art exists and contributes to public consciousness. Can art teach
us to laugh at ourselves and, indeed, at our politics? Can Fairey
transform the way we view billboards along the highway?

The question of politics in art opens up broader quest ns
about the power of politics in permeating our everyday lives:
Cctny and Fairey's works represents two very different ways
that art can take on a political edge and, perhaps, send a mes-
sage ro its viewers, Both artists’ work sheds new light on politit
cal and corporate structures, encouraging; reanalysis and critical
thought. Hence the art crush.

Pazza- alooza hits Gardner

Let's face it, we prob-ab y agree on most facets of Friday
night's Mucca Pnzzn show in Gardner Lounge, so I'll get
the foregone conclusions out of the way.

Mucca Pazza is awesome. The band‘s members met
and exceeded expecmtions with a raucous, frenzied, ceilings
busting show, with the ZDtplus eelectieally dressed members
rarely staying confined to the stage and often interacting
with the crowd. The music crossed genres and demonstmt-
ed the band's versatility, with violin solos, accordion playing
and manic trombones all ﬁtting perfectly into the perfors
mance They brought cheerleaders. Former high school
band members wanted to be them. Pretty much everyone
left happy.

But the feeling that lingers one week after the fact isn’t

a speciﬁc song or a memorable performer, but instead the
show as a whole. one that demonstrated what an awesome
Grinnell concert experience should be,

Mucca Pam didn't give us the stereotypical show, one
defined by a few great songs and everyone watching the
band play its instruments onstage. Instead, they produced
an hour of drunken Friday night revelry, a fantastic party
that lured in a packed houses Those in attendance left with
the kind of hazy but awesome memories of Grinnelljaris
standing on couches with pom-poms, steam pouring out
open windows, and marching band chaos. It was a quintes—
sential Gnnnell experience. When can they come back?
