chooses to focus on three apolitical men who gt) off to Vietnam to light,
and what eventually happens to them is a paradigm ofwhathappened to
the United States during the war. ‘

In a gut~wrenching sequence. they are forced to play Russian roulette
While their Viet Cong captors bet money on who will survive. Michael
(Robert De Niro) keeps them alive and engineers their eventual escape.

Michael goes back to Saigon where he witnesses the fall of the city and
the eventual fate of his comrade.

Cimino’s first major work. “The Deer Hunter" won five Academy

Nosferatu the Vampy

The second entry in the German Film Festival is “Nosferatu the Vam»
pyre” (1979). a gentle evocation of the 1922 classic which was the first
important fllm of the vampire genre. in his remake. German director
Werner Herzog attempts to strip away some of the sensationalism and
campiness which has been attached to the Count over the years and to of-
fer us a thinking man's Dracula.

The Count is played by the versatile German actor Klaus Kinski. and
beautiful Isabelle Adjani is the incredibly pure Lucy whose neck is what
the Count’s dreams are made of. With his legion of rats, Dracula spreads
plague and terror throughout the city. and virtuous Lucy offers herseli to
the Count in order to destroy him and save the city. Lying on a bed
strewn with flowers. Lucy is serene ili her sacrifice as Dracula drinks his
iill and stays unintentionally until the sun is well up. thus insuring his
own demise.

In his ﬁlm. l-lerzog tries to humanize the Count by showing his
loneliness and longing for love. The iilm recalls a world oi‘mystical in
nocence in which ladies still swoon. and it is iunny without being silly and
eerie without being foolish This reverent remake is showing Friday
(tonightl. April 13 at9130 p.ni. in SL. 107 min.

The Trial

The first ﬁlm Since “Citizen Kane" to be released in the form that the
director Orson Welles intended. “The Trial" (1963). part of the German
Film Festival. is a somewhat freely adapted Version of Franz Kafka‘s
novel. Labeled a travesty. the movie achieves an effect through
cinematic means that conveys periectly the terriiying vision of the
modern world that characterizes the novel,

The iilm is basically the story of Joseph K (Anthony Perkins) who is
arrested in a nameless country for a crime that is never explained to him
and is eventually tried and condemned for the unspeciﬁed crime. In a
fable narrated by Welles at the beginning. the theme is put into a nutshell
in order for the audience to better understand the movie. Welles also ex-
plains that the logic of the story is the logic of a dream 7 of a nightmare.

”The Trial" is completely a Wellesian creation. His presence is felt in
every from and angled shot, and in addition to playing the crucial role
at Hastler, the Advocate, Welles dubbed eleven of the speaking parts.
This extraordinary. hallucinatory cinematic nightmare shows Saturday.

Dirty Harry

The final cinematic offering for the weekend is “Dirty Harry" (197)).
Now, here is a real police story. This genre piece has a genuine ieeling
not only {or the danger of a cop’s life but also for the monotony and
frustrations, Also included are riveting action scenes and ﬂamboyant
violence.

In “Dirty Harry." Clint Eastwood plays a maverick San Francisco
policeman named Harry Callahan who got his nickname because he’s a
dedicated cop who always draws the dirtiest assignments. When a
psychopathic killer. who ironically enough wears a peace symbol, is ter-
rorizing the city. who else but Dirty Harry can save the day by ridding
the streets bit is maniac? Harry does this but the legal system being
what it is. the killer is set free because of technicalities. Having tried
legitimate channels. Harry now takes the law into his own hands. With
the killer’s release. the audience is dished up a big second helping of
violence. and Harry is given the chance.to blow the punk's head off.

The film's director. Don Siegel, a master ot the action ﬁlm. raises the
level of lethal violence another ugly notch with “Dirty Harry." With a
suitably hard-boiled script and a pulsating jazz score. the iilm IS a
remarkably’singlerminded attack on liberal values. Suspenseiul. brutal,
and exciting. this rightrwing fantasy can be seen Saturday. April H at 10
