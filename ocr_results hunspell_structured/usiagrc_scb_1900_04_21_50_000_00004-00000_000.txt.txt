ivith hearty applause as she took
the chair at the beginning ot the
program Friday afternoon. The

Miss Brownell sang in st very
pleasing way and kindly l‘espondr
ed to an encore. Miss Margaret

ciety. gave a very good impression
and held the attention and inter-
est ot her hearers, closely.

As a preparation for next Fri»
day’s lecture, Miss Nellie Clarke
gave a talk on the lite and works
of Edward Everett Hale. His
life has been so full and complete
that it ftii'nisllcs good material for
a talk, and Miss Clarke made this
one especially good by her ready
and informal manner. A review
of the late book, “To Have and
to Hold,” was very well given by
Addie Morrison

For extcmporancous work,
Martha Fulton discussed the
change in the Presbyterian creed.
Miss Ada Garst gave a review of
the doings of the last legislature
with a personal experience of its
proceedingsonthe day otadjourn»

initiate the new ﬂoor, which had
been laid during the recess.

To ﬁll I'M/sill: of lawn Colll’gI-J-
Last August when I was elcct-
ed Acting Principal of the Acade
cmy it was well understood by all
concet had that it was but a temper
rary arrangement. The reasons
for such an arrangement are as
strong now as then. Prominent
among them was the fact that I
had been preparingioranotnerline
of work. I then desired and still
desire to do that other kind of
work. In View of all these facts,
ltheretore beg leave to inrorrn you
that I shall notbe a candidate for
the position or Principal ot the
Academy ior next year.
Very respeettuiiy.
