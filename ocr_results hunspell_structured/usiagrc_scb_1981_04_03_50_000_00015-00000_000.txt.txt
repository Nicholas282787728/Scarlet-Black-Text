Attacking the Grinnell attitude

To the Editor:

This concerns the "r" grade. lt is not
intended tor the laoulty or administra
tion. It is intended tor a few worried
students. I hope most people will be
able to realize that I am neither ad-
vocating nor opposing the "r" grade
out attacking an “attitude."

At the "r" grade toruin (and
elsewherei. many students have ex»
pressed displeasure at the current
“F"»less situation. There are many
reasons for this displeasure but one
argument presented upsets me to no
end, Some students claim that no ”F"
and a late drop deadline allow students
tother students) to manufacture a good
G.P,Ar .

I don't care about the other
arguments tat least in this letter); I
would just like to say to the students
who feel homered about “manuiae
tured" G.P,A.s that you're screwed up.

Do you manutaeture your G,P.A.7
You don't? Then why do you care it so
meone else does? I mean why should
you give a damn whether someone else
“manulactures” his GPA. or not?
What dill’erence does it make to you ll
he does“! How in the world does so-
meone else's “manufactured" G.P A.
atiect you?

0h, 1 know, it‘s not tair. Hey, you
have the opportunity to "manufacture"
your G.P.A. too. The other guy is just
taking advantage of an opportunity al-
lorded to both of you (Whether it is
“morally right" or not is not an issue
since “fair" in this case describes a
claim that someone has an “undue ad
vantage" over someone else.)

But that makes his GPA, seem bet-
ter than it should be, right? Sort or like
real and nominal values. 50 whatl’!
That's his G.P.A., not yours, Once
again l ask, why should you give a
damn about the other guys G.P,A.7

But that makes my G? A look
worse. So you want to take away the
other guy's “manuiactured” G.P.A. so
yours “looks" better, That's right‘
don't make yourself better, make the
other guy worse so that you “look" bet
ter. Don't improve yoursell and climh a
notch to get ahead, make the other guy
[all a notch so that your position
"looks" higher
