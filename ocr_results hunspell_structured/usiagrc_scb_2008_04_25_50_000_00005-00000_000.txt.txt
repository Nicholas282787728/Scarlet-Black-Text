You may use PVC pipe, a deck ofcards,
rubberbands and your imagination. You have
eight minutes starting now. Gol”This is what
some of Grinnell Middle School’s students
might hear on any given day While college
students waver under the pressure and time-
crunch of tests, papers and reewrites, middle
school students down the road at Grinnell
Middle school are tackling mental challenges
in a slightly different way by competing in the
Destination imagination program,

The Destination Imagination program is
a national competition which, according to
its website, “[is] a community-based, schoolr
friendly program that builds participants
creativity, problem sol rig. and teamwork in
meaningful and enjoyable ways,’ All six of
Griunell's DI teams qualiﬁed for and camper
ed at state,with the school's 5th and 8th grade
teams even qualifying for the event’s global
competition at the Univeisity ofTennsssee on
May 20,

Cathy Sonnichsen is the director of the DI
teams and guides students in preparation and
practice for competitions. Under sonnichsen’s
leadership this year, two teams placed first in
the state level competition and are now headed
for globals.

Sonnichsen, wife of Grinnell Varsity Volt
leyball and Softball Team Coach Tom Son-
nichsen, said that while she provides guidance
to the participants. she enjoys how much ofthe
responsibility isplaced on the students them
selves, “I only help them and show them how
to make decisionsiotherwise it's all on their
own," said Sonnichsen,“1t’s all about creativity
and teamwork, and that's why I love it."

Part of D1 competitions consist ofa Cen-
tnl Challenge that students must address in
one of the categories of Technology Drama,
Structure, Improv and Drama Tech. The cat-
egory that a student is in determines the type
of project they complete, At the competition,
students have 30 minutes to prepare and per
form a final product and a skit related to their
category [or a panel of judges,

nent and are based on a theme. The global
competition's theme is “chorific,” so students
must address an issue relating to daily chores.

At the stateelevel competition, Maile
Leathemrtiietz, daughter of Henry Raetz,
Religious studies, was a part of the 7th grade
Tech challenge. The Tech challenge requires
that students focus their presentation on the
theme machines and technology, “The chair
lenge was to create a vehicle that has to com—
plete obstacles throughout the skit," she said.
“Our vehicle goes up ramps, through tune
nels and weaves,"

Throughout the competition, students
are encouraged to use recyclable materials to
complete the challenges. “We used an old re
more control cai, took it apart and made ade
justments," said Leathem-Rietz. “You would
get less points it you just used a cat that you
bought in a store,"

While they may prepare in advance for the
competition's Central Challenge, each team

also faces an Instant Challenge, about which
they receive no details ahead of time. “You
have a certain amount oftime to solve a prob
lem creatively," said Leathem-Rietz.

Also on the team is Alex Mitchell, the son
of Biian Mitchell, who works at Burling Lie
brary's circulation desk

After the end oftheir challenge and Instant
challenge, the judges assign points and decide
on a winner to advance through the regional,
state and global stages. While LeathemeRietz
and Mitchell's teams' bids ended at the state
level to state, the 5th grade and 8th grade teams
have advanced to the global competition,

Sonnichseii and her teams are currently
raising money for the D] teams to go to aa-
tionals and will host a fuiidraising showcase
April 25 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm. “The teams
will show their .nain challenges in the mini
theater, and the instant challenges will be held
in the cafeteria." she said. “We will have des-
serts there also. "

Probatlon

from P- 1 ‘being present on campus,
which administrators felt was too liberal a deft
inition. Under the new guidelines, athletes can
be prohibited from certain kinds ofparticlpa-
tion in their sport before they are suspended
from the campus,giving administrators greats
er ﬂexibility in such issues,

The Committee on Academic standing
proposed the new policy, which was then ap-
proved by all the school’s varsity coaches.The
new policy will only affect students who pare
tieipate in varsity athletics now. But in the fur
ture, groups may tier their probation policies.

Administrators also hoped the change
would provide: more gradation in addressing
students'acodemic problems Prior to the new
policy, a student went straight from standard
academic probation, which involves no prohi-
bitions, directly to a suspension. Administra-
tors said they needed an additional interme
diate step before suspending a student. “Ifw:
almost suspended a student,we need to send a
really strong message that their focus should
be getting their academic performance in or
der," said Chenette.

Athletes may still participate in practices
and on-campus team events, though Chenetre
said he thought it was “a little counter to our
message.“

The Academic Affairs ofﬁce estimated
that an average of six students are placed on
regular academic probation each semester.
Students who have just remrned from a period
of academic suspension are also automatically
placed on academic probation when they re
turn to campus. So far, administrators say, the
new probation has only affected one athlete.

There are no speciﬁc guidelines as to what
would place a student on academic probation,
and students are dealt with on a case-by—case
basis.

Van Kenyon ’10, a member of the football
team, said he does not think that the new pols
icy will have any impact because coaches and
teammates already look out for the academic
performance of their teammates. “I think that
especially in terms ofthc football team we have
a community in place where we look out for
one another," Kenyon said. “The people who
are really involved tend to make sure that they
are on top of things academically, and even if
they're struggling, there is generally a lot of ac
ademic support, especially from the coaches."

Alums attempt to put mandapa overshrine

iii/NATE BONNELL

on Saturday April 5, two men arrived behind Noyce earrye
ing a large wooden frame with a piece ofcloth stretched over
the top. They placed it over the shrine to the Hindu deity Ga-
nesha and quietly left.

For alumni Scan Chittym and Andy Cotton '07, the cow
ering they erected, though it lasted only a few days, was a long
overdue gesture ofrespect to the shrine.

The shrine is a memorial to Jamison Russell Curran '01,
who was robbed and killed while studying in india in i999,ace
cording to President Russell K. Osgood.The shrine consists of
a small statue otGanesha sitting atop a four-foot pedestal with
a plaque telling Curran's story. His family decided they wanted
a memorial to him on campus and paid {or the statue, Osgood
saidAt the installation, a Hindu pandit came from Chicago to
sanctity the shrine

Chitry said he put up the shelter, which was eventually
knocked down by the wind and later removed, because he re
membered that when he was a student at Grinncll many stir
dent initiatives called (or building a covering, called a mandap,

7 but that nothing had been done. I no longer felt constrained
by monetary issues or having to deal with the administration,
said Chitry.“l just did it."

Chitty said he designed and built the structure with help
from Cotton. He said the simple wooden structure was partly
to draw attention to what he sees as an inability on the part of
the administration to follow through with things, He said that
it was easy to “fix it with 30 dollars worth of material,"

Chitty said that his understanding was that leaving the
shrine uncovered was disrespectful toward the Hindu religion.
Though he is not Hindu, Chitty said the shrine is a “meaning
ful place,"and that‘as a Computer science major. it was on my
path every day [on the way to Noycej,"

Tim Dobe and Ed Gilday, both Religious Studies, said
they have long called for a mandapa to be built over the shrine.

"Theres a pretty strong tmdirion that it should be covered in
some groups [oinnduism], said Dobe

Dobe said that he wasn’t sure why no one had previously
covered the shrine but said that the administration was largely
responsible. "Every time it has come up, it's been frustrated by
the administration,"he said. Dobe said the reasons for the delay
were unclear to him, but that the administration may not have
wanted it to become too large a structure.

Dean of Religious Life Deanna Shorb said that past pror
posals to have a mandapa built have often fallen by the wayside
as summer or other breaks have come up. She also said that any
proposal would have to be approved by Osgood, and that so far
no proposal has made the cut,

Osgood said that he had only seen one plan to erect a
mandapa and that at 12 feet wide, it was too big for the grove
behind Noyce,“That grove is supposed to be a quiet place.We
don't ﬁddle with it, we don't cut trees down,"he said. “The trust-
ecs like having lors of green space."Osgood also said that a
mandapa was never part of the original plan for the shrine, and
that there has been no suggestion as to where to get the money
for one.

The structure fell over in the wind a few days after they
put it p and was removed sometime later. Associate Director
of Fac 'es Management Les Ollinger said he had not heard
anything about the structure or who removed it.

Dobe said that while the stiuctute was not a successful
longrtenn solution, it was a valuable reminder that the shrine
should he coveredt‘Tot my own part,"said Dobe."Tliis is a re-
minder that we need to take new initiative to get it covered. I'm
not condoning the structure, but] think it’s good that students
are continuing to act on their sense that something should be
done.”

Until something more permanent is installed, an anony-
mous student has left Ganesha with a green knit scarf and a
matching hat to keep warm in inclement weather.
