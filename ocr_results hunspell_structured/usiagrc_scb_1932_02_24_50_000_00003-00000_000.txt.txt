Organization

Snead
of Political Club

Temporarily

Niamecl Chairman

Temporary formation of the Grin-
nell College Republican club was
rnnde Tuesday evening at a meeting
of a dozen Grinnell students with
Charles K. Needhain, chairman of
the Poweshiek county Republican
central committee, in the Grillncll
Register building,

Plans were made to appoint coni-
mitecmeu in each hall of the dormi-
tories, women representatives in each
cottage, and a committeeman for stu.
dents living in town. It was also
tentatively planned to send a dele-
gation to the Poweshiek county Re-
publican convention at Montezuma
March 12, and the state Republican
convention at a later date.

Sueed Chairmen

J. Richard Sneed was named tem-
porary chairman of the club Tuesday
evening. Harley stipp was elected
secretary, and Almon Dewey, pub»
licity secretary. It was announced
that the club will support no partic
lar candidate for Republican pre
dential nominee, and has not yet
drawn up its platform.

A public meeting of the club, to
which all Grinnell college students
will be invited, will be held before
March 5, at which time Charles Raw—
son, Des Moines, national Republican
committeeeman from Iowa; Harrison
Spangler, Cedar Rapids, chairman of
the state Republican central commit-
tee, and Miss
Mount Pleasant, national Republican
committeewoman from Iowa, will be
speakers.

To Complete Organization

More definite organization of the
club and appointment of hall and cot-
tage representatives is expected to
be completed this week.

Organization of the local club fol-
lowed a letter from Fred Lukas,
Washington, D. c., secretaiy or the
national Republican committee, and
correspondence with Rawson and
Spanglel'.

Similar organizations are being
.formed at Coe Emil Cornell colleges in
Iowa as well as in other colleges
thruout the country.

Finals in the men's intramural
basketball tourney will be played next
Saturday, when the A and B teams
of Smith hall meet the Gates quin-
tets; Langan and Rawson mix, and
Clark and Dibble play. Dibble leads
the race, having won Six games and
lost two.

Grinnell Menu Praised
in Beloit College Paper

Objection to men at Beloit col-
lege, Beloit, Wis, made by a coed in
the student newspaper, “The Round
Table,” met with a reply recently
both in the news and editorial col-
umns of the publication, in which
Grinnell menus, used as a model, were
praised.

In the student Forum is an article
which says, in part, “The treasur-
er’s office informs us that the meals
used in the halls are always at least
equal to those served in Hotel Hil-
ton, arid other foods are the best ob-
tainable in local markets.

“Three times as much fresh fruit
is being served this year as last;
canned goods are the highest grade
offered; seconds on milk are always
available and usually more than one
portion of other foods may be had.

“Sometimes, it is admitted, an un-
usually large demand for seconds re—
sults in a deficiency. Menus are
chosen from Smith, Vassar, Wellesley,
Wisconsin, Carleton, Grinnell and
Battle Creek sanatorium.

Copies of all these menus are filed
and examination shows them to be
well balanced."
