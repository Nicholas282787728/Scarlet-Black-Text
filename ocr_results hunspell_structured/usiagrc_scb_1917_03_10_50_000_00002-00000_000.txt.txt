This ’1

with the lam-‘17 baslieihail season
Just finished, Gl'llmell can once more
“SH. back and think it over."

The scason has heen a good one.
Starting out with a sin-pr e by win—
ning the Nebraska University contest,
the local live has coiitiiiucd to win
games until it has deieatcd all corners
in the Iowa Conference. It has hcen
defeated by only the State University
and low“ state College at nines.

Laurels this year have heen attained
only through pcrsevcrencc o .nthe part
of the coach and his men. Grinnell
thanks them for their efforts in giving
the "old school" the reputation it hasi
this year and hopes that they have
heen repaid piiysically and mentally
for their valuahle time spent.

THE uncut; QUEb '10):

Just because faculty action in rc-
gard to vacation dancing was the last
step in inaugurating the system, i
should not be presumed that students
and others are not behind it.

In fact the movement originated
partly with the students themselves.
Continually have they asked for some
constructivc change. Several times
this year they have presented definite
plans for ivhat they thought was host.
Recently a committee of students has
been conferring with the social com-
mittee or the faculty and the an-
noiiiiceinent or the dancing change
comes as a result of the worn of this
joint committee.

student cooperation will he neces
sary for the success of the change.
.tter hleg tacation dances permit-
ted on the campus, students should ap-
preciate it enough to see that indis—
criminate dancing is not carried on.
Gl'luuell does not want to let it up
pear that she is sanctioning that kindl
of dancing, for she is not. Studentsl
don't want it to appear so, either, The:
standards at Grinncll are at stake and
no student should dance except at the
prescribed times.

We are hoping that Grinnell stu»
dents will see the hroader side at the;
dancing question at their mass meet-f
ing next Thursday night.

Tllll lmn PR ' CONVENTION.

The Cornellian; “The prospect of al
press convention ought to create more:
interest in college newspaper workl
an over the state. There are more
than 20 student piihlicatiens in Iowa,
each trying to accomplish the same
sort of worli and each doing it in their,
own way. We need to get mgcther,
Wlth each other and not only find out
new ways or printing better newspape.”

“The Scarlet & Black’s meeting
some two months ago at Colfax has‘
proved to the editors of the state that‘
lust such a convention is what has
been necdcd to inject a little hit of
enthusiasm into their papers The re '
suits of that meeting are clearly ape
paicnt to the readers of the Grinnell
papilla That is proof enough of the
valuc of the convention.
