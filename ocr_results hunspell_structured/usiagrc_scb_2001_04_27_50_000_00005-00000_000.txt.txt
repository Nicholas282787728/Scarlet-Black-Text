Our picks and pans for what‘s up,
what’s new, what‘s hip, and what to do

Afro Cuban All Stars Concert

Dallas: As ifyou haven't heaid enough about the eoneert this
sunday in the dining halls, in the loggia and just generally allover
eainpiu, I'm going to beat it into your head too, Juan de- Marro
Gonnlcz brings his larpiete hand to the oarnpus, playing the
sounds that we all aisaeiate with Cuba, even though the young
Cuoans brushed all this stulrjust like young Americans brushed
olrlazz in the 505. it should beashoek for this quiet iowa town,
but i think a shoek would be good. The Afro cuhan All start
will be performing April 29m in front orlsuelesbaunr, and this
event is sueh a big deal that the dining hall is going to break in
iron seheduling so that we can all eat dinner at 4:30 before the
eoneert, And For those of you absolutely infatuated with Quad
food, you can request a pienie dinner to take out to the show with
ten or more Friends personally, l'd rather just order a pizza.

Skye: still, Dallas. you rnutt admit that those eiaey soelthoppers
and hippies round a great rorrn orrnusie as well. well, listening to
an outdoor eoneert is always eool. i'iri not so into the perfore

 

rnanee rnyselr, (int looking Forward to spring Wall-L) but I know
that it's going to make a lot orpeople, as Dallas’s dad says, “hap-
pier than a hog in the sunshine." (He doesn't reallysay that scri-
ously) Those erazy Texans.

Dallas: An afternoon outside with excellent rniisie.. sounds
like the perfect day to me.

Mike, the Super Magician and Illusionist

Skye. Prepare to be daz-Aetl, surprised, and illusionaterl (ii)
tonight M 7:30 and 9:30 pm. in Hattis Concert Hall as Mike
super workt his niagie on the earnpus.Tiekets are available at the
Foiurn. but hopefully you've already got ‘em, because they have a
habit or‘disappeanng into thin air" on the day orthe event. Get
there when the doors open a hall hour early to rnake sure you
snag your booty a ﬁne loeation in the open seating style. It's sure
to be superrmaglcnlrlfraglllotlccxpinlldoclous. lust like David
Copperﬁeld. only without the eheesy Tv speeials mid clauelia
Schiflcr.

Dallas: Have you ever seen one of those regurgitation artists?
I saw one on Letterman onoe.. he oould swallow a pool hall and
then bring it baek up after swallowing other ihings to prove it
wasn't iust lodged somewhere. Where would you put a pool bail
to hide it anyways? Just stick it under the tongue....yeah rightl
Anyways. . .I hope he can do that, but i'in riot betting on it. Maybe
he could regurgitate both David Copperﬁeld and Claudia sehilrer
right there on the spot, now that would impress roe.

Skye: What on Earth are you talking about? Pool ballszi don’t

want to hear any rnore about any rnan’s balls. niueh less someone
swallowing his own.

Our Country’s Good

Dallas: That‘s right, gosh darn it. God bless Amuticz. Oh.
wait. This play’s aboutAustmlia. Yeah, hmmm.

Skye: You know. 771mm Newsweek (I can’t l'cmembtr which)
onee had an essay eontest. The subieet was “Good Government."
The winning entry was only two lines long. it read: “Good gov-
ernment. Sit, suty.”Which has nothing to do with this play.

Dallas: Now who's being random? Apparently Tire/tome
mg O/ﬁeer, whieli the theatre department produced earlier this
semester. was just a big sueeess in the 13Kh eerirnry. in faen it was
so bigora sueeess that they deeided to write a play about how this
other play brought together the ﬁrst eornniunity in the British
penal eolony in Australia. Perhaps they should ehange the title
from Our Country? Card (0 77m: F/quu/mi' my sieve Dim Krrle
Same Bowery. The play runs from May 2“4 through the a“ in
Flanagan Studio Theatre. Tickct: available in the box ofﬁce.

Other Stuff You Should See

Skye: well, we‘ve run our orspaee, but we still think that the
following events are deﬁnitely worth your attention. The Young.
Gifted and Blaek Coneerr and spring Wain. on Saturday, Go hear
inspiring gospel rniisie at 3 pm. and sing it gloriously in your
doriri room as you elean up niee tor the rotnial later on. i her you
anything you’ll be hurnrning a gospel hit all thy.
