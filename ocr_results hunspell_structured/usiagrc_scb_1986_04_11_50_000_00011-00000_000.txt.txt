Griffins ready for action

by Blair Davison

The Griffins started spring scrumming
last Sunday, playing the Des Moines Beside
team. While Grinnell lost 10-16, the match
was a close, well fought one

The Griitins are a Caside team, meaning
that the club is one skill level under the
Des Moines team. The discrepancy in skill
levels was most apparent in the passing
skills. Des Moines executed crisper pass
«ing plays than Grinnell. Grinnell, however,
managed to contain the Des Moines team,
and by the end of the ﬁrst halt the score
was 6-12.

The first hali try was scored by fullback
Drew Ibach, Ihach was fundamental in the
Griffins’ defense, completing many long
distance kicks. These kicks allowed the
defense to recover and better prepare for

possible otiensive possession

During the second half the Grillins
played a much more oitensively oriented
game. There were many good runs in'
cluding one by Andy Poland and one by
Chris Knoepfle, Senior scrum halt Dave
Klaiman scored uie second try, but the
Grliiins couldn‘t pull ahead to keep a lead,

This Saturday the club has a good
chance to beat Drake Law School; during
the fall season the Griffins beat Drake 4&0.
Having compiled a tall record of .500. the
Grinnell Rugby Club can look forward to a
winning spring season, Captain Dave
Klaiman said: “It people keep showing up
for practice instead oi playing soitball, we
should have no problem Winning the state
tournament this year."

The Pioneer golters open what zaryear-
coach Edd Bowers terms a “typical Grins
nell building year" this weekend with two
meets in Illinois.

Bowers’ assurance or a strong team was
somewhat diminished when his number
one returner Mike O’Neil, now an assistant
coach lor the team, graduated at the close
of last semester, and his number two
player decided to spend the semester at
Stirling University in Scotland.

However, Bowers is looking to seniors
Mike Blanchi and Jack Hartung and
freshman Clinton Korver to provide the
needed strength, and his doubs about the
team lie in his uncertainty of additional
scorers. Members vying tor the open posi-
tions on the six-member traveling squad
areihe Brothers Painter (Mark and Scott),
Jeti Skelton, Sam Lowe, and Marc Gota
trelch. Of these six, the low [our scorers at
the lohole meets comprise the team score,

During the season, the goliors will be
traveling to each of the other five member
colleges of the conferences' southern divir
sion. The team scores from each meet will
be compiled at the end of the season and
awards and medals will be bestowed ace
cordingtv.

Grinnell opens Saturday in a liveateam
meet hosted by Southern lllinois College in
Jacksonville, and travels to Galesburg, ll-
linois, on Sunday to compete in a meet
hosted by the defending conference
champs at Knox College,
