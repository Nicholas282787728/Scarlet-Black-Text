THE SILVER bat, emblematic of
the baseball championship oi
Iowa College. which was “'0” by
the team last spring. has been
placed in the trophy case in the
reading room. The bat was sent
to President Gates during the
summer but has not been on ex
hibition until this week. A bit of
engravrng on the hat is an object
lesson in intercollegiate courtesy.
The management of the S. U 1.
team which held the bat last year
hzid the record “Won by Grinnell,
Season of [896” engraved on the
trophy before they sent it to its
present holdcrs, This conrteous
act speaks eloquently of the
pleasant change in the relations
of the schools and we wish to ex
press our thorough appreciation
and commendation. We trust
that if the bat is fated to leave our
hands again, Gl'innell will not be
found behind her neighbor in the
grace with which rshe surrenders
it.

Bishop Vincent's Lecture.

Although not given under the
auspices or any department oi the
college. yet because of the wide
reputation of tlic spcalrcr as a
prominent educator, it is a plcas-
iirc to notice the lccturc givcn by
Bishop Vincent, in the M. Ii.
chin-ch, Monday evening. The
subject given was “That Boy." but
so many dinercnt boys were in»
troduced in the course ot the loo
ture with which to trace boy char—r
acter, that the audience [elt acr
quainted not with that boy alone,
but with the whole race or boys.
It was in no sense it piosy wordr
