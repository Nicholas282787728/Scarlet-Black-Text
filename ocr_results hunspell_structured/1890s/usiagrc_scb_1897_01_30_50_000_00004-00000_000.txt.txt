To the Athletes.

For several years the silver cup

Athletic Association, For the
last two years it has been our
good lorttme to hold it
won both times by a large margin.
By winning next year the cup
will be ours. This statement
ought to be sufﬁcient to crowd
our gymnasium with those who
want to see Grinnell thtls honored
and who are willing to do their
part.

having

With almost the same team as
we had last year and good men to
pttt in the place of those who left
us, it looks as though we should
make it an interesting contest for
anyone who takes the t'csponsllJiL
ityof defeating us, But in the
race of all these encouraging
prospects we are Very liable to
snttcr- a disgt'zlcultll dctcat unless
every person who has any of Grinr
nell's interests at heart does his
part.

Once befote we had the cup ale
most within our grasp but the third
year lost it. Ever one in Grin~
nell can do something to keep
that defeat from being repeated.
Without the hearty cooperation
of your} person we cattnot expect
to put out a winning team.

Our athletic prowess has long
been the wonder at the colleges
many times our size, for, with comr
par-attvcly tew to pick from. we
have been one ot the leading
schools in the west, and the scam
ct it all is the Grinnell spirit.
When Grinncll starts to (loathing
every one pulls together and
something is accomplishccl as a
result. \Vitll this feeling destroyr
ed we are lost. Everyone should
take it upon himself to do all in
his power to encourage and build
up this spirit so that Grinnell in
the spring may turn out athletic
teams that will be up to the high
standard which she has always
maintained.

There is great need of new mn-
tcrial in every department oltmck
work, and in some events we are
lamentably \vealt. Anyone who
has the least bit of athletic ability
is urgently requested to come into
the gymnasium and try tor 50mm

thing. The track management
wlll be there every night from
[our to Six and will most willingly
advice as to what events had best
bottled tor, and will personally
oversee the work of all new men.
