And he makes no such claim [or

for he designed it solcly for the

Harvard Class Day,

The Harvard Cmpmation is at
present considering The extension
of The class day exercises to three
days, This plan will not only ale
low each man more time To enter
Lain his friends but will give the
class as a whole a better opporr
Tumty for entertaining. The
crowds in the past on class day
have caused serious inconvew
icnces and have deprived the (lay
of its pleasures for every one. A
prolongation oi Thc cxercises
would remove This difﬁculty, It
is proposed That on one of these
days a championship baseball
match should be played at Cains
bridge, Similar to The one played
here last year on class day be:
tlvccn Harvard and Pennsylvania.
No deﬁnite action has yet been
taken but the change will prob-

ably go mTc effectiT/M Funny;-
