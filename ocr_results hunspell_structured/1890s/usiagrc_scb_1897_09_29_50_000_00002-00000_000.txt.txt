We are pleased to notice tllat
the spirit displayed in football
practice this week is much better
than that of last. On Saturday
four of the most promising candi»
dates for positions failed to ap
pear at practice. and for no ascere
tainablc reason. No doubt it was
mere thoughtlersncss on their
part, but this does not excuse
their action. The men seem to
have come now. however, to real-
ize the great responsibility which
rests upon them and to enter into
the practice with the spirit of work
uppermost in their minds. The
tootball' management has been
very tortunate in securing the ser-
vices of Harris, ’96. to coach this
fall. Mr. Harris has had excels
lent training in football, and all
can place implicit conﬁdence in
his ability to make the most out
of the material at hand. Wlth
Harris as head coach, assisted by
such well known Grinnell players
as Armstrong. ex-‘gs. Haines, '95,
Reed, '95. Grinnell. '94, Poolev,
'92, Lynde. ’96. and others, Grine
nell will have the best system of
graduate coaches ever seen on an
Iowa gridiron. And we have no
doubt that with the hearty co-op
eration of the players themselves.
our '97 team will he a credit toils

A'r'riztt'rioiv HA5 been called later
ly to the ungrateful, unbusiness»
like way in which the generous
merchants of the town are being
continually called upon to lend
ﬁnancial support to different stu»
dent organizations. The readi-
ness with which Grinnell business
ﬁrms respond to calls of this sort
has long been a matter of remark,
but apparently not of apprecia-
tion. Every college enterprise,
from the Y. M. C, A. endowment
fund to the latest Y. M. C. A.
handbook, has evidently been

 

considered a legitimate ﬁeld for a
canvass of the town. There ml:
things in which the ﬁrms not only
have a pelsonal interest but which
they also ﬁnd it is to their advan»
tage to support. As examples
might be cited our coach fund.
ﬁeldsday medals, and the proper
media oi advertising. But uhen
the same demands are made in
support of projects in which the
merchants have no personal or
business interest, or in which otlle
ers are ﬁnancially interested, or
woeful lack of business methods
is shown, as well as of “a lucky
sense of favors to come."

JUST an this time athletics occu»
py every important place inthe
interest of the students. but some
of these same students are apt to
forget that athletics require for
their proper support something
more than mere enthusiasm. It
Costs money in many ways to
keep the athletics of the school in
running order. The Athletic
Union undertakes this ﬁnancial
management and assumes all re
sponsibility. The oFﬁcers of the
Union give their time and efforts
but are utterly powerless it the
students, alumni and business men
do not give adequate ﬁnancial
support The alumni and busi»
ness men are doing and have done
their share. It now remains for
the students to do theirs, There
is no easier way ot accomplishing
this than by joi ing the Athletic
Union and paying the required
semester tax, In doing this the
student is not fulﬁlling a behest
of charity but meeting a plain
duty halt way—a duty trom which
he can not possibly escape unless
he is willlng to declare himself in-

terested in no degree in the ath-
letic success of the college, in
which case he practically expatrie
ates himselt. Joining the Union
is a small thing for each student
to do but it done may be the
means oi accomplishing much.
