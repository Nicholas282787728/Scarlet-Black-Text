litill look ellfletiy for news from
\lanllattan ﬁeltl nhere the Yale
and Princeton teams meet in lilt‘E
supreme contest at the ftiotballl
season Both teams go into the
game calmly conﬁdent. Neither
is making big boasts. both young
nizc the prowess and strength lot
their opponents, and content
themselves by saying they intend
to give a good account to their
supporters. The record thus iaii
shows Plinceton in the lead fol
the season, but Yale has a peculittri
‘hahit ot rounding into liertect‘
shape just in time to administel a;
