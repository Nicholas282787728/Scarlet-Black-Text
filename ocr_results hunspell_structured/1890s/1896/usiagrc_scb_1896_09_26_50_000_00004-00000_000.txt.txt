Football Coach.

The football management were
greatly disappointed during the
s minor to learn horn iii. Bergen
that it would be impossible for
lirm to return as coach for the
team this tall. Their disappoint-
ment shared by the whole
school, who, during Mr. Bergeri's
two seasons with the team have
acquired a high regard {or him
personally and place implicit truth
in him as a general on the football
ﬁeld.

Manager Macartney has lost no
time in securing another
and, ably; sistcd by Mr.
iii Iris search,

coach

Ber-gen
has had the good
fortune to obtain for this position
Mr: Ms. Blake, who was full
back on the champion Princeton
team at '93. Mr. Blake is ex
pected Monday morning and will
begin \VOI'k at once. He is liiglir
1y recommended and will have
the full conﬁdence of the team
from the ﬁlst.

the past week has been so en-

predicting a creditable record.

The interference has been get-
ting under way quicker and is run»
ning faster than we remember to
have ever seen it before. This is
due largely to the new material
which. though light, is very
speedy. To be sure the inter—
terence is ragged but that difﬁ-
culty will be overcome with more
work.

These encoriragingresrilts have
been brought about largely by
the efﬁcient coaching at the grad

We do not give individual meri-

therefore it would be unjust to
them to criticise their playing

There are several Cl'llictsnis
which will apply to all the men,
the principal one of which is the
high tackling. It has been her
quently noted that a back after
being tackled oftentimes makes
from three to ﬁve yards on aCr
eorint of high tackling This iault
must be remedied and that im—
mediately. Low tackling is the
ﬁrst thing a football player must
learn, and we hope to see this
fault corrected immediately.

Coach Blake Will be with us the

sider the team in good condition

to receive all the information he
will bring us.
