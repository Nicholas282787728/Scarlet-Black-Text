An Open Letter.
To f/lL' Editor: 17/ S car/e! and lilac/r:
in a recent issue of your
paper there appeared an editorial
regarding an appropriate name
for the Athletic Field. The pres-
ent generation of undergraduates
may not be aware that it is but a
very iew years since iowa College
has enjoyed the privtleges and ad
vantages of such a Field; and it
may not he generallyiknown that
the Class of1893 planned and care
ried through to completion, with
the assistance of the trustees of
the college. the project oi an athr
letic ﬁeld.
In tlle fall of 1892, the class of
'93, desiring to leave some ﬁtting

1, memorial with itsalma mater,p.o.

cured [mm the trustees of the col»
lege the use of the grounds imme-
diately north of the campus and a
proposition was made the Athletic
Union to fence and improve the
same, which was accepted; the
class at the time being granted
the privilege oi naming the ﬁeld.
This latter feature liud been fully

, discussed with and was sanctioned

by the trustees and upon this line
derstandinp the necessary funds
were to he pledged. An inspeo

tion of the minutes in the secrer

tary’s book of the Athletic Union
will show tliatthe proposition with
the above named condition was
hilly acceded to by that associate
tion

The class thereupon raised a
large sum oi money with which to
fence the ﬁeld and in addition ex~
pended further amounts in the
preparation at the grounds. A
surplus of some sixty dollars oi
the amount which the class raised
it is understood. has been used to
help deiray the cost oi cone
structing the present grand stand.

At one time the class of '93 of-
fered to name the Athletic Field
aftera member of another class
provided a certain Sum was raised
for the improvement of the ﬁeld
The member referred to had been
a prominent college athlete who

died shortly aiter his graduation
The class in question, however
failed to raise the fund asked.

'93 has always cherished the
hope oi securing some inrther
anioiintor endorsement in return
for the honor of naming the Athr
letic Field, but thus far has not
been successful.

 

Inasmuch as the subject has
been broached, the class of'93 de-
sires to call attention to its claims.
We believe that wears justly eit-
titled to the honor of founding the
Field and that the right of naming;
it still remains ours.

The committee has evcr kept
in mind the fact that the field has
not been named and at present has
the matter under
eratinn,
