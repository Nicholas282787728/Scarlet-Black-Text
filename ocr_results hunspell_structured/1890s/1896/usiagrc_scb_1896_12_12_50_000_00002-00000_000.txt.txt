TAKE pleasure in presenting
to our readers with this issue a
Iiall’tone cut of the football team
ot’ '96

THE s unnms have given a
hearty to our young
English this week, Mr.
studd. A man who has put his
theories of tile to the test of prace
ticztlexpertence can always ﬁnd
audience among us. This is also
the ﬁrst opportunity this year for
coming into direct touch iVitii tiie
life of the English universities.
Mr, Studd is one of two or three
young men trcni England, who
have come to us in recent years,
and given us a broader insight in-
to practical lite.

Till: FooTuALi. season is over
and the husniess of that depart-
ment of our athletics to which we
look largely for the ﬁnances with
which to carry on the entire sys»
tem is completed, To the credit
or Manager Macartney it can be
said that the team has not been a
lostng ventrire to any considerable
extent, Had it not been [or the

' unfortunate ﬂuke as regard. the
Rush Medical game, the books
would have shown a nice balance
for the season The fact remains,
however, that the Athletic Union ,
in serious ﬁnancial difﬁculty and
unless somethingisdoiie and done
quickly. athletics will have to be
suspended im an indeﬁnite period.
The regist‘ rs‘ books show that a
large number of new students en»
tcred college this year. It safe
to estimate that there are at least
one huntlietl inen nowin college
for their ﬁrxl year, alid a fair pro.
portion oi these mtg/l! to belong
to the Athletic Union. Every

man in school should take an in
terest in supporting our athletics.
It is one of the leading deparle
ments in our college life. \Vere
it not for athletics trite college
spiiit would to a large extent die
out. and this would be a deplor-
able condition tioni every stand-
point. We trust that the new 5tu~
dents will consider this matter
well. It will not require much
sacriﬁce ﬁnancially of each one,
but the sum so obtained would
mean much to the Athletic Union.

THE COLLEGE pins mentioned
in these columns a short time ago
have arrived and are tiow on sale
at H. P. l’roctor's. As was stated
the pins having the word “Honor"
inlaid in gold above the “G" are
only for those wlto have won the

Prof. Ventura.

Next Tuesday evening, Decem-
ber i5, Professor L. D. Ventura
will lecture in the chapel on the
four Italian poets of the present
day, under the auspices or tile
class in Italian which he has been
conducting here during the past
term. Signor Ventnra will doubtr
less have much to say on the con.
temporary literature of his native
country that will be oi interest to

every student, especially as Italian
has at present no representation
in our college courses. The leer
ture will begin at 7:30; admission
25 cents. Tickets may he had at
McConnell's.

Mr. Studd’s Visit.

Mr. Studd has succeeded in
making a strong impression upon
our students during the short time
he has spent among us. Perhaps
the secret lies not so much in what

the man said as in his strong per-
sonality. His principal address
was made Thursday evening, in
addition to the two chapel ad~
dresses Thursday and Friday
mornings.

The heart or the message which
Mr. Studd brought to us was cone
tained in some evidences ofCltris-
tianity which he had met with
asa missionary in China. They
were well woven int . he story or
his work on the foreign Field. Two
racrs which seemed to impress
Mr Studd and consequently his
audience, may be stated thus:
The civilization of the western nae
lions under the inﬂuence of Chris
tian thought, as compared with
life in the easl: The remarkable
transformation in the lives of some
Chinese under the teachings oi
the missionaries.
