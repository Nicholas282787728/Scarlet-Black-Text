The Receptlon.

In the past two years the Y. M.
C. A, has demonstrated the fact
that it is a splendid thing to hold
receptions tor the ladies anti gens
tlemen separately betnre they
lreid the general reception. ii
any one had doubts. the scene of
last Saturday evening snr-ciy dies
pelted them, For over two hours
the chapel was ﬁlled to its utmost
capacity with old and new slits
dents, each striving to mat-e the
evening pass as pleasantly as pUSs
sible. To add to the enjoyment
of the occasion an Italian orches-
tra. sojourning in the city tempers
ariiy. had been provided by tr ieuds
of the Christian Associations, and.
hidden behind a screen in the coir
ner ot the room. they disconrsed
sweet music throughout the entire
evening. The Glee Club was there
in a body and sang their new song
entitled. “The Young Lover."
This elicited a hearty applause
and they responded with the
“Scarlet and Black," a rousing
college song. the last words oi
which were drowned in lusty
cheers and college yells. No one
thought otgoing home until l0330,
despite the (act that the faculty
were weilrcprcsented. Theeven-
ing closed with a violent outburst
of class enthusiasm. The spirit
shown was commendable and if it
but continues our athletic teams
this year will not lack for encours
