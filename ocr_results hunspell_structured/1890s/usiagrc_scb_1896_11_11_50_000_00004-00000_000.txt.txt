No true doubted for a moment
but that Michlcan would win but

Il nesota's play was a revelation to

the Ann Arbor men. Their line
was etluttl, If not superior to their
opponents and their-backs would
average up well. Mtnnesota won
her touch dottn by hard work and
kept Michigan's rantons tackles.

Ames has a strong aggregation
ot players, and null hereafter be

'an element irr deciding the clIanI~

pionship oi the state. Next year
she will probably have her two
guards, ttvo tackles, one end and
a half-back of this year‘s team,
thus keeping her most important
players. The Wilson cousins wtll
both graduate and will be severe
loss to them. but wrth 2 good a
llHL' as they hold over, star backs
are not so important.

It seems a pity that the two
teams, .. U. I and Antes. cannot
come tpgether this year. as they
are about equally matched. and a
game between them would be well
worth going miles to see.

The \VOll( of our team, with a
few exeeptrons, was poor. The
line, paiticularly, played a ntedi
oer-e game, and Antes did about
as she pleased with it. There is
one tault we must remedy betore
next Saturday and that Is our play
is too slow, There isa noticeable
lack or ginger tn the play. Ames'
heavy team played a much snapr
pier-game than we did. The sig
nals must he given quicker.

There \vIll be a great shaking

up in the team next Saturday, and
no expect the team to give a betr
ter record of itself, We are con-
ﬁdent that it can and wrll.
