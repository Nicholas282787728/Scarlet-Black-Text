THE GLEE CLUu and Orchestra
Concert which is to beheld in the
near future will doubtless uphold
its past reputation of being the
most popular entertainment of the
year. Measured by the standard
of ability these two associations
are capable olsatistying the most
severe musical critics, whilc re-
viewed from the standpoint of
pleasure, there is probably no
other concert during the whole
year which is so thoroughly en.
joyed. Each year has seen a de
cided improvement in the work
of these two organizations and
this year promises to be no ex-
ception to the rule. The fact that
there has been but few changes in
the orchestra goes to show that it
will render its part in the program
better than ever before, while this
year's Glee Club was probably
never excelled in voice quality,
The weeks of hart]
these two organizations have spent
in preparation for this concert
should call forth an audience
worthy of the labor that has been
spent.

A srcx of increased interest in
the society work of the Academy
has been shown during the past
few days in the reorganization of
the Philologian Society. Although
this society “as unwise enough to
disband early in the fall and thus
lose all the advantages which the
winter term brings to society
work, yet we are pleased to note
that a week ago it reorganized
iviilia large list of new members
who possess the capability of
making a good society. oiie
men’s society in the Academy is
not enough to insure lively intei.

Academy societies should serve

As THE time for the third ans
nual debate between Cornell and
Grinnell college approaches, a ten
words on the subject will not be
out ot place. The iormer debates,
as is well known, have not been
highly successtul from our stand-
point. This, however, has not
been due to inferiority in the der
haters as much as to the lack ol
the support of the student body.
Two years ago when the debate
was last held here.therciras only
a few listening to it. Last year
only one or two accompanied tlicl
speakers to Mt. Vernon. It iioiild‘
bc ridiculous to expect an athletic
team to be successful with such
interest or lack‘ot interest shoun
them and it is no more reasonable
to expect a debating team to win
under such We
never had a better chance of wins
