ITS editorial columns the

fact that the one event In traclt
athletics in rvlrich more than in
any other 5. U. I. “always
been patltelically weak" is the
mile run.’ Recognizing to the
fullest extent this weakness and
desiring to offer an inccntive to
citort along the line ot .marked
improvement in this particular
event. the Instructor's Club of
that institution has offered “
gold medal of a value not less
than twenty dollars." to be given
to the winner of the mile rttn at
any home meet. underthe follow-
ing conditions; “that not less than
ﬁve contestants shall ﬁnish the
race in 5:20 or less, or that not
less than three shall ﬁnish in 4:50
or less." In this event the state
record. held by Clyde. '94 1, C. is
4:45 375; the Dual League record
held by Palmer. er'gS I. C. 5:04-
V; and our home record held by
Palmer, 4:49. The fulﬁllment of
the conditions for winning this

The Cap and Gown.

education have felt the real use
iulncss of the academic costume
and have adopted gowns tor cere~
rnonialo. ordinary wear. Ntlmer»
ous colleges where the gown was
conﬁned to the presiding ofﬁcer
have extended it to the members
of the governing body. to the fac-
ulty or to its senior class. In gen
eral the gown movement has been
a student movement. and while
for the most part it has been en-
Couraget‘l by college and univer-
sity authorities and in some cases
required by them. there are a few
cases where petitions to the face
tllty have been made and refused.
It is difﬁcult to understand why
the right to wear a particular style
of cap. gown or suit need be asked.
oi hotv it can be withheld in view
of the decisions so oiten promul-
gated that a college student nrust
be protected in the sacred right
of wearing any article of decent
apparel that he chooses. even it it
be a silk hat or a cane in the very
early part ot his course.

This somewhat extended abs
straet may seem uncalled for but
in view of the many widely dif-
[ering ideas concerning the cap

who could run almost within the
state record. ln either case the
end desired would be gained. not
by the development of some one
star pcrtormer whose departure
would leave them as helpless as
before. but by the creation of a
tradition, a'standard which the
coming generations of students
would strive harcl to maintain.
Itis evidence of a thoroughly
sportsmanlilte spirit and is in ev-
ery way highly commendable.
even though its accomplishment
will mean for us far harder work
in order to win the laurels of vic-

is proud to do what little it can to
honor the memory of Herbert C.
