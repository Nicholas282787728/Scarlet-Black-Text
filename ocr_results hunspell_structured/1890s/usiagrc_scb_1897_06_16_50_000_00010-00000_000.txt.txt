Two hits in the second, with him

more nntl a solitnry run was scoretl
in the thild. The Iotlrth saw a
hit and two ertorsmatcrializcinto
three runs, on account or peculiar
ground rules and h lest ball. one
man scored in the ﬁfth and thut
cntled Grinncll's lnnrgetting.

Cornell was blanket] in the ﬁrst
two, Davis striking out two men
after the bases were ﬁlled by cr-
rots in the ﬁrst inning. In the
third Kidder singled, went to see
and on an attempted double play
which failed to connect, to third
on n single, and scored on a wild
pitch. In the ﬁlthinnrrnns came
in after the side should have been

retired. i\..'ngle run was added
in the eighth, and Cornell camcto
bat in the last halt of the ninth,
four runs behind. The ﬁrst was
given a base, the secentl singled,
and the next man was hit by a
pitched ball ﬁlling the bases.

The Simpson Game.

Last Monday cnr red stockinged
nggregationofballtosscrsnmusetl
themselves by racing around the
Simpson diamond at Indianola.

When, tnr tllt: twenty-seventh
time, a Simpsonian was late get-
ting t0 the base or was unable to
knock Shep's curvcs where some
Grinnell man wasn't, they admit
tcd that they were beaten 10 to 4.

The work of both teams was, on
the whole, quite good. A feature
or the game was Shepnrcl‘s work
in the be. he enly let one man
walk to ﬁlst. while the “striker
outs" were numerous.

Our hatting was much superior-
to that of our opponents, for the
column of base hits credits our
men with eighteen hits, whilc
Simpson got barely half that mlnl»
bcr.
