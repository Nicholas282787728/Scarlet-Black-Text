Fmoav [more State Register has
been great demand the past
four days because ofa long article
which appeared in that issue en-
titled “Herronism” and written
by one of the trustees ot the col-
lege. It was a severe attack on
the work of Professor Herron and
SCARLET AND BLACK deems it
wholly unjustiﬁable. Even itit
does represent the views ofone
of the trustees of the college it
would seem not to be necessary
to set these opinions forth in the
press. Nor do we. moreover,
think that one is judged rightly
by a few sentences taken from his
writings. It appears that the
work of the department of sociol-
ogy of this college is greatly mis
understood. One might judge
from the frequent newspaper
references that the‘college and
students are interested chieﬂy in
this department. while the fact is
that no other department prob-
ably has such a small enrollment
of students. It is not expected
that students should believe all
that is stated in the class rooms
but it is hoped thatthe work there
will help them to think more and
to form their own beliefsin regard
to the subjects that are under dis
cussion. The work which Profess
sor Herron has charge otseerns
especially capable of doing this
and we feel that there would be a
great injustice done to the stu-
dents if there was any change
made in the department of sociolr

ogy.

cess of the society. The individ-
ual numbers were worthy produce
tions. but the fealure ol the meet
ing which was most encouraging
was the large attendance.

Owing to this being so near the
opening of the term, there was his
tle time for preparation, nevel‘ther
less the numbers were listened to
with interest by all present.

The ﬁrst part of the evening's
program was the swearing In of
the new oFﬁcers by Chaplain En
gelke. This was followed by the
inaugural address by President
Davis. in which he felicitously
thanked the society for the honor
which they had conferred upon
him, and admonished them to lure
ther efforts and success.

Mr. Otis delivered the next
number of the program. Mr. Otis
was on the program for a book
review. and chose as the subject
a lately published book of poems
by Carleton. This was a delight
tul change trom the old stereor
typed form of book review. The
subject was well-chosen because
of the interest which we have in
Carleton. Mr. Otis gavela brief
historical sketch of Carleton and
followed it with a statement of his
characteristics and style, reading
several of his poems.

Mr. Eldridge followed this num~
her with a reading. He chose one
of Kelly’s short stories.

Mr. Deignan then gave a paper
on the subject, “The Philippine
Question," Mr, Deignan’s treat-
ment of this subject was charac-
teristic of him. He took a differ»
ent view of it than we are accus-
tomed to hear, advising against
the annexation of the Philippines
to the United States. His style

was very clear and forceful and
the paper was welldelivered,

The literary program was cons
cluded by the critic’s report by
swan.
