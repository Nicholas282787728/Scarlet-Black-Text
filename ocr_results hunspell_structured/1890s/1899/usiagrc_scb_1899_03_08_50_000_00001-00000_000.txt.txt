The progam ivas opened by Ar-
nold witll a reading showing the
relation of England and Spain to
their colonies. Tlle second nulnr
her was a paper by R. Parker on
“The Future of the Slavoilian
Race." The brotherhood of the
Slav good foundation for
statehood. They consider it their
destiny to regenerate the world.
This characteristic of the Slav is
a great help to civilization. They
are intensely religions. Their cos
operative spirit inakes Russia a
great power.

Ciabb followed with a discus
sion entitled "Raphael and His
Work." The discussion was made
very interesting and
by use of photographs of several
of Raphael's paintings.
Raphael was born at the opening
of modern history. living at the
satire time with Shakespeare and
the discovery of America. He
reached his national fame in r508.
His work is usually divided into
three styles, ﬁrst, reruginesque,
second, Florentine, third, Roman.
These styles are detected most
easily in lils “Madonna." His
“Madonna" is one of the best we
have. “The Transﬁguration" is
considered the greatest picture in
the world.

Extemporaneotis work was done
by Crosby, Jones and ilcheag.
Quaiie and Grier discussed the
question as to whether or not the
executive authority should be
vested in the in imi-

and whether
there should be l‘csti‘lclldils to his
appoilltmcnls. Quaife upheld the
afﬁrmative and Grier tlle negative.
Hamlin, J. E. Parker and Veliii
were volunteers on the debate.
The afﬁrmative won the decision
of the cllair. Professor Wyckoif,
an old member of the society. be-
ing present, was asked to speak,
and gave a few instructive lirrils
for society work. A letter from
J. M. Hanson. '93. was read, in
which he said that all old Chrcstos
were watching the work of the so-
ciety. and that all were interested
in having society work improve
as well as when they were active

members. It is well for the stu-
dents to remember that their so-
ciety work is watched by alumni
and friends of the college, and
this should be an inspiration to
every society man or woman.

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL. IOWA, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1899.

Vol, 5. No. II

 

' Grinnell Institute.

Not to be outdone by the juri-
iors. who rendered the program of
February 8. the sophomores were
given exclusive right to the Insti-
tute program of last Saturday
evening.

Notwithstanding the absence of
many who were with the glee club
at Kellogg, an unusually large
number of members and
visitors were present.

The program opened with a pi.
ano solo by Mr. Kline, who was
compelled to rcspond to a hearty
encore.

President Davis then tickled
the humor of the audience with a
very grandiloquent stump speech,
which l'enllndcd one ofthe Fourths

taincd that Christopher Columbus
was born fourteen hundred and
niilelystlvo years ago.

with a pleasing piano solo, ivas res

ciety.

After a short critical analysis of
the volume of poems entitled
“Under the Scarlet and Black,”
by Mr. Otis, the society was de-
lighted with a comet duct by
Messrs. Dclavan and Thompson,
accompanied on the piano by Mr.
Manatt, An encore was given to
which thc musicians kindly rc-
spondcd.

The last and most amusing fea-
ture on the program was an lmltzle
tiori faculty meeiirig. Petitions
were presented and discussed and

the various classroom cliatucter»
istics of the several professors
were faithfully presented. Mn
Davrs as Professor I-Iendrixson.
Mr. Eldridge as Professor Macy,
and Mr. Thompson as Professor
Emery, were especially apt in im»
itation.

A lively business meeting fol-
lowed the close of the evening's
program. President Davis re-
ported that the property of the
Institute had been insured and the

i-cpori was unanimously adopted

The FlrstGlee Club Concert.

Last Saturday evening the Glee
Club opened its spring campaign
by a concert at Kellogg, The
club reached its destination early
in the afternoon, and passed away
the time until evening by inspects

 

ing all the sights which the town
afforded, but these were exhaust-
ed rather earlier than might have
been desired.

Thc conceit itself was a success
from every point of view save
that of attendance, but the audi
erice made up in enthusiasm what
it lacked in numbers. Every num
her on the program save twovthc
ﬁrst alld lastmwas encored. some
of them twice. the club s nging
Mr Har-
ris, in his whistling solos, and Miss
Smith, in her readings, were an
thusiastically received. Miss
Smith was an especial favorite
with the audience and was recalled
repeatedly.

The work of the club was en~
tirely tip to expectations. Their
singing was spirited, but marked
by excellent expression. With
the week of practice which they
will have had before the hume-
concert, they should make fully
as favorable an impression as the
clubs of other years. Saturday
evening served to show the weak
places in the program. and every
effort will bc made to remedy
these before Friday evening.

The’club made many friends at
Kellogg by their appearance both
on the stage and off, and are prom»
