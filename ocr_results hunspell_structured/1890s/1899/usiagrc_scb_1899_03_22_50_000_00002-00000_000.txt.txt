'THEsERiEsofSnnday afternoon
talks which have been given by
the president for the past six
weeks ended Sunday. These talks
have touched upon questions
which naturally arise in the mind
of every student and have helped
tosalvesome ofthepuzzlingprob-
lems which often come to young
people. These addresses show
that they were worked out with
considerable care, and although
the ideas which are presented are
such that they require careful
thought and attention to get their
tull value, yet they are set forth
in a clear and forcible manner so
that the central points can be eas»
ily comprehended. one talk leads
naturally into the next, and yet
any one is complete in itself.
They are as ﬁne a series of ad-
dresses as have come from the
chapel platform in several years.
and SCARLET AND BLACK would
be pleased to see them published.

THE CHREsToniATliiAh' society
have shown by their action of last
Saturday night that they do not
intend to let the interest which
has been aroused in debating die
out. At their meeting they pror
ceeded to elect six nlcn. from
whom three will be chosen to rep-
resent their society in the debate
with Griniiell Institute next fall.
This is the right step to [2 -e, and
if live debates can beheld iii the
society this spring we may he sure
that theClirc-stos will have astrong
team with wlilch to oppose their
fellow society next fall. Grinnell
Institute will also probably elect
their six debaters before the.close
of the week, so that at the opeiir
ing of next fall term debating at
Grinnell will have better prospects
than ever before in the history of
the college.

THE ENLIVENLD interest in socir
ety work is not wholly conﬁned to
the college societies; the recent
debate seems also to have had its
effect on the academy societies.
At their regular meetings on last
Saturday night the two men's so-
cieties arranged for a joint debate
to beheld this spring and provi»
slon was also made for an orator»
ical contest between members of
the three societies. lf sticli inter»
