OWING TO the fact that so many
of the students will be at their
homes during the Thanksgiving
recess, and that. college work will
necessarily be interrupted, there
will be no issue of SCARLET AND
BLACK on next Saturday.,

WE wtsnto call the attention of
the students to the list of the new
books which have been added to
the college library during the
month of October, which is pub
lished in another partoi this issue.
This list is not inserted merely for
the purpose oi ﬁlling space, but
in order that those students sut‘ﬁ-
cieritly interested in their work to
desire to do outside reading may
be able to learn what new books
have been placed at their disposal.
The additions have been divided
under the heads of the various de-
partments to which they belong.
in order that the search of the stu-
dent may be facilitated in every
possible way. These books, many
of them, represent the treshestand
mostoriginal thought otthe pres-
em. time along various lines or
modern study; others. while per-
haps not so new, are valuable as
standard works of reference. We
hope that the students will take
advantage of the publication of
this list and will use it torthe pure
pose for which it is intended.

Scientific Association.

The program given at Goodnow
Scientiﬁc Association Monday
evening was short. owing to the
absence of one of the members
who was to have taken part.

Cruikshank was the ﬁrst on the
program, giving a well prepared
paper on “Anmsthetics.” After
discussion on ‘rhe paper, Prot.
Norris gave a talk on Prof. At-
water's experiments on the effects
of alcohol. This talk was intros
ductory to a lecture to be given
next Monday evening on “Alco-
hol as a Food.” The program to
be given Monday, Dec. 4th is as
follows:
