Torluoltnow EVENING will occur
the ﬁrst of the Rand Lectures
which will be followed by others
during the week. These lectures
have always proved interesting
and helpful and we are conﬁdent
that this year’s course will be no
disappointment. The social prob»
lems of this country are upper-
most in the minds of many and
knowledge which is to gained
from these lectures in regard to
the methods used in England in
the solving of such problems
should be interesting to all. The
evening hour of seven o'clock has
been chosen for these lectures, as
being the time most convenient
to the students. and all should
make a special effort to alténd.

PREPARATIONS ARE under way
by a committee of the Athletic
Union, tor giving a lninstrel show
for the beneﬁt of the Union.
There is excellent timber in the
College and town tor such an en-
tertainment and we feel conﬁdent
that a really ﬁrsbclass program
will be presented, which should
be heard by each and every stu—
dent of the college. It is the only
entertainment given this year by
the Athletic Union and all can
well afford to attend so as to help
the association is little as well as
to have an enjoyable evening,
The program will be well worth
twice the price of admission and
the Union is much in debt so that
the support of every student is
needed. We see by the Via/rm
Repomr that the minslrel show
given by the Athletic Union at
S. U. I. cleared some 5200. This
means that it was well supported
by the students of the University.
How will the support given by our
students compare with this?

W

LAST EvENlNG witnessed the
completion ot this year's lecture
course, which has been given by
the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation and which in some ways
has been an improvement over
those of the previous two years.

The addition of a concert was per-
haps the most marked improve-
ment. It musical numbers could
take the place of one or two more
of the lectures, the course would
afford even greater pleasure. Durr
ing the year the students have the
opportunity of hearing a number
of able lectures outside of the lecr
lure course, while there is very lit
tle chance to hear musical enter-
tainments. In answer to the plea
that the lecture course is not de
signed tor pleasure's sake but tor
the purpose of furnishing rood to
the mind, we would say that the
other lectures of the year are far
more capable of .ccornplishing
this purpose. It is a deplorable
fact that the lecturer of to-day
cannot hope to be popular with~
out ﬁlling his address with trivial
anecdotes, given simply to amuse
his audience. If, on the other
hand; the course is designed for
pleasure, then we would judge a
musical course tar superior to
laughtervprovoking popular lec-
tures, The course this year has
introduced to students and town
people tour men of considerable
notoriety. but we do not wish to
believe that the lectures were at
all standards by which the ability
of the men themselves could be
judged. With the exception ot
Mr. Cable, who was by far the
most interesting oi the lourspenk-
crs from the point of view of the
student. we are inclined to think
that all have sacriﬁced consider
able of their power and individu-
alily to the popular clamor tor
something amusing. The course
this year has undoubtedly provorl
proﬁtable to llie Y. M. C. A . and
we ieel that they have just];

earned any little sum which has
come from it,
