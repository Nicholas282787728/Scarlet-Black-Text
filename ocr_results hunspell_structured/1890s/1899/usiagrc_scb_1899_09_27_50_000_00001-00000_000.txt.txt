The ﬁrst meeting of the year of
the Clirestomathian Society was
called to order last Saturday evene
ingbyVice—PresidentThiel. Mol-
ler and Grier were appointed to
escort President-elect Owen to the
chair, which they did amid the
hearty applause of the society.
Mr. Owen then proceeded to de~
liver his inaugural address, which
was listened to with close attention
by the society. The address,
which was one of the best heard in
the society in along time, showed
deep thought and careful prepara-
tion. Indeed, the same might be
said of all the numbers on the pro-
gram. Those who took part
showed they had not only Careful»
1y thought out what they wished
to say. but also how to say it.
Judging trom the work done and
the spirit shown at last Saturday‘s
meeting, the Clirestomathian Soci-
ety has before it one of the most
prosperous years in its history.

President Owen, in his inaugural
address, laid special emphasis on
the objects of the society as'out-
lined in the preamble of the con-
stitution of the society. He said
that we should strive after true or
atory, but to obtain true oratory
required hard work; and hard work
is what is expected trom every
member of the society. ‘Hc also
reminded the society that deep
thought was not all that was re-

Mr. Meade then gave a review
of the book entitled “In Tune with
the Inﬁnite," by Ralph Waldo
Trine, who spoke in the chapel
last spring. Interest was added
to the review by the reading of
short paragraphs irom the book,
which gave the society an idea ot
the author’s philosophy of life.

Mr. McCarty followed, \tilth an
interesting address on “The Place
of the Reformer in Politics." In
the Course of his remarks he said:
“Under present conditions, politi-
cal parties ale a necessity. and
since it is the politicians duty to
look after the party, it is the re
farmer's duty to look after the pole
itician."

It being old nienlbcrs’ day, the
president called for reminiscences
from some of the old members.
Mr. Velin spoke ﬁrst, on the
“Chresto,” mentioning some of the
pleasant times that he had enjoyed
in the society. Mr. Risser spoke
