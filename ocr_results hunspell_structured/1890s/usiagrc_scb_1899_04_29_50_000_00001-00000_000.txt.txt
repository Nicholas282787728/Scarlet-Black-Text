The‘Junior Ft‘lay.

The student of Homer often
wisftes tltat lte might catclt a
glimpse oi the real hie oi the
Greeks in that titne “when the
worid was young.” The scenes
irom the Odysxly, which ivere pres
sented by the Junior class last
evening. helped to add hie and
color to the imaginative pictures
which Homer’s inimitable naiia-
tive has given us of tire stoiy of
Odysseus" tweitty weaiy years of

in tlte simple outline of their dress
and household decorations, all
this is so far removed from the
complexity oi our modern liie,
that it requires no ordinary skill
to repioduce it sympathetically

It is often said that many parts
oi Homercould be tlraiiiatized by

our own.

god—like Odysseus” or “wise lei.
emachus.“ An exceptional op.
portunity was given to test the
truth of this statement, for this is
exactly what Miss Bandits has
done in arranging these scenes.
The result is a composition which
undoubtedly has considerable dra-
ntatic unity. not tlte unity how-
ever of an artistic drama, but
much more than would have been
expected. Only in a iew places
do the pants seem awkwardly
joined, wltich is truly remarkable,
when we consider that in the
whole play only two words are
inserted which not in the
Homeric narrative. Odysseus,
it is true, forgot that loyalty to
the original Odysscu’s would bid
him throw the discus without even
waiting to throw off his cloak,
and even then, says Homer, hc
threiv farther than any one else.
But even such slight variations as
this were few.

The characters were on the
whole very well sustained. There
was no lack of individualization,
although possibly some of the

are

characters might well ltavc intro
,duced more varietyinto their act-
ing.

The character oi Odysseus was
admirably portrayed; Penelope
bore herself with grace and dig
itity. The recognition scene,
which could so easily have been
robbed oi its charm by a lack of
understanding of its true spirit,
was caitied out with unusual dige
ttity and sympathy.

Telemachus manifested in
role great spirit and vigor, and his
guest, Athene, did not halt con-
ceal herseli in her human guise.
She scented much more like the
sweet maiden goddess than like
Meittes, whose form she bore.

that this most attractive of Hoe
mcr's women could not have had a
an individual role. The solicitous

trttthfully brought out, Some of
the best acting was done by minor
characters, which contributed
muclt to the production of a vtvid
picture of Iiomericllfe, as tlid like
wise the many admirable bits of
side play by tlte suitors, and re
tatncrs of the court.

Perhapsthe most beautiful and
impressive ieature oi the evening
was the Delphic processional
hymn to Apollo. The exquisite
beauty of the scene will not soon
be forgotten. Some conception
must have been gained from it of
the solemnity and deep religious
ieeling which characterized the
Greek temple worship.

The tableau representing Circe
and her nymphs resembled the
paintings on sonte Greek
vase,

often forgets that to the Greeks
the dance was a form of art and
not merely an amusement. and
the tealization of this fact makes
comprehensible the use oi the
dance in religious ceremonies, Of
this the deeply reverent spirit
shown in the religious dance with
which the Delphic procession
closed wasa most beautiful illuse
tration.

The costumes reproduced very
peiiectly in color and design the
dress of the ancient Greeks. and
many harmonious and artistic cf»

Grinnell Institutes

Grinnell Institute was called to
order by President Dennison at
7:30. After roll-call. which shows
ed an exceptionally large number
oi members present, considering
the iact oi its being springtime.
and there being so many conﬂict-
ing interests. the program was
opened with a speech by Roberts.
He discussed the recent trial of
Quay. and the investigation oi
Croker's methods with the lesson
which they bear to all true Amer-
icans-

The next number was an ex,
cepiionally well prepared paper
by Knapp, on the Czar's disarma-
ment proposition. This being
the gentleman's ﬁrst appearance
on the literary program} it was
especially commendable.

Extemporaneous work was giv-
en by Swan and Campbell on Re~
cent Developments in the Phi]-

(Coutinucd on Fourth Pnge.)
