We have heard a little coinv
plaint regarding the distribution
of the papers last Saturday evening.
Allho it is something to be regretted
it was unavoidable under the
circumstances. but to assure our
readers that hereafter they will
tI// receive tlteir paper ttpou the
evening of publication. wewish to
uttttethat arrangements are now
made to deliver the papers direct»
ly to the subscribers when the mails
are not available for the purpose.

Each Scitmu of the year has its
special lines into \\'l\IClI all the en-
orgy of the institution is put and
the sum total during the year
changes but little. This tradition
should not lie allotted to continue.

satisfactory. Cleanliness in the
gymnasium is of too great imporv
tance to be neglected.

The work of the I. C. eleven last
week was very gratifying to tlte
many friends of the college. The
tnctics seemed to be different from
any previously used here. The
team is much stronger on the de-
fensive than ever before. Much
improvement was noticed in the
work of the ends who got down
the ﬁeld on the long punts with
remarkable speed. The new rules
have succeeded in one thing and
that is that individual play, aside
from team work, is more marked
thanin last years game. This
feature alone has made the match-
es of far greater interest from the
standpoint of the spectator.

Next Saturday the football team
plays its ﬁrst out-0f~10wn game for
this year. The Rock Island has
made the low rate to Des Moiues
of one fare for the round trip. pro-

- vided one hundred and fifty tickets

are sold. A large number should
avail themselves of this offer and
support the team by their presence;
such encouragement will do much
toward winning the game. Show
the boys that you are interested in
their efforts and they will appreci-
ate it.

The University of the city of
New York will erect a new build-
ing on the old site to he to stories
high and to cost $700,290.
