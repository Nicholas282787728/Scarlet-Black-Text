a book review by Shadbolt upon
the subject of “Tools and the

an elegance in style and expres
sion rarely equalled, This oration
was one‘ of the most ﬁnished that
has been delivered on the ﬂoor
of the Institute for many years.

Frisbic read an interesting pit—
per on Dr. Nansen and hrs ex-
plorations.

A talk on the need of a National
University by Sargentwaslistened
to by an appreciative audience.

The extenlporancous work was
not up to the standard. Row

from a neutral standpoint.

proposed honor system in examie
uations.

Smith gave a few rambling rc
marks on the Inauguration. 1t

extcmporaneous work.

The debate upon' the question,

and considerable reeling was dtSA
played, The aFﬁrlmative was sup-
ported by Armstrong and Brown,

State Field Day Arrangements.

Charles E. Lynde. ’96, has been
appointed as our representative
on the graduate committee, which
is to have charge of the field day
games of the State Athletic Asso-
ciation. John v. Crum is to rep-
resenttthtateUniversity. Each
college in the association is to
have a member of this committee,
which is to be composed entrrely
of residents of Des Moines. Ate
tended to in this manner it is
hoped that the meeting will be
much tnore successlul than when
held at Des Moines in former
years. It is probable that the
meet will be held at the Y. M. C.
A. grounds, which are situated on
lower Ninth street. The track
there is considered to be much
superior to the fair grounds' track
[or the purpose.

Crime“.

The reception given our glee
cltrb at Grinncll last week is well
worthy oi notice by those who re-
member the strained relations ere
isting between S. U. l._ and I. C. a
few years ago. Happily not the
slightest trace of ill reeling has
appeared oi late and the bitterness
of our rivalry seems to have dis-
appeared. No audience could
have been kinder to a home club
than was that Iowa College crowd
Wednesday night. The S. U. 1.
men were greeted with the 'Var-
sity yell and treated handsomely
in evcry respect. This should rc-
mind us that we must not forget
our duties as hosts when the I. C.
clubs appear in town City. We

should take care that the recap»
tion we accord them will not com
pare unravorahly with that given
