Review of the Football Season.

Grinnell has never had a foot
ball team more deserving ofcom-
mendation, nonein which she may
justly take greater pride, than the
one of this year. Probably no
eleven in the history of the lnstlr
tution has occupied so large a
place in the hearts of the students
as has this one. The reasons for
this are obvious. When the sea»
son opened the outlook was
gloomy. Material seemed to be
scarce. and what there was, was
uncommonly light. Under the
direction of the management, the
candidates went to work doggedly
and devotedly to make the best
showing it was possible for Grin-
nell to make. They did it. and
their unusual hold upon the afs
fections of the school is but a nat-
ural result.

Some of the team's most ardent
admirers are men who lined up
withits opponents. men who went
upon the ﬁeld skeptical as to
Grinnell's strength because ofher
light weight, men who tested the
rigidity of her defence and found
it not wanting, who witnessed the
desperate and skillful plunges of
her backs and the splendid exe~
cution of her formations in inter-
ference. The team played just
the kind of game which arouses
enthusiasm and admiration irom
friend and foc.

With poor prospects to start
with. Minnesota, who expected an
easy victory, was played to with—
in an inch of defeat; Carleton,
who expected to win, was pushed
all over the ﬁeld; Ames, who in-
tended to overwhelm and crush us.
was sorely disappointed; s. U.I
who expected a comfortable vrc-
tory, was given an uncomfortable
scare; and Drake, who felt conﬁ-
dent of winning from us by a large
score, was considerably surprised.
From being rated. at the beginr
ning of the season, as third in the
race for the championship,
came as near winning it as either
of our two rivals who made some—
what greater prelensions than we.
An interesting part of it is that
they all expected to have an easy
time with us.

Under some circumstances this
record would not be at all satis-
factory to a school which had had
the championship ﬁve years out

we

 

ofeight, but after all the circum-
stances are taken into considera-
tion. it must appear that Grinnell
has done exceedingly well. She
has attained much nearer the limit
of her possibilities than on many
previous years when the coveted
goal of the championship has
been kicked. The really renrarle
able results which have been at-
tained this year have been made
possible by the superlative eFﬁci-
ency of the coaching of Mr. C. E.
Harris.'96. and the wise policies
and faithful and devoted efforts
of Captain coggeshall and Man-
ager Beyer.

For several years past gaaduate
coaching has been the end towards
which Grinnell's policy has been
working. ‘

The marked success. which has
attended the adoption of this pol
icy, stamps it as a most judicious
one. Mr. Harris' coaching has
been of the highest order in every
respect. Besides developing the
formations and plays to a high
degree of perlection, his person~
ality is a very important element
in the qualiﬁcations which make
him so valuable as a coach. He
is able to enthuse his proteges
with a goodly share of his own
energy and determination. and
Grinnell teams have never made
more desperate stands or more
valiant attacks than this year unr
der his inspiration. He typiﬁes
the Grinnell spirit in the highest
degree and his team has never
been excelledrin that respect. The
difference between Glinnell's rec-
0rd last yearand this yearis nlere~
ly a matterofcoaclling. The mac
terlal in the two teams averages
just about the same,

Mr, Coggcshall has displayed
great wisdom and devotion as
captain. Atconsiderable personal
sacriﬁce he accepted the cap
taincy, arter earnest solicitation.
The position o..ce accepted how.
ever, he devoted himself to its re-
sponsibilities with a zeal and sin-
gleness otpurpose which accom»
plished many apparent impossi-
bilitics. His generalship on the
ﬁeld was almost beyond criticism
and was very largely responsible
for the victory over Antes.

Mr. Beyer has made no notice
able rnrstakcs as manager. which
is saying a good deal. He has

 

been second to no one ln his de-
votion to the interests of the
team. His schedule of games is
the best a Grinnell team has had.
and in all his negotiations with the
managers of other teams he has
been courteous but ﬁrm. Through
his efforts the season has been ﬁ-
nancially a great success. Not
only .has the team paid its way
but it has put the Athletic Union
out of debt. In every instance
the policies adopted by the man-
agement have met with the ap»
probation of public opinion in the

school.
The review of the season would

be incomplete and justice would
not have her due, were the ser-
vices of Mr. Brown. '99, passed
over without mention. Few peo-
ple realize the amount ofinﬂur
ence he has had in the councils of
the management. He hasa most
extensive and thorough know
ledge of football and a very ef-
fective Way of imparting criticism
and instruction to players As
coach of the scrub he has been a
very important part of Grinnell’s
coaching force and hasotten been
turned to for advice in matters
pertaining to the Varsity plays
and positions.

At the beginning of the season
it looked as though Grinnell was
to have a weak team this year if
she were ever to have a weak one.
The crisis has been successfully
passed however, and we may conr
ﬁdently expect a better record
and greatervictories next year.

elect, is agraduate of the Grinnell
High School, and played for sev-
eral years both at tackle and full
back before entering college. In
his freshman year he made the
'varsrty as sub-half. In tsoo he
played leftrtackle throughout the
season, and although his true
place was at full he never murr
nlured, For the present season
his work at fullrback has been
very strong and reliable, although
he has been handicapped by an
injury to his kicking foot. His
linerbuckilig has been véry hard,
spirited and law. On defence he
has played 'quarter and supported
the line admirably. Hts punts

curate. In his hands it may be
conﬁdently prophesied that the
captaincy will be well cared for.
He hasthe entire conﬁdence and
respect of the team and the col-
lege and will handle the men in
the best manner possible,

Douglass has played an excel-
lent end. " On defence he is Ll very
difﬁcult man to get past, being re~
markably strong at getting
through Interference and tackling.
On offense he has proved himself
a specially good ground-gainer.
He has been unfortunate at times
in being turned in by reason of
his anxiety to get into too many
mass plays. His work during his
ﬁrst year on the 'Varsity has been
good at all times. and has develr
oped steadily.

Taft has made an enviable repr
utation as a tackle. Heis skillful
at making openings, and is spe-
cially strong in breaking up inter»
fercnce. He attends strictly to
his work at all times and wastes
no breath in words. Sometimes
he is a triﬂe slow in getting into
the interference.

Hart played a strong and con»
stantly improving guard until his
untortnnale injury in the Ames
game ended his work for the sea-
son. As an old player his faithful
and conscientious work did much
to put the old Grinnell determina
tion into the new men.

Wheeler played a very aggresr
sive game at center. He is quick,
breaks through his opponents line
very frequently and is unusually
successiul in getting down the
ﬁeld on kicks. He isa very strong
tacklel. His main trouble was in
inaccurately passing back the ball.
Capron has proved himself to
be a star guard. He is wonderr
fully swift in interference and
very strong in defense. He has
met his equal not more than once
during the whole season and then
only rn certain respects. As an
all round guard it is probable that
his eqnal has not been in Iowa
this year. His head work has
been an incalcnlable aid to the
team. His main fault has been
loose methods of training.
Fellows at tackle began the sea-
son at a tremendous pace but was
injured in the Carleton game early
in the season. His loss was a
