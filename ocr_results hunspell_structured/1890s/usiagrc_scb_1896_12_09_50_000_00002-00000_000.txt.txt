A SUGGESTION,
hearty approval has been made
that some distinctive name should
he adopted for the athletic park.
It has become the custom to have
such name for the college ﬁelds.
and ill a remarkably short time
the name becomes inseparably
linked with the particular college
or university. We believe the
matter of adopting some such
name is worthy of consideration
by those especially interested in
the Grinnell ﬁeld, and trust that
some name will be suggested up-
on which all can loyally unite,

which merits

IT is of the highest importance
that the attention and error-ts of
the students be concentrated upon
the work of the literary societies
during the coming months. It
the Cornell debate IS an assured
thing, as it seems now to be, the
work of Giinnell's literary socie-
ties will for the ﬁrst time, be placed
in the balance with that done by
the societies oi another college.
and it behooves every loyal Grin.
nell student to do what he may
that this showing may not be to
our disadvantage. Their society
work is the lﬁélturs pt their college
life in which Cornell students take
especial pride, and the interest at
the students as a body, which in
other schools is shaied by other
departments seems to he held tin.
rivallcd by the societies there.
Such support will go tar toward
spurring on lllCll representatives
to their best efforts, and Grinnell’s
debaters must not he expected to
go into this contest without any
support [trim the society colr
leagues ni iitrrnthe. hoot in gen-
eral. They talte up this work not
as indivrtluals but as repl'csentan

 

tives of the school, and the Grinr
ilell spirit should be as prominent
in the encouragement given them,
as it ever was on athletic ﬁelds.
0n
representatives acquit themselves
with ‘fiill justice, and it must never
be said that anyone who sought
honor tor Griiiiiell iii any llne, was
compelled to battle against odds
tor which the apathy of his tel
low students was directly reipnll»
sible The literary societies at-
iord the menus tor encouraging as
well as preparing the debaters for
the contest. and the opportunity
should be accepted gladly. The
membership should reach the
maximum limit. and the programsﬁ
each evening should be given to
audiences which will tax the seat-
ing capacity of the rooms to the
utmost. ii the college is to win
Iatlrels in this line, as she has ill
all other Intercollegiate contests,
