The work oi the varsity is 0an
to very serious Cliticism, Their
team work was much molt: lagged

than that ol the high school. and
their rnterlerence was mostly a
myth. Tire backs. tor the most
part, hit the line hard andlow but
seldom round holes waiting them

The work of the team as a
rvhoie lacked snap arid ginger,
and it is very evident that a radi-
cal change must be accomplished,
if we ale to make a good showina
against Drake on Fiiday.
