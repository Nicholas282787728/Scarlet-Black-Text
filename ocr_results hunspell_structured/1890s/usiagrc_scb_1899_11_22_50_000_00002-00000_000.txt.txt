WE ARE unable to ascertain why
the silver bat has not been sent to
us. The Iowa College baseball
team won every league game on
the schedule last spring, thereby
winning the state championship
and with it the silver hat. The
manager sent for it last spring.
but as yet he has heard nothing
regarding it, As we have won
this trophy and are entitled to
keep ita year, we are naturally
culious to know on what grounds
Cornell has retained it for half of
that time.

THE UNFORTUNATE accident which
occurred at Iowa City last Saturr
day, resulting in the death of W.
M. Stephenson from injuries res
ceived in a class game of football,
may well give rise to the expres»
sion of grave doubts as to the ad~
visability of games of this charac-
ter in schools where the class team
is not a regular and permanent or-
ganization, Football is not a game
which can be played by anyone
who chooses to do so, It is a
game which requires men who are
perfectly sound physically, and,
moreover, men who are in a ﬁt
physical condition to undergo
Violent exertion. When a man
goes into a hard game, as even
class games are very likely to be,
utterly devoid ot any previous sys
tematic training, he must inevitr
ably run the rislc of receiving some
accident more orless severe. It
is accidents clue to this cause which
give rise to a very large per cent.
of the injuries which are dwelt
upon with such prolonged em-
phasis by the enemies of football.
It is very rarely indeed thata man
who has trained careiully iron.
the beginning otaseasonistorced
to leave a game; it is rather the
injuries sustained by untrained
men and immature boys which
swell the list of injuries beyond its
true proportions. For this reason
we would object to class games in

such schools as our own. In larger
institutions, where class teams are
organized at the beginning of the
season, undergo regular training
and have their own games, they
are an excellent means of devel-
oping new men and at bringing
out latent football talent. We do
not deny this, but we do assert
that Iowa College is not large
enough as yet to support such
teams. Class games will untloubt»
edly bring out men who have no
business on a toctball ﬁeld, and
the danger ot serious accidents
will be great,
had a series ot class games which
resulted in a number of broken
bones and a large assortment ot
minor injuries and which did not
prove of any great advantage to
the cause ot football. We have no
reason to hope tor any other re-
sult trom the playing ot class
games this year,

Mme. scalchi.

A rather small, but very appre-
ciative, audience greeted Mme.
Soﬁa scalchi with her concert
company at the stoncchurch on
Monday evening. Almost every
number on the program was en.
cored, and all were greeted with
expressions of approval,

Although Mine, Scalchl was the
star of the company, Mme. De
Pasquali's clear soprano was un»
doubtedly the tavorite with the
audience, and both her numbers
'wereenthusiastically encored. Her
duet with Sig. De Pasquali was
also well received.

Mme. scalchi was heard in two
numbers and was encored on both
but responded only once, with
"Annie Laurie.“

Signor Franceschetti, the barir
tone, was heard totlle best advanr
tage in his ﬁrst number, “Die Pos~
senti," trom Faust.

Chev. Lo Verde was an excel-
lent accompanist, and his solo
numbers were well received.

The whole company was heard
twice in quartette numbers, which
were well received. especially the
ﬁrst, the “Rigoletto” by Verdi,
