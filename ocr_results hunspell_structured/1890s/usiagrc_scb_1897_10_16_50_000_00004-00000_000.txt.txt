Music-Literary Society.
For some time past thelc
seemed to be a neccl of some 01"
gamzation among the students of
the School of Music, which tiould
give them something of the same
opportunity tor emulation and ex-
change at ideas nd practice in
public utterance which Is afforded
the college and academy students
through the literary societies. it
has therefore been suggested that
a MusicrLrteray society he i’orm-
ed oistirrlerits of the School of
Music only, conducted on simi-
lar principles as our regular liter-
ary societies, with the proviso
that the subjects discussed, pm
read, etc, shall deal
some musical topic, some musical
question ot the day, or possibly
with the lift: of some composer,
or some great artist. Thls would
he good practice tor
those who are so fortunate as to
take part, but the members who
from the audience would either
revtew or learn for the ﬁrst titiic
many facts that would possibly
not have come to their attention.
All those students, both young:
inert and young women, o( all tier
pattnients of the School of Music.
who are interested in such an efr
fmt are requested to meet
Tuesday next (Oct, igth) prompt
ly' at (mg in Mr. Cole’s loom, for
the purpose . of discussing the
matter, and [or organization. it
shoultl he added that the famine

tioti of such a society would in no
way interfere with the work of
the other societies, special ar-
rungemenls being made with slit
dents who belong to n regular lit-
erary society besides
