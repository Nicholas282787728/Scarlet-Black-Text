Professor John B. DeMotte.

Tile crowded house which
greeted l’iofcssor Dehlotte Satur-
day evening attcstcd the poptllai'e
ity which ire won last year in Grin»
nell. The lecture on "Python
Eggs and the American Boy"
iully sustained the speaher's repu-
tation. As ascqucl to "The Harp
of the Senses” it closely followed
the same liiles as that lecture, but
the intense personality of the loc-
turcr and lils enthusiasm in his life
study and work were as inspiring
as on the occasion oi his ﬁrst ap-
pearance, and fol trvo irours he
held his audience tairiy spell~

bound. The scientiﬁc truilis at-

tractivcly presented which I’roics-.

sol' Dchlottc brings to his hearers.
cannot but set them thinking seir
iously, and herein must lie the
secret of his popularity.
His lectures are entertaining. but
they are more than that, they are
splendidly instrrrctive.

The graphic portrayal or the

great

power oi passion and habit by thel

nrctaplioi ot the python was ex-
ti'eiliely effective, and the illustra-
tions in charge ol the expert as-
sistant, Mr, I-larrington,werc well
chosen and suggestive, while pel-
haps not so striking as some of
the illustrative experiments used
in “The I-Iarp of the Senses.”
rroiessor DeMotte spokc on
“Success Means Sacriﬁce” to an
audience which ﬁllcd every seat
ot the chapel Sunday afternoon,
The tall: was thoroughly practical
and was listened to with nnﬂag-
ging interest. The spcaltcr dwelt
on the necessary sacriﬁce of ca-
price to capacity. of leisure to la-
bor, ot dissipation of sell to dis
cipline of sell, of sham to sincere

ity, in order to achieve real suc-
Cess.

Sunday evening Profcssor Dc-
Motte spokein the Stone church
to a third crowded house. The
theme of this talk was stated thus,
“The value of a man as of a "111'
chine is measured by the product
of his wollt."

All who heard Mr. Dcll'Iottc
were thoroughly charmed by the
man and impressed by his mes-
sago and mission. We count it a
rare privilege that he should so
generously sacriﬁce his day or
rest in order tb speak to the stu-
dents and people a second and
third time. His vrsit to Gtinncll
has won him many new friends
ships and has deepened those
whicll he had already made here,

The Iowa City boys arrived
this morning on the fast mail and
have been spending the day rer
cuperating tor this evening's con-
cert. The two clrrbs together
number about torty people and
are a ﬁne looking set of fellows.
The concert promises to be in-
tensely rnterestingand should not
be missed. If the position of thc
Athleticunion does not appeal
to you. perhaps you may be
reached by the prospect of an
evening or Fine music.

 

The Honor System.
There is ,a movement on

Michigan. It is expected that a

pl'cssioll ot opinion is desirable

The meeting will probably be ans
