General Robert E. Lee, an Antl~
Secessionist.

Tire interesting address of President
Andrews in Grinnell last evening on
Robert E. Lee would hardly arouse a
typical Southerner into an ecstacy of
eulogy or a sensible (even though
sensitive) Unionist into spasms of
criticism. It was thoughtful, welle
balanced, and not at all an over»
wrought eulogy of the great leader of
the South during the Civil War. That
a man so able and so noble as Rob—
ert E. Lee was an American will al»
ways he a source of just pride north
of the Potomac as truly as south of it.
This, however, will not compel us to
forget or to cease to regret the fearful
mistake of his life, as it seems to us,
when he entered the service of Vir-
ginia and of the Confederacy against
his conviction that secession was not
a constitutional right.

Some may have forgotten what
Gen. Lee wrote to his son on Jaini-
ary 23, 186i. His words then were:

“The franrers of our Constitution
never exhausted so much labor, wis-
dom and forbearance in its formation,
and surrounded it with so many guards
and securities if it was intended to be
broken by every member of the corr-
federacy'at will. it is intended for
‘perpetual union,’ so expressed in the
preamble, and for the establishment
of a gaverrrtrrent, not a compact, which
can only be dissolved by revolution
or by the consent of all [be people in
convention assembled. it is idle to
talk of secession; anarchy would have
been established and not a govern-
ment by Washington, Hamilton, Jefr
ferson, Madison and all the other
patriots of the revolution," i. e., if
each state could secede “at will,”

Lee’s mistake here about the words
of the Constitutton does not invalir
date his argument or weaken his con
clusion. It was in the Articles of

 

Confederation that the Union was de—i
clared to be “perpetual,” and the Con-
stitution was framed to nrake that
“perpetual union” “more perfect."
If it was idle to talk of secession from
a perpetual union how much more
idle, if possible, would it be to talk of
secession from a “perpetual union”
made “more perfect!” But it was
exactly that more perfect perpetual
union out of whose service Gen. Le‘e
withdrew on April 20th, and to de—
stroy which he took command of an
army two days later.

“How could he do that?”7was the
question which I had hoped President
Andrews would answer. He did not
allude to it. It will remain a puzzle
to the future historian.

Lee did not accept the doctrine of
State Rights in January, ’61. If he
did in April how did he answer his own
arguments made in the January be»
fore? ‘

During the war he was a hero in a
bad cause, in one which he himself
had declared to be bad.

After the war he was a hero in a
good one, “first" in his section “in
peace," We will not complain if he
shall continue to be “ﬁrst in the
hearts” of many of his countrymen.

The question to be debated for the
afternoon was, Resolved that the pres
ent system of education is not suﬁir
ciently meeting the practical demands
of the age.

The afﬁrmative was opened by Miss
Kellenbarger, who spoke of an edur
cated citizenship as one of the great
est needs ot the age. The present
educational system is riot meeting
this demand as it should, for it does
not reach the masses, while those who
are reached are not ﬁtted for citizen-
ship, because of the theories as well as
the masses of facts, which do not help
him to solve practical problems.
There is a general lack of moral err-
thusiasm in students. To a great eXr
tent the system fails to develop origr
inality of thought, as is shown by the
orations and theses. Physical traiur
ing is largely overlooked.

Miss Tallman, on the negative, said
that the term “education" should be
broadened to include more than col-
leges and universities. The Chautau-
qua system is oﬁered to many unable
to attend college. Theories and facts
are needed for practical life. The

 

blame for the lack of moral enthu-
siasm does not rest so much with the
colleges as with the homes, which are
the source of all high morality. A
great many opportunities are now otr
fered for development of originality,
as well as physical strength; the fairlt
may be that of the individual rather
than of the system. Although the
educational system is not perfect, it
does to a large degree meet the pres-
ent needs.

After rebuttal of the preceding
points tirade by the negative, Miss
Fellows showed the great waste in the
transfer from grade to grade and from
one department to another, in expect—
ing the student to have studied what
he has not, as well as in teaching over
what he has previously studied. The
system should be more thoroughly
and universally organized.

In rebuttal Miss Orvis pointed out
that responsibility may always be
shifted, so the waste might be due to
the teachers more than to the system.

After discussing the points of rebut-
tal, Miss Kellenbarger summed up the
debate.

Messrs, Grier, Moller and Way
acted as judges. The decision was
given unanimously in favor of the
afﬁrmative.

Miss Smith had charge of some
tableaux representing scenes from
Shakespeare.

The TempestiMiranda lulled to
sleep by her father; Ferdinand and
Miranda playing chess.

Romeo and JulietiRomeo meet
ing Juliet; he nurse and Juliet.

Macbeth—Lady Macbeth.

[n the election of officers, Miss
Tailman was chosen president; Miss
Fellows, vicerpresident; Miss Piner‘,
secretary.
