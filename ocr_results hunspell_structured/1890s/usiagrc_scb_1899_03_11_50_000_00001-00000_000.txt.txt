Glee Club and Orchestra Concert

The ﬁfth annual concert given
by the Iowa College Glee Club
and the Amphion orchestra is
pronounced by the many auditors
assembled at the Stone Church
last evening an unqualiﬁed suc.
6655. At the home concert both
organlzations are supposed to be
in the ﬁnest condition. After
months ot arduous labor in prep.
aration, and one previous appear-
ance on the part of the Glee Club.
where it has a chance to try its
mettle, and before it has lost any
of its sparkle and vivacity in thc
rendition otits songs,by the jading
inﬂuence of the annual tour, they
lavish their best efforts on the
alum mm and the Grinnell pub-
lic. So they have grown dear to
our hearts, and the annual concert
has become by tacit consent, the
smart event of the year.

The appearance of the house
!ast cvening fully ccrrobordtesthis
statement. After a large prelim-
inary sale the students and citizens
turncd out w marry to do the
honors. The church itself was
handsomely decorated with the
scarlet and black, while the audi-
ence was made gay by the large
sprinkling of light evening gowns.
It was an enthusiastic audience
too. judging by the number of
cncores demanded. They must
have emulated the boy on the
burning deck, and kept their
“claps” up their sleths, for not a
number went by without loud and
persistent applause, and numer-
ous recalls were the order of the
evening.

The orchestra is smaller by sev-
eral pieces than last year, but the
quality of its tvorlt compared very
favorably with previous efforts,
theleby evincing clearly
than ever the extraordinary talent
of Prot. Cole ‘in organizing and
making the most of his opportune
ities. The Gloriana overture was
well rendered and was partly re.
peated in responseto thcdcmands
of the audience. From there on
the enthusiasm of both performr
ers and listeners seemed to in
crease. The serenade by Titl was
very charming, with its unusual
combination of ham and whistle,
Mr. Harris, who isalways a prime
favorite. appeared to better ad-
vantage than usual, in the more

serious music, and made his adr
mirers wish he would do more in
that style. Mr. Delavan did ex~
cellent work also. producing a
clear steady tone. The two operr
atic selections with their many
melodious air were especially ac-
ceptable, To many the second
number oi Part II was the gem of
the evening.—both the
Amaryllls, with lts quaint minuet
ettect. and Schubert's thoughtful
strains,7being charmingly
dered.

way, showed less precision and

Cole's song. “Polly," which IS al.
ways a tavorite at Ann Arbor, was
charmingly sung by Mr. Millard.
whose ﬁne baritone ivoice was
well suited to its plaintive melody.
Mr. Millard is certainly a great
acquisition to the Club. Equally
successful was Mr. Macartney
in his rendition of “Massa,” one
of the encores. His voice is rich
and sympathetic, and his enuncia-
tion clear.

Mr. Peirce and Mr. Parish ad-
ded materially to the program by
their rendition of “Schnieder.”

eling is always popular, and this
time was no exception, as shown
by the urgent demand for an our
core.

The element of fun entered
largely into the unprinted halt of
the program and also into one or
two of the regular numbers, nota-
