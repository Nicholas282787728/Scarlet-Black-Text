when the smoke of the engage-
ment had cleared away Grinnell
was discovered to have scored a
grand total of ﬁve against a zero
tor the Sirnpsonians.

Regalded as football. the game
was a very mediocre cxhrbitron,
It is true that the hard game of
last Saturday may have had some
effect on the men, and the bad
condition of the grounds was a
drawback to fast play. but these
circumstances cannot wholly ac.

hibition which was put up by the
Grinnell representatives. No one
