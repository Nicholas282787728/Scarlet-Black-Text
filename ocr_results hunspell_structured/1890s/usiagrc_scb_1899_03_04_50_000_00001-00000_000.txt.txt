Miss Edna Proctor opened the
program with a piano solo which
was heartily eneored and a second
number was very much enjoyed
by the society.

Mrs. Moody followed with an
interesting talk upon “Stage Re-
sources and the Theatre" giving a
sketch of the Greek and Roman
theatre and the development of
the modern stage, having its rise
in the contrivance on wheels upon
which the miracle plays were per-
formed though the Elizabethan
age, to the present well equipped
ﬁrerproof stage.

Miss Anna Field read an ex-
ceptionally well prepared paper
upon “Eminent Actors and Act-
tresses of the Century." The sub-
ject being so broad Miss Field
conﬁned herself to the most eniie
neni Ameiican and English actors,
speaking especially oi Mrs. std
dons, julius Brutus Booth and his
son Edwin Booth, whose pectic
liarly moody liie was very enter
tainingly reviewed. “I play Leai i"
he ivas known on one occasion to
to say. “I play Richard the III
and Hamlet, it you please, but I
am Lear."

The extemporaneous work took
the form or a debate, the question
being, “Resovled, That a Girl's
Society is the Strongest Inﬂuence
in her Life. Misses Grenage and
Styles supported the aﬁ‘irmative,
Misses Grayham and McClanalian

member of the society, Marion
Bruntlctt. The story, asits name,
The Firm-minded Four, hints, is
thatot a society ot girls, banded
together for the uplifting oi ivoinr

tion of the state of maidenhood.

In the ﬁrst scene the subject is
discussed with animation, the club
is formed. and Miss Helen Brown,
its most enthusiastic supporter, is
made president. The second
scene shows what the gentlemen
think of the new organization. es-

is extremely obnoxious, Scene

duct of President i-Ielen, who, at
the very urgent request of Jack,
lurns traitor to the cause of the
“Firmrmlnded Four." This clir
max was especially amusing and
well brought in.

Those taking part were: Misses
Meyer, Ora and Ethyl Graham,
Goldswotthy. Millerd and Julia
Miller. The parts were all very
well done, especially those taken
by Ora Graham and Helen Milr

Miss Brown favored the society
with a whistling solo. The time
between the scenes wasvci-y pleas-

by Margaret McCornack and read~

The Young Men's and Young
Women's Christian Associations
held a joint meeting Thursday
evening and listened for an hour
to Mr. Burton St. john who is
traveling secretary of the Student
Volunteer Movement.

Mr. St, John began his talk by
saying that one who is deeply in»
tercsied in any one line of Chi s
ian work cannot help but be in-
terested in all lines, so that when
he presented the cause oi roieign
nirssrons he did not feel that he
was lessening the interest that was
taken in home mi 'ons and other
branches of Christian work, but
tiiat he was increasing the interest
in these departments as well as in
foreign missions.
