give the first lecture of the Y. M.

church next Friday evening, upon
Shakespeare’s ”Merchant of Ven-
ice". Tickets will not be sold, but

INSTITUTE PROGRAM.

The attendance Saturday even-
ing was quite small owing to the
large number of members who had
gone to Des Moines. Nearly all
who were in town were present,
however. The installation of all
officers, except president and sar-
geaut-at-arms, took place ataprev-
ions meeting. These two worr-
ﬁrst installed by Chaplain hchow»
an, and then the literary program
was given. The inauguralof Pres-
ident \Vhitley was short and to the
point. It contained advice, which,
if followed, would insure the suc-
cess of the society. McConnu
read a paper on “An Ideal Room-
mate” which closed with a unique
condition of affairs. Extcmporaw
eons addresses were made by Brew~
or, Hollenbeck and Tewle on sul»
jects all touching on phases of so-
ciety work This Qrt of work is
excellent in its results. The regu-
lar debate was postponed on ac-
count of the small number present.

THE CH RESTOS.

The Chrestomathians, notwith-
standing the absence of many
members who went to Des Moines
to attend the football contest, were
fairly represented, and rendered
an unusullly strong program. F.

 

 

 

IOWA COLLEGE.

GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1894.

 

W. Johnson read a paper on the
“Mission of the Literary Society,“
in which he discussed at length the
rightful position of the literary so-
ciety, anti the reason for its failure
at the present to ﬁll that position.
Mr. Row gave a dcclamation,
“Roll on.” This was short but
well given. Mr. J. Smith's essay
on “Evolution," which was read
by Mr. Mereness, showed that the
writer had been studying the sub»
ject. In his oration on HIndivid-
uality in Education,” Mr. Wright
clearly excelled his previous efforts.
The oration well written,
though not strictly in oratorical
form, and well delivered. Mr.
Henry made his first appearance
on this program in an extclnpora-
neous review of Helen Hunt Jacka
son's Ramona. He made a favor-
able impression, and will make a
good worker. Extemporaneous
work followed. Mr. Peck spoke
upon “Music in the Literary Soci»
ety." M. S. Brown gave an ex-
ternporaneons piano solo, which
was well rendered. Mr. Blather
wick followed with a speech upon
the“Political Outlook." ' In the
debate upon tbequestion: Resolved
that trusts should be discouraged
by law, Evans supported the aflir»
mative and W'illiams and Smith
the negative. A spirited general
discussion followed. The debate
was won by the afliirmative.

A MUSICAL SOCIETY.

A musical organization has at last
bccn perfected. Last night a meet
ing was held in the lecture room of
the Congregational church, and
about 65 were present. It was Ller
cided to form a socit v for the study

 

of Uni/nub C/mrnn'r fun! Can/alto.

The officers chosen were: Mr.
S. If, llorrick, president; lt ti.
Cole, director; 3 iss Gwinnei, pian-
ist; E. B. Brande, treasurer; \V. A.
Little, secretary; Vhliss Kate IIibr
bard, librarian. A committee was
appointed to draw up the constitu-
tion and byrlaws.

At the close of the business meet-
ing, Prof. Cole very skilfully con-
ducted them through Mendelssohn's
42d I’salm, “As the Hart Pants."

The Society promises to be one
of the most successful in the histo-
ry of the college.

The management was unable to
obtain the $3.00 rate for the Min
neapolis game. It is not yet known
what reduction will be made.

press our sympathies with one of

mother, Mrs, Brewer, whom it has
seemed good to our wise and kind
Heavenly Father to call home. We
wish to assure him that the sylnpir
thetic thoughts of his classmates
are with him in his bereint-Inent.

HONORS TO OUR CONSERVATORY.

Prof. Cole is in receiptof aletter
announcing his recent election to
active membership of the New
York Manuscript society, and that
in consequence of this, some of his
compositions will be performed
there in the near future. This or-
ganization is composed of the fore-
most American composers. and is
to this country what the London
Royal Society is to England. The
entertainments given under its aus-
pices are considered among the
most select in New York. Mr.
Cole therefore has the honor of
being placed among the first Amer-
ican composers, it will no
doubt be a great gratiﬁcation to
have his works performed under

and

such favorable ausp es.
