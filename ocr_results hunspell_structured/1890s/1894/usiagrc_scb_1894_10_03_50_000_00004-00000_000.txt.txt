THE SIMPSON GAME

All are anxiouslylooking forward
to the Iootball game of next Satur-
day. If there is any time when the
home team will need the hearty
support oI their Iellow students
and the encouragement of their
presence it will be at this time
when they step forth to coin—

'pcte Ior' the laurels with the

State Championship Team of
Iowa. Their anxiety can hardly be
wondered at when we look at Simp»
son's last year's record#not a

single score against them, the total

score oI all their games standing
176 to their opponents 0. They are
again sending out a Strong team
this year with which they expect
to keep up their exceptional rec-
_ord. Their team is slightly heavi-

 

seveu touchdowns, from which

not meet on the football ﬁeld this

 
     

The attention of the students lizs‘
already been called to the payment
oI the Athletic Union dues. It is
obvious that the Union is depend—
ent upon the students Ior its sup-
port, and it is no more than fair
that only those should enjoy its
privileges who compensate such
privileges by payment of their dues
or a necessary equivalent.

It is well known that some stud-
ents cannot afford to pay these
cash dues and we are glad that an
opportunity is aIIorded for
some of these to give an
equivalent in work. Any who
desire to do this will please apply
to ]. F. Darby, manager of the
Iootl)all team.
