THERE is one department of
SCARLET AND BLACK which is very
otten open to criticism, namely,
the alumni column. Most oi the
criticism comes (rain the alumni
themselves, and is very often well
deserved.

It must be remembered, how-
ever, that the alumni editor has
no easy task. He must‘ get his
material from whatever sources
he can, and those sources are
often unreliable, so that mistakes
are bound to creep in.

Matters would be greatly sini-
pliﬁed it the alumni would take
more interest in that part of the
paper which is set aside for them,
It is one thing to criticise a mis-
take after it has been made;
other, to compile an errorless col-
umn from uncertain data. SCARV
LEI AND BLACK would request
that all alumni, both in Grinnell
and outside of the city, see that
the paper gets accurate informer
tion of their doings and where
abouts It is only through the
help of the alumni that the alum-
ni column can be made what it
ought to be.

IT HAS not yet been decided
when the fall meet will take place
but in all probability it will be
this coming > Saturday or one
week later. This fall meet Will
be the initiatory one tor a nums
ber of the men and we desire to
give them a tow words of en-
couragement. Athletes are not
made in a single year and if the
old track men are a little faster
in the sprints or are able to do a
few inches better on thc jumps
than the new men it is because
they have had more training and
experience. Many of the .old
men have had to toil {or several
seasons heroic tiicy were able to
geta place in home ﬁeld meet
and it is not expected that the

ari-

 

new men will be able to compete

successfully with them the ﬁrst
year. In this tall meet, however.
the new men will have a better
chance because of the fact that
they \\‘Ill be given libcral ltnlldl'
caps over the old track mcn. Tins
will give all an equal opportunity
to win and no one ivho is able to
getouion the track should re
[use to talte part. It is often the
case that men desire to do some
thing in athletics but have not
conﬁdence enough in themselves
to get out and try. A moderate
dcgioe of ~ellras )i‘tion is an ad
niiiable thing in some cases and
has much to do With the success
of an individual iii any line of
work. Don't be so bashful that
you are alraid to talie part in
athletics and if you are already in
training don't be discouraged with
your efforts. Faithful training
will make marked improvement
in any track man.

Italian and modern music and il-
liisti'ated by playing Arcadelt's
Ave Maria, The society then
listened to the reports of the
