or custom. Or suppose again the
case or an English gentleman
who has inherited an estate with
its income. encumbrances and
other burdens which go along
with it. Custom and family pride
requires that he should strive to
tree this estate from its encum-
brances and leave it to his heirs
in a better condition than when
he received it. Compared with
a person’s life this estate is his
Characteriwllat he inherits from
liis ancestors. The sum or the
life of the whole wolld is in each
one of us. We are full of IICI'ECl'
iiary impulse. our lives are very
largely run by the dead hand at

people haolr of us. The income ot
this estate is one's strength. There
are people who are born tired, if
they are in poor circumstances
they are called lazy, it they are
iicli they are said to be indolent.
The encumbrances on the estate
which one inherits are moral quzlr
itles which are of a low order,
such as a bad temper. It is onc’s
duty to clear off these encumr
brances and hand down a better
estate. The mortgagee is nature

 

\vho forecloses unless one does
something toward paying up."

“Considering that one has an es—
tate or income, the ﬁrst questions
ivhich naturally arise are: ‘VVllal
is it we ale? What is it we are
for?’ Although llercdlty deter
mines to sortie degree what one is,
yet one's life today is great or
small according as he hirnselt
maltcs it. To be great does not
imply great talent. A small per
son in the right place is bettei
ilian a dozen in wrong places
Expansion is a necessity to great—
ness, There is need of moral
gymnastics to develop moral qualr
ities. One of the most valuable
of these qualities is self-control.
It is selfrcontl‘ol which separates
one from a mere mass of lnlleri~
tance, education and custom One
must have the will to do. before
he can beneﬁt the human race."

Mrs. Stetson ended by giving a
teiv rules by which one can devel~
0p moral qualities. "Do a thing
as often as you think or it. Stop
before you are tiled. It takes
time to alter the structure of the
human brain and when one makes
zi resolution to attain any habit he
must not expect that he can reach
his ideal all at once. Moral growth
like physical is slow and gradually
progressive.”
