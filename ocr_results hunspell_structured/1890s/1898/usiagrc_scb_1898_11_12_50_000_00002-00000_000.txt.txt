THE TROUBLE between faculty-
and certain students which has
occupied the minds of those cons
nected with college for the past
week has at last ended, although
only after considerable feeling
had been aroused among the
students in general. While We
recognize the principle that when
property is destroyed those who
know who were the destroyers
can be held responsible, yet we
think that the president andthc
faculty have taken an exceeding»
1y unwise course this late
trouble. In the ﬁrst place the
damage to property was so slight
that the matter had far better
have been settled in some othei
way than in trying to make the
four who confessed some know-
ledge of the deed. to tell what
they knew of it. They had no
knowledge as to who was the one
who painted the sills and in the
case of the painting on the side-
walk the four suspected three dile
ferent persons as the perpertratcr
of the deed. In this case it seems
unjust to make the continuance of
the four boys in college dcpcndent
on the telling of their suspicions
regard to the matter. The
student body on the whole sup-
ported thc four boys in their
position and the faculty will have
to choose some otlicr way to es-
tablish their principles than by
taking the stand which they have
taken in this recent trouble. We
feel that a student's sense of
honor is deserving of some re»
spect an
authority and that it is not work
ing forthc good of a student to
force him continually to violate
this sense of honor, There has

in

in

been a growing lack of conﬁdence '

. on the part of the students in the

actions of the faculty and we
think that it is not wholly the
fault of the students. The meth~
odsot discipline seem to us tar
from wise in many cases and nls
though they may accomplish their
purposes in the ease in hand, they
leave an impression among the
students that they are being
torced, and keeps them from be-
open and frank with the
faculty. The recent action in re-
gai'd to chapel attendance comcs
tar irom inspiring conﬁdence in
the actions of the faculty. It
would be better that deﬁnite lules
be established than that the
students should constantly fcel
that they are tinder a detective

have been so greatly lessened, for
various purposes it is the desire of
nearly every one to go abroad

Dr. Barrows was sent out by the
University of Chicago to deliver
a course of lectures through india
and to make a special study of
the Asiatic religions. some res
Iigion must at last rule the world.
Alter studying Buddhism. Hinr
(ltllsm, and many others. he has
decided that Christianity is the
only true religion.

The greatest empire of the
world is neither Germany nor any
other nation. but the empire of
human kindness. The three great
evangalizcrs ot‘ Asia today are;
truth, love and kindness. The
most beautiful sight one can see
is to visit some lowly Christian
mccting in India, The lecture
closed with a ﬁtting and patriotic
reference to the recent achieve
rnents of the nation and with
words or praise for our national
