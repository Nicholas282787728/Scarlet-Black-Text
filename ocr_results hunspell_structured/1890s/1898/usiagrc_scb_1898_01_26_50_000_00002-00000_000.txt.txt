Those who have had opportunity
to hear Dr. Taylor understand
what it tneans to have him tvith us
at this time. Probably no man
now writing and speaking on the
questions at soctological and po-
litical import is more gladly lienid
by western audiences. although he
is not so very tridely known as a
public speaker. ‘ l-lis message to
us at this time is particularly of
impoitaitce from the ieligious
point of View. but even aside irom
this, he is a man whom no one of
the studrnts should fail to heat.

THE MID YEAR examinations
close to-morrow, and the neck
toward which the students or all
classes have looked ioiward with
varied feelings will soon be passed
The recurrence of this period
raises again the question of tile
advisability of trying to deter-
mine a student’s teal standing in
so artiﬁcial and uns.—tisiactoiy a
nianner'. We do not believe in
the examination system as now
conducted. We do not believe it
gives in gen all a fair test oia

case that the hardest examina»

the ireshman year. The students
