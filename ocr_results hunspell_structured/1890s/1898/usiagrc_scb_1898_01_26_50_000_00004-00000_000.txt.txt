The Revision of the Football
Rules.

Followtng the example of the
western universities, the east
about to act in regard to the to

is

vision ni ihe toothtill rules, so as)

to remove all possibility ot rational
public criticism or the game.

C. Q Cttyler, Princeton '79,
President of the University Club,
has issued a formal call to the
"Big Five" for a meeting of theii
representatives on 21 Rules Comr
mittee It is probable that the
same men will be called upon to
serve as representatives, who have
composed the Rules Committee
during the last tivo meetings:
Messrs. Vl’alter Camp, Yale; Alex-
ander Moftatt, Princeton; John C.
Bell, Pennsylvania; Joseph H.
Sears. Haivard; Li M. Dennis,
Cornell; Paul Dashiel, a graduate
of Lehigh, now instructor in the
United States Naval Academy at
Annapolis, delegate at large.

Nothing deﬁnite can be pre—
dicted of the action of this come
mittec; but the probabilities are
that the moie important changes
ivill be, the abolishing of mass-
plnys by making seven men re-
main in the line until after the
hall is snapped, and also oi the
rule that the quarterback is not
allowed to run with the ball until
it has been passed to some other
player, The general object will
be to make the game more open.

The Wisconsin Cardinal says
editorially, in regard to the new
football rules: “It is not likely
that Wisconsin ivill take cognir;

 

ance of the football rules as laid
out by Stagg and Everett, except
in so tar as they agree \\'Ilh the
results of the eastern conference
which will be held in New Volk
on February i2, As we predicted,
the attempt on the part ul Chicago
to establish in the west. iules diir
ferent from those in the east, has
failed. While there are some
good points in the new rules, the
revision as a whole is incompetent
and will not prove acceptable to
most western colleges. Norlhr
western has already expressed
her disapproval ot the revision,
while the antagonism of Wisconr
sin and Michigan to any strictly
western rules, well-known.
Without the support of these three
important institutions the rules
will never go into ehtect. Wis
consin maintains that there is no
necd of separate rules tor [lie west,
and will wait for and abide by the
eastern titles."
