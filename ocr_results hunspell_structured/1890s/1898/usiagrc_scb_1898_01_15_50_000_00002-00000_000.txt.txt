THEWlNTER term has uow fairly
begun and with tiie change of
season cotnes also a change in the
object of interest to the student.
The molesltins are now laid aside.
and we no longer appeal tor bet
ter support for the football teams.
This time it is toward the socier
ties that ive urge attention. Nolll-v
ing reed be said about the value
ottlris training; that is well known
and admitted even by those who
do not attend. Most conscienr
tious ivoik is done by the few who
frequent the society halls on Sat»
urday evenings; to them nothing
but praise. But tiiose who never
attend society at all we cannot
commend so heartily. To them is
due the blame tor our poor Show
ing in oratory. and not to athletics
nor to the faitlilul few on whom it
is usually laid. In an institution
the size of ours the cooperation
ot all is required. in every ﬁeld of
competition in which we enter. in
order to meet success. Think of
this and then look over the roll of
the men's societies—not oneriliird
of the men in the institution are
members. In the nomen's socler
ties a very different condition is
found; the attendanceislarge,tlie
productions as a rule show careiul
preparation, and the whole pro-
gram draws closest attention. If
in the past society work had
roused enthusiasm equal to that
displayed in athletics. our position
in the oratorical contests would
not have shown such :tcontrast to
the places we have held in other
departments. and would not have
exposed us to the raise charge oi
"running entirely to athletics."

A new building for the law der
