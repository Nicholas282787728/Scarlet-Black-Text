The lnstitute-Chresto nebato. ‘

The ﬁrst or the series or Jolntl

debates which has recently been
inaugurated by the Clll'estt)ll1ntlli»l

an Society and Grinnell institutc.‘
was held lust Saturday evening in
Chresto hall. it this debate is tol
be taken as a criterion of rhosc‘
which are to follow. this new cic-
partrn-e may well be considered a
step forward in the society work

or the college.

Tire meeting was thrown open
to all the studcnts and the hall
was well ﬁlled. As hosts of the
occasion,the Chrestomathranshad
prepared a program of more titan
usual merit. The ﬁrst number
was a whistling solo by Miss
Brown, uhich was cordially en-
cored. Following this, the audi-
ence was entertained by a humor-
ous sketch entitled “Sonic Village
Cronics. adapted from Hamlin
quland's “Sketches of \Ncster'n
Life." The farce itself was inter-
esting and amusing and lost none
or its effectiveness by the manner
in which it was handled. Owen.

was upheld by Parker and Mailer
of the Chrcstomatlrian Society,
while Roberts and Swan ot the
Institute supported the negative.
Both sides showed the most carer
rul anti thorough prcparation,and
the debate was closely fought
throughout. Parker, tor the air
ﬁtmdtivc. made an excellent
speech in opening the debate. and
was also strong on rebuttal, but
his colleague was not at ease on
the floor and did not present his
arguments so clearly.

Roberts and Swan both had exs

ccllcnt delivery and presented
their arguments in an effective
manner.

riot. Johnson, who acted as
chairman or the evening, summed
up the arguments on both sides
and gave his decision in terror or
the negative.

The next debut: at the series
will beheld in Institute hall, Dec.
17. It is to be hoped that it will
arouse as much interest and be as
successfully conducted as this ﬁrst
one. since these debates between
the two societies ought to become

"an established custom.
