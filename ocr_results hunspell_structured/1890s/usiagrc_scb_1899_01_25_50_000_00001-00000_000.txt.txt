K
GrInnell Institute.

The society was called to order
by President Davis, with a con»
spicuous number of members abs
sent. This was the more unforttle
nate because ot the especially
good program which had been
prepared. “Current Events" by
Crandall was concise and yet exp
haustive. Mr. Norris followed
with aninterestingtalk on“]apan”.
“The Nicaraguan Canal Project as
it Appears Today," was the sub-
ject of a timely article by Swan,
A reading by Mr. Delavan, “The
Intervention of Pete,” from Paul
Lawrence Dunbar, was delivered
in a way which showed that the
reader was interested in his selecr
tion. The extemporaneousivork
oi the evening, by Macartney and
Campbell, was the best feature of
the evening, and showed the rapid
strides which Grinnell Institute is
making in this important depart-
ment of society work. An instru-
mental solo by Miss Millerd was
greatly enjoyed by the society,
Miss Millerd kindly responded to
a hearty encore.

The subject for debate was, “Re-
solved, that thc dispensary sys»
tem is the best solution of the Ii»
quor question.” Stevens and Sui»
der supported the amrmative, and
Frisbie and Parish the negative.
The afﬁrmative, while putting tip
a fair debate, could havcd one
manifestly better it they had pre~
pared more conscientiously. The
decision was given in favor of the
negative.

After the debate. two old mem
bers of Grinnell Institute, Mr.
Shadbolt and Mr. Towle, with
words of encouragement inspired
the society to new energy and la-
bor. Mr. Towle's reminiscences
of the Grinnell Institute of the
past were especially interesting.

ary work. Not only were most of

proper time, but a numbcr of VISIs
tors favored the society with their
presence. Mr. Velin read a paper
on the “Dictionary." While this
subject might seem rather unills
viting. Mr. Velin's paper was both
entertaining and instructive. Miss
Bousquet favored the society with
a vocal solo, in her usual pleasing
manner, and kindly responded to
an encore.

Mr. Cruikshank-’5 reading was
well rendered, and entertaining,
although alittlc too long for such
an occasion.

The most interesting number ot
the evening was Mr. Leonard's
study of Ibsen's drama, "The Err»
emyo‘therl’l‘nple.” In this drama
is presented a spectacle which
might well occur in any modern
city. the spectacle of a public-
spirited citizen standing alone in
his ﬁght for the higher welfare of
the community, The second mus
sical number was a piano solo. by
Miss Thompson.

The question for debate was:

cision wasin favor of the negative,

One of the most helpful num~
bersofevery program IS the report

report Saturday evening was no
exception, although in the general

gentlemen proceeded to criticrse

Chapel Addresses by Mr. Ralph
waldo Trine, of Boston.

Tire students of Iowa College
will have a privilege of great spir-
itual Value in the two addresses
to be given next Sunday in the
college chapel by Mr. Ralph Wale
do Trixie, of Boston. Tile after-
noon address, which will come at
3:30. will have for its subject,
“Conditioning Circumstances In-
stead of Being Conditioned by
Them." The vesper address,
which will be given at 6:00 o’clock,
the usual houroftheSunday evens
ing chapel services. will be upon
“The Element of True Success,”

Mr. Trine has become widely
known in England and America,
as one of the most helpful and
comprehensive writers upon
themes of the “inner life” in their
relations to practical problems,
both individual and social. His
books upon these themesJIn
Tune With the Infinite,” ”What
All the World's A-Seeking,” “The
Greatest‘rhing Ever Known." etc.
——have had an extraordinary read-
ing and inﬂuence. and have pop-
ularly ranked l\’Ir. Trine with Prof.
Henry Drummond in the literary
and human treatment of the spir-
itual lite. He represents the ﬁn-
cst type of spiritual culture, and is
an example ot the scholar who
has taken to the interpretation of
spiritual ideals as his life-work.

Mr. Trine is a Johns Hopkins
man, and was afterwards connects
ed wrth sociological work under
Professor Ely. But his study of
the philosophy of Fichte, and the
influence of Thoreau and Emer—
son and Whitman, besides the
natural temperament of the mys-
ticI led him away from the direct
pursuit of social science to the
problems of the individual soul in
its relation to the universal whole,
