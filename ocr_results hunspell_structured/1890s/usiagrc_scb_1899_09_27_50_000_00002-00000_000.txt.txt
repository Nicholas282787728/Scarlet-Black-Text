No Coin. paper can hold thel
place which it ought to occupy in
tile college \\'0Ild without the car-
nest and hearty support of the
student body. it is th, blect

students of Iowa Cullcgc for their
Considel'allon. By support we do
not mean merely linaiicinl aid, but
a Willingness to do acturrl ivoilt
For several yearsrt has been rather-
a difﬁcult matter to ﬁnd men l\'lllr
ing to assume part of the respon-
slbility and labor connected with
the management of a college pn-
per. Vacanctes on a board oi cd»
itors have usually been ﬁlled by
personal solicitation, rather- than
by choice, lrcm among a number
oi candidates, and otrcri it has
rcquiled considet'dble search be
fore anyone has new loulld who
was ready, and, at the same time,
qualiﬁed, to perform til: duties at
such an ofﬁce. the only reii ii
whlch can be assigned tor this in.
difference is the fact that the slur
dents do not appreciate the tact
that the college ileuspaper is real
ly an irnporttrnt department til the
college. It is true that it may notl
reach any great height of journal-
istic excellence, but, for all that, it
is the only means by which the
outside world, our neighbor insti-
tutions. and, more especially, our
alumni, can get any rnsrvrht inlii
our college in and lenin ati
are accomplishing. For tlii ions.
on. if for no other, there is need
tltat we put iorth increased cllor '
to raise the standard of excellence
in our publications We have
never yet come up to mix po
billties and we never will until we
secure a competition tor vacant
places on the editorial boards
which shall bring out the very
best material in the college. Just
now, there is too much apathy
among the great mass of the stu»
dents, and a feeling that a paper
will run itself this year and in
years to come without any a .
ance on their part. It is high
time that we take the matter a
little more seriously. and get on a
better basis for effective work.
There are now vacancies on the
staff of SCARLET 8: BLACK which
ought to be ﬁlled in the near file
ture, and there is especial need of
men from the junior and soplio.
more classes The management
will see to it that every applicant
is given a fair trial and an oppor.
tunity to show his worth. We
have tried to show forth the line
portance of work on the paper,
passing over the attendant zttlvatl~
rages. which are many, because we
feel the necessity of arousing a
greater tooling ot responsibility
among those in whose hands the
management must be lrzit next
year. We earnestly hope that
many will think over this matter
and lend their efforts toward male
ing SCARLET & BLACK a more
truly representative college paper
in the future than it has been in
the past.

Wollt, is the annual lecture course
under the auspices of the Y M
C. A. in past years these enter--
tainments have been the most pops
ulai events of the season. This
year the course is stronger than
ever before,ztn<l is entered at prlccs
within the reach ol all. Attention
is called to the [act that there is
not a weal; number tn the course.

Protessci F E. Baltlaldlol'Cli»
cngo University. director of the
t es Observatory. will give an
Illustrated leclure on some astro-
nomical subject. Professor
iiaid comes highly recommended
as lecturer by those who have
heard him. and we may expect a
rare combination of entertainment
and instruction.

l< Governor Altgeld needs no
introduction. Everyone will eni-
brace the opportunity of hearing
a man of his ability and natlollal
icputaiion. ML Altgcld spends
little time on the lecture platform,
and we are fortunate in having se-
cured Ills services.

Perhaps no lecturer bciore the
public today ismorc popular than
F. l'lopktnson Smith, Mr, Smlth
may be truly called an artist. hav-
ing gained distinction in both the
practical and ﬁne arts. Besides
being a successiul civil engineer,
he has won an enviable reputation
as a painter. author and reader.

The mcrc announcement of Ed-
ward Everett l—lale is enough to
insure a crowded house at his lec-
ture. We admire Mr. Hale for
what he is, and for what he has
been in the history of our country.
As one student expressed it, “I
would give the price ot admission
just to see him.“ But besides we
may also be certain or an address
well worth hearing.

Besides the lectures. two high
grade co'ncerts have been provrdr
ELL—The Redpath Grand Concert
Company and the Max Bendix
Company. Thlollghﬂtypogrupllr
ical error, the Redpath number has
been announced in the Slztde'nts'
Handbag/e as a Grand Opera Com-
pally, which is misleading. It is
lllCI'clyacollcel‘lcompany, Those
who heard Max Bendix last year
will be pleased to hear that he has
been secured again. He will be
supported this year by Fred. Carr
berry,tcnor; EDeSellem,contral-
to, and Emily Parsons, pianist.

Dates for some of the numbers
have not yet been deﬁnitely set-
tled; but this \till soon be arranged
and course tickets will be placed
on sale in the near future.
