success of the learn has inspired

be satisﬁed With nothing short of
the best in their power, hlr.
Watson's training methods are
somewhat ot a revelation to
Grinnell athletes, but that they
are entirely practical and reason
able lsshown beyond contradic-
tion by Mr. w tson's own suc-
cessful record. The advantages
o'thavinga practiced and active
athlete as coach are plainly ap-
parent to those who have watched
the work and ptoglcss of the men
under his charge,

THE MUSICAL ORGANIZATIONS‘

The Second Annual Trip a Con-
tinuous and Dccidcd
Success.

The glcc club and orchestra re-
turned li-oui their second annual
trip yesterday mottllng. While a

Grinncll, its lallguor, il press come

The Hip, wlrrch was c ~ily tllc
longest ever made in this state by
any college musical organization,
was remarkably srrcecsslul. Mtr
srcally, socially and ﬁnancially the
troupe made a record oi which it
may well be proud. From ﬁrst to
last the programs were rendered
with marked ﬁdelity to artistic
standard, “hilt: all seemed imbued

erously applauded, while now and
then a company of chrvalrous Nor—
mahtes would jump up and give
vent to the “Boom Ta Ray.” The
program was tollowed by a recep-
tion iii the main building which
was necessarily short but none the
less appreciated.

At Waverly the opera house
was well ﬁlled. and but for rain
would doubtless have been crowd-

the troupe entertained
