In Memoriam.

Elizabeth Earle was born
Brunswick. Mc. Aug. 28. r833,
and died in Grinnell on the 7th
inst. bearingthe name or Mrs. G.
F. Magoirn. She graduated at
Mt. Holyoke rn [860, and spent
ten years in teaching there. and
in the University ot \Visconsin.
She came to Grinuell in 1870 as
the wife of the President of the
College. She could not be induc-
ed to engage in ofﬁcial service in
the college except for a short
time, in l883e4. in an emergency.
and as acting Lady Principal aftr
er the resignation of Miss Mary
Ellis.

Her variety oi knowledge, vigor
ot tlior]ghi.grace and power or
speech, and active nature made
her conspicuous in all circles and
imposed upon her the responsi-
bilities of leadership. It was nat-
ural that she should organize the
"Busy Woman’s Club” {or litera~
ry and social improvement. and
just as natural (or its appreciative
members to change its name to
the "Elizabeth Kalle Magoun
Clu " as soon as she became too
ill to lead it longer. Her Sunday
Bible Class was always very large
because so inspiring. Her place
was so hard to ﬁll even after her

When the Iowa Branch of the W.
B, M, l. was organized in [S76 as
an auxiliary to the American
Board tor foreign missions. she
was made its President and then
retained as its “Honorary Presir
dent" when she became unable to
meet with it.

Her human and humane sympar
thres were a living fountain. a per
ennial spring. This was illustrat-
ed near her last day in one of the
moments of complete and
mat kablc selfreonsciousness which
then came to her as oases in a
desert. A sum of money had
come to her for which she had no
immediate need. “What shall ‘be
done with it?” she asked.
“Send it to the Armenians." was
her quick response,

creet guidance as a teacher werc

Few ever enjoy such cnnohling

Calocagathian Open Meeting.

The large audience at the chap
el Friday evening testiﬁed by
their presence the merits of the
Calocagathran open meetings,

The Maclaren program was no
exception to the rule. and While
not so showy as some preceding
programs, it was more truly repre-
sentativeoftlrework ottht society.

Gertrude Norris presided. and.
after a few words of welcome. an-
nounced the ﬁrst number, a paper
by Faith Douglass. on "Maclaren
asaStory Writer." MissDouglass
declared Dr, Watson a story writ-
er rather than a novelist. since he
has slight knowledge ol the tech
nicalities of plot. The clerical
type is the strongest in his works.
\vllilc Dr. Maclure and Drumr
shengh are probably the iavorites
The signiﬁcance of the bricr bush
to the Scotch people was spoken
of. Miss Douglass paper was an
admirable production. and well
delivered.slrowrng anapprecrative
knowledge of the Scotch writer,

The ﬁrst vocal'number, a ballad,

i

re-

was

 

"Myhame i. where the heather
blooms." with music by Reginald
de Koven. was given by Miss
Case. The air was particularly
suited to Miss Case's sweet voice
and the number was received with
hearty applause.

Lily Parker read a strong paper
on “Maclnren‘s Views of Life,"
showing that the moral teachings
oi Maclaren are always helptul
and wholesome. His work is
classiﬁed as intelligent idealism.
The author turns from doctrineto
life and shows strong social sym~
pathy and zeal for social service.

Maclaren’s masterpiece and fa»
volite production. “His Mother's
Sermon." was recited by Addie
Gates. who overcame the dlfﬁculr
ties of the Scotch dialect surprise
ingly well. and gave the selection
in a simple. easy manner.‘

The llest number on the pro~
gram was ,Grace Parson's recitar
tion. Drui-nshetrgh's Love Story."
from Auld Lang Sync Miss Par.
son's spoke with animation and
was especially strong in dialect.
She told well the story of Drum-
sheugh and the cause ot his “near
ncss.” The pathos ot the story
was rendered effectively.

Miss Mack delighted the audir
ence with the ever charming
“Rnhln Adair."

The second part ot the program
consisted of from Kate
Carnegie with musical accompanir
ment ot Scotch melodies. The
scenes given were:

Carmichael surprised.

The Carnegies at home.

The new housekeeper, Sarah. in
possession ot' the manse.

Carmichael’s ﬁrst call
lodge.

Barbara unpackrng the absent
minded “Rabbi’s” bag.

The drnner party at Dr. David-
son s.

Marget Howe returning from

the sacrament.
”Because i love you.”

These scenes veritable
glimpses or Scotland and were

well given. Probably the ﬁfth
and sixth were most enjoyed.
while Miss Knox and Messrs. Ly-
man and Armstrong carried ort
the honors.

The dainty evening gowns oi
the speakers gave a pleasing et-
feet,

The stage decorations were very
tasteful. the curtain drapery at
the rear being truly artistic.
