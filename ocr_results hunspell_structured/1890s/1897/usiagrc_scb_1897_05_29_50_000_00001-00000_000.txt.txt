IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL.

The day was all that could have
been asked. The third mile track
at the Y. M. C. A. athletic grounds
was in excellent condition. It is
estimated that fully 3.000 \vimcsr
sort the events and a happier. jnlr
lier crowd would be hard to ﬁnd
after many days oisearching.

There can be no question now,
but that the meet will he pclma'
nentty located in Des Moiltes.
There was a total absence of that
ctottlding on the track that has
so greatly mar-red toimer- meets.

But then the great thing is that
our doughty athletes won the cup
and won handily. Our nearest
competitor. . U. I.. was 3t points
behind tis. with Drake next with
21. AmES 11.‘ I. S. C. S. U, I. U. 2.

‘The 270 students who accom-
panied the tear-n to the meet
cheered the men on to victory in
right royal style. and they showed
the other schools from whence
part of the inspiration of our ath-
letes comes.

We wish to remark right here
that Grinncll has never sent out
a better trained athletic team than
the one which contested yester-
day. Every man had his full
strength for. the race and the cori-
(lrtion in which our men ﬁnished
hears ample proot ot the excels
lenee of Trainer Watson's ability.

No small part ot the success ot
Grinnell this year is due to his
eHorts. Mr. Watson
who has a remarkable ability to
handle athletes successfully. All
honor to Trainer Watson.

All told. it was a_ eat day lor-
us. Armstrong iotveled the state
record in the 120-yarr1 hurdles to
16 3-5 seconds. Both Hoth and
Spatlldlttg fell at the beginning or
the race. leaving the contest to he
[ought out betwccn Howells M S.
U. I. and Armstrong oi Grinncll.
Armstrong easily led his closest
competitor and ﬁnished strong in
16 3-5 seconds.

One of the prettiest races of the
day was the mile walk, Williams.
S. U. I. BI'UIICT. D. U.. and Marsh.

quarlcrrpoic was reached. when
Britncr and Marsh pulled away
