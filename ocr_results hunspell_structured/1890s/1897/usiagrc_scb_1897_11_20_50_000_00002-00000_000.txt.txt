The Passion Play.

The Y, M. C. A. lectrrre course was
very propitiously opened last evening
by Rev. J. J. Lewis’ representation of
the Pas on Play of Oberammergau,
Mr. Lewis was present at the last pro-
duction of this modern miracle play
and is fully competent to give an in
structive and impressive treatment ot
the subject.

After a series at views ot’ American
scenery, itr tlrerrrselves hardly relevant
to the subject, he led his audrence. with
a number of typical scenes on the
way, to the vrllage where in 1653
through tear of tire plague the vow
was made which has given to the
world this wonderful “object lesson in
Christianity.”

A remarkable genius of selection is
shown by these simple peasants itr the
choice of characters. Each actor rer
sembles quite noticeably the one whom
he represents and, even more, they
acquire a closer likeness through Irving
their parts. The point was made
however that this does not apply to
the three evil persons represented.

This event as it becomes more gen»
erally known attracts thousands of
visitors trom all latrds Even now
the villagers are hastening the preparar
tiOn for 1900. Six hundred and ﬁfty
people take part in the presentation
and even the most rnsigrriﬁcant part
is an object of ambition to the inhab-
itarrts, While only a small percent
of the spectators understand the lair»
guage of the actors yet so strong is
the feeling and emotion shown that it
must be understood by all. “One bles~
set‘l touch or rrrotlrer love makes the
whole world kin.”

While the speaker’s manner was not
so inrpressrve as would be expected
from the nature of the subject, hrs
dissolving views were very well chos-
en and will leave a lasting impression
of these simple peasant folk.

A vocal solo rendered in French by

beantrtnl cathedrals ot Durham, Lin-
coln and York, and the William Mor-

spoken ml. The lateness ot the hour
prevented a detarled account of the
visit to London. The hour was a
very enjoyable one, atrd the girls of
Calocagathia will be glad to welcome
Mrs. Gates again.
