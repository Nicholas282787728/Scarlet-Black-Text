Women's Gymnaslum Assuredr

Through the generosity ol Miss
Carrie Rand, the women’sgymnar
‘sitrm which has been planned tor
some time, will be built the com-
ing season. A considerable sum
had already been raised for this
purpose. but not enough had been
pletlaed to assure the building,
and Miss Rand vnluntarrlypledgcs
the entire sum necessary, stipular
ting only that she be permitted
to name the building “The E. D,
Rand Gymnasium.” as a memorial
to her father and brother, who
bore the same name.

The plans will undoubtedly fol-
low those drawn up three years
ago by Mr. H. K. Holsman ‘91,
of Chicago. This design calls tor
a burlding one hundred by forty-
eight feet. The ﬁrst ﬂoor will
contain Miss Rand's orﬁces, gym—
nasium forty-seven by seventy—
sixgteet, ample diessing rooms
with lockers, and bath rooms.
The second ﬂoor has a gallely
and running track. twenlyeseven
laps to the mile, and is also ﬁtted
up with dressing rooms and
lockers.

The location chosen is that in
the clump of trees north of
Alumni Hall. Work will be com-
menced as soon as possible and it
is expected tllat the building will
be completed ready (or occupancy
by next October,

The building will ﬁll a long felt
want, and as designed. will be a
decided ornament to the campus.
It is to be hoped that other
friends of the college will emulate
Miss Rand’s splendid service. and
that the coming semircentennial
will witness many other signs of
Grinnell's growth and prosperity,

The Concert at Montezuma.

A large audience greeted the
Glee Club and Orchcstra at Mon-
tezuma last evening and demon-
strated that a hearty welcome ale
ways awaits these organizations
in Montezuma.

The program was the same as
the one rendered at Blititklyli ex-
cepting a change in the order of
two orchestra numbers. "Marchc
Militaire" and “La Paloma.”

The work of the orchestra was
very ﬁne and the audience was
enthusiastic in their praise. The
Fest Overture proved the most
popular number and was repeated
in response to the call for an our
core. The work oi the Club was
pronounced better than at last
year's concert and it was tully ap-
prcciated.

With the organizations in the

shape they are now, and with two
weeks yet tor rehearsals,the home
concert promises to be one of the
best that will be given this sea-
son and greatly superior to the
concert last season.

The Iowa Central furnished a
special train for thistrip. leaving
Grinnellat 6 and returning imr
mediately alter the concert.

Calocagathla.

The roll call ot Calocagathia
was answered by the names of
American bookmen. Ethel Mc-
Ewen sketched the lire of Edgar
Allen Poe, one ot the earliest oi
our ﬁction writers, clearly setting
forth the dinerent phases ot his
career and the great blight in-
temperance cast over his lite.

 

 

Mabel Frisbie read a very in-
teresting paper on Washington
Irving. reviewing the career or
this brilliant man ofletters, whose
works rank so high in American
literature.

lane Fulton treated of “Kipling
as a Poet" and the paper \Va\
doubly interesting because he was
the least known to us of the three
writers,

The extemporaneous work was
unusually well given. Lillian
Wheeler speaking or the Congres~
sional Library. Sophia Martin on
Dr. Nansen and Dora Spencer on
Washington's Birthday. The
solos by Mrs. Viitum and Nellie
Clarke were very heartily enjoyed
by the society. '

S. U. I. Muslcal Clubs

The seat sale for the conceit of
the S. U. I. Glee and Mandolin
Clubs opened this morning. The
concert will be a decided treat and
the clubs should on intrinsic merit
draw a good house. The mando-
lin ‘club is called exceptionally
ﬁne, their leader, Mr. Graham,
having lead the Stanford Univer»
sity club a year or two since.
Moreover, the fact that the cone
cert is to be an Athletic Union
beneﬁt should appeal to the loy-
alty of the students, and should
insure the presence of those who
might not otherwise attend. This
wrll give a splendid opportunity
to compare the University reprEr
sentatives with our now, in this
department which is becoming so
prominent in the college world.
