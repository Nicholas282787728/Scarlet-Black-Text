Professor Matthews’ Letter.
New LONDON, Conn,
July 17th. 1897.
DEAR thtTcohiB:

Your note of July 10 has
just been forwarded to me here.
where I am for another week.

Yes, I received "On a Western
Canrpus;" and although it came
when I was in the throes of move
ing, I managed to run through it
hastily and to get a fair idea of its
contents. It interested me very
much; I thought it had more
freshness than most books of col—
lege stories. It seemed that sev-
eral oi the writers were looking at
life out of their otvn eyesiand.
as you know. that is always the
main thing in all ﬁction. * *

Yours truly,

BRANDER MATTl-trztvs.

Caiocagathia.

The program of the Caloca-
gathian Society Friday aitcrnoon
was short but very impressive.
The new oﬁicersfMiss Whitman,
president; Miss Knox, vice-presi-
dent, Miss Noel, secretary‘were
sworn in by the retiring president,
MissPatten. MissWhitmangavc
a short and inspiring inaugural
address that ought to enthuse the
members to the best of which they
are capable.

Miss Kate Bray sang two beaur
tiiul solos, greatly appreciated by
Calocagathia, after which the bus
incss meeting was held.

Miss iowa Benson, the newly

ural address. She spoke bricﬁy
of the work of the society for the

lowingoutline; 1. Early London.
11. Growth anddcvelopment, 111.

sonages. V, Famous buildings
and localities. VI. Charitable
Institutions. VII. Historical See
rial.

Miss McClanahan recited a bit
of dialect verse and Miss Pearl
Tyer gave a talk, in the line ot
the term's work, on “Early LOH'
don and the Romans."

A series of tableaux illustrating
various interesting historical
events in early English history
were presented under the direc-
tion of Miss Florence'Fonda.

The last number on the pro-
gram was an instrumental solo by
Miss Addie Gates.

The program was inall respects
good and gave promise of a suc
cessful year for the society,

Use of the Library

Perhaps it would be well, at the
opening of the college year. to
say something in regard to the
use of the library and reading
room.

The library contains 23,500
books. The reading room con-
tains 60 current publications. All
college and academy students
havc free access to the reading
room and to the shelves of the li»
brary. and are expected to use
the books and periodicals for ref»
erence.

Books and papersmay be taken
from the building by ﬁlling out a
requisition blank for each book or
paper taken. Requisition blanks
may be obtained at the librarian's
desk.

No book can be kept longcr
than two weeks. but may be re
newed at the expiration of that
time. A periodical cannot be
taken from the reading room dure
ing ofﬁce hours, which are trom
9:00 A. it. to 12:15 P. M., and from
1:30 r. M. to 5:00 r. M. On Sature
clays the library closes at 4:00 P. M.
All periodicals must be in their
respective places in the reading
room during ofﬁce hotlrs. The li-
brary is not opcn_Sundzty and

 

therefore papers or magazin
may be obtained Saturday and re
turned Monday morning.

The hooks of the library are
catalogued according to the Dew-
ey decimal system. Mr. Stlpp,
the librarian, will be glad to iurs
nish any intormation concerning
the use of the catalogue. and to
assist in ﬁnding the books desired.

IIa book is inisttsed or dam»
aged it must be paid for.

It is to be hoped that the stu-
dents will appreciatethe greatop-
portunity offered in a free access
to the library, and that they will
make good use of this vast fund
of information.

Mr. Sayford‘s Talk To-nlght,

It may, perhaps, be unnecessary
to call the attention of the stu-
dents to the talk by Mr. Sayford,
in the college chapel, at 7:30 to
night.

Pres. Seerlcy, of the State Nor-
mal School, writes of Mr. say-
ford's stay in Cedar Falls: “He
seems to have awakened much in-
terest and his meetings have been
well attended. I consider him a
man of powcr in his line ot work.
and his talks are certainly very
beneﬁcial. I cannot do otherwise
than commend him to you asl
have seen his work.”

The work of Mr. Sayford in
Cornell has also been good. we
are sure that no thoughtful stUr
dent will be willing to miss an op
porturiity of hearing this man.
who is making a life work of help-
ing students to see their position
and responsibility in every line of
work in the world today,

Resolutions of Respect.

Whereas it has pleased God in
His inﬁnite wisdom to remove
from our midst our beloved class-
mate. William Clark,

Whereas hc was a faithful and
efﬁcient member of his class and
won the respect otallby his per.
sonal integrity, winning disposir
tion and manly character.

Therefore be it resolved by the
Class of 190] of Iowa College,
that we extend our sincere and
heartfelt sympathy to the sorrow-
ing mother in her recent bereave-
ment,
