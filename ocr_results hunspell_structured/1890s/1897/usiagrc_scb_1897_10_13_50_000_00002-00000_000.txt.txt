ALTHOUGH N0 deﬁnite action
has yet been taken by the Board
of Trustees or the Athletic Union
in regard to the acceptance of the
name Ward Field, chosen by the
class 0(1893forthe AthleticPark,
the matter may be considered vir-
tually settled. No one will wish
to question the right of the class
of1893 to name the ﬁeld since
without the '93 (and there would
be no ﬁeld to name. Surely the
ﬁeld itselt could not be more high-
ly honored then by bearing the
name of Herbert C. Ward, ’gli
We wish editorally to express our
hearty acceptance of the name
and in doing so we feel sure we
represent the sentiment of the en-
tire college.

number of Volume II, of The
Unit will appear in about one
week, While the magazine needs
no introduction to the students
and friends of the college, we
must again utter the same com-
plaint and make the same appeal
that is heard so often from the:
editorial columns of undergradu-
ate papers. T/z: Unit last year
was a ventureI an experiment, and
it has not yet emerged trom this
state. The nine numbers form-
ing the ﬁrst volume do “mark the
beginning of a new era in the his
tory of literary work in Grinnell,"
and if the ideals of the editors
were not fully realized the blame
lies not wholly, not even in great
part upon them. You, the alumni
and undergraduates who read
this must know where the blame
and the responsibility lies You

. must know how impossible it is
for any one small body of students
with little time and less knowl-
edge and experience to set and
keep by their own unaided efforts
the standard of a monthly literary
magazine as high as it should be
