THAT GnlmlsLL students should
have the privilege or hearing Dr.
Gladden in the series of lectures
now in progress is a matter for
great congratulation on their part,

but the serious ﬁnancial embarzissr
merit of our oivn Athletic Associ-
ation suggests a more potent rea-
son. The thought is sufﬁciently
clear to need no further exposi-
tion, We should not be distanced
by our chief competitor in this
respect.
