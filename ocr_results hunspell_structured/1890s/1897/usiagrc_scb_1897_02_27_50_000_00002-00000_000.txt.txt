THE STUDENTS and townspeople
should not overlook their indebt—
edness to Mrs. Rand for tile ex-
ceptional advantages oitered them
through the Rand lectureship.
While they are still congratulating
themselves. and considering the
questions whicll Dr. Gladden
opened up in his recent series ot
lectures, a good opportunityﬁs ol-
fered to express to the one who en-
dowed the lectureship. the appre-
ciation and gratitude of those who
have been favored. It is a rare
privilege to have a public serics
ot lectures by a man ct national
reputation. one who has been
heard in similar courses in the
large eastern universities and sem-
inaries, and the expense or iur.
nishing such a course to the pub-
lic, absolutely tree, is by means in-
considerable, The appreciation
of the public was shown in large
degree by the size ot the audi-
ences, and it is to be hoped tllat
the one who made possible the
presentation of the lectures. was
forgotten by none who heard

them.

THE PRIZE whicll was ﬁrst an
nounced at the last complence-
merit exercises and which will be
awarded for the ﬁrst time this year,
is one which should call forth a
large number of competitors, It
is a prize of twenty dollars, offered
by an alumnus, for the best poem
of not more than one hundred and
ﬁfty lines, written by an under-
graduate pt the college, The
English faculty have charge oi
the contest and will give any ad-
vice or inlormzttion which may be
desired. The ﬁeld is one which
has, in the past. been well culti-
vated in Grinnell, when the

 

"Rllymers’ Club" was ﬂourishing,

and we hope that this prize lvlll Ins
[use new interest. The renrgonr
zation of tllc “Rhymers’ Club”
would be a commendable step,
one which would insure better
competition and doubtless higher

standards in the verse submitted.

Pres. Gates in Colorado.

The theme of President Gatcs'
address at Colorado Springs, Mon~
day evening was "Christian Cole
leges and American Democracy.”

oquent in its outline of the work

interrupted with applause."

the largest audiences of the lee-

available seat in the church, and
all who heard him
