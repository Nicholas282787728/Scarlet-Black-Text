alumni and
triends of the college are urged
to be especially hearty in their
support of athletics this spring.
The football season, which is usur
ally a considerable source of reve-
nue to the Athletic Unron, barely
came out even last fall, by reason
of the Rush Medical ﬁasco and
unfavorable weather for the
Thanksgiving game, so the debt
which was carried over from last
spring is still hanging over the
Athletic Union. Tire athletics oi
the spring term are never proﬁtar
blc to the Union, anti for money
to meet the expenses of the base
ball and track teams, the friends
of athletics are appealed to to
comeforward with loyal liberalr
ity. We cannot have healthy
athletics, with the incubus of
debt ever hanging over our teams,
and we cannot rely upon gate xe-
ceipts to cover expenses. It
would be far better to meet and
wipe out this debt, before it be-
comes colossal, than at some time
in the future to be conironted by
the alternative of disposing ot an
overwhelming debt, or else of put»
ting no athletic teams in the ﬁeld.
Let everyone interested in the
maintenance of our athletic stand-
ard consider the signiﬁcance of
such a condition, which may be
not, far from imminent, and act
accordingly.

THE success of the glee club
and orchestra on their Easter trip,
is a matter ot unqualiﬁed gratiﬁca-
to the entire college and town.
Not only for themselves as musi-
cians have they won public tavor,
but honor is reﬂected upon the

.institution and Grinnell, whose
hearty support and encourage
ment have made possible the at
tainment of so high a degree oi
excellence. To Professor Cole,
especially, is due unstinted praise,
I-Iis administration or the directcrr
ship has shown musical ability and
judgment of superlative excel-
lence; moreover, he has mai -
taincd in the organizations, a dis-
cipline ﬁrm, but in no way oppress
sive, as a result of which the music

have won encomillms for
their appearance oft the concert
stage. as well as in their entellaim
ments. The management of the
club and orchestra this year has
been all that could be desired, and
those who have contributed to the
success of the season have the

cians

 

congratulations of all.

Track Work.

Some few men st. cd in Gril-
ncll during the vacalion to train
tor the track team but not so many
as could have been desired.

The State University has ﬁnally
decided to contest ill the track
events this splillg and under the
captaincy or J. c, rr-nll, we may
be sure they \leI have as good a
team it not better than usual.

Our vacation coming Just when
it ditl broke up tralning here to a
great extent and we \\lll have to
train more conscientiousiy and
more men will have to contest
in order that \\c may nitrite a cred-
itablc showing.

There seems to be a
lack of interest and a tendency to
rest on our past record among the
men. This should not be, Some
of our surest point winners lelt
last spring. Their places must be
ﬁlled by nerv men, men willing
to sacriﬁce something tor their
college, men who will work as
hard _for second and third places
as they will for Fllst places. For-
second and third places win track
meets.

For three years we have held
second place in the games of the
W. I. A, A A, and we have been
able to do this only by every man
working for what he could get,7
that is, working as hard tor a sec»
ond and third place as he did for
a ﬁrst; and it the track men will
work as hard this spring tor these
seconds and thirds as their preder
cessors have, we \\'lll stand a fair
show of wrnning out this spring;
otherwise our chances oi success
are rather gloomy.

A Graceful Gift.

The tracit management were
greatly encouraged recently by
the presentation of a thirty dole
lar purse. which the ladies of the
school had raised as a contribue
tiontowartl the coach fund. It
shows that an active intelcst is
taken by the ladies in the success
ot athletics and it s to be hoped
that it will incentive,
both to the athletes to spur them
tolherr best efforts, and to the
men otthe school, that they be
not outdone in support at the
teams.
