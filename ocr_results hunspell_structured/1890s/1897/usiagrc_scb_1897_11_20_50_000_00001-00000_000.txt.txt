‘EL‘BMDGE DER I ER RAND

The above words are On a memo-
rial tablet in the vestibule ot the new
gymnasium for women. There is no
clepartment in Iowa College in which
there has been a more satisfactory
development than in the physical cul-
ture of the women students. Mrs.
Siveri 1.. (Ringheint) Newman, ’89,
was the ﬁrst to take rrp systematic
class work, when she came to the col-
lege in 1890, as instructor in_ Eiocu—
tion and Physical Culture for womEn.
This work made a good beginning
under Mrs. Newman’s eﬁicient lead-
ership. ' '

Miss Carrie Rand was elected 'ln-
Structor in Social and Physical Culr
ure for Women in 1893, arid the work
has been steadrly improved in extent
and efﬁciency. We have testimony
of those who have had experience in
some of the strongest colleges for
women in the country, that the work
of this department in Iowa College is
of the very highest order. Certainly
Miss Rand has spared neither time,
expense nor strength, to make the
department of the best any wise at-
tainable.

Miss Annie Bell Raymond, ’97, has
for two years been Miss Rand’s assist-
ant. She lras devoted summer vaca-
tions to obtaining the best instruction
to be had in the country. This year
Miss Raymond has been elected to the
position of Associate instructor in this
department artd gives her whole time
to the work.

 

MEMORJ AL To .

Hitherto the work of the depart-
ment has been carried on under the
disadvantage of a very unsatisfactory
room. There was no-‘p'lace in the
college buildings- d' pted to such use,
A room outside, rnconvenreutly locat-
ed at sonre distancefrom the campus,
and in many :cspeﬁsarotaveli adapt-
ed to the work, has been rertted. The
trustees have meantime made several
plans toward securirtg a proper hous-

irtg of the department on the campus. -

Pledges to the amount of three thoue
sand dollars had been secured toward
such a buildin The dis tistactron
with'the ohm u use has eén 'con!
stantly increasing until last spring i
became so, strong on Miss Rand’s
part that she decided‘ to erect a build-
ing at once at her own expense.
may as well be an open secret that the
otl'er was an errtii'e srrrprise to me.
So far as I know no suggestion of her
putting tip the building had ever been
made to her. vCertainiy the thought
had not entered my mind that she
could or would do it. Her services
to the college have been practically a
donation and are so still. It had
seemed to me that this was so con
siderable a gilt that i should not have
had the heart to suggest to her that
she provide her own building even it
the thought had entered my mind.
The immediate occasion of her de-
cision may well have been a reverent
thought of‘her brother, 'a rtterttbei.ot
the board of trustees, Mr. E. D. Rand

n‘

ELBRniGE’oani-rr RAND

of Burlington, who died last February.
Sometime last March she said to me
that She would build a building her-
self as aPruemorial to her lather and
to him. Both rnen bore the name,
E, D. Rand, and it should be called a
memorial to them. This offer with
its conditions was gratefully accepted
by the trustees. The location deterr
mined upon was just northeast of
Blair Hail.

There itas been a wide illiSiliithi"
standing to the eti'ect that this build-
ing is erected by money which was
left by her brother, This is not the
case. Miss Rand builds it from her
.own means and it is entirely her own
gift to the college as a memorial to
her father and brother.

The money that had been pledged
by others for a young women’s gymr
nasiunr was easily diverted, with the
full consent of the donors, to other
uses, sortie of them irumedrateiy con-
nected \vith'rthis new building. For
instance, the heating plant of the col-
lege needed enlargemcnt by putting
in another boiler, and the heating of
the Library corrld thus be added.

As in all such enterprises, consider-
able time and thought were spent up
on the selection of an architect and
the plait oi the building. Several
plans were oflered by diflerent archi-
tects. Alter the Iullest investigation
and discussion, that presented by Mr,
Henry K. Holsrnali: class of or, of
the firm of Brainerd 8'. Holsman of

 

1897.

 

Vol. 3. No.19

Chicago, was accepted. Mr. Hols-
man had already done much of pre-
lirninary work in connection with for—
mer plans.

Although there was all easily pos-
sible expedition in the preliminaries,
ground was not broken till commence-r
ment week, mierune. It was hoped
that the building might be ready when
indoor work for college women be-'
gins, about November lirst, Because
ol’ delays inevitable in such work,
caused particularly by the fact that
the building is quite out of the ordi-
nary, both in itself and even more in
its appointments, it was not ready at
the proper time, and the classqvork
has been carried .on in the former
rented room. it is now practically
complete and will be ready for dedi-
catron in a few days. A brief descrip-
tion will be fotrrrd of interest.

The building is ﬁfty-eight feetvwide
and one hundred and twenty feet long.
It is rectangular in ground plan, with
one end rounded rrrto a semi»errcle, to
avoid the appearance of too great proV
portionate length. The exterior walls
are made of reddishrbrown vitriﬁed
brick, impervious to water, hard as
iron and more durable than arty other
building material known. The main
walis_are unbroken by windows, color
atrd torm giving a sense of strength
and stability.

The upper part of the walls is

pierced by windows as regularly as
possible, producing a lighter eﬂect,
arid further ornamented by the cornice
and other bands. There is but little
orrnunentation, any needed result be-
ing produced by bands of corbels artd
dentils designed to catch arid reﬂect
the light, and alternately cast deep
shadows, like long rows of beads.
_ The two chiel divisions of the build-
rng‘are separated by a round tower
halt-buried into the building. The
general style is or the French chateau,
modeled somewhat after the modern
Romanesque.

The gymnasium room is eighty~
eight feet long by sixty-six feet broad.
The inside wall. are of but? pressed
brick. The first story has no With
dows, the wall space being reserved
for apparatus. The room is abundr
antly lighted from the windows in the
second s ry and most eﬁ'ectively by
large sky-lights occupying nearly the
whole length ol’ the roof on each side
of the ridge. There is an excellent
running track live feet wide frilly
equipped in the manner known as
the “Robert" track. It is nine and
one-half feet' above the main floor.
Tire track is-concave at the curves so
that, the runner will be perpendicular
to the track at whatever speed, from
the w; ’ to the fastest speed likely to
be attained by college women. The
