“Ml Chamberlain has been Cnll-

a century, In all the college cir»

extent that no living man can

His life is a part of Iowa College.
It has gone into the foundations

No man in the ten years of my

great thing to say of any man,
No Achilles sullcing in his tent

that in the ﬁfty years history of
this college it has not had a more

years. Alas. his body lies this
morning for the ﬁrst'trme in the
roomy chamber that he had pres

not quite ﬁnished, Indeed it was
his interest. and enthusiastic work
upuri tlietn that was the immediate

occasion of the SlClﬂleSs that cost
him and us his life. It is another
instance of that which we so often
see of a mart movrng into his
larger and better house only to be
carried out. lrlrs home place, the

However. there need be no

Chamberlain‘s life has been markr
ed for half a century by that one
great Christian word ”set‘vlce."
No rrran who knew hilll can pos—
sibly deny it and those who ltrrerv
him best know that fact best. This
service was always Chlistlau. He
has stamped a whole generation
ot college inﬂuence with the
thought of cheerful. enthusiastic
service. He has given his Iile to
this institution. God grant that
it may never prove unworthy of
such a gift."
