As rhe srudenrs orCrinncll enjoy

break, a number of college adminis-
rrarors and faculry members will spend
rheir rirne working on rIie web.

From March 2361, tltc scltool will
hold a roral ofsir workshops ro rrain

anon ofwebpages.

The workshops were organized
rhroiigh rhe cooperarne efron of rho

services (GCCS), and insrriierional
Mulrimedia Technology Specialisrs
(IMTS).

There will be rhrec workshops
apiece tor rhe Macinrosh and Win-

For each operaring sysiem, insrruc.
rors will run dayelong (9am . zipnr)

websires,

There will also be half.day (1pm —
5pm) workshop on using Adobe
Photoshop ro inanipiilarc images for
use in clecrronie presenrarions and
webpages.

The workshops range in siae from
sro 10 arrendees,

This iSanot rhe firsr rime rhar
Gtinnell has run such workshops. Last
January, eoordinarors held rho same
workshops on web aurhoring using
Pagemill, but rhe half-day Photoshop
course was nor raughr.

Because of rho posirive feedback
from rhc firsr workshops, rlie coordi»
narors decided ro hold more.

According roTwirchell, who coore

rhe push for such classes had been
srrong

“crinnell's web presence wasn’r

Twirchell. “It (the workshops) had
been a long rime coming, and ir just

In rarr, Twitclicll’s posirion was

Through granrs from rhe Mellon

two orhers were hired as lnsrrucrional
MuliimediaTechnology specialises,

A main goal oflMTs is ro help
faculry incorporare mulrimedia tech-
nology inro rheir courses.

Before rhe workshops, adminisrra—
rors and professors ofren learned on
rheir own or informally wirh technol-
ogy .nsrrucrors.

Barliboi seemed ro be in favor of
reform,

“i believe SGA does a good Job,
bur ifihe majority ofrhe srudenrs feel
SGA needs to change, rhcn why not?
I dunk rhink rhere is a sysrem rhar can
sarisry all of rhe people all or rhe
rirne...ir would be grear ro ger more
people involved in SGA," he said.

Aside from rhese issues, tl-icmajor-
iry of rho people i ralked to seemed
generally pleased wirh rhe funcrioning
ofSGA.

"we have a grear group of sena-
rors inreraering wirh diverse
opinions...and rhe cabiner is working
hard and are deeply committed," said
Massrnan.

Jay Kecera ’00, also had posirive
commcnts.

“I rhink it’s good rhar rhey're haw/r
ing a forum and inviring crady ro ralk.
It’s good for rhe campus ro ralk ro
people," he said.

Erin Schmidt ’02, agreed. “I rhink
SGA is rhc besr way ro ger a voice
heard so rhe majoriry ofcarnpus can
have a say in whars going on.”

“sen is mere ro find ways ro make
life easier for srudenrs, that's whar we
rry ro do,..we try in caprure a campus
consensus but ir always proves diffi.
culr. I wanr SGA ro be more
accessible...ro find our whar's going on
on campus and go in rhar directioni
rhe hardesr parr orrhe job is re find
our whar people want," said beavers.

John Aerni ’01, VP/PAAreleCt of-
fered his opinion abour rhe currenr
SGAsiruarion.

“SGA is in a period of inrrospec—
rion righr now from which hopefully
sclfgovemancc will emerge srronger,"
he said.

Despire srudenr aparhy, SGA will
conrinue ro be a leading source of
power on campus, and rhe cabiner or
officers is consranrly working ro im-
prove rhemselves, andall foryou. The
poinr is, on a campus rhis small, wirh
rhousands of dollars passed our each
year, srudcnrs dean be more educared
and involved in SSA. It’s your money,
passive reader, and it’s your SGA.

Twirchell credirs rhe library for
doing much of the initial “heavy lift-
ing” oieduearing sraffrnemhers.

Twirchell sees rhese workshops as
rhe beginning sreps ofinrcgraring rech.
nology inro rhe adminisrrarive and
reaching processes ar Grinnell.

Said Twitchell, "You have to start
somewhere. You have to construct th:
infrasrructutc.”

For professors, familiarirywirh rhe
webaurhoring will hopefully pave rhe
way for online access ro syllabi and
handours, answer keys, and discussion
boards.

For administration. benefits in»

navel forms online (which is already
in place), and hopefully, rhe submis.
sion ofsrudenr applicarions online.

chcvct, Twitchcll is aware that
rhe new rechnology should be used in
rhe righr way.

“The web should be an augmen.
tation of the in-class and out-of»class
cxpeticncc, not a substitutc," he said.

He notes that the uses cited-incl»
ogy at 2 small schuul such as Gtinnell

Alrhough rhe currenr workshops
