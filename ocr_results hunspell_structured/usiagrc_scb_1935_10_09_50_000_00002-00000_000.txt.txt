THE GRJNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ot‘ the decline of the yearbook.

To the I‘tP\\'L‘Otilt‘i to the campus. this
may seem like a Startling do 'mi, and perhaps
to some liotrhcads an imposition upon the stile
dents by the fab lty. Such. however is not. the

Quite the control , it is the vow action
\\'l1it’il tn'o student 0 ii .zitioiis, Sigma Delta
Chi and the Student Council, requested he tali-
cn last spring.

The history of the Cyclone in the past few
years has been but one story after another of
lack of ol-gaui tiou and financial difficulties,
The latest edition, sometimes llllown jm-ularly
as “the nightmare.” was involved in c. ens 'c
litigation last summer in ttling the printing
contract In addition all sorts of difficulty
was encountered last yozil in finding- anyone to
manage the publi alien, and although finally
competent management his found, it w:
covered too lilic and the batik was pl'tlt’ilClilly
u'rct'lted. This particular annual has been no
different than those of the previous tow years
and the action of the faculty committee is but
the logical outcome of such a trend.

However, the suspension is but for one
and it will be up to the student body to
decide, durin the coming your. whether or not
there is a plat for a college annual or some
similar public lion, in the life of the campus.

Students should start thinking nou- almut
po, ible solutions to the problem of: publishing
an annual and whether or not: it will be pos-
sible to continue one. There will have to be
smile radically different and practical ideas
presented before the faculty will permit, the re-
cstahlishing of another publication activity.
That lunch is certain.

Win in Speedball

Dibble Loses Second Contest;
Clark Defeated, 1-0.

Gates and Smith halls won their
first games of the speedball sea»
son when they downed Clark and
Dibble by scores of 1-0 and 4-2 re-
spectively on Monday and Tues—
day, The third contest of the sec-
and round saw Rawsoll meeting
Langan this afternoon.

Gates had lost its first encoun-
ter of the year when it succumbed
before Langan 10—4, while smith
had played a to tie with Clerk,

Martin pulled the game out of
the fire for Gates with a free kick
in the final minutes of play to
give his team its narrow margin
of victory. Play in this game was
ragged with both teams having
several scoring chances, but fall~
ing to capitalize on their opportu-
hittes.

Captain Rand Carlson led his
Smith hall aggregation in a per»
soually conducted win over Dibble
as he scored all of his team's
points. He scored first with a field
goal and then later added a free
kick to give his mates the winning
margin. A pass from Dean to
Bray gave Dibble its score.

Preps Drill
for Initial Game

Truesdale Prepares Squad for
Mason City Tilt:

With the approach of their first
game of the season, thofrosh scar»
let and black gridders have been
“turning on the heat." in anti '93»
tion of their forthcoming night
game with Mason City Junior col-
lege on Oct. 18. The strength of
the squad has been increased by
several new players,

Coach John C. Truesdale has
been drilling the boys thoroughly
for the past few days on the funda-
mentals of the double Wing-back
System which they will probably
use against Mason City.

A dearth of material for the
backfield position is making it dif-
ficult to find a punter. Coach
Truesdale has two excellent kick-
ers in Farmer and Barker, but
they are both tackles, making a
shift necessary whenever one of
them drops back to kick.

“Blocking and tackling in addi-
ltion to brief scrimmages with the

 

 

varsity is the program for the
rest of the week", John C. Truies~
dale said Tuesday "The fresh
squad has possibilities of develop.
ing into a strong aggregation this
year and I'm going to see to it that
they're well versed in the funda»

.mentals, if nothing else," he fur
'ther Stated, “but. we've got to keep

our eye peeled for that old bugs.

iSPORTS

By Henry Hirsch

Dave Hill, assistant. coach at
Carleton, was in Grinnell last Fri-
day night to scout the Planers in
their game with Washburn. on
his return trip he stopped at Cedar
Falls to watch Cornell play State
Teachers.

Dave tells us that, in his
opinion, this year's Pioneer
team didn't look as strong as
last year’s team. Also he in-
formed us that the Carleton
team is much lighter than the
team they had inst year, In
another statement he made
the prediction that Carleton
would whip the Pioneers by
nhout two touchdowns, This
statement we tend to discredit
on the basis or the fnet that:
ho is undoubtedly biased.

This scribe is going to travel to
Northfield next week-end to send
an incomplete wire account of the
game for the Saturday issue of the
