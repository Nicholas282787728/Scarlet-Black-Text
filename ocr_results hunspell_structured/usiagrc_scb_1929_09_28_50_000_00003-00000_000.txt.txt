THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK PAGE THREE

 

possess arms and legs and will move
them. Soon they are sophomores;
then, successively, if not too success-
fully, juniors, and seniors. And when
they arrive at the stage of college
maturity, there remains little of the
boy or the girl who stepped lightly
across the threshold four years be-
fore. Superior, sophisticated, and
cynical. with no idle illusions to
trouble their well trained brains,
they nonehalantly pick off their
sheepskins and step forth, men and
women of the world, ready to wrest
their livelihood from the world by
means of bluff and buncomhe.

This fool learning, this culture
which they once quested after with
so avid appetite, has caused chronic
indigestion, and once free of the
place policed by professors, they

lusion; none whose ambition and pus-
sion for life and truth is sumoient to
enable them to face the facts of life
and retain a calm assurance and set-
isfaction in living without resorting
to the heltel‘ skelter rush and hurry
of modern life chiefly designed to
stifle disquieting thoughts and
drown out timeless questioningsl
And the answer is, “Few indeed."
Freshmen who come to college
are shown a great and lofty emin—

the heavens. This, they are told, is
the goal for which all collegians
strive and such, indeed, seems to be
the case, for multitudesare swsrm-
ing up the side of the vast mountain.
So the freshmen plucks up his cour—
age and starts to , climb, too, and
when he gets to the top he discovers

that he is standing on that great and
desired goal, the peak of complete
and common mediocrity.

We do not mean to imply that
the college is designed and direct-
cd toward turning out standardiz—
ed products or thnt the social life
of Grinnell is consciously organ-
i'Led to subdue personality and
encournge bannllty. But it seems

that in this age of ,change .and
transition, the great majority .of
students come to couego narrow
and uninitiated, but innocent and
ready to learn, and they leave col-
lege, nurrow~mhlded and prejud-
iced, but without the redeeming
qualities of innocence and sus-

Grinnell Saturday afternoon for 05»
kaloosa where she will remain until
Sunday evening.

Here they come,-fresh from the
farm and the town, the little glories
of high school yet lingering about
them as sweet memories and the
promise of future achievements.
Lads with the first husky cadences
of manhood still thronging their
throats, full of the exuberance and
thoughtless energy of youth. Girls,
starreyed, and lovely, l_ost in the won-
der of living and being beautiful,
dreaming sweet dreams and waiting,
