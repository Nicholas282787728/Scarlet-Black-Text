Pionee 5 Come Back But
Lose Hard Fought
Game 20-15.

Displaying a reversal of form, Grin»
nell Pioneers forced the Kansas Ag-
gies to the utmost in order to emerge
on the long end of a 20 to 15 count in
the second game of the series at Man-
hattan Saturday night. The game
was so close throughout that either
team was within sight of victory until
the end of the second period.

Over-conﬁdent of their victory Fri-
day nigt, the Aggies had expected
to ﬁnd the going easy. and were unpre—
pared for the stiff hattle put up by
the Pioneer basketeers, A sensa—
tional basket by Evans gavc Grinncll
a two»point advantage a few seconds
after the ﬁrst whistle blow for the
start of the contest.

Aggiea Keep Load.

Although the Manhattan quintet
forged into the lead in the early part
of the gante, they were never far
ahead of the Grinnell squad, the ﬁrst
period ending with the count 9 to c
in favor of the Aggies. The Kansans
kept their lead throughout the second
half, despite some good work on the
part of Miller, who was substituted in
this period, to, log in two goals within
a few minutes.

Evans was the heaviest scorer for
the Grinncll team, tossing in three
ﬁeld goals and three foul throws. One
of these shots was made from the cen-
ter of the floor, and drew a round of
applause from the Aggie routers
Evans gamely played through the en-
tire game, despite an injury to his
eyes. Bunger and Jennings star-rod
for the Aggies, gathering three ﬁeld
goals apiece.

Tight Skills and Flenthillttls
Make Widest Sheets in Blinntll

In the recent tryout for places on
the cub staff, one of the assignments
was a feature story on the widest
street in Grinncll. The following is
one girl’s conception of this street:

attempting to cross, with that light.

surely the widest street in Grinncll.

said Dr. Edward A. Steiner of Grin—

Our material progress has been in

vanocment of the ideal.

"Because we’ve pushed our burdens
on other hacks. we think we have
freed ourselves. 0n the contrary, we
have been cnslavcd by many of these
very things. When we were forced
to s end business on account of the

while in reality we were the slaves or

The protection of property without

by a majority of the Senate. I do
not regard all these reservations as
vital and am very willing to modify
some of them i! the modiﬁcation will

reply to a report sent to him of the
result of thc Grinncll vote in the re—
cent collogiatc treaty referendum.

that he has not changed from the opiu-

fore the Senate in February and Sep—

In the February s ecn be objected
"ﬁrst, to the power given to the league

obligation to respect and preserve the
territorial integrity and political inde—

The third, relating to mandates, has
