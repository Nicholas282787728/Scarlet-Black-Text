VOLUME XXXIY.
COMPULSORY CHAPEL.

The question 0: compulsory college chapel, which
has been followed With increasing interest by college men
and women, appears rapidly to be approaching its climax.
Certainly the problem is a Vital one, and one whose some
tiou should rest not unonga prejudiced and superficial
opinion, but limb a thorough and unprejui‘licerl knows
ledge oi the facts and a considerable amount or clear,
independent thinking.

The magazine articles which have appeared {or both
sides oi the question during the past year constitute a
most interesting and helpiul means ior obtaining an ini-
partinl survey oi the situation. One oi the roost reason-
able and readable oi recent articles in' deiense oi coni-
pulsory chapel is that by Charles A. Bennett, "Freedom
\‘stompulsion in Religion—the Issue Behind the College
Chapel Question," appearing in Harper's.

.4 The two main points advanced in the article are that

"Ciltiouill discipline ps- nccossu

suggestion in wor up, as provided b
and a prescribed environment
rot-in oi' illdivltluiil religion.

d ciplincis asiieces try to spi

1| prescribed iorin
s conducive to the l 'llesl
pc ciic nd llint spiritiuil
tnlil development as cdu-
to mental d ~elopinent.
Grunted that both these conclusions are true, there is
still considerable rcnson ror quc. 'oiiiiig no application or
them to the college chupel question. The lirst point scours
miller to be u question oi the iorin which the chapel ex»
crcises token than a point tor compulsory attendance at
those exercises. it is more nit argument ior a somewhat
iorinul olmpel service Lllztn it is c satislllctory institicn.
tion tor compulsory cllllpel. Of course tllc two are in.
evitubly linked Chapel is usually a more or less iixcd
lorin oi worship, and ii u i ed and rcgnlur loi-in oi wor-
ship is conducive to individual religious experience, then
by itll menus the student should attend c'hzipel. Granted
that the student should attend chnpel the question still
remains, should he be compelled to uttend clinpcl, {or un»
dcr such conlpulsion would he obtain the desired reuction
from the services, or the reaction that he would ii he
attended voluntarily?

The second point, although thoroughly satisiactoiy in
itseli, is oi doubtiul application to the college chnpcl
question. In rcgnrd to the training oi the religious sense.
the tollowing statement is made: “If we are justiﬁed in
imposing this training on ourselves we are presumably
justified in imposing it on others who are still by com-
mon consent in the early stages oi education." Is it en-
tirely irrelevant to point out that college students are
not commonly considered to be 'in the early stages oi edu-
cation’? One may well consider it the college student
has not ncquircd that maturity wherein self-discipline.
intelligently imposed, is vastly more eiiective than dis '
pline imposed by outer authoi America has nlwdys
been tarot-able to imposed discipline, even in the matter
oi higher education, but it should be remembered that
the benetits oi such discipline are still tin open question.
Comparisons oi the results or the Oxfurd tutorinl system

with the relatively strict imposed discipline of the Ameri- i

cud college have not always been to the credit at the
American institutions. . .

The ionic in much oi ell this discussion at compul-
sory chapel is that it is superficial, and nothing superfis
ciul, however logical it may be, can solve the college Chas
pel problem, The tundamcntul question is this: Is at
chapel service attended under compusion as beneiiclal
to the College student, his rcliigoii and his ideals, as the
svolllntary Chapel service with its element or lreedomi
Any discussion which does not attempt an answer to this
question is tor the practical solution of our problem a
mere waste or words.

it seems impossible that there can be any true some
tion oi the problem oi compulsory chapel until there is a
broader and more general knowledge oi the incts in the
case, a more thorough consultntion with undergraduate
opinion and n more complete investigation oi undergrad-
“ate psychology.
