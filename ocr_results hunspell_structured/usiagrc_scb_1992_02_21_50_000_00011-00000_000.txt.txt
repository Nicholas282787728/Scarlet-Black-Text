’ Men‘s basketball team struggles
' against conference foes

By Jeff Wirtz

The Men’s Basketball team’s
record stands at 3-8 in conference
play and 8—11 overall, afteravietory
over Iowa Wesleyan and losses to
conference rivals Cornell and
Monmouth.

In what Coach Arseneault called
“the chippiest game of the year" his
Pioneers withstood sub-par shooting
and a very physical game to beat
Wesleyan,6149 at DarbyGym. That
was due to a 32-13 halftime lead and
outstanding shooting by Steve
Diekmann. Diekmann lead the Pio»
neers with 25 points followed by Chris
Jacobsen who had 17 points and nine
rebounds. Assistant Coach Andy
Hamilton said.“thekeymotivationin
the Iowa Wesleyan game was our 2
point loss to them last year." and that
“the guys were focused towards
avenging that loss".

Last Friday Grinnell Iost 64754 to
Cornell atML Vernon. “Comelt is a
conference playoff team and they
showed it," according to Hamilton.
The Pioneers fought back from an 18
point deﬁcit to pull within 2 points
with three minutes left to play but
then fatigue set in. Arseneault said,
”The guys showed a lot of heart, but
in theirrurt they expendedjustenough

. energy that they didn’t have the legs
to ﬁnish the game." Diekmann and
Studer paced Grinnell with 13 points
each followedbylacobsen who added
nine points and grabbed 12 boards.
Arseneault concluded, “Cornell was

very aggressive on defense and cre-
ated as many points as they gave up.”

The Pioneers had another tough
game last Tuesday night against
Monmouth. Hamilton said, “We ex-
ecuted our game plan almost to a tee,
slowing them down and keeping them
out of their running game while we
shot well from 3 point land". Studer
and Diekmann lead LhePionccrs with
28 points each, including
Diekmann’s clutch 3 point shot with
seven seconds left in regulation,
which tied the game and sent it into
overtime. Monmouth won the game,
7777] with “thedifference in the game
being Monmouth's good size and
depth. As a result of this we got in
foul trouble early and that allowed
them to wear us down," according to

Men's track

Hamilton. Hamilton concluded that
in retrospect, “if we continue to play
with that intensity and that well. we
have a good chance to win our last
three games and accomplish our sea»
son-long goal ofa .500 record".
Grinnell has two conference games
and one non»eonfercnce game left.
The conference games are against 11-
linois College tonight at 7:30, and
against Knox tomorrowat 1:30. Both
games will be in Darby and they will
be the last home games for starting
seniorsChris J acobsen and Alan Tho-
mas and reserve seniors Mike
Patterson and Ben Root. The Pio-
neers‘ last game of the season is this
Tuesday at Wartburg at 7:30 pm.

The Grinnell College men's track
team turned in a superb performance
lastSaturday in the MidwestConfer-
ence south division championships
at Cornell. The team took third place
with a score of 86 points. Topping
me Pioneers was second-place Coe

192. The team is gearing up for its
next meet this Friday at UNI.

fourths, four fifths, and two sixth-
place ﬁnishes. Matt Shraeger won

of the pole vault. Hejumped 14.0'

Scots to over time before falling, 77-71. ‘

 

Chris Mills and Nathan Cook were
good for founh and fifth places re-
spectively. Other second- place ﬁn-
ishers include Tony Perez in the triple
jump and Rob Yamachika whose time
of 8.13 in the SS hurdles is a new
school record.

Coach Will Freeman was pleased
with the team‘s performance, espe-

cially because the top sprinter and the
top distance runner were not compet-
ing. He feels that they are right on
track for this time in the season. The
focus on the upcoming meet is to
discover which events or combina-
tions provide the best possibilities for
success at the conference meet
