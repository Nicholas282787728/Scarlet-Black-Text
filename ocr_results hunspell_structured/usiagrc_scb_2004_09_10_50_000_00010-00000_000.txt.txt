SPARC wants
your help

Dear fellow students,

outsmart-innate“

Curious about how the SEaiBttor the Rea/i210, the GUM,
KDIC, the Cytlane, EZNews, the HHS, or any other tem—
porary publication--gets its funding or who oversees it?
Ultimately, you as a student both fund and run the student publicat
tions and radio on campus.

Specific budgetary and administrative authority, however, has
for many years been delegated to the Student Publications and Ra-
dio committee (SPARC), a rive-person body directly elected by the
studcnt body. Set: the end or this letter for how you can participate
in this.

We, the members of SPARC, realize that not all students
know who we are, what we do, or how publications generally work.
SPARC disburses its allotted third of the Student Activity Fee»
roughly $70,000 this scmestcrito 1(ch and the various publicae
rions on campus, and also handles certain administrative and overt
sight issues, including complaints.

A Business Manager and Assistant Business Manager hired by
SPARC execute its policies and decisions. Media heads hired by
SPARC are responsible for dayetoeday managcment and editorial
content of publications and radio. And it is SPARC policy not to
interfere with the contentueditorial or otherwisewof its publica—
(ions.

Five media organizations-711w Sear/.21 {dB/ark. the Grimm/l Ree
tiara, the GUM, KDIC, and the Cytlom~are permanent. Others
apply for funding on a semesterly basis.

Applications for both permanent media head and ase
sistant business manager positions will be available near
the end or spring samcstEre-kccp your eye out for ﬂiersl
In addition,we hold annual elections, usually to coincidc with SGA’s
spring presidential election.

The members ofSPARC welcome all questions, comments, and
complaints either directly or via sparc@grinncl.l.edu. Also keep an
eye on out plan [sparc] at w‘w‘wsgfz'nnzllpI/znr cum, and our outdat»

Gun rack: regional
nationalism or just
macho affection?

Apart from an appreciation for
the television scries “Law and Order,"
which borders on obsession, the slim
amount of my experience with the
firearm itself could fit within the snug
conﬁnes of a round 7 or, at least, what
I imagine the dimensions ofa bullet to
be.

Admittedly,1 come from a
place renowned for its white
gloves, its oldetashioned high
teas, and reverence for the
elaborately designed (albeit
delicately used) sport util-
ity Vehicle. Parking lots in
Lake Forest, Ill, resemble a
museum dedicated to afhcit
andoes of four-
wliecl drive,
or at least
a wellekcpt
showroom.

Thiscnvironmcntofdcbutantesand
insurance kings breeds .1 select brand of
defense mechanism ortcn called by ex-
pcrts “white liberal guilt," The package
includes, taxtexempt and deductible, a
disdain for weaponry in all its forms.

Now, never having seen a gun it—
self, this opinion is surprisingly easy to
acquire and maintain. over the phone
or at dinner with friends from liberal
arts backgrounds, how ﬂuidly and one
liandedly we bemoan those below the
Mason-Dixon lilie, pushing for less re-
strictions on concealed weapons, or the
savages of the west, whose guneracks
decorate the posterior of their Ford
tour-by—tours. sure, I may have seen a
gun back home, but it was likely pur-
chased at the latest Sothcby’s auction,

gar--

mounted in a glass case, and probably
from the historical likes of the Third
Reich.

Upon visiting my boyfriends par-
ents in Montana {or the first time, a trip
to the ﬁring range was an expected act

it humorous to grab the nearest riﬂe
and walk around the house with it

Not knowing the gun lacked
its barrel, I promptly ran from
my seat at the kitchen ta—

Understanding
the Bacinos to be
good, Clinton-nos-
talgic, grcct‘itlov-
ing Democrats, my
white liberal guilt
complex derailed with this particular
event.

Latcr, John’s
friend, an ate
teuclce at another
prestigious liberal
school, asked John
to accompany him
to Wolf Creek to
shoot his new AK7
47.

He had already
taken his girlfriend,
John relayed. but she didn't possess the
uppcrtbody strength necessary for the
brute power of the, what I conceived of
as illegal, ﬁrearm.

And thus began my ambivalent,
somewhat tenuous relationship with

the state of Montana. Before the ofﬁ-
cial recognition of the Montana Terri-
tory, Francis Thompson left st. Louis
in 1862 to start a business on the gold
rich gulches of Virginia City. He later
entitled his memoirs A Tenderfoot in
Montana.

As applicable today as it was 150
years ago, the phrase rings with a m,
sounding quality. After three short
visits and one extended stay, I have
borrowed from Thompson in my own
work, realizing that my feet, pedicured
and moisturized from Chicago's salons,
surely match it not exceed the tender
ness otThompson's tamed toes.

I came across a New Yorker cartoon
towards the end of my stay in Montana.
In the frame two men sit a truck, dons
ning both bandanas and facial hair. One
is saying to the other: “I don’t know if
my gun rack is authentic regionalism or
just a macho alienation."

The sentiment fit well into my eve
periences with some
of Montana‘s residents
who spoke eloquently
on the subject ofgun-
ownership. Here, in
the realm of militias,
separatists,anclhermits,
they never dismiss the
SecondAmcndmcnt as
silly, which we seem to
execute with case on
the other side ofthe Mississippi. Here,
the tradition of lawlessness, aiid the
recollection of a time before statehood,
linger close the surface.
