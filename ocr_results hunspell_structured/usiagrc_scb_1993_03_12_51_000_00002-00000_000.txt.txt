come out of the college scene. REM,
Pink noyd and The Doors are just a
few examples. College is an environ»
ment of freedom that can nurture bands and
provide an audience ofyoung listeners.

Grinnell might not seem to be the ideal
place for an up-and-coming band. The 1992
Cyclone said that “organized cam-
pusbandsarehardtocomeby." But
despite this Grinnell produced
Stumbleweedand Poppa Mezz. Pres»
ently Grinnell has a rather healthy
band scene. There are ten really
activeandorgonizedcampusbands.
But it has been through individual
efforts that this scene exists.

The Gargoyle will take you
through the underground of Grin-
nell campus bands. who knows, maybe thenext
Nirvana or Bob Dylan will come out of Grinnell
College. (Hey, Herbie Hancock wentto Grinnell!)

What is the Grinnell
College music scene like?

in order to get a reel of the Grinnell College
music scene, the Gargoyle decided to ask the
people who make up the Grinnell music scene:
band members.

"I'm pretty impressed by the number of
good bands on campus this year...All in all, i
think it’s been a pretty good year for campus
bands, at least when compared to last year and
the year before," said Greg Vincent of BOX of
Toys.

"The Grinnell College Band Scene is won-
derful. ltis impossible to improve it. Grinnell has
many wonderful musicians, and they are all
tolerant and open-minded to other band's mu-
sic," said Evan Fertig of The lnStantFe/s.

”There are so many talented musicians on
this campus, and l forone feel very lucky to have
a scene as active as it is here, " said Matt Miller of

Dan Sharp visited Grinnell losl week. He performed
Tuesday in Front of a crowded Coffeehouse.

Rhys Iones ofMolly’s ranrysaid "The [Grin-
nell] band scene is ﬁne, i guess."

Ali Akgun, also of Molly’s Fancy, said, "I
think the campus music scene has been medio-
cre the past few semesters. It's getting better,
though. We have had more concerts recently
now that there is Bob's; we need the same sort of
place for electric bands as well. i think Gardner
should be more available for band parties.”

because people are trying to ﬁnd a way to ﬁght
against the whole lame Harris Center disaster,
which has completely f-ed up the all-campus
party scene," said Iason Elbogen of The Shep-
herd Kings.

The feedback was positive with some com-
ments that there were too few opportunities to

play. There exists some places to play, but not
many.

Where can bands perform?

Ever since the closing of Gardner in 1991,
there has been an increase in the amount of red
tape that needs to be cut through in order for a
campus band to perform at Cin'nnell. There is
little spontaneityin planning performances any-
more. Now periormaces
have to be scheduled in
advance.

The Harris Center is
huge.AsArloLeachofLiq-
ul’dPearlputit, "that place
is not suited for small
bands and intimate
performances...and SGA
has a monopoly on all the
dates anyway." in order to
perfrom at the Harris Cen-
ter a hand must reserve a
date with All-Campus
Events Programmer
Kendra Losee at the begin-
ning of the semester. Due
to its immense size, it takes

Bob's Underground
has a more intimate at»
mosphere because it is
smaller. But there is a Se-
lection process involved.
Bob's Assistant Manager
Paul Hodges explains that
"Auditions are given so
that the managers can in-
sure the quality of the
band...The main reason for auditioning is that
Bob's is primarily a business and not a campus
showcase." Also, Bob's is catering to a more peace-
ful atmosphere. "Ampliﬁcation is discouraged
only because of the limited size of Bob’s, and
because [Bob’s] is primarily a Coffee House and
not a concert arena...[The managers] are willing,
however, to hear bands on a case by case basis,"
explained Hodges.

Dorm lounges are an option but performaces
have to be okayed by the dorm’s Hall Council.
There have been many successful performancesin
dorm lounges this year, But due to the tightening
of restrictions in Gardner and Loose Lounge, per-
forming in the lounges mightnotbe an option for
very much longer. Arlo leach

5&3 about Loose Hall adopting a
policy like Gardner. This kind of

the only way to get good is to play
