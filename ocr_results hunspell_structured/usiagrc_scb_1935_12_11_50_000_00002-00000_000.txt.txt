WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHAPEL?

A losing football tealn is not the only thing
wrong with Grinnell. Among othol‘ things
that admittedly deserve criticism is the system
of ehapcl attendance. which is poor. indeed.
But, how can students be expected to attend
chapel if there is nothing to reward them?
Usually a 1 teaser reads a classroom lecture
on his peciality, or there is an advertisement
or explanation of a future cultural event. The
limit u a reached last week when three chapel
periods were given over to the advertisement
of one art exhibit.

What is chapel for? If it is to he merely a
college, «nurse of many subjects. as one of the
host papers presented in chapel this semester
maintained, then at least the subjects alld
speaKers should be announced so that one may
decide whether he wants to take the course or
not, But, should chapel be just this?

We say no. Onc reader at chapel rccelltr
Iy declared radically that facts have just about
brought us to catastrophe. At least most stu-
dents are already learning facts about as fast
as they can assimilate them. Thus another Fatty
giving lecture seems useless. Mere knowledge
cannot save a man! Note that most suicide of
the young is among brilliant students. One stur
dent complains that the more. a man knows the.
more unhappy he is likely to be. Moral and
spiritual needs must be taken care of!

Cmnpare 'the final meeting of chapel last
week when a student delivered a fine message.
with the others. Practically every 'time a stu-
dent speaks in chapel there is behind, or in what
he is saying. an obvious high idealism. which is
put across to the audience in all earnest manner.

usually n real challenge to tho audi-
once In his presentation. But, evidently nniny
of tho Llclllty are too disillusioned lo sllow
idealism or present a challenge. ll the} would
nlemol'izo thoi ubiori matter well rnough to
give a speech instead of reading a paper it
would ho much more effective. and they would
have more rhonoo of putting in a lilllo inurh
lloedcd Vim and vitality.
Not all of the faculty are guilty of this

< itm ll. but if 'hapel is to be, anything in ‘thel

i'nlnro. messages of real worth must no pre-
sented and in an interesting lnallnt‘r. Then
chapel attendance will increase, but not until
then.

IT '5 UP TO YOU

Ono thing stood out at the hoyoln
Monday night and that was the enthu.
shown by the cheer lelldels. wllo. if they were
present, kept them. Ives well hidden. in addis
tion. there was an impr ivc absence of mueh
enthusiasm during dinner at tho dormitories
1hr. same evening- and of student enthusiasm at
tho «game.

The atlllotilv department has been f‘l'iii-
rizod severely leecntly. yet. if we students can’t
show more euthll. ,in, p. llap we. had better
abandon any hope of O\ttl' t'OlllpOlng success-
fully ill vll ity athleti s.

\\'e do not feel that individually the stur
dents have lost ally elltllnsia u. but that as a
whole the entire student hotly worfullv ucalt
when it comes to actually. even nois y, sup.
norling the, team, Pcrhap. this is caused by
the, lack of cheer leaded at the games it so.
then part of ‘thl‘ difficulty can be remedied by
having then) present at all athletic contests ill-
stead of at only a few.

However. we do not believe, that this will
be the ultimate solution of the pmbleln and
that. after all. it comes flown to a question of
what the student attitude is going to be. Some
Students last Monday did not attend the game
because they felt that the Gl'innell Cause was
hopeless; there were others who attended but
already conceded the victory to the Loyolans.
Obviously, such attitudes offer but seal . sup
port to a to m. There have been many instances
of teams winning in spite of overwhelming odds
and in the majority of the cases it was because
the players knew that. the student body was
supporting them 100 per cent.

The, result is that the situation is left
squarely up to the student body. The team will
he playing good hall. but it llcc . support alld
that support can only name from the student

body. \
