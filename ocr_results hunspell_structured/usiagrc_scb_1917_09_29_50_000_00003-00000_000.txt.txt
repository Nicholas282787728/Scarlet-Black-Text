Art Parsons, ‘17, describes in the
letter quoted tronr below, the turn .
ters which he and his mates are oer
copying in the camp or the ambu-
lanee division at Allentown. Pa.
"Buck" Prelim, '17. Temple hurling,
e. 117, and a man named Brenner
trom Standtord University, are living
in the satire stall in a stable with
him.

“When we ﬁrst came here we were
quartered iii an e. rtbrtion horsebarn.
That lasted s days. Now we are in
the old stables used by the race
horses trained here, The barn is
about a block long and has stalls
9x12 ieet.

"We are indeed courtortable and err-
jeying liie even though we ernb
whimsically every ic_w minutes when
about quarters. Four years at col-
lege, some experience in a men's
house and a stag boarding club, are
,excellent preparation tor this sort
or camp life, There is ire hot water
and we have cold showers wrth no
chance to get a irot one by going to
the gym.

"Brenner ys we must have a deﬁs
niie objectile or we will become
lazy, so we have ﬁxed tip our place
until we think it is the best equipped
in our section. We decided to get
together and ctr-operate as President
itirrin used to urge trs to do. Being
backward i volunteered to do all the
cabinet \Vol'k. Brenner being an
E. E, spoke tor the lighting job.

, “Buck" llas Critic's Jolt

"Temp and I agreed that one men
might to have charge of the decorate
trons. basing our belief on the ﬂows
rating that was not done in our cols
lege experience. ‘Bucl-t' was not. at
the meeting so I suggested that he
be the critic. Brenner was strong
tor that, saying that ‘Euck' worrld
talre the job whether it was otter-ed
to him or not

“Temp did noble wor , the wiring
job is very satislactol), and 1 am
now wr ing on a desh of which i
am quite proud. We each have a
pigeonhole, and our combined li-
braries are on a shell above the dcslt.
oin- duds are strung up across the
rear oi the stall, and the beds are
hung around the sides, leaving the
center of the room open. ‘Duek‘ has
had nothing but words or approval,
so we are pretty well satisrrod,"
