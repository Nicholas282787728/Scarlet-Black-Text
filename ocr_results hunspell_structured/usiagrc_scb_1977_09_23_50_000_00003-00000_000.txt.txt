Few small mid-\vestem towns
have the distinction of being the
home of a liberal arts college. The
presence of Grinnell College, of
course, bears tremendous impact
on the town and its people, While
each student has his own view of
townsgown relationships and of the
importance of the town to the
college, few probably know the
other side of me story, How do
town folk view the college? How

important is the college to the
town?

No one in town has more interest
in and interaction with students
than the merchants. Student
business is important financially to
must merchants and many make
sales pitches directed at students.
For example, at Duffy’s, a small,
westernstyle bar, more Grinnell
students fill the tables on Friday
nights than townspeople.

OF COURSE, merchants like
students for reasons other than

Duffy’s bar is a ravorite of Grinnell students for drinking, socializing
and other diversions. The people at Duffy's love the business.

their wallets. Said one female
Duffy's worker, who asked that her
name be withheld, “The students
are always wellrbehaved and
Grinnell College is okay. We have
nothing against the college, These
are a nice bunch of kids. We like
making friends with them.” Yet,
she did add, “The business goes
down during the summer."

Merchants are all too aware of
the dear loss in customers that
comes with summer. One fellow
who works in the Danish Maid
Bakery said that everything “sort
of dies” during the summer
months, That season is especially
tough on stores such as Pepi
percorn’s, which is a nifty comv
bination of an ice cream store and
delicatessen,

THE MANAGER there said
about 40 per cent of his business
comes from the college. So, aside
from enduring the summer,
Peppercorn’s must make special
efforts to please students. One such
effort is special hours—would you
believe the store is open from 10
pm, on Sunday to 9 p.m. on
Monday?

But while Peppercorn’s may not
like Summer, it does like exams
The manager noted that busmess
increases during exams, which
may prove that people eat more
under pressure. He also gave the
opinion that Grinnell College is a
fine educational center and a great

CBS promotes black culture

The Concerned Black Students
(CBS) organization, representing
the goals and interests of the black
community on campus, is in the
process of preparing a number of
activities and events [or this
academic year.

CBS was founded in 1967 by a
group ofstudents who saw the need
for an organization to bring
together black students from
diverse backgrounds so they could
achieve a consensus and speak
witha unified voice. In the past ten
years, CBS has maintained con-
tacts with other minority black
populations of Iowa liberal arts
colleges as well as being active on

scampus.

GREG Wiggins, spokesperson
for CBS, defined the most imr
portant functions of the
organization. These are to work
towards increasing student in
teraction on a non-superficial basis
and to provide an outlet for black
political and cultural opinions. In
this connection, CBS has urged a
qualitative expansion of the Black
Studies program so that it could
become a viable major and a
resource for white as well as black
students.

CBS also performs a political
role, The organization was active
in the formulation of the Af-
firmative Action Program. This
proposal includﬁ a provision for
the immediate hiring of three per
cent black faculty and sets a goal
at five per cent to be achieved

within five years. It also refers to
the need for similar proposals
covering increased black

enrollment, which is currently five .

per cent and declining. Speaking in
an individual capacity and not as a
CBS spokesperson, Wiggins
commented that the goals set by
the program were too low, but that
its adoption by SGA represented a
positive step,

A NUMBER of events are being
planned ior this year to help build
campus cultural awareness.
Cultural and Political Chairperson
Julie Rogers commented that the
main purpose of the events and
activities is to educate White
students about minority cultures.
Other members of CBS said they
had been disappointed with white
attendance in the past, and that
they will try to reach more people
this year.

One of the main events spon-
sored yearly by CBS is the Black
Cultural Weekend, which will take
place this semester. Rogers
described some items tentatively

on the agenda There will be a
semi~fcrmal cocktail dinner with
speakers downtown that is open to
allr Poetess Pinky Gordon Lane
and Margaret Burrows, curator of
Du Sable Museum in Chicago, have
expressed interest in appearing
this year. Among films under
consideration for showing is “Lady
Sings the Blues,” the story of jazz
singer Billie Holllday.

ANOTHER event will be a
s mposium open to,the campus.
' he panel members for this are
tentatively expected to submit a
paper for discussion. There will
also be a special topic on South
Africa this semester, and the
traditional Black Martyrs
Weekend will be featured next
semester,

In addition, a section in Burling
Library has been devoted to Black
Studies, and an exhibit of African
artifacts is in preparation. The
exhibit will eventually be
displayed at the Black Cultural
Center, which holds an Open House
several times per semester.

Merchants like college for money, culture

asset to the town.

GROCERY stores, of course, are
the all-important lifeblood of many
students. Edward’s Grocery Store
is run by two marvelous, quaint
sisters. Hazel and Marie Edwards
make sure the store is stocked with
all the things a hungry Grinnell
student might want. Along with
picking up milk and eggs, there's a
great chance to tell all about your
hometown, hear tales of the history
of Grinnell or simply enjoy
“western” atmosphere. Lots of

students shop at Edward‘s Grocery

Store, but it is hard to say if they
shop for food or for a little con-
versation with Hazel and Marie.

Virgil Groth, cosowner oi Mc-
Nally’s grocery, wishes that all
Grinnell studean came to his
store, He thinks McNally’s gets
more college business than any
other store because it is closest to
the college He has always enjoyed
the students and thinks that most
of them have “very high stan-
dards.” He does recall, however,
one Stretch of time four or five
years ago when he did have some
trouble with students. That, of
course, was when there was a fair
amount of unrest on campus.

HAROLD Hanson, manager of
Ben Franklin‘s, also remembers
the restless years on campus. He
said his respect for Grinnell
students has increased since then.
Like others, he has noticed the
change irom the radical days of
“flagpole sitting" to the present
participation in community events
He believes that students today are
more serious about problems and
are not just blowing off steam. He
noted that the town has responded
to this change by otten surpassing
the amount of money collected in
previous years for the college
during the Tomeown Drive,
Hanson also noted that even
though people who live in town and
who work for the college make up
the most important buying force at
Ben Franklin‘s. students have been
partly responsible for the store's
success.

Dean Strand of strands Shoe
Store said that one week his store
might be filled with Grinnell

students and professors and empty
of them the next. He said he gets
along fine with students, but
stressed one point: he wishes
students, especially girls, would
care a little more for their ap
pearance.

"IT LOOKS like a lot of Students
just pulled the first thing out or
their grandparents old trunk and
put it on,” he said He added that
Grinnell College is a great college
and is a big asset to the com-
munity.

Jim White of Bates Flowers and
Greenhouse looks forward to
August when new students arrive
because it is a chance to make new
friends. He also consideis Grinnell
College a good customer. He said
students know exactly what they
want and are prepared to pay for
it. No college checks have ever
bounced there, which creates a
good impression oi the students.

THE PROBLEM oi shoplifting
was mentioned by some mere
chants. They did not explicitly say
that Grinnell students are at fault,
but they did say that young people
are mostly responsible and that the
college certainly contributes to the
number of youths in Grinnell,

One worker at the Danish Maid
Bakery expressed concern about
the vandalism that has been oer
curing recently. He thinks the
bakery makes a tempting target.

A KEY positive factor in town-
gown relationships is the cultural
entertainment that reaches many
townspeople via the college. Many
merchants said they were pressed
for time to take advantage of all
things the college has to offer.
Generally, the most widely ap-
preciated college offerings were
sporting events, concerts, plays
and especially the Physical
Education Complex.

Though the vast majority of
merchants think Grinnell College
is important financially and a big
asset culturally and socially, that
feeling is not unanimous. One girl
who works at the bakery said the
college did little but add confusion
to me town, Even if it does, most
Grinnell merchants probably don’t
mind.
