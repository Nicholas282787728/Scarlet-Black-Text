"Virtue and talents, though allowed thcir’due tone
sideration, yet are not enough to procure a man a wel-
come wherever he comes. Nobody contents hiniselt with
rough diamonds, or wcars them so, When polished and
set, then they give a lustre."

Many people, hoth old and young, hold a narrow View
at the meaning of education. The young man or the
young woman who has completed a course in thc Unii-ei»
sity, and has specialized in one certain hold is said to he
educated. But in reality, he is an ignoranius, He has
become a man who linens more and more ahcut loss and
less, but he knows little ahout the world in which he lives.
,, It is possihle tor a man to live to be a thousand yea .
old. l-le can do so by acquiring a cultural C(lllCttH‘Ull. hy
enjoying a knowledge of history. he understands the pace
ple or all ages anrl is able to sympathize with them.
Through a knowledge of literature he becomes acquainted
with the thoughts or great men which express the
thoughts or the people, Botany enables the individual to

tipprcciate more the hcauties or the world or nature; coin-
liine this knowledge with zoology and geology and a man
will ﬁnd tho world more pleasant to Ich in, Sociology
will help to make a person a liettcr citizen hy giving him
n vision or the prolilcins or society.

Mathew Arnold said that culture is "to know the host
that has been said and thought in the world " ttultnrc
is not the veneered sllrfllce on a trntcrni - man at a large
Uuh‘cl’s r, hut rather it general understanding 0! the
world in which lie liics, not only as it is today put as it
has been in the past. l-low much more interesting a thing
is it one know something uncut it; its name, its history,
and what it _ good tor. A man with cultural education
is glad to be hip c, and interested in lire liecausc he linous
something about lite.

'l'lle mistake ot a great many young pcoplc toda~ is
their endeavor to tind it short cut to education, and a
quick way to it inonc making job. As a result they so
through the University and come out an iguoramus. it
cultural education - worth having. it makes me more
iiitcrc. ting and hrings joy to the individual. Simply be»
cause a man has such an cducation does not mean that
he can not become a specialist in one line or work. A
specialist can have a cultural cducation it he wants to
take the time and oxpcnd the ettorthlt'l'liUR c. RISSER

There are two significanccs behind the Cosmopolitan
club. First, the fact that Grinncll is known so widely
over the earth. But the second lies in Gl'lllllcll’s import
ancc as. a college. It is generally conceded that one at
the aims oi college life is to iit students [or world citizen-
slip. Not one or Grinnell's students knows when he
uill he in some ioreign landﬁwhen he will he the

stranger, the alien. It is then to his advantage to he able
to adjust liimsell to circumstances that he may live come

tortnbly wherever he is.

Only one thing can really help him. Protessor strong
named that one thing in chapel. Tolerance will help
eradicate the barriers between races and nations, One
cannot be loyal to his own countly until his tolerance,
his sympdthy, his understanding are present to pcrceirc
and appreciate both virtues and viccs of his nation. tic
must know how it is loolied upon by other nations, where
in it can he bettererl, why it is worthy Tolerance is the
key to this knowledge.’

Here on our own campus we have the opportunity or
meeting toreign students, They may he ol‘ othcr nations
or of other rac . Through them no may become
acquainted 'th their pcoplo, their lanaudgc,
their customs and standards. We need not tml'el widen

l) to he cosmopolitan in outlook. The uorld is here on‘
our own campus. t

One thing only. in making these contacts, renicniher
that we too are being judged as i-eprescntati e of the pear
ple at tho, United States of America; likewise, that one or
us might have been the stranger, G, A 1
