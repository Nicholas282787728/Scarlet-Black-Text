The sutccss of the coming season
will depend largely upon the pitching

last year's pitcher, "Newt” Davis, who
pitched for Cornell against Griunell
three years ago, and Schultz ot Bea-
trice, Nebraska, who comes here with
a good record as a pitcher and a hit-
ter.

Heezen is the most logical man for
the receiving position since Leonard.

zen has always showed up well with

for the catching jail are MoCieary and
Disele.
