Comes “Back
to Old Grinnell”

SOMEWHAT CHANGED smuh:
STUDENT DAYS.

In the June issue of “Grinnell
and You" there is an article by
an unindentified writer, called “I
Came ‘Back to Old Gl'innell’
Obviously, the writer was as much
in love with the school as most
Grinnell students are. Here it is
re-printed in its entirety:

”Perhaps the whole affair was
a dream, Maybe I never did go
back lo Grinnell at all after twen-
ty-ninc years of absence; and the
recollection is a figment of ima-
gination created from youthful
memories and years of longing to
get back. Or possihly i did spend
a day at the old and new college
and the experience just seems too
nearly perfect to he true. Wheth-
er real or imaginary, it is the
same. I had a wonderful day and
1 want you to see Grinnell through
the eyes of an insignificant Grin-
neuianﬁunknown in his own gen-
eration to all but a few—like
Raymond Goy, who knew every-
one, roommate Carty, stubby

Rogers of Omaha, good old Bones,

Beik of Wapollo, liny McCullock,
and Munns Montross (whose son
I saw in freshman Chem.)

“Too Bus)"

“i was too busy in Chem. Lab.
with “Drix”; trying to get Raw
and Winterstcin to help me
through Calculllsiand carrying
ashes from basements, getting
food to tables for hungry, noisy
boys, blllﬁing through Pen‘lng’s
"Goethe," too busy trying to
make a 1' ing and passing grades
to be seen or heard. rll admit I
was in Chresto and went to a
class party or two. But those
were rare moments in four years
of hard going through college
motions,»7a sort of unconscious
routine of getting up, going to
classes and labs, handling quan-
tities of steaming food and buns
dreds of dirty dishes, and going
to bed again. Leaving Grinnell
and going home was the big
event in those days:

“How could Grinnell get under
my skin and into my soul through
a life like that? Maybe it’s be-
cause I’ve chosen_to idealize some
hard, uninspin'ng, boyish years
in self-justification put a halo
over the whole common affair of
drudgery. Maybe I just want to
make a romantic, lovely, touching,
tender, lace—like fabric out of the
real burlap it was, so I can toy
with it as though it were hon-
esﬂy fine. nonged to have it
like that when I was there; some—
times I really tried it, but it was
futile. I wasn't that kind of a
kid, and trunks, ashes, lah note-
books and dishesitoo realiin-
cessantly intruded.

“Things, Different"

“Yesterday, things were ditfer-‘

cut. I was a big shot from the
strange world of industry and
science. They admitted it by (181»
erellce. Dan Bradley had listened
to my tale of freshman woe once,
but President Main never heard
of me. Yesterday, I had break-
fast in the stately new house or
the president! And good old Prof,
Rusk, classmate Dave Peck, Ray-
mend McClenon and fresh young
Prof. Gale were there too. The
president,—»busy, sure, affablei
at one end and the president’s
wife at the other end. Little,
insignificant me with these im-
portant old—timers there, too—and
just to see me! Why? Would
they come back to see any old

grad who had never returned be»
fore? But. certainly they can’t
have any curiosity about me, in
particular, and probably not about
old-timers in general. They must
see a lot of such people. Well,
1 don't know, but some way I
must have unintentionally fooled
them. Anyway, I loved it! For

Grinneli:

“so I spoke to freshman Phy-
sics about physicists in industry.

“Then I spoke at Chapel! Yes,
actually! In the place of the
gray-bearded old grads of my col-
lege days, who were always “Cap-
tains of Industry." It was a punk
speech but I told them they need
character in business. It was
done in my day and I thought
they expected it; but no matter.
ithere were only a few students
in the back of the "new" chapel;
more of them were in pairs in
the sunshine outside, But good
Prof. Steiner beamed up at me in
front. and Rusk was there, and
l. D. Stoops, too. Anyway, I’ve
now spoken before Chapel, even
‘lf not many do go there these

"Then I hurried over to Blair
Hall to meet the 11:20 freshman
Chem. class. Boy! Did those
kids look good at close rangei
especially the well-dressed, lovely
girls! But the boys weren't seedy
nor rundown at the heel like
many of us used to he!

“I gave them a lecture on cellu—

and some took notes. There I

dean of women, who asked me to

ing-room! When I was a stu~
dent, I ate in the kitchen, or.
when the rest of the gang got
through, on the bare dining tables
of the "Club.” New I sat with
the elite in an oakrpaneledtroom
with vaulted ceiling. How did I
ever fool them into treating me

“Dinner was the new annual

more at home as the speeches by

in French; afterwards I claimed
