Last Sunday afternoon Grinnell’s
hockey team once again set out
for Omaha to play a game but this
time against the University of Ne-
braska

Because of increased “Academic
pressures" we left Grinnell with
only eleven players, the bare min-
imum to play a decent game. Hopes
were high, though, and Steve Lare
rick Joined us in Omaha. The Men’s
Bathroom served as adressing room
this time and the game began prom-
ptly at 9:30,

Despite the final 13-3 loss Grin—
nell played as well or better than
Nebraska. Grinnell’s players paSSA
ed better, had more shots on goal,
and put in more goals than in either
of the two previous games against
Drake and Creighton, But it any-
thing Nebraska had some hard sho-
oters and goalie Mike Levy had a
bad night. This was a far cry from
last week, when he probably played
the best game of his Career with
a save average of an amazing 92%.
Grinnell played a steady game with
a goal in every period. The first
to score was Steve Larrick from a
pass in front of the net assisted
by Jeff Dick and Larry Breskin. in
the second period Grinnell's “St-
eady” Bob Smith put one past Ne-
braska in an unassisted "Bobby
Urr style” defensive rush.

No More Bowling

by Keva Stubbs

On February 21 the Pioneers (after
winning 3-1 in the first bowling
match), tied with the Grinnell High
School by a score of 2-2.

Two days later the last infra-sq-
uad bowling match was completed,
The losers of this decisive gameare
to cook a dinner for the “Bold
Ones" (i.e., the winning team of
which yours truly is a member)
and Coach Anna Wack is touting
the bill.

According to Ms, Wack, both re-
creational and league bowling are
jeapordized by a laCk of funds. Ow»
ing to this deficiency, the aiternoon
recreational bowling has been ter-
minated and games will now cost
the regular price,

It is hoped that more money will
be allocated to bowling so that the
bowling enthusiasts and fanatics of
Grinnell may continue to receive a
taste of that particular vein on inn
expensive exira~curricular activity
for which the College is famous

Grinnell’s basketball team, now
down to eight players, traveled to
Northfield, Minnesota last weekend
when they lust to St. Olaf on Fri»
day 77-48 and to Carleton on Sat-

cord to 9-4 while the Pioneers fell
to 2-11. Scoring in double figures
[or Grinnell were Rick Sturgeon
with ts, John Haigh with ii, and
Charley Patterson with in.

The Carleton game turned out to
be more of a contest. with the
Pioneers surging within six poin-
ts several times. However, Car-
leton's bench strength and an ab—
noxious crowd helped them come
out on top.

John l-laigh put out his finest per-
formance of the season, collecting
26 points, He and James Casey,
who cashed in for 17 points, kept
the Pioneers within range through
out the game. Rick Sturgeon added

Saturday to out-psych and outswim
the Varsity, Winning all but two

dazzling disply of aerial acrobatics
and soundly defeated varsity diver
Larry Huntoon.

Ripon College at nipon, Wisconsin,
will host this year’s conference
swim meet this weekend. Grinnell
will be in the thick of the battle

With last week's loss at Cedar
Rapids in the Midwest Conference
finals, Coach Mike Peterson’s wreSr
tiers closed out their 197273 sea-
son. The campaign was highlighted
by a February 13 tie with Central,
snapping a 48 game losing streak
which extended over several years.

Despite a winiess season, the mat-
men have cause for considerable
optimism. First, it appears that the
wrestling program is to continue
next year (believe it or not, not long
ago it was doubttul). Second, while
hurt by the loss of sometime team-
mates Washington Alston, Jack Co-
uch, and Bob Doneian, several im-
pressive individual enorts were re
gistered this year. Third, and most
significant, this year’s squad was
Comprised entirely of first and se-
cond year studentseethree sopho-
mores and seven freshmen. Coach
Peterson's '“two perennial prob—
lems: a small squad and lack of
experience”, should be somewhat
relieved next year. And so the Well-
worn, yet appropriate cliche: “wait
‘iii next year.”

tance event, Grinnell should be in
