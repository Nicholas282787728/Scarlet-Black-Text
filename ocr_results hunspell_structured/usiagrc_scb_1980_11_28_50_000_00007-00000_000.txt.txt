It was all in fun

To the Editor: The vast majority oi
the people who read my column of 31
October took it the way in which it was
intended: as a caricature. I do not think
anyone seriously believes Grinnell
students are as 1 portrayed them. i
merely took an idea that is bantered
about occasionally and exaggerated it
to a ridiculous extreme [or the purposes
01 satire.

of course. as I anticipated in thatcol-
umn, there are the few who took great
oflense at the article. I can only feel
sympathy for these few pathetic souls
who possess neither a sense of humor,
nor the perspicacity to recognize hypor-
bole,

Most oi us realize why we are at Grin-
nell and the importance of a liberal arts
education. We are also secure enough in
this knowledge that we can laugh when
someone pokes Inn at us. For those who
are given to vehement attacks on peer
ple who poke fun at a Grinnell educa
tion, I can only hope that someday they
are able to deal with their insecurities.
— Sincerely, David Gil Molho

Cagers ready for action

‘ by Rob Brooks
_ The Grinnell men's basketball team
opens its 198081 season tomorrow night
at 1:30 pm. against Mount Mercy Col-
lege in Derby Gymnasium.

Tomorrow night also marks the,

beginning of coach John Harvey’s reign
as coach at the Pioneers. Harvey, who
spent the last ten years as an assistant
at Harvard, will try toth around a
team that lost all,22 of its games last
year. .

To do this, Harvey plans on starting

.froni scratch "I haven’t looked at any

of last year’s films," he said. “I want to
start without any preconceptions about
this team," he added. _

Players returning from last year in-
clude G’S’ZPM Walsh, who led the learn
in scoring, with a 17.8 point per game
average, and in total rebounding. Also

hack are Brian Samore and Jeff

Bedard. who were right behind Walsh
in scoring and rebounding. other retur-
ning letterman are Dave Nash. Phil
Guttman, and Pete Kupterberg. Walsh *
and Nash are this season‘s cocaptains.
Harvey said that the offense this year
will be “patterned with options tor any
play." In other words, as the Pioneers
bring the ball down court and set up the
oilense, the team will have the option of
running ditierent plays from the same
formation. '
Prior to the game. at 5: 15 p‘.m., there
will be a game between the Grinnell JV
team and a club team on campus The
JV’S consist of about ten players who

, will see little or no varsity action this

year. The club is made up of basketball
enthusiasts who practice once or twice
a week and play other eluhs in the state.
