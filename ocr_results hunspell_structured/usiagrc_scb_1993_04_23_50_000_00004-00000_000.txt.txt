Envisioned as a “church picnic with beer" ; Begun t0 satire competitive games

Moyer explains origin of Grinnell Relays

by Howard B, Horn

RINNELL Relays had the
humblest beginnings.
In the late sixties and

early seventies, the focus ofGrinnclI
campus was protest (tithe Vieutam
Ware The protes Ls reached a pinnacle
in 1970, when Grinnell closed early
because too many people were pro-
testing.
By1973,anarmisl.iccwa55igntxl

What will happen this spring? First

Berkeleeralhoon games at Yale.
They got the administration’s ape

“church picnic with beer.” Its pur-

The Relays evolved. By I974, a
parade was added, and Titular Head,
whichwasoriginallyalivetalentshow,
determined the mler of Lhc games. It
became an all-weekend event, with a
film on Friday eveningmiefirstycar‘s
films by Edgar Allan Poe were re-
placed with moral training films like
Refer Mariners), a Bloody Mary and
Bagel Breakfast in Younkcr lounge
complete with cartoons on Saturday
mumtng, the parade, the games, the
picnic and conccm,

Then came the fateful year of
1986, when Iowa changed the drink-

ing age to 21. Grinncll Relays was
held in 1987, but beer could not be
served outdoors. Itwas heldon South
Campus,withoutaparadc. and at the
same time as a party in Gardner, By
1988, wtthout a SubsltlulC for beer,
Grinnell Relays was gone.

This year, the Relays have been
resurrected. Non-alcoholic hcer will
be served. Students will have the
opportunitytodeinonstrateskills that

ful lhal the Relays will “give the
students a fresh perspective on their
class work."

 

 

Moore, Voyles coordinate
workshop for Iowa teachers

RINNELL College is spon»

G soring an effort to improve

the way statistics IS taught

to middle andhigh school students in
Iowa.

Grinnell will be the site of the
state’s first Quantitative Literacy
workshop, which is designed to help
middle and high school teachers in-
cludeprobabilityand statistics in their
math curriculum.

The goal of the workshop is to
show that number crunching isn’t
just for accountants anymore. Any
reader glancing at the headlines in
the daily newspaper can see that the
interpretation of numbers is crucial
tothc understandtngofcurrcntevcnts.

Presidentialcandidatcsuscopin-
ion polls to determine how well their
message is selling to the public. In
courtrooms, lawyers argue over the
accuracy of DNA tests. Buying a
lottery ticket gives you a chance to
win millions ofdollars, butdocs buyr
ing two lottery tickets improve your
chances of winning? Medical studies
show ihatdiet is linked to disease, but
does caring walnuts, for example,

really reduce the risk of heart dis-
ease?

The workshop is designed to help
math teachers use similar examples
from the real world. Teachers will
learn how to work with theirstudents
to design projects that rely on the
collection and interpretaLion of nu-
merical data From the projects, teach-
ers can lead their students to the un-
derlying statistical principles.

Martha Voyles, an assistant pro-
fessor of education at Grinnell, said.
“Statistics has had a bad reputation
becausemanypeoplethinkthepeople
using the numbers can adjust the for-
mulasjustso they canproveanything
they want."

But that’s not true, Voyles said,
and to get people away from this
belief, it is necessary to make them
more comfortable \vith the analysis
of numerical data. As people become
more comfortable, they will be able
to point out the flaws in inaccurate
interpretations.
