They’ll never allow that. . . will they?

Srarr rime 3:35 am,

Unless you're a senior or have been living in a
cave since yoi. got here for second semesrer, you re»
eeivod at some point borh a room draw number and
rhe housing booklet which rells you whar kind ofroom
you can ger wirh your absurdly high number (1 be»
lieve page 12 ofthc booklcr consisrs ofa full page of
Sreve Larson's printed maniaeal laughter). 1fyou did
gcr a low number, 1 hare you.

Burspire ove. my horrible room draw is not rhe
poinr ofihis column. Throughour rhc bookler, rhere
are numerous
references to co-
cd halls and
houses, bur each
ofrhcse has a eae
vear; rho meme
bcrs of a room
must be of rhe
sameses, Even in
group draw,
which assigns
rooms rhar p0-
renrially give
rooinmares their
own space within
a larger area, rho groups must either be sambsex or a
fured rario ofone sex and rhe other.

This convention seems OK to me; 1 have no
problems wirh rooming wirh anorher male
Grinncllian. Bur whar about ihe people who, for in»
stance, have more friends ofrhe oppositescx?Thc‘/’m
doomed to room next year wirh someone who they
eirher don't know or wouldn’r have chosen otherwise,
and rhis docsn'r seem fair. Every crinnellian deserves
berrer

This is not a radical new eoneepr I’m proposing,
either. Even in Grinnelleowued ofltcampiis housing,
rhere are no sex restriction57houscs can have as large
or small ofa male/female rario as they like. And in
non—college owned houses, there's even less ofa rc-
srricrion on cohabirarion. so why not extend this privi.
lege ro rhe residence halls.)

As the two halves of
campus were

sexually integrated

in the 705, it seems
like the next logical
step to integrate the
rooms, too

is it because “this is rlie way the Housing ofﬁce
has always done it?"Thal'x not true either, as the ovo
halves ofcampus wcre sesiially integrated in rhe 70s,
and so ir seems like the ncxr logical step ro inregrare
the rooms, roo. Besides, such a sentiment smacks of
conservatism, which is akin ro a dirry word our here.

Perhaps rl-lc Housing office is worried that line»
graring rhe rooms would offend some people's
sensibiliries. A perfectly reasonable fear, to
be sure, bur so ler rhosc people (or their
children, as rhesase may be) live in single.
sex rooms. I’m not suggesring that room
inregrarion be compulsory, bur merely rhar
u be an option for some people to
have in room draw.

Modesty may be a concern
Ofeourse. (onsldnrlng that in lare
ocrober rhis year Grianell had a
procession of naked bodies parade
around campus, 1 rarher donbr rhar ir is ofrhar much
imporranee to a good number ofGrinnellians. The
people who are going ro apply for co.cd rooms prob
ably aren’t roo concerned abour showing their body
ro someone ro whom rhcy are close enough ro room
with.

Finally, we run into that [hrcwlcrter word which
is probably rhc main reason Housing won't ler eoeed
rooms happen: 5.5.x. Rooms would become horbcds
ofpassion or some such, wirh couples only emerging
ro go to elass and possibly ro ear. Like rhis scenario
doesn'r already happen in rhe residence halls on a de
facro basis.

Honesrly, rhis is perhaps rhe srupidesr reason ro
prohibir eoeed rooms. Think abour ir_if you lcr
couples who are; shall we say, devorcd to one another,
room rogerher. you eliminate Sexilcs—ar lcasr a couple
of rhcm—in not one but two rooms, and therefore
make borh ihe couple and me people who would orh.
crwise have been their roommates happier, if the
couple breaks up midyear and soil have ro live to»
gerhe. .. well. chars a risk rhar people have [0 be will.
ing so take.

Prohibiting eoeed rooms for rhis reason is also

thirty minutes or it’s free

stupid because ir ignores rhe GLBT faeror 1fa les.
bian woman and a gay man. or even a srraighr
woman and a gay man or vieeeversa, wanr ro room
rogerher. what's the harm in allowing iri For rhar
matter, 1 do nor believe for an insranr rhar single.
sex couples have never moved in rogcrher in the
residence halls. The “sex" reason either reeks DFSCXr
ism or dcuies rho GLBT presence on campus. Borh
are dangerous posirions for rhe Housing office to
rake, especially on such a poliricallye and socially»
charged campus as Grinnell.

Perhaps 1 am putting words in she mourns of

the powers rliar bc. Perhaps there is a valid reason
for nor allowing cured rooms thar 1 am nor
considering (1 have heard
numerous people
menrion an 1owa
Stare Law, bur all char
means is rhar wharr
have said applies ro rhe cnrirc srare, nor iusr
Grinncll). 1frhis is the case, 1 apologize and recanr
all rhae 1 have said in rhis column. However, unril 1
see rhar reason, 1 must conclude that the Housing
ol’l‘lctior whoever or whatever is influencing their
policyﬁis being extremely stubborn abour rhis is»

know rhar gender lines eannor be drawn in black»
and-whim, and rhar thereare a numbcrofpcoplcar
crinnell who would feel more comforrable room-
ing wirh someone ofrhe opposire sex.

These people should not have to move ofreeame
pus ro achieve rhis goal. These people should nor
be forced so choose a roommate of rho same sex
wirh whom rhey arc uncomforrable over a rooms
mare of rhe opposite sex wirh whom rhey have a
strong connecriou. These people should be able to
do whar rhcy want in regards ro roommate choices,
and as a liberal arrs college rhar prides irselfon be.
ing liberal, we should rakeasrand. radical as it may
be, and allow rhem ro do so.
