SGA acts on Kent State gym site

By Julie Bi'nnd

Wednesday the SGA voted to
support the Kent State proposal put
forth by Jim Stuart after an hour
debate. The proposal calls for a
letter of concern to be distributed
to the administration and student
body of Kent State University and
news media of the area. This letter
would express another part of the
proposal: SGA’s opposition to the
Blanket Hill Site for the gym-
nasium annex.

It also specifies that the SGA
request that {our major buildings
be named after the {our students
killed on May 4, 1970, and that the
area of the killings not be cons
sidered for any future develop
ment.

ONE SECTION or the proposal
was moved to be postponed until
next week by Cornell Rudov, This
section reads “that SGA office
resources be made available to
Students organizing Grinnell
delegation‘s to the October 24 and
all other future demonstrations

against the Blanket Hlll site.” The
term “resources" was questioned
brieﬂy before the section was
tabled.

Much of the debate centered
around Richard Caplan's amends
ment to delete the sections con
cerning buildings named for
students and construction on the
site. Yet me general consensus
seemed to be that Caplan’s
amendment, which only left the
Section on the letter intact, was too
vague and weak for the SGA to act
upon. Rob Henak moved that
“Since the proposed (amendment)
did not specify how the SGA’s
feelings would be expressed, the
amendment should be included in
the proposal without deleting what
should be done specifically." His
amendment passed.

ONCE SEVERAL other friendly
amendments modifying the
proposal were made, Jim Stuart
pushed for acceptance of the
proposal. During his long appeal he
said. “The history of May 4, 1970,

has had all kinds of things done to
it, The true story has not really
been out to most people, The
govemment attacked a non-Violent
rally on that day. The students
killed were at least 265 feet away.
Jeff Miller, the closest was 265 feet
away and William Schroeder was
390 feet. They're claiming seli
defense, saying they were
throwing rocks, but you have to
have a pretty good arm to throw
rocks from 265 feet away,

“The gym itself is being built on
this site after seven other sites
were considered, including seven
acres of land that had been set
aside specifically to build a gym
on. Building a gym on the (Blanket
Hill) Site goes Counter to a master
plan drawn up in the early sixties
for the School. This plan was to
leave as much open space as
possible. The new gym would
destroy one of the two playing
fields on campus, a lot of trees, and
the hill. But more important, it is

and better programs were needed
In the areas of black studies and
African studies. In addition, more
nonrwhite professors would be
needed to teach these courses,
Finally, it was suggested that
Grinnell needed more non-white
student workshops, lectures and
ensembles.

DAVIS explained that although
Grinnell administrators may
realize the problems and favor
change, their policy and their
practice are vastly ditierent Too
many people, according to Davis,
are hoping the problems will
simply go away. It was carefully
pointed out that Grinnell is a
college atmosphere of in
volvement, committment, exs
cellence and pride, For this reason,
CBS felt that Grinnell should have
a much better, more balanced
college community with a truly

liberal education,

Davis also criticized the Scarlet
and Black for not giving prominent
enough page placement to the Sept.
23 article announcing the open
Iorum. He said the newspaper was
attempting to make the open Iorum
appear insignificant in comparison
to other, less important articles.

DEPARTMENT reactions to
STOPIT preposals were mixed. At
the open forum. music professor
Theodore Solis protested the im-
plications of statements made by
CBS regarding quality of music
prcIessors. Later in the meeting,
however, several music
representatives, including Solis,
made it clear that they would be
willing to work with CBS toward
the mutual goal of improved
educational opportunities.

Further, Smith stated that the
department was looking into
candidates to fill two possible
teaching vacancies. According to
Smith, though he had not been
working Closely with Davis, he had
asked Davis for advice,

OVERALL. the student reaction
to the open forum was favorable,
According to CBS member Julie
Rogers, “It’s really too early to tell
exactly how successful STOPIT
will be. However, several students
have inqulred about the campaign.
This indicates that some concern
does exist. Attendance at the
forum was pretty good and those
who attended displayed genuine
interest. In my opinion, the
campus appears to care enough to
make change happen,"

CAPLAN FELT that the SGA
was ”demanding things right and
left" instead of taking a
f‘reasonable approach by simply
making people realize that
students here and hopefully at
other Schools will not allow this
thing to be buried under a gym»

MANY OTHER matters were
brought up during the two and a

state of Ohio, Governor Rhodes,
the university and the National
Guard, “By building the gym," she
said, “by destroying the hillside,
they are in a sense destroying the
evidence,”

SHE ALSO pointed out that
“once the gym is built, there is no
way it‘s going to stand because the
vandalism is going to come up time
and time again. There’s too many
people opposing it. We'd not only
be doing something constructive
for the students of Kent by getting
it built in another place where it
wouldn’t be destroyed, but We’d
also be preserving the evidence, as
well as the memory so it just
doesn't fade away.”

An amendment to the con-
stitution was made by Rudov that
would provide all halls (including
some off-campus housing) with a
copy of Roberts Rules or Order so
that hall representatives could
become familiar With
parliamentary procedure.

AFTER MUCH delay due to the
lack of applications, the members
of the Resident Hall Improvement
Committee were confirmed. Alica

approved. Later Pat Baiocchi was

However, none applied, thus
allowing Baiocchi, a North
Campus resident, to be confirmed.
