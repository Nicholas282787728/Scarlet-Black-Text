Kramer Mcluckie forecasts
upcoming football season

BY KRAMER MCLUCKIE

America's eeanomy tame our tentative. The
economy was ﬂatefooted on defense, Eiiled to ex,
ccutc the gameplan, and did not get into a rhythm.
To avoid a real slielldcklng, we have to capitalize
on our opportunities and let the game come to us.

This college football season is die same as the
eeonomy in several ways—both are driven by ar-
eane, possibly malevolent forces (l'm looking at
you, Nick sabanl), both leqllire hour's ofdcdici .
rinn tn understand and both can go to slut in a see
endwnh these compelling similarities in mind,
I thought it might be apropos to dispense a little
college football adviee, which, though it won’t help
you make money in the stock market or save that
farm that's been in your family for generations, is
giaranteed to provide one session orbathiaom en-
tertainmenr (you choose which kind).

Ead\ week. I’ll tell you the ﬁve teams whose
stock is on the nse, ﬁve teams for whom question
marks remain, and ﬁve teams that are pulling a
Lehmann Brothers. My picks:

m

Barre Slate: The Broncos continued their re-
eord home win sneak by shutting down Oregon's
potent oHeiise on The Blue and displaying some
ottensive ﬁrepower of their own. Oregon’s LeGar—
rem: Blount sadly gave his own career a TKO. by
throwing a punch after the game, which had been
chippy throughout. So much for National Sportsr
manship Week

Okla/mm Sim.- The Poke: were dominant on
both sides of the ball against Georgia and won in
impressive tashinnThey'll live up to the hype and
are BCS bowl-boundTexas is all that stands in the
way ofOklahomil State’s ﬁrst Big 12 Champions
ship.

[vibrato Bo Pelini'a defense is ﬁnally living up
to all the hype, forcing three interceptions in the
third quarter against Florida Atlanne. The defense
didn’t look terrible, eithel, with tallliack Roy I'Ielu
rushing to. three TDs.

Brag/ran. Ywmg.‘ The Cougars' defense was
impressive against Oklahoma, even with Sam
Bradford at the helm of the Sooner offense After
Bradford's injury, the Cougars were totally domr
nant, allowingonly three seeondhallpoints. chi. ..
tcrback lVlaX Hall looks like a legitimate Heisman
candidate and BYU looks like a BCS contender.
Tius is my quaersleeper piek tar national ehanr-
pion,rolls

only buy four rhis week It’s too early and liu
not going to give you the really obvious picks (“I
don't tare what all the haters say, Florida is gonna
be goodl").

Md

Gemgia' Though they were handled at Oklar
homa State, the Dawgs are still a talented bunch.
Qrarterbaek Joe Cox looked solid against a very
good defense.

Virginia Terh.‘ The Hokies played well in their
loss to powerhouse Alabama, displaying a domi-
nant defense (as usual) and the kind of special
teams tllatwill make up for their encrvated oﬂense,
which already lost tailback Darren Emits. Now
freshman Ryan Williams must step up.

use: The Trojans have NFL talent at every
position, but starting a true fieshman quarterback
ghes ine pause.

Next/J CAM/ll!!! The Tar Heels’ dcfcnsc looks
great, but I need them to play somebody better
than The Citildel before I can buy into an ACC
team.

Nam Drum: The Fighting Irish shut out a very
