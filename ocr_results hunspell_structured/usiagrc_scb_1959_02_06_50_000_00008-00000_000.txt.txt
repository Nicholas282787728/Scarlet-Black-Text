Thinklish translation: This fellow knows more about polls than a telephone
lineman. When someone starts, “Hail, hail, the gang's all herel"—he counts
noses to make sure If he canvassed women, he’d be a gulculator. If he
tottecl up crimes of Violence, he’d be a stabulotor. Actually, he checks on
the popularily of Luckies, and that makes him a laudilor! His latest survey
makes this heartwarming point: Students who want the honest taste of
ﬁne tobacco are unanimously for Lucky Strike!
