Demands quality black education

Economically deprived black
children have to attend schools
that are not only undertinanced,
overcrowded, and improperly
staiied, but they also have to study
within a Curriculum that is not
geared to their language needs,
Busing black students to white
schools may eliminate the first
three problems, but it will not solve
the curriculum problem.

African Americans’ dialect is a
highly complex language that is
,ditierent in many ways from white
“standard" English. In fact, the
Afro-American language is so
different from the white form of
English that it can be spoken in the
presence of whites without them
understanding it.

THE public school system does
not take this language barrier into
account. According to a recent
University of Minnesota report,
America’s school system is based
on white standards and values.
This means that black children are
suddenly bombarded with
something alien to them when they
walk into school, Whites in this
country are in power, therefore

Bill Kowalslei

black people must conform tn some
degree to white dialect and Stan
dards.

It the public school system
doesn‘t take into account the dil-
ferences in dialect of black
children, then black children will
not be able to comprehend
anything they are taught to the
same degree as whites. There is
about 50 per cent unemployment
among black youths, black people
generally underachieve on SAT's
and ACT‘s, and prestigious in-
stitutions can rarely find “quality"
black people, This is evidence that
the public school system is failing
Afro-Americans

SOME sympathetic whites and
illrinformed blacks believe that
busing is the only way more black
people can become academically
competitive. Busing black children
creates more problems that it
solves.

The brothers and sisters who
graduate from white schools will
generally come out with militant
attitudes towards whites (Marcus
Garvey, Malcolm X and Stokeley

 

Carmichael all grew up with
whites) or they will become
chocolate covered white people.
The brothers and sisters who turn
out to be militant will either be
assassinated or spend their entire
lives hating and lighting whites.
The ones that turn out to be Uncle
Toms will not be of any use to Afro»
Americans.

THE public school system must
desnzn curriculums that are
geared to the needs of
lAfro-Americans In the black
community, black teachers must
be the ones to teach black children.
Whites in general have too many
stereotypes about black people to
properly teach black children.

There are no black institutions
with the same academic stans
ding as Grinnell. Therefore the
most promising black students are
forced to attend such
predominately white institutions.
The academic standing of black
colleges must be raised. Black
people underachieving in America
Is a condition that must be

 

changed!

“Bad S-F movies I have known”

While thumbing through my
Frcd Mcrtz International Almanac
the other day, I noticed an in
teresting entry, In the section
following the index of “Fine
American Jug_Wines," I found a
list devoted to “Worst of . , , ”
(various trivial {acts the astute
critic F. lvlertz deemed worthy of
labeling as the worst in their
respective categories.)

skimming down the list past
Foot-Stampers, Breath-Holders,
and Fish~Imitators, I came to the
category “Worst Scienceiiction
Movie.” I read on: “Battle for
Planet Zee. Filmed in 1943, this sci
fi thriller played for onlv one week
in various theatres in New York
City, set records for worst at-
tendance (see also Attendance,
worst) and has not been shown
since." That Was it. No plot outline,
no reason for its obvious failure,
nothing. Well, it was clear what
had to be done, I called off my
canoe trip to the Bronx and im-
mediately set to work on my own
list of bad sciencerfiction movies,
Here's just a sampling of the list

 

that is quickly approaching Atlas
proportions.

The Attack oi Brownie Troop
llsiAlthough this movie has a
believable plot (Brownie Troop us
is mutated into monsters from
fallout while ona camping trip in a
nuclear explosive testing site) this
movie makes the list as the result
of casting 47 year old semi-
prolessional actors as the brownie-
scouts.

Thc Seige of the Pope Paul
PeopleiFour scientists visit
Vatica. a planet in another solar
system, and bring back several
hundred Roman Catholic Paperlike
creatures, The creatures create
havoc in New York City where they
advocate abortion and ex-
communicate subway cars full of
commuters. The National Guard
finally subdues the Pontifls by
persuading half of them to'allow
women into the priesthood. A large
battle ensues and the two factions
destroy each other. Sound track bv

The lncredlble Slinking Man and

disappointment despite their
promising titles, partially due to
the fact that they were filmed on a
tabletop model of the city_ of
Chicago, where the belt buckles of
several members oi the stage crew
can be seen passing back and forth
over the horizon. Fabian and
Marty Allen star. Opening score by
the Mums and Dads.

Godzilla versus The Boys Town
Junior Choir—Gladys Levine, 71,
sums up my feelings towards this
movie in her review of 't in the
February 4 issue of Miami Sep-
tegenarian Nudist. She writes
“This is a trasher, the worst, the
absolute pits. Robert Redford as
soprano Mickey Gill does put in a
fair performance in the beach
party scene, but from then on it's
poop city. This movie‘s only
redeeming quality is that it's a real
goof when you're drunk off your
keister,” True enough, and might l
add that Kate Smith’s Godzilla is
her most convincing role to date.

Open Space

by Nancy Wagner

I've been pacing in my room
tonight lno easy task, i assure
you), wondering if 1 would finally
convince mysell to reveal my
secret to my peers. I mean, really,
it’s not an easy thing to admit to an
addiction. I should preface that
statement by adding that for
twenty years I was pure; my
downfall did not commence until I
arrived in London. It was there
that I entered the shuddering
trauma of McVitie Madness,

To the unacquainted among you,
McVitie's are a popular type of
English tea biscuits. I actually did
not intend to be hooked by a
biscuit. My flatmate had suggested
Itry a digestive I thanked him for
his thoughtfulness, but said that I
had not found English food that
constipating. Incredulous at my
ignorance. he intormed me that a
digestive was a type oi biscuit. I
said that Idid not particularly care
to eat anything called a digestive.
(Would you try something on the
recommendation of a man that
snacks on raw potatoes and cab-
bage heads?)

I ASSUMED this digestive
business had dissipated, but as we
fought our way through the
supermarket aisle the next day he
abruptly stopped at the tea biscuit
display, grabbed a package of
McVitie’s Digestives, and an-
nounced that l was going to have
them Wlth tea. I snarled as I
grabbed our customary 3 lb, bag of
Oliver Twist type gruel and
refused to speak for the rest of the
shopping trip.

Looking back, l suppose I was
doomed from the first bite, I
couldn’t have just one biscuitimy
mouth craved more, and still
more. (I just checked with my
American Heritage Dictionary.
“addict: to devote or give (oneself)
habitually or compulsively." 1
gave mysell to those biscuits and i
still wanted more.)

I began to construct new
methods of eating McVitie's
(besides plain): topped with
yogurt, butter, strawberry and
damson jam, cheese, or dunked in
tea or milk, I didn't even care that
a dunked digestive lying in the

 

(was

McVitie madness

bottom of a tea cup caused one to
choke as it slid down the throat. I
willing to sustain any
discomfort to eat my digestives.

UNFORTUNATELY, l was not
alone My flatmates had also en-
tered the early stages of McVitie
Madness. It was they who scoffed
at my unimaginative tastHand
brought home several additional
biscuit varieties, most frequently a
type with a chocolate coatingi
milk or plain. all to be immediately
consumed on the premises.

When did I first begin to doubt
my sanity? Perhaps it was the time
there was only one Rich Tea biscuit
left and we divided it equally
among the four of us, or maybe
when one of my 'roomies (the raw
potato man) went berserk because
he couldn't open a biscuit package
tMcVitie's being wrapped so as to
withstand a Iew decades of English
dampness). Was it the point at
which we forced the poor
misguided individual who brought
home another brand oi biscuit to
retrace hcr steps—or face a trio of
biscuitrstarved maniacs? I knew it
had to stop when we began having
tea breaks six times each day just
so we could eat McVitie's

EATING “package of Chocolate
biscuits in the rustling darkness of
a sparsely populated movie house I
convinced myself that, tor my
health, I had to withdrawicold
turkey. After London I moved onto
a small town, for what I hoped
would be a good rest tor my eons
ditlon. But I learned that no town is
devoid of McVitie's. Nevertheless,
I had been off biscuits for two
weeks; the color was back in my
cheeks, biscuit crumbs were off
my lips, and I believed my
problems were behind me,

Then it happened: working
steadily by iirelight, I was in-
terrupted by a hand clutching a
plateful of —Oh my Godle
McVitie's Chocolate Home Wheat
Biscuits! A disembodied voice
urged me to take one. In an instant
I had snarled the entire plate and
lay panting with the momentum of
my action. I lay in front of the
fireplace with a chocolate biscuit
overdose, dark stains on my shirt
front from hastily crumbled
chocolate.

Now THAT I'm back in the
States I’m feeling much better. No.
not every GrinnellslnsLondon
Student contracted McVitie
Madness. One llat had a similar
case, though it involved Short-
bread Seizures. Several groups
were victims of Bread and Butter
Binges, A comparative experience
to MM is Cadbury Compulsion in
which the victim becomes so
distraught as to hide his Fruit and
Nut candy bar wrappers in An-
thropology books,

There’s talk of having a
digestive detoxification workshop
next year (or returning London
Grinnellians to combat biscuit
withdrawal. Or maybe Dave could
swap some recipes with the Mc-
Vitie family? How about digestives
instead of doughnuts?
