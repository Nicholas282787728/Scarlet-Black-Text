leggett Considering "Model Bill of Rights”

President Glenn Leggett is
considering taking the follow-
ing "Model Bill of Rights and
Responsibilities" which was
drawn up by the Carnegie Co-
mmission on Higher Educa-
tion to the Trustees for inclu-
sion in the college by—laws.

He is soliciting any com-
ments from students and fac-
ulty on the model. The Trusr
tees of course can adopt any
part of the bill or none at all,
based on the recommendation
of the students, faculty and
president. The model reads
as follows:

Members of the campus have
an obligation to fulfill the
responsibilities incumbent
upon all ci zens, as well as
the responsibilities of their
particular roles within the
academic community. All the-
,mbers share the obligation to
respect:

3 The fundamenml rights of
i others as citizens.

The rights of others based
upon the nature of the educa-
tional process.

The rights of the institution.

The rights of members to
fair and equitable procedures
for determining when and upon
whom penalties for violation of
campus regulations should be
imposed.

As citizens, members ofthe
campus enjoy the same basic
rights and are bound by the
same responsibilities to resA
pect the rights of others, as
are all citizens.

Among the basic rights are
freedom of speech, freedom
of press, freedom of peace-
ful assembly and association,
ﬂeedom of political beliefs,
and freedom from personal
force and violence, threats of

Hey, remember when I ms
writing about pinball mach-
ines, and why didn’t we get
some for the Forum base-
ment’! A lot of folks (3 or 4
at least) are wondering what
happened to those machines,
and, since [was one of them,
I tried to find out. What I dis-
covered was a classica case

> of bureaucratic slowdown and
an over—concem for details
as anyone would mretostudy,
if they could sand it.

It seems that the request for
pinballs was made to the For-
um Committee (Mrs. Hawk,
Greg Sayre, and Jim Garrett)

Banning Garret
To Speak Monday

Banning Garrett, member of
the Paciﬁc Studies Center
(PSC) and author of “Two,
Three, Many Vletnams”, will
speak at 8 p.m. Monday in
South Lounge.

He will also be involved in a
panel discussion with Grinnell
faculty-members at 4 p.m.
Tuesday in South Lounge. He
will attend classes and be
occasionally about campus be-
tween the two formal appear-
ances.

violence, and personal abuse.

Freedom of press implies
the right to freedom from
censorship in campus new57
papers and other media, and
the concomitant obligation to
adhere to the canons of res-
ponsible journalism.

It should be made clear in
writings or broadcasts that
editorial opinions arenotnec-
essarily those of the insti-
tution or its members.

The campus is not a sanctt
uary from the general law.
The campus does not smnd
in loco parentis for its mem-
bers.

Each member of the campus
has the right to organize his
or her ovm personal life and
behavior, so long as it does
not violate the law or agree‘
ments voluntarily entered
into, and does net interfere
with the rights of others or
the educational process.
Admission to, employment
by, and promotion within the
mmpus shall accord with the
provisions against discrimin-
ation in the general law.

All members of the campus
have other responsibilities
and rights based upon the
nature of the educational pro*
cess and the requirements of
the search for truth and its
free presentation. These
rights and responsibilities in-
clude:

Obligation to respect the fre
eedom to teach, to learn, and
to conduct research and pub-
lish findings in the spirit of
free inquiry.

Institutional censorship and
individual or group intoler-

..ance of the opinions of others

are, inconsistent with this fr-
eedom.
Freedom to teachandtolearn

That Stopped

which, you would think, would
have say over what happened
in the Forum, right? Of course
not. The students on the Forum
Committee, Greg and Jim,
recommended to the Forum
director, Mrs. Hawk, that we
get the pinballs. Mrs. Hawk
then raised approximately 87
objections, primarily as to
whether students really wan-
ted them and the noise that
would be created. So a poll
was taken among the students,
and the vote was overwhelm-
ingly in favor ofpinball machr
ines. So, since the students
raised their collective voice
in favor of pinballs, theywere
installed, right? Wrong again.
Just because students voted
in favor of something doesn‘t
mean it has to happen, which
is how a lot of changes are
avoided here.

Next, the Admissions Office
and the counselors ﬂown in
the basement were polled ab-
out the noise. The conclusion
was that the noise would be
more annoying than typewrit-
ers. But it was agreed that
the pinballs would notbeplug-
god in until 5 PM, which is
no handicap to a pinball wiz-
ard who mn’ttell time. Having
dealt with these objections, the
next step in the obsmcle
course was another committee

point, a clean, who shall re-

pinballs actually gambling,
because they give away free
games? Every bowling alley
in the world has pinball ma-
chines without worrying ab~
out this point, but not the
Grinnell College Forum. (Ob-
viously our concern for gam-
bling is narrow, because isn't

which is illegal in Iowa ’1) Any-
way, the Grinnell police al-
most laughed out loud when
Greg Sayre called about this.
So now we get pinball mach‘
ines, right? Well, maybe. As
[wrote this on Wednesday, the
Student Services committee
was going to vote on the issue.
The implications of thishas-
sle are staggering. The stud-
ents want pinballs; they vote
in a poll overwhelmingly that
way. Their representatives on
committees vote in favor of
pinballs. Andnopinballsl Non-
students have sought to block

Wall Bypasses

The Housing Committee and
two project house applimnts
were disturbed recently when
Dean of the College Joseph
Wall announced without cons
suiting the Housing Commit-
tee that one of the two project
houses for next year would be
the Russian House.

The committee had under»
stood that it was to determine
the occupants of the project
houses, and it was boﬂi surr
prised and disturbed at the
dean's action.

Dean Wall told the 5&8 that
he became involved in the
project houses because of
their academic orientation. He
has long encouraged language
houses; therefore, when a
Russian professor asked him
for an endorsement early in
the school year (when it was
thought that there would be
two more project houses),
Dean Wall very willingly gave
it.

When final applications came
due for the project houses,
the Russian people mme to
Dean Wall, who awarded them
one of the houses since he felt

ters of direct concern.

Members of the campus who
have a continuing association
with the institution and who
have substantial authority and
security have an especially
strong obligation to maintain
an environment conducive to
respect for the rights of others
and fulfillment of academic
responsibilities.

Tennred facultyshouldmainr
rain the highest standards in
performance of their acade~
mic responsibilities.

responsibility to pretect the
integrity of the acadEmlcpror

nal atmcks; and to prevent the

he had made a commitment to
them.

The Housing Committee held
a lottery for the one remains
ing house, which was awarded
to the music group over the.
art group.

Dean Wall will recommend a
procedure for next year in
which there is an early dead-
line for project houses; the
Housing Committee will make
recommendations to him; and
if he disagrees with any res
Commendations, he will return
to the committee for negotiar
tions.

shing his position as head

College in order to concen-
trate on his duties as chair
man of the Department of Phy-

He will be succeeded as head

two years.

Committee Positions Unlilled

Fellow Students:

Because of thepoor response
to the initialrequest forappli-
rations, many of the student»
faculty, SGA, and Committee
A committees will be re-
opened for applications this
week.

Most of us have complained
at one time or another about
the way decisions are made or
not made on this campus. The
present committee structure,
a follow-up toa series ofmass
meetings for "student pow-
er", was set up not only to
redress this situation butalso
to officially include students in
the administration of the cola
lege. If these committees are
not functioning decisions go
by default'to the administra-
tion and faculty; thereby exa-
cerbating the problems in the
decision-making process. To
let the committees go fallow
and to simultaneously fail to
provide an alternative system
for' student input is to relin-
quish the authority we’ve been
clamoring for over the past
few years.

The Publications Committee
has named Steve Grow and
Mark Sableman to be co-edi-
tors for The Scarletand Black
next year. BOth are seniors.

Sableman has six semesters
experience as an 8818 repor-
ter, while Grow worked on the
paper for two semesters dur-
ing his time here.

Al Sdioene was reappointed
business manager for next
year‘s paper.

Grinnell committees, like
those anywhere, involvea cer
tain amount of unexciting
work, but: they also deal with
important issues that affect
each one ofus directly. Apathy
toward these positions goes
much deeper than a disintere
est in SSA; at stakeis the role
of students in theircommu~
nity. For these reasons, I ens
courage you to apply for a
committee position.
