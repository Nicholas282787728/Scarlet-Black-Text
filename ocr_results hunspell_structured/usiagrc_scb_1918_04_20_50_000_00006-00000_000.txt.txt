PROFESSOR SCITEVE’S RECITAL
(From Grinncll Herald.)

Protesser E, E. Scheve‘s organ recite
al on Wednesday afternoon was a rest-
ful inter-hide in these days so marked
by news of battle and bloodshed from
across the sea. It was the last of the
series given by Protessars Sehcve and
hiatlaclr and Elias Blirin of the School
oi Music faculty. Professor Schevc
had chosen a program in which soft
and restful citects predominated. It
opened with the suite Religioso from
“Ten Organ Pieces" by Dirhois, Sues
ceerled by- three Songs of Lament,
which were followed in turn by Songs
oi Consolation. The ﬁnale from Free
lessor Scheve's oivn Sonata in E ﬂat
mirror was the closing number.

Professor Solievc played with his
risual ﬁne artistry and appreciation,
and all who attended went away roe
fr-eslicd and strengthened by this quiet
and melodious twilight hour.

An unusuzil and interesting feature

- was the reading by Miss Mabel For-d

Yeouiaus of Temiysou's stir-ring hair
lad, "The Revenge," accompanied by
organ improvisations by Professor
Seiieve. The ﬁne old tribute to Engr
lislr valor was given with spirit and
was helped by the musical setting.
