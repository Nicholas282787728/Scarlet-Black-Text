PATIENT RUNS UN THAGK

Wright, shimmer vicmh, Ei'lltlcs tlic
Qllul'ulliille mill 'J'rtlills For Track
on Word Field.

Grinnell's lonc smallpox victim is
not as sick as the forbidding appear-
ance or his abode in the grandstand
on Ward Field might indicate. The
big yellow sign, with its “keep out"
warning, may serve to keep ordinary
citizens at their distance, but it will
not keep Harry Wi ht, thc aitllcted
man, within his prison. It was only
yesterday that he might have been
seen taking a turn around the cinder
track in a manner such as is not cuss
tonlal'y to those confined with small»
pox.

According to Dr. E. . I-larris, who
is attending him, Wright is on full
feed and perfectly contented with his
private apartments. He has plenty of
fuel and is perfectly able to throw it
in the store which has been put in,
Dr. Har 5 says that it is as warm as
the average room, and probably warms
er than the average class room during
the last few days.

No new cases of smallpox or scarlet
fever have developed, hilt Estelle Es~
den, ’20. is reported as having some
down with chicken pox. The patient
is progressing nicely except for the
fact that she is impatient.

“The righteous shall not suffer from

while snowflakes gradually whitened

“COMEDY ﬂF ERRORS”

ll‘ slittllmll Trolllms Put. On Tim Act.
Burlt‘squHGrinnell Chorus Is
About Ratio of 40 To
3 Better.

A company of young men, purported
to be the Des Moines college basket-
ball Loam, staged a twosact burlesque
on the “Comedy or Errors” here last
Saturday night. It was a return ch»
gagement, as a. company under the
same management made a very suc-
eesstul one night stand here last year.
A capacity house greeted the perform—
ance which was a scream from start
to iihish. The Grinnell chorus, whose
playing teatured the act, scored a big
hit, and their work was rated to be in
a ratio of to to 3 better than the rest
or the cast.

As usual, the guarding of the Grins

iloines never made a iieltl goal, their
three points coming through the toul
route in the lust half. Substitutions

Coach Carney used Ills recruits frCElY.
Dagge Went. the entire route, and CD1-
lecletl three long goals. For the ot-
tense )leacham starred by getting x
baskets helm-e the coach gave him a.
chance to retire. Augustine counted
four goals, “Dulch” Miller three, and
Targgal't two, Captain Salmon put: up
the best game for thc \loltors, although
Johnson showed good possi ties as
a distance track man, and gave Norris
a good work—out.
