Dunlop Finisheé/SO
Wi+h Two Recordsﬁ
Could 'Break IOOO'l

When Dave Dunlop finished"
the recent court season with a
total of 374 points, he broke,
the single year scoring mark on
301 set by J. Nash in 1940. '

Dunlop also holds the Grin—
nell record for the most points.
in one game by virtue of his:
as markers against Knox in‘
February. With 613 points in two
seasons, he thus has a chance
of entering the select ”1000’"
circle before graduation. l

He is sure of smashing the
allatlme three-year scoring total‘
of 661 established by Jim slutz
back in 191041-12. Earl Peisneri
holds the all-time Pioneer tour-i
year record with 754 points.

ty cage scoring:

Hold It, Girls,
We Didn’t Say It;
Blame It on ACP

Reporters of the ”Michigan
State News” took a posture sur—
vey of coeds on a Sunday after—
noon in the Union Grill. They
report a pronounced slouch on
60% of the coeds observed:

“A slouch not only makes a
woman look sloppy, it affects
her personality and her physic-
al welfare."

“It's a shame that so many of
the suacalled ‘cream of woman
hood’ should carry themselves as
if they were frightened,"

The article goes on to quote
from “State Board Questions and
Answers for Nurses:” |

“Question: What elfect does;
poor posture have on one’s mena
tal attitude?

“Answer: Poor posture comes
to be associated with the grumb—
ling, dissatisfied and unhappy
individual. Any effect on the
physical well—being will sooner
or later be reflected in the men—
tal outlook. Good posture sug-‘
gests good breeding, alertness of
mind, fearlessncss, and an attrac-
tive personality, although people
may possess more character and
desirable personality traits than
bearing indicates."
