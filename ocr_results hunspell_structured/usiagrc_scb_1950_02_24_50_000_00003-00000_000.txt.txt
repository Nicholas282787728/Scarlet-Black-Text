MLife In the Trailer Camp:
Some say ‘ Yes’ Others ‘Oh’!

 

 

 

 

 

 

BY Joan Wuhl

Only half a block from the

trailer Camp which elght College students and their famllles call

home. -

Three of these are privately owned and the rest belong to the
college. Several trailers no longer ln use dot the landscape

Painted a rather drab gray, the
college trailers for the most part
are small, twoel‘oomed attairs
which cost the students $17.50 a
month tor rent and water, Two
of the school-owned ones, hows
ever, are larger and more com-
tortable. They rent tor $20 a
month.

These larger trailers are worth
the extra money. They have oil
heaters while the other college
ones are heated with bottled
gas which is more expenslve. 1n
the end the cost is pretty much
me same.

Stove, Heater, Couch

Furnishings in the smaller

ones include a stove, a heater,
and a studio couch, There isn’t
room tor much else Only the
stove and heater and a bullteln
ice box are pl‘ovtded in the two
larger trailers.
' Beth Harris is quite satisfied
with life in the camp. The Har-
rlses moved into one of the
larger places at semesters, They
have three rooms including kite
enen, a small bedroom, and a
living room. The ﬂoors are a
light linoleum. The living room
is large enough for their own
sofa, desk, table and chest of
drawers and could probably
hold more without too much
crowding.

“It’s really not too bad," ace
cording to Beth. “It depends a
kit on what you expect to find,”
she added. “We like it better
than any other place we‘ve llv-
ed in; at least, it's pretty pri-
vate like having a home 01 our
own."

"Okay It Ynu‘re Not There"

One of the students who lived
in the camp first semester, Don
Gregg, is glad that he and his
lamily were able to get out of
their trailer and into the bar-
racks.

“It’s not too bad for two peo-
ple," he said, “if they're not
there all the time, but it's pret-
ty bad when you have chil~
dren.“

in Winter; he said, their traile
er was pretty dratty. In some
of the places the window frames
were warped, making it almost
impossible to keep the trailers
warm. The chipped paint on the

inside of some made house

chair, there is a washing ma-lKeRw Schedule

chine and one washtub set on a
stand in the women’s part or
the utility house, 1

One other drawback, at least
this winter, has been that the

snow plow which used to go iz'

over the driveways and paths ‘3

the vicinity lately. As a resulti
the snow and slush make foot—rm

keeping almost seem like a use—1
less task. i

For people like Carl Heller:
and his family who have their
own trader, life is brighter, The,
Hellers have a new trailer with
wood panel walls and Compact
kitchenette unit.

“It isn't the worst place I’ve
ever been in, but it isn’t good by‘
any means," said Heller who‘
served in the army.

Trudge Through The Snow

The most inconvenient things
for all the families is having to

winter and the mud of the spring
ahd~tall to get to the utility
house which serves the whole
camp, Except for one tamily
which has its own water, all
the others can get water only
in the utility house.

”At least We could get hot
water most of the time," Gregg
said. But he considers it rather
unhealthy tor so many families
to have to share the same fa-
cilltles.

The inside of the utility house
was painted this year which at
least make: it 100k better 21-
though it’s still pretty hard to
keep clean.
