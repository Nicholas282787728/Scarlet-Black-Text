Extraordinary situations demand exe
traordinary actions. Regardless ot
Griniiells policy a year ago. or a year
trom new, at present ive should have
every opportunity possihle to study
THE WAR and prepare ourselves 101'
sehlcu in THE \VAB. whether it he
miiltaiy or civil service.

We should as never hcrore realize
our responsibilities to the state and

nation.
Special war studies include two

things: First, detailed study in mili-
tary tactics. army organization. French
conversation. etc. which will soon be
supplied in Grinneil hy the Pow . iek
county council cl del'cnse. Every
G nnell man who can spare the time
without interioring ivith the regular
and absolutely neeessar activities or
college lite. should reg stcr tor that
worh. It will he practical and will he
a decided aid to the man who will soon
go to a training camp.

secondly. war study courses which
pry into the causes ot this war, ot war
in general. anti the means or solving
the conditions grow g out of the war,
are vitally neeessa y and interesting
at this timc.

Scieral such courses are now odei»
ed in Grinncll. They should be taken
hy a gienter niiinher or students.

proiossor Bailey’s course in World
Politics. tor example. ‘deals with the
causes oi this war. and studies the
cotitlict campaign by campaign. it
git-es the student a real insight into
the tacts ot the war, what they mean.
what pcace means, and what we are
ﬁghting tor. The second semester of
Protessor Laretl's coui c in Modern
European history otters an oppol‘t‘
pity to study the political and social
conditions which have led up to this
war. However. such courses as these
are by no means the only ones worth
while now. Every study worthy ot a
place in Grinneils curriculum otters
peculiar opportunities at this time.

Adequate military drill demands a
permanent commandant, a regular-
schedule. and some new and varied
--orh. Unitormed companies would
give military training a new dignity
and an added importance.

They are all nece saiy.

.\ FIELD FOR GRIWELL MEN

Gl'tnncll has always heen one ol the
leader. in the teaching or political
science. Belorc many other colleges
and iiiiiiersitics had even begun to
teach the suhicct seriously, Grinnell
had a full schedule ol courses. And
now that the study is recognized by all
universities. Grinncll has one oi the
largest and most complete departe
merits in the United state

For that reason the following par

Protessor naieiiport attended a
