The reason for revolution

Portents of an approaching revolution surfaced at last Wednes-
day’s Joint Board meeting. Members heard a proposal to suspend a
bylaw to allow the immediate consideration of a constitutional ques-
tion. Supporters of the proposal wanted Joint Board to hold a student
referendum calling for a vote of confidence on the constitution of the
student government association. At issue was whether the structure
of student government adequately permitted student involvement.
To be sure, hall presidents and other members of Joint Board ex—
perience little difficulty in voicing their own views while deciding
matters of finance and policy. However, this luxury of political ex-
pression does not extend to all students, Only members of Joint
Board may vote during board meetings, Other students must rely on
the goodwill of their hall presidents to solicit and accurately convey
the student opinion. Yet, a query at last Wednesday’s board meeting
revealed, by show of hands, that many hall presidents never consult
their constituents, This finding should come as no surprise. Student
government at Grinnell is neither democratic nor wholly represen»
tative.

A referendum would enable students to challenge this intolerable
condition, By returning a vote of no confidence, students would ef»
fectively dissolve the existing SGA constitution and open the way for
change. Once this process has begun, all questions aiid proposals
pertaining to the formation of a new student government might best
be resolved through a constitutional convention. At this convention,
students interested in creating a new government could work
together to draft a new constitution which would ultimately go
before the entire student body for ratification.

One constitution, for example, already gaining student support,
aims at making only minor adjustments in the structure of the ex-
isting SGA constitution. It calls for the dissolution of Joint Board and
the elimination of the executive office, but keeps the remainder of
the constitution intact. Furthermore, it seeks to implement a five
member committee which would make all appointments to existing
SGA subcommittees, such as films, concerts, and the political ac-
tivities support fund. However, the new constitution achieves its
revolutionary purpose by embracing democracy. It guarantees that
all matters of concern to students shall be decided at weekly
meetings of the student assembly. Every student in attendance
receives a vote, and all students of the college are welcome to at-
tend. Although the five member committee renders initial opinions,
all decisions are subject to assembly approval. That is to say,
students maintain a veto over all matters brought before the
assembly. In this way, direct participation in student government
replaces the inadequate structure of the current system. Anyone
familiar with town meeting government recognizes the virtues of
this proposal.

The delineation of this democratic system should, by no means,
preclude alternative proposals. By introducing it here, we only
mean to engage discussion. And, if the events at the last Joint Board
meeting serve no great political function, perhaps if nothing else.
they too will encourage students to think. Joint Board's refusal to
suspend the bylaw impedes the revolutionary process only slightly,
for soon comrades of democracy will circulate a petition calling for
a referendum. To sign this petition merely indicates a belief that
students are capable of choosing a government best suited to their
needs. Whatever form this government may take, let it be tempered
in the flames of revolutionary justice, for the wheels of fate have
decided this.

To the Editor: -

At Wednesday’s Joint Board meeting
Jim Glllespie's resolution to limit the
SGA’s power to make political statements
on national issues was defeated. This mo
tion was an attempt to prevent the SGA
from encroaching into an area where it has
neither the right nor the expertise to
operate.

Grinnell College is a place with students
of many varied backgrounds and political
beliefs. To assume that the Hall Presidents
can effectively express the political views
of their entire dorm is completely
ludicrous, However, this is precisely what
the SGA will attempt to do if its power is
not. somehow further defined in this area.
The SGA will attempt to decide student
“consensus” on selected political issues
and make its opinion known in the name of
the entire student body. What the SGA fails
to appreciate is, that in a college where the
student body is as diverse as Grinnell's. no
Opinion will represent all or even likely
most of the students’ views. if the SGA
Wishes to circulate petitions and publish
their results I have no objections.
However, it is an entirely different matter
if the SGA attempts to decide our political
opinions without soliciting our viewpoints.
i regard this as a misuse of power by the
SGA and resent the soils assumption that
it is capable of expressing the political
views of the entire campus community,
especially in light of the [act that the Joint
Board members were not elected as
political representatives but as represen-
latives of student interests,

Although Jim's motion was defeated, i
hope that the SGA will soon tire at its new
ly employed power and concern itself with
the issues that the Grinnell student body
elected it to do. These issues, as laid out by
the SGA Constitution, are those which con»
cern student interests involving or directly
affecting the Grinnell Collegc community,

The Solomon Amendment denies Iederal
financial aid to any student who has not
registered with the Selective Service. One
of the ways that this law is currently enr
forced is that the government sends letters
to those male students who are going to
receive government assistance. This letter
asks them whether they are is years old or
older and if so, whether they have
registered If they have not registered, the
government withholds its aid This law,
therefore, prosccutcs the poor who have
not registered while not prosecuting the
weallliy who are able to finance their own
educations.

The poor in America have always had to
shoulder the burden of war, it has always
been much easier far the wealthy to avoid

Amendment, Congress has not only cone

steps to make this discrimination blatant

Dear Editor,

Somewhat to my chagrin, your “Joint
Board correspondent” erroneously at
tributed a quotation to me in last week‘s
Scarlet and Black. Mr. Schumann's article
regarding last week's SGA meeting quoted
me as agreeing with David Kopelrnan‘s
call for the dissolution of Joint Board. Two
errors were committed.

Firstly, I have never called for die
dissolution of Joint Board. Though Often
prone toward inane debate and incense
quential resolutions, Joint Board does per-
form the Valuable function of allocating
student monies and is therefore a con-
structive body, '

Secondly, I could never have made such
remarks because I did not even attend the
meeting covered by your reporter. [The
sentence in question did pertain to the opi~
nions of ”students attending."] Obviously
capable of sight. Mr. Schumann may have
meant to quote a second opinion from an
outside source and need only plead guilty
to poor writing If such is the case, [do not
expect my private opinions to be mutilated
and then arbitrarily published without my
consent. Please print this letter and we’ll
consider the matter ended e Sincerely.
Wes Joe

an education. The wealthy are not laced
with this dilemma. Because the poor are
denied an education, if their consciences
prevent them from registering, they are
also forced to retain their underprivillged
status because many opportunities which
education would afford them are denied to
them, This amounts to increasing class
stratification and is blatant discrimination
against the lower classes who have no way
of escaping from their position,

Another major problem with the
Solomon Amendment is its ques 'onable

forced to sign a paper testifying that they

Selective Service This mandatory sell in
criiniiiaiion is considered by many to be in
violation of the Fifth Amendment in the
Constitution which states:

Those whose consciences keep them
from registering are laced with a no win
situation Either they must fill out the
fcrm correctly and incriminate
themselves, or they are forced to lie and
possibly be faced with a pemury charge in
the future.
