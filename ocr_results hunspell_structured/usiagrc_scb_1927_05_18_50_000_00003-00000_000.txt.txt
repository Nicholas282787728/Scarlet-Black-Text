~ The Secret

of
Our Success

We do not mind telling the reason
why men who really appreciate ﬁrst
class work are our regular patrons.

Every garment we handle is cleaned
through and through. ‘Not a particle
of soil is left in any part of it. This
requires skill in handling and a gen-
eral use of materials but it is quality
_cleansing, the only kind we will per-
mit ourselves to do. ‘
