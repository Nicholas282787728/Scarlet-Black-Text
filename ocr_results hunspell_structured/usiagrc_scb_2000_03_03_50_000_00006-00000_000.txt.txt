Safe i n town ?
Gn'nneII students report racist and homophobic harassment

By Courtney Sherwood
Editor-in-Chief

At least five times this month
Grinnell students have been vic-
tim to racist or homophobic ha-
rassment while in town. The
most recent incident took place
Monday, Feb. 28, when some-
one wearing what appeared to
be a white Ku Klux Klan hood
pulled up to agroup ofstudents
near the intersection ofSth and
East streets.

The college and the local
community have coordinated a

response for today, which will ,

include speeches and a silent
match. The event will begin at
4:30 pm. at the Central Park
Gazebo, and will include speak-
ers from the college as well as
town leaders. On a campus
where students have been
known to organize rallies and
other shows ofunityin less than
a day, student response to these
incidents has been unusually
slow.

Although President Osgood
issued a statement to the camr
pus condemning the discrimir

natory acts, and the ofﬁce ofse-
curity distributed an email
memo outlining the incidents,
students have not reacted to the
incidents in an organized or
uniﬁed manner. ’

Despite the lack of an orga-
nized response, however, stu—
dents have expressed concern
over the incidents.

“I wanted to go to get some
shampoo, but I’m afraid to go
into rewn," said Jamal Rogers,
an African American studentr

As three ofthe cases ofracist
harassment roolt place soon af-
ter the acquittal ofthe New York
police ofﬁcers who shor’ and
killed unarmed Wesr African
immigrant Amadou Diallo,
some students speculate a con—
nection between these events.
There is no evrdence to confirm
or deny any such link,

In the mean time, the
college’s security department is
working with Grinnell City Po-
lice to find the perpetrators of
the harassment. The police may
have suspects for two ofrhe in»
cidents, artd they have asked
students to contact campus ser

curity ifa Ford Mustang, possiv
bly a convertible, is seen on
campus.

The security department has
issued a statement regarding
student safety. “If you are ha<
rassed by someone in a vehicle,

 

try to remember the license
number and a description ofthe
vehicle,” the statement reads.
uReport this information to the
security department as soon as
possible. If you’re out walking
at night and fear for your safety

please contact the Security
Department’s Escort Service.
The Security Department will
escort studenm anywhere within
the city limits of Grinnell. Al-
ways try to walk in well lit areas
and walk in pairs when possible.
