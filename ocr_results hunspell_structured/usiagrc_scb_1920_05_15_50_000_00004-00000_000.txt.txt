As an example of What the united

conspicuous and encouraging. This
organization came into being seven
years ago, in response to an appeal
from the college to take the burden or

THREE GUNGEHTS BY

One of Nation‘s Foremost Music
Organizations — Oberhoffer
Is Conductor.

The Minneapolis symphony Orchesr
tra, which is to give three concerts in
Grinnell during the May Festival, was
established about twenty years ago by
a group of publicrspii-itcd cit ous of
Minneapolis who wanted to see their
city assume a position of leadership
in music comparable to its position
in ﬁnance, commerce, and industry.
Like all such ventures it required a

great deal or laitli, and a lavish rxneu—l

diturc of money without hope of ma-
tcrial return during the ﬁrst years oi
its existence, and there we a good
many, even in Minneapolis itself. to
say nothing of st. Paul, who predicted
that a permanent orchestra of high
i-anlg could never be established in
that c . But the complete success
which has marked Lhe career of this
orchestra has entirely vindicated the
judgment of its founders. During the
many troubles of the last tew yeal’si
musical. ﬁnancial and temperamental
iwhich have caused many long estab-
lished orchestras to deteriorate. and

quite a few to be abandoned entirely,
llot‘

the Minneapolis Orchestra has
only maintained its integlit but ho
made remarkable s ides in pertecliun
and personnel.

Hus Special [’1‘

The Orchestra as it will appear in
Griuncll is organized as tollows: eight
ﬁrst violins, six second \inlins, [our
violas, four violuuccllos. four double
bass vinls, all these together forming
the string section. The wood-Winds
contain three flutes, one piccolo, two
uboes. two clarinets, one bass clarinet,
and tin-cc bassccus. The brass section
contains ﬁve French horns, three
trumpets, tlll'eetl‘olllbones,alld a tuba.
In addition to these there are special
players for harp. tympaui, and percus-
sion, such as gloclieuspicl, bells, tri-
angle, cymbals, tnmetolll, snare and
bass drum. etc. The concertmastcr,
Glly Woodard. the principal Violon—
cello, Her-luau Beyer-Plane, tile harp»
i , Henry J. Linden, and several othr
el's, will be heard in special solo and
obligate numbers. '

The eminent conductor of tile on
chestra. Emil Obevboffeu, is well
known in Gl'innell through the previ-
ous appearances of this organization

'5 unique genius, his modesty and
perseverance. and his faithfulness and
loyalty at all times, have brought him
into the very ﬁrst rank ot American
conductors, and the success of the
orchestra is directly due to his sw
pi-eme ability and tact.

The Orchestra will appear at three
concerts of the May Festival. suuday
afternoon, May 23 aud Monday after-
noon and evening, lliay 24.
