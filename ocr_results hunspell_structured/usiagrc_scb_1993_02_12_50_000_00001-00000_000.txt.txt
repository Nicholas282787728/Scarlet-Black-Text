mittee. “We have a little bit more lined up.“

billing last semester.

. “It was abysmal," said sophomore Ben Howe. “Were there any
concerts last semester?”

“There was nothing worth going Io," said senior Holiday Collins. “It
was lame, lacking compared to previous years,” junior Alan l-Ianley said.

Students React to News

“It’s nothing that we could have
predicted,” saidRobcrta Atwell, pro-
fessor of Miller’s Human Relations
in Educationclass, which met shortly
after the announcement. Students in
the class also expressed surprise at
Miller‘s suicide.

JuniorMarkPatlon Said,“llived
in her hall and she was always really
friendly,” Patton told the class that
when Miller was reported missing on
Monday night, “everyone assumed

that she had been abducted“.

“She fooled her roommates. She
fooled everybody. She made a deci-
sion, she had a plan and she carried it
out."

“I think that sometimes an at—
tempted suicide is a cry for help."
Atwcll said. “She may also have
known the college well enough to
know that if you give any indication
that you‘re thinking of something
like this that we‘ll try to stop you....
One has to assume that in this case it
wasn‘t a cry for help"

Class members agreed that indi-
viduals will have different ways of
dealing with grief. “We have to make
sure that we're doing for ourselves
what’s right,” said junior Gareth
Fisher.

Sophomore I im Hall concurred,
saying, “We have to bereally careful
that we don‘t enforce our ways of
dealing with it onto others."

“Sometimes you might have to
just listen," said freshman Dan Tix.

Atwell said that it is imponant to
“be up front with your feelings, but
calm enough notto contributeto hys-
teriam '

“I drink if you‘re having trouble
dealing with this, certainly talking to
counselors is important,“ Atwell rec-
ommended.
