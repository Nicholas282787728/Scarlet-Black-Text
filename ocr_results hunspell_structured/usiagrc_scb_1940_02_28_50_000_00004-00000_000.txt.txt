$23 is Collected
For Finn Reliel
A+ Cage Game

Over 523 was contributed to the
Finnish Relief fund by persons
attending the Grinnell-Drake has-
ketball game Monday night.

Boxes were placed at the three
entrances to the gymnasium in
which contributions could be
dropped.

“It was very gratifying," said
Coach John c. Truesdale, “to
realize the amount of the dona-
tions. Compared with the $5 or
so that was donated last year for
the infantile paralysis fund, this
represents a feeling of generosity
toward a worthy cause.”
