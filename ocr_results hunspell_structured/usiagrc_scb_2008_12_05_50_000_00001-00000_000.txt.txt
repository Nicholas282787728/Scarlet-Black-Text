on current state
of the College

Isv DAVID Loci-IN

Between Dec 1 and 3, reporters and editors
for the SH}? distributed surveys to 73 randomc
1y selected Grinnell College students to gauge
their opinion about a number of topics import
(ant to the Grinnell community. Questions
covered issues ranging from mental health and
substance use to SGA and the $658.

The survey responses painted the picture
ota snrdent body that Is pleased with its edue
cation, potentially overworked, moderately
worried about substance, and one which has a
very high opinion ofitself.

Students were generally positive or the ad-
ministration, With 63 percent saying that "tlic
administiation cares about [their] concerns.”

Despite recervrng relatively high overall
marks, some admrnistrators expressed disap-
pointment over smdenttﬂdministrator tee
lations. Vice President for Student Affairs
Houston Dougharty said that, or” the other
colleges and universities at which he has
worked, Grinnell has students least trusting of
the administrators

“1 was actually surpriscd," Dotrgharty said.
“At every other school where rye been a clean,
that kind or question gets between so and 90
percent approval rating. And here, it's much
lower."

And though respondents were gener-
ally positive about the administration, older
students were far more negative,rhan their
younger counterparts. Whilc 75 percent of
rrrst year respondents agreed that “the admin-
istration cares about [their] concerns," only
23 percent orseniors did so. Seniors were also

more negative than other students on RLCs
and the College’s seltegovcrnance policy.

Dougharty said that, at most institutions,
some degree of dropeort among seniors rs to
be expected. “I think that ﬁrst years are always
going to be a little more optimistic, and a lit-
tle more naive and a little less jaded," he said.
“But also one ofthe things that we teach here
is critical thinking and how to question, so
that’s bound to have some impact on [student
opinions]?

Jayseii Wright '09, who said he has direct
experience with members or the administra-
tion, said his mistrust is a product of more
than simple critical thinking skills.“l say, yeah,
my trust has gone down because, at ﬁlst, one
of the things that attracted me to Grinnell was
just the rdea or open communication between
students and administration but really it‘s
like they listen to us and then do whatever
they want."

assistant treasurer typicallya junior, serves un»
dcr the SGA treasurer for an initial full year
and is promoted to treasurer the following acat
demic year.

tcr off. “It was probably the hardest decision
I've made, but sometimes you have to pick

avoid that for a while, but it's the healthiest
decision {or me.”
