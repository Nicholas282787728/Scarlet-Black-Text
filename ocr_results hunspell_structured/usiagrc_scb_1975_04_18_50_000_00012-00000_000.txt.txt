Craig Zippe limited a strong
William Penn crew to eight hits
and three runs, two unearned, but
Grinnell remained wmless after
five contests, losing 3-0 Wednesday
at North Field. William Penn,
which has played the likes oi
University of Arkansas and shorts
a c2 record, rode the wave oi
strong pitching and solid hitting to
win after being shutout in the early
stages.

Thirteen strikeouts hurl the
Pioneer diamondmen, allowing the
faulty Statesman defense to take it
easy The only two batters
avoiding the strikout spell, Paul
Delaney and Chris Edwards,
collected the only two hits for the
home team. Grinnell threatened
only in the third, when an error, a
balk, and a base on balls put a pair
of Grinnell runners on board. The
rally died, however, when John
Haigh’s fly to deep right was
gathered in despite the tortuous
wind sweeping across the
diamond.

Also played Wednesday was a
junior varsity match-up with Penn.
Grinnell floundered late in the
game to lose 10-1, yielding a full

The Pioneers fared no better in
their road encounters at Coe and
Cornell earlier last week. The Coe
doubleheader saw fine pitching
from Zippe and the Cornell action
spurred Haigh into team batting
leadership with a periect three ior
three game, but all to naught as the
games were consistently resolved
by lopsided scores with Grinnell at
the losing end.

“The team can do much better,”
assured four-year veteran Mark
Hanisch after the Penn loss.
“We’ve shown signs of im-
provement all along. The team is
playing more as a unit now,
showing composure.”

Although concerned somewhat
over the lack of hitting in the
Wednesday contest, l-lanisch
remained optimistic, commenting
that the “hitting has been imr
proving and should be better in the
future."

Netmen ripooned, 5-4

by John Loni

In what can be best described as
an epitome oi irustration, the
Grinnell tennis team dropped its
home opener Friday aiternoon to
Ripon College by a one point
margin, 5-4. With a «172 lead after
the singles competition, it seemed
that the Pioneers were on their
way to one of their more im»
pressive victories in years.

Leading the Pioneers in the
singles play was sophomore Dan
Edwards, who fought back to

Position to Hoth

by Tim DeCoster

Sandra Hoth, associate professor
oi physical education and Grinnell
field hockey coach, has been

elected president of the Iowa
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women. Hoth
replaces current IAIAW president
Peg Burke of the University of
Iowa, who has just been elected

'president of the National AXAW.

Both will assume her duties in
June. The term includes three
years on the executive board, two
years as president, and one year as
“past president.”

Hoth has served as Grinnell’s
representative to the delegate
assembly since the formation of
the IAIAW In 1971. She has served
on the Ethics and Eligibility
Committee and currently chairs
the Constitution and Bylaws
Committee, which has just com-
pleted the final draft of the first
oiiicial Constitution, approved by
the delegate assembly on April 1,
1975. As president she will also

serve on the budget Committee of
the Iowa Region IV IAIAW. Her
other duties will include presiding
at meetings, coordinating and
interpreting all activities, in»
cluding news releases and rulings
on appeals of decisions oi the lower
Ethics and Eligibility Committees.

She feels that this is a “very
interesting time to be involved in
women’s athletics” and believes
publicity is very important.
Previously coverage of women's
athletics in major news sources
has been minute, but part of Hoth’s
job is to “make the public aware"
that this is a “very alive lime in
women's sports." She must see
that the whole idea behind
women’s sports get off on the right
foot.

Hoth was elected to the position
after being drafted for the
nomination at the suggestion of
outgoing president, Burke. Her
replacement for representative
will be named later by Athletic
Director John Ptitsch.

winning the event, and con-
sequently emerging as the ”team

fcrence, were the Fighting Scots
from Monmouth with a slender 2097
team effort.

The “Bower-y Boys” trailed
Monmouth, Central, and William

the Pioneers may be comiorted by
the presence of tour more teams

the face of the on»rushing Ripon
wave. The doubles teams of Bob
RosemRick Kellar, Edwards-
Newton, and Bloom-Silverberg
showed occasional flashes of fine
tennis prowess, but not con-
sistently enough to withstand the
disciplined Ripon team.

On Tuesday the Pioneers tried to
get their “act" together, but unr
fortunately had to play a very fine
UNI team. Besides relishing their
first outdoor match, the Pioneers
could dolittle else. Though the UNI
team did not look as impressive as
everyone had previously believed,
they did a more than adequate job
in sending the Pioneers to an early
dinner. Besides the Newton singles
and Bloom~Silverberg doubles
matches none of the Pioneers came
close to victory. By dinner time it
was UNI 9, Grinnell 0.

It still is too early in the season to
properly evaluate the Pioneers,
but one certainty is that they
possess at least one significant
quality: potential. Once this
potential is reached, the now
passive Grinnell lobbers will
surely become the terrors of Iowa.
This weekend against Knox and
Monmouth the Pioneers could just
achieve their potential.
