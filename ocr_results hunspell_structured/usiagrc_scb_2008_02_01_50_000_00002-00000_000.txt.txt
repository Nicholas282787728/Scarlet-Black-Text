College undergoing reaccredidation

BY Sven Friar [AN

A crack team ofacademics is on their way to Grinnell Cole
lege very soon to assess whether Grinnellians are getting the
education they were told they would be getting in all the college
brochures and promotional media,

This fall, the Higher Learning commission of the North
Central Association ofCollcgcs and Schools (NCA) will he ran
viewing Grinnell College as part ofa teaccrcdidation process to
ensure that crinnell still maintains high standards oflearning
and merits membership in the associations While Grinncll is
almost certain ofpassrag the process, the results itnpacr other
aspects such as the ability to attract faculty and secure federal
funding

Every ten years, the college is subject to this review and as
part ofthe process, sets up a committee to complete a selfestudy
on the state ofthe collegeThis review is then presented to the
reviewers with the NCA who use it as part of their assessment.

Typically. it college must demonstrate adherence to a numt
ber of speciﬁc criteria laid out by the HLC which review the
school's teaching quality. financial stability, and student servrce,
among others.Thrs time, though, Grirrncll was given broad lati-
tude in conducting its own review,

This year’s committee is headed by Henry Rietz ‘89, Reli-
gious studies. According to Rietz, the college obtained permis-
sion to do a special emphasis study. “So rather than spend the
majority of our time reﬂecting on those criteria to look at a
particular aspect ofwhar we're doing and ask the question are
there ways we can do it better." he said.

The particular aspect examined by the study is “how can we
reinvigorate our traditional commitment to creating leaders for
social justice" said Dr. Rico.

To answer this question the committee is distributing sur—

vcys to staff members and faculty on the state of Gtinnell’s
progress towards the goal of social justice. Additionally, over a

. thousand graduates from the last 10 years will receive surveys

asking whether they see themselves as leaders working towards
the public good and how Grinnell has affected them in their '
lives. Current sophomore, juniors and seniors are also being
asked for their opinion as to whether Grinnell’s education has
affected them in a positive way or not.

According to Jen Kohn, who also serves on the committee,
more student particrpatron would provide a better reflection on
the opinions ofthe current student body, bur the student return
rate thus farts a poor 12 percent.

The Higher Learning commission, which is an ilidcpcii»
dent corporation and is one of the six regional institutional
accredrtors, wrll often dispatch review teams of established in-
drvrduals in college education. “It’s usually another college prose
rdent, usually a dean, sometimes a finance otrrcer, usually the
head ofstudent affairs and other people who are familiar with
the workings ofa higher educarional institute," said Grinncll
College President Russell K. Osgood, Grinncll,

This review team will be visiting the campus sometime in
September 2003 to interview members of the college and er
amine the institutions frnances. Both the review team’s frndings
and the self-study by Grinnell will be available to the general
public in some form or the other according to Dr. Rietz.

While Osgood himself acknowledges that the chances of
Grinnell being denied reatcredrtatron is virtually nonexistent,
gelling accreditation is important in academic circles. The re-
sults of reaccredidation processes can often affect professors’
willingness to teach there, as well as the amount of federal
funding received, both of which are essential to the college's
future.

speech to the trustees before last
semester, Osgood presented the
reduction of student borrowing and debr as his primary buds
getary goal for the year “My view is I would like every college
student in the United States to graduate without any loans,"
he said.

“My father paid for everytlrrng and I graduated without any
loans,” Osgood said. “[The trustees and I] thought students
shouldn’t be burdened by [loans] when making future docit
srons ,

than some schools of equal caliber," she said. “But I feel like
with the endowment and the amount of money they have, they
could be more generous,"

Erin Higgins '09 said that the debt she accumulates while
in college may inﬂuence her career decisions. “I'm not that cxe
perienced with frnancral aid but it seems that I personally have
a number ofloans,” she sard. “And I do have scholarships and

grants but [the loans] will affect what I have to do in the funnc
rn terms ofpaying them off.”

In the past year colleges such as Williams College and Mid
dlebury College announced similar loan—reduction programs,
Osgood sard that Grinncll began crafting its policy years ago
and that it is not a response to these or other announcements.
“We do ed to go down this road before we even heard of
those policies," he said. “We're not doing , in response to what
othcr institutions are doing,vvc're doing it because it’s the right
thing to do."

Bishop sard that while Grinnell’s frve-part plan might not
be as “sexy as Williams‘s," which categorically eliminates loans
from need-based aid, it will have the same longeterm effect of
effectively eliminating student loans upon graduation.

Scott saw the issue of ﬁnancial itid as a means for the col-
lege to fulfrll its commitment so social responsibility. “I feel like
their supposed commitment to socral justice should include en-
couragrng students from communities and families that might
not otherwise go to college to go,"shc said.
