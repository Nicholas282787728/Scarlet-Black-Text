tormation, has conrused some and
been ignored by many.

lst Annual Titular Head of the
Relays Contest.

0 The Contest. originally patterned

nostalgic return to the days oi the
Homecoming Queen.

prior to the Relays, will take place
in the Pub.

vertible in the opening procession

Two nationally known novelists,
Hortense Callsher and Curtis
iiarnack, will be on campus next
week (or the annual Writers’
Conference.

Harnaok is currently director of
Yaddo, the foundation {or the arts
at Saratoga Springs, NY. He
graduated from Grinnell in 19'“?
and taught here in 1952-53, His
novels, The Work 01 An Ancient
Hand and Love and Be Silent, set
the joys and sorrows or rural
Iowans against the great, im-
personal movements oi the earth
and the seasons:

Just when lawns began to
turn green again and there was
a stir of life and activity,
suggestive of all that was to
come, despairing old timers
threw ropes around their
necks. To a city person the
bleakest time of the year is
dead Winter, but to these
country people there was no
period more terrible than the
surge of life at the beginning of
spring. No season more clearly
foretold the end, and all of the
years of green earth to come
after each man’s time,

(The Work of an Ancient Hand!

Harnack remains detached
enough from his characters to
show us the whole pattern of their
lives, but he never loses com-
passion tor them. His works leave
us feeling deeply moved. but calm.

Hortense Calisher, according to
a reviewer in Nation, “carries
lorward the Jamesian tradition of
rococco writing iiligreed over hair-
splitting thought". She is a native
of New York, and her external
settings are urban, but most of the
action in her novels occurs in the
“Submerged territory" of her
characters’ minds.

Calisher seems less concerned
than Harnack with aesthetic
distance. In her recent
autobiographical essay, Herseli,
she writes, “My book is my blood,"
and praises the writer ”who
carries the extra weight of his own
failibility in the presence of
mystery, and will never concede
that any subject in human life is
donor"

Both writers will appear at a
colloquium in the South Lounge at
4:15. Tuesday, April 22. They will
read their work in Herrick Chapel
on Wednesday, April 23, at 8 pm.
Recent works by Calishe!‘ and
Harnack are available in the
college bookstore,

A DeCade of Dancing

by Katy nuny

“It’s good exercise, a great way to learn
about difierent cultures, and it's fun,” says
Carolyn Katzen about [01k dancing. The
Grinnell Folk Dancers have been an active
member of the college community for ten
years. Katzen‘s attitudes helps explain why.

The group started under the direction of
Mrs, Pirkko Roecker. Under Roecker, the
folk dancers became the largest
organization on campus, due mainly to her
enthusiasm and charisma. FoiloWing
Roecker’s departure two years ago,
students assumed the leadership Donna
Meck now serves as laculty advisur, but
students teach the classes.

The group consists of iorty members,
about 50 per cent of whom are new to folk

dancing. The 2:) ratio of women to men is
”almost good" according to President Rod
McVeigh,

The group does not perform the
traditional dances irom around the world,
tor they tend to be very simple and
monotonous. instead, traditional steps are
re-worked to make the dances more fun to
perform and watch

Costumes are an important part of the
performance. A good deal of time is devoted
to the research and sewing of the costumes.
Each dancer is responsible [or making his
or her costume. For every dance, the
dancers wear costumes characteristic oi the
country from which the dance originates.

The 10th Annual Folk Dance Concert will
be held this Friday and Saturday night at
8:00 pm in Darby.
