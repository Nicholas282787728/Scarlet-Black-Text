North Korea two nuclear reactors
(which they had been offered long
before, butwhichhad beenrevoked),
and they accepted. “Jimmy carrer

Dr, Fetter's final note was that
the US government is not followtng
through on this deal energetically
enough. They made the agreement
and are now not implementing it.
This could provoke Norrli Korea to

A'VIEW FROM CONGRESS

The fourth speaker, Dr. Randy
Rydell, is astaffmember forthe Sen<

(airs. He has taught ar Princeton in
rhe pasr and served as a polirieal
analysr for Lawrence Liyermore Na—
tional Laboratory.

or. Rytlellexplainedwhatour
congresspeople are thinking abour
with regard to nuclear weapons. To
preraee, lie nored that nuclear prolit
eration is not a basic issue in cont
gress: None or the members is roo
worried abour proliremrion of nude
arweapons. Bui when you ask them,
there are two basic (conﬂicting) ide«
ologtes: rirsr, we can and should stop
nuclear proliferation; second, we

The first camp concentrates
onlhemethodscountriesmightpup

believe in export controls and the

to these oounrries, all ofwhom have
had nuclear weapons programs, were
approved.

Although South Africa has
abandoned their program and Iraq is
under sanctions, the Clinton admin—
istration has given even more lee—
way to companies which export dual
use technologies, ivith 99.9% of ex—
ports approved. regardless of destina—
tion.

The second eamp feels rliar
trying to control the spread ofnucle
ar weapons is useless. They support
stat irarsrype programs to defend
against possible nuclear attack and
offensivebomhlngcampaignsllt‘mn-
allies obtain nuclear weapons. They
oppose espari controls They nore
that the IAEA has no real enforce—
ment mechanism, but they don‘t
worry about it.

ton(despite rhetoric to the contrary)
is promoting exports to any nation
which will buy, and lie is promoting

adVice ofthe anti—proliferationcamp.

Dr. Rydell ended balefully by
pointing out that nuclear bombs are
small and can be easily made in less
than a week. There are thousands of
tonsofhighlyeunched uranium float—
ing around, and the congressional
myopia on export safeguards could
be disastrous. There is no more so»
lienr issue in rhe world roday, he
posited.

NUKES IN THE USSR

Dr. Potter offered a rweriiig

He went on to say that he
thinks an even bigger problem is ba—
sicsafety, both with regard to nuclear
power and nuclear weapons. The
former SoViet states have ambitious
plans (or reaerors (nuclEat energy).
and theUShas agreed to assistthem.
The biggest problems are fourfold:
first, there are serious resource con—
straints: supply for routine mainte—
nance is a problem, because poyerry
is so Widespread (parts are often bar«
tered aivay for necessities like sugar
or ﬂour).

specialists can earn ten times their
salary by moving to Russia. The besr
people leave, and nuclear reactors
are left in the hands of mediocre (at
best) caretakers.

All of these problems are
present in the military sector as well.
Dr. Potter told us that there are de—
commissioned submarines wiili large
quantities of highly enriched urani—
umwhich are barelyguarded, if guard—

bad economics and bad government.
and the problems are not likely to be
