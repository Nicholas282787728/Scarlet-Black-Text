Douglas Coldshoulders—

Flulher ls His Name

Mystery is fast surrounding
Fluther, the worryhird who has
attached himself to Coach Ben
Douglas staff as special assist—
ant coach in charge of worrying.

Flutller started his career in-
-nocently, arriving last week, a
present from Marty O’Connor,
esssitant coach last year, and
now serving in the army air
Corps,

, The pessimistic bird immediate
ly went to Work from the top
of the coach's desk in the new
gym, with neither name nor mys-
tery.

Both arrived Thursday, when
Douglns’ announcement that he
had named the bird Fluther, and
his immediate refusal to explain
the origin of the term.

Even G. Lester Duke, office
mate of the coach, doesn’t know
where the name came from.

In an effort to get to the bot-
tom of the mystery, Duke took
_§‘lul_her to the pep rally, Flulher’s
first, Thursday night.

The bird, who hides a sterling
character and a heart of gold
beneath its brilliant green plu-
mage, was properly modest. and
declined to say a word.

The villain of the rally was
Douglas, who broke off a most
‘promising friendship when he
turned 2 cold shoulders on
Fluther.

Fiutlier was reported very
much hurt, and almost in tears
‘at the affront.

He is hearing up bravely, nev-
ertheless, and doing his full stint
of worrying.

Part of the insult consisted in
Douglas' refusal to explain
Fluther's name to the student
body, since Fluther himself
doesn't know where the name
came from, although he is inten-
sely curious.

Campus busybodies were re<
strained late last night from de-
manding an apology from Doug—
las on behalf of Fluther, and
the “better elements” of the
student body are hoping that the
‘coach will soon take matters ins
to his own hands with a full apol-
ogy and explanation

Conias Works Frosh
Hard On Blocking

The freshman grid squad. now
numbering 15 stiff and lame
jointed preps has been working
out regularly under the direction
of assistant coach Louie Gonies,
head coach Ben Douglas said to-
day.

Practice has been centered
mostly on fundamentals, blocking,
charging. and tackling, he said.

Since freshmen are eligible to
play in the three nonvconference
games, it is possible that Walt
Burns, Kermit Stienbcck and
possibly other freshmen will see
service With the varsity during
the season,

Burns, a second semester fresh-
men is a promising back with
an outstanding passing arm while
sticnbeck received allrstate rating
for his play on the IRichland, 1a.,
high school team last year.

The Grinnell college band will

The band’will begin perform-

no marching will be done,

“Marching band cannot be con-

every musical organization,u
Simmons explained.

After conferring together, the
music and athletic departments
have agreed that instead of hav-
ing an inadequate band on the
field, it will be much more ef»

Simmons said that, although
