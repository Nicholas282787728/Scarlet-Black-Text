With technology, Bridgman/ Packer dance with themselves

Bv Tessa Cl |EEK

Watching Art Bridgman and Myrna Pack-
ers work is a littl a like taking druus. The music
is loud, the lights are off and theb audience ber
gins to make out shapes in the dark. When the
lights come up, the unique quality ofBi'idgr
man and Packei’s three-pair collaboration,
performed Wednesday night in But-ksbaum,
hits full force.

The dancing centers on the play of real
llesh and projected images which Bridgman
and Packet use to represent the quest {at an»
tonomoiis and shared identity.

Packer danced solo in front ofwhitc scicens
that dominate the production
As she moved, her , rage was
reﬂected, tinted, mirrored and
duplicated across the screen.
She is a living thing caught
in a kaleidoscope and litelally
dancing with herself

When they do ﬁnd each
other, the strength of Bridge
man and Packer’s collabora-
tion is instantly apparent.
Towards the end of the ﬁist
piece, Seductive Reasoning ,
the pair performed a series ofconiplex lifts her
hind a sheet of gauze as surreal images p d
acloss their faintly lit dual form. The audi-
ence is palpably mesmerized, the pair is like
an imagined dieain, so distant and lovely even
gravity cannot touch it,

Although Bridgman and Packer have been
working together for 30 years, only in the last
six or seven have they begun to blend video
imagery with their movement, eieating the vi-
sually dazzling style that has come to detine
their work

“We realized that [working with video
technology] was an instant metaphor for are

ploring the issues ot identity, because we e
working with our own images, and intil icy,
because we re working with not only each otha
cr but each othei’s images,"Packei said.

The question of identity is immediately
clear, and reinforced when the life like screened
images of Bridgman and Packer perform
alongside the danceis then ves.The illusion
sends shivers down your spine and keeps you
guessing for the remainder ofihc piece.

“We raise that whole question ofwho are
you are really relating to," Pa said, “The
person who's right in front ofyoiir or your iinr
age of that person. And also the basic concept

ot’pereeprion, what is real and

what native play with aiidie
ptlcepilon, and there
are times when w are pure
posefully creating that confur
sion."

Beneath the neat magic-
trick quality oi the production,
dgman and Pucker are also
gifted and pretise dancers.

“We’ve worked with a
numbei of diflcreiit contem-
poniry styles," Bridgman said.
“So we consider ourselves rather ccletic," The
duo confirmed this with a piece that included
broken contemporary lines, impressive athletic
lifts and even a splash oflvhat looks like tango
or swing.

Throughout their movements, filmed oi
otherwise. the trust and partnership between
Bridgman and Packcr' is compelling, cvcn ass
tonishina

“The partnering, both its athleticism and
sensuality... encompasses the larger vision,"
Packer said.

The audience watches Bridgman and
Packer search for themselves, their images

However, Bridgman and Backer will have
a very real presence at the college tor the next
couple ofweeks. on Tuesday they ran a parked
audition for a piece set irp with students that
will show in the spring.

upturned mattress, to a sequence in which
Bridgman anti Packer were dressed in white
skirts whilc images of various outfits turned
them into tcchno future paper dolls

ln search of laughs and deeper mennina ,
Bridgman and Packer make the most ofmod-

and raise new questions.The trilogy gets under
the audience's skin, leaving us wondering what
the future of this more modern than modern

What would you sayis the essential mes
sage efGrtreiiow's work?

1 think the essential message is to care
deeply, be connected to, know, and under-
stand oiir natuial enviionment and columns
niry. Also, be concerned not only about the
beautiful things but be concerned about the
negative things and take responsibility for the
ways that we ale actually destroying the natu-
ral world as well as our own communities.

How did you ﬁnd Paul Gtuchow and
how did he come to be an influence on your
work?

I had never heard of Gruchow until I had my first teach
ing job. One semester I was assigned to teach contemporary
literature, which could mean anything, so I took a thematic apr
proach. l was really starting to develop my interest in nature
and midwesrern writing.

I happened upon an anthology of midwestern tum] writ
ing, and there was an essay by Gruchow in there. It was one
of the winter essays offamimlofa Prairie Yam. As I discovered
his work, I just became more and more interested. He was a

tremendous oral reader He was one ofthe best readers I re ever
heard, to was doing a reading at a rural writers festival and I
just became enthralled by him in person.

How do you see community as part ofplace and part ofa
writer's perspective oftlie world?

1 think that a lot of times people may see those as differ
cut or separate. You're a nature writer or you're a writer who's
interested in the social aspect ofthings. But I think they're very
much interrelated and l tllink those are the ripe oteonnecrions

that Paul Gruchow is trying to make.

On the one hand, part of' it is showinv the
ways in which living with the namial world, in
the natural world, and taking care of the natu-
ral world is something that is important to the
ways that we interact as a community. I also
think there’s a metaphoric way you can look
at community in the natural world But, in a
lot of ways, the interrelationships that form a
good community and the positive and interac-
tive relationships are ecological. We now know,

, certainly in the last 30, 40 years as the cnvirorr
rncnml movement took off, that we need to be
concerned about ecosystems and biodiversity

[along with] the interactions and interrelationships.

Animals, plants. streams, and everything else don’t work
and operate in isolation but are a part ofa greater whole. And
that's how communities work, too.\Ve :iren'tjust individualistic
atoms moving off in our own independent directions. When
we forget our interrelationships, that’s when the community
falls apartjust as when we sever the relationships in the natural
world, that's how ecosystems fall apart.
