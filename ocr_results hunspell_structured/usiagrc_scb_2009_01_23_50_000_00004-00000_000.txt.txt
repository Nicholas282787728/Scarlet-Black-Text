“saints ofliberalisrn," which includes a bust ofJFK.

Throughout the show, Gogerry is animated, able to convey

Beauty and
the Beast
(7997)

Emmy {mt/1}]: Emir 1s 1 true gem of 1 film, layering fresh
and v1br1nr characters on top of that wonderfully timeless duals
iry that is essent11l to t1iry tales. There's 1 true sense of rn1g1cal
wonder that lingers after the frlm is over—the songs, rhe energy
ofthe screenplay, and the warmth of the story allow it to remain
unique and memorable.

Most of us know the story: as punishment tor denyrng her
shelter from the bitter cold, an enchantress transforms a prince
into a “hideous" (but kind of endearing) beast. If he is able
to love another and earn their love in return before his let
birthday, the spell that transformed him into the beast and his
staff into useful and adorable household objects,ivill be broken.
Sure, sure: its a tall order to find one’s true love by the time
youro 21 Ivc sure as hell failed—but we buy wholeheartedly
into the story because its a fairytale after all.

At the storys center is the strong wrlled and deeply com—
passionate Belle, 1 girl who is thought of as “odd" by the rest of
the town (she's always reading! and thinking for hcrselfll). We
know Bcllc 1s 1 romantic, unwilling to settle for the stutily yct
nurcissistically bland Gaston, who goes around town in Skll‘r
tight pants and some pretty ostentatious bouts, She dreams
of adventure “in thc great wide somewhere," and damn it, we
share that dream.

When she becomes 1 prisoner or the Beast to save her fan
thcr, we feel for l)()[l\ oftlrosc ch tcrs, and long (or their “m,

Making marching bands cool again

All or Gmdner Lounge will become 1 st1ge Friday night
with the return ofChicago’s Mucca Pazza to Grinncll. The
self-described “circus punk marching band" consists of 30
pertormers who rock out on everything from the accordion
to the violin to the sous1phone. Oh, 111d they bring cheer-
leaders.

Donned in an impressive vatrery of marching band
uniforms, the members spread themselves throughout the
room to create a totally irninersive, chaotic, and unique con~

to mirror their 2006 performance here by marching around

mostly makes you wonder why more marching bands don't
