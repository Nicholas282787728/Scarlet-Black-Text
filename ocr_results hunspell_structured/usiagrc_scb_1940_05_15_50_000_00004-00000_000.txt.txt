Coe Freshmen
Win Prep Meet
In Final Checkup

By Jack Wile.

Coe squeezed out victories
Saturday in both the varsity
and freshman divisions of the

triangular track and field
meet with Cornell and Grinncll
on Ward field. The varsity ac<
cumulated 67 points over the
Pioneers' 62 and the fi-osh amasA
sed a total of 541/2 points over the
Pioneer preps' 59. Cornell finished
third in both of the meets.
Reverse Decisions.

Despite the fact that earlier
accounts gave the Grinnell fresh-
men the meet by one and one-
half points. a later check in the
score turned the favor to Goa and
dropped Grinnell to second place.

In the varsity meet, five rec-
ords were broken and one tied
with Harry Barker of Grinnell
carrying away marks in both the
javelin and discus events.

Moon Wins Dashes,

Another Pioneer man, John
Moon, came from behind in the
last strides of the 100 and 200<
yard dashes to add two more
firsts to Grinnell's score. Jack
Keehn, Grinnell, leaped 21 feet
3 inches in the broad jump for
a new record in that event.

Thn'ilers of the day were the
two-mile run. in which Roy Mc-
Cauley of Cornell defeated Bill
Davis of Cue, and the mile relay,
the race that decided the winner
of the meet.-, Cornell came from
behind in the last quarter to will
first place and Coe nosed out
Grinnell for second place and the
championship.

\‘Vebb Smashes Two Marks.

The preps had a big day as they
set records in 11 of the 15 events.
Fred Webb, Grinnell, smashed the
old marks in the broad jump and
the 220-ydrd 10W hurdles; and
two more Grinnell men, Ken Mc-
Callum and Bob Corrigan, esta-
blished new marks in the nil-yard
dash and the 120<yard low hurdles,
respectively.

All three of these schools will
be back in competition again Sat-
urday in the conference meet at
Galeshurg, Ill. Coe won the con-
ference championship last year
With Carleton and Beloit placing
second and third.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Grinncll’s Chances Look Good.
G. Lester Duke, Pioneer track
mentor, said yesterday, that if
the squad shows the same scrap
and improvement that they had in
last Saturday’s meet, Grillnell has
a good chance to wm the meet.
This year's race for the cham-
pionship should be much closer.
with Grinnell, Coe and Beloit rated
the top favorites. Monmouth’s
trackmcn may be clicking this
time, too, and will be another
team to heat. Beloit's strength
comes from last year's freshman
squad, who won the prep confer-
ence telegraph meet with twice as
many points as the second place
winner, Cue.
Returning Champions Listed.

Returning conference champs
include Hartman, Belo‘lt, who turn-
cd in a 4:213 mile last year;
Jones from Lawrence with a heave
of 47 feet in the shot~put at this
year’s Beloit relays; Swanson,
Knox, who threw the javelin 154
feet last year; and Cornell’s dis-
tance runner, McCauley, in the
[Wormlle run.

Walter Klnch, coe hurdler, and
Barker, Grinnell weight man, can
be counted on for good perfor—
mances in Saturday’s meet.

Al Galesburg, 111.

Pioneer tennis players dropped

when they wele defeated Saturday
on the local courts hy coe. Grin-
ncil came out on the small end of
a 4 to 2 count.

In the singles, crinneli netsteis
held their own, Salvage and Oct-
jen defeating their opponents and
Peisner and Beisenstein falling
short. Coe’s clean sweep of the
douhles made up the winning mar-
gm.

The next match for Grinnell will
be Saturday at Galesburg. Ill, the
Midwest conference meet. Each
school in the conference is allowed
to enter two men in the singles
events and one doubles team.
Members of the doubles team may

enter Peisnel‘ and Savage in the
singles and Detjen and George as
the doubles team.

This wul be the first time Grin-
hall has ever competed in this
meet. and, according to Parks,
the Pioneers have as good a
chance to win it as any team
entered. The team which gains
the largest point total is to be
awarded a trophy, and individual
medals will go to the wnner of the
singles tournament and the two
winners of the doubles. Last year,
