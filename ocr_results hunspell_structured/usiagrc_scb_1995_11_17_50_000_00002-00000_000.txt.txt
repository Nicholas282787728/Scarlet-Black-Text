November 17, 1928: in a special meeting of the Student
Council, it was voted that all men are to pay a uniform rate at
varsity dances (regardless of whether or not they have a date.)
The action is intended to raise additional revenue from the “great
number ofmen” who attend dances and cut in on dates the whole
evening. In an editorial one writer explains “[The policy] should
encourage dating and should discourage the large number ofstags
with the accompanying evrls.” The writer sees the action as a
positive move to step up dating (though not "promiscuous dating
in all its forms”) and attendance at the dances.

November 13, 1942: The Student Council President pro—
poses that until all ashtrays are returned to the Quadrangle dining
hall, smoking privileges will be suspended. The Quad had been
supplied with ashtrays for every table at the beginning of the year.
Within one week, seven had already disappeared, setting a trend
of theft which apparently continued far into the year.

November 17, 1950: Grinnell College is scheduled to host
the second annual Conference on Guidance Integration. The
conference selected fifty delegates from four Midwestern states
and faculty interviewed Grinnellians to hear their Views con—
cerning how prepared they were for Grinnell. The purpose ofthe
conference is to improve the transition between secondary schools
and college. The 8&1}: observes, “High schools it is believed place
too much emphasis on social personality rather than on academic
courses." Yet, for the conference, students were excused from
their academic classes to lunch with representatives, attend
general discussions and mix at an informal tea reception.

November 24, 1971: An all campus meeting is called to
discuss the problems at Grinnell, and reVeals that the real
problem is a combination of academic stress and a lack of
interaction. Students express concern over academic stress, a
lack of social outlets, and a lack of interaction with faculty. in
reaction to student criticism one professor comments that with
his current workload, “If i had any more interchange, I would
explode." Appearing directly below this lead story, the S&B
reports that Grinnell College President Glenn Leggett plans to
leave Grinnell on December 15 for a two month trip around the
world. Leggett was given a $5000 grant for a short term leave.
The grant is intended to be a “combat fatigue pay" or for “R&R,"
and stipulates the president receiving it must take a Z to 4 month
leave. According to Leggett the grant is just to give the president
some thinking time.

November 20, 1981: The 5&B reports on a motion to
validate the presidency of student Doug Rowe ‘82, the Judicial
Council and the SOA, in general. The motion follows an 8&1}
article from the previous week claiming that Rowe's presidency
is illegal and was established in an election inconsistent with the
SGA constitution. The motion was passed and legitimated
Rowe’s presidency and the Joint Board as chaired by Rowe. The
motion was perceived to placate concerns that the SGA was an
invalid operating body. But the S&B adds that if Rowe’s
presidency is challenged, then the validity of Rowe and other
SGA members are up in the air, and the entire SGA could be
immobilized.

for independent study

BRIAN WAGNER
STAFF WRITER

Radio drama disappeared in the
4505, and, With the recent graduation
ofSpidermanfromtheCollege,Grin-
nellians may be wondering where

the future ofcampus entertainment
will lend.

To the rescue comes Moonlit
Productions, the idea of Joe Moon
‘98, who plans to resuscitate both
traditions ofperformance entertain—
ment on campus. He hopes his new-
ly formed organization will cultivate
the talents of orinnell's rhespians
and performers in collective efforts

For his first act, Moon and eight
other students have developed an
independent study project where
they Will research radio drama pro
grams from the early history of radio.
The students plan to create their
own program in the style they find to
be representative of earlier programs
such as The Shadow and The Lone
Ranger. Moon says they will also
examine how individuals from dif<
fereni ethnic and nationality groups
were depicted by actors in these pro—
grams.

Although Moon's experience is
in theater performance and amateur
film production, his interest in the
legends ofearly radio have borne in;
research proiect to realization.

The nine students Will begin
broadcasting the thirty—minute Cplr
sodes of their radio program on the
College’s radio station, KDIC, once
it returns to the airearly next semes—
ter. Moon has been assured a weekly
time slot by Charlie Clarke ‘97, sta«
tron manager, and hopes to attain a
primetime slot to attract a large au—
dience.

“i would really like to get people
listening to KDIC again, because i
don’t think they have a lot oflisren«
ers," Moon says. Also, students may
be intrigued to listen regularly be
cause clues Will be revealed in each
episode about a mystery to be solved
