Coltl tor Best Playing,

In a rather listless game the
scarictand blacl: nrnc yesterday
defeated the Davenport team by
the score oi o to 5 and sticccssiul-
iy began a season which it is hop-
ed will land the silver bltt. It was
a ﬁelding game from start to ﬁns
ish. Both teams showed a tour
dency to connect tvitli thc sphere
and it was Grtnucll'ssuperior work
in handling hits that won the vic~
tory. The visiting team proved
stronger with the sticlt but seemr
ed to failat critical moments and
the decision went to the more
consistent team.

Davenport had all tlte best of
the game until the fourth inning,
Grinncll's lone score until then
was the direct result of a pretty
three base hit by Swalm which
sailed far out into right ﬁeld and
rolled to the fence othctwise the
locals hrd not shown dangerous
form, In the foilrth withtwo men
ripon bases, Wisebi'od landed
squarely upon the ball and by the
time it had found its way back to
the diamond, hc was sarciy cs-
tablishcd upon third and Grinnell
was ttvo tallies to the good. The
Leaguers now took a spurt and by
launching their hits secured two
more dc titted to prove
their Mckcnna who hltel
been substituted tor Eis in the
box had but little more success
and the scarlet and blaclt was
abicio score regularly each inns

an error anti t\iisebrod brought in
the winning tally tvtth a Single.

Cold itcaihcr was largely re-
sponsrblc for the poor showing
made. its effect wnsalso evident
upon the attendance, only- a cum-
paratively small knot of enthusi-
aslics bravuig the exposure.

The ﬁrst game of the series
which was to have been played
Monday was called in the second
inning on account of a furious
storm of sleet which rendered its
continuance impossible In this

That this was the original intenr

that the class of '97 adoptetl

not strong enough to ﬁnd its way
