Another argument which is i
supposed to add credence'to ‘
the God concept is man’s poor
grip on reality and the sclfe l
deception needed tor adequate l
functioning. It is quite true 1
that man lives in sell-decep-
tion, e.g. when we see a chair,
we don‘t see the molecular and
atomic make-hp, but rather, a
form in its totality, that is we i
see it functionally.

To go a step further, this dc-l
caption even funnels into thei
psychological area a detensel
mechanism where we, again tori
the sake ot expediency (fuller
tionl take our moral standards
to be correct. Our “way of life"
is right (even to the point of
fighting a war with the Russ
sians, perhapsl; ttiat is, we
rationalize, proieet. etc to keep
ourselves emotionally balanced,‘

For .example, everyone lee-l
lieves himself to he a better
than average driver. to be
rather intelligent and well»bals
aneed emotionally; this is of
course a statistical impossibility.
It is this tvpe of sellrdeception
that Jean Paul Sartre reters to.
However, this subconscious, e
istential self-deception for e.
pedienev can he in no way
equated with consciously avowe
ing a belief in a supernatural
being. '

entirely. I

I do not deny the need for a
rather image—all at us have it
to a degreeibut it is uniortw
hale when it results in con»
seiously admitting to a belief
in a supernatural being. It is
,this traneendence of that which
man is restricted to, viz, draw.

cepts from experience, which.
my reason prohibits. - ‘

Norton said that the changes;-
ate not as drastic as some stu-l
dents might think, but only a‘
return to the original policy at
Grinnell concerning the plan.

Norton gave two reasons i
tor limiting the program to ,
iirst semcstcr. First, the peo-
ple who attend Washington
are supposed to be selected ,
from the superior students on i
i

 

campus who c also poten—
tial lcadcrs.

Thus, many juniors who

here during cleei ns. This, said
Norton, is a disadvantage to

the Student bodyjsls a whole.

Secondly, while the college
