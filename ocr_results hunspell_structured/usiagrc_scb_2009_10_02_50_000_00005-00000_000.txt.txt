“In lune of 2006, [when we opened] some ' '
of the ﬁrst few people that came in a ﬁlled out
applications were actually students," said Lonn
Lease, the owner of Lonnski’s Pub and Deli,
who has employed several students for the past
three years.
This trend is much older than just three
years however, as Grinneilians have been work
ing at the Phoenix Cafe 8c Market since the
establishment opened in 199s. -
Unlike the College, local businesses have no
obligation to hire college students, yet they con»
dnue to due to students' quick learning ability
and trustworthy nature. Jeff Phelps '73, owner
of Saints Rest Coffee Shop, sees the advantages
every time he trains a Pioneer,
“Grinnell students are veryintelligent," said
Phelps, who has an all college student staff.
““They pick up on what we do here very quickly,
that's one of the things that makes it very easy
for me to hire students"
Kamal Hammounda, owner of the Phoenix
Cafe, has noticed the quick study nature as well.
He even notes a carrying over of skills acquired
in the classroom to his kitchen.
“Often times, science majors are the best
cooks. It must be the labs, they are very mes
tieulous about measuring,” Hammounda said.
“They feel the need to [cook] as an experiment"
Running a small business can be incredibly , ,
demanding on the owner, so Phelps said he is v1;
glad tohave Gnnnellians around.

"I trust them to the point that I can walk
out [ofthe coffee shop]. Otlicrwise,l would be

working 90 hours a week" Phelps said. “They're
very important to the success ofthirigs around
here.”

Beyond cooking and relieving owners of
overtime, the students often bring a more aca—
demic atmosphere to kitchen banter, which
Hammounda appreciates.

“In the back, we often have political and sat
cial discussions," Hammounda said. “The stu-
dents give me a new prospective on life."

much time on the Grinnell campus can lead to‘
certain isolation from the outside community.
Maya Andelson '12, who has been working at
Saints Rest since her junior year high school,
views her job as much as an escape as anything
else,

““lt helps me get away from the academic
side of life in Grinnell, helps me meet and keep
in touch with people from the rown,"Andelson
wrote in an csmail. "I hear about town news
that doesn’t necessarily reach campus."

Regardless of the beneﬁts of Grinnelllans
in the workplace, the one problem that affects
all business with Pioneer employees is schedul-
ing. Widi ﬁnals, midtemts, sports seasons and
breaks popping up every semester, conﬂicts can
easily arise. Phelps, while understanding, insti-
tutes a crucial policy with his workers.

“1 knowI have been very fortunate. Almost
all students that work [at Saints Rest] under
stand two things," Phelps said, "If they can't
make a shift they have to ﬁnd someone to work

for them, and the students and l mutually un-
derstand that they came to Grinnell to go to
school, not to work at Saints Rest."

With understanding bosses, an opportunity
for a retreat from academics and an overall sense
of greater connection to the community, it is
easily apparent why so many students take jobs
away from school grounds. Even if they don’t
have a spot for you right now, they probably
have a cup ofcoffee and a snack in the mean
time.

The beneﬁt is mutual, as often spending too
