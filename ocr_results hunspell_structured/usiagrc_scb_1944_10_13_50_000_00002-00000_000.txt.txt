The Man of One World - -

Since the death of Wendell Willliie there
have appeared innumerable editorials. Cour-
ageous, good, great, dynamic are only a
few of the adjectives that have been used
almost unanimously to describe a man who,
were he still living, could easily have
aroused a conflicting storm of opinion
anlong the same people.

i

We would rather combine the adjectives
into a common phrase—great American.
Many will say that such terminology has
become worn, but our feeling is that time,
instead of depleting its meaning, has an-
riched it. When we say American, not one
single idea, even though a composite one
enters our mind. It is many things, things
that can’t be put into adjectives. Willkie
was a man of the people. Somehow he
typifies for us that quality so often attrib—
uted to our nation. Accused of not being
capable of handling complex government
affairs, or of being familiar with the prob-
lems confronting a country such as ours,
he treated the rebukes as a challenge and
set out to learn.

After his defeat in the presidential elec-

 

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

tion of 1940 he didn‘t become another of
the dierllal'd minority, who are anti»adlnin»
istration on any and every point. His att
tude ill defeat was American. The majority
had decided. When he felt the administrnr
tion was acting erroneously, he didn’t resort
to destructive criticism, bllt raised his ob~
jcctions ill a manner that allowed serious
thought to be given them. Nor did he de-
cline to be of service to the government
when needed because he opposed some of
its policies. This is essential to our type
of government and is therefore American
in the fullest sense.

It is also American that his interest
didn‘t lag. He studied the problems facing
our government His was an active interest,
an interest more should share.

Our involvement in the war shook our
foreign policy. Willkie‘s views on the sit—
uation were not those of the self-satisfied
nationalist His convictions were based on
firmer ground. Willliic thought, wrote and
spoke about the theme, “One World." Those
he did not convince were at least confronted
with the disturbing concepti American? We
think so. We think it is one of the broad-
ening elements contributed by our time. The
selfecentered nationalistic attitude is put
aside. Racial tolerance is an integral part,
but the conception of one world demands
further the recognition of the importance
of world cooperation; it demands a foreign
policy in which equal consideration is given
to the welfare of our own and other peos
pics. The taint of exploitation so often
characteristic of our foreign relations would
be eliminated.

Finally with the approaching election
we get one of the truest insights into his
nature. A Republicanﬁyes, but he hadn’t
yet decided how he would cast his vote.
His decision was not to be based on party

affiliation. Rather he was studying the
platforms, and records of the opposing can—

didates. He was an American—a great
American, for his was an active interest
in those things which affect the lives of
all of us, and about which so few of lls
have zl carefully reasoned opinion.

Willkie, the man, is dead. But there is
left the ideal and the spirit of a great
American.

League Speakers
Ask Acceptance
Of Security Plan

Rosemary Fochek, Read senior,
joined Mrs. Charles Payne and
MISS Fannie Buchanan in s dlS~
cussion of the Dumbarton Oaks
conference at a joint meeung of
the town and college League of
Women Voters Monday evening in
the quadrangle drawing room.

 

Miss Buchanan called the con-
ference, which closed this week,
an “international meeting of tech-
nicians.” Miss Fochek said that
the security conference does not
propose that the “Big Four”
insie the world; she also empha-
sized that decisions at Dumbar-
ion Oaks are not binding until
accepted by the several nations
involved.

Concluding the discussion, Mrs.
Payne reminded the audience that
Congress may be unwilling to al-
low dn .Amexicsn representative
on the world council to authorize
the use of U. s. troops, but she
pointed out that quick action
would be necessary to prevent ag~
gression. She said that Wendell
Willhie hsd favored authority by
the president to use force without
a declaration of war by Congress.
