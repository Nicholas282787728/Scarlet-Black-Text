contender as a Winner in the 200.

Consequently the dope has not
changed as to the winner of the 100-

not expected to be pushed scvcrcly.
The other two places in that dash
are undecided. Smith should repeat
his performance in the 220 and win
it handily, However, Vinsel, Wine

It is impossible to forecast the win-

Iowa High School Press Associa-
tion Now Established For
Annual Meetings.

In response to an invitation from ’
Grinnell journalists, Grinnell was
made the annual place of meeting of
the new Iowa High School Press As»
sociation which was organized today
by the ninety delegates who are at-
tending the ﬁrst meeting of the high
school Papers of the state here. At
the business meeting this morning a. >
can ution was presented by a. com-
mittee headed by Clarence I-L'tugen of
Fort .Dodge, and the section milking
Grinnell the permanent seat of the
convention was’adopted unanimously
by the delegates. The meetings in
the future will he held on the last
Friday and Saturday of October, iii-
stead of in the Spring. This was done
because it wits thought that in this
way the delegates would have more
opportunity to incorporate the new
ideas gained from the meetings in
their work for the remainder of the
Ye’u‘

stone First President.

Lewis Stone, editor-elect q; the
Grinnell High School Orange and
Black, was elected ﬁrst president of
the Association following the ammo
tioii of the constitution. Eva Frank-
lin, Newton, wits elected vice-presi-
dent, Glenn Meaghan Ottumwa, sec-
l‘etaryrtl'easulier. A board of direc-
tors composed of Cole Van Gordon,‘
North Des Moines, Lucia McCornack,
Sioux City. and Prof. D. D. Griffith.
Grinnell College, was named. The
board or directors will serve for two
YBEll , Van Gordon was elected for
a one ear term, and after this year
one director will be elected each year.
The new organization is modeled to
some extent on the college organiza—
lion, and will have a. purpose similar
to lllztl: of the college conference.
nftlllely for the exchange of ideas and
experiences gained in work on the
high school publication. Delegates
expressed themselves as having gain-
ed a great den] of valuable data for
use in the future work on their oa—
pers. The round table discussions
,on advertising topics and editorial
questions have brought out a large
number of problems that have puzzled
the young journalists, and many will
return to their papers ready to re—
lpol‘t many new ideas.
In Central Location.

Grinnell \VZLS chosen the seal. of the
convention because of its central 1005.4
trim, and because-of its facilities for
the handling or the delegates while
here. With the Quadrangle and dor—
mitories, and the dining rooms at
both places available for the use o!
the Visitors, the convention was hand-
letl Wlth great ease and efﬁciency.
as Well satisfied with the entertain»
merit. An added feature is the fact
that the campus is not spread out
over such a large terrirtory as to
make the tllstzmces between meeting
places find living quarters too great
for the comfort of the visitors.

The convention attended the Home
Meet this afternoon and their attend-
ed a tea at the home of Dean and
Mrs, J, S. Nollen. The conference
ll'lll close with a. banquet art the
Quadrangle tonight.

A man was seen and heard climbing
the Cottage Four fir-c-cscape at about

reached the third floor lint, realizing
that ho had been scan from the first
floor, he rushed madly down, failing
the last three or four steps. l-le pick-
ed himself up and ran north down
the street. His purpose at the Quad—
ranglc is unknown, Several girls llvA
ing on the fire escape either saw or
heard the fellow and called to room
mates or next door neighbors. It has
been decided that each of the fire—
escape doci-s shall he efully locked
at night from now on and the windows
