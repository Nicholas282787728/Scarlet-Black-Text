Recital Without

Obvious Appeal
to Public Taste

Szigeti, Hungarian Violinist,
Pleases With Encores;

Pianist Praised

By HUGO GDODWIN
(School of Music instructor)

None of the obvious appeal to sup-
posedly popular taste was shown in
the singularly interesting and suc-
cessful concert given by Joseph
Szigeti, eminent Hungarian violinist.
in Herrick chapel Wednesday eve-
ning. He appeared at Grinnell as the
third number of the school of music
1930-31 recital course.

It was almost austere. and the
highest tribute to the artist is the
recognition that through his superb
musicianshi , his beauty of tone, and
his engaging personality, he held his
audience spellrbound. At the close of
the concert the audience refused to
leave until two encores had been add—
ed, “Zephyr" by Hubay and “Bohem-
ian Dance" by Weinberger.

Harpsichord Tone Suggested

In the opening number, Brahms
“Sonata in D Minor,” a singular»
‘1y beautiful ensemble, was presented
by the artist and his accompanist,
Nikita de Magaloff. This sonata is
exceedingly complex in structure, but
the presentation was clear, lucid, and
interesting.

The “Mozart Concerto Number 4,"
which followed, was played in the fin-
est traditional manner. Especially luv
teresting was the sparing use of pedal
by the pianist, which made the piano
suggest the harpsichord tone.

Passage in Harmonics

In the “Rigaudon” by Francoeur,
the favorite violinist of Louis XVI.
Szigeti displayed a scintillating tech-
nic 7 speed, accuracy, rhythm—all
combined to make this a dazzling ex-
hibition.

The “Bach Gavotte in E” for violin
alone was followed by two works by
Paganini, the greatest of all violin-
ists, who lived a century ago. The
second of these was the “Caprice in
E," written in double notes. At the
close of this work a passage in
doublesstop harmonics was tossed off
with an ease and accuracy that would
be the despair of most of Szlgeti’s
tellow artists.

Next Concert March 10

The most interesting number of
the closing group was Szmannwski‘s
“Fontblne d‘Arethuse," a modern
“tour de force” for both pianist and
violinist. This gave a vivid picture of
the nymph who was transformed into
a fountain to escape unwelcome ad—
vances of Alpheus, a river god,

High praise is due the accompanist,
Nikita de Magaloff, a young man of
great musical attainments. His tech—
nic is impeccable, and his accompany-
ing beyond criticism. Exceedingly
beautiful is his pianissimo playing.
One would like to hear him in re-
cltal, especially of modern works.-

The next concert will be given
Tuesday, March 10, by Carlo Zecchi,
pianist.

Gard Considers Prospect
of Second ‘Coxey’s Army’
Slight in Register Article

Wayne Card. formerly head of the
journalism department in Crinnell
college, is the author of an article
on Coxey‘s army that appeared in the
Des Moines Register last Sunday.
Mr. Gard thinks the probability of a
march of the unemployed to Wash—
ington similar to that of Coxey‘s
army is slight because Americans are
less demonstrative now.

Mr. Gard describes in detail the
personnel of Coxey's army, its hard—
ships, the apprehension with which
people received it, and its ultimate
defeat. He points out that although
the demonstration “failed to accom-
plish its immediate ends, it centered
public attention upon the needs or the
Workers."

ST. LOUIS—Coach Don white will
lead his Washington university has.
ketball team into action at Grinnell
Monday night in its third consecutive
Missouri Valley conference game on
a foreign court.

Following the contest with the Pro-
neers, the Bears will return to St.
Louis to begin preparation for it two—
game series scheduled with St. Louis
university Jan. 17.

Maysock Accurate Shot

It is reasonable to believe
Coach White will make some
rangement in his lineup before he
tangles with the powerful Grinnell
team which downed the Billikens be.
fore the holidays, if he entertains any
hopes of making a, showing in the
valley race.

With the exception of Maysack,
center, there is no one on the team
who has displayed any ability on
accurate shots for goals. Captain
Lichenfeld has been out of action on
account of injuries.

Saussele Off Form

Against Missouri, Meysock played
a lone hand, seemingly finding it
not at all difficult to‘ get through
the Tiger defense and in a position
to toss goals. Maysack shot three
in the first half and one in the sec-
ond, after which he had the mister.
tune to be charged with his fourth
personal foul and was compelled to
leave the game.

Just what has happened to Saus-
sele and Constance this season is
indeed somewhat of a mystery. Neith.
er of these boys has played up to
usual standard. Both Saussele and
Constance possess the necessary
speed to carry the ball through the
opposition, but in the games played
to date by the Bears both are al-
ways covered, and for that reason
never in a position to take a pass
from a teammate.

”It has been the opinion of the fac-

favorably with the humor publications
of other college campuses," said Miss
Eleanor Lowden, professor of Eng—
lish, in her talk given at an informal
banquet of members of the Maltenser

Herschel M. Colbert, head of the

the danger to be encountered in in-
dulging in personalities. He told of
Several humorous incidents that he
had encountered in newspaper work.

Mr. Colbert recalled how a linotype
operator had put the words, “a span

livestock exposition, in another news
story in place of “a nine pound baby
boy," that was born to certain proud
parents.
