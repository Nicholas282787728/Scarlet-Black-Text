ord in the 220 yard dash. The present
record, 23.3 seconds is held byKnut-
son of Six. Seconds should be clipped

The quarter and hali mile runs ap»
pear to he anybody's race, with Tay-
lor, Barnes, and Mark having an edge
in the shorter race and Barnes, Klinea
ielter, and Jaussen lighting it out in
the longer. The record may be het-
ter-ed in both events. There are no
outstanding mllers, but Janssen seems
to have the best chance to cop the
race. ‘

Greene or Smith is the class in' the
pole vault and is almost certain to set
a new record in his event. He clears
11 ieet 7 inches consistently. MC-
intyre oi Three is his closest coma

He has leaped over the bar at 5 ieet

Competing against some at the
greatest collegiate racket weilders in
the middle west, the Grinnell pair will
find hard sledding in both singles and
doubles. Coggcshall, who holds the
singles title oi both Nebraska and
Iowa, is looked upon as one oi the

favorites to cop the singles event, but

he will tind opposition oi the sternest
sort from Barnes, Oklahoma Aggie

Again showing a. marked improves
menl. in practically every event, the
Pioneer track team ran better than
was promised and torced the strong
Cyclone tracksters to their utmost to
win by a score of it 1-2 to 56 1.2.
Coach Duke entered a team at Ames
that was expected to be vanquished by
a much larger count, but up until the
last three events the Gl‘iunell team
had good opportunities to cop the
meet.

A Strong wind swept the track from
the northwest, aiding the runners in
the sprints and hurdles, but proving
ﬂ. tremendous handicap to the dis~
tnnce men and jumpers. The wind
reached proportions at. times that
threatened to stop the hurdle events,
the burners being blown from their
places.

Davis nigh roint nan

Wendell (Sonny) Davis led both
teams in scoring, winning both bur-
dles, and placing second in the high
jump and third in tnezzo yard dash.
Davis stepped over the law sticks in

races in the aniey classic this West:-

Crmnell captured both tirst and
Secund in both weight events, and first

Rinefort tossed the brass pellet 44

Pioneer Reputation for Dash Men
Will Receive a Slump In
Valley Classic.

Although Coach Lester Duke has
not issued an oiiicial list oi his ens
iii in the annual Missouri Valley
conference incet which will be held
in Lincoln on Friday and Saturday,
it is practically certain that Crinnell
will bc represented by a mirly com-
plctc team, with entries in most
events.

Cuptltill roster Rlncrort will lead
his loam into the Nebraska stadium on
niternoon, and trout indie.»
lions in past in‘ccts, should be one of
the outstanding luminaries in the
weight events. Rineiort gave certain
promise that he was rccoving his for-
mer [orln last Saturday when he toss-
ed the‘discus 1-14 feet in the Arnes
dual, and in addition tossed the brass
implement as leet, a mark that is Sevs
cral ieet beneath his maximum, His
strongest competition in both events
will be from Thornhill, giant protege
oi ”Doc" Huii at Kansas. Thornhill
has been tossing the weights farther
on every appearance, and gives brom»
ise oi threatening many records be-
[ore his term has been served at the
Jayhawk school.

)lceter to Toss Discus

Meeter will likewise toss the
weights, but the only hope for Grin-
nell points iroin this source lies lnthc
discus, ior Meeter has shown in most
of this springs events that he is cap-
able of nice distance in the platter
event, while his weight tossing has
been only mediocre.

Laird is looked upon as a possible
winner and a sure placer in the jave~
lin. The big spear tlinger hits been
perfecting his style this, week, and
will be in iine shape to go alter his
best distance at the year in the Vale
ley classic. His throwing this season
has been very steady, marks beyolldl
180 feet being'registered in iive meets.
Laird placed fourth in the event last
season at this same meet.

Lung. Davis llurillers

in the hurdles Gl'innell will be rep-
resented by a iairly capable duo, Long

be looked upon as a possible placer in

Joseph McKee, '29, of Stuart, and
Bucll Herman, '29, of Boone, Ion-h,
were elected to pilot the 1829 CY-
CLONE of next year at a meeting of
the staff in the heating plant office
last night.

McKee has been active in journal»

ever, Coach Duke will enter one of
the classiest 440 men in the conier-
ence in that race, and Joe McKee, the
nominee, can well be expected to gar-
Ilish Grinnell's total score with sev-
eral markers. A 50.1 second race in
a dual meet several weeks ago, and
against a strong wind, disclosed the
sophomore stars ability, and hls tine

Robin Hood and His

This Friday evening the hitherto

Robin Hood blows three mighty

captives will be roasted in the noble

All the time they will be entertained
right royally with n-icrrie old ballads
and springtime dances and rollicklng
tunesﬁnnd, most thrilllng or all, a
shooting match at the stoutest archers
oi the brave band, and they are the
very host in all the land. Alter the
prisoners have drunk and feasted to
their hearts content, the outlaws will
show the good old Robin Hood splrit
by releasing them without unloosing
thclr purse strings; ior, as everybody
knows, Robin Hood never took from
the oppressed, but always helped
them in every way he could.

After the captive guests have been
