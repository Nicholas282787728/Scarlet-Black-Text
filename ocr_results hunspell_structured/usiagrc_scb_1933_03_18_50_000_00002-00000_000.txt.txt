BOOK HOARDING

Ill an endeavor to ascertain the true situation
in regard to reserve books a comprehensive statis-
tical analysis l‘ﬂS lddc yesterday, The findings
of the investigé or i vc'filed‘ that about 50 per cent
of the books now on reserve were placed there on
or after February 1.

Nearly 200 books were placed on reserve iii
September 1932 and have remained on that shelf
since. No estimate as to the amount of use these
books get was obtainable.

Very few books placed upon the reserve shelf
in October, November, and December have been
kept there. Only about 300 books placed in these
months are still on reserve. ’

Because of complaints from students that many
books which they would like to check out for 1-4
days are now on the reserve shelf although they
are not required for use in the courses of the pros
fessors who placed them there, the investigation
was made.

\Ve feel that if the students are sincere in their
complaints and it 3 true that these books are no
longer required for study by the professors wllo
placed them there. the books should be removed
from tho shelf and put back into circulation.

Hoarding Good books is as great a sin as heard
ing gold and currency and although records are
kept showing the number of books placed upon res
serve by each professor, it would be better that
these faculty members return the books to circula-
tion of their own free will.

If the professors cooperate ill this wn . there
will be no confusion nor misplaced rcspons lility
that would tend to create friction between the li-

brary staff and the facultv

CHAPEL ATTENDANCE

A lnelnher of the faculty called to our atten-
tion yesterday, the fact, that chapel attendance
is not what it should be.

Of course we don’t like to say “we. told you
so”, but we‘ve thought for a long time that chapel
attendance could be improved a great deal if ad-
vance announcements of the programs were given.
However, since they are not, we have no way of
knowing for sure.

The professor’s suggestion for improved at
tendonce was that of partially segregating the
students according, to classes. His plan is to re-
serve the first few rows of the chapel for seniors
and the second section for juniors. Other students
would take their usual places at the. rear. In other
words it would. be up to each class to fill its section.

We don't know whether class pride amounts to
enough now to have any effect on chapel attend-
ance—but we think the idea is worth a try.

AMERICA’S NEW DEMOCRACY

Of greater consequence than the economy real-
ized through the probable $400,000,000 cut in veter-
ans compensation is the emancipation of American
legislators from the brow-beating tactics of lobby-
ists and pork-barrclers. There is a new opening for
the finest type of Americans ill politics and the
success of democracy now rests with them.

The measure, which in all probability will be
passed intact, cells for the conveyance of the power
of appropriating funds for veterans compensation
from the legislative department to the executive
department,

This move makes ineffective tllc attempts of
lobbyists to force appropriations for their clients
by cocrcing representatives with the threat of dc-
feat ill the ensuing election.

Very few legislators or representatives were
able to stand out against the pressure of: these
lobbyists and still hold their jobs. Not wishing to
forfeit their jobs for a principle, most of those men
fell into lillc and grabbed all that they could for
their constituents when compensation appropria-
tions were wanted.

This deplorable condition has existed for a
long time and its evils have been widely published.
No one could honestly deny the rotten corruption
that had affixed itself to the system. However, all
these evils are about to be fired from American
government.

ALL HAIL! A PRESIDENT!
(Daily O’Colleg'inu)

Not in the memory of most college students has
the United states had a president. There have been
executives, it is true, but it s unfortunately true that
most of them have been politicians as well as presidents,
speakers as well as men of action. True, there has been
no national crisis such as confronts us today, but the
country is fortunate that it has a man at its head who
is willing to take direct and forceful action to affect
recovery.

Franklin Roosevelt is a president. He is willing to
accept sole responsibility for the success or failure of his
projects. He has the courage to demand extraordinary
powers, and the ability to accomplish extraordinary
things. He is a man to whom the country can look
with confidence that be is taking his great responsibil-
ity seriously and making a desperate effort to bring
order out of chaos.

This is no time for a willyrnilly man of words. The
time for badgering-, weaseling, buckrpassing and fence-
riding is past. The country needs and demands action.
It needed and asked for a leader. Its cries are answered.
It has found a president.

WORKING STUDENTS
(Alabama Criirison-wltttc)

The story of a student at the University of Kansas
who received his Doctor of Philosophy degree after
having lived in an automobile one year and subsisted
on law a day brings up the question, “Was it worth
it?“ According to a recent survey, approximately forty
per cent of the students in American colleges work
their way through, wholly or in part. Of this number
perhaps one—third receive no outside help.

It is worth the sacrifice these students are forced
to make? No one doubts that they are to be commended
for their courage and determination. But the popular
conception that a college education is the master key
to success is being- discreted on all sides. No longer do
the press-agent theories of the value of a degree hold.
It has been proved that college is not to he recommended
in every case. Fifty years ago, a college education was
universally accepted as something to be taken at leisure,
a process by which thought was developed.

The 'sad part about the situation is the means by
which a vast army of young men and women too, have
to go about earning their way through college. Take,
for instance, a student who works for eight hours during
the afternoon and night at a drugstore. what inspiration
is be able to absorb from a lecture at nine o’clock the
next morning? Consider the case of the man who is
forced to hurry from his classes every day at home in
order to make deliveries for a cleaning company, and
then perhaps wait on table for two hours before getting
a meal. How can be possibly get the full benefit from
a class in philosophy?

On the other hand it may be sEid that the leverage‘

grades of those student‘s who work their way has been
found to be higher than the grades of those who do not,
Perhaps, they do their outside work while other stu—
debts are engaged in some form of amusement. Per-
sona‘lly, we think it is worth it, without considering the
degree at all, as training for future battles.

Is THIS EDUCATION?
(The Gamecock)

Is this Education?

I can solve a quadratic equation, but I cannot keep
my bank balance straight.

1 can read Goethe's “Faust" in the original, but I
cannot ask for a piece of bread in German.

I can name the kings of England since; the Wars
of the Roses, but 1 do not know the qualifications of
the candidates in the elections.

I know the economic theories of Malthus and Adam
Smith, but 1 cannot live within my income.

1 can mcoglize the ”Leit»Motlf" of a Wagner opera,
but 1 cannot sing a tune.

I can explain the principles of hydraulics, but 1
cannot fix a leak in the kitchen faucet.

~chapel Thursday

He said, “There

has come about

a split in our life

between religion

and economics Until we get a newer

conception of religion we will have
no real religion."

“We have no real religion now her
cause of this split in our cultule,
There has been a separation between
ethics and politics ever since Titus
conquered the Jewish nation and role-
gated their religion to the synagogues
alone."

“The great question today is, “Can
God again function in agriculture,
which is nature, and in industry so
that they will not be apart from
life?”

In the St. Patrick's day chapel, R.
H Perring, professor of German, told
about the landing of st, Patrick in
lreland 1501 years ago yesterday,
about the beginning of the shamrock
tradition, and about the contributions
of the “fighting Irish” in this coun-
try to every branch of industry, po i-
tics and art. .

“Today we are glad to acknowledge
that Irish blood, brain and brawn
have been a valuable factor in the
building of American life today."
