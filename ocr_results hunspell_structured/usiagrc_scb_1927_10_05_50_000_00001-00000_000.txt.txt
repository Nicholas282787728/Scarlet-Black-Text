EVEREST LECTURER FIRST

Gregory Mason, Explorer, Maude
Eoyden, British Pulpit
Orator Speak.

Opening with an illustrated descrip-
tion of the last attempt to scale Mount
Everest, the Grinnell college Lecture
course will present a variety of in-
struction and entertainment to local
audiences this ycftr. Three numbers
have been definitely arranged at tile
present time; others will be added un-

' til the total reaches 5. all of which
are to be given in Herrick chapel.

Captain John B. Noel, official phot0~
grapher of the 1924 Everest exped-
ition, will appear at Grinnell on
November 1, "0n the Roof of the
World." Interest in Captain Noel’s Eld-
dress is increased by the use of motion
pictures which tell the story of the
last attempt to scale the World's
highest mountain. The Cincinnati
TIMES called these pictures more
amazing than ﬁction. They tell not
only of the expedition itself, but also
of life in Tibet. Where Women may
have as many husbands as they wish,
but a man may have only one Wife.

Lost Cities Topic.

rollowing directly in the footsteps
of Captain Noel, lecture course pa-
trons will travel in spirit to another
part of the World, when Gregory Ma-
son discusses "The Lost Cities of
Yucatan.” Mason, a. brilliant journal-
lst and well-known explorer, travelled
recently through many thousand
square miles of Central American ter-
ritory which had never previously
been touched by white men. He did
this while making archeologicci exca-
vatlolls for the American Museum of
Natural History and the Peabody
Museum of Harvard university. Dis-
coverles made by Mn Mason indicate
that the Mayan civilization which
flourished before the days of the Span-
ish conquistadors rivalled the cultural
achievements of ancient Egypt. Mason
will employ stercopucan Slides in his
lecture, showing in natural colors the
products of Mayan art. He appears
on November is. .

Itoyden Here February 2 .

The third number which the lecture
committee has arranged is an address
by Maude Royden. which will be given
on February 24. Miss Royden is prob-
ably the foremost pulpit orator in
Great Britain today, drawing thous-
ands to hear her eloquent sermons.
Her talents have made her one of the
leading women citizens of the British
empire.

Further announcements about other
numbers will be made later,

Season tickets for the entire lecture
course will be on sale at the Bartling
and Nllcltolls jewelry store for two
dollars. This price amounts to less
than half the total cost of single dds
missions for the six numbers. Semes-
ter fees will admit the student body.

Students Talk In
Chapel For Drive

Lovejoy, Allen and Wang Make
A Plea. for Pioneer Chest
Funds Monday,

Chapel services Monday were con-
ducted by representatives of each of
the three organizations benefited by
the Pioneer Chest fund, the Y. M. C.
A,, Y. W. C. A, and Grinnellrinrcliina,

Mr, Theodore Lovcjoy, president of
the Y. M. C. A, speaking on behalf of
the organization, discussed the origin
of the Pioneer Chest drive in crinnell,
and explained the entice dependability
of the Y.'M. C. A. on student contrl<
huuons. In addition to the funds
which the local Y. M. C. A. must con-
tribute to the State and national
councils, it also must have a certain
amount to expend on community char-
ity, and on school projects.

Allen Discusses Activities.

The activities at the Y. W. C. A.,
which require financing from this fund,
were discussed by Miss Barbara Allen,
president of the Association. Such
matters as ﬁnancing the appearance of
certain speakers who will address the
students throughout the year, sending
representatives to Y, W. C. A, con-
ferences, and maintaining college tra-
ditions, must be provided for by the
Y. W. ‘C. A.

Mr.‘ Wang Yuan»l~lsin, a represent-
ative of Grinnell—ianhina, who is
studying in Grinnell this Winter, ex
pressed the appreciation of the chin-
ese Students for the assistance which
they have received through the Pio—
neer Chest fund. As a mark of this
gratitude, he presented the college
with a banner from his school in
China. President I. H. T. Main ac-
cepted for Grinnell college.

Opposing Forces In China.

which maintains that force is law, and

‘CHAMI'AN TALKS T0 CLASS.

.7. Forrest Chapman, representative
to Grinnel-in-China, took charge of
Miss Road's education class last Tues—
day.

He described the customs and habits
of the Chinese people as he had ram“,
izirized himself with them anti told the
freshmen many experiences he had

 

had in his school work,

 

agreements by love and Christianit.
The spirit of Grilmell is exemplified
by the latter group. in this way,
Grinncll, by helping China, is promotr
ing the welfare of the world.

The poverty of the Chinese people,
which hinders their educational pro-
gress, and large number of students
in each school, are two difficulties
which the Grinnellriiirchind appurt—
ionmcnt from the Pioneer Chest fund
has helped to relieve.

Poem 0n Runner.

A free translation of the Chinese
poem on the banner presented ex—
presses this thought:

"Recipient of abundant llberality,
Porter Middle school is deeply grct -
ful to Grinnell. students and alumni!
America and China have joined hands

uowlcdging your gracious kindness. wc

Valley Schools
Remain Dormant

No Definite Action to Date Has
Been Taken Concerning
Valley Future,

By Arthur COX.

Sincc the withdrawal of six of the
larger schools of the Missouri Valley
conference last week, there has been
much speculation as to what would
be done by the four remaining mem»
bars of the conference.

An announcement has been made
that the four remaining schools will
meet as usual at St. Louis on Decem-
ber 2 to draw up the conference ath-
letic schedule and to decide what is to
be done. It is possible that several
new schools will enter the conference
to take the place of those which have
Seceded. As yct, however, no appli-
cations for admittance have been re-
ceived. Schools which might be in-
vital] into the conference are .Creighr
ton, Coe. Cornell, Morningside oi- the
new Lincoln and Lee university in
Kansas It is possible that Oklahoma
A. and M. will join the Southwestern
conference since it is so far away from
the other remaining members of the
conference.

Drake Billy Free-Lance. .

There have been rumors abroad to
the effect that Drake is trying to get
a berth in the Big Ten conference, but
these rumors have been flatly denied
by President Morehouse of Drake. As
for as football is concerned, Drake
is in favor of becoming a free lance
like Notl'e Dame and Marquette, but
this would lower their standard in oth—
er sports,

ci-innell might resentcr the Midwest
conlerence which they deserted when
they joined the Missouri Valley Cons
forcucc. In this case they would be
associated with schools more
own size, and at the sfime timc having
a fairly good athletic reputation.

May Orgniiizo New Groups.

There has also been much talk
about abandoning the Missouri Valley
oonforcucc entirely and organizing a
new conference to contain such teams
.ts Carleton, Wabash, Knox, DePauw
and Beloit In addition to Gi'iiiuell.

Three of thc main papers in the
stats of Oklahoma. have offered much
resistance to the so called “his Sir."
They fire the Daily Oklahoman, the
Oklahoma City Times, and the Tulsa
World. The opposition has been caus-
cd by the refusal of the “Big Six" to
allow Oklahoma A. and M. to become
a member of the new conference. They
change that the new conference was
lnstigotcd by Nebraska which has al-
ways opposed the Oklahoma Aggies.

Washington Silent.

Washington alone has not said much
concerning the breaking up of the con-
ference. They are just going to re~
main passive until everything has been
decided, it seems.

in response to a letter sent by Pres-
idclit Main, Dean Thompson of the
University of Nebraska has issued a
statement in which be thoroughly
backed the “Big Six," in his state-
ilieut however, he dcnicd that the
incmbcrs of the “Big Six" would with-
draw their support from the Drnlre
Relays.

even better than. the Missouri Valley

China Tells Where, What,
Why, How There.

WAR END TO NEW REGIME

Gives Picture of Porter Middle
School and Conditions of
Students, Country.

“China is trying to accept' our civ-
lllzation. Slle recognizes Civil war
only as it means of bringing about a
new regime," said Forrest Chapman in
his chapel talk Tuesday. Mr, Chap—
man endeavored to tell the where.
what, wily, and how of Grinnell-in-
China as gleaned from his two ’years'
experience as a. part time teacher of
English in tile Porter Middle school at
chhow. '

' Only School In Area.

The Grinnell school in China is the
only high school in an area with twics
the population of Iowa. Chinese boys
have marched thirty miles in order to
take part in the primary track meets
at Techow. There are 200 students in
the boy's school, and 175 in the girl's
school wi ,s combined faculty of
about 23. ’

The school has practically no teacb- ‘-
ing equipment, no electric lights, and
no heat in the dormitories. The scho<
lastic standing is such, however, that
these students fil'e' accepted without
examination into nearly every college
in China.

The region about Techow is strictly
agricultural. The average farm, about
five acres. yields enough produce to
furnish the farmer with food and mam
ufacturing materials, and bring him a
yearly income of about sixteen Am-
crcan dollars.

Students I’liy Tuition.
The money sent to Grinnellrinrchlna
supplies a few American teachers, new
buildings, and improvements. The
students furnish the money for their
tuition.
In speaking of China as a close
neighbor to America and a country of
vast resources, Mr. Chapman said,
“Certainly she will be our customer in
the future; certainly we want her to
be our friend." He also said that
some day China will be able to hell?
herself, and when that time comes
there will be some expression of grat—
itude. it is for us a privilege to help
rather than a duty. /
