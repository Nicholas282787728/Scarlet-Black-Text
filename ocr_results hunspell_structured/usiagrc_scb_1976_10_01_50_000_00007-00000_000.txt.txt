Forum on

Brecht’s Epic Theatre, the
literature of the absurd and the
work of Thornton Wilder will be the
subject of an informal symposium
to be held in the South Lounge of
the Forum on Thursday, Oct. 7.
The discussion will center around
Wilder's The Skin of Our chth and
the Theatre Department's up
coming production which opens on
Oct 14. First produced in 1942, the

lay, according to Wilder was an

Sttempt, along with his earlier Our
Town, to break out of the “strait

jacket of realism” in which the

American theatre found itself.

Open Eye to come
into View

Theater oi the Open Eye. with its
troupe at actors, dancers and
musicians under the direction of
internationally iamous dancer-
director Jean Erdman, has been
signed to appear at Grinnell
College this month. it was ans
nounced by 3,.) Voertman,
Department of Theatre

The New York-based company
will he in residence Oct. la, 19, 20
and will present periormances on
the evenings oithe 19th and 20th, as
well 'as various master classes
during the three day period, Ms,
Voertman, residency director, said
that residency activity details will
be announced later,

Founded by Ms. Erdman and
Joseph Campbell, Theater of the
Open Eye is dedicated to the
creation of works of total theater
The idea for such an artiuniting
music, dance and dramaiwas
inspired by the Japanese Noh
theater and the symbolic “Plays
for Dancer" of the Irish poet, WE
Yeats, as well as the earlier
association of Ms Erdman and
Composer TeiJi Ito in “The Coach
With the Six insides.”

Dance Magnline critic Robb
Baker said, “Jean Erdman’s work
is special to me: she finds the same
links between myth and
movement, magic and meaning,

absurdity

and similarities of intent can be
round betweenthese plays and the
works of Brecht, Pirandello and
perhaps even lonesco, although
thematic ditterences abound.
These similarities and differences
will be explored.

Taking part in the discussion will
be Charles Davis, English; Brian
l-larris, German; Glenn Johnson,
American Studies; Jenny
Michaels, German; and Sandy
Moffett, Theatre. Karl Hare

play

Cellist Terry King and pianist
John Jensen will present a varied
program ot rarely heard com-
positions in Herrick Chapel 3200
pm Oct. 8. Among these will be
Busoni's (1886 - 19241 “Kultaselle
Variations" and Bruch’s (1338 -
1920) ”Konzerstuck” Both com-
posers are quite reknown for their
individuality and spirituality
though they did not quite make as
lasting an impression as Brahms
or Puccini in all their come
positions. This performance will be
the first in at least fifty years of
these little known pieces, the result
of much research on the part of
King, other works will be by Saint
Saens, Prokofiev. and short pieces
by Weber, David, Ravel and
Sibelius.

King has studied with the late
tamed cellist, Gregor Piatigorsky.
He also served as assistant in
Piatigorsky’s Master Classes at
usc and has concertized coast to
coast, always receiving high
critical acclaim. King and Jensen
are part oi the Mirecourt Trio now

SGA was establishing a line oi
communication Wilh the Trustees
oflhe College. to let them know lhe
concerns ol the students at this
lime

After SGA'S statement had been
presented, debate ensued about
how student action will be coora
dinated with official SGA action (in
these matters It had become
apparent to everyone by this lime
that all present agreed to the basic
issues at stake Many students
present wished to become actively
involved in these issues along the
lines of SGA'S official committees,
and wondered if parallel action
groupswould result. lt.was pointed
out that SGA is a good instrument
for certain lypes of action.
especially in the form of forums
and written reports. but due to its
committee structure is too sluggish
for immediate reactions lo events
it ivas,a1so.ielt,that SGAi-ISVEH
inappropriate vehicle for mass
demonstration of - student
discontent.

It was agreed that SGA would
welcome any input by concerned
students addressing its three
courses (ll action on lhe ,ad~
ministratwe reorganization, and
desires a ”lotal exchange oi ideas '
with any groups acting on these
concerns

Capping the meeting was osA's
statement of intent, which ex-
plained its ovin desire ioi
autonomy on "‘aclical ' grounds
Its members feel that a more
\isiblc display or student sen-
timent than SGA can musler would
be valuable.
