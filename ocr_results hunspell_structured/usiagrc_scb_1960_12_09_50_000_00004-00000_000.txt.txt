lmporled Tutorial Syslem Employed

cs
British history class during a
brake, could be used
seminars.

by Ruth Gruenewold
(lecture editor)

Independent investigation and
greater personal contact be.
tween professor and studcnt
characterize the tutorial pro—
gram now being used by George
Drake's British history cla
Under the tutorial system learn—
ing becomes a more active pro»
cess. The student prepares his
work independently and terms
his own interpretations on the
basis of what he reads, instead
of automatically adopting the
viewpoint of the instructor, as
is often the case in regular lec-
ture courses.

At Oxford University where
Drake studicd tor two years
as a Rhoadesﬁchoiar, tutorials
have been the backbone of the
academic program for the past
one hundred years, The only
lectures given there are similar
to Grinnell’s special lectures,
and no reading is required for
them.

Tutorials are presented orally
and/or in written form, after
which the tutor and pupil di5e
cuss and criticize them. in study
ing, a problematic approach is
used; the individual attempts to
answer questions by reading a
number of‘ different books pres
sciiting various points of view
before writing the tutorial,

No grades aregivcn; rather,
the tutor gives his opinion or
the Student’s work, and at the
end of the course exams are
given to determine whether
or not the work_coinpleted
has becn satisinctory.

One or the advantages or the
tutorial system that Grinnell
students might lind most appear
ing is that there is no constant
pressure to prepare lessons on
a daily basis. Under this syse
tem interest dictates the amount
of effort put forth, and the in
dividual can plan his work ac—
cordingly. The professor, too,
has more time to devote to re-
search and outside interests.

Tutorials allow a complete dc.
parture lrom the textbook ap—
proach to learning. The student

is lorced to lornr his own coll-l
