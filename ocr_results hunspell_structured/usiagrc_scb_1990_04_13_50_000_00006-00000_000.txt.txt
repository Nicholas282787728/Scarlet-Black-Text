Opportunities: It's
Make or Break Time

Finals are a month away, As the time for sheer panic approaches.
frusuated students begin to assess their goals for the remainder of the
academic year and their capabilitim ofachicving those goals. The more
destitute may question their purpose of attending Grinnell or even their
purpose for living. In such times of academic despair, thr- Scarlet and
Black wishes to address two questions that inevitably arise around this
time, if not before.

Many students have asked why the library is open on Friday nights
anrlSaturday morningsratherthan Saturday nightsandSuntlay mornings
throughout the academic year. Fridays are traditionally the epitome of
the weekend mentality, and Sunday mornings seem just as appropriate
for an open library as Saturday momings~on either day sleep or activi—
ties can tempt even the most academicallyrconscious mind from quality
slutty time. But at least the opportunity to study should be available.

According to the college librarian, Burling is already open 105-107
hours a weekduring normal academic yearperiods. Hiringmore stafffor
extended hours requires additional staff and funds. Moreover, it is just
as difficult to attract staff to weekend hours as it is to attract students to
the books at those times. There must boa regular college employée in the

* building at all times.

But the liltrary should be open Saturday nights and Sunday mornings.
Perhaps more studentcmployees are necessary. If Burling to is not open
at these hours because of a perceived lack of interest, how should
students express this needilcltcrs to the editor, letters to the administra-
tion, or gmfitti on the walls?

The designated Friday night computer shutdown is another student
concern. What about students who have extensions until Saturday
morning‘.l Computer Services claims that everyone, staff and students.
must make a sacrifice. Anotheroption ofaltemating the shutdown times
of the academic VAX with the adminisuative VAX is too difﬁcult,
because parts of the systems are operative on the same disks. Maybe the
VAX should be shut down Saturday nights. If Burling remains closed
that night. then why not coordinate it with the shut-down of the VAX?

These may be appear as petty student gripes. But when students face
deadlines, papers, perhaps cliffhanger grades, the gripes aren't so petty
if the only study alternative is a less-than-silent dorn. lounge. More
opportunities to study may make us all sleep a little easier.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.
Hopkins Medal Recipient
Condemned as Inappropriate

To the editor.

"We should not deny Latin
Americathe riglltto democracy. . .
. Nicaragua has never had a demo-
cratically electcdgovemment,”Sol
Linowitz stated on Wednesday
evening. Bynot”denying”Cenual
America, or selectively accepting
its leaders. Linowitz is exerting our
imperialistie influence over so-
callcd “autonomous" nations. Li-
nowitz speaks of a “democratic"
Latin America, but in expressing
this choice he makes the assump
tion that Latin Americans are not
capableofchoosingthcirownform

seen the U.S. Government insti-
gate or actually participate in vio-
lent action in Latin America, such
as in Chile, Panama, El Salvador,

a few; all were in the name of
“democracy." Who are we to im-
pose our views on independent
nations?

Democracy is a term that is
loosely used and often distorted.
Linowitz claims that 95 percent of

How can democracyreign in coun-
tries where people live in constant
fear of becoming disappeared.
“Democratically elected" leaders
such as Christiani in El Salvador
and Cerezo in Guatemala have
equaled or surpassed human rights
violations of past dictators in their
respective nations.

We applaud the choice of lus-

tice Brennan as the inaugurating
Harry Hopkins medal recipient last
year. But We condemn the choice
of S01 Linowitz as a person who
represents “the standard at service
which significantly advances both
the public welfare and human dig-
nity."

Education on Rape
Necessary for Crime
with No Bonndaries

To the editor.

Due to circumstances, there is a
significant time lag between theinr
cident mentioned and the time this
letterwasprinted. Irealizethis,hut
I also know that the situation it
describes is unfortunately still rcler
vant.

The day before the “Its/He Says
No and You Still Go, It‘s Rapid”
program, I asked a male acquain—
tance ofmine ifl’ie was planning to
go. He hemmed and hawcd for a
minute or two and finally mumbled
“Er, no." When I inquired as to the
reason. he said ”Because I don't
ever plan to be in that position."

Oh.

What will you do if someone
very close to you that you care
about is raped, assaulted. or har-
assed? A good friend, your sister,
your girlfriend, your mother? Rape
knows no boundaries of class,
gentler, or age. What will you do?
How will you react? You won’t
know what to do or what not to do.
because you didn’t educate your-
self. You didn't plan to be in that
position, remember? Rape has

nothing to do with you. Survivors
know who they can trust to tell and
whowillsupportthemastheyheal.
I guess that person just won’t be
you.

After something as violating,
degrading, and humiliating as a
rape or sexual assault, survivors
(don’tcall Ihem victims) go through
hell. But this hell is made a little
easier if those around them have
educated themselves on rape, its
effects, the healing process and
maybe even - gasp! - its preven-
tion.

So maybe you‘ll read this letter
and think “Gosh, that’s terrible, I
(should really do something" and
then immediately forget about it.
Or if you care, you‘ll educate
yourself. If you‘re uncomfort-
able when you rcadthislcttcr. don‘t
accusemcofbringingupmpeatan
innppropriateu‘me. Auddon’twrite
me off as a militant anything.
This is about treating other human
beings with compassion.

If you think rape has nothtng to
do with you, think again.
