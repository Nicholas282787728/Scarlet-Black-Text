GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

But wait a moment. Commencement day
really means the day of beginning as any
etymologist will testify. As the college sen-
ior reaches out to receive his diploma, he
is at that moment not only ending a defi-
nite period of his life, but starting- a new
peliod of life as it Bachelor of Arts. Before
llilu stretches the panorama of life as it
really is, life without the protectin' walls
of a higher institution of learning. Life he-
,rzills at Commencement day for the class of
’41.

This year’s Commencement day holds a
greater significance than this, however.
Monday will go down as an auspicious day
in the annals of Grinncll’s history, for it
marke the beginning of a new Gl'innell. To-
day we have seen the ground broken for
new buildings on the campus—all event
which has not occurred for a quarter of a
celltur and one forecasting- lllany silimar
ceremonies in the very near lutnre. This is
the obvious side of the new Grinnoll. 01"
more importance than this, students will
return next fall to an entirely different plan
of studV, a radically revised curriculum.
Nowhere ill the country is there a plan 01'
study boasting all 01' the advantdes and
benefits ol" Grinnell’s set-up for it inco n
pol'eltes the Very best leatl es that have
proved successful in such pl'oo cssivc col-
lege and universities as Chic go, Sll'artlr
more, Oberlin, Rutgetrs, and St. John’s.

To the class of ’41. as all outstanding ex-
ample and symbol of the many classes who
have passed through the pol' 115 of G "ll
nell, we wish to direct this thought. Grill—
nell college is on the threshold of it new
lifeiluay you and your predecessors keep
this uppermost ill your mind and bestow on
Grinuell your continuintl cooperation and
ulistirlted support.

Grade Change
Plan Nol’ Dead

Agitation for a change in the
grading system at Grinnell has
reached the faculty committee
stage, Kent Hampton, student
Council president, announced to-
day. The proposed change would
install the A-B-C system of grad-
ing for the one now in operation.

in a survey conducted recently
in the dormitories and quadran—
gle, it was discovered that stu-
dent sentiment favors the A7370
method, All but one hall and one
cottage voted for the new plan.

“If no action on the measure is
taken by the faculty this year,"
Hampton said, "we intend to
carry through with our proposals
next year." The educational polb
cies committee would have to ap-
prove of the change.
