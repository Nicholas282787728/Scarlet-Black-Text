Moor Bern’s Cast, Set and I
Costuming Achieve Success

By Gerry Warren i

The cast of Miior Born, Grinnell
college theater production, strug-,
glcd valiantly last Friday and
Saturday nights to weld a plot-
less story and stilted lines mm
a passable play, and by virtue
of their acting almost succeed-
ed.

Supposedly a psychological stu.
dy, showing character develop-
ment and degeneration, the play
sacrificed all reality and even
feasibility to these ends: and
thereby made the characteriza-
tions' ‘mposslble.

Probably the original selection
of the play is at fault. It was'
too heavy, too highly dramatic
for an amateur production that
strives for professional results

. for in the staging, costum-
ing, and acting, the production
approached professionalism.

The set was extremely well
done. Highlightcd by Mrs, Kent
Andrews' portrait of the three
sisters, designed m take advan-
tage of limited stage space, givcn
authenticity by period pieccs and
atmosphere, it left little to be de-
sired.

The costumes, designed by
Kent Andrews, and executed by
him and his production class,
were outstanding. Thcy blended

 

with the set, the characters, and

the somber mood of the Wind-
swept moors.

Stuart Reader’s Branwcll took
ma>timum advantage of the part.
in tlic first scene, Branwell was
portrayed as a promising young
poet and writer, the pet of the
family. His subsequent decline
into a moral and physical wreck
as the result of an unhappy love
affair was as convincing as pos-
sible under the circumstances.
His highly dramatic lines were
well handled when the obvious
temptation was to oyerrplay
them. After his scmi-off-stagc
demisc, the play definitely slump-
cd.

The parts of the three sisters,
played by Virginia Foote, Mar—
guerite Watson, and Barbara
Macoubrcy were also acted above
the level of the play itself. Miss
Foote was a talented, sophisticat-
ed Charlotte: depressed and frllse
trated by her confining envil‘one
ment. She bore the entire bur-
dcn of the last sccne. a sccnc
for which there was no excuse
other than to inform the audi-
ence of Ann‘s death. She had
to show the audience, ﬁvithout
the aid of dialogue, the clone,
ness felt by the only surviving
membcr of the Bronte family.
She handled this well.

Miss Watson’s Emily, the most

dramatic and picturesque of the
three sisters, was done with
commendable restraint. Her sym-
pathy for Branwell made her love
able, Her death scene was prob-
ably her best. Ann, played by
Miss Macoubrcy, helped lighten
the depressing mood of the play.
Ann was convincingly frail, win—
some, and slightly pathetic, the
only nearly normal member of
the weird family.

The maids part were entirely
superfluous to the action of the
play, serving only to fill, by
‘coiiversaticn, the gaps in infor-
mation left by the plot, Alicc
Powers and Margaret Roland
played Tabby and Martha with
all the skill required by the
parts.

David Gotham was the father
of the Bronte family. Blind at
his first appearance, he groped
his way through the scene in
a realistic way. He portrayed
the weight of his disappointment
in his only son Branwcll as the
central aspect of the characteri~
zation, and rightly 50.

Although the selection of the
play was unfortunate, its aims
were high. It is to be commend
ed on this count. The amount
of work in producing and inter.
pi-cting it were easily rccogniz-
able. We feel that it was not
