9 Pinza Is Scheduled.

Ezio Pillza, celebrated Metropolitan cpela
star, will appear here as scheduled on April
29.

We are glad he is coming.

Because Pinza is a friend of Mussolini and
is now being held at Ellis Island for quess
tioning, some have thought that the school
is unpntriotic for wanting his talent here.

We believe this thought is ill itsell‘ un-
patriotic. It is that kind of patriotism
which would bar Wagner, or Mozart be-
cause they are Gelman.

Artistic talent, musical genius, is univers-
al. It transcends the artist and becomes a

mystical bond between the peoples of the
earth.

Pinza, himself, is not guilty of wrong
doing. He has not been proved guilty. He
has not even been accused of a sin. John
Gunther, in “Inside Europe”, speaks rather
highly of Mussolini. Does that make him a
dangerous person? One can be a friend of
an individual yet disagree with his political
philosophy.

Let us not judge Pinza by his friends;
let.us enjoy his music, and forget about the
man.

0 Tobacco and the Quad.

Occasionally one is apt to hear a freshman
giving his first impression of Grinnell ill
such terms as, “You cant turn around with-
out loumpillg illto a tradition.” Alld occasion-
ally those who have become accustomed to
the traditional patterns are likewise apt to
stop and wonder in such a manner.

On the quadrangle side of the campus
there has been a good deal of wonder about
the matter of smoking in the women‘s din~
ing—room.

Since the beginning of President Stew
ells’ regime, a certain staid reverence l'or
such rules has deservedly vanished. As the
girls see it, there is now no reason to honor
the rllles laid down by a past era.

They realize the possibility of a fire 11212--
and in their rooms, but surely not ill the
diningsroom. The ventilation facilities, more—
over, are much more adequate in the quad
rallgle dining‘room than at the men‘s dorm-
itories.

And visiting Rotarians and other digni-
taries never hesitate to ﬁll that long wait
between the main course alld dessert by
smoking. As long as the tradition has been
broken, even slightly, the Gothic atmosphere
should no longer stand in the way of pro—
gress.

To prove to little children all

not.

To The Editor:

It has finally been brought to the
attention of some of the seniors
that the Senior Council, made up
of class officers, hss decided upon
a senior class gift to the school
without consulting one class as a
whole. We feel that this is an ins
justice!

The gift, which is not perma-
ment and will not cost the class
nny expense, consists of sending
certain seniors to middls west
clues to try to intcrcst pros-
pective students into coming to
Grinncu. This, while it will have
immcrlinto bcncﬁt to the college,
docs not seem to us to he of
enough [lennuuleut mine to be h
clnss gift. who, five years from
now, will ever know what the
Clnss of 42 gave to Grinnell Coir
loge? None. except thosc select-
ed few scrum-s who visit Kansas
city, Omnhn, Minneapolis, nnrl
Chicago. Yrs, u. will be n “on—
llcl'lul gift to them.

The one point in favor of such
c gift is that, according to the
plan, thc collcgc is going to pay
the expenses of those making the
trip. In other words, the college
is going to pay for its own gift.
We're certam that most of the
seniors would be willing to pay
some cold cash in order to have
something permanent! ! l
