‘When words fail,’ dance

Characters explore life, love and family bonds through movement in Dancing at Lughnasa

by Leslie Boyadjian
This weekend Grinnellians have the opporruniry to be rransporred to
the home orthe five Mundy sisrers living as spinsrers in 1950: Ireland.
Dante is a key element in their lives and communication. According to
Director Lesley Delmenico, Theater, Dancing zit
Lughnasa by Brian Friel is a story oreopiog, loving
and “people whose lives are too small for their spir.
In.“

The role of dance

DcIn-ienico cxploincd that the characters orthe
play wanr more than they have in their lives. When
they feel a void, they use dancing to help cope with
iharderieit. The play ooniains many diirereni kinds
of dancing ihrough which the characters rind sos
lace '

There are walrres, which symbolize love between
two of the characters, Gerry Evans played by Noah
Siegler '05 and ClirissyMundy played by Rcbecca Mauldin '05.Th:wa.ltm
not only signify love, they also provide Gerry with a way to cope with his
life.

“I feel alive when l'm dancing," said Sicglcr in reference to Gerry. “In
the play, when I dance wirh Chrissy we fall back in love
with each other,"

At one point Gerry proposes to Chrissy, but she res
fuses.

“Chrissy doesn't marry Gerry bemuse as much as she
loves him and craves the reciprocation of Lhis love, she
lsnows Gerrywill ultimarely leave her." said Mauldrn. "The
only land of relationship Gerry can otter her is one that
comes and goes."

For Gerry and Chrissy dancing is as close as they get
in marrying one another. in spite of the faer that the share
acters love onc another and urpress this love ihrough dance.
they cannot marry. Delinenieo believes that this stilnng
inability to communicate is a common morirorthe play

“This play is really about what happens when words
fail," said Delinenieo.

The delicate naruie oirhe relationships among chaiaerers is much oi
the reason words prove inadeguare as a means oiexprsssion. “The two
sisters are so connected and love each other so much that what one does
arrears the entire household," said Mouldin. “This play is extremely cmor
nonally charged which makes for a precarious balance between calm and
chaos "

and chaos."

Riley had been doing irish srep dnneing (or many years and when she
saw a ilier about an irish play about dance, she usut

__ ally mentioned ihnr she loved Irish step dancing.

“This play iS extremely

ous balance between calm

Dclmcnico and rho east adopted a “rind rhar woman"
menialiry and tracked Riley down to help choretr
graph moves for the play. Riley agreed to reach the
east to danee ln spire oirhe raer that she hadn’t raughr
much and never for anyone over the age oiren.
Drawing from her knowledge oibasie irish step
dances. Riley made up a coinoiniiion ioosoiy bond
on a dance known as the Bonnie as well as an eight.

—R€b€CCO Mauldl'n ’05 hand dance, which consists of eight dancers.

“Teaching them was very tun," said Riley. “They

_———— pielsod it up pretty quickly."

Riley wasn't used to groups picking up on rhesreps
so easily, but she attributes the nuieis learning with her students being
twice the age other former danoars.

Forsiegler the experience was pretty unique and even though his char»
aeier never participates in the irish step dances he still learned the movis
in rehearsals.

“[Dancing] was..,rcally new to ine. Pin a terrible
dancer," he said laughing. “it was great. it just helps to
kind oipui you in that [setting]."

The rest orrhe oasr members agree with siegler about
enjoying rhe dancing aspect of the play “I iihe dancing or
lot," said Linda Johnson '05. “This play-s really awesome
oeoausc it's all about dancing."

That's not to say that it wasn't work for everyone, and
Johnson in pariieuiar had an extra need to learn to dance
wcll.

"Theres iwo rotereneos in the script ihar I'm ihe mosi
elegant dancer." said Johnson who plays Agnes. with a
smile she added, "yeah right.”

Along with Mauidin, Johnson had to learn both lrish
and ballroom danring tor the play,

”Ballroom was a little bit harder," said Johnson, “I guess because it has
to look gnorL .so there’s a hole more pressure on rhar side,..bur us still
fun.”

“Griimcll is so wonderful in terms or the resources [available]"
Dclmcnico said. “im ﬁnding thoshovvs [ do always have music unddane,"

Concert Preview

Javanese Music and Dance
Saturday, May 3
7:30 pm in Sebring-Lewis

This Saturday, SebringsLewis iiall will be taken over by
white monkeys, abducted princesses and inept ogre: in
the traditional Javanese dance drama Senggona abong, or
honumon oi the Stake. This episode of the Hindu epic The
Ramayana will culminate the annual performance of the
Grinnell College Javanese Music and Dance Ensemble.

The program will begin with three Javanese pieces
periormed by the 23rperson gamelan ensemble, directed
by Roger Vetter, Music. The musicians will play traditional
instruments such as gongs; bonings, whlch are a set of
about a dozen gongs: and a melodic, Xylophone-like saron.

A gamelan refers to a specific, unique cullettlon oi
Javanese instruments. taeh gamelan is tuned to a nun»
standardized scale, so it produces an entirely individual
sound. Grinnell's garnelan, known as Kyahi Biwara or "The
Venerable Herald," includes almost 50 instruments made
from iron, steel, teak and jarkfruil: wood and given to the
college in the memory of Rebecca Kresse '95.

“tor a college our size it’s pretty uncommon," said
Vettec ”Most of the colleges with Javanese music or dance
ensembles are large universities with Southeast Asian
graduate programs. We may be the only undergraduate
college to have both music and dance programs.” he said.

Velter directs the musical component of the ensemble,
while his wife Val Vettsr, Music, directs the dance
performance. They both learned about Javanese dance in
Hawaii, and have since both lived in Java.

In January, Val again visited Java, where she searches
for specific styles of costumes for the dancers. “They/re
extremely ornate,” said Val. ”Lots of beaded velvet and
tooled leather painted gold. There’s batik and colorful
scarves, and several of the performers wear masks or
ceremonial headwear."

Berti Jackson-Babel '01. plays the role of the monkey
Hanuman. "Each count has a speciﬁc movement,” she said
aboutthe dance style. ”It’s a very pretise movement, how
you move your toes and your ﬁngers and the way you tilt
your head.”

”It’s very slow and graceful," said Preeti Gupta '03, who
will be dancing in the ensemble for her third year, "It’s
more about being centered, being calm and serene, than
being flashy.”

”I’m learning something that’s so different from any oi
the other styles or dance he done," said Jackson-Babel.
"It’s veny difierent iron the general Western style of
dancing, irom ballet ur tap or even people just going out
and dancing at a party."

The music is highly percussive and sounds tar different
than most Western musical traditions. The music is
”meditative,” said Bea Menendez '04, who plays the
gambong, gang and bonong in her third semester with the
ensemble. “It’s aesthetically pleasing."

"Unlike oicliesira, or hand, or jazz band, the students
who come to me haven’t heard or grown up with this
musical tradition," said Vetter. ”So it's enculturating into
the musical tradition, and teaching repertoire. It’s like
learning a new language and all the social customs that
go along with the use of the language."

Though many students must adapt to an unfamiliar
musical language, the initial skills needed to perform are
minimal. ~The way the music is structured, it presents
roles that are relatively stmlghttonvard,” said Roger. ”Vou
can become involved in the overall enterprise, and as you
become more advanced, there are other instruments that
are more challenging.”

Val sees the pertonnance as an opportunity for both
performers and audience member. “For the dancers, it's a
wonderful opportunity to perform what theyve been
working hard on in the context of a dance drama, where
they take bn the roles of characters," she said. "For the
audience it's the opportunity to have a taste of Javanese
dance drama and a taste of Javanese culture, because it
reflects all kinds of cultural values that may not be
immediately discernable tn the uninitiated. With the
different styles, you get a sense of the Javanese
aesthetic." ‘
