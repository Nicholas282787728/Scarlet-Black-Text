S’rudenl Council
Survey Is S’rudied

Resuils lndicaie Lack
Of S+udeni Knowledge

Tabulation or the results of
questionnaires distributed at
housemeetings by the Student
Council indicates satisfaction
among the student body withthe
work of the Council but a lack of
understanding of the functions of
that organization.

The purpose of the questions
nairc was to soimd ~ouL student
opinion and to discover how much
students actually know about
their own student government.

Answers to the first question
“Do you feel your representation
is being expressed?” show a ratio
of 3 to 1 in the affirmative, while
almost half said that they do not
use other channels than the Slur
dent Council to air their views.

All 11 to 1 majority said that
they feel a Student Council is
necessary, but -in answering the
question “Would you be willing
to spend more time and energy
strengthening the Student Conn»
cilz" there was only a 4.8 to 1
ratio who said yes.

A “mite-one ratio said that
they did not feel that there was
adequate publication of the activ-
ities of the student Council in
the Scarlet and Black.

The question "Do you actually
know how the various functions
of your Student Council operate"
of your Student Council oper-
ate 7" was divided into three palm,
ties. The representation and func-
tion parts of the question were
answered by a ratio of 1 to 1.
Concerning the duties of the
council, a ratio of two to one
answered in the negative.

A ratio of 3 to 1 showed that
students have no basis for com-
paring other schools” student gDVr
ernments with Grimeil's, and 4
to I believe they could not speak
adequately about Grimleii’s stu-
dent council and government.

0f the students questioned a
ratio of 2.5 to 1 thought that
the Student council meetings
were open. ,
