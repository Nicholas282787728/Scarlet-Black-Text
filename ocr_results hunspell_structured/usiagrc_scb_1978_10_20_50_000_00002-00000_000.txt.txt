Republicans speak at Grinnell

by Eric Iit‘l'r)

First District Congressman Jim
Leach and [ellow Republican
Thomas Railsback of Illinois spoke
of the contributions of the
Republican minority to the 1978
legislative session at a gathering in
South Lounge Tuesday

Leach stated that the primary
Republican initiative is in holding
down government spending He
claims that the recently approved
tax cuts have incorporated many
aspects oi the hotly debated Roth
Kemp proposal which Leach's
opponent Dick Myers has charged
is inflationary. Leach argues that
with builtin spending restraints
the bill would not increase the
natiolial debt

LEACII CLAIMS, “The role of
the Republicans has been to bring
amendments to legislation which is
to be stamped by the majority."
citing his own amendment to
President Carter’s Civil Service
Reform Bill limIting the overall
size of the bureaucracy He
believes this amendment would
force some bureaucratic lunctions
to return to state and local
authorities.

Railsback stressed decentraliza-
tion of government He notes that
such diverse writers as liberal
journalist Michael Novak and cons
servative educator Peter Burger
argue that the federal government
has damaged such institutions as

churches. leimilics and volunteer
(li‘gani lions which act. as
"Iliediating structures between
the cllizen and the state He
suggests that institutions such as
mental h 1th centers and correc-
tional lac ties be controlled by the
community. and predicts that
economic s mulus In the form of
reductions oi capital gains taxes

Tom Rtiilsbaclz

would “provide permanent jobs
superior to the temporary €5an
ployment provided by public
works."

IN AN INTERVIEW before the
lecture. Leach said that the
progress in the Middle East and at
the SALT talks was the result oi
Carter’s return to Kissinger-era
tactics. “When Carter entered

oflice he proposed a 25 per cent
cutback in arms, This caused a
further delay In the negotiations
which the Soviets used to their
advantage Now \Vlth the return to
more moderate demands. progress
is being made. Also the strategy
in tlIcMiddleEasthas turned away
from'lhe lull-scale Geneva talks.
which Carter originally wanted. to
Kissinger's tactic of isolating two
parties in onetoVone negotiations.”

Leach answered his opponents
charge that the tuition tax credit
would harm public schools by
suggesting that the competition
might prove beneiicial. he deiends
his opposition to the establishment
of government support ior loans to
ccrops on the grounds that most
successful co-ops have been
developed from the ground up. He
voted against the oitice oi Con-
sumer Representation because it
would Increase concentration of
the federal bureaucracy. and
points out that he had prepared a
compromise measure which
placed a representative ior cone
sumer interests in different
governmental departments.

LEACH ALSO defends his
support for arch-conservative
Roller Jensen because the Iowa
delegation to the Senate is the most
liberal in the country and “I think
that. at this time. it we err, we
should err on the side of con
servatism.”
