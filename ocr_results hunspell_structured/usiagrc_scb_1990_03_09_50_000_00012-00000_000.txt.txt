Records at CO

By Gemld Honigstock

Many individual jumpers,
throwers, sprinters, and distance
runners, came together on one
indoor track in Cornell last
weekend at the Conference Meet
to produce a stirring pair of third
place finishes, and no less than
seven school records.

The women's team was led
by a series of record~brcaking
races by IoAnnc Sackett. After
placing second in the ISOOM in
a school record 4:56. Sackett
unerringly broke her own
records in the 1000M(3:07) and
600M(I:4l) with first and
second place finishes
respectively.

One person. however, does
not make a track team, and it
took the accumulation of points
in ones and twos which
eventually made the one point
difference between third, at 49
points, and the two-way tie for
fourth at 48 points shared by
Lawrence and Beloit. It was a
total team effort. Abby Green
competed for the first time in
the long jump, yet placed sixth,
then went on to place two better
the high jump. Missy Ebilz
threw the Shot over 18" farther
than ever before, breaking the
30' barrier.

In the sprints, Kate Peterson
won her heat of the 400M,
thereby placing sixth overall.
Speedy Amy Reinhart was very
near a school record in the SSM
as she ended up fourth.
Reinhart also run the 300M,
along with Jennifer Jones, and
scored there as well. Both
relays. the 4 X 400 and 4 X
200, ran solid races.

In the 25 lap 5K. Heidi
Freiburger ran a very strong
race, while Michelle Thompson
ran a personal best by no less
than 30 seconds. Thompson
also ran an all-out 800M, where
she was joined by Michelle
Borg.

performances were by Matt

Jeff Wilson and Kevin Tapp in
the triple jump. Tripp jumped a

Wilson jumped 2’ better than
before!

Meanwhile, Jonathan Lave
echoed Saint Andre‘s first place
by winning the 1500M,
although Davtd Hammond was
not far behind in third, setting a
new personal best by nearly a
second(4:02).

On the next day, Coe
unveiled an array of sprinters
who led their team to a
conference victory, 21 points
ahead of Grinnell‘s 85. Yet
Grinncll tracksters believed it
was their day, and the efforts of
such runners as Darren Young
(300M,400M). Chris Garman
(1000M), Dave Sheridan
(600M), David Hammond (5K),
and Jonathan Lave (800M) kept
the team in the hunt.

In their superlative races,
Young and Lave set school
records in the 300M (36.59) and
800M (1:57). Chris Garman
fought off sickness in exchange
for second in the 1000M, while
Dave Sheridan easily won his
heat of the 600M in 1:27 to
place ﬁfth.

One of the gutsiest
performances was by Doug
Cutchins in the 800M.
Although seeded in the ‘slow‘
heat. he took the early lead and
held off late surges by another
runner to win by a ‘forehead’.

Helped by strong relay
teams. the squad was happy
with the outcome of the meet,
all the while realizing that if a
few things had turned out
differently. the conference
trophy would be in Grinnell’s
possession.

Indoor track is all but
complete for the teams, but for l
Jonathan Lave, he will continue
as he has earned himself a trip
to Massachusetts and Indoor
Nationals for a chance to
compete in the 1500M with the
rest of the best.

The outdoor season holds a
new track and extra events
which make the future very
promising.

Men's Volleyball
Experience

Breaks 3rd
Place Habit

By Eben Erhard

After three weeks of
finishing third, the Grinnell
Experience men’s volleyball
team finally broke out of that
rut, winning its first tournament
ever last Saturday. The
loumamentat Graceland College
was the largest one so far this
year tor the Experience. with
twelve teams from Iowa,
Kansas, and Nebraska
competing,

In pool play Grinnell split
its games with Drake and Wu
and beat Graceland in both
games. This was good enough
for a number one seed going
into the playoffs.

After receiving a bye in the
quarterfinals, Grinnell met the

- tough Yard Apes team in the

semifinals. Strong backcourt
play during this match kept the
Experience in it as the other
learn consistently hit around its
blocks. Grinnell managed to
win the match in two games 15-
II, 15-12.

The next task was to beat
the hard»hitting Net Smoke
team from Nebraska. Grinnell
opened quickly jumping to a 10-
5 lead, but Net Smoke plodded
back, eventually taking the lead
11-10. From this point on out
it was all Grinnell as the team
went on to win 15-11, In the
second game Grinnell had a
somewhat easier time despite
the punishing hits by the Net
Smoke’s outside hitter winning
15-8. The match was won on
outstanding backcourt play by
Joel Shepherd and Bruce Nissen,
and by Nissen and Jon Pintcr‘s
ability to hit through the
opposition’s blocks.

With their first tournament
victory under its belt. the
Experience look forward to the
return of power hitter Nathan
Timm as it travels to Fort
Dodge this weekend.

Mad Dog Leads Swimmers to Conference Title

By Steve Clem

The Mad Dog made its debut
in the greatest way, leading the
Grinnell Men's Swim team to a
third straight victory at the
Midwest Conference Meet, For
the third straight year, the men
swimmers dominated the ﬁeld of
opponents while breaking the
Conference scoring record. The
Pioneers broke their own record
score from last year, scoring
734 points.

The records did not stop
there, however. Of the 20
events at Conference, 16 were
won by the Pioneers, more than
ever before. The Pioneers also
broke ll Conference records in
the Lawrence University pool.

The Mad Dog also helped tally
nine school records. The school
records included the 200 free
relay, the 200 medley relay, the
400 medley relay, the 100 and
200 butterﬂies, the 200 and 400
I.M.s, and the 100 and 200
breastrokcs. Record setters
included Dave Ressner. Mike
Nield, and Joe Zimsen, among
others. This years Conference
also included another first, as
the Pioneers won all five relay
events, which had never been
accomplished before.

Coach Ray Obcrmiller was
estatic over the outcome of the
meet. “Everyone on the team
had an all»time best
performance. Because there was
not one bad performance. I'd

have to say I couldn’t pick one
team member as the greatest
performer. I’d say it was the
whole damn team," commented
Obermiller, “It‘ll be hard to top
this one, but it will be so much
fun to try!"

The Pioneers also added two
more swimmers to accompany
diver Phil Bishop to the
National meet, though one of
the swimmers will be unable to
attend the meet for personal
reasons. Dave Rcssncr qualified
for the 200 fly with a time of
1:55.91. Rcssner is allowed to
enter any other individual events
upon qualification in one event.
so he will also compete in the
100 fly and 200 I.M, Bishop
has qualified in both the I-Mcter

and 3-Meter diving, and should
he win either event at nationals,
he could compete in the NCAA
Division I meet as well.
Bishop‘s highest finish in
Nationals was a third-place in
the 1988 meet. “Phil is diving
so consistanly well that it‘s all
up to luck on how he does at
Nationals. Ressner also has a
shot of placing in the top eight
in the 200 fly, which would
give him All-American status,"
Obermiller said of his hopes for
the National Meet. Rcssncr and
Bishop will compete from
March 14-17 in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.

Obermiller also
complimented the senior
swimmers who made their last

appearances at Conference. “It's
going to be hard to replace Lhe
leadership qualities of those
guys, let alone the talent they
brought the team. It will he a
big adjustment after four years
with that extremely mature
class." said Obcrmillcr.

Obcrmiller believes it is
impossible to predict the team‘s
outlook for next year. "I never
know what recruits we will have
in, or which team members will
stay with us. I know we’ll be
competitive, but many factors
will determine how
competitive." With Mad Dog on
their side, the Grinnell Men's
Swim team could be on the
verge of an even more
impressive era.
