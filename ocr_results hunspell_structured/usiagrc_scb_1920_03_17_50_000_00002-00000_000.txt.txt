There is, apparently, a growing ten-
dency on the port ol two broadly dis-
tingliislmd groups in this country to
ward hysteria in political and einoa
nomic thinking.

0n the one hand are the radicals
They are inade up, tor the most part.
ol ldealistlcﬁbeorists. and ignorant
social niisﬁts. The tormer ore too
tar from the actual conditions of the
world to realize the iinpractahility ol
theii prograins and the latter are too
ignorant and too selﬁsh.

0n the other hand are the ultra
conservative or the radical anual‘a’di-
They are the men who worship

at the shrine of tradition. They have
seen a red ilag on the horizon and like
the bulls oi Lhe Spanish arena have
lost control or their senses in blind
opposition to this strange phenomena
which seems to threaten those con-
’servative principles which are the
very hreath-oi their nostrils.

cals.

In justice to the radical group it
should be pointed out in passing that
the conservatives are not all altruistic
angels seeking the country's good from
ﬁrst to last Is it any more unfair to
say that the conservative ﬁghts the
radical in order to protect his property
rights than it is to say that the radical
would overthrow the existing order as
a means to get what he thinks is his
just share of this world's gouds?

Both Reds and antiaReds seem to
have discarded d‘easoh. its a result
the Reds look upon the rest or the
country as a capitalistic machine the
main object oi which is to keep every
thing tor itseli and crush them, the
uniortuiiatos, beneath its capitalistic
heel. 0n the other hand the belliger-
ent conservatives see nothing hut red.
In every liewhiskered restaurant
waiter they see a disciple or Russian
Nihilisin with honihs protruding {rum
his hip pockets and anarchistio lltél‘aa
ture stutted in the lining oi his coat.

The following quotation trom an
editorial_contained in the Ii‘ehrudry
numlier or the Grinnell Review brings

the matter home to the colleges of the .,

countr) :

“Among the public institutions that
have been receiving the beneﬁt of the

critical spirit or this decade is the .

college. Radical organs fill their edi-
torial pages with denunciations of
"this stronghold of capitalism" and
insist that American educators have
given their freedom ill exchange for
pitiful 5 lanes and are but “the tools
of the ruling class." Oh the other
hand, reactionaries are as loud in

their accusations that the colleges are '

the strongholds of menacing economic
theories and are “full of parlor

bolsheui " h
It is oul opinion that the United

States is i e up neither oi Reds nor
aliti»Reds out at reasonahly sane peo-
ple who can look with tolerance on
the radicais or both groups as long as
they do not carry ‘their'owu petty
squalihles too tar and who, in the long
run, know what they want and will
have it rcgardlcss oi the propaganda
or a misguided minority. I

Propaganda and the propagandist

are assuming increasing importance
in this country. In a‘recent editorial
the Chicago Tribune pointed DuL that
every man in public life now has his
press agent and that it requires all
the skill and alertness ot the city

the advertisements which come in una
