team finished its regular sea.
Son’s play this week by defeat»
ing Drake university and lowa
State Teachers college, and 105-
ing to lowa state college.

The three meets brought
Grinnell‘s season record to
seven wins against only two
losses. The only defeats were
at the hands of two Big
Seven conference Schools, Ne«
braska and Iowa State.

, Playing without the services I
of their number one man, BobI
Dibble, the Pioneers were push-l
ed to a close tour to three vic-l
tory over Drake last Friday.
Grinnell won the first tour
singles matches, but dropped
the number five singles and
both doubles matches. The meet
was held on the local courts.

On Saturday the Pioneer
netinen, with the aid of Dib~
ble, pasted a nine to nothing
victory on Iowa Teachers. in
a meet played at Cedar Falls.
Grinnell's Harry Young and
Fred Little breezed past their
opponents by identical, 6-0,
6-1. scores in the Tutor meet.

l

iowa State handed the v ng
Grinnell racketeers slim, 7. , de.
feat at Ames on Tuesday. The
once bea‘ten Cyclones branded
the Pioneers with their second
defeat of the year. The match,
went quite well for Grinnell
singles wise, as the Pioneers!
won tive of the eight matches,
including the first three. How.
ever, the Cyclones' triumphs in
all four doubles matches gave
them their seven to five victory.

by Stan writer i

Backed by six wins, one loss
record, Fritz Little entered con-l
ference singles tennis play this
morning on the Grinnell courts,

The number four men on 1
the team. Fritz started con.
ference play this season in the =
number five slot that he held I
as a sophomore, and worked .
up to the number four bcrth l
by mid-season.

Lntst year, Fritz was an ex3
change student in France which:
might acount for his slow start
this year in tennis 'since he]

didn’t play at all while he wasl
in Europe.

Tennis coach John Piitsch said
of Fritz’s playing this year.
“It’s the best of his life, much
better'than I expected.”

 

in his treshman year, Fritz,
now a Cowles Senior, won fresh—

_ ,_ﬁ __ V.._ﬁw-_

man numerals in tennis, and in
football where he played cen—
ter.

He gave up football in his
sophomore year but stayed
with tennis and took up swim-
ming, in tennis, Little took
to the courts against Beloit,
Drake, lowa state
Loras, University oi lows, and

Cornell. This p13 g netted
Fritz an Honor G in tennis.

Tomorrow Little teams up with
Harry Young in conference
doubles competition. With his
only loss, in singles play to
iowa State, Fritz has proven a
valuable asset as both a singles
and doubles man to a top ten-
nis team.

Fritz remarked that he went
to France "to study French

culture,” adding that history is‘

his major. We can’t quite see
the connection, but we're sure
there must he one.

and Fred Little—fourth singles.

Dibble is defending his con-
ierence singles championship
. oi two years standing, and on
the basis of his season record,
should be successful: He will
. have been pressed though, by

such outstanding players as
Bruce Ohmann oi Carleton,
and Carl Tippett oi Lawrence.

The other members of the Flo-
neer net team should have done
well, too. Harry Young hasn’t
been defeated this year, while
Hamilton and Little have very
impressive records. All four
