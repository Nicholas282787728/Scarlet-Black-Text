Hiring Injustice

To the Editor:

Recently, the mathematics and
computer science department intern
Viewed several candidates for two
tenure track positions. As a member
of the SEPC. I was able to particir
pate in the hiring process. I think that
it is commendable. and perhaps even
remarkable that Grinnell solicits stun
dent opinions and actively involves
us in the interviewing of potential
hires. However. after all was said and
done, I did not feel that the departr
inent had really listened to me or the
other students. We asked the departr
merit to hire a teacher, a woman, a
minority. Because right now, out of
ten permanent positions. only one is
ﬁlled by a woman, and because I am
the only woman math major in my
class. this request is more thanjustia
fled. Yet. despite the fact that the
SEPC found the African-American
Woman who interviewed to be the
best candidate. the department hired
a white man whose forte is research.

How did this happen? Grinnell's
philosophy emphasizes teaching. Ac-
cordingly, any department should be
trying to hire good teachers: that is.
teachers who can motivate and in-
spire their students. A teacher who
inspires will make a greater impresr
sion on more students than a teacher
who has published in several major
mathematics Journals, but lacks the
ability to spark enthusiasm in his/her
students. Understandably. our pro-
fessors are looking for a co-worker,
and therefore, the department has to
consider how the addition of a cer-
tain personality will affect depart-
ment dynamics. However, not hiring
a candidate based on the assumption
that the candidate will question the
way the department is structured
does a disservice to both the students
and the college. Doing so puts the

needs of the students second. and
prevents the change that students are
requesting.

Perhaps some people would like to
dispute the question of whether
change is needed on this campus,
After four years of discussing and
living it. 1 will tell you ycs. that air
though it is not the only one, the math
department needs to change. We
complain that there are not enough
women and minorities majoring in
the sciences, and some of our pron
fessors agree with us, Wc tell our
department that their curriculum
barely competes with other liberal
arts colleges, and some of our pro-
fessors agree with IIS. Yet nothing
changes. The departments offer the
same courses taught by the same
people and continue hiring other
PhD’s who are exactly like the meme
bers of the already established den
partment. Do they expect the result
to change when the method is invarie
ant? I am sick of waiting. I want
someone in the math faculty who is
like me. lfthat person rocks the boat,
if that person questions the every
decision of the department, if that
person makes a few people uncomr
fortable or even angry s all the heir
ier. If they feel uncomfortable and
angry that someone disagrees or does
not understand them, then I respond
that every day I am angry that people
disagree with me about the imporr
tance ofhaving a woman in the front
ofthe math classroom. I am tired of
hearing from my professors and felr
low (male) math students that they
know what it is like to be the only
woman in every math class, and to
have, out of 12 classes, one which
was taught by a woman. I am tired
of hearing that they understand and
agree with me and then watching
them take an action to keep the situe
ation exactly the same. This school
claims to be “liberal.” yet in this case,

its progressive politics are rhetoric
for the View books, I am asking for
recognition, support. and actions that
change the status quo, and while the
mathematics department is able to
address the issue of change on a glo-
bal level. it seems unable to recog
iiize that in order to change the world,
we will have to change the face of
our own department. Change will
only conic when everyone, espe-
cially the people in power, recogr
nizes that a problem exists and takes
action to fix that problem.

In less than three weeks I will
graduate from Grinnell, sol will not
see the department change Still, I
hope that in the future, the inathematr
ics department Will consider more
carefully how its decisions impact its
own majors, the college, and ulti-
mately. the rest of the world.

Cockring Confusion
Dear Scarlet and Black.

Please ask Mr. McGoldrick if he re-
ally knows what a cooking is. Ifhis
piece about piercing is any indica-
tion he is clueless. Sorry to be blunt
but after I saw those poor kids in
Pump Up the Volume asking “what’s
a cockring'l" I swore that I would
never let the world be ignorant about
something so uneccesarily taboo.

A cockring is just a band you put
around the base ofyour/his penis. If
you want a really snug fit it is ad—
Vised to throw the testicles in there
too. The purpose ofa cockring is to
“prolong erections." God made the
cock-ring simple and easy to use.
Nothing expesive or semi—permar
nent, just an erection that will last
until the cows come home. Good
citizens go out and buy cockrings!
Thejapancse style with the cute little
rubber draWeraps are the best in my
experience. Release yourselves from
this lack of knowledge and do not
be afraid anymore. No piercing, no
flacidity, and almost no money.

A taste of Scotland

BY DAVID REED
Guest Columnist

I thought I’d open my column with
a piece of little known Scottish cul-
ture. The name of this little known
Scottish culture is Irn Bru. Irn Bru
is the toprselling soda in Scotland
and many Scots consider it an
instituion. I was told, even though I
am not sure if
this is true, that
Irn Bru’s popur
larity makes
Scotland one
of the only na-
tions where
Coca Cola is
not the top
seller. Irn Bru
is everywhere.
What makes
this even more
interesting is
that no one out-
side of Scot-
land can really stand the stuff. The
company tried to sell it elsewhere,
but failed. A friend of mine described
the ﬂavor as, “orange soda with a lot
of funky herbs in it." I have also
heard it compared to Bazookka
bubble gum and to candy coins. it
has a truly indescribable ﬂavor that
I have come to adore. Irn Bru goes
on the list with haggis (sheep intes-
tines stuffed with whatever) as a truly
unique Scottish experience.

Another tnily Svottish experience
is the Scottish Highlands. The ma
jority ofScotland is made up oflarge
hills and mountains dotted with stnall
towns. The Scots have a law here

called “right of way" which states
that individuals have the right to
cross over other people‘s private
land. Thanks to this law. the best way
to see Scotland is to park your car.
take a map, a compass. rAingear (it
always rains in the Highlands), hop
a fence, and just start walking. It is
a common pastime as Scotland is full
of “rambling clubs." I belong to a
rambling club
called the
B reakaway
Society. The

us to Ben
Lawers. a
small moun-
tain next to
Loch Tay in
the High-
lands. The
group 1 was
with went on
a sever hour
trek up and
down five different peaks with Ben
Lawers in the middle. The group
walked, scrambled (climbing using
your hands), grunted and groaned
and had a wonderful time of it. In
the process we saw some breathtak-
ing scenery of the loch and the sur
rounding mountians. Scotland is a
beautiful country. Even if walking
is not really your thing. it iS worth it
just to drive around and take in the
mountains streams and lochs.‘ For
someone who is there as a tourist, it
is a very Scottish experience.
