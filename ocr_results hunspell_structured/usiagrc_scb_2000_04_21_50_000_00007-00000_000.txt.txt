(UrWIRE) Despite threats from
Nike that it will cancel contracts with
universities that join the Workers’
Rights Consortium (WRC), Colum-
bia is committed to the newly rounded
factory sorchdog group, administra.
tors said yesterday

Nike recenrly informed Brown Utria
versiry that it was terminating their lit

membership in rthRC, an organize»

Columbia, which Joined the WRC
in March, does not have a licensing
agreement with Nike, although Nike
does provide some Columbia athletic
teams with shoes and other apparel,
still, student aerrvrsrs said they were
concerned that other corporations
might follow Nike's lead.

Director of Business Services Bob
Moskovin did not discount the pussi»
hiliry that one of Columbia’s licensees
would decide to cancel its contract, but
he said the Universirywouid not recon.

cause ofsuch a decision,

“lftheydon'r trust us, then dney have

to do business with us," Moskovi rt said.
“We‘ll ﬁnd someone to replace them."

ber oirhe FLA since last spring.

But Moskovitz also said he saw no
reason {or corporations to cancel their
agreements due to WRC membership.
Calling Nike's decision both “very dis-
appointing" and “very premature,"
MOSkOVlIL said there is "nothing at this
point that’s threatening about the
WRC"

“Nike is correctethey aren’t on the
board and they won't be on the board,”
Moskovirz said. “It’s a different ap-
proaeh,.. Docs that mean there won‘t
be an important relationship with the
licensees? Ofcourse not."

Vice President for Public Affairs
Alan Stone, one ofthe lending admin-
istrators in the anti-sweatshop process,
said he expected licensees would accept
the WRC.

“l’m sure all of our licensees didn't
like the FLA," Stone said “Our general
policy wim our licensees has been to
engage them."

Moskovitz noted that, although the

said, will not need to change their stan—

But Michael Castleman '03 said he
was not surprised by Nikos actions. “I
think it goes to show the lengths that
companm will go to protect their in-
volvement in sweatshops," castleman
snld,

Chris Simoneau, director of Din»
ing Services, said it was notable that
Nike had decided to cancel its contract
with the relatively small Brown radier
than one orthe larger, more profitable
schools in the WRC, such as me Uni-
versity of \Visconsln. “i think Nike
probably did it to see what me reaction
would be," stinoneau said.

Casrlernan said he thought Nike
wanted to “d iseredir the WRC and scare
the schools without hurting themselves
too much."

But Mosltovirzsaid he maintains his
commitment to workingwith licensees,
“The relationship should not be
adversarial," Moskovltz said. “it should

said he would push (or more involve.

“IF that doesn't oceiir," Moskovitz

But both students and administra.
rors said they were encouraged by the
conference. Moskovitz said that while
“the details aren't there yet," especially
with regards to funding and the tenor

“very capable people" and “very promo

Trrular Head turns 24 today, and

event has changed tor the better or the
worse, all agree that the event will cons

The very ﬁrst Tltular Head festival
was held in 1976 in die form ofa series
orshort live skits performed in Darby
Gym. in the late 80s, the skits turned
into short films. Due to the growing
crowds, it was later moved to the Con-
cert Hall in the Harris Center. Due to
a poor institutional memory, no one
knows where exactly the name or the
festival, which is deﬁned as a “political
puppet”, originated rtom,

FFE awards to be announced soon
Osgood seeks feedback on preliminary announcement

By Michael Andersen
Staff Writer

“The point oiistuing [Fund for Excellence proposals]
in draft is to get people to share," said President Osgood or
this month’s memo that derailed proposals tor the third
year ofthe Funds operation. “This thing isn’t set in ce-
merit."

The Fund for Excellence, at special portion orcrinnell's
operating budget begun in recent years in an errorr to ex-
plore new programs tor the college, consists this year of
approximately $15.4 million set aside to experiment wim
proposals or students, faculty, and start, As it stands, ap-
proxlmately $5 million and 34 new programs have been
approved, with $5 million more going to continue carryover
commitments from previous years and the rest returning
to the fund as a safeguard for the future.

According to the president, who Will make the final
decisions on funding by April 28, “the fund musr promise
[0 address the followmg essential issucs: what should we do
to continue to attract and retain the best faculty who be»
lieve in a Grinnell liberal arts education and to attract, ma-
triculate, and graduate the ﬁnest students?"

The focus ofFFE programs, men, is usuallyshorr.rernr
pilot programs that would make way {or long-term opera—
tions, College programs that have received money from the
first two “rounds” ofthe Fund include the East Asian stud
ies concentration, the biochemistry major, the capstone cx»
perimenr, and the Faulconer Art Gallery displays, among
many others.

This year’s major proposals include a center tor the
Humanities, a Grinnell-in-WashingtonDC.pilot,t1"High

Winds Fund" iorcommuniryeconomie development, and
what Osgood calls “the biggest thing that's being endorsed";
a further Expansion or the college’s international studies
departments mat aims “to make international snidics a hall-
mark orour'ptogram."

Speaking ordiis last project Osgood glowingly described
“broad raculty support" and me involvement of“a tremen.
dous number oistudenrs." ”We should all embrace dais
program," he added in his memo.

Though “some were disappointed" by the preliminary
annouhcement or those proposals rejected this year, the
president believes that there were no truly diiricult calls to
make in terms ofwhich to fund, calling his decisions “unla
vetsaily clear—cut." He stresses, both in writing and in per»
son, the importance orprudence when allocating funds,

“The markets gone dowﬂiwl‘lat’s going to happen is
thattherond isgoingtostartshrinking.”explained Osgood.
“lfwc added all [the submitted proposals] up wed prob
ably exhaust the rund for the year,"

In the (more, added the president, he would like to in.-
riarc a “short ptc-ptoposal period" in which applicants rot
Fund moneys would send a paragraph to me president and
Executive council dﬁcnhlng meir proposal. This would
help to weed out those ideas that would be deemed unﬁt
for Fund programs. “A lot orroundations do pic-proposals
as a way orsaving people time and cirotr," he said.

Despite thee convictions, though, president Osgood
reminds the Grinnell community that he isstill waiting for
reactions to his tentative decisions. “One interesting rhlngi
I've heard more from students than rrom faculty [so rarl,"
he says. “People should email or call me,"
