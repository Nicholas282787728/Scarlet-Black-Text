PUDD NH D WILSON.

The chresto-Ellis Play Given Success-
fully—A Crowded House to
witness Performance.

The curtain rose to a'croivdcd
house at the time set for the per
formance of Pudd‘nhead \Vilson
at the Colonial last evening. The
support given the students by the
tou'nspenp‘e was very gratifying.
The societies paid a much larger

price than is usual, for the right,

to produce the play. but this was
fully justiﬁed by the interest
evinced in its production by towns.
people and students alike.

Pudd’nhead \‘Vilson is one of
the strongest and best plays on
the American stage to-day, and
is well suited to the demands of a
Grinnell audience. It is clean
andwliolesome and bearstlirough-
out lire stamp 01 meg healthy
genial humor for which Marl:
Twain is tanrous. it portrays a
true type of life,a type that is-
thoroughly American. The scene
is laid in the South and the story
brings before us a picture of that
social life and spirit of the south-
ern states in the antebellum days.
which has passed completely out
ofAnierican society with the pass
ing of slavery.

The production 01 the play by
the Chi-esto-Ellis societies was
carried out in a very creditable
manner. The cast had drilled
long and faithfully under the ef-
ﬁcient leadership of Miss Smith,
The attention of the audience was
held from the beginningtothe end
of the play, although it required
overthree hoursto gothrough with
it. The interest was naturally
centered in Pudd'nliead to a large
degree. ML Mcade reproduced
the spirit or the original well.
Mi s Inez Smith seemed especial-
ly well suited to tlle character of
Roxy. Both Roxy and I’udd’n»
head received ovations from the
audience. Sherrrt Blake, rcpl'er
sented by ll. D. l-lutchins was a
favorite with the audience. and
Delbert Dunn in the role of Col.
Campbell. one or the wise men or

The complete cast of characters,
with the exception of some of the
jury, was as follows:

RECEPTloN To PRESIDENT.

annnell Alumni hold Reception in honor
oiPresidentrelcct Bradley 7Visikan
Enjoyable one.

From the student point of view
the visit of Dr. Bradley just closed

has been entirely satisfactory.

cryone was glad to be able to

e. end to him a Cordial hand of

welcome and to meet him person
ally even if it were but rota mo
ment. He enters into the life and
spirit here with a Vim and sympa-
thy that leaves no doubt in any—
one's mind as to what the result
of his connection with the/institu-
tion will be.

The reception tendered him on
Wednesday evening at the home
of Miss Mary Chamberlain for
allimni'and Seniors was a most enr
joyable event. The reception
't‘uoms were ﬁlled during the entire
evening from seven to eleven. At
the departure of the Seniors Mr.
Bradley was given an enthusiastic
cheering. Thursday morning he
went to Des Moines, returning to
Grinnell in the afternoon. The
christian association meetings in
the evening were turned into a gen-
eral meeting in the chapel and con-
drrcted by Dr. Bradley. At the
close of the meeting those present
adjourned to Institute hall where
an irrrorrnal reception was held to
give the under -classmen an oppor-
tunity of meeting their president-
elect. This gathering was of an
extremely sociable character and
much college enthusiasm was in
evidence. The hall was ﬁlled by
the assembled students.

The Friday morning exercises
were in charge of Dr. Bradley and
he spoke to a crowded chapel.
During the afternoon his time was
occupied bycxeclitivescssionsand
faculty meeting. In the evening
he attended the Chrcstolﬂllis pre
sentation of “l’udd'nhend Wilson"
at the Colonial.

Much to everyo . regret his
duties call him back to Michigan
and he was forced to leave this
morning. lle will preach in Evan-
ston tomorrow, arriving in Grand
Rapids on Monday. President
Bradley’s Visithas beenproductive
or much good. A very warm
reeling now exists in the hearts of
all for the man who a short linle
ago was unknown to them.

Tuesday.

In order to acquaint the public
with the nature or the Slayton

has been thought advisable to

by them. A glance at it is sufﬁ
lt

extremely difﬁcult to say any

cient to prove its merits. is

thing in praise of ﬁnished artists,
lest the words sound fulsorne, but
judging lrorn the press notices

and-expressionsotplcasurevoiccd
by those who have heard them
either collectively or indiviclrrally
leaves no room to doubt the high
standard maintained by them.

Patrons of the lecture course
arc retiriiided that rlre concert is
to he held in the Colonial Theatre
instead of the church. It has
been thought best to continue
the system oi number drawing so
that the unpleasant features con-
nected with a recent seat sale
may not be repeated. The hours
tor drawing numbers are from r to
5 Monday aitcrnoon at the Colon-
ial box ofﬁce. Seats reserved on
Tuesday afternoon at l:3o at the

Y. M. c, A, BENEFIT To BE HELD.

Plan Proposed ror Raising the Associa—
tion Debt.7Miss Smith and Miss
Holden to Read.

The Young;r Men's Christian ASA
socizition is considerably in debt.
For this reason itis impossible
for the association to undertake
certain obligations which should
be met. This debt is not a large
one and yet it will not for some
time be paid by the oltlillary
revenues. In order that this debt
may be dissolved it has been
thought best to give a Y. M. C. A.
Beneﬁt and March trventysecondI
the Saturday evening after the
Glee Club Concert has been se-
cured for this purpose.

The entertainment which has
been planned will combine a very
interesting program with a pleas-
ant social event. From seven
‘tllirLy in nine a program consist-
ing or' select musical numbers and
several Shaltesperian readings by
Misses Glenna Smith and Helen
Bates Holden, will be rend»
ered in chapel. At n i n e
o’clock the society halls will
be opened and the remainder
of the evening will be devoted to
an informal social with a number
of attractive features. The social
is open to everyone. Candy
booths will be well supplied with
Leaniztn's candies and an orches—
tra will make Cozy corners doubly
delightiul. _

The admission to the evening's
entertainment will be twentyrﬁve
cents and it is hoped that every
sent in the Chapel will be sold.
Tickets will bi: placed in the hands
of the members of the Y. M. C. A.
next Thursday evening.

It is expected that every Stu-

dent in the college will be present
and ass. in making this y. M. C.
A, Beneﬁla social as well asa
ﬁnancial success.

Miss Smith needs no word of
commendation to the students as
she is already a great favorite.
Miss Holden will be heard for the
ﬁrst time in Grinncll on this oc—
casion. The Shakespeiian scenes
which will be presented will be of
particular interest. Misses Smith
and Holden have appeared in
these scenes before but not be-
folc a Grinnell audience.

The musical numbers which
will be presented will be ot more
than usual interest. This enters
tainment is one that no student
can afford to miss.
