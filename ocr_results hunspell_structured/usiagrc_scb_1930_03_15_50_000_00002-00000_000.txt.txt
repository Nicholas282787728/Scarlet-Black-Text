FOR mosmmsmn EXAMS.

Shortly following the midsemester examinations
of last semester. there appeared in this column on edi-
torial urging an extension of the period allowed for
cxams given in the middle of the term. Briefly, the
argument was: ﬁrst, that many Students who had four
exams on the same day found difficulty after review—
ing all four subjects the some evening in keeping the
information from being muddled in their minds, and
second, that after having written three exams, students
became tired and were not able to do their best work
on the last subject.

As a. remedy of this crowding of exams, it was
suggested that the exam schedule be made to include
four days with eight-twenty and nine-twenty” exams on
Tuesday, and Wednesday, and with ten-twenties and
eleven»twenties on Thursday and Friday. Exams for
classes scheduled in the afternoon only would be given
at their regular periods.

Such a. change seems especially valid this year be
cause of the greater crowding of classes into ﬁve days
due to the no-Snturdsy—class schedule. This causes
more than ever the scheduling of classes on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday for which classes the exams
Come on the same day, under the present; system.
Furthermore, the day on which those exams fall is the
last before the two recesses. Thsnksgiving and spring.
Work on these special days is not as easy as it would
be earlier in the week.

A two-day extension of exams would not detract
from class time for exam Week, Classes would go on
as usual, and with only one or two exams each day to
review for, students would ﬁnd ample time for study—
ing other assigned class work. Finally, mid-semester
exams are peculiarly important because of the fact that
grades are passed out at this quarterly period and are
kept on record in the college ﬁles.

again like to suggest this plan as one which would aid
the students in the closlng of the quarlor's work with
tho highest grades posslhlc and the better review of
the ninc week's work thnt they have just gone over.

TRAINING For: INTERNATIONALISM.

Alternating periods of flopl . ion and re~
joiclng havc been the notes of the London
naval conference sounded in the papers for the last six
or seven weeks. AL one moment, there seems to be
some solution on the horizon for the multitude of prob-
lems which face like delegates of the powers of the
world, and at the next some new Mill deeper problem
exists a period of depression over the entire conference.

During; rule past Week, the monkey-wrench which
found its Way into the works was cast by the United
States when Secretary Stimson refused on the part of
the United States a consultation pact offered by the
French government and upon which was based the
French plan for decreasing of armament, This refusal
on the part of the United States seemed for the time
to be the last straw of he conference .

The refusal was based for the most part on [lie
Lime-honored and almost outworn policy instituted by
President Monroe in 1823 which was to keep the United
State out of any “obligations of honor” with other ml-
lions of thc world. The many objections to such 7:.
policy which havc sprung up since the inception of the
policy and especially since the \Vorld war hardly need
to be cnumerated ncc they have appcorcd many times
in the lending periodicals in the country. Let it suffice
that it seems thaL the United Stones has outgrown such
a policy and has to get into better cooperation with the
other nations of the world in order to secure the much
tallied of world peace.

Where is instruction and agitation for better co-
operation and stronger sentiments for intel‘naltionalism
to begin? An editorial appearing recently in the Balti-
more Sun pointed out the possibilities of establishing
in the high schools courses in “world mindedness" but
at the same time showed the difficulties of instilling in
the minds of younger students such ideals and concepts
as are necessary for a feeling of internationallsm. It
then introduced the fcasabiliiy of opening classes for
the adult members of our society in evening schools,
There wss, however, little mention of the college and
university as a. plsce to get this international spirit,

These institutions of higher learning, however, seem
to be the logical place for the development of the
“world mind.” Already there are evidences of this
fact in relation to the present disarmament conference.
Quite recently, students of three of the nation's leading
universities have shown their appreciaion of the pos—
sibilities of World peace and their interest in forward-
ing the cause. The Harvard Liberal club in collabora-
tion with the Radcliffe college International club sent
to President Hoover a petition for disarmament con-
taining the names of 765 students, and a group of 300
students from Yale university sent a similar petition.

It is not necessary to introduce courses of training
for “world mindedness” into the college curriculum to
bring such an attitude before the minds of the students.
With studies moving to international significance in
economics, political science, history, .the sciences, and in
fact, in all courses, a simple correlation of these Studies
should lead to an interest in international affairs and
the realization of the necessity of ell-operation of the
powers of the world. The tempering of such informa-
tion with reading in periodicals and thought on the
problems of World affairs will lead College men and
women to the forefront in the solution of the problems
of international relations and the easier settlement of
the problems as now face the nations in the Naval

“By improvement in tho standards
of hygiene in Porto Rico, even the
stature of the natives is being in
creased," said Dr. D. F, Parish in a
tall: on “Education in Porto Rico" at.
a meeting of the Cosmopolitan club
Inst Tuesday evening. Dr, Parish
based his talk upon his own observa»
tions which he made during a stay
on the island.

”W'llile the island
schools, the teachers are not well
equipped," said Dr. Parish. “Many
of them are needy girls who have
had little training The children
liavc no home Lralning‘ before they
start to school. They usually have-
n'L the slightest Conception of what
a symbol of the alphabet looks llke."

While Eng sh is tlle official lan-
guage of the island. the children do
not start to learn it until they are
five or six years old. In the fifth
grade, it becomes is regular study,
and from that time on is used cx—
tenslvely.

The population is composed of a
mixture of Spaniards, Negros, In-
dians, and native Porto Ricans.
There is a definite class feeling, With
the pure Spanish at the top of the
social ladder. Democracy is en~
couragcd on the playgrounds and in
schools, but the minute that. the
children leave these, rivalry and
class fccling is evident.

The standards of hygiene
greatly improved, Malaria,

ing overcome, The children are
much more alert. Girls, especially,
are taught cleanliness, A hospital in
San Juan is fitted with the most
scientific equipment. Doctors from
the universities of Spain and schools
of the United States go there to
specialize.

Speaking of the cc‘cnomics of the
island, Dr. Parish said that the
country had been downtrodden first
by Lhe Spanish, and more recently by
American financiers. The output. of
agriculture, the chief industry, is bar
ing increased by tunnelling through
the mountains in order to carry sur-
plus water from the north side to ir—
rigate the scum.
