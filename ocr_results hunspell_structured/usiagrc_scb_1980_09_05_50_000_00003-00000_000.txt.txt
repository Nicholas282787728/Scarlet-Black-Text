On July i. 1978 the legal drinking age

'l'om Kozal, that change did not hurt
Pub proiits as was expected and
resulted in El "mellower crowd."

class lappi-oXimately 400 studentsl was
under age. Despite this drop in poten-
tial Pub membership. the actual
number 01 memberships sold increased
lroni about 675 to about 750, Kozal at-
tributes this increase to the growing
popularity oi alcohol in general and to
the growing popularity oi the Pub in
particular.

Vi. hile the change in drinking age has
not cut into Put) busmess, it has had a

The only problem resulting {mm the
new law was a shortlived student
resentment oi the change. Kozal noted
that many ireshmen had anticipated a
lower drinking age when they applied to
Grinnell Hence, Kozal - continued,
during the 1978779 academic year
students were disappointed that the age
limit was so strictly eniorced and they
were prohibited Irom patronizmg the
Pub,

Since the 1311 ot 1979, however,
students have come to accept the law
and carding at the door continues, but
with lower problems, As Kozal said,
"People seem to respect the law now "

Despite profit gains and less
rowdiness, Kozal regrets that treshmen
are no longer allowed to use the Pub [or
a place to meet and socialize with other
students, particularly upperclassmen.
In his opinion "Anyone who is 18 is
