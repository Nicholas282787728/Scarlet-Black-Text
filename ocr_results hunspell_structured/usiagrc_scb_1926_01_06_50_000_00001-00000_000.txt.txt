Preseason G: l'ith Siioiig Fire at

By cutting its vacation in half and
assembling on last Wednesday the
basketball squad has put in a full
week of extra hard practice in order to
get into shape for thc coining confei»
ence schedule. Thirteen men l‘elmrte
ed to Coach Black and since that time
have been wor ng overtime in an of»
fort to develop a winning Combimlv
tion.

A preseason game has been schedule
uled for this coming Saturday with
the Hillyards at 'St, Joseph, Mo, The
latter team is composed of former
college and independent stars and is
one of the fastest quintets in the mid»
dlewest. This gan'ie will be a real
test of the Pioneer's ability and
should put them in good shape for the
opening Valley game with Kansas U
at Lawrence on the fourteenth of the
month.

Wing Holds Gum-i1 Yositioll

Capt, Wing seems to be holding a
grip on his favorite guard position
with Niblo, Peterson, Mark, pedcrson
alternauog at the other side. Moran.
last year's scoring ace is being
groomed for a center position along
with Davis of last year's freshmen
out ’ Eoth at these boys seem to
work nicely at pivot and should add
greatly to the offensive power 01 the
team. Seeland and Bradstreet are
butting up a fight for the center job
and both have shown possibilities
that will most likely warrant some
action.

Peterson and Mark have both been
doing double service at guard and
forward. Macy and Hays have been
working as guards during the past
week and Struble is playing at for—
ward.

Black Shifts Men

It is impossible to say at this stage
of the game just who well compose
the first five as Coach Black is shift-
ing his men around and his best com:
bination will not be known until this
week's game. d

This years schedule will bring the
Scarlet and Black against the best
teams in the valley, and the Pioneers
should make it tough going for all of
them, as their defense is being train-
ed to stop some of the agile tossers in
the nearby states.

"Go forward!” was the keynote of

ished his listeners to go through such
periods of depression and still go on.

President . ain said that once in a
while devils ieered-at him as they did
at Martin Luther but that in this day

Russell Smith, '23, Emerson Schill,
'23, and Loren Reid, '9", have been
selected to debate Knox college of
Gaiesburg, Illinois, at Grinneil :Friday
evening 0! this week. Grinnell will
uphold the affirmative of the proposi-
tion, “Resolved, that the united States
should subsidize its commercial air
fleet."

Knox is one of the strongest teams
on the year‘s schedule, and the de-
bate should be a very interesting one.
Michael Ramsey, captain of the Cain-
bridge team which met Grinneli on
the question of 'science vs. arts and
humanities" a few weeks ago, stated
that Knox was one of the best teams
on their schedule. The lllinois
school has always sent a strong team
to Grinnell in the past and Coach
Shaw's men can be expected to put
up a strong arguinan

The men representing Grinnel'l. have
all bad considerablc debating expei‘v
ience. Smith made the varsity squad
last year, taking part in several in—
tercollegiate debates, and was a mem-
ber of the team that met Cambridge
in November. Schiil made his first
appearance on a Grinnsll platfol'm'as
a member of the Building Four team
which won the Merrill prize on the
question of the creation of a depart-
ment of the air. Reid has also weathv
cred intercollegiate mixes, making the
varsity squad last year.

The debate will be of the popular
no~decisi0u type, but after the session
the audience may ask any question
of the debaters regarding the propos~
ition. It will be held in the A. R. H.
auditorium, starting at 7:30.

on next: Thursday, January 14, a
negative team representing Grinnell
will iourney to Galesburg to meet
Knox on the same question. The mem—
bers of this team have not been an-
nounced yet.

Malteaser Scandals to
Be Presented In April

The Maltcaser Scandals of 1926 are
now being planned and will be pre—
sented some time in April.

Several are expected to collaborate
in the writing of the songs and skits
for this year's scandals, Among
those who will contribute are Loren
Reid, Emil Bilharz, George Deilll,
Fred Jarvis and Lewis Williston.

The Scandals of 525 directed by
John McGee were successful hut it
is expected to be an enlarged affair
again this year.

Bui‘l‘lette Plot ,’24, and Leonard
Winters, '25, both of Omaha, were in

T LK FESTIVALS TO TAKE PLACE
OF THURSDAY NIGHT YMEETINGS

 

Thursday night will mark the be-
giiming cf Criiiuell's all college talk
festival, the new method for stuv
dent discussion of Grililiell campus
problems. The plan is a novcl one,
being presented by a general student
committee composed of both students
and faculty and might be called an
out growth or an aftermath of the
State Student Convention held in Des
Moines, November 12, 13, it, and 15.

The meetings will be held in the
Associations building on Thursday
night, the regular meetings of the
Y. M. c. A. and Y. \i'. C, A. being tem-
porarily adjourned in cooperation
with the new plan The length of the
meetings will be the same as that of
the Y meetings, starting at seven
o'clock and continuing for one hour.

“in lteuicdy 01d Defects

in planning the new idea, the com-
iuittce has endeavored to meet and
remedy all the defects of the old ‘dis-
cussion gi'oup‘ plan. in order that
athletics may be discussed without
boring the would-be poet or the Grcek
student, four different groups will be
held at the same time and each stud-
ent may attend the one in which he is
iniist interested.

ax Howarth will lead a discussion
on, "Athletics and Their Relation to
the Curriculum," a problem especial—
ly designed for those of athletic tcud-
eucies.
Discuss View oi Life

Dean Eindlay's group will examine

the problem, "Does College Strength-

eii or Weaken Dne‘s View of Life?" a
discussion which promises to provoke
much thought and interest

Augusta Towucr will be in charge
of the group discussing, “\l‘liat Don't
You Like About Your College
Education?" This subject is expected
to provide a harbor for many not
hooves.

'fbc fourth group led by Rex 1le
gram will debate the “Adequacy of
the social program on the Grinncli
Campus?” another vital problcm on
which many students have expressed
themselves in the past,

These four groups will all nicct at
the same time in different parts of
the Y building and will be melting
pots for at least fcur types of come
pus problems All members of the
Grinnell student body and faculty are
urged to come. .

Hope to Beach Conclusions

The idea of these so called 'taik
tests is to come to some conclusion on
the subjects, a point that the old dis
cussion groups seldom reached The
purpose is not merely to chew the rag,
but to make progress and to arrive
some place. Furthermore, when the
conclusion or conclusions are reach-
ed, they will bo presented to the prop
or authorities with the view of mak-
ing the desirable changes.

The. talk fests will provide ample
opportunity for all students to express
themselves for the purpose of really
remedying campus evils instead of
merely acknowledging them.

 

Marquette Will
Be Pioneer Foe

"Golden \anmiclie" i Aililed (0 Grill‘
C N for Next Season its llli

Intersect ionul Gillne.

An intersectional football game
with Marquette University of Mil-
waukee has been scheduled for Octov
ber El next season. This announce-
ment was made during the holiday;
vacation when the arrangements were
completed.

The Marquette gridstcrs, known
throughout the sports world as the
“Golden Avalanche" team, have a
high national rating on the gridiron.'
Their record the past five years has
been most imposing and last year,
they succeeded in placing Captain Dil-
weg, stellar end, on numerable All-
American first teams.

The game will be played in Mil-
waukee, probably before Grinnell
starts the Missouri Valley season. The
schedule is not complete at this time
but will be ready for announcement
in the near future. No definite ar-
rangements have been made in regard
to a game on the Pacific coast,, but
it is doubtful whether such a game
win he played.

Last season the Marquette eleven
met one of the strongest teams in the
Missouri Valley, the Kansas Aggies, in
a great battle which resulted in a 3~
3 tie. Next year the two teams will
vie again in an effort to determine
the real gridiron supremacy.

Wilma Thompson Takes
Main Role in “Rain”

Wilma Thompson, '23, temporarily
took over Jeanne Eagles' role in
“Rain" which has been playing in
Chicago for the last three weeks.

Miss Thompson had been under-
study tor Miss Eagles for some time
and is the first after Miss Eagles to
play the part of “Sadie Thompson."

While in Grinnell Wilma Thompson
was prominent in dramatios. one of
the most outstanding productions in
which she appeared was Eugene
O'Neill's “Beyond the Horizon."

“Rain" had a long run in New York
and was expected to be in Chicago for
a year but it is rumored that small
houses will cause the management to
terminate the run soon.

Count de Prorok Will
Deliver Next Lecture

The next number on the lecture
course will ho a lecture delivered in
Herrick chapel by Count Byron Kuhn
de Pi‘m‘ok. the famous ex lorer, on
Janua y 21. His lecture is of unus—
ual intciest heightened by the fact
that he hits just returned from Carth-
age, the scene of his most recent and

To Hold ’J'i' Iih‘ Tul‘adil)’.

The first open meeting of the Grin-
nell forensic, the newly organized
successor of the men’s literary so-
cieties, which was held just before the
Christmas recess, was enthusiastically
received by the students and faculty
present.

James Work. president of the organ-

,izatiou, presided at the meeting and

told briefly of the formation of the
society. Professor J. P. Ryan of the
department of speech then presented
the Merill debate awards to Emerson
Schill of Four, Laurence Pedei‘sen of
Langan and Eugene Woodruff of
Smith, whose teams won first, second
and third respectively in the Merill
series.

Loren Reid, vice—ni‘esident, spoke of
the plans of the Forensic and explain-
ed the method of try-out.

An open forum discussion on "Car
education" was then held, Work pre-
siding, which lasted about twenty
minutes and became quite animated.
This particular topic was suggested
by one of the Cambridge debaters at
the time of their visit, it appearing
to bc a vital topic in British forensic
circles,

Try-outs for member a p in the
Forensic will start next Tuesday,
January 12 at 7:30 P. M. in the A. R.
id. auditorium. At that time a short
memorized selection, of not over four
minutes, will beigiven. Later on brief
impromptu speeches will be made by
the tryouters, and from these tryouts
the members will be chosen.

Those who attended the first open
meeting are optimistic over the fu-
ture of the Grinnell Forensic. W. Earl
Beem, ol the department of speech,
stated that “The new organization is
fulfilling the neeed of the old literary
societies plus an additional need of
developing the speaking ability olall
men on the campus rather than the
few." other faculty members who
were present as well as the men them-
selves' were highly pleased with the
first open meeting.

Faguy-Cote Will Give

"in spite of the fact that thc con-
fcrencc was conceived and managed
by students, it was done well," com-
mcnted Frank Dewey concerning the
national college conference on the
world court, which was held at
Princeton university and which he
attended as Griuueu's undergraduate
representative.

According to Dewey, the greatest
significance of the conference did
not lie in any concreic action which
it took important as that action was
a it in tho complete control of af-
fa s which the students themselves
exercised. There were no professional
loaders of youth movements present.
and on every occasion except one, stu-
dcuts presided over the conference
sessions. in that particular case, a
professor in the Princeton Theolog—
lcnl Seminary had charge of, but did
not participate in, the open forum dis
cussion.

lndcpt-udiuit in .ittitiulo

So determined were the delegates in
their independent attitude that when
the presideiit of th College of the
City of New York vetoed the action of
his student council in appointing a
representative who opposed comniilv
sory military training in colleges, the
conference voted to accept that rep—
resentative's credentials nonetheless.
At another time, a measure providing
for a'pcrmanent union of American
college students was passed with what
many delegates considered insuffic-
ient discussion. The chairman of the
conference, who had not been presid-
ing at the time, immediately reopened
the whole matter, saying that they
would not adjourn until one o'clock in
the morning rather than ‘i'ailrbud' a
motion through the meeting, His
statement was rather borne out i'ztths
er literally, because that session did
not break up until after midnight,

Representatives from to colleges
and universities attended the Prince-
ton conference, and about 1500 people
heard President Hibben open the con-
vention, including local students and
voting and fraternal delegates. United
States Senator lrvinc L. Lenroot of
Wisconsin, and Clarence Dari-ow, the
famous Chicago criminal lawyer, en»
gagcd in a debate concerning the mere
its of the World Court, 'Seuator Leli~
root advocating American adherence

posing such adherence. Herbert
Houston, President of the Interna-
tional Chambcr of Commerce, and
George R. Vincent, president of the
Rockefeller Foundation, were other
speakers, both dwelling on the res
lation of the United States to world
affair Erank Dewey stated that
Mr. Vincent was the oiitstandiug fig-
ure of the conference and expressed
a hope that Crinncll bight have an
opportunity to hear him at some timc
iu the future.

Draw Lip Resolution

The results of the conference are
summed up in a resolution which was
passcd with but few dissenting votes:
“Be it resolved that we advocate to
the President and Senate of our coun-
try, adherence to the Permanent
Court of international Justice under
the sarcalled Hal'llilig-Hllgbes-Coole
