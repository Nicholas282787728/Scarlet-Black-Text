Athletes'
Feat

Now that I’ve blown off steam
in an attempt to establish
where the sports department
stands regarding school ath<
letics a and have gotten’that
out of the way — l’ll step back
in line with the weekly hap<
penings.

First, a word or two of
congratulations to the swim
team for its impressive 20
point victory at, Gustavus last
week _ and special mention
of the 400 yard medley relay
team which broke the Min-
nesota school‘s pool record
in 4:25, and to Dean Cracker
who swam the zoo yard breast
stroke in 2:365 — close to
two seconds faster than the
present Midwest Conference
record for that event.

As long as I’m on a swim-
ming note 7 might mention that
the conference meet is scheduled
for here this year, The prelim.
inaries will be held Friday night,
March first, and the finals sat-
urday afternoon, the second.

The seating capacity for our ‘
“sink" is a vast 190. By the
time the members of the seven
participating teams, the officials,
coaches, and managers receive
their allotment of tickets there
should be enough room for one
person from each hal_l.

The ducats will be given,
free, by Irv Simone on a first
come first serve basis late this
month. So _ to those of you
who might he interested in
seeing one of the greatest con-
ference meets in Midwest
history I’d suggest keeping an
eye and ear open for con—

cerning announcements.

Heard that a couple first year
grapplers stole the show against
Augustana last Saturday. Dave
Van Anrooy, a scholastic sopha»
more complying with conference
rules that demand of transfers
a year of freshman participa-
tion, displayed a world of class
in pinning Augustano's 167
pounder, .

Reason for the good show-
ing?? I’d guess that, it's “Van’s"
background 7 two years vars~
iiy at New Trier high School
in lllinois and a year at Illi-
nois university.

. The other boy that I had in
minrl is Roy Simpson. The
Davenport freshman injured
his shoulder earlier in the
season, but lowered the boom
on an Augustana varsity man
Saturday. Simpson beat John
Calamus 2-0. Here's hoping
that the two will holster
"Pete's" lineup next year,
making lor a brighter outlook.
We can't count. the wrestlers
short yet, however. Our duel .
meet season wasn’t great last
year either 7 yet the squad
walked off with runner~up hon-
ors in the conference meet (to
he held this year, by the way,
at Coe on the weekend of March
1 and 2,) You that have trans-
portation availableﬁCoe, which
is in Cedar Rapids, is only an
