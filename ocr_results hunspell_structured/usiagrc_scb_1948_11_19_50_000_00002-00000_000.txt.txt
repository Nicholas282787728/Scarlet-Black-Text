The Spirit’s the Thing

Someday, tlle atomic bomb and premature
arteriosclerosis permitting, the majority of the
people now running around on campus in bobby-
sox and turnedeup trousers will be old, even to
the grandparent stage, “I remember when
.- . . ” they will be saying, according to the tray
dltlonal tactics of the aged.

And what then, cllilluns. Will be the things
about your SO-Called career iil college that stand
out like bumps iil your ,memo V? In our opinion
it will be certain extra extrl-curricular events.
Maybe the time Professor Whatsis read Virgil
like a Latin fireball; the day they finally
laid a concrete sidewalk between ARH
and the bookstore; the time s o in re
natty politicos got ‘up a new song about their
dark horse candidate and roused all,the fresh»
men from bed by singing it to the tune of
“Bridget O‘Flynn" on Main steps at midnight;
or the time when yoll couldn‘t walk from one
end of the campus to the other without the aid
of loudspeakers blaring “Get on the ball With

Moll . . . ” ‘ ,
As long as that over-publicized and under-

___—_’—._————

practiced thing called school ”spirit” has never
been adequately defined anyway (not even in
Klausner’s adv‘ iced philosophy courses), ue
won't got into it here. Suffice to say that In
our opinion this year’s crop of freshmen has
adequately scotched ugly rumors that Griliaell
\\ill soon be tulningr into an idle rich man’s
hostelry, by showing plenty of “spirit" and stuff
like tllct there. Vitality is a good old hard
“iol'klllg‘ early American shirtsleeve trait, after
a l,

Vitali v began to hit old alma mater in a
big way again when this year's north campus
freshmen turned out for prepping, looking: dove
ilishly like women, in non-matching s rts,
blouses, purses, and perfume; when south cam»

‘ pus lgrceilllorns, inspired by the example of the
stronger se ‘, followed along in pigtails and out-
landish get-lips (despite a rumor that fresh»
women in a body were going to rebel against
prepping, which soon-damped manuever display-
ed a vitality of its own);when, after a bang-up
election, preps allegedly ,voted in the class presi-
dential candidate with the most unpronouncable
name.

Even some of the vets are beginning to wish
that they had gotten a little more of the ”spirit”
wliell they came back from the army, weary and
in need of refreshment. Preps are just carrying
over rah-rah from high-school you say? Maybe.
But what do you bet that they make vivacious
grandparents? After all, you‘re only alive once.

Sand to Supervision

An Excess of Spirit .7

Once again fall prepping fades into the past,
and freshmen the campus over draw sighs of re,
lief as they mull over memories, fond or othe‘s
wise, of the recent ordeal. Some question e v
ists, however, as to the degree of fondness with
which the preps of Dibble and Rawson regard
their most recent e deavor 0n the field of hon-
or. We refer, speci Cally, to the Sandbag fight
between the freshmen of those two halls last
Friday evening.

Although the result was somewhat unfortu-
nate, and althouoh tlle event was not a scheduled
part of the agreed-to program ‘for Hell Night,
the contest cannot be condemned on those
grounds alone. Rather the point to be censured
ill this spontaneous exhibition of spirit is that
of inadequate refereeing. One referee alone can
certainly not supervise a melee of spirited preps
in a contest such as this.

Since a display of freshman manpower does
appear to have become a traditional method of
winding up the fall prepping prog- am, perhaps
the answer could be the substitution of the can-
vas pusheball, in itself no dull sport, yet not
quite as frame-jarring, and certainly more eas-
ily refereed,

ling. However, quite a few couples
since then hsve fallen while going

To the Editor of Scarlet and

'nlnck:

I should like to express my up-
preciution to the student body in
general for the spenuld co»opel‘a~
tlon you have given the Student
Union stuff, As a. whole you have
been dignified and courteous.

We do not have everything you
ask for and probably never will
have, but we do hope to be able
to give you HOT CHOCOLATE
and WARM ROLLS when we have
the equipment necessary to do so.

As in any large group of pccplc,
there alwsys are a few who are
careless and thoughtless of others,

l and for those few I want to make
l some suggestions:

1, Do .not throw cigarettes on‘
lthe floor to burn into the wood,
l as well as to give the room a dirty

and unwhulesome atmosphere.

2, Do not linger unnecessarily
long at tables and booths during
the peak hours, especially when
there IS a. crowd waiting in the
doorway. Give them‘a chance to
eat, too.

3. Do not ask to leave IDU's,
but be sure you have the change
before you order.

4. Dn not use the Union dining
room for a study hall during busy
hours, Perhaps the lounge would

are needed to eat on.
On behalf of the staff and my-

l self, I want you to know we enjoy,
Lyn“ Cox serving you, and with your con-l

And while you're celebrating your
