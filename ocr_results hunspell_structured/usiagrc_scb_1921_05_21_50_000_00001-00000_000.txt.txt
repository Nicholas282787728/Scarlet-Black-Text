Golf Majors Teach
Women Vocabulary
Of the Gentlemen

Golf majors have been established
for women this spring, Many of the
men have been majoring in golt all
through their college career, but golf
majors are a new thing for women,
Golf bids fair to be the favorite out-
door sport for the girls if their eager—
ness to hit the ball is anything to
judge by. Two or three girls have
got up nerve enough to you “Fore",
when anyone is as far- away as titty
feet Shouts of, “I hit it that tune,
or Jiggs’ favorable expression of, I
am liable to hit it any time now", are
to be heard on the course now, since
the establishment of golf majors for
women,

The girls are Wondering how a pore
sou can make the ﬁrst hole in two,
when they think it just grand to get
to the green in "only twelve”. Some
of the girls are planning to establish
a prize for the ﬁrst girl to play nine
hole in a single afternoon. It is a
long way around the course, but the
remarkable way that the girls are pro-
grcssing would indicate that the ivory
cuspidor would have to be awarded
soon.

The women need the tutelage of the
men in acquiring the true golfer's lan-
guage. They have some of the neces-
sztly loroelul language, but lack proper
application or it. or course bogies
birries, niblics, and other common ex

ill-c sinus are gaining their place inl

their vocabulary, but the correct con»
nection between the two is lacking.
Bul. give the girls It chance, they’ll
learn!
