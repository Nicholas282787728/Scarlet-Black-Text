Crisis On The Campus

While the situation in Greece is calls
ilg President Truman many sleepless
Tights, and wllile M David Lilienthal is
lot just sure where he stands with Coll-
1g’ress, Grinnell students, many of them ill
s'tuations ot’ someuhat similar though not

identical uneasiness to those of Truman

a-ld Lilienthal, have discarded for a time

their own prl 'ate and personal quandries

ad turned 11 eht and intelligent college

[faces towar‘s the latest campus problem:

‘Shall cors bes be prerequisites for a for»

inlahdanee? Although this question may

seem fairl simple on the surface, requiring
" it docc' he fairly simple answer of
er “Yes” or “No”, its implications and

' llallces of meaning- have claimed the at

'tention and the concentration of some of

' 10 Better Students.

’ ’The nonlen of the college, affected in
'ticular by this Question since the matter
women's invitational dances is the source

.05 the conti elsy, have divided themselves

l' 11:0 two 1‘ ’1c camps. The “No” camp

has a (is e edge in numbers, for it con—

girl who shous hel lack of

and sensitivity by saying, ”It

really doe l’t make any difference to me”
of it 1 embe The“ es” camp, how-
Ilos 1111111101; on its side, and what
lnnelliall may snub Tradition ‘3
There seems to be little hope of all immedi-
‘ce settlement yet perhaps one may be fae

'cvlitated by 0111 presenting here specific
opinions of specific individuals representa»
tive of the student body in general. We
sincerely lope to create, hereb , greater
understanding and to promote a solution
both definite alld agreeable.

.Q. Should corsag'es (presented by the men)
continue to be required at our women’s
invitationais'.’

Lynn Richard Since the fellas have to
pay for them, we should consider what
they want. As far as I know, they are
very much in favor of our not having
flowers.

Maxlne Hay: If a fella likes a girl well
. enough to accept a date with her, he
should like her well enough to want to
buy her a corsag’e.

Pete Hackes: I’m all in favor of no flow—
ers, bllt thel-e’ll always be some joker
who’ll queer the whole thing by show»
ing up with a Corsage.

Jack Dunckel: I think it’s a good idea
not to have them. Nobody's got too
much money this time of year,

Paul James: In my opinion some form of
floral arrangement is required for for-
mal dress, maybe not a $3.00 corsag'e,
but a ﬁlm er of some kind.

Nancy ’1'. Smith: Unless its a really
special occasion nobody appreciates
flowers enough.

11 os and Cons ot tlle isslle. “e lest the

hands), one set of earphones and otllel

necessal3 equipment, must manage to g'ie
30 to 40 parties (glantinn there are [\e‘
phones in each of 15 dorms, plus occasional
office and kitchen calls, the figure doesn't
seem too he'll) satisfaction with a man-
lnunl of I'll outside lilies (the workable
quantity varies) and ten inside wires (also
pretty erratic) within any five-minute per~

(definitely not the operator’s) we ignore
all outside calls, including long- distances,
and incidental: like telegrams and specials,
during these busy periods. That is a rough
sketch ——.y0\l know too well what happens.

What to do about it? Avoid busy hours

the operator to get your call, and answelu
