Stone to leave Grinnell

by left Raymond

This will be the last year at Grinnell ior
Assistant Proiessor oi Political Science
Walter Stone, Stone will be leaving the col-
lege aiter six years here for a position at
the University at Colorado at Boulder. He
made his decision to leave during spring
break when the University oi Colorado,
where he received his master's degree, ex-
tended hiln a “generous offer,"

Stone stressed he was not being tired or
leaving Grinnell discontented with his
tenure here. Rather, the attractiveness oi
the job at Colorado appealed to him
enough to make him leave. stone, original.
ly irom Caliiornia, said that he and his
wiie wanted to go back West, other lactors
include greater time ior research and the
opportunity to work with graduate
students which appealed to him. He inter
viewed for the position in February ”I
have always sort or looked ior a job like
this," he said. “I ieel iortunate to have
been uttered the job,"

Rumors started circulating this iall

about Stone's imminent departure because
his application for tenure was denied. In
fact, Stone was granted tenure by the col-
lege this fall and still had no plans for leave

ing. He must undergo another tenure proe .

cess at Colorado in several years but has
been assured by administrators there that
his position will be “very secure," Stone
insisted that lie was not upset with Grinnell
and exCept {or some displeasure with the
limitations of the small town, “i have ab»
solutely no bad feelings about Grinnell.”

Stone said that the overall quality of the
undergraduates that he will be teaching
will be lower than that at Grinnell and that
he will probably lose some of the satisfac-
tlon of teaching small calsses at the
undergraduate level, He said that he will
miss the quality oi students thathe teaches
at Grinnell but will continue to work his
students hard nonetheless. “Colorado has
a reputation oi being, well, a party
school," said Stone. “I'll just have to do
my part to make it more rigorous.”

College Writing class never
intended for juniors and seniors

by Ellen Heath

This semester was the first time at Grill-
ncll that seniors and secondsseinester
juniors have been excluded from enroll-
ment in College Writing 104

Director oi the Writing Laboratory
Mathilda Liberman said the course was
designed only for freshmen and
sophomores who need a structured com-
position course because they did not do
well enough in their tutorials to suit
themselves or their professors.

She described the course as
“preparatory." It is supposed to teach
students to write for their courses at Grin-
nell According to Libermah. second
semester Juniors and seniors should no
longer need this kind of course. From now
on, the Class will be offered only to
freshmen, sophomores and firstssemester
juniors on a recommendation from their
most recent professor in a designated
writing course,

in the past, seniors and sect) d-semester
juniors have taken the course but it reach~
ed a point where more seniors enrolled
than underclassmen. Liberman said the
stall of the Writing Lab. which teaches the
course, cannot allow upperclassmen into
the course along with the other students
because of limited resources Only two
sections per semester are altered and each
must have only 1310 15 students. ”in order
to allow the instructor to give adequate at~
tentlon to each Student," she said

The Writing Lab staii reserves most oi
its time for Consultations With walkrin
stude‘nts or with those enrolled in Writing
Lab lDD. Juniors and seniors are not exs
cludcd from other writing instruction
courses, Libcrman pointed out. They can
also take papers to the Writing Lab staff to
be read Liberman said students can
receive instruction in writing from other
members of the Grinnell faculty as well;

Cornell College to raise tuition by
$500, cut administrators

by Martin Merlotto

Cornell College, in Mount Vernon, lowa,
is a small liberal arts college, Like Grin-
nell, Cornell is a member or the Associated
Colleges oi the Mid-West (ACM). Both
have a small percentage oi their students
coming from lowa (28 percent tor Cornell
and 15 percent for Grinnell); both stress a
liberal arts education and both are in
financial trouble.

Both Grinnell and Cornell have ielt the
pinch irom the cutback oi iederal aid, and
a declining student population in the
United States. Unlike Grinnell, however,
Cornell's endowment is much smaller
<s2i,ooo,ooo compared to Grinnell's
$35,000,000), which makes it more diiiicult
lor Cornell to absorb any cost increase. It
was rumored that the financial condition
of Cornell had iorced laculty cuts and a
decreased number cl classes.

Such rumors were dispelled by Cornell
oiiicials, who claimed that the college was
more secure than rumors indicated. “Like
any institution, Cornell has problems,"
said Charles M, Cochran, vice president oi
the college. “But we also have the ability
to solve them.”

To reduce the problems, Cornell plans to
raise the tuition of each student by $500 tor
the next academic year. Nine ad-
ministrative positions will be eliminatedin
the next three years and each academic
department must reduce their budget by
five percent. The college also has been
given a boost irom its alumni, which gave

it over one million dollars last academic
year. Cochran also noted that, despite the
smaller endowment, Cornell usually gives
a larger percentage of its endowment to
student ﬁnancial aid than Grinnell and will
continue to do so.

Cochran also denied the rumor that the
college's faculty cuts were an act oi
desperation needed to prevent bankrupt»
Cy. He made it clear that the cutbacks
were a long-term measure taken to meet
the decline in student enrollment expected
in this decade. Tom Church, comptrollerof
Cornell College, said the cutback in the
faculty was needed as “Cornell returns to
historic levels of enrollment after an
unusual period of growth."

To save money Cornell plans a freeze on
all new construction. Church was op-
timistic that the freeze will not stay on for
more than one year.

Such optimism was shared by Jeff Beats
ty, the editor-inschief of the Cornell College
newspaper, The Cornellinn. while Beatty
shares the assessments of Cochran and
Church that Cornell is not in dire financial
straits, he faults the administration for
creating such an atmosphere oi gloom by
the hasty dismissal of some of the Cornell
faculty. “Such actions have led to the im-
pression that Cornell is on its last leg,"
said Beatty. “Such an effect might scare
off potential students who think that Corr
nell is about to collapse,"
