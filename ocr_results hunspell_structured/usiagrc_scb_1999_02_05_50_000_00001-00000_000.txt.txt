Grinnell's Board of'i'rustees Will be
completing their first meeting of1999
today. in addition to their meetings
with the Grinnell College administrate
tors and SGA representatives, two
members of the Grinnell Board of
Trustees, Torn Cech ‘70 and Larry
Pidgeon met yesterday with members
of Gtinnell student body in an effort
to increase communication between
the two parties.

“It's a time for the trustees to keep
in touch with the college community
and to reestablish connection with
faculty and students," said Jonathan
Brand, Special Assistant to the Presiv
dent and Director of College Rela-
tions.

Both Cech and Pidgeon empha-
sized, however, that there is no single
'voice for the Board since each of the
42 individuals has their OWn View of
the college and where it should be
going. .

For example, Cech mentioned that
there are advantages to infrequent stu-
dent communic'ationvwith the Board
and that too much contact with the
students could slow down decision
making and other operations Howv

didn't think that
anything should be

off-limits to the students Despite dist
agreement on that issue; Cech agreed
with Pidgeon's statements that the
main Concern of Grinnell’s trustees 15
to “make college a great experience
for the students."

“The question is ‘how can We do
that best?” said Pidgcon ”Grinnell
spends $18,000 ll year per student out
of the endowment...Carlton spends
58,000. What does the extra $10,000
go for?" '

Pidgeon said that the main role of
the trustees is to act as a sounding
board and overseer to the college life

“We ask questions,” he frequently'

emphasized. “We don't decide on
plans of action," he said. Ccch likened
the role of the trustees to that of a
college professor.

“You may think that if you did the
research and wrote a paper, that it
would be just as good whether it was
graded or not. But you know that's
nut really true. Because you know the
paper is going to be examined by an
expert in the field, you are going to
make sure your arguments are strong
and make sense .. [it] is the same with

us. We vote whether or not We want

Trustees act as somewhat removed
viewers and critics for the best interS'
c. of the college, said Ccch, not. as
Cech and Pidgeon thought some stu~
dents might think, as plorters or ma-
neuvers with their own hidden
agenda for the college,

“When people don’t have commu-
nication, stories get arted and there
is no reality check," said Pidgeon.

Ccch said that they try not to in»
terl’cre, but at the same time they
bring a more objective perspective to
what’s happening and the quality of
student life at the college

“We had to pick a president we had
confidence in, and do our best not'to
interfere with the day to day runnings
orihc college," he said “There already
is 11 president and there already is a
treasurer."

Additionally, Pidgeon clarified, they
are approaching improvements to the
college with the longrange point of
view in mind. For example, regarding

Trustee donates torah to Grinnell

BY SARAH J. LIEBMAN
StaffWriter

Grinnell College purchased a torah,
a parchment scroll With the first five
books of the old testament - Genesis,
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and
Deuteronomy - handwritten in He-
brew.“Torah lives at the heart of the
Jewish community," explains Rabbi
Deborah Brin,“it is important that We
have one."

“As far as I know this is the first
torah the college has owned. It’s re-
ally an important step," said Brin. For
her, the purchase of the scrolls indi-
cates that the “college is very support-
ivc of religious groups...and wants to
make a richJewish life here especially
since there are no Synagogues" in
Grinnell,

Btin plans on performing a sort of
show and tell“so people can see what
a torah is and why it is so special ”She
sees it as “an opportunity to share
[Jewish] religion and culture with
people," When the Aron, a special
cabinet that houses a torah, is built in
Steiner 305, Erin plans to hold the tra-

the issue or buildings on Campus,
trustees have to think about the util-
ity of new buildings in the next 20 or
100 years at Grinncll.

”Our responsibility is to pursue all
that We can do and to dig dccper
(than the surface)" I’idgeon ex-
plained '

Pidgeon recognized that the trust-
ees need more communication with
the students to explore whether or
not the college is providing the best
experience for the Students

“At the end of the day, we‘re got to
try to increase the communication be-
tween our two groups," he said.

Because only a few students were
aware of the meeting in advance, a
mere handful attended the meeting.
t. Pidgeon said he hoped future meet-
ings would be better Scheduled

Acting Director of Students Lisa
Matye. who was in attendance agreed
that better scheduling and better adr
vertising would improve student turn
out and that both groups could anr
efit from a greater degree of interac-
tion.

Since arriving yesterday, the trust-
ees have also met ,with SGA President
and Vice President Pemr Klaetsch and
Jessica Dvorak.

According to Klaetsch and Dvorak,

Should the scribe make a mistake

Garber I
speaks

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
Editor-in-Chief

Harvard's director of the Center for Lit-
erary and Cultural Studies, Marjorie Garbcr
is not afraid to talk about sex, transvestit-
ism, bisexuality or even love.

Although technically a Professor of En
glish, her involvement in a spate of discus-
sions, anthologies and debates on every
thing from “manlinessi’ in American poli-
tics to sexual watermelons demonstrates
her professed interest in the broader world
of cultural analysis.

Thus a Parisian museum's recent ex-
hibit,SeX inArt,dt:scribed by Garber as“a
literaiizing and unerotic look at sexuality,"
inspired yesterday's Convocation,'“The
Gender of Still Life," in Which She at
tempted to reintroduce erotic subtexts to
seemingly benign art.

The body of Garber’sThursday presen-
tation focused on a series of paintings oi
fruits and vegetables arranged by artist
Janet Rickus in couples or larger families.
Reading human characteristics into group--
ings of plant life, Garber questioned the
gender assignations placed on inanimate
objects. _

Looking at a paintingor two squash,
she noted that the larger appeared male',
While the smaller, rounder Vegetable ap-
peared. She then called into question the
basis of this assumption, asking ”How do
We see or read sex and gender?"

Garber then criticized the view at
couples as innlltely heterosexualwhy, she
wondered, could they not he bin or homo-
sexual?

“Are these hetero or homo squash?"she
asked jokingly "With butternut squash, .‘5
particularly hard to "

Garber seemed particularly interested
in challenging culturally ingrained dichoto
mies.Although philosophers have obsc$~
sively attacked binary constructions ofso‘
ciety since the enrly days of
postmodernism in the ‘705, carber pre
sented this deconstruction in the presum-
ably new light of anthropomorphized
fruits and vegetables.

Although much of Garber's Convoc
tion speech did not break new theore
cal ground, her generally easygoing ap-
proach and clever word play(“‘1‘hese pairs
of pears are perverse," she‘stated proudly)
provided a cultural twist to issues that are
rarely addressed beyond the ivyladen town
ers of the intellectual elite.

Applying postmodern and psychoana
lyric theories in a pop-cultural context has
often gained Garbcr the disdain of liter-
ury crillcs.

Ironically, the divisions Gitrber is lame
busted for ignoring are the key to her culA
tural critiques.

With the selliassurcd aspect of a cul-
tuml crusader, she has used Gcraldo as a
iuiupingort point for Foucaultian analysis
of transvestitism.
