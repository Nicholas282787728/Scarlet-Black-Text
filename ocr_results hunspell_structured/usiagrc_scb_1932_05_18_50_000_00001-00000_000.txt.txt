Valley Title

Coach ‘Les’ Duke to Take
Stars to Creighton
Thursday

By MAX ROSS

Grinnell hopes. run high this week
as Pioneer cinder stars make ready
for the annual Missouri Valley out-
door track and field meet at Omaha,
Friday and Saturday. Coach Duke
will leave here Thursday afternoon
with nearly a fullsquad in an effort
to regain the title held by the Pio-
necrs in bygone years.

Grinnell has always finished with
high, honors in Valley circles, and
this year it will have a difficult task
in wresting the gonfalon from Drake,

last year's champions. The Oklahoma ~

Aggie squad will be strong, and may
spring a surprise to come through
with enough ,points to annex the
crown. At least, the Cowboys will
take enough first places to cut down
the Drake total, and if the places
are distributed right, the meet could
easily be swung in any of these three
teams favor.
Outstanding Pioneers

Six members of the team ‘appear
to stand out as the men who will
bear the brunt of the burden for
Grinnell. They are Hank Thomas,
440; Dick Murphy, 330; Fritz Gran
flund, javelin; Harold Alexander,
sprints; Myron Pilbrow, and Joe
Pfeiffer, distances.

Of these six, Pilbrow is about the
only man who is sure of first place.
He has run the two-mile in much
faster time than any of the other
Valley contenders, and ranks with
the leading distance men in the coun»
try. Cosch Duke may use him in the
mile, since Pilbrow should not have
to extend himself to win the two-mile.

Murphy Improves

Each of the other five men has an
excellent chance to win a first if
lu'ck is with him. Captain Thomas
ran the 440 under 50 seconds at the
Carleton meet, and is almost certain
of at least second place. Concaptain
Dick Murphy turned in another great
performance last Friday, and if he
can stave off the challenge of Leon-
ard Gallagher, should the Drake star
run the 880, Murphy will probably
carry off the conference champion-
ship.

With Peyton Glass and Frank
Smith probably not in action at the
circuit mcct, Harold Alexander
should be one of the leading contend.
ers with Bunny Burns of Butler his
chief opponent. The loss of Glass
and Smith will mean a great deal to
the Oklahoma Aggies and Drake,

King Threatens Graflund

Fritz Graflund holds the confer-
ence title in the javeliu throw and
recently placed third in the Drake
relay carnival, but the rapid improve
ment of Don King of Drake offers‘a
threat to his crown. King threw the

Netsters Bid ——-
for Title

Grinnell net representatives will
leave this weekend for Omaha where
the annual Missouri Valley tennis
mcct will be held under the auspices
of Creighton university. The original
plan was to hold a dual meet between
Washington and Grinnell for the title,
but the addition of Creighton to the
fold necessitates a threeway mcct.

Frank Davis, captain and No. 1
man of the Pioneers, will head the
contingentﬁand will probably make
the strongest hid for the singles
title. Fillmore GwynnesVaughan, Don
Rowe, and Bobby Waite will make
the trip with Davis.

Gi-innell's chief competition will
come from Washington, 1931 champ-
ions, and favorites to- repeat, The
addition of Kyran Hines, former Pa-
cific coast star at the University of
Washington, to the ranks of the
Creighton team will greatly aug-
ment their strength, but the ability
of their other members is little
known.

 

Students in Final Dress Rehearsal .,
for Merchant of Venice Production

 

By LILLIE HAGEX

Last minute touches to “The Mars
chant of Venice,” which will be pre
sented by the department of drama
in Alumni Recitation hall auditorium
Thursday and Friday nights and Sat-
urday afternoon, were added at the
final dress rehearsal last evening by
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, director.

This presentation of one of Shake-
speare's most popular comedies will
enable Grinnell students to vizualize
the dramatists as a human being,
whose works are as modern and in—
teresting as any of the plays today
current on the stage or screen. ”The
Merchant of Venice" is familiar to
many of us from our high school
days, where it was read as literature
rather than drama, and perhaps re-
sulted in a misconception of Shake-
speare, the man and the playwright.
This comedy was last given here by
the class of 1856.

Blum Assists

The departments of music and
physical education have collaborated
with the department of drama in the
production of ”The Merchant of Ven-
ice." Elias Blum, professor of theory
of music, has specially adapted to old
lath century airs Lorenzo's serenade
to Jessica in Act II, and the song of
the casket scene, "Tell Me Where is
Fancy Bred," which will be sung by
Robinson Shoulberg. The latter will
be accompanied by the student string
quartet, composed of Ruth Goodenow,
Polly Parker, Ora Lucy Wheeler, and
Georgia Murray, who will play from
music arranged by David E. Peck,
professor of violin, from Mr. Blum's
adaptation.

Venturesome Students Hunt Cyclone
as Chapel Bell Announces Presence

By LUIDA WENDELL

The halfzmoon stored a mellow,
brazen stare at a campus which
giggled and sang in the crisp radi-
ance of last Monday cvemng. Moons
do not discretely summon clouds to
act as dlmmers anymore. It is not
that there arc no more big moments.
but that the moon too, has become a
cynic.

This half-moon looked not for we
mnnce, but technique. There were no
thrills left for him. Why then, did
the moon's ycllow brows elevate, his
shiny jaw drop, and his bright eyes
dilate more than ever? The dates
had left their carefully sought places
of rendezvous to run madly over the
campus, kicking at bushes and peers
ing into bascmcnt windows. Run—
sheepzrnn? Did they think it was go—
ing to rain and seek shelter? Then
the hue and cry soared up to the
moon’s celestial cars. They weren't,
avoiding a storm, thcy were looking
for it. Cyclone'

Moon Looks On

The half moon took a squint
through the window of the little
theatre where, a moment before, he
had seen the dean of women talking
to the college women. It was as here
as the study hall on Saturday night»
The mass meeting joined the pack,
now swelling with recruits from the
quad and the dorms and plunging,
ScrpanlnCrfasllion, in the general dis
rection of a clanging bcll. No moon,
not even a cynical one, could squelch
his iutcrcst in such a rapturous
chase. This moon dodged some stray
clouds and thought how. lucky he wasl
to be high in the heavens where he
could see thc whole Show,

“Here they are!” The many»headed

 

 

mob, ready to follow any mad sug
gestion, dashed toward the chapel,
to find the cry a false alarm. Only
the intentness of the crowd upon the
object of the hunt prevented the
scurrilous false prophets from being
torn to bits by the enraged and,
baffled searchers, The hillfrnloon
shown on the blond hood of Helen
Porzybok, who planted hcrsclf cnlm-
ly in the midst of the bobbing multi-
tude and rcmarked with dignity, "I
believe I'll just stay right in this
place. You can see just about every
thing from here."
Follow the Crowd

Hunters more venturcsome and
sensational shouted, “They ought to
be under the arches of Blalri”, or,
"I'll bet they're in the Music build-
ing"7, and “Two bits they're on
Main's steps." That last wholly or-
roneous remark nevertheless turned
the pack eastward until its inq
itivc eyes fell upon the lighted \Vlrh
dow of a supposedly vacant house on
the corner south of Mcnrs

No one except maybe the half-moon
knows the name of that logician who
first interpreted the phenomenon of
the light in the empty house. The
fact is, though, that Frank Davis
was the first man out of the house
with a yearbook under his arm and a

iumphaut smile on his face, to
greet the hungry mob which pourcd
mLO a fornicrly introvertish dwelling
suddenly turned hospitable, which
marked the end of the trail.

Girls with streaming hair and fel»
lows with beads fuzzy from study,
went in frenzied and came ouL
peaceful, subdued by an irresistahlc
energy more violent than their own,

Porter Speaks
This Morning

Urges Students to Assist

Farmers, Workers

Speaking in Chapel this morning.
Paul Porter, traveling secretary for
the Lcague for Industrial Democracy,
made a plea to college students,
urging them to transcend the inter-
ests of their own class and to align
themselves with tho problems of the
farmers and workers.

“A beautiful America", he said, “is
either a blasted illusion of the past
generation or a possible hope of the
generation to follow us. In America
today is worse misery, than we have
probably known at any timc in our
history."

“The fatty layers of prosperity
have been pulled away, and we now
see our social skeleton in its unpleas-
ant outlincs. Our economic order is
economically inefficient, and grossly
so when we have materials enough
to provide for everyone."

He denounced a social order in
which grain and necessities of life
were rotting away, while millions
wcre starving from lack of them.

“We cannot patch up our present
system; we must build up a new
world of socialism and cooperation
to remove these terrible conditions."
