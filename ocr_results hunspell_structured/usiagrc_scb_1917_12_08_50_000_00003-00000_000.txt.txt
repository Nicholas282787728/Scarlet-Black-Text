GENERAL SALTZMAN WAS
BASEBALL MAN AT GRINNELL

Brigadier General Saltzmnn (ex '94),
ranking head of the United States sig-
nal corps, was at one time a leading
member of the Grinnell baseball team.
Box scores show thzlt while in school
he was a liald hitter and. fast base
runner.

General Saltzman was born and 1-9,
ceived his early education at Panox‘a,
Iowa. At the age 01 20 he entered
Gl‘lllnell, and in the spring of the fol-
lowing YEar he took the examinations
and received the appbllllmellt to West
Point.

He eurly showed an unusual interest
in telegraphy. At the age of 14 the
station inoster had so much conﬁdence
in his ability that he left him in
charge of the Parlor; station on sev-
eral oceastons.

After his graduation from “Vest
Point in 1896, General Saltzmnn saw
active service in Cuba as second lieu-
Lenant in the Firth Cavalry, and later
in the Philippines as ﬁrst lieutenant
in the Ninth Cavalry, Recognizing the
immense possibilities in the then under
velopcd signal corps, he transferred to
that branch of the service in 1901.

For ten years Saltzl'nan specialized
in radio and submarine eohle work.
In recent Years, however, he has been
tremendously interested in Lhe avia-
tion work and has studied t‘leeply into
the possibilities of the wireless in this
branch of the sel'Vlee.
