Keen Competition *And Possible
Broken Records Promised
In Saturday Event.

The 1924 orrtdoor track season will
be ushered in with the anu‘ual hoinc
meet on Ward Field Saturday after-

Vnooll. it good weather prevails, there
will be keen competi on in every
event, and the fans may even look to
see a record or two shattered.

The shot put event will. in all prob-
ability afford the closest competition,
and the meet record, 33 feet, 10 inches,
which has not been equalled in home
meets since 1910, seems likely to he
among the first to fall Saturday.
Three men, Eoge, Boettger, and Meet-
er ,are tossing it close around the for-
ty loot mark in practice, and will no
doubt make a strong fight for the
honor of breaking the record.

The discus is another field event
that will bear watching. Boge set the
record last year wlren he heaved it
133 feet, 4 inche‘s, and if he can re-
peat this year, he should win the
event. However, Rinefort, the prep
track captain, has several tinres
thrown it more tlranr1zo feet, and he
is known to do remarkably well ilndei‘
the strain of close competition.

Dailies Arc Ullcei'tllin

Tho dashes appear to be an uncer—
tain quantity with no nran haying the
edge. Jones, Kitchen, Green, and
Scharnweher of the varsity squad will
probably enter, but the preps have
some fairly fast sprinters in Rinefort
and Hays, The best race of the day
will undoubtedly be the quarter mile.
A host of stars are entered, and some
very fair runners will fail to plac“
Kitchen and Taylor will lock horns'
again, and it is possible that Mcllralh
will also be entered. Besides these
men, stotts. Sciraruwebcr, Gillette,
and Patton are high calibre varsity
men who will niake sure that the win-
ner deserves his medal. The best of
the freshmen in this race is Newton
of winterset, who, it will be Tem‘em-
bered, won his heat of the 440 in the
Grinuell Interscholastic last year, in
the fast time. of 53:2.

If Von Schrader, the prep high
jumping star, can get in shape, it is
not at all unlikely that the record in
that event will also fall, for the
freshman ace has been known to
jurnlp close around six feet in high
school, while the home meet record is
five feet, nine, and has remained in-
tact since 1909.

Taylor will no doubt be the class in
the hurdles, while Meyer, Sebal‘nwehs
er, and Critchett will probably have
things their owoavay in the tworiliile,
iaveliu. and pole vault, respectively.
with such a host of competent ath-
letes, good weather is all that is need-
ed to make the meet Saturday one of
the best in the histo > of the school.

Springtime Arrives
Ahead of Schedule,
In Spite of Snows

in spite of the impolite blotclres or
snow which insisted on wearing out
their welcome before and during vaa
cation, Spring has arrived a little
ahead of her usual schedule, accord-
ing to the record of the earliest
blooming Spring flowers kept by Prof.
l-l, S. Conard.

At present thirteen kinds of flowers
are in bloom on the campus and in
the botanical gardens. The first
snowdrops, hepatica, trilliunr, crocus-

others have appeared from one to two
weeks earlier than usual,

SUNNSIL PASSES NEW
PENN ESYSLUNE

Proposal Features Addition of
Sophomores and System
-of Try-Outs.

Next fall, after sir \veeks' tryouts
held by the twelve juniors to he elects
ed to the Cyclone boztl'll in the nefu
lutul‘e, [our sophomores will l):
selected, bringing the total member»
ship of the board to sixteen. Then,
during the last six weeks before
spring vacation, when the Work of

the annual is completed, tryouts will‘

again be held, and eight sophomores
will be selected, who, with the four
sophomores who will of course hold
over, will make up the board of twelve
which serves during the period be-
tween spring vacation and Commence-
ment. The following September, the
board w 1 again be brought to a
membership of sixteen by the elect»
ion of four sophomores alter a. six
weeks' tryout.

In order to keep a balanced staff of,

workers, provision has been made that
iir case the office of either editor or
business manager should happen to be
a woman, her place in the “rank and
file" can be filled bv the election of
an additional woman. ‘

According to this system, it is hop—
ed lhat each board may be provided
with a nucleus of experienced work—
ers, and the hitherto inevitable, more
or less blind, groping about in a new
field may be avoided.

The new plan proposes that the
senior class be featured, rather than
the junior class, enabling the Cyclone
to give a more complete record of
student activities. Next year's Cy-
clone, however, will he an all-college
annual, or will feature some entirely
new idea.

Successful Advertising Writer
Discusses Value of Liberal Arts

Last fall the Scarlet and Black put
this question to a number of Grinuell
alumni who have bcelr notably success-
ful in professional and business lines:
"Do you believe that a. liberal ans
education, particularly the Grinuell
brand, pays in your profession?" The
alumni were allowed to put their own
interpretation on the word ‘:pays."

The following letter, written from

London, England, by Mr. D. E. Brun-’

dogs, is the ﬁrst answer to be'pub~
lighted. Others will. follow from time
to time.

ML Bruhdage, Mtel‘ graduating from
Grinuell, did graduate woris in meta—
Physics at Harvard. However, he later
decame interested in business and par—
ticularly in advertising, and at the
present time is director of Lord 8:
Thomas, Ltd., an advertising agency
which has offices in» London, New
York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.

“1 am much flattered by your letter
in which you assume that I can give
you a worth—while estimate of the
value of a liberal arts education at
Grinuell.

“You ask \i'lletbel‘ such an educa-

on pays. 1 don’t know what you
mean by 'pays.’ If you refer to the
earning power of the individual so etlus
Billed I shall have to say that, I don't
know.

“I haven’t the slightest ideft whether
the average is greater or less than the
money value of a. professional Dl‘ tech-

nical, training, but if i give your
‘word ‘pztys’ the meaning i believe it
|should have then I can give you a
ldeﬁnite answer.

I "I believe that an education [lays if
lit ﬁres ambition, gives 1!. student. a
constant forward-looking view or
things, the power 0! being at home in
varied environments and the mental
Elasticity, which will make him KEEP
ON WORKING, and be GLAD to keep
on workin’ in Splte of the big or small
failures which everybody is bound to
meet.

“From this standpoint i believe a
liberal arts education is much better
than it LEClinica'l educaﬁon, because it
liberal arts education tends to make
the student view the whole world as
his oyster,~whereas the technical edu—
cation narrows the student's outlook
to include only the world’s mines, or
its health, or its legal difficulties, etc.

“In other words, the liberal arts edu-

Secretary of National Student
Forum Speaks at Chapel
and Macy Club.

George D, Pratt, cxcclrtive secre—
tary of the National Strident Fomm,
in a chapel address this morning,
spoke on the organization and pur-
poses of the Forum and suggested the
formation of a local discussion group.
Mr. pratt, who was here last year with
a group of foreign visiting students,
is traveling this year again in the
interest of the Youth movement and.
following one of the resolved policies
of the national organization, is trying
to stimulate student thought in the
more serious social problems as these
problems affect them and vice versa.

lie began his talk by giving the
history of the Student Forum from
the tim‘e it first was conceived and
organized directly following the war,
and telling obout the policies it has
adoptel and the developments that
have occured since that time. one of
the primary policies has been to aug—
ment in every possible way the ser-
ious interest among students in such
problems as that of peace and war,
what the student owes to society, what
society owes the student, and others
of similar nature. At Harvard, (where
the idea of encouraging sucir thought
first suggested the national prograuri
and which is the headquarters of the
national movement, the work lras
been delegated to bureaus. For exr
ammlc, one of these bureaus will edit
and publish the New student, the
national organ of the Forum. An-
other impurtant bureau arranges rc.
giorral conferences where represent—
atives of several discussion groups of
various colleges rneet autl engage in
creative thought discussion.

Through discussion groups the For.
um hopes to make the greatest stimu—
lrrs on the thought of the younger peo—
plc, and the advent of each discussion
group is another milestone toward
the success of the pr am intended to
eventually settle ti. world’s great
social problems by application of un-
liruitod creative thought.

Mr, Pratt also spoke at a meeting or
the Macy Social Science clrrb which
was held last night.

EIGHT GLEE CLUBS‘
TO ENT R CONTEST

M. V. Schools Plan Contest Like
That Held at Chicago.

Eight ididavestern colleges and uni.
\ 'sities, niost of thorn members of
the Missorrri Valley conference, have
recently tor-med an agreement to hold
a Glee club contest some time this
spring. The rules of the contest are
apparently sirnllar to those of the Chi—
cago contest which was won by the
Grlnnell club some time ago. Each
club is limited to thirty undergradu-
ate members, and each club will sing
a prize song, a college song, and a
song of their own selection.

The project has been under (onsla-
cratiorr for some tim‘e. Grinuell was
asked to enter the contest, but in view
of the fact that the Grinuell club had
an opportunity to enter the larger
aud important Chicago contest, it was
thought best not to accept.
