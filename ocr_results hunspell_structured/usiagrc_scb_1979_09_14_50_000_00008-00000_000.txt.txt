prestigious recording label
with which the Trio has recent-
ly signed a long»term contract.
An internationally renowned
periorming trio with a small
liberal arts college as a base is
not inappropriate. To have that
college tucked within the corn»
fields of rural Iowa is an
equally suitable setting (or a

is a very famous position,”
said Goldsmith, “Only 12
schools in the U.S. actually
pay performers.”

With a scholarly love tor
chamber music, the Trio is in-
terested in audience develop-
ment. “We are developing any
diences [or the future," said
Goldsmith. They view the pre-
sent as an “era oi
rediscovery” for classical
music, and want to contribute

to the revival. To bring their
music to the students, they
have augmented the tra l-
tional schedule of Herrick con-
certs with performances in
South Lounge, Roberts
Theater, and casual ap-
pearances in various dorm
lounges

Teaching courses in the
music department, rather than
detracting from the
Mirecourt's time as per-
formers, has given them con-
tact with the students and the
chance to expand their au-
diences. Goldsmith, Jensen,
and King represent almost half
of the Grinnell music faculty.

Their performances are not
limited to the Grinnell campus.
As leading participant in the
Local Artists in the Schools
Program, the Trio had played
for the local high school and
ior primary schools. They in»
itiated a program of chamber
music concerts at the Des
Moines Art Center in 1977-78
and have perlormed in various
small communities around
Iowa.

Summers for the Trio are
usually spent on tour. They
toured Europe during the sum-
mer 0t '76 and were followed
by excellent reviews. Next
summer, the group will be the
resident ensemble at the Green
Lake, Wisconsin. Festival of
Music. Under the terms of the

This year, the Mirecourt will
play tour concerts tor Grinnell
businesses (to be selected) as
part of a move by the com
munity to establish an arts
council, Said Goldsmith, “We
have a strong iollowing in the
community of Grinnell. .We
are the most public aspect of
the college.”
