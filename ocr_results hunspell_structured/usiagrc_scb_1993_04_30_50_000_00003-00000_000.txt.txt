Letters to
the Editor 3'3:

To the Editor:

I have just finished reading the
articles which appeared in the April
23 5&3. I was somewhat stunned by
the contention made by the faculty
that students were hanassed and presA
sured into not signing up for Ian»
guage houses.

I would submit [0 you that not
only is this contention false, it is
thcexact oppositeofthe truth. lam
a sophomore majoring in a foriegn
language, Since late February, I
was contacted incessantly by slur
dentsrepresentingalanguagehouse
who were wondering if I was inter-
ested in living there. I told the
people in question that I would
consider it.

Then, shortly before spring
break, I was contacted again and
asked for a final decision. I in-
formed them that I had decided
against living in the house. I figL

 

 

 

ured that this would be the end ofit.

Unfortunately, I was mistaken.

On the Wednesday after break, I
was approached by a professor and
told that there were fomis I had to sign
regarding my housing. I was some-
whrtt confused and asked what this
was about. EVidently, my name had
been Submitted in spite of my earlier
statement that I was not interested.

I told this to the professor who
told the housecoordinatorof my ”back-
ing out” of tlte agreement. The house
coordinator proceeded to beg me to
reconsidersaying thatthegroupdidn’t
have time to find another resident.

I was ﬂabbcrgasted. I had told
them three weeks earlier that I was
not interested. Certainly this was
enough time to find a “replacement.”

Nevertheless, I expressed my
sympathy for the group’s plight and
gently butlinnlyrepeated my denial.
The group proceeded to find another

resident evidently, but shortly there-
after I was again approached, this
time to be asked in would sign as an
alternate. This thing simply would
not die.

At this point. I became some-
what hostile. “I have told you before
that I am not interested.“ I said. “Fur-
thermore, I have told you 01311 have
already signed up for a group draw
and am ineligible as an altcmate. I‘m
sorry. Go away."

“I was somewhat stunned

sured into not signing up

Since late February, I was
contacted incessantly by
students representing a
language house who were

ested in living there."

This broughtan end to the inces-
sant queries, but since. I have been
treated as a traitor by both the stu-
dents and faculty members alike and
made to feel as if I have done some-
thing wrong. This is crazy.

I don't necessarily object to lan
guage houses receiving priority over
omer applications, but I think it ts
completely and totally unjust to allow
them to enjoy special privileges. Fur»
ther, I find the complaints of hamss»
ment to be unfounded and asinine.
This is, as Doug Cutchins pointed out,
simply anattempt to make the college
look good. I am appalled.

Dear President Ferguson:

It has been mentioned to me by several people who
were present at Monday’s protest over the language
decision that my name came up. I was told that you
complimented me discussing solutions to the language
house dilemma. I was also informed that you could not
remember any specific suggestions that I offered. I have
decided to write you, Oda Callison and Tom Crady, and
send acarboncopy to theS&B, sothatyou and tltecampus
community can judge my suggestions.

Obviously the present situation is unacceptable, and
something different needs to happen next year. Whatever
the decision may be, the final choice should be one that
has been raked over the coals, so to speak. I think that my
ideas are fair, and will please the most people.

The driving reason behind my suggestions is that the
students should be running campus. I feel very strongly
that the students should be the ones who decide what
campus life is like. I believe that my proposal is one that
lets the students achieve this. Remember that my sugges-
tion is just a rough skeleton, and will most likely need
modification and additions:

I. Establish language floors as opposed to lan-
guage houses.

The advantages of doing this are as follow:

People whochoose to live on a language floor would
be doing so for the reason of enhancing their language
speaking ability, or to live in a language environmenL not
so that they could live in a house. I believe that many
people live in language houses for the sole reason that it
is a guaranteed way to live in a house.

Also, the number of people wishing to live in a
language environment would no longer be a set number.
The number could very easily be fleXible.

I would also suggestthatall ofthe language floors be
in the same hall. There are quite a few people who would
benefit from being able to go from one language environ-
ment to another easily. Many students are not just bilinr
gual, but multilingual. We have a no-smoking hall, we
could just as easily have a language hall. ..

One reason I hear for [having] language houses is
that itgives the students aplace to havccultural functions,
host receptions for students going abroad to foreign
language—speaking cultures. and as a place for SEPC
meetings. These are all good reasons, butcould be met in
a language hall. It would also be more efficient in a
language hall; insteadof hosting two or three geHogclhers
for students going abroad, there would be twoor three per
language. Plus, students going to bilingual countries
would be better informed of [gatherings] for both of the

languages they may be preparing to speak.

II. Establish Three or Four houses as “Language
Priority” housest

If the administration and/or the language faculty
deem it necessary to have language houses, then at the
VERY least, the houses should bestudentrinitiated. This
could be done in a very simple manner. Three or four
houses could be designatedas“languagepriority“houses.
If a student wanted to live in a house, and live in a
language environment, then a student could go through
the housing process and create a project house. The
student would go through the same process that other
students who want to live in houses do. The only differ-
ence would be that language houses would be given a
priority in several houses.

I would have to say that even this is not very
satisfactory. I would not like to see any preference
placed on language houses at all. 1 think that if the
“language priority" houses were instituted. the system
wouldbeabused.Perhapsagroupofpeoplewho wantto
getahouse would have two or three people in their group
who speak another language. They could then get a
house easier than another group for the solepurpose mat
they are bilingual. The motives would notbe the motives
that ﬁt the purpose of the language priority houses.

I do not see why languages should be given such a
priority for houses. I understand the beneﬁt ofliving in
a foreign language environment, and I think that this
could be met better in a language hall, Why not have a
biology house? Or a history house?

I say that there should be no preference atall for any
discipline when deciding the housing arrangements, Let
the students run campus life. We have done a fine job in
the past, and will continue to do what is best for Grinnell
College. That is what has made Grinnell a great school,
and that is what will continue to enhance the quality of
life here at Grinnell.

From the Editor:

Matt Haber requested that I include a note stating
that he received a response from President Ferguson
lettinghim lcnow thatshe appreciated thathc had senther
his suggestions in concrete form.

Haber feels that Ferguson received his ideas‘well,
thoughtfully and respectfully. He does not wish to cast
unwarranted criticism on the President, only to allow the
campus to read his suggestions and remind President
Ferguson how important this issue is to students.

 

 

To the Editor:

An organization called, quite
oddly, Concerned Women ofAmerica
is running a toll-free hotline for the
purposeofenlisting opposition to the
lifting of the military's antirgay ban.
This is a proﬁt-making enterprise
which uses hatred and fear of gays as
capital.

Thehot—line numberis(800) 225-
8683. Call it and express your oppo-
sition to their operation. Itcosls you
nothing and it wastes money that
they could be spending more effecr
Lively on other aspects of their effort.

Every time they pick up the
phone, itcosts them money.If enough
people engage in this effort against
them and call enough times, it could
eventually cease to be cost-effective
for them torun the hot-line, and with
out the hot»line their money-makin g
ability is crippled. Without money,
their organization will die.

When one calls, they thank the

caller for calling in support of“mili—
tary values“ and then ask for the
caller's zip code. They then ask for a
nameand explain that they will. for a
fee, append the caller’s name to a
message to your congresspeople op-
posing gays in the service. When you
call, give them fake names and zip
codes if you want.

Talk real slow and stall them on
the phone with any delaying tactics
that you can think of. Waste their
time. Request more info. Use their
money, and do it again and again.

After the operators have ex-
plained what they will do for you.
they will request your address. Don’t
give it to them. Tell them what you
think of their position, or just hang
up. And then call back.

From each person who is actu-
ally willing to spend money to have
an organization write or telegraph to
Congress for them, Concerned
Women of America takes in about

$8.00. Everyone who participates in
the effort to make them regret having
a toll-free number should try tocall at
least enough times to increase the
organization‘s phone bill by$8.00 so
as to offset the money intake from at
least one of their supporters. One
might have to call two or three dozen
Lima or more to do this, but it only
takes a few minutes, and sheer num-
bers of calls alone can win this one.
There are a lot more gay people

and people who support equal legal
status for gays than there are people
who would actually give money toan
entity like Concerned Women. Ev-
erything homophobes and anti-femi-
nists like Concerned Women do from
hereon is a swan song, and it’sabout
time they be shown that they won’t
be allowed to roll back justice by
peddling huge profit-margin hatred.
