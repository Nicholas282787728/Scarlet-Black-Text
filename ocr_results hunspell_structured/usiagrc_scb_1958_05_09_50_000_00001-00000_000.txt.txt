A crowd ot over 200 people
attended the Wednesday meetv
ing of the Student Council to
protest a decision ot tho Spring
Day commit/tee not to hold
Spring Day yesterday, as had
originally been planned.

The Council in opening the
meeting decided to table all
regular business tor a discus-
sion oi Spring Day. Paul Jones,
committee chairman, said that
rain was torecast and that at
that time buildings and
grounds manpower on duty
could not handle the job or
setting up the audio and phy—
sical lacilities necessary.

Bob Weitzman intormed the
council that campus Saga Food
service director Bob Fisher
was willing to make iood are
rangements for Thursday. He
also assured the council of vol-
unteer manpower irom the group
which attended the meeting for
setting up equipment.

Bob Curvey, who voted “no"
on every motion of the eve»
ning, argued that the decision
of the date tor Spring Day
rested with the Spring nay
committee, appointed by the
student Co u n c ll Executive
committee.

A motion was then made, and
passed on a recount vote, that
this power be taken away from
the committee. The motion also
specified that Spring Day would

council.

The ﬁnal motion of the eve-
ning, speciiying that Spring Day
be Thursday, passed.

. . .

Some oi those attending the
meeting ieit that the council
was not properly reﬂecting
the will of the students. As
expressed by Dick Hewitt,
“You turn your backs on stu-
dent wishes." l-lcwitt went on
to remind the council that it
had “never seen beiore and
will never scc again" the ca
pacity crowd which attended
the Wednesday meeting.

He directed his remarks par-
ticularly to the council mem—
bers who voted against rever-
sing the Committee’s decision.

The concensus was that both
professors and studcnts, with
apparent exceptions, had expecta
ed Spring Day Thursday. it was
argued that some professors and
students were not properly pre-
pared for Thursday classes.
