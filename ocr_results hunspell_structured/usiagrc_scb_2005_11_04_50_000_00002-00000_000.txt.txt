WMD and terrorism
discussed in week-
long symposium

The search for weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) may have ended in lino, but rhcy were still
on the agenda this past week in a Rosenfreld sym-
posrum.

This week's symposurm addresses terrorism and
weapons ofmass destruction. Speakers this week both
criticized and defended United stares policy,

The symposium featured speakers from a variety
of backgrounds and polrtrcnl vrews. Presenrers and
panelists included the director of the Carnegie Ens
dowmcnt for International Peace. a former Chief of
Staffto the President's Critical Infrastructure Protec-
tion board and a former Spectrtl Assistant to President
George w. Bush.

The lecnu-cs ranged from the nuclear programs of
Iran and North Korea to the failures ofU.S. nonplo-
liferation polrey.

Symposium topics and speakers are selected by
a l4-mcmber committee made up of seven faculty
members and seven students. A stated goal ofthe pro-
gram is to achieve a diversity of opinions and topics,

Molly Lewis ’06, a student on the committee, felt
conﬁdent that this symposium would spark interest
across campus. “Terrorism and weapons of mass de-
struction seem to be a constant source of discussion in
today’s world," she said. “This topic remains relevant
[even] though we set this symposium last year."

Though the symposium concluded with a lcc-
ture delivered by Elizabeth Turpen, she was nor the
originally scheduled convocation speaker. Aecordrng
to Lewis, the “original convocation speaker was called
away to Europe for a conference on nearly rhe same
topic and was unable to be here."

The Rosenfield Program in Public Affairs, In-
ternational Relations, and Human Rights aims to
broaden the knowledge and participation of students
in three core areas: public affairs, international rela-
tions and human rights.

& ASK THE PRES

Where do you like to hang out?

I am not sure I can totally get into the spirit of this question, but
iris no secret that I like to be home at night with my family and
my dogs. 1 also like to go running in the early morning and the late
afternoonThe rest of the time I am at the office, and I admit I like
that. When] am on vacation, I like to be at my home in Rockport,
Massachusettes doing chores. lfI am travelling I like to be in Lonr
don or New York or Washington. Near GrinnellI like to take a walk
in the Krum preserve.
