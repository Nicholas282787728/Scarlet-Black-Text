Alex Woods '03 and 3le Bryce '03 had not planned [0

day morning. They were supposed to be setting up for the
Rnging Cow Atlatl Meet. Instead, they were sruek outside
in near-freezing {empEmrurcs directing participants to the
house ofiohn Whittaker, Anthropology.

AsWoozt and Bryc: directed, Wl'nluker was at home,
realizing that the wearherwns not going to allow the event
to be held on the track as planned nnd frantically trying to
ﬁndsomeplsee dry to hold the meet. He tried area nrehery
ranges, but had no lurk. Flnally, he tried Byron worley,
who owns a woodworking shop in the basernent or
Grinnell's spalding Building, Worley agreed to let the meet
oke plaee on the nhnndoned upper floor afthe building.
and the Raging Cow was book on.

“We swept off the dust and the dirt end the dead pi.
gcons and made K work,"Wl1innkcr said othc last-minute
site ehange. “It was a little bit cramped and it was den.
nitely unusual.”

Despite the odd lomtlongpaxllcipanu shared drespner

including Whittaker and 12 Grinndl studcnn, turned out
for the seeondonnual Raging Cow rneer.

For the handful of specimens who also made the trek
to the spalding Building, the event was perhaps just as
unusual as th: sirc. Atlatl tournamenm at: a cross bciwcen

Whitraker is responsible for bringing both dre ancient
“ovelhnnd bowling" and the Raging Cow to crrnnell, As
:ln archacologlsr who has studied uneient ntlarl users,
Whittaker ﬁrst beennre interested in rising atinris for two
rensons- for fun nnd fur academic experiments with them,
Hesaid he quickly snw the value in spreading hrs hobby to
his students.

“It seenred to me that it would be really tun to get
students involved with it n a wry orienrning a primitive
technology that’s not too dimeult to learn quickly, but is
hard enough to get good or that it really inspires you to
admire the skill nnd knowledge rhntgoes into n lot ofpre.
historic technologies,” Whittaker said.

Four yrnrs ogo, Whittaker took a group of Grinnell
students on i fall visit to the Cnhokin Mounds archame
logical site in Illinois for an adati oornperition, and the
sctiviry quickly caught on. Whrrrnker and the students or-
ganized an informal ariad learn.

“it; about the most intonnnl riub sport at Grinnell."
said woodo, who starteddrrowing rwo yai's ago, “You oorne
our to the target behind John’s house when the wenrher is
nice and throw with a buddy or two."

“I like the earnsrnderie [ofthe team] most," snidTnvis
onnsby '03, who joined the team two years ago after tak—
ing a elass from Whittaker. “Them are quite a or number
ofvcry interesting people who participate in arlutling, and
getting a Ghana: to talk with then. is deﬁnitely one of the
bonuses."

Wlntraker said the tenrn has developed to incorporate
a wide variety of people. “There's a surprising number or
people who are inrerested in other kinds oraneienr emits
and things, and others who are interested in enrly weap—
onryand things oithat sort," hesnid,

Despite its popularity, the team quickly found that there
were no spring atlatl events that were within easy traveling
dismncc. The ream thus deeided to orgsnire its own, and
the Raging Cow was born The tournament’s name, :lc-
eording m Whitraker, came from a l-Slllrr he designedwrth

Anatomy of an atlatl

ihe atlatl is an ancient weapon that was
used by culture: around the world for both
hunting and ﬁghting. it is used rn conjlmb
tinn with a light spear or dart,- the atlatl
hook is inserted into a notth in the end uf
the spear shaft and the spearrs hurled with
an overhead motion. ihe atlatl ads like an
extensron aftlietlirowel’s arm and gives him
or her the alrilrty to launch a spear much
iurlher than ordinarily puxsible. Anerent
atlatls were made irom a variety of materi-
als, like wood and bone.

From the tshirt the inert has grown rnro nn dnnual
event that attracts portieipsnts both from the college snd
horn the nren. This yesr's tournament rentnred n number
oteonresrs nnd, for the ﬁrst time ever, a formal intercollce
glare eornperition as Luther college brought 14 throwers
to Crrnnell.

“Grinncll, I'm happy to say, won that event_nnrrowiy;'
Whittaker said. “So we get to keep the trophy we ererted,
a little plastic cow.”

Partieipnnts said that the unusurl venue mode for on
unusual round otevenn this your.

“Th: pcrspeerive in [the building] was really weird and
made the targets seern ren rinrea farther away then they
really were,”Wood5 said, "The eonerere wall: were no treat
either when you missed. we broke or least 16 or 17 dms
in that silly factory. Nree days, sunshine and a lack ofdead
pigeons would probably have improved my aim."

orrnsby agreed that the conditions hindered eornpeti.
rion, but said he slill enjoyed the event. “Nobody threw
very well [Saturday], nnd Sunday when we threw outside
in the freezing cold, was even worse. we had a lot of fun
though. even lfnobody threw very well. "

The run is what will keep the Raging Cow (ournztv
