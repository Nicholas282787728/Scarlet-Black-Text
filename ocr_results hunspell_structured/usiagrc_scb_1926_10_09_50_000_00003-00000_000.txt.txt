THERE’S no other sport on the calendar to
compare with smoking a jimmy-pipe packed
with P. A. Indoors and out. Any season. You
win even when you draw, if you get what we
mean. And how you will draw, once you know
the wonderful taste of Prince Albert!

Cool as an over-cut notice from the clean.
Sweet as the thoughts of a holiday. Fragrant as
woodland ﬂowers after a spring shower. P. A.
never bites your tongue or patches your throat.
The Prince Albert process ﬁxed that the day
P. A. matriculated. »

Come out for this major sport. Get yourself
a tidy red tin at that nearby smoke-shop where
they hand out P. A. sunshine. You and Prince
Albert are going to be great buddies right from

the start. Because there just never was another
tobacco like Prince Albert!
