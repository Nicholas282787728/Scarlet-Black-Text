MASEFIELD DDMES TD ‘
AMERIDA DIRECTLY
FRDM BATTLEFIELDS

Has Been Designated as One of
the Official Historians
of the War

NOW PREPARING A WORK
ON BATTLE OF THE SOMME

Took ‘Active Part in the Military
Operations at Gallipoli and
Other Fronts

John .llaseficld, the English poet,
will be in Gr-innell next Saturday ever
ning under the auspices of the Gl'inr
hell college lecture course.

He arrived in America lust recently
after spending some months on the
battleﬁelds of France. The boches
shot at him arid missed—many times—
but between shots the poet took ocul—
sion to observe a lot of things, to help
where he could and to gather material
which, as one of the regularly desig-
nated "official historians of the war,"
he will put into a three-volume work
he is now preparing on the battleof
the Somme.

Wits Formerly a Sailor

ilr. llaseﬁeld is one of the men who
has done the most to humanize and
rationalize the popular conception of a
poet. He does not wear long hair, and
does not prrfume his haiidkerchiefs.
He has been a sailor and a farmer. and
the hriefeat biographical sketch can—
not omit the fact that he once tended
bar in a New York saloon!

Mr. Masefield devotes himself to the
interpretation tbru verse of his own
personal outlook on life. His poems
deal both with the experiences of his
thrietl career, and the phases of life
which have been revealed to him froiu
the rim of experience. He is sell-edue
eated, and has no master.

Rise Wits Spocmculur

This poet was slow to receive recogr
nition, but after the c‘tics changed
their minds aborlt him his rise was
spectacular, and he shares with Alfred
Noyes a remarkable following thruout
the Englishrreadilig world.

His popularity as a speaker and
reader has been attested many times
. n this-country, and his activity, lliillr
tar-y and literary. at Gallipoll and uthr
or war fronts has brought him promo
nently into the public eye.

day evening on the “Attitude of the
French Under stress of War."

He described the tremendous pln i-

ninpli of perseverance and teiiaci
Our man have stood this ter ’ble strain

“The morale of the French prisoners

“Vl'olllen of France have been sorely
tried," he continued. "They have lost
a million and a half men. Erci other
woman in the street is in black. They
are nni-scs and,housckecpers, are on
orphan and refugee committees; pros
vide clothing for the needy, and moral
conilort to the wounded. The courage
of the women has been splendid in err
coin-aging the men.

To endure the physical and moral
stress of the war is possible only if
supported by strong moral tor-cc, is ex-
plained only by the noble idealism am—

tic declared that the French had ale
ways been idealistic, and that they
tried to carry into practical politics
their ideals of liberty, equality and
good fellowship. He explained that
France had enlarged the ideal of the
world, giving it an absolute scone.
“This ideal is religious," he said. “(or
it lecognize that there is something
above llioney~lnaking, mere iridustriah

For the second time this season the
Ci-iimcll basketball team will go into
action on a strange door whcn it plays
the Cornell team at ilt. Vm'llon on
Friday and follows this with a return
engagement at Cedar Rapids Saturday
night with the Coe ﬁve. with a chance
for a high rank among state schools

a determined stand in these two Cone
tests.

The scarlet toenr emerged from the

That they will lie pitted against one
of the strongest learns in the state is
true, but judging from the outcome of
the fast to ‘7" l‘eslilllall scrimmngcs,
,Grinnell speed and teamwork will
prote a worthy opponent for Cornell's
decided advantage iii height and
weight. Cornell has an enviable rec-
ord this year and the early season de—
test which they handed the lowa ag-
gi-egation must be taken seriously on
account of the overwhelming score.

Coulparatlve SCOi'CS indicate Llial the

vantage when the two learns meet, but
tilde locals hare been improving rapid-

Due to the inexperience of the m

The speedy center will be given a
chance to prove his ability whcn he
takes the ring oppo 'LC Tom Kepler,
the rangy pilot man for thc Cornell
team. Last year "Mike" completely
outclassed his opponent and with an
even break in luck should have no
