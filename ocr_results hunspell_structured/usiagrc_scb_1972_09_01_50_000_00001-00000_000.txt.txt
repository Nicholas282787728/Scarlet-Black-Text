College In 'Identity Crisis’

by Don Dagenais

Physics professor Beryl Clotfel»
ter, for the past two years Chair»
man of the Faculty at the college,
has issued to faculty and adminis-
trators his report for the academic
year of 197l-72. Following a review
of the academic events of the year,
Clotfelter concludes that ”certain of
the assumptions aboutacollege edu-
cation and the procedures for obtain»
ing it which have been held with
little challenge at Grinnell for many
years are now being questioned, and
the effect is to produce an identity
crisis for the college." Since the
"condition of change will continue
for at least some time,” Clotfelter
recommends that the college re-
assess some of the “assumptions”
under which it has held its phil—
osophy in the past, with the in»
tention of “establishing our sense
of our own identity and our place
in the educational system.”

The report begins with a look at
the level of faculty salaries Ad-
ministrators have previouslypoint—
ed out, Clottelter noted, that ”we
have fallen behind many other
schools with whom we like to com-
pare ourselves and. . .we are no
longer in as comfortable a com-
petitive position as formerly."
President Leggett has already pres
posed that the money allotted'to
faculty salary increases be sub»
stantially increased this year.

Time of Change

The academic Changes which took
place here last year were substan-
tial: the grading system was changed
to a credit-erase system, a Re-
ligious Studies Department was es~
tablished, majors were created in
Religious Studies and Black Studies

(although ”there is no expectation
that a Black Studies Department
will follow”), a certification pro»
gram in elementary education was
reinstated, the description of inde»
pendent work was revised, the pro»
cess of "systematizing" student
input into policy decisions was be»
gun, and a policy of conducting or»
ganized searches for black and

women faculty members was be»
gun.

The last, according to Clotfelter,
was ”the most important from the
long-range View." The effect or
the effort itself, he Said, “will
be permanent,” although the ma-
chinery of the Search Committee
itself is “cumbersome.”

The report contained a stirring
defense or the policy of searching
for women and blackstaffmembers.

"When the college Seeks anAmer»
ican historian, it discriminates
against European historians;ahd
when it looks for an organic chem~
ist, it discriminates against in»
organic chemists. The faculty al-
ways discriminates in choosing new
members, and now we have been
reminded lhatbalancebetween sexes
and among races should be consid»
ered along with balance among dis-
ciplines and fields within diSr
ciplines.

"Even if We had only white male
students," Clotfelter continued, “it
would be important to demonstrate
to them that neither sex nor any
single race is uniquely gifted with
those abilities we seek in faculty
members. To refuse to offer such
demonstration would he to encour»
age unfair and degrading stereo-
types "

From ‘Gurdner - Cowles Foundation

College Gets $l Million Grunt

by Merry Wiesner
President Leggett announced, at a
faculty meeting Wednesday, the
grant ol 1 million dollars from
the Gardner»Cowles Foundation to
the College, to be given out in
$200,000 installments for the next
five years. This money, along with
other miscellaneous grants, will be
put to what Mr. Leggett terms
"Phase ll" of the Academic Im-
provement Master (AIM) plan, seek-
ing to “tie lihancial askings to ed-
ucational objectives”, This stands
in sharp contrast to Phase 1, which
has been going on the last five
years or so, which sought to im-
prove the colleges physical setting,
under which numerous repairs and
renovation, including the Physical
Education Complex, were funded.
David Krudeneler, president of the
Gnrdnel‘»deles Foundation, noted
that the foundation’s trustees made
the grant “in recognition of
crinnell's superior quality and with
the hope that it will insure Grin—
nell’s being able to continue in the
future at the same high levels."
Dean Walker, explaining the gen»
eral financial situation of the col-
lege, pointed out that although the
total gift flow to the college is
on the increase, more of this is
going to endowments, rather than to
plant and operating budgets, although
the budget will see an increase this
year of between 4% to 5%. He noted
the allocation ofthe Gardner»Cowles
gin-$100,000 a year will go for
faculty salaries, which will mean a
7% average increase, $80,000 for
other academic expenses, including
faculty research and study pro-
grams, the library budget and

Sorry About That

You think you have problems?
imagine the editors of the $51.5
last night when they discovered
that three-rourths of the copy
for this week's issue had been
lost in the mail during the day!

Now that's a headache. But
they sat down and after a few
trustrnling hours ot effort
managed to reconstruct the key
articles and conle out with the
flimsy four pages you hold in
hand.

Our apologies to reporters who
worked hard on their articles.
All should appear next week.

And by the way: We dedicate
this issue to the glorious Work-
ers of the United State Postal
Service. They may not be ef-
ficlent, but they sure make life

 

interesting,

 

 

Kugisaki ls Coordinator

by an 5le son vrucr

Craig Kugisaki will be the Student
Coordinator for the 1972473 aca-
demic year, the Student Govern-
ment Association announced Mon—
day, Kugisaki, a senior irom Hilo,
Hawaii, served for the first semes-
ter of last year as an assistant
to the Coordinator before he left
campus for the Costa Rican Sem-
ester during the second term.

He has had much previous student
government experience in High
School, where he was president of
his student government and held
other positions as well. Last year,
“after two years of political dur»
mancy,” he got involved in SGA
and applied for the Coordinator
position when Terry Wolf resigned
as Coordinator, as reported in the
Ser last week.

The Coordinator’s office, Kugisaki
told the 5&8, “is pretty much an
information-flow center, making
sure that things which are supposed
to get done really do get done"

. i
The

l a
Coordinator has also nctetl as
an ombudsman for the students, to
receive and deal with student com»
plaints and questions.

"Our goal is to try to open up
the channels for students to parti-
cipate by allowing accessbility or
information in academic areas, so-
cial policy, and campus issues,’
he said. SGA will this year be
looking at the judicialcouncil sys-
tem, the advising systems of RA’S
and SA'S, and EPC structure in the
academic arena “John Pfeffer and
Anne Walter, the SGA Vice-Presi»
dents, provide the structure. We

make sure that the committees are
filled and that they function,” Kugi-
saki said.

The two Vice»Presidents and SGA
President Russ McGl‘egor will be
"the leadership for change. Our
office will then try to put it to-
getller.”

“The community here is small,
and it is ii flexible place. The Ol—
fice ol the Coordinator facilitates
the input of students into contro-
verSlAl areas The Coordinator‘s
office always works. But as to what
it works 11!. it depends on the
issues." lfi a crisis situation the
office is more active than usual,
making sure that ”a forum is
created for students.” When there
are no pressing issues, the office
“makes sure that the Structures
that have been established function
smoothly."

Kugisaki invites all students to
come to the office “to Sit down
and rap We'd like to talk to stu-
dents, and we’ll take complaints
big and small "

academic equipment, and the re-
maining $20,000 for student financial
aide in order to facilitate the in-
crease in the student body proposed
and accepted last spring.

Along with increases in faculty sal—
ary, Leggett sees a thorough ex-
ploration of all factors affecting
academic life at Grinnell as vital
to AIM goals.

"The time has come", as he put
it, ”to sort through the mass of
educational notions that have sur-
rounded us," In order to do this,
Leggett broke down his central
question of determining what sort
of educational experience is most
beneficial, both to the student as
an individual and the community at
large, into eight major areas
of study. These will be handled by
study teams from the Deans of»

NUMBER 2

ilces, with interested student and
lacnlty participation.

The eight questions involve the use
of independents and off-campus
study, the relation of living situa-
tions to a student’s academic ca»
reer, the origins of Grinnell’s stu-
dents, both social and geographic,
the criteria for evaluation, the va»
lidlty of the lour»year residency
rule, the importance of maintaining
a balance between the three academ-
ic divisions, and the expansion of a
career counseling service for grad-
uating seniors,

It is hoped that these investigations
Willari‘ive at someconclusionslatet
in the year, in order to begin in—
tensive all-campus discussion ofed—
ucaliunal objectives and to facilitate
the best use of Phase II AlM funds.

Form College Pub ?

by John Wylie

John Pfeffer and other members of
the Grinnell SGA have been working
throughout the summer. planning the
establishment of a student run pub
on campus,

Pfeffer told an SGA meeting Mon»
day evening that he hoped a firm,
detailed proposal could be presented
to the Trustees ior their approval
during their Fall meeting on Novem-
ber 4th and 5th.

Work done so far in planning the
pub will be submitted to the Social
Policies and Regulations Committee
at their first meeting. Pfeffer said
that he would reccommend to S P
h R that a referendum or opinion
poll be devised to measure student
interest in the proposed new ven-
ture. If the results show strong stu»
dent interest, the Committee will
then be asked to consider Whether
the pub should be run by students
with a professional manager, or by
a protessional agency.

Pfeffer ravors theformer arrange-
ment, with student employees run-
ning the pub under the supervison of
a manager with professional exper-
ience in the field. Under the current
proposal, the pub won“ be set up
as a separate, non-profit corpora-
tion, with any profits after paying
the overhead and entertainment be-
ing returned to the General Budget
and Reserve Fund for reuse by stu-
dent organizations. He pictures the
pub as an informal gathering place
for students, perhaps with some folk
music and “a coffee—house type at»
mosphere."

Several temporary locations forthe
pub have been proposed, hutthe most
feasible appears to be the Private
Dining Rooms in Gardner Lounge.
Pfeffer explained that the room has
a separate outside entrance, and is
located directly under the Quad so
that noise from the pub would not

disturb students.

Pfeffer told the 5&5 that the Cards
ner facility would be completely re»
decorated and modernized. Air con-
dltioning, swinging doors at the en-
trances and exits, and complete

indirect lighting all are being con-
templated for the new lacillty.

JiB. Grinnell Intervene:

There are many problems to be
resolved, however, before a final
resolution may be presented to the
Trustees for approval and the pub
established. The major one involves
the land reversion clause in the
deeds to college lands which came
from J.B. Grinnell.

Grinnell deeded a great deal of
land to the College with the pro-
vision that the land would revert to
him or his heirs if the College al~
lowed alcoholic beverages to be
served on the land.

College lawyers examining the doc»
uments say that the land reversion
clause probably has no legal force
today, but they are checking thither
into the matter before givingthe pnb
a green light.

Another legal problem is that of
the Iowa majority age. Liquor con»
trol laws state that no one under
legal age (19) may enter a tavern.
Pfeffer hopes that a way may be
found to allow those on the cam-
pus under the age oi 19 to enter
the pub and enjoy the entertainment
even though they will be unable to
consume liquor.

Pfeffer also noted that a decision
must be made whether a pub should
have a Class B Liquor License (Beer
only) or a full Class A Liquor
License. The latter is more costly,
but allows for the serving olall types
at alcoholic beverages, including
Wines.
