Waiting to Exhale

Waiting to Exhale was a sure
prise hit this past holiday season.
Essentially a story of female bonde
ing, Waitingrogxhalefeaturessome
of the top black actresses of the day,
including Angela Bassett and Whit—
ney Houston. While Waiting [0
Exhale isn't above falling into the
trap of measurin its characters
against the men t ey do or don’t
have, it still provides a strong, (e
male—driven story. Emphasizing
character development over a zippy
plot, Waiting to Exhale takes the
growin body of “women's” movies
and ski lfully adds race to the equa
tron.

Beyond Rangoon

Beyond Rangoon is a beautifub

oieultures, Director John Boorman
playswiththe almostarchetypalsto-

endsup irrevocablychanged. Patri.
cia Arquette is the outsider. in a
nice change of pace from her stan—
dard,sweet«natured vamp roles. She
plays an American doctor who be—
comes caught up in the political and
social upheaval of southeast Asia.
Though Boorman tends to be overly
ponderous, Beyond Rangoon is still

a deeply invowing iiiin. (Cerspow

Town movie review

JENNY BAUM
KATE LYONS

The Birdcage was one of the
best moVies that we've had to review
all year. On a very superficial level,
it has the same plot as Romeo and
Juliet, that oiyoung lovers with war—
ring families. The twist is that the
warring families consist of Robin
Williams and his gay lover as the
owners of a drag nightclub on the
groom's side, Gene Hackman and
his lune Cleaver-esque wife and rig<
idly conservative antirgay political
campaign on the bride‘s side.

But the plot of the movie isn‘t
important to its appeal. Watching
this mot/ie, we weren’t impressed by
emotionaloutpourings, norpolitical
propaganda.Robin\Vllllams'hunky,

ly similar to To Wong Foo, Thanks
IorEverything, and Julie Newrnarin
its portrayal of homosexuality and

family values, the movie treats the
issue with more sensitivity and less
