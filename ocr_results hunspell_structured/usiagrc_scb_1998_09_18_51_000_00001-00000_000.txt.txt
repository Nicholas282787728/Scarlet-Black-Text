initiatives’ policy for future

A contribution toward the purchase
of computer soﬁware for Davis Ele
ementary Schoolthis weekrepresented
part of a four-pronged “community
initiatives" policy instituted by Grin-
nell College to demonstrate the
college‘s commitment to the Well-be-
ing ofthe city and its environs.

There‘s been a lot of discussion in
Gri'nncll recently about a new Fund for
Excellence at the college and how it
might affect the community. Some of
the discussion has centered on such
things as the possible relocation ofthe
college’s book store to a downtown
location and the possible construction
of a new inn close to campus that
would accommodate alumni and other
guests oflhe college.

The college‘s new president, Rus-
sell Osgood, has issued a statement
describing, the policy on community
initiatives, andhe saysthatit“doesnot
reﬂect any new allocation of resources
to such initiatives but is the basis for
ongoing and new commitments."

Earlier commitments

In an interview with The Herald—
Register, Osgood stressed that the
policy isn’t really new.

Hispredecessors,PamFergusonand
Charles Duke, were “very committed"
to the idea of working to improve the
community, he said. And it has been
topic of discussion between Osgood

and the college’s board oftrustees.

“I myself thought, and the trustees
clearly thought, that this is something
we should spend more time on, and
somethingweneedtomakecleartothe
community," he said.

Inhiswrirtenstatcmentonlheinitia-
tive, Osgood wrote:

“Grinnell College is a noteforsproflt

staff and students recognize that attain~

college's corc mission is tied to the
well-being ofthe community in which
the college is sited. To that end, the
college is mostclosely interested in the
following:

Grinncll‘s Ag Appreciation Day
Thursday topped itself in more ways
than one.

Not only was the attendance up but
the number of tractors for the classic
farm equipment display and the con-
clutling parade offarm machinery exe
cccdctl last year's event by almost 30
machines. A total of86 tractors made
it to the event compared to 58 last
years, according to Jim Urfer, one of
ihosc who gave so much time io plane
ning the evcnt.

In fact, the earliest vehicles in the
parade were back even before the final
ones got offlhc block.

A news story last week revealed the

by changing favored old recipes using
the techniques of these two newer
pieces of equipment. That might be a

Each recipe lists Just what simple

ting board, paper towel, bowl, table-

what to do with them.

What's more, this is not bogus food:

cation community in Iowa and through-
out the United States."

Osgood added that the college in-
tends “to report to the community from
time to time on the speciﬁc activities
that it has undertaken which reflect
these commitments,”

Frank Thomas, the college‘s ad-
ministrative coordinator for com~
munity relations, is the principal li-
aison with the community, and 05-
good said he hopes members of the
community will give the college some
feedback by contacting Thomas.

“We‘dliketo hearbackfrompeople
from time to time about this," Osgood
told The Herald-Register. “Obviously
we‘re not going to do everything We
eryone in the community wants, but
we want people to know that we're
interested."

Planning ﬁrm hired

Asked about the reference to the
city’s downtown area, Osgood said
the college has retained a planning
ﬁrm to develop “campus master plan"
thatwillfocusnotonlyonthecollege‘s
property but on the area surrounding
the institution.

“We’re obviously interested in the
downtown area ofGrinnell and also in
areas near the college," he said in the

interview. “The master plan will look
at that set ofissues."

Thetrusteesandadministration have
engaged the planning finn Shepley
Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott
(SBRA) ofBoston, in association with
Dober, Lidsky, Craig and Associates
(DLCA) of Belmont, Mass, to de-
velop the plan.

Frank Thomas explained the pur-
pose ofthe project.

”The firms will conduct a needs as-
sessment oftbe campus and will meet
with faculty, staff, students, adminis-
trators and alumni on campus to estabe
lish academic, administrative and stu-
dentelife planning and programmatic
parameters," Thomas said.

Choosing the best alternative

The ﬁrms will analyze the condition
of existing buildings, the campus and
its environs; formulate and review al-
ternatives; and synthesize the best of
the alternatives for future building
projects and needed facilities.

In his interview with the newspaper,
Osgood said that the college has some
space needs that may require moving
some things off campus. However, he
said, no decision has yet been made to
move the book store downtown or to
build an inn.

“It is a fact that a number ofcolleges
and universities have moved their book
stores off campus," he said. “But we
have a faculty committee that will give
us advice regarding our book store.

“Also, we have no plans to build an
inn on any particular site, although I
will say that I would like to have an inn
close to the campus. It would be good
for our alumni and convenient for
guests ofthe college, as well as fora lot
of speakers who come to town. But our
board of trustees would have to make a
commitment. At this point, there is no
decision or even a preliminary plan."

Completed in a year

The college hopes to have the needs
assessment and final masterplan com-
pleted within a year.

“With the plan, we will have a long»
term vision for the campus and its
surroundings," Osgood said in a pre
pared statement.

SBRA has a diverse practice, Os-
good noted. The ﬁrm won the Ameri-
can Institute of Architects AIA Firm
Award in 1973 and has been honored
with other major design awards since
then.

DLCA is recognized for providing
assistance in campus and facility plan-
ning, as well as facility programming.

“DLCA has planned all aspects of
college and university campuses and
has previously provided professional
services to Grinnell," Osgood said.

Dollars for Scholars:
a good local initiative

It was gratifying to report Monday that a local chapter ofthe Citizens
Scholarship Foundation of America, popularly known as Dollars for
Scholars, is now up and running in the Grinnell-Newburg School
District. Given the success ofa similar program in the neighboring
Brooklyn-Guemsey-Malcom School District, some might suggest that a
Dollars for Scholars effort should have been undertaken here a long time
ago. But the important thing is that the program is now organized 7 and
that the ﬁrst scholarships will be awarded at the end of the current school

yean

The success of Brooklyn‘s effort has been the result ofa strong
commitment by many sectors ofthe community — BGM alumni,
businesses, industries and private citizens, As we reported in our

Monday edition, the BGM
awarded scholarships totaling
$43,875 at the end ofthe
1997-98 school year, a
spectacular total, given the
size ofthe school district. At
that time. the chapter had
amassed an endowment of

$634,641, evidence ofthc strong support the program has engendered.

So the BGM effort is a good model for Grinnell-Ncwburg. Dan Keller,
one ofthc organizers ofthe G-N chapter, told us that the initial focus
will be on alumni ofthe school district. However, there also will be a
campaign to enlist the support oflocal ﬁnancial institutions and busi-
ncsscs. No, the chapter won't have a huge endowment immediately;
building up the bank account will take time. But it‘s an attainable goal,
given the local commitment to quality education.

Why set up a Dollars for Scholars program? The ﬁrst and most
obvious answer is that the cost of higher education continues to soar. But
another reason is that some students don’t necessarily have access to
other scholarship programs. And those who want to pursue their studies
beyond high school, Whether in academic or technical ﬁelds, can use
some help, even ifit’s not a huge amount,

The Dollars for Scholars program is lime-tested and effective, and it
deserves broad support. We hope local contributions are generous ones.
