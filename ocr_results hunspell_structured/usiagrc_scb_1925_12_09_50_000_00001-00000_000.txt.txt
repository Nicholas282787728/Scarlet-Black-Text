Count Byron Khuu de Prorok who
will appear as the next number on
the lecture course on January 21, has
just conrpleted an expedition into Af—
rica. He discovered many ancient rele
ics which he will probably bring with
him on his American speaking tour.

count de Proi'ok will lecture on the
subject "Recent Excavations of Car»
thage and the Dead Cities of the Sa-
hara." The Count is a Fellow of the
Royal Geographical Society. an offi-
cer of the Nichem Iftigar (Tunis) and
a Norton Memorial Lecturer of the
Archeological Institute ol America.
He has recently returned from an ex,
pedition to the site of ancient Car-
thage and in northern Africa,

Illustrates 1 ill Pictures

The lecture will deal with his dis—
Coverles around Carthage and will be
illustrated with still and motion pic—
tures made amid scenes ofgrcathis—
tor—ical interest, A unique feature of
the lecture will be an exhibition of
rare objects, some nearly 3,000 years
old, discovered in the ruins of Car-
thage. A large collection of these
amazing relics, including jewelry,
toilet articles, coins, tear cups and
pottery will be exhibited.

.Count de Prui'uk deals with a (as
ci'nating subject.’ the story of his ex»
pedition into the depths of the Sahara
Desert. Here were discovered the rc-
mains of long forgotten cities, built
during the period when the Roman
Empire was supreme in North Africa.
Every incident of his eventful journey

,across the desert will be shown in
-Count de Prorok’s pictures, an im-
pressive feature of which will be
closeup views ot once magniﬁcent
temples and palaces standing in ruins
amid the desert sands.
Tells of Thrilling Exploit

In the course of his lecture, Count
do mrorok will give a thrilling account
of the exploits of the Kahena or Sa-
hara Joan of Arc. a young and bean—
tiful woman, who led the desert tribes
in a war against the Saracens toward
the close or the seventh century. Af—
ter routing the enemy in many bat-
ties, she was ultimately compelled to
retreat. when she took refuge. with the
remnant of her forces in the great RC-
rnan ampitheatre of El Djem. where
she withstood a siege of nearly three
years. She fell in battle while head-
ing a charge against the besiegers. The
scenes of these stirring events will be
shown in the motion pictures.

A recent issue of the New York
Times contains a report of one or the
latest discoveries of Count do Pm-
rok's expedition. A parchment manur
script has hen located which may be
of such value as to result in full e -
planation of the hitherto mysterious
history of the Tuaregs. It is the our
ly written record known to exist which
can reveal information regarding this
puzzling white race so closely related
to the tribes of northern Africa. The
expedition also unearthed a tomb,
presumably that cf Tim Hinan. the
legendary ancestress of the Tuaregs.
Further investigation revealed that
complete excavation of that massive
iy constructed monument would re-
quire four months and demand exten-
sive organization. count dc Prorolt
expects to return next year with the
necessary equipment.

Count de Prorok’. by reason of his
marvelous and intensely interesting
discoveries brings to his subject a
fascination which is greatly enhanced
by the tangible results of his work
which acompany him.

Semester fees admit to the lecture.

$8,000 PAID TO UNCLE SAM IN
ONE YEAR BY COLLEGE STUDENTS

 

"The Grinucll college ftnd its stu
dent body annually contribute, via
the post—oifrce. more than t .000 to
Uncle Sam’s treasury." said Mr. Ar-
thur Burton, Grinnell post—master, m
an interview Saturday morning.

“More than twenty per cent of all
the mail handled by the postrofiice is
to ftnd from students, This consists
oi letter, small parcels, and laundry
bags. The latter makes the largest
single work 0[ the post—office depart—
llient,” a -. Burton continued.

College mall varies very little from
day to day. Approximately the same
number of letters and parcels are
sent and received by students every
day. This is the exact opposite of
the city mail, the amount of which
fluctuates a great deal.

There is no doubt in the minds of
the post—office department as to when
school starts. Immediately after the
return of the students, the mail ‘in.
creases more than a fifth in amount.
This ssze influx halts as suddenly as
it begins when the school year is
over. The letters and small pack-
ages for the college students, after
reaching the postmffice, are given
what is known as a primary distribu-
tion, It is then given to the car-
riers. who redistribute it according

to buildings, cottages, and college ole
(ices.

Tile women’s mail is delivered to the
quadrangle by a regular car er, and
there it is redistributed by a student
to the individual roms. The student
who distributes the men's mail calls
for it at the post office. so that he
can place it in the hands of the stu-
dents earlier in the day. Large pack—
agcs and laundry packs are delivered
by truck to the cottages and buildings,

Grinnell’s postroitice which is the
finest in the state for a town of this
s c, affords every modern conven—
ience for the rapid and neurate ha‘ndr
ling of mail. Mr Burton finds it nec-
essary to curtail his substitute help
during the summer months. but his
regular employees work the entire
year. regardless of whether or not
the college is in operation.

“The post-office iorce greatly ap-
preciates the detailed address which
the students put upon their letters."
said Mr. Burton. “We also wish to
thank the student body for its coop—
eration with the postroffice when
changes regarding address and paste
iage have occurred. It is always a
pleasure for us to serve our college
visitors."

Sumo Kllkllimil Visitors.

Robbers Visited'the vault of the
college bookstore and the library be—
tween last Saturday night and Sunday
after-non, nraking away with ass in
money and pens from the bookstore
and several dollars in cash from the
library.

It was not known how the building
was entered but on Sunday afternoon
when Manager Manly Jones went to
the store he found the door to the rear
room off its hinges, the back entrance
door unlocked and tracks leading oil
the back stairway.

Nothing was missing from the main
room but it was later found that the
vault had been entered and it was
there that the thieves made their haul.
it is thought that the library wits
first visited and that from there the
keys for the vault room were obtained.
How the safe combination was solved
is not known although it is probable
that the combination was obtained
from a slip in the bookstore desk.

The door to the administration
building showed the effects of a jim—
my Monday morning but admittance
was not gained, It was probably the
intent to rob the college vault also.

As yet’ no clues have been discov—
ered. A large track in the snow over
the front entrance window and the
same track on the back stairway are
the only traces of the guilty party
that have yet been made public.

Bars have been placed on the Cole
lege bookstore doors and other pre—
cautions arc being taken in an at-
tempt to make the place secure in the
future.

It will be remembered that the
bookstore was robbed two years ago
of a large stock of pens. That rob-
bery took plece during the noon hour
and only the front room was visited.

Manuscripts Received

Tire editors of the Tanager, Grin-

Team Prospecis Growl

Prospects for a good team next year
are bright since only five men of the
thirteen letter winners this year will
be lost by graduation. They are Cap-
tain Sweet. Howartb, Moran, Mayer
and Wing.

Letter winners this year who will
be eligible next fall are James Cori,
Wendell Davis, Porter Martin. Arden
McClain. Richard Seeland and West
Stotts. Ted Peterson, an i-ionor G
man of two years ago will also have
another year of competition.

Couches mum and Black willhave
a strong line with veterans at every
position, McClain and Nibio will be
seen at the ends, Davis and Martin at
tackles. Seeland and Carl at guards
and Peterson at center, Weitz,
Parks. Ruse and Spencer who were
on the varsity sound this year will ai-
so make bids for positions on the 1926
line.
Have backfield Nucleus

Although the backfield will not
see many old men in positions there
will be a good nucleus in Meeber and
stotts around which to build the at-
tack. Meeter was an all-valley half—
back this year. showing great class
in running and kicking and he will
no doubt be the Pioneer's “dangerous
mau" next fall. West Stotts will be a
quarter of two seasons experience
when he takes the field next year. He
is a dependable player, and can run
back punts as well as any man in the
valley.

other men who will make strong
bids for places are Evabn and Hayes.
both of whom saw considerable ser-
vice this year hut not quite enough to
win a letter. Wolfe and Lamb are
men with football ability. Lamb
starred at Carnegie Tech two years
ago and if he gets going next fall
he should make a great ground gain-
er. Kingery. McLaln and a number
of good men from Coach Duke's year-
ling squad will make up the rest of
the available backfield material.
