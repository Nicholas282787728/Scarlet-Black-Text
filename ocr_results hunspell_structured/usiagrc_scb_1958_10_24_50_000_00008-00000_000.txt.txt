on, among- otllel' things, education and European attitudes toward America.

Aitcr iive days at sailing,
the Walls arrived in London
tor u week oi orientation
provided by the Fulbright
committee to acquaint them
with British lite.

Having completed orientation,

Carnegie research in the has
tioiial library oi Scotland, which
corresponds closely to our Li»
brary ot Congress. He also did
intensive research in the small
town at Duntermlins where Car
ncgie was born. He spent some
timc in four Scotch universities
which have lecture systems
similar to our own

The Scotch People

Wall was greatly impressed
by the hospitality oi the Scots
and at the case with which he
could ﬁt into their society, "The
people were exceedingly gens
erous and helpful." For the ins
dividu'dl, Wall said that being
an American was not a disad—
vantage, although ho Could tic-
tect a latent feeling ot antr
Americanism. The Scots had a

college preparatory course,
which is in the liberal arts
tradition, the student, accordv
ing to Wall, has almost the
equivalent oi our liberal arts
college education.

At age 18, he may go on
to the university where he imr
mcdiately launches into his
tield oi specialization and
studies virtually nothing else. in
the college years, Wall obs

which they had obtained from
our muvies and literature.

They also admitted fear of our
foreign policy. being dubious of
thé way in which it was Con—
ducted and extremely Critical of
Dulles.

Viewing Scotland as a na—
tion, Wall said, “1 was not
prepared tor the intense na-
tionalistic feeling in Scotland,
nor tor the stress placed on
being a separate people irom
the English. The Scotch peo~
pic have their own culture
which they desire to keep
alive, not wanting to become
Anglicized. There is intense

. London,"

The Walls found time to obs
serve the people and the rustic
beauty oi Scotland. One mem—
orable sight in Edinburgh was
an old castle situated on a high
ridge. “Scotland is one oi the
most beautiful countries in
Europe,” said Wall. “The high»
lands are still wild, desolate and
lonely." .

Educatiibn

He noted that while the
Scots' system at higher educate
tioii very much parallels our
own, the English system is quite
dittcrcnt. Discussing higher ed»
ucation, Wail iobservcd that
“There is no qucstion that the
British student is carried along
faster in primary and elemenr
my school.”

He goes on’ to emphasize the
tart that the English student,
starting school at five and tin-
ishing a 18, cmcrges irom sec—
onday school with 14 years at
education, compared to our l2

general knowledge, the British
student delves into his Specs

the Amcrican specializes, the
Englishman moves on to general
study. ,

It is interesting to notc that
the undergraduate British spe»
cializaion is broader than tha
of the American postgraduate.
While the American may spe-
cialize in one patieular era oi
our history, the Englishman
finds it hard to believe that
there is enough there to study.

Wall remembers an incident
at a dinner at Oxiord. Seated
next to an English scholar, he
was,asked what iicld he was
in. Replying "American his-
tory," he was answered wi h,
"How extraordinary. There's
so little oi it.”

Wall noted somc cnvy among
the British of the tact that
American scholars are producing
more exhaustive works dealing
with Bri sh culture than are
the English themselves.

to do some additional travel—
