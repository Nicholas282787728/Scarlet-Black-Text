since 1964. Grinnell College has covertly
employed unregistered Asian women to
compile its weekly memo. For the past
iiyc years, these women have been
primarily Laotian reiugees Supplemented
by an occasional Samoan, Ling has worked
at Grinnell since she arrived in the United
States with her [our children in December
of 1982. She is not listed on the campus
payroll, she cannot be found in the campus
directory, she does not even receive a copy
of the campus mem Grinnell College
does not recognize Lin existence

work, each woman is paid $3 as. an
average oi $.17 per hour

The memo is produced in a series oi
cubicles just like Ling's which are located
beneath the South Campus loggia, The
glasseblock sections of the loggia floor are
the only light source in the production
area. Due to 2i lack of maintenance and
ventilation, the women‘s cubicles are
humid and insectrinl'ested

The women are allowed only a tells
minute lunch break each day during wli’ ‘h
they may not leave the production area.

is eight pages long (is typed pages), the
Laotian women must type 24,000 pages oi
text each week (336,000 pages each
semester), Aside irom typing the memos,
the workers must handcoilate and staple
each issue. In addition, the women are
responsible for handrdyeing each in-
di 'dual sheet oi paper in an inexpensive
semi-toxic solution. This process is re
quired by the college because a ream of
white paper is thirty cents cheaper than a
ream oi colored paper. For one day's
