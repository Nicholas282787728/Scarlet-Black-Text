”Res'earth‘ﬁ‘lietnaiive Media

Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St.
Louis, Seattle, and San Fran-
cisco. Part of the under-
ground? Maybe. Terry Clif’
ford, ’73, and Tom Thomas,
'70, were all these places and
more this summer studying
alternative media projects
around the country. They
visited over 50 underground
newspapers as well as radio
stations, magazines, and
newsletters.

"We both feel that all under?
grounds shouldn’t be placedin
a single attegory," saidTerry
in an interview with the 8&8.

Two Traditions

”Undergrounds seem tohave
ties to two essentially distinct
traditions which strongly in~
fluence their purpose, style,
and organization,"addedTom,
who was on campus thisweek.

There is a long history of
explicitly politiml journals,
ranging from the pame
phleteers at the time of the
American Revolution to the
Marxist papers of the 30's,
which mainly focused on mean
retlml development, analysis,
and some muckraking. On the
other hand, Tom and Terry
explained, there are “avante-
gmrde, alternative culture"
papers that trace their origins
to the early hippie movement
on the Coasts, and still ear-
lier, to the "beat" movement
of the 50's. These papers are
readily identifiable by their
bright colored inks, intricate
artwork, and “consciousness
type" articles.

"Most papers have synthe-
sized these two traditions,
particularly since the merging
of the cultural left and the
political left in the late 60’s,"
said Terry. She added that
papers generally still mains
min strong orientations to-
ward one direction or the
other. “depending upon the
backgrounds and beliefs ofthe
individual staff members."

Different Goals

Tam pointed out that some
papers still function almost
entirely within the earlier tra-
ditions. " ‘Palante',the Young
Lords' paper, the 'BlackPan-
ther’, and the Berkeley ‘Tribe'
are papers that see theme
selves as propaganda organs
of organizations with an ex
plicit ideology. 'Mother Earth
News', 'Rolling Stone',and the
'Whole Earth (htalogue', on
the other hand, are concerned
almost exclusively with cul*
ture and life style," he said.

"As you (an see," saidTer-
ry, "evaluations of papers
must mrefully take account of
the different goals the papers
are trying to reach. There's
no one standard for all."

Stagnation

A major shortcoming under-
ground newspapers suffer
from is stagnation. Terry
explained, “Although papers

were successful in shaping
the 'synthesis format’, we felt
there was little development
within that format itself."
Tom continued, saying,
"They’re not aware of the
greater political sophistlr
mtion and consciousness
which they, as well as anyone
else, helped to create. Also,
the papers haven’t analyzed
how those changes and experi-
ences have altered the con-
text in which they are work
ing."
Insensitivs

Finally, Tom and Terry feel
that underground papers are
not sensitive enough to either
new areas that people are now
focusing on or to long standing
questions, such as the educa-
tational system, realisticorr
ganlzational alternatives, or
health care.

They suggested that the
newspapers "take a goodhard
look at themselves and ana»
lyze the generalpoliticalsitu-
atlon in America and the dy-
namics of the "movement"
for the past ten years. Tom
elaborated, ”This includes
what mistakes have been

made, what people have
learned, and what are the
logical new directions to take.
Also, the staff must analyze
the community in which they
function and what their roleas
radical journalists should
be."
Community Ties

”Papers need to redefine
and strengthen ties with the
community in which they ex-
ist," Tom continued. “They
should use their technical
skills to create a format peor
ple can use to communicate
with each other and use their
analytical skills to put for
ward new ideas through which
people can better organize
and control their lives."

Draw Own Conclusions

"The best situation,” Terry
concluded, ”would be to have
articles written with con-
fidence in peoples' ability to
assimilate new facts into their
changing political conscious
ness and actions; articles that
present new ideas and infor
mation in a forceful and di—
rect manner that enables peoV
pie to draw conclusions for
themselves."

ACTION Recruiters To Vi 'I

Grinnell students interested
in entering the Peace Corps or
Vista in 1972 should begin the
application process now
according to Todd R. Wilkins,
Area Manager of ACTION, the
Federal agency which over-
sees the two programs.

Immediate Action

He urged all seniors
who will graduate in May to
contact the recruiters, since
the application process is
quite lengthy and many train-
ing programs take place in
June and July.

January graduates must take
even swifter action. Wilkins
urged any interested second
semester seniors interested
in the program to take two
actions immediately. First,
they should procure the ap‘
plication forms for the pro-
gram in which they are in-
terested from the College
Placement Office and begin
working on them.

Questions

Second, they should get in
touch with the Des Moines
ACTION ofﬁce with any ques-
tions they may have about the
program. The address is
Room 741, 210 Walnut Street,
Des Moines, Iowa 50309.
If it is more convenient to
call, the ACTION office will
be glad to accept the charges,
the number is (515) 284—4087.

prime source for volunteers,
he stated.

Recruiters

In a telephone interview with
the 5&8, Wilkins stated that
Miss Kathleen Crow and Mr.
“Noosh” Nishihara, recruit
ers formthe Peace Corps and
VISTA would be visiting the
Grinnell campus on October
19 and 20 to meet with in-
terested students. During
their visit, they can be cone

Squarcd off and ready to go, these barefoored Sunday folk
dancing enthusiasts anticipate another round of fun.

Folk Dancers Slay Busy

Department and a folk dancer
for over twenty-five years,
Mrs. Roecker has been des-
cribed by one group member
as "Just a great person, one
of the finestpeople on campus,
and very dedicated to the folk
dancers." Although the
group's repertoire is enorr
mous, Mrs. Roccker still
makes an annual trip to a folk
dance camp in Stockton, Calir
fornia to learn new dances to
teach to the group; occasionr
ally she even brings some back
from Europe.

Miles Sato, 3 second-year
member of the folk dancers,
describes her as an "incred‘
ible teacher. She teaches new
dances quickly by brcaking
even the most difficult ones
down into easily learnable
components such that the steps
at least, get ingrained in the
head if not in the feet.”

Another dancer recommend-
ed, ”Those whopossessa nat»
ural propensity toward corpu»
lence are advised to join folk
dancing, as they will be able
to dance and prance lithely
and lissomely to class.”

One of the most active and
increasingly popular groups
on campus, the Grinnell folk
dancers, is beginning its sev~
enth year with an agenda full
of new activities added to the
group's regularannual events.

The group plans a special
Parent's Day Program for
October 16 at 9:30 13.111. in
Darby Gym. Afolk-dancing de-
monstration will beperformed
by club members with open
dancing afterwards in which
everyone is invited topartici-
pate.

Also this year, members of
the folkrdancers have been
teaching dances to children at
Uncle Sam’s Club. Sometime
in October, a dance demon-
stration is tentatively planned
at an Iowa girls’ high school.

On September 17, some club
members travelled to Des
Moines to tape a fourrminute
time-slot of folk dances for
the “Mary Brubaker Show"
on KRNTVTV which was shown
at 9:00 a.m. September 22.
The sponsor and teacher of
the group is Mrs. Pirkko Roe-
cker. A member of the P.E.
