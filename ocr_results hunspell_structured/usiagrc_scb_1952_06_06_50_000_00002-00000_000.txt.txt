Farewell. . .

A l’arewell editorial is a d cult one to write. It is
so easy to become trite and overly sentimental.

2 Last week we said goodbye to our regular l'eadersi
Gilnnell students 19.)? brand. And because they were ollr
contemporaries, we tried to remain a little brusque. a little
bl:

Eut now we‘re writing for you, the parents alid alums
who‘ve experienced the little pang that we feel now. We
can probably afford to be just a little sentimental and you
will be able to understand ollr sentiment. For we are not
only leaving Gl'ilinell, we are leaving college, and with
that, a part of our youth.

All week we've watched them go. The cais with the
varircolored licelise plates would draw up, take Oil their
loads of lamps, bulging scrapbooks, and heavy boxes, and
depart, taking with them, ollr friends.

In two days, otller cars will draw up for us. take on
their loads of lamps, bulging scrapbooks, and hem ' boxes,

and depart taking with them, ils, the class of 1 2, and
our memories. .

When we return to Grinnell, we will return as alumni.
It won’t be the same.

Gentlemen, We Salute You!

They’ve occasionally refought the Civil war and they’ve
sometimes had internal strife, but north and south Youn‘
liei- halls have come through their first year on campus
with an amazing record.

Last fall, the two new men’s halls were officially
opened with a multitude of preps and upperclass fellows
from every hall on campus. Though they had a varied
group of men, presidents Jim Mol iii South and Doug
Freyder iii North helped form them into two well-func-
tioning units. ‘

The achievements of the two halls have been outstand-
ing. In intramurals, South took the track meet and North
tool: the golf. The trophy for first place in the Fetzer
Sing also went to South. North can boast top men iii all
phases of student life: the C of P president, the social
coordinator, and the presidents of the freshman and sopho-
more classes.

. Both halls had it tough at the beginning of the year,
but both of them have come through to take their place
alongside the more established north campus institutions. .

There was also a new personlin an administrative
capacity who did an outstanding job this year, He is Nors
man Marble, head of housekeepingr 'and maintenance Mr.
Marble came to Grinnell just this semester, but the ideas
and improvements he brought with him have already
established him as a definite asset to the college.

‘ ior.

From the President . . .

Parents, alumni and friends who visit the campus at
commencement time will, 1 hope. see evidence on every hand
that they are welcome here. For many months we have
been planning for these days of reunion and fulfillment.

For returning alumni there will be the joy of res
membei'ing, the satisfaction that even though physically
different, the college ill sprit remains the Same For par-
ents there will he the pleasure of seeing children pass

'another milestone iii personal achievement. We know that

no oile will get a clear image of the collegeas it is today
from the activities of a commencement period.

There are, however, some aspects of ollr institutional
life that can be obse cl and evaluated. Most obvious, of
course, are the physical improvements. The science building
and the new dormitories are tangible evidence of creative
planning on the part of the administration and great sac-
rifice on the part of many people.

Our faculty will be available for friendly
serious conferences This fine group of young men alid
women represent one of the great assets of this college.
To those who miss the old faiililiar faces of those who are
no longer here, it will he heaitening to catch the spirit of
these new facultv members and know that there is all
essential greatness inherent ill this faculty which angers
well for the future.

Members of the administration will be glad to talk
with you with complete frankness as to the problems which
we face both institutionally and economically the plans we
have for the fliture, and the hopeful cou ye with which
we face each day's new tasks. Perhaps the most important
things about the college no one will be able to see at all,
At best they will be reflected in the attitudes and the spirit
of the students who are graduating from the college and
those who are here to render some service during the
commencement weekend.

The senior class is made up of a group of voung people
who_ have demonstrated tlleir right to our respect and,
admiration Tlley have met the rigorous demand of our

lacademic program. They have been good citizens of the|
Grinliell community and through their giving‘of tliemselves‘

to the college have left something precious of themselves
here for oncoming generations of students to profit from
Talk to tllese young people Behind their mature and poised
adjustment, their bright hopefulness about the future and

their enthusiasm for the life which they have lived here,l

you will be able to sense those non-physical aspects of the
life of this institution which are of greatest importance.

Colleges like Grilinell have an ongoing life not only
because there are people who love them enough to guar-
antee their continued existence, but also because they conv
stitute an essential part of the fabric of our American
culture Thev stand for humane learning, for the importance
of the individual as a learner and a deer, for the sacredness
of life, and for those essential values which are the ei
delice of mature Christian civilization.

.We hope that these days will be a source of joy and
of great satisfaction to all “llO are here, We are glad you
have come and shall do our best to make your visit a high—
light of the year.
