Grinnell duo win debate tournament in nation’s capital

First victory for intercollegiate
squad comes at national invite

By Courtney Sherwood
Editor—in—Chief

A strange secretive aura permeates the
world ofdebate. Mat Matt '03 and Gabe
Rosenberg ’03,
should know. Asked
what they did while
not debating at the
American Universiry
Capitol Classic last
weekend, they smile
knowmgly at one an-
other and refuse to
answer.

“A lor of stange
things happen when
you're nor debarmg,“
Rosenberg says.

Pressed for details,
Marr’s eyes become

glassy. “I'd never been to D.C., and I loved
it," he says. “We talked a lot about the val-
ues of our founding fathers."

Regardless of what odd happenings
might have taken place
between debates, how-
ever, one thing is cer-
tain: during the tour-
nament itself, the pair
soundly defeated scores
of teams from other
prestigious colleges and
universities. These
schools included NYU,
Cornell (President
Osgood’s former em»
ployer the two are
quick to point out) and
Colorado College.

or, as Rosenberg
puts it, “We crushed a

Discrimination alleged by
prof in lU tenure case

By Sky Eilers
IOWA CITY, Iowa ,.

obiagele Lake, a University oflowa as-
sistant professor of anthropology, says she
may seek legal action against the university
ro appeal whar she depicred as a racisr de-
cision that denied her tenure.

A press conference has been scheduled
ror Monday by Lake, who says a "racisr"
decision was made in 1997 denying her rhc
promotion, Lake, who is Black, asserts that
race could be the only reason she was de
nied renure based on her qualifications that
were at least equal to renured professors.

"in the 30 years that the Department
of Anthropology has been in existence,
there has never been a tenured professor of
African descent," Lake said.

Linda Maxson, the dean ofthe College
of Liberal Arts, denies that race IS involved
in any decisions made by the renure come
mittee.

"All renure decisions are made srricrly
on the information at hand," she said.
"Race never enters into it,"

Applications for renure ar rhe U1 are
generally considered after rhe candidate has
taught for five years; the criteria are teach
ing, service and publications, Lake said.

"There are faculty members in the an—
thropology department who had fewer pub-
lications when rhey applied for renure, but
their applications were granrcd," Lake said.

Applicanrs are judged differently be-
cause of race, and the departments that
made rhis decision only emphasized the
negative, she said.

"The claims were that my reaching was
inadequate, but a majority of my student-

evaluation forms and reviews of my port-
folio by orher renured faculty were posi»
tive," L’ikc said. "When there is no other
reason ro take a negative parh, then it be»
comes racist."

Applications for tenure are ﬁrst re
viewed wirhin rhe faculty members depart—
menr, then by rhe college's renure com-
mittee and by the Office ofrhe Provost.

"it‘s not appropriate to talk about per
sonal cases, bur 1 can say we wenr rhrough
normal university procedures wirh rhis
case," said Ul Provost Jon Whirmorc,

Doug Midgett, a U1 associare profese
sot ofanthropology, said that ifa tenure
decision is negative. a faculty member can
remain on staff at least one year.

"When you don‘r ger tenure, that
means you're gone," Lake said. "You can't
try again."

As a result, she said, she is being "forced
out" after the completion ofthis semester.
The Iowa Civil Rights Commission is in-
vesti§ting her case, but no legal action has
been taken yet, she said.

A group called me Collective Move-
ment for Equality formed in response to
Lake's denied renure. Its purpose is ro raise
money for Lake's legal funds; the group
includes six members that are current or
former Students of lake's.

Marisa Cummings, a U1 senior and a
member ofthe committee, said there was
no just reason to deny Lake tenure,

"She reaches rhings others may not want
to talk about, and that's why she has re»
ceived unfair treatment," Cummings said,
"I think she is an excellent teacher and that
this is a racist policy."

lot ofpeople pretty brutally”

Debating in parliamentary-style debate,
they took the tournament arguing against
gun control, despite each actually being in
favor of gun control.

"lr’s easier ro argue againsr your values,"
Marr says. “You are better at sorting out
feelings from facts."

Rosenberg corroborates. “If you believe
in what you’re arguing you’ll be arguing
from the heart and not the head,” he
says."But I think it's useﬁilly to do that

anyway, just so you can think’critically
about your beliefs,”

“This is a great step forward for our
program," Rosenberg said. “Many students
at Grinnell don’t even know that we have
intercollegiate debate. Now not only will
they know we exist, but they will know we

are proving to be a narional power.”

With Marr and Rosenberg both in rheir

first year at the college, the possiblities for
Grinnell debate are great.

Column: If at first you don’t
succeed, lower the standards

By Jcssc Ammerman

IOWA CITY, Iowa .. ours is a narion that
prides itself on the high moral and inrcllocrual
srandards that it scrs for its citizens and public
ﬁgures alike. Being No. 1 ain'r easy, after all, and
everybody musr mecr the stiff challenges rhar
await rhem in order so be the best mey can be.

Unless, ofcouree, they happen ro arrend high
school. Standardized tests, which I'm sure we
have all pleasurably experienced, have long been
judged as gauges of intellectual ability for stue
dents ofall ages. They're still in vogue, and many
srares have even made use ofnew, even rougher
rcsrs ro measure the capabilirics ofour counrry's
brighr young minds.

The results have been rarhcr impressive. in
Arizona, according to the New Yin/r Times, 89
percenr of high school sophomores failed the
state's math test, in Virginia, meanwhile, only 7
pcrcenr orirs schools had srudenrs who met state»
resring srandards.Th1ngs have gone so horribly
wrong, in fact, that New York has had ro lower
its passing grade or a college prep English test
and Wisconsin has withdrawn enrirely a rcsr re
quired for high school graduarion.

And a nation srands proud. The next genera.
rion of leadership, according ro such rosrs, can
barely read or wrirc. This has not gone unnoc
ticcd by the parcnrs, reachers and adminisrrarors
who have been left awesrruck by rho figures.
What‘s wrong here?, rhcy say. some say that
reachers have nor been given adequaro time to
prepare students for the rosrs, many ofwhich are
fairly new. Miscommunication between states
and schools, .r appears, could be the eulpnr for
students' dismal failures.

Meanwhile, schools in most srarcs (Iowa is
an exception) are tcversmg course and easing the
srandards for their students. "People are
