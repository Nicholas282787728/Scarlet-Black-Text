SGA gains experience, direction

BVJ. FRANCIS Buy:

In the Oct 10 issue of the SCiB, a quarter—year review of
SGA showed an organization hampered by inexperience, yet
promising increased productivity, as members grew accustomed
to their roles in SGA. With the fall semester over and spring
semester underway, SGA has excelled in certain areas and
struggled in others,

A general lack of experience continued to be cited as the
main problem throughout the remainder of last semestei. “I
don't think there was good leadership or direction," said Jamar
land Senator Dylan O'Donoghue '11, “And there wasn’t a lot
ofcxperience."

At the start of the year. the 10 members; of Cabinet had a
combined two years ofscA experience, and only three of the
18 elected senators had previous experience on Joint Boattl,

For the majority ofrhc year, op ns were few and far be
tween during Joint board cssions, which, according to Loosehr
cad senator Phil Hagen 10, decreased from an average length
of over three hours in '07-’08 to about an hour and a half this

past semester. “The absolute lack of contention over any issue is
kind ofshocking," Hagen said. “I don't know how many times
there has actually been a question of how the votes actually
going to end up."

SGA Vice President of Academic Affairs julie Hoyt: ’09
said the minimal discussion at Joint Board raised questions as
to whether the meetings were for genuinely addressing student
needs or simply passing SGA-borne resolutions. ”In years past
we’ve had the asshole or the devil’s advocate that sits there and
gets people thinking,” Hoyc said. “That has been a missing
component of[last semester's] Joint Boaid."

But some weie quick to point out that this year‘s SGA Cab-
met and Joint board alrived with a purposefully mole relaxed
attitude than last year, and that comparisons between this year’s
and the previous year's SGA, headed by former SGA President
Megan Gociing ’08, were unta .“A lot ofpeople really tirdn't
like last yearithey thought it was too aggressive and too cons
tenuous." said Hagen. “The cabinet came rn saying they were

to new vice president

Position signals commitment to diver

bv MANDO MoNTnNo

Though the majority of recent news coming out of the
President's office has focused on budget problems and spends
ing cuts, over break there was rare news ofexpansron.

The week before the start of spring semester. the College
announced the addition of a new vice president position with
the promotion ofElena bemal '94 to vice president ofDivetsity
and Achievement. Bernal, who was serving as special assistant
to the president for Diversity and Achievement, will change
more in title than in role.

“We're not changing the job very much, we're recognizing
that things are going well and giving her a title that ﬁts with
the test of the liberal arts college," said President Russell K.
Osgood.

Bernai's role as vice president is similar to her previous post
as speeial assistant Bernal continues to oversee campus diver—
sity enrichment programs such as Posse and Grinnell Drversity
Leaders Program, to work with faculty in hiring and marntarnr
ing diverse faculty, and to set up administrative accountability to
ensure that admissions engages in multicultural recruitment.

Bernal said that while her role may not seem to change much,
it icpresents a step towards an increased emphasis on diversity.
“It’s not one particular thing I’m doing,"Eernal said of her po-
sition. “But
it‘s monir
t o r i n g
across sevr
eral areas,
how dis
vtrsity and
C q u a l i r y
come into
play on
campus."

change in
B e r n al ’s
position is that she will now supervise the Ofﬁce of institu-
tional Research, which is conducting research for the campus
Climate Project, an investigation of student, staff and faculty
attitudes regarding diversity on campus. Bernal previously was
the head of Institutional Research at Bryn Mawr College in
Pennsylvanra before she came to work at Grinnell last year.

Bernal will continue to work as the administrative liaison
to students for the Washington, Dc. and Los Angelcs Posses.
"She's been sort ofa stronghold for nie,"said L A, Posse meme
bet Steven Cross ’11.

Osgood said that with Betnal’s promotion he hopes Betnal's
will bolster the environment ofdiversity on campus. “Successful
diversity is a cultur in which people are comfortable with the
differences between them and learn from them,"hc said.

”We’re not (hanging [hejob very much,
we’re retagniziilg that things are going
well and giving lit’ft’ﬂ title that ﬁts with

alcohol policy and the structure of Student Staff, and a pet-
ceived lack of transparency in the administrative decision-mak-

faculty members submitted a damning letter to the editor in the
seal; in which they condemned actions surrounding Andrews
release.

After an outpouring of student frustration, SGA Cabinet
organized a Campusrlvide open forum at which administtas

some common ground, brrt ended on a sour note when Doughr
