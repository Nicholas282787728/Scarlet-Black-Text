announcement published in the same issue.
But Louise and othels pursuing MRS

Berry Carnes, president of the Women’s Self
Government association, limited their efforts
by setting a 10 p.m. curfew for women on

Other female Grinnellians were less den

Daring to live loud and proud

How dare you mock Inc? My. body is mine, and
howl choose to display it is my own god-given right.
1 will conform neither to your puritan ideals ofdress.
nor your hypocritical and bookish sense of fashion
propriety. i am a beautiful snowflake, and I will re-
main beautiful in whatever I choose for my studying
apparel—nothing you can say or do will ever take
that away from me Iwill strut my stutf however and
wherever I choose, 1 will love my body; I will refute
the matrimony, i will bask in the glory of Bllrling's
bibliographies, Bibles and bestsellers in all the corn-
fort and support of my black, bitty, bodacious, bulge-
bearing boxer-briefs. This is Pantsless Wednesday

The plight of the Lilluputitms

Let’s talk about the salad bar and the wok sta-
tion and how they're matte for people with really
long arms. IfI want any items in the mythical Lnsl’
Row At The Salad Bar, I basically have to launch
my entire torso into the vegetables. it's really awk-
ward to balance on one foot, duck under the sneeze
guard and shove yourself in there far enough to
reach the elusive yummies. \ou really have to, like,
stretch hard to grasp the items with the tongs, and
often you dont get very many, so you have to do it
many times, and then people Oct all impatient and
you know theyre thinking, Oh God, not another
small one.

Its tough, living in this world marle for tall
people.
