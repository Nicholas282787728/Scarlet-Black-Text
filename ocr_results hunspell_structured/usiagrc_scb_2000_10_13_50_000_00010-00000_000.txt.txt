SurpresSing
. democracy

To the Editor.

1 watched the presidential ”debate," and tound u to be
little more than a very predierable, 90-minute infomercial for
Bush and Core. The candidates delivered prepared remarks and
postures, with little substance, and no discussion ofﬁlndamcnr
ral issues,

Both Bush and Gore support huge increases in military
spending, the death peneiry, corporate welfare, and globulin»
non, They borh are accepting hundreds ofmillions ofdollars
in unregulated campaign contributions, while promising cant.
paign finance reform sometime after they are elected. Trust us,
they say!

The exclusion ofRalph Nader from the presidential do»
bares is an affront to democracy Clearly, Bush and Gore are
afraid of the issues that Nader would address. since he chale
lenges the corporate control that both ofrhcm represent.

A long list otAmerieans from across in the political spec.
trum have said that Nader should be given the chance to do
bate the major party candidates. This list includes: Senators
Russ Feingoid, Paul Wellsrene and Barbara Boxer, former Sena.
ior Howard Baker, Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Governors
Jesse ventura and Cary Johnson, former Governor Mario
Cuomo, tormer thirdrpan’y presidential candidates John Ander.
son and Barry Commoner, and media hgures Brian Lamrn.
John McLaughlin, Don imus, Phil Donahue, and William F.
Buckley. Polls have consistently shown support for having Nader
and pat Buchanan in rhe debates. A September 13 Zogby poll
showed that 587 percent want Nader to participate in the presi»
denrial debates, while only 34.2 percent agree with the deci—
sion otrhe Commission on prmidenrial Debates and major party
campaigns to exclude him. A FoxNewslo pinion Dynamics Poll
from July showed that 64 percenr ofrhe American people want
to see Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan m the debates, a number
that was duplicated in many informal
polls, including an NBC News Today Show Poll. in addition,
many newspepers have edirorialited in favor oflncluding Ralph
Nader in at least one presidential debate. These include the
Wm/Jingmn Pail. the Stank Timer, rhe Holman chronic/e, rhe
LA, Times, the so, Fmrftiira Chronicle, The Sr. print Pioneer
Fees, The Chrixti/m science Mani/0r, and the Worcester Fltgmm

. d Gazette.

Why are Republicans and Democrats suppressing dcmoc»
raeyz Don't they think we can see rhrough their rranspareur
raciics?They wouldn‘t even let Ralph Nader into the audience,
even though he had a ticket! What are rhey afraid of?

Increasingly, people are turned offby this charade. As evr
deneed by rhe 12,000 people who attended the recent Nader
rally at the Target cenrer, both old and new voters are seeing
that they have a genuine choice rhis year. Ralph Nader rakes no
PAC money. and he is addressing the real issues, He deserves
your vote!

Opinion

Cheney cements
bigots for Bush

seemingly overlooked in rhe media evaluation of Dick
Cheney is his effect in securing the votes of the extreme right
for the Republican ricket.The national press has asked Cheney
about his congressional voting record on issues ranging from
Head start to Cop-killer bullets. Cheney liberally alters his p0»
sirion on each controversial vote. except his vote against a reso—
lution in tavor ottreeing Nelson Mandela.

in defending his Mandela vote, Cheney invokes "Com-
munism." Why does cheney continue denigrariug Mandela?
Because Mandela is Black! Cheney's stance reassures and 5:»
cures the votes of die bigots and racists,

Cheney creates a buffer between the extreme right and
Bush. Thus, Bush trees himselfro appeal to fiscally conserva-
rive wlrire middle class voters who otherwise will not tolerere
bigotry With Cheney, Bush gets she vote ofrhe cxrreme right
AND finesses the vote of otherwise sensible, kind conserva—
tives,

Perhaps the effect ofrhis plan is what Bush means when
he relies about "soft Bigotryl" Except, in whose cynical lexicon
is bigotry ever ”soft”?Tl-le bigotryofrhe Republican party is as
masterfully pernicious and present today as it was in 1988 when
Bush-rheefathnf invoked Willie Horron, an antic for which
Bushrthccﬁthef‘x campaign adviser (Lee Arwarer) later :lpuio»
giaed, but Bush—the.father never.

Like father, like son. The fruit doesn‘t fall far from the
tree.

Misdirected activism

Dear Editor,

Having graduated from Grlnneii in 1999, I am more than
glad to see that Grinucll srudents are upholding the campus
strong reputation for activism and public awareness 1 would
like to say though, in response to a recent article applauding
activism against Gore and occidental Petroleum, that promote
ing “blind" activism is one issue and promoting activism which

, toeuses on the “real problem“ is e completely separate issue.

While 1 was at Crinnell and in the timesince I have gradu-
ated from Grinnell, I have noticed that us. corporations are a
particular favorite ofianipus activists. For example, in the case
against Grinnell students vs Gore, occidental er at, it is my
personel feeling that while the motives behind the activism
ageinsr Gore and occidental are rock»so|id. the focus of rhe
acuvism is misdirected, To avoid bearing around the bush, 1
would like to bring to your notice rhat us. consumers, who

Where are our prion'tis?

One of the things Grinnellians like to feel supen'of
about is that we don't let athletics take priority over
academics, Well, that might be about to change.

The new athletics complex north of campus is sup-
posed to include lights for sports teams that want to
practice after it gets dark. A ﬁne idea, right? But
there‘s one problem. The observatory is located north
of campus too, and, not surprisingly, astronomers need
dafk to do theif work.

"Putting lights on those ﬁelds would effectively
kill the astronomy program, as we will no longer be
able to use the observatory as much," said physics
major Ellie Raulefson ’02. The eafly evening hours are
an ideal time for astronomical observation, but with
the lights, obsefvation would be impossible.

So for the athletics department‘s convenience,
we're about to kill off an entife academic discipline?
Where are our priorities, again? .mk Gable

Buildings are funny, eh?

One building is for the arts, one for hard science,
and one for social science, essentially. Bucksbaum is
full of nooks and crannies, each unique and largely
unconnected, some of them uncannily uninhabited
but none unpleasant.

Some parts of Noyce are sleek, modern, and please
antlooking others are ancient cement-andheatduet
dungeons. And the whole thing is duct—taped together
into a labyrinth oi awkward corners and random doors
that nobody except science majors can navigate. But,
if you know the building well, every area pretty much
connects somehow to every other. ARH is three H's on
top ofeach other. Allthe lines are straight; each ﬂoor
pretty much operates independently, sharing with the
others only a couple of central veins. Movement around
the building can be slow, butis fairly straightforward.
No room here to shove it down your throat. . . but

think about it t . . —M1‘chael Andersen

To Write a rant

I’ve only recently decided to even participate in
this at all (by which 1 mean the wnting ofa Random
Rant for this column), and already have i discovered
the mindrwrenching difﬁculty of the endeavor: to write
something ofnotable intellectualsubstance, yet which
maintains enough approachability such that anyone
would wish to read it, is indeed a task of near
Herculean measure; even more challenging, however,
is the quest to do all of this in less than 142 words
(although the Opinion Page editor has informed me
that 1 can exceed this limit if i absolutely must, 1
would pfefef to stay within the conventional param
eters), but i feel that 1 am up to the challenge. Given
my previous accomplishments in writing, this tiny
smattering of words, 1 tell myself, should be a walk in
the park; thus: i am e Grinnellian.
