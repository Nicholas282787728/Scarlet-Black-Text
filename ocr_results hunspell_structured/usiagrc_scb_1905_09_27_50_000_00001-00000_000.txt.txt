PERRY MAKES TOUCHDOWN.

The Fast High School Captain Scores on
the Varslly~Grlnnell States only
in Second Halt

Grlmlell hall the ﬁrst game of llle
the
Marshalltown high school team byit
score oizt to h.

season Saturday by Lleledting

At the end 01 the
ﬁrst half the score stood (i too in favor
oi the high school and for a time the
Grinnell rooters telt Lllilt their high
hopes tor a winning team had been
blltsterl and that all these (lope stories
concerning the brilliant prospects and
a victorious season had been merely a
delusion and a snare. But the second
haltis always the Grinnell hall’ and
the team clearly demonstrated the
fact that they had real championship
possibilities. Four touchdowns were
made in rapid succession and only the
shortness of the Lillie prevented a larg-
er score.

The game opened witharush and
iii a [cw minutes the varsity had
worlrcd their way to the high school
ten yard line. On a tumble. Perry
seized the ball and sped down the iicld
scoring a touchdown belbrc thc Grin-
uell surrad radii/.011 what had happen-
ed. Johnson kicked goal and the score
stood Mar-slialltown h. Grinnell 0.

The remainder of the half was de-
void of sensational features neither
team Mrs able to gain consistently
and the llall‘ coded with a ball in wide
ﬁeld. The high school. however, were
beginning to weaken and calls l‘or
time were trcuuent.

1n the second hall the scarlet and
blach came to the trout and scored
four times in the riitecn minutes or
play Gaunt anti Bleaniastei- were

ilinost entirely to make thc gains
anti a play in either direction netted
a gain or scvcrul yards. A laughable
l‘eaturc occurred in this hall when
Bleamasier scored a touchdown lrom

by the or oral. liloamaster, however,
was not discouraged and on receiving
the ball madc exactly the sameplay
again. to the grout joy oi the motors.
Cllangcslli tllelme—un were frequent
and Trainer Fisher gave about all the
substitutes a chance to play. Time
of hulvcs was lil'teen minutes.

Although irrmblcs were irequeutyet
Grinncll has eve reason to reel satis-
lied with sotrrr sexhibiiion. The
team showed that they were willing
to woilt and tlrat they were not ”rilllt»
ter. ’i AL time their interlerence was
lilst class and they showed mid-season
lorm. Thc warm weather handicap-
ped the men greatly and prevented
Fast work. On next Saturday Des
Moines College will appear on Ward
Field to do battle. Little is linown
of their prospects except that they
are coached by an old Griunell man,
Bernie Hamilton, holder or the state
record in the broad jump. A good
game, however, can be expected.

OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.

l

‘A Few Speculaunns Concerning the

Successor of President Bradleyi
Trustees Meet Tomorrow.

Ontlle eve of the meeting or the
board ol'Ll'llslees, there is almost as
much excitement in Grimicll as there
was in Portsmouth during the
session in thc peacc commissioners.
The real cause {or this excitement lies
in thc ract that a report has been cit»
crilatcd that when the trustees cone
ienetoincri-ow morning in a special
session that a committee consisting of
Mr. Roger-Learnt, Dr, Albert Show
and Rev. ll. W. Tllttle. will l‘momr
mcnd a successor to Premium Dan
1‘. Bradley. The rumor has been per-
slstent in college circles for several
days past although some or the wise
oncs shake their heads and give it no
credence,

It is generally believed that the
presidency of Iowa College will again
he tendered to Dorm Frank R. San.

tary or the Congregational Publishing:

quarters in Boston it will be re-
mcmbercd that lican sanders was the
choice hi the trustees in Mill. but he
ilcclincd because of his position at
Yale. Lust year ho was compelled
to lc Yale on account or the luck or
iunilsto endow the chair and accept

sieved that he will accept this turn,
