“Cave Dwellers" Nol “Spun Candy;"
ls “Small Coin For A Great Need"

by Liane Ellison

We were led to believe before ”Cave Dwellers” took place that
it was antic theatre. spun Candy that would dissolve before we
swallowed It. Saroyan is certainly no New Prophet, and the play
is, neither Great Messéwe nor Great Drama It is designed to be a
little thing and deSDite a kind of pretense of language, has things
to say about this llttleness being bi!

He has it that all the worlds
a stage, or rather, the stage is
all the World, the name of the
ruined thcatrc awaiting its end.
in the ruin of the World livcs
an ex»clo\vn who also played
Lear, the great father, and who
is called Father, King, Madman,
Clown, He lives in a sense of
excited degradation (performer
to beggar). a selfishness of
fear and a generosity of love.

A dying actress, the Queen
and mother. lives with tho King.
She also is afraid but proud.
When the exigencies of staying
alive seem to demand a human
circle, she breaks away saying,
“I intend to stay alive as if this
were the morning of the first
day," and calls their circle “The
motheriand the father—of vioA
lence.” She is the one who
wants to open the door to the
strangers as an "act of love."

There is also a prichightcr
who is fighting hls guilt of
failure and who thanks some-
who in the roof of the theatre
when he brings together the
Girl and her lovcr in his cf—
fort to be self-redeemed. A
Girl wanders in, loves the
prizefighter (which does rc-
deem him) but falls in Love
at first glance with a. mutc
milkman and becomes a wo-
man (so says the text.) At
the pitch of night coldnesska
family with a trained hear
comes in, a baby being born
in a highly burlesque sccne.
By way of, plot there is the
challenge voiced by the queen
of being involved in something
and thus transformed, and when
as ed what her problem is, she
says, “survival and love."

The point of Lhe whole
play is love. “What is the
secret of the theatre?” asks
the Girl, and the Queen rc-

plies, “Love, of course. with
out love, pain and failure are
pain and failurc, nothing
more. But with lovc they are
beauty and meaning them-
selves."

The play raises a number of
interesting and emotional quess
tians, but there arc other ques.
tions about the excellence of
Sarovan. although he proves a
slightly better playwright in thc
tcxt than he did on tho Grinncll
Stage,

Most important to this play
is the illusion of a world unto
itself. It has an allegorical.
dance-like quality that was
well framed in the guitar-cal—
liope music, The producers of
Grinnell plays unfortunately
do not know the importance
of a stage picture. Because
the play is set in this world
called a ruin is no reason to
make a distressingly grimy
stage of Tonncsseo Williams’
hack-alloy realism. The pov-
erty could have been suggest
cd cleanly :(nd with color, and
the enchanomcnt might have
been more potent as proved
by the magically-lit droam
scene.

Although the play dragged to
begin with and in spots through-
out, there were intensely mov~
ing spots, most of them made
by Margaretha Holinstrom as
the Queen. She gave the part
a certain grandeur of soul along
with dignity and warmth so
that her World was quite real.
Floyd Hughes as Gorky,
hear, was her runner—up,

and elocutionary, Bob Camp~

pleasant but somewhat dutiful

and as the father handled thc
Gorky scenes with humor and

what he was doing. Paul l-hok.
cnstad needed to he rougher.
more musciilarly ruthless so
that his postponing tho and
of the World would have hcon
the appropriate if temporary
miracle.

At one point in the play the
King speaks of ”A small coin
for a great need” in a way
this play can bc considered a
small coin for a great need,
something wherein small things
implicate greatness, 1t disturbs
me that the drama crew was
willing to overlook the words
to say it was all a toy, so de-

liberately to devalue the small
coin.
