A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

Let if. be understood in the begin-
ning: truth is beauty; and this is
a column of true beauty.

That streak of wind you sow
leaving town Monday morning
was most of the Zephyr stair
breezing after the Rocket. We're
not denying that it was a good
idea, but we are concerned about
the ego that made them think
their stutr would rate a callrdown
from the administration.

And speaking or the admin [71’
tion, we never thought we would
have to contend with dose
iiiindediiess on,the part of the
dean of men, he who remembers
practically everything. But it
seems that Dean 13., after ilivit~
ing sundry young women to
RIDE over to the quad with him.
suddenly breezed back i: c the
room with the statemen "I Ior-
got. I walked today."

There‘s one in every hall, \Vhrul
Jorgeiisen rapped at the door, the
mail within wanted to lirlow who
was there. “Beatty,” snapped
Jorgenseli. “Well, there ain’t no
cars in here,” said the bright
one.

We note with some interest that
the student leaders are about to
take up the problem of “men at
vespers." Tsk. Tsk. That's no

JOINTS AND COUPLINGS: This
Brake-Black combination looks to
us like two hearts might be beat-
ing in doublestime. Shall we
change the “double" to “two” and
save you the trouble, Miss Black?

say, is getting too, too possessive.
If you don’t believe it, watch
the way he drags Iriend Nola

the play into the fallacy of think—
ing that the play is better than
it actually is. Until one ponders
them the beautifully polished and
altfully simple philosophical res
ilections of the' stage manager
sound profound, and one is likely
to mislahe thc novelty of a play
without the conventional scenery
for e lhstlng and revolutionary
innovation in the history of the
drama. Even while watching
the per-Ioriiiarice, however, one
wonders why, if the imagination
of the audience is asked to cone
vei-t the top of a ladder into an
upstairs room and an iiiipioviscd
trestle into a soda fountain, it
cannot also be counted on to
translate modern dress into the
fashions of the 1900's. Anomar
