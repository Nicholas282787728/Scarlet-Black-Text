Septi 5, 1986

By Christine Black

When your dorm '5 fire alarm shocks you
out of bed at 3:00 in the morning, when
your roommate can only study ii Conway
Twitty is singing in the background, or
when your curling iron scorches your ear
leaving third degree burns, you call your
Resident Advisor. Gazing out of Burling's
windows, do you wonder, “How will these
new R.A.’s handle it all)” Well, have no
fear; the four Resident Advisers hired this
year can coniront anything short oi
speeding bullets, locomotives and tall
buildings, Since the immediate goal of the
new staii members is to get to know the
students, here is a rough description of the
Fab Four. But if you really want to get to
know them, visit them in person

Steve Langerud, the resident advisor oi
Younker and Smith halls. hails from
Forest City, Iowa. As an undergraduate,
‘he double-majored in psychology and an
thropology, then pursued his MA in
counseling with an emphasis on college
students Steve has held jobs at U.N.l, in
iinancial aid counseling, academic advis»
ing, career development, and crisis in-
terVention.

Steve shares Younker’s ILA, apartment
with his wife of three weeks, Karen
Veerhusen. She uses her MA, in Special
Education at Fairview Elementary where
she teachers handicapped preschoolers.
As for private time, Steve says that
students respect his locator board when he
doesn’t wish to be disturbed

Phame Camarena, the Resident Advisor
of Haines and James halls, is irom San
Jose, CaliIornia. He received his BA. in
sociology from the University oi Southern
Calilornia in Santa Barbara and his M.A
is still in progress at Penn state. He is on
an official leave of absence because he was
burned out. One of the main reasons
Phame chose to become an EA. is the
great deal oi people orientation which he

missed in school. He tries to ,lead a
challenging liie which benetits other peo—
ple besides himseli.

His past experience illustrates his desire
to be around people Phame has worked as
a resident assistant, which is a combina-
tion oi an R.H.A. and sa. He has received
educational training ior counseling college
students about their sexuality and stress
levels. In addition, he taught a course in in-
terpersonal skills in which he used an
educational environment to help people

develop as human beings. He encourages -

students to use the Career Development
Office for choosing a career without come
promising their values. Phame’s decision
to come to Grinnell is a result ola commit-
ment or his values. He was looking ior
someplace other than Pennsylvania or
California. He also wanted a position with
less administrative and disciplinary duties
and more personal interaction with
students.

The Resident Advisor for Main and
Cleveland this year is Beth Frumkin. She
received her B.A. in individual and Famir
l y studies from the University of Delaware
at Newark and her M.A. in Family and
Community from the Teachers College oi
Columbia University in New York. She is
presently working on her educational doc-
torate at the Teachers College. At
Delaware, she worked in aa pres
professional program as a Student Ad-
visor. Many people in the program go on to
become Hall Officers.

Choosing Grinnell involved a three-fold
process tor Beth. She originally read about
Grinnell in the Chronicle of Education, but
she wasn't sure if she was qualified
enough. At a national conference ior
higher education housing. she met Jim
Tederman. VicerPresident and Dean of
Student Affairs, whu impressed her as be-
ing easy to work with. Meeting Tom

During the late sixt|es, the social tur-
bulence of the nation affected Grinnell's
campus in many ways. in particular the
awareness of black students about their
responsibilities here. Black students
realized the necessity for more emphasis
on Afro-American culture in the cure
i-iculum as well as a campus-wide
awareness of the concerns and needs oi
black students. Grinnell College ads
ministrators and trustees were approach-
ed with requests to recruit more black
faculty members and students based on in
divldual abilities rather than quota re»
quirements, Although no iormal accusa-
tions were ever filed, efforts were made by
black students to ensure equitable finanr
cial aid allocations to minorities, By 1970,
students felt that not enough headway had
been made. and more radical action was
needed, According to Leslie Taylor, a 1931
Grinnell graduate and intern chaplain or

Grinnell College, approximately 10
members of the Concerned Black Students
(C.B.S.l held an allrday sit-in at Burling
Library which resulted in die presentation
oi to requests, Among these requests was
the Black Cultural Center.

Because oi the environment in which the
Black Cultural Center was conceived, the
center had a troubled childhood, but in
time. hostile emotions subsided.
Ms.Taylor says the attitude toward the
center between 1977 and 1981 was
predominantly positive. Many black
students like herseli saw the center as a
home. During her Grinnell academic
career, the center sponsored well-attended
activities, such as iilms, dances. poetry
readings and lectures, for the entire cam~
pus.

Uniortunately, many black students to-
day ieel that the center is ignored, and that
its purpose is misunderstood, This years

Peace Marchers Slept Here

By Christine Black

On July 21, 1986. Participants in the
Great Peace March for Global Nuclear
Disarmament stopped in Grinnell on their
trek across America. Having left Los
Angeles last March, the group expects to
arrive in Washington, D.C. around
November 15. The march is being made by
people volunteering to be witnesses ior
peace to promote the abolition of nuclear
arms. Approximately 250 marchers per
day participate at any given time. Some
people choose to march only part of the
way. Karin Connelly, an assistant at the
Wr' ‘ng Lab, and her lsryearrold son walks
ed thirty miles.

Since last January, Ms. Connelly has
travelled to England three times to visit
the Women's Peace Camp at the RAF base
on Greenham Common where American
cruise missiles are now being kept. The
women at Greenham have no permanent
facilities because they are evicted weekly
from their encampments surrounding
each gate of the base. In a letter to the
Chiswick Branch or the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament, Ms. Connelly come
pared and contrasted Greenham with the
peace march in America, pointing out that
“the peace march isn't like Greenham.
Here, there are many support vehicles, in
cluding semis "pulling portable toilets;
storage for tents and sleeping bag; buses
for the children‘s school; private vans. But
it's not like a middle-class suburb eiﬂ'ler. ,

marchers is important because it makes
them seem not so alien to average
Americans." According to Ms. Connelly,
many peace marchers expressed‘the opi-
nion that Grinnell sponsored one oi the
best programs ior them. A local iarmer
volunteered his grounds tor a picnic; and
the college oitered the use oi shower and
library iacilities.

The marchers didn’t raise much govern-
mental attention, but the cities along their
route recognized their presence. One goal
of the marchers was to raise individual
