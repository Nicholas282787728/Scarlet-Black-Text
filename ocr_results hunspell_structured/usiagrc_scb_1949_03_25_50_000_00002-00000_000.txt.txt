PRO and CON

Do you favor the present per centagc grading system .now in

use here?

Any grading system (numbers,
letters, colors, or odors) is Sat
isfactory if the categories used
are understood by all. l per—
sonally like both the percentage
and letter systems. Many prefer
the percentage system because
it allows a finer discrimination

than is possible in the letter‘
system. Finer discrimination is
possible in the sciences than in
the non-sciences. ii an instruc—
tor cannot make a fine distinc-
tion in grades, he can use only
multiples of 5 or even 10, if‘
properly spaced. The percentage
system serves both types of
graders, the letter system is less
flerible. Actually, any 'grading
system is secondary; what we,
need is better teaching and bet-'
ter study from our students! ‘

A satisfactory grading system
should meet certain require!
monts: (a) enough grade varia-'
tions to evaluate students ader
quately. (b) not so many that
the differences cannot really be
discriminated and give a false
impression of precision, (c) the
system must be in general
enough use so transcripts can be
evaluated by other colleges.
The present system fails at
points b and c.

A simple A, B, c, D, r sys-
tem would better satisfy these
requirements. Pluses and mine
uses are not transferred and so
are useless outside the college,
although perhaps advisable with.
in it. Whether faculty members
can differentiate more than five
grades of ability must be ex-
perimentally determined, but it
seems certain they cannot dif-
ferentiate forty as in the pres-
ent system,

Our question this week is:
What do you think of Co-ed
Cash week. and what are your
plans?

Marty Van Emden, Main 3rd

At last a girl will be able to ,‘

have as many or as few dates

as she wants or can afford. I'm -

planning to pay for coffee dates
(no steak dinners!) all day long
~at least as long as 1 have
nirkels.

Bill Springer, Rnwson 4th tower,
Co-ed Cash week, i do feel, is
the greatest invention since the
wheel. The reasons for this are
the troubles I’ll mention: since
the first of September I've been
on a pension; I've lost all my
money, I'm feelin’ low, two
guys from Dibble won all my
dough. So, for this cash week I
longingly yearn and hope all the
women have dollars to burn. My
closing words for this little verse
are hopeful, yearning, and very
terse: girls, DON’T BE TIGHT,
TREAT US RIGHT.

ratsy Milroy, naiues basement
I'm preparing for Co-Ed Cash
week by saving my nickels in an
old used beer mug. So far, I've
got 17 pennies and a Dewey buir
ton. I'll gladly buy some—um—
worthy male 17 cents worth of
gumdrops.
interviewer:
Dewey button?
Pat: Never!

of South campus as a possible
date.

1 think it’s a great idea. even
if some of us fellows do end up
the forgotten men. However, if
those little chickens on South
campus still have some of their
aggressive basketball spirit, of a
few weeks past, the week should
prove quite interesting.

Duakes has been shaving daily —
even as you and I. He's tried 'em
all — razor blades, we mean. Some
were better than others, but none
did what the ads said until — but
here’s his story: _
“Saw a man in the Pullman using
Pal Hollow Ground, He looked
happy. I asked about 'em. He lent
me one. Anrl I‘ve shaved happily
ever afterl"

Pal Hollow Ground. Say Pal Dou-
