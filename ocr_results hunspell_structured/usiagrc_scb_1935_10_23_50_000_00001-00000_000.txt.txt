Pioneers Get
in Condition
for Jays

Real Battle in Prospect
as Creighton Loses
Two‘Regulars

By Jim Bradley

with all Pioneers in first class
shape and Creighton weakened by
the loss of two regular players
through ineligibility, the prospects
of a knock-down drag-out battle
with the Jays seem certain for
Homecoming Saturday.

The loss of Captain Vincent An-
derson, 175 pound quarterback,
and Al Kubes, veteran 200 pound
tackle, will undoubtedly weaken
the Creighton aggregation, These
men and Richard Raschke, reserve
back, were ruled ineligible by
Bluejay authorities because they
were not in school during the sec
ond semester of last year.

Sock Third straight

Returning alumni will flock to
Grinnell to see their alma mater
fighting for a third straight vic-
tory and struggling to keep the
top berth in the Missouri Valley
league race. Such a record has
not prevailed in Grinnell for years.

The Pioneers, who knocked
Washburn from the running two
weeks ago. share top honors in the
loop standing with Tulsa univer-
sity, which also stopped the Icha-
bods, and Creighton.

Jay Record Impressive

The Bluejay record, which seems
the most impressive in the Valley
circuit. was marred last week by a
do tie with the Drake Bulldogs.
Creighton has defeated st. Louis
university and the Oklahoma Ag-
gies, held Rice to a 14-0 win and
tied Drake, while Grinnell dropped
one to Michigan state and won
from Central, Washburn, and
Carleton colleges.

‘The Grinnell men are in excel-
lent condition. Schlotterbeck and
Sampson, backs, who were injured
in the Carleton game, will be back
in the lineup. Fowler, regular
center, may also see action for the
first time since the Michigan state
game, Bauer received a bruised
shoulder in Monday’s scrimmage
and took only a light workout
Tuesday, but he will be on hand for
Saturday's tilt.

Auditing Plan

Voted Down
by Council

Duncan Names Committee
to Investigate Other
Plans

Decisions to refuse to adopt the
proposed control auditing system.
to appoint a committce to draw up
a new plan or revise the present
system, and to seek more adequate
faculty cooperation were made by
the members of the Student Coun»
cil last night.

"Since the students are obvious
ly opposed to the proposed plan of
a central banking and auditing
system, but still realize that there
is a problem to be met. we feel
that we are doing the only thing
by refusing to adopt the old plan
and by endeavoring to make some
other arrangements," Kent Dun-
can, prealdent of the student
Council stated last night.

Send Rmmnendation to Faculty

“We have recommended to the
faculty that whenever the student
auditor recommends the suspen-
sion of a student business man-
ager or treasurer, that the faculty
should take action on the case
within a period of three days,"
Duncan explalned.

"We have done this in order to
secure more efficient cooperation
between the faculty and the stu«
dents. and in order to be
able to enforce the orders of the
student auditor in regard to keep-
ing of student accounts."

Committee Members

The Council voted to appoint a
committee to draw up or revise the
present system for administering
student accounts. The committee
named by Duncan, is as follows:
Richard “Drake. president of the
Young Men's Christian association.
chairman; Jean M. ‘Smith, presi-
dent of the Women's Self-Govern-
ment league; William Maxeincr.
president of the Council of House
Presidents; Richard Pooley. town
men's representative; and Lewis
van Nostrand, student Council
recreation chairman.

This committee will report back
within a week or so, Duncan said.
