Becoming a mad scientist

After she graduates from Griunell, Willie SkarrJones
plans to work with things that go “fwoosh”, “boom" and
"fwararah". The Theatre major will be working with Mad
Science lowa,a group based in Dcs Moines that performs
fun science experiments for children. “Its sort of like Bill
Nye," said Skarqones. “We’re recruited for birthday par
ties instead ofclowns."

While a student at Grinnell, Skarrjoncs has been
seriously involved in independent theatre, livetactiou
roleplaying (LARP for short),
raising mice and Madagaseai
Hissing Cockroaches and deck-
ing out her room in glen/tint
the dark things.

Skiirrloncs is from Marshall,
Minn., where she did community theatre and dabbled in
freerforn‘i rolerplaying. With a father who was a selfrdcr
scribed nerd and a mom who ran the high school math
club, Skar-Jones came to Grinnell hoping to major in
Math or Chinese. but ultimately decided to do theatre
instead,

She was first cast in the Neverland Players sophor
more year, which she described as "massively cool." Since
then, shels enjoyed doing independent the “Theatre is
better when everyone is on the same level, she said. "In
independent theatre. the director is not above the actors,
and the actors aren’t above the crew. A lot more ideas get
ﬂowing that way."

Another place where Skartlones has let her ideas ﬂow
at Grinnell is in livceaction role-playing games When
she arrived in thnnell, she signed up for everything and
anything related to role-playing. A resident ofDag House
this year, she listed offa number of groups of'traclitiom
al weirdos." “Dag, SCA, Sci-fi club, Anime and LARP
have a massive amount ofovcrlap, “ she said, “but people
say that LARP attracts the crazy weirdos of role-play-

ingt" Skarrjoncs doesn’t mind that perception much. “In
a LARP you get to dress up as your character," she said.
“You get to create ‘iI reality, and create a character to par-
ticipate in a reality that isn't your own."

In that respect, she said, her extracurricular pursuit
13 not much different than her academic major. “A lot
of people don't recognize the connection, even Theatre
majors." she said. “But anybody trying to create theatre
should lookinto LARP."

in her postgraduate plans
with Mad Science, Skatrjones
plans to return to her love ofmath
and science, which she says are
poorly rcptcscntcd in elementary
schools today. “You get the mes»
sage in school that they‘re boring," she said, “and then you
don’t like them because of that.”

The Mad Science performing group combats that perr
ception by both educating and entertaining. Skar-Jones,
who has already begun doing some work for the group,
has learned how to make giant ﬁreballs in water cooler
containers, inﬂated balloons with dry ice, and made slime
using Borax, glue, and food coloring. With these experir
ment, she teaches kids about the properties of things like
sublimation, polymers, and hot air.

Skartlones describes herself as an “attention whore
who refuses to grow up," but she's willing to share her
interests with anyone who asks. Willie lists among her
favorite musicals “Fermats Last Tango," which is full of
puns and mathematical inside jokes. She can explain oiyjy
the Vampire slayer and the science of crying with equal
enthusiasmt From the theatrical magic ofLARP and int
dependent theatre to the scientific magic ofMad Science,
Skar-Jones finds ways to do what she wants and let others
in on it “I like perforniing,"she said. “I like to run around
and be silly and insane,"

Hannah Roman’s life at Grinnell has been
something ofa good collageiglossy snippets
ofintcrest in art, French and political activism
shufﬂed together into a personality ofcheerr
ful excitement, humility, casualness and dry
wt.

She can be found both in the printing
studio and at the peace march on Thursdays,
translating historical texts in southern France
or absorbing famous paintings in Holland.

She has been on Films Committee and
worked as a projectionist, ”which means
you’re prohahly mad at me" she said, but her
main interest is in ptintinaking.

“You feel like it's .1 process that hasn't
changed," she said,and there's something new
and exciting about creating the negative ofan
image before knowing how it will turn out.
“You never know what's going to happen"

Nonetheless, Roman claims she is more of

an art museum junkie than a major artist her-
self, and she talks about spotting it Vermeer
or Rembrandt in person like most Americans
talk about seeing pop stars.

Rather than lounging outdoors, she spent
a recent summer organizing photos in the
basement of the Met.

Roman went to high school on NYC’s
Upper West Side. at a
huge high school that she
“always hated."

Its math and science
focus was far rcmovcd
from Roman's main inter—
ests, but it was hotter than
the alternatives. It vlms

you would go to. she said,
“ifyuu wanted to go to public school and not
get shot."

But it was the sort of school where, in
her senior year, she was erroneously marked
absent from many of her classes because the
teachers had too many students to even know
who she was.

In the end, she had to have her teachers
“inark oft all these skips that didn't really hap-
pen in order to go to a prom I didn’t really
want to go to."

Despite first tossing out the Grinncll apt
plitation, she came out to visit, felt excluded
and awkward and realized she would ﬁt right
in.

Similarly, after dc»
titling that she was “so
done"with French in high
school, she ended up make
ing it her majol and stud-
ied in Aineanrovcnce
last year.

Still, Grinncll is a dif-
ferent world “I can’t get

sed to the personal ten-
u here." she says

Next year, she'll be heading back to
France, to take on a government job teaching
English, but this summer, she’ll be learning
how to drive,
