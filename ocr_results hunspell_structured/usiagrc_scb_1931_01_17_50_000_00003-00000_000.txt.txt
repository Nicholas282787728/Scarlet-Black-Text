Paul Blansharcl

Sees Orient as
Enemy in War

Socialist Predicts Coalition

as Economic Result
Here Thursday

,"There will be another World war
before people come to their senses,"
said Paul Blanshard, socialist and
Economist, in his lecture on “Inter-
national Economics and the Next
War" in Herrick chapel Thursday
evening.

Mr. Blanshard is director of the
city ofﬁce committee of New York
and lecturer for the League for his
dustrial Democracy. His visit here
was sponsored by the Grinnell Young
Men's Christian association.

”This war willbe even more terrible
than the last, even more horrible than
what is told in ‘All Quiet on the
Western Front!’ .

Greatest Creditor Nation

"The mere fact that war is not
wanted will not stop war, for econ-
omic Conditions can draw a. notion
into battle before she knows it. Even
now we are disliked very much in
Europe because the United States is
the greatest creditor nation of the
world. She thinks we are richer be—
cause of the war,

"However, the next war, as 1 see
it,” continued Mr. Blanshard, "will

‘ be between a coalition of the western
powers, namely France, Great
Britain, and the United states, on
one side and the Orient represented

, by Russia, China, and India on the
other.

United states thpithtlist-lc

"Russia is ﬁghting western capital-
ism, and disagrees with our view of
life. Little children in Russia. are be—
ing taught to hate capitalism as per-
soniﬁed by the United States.

“If we can’t put human welfare
above our nation, then we are still
barbarian. There will continue to be
war until the world can say, ‘Ahcve
all nations, humanity; above every
internatioal conﬂict, the international
mlnd‘."

Jonathan Danforth spent part
of the Christmas vacation With relar
tives in Chicago.
