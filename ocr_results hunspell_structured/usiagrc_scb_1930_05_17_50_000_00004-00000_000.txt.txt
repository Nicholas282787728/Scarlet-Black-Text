Brings Student, Professor into Contact

WINTER PARK. FLA.7The Roi-l
lins college conference plan of study,‘
which Pres. Hamilton Holt, former
editor of “The Independent,” likes tol
call "an adventure in new-fangled
education,” was inaugurated at the
Winter Park college four years age]
and has been a success from the view-
points of both the students and the
faculty.

Prof. Cecil F. Laveli, professor of
history of thought at Grinnell col-
lege, was a guest instructor at Rol-
lins during the 1927-1923 college
year.

One purpose of the Rollins system
is to bring the Student and professor
into closer contact.

Humml Contact Iacldng
"The chief besetting sin of our
modern colleges," according to Pres-
ident Holt. “is the lack of human
contact between professors and stu-
dents.
“When I left college and entered
my professional career as a magazine
editor, I was profoundly impressed
to find that my colleagues in the edi-
torial room. who never thought of
teaching me anything. taught me ev-
erything; while my professors at the
university. who were paid to teach
me, had taught me almost nothing,

“Yet my fellow workers in journ-
alism and my professors in college
were the same type of men—that is,
the members of each group were old—
er. abler, and nobier than myself: they
were socialists in their own fields, as
I was not; they were leading the in-
tellectual life on a high moral plane.

Students Passive

“As I pondered over this paradox,
the explanation seemed perfectly
clear to me. With my business as-
sociates I worked elbow to elbow,
desk to desk, eight hours a day, six
days a week. I was as active in my
work as they. Our relationship was
constant, continuous. co-operative, de-
mocratic. friendly, and human. With
my instructors at the university, how.
ever, I had no relationship except in
'the most formal and forbidding way.
'Wheh I was with them, under both
the recitation system at Yale and the
lecture system at Columbia, they
were active and I was passive Did
anybody ever get an education by
being a Sponge?

‘Two-Hour Conference Plan.‘

“I have tried to solve the problem
of bringing the teacher and taught
together by abolishing both the re-
citation and the lecture systems in
toto, and establishing in their place
the so-called ‘TWo-Hour Conference
,‘Plah.’ This proposal has for its pur-
-pose, and hopes to effect, continuous
consultation and ell-operation between
‘tlacher and student. The theory be-
:hinli this innovation is that the stu—
tdent’s mind is immature, that {rogue
rently he does not know how to study,
said that he most needs the professor
-when he is preparing his lesson and
not after he has learned or failed to
.learn it. .

“Thus the maximum impact of the
{instructor's personality will be exert-
»ed on the student’s mind at the time
-when it is most needed. This does
not mean, of course, that the teach-
.er solves every difficulty when the

student gets stuck. Only a foolish
'teacher would do that. It does mean.
however, that someone will be at
hand ready to aid the student when
aid is necessary. And it means that
the waste of unsupervised time for
which student life has become notor-
'iouS will be largely eliminated."

SCARLET AN

 

Would you prefer night football to
the regular nttcrnoon games in Grin-
ncll? .

rscu DougliisiNight football would
transform the warm October games .
into cool evenmg contests. This would
enable the spectators to enjoy the
gamc better and give relief to the
players, resulting in better played
games with less timeouts due to the
excessive heat. The players Wolllci
not be weakened by the heat under
this new system of evening games.

Carleton Humphrey—Night foot-
ball games here in Grinnell would
not draw much better than the
present afternoon games on account
of our small community. As most
of our out-ofrtowl-l games are play-
ed at night the lights would enable
us to he on a more even basis with
our opponents.

Meredith Heldridge—Night foot-
ball would draw larger crowds and
from a business standpoint it would
be a great success.

Edward Brown 7 Night football
would be a fine thing for Grinnell
college and would attract many
new fans from the surrounding
country that do not at present at-
tend our game .

Dorothy Sell 710. .seems that night
football games would involve too
much expense, in fixing the field,
etc., and there are many things
that the school needs so much
worse.

Frances Davis — Night football
games at Grinnell would draw more
crowds. They would probably pep
up the games, and if there is any-
thing we need, it is that.

Pioneers Meet
Bear Trackmen;
Fresh Compete

Varsity and freshman track teams
will swing into action this after-
noon, when the first string men face
Washington university at St, Louis
and the State Teschers' fresh pro-
vide the opposition for the Grimell
yenrlings st Cedar Falls. .

Coach Lester Duke’s warriors of
the cinder path will go into the fray
this afternoon as favorites to win
the meet, but all advance reports
predict a nip and tuck affair. The
frosh squad also holds an edge over
the pedagogue yearlings. and they
should come through with a victory
for Grinnell.

Washington's strongest events will
be in the field events, though Grin»
nell will be able to match those
points by their strength in the dis
tance runs. The litﬂe Pioneers
should take first places in nearly
every event with the exception of
the quarter-mile and the pole—vault.
