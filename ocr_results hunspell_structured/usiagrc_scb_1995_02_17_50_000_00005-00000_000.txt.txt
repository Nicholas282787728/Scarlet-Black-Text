Harris atmosphere

kills concerts
By ANDY HICKEN

Arts Columnist

AELSTROM, like any
other hand, needs its au
diencc to give back en-

ergy before they can give a truly
energetic show.

Unfortunately, the crowd atHare
ris last Saturday night was, for what-
ever reason,particularly disinclined
to dance or really express any sort of
excitementbeyondthe requisite clape
ping and heating at the end of each
song. So, though the boys tried their
best, and put on a very solid, tight
classicerock show (as they have all
three times I‘ve seen them) , they had
trouble pulling on a moving show.

Why? Well, the best theory is
probably that Harris was the problem.
The place is good for thyFair and
registration, Iguess, but its cavernous,
anLiseptic atmosphere kills concens.
Almost anything would improve it: a
paint job, lighting, orsome furrunire, or
somethingianythingA—toculdown on
the yawning expanse that hasn’t been
filled by any crowd during my short
time here. Not even Alli thraitm's
legion of disciples could make Harris
seem cozy.

"l'heendtesultisthatittakes agood
amount of effon from both sides, per-
formeisandaudience, to makeaHan‘is
show enjoyable. Luckily, afew people
ﬁnally decided to make the leap on to
the dance floor for PmidGoal, an Eau
Claire, Wisconsin-based alternative
band that followed Maelstrom. szt'd
Goat, who are unsigncd and just a
couple ofyears out ofhigh school, play
stmple, idealistic. hard rock in the vein

Replacements

Once the crowd made adecision
to really have fun for this band, the
difference was amazing, People went
crazy. It was like some kindofsoctoe
togiealanomaly. There wasmoshing.
There was an impromptu attempt at
forming a chorus line. There was
even public nudity (well, a couple of
women took off their shirts). The
rapport fanned between the band and
the crowd was so strong that Plaid
Goat's lead singer tell the need to
have his picture laken with one par
ticularly enthusiastic member of the
crowd, All in all, it was a very good
time to be had,

But I couldn't help feeling a
little sorry forMaclstmni. They were
definitely as good,muslcally,asPluid
Guatisomcwhatdifferentin style,
certainly, but classic rock isn’t ex-
actly unpopularatGrinnell. They put
on a good show. However, for some
reason, no one in the crowd made the
conscious decisron ,to exorcise the
Han-is demon and have a good time
in spite of themselves let's hope
that next time they do.

Senior creates surreal landscapes with postcards

By ELIZABETH MACKEY
Staff Writer

w on display at the Forum Art
Gallery are landscape paintings
by senior art major Bill Wells.

“It was mostly for my senior studio
project," Wells said of the tremendous
amountofartwork now on display. “I got
the [artwork] done for the class and then I
kept going for the show."

In the display, one can see Wells’
work evolve.

He started with pure landscapes,
Then Wells began painting different
versions of postcards. Tins way he

avoided having to compose the pictures.

”[heideaistohave the viewerpiece
them together," Wells said he wanted to
see “How much people interact But
then," says Wells,"l started painting on
top of postcards,"

Hence, the surreal postcards. Some
are painted on, while others have spots
erased out of them.

“I try to ﬁnd a spot that Will make
the scene more lively butwillnot destroy
it," said Wells of the postcards.

In addition to the smaller paintings.
there are two very large paintings which
Wells took from children's weather

books “I like the idea of using a
diagram fora source. Herc I‘m trying
toﬁgure outthewaypeoplelookatand
organize the world."

“What this exhibit shows is me
asking myself questions and then
coming up with new ones. I see this
as kind ofan experiment in problem
solving. The idea I ﬁrst had was to
do a lot ofsmall paintings and have
them all be in the same format and
by them being in the same format the
viewer could make direct comparie
sons between them, Ijust used land-
scape as the basis."

 

 

THIJ‘ WEEK AT THE MOVIE HOUJ'E

HAT can I say about
America's favorite
movie? Forrest Gamp

emerged this week with thirteen
Academy Award nominations, me
eluding Best Picture, Best Actor and
Best Director. What is it about this
movie that has captivated so many
audiences, becoming the highest
grossing ﬁlm of 1994?

Americans like to believe in simple
trudis. They like to believe that there are
bad guys and thereare good guyst that
being inherently good and following
simple maxims will get you the rewards
youdeserve. AslifeinAmen'cabecomes
more complex, the search for simple
solutions arises, beit ‘Gumpisms‘ or the
Contract with America concocted by the
Republicans. Forrest Gump fulﬁlls the
American ideal of the simple country
boy living by his simple code of honor
teamed at his mama’s knee and reaping
his rewards, not because he is good or
intelligent or hardworking or brave, but
because he does what he is told.

Directed by Robert Zemeckisartas
ter of slick but shallow movies (Dear/t

Becomes Her; theBack to the Future
trilogy),Forre:thmp is full ofdaze
zling special effects designed to
makeJaws drop, Amodern day fairy
taleabout a grown idiotehild, Forrest
Camp is a lot like a marshmallow:
sweet. and ﬂuffy, but dissolves the
instant you swallow it.

Cultural, performing arts films tackle

INNER or the Academy
Award for best foreign
film, The Night: of

Cabiri'a (thisweekend‘scultuml film)
features Giulietta Masinzi in the lead
role of a prostitute living on the cute
skirts of Rome.

Throughout the picture
Cabiria is disappoinled in love as
she is induced to act out her chcl’e
ished fantasies and then is
abruptly returned to reality. Nev-
ertheless she emerges from each
episode wtih enough strength and
hope to start again. The film has
a circular movement to empha-
size hercontinuinghardships and
suffering. She is a real and touch-
ing human being and a symbol of
humility, trust and hope, As one
reviewer from the New York Post
describes: “Cabiria’s indomitable
spirit. that automaticjaunty defie
ance that Champlin’s tramp used

to have is a very pure manifes-
tation of life, the more impressive
because found in an unpiomising
social level, and no less beautiful for
that." Fri (IayzttldSm ruddy al‘8:00

Berger, Little Big Man (this week’s
Performing arts ﬁlm) stars Dustin

Dan George. Bycmploying Hoffman
in a number ofroles including Cheye

Iftheinnul'nerable timesyouhave
heard Forrest Gump quoted haven‘t
tipped you off as to his character and
the plot ofthe movie, Forest Gump is
the story of an extremely slow-witted
mailashelivesthroughthemostmemo-
rable events ofthe60’sand 70’s. When
you ﬁrstwitness MriGump's worldit
is difﬁcult not to balk at the strange-
ness ofit, ofhow he sees things and at
the sheerluck that he possesses. Ifyou
stick it out though, Forrest and his life
willdraw you into the fold, mesmerize
and court you. The ﬁlmjust gets better
as it rolls through its two and a half
hours and you can’t help but end up
with a sincere feeling of warmth, or
even of joy at its close

Tom Hanks gives an even better
performance than his one in Philadele
phia (the one for which he won the
Oscar), and the rest of the east isjustas
great. The script is the most original I
have seen for quite some time and the
directoral effects are also quite clever.

enough. Bottomline: Wow! its why

Like Water for Chocolate

This ﬁlm is really weird but we liked
it. It’s based on a bestrselling hook
and is one of the best films to come
out of Mexico in years. It's apseudo»
fairy tale about a young Mexican
girl, her secret lover and her ﬁght
against her authoritarian mother. If
you’re looking for a slick, fast mov»
ing attention gmbber - this ain’t it.
But it more than makes up for its
slow pace with areally unique story,
some really funny moments, and a
“hot" sex scene!

Sunday at 3:00 pm.

The Professional

Uhhh this ﬁlm isn‘t in video stores
yet. Sowe watehedHelIrat’rer! While
this movieispmbably nothinglikeThe
Professional, we thought it was pretty
damn cool. Clive Barker’s cinematic
genius shines through in this macabre
tale of a mysterious box that opens
pomls to Hell. If you love horror.
you'll love Hellmtter! But since it’s
not playing this weekend, go see the
Projerriomzl (Craig thinks it’s about
an assassin or something)

Cartoon Festival

Hey kids: grab your sugar cereal and
run to the Harris Centerl SGA has
come up with something different and
thrown together a montage (seniors
note: GRE word) of animated adven-
ture. We didn’tﬁnd out exactly which
cartoons will be shown (We’re obvie
ously not getting paid for this), but we
both highly recommend going to see
this simply on principle. We're hoping
they show Voltron!

in, you guessed it. the Bronx, After
being taken under wing by a Maﬁa
boss, themaincharacter mustdecide
between the exeitingunderworld life
or the wishes of hishonest, working
class father (DeNiro). More than
just another mob ﬂick, this ﬁlm is
both funnyandinsightful. Plus,they
all have silly accents! (This coming
from a guy who lives in rural Kan-
525).
