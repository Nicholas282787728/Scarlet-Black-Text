Editor Lumhly Sltys New Policies Am
Are Iml-ugurmetl in First Num-
ber of The Stalwascr.

The opening number of the .unltcas—
er, which will be ready ior distribu—
tion on Homecoming, marks the in—
auguration or several new policies,
according to Harry Lanrbly, editor.
The tact that the crinnell college
comic is to be introduced to a stator
wide audience is responsible tor these
changes, which should give it a rrmch
wider appeal.

Au enlarged book—review section,
edited by Emil Bilha , will he one oi
the teatnrcs. Billrarz, uho u as a
member of the stall ol‘ the Des lloines
Register and Tribune last surnurer,
plans an enlarged and comprehensive
department of book-l‘c\icl\s. A num—
ber or able contributors will appear-
in the lirst issue, among them Dr.
Edward A, steincr, a national author--
ity ol immigration, Wayne card, a
contributor to the International Book
Review, and Henry czanne, iormerly
oi the Los Angeles Times. Many oth—
er intercstrng reviews have been \\ l'll—
ten tor the opening number.

Special attention has been paid to
the humorous department ol’ the Mal—
teaser, and the sketches, stories, jokes
and take-offs are or an unusually high
standard. In addition there is an
unusually large amount oi art worlt,
both by old contributors and first
timers.

Contrary to a recent impression
that seems to have gained some head—
way, states Mr. Lamhly, the ltlalteaser
is not a combination or Jlluto and the

alteaser. It is simply a larger Male
teaser, a strictly humorous publica—

'on, with the book. review and liter»
ry phases of the magazine attempted
in a larger scaIe. The primary 1mm

inues to he to entertain.

these sketches, is brought to the waste
ern world, an interpretation oi Oltl
Japan.

Tea drinhing iii the land oi cherry
blossoms has come to be a cult, and
is closely connected with philosophy
and art appro iatiou. It is an art
which symbolizes the poetic nature ol‘
the Japanese people. Tea nos 1 .t
introduced into Japan as .t rrrcdir' re.
Tea iii-inning soon became a polite
amusement and by the seventeenth
century it w. . a cult ulrich had petro-
trated the elegance or the noble
lreudior - well as the humble ont-
lage. Tea has come to mean all that

beautiful in Japanese lilc, ll
man is inclined riot to appreciate .lrl
he is said "no! to have enough tea in
lum,"

“When in our sleek complacency
ue try to understand the childish
ceremonies oi the l‘tast, we ran many
times tor lack oi sympathy. The,
Japanese are an artistic people who
thoroughly understand the gentle art
cl’ living Nothing could be more
character tic or their temper-merit
than the little tea room, set bath in a
secluded garden. Here in a spirit or
humility and sell illumination, they
come to sip tea and worship at the
shrine 01 some lovely masterpiece
which they are thoroughly capable of
enjoying.

“Could the West learn some ol the
eastern spirit or peace, it would proiit
greatly. In oirr stubborn ignorance
we miss the rich repast or beauty
which is ours tor the aslting, and lose
the great vision of hope, peace, and
intiuity that art has the power to
