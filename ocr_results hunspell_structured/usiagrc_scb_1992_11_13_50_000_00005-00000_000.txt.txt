Scarlet & Black 5

I'm a creep! I'm a jerk! Touch me I m sick!

by Tom Zlabinger

Alternative. Everyone knows what
titat means. It's the buzzword of tire 90s
It describes something different. Samar
thing not mainstream. Something unique
and cool to our generation.

Alternative parallels the 505' hip
Then there were hippies. We don'tJust
have one heat term to cover today's artltr
mainstrenrners. We havcmosllcrs.bom’d~
ers, punks, surfers. fretiks The list goes
on and on. Thetchas been an explosion in
thenuniberoftypesofpeoplcwhochoosc

to live agmml the grain.

Butnow this is all falling under one
umblclla called altcmtitive. Everything
is alternative. Everyone is running under
this shield and classifying themselves as
alternative This has gone on to a point
beyond perversion. Everything tliatonce
wasalternativeisnowmainstrenm. Look
at the record Charis, Two or three years
ago no one would have believed that
Guns and Roses. Metallica, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers. and Nuvanil wouldever be
on Kasey Kasem‘s Top 40. Two years
ago these blinds were all the music of

opposition frustration. and revolution.
Now they re “in" and cool.

There ts one big difference between
our generation's counterculture and the
counterculture of our parents' genera»
lion. There was not MTV in the 605.
thn yoti wanted to see aband. you went
totheircencertandsuwihem. Youdidn‘l
satiate yourself with an image on a Tv
screen, Now everything is pushed Ev-
eryone knows what to think. Il's right
there. In wont to be accepted in a certain
group in society. I can press n button and

Grinnell and Iowa myths

by Howard B. Horn

This is my first yearhere at Gnnncll
College. l'm front the Chicago area and
most or my friends went to big. state
universities. My friends could not com»
prehend spending four years at a college
smaller than our high school in terms of
population and in the mlddle oflowa. In
my few months here. I've learned thatthis
school and lifein Iowa in general is really
rather normal. Yel. myths aboutcrinnell
and lowastill exist. Here ntesomeofthe
more interesting ones

Myth: Grinnell College is in the
middle of a cornfield, The fact is that
orinncll is a small city with a downtown
area, Get a little bit out orthc city. and
you're in the middle of a cumﬂcld.

Myth: Nothing ever happens in
Iowa. nusyustsirnplyisnotirue. Why.
just this past Tuesday. in Orange City,
lowa (as reported by the Des Metrics
Regine/s Iowa News Service). ti con~
crete silo collapsed...at the Farmer's cc.
op...sending 40,000 bushels olcom spills
ing out and ‘creming a big mess'

Myth; Grinnell College iSilSchtlol
forhippies. Although Gnnncllpmbitbly
has one of the highest hippie per capito
ratios in thestate oflowa. Grinncll is not
as liberal as it used to he. There is tin
increasingnumberofRuplllyllCimsoncnmr
pus. which is good because the liberals or
Grinnell have hecome too complacent.

truth. Grinnellstudcnu havetoeet.sleep.
and watch Star Trek and The strapsortr.
After all. everybody needs a snidy break
once in a while.

Myth: The only thing in lows is
corn. Iowa is a top producer for pork and
pork products in addition to our thriving
Com industry.

Myth: There is nothing to do on
theweekertdsatGrinncll.There'splenty
to do here on the weekends. Why Jusl last
weekend, I counted three things to do.
Only two of them involved watching a

movie at Harris, The other involved alr
tending a party at Harris,

Myth: Grinnell is not really a col-
lege town. Why. sure it is, Cryinncll has
one par and halfa record shop. And what
college town would be complete without
a Wal Mart?

Myth: Everybody knows every-
body else on campus. I don't know
everyone on campus. lust today I met a
woman I had never met before. lt arms
out she was a perspective, but I'm sure
dtere are people on this campus that l
don'tlcnow.

Tuesday over a dozen Gnnnellians
and I went to see Mudhoney in Des
Moincs. For those of you who don't
know. Mudhoney are the godfetiiers of
grundge. They are the heart or this new
goldmind or music streaming from the
same scene in Seatle that has produced
Pearl lam, Nirvana. Alice in Chains, and
Soundgardcn. ThedifferenceisMudhney

are. No more. No less, You could

literally feel this on Tuesday. There was
no riiz. No lights, No dry ice. lust
Mudhoney.

I was so happy to be a part of that
crowd. l told lead singer Mark Arm, who
was hanging out at the bar afterwards,
“Mark. thanks forihe music," Markshook
my hand and said, “It's cool. Thanks for
coming." This wasnotMTv. ltwas not
mainstream. ltwasnotaltemativc. ltwas
cool and unique. I reached out and
Mudhoney reached back. No

Grinnell students are not strange freaks
