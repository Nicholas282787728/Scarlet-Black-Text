to have a really nice gallery they could
be proud of,“said Running.

Previous to this space, student art
was displayed in the infrequently vise

ter. When the JRC was designed, the
planners were sure to include a gallery

Strangely though, this Friday the
student art gallery will be making its

Two years ago, Ralph Russell lert
his position as Music professor after
teaching at Grinncll for 10 years. Since
then, the Musm department has lacked
a professor for a substantial field ofmu'
sic study. jazz.

“We feel that jazz is a very im-
portant area of music. Thcrcs lots of
student interest and it's a very deep
tradition here at

Galy Giddins ’70,
who taught a short course it Grinnell
last spring.

For this year, the Music depaitinent
has hired Jim Bovinette, a rcnurcd pros
rcssor at Iowa stare University, to be a
temporaryjazz director.

“I play in a symphony with Eric
McIntyre [Music] and he shot me an
email to see in would be interested in
directing,"said Bovinstrc,

The Music department is thrilled
to have Bovinette here, even as a tem-
porary diiector. “We’re very lucky that
he was willing," said Chcnctte. “Jim is
a highly regarded teacher and jazz pcrs
former."

Though hesitant to take the posi-
tion at first, Bovincrte is enjoying di—
recting at Grinnell. He has found that
lus snidenrs are responding enthusiass
tically to playing] z.

“The students I teach [at lowa
State] are mostly music majors. When
I come in to teach one oftheir classes,
they've already been sitting through

hours of music class thar day, so its
hard to get them excited about what
I'm trying to do,"said Bovinette. “Here,
1 come in once a week and they are just
so excited to be playing music."

Tommy Johnson ’09 is in the jazz
ensemble for his third year now, and
appreciates his experience with Bovi-
nette. “I love him as a director. I think
his music differs from the more com-
mercial jazz thar
we'd been playing
to the more tra~
ditional jazz that
dates back to the
'50s and ’60s," said
Johnson

But the Music
department Cons
tinues its executive
counsel-approved
search for a jazz professor. WC thought
it would be good given the vibrancy of
iazz hand, to have a professional to re
ally emphasize the impoitance of this
area ofmusic," said Chenette.

However, Johnson feels that
Grinnell should be doing more to find
a professor, and that students need to
he more involved in this process.

“Grinnell could be doing more re-
cruiting [for a jazz professor]~\vc'\tc
got all the resources available to us," he
said.

Johnson also said that he was not
aware that the Music department did
not succeed in getting a full-time jazz
professor until the first rehearsal, “The
Music department could have done a
better job letting us know the status of
the hiring process," said Johnson.

Although Bovinette likes Grinnell,
he is not looking to obtain a permanent
position. “I'm not thinking about a job
or a move," he said. "I'm reaching my
students, and I think that’s best.”

alum for whom the gallery is named.
The exhibition is in association with
the Rosenfield symposium planned to
commemorate the 40th Anniversary
of Martin Luther King, 1sz visit to
Grinltell in 1967,

Erb pointed out that it is difﬁcult to
plan student shows the first few weeks
of the semester anyway, and demand
for shows doesn't really pick up until
the end ofthe semester,“l think having
shows like this at the beginning could
be okay,”she said.

Having a student-inn gallery space
is quite an impressive feat, something
Grinnellians,especiallythe artisticones,
should be grateful for, “It's unusual for
an undergraduate artist to have a gale
lery exhibition,”
said Newman.

mercial, the purpose ofthe shows being
to gain experience and receive feedback.
Lastyear’s shows had good tuinout.Ac-
customed to feedback from their fellow
majors, the artists really desire to hear
from Stmngetsiilnd all comments are
welcome, especially the bad ones. “I’m
happy if they hate it, as long as it's feed
back," said Smith.

Currently, shows are up for two
weeks, bur the running time may be
shortened in the future,especially when
the demand for timeslots increases.
Hopes for the future go beyond sliow
length, to exhibiting different media,
including performance art, "I would
love ro see students create group ears
