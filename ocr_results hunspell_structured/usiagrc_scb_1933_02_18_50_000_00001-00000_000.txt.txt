stays in the game during the second
half, he must play a guard in the deep
end of the pool. Infringement of ths
rule may mean forfeiture of the game.

The second rule says that at least
one guard and the goal guard must
stay behind the center line during the
entire game. Disoboying this rule
gives the hall m the opposite team.
