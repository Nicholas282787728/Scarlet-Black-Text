CLUB HOUSE TO BE BUILT.

Project of tire Uncle Sam's cluo Oi'gane
ization to be Placed Under
College Authority.

The Uncle Sam's Club is for
boys. It is not for any particular
class or kind of boys. It is strrct-
ly democratic and adheres to its
object as expressed in the boys”
constitution. “mutual helpfulness
arid preparation for good citizens
ship.” The club started last year
and was in its incipiency. some-
what of an experiment. its chars
tcr li‘rembelsliip was twelve lads
From that beginning it has wits
rrcssed rapid growth and now has
a membership of ntty. The en~
tliusiasm of the lads in their club
and the evrdences of practical
good of the club work upon the
boys together with the testimony
of many who have been associats
ed with the boys in their hie out-
side the club have made it evident
that the Club has a mission. A
plan has developed for the perpet-
uation of the club in stable form.
A neat club house will be built by
subscription among those who
are interested in the work for
boys. It will givetheboysa room
large enough for a good assembly
room which will also be a reading
room and contain game table:
The building will be constructed
on a neat plan and make an at
tractive appearance It will be
built wholly from voluntary sub-
scription and it rs expected that
work will be a large part ot the
contribution as it is the plan to
hire nothing done. There will be
an effort made to secure the don-
ation of a lot for the purpose of
the club and if ground cannot be
found which the owners will do»
nate. the use of a lot will be see
'Clll’ed or a building will be located
on college property of which there
are several available lots although
not In the most desirable location
for the club.

Tire club house will be trrrned
over to the college and become
its property when it is completed
The choosing of the superiiitends
ants oi the club will be placed in
the hands of Professors Main,
Millard. and Wyclroff and their
successors.

 

The material for the building
as it rs at present planned will
co>t chcral liiiiitlrctl (lollilis tilitl
rs hopedthar there wrll be ilitcrs
cst among certarn college Circles
which will sccrrrc ior (lit: project
curtsrderable assistance ertlrcr rri
contributions of money or work,
The work has bccrralready partly
volunteered and try students
willing to be of assistance in this
movement are icquested to see
S H. Crosby in the near future.

The club directors are already
cho‘sn for the next two years.
E. F. Denrson will be rn clinige
next year and C. R. Barnard ass
ststant. The following year it is
cxpected c. R Barnard will
have charge of the work,

The club thus far has been en-
tirely self supporting and has an
income from clues of about ﬁve
dollars a month. After the club
house is built the running ex-
penses will be all borne by the
members of the club.

BASKETBALL SCHEDULE.
(Continued lrour First Prize.)

games will be played rn Grrnncll.
Last year Wcster-n College defeats
ed us by a small score while lowa
has already defeated G.ririnel| this
year rn an exhibition game betore
the opening of the season. Thrs
game is no rrrn‘rcation ot the pres-
ent strength of the Grinnell team.
Over a month's larthtul practice
has done \Vondeis in developing
both individual and team work.
The men are training as they
should. both to learn the game and
to keep in the best condition
Jack is keeping his eye on the can-
didates and that means that every
man will be able to play the game
through,

Other things insure a strong
team. though none of last year's
‘Varsity will play this year except
Capt, McKeag, Shilling, Homer
Clark. VanHoescn, Fillmore, licls
den and Wilson are strong Candis
dates for the team; which will win
honors for Grinncll. With the
coming of the new gymnasium,
basketball has taken a place in
Grinnell athletics and fully des
serves the enthusiastic support of
the Grirrnell spirit.

 

Overlooked!

It just occurs to me that I have not given enough prominence to
my PRESCRIPTION department. . This oversight must at once be curs
rectcd and i now announce that I have the best equipped Prescription

department not only in Grinnell but in all this victnity.

Pure, fresh

drugs and chemicals. and competent and experienced persons in

charge insure the best results,

We solicit your Prescription patron~

age together with the Book and Stationery business.
