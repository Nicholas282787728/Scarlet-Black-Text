in fact fired after her vacation time and an additional period of
leave ran out.

Mudslirrgiiig ﬂycrs and commercials have saturated Iowa in
advance of this Tuesday's election. Candidates Denise O'Brien
and Bill Nortlrey have also featured plenty of mud in their cams
paigns, but they have been content to lcavc it in the ground to
nurture Iowa corn. O’Brien and Northcy, running for the open
Sccrctary oi'Agriculture position, brought their civil campaigns
to the Forum South Lounge Tuesday for a two hour debate

The debate was a chance for the competitors to deﬁne their
individual stances on issues important to Iowa agriculture. as
well as to answer questions from the audience eoneernrng such
disparate topics as ethanol, sustainable agriculture and the place
oforganic farming in the state’s future.

Bill Northcy, the Republican candidate, has been opcrating
a corn and soybean (arm in Spir-rt Lake, Iowa, since 1931. He
has served as president of the National Corn Grower's Associar
tron and traveled extensively in Asia as a representative orIowa
farmers.

Noithey defended agribusiness and large family farm: at
the start of the debate before emphasizing his strong support
for ethanol. "Vl’c need to makt> sure Iowa stays at the forefront
of renewable energy," he said. He thinks the best way to make
that happen is to create new markets for ethanol, such as by
encouraging auto manufacturers to make cars that run on etllas
1101.

As secretary of Agriculture, Northey would also expand
support for farmers taking a role in the processing otrhcrr crop
as weu as growing it,"Any way producers can make more mons
ey, wt need to do," he said.

Democratic candidate Denise O’Brien has, with her lillS’
band, opcmted a farm near Atlantic, Iowa, since 1976. Since
1995, they have organically raised poultry, apples and straw-
berries. O'Brien is currently executive director of the Women,
Food and Agriculture Network She has spoken before Cons
grass and the UN. on behalf offarmers.

O’Brien called for Iowa to become “more economically vi~
able and ecologically sustainable." She wants to encourage new
farmers ofnny size, including those working small family farms
and organic farms. O'Brien said that right now it is prohibi-
tively expensive to become a new farmer. “You have to he ate
tached to the land to farm it,"she said in the debate. “You have
to marry into it or be born into it."

She also said more orowa’s produce should be sold in Iowa,
thereby keeping more of the so billion that Iowans spend on
food annually within the state’s economy. O'Brien also supports
further development oflowa’s ethanol production capabilities.

The tone of the debate was civil and measured,Afterwards,
a community member in the audience congratulated the two
for running clean campaigns. Moderator Wayne Moyer, Politi-
cal scicncc, was also complementary. ”This is the highest level
political discussion that I’ve heard this fall," he said.
