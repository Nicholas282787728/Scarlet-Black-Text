Plasticized pleasure not enough

Do you ever feel that High Street parties don’t
provide enough entertainment? Sometimes a keg fails
to frll the sanrrday night void. In which case you just
might have to pack up a bunch of your friends at 1
am and go to the Lions Den Even 1008 docsnt have
the vibratoi selection that the Adult Superstore docs.
(Alrhoug h I did learn that 1008 once housed a black
dildo called the Black Man-r
ba. It hung in the doorway
like avantrgarde nrrstletoe,)

It was high time. An
opportunity to peruse the
never-ending possibilities
of sex with plastic. Walk-
ing through the aisles of the
Lions Deli, full of rubbery vaginas and fleshlights, l
bravely reached my hand out to touch the “try me!"
mini vagina attached to the lifersize pornorﬁed vulva
and amputated thighs l have to admit it felt kind of
nicely squishy. I wouldn’t necessarily want it as my
lifelong partner, but for occasional squeezing as stress
relief, it seemed fine. I was still thinking, though, that
these toys were totally classless. Maybe even gross, It
seemed okay for people to use penis look-alikes, but
not to interact with a rubbery vagina. What makes
some of these sex toys great and others gross?

Perhaps those vagiuas too closely resembled the
real thing. When I look at an 11-inch plastic purple
dildo, it takes some imagination to relate the dildo
back to the anatomy that inspired it. The chances of
encountering an llrineh penis, never mind a purple
one, are rather small, Some of the VlbI’M’OK‘S took a hint
from a bunch of farmers and cieated the corn on the
cob vibrators. And the cucumber Vibrator. Bttt I can

tell you that we have a long Vimy to go before we en-
counter a male with a crop in place ofa cock.

When we remove the human from the anatomy
by using a toy, sexual pleasure ncquires a new done
nitiorr. It isn't about one person giving another (or
themselves) pleasure. Then: is a newbie in the midst.

 

Something that is there to aid you in your time of
need. It is exciting because no

 

one can supply you with that
kind ofpleasure,But ifthe toy

 

resembles anatomy, we lose

you are getting before you get into bed.

When I walked out of the Adult Superstoie I
was relieved. 1 did not appreciate being bombarded
with choices.I became paralyzed, questioning what I
truly wanted. Or if] wanted anything at all. Picking a
partner seemed so much easier than a sex toy because
much of the time, there aren't many options. Other
people aren't waiting to be selected, so you must acr
cept what you have. That’s not to say we are settling
when we canoodle. If you want it, you can always
recruit a sex toy for your afternoon delight. But you
can’t have a relationship with a piece of plastic.

Time to repossess Safety’s first-place gold medal

Safety first! This Wellrknown 510,

playgrounds and worksites. But not
everyone lives by this standardisuch
as Gary Testa, an early retiree in Jack
sonville, FLGaty follows the slogan
“safety thitd.” As I worked with Gary
on a Habitat for Humanity site in Jack-
sonville,I asked myself: what’s first and
second?

Gary doesn't really care. He lives a
life ofriskrtaklng and has a long string
of great accomplishments as a result,
such as putting himself through college
delivering pizza, then retiring by age
50. Since he moved to iacksonville, he
has been one of the most active mem-
bers of the Habitat chapter with the
highest per-capita homes built per year.
Not surprising with people like Gary
involVed!

On a construction site, following
a slogan such as “safety thrtd“ seems a
little dangerousiespccmlly one where
we were climbing around on the rafters
of an rrafrnrshed roof. But Gary knew
evactly what he was doing. At the end
of the day, the house had it roof and
no one got hurt. I distinctly r-emem-
ber thinking, much to my surprise and

that reprioritizingsafetyso that it is not
always frrst has a lot of merits.

This past summer when I biked
crossrcountryﬂ knocked on the doors
ofstrangers, ate all the food anyone ofe
feted to me, talked to everyone I saw
and never really thought anything of
it. I was armed with quad muscles from
biking all
day, busi-
ness cards
for my
organizer
tion and
that was it.

It was not

until the

end of my trip that I realized that this
blind and defenseless trust of people I
knew nothing about was farrly atypical
and, some may say, unsafe,

In a lonely house at the bottom of
a inouittaiit at least 10 miles fiom any
othei signs of civilization, an eldeily
widow lived by this unconventional
standard. When I bilted past |1el home,
dehydrated and exhausted, she didn't
hesitate to help me. She understood
that her house was the only one for

to anyone in need and offered her food,
water, bathroom and gasoline. Her
strength and courage still amazes me as
she accepted an unspoken deal of trer
mendous trust between two strangers.
This pattern grew to be so habitual
that I didn’t even realize how much I
had trusted strangers until Yuha City,
Calif. I are
rived for
the night,
sweaty and
duty as usllr
al, and ran
into a man
who prom-
ised to take
me to a shower. I quickly found some
friends, and we all loaded in a truck,
made amicable conversation with him
and arrived somewhere about 10 mine
at vay for our long awaited shoWr
ers lhcn it clicked. I had no idea who
this guy was. llc seemed to be a nice
guy who offered to drive me across an
unfamilrar city and that was all that had
mattered to me when I jumped into his
truck. Many things could have gone
wrong. Luckily, he was the pastor of

the church that had taken us in for the
night and therefore had a legitimate
role taking us to showers.

Undeniabiy, my summer would not
have happened or been nearly as our
joyable without breaking all the safety
rules I learned in kindergartenI might
still be in the New Mexico deseir with
only the rattlesnakes to keep me com-
pany had it not been for that old lady
who gave me energy bars and water as
my dehydrated seifapproaehed a sevenr
mile long hill.

A friend put this skewed philosm
phy in more logical terms: she painted
out that we can never be absolutely
safe, so why spend our time and energy
fighting forjust a little more protection
when there will always he holes? It is a
neverrending battle that has been lost
from the start. Call me a cynic. You
might be right; however, 1 am optimise
tie about how many other, better things
we can do with our lives when we are
not worrying about safety. In my last
column, I urged less concern about our
academic records. Instead ofconstaatly
fretting over- our classes, we should rake
more r-isks outside ofthem and keep in

mind Gary’s cheer: “Safety Third!"
