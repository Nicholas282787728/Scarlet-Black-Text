Cheering Students Hold
Torchlight Parade;
Alumni Return

 

By Frances C. Hansen

The peppiest, most enthusiastic
Homecoming celebration in the
memory of present students was
dampened not at all by rain that
started falling about midnight
Friday. The decorations, however,
were thoroughly soaked and have
dyed the roofs patriotically in
scarlet and black.

The torchlight parade last night,
pep chapel, gaudy and original
decorations, the Homecoming play,
"Kind Lady," and alumni chapel
this morning are the highlights of
a joyous three-day celebration that
will reach its peak at the football
game with Drake at 2:15 this aft-
ernoon, and at the Honor G dance
tonight.

Men Cheer

Cheering which has been going
on in the men's diningrmom all

Capt. Stevens
Predicts \
Higher Flights

Stratosphere Commander
Relates Experiences
on Last Trip

 

Declaring that facts of great
scientific value were gathered in
the last 10,000 feet of the 72,000
foot ascension he and Capt. 0r-
ville Anderson took in a gondola
last November 11, Capt. Albert.

more important facts could be
realized at an altitude of 32,000
feet, and that such a flight would
be possible with the use of hydro-
gen gas instead of helium gas,

Captain Stevens stressed the
idea that a strosphere flight is
taken mainly for its scientific
value, and should not be Considr
ered as just an attempt for one
man to go higher than somebody
else; that part, he said, is very inn
teresting for everybody, but it is
not the only aim of the ascension.

Ozone Layer

One of the facts Stevens says
they determined on this flight is
that the layer of ozone that covers
the earth, and protects it from
the ultra violet rays of the sun, is
lower than previously thought, but
thicker,

The speaker explained that cos-
mic rays come from all directions
at high altitudes except from the
earth, which intercepts those that
are coming from the other side of
the world. In 1900, he added, peo-
ple did not know that there were
cosmic rays. In the Explorer, II,
the largest sphere that man ever
constructed, there were delicate
instruments designed to try to
discover how many kinds, how
strong. and from what directions
these rays came.

The temperature of the stratoe
sphere is constant. During the

Initial Tryouts
for Student Chorus
Attract 120

Approximately 120 students
came to the first meeting of the
student choral society. The chor-
us will meet every Wednesday
evcning at the chapel at 7:30
o’clock.

F. Walter Huffman, who will
direct the chorus, wishes to im»
press the fact that the choral So~
ciety is for the student body.
“Everyone who would like to
sing, is urged to attend the re-
hearsals. It is still open to pros-
pective members. Men, in parti-
cular, are invited to come out and
sing,” Mr. Huffman said.

Later on the chorus will be
managed by a group of students

elected by the chorus. Next
month the students will begin
work on Christmas carols. They

will take up a selection from
Bach's chorsle, “Break Forth o
Beauteous Heavenly Lightw they
will also work on Di Lasso‘s
"Echo" and Gaul‘s "Carol of the
Russian Children." The purpose
of the chorus is to be a source
‘of pleasure and an opportunity
,for the students to sing.

(By Wells Barnett)

A grid rivalry dating back 40
years will be renewed this after-
noon when Crinnell will meet
Drake university in the forty—
third contest since they began in
1896. Drake, with a heavy. pow-
erful team, defeated only once
this season. is pregame favorite
by an 18 point margin, which, in
a Drake-Grinnell

   

game, means
nothing.

The Pioneers, seeking their
first victory over Coach Vee

Green's boys since 1933, aren’t
conceding the Bulldogs anything
in this game, Guy Lookabaugh,
the new Crinnell mentor, said
Friday. Crinnell, although beaten
in their last four starts, have a
fairly heavy, fairly fast team,
potentially powerful offensively,
and capable of stopping most
strong running attacks. In spite
