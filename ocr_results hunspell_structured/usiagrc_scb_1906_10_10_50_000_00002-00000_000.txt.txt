ATS on to the coeds: Seeing the
H needoitahingmattersintotheir
own hands ii anything in the way oi
systematic athletics ior the women oi
iowa College was to be accomplished,
they have at last organized an associa-
tion of their own and will at once com.
mence work. Although it is too late
to do much in the way oi outdoor bus.
ketball, tennis or gcli, yet the organi—
zation will have something to do dur-
ins: the winter, and will be in good
working order when spring comes.

The girls deserve great credit lor-
the enterprise they have shown in this
matter. The two meetings they have
already held have accomplished much
toward periecriug an organization and
a plan or work has already been made
out The enthusiasm shown iortcns
astroog association which yrin mean
much lo the women or (ilinllell.

That they need such an organization
is shown by the iact than tiie only
Iorm of systematic exercise possible
ior women was indoor basketball, cun-
lined to the winter months and limit.
ed to a comparatively small number.
The only other thing they could do
was to pull an oar on Arbor Lake or
play tennis on what very much rescin-
blesa ploughed ﬁeld. From now on
some advantages in the way or athlet-
ic exercise can be oiiered as induce—
ments to prospective students as well
as anorded to the women already in
school

There are also reasons why the men
should support this new organization
in every way possible. Three years
ago the girls iurnished money ior new
iootball courts and they have always
been enthusiasticsupporters oi all our-
athletic teams. Speak agood word
ior the girls’ association it you can do

no more. ‘ Boost with all your might.

HE suggestion formulated at the
senior class meeting last ereii-

ing to establish amodel iora senior-
pin to be used by each succeiling class
is as ioilcws. Some design representa-
tive and suggestive oi lowa College is
to be chosen by the present classes or
the college. 'J‘h senior class or each
year. beginning iiitli '07. will adopt
this design as its emblem
numerals thereupon and using it as a
class pin The change in numerals
irom year to year will distinguish the

dillerelit classes yet the unity ol guru“

student. it will take the cooperation

the success oi the plan. but ii each

cornea permanent one and continue
as the regular senior ciiiblein.

The value or the idealies iii the that
that with ollourclnss and Wilma pins

, ‘ we lack one single design which is rec
Oglii/cd niiirersany as the emblem of‘

ion-a College. The inaltese cross, the
regularcnnege seal and the banner are
all signiﬁcant oi Grinnen. yet. each
has its peculiar associations and does
not mean Llle Slime to ‘every one.
Furthermore rt is hard to thinir or
ones class entirely apart from the col-
lege asa whole. An emblem which in
days to come would suggest both the
class which meant so much to each oi
us and the college which we all lore so
well would be a valuable treasure and
would represent as a unity Grinnell
and everything connected with her.

It has also been suggested that this
is a tit subject ior our student council
to consider. Whoever the representa-
tives oi the classes who discuss the
matter we hope a-iarorable decision
may be reached.

plant is permeated by copious air
canals to laciiitate respiration in the
parts under water. The round leaves
attached to the leai stltlli at the cen—
tre, are also well calculated to resist
the iorces which tend to submerge
them The seeds are disseminated
by noating organs, by which they sail
far away train the parent plant. Since
many kinds or Water Lilies hare
sprungirom a common parent since
Eocene times. it is interesting to cons
sider the lives along which they
have dirergede. g. color or nower,
time or nowering, etc. These facts
indicate the ireedom oi the organism
in its response to the innuences of its
