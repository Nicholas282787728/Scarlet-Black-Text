We as- Grinneilimofoen tend to brag about
how socially just and liberally rninded we are ,
However, sometimes ‘ social consciousness
seems'to disappear on the. weekends. This Friday,
according to my Faceboolr news feed, the party
“Sex Workers and their Bosses” will be taking
place on campus The event page sells the party
as a ﬁm “way to break gender stereotypes." As
one of the main coordinators of Mary Bl James
last year, I’m a huge supporter of having fun and
breaking gender stereotypes, but this isn’t the way
to do it. No matter how you spin‘it, abuse, vio-
lance imd rape are all major components of rho sex
work and sex trafﬁcking industries 1 undeistmd

' butI still believe Grinnellicms should uphold their

progressive values on the weekends too.
