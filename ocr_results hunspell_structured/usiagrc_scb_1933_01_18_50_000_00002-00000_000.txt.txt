INEQUALITY AND ALLOWV
ANCE

Having completed the three-day
reading period and now entering
into the examination week. many
students are declaring themselves
better prepared than ever for
what the professor has ill store
for them. Apparently lliltil new,
the reading period has been a
success but two elements lie ahead
that may spell defeat. Success or
failure 110W remains entirely at
the professor’s discretion.

Students have concentrated
most of their effort on study in
their major field as was recolnr
mended by creators of the plan.
Naturally these majors are differ-
ent. Collsequenll, a psychology
major will for on rank in the cx-v
alnindtion fellow members of the
class who 'are majoring in other
courses.

Nearly all pupils have utilized
the reading period to good ad-
vantage but ill the above cited
pr suiiiptiou we find inequality
0 ts. If all professors do not
recognize this fact and make al-
lowance [or it. students will
rightfully become disgmntled
with the plan alld the lllreesd-dy
reading period will fail.

IMPROVED DINING SERVICE

Most of the men in the dorlnia
torios have at one time or other
this year eaten ill the Quadrangle
dining room, and have frequently
remarked about the difference in
the atmosphere that pervades
there.

It is too bad that the men of
the halls, both the waiters and
those who are waited upon, can-
not follow more closely the ex-
ample set at the Quadrangle. For
one thing, there is not so much
hustle and bustle to get through
at melllrtlme, and consequently
the service is more efficient, so
that in the long run meals do not
take any longer.

Those in charge at the quad-
rangle are to be complimented on
the efficient handling of a crew
that is larger than the one at the
dorms. In fairness to all eolleerlr
ed, it might be said that women,
although more particular, are not
as hard to wait on as men.

Other Opinions I

EDUCATION’S JOB
(The Vancouver Sun)

Those 1on school teachers who are
spending their hard-earned money in
weekly advertisements directed to the
public on education’s job are to he
commended.

It is a particularly happy sign that

. the teaching profession has so Splend‘
idly realized its responsibility in the
matter of keeping the public abreast
of the times. ,

If the people listen with one car
to the Utopian plans of the radicals
and with the other to the reaction—
ism of conservatives, they are left. in
confusion of mind that may blossom
into revolution.

It is the task of the professor, the
teacher and the educator generally
to so refine the public jurgnient that
neither that confusion nor that revo—
lution will occur.

The politician is out for poli cal
power and pclf; the money Inanlpur
later is out for profits; the “reds" are
out for impossible reforms Each one
is out for himself.

It is up, then. to the educator to
give up the right lead. That is his
job.

The teaching and educating body
is Lhe intelligentsia of any communir
tyitho final intellectual backbone of
any people.

Tile exploiters of capitalism collect
their millions and look down smugly
on the masses. The radicals sit down
and figure out how they are going to
persuade the masses to join them in
raising hell.

Neither of Lllese will pull the world
out of its present hole, That essential
task can only be accomplisliediond
always has b'cen accompllsllediby
the great middle classes, led and 'ms
structed by sound and conscicntious
educators.

The world today is full of obsolete
leaders who cannot adjust. themselves
to the new situation. Their outwoin
economy and ideas make them look
like old savages meandering around
in a new civilization of Lechnocracy.
' l‘lle fact that automatic machines
for purposes of production have dis—
placed and made obsolete one—half
of mankind does not occur to these
old savages. They do not realize that
not only will those unemployed not gu
hack to work, but that machines will
further displace manpower.

They think that we are in the mid-
die of a little storm that will blow it»
self out.

But those unemployed are still a
one hundred per cent consuming fac-
tor. And to keep them as consumers,
drastic adjustments will have to be

' made in society.

i Campus Opinion

Do you think that oumiilers should
be allowed to "crush” llolmepurﬁes
after intcrmrsaionf

James Putnam: No. If a cottage or
hall pays for a party, it is entitled to
enjoy the dance in privacy.

Robert Snarely: 1 think that as
long as everyone has a house party
at some time or other it is better if
those who do not have one on a
night that some others do, to not
crash it, because if everyone crashed
parties, they would soon become so
crowded that the novelty and special
charm of a private party would not
exist.

Arlovene liugler: From the prin—
ciple of the thing—No! If it is not
carried to excess—Why not?

Victor Fini: People are naturally
curious to see and compare the (life
ferent house parties and because of
this I see no reason why they should
not be allowed to give a house party
the once over and even dance one or
two numbers, but after intermission
I believe all outsiders should be ex»
cluded.

Mal-y Heil: Someone crashes your
party.,You crash someone else-s. Why
shouldn’t. everyone enjoy a “taste" of
every party?

Betty Alllyrig'l-lt: Why not give
everyone a chance to dance at least

’Jays Defeat
Pioneers, 27-25

Hiank Duncan High Scorer
With 14 Points

Stavmg off a desperate last-minute
ru‘sh by the Grinnell Pioneers, Crciglir
ton's Bluejays redeemed themselves
Saturday night somewhaL for their
startling defeat at the hands of Drake
the night before, Coach Schabluger‘s
men finished on the long end of a
‘27-25 score, but only after a tough
battle from the opening whistle.
Biucjnys Improved
Creighton played a much~improved
game over their showing of the night
before, and led by the accurate-shoot—
‘ing of Collin, outscored the Pioneers.
iGTinnell drew away to an carly lead
and was ahead at one time, 11 to 4.
This margin wilted when Collin be-
gan barragiug the hoop from far out
on the floor, and the score at half-
time was tied at man, ‘
i In the liist half, Captain Duncan
‘cai d Lhc fight alone, as far as
scoring is concerned. He swishcd the
net five times with one-handed shots
and scored all but one of the Pioneer
points in the second half.

,l Creighton lcd 27 to 22 with three
minutes to go, hilt Ulli-ich counted
on a free toss, and Duncan made a
‘neat shot from the side to bring the
,Grinncll team within one basket.
‘With two seconds to play, snnti was
awarded c free throw, which he in-
tentionally missed, but in the ensue
ing scramble, the ball was lost as the
gun sounded.
i The Bluejays missed is free throws
out of 23 attempts, which in itself
is almost a record. Last year against
Drake, Grinnell missed 19.
