Men’s track, Will Freeman compete at Drake;
Women at conference meet

by Jeff Raymond

While most Grinnellians were preparing
(or the Grinnell Relays last week, the
men's track team was in Des Memes com-
peting in the Drake Relays. Unfortunately,
the runners who made tlle trip did not do
well enough to quality tor the final heats
and had to be content to “Compete" in the
Grinnell Relays

The Pioneers had entries in the 4x400,
4x200 and 4x100 meter and sprint medley
races. There were problems in the ex-
changes of the baton in the races and in-
juries also hampered performances The
Pioneers also had to be content with very
tough competition at the college level and
were not up to the task or staying with the
others. The Gn'nnell competitors \vere
Charles Briggs, Harry Bullerdiek, Bob
Curley, Jett Hersh, Vern Juel, Pat U'Reil»
ly, Doug Wright and Jon Maron,

Among the standouts in the relays lield
were Herschel Walker and Mel Lattany.
While it would have been easy for the Grins
nell runners to be overawed by the people
in the field at Drake, Coach Will Freeman
insisted that injuries and poor execution
hurt the Pioneers more. Freeman said that
overall, “I wasn't real pleased with our
performances." ’

Freeman himself had an exciting time at
the Relays He competed in the decathlon
earlier in the week and turned in an en-
couragingly high score. Aiter tinishmg a

close third after the lirst day's events and
later gaining over 1,000 points in the pole
vault, Freeman held a sizable lead going
into the final event, the 4.000 meter run,
Untortunately, competing in nine events in
two days took its toll on the undercondi-
tioned Freeman and he ran the 4,000 in an
unusually slow six minutes. He linishcd in
sixth place overall and was iustiiiably
satistied with his perrormance

“l was extremely pleased with myseit
considering my training," Freeman said
He had been “playing around with the
decathlon" and decided to try out his skills
at Drake to see it he had potential in the
event, He was encouraged by his perfor
mance, which came atter only about six
months oi training. and says now that it is
mostly a matter or getting into shape
betore he can register better perlor-
mances.

The women's track team iinished tourth
in a field oi six teams at the recent cons
terence meet. injuries again played a part
in the disappointing tinish. The women's
team iinished the indoor season
undeteated and were competing imr
pressively on the outdoor track but several
people who ran indoors dropped rrom the
squad beiore the outdoor season began.
Other teams, meanwhile, gained com-
petitors and were able to pick up points in
more events Noteworthy periormances at
