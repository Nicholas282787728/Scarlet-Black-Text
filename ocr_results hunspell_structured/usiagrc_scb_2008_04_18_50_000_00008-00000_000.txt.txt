After long search, Grinnell to welcome new jazz prof

BY PETER HENRY

Last spring, esteemed jazz critic and alum
Gary Giddins ’70 declared that what Grinnell,
the home of Herbie Hancock ’60 and a llum’
ber of historic concerts, needed was not just a
anz professor, but a whole jazz department.

On the whole, students agreed that it ms
about time for inorcjazz at GrinnellTlie mun
sic department agreed, too.

“The department had decided we wanted
a full’llmc jazz faculty member at least a year
before Gary Giddins came." said Eric Mclnr
tyre, Music, who led the candidate search.

After a lengthy search Grinnell will add
a fullrtime jazz professor next year. Damani
Phillips, an alto saxophonist from Detroit, will
take up the tenure-track position of leading
the newly expanded Jazz Band and reaching
classes within the Music department, includ
ing a SOOrlevcl Jazz Composis
tion classt

“I’ve always wanted to
reach from the very beginning,
since my first day of under-
grad," said Phillips.

“the playing was just ebule
lient," said Eugene Caub,
Music. “He just exudes posi-
tive energy.” Gaub described
a candidate lecture he gave
in the fall, in which Phillips
pulled out his saxophone to illustrate hop and
swing solos on the spot.

Grinnell Will continue offering classical
saxophone lessons through a staff instructor,
but Phillips hopes to teach private lessons as
well. Though he does not yet know if he will
teach them through the college, he assures SJX’
ophonists that he would make himself avail-
able to teach no miittei what.

He stresses that he will be satisfying one of
the most important requirements as a teacher
outside of the classroom. “In Detroit, it’s all
about you getting in there and mixing up with
your students," he said, confirming that he
would regularly sit in on Jazz Night in Bob's.

Students are looking forward to working
with Philips outside the classroom. “1 think
it'd be great it be integrated himself into the
budding jazz community," jazz vocalist Alex
Conlon '09 said,

He won't just be benefiting students, but
also the professors on campus who have a
background in jazz. “Ifhe needs a horn player,
I'll be there," said McIntyre, who used to play
Jazz. Erik Simpson, English professor and
tenor saxophonist, also expressed an interest in
playing with Phillips should he come to cam-

pus.

”/ think it’s great that the
muil‘t department /5 tak—
my step: toward; more
different types ofmuS/t.”

since the student Jazz Band has grown
into a fullrtimc ensemble, thcrc will be plenty
more room for Phillips to help his students
grow. “With the extra time we can start doing
extra styles besides swing," said Phillips, who
also expects the band to perform at least more
than once per semester.

“I’m hoping that, perhaps on on informal
basis, we can add a combo, at least one," Phile
lips said “That's probably more applicable to
what’s happening outside of Grinnell in the
music world,"

Phillips also hopes to bring more profcst
sional Jazz concerts to campus in the following
years. “Informally, l’ve already discussed that
with the faculty," he said. “That’s something
I think is critical, it's one thing to talk about
it in the classroom, it’s a completely different
thing to have somebody of a serious eiiliber
come in and give a serious pere
formance.“

He began his musical ear
reer is a classical saxophonist,
and earned his Master ofMu-
sic at the University of Ken-
tucky in 1999. After working
1|! a music store for a while,
Phillips decided that “there
were not many opportunities
in classical" saxophone and
decided to switch over in Jazz,
He went back to school for a second Master's
degree, this time inJazz Studies, from Wayne
State University,

Phillips is finishing up a Doctor of MUSI’
cal Arts in Jazz Studies at the University of
Colorado. The jazz Studies Doctorate, which
attracted the attention of Grinnell’s candidate
search, is relatively new, with only about six
universities offering the program. By Pbillips’
estimations he will be the first AfricanrAmerr
icon to earn the degree.

Pbilips‘s extensive experience as a per-
former spans cuies and styles across America.
He has covered his hometown Detroit. Dons
ver and has toured for years at a time, He has
played with Marcus Belgrave and Ira Sullivan,
toured for two years with a Dave Matthews
cover band called “Crush," and has recorded
with George Clinton. He plans on performing
throughout the Midwest, including anywhere
he can in the town ofGtinnell.

Hearing Damani Phillips isjust as impore
tant as hearing about him and where he plans
to take jazz at Grinnell. The samples on his
