PRESIDENT DAN F. BRADLEY

MRS. BRADLEY

 

BACCALAUREATE SERMON.

Sunday at 10:30 as ﬁne an audi-
ence as the Stone church ever held,
assembled to hear President Bradley
deliver his ﬁrst baccalaureate Sermon.
The clouds of Saturday had cleared
away and the weather was ideal, an
auspicious omen for the class about
to enter a broader life. The music

was led by a choir of nearly seventy
voices and with the exception of a

solo by Mr. ’Condit assisted by the
choir, consisted of familiar hymns.
Reverend Adams, the only living
member of the original board of
trustees, was present to give the inv0v
cation and the benediction.

President Bradley’s discourse con-
sisted of a picture of the life of man-
kind and an application of the de-
scription to the class. For the Scrip-
ture lesson he read in Genesis the
story of the fall of man in the garden
of Eden, and in Revelations the vis-
ions of the New Jerusalem which
John had on the Isle of Patmos. The
two books, Genesis and Revelations,
deal with man‘s profoundest thought
about his origin and destiny. They
compass the transit from simplicity
to understanding, from ignorance to
knowledge Genesis treats of the be
ginning of man’s life and experience.
From a life of ease in the Garden, en-
tirely dependent on God, man was
cast suddenly forth, like a young bird
from its nest, to battle with the forces
of nature for his existence. From
the relations of man and woman the
family and other institutions of so-
ciety were evolved. The life of man-
kind has been a period of growth and
development. The Bible story is
typical of the world. The Greek
and Latin classics also show that the
race has been at school with God as
its teacher. [t has been travelling
the road of development.

The class also has been travelling
the same road. The college has
brought it thus far on its way; thus

 

far it has come successfully; but the
graduates can have no guarantee of
further success in life except as they
owe it to their own efforts. In the
world each must build for himself;
though this is true it is also true that
the qualities which have won success
in college life will have their inﬂuence
in the life of the world. The world
is a good one and will endure much
from us without complaint. it will
be to us what we are to it, returning
to us what we measure out to others.

The discourse closed with an ex«
hortation to the members of the class
to cultivate a feeling of sympathy for
the life around them. During col-
lege life they are surrounded by con-
ditions that influence toward noble
living and the formation of high
ideals. The masses of people in the
world have not had these advantages
and the college man should sympar
thize with their failings rather than
despise them. The charge is made
that college training produces cyni-
cism and contempt for the interests
of life. Only by cultivating a broad
spirit of sympathy can this be refut-
ed. '

VESPER SERVICE.

From several standpoints the service
Sunday afternoon was the best held
this year. The attendance was larger
than has appeared at any function
thus far.

Rev. A. L. Frisbie, pastor emeritus
of the Plymouth Congregational
church of Des Moines, gave the address.
He said that faith is essential to hu7
man life. A unity of faith is neces-
sary to till rip the human idiocyncrasies,
and, as a person cannot live by him-
self, a certain sympathy which reaches
out is essential to human existence.
The student in the college community
has the opportunity to develop this

sympathy to the highest degree and it
is the duty 01 everyone to endeavor to
develop this ﬁner nature as far as pos-
sible.

 

THE CLASS DAY EXERctSEs.

This year for the ﬁrst time at Iowa
College one whole day of the corn
mcncement was set apart for the grad
uating class. The day selected was
Tuesday, and the exercises were divid-
ed into three parts. The ﬁrst was the

CLASS PROGRAM.

This was held in the Congregational
church at nine o’clock in the morning.
The church and rostrum were beauti—
fully decorated in the college colors
and the scarlet and white of 1902.
H. G. Lyman, president of the class,
presided over the exercises. After an
organ prelude by Prof. Matlack ‘and
prayer by Prof. Parker, the class orar
tion was given by John. W Gannaway.
He spoke on “The Development of
Governmental ideals.” He contrast-
ed the ancient ideal of the individual
bound up in the state, apart from
which there could be no ethical life,
and the modern conceptions that gov-
ernment is antagonistic to the individ-
ual welfare and its functions should be
minimized as much as possible. He
then showed the weakness of both
conceptions, and that the ultimate
ideal toward which the world is mov-
ing is the community of interests of
the people and the state, the will of
the former being the decree of the
latter.

A vocal solo by Miss Bousquet folr
lowed, and then Miss Goldsworthy
read the class history. She ﬁrst drew
a picture of the ﬁrst year prep. who
entered Grinnell in 1895 ; then follow-
ed the story ot the life of the class, its
athletic victories and defeats, its social
bums, its scraps with other classes,
and ﬁnally, in contrast with the ﬁrst
picture, the graduate of 1902 was
shown. .

The mantle oratorwas Miss Spencer.
At the close of her oration she gave

the mantle, and with it the honor and
traditions of the college, into the care
of the Junior class, represented by
Miss Nelle Kennedy.

 

The program closed with a song by
a double quartet composed of Messrs.
Gannaway, Harris, Nollen and Evans,
and Misses Millard, lugalls, Olds and
Borrsquet.

EXERCISES ON THE CAMPUS.

These were something entirely new
in the commencement of the college,
yet they formed one of the most pleasV
ing parts of the entire week, At two
o’clock the Senior boys and girls in
single ﬁle left the Chapel and the he
brary respectively and met at the
stone of the class of t880, whence
they proceeded two by two to the
platform erected on the south part of
the campus for this part of the exere
cises. Chairs had been provided for
the class and for ladies and children,
and the others stood or sat under the
trees.

The class song was sung and then
President Lyman called on Miss
Louise Williams to give the address
to the Freshmen. She spoke in a
clear voice and was easily heard by
the large audience. Her talk was
full of quiet humor and sarcasm as
she extolled the merits of 1902, or
pointed out the past mistakes of 1905
and the way to attain greatness in the
future.

Next the presents to the seniors
were given. This took the form of a
mock commencement day. Mr. L
L. Harris announced the candidates
for the various degrees, such as Ph.
B. (phenomenal being), A. B. (ath—
letic brag), B. A. (bachelor of agricul-
ture), and D. D. (Dr. of domestic-
ity). As the name of each, was
called be mounted the platform and
was given by Miss Douglass a present
appropriate to his chief hobby. These
were so apropos as to call forth roars
of laughter from the audience.

Audience and class their adjourned
to the place prepared for the ivy
planting at the southeast corner of
Blair hall. The address here was
