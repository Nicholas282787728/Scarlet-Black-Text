Grinncll, Wednesday, May [5. rgoi,
@biioxiul

(Brita importance or the High
School Meet to be held
llerenext Friday should not be
underestimated. The tact that
the Athletic Union has assumed
all iesporlsibilily tor the meet,
makes it an event which should
receive the united support of the
college. Itshonld be remember»
ed that the holding ol the meet
in this way is largely an experir
merit. the result or which may
decide whether Grinnell Shall
have the meet as a permanent
thing. It will also be remember»
ed that these high school athletes
will be the athletes of the colleges
in the near future, and the im-
pression they gain oi Grinnell and
Iowa College, may be the deter-
mining tactors in their choice ot a
college. College students, for the
most part, are interested in alli-
letic events, no matter by whom
they are held, but for obvious

reasons this particular meet
should appeal to us with extra-
ordinary lorce. For these reasons
the management and students
should exert every effort to make
our guests enjoy their visit,

One Dollar to Oskaloosd.

On Friday night the l7lll,tllecler
batebetweenthe Lewis andAlllens
societies will be held at Oskaloosa.
Much hard work has been put on
this debate and it promises to be
a most interesting contest. The
Lewis Literary Societywillberepr
resented by Messrs. Dunn, Hansen
and Paul, three of the strongest
men in the society. This is the
last and only chance tor victory
this year, and it is hoped that the
students will uphold our men in
every possible way. A tarc at one
dollar has been secured for at least
25 persons. The committee on
rates have not yetbeen able to see

care that number and any who can .

possibly go should hand their
names to the committee.

High School Athletes Here

Frlday.

Plans for the state high school
meet are rapidly materializing.
Most of the Vlsiting teams are ex
pected to arrive Thursday even.
ing. Des Moines will be on hand
Friday morning with a large dele-
gation and everything points to a
good attendance.

It is still doubtful whether the
track on Wald Field will be in
suitable condition for the track
events. In case it is not in condrl
tion, it will or course be necessary
to hold the meet at the Fair
Grounds. Fitty cents admission
will be charged to both prelimin-
aries and ﬁnals or to ﬁnals only.

 

 

The admission to the prelimin-
aries only is twentyrﬁvc cents.

Practically all of our visitors will
be in town Friday evening and
must be entertained. A geneial
reception will beheld ill the men's
gymnasium at 8 o’clock. This will
be tollowed by a banquet to the
contestants at the New Monroe,
provided their number is not so
great as to render this project im-
possible.

Ful-thel- announcements will be
made on hand-bills and bulletin
boards tomorrow
