and indeﬁnite.
It should be the aim at every seeker
after learning to use iacts in an intel-
ligent manner. This is the basis oi
all success.

Education is a. great humanizer. A
young man of college age at Bloom—
ingtou, Indiana. confessed Monday to
murdering his father in order to get
his money. It a dormitory man has
gone to that length in Grilmell it has
not yet been brought to light.

Money is cons cred ditiercntly by
different people. It is all a matter
01‘ the point or view. If you owe it
you forgot it; it others owe you the
iact is ever present in your mind. Stu-
dents who llztvc outstanding bills with
local merchants will forget them by
the law or averages. The merchant
won’t.

A good many years ago a. man by
the name or Abraham started out as
the head or a tuniily.‘ It wasn't long
until his descendants became so nume
erous that one tribe wasn't enough
for them. They did the obvious thing
and split up into twelve.

Gl'umell started out as a single colr
lege family. Formally years the mem—
bers wcr‘c bound together by common
interests. There was no need tor a
smaller group as the individual found
his life centered in the college.

Grinneil has been steadily growing,
Remarkable strides have been made in
recent years. The enrollment has
steadily increased and a larger incre-
ment than ever before is promised for
next year. student interests are be»
coming more and more diversined.

This development has hrot with it a
demand for group fellowship which
cannot be denied. Those who have
been in a position to observe student
lite here know that it exists already
in very deﬁnite form.

A wise direction and encouragement
of this growing tendency should be
observed by those interested in the
we are of the college. It is a matter

oughttnl consideration of
‘ . insulin.

n liners college professor should
realize his insigniﬁcance when he stops
to think that while he is failing to

. hold the attention of one small class
a streaked..parrot across the street
can grip the undivided interest or
about twenty classes at once. We
wonder when the feathered Ph.D. will
so abroad to study.

_into the bay at Lisbon, Portugal, can

Adventurers. It is mentioned as the
place from which Vasco da Gama made
his famous trip of discovery around
the Cape of Good Hope to India. Co-
lumbus anchored in its mouth upon
his return troiu his second trip to the
Americas. Now we see the Tagus river
mentioned in press reports as the spot
at which the N074 ﬁrst landed in Eu-
rope alter completing the ﬁrst aerial
voyage across the Atlantic. Old Fa-
ther ’Tagus should wear a flower in
his button hole in celebration at the
arrival of Capt. Read. his youngest
son.

“All Appeal W the Future."

Just as we rejoice in the constant
realization oi the beneﬁts. benignly
bestowed upon by uul‘ Alma Mater, so,
too. are we piqued by the inadequate
means uttered to achieve social pres-
tig%d companion or academic pres—
tigei Frequent communications hav-
ing promulgated the existing discon»
tent with the present social lite of
Grinnell, but have offered no solution.
If a problem exists. there must be
something at fault If there is to be
a. solution offered, [here should be a
lucid understanding or its need.and
purpose. i
Attention to the social life in Grins
hell need not be’ indicative of the ful—
lowing: “Society is frivolous and
shreds its day into scraps, its conver-
satio into ceremonies and escapes."
Nor would it need to imitate the tra-
ditional university type. Rather. in
Grinnell. it should aspire to he Grin—
nellian — magnanjmous, distinctive.
original and democratic. Is it imprac-
ticaitto desire that the present social
life be replaced, the adverse traits of
tbi‘: University type be dissuaded, and
A social life created, which embodies
the highest attributes of character—

THE BERRY MAD GAPS.

On Monday and Tuesday nights of
next week, June 9th and 10th, the CD—
lonial theater will have an attraction
or unusual merit. as the Merry Mad-
caps will play there the two nights.
with"a change of program the second
night.

Reﬁnementis the keynote at the squ
cess oi this organization. who give a
reﬁned and pleasing entertainment in
conjunction with a ﬁne picture pro-
gram.

The Charles City papers spoke very
highly oi the company saying among
other things the following:

Flo Hartley's Merry Madcaps which
is being ieatnrcd on the present hill
iis a girl act of unusual merit. iuii oI
lsiugcr and pop, and well worth sce-
ius by anyone intcrcsted in vaudeville

From the rise to the fall oi the cul—
tain the audience is entertained, by
a bunch ol clever performers, headed
lby Miss Hartley. who no doubt has
been a Pl'imzt Donna with some opera
company, as she possesses a brilliant
Isoprano voice of exceptional merit
and has a most pleasing personality.

The dance numbers at the girls
were well liked. and the two comedi-
ans ore of the old school who know
how to pass runny jokes over the foot»
‘lizhtsi
Tho skating novelty was much an-
iprccizttcd. and a funny song by the rat
Iman was well put over.
