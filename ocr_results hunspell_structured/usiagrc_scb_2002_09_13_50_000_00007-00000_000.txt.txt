a struggling sends/English tearher, and her
band of pretentious, gay artist friends.

Almost immediately, love lines begin to

English readier after he sees her in a play.
Her drug dealer, the bartender near the [her

after sleeping with the ehautieur. At the

That all sounds eomplieated, but with
the tight and wittyseript it all eomu affix:
nothing more then a few typiod days in
