[PC To Resolve
Grading Issue

The AllACollege Educational Policy
Committee will be iocnsing during
the second semester on the develop-
ment oi a iinal grading system, the
insiitution oi a black studies major,
and possible calendar changes at
Grinnell.

After an exhausting semesterrlong
debate on the seven grading proper
5315 presented during the first see
mester, it is likely that the Com-
mittee will soon reach a decision.
According to rec Secretary Shelley
Floyd, the debates became increas»
ingly Irustrated during the latter
stages of the semester, and during
the last meeting the Committee ap-
proved a suggestion to decide on the
matter during the first weeks of
this semester,

The Committee voted last Novem-
ber lo not to consider any grading
systems which would permit stu-
dents to take all their work onanon—
graded basis, although on October
2i the members indicated a willing-
ness to consider such a proposal ior
only the junior and senior years.

The proposal of most immediate
concern now is that made last se—
mester by Mr, Parslow, which lea-
tures an A»B-C-erase system with
elimination of the credit‘failoption.
Under such a system the grades oi
Dand F earned in any course would
not appear on the student’s trans
script. in a straw vote taken on
December 9, the Committee mem-
bers voted 6-1 in favor of the idea.

According to Ms. Floyd, the Com-
mittee will also consider expansion
of the practica programs at the
college, such the possibility oi
more studenti tiated ofi~campus
study. The Committee will also be
debating proposals ior calendar
changes, such as going to a 4+4
system or the three~term plan in
use at some colleges. Shelley hopes
to get together an ad-hoc group of
students to look into the calendar
matter since ”the Committee works
so slowly.”

AAAS Henrs Study

Three Grinnell students who parti-
cipated in the summer Rock Creek
Lake project presented an abstract
at their report to the annual con-
ierenco oi the American Association
for the Advancement oi Science on
December 28.

Tony Wheeler, project chairman,
Anne Walter and Mike O’Connor for
ported that Rock Creek is in fairly
good health but will require carciul
attention over the long range to keep
it that way. On the basis oi biologi-
cal and chemical analyses of the
lake the report, which runs to 326
pages in its written form, concludes
that the lake is "perfectly safe for
all kinds of water-based recrea-
tion." Erosion and decomposing
algae are listed as problems which
need careiul attention, however.

Anthropological and economic stu-
dies were also conducted by the 16-
member investigation team con-
cerning water management pro-
grams and users’ attitudes towards
the lake and its maintenance. The
project was conducted under a grant
from the National Science Founda-
tion.
