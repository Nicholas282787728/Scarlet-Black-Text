HAIL T0 TEE FEESHMAN, THE
TRUE INDIVIDUALIST.

Are the students of Grinnell indi—
vidualistsl Do they think for them-
selves and then act according to their
reflections?

The reason that freshmen classes
are so interesting is not because they
are so “green." but because they form'
the most individual group in college.
They come from schools and towns
that are different from each other,
have not the stamp that college puts
on a person, so it is only natural that
they should present a delightful coir
trast to the rest of the college.

They bring. in themselves, not only
a green hue, but give the picture of
college life a
ground. It seems that
making certain promising

instead of

prominent in the foreground of uppel .

classmen years. there is a tendency to
let use picture fade.

CHAPEL MEMORIES

"comfortable but not beautiful." and

sacrcdness, and sacredness is closely
connected with beauty. so had assum—

was beautiful.

There was a certain degree of co

chapel services this week. On Mons
day morning, Frof. ancll opened the
series by speaking on the topic, “Camel

said. were utterly ruiucd because em
phasis was placed upon detail rather I
than upon the central ideal Like

discussed was that of it bust of Moses

mond Fosdlck. who is going to visit
the Grinnell campus in a few weeks,
as another man whnse life was con ,
trolled by a code of well balanced
ideals.

Wednesday

President Main spoke Wednesday
morning on the "Practical Man and
the idealist." relating his talk to both‘
oi the preceding speeches. "The
commonplace thing," he declared, “is
to extol the man of affairs and to rid-
icule the man of ideals. As a matter
of fact, it is the lde‘alist who has been
the tore-runner of all progress."

“Young man and young woman you
are in college and every minute of
your life you ought to be thanking
Cor said Fred E, Smith, chairman of
the National Movement ior Law Erie

long chapel last Thursday morning.

Mr Smith urged his student and
once to st. l - collcgc but he con-
tinued, "There are some or you who
will fail at cve thing you undertake.” ‘
He made this clearer by stating that
he did not mean the slew student but.
"the swagger fellow wliosc morals are
slowly breaking down."

Considerable time was spent by
Smith in a direct appeal to the men in
which he sai , “From one end cl thc‘
world to the other. there is a cry ior‘
mon oi superb morality." He went'
ahead by stating that business is cry-I
