The Glee Club will meet for a
short rehearsal on Tuesday after-
noon, at 1:30 o’clock, in Prof.
Cole's oﬁﬁce.

It seems advisable to the Stu-
dent Council that the whole
question of the Honor System be
brought before the student body.
Therefore in about two weeks the
constitution, as amended, will be
submitted to a mass meeting of
the college sludmlr, for rejection
or approval. Please to note that
this mass meeting is tor college
students only, the Honor System
having been already withdrawn
from the Academy by Amends
ment 1. Look for further notices.

The Mlnstrel Show.

The Athletic Uuion Amateur
Minstrels gave their long-looked
for performance last night, which
was an unqualiﬁed success, both
ﬁnancially and as an entertain-
ment. The house was packed

with an appreciative audience, and
netted the Union a neat sum which
was much needed. The orchestra,
under the direction of Mr. E. B.

Brande, and the chorus were
particularly ﬁne. The solo work
and impersonation song also re-
quire special mention. The local
hits were all good, and the audi-
ence wished for more. The ﬁrst
one on the Opera house, was per-
haps the best taken, but the one
that took the best with the audi-
ence was the “Hymn to Apollo.”
The High Kicking by Mr. Leach,
and the Buck and Wing Dances by
Messrs. Fuller and Holly were the
best exhibitions of the kind we
have seen in the city. The cake
walk was well produced, and being
something new in Grinnell, was
much enjoyed. The program
was as follows:

PART FIRST.

I, Grand Ensemble: The Witmark
Overture and Opening Chorus, by entire
Circle and Orchestra.

2. End Song: Why Don't you get a
Lady of Your Own? Mr. Wheeler.

Dear College

Fullcr

Exhibition,

Grlnnell Institute.

Notwithstanding preparations
for the minstrel show and for the
Greek play, seventeen members
were in attendance at Wednesday
evening's meeting. Pres. Denni-
son called the society to order
and Norris was appointed critic.

The ﬁrst number was a talk on
the Chinese Empire. by Lay-
bourne. The characteristics due
to race, topography and political
conditions were given in a manner
which showed quite a Comprehen-
sion of the subject.

The remainder of the program
was almost wholly extemporane-
ous work, owing to one absentee
on the literary program and three
on the debate. Burlcw was Called
on by the chair to discuss the Sa-
moan Trouble; Roberts, Expan.
sion and American ideals; El-
dridge, Sir Charles Beresiord and
his Mission. Burlew’s talk was
the best extempore speech made
in the society for some time.

Campbell and Lindsay were ap-
pointed by the chair to take the
place of the two regular afﬁrma.
tive debaters. Davis was appoint-
ed to the place of the negative
speaker absent. Blackburn, the
other negative debatcr, was the
only regular man on the debate.
The question was: Resolved, that
Woman Suffrage is desirable. The
discussion indulged in resulted in
a considerable number of keen
drives of a personal signiﬁcance.
Lindsay gave the most logical and
best arranged argument ot the
evening. Laybourne volunteered

 

 

for the negative. Swan, who acts
ed as judge of the debate, decided
in favor oi the aﬁimative.

The critic's report by Norris,
was rather brief in the nature of
the case, and had more to do with
the members absent than those
present. In the business meeting
the roll of the society was in-
creased by the installation of Zeigr
ler.

Ellis.

The meeting of the Ellis Society
was held on Thursday afternoon.
instead ofat the regular hour, ow-
ing to the Dual Meet, which was
expected to have been held on
Friday. The program was opened
with the roll call, to which the
members responded by an original
rhyme. Miss Jessie Harriman
favored the society With a piano
solo, and kiildly responded to an
encore.

The subject for the afternoon
meeting was the artist. Leonardo
Da Vinci. Miss Annie Shiley
gave a well written paper on his
life. giving the most striking and
interesting features of it. He was
born in the beautiful city of Florr
cnce, where he spent much‘ of his
life, in the early palt of the ﬁfv
teenlh century, and he lived al~
most long enough to see its close.
in early life be displayed a great
interest in natme study, and even
early showed remarkable talent
for drawmg and painting. His
life might be said to be one char-
acterized by simplicity and noble-
ness.

Miss Lulu Williams presented
some of the best known paintings
of Da Vinci, among them his pict-
ture of “The Last Supper," also
one of “Mona Lisa,“ and “John
the Baptist." l—lis pictures con-
tain a beauty which fascinates
rather than delights. a beauty ot a
particular type, such as of the
hands, hair, and often of ﬂowers
and landscapes. Above all a hu<
man personality centers all his
paintingsmakinglhem character
istic‘dlly beautiful.

McClure's Magazine for April,
was caretully reviewed by Miss
Elizabeth Pomeruy. Miss Swa-
ney gave an impromptu speech on

"Club Gossip,” and Miss Finer
spoke on “College Annuals," atter
which Miss Lila Stag closed the
program tvrth a piano solo.
