COLLEGE DRIED 0R ‘V L BRED?

University graduates take great
pleasure in discussing the assertion
that the college bred man can be rec
ognized in any environment and in any
activity. when college men are ques-
tioned regarding the scorecard upon
which they base their differentiation

the reply is a superﬁcial recital OIL

vague generalities concluding with the
precise statement that the college man
can be told by his manner.

Considering that a man's manner in-
cludes not only the ability to keep the
little ﬁnger daintily arched while lift—
ing a teaspoon at a. formal dinner but
also his attitude' toward his fellows we
sometimes doubt the advisab ty of
spending four years of a life-time and
an extravagant outlay of money to
receive the Simon pure label of the col-

A GOOD HOST.

From The Harvard Crimson.

Football has always been a. gentle-

man’s game, probably because its Yen

‘physical nature brings out the best iii
men. Last Saturday the crowds an i
plauded Boynton not only because his

playing was spectacular, but because
it was also the clean playing of a
gentleman. Coach Moran of Centre
College boasts that Harvard will never
have faced a. “cleaner playing team.’

That is the real football spirit; that
is why the game is scarcely tainted
with professionalism and the rowdy

ism that goes with it. This fall there
have been crowds in the stadium who
ii are so ignorant as to believe that
the gentleman’s code applied only to
the players. Prolonged “lions” have
greeted official descisions; cheers
have been heard when a team was
penalized. It was evident that these

The best host is one who creates an
atmosphere in which all his guests
will want to join. is there airy reason
why the Hai-tard side of the stadium
should show a silent indifference to
its opponents, a sort of cold supci»

for the host in the stadium has done
little to create an atmosphere which
will make those who “boo" feel decid-

to act like fine sportsmen; why not
expect as much from the Harvard sup-
porters, instead of passive indiffel'»
