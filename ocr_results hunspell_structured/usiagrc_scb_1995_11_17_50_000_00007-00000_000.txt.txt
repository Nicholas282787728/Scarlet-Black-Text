Newt Gingrich on capitol Hill

As part orthe Washington Center program, Mann had
an opportunity to meet a few imporiant political leaders,
including Paul simon and Carol Mosley/Biotin

But not all of Mann's iiiteiactions with politicians were
supportive. “I had achance io hear Newt Gingrich speak .. it
was scary because there “ere only about six AfricaneAlnerlcans
in the whole audience. He said that [minority students] are
taking positions from oiiaiiiied white students. I was really
uncomfortableil don’t think people expected me as an African-
Amcrican to be there.”

When asked whether it upset him to hear Gingrich attack
minority students, Mann demonstrated a mature attitude. ”It
wouldn't do any good for me to get angry. It was more important for
me to know his position on different issues."

Mann thought that it was important to hear the other perspec-
[ives on such issues, He pointed out that although Gingrich‘s argu—
ments sounded logical, a closer analysis proved otherwise. Many
students receive special privileges. ”lfyou‘re rich, you have privrleges
because your folks Will support the school,” commented Mann.

Community Service

The political interactions were interesting for Mann, who has done
much more grass—roots community service work. Over the summer. as his
community service proiect, Mann worked in a youth shelter tor teens who
can't live at home anymore. The teens lived in a shelter that taught them
independent liVlng skills

Mann’s role in the house was to talk to the students about the importance
of going to college. Mann talked to the students about such issues as rob
hunting, communication, personal development. how to control anger, and
how to believe in yourself, Although Marin has had much experience working with shelters,
the experience was still uncomfortable at times.

parents, Also, their sense of reality was a lot ditrererit than mine," said Mann. oiie otthe
students he worked with pointed out that he couldn’t possibly know what it was like for them.

He agrees, hut believes that role modeling still helps. “I explained io them rhat college
isn't impossible. it's just a normal routine. It's not a place where you need to be on the ball
all the time or be supersmart. I also stressed how important it is to go toschool,”said Mann.

Grinnell Activities and the Pathﬁnder Series

In the same way that Mann wanted to show students at the shelter that other people who
faced obstacles could make it. he also founded a program here for students to learn about

Mann, is based on the idea that “people come from different paths in life. We come to
Grinnell to find a path to follow. We bring a speaker in. either a professor here or someone
outside ofGrinnell to talk with students. It’s usually a person ofcolor because it’s the BCC
Pathfinder lecture series. The purpose is for students to see prominent people of color who
have achieved different things. That’s helping to dispelstereotypes but also broaden people‘s
minds."

Mann noted that it has been encouraging to listen to protessors speak, to get to know
them better, and to identify with their struggle. “You also cansee that you can make it too

“1n Grinnell, the only thing you need to do is have a vision," said Mann. “This school has
