A Way To Continuity

The decision to hold the Student Council presidential
election and the C of HP election a month early is to be
highly commended. The important student offices are gen-
erally held by Senior students. Seniors are busy in the
spring, often too busy to do justice to their jobs, much less

to train their successors. . ‘
And yet a training period for the Incumbent officers

is of the utmost necessity. The new officer is frequently
too busy getting accustomed to the mechanics and routine
of his job to give sufficient time to either carry»through

or innovation
If new officers were selected in Februray, they would

have a thorough understanding of the demands of their
jobs and of the projects pursued the year preceding the
year of their tenure. They would, in the fall, in full author-
ity, be able to carry through the projects and yet be able
to give time to the presentation and integration of new
ideas. There would be present at Grinnell that essential
quality of continuity without which no institution or idea
can survive, any more than either can survive without
change. .

The lack of continuity at Grinnell is serious. In the
past year three ideas have been presented and have met.
With enthusiastic reaction: 1. Student Government, 2. Lake
Acre, 3. Thanksgiving vacation.

Work for the realization of these ideas continues at
the organizational level, but at the individual level interest
and enthusiasm wane after a few Weeks. Is this the fly by
night enthusiasm of crowd psychology? No Wonder com-
plaints are regarded as teapot tempests and demands as
passing fancies.

We doubt that there has ever
been an institution estuo rod
which some people did nol want
to change. Undoubtedly this ac-
counls for much progress. Here
at Grinnell there is much the!
we would change.

This is evident from the come
plaints that we hear about the
food, the cut rule, car rule,
drinking rule, women's hours,
and so forth. These complaints
may have a legitimate basis, h-il
these expressions of dissatisfac-
tion have become quite boring.

It seems to us that what-
ever action can be taken hos
been and is being taken to
satisfy our complaints. Through
the proper channels, student
organizations, faculty and (HI-
ministrativc groups have ink.
.en every practical step toward
achieving this.

We cannot believe that our
"rights“ have been ignored or
that any of these groups have
deliberately thwarted our efa
forts for reform.

Complaints continue, how.
ever, and will continue. It
often seem that what‘s lack.
ing is something more import
ant to talk about. Since in
seem to find so little material
in our oourscs that is worthy
of sound discussion, perhaps
we should triple the number
of outside activities so we’ll
have something “important" to
comment on.

Don't misunderstand us; com-
plaints are probably Just as
much a part of Grinnell as the
Wednesday chapel hour. We
should hear in mind, however,
that the qualities which are
Grinnell are not determined as
much by administrative policy.
faculty recommendations, or de-
decisions of the student council,
as they are determined by the
sum of the Individual attitudes
and interests of the students.

If we wish to change Grinnell
we must change ourselves. This
is the path toward real progress.

December IO, I954

To the Students of Grinnell College:

The editor of the Scarlet and Black has asked me to
make a statement with respect to the procedures and pro-
gress in the matter of the presidency of the college. The
trustees recognize the interest of the students in the subject
and are glad to make this statement. The Board first under
took to put into words an outline of the qualities which it
hoped to find in a future president of Grinnell. In this they
solicited the views of the elected representatives of the fac-
ulty. The resulting specifications placed first, of course, the
need for a leader in the field of liberal arts education, a man
who can help make the pursuit of knowledge an exciting ad
venture. Education is our reason for being, and it is funda
mental that the president provide experienced and thought
ful guidance toward the continued growth of the college i
that field. Administrative experience is second in import
nnce because the presidency is essentially an administrative
function. This calls primarily for an ability to help peopl
work effectively together. We hope for a man who has .
sympathetic understanding of the problems of students, fac
ulty and members of the college operating staff, and wh-
can Weld the many elements of campus life into harmonious-
ly functioning whole.

The problems of financial and business managemen
are important responsibilities, as are those of student ac
tivities, organizations conduct. Many of these are carried
out through the offices of the deans and through the co
operation of the elected student groups, without which th
college could not function effectively.

Thinking students recognize the many and varied mat
ters which are the responsibility of the president. To find
a man who excells in all of these fields would be a rea
accomplishment.

‘ The desirability of an early conclusion to the scare
ls recognized by the board members. The process of inter
viewmg the many people whose names have been suggste:
is a time consuming but interesting task. The importanc-
of thoroughness is also apparent to all. At the board meet
lng held on the campus December 4th the committee re
viewed the progress made to date and asked for additional
time for the completion of the job. Students and facult
nembcrs may be sure that when a conclusion is reached
every effort will be made to asSure that an announcemen
mll be made on the campus before it is released to the
oublic press.
