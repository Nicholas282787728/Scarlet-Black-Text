Caldicott urges end to nuclear weapons race

By Todd Perry

“The nuclear weapons dileme
ma, like many other greztdebates
in American history. will
ultimately be resolved by the Peon
ple," were me words that Bishop
Maurice Dingman of the Diocese
of South-West Iowa used to in
troduce Dr. Helen Caldicott,
President of Physicians For
Social Responsibility and founder
of Woman's Action for Nuclear
Disarmament.

Several of us in the Nuclear
Arms and Weapons Control class
went to hear Dr. Caldicott argue
for a nuclear weapons freeze in St,
Ambrose Cathedral in Des Moines
last Friday night. Senator George
McGovern also made an ap-
pearance. keeping the numerous
press crews busy.

As a physician, Dr, Caldicott is
welleversed on the extent of
nuclear war’s effects on human
beings. Her detailed dacriptions
of these effects, although quite
graphic, drove home her point
that nuclear war is an unthinkable
option.

Caldicott admits that she is not

an expert on nuclear war and
weapons, indeed, some of her
statemenm on the environmental
eitects and explosive power of
nuclear weapons were highly
debatable But again, in citing
these effects, she underlined her
speech's basic premise: nuclear
war is suicidal in every way, and
something must be done in the
short-term to freeze and reduce
the number of nuclear weapons
which the two super-powers
possess.

Australiansborn Caldicott
revealed that she first felt deeply
concerned about nuclear war
after reading Nevil Shute’s On
The Beach as a child. As the
speech progressed, she convinced
me that her belief in her educa-
tional crusade was sincere. In
fact, she gave up her work as a
doctor to devote all of her efform
toward attaining a nuclear freeze.

Caldicott's historical knowledge
of the nature of the East-West
polemic was profound if not
enlightened. She sees the Russian
leadership as “...nld, frightened
and paranoid.” She stated only
half-jokingly that “They are
paranoid for a reason. They are
the only nation surrounded by
hostile or potentially hostile com-
munist nations!" She added that
four nations (China. France,
Great Britain and the United
States) could individually destroy
the Soviet Union, and that the fact
that the Soviets lack any true

‘ methods

allies also increases their fear,

As a physician, she said that one
does not frighten a clinically
paranoid patient for fear that they
might strike back, Thus she con
cluded that threatening the Ruse
sians at this time is “stupid,”

In this context, she pointed out
that placing the Pershing missiles
in Europe is extremely dangerous
saying that by putting our
missiles where they can reach
Soviet targets in six minutes, we
endanger the relative parity of
US. Soviet nuclear weapon
strength. This balance, she
argued, has enabled the two na-
tions to reach mutually accep-
table arms agreements in the
past. Thus if we continue to deploy
the Pershing 115 and other
destablizing weapons, we limit the
possibilities for arms control.

Caldicott showed that contrary
to popular belief, post-Stalin
Soviet policy has responded deiens
sively to American threats.
Despite the Soviets’ weaknesses,
she said that we do not have to
trust them to obtain a verifiable
arms control agreement. Our
satellites and warhead counting
assure mutual
verifiahility of any arms control
agreement.

Yet. Caldicott emphasized that
the arms race must be stopped in
the near future because the
technological level of the weapons
has advanced to such a point that
the number and nature of
weapons will soon no longer be
verifiable, Today, in fact,
destabilizing Cruise missiles can
be hidden anywhere and can be
deployed almost immediately.

Caldicott sees President
Reagan and his potential reelece
tion as dangerous influences on
the arms race. She believes that
American nuclear arms limita'
tion proposals have been
unreasonable both in their content
and in the way they have been
presented to the Soviet leader-
ship. Thus, she charges, these pro
posals have been designed to tail.
She added that Reagan is about to
violate many arms agreements.

Caldicott is wary of the patriotic
fervor which Reagan has'pro-
mated since the 1980 elections. She
sea a connection between Hie
peak of this fervor and a war:'
fighting mindframe which she
calls ”pre-nuclear thinking.” She
cited Civil Defense plans to
distribute shovels in the event of a
nuclear war, and the Defense
Department’s five year guidance
plan to “win" a nuclear war in a
six month period as evidence of
pro-nuclear thinking in the pre
sent administration. She also
mentioned that over half of our
scientists and 75 percent of the
Space Shuttle’s missions are
employed by the military. These
figures, as well as the defense ex-
penditures of over 2.3 trillion
dollars over the next three years
are re-resentative of this overn-

ment's
priorities.
Caldicott pointed out that
“America led the arms race. and
thus set up her own suicide." She
therefore believes that America
must oust Reagan to develop a

distorted military

. cautious and Sane nuclear arms

policy. in reference to this year's
presidential elections, Caldicott
claimed. “The next eight and a
half months are going to decide
the history of this planet because
soon our world will be
”technologically out ot human
control,"

Caldicott points out that after
World War 11, Americans “got
hooked on technology for lack of
any other way to maintain ab-
solute world dominance.” At that
point, corporations saw the
economic profit to be gained from
this new technology. and rival
military organizations Saw the
necessity of acquiring this
technology to maintain their
relative strengths. Caldicott's
soon to be published book entitled
missile Envy discusses the “Iron
Triangle” between corporations,
Congress and the Pentagon. The
book fathoms how this group has

determined nuclear weapons'

development and policy decisions
since the mid 1950's.

At one point during her speech,
Caldicott asked for a showing of
hands for all of those who believed
that we live in a democracy. Only
a few people raised their hands.
She responded to this response by
stressing the importance of in
dividual responsibility. She said
that “We have abrogated respon-
sibility for our political decisions
to corporations and governmental
organizations,” and that “We
must take back this responsibility
if we are to save our world from a
nuclear holocost,"

Caldicott said that both our
trust in public officials to handle
our problems and our fear of
nuclear war has lead us to a high
level of apathy, or “Psychic num»
bing,” which prevents us from
taking a genuine interest in our

precarious and [earrinspiring
situation. She added that this
psychic numbing ls suicidal. and
that we must get angry at the II"
responsibility of the decision
makers Whom we have allowed to
determine policy, thus channells
ing this anger constructively.

At the end of her speech,
Caldicott reiterated her hope that
future politicians would work
towards a nuclear freeze. Then.
while gesturing towards George
McGovern, She said that there

was a statesman in the crowd who
might be able to tell us more about
this possibility.

McGovern took the floor and,
after adamantly concurring with
Caldicott’s fears and hopes. said
that he thought that under the
”right" administration, it might
take two to four years to ratify a
mutually verifiable freeze. He
then recounted a small anecdote
which I thought was indicative of
his awareness of the
precariousness of our present
situation. He said that he had
recently seen the text of an argu-
ment between President
Eisenhower and a member of the
then»incumbent Secretary of
Defense over whether the US
should have zoo or 400 nuclear

bombs. Eisenhower, in tavor of
the lower number, purportedly
said: “Why don't wejust go crazy
and build 10,000 bombs?" Currents
ly, the individual stockpiles of the
United States and the Soviet
Union number in the tens of
thousands.

McGovern wasn’t the only
presidential hopeful to score
points at Caldicott’s speech.
Cranston supporters distributed
leaﬂets as well.

Not all of those present were
sympathetic with Caldicott‘s
cause. As we entered the
Cathedral, we were courteously
handed a John Birch Society
photocopy which contained such
intellectually sound statements as
“It the anti-nuclear fanaticism ot
the likes oi Helen Caldicott trium-
phs, America will be ripe for
nuclear blackmail.” On this
same handout, the “Birchers”. in
an attempt to defame Caldicott in
the minds of the more religious
members of the crowd. stated
that:

a. Caldicott recently received
the Humanist ot the Year Award
from the American Humanist
Association.

bl Humanists reject God and
“their goals are parallel of those
Communists everywhere,” and
thus,

c. Caldicott is a dangerous “pro-
pagandist."

Fortunately. Caldicott’s ability
to unite religious people behind
her cause was much stronger than
those who call on “Truly
religious” individuals to abstain
from Caldicottian hedonism.
Caldicott used quotes from the
scriptures in her speech to sup»
port her position. She also at-
tributed many of the positive
steps taken in the freeze move-
ment, such as the Bishops Letter
which declares that nuclear
weapons are morally indefensible
by religious organizations.

In reference to her belief that
“Every day we live on borrowed
time” and to her assertion mat ,
unless we change quickly,
“Nuclear War is a mathematical
certainty,” Caldicott said that
”We live by the Grace of God and
it is a miricle that we wake up
every morning."

Helen Caldicott's Des Moines
lecture provided convincing
evidence that her success as a
spokesperson for nuclear sanity is
due, in essence, to her ability to
unite a broad-based coalition
around her profound moral objecs
tions to the nuclear arms race.
