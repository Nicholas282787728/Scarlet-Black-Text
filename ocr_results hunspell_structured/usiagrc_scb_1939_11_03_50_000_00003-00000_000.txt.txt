Tuesday’s Smoke

Screens Ree/z
Of Sabotage

Tuesday morning. Smoke blanket-
ed the campus. Students and fac-
ulty, under the impression thata
war had broken out and that the
local smoke»screen unit of the
national guard, if any, had gone
into action. dropped their true
attitude of neutrality that had
been maintained with so much
difficulty through the recent
siege of propaganda. Some even
went so far as to wish they had
brought their gas masks.

Smoke drifted into the rooms.
making dry lectures even drier
and red eyes (after a hard night)
even redder. Profs coughed, stile
dents sneezed, and a unanimous
resolution was adopted. pl'ohibe
iting the mass burning of leaves.

A. tang in the air. as of bans
tires, is okay on a small scalei
but when it gets so bad that se-
niors walk past ARH because
they can't see it, things have
gone too far-I A quick poll of pub
lic sentiment revealed the opinion
that if the campus crew is really
burning with enthusiasm, it
should turn on the heat in the
vicinity of the oldest gym west
of the Mississippi.

the subject for discussion at a
meeting of the Forensic club

concerning the subjects of the
