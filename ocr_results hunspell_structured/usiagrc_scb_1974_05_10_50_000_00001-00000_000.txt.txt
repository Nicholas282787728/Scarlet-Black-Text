‘ Walker Proposes Ending
Student EValuafion,s

by Kyle Schaull

Waldo Walker, Executive Vice Pre—
sident and Dean of the College, iss~
ued a statement May 8 that calls
for the discontinuation of the course
evaluation system “as an element
of the process leading to personnel
decisions.”

instead of utilizing the student ev-

aluations, Walker proposes that an
Executive Council team interview
various students, current and grade
uated, to obtain data on a profess.
or’s teaching performance every
third and sixth year of the faculty
member’s career.The results would
he “ the only formal evaluation data
from students that would he consi—
dered in making personnel deci—
sions."

Del rimental to Morale

In 'making his recommendation,
Walker stated that “several prob”
lems have developed as a result
of the plethora of evaluation syS<
tem that Currently‘exisl in the
College. Perhaps the foremost of
these is the detrimental effect of
the numerous evaluations upon the
morale of the faculty‘."

Four Types

He listed four different types of
evaluations which faculty members
can possibly be administered during
the course of the year. Tho first
was the standard student evaluation
which ranks a faculty member to
the College faculty as a whole.

The second is the more direct and
“refined" faculty evaluation con-
ducted by‘student education policy
committecs (SEPC) which inter—
views students about faculty mem~
bers under consideration for per.
sonnel decisions.

Bup FLows

A third student evaluation is the
SSA-conducted lnstitu ionalized Gr-
apevine, which is not involved in the
College‘s de ion—making process.

The fourth system is any depart-
mcntal questionnaire or interview
run on various instructors for self
development.

Negative Aspects

Walker stated that the evaluations
are “no longer a neutral informa—
tion collection service," and that
the results have ”begun to change
the structure of classroom pedago—
gy" and course work, which have not
necessarily improved teaching eff.
cctiveness.

He added that the extensive 529::
evaluations place an unnecessary
”burden” on students’ time which
has detracted from school work.

LIGHT CASUALTIES

Wavlfer also pointed out that stu-
dents feel alienated when the final
personnel decision goes against the
recommendation of the Students,
which occurs since students are not
included in the final decision-making
Process.
Benefits
Four positive results are antici—
pated by Walker if his proposal
is adopted. First, he feels that
faculty tensions would he reduced
if the number of official evaluations
were lowered. Second, more direct
ent input could be made at the
ative of Exeuctive Council,
where the final personnel decisi-
ons are made. Third, the "bur-

dcil?’ on students time would be-

lightened, and last, the inclusion
of recent graduates would provide
a longer range perspective.

Tug-of-Wur Iniures 3

by Chris Sodoma

A few students suffered more than
the average participant’s sunburn
and loaded bscr bclly when the dye
ion rope in the tug—of.ivar come
est snapped apart in the last e~
vent of the second annual Grinnell
Relays.

Three people required hospitali—
zation, two of whom were released
after receiving treatment at the
Grinnell Memorial Hospital. The
third person was admitted for more
extensive care for the injuries re,
ceived from the accident.

1 oving

Eight others were treated by the ,
Health Center, mostlyfcrropcburns
and abrasions. Shirley Mathes, a
health center employee, stated Mon—
day that all of the people who were

treated are improving.

According to witnesses, the rope
brbke in the middle of the south
campus line—up almost immediately
after the campus tugging contest
began, causing the ropeto slash in
,two directions at oncé. The more
seriously injured were at the head
of the south campus tei‘im where
the rope flew back in the opposite
direction from which they were pu»
lling.

New Rope

Jim Douglas, Grinnell Relays co—
ordinator, estimated that over 100
People were stacked up at each end
of the 203 ft. nylon rope, which was
half.inch in diameter. Dale Hawn,
dircctor cf the physical plant, said
that the rope was brand—new, but was
not geared to withstand the stress
which the 250 people had placed on
it

Douglas commented that attempts
were made to obtain the hemp rope
used in the tug-oi—war event last
year, but that lack of communica—
tion between the correct people
could not produce the desired rope
in time. Haw-n stated that a mis—

understanding llad also occurred’

concerning the amount of people“
who would be participating in the
contest.
Future Ulie

Both Hawn and Douglas empha.
sized that any future use for ropes
would be carefully checked out in
ad». and that the accident was
extremely unfortunate. ‘

A Statement
CBS Discontinues Prosecution

We, the Concerned Black Students, do still continue lo believe
and persist in our allegations leveled against J. Richard
Woodworth and Anne Rose Abler, but due to many uufweseen
and unfortunate circumstances, we feel it advisable that we
discontinue active prosecution.

Contrary to some people's popular belief, CBS did submit
evidence supporting our allegations la a committee composed of
Alan Jones, Ronald Kurtz, Cecil Lylle and Joseph Wall. We
believed that through this special committee, set up by the
President of the College, our charges would be heard and treated
fairly. Mr. Wall's committee was thwarted by interference from
outside the College Unfortunately, Ms. Abler and Mr.
Woodworth chose to bring the AAUP [American Association of
University Professor] into the investigating sessions. For this
reason, and this reason alone, Mr. Wall disbanded his
committee. We'were greatly saddened by the decision to disband
this committee because we wished to believe that the Grt'mtell
administration was capable of deallug'uﬂth its own problems
without the aid of outsiders to the campus community. We felt
that the Wall committee was a step in the right direction.

CBS now feels that it is in the best interest of those concern/9d,. .
including the college itself, to reluctantly dispense with any
further investigations at the present time. The Wall committee
was the ideal type ofcammt'itee to settle the grievances speedily
and without the conﬂicts that the alternative unfold. We hope
that the eslablt'shemevtl of a committee such as the Wall
committee will not be overlooked in the event that other
gn'cvtmces are brought to the administration. However, the
circumstances that lead to the ullegutlovs made by CBS and the
resulting insufﬂeieul redress of grievances by the College are
not easily cast aside as futile. As long as the ”pTﬂpeT channels”
remain. obsolete and ill-suited to the needs of the campus
community, CBS is limited to two alternatives: proceed lhrbugh'
the proper channels with inherent injustices which dispel the
myth of it ‘fair and equal" hearing or, reluctantly discontinue
further efforts for proper redress of gn'evauces since it is highly
unlikely that a proper hearing is at all pussible here at Grt'nnell.
