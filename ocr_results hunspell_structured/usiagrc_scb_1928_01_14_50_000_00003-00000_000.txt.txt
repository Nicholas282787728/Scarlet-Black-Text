Year Dance?"

Fay liehder no idea tor a
change . It’s [1 r to (lie boys. ND!
only Should the girls pay [or the ev-
suing, but they Sllmlltl go ilflel' the
boys also.

Margaret Lt}!!ll(‘)‘—Fiue idea [01' It
change. It’s fair to the boys. Not
only should the girls pay for the. av»
ening, but they Should} go ilfter the
hoys also.

Ruth S Good idea. The
worst drawback is the cost to the
girls. I think tililt'll .lle bud.

Lorinda Shrub—We hope the boys
have as much [tin as we (lo.

Mill llullisc Bllllil—Turn the tables
entirely. Let the girls do everything
the boys do regularly. They should
even take till) buys home.

Blanche Hillseitus—it's a chance
for the girls [0 Show the men how it
date should be engineered.

Em Adams—It will give some of
the girls a chance. I hope there is a
stag line of girls.

Bonnie RictLThe girls ought to
wait unil 7:15 Saturday night to call
up tor their dateijust to be diiierent.

Julia JellsﬁliIt's all right hot :1
little hard on the girl's allowance.

Dorothy “'estl‘nllilt's a good thing
for the girls to have their choice once
in a while.

George Wilsollil think it's a good
idea. it permits variation in the
schedule} That’s not my personal
opinion—it’s the general sentiment.

Eddie Brown—I like it because it
makes girls realize that they have
some responsibility in life. And then
again, I don’t like it hecause I'll pro-
hably have to go to a show that night.

Ross Erahn—In cognizance ot the
fact that in such statements as these
one is liable to incriminate oneseli I
hestitate to articulate. As my old
triend'lalackstone would say. “Every-
thing you say will be used as evidence
'against you." This puts it in the ca-
tegory oi Laesis Eocrmis. Noll Com—
pos Mentl, qua vadls and Aqua. Velva.
Yes, I sure like leap year danccsl

George (Indium—You'd be surprised.

Ford Stewart—Why-oh. The more
the merrier. I'm all ior 'm. From an
econrnic point oi View they’re a finan-
cial saving."

Roll/art LEIIMTI’IIpiI like the idea.

Elton Follettﬂl think it's a good
thing the Rec committee has taken
advantage of one year in four to give
the women a chance to speak for
themselves.

Hilliard PeckiIt will give me a
night to go to the movies.

Boil AlliIt’s crude beyond descrip-
tion. it's a waste of time, money and
etiort on the part or the fairer sex.
