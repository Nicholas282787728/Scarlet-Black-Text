inopportune penalties and poor execus
tion plagued Grinnell's offense during the
Pioneers’ second game of the season last
Saturday, when Grinnell suilcreda 7-0 loss
to Concordia of St, Paul, Minnesota

“It was a tough, emotional game. We
Just could not get the ball into the end
zone,” Coach John Martinek said. Coach
Martinek attributed the poor protection of
the quarterback to a young and inex-
perienced line which was intimidated
many times by Concordla's strong
defense,

ln the rirst quarter Concordia threaten-
ed on their iirst possession. driving to
Grinnell's 39 yard line. On fourth down
Concordra's Thom Hardin attempted a 57
yard field goal It fell wide to the left.

Concordia in their next control threaten-
ed again to score, reaching Grinnell's 15
yard line On fourth down Gl'innell's
defense forced a fumble, which was
recovered by defensrve guard Eric
Hansen.

On their subsequent possession, Grinnell
failed to get a first down and was forced to
punt. Scott Stauffer's punt was apparently
fumbled by Concordia and recovered by
Grinnell, but in a questionable call by the
referee Concordia gained possession on
Grinnell's 20 yard line

Concordia capitalized on their advans
tage and scored a touchdown with 13.09
left in the second quarter, Running back
James Brown on the fourth down ran the
ball in from Grinnell’s one yard line mak-

deiense held strong and its offense sparkle
ed briefly. They reached Concordia's 29
yard line with a 1:30 left in the quarter

in the second hall, Grinnell's running
game linally came alive, but the Pioneers
failed to capitalize on long drives in both
the third and fourth quarters.

in the third quarter, Grinnell engineered
a drive headed by the rushing oi Pat
O’Reilly, who gathered 44 yards and three
first downs, Hanseter was consistent dur-
ing Grinnell's push toward the goal line.
Excellent offenswe guarding was carried
out by lan McLean and Chris Knoepfle,

On iourth down at Concordia’s 7 yard
line Coach Martinek left himseli open to
criticism by electing to go for the
touchdown rather than a held goal Grin
ncll chose to fake a held goal, instead ol
having the reliable Kevin Murphy kick one
in A critical error by the special team led
to an incomplete pass. When asked what
went wrong with the rake, Martinek said,
"There was a breakdown in the special
team," but would not name specitic
players,

The third quarter ended with Grinnell in
possession oi the ball aiter an interception
by Tom Marraci.

1n the rourth quarter Grinnell’s hard hit
ting defense stopped Concordia cold, iorcr

A Critical fumble by Concordia's
quarterback Bryan Osladil was recovered .
by Pioneer Mark Martin on Concordia's 24
yard line. However, Grinnell again failed
to take advantage of an opportunity to
score. llanseter's 17 yard pass to Staulfer
achieved a first down and brought Grinnell
to the Concordia 6 yard line, In the next
play Steve Smith carried the pass and was
pushed back one yard. Unfortunately,
Hanseter fumbled and Concul'dia's Kevin
Pattain recovered the ball on his own 16
yard line.

Grinnell regained possession of the ball
with 1:02 remaining in the game, but could
not mount a scoring threat. Hanseter
threw tour incomplete passes, and Grin-
nell relinquished the ball to the Comets.

The buzzer went off as Hanseter was
sacked for the eighth and linal time. capp-
ing on a frustrating day for the Pioneers.

Despite Grinnell’s loss there were some
bright spots. The defense, led by Charles
Blomquist and Craig Taylor, held Concorr
dia to seven ﬁrst downs and a mere 169
total yards

Although the offense amassed only 126
total yards, running back O'Reilly average
ed 57 yards per carry, Wide receiver
Steve Worth led the offense with three
receptions for a total of 46 yards,

Coach Martinek, Whose team had been
beaten the week before by the Universm
or Chicago, said alter the game that he is
optimistic about this Saturday: confronta~
tion against Concordia of Milwaukee.
Grinnell has quite a formidable task ahead
since Concordia is ranked 20th in the
NAIA,

field, the Pioneers battled the Universit)
of Wisconsin at PlatteVille to a scoreless
draw in a Zrovertime Contest Sept. 17.

“We played well in the worst weather
conditions I've seen during my years at
coaching soccer." Pfitscll stated. "We
should have won, but missed two penalty
kicks and had two goals called back
because of offsides.”

Both penalty kicks, one in the ﬁrst half
and the other one in the initial overtime
session, were wide.

Pfitsch cited the Pioneers for keeping
Platteville bottled up in its defensive ter-

ritory most of th‘ ‘ day.
