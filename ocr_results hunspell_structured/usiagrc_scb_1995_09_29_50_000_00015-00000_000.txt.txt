Last weekend there was a Ker—

Latin music, and dance competition
was held. “The people that came had
a really good time,” said Long.

The Latin Harris Party was a big
surprise for the group. Turnout was
much larger and more enthusiastic
than expected. Many students at—
tempted authentic Latin dances.
About four Latin songs were played
for every conventional dance song.

Long credits the success to the dance
being well<publicized and fun at the
beginning.
