Because of the desperate female
shortage at Grinnell college, the
men of Pine Tree decided at their
Monday night housemeeting to
have a stag party Saturday eve—
ning.

The party will not begin until
late and will not end until early.
The only requisites for admission
are a cigar, a hat, and “hard
time" clothes. The stag party
is to be a carefree, relaxation, and
“bull-session” affair, and card
playing, singing, and eating wrll
provide most of the entertaine
ment. Walter Schnerr, assistant
professor of modern languages,
will be the special guest,

able. When Dr. Everton returns
he will take over the religion
courses and Dr. Klausncr Will,
head the department of philoso—‘
phy.

A native of Wisconsin, Dr.
Klausiier received his A, B. de-
gree in philosophy at Lawrence
college at Appleton. AS an un-
dergraduate he was affiliated
with Sigma Phi Epsilon, a mem~
her of the glee club for four
years, and played on the teilnisl
team which won the Wisconsin'
state doubles tournament. He-
was awarded Phi Beta Kappa,
Blue Key, a national men’s hon-
orary fraternity, and Mace, a
local men’s honorary fraternity.

At Colgate-Rochester Divinity
School in Rochester, New York,
Dr. lflaiisner received his B. D.
degree. it was at c. R, D. S. that
he and Dr. Everton became
friends, and most important of
all it was here that he met Mrs
Klausner, who had just graduat.
ed from Syracuse university and
was working in the Colgate li-
brary. “I used to spend a great
deal of time in the library," said,
Dr, Klausner. “At first I justl
took out hooks and then I start.l
cd taking out the librarian."

When Dr. Klausncr left the
Colgate-Rochester Divinity School,
he took with him a Yale fellowel
ship. At Yale he was awarded
his Ph. D. degree. Further work
in philosophy was done at the
university of Chicago. He is a
member of the American Philo-
sophical association.

In 1936, Dr. Klausiier went to
Redlands, California, to teach
philosophy and psychology at the
university of Redlands and re-
mained on the faculty there for
eight years.

Dr. and Mrs. Klausner are
both very pleased wltih‘Grillnella
the school as a whole, the facul-
ty, and the students. Three-year
old David likes it fine, too, as is
obvious by his remark of H .
see all the pretty girls. , while
having dinner in the women’s
quadrangle.

Warns Against Federal
Control of Educalion;
Federal Funds Needed

The problem of obtaining needed
federal aid to education while
avoiding unwanted federal control
was central in a speech by Ru.
pert Hawk, superintendent of city
schools, to the combined oellege
and town League of Women Vot-
ers in the drawing room Mane
day.

in outlining needs for admin-
istrative and financial reorgani-
zation, Mr. Hawk said that the

code commission, revising the
present state school system, must
be accepted, He added, however-L
that its provisions are only a
beginning to education reform. ‘

A non-political state and canine
ty administration with the finan-
cial resources to equalize educar
tional opportunities in urban and
rural communities should be the
aim of iowans, Mr. Hawk said,

ger of federal control, while ad-
mitting that federal funds would
be necessary.

He called the ccc and NYA
emergency measures which began
to operate in competition with
public school systems. Describ-»
ing the situation of a su‘perin
tcndent in 1938 and 1939 whol
found “federally-operated, feder»'
ally controlled, federally finaiicedl
government instrumentaiities," .
Mr, Hawk said that practicallyI
every educational association in
the country voiced protest.

lncluded in his ideas of admin-
istrative reorganization was an
extended guidance program which
would “gear Johnny to the com.
munity and gear education to
Johnny." Basing his ideal upon
Horace Mann’s statement, “Edu-
cation is our only political safe-
ty,” Mr. Hawk said that the
schools must educate all children
in relation to their abilities and
needs,

in regard to teachers,
Hawk said we must pay them,
