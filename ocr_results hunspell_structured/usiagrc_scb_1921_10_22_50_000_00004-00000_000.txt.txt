spoke at Chapel Thursdcy morning,
tniring as his subject "Tlle Upward
Struggle of Men," In the alternuun
he spoke before the college women on
“Ideal Womanhood", and in the even-
ing he addressed the men on "Vil‘ile
Manhood.”

"Every living thing represents step
by step the history of its race." de-
clhred Dr. Hall in chapel. This, he
said, is the great: fundamental law of

race, he showed the different steps
