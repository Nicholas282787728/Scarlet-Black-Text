Sta-g Pep Meeting in Dining 11le
Marked by Stirring Talks on
Need for Spirit.

A short pep meeting was held in
Lhe men’s dining hall Monday eve-
ning. Short talirs were given by
Coach Elward, Capt. Nichols and Mr.
MacEachi-on. Excellent music was
furnished by the Serenaders.

Coach Eiward made a short lailr
ahout school spirit. He mentioned
the lack of proper support last year
and said, "Any fellow who lalks of
going to see another game while one
is being played here should be taken
:rom school." Mr. Elward also spoke
a! the Drake-Grinnell game last year
when the Grinnell routers called for
Boelter to carry the belt "This
spirit does not win foothall games,"
he Said. “We have 3 better team this
year than last and if we do not win all
the games we will at least win the
minority."

Captain Nichol's tallr was short
but very much to the point. He spoke
02 having a student body with plenty
oi pep and conﬁdence in the team.
"We can‘t win without pep," he
said.

ML NacEachron: “It is a good
thing to be good losers but this year
we don’t have to be good losers, we
can be good winners! -We have
weight, brains, speed, and fight." He
mentioned the need of a good band
and said that he dittored with the
Coach in one respect. This was that
we wae going to win all of the games
instead of must oi them '.

Sunday noon Thelma Sampson en-
tertained at a dinner party in honor

of Miss Sheldon, Miss Simmons and
Miss Sargent. The other guests
were, Jessie Cutler, Margaret Field,
Margaret Nofisinger, Genevieve Sar-
gent and Evelyn Forthun,

Par-sou Has smug Squad
Coach Glenn Devine, iormer star on
the University of Iowa team, will‘
bring a strong squad with him for the
game Saturday. Only two regulars
were lost last year by graduation
Scott, quarterback, and laughrige

spring and will not be in uniturm
Saturday. , . ,
The hopes oi the Parsons Squad res.
ceived a setback last Week, when two
of their best performers were injured ,
in scrimmage. These men were Dick
Bruckshnw, tackle, and Zen Erown,‘
bnltback. Whether these men will
be able topiary in the Grinnell game
or not is doubttnl. , .
For the line, Coach Devine will
probably use Hicks at center, Lindel
and Beauchnnip at guards, North and
llaasdam st tackles. and Sullivan,
Lawson, and Boyd at ends. Cossick
will be used at quarter. The rest of
the backfield will be picked from Jor—
dan. Stephenson, Baldel'son, Rice and
Smith.

The Parsons leftui is determined
to put up a better game than last
year. when Gl'lnuell won 14 to o. The
Pioneers are equally determined to
put the slrids under their first rivals
of thc season in first class tashiryn.
When these teams clash on Ward
Field Saturday, a good, hard—tought
game is expected. With so little dope
available, the sport fans are waitr
