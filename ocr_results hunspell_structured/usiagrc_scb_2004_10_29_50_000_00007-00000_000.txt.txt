This sunday is Halloween, or as
rhose who love apostrophes and annoy-
ing correctness would say, Halloween,
so we gotta have a scary movie on
campus. Besides the Tb: Village. And
Cnnlwl Robin's a scary example of
American diplomacy, but still, neither
of rhose have pea soup vomit.

77;: Exams], for those of you too
scared to have seen this movie previ—
ously, is about Regan, a scary little girl
(Linda Blair) in Washington, 13.0.
who may be possessed. By Demons!
Her mother (Ellen Burstyn) does the
sensible thing and calls in two priests,
one of whom (Max von sydow), just
got back from Iraq.The Iraq thing isn't
crucial, but srill, Iraq. Anyway, Regan
vomits some more and twists her head
around, while everyone gets freaked
out, even though they can see all the

strings director William Friedkin res
lied on.

This is a really good horror movie,
You can tell because studios keep re-
packaging it and shoving it into the:
atres. A directors’ cut of Tlrr Exanirl
was released in 2000, containing a re-
ally scary part where Regan walks like
a spider down the stairs. This year, Ex»
artist: TIM Beginning came out, and was
had. Here’s an excerpt ofa review by
Tb: War/ringtbn Pails Stephen Hunter:
"It manages a trifecta of pain: It’s dull,
it’s grim, it’s stupid. How’s that for a
recommendation?”

I can’t explain why T17: anvairl is
so great. Describing all the scary parts
makes it sound hilarious, in part be—
cause movies like Scary Moaie have
been aping it incessantly In part, it sutr
vives on subtlety and good use or tog.
lfyour midsem grades and the election
polls aren't freaking you out enough,
head for the Forum this weekend.

Smith’s ﬁnal farewell

Technology is great because now
all songs are eternal, even after their
singers die: We can still listen to Lens
non, Hendrix and Strummer. This au—
ral lingering is possible for songs that
aren’t ﬁnished.While Elliott Smith lam
bored on songs for his sixth solo album
since 2001, he did not ﬁnish From a
Hartman! an (1 Hill before his senseless
death last October, Thanks to diligent,
respectful workby his fame
ily and friends, his music is
now complete.

Elliott Smith was a
devastatingly introspec—
tive musician,yct his songs
are famous mostly for be
ing plugged into Grad Will
Hunlirlg and The Royal
Tenaabaamr. The songs
snatched for those movies
camefromSmith’sinrimare
and raw earlier albums,
Smith’s last three CDs, in-
duding Fm» a Barmam,
are more elaborate studio works,which
have contradicted Smith’s fans expev
tations of a whiskeyesoakcd, sad voice.

The studio tricks on the opens
ing track “Coast to Coast" are terriﬁc,

From a Base-
ment on the Hill
Anti (2004)

with dissonant strings sounding like
the precursor for a message from be-
yond the grave.These wellsorchestrated
big sounds are scattered among Smith's
traditional rough, guitar-only tracks,,
which are lonely yet also quite compass
sionatc.

Listeners could easily apply rhcse
songs to Smith’s apparent suicide.
Songs titled "A Fond Farewell,” “A

Passing Feeling" and “Last
Hour” make this Tutoriab
level analysis,but Smith al-
ways sang sad songs. More
uncharacteristic are several
thudding, trite lyrics, like
“You belong tagging along/
and I belong in a zoo" in
“Coast to Coast."

From a 3425mm)! an tbs
Hillwon't replace “Hey Ya"
at Harris, nor is it the chart
ry on top of a painful, pithy
life, but it is Elliott Smith’s
best work in several years.
It may not be precisely the album Smith
wanted, but its familiar warm, friendly,
depressing sound, is welcomed by his
fans.

Tbe Village is just a little cheesy, it
gets its job done, whether you like it or
not.With this ﬁlm, M. Night Shyama»
Inn is well on track to becoming a sort
of modern Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock,
he includes himself somewhere in ev-
ery one of his ﬁlms, has some hits and
some misses, and ﬁnds suspense in a
variety of situations. Having his brand
of handetlnging psychological tens
sion re the subjects of domestic ghosts
and alien invaders, he now takes on the
historical drama.

Tba Village is sct in isolated, nine-
teenthrccnmry Pennyslvania, among
those lovely, haunting woods otthe sort
featured in that old classic, Blair Wilt/av
Project. Cut off from the rest of the
world, the members of this self-sustain—
ing community keep mysterious ritus
als against monsters in the woods and
have really pretty wedding parties, but
underneath this veneer of order, some
rhing's awry in paradise. Without the

characters are ultimately the outcasts—
the strong silent Joaquin Phoenix, the
vaguely blind girl, and Adrien Brody as
the village idiot move the plot forward
as they unwittingly threaten to expose
the dark secrets of the town.

If you want to wager a guess at
the proverbial skeletons in the town’s
closet, they’re not all that hard to figure
out, but if you buy into the premise, the
film is pretty fun. The Village combines
the terrifying fear otboth real and psyr
chological monsters with the primitive
living situation to create a potential
political allegory of tear and isolation.

In the end, this contemporary con-
text of the film either makes or breaks
it, depending on how much disbeliet
you are willing to suspend. But hon-
estly, the monsters are scary enough
that I spent the whole way home from
seeing the ﬁlm looking for red eyes in
the cornﬁelds alongside Highway 6.

Control Room (NR)

With constant in—depth coverage, from The New
York Timer (0 Fox News, by way of Tbs Daily Sbaw
and Fahrenheit 9/11, it seems almost impossible that
there is any aspect of the Iraq war that Americans
haven’t looked at. But when was the last time you
watched aleazeera? I know, most Grinnellians can’t
speak Arabic, and Mediacorn doesn’t get the Arab
news station, at least not in Loose Lounge, but very
few ofus have listened to a news source that has been
viliﬁed by the Bush administration as harshly as any
thing save Hussein and bin Laden.

Caaimleanehane Noujairn's gripping, detailed
documenrary covers al-Jaaeera's news coverage ofthe
“ofﬁcial"lraq war, from Bush’s request that the Huss
seins leave the country to his "Mission Accomplished”
speech on the USS Lincoln. AlsJazeera, based in Qa-
tar, is the most watched TV station in the Arab world,
with ratings only Friend: could match.They attempt
to present an independent source of news without ta-
boos, including video otAmerican hostages taken by
Iraqi soldiers.

Noujaim mixes al—Jazeera's footage of the war,
largely exploding bombs and bloody civilians, with
theirjournalists’ work at CentCom, the US. Depart-
ment of Defense’s press facilities during the war. SeVs
eral reporters share their own feelings on the war, in
both Arabic and English, and convey rhe perspective
of the typical Arab, who is suspicious of the U.S.’s
true objectives. The American military ofﬁcers they
interview come oer not as doublerralking, two-faced
Rumsfeldsian villains, but sympathetic young men,
there to do a mission that they may find somewhat
faulty

Noujaim, who got much ofher training on MTV’s
Tbe Real World, certainly has good timing for her real—
ity films. Her last film, Slailllfsmm, is a poignant look
at the bubble bursting on the dotcom community.
Now with Iraq back in the news thanks to the presi—
dential election (editorial: takejosh Hartnett and Ron
Livingston's advice and vote. For Kerry.) and reports
of stolen explosives from facilities that the U.S.—led
provisional government should have protected, Cons
trol Room is an apt addition to Harris, even though it
documents how America “won" the “war," not how it
lost the peace.
