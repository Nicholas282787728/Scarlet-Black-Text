Policies 0i
llilmlssluns and
Financial lild
disordered

To the Editor-

In recent years, most quality liberal arts
Schools, including Grinnell, have main
tained a commitment to provide adequate
financial assistance to students unable to
pay the full cost of their education Unfol'r
tunately, the trustees and the financial aid
department have now iound it necessary to
seriously compromise this policy. They
have decided to set a quota on the number
of "highrneed" students who will be allow-
ed to enter Grinnell It is notable that the
"need-blind" admisswns policy should be
axed right after college officials justified
next year‘s tuition increase on the basis at
maintaining that same need-blind admis-
sions policy it would be interesting to see
the administration's explanation of this in-
consistency,

The recent change in policy was ignited
by iederal proposals to reduce iederal aid
However, these cuts are. it anything, all
the more reason for Grinnell to maintain
its present financial aid policy with
students able to obtain less in federal aid,
the most reasonable policy would be to ex
tend more or Grinnell's private monies to
needy students, rather than denying them
an education. It would be of considerable
benefit to the college’s image and prestige,
if, in the face of national financial aid
retrenchment. it continued providing
education on the basis of academic merit.
rather than family fianancial status,

It will be argued that Grinnell can no
longer afford to prowde that kind of
monetary assistance ior its students I
would suggest that the problem lies not in
a lack of money at. this college but in a
disordered sense of priorities as to What to
do with that money

[Members of] the Board of Trustees,
enraptured by the praise and publicity
they have received ior their handling oi
the college‘s endowment, have become
obsessed with increasing the college
monies as an end in itself. rather than as a
means toward any tangible betterment oi
the college There has even been a pro

posal to embark on an investment scheme
which would tie up several thousand
dollars ior ioa years! How can the trustees
justify this wild speculation into the dis
tant future it they cannot aiiord to provide
ior the Grinnell student oi next year"

it will also be argued that the number oi
people aliected by the new policy will be
small and most people will continue to
receive aid on the basis of need, as in
previous years. But. now that the college no
longer ieels it has a commitment to pro
vioe education without regard to iamily
iinancial status, there will be no barrier to
further the retrenchment of college finan»
ciai aid, as soon as the trustees iind it
iinancially ieasible to do so. Unless this
new financial aid policy is nipped in the
bud. l982 will mark the beginning oi an era
in which a Grinnell education became the
domain oi the wealthy. 7 Pete Erspamcr

To the Editor:
in the March 12 copy oi the 5&5. 1 notice
ed an editorial entitled “Violence to
women becoming a Crime“ tradition " in
‘the editorial the author made the come
merit, ”Rape seems to pop up every time
Grinnellians gather ior furl." This state
ment is more than a little misleading, i
would like to ask the author if he ielt that
this condition was prevalent at the Fall
Waltz or any oi the North Lounge dances
or in the Pub. Obviously this is not the
case.

While 1 commend and support what the
author was trying to say, I condemn his
methods The idea oi rape and violence to
women is repugnant to everyone on this
campus and I will assert that the concepts
oi murder and arson which are also listed

are as important or serious. I, however,
iind them quite serious.

lithe author had taken the time to inter-

also found that the comments put on the
poster were done by a second party If we
find someone's actions or comments in
poor taste or oiiensive we should critiCZe
the comments and leave the person out of
it in this instance, only the comments
should have been printed not the picture.

This brings me to the last point oi this
letter, that being the personalization or an
issue. Whether knowingly or not, when the
author and the Shit; printed that picture
along with the editorial, they identified the
pictured student with the issue of violence
to women on this campus, On a campus of
such a small size and composition like
ours, it is vet difficult to alter a picture
enough to disguise the party involved.
especially when the person's nickname is
included The picture should never have
been printed In the stud in the first place
While lam certain that thc Shls feels it has
protected itself from any charges ol libel,
it is certainly open to charges of innuendo.
Luckily for it, this is not a chargeable of~
l'ense beiorc the law By printing that pic-
ture, the stall has irreparably damaged
the character oi a student on this campus
I feel that the editorialist and the 5&8 owe
this student some sort oi an apology ior
their actions 7 Linda Sherry and Marc

To the Editor:

As a junior and a iirst year student aid»
viser I would like to comment upon the re-
cent policy instituted in the selection bi
next year": student advisers I believe the
reiorms made in the existing process oi
selection have addressed legitimate con
cerns which the student body and the ad
ministration have had about the quality oi
candidates applying ior the positon.
However, I ieei that these innovations
have been largely nullified by what can on-
ly be described as a great deal oi personal
bias and backroom politics on the part of
the selection committee.

These unfortunate developments have
led to a number of rather arbitrary deeir
sions in which several returning student
advisers as well as promising first year
candidates have been summarily dismisss

ed despite good recommendations from
their floor members. In addition, the
students dismissed have absolutely no
recourse once such a decision has been
made

it is due in part to this attitude reflected
by the selection committee that I have
chosen not to return next year as a student
adviser. i only ask that Student Affairs
closely reexamine the selection process to
eliminate the iniluence oi personal pre-
Judices in the future, as well as attempt to
redress wtat has been done to those in-
dividuals ‘Nhtl have been treated so are

As a parent financmg an intellectual

concerning tenure denial, dismissal oi

Reading the paper or late, 1 am ready to
take up arms concerning the plight oi Dan

associated with a number oi academic in-
stitutions over the years and i have never
bciore heard oi one in which an emeritus
proiessor irom another department had so
much input into such a major decision

Even at the unversity where I am
employed, known colloquially as the coun~

Langan, Cloud’s Team capture intramural titles

by leit Raymond

The games were contrasts in styles; the
ilashy, quick teams With outspoken
players against conservative. steady
teams with more mildrmannered players.
Gates took an unblemished record into the
championship game of the Dorm League
against Langan and seemed intent on
finishing the season without a single loss.
The Special interest League game that
followed pitted Satan's Legion ill against
relatively unheralded Cloud's Team Una
fortunately, a snafu kept the teams from
playing in Darby and the championships
had to be determined last Tuesday in the
PEC before a Sparse crowd. Referees Billy
Joos and Mike Randolph manned the
whistles at both contests and called the
games closely.

The teams in both games were surpris-
ingly well matched and played exciting
basketball. In the Dorm League game,
Langan used its slight height advantage
and an unexpected tenacity under the
boards to post a lead of 18717 at the half.
Tom Hanseter and Dave Peterson keyed a
rally that put Gates ahead in the second
half. Hanseter Canned both halves of a one
and-one to build a 35432 lead with time run-
ning out. Langan went down the court

where stu McKee had gotten position
under the Gates defense McKee took a
pass and converted it into a basket to cut
the Gates lead. Peterson was fouled on the
next possession and with 17 seconds leit in
the game had a chance to ice the contest by
converting a onerandeone His first shot
went awry. however. and Langan worked
the ball downcourt,

ltick Richardson, a steady Langan perr
iormer, hit a short jumper that gave his
team a 36-35 lead with only five Seconds to

squad got into position for a shot as time
ran out bul the ball bounced off the rim and
left Langan with the championship and
Gates with an untimely first loss.

Two Langan players. chris Caris and
Mike Poulos, quickly donned the red and
white uniforms of Satan's Legion Hi to
play ior their second shot at a champion
ship in one night. ironically, the unitorms
that the team bought created some pron
blems as players twice threw passes at a
similarly uniformed referee.

Cloud’s Team had the height advantage
in the game and was able to neutralize
