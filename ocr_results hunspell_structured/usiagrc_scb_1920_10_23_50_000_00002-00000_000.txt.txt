“DUCK DRAKE”

Speaking of loyalty, wllat about
"ducking Dialie”? For the next week
everybody on the campus should be
thinking “duck Drake”, and it
think we are going to do it, and really
go after it, nothing can stop us. There

J'is one thing that will beat us. it is
the idea which some of the student
body have that this is not the year
tor us to beat Drake. it you are one
oi those with that idea, get it out of
your head. We will admit that lt is
going to take a lot oi good hard toot-
hall, and a lot at good solid pep to
beat Drake, but it can be done,

Two years ago, the Drake grime.
looked almost hopeless, but the team
went down there with a determina-
tion to win, and they brought back,
the long end ot a 72 to 0 score. This
year the team is going into the Draltc
game tvrth the same determmatio ,
and the student body is going to back
them to thedast ditch.

There ale many reasons advanced
for our having lost the Ames and
Washington games, One oi them is

we

I

that our pep is not the good, solid
variety, but the hysterical variety.
The way to remedy this is to hold
‘our yep until the game, and then let
it hurst with all the force and lung
power we have. By good, solid pep
we mean the kind that does not spend
itsclt bciore the garlic, and incident:

 

ally. get everybody at the point where
they break within five nlinutes alter-
the game starts.

Another suggestion is that we lea
our college yells. We do not have
many, and what we‘do have lose their-I
effectiveness because we never ycll
them the same way twice, and conse-
quently nobody knows which variation
of the yell we are using. Let‘s learn
our- yells and then go after Draltc
with determination, hacked by good,
hard work, and we cannot help but
"duck Drone".

EXAMINATION LOYALTY

there is one kind of loyalty which We
