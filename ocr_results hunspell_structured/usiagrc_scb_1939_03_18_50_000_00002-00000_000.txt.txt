ﬁhﬁumllou IS BEGINNING

This weekend we have had on the campus
some 60 high school seniors who presumably
will compose the upper crust of next year‘s
freshman class. Most of their attention has
of course been directed toward examina—
tions, but between times, who knows, they
mav well have had a preview of themselves
two and three years from now. And this is
all quite fitting; since they will be coming
to college to be educatedi‘is they have been
carefully told, certainly— * is well that their
education begin at once.

Before they left. someone must surely
have given them a glimpse of the drawing
rooln witll dmenports appropriately popu»
lated—one lesson not to be overlooked. And
someone else has no doubt shown them the
interior of the White House and explained
exactly what goes on behind the smoke
screen. The function of quiet hours has been
pointed out, and the reason for holding
cgancl at 9 am, has been carefully explain~
e .

The library’s function as a passageway
from the Alumni Recitation hallgthere is
a sign up about that SOmeWhei‘eialld its
incidental conveniences have been made

l
clear, and the secrets of the system {01

answering roll call in philosophy class may
at least have been hinted at. Alld this is
well, say we. Understanding all this, these
high school selliors are \\ ell on the way to
becoming good Grinnellians; they are a
whole lap ahead of the freshmen who will

come without an inkling of what it is ally

about.
But is this so good? Do we want them to
be “good Grinnellians'Z”

ALL QUlET ON THE WESTERN FRONT?

During this week's nnpleasantness in Eu
rope, the guarantors of the CZecho-Slovah
state have been unusually quiet, The great
western democr cies didn’t dare to lift a
finger. (And their tlesire to do so is to be
doubted even more than their courage).
These western powers have seen:
i Japan take Manchur | and the North—
ern Provinces.
. Italy take Ethiopia.
' . Germany take Austria.
. Italy and Germany
selves in Spain.
Germany take S etenland and go on
to make Czecllo-Slovakia into a “doe
mastic dependent nntion.”
Each step is a blow to their power, pres
tige and economic interest, and at each step

establish them-

Englalld and France have preferred to back‘

down, thinking that the cost of prevention
was too exorbitant.

The “bull" fighting has been in Spain,
but with Franco’s conquest Germany and
Italy now go into the larger arena of Eu-
rope and the Mediterranean.

When will the flight from honor stop“.7
When will France and England make up
their minds that Germany's and Italy‘s ill-
terests are not their interests! Lewis Mum—
ford in his new book, Men Must Act. quotes
Senator Borah as saying, while looking at
the French army and British fleet, “How
much armament does it take to put guts ill
a person “.7" Mumford writes very persuasive
ly against the appeasement policy and ends
his book with all exllortation that “Demo—
cracy must dare,” before it is too late.

As we see that all seems quiet on the
western front, we nevertheless know (using
General Butler’s phrases) that the men of
the French army and British navy are not
being trained to be dancers, that some time,
some where ill Europe, a show down will
take place between Germany and her 351*
versaries, And then where will America be?
\Vhat will it do?

Nathaniel Peffer savs, “America can stay
out of war, but it won t. It won’t because it
will not wish to . i . . How long would all
the irrefutable but abstract arguments
about the comparative value of trade and
war costs withstand the gathering wave of
passions?”

THE DOCUMENTS

IN THE CASE

By Dorothy L. Sayers

and Robert Eustace

If you are not of the cult that
reaches for a murder mystery as
its bed-time story, don't start on
this train!

“The Documents in the Casc"|
is a fairly satisfying murder my-
stery. Following the epistolary
plan used unsurpassingly many
years ago by Wilkie Collins in
"The Women in White," this no-
vcl allows the reader free rein
to deduce from those most re-
volatory of human documents, per-
mm letters, the who and the
why of the crime.

There are three principal sets
of letter writers, though only out-
going letters are given. A man,
victim of a scratchy second inur-
riage, a gourmet, and an author-
ity on edible fungi, writes to his
son, the Paul Harrison who sets
the documents before the pub-
lic: a young author finishing a
“Life" and the apartment com-
panion to a genuinely talented

 

maiden lady who lives for and
loves her neuroses, and writes to
her married sister, Olive, to tell
her about them and how they
perform.

The second half of the story
headed “Analysis" offers excerpts
trim the daily papers upon the
trial cuttings from articles on
fung , coroner's jury reports, etc,

Al. this point the reader‘s in-
torcst will either flag or he cone
sideiably heightened: the first, if
he is amused by the unconscious
Iy revealed quirks of mind and
character, or second, if he en~
joys the scientific discussion of
synthetic products, light refrac—
Lion. and things pharmaceutical.

All in all, the hook is hardy
up to the Sayers standard as it
appears in “Candy Night" and
”Busman's Holiday," for exam»
ple, though there is the embryo -
ic promise of these books present.
one misses his old friend, Lord
Peter, though that aristocratic
gentlemen would find himself
Longllcrtied in most of the preacnt
company.

if, then, you like to read other
people's letters especially when
they give themselves away in ev-

ery line of script, if you can take
a murder, not too harrowing but
harrowing enough. read the first
part of “The Documents in the
Case” and stop. Continue into the
chemistry laboratory and the tech—
nical minuta of the mushroom at
your own risk! ~

Medium income.

Miss Taylor pointed out the
munerous opportunities in both
private and public social work
service.

She said that one-third of the
families in the U. s. get a medium
income of $440 annually, and if
we are going to have an upgrade
in our standard of living we must
spread mole education among the
poverty class.

Social Service Work

While social service is not a
poorly paid profession, much of
the compensation comes from sat-
isfaction given by the work, she
concluded

Phillips told the teaching for-
um three ways to secure positions.
using a teachers‘ agency, writing
letters of application, and by mak-
ing contacts.

Masters’ Degree

He stressed the importance of
extra-curricular activities in con»
sio‘eration for a position and said
that a master’s degree is needed
by a teacher seeking a better pose
