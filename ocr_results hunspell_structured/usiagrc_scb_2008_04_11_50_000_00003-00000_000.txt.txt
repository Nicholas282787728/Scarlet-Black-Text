danons made for onrcampus
housing prevent overcrowding
in the dorms.

Many students treat off-
campus eligibility as a reward
of upperclassman status, but
this is not always the case, as
automatic approvals are tare
and every year some seniors
are denied.

Automatic approval for
living ohtcampus is only
granted to students in four
circumstances, Ifa student has
substantial medical documen-
tation that they need special
accommodntions, they will

be offered ortrcampus living
regardless of class status or-
room draw number. Students
who are 22 years old by Sept.
1 ofthCir ofrrcampus year, snr
dents; living with their parents
in Grinnell and students with
a child are also granted auto-
matic approval.

Contrary to popular belief,
the college does not have a
policyto guaranteeoffreampus
approval for married students,
though Student Affairs Tech-
nical Assistant Laura Gogg
slutl they have been able to err
tend offers to all such students

in the past.

Though 21 seniors odds of
being granted off—campus ap—
proval is fairly high in any gn”
en year, some students believe
a fourth-year student should
be guaranteed off-campus ap-
prowl.

“I think you should be
able to live where you want,"
said SGA President-Elect
Neo Morake '09. Moralte has
petitioned for guiuanteed otfr
campus houb’ing for seniors
and believes three years in
the dorms earns students the
right to live in town itthey so
choose.

Administrators say that the
college’s decision to not guarr
antee ofrreampus approval tor
all senior-s is due mosrly to an
interest in keeping Grinnell’s
on-ciimpuo‘ lire intact. Student
Attairs tries to cap the numr
ber of orrreampus students at
a number that takes into con-
sidei'tition how many snidents
will be abroad that semester
and how large they anticipate
the incoming class to be.

“It's a residential college, so
we like to have the residential
balls as full as possible,” said
Gogg, “but we also want to
accommodate those rising e,
niors, and hopehilly the ri ng

juniors as well—to let them
have that off-campus Expul-
ence.”

Morake said she believed
that olfrcampus students
do not threaten, but rather
strengthen Grinnells commu-
nity. “Most people live Within
a threcrblock radius of the
campus, Morake said. "They
have activities that happen at
their houses They take classes.
They are still interacting with
the community on campus "

Despite the debate over
automatic approval, some stu-
dents, like Loosehead sena—
tor and Housing Committee
membci Anna Gilbert '09, felt
that this year's decision process
was less contentious than it ofc
ten is because of the increased
approvals. “1 don't think its so
controversial this year because
so many seniors were acceptr
ed," said Gilheit.

This year, we were able
to extend offers to all students
who had automatic approval
and all students who were
eurrenrly either ﬁrstesemester
fourth years or second-semes-
ter third yeaus,”said GoggAll
other apphcants and those
who “considerably" missed the
deadline were placed on the
waiting list.

Funding difficult to find for speaker

iiv KATIE MCMULLEN

Grinnell college is often lauded for its tremendous endowr
ment which enables the school to bring a multimde of speak»
ers, shows and other events to campus But while the college's
ﬁnancial resources are extensive, gaining access to them is not
always easy, Allie Kossoy 'os learned this the hard way in try
ing to raise money to bring renowned doctor and motivational
speaker Patch Adams to campus.

l<ossoy became interested in bringing Adams to campus
after seeing him speak at the University ofVirginia. After that
event she contacted the lectures organizer to learn about what
it would take. “l learned that it cost $20,000, and actually that's
the reduced priee,"she said. “Myjaw dropped,”

However, learning
that the proﬁt from the
speech would go towards
timding the Gesundheitl
Institute, which aims
to provide free health
care to all orits patients,
Kossoy remained deter-
mined ro bring Adams
to campus,

Throughout the
spring of2007, Kossoy sought funding through the President’s
Fund, the Lily Program, and the Rosenﬁeld Program. After re
ceiving 54,000 from Rosenfteld, l<ossoy turned to the Office of
college and Alumni Relations to make up the differenee, She
met with Vice President Mickey Munley '37, who told her that
his othce could supply some orthe funding but not all.

“[Munley] said he would meet me halfway,"said Kossoy.

Having exhausrcd her options and in need of 53,000 more
to meet lVlunley’s stipulation, l<ossoy turned to solve All
Campus Events (ACE) Committee in the (all of 2007. On
September 19th,2007, in the first session othiint Board for the
hill of2007, ACE presented its recommendation.

“ACE Committee initially recommended that we allocate
31500," said T] Hawley '10, cooidinator of ACE Committee.
SGA has never allocated more than 83,000 to bringing any one
speaker to campus.

Despite the recommendation .u precedent, however, Joint
Board voted to approve 55,000 to bring Patch Adams to earn

us.
P "ACE Committee was veiy surprised.” said l—lawley. “it's
notvery common that the committee recommendation isn't ac-
cepted by joint Board."

“Thule are multiple rcasonsl think SGA gave it,"sairl Kcsr
soy, “One is because they knew I had exhausted all the other

options and two because they knew how big ofa deal it was to
the student body. ”

Joint Board's surprising budget approval was not without
contestatlon, however. “I didn’t expect that Joint Board would
stray so far fiom what ACE had recommended," sold Allison
Amphlett ’08. Amphlett, after reading the minutes ofthe Sepr
tember 19th was concerned with the actions ofjoint Board.

"It was really early in the semester, so a signiﬁcant por-
tion of these senators were first time senatois who had never
approved budgets my concerns mostly were with the large
amount or money and that they were sort of hasty in their not
rions, said Amphlett.

Amphlett's concerns were brought before Joint Board at
the tollowing week’s meeting on September 26, 2007. Senator
Laura Liencmann '08 moved to reconsider the Patch Adams
budget approval, and Amphlett expressed her concerns. The
matter was debated at some length.

“I didn't really expect that they would take the tnoney away,"
said Amphlett. “ I just wanted them to be aware of what they
had done, sort otbetrayeri what students expected to occur. No
one had time to express opinions on it because it was so dirrer-
ent from what happens."

A motion in Joint Board to rescind the budget failed. Kosr
soy said she thought the decision to fund the speech was valid
given scrA's ﬁnancial tesources."l know it’s important to spread
out the money," said l<ossoy. “But SGA gets a lot more than I
think people realize, and there’s only so much you can spend on
sn' cks and parties “

"lyurr wanted them to be aware
ofwahr they had done, tort of
betrayed Whatsmdenli expected
to occur”

With the 55,000
awarded from SGA.
54,000 from the Rosen-
neid program, and
51,000 rrom Tom Crar
dy, Kossoy met her goal.
The remaining $10,000
procured through Mickr
cy Municy is an "huth

from the Office orcnllege and Alumni Relations,

Seven other

a few vehicles to attend the day-and~ashalf conference which
was broken down into 13 student panels ranging from topics like
“Gender and Peacebuilding" to “Contributions of 105 [Internar

At the beginning nfrhe corifcrcncc,our keynote speaker,Dr.

seeking out good “1’
formation about global
problems, acting in line with our values and recognizing our own
limits,

I had never heard an articulation of such clear and speciﬁc
goals for those of us committed to building peace,

Specifically. he suggested that as individualswe “ﬁnd a hole
in the World and fill it,"r’-\s students he urged us [0 build a “peace
wiki" which would contain resources, plans, and suggestions for
our future, while as corn
sat-tiers we support organi-
zations that promote and
support human rights.

The student panels
were equally wellrrcr
searched, rooted theory
and chock—full ortangible
r suggestions for our tumre.

Students were given 15720

minutes to present issues
(or which they had done extenSive research or projects that they
themselves had been a part. I was intrigued to hear what the sur-
dents- had to say on a topie as idealistie and as broad as “peace.”

Despite the diversity among the presentations, I noticed a
fair amount of overlap between them. Most of the student pans
elists emphasized empowerment, building social consciousness,
collaboration, focused emluatlon ofexisting programs and deep
listening of needs on the ground,

As I listened to business outlines, economic suggestions,
environmental discussions, case
smdies of NGOs working for
women's rights, and sociological
explanations of contlict, l was
reminded just how interdiscir
plinary peace studies is. it was
extremely valuable to listen to
the collaboration and synthesis
of so many ideas from creative
and motivated students

I was a little behind with
