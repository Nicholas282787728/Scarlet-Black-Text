thn Frank Rarlrio '50 entered Griiiiiell in Scprcmhcr
1946, he lived in what he called the “barracks," a residence fol
married couples located not far riorn who . the college would
build East campus more than 50 years later .

Rathje, who had just returned from actual harracks in his
tour ofduty in \h’oi‘ld Vl/iii' II, went on to a Succ ful career in
commercial lending. Yesterday the college dedicated East Hall

D in honor of Rathje, a
major donor.
. The Griniiell cam-
pus in 1945 was hill of
veterans like Rathje,
who had served in the
Paciﬁc front and fought
at lwo Jima. “I never lt
like an oursidcr,"irc said.
“In the 1950 graduating
class,enteiing in ’46,a high pcrcenrwcrc \'c|s.VVc were all birds
ofa feather."

The 1940s were momentous years for Rathje. “Before I
went to Council I was inst a typical 18—year—old who didn't
have much in the way of goals,” he said. “[Aftei] scwice, mar-
ii- igc, and coming to Grinnell I learned that I had to have goals
and work h.ird to get rhcrc

Though Rathje his only been hack to Grinnell twice since
graduation (for his tooth and tittierrrth icunioiis), he his main—
tained a strong relationship with the college. Rathje has been
a “major supporter of the college financially," said Neill Goltz,
Director of Planned Giving, “His gifts are an expression of
gratitude for the education he
received here."

Rathje credired his Grinnell

education, along wirli his mili-
my service, as helping him larcr
in life Grinnell taught me you
navel stop learning and you have
to constantly apply yourself to the
changes going on in society and
the environment," Rathje said. “I
learned a great deal oftliat in my
experiences at Grinncll."
He has worked closely with the development ol‘frcc fOl
many years and has given a substantial slim to the college, said
Golr‘z, who has known Rathje for close rn rive ye ice he
