Tom Zlabinger: Welcome Thank
you for taking the time to do this
interview.

GRAN: Thank you.

TZ: What was the original inspira-
tion for the formation of the GRAN
Quanet in 1980?

G: We worked together at a music
college inthecity of Mineralniyevodi.
When Nicolai arrived in 1980 from
Ilyanovsk where he played in a sym-
phony orchestra the last link of the
chain wasfound. Wefeltanimmedi-
ate connection and showed a mutual
enthusiasm, We have been making
music together from that day to the
present

John Stuhr~llommereirnl And has
the membership remained the same?
G: Just the violin has been changed.
Gennadijoined the group eight years
ago when the previous violinist had
problems with his hand.

TZ: Is this yourflrsttourtoAmerica?
G: Yes, but we have toured outside
of Russia several times, including
trips to Bulgaria and West Germany,
We also have toured extensively
within Russia. to the Ulals, to Sibe—
ria, Moscow. St. Petersberg. We
have toured very frequently.

TZ: While you've been on yourtour
so far, what do you ﬁnd different
about performing in countries out-
side of Russia? How are the atmo
sphere and customs different?

G: It’s hard for us tojudge people’s
reaction wour conccns. chan only
judge on the basisof our impressions.
Still, our concerts seem to have gen-
erated considerable interwt, just as
we have a strong desire to play well
and to please our audience.

We have liked the places where
we have played; we‘ ve had good
stages, good instruments to play on.
It is very important that we have a

good piano. I have constantly played
on fine Steinways, Yamahas — yes-
terday was a Kawai, then, attire same
placelplayed aBaldwin. [Tonight’s]
concert will be on a Steinway — the
best instrument in the world. in my
opinion.

Our concens seem to have been
very successful. People have reacted
very emotionally. That makes us feel
great!

J S-R: Is there anything that seems
different from Russia?

G: ltseems to me that the ﬁrst thing
that strikes one is the similarity;
People react similarly to music in
Russia and in America. I would say
tllat people in tile as. like classical
music. Classicalmusic is more widely
distributed here. You hear it notjust
inconcertbut also on the radio. When
I was staying in some American
friends‘ homes. I constantly heard
classical music.

.1 S-R: Is thatdifferent from Russia?
G: Yes. in Russia lately you hear
more heavy metal. But it will pass.
like everything does.

J S-R: But your impression is not
entirely normal. In general heavy
meal is probably stronger here than
in Russia.

TZ: How easy is it to get recordings
in Russia?

G: In our country, the availability of
classical music and culture is con-
centrated in the major cities: Mosr
cow and St. Petersburg. Concerning
the availability of records, tapes and
compact discs in the cities‘ periphr
ery. there is no problem mere. One
can always buy them. As far as the
majorcities are concerned, itis prob-
ably easier to get all those faster, to
use them and to understand them.
The concert halls ﬁll to overﬂowing,
even the large halls of the conserva—
tory and the large Philharmonic hall
in Leningrad. Music is accessible. it
is accessible to those who want it.
Ticket prices aren’t too high and are
very accessible to all. An exception
might be the Bolshoi Theater in MosA
cow because it is well-known abroad.
For Muscovites, attending concens
at the Bolshoi theater is difficult with
somany foreigners attending; itis hard
to find tickets. The Bolshoi Theater is
onlyoneplacebuteveryone whocomes
to Moscow wants to go there.

But on the other hand. compact
discs are virtually unknown in Rusr
sia. They cost a great deal. The
average person can‘t afford to buy a
CD player. it is very expensive in
Russia.

On the other hand, we have a lot
of LP: available. We are still in the
era of the LP. They are very incxpcnr
sivc and widely distributed. Since
Perestroika, the music industry has

notproduced CD players. The indus—
try has not reached that stage. People
use products made by better intema-
tional companies, such as Sony.

But. people have big collections
of LP‘s at home. There is a large
number of LP's available; there is a
technological gap, but nonetheless
people have a lot of music available
to them. On the other hand, newer
music recorded on CD tends to be
less available.

There is a complicated sinlation:
under socialism,when peopleplanned
to record classical music, Melodiya
Company —a well-known company
in Moscow 7 funded a series of
recordings. Butnow,you have topay
—— that is, you have to find sponsors.
People have economic concerns in
mind. It is harder to find sponsors.
Before, there was a uniﬁed program,
but now everything is dependent on
the individual.
J S-R: Is that a major problem?
G: Itisa temporary problem. Ithas
a positive aspect: now, if someone
has the money. he can record what-
ever he wants —— himself. his wife,
his little daughter. . .
J S-R: l-lis dog. ..
G: He can go and record the sound of
aplanc 7 whatever he wants. Over-
all, that is freedom. Well, every
development has two sides.
TZ: When the average Russian lisr
tens to music, does he or she usually
listen to live performances or record
ings?
G: We havenolicedthathcrc,peoplc
don’t sec’classical performances on
TV. Is that true?
J S-R: Just about —— there is almost
no classical music on TV.
G: Why not?

—l-lcy, this is not our interview.

Live classical concerts appear
fairly frequently on Russian televi-
sion.

On the other hand. classical
music has been curtailed on theradio.

That is one matter. If we are
talking about the average Russian,
we should say that in previous years.
the average person listened to classi-
cal music rarely. The people attend-
ing concerts are a certain level of the
populace. People on a lower socio-
economic level are not there.

TZ: In recent years, how has the life
of a musician changed in Russia’.7
G: Concerning professional musi-
cians, the whole world knows that
they are famous the world over. Vio-
linists as well as pianists, et cetera.
They are victorious in all the well-
known contests, The Paganini con-
test. the Tschaikovsky contest in
Moscow,theChopincontestetcetera.
That is, the level of culture is quite
high. The training is excellent in
Moscow and St Petersburg.

Butnow it is changed so that for
instance, if we can please Americans
with our art, we are free to negotiate
a contract. We have full freedom to
work here in America. For a month,
a couple of days, a year, five years.
Before, that would have been impos-
sible. The same in sports: before, all
sponsmcn worked by contract. The
situation has become better, freer.
This is an improvement because in
previous years. it would have been
impossrblc for us to travel here. Dan
Clark [Gran's American tour man—
ager] would be unable to help us.

Wltlt the economic difficulties
we have been experiencing. musical
life has become poor. Before
Gorbachev, under socialism. musi-
cians did a little bit better, materially

speaking. Freedom took that away.
The top musicians were well-off
before Gorbachev, and they still are
well-off. But the standard of living
for midalcvel musicians has wors-
ened. Concenlifein Moscow and St.
Petersburg was very intensive and
very interesting before Gorbachev,
and itremains so today. Butone who
lives inacapital and [in America] can
see all the world-famous artists. No
people who live in Kislovodsk are
able to pay the travel expenses and
have famous musicians come.
[Kislovodsk is where Gran is based]
Therefore, people in small cities do
not have the opportunity to hear live
music. That is very unfortunate. For
this reason, we who live there try to
perform as much as possible to com-
pensate for this fact. We take this as
our personal mission.
TZ: l’d like to know more about
your program entitled “Music of
Love." Where does that title come
from?
G: Music, in our understanding, is
rhevoiceofoursoul transformed into
musical sound. Whalis more,itislhe
voice of the soul of those who wrote
the music and the voice of God speak-
ing through nature. These great
people. Handel, Mozart. Beethoven,
Brahms: Ihosc to whom much was
given, they gave us a legacy of great
music. Their music cxprcsscs csscn-
lial joy of life. Life is beautiful be
cause God has made it so. This is
how we understand our work. This is
what we do with our hands, our in-
struments, our existence.
J S—R: This is the meaning, or value,
of your work?
G: This is how we undcrslzlnd the

essence of our artistic endeavor. We
