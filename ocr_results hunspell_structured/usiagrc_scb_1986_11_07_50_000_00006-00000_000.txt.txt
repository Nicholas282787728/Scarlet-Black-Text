SAT Scores
or

Diversity?

This Monday, the College faculty will
decide on one of two admission policies
that will affect the shape of Grimtell
College for years to come. A. crinnetl
moves toward the utattu of a “hot col-
lege“. the number of applicants has
been skyrocketing and consequently
the workload for the admit-inn board
has grown dramatically.

Thm, in an effort to streamline the
admission process, the faculty will
chome between two admt‘suion criteria
that will allow the admission. board to
more effectively review the flood ofap.
plciatianit. The main difference bet-
ween the two proposals is what rank
SAT score: would have in the admis-
sion review process: one proposal has
SAT score: ranked third behind an ap-
plicant's high school record and his or
her ‘Tassible contribution to the col-
lege community” and the other pro-
posul would mnk SAT scores second
behind the high school record.

(in the surface, the difference bet.
teeen these two policies may totem in-
significant, but there is u "all dif-
ferL'IlL'l' in the kind ofxtudont Grimm"
College will select by rant-tug sAT

trum but from the middle where the
dLntance between scores may be as little
as 25 points.

Now, with no little in 25 points
dittinguishing one student from
another on euch a highly subjective
lest, the college, if oyerating with. a
policy that place SAT scores second,
would select a student simply on their
higher ten more, This it no way to

With just 43 days lelt beiore I become an

and one half years that l have spent here.

tantly, however, I’m starting to ask
myseli: where do i go irom here?

Graduate school is definllely out ior
quite some time. so i guess that means rm
headed oil into the “real" world oi
employment. Since I’ve already devoted
a lot or my time, eliort, and money to
ascertaining some sort oi job; and since I
still haven’t uncovered any solid oppor-
lunltles for a steady income; I think that I
am justified in making my ”W|Sl| list” ior
jobs. Besides, there are just 49 days leil
until Christmas.

Ideally. I'd like to be a movie critic.

day. eat popcorn or raismelles. and drink
Coke to my heart's content, Best oi all,
people would actually consult me when
they planned their excuslcns to the
neighborhood movie theater. Then. in a
couple bl years. I could have my own syn-

worry about a script because the lormat ol

other movie critic about who had the besl

Sophie! Wait up! 1 have something here

By what can be considered only an act of

week a large creamrcolored envelope.

—
“For women only." read the cranberry
scrawl in the upper lelt~hand corner. So,
Soph, what do you think I found when I
opened it up? No, no 7 nothing embarrass-
ing like that. I found more cranberry
scrawl. “From the desk ol Jonna Lee
Goodman," no less. “Let us help you find
‘Mr. Right‘ in just six months or less," she
gushesl “Join now and you’ll Save $100!"
You guessed it, Soph. My first mail to
come in what seemed like an eternity was
from a dating service, INTRO SERVICES’
Personal Introduction Program, to be ex-
act How they gol my name and address,
I’ll never know but it can't have been ran-
dom chance. Janna seems to know me
from somewhere (Her letter begins,
“Dear Friend”); though. I don't Seem to
recall ever having met her, I wish I
weren’t so horrible with names. Anyway,
Jenna says right here in her letter that the
program works because “the mailing lists

we use are limited to individuals. . such as
you". so. I can only assume she's trying to
drum up business with the befuddled
collegersbphomore crowd. There was a
time when I might have thought this
strange, but I've learned not to question
the entrepreneurial genius or mavericks
like Janna. I’ll just pass on a little of the in-
lo to you. Here are some at me high points
of the deal:

They have quality men, . . you do have
quality men," tells one satisﬁed member.
“I was genuinely surpprised how many
your have. I mean, really quality men —
engineers, doctors, lawyers 7 lots oi them
—— men you just don't think are out there."

Ah, but what kind of “quality men?"
“[The type a man who participates in our
program] has brushed sowing his wild oats
and has reached a level of emotional
maturity . .where he recognizes that suc»
£655 in his work is empty without a caring,
loyal, compatible woman by his Side,"
Frankly, Soph, if this realization is proct
positive of his “maturity." I'm a little
skeptical, Most or the men whose
photographs are in the margins at the let-
ter are pretty old, some even look to be in
their fifties. And it's taken them this long
to develop what |S in itself quite a leeble
excuse for “emotional maturity?” This
gives me pause.

Jenna also says that these are “men who
wish to commit .. Commit what? 7 grand
larcenyi 7 themselves toa sanitarium? 7
the ingredients of their bottles of Grecian
Formula 9 to memory? Iwish Jonna would
be more specific.

rm trying to be positive about this tor
you Soph, but i worry about the type at
men they have here, They all have
numbers instead of names. MSOOZBGZ en-
joys volleyball. Romance is at the top at
the, list or M5001263. Msooqzlo bowls.
M3006119 enjoys roller skating, i don't
know what you've heard. Soph, but i heard
tell once that any guy who has a number
instead ol 3 name isn't such a hot bell
Prison identiﬁcation leaps to mindl
Besides, it these men are so great. why do
they deign to list themselves with Janna?

Well, Soph, it's up to you. it you do
decide to check this out, you better do so
quickly All the guys advertised are cur-
rently oiiered to you at a 20% savings — no
kidding A six»month membership (at
least ten dates. guaranteed) usually goes
for $490. bul. through this special offer.
those same ten dates can be yours tor a
‘mere $390. You need only pay $95 to start.
the balance will be billed to you later, Give
it some thought, but don't delay. You don't
know when their next sale will be,

opinion. Maybe it I was lucky, I might get
involved in the talk Show circuit and one
day become the host tor “The Tonight
Show."

Another prosperous venture would be for
me to coordinate and sponsor job fairs. It
ought to be quite easy, since there are
thousands oi people in the world so
desperate tor a job that they are willing to
shell out 15 bucks for the privilege of being
able to walk around in a mass of humanity
and distribute their resumes to prospec—
live employers. (Andy. Mark, Mike. and
myseli are living prcci oi that!)

If I were to sponsor job fairs I would also
want to get into the business of manuiac-
turing blue pin-stripe suits. white shirts,
and red Lies, Everybody at those job tairs
{eels some need to dress in the alormenr
tionetl apparel. so it only seems logical
that i should supply it

It would also be a lot of fun to work for
the U.S. Treasury as their “Ofﬁcial Money
Recycler,” I know that I’ll probably never
become the next Howard Hughes. but who
else would be able to say that every day
they think nothing of watching millions oi
dollars go up in smoke?

So what does all of mi: mean? ll means
that if there is a Sanla Claus out there
reading this. I hope he can accommodate,
Otherwise I guess that I‘ll have to be
satisfied with the humdrum cl the "real"
itol'ld and a “real" job. But then. or
Course, I could always go back to school. ..
