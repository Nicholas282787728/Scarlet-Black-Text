Volleyball Drops to 111th in Conference M Mal/y? @

By Julie Kaster

On Friday, Nov. 3, the Pioneers
unveled to Illinois College for the
conference championships, where
they finished 11th. The team came
peted in the “B” bracket, which
matched up the three lowest-tanked
teams fromboth the North and South
divisions.

I] the first match, the Pioneers
faccdRipon College and were forced
to use a 5-1 set-up instead of their
usual 62 look because starting setr
ter Amy Robinson wassidelincdwith
an ankle injury. The team adjusted
well to the switch, but played slugr
gishly after their eight-hour bus ride
tharmoming, The final scores were
I- 15 and 8- 15,

“The new setup was not a factor
in our loss." coach Sheila Cain said.
“Wejust did not play the game.”

Grinnell proved their strength and
spirit in their second match, against

Lawrence College. The team played
solidly, using their fundamentals to
create a tough offense as they estab-
lished consistency in their service
with 94 percent team completion.
Despite Grinnell's aggressive play.
Lawrence was stilla volleyball force
to be reckoned with and the Pioneers
found themselves on the losing end
of two games, 1015 and ll»15.
On Saturday,Nov.4,Grinnelltook
to the court early against apowerful
Monmouth College team. The Pio-
neers came out playing-tenaciously
and each player was in sync with the
others. As a result of hard play and
good execution, each ball was fall-
ing in a favorable spot for Grittnell.
On a few occasions, however, the
Pioneers’ rhythm faltered and Mon-
mouth took advantage of the let
downs. Grinnell could almost smell
the victories as they ended Willi close
scores of 11715 and 11-15.
Grinnell‘s final match of the

Midwest Conference Toumament
was a disappointing 6-15 and 4-15
loss to Illinois College. Slow move

ment and late decisions character .

ized Grinnell‘s game and the games
quickly slipped away from them.
The Pioneers were unable to prop-
erly adjust to the five»hour wait be-
tween match three and match four.

“If the team had played theweaker
teams as well as they did against the
stronger teams we could have fin-
ished in a position which reﬂected
our abilities," said Amy Robinson.

“Wewere unsatisfiedwithourdrop
to last place in the conference cone
sideringourtalentlevel,"CoachCain
said. “The thing that killed us was
our up and down play."

With only one senior graduating,
co-captain Ann Athorp, the learn
plans to realize its potential next
yearby mentally and physically pre-
paring for every match and concen-
trating on consistent execution.

Football Pioneers Lose Season Finale

By Mick Kulikowskt
and Steve Clem

The Pioneer football team ended
its season last Saturday, losing to
Illinois College 10—0, However, the
score fails to show the true nature of
three out of the four quarters played.

Grinnell had problems early, both
offensively and defensively. Illinois
College‘s offense took advantage of
firstAquarter scoring opportunities,
getting a 26-yard field goal and a
tworyard scoring run to start the
second quarter. After the 10-0 dell
cit. the defense tightened, holding
thestarrunningbackforIllinois,Scott
Crowder, under his usual rushing
average of 113 yards per game.

The Pioneer offense certainly had
its opportunities in the first half, but
was unable to punch the ball into the
endzone. Grtnnell had 12 firstdowns
compared to Illinois’ 10, passed for
more yardage (114-83). and again
did not commit a tumover. Meanr

while, the defense did its job with
aplomb, forcing two turnovers and
seven Illinois punts.

The Pioneers were hurtby six sacks
and a great number of penaltiw —
10 for 69 yards. These two factors
forced Grinnell into poor field posi-
tion, as well as long third-down
conversions. All of this. combined
with an early deflell, made the Pio~
neers throw more than usual. Thus,
Illinois College was able to rush the
passer and throw off the timing of
the pass patterns.

Grinnell finished the season with
a 376 record. But, as this column has
stated in the past, the final score did
not always indicate the way the
Pioneers managed to stay in the
game. In fact, take away a few cru—
cial plays, and the Pioneers would
have a 5-4 record.

Although the team loses 12 sen»
iors, the Pioneers have a good nu-
cleus of players for next season and
beyond. If Grinnell receives fresh-
