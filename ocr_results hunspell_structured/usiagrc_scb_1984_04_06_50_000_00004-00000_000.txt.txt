Rekindling the sports flame

It has certainly been an interesting week for sports fans,
and those of us who make a habit of devouring the infor-
mation on the sports pages and discussing almost
anything athletic couldn‘t be happier.

Last Monday featured two major events. First, there
was the opening of The Season as another seven months of
major league baseball gloriously unfurled before our
fastball-starved eyes. Secondly, the championship of the
NCAA basketball tournament was held that night, thus
concluding one of the most interesting, media-saturated
events this side of a presidential race.

Here at Grinnell we have been treated to a thought-
provoking symposium on “Sports and the National
Character." Even though attending the symposium may
not have brought a sports fan the same adrenaline rush
that watching a quarterback sack, a slam dunk or a
backhanded stab of a line drive would have, it did raise
and address several key issues facing athletics today.

It is almost impossible to become interested in athletics
without becoming aware of the issues that arise off of the
playing field. The symposium helped us to identify and
deal with the problems of modern athletics.

In addition to the drama of athletic competition, sports
buffs thrive on controversy. Grinnell College, where
sportsrelated controversy seldom means anything more
than disagreeing with a referee’s call on a televised con-
test, now has a significant controversy of athletic origin.

Mary Jane Constant has raised what may be a
legitimate gripe against Baseball Coach John Martinek
and the Grinnell Athletic Department because of their
reluctance to let her play baseball.

We are not going to judge Martinek’s decision to drop
Constant from the club because we can not judge her play-
ing abilities as well as he can.

However, we believe that it makes more sense to let
qualified ‘ women play college baseball than to let
designated hitters play major league baseball. And if the

objection to her presence on the team is a disagreement
with her political motivation, consider that the great
Jackie Robinson might be this century’s greatest black
politician.

On a related note, the silent assembly scheduled for
noon today is perhaps an overly dramatic but important
gesture in recognition of female athletes, There was only
one woman on the symposium panel (two were scheduled)
and the expanding world of women’s athletics was not
directly addressed in the symposium.

At this stage of life one editorial isn‘t going to attract
anyone to or discourage anyone from the world of sports.
Not everyone thinks that heaven is box seats along the
third base line, and that’s fine. But these past few days
have pumped new life into those of us who choose to dirty
our hands with the ink from the daily sports section.

So try to be nice when somebody asks, “How ’bout them

and complain about their high

“What are you going to do when
you graduate?"

That's the question a second
semester senior hears most ire
quently during his last spring
break. Being an individual of
academic inclination, I would
usually mumble something about
graduate school and try to change
the subject. The reactions that
greeted my admission of a desire
to pursue still more education
were appalling,

“When you want (7) to apply tor
a corporate position and you have
a PhD. in English." said my un-
cle the banker. “people assume
you're just a school teacher."

“Just” a school teacher? After
an investment at upwards oi
350.000 and, oh. say seven to nine
years of college all totaled. can an
individual with a doctorate be
rightly labelled “just a school
teacher?"

Those ‘mere' disseminators ol

assure that some people know how
to read a newspaper With a degree
of 'understanding. how to give
change without the help of a
machine and more importantly
that some people gain a sense of
the intellectual and cultural
riches around them. All these are
necessary contributions to a
culture preoccupied with measur-
ing power and success in terms of
dollars and cents.

it is no news to anyone to hear
about the relative paucity of funds
allocated toward education. A
twenty—one year old college stu-
dent signs a contract for $38
million just to play iootball. while
professors receive a tiny fraction
of that to educate and shape the
minds of our youth. Such an ine-
quity indicates that the existing
system oi values are warped at
best,

The value society places on the
assurance or a decent system oi
education for our youth is
minimal And still parents wonder

School seniors who can't even
read an eighth grade text book.

Unfortunately, this attitude has
and will affect the decision of
those in the academic realm. No
longer do the best and brightest
immediately head for graduate
school and a teaching career; in»
stead many opt for the boardroom
rather than the classroom. in dos
ing so. they assure themselves of
a more lucrative income. yet at
the Same time they Contribute to
the ever increasing mediocrity in
the intellectural timbre of the
country; a mediocrity that will
eventually catch up with our
society.

But, can you fault the individual
who decides to “sellrout” so he
can have a nice house and a de»
cent car and an orthodontist for
his kid? Not really. rather you
should fault the society that even
makes such a choice necessary,

We must eliminate the
discrepency betwen the value oi
the contribution an educator
makes to society and the amount
he receives for his work. Until
then we risk sinking into a
dangerous mediocrity as the

shes while the benefits of the non-
academic arena grow brighter in

Curbing

media

abuses

by John Sharbaro

Let's hear it for the_ U.S.
Supreme Court, who two
Tuesdays ago, made it much
easier to bring libel suits against
nationally distributed publica
tions. By allowing an injured parr
iy to try its case in the state of its
choice. this move improva the
chances for a successful libel
case, Hopefully this is just the
first step in a trend to curtail the
present abuse of the First Amend»
ment by the U.S. Press Corps.

By no means can one expect a
totally unbiased system oi repor-
ting. Humans, by their very
nature, hold preconceived opir
nions that even the most responsir
ble or reporters would have pro-
blems curtailing. However, it ap-
pears as ihougi-i most reporters
travel the world with their
preconceived notions readily
catalogued and primed for use.

The Supreme Court's action is
both necessary and overdue. The
press is a powerful tool and there
is no question that it can be very
dangerous when biased, sensa-
tionalized stories get ted to the
public. In a nation which holds
personal responsibility in such
high esteem, an irresponsible
reporter can be more dangerous
than an unleashed rabid dog Both
are indiscriminate in their choice
of victim, as well as oblivious to
the side effects of their actions.

Take the recent example oi the
Massachusetts Bar Room rape
case. it you only read newspaper
reports or the rape. you would
form a strange conception of what
Massachusetts’ citizens consider
a spectator sport. and yet in the
court records the only mention oi
any spectators was of a drunk in a
far-off corner.

Colorado provides another good
example. Governor Dick Lamm
mentioned that it was the duty oi a
terminally ill patient to reiuse a
liie support system. in order to
save the limited resources of both
State and family on what many
consider futile battles By the
time this Speech hit the Denver
papers. however. Lamm was askr
ing all people over the age of 60,
who were not productive
members oi society, to roll over,
die. and make room for the “up
and coming” generation.

We even find such careless
reporting in our own school paper.
The recent piece on Georgia
Dentel. by Daniel Klatz, serves as
a good case in point. Fortunately
most Grinnellians. unlike most
Americans, had the time and
resources to investigate the truth
oi this story.

With a medium which has such
a profound influence on America
opinion, responsibility is a must.
When a reporter, or staff, fails t-
exercise this responsibility, ther
must be other avenues alon
which it can be upheld. Unfor
tunately this action is sometime
retroactive, as in the case 0
lawsuits I see no solution in th
near future, but for now the actio
or the us, Supreme Court is to b
applauded.
