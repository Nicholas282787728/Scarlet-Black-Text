1971 Soccer Season Begins

The Grinnell soccer team
had the first workout of its
second season as a varsity
sport this week. The team
looks forward to a good sea
son; the first game is aginst
Central College in Fella on
September 18. The first con*
ference game is September
25th, when the Pioneers will
face Knox College at home.
Captain Tom Lincoln will
lead the team this year, as
it tries to better last year's
3-44 record. Other veteran
returnees include Steve Kort
stad, Roger Kumler, John Vi-
detich, Levi Wood, Tony
Wheeler, Jack Couch, Mark
Siegfried, and Larry Golds
stein.

Twelve freshmen appeared
at the first workout Monday,
swelling the ranks of the team
[0 21.

The team will miss the sere
vices of Bruce Graham, pro-
bably the best player last
season, and Dave Coron, the
goalkeeper. Others who will

be missed include J. C. La‘
bowitz, Jim Dix, Craig Gor-
don and Steve Hirshon. H11"
shon is out for the season
due to injuries; the others
graduated.

Coach of the Grinnell team
is Professor Keith Fisher,
appointed to the chemistry
staff last year. Fisher has
played semi- professional
soccer in England with the
Birmingham Works team, so
he is well suited to his role
as head coach.

Fisher is in the process of
finding a good goalkeeper to
fill the vacated spot, and
urged any students interested
in the spot to turn out for
practice. So get on the ball,
you budding soccer enthu-
siasts, and come to the next
practice.

A full practice game is sche»
duled for this Saturday after"
noon at 2:00 p.m. on the 10th
Avenue field. Come out and
support the Soccer team this
fall.

ded.

Programming will be more
ﬂexible this year, with three
hour slots replacing former
shorter ones. .These slots will
many times be joint efforts,
with two or more DJ's on
at once. The DJ's will not
have regular slots, but will
come on at different times
and different days ofthe weck.
Beth Bill and Clayton hope
KDIC will serve more of an
informational function, with
greater emphasis on what is
happening in the outside world.
More broadcasts of tapes of
live events art» planned, along
with the rebroadcast of past
events such as concerts and
speeches at Grinnell.

to get students to work," and
4) "that the college needs
some indication of student
progress". He did not dis
cuss the credit/fail option ex-
cept to note that it had some
problems. He eneded by sta~
ting, "I look forward to a
year in which all of us shall
engage in thoughtful assess-
ment of the educational ex-
perience offered by Grinnell,
an assessment carried out for
the purpose of improving that
experience."

Miss Floyd noted that there
are certain things that “just
don’t fire up" this generation
of college students. ”
There are a few things of wh—
ich we are sure. We are
here at Grinnell, and we are
getting a liberal arts educa'
tion". The primary goal for
the next year, she feels, is
to define exactly what a lit:—
eral arts educationmeans. a-
mong other points, she noted
that, “We should consider
whether career training in
other areas shouldbe provided
or whether there are other
flaids for which a Grinnell
B.A. would be useful.” She
suggested that teachers from
outside the academic commur
nity might be brought to the
campus, and that a three year
degree program, stressing a
program of continuing educa
tion for alumni, shouldbe con-
sidered.

She reiterated the points al—
ready made by Clotfeltcr on
the grading system, and sug-
gested that programs could be
devised, if the interest exists

She also asked the commun-
ity to ”closely examine the
residence hall program". She
raised many issues about the
present dorm system, among
them: Do the dorms promote
mutual respect? Is there a
beneficial relationship be-
tween a student's academic
performance and his resi-
dence hall experience? Are
the halls cultural wastelands?
She felt that these and many
other questions must be con-
sidered before an accurate ev-
aluation could be made. She
noted that students "have an
understandable..fear of cum~
bersome bureaucracy and red
tape. . .but. . .we must have a
way to pool our resources
and to divide the labor...if
we are to have a way of de’
termining what our collective
thoughts are."

Shelly also called for more
parties on the campus in the
coming year.
