ﬁrst Saturday in_May as the date
for the dual meet. Grinnell very
justly refused this,as Easter vaca-
tion came so late that shc would
have barely two weeks in which
to train, and demanded a week
later. Iowa refused to Change her
position in spite of the fact that it
is traditional to hold the dual on
the second Saturday in May.
Therejwas no dual in consequence
This year Grinnell was intotined
that the second Saturday in May,

’ the loth, belonged to Minnesota.

As Easter vacation comes just a
week earlier this year. Gl‘ll\|lCll
submitted May 3d as The date [or
the dual, but Iowa refused to ace
cept it,statlng that her track team
captain did not wish to hold more
than one dual rncct duiing the
season. This is the situation
exactly as it stands at present.

THE Y. M. c. A. ENTERTAINMENT.

The beneﬁt of the Y. M, C, A,
Saturday evening in the chapel
building was well attended. At
the exercise in the chapel it was
estimated that two hundred and
titty people were present and they
thoroughly enjoyed a line pro-
gram.

Miss Holden’s readings, and
Miss Bray’s and Mr. Heighton‘s
musical productions were of a very
high quality. Atter the program
nearly the whole audience went to
the society halls and enjoyed a
social time. The object of the
Association in giving an evening

3 otsocial pleasure was successfully

well received and
which were on sale added to the
evening’s entertainment which
was also increased by iiunlheis by
the mandolin club and by the stu
dent hand. The band alone w 5
worth tar more titan the price of

 

admission to the evening's pro
gram.

Financially, the evening was
successful, though the full amount
hoped tor was not raised. Ale
though the audience was large.
expenses reduced the net amount
cleared to about sixty dollals.
This sum will he ct great help in
reducing: the obligations of the
Association. and the members feel
that on the whole the ends which
were desired were gainer! by this
plan.

PUPILS’ REclTAL.

The recital by the pupils or Prof.
Olds last night was enjoyed by
about a hundred people. This is
the ﬁrst recital that has been given
by this department and so it is llll'
possible to compare it nitll :inyr
thing which can he used as a mi-
terion. it can be said, however.
that Mr. Olds has some very prom-
ising pupils; some who will be
heard ct later it they keep tip their
interest and WOl‘lC,‘ If Mr. Olds
were better supported in this de
partment by the students of the
college, as he should be, these re-
citals would come more frequent-
ly. The program last night was
as follows:
