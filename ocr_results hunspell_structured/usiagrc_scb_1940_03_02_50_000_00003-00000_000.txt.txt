The

cornfield shortly

SCALPED before the Kelly
Kantor, annual Rawson fall house
party. ,

The trouble all began back a-
bout November 24ishortly after
Rand gym wasn’t. At that time,
L. v. Phelps, college treasurer,
received a bill from Weber, aske
ing for $50 in return for an un-
known quantity of corn stalks and
sorghum which had disappeared
from his place shortly before the
Kantor, Phelps referred me bill
to Dean Shelton L. Beatty, who in
turn thrust it before the Rawson
house council.
nawson Contacts Weber.

Rawson, gentlemen that they
are, immediately contacted Weber
and tried to effect a mediation.
According to Arleigh Holstad, hall
president, attempts were made to
mediate the cost, or else repay
the corn in more corn or in hay.

”We even offered to put it up
before a disinterested board to de-'
cide on a just payment, but he
refused to negotiate,” Holstad
claimed.

Legal Minds Consulted.

1n the course of time, Weber,
it is claimed by Rawson officials,
had cut the value of the stalks
to 335 but the generous offe; was
hastily removed, and the value
again placed at $50.

On consultation with officers
of the law, px'erlaw students and
lawyers about town, the Rawson»
ites learned that they were legal-
ly in the wrong, on uncertain
counts ranging from a mlSdEmean-'
or to a felony; for the dormitory
interpretation of “borrow" is a
trifle "too liberal" for law in
Iowa.

Report/er Bogs Down.

An intrepid Scarlet and Black
reporter ventured out to the We-
ber homestead late last night on

Telephone Spree Started.

Taking a liberal bint, another
telephone call (long-distance) was
made, this time to the sheriff’s
office in Montezuma. The sheriff
wasn’t there. but a lady tending
J'Zul was. All she would say was,
“Call William Welsh, deputy shore

Some know-it-all on the Scarlet

$50 Changes Hands.

Summing up the situation, Raw-
son is out $50,, Weber is in 550,
the local courts are apparently
still free from any legal battles
between college men, and the far-
mers of Poweshiek County, and
Rawson’s spring formal may take
the form of a benefit featuring
the music of a rented nickelodian.
