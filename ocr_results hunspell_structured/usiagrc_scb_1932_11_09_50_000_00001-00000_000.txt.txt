After having a week's layoff the
Pioneers will swing into action again
Friday afternoon on Ward field in
their homecoming game against
Creighton university of Omaha, and
will be defending their four year rec-
ord of victories on their home field.
This game will he the last game of
the season for Grinnell on their home

field. .
Creighton Considered strong
The Omaha aggregation is one of
the strongestthat that school has put
out in several years, already having
two conference wins to their credit,
Lie-st week they subdued the Wash-
ington university of St, Louis 40 to 0.
St. Louis defeated Crinncll 12 to 6.

Captain Dick Sklenar, brawny tac-
kle for the Bluejays, is considered one
of the best men in the Missouri val-
ley conference, Ed Jelen, quarter-
back, has been doing most of the of»
fensive work for the Creighton eleven
this season, and is especially capable
at passing, and carrying the ball in
an open field. ‘

Although the camparative scores

' give Omaha the odds to win the [us—
sle. the Pioneers have been working
strenuously during the past
weeks in preparation for the game.
Despite the inclement weather, Coach
Watt has been scrimmaging his squad
nearly every night, and has given
them severe fundamental workouts.

James Back in Game

Clarence ”Snap" James, who has
not been playing steadily for several
weeks is scheduled to start the game,
and it is expected that a difference
will be noticed in the famous Crin-
neu pass attack,

Men in Good Condition

All of the men on the squad are in
good condition, and will be expecting
a tough battle. Creighton will have
an undisputed claim on second place
in the conference if they are victor-

ions in Friday's game and if the Pin--

neers win and then can defeat the
Oklahoma eleven on the following
week, they will have claim to first
place.

The game will start at 2:30 p. m.
and tickets will be sold at the gate.

Forensic Group

New Members

As a result of the final tryouts held
some time ago, 11 new men will he

night at 7: 5.

The successful new members in—
clude two juniors, Hugh Wyckoff and

“Ring up the curtain ' It is re-
hearsal night for the actors in the
homecoming play, "Ten Nights in 21
Bar Room," which will be given
Thursday and Saturday nights of
this week in the high school auditor-
ium. Chattering confusion hurriedly
dies down as Mrs, Sara Sherman
Pryor, drama department head, gives
the command,

"Where is that actor? Where IS
he?" Mrs. Pryor cries out excitedly.
The curtain has gone up, the stage
is set for action, but no actor appears.
A tragic hush descends on the little
group of onlookers. Drama has al-
ready begun. Suddenly the suspense
is broken, as Chris Rhynsberger leans
from the wing to stagewhispcr, “He
can't come~he hasn’t got his pants
on yet!"

“Father, or father, come home

pleads, cntreats, and weeps. What

‘ Most of the representative men's

The project was originated a few
iweeks ago by the Young Men's Chrii‘e

'need on the Grinnell campus for fa-

recreations and entertainment for all
students throughout the year, espeCr

The proposed building would be
completely remodeled with a new
skylight, hardwood floors and finish—
ed walls. When complete it would be
equipped wrth tennis and handball
courts, pool tables, ping pong tables.
and adequate space for dancing.

If the plan should work out success-
fully another floor might be added at
a later date which would be made in~

letic, debating, and other teams which
meet Grinnell in various contests
throughout the year.

Extra Vacation
at Thanksgiving

That the Friday following Thanks-
giving will not he a holiday was de-
cided definitely by the Student Coun—
cil at a meeting Sunday afternoon, at
2:30 in the south parlors of the quad
ranglc,

The reasons for the dccision are
that the student body had a Victory
day without cuts, that it is only three
more weeks until Christmas vacation,
that it has been necessary to cone
‘denm the school calendar for ewe
‘noml'n reasons and the North Central

 

association requirements will not pep
mit another holiday, and finally that
such a holiday would seriously impede
‘the preparation for the all college
