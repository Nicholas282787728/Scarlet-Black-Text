Warning: Gad hates queers, says Pat; war coming

WAKE-UP
' CALL
by Christopher Fletcher

Happy Coming Out Day, gay
friends and others interested in indi-
vidual liberty in this country, but be
cautious that we not allow ourselves
to feel too comfortable and happy:
we are at war.

We have a declaration from a
powerful enemy that we have not yet
answered withsufficientscriousness.
I think some Grinnellians feel a little
toosaferightnow, lnless safeplaces,
your brethren are dying in violence
as I Wiite this. In other states, efforts
are being made to legislate away cer-
tain people’s citizenship.

This fall, Pat Robertson and his
Christian Coalition arehostingahuge
convention. The subject: how to
defeat the gay rights agenda. The
Coalition is a very powerful and very
rich entity which hides from the IRS
in a bogus tax shelter and now con-
trols the Republican party from
within. You know Pat Robertson.
He is the most dangerous man in
America. Whiie‘his stated objec7
tives prove that he is nnti»freedom,
anti-Constitution. and even anti-
Christian, he couches his rhetoric in
the language of patriotism, family
and even “conservatism." He and his
ilk have promised make the issue of
civilliberties forgays the90‘sequiva-
lent of the abortion issue.

Each year. in a nationally em-
barrassingshow,yourpresidentkowr
tows before the annual convention of
religious broadcasters, a group of
robbers who have dubbed themselves
“God’sairforce.” He places his party
at the disposal of a glass and phos-
phorus electric god. The criminal
stupidity of a president pandering to
this fringe sect is becoming more
clear every day.

The man for whom 40 percent of

’ gay America voted in 1988, the in—

, cumbent Party of God president
George Herbert Hoover Bush, by not

, being 'a leader by not holding con-
victions, by not fulfilling his sole
emnly sworn presidential oath to pro»
tect and uphold the Constitution of
the United States. has through inacr
lion. apathy and an almost criminal
negligence, virtually delivered his
party and the fabric ofour nation into
the hands ofa group of people com-
mitted to the destruction of certain
groups of Americans based on how
they live their lives.

So that we all understand the
temis,lctmcclarifyacoupleofthings
about tlte religious right: they are
skilled liars and nothing less than
traitors. They are liars in that they
misrepresentourhistoryand nation’s
founders’ ideals. They have tried to
pass off the early Republic as some
kind of experiment in a thcocracy
based on “Judeao-Christian values”
(read: contemporary moral
majoritarian statism). They identify

themselves with conservatives, when
in factaroal conservative would never
supportan agenda thatcalls forlegis»
lating morality and bringing govem-
mentintopeople'sprivalelives. They
can be considered traitors against the
American people and state because
they seek to replace ourRepublic and
its Constitution with a different kind
of system without the consent of the
people and without following legal
procedures. If you think I overstate
their ambition, I suggest you look
more closely at the law. It is not
possible to establish a “Christian.“
moral majoritarian state in this coun-
try without violating the ConstituV
tion. ‘
They attempt to kill our national
ideals and discard our laws while
professingto uphold the“traditional"
values of America, while professing
to be patriots and good Christians.
How much money. Mr. Robertson,
does God need to save our souls?
How much power do you need’.7
For no good reason. the relir
giaus right seeks to strip certain
American citizen: of their rights.
Some more laid-back readers, always
trying to be objective, might say to
me, “But Christopher, you are so
nasty to the God folk. You seem to
hate them as much as they hate you.
Aren‘t you employing a double stanv
dard of some sort, or a slippery slope
argument, or a....” But there is a
huge, all-important, undeniable, overr
riding, gigantic difference between
between my regard for them and

Sanchez

by Erik Sanning

I hate to bring up this issue once
again, but people seem» to be.
missingsome important facts relatr
ingtaninoSanchez'dismissal,and
as not onlyan alumnus. but also as a
staff member of Grinnell College, I
think somethings need to be said.

First, Mr. Sanchez was NOT a
student. He was an employee of the
College. As an employer, Grinncll
College does not have to retain an
employee who was harassing stu—
dents and using drugs in a manner
which affected his work. He was
hired, in part, to live in College housA
ing so that he would have a higher
degreeofcontactwithstudents. Why
would the College continue to pay
Sanchcv to il\’C with students when a
significant number of them were ha-
rassed and intimidated by him'.7 Ob-
viously, he was not properly hone
tiling that part of hiSJOb.

A person over the age of 21 in
this country is allowed to engage in
all the brain-numbing debauchery
involving alcohol that he/she wants
to. This was not the reason for his
dismissal. The reasons are much
more serious thanthat, so much so
that all of those involve-xi have re-
fused locomment.l-lopcfully,thestu-
dent body realizes that a staff mem—

their's for me and other people who
don’t hold their views sacred. This is
it: They attack us. Unprovoked, they
assault us on TV, in the street and at
the ballot box. They are making a
concerted effort to control my free
speech and my private life through
legislation and intimidation. I and
people like me have done homing to
them. It is true that I despise their
insane TV religion, but never have I
tried to have it banned and I could
never even conceive of making a
huge effort to take away another
group‘s rights. I have been told that
if I do not believe as they do, then I
am not an American. Who is not an
American? I would like Robertson
and Republican National Chairman
Rich Bond to please explain to me
again what one has to do to be an
American. I don‘t think I ever re-
ceived my copy of the application. I
don‘t remember ever voting on it.

In short, I have a right to defend
myself, and ifthc divisiveness in this
country gets to such a terrible crisis
point, then I will do it in arms if
necessary.

Setting aside America and its
laws (because those are considered
irrelevant to these zealots), we find
that even the Christian scriptures do
not support their agenda. Robertson
and his flock hate and judge and act
as God on Earth for living people.
Their Bible forbids them this mad~
ness. How dare they misrepresent
the Christian ethic in this way? If]
am going to hell for a bisexual per-

version, then I expect that I will see
dear Pat down there as well, bunting
forever for being an anti-Christ (I
hope that I can get an administrative
post down there or hell is going tobe
unbearable—spare me the com»
pant!)

Stripped of law, tradition. his-
tory and even the Bibleas support for
their dangerous, arcane political
agenda, the religious right has no
ground on which to stand. Butdo the
TVrstunned masses understand lhis’.7
I doubt it. We might. be defeated by
an illusion, maintained by the igno-
rance and complacency of the people
around us, and gay people will only
be one set of their victims.

As the language I have used in
this column may have indicated, this
newly energetic attack on people
based on with whom they have sex is
not just an issue for non-straight
people. Hetersexuals would be de»
luded themselves if they thought for
a moment that this issue does not
affect them. We are are not talking
about ”priveleges" for a group of
people ( as some “conservatives"
would tell us). We are talking about
civil libertierfor American citizen:
and human rights. If we ever allow
the state (or any social radical power
bloc like the religious right) to legis-
late how we may have sex, then we
will be surrendering our mostprivate
and personal domain to the state only
to satisfy a fanatical fringe‘s delu»
sions aboutwhot constitutes the com-
mon good.

If you are a rmoning person
hwo believes in the primacy of indi-
vidual rights and fair government,
then you must considerthis siuiation
about which I write to be intolerable.
If you don’t care at all, then you are
being stupid and doing damage to the
nation. Please wake up.

To move way from the doom
and gloom for a moment, I have to
say that lreally believe that theclock
will not be turned back, and that
those of who hold sacred individual
liberty will prevail eventually. But]
am fearful over how bloody and dif-
ﬁcult the rest ofthe light will be. We
can make a big difference right this
year with very little effort: Vote
intelligently. Aclue: amajorRepubr
lican win in the White House and
Congress will strengthen the party‘s
hand, and hencethe hand of the Chris-
tian Coalition and other Republican
radicals. Moderate Republicans will
have an even more difficult time tak-
ing back their party. Lfyou are not a
Republican-leaning voter. then vote
without fail. If you are an intelligent
conservative, then desert your party
this year for is long term good. Vote
Libenarian or Natural Law if you
can’t vote Democrat. but do not vote
for the TV God. He doesn‘t make
ballot requirements in any state.

If you are “coming out" this
weekend, then good for you. Have
fun at the party tomorrow night, but
be thinking about a Monday mobili-
zation for war. We can’ t afford to
lose this one.

affair. Sanning responds

ber is not dismissedfor merely drink»
ing alcohol. Since he is nolastudent,
Sanchez does not have the rights and
privileges of students, i.e., the Col—
legedoes nothave to granthrm a trial.
This is NOT a ‘basic human right’;
thisisbusiness. Ifanemployeeisnot
performinghis/herdutiesadcquately,
the employer has sufficient cause to
fire that person, The College did not
refuse to grantSanchez ‘basic human
rights'. Why do you think they cone
tinue to refuse to comment on this
issue? They are protecting his right
to privacy. In addition, for harass
mcnt cases, the general student body
does not have a right to know the
details.

Ofthethreearuclesdeahngwith
this issue. not once has an attempt
been made to interview themost im-
portant people involved: ‘the bl’z’lL\'

house; I have. At the very least, It

about which Kambouroglou claims
Sanchez was informed "dc facto,”,
weremadewithoutSanchet because
he did notattend any ofthemeetings.
He himself knowingly and willfully
did not show up.

I don't understand; how did
Alcxandeernbouroglouexpectthe
studentbody, or any thinking person

on this campus, to receive the expla-y
nations he offered without asking
themselves some serious questions?
There is no human rights issue at
stake here, as was explained earlier.
The ‘circumstantial evidence’ was
by no means circumstantial. Fur»
themorc. he was not treated like a
criminal, but like the employee that
he was, guilty of some very serious
transgressions.

I also find fault with the way
Kambouroglou belittles the com-
plaints of, as he calls them. ‘imma»
ture spoiled kids’. lfheis saying that
everyone who has been harassed and
who files a complaint against that
person without them knowing is a
‘spoiled kid’, then he has a lot to
Icam. A lot. By putting down and
belittling these people,
Kambouroglou is adding to the ale
ready great pressure that ittakcs fora
harassment victim to come forward
and deal with his/her harasser. It is
painfullyobviousthatKambouroglou
has never been harassed himself.

Kambouroglou claims that the
French Department asked Sanchez
to rclum for a second year, This is
true. but misleading. Sanchez was
asked to return because their first

Sanchez was contracted for another

WFinally. I would like to pointout
howlightly Kambourogloudealswith
the fact that Sanchez refused to leave
a student's bedroom when asked to.
No oneshouldbemadetoputupwith
an unwanted visitor. Someone who
refuses to leave your bedroom is more
than just obnoxious. if the conditions
are right, that person is a direat. The
student body cannot be expected to
think that it is acceptable for anyone
toenterany room atany timeandstay
for as longas they want. When some-
one asks you to leave their bedroom,
it is more than merely courteous to
comply. lfyou do not, in this culture,
it is not Just a personal affront, but a
real reason to worry about your own
safety with thispcrson. Sanchez gave
that person serious reasons to be
afraid; afraid of not only extreme
verbal abuse, but also physibal'abuse.
