FAIR WARNING

Although Pres. John S. Nolleu’s addrc scs this
week to mass meetings of college men and omen
were given in 2i friendly, informal manner, with-
out direct accusations or allegations. it does not
take Superhuman intelligence to realize that cur-
rent conditions in the college must have prompted
them.

We believe that the informal talk to men Stile
dcuts would have been more cffcotivc hfld Presi-
dent Nolleil stressed only his major warnings cons
cerning drinking, tliievery and gambling, instead
of including remarks about ”necking”, cigai-ct
smoking and hullrscssions. While we are not argu-
ing for or against the advisability of these lﬂtiPl'
“vices”, we believe that in a scllool which is govr
criled by a student-body organization these smaller
matters are entirely up to the dis ctiou of the
student governors.

In President Nollen’s talk to the women st
dents, according to our information. drinking. (ii
obediilnce ill regard to “hours” regulations, alld
hitch-hiking were condemned. Any other remarks
concerning wearing apparel or personal appear-
ances of coeds here were, in ollr opinion, out of
place.

Our feeling ill regard to the 0 addresses is that.
ill so far as they concerned drinking, thievery and
gambling among the men, and drinking, hitch-hik-
ing, and disobeying regulations among the women.
they were very fili warnings, entirely within the
jurisdiction of Pr idcnt Nollen and the facility,
and given with a spirit of cooperation Hereafter,
students who trailsgress iii these respec ' will not,
be able to offer the excuse that they were not
warned and “did not realize the seriousness of
their offense.”

READING COMFORT

It is often repeated that students should pass
more of their Valuable lime in the library. “'itlloul
doubt the Grinllcll college library is olic of the fillr
Izst in the state. The central library ill the city of
O 'ilm with it»- 2Hi000 residents does not equal
our own literary Storehouse for wealth of comprc-
licusivc material at hand.

' A little more than 700 academic minds have
at their disposal a finer institution than has been
granted to more 111”] 200,000 citizens of anothcr
community aild still most of those seven hundred
must be led to it by way of assignments and po-
tcrnul advice.

A suggested remedy of this situation and one
that promises to greatly stimulate student interest
in the contents of our library, we fccl, should no
longer go without proper recognition. The creator
of the idea says, “Why not invest furnishings that
can no longer stand up under dormitory punish-
ment in a comfortable reading room ill the library?
Perhaps the basement newspaper room could be
readily converted into such a desired place.”

Having witnessed the popularity of the Arthur
Upson room in inucsota university’s central li-
brary, we are inclined to bclicvc that the advocates
of a similar place here have hit upon ii really
worthwhile idea.

WHAT IS THE TRUE FEELING?

Now that the first semester’s work is finished
there arises once more tllc question of whether or
not students shollld be allowed to know their actual
grades.

The present system of making general classifi~
cations came about as a result of student and facul~
ty cooperation two years ago, in an effort to dcs
troy the rivalry and competition among students
over grades. Too much emphasis was placed by tllc
students on the relative significance of their work.
and it was often felt that distinction bcwccn one
student’s work and that of another was too finely
drawn. 6

But since the passing of that new ruling, there
has been a resentment on the part of Student. who
am earnestly interested in how well or how poorly
they are doing in their courses. Recently some
modification of the present system was recommend
ed to the faculty committee

The Scarlet and Block urges that students and

faculty cooperate in this matter, rather than dis-
cussing it in groups by themselves. 'iiy not have
all all-college convocation. or all open forum of
some sort to bring to light the true feeling?

This editorial makes no attempt, to argue the
casc. Tho plan has succeeded ill its avowcd purpose,
but ill an iutciwicw, one of the most ardent advo-
cates of the system admitted that there should be
no objection to telling ii student his grade after the
sclilcster’s work has been completed. This same
faculty member added, however, that since the
present ruling forbids such a thing, the statute
should bc strictly enforced,

Obviously, then, there are grounds for dis-
cussion. Some lilodificatiou appcnrs to be (i blc,
and since the one . ill of the new rule has been
successfully cal led out. it is not. likely to return
lmlcss ii complete row on to the old siltent is
adopted.

The Scarlet and Black will be glad to receive
communications on this subject from faculty mem-
bers and students alike. Start the ball rolling by
attacking the question in a spirit of coopuratiou.

A PROBLEM

A new semester in the midst oi“ this dcpr
period l 5 made it very apparent that Gt
college i. not able to supply work to all the stu-
dcilts needing it.

Taking for granted the fact that many of the
students require assistance of chic kind. we would
suggest that, were a student given only ll scholar-
ship or only it job, there would be little llt‘lll for
more men and women needing it.

Ill the granting; of citllm- of those aids llol
ship is without a doubt a very important consid-
eration. The brilliant studi‘iit will not till" tn ii
running start ill the business world and bling d.
tinctlon to his alilla liiatc llnivcvor. the majority
of the people in the world arc the slow, steady
workers who were the fair to good students ill
college.

It has been argued among the student body.

lolild the bot 'd be lowvrod, there would be

light; should the board be loll'oi'cd. there
would be fewer students requiring the WM .

Other Opinions

IT’S GOOD PUBLICITY, BUT—
(Tlie Creightonian)

Another smashing success for a university publicity
agent! This month a university will inaugurate a course
in marriage, stressing the “physical, psychological, cCOr
nomic, social and religious aspects of wedded life," ac-
cording to a statement in the Literary Digest.

if our knowledge of human nature is anything near
accurate, a great many will register for the course, not
because they believe that it will help them to he happily
married, but because they are eagerly looking for infor-
mation on a few points hinted at in the outline of [so
tures.

It is interesting to note that the instructor at the
head is a person who has been married twice himself.
Surely he will have a great deal to say in the matter of
selecting a mate with whom to be happily married ”un-
til death do us part."

Somehow, there seems to be something missing from
the series of lectures which the college proposes to give
its students. There is an atmosphere created which
causes each party to marriage to ask himself or herself,
“What am I going to get out of it?” if both man and
woman are going to be trained to look upon marriage in
that light, Butler university is not going to lower the
divorce rate as they plan, but will raise it instead.

As it can be imagined, a university professing no
control by any religious denomination, also shows no
consideration of a Supreme Being in the teaching of
courses which by their very nature are concemed with
the spiritual, Butler university can get a lot of publicity
and may make a lot of money, but they can never lower
the divorce rate by teaching the material in place of the
spiritual.

WHEN MARRIAGE FAlLS
(The College Eye)

“When no out of every 100 marriages in Indian-
apolis have to be annulled, something is wrong with
marriage," thinks Dean Albert E. Bailey, or the exten-
Sion division at Butler university, indianapolis. 50 But—
ler is going to have a course in marriage.

The new course in matrimonial relations aims to
seek out the causes of marital unhappiness, so that those
who enter into matrimony may do so intelligently and
those already married may know the way to happiness
and a successful marriage.

Butler university is pioneering in an open field, one
that has been crying for alleviation for years. (Do you
know any young married couples who are happy all the
time?)

From this study should come a finer understanding
of marriage and a determination on the part of those
who take it to give all their knowledge to a successful
eonsumation of this present-day problem.

Dean Bailey llsLs ignorance and selfishness as the
root causes of all the trouble. “A conspiracy of silence
on the part of those who know, coupled with social to.»
boos on the part of those who would like to know, have
left the dissemination of knowledge to the incompetent."
Next in importance he places psychological aspects, the
adjustment of personalities to one another.

Adding happiness to marriage will be a blessing to B
humanity, for if we only could see within the hearts of
people, we probably would come to believe that marriage
ranks with disease in causing suffering among the peo-
ple of the earth.
