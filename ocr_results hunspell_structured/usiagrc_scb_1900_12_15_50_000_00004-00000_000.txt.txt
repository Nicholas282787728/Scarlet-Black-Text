Drake's New Gym.

At the meeting oi the Drake
Athletic board last Wednesday it
was decided to raise funds for the
erection of a new gymnasium to
Cost about 525,000. During the
past, the basement ot the science
hall has been used, with which
state of affairs every 01d Grinnell
man can sympathize. It wasalso
decided to erect a training shed,
immediately, at a cost of about
$5.000. for use while donations
are being secured through active
solicitation, and until the new
Gym. is a fact instead of an ideal
construction. The $5,000 will al»
so be raised by subscription.
Grinnell extends congratulations
and hopes the proposed building
will soon be a reality.

The Lewis Lits. Entertain To-
night.

The Lewis Literary society will
entertain the E. B. B.’s in Insti»
tute hall this evening at eight
o'clock, This will be the second
joint meeting between the two so-
cieties this term, the ladies having

 

entertained the gentlemen the ﬁrst

part of the tall. The meeting will
be a very informal affair, and the
chief object of everyone will be to
have a general good time. Intel's
mingled with the valious games
provided,\villbe other amusements
to assist the pleasureseekcrs in
whiting away the time. To make
the occasion complete, the gentle-
men have provided a sumptuous
repast of oysters, wafers, bon bons.
cocoa and many tempting dainties.
Whether or not the boys will do
the cooking we do not know,th
it is safe to say that it they carry
out their well-laid plans, the ladies
will be royally entertained.

Liquid Air.

The second number of the lec—
ture course proved equally as ens
tertaining and instructive as the
ﬁrst, and a large and appreciative
audience turned out to attest its
popularity. Liquidairisanarlicle
which comparatively few people
have seen, and Prof. J. Ernest
Woodland had the undivided at-
tention of his hearers from the
time he appeared before them
until the last drop of liquid air
had sizzled away into the atmos~
phere. Frof.Woodlandintroduced
his experiments with a short talk
on new discoveries in the scientiﬁc
world and those pertaining to his
subject in particular. Then he

with which it comes in contact.
The air itself, murky and ﬂaky,
steamed with a boiling or trying
sound whenever it was poured up-
on other objects, which of course
were always of a higher degree of
temperature, not even excepting
ice. Objects upon which it had
acted were passed around through
the audience so that all might
examine, if they wished. Prof.
Woodland’s manner of presenting
his experiments won him the favor
of all and it was a lecture which
one was notanxious to see come
to a close.
