DECISION DEBATES NEEDED

At controversy has long raged in intercollegiate
debati'rlg circles over the question of debate de-
eiSioils. Three types of debates are generally recoge
nize‘d' as critic judge decision debates, alldiclice
decision debates, and lib-decision debates. In debat-
ing at Grinnell the noedceision practice has been
followed the last few years more out 'of the ﬁnan-
cial necessity of doing away witll paid judges than
because it 'as ally considered the best system.

on type of debate has two lnaill
draw-backs, One in that it is not so stimulating
to either the debaters or the audience as is the (lee
eision type of debate. No one likes a contest that
ends in a draw, and the noedecision debate docs
practically that. NO-(leClSlOll debates for tli reason
do not have the drawing power that dee ion dc-
bates have. The lack of the spur of competition and
the larger crowds that are both present ill the de-
cision type of debate react unfavorably on the de-
baters ill the liordecision type, so that they do ilot
debate as well nor prepare as well for the occasion.

The audience decisioli type of debate is manie
festly unfair, for the hometown team invariably
Wills whether or no. and the man who really would
like to give ‘an honest vote cannot because of the
loyalty he bears his own team.

The critic judge decision, however. adds ma.
terially to the debate from the standpoint of both
the debater and the audience. The debater is en-
couraged to prepare iiiorc thoroughly for and dc-
liver more skillfully a debate that he knows will
be carefully judged by and compared with the
work of his opponents. The debater is often able,
too, to derive a, great deal of help in perfecting
his debating from the criticisms of the judges. The
large crowds at. decision debates, stimulate the
debatei- to do his best.

The audience, on the other hand, feels much
more pleased with a contest that ends with a de-
cision, with one side or the other declared the vic-
tor, than it does with a battle of wits and oratory
that merely stops weakly without any fitting clie
max in the form of a decision. The audience also
gets a great deal of understanding of the question
debated and the arguments presented if they are
reviewed and cr ised by the judge. Often times
this formal Cl‘l icism is dispensed with, but even
then the audience is much better pleased with the
decision debate.

The advantages of the critic judge decision
type of debating show it to be so far superior to
the other forms with their many disadvantages that
certainly the ﬁnancial obstacle can be overcome.
Many able judge. can be found wllosc services may
be had for the asking. Critic judge decisions should
be again adopted in the best interests of debating
at Grinllcll.

WEEKLY PERSONNEL PARAGRAPH

Today The Scarlet and Black prints the ﬁrst
of a seri - of weekly articles written by Mitchell
Drecse, director of, personnel at Grilmcll college.
The paragraphs will appear ill box form at the
bottom of column ﬁve on the front page of the
Saturday editions of the paper.

The innovation ill The Scarlet and Black is
in cffcet with several college newspapers which are
on the exchange list of the Grinncll publication.
A “personnel corner” is a regular feature on page
four of the Geo College Cosmos, weekly newspaper
of Goo college, Cedar Rapids. The Scarlet and Black
has been copied by many college publications this
year ill makeup, type, and arrangement of stori ',
and today it is happy to adopt the project of other
papers’ and announce that Mr. Dreesc will con-
tribute a weekly ”paragraph.”

It is especially timely for such an idea to be
used by The Scarlet and Black. With the advent of
1931 and the gradual resumption of business to
normalcy, college seniors realize more the scarcity
of vacancies in June, and the “weekly summary”
by Mr. Drcese of any Change in the unemployment

situation during the preceding seven days should
be a “Grinnell thermometer” of the prospects for
positions after graduation.

OPTIMISM IN DEPRESSION

James A. Farrell, president of the United States
Steel corporation, iii the current issue of the R0-
tariali, lnnnthly publication of Rota v Internatiaiie
a], asks the American public to “quit. harping upon
depression, aiid to talk better times."

During the last year the United States has
faced a general business depression. This ms but
a logical outcome following the activity of 1929.
Production ill nearly all indusil‘ics has declined
materially, but some like to think that business
has bccll making for better times; this in view of
the wider demand for manufactured alticlcs of
higher qualit,

The millions spent and being expended ill
modernizing plants to reduce costs will be justiﬁed
by the inevitable return of a period when demand
will again cvcrtakc supply.

lVllilc competition ill industry may be termed
the “life of trade,” Mr. Farrell believes it must
be healthy competition, because carried to the ex-
cess which leads to destruction of competitors, it
is harmful to business and destructive of prospe .
ity. The middle ground must. be found iii legitie
mate cooperation combined with legitimate compe-
tition.

Business can never exist without a fair proﬁt.
When proﬁts disappear, business likewise dis-
appears. The satisfaction of labor working for radar
qliate wages, of the consuming public for an ade-
quate Suppl of goods at reasonable prices, of the
investor f a fair return on his money, of the
government for an ullilnpaircdl source of tax re-
turns, am all dependent upon proﬁtable operation
of busillc s.

Bu ’n management is ill duty bound to apply
scientiﬁc thinking and planning ill effecting hotter
methods for the stabilizing of business prosperity.

By cooperative effort economies have been ef-
fected through standardization, simpliﬁcation. and
the elimination of waste. Inefﬁcient plants and un-
fair selling methods are till a part of many iildusr
tries, but unfair and high-pressure sales efforts will
never offset the failings brought ab lit by plants
that are inefﬁcient. Changing conditions and ae-
ccleratcd methods are forcing the transition to
modernized plants and improved commercial prace
tices.

Advertisements advocating the ”buy new”
feature receive the following comment from llr.
Farrell:

“Public opinion cannot be artiﬁcially manu-
factured. Advertising and publicity alone, no mate
tcr how skillfully handled, will not achieve any
thing of lasting value unless founded upon sound
economic principles. Public conﬁdence can be maili-
tained only if actual achievement accompany alle
nounccinents and claims.”

As the years go by. appreciation of the ﬁller
relationships of business will increase, conﬁdence
ill each other will be broadened, fairness to all will
become second nature, and as a result industry will
improve it own condition by better serving the
public welfare. -

THE EDITORIAL PAGE
(From the [own Publisher)

if you want to ﬁnd out whether your editorial page
is being read. print an editorial that one or more of
your readers do not like. You will get an amazingly
prompt reaction.

That is the surest test of reader interest in the
editorial page. Some of the editors of Iowa weekly news-
papers have had demonstrations of this fact within the
last month. Some of their own reactions to stinging
letters from readers are printed elsewhere in this issue
of the Iowa Publisher.

It may be that the spineless editor, he who is overly
careful not to express an opinion that will he opposed by
any one of his numerous groups of readers, gets none
of these letters of commendation, or of protest. But he
who gets bouquets and bricltbats, peaches and rozzber-
ries, is the worthwhile editor, and it is he who is doing
the most for his readers. He may pin a rose upon his
own lapel and face the world with a smile, in the sure
knowledge that he and his newspaper are of some im-
portance to the world.

The fact that. some readers violently disagree with
what he has written is evidence‘that he has jarred them
loose from their mental inertia, and stimulated their
brain cells into action. He who can make his readers
think is performing the best sort of service to society.

It. will be worth the editor's time to reﬂect What
a service the paper is giving its readers, collectively
and individuallyiespecially the paper's editorial page.

A genuine editorial page will ﬁght with courage,
independence, and perfect fairness for everything that
the town needs, and has a probability of getting if the
community can be led into a sincere desire and deter-
mination for it. In northwestern Iowa just now some
of the courageous and far-visiohed editors are ﬁghting
for paved highways. They know, as every intelligent
man knows, that the time is now here when Iowa conne
ties Without such roads Will be regarded as back number
countles, that form and city values will alike fall off,
and that trade will suffer. With this conviction ﬁrmly
established in their minds they can meet, brickbats With
philosophical equanimity.

Another Service of the editorial page is to ﬁght
against graft and corruption, against dirt, physical and
moral, for beauty instead of squalor, for neatness and
cleanliness instead of slovenly disorder, for more and
better education, for everything that. will make the town
and its tributary territory better, sweeter, and happier.

For the individual the editorial page gives sound
information and logical interpretation of current prob»
lems. It helps to socialize him, to make him like-minded
with the best thought of his community. If he is a
squanderer, it teaches him thrift; if he is o. Scrooge,
it loosens his purse strings, especially around Christmas
time. If he is selﬁsh and hardehearted it teaches him
sympathy, consideration for others, and perhaps helps
him to realize the great truth that the greatest happi—
ness in this world comes form doing something, contine
ually doing something, to help others.

Such an editorial page will always be read. And
it will bring more actual roses and violets than verbal
hrichbats. This writer knows that to be true from years
of personal experience.
