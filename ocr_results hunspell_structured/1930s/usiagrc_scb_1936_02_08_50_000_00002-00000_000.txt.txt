AN IMPORTANT TREND /

The histor‘ of American political parties since the founding
of this country shows a unique development for each port did
not represent it split along the usual liberal and consem tivc
lilies, but instead each tried to arrange platforms that would
concilintn lmtll factions in the party.

The result has been some of the most adept political fence
straddling platforms that human ingenuity could devisei Time
and again, close analysis of each party’s platform showed that
noting definite was stated, and the result has been that con
structive action by the party in power has often times been lllllr
dared: by internal dissensioni

With the advent of the New. Deal administration, the old
party lines began to disintegrate and instead, the liberals, both
Democratic and Republican, have been to a great extent rallye
ingl under the Liberal, even radical doctrines of the present
administration, while conservatives ili both parties have been
gathering together under the banners of the Republican party.

This seems to indicate that the old idea of being either a
Democrat or a Republican is passing and instead the idea of
supportinfg either the liberal or conservative party is coming
in.

The many radical and seemingly ill-advised: measnr
passed under the New Deal administration show a pressing
need for an opposition which will really be able to exert some
influence upon legislation. Under our former system this was
hard to accomplish, especially when the party in power come ill
with overwhelming majority and the party leaders proceeded
to crack the pdtl‘onagc whip. The results have been too op-
parent.

Now at last there seems to be developing a remedy for the
situation. and‘ regardless of what Roosevelt has accomplished or
failed to accomplish, if his policies result ill the development
of a conscrvati c and o libcral party, then he will indeed have
accomplished an important thing in the American political life.

A PROGRESSIVE STEP

The recent introduction of the idea of each student having
a. ”field of concentration” instead of the old major and minor
system is certainly an indication of the changing idea of the
purposes of ll college education.

No longer i
specialize ili one particular field, but instead there is the grow
illg rcali' tioli that one of the fundmncntzll purpo es of college
is to give, the students an opportunity to get it bl'oa knowledge
and to become better informed.

This new ideal ol‘ :1 collcgc’ purpose is but a realization
of the present trend, and the faculty are to be congratulated
for placing r'riliiicll in the front rank of the progressive educar
tionol institutions at this country.

In the distant future a medical

In further explaining the plan,
Mr. Thomas said, "No emphasis is
being placed upon the type of job
that the student holds. For exam-
ple, an A71 janitor can classify
for the higher divisions much
quicker than can a Waiter , for
there are certain advantages to
the waiting job, which makes it
the more desirable."

Commitwe to Decide Pay

The rate of pay which each
employee will get will be deter-
mined by a committee composed
of the supervisor of employment,
the house director or the superi -
tendent of buildings and grounds,
and the immediate supervisor of
the worker.

“It has been found that the
present system of one rate of pay
for all students has tended to dis-
coursgc some who might have
been better workmen," Mr. Thom-
as declared. “In spite of the fact
that the college is doing these
young people a service, many of
them have taken the attitude that
they will do just enough to get by.
This is by no means true of all of
them, yet we have done nothing to
recognize the student who has
been an excellent workman," he
continued ”This is the situation
which the new plan is designed to
remedy."
