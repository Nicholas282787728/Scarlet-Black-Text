Cagers Seek
to Break Tie
for Third

Play Washington Bears
at St. Louis, Mo.,

This Evening

Pioneer cagers will seek to
break a tie for third place in the
Missouri valley race tonightwhen
they meet the erratic Washington
university Dears at St. Louis, Mo.
Grinnell, tied with Creighton and
Tulsa for third, may secure unr
disputed possession of third place,
should they win and the Joys
lose this weekend.

Coach John c. Truesdale and
nine men left last night for St.
Louis, They will return to Grille
‘nell late Sunday night to begin
preparations for their return
meeting with the Bears here next
Saturday.

Make Trip

The men making the trip are:
Cuecaptain Hal Dean, Bill Fowler,
and Bob Berry, guards; Wilbur
Luick and Vernon Cornish, cenr
ters; and Jolm Hayward, Bill Con-
will, Vern Robinson, and Lynn
Sampson, forwards.

Because of the loss of dim La-
hlasney, veteran forward, Coach
Truesdale will be forced to start
John Hayward and Bill Conwill at
the forward berths Luick will
hold down the center positions,
while Dean and Berry will defend
the backcourt.

Depend Upon Deon

Crinnell's offensive will depend
mainly upon Hal Dean, sharp-
shooting guard, the only player
who has been hitting the hoop
consistently. During the recent
southern road trip, which resulted
in two victories in three games
for the Pioneers, Dean was high
point man against both Tulsa and
Washburn.

Washington remains an un—
known quantity because of erratic
play, which has resulted in their
loss of four out of five loop
games, Their sole victory was
chalked up against Tulsaa

Washington Weaker Team.

Washington rates the weaker
team both defensively and of-
fensively according to statistics
on points scored and allowed op—
ponents. In six games, Crinnell

reporting regularly to the Drake

,abilities.”

Angry Wives Advised to Feed,
Curse, and Then Kiss Husbands

Feed him, curse him, kiss him.

That is the formula prescribed
by Dr, Samuel H. Kramcs of the
Psychiatric institute in Chicago
and the University of Illinois
school of medicine for a wife to
settle quarrels with her husband.
This advice was part of a lecture
on “Marriage” given for senior
women at Grinnell college Thurs
day evening.

“Give your husband a good din
car, then lay all your cards on th
table," Dr. 1<raines proposed.
“After you have called him all the
names you can think ofik' s

him!”

“Marriage may be a 50750 prop-
osition, but that doesn’t mean that
.you wash one dish whilc in Wash—

es the other," he declared, Adjust»
ment on cach side is his idea of
the way to a successful married
life. “You may havc to let him
smoke his foul-smelling ,pipc," he
said, “but maybe you can get a
Ellew drcss out of the bargain."

‘ A. year is long enough for an
engagement in most cases, he be-
lieves. After that the uncertainty
of the situation causes most eh-
'gagements to fall.
