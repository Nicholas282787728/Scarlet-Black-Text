Freshman Learn
Etiquette Rules

In Orientation

By Sidney Bowen.

No guest should brush up crumbs
from the tahlc nor stack his dish-
es, While conversing, no guest
should hrandish his silver in the

air or use it to demontrate his re-
marks.

From a group of intelligent
questions such as these, freshmen
last week were given extensive
instruction in preparation for the
annual etiquette examination.

High hopes were held by Shel-
ton L. Beatty, dean of mell, and
the housc mothers, who,worked
in collaboration with the deans
on the exam, that the drills would
make for imp ~ovement and stand-
ardization in Grinnelrs dining
room manners.

Instead of the usual long etis
quettc test, several short quizzes
and a practical test were given
this year. Theoretical rcsults
were scan in the answers received.

Some of the props learned from
their instructions that fingerbowls
should be avoided, eaten, present-
ed, passed, and used by dipping
and drying, not drinking.

When passing a plate for a sec-
ond helping, the ltnifc and fork
should he “placed parallel in an
eleven-to»[0ur position, as on a
clock."

Highest score made in the ex-

siblc 68.

The movement for Grinnell to

l A hE-BIBTH or PRESTIGE

One year ago today an early morning extra edition of the
Scarlet «ml Black announced the withdrawal of Grinnell
from the Missouri Valley conference. In that edition, all
editorial briefly informed readers that the action taken by
the faculty committee on athletics was ”0. K. with us.”

Since that day, the campus has lived ill anticipation—
\l‘oudel‘lng what to expect of Grinnell’s athletic future. Now
our athletic future is assured, and we can take out a new
lease on life.

The joining of the Mid~West conference is definitely a
cementing of the sane athletic policy upheld by the admins
istrfltion of this illstituton.

The heat is off the student body, and the athletic depart—
ment in general. No longer will Grillnell be expected to
compete on all equal basis with larger institutions that pur—
Suﬁ an entirely different athletic policy from that of Grin-
ne .

From now on the majority of the Pioneers inter- ollegi—
ate athletic competition will be with colleges of their own
level of competition, where the practice of proselyting
athletes is at the very minimum,

All this will mean a return to winning ways for Gl-innell
teams. The defeatist attitude will be replaced by u willJio-
will complex that can be realized.

Instantaneous and phenomenal success is not expected or
anticipated in the new conference, because the competition
there is Oil a Very high level.

What we mean to say is that Grinnell teams will begin
to win their share of games, instead of ekillgmut an occa-
sional victory here and there.

To the Student body and to the administration, it- means

a return to happier days and fl rebirth of Gl‘innell athletic
prestige.

annual winter meeting held yes—
terday and today at Chicago's
Hotel Sherman,

The Pioneers withdrew from the

 

«r

Missouri Valley conference one
year ago today when the faculty
committee on athletics, headed by
Earl D. Strong, professor of econ-

standing invitation issued several
years ago to the Pioneer institu-

I on athletics voted to accept the

 

History of the Pioneers' new ath-
letic association was learned yes-
terday by long distance tclephone
to George w. Bryant of One col-
lege. seCl‘etal'y-treadurer of the
Mid-West conference.

Bryant explained that on Dec.
30, 1920, at the request of Knox
college of Galesburg, 111., a group
of midwest colleges met in Chica-

o.

g Plans were discussed at that
time of organi 'hg' a conference
of small middle western colleges.
The only immediate action taken
at that time was to plan a track
meet to be held in Chicago, May
13, 1921.

On that date, a committee was
appointed of representative col-
leges to draft a constitution and
to organize.

 

Colleges that were charter
members at the organization of
the Mid-West were Cornell and
Coe of Iowa; Hamlinc and Carle-
ton of Minnesota; Beloit of Wis-
consh and Knox and Monmouth
of Illinois.

Formal organization of the
conference was completcd May 19,
1922, at Carleton college, North-
ficld, Minn.

A few ycars later, Lawrence
and Ripoli colleges, both of Wis~
cousin, were admitted to the Mid-
Wes In the late 1920's, Jamcs
Millihin university of Decatur,
111., Joined the organization but
droppcd out after holding meme
bcrship for only one year.

In 1931, Hamhne withdrew from
the conference, and since then
thcrc have been no changcs in

 

invitation to join the Mid-West

the personnel until Grinncll's re-
cent admittance.

Bryan explained that the Mid-
West conference has always de-
sired to have Grinnell as one of
its members.

They had several applications
from other Iowa colleges for
membership but they were reject
ed because the Mill-West’s consti-
tution states that only three col-
lcgcs irom one state may hold
membership.

Coc and Cornell wanted the
other college from Iowa to be
Grinncll, and it was their voting
that kept other schools out, malt»
ing it possible for the pionccrs
to join, Bryant said.

Admittance is only gained by
unanimous vote of all the colleges
in the MltlaWest.

 

confelenee. All that remained was
the approval by the Mid-West of
Grinnell's acceptance, which was
accomplished this morning.
