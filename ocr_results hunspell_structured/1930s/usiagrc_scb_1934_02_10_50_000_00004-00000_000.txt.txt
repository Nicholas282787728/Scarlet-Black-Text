in Last Half, 25-24

lContiniied from page 1)
from the foul line put Drake ahead
is to 1?.

Dick Mason put the Pioneer quin-
tet hack in the load with a nice shot
sunk on the run. Olipliant then caught
the spirit of the thing and loopcd in
another to set his outfit out in front
21 to 18.

Rally Ended

Thc Criniicll rally was ahruptly
ended as Swan, who had replaced the
elongated Cole at center for the
Bulldogs, whipped in a corncr shot,
McCloud sank a nice one—handed shot
to regain the lead for Drake and
Smith contributed one from the foul
circle to boost the margin to three
points, 24 to 21.

At this point Smith, Bulldog for-
ward, was dismissed from the fray on
fouls, and the o-foot 7-inch cole rec
entered the game for Drake. Mantis
diminished the Drake load by a point
with a free throw. out Cole imme
diately tallied a hasket milking the
count 25 to 22. Bauer completed the
scoring with a short shot.

Lust Minutes Scoreless

Three minutes of the contest re-
malned, and from that point on,
nothing seemed to be barred. Wrest-
ling was much in evidence, and foot-
ball tactics were in general use.
Grinnell responded to Drake’s disore
ganizcd stalling attempts by hurried
and over-anxious tiies at the basket,
and neither outfit was able to score.

McCloud, speedy Bulldog forward,
was high point man for the contest,
ringing up four baskets and a free
throw for nine counters. He was
closely followed by Mason and Bauer,
who each contributed eight points to
the Pioneer total.
