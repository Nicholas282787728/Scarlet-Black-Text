JOHN L. LEWIS

Five million men and women would be out
of Work if there should be a general strike
in the United States. While Samuel Gom-
pel‘s lived such a thing was impossible for
he realized that public opinion would not
support such a move. Nor has William
Green’s American Federation of Labor sup-
ported a general strike or tried to organize
the mass production industries which a1—
rcady pay the highest wages in the country
voluntarily.

Now, for the first time, such a situation
is impossible because of one man who re
gnrds labor not as an industrial problem, but
as a political one. This man is John L.
Lewis and he is out to break the A. F. of L.
and force labor to join the C. I. O. by the
use of any means at his command.

One of his tools is the illega “sit down
st he." Others are his policy of disorgan-
izing production in the mass production in—
dustries when wages are up and workers
have a chance to come back after the de-
pression, and his bringing of men from
one industry to unionize another.

A picket line of United Mine Workers
can close down any factory in the country
just as a handful of workers call “sit down"
and stop production in a factory. Public
opinion can and should stop these tactics
and require that difficulties be al‘bitl‘ated in
a logical and legal way. JS

FOR REAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT

(Editorial Chairman's note: This is the thll‘d
in E. series of editorials dealing with various phases
of student government. They are written to in-
form the student body of the various duties and
qualifications of the officers Whom the students
will be called upon to elect within the next two
months. Other editorials dealing with the topic
of student government will be published from
time to time.)

One of the important questions which is
raised on the Grinnell campus from time to
time is exactly how much student govern-
ment Grinllcll students are allowed to have.

Grinnell students complain that the ad
ministration is unfair to them in the matter
of student government, and that the college
officials refuse to let them actually exercise
real powers of self-government. If the stu—
dents of our college could realize the utter
lack of student government in some of our
American colleges and universities they
would realize the liberal attitude which is
taken by our college administration on this
question. It has grown to be a tradition at
Grinnell for students to be allowed great
liberties in student government. The fac—
ulty has never refused to accept a plan of

THE GRIN'NELL SCARLET AND BLACK

self»govcrllment which was presented in a
responsible way by the students.

In a recent statement to the editorial
board of the Scarlet and Black one of our
college officials wrote: ”Grinnell students
can have all the self-government that they
are prepared to handle effectively." We are
wondering if the administration hasn’t al—
lowed some of our student governmental
organizations much more freedom than they
deserve and much more responsibility than
they are capable of bearing. The conditions
for study in some of our college residences
are enough to cause thoughtful students to
wonder.

With the liberal attitude on the pelt of
the college administration in regard to stu-
dent government, a well-organized govern»
mental set-up could be maintained. But to
achieve good student government, the stu-
dents themselves, vel'y obviously, must co—

operate.

Other Opinions

LOST ATLANTIS 0F GO-EDS
(McGill Daily)

Statistics sometimes illuminate strange facts,
nothing stranger than the revelation that most
coveds don't marry. The cream of a country’s
femininity, they are doomed to drift into a sombre
spinsterbood. Why?

It is somewhat of an axiom that girls come to
college mainly for social reasons and those reasons
in the majority of cases swing back and forth
along the pendulum-ideal of manage. This, a bald
statement to make, admittedly, is the type of ar-
gument that immediately arouses a host of critical,
and a larger host of non-critical, dissent. Never-
theless the condition exists—college to the average
owed is in the first place a. likely atmosphere in
which to select a husbandrwbether he wills or
not. In the second place comes acquisition of
knowledge, which is obviously important in the
makeup of the modern woman and which we do
not intend to belittle in its role as, de facto, a.
vital cause of screds' college attendance. This very
collegevimposed “intelligence" is the rock on which
the marriage ideal breaks as we believe can be

shown.

in the swirl and drift of college life, complex in
the extreme, made up of every sort of experlence
curl circled by a vortex of varying emotion, the
co-ed often must think that the nucleus of a per-
fect marriage is to be found. And, truthfully, a
number of coeds do make happy marriages, prob—
ably happier by far than any other marriages. But
what makes caved marriages seem so great, when
they are not, is that it is startling to hear of
someone known at college suddenly married. Con-
sequently such martial ventures receive great pub-
licity on the campus and people are apt to say
“Why, all my old college friends are married!” or
“Isn’t it astonishing how many co-cds actually get
married, and so soon after graduation?” Undere
graduates count up the number of girls in the
graduating class of the year before who have
married and exclaim over their count. But they
forget to count the number of coeds who aren‘t
married, who won’t be maﬁed.

Is is because co—cds are not attractive enough to
lure men? Absolutely not. Look at any college
revue, look at any co~ed class. Then this most
important of reasons can be wiped off as invalid.
once again, why?

If one must find an answer, it would seem to be
the fault of the weeds in a way that they might
not suspect, Cureds are influenced far more than
they think by the intellecmal aspect of college.
Whether or not they absorb what they hear in
classes is another thing, as is the problem as to
whether they do any real thinking. But a Certain
atmosphere, essentially educated, is built up
around them and their standards change. The re-
sult is that they cannot "fall for" any man. This
is the truth of the whole problem. The man they
seek becomes a much rarer individual, a sort of
phantom of qualities, as well as sex-appeal. Where
as Sally O'Grady, housemaid, finds her dreams
realized in some young man who is a Typical Spec—
imen, homo sapiens strong and generally simple.
Like it or not, coeds often pass up marriage be-
cause they are not able to think of it in terms of
the innumerable youths who present themselves,
let alone some of the older men. Again. a good
many of the eligible male undergraduates do not
want marriage until late in life because they real—
ize the terrific millstdnc it is around a young
man's neck until he has established himself in the
hostel of life. This tendency is on the increase.
Twenty-eight is the average age for men when
they go to the alter. it is probably higher for
college graduates. Thus this holds up and some
times destroys cared marriage schemes.

The percentage of oo~eds who don‘t marry is
probably higher in the United States than in
Canada. But here too it is higher than is usually
thought.

In short, what price marriage, Miss Co-Ed?
