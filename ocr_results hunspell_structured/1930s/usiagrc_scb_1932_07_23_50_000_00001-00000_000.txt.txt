Taylor's performance is remarkable
in view of the fact that he has already
represented the United States twice
before in Olympic competition and is
at present thirty years old. Track
athletes will usually bum themselves
out in a short period of time, but
Taylor's remarkable stamina has Carr
ried him through a ten~year period
of competition.

Taylor Wins Eurly Heats

Three preliminary heats were nec-
essary in the huge Stanford stadium
before the final decision was made.
The former Grinnell star, who is now
a member of the illinois A. C,, pro-
vided one of the sensations of Fn'z
day's program when he assayed his
winning comeback to keep Eugene
(Red) Record, crack Harvard hurler,
from qualifying. Taylor later won his
heat of the semi-finals, beating Glenn
Hardin of Louisiana.

to the finals Hardin captured first
place, but was later disqualified when
the A. A, U. officials ruled that he
had interfered with Taylor, crossing
over in his lane and clearing the
wrong hurdle, This gave Taylor sec-
ond place, but inasmuch as only three
of the four finalists finished, Hardin
retained his place on the team,

Pre-School Nursery ,
Offers, Advantages

Constructive effort in the field of
psychology has one of its most dis-
tinctive evidences in the Pre»5chool
Nursery for children of preschool
age, sponsored by the department of
psychology at Grinnell college and
under the direction of Miss Margaret
Neshitt of Detroit and Professor
Douglass, head of the department.

There are 14 children in attend-
ance at the regular periods from 9:00
to 11:30 daily, The value of the out-
door nursery for the children cannot
be ovcrcmpbasized, because they re-
ceive the utmost care in their train-
ing, which is carried on through work
and play in both individual and group
activity. The nursery is located west
of the women’s gym in the open air.
Recreational facilities include sand
boxes, slides, and swnigs. Included in
the group activities are stories, songs,
and games.

Miss Nesbitt is in charge, having
done similar work at the Merrill
Palmer school in Detroit for two
years. She will return there in the
fall.

The nursery is used in connection
with the class in Psychology of the
Pre-School Child, a group of nine
students who make observations on
the growth and methods of training
of the children.

Children who attended are: Mar-
garet Hoyt, Robert Inglis, David
Peck, Jr., Billy Ray George, Helen
Steffanou, Betty Lou Douglass,
Richard Weeks, Joan Padgham, Almi-
kki Holtz, Sybil Osborn, David Mar-
lowe, Joan » Fritz, and Doris Ann
Duke.

lowing much discussion the curricu-
lum committee hzls decided to shift
the date of the opening of school back
one week.

Originally freshman days were to
have begun September 6, but this was
later amended to September 13. and
printed as such in the official college

Dibble Hall Wins Fifth Straight
Intramural Title and Pottle Trophy

tinued its unbroken record as posses-
sor of the Pottle Trophy, the intra-
mural traveling award, which so far
seems to have done little traveling.
it was introduced six years ago and
Dibble has won the honors each year,

The season just passed was the
fifth year of the intramural athletic
system under its present organiza~
tion. Three years ago, Dibble acquired
permanent possession of the first
Pottle Trophy, and have two legs on
the present cup.

For awhile, the battle between
Dibble, Clark, and Langan promised
to be a heated one, but after spring
vacation Dibble demonstrated her
superiority by winning tennis, track,
and baseball. Although she shared a
tie with Gates in baseball, shc Suf~
fercd no loss as far as points were
concerned.

es.

Coach Lester L. Watt will have 12
Veterans on hand when practice be-
gins September 10 in preparation for
the opening encounter with Penn
September 23 or 24, besides a goodly
number of sophomores and reserves.

Track coach G. Lester Duke will
have plenty of experienced men to
work with when the indoor sea-
son begins at the start of the second
semester. He will have a wellzbal-
anced nucleus of 11 lettermen around
which he will build the 1533 track
team.

3 Cage lettermen

Although Coach John C. Truesdale
will only have three monogram win-
ners to work with, excellent material
from the freshman squad of last year
should enable him to turn out a crack
basketball team. He will build his at-
tack arountl Captain Duncan and
Frye, forwards, and Ullrich, guard.

Grinnell should have the best cross-
country team in the history of the
Ischcol next year. Myron Pilbrovt‘ has'
already established himself as one
of the country's leading tu-oemilersn
whiic Joe Pfelffer's experience in road ‘
races ranks him almost even with
the Pioneer track captain. 1n addie
tion, Coach Rosen will have Don
,Barber and Tom Gordon, who have‘
also demonstrated their worth. With
this quartet as a nucleus. Rosen can
turn out a_ well-balanced aggregation.

prospects in this field should in no
way dampen his ardor, Four letter-

crowd, Dibble, after a run of 37 con-v,
secutive speedball triumphs, suffer~l
ed a letdown in 1931 and could not;
regain her winning stride last year.

Langan took cross country honors
with Joe Pfeiffer and Don Teraberry
finishing strong. Langaa and Dibble
shared a tie in basketball, by virtue
of their better-balanced aggregations.
Clark’s A team and Gates‘ B swept
through an undefeated season, but
their strength was too concentrated.

Dibble came to the fore in swim-
ming and water polo, but finished
farther down in indoor baseball
where she was the victim of had
breaks throughout the schedule.

The increasing strength of the
other halls threatens Dibble's ath-
letic superiority next season and in
years to come. Langan has always
been a threat, while Clark and Gates
have acquired new power. Every
indication points to a close struggle
next fall with five buildings battling
to keep Dibble from acquiring perm-
anent possession of the cup.

New Students
Have Meeting
Tuesday Night

Committee Plans Program
of First Week’s Events

for Incoming Class

The first scheduled meeting for all
new students, including freshmen
and transfers, will be held in the
Quadrangle Theater at 8 p. m., Tues-
day, September 20, immediately fol-
lowing a dinner in the Quadrangle
dining room. Upperclassrnen will not
report until Thursday, September 22.

The program of Freshman Days
will extend from September 20 to
September 26, and will be devoted to
making new students feel at home.
Freshman Days are of outstanding
service to the new students in par—
ticular and to the college as a whole.
They help to a large extent in weld-
ing the new class together, they ac»
quaint the new people with the cam-
pus and its customs, and they go a
long way toward making a loyal, en-
thusiastic, and unified class.

Divided in Groups

New students are to be divided in-
to groups, each with a faculty ad-
viser, who is chosen according to the
major interest of the student. Two up-
perciassmen act as assistant advis-
ers, These groups are kept through-
out the year for registration pur-
poses, so that faculty advisers will
have nn opportunity to know and ﬁne
struct each student personally. Fresh~
men are given an opportunity to meet
many of the student officers with
whom they are to work, and also be-
come acquainted with the principles
and operation of student government.

At the first meeting of new stu-
dents Tuesday evening. Miss Toinette
Swan of the department of Public Re-
lations will preside. An introduction
of administrative officers, and ex-
planation of freshman registration
and curriculum will take place. Miss
Swan will introduce President Nollen:
Miss Read, dean of women; Mr.
Beatty, dean of men; and Miss Me-
Candless, registrar.

Grinnou vs. Penn

New students will eat together for
the first few meals, but after Thurs-
day the men will be served in the
dormitory dining room. The Crinnell—
Penn football game which is sched-
uled for the night of September 23
or 24 will possibly necessitate a

Coach Duke Leaves ,
for Olympic Games

C. Lester Duke, Crinnell track
mentor, left here Friday bound for
Los Angeles and the Olympic Games
carnival, Traveling with him were
Paul Eastridgc of Grinnell, and
Sumner Thompson of Bisbee, Arizona
who will make the trip as far as his
home.

Coach Duke plans to pick up Doc
Huff, former Grinnell athlete and
track coach, who is now head track
coach at the University of Missouri.
The party will make the trip to Cali-
fornia via the southern route, ac-
cording to Duke, who wants to get
a glimpse of the scenery offered in
Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.
He plans to return by a different
route, probably through the northern
section of the country.

Arrive Wednesday

The delegation will reach Los
Angcles by Wednesday if they do
not encounter misfortune, and will no
doubt economize by sleeping at the
more respectable tourist camps along
the way. “If 1 can find any,” Duke
adds.

Huff will get an opportunity to see
Morgan Taylor in action once again.
Taylor ran for the scarlet and black
when Huff was coaching here, and
was Huff's star pupil.

Last year Huff was presented to
the homecoming crowd between
halves of the Crinncll—Washiugton
game when he brought his Univers-
ity of Missouri two-mile team here

 

for a dual with the Pioneers.
