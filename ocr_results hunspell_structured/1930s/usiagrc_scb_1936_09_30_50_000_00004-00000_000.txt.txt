STUDENT SUPPRESSION

“Tear Bombs Rout Students l” No, this
story in yesterday’s paper is not from
Shanghai or Paris as you might guess but
from the peaceful interior of the United
State. In recent years police have used
violence against students in all pa 'ts of the
world. Only last winter in one of the many
Chinese student demonstrations, Peiping po—
lice sprayed hundreds of parading students
with icy water, beat lnany, both men and
women, and killed several.

Now comes this gas bombing of high
school students in Campbell, 0. Perhaps,
the students were in the wrong; the trans—
ferring of it teach= is hardly a justifice-
tion for a student strike, we admit; but the
hasty action of the police, while doing no
serious physical damage, surely did not help
to instill good will and a conciliatory splr '
in either the minds of the students or the
administration. We agree with the Daily
Northwestern editorial quoted in the last
issue of the Scarlet and Black, that a school
exists for the students, and that they
should have a say in its affairs. They are
not simply slaves to be ruthlessly kept in
submission by the police.

Obviously anyone who stirs up hate
and ill feeling in the mind of his opponent
is not making for a just and happy settle-
ment of the conflict. Police and school ad-
ministrators who use violent methods
against students are not teaching youth
the right Way to settle disputes and should
not be tolerated in positions of authority.
Ruthless use of force has never gained any-
thing and never will.

_G—
A “GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT?”

In the recently announced cooperative
understanding between the United States,
Great Britain, and France for the devalua-
tion of the franc is seen a distinct effort
to bring about more comfortable economic
relations among the nations of the world.
Now, for the first time ill economic history,
the whole world is on a managed currency
basis and the success or failure of this move
to establish more formal financial relations
among the world powers depends largely on
the respect the United States, Great Britain
and France have for their “gentleman’s
agreement."

Under the present arrangement each
nation still has considerable control of its
own affairs, and should this agreement
prove to be unbinding to the extent that the
existing good will among these three nations
is lost, a currency war would be almost inc—
vitable and extremely disastrous. In this
movement, however, may be seen a distinct
force towards international peace, for there

——R. G.

is no doubt that the agreement has done
more to loosen the taut, economic ropes
which have been dragging Europe into all—
other war, than many of the negotiations
the League of Nations has attempted.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that
if all nations would reduce tariff restrictions
a little, there might be a rejuvenation ill
world trade which would result in a new
inter-dependence of nations on each other
and hence bring about a more Sympathetic
understanding on the part of- each nation
for all others. But a lot depends on a mere
“gentleman’s agreement." R.M.P,

OUR EDI ORIAL EXPERIMENT

(Editor‘s Note: The following editorial is re»
printed from the Daily Northwestern and indicates
the growing tendency of the college press and
college in general to take on a more serious aspect.
While much of the editorial is of purely local na
ture, still there is much that applies to any college,
and we think it highly worth your time to read

this item).
*mke»

This is the first of 124 issues of The Daily
Northwestern, It is customary each year for the
editors of the Daily to inform its reading con—
stituency, a good part of which is the [rcshmali
class, that your very wish is our command‘that
after all, we are merely rohots under your direc-
tion.

This is not true, We have ideas, lots of them,
about how the Daily should he run; our greatest
hope is that our conception of what a college
newspaper should be will coincide with yours. We
are taking this opportunity to outline our policy,
the policy that will be in effect until it meets with
your and our concerted disapproval.

The first requisite of a college paper is that
it express the prevailing tone of the campus. The
assumption on which we are goingithis after
three years of patient observationiis that the
dominant note on the Northwestern campus is a
serious one. The world is not too much with us,
but we strenuously object to raising the Junior
Prom to an academic pinnacle, In a world 01
revolution and imminent war, it is utter folly for a
college campus or a college newspaper to continue
its curworn Joe College act.

We are, consequently, eliminating all traces of
a gossip column. Stooge, last year's monument to
those who seek a vicarious thriu, has gone to the
electric chair: its death will he mourned by few.
The woman's page, formerly devoted to cosmetics
and coquetry, will gve editoral treatment to issues
concerning the cried and the coed's point of view.
The news pages will give preference to stories of
real, vital interest, and will minimize feature stor-
ies about how John lost his freshman cap, which
was found by Marylou, who won John's heart with
his cap.

The editorial page will also reflect this change
in policy. We may go into a song and dance cc-
casionally, but very rarely will we trip the light
fantastic. You may call us hoityrtoity, but never
hi~dc-ho.

We have said enough to give you an idea 01

our plans. It may not be the kind of ”welcome"
you expect, but if your back has been slapped in
the past few days as much as we think it has, you
Won’t mind giving rotarianism a rest.
\ Life is real, life is earnestiand we're going
to hitch our wagon to a star. Ride along with us.
If we fall. We'll fall with a bong. But tf we ride,
we‘ll ride high.

THIS COLLEGIATE WORLD

Would you believe it? Here we had thought
that the literary lights hall blown out of sports.
Bill Shakespeare graduated from Notre Dame, and
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow left Northwestern.
But no. Now “The Last of the Mohicans," James
Fenimore cooper, has popped up at Marquette U.

v a a

The poor coeds at German universities and coir
leges acquire their education by degrees, and at the
end of their courses most of them can't get their-
diplomas anyway.

Only a limited number of womenﬁenough to fill
vacancies in special professions, are given the
chance to vviite exams for their degrees. So Gretch-
en can't finish her schooling and expect to search
for a position.

if she isn‘t offered a job and with it the oppor
tunity to pass the final test, she has to he content
with saying: “Heck, I didn’t want the darn old thing
anyhow." .13. so geht’a.

We suppose that Langan will
probably claim some kind of a race

men attending church the first

Social Note: Yestei-dty the
little wrcn and the editor color
hratod 12 moons of steady coni-
paiiioriship amid the congratula-
tions and best wishes of some of
the other best people. We found
out that one year really isrrt
wry much, being informed wc
were pikers compared to [seem
and Long, and Graves and Shoul-
horg. u is further discovered that
Berger met his mate three long
years ago when he hliriiuoldcd
himself and let 1va at a herd hook
with a pencil. Although we
don't subscribe to this method
ourselves, it may prove a help
ful hint to some of the lonesome
Lotliai-ios among the Props.

Faculty Club Note: While Mr.
colson was receiving the plaudits
of fellow faculty members at the
reception the other evening, said
congratulations being the result of
the new baby, someone made the
rather had blunder of congratulat-
ing our own Henry Alden upon be~
ing a father. Such a case of a mis-
taken ideiitity reminds us that

Spencer is a rviinger for Guy Kibe

hee.

All this week at football prac-
tice we have been trying to
make the acquaintance of Mel-

Political Note; All these straw
votes have got me muddled. Reese
evelt leads in Gallup’s survey,

Landon leads in the Literary Di-

gest poll, and Lemke is running

ahead in the Social Justice rag.

Within a couple of week we are

going to institute a straw vote to

end straw votes by getting the
representative Grinncll vote,

WATCH FOR IT. (This is posi-

tively not a circulation stunt.)

Following the lead of other
noted and lazy columnists, we
are going to spice things up
with a guest column once in a
while, Next week the first of
these will appear written by a
couple of freshmen, who will
give some impressions. In order
that we can get something red
hot we will preserve the anony-
mity of the writers, who haven't
been selected yet.

We suppose you are eagerly
awaiting the Doric's survey of
freshman women, Really, boys, we
haven't much to offer, as yet, We
understand that Mary Beth Gee
isn’t bad, but last week's hint
about the redhead can’t amount to
much. We saw Leanord with the
gal at open house. Fuchs thought
he harle something spotted from

Oskaloosa, but the girl, who is

about half his size, had already

teamed up with "Doc" White.
