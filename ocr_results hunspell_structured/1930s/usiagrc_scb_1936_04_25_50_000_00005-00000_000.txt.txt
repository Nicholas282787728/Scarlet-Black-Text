Kent state pilots, who banded
together in 1933 and built the
world's largest glider, a two-seater

hoping to get confirmation of an
unofficial world record On one
of its 1935 flights, the ship climbed
from a standing start to 1700 feet
in one minute and one second,
carrying two men. The Kent club's
glider has made 1,000 flights with»

An ambitious endurance flight
program is being planned by Wash‘

want to keep a ship in the air so

Manuel, Williamson Ensemble
Rated Unique in World’ by Critics

Famed Group to Appear
Here In Concert

May 1

Tho Manuel and Williamson
Harpsichord ensemble, presenting
music for one, two, three and four
Harpsichords, strings and voice,
"unique in the world," will appear
in concert in Herrick chapel May‘
1. Semester fee tickets will ad-
mit.

Mr, Manuel was born at Canton,
Minn, His first intensive study of
his instrument was provided for
him at Shattuck Military school.
Following his graduation fmln
Shattuck, he was enrolled in the'
music school at Grinncll. After
completing the courses here, Mon-l
uel went abroad, studying for a}
time in Vienna, and later in Lone
don. He returned to this country
to become head ot the music dee
parlment of the University of!
North Dakota, but after two years:
returned again to Europe, where;
he was enrolled at the Paris Con-‘
scrvatoire.

Williamson A Canadian. l

His colleague, Mr. Williamson,
is a Canadian, and he met Manuel l
for the first time in Minneapolis
some years ago. Williamson was
first educated musically in Boston,
then New York. After a brief‘
career as a youthful prodigy, hel
went abroad to study in Berlin and
later in Paris. In Paris he met
again his present team mate and
both artists decided on piano team.
work as a career.

Ernest Newman, critic of the
London Times, says this of the‘
harpsichord and the music of its
period: "The harpsichord can pro-,
duce so many varieties and mix-
tures of Loneecolor that sometimes
the effect is quasirorchestral. At
a hundred points, as we listen, we
see how true it is that this music
was born out of the very being oi
the harpsichord: for the harpsi-
chord shows us the music, as a
whole and in every point of detail. l
as the composer conceived it."
Del-sloped in Eighteenth Century,
The "Regal Cembalo" reached
the peak of its development about
the middle of the eighteenth cen-
tury. It was consiered the key—
board instrument par excellence;
it was the chief support for sing-
ers; it was the orchestra conduce
tor's indispensable ally; and it was
frequently used in the churches.

, of Bach;
‘ identic disposition

 

uel and Williamson concerts are
closely patterned after the finest
illstrumentsiwith an
of registers.
Each instrument has two manuals,
and seven pedals which scrvc as
stops do on an organ. There are
four strings to each key: one eight
foot string is played from the up-
per keyboard; another eight-fact.
a super-octave, and a subsectave
string, are sounded from the lower-
manual, Any one of these regis-
ters can be brought into play at

’will and in any combination with

each other. The two keyboards
can be coupled. It is possible to
dbtain’ over a hundred varieties of
color from each instrument, ac
cording to D. E. Peck.

After one has listened to a harps
sichoi-d for a given time, his ear
deposits the strumming, rustling.
chiming quality into its rightful
place of characteristic tonal back
ground, and one gathers the great
number of changes of timbre which
sing from thc different types of
strings. Flutes, flagcolcts, oboes,
clarinets, stringed instruments, the
occasional effect of organ peal,
even drum beat when desired, ems
er-ge from the general swirl of

l sound.

Critic Prdlse Duo,

The music critics on the leading
newspapers of the United states
have this to say: "Manuel and
Williamson have won recognition
as the foremost United states
harpsichordlsts. Exquisite technic,
delicate phrasing, subtle manipu-
lation of tone and shading are
theirs. They play with an ensem—
ble that is astonishing, pliable sym.
pathetic and precise. They are a
musical, historical delight. Rarely
have artists met with such appres
ciation. This is a concert from
which almost anyone could get a
thri . It is music alive, informed,
beautiful, passionate and fine.

“The concerts by the Manuel and
Williamson Harpsichord ensemble,
in their novdty. and in the unusual
interest which they create, cannot
be matched on this side of the At—
lantic, Equipped with the most
extraordinary specimens of the
harpsichord-builder's craft, and as~
sociated with an outstanding artis-
tic personnel —— harpsichordists,
string players, and singers long
schooled in this rare and beautiful
musiciMaanuel and Williamson
offer musical experiences hereto-
fore unknown in this country.”

The harpsichords used by Mans
lie! and Williamson were built for
them in the ateliers of Pleyel,
Paris. /

Minnesota Senior
‘Cultivates Beard
by Perseverance

Minneapolis, Minn, (ACP) Loss
ing an inferiority complex, finding
a broadminded, intelligent girl or
impersonating a faculty member
are all as easy as growing whiss
kers,.in the opinion of Herbert
Jensen, University of Minnesota
senior, who is the owner of the
school’s only undergraduate 'beard.

”Everyone I meet suggests a
reason for my beard," he says.
“Just to clarify the situation, let
me say that I have not been disaps
pointed in love. I am not trying to
establish myself as a campus per-
sonality, and I am not mentally
deficient."

“To me my beard has been more
than just whiskers. Psychologi-
cally speaking, it has been a boon
to me in getting rid of an infer-
ion'ty complex; it gives me that
virile feeling.

”I’ll admi though ,that it
doesn‘t exactly please most girls.
But at least I have the assurance
that any girl who goes out with
me is broadminded and intelligent,"
says the bearded man, who has not
revealed the number of such girls
at Minnesota. ' ‘

“My beard also gives me an acas
demic advantage over the smooth
shaven student," Jensen argues.
“Members of the faculty are exs
traordinarily cordial to me, They
nod at me on the street and shake
hands with me in the classroom.
They treat me as a colleague. My
beard gets the credit,” .

Baltimore Drops
Varsity Football,
Cancels ’36 Tilts

Baltimore Md, (ACPliDcﬁns
ite and final discontinuance of
football as an intercollegiate sport
has been announced by University
of Baltimore authorities in what
some observers believe to be a sig-
nificant straw in the wind, indica-
tive perhaps of ultimate abandons
ment of the sport by all colleges.

“Money usually spent on the
football squad," said Vice»Pl'esi-
dent Brown in explanation of the
step, "will instead be reverted to
providing- a Recreation center for
the student body and faculty of the
university, as well as a more e
tensive student intramural activ
tics program.

"The Recreation center has been
a topic of discussion for some time
and the board of tmlstees decided
that it would be better to provide
recreational facilities for the stu-
dent body as a whole, instead of
continuing football for a very small
minority of students. From these
innovations, a greater numbei- will
derive a more important edllca<
tional and fraternal benef‘ "

All 1936 gridiron games were
cancelled.

The university administration
had in mind the will of a majority
of Baltimore students when it took
the step, said an editorial in the
Baloo, weekly paper. Increased
intramural facilities and emphasis
on tennis and baseball are expected
to offset the loss of football for
most of the student body.
