LET’S ARGUE PROFESSOR

All in all, the faculty members at Grinncll
are a very likeable lot, but there is one trait
which students frequently run into when speaking
to a professor—in classroom and out of it—which
no teacher should permit in his make-up. That
is an unwillingness to discuss a question from the
students point of View; to listen to the line of rea-
soning behind his attitude on a matter, and seek
to correct it or recognize its truth.

Not all of the instructors are guilty of this
characteristic, and probably some of those who
are do not realize they possess it. Believe us
though, professor, when we are sure that we have
caught you in some erroneous reasoning, when
we are befuddled by a statement you have made,
or when we have a question which we sincerely
wish to have answered we don’t like to be politely
waved aside or completely ignored.

So why not try to be a little more conscient-
ious in separating the wheat from the chaff in the
matter of classroom question? We’ll admit that
we frequently offer a “smoke-screen” question~
perhaps as a bluff, a stall or just a little legalized
handshakcibut when we have figured out a fool~
proof query we really want the answer to we dis-
like to have it sloughed off.

Moreover, when you realize that you have
made a slip and end an unsuccessful effort to de-
fend the mistake with a remark, “I don’t wish to
discuss it further!” don’t think the ruse fools us.
We know that, despite that Phi Beta Kappa key,
you’re ~bound to make a mistake now and then

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND B CK

and think no less of you for i—if you admit it.
We have to admit errors so often ourselves, you
see.

It all adds up to this. We don’t feel that
your dignity suffers if you argue now and then,
and don’t see why you should feel that it does.
If an argument gives any promiso of actually
getting somewhere, follow it to the end, We’ll
learn more in the long run than if you continue
to lecture while the thought of the class is snagged
on an unanswered question.

TH'E GOLD CLAUSE DECISION

Last Monday the Supreme Court made pub—
lie to an expectant world its decision to uphold
the monetary policy of the New Deal government.
It decided that neither the government nor its
citizens could be held to the letter of their bonds
to settle their obligations in dollars of the old gold
content.

The old dollar is worth in gold $1.69 as
against the new. Claims for those extra 69 cents
on every dollar were what the Supreme Court
passed on Monday; claims made by respective
holders of Liberty bonds, Treasury gold certifi—
cates, and bonds of the Missouri Pacific and the
Baltimore and Ohio railroads. Each of these
.obligations called for payment in dollars of the
old gold content and worth $1.69 in New Deal
currency. The Supreme Court, by a five to four
decision, denied the validity of these claims.

The majority and the minority agreed on on—
ly one pointithat the gold—clause repeal in gov-
ernment contracts was unconstitutional. The
majority however asserted that the Court of
Claims is the only tribunal in which the govern-
ment may be sued, the decision was a practical
dismissal of the suits. In other words, although
the action of the government was unconstitution—
al, it has, in fact, the force of law, because the
holders of bonds containing the gold-clause can-
not collect damages. Bond holders may not sue
for damages in the Court of Claims because ac-
cording to the majority, no damage had been
shown; for in spite of the decrease in the gold
content of the dollar, the New Deal dollar has
relatively the same purchasing power as the old
dollar. Some lawyers hold the opinion however
that if at some future time the dollar is rcvalucd
to a point. where it can be shown in the Court
of Claims that it will purchase less than the dollar
did when a citizen bought a security containing
the gold clause, he can recover the proved diff-
ence under the majority opinion.

The majority judges placed expediency above
a strict interpretation of the Constitution in their
decision. A decision in accordance with the
minon'ty would merely have been a temporary
stumbling block in the administration’s program
for recovery It would have had no practic
effect and would probably have meant a loss or
prestige for the Court. To have upheld the
gold-payment clauses would have added eight
billion, five hundred million dollars to the nation-
al debt and perhaps some 70 billion dollars to the
total funded obligations of corporations.

As it is now, it is undeniable that the decision
of the court had a good effect upon business. It
was hailed on all sides as a definite aid to the
restoration of conﬁdence. Business, which had
been checked abruptly more than a month ago
when the gold clause case first came up, surged
forward actively. The prices of corn, wheat.
and other commodities made good advances. The
immediate effect of the decision has been bene-
ficial. Only time can tell what its ultimate ef-
fects will he,

 

 

 

CHAPEL
NOTES

George Washington reacted to prin.
ciples, Abraham Lincoln to people.
This is the essential difference be.
tween the two men as John P, Ryan,
professor of public spealung, described
them in his chapel talks this week.

“Lincoln began as the world’s worst
public speaker and ended as the
world’s best." Mr. Ryan declared. He
told how Lincoln studied geometry in
order to learn logical structure for his
speeches. The classical beauty of Lin.
coln’s style and structure has made
many of his speeches part of world
literature.

Washington read his addresses in «a
grand manner, but his delivery was
poor, the speaker said. He described
him as the best.dressed man of his
period. “Washington was the best.
balanced man in history,” Mr. Ryan
sated. “He had the Greek concept

of nothing in excess' ."

Friday Assembly

In chapel Friday. rather T. c. Don.
ahue, priest of St. Mary's Catholic
church of Grinnell, told of his discus.
sions with an atheist friend. The
speaker stated that his belief in God
is founded as much on reason as on
iaith.

Man’s nature is not entirely chemi.
cal, he said, nor is his mind constrained
by the confines of space.

“The scholarly mind. touched with
religion, will find much to study on
the borderline between religion and
science,” rather Donahue concluded.
“Reason and faith go along together."

Daily doubtecnsting on the value of
education.

Here are some extracts from exam
returns at the University of California
(Los Angeles): “I love to sit in a quiet
wood and commute with God.” “The
men were tossed and battered into un.
conscientiousness.” “Browning be.
lieves that one moment of real love
is worthy of a lifetime of purity."
“Romeo refused to fight because he
had just been married to Tybalt’s sous»
in and it is not natural lo ra man/to
pick a quarrel or lake on up after such
circumstances." “We use the tele.
scope to get better visions of certain

' obstacles.”
