This ﬁller-noon the Pioneer
traekmen shoved of! — Tulsa
bound. Hopes of a conference
championship, however, were not
as bright today as they were a [cw
days ago, due to the definite an.
nouncernent that Don Bentley,
member of the half mile relay
team, would not be able to run.
His knee tailed to respondtotrcat.
ment, and in a trial ntn Monday
afternoon, he could only turn in a
time ot :55 for the quarter, which
is not fast enough (or the con.
icrence competition.

Bentley has another year oi varsity
competition left and, unless the knee
injury should prove permanent, should
turn in some really fast times his
senior year, He and Barnes will pro.
vide the nucleus for the mile relay
team next year.

Inillrios seem to be bothering at
least one other conference school
—the Aggies. Kenny Gallagher, Ag.

forced to quit the cinder path tor

an knee injury which he suliered
in mid-selson. His absence lrorn

Bradley, Pioneer entry in the shot
put and the discus, will, really meet
plenty of competition Friday night
when he competes against burly Jim
Tichenor who has tossed the lead ball
over 46 feet 101/2 inches in a dual
meet with the Kansas Aggies, and
hurled the discus better than 143 feet
1.4 inches in the same meet. Bradley's
distance in the Carl meet Friday was
130.7 feet which is a wee bit short of
being far enough to seriously worry
Tichenor. However, Bradley will un.
doubtedly place in the discus and per.
haps in’ the shot to give Grimell some
needed points.

To make the role of injured
traekmen complete, add rd Waite,
star Washington sprinter, who has
been nursing a bad knee. Whether
or not he has recovered sutf cnl~
ly to capture ﬁrst in the 100 and
low hurdles at the contcrence re-
mains to be seen, but he will have
to be in the best of condition to
do so.

The Bears seem to have a likely
looking prep miler coming up to the
varsity next year in Frank Wright.
who turned in the time of 4:35 in a
prep meet last weekend. His time
was 20 se'tmnds taster than the Bear
varsity miler could turn in and was

Morley Blames Students
for Failure to Get Jobs

Tuscaloosa, Ala.»(ACP)'~"The dif-
iiculty college graduates experience in
obtdining employment is due in great
part to their own inertia," Dr. Burton
Morley, professor of economics at the
University of Alabama, .declared re-
cently in an interview,

“The better half of any graduating
class—those with the better scholastic
and extra—curricular records—usually
have little trouble, for most of them
will be employed within a period of
not more than six months after grad-
uation," Dr, Morley explained. “It is
those who graduate in the lower half
of a Class—the ‘C’ and 'D’ students who
engage in no campus activities—who

. present the problem."

The lower half students, Dr. Morley
pointed out, have little to otter the
employer. Students who have defray-
ed part or all of their expenses while
going to school reccivc especial con-
sideration from prospective employ-
51‘s.

season here Saturday with a football
game between the varsity and a
strong alumni—reserve aggregation. The
varsity nosed out a 7 to o victory with
a touchdown in the tinal quarter.

Larry Goeckcl, Carl Vinclquerra and
Francis Wilcox joined in making
the only score of the day. Goeckel, at
fullback, started the 70<yard march
with two gains totaling 25 yards and
then he and Wilcox took turns in
lugging the ball to the one.yard stripe.
Vinciquerra entered the game in
Goeckel's place and dived over the
line on his second try.

The alumni with Mike O‘Lea'ry. Pete
Marchetti and Max Egbert showing to
best advantage, proved a stubborn
foe. Twice the old stars were within
the varsity 15-yard line but there the,
were stopped. mo attempu for a

The end of the school year is fast
approaching, and the student's calen.
dar is hell of long papers that must
be in before the evening of May 23,
We feel that many of us do not have
the time to give to the reading of a
long novel because ct this crowded
schedule, but we do feel that a num.
ber at us will want to relax by doing
some reading in the better periodicals.
The icllowing brief reviews are on
articles which caught our interest as
we were reading through these maga—
zines. All of these periodicals are
available at the magazine racks at the
southwest corner of the second floor
reading room of the college library.

w. Ketching. This is the concluding
article on this subject, but a reading of
it will serve to acquaint the reader
with the attitude at the Saracens to»

tian company. None of this material
is particularly new to a student of the
history of the period, but for those
who have never realized the brutality
and coarseness which characterized
the actions of the Crusaders for the
most part, this article will be some.
thing of a revealation. In the March

YOUTH m A CONFUSED wonLn
by John Dewey. Mr. Dewey devotes
his monthly article in this magazine
to the discussion of a question that
has become very pertinent to every
Iowan interested in the treeclom of
educators and educational institutions.
Since our own legislature at this past
session produced a bill which would
limit academic treedcm because of the
dangers which.such liberty might give
birth to, it in interesting to read this

American ideal. His suggestion is that,
should the aroused youth of the land
band together in a youth movement
which was not tempered by a
thorough understanding of existing
mnditions, the reactionaries who have
reared collegiate radicalism would
have an actual situation to tape rather
than a product of their economically
diseased minds. lo the May number

AUSTRIA by Chancellor Kurt Von
Schuschnigg. The creation of the pre—
sent. state of Austria was one of the
more unfortunate mistakes in the
peace settlement following the last
war. An economic impossibility, it
has become a bone of contention be.

endeavored to maintain its independ-
ence, regardless of the price it had to
pay for a consequent economic isola.

article, pleads for a diminution of the
intense indi dualism which has ruled
the minds of European statesmen and

greatest good to the individual, not
