ling upsct in the on er'rt intramural
baseball by deliver g a death blow
to Rah-son hall’s hopes Tuesdoy,
trouncing its team soundly, 13 to 7.
The Langon attach hopped on Davis,
Raivson pitcher, for five runs in the
first'inuing, and aided by his wild-
ness, and numerous errors in the
Raw-son defense, acquired an early
lead.

When the Rawson players came to
life, it was too late, and altho they
managed to drive in seven runs by
solid hitting, they were too far he-
hind to do any good, Teraberry pitch:
ed excellent ball for four innings, hut
blew Sky high in the fifth and from
then on could not stem the Kelly
Stables attach.

SOCIAL SEASON ls AT ITS
HEIGHT!

Can it be possible that this, another
school year, is so close to an end?
Spring, the beautiful season when
every young man's fancy . . . . and
when parties are in vogue, everyone
is planning some social function to
round out the year’s calendar.

When you look about you and sec
the part that color plays in every»
day life, you gain a greater appreci-
ation of its importance as a factor in
decoration. Automobiles, gasoline,
clothing, merchandise, everything is
more colorful than ever before Color
attracts attention; it helps to mould
impressions; it is symbolic; it is inn
tel-woven with tradition, association
and custom; it is everywhere in na-
ture. Color conveys ideas in much
the same manner as words do.

Do you find it difficult to plan dec-
orations for your party in regard to
arrangement and cost? Social chair-
men have found that Talbott’s Pharms
acy can assist them to make their
parties successful without depleting
their treasury. Bring us your plans
and we will gladly help you to make
yours a best party of the year.

ion of Coach \Villiom Chandler of the
Marquette university cage tcarn.

Under the new tentativc rulc, the
team with tho boll may not retain tho

more than 10 seconds.

The proposed chaugc is being tried
in spring practice at Marquette and
Coach Chandler, as a result, has
formed these opinions:

It will menu a much faster ﬂmc

It will bring about a more sens,»
tionol type of play from the stem

point of the spcctators, with shootrng‘

and high scoring dominating.
It will cause a greater strain upon
the players with the result that there
will be more frequent substitutions,
It will mean that Marquette, at
least, will he one team which will
have to revise its offense and defense
tactics and that a inan-to—mon de-
