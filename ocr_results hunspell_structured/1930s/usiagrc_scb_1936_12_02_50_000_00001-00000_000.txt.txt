Herrick chapel Tuesday evening
under the sponsorship of the mu-
sic recital course, according to
David E. Peck, chairman of the
department of music. The choir
will be under the direction of
Nicolas Afonsky, acclaimed as

leaders.

According to press releases, the
Moscow Cathedral choir has
achieved a unique record of care
rying off first honors in every
choral competition held in Europe
during the last decade.

Mr. Afonsky, a former officer
in the Russian army, chooses his
singers with fastidious care and
spends months in subduing their
voices and individiialities for the
sake of one harmonious whole.
He is a man still in his early
forties. ,

“a chorus must be an entity,"
he declares, “and even in the case
of soloists, oheisance must he
made to the singing of the en-
semble.'

Despite being a strict disciplin-
arian, Mr. Afonsky is beloved by
the members of his organization.
The soloist of the choir is J. Jar-
off, famous Russian baritone.

The concert will he the third
number to be sponsored this year
by the recital course. Earlier in
the year, Bohumil' Kryl and his
symphony orchestra appeared in

Critic Pleased
With Huffman ’s
Song Recital

By Elbert DI. Smith

The 1936-37 Season of Grinnell
faculty concerts was delightfully
ushered in Tuesday evening as
F. “falter Huffman, tellol', ace
companied at the piano by Miss
Sarah Inness MacDonald, appeared
in Herrick chapel in a Song recital
of unusual Variety and charm.

From the lilting simplicity of
“Phillis has such Charming
Graces" to the passionate grand-
eur of the Aria from “Pdgliacci”
Mr. Huffman displayed a clarity
and sweetness of tone together-
with a fluency and penetration of
interpretation which pleased an
audiencc seated too far back to
make an artist feel completely at
ease.

Especially interesting were the
groups of French and German
Songs in which the soloist demons
strated his linguistic ability to ex-
cellent advantage. “Old Mother
Hubbard," in the manner of Han.
del, broke the spell of unwarrant-
ed seriousness so noticeable on
the part of the audience through-
out the first four groups, and
evoked smiles and chuckles of
'ynirth.

Miss MacDonald’s sympathetic
acompanimellts provided an ex—
cellent background for a voice
which brought to its. listeners an
evening of wholly satisfying mue
sic.

Coach Drills Pioneers
for Contest Monday
at Cedar Falls

(By Wells Barnett)

Aided materially by double
practice sessions last week, the
Grinnell cage squad is slowly
rounding into shape for its open»
ing game with Iowa state Teach-
ers quintet next Monday at Cedar
Falls. Twenty candidates report»
ed for the opening practice, in-
cluding three lettermen from last
year's squad, Co-captains tlames
LaMasney and Hal Dean, and Bill
Fowler.

Coach John C. Truesdale Tues
day commented on the wealth of
material from which he must
mold his team and the difficulty
of choosing a travelling squad
from among the twenty men, each
of whom has some particular
specialty.

Begin to Show Form

Coach Tiuesdale also indicated
the manner in which the men
wer lining up for some of the
posi one. "At the present time,"
he stated, "Dean, Berry and Fawn
ler have the edge on the guard
positions, with Luick lookingbest
at center. However, because of
Liiick's weight, he will need a
capable replacement.

If the guards are well taken
care of, according to Truesdale,
Berry, who has also looked im-
pressive in practice as a center,
will he moved to that position
when Luick nccds replacement.
Joe Woodward is also a strong
contender for the center position,
as are Hayward and Barker. Corr
nisli, one of the new junior college
men, would probably be among
the first two or three centers,
Ti-iiesrlalc believes, but there is
some question as to his eligibility.

Possible Forwards

At the forwards LaMasney, and
Sampson now are the best possi-
bilitics, according to Trucsdale,
with Luther and Robinson, Sophos
mores, strong contenders There
is always a strong possibility too.

found capable of handling the

The painting of young corn is

the growth ot,corn, “Stone City"
has for its theme a “ghost town“
northeast of Cedar Rapids. Fifty
years ago it was a booming quar-
ry town, but today, following the
introduction of Portland -cement,
the quarries lie idle and a few
stone buildings are all that re-
main of a once flourishing commu—
nity. The painting looks from one
high bank of the Wapsipinicon
river across to French ridge. In
the valley helow are the old stone
general store and post office, the
hridge, the church. a few houses,
