OLD-WORLD SPORTS

Students at the University of Heidelberg are
happy—for tllc Hitler govcrlllllent has restorcd
their cherished privilege of dueling. Beginning
this week, a duel a day has been held at. the 300-
year lfi Tun Gasthaus auf der Hirschgasse. Will—
dow displays at the university balldagist’s shop
include besides a portrait of Chancellor Hitler,
a huge photograph of a dueling scene, flanked by
two sabers, and a window full of boxes, ban~
dagcs, lint, surgical needles, and disinfectants.

In addition to a heart protector and steel spec-
tacles, combatants near a leather apron to protect
the clothes from blood, Rapiers aro unpointcd
and sharpened only for the last ten inches of the
blade, but according to a special New York Times
story, “can lay hare muscles and nerves and cut
through the belles of the. face and head.” Duels
start at 5:30 a. in. and may continue until 10 a.
lil., when they are ended by the doc ioll of some
senior student or of the surgeons who then pro-
ceed to patch up the wounds.

We have no facetious remarks to make about
dueling as it SDO‘l‘lr. It probably has its good points
W110 plln intended. However, American students
have been taunted for some years for their alleged
baTllEll'lSDl, and lack of old-world refinement and
culture. We have had continental students and
continental study methods thrown up before us as
ideals ever since we first donned prep caps.

So come on, you football players, let’s see some
spikes in your helmets; let’s have barbed shafts ill
the it ' ing ends of paddles, and let's substitute
bull-balling for bull-batting on the ii of illtrae
mural sports. Surely, as old-world students lead,
American students should follow.

THE TENNIS SITUATION

Many men who have seriously desired to play
tennis this spring have almost given up hope, clue
to inability to obtain a place to play. With only
three men’s courts available for a community of
several hundred men, at least half of whom play
tennis, lucky indeed are the pla ’ers who succeed
in getting a court. As lnally players as possible are
accommodated by “doubles” arrangements;
groups stand around for hours in hope of obtain-
illg a vacated court—while the majority of would
he players vicw the crowded courts from their wine
dows and then give up in despair.

Utilization of the space for the fourth nlen’s
court would help relieve the situation to some ex-
tent, but unless there is a change ill the attitude
of the players who are lucky enough to secure
courts, little would be accomplished by that means.
Once obtained, a court is seldom given up until the
players are too tired to continue; for the difficul-
ties in securing the court are so great that players
use them as long as possible, not knowing when
they will get to play again. Meanwhile the waiting

.lgcd and postpone their lilatcllrs ullti . later date.

Probably the best way to lllllkc tennis po. iblc
for all men would be tllc plll llg of all hour limit
upon po ‘5 ssion of courts as is done on some pub-
lic courts in larger l‘lilC. Players are rcquircd to

SIEGMUND FREUD

No doubt one of the most outstanding Cnllll‘llP
llliolls lo lllodcrll knowledge has been made by
Sicglunllll Fl'(‘\\(l. Psychoanalysis is as important
to psycholog‘} mid philosoth, as is the relativity
thcor of Einstein ph ' What is lllorc, ps .ho~
anal) has taken its rightful place ill medicine,
as a means of treating the mentally abnormal, and
the sufferers of tho sorcalled llel‘l'ous diseases.

But whereas Einstein hurts no one ' feelings,
and is safely lhcorctitdl, Freud is dealt billy prac-
tical, and concerns himself with tho most personal
and private affairs of men. That is why he hold
at arm 5 length even in college classrooms. And
that is why. ill this enlightened year, l033, the vi-
tal theories of Siogluund Freud are little discussed
and therefore little known.

Although he writes in German, Freud writes
so simply and with so much human understanding,
that the translations of his works into English
have proved remarkably easy and stimulating
reading. His “Introduction to Psychoanalysis"
can be read with much benefit by the average lay-
man. It is an esscntizll book to the student who is
intellectually alil'c,

‘HERETIC HUTCHINS
(USO. Daily Trojan)

”I am a heretio on admission requirements. If I
had my way, I would admit any student who could
read and write and was recommended by a. reputable
person.”

Thus did Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of
the University of Chicago and an expert at the business
of being different, launch an attack on entrance re-
quirements and grading systems before the annual con-
vention of the American Association of Collegiate
Registrars.

His broadside on the subject of grades was as typi-
cal as bis opinion of entrance requirements.

“The only utility for grades at the University of
Chicago is for transfer purposes as an accommodation
to other institutions which are not as enlightened as
we are," be said, as the visiting registrars listened in
open-mouthed silence.

This brings up the question as to whether class
attendance is any standard by which a student's com-
prehension of the course may be judged. Instructors
are not unknown who deny a grade to anyone who cuts
a class a certain number of times, regardless of the
skill with which he passes the final examination. This
has always seemed oldrfashioned to us, inasmuch as
we feel that students do not come to college to furnish
statistics for the registrar’s office, but to acquire an
education, and if it is possible to learn to think Without
attending class. then the student should not be penal-
ized. If on the other hand absence from class has been
detrimental, this will be brought out in the final exam-
ination anyway, so why be diligent about-keeping ab-
sence records?

JIG-SAW FANS’DIORONS
(Washington Student Lite)

Professor Charles G. Show of New York university
is the philosopher who declared last. year that whistling
was an occupation indulged in only by morons. thereby
gaining for himself a pretty chunk of publicity. This
year, Professor Show has gone further; be relegates
the jig-saw puzzle fan to the moronic category.

An Eastern college paper lists a number of rea-
sons for the jig-Saw puzzle craze. According to psy-
chologists, the puzzles appeal to the fundamental urge
to finish what one begins. This sounds plausible enough;
but why should anyone want to begin on a jigsaw in
the first place? Artists assert that it appeals to the
creative instinct—giving form and meaning to what is
inchoate. But this inebonte state is merely transferred
from the puzzle to the addiot’s mind. The true fan who
scorns to keep the picture before him as a guide says
he is tempted by the ”mysterious challenge of the un-
known."

Might we suggest another matter to the professor
to be relegated to moronic mentalities? And that is
the pastime of declaring popular entertainments mor-
onicia pastime indulged in by certain educators merely
by Way of making a. pass at that elusive lady, Miss
Publicity.

Editor,

The Scarlet and Black.

Dear sir:

After reading the editorial publish-
ed in last Saturday's issue of The
Scarlet and Block concerning meal
charges for guests. we feel that some
thing else should be called to the ab
tontion of the college. That is the
charge for weekend guests.

Careful track is kept of the guests
entertained in the cottages and of
the students who entertain them.
That is as it should be since we would
certainly not expect to go to a hotel
without paying our room rent. and
no more should we expect to come to
the quadrangle without doing so.
However, it hardly seems just that
an alumnus should be asked to pay
for sleeping quarters that she ooeu-
pies over-nlght. Nor does it seem
fair that parents visiting students
that are in the hospital should he
charged.

There are very few students who
do not leave the school at some tirne
during the school year for which
they have paid room rent. We think

that a. system

 

could be evolved

whereby the strident is permitted to

have guests in accordance with the

number of days for which he has

paid, but for which be is not here.
Sincerely,

Margery Braner
