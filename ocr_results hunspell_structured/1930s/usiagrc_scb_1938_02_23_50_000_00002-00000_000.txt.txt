VITAL TO THE SYSTEM

Because of our proximity to the system and because
of the efficiency with which it works, we sometimes forget
that the system of dormitories and cottages at Gl'lnhell is
unique among institutions of higher education.

Outstanding features in the plan is thelfreedom from
the suggestion of fraternities and sororities, or so at least
we would like to believe. V” at times, many 0f “5 are

guilty of limiting our friendships to those in our own hall
or cottage. We tend to place hall loyalty above loyalty to
the college. All of which are fraternal tendencies. _

NOW we have no particular quarrel with the fraternity
system. We do think, however, that our system is superior,
Therefore it is pleasant to find that steps are being taken to
promote intra-hall contact in the true spirit of the dormitory
system, We speak particularly of the recent men's smokers.
We are thinking also of a recent all-quadrangle party held
in Haines cottage, There probably have been other
examples of the same spirit 4

To them all then, we offer our congratulations, for
these are the things which made the system vital and alive,
at true part of the Grinnell tradition.

A difﬁcult problem prescniedi
itself to Mr, Secor after the reccp- ‘.
tion held in the quadrangle for tho
Irrench speakers last week. After
trying vainly to get the two for-
eigners out of the building befcrc
closing hours, and failing, Secor
,wcnt to great lengths to explain
to the astonished men that the
lg at Grinncll really were from
Vely fine families and that their
3 method of bidding their boy friends
lgoodrnight was accepted in this
country and did not brand them
as aiaﬁ bad.

Apparently, Hayes is still
doubtful of thc quality of Grinhelll
students. ,At least he was check-
ing roll on his class before the‘
Kotschnig lecture hcgon last
night.

The dumbest remark of the
week is attributed to that fresh»
man girl who believed it when
she was told that those queer
things Corns and Tschirley were
wearing on their ears were crys-
tal sets that they listen to when
the class becomes too dull. Actth
ally. they are used to prevent
cauliflower ears.
