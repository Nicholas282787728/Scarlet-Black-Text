My dear President Mai :

simply overwhelmed by the

cordial invitation that I deliver the
commencement address this ye
There are good reasons why I
should not accept, but I cannot be
so ingrate and unappreciative as
to allow timidlty and inertia to
interfere.

So, though with fear and tremb-

opportunity, hoping that in some
way, by some means, I may meas-

have yet attained.
Very truly yours,

a subject I'm very much interested
in,” Professor Norris said when ask-
ed if that subject were his hobby. He
is, however, known to Grinnell
friends both from his speaking and
writing as a philosopher along bio-
logical llnes. '

“A Philosophy of Life," which ap-
peared serially in the September and
November issues of the Tanager,
was an effort to resolve the problems
of reality and mechanism into an i _
tegrity, or unity compatible with
modern science.

Kenneth Clayton, editor of the annual,

'announced this afternoon.

 

'hds heretofore,

Every student may vote for one
college women and one college man,

1 the 1932 Cyclone.

Voters in the race will cast their
ballots at a box to be placed between
the Alumni Recitation hall and the
library, The balloting will be con—
ducted on a different basis than it
each vote being
equal.

In prior ballots the votes of those
who have paid for their annuals have
counted more than those who have
not purchased the yearbook. The
possibility that this did not give a
representative vote has led to the
change this year.

Payne Author of Bulletin

in University Extension
Series for TeachersY Aid

“The teacher of history and Amer-
ican foreign relations" is the subject
of a bulletin written by Charles E.
Payne, professor of history at Grin-
nell college. The bulletin is the thir-
teenth of a series being prepared by
the University of Iowa extension,
dealing with aids for history teachr
ers.

It is believed that this literature
will impress instructors with the fact
that foreign relations may be shaped
by the manner in which history and
current events are taught.

The bulletins are being sent by the
University of Iowa to history teach-
ers and superintendents in Iowa high
schools, and to Iowa public and Col-
lege libraries.

Employment Tips

Employment representatives,
who visit the campus in search of
recruits, are usually interested in
only men of exceptional promise.
As one personnel ofﬁcial said last
year. “We wish to interview only
the upper 10 per cent of your sen~
ior class.“

The majority of college men and
women cannot afford to wait for
a job to come to them, They will
have to go to the employment de—
partments cf the various compan-
ies and make a personal applica-
tion. Frequently openings which
are little advertised offer the larg—

 

est opportunities.

ample. The words of the composi-
tion need not be original. Musical
compositions for instrumental use
may also be submitted.

Graphic Arts Added

The sixth prize, offered for an

is an innovation. This design may
be in any approved form, suitable for
one of many uses. The purposes and
medium of the design have not been
precisely designated, It may be done
either in colors or in black and white.
Because a course in creative art has
been added to the college curriculum,
such a prize was considered pertin-
ent this year by the committee. The
members of the committee are Pro-
fessor Wood, Miss Louisa Sargent,
Prof. John D. Stoops, and Prof. David
E. Peck. All Grinnell students may
