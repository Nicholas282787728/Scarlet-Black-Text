should encourage a continued large attendance on the
part of students. Dr. Brooks approached his subject
with the broad outlook of one who has been receptive
to the latest developments in the fields of reli on and
science. There was no attempt to overlook the growth
away from religion on the part of the younger genera-
tion. Neither was there any attempt to minimize sci-
ence's importance in moulding man's thought. Recogni-
tion and in some measure acceptance of the present
"state of public opinion in regard to religion made what
the lecturer had to say palatable to even those students
classifying themselves as non-religicnists or religious
radical.

The conciliatory approach or the speaker, the inter-
esting theme of his lectures, and the adjustment of
chapel time to meet the convenience of all the students
should allow no excuse for a decrease in attendance

‘ THE GATES LECTURES.

The largest attendance recorded at a chapel ser—
vice this yesr turned out to hear Dr. Raymond c. Brooks,
professor of religion at Pomona college, when he gave
the ﬁrst of a series of Gates lectures Tuesday While
the attendance was undoubtedly swelled by a large
number of ministers attending the Congregational con—
ference, there was no doubt that more students came
than have attended any of the previous chapels.

The large attendance is a tribute to the speaker
who is well known in theological circles, and to the gen—
eral theme of his lectures, which under the comprehen—
sive title of ”The Old Religion In The New World” cov-
ers a. variety of aspects likely to be of vital interest to
thee interested in cultural pursuits, The attitude of the
speaker as revealed in his hrst address, “The Place of

Religion in the Building of Civilization" was one thnl.

nation today and second. because he represents an ecorh
omic philosophy contrary to that held by most Grinnell
students.

Whatever message the famous Socialist brings to
Grinnell. it is sure to be one that will require rapid-ﬁre
thinking on the part of his audience to assimilate all he
Says, for he is an editor and clergyman of no mean re-
putation, whose power to express his economic views in
trencbant style, and in powerful manner is well—known.
That this is true may be inferred by just a fact or two
out of his life: he was editor of that keenly»crltlcal
magazine, the Nation. during 1921 and 1922, and in all
his political campaigns, such as his candidacy for the
presidency in 1925 and for the mayoralty of New York
,last fall, has wan to his support many progressive and
leading thinkers.

What is more importniit, Mr. Thomas' views on the
present economic order will clash strongly with those
of Grinnell students. most of whom are ﬁrm advocates
of the capitalistic syste'm. He will undoubtedly make
a plea for the farmer and laborer here as opposed to
the privileged classes, and all those who want to under-
stand both sides of our present economic shield will ﬁnd
it strongly stimulating to hear Mr. Thomas. We say
"strongly", because his views may even provoke some
feeling in the breasts of devoted advocates of our pre—
sent system, but such a reaction is valuable to the
development of a spirit of understanding of our social
order today.

The YMCA. and Y.W.C.A., under whose auspices
Mr. Thomas is coming here, have warned us in advancg
that those who go to hear him must not expect to see
a demagogue with unshorn locks waving the red hag

around on the pletzorm,‘ though the newspapers of the =

state may play him up as such; rather, the Y's have
suggested what we have tried to point out in this
editorial. that to those who desire to exercise brain-cells
at a more than average rate, Mr. Themes is the men to

hear. Lest We forget, February 27 is the date,

As to the part which religion can

do for civilization, Dr. Brooks said,
“Religion can give an outlook beyond
the material things of life, it can give
insight into the spirit of God, it can
give fellowship of those who love
truth and follow goodness, and it can
lead to an understanding of human
life as the focal point of the eternity.

Campus Opinion

Question: What do you think of
the idea that a student should spend
two years at a small hberal arts col-
lege and then two years at a large
university?

Blanche Hulsabus—lf you can’t go

‘ more than four years and want the

experience. changing is a good idea,
but it takes more than two years to
become really part of an institution.

Harold Forrester~1 think it is best
to decide what you want the ﬁrst
two years and specialize the last
two.

mm... Johnsnnilf you want
technical training, it’s a good idea to
have two years at a university. But
for a liberal arts education, there's
nothing better in the Middle West
than a. Small college like Grinnell.

Edward Brown~1 think it's all
right if you don’t get so tond of the
small college you hate to leave.

Contrasts Inn/In and Greek
Contrasting the Latin mind with
the Greek, Dr. Brooks illustrated his
thesis, which was the point of con-

thought through the centuries.
great task," Stated the speaker, "is
to deliver Christianity from its bond-
age to the Latin mind and to furnish
a new mold in which it can function."
“The Latin mind was external and
dogmatic, while the Greek mind was
mystic and idealistic. The Greek
thought of God in terms of immim
ence, feeling that we are in God's
presence constantly. The kingdom
of God is within, was the Greek be-
lief. The Latin mind thought of God
as transcendent, dwelling in a place
apart. When we die, we see God. the
infinite King and Sovereign.

“The Greek mind thought of
Christ’s coming as God’s plan of ac—
tion come in the flesh to enlighten
man's confused mind, Christ is al—
ways present in the human soul and
He is waiting to be released. The
Roman mind thought that Christ

thought, however, that salvation is a

spirit. The Roman mind believed that
