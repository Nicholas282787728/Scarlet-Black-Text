‘Of the many brilliant. men whonl Grinnell stns

college students than Reinhold Niehuhr.

Ilarry F. \\‘ar,d was distinguished by a militant. so-

eueed or too isolated to share

No alert student, horror ', in tail to he capti-
vated hr the acute vi nal thinl ng of Dr. Niebnllr,
[or thinking is the lust interest. of a college. The
title of one of his recent books. “The Notebook or:
a Tamed Cynic,” signifies the, fact that Dr. Nie-
huhr has not arrived at his present oredio by the
regulation paths of piety. He is gifted ill combin-
lug thoughts in new \\'a s. in the light of soci l and
economic cxpericu . n example of the nu} '

Their attitude is not a question of loyalty

Disintcrcst Solution

“Disintcrestedness in personal gain
would solve world problems of today,"
he went on. "The Christian ethic of
lovc has always been a little outside
of human history and continues so.
however. Disinterested love is im-
possible to attain but it is also im-
possible to disavow.

“The strong, powerful man must
be held back in society by non-violent
coercion. It. is easy enough to see
which group is right if we define the
goal of the Christian ethic as social
equality."
