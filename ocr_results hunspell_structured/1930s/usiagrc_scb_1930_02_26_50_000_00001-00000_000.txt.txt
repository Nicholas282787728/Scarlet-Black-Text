Will Strive to

Pioneers, Indoor Champs,

Enter Valley Meet
Saturday.

Contest Is all Drake

Oklahoma, and Drake Expected
to Make Strong Bids

for 1930 Honors.

March 1 has seldom been lauded
as a memorable date. In fact even
the ground hog spurns it. Probably
few students can recall any mention
of it in their background of studies
except for the old “in likA a lamb
and out like a, lion” hold over. March
1 of 1930 means that for the first
time in a year, Grinnell college will
be Called upon to defend her Mis-
sourl Valley indoor track cham-
pionship honors at the Drake field
house.

At the outset, Coach Duke is is
bit pessimistic over, the outlook.
Advance reports show no exceptional
power at Washington or Creighton
and tend to make the affair a th‘ee
cornered tangle with Drake, Grin-
hell and the Oklahoma Aggics pur-
ticipsting. This has little signifi-
cance unless one peruses the score
sheets it hit more closely.

Drckc May Win

Drake will make her bid for first
honors in the hurdles and sprints.
The Pioneer mentor is hoping for
men from Creighton and Washington
to cut down Bulldog points in these
events. On top of these Drake
should rate a few points in the pole
vault, broad jump and shot put.

Grinnell’s power lies in her dis-
mnce men. Captain Mark, Pelletler,
H. Edwards, Murphy, Carley, Secor.
McKenzie, Mcllrath and Pye are all
distance men likely to pick up
points in any meet. The dismal
news comes in the fact that the Ok-
lahoma Aggies also are relying on
distance men to put them in front.
’Unless one team has an outstanding
set of runners it seems likely that
'they will combat each other and
permit Drake to slip out with the
bacon.

Aggies’ Runners strong

Coach Wash Kenny of the Okla-
homa 'Aggics is bring Clarence
Burch, Ray Stockton and Bob Cale
hown as veteran mllers and John
Collins end Alvin Jenkins, a pair of
sophomores, to the meet. These dis-
tance men are among the best in
the loop cnd in addition he still has
Ray mond Adair, conference half
mile champion whose time over the
880 is 1:57. The veteran Aggie
hurdlel', Best, is not in action this
season, but Kenny boasts a sopho—
more, Elwell Rutledge, who may
place. Rutledge is also is quarter
milel' and Hugh Frizell and Forrest
Chauncey will probably run the
shorter sprints and the quarter mile
for the southemers.

Snorf is Drake's big bet in the
hurdles and the sprints with Iidns~
rude doped to take the pole vuult.
Grinnell can hope for points in the
vault, however, a. few in the hurdles,
and except for these must depend
on the four distance runs. The
Grinnell mile relay team should cop
however. The fact that Douglas
will he in Oklahoma with the cage
team will help to cut down Grinnell’a
chances of taking the affair.

Couch Issues Football
Call for Early Workouts

All Grinnell College football can-
didates are to report to Coach L. L.
Watt at the men's gymnasium of
4:30 Thursday afternoon. The men
tor plans to get part of the three
weeks of spring football out of the
way in March and will line up his
candidates at this meeting. He may
start regular workouts Monday if
the weather permits,

Majority of Students

Are Indifferent

to Chapel Service, Student Poll Shows

The chapel service no longer holds
an important place in the lives of
most Grinnell students, if the results
of the poll conducted by the Scarlet
and Black during the past week are
any ludiostlon of the nttitudc of the
students toward this service. This
was indicated. not so much by the
ballots which were cast, but by the
lack of even a great deal of interest
in the poll, as less than ten per
cent of the student body took the
trouble to register their opinions on
the subject. An editorial in today's
Scarlet and Black presents a further

‘analysis of the poll.

Of those who voted, the great ma-
jority favored continuing the service
at the present 8 o'clock hour. while
a few favored the suggested hour of
12 o'clock, This would seem to in-
dicate that, to those who do attend
chapel, the present hour is sctis‘fac—

Lantern at Work

to Obtain Outside
Telephone Lines

The possibility of placing in each
building a. telephone which will be
connected with the town central all
night was the principal point con~
sidered at the Lantern meeting
which was held last Wednesday cve—
ning in Building Three club room.
It hss been felt that valuable mcs-
sagas over long distance as well as
telegraph messages are often delay-
ed in the closing of the college cen-
tral between 10:30 p. m. and 7 no u.
m.

Whether or not the reading rooms
in the library should be opened on
Sunday afternoons was also consid-
ered. One of the members reported
that the librarian felt it undesir-

able in that it would break up the:

present reserve book system by
causing all such books to he return—
ed for the afternoon session, and that
it was doubtful if enough students
would take advantage of the Sunday
hours to make the opening Worth
while. Arrangements were com»
pleted whereby students might enter
the stack rooms if they have the
permit of one of Lhe faculty. This
will benefit the slower students and
those who are working on sp val
reports. A further announcement of
this system will be made through the
Scarlet and Black when it‘hecomes
effective,

Cosmos Club Picks
Sneedas President

Richard Sliced was elected pres-
ident of the Grinneli chapter of
Corda Fratres last night at a busi-
ness meeting following a. talk on Ha-
wall by Miss Isabelle Clark. Five
other new officers were also elected.

In the vice-presidency, Myrna. Ad-
ams succeeds Aloha Studier; Ro-
berts Vsnce succeeds Ruth Stewart
as secretary; the vacancy in the
treasurership left by Sneed's promoA
tion is filled by Hubert Pye; Ruth
Arnold is the social chairman to
replace Reba Jordan; and Alfred
Conard, retiring chapter editor. is
replaced by Jana Lewis. The ‘rctir-
ing president is John Elsen.

The incoming president, besides
serving an apprenticeship as irreasurs
er, is experienced in varsity debate
and as president of thc cub-presch-
ers‘ club.

Miss Cisrkc, Wlio spent the past
year on leave from the Grinnell lib—
rary to do work in Hawaii, reported
very favorable impressions of the
islands. She spoke of the brilliant
colors of Lhe vegetation, by which
one is immeditcly impressed, and
displayed a number of colored pic-
tures which she stated were not in
the least exaggerated. The even cli-
mate, the cleanliness of the people
and th cities, the constant sea
breeze, and the scenery on Kilauea
all received the speaker's praise.

The food only, excited her anti-
pathy. She mentioned a delicacy
which “looked like library paste, and
tasted like library phstc probably "if
it soured."

Among the problems which con-
front modern Hawaii, Miss Clarke
mentioned race relations, which how-
ever she found surprisingly satisfac-
tory, and the second generation
problem, The latter concerns young
Hawaiians with too much education
to return to the lives of their par-
ents, yet with the field of profes-
Sional work already oversupplled.

, More Men vim.-

An interesting feature of the poll
was the fact that it aroused much
more interest at the dorms than at
the quadrangle. nearly twice as
many men at the dorms casting
votes as did women at the quad.
Town men and women showed about
equal interest in the investigation.

Suggestions for change in the
Chapel programs were quite numer-
ouS, most of them requesting "more
music" One person suggested that
in view of the small attendance,
"everyone ought to sit together in
front," While others urged "previous~
ly announced programs, “more in
formal talks," ”student programs,”
“spoken, not read talks,” and "more
varied speeches.’

But the dominant tone left by the
poll was that, somehow in the past
few years, the chapel service has
lost the interest of the vast major-
ity of the students,

Pioneers Rbmp

at Drake Meet

Slam Four Events to Down
Bulldog Trackan
67 1-3 to 36 2-3.

Scoring slams in the 440, 330, mile
and two mile runs, the Plonecrtrsck-
men pulled it real sleeper over the
Drake hopefuls at Des Moines Salt-
urday to romp away with the top
mark in the 67 1-3 to 36 2-3 dual
meet, Coach G. L. Duke's predic-
tions that he would have a squad
which would show power in the dis-
tcnces were borne out in this tangle.

Coach Pitch Johnson’s Bulldogs
held almost even with me Pioneers
in the matter of ﬁrst places, taking
five to Grinnell‘s six, but they drop-
ped behind on seconds and thirds.
The big thrill of the afternoon came
in the 50 yard high hurdles, when
Hensley nosed out Snorf and Podre~
barac of Drake by doing Lhe distance
in :07. The judges were disagreed
on the winner but ﬁnally gave the
Pioneer runner credit for breaking
the tape.

Four Records Broken

Four meet records were cracked
during the afternoon’s performances.
Lloyd Lansrudc, Drake pole vaulter
clcsrcd the bar at 12 feet to better
the old mcct record of 11 feet 6
inches. Harold McMichacl sent the
shot through the air for 39 feet 6%
inches to set a new mark in the shot
put. Murphy, new Pioneer half

oklcb ma Aggics on Friday night.
Satur by night they go to Tulsa
where‘they meet the Tulsa univer-
sity cagers.

Grinnell is doped to take the mar-
gin in' both games, despite the fact
that Coach Truesdale looks for the
Aggies to win at least one confer-
ence game this season. The Pio-
neers easily overcame the southern-
crs here Jan. 31 and need another,’
win to get a. prospective tie for third
place in the Missouri Valley confer-
ence. The Crinucll record now,
stands with five victories in 13
games. Two more wins would;
make it seven in fifteen for a fair,
record. The dismal earlier showing,
the Pioneers has been ranked infer-‘
ior hy‘ the superior showing of the
squad during the past month, when
they have taken three of five games
and lost the other two by only very
close margins. The Aggies were
the first to meet the rejuvenated
Pioneers at the end of January and_
know that they will be up against a'
fighting aggregation. They were uh-
able to combat the Grinnell defense
at that time, however, and lost, 19
to 10. The game with Tulsa univer»,
sity Saturday will he the first stirs,
lctic contest between the two
two schools. Tulsa has seldom
played teams of Missouri Valley con»
ference Class but is making a strong
bid to win a place in speedier compe-‘
tition. l

About three hundred quadrangle
girls, in the style of George and
Martha Washingtcus, swept up and
down a. Colonial garden Saturday
night at the annual Colonicl ball
given by thc W.A,A. board at the
men's gymnasium. At one end of
the room a fountain shot sparkling
jets of water into c pool bordered
by ferns and rocks, cherry trees in
blossom and green tree-branches
stood cgainst lattice-work Cupolas:
a halfmcon hung in the southeast
corner; and stars glittered from lit-
tle lights beneath the rafters. The
white—pillcred porch of an old colo»
nial mansion was the shelter for an
orchestra, while at the door, honored
guests were received and announced
in all pcmpousness by c negro ser»

Tanksters to Meet
Iowa State Squad

Grinnell's swimmers, having lost to
the Missouri Valley conference
champs last week, will take on an—
other formidable foe this week in
the lows Ststc tankmen, Big Six
Litlc holders. The meet is scheduled
for 2:30 Saturday aflsrncon in the
local pool.

The lows State team seems to be
pointing for a second title this sea:
son with Unser, star hundred man,
doing his distance in :61 240 and
s crack diver who won the Big Six
event last season. Thomas is like
ly to take points in the back stroke,
however, Dehong is coming right
along in the breast stroke event and
Miller looks like real class in the
440 yard free style. it these men
come through as they are expected
to it will mean that Grinnell will
have a chance to give the visitors s
run for victory at any rate,

Summer School

stenography and typewriting at the
Grinncll high school, will conduct

Intermission was featured by the
sedate measures of Mozart's Minuet
