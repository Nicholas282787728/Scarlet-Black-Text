Physics Department Prepares Exhibits
for ‘Gigantic’ Show Friday Evening

Affair to Run Continuously
from 7:30-11 o’Clock

By Eu gene “'ood

Friday night will feature the physV
ics “open house" to ho hold in Good-
now hall.

For the past few weeks Grant 0.
Gale, head of the physics department,
D. A. Wilbur, physics instructor,
David Boir, graduate assistant and
members of the physics classes have
hcen preparing various demonstra-
tions which will be exhibited that
evening.

Coiiuiiemorates A uiii-ci-snry

This ”open liollse" which will begin
at 7.30 pm. and continue until 11
pan. commemorates the fortietli
anniversary of the founding of the
physics department.

The Pontiac chassis, which was ob-
tained from General Motoi’s, has been
thoroughly polished by Ivan palmer,
.but he has been forbidden to demon
strate his sales talk or take orders
for Pontiac dealers.

An interesting group of exhihits
depicting the work of to years ago,
will include a picture of the faculty

aken in 1893 and shown that sum-
mer at the Chicago World's Fair. H
W. Norris, research professor of 20»
ology is the only member of the
group still actively teaching.
Demonstrate Electric Eye

One of the most interesting demon-
strations will he the photoelectric
cell, popularly known as the “electric
eye". This is one of the most recent
developments of physics. A group of
exhibits on the first floor will show
the varieol applications of this cell,
such as transmission of sound over a
ray of light and the automatic con-
trol of appliances and machinery.

In the Chicago theatre the theory
of the photo-electric cell is applied
to operate drinking fountains. When
a person stoops over to drink a ray
of light from the cell is cut off and
the water is automatically turned
on. some of the modern burglar
.larms also function on this princis
ple.

Persons interested in clocks and
phonographs will have the opportun-
ity of seeing several rare representa-
tives of this group. A Seth Thomas

on exhihit. This time picce won first
prize at the Philadelphia Exposition
in 1876 and was donated to the col-
lose in 'ss. An old cylinder type
phonograph will also be ex hitcd.
Display Telephone Ilrirts

The telephone appears to bc a sim-
ple, reliohle device, hut 201 parts go
into its construction, A demonstra-
tion hoard received from the North-
wet-tern Bell Telephone company will
display all of these parts on the secs
oiid fioor of Goodnow hall.

The Bell Telephone laboratories re-
cently discovered that it has in
its museum a device which is sup;
posed to he the original Morse Telcs
graph recorder. The criiinell pllyss

1le recorder and it will he on ex-

it irriday evening.

A complete list of all the demon-
stiarions and the students who will
explain them is as follows. First floor:
Pontiac chassis, ivan and Keith Pal-‘
mer; \lsible sound waves, Ore Lu ‘
