Defeated at Relays

afternoon program of .the Drake re—
lays in Des Moines. Walter Secor
ran the two-mile and a four-mile re-
lay team, composed of Richard Mur-
phy, Duncan McKenzie, Huburt Pye
and Howard McIlrath, took part in
the distance relay.

Secor found the competition stiff
and took eighteenth out of a field
of nineteen two-mile runners. The
four-mile relay ﬁnished next to last,
the ﬁnal place being taken by the
University of Iowa, ‘

Murphy made a brilliant sprlnt at
the ﬁnish of his mile in the ﬁrst of
the four-mile event Saturday, and
gave Grinnell fourth place at the
start of the second stanza. Mc-
Kenzie found competition keen and
was not able to hold the fourth posi-
tion. Pye missed count on the laps
and ﬁnished the fourth round of the
third mile with much difficulty.
Monrath took the baton for the last
mile and let the Iowa representative
set the pace until the last half of
the ﬁnal lap, when he staged his
“poetry" stride and ran away from
the Hawkeye participant.
