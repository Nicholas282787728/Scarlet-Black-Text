STUDENTS AND POLITICS

This weekend, delegates from ,11 colleges and
universities of thc state will attend Grinncll’s sco-
ond annual conference on International Relations.
Plans include addresses by several of the country ‘s
leading economists and educators.

There arc those wllo would scoff at the idca
of college students in one small state holding it coli-
fercnce to consider the subject of international
relations. With political intrigue growing stronger
in leading nations, with economic upheavals all
over the world, alld with the world‘s lmding
statesmen puzzled over the situation. what elm he
accnlnplisllcd, they ask, by a handful of college
students who know nothing of the practicalities
and disillusionments of the universe? Their ques-
tion answers itself.

It is true that these students know very little,
comparatively speaking, of international affairs.
However—they are meeting for the purpose of
learning something about the world and its poli-
tics. Speakers who will address them know of what
they are talking. Discussion in a convclltionicvcu
by these so-callcd impractical Slll(lCl]lS#l)l'ingS
clarity to a situation. Delegates hcconlc illtt-r-
nationally minded, and in turn their schools and
their associates absorb some of the spirit.

Perhaps it is only a small drop ill a llllg‘t‘
bucket, hut student . Throughout the history of,
nations. have led political lllovoittcnts. The, lunvlilm
picture idea of the Allioricau college student, with
his extreme garb, outlandish vocabulary and (‘llllie
ty head, has been relegated to the SCl'ﬂDllK‘aD. .\
conference on international relations, even ill this
small corner of the world, and attended by a low
students, is a strong movement in the right di-
rcctioll.

"PRU'DITIES" AGAIN

Again we call attention to the fact that plans
for next year’s Pioneer Pl‘lltllties should llc madc
now if tllc rcvuc is to be presented at that time.
A place on the college calendar, details of the Vi
ious acts, and contest rules should be arranged l)0-
fore it is too late to give them their due consider
ation.

Sentiment on the campus seems to be in favor
of reviving the Prudities next year, and giving the
matter all holiest “break” this time. While no
social flulclion is a life and death matter, with so
many more serious tllings'to consider at the pres»
ent time, there is a need, we believe, for all all~
college stage presentation of this type,

The argument that “there are too many out
side activities now,” ha been heard. There is
no reason why the Prud as should not take the
place of some activities which do not have the same
all-college appeal. Instead of a play in which only
a limited number of drama and play production
students take part, the Pruditics give an oppor~
tunity to all the dormant talent of the school. In
stead of a woman’s intramural (lance contest,
these dances could be worked out in better shape
for the Prnditics, And soGon.

UNEMPLOYED GRADUATES

A handful of unemployed college graduates,
who hope to increase their number to 10,000, has
recently organized to form the Association of Ulla
employed College Alumni, in hopes that they may
be rlblc to do something about their condition. lll~
eluded among those former students are wouldrhc
doctors, lawyers, alld engineers, who have diplo-
luas, but nothing else.

The group, numbering but a few hundred at
present, intends to try to influence social leng'
lotion, to win industrialists over to a program ol‘
planned industry, to gain unemployment insurance,
to force the government to provide WOT , rather
than charity.

Joseph P. Lash, who received his Masters dce
grcc from Columbia last year and was also one of
the editors of “The Student Outlook’ there, is
chairman of the executive committee. Other spona
sors include John Dewey, noted philosopher, Rein-
hold Nicbnhr, of the Union Theological Scmina'
New York, and Norman Thomas, socialist candi-

INTEGRATION OF COURSES?
(Bron-n Herold)

“Greater integration of courses is the keynote of
the Daily Princeton in a series of editorials discussing
the curriculum at Princeton. In order to attain sueh
integration, cites one of these editorials, the freshman
should at the very beginning of his year "decide both
the general outlines of the body of knowledge which he
hopes to acquire, and what individual courses he should
take to fill them in,” Such comment is most interesting
for those who are attempting to make their four years
as practical a preparation for later pursuits as is feas-
ible.

“The best the admi stration can do, perhaps, is to
encourage freshman advisers to point out the great
advantages of planning the whole of one's curricular
activities," suggests the Princetoniah. But the diffi—
culty of such a step is concealed in admission that
“the great majority of freshmen probably have only the
vagest idea of what they want to get out of college.
This situation is so‘serious that it often extends well
into the junior year, and, we regret to state, sometimes
to the day that our erstwhile freshman is standing on
the platform to receive his degree and the handshake
of the president.

For such a reason, we are in favor of the plan that
is accepted hereinot allowing the freshman to take any
definite steps towards specialization in any particular
field until his junior year. We feel that the last two
years give the student ample opportunity to delve
as deeply as he likes in a subject which has been de-
cided upon after a taste of everything. Immediate "ii-its»
gretion of courses” upon arrival at college in the fresh-
man year threatens the wide general knowledge which
is just as significant a result of four year's training
as well—grounded knowledge in any one field. Further—
more, courses which the freshman might not be willing
to take because he or his adviser might deem them
extraneous to the main interest might quite probably
be of more value than was originally thought. How
was it to be anticipated for instance, that an aspect of
a psychology course might help one who is doing work
in England? Yet, how frequently we who are juniors
and seniors are able to attach more significance to a
fact that was unexpectedly dealt nitli in one of those
“dreaded" required courses of our freshman and sopho-
more years. \

There is still another reason why we favor the
comparatively random selection of courses in our fresh»
man years, if a man happens to be language-minded,
nothing will help him more than a grapple with some
scientific course that invites an entirely different means
of attack from anything he has been accustomed to
offer. He will approach his languages with a more ma—
tum and sophisticated attitude, having been trained to
force himself to think along lines that do not offer the
degree of least resistance.

In view of such factors in the modern curricular
program, much as we approve of Princeton's attempt
to aim at a greater integration of courses, we cannot
countenance such integration before the freshman has
bad a chance to become acquainted with all sides of
the question.

G—

PUTTING HONOR IN THE HONQR SYSTEM
(The ondland)

Proximity of the nine weeks’ examinations makes
timely once again the question of the honor system.
Has the honor system in American colleges broken
down? Regretfully it must be admitted that it has.
Then what, it may be asked, is the presert need to
remedy the deficiency?

The goal of any honor system is not primarily to
control cheating, but rather to build the spirit of honor.
Failure to realize this end is the key to the existing
condition.

Such a goal is realized only by the process of de-
velopmeutigradual and slow, and not at all analogous
to the setting up of an electric radio where by swiftly
plugging in wrres, flipping a control button and twisting
a dial perfect reception is attained instantly.

Moreover, such development must be founded on a
number of prerequisite essentials conducive to the func-
tioning of the honor system.

A student body that is morally and intellectually
worthy of a college education is the initial need. This
would call for a. careful sifting of the chaff from the
Wheatia careful Examination of the precollcge histor-
ies of prospective students and a courageous determiua~
tion to sacrifice quantity for quality.

Going hand in hand with this requisite is that for
a student body that is serious in its purpose. Again
quantity must be sacrificed for quality. The discovery
and elimination or reform of lazy students would have
to be effected early in each college year.

Thus it may be seen that a college’s faculty must
play a leading role in huilding‘ up a new morale and
spirit of honor. The faculty's part. however, can not
end with the elimination of those unfit for college.
Every college should demand that its instructors have
masters degrees in the knowledge of youth as well as
in their respective instructive courses. A facility, which
because of this knowledge, has such sympathy for and
confidence in youth as to be trustful rather than sus~
picious in dealing with it, is vastly important.
