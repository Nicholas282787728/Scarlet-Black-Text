dates for a possible kicker.

Editorials Offer Students’ Views
.of Compulsory Cyclone Question

Scurlcl eml Blaclg h prolohlns no or order
lllal mule":s may be goal. a [air vial» of
bulb sidci o/ the question.

The strident referendum which will
be taken Thursday n ght on the pro-
posed plan of placing tho Cyclone,
Grinnell college ycsrbook, on the Se-
mester fee at a reduced rate is one
which effects not only every student
on the campus, but all those inter
ested in Grinnell. The Cyclone, which
is in truth a pictorial representation
of the college year, is a permanent
record which will exist for years to
come as a story of the year 1931-32
in Grinnell. Every student and alum-
nus wants a year book of which he
can be proud. During the last few
years the problems of circulation and
advertising have become more diffi-
cult for the annual staffs to solve.
This is especially true of small col-
leges where advertising and circula-
tion possibilities are limited.

The present Cyclone staffs are
faced wth the fact that last year's
annual, the 1932 Cyclone, is still in
debt, This deficit may be attributed
to mismanagement or misunder-
standing. This year conditions in gel-ls
eral are no better; in fact they are
probably worse,

An almost double guaranteed cire
culation would carry a good deal of
weight with annual advertisers, the
majority of which consider yearbook
advertising as nothing more than
good will. If the advertisers can be

guaranteed that the book will be in.

the hands of every student, the ad
is Worth several times more to him
than if the yearbook had no definite
circulation.

Although administrative officials
of the college have met with the Cye
clone heads and given their approval
of the new plan and the money would
necessarily go through the office of
the college treasurer, both the edi~
torial and business Staff Will continue
to be headed by students and the
book will continue to be put out pure—
ly on student initiative.

Students would have nothing to
lose and much to gain by accepting
the new plan, and Grinnell colege
would he assured of a yearbook
which is up to par in a year when
nearly everything is taking a plunge.
Guaranteed circulation is almost
necessary to the life of the annual
which could not for the honor of the
school run another year on a deficit.

At present 232 books have been
sold, which figure represents 44% of
the residents of the quadrangle and
dormitories. The subscriptions sold
to residents in town have not reach-
ed 10%. A large majority of the re-
maining 66% and 90% would pur-
chase a book at a price lower
than 35. A fee of 53 paid at the
beginning of the second semester by
cvery Grinnell student would guar-
antee a year book of the same qual-
ity of last year's at a 52 reduction.
Three dollars more or less, when col-
lege bills are being paid, is o more
drop in the bucket, but so
taken from a monthly allowance
cripples a budget, If the vote carries,
all funds collected in the fall cam-
paign will be refunded in cash. Next
year if such a plan, proves a success
5150 could be charged each semes-
ter. In case there are brothers and
sisters in school only one annual
might be sold to a family.

,This new plan insures a better
book at less money by a more equal
division of monetary responsibility.

students will be given an oppor-
tunity at house meetings tomorrow
night to vote in a student referendum
which will decide whether or not the
Cyclone, Grinnell college yearbook,
should he placed on the semester
fee. in other words, they are to de-
Cide whether or not they wish to
make the purchase of a Cyclone com~
pulsory.

This editorialwill point out some
of the reasons why such a measure
should not pass. The reasons listed
here are more fully discussed on the
editorial page and all figures given
there are open to investigation.

Major reasons why the Cyclone
must NOT be made compulsory are:

1. Those interested in secing the
measure puss have intimated that
tho Cyclone is likely to lose money
this year. Figures show that with
only the nruuuils wlilclr the business
manager admits are either sold or
promised, the management would
make money. The Cyclone nocd not
he Subsidized. Detailed figures may
be found in the editorial ncyclone
Profits Secure Now," on page 2.

2. if a Cyclone is made compul-
sory it is only fair to expect that any
number of other things such as play
tickets, football programs, etc, might
be placed on the some basis. This is
discussed in the editorial “Be Fair
With Yourself" on page 2.

3. Statements that last year‘s Cy-
clone xvent in debt are false in that
collection of outstanding bills would
remove the deficrt. This is also dis-
cussed in the editorial “Cyclone
Profits Secure Now."

4. Students asking that this meas—
ure he passed refused to allow it to
he dlscussed in open convocation. it
is obvious that. open discussion would
spell defeat.

5. Advertisers do not object to
yearbook advertising on the grounds
of limited circulation. Compulsory
circulation would not mean any lnlore
thorough reading of the annual.

6. Any reduction in prico means
that the money is being taken from
the pockets of those being forced to
buy the hook against their will to see
that others, desiring the yearbook
my get a reduced rate. This is un~
just.

7. The plan has been figured on
the basis of present contracts and
so would not produce a better qual-
ity of book as is claimed by backers
of the semester rec arrangement

3. The smtement that many other
schoou have such a plan is equally
good on the other side of the fence.
Ask backers of the plan if it was
EVER passed in all: institution which
allowed open discussion of the ques-
tion. Such a discussion at South Du-
kota university broke ,up in a riot.

9. Any product which is not worth
buying for its worth should not be
sold by force. The Cyclone can stand
on its own feet.

10. In seeking approval of adminv
lstrativc officials on this plan, ﬁg-
ures shown in today's paper, which
show the Cyclone financially sound,
were not revealed.

These points arc discussed in de-
tail in today's editorial columns of
The Scarlet and Black. it will pay
you to read them and to take them
with you to meetings tomorrow
night. They are not verbal statements
of a primed campaigner, but may be
challenged and will stand publicity
and investigation

Students— Given
Right to Books
3 Hours Daily

Pboposed- System Merely
ins Experimentation

Says Payne

Library stacks at Grinnell col-
lege will be opened to students
within the llext two weeks for
three hours each (lily, Charles E.
Payne, chairman of the libl‘al‘y
committee, announced today. This
will be all experiment to see if
students can use the stacks pl‘Op—
nrly. The decision was made at
the faculty meeting Monday rifts
erlloon, and the details of hours
and checking out. of books left to
the library committee.

Mr. Payne said ill all interview
today that when the stocks were
closed to students two and a half
years ago because of the excessive
loss of books the library commit-
tee hoped the students would
realize the loss to themselves and
propose a plan to safeglard books
so that the stacks could be re-op-
cried.

Students (lo—operate

In View of the fact that several
student organizations, including the
student council, the council of house
chairman, Lantern, and The Scarlet
and Black, have indicated their will-
ingness to assist in protecting the
hooks, and Since the students have
been careful in keeping the quiet
hours in the library this fall, the
committee felt encouraged to try the
open stacks again.

‘ While no definite plans have been
formed by the library committee, the
three hours each day that the stacks
are open will probably vary on dif-
ferent days, Mr. Payne said. Com-
plete details will not be ready for
several days, and the plan will go
into effect in about a week or 10
days.
Only One Door

In the plan under consideration
only one door into the stacks will be
open, and a librarian will he station.
ed at a desk beside the door to check
out all books. Books will be return—
ed at the usual place, however.

Possibility that students wiu have
more books than before from which
to select those which they read re—
sults from a $15,000 gift from the
Carnegie corporation, announced this
week.

American Culture
in Three Stratus
Biclzman Finds

American civilization is divided in-
to three cultural streams, the fusian
of which, if it were possible for such
a thing to take place, would solve
many of the economical and social
problems of life, according to Martin
H. Bickhsm, superintendent of the
special work division of the Illinois
free employment service, who spoke
at Vespers here Sunday.

The “tide water" cultural stream
is a result of the search for freedom
which inspired ancestors of Amer-
icans to leave England and search
for a new continent. Colleges like
Grinnell and Oberlin are the outcome
of a "Puritan" stream which is in—
terested chiefly in education, while
the great foreign population in
America is the cause of a “contins
cntal culture stream."

Each of these streams is a law line
to itself and an individual from one
stream cannot adjust himself easily
if forced to live in a foreign one.
Colleges should accept an attempt
at fusian as a goal toward which to
strive, Mr. Bickham believes.
