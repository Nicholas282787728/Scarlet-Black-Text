Exhibit Paintings
May ISiJune 30

Twenty-two water color paint-
ings by Miss Edith Sternfeld,
assistant professor of art, will be
displayed in a one-man exhibit
at the Joslyh Memorial art gallery
in Omaha, Neb., May 16 to June
so, it was learned yesterday.

The request for the exhibit
came as a result of the prizes
Miss Sternfeld won last year at
the annual five-state exhibit in
the gallery last December.

“Sunlight," a first place winner,
and “Boat B ilders," were the
paintings exhi ited at that time.

Indnrdunl Shoiving

Each year, instead of a prize,
the winner of this exhibit is given
the opportunity to display his or
her pictures at an individual
showing in the art gallery, Miss
Sternfeld explained,

The priblic relations department
is planning a preview of this exs
hihit at the quadrangle April 30
to May 9.

Single Showing

This will be the first time that
there has been any single showing
of Miss sternfeld's work though
many of her pictures have been
hung in different buildings of the
campus at various times.

The exhibit will include some
of her far-in pictures as well as
her latest ones, Miss Sterhfcld
stated.

The pictures were painted in
Color-ado, California, Stone Qty,

Wednesday

By F. \Villlcr Hullmiin

On Wednesday evening last,
the historic shingles of Herrick
chapcl again vibrated on the
times of the campus- select men
singers. D. E, Peck and his
“boys" were in fine voice, so fine,
in fact, that many (including the
Old Timers) declared the Glee
club had never been heard to
better advantage.

The program was so planned to
give an excursion through the
musical types of several cena
turies, From 16th century Morley
to modern Bruch (not omitting
that folkrsong', the ubiquitous
“John Peel" which is to the Glee
club as the “Sanctus” is to the
Choir) is no small chronological
straddle.

Will Acquainl‘
New Officers
Wi’rh Dulies

30 Are Expected;
Campus Problems
Will Be Studied

A Special conference of the'
retiring and incoming mem-
bels ot the Student Council,
campus governing body, will
be held in Grinnell sometime
during the first week in
May. Thomas Keehn, repre—
sentative of the Young
Men’s Christian association
on the governing body and
chairman of the Council com-
mittee on arrangements, said
today.

Plans for the conference were
arranged by Keehn and Alice
Ebeling, second on the committee.
with the aid of the Student Coun-
cil.

Purpose

The purpose of the conference,
Keehn pointed out, is to bring
the members of the old and new
Student Council together so that
the retiring officers may coach
the incoming members in their
particular duties on the Council.

An attempt will he made,
Keehn said, to acquaint the new
officers with their responsibilities
and to aid them in making plans
for the future and in carrying
on the unfinished business of the
outgoing group.

“Conference Needed"

“It has always been customary
for the retiring Council to leave
office with nothing accomplished
in the way of preparing the new
officers for their Jobs,” Keehn
asserted, "and it is our belief
that, to have a more efficient his
coming group, a conference of this
sort is needed "

The date and location of the
conference in Grinnell has not as
yet been decided upon, Keehn
stated, adding that orginally it
was planned to have the meeting
at Brooklyn where the campus
leader-s met last fall to formulate
a new campus policy.

Keellll explained that lack of
time and conflicts with other or-
ganization meetings made the
Brooklyn conference impossible
for this spring.

Evolficio Members

All members of both councils,
including ex-officio members, will
attend the conference. About 30
are expected at the meeting.

The conference will begin with
dinner, and the evening will be
devoted to acquainting the new
officers with their duties.

According to John Spence, re-
tiring president of the campus
governing body, the new Council
will he faced with the semester
fce allocation to carry on next
year's activities, such as athletics,
music, lectures, debate, the college
band, glee clubs, and similar or-
ganizations.

The 1938 Student Leaders con-
ference at Brooklyn next fall will
be another item of business for-
the new Council, Spence said.
