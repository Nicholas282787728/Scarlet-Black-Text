WHY NOT MINOR LETTERS?

As the curtain is drawn upon another Grin-
nell football season it is once more true that lack
of Candidates was one of the most serious handi-
caps which the Pioneer coaches and team were
required to overcome The matter has become
increasingly serious in the past four or five years,
and although this fall’s large freshman squad
promises partial relief next year, some definite
step should be taken to encourage the sophomore
prospects to report.

The present difﬁculty seems to be that there
is little or no attraction for a man to report unless
he has a good chance to become at least a first
string reserve. The size of the squad has been
so small that the possibility of arranging games
for a reserve team has been out of the question,
and the “failenders” on the squad have very little
to look forward to. How is it then that many
large schools which do not schedule B team
games get out 70 to 80 men, over half of whom
stand no chance of making the varsity? The
answer to this must be m the minor awards made
at all such mstitutions—so Why not give this
practice a trial at Grinnell?!

It would involve very little expense, if that
argument should be used against inauguration
of such awards. It would be unnecessary to give
sweaters to the minor letter winners. A small
chenille G could be presented with the option of
wearing it on regular Honor G sweaters if the
athlete wishes to purchase one himself.

Whether winners of the minor emblems
should become fullrﬂedged members of the Honor
G club or not would be up to the club’s members
to decide. If they feel that this would lessen
the value of the major G, the minor letter win-
ners might form auxiliary organization of some
Sort.

But suchl problems as those could be settled
with little difficulty if it was decided to intro—
duce the plan, and the second and third string
reserves would be given a real inducement to
remain on the squad Deﬁnite requirements
for the winning of a minor award, similar to the
ones for a varsity letter could be drawn up so
that it would be a very genuine privilege to wear
one of the smaller letters.

An added incentive must be provided if a
satisfactory squad is to report for football next
fall We believe that the minor award would
provide this incentive.

A BURLESQUE UPON JUSTICE

To Harold L. Stuart, one of Samuel Insull’s
fellow defendents in the recent notorious trial,
the verdict of not quilty returned by the jury
was a reaffirmation of “my faith in American
institutions.” On the other hand to many Amer—
ican citizens this verdict proved once more the
hopeless incompetence of trial by jury. In the
midst of a welter of tears and protestations of
honesty, dear old Samuel, the victim of erroneous
judgment and unfortunate circumstances was
deemed innocent.

Insull’s strongest defenses were his own tears
and sentimental prattle of other days. When

evidence of deceit was presented, he plead
ed that his actions were result of a m
take in judgment. The dazzling parade of d
tinguished character witnesses blinded the jury-
men as to the true nature of the case.

The government lost the trial in that it over—
estimated the intelligence of the jury while the
defense won its case by turning the trial into an
emotional debauch. The evidence presented by
the government was of necessity decidedly tech-
nical. The prosecution attempted to show by
an analysis of the lnsull books that statements
sent through the mails in selling stock were un»
justified. It produced two difficult algebraic
equations to prove that Corporation Securities
stock was not worth what Mr. Insull had said it
was. But according to competent witnesses of
the trial, all this material Went far above the
heads of the jurors. Even the judge had diffi—
eulty understanding it.

It would not be fair to blame the jurors for
not understanding the evidence for it was beyond
the scope of their knowledge and understanding.
But let us blame the judicial system that permits
such a case to be tried by men who are relatively
ignorant both in the fields of high finance and
the technicalities of law. The evidence present»
ed by the prosecution could have been handled
and understood satisfactorily only by men with
an expert knowledge of finance and law. To
the ordinary citizen it was nothing more than an
hodge-podge of unintelligible terms and symbols.

It is to be hoped that the Insull trial, the
most serious miscarraige of justice that has oc-
curred in this country since certain of the abor-
tive Teapot Dome trials, will bring home to the
American people the sad need for reform in the
administration of justice. The sad burlesque
upon science and justice which trial by jury
presents should be eliminated from the judical se-I
up, and for it should be substituted a sane, com»
patent and intelligent method of trial.

REGIMENTATION IN THE COLLEGES
The New Republic

Back in the twenties, it was the constant despair
of college deans and trustees that the rights of self—
government, self-discipline and free expression granted
to student bodies were wasted in meaningless wars
over which fraternity should rule the campus, in end—
less debates as to whether the dormitory drunk should
be publicly or privately censured and in editorials vilify-
ing the annual football rival. Today when students
are exercising these same rights to express vigorously
their opposition to war and fascism, to discuss frankly
the society of chaos and misery they have inherited, the
rights have often been summarily withdraw-II and the
offending students disciplined, For an editorial against
war the editor of The Santa Clara Weekly was expelled
and for the lese majeste of criticizing the Republican
candidate for Governor, the editor of the University
of Oregon paper was recently ousted. But the most
flagrant trampling of student rights has occurred at the
City College of New York and the University of Cali.

In the former college as a result of a student plo-

including the president of the student body and the
chairmen of the forensic board, the men’s board, and

tleman or an astute politician, declared an attempt to
be under way "to destroy the university by handing it
over to an organized group of Communist students."
The basis for his charge was student efforts to set up

C. C. N_ Y. and the U. C. L. A. situations has been the
appeal by responsible adminis ration officers to ”loyal”
students to purge their universities of the influence of
