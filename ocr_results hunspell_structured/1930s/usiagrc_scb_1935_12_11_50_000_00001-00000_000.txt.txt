The Oregon style of debating
consists of three man teams with
the first speaker on each team de-
livering a 12-minute constructive
speech. Then each team is allowed
a 10-minute period of cross-exam-
ination conducted by the second
speakers, and this is followed by
an eight-minute summarization
given by the remaining two speak-
ers, according to William Phillips,
student debate manager, who ex;
pleined the new method.

“It is hoped that this type of de-
bate will become increasingly pope
Illar," Phillips said yesterday.
Since this method of debating was
first originated, it has become ins
creasingly popular for three rear
sons. First, because such debates
are more interesting to the audi-
cnce; second, because members of
the teams have to he more then
‘oughly acquainted with their
cases; and thirdly, hccsue there is
little or no opportunity for a
“canned" debatceone that is come
plctely prepared beforehand,"
