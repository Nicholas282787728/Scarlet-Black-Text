Talking—Film 9
Will Replace
Regular Talk

Picture Will Depict Stages
of Man's Development;
Here Jan. 19

An eight recl talking picture cntitled
”The Human Adventure" will be
shown Jan 16 as the next teaturc on
the lecture program, it was revealed
today by Prot E. B T Spencer, bcad
ol the committee in charge of the lac.
tur-c course. Thc ﬁlm was prepc ed
under the supervision of Professor
J- ncs chiy Breasted, head of the
O ciital institute at the Univel’siy of
Chicago.

“The picture,” according to Profes—
sor Spencer, “will represent all the
stages of man’s development from
most primitive man down through the
various stages of Civilization.”

The film itself took three years to
prepare and deals with the archaeolog.
ical work of the Oriental Institute, Til;-
picture will show scenes [Tom the
lands where civilization first arose ..
Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Anatolia, Iraq
and other countries.

Professor Breasted, supervisor of the
ﬁlm, and head of the Oriental institute
of the University of Chicago, has
been associated with the sunivei-sity
since 1894. He has written ,ineny
books upon history and upon special
phases of Egyptology. “His name,“
Mr. Spencer declared, “guarantees the
pcrfect accuracy of everytlung pre—
sonted."

Because of the necessity for having
a moving picture machine, the place
where the film will be shown has not
been designated. This will be an.
iiounced immediately after Christmas
vacation, Professor Spencer said.

Semester fees will admit to this lcae
ture as they have to other numbci‘b
on the lecture program,

The film has received approbation
where over it has been shown, accords
ilig to Mr. Spencer, “Over 3,000 people
witnessed the picture at the University
of Michigan At the Philadelphia
Academy of Music the performance
was sold out [our weeks in advance
At Hartford, Conn, the film played
four days to large audiences in the
Bushnell Memorial hall.

“Nothing of greater value or inter.
est has ever been presented in Gri .
nell This film will evidently rank
with the Beebe lecture in popularity,"
Professor Spencer declared.
