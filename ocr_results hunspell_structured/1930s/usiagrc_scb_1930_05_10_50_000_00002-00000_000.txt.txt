TEACHING FOR, THE GRADUATE.

Whenever seniors at the quadrangle begin to dis-
cuss their plans for the future, the greater part of the
conversation deals With the securing of teachers’ posi-
ﬁrms The list of registrations for such positions at the
persunncl'office conﬁrms the impression gained from
listening to these discussions,

Fifty-six per cent of the women who gladuate in
June and thirty-two per cent of the entire class of 1930
are planning to begin their careers in the academic at-
mosphere in which they have spent all of their lives,
These plans are being made in spite of the over-crowd»
ad conditions existing in the teaching profession.

this non that there were be 11:45 fice May 12 to 13 Inclnswa
hours at the Quadrangle tonight. The
dancing at the Brown Derby Drag is
to stop at 11:30 p. m., however,

has remained stationary since the year 1900. In that
time, the number of college graduates has tripled. Since
women are in the majority in most college classes, and
since the majority of women in these colleges plan to
teach, the conclusion is obvious. The greater the
spread of higher education, the more teachers there will
he for whose work there is little or no demand. in the
case of Grinnell college, actual conditions bear out this
conclusion. A number of lost yenr’s graduates are still
seeking teaching positions.

The increase in the number of college graduates
has, of course. resulted in the over»cruwding of a. num-
ber of professions But the situation peculiar to the
teaching profession is that a. large number of those who
enter it have no real desire to make it their life work,
They have simply followed the line of least resistance
Ac respectable profession which requires no further
preparation, academic or practical, than they have at
graduation, After a few years, they recson, will come
marriage, or a more interesting job, or both. Teaching
ﬁlls in the time.

The results of this reasoning which are most evi-
dent in the teaching profession today are two: a great
number of teachers only mildly interested in their work,
and a lowering of salaries by the operation of the law
of supply and demand. The ﬁrst of these conditions is
an injustice to the children in the schools; the second
is an injustice to the men and women who really desire
to teach, as it makes the positions for which they are
ﬁtted much less proﬁtable to them than those in other
professions.

Thus the large group of college graduates, particu—
larly women, who teach simply to fill time, tend unv
consciously to lower the standards of the profession
which they are entering. Sylvia Joseph.

MONEY TO SPEND.

The Grinnell investments students recently pr ved
capable of handling their own finances hy gal ing
money on the investing of hypothetical funds. Yet,
their money in college is pretty largely spent for them.
They are required to eat in dormitory or quadrangle
dining rooms. They are expected to pay for semester
fees. They are placed in certain buildings and charged
house dues for the privilege.

There are students on the campus who now want
the dance fees included, also, if the various acti ity
fees are always added to the sum paid to the college at
the beginning of the year, perhaps the ”Grinnell type,"
of which Ruth Suckow wlcte so sdt‘ 'cally recently, will
become even more prevalent than it is now. One must
conform, or at least pay the price of conformity. If he
wants to go without breakfast, he must pay for it. if
he doesn't want to see football, basketball or track cone
tests, he pays for them anyway.

It seems that it would be only consistent, as long
as some activities enjoy the protection of collections by
the college treasurer, that others should, also. Why
not include subscriptions to the campus publications, a
certain fund for books and perhaps a general fund for
incidentals. 0n the other hand the dormitories and
quadrangle would probably continue to be fully oc»
cupied, even though residence there wasn't required in
the strict fashion that it is, a2! it does seem entirely
possible that a student who so desires should be allowed
to conserve a. bit on the money spent for meals and
house dues. If he is willing to drop from campus life
altogether in order to secure an education, it should be
his privilege. Then, what would happen to the “Grill-
nell type." Kenneth E, Clayton.
