AN ASSET INSTEAD

The suggestion of a second mixed choral group comes
in all seriousness from men and women on this campus
who are intelested in singing, but who arenot qualified
for glee club membership. It is no one‘s idea to make
the group a club for “gripers”—for those who are dis»
gluntled because they have not been able to pass tryouts.

Several glee club members have expressed the doubt
that there is room for such an organization on this cam—
pus, and have said they thought it might replace the
established vocal clubs or at least detract from their im-
poltance in campus life.

As we understand it, the project has been advanced
with no such idea in mind. We believe there is no re-
sentment toward the existing clubs on the part of those
who failed to “make” the glee clubs. These people mere—
ly love to sing and would like the experience in group
singing under the leadership of a qualified director.

As for detracting from the interest in the regular glee
clubs, quite the contrary would be true. The person who
has sung in supervised choirs can better understand
music rather than just liking a “piece because I think it’s
pretty.” An audience, many of whose members do know
music, is surely more complimentary to a glee club and
appreciative of its concert —J. P.

CONGRATULATIONS

The editorial board acknowledges with pleasure and
with considerable satisfaction the prompt administrative
action of the Council of House Presidents and of the
League board in putting into effect the paper’s recent
suggestion that women be permitted to smoke in the
club-rooms at open house.

Although no arrangement has yet been made for a
smoking room for men at the Quad, the spirit of co—op-
eration manifest thus far assures us that the League
board undoubtedly is working on this problem

The paper sincerely hopes that, through the mutual
efforts of the chief executive bodies and of the Scarlet
and Black, other problems of campus life may be thor-
oughly discussed and adjusted to the best interests of
the majority of Grinnell men and Women. S

—F.R. .

COURTESY MIGHT HELP

The Scarlet and Black printed an editorial last Week
on the attitude of some Grinnell instructors and house
mothers toward the students. We feel that we were
justified in presenting such an editorial. However, there
are other persons on the campus who are connected in all
official way with the college who also deserve some
criticism.

We are referring to some of our college administra-
tive officials—not all, but some of them. It is unfortune
ately true that some of the college officials are positively
rude in their dealings with the students. One especially
unfortunate case was that of a college official who, when
told by a student that his family was hard pressed in a
financial way, replied that if they was it was because
the boy’s father didn’t know how to run his business.
Such rudeness is absolutely uncalled for, and it only leads
tolill-feelirlg between the students and the college offic—
la 5.

If such treatment were not quite common, it might be
excusable. But when it happens over and over again, it
is surely time for the students to demand to be treated
like human beings with some courtesygeven a minimum
amount. ——J.N.

THE GRINN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DORIC

THE RESULTS: The enormous ‘
interest manifested by the students
of Grinnell in Doric's presidential
poll is merely another indication
of the active and intelligent stu-
dent interest shown in other cam-
pus activities, athletics, studies,
publications, studies, student sclfr
government, and studies, to men—

tion a few.

see

The 13 votes cast in the poll is
by ﬂu- the greatest voluntary
contribution of scudcnrs in re-
cent years. Ten of this great
number were oust for All Laii»
don, “the Kansas Coolidge,” and
three checked the mimc of Frank
Roosevelt, the incompetent,
(sometimes spelled incumbent).
a s e

The same bum joke on all thc
Roosevelt ballots leads this dense
person to suspect that they were
all cast by the same voter, This
box»stuffer-upper claimed that he
(or she) would have voted for
Thomas (to which name was ap~
pended the phrase “Ted the rat”)
if it would get him off the cam-
pus. This further indicates the
fact that Roosevelt’s supporters
are interested in progressive social

legislation.
c c a

The average age of the voters
was 23, and by the ovemhelm-
ing plurality of 3-0 the student
body was opposed to the new
chapel lioiu'. Thus ends the first
colossal Doric student poll and
wc are indeed pleased to take
our thumb off the throbbing
pulse of public opinion.

THE WHEEZE OF THE WEEK
—We are reliably informed that
the officials of a. certain small
Iowa college have ruled it illegal
to have rocking chairs in the girls’
dormitories because it arouses the
maternity instinct, and have fur—
ther ruled that the young women
may no longer sit on the young
men's laps without first putting
down a magazine. These sugges—
tions may prove helpful in in—
creasing chapel attendance.

We were particularly pleased to
note the efficient manner in which
our self-government handled the
momentous problem of women
smoking at open house. This tre-
mendous issue has been hanging
fire for years, and It is only such
a progressive administration as
now serves us that could force ac-
tion.

We see in the last issuc of the

s. a B. that Grinnell had some

sort of official time back in the

1890’s. The clocks were last

set in 1902, according to the

story. Ah, for the good old days
when ii men know what time it

Next week we’ll have a guest
column by the Wheeler and Wool—
sey on the campus, Porter and
Dams. An cxcmpie of the Davis
Wit: a cal-load of colored men
whipped through Grinnell this
summer on U, s. 6, Davis eyed
the car and casually suggested
that the American Olympic team
must be home.
