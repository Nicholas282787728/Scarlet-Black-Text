Loyalist and rebel troops in
Spain finished nine months of
warfare last week. but there was
no sign that hostilities would soon
cease. The rebel forces have been
bombarding Madrid regularly
without much effect. More suc—
cessful has been their drive to
capture Bilboa. At the end of this
week the Basques seemed on the
verge of defeat. though on other
fronts the loyalists seemed to be
holding their ground.

Around Spain troops of the new
tral powers are standing guard as
pickets. The main reason for this
cordon of armed forces is that the
powers have decided that the war
will cease only when the combat
ants run out of war supplies. Fur»
ther action by the other nations of
Europe is expected any day.

s t a

Publishing of the memoirs of ex»
king Alfonso of Spain’s aunt Eur
lalie last week created a minor
scandal among the high-ups in
Europe. Among other things it
revealed that the Spanish royal
family had contributed nearly
310.000.000 to the support of Gen-
eral Franco’s forces. Franco be-
lieved that he could win the war
in two weeks. At present he has
given up hope of winning very
soon and is looking for money to
continue.

v r s

Herr Hitler has gone on record
as being willing to join a confer
ence on peace if the leader of one
of the great nations will call it
His suggestion is that President
Roosevelt organize the meeting.

Two Seek Needed Funds as Others
Ponder Ownership of $10 Fine

Reed, Coggeshall Search
for Money as Evans,

Buckley Wonder
/

John Buckley. president of the
Council of House presidents. tar
day was pondering over a weigh-
ty problem. so was Dayle Ev-
ans. president of Gates hall.

 

 

 

 

BUCKLEY EVANS

The difficulty is the result of
an attempt by Charles Reed and
Robert Coggeshall, Rawson ball
residents to smoke Gates men
out of their hall “like 'possums.”
by replacing a burning paper cons
tainer that had been taken from
the hall.

All of this happened at 12:45
a. m.. Tuesday morning. The
culprits were taken in tow by
Willard White. Gates hall man,
and the following day the two
confessed and were fined $5 each
by the Council of House Presi-

 

dents in a special meeting.

I!

The problem that is facing
Buckley is the disposal of the
$10 that will be paid in fines.
Does it belong to the Council of
'House Presidents? Evans does
not think so. Neither do the
Gates hall members. They seem
to think it is rightfully theirs.

Since the council of House
Presidents. as a body. has never
before imposed a fine. according
to Buckley. there is no precedent
to be followed. Meanwhile. he
ponders.

But Buckley and Evans are not

L the only ones pondering over the
, question.

Reed and Coggeshall are won-
dering where they are going to
find the so to pay the fine.
They seem to think that it would
be best if Buckley and Evans dis—
missed the idea of who the money
belongs to until they can {Ind
the $5 each.

will not carry grade points. and
the sixth grade will be falling.

The plan will go into effect in
September. according to Miss Mc-

More Logical System

“We are trying to provide a
more logical. and a more unified
system of grading.” Dr. Henry s.
Conard, chairman of the faculty,
said in explaining the new system.

“Now no one knows what an av-
erage grade'is. Some instructors
use ‘B‘ and some use ‘C,’ thus
making adequate comparisons im-
possible. In this new plan. we
think we will have a more mathe-
matically correct way of grading,"
