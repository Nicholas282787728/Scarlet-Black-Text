about 80 men out for varsity
basketball in that time, he said.
Someone then asked, “How could
they get so men on the men‘s
gymnasium floor at one Lime?“
Grunts lirtci-iien-s,

Hopkins smiling broadly, ex-
plained this by saying that they
did it in shifts.

Asked if he had played any
basketball since his Grinncll tlays,
the secretary said that he had
only been on the fleet once since
he played on the Grinnell team.

"And then I didn’t recuperate
for months, he laughed

Tentative plans had been made
for a luncheon with several
Poweshiek county farmers tomor-

against this in preference to vis-
iting some of the farmers, me
eluding A. J. Blakely, jl'., who
was in college at the same time
as Hopkins.

Pioneers’ Second
Indoor Meet Friday
Will Test 24 Men

Coach G. Lester Duke will take
a squad of 24 varsity trackmcn
to Des Moincs, Friday, for the
Drake dual moot. For 15 of the
inch, it will be their first taste
of competition for the track seas
son.

Last week at the Illinols Re-
lays, the Pioneer thin clads cope
pod a fourth place in the two
mile college i-elay with Ray Cross-
nian, Ncuman Foll, William Ped-
ersen and Harold Sceger ruin
hing.

The only man to place in the
individual events was Burke Powe
ers who placed second with a
leap of 23 ft. is and a fraction
inches. This was a remarkable
feat in that it was Powers first
competitive Jumplng of the year
and he was up against the best
compet' ion the middle west has
to offer.

Drake has a well balanced
squad of trackmen that will be
heavy favorites to repeat their
dual meet triumphs over Grinnell
as they did last year. The Fio—
neei-s bcst chances appear to be
in the broad Jump, pole vault, 850
yard run and the ihile.
