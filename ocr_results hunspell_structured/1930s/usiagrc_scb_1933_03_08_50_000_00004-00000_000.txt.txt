if there is only one force acting
the outcome may be precisely pre-
dicted. but whether or not China will
become further militarized is a ques-
tion more complicated in nature.
From what I can see there are at
present at least three forces in act-
ion.

The reaction against continued
foreign aggression of course spurs
the nation on toward Western mill—
tarization. These fifty years we have
seen foreign exploitation come in
various forms. There are those forms
which are hidden from the public
eye and are seen and felt only by the
educated few; there are others that
work in broad daylight. often arous-
ing a feverish public sentiment among
us. A: an example of provocative
nets of foreign aggression which
come naked and in the most r’idlc»l
ulous ways. there is the frequent
staging of bayonet drills, sham.‘
battles and other military mane-cum.
res by the Japanese soldiers on the
thoroughfares of some of the largest
cities. such as Peiping. Tientsin and.
Shanghai.

Mititary Foes Rehearse

We are bound by treaties to allow
our foes to rehearse on our own soil
so that they can perfect their steps.
and be assured that when the time
comes for the actual performance it
will be a success. How would the
Englishman feel if the army of his
enemy nation should stage a sham
battle right in Piccadtlily circus or
make a charge around the Hyde
Park Corner” What would the New
York pedestrians think if they should
see soldiers of some other nation
brandishing their bayonets on Fifth!
avenue? It is toward intolerable acts'
of this kind that thc average Chinese
people have borne their anti.foreign
feelings and their national conscious.
ness.

Pulling at the other end of the
rops are the warlords all over the‘
country. Their fear that the military:
power of the nation will fall into the
hands of the people as a whole and
their efforts to prevent this make.
further extensive militarization by}
the central government extremely‘
difficult. Under these m' ‘tary heads
China has already two million mer-
cenarles. The revenues of the entirel
nation can hardly upkeep an army'
of such a prodigious size. In such a
situation the disbanding of soldiers
seems to he a much better subjecL
to discuss than the militarization of
the nation.

Lack Leadership

The indifference of the mass of the
people and the lack of leader-ship for
their guidance form another power—
ful force pulling against militarism.
Foreign aggressions arouse only the
townsfolks and those who are directs
ly affected; to those teeming mill-
ions that compose the rural mass.
national disasters of the greatest
magnitude decrease in importance in
proportion to the extent of their Im-
derstsnding and concern. in fact
many happenings which we consider
paramount disasters are really mate
ters that least concern them. for al
Chinese peasant is thoroughly con-
tented if he can only reap what he
has sown. Moreover. the local and
central governments do very little to
represent the interest of the agricuL
turalists.

its no people can care for their
nation before they feel that the gov.‘
ernment is theirs. how can one ex»
pect the common people of our coun—
try to respond to the high—sounding
calls of the few nationalistic propa-
gandi‘sts? However. the very narrow
view of the common people suggests
the possibility of directing it into use
ful and cooperative channels. .

Democracy May Mean lililitai-ism

Coming back to our subject. if the
Chinese people are not, in the near
future. fortunate enough to enjoy a
strong and stabilized government.
representing and supported by the
whole nation. there is little prospect
for this country to he so universally
militarized as France and pre-war
Germany. On the other band. should
democracy be more thoroughly real-
ized in China. the lessons which she
has learned in her precarious situa—
tion of the past half a century. and
the high tension of the present world
will beyond doubt put a rifle into the
hands of every able-bodied Chinese.

When Japan first unsheathed her
sword to occupy Mukdcn on the night
of September 18, 1931. public senti-
ment in China was roused to white
heat. Four months later it was raised
to a higher pitch when Japan extend-
cd her military operations all over
the Three Eastern provinces and.
made the ruthless assault on Shang.‘
hai. inflicting enormous damage to

x one

 

the “Paris of the Orient".

Since then. most Chinese have
come to see that at such a critical
moment. when our nation with all her
culture is threatened with tiic dalle
yer of being washed forever as a
nation. from the surface of the earth,
it is no longer possible for us to cool
tinuc in our same old quiet and or-
derly life.

Students have taken the lead by
militarizing themselves. making mil

sory course in many high schools and
colleges. Women and girls have taken

anxious to do their bit behind the
battle front.

In certain areas. laborers and peas»
ants have organized themselves into
volunteer corps. All these. in addition
to increasing Government forces. are
signs of a further militarization of
the Chinese people Thus. in spite or‘
the forces against it. the process of
militarizing the whole countiy is be.
gun. For what else can we do at this
moment to check our neighbor's re»
pcated advances?

But even if we are driven to this
last resort. 1 have one faith in my
motherland. That is that the powers
which force China to become mili-
tary-minded will never make her a

ad»dog that threatens international

eace. The peaceful nature of the

renter portion of our countrymen
and the Three People's principles that
prevail and take root so deeply in the
minds of every intellectual will guide
China along a more sensible path.

Editor. The Scarlet and Black
Dear Sir:

We were amused to notice an edi-
torial entitled “NOrDecision Debates"
in the March 4 issue of The Scarlet
and Black. if the writer of this edi-
torial had had more than a passing
interest in forensic activities on the
Grinnell campus. he would have real—
ized that the purpose of Grinnell de-
bating is not to win a decision, but
rather to prepare the participants
for the business or profession: which
they may pursue. in the debate pics
gram for 1933. Prof. J. P. Ryan
states the purpose of dcbate as fol-

lows:

“The aim of intercollegiate debat-
ing is not that of winning decisions.
although such a feature has its place.
it is rather for the purpose of galli-
ing training and experience in the
organization and presentation of evi.
dence. its value lies in the develop
ment of logical analysis. clear think-
ing. cogent reasoning. pleasing dc-
livery. and convincing appeal; as yet.
no substitute has been found in which
these qualities are combined to such
a striking degree."

in one of the closing paragraphs
of the editorial it is stated that . .
everyone followed closely the argu-
ments set forth by the speakers of
both teams . . can it be that a
Grinnell college audience is not slit»
ficiently intelligent to mach a de-
cision on a question of fact. especial-
ly after having listened so intently
to the arguments presented? We are
convinced that such an audience is
competent to arrive at its own con»
clusion. and needs no “guiding in.
teliect" to mould its opinion.

Without a doubt this editorial does
not express the collective view of the
student body (or even of The Scarlet
and Black). but is rather the senti-
ment of a few souls who advocate

 

victory for victory's sake. Such an
editorial can have but little effect on
the intelligent advance of debating
in Grinnell college.
Respectfully.

The Scar-let and Black
Dear Sir:

It seems to me that college spirit
and interest is on the decline. If the
whole college could make suggeSr
tions for amusement. interest could
he heightened.

This might be accomplished. by all-
lowing students to submit suggestions
to The Scarlet and Black. and have
them published to inform students
of the suggestions.

Each student might pay the small
sum of a quarter and with this money
a radio could be bought for the
Recreation room. Then. the Recrea-
tion room could be used for dancing
each night from 9:30 to 10 o'clock.

Also, house chairmen could hand in
a list of studcnts talented in various
lines, and weekly entertainment per-
formances could be given on Friday
night to he followed by dancing. This
would furnish amusement for those
who do not dance.

 

I’m sure that numerous suggestions
could be made. and i think that all
would agree that during this depres-
sion the campus is rather dead.

Yours truly.
