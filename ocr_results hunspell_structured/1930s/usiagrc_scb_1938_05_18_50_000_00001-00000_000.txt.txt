Old Maids, Prejudiced Curia Help
Complicate “Trial by Jury” Plot

a

Love Entanglement
Features Huffman,
Hospers in Leads

“Do not expect anything but
the singing to be serious when
you attend Trial by Jury' Thurs
day and Friday nights,” Mrs.
Sara Sherman Pryor, director of
the production, said today.

It is a Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta and is up to par with
all their others for humor, she
added.

The setting of the production
takes place in an English court
room in 1875 and casts F. Waltcr
Huffman in the role of a villainous
rogue who is shed for breach of
promise by the leading lady of

 

the play, played by Marian Hos—
pers.

Complications in the plot are
caused by the fact that all the
spectators are old maids who get
their only enjoyment in life from
scandal and that the jury is made
up of 12 men who hate Huffman
and love Miss Hospci-s.

According to Mrs. Pryor, con»
siderable comedy is supplied by
the scene in which Miss Hospcrs
and Huffman take turns dragging
each other across the stage.

The story ends with John Youl'd,
Edward Kruse, Donald Ward and
all the jury making love to the
Jilted bride while the villainous
lover makes love to Dorothy Ko-

zeika, the head bridesmaid.

Macy Madhouse
Agoin; Boys Set
Clocks Ahead

Those Macy boys, up to more

Then they awakened everyone else

breakfast.

At approximately 5 a. m.. Grin-
nell standard time, the Macy boys
were devouring their breakfasts
while the rest of the campus was
peacefully wrapped in the arms
of old man Morpheus,

Came 6:59 a. m. and most of
the boys were scurrying down the
streets cursing for over sleeping
and trying to think of excuses
for being late to their 8 o'clock
classes.

Imagine the chagrin and un-
happiness of these fellows when
they found their class rooms
em ty and realized they had sa-

ced one full hour of sleep
