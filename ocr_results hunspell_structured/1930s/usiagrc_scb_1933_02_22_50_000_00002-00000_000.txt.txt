WHO WON?

It so happens tllat an often defeated but sine
ccrc basketball team has frequently bccll subjcctcd
to lllucll llarsll criticism. It has also been colllulelld-
cd for fine work when the occasion arrived.

Tllis was possible only because there was a

re outcome to each contest and the student
body was aux ous to follow this team’s maneuvers
to the filial whistle. The chalice of a victorious out-
come drcw tlle owtl to the game and possibility
that the temp might convert defeat into victory be
fore the filial whistle h‘eld thcln there.

This situation does not 0. st in debates. Most
Verbal combats sponsored by the school are nor
do sion contests and give the average student no
means of knowing tllc real caliber of tllc Grinncll
tcanl.

Students are often criticized for lack of in
tel-est in debating~yet they can hardly be blamed
under the present lloedccisiou system.

It is interesting to note, that in the lbw ill):
biltcs ill which decisions have been gircll. Grinllell
argucrs have not been tleéfcatcd.

CYNICISM

In his vcspers address hcrc Sunday, Rabbi
Stephen S. Wise of New York attacked the ’lllk 1
attitude of many present day student . “ ,Vlll\ sin
is the unchallcugiltg acceptance of all tllat is bad
in the world,” he said. The younger generation be
lieves that it is “smart” not to care, he declared

There is much truth in the New York leftdc
statement. Cynir sill . looked upon as a tics 'cd
quality on the college campus, and even the, pol

so who does care deeply about social alld economic é

crises guns to pretend tllat llc llt no interest.
It is said that pill ularly in Amcl ea does the
younger gcncratiou seek to mask its emotions ;\
“pokcrefaoc” is a worthwhile accomplishment not
only ill the game itself, but ill tltc game of life.

Yet, much of the cynicism of the modern stile
dent is only Sltlllrdé'ep. He really cares, hilt he
wants no one to know it.

AMT-BODING

Tllc new. paper columns are filled these days
with news of Coach I’llog Allen’s antivbooing cam-
paign at the University of Kansas. The Jayllawk
mentor has led a (lctcrlllillcd fight to promote a
better spirit of sportsmanship, and according to
reports, has accomplished his purpose.

But in a recent issue of the Des Moincs lieg—
ister. we find a criticism of Allen for attacking un-
sportsmanlikc conduct on the part of the spectators
in one breath, and then bitterly criticising the work
of two Big Six officials ill tlle next.

This is amusing. If things are done as the
Register would have them done, why. then, did not
the people of the United States give the Republican
administration a vote of confidence and let them
continue in off c? The analogy isn't hard to see.

Allen’s criticism is contructivc, Busing our
judgments on the quality of the wol done by
several mitlwcstcrlr referees on the Grinllcll floor,
we are inclined to agree with hinl..(3‘rood basketball
cannot be played when games are allowed to get
out of control.

Visiting coaches, both conservative ad radical,
have almost unanimously found fault with the
quality of the officiating here. ~So tackling the
problem of good sportsmanship from the other end,
why not make good feeling easier to accomplish by
being more careful ill thé choice of officials?

JIG SAW PUZZLE PROSPERITY

Dr. Julius Klein, noted commercial expert, rc-
ccntly made the startling statement that the pres
ellt Ji Saw puzzle craze will bring us ollt of tho
dept-cs one

At fi st glance, such a statement sccllls ridi ,
tllous. Yet, it little thought reveals that there is
some truth ill Dr, Klein’s words at that Probably.
a puzzle fad won’t be enough to restore pt-ospelity
by itself—and yet, it may be a big help.

The Jig-Saw puzzle business amounted to
$10,000,000 last year and bids fair to show it sub-
stantial incl-case this year Fo- example, one cone

‘T'IMELY COMPLAINT

It may be nice to get up in the morning bllt
it ‘ nicer to stay ill bed until ' st about 10 luiutcs

7thle is, if one, can count on getting to this l ass
on time.

However, the apparently aggravating cause of
many ll g min, llloull. and out too is the lack of
time sycron . tioll of the many clocks on tho
campus.

A v once of from three to 10 minutes be-
tween \ arious clocks ally llour ill the day has been
reported to us as cause for mini, loud complaints
and not a few outs. That appeals to make this a
very timely complaint illtGleetl.

NEED FOR USHERS

At vespcr services, especially when there is a
particularly good speaker, crowds jam the back of
tho chapel and vestibule while there are plenty of
“want seats towards the from.

This condition gives r 'c to ll general feeling-
ni’ uneasiness that takes a few minutes to quict
down even after everyone has found a seat.

lVliy not make each hall rc'sponsiblc for four

handle the situation rasily and assure quick, offic-

The danger of p: 'm is that it attaches
more significance to the menus than to tho lultuvr

Other Opinions

A MAN AND WOMAN STRUGGLE
(The College Eye)

_' Coeds are inconsistent; they "fawn and gush;"
they are husband-hunters. Thu's can be summed up the
charges of a male student at Temple university in writ-
ing of the women students at that institution. And there
is no reason to think that Temple is not a typical Amer-
ican college.

Edward w. Groshell in the “Temple 0le tells what
he would wish to he like if he were of the opposite sex.

First. he would look up the word consistency and follow
its dictates; he would want to be individual: he would

dress warm in Winter, and take fleece lined slippers to
football games rather than suffer With the cold to show

his trim [or not so trim) ankles.

“Fairness of face and form is indeed a valuable
asset," he says, “and if I possessed this uncommon
feminine charm, I would capitalize on it, but my scholas
tic attainment would be a result of knowledge, even
in those courses where grades are computed on curves.”

And then the men get rubbed. Ellen Eaves, president
of the Temple VVomen’s League, pictures berslf as a
man, i

”I would be a. college man." she in'slnuates, ".th a
collegian or a campus big shot . . . . I would not be a
key hound . . . . I would quote professional clownsi
which means that I would taboo ‘so-O-OrmoJ “yow-sah.‘
and like expressions."

Miss Eaves would never give people a chance to
ask her why she did not shave, and under no circum-
stances, she emphasizes, would she wear a sweater with
no shirt beneathi‘yvhich automatically puts turtle.
necks out." ,

There is the picture of the college individual, look-
ing from the outside in. For a one sentence summary,
it seems that women should not he so dumb, and men
should wear shirts with their sweaters. on. well, that's
n easy thing for men to remedy.

INDEPENDENT THOUGHT
(Minnesota Daily)

A Chicago dean, J. R. Jewell, has been giving fresh-
men some advice on how to get good marks. He warns
against too much independence of thought, and adds
that “A" students are usually the ones who are careful
not to disagree with instructors

This bit of counsel sounds like the kind a worldly
sophomore might give a ﬁrst year man. But since a clean
of an important university has seriously offered it, the
statement is worth some comment.

Generally speaking, it takes more intelligence and
more knowledge of a subject to disagree with the in-
structor than to nod in agreement. Excepting the an-
noying students who always disagree with teachers on
principle, it is almost certain that. a, Student: arguing
with his professor is above the general level of his class.
To disagree with the text or the teacher, a. student must
he thoroughly familiar with their point of view as well
as with some other. Such a student deserves a better
mark than one who is willing to accept his professor as
final authority. '

Forced acceptance of a certain point of view is for-
eign to the spirit of a university. A modern university,
like Chicago or Minnesota, has an army of scholars at
work, drawing conclusions only after they have weighed
all evidences on both sides. Should these scholars, Who
are the faculty of a. university, teach their classes only
one side of a controversial questlon and lower the mark
of a student who introduces evidence on the other side?

Most faculty members, at least those of our acquaiu.
lance, would be the first to answer "No." But there are
all too few of them who can really remain unprejudiced
against a student who has the knowledge, the int/2111»
gence, and finally the courage to disagree violently with
them. Too many professors are quick to dismiss such a
student as one of the objectionable type we have already
mentioned, and overlook his sincerity, his interest in the
Subject and his desim to learn. A great many faculty
men and women, who would publicly brand Dean Jew-
clrs words as very poor advice, would do well to com
sider carefully whethtz!‘ independent thought actually
counts for or against a student in their classes.

Iowa college before it was named
Grinnell which brought the cyclone
of 1832 which came right before exe
ams which was a good thing.

The cyclone, like most cyclones,
left things in a mess and then the
music ball as built. It hasn‘t been
cleaned up yet. some of the debris fell
in one spot: and is called the men’s
gymnasium. Some is still falling and
is called throwing the bull.

Later Mr. Nollcn was president
which was a good thing because a
college must have a president. In
1933* the water pipes cracked which
was a. good thing because Doric
prints all good cracks.

That is all the history of Grinnelli‘
because history repeats itself.
