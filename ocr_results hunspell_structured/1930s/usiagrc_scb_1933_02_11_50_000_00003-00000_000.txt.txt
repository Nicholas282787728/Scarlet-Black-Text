‘Faith Must Supplant Self-Security,’
Pauck’s Message In Gates Lectures

Theologian Declares Crisis
Calls for Revision

of “Kingdom"

“Only by sacrificing self-security
and working for faith in Jesus Christ
and God can we defeat the present
crisis in our civ zalion,” said Dr.
Wilhelm Pauck, professor of church
history at Chicago Theological sem-
inary, in the fifth and final lecture
of the Gates series in Herrick chapel,
Thursday morning.

These lectures were given in con-
nection with the nineteenth annual
Fellowship conference of ministers,
an affair sponsored by crinnell col-
lege.

1n the first two lectures of the ser-
ies, delivered Tuesday. morning and
night, Dr. Fauck traced the social
and religious development of this
civilization lending up to the present
crisis.

Materialism Plel'ailed

“Up to the recent world economic,

crash. irit f materialism, self-l
’1 SP 0 ‘was concluded at noon Thursday, afr

security, and self-sufficiency prevail—
ed" declared the speaker “When
these people found their sclf.ruled
societies crumbling,
ly became pessimistic and could see
no hope in the future,” he added.

Dr. Pauck devoted the third andl

\Vm'mly Received

Pauck emphatically declared, "The
kingdom of God was established
amidst a world catastrophe and it
must he reestablished during our
present crisis."

Thursday at 9:40 am. Dr, Pauck
was warmly received by an enthuse
iastic audience before he began theI
final address. He gave a brief resume
of what had been said previously. He
then continued, discussing problems
leading up to the choice of the best
method of working out of the crisis,

“There is a curious contradiction in
the lives of all of us,” declared the
lecturer, “That which is and that
which ought to be. To rise above this
contradiction, we must apply our-
selves to that which is and always
search for that which is good.”

Ministers Confer

Pauck believes that the traditional
Christian is always ahead of that
which is and in his devotion to God
in a way, has overcome this world.

"The church," stated the speaker.
“is more than a sociological group.
it is a world fellowship of believers
in Christ and consequently, God."

He cited the argument that “The

Luther set forth in saving religion
from a crisis in the age in which he
lived. “This same argument is in-
effective today," he said.

Chri'st' Historic Event

“A recent and Successful religious

school is that created by Karl Barth,

a young German preacher and auth- . l
or," stated the speaker, “But~” he,

added, "That school is all right for
Europe while not for America,"

In his address Wednesday night Dr.
Pauck emphasized the point that
Jesus Christ was an historic event.
He said, “The modern world may re—
ject Christianity but it refers with
devotion to Jesus Christ. Therefore,
Jesus must be made the foundation
which will lead to an understanding
of God

Quoting the words of Jesus Christ,

“Repeat ye for the kingdom is at‘

fourth lecture that these words were

HEN you

ask a Chesterﬁeld

smoker why that’s his brand w, be
generally comes right out ﬂat-{cored and.
says . . .“ It’s because They ’re Milder!”

So we’re going

to keep on doing

everything we know how to keep them

that Way.

That 5 why we look for and buy the
mildest and ripest tobaccos we can get.
That 5 why we age them in our wareu
houses till they’ re mellow and sweet.

We believe that

even the shredding

of the tobacco . . . and the duality of the
paper it’s rolled in, have a lot to do
with the even-drawing, mild smoke that
people enjoy in Chesterﬁelds.

You can bank on this. . .every method
known to science is used to make Chest-
erﬁeld a milder, better-tasting cigarette

that satisﬁes.
