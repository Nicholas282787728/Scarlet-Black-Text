Lewis Library Gets
Two New Books

 

Two new hooks, one a rear»
ranged edition of the Bible and
the other “Green Margins" by E.
T, O'Donnell, are to he placed on
the shelves at the Lewis library
in the quadrangle soon.

The volume of the Bible is come
posed of selected material in a
purely literary form, not for the
use of theological students, and
is desigied for more extensive
reading by the layman.

Inventions designed for the dis-
comfort of the freshmen have
slumped badly in recent years, ac-
cording to reports from the
United States patent office. Back
in the '50s someone was patenting
a new torture device every month.
