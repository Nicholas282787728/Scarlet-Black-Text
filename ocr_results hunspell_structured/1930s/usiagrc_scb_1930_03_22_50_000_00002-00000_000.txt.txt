SUSPICION STILL itElGNs,

”American delegation at Naval conference yawns;
Stimson goes sightseeing at Windsor castle for day."
So reads a. press dispatch of the activities of America
at the bed of that fast—weakening patient, the London
conference. And it is a dispatch that would be laugh»
able were it not an additional reminder of what the
London conference has come to.

That large body of enlightened people in the world
who proclaimed a new spirit of internationalism in 1918
and saw it torn to shreds at Versailles, who hailed Lhe
League of Nations as the savior of humanity and saw
it struggle to live during its ﬁrst decade, who saw the
Geneva Naval conference of 1527 fail when the old nae
tionalistic spirit of 1914 again repeated itself, hoped last
fall when Hoover and MacDonald got together on the
Rapidan and presaged real naval limitation that the
,cause of peace was at length getting Lhe upper hand.
They saw in the London conference a meeting of the
Great Powers to which, for the ﬁrst time, the various
powers would admit that spirit of mutual confidence
which the League of Nations, to which they all belong,
save the United states, stands for.

Agaiuiwheh it had seemed that this time “again"
would not have to be employedithey are being forced
to admit that the spirit uppermost at London has been
that of suspicion: fear that one power will gain even
some small advantage at the expense of another.
In the hearts of men, the suspicion which breeds war,
the suspicion of the years previous to 1914, still reigns,
and the inevitable result to date at London has been a
series of endless debates between the powers in general,
or between groups of two or three powers, debates an-
imated not by a desire to obtain limitation of naval
armaments but to obtain as much as possible while giv-
ing up as little as possible. Meanwhile, the delegations
not interested at the particular moment have gone

sightseeing at Windsor castle, like Secretary Stimson,
thus showing lLlIC stalemate to which the conference has
come.

IL is not that Stimson’s action as quoted above is
Worthy of serious criticism, but that it merely illu—
strotes the fact that the conference has degenerated into
a. debating society, with the spirit of nationalism domin-
ant with tlrose powers, who are “sighseeing at Windsor
castle" mcr-cly awaiting their own turn to join in an exe
clusive debate with some other power, perhaps in turn
forcing- the other delegations to go “sightseeing."

Do the examples of this recalcitrant spirit at Lone
don need to be lllusttated? Those who have read the
papers from day to day have realized it only too truly.
For example—while Stimson was sightseeing the other
day, the conference was being held up by the French
and Italian delegations, who were vainly endeavoring to
agree on parity. Italy claims parity with France—just
Why is doubtful; France Will not yield Italy’s claim, as
she has a vague fear of Mussoli that can only mean
to a Frenchman larger armies and navies “of defense".
Meanwhile England and America. cannot come to any
agreement, partly because England insists that her lime
itation will be contingent on that, of France, partly be
cause America is insisting that she have absolute num-
erical parity with Great Britain. And neither England
or America will grant Japan her desire of a navy of
70% Amen'cztn British strength. Any or all the powers
may Lhus be taken to task: the Nation, for example
hits America’s action severely in an editorial this week,
pointing out not only that our insistence on parity may
cost us billions and bring us out of the conference com-
mitted to an extensive building program, but Lhat it is
stupid. We quot ‘And parity, what is it? A chim-
era. Just as though any two nations could he on a par
even with exactly duplicate ﬂeets when the vital quests
[ion is the brains of the respective commanders, the drill
and efficiency of the crews, their marksmanship, their
will to will.”

But Why accuse America. alone of the impend-
ing failure of the Naval conference? Our action is
merely a manifestation of the general psychology pre—
vailing in the Naval conference and in the world in
general. “When”, cry those who hope for world peace,
”will the statement of the nations see that security can:
not rest ultimately on large armaments and on suspicion
that the other fellow is going to get one leap ahead?”
We recognize the feeling as a natural oneiLhis attitude
of distrust—but did not 1914 [each those who govern
the nations of the world anything? Can it be that in
the face 0f the World War the nations of the World will
again keep to the slogan: “In time of peace prepare
for War?" ’

So it seems today, so it seems at the London cone
ference, where only a miracle can bring tangible re-
sults out of chaos. But how long? There is the
challenge to education today: it must raise up a gen-
station that will say: "What do we care for your naval
technicians and admirals and your spirit of suspicion?
We are Willing to meet the nations of the World half»
Way, and more than halfway if necessary?" And that,
too, is the challenge to the individual college man and
woman. If, and When, it is accepted, naval conferences
will succeed, but until that time, it Will cost far less to
send Secretaries of state on a month‘s vacation to
England to see all the historic sights, including Windsor
castle, rather than to armament conferences of any kind
whatsoever. E. D. A.
