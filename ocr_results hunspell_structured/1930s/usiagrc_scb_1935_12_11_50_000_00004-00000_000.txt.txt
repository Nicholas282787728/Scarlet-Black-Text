(\ colouul or Pure Reality)

That little lapse last week was

'Just in the nature of a teaser, and

to make you a little more anxious
for us to appear this week. We
hope you’ll he pretty happy now
that we’re back.

You’ve probably all li‘enrd by
this time that Virginia Clark mill
Charley linwson have finally
broken the tie that binds. but we
lhong‘ht we’d mention it tor the
beneﬁt oi those that don't. An—
other pair of lot'e-blrLISi who've
cooled oil are Jim stiles and
Judy Hunting, who called it on

~ night. So check them I
t of possible dates.
This is only one of the many
services offered by the Doric.
Contrary to popular opinion and
campus custom. Phyllis Burton
and Mark Conkling are not going
steady. Just another one of those
Platonic friendships. Or is it?

And which of the librarians
ran be so attractive that she can
make “Blimklook” Rushtoii wait
ior her in the cold every night
till she gets through working?
What man will suffer tor his
love!

Gene Leachmnn and Eugenia
Topping are showing all the signs
oi approaching Giinncll matrl-
.mony. (Which means going steady
to you lugs.)

And did you notice the way
the girls’ section in the gym
cheered the other night when-
ever Shorty mntoonoy made an
appearance? which leads us to
wonder just why Shorty has
been on retirement so much inle-
ly.

Here’s something new about the
steady situation. Bruce Badger and
Adelie Woodward are not going
steady. They just don’t date any~
