WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1932
Mm

m Column a] PM Emory.

And with the incoming cold
weather the passing of THOSE
(censored) flys. I hope the little imp
that used to crawl in my bed along
about six pm. and then want to get
up at six a.m. asking permission by
doing handstands and immelan turns
in my ear, will go freeze himself in

a nice big cake of ice.
s e .

And while talking about the had
things of school, it seems that Bob
Morgan, noble Dibbleite, was per—
suaded by Mr. Montgomery and Ward
to part with something like $2.93 for
a georgeous guitar.

Trouhador Morgan declares it is
entirely harmless and will only he
used to string the quadites along,
but we suggest that he come up and
sing to our rats and kid our flies into

unconsciousness.

st:

Able Rosenbloom attributes his
great ability to sell pants so easily
to the effect that he has a persuasive
tongue. that he understands the bare
facts of the best selling principles,
that he understands his customer and
touches his very heart (Oh Marsh-
mallows), and the fact that the
freshmen are very gullible.
e a e

We hope everyone was out to give
Hoover his affectionate greeting. We
saw a whole lot of people there. The
grade school kids with their flags,
the boy scouts with their necker-
chiefs, and the Honor .6 with their
red sweaters were all there en-rnasse,

Herbie likes Grinnell pretty well
(yes he does, he said so) but in Stan-
ford where HE went to school he
could take as many hours as he
wanted to.

Duffy, Pate, and Giddings proved
to be the prize buttoners of the afv
tcmoon.

And how could Mr. Hoover help
but like Grinnell with all those red
hats gathered irlolizingly about his
feet. Freshmen come home.

And while we are talking about
good entertainment (or were wcl you
ought to ask Sally Henderson to tell
you ahout all the flat tires she had
last summer. Every time she went
out she had a flat tire.

To those who would like to get up
on their college life, we suggest about
two and a half hours of ”70,000 (not
70,000 or 7,000 but 70,000) Witnesses."
Some of the freshmen, especially
those of Gates and Clark declare
they've been disillusioned.

x s r

Stan, you should he ashamed of
yourself. What if Mr. Hoover had a
straw vote of who people wanted for
editor of the Malteaser.

x x a

No Roger. although Mr. Hoover has
appeared somewhat piefaced in some
of his earlier pictures, the fact that
he came from Marengo this otters
noon has nothing to do with pie,
Isn't that so, Mrs. Leonard.

s x i

The sick list:

Irma Cooperishe got hurt.

Chuck Woodyihis two scabs have
been respectively the result of falling
out of bed, getting burned by some
live wire (not freshmen) and a fall
out with the ex-wife.

President Jaqua of Scripts College,
Pomona, California, spoke on “The
Conscience.” In the course of his talk
he gave numerous hints to the Fresh—
men such as: Don't try to make an
impression, forget your high school
reputation, forget your home-town
reputation, and don't try to impress
the upper classmen with your clothes.

To conclude he gave the definition
of conscience. It is that thing which
keeps a person from enjoying purtici»
pation in a forbidden act; and he
further warned students not to let
the conscience become too active.

Tuesday

I. P. Ryan, professor of speech
delivered a lecture on “Rules of Life."
He gave the Ten College Command-
ments which he adapted from Hams
let, The chief of these in' importance
is "To thine own self be true, then
as the day follows the night thou
shalt not be false to any man."

Mr. Ryan suggested that any col-
lege student would go for who used
this code of rules during his college
career.

Wednesday

Miss Sara MacDonald and David E.
Peck, both of the Department of Mu-
sic, provided a program of two move»
ments from Sonata number 2, in E
Minor, for violin and piano. The first
of the two selections was an Alle-.

movement.
