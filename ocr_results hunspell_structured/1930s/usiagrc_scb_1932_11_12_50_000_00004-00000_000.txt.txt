Campus Opinion

Question: Do you approvo of the
suggestion that the prooceds of the
Pioneer chest fluid or this year he
used for the recreation center rather
than Grinnell ~China?

Lillie Hagen: I do not think the
proceeds o‘ the Pioneer chest fund
should be given to the recreation cons
ter. This would be a very selfish
thing. The support of Grinnell—in-
China is much. more necessary than
providing an amusement center for
college students.

Nora Porley: I do not believe we
should give the pioneer chest fund to
the recreation center. It would he un—
fair because it is more important
than our pleasures. The proceeds of
the pioneer chest fund should be sent
to Grlnnellrin-Cbina.

Stanley Dyson: I think it would be
a very good idea to give the pioneer
chest fund toward the building or a
recreation center. Crinnell has long
been in need of such a place.

George Marker: I do not believe
we should give the proceeds of the
pioneer chest fund to the recreation
center. While Grinnell is in‘need of
a recreation center Grinnell-in»china
is much more in need of support.

Mildred Duval: Grinnell certainly
lacks a recreation center so why not
use the pioneer chest fund for that?

- Drake Seeks

New Power

Williams Has Three Weeks
. ho Develop Winner

DES MOINES, IA. (Specialliln
the face of overwhelming odds Coach
Bill Williams has three more weeks
in which to develop a winning team.

That he will do this was indicated
Tuesday when the Drake squad. its

workouts in the field house in prep
aration for their last home game as
well as their last conference game of
the season Saturday against Wash»
ington,

New Enthusiasm

Following Monday-s criticism of
the play in the Butler game the Bull—
dogs worked with the enthusiasm of
a team beginning a season rather-
than one nearing the close.

Football coaches agree that the
tackle position is one of the most im-
portant in the line. Coach Williams
had four tackles at the beginning of
the season with a combined weight of
well over 800 pounds. His first blow
was the injury of Fred (Tiny) Blanch,
veteran all-state tackle, playing his
third year on the varsity. Blanck’s
leg was injured early in the season
and i-e-injured in one of the first
games so that for the remainder of
the games this season he has been on
the sidelines. He got into the Grin
nell game for one play and his leg
was injured again so that he could
not make the trip to Butler.

Williams Suffers Blows

The second blow to Coach Williams
was the loss of two of his most prom
ising sophomore tackles, both weigh
ing over zoo pounds, when both were
declared ineligible. only Kokjohn res
mains as a regular tackle. Canakes
a light sophomore, was shifted to
guard and Captain Milo Bowers,
whose regular position was right

guard was shifted to tackle where her

has played a nice game despite his
lack of experience. With Kokjolm out
of the lineup Coach Williams has only
sophomores upon which he may der
pend, and although they lack experi-

ence they are willing and try hard[

enough but lack of weight is another
handicap which only their spirit of
fight is capable of overcoming.
Injuries Hit Team

Much the same position confronts
Coach Williams in regard to ends.
starting the season with as fine a
crop of ends as any team in the con-
ference, injuries have reduced the

number to one end, Deskin, who has‘

not been out of the last few games.
Brechier, veteran wingman, has been
on the sidelines the last two games
and it is doubtful whether he wrll be
able to play this week. Hunt, sopho-
more end, is in the same predicament

 

with an injured ankle, while HaSr

l
ranks thinned by injuries, began theirl

hrouck, another sophomore, is define
itely out for the rest of the season
with a hernia sustained early in the
year,

One bright spot in the line winch
came to light last week at Butlcrl
was the defensive play of Walt Jones I
at center.

Both the coaches and the student
body at Drake are anxious for a win
over Washington this week which
will help their standing in the con-
ference.

RADIO RAMBLINGS

Radio's largest family is the “Myrt
and Marge" cast . . . In the time of
less than a year that the scripts have
been broadcast, more than 125 char--
acters have passed across this studio
stage . . . 35 of them have sufficiently
captured public fancy as to draw fan
mail.

orchestra dispenses torrid tunes,

Birdsall Outstanding
in Homecoming Play

(Continued from page 1}

slightly due to a somewhat too reals
istic bit of acting.
May Floyd Sinex, the only member
of the cast never to have had acting
experience on a Grinnell stage before,
showed real dramatic ability. Her
monologue in one scene was a inas-
terpiece of that difficult phase of
acting.
In the scene that Morgan has de-
lirium tremens while his child, Truly
Trousdalc, is dying, both vied for the
attention of the audience with the rev
suit that some of the action of both
was lost. However Miss Trousdole's
picture of a child was a convincing
bit of acting.
Good Characterization

Wynona Ewaldt and Doris Long,
as the wives of the Innkeeper and
drunkard, portrayed “loving, fore-
bearing wives" in a manner that
showed a clear isight into the char-
acters. Richard Mosena, the Philanr
thropist, struck a note of dignity
throughout the entire performance,
making a charming contrast and
background for the drunkenness,
brawls, and murders, which pervaded
the play.
In keeping with the old style man
ner, members of the cast entertains
ed the audience with songs and danc-
es between thc acts, changing from
their characters to vaudeville with
the ease of taking off and putting on
a cloak.

Professor Grass, One of F irst Honor G :
Club Members, Won Letters In Track.

Grinnell college was one of the
first Schools to introduce sports in
the middle west. according to Donald
F. Grass, professor of business ad-
ministration and a member of the
class of ’94, Professor Grass is, out-
side of the athletic department the
only faculty member of the Honor G
club and also has the distinction of
being one of its first members.

Then Grinnell was Considered largc
in proportion to the other schools of
the state. Together with the state
university and Amos, she ranked as
one of this leading schools in Iowa.

Itivalry High

Rivalry ran high between the state
university and Grinnell, but soon the
former became much larger than
Grinnell and entered the Big Ten con-
ference. Then she ceased to play
against Grinnell, and Ames and Grin-
hell began a rivalry that lasted until
about ten years ago. At that time
Drake took Ames’ place as Grinnell‘s
greatest rival.

In 1890, Grlnuell had her first footr
ball team, and played against the
State university and Minnesota. T. U.
Lyman Of Hartford, Conn, was the
captain of that successful [23:13.

On Track 1mm
The following year the first track

 

team was organized, and ran against
the other two teams of the state at
Iowa City. Marshalltown was the
scene of the contest in '92. 9

While in school here Professor-
Grass was a member of the track
teams which competed against the
state university and Amos in '93 and
'94. It was this team which helped to
win for Grinnell her first trophy Gupta
which she was allowed to keep in her
possession after winning it three con-
secutive years.

Some years after Professor Grass
had graduated, the Honor G club was
formed, and all of the men who had
won first place in the events were
brought together and made‘mcnibers
of the club. At that time the club did
not sponsor a homecoming dance, for
in the first place dancing was banned
and in the second homecoming as it is
now, did not exist. If there were any
homecoming at all, it was at corn-
mencement when many alumni re.
turned to visit.

PERSONALS
James Hakes returned to classes
Monday after a short stay at the
Community hospital where he was
taken Friday for treatment of a se-
vere cold.
