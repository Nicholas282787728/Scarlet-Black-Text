CREDIT WHERE IT’S DUE

Another Student council will take office
shortly and it seems only fitting at this time
to pause and consider what tlle outgoing
Council has accomplished

It is easy to be a cynic and charge the stu—
dent government on this campus With being
useless, and sometimes such criticism is just -
fled. However, We think that such an atti-
tude has tended to get out of hand at times,
and that credit has not always been given
where credit is due. We believe that such is
especially the case ill regard to the Student
council.

The present Council has accomplished
much more than the student body seems to
realize. It has done much of its work \ ith~
out any ostentation, for such all attitude
would have hindered the work.

But this is not all. The Council has done
much that could have been publicly recogniz—
ed had the campus been willing to do so. Ull-
der the direction of Kent Duncan, retiring
president, the Council has drawn up and sub-
mitted to the campus tu'o auditing plans for
the reorganization of the handling- 01' funds
of campus groups. The first proposal was

voted down, but the latter ollc was 3131)‘ \‘ed,
and is now functioning, thus pro iding a
means of more adequately handling such
matters.

Not only that but the Council has also come
pletcly loot-gallizcd the allotment of the
solncst ‘ ices ill order to assure nlol'c \\‘Ol'til-
u'hilc thing's for the students. And also the
Council has conducted the election of its suc-
cessor with the utmost rapidity, a thing- that
has long been a rarity in Student council clece
tinns. ‘

These certainly can not be called trivial
matters, and they show What can and has
been done through student government. Now
that the present administration is about to
leave office, it seems only fair to give credit
Where credit is due, and certainlll tllc outgo—
ing Student council dcscrrcs cl'cdit for have
ing made itself a really useful part of the
campus life and government here.

THE V.F.\Vl7A POWER?
(Daily Trojan)

“Boys will be boys,” as the old saying goes, and
with the rapid spread of the latest youth organiza-
tion, the Veterans of Future Wars, once molc is
demonstrated the ability of the younger generation
to build a mere idea into something of tremendous,
though perhaps only temporary, importance.

Certainly there is, beneath the apparent fi-ivolity
and reactions quality which marks the history of
the future veterans up to tlus point, an underlying
current of potency and a tin-eat to the bonus seekers
and pension awaitcrs who throng the capital and
spend most of their time lobbying.

Conceived by a group of Princetonians as a satiri-
cal more to belabor certain “100 per cent American"
organizations who specialize in “making the world
safe for democracy," the Veterans of Future W'ars
and their ans iary, the Future Gold Star Mothers.
have Sprcad with little advertising and with little
publicity; and, if their present growth continues, the
future veterans may have the opportunity of become
ing one of the strongest forces for international
peace yet devised.

Fal'rfetchetl’! Perhaps. Yet entirely possible: for
ridicule is a sure method of destroying faith, it faith
there be, in hypocritical groups who profess loyalty
and patriotismﬁnd yet demonstrate that loyalty
and that patriotism in no way whatsoever.

The power that lies in the hands of the Veterans
of Future Wars perhaps has not been fully realized.
Yet the logic behind such a movement is more sen-
sible than is realized by a superficial study. The
cbsurrl platforms, the cry for pensions and bonuses
and trips to Europe for the Future Gold star Moths
ers are all only satirical jibes; the real motive, an
expression of the true feelings of young America,
lies semi hidden, but discernible to those who will
look,

Perhaps the sensational rise of the Veterans of
Future Wars is a warning of what may come it
strained international situations are not eased
through the logic and intelligence which could solvc
such problems, but have failed to do so.

suppose that it is better alter

things like war and peace and

Following the collapse of the
Vets, a spurious fly-bymight or-
ganization sprang up. Dick Cozatl
{is reported to have sponsored the
movement, which held that the
government was paying for every-
thing else, sc why shouldn't it pay
our college bills. Cozad declared
that the organization would Spon-
sor a bill in Congress to pay each
college student 69c for each class
not attended, just as the farmer
is paid for hogs not raised. (\Vc
think this is silly, and we will cer-
tainly not sponsor such a group.)
