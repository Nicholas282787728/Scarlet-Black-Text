However. the group has designed a pl-ogrnlll
which. on the, surface at least. appears to meet tlle
requirements. .»\ number of quite drastic changes
are include in the new plan.

0n the fi .1 four (IIH of each work the pl'nr
gram will include a brief llk by one of the hotter
faculty speakers. on a topic of intellectual intelr
cst. alld one or two musical numbers, The tallis will
lie planned in scrie so thit two, three, or even
more succeeding speeches will be on tile smile llroad
topic. It is hoped tllat ill this manner interest ill
the programs can be carried over from day to day.

The Friday program of each week will be one
tirely different from the preceding four. Oll tll .
day the time will be devoted to student chapels. or
to music or some, other typo of elltcrtailllllent. Th s
program will be ill no \ ly a devotional service, and
applause will be encouraged.

The final change ill plan concerns the all-
nonneelnellt of chapel programs ill advance. The
topics of all talks and the speaker who will present
them. as well as the programs for the special Fri-
day chapels, will be made public well ill advance so
that students lilay have the opportunity of know-
ing each day exactly what is planned for that day’s
program

There is a real need for a daily ellapcl program
on Grinnell campus, but in the past, or at least
since attendance has been voluntary, the services
have not adequately filled this need. The new com-
mittee is to be commended for its genuine effort
to improle the existing system and, with tl co
opclation of the students, sllould make the, 1.0 -I-
chapel program of genuine value to the sthool.

TEACHING THE EASY \VAY
(Dnily Tar Heel)

A numb’er of the highly respectable gentlemen who
grace our facility have been muttering imprccations at a
student body, which has, they say, decided to a man not
to do any work. In the course of the spring quarter pol.
itics, hell week, athletics, dances, festivals, the movies
and spring fever have all been variously blamed, and the
faculty is justly weary of finding one excuse after an-
other for what it is pleased to consider blank faces and
empty heads. Chapel Hill has been humming with
activity this spring. and, as usual. the humming has not
been done entirely by visitors. Perhaps the learned gcnr
tlemen are correct when they say that there has been too
much humming, but it alone is not to blame for empty
heads, nor is it the lure of a midnight meal down town
Which can wholly account for drooping necks and empty
seats in class.

Miraculously enough, there are some professors who
are not day by day confronted with the spectacle of a
washed-out, dragged-down, and world-weary class, fal-
tering pencils in their hands, stumbling lies upon their
lips. For there are some professors who have the enthu-
siasm and the vitality and the energy to vitalize abstrac-
tions, to recreate a dead past till it glows with life and
animation, to give a semblance of life to the meanest,
lowest creatures in the universe, or to throw out chal»
lenging suggestions faster than you can get to Durham.
With such instructon, work is a pleasure that even the
most orving spirits do not deny themselves very often.
The whines and wails and wheezes of protest do not have
their source in professors who have interest, erudition
and enthusiasm enough to keep their classes interested

Anybody must be perfectly aware that it is far easi-
er to mumble a polite “This you will be held responsible
for," or “This you are required to memorize than to
stimulate such enthusiasm for information that the stu
dent's own self-respect will demand of him that he come
to grips with his subject. And it is further obvious that
it is easier to mark a paper which hands a professor
back his lectures in slightly sprightlier style than one
which is at pains to disagree with him on reasonable
grounds. But if professors take the easiest way, what
can theyiwhat have they the right toiexpect of the
students?

Tuesday

At the last chapel of the academic
year, Richard sterner, instructor
applied Christianity, spoke on the
appreciation of poetry in commemor~
ation of this week, National Poetry
Week.

“Poetry,” he said, “is that which
distinguishes us as cultured from
merely civilized." He continued this
thought by stating that real poetry,
truly successful poetry, is that which
leads into life and not that which
provides an escape.

Before reading a few selections of
American poets, the speaker empha-
sized that although everyone is not
able to bend words to his will, every-
one is a poet. All that is necessary is to
see truth emotionally and in expressA
ing this truth not to overbalanee or
distort its validity,
