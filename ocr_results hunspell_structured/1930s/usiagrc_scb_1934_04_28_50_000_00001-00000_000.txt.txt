Fail in Trials
at Relay Meet

Purdue Sets Medley Mark;
Louisiana Star Breaks
Shot Put Record '

Running against the stiffest kind
of opposition in the preliminary tri-
als, the Grinnell mile relay team
placed fourth in its heat at the
Drake Relays Saturday, but failed to
qualify for the finals in the event.

The heat was won by the Univer-
sity of California at Los Angelcs.
Iowa placed second and Notre Dame
third in the heat The time of 3:174
was the fastest turned in during the
preliminaries.

World Record Sct

Meeter railed to qualify in the
shot put, and Mcllrdth, McKlveen,
Gordon and Pheiffer, who entered in
the distance medley, went unplaccd
in that event. In the shot put. Jack
Torrance, giant Louisiana State ath-
lete, shattered the world record
with a heave of 55 feet 1y2 inches,
bettering the former mark by more
than two feet. The shortest toss to
qualify was 44 feet ‘Il/2 inches.

In the distance medley a new
Drake record was set by Purdue.
with a time of 10. 5.3. The old mark
of 10:19.1 was set by Indiana in
1932.

Milcrs May Run

This afternoon Pheiffer was to
run in the two-mile event or, with
Gordon, Mcllrath and Halsey, Stauss
or Marker, in the four-mile relay.
Yesterday Les Duke, track coach,
was still in doubt as to which event
he should enter Phelffer in. Grinnell
won the championship for the four
mile event at last year's relays.

Finals in the Silvcr Anniversary
running of the Drake Relays were
scheduled to start at 2 o‘clock this
afternoon. Outside of the shot put
and distance medley records, no new
marks were set in the university
events yesterday. The 14.4 record
of the late George Saling in the 120-
yard high hurdles was tied, however,
by Sam Allen, Oklahoma Baptist
sophomore.

his hands apart. that he would like
to eat 2| meal “that large."

Tests Taken

“The fast is being conducted strict

ly as a scientific experiment. with

both physiological and psychological

tests," explains Brown, who is by no
means an ascetic.

“I was personally interested in
fasting and made a study of it even
before I came to college," he says.
This is the first fast of more than
two days' duration that he has made,

Room Ruling

Dormitory Council Will Act
to Alter Regulation

A point of disagreement over the
recently approved plan for dormitory
room apportionment for next fall was
revealed at the weekly meeting of
the Council of House Presidents held
in the dormitory little dining room
Thursday evening

Taking advantage of the ruling
giving council members preference in
choicc of rooms, a member of the
council had made application for a
suite of rooms occupied by two under
classmcn who desired to retain the
suite next year, while recognizing
the justice of the present residents'
plea, the council decided that the
council member had a technical right
to the room if he chose to back up
his application. The council is consid-
ering a rule, however, which will do-
cidc such controversies in the future,

The council also laid plans for e -
tcrtaining the senior men of Grin-
ncll high school at open houses next
Friday and at dinner on the follow—
ing Sunday evening.

Furthci- business included plans
for procuring musical entertainment
for the dormitory dining room during
meals, and for investigating the pos-
sibilities of having a janitor for the
men’s gymnasium, who would rc-
ceivevfllll board in return for his
work.
