Poet Takes 25 Yeiirs to Complete
Plan of Great American Efoic

Neihiardl Tells Reporter
How He Started
Work in 1912

By Frances C. Hanson

Twentyrflve years to complete
the Epic Cycle of the West is the
heroic task which Mr. John G. Nei-
hardt. famed American poet. set
for himself in 1912, Now he is
within two years of that goal. with
four of the five parts of the cycle
written and published. and the last
ready to be written.

Mr. Ncihardt lectured on his
works and road from them last
evening in Herrick chapel. under
the sponsorship of the lecture
course. He read the death scene of
the sioux Indian. Crazy Horse.
from his "Song of the Indian
Wars.” and several of his shorter
lyrics. including "Let Mc Live Out
My Years.”

Describes Origin

In an interview earlier in the
day. he described the origin and
evolution of the cycle. “The major
outiinc of the cycle came as one
great inspiration." he said. "I
knew from the rirst how it would
come out. but filled in the back-
ground gradually.”

The five heroic narrative poems
which comprise the whole epic are.
“The Song of Three Friends." "The
Song- of Hugh Glass.” “The Song of
ch Smith." “The Song of the Ins

Song of Jed Smith” arc completed.
“Jed Smith." he declared, “was the
greatest of our American explor-
ers He led the first band of
Americans through south pass
across to the Pacific and so opened
the entire west to settlement.”
Poet a Tiny Man

The poet is a tiny man with a
>mane of grey hair. piercing eyes
and a vibrant voice which makes
‘him seem twice his size. As he told
‘of the Indian battles. one seemed
to see the whole panorama untold
and come to life. Mr Neihardt disc
likes the term. Indian specialist. as
applied to himself.

i "I am interested in the Indians
as an example of thc cntire human
race." he stated. “We are all esscnr
Itially the same. but the Indians
nature is less complex than that of
.the white man. and therefore easi-
cr to portray.”
Lived Among Indians

During the years he lived with
the Indians. 1901 to 1907. Mr. Nei-
hardt became acquainted with
their. sccrs, who. he says. really
have seen visions. basically the
same as those which all mystics.
such as St. Francis of Assisi. have
seen. He explained his theory of
‘Lhe “burden of strangeness” which
all of us hear. and which builds a
wall between us so that we do not
really know our best friends.

“If this wall could be dropped.”
he declared. “we should see that
all life is one. whether it is based

Peterson Claims
Public Schools

Face Crisis

That the public schools or Iowa
face a financial crisis was main~
taincd by Mr E. T. Petelson, pro-
fcssor of school administration in
the graduate school at tho Unir
vcrsity of Ion-a. in his address to
a group of education students in
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium
Thursday night.

"The people of Iowa are pressing
the legislature for aholi on of the
property tax. which
sour-cc of income for the public
schools." Mr. Peterson stated.
“Abolition of this tax would leave
thc public schools no means of Slip—
port and would reduce their effi
'ciency to a great extent.”

Professor Peterson offered as a
solution the suggestion that the
school taxes should be changed to
hum of taxation other than the
‘pi'operty tax. Possible sonices of
thc new school tax could he the
ocgarettc. gasoline and sales tax.
the speaker asserted. He personally
believes that the gasoline tax
would be the best source of revee
line. since the income is especially
large and there is already a sur»
plus.

A tired and weakened Pioneer
basketball team will attempt to
break even on the current road trip
by defeating the high ﬂying
Creighton Bluejays tonight in
Omaha. The Grinnellians, handi-
capped by the sudden loss of Julius
Bauer. veteran center. and having
lost to Drake 47-30 last night.
have but an outside chance of scor-
ing a victory.

In addition. the Pioneers will be
seeking to break a jinx of ten
years' standing. which has never
permitted the Grinnellians to de-
feat the Jays on the basketball
court. Since 1926 the two schools
have played 15 games with Creigh-
ton winning ail of the encounters.

Comparative Scores

By comparative scores the Grin-
nclilans should have a chance to
win. but the sudden losses have up-
set such calculations. so far this
year Grinnell has defeated the Ok—
‘lahoma Aggies 31721. and the Ag-
gics beat Creighton 32-22. On the
other hand, Grinnell lost to the
Washington Bears 34733 and the
Jays trounced the Bears 44713.
Creighton also defeated the Tiiisa
Hurricanes 32-31. while the Tul-
sans bowled over the Grinnellians
28-23. Thus. by comparative scores.
the outcome seems to he a toss—up.

Creighton will send an all veter-
lan team onto the floor tonight.
with the scoring attack being built
around Emil “Box" Engelbretson.
