turned in to the athletic depart-
ment after each day's play.

must be played each Friday or
Saturday of the season, the cards
to be turned in to the golf man-
ager who will be named soon.

in the week-end qualifying match-
es will be set as a basis for
awarding numeral winners,” Triies—

dale Said.
“The final numeral winners will

be limited to the top group of
the squad."

Ever Curse College Central?
She Has Her Problems, Too

Hook Jigglei‘s, Date
Seekers Are Few of
Operator’s Peeves

Erlllm'i Mia.- The it the [ml in a "on
one. of nrliclcs an mmpio pal gccvls.
Did you ever wonder why, on
some occasions, college central
greets you cheerily, even happily,
when on other occasions her voice
darts out at you in a cobra-like
fashion, oozing with venom?

It seems that even as popping
telephone receivers and wrong
numbers irritate the individual
making a phone call. the latter
has habits equally aggravating to
the operator. Nevertheless, here
are presented a few of the worst
pests who make this anything but
a happy world for “college cen-
trals'.”

Hook .yiggiers

First and foremost is he who
jiggles the receiver book, an act
which gu‘arantees leisurely, if any
service.

Runnermp for top ranking pest
honors, is the gent who asks the
name of Dorothy something-or-
other in Read, or the tall blond
in Mears; and with that as the
only clue, wants to know if the
aforementioned is a good dancer,
if she is busy tonight, and win
the operator connect him up.

The switch board operator
screams at this point that she is
NOT a dating bureau!

Disorganioed [killers

Another who makes maniacs of
college centrais is the supremely
inattentive caller who, at the re-
sponse of the operator, requires
30 seconds of "oh-ing" and
"ah-ing" before he can get oiu
ganized and recall who he is,
what he is doing, and why.

Neither are these pusher-and-
puller-of-plugs mind readers. Peo-

with their party again.

Homecoming Agony

The young ladies who refuse to
answer a call and then rush to
the phone to ascertain its source
also make the operators break
the Ten Commandments.

The final bit of agony comes
during Homecoming when ope-
rators have to plug from Mears
to Read and from Smith to
Dibble for Schmaltz '94, McGiili-
cudy '98, or Phillips ’66!

post would call f a juggling of
the present backfield. Fred Ho-
mann, hard-hitting senior full-
back, could take over the job
with his boots being filled by Bob
Hamann, a sophomore with triple-
threat potentiaities.

Homann is a sure bet in the
backfield, as is Robinson at quar-
terback. But who will team with
Bob Moehi at half to be the
fourth man for the Pioneers, is
something that Lookabaugh will
probably decide at game time Sat-
urday.

No Further Changes

The rest of the Pioneer starting
team will remain unchanged.
Capt. Burke Powers and Paul
Balchly will be at the ends; LesLer
Shepard and Bob Jones. tackles;
Max Shelton and High, at the
guards, with Howard Grimes at
center.

Recalling the Tutors' aptness
for returning kickoffs in the 1937
game, which ended in a 20 to 20
tie, Lookabaugh is working with
the squad to prevent a similar
disaster this year.

in addition, the Pioneers have
been given some new plays and
will be strengthened by the re-
turn of two members of last
year's squadiEd Vaughn, a cen-
ter, and Russell Berg, tackle.
