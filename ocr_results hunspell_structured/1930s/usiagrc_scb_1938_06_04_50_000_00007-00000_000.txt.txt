facilities, the trackmen turned in
some good team performances,

dual meet with North Central
college and placing second in the

two co-captains, John Hayward
and Lynn Schlotterbeck. Hayward

ling decathalon contest at the
illinois relays while Schlotterheek
broke a record at North Central
in the 440 and placed third against
the best in the middlewest in the

3.000 yard run at Illinois.

The Beloit relays was easily the
standout performance for the
Pioneers in both the indoor and
outdoor seasons. Competing
against 17 midwest colleges, all

Pioneers ran off with the meet

The team also heat Coe in a
dual meet and did well at the
State Teachers relays. In the
final meet of the year, they
placed fourth in the Missouri

most consistent performers all

broad jump. To him goes the
distinction of heing the only
Pioneer athlete to place in the
Drake relays,

The co-captainseelect, Fred Lu»
ther and Vern Robinson, also
turned in some sparkling pere
formances. The latter’s improve—
ment in the pole valut during the
season was one of the high lights
of the year from the standpoint
of individual performances.

formances of Ted Appelquist,
