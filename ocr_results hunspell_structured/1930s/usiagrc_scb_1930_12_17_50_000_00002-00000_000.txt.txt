SPENDING ENDOW‘MENTS

Grinncll has been considerably harassed in

recent years by.thc need of endowment; for ill
Spite of the generosity of Grinnell’s, friends, it
takes a tremendous amount of money to run a col—
lege if only a few per cent of the money is avail-
able in any one year. Grinncll’s problem has been
further complicated by tile fact that the Rocke-
feller foulldation, which might alleviate the troue
blcs, considers the investing of endowment in. dor-
mitorics an improper use of pcrpetuities,
. The proposal that money should not be given
in permanent endowments is therefore exceedingly
interesting to Gz-inncllians. This is the suggestion
made by Julius Rosellwold, w.cll known philanthro:
pist and trustee of Chicago university He thinks
money should be donated to be spent within one
to 10 years; and that if building improvements are
the need of the moment, the institution’s holdings
should be available for the purpose.

Thcrc is in Mr. Rosenwald’s suggestion more
than more convenience to institutional administra-
tors. He belicvcs that institutions outlive their use-
fulness, and yet insist on perpetuating themselves
because they are so deeply rooted in land, brick
and stone, and “AA” bonds. ..

Institutions are the servants of humanity when
they are young, while the men who run them are
interested in the ideals for which they were found-
cd. But when the institutions get old, the men
think not of ideals but of institutions only, and
both become a curse. Perhaps Mr. Rosenwald has
suggested the cur

THE YUIrE LOG

Sunday night the annual quadrangle Yule log
service was held with conspicuous success. Tllc
service has become an inseparable part of the quad-
rangle year. It has conic to include, during the
length of its c istcllcc. practically all the phases
of zl Gl‘lllllell woman’s life. Started in 1915 as a port
of the Killing Woman’s Christian association, it
now embraces bcsidos this, the league, the dermis
tory supervise , and the faculty.

The symbolism of the service is apparent. The
wreath nlcalls the jus completed year, with the
twilicd branches, the fl' 't and the bow of red. Tllc
fragment of, tllc original 10;: links this your with
previous years and shows the present as an out-
growth of the past. All of this would mean nothing
if the service were not minutely planned and car-
ried out. In its present form there is the minimum
of theorizing and sentimentality.

Particularly gratifying is the realization that
the Yule log service is peculiar to Grillncll, and
that its uniqueness is well guarded. Yule log has
made its place in the calendar of, tllc quadrangle,
and will he supplanted only in the far future and
with protest.

THE RUMMAGE SALE.

The officers of the Young Men’s Christian as
sociation have been investigating the conditions
under which it is going to be necessary for the
poorer element of. Grinncll’s population to pass
through the wintor. The situation is vcry serious
for nlany of tllcm. Winter is hard enough for the
loss financially ablc families any year, and on such
years as this, When there is scrious economic (lee
prcssion with resulting lack of work, such pcoplc
suffer hardship. Thcy lack the necessities of life,
especially clothing and proper shelter sufficient to
the cold weather. .

The house chairmen have all agreed to coopcratc
with the Y.M.C.A. ill collecting at house mcctmgs,
all the old clothes which Grinncl students arc will
ing to give. There remains only one thing neces-
sary to make the drive a llugc success and that is
the cooperation of the men of the dormitories. Mon
students have some things that they will not use
again anyway. Contribute them to those who need
them more.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DEMOCRACY IN ENGLAND

,\ cartuiu rcputalilo element ol' the populace of
England has isollrll a strong Illl‘r’t for a cabinet of
ﬁvo men with tho pilll'uls ol‘ dictatorship. ’l‘hc cllls

Possibly this situation results from the Pilot

lint to consider a dictatorship? Of course the
plan advocated is not a dictatorship ill its strongest
Sousa. It is the use of a cabinet of fivr men, but the
powers or this group would make the govcl-umcnt
virtually a dictatorship. It would be a huge changc
for England. There have been historians wllo have
claimed, since tlic Brycc book, that England was
more of a democracy than the United States. Is
that democracy failing already.

All of this propaganda and "poppycock" mllst
not bc taken too scl’iously, howcvcr. Just because
a few rcspollsiblc men on England advocate a new
plan of goverllnlcnt, there is no reason to holicvc
that anything will come of it. Britons are not so
constituted that they could appreciate a dictator»

PARROTING THOUGHTS

The claim is made that students are being in-
structed in the mistakes of the last 400 ycal's. If
this be so, What can they llopc for the future but
the addition of more mistakes to hc taught to the
following generations? .

Where arc students going? It is to be hoped
th. , they will make a greater advance ill the line
of pure education than has been made in this coun—
tr, in the comparatively short years of student
instruction. Is Grinucll approaching the German
sclfrcontrol of studies, or is it to continue. the
parrotiug of book-learned thoughts to all instructor
for the sake of a gradc?

It is probable that in a short time students
will be absolutely frcc from tho hindrance of
grades, for though they constitute an incentive
through fear, they do not bring out a true spirit
of learning. Collcgiaus cram for exams and classes
not for the purpose of learning to think for them-
selves. bllt to gain an advance in grade. Tllc know»
ledge gained is generally nil, but still the system
sccms to lncrit popularity by tile claim that it
makes everyone study.

Why study in mass production? If a student
doesn’t really desire to gain control of his mind
by the discipline of study, he Will never do so by
compulsion. Study should be based on a funda-
mental desire to increase initiative for the acquir-
ing of future knowledge. Training by disciplined
learning is the best manner to acquire this. Can
this honestly be done under threat?

Grades under the present system form a cer-
tain drawback and even a certain amount of social
stigma, for they separate the student from his in—
structors. A student cannot visit all instructor, a
practice often desirable to many students with
problems that need solution by a more mature
mind, The student often would like a free cxcllangc
of ideas with an instructor, for a student has, alld
should have, ideas on all subjects which come with
in his range of study and thought, Can he do this?
He may have the courage to do so, but it is dis-
couraging to personal initiative to be constantly
reminded that he is only doing so to gain a grade
from the instructor. The instructor should be a
loader to tllosc under him, who are striving to ﬁt
themselves for a place in society, and he cannot
be the desired leader when he is an aloof ﬁgure
secn only across a desk, or through the gradc rc-
ports.

True the system of eliminating grades would
make college a pleasant four year loaf for many
men and women, but at least those desiring to
learn to think would have their chance, and thcy
are the only ones wllo will learn for themselves
in the end.

Perhaps Grimlcll should begin to look forward
to soc where it is going. It would be disastrous
not to have thought of a type of future training
which must surely supplant thc present one, for
without change there is no progrc'ss, and without
progress what use is mental training?

COLLEGE NEWSPAPER INFLUENCE

(From the Beloit Round Table)

Freedom of speech, the relation of the college news-
paper to the professional press, and its power of mould-
ing and reﬂecting campus opinion have been receiving
attention at two press conferences at Pittsburgh, and
William and Mary college, because of the attacks suf~
tercd by many dating editors this year.

B. K. Hart, member of the Providence Journal
staff, says: “The college newspaper is the cradle of our
newspaper men. By all means, anyone expecting to go
into journalism should work on his school newspaper,
He gets an idea of What the Work behind the scenes is
like . . . College papers shoud contain political news in
proportion to the interest {or it. . , But I do not believe
that the editors have the right to comment or Write
editorials on current events. They can hardly ever ex~
press the opinion of the ma'ority of the college. They
bring too great s'responsibility on themselves."

Apropos of the meeting of the Virginia Intercollegi—
ate Press association, the Virginia Tech says: "It was
evident from the meeting that college periodicals, par-
ticularly the newspaper, are a most important factor in
college life; and the question naturally arose, from the
newspaper standpoint, as to the extent to which camp-
us opinion is affected by editorial comment. In this re-
spect, we personally, are a little pessimistic. We agree
that a newspaper may be or interest to students as far
as campus events are concerned, but we doubt if much
change or action comes as a result of the statement of
the views of the College editor . . . Thus most college
editorials go unread or n‘re casually looked over with
no idea or being weighed as regards any sound merit
they may possess."
