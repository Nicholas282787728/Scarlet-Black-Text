Tbe best tobacco for pipes

comes from Kentucky. . cmcl it’s
called "White Barley”

WE use White Burlcy in making
Granger Rough Cut. It comes

from the Blue Grass region of Kentucky
—ripe, mild leaf tobacco that just about
stops them all for fragrance and ﬂavor.

From the right place on the stalk we
select the kind that’s best for pipes. Then
we make it into Granger by Wellman’s
Method and cut it up into big shaggy ﬂakes.

White Burley tobacco—made the way
old mall Wellman taught us how to make
it— that’s Granger.

"Cut rough to smoke cool”
is the way pzpe smokers
describe Granger—try it
