Grinnell Loses
to Washington
in Tennis, ‘5 to 1

Only Two of Six Matches

Extend to Full Limit
of Three Sets.

Jones Beats Wiese

Captains of Teams Battle Hard
With Pioneer Racqueteer
Winning, 6.0, 9-7.

The Grinnell college tennis team
lost to the net representatives of
Washington university of st. Louis
here yesterday, 5 to 1. Donald Jones,
Grinnell's captain and . number one
man, was the only winner for the
Pioneers, taking the Bears’ number
one man, Wiese, 6-0, 9—7.

Two of the other matches were
sufficiently close to keep the
spectators on edge most of the time.
namely the one in which Tietjen,
Washington's number two man. beat
Kent, Grinnell, 6-2 9—7, and the dou-
bles match in which Wiese and Tie—
tl'en heat Jones and Kent in three
sets which were packed full of thrill—
ing rallies and long driving duals,
the score being, 2-6, 10—3, 6-4.

Jones Goes Good

The ﬁrst feature match of the cf-
ternoon found Jones sweeping aside
his opposition with powerful fore-
hand and backhand drives which
proved too much for Wiese. He
breezed through the ﬁrst set with
out the loss of a single game, but the
second set found the two men match-
ing drive for drive from backcourt,
or alternately advancing to the net
to challenge the other's backcourt
placements.

It was only after a ﬁerce battle
that the Bears’ double combination
of Wiese and Tietjen took Jones and
Kent. The latter have played to-
gether for eight years, and their
teamwork was beautiful to watch
during the ﬁrst part of the match.
They often succeeded in bringing
Wiese and Tietjen together in the
center of the court and then drove

down the sidelines for points, or on ‘

other occasions placed shots directly
between the Bears' doubles combina-
tion which neither of the Washington
men could touch. The latter half of
the match was a different Story,
with the Beers' duo nutsteadying
Grinnell’s doubles team in long ralli-
es, and victory going to Washington
as a result.
Kent Puts Up Fight

Kent, Grinnell’s number two man,
put up a good ﬁght against Tietjen,
but though their match was full of
long rallies, the Bears' netster was
a little too steady. For a time in the
second set Kent’s chances looked
rosy, but he failed to make me best
of his opportunities and lost the
match.

Allen and Lindauer also had some
interesting points, but the Washing-
ton man served fewer double faults,
and played with a little less caution
to win, 6.2, 6-2. Allen’s serve and
forehand drive were effective when
they went in, but showed the need
of further practice. He did, how—
ever, show marked improvement over

Shultz Speaks ,
at Liberal Club

‘Law—Breaker Not Unsocial,’
Des Moines Attorney .
’ Says Thursday. '

“A law-breaker is not always un-
social," said Victor Shultz, Des
Moines attorney and editor of the
Maizeland press, in speaking before
the open meeting of the Liberal club
Thursday evening.

“We ought to smuggle in all the
books barred by the new tariff, 'and
hand them around. This law would
have barred the books of Voltaire
and Rousseau which caused the Am-
erican revolution. We ought to
write radical hooks to take the place
of those that are barred, and hand
them around." Mr. Shultz went on.
“We think that Way about books las-
cause we have been taught to. Do
we have a right to say that people
who feel that way about prohibition
shall be punished?"

Dr. Charles J, Dutton, Des Moines
Unitarian minister, also defended re»
fusal to comply with the Volstead
law. “The battle through which the
fugitive slave law was opposed was
led by the Unitarian and Congrega-
tional churches with the policy, ‘Re~
sist the Iaw,’ he asserted.

sound of revelry by night¥”

Lord Byron was having no pipe dream when he talked about revelry by
night, for it was right on hand here Friday night when the crowd of fans at
the Drake relays turned their attentions to celebrating, but for Grinnellians
the darkness which covered the city was like a. shroud for depai‘ted hopes.
The Pioneers failed to qualify in any events Friday afternoon.

DES ‘MOINES.~There may have

Johnston Declares;

Bribery Qbsolete

Legislative bribery has become
obsolete in an age of lobbying, de~
clares Prof. A. v. Johnston of the
political science department of Grin-
nell college in an article on “High
Pressure Politics” in the May issue
of The Tanager.

Mr. Johnston points out that lob-
bying though not new, has recently
become so general that even those
who oppose its methods are almost
invariably members of organizations
which maintain lobbies.

“The capital of the nation," he
writes, “is being transformed from
an arena of debate and discussion by
the people's elected representatives
to a battleground of organized
groups representative of industry
and ﬁnance, agriculture and labor,
professional people and reformers.

“Basic economic interests have al-
ways wielded a dominating inﬂuence
in government, whether they were
ship owners or land owners, mer—
chants or manufacturers."

Spanish Students Will Give
One-Act Play on Thursday

“No Smoking!” [No Fumadores)
is the one-act play which members
of the Spanish classes will give in
the Alumni Recitation hall auditor—
ium next Thursday evening. All
students are invited to attend.

The scene is laid in a non-smok—
ing section of a train, where E1 Sen-
or meets senora and senorita and
the conversation of the play begins.

 

, The narrowness by which Grinnell
missed joining the coveted ranks of
the select few to compete .in the
ﬁnals Saturday was enough to make
the results even more saddeninge
for the Pioneer mile relay team, run-
ning in the fastest heat of the pro-
liminaries, made a valiant bid for a
'place.

Thomas ran the ﬁrst quarter- for
the Pioneers and as the men round-
ed the curve on the home stretch the
announcer was heard to drone,
“Welch of Missouri is leading,
Thomas of Crinnell, second, Seymour
of Michigan running third.”‘ Ed-
wards slipped back to fourth almost
at once after the pass and held to
that position until he, too, was com-
ing down the Stretch. He matched
Beckner of Iowa stride for stride and
started post, only to be forced back
as the Hawkeye speedster stepped
over into the lane in front of him.

Grinncu Takes Fourth

Pelletier, fresh and game, started
again to pass the lowans,’ but as he
evened himself with Depping an arm
suddenly jolted him back into,fourth
again. it was Grinn'ell's last bid for
a leading place in the«procession and
the lows team. which lost to the P' -
neers at Kansas, qualified while Grin-
nell came in fourth.

Douglas almost qualiﬁed in the
high jump, going right up to the
qualifying height of ﬁve feet eleven,
inches only to miss at that height by
a ﬂick of an elbow. He did not com ‘
pate in the broad jump. Grinnell did
not enter men in the javelin throw,‘
shot put or pole vault, and Murray
failed to near the necessary distance"
in the discus throw as Engleman of
South Dakota tossed the plate 143
9—10 feet.

Grinnell’s medley team failed to
ﬁnish in the medley relay after Ed-
wards ﬁnished the ﬁrst half mile
thirteenth in a race in which thir—
ten were entered. Thomas ran next
in the relay and gained a few yards
on the leaders before Murphy took
up the battle over a threeequarters
mile distance.

Pioneers Drop Out

Murphy bit a sturdy pace the ﬁrst
half mile and pulled up to tenth, but
in the ﬁnal quarter dropped back
again and Gl'innell's bespectacled
miler, Mcnrath, stood at the line
with his hands on his hips and wait-
ed while passes were made‘ on all

Grinnell May Play
Three Golf Matches

No further golf matches have been
deﬁnitely scheduled for the Grinnell
golf team. Negotiations are being
carried on with several schools in-
cluding the University of Iowa and
Drake; '

it is hoped that at least three
more matches will be held, including
a return match with the Hawkeye
golfers at the Grinnell Country club
in the near future. At present the
Pioneer golf outﬁt is composed of
Capt. Meredith Heldridge, DeWitt
McCreary, John Lund and James
Davis.

Coach John Truesdsle is also en-
deavoring to schedule a dual match
with Drake for the Pioneer fresh-
men. Candidates for the frosh team
include Burton Holmes, Max Ross.
George Robinson, Alan Roth and
Linus Soutbwick.
