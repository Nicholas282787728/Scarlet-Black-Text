‘fourney’s End, Rehearsals Present Problemsﬂoflstagl’ngif;
Scenery Falls; Man Dies; Actors Eat -- Stage Crew Labors

 

By John Marion.

“Journey’s End" rehearsals are
presenting many diverse problems
to the drama department, some
of which have never been encoun-
tered before.

One perplexing problem comes
up at the end of the play when
the scenery collapses. This has
to be done every time at rehcai»
sal and each time the whole set
has to be rebuilt. Naturally, the
rebuilding takes much time and
the scenery is hurt some after
each collapse. Thus the stage|
crew must constantly repair the
damaged scenery.

Dying Man.

Another acute problem is the
one that confronts the man who,
dies. It is quite difficult to de-
cide just how a man dies most
effectively. There seem to be
differences of opinion as to
whether a dying man groans and‘l
whether his arm drops. We saw

this in rehearsal and were con-.
vmced that it is much harder tol
die than we previously thought,‘
there can be no slips or the scene
will become definitely humorous,
One can of soup, halt a loaf of
bread, half a package of cigarets,
and one piit of cold tea are cone
surned every night in rehearsals,
for there is eating going on
through most of the play. Ac—
cording to Alfrcd Boylcn, director.
one of his chief worries is to
keep the cast away from the food
table.

so many cigarettes is rather hard
on the actors' throats, but this
is a minor problem.

Lighting Effect.

The sand bags are filled with
saw dust, hay and paper, for it
they had sand this would break
the set completely when it falls
in. At the practice, we visited
the leading man, didn't realize
the set was going to fall in, and
were nearly murdered by the fall-
ing bags and timbcr as it was;
so it would be quite dangerous
to have sand bags.

As the set is the same through-
out the play, the changes in
lighting must be quite effective
There are 19 changes.

the usual ones that go with every

is having its hands full, but all
will be solved by the nights of
March 23 and 25 when “Journey’s
