Preponderance of Controversial
Material in Tanager Explained
by Absence of Student Stories

By JANE LEWIS

A preponderance of controversial
material in the January Tanager is
explained when one notices the ab—
sence of student contributions 'to the
number. Frank o. Lowden, Latitia
Moon Conard, and Sara Sherman
Pryor are the authors of articles
dealing with agriculture, Russia, and
George Pierce Baker. A balance is
maintained by the inclusion of a story
by Esther Holcomb and an essay by
Miriam McNally,

“Conservation in Agriculture" is
the title of cit-Governor Lowden’s
article. This material constitutes the
first part of his presidential address to
the Country Life association;, the
conclusion of his address will appear
in the next issue of the Tanager. Ad-
vocating rural planning along the
line of city zoning, he points out the
technical advisability of immediate
action in conserving limited soil re-
sources.

Holcomb Story Too Tragic

With understanding and precision,
Mrs. Conard writes on “Impressions
of Communist Russia," the material
gathered in her summer's visit to that
country. and presents a lucid explan-
ation of two opposing forces included
in the Soviet psychology, the scien—
tific approach to life, and the devo-
tion to dogma. The communist attl»
tude toward religion is also compre-
hensively explained.

"Amateur Illness" is praised in an
essay by Miriam E. McNally. A var—
iety of imaginative experiences are
set forth here with a sometimes deli—
cate touch. The realism of Miss Mc-
Nally-s detail will be more appreciat-
ed by some readers than will the ver—
isimilitude of Esther Holcomb's story,
“Little Giving." The latter piece of
work, although developed with skill
and sincerity, is almost too tragic for
conviction. One is inclined to di
trust the tourfrequent farm/lite epi—
sode. . ,

Two Lyrics Conventional

An impressionistic account of a well—
known vale professor's career. and a
summary of the “47 Workshop" plan
with its significance for the contem—
porary theater, are set forth in Sara
Sherman Pryor's article on George
Pierce Baker. The material is inter-
esting and significant.

A wood cut by Mary Crook and
three poems complete the body of the
January issue. The two lyrics pro»
ceed from a genuine impulse, but are
somewhat conventional in effect. The
sonnet by Paul Engle is not particul—
arly successful as such, but is sug-
gestive of some poetic insight.

student expression is found in the
hook re‘view section of the issue,
where several recent additions to libs
rary shelves are well discussed,

Big Track Squad
Points for Drake

leonttnued from Para 1)
ncer teams look mediocre.

Grinnell should be as strong as last
year in all events except the pole-
vault. The four lettermen, that were
lost to the squad by graduation, will
he more than replaced by additions
from last year's freshman squad.

Three Quarter-Milers Back

Coach Duke sees the possibilities
of forming a two-mile relay team
new in Grinnell track circles. Duke<
coached mile relays have always been
good, and last year the quartet of Pele
letier, Thomas, H. Edwards, and J.
Edwards forced the relay team from
the University of Iowa to set a rec-
ord to win that event at the state
meet. Three of last year’s quarter-
milers are back for work this season.

Although it is still too early in the
season to predict anything in the way
of the strength of various conference
squads, Drake will, from all indi—
cations, have a team that will be for-
midahle.

A considerable strengthening in the
field events and continued power in
the dashes leaves the Bulldogs only
one department to worry about, and
that is the longer distance events.
Coach Duke of Grinnell believes that
Grinnell‘s biggest worry will come
from the Drake representatives.

Sprinters Look Good

In the dashes Grinnell will have
Alexander and Fojman, men who are
capable of holding their own with
other loop sprinters. Thomas who
was kept out of the quarter-mile
last year in order to strengthen the
points for the scarlet and black teams
