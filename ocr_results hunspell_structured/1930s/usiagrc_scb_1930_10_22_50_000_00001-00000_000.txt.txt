afternoon.

This year’s Maize and Blue outfit
is expected to offer much better res
sistancc to the invaders than did last
year’s eleven, which lost to the Pi
nears, 27 to s. on the Grinnell field.

Two Wins, One Loss

So far this year the Carls have a
'record of two wins and one loss. The
'Huntmeh won their opener from Eau
Claire Normal, scoring 33 points to
none for the Pods. In their next
start the Northfielders swamped
Hamline, a Midwest conference op-
ponent, 59 to 0, on the Pipers home
grounds,

Last Saturday the Maize team met
its Waterloo at the hands of their
traditional rivals, St. Olaf. 19 to a.
when their vaunted attack met its
match in the fleet Viking backs.

ammo. for Each Game

Much of the time this week has
been occupied by Coach Hunt and his
assistants in finding ways and means
of combating the aerial attack of the
Pioneers, which wrought such havoc
to the Carleton hopes last season.
This has not been simple, especially
as Crinnell boasts of a good running
offensive, also. However, the Carls
will be pointed for this game, being-
eager to prove to the returning
alumni that the defeat by the Olcs
was a mistake

The lineup which Coach Hunt will
send against the scarlet and black
cohorts finds in service several new
faces, with a good seasoning of vet-
erans. This yea‘r the Carleton aths
letic department has adopted the pol—
icy of having the coach appoint a
captain for each contest. In the
three games played so far the Maize
team has been led by “Red" Spur—
bcck, star right tackle.

Odds on Grinnell

The supporting cast will consist of
Carson at left tackle, Grannis and
Beck at guards, and Nicholson at
center. Young and Pennock will

as Guests Go

If you are one of those adventurr
ous persons who is always willing to
try something once. you will apprer
ciate the experience of Mary Beck-
man, who did and dared.

She and some of her girl friends
conceived the idea that it would be
no end of fun to hire out as waitress-
es for the summer, a plan n t too
original, but not without possi tics.
It was in spring the venture began,
and after several vain attempts to
land jobs, Mary and another girl
were promised a summer's work.

Everything But Guests

The resort in which they were

hired was a place called Fisherman's

Culinary Employment Drings Halt
to Adventures of Grinnell Student

Paradise, in northern Michigan.
They were to begin work just after
due Fourth of July. Promptly after
the holiday the young enthusiasts
sought their place of employment.

It was a plcasant enough location,
and would have been fairly lucrative
had it not been for the negligible fact
that the guests had departed after
the holiday almost to a man. The
waitrcsscs then, must wait,

Work. g in ‘I’nrud e’

The manager was apologetic.
Would the girls prefer to give up the
job entirely, or would they work in
the kitchen for only a very short
Limeia day or so, until business
boomed a little? In view of the fact
they had been at some expense to
reach the place, Mary and Mack dc-
cided to stay.

One day of kitchen work 7 the
hardest kind of kitchen work, length»
oned into two, three, four days,
There was not enough opportunity to
explore “paradise." A week passed
without promotion from culinary
drugery; a week that seemed no less
than a month for girls unused to
such labor.

39 Guests, 33 Employes?

At length, when they were begin-
ning to think it physically uncndur-
able any longer, the proprietor made
a startling announcement, Upon
counting, he had discovered there
were exactly 39 guests, exactly 33
employes. It was apparent that the
resort was not a paying proposition,
Given the choice of working at half
pay, or quitting, the girls quit.

With some regret, but not unre-
luctantly, they departed for home,
poorer by some $50, but richer by
one week's experience in dishwash-
mg, preparing vegetables, and dis-
covering hitherto unknown facts
about being "on your own.”

Dickinson Tells
Grinnell Voter'sE

of Tariff Work.

Senatorial Candidate Laud:
Policies of Hoover,
Farm Relief

“If you give an economist a pencil
and paper. he will prove almost any-
thing," L. J. Dickinson, republican
candidate for United States senator
from Iowa, warned the Crinncll re-
publican rally in the high school elude
itorium last night. “He will show
how much more the tariff will make
people pay for goods."

“But the beauty of the tariff,”
Dickinson d e clared emphatically,
shaking his head of white hair and
raising his voice, “is that it Works!"

speech Tour of County I

Representative Dickinson spent all
day yesterday in Powcshick county,
speaking briefly in each of the smal—
ler towns and concluding with a talk
to about 300 people in Grinnell. MT.
Dickinson is making support of the
tariff a main issue. Former Govenot,
w. L. Harding was also present to
support Dickinson in his advocacy of,
the Hawley-Smoot tariff./ 1

“Henry Ford and General Motors,
those huge corporations. want to re—
Verse their protective policy." the
speaker asserted, "They say, 'Let
everyone he as big as us, or bc
squeezed out.‘ "

Dickinson Lands Hoover

“The farm tariff has helped the
farmer to the extent of $80,000,000,
already," the senatorial candidate dc-I
clarcd, “Previously it cost Argentin .
farmers nine cents below the freight
rate from Omaha to ship corn to the
Pacific coast." ,

From advocating the tariff, Mr.
Dickinson passed to praising the}
Hoover policies. “President Hoover is
entitled to a republican congress and
to a republican senate,” he said. “I'm'
personally very confident that Iowa
will chose a republican senator at the ‘
next election."

Dan Turner Praised

Dan Turner, republican candidate
for governor of Iowa, came in for
some of the senatorial candidate's
praise. “I know he has a black eye
and a set chin, and that nobody will
run off with the statehousc while he
is governor," said Dickinson.

“There are a lot of reasons for get—
ting out 3. big vote in the off year
elections," according to the candidate.
“Iowa is going to be changed from
11 to 9 representative districts. The!
county or district that sends a demo-
crat to Des Moines won't be in it
when it comes to redistricting the
state."

Supports Uncle Sam's Club

The world fellowshtp and peace
committees, which bring prominent
speakers to Grinnell and con-
duct discussion groups for those in-
terested in international problems:
are sponsored by an appropriation
from the Pioneer chest fund. The
social department, which has charge
of the general reception for faculty
members and college students, and
which gives dinners and teas for the
quadrangle women throughout the
year, derives support in the same
way.

Uncle Sam’s club, the settlement
house for the poorer children of
Grinncll, is made possible by student
contributions, as is the freshman
handbook, published jointly by the
Y.M, and the Y,W.

Students Endorse
Varsity Club for

Dance Economy

The newly formed Varsity dance
club is assured of success, according
to Robert Stevenson, chairman of
the recreation committee, with a
heavy sale of tickets.

Although the goal of 500 members
may not be reached, the membership
will be high enough to allow a bud-
geting of the semester’s expenses
and special rates for members. The
ticket sale started Monday in the
dormitories and in the quadrangle
yesterday.

The plan of the club is to sell
membership tickets at 31, good for
a semester. The holder of one of
these tickets is given entrances to
any varsity dance for not more than
25 cents, and to regular formula for
not more than 50 cents. Students
not holding tickets will be asked to
pay 75 cents to $2 each for the dan-
ces they attend.

Membership tickets are being sold
to both the men and women, and
there will be a number of dances
sponsored by the coeds in order that
they may get the benefit of their pur-
chase. Mcmbcrs of the Varsity club
will be allowed in Friday's dance for
25 cents, while non-members will
pay $2 to hear Fred Hamm's record-
ing orchestra.

The plan was approved by the fac-
ulty and by Lantern this fall.

John Wenger, Frank Bcatle, Theo-
dore Glcystcen, and William Clark
