Tui'or Gridder
Plays One Game:
Named 'AII-S‘I'ar'

Cedar Falls, Ia, Dec. 7—Carroll
Cooli, Iowa state Teachers college
,senror, is wondering where he
Iwould have rated had he not play
Cd the first 20 minutes at the
opening football game against
Grinnell. And it is wrth good
reason, too!

At the end of 20 minutes, Cools,
who had won two football letters
at Teachers college, was injured
and did not play all season But
when the North Central all-coir
fel'ence team was named last
week he was listed as the second
team right tackle.

Cook now figures that he
could have made AllaAmelican if
he hadn't played those first 20-
minutes!

Until Luther’s injury, Peisner
was a possibility to switch to
guard, but now he will probably
have to stick to his forward post.
Feisner is also a possib ity as an
alternate center.

Vern Robinson and David Miller
are reserve forwards, Robinson
apparently favoring a knee in.
jury he received during the foot-
ball season,

George Tompkins, center. may
see service at the pivot position
to take advantage of his size and
ball handling ability.

other reserves include James
Norton, forward, and Richard Ad-
kins, guard.
