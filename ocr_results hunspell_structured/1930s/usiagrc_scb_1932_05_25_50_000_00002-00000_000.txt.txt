ATTENDANCE.
(From the Daily mini)

With optional attendance not yet tested on this
campus, as far as the question of its effect on grades is
concerned, we find that at North Carolina the re-instate-
men of compulsory attendance has had its effect, imag-
ined or not, on grades. .

The Dnily Tar Heel reports that: more than 1,000
students, over one—third of the student body, received
warnings at the end of the first quarter. “Despite the
fact that the recent movements for compulsory attend—
ance at classes were made with the express purpose of
raising the standard of scholarship, word comes from
the registrar’s office to the effect that the number of
students failing to pass their work or who are at the
present time in a dangerous position is the largest that
has been recorded in the past 10 years.”

This view is encouraging, for if it is true that option-
al attendance at classes makes for better grades, then
the end of this semester ought to see a higher general
university average. However. the fact has not yet been
proved here, and everyone must remember that grades
will not be higher simply because more cutting is per»
mitted. Instructors will expect a certain amount of
work. and work of a certain calibre, whether the stu-
dent cuts class often or comes every day.

It would be wellto remember that the proof of op-
tional attendance lies solely in the hands of the student
body. students may make a success of it, or prove it a
rank failure.

INTELLIGENT VOTERS

\Vonlen students at Glinnell, by organizing the
League for l\'olnen Voters, are making a stop for-
u-a tl a long step.

“RAZZING” WRITERS

(From tlic Manitou Messenger)

Not long ago one of Amer a's well-known pen-
wonicn dcclarcd “there is something ridiculous about
a woman who writes." That statement could be re-
worded “there is something ridiculous about a man who
writes" and not lose any of its original meaning.

Through the ages there has been a sort of stigma
attached to those who have made writing their liveli»
hoodl They have been regarded as entirely lacking in
backbone. effeminate, scntimental, and queer. In e'dnr
cational institutions this same view is held. When a
coed turns out a bit of creative work, that is not un-
usual and it is nothing which could not he expected of
a woman, but when a man does this sort of thingi
that's different, and there must be something wrong
with him. This is the opinion of not only students. but
also of many professors.

The career of a writer is not an easy one: probably
not other profession is so full of disappointments and
hardships. A man or woman embarking upon such a
carcer must have as much, if not more. backbone as
one entering any other profession for the rewards are
meager and the chances of success slight. As for being
etfemlnate, is there anything effcminatc in men like
Kipling, Sandburg. and Garland, not to mention the host
of magazine and newspaper writers? Perhaps they may
seem sentimental, but then everyone is that to some
extent, and everyone gives expression to il. one way or
another; authors do so in theirlwriiingsl

People who write are queer and eccentric, but after
all isn't there something queer and eccentric about
everyone? Writers are human: there is not something
ridiculous about them, but there is something ridiculous
about the multitude who debunk and mock them.
