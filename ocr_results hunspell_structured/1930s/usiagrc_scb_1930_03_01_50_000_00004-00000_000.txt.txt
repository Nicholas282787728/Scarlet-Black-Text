Socialism Is Hope
of World—~Thomas

(Continued From l>age 1)

That our present machine age.
with its increasing concentration of
wealth. may wreck civilization un—
less it is brought under control or
the state. was the prediction implied
by Mr. Thomas, in conclusion. He
advocated the gradual increase in the
measurc of socialism by our govern-
ment. that income may he more
evenly distributed and the great so—
cial problems solved

Future Depends
on Education

“The primary motive for obtain—
ing a college education is that it
serves as dn‘open door to material
success,” emphasized M Thomas at
chapel Thursday morning. He in
timated that the modern conception
the road to success was through “pep,
personality and power."

In beginning his talk on the “Uses

of Education" be asked the questio
Why should society stand the ex-
pense of education? Answering it,
he said: “It is because
the future depends on the younger
generation, and a good education is
the best investment that society can
make.
“The possession of a college dip—
loma gives one an hereritary right to
leadership. One can look up to col—
lege men and women tor an apprecia-
tion of problems of the time."

Mr. Thomas asserted that blind
forces and old ideas can never bring
advances nor progress. “Who do we
have to go to," he concluded, “If it
is not the college people?"

Political Parties
Are But Shams

“Because there is no difference in
the issues of the two major political
parties in the Unlted.\States today,
no fundamental economic changes can
come about through the opposition of
these two parties." This is the unsat-
isfactory situation in poli cs

which Mr. Thomas pointed out in his -

talk, “Sham and Reality in American
1>alitics", which he gave in the A, R.
H. auditorium at 11:20.

“The ultimate reality of politics,"
said Mr. Thomas in opening his talk,
"is economiosﬁune distribution of
property. It is economic issues
which determine justice, and
from economic issues that wars
spring.

Coe Debates Here
on Last Thursday

A debate on the subject. “Resolv-
ed: That the nations of the world
should adopt a plan of complete disA
armament except for such forces as
are needed for police purposes" took
place last Thursday night in the A.
R. H. auditorium between Grinnell
and Coe college men, following the
lecture by Norman Thomas.
Richard Sneed, Drennan Miller and
Harley Stipp upheld the affirmative
side of the question for Grinnell,
while Doyle stonehocker, Robert
Duckworth, and Kenneth Clark argu-
ed the negative side for Coe. '
The argument pivoted around the
fact that diarmament was entirely
practicable and could be set in opera-
tion within a reasonable length of
time. The fact that international
communication and trade is so rapid-
ly developing was one of the reasons
given why the nations could reach an
agreement upon disarmament. The
negative maintained that is was not
only impracticable for the nations to
agree upon disarmament but if such

tion of such a party can we get some
action on pressing political affairs.

He spoke of the last presidential
election as a sham with the only is-
sues at stake being the personalities
of the candidates, their religions, and
their Wives. He was critical of the
present administration in its posi-
tion of “rugged individualism" on the
farm question, tariff, and income tax
questions.

,“There is no single issue which
can unite the United states into one
party," he said in answer to a ques-
tion asked in the open forum follow-
ing his tailc "We will have to add
a unifying philosophy and point of
View." He named as possible issues
on which to base a party an increase
in inheritance tax and imperialism.

SATURDAY, MARCH 1. 1930.

 

an agreement was reached that
would not insure world peace.
The Coe men demanded a plan for
world disarmament from Grinnell.
The Grinnell men maintained that it
was unnecessary according to the
statement or the question, pleading
that they were only college men and
that they could not propose in a
short time a plan that statesmen of
the world have labored on so long in
vain. ‘
lticbard Phillips presided and the
debate was a no decision affair.

hoped to take the pole vault. Gri —
nell, however, hopes for some points
in the vault, a few in the hurdles and
stakes the rest on the four distance
runs. The fact that Douglas is in
Tulsa today with the cage squad
somewhat out down Grinnell’s chances
of bringing home the bacon for the
second consecutive time.

three-cornered battle between Gtirh

winner garnering less than forty
points.

I Campus Opinion

Campus Opinion: What do you
think oi the new policy of enforcing
quiet hours in the quadrangle?

Margaret Napier. I firmly believe
that the new regulations are un-
necessarily extreme.

Virginia. Rilliker. I am in favor of
strict observance of quiet hours in
the quad and feel that the student

government organization should be
given complete cooperation in their
attempt to enforce those regulations.

Luella Hall. In my opinion quiet
hours should be euforced~the new
policy is a very good one, but per
hope it is a bit strict.

Camilla Burrows. I think it is an
excellent idea to have moderate
quiet during quiet hours. but do not
believe the rule should he so strictly
enforced that one feels bound by
it.

Arline Colo. It's a good thing. Vic-
trolas and loud talking are disturb-
ing even in upper class cottages and

as long as the rule was made for
the benefit of the girls they should
co-operate.

Elizabeth Mnclvnlian. It makes a
lot of difference when one wants to
study at the quad when there are
quiet hours.

Louine Morris. The policy is 0. K.
except that I don’t like the idea of
late dates having to yodel at you
from outside.

Anuie Nowien. The idea of enforc-
ing quiet hours is all right but the
creating of the necessity of ”zoo”
noises under windows during most of
the evening will not help in making
things quiet.
