HURRIED RULES

When new illstitutions come to Grinncll. new
rules must be made, and ill some cases, it sccllls.
they must be made hurriedly. For instance, ill spite
of all the planning for the reading period, it derelr
oped that the Grillncll string quartet was to pres
sent a recital last night and that a lecture course
number was scheduled for tomorrow evening.

Rules were immediately evolved to provide fol-
the interruptions. Women of the college were ill-
lowcd to attend the recital on condition that 1lley
losc thcir hour’s social privileges from 9 to 10
p. lll. that evening. It so happened that the recital
did not t‘lld until nearly 10 o‘clock, but (llt‘, itlca of
a penalty for attendance at a college evclltipal‘r
ticularly one included on the semester fee program
—is absurd, even though ill this case no actual pell-
alty wzls inflicted.

Now instead of following suit with a similar
ruling ill regard to the lecture course tomorrow
night, it has been decreed that residents of tllc
quadrangle may attend the affair without l‘estlior
tions, Are we to understand, than, that a lecture
is of more value than a recital alld that the per-
centage of semester fee funds which is allotted to
the recital course is out of proportion to the value”

ROOM FOR. BOTH?

There is a rising controversy ill Grillllcll that
questions wllctllcr this school i, sufficientlylargc
for intramural and inter-collegiate sports pros
grams.

Summing- up the present situation we find
freshman candidates for football, basketball, track,
and swimming. are barred from palticipatioll ill
intramural sport Yet these freshman athletes are
receiving inadequate coaching in the fundamentals
of the two spol- , football and basketball. Time
spent at practices is worse than wasted for them.

When freshmen lose interest ill atllletic.‘ hero
because of inadequate coaching, the intramural
program cannot be condemned for their lack of ill-
tercst even though the freshmen profess a desire to
participate ill the intramural sports. Give all the
freshmen aspirants for participation ill iutcrecole
lcgiate atlllet s honest, sincere, and impartial LII»
toring and there \lill be no crisis ill Grillllcll ath-
letics as exists today.

It is evident that the athletic deportlllcut must
he constantly on the alert, and must cxcrt every
effort possible to arouse the student’s illtorcst ill
varsity sports. It certainly does not belittle the
dignity of any coach to address the men of the
school and talk with them personally, urging them
to come out for athlotics. If this fails to interest
a man, he can turn then to intramural sports. In
this way the intralllural sports program can bc
llladc supplcmclltary to the va lty program, and
every interested mall prefer, it that way.

With every hall anxious to be represented ill
the Honor G club, and with luauy students person-
ally desiring to possess all Hollor G sweater, val»
sity athletics are ill a position to profit materially.
But it is now up to the coaches, through pcrsollal
contact work, impartiality alld illtcrcst ill all stllr
dents cnrollcd ill varsity and freshman atlllcli
to assure this material gain alld make tllc best of
thc opportuni It i evident from the disparag-
ing criticism that ill 't students are still interests
cd in producing a winning tcalrl in G llncll, but
it would be a mistake to antagonize students I
attempting to suppress intramural sports by clillll
natillg competition for trophies.

There is a final obligation tllat the coaches owe
to the student himself, the hall, and the intramural
program. When the coach is convinced that a mall
is not of varsity caliber, that man should be
dropped from the squad after a personal interview
with the coach. thn the coach malics this do-
cision, he should inform the mall, and not carry
him along through the season and the years as has
happened ill Grinncll before.

There is room for both sports programs, alld
though the intramural schedule is supplementary
to the varsity program there will be adequate ma—

NE‘V GERBIAN KULTUR
(The Gilmorehill Globe)
(Glasgow University, Scotland)

In Germany today the universities are a supreme
expression of nationality, Students now regard them—
selves as having been the pioneers of the Nazi revolu-
tion. This does DOL mean that there are not many unr
dergraduates who, as Socialists or Communists, are pro-
foundly opposed to the present regime . In universities,
In factories, and even in the ranks of the S.A. and 8.5.
the Communists, as well as all thuse who in general
stand for liberal ideas, are becoming better organized
every day, But they are inartioulate and are likely to
remain so. The strident body is, for the most part, her
hind Hitler.

When Oxford undergraduates argued (as they did
at Ettal) in favor of freedom of Speech and the right
to criticize, as exemplified in the recent union debate
on fighting for king and country, the German Students
retorted: “We are in the middle of a. revolution, and the
Sooner you realize this fact the sooner you will under.
stand many things which are happening- in Germany
today . . . . it

"Of civilization,” Said the head of the Deutsche
Studentcnchaft, "with its motor cars and wireless and
other material advantages, we have had cncugh‘, we
must gel: back to Goethe and the old spiritual culture
of the German people." This distinction between civili-
zation and culture is constantly referred to, The large
towns it is maintained, have produced civilization, not
culture, and therefore, a backeto-thErland policy is a
cardinal feature of the National-Socialist program.

These opinions are expressed with astonishing naie
veil? and enthusiasm. But the Nazi Students are noth-
ing if not deadly serious. They lack all sense of humor
and shut their eyes to What they do not Wish to see.

On the question of war guilt they have been taught
to believe that Germany is entirely innocent and refuse
to see that this myth is as absurd and dangerous as
that of fixing all responsibility for the war on Germany.
An honest attempt to understand the mentality of the
German student of today leads to great perplexity. On
the one hand is genuine sympathy for the efforts now
being made by tens of thousands of young Germans to
win back for their cuuntry after 15 years of humiliation
a place in the sun. On the other hand one stands amazed
and disgusted at the ruthless suppression of individual
freedom and the naive simplicity which believes that at
new nation can be built up on the fear of the Concentra-
tion camp and the axe.

FOOTBALL: FIGHT 0R FROLIC‘?
(Butler Collegian)

Heywood Broun, in a, recent al‘LICle in The Indian-
apolis Times carefully dragged the problem of college
football over the coals and with several critical obser-
vations brought out some rather striking points. He
pointed out that because of Yale's bad season this year
many of the old grads are losing their proverb-
ial spirit. ,

After two Yale players laughed when a Harvard man
ran for a touchdown, Yale alumni severely criticized
them by roaring that the undergraduates were soft
and sybaritic. Mr. Broun says that this brings up the
question of really whether or not college football is
fight 01' frolic. He Says “it is considered grave hercr
sy for any rangy tackle to admit that he had fun dur-
mg the game. He is not ollt there to enjoy himself.
His duty is to do or die.”

He answers those who claim that growing casual—
neSS in colleges of today is due to bridge and parlor
tricks with the idea that modern youths have a. change
of perspective. They concern themselves with formu-
lation of liberal clubs, study groups, and the state of
the world outside the campus.

Mr, Bl'oun Says, "For instance, the abolition of War
is a far more vital concern than the fate of the foot-
ball mam. In 1911] even those of us who were merely
spectators spent two months discussing what the
team would do and after the big game an add ions!
four months in talking about how and why it failed to
do it.

“Now obviously there isn't any sense in that. I have
heard that the harsh and arduous grind of football
makes for the development of character, but even after
a man has developed character it is of some impel-tr
81100 that he Should know what to do with it. Person-
ally, 1 would not be at all in favor of developing char-
acter merely to come out in the world and be a
staunch, standpat Republican.”

Heywood Broun concludes his article as follows:

”Let every college in the country aim at nothing
more than a pretty good coach and a pretty good team
and a fair number of victories. What would be fair—
er?

Editor. The Scarlet and Black,
Dear Sir:

The activities which unfortunately

have been scheduled to take

place

during the reading period bring up
the general question of the arranger

ment or the college calendar.

It

seems to me that there are conflicts

arising frequently which call f
changes that would be unnecessary,

or
if

the requirements of classes and ac-

tivities were more carefully consi
cred.

d-

For a number of years it has been
the custom to present a Homecom-

ing play. The production necessari
involves the time and energy of
substantial group of students. ,
longer preparation is required 1

1y
a

or

this, the first play of the year, than

for any other because of breaking

stage equipment. What
more discouraging than to have mi
semester examinations the
weekl

in

and organizing the
could be

d.

same

0i: two of the three nights of the
reading period are scheduled a l‘ecit»

al and a, lecture which Seem to def
the purpose of the

v

reading period.

Many of the students desire to at»
tend these, but feel that giving 'up
that much Study time will be detri-

mental to their exams.
I realize that there are things th
come up causing unavoidable conill

but it Seems that a more careful and

considerate planning in the

begin-

ning might do much to make a bet;

ter balanced student program.
