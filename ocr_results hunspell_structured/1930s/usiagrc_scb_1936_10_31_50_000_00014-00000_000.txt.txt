of the four defeats, the team
has shown a definite improve-
ment in each game, and lost their
last tilt, against Washburn. on
untimely fumbles and intercepted
passes.

Powerful Running Attack

On the other hand, the Pio-
neers will be up against one of
the most powerful running at-
tacks in the state. Drake, with
a backfield composed of two
heavy blocking backs and two
light, fleet running backs. func-
tioning behind a bruising line and
almost perfect blocking, has
stea'm»rollered all opposition this
year, with the single exception of
Creighton. who defeated the Bull-
dogs by a 13-6 margin, mostly be
cause of a strong passing attack.
Di'akeIs main weakness lies in her
pass defense, which has allowed
every team they have met this
year to score once or more.

It is impossible to speculate
about the outcome of a Drake-
Grinnell game, because the in-
tense rivalry sweeps all other
considerations before it. Both
schools point for this game, and
the boys on both teams put more

into it than in any other contest.

It is, however, safe to say that

the game will be an exhibition of

pass offense by both teams.
Fair Passing Attack

The Pioneers have a fairly good
passing attack to throw against
the weak Bulldog air defense,
while Drake in the last few gam-
es have shown that they too can
chuck passes, and Grinnell has so
far this season been particularly
It is al-
most certam that both teams will
score freely.

As far as physical condition is
concerned, the Pioneers will have
the edge. All the regulars slated
to start will he in shape to go
at game time. Preston Evans'
'hand is recovered sufficiently to
allow him to play, and Dick
Moore will probably have recov-
ered from his injured back en-
ough to start.

Barker Definitely 0m:

Grinnell’s main physical weak-
ness will be in the condition of
the reserves, especially in the
backfield. Barker, fullback who
ltwisted his knee in practice this
week, is definitely out, as is Har-
ry Livermore, with a similar in-
jury.

The Bulldogs are not so well
off, with ‘Orebaugh still ailing to
some extent, Underwood and Su-

 

 

ter in none too good shape, Phil
Mahders, star blocking back, and
Fulton, outstanding line blocker,
uncertain starters. Their loss
will weaken Drake consider-ably,
inasmuch as Drake has few caphr
ble reserves.

Grinnell, too, will be playing
with a pyechological advantage
caused by an increase in spirit

on the campus unequalled for a '

number of years. The facts that
the game is the Homecoming
contest, that it is being played
on the Pioneers own field, and

that Gnnneu wants revenge will

have no small bearing on the out-
come.
