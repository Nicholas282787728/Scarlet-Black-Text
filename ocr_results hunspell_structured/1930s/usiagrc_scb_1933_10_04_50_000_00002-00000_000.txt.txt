STUDENTS VOTE FOR PRUDITIES

The, Pioneer Pruditics have been formally ap-
proved by the students of Griuncll. The next stcp
is to draw .up a workable plan for the production,
so that problems of mismanagement, over-work,
and unsuitable material will not be evident.

Particularly promising were the returns on at
tendance of the production. Even those students
who were not anxious to have the rcvuc rcvivcd
and who did not express interest in aiding in the
production, still declared themselves interested ill
viewing the finished product. Tllc problem of at-
tendnuce for the Prnditics will seemingly be all
cosy one to solve.

A workable plan for the production, we be
lieve, as drawn up by the dramatic council, should
involve for one thing, the appointment of a Come
mittcc to write the entire revue, instead of depend-
ing upon “free—lance” authors ill the various
buildingsia very impractical plan as was evi-
denced two years ago. ‘

The Grinnell chapter of Sigma Delta Clli is
in charge of financial and promotional features of
thc revue, and the Grinncll chapter of National
Collegiate Players in charge of production. This
would necessalily mean that both must confer as
to their respective duties so that there will be no
duplications and no complications.

The students want the Pioneer Pruditics, Let
them have them ill a revised, up-to-date production
ill which evcl'yonc‘s job is wcllrdcfincd and in
which no one person bears an unnecessarily large
burden on his shoulders.

THE HALL LIBRARIES

Shortly before school dismissed last Spring
a system of individual hall libraries was installed
in tile men’s dormitories. At that time, a room was
sell aside in each hall and a small collection of
books placed in each, the rooms being locked ex
cept for certain hours during the day.

The libraries were not a great success. Perhaps
it was because the hours during which a student
could borrow a book were so limited; perhaps be
cause it was so late in the spring that studies (and
other activities) left little time for browsing
through such books. At any rate the scheme was
not as successful as its originators had hoped it
would be, .

Undaunted by this slow beginning of one of
its projects, the Council of House Presidents is
planning to again undcltakc the establishment of
the hall libraries We belicvc that the scheme is
worthwhile, and if given a fair chance should prove
a boon to the men in the dormitor 5.

‘Miss Isabelle Clark, head librarian, cxpersscd
the wish that the libraries could bc left open all
day instead of at certain intervals. Such a plan
would certainly make them more popular and his
crease their usefulness. But whatever the final ar-
rangements by thc Council of House Presidents,
the basic idea of the separate libraries is an im»
provemellt in the dormitories.

INDIVIDUALISM

While we are prancing witll unholy joy at the
funeral of individualism, let us not forget that it
has becll individualists who have given to the
world the best and highest which we esteem.

Look at Jeremiah, Socrates, Christ, Galileo,
Spinoza, and Marx, to mention but a few of the
hundreds who have been the vanguard of world
culture. These men were illdividualists to the core.
daring to doubt the smug dogmas of their day,
and willing to suffer. for the privilege of express-
ing themselves, the slings and allows of outraged

, and provide for the llappille

followrlncu, What if those mini, and other rebcls
against tradition, had never voiced their protest?
Would there have bccll such a thing as progress?

The iflelil of the Amer u people has bccu,
and still 3 freedom of expression. Even if we are
hrai-(ily In tvor ol’ the New Deal, that docs not
inc-all that we would like to son the squclcliing of
individual initiative. Our ideal is to nchicvc ccon-
omic security for all, so that man, able to provide
for himself the necessities of life at all times, may
be able to lfully express himself ill other lines of
endeavor. Oil ill that way could society progress,
of it members.

It is not, therefore, iudnidu lsln which we
are so anxious to eliminate, as it Is economic Mir
lll’t’lllsnl, thc unrestrained liberty to c lloit human
beings and the bounty of nature fol Ifish cnds.

TRADITION

With the entrance of each new freshman class
routes the l‘cawzlkcuing of old Gl'illllcll traditions.
The sources of many of these traditious are too
rcmolc for adequate explanation by proscutrday
uppcl-chissmcn. But there is tllc tradition of no
smoking on the noun campus cvolviug from the
heaps of rigorctl butts about the cutraurcs to
Alumni Recitation hull. This unsightly menace was
removed by the Ila-smoking tradition and it has
been the duty of the Honor G club to insure, ell-
l‘orccmellt of it.

To all freshmen and new students, may this
editorial serve to remind you that any lion G
man is clltpowcl‘ed with the author' y to prohibit
your smoking on the main campus and a polite
compliance with the rcquests of those men will
serve to put you ill good stead with that organiza-

tioll.

THE STUDENT AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

This depression has been a great chastiscincnt
to the American ‘tudent. It has rudely awakened
him to the realization that hc is a port of a soc' ll
whole, and that when society suffcrs, hc suffcl

Besides financially cmbarassing many stue
dents, and preventing others from returning to
school, this pcriod of economic stress has stimulat-
ed the student to think of his education and his
plaCe ill the world in a different light from which
he has been accustomed. The orthodox conception
of higher education has been purely individualistic
ill nature. College was looked llpoll as; a placc
where one could gct a head start on the other fcl-
low ill the struggle for existence; or, as the “prop-
er” place to go after finishing high school; or, as
a place for absorbing “culture,” so that one could
speak nollcllalalltly of literature and art, and talk
glibly ill French

This idea of a college education is rapidly
yielding to the conception of higher education as
the basis for fitting men and women to play a pos-
itive role in their commmunity. It is not enough
for college graduates to enter business or the pro-
fessions in order to make themselves economically
secure. They have a definite responsibility to socie-
ty, and should use their privileged education in (lo-
ing their part in social construction and human
betterment.

EXILES

(Intel-collegiate Press)

At least 18 of the many liberalrminded German
university professors exiled by the Hitler government
are to teach this year in the United States.

Three of themiProf. Otto Stern, experimental
physicist; Prof. I. Estermann, his assistant,‘ and Prof.
Ernst Berl, chemistiare to join the faculty of the
Carnegie Institute of Technology at Pittsburgh, where
they will divide their time between teaching and re-
search.

Fifteen others, five of whose names are still with—
held to allow them to wind up their affairs in Germany
with as little trouble as possible, will become members
of the faculty of the University in Exile of the New
School of Social Research, to be opened Oct. 1 at
Princeton, N. J.

The New School of Social Research, planned to
open this year by Dr, Alvin Johnson as an experiment
in higher education without athletics and other extra-
curricular activities, last year had signed up Dr. Albert
Einstein, famed German scientist, as its first and out-
standing faculty member.

The new institutions University in Exile was
planned this summer when it became evident that a
large number of distinguished German educators “fur-
laughed” by Hitler would be available and could be
bonded together in one of the most distinguished facul-
ties e scholarly student could hope to study under.

Here are 10 of the 15 who will make up this faculty:
Prof. Max Wertheimer, experimental psychology, logic
and philosophy; E. Von Homboste, musicology, psye
chology and ethnology; his Sun, J. Homboste, physics;
Frieda Wunderlicb, economics and sociology; Karl
Brandt, agricultural economics; Emil Lederer, labor and
social problems; Gerhard Colm, public finance; Arthur
Feiler, international politics; Hermann Knntorowicz,
jurisprudence, and Eduard Helmsnn, economics.

Dr. Johnson asserted that "the University in Exile
is not a charitable venture," inasmuch as all of the 15
could have obtained positions elsewhere, nearly every
one having offers of chairs in universities outside
Germany.

- NOTES.

Monday

“A no for its own sake is the only
lie without reproach," declared Roy
H. Pairing, professor of German, at
Tuesday morning chapel.

On the other hand, Professor Perr-
ing sees the use of superlative as one
of the worst types of the universal
practice of lying.

“You are fortunate to be here, be-
cause this year is the most signifir
cant in the history of the country
and college,” John P. Ryan, professor
of speech, told the students Tuesday
morning.

“In the determined effort to meet
the changing condi 'ons of the world
about, we are uniting to maintain
the ideal of the college,"

Between the theories of learning,
recapitulotion and experiment, Stu»
dents must keep the pendulum of
education swinging in order to find
the highest standard of living and
learning, Mr, Ryan concluded.
