WELCOME, FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT

Tomorrow night the first lecturer of the
school year will make his appearance on the
campus. He is Frank Lloyd Wright, one of
the foremost architects of our day, the cre—
ator of an original style in building design.
Mr, Wright’s most famous achievement is
the Imperal hotel in Tokio, Japan, This
building was floated on an underground
sea of mud, instead of being anchored down
firmly in the conventional manner. The
soundness of this plan was demonstrated to
the Whole world when the earthquake of
1923 left the Imperial hotel the only un-
damaged building in downtown Tokio.

Here in Grinnell we have two buildings
which were designed by one of Mr. Wright’s
pupils. One of them is the York home, di»
rectly across the street from Dr, Leo Prent-
isss Sherman’s home, The other, the Powee
shiek County National Bank building, is lo-
cated in downtown Grinnell. Look them
over to get an idea of the Wright style,

It is seldom that an American artist in
any field develops an original treatment of
his art, American art, if such a thing
exists at all, is usually copied from the art
of Europe. It is a rare treat to be able to
hear a man who has blazed a new trail in
architecture, The student body of this col—
lege owes a great deal to Frederick L. Bau-
mann and to the lecture course committee
for bringing this man to us. We are sure
that Mr, Wright will be well received to-
marrow at 7:30 11ml in Her ick chapel.
The lecture course series has a fine start.
May the rest of the lecturers measure up
to what we expect of the first.

C—

THE PIONEER CHORUS

The Pioneer chorus is Grinnell’s organiza-
tion for surplus Vocalists. The glee clubs
obviously cannot be made large cllough to
include all the students who enjoy singing
in groups, but the Pioneer chorus can!

night, the women outnumbered the men at
least fiv to one. That fact alone should be
attractive to many of you men, but there
are even more attractive features. You do
not have to take any entrance examina»
tiolls. There are no uncomfortable tryouts
with scales and solos to sing. You just
slip into the back rows and sit with the
tenors or the basses, whichever you please.
No questions are asked.

Secondly, and this feature should be
equally inviting to both men and women,
some of the members of the chorus will be
chosen to sing the “Messiah” with the coin-
bined glee clubs this winter. it will be a
privilege and a pleasure for those who are
fortunate enough to be selected 1.0 sing in
this amassmcnt of voices. Anyone who has
joined the Pioneer chorus will be eligible.

Singing with the glcc clubs, however, is
just a side issue of the Pioneer chorus its
principal function is to provide a weekly
assemblage of people who enjoy creating
their own music. Under the directorship of
F. Walter Huffman, the singing is not dis-
connected or mechanical as one might ex-
pect of such a group, but rather becomes
united and expressive.

Men, here is your chance to get in and
sing. Remember, no qualifications, lots of
fun, and a chance at the “Messiah," Let’s
be at the chapel full force tonight at 8:30
p.nil

wmu CHEER ioTGlMEu

As evidenced by the last football game,
there is a real need on the campus for an
organized cheering section at athletic con»
tests, The campus pep committee has oi-
galiized a group of cheer leaders for the
game with Central Friday night, but it is
not stopping there, With the Honor ”G”
club cooperating, the pep committee is try-
ing to organize a rooting section for the
Friday night game.

We have several suggestions to offer in
regard to this idea, The following practices
have been followed at other colleges and
there is no reason why we cannot use them
here and revive a waning school spirit:

1. The honor ”G” club should cooperate
with the pep committee and see to it
that freshmen wearing their prep hats
sit in a body in the stands.

2, This section should be marked for
all those who want to get in there and
yell! We need an organized cheering
section.

3. The students should, as is done in
many schools, stand in their places aft-
er the game is over and sing, "Sons of
Old Grinnell" as the band plays the
school song.

This last could be made a freshman re—
quirement in order to form a nucleus which
would add as an incentive for the rest of
the student body to join in,

These few suggestions do not preselit_the
difficult problems of arrangement, seating,
etc. They could be easily enforced and fol-
lowed, and they would add a great deal to

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

Lester Shepard, 1851mm“! tackle,
has a “pen pal.” We quote direct»
ly from a manuscript received by
Smiling Lcster only as of yesters
clay: “I hope that you will not
think me forward in writing this
letter, but after seeing your stell-
ar performance against our boys
(Iowa State Teachers] I could not
rcfrain from writing you." Inti»
mating that further relations
would be welcome, Lester’s coin
respondent went on to say that
she, too, was the athletic type.

Lester’s roommate, “Stinky"
Moehl, also has a "pen pal."
Moehl's correspondent, in con-

trast, is the confining mother of
a girl who didn’t go to Grinncll,
The reason, says this matron, lies
in the fact that the Grinnell bays
luck romance.

(Ed's note: Maybe it’s the cold
climate.)

Our scouts also report that the
Misses Woodward and Hale, even
as “Stinky" and Smiling Lester.
have been the rccipiants of
lengthy epistlcs on the social
piohlem,

Well, social problem or not, we
still don't think that the Grinnell
cured aggresses via mail.

As we reminded our host of read—
crs last week, we are only stu-
dents and hence, do not drink.
But in a loutine call to the home
of that “off the campus exclu~
Slveness,” we did greatly enjoy

ed popularity of his favorite

Those in the know claim that it
was no more “chance” accident
that brought. the arm injuries to
young Carson and Brain. Our
much quoted and reliable man
Friday states positively that two
college students were routed out
of a pear tree near the campus
by the owner thereof and suffer-
ed injuries when they fell to the

Are You} Too, a ‘Pet Peeve? ’
If'Not, You’re a Rare Bird

Profs. Are Wise
To Slickers Who
Sleep and Bluff

By John Marion

Believe it or liotithesc profs of
ours are humall' This is proved
hy the facts in the ensuing story.
They all have likes and dislikes
for Lin: valious types of students.

One of the most common types
of peevos is that of the student
who thinks he knows all This is
the person who raises his hand on
every question and recites in an
arrogant [one :

Another of the same sort is
the student who tries to monopos
lize all the time by asking ques
tion after question, most of which
are poor questions.

A person thaL makes many of
the piofs see red and want to
commit murder is the one who
chews gum incessantly.

Then there is the “bluff,” known
to all mcmhers of the faculty, who
tries to he cagey: he waits until
someone else has been called upon
to mac and then quickly raises
his hand. With a hurt look on
his face, he acts as though he
really wanted to be called upon.
People who do this constantly
make profs cases for psycopathic
wards,

Most of the pcdagogues are ope
posed to sleeping in classes, so
don’t think you're getting away

This is the wound in

 

with it. There is often a special
column in the grade book foi-
sleepers, who aren't as clever as
they think, Don't you know that
all the profs were students once?
They, loo, tried to duck hchind
Lhc person in front of Lhem and
catch a few winks,

Then there are two types of
“pay no attentioners,” those who
JUSL don't pay attcnt n, and those
who don't pay attention and who
annoy oLhcrs at the same time.
The first. group is ignored for they
only hotlicl' themselves, but the
second group is hated with the
smouldering type of hate that
grows and grows over the years.

ci-ihbcrs ale disliked, hut they,
too, only hurt themselves, and a —
though punished when caught,
thcy are not considered too much.
The honor system s supposed to
attend to them.

So all in all the profs are n
bunch of “good Joes"; they are
human. and many of them were
once the “pet peeves" of their
profs.

Pioneer Chorus Rehearses

victor Herbert songs for the
Pioneer chorus have arrived and

Openings for those who are in—

special need for tenors is felt,
