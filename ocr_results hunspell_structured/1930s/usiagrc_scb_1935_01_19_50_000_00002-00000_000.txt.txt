READING PERIOD

The reading period, in its third year oi life
and still considered an experiment, might gener—
ally be considered as a successful undertaking.
The idea, to begin with, was originated for the
purpose of giving time for concentrated study and
review, without interruptions of classes and out-
side activities, but, as a new reading period comes,
the cooperation of the students and faculty is
needed to make the study period more than a
waste of time.

Last year the rules stated that all assignments
were due before the reading period began, that
there would be no upper class recitation or class
periods, and freshmen classes would be at the
discretion of the instructor in charge. Viola-
tions were cited by critics last year, who men-
tioned certain instructors who assigned reports
and papers to be worked on during the study
period This obviously defeated the purpose of
the period, and spelled the need of faculty co-
operation. '

This year, as before, all assignments, reports,
and papers are due before the period begins,
upperclassmen will have no classes to disrupt
their study and freshmen classes, if held at all.
will be only for the purpose of re'view, And
so, the cooperation of the faculty is practically
assured.

The students, however, Without proper co-
operation, can make the reading period a failure,
Of the greatest importance iS Strict obeyal’lce to
the social rules made by the committees from the
League board, the Council of House Presidents
and the deans. Infractions of these rules, be—
sides being to one’s own disadvantage, is a charge
against the reading period itself.

Success of the period this year will undoubt-
edly establish it as a permanent institution, so
this mutual cooperation is imperative.

ITS YOUR. LOSS

At Thursday night’s recital, the student at-
tendance was disappointingly small, considering
the expense incurred and the high quality of en—
tertainment offered.

One cannot but wonder why anyone should
deliberately deprive himself of the pleasure of
attending such an outstanding event as this recital
was. Too much work to do? This might be a
.alid excuse in a few Cases—but very few. Not
interested in the type of entertainment offered?
That is the excuse of ignorance, for one purpose
of college attendance is to develop a taste for good
music and to gain a general cultural background.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Both the music department and the lecture
course committee have done their utmost to en—
gage the finest attractions possible and have just
cause to be proud of the programs they have ar-
ranged. Tlle artists’ recitals in particular
deserve better attenclance~and would get it if
the students appreciated what they are missing.

G
WORRIED FRATERNITIES

Being, as it is, one Of the few schools in the
country to completely abandon any form of social
fraternity, Grimlell looks with interest upon the
apparent decline in the popularity of fraternities
on other campuses. While the trend away from
this sort Of organization has been noticeable for
some time in the east, it is only recently that it
has become perceptible in this section of the
country.

Minnesota university, however, reports this
fall that the number of fraternity initiates drop-
ped 33 per Cent below that of last year. In fact,
it was stated that the rushing this week will
likely decidc whether or not several of the tra-
ternities will remain active, and that possibly
three houses will withdraw if they continue with—
out success.

While the blame for the decrease in pledges
was placed by some on a recent increase of three
dollars in the rushing fee, many feel that this
could not possibly be sufficient cause for the
grea change in attitude at Minnesota. The frae
tern es have long involved exorbitant expense
Though the cliquishness which the fraternity
created on most campuses was never considered
justification for dropping the system, the un~
necessary expenses associated with fraternity ri—
valry~plus the depression—seem at last to be
forcing a recognition of the fraternity’s inherent
disadvantages.

Other Opinions

MICROBES AND MEN
(Minnesota Daily)

One of those science magazines, with a picture of
a big bug on its cover, recently published a rather lurid
article, embellished with opium.dreamer pictures, about
microbes, Now the microbe, to most people, while
far from insignificant, especially when eulogized by peo.
ple like Sinclair Lewis, in books like "Arrowsmith,” or
by Dr. deKruif in the “Microbe Hunters." is at least
so small as to be unworthy of, say. one’s everyday
thoughts. There are so many things in life, that a
microbe cannot honestly expect to receive much attention.

Thus it came as a sudden surprise, almost a shock,
to learn, from this buggilyullustrated but nonetheless
informative article, that some microbes are 5,000 times
as large as others. If one is at all a philosopher. or if

Duetschland, in the manner of a lumbering elephant try.

THE PROF SPEAKS
(Daily Northwestern)

From the Montgomery Adviser and the Crimson.
White of the University of Alabama comes information
that the Northwestern faculty has compiled a list of
habits which make students unpopular with professors.

with grades coming out in a few weeks, this seems
like a particularly timely item to mention.

The list follows:

1 Wearing an old high.schoo1 sweater, a soiled shirt
and no necktie.

2, Entering an office with a hat on, sitting on the
professor's desk, and lighting a cigarette.

3. Feeling that he is misunderstood and persecuted.

4. Finishing an examination last, especially when the
rest of the class has finished an hour before.

5, Monopolizing a conference hour.

6. Insisting on practicing new dance steps on a crowd.
ed floor.

7. Excusing poor work because of
before. '

it has been suggested that the list be posted on every
mirror so that it might be read often, but that would
do no good. The ones to whom this is addressed would
be guilty of a worse error than any listed above—not
knowing when to take a gentle hint,

CHAPEL
NOTES

Raymond B, McClenon, professor of
mathematics, who was in charge of
chapel this week, spoke on the general
topic, “Liberal Educauon," the purpose
of which, he explained Monday, is
to make one free from ignorance, pre.
judice, and provincialism,

In Tuesday's talk, Professor MC.
Clcnon discussed the purpose of
science, stating that its object was to
obtain general principles from a num.
ber of facts. and to seek the truth by
a dispassionate, disinterested study of
a situation. He expressed the opinion
that the present minimum college re.
quircments in science are not enough
to justify application of the term “lib.
eral education.”

Wednesday morning, the speaker
treated the idealistic clement in
science and the artistic side of vari.
ous scientific studies. He pointed out
that the truly scientific spirit has an
artistic side in that it seeks for Sym.
metry, beauty, and order, Each type
of art involving many laws to be ob.
served is thus. in part. a science, Mr.
McClenon said his conception 01 a
free and liberal spirit is one which
has much feeling for both the fields
of art and of scienckart including,
of course, music, painting, soulpturing,
and similar studies.

Professor McClenon completed his
series of chapel speeches Thursday
with a consideration of the value to
be received by studying the social
sciences. “On every hand," he said,
"there are many evidences that our
present world is exceedingly inter.
dependent, A free human spirit a
needed to cope with such problems
as corrupt politics, race prejudice, and
war." He stressed that a most im.
pomnt asset in achieving the desir.
able attitude is the study of foreign
languages and obtaining a new point
on other lands and races by reading
their literature.

“You have the power," Professor
McClenon asserted in conclusion, “to
make life interesting and rich for
yourself, and valuable to others—ville
aim of a liberal education.”

America Has Full-Grown
Drama of Own, Says Clark

"America has a more or lass lull.
grown drama of its own,” Barrett Clark,
writer and critic who has been engag.
ed to speak at an informal gathering
here Feb. is, declared in a letter to
Mls. Sara Sherman Pryor, dramatic
director. '

Mr. Clark has chosen “New Frontiers
of American Drama” for his subject,
He declares, "I find it nearly imposs.
ible to speak on any other Subject, be.
cause of my absorbing interest in the
present and future of our own drama,"

In order that American drama shall
become a’definite part of life through.
out the country, Mr. Clark maintains
lhat production must be decentralized
so that every part of the country shall
have a growing theatre of iLs own. in
his talk he will emphasize this need
and suggest ways and means for its
spread.

Especially interested in the young
men who are making contemporary
drama, Mr. Clark was among the first
to recognize and write extensively of
the talent of Eigene O’Neill, Paul
Green, and many other young writers.

Alumnus Recalls
Players" Refusal
to ‘Tap’ Cooper

Although in 1923 he was president
of the Crinnell college dramatic club
when it refused membership to Gary
Cooper, Homer N. Abegglen of A1.
bio, assistant professor of speech a:
Miami university at Oxford, ohio, is
today one of the screen star's most
enthusiastic fans.

The Ohio professor recently paid
a visit to the home of his parents,
Mr. and Mrs. John F. Abegglen, in
Albia.

Abegglen and Harry G. Bames. a
Crinnell boy who graduated from
high school and college here and
who is now professor of speech at
the University of Iowa, headed the
20 members of the Grinnell dramatic
club which 11 years ago "black.
bailed” Gary Cooper for "lack of
dramatic possibilities." Mrs. Hallie
Flannagan, theatre director at Vassar
college, was then advisor of the group,

“Cowboy" ,Frank J. Cooper, the
Cary of today, whose home was in
Helena, Mont, tried out for the club
as a freshman student. He was
required to give a short cutting from
a play before the entire college club
membership.

With a note of apology for the
judgment of the club Abegglen laugh.
ed over the recollection of the incident.

“Gary was only a freshman, tall
and lanky, and we seniors naturally
thought probably he'd have another
Chance to make a better performance
and get into the club later," he said,

But Gary Cooper never became
an active member during his two
years as a Grinncll student. In 1331
he was tendered and accepted at his
home In Hollywood an honorary mem—
bership in the Grinnell chapter of Na.
tional Collegiate Players. successor to
the old dramatic groupeorinnell Re.
