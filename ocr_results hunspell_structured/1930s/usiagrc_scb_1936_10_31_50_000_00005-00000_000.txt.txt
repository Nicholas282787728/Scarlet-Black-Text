Drake, Grinnell Rivalry
Extends Over 42 Year Period

I

When Drake and Grinnell meet
this afternoon in the Pioneers‘
annual Homecoming game, it will
be the fortyrsecond meeting be-
tween the two schools since the se-
ries started in 1896. Only one year
has been missed in the rivalry,
the lapse occurring in 1899, when
Grinnell and the state University
of Iowa at Iowa City charged
Holland of Drake with profession-
alism. Ineensed at the charges,
the Des Moines school cancelled
two games with Grlrlnell and one
with Iowa that year.

Drake holds a deiinite edge in
the series, having won 26 or the
games to the Piurteel's' 14.

strangely enough, omy two games

lock occurring in 1920, when the
two schools scored seven points
apiece, and the other coming in
1929, when the game ended in a

up by either team came in Grin-
nell's 71-0 victory in 1918, rul-
lowed by Drake’s 6770 victory in
1904. .

The last Pioneer victory was
scored in 1932, when the Grinnell
team staged a desperate last-quar-
