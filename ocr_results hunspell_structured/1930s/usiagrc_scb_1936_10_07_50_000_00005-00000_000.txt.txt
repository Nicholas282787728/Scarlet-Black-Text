Women Writers

Says Reporters

Los Angeles, Cal,7(ACPl7
“Women do not make bum news»
papermen,"
in the Junior Collegian of Los
Angeles Junior college.

“Thoroughly disproving the old
adage employed in the newspaper
profession is the long and impos»
ing list of famed women journal-
ists Including such stellar writing
figures as Dorothy Dix, Elsie Rob-
inson, Fay King, Eleanor Barnes,
and Nell Brinkley.

“Dorothy Dix, (Mrs Elizabeth
Meriwether Gilmer in private life)
now as, is the most important
newspaper confidante in the world.
Serving as the helpful counselor to
approximately 13,000,000 readers.
Miss Dix's column appears in over
zoo newspapers the world over.

“Elsie Robinson, top Hear-stian
‘sob Sister,‘ is a valuable syndicat-
ed addition to the Hearst chain of
newspapers. Her ‘womanly point
of view’ on current affairs is
worth while and offers sentimental
slants to the purely impersonal
news reporting.

“One of the foremost dramatic
critics, among both men and worn-
en, is Eleanor Bames, Los Angeles
Daily News' motion picture editor.
Her columns on films in Manches-
ter Boddy's famed tabloid are reli<
able frank and honest. Besides
ed ng movie copy, Miss Barnes is
music and theatre critic for the
News.

“Fay King and Nell Brinkley,
well known artists and columnists.
have illustrated columns appear-
ing almost daily in a large chain
of papers.

“Margaret Fuller, member or
Horace Greeley's Tribune staff
from 1344 to 1846, was the first
important woman writer to take
part in daily newspaper work. She
also, at one time, co-edited a mag—
azine, The Dial.

“Bonfils and Tammen, til-st pub-
lishers of the Denver Post, ace
claimed Polly Pry, news reporter
on the initial Post staff, the most
distinguished and valuable jour-
nalist on their paper. Miss Pry,
even at that early date, was given
important assignments on some of
the most sensational happenings
of the age, and was undoubtedly
one of the pioneer trail blazers for
the Womenrin-joumalism frontier "

COLLEGIATE REVIEW
