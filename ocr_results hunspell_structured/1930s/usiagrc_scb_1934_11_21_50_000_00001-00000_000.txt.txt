E of 1934 Season

By FRANK BEATLF.
Blocking and tackling, those iunda.
mentals without which, ior some rea—
son or other, iootball teams do not
go places very last, were being given
due consideration this week by the
remaining members of the Pioneer
grid squad.

This week—the last week oi prac.
ticc ior the current season—will mark
the inst extensive drill on iunda.
mentals since the opening game oi the
season with Michigan State, prompted
by the very apparent lack oi blocking
and tackling displayed by Grinnell
against Coe last week.

More Cnsualties

The possibility at a iurther curtail.
ment oi the Grinnell squad was seen
this week in the announcement that
Bob Moore, sophomore end, who has
held down a wing post during a part
oi each game this season, and Bob
hoeser, sophomore back, will be in‘-
eligible ior the closing contest with
Cornell here- Saturday unless they
make up scholastic work by this Wed.
nosday evening.

Jim Bradley, whose consistent work
at the iullback post has been one of
the high—lights oi the season. had
not yet been released Tuesday irom
the Community hospital where he is
recuperating irom a ruptured kidney,
and it is certain that he will not be
able to take part in the game,

McLeod Back

Harold “Gander" Anderson,:veteran
end, who played against Coe last week
after several days oi convalescing
irom a tonsilitis attack will again
be able to play this week, and will
be paired with Gene Klepier at end.
Bob McLeod, sophomore back, has
recovered i-rom his case oi measles
and will also see action. Neither oi
these men, however, is expected to
he in the best oi condition.

Likewise, Floyd l-iorton, “handy
man" oi the squad, who has done
good work at guard, tackle and end
positions this year, has been bothered

‘ ured knee, and Bill McFar.
lin, reserve quarterback, is still nur.
sing a wronched shoulder which has
given him trouble throughout the sea-
son.

Probable Lineup

in addition to Anderson and Moore,
Coach L, L. Watt will probably start
Sutton and Meeter at tackles, Trum—
bull and Sairis at guards, Fowler,
center; Kingery, quarterback; Clark
and Bauer, halibacks, and Fini, iull—
back.

Lane Condemns
World’s Present
Day Indifference

"We have no business to bc bother.
ed by trivalities," said the Rev, Stod.
dard lane oi the Plymouth Congre-
gational church in Des Moines at
Vespers Sunday. “A lot oi people
need to learn the motto ‘think nothing
oi it’

"There are times, however, when
you can’t resort to that motto," he
went on. Depression is too costly
in human terms ior anyone to say
"think nothing oi it". There are
times when we must be proioundly
disturbed; there are tacs with which
we should be proioundly concerned,

More people like 5. Parkes Cad.
man, Francis Perkins, and Upton Sm.
clair, who get disturbed about things,
are needed in this country today.
For you're not human unless you get
disturbed; “you're only a vegetable,"
declared Dr. Lane.

“It hurt me to hear everybody pok.
ing iun at Upton Sinclair," continued
the speaker. “We ought to appreci.
ate that here is a man deeply Con-
cerned about poverty, and that all part-
ies should have for their motto, ‘End
Poverty in AmeriCa’_"

“Too oiten we have cruciﬁed Christ
again by our tranquility and calm.
ness," asserted Rev. Lane. “it's ‘a
sad slpry. Christians not _ tak-
ing things to héa~7christians who
‘think noth g oi it‘ ,

in ~conclusion, Dr. Lane pointed out
that we should all be iollowers oi
Jesus, and "the true iollowers of
Jesus are those who take thmgs terr.
ibly to hearL“"
