l Campus Opinion

Do you favor having classes Mon-
Llay after Christmas vacation to com-
[lensaw for no Classes Friday of the
Tlmnksgiiing recess, as wits done
this year, or returning to the schedule
used last year?

Irene Clark: I think that it is much
better to have the extra day at
Thanksgiving rather than at Christ
mas. One day more or less during the
Christmas holidays doesn’t make so
much difference, but the one day at
Thanksgiving does if you want to go
home.
> Francis Hawk: In my most humble
and Contrite opinion, I believe that
such change Should he made. Friday
after Thanksgiving will be something
01,91 strange interlude in which home

on: may be made up,

. Elizabeth Herroﬂ: I am in favor of
returning on Jan. 5 after Christmas
and having Thanksgiving Friday, be-
cause it is easier to start work on
onday than on Tuesday.
Many people enjoy the Thanksgiving
'v'a'éatiou so much that they would
hate to give it up.
“Willis Crews> It doesn’t make a
bit of difference to me. I live in Crime
.ne11.-- '
‘ Mary neclnnan: Christmas vaca-
tion is long enough that one day
‘makes little difference. The extra day
at Thanksgiving makes it possible
foremost people to spend that vhcae
,tion at home.
