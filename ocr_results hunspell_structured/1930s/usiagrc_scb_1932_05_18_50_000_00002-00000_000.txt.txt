THE NEW EXAMINATION SYSTEM

The comprehensive system, as announced in to.
day’s Scarlet and Black, will look to some under»
classmcn like a bi bogey popping up between them

' lllKl a diploma, Willi its suggestion of responsihilitv
for work studied several months before. it will illi-
clouhtcdly throw zl heavy responsibility of review
on the student.

For this very reason it will he of very great
value. If stlldmlts have to remember some of the
things they learn fol seven or eight months instead
of one or two, there u 11 he that much greater po
sihility that. they Will our . them away into then
business and professional work.

Moreover, it ought to make the student’s hur-
deil lighter ill some ways. It should cause the touch-
ers to emphasize less the details that will he for.
gotten ill a few weeks, and to emphasize more the
details which can be permanently retained. and
which are worth retaining.

Prollnhly the most important effect of the
change will he to compel the greatest of car in
choice of a major sub] at. If the student is going
to he asked to review when he is ll senior some of
the things he learned when a freshman. and is ex
pectod to do some vacation reading and studying
ill his major subject, he is going to choose a suhjoct
which he is willing to stay with. It should he a
subject closely allied to his chosen occupation after
leaving college. C‘ ,

MERITS OF THE MAY FETE

opportllnit to attend all outdoor pageant such as
the one pi‘e. ented by the Vthlllt‘li’s Physical Educ. -

Such a pageant giles the members of the sill.

The work done was pro 'cwortlly from the

THE FLAME THAT LIGHTS THE FIRE
(From the Duily Trojlm)

in the little town of Sarajevo, situated in the Bal.
kans, the Archduke of Austria was assassinated by an
unknown fanatic. A single pistol shot was all that was
necessary to set off the fires of hatred and enmity that
had been smouldering for years, and when once fanned
into brilliance by the death of the Archduke, resulted
in the World War.

A little less than 13 years afterwards, when the
nations who were exhausted by the ravages of the
World War were again built up to huge military
strength, when the peace treaties have almost been for-
gotten, another pistol shot, fired into the brain of the
president of France, arouses that nation and sends its
agents to look for the possible connection between the
assassin and soviet Russia, If such a thing is found,
or if indications pull-ii: to Russia’s influence in the killing,
whether they be entirely true or not, the fury of the
French nation will be aroused, and shooting will serve
as another excuse for another wholesale slaughter.

France, it. is known in certain quarters, is bound
by treaties which will in time of need, take her into
direct conflict with the Soviet Union. It. is entirely
probable that Japan will side in with France should
any trouble arise between Russia. In a situation such as
this a killing by a Russian of the president of France,
el en though he is but a figurehearl in the French state,
assumes more than European importance, and unless
it can be proven to the French surete that the killing
was provoked entirely in the deformed mind of a
pseudo-patriot, the affair will most likely incite strained
relations between Paris and Moscow to such an extent
that war will result. -

7G—
HANG THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!
(From the sinipaonimi)

Usually the mother tongue amply satisfies our
linguistic wants, but there are times when every writer
would like to disown it and start afresh in some new,
strange speech.

Why must some words keep cropping out like rocks
on a New England farm? Go down any page of any
newspaper at random. “Problem”, “measure". “depres;
sion", “student”, “organization”, “Convention", “plan"
the trite, lifeless words wearily return your weary stare.
Why must certain dead phrases and stale metaphors
write themselves into one's work whenever he sets
pen to paper?

There is hardly an adjective that the advertise-
ments have not killed. “Vital" had been trampled to
death by the politicians; “scintillating” calls up, not
starlight, but the painted wenches of the screen. When
you find novel synonyms for these hackneyed locations
your work lapses form the colorless into the ludicrous.
When, despairing of modern English, you attempt
archaism, your writings become unintelligible. You
write in your simplist Saxon and you write something
silly; you plaster your paper with polysyllables and the
reader wonders what the catch is.

The English languageiat least the American diao
lectihas had the juice wrung out of it by the pressure
of modern life (stupid metaphor, that). Let us go to
the places where they speak Portuguese, Malay, Raro~
tongan, Namacqua, Kusaien, Rumanscb, Samoyede, or
Mpongwe, and start our linguistic life all over'again.

MG,
SUCCESS
(From the Daily Northwestern)

June, commencement and prosperity are just around
the corner, altho as everyone knows, the former is
almost certain‘to get here. Those seniors who have per-
severed to the earl. and gained salvation are not facing
the prospects of graduation any too gladly. For four
years they have studied, more or less, to prepare them.
selves for the realities of the business and professional
world. Their psychology professors have written books
telling them how to deal with people already successful
so that the graduates may be successful, too. students
have participated in every sort of, activity, from big—
time athletics to presiding over a. non-active Men’s
union, in order that the publicity gained thereby may
get them contacts and jobs. But all activities and sheep
skins put together will not reach very far into the
abyss in which the present economic system has fallen.

But. the fact remains that these graduates have
had it drilled into their system that the acme of success
is “to arrive,” and ”to arrive” means either a very
substantial income or a great deal of publicity. Amer-
ica has always ballyhooed itself as the land of oppor-
tunity and the only requisite for being a millionaire
or president of the nation is hard work.

If the present situation continues in the world
outside, our criterias of success are bound to change.
Such a change is already asserting itself in our educa—
tional system. More and more students are coming to
college in order to learn how to bye and not to learn
how to get a. living. The professional schools are doing
an admirable work in diffusing technical knowledge.
But their task is confined solely with the problem of
equipping men and women to get a living. The college of
art, attempts, or at least should try to, to prepare for
living,
