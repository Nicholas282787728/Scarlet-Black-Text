‘Mankind an lOganism’
Butterick Claims

Urging that men must realize
that the nations of the world are
one indivisihle organism. Dr.
George A. Buttrick. pastor of the
M a d is o n Avenue Piesbyterian
church. New York city. gave the
first of five Gates lectures at the
Herrick chapel yesterday morning
entitled, “The conflict of Loyal:
ties."

Mankind is an organism. we are
members one of another. but the
“modern world refuses the truth
that we are an organism." Dr.
Buttrick said. Emphasizing this
point. he declared that one nation
cannot remain neutral in a war
unless it is wining to pay the
price. He added that there is
always the cry of certain ins
dustries against neutrality. To
this there are two answers: that
right and good people do not covet
certain kinds of profit. and that
every time some one has to sacri-
tice.

Nothing but the Slate .

Dr, Butti—ick declared that Fess
cism ignores the universal embrace
and discards the idea of perpetual
peace for it decrees that there is
nothing beyond the state: but he
asserted this doctrine of ”beyond
the state nothing" is not a tenable
one.

Today the need is for more so-
cial planning. while yesterday the
strong individual was needed to
pioneer; that need ended when we
began to talk of conservation ot
resources,” cemented the speak»
er. .

, Best of Motives

By quoting from John Gals-
worthy's play “Loyalties” in which
one of the characters says, “Criss—
cross, cries-cross. criss-cross. we
all cut one another's throats from

.ihc best of motives . Dr. Buttrick
‘pointed out that the very statement
is one of the most important prob-
lems of the day.

Further. in explanation of his
main point of indubiteble unity.
he asserted that “isolation ends by
being anarchy because we are
members one of another An eye
must protect itself. but it must
also protect the body when it sees
an automobile coming. in the
same way. we must be loyal to
all mankind."

“We've all kept faith but it is
not enough. Patriotism is not
enoug he said quoting Edith
Cevcll.

Need Greater Loyalty

oiir need today is for some over-
spreading loyalty to gather all the
little loyalties together; Jesus laid
that encompassing feeling ovcr the

world. said the speaker,
t The Christian solving of the
hurt of the world is not in capi-
talism. not in partiotism. but in
the recognition that man is anl
organism and that organism rul-
filis its being‘s law. Dr. Buttrick
emphasized.

Ruthie]: Explains Causes
of Modern Warfare

l
l

Two principal reasons for the
existence of war were presented
by Dr. George Buttrick in the:
second of the series of Gates leer
tures at Herrick chapel Tuesday
night. In his address on “Christ
an the Changing World.” Dr.
Buttrick stated his belief that the
reasons for war were the economic]
conflicts and the fact that “war;
breeds war." !

“Preparedness for war breeds!
war.” the speaker explained. and;
pointed out that Germany. Italy
and Japan were all preparing toi-|
war today because those nationsi
felt that they did not receive a

 

fair share oi the World “My spoils,

The attitude that preparedness
brings pcace. Dr. Buttl'ick labeled
as tho “descent ot intelligence into
absurdity. We get what we pre-
pare Ior.” the speaker continued.

In explaining the economic ri-
valries which breed war. Dr Butt
rick expressed the opinion
“the advocate of peace who
nores trade as a cause of war
merely sentimental."

He told of the activities of
United States munitions makcrs‘in
South America. and the way they
played one nation off against an-
other in an attempt to sell more
armaments. Business must he will-
ing to sacrifice present profits for
future gains from peace, Mr. But-
trick stated. He believes that rage
ulation is needed in business and
that “the present system must
bend or it must break."

Dr. Buttrick answered the ques-
tion of how pence would come by
saying. “Peace will come only in
the s 'nging realization of what
life i. for Christ is our peace. who
by his cross has slain our enmity.
Nothing on earth will slay enmity
except love that is willing to suf»
fer. for it alone leaves no legacy
of bitterness or seeds of war to
come." the speaker concluded

“Ethical Approach”
Urged by Buttrick

An ethical approach will solve
the problems of industry. said Dnl
George Buttrick in his third Gatesi
Memorial lecture this morning on
“Christ and the Realm of Toll."
He drew up an indictment against
industry directly and against all of
for indirference. on the grounds.
that the capitalistic system makesi
labor monotonous and insecure,
and is wasteful. planlcss. and em—
phasizes the evils of tho proiit.

“We are Witnessing the end of
an era.” he said. A planned econ0r
my on an ethical basis is our only
way out. he declared. We must es-
tablish some form of social order
and control. working through pres~
cut instrumentalitics. with the
heads of industries as our logical
leaders Organized and cocopcrar
Live utilities. transportation, insur-
ance and banking will iemove

Need Far Seeing Lenders

A beginning has been made al—
ready by some far seeing leaders.
through pl'ofitrsharing and hous-
jing plans. but many are still sel-
ilishiy iiemusing themselves with
iphi-ases. saying that a certain pe-
centage of the population are mor~
ons and will always be poor.
i The fear that socialization will
lput more power into the hands of
l grafting politicians was answered
by Dr. Bllttlick's chargc of . even
greater graft in business. He also
.stated that the socialization which
llias already been tried has been
quite successful.

Capitalism is selfscorttradictor
he stated. in its attempt to in-
crease mass production and at the
same time concentrate the profits
to further increase production. In
order to endure. it must disperse
wealth as well as concentrate it.
he said.

To save our present order. we
need better people. hut better peo-
ple cannot be made by force. by
law. or by teaching. Dr. Buttrick
said. “Character is caught. not
taught.” he concluded. and cited
the life of Christ as our best was
ampie of one based on the kind of
ethics which can save our civilizar
tion.

German colleges and universities
have lost between so and to per
cent of their Scientific instructors.
