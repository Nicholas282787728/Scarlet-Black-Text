LET'S MAKE THIS AN
“ANNUAL" AFFAIR

The chapel program of Monday served
as a formal introduction on the campus to
the new plan for an annual sponsored by
next year’s junior class. Seemingly, the
plan met with the general approval of the
student body, as evidenced by the 470 per—
sons wllo have, thus far, indicated their
sympathy with the proposal.

The sponsoring class 'has done the
school a service through its initiating of
such a movement. Many of the students
have long been in favor of such an idea,
and this move by the present sophmore
class has served to crystalize the idea which
has been in many minds for some time.

There are still problems to be faced ill
this project. However, the able leadership
which is to be found in the sophomore class
is amply capable of handling all the prob-
lems which come in its path. We are
heartily behind any movement which would
bring back an annual as a permanent institu-
tion on this campus, and we sincerely coll-
gratulate and encourage the sophomore
class in working toward this end. More
power to you!

GRINNELL STUDENT OPINION

Two weeks ago, in keeping with the
precedent which has been set on numerous
campuses thr ughout the country, there
was taken on the Grinnell campus a poll of
student feeling on several questions dealing
with international and national policy. The
poll was taken merely out of curiosity as to
its results, and not for the benefit of any
outside organization.

The results thereof were not surprising.
On the whole, the vote supported the more
sensible viewpoint which is gradually
developing in this country. As was true
of the poll taken by Nation magazine,
approximately 85 per cent of those voting
were in favor of some form of collective
security.

One of ltwo things of interest were dis—
covered. For instance, it is interesting,

even though alarming, that 13 persons be—
lieve that war is the best way in which to
settle world problems. It was also found
that about 350, or two-thirds of those vot-
ing, declared that they would fight for the
United States government only in case our
country was invaded, while 62 voters said
they would never fight.

Also worth noticing was the fact that
only 18 students believed in the solution
offered by world socialism. Perhaps the
results on that point would have been
different if the professors had voted.

There is no particular practical value
ill taking a poll of this sort. It is doubtful
if half of those voting would react in a real
situation as they have indicated, while in a
very calm and thoughtful frame of mind.
It does show, however, that people are more
conscious of, and are doing more thinking
on the problems which face us, which gives
us some reason to hope.

G—
WORTH DOING

This week, as most of us probably
know, is National Airmail week, Tomorrow
G nnell will have its own airmail service
for a day when a plane will pick up and de-
liver mail here at 3 p. m.

It has been suggested that we might
take advantage of this special service to
send letters via air mail. Not only the usual
ones to home and friends bllt perhaps an
extra one or two which we have intended
to write for some time.

From at least one standpoint, such a
procedure would be of immense value to the
school in forcibly impressing Grinnell and
Grinnell college on outsiders through the
medium of the special stamps to be used.

IF THIS BE HERESY

Rank heresy may be the charge hurled
at lls when we come out in favor of class
struggle; and yet, on Friday afternoon there
will be a class struggle to which we give
our wholehearted support.

The renewal of the annual tug-of-war
between the freshmen and the Sophomores
is looked forward to by the class of ’40 as
sweet revenge for last year' defeat. Alld
what could be more pleasing to the preps
than to see their oppressors dragged
through the golf course pond? Go to it ’40
and '41; we’re for you.

IT REALLY SMELLS

It' has colne to our attention that Grin-
nell men who believe in and practice the old
adage “cleanliness is next to godliness" are
encountering unexpected difficulties due to
solne hidden fault in the quality of the hot
water supplied in the dormitories.

Specifically, the complaint is that the
water literally "smells."
first glance of minor importance, becomes
worthy of attention when men are forced to
adopt cold showers and shave with cold
water. Those who have ever done the
latter will agree that the humor of the
situation has long since passed.

Seriously, we suggest that investigation
of this matter is ill order. Such odors may
be the first indication of possibly dangerous
contamination in the water supply. At the
,very least, they indicate a condition which
is unpleasant.

OVERSOUEEZING . . .

(Reprinted from the Daily O’Collegian)

Behind the shiny soda counter a young
man is working to squeeze the juice out of
some lemons. He puts a moderate amount
of pressure on the fruit and then throws it
away—with one third of the juice still in it.
Why ‘1 Why doesn't he spend more time,
squeeze the lemon harder and recover more
of the juice.

Because he knows that the additional
juice is not worth the effort to get it. In
the same way perhaps we as students are
pressing certain phases of our college life
too hard. Perhaps we should change «
try something else.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

To the editor of the Scarlet and
Black: May IGAThe front page
notice concerning the appearance
of our campus and referring DELF
ticulsrly to the new planting at
the A. R. H. is all to the good.

However, credit should go
where it belongs, and in this cnse
the credit is riot (Inc the bd-
ministration, but belongs entire‘y
to Dr. Edward A. steinci- who
made the suggestion and who is
helping out on the cost of this
planting.

In coming to Work this morn-
ing. I noticed that the center
campus was prctty \vell littered
with blue paper. all of which
could have been avoided if the
students thcmsslvcs would take a
little pride in the looks of their
surroundings. ‘

Your help is very much ap-
preciated and we hope that dur-
ing the next year some progress
will be made in keeping the cam-
pus orderly.

Our funds for this purpose are
quite limited, so any help given
by the students will be appreciat-
ed,

iLouis v. Phelps, Ti-chsurcr.

BOOK LOOKS

By Rebekah Hash

it's well written, just like ‘Old.
Jules’,” said David E. Peck of
Mari Sandoz’ “Slogum House"
(rental shelf), “but there is no
excuse for its being as dirty as it
is. I lived with those people
from 1387 to 1900; I should know.
it reminds me of the old saying.
‘.A man will say what he is afraid
to writs, but a woman will write
what she is afraid to say'“ (You
can decide whether Mari is male
or female.) Mr. Peck went on to
shy that “Danger Is My Business”
(rental shelf) by John D. Craig
is the best book of its kind he
has read in a long time.

“R, F. n." (reuml shell) by

not always the ’distinction you
think it is because some of their
selections certainly don't rank
with the immortals, but this book
is n clever, quiet, penetrsut study
of life on the rural free delivery.
