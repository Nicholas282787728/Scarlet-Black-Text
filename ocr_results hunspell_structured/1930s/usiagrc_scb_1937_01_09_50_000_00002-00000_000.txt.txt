WE DISAGREE!

Many different interpretations have been placed on the recent
seizures on the high seas of Spanish merchantmen by the German
cruiser Koenigsberg. Gcrmany has been called a reckless and fool-
haiviy provocateur of war. an aggressor of a weaker nation, and a
violator of international law. We are inclined to feel that, while
such epithets arc in part justifiable, they in no ivay explain Ger-
many's action.

When we examine the history of Germany since the World War.
particularly under the Hitler regime, we feel that the motivating
factors underlying German foreign and domestic policy are the dog-
ged determinations of all the German people to reestablish their
economic security and their political equality. Such events reprcseiit
a very \Velladefmed policy on the part of the Hitler government to
achieve once again a completely autonomous state, free from foreign
domination.

We must not make the mistake of underestimating the power
latent in Mr. Hitler's moves toward this objective, though we may
question seriously the wisdom of some of his means to his end. The
present aid supplied to the Spanish rebels is an attempt to lnsuxe the
continued flow of Spanish iron ore to German foundries. This inter-
ference would never have occurred had it not been for the injustice
done Germany when all her supply was given to France or to Poland
by the Versailles treaty or by an arbitrary League of Nations.

Mr. Hitler offered on several different occasions proposals for
general disarmament, and then re-armed with astonishing rapidity
and thoroughness when his offers were rejected, Germany demands
security and equality, and Mr. Hitler is not bluffing in his attempts
to get them.

It is up to the rest of the world to decide whether or not these
problems are to be solved with justice and peace or with stupid selfr
ishness and war.

WHY DESPAIR?

About a year ago Sherwood Eddy was in Arkansas. He saw
many fami cs shivering by the snowy roadside. They had been evict-
ed from their homes because they had joined the Southern Tenant
Farmers union. Their problems moved him to action, and he found
a 2,138 acre plantation on the Mississippi delta for sale at so an acre
cash. He made the first payment out of his own resources, and
asked his friends to raise subscriptions for the rest. They responded
by raising over $13,000 above the cost of the farm. Thirty-three of
the evicted families from Arkansas were invited to be members.
That was the beginning of the Delta Cooperative farm.

During their first year, in spite of beginning late in the season
and facing the bad drought which burned the corn and vegetables
and damaged the cotton, they sold enough lumber and cotton to make
a profit of 27 per cent on the capital investment of nearly $31,000
Besidcs that the members have already built for themselves with
their own lumber some 25 buildings.

The members, formerly oppressed, ignorant farmers. both black
and white, work together in idcal cooperation. They emphasize rec
ligion and religious motives in their work. As fast as they can they
will return the capital to a revolving fund to start other such pro-
jects.

Why do educated people despair of solving our problems of un—
employment and poverty when ignorant farmers can do so well7
Surely this is a lesson for us to drop our inertia and discouragement
and do something constructive.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Critic Believes Five Paintings
Provide Cosmopolitan Note

“Blue Room” lmpresses‘

Writer With Appeal 1

to Aesthetic l
Bylmfmlr amEN

Dining the bleak winter season,
when we feel cut off in Sllowbound‘
isolation from the rest of the;
world, it is indeed pleasant to,
hear an authentic it faint iiotc ofi
cosmopolitan activity. Such ai‘
cultural stimulus is presented in}
the two pictures now on view in
the Quadrangle. The canvases in
this collectionithrce of them
have Won pl‘izcsiwei'e personally
chosen by Dr. R. B, Hat-she, di
rector of the Chicago Art Insti~l
tute; they will remain at Grinnéll-
during the month of January.

its the spectator takes his first
survey of the paintings, the dra-
matic color of “The End of the
Hunt” by Dale Nichols catches
his eye. A crimson barn stands
out against a bright blue sky and,
an expanse of blllerwhlte snow; in
the foreground a hunter is seen,
returning home. The hard poster-
like effect is reminiscent of the
work of Grant Wood. although, in
this picture at least, Mr. Nichols
gives no evidence of the satiric
touch that is so much a part of
Mr. Wood's artistic personality.
“The End of the Hunt" with its
contrast of cold still snow and
the warm red barn delights the
eye both bccause of the vivid
color scheme and the simplicity
of the composition; there is some-
tliiiig thrilling about this ievcl —
tion of thc decorative boat tv in
landscapes familiar to all of us.

Atkmcntd by “Blue Room"

if Dale Nichols canvas catl r
the eye as one approaches the c
hibition, it is "The Blue Room” by
Constantine Poiigialis which af-
fects the heart or soul or what
ever organ is the seat of man's
acstlictic emotion Cezanne—like in
its tecling for body, in its grasp
of three dimensional form, "The
Blue Room“ is primarily a picture
of mood. The figure of the u-cin»
an crcatcs a sense of weary r st,
enhanced by the somber bluc gray
color. This critic, for one, found
it the most satisfying picture in
the group.

Charles Killgol'e's "Taxco Misr-
hat" is an agrceablc it not ,_
exciting view of a square in a Me
ican city Somewhat similar in
subject matter, Francis C dpin's
“Street. Scene, Taxco” looks like
an uninspired sketch for ii dreary
mural; it neither excites the mind
nor awakens the emotions tit-i-
charms the eye.

Animated Composition

Julio De Diego, 3 Spaniard now
living in Chicago, is represented
by “Grant Place," a scene of chil-
dren playing on the sidewalk in
front of a city house, The comr
position is animated, the coloring
rich and meridional. Some spectar

toi may rccoil before the di.
tortcd figures, but the writer feels
that in some way, which he can’t
analyze, the distortion contributes
to the distinctive personality, the
strong character of the painting
and that it need in no way detract
from onc's Joy in the sense of
rhythm and the color pattcrn.

it is always stimulating to see
before one the actual flowering- of
the creative impulses of one’s own
race and age, These canvases. ai-
though the names of several of
the painters indicate their foreign
ancestry, are variously character
istic of Middle Western art. No
one rightfully associated with a
liberal arts college can fail to find
the exhibit deserving of a visit;
most of us will find in one or an-
other of these figure or lands
scape pictures the unmistakable
exhilaration and sense of power
that come in the presence of a
work of art which realizes our oivn
vague appreciation of the beautr
fill and the significant.
