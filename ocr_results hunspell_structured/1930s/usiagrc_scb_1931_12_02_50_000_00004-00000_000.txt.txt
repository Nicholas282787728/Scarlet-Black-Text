Would you chance this ranking?

octli Barnard: This system would
be quite satisfactory, but why not
put less emphasis on intelligence and
more on sense of humor?

ivyiioiin Eivoldt: if it is possible
to rank men in terms of percent i
believe this system to be as good as
any. with this exception: I would
rank personality equal with personal
appearance and reduce the sense of
humor to 5%.
Mary Gary: I would rank person-
ality out above personal appearance
and dancing ability at 10% instead
of 5%.
Grace Striicl - Intelligence and
cultural background are of little
avail unless a man can put them into
practical use. Why not 15 points for
ambition?
Helen Parzyholt: By all means in»
telligence should be rated first. How—
ever. personal appearance, physical
fitness, social poise, and personality
should all come under cultural back-
grounosthere are too many head-
ings.
Erma Cole: To correspond with the
Grinnell standards I think that danc-
ing ability should be rated as 15%
at least. Personality and social poise
might be combined under one heads
ing and rated as 20%. Also, the
seventh item might be omitted.
Otherwise I would agree with the
ranking as it stands.
Dorothy Doorllcr: 1 agree that
such a system of ranking is desir—
able, but I think that personality
should be rated equally with person-

Mixed Dinners Discussed
by Spangler, League Board

Frank Spangler has been appointed
by the council of house chairmen to
confer with members of the wo-
men’s self government league about
mixed dinners to be held at the dermis
tory and quadrangle dining rooms.
The idea was started here two
years ago with buildings and cat-
tages alternately entertaining. It has
been continued intermittently, but no
mixed dinners have been held this
year.

Helen Williams, instructor, tonight.

George 0. Seiver, assistant pro-
fessor of French, will present several
plays to the group and the members

presentation.

On Other Hills

Due to the refusal of the coeds to
conform to the. 50-50 idea, men of
the University of Washington were
forced to abandon their "depression

which failed recently at the Univen

Students Trade
Hogs, Chickens
for Education

Students working their way
through college are merely part of an
old and familiar story at most col-
leges now, but when it comes to bar-
gaining for tuition with cows, hogs,
chickens, eggs, anti all sorts of‘rfarm
produce except possibly corn “llkker”
it‘s something to watch.
If you have a few hogs which
you'd like to trade for a college edu-
cation, however, just haul them down
to Clarksville, Ark., and tell your
problem to the College of the Ozarks.
there. Most of the students there
are mountaineers cf the Ozarks \thI
have been overlooked by a part of,
modern civilization and its Capitalrl
istic prosperity. Consequently . thel
college isn't particular about what
the students bring to pay the tuition
charges. .

Flour Sock Underwear
Silk hose and lace steprlns are en-
tirely fcreigm -to coed tshere who at-‘
tend college in homespun, homemade ‘
dresses and wear underwear convert-;
ed from flour sacks. The men are

vivid tales of the “store clothes"I
which they find in the wide and for
eign world. ' .
Teachers work for a lower salary
at the College of the Ozarks, how~
ever, for the satisfaction of teaching
to men and women who are really
students. They are intelligent," am-
bitious, athletic, and as a group pos-
ployment on the 130-acre farm
sess a gift for music and an in
desire for knowledge.

Charge $325 Yearly .,
Although the college charges only
3325 a year for tuition, board, room,
and everything else, 35 per cent of
its students cannot pay that and
must work out their education.
Consequently, the college operates
a farm, a canning factory, a dairy, a
garment factory, and a print shop.
In addition, the students do all the
work connected with the institution.
Nearly 40 coeds work in the gar-
ment factory which turns out ”Oz-
ark Mai " garments for city dwellers,
and from 15 to 20 students find oin-
Tlie students canned 3,500 gallons
of peaches last summer for college
use. They cook, serve meals, do all
the janitor service, and all common
labor in connection with erection of
buildings.
