couicrciicc meet in st. Louis.

Grinnell swimmers will meet all
of their conference rivals in dual
meets and then again at st. Louis
for the loop championship, the 1931
schedule announced
by Coach Elton A. Rosen shows,

Both Washington university and
Oklahoma A. and M., who were not
included on the 1930 schedule, have
been added to the program as dual
meets. The Washington Bears won
the conference meet last year, and re-
ports point to another strong team,

Creighton Meet Jim. 16

Drake, who boasts another well
balanced squad of tanlrsters, will
meet Grinnell twice, once at Des
Moines and then in Grinnell. Coach
Rosen, new to Grinnell college this
year, has been working his team
daily, and he indicates that the squad
is making progress. Individual at-
tention has been stressed.

The first dual meet, against
Creighton, will be held in the Grip-
nell pool, and the entire squad is ex-
pected to be in shape for this event.
Creighton introduced swimming on
its athletic program last year for
the first time, and the Bluejay tanlr
team this year probably will not be
in the class of the teams that Grin-
nell will meet later in the season.

botanist of the University of Iowa,

Science club, which will be held Mon-

Lindbergh Story
by Clayton Gets
Radio Comment

“And then there arc people who
frequent the movies and think that
cvery successful reporter must he of
the Bill Hairies type. We have lmuwn

interview with Lindbergh, which was
secured, not when the ﬂyer was
making his scheduled tour, but when
he was a guest of Hanford lilac-
Nider at Mason City, and interviews
were strictly forbidden.

Sinclair Lewis Discharged
ziinring also told of Sinclair Lewis,
who was at one time discharged from

 

it Waterloo newspaper, and Carl D.
Gal‘tnel', now city editor of the Trih-
une, who was oncc praised by Cams
eron Beck, personnel director oi the
New York stock exchange, as the
“best reporter” ever to interview him.

Clayton, now a junior rtl. Grinncll,
is editor of the 1932 Cyclone, campus
editor of The Scarlet and Black, and
a member of the Maltcuscr stall. He
is also campus representative for a
number of newspapcrs,
