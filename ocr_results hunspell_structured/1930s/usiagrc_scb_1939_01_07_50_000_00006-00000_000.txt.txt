GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1938

 

RANDOM
SPORT Slims

By Clark Smith'—

Coach John 0. Triiesdale was for
from satisfied with the schedule
for the current southern trip the
basketball team is on now. Pl'c-
viously, the pioneers have
ways had it arranged so that the
first game came on a Saturday
night. The next day they could
rest and get their traveling done
without any difficulty. This would
put the cagers in good shape for
the Monday game and the third
contest played on Tuesday would
find the team not too exhausted
from their travels and their play-
ing.
t a a

At the conference meeting, in
which this year's schedules were
drawn up, the southern schools
refused to give Truesdale that
same schedule which would allow
his team to play two games in
good condition. Instead, he was
forced to play games on Fiiday
and Saturday night. This meant
a sleeper jump right after the
first contest and only a few
hours of rest and relaxation be-
fore playing the second game. The

last game played on Monday
would find a tired Gi'inell team
on the floor despite their one day
rest, Each opponent on the trip
lwouid also he playing its first
game and the last two teams
eould scout the Pioneeis if they
fso desired.

Perhaps the outstanding feature
of this year’s Pioneer team is
their balanced scoring strength.
Every man possesses a good score
ing eye and the team doesn't
have to depend on any one man
for all its points. Turner, Fort,
Nash and Luther are dead shots
from almost any position on the
floor Luick and Peisner are best
in shots off the backboard and
around the free throw lane. Capt.
lBob Berry doesn't shoot much but

plays from the hack court. He is
a good shot from far out on the
floor but prefers to play a strict
team game and work the ball in
on fast breaks under the basket.

“Furthermore," he added, “the

year, so Grinnell is having an-
other severe test for the second
successive night.

Aftei Lanlgllt’ battle with the

Ti-iiesdnle Pessimistic.

However, Coach John 0. True:-

'dale was frankly pessimistic be

fore he left with the team and
expressed the doubt that this
yem": squad could again turn the
trick. “There are several factors
against us," he explained, “First,
Wasliburn, the Aggies, and Till-
sa will all he playing their first
game against 'us. That means that
the last two schools can scout
us and will have fresh teams to
send against our boys who will
undoubtedly he quite tired,"
Truesdale went on to explain
that each of the three schools had
teams that were definitely rated
as title contenders in the Miss

lsuuri Valley conference.

physical condtion of three of our
men is very uncertain, and a loss
of any one of them would claim»
liteiy put us out of the running."
Injury Problem.

The injured men were John
Turner with a broken nose and
Fred Luther and Verne Robinson
With partially crippled knees.

As a safeguard against injur-
ies, the Pioneer cage mentor took
along a large traveling squad of
ten men. Besides those already
mention were Capt. Berry, James
Nash, Jeri—y Fort, Gene Peisner,
Wilbur Luick, George Tompkins
and Don Ruliffson.

The main weakness in Gi'innell's
team are these injuries that are
causing so much doubt as to the
future of the Pioneers.

Team Has Spirit.

Truesdale must play each game
as it comes, not figuring on the
future, hilt seeing that the team
is giving everything it has while
it is at full strength.

A good season is in prospect
if the squad wins two of the
games on this road trip and no
one is injured.

Team morale is at the highest
pitch that it's been in many seas
sons and every man is a danger-
eus shot, which has given the
team an excellent shooting per-
centage to date.
