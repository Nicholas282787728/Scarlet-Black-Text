The Pioneer goll team is hov-
ing an exceptionally good year as
witness of their performances
against st, Ambrose, Cornell and
Iowa state. It seems to us that
the divot diggers are cerainly de—
serving a just reward for their
fine performances The most
logical thing to do would be to
send them to the Missouri Valley
ccnference meet in st. Louis,

The Cornell tennis team that

that its school was looking for-

three lettermen for next year.
"We expect to be even tougher,"
they admonished. It looks like
Grinnell picked ‘a tarter for their
opening game next fall.

If the two mile relay team
doesn't win at Eeloil. Friday
night, it won’t. be because two
of the hoys on the quartet have
the wrong names. Randall Morti-
mer-s actions on the cinder path
has earned him the cognomen of
“Bullet." while Bud Pederson re-
sponds readily to the name.
“Rocket." Pair those two with
“Slugger" and “Seeg” and the
Pioneer track squad really has
something in the way of a com-
hination of nicknames.

French Play--

Continued from page 1

tiire of two American tourists
whose attempts to get coffee and
doughnuts from a French proe
vincial innkeeper produced cof—
fee andia “slightly used" auto-
mobile tire.

More than individual excel-
lence. it was the spirited ensemr
ble work of the group playing
under Elbert Smith's direction
that was responsible for the fact
that ”a good time was had by
all" last night; in fact the actors
seemed to enloy themselves just
as much as the audience.

Perhaps Jeannette appeared to
dive rather than to fall into the
washtub. but the stage business
here was admittedly difficult and
the use of actual water in the
tub made the episode convincing
and helped to satisfy the wells
known American fondness for
sadistic entertainment. Perhaps
also the French was spoken gen—
erally with an easily recognizable
American accent. but that only
made it easier for the audience to
follow.

The smoothness with which the

 

casts as a whole performed m a
foreign tongue was indeed grati-
fying. Deserving of special men-
tion are the mii‘Lhrproducing pari-
tomime of Suzanne Gillis and Air
bert Manny in the domestic farce,
the really excellent French of
Jean Fulton as one of the molds
in the inn. and the acting of
Howard Townsend in the role oi
the innkeeper.

It is perhaps rather late to my
form those who missed the per»
formance that their amusement
would have been but slightly les-
sened by a total ignorance of the
French language. The comic ac-
tions in the first play and the
major roles played by two Eng-
lishaspeaking characters in the
second one made the humor im—
mediately understandable to any-
one who had eyes to see and a
knowledge of English.
