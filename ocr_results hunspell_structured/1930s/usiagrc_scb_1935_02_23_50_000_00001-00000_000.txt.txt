“A Wily must be found by which
nations may have their claims judged
impartially and by which Changes in
the international scene may be brought
about pacifically," So declared Leon.

ican people desire peace, but to wish
peace is not enough,” the speaker
stated, The various attempts by the
nations to affect peace without an in.

having failed. The Kellogg pact, the
Washington Disarmament conference
and the London Naval treaty were
noted as examples, Political nostrums
such as preparedness, old.style diplo.
macy, disarmament, education, re .
gion, pacifist and communism were
cited by the speaker as having failed
to administer to the security of world
peace.

Real Desire for Peace

Mr. Cromie emphasized the need for
ihe entrance of the United States into
the League of Nations, stating that
such adherence would render the Lea.
gue a powerful factor for mtcrnational
world peace.

Iii conclusion, the speaker stated that
“membership in the League of Nations
and the World Court should be the
cornerstone of a sound American for.
eign policy for peace."

might have had of gaining a share in
their first Missouri Valley champion.
ship. The score at the end of the
regular playing time was lz.all, but
in the extra period the Bears found
the hoop for four quick baskets, while
Cliphant was the only Grinnellian to
score,

While the Pioneers were tripped,
Drake met with better success in a
game with Tulsa on the latter’s home
court, and now holds second place in
the conference standings. with Grinuell
in third.

Martintoni Stars

Roy Martlntoni, Washington center,
was unstoppable and found the net for
eight baskets and five free throws
to lead his team to victory. Mason
and oliphant were hitting well for
Grinnell, accounting for is and 12
points, respectively, but the rampage
of the Bear star proved too much of
a handicap.

The Pioneers started well, building
up a 10.3 lead during the first part
of the initial period. Near the end
of the half. however,, Washington be.
gan to hit the hoop and the half.time
gun found the count tied at 12.12.

Defenses Falter

1n the final half both teams aband.
oned defensive tactics in an effort to
outscorc each other, with the result
that 70 points were piled up in this
period. Regaining the lead as ‘the half
started, the Ploneers were out ahead
until only 10 minutes of the game re.
maincd. At this point the Bears gain.

For the rest of the game the teams
alternated in scoring, but Grinnell was
never again headed during the reg.

to play the scarlet and black quintet
led 40 to 37, and apparently had the
game on ice. The Bioneers refused to
stall. however, and in trying to scorc
again lost the ball.

A Washington man was fouled in
looping the ball from the center of
