CrthherTells
of ‘Way Out’

English Editor Discusses
World Economics

A possible “order out of scone
omic chaos" in Europe was ex-
plained in three ways by Geoffrey
Crowtber, editor of the Econom»
ist and News Chronicle of Lon-
don, Eng, in his lecture on that
subject at Herrick chapel last
night.

He said a way out was now
probable because the people of
Europe realize that high tariff is
a painful necessity, one to be rid
of as soon as at all possible;
second, that the world is in fora
period of rising prices because
never has there been such a large
surplus available without a rise
in prices and never has there
been such a surplus of money;
and third, the argument for the
devaluation of gold is coming to
be favored. »

Currency Devolution Inevitable.

“Within the next 12 months
the remaining currency in Eur-
ope will be scaled down as in
England and the United States,"
he said. Explaining that Europe
dreads inflation more than any-
thing else, he added that this
was unfortunate for in depres~
sion the value of currency must
be lowered to return to economic
stability.

“Economic depression could be
relieved if all would lower the
value of gold," be said, “but
many believe that depression is
far better."
