ARMISTICE DAY

Fifteen years ago today the nations laid down
tllci arms and left the battle fields to go homo
again. They left behind them in Flanders Field
ten million of their fellow men; they tool: home
with ”mm a bill for $ ,000.000_0'00 to he paid
by their children and their children’s children.

Today tlle people of eve - town and village ill
Alnt‘rica celebrated that great Nm‘clllllcr ll of 15
.ers ago, but they celebrated it ill differcllt ways.
Sonic saw it as the day on which :‘lllt‘l'lttﬂ stood
v‘ ol-iolls over a defeated foo: others saw it as the
day n hell the whole, world gained a long Solilell.
peace.

This lllOl‘l‘Illln' a cannon was dedicated ill
Grillnell, and during the years to come we shall
see it daily in the park, but we shall see it in
different wl . Some will see it ill the instrument
behind which America was able to hold her head
high alld force all enemy to bow before her. Those.
people will probably seek for Alllerioa more t‘nu-
nous ill order that we ma ' rto forth again to bring
future enemies to llulllillatlon before us, Otlle
will not soc it as the proud instrulllellt of V'IUIUI).
but rather as the rain and death and desolation
which brought pain and misery to Victor as well
as to vanquished. Their hope will be for America
not to build more cannons. but to destroy those
she already has.

in Chapel a few days ago a ng speaker
closed his tall: with the quotation of a re which
is printed on a memo 'al cannon on the campus
of a Scotland university. lts thought would apply
well llel .

“0n lei ’ mouth I clapped a hand‘

Your youth come forth at my command

And all you worked for, prayed and planned

My voice made clulllhle

And now nae wiser do you stand

And nae more humble."

AFFAIRS OF VITAL INTEREST

In his Convocation address on “Natiollalislll.”
the Rev. Stoddard Lane condemned the prevailing
tendency to teach nationalism in the schools or"
many countl-i . Is that, however, any more worthy
of condemnation than an attitude of complete illr
difference to all questions outside the immediate
scope of the students’ lives? The average Alnc
college student too prone to adopt a “lai
fairc” attitude ill connection with national and
world questions.

Students can become aroused over questions
which are of immediate concern to their interests.
For instance, not long before the Rev. Mr. Lane’s
address, the student hotly drew up a petition to
protest a ollerday vacation at Thanksgiving time.
We do not intimate that this project was not of
importance, because we believe that it was.

However, is the struggle of the National Title
covery Act of le. vital importance to the students
on the, campus than a weekend vacation? Is the
problem of Natiol tlisln and the p 'ibility of all~
other world conflict too remote to ,ustify the con-
sideration of college students, Perhaps the stu-
Vdellt ln' ht ansu *r lightly, "\Vo might have been
able to ( o something about the vacation, but what‘s
the use of getting wrought up over smoothing over
which we can exert no influence?” Yet, if thillliillft'
students throughout the country adopt the attitude
that national affal s are, of vital concern. then who

Other Opinions

\‘ELL’S ll) EDITOR
(The Creightonian) ,

The editor of the Crimea student newspaper is dis-
couraged about the football situation at his school. It
seems that the Pioneers have lost six straight games
and the editor, in an editorial reprinted on this page, at-
tempts to explain why.

Grinnell‘s varsity squad is small, probably the
smallest in the Missouri Valley conference. The [resin
men players are even fewer in number, and the total en-
rollment of the school only about 550. How, the editor
asks. can his school he expected to have a winning team
under these conditions?

Reasonable as his argument seems, we find our-
selves out of sympathy with the editor from Grinnell. In
the first place, he has no need to find alibis for his foot—
ball team. The records this year show that most of the
Pioneel‘s’ games have been close. hard fought affairs;
rarely were coach Watts men outclassed. That they
lost has sometimes been due to the breaks, sometimes to
the superior team and the Grinnell editor was gracious
enough to concede that Creighton was one of those Sue
perior teams last Friday night. Yet the battle was very
cl so and might easily have been a victory for Grinnell.
The loss to brake by two touchdowns was not an over-
whelming defeat, Furthermore, Grinnell was not ex-
pected to produce a winning team this year as were sev-
eral other Valley schools.

We cannot agree with the Crinnell editor, Com-
pared to some of our problems at Creighton we believe
his are rather small. For example, he has a loyal and
responsive student body instead of an apathetic, lethar-
gie_ indifferent one.

That Creighton has won only half its games thus
far this year is, of course, disappointing, but is explained
by an injury jinx that removed the captain and stellar-
performer and in turn demoralized the team for half the
season, The breaks were undeniably against Mr. stark
and his cohorts.

Yet the games lost by Creighton to Kansas and
Drake and the tie With Haskell were not crushing oe-
feats; they are quite comparable with those of crmnell
where lack of reserves was an important factor.

We cannot concede the argument that the size of
the student body makes for a difference in the calibre of
Missouri Valley football teams. The comparatively large
enrollments of Washington, Creighton and Oklahoma
A. fe M. college can contribute little to the football
squad. Much of this enrollment is in the professional
aellools. Out of the “2,935 at Creighton university" only
about 1,000 or less’cau be included in arts colleges and
eim'lni schools from which football candidates can be
drawn. Creiglitoirs football squad has numbered about
so rice the beginning of the season; the freshman squad

* mewhat larger.

From our point of view it would seem that Grinncll
is clearly of valley calibre in football. It is not a top»
nolcher and probably will not be for several years but
there seems to he no reason to conclude that the Flo»
l'Oel'S' sun has set.
