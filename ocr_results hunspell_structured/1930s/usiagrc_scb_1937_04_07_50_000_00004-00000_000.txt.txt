A PROGRESSIVE STEP

(Editorial chairman's note: This is the fifth of a
series of editorials dealing with student government
in Gl‘inncll. It is the pohcy of the paper for all
editorials on student governmental questions to be
drawn up. approved and signed by the Editorial
Board of the Scarlet and Black.)

It is with a great deal of genuine satise
faction that the Scarlet alld Black congratu—
lates the president of tile Council of House
Presidents on appointing a special committee
to investigate possible changes ill the Grille
hell system of men’s government. Such a
move is plainly progressive, and it should
receive the united support of all dormitory
residents.

While the appointment of such a come
mittee has come rather late ill the school
year, the present dormitory council will be
able to lay the foundation work which is
necessary and essential in such a progressive
movement. The present council has begun
something worthwhile, and it would be well
for the new council which is soon to be
elected to continue such a policy. May we
suggest that such a committee be made
a permanent standing committee of the
Council of House Presidents, a committee
which would at all times examine the dore
mitory government structure with a critical
eye and attempt to improve it from time to
time as defects are revealed“.7

The colleges of Iowa and its neighboring
states offer a field of investigation for this
new committee. It lnigllt be helpful if this
committee were to inves ' to the types of
men‘s government atipel ldps Drake, Iowa
State, Creighton, Coe, Cornell, and others.
While we realize that the men’s government
in those schools is largely dominated by the
fraternity system, there is still room for a
study and a comparison of those systems
with that which we have here at Grinnell.
Material gained from such an investigation
should provide the committee with definite
ideas with which to work.

The council has already provided a sys-
tem of personnel officers in each halll This
move should prove valuable if the men
selected to fill the offices are capable, inter
ested, and willing.

The recent action of the Council of House
President's surely deserves and demands
commendation, and the Scarlet alld Black
again extends its congratulations to the
men’s governing body.

SUPPORT THE BAND l

Some time ago, the Scarlet and Black
published a series of editorials urging Grin-
hell students to support the college band.

Several weeks ago, the director of the
college hand, through the columns of this
paper, announced that plans were being
made to enlarge the band to all organization
of 60 pieces.

What was the response of the students
who play band instruments when they were
0 red a position in the college band? Some
persons took advantage of this opportunity
and joined the band, but for the most part,
however, the student body did not respond
and the results were far from gratifying.

It is only a matter of two months now
until school closes for the summer recess.
But there is time, nevertheless, for the
foundation of a strong musical organization
to be laid for next yea The Scarlet and
Black urges all college students who play
band instruments and who will be enrolled
in Grinnell again next fall, to join the band

and do theirpart in building and mailltaine
mg an organization of which Grinnell college

can be proud.

STATE SAFETY MEASURE DEFEATED

A bill was recently defeated ill the Iowa
House of Representatives which was design—
ed to consolidate the present state highway
patrol, the state bureau of investigation, the
state fire lnalshall‘s office, and hordes of
state chec els and inspectors now attached
to many 0 'ices in the state governmental
set-up. If the bill had been passed, the con-
solidation of these bureaus, commissions,
and offices would have been placed under a
general state department of public safety.

The bill which was introduced and sponr
sored by Dean W. Peisen, Eldol'a, Republic
can representative from Hardin county,
would have 'educed the state expenditures
by all appro imate $500,000 a yenl, it was
estimated. Besides the economy feature of
the bill, the measure would have eliminated
useless duplication ill the state enforcement
agencies.

The safety tlllit lneasul e was defeated by

vote The tie automatically defeat—
cd the bill for it lacked three votes of the
required 55 for passage.

Once again the old “line" which was
used by so many soecallcd progressives was
brought illto play. The cry of “wolf, wolf"
or “Wall street, Wall street"ithat the bill
was backed by the financial interestsiwas
used. Rep. Milton W. Strickler, Polk Re-
publican, branded. the bill as a "strike-break-
ing measure” and he urged that the House
“not be hood-winked by the clever subterv
fug'e of this bill." Mr, Strickler maintained
that the financial interests were back of the
bill and that it would create a state coll-
stabulnry.

Since 1914 successive interim committees
of successive s to Houses of Representa-
tives of succes ive state legislatures have
recommended a consolidation similar to that
which was recommended by the Poison
measure but once again nothing has been
done about it and the taxpayers continue to

pay.

new THREATS T0 FEMININE ALLURE
(Daily Trolan)

Sometime during the determination of “Does
This Foretcll a Nohler Race,” the question of col—
legiate apparel will most certainly be broached.
And when iL IS, if some male runs screaming down
the aisle demanding an explanation of the contra;
dictory status of the campus Women's garb, let not
the axe of censure fall upon him for yea and verily
it presentcth a problem to all males.

Granted that women achieve more solid com»
fort and chic in their apparel than men, why must
they be so careless of the little elements of dress
which strike the impressionable male with an illu-
sion-shattenug thud, and destroy the effects of the
other careitlllyeplottcd effects.

At one tune the hobby sock was the real mcnr
acc to a woman's nllulc, but that danger has long
since passed on the U.S.C. campus leaving in its
wake two defects in dress, even less aesoietic and
more disturbing.

They are: (1) Knecehigh hosiery; (2) the prac-
tice of pulling full-length sweater arms above the
elbow and allowing them to remain there indeflnr
itcly.

Correction of these slovenly and illogical hab-
its rests in restraint and the realization that the
knee and the elbow are not pinnacles of beauty and
therefore are not to he prominently displayed.

if the soul-lending urge to pull up your sleeves
seizes you frequently, why not confine yourself to
short-sleeved sweaters entirely and save yourselves
from appearing ready to scrub a lloor or butcher
cattle at any minute.

If economy and comfort recommend a “free-
dom or the knees" program, keep both feet firmly
on the ground at all times.

Only thus will you insure that the. effect of
“clinic” you spread so liberally on your race this
nlotnmg and of the smart ensemble isnot being
checkmoted by an item of desllabilleiperhaps a
peeking kncc or an exposed elbow.

“Football must be taken from the gamblers
and the Toll, rah boys' IL is of such significance
that it descrvcs to be taken back into the colleges
and universities as part and parcel of the ethics»
tional project." Dr. Ralph c. Hutchinson, president
ot Washington and Jeffcr n college, believes a
great football team is a detriment to a college.
