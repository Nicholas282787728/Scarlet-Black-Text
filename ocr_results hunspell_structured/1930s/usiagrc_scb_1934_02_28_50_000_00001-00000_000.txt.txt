Duke to Take 19 Entrants;
Drake Favored to Win
Saturday Evening

With 19 men journeying to Des
Moines Saturday for the first Mis-
souri valley indcor track meet to be
held in two years, the Pioneer track
squad is considered a- threat to win
the mile relay, the shot-put, and the
«MO-yard dash, and given a chance to
win second place in the conference
standings.

While Drake is favored to win the
meet, and Butler and Grinnell to
fight it out for second place, accord-
ing to Coach Lester Duke, predic-
tions may be upset by Washington
university of st. Louis, which is en-
tering the meet for the first time. If
Washington should prove strong
enough to take points away from
Drake, Butler would probably win the
meet, said Coach Duke.

Expect Fast Mlle

Oklahoma A. is M. is the only Val~
ley school which will not be repre-
sented.

Close competition in the mile race
is expected, with Sears of Butler,
holder of the Missouri valley outdoor
record, rated as favorite, and Thomp-
son of Drake and Pheiffer of Grinnell
possible winners, according to Coach
Duke.

Lack of a suitable place for prac-
tice for hurdlers, dash men, and
weight tosscrs will handicap the Pio-
nccrs in their preparation, since cold
weather will keep all workers in-
doors. Gordon Meeter, who won the
shot-put in the dual meet at Arms
Saturday, shows remarkable improve.

rying a foot and a half farther, but

Friday night will release Morgan, who
with Meeter and Rose, is entered in
the weight event, and Dick Mason,
who, in spite of lack of practice, wrll
compete in the broad jump and the
50-yard dash,

Preliminaries for the meet will ht-
gin at the Drake fieldhouse at 10:30
a m. Saturday, and will be held in the
quarter mile, half mile, and broad
jump. The main meet will begin at 8
o’clock Saturday evening, with the
pole vault star-ting at 7:30 p. in.

Iowa State Wins Duel
With Pioneers

Although out-scored by the large
Iowa State college track squad, 70
to 34, in a dual meet at Ames Sat-
urday, the Pioneer runners lived up
to pro-season expectations, taking
three first places, slamming the two-
milc run, and placing in all but two
events.

Making a clean sweep of thc pole
vault, due to lack of Pioneer entries,
and the broad jump, the Cyclones
piled up an impressive total of points,
though no outstanding performances
were turned in during the meet.
Phelffer, Grinnell milcr, completed
the distance in 4:31.1, only 1.2 sec-
onds over the Ames Iicldhousc re-
cord and was not pushed to win his
event, Mcnrath, of Grinnell, taking
Second.

Critic Praises, ‘Censures Productions
of Operetta, Play by Drama Department ‘ Miller President;

Satire, Ridicule Conyasted
in Sullivan, Moeller

Performances Here

(By n. w. MATLACK)

It has been the custom to take a
snooty attitude toward things that
happened during the fifty-year
reign of Queen Victoria, an era that
came to an end with the nineteenth
century. Last night the Crinncll
Players brought into sharp contrast,
in their program at the quadrangle
theatre, Victorian comedy and Broad-
way comedy. The honors go to the
Victorians.

For nearly 70 years “Box and
Cox” has been an indispensable musi-
cal sketch, a sure-fire hit. Manners,
customs, language even, have
changed enormously since 1867r but
"Box and Cox" without an iota of
change in book or presentation has
steadily gained in popularity. Tire
"fill do siecle" period, the imperial,
the pro-war, post-war, futurist, cub-
ist, and da-da ranges have come and
vanished, but this little old Victorian
comedy has something in it that is
timeless. Over against it the porno-
graphic smartness of Philip Moeﬂer‘s
“Pokey” is nothing but Broadway of
1931, already vanishing into innocu-
ous desuctudc.

Severe Test

To put anything whatever in the
same bill with a Sullivan piece is too
Severe a test. Perhaps that is why
the exhilaration aroused by “Box and
Cox" faded away into depression as
"Pokey" went on. In the first one,
gentle satire and caricature were
etched in music and text for fun, and
for fun only. In the other ridicule
was the motive, not fun, and it was
laid on with a shovel.

Sullivan and his librettist, Burnand,
who was Gilbert's forerunner, took
Wholesome common characters, plain
people, like the old sergeant admir-
ably portrayed by Dick Kuncl, a vet-
eran who never shot a gun but who
talked about war all the rest of his

lifei‘imd how his tribe has incl‘eased!‘

as newspaper man, and a journey-
man hatter. With an amazing gift
for tunefulness and for astonishing
musical puns on Handel, Schubert,
Mendelssohn, Donizctti, and a host of
other musical worthies, Sullivan took
three male characters, no chorus, and
mnrle a little musical play that is a

 

\

perpetual delight. It is no exaggera-
tion to say that the sun never sets
on "Box and Cox,” “Pinafol'e,” and
the "Mikado."

“Can Girls Be Good"

Philip Mocllcr, on the other hand,
turns a legendary character into a
nymphomaniac, a psychological de-
fective type that never exists among
Indians, and in putting contempor-
ary wisecracks into the mouths of
more or less historical personages he
does poorly what Shaw and Erskine
have done a lot better. The material
might have made a smart and funny
episode. It hardly goes beyond the
“Can Cirls Be Good" kind of stuff
that the Sunday papers print to catch
the dimes of the country boys.

Lots more might be said about
these two plays as works of art.
Sullivan's is; Mueller's isn't. Lots
can be said, too, about how well both
of them were given. “Box and Cox”
had snap and cleverness. It seems a
pity that Al Rose should have been so
devoted to outdoor exercisc through
his college years as to hide his ability
as a comedian and a singer under a
bushel.

‘Grinnell Interest in Europe Greater
Than in Many Places on Continent’

Sisley Huddleston Praises
International Knowledge

Here in Monitor Story

That “from Europe to Iowa is not
so for after all," is the conclusion
drawn by Sisley Huddleston, British
journalist and author, who spoke on
the Crinnell lecture course a month
ago, according to his article on the
editorial page of The Christian
Science Monitor last week.

Huddleston is the Monitor's Euro-
pean editorial correspondent, and
during his lecture tour has been writ-
ing his impressions of the United
States.

Favorably Impressed

The British writer was favorably
impressed with both his reception at
Crinncll and the interest of Crinnell
faculty members and students in
European affairs. He writes:

“To me Crinnell seemed so distant.
Grinnell, Iowa. I imagined that Eur-
opo would be just as distant from
Crinnell as Crinnell is from Europe.

“Not at all. I made my way there
in too easy stages. Easy stages that

wind up the aquatic season Saturday
in a dual meet with the University of
Nebraska in Lincoln. Neb., at 3:30
"p. in. Seven men will leave Crinncll
Friday morning and drive to Lincoln
for the fourth and last attempt this
semester to chalk up a win.

Davc Malhrough, John Bridgham,
Ralph Lane, nes Peterson, Nathan
strawn, William Taggart, and Charles
Whitmore are slated to make the trip,
according to Malbrough, and the
team will return Sunday.

The Nebraska tanksters defeated
Gustavus Adolphus, and although they
recently lost to the Iowa state swiur
mers by a score of 62 to 22, the Corn-
huskers are doped as the favorites,
especially since two Pioneer letter-
men, Tegct and Shephard, will not be
able to compete.

A return meet with the Newton y.
M. C. A. paddlers is scheduled for the
freshman natators in the Newton
pool Wednesday, March 7, at 7:30
p. m., but as yet the meet has not
been approved by the faculty.

Negotiations are also being made,
according to word from Malbrouglr,
for a freshman swimming meet with
the undefeated Fort Dodge High
school tank team, which is consid-
ered the leading pl-cp squad in thci
state thrs year. Plans for this mectl

Pioneer Five
to Meet Drake
in Final Game

Third’ Place in Conference
Goes to Team Winning

Friday's Contest

With a chancc to place third in
Missouri Valley conference basketball
standings, to end the valley race
with an average of .500, and to
avenge the defeat on the Des Moines
court Feb. 9, the Pioneers will bring
to a close their 1933-34 cage season
in a scrap with the Drake university
Bulldogs Friday evening, in the men's
gymnasium.

The game wrll begin at approxi—
mately 8 p, m., after a curtain raiser
between the varsity reserves and the
Mar-shalltown Junior college quintet,
the preliminary contest to begin at
5:40 p. m,

Ssnti, Mfmns Finish

Captain santi and Manna, veteran
guards, will play in their last game
for Crinnell college Friday.

Coach John c. Truesdale expects
to start Mason and Dlrphant at the
forward positions, Bauer at center.
and Santi and Manns at the guard
posts. Frye, DuMont and Morgan
arc likely to see action in the contest
also, although Frye broke his nose
again in the Creighton game and
has been wearing a guard in practice
this week.

Odds on Third or Fourth

Drake has just lost two conference
games, to Butler and Washington,
which leaves the Bulldogs even with
Crinnell in the standings, each having
won four Valley contests and lost
five. The Pioneers have a mathemat-
ical chance to finish either second,
third, fourth, or fifth in the Missouri
Valley race, according to the outcome
of the remaining games on the con-
forencc slate, but the odds on the
first and last mentioned places are
very slim for Crinncll.

If the Oklahoma Aggies should trip
Creighton in both of their contests,
and Grinnell should defeat Drake,
Coach Truesdelo's quintet would be
tied for second place honors with
Creighton. on the other extreme,
and equally as improbable, if Wash—
ington should humble Butler, then
Grinnell would be relegated to fifth
place, upon a loss to Drake.

Preliminary Game

However, the reasonable expecta—
tion is that Cr-innell will place either
third or fourth, depending on the
outcome of the Drake scrap Friday.

The preliminary game with the
Marshalltown Junior college quintet,
'ng to Tl‘uesdale, will give the
college fans a chance to See the tail-
endcrs of the varsity squad in action

Creighton Wins
With Ease

Creighton had no difficulty in dis-
posing of Grinllell in the second of
their two-game series Saturday we
ning at Omaha, Neb, the Blueiays
winning by a score of 46 to 26 ’

The Pioneers had difficulty in get—
ting possession of the ball, Schmidt.

and the Creighton forwards rushing
Grinnell guards so that passes were
hurried. ,

Ill addition, the Omaha
shooters were at their best, Sinking
long shots as well as setups, with
Schmidt and Englebretson leading the
attack. The former was the man who
really worried the Crinnell team, the
Creighton offense hinging upon his
key position,

Creighton led 21 to 11 at the half.
Mickey Frye, Pioneer forward, broke
his nose, first fractured in the Wash-
ington game, in the middle of the first
half of the game, and Julius Bauer,
center, was removed on personal fouls
with 10 minutes to play in the last
period.
