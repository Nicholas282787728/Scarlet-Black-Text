our Sweepstakes will take place
just a day before the annual

test of the high merit of our

the horses that are running. but
we have not been able to check
on this matter," he said.

back from last year. Abram

announced his intention of enter-
ing a dark horse, although he re»
fuses to divulge the nature of his
steed. other probable entrants
are Tracy Garrett, who also ran

 

last year; Buzz Blalul, a newcom»
er, Lynn Schlotterbeck, who rac—
ed in the finals last year; Bob

last year in the preliminaries;
