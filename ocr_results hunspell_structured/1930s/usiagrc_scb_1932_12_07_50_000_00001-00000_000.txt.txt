Report for Practice

Wentyrseven mcn reported to L.
L. Watt, freshman basketball coach,
Friday afternoon for the first fresh-
mnn practice of the season. A team
composed of DuMont and Lewis at
guards, Oliphsnt nt center, and Con-
ner and Boner at forwards was able
to outscore a Varsity quintet in is
short Scrimmage. Late practices have
lbeen devoted to fundamentals and to
scrimmagcs with the Varsity.

Outstanding Frosh ~

There are Several men on the
squad who are expected to boost the
basketball stock next year, Among
these is Harve Dllphant.o£ Vincen-
nps, Indians who has been working
out at both forward and center and
shows ability at handling the ball
and shooting baskets. Oliphant had
three years of basketball in high
school.

Harry DuMont, a Sophomore trans-
fer from Chicago U. has the most
deceptive pass of anyone on the
squad and has a good eye for the
basket from far out on the floor,
Next year DuMont should give the
guards competition since he is the
type of man needed for a fast, ac-
curnte passing team.

Ind, have Shown outstanding ability
at passig. They are Gail Lewis and
Gene Klepfer; Lewis has been playing

several times.

Randall Conner, former North Des
Moines stir and all-city choice for

Grinnell Educator Believes
Trend Will Continue,
‘Good or Bad'

“This is the age of specializing,"
said Dr. Edward A Steiner, profess-
or of applied christidnity, when in»
Lerviewed on the question of the
place of women in this modern world.

“Whether the fact that women are
specializing and going into business
is good or had, Whether We like it or
not, this Speclalizalon will Continue.
Woman is now becoming not only a
mother but also is person, just as
man long ago became not only a
father but also a business man."

Not Well Prepared

“The 'l'eSIllt is that she is probably
not well prcpared for either. Women
haven't as mlich chance of succeed-
ing in business as men have; this is”
due partly to custom."

As to Whether he thinks this trend
toward specialization is good, Dr.
Steiner said, "With every gain there
is a. loss \chan new has but will
lose the instinctive that man has al-
ready lost."

"Before this age of soecolled free»
dom her whole interest was
motherhood; now it is swinging rsp-
idly swny. However, children brought

Problem Not Careers

“The greatest problem in this con-
nection today is not concerning the
dangers of corcvers for women, The
danger comes when women treat as
serious the trivial things that aren't
really related to lifc. The purposes
lessness of considering bridge and
such pastimes important enough to
spend all their time on is appalling.
thn a woman has a Career, she
has a purpose in life and can do a
much better job of being it mothcr.
For example, Mrs. Franklin D. Roose-
velt has been a successful mother,
teacher, and woman in public life."
, ”I don’t know whether or not col-
'lcge can add anything helpful to the
solution of the present problem, One
of the hardest things to do is to pre-
pnre young people in college for the
responsibilities of parenthood.

"They don't take it seriously

on the other, they treat it as ridicn

an art is difficult to teach, espec-
lally in this day when standards of
art are rapidly changing and are not
set as they used to be."

“A new pattern will have to be
worked out for marriage, for the old
one is destroyed, When people are
lmarried, and both are working, cach
should live his individual life in his
particular sphere, yet both should fer
main together a profound spiritual
unit. Some of the happiest homes I
know of are homes where the woman
has a profession."

Various Reactions Noted As
Students Use Knife

First Time

BY A STAFF \VRITER

For some reason or other the sup-
ply of uLimbricus terrestris," which
in common billiard language is called
a fishin' worm, was insufficient this
season and Miss Blagg‘s budding
young bugologists were required to
be satisfied with pickled specimens.

Many female member of the
classes seemed slightly regusted when
the laboratory assignment called for
a dissection of the slimy creatures.
"It might not have been so had,"
some of them explained, “but we had
to cut them ourselves."

Primary Proceduro

The primary procedure was that of
figuring out which part of the earth-
worm was called the mouth, and why
it was placed at that particular end
instead of the other. The next step
was to slit thc animal six segments
from the clitellum, which means as
much to you, as to the beginning zo—
ologist.

Many “ohs,” “abs” and "poohs"
rent the laboratory atmosphere.
which was already putrid from the
fumes resulting from the experiments
of the chemists who delight in mix-
ing foul smelling concoctions for thc
edification of those one floor up.

 

Some ‘Oh’ , Others ‘Pooh’ as Biologists
rDissect Pickled ‘Limbricus Terrestris’

Bobby nonrly had a fainting spell and
Morgan thought very little of the
situation. Upon delving into the ans
otomy of the earthworm students
were rewarded by locating the sem-
inal mseptaclcs, cerebral ganglia,
coelem and septum . . . which gives
one a very dissipated feeling.
Keep Assistants Busy

Pete, "Snaps" and Shirley were
kept busy trotting back and forth
answering the numerous inquiries.
The latter would invariably find
something on the specimen that would
require her to congratulate the in-
nocent worker on the distinction of
the worm. Needless to soy the poor
worms had little to say about this
immodest prowling through their in—
testines and scratching around the
section that is said to contain their
brains, or brain. No doubt the worm
would have been very indignant at
the slurring remarks passing regard-
ing the size of his mental cavity.

Numerous members of the class
commented that they were “certainly
glad that they had eaten lightly
during the lunch," which cannot be
cntircly blamed on the laboratory
period, and added that never again
would they attend one of the Science
club’s dinners in the laboratory,

Three hours passcd rapidly and
sighs of completion rent the air; one
ly to have an assistant blithely res
mark, “on, but wait until you have
to dissect the Phylum yertcbrnto,"
Laboratory assistants will be used in
this experiment.

‘Disarmament’
Carson Topic

Tells Sunday Evening Club
Ways to Prevent Waur

Isabell Carson, senior student,
spoke on the question of ”Disarma-
ment” at the lust regular meeting of
the Sunday Evening club.

According to Miss Carson there are
two ways to prevent war. First, by
preparing fm war, and therein pre-
paring for peace; and second, by dis-
armament “If United States were
to prepare for peace by preparing
for war she would have to increase
the strength of her navy which is at
present a poor third to the unvies of
Japan and England."

Quotes Military Director

Miss Carson quoted Sir Frederick
Maurice, Director of Military Opera-
tions of the British General Stuff as
sayingi‘ﬁ thought at first that if
you would prepare for war you would
get peace, but I now thoroughly be-
lieve that if you prepare for War
you will get war."

In explaining disarmament, Miss
(‘ rsoll said that it was the gradual
imitation of armaments to mere

lpolice forces which could look after

problems within the country.
Reasons for Disarmament

"There are two reasons for (115*

armament First, it would realm thei

economic bur-den laid upon the poo—
ples of the world by excessive pres
pal‘allon for war, and second, di‘sv
armament would prevent competition
in preparation, from which war ro-
Stilts."

“Appropriations for the war den
pal-tment during the year 1932
amounted to 814 million dollars. If
disarmament were carried out, this
great expenditure in the depart
ments of the Army and Navy could
be materially decreased and the
money could be well used for other
purposes.“

Following Miss Carson's talk, on
open forum on the disarmament
question was held.

At the next meeting of the Sunday
Evening club, Manuel Brown will
talk on “Buddha, The Man Who Be-
Cdm-a God.”

Men’s Honor G Initiated 8
New Members Last Night

Eight new members were formal-
ly admitted into the Honor G club
last night in the first initiation held
by the club this year. One cross-
country man, six football letter Wine
ncrs, and e varsity manager were
awarded this distinction.

Those initiated were Robert Sut-
ton, Thomas Gordon, Robert Morgan,
Virgil Bawlby, Robert McMillin, Wes-
ley Clark, Clarence Smelser, and John
Wiley.

DISCUSS PLANS

Plans for the immediate future were
gone over at the meeting of the
League board with Pres. John Scholtc
Nollen in his office Saturday after-
noon.

All negotiations are being kept se<
orct at this time.

 

Cage Mentor
Cuts Pioneer
Squad to 15

Prepares for Opening Tilt
With Big Ten School
Saturday Night

Reducing his squad to 15 men,
Coach John C. Truesdale prepared for
strenuous practice sessions the rest
of the week Tuesday in anticipation
of a tough battle with the University
of Minnesota quintet Saturday night.

The Pioneer cagcrs will probably
get intensive scrimmage drills every
day until Saturday. Coach Ti-uesdale
will take ten or eleven men on the
trip to Minneapolis, leaving Grinnell
Friday evening and traveling by
automobile if weather permits.

to Survive Cut

Surviving the cut Tuesday were
Captain Duncan, Dick Mason, Arnold
Dickinson, Lewis Slye, and Bill Par-
zybok, forwards: Dick Phelps, Walt
Strnley, and Gil Collison, center:
Dick ulli-ich, Gaston Santi, Bob
Morgan, Paul McCully, Des Manns,
Lawrence Kayser, and Bob McMillin,
guards.

Truesdsle will probably pick his
starting lineup from eight men. Cap-
tain Duncan and Dick Mason are
fixtures in the forward well, while
Dick Phelps is almost certain to
start at center. Dick Ulln'ch has
been at one guard, while Gnston
Santi, Bub Morgan, and Paul MC»
Cully are waging a merry battle for
the other post. Wnlt Struley has been
used at center in the absence of
Phelps.

Scrimmage Frosh

Tuesday Coach Wntt sent his
freshman cogers against a second
string varsity lineup composed of
Straley, Dickinson, Pnrzybok, MCv
Cully, and Morgan. This quintet was
soon replaced by a first-string out»
fit, including Captain Duncan, Ma-
son, Phelps, Santi,,snd Ullrich., ,
Duncan, Ulli-ich, and Mason will
probably share the burden of the of—
fensive. The lanky Phelps at center
uses his height to advantagc in con-
trolling the tipoff, and is adept at
dropping the ball through the hoop
from close range, although rather
awkward in handling passes.

Duncan in Old Form

Captain Duncan has given every
indication that his lost season will
be his best, and has shown none of
the trouble in fdi ngihbetengir-z
the trouble in finding the basket that
bothered him at the start of last
season. '

An all-conference forward for two
years, Duncan is probably the best
ball-handler in the circuit, and his
accurate southpaw arm has kept him
near the top in the scoring race both
,lnst year and the year before. This
season he has shown an aptitude for
driving into the basket for set-up
shots, where before be relied more
on his judgment of distance from the
foul circle or therabouts.

Muson Bcst Sophomore

Dick Mason, the best of the soph-
omore candidates, has shown is will-
ingness to work into the complicated
Truesdsle system, and will be a vital
cog in the Pioneer machine. He is n
crack shot and a fine floor player.

Ullrich wins his backcourt position
'without question. He threatened
stardom last year, and this year,
forced to bear the brunt of the tier
fensive work with McCreory gone, he
will probably be outstanding.

Another New Rule

A special ruling passed by confer-
ence officials at the Indianapolis
meeting will benefit the Pioneer csg~
ers, as for as the execution of their
set plays is concerned. A new rule
will give the offensive team 47 feet
of space, one-half the maximum dis-
tance of 94 feet for a regular base
ketbnll floor. Thus the restraining
line will not be in the center of the
ﬂoor, but will be five feet back of the
middle on both sides. There will be
two lines, one for each team, each
five feet from the center. The Grins
hell and Oklahoma A Kc M floors are
the only ones affected by this change,
since all the other courts are max-
imum size,
