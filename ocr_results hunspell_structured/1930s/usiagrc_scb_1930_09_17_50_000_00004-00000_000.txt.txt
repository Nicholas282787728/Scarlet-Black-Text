Seven Letter
Men Back to
Support Jays

Only Four Positions Filled
on Creighton Line

by Veterans

(Special to The Scarlet rind Black)

OMAHAivviLLi only seven letter
men around which to build the 1930
edition of the Creighton Bluejay
grid squad coaches, Art Stark arid
Lon Gi-af, are burning midnight oil to
ﬁnd some solution to a difﬁcult prob-
lem.

Whether that solution will take the
form of an attempt at increased
strategy, a highly developed forward
passing attack, or the free use of.
scrappy sophomore material is not
yet known.

Line Suffers Heavily
The line Will suffer more than the

backﬁeld, as only four positions will ;

be ﬁlled on the forward wall by last
year's veterans. The backﬁeld situa—
tion is acute, however. in spite of
three returning letter men, and will
require swift as well as efﬁcient
work if the Jays ball lugging quar-
tet is to measure up to the standards
required by. the calibre of this year's
competition.

Co-Captains Rudy Tesar and
George Burger, tackle and guard,
respectively. will be back in the line-
irp, as will Ed Murray and Joe Hol»
land, guards, and Jack Furay, center.
Wee Willie Worthing, quarterback,
Ollie Scott, fullback, and Red Mc-
Conville, halfback, will bear the
brunt of the backﬁeld duties, probably
assisted by Kenneth Clancy, Harold
Crawford, Clare Dorwart, and Carl
Allison, reserves from last year, and
Eddie Jelen, sophomore flash.

Sophs to Fill Line

There is a possibility that Walter
Holden and Louis Rettenmaier, ends,
and Verle Holmes, tackle, letter men
from last year who have another year
of competition open, may return to
the Jay camp. It appears that the
open berths‘iu the line, however,

must be ﬁlled with sophomore and ;

reserve material. Heading the soplrs
are Gerald Dug-an and Carl Smith,
ends, Ed Wehr and Dick Skienar
tackles, and Louie Weiner, guard.

From the ranks of the reserves,
head Coach Art Stark may draft
'nlrk Tierney, tackle, or Jerry Davis,
quarterback. At all events, with the
limited material at hand and the hard
schedule lined up, it is going to re-
quire a lot of work and thought be
fore the Blneiay eleven takes form
in September.
