SATURDAY, JANUARY 28, 1933.

By Max Ross

Although Coach Bill Williams of
Drake has established quite a repu<
tation as a basketball prophet, per—
haps he places too much reliance in
his basis of comparative scores. He
announces that the Bulldogs will win
from Grinnell at Des Moines tonight.
and at the same time picks Butler to
win all three of its games on its
western invasion of the Valley loop.
Williams thinks that Grinncll holds
:. edge over the Aggies and will win
when the two teams meet at Grin-
nell February 2 and a.

Coach Truesdale thinks that the
Drake team is going to be a cracker»
jack outfit by the end of this year
or by the beginning of next. No won-
der! Coach Williams doesn't lose any
3: his stars by graduation, and will
have all of his regulars back for a

nucleus of next year's team.

We hope that the Drake»Grinnell
game tonight doesn’t generate into
the sort of affair that took place on
the Grinnell floor last year. The of:
ficial. Jack North, let the game get
completely out of his hands, and the
prodigious total of 41 fouls called
during the game represented only
about half of the infractions of the

rules that were committed.

Last year Grinnell won two out or
the three games with Drake,,taking
the first (a non-conference encounter)
at Des Moines 24-21, losing the sec-
ond 33-29 at Grinnell, and winning
the final one at Des Moines. 31-20. In
the game played on the Grinnell tloor,
the Pioneers missed a total of 19 free
throws to let Drake win.

Although scoring in Big six games
this year has increased by about 12
per cent. Coach Edwards of the Uni-
versity of Missouri proved that it
can be stopped when the Tigers
played the Jayhawks. coached by
Phog Allen, champion of the, new
plan. So efhective was his stalling
and so content were the Jayhawks to
let the Missouri team hold the ball
that the latter won by a remarkably
low score of 11 to 9, proving for Al-
len that his rule didn't work so well
in that particular case.

Professor Compromises;
Averts Strike, Sabotage

NEW YORK, (CNsl—Elinor Mar-
shall, age 17, learned about collective
bargaining in corwin D. Edwards
economics class at New York unie
versity.

She now boasts, with justifiable
pride, that she has been able to put
that knowledge to practical use, with
the result that she and other mem-
bers of the class now have to worry
about only six books of outside read-
ing, instead of 13.

Lead by Miss Marshall, the so stu
dents in the class served notice on
Professor Edwards that his collateral
reading chedule was too heavy, and
that unless he lightened it, he might
have a strike on his hands, with
picketing, sabotage and other strike
phenomenaiall of which had been
very carefully explained in Professor
Edwards’ lectures.

But the professor was willing to
discuss a compromise through col-
lective bargaining. so the six-book re-
quirement was decided upon.

Miss Marshall confidently expects
an "A” in the course.

strongest opposition to the Bliliken
title chances has been overcome in
part by the triumphs over washing-
ton and Missouri. One more game
with the Hilltoppers remains, how-
ever, before the city championship is
determined, and two games with
Rockhurst and one with the Missouri
miners stand in the path of glory for

to Apply Science

Committee Will Investigate
Production, Exchange;

No Technocrlaoy

NEW YORK, (CNS) 7 Following
closely the recent publication of a
comprehensive report by President
Hoover's research committee on soc-
ial trends, Columbia university’s
newly appointed commission for the
study of the economic situation will
go a step further in the application
of the scientific method to current
problems.

While the Hoover committee broads
ly analyzed all general social trends,
the commission of 17 appointed by
Pres. Nicholas Murray Butler of
Columbia \Vlll investinte a specific

change.

The commission, which is compos-
ed of seven Columbia faculty mem-
bers, four other prominent educators

inquiry: l

1. Analysis of the part played by
the price system in the direction of
production.

2. Analysis of the fluctuating re-
lationships of income, investment and
consumption within the present price
system.

3. Examination of pricecontrols to
maintain stability (a) of internal
prices, 07) of international exchange

5. Examination of economic conse-
quences of improvement in productive

6. Formulation of consequent poli-
cies.

chlmocrncy Left Out

Some comment was caused when
President Butler's announcement of
the formation of the commission fail-
ed to include any mention of Technoc~
racy, which is conducting industrial
researches with the cooperation of
Columbia's School of Engineering.

The desire for a distinctively
scholarly approach to economic prob-
lems was thought in some quarters
to have caused Technocracy to be ig-
nored, since the work of the Techno.
crats has been subject to many and
varied, as well as confused, interpre.
tations incident to the national pub-
licity it has received.

“The (new) inquiry,” according to
Dr. Butler. “will be directed in par
ticular to the technique of production
and the technique of exchange. which
.have evolved, not in interdependence.
but in semlrindependence each of the
other, with the result that they are
not now functioning in harmony for
the service of society.

Collect New Data

“The task will not so much involve
the collection of new data as it will
reflection on and interpretation of the

available to scholars.
“The aim of the commission will
be to arrive, it practicable, at a com—
mon viewpoint and a common inter--
pretation to the public of the mean
ing of the circumstances and condir
tions which confront the people of
the United states and the world."

Evanston Professor Calls
Holy Grail Story ‘Mylll’

EVANSTON, Ill.. (CNserr. A:-
thur c. L. Brown, English literature
professor at Northwestern university,
recently shattered another illusion
when he declared that the story of
Sir Galahad and the Holy Grail is
not Christian but pagan in origin.

After ten years of research. Dr.
Brown reported that the Grail legend
originated with the pagans, who
recognized in it man's quest for the
divine. He said he had traced the
"ancestry" of the Grail myth through
the Irish and Welsh to the form of
the story which connected the chaiace
with King arthur's court, the churac»
ter of Sir Galahad and the Christian
religion.
