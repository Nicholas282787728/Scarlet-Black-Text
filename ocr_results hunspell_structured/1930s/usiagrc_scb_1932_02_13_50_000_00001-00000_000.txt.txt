New President

Takes Grinnell
Helm Officially

Inaugural AddressTl—nursday,
“Function of College,”
Heard by Many

Two types of knowledge are neces-
sary to meet modern business condi—
tions, and it is the function of the col—
lege to furnish one type and the uni-
versity the other,
Scholte Nollen in his address Thurs—
day morning in Herrick chapel, before
students, faculty members and many
college and university educators at~
tending his inauguration as president
of Grinnell college.

The college, he said, provides the
type of scolarship that builds a “well
furnished mind, at home with a great
stock of knowledge. ideas and aware
ciaiions that serve as the strongest,
though subtlest, bond of social unity
between civilized men of every name
and age. The two characteristics of
such scholarship are. therefore. rich-
1y developed personality and high so-
cial competence."

University Linuted

The university, on the other hand,
which he said should confine itself
more strictly to graduate work, pro»
vides the learning necessary to do a
“very specific and limited piece of
work. Such a scholar may be likened
to the sharp point of a drill that is
making a definite and closely local-
ized attack upon a single spot in the
flinty wall of the unknown, The Chain
acteristic of such scholarship is com—
petence for and complete impersonal
devotion to a highly specialized task,"

President Nollen said that there is
no need for opposition between the
college and the university. The
American liberal arts college, such
as Grinnell, he believes, stimulates the
growth of the idea that students
should first get a broad, human, so-
cial education and then specialize,
In explaining the Grinnell plan, he

seven Fields

“The new liberal culture defines
seven fields which seem to us essene
tial to the equipment of an intelli-
gent member of society. These fields
are general science, or the history of
the physical universe; the history of
institutions, or the making of mod-
ern civilization; present problems of
citizenship in the United states:
world relations; literature; appreci-
ation of fine arts; and problems of
philosophy and religion."

Inaugural exercises Thursday morn-
ing were dignified and impressive. A
feature was the presence of repre-
sentatives of 125 educational institu-
tions. clad in brilliant academic robes.

The academic procession, marshal-
ed by E. B. ’1‘. Spencer, professor of
Greek, and headed by the senior class,
filed in at the beginning of the cere-
mony. Following invocation, greet-
ings were extended to President Nol-
len by H. S. Conard, professor of
botany, in behalf of the faculty, Lee
Alexander for “that peculiar group
known as the student body,” Dr. 0.
F. Parish for the alumni, and Harry
M. Gage, president of Coe college, for
the college presidents of Iowa,

President Nollen was presented by
the Rev. Charles E. Tower, Cedar
Rapids, member of the board of trus~
tees.

Life Scientific,
Religious Fight,
Says Niebuhr

Final Gates Lecture Given
Friday by Theologist
From New York

“Pious men appreciate the divine
God, while spiritual mcn appreciate
divinity beyond the immediate situe
ation,n said Reinhold Niebuhr, asso—
ciate professor of philosophy of res
ligion at Union Theological seminary,
in the fifth and final Gates Memorial
lecture Friday morning.

“Religion is the spirit of resigna»
tion to the inevitable. Life is only a
conflict between religion and science
which transmutes living into some»
thing glorious.”

Many Phases

Niebuhr explained that the contri-
butions of religion to man's social
problems embrace many phases

“Religion sees the potentialmnot

only what a man is, but what he
might be," explained Niebuhr. “Intern
preting the highest insights as not
one's own, but the will of God. The
ideal must he better than the facts,
but be associated with those facts."
Niebuhr pointed out that it is nec~
essary to establish social justice be—
fore Telglon is evident. He said that
the passion for social justice has re-
ligious roots, and religion has moral
roots.
“We have lost our sense of dignity
in man, Not until we establish hu-
man brotherhood again can we have
religion, The only chance of finding
God is to establish love and justice,
but we must have confidence in life
instead of despair,” concluded Nie»

Asceticism Discussed

in Fourth Lecture

Because of the fact that today's
generation does not possess enough
asceticism, it is not under, ethical
and social influence believes Reinhold
Niebuhr, who delivered the fourth
Gates Memorial lecture Thursday
evening.

In explaining the earlier crecds, the
speaker said that the monks of old
became impatient with this comprom—
ise in responsibility and withdrew
from the world so that they might
continue their practice of love and
Christianity,

Headwaiters Rate High, According

Popularity Contest

 

Headwsiters are popular—there is
no getting around the fact. Lee Alex—
ander, who holds that executive posi-
tion in the quadrangle dining room,
and George Van Nostrand, genial cap-
tain of the dormitory rlot squad.
prove the statement.

Both are included in the list of
Grinnell's five most popular college
men, according to the Cyclone pope
ularity poll, taken Tuesday by Flor-
ence Lewis, editor of the 1933 year-
book. The man and woman who are
ito be acclaimed the most popular
,studcnts in school will be announced
[in the publication.

Strolcy Versatile

As for athletics, Richard Ullrich,
basketball and football star, repre-
sents that major division in the list
of five popular men, Walter Sitmlcy,
‘mcmber of the cage squad, versatile
lactor and speaker, and member of
‘tne pep committee, enters the con-
test as an all-round activities man,

Another man whose activities are
ivaricd, is Fillmore Gwynne-Vaughan,
tennis team member, busin ss man—
,ager of tlic Cyclone, and president of
the Young Men's Christian associa-
tion.

other Aoti cs

In addition to being headwaiters,

Alexander and Van Nostrand repre-

 

sent other activities as well. The for-
mer’s speaking talents are well
known, and he is president of the
Grinnell student council. The latter
holds the position of treasurer of the
student council and represents the
vocal music department of the school
as well.

Despite altercations between err-
ing coeds and members of the Grin-
nell Women’s League board. all offi-
cers of the organization were includ-
cd in the list of Grinnell's five most
popular college women. Georgia
Murray, president; Helen Parzybok,
vice president, and Dorothy Alt,
treasurer, are popular officers.

Winncrs in Cyclone

Ruth Goodcnow, popular sousae
phone player and vocalist, and Katl'b
erinc Heywood, member of the Cy-
clone staff, former president of the
class of '33, represent other activi—
ties. In addition to lcsgue board ac-
tivit s, Helen Parzybok and Dorothy
Alt are housc chairmen of Cottages
Three and Five respectively.

In fact all school activities are
represented by the 10 lea‘ders. Which
proves foremost remains to be seen,
when announcement of Grinnell's
most popular man and woman is

With the four leading teams in the
Missouri valley conference in action
this weekend, sports critics are keeps
,ing their eyes sharpened for aileconr
‘ference prospects.

Cornic Collin, Creighton sophomore,
seems to have clinched a forward
berth but Duncan of Grinnell, Mautz
of Washington, Van Ackeren of
Creighton, Highfill of the Aggies,
and Smith of Drake are fighting for
the other scoring position.

The Creightoanasl-lington tilt last
night vi'uis supposed to show either
Schmidt or Maysack for the center
post. but, curiously enough they
played on even terms, each man score
mg seven points. Ley of the Aggies
is also being considered for the pivot
place.

Abram of Drake, Kiely of Creigh-
ton. Ullrich and McCreary of Grin-
nell, and “Baldy Herb” Stidemen of
Washington are leading the race for
guard berths.

With Washington playing Creigh-
ton last night. Drake tonight, and
Grinnell Monday night, experts will
have ample opportunity to judge
their men.

Yearlings Take 17-0 Lead

Early in Game

Steadily bar-raging the hoop with
baskets, the Grinnell freshman bas-
ketball team won its second victory
of the year over the Coe college year-
lings in a return game on th Grinnell
floor Friday afternoon, by a score
of 37 to 13.

The Libtle Pioneers piled up a com-
manding lead at the start of the game
and were never headed. The score
at halftime was 18 to 4,

It was 15 minutes after the start
of the game when the first Coe palm

OMAHA7Creighton university ca-

,Vallcy conference basketball title
ihel‘e Friday night by defeating Coach
lDon White’s Washington university
Bears, 26 to 21.

Led by Bob Maysack, veteran (lens
tor, the St, Louis team played a
brand of basketball which surprised
the Bluejays and had the score at a
Its—all tie at halftime,

Maysack and Schmidt, Creighton
center, each scored seven points.

Creighton now has only a slim
mathematical possibility of being tied
for the conference leadership by Grin-
nell. If the Bluejays should lose the

‘t of the conference games and the
Pioneers win, it would result in a tic
for the title.

 

Pioneers Need
Game to Keep
Second Place

Maysack, Mautz Lead Rush
of White’s Cagers

in Loop Race

Led by hotrshouting center, Bob
Maysack, who has suddenly hit his
last season's form after failing to
find the hoop in early games this
year, Washington university will in-
vade Grinnell Monday night in an
effort to reacli striking distance of
second place in conference standings.

coach Don White's Bears rounded
into shape slowly this season, but are
now in third place in the Missouri
Valley conference and, if they should
trim Drake university at Des Moines
tonight, they may tie with Grin-
nell for second. They hold a decision
over the St. Louis university Billi-
kcns who registered a 32722 win over
Grinnell this year.

Pushes Duncan

Grinnell cagers took a 36-22 mar-
gin over the Bears at St. Louis with
Frye, Duncan, and Rowe hitting the
basket in top style. At that time,
Mautz, Bear forward, was the only
Washington threat, Maysack failing
to get a point. The center is now in
sixth place in conference scoring
standings, however, and is pushing
for Duncan's third place ranking.

coach John c. Truesdole‘s Pioneers
will rest over the weekend after their
strenuous tilts with Marquette and
Coe, and Shouldrbe in top shape as
they resume their Missouri Valley
conquest. The Grinnell mentor will
start his usual lineup with Frye and
Duncan at forwards, Rowe at center,
and Ullrich and McCreary at guards.

Eamon Speeds Up

While Washington has been com-
ing up, Grinnell hasn’t been standing
still. and the impioved showing of
Edman, veteran center, against Mar-
quette and Coe was one of the fea-
tures of this week. He is setting a
faster pace and if he maintains it
will add materially to the Pioneer re-
serve strength.

Christoffersen played a good game
in the tilt here last night, and the all-
around play of the entire Grinnell
five is a cleaner and smoother brand
of basketball.

FryE’s Late Coal
Downs C ae, 28-27

Mickey Frye, slim sophomore for—
ward, romped away with the honors
in the Coe»Grinnell basketball game
last night, slipping a field goal
through the hoop in the final 10 Sec—
onds of play to give the local fans a
28-27 victory.

It wasn't a one-man tilt by any
means, however, and it was only by
some crafty planning on the part of
the Pioneers that they finally man-
aged to snatch the wreath of victory.
The game wasn't a repet' ion of the
contest on the Coe floor, where Grin—
nell trailed all the way to the final
minute, but it showed the same score.
and was won in the closing seconds.

Duncan scans

Duncan showed the Pioneers the
way early in the game with a tip ‘1:
shot and McCreary and Ullrich
brought Grinnell to a 5-0 lead before
Neary started Coe's scoring with a
charity toss. Grinnell led through-
out the fiist half, although a goal and
free throw by Faris, followed by a
field shot by Good tied the count at
Hall late in the period. Frye brought
Grinnell to a 14—12 advantage at halts
time with a goal.

Coe Takes Lead

Duncan and Ullrich put the Pio-
neers well to the front as the second
period opened, but when it was half
over, Faris led coe to threatening
distance with a goal and a free throw.
Good put the visitors in the lead for
the first time, 19 to 18, when he
dribbled through the Grinnell (lee
fense to score. Beiknap's toss from
far out a moment later was good.

Using a fast break down the side.
the Kobawk cagers reached a 25-20
lead with five minutes to play, but
Edman, McCreary, and Duncan flick—
