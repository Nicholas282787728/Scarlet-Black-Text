Why is all expanse of feliiilline hack bordered
by pique 01' scersuelter immodest, when a horder of
silk crepe or crepe dc chine brings the Sallie object
within the bounds of decency? There is no apparent
explanation; hut Surely there lnust be one, or why
the recent decree forbidding sun-hack dresses on
the Grilulell dmpus‘.’

The ruling declares tllat a style of tires which
is considered perfectly modest and attrac ve on
tllc dance floor is to be condemned as immodest if
worn on the campus. At a school which provides it
special smoking room for its coeds and allgl 'thclu
12 o’clock hours on dance nights, suCh a puritanical
rcgmllation appears not a little ridiculous.

Instead of a normal, commonly accepted sports
costulnc which has held a place ill the coed‘s wards
robe for the past two or three years, the illstizators
of the new ruling would apparently have one be
lievc that the informal loiltbaeketl dress is an ill-
velltion of the devil and that only a “hussy” would
be seen ill one,

The average Grinncll coed is completely capae
ble of judging what attire is ill good taste and
within the bounds of modesty. To forbid her the
right to exercise this judgment is but to invite defi-
once.

ARMS EMBARGOES FOR PEACE

War still rages between Bolivia and Paraguay
ill-the disputed Chaco territory. Despite the at
tempts of various countries and the League of Na-
tions to stop the conflict, it still continues unabat-
ed. The investigating committee for the League of
Nations, after considering the points of contro-
versy, recommended that an arms embargo be de»
clared against the two belligerent countries.

This recomlnllcdation was made for two rea»
sons. First, it would lie all effective means of
stopping the destruction of life and property, since
the warring nations have neither the means nor the
facilities for supplying themselves with the llt‘Ct‘Se
sary war materials. Second, there . good reason
to believe that the war is being continued at the l\lr
stigation of the world lllullitioll manufacturers, As
ill the past they are reaping a harvest of “blood
money,” for every shell fired means dividends to

. them.

‘Of course the lnullitiou manufacturers are op-

' ally attempt to enforce an arms en go,

a result the various governments of the

world are “ traddlillg the fem-e” fearing the illu-

ultion lolll - on one hand and the pos, ' )ilit)‘ ol'

aroused public opinion on the other. A proposal rm-

ou arms embargo uas luadc la' year. but vcl qulr

etly the matter was tabled. A 'hrewd guess would

place the credit for this effort '0 lilot'ltlllg of the

embargo proposal at the door of the \\'Ollll llllllllr

‘ tion makers, for it s common knowledge that they

V are very closely dllicd and are well organized polls
tit-ally to car ' on their nefarious traffic.

It is hi ll time, then, that the people of the
world real ., that the munitiou makers are one of
the greatest handicaps to world peace.

It is time that public opinion forces tllc goveruv
nionts to ackliolvlcdgo the fact that there is no jus-
tiﬁcation for traffic in arms, and that ill case of

war on arms elilburgo should be employed against
the belligerent nations to force, them to return to
sanity. Public opinion should demand use of the
arms embargo not only as a means of stopping the
Chueo “airfare but as a means of stopping future
u-ars as well.

THE ENE GREATEST MEN

(The Minnesota Daily)

With a retreshing disregard for traditional heroes,
the senior class of the City College of New York City
recently elected Aristotle, Christ, Leonardo da Vinci,
Karl Marx, and Albert Einstein as the five greatest men
of history. What a start this must ive the pious grade
school and high school teachers of ci ics, ancient history,
aud American history. There is not a sign of Caesar, Na-
poleon. George Washington, or Herbert Hoover. Hours
spent in memorizing the Roman emperors. names and
dates of European battles and their leaders, American
presidenu and their accomplishments—van seem to have
had little effect.

only one of those ”five greatest" is mentioned more
than casually during the first 12 years of schooling.
There is no time for a philosopher, an artist, a revolu-
tionary economic philosopher, or a long-haired mathemar
tieian. Rulers and generals must come first.

Of course, the New York seniors may be all wrong
and their five choices of little importance. On the other
hand, it is more likely that they see things pretty clear-
ly and in true perspective, for they have evidently re-
covered from the spoon-fed hokum of their earlier days.

MAEDCHEN IN UNIFORM

(Collunhia Spectator)

Coeaucation has long been a thorn in the side of
the manly Nazis. So, with a startling vigor which has
characterized their rapid backward march from civiliza-
tion, they have struck a smashing blow at this institur
Lion. They have abolished it entirely in the higher
schools of Prussia.

In 15 months German fascism has been ahle to wipe
out the work of 150 years. Over night it has upset the
entire structure or women's rights which feminists the
world over strove so laboriously to erect. Hitler has sent
the women of the Third Reich hack to the old Kurche.
Kuehe and Kunrler of the Hohenzolleran dynasty.

The women of Germany are to devote themselves
exclusively to raising Nazi cannon fodder They are to
be the mothers of a new generation of soldiers who must
die for the mad schemes of fascist militarism.

The task of releasing German women from their
medieval bondage will have to he done over again. Eas-
cist reaction is turning back the pages of history as
Hitler marches proudly into the darkness.
