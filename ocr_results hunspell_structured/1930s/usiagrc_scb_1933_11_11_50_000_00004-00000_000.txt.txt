Four Missouri Valley conference

and Gordon, of Creighton, who last
year led the Valley scorers. made
his first touchdown of the season
in the game with the Washington
team last week. Rhflorly, another
Drake player, and Jones, Creighton,
are tied for second scoring honors
in the conference.

It seems quite probable that the
powerful team from Oklahoma will
be strong enough to give the Drake
team its first conference upset. The
Cowboys made an impressive Shows
ing last week when they defeated
Tulsa’s Golden Hurricane by a 7 to
0 score, to keep a five year record
unblemished. The southern team has
only two valley games this season,
and it would be quite ironical if they
should ruin the Bulldogs chanccs
with these games. Last week Drake
displayed its best offensive power of
the year, and almost caught Pop
Warner's Temple aggregation nap-
ping, but finally came out on the
luke-warm end of a hot battle, that
ended 20 to 14.

Pete Wendell, Creighton's nation—
a.lly known swimming coach, died
last Thursday afternoon as a result
of a selfninﬂicied gunshot wound.

‘Curh, Control
Nations,’ Says

Stoddard Lane,

FArl-nistice Speaker Charges

Nationalism With Danger,
Stupidity, Bad Taste

“Unless nationalism is curbed and
controlledit will inevitably bring on
another world catastroph the Rev
Stoddard Lane declared in an Armis-
tice Day address at the allecollege
convocation in Herrick chapel Friday
morning

The'Rev. Mr, Lane, who was a
sergeant in the United States ambu-
lance service for two years during
the World war, received the French
Crolx de Guerre in 1918 At present
he is pastor of Plymouth Congregar
tional church, Des Moines, and a
trustee of Griiinell college

Three Counts

Blaming nationalism as one of the
primary causes of present worldwide
conditions, Lane declared that nations
alism is stupid, dangerous. and in bad
taste,

“Cultural and economic interddv
pendence make isolation an imp055r
ible dream," Lane said in comment

-ing upon the “Stupidity" of attempts

of nations to work out their prohr
lcms without considering the prob-
lems of other countries.

one System

“Distress anywhere is distr .
everywhere." he continued. “The
world is one economic system, and
until it works together there will be
chaos.“

Failure of disarmament and eco—
nomic conferences, the rapid increase
in armaments, and the rise of Hitler-
isni were cited as illustrations of the
dangers of nationalism.

‘No Right Inlpossiblc‘

“Nationalism defies the fundamellv
tnl principles of religion and cuts
across the moral principles of the
universe,” Lane added.

Expressing hope for the future,
Lane stated that present conditions
are dangerous but not hopeless, and
that war and nationalism are not in—
evitable. “When men work with God.
no wrong is inevitable, no right im-
possible," he concluded.

James Meyers and Howard Whit-
ney returned Friday to their homes
in Des Moines with the Rev. Stoddard
Lane who delivered the address in
Herrick chapel Friday morning.

Mrs, J. 3. Light and son J, Hatten
Light, accompanied by Mrs, viva

‘Beer, Refreshing Drink for Gridders

Says St. Louis Coach

and be temperate about it." Coach
Walsh told his squad, in csplnining
his stand on 3,2 as regards football.
Walsh said that doctois prescribe
beer as a tonic, and since its alco-
hollc content is so negligible. it saw
es only as a cool and appetizing
drink for football men after a hard
game or workout
Gives Noon Lectures

Naturally, the use of hard liquors
is ftll‘hiddvn by the Billikcn training
rrilcs. As for smoking, Coach Walsh
disapproves or it, but like any other
grid mentor in the country, knows
that some of his athletes indulge in
a cigaret now and then

Among other requirements on the
St, Louis U. training schedule are a
30Aminute lecture every noon, an
hour and a half of practice daily in
the afternoon] and a half-hour drill
once or twice a week at night.

Coach Walsh, a former Notrc
Dame end under the late Knute K.
Rockne. is in his fifth season as St,
Louis U. coach He is a brother of
Adam Walsh, former Notrc Dame
grid captain, who piloted the famous
Four Horsemen eleven.
