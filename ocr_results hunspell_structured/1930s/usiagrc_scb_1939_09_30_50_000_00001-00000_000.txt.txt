‘Why Students Choose Grinnell?’
Draws Many Different Answers

“Why did You come to Grinnell?"
If you're an old and settled up—
pcrclassman, you probably dllln't
have that question flung at you.
And if you did, you would have
said. “That's what I'd like to
know!” Not so the preps and
trans[el's. They've got, as the
saying goes, their reasons.

Due to the difficulty of making
connections with the registrar’s
office, your inquiring reporter is
in some doubt as to the exact
number of new students on cam»
pus. But there ain't no doubt
that they’ve arrived. Is there?
They've cvcn arrived at the point
where they can answer such a
dumb question with a certain de-
gree of eqllanlmity.

Take Dale Cunard. She came
because she wanted to be a chip.
Her dad (and we don't mean the
chairman of faculty) was once a
student here. Walter Morris
started out by saying he wanted
to go somewhere else, but rc-
versed the field and decided that
hc cnmc because lle’s gotta lotto
friends here.

And Boyd Kennefick enrolled
partly for the experience of stag-

 

ing a brother act with “Moose",i

and partly because ”it's a swell
place.” Imagine hcr surprise.
saul Betty Pallipel‘ien, when she
discovered she just wasn’t the
domestic type. So she headed
for Grinnell, where there is,
among other things, no home ec.
course. So much for the preps.

Now comes the transfers, Dore
othy Young, who'd like to be
known as Bunny, thank you,
found when she reached her sen-
ior year that she couldn't stand
Appleton, Wis, any longer. So
now she’s a senior at Gtinneli.
We didn't want to interrupt the
guy‘s study to ask him, but we
strongly suspect that Jack Keehn
DIDN’T come to Grinnell to be
reminded of his famous brother.
And it’s a cinch that if Wall
put his customary heart into his
work. what else could friend
Wigdahl do BUT come to Grin-
nell?

(Eileen Engcl, who is NOT a
new student, said she came to
Grinncll because she heard that
the distribution of men and wo-
men was equal. only to have this
opinion rudely refuted by the
registrar, What price varsity
ticket?)

By Thom Kuhl.
Grinncll college inauspiciously
made its home debut in the Mid-
west conference by absorbing a
14 to o defeat at the hands of
the Carleton college, Carls, last
night.

For three quarters, the two
teams battled on even terms, but
in the final period Richard Rait-
er, outstanding Carleton halfback,
ran through the Pioneers for two
touchdowns and kicked both ex-
tra points to personally stop the
scarlet and black warriors from
winning their second Midwest con-
fcrencc game.
