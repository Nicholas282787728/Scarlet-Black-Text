TO LADIES OF THE COURT

Last week a disgruntled freshman handed in
a written complaint against the tradition, as she
said, denying women the use of the tennis courts
on Sunday. Such} a tradition, she pointed out,
was completely inconsistent with the liberal atti-
tude which Grinnell claims for itself upon such
matters.

Before openly criticizing the matter in these
pages, its authenticity was investigated, with the
result that no such tradition was iouncl to exist.

So prevalent was acceptance of the non-exists
ent rule, however, ﬂlat even the president of the
VVomen’s Self Government league was convinced
that it existed and at least one cottage chairman
had urged its observance upon the residents in
her building. Moreover, the general impression
throughout the quadrangle seemed to be that such
a regulation was in effect.

Grinnell coeds are not usually so retiring as
to silently observe unpleasant restrictions without
assuring themselves of their authenticity, but
either this case was the exception or else they had
never been given cause to doubt the existence of
the Sunday tennis tradition.

Whatever the cause of the misunderstanding
—whether it arose from misinterpretation oi an
announcement, or through failure to make public
a change in an old regulation, or through mere
negligence of the women to investigate the matter
for themselves—We wish to put the ladies oi the
court straight. Tennis IS permitted on Sunday,
except during church and Vesper hours. This ser-
vice is free.

IN MEMORIUM

What has become of the Lantern? For two or
three years this organization, which is potentially
one of the most powerful on the campus, has been
slowly dying.

Last year the group had at least one meet—
ing, for officers were elected. With that effort com-
pleted, however, it apparently curled up and died.

It is a pity that the Lantern has not taken
advantage of its opportunity to become a real force
on the campus. Granted that its members, the
heads of men’s organizations at Grinnell, are all
busy with other activities. A weekly meeting,
however, would be of very little inconvenience to
them.

By merely iunctioning us an advisory council
on current student questions they could be of a
genuine value to the campus. During each school
year one or two very worthwhile student projects,
which should -by all means be undertaken, are
abandoned through lack of general enthusiasm,
With an influential organization, such as the Lan-
tern might be, backing these projects, at least a
share of them might be followed up.

It is up to the present members of the Lantern
society to decide whether the organization is to
disband or reorganize. They can make their group
a vital force in campus life or permit ”the Lan-
tcrn” to remain an empty meaningless title—as
they choose.

JUST ANOTHER YEAR?

In a strange and almost awc-inspiring way the
things most fundamental in human life scem to
go on unchanged through the ages. We feel it
with George Eliot when She paints a picture of
a Roman dawn ill ll. ory ol Romola. The
some sun, rising as it has risen for centuries, sees
”nearly the same outline of firm land and unstable
sea', the same mountain shadows on the same
valleys, domes and spires of cities rising in
the same spots” Where they rose a thousand
years ago, “The great river courses, which have
shaped the lives ol- men, have hardly changed,”
while the same joys and sorrows, happiness and
pain has filled the hearts of men for eons. The
long circle of life endlessly rcpcrits itstll, ...
hunger and labor, seed-time and harvest, love and
death.

To be sure, there is a dull sameness about life,
and the children who played in the squalid hut or

T-IIE. GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

cave of the savage may have been neither happier
nor sadder than the children of Grinnell. Yet they
were very different children, none the less. And
so was the world they lived in. Even the rivers
shift their courses, and the “changelcss” ocean
once covered the fields our Iowa farmers till to-
day. Nothing in nature is really changeless, and
man is very much a part of nature.

As a new Grinncll year settles down, there is
much that Seems like repetition. Different faces,
to be sure, but just another class as every year
has produced them for decades. Yet it is “just
another class”? And is it true that this year must
he a dull rape ition of many like it in the past?
If we will, we can begin today in the building
of a stronger and better Grinnell. Large numbers
and full halls have given an enthusiasm which
we can keep alive if we will. The football team
came back from Michigan with a strong showing
to its credit; it can continue it we support it, Morn—
ing chapels have been successful, and their seats
have been full; their value can continue if we give
our support. A new tennis team has grown to fill a
vacancy left two years ago, In a hundred ways,
new possibilities are in the air, but they are only
possibilities; it is for us to make them realities.

Other Opinions

FRESIIMAN CAPS
(Daily Northwectorn)

Another college tradition has bitten the dust. At
Michigan freshman caps have gone their way, and hence,
forth freshmen will be allowed to go about bareheaded
in the true collegiate fashion. .

We have olten wondered as to just the proper use
for these cute green pieces oi apparel. it is true that
they are used ‘ns iuel tor a big iire, but that is in the
spring when the weather is getting too warm for arti»
tieial heat It may be argued that these hats are used
to distinguish the freshman lrom the other species of
college students, but in our experience we have tound
the irosh readily distinguishable by a certain expression
on the taco, so the hats lose their usetulness in that line
also,

The hats may be used to lend splashes of green to
soften the drabness of the winter’s grey, but they are
often tilted at such an angle that one would either have
to fly or crawl along the ground to see anything of the
coloring matter. They are very poor for use in
warding oil colds. Some people must wear a hot in win.
ter, or suitor [or it, and the ireshrncn hats, like Russia,
cover about onc»cighth of the total surface.

It is evident that Michigan had this serious problem,
and Paced it squarely by eliminating the hats through a
natural process; they let the fresh decide for themselves.

APPLE POLISHING
(Golden Grater)

We have been familiar with the words "apple—polish—
ing" and the hypocrisy that is characteristic of it. We
condemn the person who is guilty of the practice; we
laugh and sneer at him, and mock him and feel that he
deserves the derision. It has become so mechanical and
so much a part ot our subconscious selves to deride the
offenders that we are often unjust and condemn the
student who IS but interested and eager.

Must a person who is among the first to volunteer
aid to a ieculty member in extracurricular work be brand-
ed an "appleepolisbert" It is hardly teir to pronounce
guilty the interested student who remains questioning
his instructor a few moments otter class is dismissed to
learn more of an engrossing subject.

Again, the student who does just a little more work
than is required of him is also misiudged. Initiative, it
would seem, is definitely uboo among the students. it
is exceedingly narrowwninded to think always in terms
oi "appleepolishingr It is not only possible, but most
likely, that there are some people, tew perhaps, who,
when they act in ways memtioned above, have in their
minds other motives than to be forever adding a shine to
the apple.

CHANGE OF STANDARDS
(Daily Northwestern)

The standards for the award of Phi Beta Kappa are
changing. Dr. William A. shimer, secretary of the or.
ganization, declared in his report that chapters are using
criteria of scholarship other than "the accumulation of
course grads: marks."

The Carnegie report indirectly gave Phi Beta Kappa
a sub in the back. The report disclosed that the student
who topped the entire list of 2,300 proved to be a boy
who, except for one high mark in history, had failed mis-
erany 01' received "D’s" in the rest of his course for
three years, and had actually been demoted from the
junior to the sophomore class; whereas in another college
a young woman about to receive a “magna cum laude"
failed the tests, standing filth from the bottom in a class
of 48 and in the lowest 10 per cent for the state.

oi course this is no doubt an extreme example. How-
ever, it is an established fact that grades are not an ab-
solute crileria of one’s intellectual advancement.

According to Dr. Shimer, Phi Beta Kappa is adjust.-
ing itselt to a degree to this condition. He listed as crit—
cria how considered other than grades as “broad honors
work, comprehensive examinations, the accumulative re—
cord, and subjective estimates by tutors and teachers.”
He cited also the present practice of Harvard chapter
in “postponing more elections to the end ot the year
when the results of honors work and comprehensive ex—
aminations can be considered.”

CHAPEL
NOTES

This week, Cecil r. Lav-211, protess
or of the history of thought, defined
the “eternal things in terms oi today".
He explained that a dog differs from a
man because it is incapable of bone-
fitting by the cxpel‘ience of his force
bears, thus making his wisdom indir
vidunl; whereas, according to Bacon,
“the past is the servant of the future"
lor man,

on Tuesday Professor Laveli contin-
ued by explaining the significance and
meaning of the Greek word "aidos"
or reverence. He quoted a saying of
the Greeks; “you must walk humbly
and delicately to propitinte the totes,"
in other words, he pointed out, we
need what the Hebrews called ”fear
of the Lord", and what we call “trust
in God."

Horacc’s hymn “Integer Vitae” was

the text for Wednesday‘s talk. The
Romeo, explained Mir. Lavell, laid
stress on “trust in himself.” In order
to trust in oneself, however, one must
purge oneself of everything that
doesn’t belong, so that "holiness is
purity, and. purity wholesomeness," the
speaker asserted.
In. his concluding talk, Thursday,
Profesor Lovell advised that one
should draw on the experience or
others, should reverence things greater
than themselves, and keep a sound
mind and a wholesome body.

All Halls Plan to Enter
Intramural Cross Country

Advance indications point to repre—
sentation from every hall in intramur—
al cross country this year, according
to Tom Gordon, student manager. This
is an advance irom the poor showing
oi some oi the halls in last years
meet, he noted.

According to Gordon, there are sev—
eral very promising harricrs on the
freshman squad. Don Smith, Dibble,
Gaylord Doisback, Pioneer hall, and
Richard Peavey, Smith haLl, he named
as outstanding. These men are not
the only good prospects on the team,
he explained, but due to previous ex»
perience they are developing more
rapidly.

Gordon stated inrther that parti—
cipation in cross country provides a
chance for all new men to win their
class numerals.

The varsity cross counuy team has
been working not regularly. The
candidates are developing test, Gor~
don declared, though some oi the men
have been hampered by conﬂicting
outside acu'vities.
