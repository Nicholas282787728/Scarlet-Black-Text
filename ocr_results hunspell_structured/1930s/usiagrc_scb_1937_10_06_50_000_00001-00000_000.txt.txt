New Grade
Plan in Force

System Expected to Put

Grading on More Equal ‘

Basis for Students

The new grading system, come .

puted on a percentage hasis,
which was adopted last spring hy
the faculty, will go into effect
with the present semester, the
president's office announced to-
day.

The purpose of the new system
is to make the grades more def-
initely representative of the quali.
ty of work than the old ArBrC
grades.

The new plan is expected to put
grading on a more equal basis for
both superior and average stu-
dents, making it possihle for the
teaching staff to administer grades
with more uniform results than
have appeared in the past.

The percentages apply only to
students receiving passing grades.
compared with the system used
previously, the honor grade cor-
responds to a high A; the superior
grade to a lower A and a high B:
and the basic grade to a low B
and a high 0.

Tabulation of the new grades,
grade points and distribution is as
follows:

Deserip< Grade Recommended

H Honor 4 5%
S Superior 3 25%
