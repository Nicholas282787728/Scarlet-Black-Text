SWIMMERS‘ TAG DAYS.

The coming Friday and Saturday have been ans
nounced as tag days for the benent of the varsity swim—
ming squad. It is hoped that by the drive conducted in
these two days enough money will be secured to ﬁt the
varsity mermen with new swimming suits of an im—
proved type as well as other equipment essential to an
aquatic squad.

_It_will be a decided encouragement to Grinnell
athletics these two tag days turn out successfully.
The attainment of the quota set by the swimming de—

partment will mean enough money for equipment to
assure that Grinncll swimmers can compete under the
most favorable conditions possible. Most of the money
secured as a. result of the drive will be expended on silk
swimming suits considerably lighter than those in use
last year.

A 'lighter swimming suit means the possibili-
ty of cutting down a fraction of a second on racing time
in the shorter distances and may mean the dcduction of
several seconds from the racers’ time in the longer dis»
tences. This may mean the difference of several points
in a meet, and naturally it is to the interest of all Grim
nell to see that any one of her teams makes a respect-
rtole showing in competition.

A less tangible but none the less important value of
a successful swimming drive will be that it should bolst»
er up the morale of the team. AS swimming is a com~
paratively recent sport at Grinnell, and is going through
the difficulties which usually encounter a sport in its
introductory stages, the manifestation of student sup-
port is necessary to establish the sport ﬁrmly in the

roster of Grinnell intercollegiate athletics.

Tl-ns YEAR'S PRUDlTLES,

Today the announcement is made that the Pioneer
Prudlties are to be staged for the third time. To
those who have attended the production the past two
years, this means, on the whole, a pleasurable event to
look forward to. The Prudities are staged with the
purposes of bringing out the latent originality in stu-
dent writers and humorists at Grinnell and of increas-
ing the’ cooperation between men and women on the
campus. With such purposes, the all-college revue de»
serves the support of every student. It is the test of
whether the student body can really write and pro-
duce something original and clever.

But because a large portion of -Lhe student body has
not given the Prudities whole-hearted support in the
past two years, that is, support in helping to put them
on, the purposes of the Prudlties have not been fulﬁlled
as they can be. There is no need to hide the fact that
while some of the acts presented last year were clever
and showed evidence of much time put in on them and
of originality, some were exceedingly dull and ﬂat, and
presented with obvious lack of practice. Why? Mhiur
ly because some acts inculcated the best talent available
ends spirit of cooperation on the part of the individual
members of the demo and cottage, while in other build-
ings and cottages little was done until a few days be-
fore the pre-vlew, and then not much.

So extensive was the criticism of the manner in
which many of the acts were produced last year. and
of some of the acts themselves, that for a time it seem-
ed best not to attempt the third annual Prudities. Now
that they are to be given, this writer hopes to see such
backing given to the Pruditles that when the time for
the preview comes, not three or four, but six acts may
be judged of merit and worthy to compete for the fine

prizes being offered to the two winning acts.

Organizations

Today the SCARLET AND
BLACK publishes the second of a
series of articles intended to give
a resume of the various campus
organizations, with a description
of their purposes, duties, func-
tions and nature of their mem-
berships. The last issue dealt:
with the Council of House Chair—
men and thc Women’s SelfAGov-
ornment League. Today‘s article
takes up the student Council had
Lantern.

The Student Council: As a central
conference group for mutual under—
standing between the men, women,
and faculty of Grllmell, the student
council discusses and acts on matters
of interest to the student body as a
whole. lts work is carried on by
four committees: recreation, pep, so-
cial, and traditions and hospitality,
two, chairman being elected for each.
a girl by the women and a man by
the men. Besides these members.
the council consists of the presidents
of the two Y’s, the president and
treasurer of the W. s. G. L., the pres—
ident of the Council of House Chair-
men, the editor of thc SCARLET
AND BLACK, and s treasurer elect-
ed by the men,

The Lantern: This body is com-
posed of the heads ~0f the various
men’s organizations in school, be-
sides representatives from the SCAR—
LET AND BLACK, the Cyclone, the
National Collegiate Players. and the
student Council. all of which are not
strictly men’s organizations. Hold—
ing meetings twice monthly, it dis
cusses campus problems and when
changes seem desirable on the cam-
pus, instigates such changes. By

Exaggerate—Gard

Most of the current criti sin of
the newspaper has no support in
fact, said Prof. Wayne Card of the‘
journalism department of Grinnell, in
speaking Tuesday to t be freshman
class, in one of a series of orienta-
tion lectures given by various mem—
bers of the faculty. 1

“For instance," he said, "one
hears a great deal about the sup-
posedly enormous space which news-
papers glve to accounts of crime.
But what are the facts? An
analysis of New York papers made
public recently by the noted,scient—
ist. Henry Fairﬁeld Osborn, showed,
that these papers devoted only two
and a half per cent of their space to
crime news. In considering papers
published over a wider area, a study
made at the University of oregon
showed that news of crime occupied
only three and a half per cent of the
total newspaper space.

Caters to Public

“The SOACalled sensational news-
paper represents only a catering to
popular taste. This is indicated by
the fact that, with few exceptions,
the more sensational papers have the
larger circulations. It is popular
taste, more than the newspaper,
which is at fault. While, of Course,
a newspaper should lead its readers
rather than follow them—and most
papers do leadia paper cannot at.
ford to be too far ahead of its pub-
lic; if too advanced, it soon will lose
its inﬂuence and, unless it is subside
ized, it will die.

Ml', Gard declared that American
journalism had gone much beyond
that of any other country, not only
in giving a comprehensive picture of

music and oLher things men are in-
terested in, Lentem provides the
means whereby Grinnell men may
express themselves on a common
basis.

right a defeat handed them by the
Billikens a week ago here. After
a series of fourteen consecutive vies
tories, the St. Louisans relapsed af—
ter their Iowa invasion the ﬁrst of

tcck of South Dakota State at st,
Louis last Saturday by the score of

Louis city fives who will form the
opposition for the Pionccrs this
weekend, Washington and st. Louis,
met in an intro—city cage contest,
their last before they encounter Grin-
nell.

In addition to battling for confer
ence honors when they tangle with
the Washington university quintet.
the Pioneers will be fighting to set
the record books right for posterity.
Up to this year the Bears have tak—

season Grinnell can even the count.

, Campus Opinion

Question: Would you favor a cen—
tral plum for the distribution of mail
such as A. R. H. or the Y rooms?

llclcu Lovcjoy: I think it would be
a good idea. lt would help to cre-
ate a friendly spirit among the men
and women and would bring the
good and dorms together.

Carol anthrop: It would he
somcwhat inconvenient and as one
person would probably get the mail
for a whole group or floor,l doubt if
many more contacts would be made.

Lyle Sholmidin : No, 1 like the
present plan much better.

.yutln Evans: Perhaps that would
prove successful and yet it would be
inconvenient for those who would
not otherwise have to leave the
quad or dorms, If such a system for
distribution was used it would be
quite necessary to have some way to
eliminate the congestion that would
undoubtedly arise. I'm in favor of
trying it, anyhow, to see how many
people really would benefit from it.

Helen Carlson: The present sys-
tem is satisfactory. However. it
would be much more convenient if
mail were delivered to each cottage.

Randall Klemm ~ No. At present l
get my mail in bed. Under the pro-
posed system I'd have to trudge all
the way down to A. R, H. in pajamas
and goloshes.

Helcn Kaufman. No, It would be
less convenient because of the dis-
tance involved.

Claude Weloon; I do not believe it
would be a practical solution to the
problem of the distribution of mail
because of the inconvenience it
would occasion in going for it. The
present system makes it much more
convenient for everybody.

Dorothy rorcth: Yes, because it
would be more convenient and also
serve as a mixer.
