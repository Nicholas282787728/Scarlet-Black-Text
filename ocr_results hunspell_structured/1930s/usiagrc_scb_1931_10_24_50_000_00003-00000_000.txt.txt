Drama of English Society
Has Strong Comedy

Rehearsals for “The First Mrs.
Fraser,” homecoming play which is
to be given here Nov. 5 and s, are
progressing favor-ably, Mrs. Sara
Sherman Pryor, director of drama,
said today. The entire play has been
rehearsed, and the cast is working
on the third act, and polishing up
the first and second acts.

“The First Mrs. Fraser," which
was written by St. John Ervine, a
modern Irish writer. contains a
strong comedy element, with an ap-
preciation of English social life. The
action centers around the matrimon»
ial difficulties of James Fraser, a
middleaged Scotchman, and their
subsequent reaction on the emotions
of Janet, the first Mrs. Fraser.

At the opening of the play, Janet
has completely readjusted her life
since her divorce of five years past,
and is living in an English apartment
with her younger son, Ninian, a son—
ior at Oxford. While she has found
comparative contentment in the
friendship of Philip, an old suitor,
and the frequent.visits of her elder
son Murdo, and his wife Alice, James
Fraser is leading a restless and bar-
assed life with his second wife, El—
sie. ‘who is but half his age.

a most amusing situation is cre-
ated when James calls on his former
wife for advice and consolation, only
to be followed by his philandering
"second,” who has come for a differ-
ent purpose. The ensuing upheaval
in Janet's life provides “The First
Mrs. Fraser" with its less farcial and
more dramatic moments.

The cast for ”The First Mrs Fras-
er' includes Mrs. Janet Fraser, the
first, Faith Somers: Mrs. Elsie
Fraser, Virginia Read; James Fraser,
Joseph Irwin: Ninian Fraser, his
younger son, William Pryor; Murdo
Fraser, his elder son, Lee Alexander;
Mrs, Murdo Fraser (Alice). Ruth
Bauer; Philip Logan, Walter Straley;
Mabel, the maid, Fern Hulsebus.
