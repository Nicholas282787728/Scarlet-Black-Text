English Comedy

(Continued from page ll
James Fraser, interpreted by Joseph
Irwin, dominated all three acts of the
play with his unconscious cgotism
and attitude of pcrsonal injury. Alr
though consistently over-played
throughout. Mr. Irwin's cxcollcnt
Scotch accent and convincing maker
up lent an air of realism to the play
and was responsible for much of its
humor.

stralcy Goad

His visits to Janet for consolation
and advice regarding the behavior
of Elsie. the second Mrs. Fraser.
created an impossible situation for
Janet, whose poise and neat handling
of the matter admirably offset and
revealed the selfishness and tactlcss-
ness of other characters directly
involved.

One of the bright spots of the play
was the effective characterization of
Philip Logan, Janet's persistent suit—
or, by Walter Stralcy. thtlc humor,
wisecracks, and sly handling of
gossipy tidbits describe Mr. Stralcy’s
contributions to the comedy, and his
versatile adaptation to the part was
noteworthy,

Sous Opposite

The role of Ninian Fraser. pseudo-
sophisticated younger son of Janet,
was well taken by William Pryor.
His extremely unfilial attitude to—
wards James, a product partly of his
own sensitive nature and regard for
his mother and partly of his Oxford
training. was always received with
tolerance hu-t effectively subdued by
Janet. -

Opposed to the impetuosity of Nin-
ian was the calm‘, deliberate attitude
of Murdo Fraser, Janet’s elder son.
played by Lee Alexander. A striking
makeup reminiscent of tin—types of
a bygone era gave Murdo a villain-
ous appearance, in contrast to his
blond younger brother. Murdo‘s
Scottish clan spirit. which led him
to attempt to plan his mother’s fu-
ture, was a constant source of humor,
particularly whenever it extended in-
to Alice, his wife's, affairs. The part
of Alice, the ldving, submissive wife,
was convincingly taken by Ruth
Bauer.

ltcnd Realistic

Elsie Fraser, the second, was real-
istically portrayed by Virginia Read.
The direct antithesis of Janet, Elsie
was revealed as a young, pleasure-
seeking, mercenary woman, with few
moral soruples and even less tact.

When she brazenly calls on the
first Mrs. Fraser for her help in di-
vorcing James so she can marry a
titled Englishman and at the same
time carry on a liaison with a young
Spanish dancer, Elsie. is forced to
”Show her hand.” in spite of an un-
sympathetic role, Miss Read succeed-
ed in arousing admiration by her
capable acting.

Directed by Pryor

Mabel, the maid, was played by
Fern Hulsebus, and although handi—
capped by a minor role. Miss Hulse-
bus did a creditable bit of acting.

“The First Mrs. Fraser” was pro-
duced by Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor,
director of drama, and the scene was
designed by Margaret Napier, grad-
uate assistant in the speech depart-
ment. The production staff for the
play included Joseph Irwin, technical
director; lrwin Oxley, stage malls
ager; Robert Poiachek, assistant
stage manager; Margaret Wright,
proper-ties manager; Wynona Ewoldt,
costumes; Mary Carothcrs, lighting;
Mary Gary, workshop manager;
Frank Fllrbush, business manager.

Campus Opinion

What do you think of Clark Ilflll‘s
pL’lln ioi- regulating the extrurcurric»
war and social activities of mesh—
men?

Charles Buns: 1 think that it is a
fine idea to replace the old prepping
program, recently abolished in Clark,
by this system of supervising the
freshmen.

lllarian Man: it certainly is a good
plan to limit a freshman's number
of nights out a week, and particular—
ly if his grades are low, whether it's
for men or women.

Robert Poinchek: I think it's a
mistake to make such severe regula-
tions for freshmen. By the time a
person gets to college he should
know pretty well what he wants to
do.

Louiiie Morris. I think i 's a good
idea. Then there shouldn’t be so
many freshmen flunking out.

Waldo Childs: it's all right to keep
the freshmen in to study when their
grades are low in any dormitory.

Esther Benshooi: It cultivates good
study habits for the preps and gets
them started on the right track, It‘s
a good plan.

John Canning, '31, editor of The
Scarlet and Black last year, who is
attending Northwestern university
this year, is here for homecoming.

The history of Women’s Honor G
is one of evolution in the idea of the
organization, the kind of awards, and
the standards for admission.

In 1911 the Women’s Honor G club
was organized under the sponsor-ship
of Miss Clara J, Andersen, head of
the women's physical education dee
partmeut, because it was felt that
an incentive and reward was needed
for outstanding athletes. Membership
could be gained by accumulating
three points by outstanding work in
hockey, basketball, archery, tennis,
and hiking, each sport giving one
point toward the total.

_ Gave Sweaters

Two years after the forming of
the club, the practice of giving
sweaters was begun and continued
for five years when the policy of the
National Women's Athletic associ-
ation against the presenting of re-
wards of value changed the award
to pins. For several years the pins
were given by the Honor G, but they
now are purchased by the members
if they desire them. the emphasis be-
ing placed on the honor of being a
member rather than the tangible rc-
words.

In 1928 the idea that the organiz-
