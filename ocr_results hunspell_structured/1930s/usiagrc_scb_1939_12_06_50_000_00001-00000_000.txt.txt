Thomson & Patek
Take Close Win
In Bridge Final

By Clyde Bates.

Out of a maze of business dour
bles, trumped aces, and whatnot,
have emerged Smith hall-s own
"handful of heroes,” Byron Patel:
and Robert Thomson, the champs
of the White House bridge tour-
hey.

Monday afternoon. as the last
rays of afternoon sunlight slanted
through the west windows, Vii--
ginia Paul and Doris Johnson,
battered and bruised after a
game fight, yielded to the super-
ior power of the PateleThoinson
combination.

Perhaps destiny had a hand in
the outcome. Each pair had won
two rubbers sitting north and
south.

it was the last rubber, even up.
The whistle blew. First hand,
Thomson to Patekagame. Next
hand«~Patek to Thomsonislaln!
Thomson and Patch win to cop
the $4.00 prizes (a mystery as
yet).

“We owe our success to clean
llving‘," said Patek and Thom-
son, “Never having dulled our
minds with alcohol and that vile
weed, tobacco, we are at all times
alert and ready to take advan-
tage of opportunity when it
comes,”

nasium ruins will begin during
Christmas vocation, L. v. Phelps,
treasurer, announced today. stu
dent help will be employed on the
project.

.All of the bricks are to be

the foundation of the gym will
be allowed to remain intact until
the trustees decide upon its dise

 

position, Phelps said.

Finance Plan

Trustees to Vote
December 15 On
New Proposal

New plans for financing the Scar»
let and Black will be presented to,
the trustees at the December 15
meeting by Pres. John S. Nollen,
it was learned today from W
liani Pcderseh, president of the
Student Council. '

The new plan, as adopted by
the Student Council, is first subs
Jecl: to the approval in part by
the Council of House Presidents
and the Women's Social Budget,
Pedersen explained. These re-
spective bodies will act on the
new proposal this week.

Plan Proposed.

The proposed plan calls for fi-
nancing the Scarlet and Black
out of the semester fee allotment,
by a gradual increase, until 1942,
when the student newspaper will
be ﬁnanced entirely by the semes-
ter fee fund.

This will necessitate reducing
the allotment to hand uniforms,
the Council's own allotment, and
will make it necessary for the
Council of House President and
the Women's Social Budget to
take over the financing of the
White House, student recreational
center.

Details Given.

The plan as presented to Pre-
sideiit Noileh is as follows:

Last spring at the meeting of
the Committee on Student Organ-
izations and Publications, the pre-
sident of the Student Council was
reminded that the apportionment
or the Semester Fee for this year
does not provide for the students’
subscriptions to the Scarlet and
Black, an obligation that was
placed on the student .Council by

Average Crinnell Student Can Name Less Than One—Half
Of Campus Leaders According to Results of Sé‘B Poll

 

Once upon a time thene was a
student leader, but he wasn't
much ot a student leader, accord-
ing to the average Crinnell stu—
dent, It seems mat 11 per centl
of the students didn't know what
he was leading. 34 per cent of
the populace thought (he was
someone else, and 29 per cent be~
ilieved he had never returned
from the Brooklyn parley.

Of course it isn't strictly true,
but results obtained by a recent
poll ct students at Grinnell indi-
cate a large percentage or truth
in the statement. Taking a slam.
pie survey of two persons from
each hall and cottage, the find
ings showed that of 42 student
leaders, the average Crinnellian
will answer correctly slightly less
than tifty per cent when asked
to name the president of this or

that group.

 

Providing the student has been
at Grinhell at least a year, this
margin of awareness holds. If he
or she is a new student this year,
then the chances are that the
neophyte can name a little more
than 24 per cent of the bigsmen-
andewom-eneon-Campus. Orienta-
tion, no doubt, has created this
Sherlock Holmeselike capacity for
observation among the preps.

Some of the enlightening facts
obtained by the survey show that
the best known leader on this
campus is hot, as might be ex—
pected, the president of the stue
dent Council, the head of the
men’s government, or the presi-
dent ot the women’s executive
board.

The best known man on the
campus, as brought out in the
poll, was Mao: Shelton as presi-
dent of the men's Honor ”G"

club. Only one person out of the
4D~odd quizzed did not know who
fills chapel each morning, Four
students did not know who presi .
ed at the Brooklyn parley, nine
couldn't name the head of the
men's government, (they weren’t
coeds), and six thought Jean Hill
was just a nice girl who some
times runs college central.

A man named Theodore Hobs
son seems to be running the
Young Men’s Christian associa—
tion with the help of Jack Sav—
age. "Bl'onko" Kuhl decidedly
outpointed "Yank" Atkins for
business manager of the Scarlet

Student Council
To Ask That 1939
Plan Be Permanent

Through an informal poll con—
ducted by the student Council in
the dormitories and the quadran—
gle last night, it was learned that
the majority of students wish to
have the Thanksgiving recess cut
to one day instead of continuing
the four-day vacation which has
been given in the past.

The Student Council will rec—
ommend that the one day vaca—
tion be put on next year's cal-
endar when it is worked out by
the registrar’s orrice, according
to William Pedersen, Council
president.

This year, Thanksgiving vacate
tion, although held only one day,
was originally scheduled to be a
four day period, the change be—
ing made because Iowa and Illie
hois, the states from which the
majority of Crinnell students
come, celebrated Thanksgiving
on two separate dates.

Pedersen, Harry Kies, and Rob-
ert Whitley conducted the sur—
vey in the dormitories and
Jean Hill in the quadrangle. '
