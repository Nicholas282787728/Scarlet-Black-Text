Council Plans

Hall Trophies

Considers Several ideas

for Phone Booths

Trophies for winners of intramural
sports were assured at the meeting
of the Council of House Presidents
Thursday evening, when it was tier
cided that the building treasuries and

the council will cooperate with thel

athletic department in financing the
awards.

The plan also calls for a reduction
in price of the awards, which have
previously been made by the athletic
department without assistance. Final
arrangements concerning the oppor-
tionment of the cost will be made
with John C. Truesdale, director of
athletics, later this week.

Action upon the establishment of
private phone booths in the men's
halls was postponed until estimates
of the cost of the two suggested lo-
cations have been completed. Con-
version of the third ﬂoor trunk-lift
closets. and the building of booths
around the present telephones, are
the alternatives being considered.

Treasurers of buildings and campus
organizations which had money on
deposit in the Crinncll State bank
will meet with President J. s. Nollen
and L. v. Phelps, treasurer of the
college, to discuss the signing of
waivers so that the bank can reopen
upon a restrlcted basis.

A request to students for the re
turn of silverware to the dormitory
dining room will be made by the coun-
cil within the next few days.

Cook, Manly Find Tickets;
Others Not Yet Turned In

Two of the free Brown Derby
tickets which were dropped from a
Stinsoh-Detroiter monoplane at 1 p.
m. Thursday afternoon, were found
by George Cook and Margaret Mor—
dy.

It was reported that the remaining
two tickets were picked up, but they
have not yet been turned in, in ex-
change for a regular ticket to the
dance.

"The persons who are in possession

f the free tickets should turn
them in to me immediately, in ex-
change for a ticket to the Drag,"
said Arthur Hough, manager of the
dance, today.

STIMULATE READING

The recently formed dormitory
libraries have stimulated a new in-
terest in reading, according to Rob
inson Shoulberg, library commission
head. More than 100 volumes have
already been withdrawn. The librar-
ies have been converted into reading
rooms, and the men are being on-
couraged to browse in them.
