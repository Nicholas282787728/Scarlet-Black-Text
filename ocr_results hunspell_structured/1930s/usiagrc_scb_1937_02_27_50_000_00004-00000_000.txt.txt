SMOKING IN THE REC ROOM

The problem of where Grinnell students
may’ smoke is coming up again, as more and
more of them are asking why it would not
be possible to allow men to smoke some
place in the quadrangle.

‘ The recent action of the League Bond
and Council of House Presidents in granting
women permission to smoke in the men’s
club rooms has been much appreciated; and
we believe the men could be extended Simi-
lar hospitality in the quadrangle. There are
obviously many objections to men’s smok-
ing in the cottage parlors, but it seems that
the recreation room would be a Suitable
place.

The fact that a good deal of money has
recently been spent in improving the floor
of the recreation room—an improvement
that would be nullified if careless smokers
scattered ashes around on the floor—is
voiced by some people as the reason smok—
ing should not be allowed ther .

However, we believe that if sufficient
ash trays were provided, there would be lit—
tle danger of such carelessness. And both
men and women are anxious to keep the
floor fit for dancing; both would be anxious
not to abuse the privilege of smoking in the
recreation room if such a privilege were
granted. Why not then permit smoking in
the recreation room“.7

OPPORTUNITY FOR WRITERS

The Tanager has started its second
contest, in an effort to encourage student
interest in Submitting material. During the
past few years, most of the contributions
printed in The Tanager have been those of
outsiders, with relatively little student ma,—
terial.

Readers have repeatedly expressed
their wish for more campus contributions,
and The Tanager contest of the first semesA
ter was an attempt by ‘he board to arouse
student interest in nu ting, Although the
response was comparatively small, the work
turned in was of an encouraging quality
and provoked favorable comment on the
part of the reader _

There is a dc inite place on the Grin—
nell chmpus for a literary magazine in
which students have a chance to submit
tllei' work for c "ticdl review, and in com-
petition with outside writcrs; and while we
do not propose that The Tanager refuse to

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

publish worthy Ulltsldt‘ contributions, we
int i keep iil mllid that the mag lie was
originally planned to provide a literary rc—
vieu, published {It Gl'inllell college, and stir
den work was to be judged on the same
basis as contributions by other writers

Therefore, all students should support
this contest, as it is all el'i'olt to revive the
“ruling illtcl‘cst ill submitting material to
The Tanager and to make it a more suitable
magazine for our campus; Gl'inllell writers
should avail themselves of this opportunity
to have their wo lx' constructively criticized
and perhaps published.

A TRIBUTE TO THE CHORUS

Several months ago the pages of the
Scarlet a'lld Black were filled with letters
from various students advocating the for»
motion of a chorus for those students who,
for one reason or another, were not ill the
other musical organizations on the campus.
At that time it was felt that thele were
enough students interested in singing to
support such all olgallizatioll.

Now this organization, known as the
Pioneer chorus, is entering its second se—
mester with a fine record of accomplislr
ment behind it. Two concerts have been
given including a program of Christmas Carr
01 The quality of the singing has amply
justified the c. tencc of the chorus and the
concerts have been well received by the
student body and the faculty. _

Such results are not accomplished Wllil‘ir
out hard work, and too much credit cannot
be given to the director alld~the committee
for their “ork ill behalf of the chorus. But
the real value and success of the chorus
comes to the members in that hour each
wcelc they devote to singing under capable
leadership.

The chorus has proved its worth, and
it is to be hoped that more students will
avail themselves of the opportunity to get
the musical experience find pleasure which
it provides. Certainly it is a tribute to the
student body when a student actiVlty such
as this is successful.

(Christian Science Monitor)

Philosopher: one of the paradoxes of mechan-
ical progress is that it reduces the cost of living
in peace, but increases the cost of killing in war.

Statistician: Quite true, unlessi

Philosopher Unless what?

Statistician: Well, it's not possible to say
what the hill {or another world war would be.
BuL if preparedness ﬁgures are used as a basis of
estimate, the $10,730,ooo,ooo which the Foreign
Policy Association finds was spent on armaments
by the nations in 1936 indicates a new scale of
expenditures in the event of another waria scale,
indeed, which would make the costs of the last
major conﬂict seem very reasonable. Careful au-
diting plates the price of killing World war soir
diers at 525,000 per head. In another war the
price will be much higher per soldier unless the
campaigns are managed more economically.

Philosopher: Economically?

Statistician: Oh, I don't mean economically
as applied to men. Quite the reverse, in fact

Philosopher: You mean?

Statistician: Don’t look like that! I'm not
wishing for this, I’m Just racing it. Present rates
of spending on arms are at least three times what
they were in 1914. So unless many more than the
10,ooo,ooo soldiers who were lost in those years
can be done away with in another war, it will be
found that the cost per man has skyrocketed to a
truly shocking figure,

Philosopher: You might like to add that the
preparations for this other war will prove cut of
all proportions to the achievement.

Statistician: You're being sarcastic, professor.
BuL don't you see, nobody has yet devised a way
of calculating the value of human life in figures?
The dollar co‘ is plain, however. All we statis-
ticians can do is report it and analyze it. It's up
to you philosophers to interpret the more abstract
meaning.

Philosopher: By which you mean, I suppose, to
elaborate upon the simple fact that it’s cheaper to
live in peace than to die in war, And, 1 might
add, quite as usefu 7Chtisliztn Science Monitor

omments of
the Readers

Editor, Scarlet and Black
Dear Sir:

After reading a recent editorial
entitled "On Dormitory Governr
merit" there was loft in my mind
a feeling of utter disgust, not
from the subject but from the
contents of the editorial. To me
it displayed a thorough lack of
knowledge of the circumstances
which surround men’s government.
in the first place, men’s govern-
ment could become one of regula
tions and dictatorship if so desired
but men of Cr nail in the past
and at the present are proud of
the fact that they are free of
such a type of regulation and
can control their actions, or pre-
sumably so, by the fact that they
have pride in their own discretion
and ability to take care of them-
selves. il any other type of gov-
ernment were set up .there would
undoubtedly be a definite re
action.

The Council of House Presidents
is made up of individuals who
have been elected to the coveted
position of president of their re-
spective buildin a. Their clecticn
indicated a desire on the part of
the hall members to cooperate
with them in maintaining order
and regulation in the buildings
If such cooperation iS not dis»
played it is the fault of the men
for not electing a president in
whom they have confidence. The
system 0[ “quiet hours” was put
into effect for the purpose of
helping each indiVidual in every
hall, and for the success of such
a plan, the cc-operation of every
man is necessary, and not one
man who supposedly their
chosen ieadel. Self-government
implies government by each in
dividual working in co-operation
With every other individual, not
one man trying to enforce a die»
tatoriai rule on a body. This is
the fundamental by which self-
government displays its power
and effect. if there are those
who are dissatisfied with the pre~
sent scheme then let themselves
be known and suggest a new type
of government, or, if wishing to
try the only logical alternative, 3
dictatorial system, then make the,
agitation so strong that the
lenders Will be forced to set up
such a system.

progressive is a term used to
imply the advancement by succes-
sive stages or degrees. To what
stage does the author of the
editorial wish men’s government
to advance? Could he name the
two or three steps which should
come next and would still mainr
tam the lack of herd supervision
and individual freedom now
existing under the dorm system ‘1
Men’s government is not one of
progressiveness because of the
nature of our unique plan be-
lieving that the individual man
has enough common sense to re
gulnte himself. Last year when
the Chairman of the Council of
House Presidents stated “that all
the Council need do is to continue
the efforts and policies of the out»
going officers” one could oh-
viously see that this was complie
menting last years Council which
had done an excencnt job of men’s
government and met successfully
a serious crisis, emerging victor
iously. The statement made‘ by
the Chairman plainly indicated
that the new Council would con-
tinue to meet successfully all
crises that might confront them.
What could he more compli-
mentary to an out—going Council
and at the same time a. better
statement of the policy of the
new Council than the statement
made by the new chairman?

Naturally no government can
be perfect in all phases but the
chiding this editorial gave the
present men's government is enr
tirely inexcusable,

 

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1937

May I State that the idea. of
publishing cditcriais on govern-
ment composed by the board is
entirely fair and constructive for
it displays a decided recognition
that there is such c thing as
student government, but may the
editorials on this subject be
written by the board and not by
individuals who may be biased or
uninformed on certain phases of
the subject.

This criticism is entirely per-
sonnal and is the reaction of no
organized body.
