Local Eleven
Foe at Tutor
,- Homecoming

Morgan Out, Fini Returns

for Game Saturday
at Cedar Falls

.-
BY FRANK BEATLE

It’s homecoming week at Iowa State
Teachers college at Cedar Falls, and
the guest of honor Saturday will be
none other than the Crinnell College
football team. ‘

The Pioneer homecoming this year
was spoiled, more or less, by the
Carleton gridders who are’numbered
among the six victorsover Crinnell,
so Watt’s men will make a desperate
effort to turn the tables on the 'hltors.

Strong Despite Losses

Speaking of desperate efforts. some
mention should be made of the Pior
neer season to date. ln the six games
played, only two teams, Michigan
State and Iowa State, have been able
to defeat Gr'mnell by more than a
one—touchdown margin. The Spars
tons, undefeated as yet, were victors
over the scarlet and black by but two
touchdowns, winning 33 to 20, and
the latter, surprise power in mid-west
athletics, won by three touchdowns,
as to 6.

Much has been written about last
Saturday’s game with Creighton uni.
,versity at Omaha, which Grinnell
dropped in the last two minutes of
play, because of a badly placed for.
ward pass and a weakening Pioneer
line. sadly lacking in reinforcements.
All that need be said now that the
game is a matter,of past tense, is
that it represented the potential power
of a Grinnell team which may be ex.
pected to come to the‘ fore in the last
three contests of the season.

Blocking Improved

In the Bluejay fracas, Pioneer play»
ers blocked harder than at any time
during the season. although still show—
ing the need of more individual in.

.‘ This Age One
of Doubt’ Says
Vesper Speaker

“The symbol of this age is a ques.
tion mark; is motto is ‘query'," de.
clared the Rev. Mr. H. s. Wilkinson
in his address at vespers Sunday. Our
age is still accurately characterized
by the title of Henry Van Dyke’s
book ”the Gospel for an Age of
Doubt." But doubt may be used in
two senses; as scrutiny, and as an-
certainty and psrplexity, the speaker
declared I "

“We have been and are living in an
age ofrtransition. The intellectual tur—
moil of the past so years has never
been equalled in the history of
thought." Is it any wonder then that
we are still gasping for breath? asked
Mr. Wilkinson.

Sometimes men fear that religion
will cease to hold the heart of man,
pointed out the speaker. Then they
should turn to Christ for “he alone is
the irrefutable argument, the invinc.
ible champion.”

Since this is the age of Science.
Christianity invokes all to investigate
in claims, said Dr. Wilkinson, There.
fore apply the two great max'uns
which rule in the scientific world:
first. "be sure of your facts", and sec
cond, “adopt the theory of explanation
which presan fewest difficulties
while best explai ng all the facts,"
he challenged.

General contrasts within the coun»
