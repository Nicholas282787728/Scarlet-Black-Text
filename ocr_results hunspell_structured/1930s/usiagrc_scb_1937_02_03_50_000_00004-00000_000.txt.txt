WHAT IS SOCIALISM'J

has

Socialism is the genei' 1 term applied to
the doctrines which 0 iginated from the
teachings of Karl Marx, There are many
different types of socialism The Christian
Science Monitor says that in the main ‘fSo—
cialism is that projected system in which
wealth would be redistributed, in which
there would be social ownership of land,
capital, and productive resources, and. in
which ‘surplus ,v2llue’ or profit would be
largely wiped out."

Socialism, unlike Communism, if it suc-
ceeds capitalism, will do so without the use
of Violent methods. Socialists believe that
capitalism will eventually collapse and so»
cialism will take its place.

Socialism will maintain free speech, free
assembly and suffrage, according to the
leading advocates of the system.

In the United States the political strat-
egy of the Socialists is to establish a strong
Farmer—Labor party which would embrace
all radical groups including the Progressives
and the Communists in it great worker’s
party.

What would be the program of the So«
cialists if they come to power in the United
States? They say that they would Social-
ize the great industries and then gradually
move toward their goal of social ownership
of land, capital and productive resources,

The Socialist party would not create a
huge bureaucracy, Norman Thomas asserts.
It has fl plan for a decentralized control of
industry by workers and managers.

Thus far, the Socialists have been suc‘
cesst’ul in that they have seen parts of their
program adopted and put into law by the
great major parties in the United States.
At the present time the Socialists control
the French government, while they have
frequently been a force in Great Britain,
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.

FEDERAL DRAMAS
(Daily Trojan)

Satisfaction for lovers of legitimate theatrical
productions is being offered in ample measure by
the Federal Theater projects, sponsored and pror
duced by the government in five different these

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

tors in Les Angeles. The Federal Theater pro-
ductions are also proving successful from is fi
nancini standpoint, which is something many pii»
vately-financed shows have been unable to ac»
compiisn in this city for many years, clue to the
strong influence of motion pictures on the south
ern California public.

Government agents at the head of Federal
Theater projects have employed experienced men
and women to rrin their plays. I'he casts for the
shows are not composed or old, broken down hands
who have seen their headiiucr days pass long ago,
They are furnishing many youngsters in the thea-
trical game a chance to get started, as well as
adding to the experience of men and women who
have long been active on the stage and screen,

All the glamour and verve of a. New York
production greets the theatcreg'ocr at a Federal
play. The orchestra with traditional overture.
adds a feeling of reality that has been generally
lacking at show houses unable to provide more
than recordings or an organ because of financial
press.

compared with cities of the same size
throughout the country, Los Angeles has had relr
atively few good legitimate plays. The favor of
the public has been turned largely to the motion
picture. Judging from the appeal already made
by the Federal Theater projects, there is a splenr
did chance that interest in stage shows may be
stimulated enough to bring the return of private
productions, opening more jobs for actors, stage-
hands, directors, rind theater employees.

Federal theaters are to be encouraged in their
two-fold program of providing relief jobs for him-
dreds and helping to cure a very sick industry by
setting it on its feet once more,

C.
HIGHWAY NIGHT LIFE nan
(Iowa State Studentl

Deaths from automobile accidents at night dur-
ing the last 6 years have INCREASED 37 percent,
while deaths from daytime driving have DEA
CREASED 12 percent.

In nearly all of these reports of night accidents
published by the Travelers Insurance, Indemnity
and Fire Insurance Companies, Hartford, Conn,
there is evidence that someone was driving faster
than he could safely see ahead or without the aid

, of proper headlights or highway illumination.

The eyes of human beings eren't built like
those of owls—to see in the dark, norv are they
built to see around curves and hills.

A driver boasts, "I put 'er up to 60 and keep
’er there. I can keep 'er there even on hilly roads
and on roads full of curves."

We don't doubt that what he says is true.
own boast is the evidence against him.

A driver ought to have self-imposed speed
limits—one for rainy days, one for clear days, an-
other for night driving and one for other kinds of
bad weather

Reports from night accidents show that ' the
limit of safety is sadly stretched. Here are a few:

"Ran into truck."

“Didn't see pedestrian until too late to stop."

“Blinded by oncoming headlights, crashed car
ahead that was slowing down for turn.”

“Hit bridge abutment.”

“Crashed into wreck of two cars that has col-
lided ten minutes earlier."

These statements can all be traced directly to
excessive speeds at night, with perhaps sleepiness,
etc. as additional factors A good rule to follow
has been suggested; that is, never drive so fast at
night but that you can stop within the range of
your own vision.

These are dangerous days, even more dangerous
nights. This year, make them safe for drivers,
passengers and pedestrians. Let’s quit trying to
emulate the last war in point of deaths. Live and
let live.

His

G

No doubt similar episodes to this have often
happened in colleges. But it's still good. We are
thinking of the pyschology professor who stomped
into his first hour class, threw down his notes and
began to lecture. Rapidly, concisely, using his
best witticisms, he talked for 15 minutes. Then
he stopped,

“Any questions?" he asked, There were none,

So he began to ask some questions of this stu-
dent and that. None of them could answer.

“Good Lordl" he burst out finally. "Have I
spent this whole semester for nothing? Don't
you know a blessed thing about this course?"
And a brave boy raised his hand and said, "No

This is a class in eighteenth century prose."

__.c,_‘

Faculty people dance and Irish occasionally as
well as their students, so each campus generally
has its faculty dancing club. At one of these
affairs, is professor of education began to dance
with the wife of another instructor.

As the first dance wore on, the educator began
to complain vociferousiy of the floor, the music,
and even hinted that his partner possibly wasn’t
quite up to snuff as a dancer.

Everything was solved, however, when his
partner informed the professor that he still had on
his rubbers,

Sir.

 

DORIC

With today's Doric the present
editor completes one year‘s service.
One of my spies says that a cer-
tain Gel-men prof has carped to
his class that this editor has a
complete misapprehension of the
meaning of the exalted heading,
Doric. For his benefit we repeat
the definition published in our f st
eftort a twelvcmt’i‘tth ago, “Truth
is beauty, beauty is truth, and this
is a column of pure beauty."

IT WORIHES ME ’ihc k
«. ardents seem to dons well
with a photographic mein
as everyone else does with n

it would take an A student,
which is synonymous in our
mind with genius, to pass most
of these tests if it weren't for
the foot that the A. s. curi
write legihly.
