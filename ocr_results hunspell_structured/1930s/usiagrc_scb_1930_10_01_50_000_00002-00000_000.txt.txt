JOURNALISM MORE POPULAR.

Monday night 37 men and women answered
The Scarlet and Black call for tryout reporters.
This is a record turnout.

. The. growing interest in journalism has been
evnlcnccd in other ways Journalism ranks first
among the interests of freshman men. Journalism
was shown by the some survey to be the second
greatest interest of freshman women.

_ A few years zlgo there were no courses offered
In direct preparation for newspaper work. Now
there is a department.

These facts evidence for more than the more
popularity of journalism. They evidence it turning
from the general and abstract 1)“ pdration that
liberal arts used to give to specific instruction for
chosen vocations.

Perhaps the economic struggle has become so
sharp that the bourgeois can no longer afford to
spend time dabbling in culture. Perhaps the in-
creasc ill the number of students e'vcrywhcltc has
compelled the inclusioll of many who have no up-
prcciation of arts education.

The emphasis has shifted from the type of gen-
cral knowledge that may he obtained by reading
the Iliad to the type that may be obtained by re»
porting on all sorts of daily news. In any case,
the change from cultural studios to practical ones
is an unmistakable trend of the age.

PROHIBITION AN ILLEGI‘IIMATEJSSUE.

A party issue which involves a change in the
constitution is not a legitimate one. Prohibition
promises to be an important question between the
two major parties in the election of several United
States senators this fall. There is little chance of
the republicans or the democrats putting it into
their 1932 platform.

The federal government cannot chztngc the
prohibition amendment. Threcrfourths of the states
approved the amendment, and upon them would
partly fall the duty of repealing it. Consequently it
is improbable that the question will be adopted by a
party ill 1032.

The republicans sdw ill the 1928 election that in
adopting d plank in favor of prohibition, they
would lose the wet votes, and vice vcrsa. By keep-
ing still on the question, the republicans received
Votes from both groups.

There are four legitimate issues which constitu-
tionally may be adopted by political parties. These
are tax, commerce, financial, and government of
territory questions. The latter subject is it (loud onc,
usedbut the first three have been used by many
parties, especially the first which heads the group
including tariff.

Prohibition has even become the illegitimate
issue of city politics. Some mayors have incorpor-
ated the question into their campaigns.

Illinois expects to make prohibition the im-
portant subject in its senatorial election this fall.
Should the wet condiddtc win, what can he do to
help repeal the amendment?

It is impossible for either major party to guttlu
antcc a change in the amendment. The issue would
have to come up before state houses, and defeat
would be met there, taking the results of a straw
vote of the 48 governors as 0. Sign of their respect-
ive states. More than threesfourths of the gover-

. nors arc in favor of the present amendment, itc-
cording to the vote taken ,by a magazine of
national circulation.

FLASHLIGHT FOOTBALL PICTURES.

Football fans have, for the past decade, at
least, been accustomed to the sight of a photo-
grapher, or a battery of photographers at the sides
lines of the gridiron. getting shots of the football
warriors in action. They have enjoyed thosc pic-
tures when published. Yet a ccrtzlin percentage
of those some fans have voiced some complaints
concerning the taking of flashlights at the night
games here.

Whether Grinncll Wins or loses, flashlights
have no part to play in the game. They are taken
no matter wllo has the ball, if the play is close to
the side and appears to be fairly open. If the blaze
of light frightens the player, he must eventually

become accustomed to it. At Marquette Friday
night, photographers for three newspapers will bc
firing away from the sidelines, and then tho Pio-
nccl‘ gl'idlncn will uppl' to (t light initiation here
last week. At DctrOlt it. will be cvcll worse,
while at Dl‘nk icorgc Yates lllzly bcc soon with his
mustache. camera, and flush gun.

The local photographers are good "It'll ill their
field. They have lllrt with unusual success ill night
action pictlli-t., llill'tl to got at any time. Their pic-
turt“ of tho galncs ulldcr lights have l)t‘ell compar-
able \ ’th the best takcll. Their work from the sides
lines will hamper no one ﬂ. soon as tllc players get
no tilnlctl to all occasional glare. And after all.
the glare is as likely to givc the bull carrier on (\xs
tl'u burst of speed as to lllako him fumble.

DISTRIBUTING SEMESTER FEES

Grillllcll college administration offices already
are efﬁcient in many duties and activities under
their care. Perhaps they will not object to :1 (pics
tion regarding the efﬁciency of the existing method
of distributing the sclncstcr fcc booklets.

The scnlcstcr fee is paid by each student ctthc
time of registration. It seems to an outsider that
it would add little to the work of the ofﬁce to dis-
tribute the semester fee booklets thcn.Undcr the
present. system another entire day and a half are
given ovcr to tllc distribution of tllc booklets. If
the hooklcts could be given out at the time the
student pays for them, extra bookkeeping might
also be eliminated,

It is true the extra time that it student spends
ill going dftt‘r the booklet under the present system
is not so important as the time taken from tllc
routine of ofﬁce work so the student aspect of the
matter is of relative lttlc moment. The possibil»
ity of eliminating thi interruption of routine office
work. however, is it qucstioll worthy of collsidcrns
tion.

Are the men’s tennis courts going to bc work-
cd over for the fill] intramural tournament?

The Grillncll Register is also advocating wins
dows in the press booth at the stadium.

Then there was tllc fellow who said that Grill-
llcll would batter Marquette just enough Friday
night so that Drake would have little trouble in till:-
illg it victory from the Wisconsin team the succeed-
ing weck.

All organist may be able to locate the stops,
but it’s dggl'cvdting to have a card table under one
ilrln and 2t load of books in the other while wanders
illg over the campus looking for it lost sedan.

Grillncll’s first night football game drcw
enough almni to make uppcr classmcn think it was
Homecoming.

The Scarlet and Black regrets that the Gri -
llell high school Tigers incorrectly interpreted com-
ments ill its columns on the Roosevelt gzlmc Friday.
Luck to you!

Two editorials of The Scarlet and {Block this
year, “Public Relations” and “New Quadrangle
Rulcs," have rcceiVed much commendation.

Harvard, it is announced, plans to bpcn a
school of geography. For land’s sakc!

Thieves in Toledo robbed an orchc. ra conduc-
tor of his sheet music. To them, of course, tllc job
was a song.

Chicago is now investigating the tombstone
racket. \Vhen they get to the bottom of things,
they’ll find the causes lic deep.

The Cleveland man who drank 1] glasses of
water and then challenged all comers for the Wat<
or drinking championship, certainly is gifted with
a fine sense of dry humor.

TEE FASHION PLAY
(From the Ottumwa Courier)

Some startling statements regarding the renowned
Passion play at Oberarnrnerguo, which many persons in
this community have seen, are made by Dr. Edward A.
Steiner of Grinnell college. recently returned mm at—
tendance at the production.

Dr. Steiner. professor of applied Christianity and a
writer and lecturer of note, ﬁnds more reverence and
reeling of worship in the current presentation of “The
Green Pastures” on Broadway by its cost of American
Negroes than in the work of Anton Lang and his fellow
players at oberammergau. The world renowned per-
formance across the seas was characterized by the
Iowan as more or "fashion play" than a Passion play.

Writing in the Christian Century his impressions
of this year’s Passion play, Dr. Steiner says: "In
Oberammergau I saw the dying of a great simple re-
ligion and the triumph of materialism. On Broadway 1
had glimpses of the new world which will come.”

Dr. Steiner describes the typical pleasure resort
rush that surrounded the Oberamn-iergau season. its
hurrying, unthinking crowds, the commercialism of the
players in selling their souvenirs. The former natural
settings and simplicity have been replaced by modern,
artiﬁcial, stage effects, and the theatre is so large tew
can hear what the actors say.

"Each character is splendidly posed," he says, "yet
it is stagey, artiﬁcially artful and seldom inspiring. . . .
The play belongs to Judas. To use a vulgar phrase,
-he runs away with the show,‘ and in this respect the
Passion play is unwittingly true. This is the age of
Judas, the age of Broadway crowding out the spirit of
God. . . . and crowding Jesus out of the Passion play."

Speaking of Broadway and the play he saw there,
“The Green Pastures,” Dr. Steiner continues:

“I witnessed another passion play on our own
Broadwayia play without Jesus, but one which creates
something of the old Oberarnrnergau mood.

"Broadway obviously is still under old Testament
dispensation. Numberless Adams and Eves eat of the
forbidden fruit and the tall,is too terrible for the
thought of redemption. Too many Noaho get drunk
on bootleg liquor. If there are perplexed Jobs they take
aspirin to deaden their pain, and they divorce their
scolding wives; yet ”The Green Pastures’ has stirred
Broadway as no other play has for years, and as no
preacher or all of them combined has touched this Main
street of Babylon.

“In operarnrnergau I expected to see God, and 1
saw a good show. On Broadway 1 expected to see a show
and I saw God."

more than enough to supply light and power for

twenty cities of one million population.

Installed in power houses along the waterways,
these machines transform the strength of mighty
