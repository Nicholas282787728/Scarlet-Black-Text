Swimmers Down BluejaiysI
Friday by Score
of 64 to 19

Four pool records and a Grinnell
college mark were toppled by the
Grinnell swimming team in over-
whelming the Creighton university‘
mermcn, 64 to 19, here yesterday at-
ternoon. ,

Grinnell men placed first in each
of the nine events, and received points
for second place in five races. From
the start of the meet it was evident
that the only competition offered
would be given by one Grinnell man
to another, and in several of the‘
races the Pioneers outswam their ops
pohents to finish lengths ahead.

Adams, Elbert, Malbrougli star

Bob Adams, Clark Elbert and Dave
Malbrough were the outstanding per-
formers for the afternoon, each scor-
ing two wins and sharing in the 300-
yard medley relay honors. Adams
won the so and the IOU-yard dashes,
and in doing so he shattered two of
the pools records by wide margins.
His time for the 60 yard dash was
31.7 seconds, bettering the old mark
by 1.8 seconds. His other record was
only for the college. '

Elbert won first place in the 200-;
yard breast stroke and set a new
pool record of 6 minutes and 3.2 sec-‘
onds for the Mil-yard swim. In the‘
latter event he finished seven lengths
ahead of the nearest Creighton man.

Sets Back stroke Record l

Malbrough also set a record by
lowering the time in the 150-yard
backstroke by 4 seconds. He was tied
for first place in the 220-yard dash
with Al Roth, and aided in the medley
relay victory. '

Probably the closest competition,
given by the Creighton group was ini
the diving division, with Shepherd
per-forming for Grinnell and O'Brien
diving for the Omaha team, Each of
the men took 10 dives. five compulsory

money or to get low rates of interestj

Still in Thirties, Chi—cago Theologian
l

Gains Fame as Lecturer, Professor

Born in Germany, Dr. Pauck
Came to United States
Five Years Ago

By Malcom Thompson

Although still in his early thirties,
Dr. Wilhelm Pauck, professor of
church history in the Chicago The.
ological seminary, who will deliver the
annual Gates lectures in Herrick
chapel, next week, has already ac-
quired an enviable reputation as a
professor and lecturer.

His attitude toward religious mat-
ters may best be described as that
of a conservative modernist.

Born in Germany

Born in Germany, Dr Pnuck was
too young for military service in the
World war, during which he worked
on a farm. About five years ago he
came to America as an exchange stu-

Nollen Advises

Student Bodies

‘Freeclom Only Accessible
by Self Cont‘rol’

“We can attain freedom only by
self control," declared Pres. John S,
Nollen to a mass meeting of Grinnell
men students Wednesday evening in
Herrick chapel. “You all know what
happens to the train that jumps its
track."

Wednesday evenings meeting was
the second~of'two gatherings called

by President Nollen this week for the:

purpose of advising and warning the
students of Grinnell college. Tuesday
evening the women students were ad-
drssed.
Names Taboos

To the men, President Nollen stated
that stealing. drinking. gambling and
indulgence in extreme emotional out»
lets would not be tolerated on the
campus, Women were told that drink-
regula-
tions in regard to “hours,” and hitchs
hiking were taboo.

President Nollen advised men Stu-
dents that Grinnell was an "educa-
tional community,” and thus different
from a large university, Only by co.
operation could men live together in

]this community, he asserted, and “the

only logical punishment for the per-
son who cannot cooperate is exclu-
sion from the community."

Lists Rules

For success in college life, Presi—
den Nollen advised that men:

1. Sleep eight hours every night.

2, Eat three meals a day, but not
too much at a meal.

a, Bathe once a day.

, Budget money and time.

, Be courteous and punctual.

. Do not tell smutty stories.

. Do not drink intoxicating liquor.

3. Have self respect and regard for
others—particularly respect for we»
men.

In regard to “necking" and "blank-
et partiesm President Nollcn said,
“If you take a beautiful thing like
love and drag it in the mire, you
have committed a Crime."

Ailams, Roth Lead
Varsity Swimmers

Robert Adams and Alan Roth, both
seniors, were elected carcaptains of
the 1933 varsity swimming team, yes—
terday. Both have held berths on the
team for three years, Adams, who set
two new pool records in the 60 and
the 100 yard dashes in the mect with
Creighton university, yestcrday, is 91.
so president of the Forensic club.

Alan Roth has been a consistant
plac
dashes, besides swimming a turn in
the tio.yard relay. He is also a mem-
ber of the Cross Country club,

dent at the Chicago Theological sem-
inary, having church history as his
major interest.

When the professor of church h
tory at the seminary died. the presi—
dent asked the brilliant young Ger-
man to take his place. Dr. Pauck ac.
cepted and has held the position since
then.

stcincr His Student

Among his students, was Richard
sterner, son of Dr. Edward A, Stein-
er, who is taking Dr. steine s place,
as professor of applied Christianity,
during his father's leave of absence.

Dr. Pauck has written one book
”Karl Earth, the Prophet of New
Christianity". This work is a critia
cism of Earth, who is acclaimed “the
most significant of modern thco'c—
glans”.

Wrims History

While not a follower of Barth, Dr 1

Pauck holds certain views in common
with him. Although he is very mod-
ern in many ways, the speaker is no:
strictly a modernist, since he is up-
posed to the humanistic ideas which
are now becoming widespread in
Christendom. He is an out-and~out
theist. At the present time, he is
writing a history of the reformation.

Dr. Pauck is described as an one
tertaining speaker, with a fascinating

,manner of presenting his ideas. At

the conclusion of his lectures to his
classes, the students are said to have
frequently burst into applause.

Coe, Grinnell
Debate Given
Radio Hearing

William Maxcincr and John Poolcy
of Grinnell upheld the negative side
of the question: “Resolved, that 17‘ch
cial legislation should be enacted ems
bodying the principles of the Domes
tic Allotment plm," against Betty
Jenks and Harold Ward of Coe in a
debate over radio station WMT, of
Waterloo, last night at 3:15 o'clock.
Coe Takos Afﬁrmative

The Coe dcbatcrs contended first,
that the Domestic Allotment plan is
necessary. They pointed out the
great growth and prominent place of
farming and the farm home, and then
painted a picture of the present (10»
plorablc condition of the farmer. Thus.
the Coe speaker stated that the allot-
ment plan was an immediate neces»
sity and would be practical.

Pooley attacked the plan, declar-
ing that it is undesirable because it
is discriminatory in’ its workings. He
contended that the plan discrimis
nates against the consumers as a
group and for the producers as a
group: that it also is unfair to many
within the producers group because
only certain products are benefittcd.

Moxcincr Second Speaker

William Maxeiner, second speaker

for Grinnell, contended that the Do-
mestic Allotment plan would not be
lpl'actical. first, he stated, it would be
politically impossible to formulate;
second, the plan would require too
complex an administrative machine,
for each commodity has its own par-
ticular problem; and third, that the
plan is unjust, for it would be a. huge
,sales tax on the consumer's food at a
ltime when his income has been cut
lfrom 50 to 60 per cent.
i The debate was non-dec‘ on, but
,the radio audience was urged to write
to the studio at WMT and the results
of these letters will be announced
,next Friday night from the station.

This is the third radio debate par.
ticipated in this term by Grinnell men

Nets Cowboys
Two Defeats

Grinnell Five Takes Second
Aggie Tilt Friday
24 to 15

By Max Ross

Scoring its second consecutive tri—
umph over the Oklahoma Cowboys,
Grinnell‘s revamped cage team show-
ed local fans something new in the
way of basketball here Friday night.
It was the second time in two nights
that the Pioneers took the measun
of the Aggies, winning 24-15.

 

Concentrating more intensely on
defensive tactics than they have pre.
viously this season, Coach '1‘qu
men set about their task of stopping
the fastvbreaking, smooth blocking
Aggie outfit. They did a pretty effec-
tive job of it, holding the visitors to
five points in the first half and 10 in
the second.
Santi stars

Gaston Santi was the tower in the
path of the Cowboys to the goal. for
be time and time again broke up
plays. not only under his basket
but under his opponents bas-
ket as well. Only a little less
brilliant was the performance of Les
Manns, starting his first game as a
Pioneer regular. Manns proved his
worth by holding his two opponents
scoreless.

It was Santi who led the Pioneer
offensive, as well as taking more than
his share of the defensive burden. He
made good on four out of five free
throws,‘a‘nrl in addition dropped in
two field goals, Mason scored seven
points, and Duncan five,

Take Early Load

Grinnell took an early lead. and at
half time held a 9-5 advantage. The
Aggies made it 12.11 during the sec-
ond half, trailing at that time by only
one point, but the Pioneers took com-
mand and from then on until the gun
sounded the score doubled, while a.
basket and a pair of free throws by
Wade completed the Aggie scoring.
