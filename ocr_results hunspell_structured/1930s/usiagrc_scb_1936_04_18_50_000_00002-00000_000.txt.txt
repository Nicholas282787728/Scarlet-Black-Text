THE (SWELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Reviewer Finds French Plays
as Amusing as English Ones

Two Plays in English,
One in French Given
Last Night

By Carl Niemeycr,
The program of three French
plays, one given in the original and
two in translation, as presented
yesterday evening at the Alumni
Recitation hall auditorium by the
Grinnell players and the French
club, proved that French plays can
be as amusing as English ones.
The program began with “Who
Killed Me?" by Lucien Chantal, a
psychological murder mystery
which. perhaps by intention, moved
a little lngubl‘iously with even the
chief of police (Fletcher Miller)
speaking in melancholy tones, One
felt that the play would have been
more effective had the character-s
read the lines as would ordinary
human beings instead of in so sins
ister a fashion? Ruth Morrison, as
the mistress of the murdered man,
by playing naturally and sincerely
contributed the best piece of work
in the cast

Tristan Bernard-s well known
“L'Anglais tel qu'on le Parlo,"
which was presented in French,
proved as fresh as it always does.
,The diction, if not quite so pure
as Sarah Bernhardt’s. at least did
not make the French hard to un-
derstand, and the acting was so
spirited that one could easily have
forgiven many more faults than
there_wcre. Baughn Johnson as
the interpreter who, knowing only
French. is called upon to deal with
an angry Englishman, knowing on—
ly English, gave to his part a can
taln Gallic spirit rather astonishr
ing in an American undergradu-
‘atte. ;

Mears,

rather than pig-headed. as of
course M. Benlard intended him to
be: but he remained thoroughly
amusing, which after all is most
‘important. Hal Hardin, playing
the part of the young man elop-
ing with “the second of the five
daughters" of the Englishman,
read his lines convincingly.

“Peace at Home" by George
Cour-telinc, with its humorous pres
sentation of the ouarreling hus—
band and wife, sounds. on the face
of it. like the least original of the
three, but the French with their
keen awareness of 'the complexi-
:tles of domestic life have a way
with this kind of thing, and the
play proved very funny.

Take Advantage of Lines.

It was happily cast with Kathr
erine Six as the wire and Leroy
Moore as the author husband. both
of whom took advantage of the
fine lines and situations which the
generous playwright had given
them. Occasionally, no doubt, Miss
Six used her gestures uneconomi»
cally; but the effect of the whole
could not have becn far from what
the author wished it to be

“Who Killed Me 7" was directed
by Harry Duncan: “L'Anglais tel
qu'on le Par-1e” by Elbert Smith of
the French department and “Peace
at Home" by Dorothy Harper.
