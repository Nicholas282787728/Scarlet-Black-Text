Grinnell Splits
Track Contests

Varsity Takes 81-50 Victory

Saturday From Bears;
Frosh Lose, 73-58.

Old Man Dope was only one-half
right in his predictions for the ante
comes of Grinnell's two track teams
last Saturday. The varsity romped
over Washington university in St.
Louis, 81-50, to win as expected, but
a favored freshman team met defeat
at the hands of the state Teachers'
yearling squad at Cedar Falls, 73 to!
53. .

The ﬁrst string men captured ten
first places to the ﬁve that the Bears
were able to garner. The Pioneer
artists also succeeded in taking sev-
eral unexpected ﬁrst places. at the
same time losing ones that had been
considered virtually won. Rainy
weather and a muddy track prevent-
ed brilliance in either track or ﬁeld
events.

Henry Thomas, running the low-
hurdles for the ﬁrst time this season,
eked out a close victory from his
teammate, Ben Hensley. Hensley,
however, won the highrhurdles in ﬁne
style. Howard Mcllrath was the
high score man of the meet. turning
in ﬁrst places in both the mile and
halfemile runs.

The result of the freshman meet
was disappointing. With all other
events nearly even, the Pioneer .frosh
lost out when the Tutors unceremon-
iously slammed the high-jump, dis-
cus, shot-put, polervault and the low-
hurdles.

Harold Alexander. Grinnell dash
man, was high scorer with thirteen
‘points. He won ﬁrst places in the
century and 220-yard dashes, and a

AND speaking of tasty
things for gifts! I made
a little tour this morning and
found the headquarters for all
good things!
‘ I entered the door and cast
my eyes upon the best look
ing compacts. A girl would
be thrilled to get any of them.
Lucretia Vanderbilt's double
is my favorite, I believe. It
is so handy in size and shape.
But dears, if it shouldn't
please there are many others
to choose from. Darling
round onesiand oh! Harriet
Hubbard Ayl'e's “complete"
compact is a whiz! Every-
thing in it to make you look
like a million.

I TURNED around a wee

, bit and found myself cons
fr nted with diaries! They
aren't ordinary. either. Don't
you wonder what the next
ﬁve years will bring? That
friend of yours is wondering
too. After ﬁve years what
fun it will be to read those
"Linea Day" books. And
then for that vacation trip
while one of those ﬁve years
is speeding by, when a line
a day isn’t sufficient—I sug-
gest the travel book. Adven»

and Books, You know too
what satisfaction a lovely

umes of the poems of'Poe.
Keats, Byron. and Burns.
What heaven to pick up one
of these on a quiet evening
and revel in their mystery!

AND lastly I came to a

counter gaily docked with
stationery. All kinds of it
and so pretty. Why not give
it to that friend of yours that
you want a lot of letters
from? I'm sure that the
hint would work. It is such
full to write long letters on
lovcly stationery.

It is difficult to»buy a gift
for a'tellow—one that he will
surely like; but I'm sure you
couldn't get anything in this
place that he wouldn't be
crazy about. Leather goods
may seem banal. 7 but you
should see these pieces! Trav-
eling cases, either outfitted
or not. Letter portfolios, bill
folds and letter cases, they
couldn't help but please.
I Now wandered over to the
fountain pen case case. It
is so much fun to wander
around hereinew delights at
every turn But I mustn't
get too excited about my fun
—eI'll have to tell you about
the snappy Conklin Endura
Ensembles. They are grand
and write perfectly. Have
you seen these? A pen on
one endish—and a pencil on
the other Isn't that keen?
‘o more ineffectual searches
for the penci —it will always
be there. You'll adore these
ensembles ,. either for your-
self or the friend.
