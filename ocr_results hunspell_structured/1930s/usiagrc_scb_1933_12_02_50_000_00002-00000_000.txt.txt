REORGANIZATION

An interesting discussion took place a few
days ago ill one of the prominent campus Ol'gill
tions. The meeting was faced witll the baffling
problem, “Why ill the world was tllis organization
established? \Vhat is its fullCtion?” OF course no
one knew thc' answ, , but. it tool: little time to
establish the fact tllat the group should be main
mined and should find something to do.

Once this group had been very prominent,
alld now that 'it sccmcd to be losi its validity,
something should be done to revive i S me there
was nothing naiting to be done, it “as decided
that the group could lcg aill its prestige by stic ,
ing its finger ill anything it could find.” and this
policy was established.

Another organization was faced with the Same
problem, found there was 110 charter available to
dctelmine polic ' alld started to look for ﬁlings
that needed doiu It started 11011: on onc or the
plojects only to discover tllat another g1 oup was
alleady doing the same thing.

Several members of the Student Council have.
come to the conclusion that even the council itself
has outlived its usefulness. Whether 01' not this
is true, at,lcast there seems to he a real necessity
for reorganization of campus organizations, alld
it may be hopod that the present discussion of stu-
dent government will lead to real action.

GRACIAS

Students who remained ill Grinncll for their
Thanksgiving dinner have declared the meal served
Thursday at the college to be an example of the
height of culinary arts. Credit must be given to
those ill charge, including l 133 Anne E. Smith,
house director; Mrs. Elhcl Miller, in charge of the
men’s dining room, and dormitory and quadrangle .
cooks, for the abundance of good food, tastily pl'cs
pared

Incidentally, Thanksgiving means little to the
average blase college student except :1 vacation or
:1 turkey dinner, As a matter of fact, it would cer-
tainly do no harm, if.on one day ill the yer , 'tus
dents were a bit thankful for their opportnnltics
and their environment in a world which treats the
vast majority of its people with cruelty and coil-
tempt.

FOOTBALL RECOVERY ACT

Today closed onc of the most successful foot-
ball seasons that thc collegiatc sport has enjoyed
ill a number of ycars. Not only has competition
throughout the coulltl'v been unusually keen and
receipts better than at ally timc during the last
few ycals, but the cr ' 5 who have been so sex crc-
ly ccnsurillg thc ” ovc empha, s” of the spolt
llavc subsided ill their wailing.

Many schools faced with falling attendance
at their grid games, upon nllich their whole sports
programs dcpcndcd, in desperation reduced ad-
lllission p1iccs with the hope of increasing the size
of the crowds The plan prov ed to be a capital
one, alld vcl'y fcw of the institutions which took
thi stcp were disappointed with the result . Fa-
Vorcd by fine weather during most of the scason,
record crowds gathered each Saturday ill the many
huge stadia throughout the country, crowds which
meant ill lsed returns to the athletic depart-
ments despite the lower admi. ion charges.

Falling in with the football “recovery pro-
gram,” competition was close ill all but one or two
of the major cmll'crcnccs, alld the season saw any
number of supposedly i11vin"blc clcvcns l'udcly
dethroned by “dal'lohol'sc 77’1“ of which did
much to renew pulll into The clcsc of thc
Season finds only lhrc major teams ill the comb
try undefeated alld unticd, and two of those, Army
and Duke, encountcr foes 1oday who may cause
a further depletion of thc ran The grid , rug-
glc on the west coast was so bitter that even tllc
team selected to represent that section ill the an—
nual Tournament of Roses, has one dcfcat and one
1ic on its record.

By no means least important among the fac-
tors u‘blch made the past season a succc 1 was the
absence of criticism alld , andal in the r. llcgialc
football circles Apparently the rule Chang ' ef-
fected to make the game less dangerous were sues
cessful, since the deaths resulting from activities
on the gridiron were so few that they drew prac-

tically no comment. \Vith no grounds for Criticism
hcrc, the “over-cmpllasis addicts” would no doubt
have lnado the most of it had ally schools bccn
charged with sub. dizing players, but even this
opening was denied them.

it would seem that the Football Recovery Act
has beau successful lo an amazing dcrrrcc, which
not only incan. great deal to the gridiron sport
ilscll‘. but cvcll ll\0|'L' to the minor sports and intra-
lunlal proglams which drpcnd upon the great fall
sport for their c 'stcllco.

GRINNELL HAS GOOD SPORTS
(Daily 0' Collegian)

Arising with a fearful headache from a nightmare
of football which gave them not one victory, Grinnell
collegiate's, Grinnell, Ion/a, are looking with unusual
antioipaticni toward other sports. one would judge from
looklng at a recent issue of Scarlet and Black.

Very few stories on the front page are not directly
concerned with the basketball prospect. There is a
streamer headline about the first practice, a basket-
ball tournament story, a photograph of the head basket-
ball coach, a photograph of the cage captain, besides a
story on letters to football players and two stories on
girls' hockey. Good sports, those pioneers.

OPTIONAL ATTENDANCE
(Rutgers Tar-gum)

Finally optional attendance at academic classes has
become a reality for seniors. It is not just a theoretical
question but an educational philosophy being placed
under the hard trial of practical experimentation.

Theoretically, the unlimited cut plan is supported
by a mass of educational philosophy. Its ultimate result
is to put more and more responsibility upon the student
for his conduct. taking away the obligations of faculty
and administration along this line, except in certain
extreme cases. Apparently there can he no harm in
shifting this responsibility to the student while he is
still an undergraduate and while he may learn by the
trial and sum method without serious repercussion
One of the worst jolts to our college graduates is the
transition‘ from reliance on others, which might have
pulled them through college. to self- responsibility, a
primary requisite in the business world.

LITVINOFF Ah HIS MISSION
(Oberlin Review)

Maxim Litvlnoff, foreign minister of the U. s. s. R,
who came to Washington at the invitation of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt to negotiate for the recognition
of Soviet Russia, fulfilled a commission of Lenin which
had to wait fifteen years—a commission which be him-
self has been most anxious to execute,

Lenm, in the hectic summer of 1913, in the midst
of bloodshed and levolution in Russia, was hoping for
recognition of the newly hem Bolshevik state He de-
su‘ed a diplomatic representative in the United States
and selected an almost unknown revolutionary journal-
ist, Maxim Litv'moff by name, to be the first Soviet
ambassador in Washington. All these hopes came to
naught after President Woodrow Wilson decided there
was no reason for a Bolsevik ambassador in this coun»
try, and Lenin’s commission was left unexecuted.

Litvinot‘f arrived for his first visit to the United
States heralded as the most successful diplomat in
Europe today. He has held his official position for
fifteen years, and, while other European statesmen have
come and gone, he has skillfully carried out his foreign
policies which have enabled the Soviet Union to take
its place among the powers of Europe and to establish
itself internally as a modern industrialized country. In
less than a decade and a half, he and his predecessor,
Grigory Chicherin, have won recognition from more
than twenty-four governments, so that recognition by
the United States how will be but the climax to an
already brilliant career. At the world Economic Con-
ference at London he created a sensation by making a
plea to end World depression by total cessation of eco-
nomic warfare, and offered a treaty of economic hon-
aggression which all nations were to sign. To prove the
sincerity of the Soviet policy he signed non-aggression
treaties with ten countries, a step which brought the
total of such treaties to fourteen in the last two years.

Born in Bialystok, Russian Poland, on July 17, 1876,
Litvinoff is today fifty—seven. He comes of middle 01355
Stock; his father was a bank manager. Plump, stocky,
with keen gray-green eyes peering through horn-rimmed
spectacles, he looks not unlike a German professor. He
prefers oldrfasllioncd formal European dress—wing
collar and pillrstrlped trousers. By nature a quiet eon-
servative man he has always been on the less violent
Side of Russian politics, although he has been in the
inner circle of Soviet leaders since the beginning of the
Communist party in Russia.

That is the story of the soviet apostle of peace.
whose direct and open diplomacy has shocked European
embassies; that is the man who is opening the prospect
of a huge new world market as a solution for the prob-
lem of over-production; and those are a tow aceornpl h-
ments of the man who was received as the first; ofﬁ Ell
representative of Russia since the World Wan Maxim
Litvmoff must stand as the living example of the new
Russian diplomacy.
