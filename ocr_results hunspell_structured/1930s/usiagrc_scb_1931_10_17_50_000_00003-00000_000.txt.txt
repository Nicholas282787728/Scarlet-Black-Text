Library Places
20 New Books ‘
on Rental Shelr

Like “Young Man of Manhattan"
Katherine Brush’s latest novel. “Red
Headed Woman." is cleverly written.
The story is merely a means for pre»
senting Lillian Legendre, the beauti-
ful, redrheaded little animal out for
all she can get and determined to get
a lot.

She was one of the many women
born without a background, but un-
like the average woman she set out
to get one in the person of young,
hearty William Legendre, only son of
a millionaire citizen of Renwood.

The picture which is portrayed of
the red-head at her first dinner party
is pathetic and yet humerous. This
penetrating, modern comedy is light,
satirical reading.

This novel is only one of the 20
new rental books on library shelves.
Among them are “The sniny Night"
by Beatrice Tons-tall, ”The Volga
Falls to the Caspian Sea" by Boris
Pilnyak, “A White Bird Flying" by
Beth Streeter Aldrich, "The Bridge
of Desire" by Warwick Deeping,
“Post Mortem" by Noel Coward,
“Fed Up" by George Birmingham,
and “Shadows on the Rock” by Willa
Cather.

“Mexico” by Stewart Chase, “Mys
tery in the English Channel” by F.
w. Crofts. ”Hatters Castle" by A.
J. Cronin, “Murder in the Willett
Family" by Rufus King, “Seven
Days" by Andreas Latsko, "Dwarfs
Blood" by Edith Oliver, “Brothers in
the West" by Robert Reynolds, “Can
You Hear Their Voices" by Hallie
Flannigan, “F‘inch‘s Fortune” by
Marc la Roche, and “Susan Spray”
by Shellie Kaye-Smith.

New Members

News Board Selects Six;

Editorial Four

New members of the news and edi—
torial staffs of The Scarlet and Black

extending over seven issues.

Six new members, including two
men and four women. were admitted
to the news Staff. The men elected
were James Moore and Malcolm
Thompson. Women chosen were Ruth
Bender, Marjorie Schuchert, Mary
Wood, and Elizabeth Herron.

The number of members of the am
torlal hoard has been increased from
seven to eight, and as a result of
this change, four new members were
elected for positions on the board.
John Jeffries, Miriam Spaulding,
William Pryor, and Harley Stipp

Frosh Hold Limelight
During “Prep Days”

Freshmen rule Crinnell college this
weekend, comic reign though it may
be. From the opening of “prep day"
activities Friday morning through
the annual class scrap this afternoon,
the yearlings have held the center of
the stage here.

Ridiculous regnlia. juvenile suits,
white overalls, and plaid skirts were
seen on the campus and about the
city Friday and Saturday. Students
in classes Friday heard the regular
calling of the time by the watchman
pacing the street in front of Alumni
Recitation hall, and the ﬁrst floor
hall received its annual scrubbing
with a toothbrush. other freshmen
spent Friday afternoon guarding the
coeds of the quadrangle, doing pre-
sent arms when one of the women
appeared.

The Coe-Grinnell freshman football
game last night was appropriate to
the program of freshman activities,
and the Honor G club gave out the
scarlet and black freshman caps bar
tween halves.

The freshman-sophomore class
battle, in the form of a tug-of-war
this afternoon, climaxed the series of
events.
