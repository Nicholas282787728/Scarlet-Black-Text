Alumni Group fo
Boosf "Grinnell
Commonwealth"

The Gn‘nnell alumni association
is working on its campaign to re
rive interest in the “Grinnell Com~
moltwealth” this year.

Plans were made last year to
krrrt the "Commonwealth" into a
unified group pulling together for
the good of the college.

The “Grinnell Commonwealth"
includes the present student body,
alumni, and friends and beneface
tors of the college.

“While we do hope to raise
money through our alumni Clubs,”

explained Robert. Y. Kerr, execu-

tive secretary, “our main purpose
at present is to get the three parts
of the ‘Commonwealth' working
together."

There are about 7,500 alumni in
the United States, 3,000 of them
being in Iowa, 600 in California,
475 in Illinois, 400 in Nebraska,
continuing on down to one in south
Carolina.

The strongest chapters of the
alumni association are found in
New York and Chicago. A large
chapter is also in southern Cali~
fornia, but covers more territory
than most of the chapters.

Unsuspecting
Studes Targets
of Camera Seige

By Nancy Mchirirrny

Flashrciick! Eek: And before the
unsuspecting studcs know what it
is all about, George Fletcher has
recorded their pans for posterity.

This sort of thing has been go-
ing on since the double-doors of
old Crinnell opened half way to
admit the new crop and the re—
turning students.

lt has kept the cameraman
busier than the girl—friend of the
whirling dervisli, and even the
rest of the usually phlegmatic
student body is known to be on
its collective toes, since the epi-
of photography-onvavbig-
scale has hit the campus.

Latest weather reports have it
that thenew wave of clicks and
flashes has all the force of a Cyr
clone behind it and advise the be-
leagnred photographers to dig in
for a long siege,

The feminine side of the tracks
would do well to lay in a supply
of glare-proof powder—nothing
like being prepared!

In the meantime, the flash-gun-
ning and camera-clicking wrll
continue until the Cyclone staff
reaches the unholy goal of a can—
did shot of every student on the
campus; so watch yourselves,
kids!
