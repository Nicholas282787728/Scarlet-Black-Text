four thought that in time of war

should be sold to all countries im-

Survey Finds
S’rudem‘ Body
Desires Change

A committee composed of six
men and three women has been
selected to propose a plan to be
submitted to the students and
faculty in regard to a change in
the system of conducting examin—
ations.

The committee consists of Fred
erick Homann, Robert Hagan. and
Robert Schutt from Friars: Alice
Meacham and Carolyn Bludclm of
Mortar Board; William Pedersen,
Student Council; Jerry Eort. Hon—
or "G”; Jean Hill. League Board
and Harry Kies. council of House
Residents.

Group to Make Shady.

The group will study the tabu-
lated returns of the questionnaire
sent out by the Friars. Mortar
Board, and the student council,
which found that a decided ma-
jority of the men in school were
in favor of a change in the meth—
od of conducting examinations.

The women, however. were
about evenly divided on the same
proposal. the report showed.
Proctor System Rejected.

Both sides of the campus voted
an overwhelming "no" in reply
to the question of a prootoring
system. Most students felt that if
an honor system were established
there should be a student discip- '
linary body in charge.

The last question. which re-
quested original suggestions, evok-
ed a number of varied replies.
Scine advocated the use of “moral
suaslon,” while others asked that
the problem be solved by simply
not grading the examination pea
pers.

Student Suggestions.

One student suggested that
classes should walk out en masse
when a cribber is detected. The
ideas in use among other schools
were cited in some answers. The
“pencil tapping" method at stan-
ford university. and the “freeze
out” system in use at Washington
and Lee university were named
as being two which are in suc-
cessful practice,

The poll was conducted with no
definite proposals in view. the
committee announced; but due to
the interest it provoked on the
campus. the special committee
was chosen and will be asked to
study the results and incorporate
them into a plan to be submitted
to the students and faculty.
