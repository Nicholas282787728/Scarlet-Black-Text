Last Minute
Rally Beats
Coe 33-32

Mason, Frye Sink Baskets
to Provide Winning

Margin

Although obviously tired from the
lowa State game of the night before,
the Pioneer cagers, improving
through—out the game, came from be.
bind in the last minutes of the game
to win from Coe 33 to 32 Saturday
night.

The Kohawks set the pace most of
the way, and although the Pioneers
caught them late in the first period,
the half.time score was 15 to 14 in
favor of Coe. In spite of the loss of
Bauer, who left the game on fouls,
and Oliphant, who was injured, the
Pioneers staged a late rally, resulting
in baskets by Frye and Mason, to
take a one point lead just before the
gun sounded.

Mason High Scorer

Scoring honors for the evening went
to Captain Mason, who contrihuted
seven of his teams 12 field goals, Du
Mont followed with two field goals
and six free throws for a total of 10
points Keith was leading Kohawk
scorer with three field goals and two
free tosses.

The jumping of Bradley.
guard who entered the game at center
in the final minutes, was said by
Coach John C. Trucsdole to have been
a vital factor in the Pioneer victory.
With Coe several points in lead, Brad—
ley controlled the tips“, giving his
team mates the ball. and enabling
them to stage their final scoring spree.

Unusual Stamina

Unusual stamina was shown by the
Pioneers, according to Coach Trues—
dale, who pointed out that the effects
of the previous night’s game gradu.
ally wore off, so that the cagers gained
in strength as the game progressed

Oliphant, forward, injured his ankle
during the last half, but should be
ready to play when the squad re»as_
sembles after its holiday, Truesdale
stated.

Free Throws Win

Since each team made 12 field goals,
the Pioneer advantage resulted from
the fact that they converted nine out
of 13 chances from the free dlmw line,
while Coe made good on eight out of
lo tries.

The Pioneer squad will disband Fri.
day, returning to Grinnell on Dec. :11,
when they will resume practice for a

Staff Statistician Produces
Amazing Estimates

on Fag Trade

By STAFF STATISTICIAN

Many cons ago the original statis—
tiwian laid end to end a bunch of
fellows he’d just bashed in the head
with a stone hammer and Inund out
it was a lot of fun. Ever since, this
has been the most distinctive function
of statisticians; they have laid every.
thing imaginable end to end that is
almost everything. I believe it is my
privilege to be the first to align in
this manner a year’s crop of cigaret
stubs abandoned by lady and gentle.
men smokers of the Gl‘innell college
student body. The result is—stand
back, you “bird" Snatchers—a Stub
three and seven»eighths miles long!
What's more, I have the iigulcs to
prove lt—m say nothing of a dozen
more stupendous statistics which will
amaze you to no end.

How It Slnrtctl

My curiosity was aroused one day
when I saw two guys all but come to
blows over an extra—long "bird” which
some wasteful co-ed tossed away in
the College shop. Asking the pro—
prietors how many fags the shop sold
per week, 1 was—to put it mildly—-
nonplussed to hear them say that 430
packs is about the average sale. Know.
ing‘ that the College Shop rates aboul
half the college cigaret trade, but. Iig.
uring my informants were probably
in a state of semi»asphyxlal.ion from
the nicotine fog hanging over the
premise and therefore not respons.
ible, 1 carried the investigation furth.

510 More Packs

Lat-os’ Cigar store estimated its
weekly cigaret sale kl college trade
at 200 packs, while five other esmb—
lishmcnl‘s selling cigal‘em to college
trade reported a weekly demand of
from a carton and a half to five earn
tons; various and sundry eating places
and "liquid—refreshment" parlors were
accredited with another 20 packsi
and there were 510 more per week!

Convinced by n‘OW that the original
estimate, by the College Shop, had
not been over-ambitious I grabbed
pencil and paper and proceededaso
to speaka lay the stubs end to end,
with previously mentioned astounding
results. Then and there I was oifi
figuratively speaking. One flabber.
gusting statistic after another reeled
off my pencil. Below I submit the
cream of the croktake 'em or leave

The entire school consumes 19,300

the other hand, every Grinnell stu~

the time spent in smoking, the total
bill would amount to nearly $30,000
each school year~and the boys and
gals would smoke even more than
they do now, no doubt.

50 Per Com Women

Nearly all of the establishments
which sell cigarets to college trade
reported that a good so per cent of
the sales are to women. And it would
