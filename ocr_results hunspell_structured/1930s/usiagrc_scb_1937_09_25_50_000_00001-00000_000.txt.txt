Cole, Purple End, Spoils
Season's Inaugural for

Grinnell Squad
By Wells Barnett

Grinnell’s Pioneers lost their
season opener here Thursday to
the Purple from Cornell by a 6-0
score, as a gent by the name of
Franklin Cole, 159—pound end,
bought himself a season pass in
the Grinnell backfield and stayed
there most of the evening.

This Cole plays about the most
unorthodox style you ever saw. He
lines up on defense somewhere
in the backfield, starts to sprint
with the shift and hits the line
of scrimmage just when the hall
is snapped. He is an uncanny di-
ayiostican of opposition pla s.
and the combination of this ahi ty
and the speed with which he
gets into action proved the Pit)»
neer’s undoing.

Grinnell kicked off, but Core
neli kicked bach on first down,
and the Pioneers started to
ramble. The first two plays
netted a first down, out Grinnell
was penalized for too much time,
and fumbled on the next play.
This combination of circumstanc—
es proved unnerving to the Pio-
neers, and after an exchange of
kichs. cole blocked one of Hay-
Ward’s punts, which rolled out of
hounds in Cornell’s possession.

the touchdown,

The rest of the second half
proved to he nothing more than

Relation of Students and
Faculty Cited; Flag
Raising Opens Year

The relation of Grinnell spirit
between the faculty and the ad
ministration and between the stu—
dents and the faculty, was the
topic stressed by Dr. Edward A.
Steiner, professor of Applied Chris
tianity, who spoke on "Campus
immortality" at an all-college
convocation in Herrick chapel,
Thursday morning.

The convocation preceded the
customary flag»raising ceremony
on the campus, officially opening
the school year. Dr Steiner was
substituting for Pres. John S. Nol-
len, who was unable to attend be-
cause of illness.
Spirit ol Grinueﬂ

Dr. Steiner's feeling was that
the spirit of Grinnell must be
maintained at all times, for spirit
is the thing that distinguishes
Grinnell from other colleges and
universities.
