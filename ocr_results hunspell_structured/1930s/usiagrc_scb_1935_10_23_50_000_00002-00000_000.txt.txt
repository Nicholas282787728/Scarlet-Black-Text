Honor G to Close
Advance Ticket
Sale Saturday

“Advance ticket sales for the
annual Honor G Homecoming
dance, at which Carl (Deacon)
Moor-L. will play, will definitely
close at noon Saturday," Eugene
Klepfer, president of the men's
honor organization, declared last
night.

“After that the price will be
$2.00. at the door, instead of
the price of sun, which is being
asked during the advanced sale,"
he stated.

“We think that this will be one
of the biggest and best dances of
the fall semester if not of the en-
tire year,” Klepfer asserted. ”We
are working hard trying to put
this thing over, and we would like
to have the student body cooperate
and get their tickets early."

Decorations for the dance win
carry out the traditional scarlet
and black theme with a false ceil-
ing of streamers approximately a
foot apart being used to change the
men’s gymnasium, where the dance
is to be held, Klepfer said yester~
day.

The dance will probably start
at 9 or 9:15 o'clock, depending ups
on how soon the Cornelia Otis
Skinner recital lets out.

New Yoi'k7(ACP)7Harold Jos-
iirun '37, Columbia university stu-
dent who attracted wide attention
last year when he instituted a
“wakmgup” service for his fellow
sudents, is back this year full of
determination to expand his novel
business.

“I'm all set for a big season," he
lconfided to our reporter. “I've al-
ready got a lot of customers, and
my new method of getting them
up never fails,"

The new method proved to be a
phial of ammonium chloridc, prev-
iously treated with sodium hydrox-
,ide to obtain the gas, A few whiffs
of this and the patient is wide
lawake It never fails, and besides,
l

 

“it clears the head immediately,"
according to Jcsiirnn.

i He also gave an inkling of the
,novcl means he used to promote

"Fernando del Rio set, his alarm
clock for 6:30 a. m. I sneaked in
when hc was asleep and put it
ahead to 5:30. When he failed to
‘awakcn on time the next morning,
l1 pointed out to him the unreli»
ability of alarm clocks, and told
lhim how foolish it was to depend
on such erratic devices. ‘He finally
saw the light, and del Rio is now
one of the numerous JesuI‘un satis.
fied Customers."

In like thisefour BMOC (big

men on campus) have pooled their|
charm to make it easier for the
campus girls to date them, They
accept applications for a date from
any girl provided she will furnish
the money. The remainder will
come from the menitheir pres-
tige, charm, their own cars and
the evening's good time.
We do not know whether the
boys retain the option of submits
ting an expense account after the
party.

”Hills Not Everlasting’.’
Scientist Declares

Worcester, Mass 7 MC?) 7
Poets and others who talk about
the everlasting hills" may not be
strictly accurate, according to Dr.
Wallace Atwood, president of Clark
imivcrsity here, who says that re
cent geological research indicates
that three Rocky Mountain ranges
have formed and worn away dur-
ing the last 30 million years.
“Three distinct ranges of moun-
tains," he said, “have come into ex-
istence and passed away since the
formations which we know as the
Rocky Mountains began."
No exact determination of the
height of the ancient mountains
can be made, Dr. Atwood said, but
they were probably higher than the
present peaks.

COLLEGIATE WORLD

Charles Darwin spent eight
years dissecting over menu bar-
nicles. He became interested in
the structure of one species, and
because of erroneous knowledge
and lack of information proceeded
to do this great work.

Announcement of the discovery
of a red-tailed hawk new to
science was made at Cornell uni-
versity recently by Dr. George M.
Sutton, curator of birds at the uni~
versity.
