COLLEGIATE REVIEW.

The Garyear-old freshman, Jules
Lebegue, who enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Illinois in February, has
left school to help his son on the
farm. “Getting rid of the rust
and puting on a little polish" is
still his policy, for he is studying
hy correspondence.

If a mathemati an were to split
hairs with statisticians at the
University of Minnesota. he could
probably prove them a pound or
two off in their computation that
barbers in the Union building clip
almost 100 pounds of black, yel—
low, white. brown and‘ auburn
leeks yearly.

Senior Women Inaugurate Trend
Towards Intellectual Stimulus

Higher, More Practical
Discussion Sought
by New Group

There IS a new trend toward in-
tellectual stimulus on the Griiiiiell
campus, judging from the efforts
of several senior woincn to estab
lish an organization in pursuit of
higher and more practical discus-
am.

“We don’t just want to talk
about babies and bridge after
we're mal'rictliwe want to be in:
tellectual!" is their cry.

To Meet at Dinner

Inspired by Dr. Edward A.
Steiner and the Book of Amos,
Rita Phelps, Jeanne McElmvy,
and Francelia Smith have decided
to form a discussion group which
will meet at dinner two nights a
weelt to talk over current economr
ic. political, and scientific affairs.
It is not a closed corporation and
they will invite nine other women

 

”I I
to participate at each meeting,

Discussion of dates and campus

‘ affairs is taboo, but the converse-

tion ranges from facts concerning
sit-down strikes to the Oriental
philosophy in "Lost Horizonn
Table Head Directs

The table head directs the cone
versation which is very argu-
mentative, and squelches any per»
son who mentions a subject that
is out of date. There is no Come
pulsory attendance. but the group
must be notified in order to keep
the nine places filled

Their purpose is to cltangc the
limited field of quadrangle hull

:sessions from dates, sex, and so
forth, to the wider field of timely

events.

LLEN To see K

Pres. John s. Nollen will speak
on the progress of the college be-
fore a group of crlnnell college
alumni at a supper meeting to be
held Sunday evening in Des Moines
at the home of Mr. and Mrs, Gel“
