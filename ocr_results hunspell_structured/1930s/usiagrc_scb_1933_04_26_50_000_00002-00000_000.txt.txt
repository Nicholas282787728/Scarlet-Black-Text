SEMESTER FEES

The Grinncll student council, including both
new and retiring members, willmcet again to con
sitler allottiucnt semester fees Sunday, May 7.
At tllat time it will be decided whether or not it is
advisable to out other departments in order to fl~
name a swimmingI schedule next year.

Before that time, much investigation must be
done by the committee appointed by the new pres
ident of the council. In order to determine fairly
whether any of the departments can stand cuts
and still function properly, the problems of rc-
ductions ill number aild class of talent must be
considered.

We believe, however. that the small cost of
the Swimming schedule can certainly be borne by
an appropriation from the semester fee. From
our understanding, Coach Rosen’s salary does not
enter into the question, but can be taken care of
ill another manner. Proceeds from the Brown
Derby drag will also go toward establishing a
“swimming fund,” so the total percentage to be
derived from semester fee allottments should be
very low.

Some students favor cutting recital and lec-
turc numbers to a minimum, It is possible that
these departments could exist on less money by
presenting fewer numbers during the year, and
this would be favorable to a majority of students,
we believe, but the quality of the programs should
In no way be lowered, As for the apportionment
of two per cent of the fees to the conference on
International Relations, we believe that lh :laiu
speaker at this convention should supplant the of
the speakers on th lecture course if his expenses
are paid by the school, and thus a Saving will be
effected.

\Vhatevcr is done. students should be vitally
interested in the outcome. T'Tou'cvc before at-
taching the council’s actions or spreading pl’opar
ganda, they should be certain that all of the facts
of the matter are clear to thcin.

REFERENCE BOOKS

Those responsible for the installation of hall
librari - in the various men's halls have done a
splendid scrvice to the students, and they can not
be complimcnted too highly, The list of titles of
the books to be loaned by the college library shows
a wellrbalanccd selection of biographies, histories,
poems, and fiction. so wisely chosen that the hall
librari , are bound to be well patronized.

To make these individual libraries all that
they should be, however, it remains for the indiv-
idual halls to purchase a few of the type of vol-
umes known as reference books, All unabridged
dictionary, an encyclopedia, and perhap a copy
of “Who's Who” would save many a trip to the
library alld be a permanent assct to each hall.

_ Gﬁ
THOSE SENIOR EXAMS

answer to the yearly plea for no senior c
aminations, the faculty always says that they are
necessary to determine the standing of a few tu-
(lcnts who arc on tho border line between passing
and failing. We admit that is necessary, but why
subject the others to examinations that are mere
formalities?

Could not a compromise be reached in which
A and B students, and even possibly (l students,
would be used from taking the finals. Surely
those students are well enough versed in their
course not to gain lunch addcll knowledge from
what , lldy they might do in preparation for lie
nal‘ Tentative senior grades are in bcfo my
inatioil time. Let those grades dctcrmiilc who
shall be out sed from taking the tests.

EDUCATION’S CASH VALUE
(Oregon Emerald Daily)

The “Cash" value of education has been carefully
computed by Dean E. 1 Lord, Boston University busi-
ness expert, who calculates that every hour spent 7“
college . worth $10 to the individual. This will prove
somewhat startling information to the thousands of
college graduates throughout the land who are looking
hleakiy for jobs; looking [or any kind of work at all.
They likewise Will be interested to know how to cash
in on the $10 an hour coming to them.

Don't write Dean Lord, however. His answer prob<
ably would be as useless as our advice. His statistics
concern the average and since we have only ourselves
with which to deal, the commercial success or failure
that we make of our lives is not compensated by the
successes and failures of our colleagues.

Statistics will prove most anyLllmg. That the aver»
age college graduate will have earned $150,000 by the
time he reaches 60 does not necessarily mean that his
colleae education has given him this earning capacity.
In all probability he would have earned a good share of
it anyway. Anyone capable of doing college work
represents the upper percentage of the country‘s in—
telligence. Colleges are fortunate in lacing able to edu-
cate the best material.

This is not meant to imply that we doubt the
value of college education, but we do believe that its
commercial aspects are greatly over-emphasized. The
value of a college education cannot be measured in a
commercial sense alone. It is our belief that when this
side is stressed, it means the breakdown of any true
system of education. The intangible values far exceed
any that can he computed in dollars and eents.

.s VITAL QUESTION
(St. Norbert Times)

It seems to be a common discussion among the
more earnest college students whether a college educa-
tion is worth while and at the same time just how much
a graduate is expected to know. This' question is im~
portant. Even the most conscientious student doubts
at times whether he is doing justice to himself or if he
has fallen below what: should be expected.

Owen D, Young in a recent news publication gives
a group of five queries which he believes form a stator
dard guiding questionnaire for students doubtful in re-
gard to this matter. They follow:

"First. Have you enlarged your knowledge of ob—
ligations and increased your capacity to perform them?

“Second. Have you developed your intuitions and
made more sensitive your emotions?

“Third. Have you discovered your mental attitude?

“Fourth. Have you learned enough about the ma-
chinery of society and its history to enable you to ap-
ply your gift effectively?

“Fifth. Have you acquired adequate skill in com»
munication with others 7"

Can you give a satisfactory answer to these ques-
tions to your own self? In this matter we must be our
own judges and if we are not able to answer these vital
concepts, something important still remains to be ac-
quired,

OFF THE GOLD STANDARD
(Daily Northwestern)

Was Europe caught napping? Did Uncle Sam pull
a fast one on European financial experts? Well, the
turtle of Aesop's Fables passed up the sleeping rabbit.

England, Germany, France, and Great Britain
seemed to have forgotten that the U. S. was far from
being in a dormant condition, that we had a lot of tricks
left up our sleeve. And so, on the eve of Madam Pros-
peritie's return, when England had begun to work out
a. plan whereby she could go back to the gold standard,
President Roosevelt issued a proclamation to the effect
that America had deserted the Gold Standard. England
was stunned, France gasped, and all of Europe paused
for a moment to take count of the situation They
could hardly believe that we were capable of pulling
anything as daring and clever at such an opportune
moment.

Now just what does it mean? - About a year ago,
Great Britain went off the gold standard, because, she
claimed, her gold had been drained mm the coffers at
an alarming rate. Then we sat back and witnessed the
fall of the pound sterling in the world money market
which, of course, gave England a most strategic trade
position. She was sitting on top of the heap competing
for all the world markets and getting them because of
a deflated pound. She was able to undersell most any
large competitor while the United States sat on a trunk
packed with ideas but no spunk. We saw prospective
markets for our goods dwindle to nothing. Thus have
we viewed the deepening depression for the past year.

At last we took the initiative and made a bold
move to compete for these same markets which Great
Britain so nobly took from us. And Great Britain has
the audacity to become angered at our move.

STORE IT \‘VITH THE BUGGY
(Daily Trojan)

Having Victoriously sung the swan song of the
Lame Duck congress, Sen. George W. Norris is not
content to rest upon his laurels, but has now started
a bitter attack on the antiquated electoral college sys—
tem for selecting the president of the United states.
Long an originator of progressive legislation, Senator
Norris is to be complimented on his latest efforts and
we sincerely hope that his new measure will meet with
the same success as did his Lame Duck bill.

While the old electoral college had a purpose in
former years as it really chose the president and vice-
presiuent, application of new and modem means of
communication have changed conditions so that the
college is nothing more than an unnecessary expense
in government. It. really accomplished nothing in this
day, but might sometime provide an opportunity for
some crooked political maneuvering.

Now the electoral collegc is nothing more than a
formality, a custom that has outlived its use like the
horse and buggy. The designated membeis meet to
open the sealed election returns forwarded under author.
ity of the various state governments and solemnly reach
the decision that the nation has elected a new adminis-
tration, a conclusion that the nation had reached long
before.

Senator Norris maintains that the abolition of the
electoral college would permit a “truer expression of
the people's will.” The reintroduction of this bill is one
proof that constructive political thinking can be done
in trying times. While every effort is being made to cut
down unnecessary governmental expense, the electoral
eollge might well be considered as one of the first items
in this class.

Four-Mile Relay Team
Places Third at Kansas

With three of its members run-
ning slower mile stretches than
their averages in practice sessions,
the Grinnell four-mile relay team
finished in third place at the annual
Kansas relays held at Lawrence
Saturday.

A crock team from the Universir
ty of Indiana chalked up the time
of 17, minutes 54.2 Seconds to place
first, while University of Illinois
took second place.

Art Mollrath, lead-off man, ran
one of his best miles to stay up in
the money. Pfeiffer, Gordon, and
Pilbrow, however, according to re-
ports from the meet, misjudged
their pace and did not equal their
average practice times.
