YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK

If the attitude now prevalent among the
next Friday remains unchanged, the whole affair
students in regard to the trial dateless cut-dance
is doomed from the start to be just another “noble
experiment." The possibility of cooperating with
the Student Council in the matter in a genuine
endeavor to make the dance a success has not,
apparently, even occured to most of the men and
women on the campus. In most cases the whole
matter seems to have been dismissed with the
remark, “It’ll never work.”

And of course it won’t Work unless an at—
tempt is made to make it work. The new kind
of dance offers interesting possibilities and could
be made a worth while addition to the campus
social life if the Grinnell men and Women will
but give it a bit of support.

Most of the students seem to envision only
endless dances with bespectacled, animated ency-
clopedias or with painfully demure, selﬂeffac-
ing wall»flowers. They seem to forget that they
will not be required to shut their eyes when
seeking a partner, but are privileged to dance on-
ly with whom they wish. .

On the other hand, the complete informality
of the affair will encourage both men and women
to cut in on anyone and any time. “Steadies”
(for even when the heart is pledged, variety re
mains the spice of life) will have a chance to en-
joy an afternoon’s rest from one another’s com-

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

pany; for everything possible will be done to dis-
courage dating for the occasion. Campus clie
ques will be broken up for the afternoon and the
less bold will be offered an opportunity to widen
their list of acquaintances.

If a few simple rules are observed, the dance
can be a success. All obligations to regular boy
and girlfriends must be forgotten for the after»
noon. Cold stares at approaching strangers are
taboo. Dance with as many different persons
as possible in the course of the afternoon.

And remembereit's free!

ONE DOWN, ONE TO Go

The Grinnell chapter of Sigma Delta Chi gave
further evidence of its sincere wish to be of real
value on the campus when it voted earlier this
week to contribute money to make omission of
the Steiner Memorial prize in essay writing this
spring unnecessary. This organization has been
the instigator of many. popular and traditional
projects at Grinnell and has long been an earnest
promoter of journalistic and literary activities on
the campus, It sponsors the Gridiron banquet
(omitted last fall because of a date conflict), the
annual Brown Derby Drag, the Malteaser, and
is this year hacking the Cyclone. It is probably
more active than any other organization on the
campus.

The inﬂuence which Sigma Delta Chi wields
in school affairs has been developed through its
willingness to take initiative in movements for
which all other groups refused to t: c the re
sponsibility. Its promptness in acccp '1 SDOI‘h
sci-ship of this year’s essay prize as its poker.
bility due to the position it holds in the field of
journalistic and literary endeavor. is character-
istic of the organization.

Provision should still be made, however, for
the financing of the Steiner prize in graphic arts,
The Popularity and high quality of entries which
marked the Competition last year makes it equally
desirable that this award should not be abandon-
ed this Spring, Since there is no logical group
on the campus to back a project in this field, the
head of the prize and awards committee has ex-
pressed willingness to devote this year's limited
income from the Steiner Memorial fund to a
prize in graphic arts competition if some campus
organization will take the responsibility for sup-
plying a prize in the play writing contest, which
otherwise Will be financed by the income from
the fund.

Since there are two or three student dramatic
organization which might very appropriately
agree to finance this award, this seems a possible
answer to the problem, Of course none of
these groups is at all obligated to make an agree-
ment of this sort, but it offers them an unusual
opportunity to prove their worth as leaders and
promoters of dramatic activity on the campus.

New Government
Fruit of Political
Insecurity - Frank

(By Associated Collegiate Press)

New York—(AC?) - “Lenin, Stalin,

lery Of political experimentalisls have
flowered from the soil of insecurity."

That was the remark of Dr. Glenn
Frank, President of the University ol
Wisconsin, when he appeared as guest

World Affairs" series of broadcasts
sponsored by the Intercollegiate Coun.
oil over the National Broadcasting
company network recently from station

"Not a single one of these govern.

national situation of peace, plenty and
psychology of security,"Dr. Frank con.
tinued,

“We cannot hope to conquer insec.
urity with hare-.brained schemes to
boost prices by legislating scarcity in
an age of plenty, and then taking care
of the victims of the security we have
legislated through elaborate and costly
insurance schemes to be paid for by
national enterprise that we have de.
liberately and drastically scaled down.

Frank, “if economic leadership leaves

like enough to .‘ealize that the problem
must be met politically.

“The mass demand for economic

If this happens, we shall be in for a
generation of legislation that will
level the men and enterprises of the
United States down to a slimly sure
but uninspiring and, in my judgement,
ultimately unproductive life, even for
the masses.

“I refuse to believe that we are
(loomed to the destiny of fairly well.

an alkembracing state. And yet it
is no just this that political pressui-c
from the masses will drive us unless

Coins That Saw The Glory of Greece

Department

Coins that may have been paid to
Judas, coins that paid the Roman le.
gionairesiscores of coins that must

jects in the days of ancient Greece and
Rome are included in the collection of
the archaeological department which

compares the coins with the descrip.

issued by the United States mint,

Since the first of October he has
been going over the coins daily,
subjecting them to a minute inspec.

glass in order to check their every
detail and to properly record them.
Coins from all of the modern countries

I-Iejaz, Java, Borneo, Sumatra and
China, in addition to Rome and Greece,
are among the romantic names which
the Coin collection brings to mid.
Roman coins bearing the letter c gives
mute evidence of the departed glory
of the Caesars. Perhaps, some of the
very coins in the collection were part
of the ”thirty pieces of silver" for
which Judas sold his soul. At least
this is more than mere speculation
since many of the coins come from
that part of the Near East, having
been donated to the collection by
friends of Mr. Spencer who knew of
his interest.

The markings on the coins are

Trade Tokens, Too

Not only does the work of smith
entail his dealing with coins of the
ancient world, but he also deals to a
limited extent with those of the mod.
ern world. In his field he declares
the most interesting and fascinating
part is the work of classifying the
“trade tokens". Trade tokens were
issued by merchant compa cluri .
periods of currency restriction to meet
the need for small change, sinith ex.
'plained. They were only good at ccr.
‘taln stores and never were issued in
large denominations. '

Such sentiments as "our liberties
we prize and will strive to maintain,"
are often found on one side of the
token, while on the other will be the
less idealistic but more practical “Get
your clothes at Ginbel'gs”; which gives
ample evidence that the thrifty issuer
of the tokens was not letting his patri
otic zeal run away with his good busl—
ness sense.

Tokens Widely Used

It is in Canada that these trade
tokens were the most widely used,
Smith stated, Nearly every province
in the Dominion has issued them. Prior
