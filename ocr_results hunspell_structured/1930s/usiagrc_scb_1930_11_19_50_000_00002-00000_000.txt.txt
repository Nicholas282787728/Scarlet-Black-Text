BURNING THE SHOE

Toniol ow afternoon an old Shoe will be tllrown
in a bonfire on Ward field. To most people that
would not mean a great deal, but coming at this
time it means much to thc Grinucll football men.
It means the last football practice of the 1930
scason, and to tho scniors the last football practice
that they will participate in on this or any other
campus.

The ceremony has been observed for a number
of years at tllc clld of the lilst practice of the year.
This year it comes tomorrow afternoon, because
Friday night Grinncll mccts Iowa State Teachers
College on \Vard field in the last game of 1930.

The present seniors have witnessed the tradi-
tional ceremony with morc or lcs indifferent feel-
ings for several years. But this time it will mean it
great deal to them. It will mean the end of their
collegiate football activity. It will moan they will
never again be able to don a football suit and be—
come all integral part of a Pioneer team.

Some of them lllay turn to coaching after
graduation. but there is a feeling about watching
the game from the sidelines different from act-
ually being a part of it.

CLEANING THE SMOKING ROOMS

The closing of the smoking room ill Cottage
Four last week has caused much comment, and has
necessitated tllc facing of a problem which hr 3 been
evaded for more than a year. The provocation for
locking the room was the failure on the part of the
women to keep it clean. According to thc authori-
ties, a warning was given, and was ignored.

The few women of Cottage Four who use the
room have, ulltil now, rolled up their sleeves and
done the job with little argument. Now they uvel‘
that their responsibility has ceased, that in all.lztws
written or unwritten the duty rests with women of
other cottages who use the room, as much as with
them. And thus the situation stands; the door is
locked, but the key could be Secured for the asking.

It has been suggested that a committee be
named to petition for regular cleaning arranged
by the college. If his plal or a simiaz- one, is ca .
Tied through, the authori as should recognize its
plausibility and act in accordance. It would be
little trouble to clean the two smoking rooms in
a superﬁcial fashion each time the loggia is swcpt,
then at regular intervals, perhaps when the cottage
is cleaned, the cleaning staff could include the
smoking rooms as well as the cottage parlors ill
the rounds.

The objection to such a plan was in the be-
ginning neither to discourage nor encourage inter-
est in the smoking rooms, but to Show that the
administration was not involved in any way with
quadrangle smoking. This attitude has outworn its
usefulness. The women have Shown that they desire
some provision for campus smoking, and are will-
ing to cooperate with the authorities to a reason-
able length to secure it. They havc at last expressed

themselves on the most questionable stipulation of '

the bargain. It is likely that their request will not
be ignored, that partial, if not entire responsibility
for cleaning the room will be taken by the college.

CORNELL PLAYS GRINNELL AGAIN

That only football games with large institue
tions are interesting was disproved Friday night
when Grinncll mct Cornell in the ﬁrst gridiron tilt
between the two colleges since 1925. From the opeue
ing gun until the fourth quarter Corncll gave the
Pioneers plenty of run for their money, while ill
the fourth quarter the Purple was fighting off a

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLAGK

victorious Sc dot and black team.

More significant perhaps was llic spirited rival»
l‘y demonstrated by the student. bodies of the two
school Thcrc was competition in thc yells and
bet cell the uuifo 'mcd bands, .But the two hands
united in a rendition of “National Emblem” to
Show that the rivalry \ «IS of a friclldly sort.

Col‘llelerl'IlilICII games have always been ill-
tcl'esting, and thc competition has always been
keen. Since 1909 Cornell has won eight ganlcs mid
Grinncll scvcn. \Vllilc the Pioneers several times
defeated Drakc and 000 by large scores, the Cornell
game was sure to be an upset, according to alumni
rcports. Special trains were oftcn chartered to
carry studcllts to the sccnc of the game.

FRIENDLY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

The last few weeks have brought to light molly
statements of fact that are discouraging to those
desiring peace. France has the largest r 11' force ill
the World. France and Italy are fortifying their
boundary, the maritime Alps. These two nations
scclu farther from naval disarmament than over
bcfol-c. Mussolini is predicting war, and proclaims

«IIILI)”S preparation. Germany wants arms, indeed

is going to start construction of anotllcr of those
ultra-efficient “battleship cruis ”

The average Griullelliau might ask: ”What
docs it matter to me if another European war he-
gills’!” Armistice day Should have reminded all
Aliicricans that we failed to keep out of the last
European war! Another campaign of propaganda,
another Lusitania incident, or one of a hundred
littlc incidents might throw us into another catasr
trophe, a catastrophe which might. wipe out the
entire white civilization!

Again the Grinnellizln might ask: ”\tht can
I do about it?” No individual Student can do any-
tllillg outstanding, but he can “do his bit” by
throwing his weight into public opinion favoring
disarmament, the league, the world court, and
friendly international relations. The influence of
each Stlldcnt will be minute, but what would we
do for an ocean if it were not for cach drop of
material). M.

CAMPUS PROBLEMS ONLY

The tendency among certain individuals, wllo
would make better prcss agents for movie .5 s
than collcgc students, is to treat campus problems
as if they were universally important and the whole
world should be informed.

There are few people in rt liberal collcgc 1i c
Grinncll who would adhere to a doctrine of obscure
utism; and to students thclusclvcs, wllol'c
knowledge of certain cvils is an approach toward
correcting them, they declare tllosc evils. But to
the world at large, Grillucllians would do well to
make an effort at displaying virtue. since faults
will always get into the headlines anyway. -

Suppression of news is not intended, for it
serves only to exaggerate the importance of certain
events in the eyes of the public, but where only
general consideration of facts is involved, it would
seem well to confine discussion to this campus.

Of course the modern tcndcncy is toward ennui.
oration of faults. Babbitt and Elmcr Gantry are
displayed as types of Alllrrican citizenship, yct
cvc he knows that they are by no means typical.
A small amount of drinking, as compared with
other collcgcs and universities, is seized upon to
make the general impression of Gl'illnell more vivid
throughout the State. Students takc Griullcll’s
scholastic standing for granted and expect every
one else to do likewise. Then they advertise the
things that they sllollld like to improve.

Grinucll has no stciu Song or beer parlors. It
has smoking rooms for women who would other-
wise smoke surreptitiously, hilt that is no slur on
Grinlicll coeds. It simply reflects the feeling on
tho part of the public that college women are ex-
pected to smoke.

The department of pubic rclations, since it has
been organized, has had to work continuously to
counteract the effect of much adverse publicity.
There is but one thing to do about it. That is, rc-
lucmher that these are campus problems, and cam-
pus problems should be conﬁned to the campus.—

HOW FAST IS ‘SAFE‘?’
(From the Clair Luke Reporter)

Death to one University of lowa student and injur»
ies to several others recently in auto accidents, brings
up the question, “how fast is safe and proper driving?”

The tendency among legislators today is to put the
whole responsibility on the driver and not to set speed
limits, Already 12 states have abolished maximum rate
laws and the results have been fewer accidents. 0n the
“autostrada” in Italy, with no grade crossings and from
which pedestrian trafﬁc is barred, accidents are almost
unknown, sltbnugh there is no speed limit.

No deﬁnite speed can be termed safe at all times.
Proper rate depends on road and trafﬁc conditions. an
a given stretch of paving. 45 miles an hour might be
safe, but if that road was wet 20 miles an hour might
be unsafe.

Improvements of roads and motor vehicles has more
than doubled and keeping step with this change, speed
limits average about twice as high as 15 years ago. New
safety devices on cars, such as four wheel brakes and
non-shattering glass, have made them much safer even
in a crash.

Reckless, not fast dri ng, is the cause of most ac-
cidents. With no speed limit to enforce, ofﬁcers can de-
vote their time to keeping reckless drivers off the high-
ways. Only by making the penalties severe for care»
less driving, can the highways be made safe under a
system in which speed limits have been abolished.

Tavo Guards Graduate

Ward Chambers and Orville Orr
are two guards Who will be lost by
graduation. Chambers was not in
school last year, but returned this
year to see considerable service at
his line post. Orr is the last of a
famous family that has hung up mums
erous athletic marks at the Tutnr
school.

Lynn Berryhill is a letterman of
last year who has bad to share a
tackle berth with recruits from last
year's frosh squad. He is big, rangy,
and gets his percentage of tackles.

Captain on Sidelines

injuries make the lineup tentative,
since four regular backs are on the
sidelines with injuries. Three of
them, Captain Tompkins, Hurley, and
Olsen, are backs. The other injured
player is Cooper, who may or may not
start, depending on the condition of
a wrenched ankle. If unable to start,
Dardis will probably take his end
position.

Captain Tompkins is a possibility
as one half, if, too, an injured leg
mends by game time. Buriey. who
has played in every game thus far
this season, will probably be out
with a wrenched knee, suffered in
the Michigan Normal game Saturday.
Olsen, quarter or half, will probably
not see action. This player, one of
the best all-around backs on the
Tutor roster, had two ribs torn loose
in the Michigan Normal Lilt.

Will Loosen Up ncre

The Teachers are drilling on a dc-
fense for spinner and pass plays in
preparation for the Grinnell on~
slaugbt. Scrimmage drills with the
second frosb team will occupy them
also, since the first yearling eleven
meets the scarlet 'and black first year
team here Saturday.

It is planned that the squad will
leave here by bus at 2 o'clock Friday
afternoon, arriving in Grinnell in
time for a short loosening up rlrill.

The Iowa State Teachers college
band of 56 pieces will accompany the
team to Grinnell for the game Friday

Four Varsity Men
Out With Injuries

With four regulars lost to the team
due to injuries, Grinnell will have a
battle on its hands when the Pioneers
take on Iowa State Teachers here
Friday night. This is the last game
on the scarlet and black schedule.

Thomas, Humphrey, Graflund and
Ruff 'are all nursing serious injuries.
Thomas, particularly, will be missed
in the game Friday night. He has
been calling signals all 'season and
has done a good deal of the ball car—
tying.

Valley tackle, maimed with a broken
hand. Graflund broke his shoulder
in the Cornell game last Friday, and
he will not be able to play football
again until next year.

A light practice Monday, followed
by scrimmage yesterday, showed the
Grinnell mentor it will be a compar-
atively weak Pioneer team that will
face State Teachers. Fumbles, and
lots of them, spotted both practices.

Bilto Back at End

Although Coach Watt indicated
that his starting lineup was uncerr
tain, it seems likely that be will use
Hensley, James, or Mccreary at half-
backs, Captain Douglas at full, and
Ullricb in the quarterback berth. In
the line will be Christoffersen at
center. Bradford and Norton,
guards; Walker and Tipton, tackles,
and Minier and Bilto on the ends.
