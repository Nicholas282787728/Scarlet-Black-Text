BE DIFFERENT

College students today are facing :t danger
that cannot be overlooliedithat' of berolniuo .o
much alike that they will be ilidistiugll liable
from each other.

There Seems to be It general feeling muons:
cellegialis, that to break away from “the common
11811" and be different, whether it be ill thinos
he does or ill the number of buttons on his rout
Sleeve, is all out and out heretic and therefore
Solllroiie to be shunned. ‘

Such should not be the ease ost of our really
great leaders have been “diffcrelit”. No one b i0 —
ed the ‘ ‘horseless on logo" would stay, until ltl‘eni-i'
Ford went to worli on them and the whole woi (‘l
laughed at the \Vright brothers when they lluilt
their first “flying machine". Yet, now that Sallie
world honors them as pioneers in their fields.

Bo different. Mid by that we do not mean
being artificially different. Be different, and yet,
7Be yourself!

They fire not only “struck” by the rllpidity

the fact: that. few or no rules are indulged in by

one has as yet been lllirt. but there is always fl po-
tential danger, which can’t be overlooked.

It: iS not the job of Pt newspaper to turn “Emily

EARNEST
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Being earnest is importantiand laudable. And yet,
there is an impediment in being too earnest.

The collegiatc press thruout the country has had
several severe blows dealt its pride. It has been a bad
year for amateur journalism and college students all
over the land have pretty gencraliy taken it to heart.

The Reed Harris affair was good newspaper "copy”
and has been widely publicized. The entire nation has
been well informed of this and other disputes between
student editors and faculty members. Likewise has the
public been told of the endeavors of the students made
in behalf of their editor-contemporaries.

It is pretty generally thought by the outside un-
prejudiced world-at-large that college students have
been a little too earnest in their mass meetings and
strikesia little too earnest and not level-headed enough.

The students from an eastern university who wish»
ed to investigate conditions in the Tennessee coal fields
were also a bit hasty and rash in their earnestness.
They gaincd little respect with their cry that their case
would go to congress. They gravely proclaimed that
they voiced the earnest attitude of practically every
college student at. present enrolled. They were a very
intense body of reformers. Everyone whoever came
within five miles of a campus knows that they claimed
too much.

The strikers, endeavoring to reform the campus

by hasty demonstration poorly thought out, and the
investigators, claiming a reforming urge that is not
typical of the average college student, have thrown a
light on the college that closely npproachcs the ludicrous.
lsoth were too cal-nest.

There is a group of students between the IICVlIrmay-
care type who tire interested only in scores and eccen-
tric clothes and those who are too gravely iii earnest.

This group has found that the best way to do most
reforming is with a grin.

THE NEW COLLEGIAN
(From the Rocky Mountain News)

Apparently the comic magazine conception of the
American college student as a crooning, petting, flask-
toting, rooting, saxophone-touting, jazz—mad sol-t of feta
low is all wrong or clse something new is happening on
the campusses of the land.

Last week SO students from half a dozen colleges
braved the mine-strike terror of Harlan and Bell Coun-
ties, Kentucky, on a tour of investigation, Another
group from Commonwealth College, Arkansas, has
started to the scene of battle, selling copies of the Bill
of Rights to pay expenses. A hand of Vassar, Wellesley
and Smith girls has appealed to congress, after a visit
to Scottshoro, Ala. where seven Negro boys face ehr
ccution after an unfair trial.

A national student league, cumposed of representa-
tive student organizations interested in social justice,
has just met in New York to map a program. Student
publications are militant.

There is an awakening to the social injustices and
conditions among working people on the campuses of
the country," Rob E, Hall, Columbia University student
leader of the Kentucky crusaders, told senators in Wash»
ington. “The reasons are to he found, first, in the fact
that since the war more workingmen‘s sons and daugh-
ters are going to college and, second, in the depression
that brings suffering into sharper relief.”

This student movement is encouraging. The awak-
ening of American students to the wrongs about them
has been slower than in any other country in the
world. While our campuses drawsed or caroused, those
of other lands have seethed in political ferment.

In France it was the students who led the Dreyfus
protest. In Spain they led the republican revolt against
the last of the Bourbons. In China they for-med a nucleus
of the revolution. In Cuba, Venezuela and other Latin-
Amen‘caii countries they have gone to jail by the score
in rebellions against dictatorships. Elsewhere they have
helped to make as well as to study history.

Now there are signs that out of the depression
there may emerge in America a student body dedicated
to social, industrial and political reform.

BE YOURSELF
(From the Midland College Midland)

As the trend toward universal college education he-
comes more popular, many college students attempt to
become something they are not. They sometimes believe
that a college education should make them sophisticated.
They seem to think that their four year college course
sets them apart from the mob, and that they must be
radical in their views because of their superior knowl-
edge. These beliefs cause a growth of or ficinlity which
covers up the real personality,

Some college students speak of their philosophy of
life, even though they have only a vague idea. as to what
it is. in order not to appear ignorant of modern thought,
some students accept every new and radical idea that is
advanced, whether they really believe it or not. others
reject every now teaching indiscriminately in order to
seem individualis . After assuming thcsc numerous
mannerisms for the effect of individuality or radicalism,
the student has no real personality of his own left.

Perhaps the trouble is that some young people do
not realize that thc development of true’ personality is
more important than the attainment of some trait which
sets them off from others. Every person possesses some
characteristics which will make him more individual in
his own personality than will artificial poses.

"Be yourself" is a good slogan for college students to
use in their effort to develop their personality. These
two words mean: Be natural; be ready to accept new
ideas if they seem reasonable; be capable of forming
your own opi ions; be wary of relying entirely on the
opinion of modern radical leaders; be frank; be courage
ous enough to disagree with leaders when you are sure
they are wrong; be ready to stand up for your rights,
and be wise enough to let moderation be your guide.

An attempt to appear different and to parade arti»
ficial ideas as a philosophy of life will seldom aid in his
real development, On the other hand, a sincere attempt
toward being one’s self will bring a real personality
which is not obscured by artificialty.

Editor,

The Scarlet and Black,
Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Sir:

There is considerable talk of drop
ping swimming from the Grinnell ath-
letic program next year. The main
reason given is the difficulty of fi-
nance.

There are many good reasons for
which we believc that swimming
should be retained on the athletic
program. Space here allows the state-
ment of hilt one of these reasons.

There are seven students in school
at present who consider swimming
an essential enough part of their edu»
cation that if the sport were to be
abandoned here, they would transfer
to another school. The aggregate tuii
tion of these men would constitute a
loss of $1,520 per year to the college.

There are at least seven high school
students within our knowledge who
are at present planning to come to
Grinnell next year, but whose inter-
est in swimming is great enough that
they would undoubtedly go to another
school should the sport be abandoned
here. This would constitute another
loss of $1,520 per year, bringing the
total loss to the college to $3,040
per year.

Since the yearly swimming pmr
grain costs the college less than
$3,000, it seems evident that the col-
lege not only can afford to have the
sport, but also that it is good bu.
