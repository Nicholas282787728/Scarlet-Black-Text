CAN AMERICA STAY OUT?
Can the United States stay out of the next European

war?
That is a question that the American people should
be considering. The general attitude on the part ot
American leaders in economics, business, and finallcc
that it will be impossible for America to isolate herself
in the event of war. ‘

It is interesting to examine the views of a forergn
authority on intelnatifmal affairs. Dr. Walter Kotschmg,
an Austrian, who spoke at the recent Grlnnell student
conference on International Relations, said that while
most Americans believe it impossible for America to stay
out of the next war, that it is possible. The United
States has no interest in the quarrel between Fascism
and Communism or in the impelialistic ventures of Eur-
0 ed
1) Dr. Kotschnig, also, pointed out that the United
States should make thel fact clear that in the event of a
European war, She will remain strictly neutral. There
are'many nations in Europe today who are lloplrlg that
America will come to their aid in case of war, and such
hopes should be banished from the minds of European
statesmen at once.

An American policy of neutrality will involve a
great sacrifice by the American people during a war.
Neutrality will hurt our farmer and harm our manufac—
turer and business man. But that sacrifice will be noth»
ing compared to the disastrous result of the United States
entering another foreign conflict.

The United States cannot afford to pay so dearly
again for another European war. J .D.V.

PRICE or SPEED IN )IODERN BUSINESS
(Daily Trojan)

In squslid httle shacks in central West Virginia, 100 or more
emaciated men resignedly are awaiting death. No miracle or
modem science can prevent silicosis from eating out their lungs,
but ll". dying they are awakening the United States to n shocked
realization that big business places none too high a. value on
human lives

Because dry drilling in a tunnel was cheap -, several thousr
and workmen were forced Lo breath dense s ice dust; msny
of them contracted silicosis, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and other
pulmonary disorders that already have dragged some into the
grove.

In the West, construction companies, blatantly proud of their
speed records and efficiency on the Boulder (lam and. Parker dam
projects, know that the public soon Wlll forget the screams of
eight workmen burned to death, and the moans of 35 survivors.
Ohscured by the rapidity With which Boulder dam was construct-
ed are the many score lives which that rapidity cost, and hundreds l
of cripples it left in its wake. ’

Speed is paramount in construction work; cheaper than the
slowing down of the juggel'nallts is the pensioning of widows and
maimed survivors.

Just as in the shadow of the pyramids mean the ghosts of
the thousands of pain-rocked souls whose lives were laid down to
the vaniLy of long»dead pharaohs, behind monumental American
construction projects hide the spethes of needless victims of thc
rapaclty of big business.

and William Sampson will referee
I the first game, while Lynn Schlot-
lterbcck and Robert McLeod will

(Editor's note: ‘ This is the first

views which will be written by Dr.

(By Edward A. stciner)

Chapel attendance at Grin-
nell college is not compulsory,
but it can be mndc contagious.
The average student attend
once last week was 172.

The Chapel committee will op»
preciate suggestions about the
improvement of the chapel ser—
vices. Communications may be
dropped in Professor Ccrlard's or-
Professor Steiner's box in the ad-
ministration building.

Chapel services reached an
almost ideal state this week.
Student sudiences gathered
compactly in front and were

numerically impressive.

The organ preludes created a
spirit of devotion and of hushed
expectancy.

The hymns chosen were sn—
nounced not merely as num-
bers, but with some special
emphasis. Dean Beetty glor-
ified the midwestern spirit
and found it interpreted in
the Grinnell college hymn.
Professor Conard‘s reading and

interpretation of passages from
the first three chapters of Genesis
disclosed their profound poetic
value and their universal mean-

ing.
