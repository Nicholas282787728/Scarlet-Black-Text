THANKSGIVING DAY AT HOME

Thanksgiving Day shollld be observed in the
home ill so far as it is possible. It is intended to
be a day of family reunions. Tllc faculty ’5 actioll
in giving Grillnell students an extra day’s rcccss
at Thanksgiving is ill harllldny witll that of tile
president of the Unith States ill annually declar-
ing this national holiday. It allolvs Grinllellians to
carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the
edict.

The anniversary of the first community gath-
ering of the Pilgrims to give thanks to God for
the successful harvest at the end of their first
year in America was botll a patriotic and a spirit»
uul meeting. If that first harvest was meagre in
comparison with the rich abundance which was
yet. to come, it was no less a time of rejoicing. The
people of this nation may feel that this year they
havc less material goods than ill other years, but
only more should they bc thankful, as their forc-
ftlthel's were, for that which has been given them.

With opportunity extended to many more stu-
dents by the. lengthened recess, Thanksgiving Day
may be kept ill tho homes as was originally intelldr
cd. It will enrich the day for both the students and
their families, and contribute to a renewed bond
of fellowship.

FOR THOSE WHO SLEEP

Grinnell college men continue to pay For un-
caten breakfasts, continue to buy lncals later ill
the morning or go without breakfast, and continue
to complain about the injustice of making them
pay for meals ullicll they do not eat. It is only
fair to bring out that efforts have been made to
remedy this situation but none have been thought
practicable.

Ollc proposition which looked feasible for a
time last year was that of sl‘l'villg crackers and
milk between 8 and 9 a.lll, ill the. old college inn
under Gates hall. Since the full Tome of, waiters
is not necessary in the dining rooms for breakfast,
it sccms that soluc could take care of giving ollt
the crackers and milk to late risers. Equipment
lleetl include only chairs, bowls. spom crackers
ill large boxes and milk ill a container.

This plan, when advanced to Mi Anne E.
Smith, llnu. director, was met cnthu. asticall)‘,
but was relm cd by the ho mothers. The reason
has never been made publi One of the house
mothers this year has already expressed herself
as being ill favor of such a plllll cvcll though it
might result ill some cracker crumbs llll t'llllll‘OOlu
floors.

Thcrc arc many students who do not have
8 :20 or 9 '20 classes on many (la and llK‘l'C‘ scvlus
to be littlc reason to cxpcct them to rise at ’7 a.m.
for bi-crll . Olllcrs have disvov 'cd that they can
do their ll work by sticking at the desk through
most of the night and getting as much slccp :ls
possiblc the following lllm‘lllll‘l‘, Bl'(‘lll(rn§t at 7 am.
clinics no appeal for them. Still others would pre-
fer crackers and nlilk to l)l‘l‘ﬂl{I' foods and toast
{IS are served regularly at dormitory breakfasts.

These students probably deserve some mctllod
of avoiding paynlmlt for lll' llif t, S H‘K' tho plan
suggcstod did not meet lvltll approval last year,
:l new one should be suggcstod. But perhaps this
had best be loft ill the hands of the students who
continue to pay for llllcatcll breakfasts and who
continue to complain about the illjl 'thC of lllllkl n
tlloln pay for meals from which the, do not, bcllofil.

WHY WE HAVE ASSOCIATIONS

What would Griilnoll without a Young Wom-
en’s Chri tian association or Young Men’s Christ-
ian association be like? At ﬁrst thought, it would
seem that cvcrything would be the same. But
gradually, something of the spirit of the meetings
of botll men and women would be missed. li‘cwcl
good spczlkcls would come to tllc canlpll Some
other organization would have to manage the gen-

cral reception, or perhaps thrrr wouldn‘t be any.
The girls would miss the little informal teas in tho
Associatiolls’ building and freshman girls would be
robbed of contacts they now ﬁnd with their big
s tel’s, AL as the ocean, Gl'lllllclldllrcllllm would
suddenly have ll moons of it support withdrawn.

’l‘h di situation i' not apt. to come about.
The as ociatiolls are wcll enough cslabl 'llcd in
Gl-illucll to stay at least it few years. In fact, it
is only when bus stops to consider that the ex-
ccllcllcc of the organizations and their functions is
realized.

All ample of their efﬁciency is the Pioneer
Che. , a treasury from which all cxpcnscs of both
:lsso iations are taken. A student’s contribution
is gll cn ill one lump sum, instead of in little drib-
lets during the yczlr. Distribution of the money
thus accumulated is budgeted so that all needs are
trcatcd proportionately. By this method, cxcclb
tires of the associations can plan their programs
at the beginning of the year, and by budgeting
the money, funds are used to the best possible ad
vantage.

Not the least attractive feature of the Pioneer
(‘llcst is that it is made up of voluntary student
contributions. Since the organizations are for stu-
dcsts, it follows that they lllust support them. but
nothing ill the way of dues has ever been asked.
Payments to the fund dcpcrnd on the student’s cirr
cumstances and good will. This system seems to
carry out the spirit of mutual hclpfulncss.

BEATING 'I'I-m DEADLINE

Grillnell ofﬁcials wasted no time this your in
getting the glass windows of the Ward ﬁeld press
box ill shape to permit proper handling of the ﬁrst
football game. As a result, although the game
didn’t end ulltil 10:30, the complete play by play
account of the contest was in the hands of editors
by 10-35.

Completed leads were over the wires by IOAS,
and, although this did not “make” tllc Grillllcll
edition of the Des Moillcs Register, it did reach
other early editions and the Coe—Grinnell game
consequently received a wider circulation than it
would have othenm'se,

These windows will be appreciatcd even more
during the cold weather which is certain to be in
evidence for one of tho rcmlainillg two games at
Grinncll.

WOMEN’S RIGHTS
(From the Pruduc Exponent)

Among recent student rebellions probably the one
which has attracted the most public interest is that
in progress now at Northwestern university, where
coeds are petitioning for the right of local option in
sorority houses on the smoking question. Student coed
leaders have banded together in their ﬁght, not neces—
sarily to legalize smoking in houses, but to give each
group of girls the right to decide for itself what rules
it shall follow

The question of coed smoking is not entirely a new
one, The practice has been developing for several years.
along with freer modern standards of conduct and the
taking on of greater responsibility by women. It is now
a generally known fact that a majority of coeds on
any college campus smoke, some only occasionally and
others more or less habitually.‘[Northwestern university
is certainly no expection to the rule. Reports have it
that coeds, driven from their houses when they wish to
smoke, take to open streets. The dean of women torn
bade smoking on the streets of Evanston the first part
of last week, but she only divided the crowd. Some of
the girls continue to smoke on the streets, while others
are driven to restaurants and other public buildings to
use the "weed."

It is not our purpose to eiuier commend or con-
demn the practice of Good smoking. It is a fact that
a. great majority of coeds do smoke, and university
ofﬁcials, particularly those Who are connected with the
management of sororities, would be better off if they
dared to fact the cold facts and act accordingly. If
many of them would only admit what they actually
know to be tdue, many a college campus would not
be burdened with a rule which has long since grown
obsolete.

Certainly the coeds at Northwestern, or any other
university for that matter, are old enough that they
do not need the tender care of a guiding hand over them
till the time. it is- time they were allowed to stand on
their own feet and make a few deoismns for themselves
if they are ever going to begin at all, In case the cur-
rent petitions at Northwestern university are not grant-
cd by the faculty, the coeds have reached 9. more or
less mutual agreement to follow a plan similar to
Gandhi’s program of passive resistance. Wherein lies
are power of an authoritative minority when the ma-
jority has determined to act?

A COLLEGE GRADUATES INTELLIGENCE
(From the California Daily Bruin)

According to a, recently issued report of the Car-
negie Foundation, the average college senior is no more
intelligent than the average freshman. The Foundation
makes its report after giving a number of examina-
tions to students in many colleges and universities. The
reason for the rather startling result of the investiga-
tion is attributed to the fact that the four years of
college are divided into a specific number of courses
and examinations and the student promptly forgets
what he has learned when he completes a course.

Whether or not the world should accept the findings
of the Foundation as the truth depends to a large extent
on the meaning of the word “intelligence,” If, by in
telligence, the report means knowing facts concerning
economics, geology, and chemistry it is probably true
the senior doesn't add much to his intelligence by his
:eur years of association with professors and books.
But if intelligence means the ability to appreciate and
understand the world around us, to know where to
look when information is desired, it is safc to assume
that the average senior is far superior to the student
who is just matriculating‘,

It is nothing new to criticise the educational sys-
tern in vogue in American universities. Thousands of
students attend classes, read text books, take examina»
tions and, remember few of the facts that they are re-
quired to put down in their blue books during finals.
But it is a question whether it is more important to
remember an unlimited number of unrelated facts than
to acquire the general culture and understanding that
most college graduates possess. The Carnegie Founda-
tiou’s report may be perfectly correct, but it shouldn't
deter anyone from continuing his college education.

f Campus Opinion 1

Do you believe the Cluengo Tribune
should be in the library?

Richard Ullricll: It is the repre-
senative paper of the middle west,
probably second only to the New
York Times in the country. surely
it should be in our library.

Helen nut: Yes, i think the Trib-
une should be in the library. It is
one of the largest and most repre-
sentative papers in this part of the
United States.

Marguerite Kmecny: The Tribune
carries little foreign news and that
which it does carry is modified to
suit the policies of the paper. It
should be possible to substitute a
paper combining the midwestern
news with a larger proportion of
foreign news,

Frank Spengler: Since the Des
Moines Register is not representative
and the New York Times is too large,
we must have the Chicago Tribune.

George Van Nostmlnd: The Chica—
go Tribune may color its news, but
if the student doesn't gain enough
ability to discriminate while in col—
lege. to separate the true from the
false, what will happen to him when
he gets out of college? Another rem
sou why we need the Thibune is that
without it or its equivalent, we have
no daily financial news for current
reference.

Max Ross: Despite the fact that
the Tribune has its weaknesses, it
nevertheless gives an insight into
midwestern affairs not obtainable in
the more established papers such as
the New York Times. It the library
doesn't bring back the Tribune, it
might substitutes more localized pa—
per in its place. for instance, the
Kansas City star.
