A STEP FORWARD

The w011d is now in the midst of a c
Evelybody knows that. But not cvervbody rear

1'ch just how seiiolls are these conditions or how
for reaching lnay be tllc results. Sisley IIucldlcs-
ton, newspaper correspondent and author, says
that an entire social change 15 involved, and that
future histoﬁans will look on the present peliod
much as we look back on the Renaissance or Re-
formation.

With such conditions existing, it is the cons
tincnt which deserves the greatest stlplltiml. ,Tho
reason for this is obvious, for where there are so
many different nationalities groupcd' so closely
together, each with its own views and administra-
tions, it is there that Serious trouble would he most
likely to arise. The problem is not only one of
various governments and policies, but one of Clifr
fering cultures, telllperaments, religions, and cus-
toms, which i. far more difﬁcult of solution.

Tllc rccellt. agreement between France and
Germany is, therefore, of great signiﬁcance. France
is probably the most stable country in Europe at
the present time, yet the lliost stubborn and un-
willing to yield. Germany, on the other hand, has
many grievances and wlollgs to he 1cdrcsscd. She
has many masons to bc unsatisﬁed, but was so
crippled by the u 11- that she can do nothing

At this meeting Laval and Bliand lcprcscnted
France, and Ililldcllbul'g, Germany. The result
was a plan for an appointed commission to illvcstie

gate conditions in the two countlies and attempt
to bring about hctter relations between them.

The important result of this agreement is not
found llollc ill the wmh which the commission may
do, for not a great deal ls vct c\pccted But that
the fetus and pl'cjudic s of these two countlics
have been laid aside to this cxtcllt should be a
good indication. The strong and the weak, the
conqueror and thc conquered, arc sucking coopera-

AFTER COMMENCEIVENT. WHAT?

Commencement Julie 6, 1932, is today a disc
tant goal for those who will he graduated from
Griullell college then, But it might not be amiss
for the seniors to be thinking about the signiﬁcance
of that goal. “fill it he the beginning of a fuller
life or the ending of the fullest life they shall
over kuow’!

There are always those who, whcll four years
of college or ullivcl ity education arc completed,
retire from tho pursuit of knowledge and, like the
sleeping bounty, entor a coma that shall not end
until solllc further Stimuli arouses tllcnl, Tile houn-
dal-ics of whatever ﬁeld they enter lend to become
the limits of their range of thought and perspco
live. Intellectual progress is at a standstill, and
the fullest life cannot exist.

By the time the senior year is reached, the
student has a clear View of the course behind and
before him. The subjects required to satisfy his
major and minor arc usually completed, or nearly
so. He then has an opportunity to elect Subjects
in other branches. By contact with these his ﬁeld
of vision widens and rounds out his llol‘.oll of
knowledge. Vthl-cas his Way has perhaps seenlcd
uncertain and not quite satisfying, he now rcaliv s
that he is beginning to awaken to the full signiﬁ-
cance of the relation of heretofore apparently un-
related parts, to each other and to the world of
thought as a whole.

When this mental awakening takes place, the
college student has found the vital cause for living.
Collllllcucelneut for him shall be, not the end of
a time of exquisite happiness, rapid intellectual
growth and development, but the real beginning
of a new life of mental and spiritual growth that
shall make him a needed individual in the world
outside.

VICTORY LOST?

Last year Gl'iuncll Studcuts succeeded ill gain-
ing an additional day‘s vacation on Friday follow-
ing Thanksgiving. It took concentrated efforts of
the entire student body under the leadership of
the student council to gain this end, When the
victory was gained, it ufls naturally thought that
the school adxllillistrfltivc authorities would make
allovzlllccs for such vacation in future years, just
as they had in the past, but according to most re»
cent college bulletins, students ilrc accorded no
clay of vacation following Thanksgiving.

This means that the goal has been lost—and
that the struggle must be waged anew. It doesn’t
seem fair that students should he forced to attend
classes on the Friday following Thanksgiving for
the ma, ity of students desire to go homc. Ber
cause the school ofﬁcials allow but one day 5 Va-
nation at that time, it is ‘l-tlmlly impossible. for
students to he with their parents.

Thclc might be a justiﬁcation for the denial
of this day s vacation if the fall term did not open
until late ill September, but classes started earlier
hcre ill the fall than in any other'Iowa collcgc.
It seems that the term is long enough to justify
an additional day of vacation at Thanksgiving
time. Administrative authorities granted this bcv
fore and last year were moved by student action.

“Why shouldn’t students be rewarded with that

which they won a year ago, vacation on the Friday
following Thanksgiving?

The Scarlet and Black
Grinncll, Iowa

Dear Sir:

In our chapel, we students of
Grinncll have as fine and as stimu-
lating an institution as one finds
anywhere. Yet the attendance has
been poorer every day of the semes-
ter than it was the day before. Some-
thing must be wrong. Is it that the
students do not Want chapel badly
enough to get up so early? Is it
that the studcnts are not interested?
or could it be that the hour is at
fault? It seems to be common opin-
ion that the latter reason is the true
one.

Whenever something is found to be
wrong in the scheme of things, we
should do our best to right the
wrong. The solution to this prob-
lem lies in changing the present
chapel hour. Both faculty and stu~
dents have discussed the relative
values of a 10 o'clock chapel and a.
12 o’clock chapel, and the great ma-
jority feel that the 10 o’clock hour
is best.

Two years ago when chapel was
held at 10 o‘clock, at least twice as
many students attended as at pres-
ent. This in itself should be an ade~
quate proof that the 10 o’clock hour
is preferred by the students. If this
hour were adopted, it would provide
a welcome intermission for many of
us who have four morning classes
two or three days of the week.
Furthermore, there are more stu»
dents on the campus at the middle
of the morning than more are at the
beginning or the end, and their ten-
dency is to go to chapel rather than
to their rooms.

When the 10 o’clock chapel was
abandoned, one reason was given
that it had been giving too good an
opportunity to students for going in-
to Alumni Recitation hall to hold
hands with some fair damsel. How
the faculty lmew of this disgraceful
custom, we have never heard; at any
rate, it was real news to most of the
students. Ten o'clock is too early
for holding hands. anyway.

Now that 8 o'clock chapel has been
tried and failed. it seems only fair.
to the students that the 10 o’clock
hour he resumed.

Yours truly,
John Thomas.
