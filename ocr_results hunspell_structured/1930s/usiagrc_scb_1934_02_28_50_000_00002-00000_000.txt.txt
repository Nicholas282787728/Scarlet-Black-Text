PRACTICABI'LITY
On what basis may it vocation be judged prac-
tical or impractical? Is it that it must be either
profitable or non-profitable for the individual? Or
would the practical standard extend to vocations
wllicll benefit mankind or bring happiness to the
individual?

On the first basis, it would seem that some of
the lending scientists, artists and scholars of his-
tory had chosen impractical vacations, for many of
them lived ill hardship and died ill poverty. Henry
Ford would be judged a success solely because he
amassed a huge fortune, not because he chocpclled
and facilitated transportation. Edison’s success
would lie in his comfortable estate, rather than in
his service to humanity.

A practical vocation, to many a lnodcrll busi
ness man, entails efficiency, bookkeeping, advertis-
ing, muss production, profit . the philosopher,
the theorist, the research scho at does not belong.
Yet here we see an enormous factory, Inside is the
most intricate machinery, coordinated and cffi~
cicllt. There is it great production force in spotless
uniforms. Within the great offices are day and
night forces, holding the wires of operation. A net
work of branch offices and hundreds of salesmen
and agents handle the distrihut ll. It is all effi-
cient, practical organization. “What does- this great
system produce?” we ask in awe. “Surely, with
such an enormous cost for production and distribu-
tion, and with such ill) expenditure of energy and
intelligence on creating this huge, workable unit,
the product must be something of great value and
benefit to mankind. What is it?” The manager
answers us. “Chewing gum,” he says.

So technicians, accountants, salesmen, adver-
tising men. office managers, and dozens of others
have undergone years of training for this. To pro—
duce chewing gum. th their work is practical and
efficient, says the world.

Here is n cluttered laborlitory . . . no visible
efficiency and no evidence of bookkeeping. A scion-
tist is hunched over a microscope. He has spoilt
his life in a Search for it remedy for a malignant
disease. He will probably die with the question un-
solved. Herc a philosopher writes and studios,
searching for the eternal “why?” of life. A scholar
delves into original manuscripts to satisfy the curl
osity of himself and others.

WHITE CIVILIZATION

”Another world conflict will ..mc:tli the dc—.

struction of white civilization,” Rev. Erncst F.
Tittle prophesied ill one of his rcccnt Gates lcc-
turos. A few wccks earlier, Sislcy Huddleston, the
British diplomat and journalist, had predicted a
new outbrcak of wzir ill Europe before 1950,
which might develop into a world conflict. The
combined predictions of the two gcntlcmcn point-
ed a picture for the future which was discourag-
ing to say the least. Just as the fate of the western
World appeared to be definitely sealed, The
Reader’s Digest republished in the current issue
an article, written st year ago by Thomas R. Phil-
lips, which justifics at least a modicum of hopc
for the future.

Mr_ Phillips maintains that the indiscrimi-
nate slaughter of civil populations during thc
llcxt war is cxcccdingly improbable. “Wholesale
(lest ction of civilians has been a matter of hu-
man y or inhumanity,” he claims, and citcs the
fact that less than out- out of every 1,000 persons
killed during the world war were other than 501-
dicrs, wllcrcas millions of civilians had lost their
life in some wars previous to that time.

All of the horrible pictures of u shattered, de~
populated post-war world are painted against 1;
background of wliolcsalc murder by gas and
bombs. They involve a world which is defenseless
against destruction frolu high explosives hurled
down from the sky and a people hclplcss to save
themselves from the ravages of poison gases But
the creators of those gloomy pictures have fol-
lowed only the development of offensive instru-
ments of war, completely ignoring the commensur-
ate advancement of defensive measures.

These tales of foreboding, as Mr. Phillips
points out, foil to take into consideration that
gassing zi city the size of New York would require
28 million pounds of phosgene, 14,000 airplanes,
and 280 airplane carriers to transport the planes
to the coast of the United States; that anti-aircraft
guns have been built which furnish much more cf-
fcctivo protection against invading forces than a
defensive 2dr force possibly could; that at best
bombing is 9. highly inaccurate moons of attack

YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW
"To look at the past with contempt is to look
ill tho future with tlcsplill.” Thcsc recent words of
Dr, Tittle nrc full of ti wisdom too frequently for-
gotten. Wholi members of the older generation 19"
'o arr going to the do ‘5, we are inclined to smile
licnlly mid rcply, “\Vlicre have you pointed our
toul'sc. \Viihill the space of :l generation you lllli'c
brought us the wo st war and the worst depression
in human histo , ; you have I‘ulllf‘d lnilliolls
lhi-oiigli povori r u lilo your flivorcd few have lot
(cued on ext ; you have given us ml economic
s\ (cm which lczlvcs incn hungry lll\(l linked in a
land overflowing with food and clothing. Now
you tell us we are going to the (logs bccausc we do
not follow the path you have worn for us! We do
not wish to follow it!”

Oi“ course we speak tllc truth when no answer
thus. but we do not speak the whole truth. History
is, to be sure, full of terrible blunders and dcv‘ tnte
illg ' lures. It is full of wars and depression.
injustices and illdccelicies, but it is full of other
things, too. It has given us not only ugliness. but
beauty. not ollly selfishness, hut sacrificial itlcolr
ism. It produced not only Machiavelli, but Jesus,
too, Indced, is there ollc of us who could udluc as
many villains as saints? It is only because yester-
day lilis been able to produce men like St. Francis
and Beethoven and Galileo that we can work
bravely and hopefully, having faith that tomorrow
can also produce them. We cannot confidently seek
future progress unless we remember the progress
of the past.

With all their ,usticcs our modern courts are
infinitely better lllltu trial by torture. With all its
dictatorship Europe is better today than it was
three hundred years ago, for autoorlicy has bcrcolnc
ll tcmporary necessity where it was then a pcrlnn-
llellt institution. \Vitll till the distrcss of our mod-
crn slavery, we have lit least learned that slavery
is wrong, and with that lesson wcll learned, we can
hopefully move forward. The League of Nations
has not yet succeeded ill ending war, but it has
pointed the way. All effective system of distribut-
ing wealth has not yet been born, at least outsidc
of Russia, but we have zit least mustered half the
problem of filling human need: we have learned
how to produce all that man requires.

Without perspective we have eyes but we do
not see. The present world is not just chaos, and
the long sweep of history has been forward, not
backward. In that fact lios hopc. “To look at the‘
post with contempt is to look at the future with
despair."

SOCIALIZED MEDICAL CARE
(North Carolina Daily Tar Heel)

What of the future of medicine? This question is
not only being asked by many students or our social or-
der, but by medical men themselves. Among the younger
members or the profession and among most medical
students, however, there is a general feeling of apathy
toward this query. And yet it is one of our most impor~
tant problems of the future.

Along with the present collectivistic trend of our na-
tional economy there is likely to follow similar, commen-
surate changes in other phases of the country's life.
And the status of the medical profession will almost cer-
tainly change also. The movement in medicine has al-
ways been toward the preventing rather than the cm -
tivc approach. It is both logical and fortunate for man-
kind that this has been true.

With the government ever assuming greater re-
sponsib ty for the health and happiness of the indivi -
ual citizen, there has naturally been an increased use of
the physician by the state. This has a double signifi<
canoe. First, it involves the concept that sickness is not
only an individual matter but constitutes a social liabil—
ity as well. Secondly, it means that the medical man is
going to become increasingly conscious or his own im-
portance as a unit in the structure of society.

And instead of remaining passive in the race of this
change, the physician can consolidate his own position
and lay the groundwork of future medical practice by
maintaining an active interest in this movement. It is to
be hoped that the eventual socialization of medicine will
come about not through outside influences but by the
leadership of the physician himself.

HOUSING PLANS
(Indiana Daily student)

Both Yale and Harvard universities now are operat-
ing new residential plans for their undergraduates. At
Harvard the units of the plan are called "houses" while
at Yale they are termed “colleges." but at both institu-
tions the purpose of the plan is to promote closer con~
tacts among the students themselves and between the
students and faculty. Another expected benefit of the
new housing systems is aid in securing employment after
graduation.

The officials of both schools point out that “the de-
pression cloud” has had one silver lining in “the recap
ture of some old academic values.” During the days of
prosperity a few years ago jobs were chasing students
around the campuses of Eastern universities, The great-
er part of these jobs was in the commercial world. The
result, according to Albert Beecher Crawford, director
or personnel study at Yale, was, “What the individual
really wanted to do—‘wllat he might make of bimeclt by
creative effort along the lines of his greatest usefulness
—wos lost sight of in the process of filling preconceived
positions. Individual initiative in respect to the choice of
a career became dulled,"

The housing plans are expected to alter this situa-
tion by encouraging closer contact with faculty members
who will help the students with “occupational orienta<
tlon and guidance." Already there has been a marked
loss of interest among students of Yale and Harvard in
the conventional business cureer. students are attract-
ed to exploring the possibilities of other interesting and
worth while careers.

Monday

People on the most distant nebulae.
it equipped with siipeiutclcscopesd,
should now see the world in its pro—
historic strite, declared Henry s. Cour
arrl, professor or botany.

Although light travels 186,000
miles a second, it would take millions
of years for the light rays to travel
that far. A person on Arcturus, look
ing toward Chicago last summer,
would havc seen not the Century of
Progress, but the World’s lrcir of
1893.

Recent discoveiies show that the
most distant stars are rushing away
from the world with a speed which
denotes a universal explosion at some
distant period. “If there has been
some enormous cosmic explosion, it
is past, at least as far as we are con
corned,” professor conard stated.

“AS tar as we know, the stars
which we see moving away from us
may now be rushing- toward us.” It
is on these tacts that be based his
conclusion that it is impossible to
draw a line between the past and the
present. “Everything which has been,
still is," he said.

rniesday

W. c. Oelke, instructor in chemis-
try, stressed the importance of “that
extra something" in his chapel talk
Tuesday. As an example, be cited
Mark Twain's famous jumping frog.

People also have “that extra. some-
thing," according to Mr. Oelke. He
illustrated with the girl who always
has a date and the girl who studies
in the library on Friday night. “There
is always a position open for a man
who will do just a little more than
he promised,” he declared.

Showing Christ’s belief in the he

ccssity of the extra quality, lie quot-

ed the story of his advice to the rich

man to sell all he had and give to

the poor. He closed with Robert Louis

Stevenson's “Morning Prayer."

sistant professor of piano, played
