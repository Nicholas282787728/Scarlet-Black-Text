SATURDAY APRIL 16 1982

By MAX ROSS
A formidable list of entries have
been received for the Drake relays
April 29 and 30 with many of the
nau‘on's leading runners on file. The
University of Indiana has the best—
balanced squad so far, lacking only
in hurdlers.
o s a
Little Mike Pllbrow is going- to
find plenty or competition at the
Dnlke carnival in the nvo-znilelevent.
Henry Brocksmlth, who has nor the
distance in about 9:15, is the favor—
ite to win the race, since Clark
Chamberlain at Michigan State,
whom Pilbrow recently defeated, is

not entered.

s i

’ cliff Watson, a teammate of Brock»
Smith’s on the Indiana squad, seems
to improve with every race, and will
be a serious contender. Wright of
Wisconsin is also a top-notch dis-
tance man, being one of the two men
to better Pilbrow's time of 9:24 last
year.

According to the University of
Iowa tennis schedule, the nawkeyes
will meet Grinnell at Iowa City April
23, and come to Gn'llllell May 3 to
play the Pioneers.

a a

The special cottage relay yester-
day brought to light several good
halfrmilers. Captain Murphy ran bet-
ter than 1:59, while Joe Pfeiffer was
right on Murphy's heels all the way.
Pilbrow’s time was under two min-
utes, giving Coach Les Duke a start
on a two-mile relay team.

9 r s

Murphy's sprint medley teain ese
tnblislicd a mark of s:41.4 in that
race, which Is‘mlly a few seconds
slower than the time or the winner
at the Drake relays last year.

Won first pl‘lze m the National Inc
Lal‘colleglate Glee Club contest, he I
in 51.. Louis, Friday, Ap‘l‘ll 8. The VI
tory was largely due to the club'sl
rendition of “Echo song' by Ol'lan'
(Io dl 71.8550.

This selection would have beeu‘
used by the Gl'inncll Club had it
entered the contest.

Davnl Peck, chairman oi the dos
pnrtnrcnt of more, who sang in the
same quartet with Mr. Lyman. during
his four years in college, has received
a letter from him, a portion of which
follows; "We had a terrible time
raising the money to come, and only
mode it by taking the chair car rate,
and coming all the way chair car.
That’s a long hard trip—three nights
and two clays in a chair car. But it
was worth it, especially since we
were lucky enough to win, Yale was
second and Penn state third.”

The former Grinnell student also
sent regards to his friends. including
President John s. Nollell, H. w. Mat»
lack, Mr. and Mrs. J. w, Gannaway,
and Dr. and Mrs. P. E. somers.
