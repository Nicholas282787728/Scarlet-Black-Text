A WORD OF EXPLANATION

On the Grinnell campus are a great many
customs which might well be called traditions
which are clear to the heart of every student.

The friendly democratic spirit . . the tra-
di onal Drake-Grinnell rivalry . . “buttonihg”

and “Hell Week" . .

“Victory Day" . . the

“Brown Derby" . . freshman caps . . hikes up
the track . . things such as these help to make

Grinnell.

Therefore, we are proud to say:
“Tradition has made the

hite O Spot

the eating place for sludents.”

 

if you're coming back to school, you know you
can figure on getting everything you need
in furniture at the best price at SMITH’S.

And, if you’re new to

Grinnell this fall, you

won’t want to get your room furnishings
until you’ve seen your room and perhaps
your room-mate. Then visit SMITH'S.
That’s why we say “Any way you figure it, you
can't go wrong by waiting and visiting
