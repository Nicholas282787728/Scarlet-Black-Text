Japanese Protest Early Production
of ‘Mikado’ as Satire on Bureaucracy

Holst Says Gilbert Clarifies
Eternal Feminine

in ‘Yum Yum’

Harald Holst, director of-the Mi-
kado has given some inf mation on
the history and characters of the 0177
era which will be of inter-est to those
who expect to attend the production
to be given in Herrick chapel next
week.

During early performances of the
Mikado in London, the Japanese gov-
ernment made several protests, main-
taining that it slandered the good
name of Japan, and asked that the
opera be taken from the boards. The
protests were made through the
Japanese ambassador to England on

the grounds that the Mikado was a
satire against burcacracy and offics|
ial pomposity but the productions
had become so popular that they
were continued.

In reference to the characters, Mr.
Holst calls attention to the fact that
Gilbert has glorified the eternal fem-
inine through the character of “Yum—
Yum" and in the opera has given ade- ,
quatc musical setting to her vanity
in the song “The Sun and I".

The opposite feminine character of
Yum~Yum is Katisha, the tci-msgant
whose beauty long ago has faded but
who still seeks to attract through a
left elbow “which people come miles
to see" and “a tooth that many have
tried in vain to extract." Mr. Holst's
remarks constitute several of the in-
teresting points of the opera which
the Grinnell glee clubs will reproduce
on January 11 and 12,

This rating scale consisted of 23
