As a result of their decisive vic-
tory over the Smith hall swimmers
Thursday night, the Dibble hall
water polo men won the intramural
event, and gave the hall a decided
boost in the race for the Poltle tro-
phy. Earlier in the season the Dibble
basketball teams took the cage
tourney, ‘while the Smith speedball
team took first place in that event.
With the end of the basketball sea-
son the Dibble team was given a de-
cided advantage with the addition of
Dick Ullrich to the group. Ullrich
proved to he one of the best players
in the pool, and Dibble had very lit~
tle trouble in disposing of competi-
tion, with the exception of the first
game against Langau, in which the
former eked out a one point victory.
Next week the Scarlet and Black wiu
announce an all dorm water-polo
team, to be selected by the captains
of the various teams.

Although the spring football ses-
sion has been held for several
weeks, not until last night was any
enthusiasm shown in regard to the
_sport. Coach Watt announced yea-
oerday that the game between the
two We, being captained by

Abe Rosenbloom and captain

Gould. would be held next satur-

dny afternoon at Ward field. This

means unarsome of the players
.who have been skipping the pruc~
tiee sessions will be at quite a

handicap when they line up.

Considerable enthusiasm has been
created in regard to the outcome.
Some believe that one group will win,
while others are equally sure that the
other wlll be victorious. As we see it
the teams are equal in regard to
weight, lettermen, and ability, so
that the mere breaks of the game
will be the deciding factor. Last
night in the practice the men used
their shoulder
time, and Coach Watt sent his men
down under punts for tackling prac-
tice.

Incidentally, the name of Jim
Bradley was unintentionally omitted
from the list of spring football candi-
dates which the athletic department
made out last week. Bradley is on
the squad captained by Rosenbloom
and will probably be one of the major

offensive men for this outfit.
