WOMEN AT MASS MEETINGS ‘

(Editor’s not - This is the first of a series of ar-
ticles on student government. Others will appear
from time to time).

r a x

The coming elections for student leaders
for next year bling sharply to the fore the
whole problem of student government on
tllis campus. The mass meeting on the
women’s side of the campus needs particu-
lar consideration.

These meetings are called sometimes
twice a year, sometimes less frequently.
Experience proved that attendance at such
gatherings would have to be made compul-
sory if any sort of representation was to
be obtained, so a rule to that effect was
established Therefore, attendance is now
at its best as far as numbers are concerned,
but the point for criticism is the spirit
which prevails.

The whole attitude of the women of the
quadrangle, is one of impatience when the
repolt of the social budget committee is
read. The opinion, apparently is that the
committee has been chosen for the purpose
of spending quadrangle money for enter-
tainment of the women—“it’s their duty,
don’t bother us.”

This fall, the women nonchalantly approv-
ed the spending of some $3 500 with only a
casual glance at the speci 'c items of ex-
penditure. Only one objection was raised
to the whole program by the quadrangle as
a whole, and that to the billiard table.

And now, as in past years, when dates
for particular events of the program ap—
proach, very critical discussion of the event
arises.

For instance, a day or so before Dr.
Samuel Kraines, the psychiatrist, arrived
on the campus, objections to his visit were
raised because he was not giving personal
conferences. When he arrived and had
spoken for the day, there was criticism
from those who had expected something
sensationally different. They had not take
en into consideration the fact that a psych—
iatl’ist would have to be present on the
campus at least several days and longer in
order to become acquainted with the general
tone of the college before giving personal
interviews; nor had they considered that
the work of a psychiatrist is to restore a
person to normalcy through the use of com-
mon sense.

But aside from this point is the larger
question that criticism was late coming just
before the speaker arrived. The time for
discussion was at the time of voting the
budget. Individual copies of the budget
were distributed at least a week before
voting to give ample time for conside ation,

The women dodged that responsibility—
shoved it entirely to a committee of six
members. If they do not like the items for
which their $3,500 is beingr spent, it is their
fault and theirs only. The women have
the privilege of objecting to any of~ the
proposals submitted in mass meetings.
Valid criticisms are considered seriously by

THE GRDIN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the committee.

But it is up to you women. At future
mass meetings, make “more active student
participation" your motto.

HARSH CRITICISM

In view of the recent suffering and de-
vastation caused by the flooded Ohio River
the editorial from the Chicago Tribune of
Mar. 7, 1936 reprinted ulldcr “Other Opin—
ions," would seem to bear comment.

It is doubtful whether many of us would
agree with the cold-blooded statement that
the sufferers deliberately chose to be flood-
ed out at intervals in order to have more
fertile land. It would seem more plausible
to believe that they have, ollly in compara»
tively recent times, been forced into these
risky positions by conditions, such as the
exploitation of forests which formerly held
back the water, that are beyond our control.

Censure by the Press will not solve the
problems of these unfortullates. It is our
duty to support those organizations which
will relieve the suffering victims, and plans
which will prevent further ﬂoods,

Other Opinions

FLOODS

(From Chicago Tribune of Mar. 7, 1936)

The expected flccds have followed the first thaws
and, as usual. the sob sisters have been crying
that something must be done to relieve the innu-
cent victims of nature's savagery. There will be
more floods this spring, accompanied by more such
appeals for charity. '

The sob sisters neglect to say that the so»called
innocent victims. are for the most part, prosperous
farmers owning the fattest land in the United
States. They deliberately chose the bottom lands
because of their high fertility and correspondingly
high yields. These farmers knew all about the
flood danger when they acquired their holdings
and actually counted upon an occasional inundation
to maintain the fertility of me land. To regard
such men as innocent victims of an unpredictable
misfortune is to talk nonsense.

The bottom-land farmers should make their own
preparations to meet the danger. Most of them do
so by moving their families and as much of their
property as can be moved to places of safety be»
fore the floods begin. A few are shiftless and
wait to be rescued out of the treetops. Very little
sympathy and money need be wasted upon them.
They took a risk in the expectation of profit and
did it with their eyes open. AS they intend to
keep the extra profits which Come from bottom-
iand farms they expect to pay the price.

GRADES ARE IMPORTANT
(Purdue Exponent)

On a recent hitch-hiking trip a student encountr
ered the same question three consecutive times
from three men who gave him ridcs. That ques-
tion was this: “What were your grades?”

The hitchhiker had always thought of grades
as the expression of the professor’s mood at the
time of marking, but the fact that an army officer,
a well»tordo traveling salesman, and a banker
had all had the same interest in his grades as an
expression of his accomplishment at school, drove
home the importance of the point that friends
and folks had sought to impress on his mind.
There is a large group of college people who scorn
high grades and lock With disgust on those men
elected to honorary groups; and then there are
those who consider membership in those organi-
zations a great honor but do not keep achieve-
ment in their minds consistently enough to make
a really fine record.

At the beginning of every semester there are
many students who resolve to turn over the pro-
verbial new leaf, but never get beyond the first
page. That is due to a lack of consistent determ-
inatiun to keep a high grade of work in their
classes all through the semester. How many men
have you heard recalling their school days with
the Wish that they might have them to live over
again? Nine times out of ten they looked back
with regret for their failure to accept the oppor-
tunity to excel which school had offered them.

While high scholastic records aren’t the only
things to be realized from a college education. at
least they are a testimonial to the amount of
effort put forth by the student on his work. Don’t
be sorry for your own failure to come through.
Don‘t look back at the time of graduation with
regrets. Be able to be proud of your work. It is
the present that counts, so do it now.

F ormer Tomboy 'Co-ed Now Directs
College Beauty Aid Department

Pauline Crook Instructs
Students of Women’s
School in Beauty

By ELIZABETH Lil/MAN

From tomboy m Grinnell to
beauty expert at Stephens college
for women—that is the story of
Miss Pauline Creek '27, a former
Grillnell townrgirl.

Two years ago Miss Crook went
to Stephens to become director cf
the beauty consultation sci-vicc. If
a Stephens girl is having trouble
with a shiny nose or fingernails
which break, if her hair is in bad
condition, or her make-up all
wrong, She may make an appoint-
mcnt with Miss Crook.

Modcriilstic Studio

in her modernistic beauty studio
lined with mirrors and tall glass
cabinets of cosmetics, Miss Crock
tests the girl's skin, shows her how
to condition it, and how properly
to apply her mak up. She may
suggest a new haicdress, or a difr
ferent curve of her eye-brow.
Often she will sketch a style of
hair-dress, and then accompany
the girl to a beauty studio in town
to see that her directions are cars
i‘ied out.

Working with Miss crook is
Miss Myra Jervcy, costunie design-
er and skctcher who has worked
with Jean Paton in Paris. Under
her direction girls may select the
materials and have costumes
draped and made up by her skilled
dressmskers. “Some beautiful
clothes were designed." remarked
Julia Super, a Stephens graduate,
”but they cost plenty of money."

Sev'eml Graduates Here

Crinnell women who graduated
from Stephens last year are Mar-
garet Gordon, Joyce Stribling,
Elizabeth Clapp, and Julia Super,
and they are all enthusiastic about
the personal grooming department.

An article in the September,
1936 “McCall“ gave the depart-
ment nation-wide publicity. Since
then 23 major colleges and univerr
sltics have written to Stephens,
inquiring about the plan. New
York university is now offering a
similar beauty course.

Transforming Wall-Eowers

Miss Clock is so much in doc
mand for transforming Wall-flow-
ers into bcucs, that she now has
an assistant from New York.
Those who knew Miss Crook in
Grinncll say she is probably chuck-
ling up her sleeve at her unexpectr
ed prominence.

At (:n'nnell Miss Crook majored
in zoology, was a member of Wom-
en's Honor C. and was art editor
of the Maltcaser and the Cyclone.
She was a dark, lean, athletic»
looking girl, aggressive and full of
energy.

After graduation she went to
work in the craft department of
Kilpatrick’s store in Omaha, Nebr.
She hoped to do illustrating in the
advertising department, but the
depression left her without a job.
However, the Kilpatrick manager

I Banker Will Interview [I
l Seniors Wednesday

M. s. McCuffln of the Continent-
al Illinois National Bank and Trust
company of Chicago, will be on
the campus Feb. 17 to interview
seniors interested in employmcnt
in banking.

Seniors who wish an appoint-
mcnt shculd call Mrs, Eva Bruders
Hansen of the appointment bu-
reau in the president's office in the
Administration building.

A letter addressed to “The Bed-
bug Professor. University of Mm~
nesota” was finally turned over to
the department of cutymology by
the partially puzzled university
postmistress.

”K
offered her the management of a
beauty studio which the store was
opening in Lincoln, Nehr. To pre-
pare for this work she studied un-

der Lorenzo, expel-t cosmetician
and hair styler.

Comments of

the Readers
\

Dear Editor:

I was greatly interested in an

editorial that appeared in a recent

issue of the Scarlet and Black
which is well summarized by the
following quotation:

“It is this lack of organized
leadership from within the ranks
of industry itself that is one of
the outstanding factors contribut—
ing to the prevalent indifferent
attitude which most of the mem~
bers of the senior class have to-
wards the work of the vocations
class. This problem must be solv.
cd if the class is to continue.“

It holds a large amount of
trutll, but it has missed the fund-
amentai problem. The point of
causation has been misplaced. We
need go no farther than the cam-
pus itself to find the fundamen-
tal cause, It rests in the lack of
vocational guidance given to the
students of Grinnell.

Grinnell is primarily and euen-
tially a liberal arts college. a non-
vocsticnal school, but to one stu-
dent who plcns only four years
of college, there is a limit to the
relative‘ return of this type of
training compared with a. more
concentrated and specific training.
A broad knowledge of the arts,
an introduction to many sciences,
these are indispensible to the
well-rounded and developed man
or woman, but the other is ab
most equally indispensiblc and a
balance must be found. There
cxlsts a very definite lag in the
latter here at Grinnell. This is
the fundamental cause of the
acknowledged indifference shown
by me senior class toward the
work of the vocations class. which
is the problem.

"Be organized. Know where
you are going," as Prof. John P.
Ryan phrases it, is the thing that
must be achieved by the student
and this can be done only with a
certain amount of guidance. What
is the solution? It is not for me
to outline a plan in this short
letter. A course for underclass-
men giving one hours credit
would help; it could not achieve
the whole purpose. Some supple-
mentary plan giving more per-
sonal attention is necessary. One
thing it would accomplish is an
earlier introduction to theprdu
lcms facing the graduated college
student who either is looking for
a. job or has found one and is
trying to hold it. The earlier the
student realizes these problems,
the more time he will have to
prepare to cope with them.

The problem may be compared
with a simple bargain between
a buyer and a seller. We are the
sellers and if we have nothing
fairly definite in mind to sell, an
.attitude of uncertainty and non~
aggressiveness imparts indiffer-
ence to the whole idea, of voca-
tions. Not until late in our sen-
ior year do we fully realize that
we must earn a living for our—
selves, and bread lines present a
most unattractive solution.

As scllcrs we are the ones to
take the initiative, the aggressive
action; industry will not come to
us. except in a few cases such as
General Electric. This is the ex-.
ceptiun, net the rule. It is not
the problem of the vocations class
to concentrate its effort in mak-
ing industry better buyers, but.
coordinated with the school, to
make the students better sellers.

R.W.E.
