Will Secure Re-election in 1936

Scarlet and Black Poll
Reveals Opinions
of Faculty

By Jerome D. Newcomer
(Editorial Chairman of the Scarlet
and Black)

That Franklin D. Roosevelt will
be re-elccted president of the
United States is the prediction of
73 members of the Grinnell college
faculty and staff interviewed dur-
ing a survey made receritiy by the
Scarlet and Black to determine na»
tional political trends on the cam~
pus. Only two persons believe that
the president will be defeated,
while 19 others failed to express

an opinion.

An even larger majority voted
yes on the question, “Will Roose-
velt be renominatedlu Ninety said
yes; three said no.

Despite rumors that Roosevelt
has lost gmund since 1932, the
campus survey revealed that the

ANOTHER POLL COMING

Does the Grinnell faculty be—
lieve that prohibition repeal has
been a success? What are the
faculty views on capitalism and
socialism? Does the faculty fa-
vor any change in the electoral
college system in national elec-
tions?

Scarlet and Black for the an-
swers to these questions.

president has gained in popularity.
At the time of the last national

vored Hoover; as. Roosevelt; and
14. Thomas. According to the poll.
45 persons now favor the re-elec-
. tion of President Roosevelt, while
only 26 designated that they will

the field. Twelve persons were non»

The question, "Has the New
Deal been a success?” was an.
swered along party lines. Six Re-
publicans said yes; 26 said no;

lthe non-partisan voters and the

Socialists gave the New Deal a
majority of 52 to 35.
Lock of interest Shouni

Something besides political
gains and losses is revealed by the
survey. A total lack of interest
and knowledge of politics by a big
majority of women interviewed
was astounding! oiic housermother
frankly admitted that she never
wanted to vote again in her life.

Another house-mother said that
she wasn't in a position to state
her party politics because her
father had been a Republican and
her husband a Democrat. She ad-
mitted that until her marriage she
had voted Republican, and after
her marriage she had voted Dem-
ocratic. Since his death, she has
generally not voted, she said.

“Queer Sort of Person"

The head of one department,
who refused to part pate in the
poll, stated that she knew nothing
about national affairs. “I would
like to see someone who does." she
said. “He would be a queer sort of
person."

The Republicans hold a 14 vote
lead over the Democrats in the
number of party members, but the
nonpartisan voters control the
balance of power. There are 32
Republicans, 19 Democrats, seven
Socialists, and 36 Independent vot.
ers here.

Lowden, Landon Favored

Both Republicans and Indepen-
dents alike agrecd that if a Re-
publican by any chance might suc-
ceed Roosevelt as president in
1936, they would want that man
to be either ere-Governor Frank
Lowden of Illinois or Gov. Alf.
Landon of Kansas, both of whom
received 12 votes. According to
Miss Eleanor Lowden. sister of the
former Illinois governor and head
of the Grinnell department of Eng-
lish, her brother will not accept
the Republican nomination should
it be offered to him. "He is in
good health." she said, "but the
strain of the work of the presiden»
ey might be too much for him. for
