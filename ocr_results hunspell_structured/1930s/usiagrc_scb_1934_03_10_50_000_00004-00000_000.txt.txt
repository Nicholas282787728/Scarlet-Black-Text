Enthusiastic Youths

In the country of the “great ex-
periment," she was impressed hy
the enthusiasm of the young Rus-
sians, or “Commusols”, who were
studying to become members of the
Communist party.

“Only a small percentage of the
people of Russia are actually mem-
bers of the Communist party," she
said. "while many of the younger
Russians are studying for admit-
tance. In some of the small agrar-
ien villages, there were still older
people who refused to enter into the
Stalin government. and who frankly
admitted that they wished to have
their ‘own cows and own sheep.’ H

Ambassador Owens

Leaving Russia in August, she vis-
ited in Sweden and Denmark. and in
Copenhagan was the guest of Ruth
Bryan Owens, American amhassador
to Denmark. ”The Danes greatly ad-
mire Mrs. Owcns," she said, ”even to
the extent of imitating her walk
and her manner of dress.”

Speaking of the international sit-
uation she said that war clouds do
not seem as threatening ‘11 Europe at
present as they dirl last summer, but
hastily added that she was no author-
ity on the subject.

She will leave Grinnell for Wash

’— Men and Women
say They Satisfy

FOR SOMETHING to “satisfy”
you, means that it pleases you
-that it‘s what you want. This
applies to cigarettes or anything.

A cigarette has to taste right—
not raw or too sweet. For a Ciga-
mile to “satisfy” it has to be mild
—ilot strong, not harsh. ‘

You can prove for yourself

whether a cigarette is milder—
whether :1 cigarette tastes better.

And it’s because smokers
can prove these things
abozit Chesterﬁeld that so
many men and women
say they satisfy. Try them.
