Veteran Backﬁeld

It is extremely likely that the
backfield will be composed entire-
ly of the veterans Capt. Preston
Evans, Snow, Sampson, and
Schlotterbeck, but Fred Homan
may get run in, and, while he
probably will not start, Vern
Robinson will see plenty of ser-
vice as field general

There is much to be said im-‘

mediately for this year‘s Pioneers,
They have come along far from
last year. Lookabaugh‘s system is
now firmly entrenched, and the
boys have mastered it thorough
ly. More than that, they have ads
variced as individuals. None of
them are stars, but they do make
a balanced unit which is likely to
be formidable to any sort of oppo~
sition.

Their main weakness lies in a
decided lack of reserve strength.

Pep Chairmen )Arrcmge
Rally for Tonight

Members of the football
team and the coaching staff
will be introduced to the stir
dent body at a pep rally to be
held at 9 p, m. this evening, on
Word field, it was announced
today by Margaret Hale and
William Pedei'sen, pep chair--
men.

A “name band" will furnish
the music for the first pep
dance of the year scheduled for
4 p. in, tomorrow.

shoulder to stand the gaff in
doubt, there is nothing much in
the way of reserve strength for
the team to fall back on in case
of miuries, which are likely to be-
come a major bugaboo this year.
But ....... barring injuries we're
going to have a ball club.

As for this game tomorrowi
don't discount this Cornell club.

 

They're never weak, and this year
they’re going to send down a
strong balanced team, with blood
in their eye, eager to avenge
their defeat here last year. They
showed a great deal of power in
lettermen last week, and the ex-
perience gained in that practice

session is going to be no small

asset
BuL we'll have to wait until
tomorrow night to see.

Official Announcement

All students enrolled for prac-
tice teaching will meet in room
102 ARH Friday at 4 p m. The
meeting \VIII concern the organi-
zation for practice teaching.
