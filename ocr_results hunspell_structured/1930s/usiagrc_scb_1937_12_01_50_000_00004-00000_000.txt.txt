L0! THE GRADING SYSTEM

Perhaps the faculty of Grinnell college,
after long reading avidly the panegyrlcs of
the Department of Public Relations, has
come to believe that Grinnell should take its
place in the sun and contribute something
startlingly original to the field of education.
Perhaps the aggressive attitude has seeped
through from student organizations.
the Council of House presidents, “We want
to- do something big on this campus !" Says
the Student council, “We want to do some-
thing good on this campus !" And now says
the faculty (proudly), “We’ve done some-
thing new on the campus!" Praise be to
the faculty! The students have long
thought that something new emanating
from the faculty was impossible, Now they
are confronted with the visible evidence'that
the faculty is capable of producing an lnno-
vation.

Alas! We are reminded of Warren B.
Catlin‘s shrewd remark, “It is better to be
right than original.” We agree!

The brain child of the faculty, conceived
in an attempt to increase the accuracy of
student grades, has proved to be a
Changeling, At least the old system was
simple enough to be understood by the
faculty. Now no two professors, it seems,
agree on what the new grades mean. Open
classroom confessions by professors of
ignorance of the new system have been
common since mid-semester examinations
Surely it is not too much to expect that a
grading system be adopted that is sufficient-
ly clear to be understood at least by the
faculty, to say nothing of the students and
their parents.

'In view of the faculty‘s admitted inadee
quacy in coping with the situation a re-
vision is called for. We cannot but com-
mend the effort in the direction of pro—
gress. Yet, the new system, we feel, is
more original than salutary.

TEST CASE

Today strident opinion on the campus,
instigated by the recent series of editorials
on the cut system came to a head when the
Student council petitioned the Curriculum
committee for an audience to discuss re-
vision with a view to liberalizing the cut
system as now in effect. We commend the
Student council for their action in striving
to secure treatment more according to the
wishes of the student body. We await with
bated breath the results of the meeting.
This is a test case of student representation
in college affairs. Will the fact that student
opinion is almost unanimous in condem-
nation of the cut system as now in effect
have any inﬂuence on the committee? Is

Says ,

student representation only a gesture, or
will effective action be achieved on this
issue so near to the hearts of both students
and faculty.

Success to the Student council!

The Editors.

TWO FAMOUS VISITORS

The coming week end will be one of
interest to every Grinnellian. In addition
to the ever popular house parties Saturday
night, two world famous men will be on the
campus; Will Durant, Thursday night and
Rudolph Gallz on Friday night, It is rather
unfortunate that one should immediately
precede the other, but such a situation was
unavoidable because of the limited number
of dates available for the college lecture
course committee. We ore, however, indeed
very fortunate in being able to secure two
such outstanding men and those who take
the trouble to plan their work in order to
enjoy both evening’s entertainment will be
amply repaid,

Will Durant and Rudolph Gallz are not
strangers to the Grinnell campus. Ganz
played before an enthusiastic audience in
Herrick chapel early in January, 1929, and
Durant lectured from the chapel platform,
Friday evening, Feb. 18, 1927. At that
time he talked on “The Greatest Thinkers
in Philosophy and Science." Durant, accord—
illg to reports of his speech, gave a very
interesting and enjoyable lecture, which no
doubt will be repeated tomorrow night.

Rudolph Gallz, a naturalized American,
is both a player and a conductor. He was
conductor of the St. Louis symphony or-
chestra for six seasons early in the last de—
cade, and is at present not only famous as a
pianist, but also well known as a guest con—
ductor. He is known for his symphonic
“Animal Pictures” and other characteristic
compositions.

Will Durant, often referred to as ”tile
best educated mall in America" is the lead-
ing American philosopher of the present
day. He is not only it forceful writer, but,
as is acknowledged by those who have heard
him, he knows how to talk. He is a con-
crete speaker with a gift of eloquence and
wit and should be heard by every Grinnell
man and woman. His presence here is not
only because he is an internationally known
figure but also because he is one of the fore-
most thinkers of the day. He will give one
of his newer lectures entitled “A Blueprint
for A Better America" in which he presents
“practical recommendations, requiring no
change in human nature, and involving no
Utopia, for meeting the problems of our
biological, moral, economic and political life.”
Immediately following the lecture will be a
short question and answer period in which
it is hoped that the Grinnell students will
take an active part.

The Ganz recital is Friday evening and
starts at 8:00. Will Durant‘s lecture is to—
morrow night and begins at 7:45.

ACTION . . .

(Reprinted train the Daily O'Collegian.)

Once in China there lived a wise old mall
called Sell Chu. A great mathematician he
was. He believed implicity that life was a
pattern of numbers and if he could find the
right combination, he could foretell the fu-
ture and accomplish great things. He come
piled a long list of numbers which proved
that China could never be invaded by the
Tartnrs. His calculations were right, but
his answer was wrong, for even as he fig—
ured, he was choked to death by a barbaric
Tartar who could not add 2 alld 2.

Old Battling Nelson, one of the great-
est characters of the American prichight-
lug ring, was matched with a smart fighter,
who his manager said planned his every
move. Nelson was not daunted,

“While he is thinking how to get me,
I’ll be knocking the blazes out of him,” he
declared.

Action is not a substitute for careful
planning but the complement of it. The
person who acts wisely and at the right time
accomplishes things.

 

DORIC

It's always a little shocking to
return to school atter vacation
and find nothing changed. By
evening the room is as disheveled
as ever. Contact with turkey
somehow has not changed a sin-
glc face. The classes drag on.
We can thank God for the snow,
at least, whlch is new and clean
and pure.
.l » .

What well known mall’s house~
mother, even though she spent
the vacation out of town, is nev-
cl'lllelcss able to report with
astounding accuracy the minute
by minute vacation conduct or
the younger members of the
English staff?

What splenetic gentleman of
the same staff is rapidly becom-
ing the tobl oi' the dean of wom—
ews oirice?

which reminds us: the other
day we happened to be passing in
back of the library at an and mo-
ment. To our surprise we saw a
young member of the Romance
language department standing
below a window which contained
a young member of the library
staff. We were surprised because
the young man was Violentlywaw
ing one arm and throwing kisses
at the window with the other.
We watched with amazement for
some time, hut then unfortunater
ly the gentleman chanced to spy
us, just as his fingers had caught
another kiss off his lips and
were about to throw it, The
kiss was never thrown. It was
crushed in his fist and rapidly
put far down in his pants' pock-
et. The gentleman blushed to the
top of his head. Then, gayly and
unconcernedly, completely disre-
garding the rignro in the window
above, be sauntered away. \vishr
ing us a good morning when he
passed.

The term vacation seems to
have lost all its tormer implica-
tions of rest, at least to Grinnell
students. They return hleary-
eyed, with a lot of broken resor
lutiolls and a bad taste in the
mouth. a bit of sleep is what
they chiefly need. And your edi-
tor is no exception. Good night.

Ofﬁcial Announcement
