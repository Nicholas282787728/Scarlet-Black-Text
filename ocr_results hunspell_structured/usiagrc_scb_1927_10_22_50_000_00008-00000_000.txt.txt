“The working out of a real dunner
racy in Mexico involves (1) the separ-
ation of church and state; (2) the

breaking up of the landed estates of
the aristocracy and their consequent
distribution to the 50,000 peons in
Mexico; (a) and the breaking of the
strangle hold of American ”big Busir
ness" in mining and oil enterprises,"
Mr. Payne affirmed when interviewed
yesterday afternoon in his office.

The fear of American economic
penetration into Mexico as has already
happened in the central American
states accounts for the dislike »of
Americans there, Mr. Payne inferred
from the Mexican Secretary or Educa—
tion’s address.

Wallace Has Round Table.

From iowa’s point of view the
Round Table on agiculture conducted
by Henry Wallace, son of former Soc-
retary of Agriculture Wallace, and, at
present, editor of WALLACE’S FARM-
ER, was one of the most interesting.
:Mr. Payne believed.

“Mr. Wallace has done is good piece
of work by making popular the agrir
rcilltnl'e question in the East, At iirst
:bis Round Tables were poorly at as
red because the East is amazingl
different and ignorant of the question.
Before long, however, he attracted nt-
zention and his Round Tables got the
best press notices of the eight them.

“One of the distinguished speakers
Mr. Wallace brought was uhu
heard whose recent book, “The
of American Civi cation," is com-
manding much interest. Proie.,nr
Beard urged that the United States;

would include'a judicious balancing of =
