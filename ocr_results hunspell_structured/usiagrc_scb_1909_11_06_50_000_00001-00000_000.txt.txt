defeat Grinnell.

Turner, who started the game at leit
end, received a blow on the head in
the seventh play of the game which
rendered him unconscious. lie was
immediately taken to: the sorority
house near the field, from which he
was removed in the night to a hospi-
tal in Des Moines. Consciousness did
not return until late in the evening.
At seven—thirty he was still unconsci.
ous, although the attendant physicians
were oontident that the injury would
not be permanently serious. The hurt
was received in a play which was dis
reeled around his end Turner dove
in, and after the play had passed over.
was carried troin the field. This acci
dent, together with the first touch,
down which resulted trorn a iumble
in the first minute of play, completely
took the "pen” out or the Grinch
team, and it was not until the Second
half that they were allle to brace \ID
to their usual style of play.

a very timely address was made by
rrcsident Main at the Chapel seiviecs
yesterday morning, on matters relating
to the preservation of the Grinnell
spirit. in connection with the toothall
situation, on Allles man was quoted as
saying that there seemed to be no uni-
ty or concentration at etlort among
the players this year. it is not the
tact that Grinnell has been detected
but the reason lor dcteat that is of
real import. “The charge of lack ol
\Inity," said Mr. Main, "strikes at the
very heart ol Grinuell. Cohesion and
unity or purpose are vital to Grinnell
spirit,"

dresses of President Lowell of Har-
vard and President Nichols of Dart.

President Faunce of Brown were read,
showing that these three men all con-
sidered the restoration ol the tormcr

Program Well Balanced and Artisti-
cnlll/ Rendered—Dramatic Power

Madame Frieda Langemlorrr, the
great mezzorsopl'ana ot the Royal 0p.
era Company, who is now making is
tour oi the west, appeared in Grinnell
Thursday evening betore a splendid
musical audience.

The prime donna's vo' e is a Wond»
erinl combination oi 'eellless and
power, with a range that has rich con-
trolto quality in the lower tones and
full, ly 'cdl sweetness in the higher
tones. Elli. it is with her real tempor-
dmeut, however, that she most impress.
es her hearers. This slle pours forth
into her songin ahundanco. Her dra.
matic iorce is unusual, and she made
ellectjve use or it throughout the re.
cital.

This was splendidly brought out in
the opening aria, taken from the Fri,
son Sconce in "LeProphete," revealing
the agony of the mother and the bene.
diction from a heart smitten with sor-
row.

In the second group, the Beethoven
number was perhaps more artistically
sung than any of the entire program.
"Fruehlingsglauhe" by Schubert and
a soothing tenderness that made a.
quiet subtle appeal. “Er ist’s” was
light, and tripping, and relieved the
other more somlier numbers.

The group at English songs we of

tenscly dramatic and revealed an
