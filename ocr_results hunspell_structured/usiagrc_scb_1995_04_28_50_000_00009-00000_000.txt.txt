To the Editor

English department should
recognize, acknowledge
soidenls’ desire to diversify

I would like lothankTequiaBurt forher
article on needed expansions in the En-
glish literature curriculum. While Ms.
Bun makes several statements to which I
take exception (for instance. she implies
that nobody here has read women‘s ﬁc~
don or Ralph Ellison; or that “it is as
sumed" by Grinnell studean and faculty
that we are unable to relate to the expene
ences of at variety ol'ethnic minorities), I
think such statements are the product of
herexpcn‘encesas aﬂlstryear. lhope that
Ms. Burt's occasionally unfounded use
sumptions do not result iii neglect of the
important issues her anicle addiesses.
However, while Grinnell may be
socially liberal, many ofour departments
are academically conservative. 1 will
graduate from Gnnnell in May with a
strong background in canonical English
and American literature; however. Ihave
grown aware that I am also graduating
with one of the most traditional English
educations available to undergraduates.
While I appreciate the English depart-
ment faculty's commitment to leaching
and to quality scholarship, many of us
have felt constricted and claustrophobic
as English majors at Grinnell. Grinncll's
is a small, isolated department. and it
cannot accommodate the diverse faculty
of a larger institution, For me, time in
another English program was essential to

make up forthelirnited spectrum ofcriti-
cal perspectives andthe largely canonical
curriculum available to the English std
dcnt at Gnnnell. However, a deparnrtent
of Grinnell’s size has an obligation to its
snidents to represent the cunent expan-
sions in the field of English language
literature despite the many difﬁculties its
small size affords.

diversity; Grinnell has many professors
who incorporate minority and women‘s
peispectivcs in the texts that they choose
and the various critical stances theyadopt.
Additionally. the department has shown
interest and dedication to iiiuldcullur‘al
issues and field expansion by hiring a
number of new professors who include
texts by ethnic minorities and work with
cnucal perspectives on issues of race,
gender, sexuality and nationality. Many
Grinncll faculty members have directed
dicirattenttons to these impomrit areas of
study. Recently. I was pleased and
gratiﬁed to hear apaper Dr. Loﬂin deliv-
ered on a short story by a wellrknown
African woman writer ata recent confer-
ence on Gay and Lesbian Studies.

However, I strongly feel that the
English department, faculty and students
should examine our relationship to cur
rent trends and expansions in the field of
English literature Minority perspectives

English EPC member. I wrote a letter

encouraging the English faculty to con-
sider hiring in gay and lesbian studies for
faculty searches. Aﬁer discussion, the
English EPC decided not to endorse a

members understandably felt that the let-
ter would be received as presumptuous

Ramblin’ Poetics;

[By DAVE FRIEDMAN , , ,
Hunger breeds loneliness
in Grinnell’s Meat Market

TATE Strcct Station, where the hipsters gather for a midrweek romp.
Where beer ﬂows in a steady stream ﬂoating troubles away. It's
Wednesday and there are a couple of days left, but it‘s about time to

refuel. And in the back, where the smoke consumes, there‘s a line to play
pool, and sisters, brothers stand brcatlung anxious breaths knowing their
game is soon at hand. My quarters are next and I am ready.

Having drunk many drinks. as i had intended to do, shooting was easy;
i fell n ght into the groove. Ball arter ball fell cue to the pocket, and 1 was left
with an eight ball aimed straight for the comer. remptied my mind, took a
deep breath, and glided the cue direct from my chest, but to my dismay, to my
shameful surprise, the ball drifted left and my mouth went dry. ilowered my
head and returned to my drink. There was no sense in complaining. I had no
reason to think, The game moved on swiftly and my panner missed too. our
opponents were gaining, but my mind was on you.

I saw you come in around ﬁfteen minutes ago. but you kept your
distance, you worked yourway overslow. And I tried to ignore you, pretend
you weren'tLhere, but each time you looked. l was locked in a Stare. And we
played that game people always play, when you think what they think and
don't ever say it, And the next chance I had, I vowed to take advantage,
putting an end to the game with a simple, soft cut, I laid down the cue and
struck up a conversation.

This bar, on this night, it’s filled with an energy, and despite its clearly
misguided nature, it’s positive and it's full ofhopc and promise ofthese folks
who arestill learning so much, who are still searching forand discovering the
boundaries of themselves, And we talk about stuff which means nothing to
no one but the tone it is spoken in speaks loudly to both, and we express our
understanding in shy lookaway lookback smiles. And to my right aman gets
drunker, explaining to me howit is l wentwrong in shooting the seven before

banking the three, and I ignore his advice for his reason is twisted, bent by too
many Whiskeys soured with lemon, and before I was done he had seen

it fit to leave. With a class the nextmorning it would be too much to make
closing, so he slipped away after sipping some water, staggering home
on shaky legs, And I was drunk too, it was time for other things, soI
retired the table and sat down with you. and as the bell rang closing, I
wondered what to do. My choice was made easy when I was handed a
beer. another opportunity to avoid that fear, and the night would proceed
and I’d soon be gone. done for the evening and ready for bed. Getting
sillier and sillier as we were herded towards the door, side by side, paired
in twos we shufﬂed 'cross the ﬂoor. Stepping out in the cold dark of a
moonless night. where in the dim glow of the bar, the lonely feel their
loneliness as lovers slip away. The walk home will seem long and the bed
will feel empty. but the sunrise will bring sobriety and the moment will
be gone. And through waking eyes, squinting through the noon sun.
things will appear differently.

And it is true that the young have their youth and so much living lies
ahead, but it's hard to see thatsimple truth when you wake alone in bed.
Truth is lost in these moments of doubt, when what would feel better
replaces what matters. and what matters is this I‘m alive andl’m free, and
the world around is ﬁlled in abundance with abeauty born ofitself. And
I think of the bar where I’ll pass my night again, the dark clouds which
fill it and the laughter which rings, It‘s all an illusion, that much seems
clear, but I would rather be here living and drinking than home all alone
wishing and thinking. You can learn from anything if you're always
aware, and there‘s fun to be had in each minute and each beer. and what
I’m trying to say ifit‘s not yetclear is that you've got all you need in every
breath that you breathe, it’sJust all so much clearer when you got sweet
lovin’ keeping you busy ’til three.

riculum might seem to support that inter-
pietation. However, Ms. Bun has idenue
{led a signiﬁcant problem for the English
department, as well as other Humanities
departments. 1 hope that English majors
and faculty wtll become more wtlluig to
address these issues iii the future. and
