[An—d Onvm Your Right...

by Jim hit

You must have noticed us at one
time or another We wander around
campus accompanied by a kid in a
skirt or sport coat, Sometimes a
middlernged couple is with us.

We point at buildings and name
them We often speak seriously,
but even then we try to smile a lot.
Some of us invariably get lost in
the Science Building,

We are Grinnell's tour guides for
prospective students, on assorted
crew dedicated to an impossible
task. We try to explain the EXr
perience to people who have never
before seen Grinnell.

This is like trying to describe
sex to a celibote. e. It loses some-
thing in the verbalization,

And like sex, the Experience is
a highly personal phenomenon,
meaning different things todifferr
ent people. The only thing we can
all agree on Is that four years at
Grinnell is, indeed, an Experience.

How do guides communicate this
to ti high school senior and his
parents, people whomtheyhave nev-
er met? Guides tend to operate on
the unspoken premise that, as only
leges go, Grinnell compares pretty
well.

Given this ingrained superiority
complex, we feel free to talk about
Grinnell's problems as well as its
strong points. The Admissionsstnff,
with the some conﬁdence, makes it
clear that our job is not to sell
people on Grinnell.

Thus, if a prospective asks about
a weak department, we say that it
is weak. But we try to hook thepror
spective up with a studentmajorand
a prof, so he can decide for him
self. The only danger is falling into
the common Grinnell trap of being
overly critical.

The experienced tour guide can
immediately identify parents who
read Time magazine by their basic
taut questions about bathrooms in
coed dorms, sex in coed dorms, and
dope on campus. But once these
formalities have been dispensed
with»"Yes, Coed dorms do have
bathrooms, just like other dorms"
rthe prospective's and his parents’
questions become more difficult.

For instance, how would you desV
crime the social atmosphere at
Grinnell? You can pomt Dut cer—
tain facts, like the lack ofsororir
ties and fraternities, but you soon
find yourself stating subjective as,
:essments. To avoid this pitfall,

,Big Brothers And

by Beth Russell
and Bill Glaser

Twentyenve Grinnell youngsters
still want and need Big Brothers
and Sisters, the local program or-
ganizers have announced, The Big
Brother/Sister program, they feel,
Is a chance for students to help
townrgown relations, have some
good times, Lind bring ”a parcel of
happiness” to a young child.

The Big Brother-Big Sister pro-
gram was established three years
ago by a Vista volunteer livmg in
Grinnell. Many of the participants
who were involved in the original
program considered their experir
ences valuable both for themselves
and for the children, so they are
now desperately trying to keep the
program going. To do so, more
volunteers are needed.

The children that the program
helps are in grades one through
six Grinnell school teachers and
school counselors recommend [or

my favorite trick is to take the
prospective to a meal and invite
whomever else is at the table to
offer his opinions.

This can becomeamusing, ilsome-
what confusing, for the prospective
As often as not, the Grinnelfians at
the table wind up arguing aboutwhnt
Grinnell is really like ThiSis, hows
ever, helpful in destroying the myth
of the homogeneous Grinnell student
body.

Diplomacy and restraint are fur
ther requirements for tour guides.
How would you react to the lather
who takes you aside and asks, “How
easy is it to get laid here?" I
still wonder if I should have turned
and walked away, rather than trying
to explain my perception oi campus
attitudes and mores. The culture
gap between them and us is not
often so stark, but it is usually
present.

The job has some compensating
features, too, It is fun to talk with
someone whose viewpointandobserr
vations presentan outside perspec-
tive on college in general and Grin»
nail in particular. Talkingwitha high
school senior reminds me of the
changes I have gone through in four
years here.

I always wonder how the prospec-
tive will arrange his lite if he elr
ects to come to Grlniiell, and i
sometimes wish that I could start
over knowing what I do now. Pro»
speco’ves share the characteristic
of still being excited, if apprehen-
sive, about the possibilities pres
sented by Grinnell. I envy them
that enthusiasm, unrealistic though
it sometimes seems from my point
of view.

Most important, I think. is the fact
that in trying to represent Grinnell
to an outsider, I am forced to reach
at least some tentative conclusions
about the place. I observed in an
earlier column that Grinnellians
tend to gripe a lot while they are
here but to be happy when they re~
turn alter an absence. In trying to
sort out the elements of this paras
dox, my personal--and necessarily
tentative--conclusion is that Grins
nellians’ expectations of themselves
and of the college are high; too high
to be soon, if ever, realized. By
pursuing our high expectations we
are constantly frustrated, both
individually and as a community.

But considering the alternatives,
that sort of frustration may not be
all bad.

Sisters: Wanted

lems in school, There are many
small children in Grinnellwho come
irom large families where they get
little attention, or from culturally
deprived homes. They would bener
fit, program participants feel, from
the extra help and attention they
would receive in a onerto»one re-
lationship with a Big Brother or a
Big Sister.

The only requirement ot the pro.
gram is that‘ volunteers meet with
their little brothers or sisters at
least once a week There are no
defined activities that the program
requires its volunteers to pursue.
Some like to take theirlittlebrother
or sister bicycle riding, to the lie
brary, to the park, or to the Phys
sical Education Complex toplaypadr
dleball. The main idea is Just to
have a good time with the child

Present student volunteers urge ot-
hter students togive ail houror more
of their time each week to help
these children. Beth Russell (x559)
and,WeS Fuiii (x251) are the student
organizers.

Part II

by John Potts

We last left our heroes alter their
second album. At about this time,
they spent a good dent of time on
the West Coast and began touring
with the Grateful Dead (n little
known alliance which lends one to
speculate about the relationship bee
tween the Sweet Jane mentioned in
the beads Truckin' and the Velvet
Underground‘s song Sweet Jane). in

To the Editors

In September and October of this
year, students supporting thecanlliv
dacy of Ed Mezvinsky distributed
literature on campus which did not
state who half produced or distl‘ilr
uted it. This liceh’, the Sctiweilgel
for Congress Committee tiled
charges with the Fair Campaign
Practices Committee, reporting the
alleged violation. The apparent me
fraction by the Mczvinsky forces not
only violated the Fair Campaign
Practice Code which Mr. MeZVll‘tShy
swore to uphold, hilt is a violation
of US. Code 612 of tlie Feticittl
Corrupt Practices Act which States
that any pamphlet must contain the
names of the persons oi’coliiliiittees
responsible for the publication or
distribution of that Cit‘ciiliii‘, Two of

Throughout this campaign, there
has been an attempt by the Mezvill-
sky people to llnlnirly piclure Con»

DANCE!

Grinnell’s Folk Dance Club per-
formed twice last weekend--Friday
evening for the Foreign Language
Teachers of Iowa during their con»
vention in Des Moines and Saturday
night in Roberts Theatre as part of
the Parents and Alumni Weekend
activities (pictured), The dances
represented a wide variety of ror-
eign countries, including lsrael,
Yugoslavia, ireland, Sweden and
Germany.

The Folk Dance Group is the far-
gest organization on campus, with
well over loo members. Under the
direction of Ms. Pirkko Roecker,
they perform for hospitals, chil-
dens groups and old people‘s
homes, as well aspresentingayear-
ly public performance, popular with
much of the Grinnell population.

induced, perverse fantasy oisorts.
(But there are many other pos-
sible interpretations.)

Lou Reed is fantastic throughout
this album, In the first VU column,
I mentioned that his campy sarcasm
becomes more obvious In his later
works. Listen to him adlib rock
n’ roll cliches between lines of
Beginning to See the Light. Or the
very camp arrangement or After—
hours (an esoteric satire of night-
club entertainers). on Side Two
we find Lou Reed at his best, Candy
Says and Jesus certainly have to
be two of the most sensitive rock
tunes ever recorded. Listening
careiully to Some Kind of Love (a
song chronicling the wanderings of
a mind under the inﬂuence), you
realize that Lou Reed is mimick—
ing Donovan's vocal Style. Like~
wise, the line "But it’s truly really
a sin” irom Pale Eue Eyes is
done in perfect Bob Dylan phrasing
and inﬂection,

This album, though relatively ob-
scure, contains some of the best
Lou Reed material available. Lou
Reed, in my opinion, ranks with
Dylan, Lennon/McCartneandWinr
wood/Capaldi as one of the very
best song writers around. Icer»
tainly would be hard pressed to
name one who is much better. Be
that as it may, this album is also
signiﬁcant because it introducesin-
strumeniahon, arrangements, and
certain types of electronic guitar
effects (listen to What Goes On for,
an example ot the latter) which play
an important role in the Velvet
Underground’s masterpiece (and
commercially successful) album,
Leaded. But I’ll have more to say
about that in my next column.
