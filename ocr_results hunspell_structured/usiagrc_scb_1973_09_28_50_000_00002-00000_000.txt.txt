School Bonds Vote Oct. 3

by Sherman Boone

On Wednesday, October 3, the resi-
dents of the Grinnell area will de-
cide on an important school bond
Issue

The proposition set before the vot-
ers in the Grinnelerewburg Comm-
unity School District will be whether
or not to authorize the issuing oi
bonds by the District for an amount
not exceeding $5.385 million.

The funds will befor the purpose
oi building and iurnishing oia new
four-year “middle” school building
(for grades five to eight), plus an
addition to the present high school

building. which will have toaccomo»
date an extra 200 ninth-graders.

Remaining funds will be used to
improve and/or i-emodel several
existing elementary schools. ,
On the same aballot is a Second
question concerning the iinancing oi
these bonds. This proposition deals
’with an authorization for the Board
oi Directors to levy annually a tax
exceeding ten mills but not exceed-
ing fifteen mills on the dollar of the
assessed value of taxable property.
(A mill is worth l/iooo ot adollar.)
The Board of Directors for the
GrN school district ieel that the

money is urgently needed. The pre
sent iunior high school building is
too small tor its 670 students and
has poor acoustics and climatecon-
troi and not enough outdoor iaci-
lities to accomodate the students.
Parts oi the building are 70 years
old and general repair would be
quite expensive.

The present high school does not‘
have the proper size or tacilities
to accomodate the incoming ninth
graders in addition to its current
enrollment. The original plans ior
enlargement which wereparededown
irom $2,335 million to $11663 mil-
lion, will provide an extra 73,200
square teet oi iloor space Included
in this space will be a gym which
will seat 2,650 spectators

However, some storage rooms tor
the kitchen and physical education
equipment, parts oi the proposed
science wing. and a number oi stu
dent services, guidance, health, and
administration) facllltes were
drastically reduced iroin the ori-
ginal plan. Although there will be
an increase in student enrollment,
the present studentrfaculty ratio
(20/1) will remain the same.

SGA Meets 0n KDIC, Money

by John Turnbuii
Not Attending: James, Rawson,West

Norris
New members irom non-college
owned housing: Don Bagnanno and
Joan Pomaranc, Correction from
last week's article: it was Ellen
Rostker and not Martha Rosner
who was involved in the attack on
Craig Hobb's appointment last week.

Well, it was back to business for
the Joint Boards last week as South
Lounge regained its status as meet
ing place.

Celestine Bloomfield was back with
her Social Coordinator’s report, She
brought up a heavy question oi
charging admission to iuture pop-
ular concerts at Grinnell. As er
plained by both Bloomfield and Fa-
ust, the extra revenue is needed
to offset the currently high rates
(around $5,000) charged by most
popular rock groups, So, ior this
semester, the Social Committee will
be searching out student opinion on
the various alternatives open to
them. Should an admission price
he charged just to people attending-
irom outside the community? Should
admisSion he charged to all attends
ing? Should one malor concert be
allowed to severely restrict the sue
cial offerings from the rest of the
semester? Dr, iinally, should there
even be a concert in the $5,000
range7 Whatever is decided upon
will probably determine social por
ticy next Semester and thereafter.

Also back were the financtal prOV
blems of KDIC. The station engi-
neer, John Hansen, reported the

tuture iinancing oi the tclctypc and
equipment replacement, tine could
not help but agree with his assess-
ment that the station is “up shit
creek "

Despite wide support voiced by the
10th board ior the continuation oi
the station, SGA is no longer able
to bear the entire burden oi iinan-
cial support

Continued operations oi the station
is contingent on iinding additional
iunding Hansen noted lhllt, KDIC
has no intention of leaving the air
until there is no other alternative "

in more general action, the EPC'S
have iinally comc back Student
members'of the All Campus EPC
have been having a hard time gets
ting Mr Hamilton to “remember
how many independent study proe
posals were rejected. They are
also involved in introducing a 4+4
program tor consideration by the
college. It is emphasized that stur
dents become involved in those ace
tiohs and that the All Campus EPC
has open meetings in Btlrling base-
mellt at 11:15 every Thursday. in

addition, an ad hoc student comnii~ ,

ttcc on educational rciorm is being
set up and those interested Should
contact either Lenny Kurz or Brad
Clompus

In other action, the Boards passed
a new Set of Initiative Fund guide
lines. Author Al Goldberg expected
vigorous debate but merely receive
ed various questons regarding the
procedures ior allotment oi the
$3,000 hind. in another money mate
ter, about $125 was raised by the
t.v. Lottery.

Voter eligibility requirement for
this election are simple. One need
only to be an American citizen and
be 18 years oi age; there is no
residency duration requisite. Polls
are open on Wednesday irom 7:00
a m. to 3:00 pm. A sixty per cent
iavorable vote is required tor pase

There aren’t many houses that can
boast of having a player piano and
a coffin in their living room. Per
haps one or the other, but certainr
ly not both. One of the few, however,
is the Avant Garde Music House
at 1131 Park St.

The casual observer might think
then, that the house is somewhere
on the outskirts of reality, but
the residents think nothing of the
kind, House President Jacques
Brunswick Views the purpose oi the
house as one of exploration and
promotion; exploration oi the realm
ot avant garde music and promo
tion of this music to the campus
community, ,

“We really feel that it is impor-

tant to expose the campus to avant
garde music." said Brunswick, “bee

cause very iew people have any
idea of what this music is all
about”

“We're in this house to get out
oi our own particular grooves and
apply ourselves to music in a cote
lective effort," commented Betsy
Holt, one or only two Music majors
in the house.

Although nearly everyone in the
house plays some sort oi instrur
ment, be it bathtub or spoons, some
unity is derived irom a “house”
independent in, naturally, avant
garde music. Their adviser and
house sponsor is Eric Jensen oi
the Music Dept. Once a Week intr
erested residents meet with Jeni
Sen to discuss and listen to imr
provisational and avant garde mu-
Sic. '

Jensen, himseli quite experienced
in the avant garde field, has proved
quite an asset to the house. At a
weekly meeting he played several

selections lrom his own record col»
lection and tapes which he had re-
corded with various groups he has
performed with.

To further enrich the avant garde
experience, several trips to Iowa
city are planned to attend concerts,
along with meals together in local
establishments for discussions.
Moreover, an a broader scale, ar-
rangements are already underway ,
to present a multi-media concert9
on the squash court in the island
gym oi the PE. Complex, Accord-
ing to Jensen, the acoustics in the
court are excellent for this type of
event.

Avant Garde Music House began
last year as a ireshman tutorial.
Enough interest and talent was gen-
erated that the participants decid-
ed to iorm a project house this
year to establish a studio and pro
mote interest in avant garde music
Although iallowing the beliefs of
musician John Cage in that music
need not be limited to keys and
instruments, an exceptional aspect
oi the house is its player piano,
rebuilt last year by Brunswick and

: others

included in its collection of rolls
are such collections as “The Will-
iam Tell Overture" known to most
as the Lone Ranger theme; “The
Overture to the Rock Opera “Tom-
my”; “Yes We Have No Bananas”;‘
“Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar
and a Scott Joplin original, “Maple
Leai Rag.” Brunswich hopes to
start composing some player rolls
soon by simply punching holes in
a blank roll and trying to come up
with a creative composition.

AS to the coffin, it is only a i‘eaSV
unable facsimile which was built
as a prop for a student iilm which
was begun last year,
