school. but the men in Grinnell. and
I suppose in all such institutions.
seem to have to pass through a sec-
ond childhood.

AS long as the pranks of the chilr
dren remain in thc realms of fun I
don't think that any of us have any
uoyections. in fact we rather enjoy
lots of the crazy things that are done.
But. when acts of wanton destruction
are performed it is really time that
a college man stop and give the
thing a serious thought. Recently in
two or three of the buildings there
have been ﬁres, some originating in
paper—chutes and others in trash.
These ﬁres have amounted to nothing
less than incendiarism which, besides
an act of destruction and even a dan-
ger to life. are also crimes punishr
able by law.

Such things cost the men involved
and the college more than the money
necessary to make repairs. There is
the matter of the lowering of the
character ot the men and the morale
of the whole dormitory system. Also.
the effects of such incidents are tar
more reaching than merely within
the college. Do reports of such things
as these ﬁres or miniature bombings

Dear Sir:

During this year at Grinuell there
has heen called to the attention of
anyone who ever thinks occasional
serious thoughts. the .matter of
growing up. One might even suggest
to some of our college men the idea
of ”act your age but don't crawl."
According to ordinary experience a
fellow is at least supposed to begin
to grow up after he gets out of high

l Campus Opinion

Do you think that the now grading
system is an improvement over the
old method:

June Le“ : This new plan seems
to be a Step in the right direction. I
think it is quite sensible.

Elizabeth Carr: I think that the
principle is ﬁne. but I don't quite un
derstand its effect.

I’WL F. L. Bunnmnu: This system
will, I think. direct less attention to
relative rﬂnk and more to absolute
standing. It Will force closer exam-
ination of the work by both the Stu»
dent and teacher.

Robert Shoulberg: I hardly know.
It may cause some to lose their ini-
tlatlve.

Going on a picnic? Call 474 or 173

the occasion. Grinnell IMotu! Car CO.
