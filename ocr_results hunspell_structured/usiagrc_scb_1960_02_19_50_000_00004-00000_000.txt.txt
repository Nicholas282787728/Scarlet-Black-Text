Fishman Discusses
Instruments Used
In Taste Research

Why does a fruit bat eat fruit?
The Biology club was to meet in
room 141 of the science building
at 4:30 today to hear lrving Fish-
rnan (biology) discuss the ques-
tion and others as he spoke on
“Chemoreception in Small Marn—
"lab."

Fishman a currently engaged
in research on the characteristics
of the taste sense found in mam—
mals. His speech, according to
Bill Bowen. president of the club,
was to outline the research and
display instruments used.

Fishman explains his research
by an analogy to the telephone.
The receiver bears (or tastes, in
the case of his work) and then
sends a masage' through the
wires (the nervous system of the
organism) to the other end of
the line (or the brain of the
mammal).

Fishman is interested only in
the initial stragkthe actual efe
feet certain chemical molecules
have on the taste buds, Ln other
words, which substances can do
tually be tasted by the sense?
D03 the iruit bat taste only
fruit, and therefore eat only
ﬁ-uit'!

JDebal'e’ Team
"Makes Good'
In Pella Meet

Results of last; weekend’s
debate trip were rather en-
.couraging to the underclass—
,man dominated Grinllell de-
lbate teams, according to
William S. ‘Vanderpool’
(speech). ‘ l ’

In Fella, Grinnell’s ratings
lwere excellent, and the teami
‘won ﬁve out of eight debates.
The debate was not won by
any one school in particular as
ratings are the only criteria for
‘Perfonnance.

1 At Northwestern, a Grinnell

team of three freshmen and a

sophomore found itselt pitted
against seniorrdominated teams
from large universities such as
Kentucky and the us. Military
Academy. One team received
an excellent rating against thrs
opposition, but the total results
ldid not place Grinnell rn the
lwinners’ circles.

l According to Vanderpool, the
Northwestern debate proved to
be the best experience because
the teams were obligated to deA
bate both sides of the question.
