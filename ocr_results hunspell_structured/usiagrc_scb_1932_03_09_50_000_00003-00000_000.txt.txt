Campus Opinion :

Question: Do you think seniors
should be exempt from biking fiuul
semester xaniiuntions iii the spring?

Helen Bl'aclineineS, because a
senior is busy enough in the spring
without cramming for and taking exV
aminations when they probably will
have no effect upon the grades.

Moiiriuc Jones—Yes, examinations
seem superfluous except in doubtful-
cases, in which the senior should he
given a choice of taking them in or—
der to raise his grade. Why mar our
last days at Crinnell with examinar
tions that are a strain upon every-
one?

Dale Mcci~ There is little point
in having seniors take semester exV
aminations except in cases when the
grade is between passing and failing,
or when the student is taking work
under an instructor in Whose class
he has not previously been.

Helen Marr—By all means give us

Virginia naiston—It seems a good
idea. Maybe I'll be a senior some day.
