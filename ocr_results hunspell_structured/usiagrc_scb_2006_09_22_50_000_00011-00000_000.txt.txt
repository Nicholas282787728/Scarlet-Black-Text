Singin’ in the Rain
*tiiﬁ

Don’t expect subtlety and nu-
ance, but enjoy this cheerful

musical classic

The lnfcctiously cheerful 1952 Singm'm [/11 Rain
delivers a tale oflovc in the era when Hollywood ﬁrst
allowed movie stars to talk. It is a witty. energetic
classic ofoldrscllool musicals.

The plot: Gene Kelly pl t former vaudeville

singer turned silcnr film star. D ald O'Conner is his
comical sidekick and the best character in the movie.
Kelly's braindrad leading lady, played by Jean Hagen,
thinks they're engaged because she read it in a mugiir
zine. He,
however, only
has eyes for a
stage actress
and singer
played by
Debbie Rcynr
olds,

Their stir
dio decides to
start limiting
talking pier
lures. which
ls a problem
because the
Hagen char
acter has a horrible, annoying voice. You see where
this is going.

If you are in the mood for subtle performances,
nuanced dialogue and an insighthil and thought-pro-
voking storyline, this is obviously not the movie for
you

g eeful/y overdcled
romantic comedy, spirited

and a nd/f we// spent.

But if you are feeling like a gleefully overncterl
romantic comedy, spirited singing and dancing and
generally ahundant happiness, it will be an hour and
a half well spent.

The movie has a good number ofsongs, all of
them a lot offun, although one was fairly brazenly
plagiarized from cole Porter. some songs relate to
the storyline and others are just sort of thrown in
there because it was time for some singing.

However, there aren’t as many numbers as you
might expect. The ﬁlm has tar more non-musical
scenes than your average modern musical.

on the level of cinematography and production
values, the ﬁlm is surprisingly well~shot for a movie
so old, and clearly had a pretty decent budget. An
etrly example ofTechnicolot, every scene is notably
bright, colorful and lush.

And for the record. Gene Kelley sings in the rain
an hour and eight minutes into the film.

Once Upon a Time in the West

The Western genre at its finest

Sergio Leone is renowned for elevating the West-
ern genre to the level of art, largely because of core

whose credentials also include The GUM. My Bad, and

Claudia Cardinalc plays a woman with a shady
past, Jill, whose family is shot on the very day she arr
rivcs outhst to begin her life as a homesteader. Soon
an unnamed character (The Man), played by Charles
Bronson, enters her life and the story progresses along
the lines of a classic tale of revenge for both char-
actcrs. The Man allies himself with Jill as he tracks
down Frank, the cold psychopath who killed her {arm

ily (played brilliantly by Henry Fonda), leading to a
final showdown that only Leone could orchestrate.

Leone, who specializes in stunning Cinematog—
raphy and rich Visual detail, is certainly not afraid
to make a bold statement with his movie. The film
strctchcs almost three hours in length and is sparse on
dialogue.which might bore some viewers.

Om Upon a Time in 1/): West is a treat fol mov-
ie buffs, since Leone does not baby his audience by
handing them the story Wrapped up in a neat pack-
age within the opening scenes of the film.The movie
unfolds slowly with bursts of action snapping onto
sciccn when one least expects it, allowing viewers to
focus on the beauty of the visual product and com-
plexity of the story.

Om: U/wn a Time in the Walt rests comfortably at
the top of the Western genre as a classic. It contains
all of the elements one might expect: a dubious hero, a
truly evil villain and plenty ofquick-druw showdowns
packaged in a beautiful example oiartrul ﬁlmmaking.
It is truly a masterpiece.
