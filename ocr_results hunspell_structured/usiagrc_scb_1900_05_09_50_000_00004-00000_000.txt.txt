Professor Johnson‘s Lecture.

The thud number on the Uni-
vcx'sity Extension course ct lcc-
tures given by members of the tac-
ulty. was delivered in the college
chapol, last Monday evening. by
ProlessorAllanJohnson. Hissub-
jcct was “Side-lights on the Reign
of Louis XIV.” Professor John-
son ﬁrst sketched the character ot
Louis. a man with little cdncation
and devord of genius, but‘probably
the most absolute monarch and the
greatest exponent of thc divrne
light of kings that ever lived. IIe
ruled overaltiilgdom divided into
two parts: a noble class of 300,00o.
living in case and luxury, and 25,-
000,000 peasants whose trnrepaid
labor supported those who posed
as their superiors.

The whole system of govern
ment was despotic. At the court
King Louis was the center about
which everything moved. Each
nobleman on his estate was a min
iaturcLouis. Thepeasant,gronnd
down by a system or lendal taXr
ation, had no alternative save to
live in misery. In a year's time
many thousands died of starvation.
The whole course of king and nor
bles was one ct unreasoning and
heartlessoppression. Tbehistory
oi the years succeeding the revs»
cation of the Edict of Nantes is
only an instance of the miseries
which the people at Francc, more
especially the Huguenots, wcrc
compelled to endure at the hands
of the king and his agents. It was
a succession of lules such as this,
which brought about the bloody
day or rcckoningin 1789.

The lecture, in addition to being
a very careful study ot the social
conditions of this period of French
history, also brought out many in-
teresting tnctsconcerningthe man-
ners and customs of the time, and
was made still more attractive by

 

descriptions of spots of historic
ilttelcst, which Professor Johnson
himselt had visited. The popu-
larity of the course was attested
by the large audience which lis-
tenecl throughout with marked
attention.

IQOO Picnic.

In accordance with what has her
comr: its annual custom, the class
of 1900 spent the evening of Home
Field Matt on an excursion into
the country, immediately alter
the conclusion of the last cvent of
the ﬁeld day, the members of the
class took their placesin carry-
alls, and proceeded west to the
woods near Sugar Creek. Here
ﬁres were made, and an app:-
tiling l‘epast. consisting or cclrcc,
baked potatoes and sandwiches.
was prepared, to which the hunt
gry picnicers did lulljustice. At»
ter supper was over, thc company
gathered around a great bonfire
and passed the time pleasantly

until the appearance of a threat-
cniug thunder cloud compelled
hasty preparations for return,
which was successfully accomr
pllshedbeforethe stormbroke.and
at anllotlrconsiderablyearlierthau
would otherwise have been the
case. The picnic will be remem-
bered by all who were present. as
one oi the most enjoyable ot the
many pleasant gatherings which
the annals of the class have re~
corded.

The Fourth annual debate ber
ween Beloit and Knox colleges 0C-
cured last week and resulted in
favor of the latter. Knox had the
negative of the question of the
public ownership ot the telegraph
and telephone,
