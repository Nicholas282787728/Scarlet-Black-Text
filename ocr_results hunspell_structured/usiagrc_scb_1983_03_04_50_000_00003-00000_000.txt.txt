The initial experience of three people in
hell provides the basis for the Open Space
production of the Jean-Paul Sartre play No
Exit. This play is rich in philosophical allu~
sions which develop from the deceptively
simple dialogue.

“Sartre does not directly state his ideas
in this play. However, his ideas become
evident through the words and actions of
the Characters," stated Director LOUIS
Kersten.

This emphasis on the importance of ac
tions is a cornerstone of Sartre's
philosophy of existentiallsm. Existen-
tialism asserts that a man's actions define
his existence, and man is responsmle for
these actions.

The three principle characters of No Ex—
it find themselves in hell [or actions they

, have committed in society Through the
words and actions of the play, they move
from ignorance to a full realization of Why
these actions brought them to hell.

”The pace oi the play will be deliberate-
ly slow," stated Kersten. “We want to ems
phasize that nothing is going to stop the
slow but inevitable processes involved in
the play,"

Kersten added that, "The viewer will
necessarily become involved. if the pro
duction is successful, it will make him feel
uncomfortable as he compares his own
situation to those of the characters."

Robert Palmer of The New York Times
described The Individuals" music as “con-
cise, carefully crafted, pop rock originals,
with just enough bite in the lyrics and the
music to undercut the sleekness of the
melodies and leave the listeners feeling a
little off center."

Their initial EP, Aquamarine. was voted
one of the three best of 1881 by The Ne“
York Tiiiics. and their recent album.

play, Go to this weekend's production to
discover what Kersten calls “the
unavoidable conclusion."

An original piece of music written for the
performance by Paul Schiegel will be
played before each night's presentation.

The production of No Exit features Doug
Vickers, Christopher Taylor, Susan Merts
Zlufft and Catherine Wilson.

The production will be presented at 8
pm. Friday through Sunday in the Arena
Theatre.

New York Rocker called The Individuals
one of the city’s best hands, describing
them as a “highly creative, intelligent
band whose respect for classic pop forms
has not prevented them from experimen-
ting within these forms."

The theme of this year's Loose Hall Ball
is “A Night at the Circus," but The In-
dividuals won't clown around. “They're
sharp not esoteric, fun not depressive,
clear~cut not ponderous——and re-
juvenists, not r'evivalists."

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? ~ (1967
108 min.) '

The story of a young WASP’s attempt to
receive her parents’ blessing for her up-
coming marriage to a black man. Guess
Who‘s Coming to Dinner? is a comedy that
still manages to eifectively confront the
delicate issue of racial prejudice.

This film is notable for its all-star cast:
Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy,
Katharine l-loughton (Hepburn's realrlife
niece) and Sidney Poitier, Particularly
significant is Tracy's faultless perlorr
mance which was to be his last; he died on-
ly 10 days after the film's completion. The
ninth performance by the revered Heps
burn/Tracy team, Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner? provides a dramatic finale for one
of Hollywood's most brilliant duos.

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? — (1966,
129 min)

Described by the New York Times as ”a
magnificent triumph of determined
audacity," Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf
is the drama of an immature and
frustrated college professor and his vulgar
and frightened wile.

Brilliantly played by Richard Burton
and Elizabeth Taylor, the couple has for
years been haggling over the same pro-
blems 7 her alleged infidelities and his
sell'spitying boyhood memories.

”A violently candid" film, Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf offers a compelling look
into a dismal marriage with each partner
determined to avenge himself {or the
wrongdoings of the other. Expertly
directed and produced, this movie is a
classic.-

Marathon Man — (1976, 125 min.)

starring Laurence Olivier and Dustin
Hoffman, Marathon Man is a “visceral
thriller about a Nazi ring of thieves in New
York."

AS a history student who gets caught up
in a diamondrsmuggling operation being
planned by a Nazi refugee, Hoffman’s per»
iormance is full of the stuff of which spine-
tingling films are made.

At times a bit violent, Marathon Man has
come to be known for its famous “tooth-
drilling" scene. in preparation for this
scene Hoffman is said to have stayed up
two nights in a row in order to acquire a
gaunt and pallid look. Responding to Holi-
man's methodi Laurence Olivier is quoted
to have said, “My dear boy, why don't you
simply try acting . . . it's much easier!"

An exciting and fastspaced lilm,
Marathon Man is well Worth the time.

Small Change 7 (1976. 104 min,)

From the beginning, Francois Truffant
left no doubt that he was to be a personal
filmmaker. a director who explains perr
sonality and personal relationships and
who creates characters with whom
viewers can identify.

His first feature film, 400 ninvis, and
Jules and Jim. made this evident.

The slot) Blows. made in 1959, was an
autobiography ofrhis own childhood. Small
Change. coming much later in 1975, though
more romantic, is highly comparable in its
exploration of the lives and relationships
of a group of schoolchildren.

The ion Blows explores the effect of the
French school System on a child's develop
ment: so, also does Small Change. Another
important theme in each film is that of the
relationship between parent and child and
the relationships of children with each
other.

The film vs. at the same time. a poetic
comedy and a serious study.
