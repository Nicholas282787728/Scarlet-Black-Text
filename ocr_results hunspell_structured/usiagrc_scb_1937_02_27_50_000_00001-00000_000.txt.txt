AQGIES PLAX HERE TONIGHT
Pioneers Barely Defeat Tulsa, 26- 24

Grinnellians
Save Energy -
for Aggies

Berry, Luick Sink Shots
in Closing Minutes
to Win Game

BY SCO’I‘TY MoLEOD.

Crinnell's Pioneers saved them
selves for the champion Oklahoma
Aggies last night in the men's
gym when they played just enough
basketball toeke out a 26724 win
over a mediocre Tulsa Hurricane
team.

Playing a slow deliberate game
from the outset it was evident that
the Hurd coached cagers intended
to hold the score down, If it had
not been for Bob Berry breaking
under the basket for three slick
short shots and Wilbur Luicli tips
ping in his usual quota of re
founds, the Pioneers might have
been on the short end of the score

Use Weaving Offense

Playing their weave offense for
all it was worth, the Hurricane
slipped into a 6-2 lead at the end
of the first five minutes. Berry,
Conwill, and Hayward combined to
tie the count at six all. The lead
see-sawed until LaMasncy entered
the game just before the half and
flipped in a long shot to ease the

score or the men did not indicate
the closeness of the events.” He
pointed out that this was Iowa's
third meet of the year, while it
was Grinnell's initial contest.

Exceptional Performances.
Several of the tracksters per
formed exceptionally well, accord-
ing to the coach. Bill Blaikie took
second place in the two-mile run
by traveling the distance 20 sec-
onds faster than he had ever run
it. Luther, who hasn't practiced
the high jump at all this year,
placed second by jumping 5 feet 8

Loop Cage Crown

The league leading Oklahoma
.Aggies continued to set a torrid

pace in the Missouri Valley con,

ference last night as they downed
the once proud Drake Buldogs 33-
25 to win undisputed possession of
the 1937 basketball title.

The Aggies were too much for
the Bulldogs throughout the entire
game and by the end of the first
half had piled up a 20-5 lead.
Drake came back strong in the last
half to outscorc the Aggies by six
points 19713 but the last minute
rally of the Bulldogs fell short of
the mark.

The Cowpunehers capitalized on
superior height and reach through
out the game and managed to con-
trol the tip»off and the rebounds
during the contest. Drake found
the tight defensive play of the
Aggies too much. The Bulldogs
were forced to take hurried shots
at the hoop with little luck.
Chuck Orebaugh formerly Sec—

Valley individual scoring race,
found the Aggie defense too much
for him, and was held scoreless for
the entire time that he was in
the game, He left the game late
in the last half on personals.
During the last few minutes of
play, Drake staged a desperate
