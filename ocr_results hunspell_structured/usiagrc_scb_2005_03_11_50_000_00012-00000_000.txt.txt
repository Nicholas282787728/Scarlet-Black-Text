to the outdoor season

BY KEVlN BVRNE

The men and women's track and
field reams finished their indoor sear
sons at Illinois College in Jacksonville,
Ill. last Siiltlrd‘li’rThC event was the lir-
door Midwest Conference Clianipioiv
ships, and both squads were looking to
finish the season on a good note while
also gcttiug their outdoor season off
to a good sta at tho cud ortlrc day,
the men's team had frnrshcd third; the
women fifth.

For rhc men’s tcam, it was the fourth
consecutive time they had placed third
place. However, the finish was not or
grcat importaucc for lrcad coach Will
Freeman, as thc tcam has morc impor-
tant meets down the road.

“I was pleased said Freeman We
are totally focused on outdoors and our
training indoors reflected that. For in-
stance, we did not run intervals on the
indoor track due to
potential injuries to
legs.\Ne pay a bit or
a price for that, hut
it keeps us hcalthy
outdoors. There
were some areas
that we could have
scored better, but
allrinrnll it was a
solid performance."

Mitch Heiz ‘05 led to way for the
Pioneers in Jacksonville, running to a
secondtplace finish in the 800 meter

run (1:55.66) and a ﬁfth’pl‘rlcc showing .

in the 1 mile run (4:26.03). He, along
with Kylc Perry ‘08, Patrick Lainc ‘08
and Desire Takawirarn ‘06, claimed a
2005 MWC Indoor Championship in
the men’s Loco—sprint medley.
“Overall, 1 was plcascd with my
times," said Herz. “I ran well in the
every event cxccpt thc rnilc, coming
away with a career personal best in the
opcn 1300. Although I drdn't achrcvc

the team recovered
well from bad events
and pulled a couplc

Meanwhile, the

than they had the year before, but per-
formed better overall.

“I was pleased With our team’s suct

coach Evelyn Freeman. “We finished
firth this ycar bur scorcd 19 points
more than we did last year at fourth
placc. wc arc a more wcll-tourrdcci
tcam, although we do have a row holes
in some ﬁeld events, but we're. working
on that."

"Wc had varying personal goals and
met many of them, said Groves “We
put forth our best efforts. ran with our
hearts, formed stronger team bonds,
and had fun I view the indoor season
as a period ofprcparation for thc out-
door season, so I am thrilled with the
progress we already made."

Both [cams will now prepare for
the spring brcalt trip to Gaincsvillc,
Fla.This will be a time for preparationr
team bonding, and a little competition
to prepare for the outdoor season.

“Although wc will cornpctc in two
meets and should get some good carly
season marks," said Will Freeman, “we
are really there to take advantage of
good weather and great facilities. It is a
big tcaching period for our skill events.
The team and the coaches work hard
and a lot is accomplished. It also helps
to help solidify the team dynamic."

Although Grinnell
consistently ﬁnishes

in the top half or the

Monmouth is the team
to beat. Not only have
the Scots dominated
track in the last decade,
they also swept the
Indoor MWCS for the
fourth straight year last
weekend. Recent history
also suggests that Mon-
mouth has the edge in
the upcoming Outdoor
