about it.

With the recent shift in admissions, more
proactively seeking out students of higher eco-
nomic strata, and consistently increasing tuition,
there’s been some apprehension on campus that
the student body will become more homoge-
neous. Is there a similar apprehension in the
administration? In what ways are such moves to

the beneﬁt of the institution?

First orall, we've failed miserably at increaslng the number orriill.»

In light of this, what do you think is the role of
the student voice in shaping administrative

policy, and what should it be?
I think there's a large student voiee involved in the governing or

the institution. The president and vice—president ofSGA now sit at

prooess, as the reprmcntarivc from die students. In some ways, 1 think
studeno resently have been more involved. in terms orsrudenr life,
we've always wanted to have good student input in terms ofwhat we
do. That's why we're doing the roeus groups 1 think that it's a plus, I
like to hear student input, I like to hear what's on the minds orstue
dents and I think that will Contlnuc. I’ve been here a long time, I’ve
maintained the self-governance process. There were many points
where we eould have changed it, and felt that it would have been a
bad idea. It was one or the reason: why Grinnell attraeted me in the
first plaee. I was an RLC in the residenre halls for three yeais. What
was attractive about the position was that I didn’t have to spend my
time doing discipline, whieh was a major eharaereristie orodrei hall
direetor yobs elsewhere. I think that student voiee is important, and
at high levels it's been inereased. We now have trustees that tome
and hove open forums with students. Five, six. seven years ago, that
didn't oeeur. My doors always open. students ean always come in
and talk to me about stun.

As a key personage in the steering of Grinnell
College, what would the ideal Grinnell be in ten,
twenty, thirty years?

I would like to see us rinaneially sound. When I that eanie to the
eollege, the endowment a was $100 million. we didn't have a lot of
money; it was dimeult to do things with limited budgets. I've seen
the college take olrwith the large endowment, I think we need to
maintain our ﬁnancial aid program. I think we need to bring in top
qualll’y students and make sure the student and aeademie experience
is ofthe highest quality here. I would still like us to be one orthe best
liberal arts colleges around, Grinnell has a very solid and long Eradi»
tion ofsocial eommiiinenr and social action, I think that’s important
for the future. 1 wouldn't want to see the oollege shirt its values. I
think our values are very sound: we know who we are; ive know why
we're here; and we know what we want to do. very dearly at the top
orthe list is being a highly aeodemie institution. and olrering a top
notch education.
