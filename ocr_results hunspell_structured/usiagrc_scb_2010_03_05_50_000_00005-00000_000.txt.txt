Senatorial candidate visits campus

BY CHRISTIAN CAMINITl

Democratic US. Senate candidate Roxanne Conlin kicked
off her college tour last sunday, Feb. 23, by hosting a town hall
meeting at Grinnell College. Despite an adequate onecampus
publicity effort by the College Democrats, the meeting at-
tracted a mere fortyesomething peopleiless than a quarter of
the initial estimate given to the Conlin campaign.

“Its difﬁcult to herd Grinncllians,” said Matt Horowitz ’10,
member ofthe College Democrats.“The town hall meeting
worked to jump start awareness ofRoxanne on campus. She’s
gaining name recognition and hopefully people are getting
excited."

As staﬂ’ers scrambled to rearrange furniture in Loose
Lounge so the room didn't appear quite so empty, one couldn’t
help but recall images of Conlin's general election opponent,
ﬁveetime Incumbent Senator Chuck Grassley, speaking to
ﬁlled parks and auditoriums.When Conlin linally took the
stage and began to speak, the welcome music continued to
play over the loudspeakers, effectively drowning out her ﬁrst
few sentences. With the bells and whistles in shambles, Con—
lin would have to salvage what promised to be a train wreck of
a public appearance with her own substance.

Conlin, a practicing attorney from Des Moinrs, spent
the ﬁrst portion of the meeting delivering an extended self-
introduction. As one of the ﬁrst women ever to be appointed
a United States Attorney, Conlin was responsible for promot-
ing environmental protection, guaranteeing victims’ privacy in
rape cases, jailing heroin dealers and prosecuting whitercollar
crime and corruption in public since. In addition, she served
as the ﬁrst female president of the Association of Trial LaWe
yers of America. Detractors Will inevitably point to her record

as a trial attorney to paint Conlin as greedy and self-servingi
it will be interesting to see, in the coming months, how such
representations will combat the populist refrain that Conlin
trumpeted throughout the night,

Conlin then opened the meeting up to questions, the most
pressing of which was how she will defeat Grnssley. Grassley,
who has been active in Iowa politics for over half a century,
has served in the Sentate since 1981. Recently, he attracted
both praise and disgust across the nation by inserting himself
loudly into the debate over President Obama’s Healthcare
plan and coining such phrases as "death panels” and “pulling
the plug on Grandma."

In 2009, Grassley's approval rating dropped from 7s per
cent to 57 percent, with only 39 percent oflomns supporting
Gtasslcy’s role in the Healthcare reform. It is in the Health-
care debate that Conlin sees an opening against the well-
established and well-funded incumbent of almost 30 years.

“Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. It is immoral not to
have healthcare in this country,"Conlin announced proudly
to the rooms applause.“And Grassley's record is indefensible.
“We're not going to match Grassley dollar for dollar so we
need people power. It rs all about showing up.”

In an interview after the meeting, Conlin went on to stress
the importance of the college vote.

“Obama showed the Way,” Conlin said. “It's extremely
important. We care about the same things as college students,
healtheare, the environment. And especially now: jobs, jobs,
jobs."

Ifyou are interested In supporting Conlin’s bid for the us.
senate, weekly meetings will be held at 5 pm on Mondays in
the Grill.

Census is coming

BvJAl GARG

with every new decade comcs countless fads, quirky
musical styles and hip clothing trends.While these factors
continuously change, there is one constant in American public
life that has and will continue to stay constant— the US.
Census.

Mandated by the us. Constitution and administered by
the us. Census Bureau every 10 years, the census determines
government'funding, electoral seats and congressional
alignment.

Whilc its up to the US. government to determine the
actual statistics through census reports, the local governments
play an essential role in the process.

According to the Ryan Ness, the Building and Planning
Assistant for the City of Grinnell, Grinncll sends the U.S.
Government a map ofthe boundaries ofGrinnell. Once
that is determined, it is important for those addresses and
boundaries to be veriﬁed.

“Addressing is the next phase of [the project], they gave
us a list of addresses, and then have somebody,a nonecity
employee, go out and canvass the city,” Ness said.“Doing
that, you can imagine problems come up, a house not having
a number on there or a property that doesn't meet the current
usage.

Once the canvasser ﬁles the reports, the city can then
challenge the rulings.

"You get an [oli'sheet] and we can petition the addressing
ifwe like,”Ness said. “We petitioned about 30 addresses total,
that we went through and Veflﬁtdﬁl trailer that didn't have
the right address, stuff like that.”

At that point, the local government has to remove itself
from the processThat being said, there am certain things the
city ofGrinnell can verify.

As far as any demographic changes, according to Duane
Neff, Director ofBuilding and Planning for the city of
Grinnell, the population will most likely go up by 100 people
since 2000.

And lfyou students were wondering, you will be counted
as a Gtinnell, Iowa resident.

“The census rs based on where you are living and ifyou
living there nine months of the year,“Ness said. “I remember
when I was in Missouri for school I ﬁlled out the form, so
[the college students] do get counted."
