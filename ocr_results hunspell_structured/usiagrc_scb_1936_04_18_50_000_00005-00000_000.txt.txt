American Hunting Tame
Compared to Shark Hunts

Albuquerque, N. M., (ACP)7
Any hunting that is available in

America is fairly tame comparedl

with the exciting sport of hunting
sharks from an open boat, accord-
ing to Bill Baker, Hawaiian stu-
dent at the University of New
Mexico.

Favorite method of Hawaiian
shark-hunters, says Baker, is to
attract a few sharks with a bait
of dead pig» or a cow: leg. shoot
them with rifles or pistols, watch
them fight among themselves for
a while and then haul 'em aboard
with harpoons,

Once aboard, the fish are cut
open and contents noted. Tin
cans, bones, bottles and even old
clothes are sometimes found.

Self-Help by Students.
Thought Non-Productive

New York City, (ACP)7Deﬁnr
ite affirmations that the student
working his way through colleges
and universities is likely to wreck
his career “by the very plan
through which he hoped to achieve
success," have been made here by
Nicholas D. McKnight, associate
dean of Columbia college.

The dean believes that Selfehelp
by students is thoroughly nonrpro—
ductive from the educational stand
point.

“Xt may be that part of the an-
swer is to be found in the growing
belief that a considerable number
of boys and girls now going to col-
lege would be better off doing
something else," he said in answers
ing his own question concerning
the fate of the problem.

nation's 51 land-grant colleges
during the depression period has

Interior's office of education.

Deans employed on a nineemonth
basis saw their median salaries de-
creased from 55,193 in 1928-29, to
34,187 in 1934-35, an average {le-
ci'ease of more than $1,000.

The survey showed similar de—
pl'essionrperiod slashes in salaries
paid to professors, associate pro-
fessors. assistant professors and
instructors. Full-time professors
on a nine-month basis received an
average salary of $4,278 in 1928-29.
By 1934735 their annual income
had decreased to $3,775. Those on
an eleven-twelve month basis had
their salaries cllt from $4,161 to

$3,632 over the same period of
time.

Associate professors dropped
from $3,352 salaries in 1923-29 to
$2,903 in 193435; assistant profess
sors from $2,733 in 192829 to $2,-
449 in 1934-35, and instructors
from $2,005 to $1.769 over the
four-year period.

Salaries for the present year are
higher than last year.

Columbia Seniors Rate
Own Earning Power Low

New YorkilACP)7Columbia
university seniors placed a lower
estimate on their salaries five
years after graduation than any
other class during the last‘ 15
years.

They expect that in 1941 they
will have an average salary of
$2,835, compared with $3,600 for
last year's class and $5,102 for the
class of 1934. Only three expect
