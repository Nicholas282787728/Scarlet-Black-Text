History agoui repelled itselt when
Gi'luuell deieated Amos in the annual
dual traclr meet Saturday. Two years
ago, after a struggle long to be remain
oered, Gi-innell worn by a margin of
two points. Last 3'éill' Allies was an
easy victor, this year Grinnell won by
a small margin, the score being 7-1 273
to 61 1-3. After Griunell had won the
meet or taking second in the broad
jump. giving them 69 2-3 points, Amos
torteited the haittmile reiar.

A fast track, a slight wind down the
stretch. a big crowd and two such
teams as met saturdar inalte the can

in the events was at a fever heat. Tur-
ner was set a yard in‘ the loo-yard, yet
beat his closest l'ivztl, Pitcher, decisiver
ly. In spite oi the splendid work in
the sprints and hurdles there were a
number of times that the “dope" was
upset in a manner that sent state meet
favorites tumbling. Bol‘ack’s tailure
in the mile, Clark's dereat in the pole
vault, the weakness oi the mile relay-
team as contrasted with that ot Ames
and the iailure ot the Grinnell weight
tossers to take the points expected‘ol
them in these events were surprises lit-

a trainer as Watson at the helm, and
the material he has to work with this
year, Ames becomes more dangerous
than she was last year, so tar as a
Grinnell victory in the state Meet is
concerned,

We feel considerable hesitancy in

attempting any criticism at Miss Al»
len‘s singing, which the metropolitan
papers have praised so highly, so with
this program as with the ones that are
to follow in the course of the Festival,
we shall give only the detalls as they
occur, and perhaps a few of the points
that impress us personally.

niss Allen's voice is strong and
clear, but in some oi the numbers it
was more sympathetic and satistying
than in others. This was particularly
true or the ﬁrst song or the German
group, and "Die Loreleie,"

while it showed the artist's
wonderinl range and power, was not
as 'ctiective as one might expect,
“Dors, mon Enfant" was noticeably
pleasing as well as the last number.
“A Birthday," which iormed a strong
climax and brought torth continued
applause calling for two encorest
The program as a whole was popu-
lar because of the several well known
numbers, and the many pretty English
songs which all could appreciate. One
or the most pleasant teatures was the
appearance or two Grinnell artists.
