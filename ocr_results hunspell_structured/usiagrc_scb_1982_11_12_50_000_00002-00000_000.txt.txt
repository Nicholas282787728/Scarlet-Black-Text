compr,omise drafted by SASG member
Jim Hunter, was nearly accepted' In its en-
tirety.

mitted that he had no idea how the trustees
would vote on the proposed compromise.

which was announced by the SASG at a
gathering at the Forum on Friday after

stance.

Renovation

by Jane Kaufman

Renovation of the basement of Roberts
Theatre will begin next summer to accom-
modate fire inspection regulations. This
renovation will enable the theatre depart-
ment to use more of the basement. It will
also create a temperature and humidity-
controlled room which will hold some ob-
jects of the Permanent Art Collection.

“What we've been able to do is redesign
the space so that it will be functional for
our purposes," commented Jan
Czechowski, assistant prolessor of theatre,
when Roberts was originally built, the
basement was one large open space; one
air duct and two exits were provided. In
the original structure, there were no provir
sions “for classrooms or dressing rooms,“
according to Czechowski. Temporary,
unsealed wooden walls have been built to
provide a costume room, design room and
classroom. Czechowski stated that “The
whole area has not been very adequate."

He explained, ”The two significant
things that we are doing are making a

Concerts, KD/C, receive budget surplus

by Nancy L. Radermacher

After weeks of consideration and debate,
the Finance Committee presented Joint
Board with its proposal for the allocation
of the $12,461.93 reserve fund. While the
fund's primary purpose is to provide for
unioreseen SGA expenditures, carry-over
from last year's SGA budget created an
approximate $7,000 surplus which was
made available for other student ac-
tivities. JB approved all of the
committee’s recommendations over~
whelmingly. Because they are budget
changes, however, the requests must be
approved at two meetings.

To preserve the intent of me fund, the
Finance Committee allocated $5,000 [or
the general budget, a sumconsidered suf—
ficient for any contingencies. An addi-
tional $1,961.93 was also alloted to SGA to
make up for a lower than expected income
from student activities fees and pinball
receipts.

The largest allocation for a student ac
tivity was a $2,000 increase in the concerts
budget or enrich second semester co -

certs. Explaining the importance of the in-,

crease, Fred Klatz, concerts committee
co’ch ma‘n; po
budget is not sufficient to allow for the hir-
ing of bigger name bands or bands from

te'd out that'the'cbncerts. .

While the compromise is a big step furs
ward for the SASG, it does not mean that in
the future the college plans to divest from
companies involved in South Africa. The
goal of the SASG is Grinnell’s divestment
from such companies, so the compromise
has left group members feeling amr
bivalent.

”This is not really what we've asked
for," announced Robbins at the gathering.
“Anything we’ve asked for has been a
means to an end," he continued, referring
to the group's goal of divestment.

Other group members also stressed that
the group had not achieved its goal and
that continued student support for their
position would be necessary for Grinnell to
divest. Although only about 70 people
showed up at me gathering to hear the
decision, the group claimed that it had col~

wﬂh trustees

lected over 600 signatures supporting its
divestment stance, which represents more
than half of the student population.

The compromise calls for selected
students, who will probably be SASG
members, to review and propose
stockholder resolutions calling on corpora
tions to sign and comply with the Sullivan
Code and other actions involving South
Africa. The students will work with the
Committee on shareholder Responsibility
of the Board of Trustees as nonvotmg
representatives when deciding on a course
of action involving the resolutions.

The Sullivan Code is a statement of cor-
porate responsibility for the involvement
in South Africa. Compllance with the Code
is “seen by group members as merely
another step in ending apartheid and in-
creasing public awareness oi the aparr
theid problem.

The board included in the compromise a
plan whereby students may vote for the
college at annual shareholder meetings.
The students, however, must raise their
own funds for travel expenses to and from
the various meetings and meet conduct
and policy standards as set by the Commit-
tee on Shareholder Responsibility.

Robbins said that the strongest part of
the compromise is that the trustees have
stated that they will oppose actions by cor—
porations that directly support the laws of
apartheid. Robbins defined these objeo
tionable actions as ones which provide,
direct monetary or technological aid to the
South African government. He allowed
that this could be a gray area and will have
to be “worked out by precedent.”

The next step for the SASG will be to
begin work on proxy resolutions for future
shareholder meetings.

classroom and shifting storage around so
that we can set aside a large
classroom/rehearsal space," Czechowski
emphasized that space will be more effi-
ciently used The area directly under the
stage will be used for storage. This will
facilitate the transport of heavy o
from the basement to the stage by utilizing
the trap doors.

“The dressing rooms will be closer to the
stage. The costume area will be enlarged a
little, There will be more costume storage
and scenery storage area," Alexander
Moffett, protessor of theater, explained,
“I mink it's going to be an improvement
over what we've had," stated Moffett.

Richard Cervene, professor of art and
curator of the Permanent Art Collection,
cited a need for a temperature and
humiditycontrolled room for many of the
Alrican works of the Permanent Art Cola
lection currently being stored in a room
without air-conditioning. “During the sums

mer, some of the African Art objects have-

outside the Midwest. While the committee
has been trying to hire reasonably priced
bands, Klatz added, “Sometimes they
suck. ” In addition, Klatz stated that Darby
is “the worst facility in the world unless
you have a good sound system,“ and mat
bands suitable for Darby would conse
quently be more costly than the present
budget would allow. Finally, he informed
JB that several dorms have requested
bands, and the present budget may not be
sufficient to cover these additional costs.
An allotment for $1,500 was also approv-
ed ior the restoration of the KDlC record
collection. Arguing tor the importance of
these funds, station manager Chris Ertel
informed JB that the station has been ex-
periencing “problems with large holes in
the record collection," and that many DJ'S
were torced to bring their own records to
the station for shows. He added that a
crackdown on record theft prosecution
and the adaptation of Kch records to
customized record Spindles would ”vir-
tually eradicate" future record theft and
protect the $1,500 investment. Finally.
Ertel asserted that a series of im-
provements, of KDIC, most notably an in-
crease in wattage, ought to be accom-

developed new cracks and particular kinds
of mold have developed on some of the two-
dimensional objects. In addition to the lack
of proper climate controls in the current
area, the current storage area is used as a
workshop for the lraming of a number of
the twtrdimensional objects in the collec-
tion. This has created dust particles that
impair the delicate surfaces of manv items
in the collection."

Cervene described the proposed room as
an “envelope ~ a room within a room ~
that will be climate-controlled.” It will be
approximately 16'x45'. He said that there
are “145 traditional African objects that
particularly need this controlled climate. .

. These objects are predominantly wood
and mixed media: feathers, painted raffia
— straw, seed pods. . . all of which are very
sensitive to climatal differences."

Cervene commented, “This makes it
possible to protect these items in the per
manent collection. I'm pleased that we’re
going to be able to go ahead with mis."

parlied with upgrading or the music
library. Ertel proposed that the money be
spent over the course or two to three years
with onerhalf of the funds for ﬁle purchase
of rock albums and the remainder to be
distributed among folk, jazz, blues, reggae
and punk albums.

GORP equipment manager Jason
Hamilton then represented his organiza—
tion's $1.0m tunding request for sleeping
bags, ski supplies, stoves and tents.
Hamilton maintained that the purchases
would “benefit a great number of
students“ because the GORP budget has
been exhausted on more specialized and
costly sporting equipment.

The fourth approved allocation was $500
to PASF for a symposium on union»
management relations. PASF Chairman
Wes Joe explained mat, due to a decline in
tunding proposals. PASF will use their ex—
cess budget to augment the SGA allocav
tion. The symposium will include guest
speakers, a panel discussion and films.

The final reserve allocation, a $400
United Way contribution to match student
earnings from the Carnival, was the only
allotment questioned by the Joint Board.

J.B. proposes

more by—laws
amendments

by Nancy L. Radermacher

Bylaw revisions once again dominated
debate at Wednesday nights Joint Board
meeting Matt Golden, proponent of both
motions first presented a new bylaw
which would require all committee
meetings to be open to the public with no
exceptions. He added that he had amended
the motion to exempt OCR and Judicial
Council due to their private nature. Golden
pointed out that the bylaw would represent
a continued effort on the part of JB to
solicit student interest and involvement in
SGA. while there was some question as to
the legality of voting on the amended mo-
tion due to Golden’s previously passed new
business bylaw, OCR Chairman Eric
Pedicini explained that voting was in order
with parliamentary procedure

Debate on the Issue centered on the prac»
ticality of me amendment, with few
members expressing support for the
bylaw. Administrative Assistant and
former lF‘C Chairperson Marilyn Zielinski
pointed out that ﬂ’le bylaw “would not
work.” She cited several reasons for her
belief, including the limitation of freedom ‘
to speak against proposals when their sup
porters are present (especially given the
small size of the college community), the
likelihood of biases resulting from a larger
number of students turning out in favor or
requests and the existence of JB as an
“ample means of appeal” from unsatisfac-
tory committee decisions. Debate soon
ended, and the motion was defeated by a
wide margin.

The next motion considered was an
amendment of Golden's new business
bylaw which stipulates that the bylaw is
“subject to suspension by a two—thirds
vote.” There was no discussion, and the
amendment passed almost unanimously.

In new business Pete Hautzinger an-
nounced his intention to present a new
bylaw motion at next week's meeting
which would change the responsibilities
ior hall presidents and require them to
write Weekly letters to hall residents to in-
form them of their vote at JB meetings. In
support of his proposed motion, Hautz-
inger said, ”i don’t want to sound sanc—
timonious, but I think it would make us a
lot more effective." _

Pedicini then informed .18 members of
three stipulations of the SGA revised cons
stitution to be considered at next week‘s
meeting. The stipulations concern brings
ing the minutes, a definite meeting time
for JB meetings and a limit in the number
of debates allowed to .13 members.

Finally, OffrCampus Non-Colleged Own-
ed Representative John Walter encouragr
ed students to talk to professors about buts

 

fer day scheduling.

Representative Michaelene Kelly opened
debate on the issue saying that the purpose
of the reserve was for “projects or func-
tions that wouldn’t happen without the
money.” She further argued that improv-
ing student-town relations could be done in
other ways and that the contribution is
“not necessary.” Read Hall President Vic
Rudolph agreed with Kelly's comments
and added that his constituency supported
this viewpoint.

Countering these arguments, Haines
Representative Pete Hautzinger maintain-
ed that the $12,461.93 reserve is a ”hell of a
lot of cas ” whose allocation consists of
“six totally indulgent items and (only) one
philanthropic item.” Mike Cameron,
Younker Hall copresident, agreed and ad-
ded that, “Being a full-time student, I
don’t have time to show the town how 1 ap»
preciate living here . . . l'd like to show my
thanks to Gl-innell.” Discussion soon ended
and the allocation passed 1&7.

. No funding requesm, one for a renova-
tIon of the skating rink and another for stu-
dent discounts at the Grinnell Cinema,
were both denied prior to the meeting by
the Finance Committee for reasons of cost
and practicality.
