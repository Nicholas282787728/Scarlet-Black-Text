College attempts to solve overcrowding

 

By Steve Clem

Despite efforts by the Commit-
tee on Admissions and Student Fir
nanciai Aid to limit the number of
new Students for the 199l»92 aca-
demic year, the campus faces se
vere overcrowding in both dorms
and classes. The latest figures indi-
cate377 new students on campus,a
number that is 12 percent higher
than Lhe admissions target size of
348.

According to John Hopkins, dis
rector of admissions, the current
number of new students on campus
is“vcrymuchasurpn'se."Thenum-
ber of applications received iii the
springorl991 was l,7l7’—lheldw—

61.4% of those applicants were ads
milledithe fourth lowest percent-
age in college historyr

Hopkins attributed two major
factors to the overcrowding Siluar
lion, “One phenomenon that
changed here dramatically was the
percentage of students offered ad-
mission who decidcd to enroll," he
said. “We then normally lose any-
where from 60 m65 deposits in the
summer melt between May and
August, while we only lost 48 this

Oda Callison, assistant dean of
student affairs and new director of
student housing, reports that 188
new students are in overcrowded
situations atthis Lime. “in my expe-
rience, this is the most crowded it
has ever been at Grinnell,” said
Callison. She poian out that the
overcrowding will be eased as
spaces become available.

Gtinnell's recentlyrappointed
Task Force [or a Stranger Multi-
cultural Community began meet-
ing this month to develop a strate-
gic plan tomake thecampusa more
culturally diverse environmmenlr
The committee, which includes stun
dents, faculty members and admin-
istrators, was created by President
Ferguson this summer in efforts to
involve the college community in
encouraging mulli-Cullutalism,

According to Ferguson, the task
force serves to reinforce a goal that
has already been in placer pro-
mote multi-culturalism in all areas
and departments of the college.
Moreover, Ferguson noted that an
appreciation of multiculturalism
denotes not only a multi-ethnic en-
vironment but an inclusion of the
international perspective as well.
She said that while the college has
taken steps toward creating a more
diverse community, Grinnell must
still incorporate a more campus-
wide efforL“lt‘s time to stop sitting
there talking about it. It‘s timetodo
something," said Ferguson.

Suggestions by the President’s

 

Committee for a Stronger Multi~'

Ethnic Presence were the impetus
for the creation of the taskforce; the

and who is not From there we will
begin to undercrowd the rooms as
spaces become available," said
Callisoni The new students have
been prioritized into categories
determining which students will
be relocated first. There are curs
rently 25 students in the worst cat-
egory, down from the original 52
students. Attrition and relocation
have accounted for eight out of 15
rooms being undercrowdod since
August 2A according to Callisotl.

“Oda Callison is doing an out-
standing job with prioritizing the
overcrowded rooms,” said Tom
Crady, dean of student affairs
“We have a surprisingly low num-
ber of complaints from students
and parents, which says a lot about
the job that Oda is doing."

Despite the current housing
crisis Crady said that plans for
the new residence hall are on
hold indeﬁnitely, ”We are in a
situation where we must wait and
see what happens. All the projec-
tions through 1996 show that the
number of college students na-
tionwide will be dropping an.
Grinnell‘s current popularity is a
tough thing to plan for,” said
Cradyr

Anita Sclow, associate profes-
sor of mathematics, also stressed
that the task force aims to make
multiculturalism more than an in-
stilutional concern and extend the
interest to the whole campus “I
think that if we‘re ever going to
change, then it should be some-
thing that people want to do—not
something dictated from above."
she said.
