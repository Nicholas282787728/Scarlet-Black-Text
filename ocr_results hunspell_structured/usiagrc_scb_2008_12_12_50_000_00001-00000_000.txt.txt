Students voice concern on pressing Student Affairs issues

By DAVID LocaN

In the midst of growmg student anxieties
about campus life, a letterrto-theredimr pubr
lished in the Dec 5 58:3 acted as a lightning
rod for student grievances. The letter, signed
by 16 professors,condemned Dean ofStudents
Travis Greene and Vice President for Student
Affairs Houston Dougharry for the purported
mishandling of the recent departure of Sheree
Andrews, a popular former member of Stu»
dent Affairs, who held the position ofassociate
dean and director of Residence Life. A turbur
lent week culminated Thursday in a campus
wide forum to address concerns between the
student body and the adminisrmtioii.

Following the letters publication, Plans—
the college’s unaffiliated cyberrfolumi
erupted in a ﬂurry of discussion about Ans
tlrcws' departure and general student affa s
concerns, with most Plans posters condemning
the college’s administration ar-largc Students
increasingly warned that Student r\ffairs was
“changing" and that the future of selfegovsre
mince was at risk.

in addition to the letter, students heard that
members of ACE security might be at some
lounge partic- Rumors circulated that Greene
had disrupted a party earlrcr m the u and
that North East RLC Ch » Byloii had in’
stituttd it more draconian cnlorccmcnt of the
College alcohol polictes. Arid rrrorc recently,
there were suspicions that the role of student
Advisors would be changing for the wotse,

“Tlicsc people came in out oftlic blue and
started changing thi gs as soon as they got
here The new adi tion is focused on
professionalizing positions we already had,”
said Charlie White '09 in an interview with
the 5M3.“lntcrptet that as you wrii. but to rue
wt: don’t really need this profassionali’ tion

As students it makes the administration seem
less approachable, it enforces a divide between
the administration and students."

Greg Hudson '09 saw Andrews’ recent dcr
parture as exacerbating existing student con-
cerns about the future of Smdent Affairs. “1
think there’s a general feeling of anxiety about
the future of self-governance at Grinnell, par-
ticularly as it regards alcohol consumption,”
Hudson Said, “And because Sheree was so unr
derstanding about the culture of this campus
and what students do, I think it's reasonable
to be afraid that her personnel change is part
of a broader agenda and the implications
that has for selfvgoveinancc, obviously, can be
frightening.”

In response to growing concerns, members
of SGA Cabinet organizcd an open forum
Thursday to which they invited students, fac—
ulty and administrators to dispel campus ru—
mors and increase communication.

Tire forum was attended by roughly 300
comliiunily members, most of whom were

tors, including President Russell K, Osgood,

pertaining to Student Advisors.

Students primarily directed their-concerns
at Dougharry and Greene, both ofwhom were
hired within the past year.

Much of the early part of the forum fo-
cused on clarifying recent policy changes and
dispelling campus rumors.

Administrators informed audience mem,
bers, for instance. that the presencc of ACE
Security at lounge parties was entirely volun-
tary and that it had only occurred twice so far.
The proposed changes to the Student Staff
positions which had tanlded many were, ac
cording to Gleene, not gorng forward, (See
Student Stilffpg. 1)

The forum illustrated a general lack of
communication between students aiid admin-
istrators,

Diicctor of Scivicc and Social Commitment

Letter sparks
administration-
faculty debate

EV PitTlt [CK CALDWELL

At 4:05 yesterday afternoon, many stu-
dents and professors did not go their separate
ways as they normally might after classes end.
instead, botlt students and faculty headed for
JRC 101 [0 a SGArsponsorcd discussion on
the culture and values of Grinnell,

The event arose after a letter published in
last week's 5&3 by 16 tenured faculty mem-
bers criticized the manner in which Student
Affairs and the President handled former Ase
soctatc Dean and Director of Residence Life
Sheree Andrew’s departure from the Student
Affairs office. Thursday's discussion—which
sought to include students, faculty, and ad mine
istratorsiwas intended to foster dialogue on
the standing ofself-governance and the recent
changes in the administration.

Topics of conversation during the event
were mostly driven by student questions. But
the most heated exchanges of the evening ocr
curred between faculty and Vice President
for Student Affairs Houston Dougharty. In
what the modemtor had initially called the last
statement of the event, Dougharry responded
directly to the letter’s allegations,

"As the person who has taken the personal
brunt of the letter to the editor last week, I
would encourage us all to be the critical think-
ers that Grinnell wants us to be and not take
everything at face value," Dougharty said at
the forum. “I would want you to know that
not everything in that letter is true and that
there is a lot not in that letter."

After Dougharty’s comments, discussion
moderator MarkWilcox’O? decided to extend
