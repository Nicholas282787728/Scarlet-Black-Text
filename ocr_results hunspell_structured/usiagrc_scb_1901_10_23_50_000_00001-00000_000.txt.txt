First Game on the Home Grounds—Des
Moines has a strong Team; Coached
by a Grinncll Alumnus.

On Friday at 4:15 Giinnell will
meet Des Moines College at ward
Field. On account of the cancel;
lation of the Minnesota game a
space or three weeks was left tlurr
ing which the 'Varsity had no
games and it was thought advis~
able by the management to have
a game this week. Already bee
tween one and twohundred namcs
have been secured to guarantee
expenses and it is hoped that an
exceptionally large clowd will
witness the game. This and the
game with Simpson will bethe
only games on the home grounds
this year and Friday offers the
ﬁrst opportunity of showingvour

College though not a large school
has a strong and plucky team
whose weight is about equal to
that of Grinnell. They are coachr
ed by Charles E. Lynde; ’96; and

The committee in charge of
the lecture course is hav-
ing sonic diiﬁculty in securing a
place for holding the entertainr
mellls; It wasthe hope of slur
dents and townspeople alike. that
when the new opera house was
completed, all the college enter-
tainments would be held there,
but it now seems probable that
the lectures .\vi|l be held in the
church as formerly.

THE MINNESOTA TRIP.

It was not until late in the after
noon when the train was well on
its way through Minnesota that
Manager Spaiiltliiig received no
tice that the game would not be
played on account of the death oi
the university's great rrientl and
benefactor; Ex-Govcl'nor I’ills-
bury. The crtortsotihenianager
to arrange for another game at
this late hour were fruitless, o_wing
to lack of time for atlverti. ing the
game. Otherwise we might have
played Carleton at Northﬁeld, but
as it was the team had to content
itself with the prospect or an imr
mediate return to Giinncll.

When the city was reached the
squad repaired to the Nicollet
where supper was eaten and prepr
arations \vcrc made for the theatre
party that itrllnwcd. After the
night's rest and breakfast. they

on board for iwclve hours; With

ATHLETIC UNION DUES MUST BE
PATD

The Des Moines game and iii.
ture games will not be counted
on requirements for winning the
honor "G" if Athletic Union dues
aie not paid. After cuiisldeiing
the matter the board of control
has decided upon the above action.

It has been veiy difﬁcult to get
Athletic Union dues paid up or.
time arid tlils seems to he the
best means of bringing the matter
sharply to the attention of every»
one. The Union, as all the meme
bers know. is already in debt and
needs every cent of the money
that the dties will bring in. So
that men who are candidates for
the "G" should be very careful
that such a small matter as Union
dries should not keep their name
off the honor roll.

LETTER FROM PROF. NORRIS.

in yesterday's issue of 27m Gnu-
nr/l Humid appears an interesting
letter from l’iofessor H. W. Nola
ris. who is now in Germany. The
letter gives an interesting account
or Prolessol' Norris' experiences
while visitingthc Primary Departs
mentof a German Folk School.
This is a school for the poorer
glasses of German children and
gave Mr. Norris an insight into
the workings or the German edu
cational system.

The discipline and methods of
instruction are very different from
those in America. rind the descrip-
tion given is very interesting to
American readers.
