“The war ought not to be a surprise to anybody. It just
happened sooner that expected,” he said.

“We are going into war from a running start. The action
has served the purpose of making us move in a concerted
way. It may be paralleled with a football team which has
been losing all afternoon. They have been trained and have

all the signals straight, and sud.
denly something happens and
they really begin to move,”
Stevens asserted,

“It's the one thing that could
have brought complete fusion of
all political parties,” Stevens con-
cluded.

Those Holding
Private Permits
Also Affected

The war has grounded Civ—
ilian Pilot Training students
on the campus, and all pri-
vate pilots in the country,
except those who are con—
nected with comme ial lilies,
Grant 0, Gale, director
C. P. T. on the campus, an-
nounced today.

The reason for this ac-
tion was explained by Gale
as a precaution against
Sabotage. “Someone might
take a bomb up with him
in a small plane and cause
considerable damage by
dropping it on a defense
plant,” Gale said.

Gale said he had tallied to
Virgil Bayne, C. A. A. supelu
visor ill Des Moilles, and re—
ceived the announcement
from him. No i'ulther infor-
mation about the exemption
of C. A. A. students was re-
leased, he said.

Up to the time war was
declared all flying- students
were exempt from the draft,
but no ofl'icinl rule has been
stated since the declaration
of war pertaining to this
exemption, he added.

Positlon of Draftees Clarifed

Seniors May
Take Finals
In January

With the United States dec—
laration of W l‘ against Nip—
ponesc Imperial powers not
12 hours old, the position of
Grinnell senior men subject
to the draft call was partially
clarified at a special faculty
meeting yesterday afternoon.
Seniors who xpect to be
drafted for militaly service
before next Julie, may take
comprehensive examina-
tiolls in January of next
year, the group decided.

Problems which face Grinncll
and other institutions in reference
to drnltecs and volunteers were
discussed ti-cm floor by incul-
ty members.

The final motion, adopted un-
aiiimously by the group, as stated
by Pres, Scmucl N. Stevens from
the chair read:

“All seniors subject to
the draft who have colli-
plated the first semester’s
work, uho pass the (mills
prohen ivcs, and who re-
main ill good standing at
the time of their call may
be given diplomas even
though they have not com-

pleted the 120 hours work

conventionally required for

graduation.”

This ruling was taken only as
a. temporary measure while a com-
mittee on cducstionsl policies
further considers what action
shall be taken, it was declared.

Stevens, in on opening address
to the assembly said that the ad<
ministration of Grinnell intends to
save all of the past achievements
of Grinnell possible during the
wartime strain.

“We may just have to toss out
our anchor and ride the storm,"
Stevens asserted,

Programs may be devised which
will fit in with the realistic period
of wartime America, Stevens de-
elsred,

He pointed out, however, that
there will probably not be regular
military training instituted in
schools where it does not exist at
present.

“We can only guess," Stevens
said, ”Vthlt the government may
require is impossible to fortell."

Courses in nurscs' training for
women and in naval training for
men may be worked out to
the national cause, and toward
holding Grinnell college together
during the war, Stevens sai .
