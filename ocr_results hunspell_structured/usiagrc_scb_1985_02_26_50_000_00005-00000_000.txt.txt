'L‘he Humanities are shaking on some oi

e dust.

‘Do gain a breast position on recent

terature and criticism. members oi the

umanities Divlsion have been taking part
year long seminar entitled “The Post-
tructuralist Reading Group."

1;his semester consultant for the group is
uenter Zoeller. Having studied a year in
aris with several oi the authors or this
ovement, such as Jacques Derrida,
. ables Zoeller to give a sharp insight
'rectly into the movement, he said.

Last semester Zoeller served as an

ssistanl Professor of Philosophy. here at

rinnell. '

institutions, religion, and literature.”

Professor of English, Peter Connelly ex
plained the emergence or Post
structuralism this way:

“The Structuralist enterprise seemed to
be eltective in the study oi linguisties and
appears to have made its way into an
thropology in the work oi Le'vi-Strauss,
and [ruin there into literary study. and at
almost exactly the same time. into
philosophy. ln philosophy. it is manilested
as Postrstructuralism." Connelly said.

The intluence ot Poststructuralism is
expected to be seen mostly in academic
areas.

“It might change the way we teach
literature. The way literature has been
taught in the United States since the titties
has been pretty much the same", said Con-
nelly, He also said. “It's hard to open one
[a literary journal] up without seeing an
article that isn't lniluenced by all this."

The changes caused by this movement
will probably be slow and obscure to many
people, Connelly said. adding “Things
don't change by revolution. but there is a
great deal of inertia in all this.”

The seminar has been held in the past

and has dealt with many topics. “In the
past semester we discussed various intern
pretations oi a short story by Edgar Allen
Poe [The Purloined Letter]. This story has
been interpreted tirst by French psycho-
analyst Jacques Lacon, then by the
philosopher Jacques Derrida and tinally
by an American literary critic, Barbara
Johnson," Zoeller said.

The group is structured so that all par-
ticipants are encouraged to share their
ideas without the guidance ot a particular
leader, However, this semester is
somewhat of an exception. Said Connelly.
”We don't [usually] have a leader,
Guenter right new acts as a leader because
he's taking us‘through some stuff that he
knows and we don’t,”

Presently. the 12 members actively par-
ticipating come from the Departments ol
Classics. English. French. Philosophy,
Sociology. Spanish. and Theater.

“One could say that our goal is to
critically evaluate both the strengths and
weaknesses oi the Poshstructuralist
authors", said Zoeller.
