and earnestness which gives him
a strong hold upon his audience.

With ”What Seek ye?" as a sub-
ject an analysis was made of the

motives of college life. There is

a tendency among many to be
almost too exclusive in their work,
to spend too much time in think-
ing otself and to waste time in
innocent yet \vitltal unproﬁtable

actions, In a review ofsucli char-

acters as John R. Mott, D. L.
Moody and Florence Nightingale
itwas pointed out that at:er all
the thing to bc'sotlght is reality.
There must be rctlity about our
biblestudy, reality in prayer, we
must be real as personal workers
and have areal missionary Spirit.

or sin in the tt'ol‘ltl,m;ln'sablllty to

Christ's power to help all, some
recent achievements among col»

the past year the number of stti
dents engaged in daily systematic
study of the bible has almost
doubled. There has been great
revival in personal work in most
of the institutions. Christian ac»
tivity is no longer conﬁned to a
few countries but is manifest
among students all over tlte world.

An ad.itional opportunity to
hear this speaker will be given to
the young men connected with
the institution this evening at

of the Y. M C. A. will not be held

Murray will lead it. It is the
special wish of the president that
every man who has hcard Mr.
Hurrey come and bring with him
at least one friend.

see the kind of work that is being
regularly done by the ladies.

It was very noticeable that a
different class of work has been
taken up this year. Not so much
attention is given to fancy drills
but rather to good practical ex»
erciscs which are most excellent

The work consisted mostly of
drills, marches, exercises on the

jumps, all at which were perrornr
