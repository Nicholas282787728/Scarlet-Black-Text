Who's Afraid of
The Big, Bad
Eagle!

1 The Dibble eagle—bird of fame7
is once more the mascot of the
oorth-enders.

it is not the same Dibble eagle
which underwent so many trials and
tribulations during the past few
The cast-iron bird
was spirited away by parties un-
known during the spring vacation of
1933, and, according to reports. took
leave of absence on a northbound
freight.

The first bird, in all its ZED-pound
grandeur, was introduced to the
Grinnell campus in 1931 by Larry
Hunt, ex '34, who induced the fowl to
take up its abode on the parapet of
Dibble hall. The emblem remained
there until yanked off that winter
by a wire manipulated, it is said, by
two Gates hall men, but it was rein-
stated by the men of Dibble.

During hell week of 1932, the bird
was droWnef] in Arbor lake, but Dib-
ble freshmen fished it out, and in-
stallation ceremonies again placed
the white creation on the Dibble tow-
cm. A coating of paint, tar and
feathers, applied that year, did not
seem to dampen its spirits, and it
remained aloft until the momentous
event of last spring.

The new and smaller Dibble eagle
is constructed of white glass and is
the “gift” of William Lcachman, '35.
instead of being placed on high, it
will, according to ball members,
make its nest in the Dibble trophy
case.
