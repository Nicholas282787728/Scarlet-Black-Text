and renovation of the ﬁne arts build
ing, we want to promote the arts on

At the Movies this weekend... ,

The English Patient

_ Here it is, folks! Here at this ﬁne
institution, you get what you pay for.
Plead with our beautiful films chair,
Matt Saiia. to bring some quality,
Oscar winning performances to the
Han’is center, and BOOM! There
you have it. The English Patient is
the ﬁrst of a streak of ‘97 Academy
Awards residue to miraculously in—
vade the Grinnell campus this spring
(Never mind, of course, that if these
ﬁlms were broughtin last semester,
they would have been branded as
“artsy" and “obscure"—and why do
we want to waste our time with that?)

Nonetheless. The English Patient
will shock you! It is NOT what you
think it may be! Personally, when I
ﬁrst heard of the ﬁlm. Iwas expectr
ing a black comedy presenting the
age-old paradigm about how all Erit~
ish people belong in a mental insti»
tution. I was anticipating a cast led
by the talented Tim Roth, with per

'haps some cameos by typically
“American" stars to prove that the
popularity of psychotherapy in the

good 01’ USA isjustifled, But I was '

REALLY looking forward to the
soundtrack featuring the Spice Girls
(it's whatIreally really wanted.) Una
fortunately, none of these expecta-
tions were fulﬁlled. In my opinion,
there is only one incentive that you
should need to get your lazy ass up
and go see the film: Ralph. He’s no
Baldwin, but we must admit that he
is one ﬁne specimen of a man. And
he‘ll be at the Harris center this week-

‘ GRIN'N'ELL, Iowa 7 The works
of two artists will be exhibited at
Grinnell College in April.

The ﬁrst is "Recent Paintings" by
Chicago artist John Pittman in the
Hurling Library Print and Drawing
Study Room at Grinnell College,
April 1-25. An opening reception
for Pittman will be held at 4: 15 pm,

Tuesday, April 1, in the Print and
Drawing Study Room.

The second IS photography by
Andy Kropa, a thirdryear student at
Grinnell, April 4728. Kropa, who
spent a semester at the Illinois Instr
tute of Technology in the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest art projects
program, made a pinhole camera.

His photos will be exhibited in the
Burllng Gallery of Burllng Library

At the Forum Gallery, a display
of various photographs by Grinnell
students in the photography craft
workshop can be seen. These stu-
dents have displayed their works
covering a wide range of subycct
matter, and is deﬁnitely worth a look.

and cases ofillegally imported Rhino
horns, known for their aphrodisiastic
abilities. Anyway, I thought I would
tell you a little bit about the movie.
Apparently, in this ﬂick, a couple of
lesbians or bisexuals steal money

. . , from the Mob, and are thus forced to ,

flee, hence “Bound", as in, we
”Bound" from the Mob. Anyway,
since I didn’t see it, I can only make
some vague predictions about the
plot..I bet the lesbians/bisexuals tri—
umph‘ because, in Hollywood, they
are cn vogue. Also, there may or may
not be a morale about how love
knows no “bound"aries.And I would
like to mention, that unless I am
“bound" to a tree or something, you
will see me “bound”ng to the F0-
rum to see this movie. because les-
bians/bisexuals are my favorite
people, and this mOVIe is “bound” to
have plenty of them. '

RS. Oh yeah, if you found Nick
and Wln’s reviews to be less than
informative, and don’t know about
the plots of the other two movies, I
wouldjust like to take the time to ask
you what planet you’ve been on for
the last year and a half.

Collegium Musicum offers up
some Renaissance tunes

Staff Writer '

This Sunday night at 8:00 PM,
I-Ictrick Chapel will be host to the
Collegium Musicum early music en»
semble as they perform “Musrcal
Countcnances.” As director Elizar
beth Hays
said,» they
will explore
“an idea
about re»
giolial idcn.
tities in mur
sic being
recogni z -
able.” They
will prima.
rily delve
into the Me-
dieval and
Renaissance
lnusic from England, France and
Venice. In addition to amuch needed
lesson in regional identity and mu
sic history, the visual effect of the

performance will be enhanced by the

various period instruments and cos
tumes that, with the music, will pro-
vide a full scnsory experience. As
Hays emphasizes the added visual

“all are intrepid when
it comes to exploring
the earlier styles. ”

effects, she explains that, “perform
ing on the instruments in use at the
time is one ofthe main ways ofbring
ing out the essential character of the
music."
The group will also feature a
wide array ofinstruments rarely used
today such as
crumhorns,
p s a l t e r y,
shawm, natu-
ral flutes and
recorders In
addition, four
singers will
c o n tribu te
their talents
. to the pro
gram. A
number of
e n s e m b l e
pieces and a
few solos are planned fora group that
Hays describes as being “a talented
group of students and two faculty
from the Biology department."
While she emphasizes that “all are
intrepid when it comes to exploring
the earlier styles" they succeed in
“coaxing tlie‘ best out ofthcir instru»
ments, and putting the music IDA

gether." Most ofthe people that are
a part of this talented ensemble had
played modern instruments before,
but as Hays describes, “to have a
player comein with prior experience '
on early instruments is almost uni
heard of." She explains that “some
crossovers from modem instruments
to their early counterparts are made
quite easily." in fact, on ofthe play-
ers had no previous musical experi-
ence and is now playing on the re.
corder and Renaissance flute with the
group. Despite the lack ofprevious
experience. the group has had “had
fun putting the music together in re-
hearsal,” “I'm drawn to this music
not Just because of its clarity and
rhythmic vitality, but perhaps be-
cause of the appealing type of col-
laboration it calls for," explains
Hays,

The doors into the history of Re—
naissance and Medieval music will
be open to the public at 8:00 PM
where the Collegium Musicum inr
vites “the audience to enjoy the range
of its colorful aspects," featuring
music from about 1615 back until the
time of the Gregorian chant.
