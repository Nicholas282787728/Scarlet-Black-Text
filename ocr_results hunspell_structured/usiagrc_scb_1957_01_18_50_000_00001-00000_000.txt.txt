League Board Sponsors Open Meeting; LeFevre Gives
Discusses Study Hall Problem, Budget Guest sermon

By Joan Vander Naitld _

Seventy women attended the open meeting held by the
League Board Sunday. Topics open for discussion were
study hall, women’s social budget and'elec‘tion procedures.
The purposes of study hall and some of the problems
concerned with it were explained. Norman W. Ma‘ble,
(buildings and grounds), has promised to take responsibility

for new physical changes con-
cerned. These changes are: a
new ,paint job, a ventilating
fan, flourescent lighting and
long tables with chairs. Possie
bilities of program changes
within the study hall were pre:

sented.

Women now use the study
hall on a. voluntary basis, for
academic warning or proba-
tion and due to campusment
as a punishment for social
misdemeanor. The suggestion
that rules be changed so that
study hall is not an academic
punishment tor a social mis»
demeanor was discussed Al-
ternatives were presented
such as room confinement,
studying in the library or
separate study hall rules for
campusments.

The.women showed an in.
terest in establishing an honor
system for study hall. Several
problems arise trom these ideas.
How would a penalty be im-
posed for violation of the honor
system? Would room' confine»
ment be adequate for quiet hour
violations? Does study ball, as
it is now, help the girl who is
campused andi has liorary work
to do or papers or write, and
is unable to get the material
any other time during the day?

The women’s social budget
has 3359 left this semester. it
was suggested that part of this
money be used to buy books
for the woman student from
Hungary and perhaps the
greater portion of this could
be placed in a trust fund
which would be used to meet
her living expenses while at
Grinncii. .

Also suggested was the need
