istic drama of the European theatre
and of certain brilliant personalities
creating that theatre. The impress
ions 01 the author include observa—
tions made in Dublin, Prague, Buda-
pest, Moscow and many other Euroe
peaii cities.

Creighton Officials Deny Rumors

Omaha, Nebr., Dec. 4: Following
the defeatof the Creighton univc ity

tion but promptly squelched. Wynne’s

tied one and won but two this sea»
son, and the disgpnntled "wolves" are
inevitably dissatisfied. The partisans
of the popular Creighton coach point
out that he was faced with the
toughest schedule ever played by the
Blucjays, and constantly handicapped
by a shortage of reserve material.
The injury plague also descended
hard upon the Blue camp this sea
son, and the Creightoninns were sel-
dom able to muster all the regulars
together for a game.

Another consoling feature of the
Creighton season was that the Omar
bans came within oil ace of cupping
the Missouri Valley Conference
championship by defeating Grinnell
and the oklahoma Aggies, and vcry
nearly upsetting Drake.

“Wynne will stay," was the positive
declaration of Athletic Director A. A,
Schabinger, and Schabinger’s vote of
confidence was echoed by an over~
\vhelming majority of the Bluejay ful»
lowers, who still see in "Gloomy
Chet" the nearest approach to Knute
Rockne in the market. And so, the
isolated wolirwails are drowned out
in a Chorus of “Attahoy, Chet‘s."

The convention was good but there
was really too much of it for pleas—

The afternoon meetings assembled at
one—thirty and wentuutil the Evanston
current failed. For every tardiness a
fine of fitty cents was charged and for
every absence the stipend of three
dollars was extracted. Somehow we
managed to keep out of paying these
lines.

Although we did not bring back
trophies for Grinnell we did receive
some recognition. The Malteaser was
rated as one of very few really good
humor magazines and ”The Red—Hot
Static" was classed as a paper having

So'lnuch for honors. Personally I
came back convinced that Grinnell
“as better than any other college or
university represented incl-e. ! hope
I am not clifluviuistic. The one thing
which impressed me the most from
conversations with the delegates, and
these Chats naturally turned to jourr

Grinhcll publications, Several spoke
highly of the literary excellence of
The Tanager. The Multeaser receivV

census of which can be given in the
naive statement which I heard a
fl’osh make on the train Sunday eve-
ning—or was it Monday morning, “I
like the Malteaser; the jokes are [un-
ny."

The editors of college and univer-
sity papers which were in attendance
were unslinting in their praise of
THE SCARLET AND BLACK and its
apparent monopoly on the cups and
banners awarded by the Iowa. College
Press Association. The majority sup~
posed that we were oppressed by a
board of publications at Grinnell and
were greatly surprised wlienI inform-

A rather spontaneous statement

The wintry days fly by enact:
hibernal nights flit quickly too; the
snowflakes and the hours race, and
lessons and exams accrue. The days
are blowy, brisk, and chill; the wind
is boistrous, strong, and shrill; the
snow sifts through the window sill,
and Christmas looms upon our view,
Fair fir trees soon will grace the
stores, and put [orth incandescent
blooms; fresh holly wreaths will grow
on doors while ivy sprouts about the
rooms. The evergreens the campus
round, their forms with snowy sumite
gnwned, will nod their heads, all
icy-crowned, and blithely wave
suow~feathered plumes. The glib
card shai-ilers now appear with

Christmas cards for us to buy; from

bright objects which intrigue the

pai ‘ all things seem hopeful, good,

and iail‘; the yuletide spirit fills thC
air; the holidays are drawing night.

A few more days of troubled strife;
a fortnight more to strive and strain,
and then two weeks of joyous life,

two weeks without scholastic pain.
Two weeks with nothing to annoy,
two weeks of pcacc and perfect joy,
two peaceful weeks at homeiDb Boy.

The carpet white that strows tlic

trails; the student body will dishand

the snowplain, stretching east and

quest, as youth speeds gladly home to

ﬂHﬂiHEHS’ PLAY

Critic Unable to Choose Any One
Star In “Expressing Willie”
Presented Nov. 24.

PRODUCTION CREW PRAISED

Production of Plays Hampered by
Lack of Facih’ties With
Which To Work.

By Aileen Milligan.

Though ten days have elapsed since
presentation of “Expressing Willie,"
the Dramatic club play has not yet
passed out of campus conversation,
Nor will it soon lose its present prom-
inent position in the memories of
Grinnell play-goers for “Expressing
\Villie" was a performance of well—
l'oundcd, excellence.

Any attempt to judge the outstand~
ing player is futile. The “all-star"
cast included: Virginia Read, a scin-
tillating Dolly Cadwalader, vivacious-
ly expressing herself in a Charleston;
Edward Bonnifield, stirring fellow-
players and audience with the smooth,
low voice and leisurely manners of
the artist Talliafero; Margaret Napier,
playing with perfect sophistication the
role of the selfrcentcred, dissipated
widow, Frances Sylvester; Margaret
Weishaar forcefully commanding the
course of events as Willie's dimlnu<
tive but dominating mother; Brewster
Woodburn maintaining the light hu»
mor of George Cadlvalader by fingerv
ing the furniture and toying with the
serious ideas of his (allow-players:
and Margaret Jean Howell and Ford
Stewart in the leading roles.

Howell Stars

hiis's Howell interpreted the part
with the intense emotional fervor
which it demanded. She had difficulty
in lowering the pitch of her voice in
harmony with Minnie’s sudden attain-
ment of selfrcontrol, but she ultimate-
ly managed the change. Having heard
Margaret Jean Howell perform on
better pianos one could not help re-
gretting that Minnie Whitccmb’s self—
expression was limited by a mediocre
instrument. Even so, her playing was
brilliant—in keeping with the role.

Ford Stewart, as Willie Smith, was
thoroughly in character, supressing
himself until the Climax of the play
and the final opportunity for his de-
termined selfrexpression.

Even the servants performed their
appearances and disappearsnces with
timely trend and suitable hearing.
Alyce Millard was cast as Jean, Henry
Bacon as Reynolds ,and John Conner
as Simpson.

The players were aided by many
production workers in the successful
presentation of "Expressing Willie."
Sara Sherman Pryor, as director, de-‘
scrves distinct commendation for this
production, her first Grinnell play.
Paul Dllrl'ie, who designed the artistic
stage settings, and the large group of
production students who executed his
plans, contributed much to the effec-
tiveness of the play. Ruth Evans had
charge of the proper-ties and direct—
ed the construction of the astonish—
ingly realistic ltalian furniture, our
ers who deserve much credit are Mary
Stevenson, the technical director, Ron-
ald Bean, who drew the Italian frieZE.
Arthur Kisser for lighting, and Flore
ence Geier for costumes.

The stage crew, with Edmund Mor-
rison as stage manager, worked with
the curtain raised and gave the audi-
ence the uruisual pleasure of watch—
ing the rapid scenery shifts betWEEn

The Experimental Theatre orchestra.
entertained the audience wall between
acts, but would make distinct improves
inent by a more careful choice of so
lections to fit the mood of the play
and by more intensive practice. Some
truly fine work should he done by
this orchestra before the end of the
year, because it includes good instrur
mentation and experienced musicians.

The work of producing plays in
Crinnell would be greatly facilitated
by the erection of a college theatre,
as Paul Durrie, Dramatic club presi-
dent, told the audience in his talk be—
tween acts, But the enthusiastic work
or the cast and producing crews dur-
ing long and late does net fine re—
sults under present conditions as was
evidenced in the remarkable produc-
tion of "Expressing Willie" at the
Colonial theatre on Saturday evening,
November 24.
