The $|000 Question - -

The easy thing to do this week would be
to talk about Spring in Grinnell, and How

Lovely the Campus Looks. Unfor unately,
the easy thing isn’t the right thing. Last
Monday night spring didn’t look so enticing
to a lot of Grinnell students, when the tu-
ition increase was announced at housemeet-
ings. The right thing to do this week is to
consider that.

We are in the midst of an inflation. If
you do not realize it now, you soon will.
When you go home in June, compare the
family grocery bill with wllat it was five
years ago. Try to buy sheets, towels, and
pre-war food. A little observation of life off
the campus will disclose what too many of
the students don’t have a chance to see first
hand—that we are a long way from back to
normal,

Most thinking students, however, were
resigned to the fact that an increase was
necessary when they walked into the mass
meeting Tuesday evening. Most students
went to the mass meeting because they
hoped that President Stevens could offer
some solution to a seemingly impossible
.situation. After a lengthy dissertation on
the current economic status of conditions
affecting costs at Grinnell college, two
straws were finally ., offered the student

body: the chance to work at an increased
rate of employment, and the possibility of
scholarship ' increases, Let’s investigate
these for a solution. The administration
takes a beating often enough, but we doubt
that they were responsible for the war and
resulting inflation.

AdIn—-

Last Saturday nctmen Dol'athy, Wilson,
Powell, and Douma won the Grinnell-Coe
tennis matches taking [our out of six. it
must have seemed strange to the men from
Coc that a team which u as able to emerge
victorlous from its first intercollegiate alt-
tempt slllce 194243 had to play on its home
courts under the conditions which existed
that day. There were no referees. Dcclslolls
had to be made by the spectators (all Grin—
nellialls) or agreed upon between the piny-
ers themselves. Grinnell provided no line

~—l\'lllcll are really the women’s courtsi
were in poor condition. There were not
enough balls, and to top things otl’, Grinnell
did not even rate the presence of a coach.
To 2i certain extent these deficiencies can
be rationalized, This is Grinnell's first ac-
tive athletic year for some time. The tennis
schedule had just recently been decided up-
on, leaving little time to equip a team or at,
tend to the courts, Marty O'Conner, tennis
coach, is forced to divide his time between
tennis and track due to the fact that Les
Duke, regular track coach, has not yet r —
turned to Grinnell. Still it does seem as if
sufficient interest is being shown on the
part of the players to warrant more ade-

officials during competition, and there
should be enough interest shown to secure
somewhere a competent person to supervise
playing technique.

Many of,the difficulties will, of course, be
eliminated next year when the athletic de-
partment will be running on a full schedule.
There should be enough money available
next year to adequately equip the team and
provide for the best hard clay courts. A
school which can afford to spend $3,000.00
for a centennial play will be able to arrange
things so that the men’s and women‘s ath~
letic schedules will not conflict for lack of
available facilities. Next year Grinnell will
have a full time tennis coach. A little more
interest shown this year, however, might
serve to encourage the players and give
Grinnell a name to be proud of in intercol-
legiate athletics.
