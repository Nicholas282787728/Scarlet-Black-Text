While saying that Iowans
demonstrated the ability to vote
their own minds, McLean noted
that Republicans retained a ma-
Jority in the us. Senate and gain-
ed 12 more seats in the House. The
gain made in Congress, coupled
with Reagan‘s re-election sends
the clear message abroad that
Amerlca has taken a definite turn
toward the right. McLean said,

McLean said he thinks that the
Soviets have been waiting to see
who would win the election and
that non, they would be iiilhng to
sit down to serious arms negotias
trons resulting in a truly beneficial
arms agreement

“1 think the Reagan landslide
reflects the country's movement
to the right." Jim Gillespie said,
Tuesday night. as he and others
watched the results ln Loose
Lounge at a Political Science
department getstogether,

"One should watch the turn to
the right though it is not a clear res
alignment.‘ Gillespie Said.

P‘inall). lan McLean said
"When you tReagant come in
with 54 percent ot the popular
vote, it it's not a mandate tor the
tuture, it's at least a resounding
approval at iihat we'vc done over
the past four years."

McLean added that he would
like to thank all the Young
Republicans who donated time
and energy to the campaign.

conceed that liberalism within the
political arenas might be eroded.

Grey expects that Reagan will
continue to pursue the policy
course which he has tolloweu
through hi iirst term inoiiicc but
Grey qualified this view by stating
that however disinclined he is to
do so. President Reagan itill have
to cut military spending in order
to reduce the delicit and that
Walter Mondale has been right;
President Reagan ii-ill have to
raisc taxes. And. Grey predicted
that this tax package.nould be
quite regressive to the detriment
of this 'ountl'y s pool-

Reagan’s landslide victory should not Overly impress '
Congress, House counsel (Grinnellian) says

by lioherl Quasliie

The United States Congress will
not be signiﬁcantly impressed
that Ronald Reagan won with a
landslide. Bill Mohrman, counsel
to the House Foreign Affairs Coms
mittee and Grinnell graduate.
said Wednesday as he spoke to a
town and college audience about
the changes one might expect
given the outcome oi Tuesday's
election.

Mohrman had been on Campus
most of the week speaking to
classes alid givmg open lectures
as a guest or the Political Science
department and the Rosentield
Chair

“In 1930 the voters wanted a
change in government and the
members of Congress. tor the ma
jority felt that the voters wanted
them to work along with Ronald
Reagan.” Mohrman said. Believ-
ing that they had a clear mandate
trom the people, many members
voted in opposition to their own
views. he added.

A big question in tort, Mohrman
said. was whether this election
would be based on personality or-
politics. Most voters, he argued.
voted tor Ronald Reagan as a per»
son ralher than for Iiis policies
However. Reagan's personality

. Mohrman

was not strong enough to carry
other members oi the Republican
party into ottice. he said

they campaigned on constituent
service rather than natiolial
issues. He added that mid-term

Mohrman said he had the im-
pression that Helms may not even -
take the position because he would
have to leave his chairmanship on -
the Senate Agriculture Comm

that this might catalyze pressure -
