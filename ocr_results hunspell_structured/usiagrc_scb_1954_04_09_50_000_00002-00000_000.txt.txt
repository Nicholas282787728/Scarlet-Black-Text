! Maybe ‘Spring Week’?

Spring Day is, we suppose, still a few weeks off. But

before final plans for the annual holiday are set, it would
be a good idea if the day’s program were thoroughly ex-
amined.

The problem is ticklish: most students probably would
prefer having the day come as a surprise, as it did two
years ago, and would also want the extra late hours for
{voznem granted last year, when the surprise element was
OS .

No one knows just what the majority of students'

wantﬁa Spring Day beginning at 8:30 am. and lasting
until hours (only slightly extended), or a holiday begin-
ning the night before with hours extended further (last
year 7 1 am), 01' perhaps a compromise could be ef-
fected, offering both later hours on that one night, and
the element of surprise.

Maybe it would be acceptable, and preferable, to open
Spring Day later in the morning of the day itself, and hav-
ing it continue through noon of the following day. A pro-
gram could conceivably be Worked out for that schedule.

Perhaps that would work; perhaps not. But we hope
on examination of the program will be made~and What-
evedrftxhe result, We’re looking forward to the day of rest—

Express Opinions on Cui Rule

by Nancy Oates

President Samuel N. Stevens and Dean of Women Evelyn
Gardner expressed satisfaction with the results of the present cut
system in an interview with on Site reporter recently.

Dean Gardner said, “The present system is effective in that
the cxccssivc cutting which took placewunder the old system has
stopped, and attendance has improved." .

(The present system was set up by students three years ago.
Prior to that time the number of cuts allotted
semester was not specified.)

Dean Gardner stated, “Sixty ,
percent of the students don’t
need a cut rule. 1 would esti-
mate that only fifteen percent
or the students would have,
their grades affected by the

 

deal of freedom.

“Any cut system such as l
this is for a minority. My
personal preference is for a l
less precise system, however i
it could not he ciiccted for
some time." t
President stcvcns said of the
present cut rule, ”Some such
device is essential and this one
is good. We cannot ignore the
foot that this is an institution,
and the rules must be for the
group?“ Individual freedom and
group ooncicusness are not in-
compatible. students are not
sent to college to be given un-.

“In order to have freedom
you must be willing to take
responsibility for the conse-
quences. students and their
parents are frequently un—
willing to do this. There are
time and achievement factors
in winning freedom You do
not win freedom

President stcvens stated that
he thought that “nothing valuc
would come out of the
present son survey since it as-
sumed that a cut system such
as the present one might prove

MOURNERS

by Ed Lain;

An important decision that
will influence the whole
course of Student government
at Grinnell may be made in
the next few days.

The problem is this: The studs
ent organizations committee
(which consists of the Dean of
Men, the Dean of Women, three
faculty members, n treasurers
office representative. and four
students, has been discussing and
making suggestions about the
proposed constitutional docu-l
ment. I

This committee is empowered
to bring such a document—with
or without its blessingabefore
the faculty for its appmval.

It will finally need several
stamps of approval, but the
first hurdles alre the President
and the student organizations
committee. so that a finished
and approved document may be
brought before the faculty and
then the students,

The fact is that the student
organizations committee has
found dnany areas of tho docu—
ment that need reworking.
Mnny of its objections are in-
tended to spell out and clarifyl
the details; some other objecA
tions may actually be [more
basic.

but the crux of the matter is
that the student organizations
committcc has announced that
the process is too long to fin-
ish so that fin-u approval can
come this school year. It has
token much time already, per-
blips necessarily so. However,
this is the crucial declaration:

I They have offered an alternao
‘tive: install the judicial hnanch
at the new constitulﬁon and set
up the executive council (legis-
lative branch) on an orientation,
semirofficial basis. The result
would be‘ a mixed government of
the students by the 01d structure
with a few modifications on im:
portant areas. This would be
done soon, perhops before year’s
end.

Also hcforc year's end gen-
eral grants of powe!‘ would
In: made by the administration
and faculty; these grants of
power would ho intended to
grant the basic premise or the
now constitution—studcnt gov-
mnlent in student hands.
Final details of the actual con-
stitution would be left until
next you when they would
l he “worked out." The rest of
the new setup would go into
effect at stated times next
vcan

Tho validity of such an alter
native depends on two assump-
tions. 1. That the student organ-
izations committee could not
speed up the work on the docu-
mcnt so that it could be put
into effect in its cnthctye
without blank spots—dust as
soon. 2. That the final wording;
of the details in the blank
spot will not in effect defeat
the purpose and spirit of c
document that had been “ap-
proved” by all concerned.

There is something to be said
for that alternative: if it took
less time to put into effect, it

might keep the whole plan
from being detailed to death

But the risk is Worth it, The

it will die out in the open,

To the editor: l

We would be the last to sayl
that frccdom of the press,
should be deemed at Gi-innoll;
however, with that freedom
should go a certain amount of
discretion. We feel the lack of
personal rcspcct for individuals,
as evidenced by a recent edi-l
torial in this paper, warrants!
attention. The supposed pui-pose‘
of this editorial was oversha-
dowed by the poor taste dlsplay-
ed in its printing. Certain is-
sucs are aided by publicity
while others arouse only emo-
tlonal reactions, often undeslrs
able.

The whole question of racial'

lem which certainly should cons
earn the students at GrinnellH

one of n more private nature.
publicizing the issue makes it
impossible for the continued,
quiet, sensible. and intelligent
handling of the situation. Noth-
ing was gained by the editorial
except notoriety and undue err»
barrassment for all concerned,
A discreet handling of the prob
lem was desirable on all sides;
yet this course of action be-
Came impossible. Unfortunately
the editorial has already been
printed and the damage has been
done, In the future, we would
like to recommend that before
editorlals Concerning personal
relationships within the college
are printed, the aims be thought
through and the repercussions
be considered.
