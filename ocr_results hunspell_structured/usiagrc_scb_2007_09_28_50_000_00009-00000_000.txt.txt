The JRC gets criticized a lotiwe’re as guilty as airy group
in complaining, But irwe step orrour soapboxes, we admit that
the space does arrord students many advantages, from more se-
lections in the drnrng hall to more study space. In the back or
the second floor, though, lies a section of strident life few on
campus see.Thcsc are the multicultural suites.

One suite currently stands unused.The Stonewall Resource
center, a conﬁdential and site space that serves the campus'
LGBTQand allied community, moved out ofits allotted space
in the JRC, preferring a former smoking lounge rn Youuker Fit
to its brand new, air-conditioned ofﬁce, Most LGBT wroups
on campus are too brg to meet in the JRC orace, In their new
surroundings, there's more than errorrgh space and the prrvacy
to make the community comfortable,

Yet the SRC has asked to maintain a space in the JRC, even
after trying to give the ofﬁce back. It seems the admrnrstratrou
wants to keep mulrreulturalrsm on it: designated hallway.

Put simplv each diversity group, ranging from SOL to the
SRC to Chalutzirn, has its own small office and lounge. Each
groups room can comfortably hold 10 to 12 people and features
wall-to-wall windows looking out on the hallway— , rather,
the hallway looks in.

The suites are the results ofplnns that date back 10 years,
when the JRC was only a blueprint And at the tune. the suites
probably reﬂected the needs of multicultural groups, who had
no physical space to call their own, But times have changed.
While changing the builrlirrg itselr maybe dirrrcult, admlnls’r
tratois need to be ﬂexible wrtli the changing needs of campus
groups.

These suites are too small for some meetings, and the hall-
way does little to engender dialogue between the various groups
to be found on the wing. Administrative gniidelincs governing
use otrhs hall are unnecessarily rigid: studentrmnde signs and
posters are prohibited on the hallway,

Most importantly, the suites are in the back orthe building,
uncharted territory for most students. In the past, these groups
may have wanted privacy and space for administrative needs,
Many now want larger spaces and a more accessible locatron.

The multicultural suites provide valuable space for many
smaller groups. But groups vary in membership and purpose—
their needs cannot be viewed as “one size fits all." Administra-
tive regulations on the multicultural suites should work with
multicultural groups to help them meet their needs in terms of
space and accessibility. That may mean letting groups put up
posters or allowing them to relocate to a more fitting space.

Multicultural groups tar-sly if ever have consistent needs
over time. If the SRC does not need a second office, Student
Affairs should accept the keys and let them move. Multicultur
alism may not fit on a small hallway in the back ofthe JRC.

Let’s pretend you didn’t hear that

Do you ever feel like your entire life is comprised ormaking
a fool otyoursrlo Good.

Maybe it's because I’m immune to embn-rassmcnt, brrt I
love awkward moments I love watching an audience become
palpablv uncomfortable wiren I tell one or my moments. I
speak or the legitimately lrorri
moments that come out ofpure, sot
ber, human awkwardness.

There's the average embarrass
uig stutf that everybody does: mak-
ing a joke and having it received
wrtli a pity laugh, spilling the soup
howls in the dining hall or grabbing
a friend's butt only to ﬁnd out that
us not your friend brrt an RLC (true story),Things like this
make me believe in the power ofcmbarrassment to see the true
side otsomeone I'll even poke holes in my
own H&M, skinnyjeaned, puffyrsleevetl
disgniise to prove it. Remember, this is for
your ears only.

one Wednesday I came back to my
room after lunch. My roommate was in
class, so I strode in and shut the door. 1 un-
loaded my books, checked Faccbook, ﬁxed
my hair in the mirror and then unlcashcd a
tremendous rattlrI'm going to tell my own
embarrassing story, I'm not going to go easy on myself. It was
a satishying fart, one that permeates dorm room walls and lasts
significantly longer than you expect. Feeling ielieved I let out a
little sigh and went to biush my teeth.When I came back I lay
on my bed (or a while reading Suddenly 1 saw the sheets on my
roommate’s bed rustling. l looked over and noticed a girl] have

never seen before reading under her covers

on hey, I sard trying to keep my voice steady and normal
wirile at the same time mentally reviewrng everything Id done
since I walked mro my room

“Sorry," she apologized, “your roommate said I could read

in hele."Thon adding awinvardly, “I
drdn’t even hear you come in. Iwas
sleeping."

We then sat in silence while
she read in bed and I checked my
etmail, both or us pretending that
she hadn't heard me fart and that I
believed that she was asleep when it
happened.

It would have been nice if it ended there. Brit one of my
friends to whom I recounted the story liked it so much that

once in a big group orpeople, she retold lt,
unaware that the girl who had been rn my
room that day was also in the audience. I
avoided eye contact and we’ve never spoken
about it.

Little moments like these are a staple of
the Grinnell student‘s lifestyle. Maybe it‘s
because on this campus we are rarely alone,
so misadventures are perpetually document-
ed in the oral tradition ofgossip, or because
it is hard to come across someone who we don't know or ha\'en't
heard of. Whatever the renson,we’ve all felt at some point that
we couldn't possibly get any more ridiculous. And then we do,
Embarrassing moments might not be something you look for
ward to, but even when they make you cringe years later, these
are the scraps ofourselves that we should sometimes reveal.
