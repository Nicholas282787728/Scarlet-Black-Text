Women’s basketball in Hong Kong '“
keeps Crinnell student on her toes

by Renae Reese

Once I was told the only way I’d
ever start picking up Cantonese
would be to truly listen and to quit
tuning it out.

The only thing I've picked up
from listening to my Cantonese-
speaking basketball coach is the
habit of picking the loose rubber off
of my sneakers to pass the time
until She finishes speaking. For
this reason I feel totally
unqualified to write this article on
women‘s basketball in Hong Kong.
Another reason I hestltate to claim
authority is that for anything that
can be said about Hong Kong, the
direct opposite could be Stated with
perhaps just as much truth.

I JOINED THE Chinesee
University basketball team
because of my lowabred love for
the game and because I want to
meet the girls, Also, practice is
held outside and I figured knowing
how to swat flies and shoot layrups
at the Same time is a Skill I'm sure
to need sometime later in life. I
was prepared for the Cantonese
(I’ve learned to live with that
friendly hum), practice, _and even
anxious for the variation in rules.

But I wasn‘t expecting the warm
welcome I received from the team.
I guess they thought they had
discoved a secret weapon, namely
a female over five feet two inches.

THE FIRST NIGHT I was asked
at least a dozen times just how tall
I was and twice that many times if
any of the other American girls
would like to join the team. Once I
missed practice and the com-
motion was so great I thought the

l neikt" "I'sa‘w the coach she was
going to string me up by my
thumbs and beat me with a
bamboo pole. ,

Actually, she never criticizes
me, not because I don’t need it, but
because of the language barrier.
The other team members make up
for it though. The never fail to
censure my every move. At first it
was hard to accept such
harassment from supposed equals,
but then I perceived that they tear
each other apart as well and was
relieved to find that I wasn’t the

sole butt of their criticism y
THERE ARE STILL definite Sex

roles in Hong Kong and the girls
that defy these roles in order to
play basketball take the game very
seriously. As I entered the gym
before our first game the straight
[aces and tense bodies gave me the
warning that this was going to be
no picnic for anybody.

My own feeling was em»
barrassment; it was my first time
to don my custom-made passion
purple panties lthe uniforms are
incredibly skimpy and purple, of
all colors) It was obvious which
one oi us wasn't the china doll

every jump ball.

IN THAT FIRST bout we beat
the Shatin Recreation Club, 31-25,
*The relatively low score doesn’t

other players, most of whom can
boast :emarkable accuracy which
is out' adowed only by their speed

an advantage because of my

‘lair trial. I found it hard not to
succumb to aggression in that
game oi unsuppressed physical
contact. Everytime I lifted my
arms to catch a pass there would
be a girl or two clinging to each
limb.

The minor deviations from US,
rules have caused me a few em~-
barrasing scenes, but I think the
team accepts my blunders as
further evidence of my unalterable
enigmarhood. More than once I
have taken a flying leap into the
lane to swoop down a rebound after
the second free throw only to look
around and see that now one else
has flinched from their positions

 

 

 

 

JUNG DYE!" (the rather poor
romanticism is my own). Literally
translated it means one, tWO, th-
re'e, middle big. The “middle big”
is the abbreviated form of “Jung
‘men dye hok" which means middle
language, big learn:
Chinese University. But who wants
a lesson in Chinese from the Sports
page anyway? Those were the last
words I understood.

THE GAME. CONSISTING of
two 20 minute halves, was Come
pleted with an hour as the referee
rarely blew his whistle. Most fouls
were overlooked endanytime two
players tied up the ball a
wrusteling match, rather than a
jump ball decided who would gain
central, Despite the frequent
physical clashes I never saw a
display of emotion throughout the

, game. These girls demonstrated

phenomenal self-discipline, What
U S. coaches wouldn'tgive for such
constration and dedication. I am
humbled

We improvcd our record to 2-0
lhis week after defeating Hong
Kong Polytechnique 31711. _It was
“the intellectuals against the
pragmatics" as Joe Poon. (lhe
men‘s coach) said when he was
convincing us that only superior
psychology would win us the game

that in Hong Kong most violations

basketball and not just serving as
an inscrutable giant to lluster the
