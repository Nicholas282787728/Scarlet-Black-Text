oin- Coach.

For a number of years the nltlm
ni, students and faculty of Grin
nell have had a feeling that it
would be best [or us to try a sys
tem of graduate coaching instead
ot tolloivinp the older plan wrth
us ot importing some tauroris cash
ern player to instruct our team in
the principles ot tootball. We
have been very foitunate in secur-
ing coaches from eastern colleges
in past yeais, Every man has
been a gentleman and each one
has brought us something of value
But under the old system it is
practically impossible to work up
a distinctly Giinnell system or
play. We must change as the
eastern colleges change and ex-
periment as they experiment.

This yeai the graduate system
will be tried, and Clint E, Harris,
’96, has been chosen head
'eoach. Mr. Haiiis needs no in—

as

trotluction to many of the alumni
and students. His reputation as
a clean, haid and conscientious
player is known to all. Mr, Barr
ris began his football career iii the
Gi‘innell high school in the fall oi
'oi. He entered Giinnell College
the next fall but was unable to
play on account of his work. In
the fall of ’93 he played end and
tackle on the scrub alternating
between these two positions and
in '94 played substitute tackle to
the 'rar ity. Tins was Bergen's
ﬁrst year or coaching here and as
Mr. Betgen payed almost as much
attention to the scrub as to the
’varsity, those who played on the
second team were well prepared
to ﬁll up the vacant positions lett
by those who giaduatcd, Mr.
Harris was one or those who pros
ﬁted by his experience and se-
cured onc of the muclircovetetl
positions. ln'osheplayedtaeltle
until after the Madison game when

 

he was moved in to guard, which

'position he holtl the l‘ell‘tall‘ltlc‘l of

the season. Last tall he pla)cd

The Snyford Meetings.

The Saytord meetings have
been the theme of conversation
this week. Coming at the invrta-
tion of the Young Men's Christian
Association of the college, Mr.
Sayford arrived Saturday evens
ing and was greeted with a good
audience in the Chapel at 7:30.
In this opening meeting he intro-
duced himself and his missmn in
a unique way, saying that he was
not a minister, a Y. M, C, A. see
retary, or a revivalist in the ordi-
nary scnse at that tcrm, but had
simply come to pass on a message
that had been entrusted to him.
He told in a very interesting way
of his acquaintance with a group
of Amherst students ten years
ago, how he was permitted to lead
several at these young nten to a
deﬁnite acceptance of Jesus Christ
as a personal Saviour and how
they urged him to go out and “tell
the fellows ili other colleges how
to be ﬁrstrelass Christians.”

The difﬁculties melted awayﬁ
the giants and the walled cities
were not round as anticipated;
and tor ten years Mr. Saytord has
gone tip and down this land, visit-
ing all the larger institutions of
highei education, having worked
in nearly every state university in
America, A small syndicate of
casteln business men support Mr.
Snylord in this work and pay all
the expenses of his travels, Four
of the Iowa institutions are visited
this year: The State Normal
School. Cornell College, Iowa Col-
legc and The State Univctsityi

The meetings Saturday evening,
Sunday .atternoon, Monday and
Tuesday evenings and tonight
were announced for all students,
both men and women. In these

lite and character, emphasizing
the fact that the great need of the
church ot God is for quality rather
than quantity, "tor men and wom-
cn who can be weighed and not
simply counted,” His addresses
are brret and pointed and he hits
little of the method and less of
the highrpresstll'e emotion which
so commonly characterizes evan-
gelistic meetings.

Yesterday alter-noon ivlr. Say-
tord spoke to men and the Chapel
was nearly run when the doors
were closed at 3:05 o'cloclt. He
spoke with rare power for nearly
an hotir, givrng facts out of a rich
experience among students, hav-
ing hatl opportunities unequaled
by any living mall forobserving
student lire. Clearly outlining
the things that prevent the devel-
opment of sterling character, he
called on the men to covenant by
the help of God to live pure, man-
ly lives. It was an hour never to
be forgotten by those present.
This etternoon a special address
to the young women at 4:15 com-
mands the attention of nearly
every young woman in college.

The meeting to-night at 6:40
closes the brief series, though Mr
Saylotd has consented to give to
inorrow to personal interviews at
the Hotel Mack. He met a great
many singly and in groups and
has been very helpful to those in
leﬁculty. The work has had the
heartiest sympathy and co-opera~
tion of the faculty and the results
will be abiding.

The Senior Club.

The girls of the senior class met
last Ftiday averting, and, after at-
tending in a body ihe reception
held at the Baptist church, met at
the room of Miss Sarah Nollen, to
discuss plans tor the organization
of a senior club. It was decided
that the club meet weekly. on
Saturday night, to read and dis-

cuss curient literature. The pri-
mal'y objectot the organization is
not the study of literature, hows
ever, but that the members may
become better acquainted with
each othei during this their last
year in college, and by meeting
informally in this way they hope
to unite pleasure with proﬁt. A
meeting has been arranged for on
the coining Saturday evening,
when it is expected that ﬁnal ar-
rangements Will be completed.
