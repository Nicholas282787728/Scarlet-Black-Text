My Dear Mr. Bennett:

This is the answer to your request
for d letter tron: Cambridge and liars
vard. A thousand Harvard students
in khaki are marching by with their
own splendid band at their head. They
carry the French tri-color along with
the stars and stripes. for they are
going to the South station to wel-
come the French oilieers who have
been assigned to the Harvard contin-
gent. All along respectable, censor»
vative Brattle Street, carefully kept
lawns that reﬂect the pains of hair a
century are being turned into potato
patches. AL Dr. Crothel's’ church

nieet twice a week to make surgical
dressings for the French hospitals.
They have been doing this since the
beginning of the we Mrs. Smiley
is one of the number—and we have
our own little surgical dressings es-
[ahlisbemtnt here at 45 Garﬁeld Street.
When we ﬁrst come we heard much

’tslk about the lethargic, indiiteren‘t
middle-west; but since en stincnt has ,
begun and Illinois is furnishing more
men than all New England, and eveni
Oklahoma. City is sending as many
men into the U. S. navy as the great,
city of Boston, we hear nothing more .
about the lethargy and lune-warm-
ness of the middle-west.

My own Work at Harvard and Rad-

parisons were not odious I might In-
stitute various comparisons between
the students of the East and West
Perhaps it is snﬁicient to say that I
shall be quite content to return to
my western classes. ,

I spend about four hours a day at
my own work in the splendid Wid-
ener Library. It is a veritable E , llm
for scholars in all ﬁelds. At the r ‘k

. of seeming a Philistine, let me in-
dulge in a few ﬁgures. The building
cost $4,000,0D0; the janitor service for
a year costs $3,000; my friend Protein ‘

.sor Pease has calculated that the
shelving for books it’ stretched in a
straight line would reach twenty,
miles; the books it contains 'elative
to my own ﬁeld of teaching are

greater in number than our whole ,

Minneapolis Orchestra Plnys.
Monday alter-noon the Minneapolis,
5 mphonr Orchestra appeared in its-
fn-st concert. The feature of this pro- I
gram was the playing at the “Symphe

ony in D Minor" as composed by Prof. r ,

E. B. Selieve of the local school oil
music faculty. Probably the favorite
on the program was the suite in A
minor, op, 42 by MacDowell. There
were four parts to this and each was
greatly applauded, John Cooper as
central“) , mist and Richard Czc
wonky as
of the concert. The final program of
the Festival Was rendered Monday

, night. It was probably the best or
the two given by the orchestra. Specs
ial attention is due the Rnumftnidn
Rhapsody by Eucsco in which on uni
usual number of themes had been Wov-
ell together by the composer. till of
them genuine Roumaninn air Cor-
nelius Van vlict was the olnist of
the evcning and he played three well
selecterl ’collo numbers, the last two
or which were played to harp accomp-
ztniment as enoercs.
