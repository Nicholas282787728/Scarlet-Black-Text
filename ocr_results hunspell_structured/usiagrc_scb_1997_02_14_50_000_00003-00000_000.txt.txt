Sex, incest, and microscopic organisms:

Grinnell College dating dilemmas

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

Beads of sweat start dripping down
their heads, paralyzing their fright.
ened eyes. Men, Women, Dating. Re.
lationships. Independence. Pure
Love. Dirty Love, When a wide are
ray of people were asked for their
views on the subject of dating at
Grinnell. most chose to mask their
answers in anonymity.

“What do I think! What do I think!
I think I can’t get a date!" responded
an under sexed, testosterone lacking
pool player. Other answers ranged
from indignant and depressed to
happy and content. in general, the
level of seriousness and intelligence
with which Grinnell students con-
sider both dating and food is exem-
pliﬁed by the student remark, “Dat»
ing is like a bagel. You‘ve got to chew
it up and spit it back out again.”This
reporter has yet
to see someone
spit a bagel back
out.

Perhaps the
most troubling
area for people
was defining
what dating actue
aily is. Sophoe
more Mike
Schenkleberg
bravely set forth
his theory of
Grinnell dating.
“You know when
someone's idea
ofa date is going
to Harris, danc-
ing, getting
drunk and hook-
ing up with the
first person you
stumble into that
something is wrong."

Most people did seem to agree that
the traditional idea of a candlelight
dinner; with the aroma of freshly
picked ﬂowers and classical music
playing in the background just does
not happen at Grinnell very often.
“Dating here (Breath) isn‘t consid-
ered cool (Breath), you’vejust got
to (Breath) do things casually," re—

wrong.”

”You know when
someone ’s idea of
a date is going to
Harris, dancing,
getting drunk and
hooking up with
the ﬁrst person
you stumble into
that something is

sponded a frothing, sweating first
year monster.

For a more academic deﬁnition of
dating, one can refer to student Chris
Bidler who put forth his own theory
on the problems with dating on cam-
pus, “In order to understand relation»
ships at Grinnell, you need to under
stand a very basic picture of how
populations of animals respond to
dire environmental stresses,” Bidler
elaborated, “For example, ifyou have
a nice, average population of bacte-
ria living in a petri dish, and then you
pump the temperature in the dish up
to a boiling point, most ofihe bacter
ria will die," He argucs‘that inside
this “little pressure cooker" of
Grinnell College, the stress creates a
dating scheme, deformed in compari-
son to outside the bubble of the col-
lege.

In keeping with the theme of com-
paring the college to microscopic or-
ganisms (i.e. bacteria), one person
mentioned the
construction of

n “amoeba of
love”, This is
apparently a
mapping of the
connections be-
tween people
according to the
different rela-
tionships they
have had on the
Grinnell came
pus. “There‘s
got to be serious
incest by the
fourth year. Ev-
erybody knows
everyone else,"
the student said.
One sophomore
described how,
in the house of
_ thirteen in
which he was planning to live, this
year almost everybody had hooked
up with someone else in the house.

Most students seemed to indicate
that dating would be more posstble
if Grinnellians did not already have
such hectic lives. “It saps a lot ofyour
energy, and you don't have enough
time for work and friends,” com»
mented one prioritizmg woman,

 

 

 

 

Ultimately, one returns to the ques
tion of the nature of dating at
Grinnell. Every time dating was
mentioned, the talk seemed to end up
revolving around sex One student
said, “I hear from everyone that they
think the campus is asexual." How-
ever, in this reporter’s investigation,
the overwhelming number ofpeoplc
seemed to think that, in fact, the
Grinnell campus is obsessed with the
idea of sex.

One respondent displayed his be-
lief that it large amount ofcasual sex
occurs at Grinnell, remarking, “Ifany
girls got pregnant on campus, you‘d
need DNA testing to find out who
the father was As harsh as this states
ment was, ultimately, the amount of
casual sex on campus appears to dif»
fer from location to location and
therefore is very difﬁcult to gauge.

Out of this cloud of confused im-
ages of sex, incest and microscopic
organisms, there are still people who
appear to be dating. “You sort of can
make of it what you want of it," ex-
plained yet another anonymous stu-
dent, in reference to dating. There
were both negative and positive re-
sponses to the reality of dating.
Amelia Lobo described how couples
“see each other so much that there is
no mystery," She added, “Mystery is
often part of the reason why people

become attracted in the first place."

While Lobo took unveiling the mys—
tery as a positive move, another stu-
dent blasphemously described how,
when dating at Grinnell, people had
to see each other “every f@#*ilig
day; it’s f#@ling terrible."

The antithetical attitude to that of
most of those interviewed was ex-
pressed by student Graham Gclling.
who is currently in acomfortable re-
lationship. As he beamed in his hap-
piness, he described the positive feel-
ings dating and falling in love can

create. He spoke of the joy of “hav- .

lng someone who cares for you and
who you care for."

In contrast to this beautiful expres
sion of contentedness came a state
meiit from another student who could
not seem to enjoy dating, “There is
only a handful of attractive people
on campus and then everyone else,"
the anonymous student commented.

Ultimately these inquiries provide
no answers, but hopefully'will help
that couple having sex on the heav-
enly loft in Herrick Chapel, and those
partaking in what has been referred
to as_“the second most common form
ofdating,"masturbation,understapd
that there is only one truth where
dating at Grinnell is concerned 7
confusion,

Dating at Grinnell: it can happen to you

One Grinnell couple’s success Story

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Features Editor

Unsubstantiated rumor has been
known to circulate around campus
that one third of Grinnell students
eventually marry other Grinnell stu-
dents. Whether or not this statement
. is truth. mostGrinnell students know
there must be some stable, commit-
ted relationships among a close-knit
community of 1,300. One such
couple. juniors Laura Southworth
and Phil Bloch,
agreed to share
their positive
Grinnell dating
experience with
this often lover
deprived cam.
pus.

Bloch and
S o u l h w o r l h
came to Grinnell
with differing ex—
pectations of the
dating scene,
Southworth had
had a four year
relationship pres
Vlous to entering
college, and the
possibility that
dating atGrirlnell
would be any different than dating
in the real world had not yet occurred
to her. Bloch, on the other hand, said
that he did not expect to enter into a
serious relationship in college,

The copple met in Norris, where
both were living, during the fall of
their freshman year. Within several

“A week of dating
here is like a
month of dating
elsewhere, be- ,
cause you see the
person all the
time, and you
probably have the

same friends.”
7 Phil Bloch '98

weeks of meeting, Bloch and
Southworth were dating. Bloch cited
this tendency of Grinnell relation-
ships to move quickly as a common
source of difficulty in dating, “It’s
important not to let commitment hap-
pen too fast," he commented, “be-
cause that puts a lot of stress on the
relationship and on you,"

When asked to compare dating out-
side of Grinnell to dating at the col-
lege, Southworth and Bloch agreed
thatmalntainlng relationships here is
the more strenu—
ous Situation. “A
week of dating
here is like a
month ofdating
elsewhere,"
Bloch come
merited, “be
cause you see
the person all
the lime, and
you probably
have the same
friends. You can
start to feel like
you have no
time for your-
self"

“Real dating
requires actu-
ally going out
on dates," Southworth added, “which
is difficult to do here." The students
said that tlicy had been making an
effort to spend time together doing
things that could be termed dates, but
that their respective extracurricular
activities had made it hard to ﬁnd
time Grinnell itself, they said, also

ironically, not to

“That‘s what's most important to

Notes From Abroad

BY DAVID REED
Guest Columnist

Hello from the University of St,
Andrews in St. Andrews, Scotland.
For those of you unfamiliar with its
location, it is located on the eastern
Coast of Scotland, slightly above the
Firth of Forth. It is about one and a
half hours north of Edinburgh. St.
Andrews is a gorgeous small town
that is a bit bigger than Grinnell. 1
am studying in the Modern and Scots
iish History Department. The title of
“modern history" is somewhat miss
leading for Americans, i asked one
woman about what type of history
she studied and she rcplicd. “the 15th
and 16th Centuries." While I would
not call that period “modern", it does
prove a very obvious point, European
civilization is very old. This may
SCCIIl like it stupid statement to make,
but the sheer history of Europe does
not really hit you until you tire there.

I stayed In Edinburgh for two days
before going to St. Andrews. Right
ill the middle ofloivni on a large hill,
sits ti big castle ltmntle Iortili illlcre
cslllig sight. Up close Edinburgh
Castle was illuncnse and ‘thCeillSpil'e
ing. I spent five hours touring the
place with a machine and heads
phones that gave me the castlc's his
tory. I could have spent a lot more
timc litsidc the castle was one ofthe
oldest buildings in Scotland, ti chapel
built by Queen Margaret ol'Scotlaiid
(later St. Margaret) iii the 1100's.
Sccing something that old is pretty
cool.

Even ll small town like St. Andlews
is full of history. At one time, it was
the center of Catholicism iii Scots

land. Remains of a huge cathedral
from thc early 1300‘s jut up into the
skyline ofthe town. St. Andrews even
has its own small castle whose sur-
viving incarnation dates from the
1500‘s. The College of St. Andrews
itselfis the third oldest

in the UK, founded in 1411. I can
walk around town and a feel of ven-
erable age permeates the place. Even
ifthe buildings themselves aren't old,
the aura still remains. Other Ameri-
cans I've spoken to have had the
same impression themselves.

Stile British seem aware of the aura
of age in Scotland and the relative
youth of the United States (a point
that they are never tired of making).
A man had asked me if the Ameri-
cans had ”recently” done something
or other. When i asked him what he
meant by recently, he said that he was
speaking of the 1930’s or 40‘s. My
kneejerk reaction towards the word
"icccnt" was the 1980‘s at most. It
makes for an interesting difference
in cultural perception.

.,Wlii1c contemplating history and
perceptions of history may seem bore
ing to some, for a history buff like
me, it’s fascinating. Scotland, with
all its history. is a great place. Hav.
liig only been here for one and a half
weeks, I have only begun to scratch
the surface of the events, culture, and
people of the country. In future col~
umiis, I hope to share more experi-
ences that help to differentiate the
two cultures and pass along some of
my adventures in the process, If any
one has any questions or comments
for rue, my e-rnail address here at St.
Andrews is (drS@st-andrewsiac.uk).
Until the next column, 'ITFN
