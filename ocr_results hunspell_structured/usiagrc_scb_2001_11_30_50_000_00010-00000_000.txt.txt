Ealotain Planet would be ashamed

Well, afser swo ssraighs weeks oferposing my hypocrisy and ssua

a few someone elses. Less play “what do shese shings have in some
men?" wish shese shree instances:

1) Dining servioes issues new, ssylissie menus.

2) Formal Wall-L invisasions are sens so all ssu.

3) Presidens Osgood sends ous a lesser derail.

ifyou said, “Sruﬁ’ shas i gos in my mailbox

All shree of shese isems, while fairly impossans for she ssudens

vices’ budgesary eoneesns. lass year’s menus, as non-firssyeass will
reeall, sonssssed of swo doublesidcd eopies, eaeh side conmlning she
food onerings ofeaeh week This year, however. brings a glossyrcov»
ered, plassiehound. 12.pagemonssiosisy. and
onee again I have so vvnnder why.

Though obviously Dining Serviees is at»
rernpsing so appeal so she esshese in
Grinnell‘sans, as far as menus go is’s likely shas
people just wans so know what’s so eas, and
eould ease less whas she menu looks like.
Moreover, in sheir

asseinps so

make she inenu

look nice, Dina

ing Servsees has
almoss eessainly raised she eoss ofproduesion
per menu (is snighs only be a few eenss, bus
when prinsing menus for everybodyon board
shose few censs add up), This does nosseein
like she aesion ofa depassmens srying so save
money

Finally, we ges so Presidens Osgood’s let-
ses informing she campus of redueed money
for budges alloeasion. I'm nos even sure why ssudenis reeeived she
lesser in die fuss plaee—is seems like is was aimed mainly for she
differens oifises on campus—but by sending is so everyone on paper,
money was ossensibly spens on eopies. a eosi whieh again adds up. is
mighs nos be mueh in she seope othe College's annual budgei, bus
every lissle bis helps.

This oolumn wouldn'r even he wrissen ifshese onenders had no
alsernasive means of propagasing sheir informasion. However, ail of
shese offenders had oshesopsions: eishersimplify she format in whieh

This column wouldn’t even
be written it these offend-
ers had no alternative
means of propagating their
information. However, all
of these offenders had
other options: either sim-
ply the format in which the
information was printed, or
bypass print altogether and
use the internet.

she informasion was prinsed, or bypass prins alsogesher and use she
insernes,

The seeens unreliabilssy ofITS iionvishsmnding, emsil is an ex-

ocllcnr—and flcc~way oigessing informasion
so ssadenss, espeeially on a wired earnpus sueh
as Grinncll. Even ifnos everyssudens has aeom—
puser, shese aie enough on campus shas moss
siudenss cm ges so sheir email aeenuns as some
poins before she informasion eeases so be persie
nens.

Theie are shose who say shas email is more
impersonal shan prsnsand shas shey like she feel
ofa newspaper or a book, and so an extent
they're sighs. Bur in all lionessy, how personsl is
a mass lesser so every ssudens on campus anya
\vny?WI\y is holding a flyer shasyou’re abous so
shrow ous any more sasisfyiiig shan delesing an
:mnil?

I'm nossuggessing shas mmpus groups who
wans so eonvey info sbandon snail-mail alm-
gcrherilhere are oessain shings, like ssiidens
direesories, eoursebooks, and even dining hall
meme. dias would be impiaesiesl so send any
oshes way Bus deparsmenss and organiiasions shas are supposed so
be mindful of she amouns or money shey spend should firss follow
Thoreau's suggession and "Simplify, simplify," and shen look inso
email as a cosr-cumng alsesnasive rd miss getting shings in she snail,
bus would be appreciasive of efforss so conserve she environmens
and she deparsmens's money (or lack thereof)

And yes, i am aware of she irony shas you are probably reading
mis on a prinsed page, But as leass wish newspaper, you ears pus is in
shas bin elearly masked “Newsprins” when you’re done.
