"Originally I was billed to talk about nonviolence, but be:
cause there was a rumor that proved to betrue,1'llbe address-
ing you tonight as the Sotialist Party candidate tor President,“
said David Mciicynolds, commenting wryly on the SEA Cabinet's
Withdrawal of compensation for his speech on Monday night.
”I have the right to speak anywhere, but you may not hear me.
Money is not the issue. Nor is getting office, because running
under the Socialist Party USA you aren't going to be elected "
He smiled, .

Thirtyrone Gnnnell students heard McReynolds that evening,
He divided his speech into two halves: the ﬁrst discussed pdtir
nm and his argument for it (”You have to make room For cow-
ards"), and the second outlined his platform and that of the
party he represented

”Build a movement that can involve the weakest, or you'll
be stuck with a very elitist movement,” McReynoldS said, He
discussed his view of capitalism as elitist and argued that it
needed to be ended, while admitting the innability of his goal:
”We could fit the entire radical left movement in this country
into a stadium.‘.,. Our job is to keep the violence out of the
movementibecause we can be larger that way."

Another message was empathy. ”Never dehumanize human-
ity. ihere is not one in this room who is not capable or being
one of the German guards at Auschwitz," And not. one of us is
not capable at being one of the people that calmly ﬁled into
the gas chambers.” He said that people tend to ascn'tie ills to
others, and that such a mentality could lead to disaster.

his discussion or the Socialist Party platform was impasr
sioned but straightforward: he advocated a 50% cut in Penta-
gon spending and an end to sanctions, the dismantling or all
prisons, the end of ”a disastrous war on drugs," universal health
care, a 10.1 ratio between maximum and minimum wages, and
an improvement of interatummunity public transport.

After concluding with a poem and answering several stun
dent questions, the 70 year old retiree picked up a threadbare
purple backpack and continued on his circuit of the state,

menr, a new wave orboomers are headed orrro college.

The large number nfbabies born in ihe lare 19805 and the early
1990s began this "boomlei," said Travis Reindl, policy analyst for the
American Association More colleges and Universities.

As these boomers reach their 18th birthdays, college enrollment
is expected to increase by 26 perceni nationwide, Reindl said. Begin
ning as soon as 2002, me naiion‘s colleges will have to deal iviih
these increasing numbers

But this recent baby boom will be more geographically specific
than the last, he said. The Wesr will have the largest increases, with
some areas seeingar least a 40 percent increase, and the Midwest will
experience the smallest growth, he said.

"it's going ro be much more intense in some places," Relndl said.
"Some stares are already dealing with some really strong issues."

Those issues include keeping siudeni-to-raeulry ratios low, hous-
ing and Feeding studears and orrering enough classes. These are top
ies that most orihe couriiry‘s universiries will have to look at eveiiiu—
