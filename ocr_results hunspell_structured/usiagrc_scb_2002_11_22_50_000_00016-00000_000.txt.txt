It’s the last thing Grinnell's opponents want to
hear, but here it is; the Pioneers are even deeper
this year.

“With our rop 12 scorers re-
turning and the addition of 6-8
rust.year Paul Nordlund, I am
very excited at our prospeers,"
said head coach Dave Arsenault
as his team prepared for

in Soaring and three—poinishooting for a tend1 00n-
seeuiive year, although last year's 124.9 points per
game might be a rough number to beat."

124. 9 poino per grime will, indeed be tough
to bear, given that no other team in NCAA history
has done it before Grinnell 3 frenetlc full court at-

west Conference in the process. Nevertheless,
Grinnell was knozkﬁd out in the ﬂI‘SK round ofthc
playoﬂ’s and failed to repeat as eonremnee shampo.
