I fcvor the present Selective

Service Act for the following rea-
sons: .
1. it stands as something of al
barrier to the establishment of
Universal Military Training. As
long as the armed forces can Se-
cure through volunteers and se-
lectivc service all of the men they
can use, their arguments for U
M. T. will carry less weight than
'without the draft.

2. Selective service gives notice,
to all possibly aggressar nations‘
that the United States intends to
remain in a position to bring its
full strength to bear at short no-
tice. This is essential in the world
as it exists now.

3. It is a. purely emergency mea-

Conscription is a. denial of ac.
mocrscy; using it we imitate the
totalitarian state, It is based on s
fslsc conception of the American
system of government with its
suhordinstion of the military to
civil rule. It presupposes that
police must be built on power, a
false concept. it implies that we
must impose our leadership for
justice and peace on the world. It
will not quiet the suspicions and
win the cooperation of other nu-
tions. . l

The only purpose of this urmy,l
as an instrument of American for» .

do not make for peace, as all his

made conscription irrelevant to the
warfare of the future.

By conscription we lose the frec-
dom we seek to preserve.
