many joint faculty/student research pron
-_iects. especially the chemistry depart
meilt. and Roscntleld is committed to lure
thering joint faculty/student research pro-
Jet-ts in the social sciences. Moyer said.
”these grants are pregnant with
possibilities " ‘ . -

The hoseiitield program has an
operating budget ot just over $50,000 an-
nually and a little over hall at this goes
toward speakers, syniposiums. and cone
lcl'eilces. The balance is used to fund inn
ternships. independent projects. iaeulty

Dean ot Facult. and student committee
members are elected by these faculty
members in the spring for the fall

process ol the committee is to “wait for

quately represent the conservative point ot‘

that these accusations gave Roseiilieltl a

hloycr stated that the Roscillleld pro

which has a politically lioeral
orientation. i\loye added that the liosciir

philosophy. "let a lliousaiid tiowers

When asked about the ditliculties he on-
couutcred in directing the Roseiliield pro

problems ol coordinating the calendar ol
scheduled events lie explained that
ltosciiliclti must compete tor time with
other campus organizations and conse-
queiitly popular months .such as April
create scheduling nightmares ittoyei- said
he would attempt to move more Rosenileid
programs into the niooths. such as
November and February. which have
relatively leucr scheduled events

As expected. Moyer said that tiiiancial
constraints are alttays an obstacle. yet he
stressed Rosellfield's emphasis on
"speakers who are academics ivitli a good
lamlliaritv with the'subject and who are
much ch aper than expensive. big name
speakers." Meyer also stated that Griilnell
sometimes encounters difficulties schedul-

the east coast to Grinnell and back.

“Quality, not quantity." Moyer exclaim-

Meyer expects the Rosenfield committee

This new effort to “diversify” college

Johnson. Equitable access was given. and
consequently, more black students. mostly

enroll in colleges and universities, Cot
leges were ”diversified,"

However, although the question of in)!
to attain diversity seemed to be answere t.
colleges and universities throughout tte
country soon realized that this countr/‘s

A high level at sensitiVity to these
