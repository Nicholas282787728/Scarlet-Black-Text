which would be ot a very popular
nature, and yet oi such a highl
character as to suit the ntost‘
exacting. Under the inﬂuence at
an unqualiﬁed recommendation oi
an Iowa College alumnu. they hit
upon this company. not without
some tear that perhaps the at
traction was of too popular a

have since been dispelled. partly
because of the assurances and con-
gratulations they have ieceived
from lriends in other cities, who
have had the prrvtlege or hearing
the company, and partly by a
mass or press clippings which
have been sent them.

In the Yo/w’a Blade for Jan. 2 is
a program showing the versatility
