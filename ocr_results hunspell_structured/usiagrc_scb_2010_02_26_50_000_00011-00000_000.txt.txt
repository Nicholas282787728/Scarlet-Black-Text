founder of Upriglzl citizens Bl‘lgl‘ade and will be aim-ring
in a new TVs/low Prayer-a on Spike, Mai/how Bee/ire” '13
spoke wil/r [tuber/s over r/re phone on Wednesday.

When did you ﬁrst get interested in sketch comedy?
Wcll l was a tan,as a kid, orMonty Python. and then I got
interested in doing it througliiactually at Grinnell—wc starred
an improv group, It was called ‘Protcus.'1 had gone away and
done a semester [abroad] and I’d also done a summerwith the
National Shakespeare conservatory, so I came back and wanted
to start an acting workshop, and one otthe other women that
I'd played with, I told her that, and she said, ‘No,l want to start
something, do my thing: And her thing was, she was rrom
Chicago and worked with the Piven Theater Company, which
does story theater and develops improvisatron,so I joined that
group and we started doing improv together. That lasted for

a few years after I lett, but then it disbanded unfortunately. I
always thought it was so cool that it still :xisted, you know

When did you ﬁrst get into television or movie acting?

I guess the ﬁrst time we started doing that was when we all
moved to New York. We had all been in Chicago, and that's
where we met all the Upright Citizen’s Brigade guys, and then
we moved to New York and srartcd doing Conan O'Brieu’s show,
a sketch on rhiit, and then we got our own show iifrcr about a
year—The Upright Citizen’s Brigade Sketch Show. That was
the beginning of my doing TV shows, We spent a lot of years
sort ofincubaring here in Chicago doing stage sturr, wcird little
shows.

What led to the creation ofth: Upright Citizen's Brigade?
Around 1990, we met through the lmprov Olympics,which

was one orthose things where the main teacher was this guy
JerrFullerton. He's the guy who trained Bill Murray, and John
Belushi and John Penn. He hasjust this hugc list ofhasicaﬂy

all the good sketch comedians. We all studied there, pcrformcd
there, then started our own sketch group out of there, somewhere
around ’90, ’91.

Could you tell me a little bit about“PIiiycrs"? I don’t watch TV
much anymore.

It’s not out yet, so even if you watched it you wouldn’t know
about it. Ir airs March 2, and it rcvolvcs around two brothtrs
who own a bar together, and are basically polar opposites. My
guy's very uptight, comes from a world ofcorporatc chain
restaurants, and is almys trying to impose order and, Tm the
establishment,‘ and I’ve got this brother, who's the guy everybody
likes, the rwmrlme Charlie guy, who's basically the bane of my
existence. And every episode involves monkeying abourilhese
guys get in conﬂicts, the other guy has a terrible idea, my guy
docs damage control.

How long have you been working on "Players"?
We ﬁlmed it for about six months. it's all improvised, the

tliuloguc.Wc have scenarios tor 10 episodes, where we act out
the plot orraeh scenario, and make up the dialogue as we go
along, We ﬁnished quite a while ago, but it's only airing now
There were a number orconsidcrations (or pushing it back.

Considerations like what?

Well one was the winter Olympics, actually. B:causc,you know,
it’s about sports, the spike network, so you want to think about
something that gears towards college, spring break There were
all kinds orthings—one was that they were getting the rights to
rc>run Entourage. Thought that would be a good leadrin, so wc
had to wait until they got those rights. That didn't happen ‘ril the
New Year. There was another show they put on that they wanted
to air ﬁrst, so there were all kinds ofconsiderations, really. We
finished up last summer, and now it's airing.

And you're really happy with how it turned out?
Yeah. It's really great when you get with a network who's younger
in their original programming, because they tend to be very open
to letting you get you’re way. And they were rantastic, and they
really basically let us do whatever wc want. I can remember how
the show used to be, because it’s what we wanted to do, And it
kind orreally bags you when network producers kill the show,
and you really want to know how it could’vc gone if youd done it
your way, but that's not the case.

over the course oryorrr career, have you worked with any big
comedians.>

well Amy Pochlcr is pretty successhrl these days, She was on
“Parks and Reereation,"she was one or the people on thatTV
show, Adam McKay, who is a writcrrdireetor, who directed a
bunch orWill Farrell movies,‘Anchorman,"“Tal.ladega Nights,"
“stepbrothers." He was one or the rounding members or the
Upright Citizen’s Brigade. Horatio Snnz was one or the haunding
members who was on SNL for about seven years. Who clsc?
0h,Tina Fey. We both came out orlmprov Olympics together,
and she's performed regularly at our theater in New York. 1 know
a bunch ofguys I took classes with have done pretty good stuff,

I‘m a little curious now—why was it called the Upright
Citizen’s Brigade?

It was kind of an ironic name. We used to do shows that were
pretty crazy, right, wed take people out of the theater, stage a
fake suicide or run the audience down the block to a friend’s
house and have them watch a murder through the window orthc
house, and so we thought a name like that sounded like we were
very strict, and proper, and socially conscious. I think we just
kind orthought it was a funny name.

During your time working with them, have there ever been any
roles that you've just reauy liked performing?

I liked this sketch Ass Pennies that I had. It’s something that has
always been kind ora role I really enjoyed doing the sketch on.
stage. Yeah, maybe that. We played all different roles. We weren't
the kind otsketch show that had a lot ofrccurring characters.

Grinnelians invade MBLGTACC in Madison, Wis.

Grinnell students interact with and learn about other students from across the Midwest

5v ELIZA-EVE LEAS

Last weekend, almost 30 Grinnellians attended the
Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgendcr Ally college
Conferencc (MBGLTACC) in Madison, Wis. to discuss
sexuality, gender and queer issues.

“I really hoped to go to MBLGTACC and further leads
ership experiences, learn about new outlooks, get workshop
information...and bring that back to campus and imple-
ment some of thc things that I learned," Nik Jameson ’11
said.

Others were cxcitcd to have the chance to inreracr with
a large number ot queer students from all over the Mid
west.

“1 really wanted to go to an event where I got to meet
lots orother queer people," Colleen Waiekrnan ’13 said.

Grinnellians attended workshops such as “B‘rCuri—
ousP", “The Idiot’s Guide to Asexualiry" and "Gender
chaser 101." During these workshops, they met queer sws
dents and round out more about life on campuses across

the Midwest.

“I wanted to learn more about where gay rights were in
undergraduate institutions,"]on Richardson '10 said.

It seemed like Grinnell does pretty well by its queer
students compared to other institurions.

“We're very lucky to have a lot or resources and a lot
or knowledge. it was really interesting to see people from
other schools and get a feel orwhere they are at with their
programs...it made me realize how lucky we are," Elliot
Karl '12 said. “We have a greater knowledge and vocabulary
to be able to talk about these issucs more specifically.”

Qi'ttc a few students voiced a desire to help other cam—
puses to reach the same level, but simultaneously noted
rhar a lot of the workshops designed to aid this process
were superﬁcial.

“They could have done a better job making the sessions
a little more advanced for people who are more welleversed
in queer issues already," Richardson said.

According to several students at the conference, the

conferencc lacked nuanced explanations and understand-
ings of complex issues, especially those related to trans
people and queer people orcolor.

According to Waickrmn, the QPOC caucus also voiced
complaints or being tokenized throughout the conrerenee,
a problem that spilled over trom the University orWiseon-
sin-Madison.

The issues students found at MBLGTACC, and what
they learned about other campuses, sparked greater ins
rcresr in working to change things. Jameson mentioned
bringing back Bifocal, a bisexual student group on campus,
and increasing discussions about scxuallties oursid: of ho—
mosexual and heterosexual, such as pan— or asexual.

“A lot or the ﬁrst and second years will carry these is
sues forward after gclting inspired to work and advocate
for queer people," Richardson said.

Karl was deﬁnitely inspired.

“It made me more passionate about these issues,” he
said.
