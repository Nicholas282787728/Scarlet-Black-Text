Security: date rape drugs re-
ported in use on campUs

This semester, Grinnell College Security sent out two dif~
ferent campus bulletins warning students that date-rape drugs
may be on campus. While it appears there were no assaults or
attacks due to these drugs, the administration is urging stir
dents to take extra precautions.

Security Director Steve Briscoe says this is not the first time
these types of drug use has been suspected on campus. “I sent
[security bulletins] out twice last semester and two times
this semester," he said.

According to both Briscoe and Vice President of Student
Services Torn Crady, multiple students came to the administra-
tion “We had some students report to us that they’d been given
a very srrong tranquilizer," said Crady.

These students were not (ested‘for any date rape drugs, ac-
cording to Briscoe. “The reports they were giving were in line
with the symptoms they'd exhibit were they on drugs,”hc said.

Crady spoke with Grinnell police recently in response to
campus concerns. “They indicated there’d been some problems
in town," he said. securiry and the police department are work
ing together to find more information.

“Ifwe catch who's doing this, there are going to be some
serious consequences,” said Briscoe. “It's not going to be taken
lightly."Briscoe hopes students will come forward with any in
formation about the presence ofdate rape drugs on campus. “If
somebody has information and wants to be anonymous, they
can call me and 1 will assure them oftheir anonymity,"he said.

Beyond these investigations, the SGA Safety and Security
Advisory Committee (SSAC) is currently looking into preven»
tative measures. According to Briscoe, the committee will look
into products that test drinks for these drugs.

. Even though it appears no assaults occurred as a result of
these drugs this year, there have been in the past. “We have had
situations in years past where we believe there have been drugs
associated with date rapes." said Crady.

Until Security knows more, Briscoe asks students to pay
attention to their surroundings. “Don’t leave your drink out.
Don't drink other people's drinks," he said, “and if you feel
you’ve been [a] victim, get help."

Briscoe recommends calling a number orresources includ-
ing DVA/SAC, the Grinndl police department, the Chaplains
Office, an RLC, Security or the Health Center.

Visitors welcome to take
shuttle to U of I hospital

Crash, cont. from p; l

for gas and food expenses. cards and stuffed animals brought
to Student Affairs will be delivered to the hospital. Chaplain
Deanna Shorb and Janet Alexander, director of International
Student Services, alternate shifts at the hospital to counsel
family and friends.

Younes and Rojas Aguilera have visited their friends in
the hospital several times. Rojas Aguilera said Student Affairs
talked to the professors and “gave people more time to think
about their friends, which at times like this is more important '
than academics."

Friends have visited every day from the morning the stu—
dents arrived at the hospital. crady said, when he ﬁrst arrived
on Sunday, “The only thingI was asked to do was keep studenrs
our of rhe ward."

Now that the families have arrived, friends are encouraged
to visit. According to close friend Laura Lienemann ’08 and
Sam Lancaster '08, Goto and Rojas Aguilera’s SA and friend,
Coburn was in a lot of pain on their ﬁrst visit but was joking
around later in the week. They said Goto’s family welcomes
visitors and invites them to bring photos and stories about
Goto, though visiting blocks are short and broken up through
out the day.

Student Affairs plans to maintain services to students visit-
ing Coburn and Goto in the hospital for as long as needed,
though Goto's stay will probably be longer than Coburn's. Ale
Exander said, “Ifhe’s going to be there a long time, I think he’ll
need long-term support.”

For the record: correction
from our last issue

in the News story titled m; in smoke,“ we
mistakenly wrote that smoking is forbidden
in all campus ioggias, including the open
loggnas on East and North campus There
is no policy regarding the East and North
Campus ioggias, and smoking is allowed
