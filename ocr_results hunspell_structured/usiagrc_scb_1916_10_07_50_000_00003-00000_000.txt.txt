TUNEFUL MARTHA
AT THE BERCllEL

opening Perforlllhncc By the lioston
English Grllnd Opera Company
IS Brilliant Success.

Des Mollieg Register, Sept. 23, 1916:
Martha danced into town last night
and iiung open the doors of the Ber-
chel theater to legitimate musical
comedy in the shape at Flolow's
charming old Opera, "Martha," pre-
sented by the Boston English Grand
Opera company, of which Joseph Sheev
hon is the nerticuiar bright and shin—
ing light. The nndience was won at
the first by the excellent rendition of
tﬁ-ovcrtnre and enire act music
which has so long heen absent in Des
iioincs as to seem almost an innova-
tion when revived.

The tuneful melodies of the chem
are not limited to the soloists cf the
company, Rollicking choruses or o
l‘llslic tallg, lllc sentimental ballads of
another generation, and the spirited
and besutiiul solos and cnscrnlrie mim—
laws are as vital nnd'nnnealing in the
revival of ”Martha.” as when it was
first produced and contrast strongly
and favorably with the syncopated on.

Kansas City Post, Sent. 25, 1916:
Kansas City opera lovers could not
ash a better sonson opener than that
given by the Boston English Opera
company, playing “Martha" at tho
shuhcrt theater this week, '

And one thing that makes the “Mill'-

are rive stars and n chorus of pretty

better then when he was last seen with
the Kansas City Grand Opera com<

pressed, but last night be sung full
and clear, yet sort and convincing,
when he wished. As the opera pro—
gressed he gut better, singing with
nhnndon and case that won him well
corned encores.

Perhaps the audiencc last night was

as much pleased with Mr. Shechnn's
