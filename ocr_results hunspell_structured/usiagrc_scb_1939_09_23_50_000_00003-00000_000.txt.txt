shun-day,— September 23, 19 9

To you freshmen, the transition from high
school to college is, perhaps, the biggest
that you have yet made. Some of you are
“on your own" for the first time, some of
you are perplexed by the buildings, some
of you are blinded by tlle light of knowledge
exuding from your professor’s eyes, and
most of you, if you \\ ill be honest, are con-
fused,

During the next few weeks, you will come
in contact with a host of new and strange
ideas—in the class room, in chapel, in the
various campus organizations, or in a “bull-
session" with fellow students. How you
will react to these new trends of thinking
is, of course, a personal problem, A word
of counsel, however, may not be amiss.

In high school you were taught to absorb
material presented you rather than analyze
it. It would be only natural for you to do
the same here, but Grinnell College has al~
ways encouraged its students to be inde
pendent in their thinking.

It is a common saying that college stu—
dents are herd-minded. Indeed, it is easy
to follow the line of least resistance and
accept the opinions of others, especially if
they are laid down by selfrconfident and
popular uppervclassmeni To be sure, think-
ing for oneself is a painful process, but it
is indispensable for obtaining a sound college
education and in solving one’s individual
problems in later life.

There is a crying need for leaders who
are also thinkers in a distressed and de»
crepit world. Grinnell freshmen, we invite
you to ioin the fellowship of independent

thinkers.

THE COLLEGE OF TOMORROW

Reprinted from the Texas Christian “Skiff.”
Quality, not quantity, is the aim of higher
education

The qualitative aspects of education are
the most far-reaching; the quantitative
aspects a a problem of educational degree.
The principle has been that of providing as
lnuch education as one is willing to work
for, and our secondary schools and colleges
have greatly increased their enrollment in
the past few years, at a considerable ex»
pense to the public,

But this has not fulfilled the aim of
quality, but of quantity. The question is,
how to educate both those who are able to
attend college and those who deserve to go
to college, to the benefit of the public at
large, in view of our democratic nation.
The essential of democracy in America is its
quality.

‘ about these things?

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

I
The colleges of tomorrow must reject and
weed out those who have not the will to
lealn. They must carry out a principle of
democratic education and perpetuate the
qualities of individualism in their students,
[or the nation of tomorrow is made from
the youth of today.

FLYING BLIND?

Being p0 tive that you’re right on some
‘ tters is similar to flying blilldi

01‘ course, it is a good thing to be cer-
"lill about other things. It’s a help if one
is certain he knows what he wants to buy
l'llell he enters a store. It‘s fine if a stuv
dent is certain he has answered correctly 21
question ill the class rooml It helps a per—
son solve many problems of registration and
exil' curricular activities if he is fairly
certain of the type of vocation he wishes
to follow.

There are, however, many situations ill
which certainty is a dangerous thing. One
such situation is at election time. Certain-
ty that some one candidate is so much better
than others as to exclude consideration of
those others is dangerous. War provides
another time when certainty is perilous,
No one can honestly declare that he knows
\lhat will happen or what should be done,
Government plans and projects also defy
positivcness. Such plans are almost ills!
variably experimental,

Why is it dangerous to have convictions
It might seem that one
must have complete assurance ill order to
procced with, or accomplish, any plans, and
obviously something must be done in all
those situations, Yet it is exactly the same
‘ blind flying. When one thinks he knows
What will happen or what should be done,
he is excluding—blinding hilnselfito ally
other possibilities, and refuses to consider
any other possibilities.

The danger lies ill the probability that
something else will happen, with a conse
quent disintegration of the person and his
plans,

Lack of certainty, however, does not mean
lack of plans or activity. It means that
these plans will be lnore flexible and adap-
table to any possible situation It does not
mean that one should refuse to proceed in
any definite lille, for all indications often
suggest that one definite line is rigllt, but
it does mean that one should not disregard
other possibilities, One should not look
merely at his instrument board and neglect
a look-out for other planes. One should not
fly blin Even at night, or in a fog, there
are lights on the other aircraft.

WE TAKE A BOW

(Reprinted from the Albia, 1a,, Republican)
A good editor is one who has never made a
mistake; who never has offended anyone;
who is always right; who can ride two
horses at the same time he is straddling a
fence with both ears to the ground; who al»
ways says the right thing at the right time;
who always picks the right horse as well as
the right politician to will; who never has to
apologize; who has no enemies, and who has
worlds of prestige with all classes, creeds
and races. There has never been a good ed-
itor.

PROGRESS inﬁrm?

Now that we have begun to cure ourselves
of heading into the open reserve shelves on
our way ollt of the library; now that the
new faces on the campus are beginning to
assume some degree of familiarity; now
that we have observed and forgotten the
way all the girls are wearing those long
sweaters buttoned at the top; now that we
have become acclimated to the smell of newly
painted walls; we can begin to reassure our—
selves that Grinnell really is quite the same
old place.

Just as it was last year, there are wrong
classrooms to walk into, and breakfasts to
sleep through by accident, and old friends
to meet in the old places. We fear, even,
that cokes will no longer taste quite the
some, Who would have thought of itiblue
walls for the Dixie?

The unique style 0! Glen Hillel" band is achieved by his sealing
l'cl- foul Saxophones and one clar et. The clalmet and fourth tenor
sax carry the melody an octave apart, with the two altos and second
tenor filling in harmony between these two. It is this scoring which
gives the Miller music its distinctive pl-ettmees, that sets off both
good and bad tunes, and substantially relieves the monotony oi pops
which make up the dance sets. The brass section complements this
sax sct-up wuh simple, usually fetching ﬁgures, lather lightly sup-
ported by the rhythm.

\VHY

TOMMY nonsnr's Monday midnight broadcast has star-rein
something. One of the features of this program is a musical explana-
tion of each number. Now the networks are adopting this idea rui-
other late night dance programs as a result of the many requests
that followed. This educational crusade may revolutionize populm-
music appisclatioh. and give longevity to transient hit times; be»
cause of the fact that one of the basic plihciples of classical music
appreciation is a background knowledge of the music and its com-
posers.

\Vatc-ll your daily papers for news about the federal monopoly
investigation of tho band-booking business. At the present time,
four big companies have the mime blinds, radio outlets, record coili-
panies iuul dance spots just about completely tied up. This investu
gutioh, although it is moving slowly, should result in some sci
tionzll development; it these orgnni'mtimls are round guilty bl violin-

Larry, and his selections were made from a. musical standpoint. In
