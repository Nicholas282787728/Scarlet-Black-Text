If there Is one thing that Grinnclllans
like to talk about, it is food. Fortu—
nately, the recent changes in the din-
ing hall give ample opportunity to ex-
pound on the subject.

The noticeablc lack of cycle menus
forces one to generalize, however,
(Apparently, food Services works un—
der the theory that what we don’t know
can’t hurt us.) Still, I feel that it is my
duty as a foodreating member of
Grinnell society to say rude and im»
pertinent things about the changes. It
took a year's worth ofwhining, but we

finally got that mysterious yet subr
lime Character known as Dave
McConnell to surge into action from
a previous state of ennui. (Or would
that be Enya?)

I must admit, the changes have
caused some problems. For the first
lime, it is notjust firstryears who stare
humbly at the array of food items in
line in a confused manner. Under the
banner of self-service, we have dis-
covered that we have the collective
decisionrmaklng power oftubc socks
(and not the striped kind, either),

Ycars before, I would just Clank a
few plates onto my tray, determine
after three bites that I hated all of it,
and then abandon it for a bowl of
cocoa puffs, now I freeze up when-
ever I go through the line, hoping that
the ﬂicker of panic that crosses my
fact: is not obvious. ‘Carrots or broc—
coli?’ I think to myself, terrified that
I will choose incorrectly and be
sucked into an alternate reality. In»
eVltably, I take both, eat three bites

of each, and then move on to Golden
Grahams.

During my brief 97-minute wait for
lunch one day last week. I was able to
check my c-mail (twice), do a load of
laundry. and peel the lamination off
of my ID card. By the time I had actu-
ally entered the mystical double doors.
I tended to agree with the thoughtful
comment cards such as “We need a
heroin bar" and “Please allow us to
strangle all line-cutters,"These people
erribody all the spirit and enthusiasm
essential to the Grinnell experience.
An aside to the valiant and courageous
members of the dining hall Commit
tee who so nobly proclaimed: ”Give
me selfrsurvc or give me dcath!": the
two are roughly equivalent.

This is not to say, of course, that
nothing good came out of the dining
hall's extensive overhaul. For return-
ing students, the changes were noth—
ing short of miraculous.

'Anyone who saw the student staff
skits will concur; a halfdozen students

from the Lnngan/Rawson/Gates staff
bounded across the Harris stage with
Baryshnikov-like agility, apparently in
a celebratory dance to honor the new
Juice machines. i know that personally,
when I talk to graduates of Grinnell, the
first thing I tell them is not about the
extensive changes made on the Fine
Arts and Science buildings. but about
the fact that we have a deli bar every
day.

Indeed, thanks to the alert and ever-
watchful presence of the sack lunch
ovcrsccrs,,l can now stock my lunches
With 57 points worth of food, rather than
the usual 15. And. since Sheila has not
yet taken to strip searching all exiting
diners, a few people (though I know
none personally) have left Cowles and
Quad with fruit hidden in strategic (and
usually inappropriate) places.

But I digress. It’s almost time for
lunch, and I can hardly wait to see if
tofu pudding is being served. because,
as we all know, different is better. And
ignorance is bliss.

Here I sit, waiting for the first oftwo
drying cycles to complete in the laun-
dry room behind me. It’s Saturday the
7th and the basement of Main could
not be any more refreshingly cool,

I don't always feel like I‘m in a
sauna, My classes (especially my tu»
torial in the partiallyrrefurbished sci-
ence building) are quite cool, in fact.
They tend to break up the muggy day
with an hour or so of coolness. Nev-
ertheless, the rest of the day feels like
the heat is crawling into every crevtce
of my body, exposed or not. Thcrc,
the warmness dwells until my body
squeals in uncolnfort and and itching
desire to find a lake and dive in.

Even this morning brought the
steamincss that has become ever-so-

 

familiar around here. I lugged a box
over to the post office Jusl shy of
eleven-thirty. Along the way, 1 cast
an occasional glare up at the sun and
swore under my breath,

On my way back, I looked around
the town of Grinnell. It had yet to
wake, save an occasional pick-up
truck or a strolling couple. For the
first time. I regretted not having
brought a bike with me to school.

Before I came to Grinnell two
weeks ago, the image I had in mind
was one of a spacious, laid-out
school, [expected cornfields galore,
visible from any given positron. I
still have the inner desire to spend a
night in a cornfield, or at least tour
one for an afternoon, even in light of
the blistering heat.

Come to think ofil, I haven‘t even

ing halls, you say? Nope. The locker

Herbie Hancock Show on Thursday,
As I walked into the gym that night, I
knew I was in trouble when my clothes
immediately stuck onto my skin, as if
I had been turned into a magnet for
fabric.

At night, the heat can be seen line
gcring in the air over the ground in a
thick mist, as if it were a white blan-
ket tucking in the campus grounds for
the evening.

As of today, we haven’t been
touched by rain. No help from the sky
to wash away some of this heat.

Heat

From what it appears, we‘ll be stuck
with this weather for a bit longer. I wish
the fall would arrive. It's always been
my favorite season. I'm not sure if it’s
because of the colored leaves falling to
the ground like globs of paint layering
an ease], or if it’s the crispness that
comes with each autumn, like a reward
for surviving the blistering summer.

Maybe it’s because a new school year
begins, a chance to start anew. 0r
maybcit’s simply because my birthday
lies in September.

Well, it’s time to check on my laun-
dry now. Pretty soon, I‘ll be leaving
this cool-temperatured room and will
reunite with the rest ofthe campus. And
what a sizzling campus it is. Neverthe
less. soon enough the fall will arrive.

h I like the Sound of that.
