Have you ever navigated the rough terrain of the
Forum in a wheelchair or with crutches? Attend»
ed a candidate talk when you arc hard of hearing?

. Thought about what the term “disability" means?

The Ad Hoc Committee on Issues of Disability
at Grinnell formed about a ycar ago to discuss these
issues, among many others. The committee seeks to
educate members of the Grinnell community about
issues ofdisabilily and to promote
the inclusion ofissues ofdisability
in the curriculum, said Associate
Dean and Director of Academic
Advising Joyce Srcrri‘91,co-chaii

The committee continues to examine the differ.

ence between simply complying with the measures
of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
truly achieving a “disability-friendly” environment.
Consistent with this aim, another ofthe committee’s
goals is to recruit peoplewith disabilities to Grinnell
and retain those who are already here.

“Clearly all of these goals begin with basic edur

tiatives," Stern said, "To this end, we thought we
should begin \vith something that everyone can re
late to—the laws we currently have governing equal
access for persons with disabilities."

Partly in celebration of the 15th anniversary of
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the committee
will bring Peter Blanck, director ofthe Law, Health
Policy and Disability Center at the University of
Iowa Law School, to campus to discuss the civil
rights of people with disabilities
next week.

Blanck, who has written nus
incrous books on civil rights and
disabilities, has also represent-
ed clicnrs before the suprcrnc
” Court in ADA cases and is a
senior fellow ar the Annenberg
Washington Program, a public
policy center. An American Sign
Language (ASL) interpreter and
realrtiuic captioning will accomr
pnny Blanck's talk.

Stern argues that this is an issue affecting all
students and urges them to attend Blanck's talk. “I
hope that many students will come to the talk and
participate. If nothing else, students should realize
that eventually most people become disabled, if not
in their youth. then as they age," Stern said. “None
ofus will be free from these issues touching our lives
one way or another, so it pays to be informed

“We would also be very interested in know—
ing what the broader interests and concerns are of
other students, staff and faculty on campus who we
haven't heard from.”
