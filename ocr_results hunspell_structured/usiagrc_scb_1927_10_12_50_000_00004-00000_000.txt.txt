Note for Coolidges

(Continued irom Page 1).

a pleasure to see the Coolidges anti
their party but it was also a new ex-
perience (a he acquainted with so
many people who knew intshington
and national affairs. The President‘s
aides and the Secret senice men were
always willing to exillain things to
us,

“The incident most vivid to me was
the Cooli ge lawn pm to which I
was invited. The large elon'il of guests
gather-ed on a terrace in front of the
lodge. As the band played. the doors
of the lodge opened and Mr. and Mrs
Coolidge slowly descended in time (0
the music. Their appearance was so
arranged that in spite of the many
times I had seen them, I was imln‘essc
ed. The Whole Crowd fell. the same
way.

“They Came down on the lawn and
shook hands with their guests. Secret
service inen were standing hy, Watch-
ing the hands of all who came up. I
have been told that if a guest Should
approach the President with his hands
in his pockets, he would he arrested
on tho spot.”

She continued by telling of Mrs.
Coolidge’s popularity. On several oer
casions the president's Wife left (low-
Ers at the in. She was democratic
and congenial at all times. \Vhile her
husband was just as congenial, his
iamous taciturnity 'was seldon broken.

Miss Noel had the honor of belng
informally presented to the Coolidges.
They were very cordial to every one
whom they met.

The last incident has a souvenir con-
nected with it. when Colonel Chars
les A, Lindbergh ﬂew the “Spirit of
St. Louis" over the summer white
house, he dropped a note of greeting.
Josephine Noel was one of two girls
who found the scrap of naper and gave
it to the president’s body guard. After
the Coolidge’s had read the message
they returned it to the iinders. It
was written as follows: “Spirit of
St, Louis—Greeting to President and
Mrs. Coolidge. (Signed) Charles A.
Lindbergh." This scrap of paper is
prohshly in some one’s memory book
by now, along with other cherished
souvenirs of a woudcriul summer.

WANG TALKS AT
COSMO MEETIN

War Turmoil Anti Lack of Education
Causes of China’s Condition.

The Cosmopolitan club held its first
open meeting of the year Saturday
night in the Y. W. C. A. building, with
an attendance of fifty people. After a
group of songs by Loie Stephens, the
remainder of the meeting was devoted
to a talk on the political situation in
China. by Mr. Wong YuanrHsin,

His discussion centered about the
causes or the recent war in China,
There are two principal causes, ac-
cording to Mr. Wang. The first of
these was iostcred hy the iirst presi-
dent oi the Chinese R‘epuhlic, who ex-
tensively promoted the war lows of
the country. However, after his
death, there was no iollowcr of his
capable enough to carry on his pol-
icies,. and a general turmoil resulted.
His second reason for the Chinese
struggle lies in the widespread ignor-
ance ot the common people, Because
of lack oi education and the prevail-
ing illiteracy. these people have Mk»
en no interest in governmental affairs,
Education, as well as living conditions,
is inexpensive, and yet extreme pov-
erty is prevalent,

Mr. Wang belicvss that the uni,
solution for the problem of extrater
toriolity is the voluntary withdrawal
of interests by the ioroign countrios
in China.

Following the meeting, an open tor»
um was held, during which timo some
questions were raised, which M .Wang
discussed and answered

The club has discovered that there
will be vacancies for m ncw mem—
bers instead of ii as was iormerly an.

meeting for all interested, boiorc new
members are voted upon
