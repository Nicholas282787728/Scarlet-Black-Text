Space for multicultural groups?

”The space issues are going to be resolved when we
build a new building. In the meantime, we need to
look for transitional spaces. That’s why we bought
the glove factory I don’t think it’s going to be
resolved ror ﬁve years."

What would you change about Grinnell?

"I would change the lack of

communication between the president

and student aiiairs. it hurts us in a

couple of ways. No free flow of

communication causes conflicts.”

What would you keep?

"Students do have a lot of say on campus. They should continue to be
represented on important committees. SGA does a goudjob or bringing
students concerns forward.”

Approach to campaigning:

- stickers and signs

- ”I want to add a little humor and lein'cy to the campaign. My statement
or intent is going to let you now how I reel."

"For a while, i was on the master plan committee, We have to let students
know that the master plan is nothing but a strategic set of plans. What needs
to happen is some real dialogue."
Space for multicultural groups?
"1 was on the space committee For two years. The space committee evolved
its discussion to planning, and suggested things for a new campus center.
Ideas for the campus center were incorporated into the master plan. 50 the
master plan will bring us space."
what would you change about Grinnell?
"First and torernost is relationships between the campus and the town.
Grinnell, Iowa, is a very conservative town and Gi'inriell College is a very
liberal institution, but there are a whole lot or things they can offer each
other ‘1 would also like to look at expanding the concentration into a
minor; improving computing facilities, because the Imacs just don’t work;
increasing diversity. Admissions 14 years ago had a policy that worked. There
were 100 African American students then and only 35 now 1 want to
incorporate the master plan into the north and south campus divide."
what would you keep?
“Number one is Self governance I like the respect and compassion that
faculty have For the students, In some ways, 1 like the location or the
college, because the isolation gives us more focus. I
like the respectful nature or the students toward each
other, in terms or ethnic, racial, religi'ous and sexual
differences.”
Approach to campaigning:
- web page: wwwzyworld.corn/spwillrs
- posters depicting Sherman Willis as a
one of the Golden Girk. "The rumor is
true, i do watch Golden Girls every
night."
- posters and banners put together by
a campaign team.

"I don’t want this school to be a homogenous society. 1 don't want

"My idea of a world class education is not synonymous

crinnell, but I think we’re going to have to look at evenything bit by bit.

Space for multicultural groups?
”I think we've made a lot of progress in hnding space for multicultural studeiits But]
think we need to start‘lurning our Focus is little bit toward other issues regarding
multicultural groups. Because this campus is, in a way, veny much salt-segregating, and
we need to look at why that is.”
What would you change about Grinnell?
"One of the biggest things I want to address is concerns over how the money that
Grinnell has is being spent. We’re starting to see concerns being brought up. especially
academically, the humanities and social studies departments need more professors. .The
student portion of lhe trustees meeting should be opened up to the student body. It
should not be limited to the representative that the president and
wce president nominate.“
What would you keep?
"Our commitment to academic freedom and selfrgovernance,
Academic freedom is a big part or what makes this school unique, r
it’s why people come here .. Selr governance creates a social '
atmosphere on campus where people are asked to make sure to
learn how to communicate with others, to solve their
problems on a local scale.“
/ Approach to campaigning:

- "I'm trying to avoid gimmicks, I'm trying to avoid
slogans,”
- talking to people door to door
. signs

we're going to have to just represent one, because we don’t have a three thousand
square mile campus where we can do anything, There are only so many things
that will go within our technological capability and we are limited by those.”
Space for multicultural groups?

”That’s kind of a banner issue. It’s supposed to get people excited, get people
to vote for you. SGA does address multicultural issues everyday it's

not like some president is going to come in and change that."

What would you change about Grinnell?

"There’s a lot or impetus at this college to make sure everybody feels

the same and looks the same , ’unii’ying campus] and that kind of

attitude. [think the uniﬁed mind idea is wrong. And I think that the

way that can be combated is by making sure that the presidency isn't "
biased, that the by-laws are followed, that people don't get unfair

allotments of money."

What would you keep?

"Hall councils are the bedrock, not just of SGA, but of how we treat each other. In terms of campus
wide things, I have to admit I kind of like how every dorm has it's own personality like how
north campus is a little bit different than south, because I go back and forth between them, and it
feels like you're living in a big city."

Approach to campaigning:

- ”My whole thing is that a candidate needs to present how he thinks, in a personal sense To
that end, character and a sense of fairness are very important."

- ﬁrstsperson campaign, talking to people one-on-one

- ”Maybe next week I'll beef things up a little. But i certainly won’t make any stickers or make any

\promises that. I can't back up,” /
