See/es gay rights

To the editor: Last week, KDIC
hosted a program, “Meet the Presiy
dent.” Interested students could call
the station and question President
George Drake on different issues. I
Called in and asked Drake what he
thought about implementing a clause
into‘the college’s facultyvh' ‘ng con-
tract stating that discriminating on
the basis of sexual preference and/or
orientation is prohibited. As a member
or Grinnell’s gay community, l was
confused.

The president responded that Grinr
nell'College was a very “liberal" in-
stitution and that such an implementar
tio'n-Wguld be unnecessary. He added

Republicans are

To the editor: As I read my S 8: B
lastFriday, the headline “Grinnell's
orga zed activists” caught my eye.
Being rather active in the Grinnell
College Republicans, l anxiously
began reading, hoping to find news of
all the active political groups on cam-
pus.

I was somewhat puzzled to find no
mention of the Grinnell College
Republicans, After all, I thought we
had'been fairly active. having been in
volt/ed in the campaigns of Governor
Ray, Congressman James Leach, and
County Attorney Mike Mahaffey. In
the midst of this, we brought Leach on
campus along with fellow Cans
gressman Tom Railsback.

Not content to rest on our laurels
(all three won overwhelmingly), we
put together a conference featuring

Food for though

Two tons of meat, 4,000 pounds 01
produce, 9,000 eggs. four tons of milk,
1,500 pounds of cheeses and yogurt,
and tons of other food stuffs comprise
the weekly consumption by boarding
students at Grinnell.

In order to provide our board pro
gram, 36 regular staff, two ad»
ministrative staff, one secretary, a
Grill supervisor, and approximately
180 student employees, work inthe
Food Service department on campus.

It is a large undertaking. ,

During the course oi the year, it is
my hope to submit a regular column
to the S dc B that will provide informa»
tion concerning our board program
and tips on nutrition that the general
student body may find interesting and
helpful.

Nutrition has become an important
iocus in our lives. Good health habits

_ are necessary in order to maintain the

rigorous schedule of activities of stu-
dent life. We hope to provide iniorma~

The host of the program then ques-
tioned the president about facultyr
student relationships, Drake respond
ed that there was a time when this
was taboo, but that today, faculty»
studéﬂ'hrelationships are acceptable,
He then contradicted himself by
stating that he opposes sexual rela»
tionships between gay faculty
members and gay students.

Playing devil’s advocate, the host
asked Drake why he would condone

ships and oppose homosexual faculty»

activists, too

"speakers such as John Anderson, state
Republican Chairman Steve Roberts,
former Republican National Commit-
tee Chairman Mary Louise Smith, and
Professor Gerald Pomper.

I felt sure that these undertakings
had qualiﬁed us as an “activist”
organization; I certainly couldn't
think of anything more “activist” than
direct involvement in the electoral
process.

I then began scanning the list of the
achievements of Mobe and IPIRG,
hoping to discover the criteria which
had excluded us irom the category oi
an “activist” organization. The only
type oi activity in which they had parr

ticipated, and we had not, was attenr
ding demonstrations, '

Maybe I’m just confused as to what
constitutes political activity, but i sure

t

tion that will permit the students to be
selective in their loud Choices and
become more aware of what their
nutritional needs are on a regular
basis.

We want to actively discuss menu
construction and mix, in light of the
need to conserve energy on a regular
basis. A great deal of our kitchens are
electrical. Can we reduce consumption
oi electricity without destroying our
present menu concept?

We plan to embark upon a nutrition
education campaign by using informar
tional table tents in the dining halls,
developing calorie books about our
menu. and providing information
through KDIC on a daily basis. We in-
tend to hold a special dinner in the
spring that is relevant to the world
food situation, and also hope to begin
a campaign against unnecessary
waste in the dining halls.

If you are interested in these pro
jects, please stop by the Food Service
office in Main and visit. ‘

ed with a chuckle, “I guess I'm old-
fashioned,"

I believe, Drake, that you have
demonstrated rather powerfully the
necessity oi implementing a clause in
the college's iaculty hiring contract
prohibiting discrimination on the basis -
or sexual preference and/or orienta-
tion. I recommend, Mr. President,
that you up date your “old-lashioned"
Views. in addition to this, i suggest
that you reirain from following the
familiar adage, “When in Rome, do as
me Romans do.” Grinnell College
needs a leader. Cary Rasof

wish someone would enlighten me as
to why attending demonstrations is
“activitist,” while working in cam~
paigns is not. Ted Vlamis
