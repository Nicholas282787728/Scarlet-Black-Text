The Gtinnell Review
To the editor:

Recentlyl hndanexchange with
a friend: “The Review sucks so I
won’t submit “ “The Reweiv sucks
because you won't submit." We had
reached an impasse, and one that
must be overcome if Grinnell ever
hopes to produce a publication wor<
thy ofthe talented and creative peo»
ple on this campus, in order to im—
prove. the Orinne/I Revzew needs
two things: staff and submissions
This publication must have more
support in both of these areas from
the campus community. It‘s notthat
hard, and we’re not that mean. The
time commitment for staff members
is minimal, and we welcome and
implore people to join us

So this year, we're on a mission.
We're a little upset about the campus
art scene, We know there are a lot of
great Writers and artists on this cam.
pus. So why is itthot last year, we had
to accost people for submissions?
(Hey, we know you write. give us
something.) That shouldn't have to
happen, nothete atGrinnell,aliber—
al arts college,

Campus perceptions of the Re
View tend towards two camps: it’s
terrible, or it's too highbrow. Noi.
ther of these has to be true. Yes, we
do welcome academic works, and we
do maintain aselective process. But
there is no reason to view the publi»
cation as a bastion ofelitist intellec—
tual works. We don’t get enough
submissions for it to be that So, help
us be choosy. Consider submitting
And equally as important, consider
joining the staff.

Women Take Back the
Night

To the campus community:

Last Thursday was Women Take
Back the Night (WTBTN) and, like
usual, the event was both moving
and empowering. After the presen—
tation, the women marched through
town displaying their ability to literr
ally “take back the night” through
solidarity. During this march, men
met to discuss their reactions to the
evening’s events in an open men/
only forum. Or at least that was the
plan. Unrottunately, however, only
a few men attended the event and
even {fewer} remained for the men’s
discussion group. Not only did this
disappoint those of us who remained,
it also gave rise to concern that male
support for WTBTN is lacking.

Rape, sexual abuse and domes—
tic violence are not only women‘s
issues; they are societal and campus
issues which deserve every student‘s
attention. As men, we support
WTBTN as a method for women to

empower themselves in our society,
which perceives gender—based vro—
lence as both permissible andjustifi—
able, However, the struggle is not
solely about empowering women. It
is also about fuming men to examine
and realize the privilege they possess
tn a patriarchal society. Such con.
cerns have once again prompted in—
terest in starting a campus men’s
group to combai issues such as rape
and sexual assault, Hopefully. the
group will be more successful then
the numerous attempts over the past
few years and will prove that men on
the orinneli campus are finally ded.
icatedto takingactioiion these caus.
es, which have long been given lip
service. True. men cannot empower
women. Empowerment issotnething
only ind' -iduals can accomplish
themselves But ifmen are willing to
accept their position as oppressors
and [are] dedicated to work toward
changingit,thepathtowardfullgem

Students Defend the Soci—
ology Department

To the Editor:

We, the undersigned majors of
the sociology department, feel that
the recent criticisms ofthe sociology
department are unfounded antl un<
fair. to say the least The past criti—
cisms ofsociology have included the
lack ofdiversity in courses. We offer
classes on medical sociology, family,
deviance. aging, race/ethnicity, so—
cial movements, women and work,
sexuality, [and] social inequality. in
these classes, the professors make
many efforts to include readings and
discussions about race, sex, social
class. and sexual preference.

in addition. for the past two
years. the sociology department has
sponsored two minority scholars in
residence. (These are PhD, candi—
dates who are finishing their degrees
and teaching a course, This year we
have Mia Tuan teaching a course on
race and ethnicity; last year Camille
Zubrinsky taught “Race in Amen.
ca." These women come from a
highly regatdedsociologv programat
UCLA to spend a year sharing their
knowledge with us. Wow.)

Alongsimilar lines. the sociolo<
gy department also sponsors the
MOSTprogrnmforminoritystudenls
to spend their summer doing gradu—
ate level work at other universities.
When they return in the fall. they
reporton the research they did, offer—
ing the rest of us insight into the
possibilities after Grinnell.

The sociology department has
also received a Hewlett grant. which
enabled the department to take six

students (not all from the sociology
department) to England to study so.
cialservice policyandpractice. This
is yet another example or how the
sociology department offers unique
opportunities to majors and other
students.

The sociology department also
accepts internships as part of the
major, which allow for hands<on
learning, workplace experience and
socialservice. Allofthese are impor.
tant aspects of a liberal arts edtica»
tion.

One more positive aspect orthe
sociology department is the profESr
sors themselves. They are friendly,
open. and always helpful. They e><«
hibit a genuine concern for all Stu.
dents, oftengoing outottheirway to

tions, and the meaning of his. our
professors also involve students in
their scholarly wort. These are
unique opportunities.

The department does lack in

there are only three rull.tuue profes—

administration and the academic
community to realize that we need,
at the very least, another faculty

ability to adapt quickly to a dynamic
field and a diverse student body. We
ask for the campus community‘s sup—
port in our time ofgrowth.

Campus Film Reviews
Dear Editor:

AsSOA films chair, I see a prob»
[cm with ihe way ihat the Scarlet &
Black has been handling the campus
film reviews laic ' The 5&5 is not
lit-ing up to its rtspoiisibility to re«
View films that the student’s activity
fees are spent on. lfthe 5&Bcritics
have not seen the film, why can't
they simply ask me for a synopsis of
the him instead of reviewing other
films or episodes of Melrose Place?
Films that are shown on campus cost
between 3150 [and] $500 each, and
students will not know what they are
about if the 5&8 refuses to review
them. The critics may believe that
they are in some way providing a
servicetothecoilegecommunirywith
their non—reVien's. but I believe that
this“service”comesarthe cost ofrhe
rest ofGrinnell students On a cam—
pus such as Grinnell that has to pro»
vitle its students with Virtually all of
their entertainment. such eyenis as

perience from them. It also bothers
me that yusr two weeks ago, the crit.
ics stated that they would no longer
rev ieiv moi/lies or televrsion shows in
place ofthe reviews otcampiis films,
but they did not live up to their
promise. lrake my job very seriously.
but obviously the critics do not feel
the same way about theirs.

 

lalsosawaprobleminlastweek's
review of the film Friday in which
one ofthe critics stated “I watched a
lialthourorthis movie And people
say I'm not multicultural.” I took
great offense at this statement. That
statement was irrelevant to the CHD
it's like or dislike of the movie, of
which he iiatcheti very little. To
mate the statement, humorously or
not, that watching 30 minutes of a
movie mates one multicultural only
slions how ignorant the person is
about issues of race. Such attitudes
cause the racial problems on this
campus To equate watching part of
a movie [with] being“multicultural"
is tremendously disrespeetrul to all
the students on this campus, regard.
less of color.

in the future. l would appreciate
it if the CHUCS would review the
movies that are showing on campus
and, regardlessotii hether they watch
the movie or not, would be profes—

commcnis about multiculturalism in
the editorial section. If the critics
reel they cannot do this, then per.
haps they should consider rinding
