as seeing the game itself. And that
is what C, Houghton Will, of Langan
Hall, has been doing with his radio
receiving set in the last few days. Re-
ports of every play, and every hapr
planing in the game go by telegraph;

to Kansas City. where they are im-‘
merliately brondcasted by the Kansas
City Star. ll‘r. Will reports that the‘
messages come in very clearly, al-
though the distance is over 200 miles.
The games begin at 3:00 o’clock, Newl
York time, but due to the two hours‘
difference in time, reports come in‘
about 1:00 and continue until about
3:00.

Mr. Will assembled his set from his
own plans, and constructed several oi

tubes. which gave strong signals, and
make a very satisfactory set. He will

next week, and anyone who wishesl
