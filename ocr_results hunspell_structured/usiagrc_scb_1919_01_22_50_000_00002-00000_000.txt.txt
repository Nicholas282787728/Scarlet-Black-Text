. .ilt‘lNG GRINXELL SPIRIT.

Those who feel and know Grillncll
Spirit realize that it is a growing ac-
cumulation of the deeds and thorrghts
of passing generations. They realize
that it is the reflection of the life of
those who have been apart ot the
institution. .

The reason that ‘Gi'innell Spirit is a
living force for the highest ideals of
college life today is the fact that in
the past men anri women of Gi-inncll
have seen high visions and sti-iveu
toward their realization

The important point for those who
are ioi-giug the present link in the
history of emotion is that Grinnell
Spirit, which represents the heart of
the college, is not a completed thing
and never will he. Every day of the
college year adds something and every
present student and faculty member
is playing a pa t in building it.

Men’s dormi ies have just been
completed which give Griuneli inert a
college home second to none. They
have been in operation only a year
which means that only a meagre start
has been made toward the working out
of a deﬁnite life for men. This is a
process in which a year is a small
uhl't. '

In the process of early growth and
development there is bound to he a
certain amount or friction. All are
striving-far the same end, the good of
Grinneil, but many differ as to the
means of attainment. A spirit of co-
operation and respect for the other felv
low's ideas will bring in the endrtne
harmony which is so much desired.

We are making Grinneil Spirit. Our
additions should equal the high stand-
ards of the past.

THE THIRD DEGREE.

The Grinnell brotherhood has three
degreesithe under-classman, the up»
pel‘vclassman and the alumnus.

Each higher degree entails an added
importanec and responsibility in the
life of Gririneil. The underclessmen
know nothing oi Grinnell ideals as 811*
bodied in that mystic something called
the Griuneli Spirit. Upperclassmcn
have absorbed enough or "the spirit"
to point the under-‘classmen to a proper
beginning. The Alumni alone can any
preeiatc the true signiﬁcance of Grill-
ncll Spirit. ,

It is the purpose of the Scarlet and
Black to hind the brotherhood of Grin»
nell students more closely together by
keeping each in touch with all.

The problem of accomplishing this
for the undergraduates is simple ow-
ing to their concentration The great
body of Alrrmni, however, are scattered
near and far and it is largely through
their cooperation that we can give
them the place which they deserve in
a publication by and for Grinneli stu-
dents.

To facilitate this matter an Alumni

editor has been appointed whose busi»
ire it will he to obtain news and
opinions of Alumni. The success of
1 work depends on the support
which members of the Alumni body 0L

WHAT IS IE R. 0. ’1‘. Oil

What is this R. o, T. c. that the cola
logos are being rt her! into? No. one
linonst There is a feeling that it is
to he something along the line of the
system in state universities before the
war. But no one is sure.

At the convention of the Association
of American Colleges held in Chicago
in short time ago, army oiticers, as
government representatives were pres-
ent, and were supposcd to uphold the
R, o. T. 0. plan. not, in the words of
'thc chicngo Daily News. ."They were
wholly unable to elucidate to the col-
lege presidents Just what was required
of ‘them. ' .

With the plans for the movement at
this stage would it not he wise for
Grilllloll to be slow about signing up
with _any such system?

It it were a system srich as the statc
unuei ' es 'c'nfnl‘cotl under the Mor-
i-ill not who would want it? The writer
was well acquainted with recruits in
the army, who although but a few
months out ot school at the state ruii-
ICIS , 8L Amos, were Very Ignorant
about even the most elementary things
to drill. and declared that military
training as given in their instruction
did not amount to much for the under
classman who was required to take it.

Grinncll talks or a voluntary syse
tent. Any man who attended Gi'lllnell
in the spring or 1917 knows how hard
it is to keep up pop and enthusiasm
for voluntary drill, even with a brand—
iiew war against a babyukilling kaiser
as inspiration. What would the sit—
uation be after ﬁve fat years of peace,
when in the cold winter time the tide
nriring eyes of the fair were trrrned
upon the basketball hero in scarlet.
rather than ripou chilly khaki clad
armory soldier?

"But," say the advocates of the sys-
t’em, "There will be men who will want
reserve commissions, and can obtain
them in this way." You can!’ train a
man to the commission standard with-
out somebody for him to drill. And
the size of the Grinnell company in a
voluntary system, in time of peace,
and in winter wont allow for much
battalion drill. Besides, the desire for
a five-year reserve commission is not
universal by any means if we can
judge by the way men r'esigned from
the training camps with but a few
weeks between them and a'reserve
commission, when they were given
the opportunity.

There is only one eontingencyunder
which it would be proﬁtable for Grin-
nell to have the R. o. T. c if this na-
tion should tie»un with m itarism, and
establish universal, compulsory, m i-
taiy training in time of peace; and it
by taking the R, 0. T. C. course a man
might carry on his college work Willie
out intel‘riiplionAthen and not until
then should squads right, [tribe-rear
march he made a part of Grinnell life.

From present indications it luck: as
though Gettys will start at center
against Nebraska. He is playing a fast
game at center and his height enables
him to get the tipoff. He has also an
accurate eye for short baskets, and in
practice has been one or the lenders in
the scoring column.
