Dole recognizes WWII veterans

av PATRICK CALDDWELL

After Iowa was the center ofelectoral politics last fall durr
ing the lead up to the caucus, Grinnell’s campus has seemed to
lack a certain glamour ofthe political Variety But onThursday,
the ﬂare of political glory returned to the College when former
Republican Senator and 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole
spoke in Herrick Chapel.

Dale's visit to campus, sponsored by the Rosenheld Program
in Public Affairs, International Relations, and Human Rights,
was part ofa weekrlong series of events celebrating World War
II veterans in honor of Veterans Day, although all other events
in the series took place offrcampus.

Dole’s speech on Thursday mixed both political humor and
veneratron for veterans. He spent the majority of the ﬁrst half
of his talk telling jokes, referencing material from the two has
mor books he has published and also making light of the Via—
gra commercials he has become known for since leaving oftrce.
“ 've been asked for samples,” he said. ”But I didn't bring any.“

While maintaining his sense of humor, the second half of
Dale’s speech focused on commending veterans. Dole recog-

nized the veterans in attendance and spoke highly ofthe World
War ll memorial in Washington DC, encouraging any vetct»
ans in the audience to make the trip to View it and to share their
war stories in the process

“At our age we can tell them all, they don't have to be true,
we just say whatever we want Dole said.

But whrle the event focused largely on older veterans, Dole
also spoke of the need to look after the care of the younger
veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Dole argued
for better medical care for the returning veterans, and that they
not only need to be compensated for lose ofwages due to wan
related injuries, but also for the loss of quality oflife.

Dole’s praise for the younger veterans went so far Khaki
referencing Tom Brokaw’s wellrknown declaration that the
World War II generation is the “Greatest Generation"7Dole
said, “I think the greatest generation is the young men in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and Korea, and [those currently serving] around
the world.”

Fitting the theme ofthe events for the week, Dole’s speech
was well attended by students and members of the commur

Hospitalization over
alcohol on the rise

EVJr FRANC Busr:

This past weekend, two Grinncll College students were
hospitalized due to suspected alcohol poisoning. bringing the
total number of alcohol-related hospitalizations to 11 since
the beginning of the semester. Ofthosc hospitalized, five were
first-years and six were returning students According to data
from Student Affairs, at this point in time last semester, only
four students had been hosprtalizcd.

“We've had more people drrnk to the point that they’re
unconscious,m said Dean of Students Travis Greene. “We’re
concerned with the level ofexccss,"

When an RLC or Security Officer is with a student who
they think needs medical attention and the student is not in
immediate danger, often they will drive the student to the hos
pital,

In extreme instances, according to Greene, when the stat
dent is neither conscious nor responsive, College ofﬁcials will
call an ambulance to provide immediate care. "We don’t want

n RLC driving [unconcious] people in their car or making
a judgment on whether they need to go to the hospital,” said
Grecller"\7\/c’re not medical professionals.”

out of the 11 students hospitalized this year, eight were
transported by ambulance,
Last year all four students
taken to the hospital were
transported by a security oft
ficer or a friend,

Director of Security
Stephen Briscoe said that
there have been "no poliey
changes" from years past on when to call an ambulance.

Typically, an RLC or student staff member is the ﬁrst per-
son to evaluate and administer help to an intoxicated smdent.
lfthe situation is deemed severe, security is often summoned to
give assistance and call an ambulance rfnecessary.
