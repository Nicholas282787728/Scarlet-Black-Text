yesterday. it has ilot yet been de-
cided when the contest will be played,
but It is hoped that the two teams nim-
meet some time next week.

The Aggies are going to tur 'sli

perioriuauce last week.’ when they let
,lilssouri down without, a. run, but]
the boys say they ire going to cele-
bi-ute Coach Flsliel s new appointment
by winning all the rest of the games
on the schedule.

Rice's injury, suffered in practice
last week, will cause a severe shakeup
in the work of the team. The man to

McCullough ﬁlls the bill in every re-
spect, except tor ii noticeable uncer-
tainty in handling Andys “stuff.”
Frey has been out for prac ice during
Ihc past. few days and handles the,
hull well, but has a lalal weakness
in throwing to bases, owing to an in.
llii'ed arm. -

Fisher hi intimated his intention
or ti ilig Furwcll behind the but. but
this would leave him confronted with
the diiticulty of ﬁlling Jim's place in
the held. Fai'ii'cll's good “wing", and,
some previous experience with mesh!
and mitt. serve to ﬁt him excelleiltl
for the job. There is little probabil y
that Rice will be able to return to
work, as he has been on crutches since
his injury.
