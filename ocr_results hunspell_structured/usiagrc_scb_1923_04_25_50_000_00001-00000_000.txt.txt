College Undergraduates
0f the World,

In his ﬁrst chapel lecture on the‘
Contribution oi Greece to Modern‘
Thought,,,Dr. Slocum, ear-president of
Colorado College, started the discus-
sion with the question, ”What can
Greek induence do for us in these
hectic times?"

“Greece before the time Ci! Christ-
ianity' had the best in language,
drama, philosophy, music, politics,
and economics. There is some great
truth here, Which we need to lay hold
on," declared Dr. Slocum. He, then,
illustrated his point by quoting, 4'1
discover laws and [nrccs of nature
and fasten the world‘s machinery to
them. I am not an inventor, ” which
is the famous utterance 0! Thomas
Edison. This is Wllzlt the Greeks did.
they were out to discover the laws
and forces of nature.

Building Four decisively defeated
‘the horsebide artists iiom Smith Hall
yesterday by the lopsided score of 11
Ito 0. The ineffectiveness of Smith
Hall was due largely to errors, us
was shown by the fact that Building
Four only obtained ﬁve bits which is
suited in 11 runs. ,

The feature of the game was the
battery work of Building Four, Wyatt
hurling a good game with Moore res
celving. Wyatt secured ten strikec
outs in, ﬁve innings, holding the
Smith nine so closely that not a man
reached third base. Four did their
heavy base running work in the four-
th inning whcn five men safely cross-
home plate

Smith l-lali received only one safe
hit, but was unable to make it count
for much because of the tight play-
ing of their opponent's inﬁeld. Kai»
ar secured ﬁve strikeouts and An-
rlrews two in the contest.

The game scheduled ior Monday,
between Building Three and Dibble

condition of the diamond. Batteries:
