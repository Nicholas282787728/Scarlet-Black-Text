Many Orders To “Button”
Received by Young

Grinnellians

Without pomp or ceremony, Crin-
Dell's class of 1336 received its quota

lof scarlet and black prep caps Mon—

day evening. That is, the male mem-
bers of the class received them.

Maybe the reason that the fresh-
man women don‘t wear them is be—
cause they live in freshman cottages
and can thus be distinguished from
upper classmen. The men are scatter-
ed throughout the dormitories and
there is no other way of telling them
apart from the upper classineu ex-
cept that the latter study less and
bemoan the fact that most prepping
is a thing of the past.

Although the caps are shaped a bit
differently this year, the same in-

Pass Ogense
Helps to Win
Second Battle

Entire Pioneer Squad Used
By Coach Watt To Down
Cornell Attack

By MAX'ROSS

Playing like the Grinnell teams of
old, the 1932 edition of Coach Lester
L. (Fuzz) Watts gridiron machine
flashed an unexpected offensive drive
Friday night and completely out-
played a much-feared Cornell college
clevcn to the tune of 21 to 6.

It was the inspirational running
and kicking of Dick Ullrich that en-
abled the Pioneers to demonstrate
their advantage over thcir rivals, as
the burly back time and again sent
the Crinnell team deep into Purple
territory with his drives off tackle
and his lengthy punts.

elm-k Opens Attack

It remained for a substitute Sopho-
more, by the name of Wesley Clark,
however, to unleash the dynamite in
the Grinnell attack. Taking the place
of James after Rose had intercepted
a Cornell pass on me visitors' 85-
yard line, Clark reeled off 10 yards
on a lateral pass play. After a 5-yard
gain by Ullric‘h, after which Coach
Dick Barker's men held, the cool
sophomore dropped back and calmly
tossed a perfect 19-yard pass into the
waiting hands of Pete McKee who
caught it neatly over the goal line
for the first touchdown. Ullricll's
kick was blocked.

Only a short time before Ullrich
had piloted from his own 15-yard line
65 yards to the Cornell 20~yard stripe.
Crosby returned the kick, booting the
ball to his own 42-yard line, Grinnell
could not gain, however, and Dumb
dropped back past midfield to kick.
His best effort came at this time, as
he placed the ball squarely in the
southwest corner of the field where
McKee downed it on the 1-wrd line.

This kick was responsible for the
first two points of the game as Cros-
by steppcd back of the cod zone be-
fore he kicked, giving Grinnell a safe-
ty.

loose Scores Touchdown

Ullrich was directly responsible for
the second Pioneer touchdown which
cam just after the second half
started. Taking the ball on his own
43-yard line, he rcccd 37 yards
through right tackle to the 20-yard
line. The score came when James
sent a 20~ydrd pass straight down the
middle to Rose who caught it on the
goal line] Ullrich kicked the extra
point from placement.

At the end of the third quarter,
Ullrich sent a long kick deep into
Cornell territory wherc Shzldle fum-
blcd on his 12-yard line, Anderson of
Grinncll recovering. With virtually
an entire reserve team on tho field.
the Pioneers scored their final touch-
down at the start of the last quarter.
Ullrich raced 11 yards around left
end, but was tackled before he cross-
ed the goal line, Alexander skirted
right cud to the other side of the
field, but could not gain, which then
plunged through right guard for the
touchdown.

Wait Uses Full Squad

Substituting- frecly, Couch Watt
used every available man in the last
quarter. Late in thc period Cornell
Worked the ball’into scoring position,
when Shadlc grabbed a pass out of
the air after it had bounced off sev-
eral men and carried it to the 1-yard
line. He plunged through two plays
later for the marker.

Cor-null out-gained. out-passcd, and
made more first downs than the
Grinncll eleven, but only threatened
once. That attempt came after the
second Grinnell touchdown, but a
fighting Pioneer line thwarted the
Purple offense on the 5-yarcl liuc.
