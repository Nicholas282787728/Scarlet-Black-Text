Tracior Takes Dip
As Pond Ice Fails

A large tractor being used to
clear the country club lake for
skating hit a soft spot and went
through the ice last Saturday
afternoon. Although the ma-
chine was completely submerge
ed, the operator managed to es-
cape uninjured.

A wrecking crew worked
with buildings and grounds
employees for nearly three hours
to remove the tractor from the
north endof the lake. Norman
w. Marble (superintendent of
buildings and grounds), said
that the tractor would have to
be sent to Des Moines for re-
pairs, and that he had no idea
what the cost would he.

The clearing of the lake will
be completed with a smaller
tractol: The lake shouldhe ready
for skating in the near future.

McKinnell, ' a history mas
jol'. has been pastor of the
Chester Congregational church,
seven miles north of Grinnell,
since September. 1955, He plans
to enter Eden Theological semin-
ary at Webster Groves, Mo., this
fall.

A pastor of a rural church
with an active membership oi
65, he devotes from 20 to 24
hours a week to his ministerial

\ dutiesi/ These include Sunday

services, work with the youth
group and choir and parish
visitation.

He feels that being a college
student, much younger than
many of the members of his con-
gregation, does not 'affect .his
standing as a minister. He finds
his youth an advantage in coun-
seling the young people of his
parish, for he is close to their
problems and can communicate
with them easily.

Raised on a farm near Wal-
worth, Wist. he feels quite at
home in a rural parish and
often works in the fields with
his parishioners during the
summer to get to know them
betteri After finishing his work
at the seminaryr he hopes to
do missionary work in Latin
America, since this too is a
field of rural work,

His chapel service will the the
last in a series of three ‘devo-
tional periods led by students
and centered on the ideas of

faith. hope and love, respective-

League Board
cont. from p, l

\
votes in League Board elec-

tions should count 1/2 rather
than 2/3 as it has been in the
past. Reasons for this change
would he that freshmen don't
know the eligible junior women
well enough, especially juniors
in upper~class balls; that their
class is much larger than other
classes and therefore influen-
cial in elections; and- that they
don’t understand the workings
of women's government. Lack of _
interest could be verified by the
fact that less than six freshmen
women were present,at this
meeting.

An idea dealing directly
with the election suggested
that the junior won-uninterest-
ed in running for League
Board would check with the
office of the Dean of Women,
The need for more discussion
about elections with the jun-
ior women produced sugges-
tions‘for improvement in new
and differentyways for fresh-
men and transfers to become
acquainted with the junior
women A meeting of junior
women will he held next
semester to discuss League
Board and its workings.

The possibility of integrating
women’s halls brought a pro
and con’ discussion. Some wo-
men believed a new cottage
system which would mix Veshe
men and uppercless wom n in
every hall would be better than
the present system It was sug-
gested that a committee for
studying women’s housing be
formed to gather information
and look into the details on this
subject. The women are limited
in action taken on the subject
for the ultimate decision lies
with the administration.

Another meeting will be held
