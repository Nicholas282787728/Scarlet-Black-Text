his letter in the last meet in which
he will probably participate while

‘as too little. It is the same way with

this type of conversation. Then there,

is amusing tal —\ ltty conversation
that often sacridces everything for
the sake of cleverness. Another type
is the empty talk of the conventional
kindhthe type where the only essen.
lial is a ﬁxed Smile and constantly
moving lips. Yet another variety is
the political “handshnking” which
puts one to sleep. We owe it to our-
selves to see that no politician gets
by with this, that type of mum is unﬁt
to govern. Lastly, there is the use-
‘ful, stimulating talk which is not Ilene
‘cssarily dry or deep but is like the
artistiit plays along the surface for
a time find then dips into real things.”

In concluding, Miss Lowden made
a plea that we all take time to think.
“The real ‘type of Grinnell spirit,"
she declared, “is not the emotional
type such as that which prevails at
an athletic contest, but the
which comes thru achievementﬁin
intellectual type. The best Gl'innel-
lien is he who comes back in ten
years with the light of service in his
eyes and the imprint of clean cut liv-
ing on his face."

Taylor will also do both jumps,- pro-

Harvard Exchange Lecturer to
Conclude Series With His
Most Familiar Subject.

POLAND IMPORTANT STATE

Lack ofNatuml Boundaries Makes
Boundary Determination
Very Difficult.

The first of two lectures on "Po-
land," to conclude the series of
‘Hfu'vlil'd exchange lectures, on “New
States of central Europe,” was giv—
en in Herrick chapel Thursday by
Professor Robert H. Lord. In the
opinion of the lecturer, Poland is
one or the most important states
in Europe to-dey. It is situated in
Ithc geographical center of Europe
with no natural boundaries, a fact
‘whlch made the determination of
the boundaries of the new state a.
difficult matter.

Professor Lord developed in some
detail the bistoly of Poland from
the twelfth century when it united
‘with Lithuania, through the parti-
‘tiun of the country by Prussia. and
Austria, and Russia in 1774, 1793
and ’95, and up to the time of the
Peace Conference Where it was
made a separate state at the insist»
once of France. The questions of
the territorial problem and that of
nationalism were explained by the
speaker, who believes that justice
was done Poland and that she did
not obtain more territory than she
deserved through the Versailles
treaty. Professor Lord also ex-
plained the Danzig question and the
nature of the division of upper Sl-
lesia in which territory rich in nat—
‘urnl resources was turned over to
Poland rather than Germany.

In concluding his lecture the
speaker declared that the three mil-
lion Germztn subjects and the 19,-
000 suudre_miles of German ter-
ritory which were handed over to
Poland will very likely be a source
of friction between the two coun<
tries for some time to come.

'Instiute's negative team, Gordon

posed of Roger Patton, John Norris,
‘and Leon Jones. The winning of these
two debates gave Institute the cham—
picnship for the series.

Iohicn and Forum each won one
debate. The Ionian affirmative team
of Clark Rogers, Iobh McGee, and
Dirk Iieezen were victorious over the
‘Chl'esto team made up of DeArv Ea —
