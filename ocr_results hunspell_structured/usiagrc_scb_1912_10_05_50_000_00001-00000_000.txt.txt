The ﬁrst number was one ot Carl
Maria von Weber's overtures, namely,
“Oberon?" This, and the scenes [mm
“The Valkyrie” by Wagner; shared the
position ot ﬁrst place in the apprcci.
tion oi nearly all present. The mag
iiilicent, dignilied parts were especir
ally well given, and the delicate, more
shaded harmonizations were interpret»
ed very well indeed for a hand,

The “Reverie" by Leybach was pleas-
ing, but seemed very commonplace in
contrast to the overture preceding it.
The eupllonillm solo, “Josephine",
given by George 0th Frey, was greatly
appreciated, and called iorth two en-
cores. The enphonium is not a coin
mon instrument, and its mellow, sus-
tained tone displayed its value very
clearly.
