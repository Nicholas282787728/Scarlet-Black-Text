A half-mile ofswirnniing. 13 miles ofhilts
ing. And a three-mile run. Sound like fun2 15
Ctinnell students certainly think so

For the third year, the Physical Educa 'on
Department is running a triathlon training
course for students of all athletic backgrounds
to improve the skills needed to compete in a
triathlon. Students create personal training
plans with Head swinr Coach Erin Hurley, rhc
current instrrretor, to develop their swimming,
hiking and running proﬁciency and eventually
take part in a nunrstriarhlon, which the class
hosts at the end of the semester.

Hurley said that sit ts inception, the
class has grown consrderahly rn popularitv I
initially only wanted to have twelve students
in the cor but it now has fifteen, with ﬁve
on the wa *ng list," she said.

One reason for the popularity nfthe course
has heen the diversity of the participants
athleticism. which was made effective by the
method of instruction. “[Hurlcy] did a great
job of making the class accessible to people

with lors of ditterenr levels of experience and
knowing the different types training that they
entail,”sard Hugh Redford '10, who is enrolled
in the course.

Regardless of prior athletic background,
Hurley expects that all her students will be
well prepared to eornpete at the end of the
seinestc . “The class is really representative of
what a triathlon rs,"sard Hurley. Hurley herself
trained for a triathlon in college, relying on her
swimming background and supplementing her
experience by hiking in a group and running
with a high school cross country tcarn,

The cla is structured to study both the
theory and l ‘to behind the triathlon, and to
train eti’ecrively ,ing programs speciﬁc to rhe
athletic ability of each student. The first two
weeks of the class focused on the mechanics
of the triathlon, with students using the text
“erWeel; Triathlon” to develop their training
program The class meets for two hours each
week, during which students have the choice
ofswirrrrning, biking, running on the treadmill,
or worlring our on the elliptical nraehrne Each

student keeps a training log recording their
workout each day, and is expected to supple
merit their training outside of cla as well

The course hogan during the sprrng 2006
semester and was taught br former Assistant
Swim Coach Alex Kuhn Kuhn and Hurley
rnrtrally developed the class as an alternative
to the Conditioning and Core Swimming
courses, basing the curriculum on their own
experience as coaches and emphasizing a di-
verse tt‘ lg program.

their individual ahiliry rrnctrhc goal rhar they
wish to achieve. “\thn I graduate, I want to
do triatlllons as my athletic ncriviry and so I

triathlons already and has been swimming.
biking and running compctrtively for quite a
nurnher otyears. Ahlherg is more focused on
the minute details of the triathlon.

Atrrrya l<inr ’10,who plays intramural race

quetbllll but-ls not involved in varsity sports
agrees We could expect ourselves to rmprovc
h? 10% every week. said Kim And rhar also
depends on what kind of athlete you are and
what you nccd, how much experience you have
and how much you train, sriclr to rhe schedule,
and it's a very personal thing,"

While many people in the class simply
wanr to rrrrish the sprint triathlon at the end of
rho semester, others wish to use this as erred
rive cross-training for further athletic actlv'r
ties. Anne Eaton ‘08 is training for a marathon
at the same time, and Andr v Kishman 10
pirted up svvinrnrrng and biking over last year
and now plans to cornpcte in a ha onrnan

No matter what their bil es arcthc peo-
ple in the class were all Hi r nous in their rec»
omrnendarion of this class ro almosr anyone,
from hatdcncd arhleros to people who have
not gone for a run in years, As I-lnrley said,
the different levels and areas ofathleticism will
allow for students to learn from one another:
“One persons strength could he another's
weakness."
