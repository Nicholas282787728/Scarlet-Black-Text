. Many years ago I asked my mother
, who God was. She explained,

“He’s like the President, only more

important.”

Just recently, along with my other
paranoias, I heard two people speak of
me. One asked the other who the

, “Davidic Messiah” was, The other,
'being of the more knowledgeable type,
stated quite frankly, “This guy is like
the other Messiah, only less. . . ”

At this point I was seen and the en-
tire conversation ceased (not without
a red face or two).

Unfortunately, I do not think they
understand the role of SGA president,
and the rest of that ilk, any more than
most students. Looking at the way
campaigns are runemine included—
it is easy to see why there are
misunderstandings.

There are two basic factions on
campus: those who think that SGA
needs to be exceedingly verbal with
the administration, and, conversely.
those who believe SGA functions only
superficially to show “hardcores”
how to be politicians. Both groups are
misguided by lack of proper iniorma-
tion, or inclination.

Secrets of Grinnell

Grinnell, Iowa is the last place one
would look for a military-industrial
complex, much less Grinnell College,
noted for its left-of-centre views. But,
this complex is precisely what exists
on this campus.

I realize the severity oi my allega-
tions, but the evidence is so over
whelming that my sense of civic duty
will not allow me to withhold mis in-
formation any longer. l iully realize
the national security implications of
this article, but I would rather ex-
perience a domestic furor than a SS-ld
hurtling down upon me. My motives
are purely unseliish. On to an ex-
amination of the evidence.

To begin with, there is a missile on
this campus. The missile is a
Minuteman 111, located under the
Zirkle Monument. More specifically,
the silo that houses the missile is
located there, the missile is located
many feet below the ground, The
monument is at the center of the silo
covering and is, in fact, a
sophisticated piece of radar equip-
ment.

Look at the Zirkle more closely the
next time you are out there; the nor-
thwest side or the top is beveled, If so-
meone were to draw an arc from the
Zirkle in a northwesterly direction
over the North Pole, he would find
himself in the U.S.S.R., in the vicinity
of several large Soviet cities.

SGA

tive tool in decisions concerning the
student body,

Over the years, such things as coed
and “dialra-john” bathrooms, the
defeat of the "F" grade, EPCS, stu-
dent »faculty -administration commit-
tees (such as the Committee on Stu-
dent Life, Where students are the ma
jority), and policies which we all now
take for granted, were student»
organized. Let us not iorget about Skip
Day, either.

SGA is accessable to all interested
students. 1 am especially concerned
about your opinions on all Issues. Thls
is not easy to obtain these days, in the
midst of the “me" generation, where
attitudes oi apathy and atrophy are
greatest.

There are many times that school
work and partying, not necessarily in
that order, take up the larger part of
the “Grinnell Experience.” There is
also the notion that getting politically
involved takes up too much free time,

These feelings are substantiated if
you are SGA treasurer (that's Jefi
Cronin, by the way). but not as a
member oi, say. the housing commit
tee or an EPC.

If this does seem too taxing, at least
bring your ID. to the post oiiice when

underground

open space/david kranler

elections or reierendums are being
held. It takes less than ten minutes
and hurts less than a shot at a doctor’s
office,

Information, vocalization, conversar
tion, imagination, and illumination art
all attributes oi student government.
If you need something, we are here to
help,

[have to go now to my weekly sabe
bath meeting with God, so 1 will have
to cut this short, Just make an at-
tempt at finding out what is taking
place concerning the students. With
that, I give you my blessing. Amen.

Furthermore. the area aound the david motile~

Zirkle is devoid of any trees, The
Closest tree is 41 feet from the monu-
ment, which means there are no trees
within a circle with a diameter of 82
feet, sufficient clearance for a
Minuteman III to launch.

Also notice that there is no Concrete
path leading from the ARE/Post 0i-
iice courtyard directly to the Science
Building. All concrete paths circum-
vent this tree-less area,

Returning students will remember
the trees planted around this area last
year, complete with little, hollow,
steel pipes which appeared to be tor
the tree’s Support. This is not so.
Those little pipes are part oi an in-
tricate system to provide air to the
underground control center.

Note, also, that near the largest tree
west of the Zirkle. there is a manhole
in the grass. Why is there a manhole
in the middle of a field? This leads us
to further revelations. We always hear
about the system oi underground tun-
nels that crisscross the campus, but
no one has ever seen them. Well, they
do exist, but not [or those of us
without security clearance,

l have learned, from reliable sources,
that the real reason for alt-President
Turner‘s resignation was that he knew
too much and was forced out by the

Government.
There are indications that Turner

told ViceeProvost Ken Browning and
Director of Of{»CampuS Studies, Roger
Koester, what he knew, and the pre
sent administrative shake-up is to
silence these two men, President
Drake responded to all oi my ques-
lions with a “No comment.” Is our
president the innocent Bachelor of
Divmity he claims he is?

The huge tree branches lying all
over campus were in the way of the
trajectory pattern oi the missile.
Those branches did not just “fall” off
the trees. I have also learned that the
operations center lor the missile
needed to be enlarged. The easiest
direction ior expansion was under
Mears Cottage. The problem was that
there were students living in the dorm
and they would be sure to hear the
