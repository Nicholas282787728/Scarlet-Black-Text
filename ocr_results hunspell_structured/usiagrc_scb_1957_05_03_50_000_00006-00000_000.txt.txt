placed second in the «ti—yd.

ees were particularly outstand—
ing as lnr as limes, heights or
distances are concerned, but
the winning of two dual meets
in quick succession indicates
that the squad is improving
in attitude ilnd condition in
prepnratioii tor the Midwest
conierenee meet at Monmouth
on May is.

The lnldrweek meet at Goa
will be coming a tow days prior
to the only home meet 'on the
Pioneer schedule this year and
should be a good u-“rm-up 'for
the later meet against Iowa
State Teachers.

Last fall (hiring the “prep:
ping season” Grinnell's nin ,
hole golf course—the only.
golf course within miles of
here—again came oil't‘i thei
sllo test end of the various
activities.

The $200 Irv Simone rounded
up .to help pay for damages
might have been well spent
elsewhere 7 and he got away

To some of us who might be
accustomed to plush country
clubs Grinnell’s little “Bride
and joy” may seem n pool-r
substitute. But the people Of
this community have devoted

n grent deal at time and
money to its development.

‘ Because of their gi-aciousness
land sense oi fair plav Pioneer
‘cl‘oss-counlrv and golf tennis
,liave been able to use the club.
,As a_lhank~yml we leave them
lbeel‘ cans and rubbish in e.\‘-
lchzlnge for their pins and tee
linar- rs. It doesn't add up.

It's been said that when one
is mature enough to go to
college he is possessed with
good judgement. stealing pins_
and toe markers and the (lig-
ging up of greens is a far
cry from using such judgment,
I think we'll all agree,
Because the warm weather is
here n number of Clul) incin-
hers have iclt it necessary to ap-

‘proach Mr. siinone in hopes oi
curbing thc horde of distruct-
iulness that is lniliclcd year
after year.

rd he the last to condemn
blanket parties, hecr busts, or
picnics (Grinnell needs more
oi em. But let's act our ages
in keeping empty- beer cans
and other garbage pi‘t the golf
course.
