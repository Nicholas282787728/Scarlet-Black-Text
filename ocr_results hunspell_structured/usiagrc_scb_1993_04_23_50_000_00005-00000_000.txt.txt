Uncertainty reduces hope for “codified Genitaiiy

by Barry Gilbet

0 begin wnii, Berlin is an
ugly city. All people talk
about these tltiys it seem are

the Television Tower and the Palace
of the Republic (two Sinners against
the city‘s fair complextion) and
whether or not to tear them down.

The lattcrwas formerly the Ger-
man Democratic Republic’s House
of Parliament, a reflective glassrber
decked shopping inall squatting opr
postte the Berliner Cathedral. Tlte
former, the Femre/itltmt, is :t 1300-
foot high concrete bettnpolc with ti
round observation post at the top
which bears an eerie resemblance to
tlte Death Star.

At night you can see it froin
miles away, blinking, lurking; tlte
Great East German Erection poking
at the sky. Opinion as to what to do
with them is,ofcoursc, varied. Some
favorturning ihePalace into a central
library; others point out tltat the
money itwouldcost topulldown the
Television Tower could be better
spent.

“Children need to be educated
and the unemployed supported."
Jacqueline said, hitting the steering
wheel for emphasis. Jacqueline is an
East Berliner, akindergarten teacher
who I am friends with. I asked what
she thought about the idea of taking
the Tower down.

“They don't have money to in-

'all telephones but they can find
money to knock a tower down," she
saut, Wt: were driving through the
center ol‘ East Berlin, and the Tower
iLsulfstoodclotirly in die foreground,
blinking, as always. “What it is, is
politics. The BDR wants to erase all
memory ofthe DDR, That is whitt lS
mostiinportttnt,u1ways,thepolitics.”

She makes a point tltat many
citi7ens of former East Germany
would more or less endorse: Though
the Wall is gone, many differences
between former residents ofEastantl
WesthrttiLuiy remain, festering like
a poorly tetttlcd wotintl, and which
the govcmiiicnt of Unified Germany
has yet to aeknowclodge.

“The Wall within our heads,” is
a phrase the Berlin press loves to
throw around, but like all elichés.
there is much truth in it. Ossis anti
Wessis are the vernacular terms as-
signed to those from the East and
West. and Berlin, due to its peculiar
history, is between the two groups,

The Ossis are pissed, as there are
over three million people currently
unemployed in Germany, the large
majority of whom live in the former
DDR. With the rise in unemployment
has also come a rise in the prices of
food, services and rent. Grounds
enough foranger, but what causes the
most resentment is the perceptions

“All right, the DDR was not the
most beautiful thing, but is the new
government any better? Sure, you
couldn't travel, but rent was free, the
beer was cheap, and the girls were
still pretty. Now we are supposed to
begrateful for ‘ lllieratiott’ioh thank

doesn’t work like that "

From the some form

both social and economic, may be far

However, the realities of every-
day life are often different than the
images created by the selective re-
ponage of the Westem media. Rac-
ism in Germany is actually very simi
lar to racism in the United States. It is
real, ever-present and intractable.
Thus, as the LA. riots were an atypi-

cally violent and dramatic explosion
of ever-present tensions, so have the
skinhead attacks been.

In some ways the Germans have
been Iai' more active in combatting
racism than Amer' ' tns. In Berlin at

tween skinheads and their opponents
(who never seem to receive any rer
portage), the young leftists. Not to
mention the Turks, the main victims
of racism here, who have formed
gangs of their own and go on
“skinhead hunts." This is, of course,
not a plemant solution to the situa-
tion, but it is evidence to the active
resistance to any sort of Nazi revival.

And as for the economic prob-
lems here, they are very real, but one
must be very careful when listening
to complaints. Those who pine the
loudest for the old DDR are usually
those who had something to lose:

rormer embassy employees or con
tractors who had “special relation
ships” with the govcmmcrlt.

The positive elements of the
retinificattonsarealsoevidcntinEast
Berlin. The subways, sewers and
streets are finally receiving desper-
ately needed renovations.

East Berlin is a wholly different
place than when I visited three years
ago. The energy which has always
characterized West Berlin has begun
to flow ittto these formerly sleepy
streets, bnngitig the flood ofWestem
goods and tnttss culture which both
pleases and overwhelms the East

stores are doing booming business,
cafes are springing up daily, and the
notorious Tmbis are being shoved
outofthe way by Audis, Toyotas and
the occasional Mercedes.

Certainly, the problems remain.
There aren’t enough apartments, the
unemployment rate is truly shocking

many former East Germans are find»
ing themselves less than viable in the
new market economy.

Things are uncenain here, but
Sony is building a new skyscraper in
the old Palrdwner Platz. People are
excited and hopeful. The Palace of
the republic remians for now in this
new era. along with fragments of the
Wall; and the Television Tower,
which stands watching over the city,
and waiting.
