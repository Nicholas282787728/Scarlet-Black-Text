Shaw Satire
in Be Given
by Dramal'isl's

“Androcles and Lion"
Presentation Set
for March 2, 3, 5

By John Marion
“Androcles and the Lion,"
George Bernard Shaw’s satire on
pseudo»Chl‘lsLlans will be present-
ed by the drama department on
the nights of March 2, 3 and 5 in
the Alumni Recitation hall audi-
toriuin.

The play depicts the howling
evangelist, hho is more of a fol-
lower of Mars than of .Christ; the
proud martyr who doesn't: under-
stand why he is a martyr, and the
hypocritical martyr who is counts
ing on martyrdom to get to heav-
en.

Through the Captain and La-
vinia, lovers in the play, Shaw
gives his own views on the true
meaning of Christianity.

The play is one of Shaw's most
hilarious and penetrating studies
of the foibles of the human race,
and is one of the most ambitious
projects the drama department
has ever attempted.

House Presidents
Approve Measures
for Identification

The Council of House Pl-e
dents Thursday night voted unan
iinoiisly in favor or fingerprints!
rug Grinnell students as a part of
a national campaign.

The action was taken by the
Council following receipt of a
letter from J. Edgar Hoover, (lie
rector of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, stating that there
are now on file more than 500,000
prints of private individuals on
tile in the bureau.

The proposal will be submitted
to the men in house meetings
Monday evening, according to
Dwight Porter, president of the
Council

Fingerprinting of this type,
Porter pointed out, is of value as
a means of identification in case
of accident or death and provides
added protection against loss of
property.

Porter said that the civil fin-
gerprint file is separate from the
criminal file, and that the move
is being sponsored elsewhere by
civic organizations.

The fingerprints, according to
present plans, would be filed in
Washington at no cost to the in-
dividual.

Rawson Hostess Returns
Tomorrow after Illness

Mrs. W. H. Blake, hostess in
Rawson hall, who has been on a

because of illness, will return to-
morrow, according to Sheton L,
Beatty, dean of men.

Mrs H. J. Ferguson, who has
been taking Mrs. Blake's place,
will return to her home in Tama
today.

“European Situation Depressing,

Speaker Unworried l -

by Conditions in

“The situation in Europe today,
is depressing but not immediate-
ly alarming," according to Dr.l
Walter M. Kotschnig, of Geneva,
Switzerland and Northampton,
Mass.

"I do not feel that there is
cause for great worry in either
Spain or in China,” Kotschnig,
who arrived Wednesday to begin
a month of lectures and classes
on international relations. contin-
ued.

Spain will probably just wear
herself out, and in the end we
will find two separate govern—

 

ments there, Kotschnig declared.

And as for China, no matter
now much of China the Japa-
nese conquer, there will be mil-

lions of Chinese unettected in any -»

way.

The most serious situation at
present is the relation between
Austria and Germany and the
relation of these two countries to
the rest of the world. “For the
present Austria will probably re-
main independent in name but ner
government will take orders from
Berlin," he said.

“In my lectures here I shall
try to point out the national
characteristics which have made
possible the present situation in
Europe and from these draw a
conclusion on the steps we musty
take to keep the situation from
becoming more serious," Kotsch-

Ask Action
on Cu+ Plan

Student Council
Votes Request
for Revision

In a letter sent to the curri-
culum committee of the college
today, the student Council unam—
mously recommended that some
action be talren on the revision of
the absence and cut system now
in force.

Pointing out that such action
was proposed several months ago
and that as yet no move has
been taken, the council reiterated
its contention that the “present
cut system is inefficient. impracth
cal and unjust.”

This conclusion is based on the
fact that students are penalized
in the classroom for each class
missed and in the registrar's office
for exceeding the arbitrary total
absence limitation, the council
said.

Citing a statement of Pres.
Robert M, Hutchihs of the Uni-
versity of Chicago in regard to
the Chicago plan of unlimited cuts
to the effect that “college stu-
dents do not want to be treated
either as infants or delinquents
we have previously under-
estimated both their intelligence
and their initiative. .they attend
classes as regularly as when class
attendance was compulsory.” The
council expressed the belief that
“the claibre of Grinnell students
is equal to that of the students
of the University of Chicago."
