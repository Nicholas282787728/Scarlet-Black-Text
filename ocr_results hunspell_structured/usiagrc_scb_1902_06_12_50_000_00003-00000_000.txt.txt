story on “Who Was Successful," in
which two types of Scholars were pore
trayed. one a narrow-minded bookr
worm, the other a live, progressive,
man, keeping iir close touch with his
age. This production was interesting
because of the illness of its subject to
the occasion.

Andrew Mciratlr then read the
class poem, iii which ire related the
achievements of his classmates arid‘
the things tirey hope to accomplish,
much to the disparagement or the
Freshman and Sophomore classes

The recitation of Tennyson's Ree

a manner that did ftrli justice to the
spirit of the poem.

HYDE PRIZE CONTEST,

Not the least interesting program
of a week fiiii of social entertain»
merits was given Saturday afternoon,
in the Stone church when three Fresh-
men and three Sophomores entered
the Oratorical contest for the Hyde
prizes. Itisa lamentable fact that
no Jriiiiors appeared to corripete, but
the absence of 1903 representatives
was allowed for partially at least by
the added interest in the numbers that
were given.

The Freshman portion of the prize
went to H. D. Hirtchins whose Silh'
ject was “The Higher Patriotism,”
aird T. S. Rissei took the honors for
the Sophomores with an oration on
“The Injustice of Lynching.“

The Freshmen speakers, C. L,
Faiitjuier, n. D. Hutchins and w, D.
Paul were presented in order named
by Pres. Bradley immediately after
the invocation by Rev, Robinson, of

the Baptist church and an explana-i

tion of the Hyde Prize system by
Prof. Noble, All the productions were
well rendered and well received.

At the close of the Freshman con»

test, Miss Clarke rendered a pleasing!

vocal selection. Mr. M. M. Qiiaite
was the tirst of the Sophomores to
speak, “The Negro industrially Cone
sidered,” was his theme. Mr. Leye
enherger followed with an oration on
”The Spirit of Expansion." T, s.
Risser was last to speak and he suce

lceeded in portraying the injustice of

lynching in a tnantier tliat won the
prize,

At the close of Mr. Risser's oration
the judges retired, leaving the audi-
ence iii nitrcir doubt as to the winners
of both contests, but the long - mo-
ments of suspense before Prof. Noble

could announce the verdict were made
short by another solo from Miss
Clarke. The judges tor the Freshmen
\\ Miss Chainberiarn, '92, C. F
Ha s, '96, and R. M, Haiiies, J ,
93, and for the Sophomores Mrs. W.
H, Newman, Rev T. O Douglass,
Jr., and D. A. Thornbttrg. Mr.
Risser received tifteeir dollars for the
Sophomore share of the prize and Mr.
HtltCilil‘lS ten for the Freshmen por-
tloii. The Junior prize, for which
there were no contestants, would have
been twenty-ﬁve, and this amount is
,irdderi to the general endowment of
the Hyde prize.-

HILL PRizE CONTEST,

The lttlr annual contest for the Hill
Prize iti extemporaneons speaking and
sight singing was held before a large

church Monday morning.

After the invocation by Dr. J. L
“Hill, of Salem, Mass, Miss Marie
Boirsqtiet opened the program by singe
iiig Cowen's “The Better Land,“ iii a
tnost pleasirigntanner. Miss Bousqriet
sang very independently of her notes
and so was able to use her naturally
sweet alto voice to the best advantage.
The etl'ect of the number was marred
by the usual interruptions, caused by
people coming in late.

The second rruntber on the program
was an address by Mr. E. F, Derrisorr
of the Chrestomathian Society, on the
subject, “Social Service as a Profese
sron." Tire speaker made a strong
plea for life servrce along social litres,
as an active profession, but at the
same time recognized that to be most
ettective social work must be universe
alized, in child \i0ik, social settle-
nrerrt work, iii municipal reform aitd
in work among the inmates of state
institutions is a great tield for those
possessing tact, health and the social
spirit. Mr. Denison spoke very efiSl'
iy and distinctly without hesitation,
showing the result of previous training
in public speaking.

Beloved," set to music by Protheroe.
The audience was perhaps more far
miliar with this than with ally of the
other selections. Miss Findlay emin-
ciated very distinctly, but at times had
difﬁculty iir keeping on the key.
l The next speaker was Miss Cynthia
D. Meyer of the Caiocagathian Socie-
ty. Miss Meyer had as her subject,
“Organized Religious Work in Col-
lege," on which she spoke ﬂuently arid
interestingly, Religious organizations
should be one of the strongest features
of college life, for it has value as me
chanicai work in training executive
ability and developing tact and syme
lpatlry. Organized religious societies
are valuable in rendering aid to new
students, and through tlretn much good
is done outside college walls, such as
iir settlement work, which otherwise
would not be accomplished.

For the next selection Miss Flor-

 

sized audience iii the Congregationalr

,The sweet quality of

Following this Miss Mae Findlay,
sang Longfellow’s poem, ”Good Night'

 

ence Anger sang Ronald's “Love’s
Request.” Miss Anger possesses a
sweet soprano vorce but was inclined
to shaip her high notes occasionally.
'his was undoubtedly the most dirti-
cult of the musical selections.

Miss lriez Smith of the Ellis socie-
ty spoke next on “The Highest
Coot.” Treating the subject in a
scientiﬁc manner, Miss Sntitlr traced
the historical development of the con
ception of the highest good as found
in the two great schools, the Hed-
onrsts and the Errergists, closing ivlth
a Stlong plea for the service of Chris
lian brotherhood as the highest good.

Mr. Henry James of the lttstitute
Society delivered the best systernatiz-
ed speech on the subject, “Should
the Legalization and Control of Moir-
opolistic Corporations be Transferred
ttortr the States to the General Gov-
ernment.” Tire speaker argued
strongly for natiottai control and
urged legislation for publicrty and
government inspection of trusts.

Miss Bessie Ricker next sang “The
Sand Man is Coming,” by Sclrrieli.
the singer’s
vorce was hardly heard to advantage
iii the large auditorium and she seem-
ed less independent of her music than
the other singers.

After Miss Mabel Smith had spoke
en in air interesting and ready manner
on the life and work of Jacob A,
Riis, Mr. L. L. Harris of the Institute
Society closed the program by an ad-
dress oir "Plato’s Theory of State."
After discussing this as the earliest
cornrnunistic theory, the speaker cone
chided that Plato had failed iti over-
looking the individiraiity of man and
so had reduced man to a level with
the beasts. Mr. Harris spoke with
more deliberation than the other con~
testants btri seeriied hardly as easy on
the platform.

While iv rig for the decisions of
thejudges. Dr. James L. Hill, ’71,
one of the donors of the prize, spoke
in a characteristic way on the value
of training for public speaking,

The judges of speaking, Dr. S. .
Buck, ’88, Miss Belle Powers, ’91,
and Mr. L. C. Hodsorr, awarded the
lirst prize of 540 to E. F. Dennison,
the second prize of $20 to Miss Mey-
er aiid the third prize of 53 to Mr.
Harris.

Tire judges of singing, Miss Jessie
Str'ubie, Miss Nellie Clark, ’00, and
Mrs. S. J, Pooley, ‘97, awarded the
first prize of 520 to Miss Eonsquet
and the second prize of $10 to Miss
Anger,

Tire accompaniments were played
itr a most skiiitui manner by Miss
Helen May Thomson, S. of M. ’97.

PRDMENADE AND PIPE OF PEACE
OMITTED.

On accorrtit ofthe inclement weather
the Juniors and Seniors this year were _
obliged to forego the pleasure of srtiok-
ing the pipe of peace. Constant rain
prevented both these ceremonies and
the annual promenade and open air
glee ciirb concert.
