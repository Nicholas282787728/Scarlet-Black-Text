ON “LIT"

The following article, entitled "Lit,"
which appeared several weeks ago in The
Christian Science Monitor, expressed our
own feeling about certain phases of Ellglish
Literature so well that we decided to reprint
it verbatim.

Any comment we might make on the
article itself would be in the nature of an
anti-climax, but we would like to make it
clear that we are not offering it as a
criticism of the English department of this
or‘any,;0thel‘ schoolr ,We- are rather offer-
ing lt‘ as a commentary worthy of consider-a»
tion by faculty and students interested in
improving the present educational system.
,When read in this light the article furnishes
interesting ideas for the development of the
English “Lit” course.

WET. S

i Mr. Stephen Potter, a distinguished stu-
dent and critic of English literature, has in-
vented a new word. It' is a short one—Lit

which may be lengthened for certain pur-
poses into EngLLit, and becomes Lit-Ang
,when considered in reference to certain
studies pursued at an ancient university,
-Lit, to be brief, is the thing that English
literature becomes when it falls into the
hands of grammarians, pedagogues, writers
'of theses, itinerant lecturers, anccdotalists
“and collectors. It is the thing that arrives
when literature has ceased to be creative
and becomes respectable, fashionable and
creditable.
r Shakespeare becomes Lit when he is not
being acted on the stage or devoured in the
study, but has become a textbook to be
studied with notes and tears (but not tears
of passion). Sponsor is Lit when as the
_”poet's post" he is analyzed line by line and
his literary sources are pursued till they are
dry. Walt Whitman might become Lit in
the hands of a remorscless thesis writer,
and the time may come when the middle
westernness of Sinclair Lewis will be de—
scribed and classified ill the cliches of a
college classroom. r

Lit, in fact, is what remains of literature
.when inspiration has faded, the living in-
terest gone, and its dry bones have become
the subject of adulatory praise. It is the
t1' ute which lcaming pays to itself when
it seizes upon the masterpieces of a language
and makes them raw material. The process
‘of turning literature into Lit has been going
on for centuries, a sign of the homage which
civilized mediocrity pays to genius. When
the creative epoch of Greek tragic poetry
had exhausted itself, the rhetoricians and
'grammarians got to work on its body

[The Elizabethan dramatists wrote their
plays and thlillcd their audiences, but an~
other thing emerged before editors, annota—
tors and interpreters had finished with their
works. Professors of literature were ap-
pointed. Lit became a subject of university
study. It was taught, learnt, crammed, and
made the subject of examinations

Is not literature a sphere of knowledge?

Must it not be studied and made as hard as
possible so that professors may use their
learning and students reveal their industry?
But Mix Potter at least is one of those who
believe that in the teaching and study of it,
it need not be dehumanized. Its history
may be studied not as the history of dead
forms but as the history of vital sclf—cxpi'esr
sion. The writers of the pastieven in
schools and colleges—might be read and as-
similated ill just the same spirit as active
minds endeavor to put themselves ill contact
with the ideas of our own time, The past
and the present are forever interacting; and
in the true pursuit of literature the past
enters into and extends the horizon of the
present.

“IT TAKES LIFE”

In the current issue of The Tanager there
appears one of the finest discussions of
campus problems it has been our privilege
to see. The Scarlet and Black wishes to
offer sincere congratulations to the author
for his work, but we wish that he had had
the courage to sign the article. The Tana»
ger Board is to be congratulated for pubr
lishing this important contribution, It is
indeed encouraging to those of us who are
interested in making the most of our years
in college, to find our views expressed by a
person of ability and vision.

Doubtless the article will not be popular
with all it‘s readers, for it is a characteristic
of human nature to resent criticism, but we
hope that it will provoke discussion. Many
individuals will have valid criticisms, but if
they will read the article with an open mind
they will be forced to the conclusion that
there is more truth than fiction in the
authors description of conditions, and that
it applies to the great majority of students
in this and other institutions of higher
learning.

It is perhaps too much to expect that
definite action to correct the evils pointed
out in the article will be taken by any cam-
pus organization, but a great deal can, and
should, be done through individual action,
Certainly our own sense of integrity should
rebel against cheating the college and our-
selves, for we pay for the inefficiency of the
system, We are free within broad limits
to select the courses we will take, and many
members of the faculty offer thought pro-
voking courses. Each individual may refuse
to be a party to the various forms of van-
dalism common on the campus, and to a
large extent we determine the type of social
life we will have.

We willingly acknowledge the articles
criticism that our campus publications have
not always been all that they might, but we
do feel that there is ample- justification for
the small salaries paid the Managing Editor,
and the Business Manager of the Scarlet and
Black. If there are other offices on the
campus which entail as much work and re-
sponsibility they should carry a satisfactory
renumeration, but these men, working an
average of forty to fifty hours a week,
certainly earn the pay they get.

It is to be hoped that student organizar
tions will take their cue from this article,
and devote some of their energies toward
solving such of these problems as can best
be handled through group action. Be that
as it may, these problems can be solved if
we as individuals, determine now that we
will never again be in a position where we
may be accused of being unwilling to learn
to live.
