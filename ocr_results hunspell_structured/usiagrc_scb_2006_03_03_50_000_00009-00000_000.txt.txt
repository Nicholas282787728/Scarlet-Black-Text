SSE: What brought you to Grinneil?
Gebett: Grinncll has a central European presence

Todd Armstrong brings smr

dents [to Eastern Europe] and

once asked me to give a talk.

Some time later, Todd contacted

me and asked how] would like to

teach at Grinnell. And I seized

on the idea because I would fi-

nally have the opportunity to

ﬁnish all the books I started

writing. so Grinnell wanted me

and I was eager to come.

888: What did you know
about Grinnell before coming?

Gebert: I vaguely knew about it from the brief
information Todd gave me. ButI had never been to
Iowa before. My mindset ms this: I will teach and
have the rest of the time for myself, which is a luxury
I have not had in more than 10 years. I talked to some
East—and West-Coast friends. And they'd respond
with all kinds of compassionate sounds and say “Well,
it’s only for a semester."

But frankly, no matter what I would still have the
boon of time. And the kids [at Grinnell] are great.
They may not ask as many questions as 1 would like
them to ask but they keep me on my toes. The best
part of teaching are the questions. I’m bored to death
ofwhatI have to say [because] I know it all. The fun

part is when I get a question and have to think.

seas.- What do you eover in your role as a re-
porter?

Gebert: I’ve basically covered the former Ottoman
Empire My second heat is Russia, mainly Siberia
and then also odds and endsiBurma, Mongolia. I

also cover human rights indJewi sues It’s fairly

.im also the Polish rcp [alive forTnube,

5557R- Whnt did you do in Poland under Coma
munism?

Gebertz I was active in democratic opposition. I
was actually om: of the founders of the Free Trade
Union in Warsaw ,..When we had a military Coup

in Dec 1981, I went underground.
That’s what started my journalism
career. [The newspaper I worked
for] bad the widest circulation [of
underground newspapers]. wt
printed 23,000 copies using silk
screen printers. The kind you use
to print t-shirts. You don't need to
worry about power cuts and you can
hide everything quickly. I’m actual—
ly almost religious about silk screen
printing I’ve taught it in Kosovo
and to Burmese refugees It‘s like
a driver ought to know first aid even ifthey don’t ever
have to use it. Democrats are duty bound to know
silkssereen printing, even if they never have to use it.

588: What does it mean to go underground?
What does that entail?

Gehert: There are many ways to go underground.
The most radical is that you live under a false identity
somewhere else this I never had to do althoughI
did have to use false papers occasionally. Then there's
simply living somewhere else for protracted periods of
time. And this 1 did a lot. Then there's taking pre-
cautions, making sure you are not followed, that you
don't have incriminating information on you.

sow: How does it affeer your life and family?

Gehmz It's not recommended for family life. I
was away much of the time. I often did not have ace
cess to a telephone for obvious reasons, but I could
not eall. [My wife] did not knowwhat's happening
We would agree I would call and then when I didn’t
she wouldn't know Did I get arrested? Could I not

it's also very difficult for children one day [my
eldest daughter] turned to me and said,“Dad,will you
promise they won’t kill you?" I promised. The young
or kids noticed a lot We had a cache where we
stored documents and we thought it was brilliant. We
never imagined they knew, but ofeourse they did.

The lost time returns with a vengeance as they
grow up and you don't understand them as well as you
would. I don't regret my actions. But I regret pay—
ing the price. The underground is not a great career
move. Throughout much of that time, we were eXe
tremely poor. Itwas humiliating. ImeanI had family
abroad and they helped, but meat was onee a week if
we were lucky. The one thing I still have not forgiven
the Communists is the time wasted. The beatings
and arrests, you can forget Qicues took up two
hours a day It is a nonsrecoverable theft.

5553: Is there anything you miss?

Gebert: Under Communism there wasn't a lot to
do. So you spent a lot oftime together. You'd walk by
and say‘lSorandrto lives here. Let's pop in." ...There
was a wealth of time to talk [issues and ideas] over.
I've never since had this kind oftime. Not thatl liked
the package deal but I miss the former intimacy
and informality.
