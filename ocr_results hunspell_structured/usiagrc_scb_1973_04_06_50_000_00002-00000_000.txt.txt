Cabinet Shows (houses

by Mike Breed

In a special meeting Friday, March
so the Joint Board approvedthe com-
promise black housing proposalwhr
ich had been worked out by SGA
President Scott Well and the Black
Student Housing Committee.

This proposal established a com-
mittee of two House Presidents,
two black students, and Jim Tedv
erman, to Select rooms to be used
for the black cluster system for the
‘73774 school year, The nlotion
was passed by a 11-2-5 vote. It
had previously been approved by
the Social Policies and Regulations
Committee.

The new Cabinet presented a vars
iety of changes and proposed pro
grams in the regular meeting Wed-
nesday, April 4. PreSIdent Well
presented a reorganization oi the
Student Coordinator's office along
with a redefinition of the concept
of the Coordinator,

Instead of the usual one Coor-
dinator, he has declded to appoint
two. One of these Coordinators wt)»
uld specifically work with Vice-
President Potts on the Committee
structures—Joe Genereux has been
appointed to this position--and the
other will work with Vice Presis
dent Yacknln in the academic area
"Bob Ruhl has been given this
position.

This arrangement has a precedent
irom the ”71-72 school year, when
Terry Clifford and Bob Meyer join-
tly held the position. Traditionally
and constitutionally, however, the
Coordinator has been a separate
office from the rest oi the Cabinet
--the duties have been information
gathering and disseminating and
to act as an ombudsman. The as-
signment 0! each Coordinator to a

Vice Presment, then, amounts to a
major definition of executive roles
in the SGA,

The main body oi the meeting was
discussion of a proposed studente
published guide to courses and [ac-
ulty. The pros and cons of having
such an evaluation sponsored by
SGA were discussed-many oi the
presidents ieit that if the publicas
tion were run by SGA then the effect
would be diluted and the editors
might be subject to the same co—
opting process that afflicts cabinet
members,

The matter was referred to a
Committee which will proposea met»

ClEP Controversy Distant

by John Wylie

Recent controversy among univers
sily professors about the validity of
the CLEP (College Level Examin-
ation Program) test has had little
effect at Grinnell, since the college
has never recognized CLEP credits.

CLEP is one or the two malur
credit-by»examination programs
sponsored by the College Entrance
Examination Board (CEEB). Alth»
ougll Grinnell does not recognize
CLEP, it frequently grants credit
under the other program, Advanced
Placement tests (AP),

Registrar Charles Seller explained
that CLEP had originally been in-
tended for use with people who had
been out of the academic world for
a number oi years and were conside
ering resuming their studies. It gave
such individuals the opportunity to
get college level credit for material
learned outside of school.

However, CLEP test scores have
been increasingly used to exempt
freshmen entering college from cers
tain requirements. Faculty andads
ministrators became alarmed when
large numbers oi entering “ireshe
men" testedsout of all their first

year courses, thus entering college
at the sophomore level.

Further experience indicated that
the students were not really ready
ior sophomore level courses, and a
number were advised to "drop back"
to the ireshman level after only a
iew weeks at classes
A‘P credits at Grinnell are gran—
ted not only on the basis of test
scores, but also on work within an
AP course in high school, Seller
explained that a teacher rccommr
endation and complete course deSr
cription accompanies every AP test
score, and that credit is granted
only after a complete examination
of all these iactors.

Faculty Chairman Philip Klntner
explained that the policy against
accepting CLEP credits has never
been Iormalized by a vote of the
faculty, because there has been a
general consensus that the test’s
correlation with academicperform»
once have been inadequate.

“AP correlations are excellent,
but CLEP correlations are very
poor tor ireshmen entering col-
lege”, Kintner told the son,

nine members of the Office have
been divided into three teams con-

while still allowing for a variety

The flexibility and variety are
essential components of the office

in judicial council proceedings.
Mediation is preferred by the of-
iice over jurisprudence however,
and hopeiully problems brought to
the attention oi the oiiice can be
resolved without utilization of Judi
icial proceedings.

perhaps due to the utopian hare
mony and accord existing at Grine
nell, or the high proportion of civil
libertarians on campus, students
have failed to consult the office.
It may be that Grinnellians have an
unusual capacity “to talk it out a»
mug themselves”, but students who
have found this inadequate now have
a new option open to them"

Members oi the faculty approved
a recommendation from the EXECUV
tive Council last Monday to adopt
a combined plan in nursing with
the Rush University College otNu—
rsing and Allied Sciences in Chis
cago, Illinois, The program will be
run on a 3-2 basis similar to coop»
erative programs between Grinnell
and other institutions in the fields
oi law, medicine, and engineering,
and is expected to begin next iall.
Gl‘innell will be the eighth of the
twelve ACM schools to implelnent
a cooperative program with Rush,

In other business, the [acuity ap
proved a recommendation to award
an honorary degree to Ms. Louis
Rosenfield Noun, an alumnus of the
college and activist in the Iowa Ci-
vil Liberties Union, and heard an-
nouncements from Registrar Char—
les seller regarding the times sche
eduled ior prerregistration tor the
next two semesters,

Pres-registration tor the tall sem-
ester of 1973-74 is April SOsMay
5, and {or the second semester of
next year it will be at an earlier
time than usual, November 5-No»
vember lo, for the convenience
at professors and the college book
store.

Grinnell was approached last sum»
mer by representatives from the
Rush College, according to Dean
Waldo Walker, Desiring a broader
liberalral'ts background for its de—
gree candidates than is usual for
students of nursing and medical
technology, Rush at the time come
municated with several schools pro»
posing cooperative programs.

Dean Walker then formulated two
years oi liberal arts preparation
at Grinnell and two years at Rush,
with graduates receiving both the
Rush degree and a no. degree irom
Grinnell.

Debate on the matter centered
around the question oi how the pros
gram would affect admissions and
applicant quality, and whether or
not the program would compromise
the college’s conception of liberal
education.

Dean of Admissions Nicholas Ryan
reported on a telephone poll con-
ducted by his office of several high
schools in Iowa, Missouri, and Ill-

inois, and indicated that he found _

little interest among the high schr
ools tor the 2-2 proposal, but"cons

slderaole interest in the 3-2 pro-
gram," particularly in Chicagohigh
schools where the Rush school
is Well known.

Several professors questioned the
academic excellence ofstudents who
tend to enter into nursingprograms.

Most discussion, however, focused
on the implications of the program
for liberal arts education and a
memo from Associate Professor of
History Don Smith about the pro-
posed 2-2 program.

The program, said Smith, would
"introduce a new type oi program
into our curriculum,”

"Such programs," Said Smith in
his memo, “would work in a way
which runs strongly counter to that
conception ofliberal education which
has hitherto characterized the col—
lege."

Several other faculty members
supported this position during the
meeting, Assistant Professor oi
English Peter Connelly observed
that under a tentative course sche-
dule for the 2-2 program prepared
by walker only eight credits were
devoted to the Humanities, ”and
that can’t possibly be liberal arts
education.” ‘

Gregory Guroff, Associate Profes-
sor of History, countered, however,
with the observation that the elimin—
ation or requirements two years ago
in effect created that situation anys
way.

Despite protestations from Assos
clate Professor of Music James
Wyly that students often leave the *
college aiter their sophomore years
creating, in eiiect, their own 2,2
programs, the faculty rejected the
2-2 proposal by a vote of 34-134.

Feeling that the S-Zprogram attore
ded a greater opportunity for liberal
arts preparation, the faculty ac-
cepted the latter proposal 454-1,

“ ‘1‘le PRESIDENT is hobbled in
