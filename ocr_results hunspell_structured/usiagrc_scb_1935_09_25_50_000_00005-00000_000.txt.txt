SPORTS

By HENRY IIIKSCH

In looking over a copy of the
“Football Annual," issued recently
we spotted the name of Jim Brad?
ley, on the All-American list at the
full back posts along with 34
other football candidates from all
over the country. The full extent
of this honor can be realized only
when one considers the fact that
the only other Missouri Valley
players whose names appeared on
the list are My Ubl, Drake quar-
terback, Dwight Halfeli, washing-
ton tackle, Irving Londy, Washing
ton guard, and Chuck oi-ebougli,
Drake halfback.

Grinnell prospects for this
season as diagnosed in the mt-
nual read thus: ”Improvement
is expected, due to the pres
ence of some good sophomore
linemen. As usual, howcrer,
the team will he light. and
again must stress aerial foot»
ball against power opponents."

p , ..

The annual rated Gnlmell Z28th
in the nation last year under the
AzziJ‘tatem systern, whatever that
may be. Ratings of other Missouri
Valley teams were Drake, 191,
Oklahoma A. K: M., 123, ,Creighton,
210, Tulsa, 25, Washburo, 197.
Minnesota rated first for the has
tion and Pittsburgh second.

Joe McKlvecn, a member of
Grimlell’s crock mile relay
team last year, is reported
bed-ridden with “athlete's
heart." Joe has been laid up
for about three months and is
in serious condition,

Interest in local sports was
somewhat eclipsed early in the
week by the Boer-Louis right. We
understand that in certain quar-
ters of the campus real money
passed over the boards.
