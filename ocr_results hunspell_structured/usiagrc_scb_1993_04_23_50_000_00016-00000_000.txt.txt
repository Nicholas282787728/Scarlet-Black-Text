Students made it known in a
resolution passed by SGA on Februr
ary l7, and at a student Speakrout in
the Forum during the truStees‘ visit
on February 26, that they were un-
happy that the decision had been made

“On Friday, I asked Oda

Ferguson’s Decision
'i‘hehousewasapprovedbocause

of a decision made by President

Pamela Ferguson lasr Thursday,

which assured that all [we language
houses would exist next year, The
decision was made because of rcr
ports to the administration that stu-
dcnts had been intimidated out of
signing up for the language houses.

“About a month ago, it was
brought up in Executive Council that
various language faculty had heard
that studean were being intimidated
rrom signing up in the language
houses,” said Ferguson. “During the
last week before the deadline, there
were increased reports of harassment

”On Friday, tasked Oda [Callison] if
the house could apply while missing
one person. She called me back on
Monday saying that the application
wasn’t finished, and there was nothing
she could do. On Thursday 1 was told
that the application was approved,
without any changes made to it."

and intimidation from the language
faculty. This seriously ﬂawed the ba-
sisof the original processand because
of this, I made the decision to go ahead
and have these language houses.“

Questionof Harassment
Language faculty havesupported
the decision, but questions remain.
French professor Jan Gross was
oneof the faculty members whoraisod
the question of harassment a month
ago in an Executive Council meeting
on February24,1993. The minutesof
thatmccting paraphrased Gross’ con»
cem “that in their recruiting of resin
dents for language houses, the de-

partments found that students felt
reluctant to come forward, because
their peers might treat them as trai-
tors to the students’ protest about the
way the administration had made the
decision to establish the houses."

The minutes from that meeting
anti a statement released on Wednes-
day by Gross do
notmentionthat
facultyhadbcen
told of specific
incidents of ha-
rassmentas of a
monthago,only
that language faculty believed that
harassment was a possibility.

Gross said in a later interview
that “I have no way ofknowing why
students made their decisions. I
couldn‘t say that it’s harassment eXr
aclly, maybe peer pressure is a better
word,butwedidnoticeinourclasses
thatstudents feltuncomfonablccom»
ing forward in this environment."

Gross went on to say that the
au'nosphere concerning the language
houses is “McCarthy-lie," and thcrc~
fore it is hard to gauge student sup
port for the houses. Given this nega-
u'veaunosphere towards thelanguage
houses, she believes Ferguson's de.
cision to establish all five language
houses was justified.

ProfessorDavidKeenan,facult.y
advisor of China House, also sup
ports the decision to create language
houses. He heard reports of coercion
from other faculty members, but not.
from students. ”I heard things from
students, but there was no coercion
per se, it was more like 'hey, it's
really uneool to be siding with the
faculty on this one.‘ Some people in

China house did feel this pressure,

Student Recation

Student reaction to the
President’s decision has been gcncrv
ally negative. A petition was signed
by 553 students op-
posing what itcalled,
“the administration‘s
failure to follow their
own guidelines and
policies,” and the
"blatant disregard for
the April 9th deadline,

Student representatives and
members of project houses which
were denied spaces have spent the
week arguingttteissue wilhadminis-
trntion and faculty.

“Nowhere in the policy does it
say that students aren‘t
allowed to tell each
other theiropinions,or
say ‘dcn’t live in the
language houses.‘ No-
where does it say that
the process can be
changed because of a
negative atmosphere,”
said SGA vicc presi-
dent Dave Hatzfcld. ”Though I be-
lievetherewasa negativcaunosphcre,
[still believe that widespread student
harassment was just a rumor."

Hatzfeld was part of the com-
mittee which drew up the guidelines
for the language houses.

Students feel Betrayed

Students who were denied
project houses have also spoken to
Ferguson, protesting the decision.

Many Say that they feel betrayed,

“The Administration created a
policy, and now they’ve broken it. I
don’t see how they can expect us to
follow the rules if they can‘t do it
themselves,” said first year student
Miles Stern, who had signed up to be
in Community Service House. “We
had all our people signed up by the
deadline, and were told by Oda
Callison that two of the language
houses had failed. Why didn't these
charges of harassment come up be
fore then?”

Decision is Final
Despite her critics, President Fcrr
guson says that her decision is ﬁnal.
“lregretthatstudentsarounhappy
with the decision, but I'm conﬁdent
that the process was simply flawed,
andI‘mjustnotgoingtosupportsomer

“I regret that students are un«
happy with the decision, but I’m
confident that the process was
simply flawed, and I’m just not
going to support something where
students said ‘I felt intimidated!"

Meanwhile, SGA has mobilized

over the language house deCision. A
protest meeting and march from
