Russian director Smekhov works with Grinnellians

Isaak Babel’s Sundown will highlight the Sesquicentennt’al “Odessa Symposium”

By LINDSAY HAGY
Reporter

Russian actor, director, and play
wright Veniam Smekhov has been
brought to Grinnell to direct this
year's fall play, Isaak Babel‘s Sun-
down. The play was forbidden in
Russia during the Stalin era be-
cause Babel was considered an
enemy of communism. and as re»
sult, he was killed in 1914. Mr.
Smekhov wished to perform this
play as part of Grinnell's Sesqui-
centennial “Odessa Symposium,"
in order to recognize the abunr
dance of artistic geniuses coming
out of Odessa at that time as well
as because of its great potential
for interpretation.

Mr. Smekhov believes that the
professors he works with at
Grinneil, such as Ellen Mease and
Pip Gordon, have great knowl»
edge, of notonly American theater,
but world theater, “It is a very good
surprise for my wife and I. For real
theater it is absolutely necessary to
have a live connection between the
actors and the directors so that they
are able to develop their fantasy
together. and I feel we have that
here. My only sorrow is that I don’t
speak English, but it is good for
an Odessian performance because
in Odessa people speak not with
their tongues but with their hands."

The biggest difference between
Russian and American theater is
that in Russia they speak Russian
and in America they speak [in

glish," he said, The director feels
that he and his colleagues and ac-
tors have worked beyond that wttli
the help of his “biggest helpers",
his wife and his dIctlonary. The

only other difference he notes is
that Russian theater is treated less
as simply entertainment and more
as .i teacher. “People believe in
theater like some kind of church,”

he said.

Finding Home is the product of
Saiia’s work over the summer on
a grant provided by President
Pamela Ferguson. Saiia spent the
summer doing visual research,
making models, and finally, setting
up the piece itself. He was assisted
by his on—campus advisor, Pip Gory
don, professor for the theater de-
partment, and Kevin Curtis, a pro
fessor from the University of
Northern Iowa.

The work consists of pods, com
posed of white plaster on the out—
side and brown peat mess on the
inside, that have holes in them.
These pods are placed within three
differently sized holes.

Saiia was interested in installing
a small environment in the land. In
his visual research for the art, he
looked at nests, eggs, pods, seeds,
and other things.

weather will change the artwork
