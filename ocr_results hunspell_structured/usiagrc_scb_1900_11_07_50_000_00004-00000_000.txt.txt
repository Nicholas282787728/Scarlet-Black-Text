S U. I. vs Chicago.

Saturday last Iowa established
her right to a claim in the western
football championship by defeats
ing the University of Chicago by
a score of17-O. ‘

Both teams expected victory,
hut Iowa played beyond the op
ponentsexpectations. Inthe line
one team proved as strong as the
other but Iowa excelled in her
team work. Her backs were never
without interference.

In the ﬁrst half neither team
was able to scorebut the signs of
fatigue were more apparent on
the Maroons than on the men
from the State University.

in the second halt Chicago was
entirely outclassed, Iowa Scoring
two touch downs, two goals and a
place kick.

Iowa has the strongest team she
hasever had in her football history
and will make a good showing in
her claims for the western cham~
pionship.

Ghost stories were

‘Savsge related some personal ens

counters with a ghost, arid Crahb,

port the foundations of ghosts and
all allusions. The program was

altho it was not what some would
