‘Wrestlers aim for Improvement

by Robert Meyer
0 Last weekend and this past
Wednesday the Grinnell grapplers
fell to four opponents.

Grinnell, who hosted all four
meets, lost a close match on
Friday against U. of Missouri-St.
Louis (25—20). Saturday. the
Pioneers lost two meets, one
against Knox (43-3) and the other
against Carleton (39781, While on
Wednesday a tough Central team
. downed Grinnell, 3640.

The scoring in wrestling allows
the winner to earn 3, 4, 5 and 6
points for his team score. If the
\vlnner defeats his opponent by H
points he wins a decision and three
team points; an B—ll point victory
is called a major decision and
gains four team points A 12 point
or greater victory is called a
superior victory and wins five

team points. When the victor pins
his opponent or wins by a forfeit he
earns six team points.

Against UM-St. Louis the
Pioneers won three of the seven
matches, and had to forfeit three
matches. Gordon Stacey m4) won
a decision with his 51 Victory,
Mark Frankel (177) won a superior
decision (2270) and Jon
Christianson (190) pinned his
opponent. Marquis Lyles won by a
forfeit.

Coach Stephan Moss was proud
of Grinnell’s performance. He
commented that, after the close
match the Pioneers “were on a
good high Friday night.” However,
the grapplers' performance on
Saturday was not as rewarding.
Coach Moss’ explanation was that

Women’s basketball looks to

by Laurie Cragg

The Grinnell Women's
Basketball Team dropped its first
game of 1978 to Graceland last
Saturday,

The prospects for the rest of the
season look hopeful. The team’s
remaining schedule includes
games against Cornell, Mar-
shalltown and William Penn’s JV

.team. Cornell has had a poor
season and was defeated in their
last confrontation with the
Pioneers. Marshalltown has lost

/ BIKE

two of their starters due to injuries.
With these facts in mind Coach
Cindy Winkler commented that the
upcoming schedule looked
challenging but encouraging for a
victory

Carleton arrived in Grinnell With
a full team. As will probably be the
Case for the rest of this season, the
Pioneers were forced to forfeit the
weights of 142, 150 and
heavyweight. Grinnell‘s only
victories came on major decisions
by David Greenwald (118) and
Stacey (134). The match against
Knox was even less pleasing for the
Pioneers as their only three points
were earned by Frankel (177i with
the final decision being 3-2.

On Wednesday the Pioneers
performance resembled their
earlier performance against UM-
St. Louis. Central, undoubtedly
Grinnell’stoughest opponent thus
far, won only three of the six
matches wrestled,

After Lyles (118) was pinned and
Greenwald (126) was down 40 in
the first few minutes of the match,
everyone was sure that Central
was destined to humiliate Grinnell.
Greenwald, however. gave
Grinnell momentum as he
dominated the final periods of his
match and lost by a close margin
(5%). Stacey (134) controlled hls
match and won a decision (3-1),
After two Grinnell forfeits. Frank
Corrigan (158) and Christianson
(190) won by the respective scores
of 6'5 and 870.

Coach Moss describes the
grapplers; performances as ins
consistent. He believes, however,
that things are beginning to jell for
the Pioneers and expects the
wrutlers to be at their best at the
Midwest Conference meet. which
will be held at Grinnell February
24. Saturday the Pioneers host yet
another meet, this time against a
formidable Dubuque team

future

Teamwise, the girls are much
more at ease on the court. Their
attitudes are becoming more
positive yet realistically the team
assesses their specific needs for
improvement.

Sophomore Stephanie Nelson has
returned to the lineup and was tied
for high scorer I 8 pts.) in the
Graceland game. She was injured
earlier in the season with a broken
ankle.

The team played William Penn
last night and plays Cornell College
tomorrow. The team‘s next home
game is Tuesday, Feb. 7th at 6:00
pm. in Darby Gym,

Swim weekend:success
men Show depth, flippers fail to lose

by Bill Raynolds

Last weekend's swim meets
presented an opportunity for the
Pioneers to take measure of this
year‘s progress. After the school
was generous enough to send the
team to Florida, it was time for the
men to prove themselves

The meet on Friday showed that
While Grinnell doesn’t have any
superstars, it has the depth of
talent necessary for an excellent
season. In their quadrangular
meet, the Pioneers were bested
only by Rockford (57-38), which
boasts 11 scholarship swimmers.
Standout for the Pioneers was
Brian Jones who won both the 200
yd. individual medley and the 500
yd. freestyle. Grinnell also won the
200 yd. medley relay (Bruce Jones,
Greg Gomez, Greg Olson, and
Chris Corlun). Diving was won by
Tom Helpenstel, and Gomez swam
a 1:06 to win the breaststroke.

At the Pioneer Relays on
Saturday afternoon, the Grinnell
swimmers took second place In the
eight team competition. The
Pioneers’ only victory came from
Brian Jones and Frank (Fwanky)
Halley in the 200 yd. breaststroke
Rockford stole the show with a
record breaking performance in
the 400 yd freestyle relay wlth a
time of3:21,4, and won the meet by
72 points.

The final score: Rockford 392,
Grinnell 320, Augustana 304,
Northwest Missouri State 252,
Wayne 206, Loras 188, Drake 173,
and Coe 102.

Coach Obermiller viewed the
meet as a success for the weary
Grinnell swimmers and has great

 

expectations, for them this
weekend at St. Johns and Carleton,

Losing streak at eleven

Men’s basketball: same old story

by Russ Winick

The Pioneer losing streak
stretched to eleven games as
Grinnell fell prey to Cornell 105-81
in Darby last Friday and then
suffered a 9544 spanking at
William Penn four nights later.
The team’s record noW stands at 1,
13.

A large crowd saw Cornell’s
frontliners gun the Pioneers right
out of the gym. “We never shoot
like that," exclaimed Cornell's
assistant coach, in reference to his
squad‘s 55 per cent accuracy rate.
Grinnell couldn't conjure up
anything to counter the attack. The
Pioneers rarely had the op-
portunity to fast break, and their 1-
271-1 zone press backfired as
Cornell was able to break it with
ease and create numerous 3 on 2
scoring Situations

The team’s showing was more
respectable against William Penn.
Down by 13 in the first half, the
Pioneers Worked their way to a
two-point lead with about 12
minutes left in the game. But then
the statesmen rallied and ran the
score up to its final lopsided
proportions, '

Leading rebounder Pat Walsh
noted: “We‘re always in the game
with ten minutes left. That's where
welose our poise.” “We don’t know
how to deal with a leadiwe force
shots up and try to increase it," he
added.

The Pioneers have been hurting
personnel-Wise. In addition to the
lingering lower-extremityi ' '
of starters Matthew Miller and
Philip Guttman, freshmen Mike
ndCurry and Mark Dyreson both.

Last Friday, when the last race
ended, the women thought they had
lost to both UNI and USD, For-
tunately. someone discovered that
the meet had been scored using
interscholastic rules rather than
the correct intercollegiate rules.
Thus, when the meet was rescored,
Grinnell had defeated both their
opponents. Saturday proved not to
be as hectic, as the squad trounced
Augustana. Coach Peggy Riedesel
was ”. . . pleased with the team’s
overall performance.” Nine in-
dividual efforts by Margo Wessner.
Debbie Jalowiec, Ginny Munoz,
Sheryl Huntoon, Renee Johnson,
Becky Chipman, and Ann Cleaver
were also pleasing to Coach
Riedesel.

0n the heels of those three dual
meet Victories? the woih‘e’n's‘swim
team is all fired up for tomorrow's
Miracle Relays.

The Relays get under way at
11:30 with the diving Competition,
and following at 1:30 will be the
swimming events. All nine squads.
Central Missouri State, Emporia
State. Luther, UNI, South Dakota,
South Dakota State, UW at
LaCrosse. Kearney State, and host
Grinnell, have the potential to
leave town with the championship
in hand,

A fierce rivalry is developing
between the Pioneers and Kearney
State. Grinnell, the reigning
champs. won last year's Miracles
due to a disqualification of one of
Kearney's relay teams. However,
just the opposite occurred in 1975
when Kearney State captured the
title. Undoubtedly, the Nebraska
school will be looking for revenge
tomorrow.

The Miracle Relays is the
women’s last important home
meet of the season,

McCurry was probably the team’s
top outside shot and Dyreson had
the potential to become this
school's best player since former
conference scoring champion John
l-laigh.

But the biggest problem may be
lthe losing streak itself, which
appears to have resulted in_ a
1general lack of enthusiasm. with
road trips to Carleton and Coe next
on the schedule, Grinnell has yet
another chance to put things
together. Walsh insists that “with
the talent on this team, there's no
way we should only have won one
game." He feels that the Pioneers
should beat Carleton and hold their
own against Coe. “It‘s a matter of
organization,f'.the.big freshperson
concluded.
