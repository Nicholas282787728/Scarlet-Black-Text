fact that the college has groping too

into its new hall the Calocagntlliaus
were invited to share it and accepted.
This joint occupation has been contin-
ued ever since, though at one time the
interesm of Institute was thrown ra»
(her more with Ellis. Few joint pro-
grams were held for a number of
years and these were not the exclusive
social aflairs of today but rather open
literary programs to which the public
was invited and constituted the public
appearance of the societies which
is now supplanted by the intei'rsociety
play.

ished the lnslitilters h)‘ virlue of (in

at the two halls on the third floor, and
the west rooln was talvcn and has been

furnished in the best style ol the time
with a ﬁgured paper on the walls and
a carpet on the iloor which rmlliiinlzzl

concerning the nature and composition
of the air. He lamented the fact that
the great chemist lollered himscli‘ and

Lavoisiel's chlel strength lay in his
laculty for drawing correct conclusions

and the world‘at large. He rectiﬁed
many misconceptions and laid a good

An article which recently appeared
in El. current periodical on “The Poetic
Drama in America," by the noted nc»
tor, William Favei'sham, is of unusual
interest to Grlilnell students, owing to
the fact that c nnc example or this
form of dramatic productions is soon
to be presented hr the Chrcstouinthian
and Ellis societies.

The leading wrrtcr ol thc poetical
dizinlzt lotlar is Stephen Phillips and
