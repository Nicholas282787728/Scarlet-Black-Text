the scarlet and black

RaCe, gender intersect

W hen I moved
from New York Crty
to Jerusalem, Israel in
1970, it could irot (lcr
alone would not) have
occurred to me that 26
years latei I would be a
professor at a liberal arrs college in Grinncll, lowa with so many
outstanding students.

If that seems strange, what would have been even more surprisr
ing was rlrat I would encouarer so many students who had never
had a teacher of color as well as students who had never had close
friendships with a Black person because there were none or very
few -- in their social environment. But ofmore signiﬁcance, in 1970
it would have been unthinkable that, more than a quartet efa cenr
tury later, prestigious academic institutions would still be debating
the merit or necessity for racial diversity. Writing, at the end of2004,
from the vantage point of a scholar who fits the popular term multi—
ply positioned, and as a woman who grew up in the
sixties, I was, and remain, mysrifred (naively) by
the persistence of racial preconceptions arid prejur
dice among educated people of my generation.

But if I am mystified by prejudice among those
who grew up during rhc Civil Rights cra,1 am ap-
palled by the persistence of practices of prejudice
accompanied by protests of innocence. In this sper
cifrc context, the lack of even polite public criti»
c'tsm of the absence of feminist scholars of color
in general, and Black feminist scholars in particur
lat, among the distinguished visiting scholars for this year’s theme
Feminist Scholarship Today, is remarkable. If anyone thought that
this issue had been discussed, debated and resolved in the twenti—
eth century, they will be surprised to discover that though we are (I
think) in the 21st century, the news seems not to have arrived in our
community. Or perhaps it has.

As Kimberle Crenshaw (one of Harvard Law Schools distin-
guished Black alumni and bur one of many examples ofa promincnr
feminist scholar ofcolor), who holds a joint appointmcnr ar Colunu
bia University Law School and UCLA School of Law, points out,
many of those who work in the academy (scholars, students, staff)
are still challenged by rhe virtual lunch counrer, which is manifcsrcd
by a colorblind discourse or, more succinrly, rhc rationalization l‘oi-
racial power in which few are served and many are denied (eds. Vale
des et. al., 26).

Creiishaiv and other critical rare theorists have carefully mapped

 

The lack of even polite
public criticism of the
absence of feminist
scholars in general,
and Black feminist
scholars in particular...
is remarkable

out how a conservative backlash rs not necessarily carried out by
self identifying conservatives rs manifests itself in the academy
rhrough a strategic insistence on acrivaring a mechanism ofdcmoer
racy in which invoking academic freedom serves to veto inclusive
curricular revisions and to silence the minority Racism, sexism, nae
tivism and other isms are too often complntmentalizetl as diversity
is analogized to a slroppinglrst flom which one can pic and choose
from rhe isolarion or the monochromaric complexion of depart-
ments and majors wherc whiteness remains an unmarked default (as
in the phrase feminism today. When did feminism morph back into
a singular concept without a prefatorial adjective).

Since my return to the US. in 1991 to pursue a PhD, no year
passes without coming across an article that remarks on the dif»
frculry ofchallenging hierarchy and subordination in rlre absence of
strong student activism. Sometimes this is said with a tinge of nosV
talgia for the sixties (Without the excesses). Yet some of us are com,
forted by New York University Law Professor, Professor Derrick
Bell, who instrucrively reminds academics of color that although
academic faculties either ban us from their midst
entirely or ensure that our numbers do not exceed
one or two readers who hail our work may not
be powerful but they do exist. (eds. Valdes et. al.
412). our presence is troublesome only to those
who insisr on protocols of polite silence and ig-
nore how these enable discriminatory practices
protected under the shield of claims to academic
freedom (energetically advocated whenever gate-
keepers face objections to their authority, an
insight aCliViSrs in rhc Womcns Movcmcnr ac
quired from activists in Civil Rights Movement). Those of us who
choose a place at the vanguard of the struggle against prejudice and
historical amnesia may be encouraged by Derrick Bell’s observarion
that, alrhouglr racisru may turn our to be a permanent characrcrisric
of US sociel'Vr our lives are made more meaningful by making a
contribution against the multiple permutations of racism and their
intersection with other virulent forces of oppression. It is a perspec-
tive which resonates well with rhc great Bdbylonianrborn scholar,
Rabbi Hillel whose injunction, written in the first century BCE.
reads “Ifl am not for myself, then who will be for me? And if] am
only for myself, rhen wlrrr am I? And ifnot now, rvhen>“ is a good
starting poinr for helping to bring abour change in the lacarions in
which we ﬁnd ourselves either as insiders or as outsiders.

SGA VP explains leave of absence

As time continues to
distance the student body
from the memory of the
t r a g i c
s u i ,
C id e s
ofour fellow students in the spring of2003,l feel
that it is important for all ofus to take the time
to recognized that depression and other serious
mental illnesses are likely more ofa problem (0*
day on our campus, and many others, than they
were then.

By now, I am sure that many of you have ei-
ther heard or read abour my lcavc ofabscnce, quite
likely in the same paper in which this piece is pubr
lislied, and I felt that it would be irresponsible of me not to use this
opportunity to continue to bring up awareness of the mental health
problems facing our campus. After being diagnosed almost exactly
a year ago with major depression and after suffering from it, symp
toms, which I quietly denied along with my sexual orientation, for
several years before that,l have a unique appreciation of how drfr
ficult a place Grinnell can be to deal with mental illness.

The national statistics show that this isn’t just a problem at
Grinnell. In the Spring 2003 National College Health Assessment
(19,497 college srudenrs on 33 campuses), 2 our of3 students re
ported “feeling overwhelmed by all they had to do," and over 50%
reported “feeling things were hopeless” at least once during the year.
More than 1 in 3 reported “feeling so depressed it was difficult to
function." Almost 10% rcporred "seriously considering arrernpring
suicide" and over 1% reported “attempting sulcidc."'l‘hese statistics
are frightening and something needs to change.

We all know that Grinnell is an incredibly stressful place, but
there are mys to deal with this stress. The thing that I want to
emphasize in writing this is to Listen to what your mind and body is
telling you when it comes to your health and to do your best to ig-
nore the outside pressures of professors, fellow students and society

I spent all of last year struggling daily with extreme feelings
of sadness and hopelessness and long periods of self-destructive
thoughts all because I couldn't allow myscif ro accept rhar ir was
okay to do something other than what 1 rhoughr was expected of me

 

Until we accept that
we each have our
limits, and that it is
okay to admit our
faults...we cannot
expect our problems
to go away.

by orlrcrs but more imporrautly, what i expected ofruysell rut ofus
here are very iritelligent,unique and gifted people, but we are not iris
falliblc. Not‘ all of us can get an A or even a C in every class we take,
not all ofus can participate in 10 student groups
and be a leader in S of them and not all of us can
graduate from Grinncll in 4 years and get incr-cdr
ible jobs or get into the best grad schools and we
can dcfrnircly iror do all ofthesc things combined.

Until we accept that we each have our limits ind
that it is okay to admit our faults, and like I have
had to do, even admit that we might have to take a
break, we cannot expect our problems to go away.
lfyou and yourself in trouble or iusr feeling like
you need to talk to someone, remember to use the
amazing resources we have here in professional counseling srudenr
staffaatl RLCs, rhev really can be helpful.

My ultimate advice to all ofyou is to take the time to take care of
yourself. We arc so otrca focused on other people and orlrci things
that we dont take the time to take Cart: of ourselves. This _c:rre ins
eludes basic things like sleeping at nighr and eating healthy food.

There is a reason these things are considered basic to survival
and we should probably do rhem on a regular basis. Above all else,
if you are feeling overwhelmed by stress, remember that lr is okay
ro take a rcmporary break, Warch a movie, read a book, exercise, do
somcrlring that you know will make you feel better while keeping
in mind that whether you get a 3+ or a Br on that paper you are
writing isn't going to matter at all in the long term and most likely
even in the short term, and always remember that it is okay to ask
for an extension.

The advice that I have heard over and over from alums is that
things they value the most from being Grinnell didn’t come from
classes, they came from the time they spent with fellow students and
other community members. Classes and resume budding involves
mcnr aren'r everything, let yourselthave a good time, rake advantage
of the resources we have here and actually make rhcsc years ones you
will remember fondly and not ones you will remember as the years
you struggled with stress and illness that you couldn’t accept at the
time. To the senior class, my best wishes for a happy and meaningful
life wherever it might take you. To the rest of you, I‘ll see you next

fall.
