those yesterday afternoon at the
gymnasium whose iootsteps-in
crossing the ﬂoor of the gallery

bition of the classes, whose voices
did most toward distmbing those

to be respectful, the above rule
would give the correct solution.
It would also answerthe question:
Who were the banner and ribbon
thieves who despoiied a number
of Grinneli girls of their colors on
the evening of the Mt. Vernon
debate, but it leads to wmng cone
elusions when we apply it to the
other instance oi rowdyism which
