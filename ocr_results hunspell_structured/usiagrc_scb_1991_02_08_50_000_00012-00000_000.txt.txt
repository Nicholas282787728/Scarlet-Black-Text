After jumping out to an
early lead thel’ioneers never looked
back. The Pioneers successfully
executed their plan tokeep Knox's
offense tentative, and weresolid on
offense as well.

we gave them a different defense
on every possession," said coach
Ted Eskildsen. Knox was left cone

with a more 14 points for most of
the first half. Knox had a dismal
total of 16 in the first half, come
pared to Grinnell's 41.

”We had Knox in amcntal
strangle hold,” said Eskildsen.
“They came in here and did not
react to the envtronrnent well," he
added,

offensively, the Pioneer
machine keeps rolling. “We are
teaming how to create mismatches,"
said Eskildscn, and the Pioneers
were taking advantage of them.

Missy Sharer led all score
ers with 27 paints. icnny Wood
had 18, and Amy Fort contributed
14. Jon Kelly and Lisa York pro-
vided ﬂoor lcadcrshtp. and strong
ottenstvc rebounding respectively.

Summing up the game
Eskildsen said that the Pioneers
“played as well as you can play at
this time . . . Wejustcan’tplay any
better.”

Tuesday night‘s game
proved that the Pioneers are human

own foe against Graceland in
Darby. “We looked like a team that
wasmentallytired,"saidEskildsen.

The women pulled it to
gether,however,coming out witha
74-62 win. The non»cont‘erence
victory was keyed by a balanced
attack. with Sharer going for 28,

Kelley for 8,

There was another high-
lightto the win on Tuesday night as
well. Willi 6 minutes gone in the
second half Missy Sharer scored
her 1,000lh career point.

Currently tied for first in
the south division, the Pioneers
