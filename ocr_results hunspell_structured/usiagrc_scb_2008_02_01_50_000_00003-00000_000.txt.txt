This semester Grinnellians welcome to
campus what could be the first college swing
set west of the Mississippi.

sidewalks was just scream-
ing for something to be put
there,” said Brad Bishop ’08,
SGA treasurer and a mem~
ber of Strident Initiative
Fund (STIFund).

The dream ofinsmllitlg a campus swing scr,
originally proposed in a 2004 student initiarive,
was ﬁnally realized thanks to STIFuncl, the
committee that formed last spring to ﬁnance

and implement strident initiatives. “We realr
lied that it had never come to fruitition and
that the students really wanted it and it would
be fun," said SGA President Megan Goering
’08.

To pay for installation
STlFund jomed forces with
Student Affairs. who cov-
ered the cost of labor and
maintenance provided by
Facilities Management.

“I feel very vicrorious,"snid Bishop, "it's not

dent body, but it’s something rlnr can be seen

around campus that's ﬁnally gotten done."

Thus far, the swing-set hasn't done much
except stand in a state of poetic abandon. “I
honestly haven’t gone on it yet because it’s been
so cold,"said STIFund member Ami Freebcrg
'10, who is also an sets photographer.

Most students seem to share these senti—
ments, but enthusiasm for the swings“ is still
prevalent. “We’re rcally excited for the spring
ro come so we can actually ﬁnally use it," said
Goering. “Maybe ir will become a centerpiece
ofseasonal culture on campus."

It may have taken a few years, but Grinncll
students are ﬁnally seeing their swingescr. And
it’s only the beginning. “I was talking ro a few
people about the possibility of a big jungle
gyln,”st\id Goering. As the swing-set proves,
anything is possible. All it takes is a little snl»
