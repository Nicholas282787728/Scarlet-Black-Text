Survey Shows Lack
Advertising

Less than one per cent of all in-
struction given by American colleges
and universities iS devoted to sub-
jects designed to prepare the future
business executive to deal with prob-
lems of marketing and advertising,
according to a survey just completed
by the bureau of research and educa-
tion of the advertising federation of
America and made public by Alfred
T. Falk, director of the bureau.

0n the Whole, the student’s alma
mater does a good job in general
business training but falls short of
giving sufficient instruction in the
fundamental subjects in modern com-
modity distribution and sales. Only
37 collegiate institutions in the Unit-
ed States adequately cover these subs
jccts.

“Big Ten" Fail

The fundamental Subjects, accord-
ing to the survey report, are adverr
tising, markoting. salesmanship. re-
tailing snd wholesaling. foreign trade
and transportation. These are cited

The backﬁeld will be bolstered by
the return of Graﬂund and James.
while Duncan will be taking his reg-

Cinema league in New York, this

a thing which is usually lacking in
amateur photoplays."

“The acting." said the critic. “is as
good as the avemge found in plays
of this kind." Mr. Gale felt. that the
comedians played their roles the best
although their part was a bit ever-
worked. “The photoplay." he said ”is
consistently good with the exception
of two or three flat scenes."

Fresh Drawn Sophomores
in lntercln'ss Scrap Today

Freshmen “drowned" the supine
more class in the annual interclass
battle which was staged in the form
of s tug-ofswar across a creek at the
country club this afternoon.

Three trials resulted in the fresh-
men winning two and thc sopho-
mores the other. The sophomores
were outnumbered three to one. but
in the second encounter which the
freshmen won, the number on each
side was even.

The victors pulled the other team
completely across the water and up
the bank on the other side. This
tug-of-war replaces the sandbng bat»
tlc which was held last year, and the
nllrnlgllt manhunt which had pre-
viously taken place between the two
classes.

House chairmen acted as referees
for today’s tussle.

SlavikT-Iayclen
Yearling Stars
in Tilt Friday

Pioneers at Kohawk Goal
'as First Half Ends
Without Score

Slavik, slim, shifty Coe college
freshman quarterback. and Hayden.
sturdy Grinncll fullback. led their
yearling elevens through to a stab
tie on Ward field last night. These
two men were the consistent ground
gainers of the contest.

The visitors had all the advantage
early in the game but late in the half
a doryard sprint by Hayden put Grins
nell near the line. A spot pass Went
to the nine yard line and Hayden
plunged to within ﬁve yards of a
score when the gun stopped the
drive.

_ Coe Scores

Coe scored late in the third qudr~
ter. a recovered fumble in midfield
paving the way. Slavik found his
way through the center of the line
for 20 yards and then drove off
tackle to the cight»yard,mark. He
slashed off left tackle for the touch
down. his pass for the extra point
failing.

Grinncll started its drive from the
kickoff. passing to midfield just as
the quarter ended. Hayden plowed
to a first down and Fim followed
suit, the two of them battering away
to‘the 11-yard stripe where the Ko-
bawks held for three downs. A
lateral pass to Hayden brought the
score. his plunge for the extra point
being stopped.

CDe Threatens Onoc

The little Pioneers made another
threat late in the contest after hold-
ing Coc for downs in the middle of
the ﬁeld. A 002 back intcrcepted
Grinnell’s pass on his own 10»yal‘d
stripe as the gun sounded, however.

The visitors seriously threatened
only once. that in the first quarter
after Slavik recovered a Grinnell
fumble. The Goo aggregation car-
ried the oval to the Pioneer 20»yard
stripe, but were stopped when Hay-
den recovered a fumble.

McMillan smr

Scintillatlrlg runs by Slavik and
Hayden kept the game from becom-
ing uninteresting. The local outfit
showed plenty of versatility and pow-
er bus missed many tackles. McMil-
lan, Pioneer center. was the class of
both lines as he stopped most Coe
thrusts in that direction.
