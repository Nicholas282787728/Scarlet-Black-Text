“S’ WONDERFUL”-

By Bill Murphy
Christmas eamc Tuesday, Jan.
5 {01 the 23 men who had been
living in Darby gymnasium since
the beginning of the semester

On that date 0.th moved from
their vast and drafty quarters
to the newly finished and finely~
appointed Langan addition Form-‘
erly the smallest of the mens
halls Langatn now houses 67. i

“We call it Langan annex",
Donn Chattel‘ton, freshman, Said,
“but no matter what you call it,
the place is wonderful."

Sixteen of the men are living
in singles, four in two double
rooms, and three in the one large
suite, Mrs. Zella Grieve, Langan‘
housemother, explained. l

“I still get up in the rooming
and reach for the water pipes to
get my clothes.” Chatterton added.
“We just can’t get used to have
ing closets, and lighted ones at
that."

Large and well- lighted, thei
rooms are heated by a forced airi
system which insures good ventil-‘
,ation and uniform temperaturei
The new desks and dressers, fin-l
ished in tan enamel, fit in well
with the crcam walls and highly
polished woodwork.

Mostly freshmen, the Langao
addition men are warned by the
envious looks being cast their
way by upperelassmen, but Mrs,
Grieve assures them that prep<l
ping is over and that they have
nothing to worry about
