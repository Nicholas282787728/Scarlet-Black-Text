Nise, dean of
speaking or the agitation
regarding Sunday dates, yesterday,
said that there had beEn a great
deal at lalse thinking dnd hasty
conclusions on both sides. She wish-
ed that both sides oi the question,
he pl‘esellted'l‘nil'ly before any de-
cision was made. "It is a ques-

tion too, [or the Quadrangle girls

are not all'ect

“It the deei ion is made to have
Sunday dates." Mis De Nise stated,
“there will have to be some re»
striction or week dates. There DPDTP
ably would he delinite hours for call-
ing on Sunday. But, oi course that
would be in the hands or the selt
government league."

“Public Opinion is Not sci-orig"

Asked it the cessation of all
rules about dates except the restric-
tions or common sense and public
opinion would pl'ovesatisfwctory,Miss
De lee said she did not think pub—
liv opinion was strong enough here
to govern conduct. “Rubll'c sopin-
ion is not even as strong as it was-
while 1 was in‘ college. i wish
heartily that it were."

“Allowing Sunday dates would
break up the unity of the cottage
and quadrangle life," Miss Dc Niite
said in discussing the point that
the present situation gives the girls
an opportunity to develop their col—
lege tile in a co—educatiulial college.

“Many or the uppel‘rcluss girls
who have really considered the mat»
ter seriously and balanced the argu~
niciits for both sides of the Clues»
tion, are against Sunday dat'es,”.
“its the opinion of one at the house

. council Opposes Rule

Sentiment among the student
council members is decidedly
against the present Sunday date
rule, as expressed in a set of res—
olulious adopted last night reconr
mending the abolition oi the pres:
cut rule as a "vast and in idious
menace to tire wholesome growth
of Gl'lnnell's democracy,‘ a hind-
mine to that “pure democracy and
niaiorlty rule" which it iould pl'e»
vail in all her social life."

A student council member stat—
ed in a recent interview that the
resolutions .as adopted were the
natural outgrowth or the recent re»
ierenduni vote taken which was
“overwllelllllngly for the abandon-
ment oi the Sunday date rule."

Tire resolutions as adopted
were recouuiiended to be presented
lo the iaculty as a whole within
the next three weeks
