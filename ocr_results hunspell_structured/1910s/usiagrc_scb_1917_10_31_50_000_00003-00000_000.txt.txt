Look at the proposition from the

or course the men can stand it!
won‘t hurt'thcm a hit! To be sure
the women will always realize when
they have reached the limit ol their
endurance and take heed!
doubt you can have social attnli-s on
Fri ay, Saturday and Sunday and not
lie fatigued Monday. Griiiricll will
have a greater percentage of A‘s when
she has Silndayi dates. Without :1
doubt them “ill be fewer ncrvou
breakdowns and lcss sickness Logic
nl, isn’t it? Dali}!

Now, how about democracy “"1

you have any more democracy niter

crntic thing? Don't in take lndlvith

The way the question was stared or.

he was voting [or dates all day Slilir

meant by Sunday dat 7 Pray whv
uns the election staged in such hastc:
Was the council atrnid that it it was
put ott' till the students had time to
think that it would not carry? And
then is it dcmociatic to have an ind'
vidual march you up to thc ballot ho.
stand over you, watch you mark yoi

Democracy in the student body
“People who live in glass house,
should not throw stones."

Think, (loli't "fccl'"! Will Sunday
