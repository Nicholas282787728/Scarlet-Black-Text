1315 TEAM

(Culltllttcll Il am Pﬂyc 1)

The tcam was still lurthcr handicap»
pcd by having only one pitcher ,tn-
dot on has uphold thc hrwut oi thc
work in a very lining manner. As
most oi the gums came close togcthcr.
the captain was ioreod to worlr bc-
iore receiving suliicicnt rcst, but this
he did without a word of protest.

in the last game at tho season the
tour seniors ended thcir collcgiaic ed

with great honor. Macy's clever

, has rcsponsiblc lor onc oi the
two runs, while Far ell polcd a long
t\\‘ocllziggel‘ that brought in the other
run. “Dutch" Ulicll made a name
tor himsclt, by robbing the Iowa mcn
oi hits when hits would have startcd
a scoring rally.

Andy got swect revenge tor the dc.
feat at tirinnell last week and ended
his bnscball Career at Gliiinell lly der
renting one of the best teams that ever
l‘epresellt'etl.lolla “."U

hlucll credit is due Matuiill Fisher
tor the manner in which he developed
tlle team this year. Because or the
disastrous season i -t i-car, thc sched-
ule was reduced to eight games, one or
which was canccllcd because or bad
weather. Had Griiiuell pimed the
wcahcr colleges. she would have uir
doubtediy ﬁnishcd higher than our
other collcgc team, as tar as per cent
was contained.

Cornell was doiented twice and Con
ncll won mole games than any other
team in the conieioncc, tberciore
(lrinncll has an ctlual claim to Conlcr-
cncc honors.

Prospects ior nevt year are better
than ercr beiorc. Little, chcrcide,
and Tomliusou will remain in the in.
ﬁeld with quud and McCullough in
[he outhcld. At odd times thc nrcsh-
men won over the 'varsitr and showcd
consistent baseball.

Fisher sums up the prospects io'c
newt year when he rcmarlied that it
he could have uScd the Freshmen
this year he would have had as good
a tcam as Ever rcprcscntcd Giinilell.
