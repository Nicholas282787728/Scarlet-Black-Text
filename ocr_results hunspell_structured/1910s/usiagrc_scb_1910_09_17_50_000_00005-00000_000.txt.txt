The gi-utilring growth of the school
of Music is one or the llotnble features
of this year's ﬁgures, anti the large
number or last year's Freshmen who
have returned is also a matter or note.
In a. week or two the correct ﬁgures
will no doubt show that the college is
in a decidedly prosperous condition
as for as numbers are concerned.
