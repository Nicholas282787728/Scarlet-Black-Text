Do You Think:
You Are Headed Right.

Things Happen Now.

- The Gﬂnneu Review Fills
a Real Need.

l _. ,
Tomorrow is the time appointed by

custom when we climb to some high ‘

mental peak to review the path trav~
ersed during the past twelve months
and pick out the course for the twelve
to come.

In the held or athletics the intent
of the Missouri Valley Conference has
cast aside his baby clothes and has
pravan his worthiness to bear the fun»
ily name on gridiron, basket ball ﬂoor
and cinder track. ‘

The faculty has been enlarged and

strengthened. Bcttcr equipment has
been supplied, especially in the scir
ence departments.
. Looking forward, the thing we see
ﬁrst is probably (urthest away—grad-
uation. But that day depends upon all
those which precede it. Now is the
time for all those who have unsatis-
factory marks to make good resolur
tions and stick by them. Otherwise
they will have to substitute a vain re-
gret tor a diploma.

A basketball season lies ni thei m—
mediate loregrouud. Those “1' h D
can point to their record of unwavelu
ing support of the team during the
football season just past can do no
better than to continue in Lhe way
they have followed. All others should
urgently request themselves to help
to make the basketball team which
will represent Grinnell this year, a
winner from the start to the finish of
the season.

And alter taking this glimpse into
the future the next thing is to remand-
her that the present is the tuture of
the past, Ask yoursclt the question.
“Am r alive?” I: you are living in the
future or from the past you might as
well be dead. Things happen now.
A lump or coal has clogged the
wheels of higher education for several
weeks and the machine has just been
put in running order again. The thing
of vital interest at the present moment
is to get hack to the place where Work
as quickly and

was broken oil

smoothly as possible. A
amount of time is always lost in get-
ting up momentum. Too much time
has already dropped from the college
calendar. Every minute from now
until the end or the year is doubly
Precious.

The great present need is for fat:—
ulty and students to get down to seri-
ous business immediately.

——G——-—
How sordid to think a lowly and

material thing such as coal could Put
a stop to all the inspiring theory of 8.
college. it seems to be a true it some.
times unrecognized fact that this is a
material world

A liberal arts college especially has
a. tendency to cast an unreal light over
the practical things of everyday exist-
~anca while it idealizes theory.

Both are necessary but theory is
subordinate to materialism. Theory
is valuablein 'so far as it leads to the
development of the material.

The college student who knows well
the theory of banking Will make more
of a success, other things being equal,
than his brother without the theoreti—
cal training. But he must also be
able to tell the difference between a
silver dollar and a gold brich.

A new race has shown itself among

the hoary heads of Grinnell publica
tions. The new Grinuell Review has
emitted its ﬁrst infant cry.

The cry was full of vigor and gives
promise of a rapid development.

The Review seeks to be a literary
mouthpiece for the middlewest.

In this it will ﬁll a need which has
been long felt in Iowa and her neigh-
bor states. Heretofore we have pro-
dnced cnrn, not magazines. We are
given to under-stand that many persuns
living in other parts or the conntry
think of us only as a district of farm-
ars with no higher aesthetic scnsibili
tics than the appreciation at a good
hog house.

We, who are here know that such
is not the case.
for example, has produced many men
who stand high in America and world
literary circles. We must also admit
that these men have not remained to

A HY TONIC.
(From The Michigan Daily)

Once upon a time there Was a
young man in a strange city. It was
Sunday, and he felt lonely and fricnd-
less. He thought of the ones he loved
at home many miles away. They
were probably getting ready to go to
church. it he were home he would
go to church also. But he wasn't at
home; he was in this strange city
where no one cared for no one.

Finally, however, because there
was nothing else ti) do, he went for a.
Walk. He met people on their way to
church and from strength of habit
dually wandered into the open doors
of a small chapel. He took a seat in
the new nearest the door because he
might want to slip ouL This Was-
n't his church. He was a stranger and
therefore out of place. The man sit-
ting next to him smiled at him, but
he scarcely recognized the friendly
look.

When the ﬁrst hymn was sung, he
stood with the others, but the song
was not one which he knew.
n‘t like church at home. He was an
outsider, so why should he sing. Then
he hearthlie man next him Whisper
“When you are in Rome, boy, you
should do as the Romans do, Sihg."
And 1 corner of the hymn book Was
pushed into his hand. He felt the

back at the man beside him. As he
sat down he relt more at case than
at ﬁrst. There was an atmosphere of
invitation about the pews, the altar,
and the whole interior which he had
not sensed betore. When it came time
for the next hymn, he was among

When thc service was ﬁnished, he had
forgotten his loneliness, and the rest
or the day was brighter—all because
of a song.
