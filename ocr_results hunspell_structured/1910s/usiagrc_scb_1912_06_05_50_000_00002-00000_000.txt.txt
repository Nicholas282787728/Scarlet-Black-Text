A FINAL GREETI ‘0.

n th this issue the present manage-
mcin completes its Work tor the year,
and the commencement number Will be
in charge of the new editor and than
ager, Messrs. Appleby and Russell.

We do not wish to leave our post
without sincerely thanking our readers
for what has been a remarkably satis
factory attitude. The subscribers to
The Scarlet and Black have been very
generous with their praise and. if there
has been it great deal of hostile criti-
cism, it has been religiously withheld
from our ears, Folks have apparently
realized the problems and difﬁculties
or the situation, have been apprecia-
tive of our eitorts, responsive to sug-
gestions, and lenient with our lailings.

It the paper has achieved any de-
gree of success this year, it has been
largely due to a loyal constituency and
a decidedly etiicient body of regular
staff members. The inadequate time
and opportuni - oi the editor to revise
the “Cally" as it is turned in results
in the paper being peculiarly the con
tributions of the several individual
writers,

New year‘s readers should be cone
gratulnted on the prospects of a caro
fully edited, lire and sanell'rmanaged
paper under the new management.
Both Mr. AllPlelly and Mr. Russell are
eminently qualiﬁed to give the paper
a good tone and it is certain that
they nill print the news in a manner
worthy of the institution ultose events
it records.
