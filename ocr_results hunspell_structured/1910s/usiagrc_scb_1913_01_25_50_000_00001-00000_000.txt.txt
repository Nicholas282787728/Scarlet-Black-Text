POWERFUL ADDRESS AT Y.

“The Ultimate Choice" in Life
Discussed by Dr. Steiner.

”UNSELFISHNESS” IS THEME

"We Have No Right to Surrender

Our Souls to Business.”
\

Dr. Steiner, in a deep, act under-
staudnhle nay, addressed the Y. M.
Thursday evening on "File Ultimate
Choice.”

Dr, Steiner began with a row r

niarlts concerning lllosc limit) s in hie
about which we can eVCiL no l'lioll‘c
or three great things, heredity, err
viroiiint-nt and will. the ﬁrst two iii-e
prodctevmintd l'or tis hilt the will pl-
a ll'elllmltlolls bait \\'c are all cone
sr‘iolis at tho t’nct that we want to do
iiiiiigs Our will is an individual wrtli
delegated honors, in the rtipuhlic ol‘
the ptrsoii. it is the tictitit-e energy
at (iod nithrii us.

”'l‘lil‘t'c thi help us in our thoiccs,
education. etbits, and i'nliglon. Tile
ﬁrst teaches us to thoose the valuable,
the sccoiid to distinguish the good “'01“
the bad, and the third the eternal item
the tailipoial "

Dl'. Steiner emphasized the llillloi'lr
once oi our choice in coming to ('oL
loge and that our determination should
he sharpened by our exlwriollces here,
He said: “in your pl'ull‘sslon you have
to make good, Success means that you
giie the world more thrtn you receive,
Some of illt‘ world's greatest itiilui-es
have been its greatest successes. ii
Plato should return to earth he would
not want to see out niodern appliances
btit the Christian soul. By that he would
measure our slit‘t‘r‘ss iii liie. \\’e have
no righl to go into arty business which

choose nltciher we will serve (‘rod or
hiaiiimon. the prescnt generation or
ourselves, ‘l'le that stelieth his l a
shall lose it and he that loseth his
lite shall find it ’ " ,

nr. Steiner is piobablt at his best
in these little licart-torlicart talk.
This was Cortaiilh’ trite 'l‘hiirstlai Evens

lieareis a feeling that the evening
