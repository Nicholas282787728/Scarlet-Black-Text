Belscamper Heard
Ill Piano Recital

Miss Genevieve Helscamper gave a
most successful piano recital yester-
day afternoon in Herrick Chapel. The
most remarkable part of the recital
was the apparent ease with which she
played. Her playing had that cer-
tainty of touch which showed much
time spent in preparation.

The trio by Haydn in which she was
accompanied by Professors Pierce and
Peck, on the cello and violin, was es-
pecially good. The last movement of
the second number fas the best of that
group, and the ﬁrst part of Beetho-
vcnls‘Sonata op. 14, No. 2 was superior-
in the last group.

There will be a recital nearly every
day next week by classes and meme
bers of the School of Music. The
dates so far arranged for are as fol-
lows:

Monday—Chapel, 4:45—Grace Scary,
piano. ‘

Tuesday—Forum HalliMlldl‘ed Will
