Norman Hall, Gl‘lnllell's representa-
tive in the ﬂying forces abroad, ﬁgured
in a sensational air combat a lew da '5
ago, according to dispatches just re-
ceived irom the trout. Hall and three
associates ol the Lafayette Dscadrille
engaged at a dilly lieight two German
aeroplanes which were evidently en.
edged in photographing, The action
started at a height of 3.7 miles. The
Germans did not see Hall and a com—
panion, who ﬁrst attacked them, until
the allied livers were right upon them.
Hall and h s companion dived for the
Germans simultaneously and opened
tire with their machine guns at a dis—
tance of 230 feet, ﬁring about 100
shots apiece. The Germans turned and
headed [or home. Hall stayed below
them and his companion went above.
They attacked the rear machine at the
same time from above and beneaui.
while both German machine gunners
were shooting wildly. At about to
shots apiece hoth guns of the allied
dyers stuck. One Geirnan gunner had
sunk down in the cockpit wounded, hiit

, the pilot was unhurt and the machine

was under‘ control.

A little later two more members or
the Lafayette Dscadrille came up and
joined the attack and soon the machine
gunner in the other machine was put
out of commission, His helmet tell on
and was later round in a ﬁeld with a
bullet hole through it. Then the guns
of the two new arrivals also stuck, and
not one of the six machines in the at-
fray had-a gun available. The allied
airmen tried to keep the Germans from
landing in their own lines and follow-
‘ed them down aniid a storm of shot,
but the wind was too strong and in
spite of all they could do the Germans
landed safely. »

USE “NON- SKIDS” \VHEN
MOUNTING LIBRARY STEPS
Unlockers to the slips and slides
down the library steps advocate nun-
skid arctics as a safety-ﬁrst sugges-
tion. Since the packed snow has
turned to ice on the steps, more than
one has found that "pride gocth before
a fall.” The acrobatic stunts are a
constant source of delight to the urn
lockers; that is, until the onlooker he-
comes the actor. Sto ! Look! Jump!
Saves many a bump!

Many of the old timers in college
and town will regret to learn of the
death of J. W. West, of the class of
'77. His death occurred on Christmas
'Day.

“Bob" Lcc won his letter in baseball
and played class basketball in addi-
tion. As a baseball player he was one
or the best hitters on the squad and
covered the ﬁeld around second base
with due credit.

Although “Shorty" Herman has
played class basketball, he has had to
contciit himself with a good high
school reputation in athletics. An iii-
jury suiterod their has made it iinpns
siblc for him to try for a place on a
Grinnell varsity team. The very fact
that “Shorty” played on the Beatrice,
Neh. H. 3. team with “Dick" Scliul .,
Jesse and "Bill" Day, is sulficicitt evi~
deuce of his abilities along such lines.

"Shorty” has done his “bit" in an-
other way. He earned a po

“PiBATES ’AHE BUMING

Ellis Will Present Tulicful Opera,
“I’ll’lttes of I’cllztmce," January
211 and 24

(From Grinnell Herald.)

On January 23d and 24th, the Elks
will present to Gi-ionell lovers of mu.
sic and fun, their annual entertain-
ment. The production this year will
be the "Pirates oi penzance" by Gil-
bert and Sullivan, the sameanthors
who wrote the better known comie
operas, “Pinufore” and “The Mikado."
Many criues say that these authors
put theirprettiest and best music into
"The Pirates of Penzanee," and it is
sure they have made a hit ith the
fun and frolic of this composition. At
least we may be sure that any comic
opers‘byithese authors will have such
merit that it will please any audience.

A further guarantee oi this success
in the mind of the Grinnell public is
the list of principals who will sing the
prominent parts as shown by this
cost.

Major General, Philip Kelieher.

Frederic, 0. 3. Matthews.

Mabel. Leo Underwood.

Samuel, Louis Hartson.

Ruth, E. s. Evans.

Pirate King, waiter Weaver,

Police sergeant, A. c. Lyon.

Kate, Fred Morrison.

Edith, Geo. Walker.

Isabel, B, J. Richer.

These, with a chorus of twenty pi-
rates, ten police and sixtcen girls will
surely produce some music and inn.

0: interest also is the tact that on
Jan, 25th the opera will be given in
the big y. M. c. A. auditorium at Camp
Dodge, as a tree entertainment for the
soldiers. One other out of town date
may also be filled.
