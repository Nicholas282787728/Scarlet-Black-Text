All-round Work.

In tiie triangular debate between
Gi-iiiiicll, Coe and Cornell, Wednesday
evening. the local affirmative team
lost to Coe here by a 2 to 1 decision.
ivhile the Grillucll negative defeated
Cornell at blt. Vernon by the same
vote of the judges. Coc's affirmative.
which met Cornell at Cedar Rapids,
was given the decision there also by a
2 to 1 vote.

The debate here between Crinnell
and Coe was very close and hotly cone
tested, and aroused much interest in
the audience of three hundred people
who more than half filled the auditor-
ium of the new Alumni hall.

Armstrong Is Best.

Grinnell was represented by Frlde
lund, Palmer and Parker. The Coe
team was composed of Armstrong, We-
ber and Derbyshire. Parker made the
best constructive speech for Gi-innell,
although nearly equaled by his toani~
mates. Fridlund easily excelled in re
buttal. Palmer’s keen analytical reas
oning was effective in refutation.
Armstrong was easily the star for Cue.
His e, cmporaneous speech and stel-
lar rebuttal work brought victory for
the Crimson and Gold team. Weber,
too, was strong.

The Affirmative Case.

In the affirmative constructive case
Parker, the first speaker, proved the
necessity for compulsory arbitration.
He cited the threatened railway strike
last summer as an example of how a
tie-uh of transportation threatens the
very existence of the public. Palmer
followed with a strong argument justi-
fying the adoption of such a measure.
He pointed out that it was just to the
employer, cmploye and general pub-
lic. Fridlund closed the affirmative
constructive case by proving that com-
pulsory arbitration is practical.

Arllih tioil Is Question.

The question used was stated: “Re-
solved, That a permanent board with
compulsory powers should be estab-,
lished by Congress to arbitrate and‘
settle disputes between steam rai -
roads doing an interstate business and‘
their employes, constitutionality eon-
ceded."

Mr, W. C. Ray acted as chairman,
and the committee of award included!
Prof. N. A. Brisco, of Iowa university,
Prof. C. H. Mcryerholz, of State Teache
ers college, and Prof. C. M. Case, of}
Penn college. i

Win At Cornell.

At Mt. Vernon. the Grinnell negative
team composed of Armbrustcr, Meek
and Miller defeated the Cornell trio
composed of Walker, Whitehead and
Mathews by a 24 decision. Grinnell'
won because she surpassed in analy—-
sis, direct argument and delivery. The
Cornell team placed the emphasis on
theory, while their opponents used the
practical argument.

The honors for the Grinncll men-
werc fairly well divided. Each man
spoke with a clearness and effective-
ncss which carried conviction. The
rebuttal and main speech of Mathews
was the outstanding feature of the af-
firmative case,
