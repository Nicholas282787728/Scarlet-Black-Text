Upon entering this country the goats
w’l be taken direct to a term near
Sioux City where a permanent goats
raising industry is to he established.
This enterprise has the sanction and
help ot the U. S. Department or Agri-
culture.

There is a big tlcniaiid throughout
the country for goat‘s milk tor invite
lids and babies, hecaiise it can he die
gested so much more easily than cow's
milk. However, these men will not
tackle the dairy business but will con-

soats. Goat-raising business has
never been undertaken on so large a
scale in this country before. One of
the reasons is the inconvenience and
expense of the long quarantine period.

Mr. DeHatuJ, who has been very ac-
tive in Gl'inncllAin-China, had his ﬁrst
experience with goats as a commercial
preposition, while in China. Since his
return to this country he has experi-
mented further along the same line.
While in a bank at Laurel, Nebl'., he
kept seine goats in his back yard and
was very successful with them.

With Mr. DoHaztli’s experience and
faith in the goat industry the above
partnership was formed, and its doc
velopmeut will he watched by inter-
ested people all over the country.
