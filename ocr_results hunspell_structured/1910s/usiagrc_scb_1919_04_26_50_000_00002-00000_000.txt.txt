AL several recent college gatherings

Dancing, like any other form of
amusement, can be carried to the ex—
treme, But a system of faculty supa
ervisioii, regulating the number or
the time of dances, would render this
impossible.

With the introduction of dancing
into practically all the high schools
of the state, the high school graduate
naturally takes the social life of his
or her contemplated college into con-
sideration hefore making the ﬁnal
choice. If the college has a dead relin-
tation socially, score one point against
that college in the estimation of that
graduate. Grinnell has an attractive
academic life,——she is second to no
other institution in that respect, But
it is up to Grinnoll to furnish an equal-
ly attractive social life if she is to
bring the highest class of students
within her doors. In furnishing this
social life, she has failed.

A series of informal dances at fre-
qnent intervals thruout the year or
for a short time after certain meetings
of various organizations, all supervised
hy the faculty, would do much toward
unifying and perfecting college fellow—
ship, and would be a real attraction
to prospective students of Grinneli.

After reading some of our exchange
college paper's, We have come to the
Louclusion that the Grinnell preps
rought to be thankful that no dandelion-
digging tradition has ever been estab-
lislmd on our campus. The Daily Kan»
San says that “if any one has a good
idea of eternity it should be the fresh.
