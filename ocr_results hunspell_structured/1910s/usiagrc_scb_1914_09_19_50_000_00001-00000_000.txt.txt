This 'ear is marked by the fact that
there are no large rooming houses for

“Shack", no house has nlm'e than a
dozen girls,

The Brock hcusc, formerly one of
the largest girls' houses, is being run
by the loan who live there. They
have been drawn from the small
houses of last year, and have selectedl
Mr. Dickerson as House Adviser.

The Preston house still remains the
largest ol the nuns houses. There
are twenty rooming there, and sixtocn
at the Brock house, while there are
only thirteen at the Rust. house.

Tile men at the Preston house are
Middleton, Wait . chols, Swan, Flynn,
Kirkpatrick Miller, Merrill, Barrett,
Hollowav, Graham, Thompson, Swln-e
ner, White, Witter-s. and Sever-side.

of the college live in a house contailr
ing ten or more men.
