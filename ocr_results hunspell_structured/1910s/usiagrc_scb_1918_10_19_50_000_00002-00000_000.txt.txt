There is an old adage to the street
that, "We never miss the water till the
well runs dry.” in a sense, this maxim
might lie applied to our chapel service.

Many Grinncll students and some
taciilty members are accustomed to at-
tend chapel only when it is conveni-
ent for them to do so and others ncver
attend at all.

During the iiast week, however,
there has hecn‘ no chapel .scrvice,
Those people who were wont to attend
only at iiitcrvals, are now realizing
what an important place the chapel
service holds in Grinnell life.

And those who are accustomed to go
to chaﬁel regularly are feeling the loss
still more keenly.

This sci-vice lneans many things. To
some of us. it means tellowship. i'er
laxation; to others, it means spiritual
stimulus, intellectual growth. What-
ever it oinhodies the day which has
not had at least ﬁfteen minutes given
over to such a service, seems differ
out, it seems as it something were
lacking.

Since we are now doing
chapel and thus realize what an essen-

tial part 01 our lives it constitutes,“

there is reason to believe that when
once the service is resumed, th
dents and faculty members will 1 l—
rcst a new and keener desire to give
the chapel service an important place
in their lives.
