'Ag‘ree That Military Uniforms
Would Add Snap and Dig-
nity to the Drill

EXPENSE IS BIG PROBLEM
CONNECTED WITH PROJECT

Suits Might Be Worn Both to
Classes and to Drill, One
Man Suggests

The question of obtaining uniforms
for the drill work in oriiineli is one
which is at the present time causing
a great deal of concern among the
school author ies and among the men
themselves. any solritioirs have been
offered by re ous people at one time
or auotlier, but all of these suggess
tions have been found unable to meet
the present situation.

If one is to judge it n the opinions
of the different officers, it seems to be
a generally conceded fact that drill
uniforms are very desirable. The
opinions of a few of the officers are
printed below.

LieuL Arthur Clliltlil think that all
non-commissioned officers should get
the uniforms and if possible all the
privates. It would make the drill
more snappy and improve it greatly.

Sergeant lint-ire ~Unifoi'llls would
improve drills 100 a. They should be
worn to classes as well as to drillsi
it is being done in other colleges.

Sergeant linker—All nonrcommISr

sioired officers should have unifor
It would give them a more command
ing air.
, Sergeant Preslmli informs would
add interest to' the training and also
would make the drills moi-c impres-
sive.

Sergeant KellyiThcy should l‘cr
quire uniforms of all underclassrncn.

Sergeant Ellswortliiml men should
have uniforms. A fund should be es-
tablished by on college for immediate
payment. In this ivay the men could
pay for them in monthly installments.

Sergeant ll'ilcox‘en—liniforms would
add greatly to the snappihess of the
drill. It would be better to have all
men in uniform, but if this is impos—
sible'llniformerl officers would help
very much.

Sergeant McCormwliﬁl am strongly
in favor of uniforms. They will im-
prove the drill and give it a serious
attitude, a quality which has been de-
eidedly lacking

Corporal Osiiicup—All the other coir
logos and universities have them; why
not Grinnell?

Conlorlll FrillluutI—Every man in
college should be in uniform. The
uniforms can be worn both to classes
and drill.

Corporal Dllcliworﬂliljniforms can
be bad at small cost and no doubt
would add much to the pop and smart
ness of the drills

UUINTET SHDWS REAL
PEP IN PREPARATION
FOR DRAKE TDNIGHT

Team and Coach Work Together
to Secure Better Offensive
and More Speed

ENTIRE SQUAD IN SHAPE
TD BATTLE THE BULLDOGS

Lineup May Be the Same as That
Which Faced Carleton
Last Week

. Vllh the ﬁrst game of the season a
thing of the past. the Grinncll lasket-
ball team has been putting ini - best
“licks" in preparation for a hard con—
lcst tonight when it meets the strong
Drake university quintet on the local
rloor. Both the team and the coach
have been doing their utmost to work
up a more polished offensive and to
inject more speed into the play.

The incn came out of the Carleton
in' ‘1) good shape and should be in
the best of condition when they enter-
the game with the university ﬁve.
“Dutch" Garner is the only man who
has received an iniuiy during the
strenuous week of practice and this is
of a minor characte Coach lliacnach-
ion has kept the shifty little forward
on the sideline for the last few days
and as a result he should be able to
enter the fray with Drake and play in
his a customcd form,

Iinnu Little of Drake Strength

Nothing definite can be learned of
the strength of the blue and white but
from the meager reports which have
been coming from the Drake comp it
is safe to say that they are coming to
the local floor prepared to break the
lioodoo which has followed them for
the past seasons whenever they have
lined up against the local collegiaus.

The visitors will be at an advantage
in having played more games so far
this season and should be able to pre-
sent their greatest strength The
Drake team made a rather disastrous
trip last week, losing three straight
games, but the teams which they play-
ed were the class of the Missouri Vale
ley conference and the results do not
furnish much basis for dope.

Lille-Up Is Uncertain

It is possible that the same five men
who played against Carleton will take
the ﬂoor tonight when the iii-st whis-
tle blows. This aggregation showed
great possibilities and deserves the
consideration which the coach has giv-
cn them.

The forward positions will undoubt—
edly be taken care of by Hammond
and Garner, as both displayed real
ability in their ﬁrst intercollegiate
game. Somers is the only man who is
sure of getting into the contest at the
same position which he played against
Carleton.
