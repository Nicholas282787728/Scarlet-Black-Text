low college, or at some other city or

would not he as acute as it i. at tliel
present tune.

in a laiily large western ci , the
community has ‘a social lile which is
usualh open to the students or the
college located there, The theaters
hare a class of crrtcrtauiriiclit, and a
variety or entertainment, that appeals
to students. Social ol‘gamzallons ln‘
the city have series or parties, dinners,
and dances, which take the place to a
large extent of strictly' college affairs 1

Grinnell college has always consid-
ered its location in a small city the

able. While it has been admitted that
larger cities ortcr certain advantages,

As far as social liie is concerned,
howerer, the cit oi Gl'lnliell does not

ordinary dances held are hardly of a
type to appeal to college students.
Practically all that is left is the mov-

Movies are all you poll in their-
place. lint they are hardly worthy of a
commanding position in Gr-innelrs sole

It would seem, then, that it was the
college's place to provide for a large
part of the social hie of the students,
or at least permit the students to
work oiit their own social problems
