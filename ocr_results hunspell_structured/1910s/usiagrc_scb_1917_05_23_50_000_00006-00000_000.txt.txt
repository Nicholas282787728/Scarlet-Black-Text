“"11 next Saturday's number as‘
their iii-st isiic a new Editor and
Business Manager will be in charge
ot The Scarlet and Blaci ll Don
Clark is the new Etlitolrlu-cllicf alld‘
Richard Bridlong the new Business‘,
Manager.

Both men came into their positions
with the best ot qualiﬁcation M .
Clark has been prominent in local‘
newspaper circles for some linie. He
has shown his news writing ability
in connection with the News Bill-call
during the past year. Administl'as‘
live dualities hare been shown as etllv
tor of tho Grinnell Magazrne 'last tall.
His work as news editor ot The Scar:
let and Blaclt'has ivell as his cilorts'
as reporting editor on the slait, have
been of the highest standard. lie is
also a member oi the Board of Di~
rectors oi the new ion-a College Press
Association. With war cond' ons
prevalent he will have many se eus
problems ahead, but there is little‘
doubt in our- minds that he will silow‘
that he has plenty ot abi ty to cope
with them.

Mr. Budlong has been a member at
the staff tor a year arid a bait and has
been a news editor du mg the last
tcw weeks. While sci g as acting
Business Manager a few times this
spring he has shown that he
most competent man tor the posirion
of Business Manager.

To the new management ivc wish
the best or siicees. Their future is
one with many dithciilties and oh-
stacles. War conditions will present
serious problems and other which
always come in newspaper circles will 1
appear. yet there will be many- pleas—
ant experiences as well, We wish the
new management the best.

AN ADYAVCE. '

At‘t‘nc end of each car it has he-
oomo customary tor the paper to re-
view the condi cos of The Scarlet and
Black, in this year's statement it is
to be noted that The Scarlet and Black
has made many improvements which
have advanced it to a higher standard.
Better service than ever betore has
been given to the readers. The pnpcr's 3
specialty has been news. BY making'
the column one inch longer, twénty
inches or news space have been added,
to each issue, or a total et ovoi- Loon
inches (In no the year. Fifty—slip

which. added to the extra lcngth oi",

that the equivalent or twelve i ares]
was remarkable, but this year that'
amount has been more than doublcdi
