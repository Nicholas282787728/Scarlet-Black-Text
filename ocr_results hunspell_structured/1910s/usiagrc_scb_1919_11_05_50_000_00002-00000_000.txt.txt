Professor Jesse Macy has completed
the record of his life. It is a. record
which will inspire every true Grinnoll-

He has been identiﬁed with the col-

During these past sixty years he has‘,
devoted himself to the senlce of Lhei
college and mankind.

His own college course was inter-
rupted that he might serve his Wound—
ed comrades in the cause or lreedoiu
during the civil War.

Beginning his career as a teacher
on the college faculty in 1871 he has
given himself for the best interests
of the college since that time.

He is the personiﬁcation of the un—
dednable Grillrlell Spirit. In him was

JESSE MACY. AN APPRECIATION.

By Professor Charles Noble.

With the passing all Prolessor Macy We lose the visible presence of the
last survivor oil the group of teachers and administrators who laid the foun-
dations of our College in the seventies and the earlier eighties of the last
century. The Davenport period may be thought of as a prophecy oi the col-
lege that was later to come into being. The years before and during the Civil
War were the time of the infancy of Grinncll. The real foundations of the
Grinnell of today were lllld by Mdgoun, Farker, Macy, Buck, Brewer, Barnes,
Crowc and their associates in the Woi'k'of the college, from about 1870 to
1886 During the earlier part of this time Macy was doing foundation work
as Principal of the Grinncll College Academy; and during tho later ycars he
was, through his published writings and in his class room work, pioneering in
the new Economics and Political Science. Through his text books he was put-
ting the study of government into the public schools, and in both sides or his
activit was lifting the "dismal science” out of the region of dull abs 'actions,
and making it a vital study of human life and the relations 01' men to men.

The second period of Grinnell’s lil‘e may be called pro-eminently the period
of inspiration. All those connected with the college in the time of Gates were
conscious of a stir ng of the academic atmosphere. The personality of the
President was like a blast of [rash breeze across the prairie, and his associates
caught the inlectrcn. Macy did not need to catch this infection from any
one. He was abundantly ﬁlled with the “Grinncll Spirit“ while Grinnell was
still known as low College: This, the time from 1887 to 1906,-was the period
when he passed from national to international inﬂuence and reputation. He
was writing ”The English Constitution” and James Bryce was coming to him
for criticism and cooperation in the completion of h' American Common—
wealt f'

Though Professor Macy's career began with the foundation period and
endured through the period of inspiration, he was still essentially a young
man in sp' ' and energy when the college entered on its third epoch. that of
large expansion and development. As he had worked with Magoun, Gates
and Bradley; so he entered heartily into the broad plans and increasing activi—
ties of President Main. lie continued vigorously teaching and writing till
his retirement at the age of 70 in the year 1912;‘ and the years immediately
More than
any other man, Macy measures with his activities the life of the college,
illustrates the quality or its work as himself one of its products, and embodies
its spirit in the manner and effect of his work. V

A man of absolutely independent thought and action, he led his generation i

into new ﬁelds of study and life. A true democrat in theoly and practice, he
lelt a body of teaching in his published works which will serve as an admir—
able guide to the theory and practice of dmnoclatic government. A lover of
ills 'ce and his fellow men, he will he r'emelllbeled with affection by a wide‘
