in Two Hontlls~llnttuly
"Lilli" Rt-ilmtlt‘lltlll.

Upon returning to Grinncll students
have been struck. with the large
amount of construction and rcrnodeb

/ling work which has been done during

the summer. Not only in the College
but ill the town as Well there seems
to he at “'0“ defined era of building.

By the middle of November the new
Alumni Hall on the north campus will
be ready for occupationr Initial dc-
lays, late shipments or material, and
the impossibility of securing skilled
wo :nlen, are all r polisible for; the
tar ness itr its erection. Absence of
competent labor is the greatest dilfir
enlty. The larger cities of Iowa, as
well as Minneapolis and Chicago have
been appealed to for skilled workmen,
brrt without the most gratifying re-
sults.

It is the type or: structure, however,
that will tinish rapidly once the bare
walls are erected. Already the filmi-
turc and ti tures hare been ordered
and will arin-o by the fll'sL ol Nol‘ell‘ir
her with the expectation that the
building will be ready for use about
the middle or that month.

The Bailey-Marsh company, which
has charge ot the construction ot the
recitation building, has demolished the
former home.or pr sident Main and
tor two weeks have bccn bu ly ens
caged in the erection oi a new dwell-
ing. Tire construction will he eriii-
rrrc proot; brick walls and tile roof,
lint with wood ilooi-rirg,

A number oi improvements hare
greatly changed the appearance or the
Botany labor-atone The minor “Lab"
has a new tloo while diit'crcut
windows and a redecorated interior-
at the inruor room st rc to maintain
its ancient superiority over the Bass
teriology labor-amt , now graced with

plaster-cu waits. The campus
has had sereral sirleual - lincd across
its ways; wlirlc the Library is still to
be remodelled considerably,

New buildings arc in eiidencc on
every corner, on Firth i -cnuc the
new theater- and Herald iuulthiig it here
the “s. is B." will mnke its headquart-
ers- later in the tall, the modern lioirrc

it on the corner oi Fifth and Broad, a
$100,000 postoriice is in the trrst stages
of COHSU’IICLlon.

Ascl Prather, ’15}, and Clyde King,
’20, have taken over the Pal'l' Shining
Parlor east or Candylantl and have
opened up a shoe shining and clothes
pressing parlor, which they plan to
run iii addition to their college work.
“Shillclallil” is the name they have
given their new establishment, and
they plan to do high grade work and
give ftrst class so rice in crery re-
spect.

The expectation of the

perhaps the main let on tor the in-
cr-casc or three instrucic in the

Ph. D. from Chicago Ull ersrty, was
graduated from Simpson in who. lliss

Many sliitts harc liccn made in the
Work oi the old instructors. Froics-

sibility oi English A to .lir. Wallcser,

Mr. Gr-iilitlr will tahc Ell°llsh Lauv

Pl' c, it there are enough students
desiring the work to iorin a class.

A new thing is to he tried in the
Fl'cslilllan English dirrsion. Within
two \lcelts aitcr- the opening at school

e ill be gir i an examination, This
u l he the basis tor the selecting ot a
