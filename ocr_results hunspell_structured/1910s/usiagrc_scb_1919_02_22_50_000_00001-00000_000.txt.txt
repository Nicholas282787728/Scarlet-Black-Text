Is Principal Defect of
Huff's Men.

Amos comes here tonight to meet
Griiniell tor the ﬁrst time this year.
A return engagement will be played
at Antes on March 7, the day before the
indoor meet at Amos.

The local ﬁve has been woilting hard
in order to overcome their weaknesses
which have shown up in the past few
games. Laclt ot accuracy on short
shots and loose guarding were both
evident in the Cedar Falls game.

No change has been made in the
lineup and the same men will start'
who started in the last game. Dc Ruyr

the balance of the team._ Teamwork
has improved somewhat as a result
of the sci-imniages against the fresh
roan ﬁve during the last ten days.
Failure to make short shots is still
noticeable.

tied the score and caused an extra

award the past Week, but appears to
play a better game at the pivot posi-

as that of De Ituyter.

At the meeting ot the Y. W. Thurse
day evening Mr. K. C. Lee presented
eel-min impressions at America Tea
ceived by thc Chinese students.

In his opinion. more permanent good
can he done by sending students from
China to America than by sending mis-
sionaries to China because a student
here can see American Christian lite
as it really is.

"It is consequently." he said. “the
duty of American Christians to make
life here the kind that will be helpful
to foreign students."

‘EEAUTY CHORUS HIT OF

Ashby is ”Hard Boiled” Villain
In Melodrama Staged
By Four.

The revival of the custom of men's
stunts on the night or the colonial ball
proved to bc a great success last night'
when the vaudeville program given

The icotuic of the evening was the
musical comedy staged by Building
Five, which was perpetrated untler the
name or “Treat ilc Itough." The well—
ltnown song by Paul Stewart was used
by Roscoe Wright and his beauty
chorus.

The choius was composed of Meek,
Brown, Ramsey. Ducltwoi-tli, McCor-
Hack, Parker. Findlay and Ward. The
chorus ended up with an especially
touching ﬁnale.

The dressing race by Building One
was a speedy contest. Hutchinson and
Moore introduced Bochmler. Decker.

Marty and Weigen as contestants in a
race to see who could get dressed first

dicaps it proved to be an exciting race.
Building Six gave a stunt that was a
takcroil on a certain phase of doi-ini—
tory life which they called “Don’t Bite
TliC Hand That’s Feeding You." The
act scored a hit. especially the song at
thc end which was a parody on the
original interspersed with much local
humor.

Still Put-sited i-ier. in One Act and a

Ashby the villain. and Randall was the
leader or the Grecian chorus. The pro-

acting was exceedingly dramatic.
Building Three staged a wrestling

It has been suggested that Building
S and the only other party who
knows the secret of that durable anti
elastic rubber substitute start the
manufacture of same tor truclt tires
and apply the profits where they ai'el
most needed.

It is agreed that Building Five had
a “pony chorus." Altho the members
had shad considerable they were still
shaggy enough to withstand a long
spell of cold weather.

The quadrangle dwellers would do
well to consult members oi the "Trent
Me Bong " company in regard to
camouflage or face and ﬁgure.

There seemed to be Violent disagree
incnt between the individuals or the
chorus and the orchestra in regard to
the Drover Cadence.

Rules and regulations for dancing as
heretofore laid down were totally (lis-

 

rcgnrdcd at. the Colonial Ball.

It was a ﬁrolly dance but the bum
ol conversation together with the tem-
perature sllggastcd mosquitoes.

Last night's vaudeville would make
a pleasant evening's entertainment for
[he quadrangle.

Colonial Ballists report that dancing
oil the men’s gymnasium floor has its
ups and downs.
