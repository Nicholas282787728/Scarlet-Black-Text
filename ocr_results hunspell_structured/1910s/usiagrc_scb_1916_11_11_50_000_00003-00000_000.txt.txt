St, Louis finds its greatest tonnage in

business, grain contributes about 37
per Cent and products of mines 28 per
cent. Its western lines run into tire
grain fields of South Dakota, and its
southern rails enter the Iowa corn
country, and the lilinois coal ﬁelds.

“The sec line is mentioned as the
most probable purchaser. This road
reaches the Twin Cities, and Minne-

with the Wabash near Oskaioosn, In.
St. Paul has been suggested as a bids

two lines are parallel and competing
