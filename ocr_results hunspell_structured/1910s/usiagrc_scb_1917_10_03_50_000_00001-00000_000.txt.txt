GRINNELL BETTER
THAN HARVARD IL,
SAYS PRDF. SMILEY

Former Harvard Exchange Pro-
essor Prefers Local College
for Undergraduates

TDD MANY ACTIVITIES IN EAST

Thinks Opportunities for Distrac-
tion from Work Are
Less in Grinnell

That Grinncll is better than Han
yard for seven out of every ten men
of college age, and Just. as good lor-
the other three, is the opinioir of pr.
0. N. Smiley, professor of Latin, who
has just returned from a year's work
at the eastern university as the Hare
var-d cyclianse professor from Grirn
ilellt

, The great number of distractions
occasioned by the proximity of Conn
bridge to Boston, together with the
counties lines of college activity in
which the maiority of Harvard stri-
dents indulge are the principal reasons
for Professor Smiley-s belief Although
the average Grinuelhan has far too
many “irons in the tire," the opporturr
ity for this is eien greater- in the
east, and is a curse at any institution,
according to the G noell professor.
Frosli Gt-t Better Chi-e llcrc

Because or our faculty and student
advistory system, the lresninen are
much better cared for than at l-lar—
yard. They come into closer touch
with the faculty and upperclassmen
and in this way receive an inspiration
rvhiclr_wonld other-wise .

That an education's u d merely
in one section of the country is income
plete was another tatenrent expressed
during the interview. after getting a
degree from a college course in crin-
nell, every student should spend a
year in a fa- western or far castern'
univer 'ty, in order to become ace
acquainted with the different modes of
living, and to broaden his point of
view in this regard.

Harvard Likes Our Ilospitullty

, G lunell's hospitality was highly
praised by the entire Harvard faculty,
many of whom expressed a desire to
Professor Smiley to be sent west on
the exchange system, because of the
reports brought back by the more to
tunate members who had been in Grill-
nell.

Professor Smiley conducted a class
in Horace during his stay in Harvard

ond tenor section, all of last yea ,,
men having returned to school

The tiy-outcrs were all of a higir
quality th fall, and with the prob
ability of losing only two men by
graduation next ,lirne, prospects are

unusually bright for a club of high
standard for the next two years.

Won’t Study a

Dead Lauguage

Frosh Changes His Language
Registration from German
to French

“I don't waiit to study a dead
language!" ,

That was the argument of a Griir
nell freshman who appeared before
his adv sor yesterday and asked ior
permission to change his language
registration lrom “Deutscll” to “La
langue Franeaise,”

The professor allowed the change,
untl then went on to remark aborrt
the marked effect of the war upon
the number studying tirese lane
guages.

There are only tu'enlyrl'our stirs
dents in the beginning German
courses this year, while last year
the registration was fifty-two. Tire
war seemingly has little effect upon
the slud)‘ of advanced German, as
the major courses are of normal
size,

French has received the principal
increase froili the German depart-
ment, The enrollment in French
courses this year has smashed all
previous records by a wide margin.
Beginning French classes total two
hundred and sinv instead of one
iirriidrcd and fifty as last year.
while at the some time the attend-
ance in the advanced courses has
more than doubled.

Spanish also shows a marked in-
crease, Although freshmen have
been excluded from the beginning
courses, the enrollment is pl‘ﬂcﬁicnlr
ly as large as last year The lid-
yanced colllses have increased in
member-ship frorn nine to thirty.

soon laughter, screams for help,
and hanging of doors announced to
every one who was trying to sleep,
that :t Real Scrap had begun. Arter-
raiding the linen closet for sheets,
which made the best possible ropes,
the sophomores kept the freshmen
girls in their rooriis by tying all the
doors together.

Excited laces appeared above the
transoins and hand to hand corn»
bats were staged. One sophomore
girl was locked out for the night
by her freshman roommate and
was left to the mercy of her friends
for a place to spend the night.

Miss De Nise telephoned a
minute warning and the scrap ende

freed thc lreslimen in time for the
morning fray.

No casualties were reported!

Both Evans and Ladd, who were

the most severely injured combats
nuts, are said to be getting along
nicely,

Some of the participants in the
midnight skirmish have professed a
pl'olouutl dis he of green tomato
plants.

One hundred and twelve fresh-
men left the “Y” at 9:15 and made
their way to the fair grounds. They
paraded the main streets of the
busrness ‘ectl’oii ou tlielr way, and
indulged in a few yells.

The solid phalanx formation
which was used by the soplrs could

 

not stay intact very long under

the impact of the freshmen, but
some of the various units held to-
gether ior half the scrap.

Sonic mighty good prospects for
the track team next spring were true
earthed on sever 1 occasions during
the night. It is said that Evans,
Mchli'i'ay and Cass showed a Won»

and space between themselves and
their opponents.

The lrcshincn were served with
cats by their feminine compatriots

refreshments flu-‘ng the night, the
[rush indulging in hamburger and
coffee, and the sonhs satisfying
their inner men with "hot dogs"

The spirit which the freshmen
showed when the tide of battle turn-
