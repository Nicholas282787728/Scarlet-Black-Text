Gl‘ﬂllll March.

In celebration of George washings
Lou’s birthday, fair ladies were gal-
lantly escorted to the men's gymnasi»
uni Saturday night, for the annual
Gil'ls‘ Colonial Ball,

The party was, as usual, charming
with quaint costnming and stately
dancing. The ball was especially der
lightful this year because Miss Ander—
sen, the women's physical director.
was again present after her years
leave of absence.

Ilaiid Gym Too Small.

Because of the large number of
girls who wished to attend the dance
it was impossible to use the Rand
gymnasium any longer. With the oi»
chestra in one end of the men's gYul»
nasiuni, more roonti was left for the
colonial couples to circle about.

At 8 o'clock Miss Andersen led the
grand march with her escort, Kathei'r
iue Cox, president of the Women's Athr
letic Association, A long line of gen-
tlemen in powdered wigs with their
ladies beside them followed the leads
ers about the room.

Special Dances Featured.

Two special dances were featurcs of
the ball. The favorite miuuet was
given by the w. A. A. board, with Miss
Andersen and her assistant, Eva Hall.

Cal-onto, an interesting old Shakes-
pearean dance, by Constance Platt.
Marie Hilleary, Mildred Wilson, and
Eva Hall, with their escorts, Josephine
Hutchinson, Kathryn Cox, Beulah
Cleveland, and Bernice Wei-theim, was
very enjoyable. So vigoiously were
their efforts applauded that the danc-
ers bad to give an encore.

The usual number of fox-trots aiid
waltzes was enjoyed by everyone. The
ryc wftltz was a special favorite and
added variety to the program. The
firefly waltz was the most beautiful
one to watch, with glowing jos- sticks
in the powdered wiffures of the colon—
ial domes and the lights of the build
ing turned low.

The music for the evening, under
the direction of Mr. D. E. Peck, was
thoroughly appreciated by the dancers
and spectators.

011 IKUI’ES SI’LAI
AT CHAPEL TUESDAY

PROFL

“The New Testament was not meant
to be a crutch, but a vivifying breath
of fresh a‘ " This was the statement
made by From sol' James Hardy Ropes
in his chapel talk Tuesday morning,
on the subject, “The Application of
New Testament Teachings To SocioL
ogy."

The speaker pointed out that the
lilo is not a book of external autholu
ity, but one of supreme spiritual op
portunity. “Only as we give our hearm
to the appeal of ideals do we find its
absolute authority,” he said.

THAT “EARLY T0 RISE"
PROVE]!!! IS STILL TRUE
LN GRINNHLL AFTER ALL

Whether or not it pays to get up
early in the morning can well be seen
in the example of hard hiclr set by
George Stout. us, in connection with
Gl'mnell's latest scarlet fever case.
Monday morning Croft and Rumble,
both Freshmen, felt slightly ill. The
doctor was called and he pronounced
that both had scarlet fever.

Other members of the Jones house
had supposedly arisen and hetahcn
themselves about their daily taslts as
usual. But not so with Stout. He was
slumber-mg peacefully, and on await»
ciiiug found that a large yellow sign
was on the outside of the house and
he was on the inside. Except for a
short excursion to Dr. Spraguc, he
has been there since, and so has the
sign. The five roomers who had an?
on were out of doors, and out of reach
of needed equipment. The prospect
of being out of bed all night was also
very great, but their neighbors, the
Brock House, took them in.

Itis expected that Croft and Rumble
will he removed tonight: and that the
Jones l-louoe rooniers will be ailowed
to return to their accustomed place of
abode. Neither patient is very sick

and the loss of time is their wol’stl

trouble.

1105,

Voluntary chapel, dancing, mixed
tables and fraternities furnished the
subject of Pl'C dcnt llaiu's tall: before
a capacity chapel this morning.

"Sollle hundreds or you in the past
week have been voting that you don't
believe in voluntary chapel," said the
speaker in discussing that subject.
“You havcirt been here. I construe
that as a vote that you don't believe
in it. You have this chance to show
in a tangible way your loyalty to the
college, by giving fifteen or twenty
minutes 2. day to phl‘pcluatc its pur-
pose. It‘s: a small thing to give, it‘s a
tremendous thing in its significance."

Toward the question. of dancing,
President Main held a favorable atti-
tude, although he condemncd strongly
the indiscriminate dancing .that has
been going on by underhanded means.
He stated the steps were being ialten
to better the circumstances of the five
or seven vacation dances a year, but
did not commit himself a’s.to what
these steps might be. He expressed
himself as having entire faith in the
deciding of student problems by stu-
dents themselves. “I've never had a
fear of trusting this student body,
when once they've come to an under
standing of what the aim may be," he
declared.

In regard to frater es, he declared
himself entirely opposed to their es-
tablishinent in Crinnell. “Where no
provision has been made for housing,
the harmony has its place," lie stated.
but went on to say that Gl‘lllllCIL has
something better. He admitted that
the college authorities had been situdy‘r
ing the qncstion for years.

That mixed tables or boarding clubs

are not necessary iicre was another]

conclusion drawn by President .llaiii.
“Some of the best elements of edllcar
tion for men are obtained by fellow-
ship \viih nieli alone, and for women
with wometl alone," was his statement
on the Subject. “Gi-iiincll is n cocdir
catioiidl , logo for lllell.” A laigc
part of the social restlessness evident
this year he believed has a son from
the fact that the women have a social
center and the men as yet have none,
It Will disappear when the two centers
are complete.

There has been a conspicuous ab-
sence of the numerous stunts which
were given iii thc Quadrangle theater
last year, and for this reason it is be-
lievcd that the Y, W. entertainment
will be welcomed by many. Tickets

well as national loyalty.

At Top Speed.

mm the Iowa Conference title Luella
ed safely away. the Griiinell bashetball
team has settled down to the hard
struggle for state honors, and the first
obstacle to be overcome is the game
with Iowa next Finlay night. The
game will be played in the Men's gym,
and a record crowd is expected to view
the contest.

Gl‘lllllell’s chances for a lookrlll at
the state championship depend very
largely on this game. By heating
'Iuwa, and then nines. a tie for hoiiois
iivill result, and the fact thzlt Ci-mncll
has played more games in the state
should entitle her to some considera-
tion in case 01' such a tangle. Both
the above mentioned teams have hands
cd out a defeat to the scarlet and black
eailier in the season, but they also
have suffered a i-eicrso each, and have
still one game to play to decide honors
between them.

Interest in Inuit Lineup.

The interest of the Criniicll fans is
centered largely around the personnel
of the Iowa team, It is fairly certain
that Bannick, the Iowa captain and
star forward of the Big Nine, will not
participate in the combat, due to an
obstacle in scholastic matters But
whether haiiniclt is in the line-up or
not, it is certain that Iowa will have
a much harder proposition to tackle
than when she defeated Gl‘illucll on
the Iowa floor by a three point margin
earlier in the season.

The local five are going at top form
at the present time. They seem to
have gotten confidence ili themselves

week-end, and are wor 'ng together in
the best possible inaiiucr. In a scrim-
mage with the Freshmen last night.
the varsity piled up a total of so
points to the Is accumulated by the
first year noon. and frequent substitu-
tions were used at that.

Griiincll has better than a fighting
chance, and the team will do their
share. With thc crowd behind them
all the time, the outloolt is mighty rosy
for a Crime“ victory and another
chance at the state championship.

By trimming Cornell on their own
floor 1‘ t Saturday afteincou by a de-
cisive 12 scoie, drinncii annexed
the Iowa Conference championship in
bashctball. This is the third title
Gl'tllllell has won in Conference athlet—
ics during the past year. Last spring
she won the Conference Meet at Cedar
Rapids, this fall she clinched the Con-,
fei-ence football honors by beating
Cornell here, and last Saturday the
basketball title came to the scarlet
and blaclt by the victoiy at Mount Ven
non. The record is a unique one, and
speahs for the iecent rejuvenation of
athletics here.

Cornell Thiiths Victory Possible.

The Cornell team was out for blood.
Having suffered a defeat at Grinnell’s
hands here, and with their Conference
hopes depending on this game, they
put up a battle for the victory which
seemed to them very possible before
the game was played. However, in
the actual combat Crinnell had the
goods on the Cornell team, and except
for a few fleeting moments, complete-
ly outplayed thcir opponents. The
game was played before a large crowd,
the scarlet fever him being lifted just
before the game.

For the first few moments of the
game neither team could land any
points, but- the Crinncll machine got
started at its old speed, and taking
advantage of a weakening of the Cor-
ncll defense, the scarlet and black
counted eight points before Cornell
scored. The score at the end of the
first half was 14 to (i for Crinnell.

firm in substitutes.

Cornell started the policy of innnins
iii substitutes in the second half, and
for a time loo’hcd dangerous, Sand-
eison ltlld Crigsby diopped in a basket
apiece, and closed Ci-iniiell's lead up”
to four points. Alteritiis short rally
they were held effectually, and Gun-
neil easily piled up a safe margin.

It is hard to pich out the Criniieli
stars in the contest, Me‘ ham and
hagge with their long bastots were
the sensations from the offensive
standpoint, while sivan and Augustine
played a great guarding game. Baghe
also did some pretty passing, and is
credited with the playing the best
game of his career Augustine put an-
other fcathci in his hat by out»scol‘lug
littplcl', the‘ lanlty Cornell center, for
the st time such a feat has been uc-
comii shcd this season.

gave entire satisfaction to the Grinucll
