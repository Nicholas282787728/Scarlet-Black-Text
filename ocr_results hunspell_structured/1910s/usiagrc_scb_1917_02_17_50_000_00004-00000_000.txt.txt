the third presentation, “Orange Blos-
souls” with Miss Hollis, thc talcntcd
ingenue of the company in the lead.
These players in their unique iuctllv
ad of presentation, and with some
thing of the Bohemian atmosphere of
Milwaukee's quaint art colony clinging
to them, will bring to Grinncll a sug—
gestion of the newest thing in theatre
cal production.

Approval From Critics.
So successtul has been the work oi
the Wisconsin Players, that they have
earned the enthusiastic approval oi the
best dramatic critics of the pl'eseut.j
They were especially successlul iu_
their appearance in Chicago.
The plan of guaranteeing the com.
pany a certain sum fur their appeal»
ance, has been adopted by the Di‘amattv
ic Club, as the only method of secur-
ing this production ior Grinncll, which
is perhaps the smallest city on the
tour. Thc company will go from here
to st. Louis.
The system of uniform prices for
seats has been dispensed with, and
they are being placed on sale at vary.
ing prices which, however, have been
placed so low as to be easily within
the reach oi all.

The opera. "The Mikado," which will
be presented by the local lodge of
3Elks in April, will be put on with many
1women characters, but without women.
All parts are to be taken by lodge
members, so that the chorus, which is
a large one, will be iull of masculine
femininity. The cast has been chosen
and was announced for the first. time
yesterday. Work has already begun,
and a good production can be expected
to result.
The cast has been chosen as 1017

The Griuuell Debating Union when
asked about the Judges this morning,
sLEth that the local authorities did no!
lmow many suitable men in Colorado'
who could Serve at the debate, and the
Colol'adu college manager naturally
refused to consider professors at Don-
Vei' University as Colorado debates
Lhat school later in the Seasun, and
also refused men from the other Colo-
l'adu Colleges because of [hair distance
from Colorado Springs. Grinnell at
first protested the use of local judges,

‘but as it came to a question or cancel- '
ing the debate or letting Colorado 021- .

legc choose all the Judges, the latter
plan was followed.

A number or dinner parties were

'given at the Quadrangle the past week.

Mr. and lurs. J. Hubbard oI Gl'lnuell

party which also included Dorothy
