the trophy. but. has never been quite
strong enough. in each 0! the last
three. years they have lost by onlva
fib'W. points, in one case the iinal con-

“The contest was established seven
years ago by Mr. Worth when he con-
trihuted a fund for purchasing each
year a clip to be presented to the

shown the greatest excellence in liters,
