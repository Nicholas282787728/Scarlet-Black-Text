The work or science in the matter
of ﬂood prevention was described with
the aid of pictures taken of the Day—

by the speaker.

Professor Woodward Says College
lien Sllulllll Re Slow to Enter
“Binding 0blignllolls”—'1‘lle
rnnrigcr Professors Should
Enlist Later.

2‘1 certainly think that the college
man should be slow to enter any bl'ntle

mg obligation," was the answer LhaLr

Fl‘uf. Woodward, oi the State Unjvel'»
sity of Iowa, gave to the question oi
”how the college man can best serve
his country,” when interviewed after
his address to the Iowa. Academy oi
Science, at Herrick Chapel last night.

Mr. Woodward pointed out that exA
penance of Europe has shown the
need for educated leaders, and advise
ms and especially trained workers at
the present time alter two years or
the war are over. These are not avail-
able, England’s experience alone
shows that many men havci been
killed that should have been saved for
use now.

The proicssor believes that the
younger college teachers and profes-
sors should enlist when the time
comes. The older members of the
laculties ol. the viii-ions educational
institutions throughout the county
can best aid their country by staying
at their posts and training the
younger men in the ranks at the

en. When the time comes‘

~ their servrcc they will then be
well titted for the task.

Mr. Woodward stated that at Day
tori mechanics were being enlisted a
mechanics and not in the capacity of
soldiers. Duytiiu is matting many inue
nitrous for Canada and Russia. Ac
cor-ding to Pioi’cssor Woodward, the
city is so crowded wrth laborer-s that
many of them rent rooms in eight
hour shifts. First one group or men
sleep in a room tor eight haul and

then itnothcr group comes and occupy‘

the same rooms for the next eight
hours, and so on. Three groups or
man live by shiits in the same room
room.

In regard to his particular line or
wot-ll, the professor stated that he did
not see what direct part it would piay
in the war, but that indirectly, in (lcc
velopiiig watorpower tor manufactur—
ing, it would play a hig part indeed.
