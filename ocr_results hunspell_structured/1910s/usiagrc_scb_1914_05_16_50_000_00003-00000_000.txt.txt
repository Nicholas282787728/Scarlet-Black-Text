NOTED AUTHOR GIVES LECTURE

(Continued from Pave One)

no value to us, as tor 9. topic, the ins
yestigation or a garbage pile, Cheap.
trashy reading is another one oi the
things which many people indulge in
and which is not worth while,

The great aim oi the American peo-
ple, hon-ever. is money making; they
pursue it long aitcr all their possible
needs hare been supplied. li a man
should have a hundred oxen coooked
each day tor his dinner we should
think him a ﬁt subject tor a lunatic
asilllhl; it he should have a thousand
new suits made each day he would he
regarded as or unsound mind, but we
hare not yet come to realize that tor
a man to slerc his life out for mane)
he can not possibly use is equally
toolish.

Turning to things nvortharinle, Dr.
Gladden pointed out that when a man
has enough money to provide hi rea»
sonabie wants, it is north \\‘lile ior
thin to begin serving others. Good
banks are north uhile, and the Bible,
cspc illr, is north all the time no
can put on it It is ll'oltll uhilc to
harc it sound body. though athletics
for their own sake are not north
uhilc. ’l‘lle keynote at the spcaltcrs
conclusion was that in going through
lite we should careiuily discriminate
and choose the things worth while.

"I'd rather be a big load in a small
puddle," he said, "than a small toad
in a big puddle."

"What's The trouble." she asked.
“Can't you ﬁnd a puddle that's small
enough?"
