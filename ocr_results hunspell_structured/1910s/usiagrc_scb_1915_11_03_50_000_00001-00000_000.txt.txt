Superior tcalurnm'li, superior mane
to-nian pl superior attach and de-
ieiisc, supeiiority in oiei-y phasc ol
the iootball game, tells the story of
the 17 to 9 dctcat administered to (Joe
by the Scarlet and Black team on
ward Field last Saturday: In spite oi
all predictions to the coIItI‘ and all
odds oiiered in iavor oi Lilly's team,
the visitors were unable to cope with
the attack offered by their heavy on-
ponents any time during the game.

First Dart-at, in tJoiii‘crciiec.

The defeat. is (he tirst that the Coo
aggregation has snticrctl in three
years, with the exception oi the Ames
contest two years ago, Coming to
Gl-illnell with a conﬁdence born iroiii
a. succession of tuo iietories over the
Scarlet and Black, expecting a hard
game, yet disbelieriug that the locals
had the goods tor so successtul a
comeback, it is no wonder that their
defense wavered when McAlmon‘s then
opened up in the iii-st ot the game
with so bewildering- and unexpected
an attack,

All non-partisan dopesters predicted
that the “break" ol the game in open
iicld work would win ior Gl'illllell it
she uon at all tin |tlmhles, passes,
penalties, and u id, the luck seemed
to rat or Coo above the Scarlet players.
Against no yards at Gl'innell's penal-
.ties, Coe had but 20, Five of Coe's at—
‘tempts at the torn artl ilips were suc<
‘ccssinl out at twelve; lriiuiell com-
pleted three passes ot eight attempted,

The Gl'illilell line wns invincible and
