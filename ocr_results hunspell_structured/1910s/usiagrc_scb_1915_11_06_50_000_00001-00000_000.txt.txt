sett.

Telllu Is Inexperieiicctl.

The team is very inexperienced, the
average nnnrher- oi years on the varsity
being only about one and a halt, while
seven or the eleven men will be racing
Grionell tor the lirst titrre. The only
men who have had previous experience
on the Drake varsity are captain
Blackburn and ”Pete” Welsh at the
ends. hotli oi whom have played two
years previously; and war-nook at
tackle and Smith at halt, who were
on the team last year. Tire other
Drake veterans, Jernegan and Bullz,
will prohahly watch the game from
the sidelines, as both are badly used
up and will be lucky to get in against
Ames in the last game or the season.
They will he missed as both are val-
nahle ground gainers and good defenr
hive men,

Altai-age “‘cight is will

The Drake team is not very heavy
as college teams rnrr. The line aver-
ages 167 2—7 pounds, and the hackiield
156% pounds, with an average [or the
whole team of 163 5711 pounds. This
is approximately the same as the Grin.
nell average, so that neither team will
haVe a marked advantage in this re-
spect.

There is a hare possibility that Smith
may be missing trorn the line—up. in
that case the iorward passing which
Drake has used to good advantage in
most of the games so tar will he miss—
ed much. as he is very accurate and
can pass the hall almost any distance,
War-neck, who receives many ot the
passes, arid Smith, are both basketball‘
men and they show the heneirts at
that sport in teaching them to handle
the hall. The Drake team will start

, the game in no better than iair sirapal
and will he handicapped in case ot‘
further injuries by lhe scar-t- . ot ca—l
pahlc substitutes.
