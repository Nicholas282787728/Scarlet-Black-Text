TUNEFUL MARTHA
AT THE BERCHEL

Opening Performance By Clio Boston
English Grand Opern Contpnny
Is Brilliant Success.

Des illoines Register, Sept. 23, 1916:
Martha danced into town last night
and flung open the doors or the Ber-
ehel theater to legitimate musical
comedy in the shape of Flotow’s
chmnlng old ﬁnel‘a, "lllortha," pre-
sented by the Boston English Grand
Opera company. of which Josenh Shee
ban is the particular bright and shin-
ing light The audience was won at
the first by the excellent rendition of
“Te-overture and entre not music
which has so long been absent in Des
Moincs as to seem almost an inllol'a»
tion when revived.

The tuneiul melodies oi the opera
are not limited to the soloists of the
company. .Rollieking choruses or a
rustic ting. the senlinicntal hallnds of
another generation, and the spirited
and beautiful solos and ensemble num—
bers are as vital and appealing in the
revival of "Martha.” as when it use
first produced and contrast strongly
and favorably with the syncopated op,-
crn conlique 0! our contemporary coin—
posers. Ballads such as "The Lost
Rose of Summer" are not often rival-
ed on the modern operatic stage.

As Lionel, Joseph F. Sheehan is all
he could be expected to be and even
better than when he was last seen with
the Kansas City Grand Opera com-
pany. _Then his voice was a little de- ’
pressed, but last night he sung full
and clear, yet sofL and convincing,
when he Wished. As “)0 opera. Dro-
gressed he got better, singing with
abandon and ease that Wall him Well
earned cncorcs.

Perhaps the audience last night was
as much pleased with Mr. sheehait's
charming primn donna, Mirth Carmen,
as anyone. she is pretty and graceful
and her clear, floating soprano voice
was one that thrilled each time she
broke into the endless song.
