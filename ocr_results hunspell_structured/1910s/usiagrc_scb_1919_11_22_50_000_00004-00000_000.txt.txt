OITY OOAL SITUATION
IS NOT SERIOUS YET

Light and Power Co, Will Be
Forced to Cut Service If Strike
Is Not Settled.

“Gl'lnnell is better nxed than many
nearby towns in regard to the coal sit-
nation.” stated Grant Ramsey, head
or the fuel committee for Grinnell, in
an interview this morning.

"At present Grinnell is not lacing
any real need and it is believed that
the needs of the community can be
taken care or for some time. Few
people realize how unfortunate other
cities are or how the shortage aiiects
every man, wooden and child in them.”

Two cars or coal were taken over

~ this week by the loci committee lrom
the railroad and distributed to the
schools, greenhouses and hotels. The
schools now have enough iuel to run
untii Christmas, if some hauling is
done between the ward that have a
good supply and those that are
beginning to run low. In many
cases a very poor grade of coal, the
slack that has been lying around the
yards, has been mixed with cobs and
kindling in order to keep the boilers
sizzling.

The Iowa Light, neat and Power Co.
has enough coal to run.thrce weeks
longer. At the time the strike was
called it had a six weeks supply. it
no reliei is in sight by the ﬁrst of
the month a reduction will he made
on the power and probably the light
service. At present the local company
is supplying Newton, whose streets
have been dark almost from the very
beginning or the strike.

Local dealers have instructions to
sell not more than one ton of coal to
a family that has real need for it. If
they reiuse to sell it, the consumer
may appeal to the fuel committee tor
aid. ‘ All but two dealers were en-
tirely out or coal that ranged from
so to‘ $16 a ton yesterday.

Classes Flat on Back
As King Flunk
Day Rules.

Friday was flunk day.

The wholo school with the excepr
tion oi the totoball team lelt classes
tint on their hacks and Walked out on
a Deprgetling expedition.

After viewing the procession, the
prois also decided that they needed
the day off and went home on an en—
iorced vocation. Proxy showed that
he was a good iellow by making a iew
remarks to the crowd later on, and
giving his sanction to an alter-noon
recreation hour.

Rumors ol the impending‘De!‘ Tag"
had ﬁltered through for some time,
and everyone was ready for the big
“Fllllili.” Immediately after chapel
the student body fell in behind a meek
old Holstein cow who proudly bore
[the label “This is no Bull: We are go—
ing to Beat Cornell”, and departed as
one professor sadly remarked “For
parts unknown."

Cadyland met the mob with scveral
boxes of candy, after which an ad-
journment to the Strand took place,
even the Holstein going in, although
by proxy. A ﬁne orchestra, songs by
Faye Wilkins and L. L. Border, and
yells by the audience, together with
four reels of real old slap—stick cem—
edy, donated by the Strand and the
Lyric, ﬁlled the rest or the morning.
Herschel Sylvester supplied the after—
the»theater refreshments by handing
out gum and apples. After returning
to the campus, Prery greeted the
crowd from a window in Chicago Hall.

The afternoon was ﬁlled with a rec—
reation hour, featured by dancing, at
the men's gy-m.

An instrumental quartet composed
of Wallace, Wcitz, Border and Almy
with Border as vocal soloist provided
a little extl'ztelerpsichorean syncopa-
tion. A mixed quartet with Bodine
Higley, Adelaide Sibley, Palmer Hodges
and Agnes st. John as performers ran»
dercd a musical rev-lie which delight—
ed the crowd.

After the recreation hour the crowd
adjourned to the lootbnll ﬁeld where
they formed a double line from the
gymnasium to ward held, through
which the toothall men passed,

on the held a bonﬁre had been pre-
pared and with ntting ceremonies, a
pair or Captain Macy's lighting shoes
were solemnly burned.

REVIVE DAYS OF YORE

Mr and Mrs. Archibald Cattell
Are Honor Guests at Univer-

3.2..

(Special to the Scarlet and Black)

CHICAGO, ILL,, Nov. 21.70wing to
the {act that Lhe lights were not
blinked at 10:50 the members of the
Grinnell club of the University or
Chicago and their guests reveled on
past the witching hour of eleven last
Tuesday. The dinner which was held
Tuesday evening in Chicago was the
ﬁrst "mixed" tunction oi the club.

Some twenty couples attended the
dinner, the men all being members or
”associates" of the club, and the girls
all Grinneli girls except in cases
where husbands brought wives and
vice versa. The honor guests oi the
evening were Mr. and Mrs. Archibald
Catteil who have gained tame in
maintaining Grinnell-in-Chicago.

A program of toasts was given after
the meal, alter which the tables were
pushed aside and with Bill Armbrust-
er, ex-‘ZO, manning the piano the}
Grinnellians danced and sang and re-
newed acquaintances. Hotel guests
who went to bed early were probably
startled by the thunder o! bow-Wu
and unless the walls were unusually
tight were fully aware that Sons of
Old Grinneil were present.

Floyd Stansberry '18, acted as toast-
rnsster, Lyle Slushel- was nrst on the
program and put the club on record
as hacking the Grinnell team to the
limit in the Cornell game. He spoke
of the need oi more school spirit in
the university and said that Grinnell
club members with Grlnnell training
help in‘this regard. lrvln inglis ’16,
and Grace Wattsrs»Ma,thewa '16, both
barked back to the "good old days"
in their talks. Archibald Catteli '91,
