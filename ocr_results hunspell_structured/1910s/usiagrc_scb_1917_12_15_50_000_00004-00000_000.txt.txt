Nevertheless, 200 Men Use 100
Pounds More Butter a Month
Than 390 Girls

”There are _three factors which
should enter into any consideration
or food conservation in the two quad~
rangles," said It ~ Traer, in an inter-
view this morning. "These are an
understanding or what the college has
already done, the tact that the mam
agement must keep that within its
income, and a realization or the re—
sponsibility or the individual stu-
dent," she explained.

Since the opening or college the
quadrangle and dormitories have aver—
aged one meatless meal a week, and
no lamb, veal or routton has been
used. Since the students expressed
their willingness. three weeks ago, to
use the coarser grains their use has
been increased until now, they are
used more than halt the time.

Substitutes ior nutter Falls

In the kitchen substitutes tor but—
ter iats have been made use of. The
directions given out by the govel‘ne
rnent concerning the proportion oi
sugar used in baking have been care-
fully tollowed.

Mrs. Traer has round that it costs
irom tour to seven times as much to
serve corn bread and other hot breads
as to serve wheat bread. Also. with
the exception of graham and corn
meal, no substitute for wheat has
been found which costs as little.

Use Much Sugur and Butter

Since sugar and butter-are placed
on the table without restriction, the
students are responsible tor the
amount used there.

In Novemher the girls used just
half as much butter as they had used
in October. Altho there was also a
slight decrease in the amount used
by the men, nevertheless the 2011 men
used 100 pounds more butter in that
month than the 390 women. The
same proportion holds in the use or
sugar, -
