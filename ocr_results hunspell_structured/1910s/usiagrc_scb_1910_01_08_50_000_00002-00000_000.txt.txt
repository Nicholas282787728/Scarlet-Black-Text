SATURDAY, JANUARY S, 1910.

’Vli. NUMBER 26.

The business management of today's
paper is in the hands of Paul Miter
Eachron, ’1].

For an institution which has been
called back to being and given a new
lease of lire during the involuntary
delay in the completion of (lie new
heating plnut, the old plant has been
giving a very good account of itself
for the past few days of twenty-degree
weather.

The vote taken yesterday for the
slandings or the Grillhell candidates
for the Rhodes scholarship presented
is nnnst difficult prohloin to the mem~
bars or the Junior and Senior classes
of the college. It was necessary to
make a choice between three students,
each or whom have made records for
themselves in one or more hranchcs or
the college life. The results were grat
trying in that all men were shown to
stand high in the estimation oi their
fellows. Grinnell hopes to send the
next man to Oxford University on the
Rhodes scholarship. Nothing will have
the weight in determining the choice
next Friday to compare with that or a
united and determined support iron
the student body of the institution.
The tact that Ziegler, especially. rc-
celved the strong support irorn the stile
dents which was accorded liim yester
day, should have no slight errect on
the final result Friday
