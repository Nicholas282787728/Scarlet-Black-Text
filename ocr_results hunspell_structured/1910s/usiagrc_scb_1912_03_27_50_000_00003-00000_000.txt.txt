selves." The idea was refilled that the
man “ith the imagination, the dream
e is unsuccessiul in lire, Dr. Hart
maintaining that imagination and vi:-
ionary powers “ere necessary for ma-
terial advancement. The imagination
may be cultivated thru reading. The
most inspirational or all this is poetry.
It, honever, is not read today as it
was several generations ago. a real
demand for it does not exist. Further.
more, the imagination means nothing
tinicss it includes service.

The music was featured by at de-
lightful soprano sol by Mrs. E. B. 1‘.
