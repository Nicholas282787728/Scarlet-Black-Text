Altho worhing under unusual dil-
ﬁcnlties, the 1917 iootball squad
played a game unequalled in Grln~
Dell’s gridiron history and has ﬁn-
ished the season without defeat.

The war has disrupted the foot-
bali work as no iactor has in re-
cent years. .

No college men have felt the war
situation more keenly than the
members of the team. Several oi
them are already enlisted and awaits
lng orders, others have tried to err
list, but have been rejected top one
reason or another. Most oi the rest
have registered and are making the
most oi their present opportunity
to ﬁnish their education belore be»
ing called into camp.

But, nevertheless, the Grinnell
team has gone thru a season with—
out a defeat. They have fought
from the beginning of the first
game to the end oi the last. They
have detected Grinnell-s strongest
rivals, Iowa, Dralre and Cornell.
They have made a name for them—
selves and the college in athletlc
circles.

Griunell is justly proud oi the
team as a whole, and oi the indi-
vidual men on it. All honor to

TO THE COACH.

Coach Russell Tolletsoh came tu
Grinnell to face a big job. Few
coaches have come to ﬁnd :1. more
experienced team, but never has
a coach come with such a. high stanr
card set by the past two seasons.

To make the season a success,
Tolielson had not only to put out
a teal“ which could win the ma-
jority cl its games, hut one which
could beat lowa.

Coach Tollefson gave his undir
vided attention tn the consummation
of a purpose. His Whole will
and a desire for clean, hard foot-
ball became thoroly imbued inthe
heart of every man on the team. His
desire \\'as reflected on its cohsis~
tent record.

It was With reluctance that the
men whom he had drilled for two
months and whose,sincerc respect
and admiration he had won, bade
him farewell after the closing game.

Grinnell extends her warm a17-
prcciation and hearty congratula-
tions- to Coach Tolleison: theman
whose purpose became a realityms.

c.
THE T\V0 HUNDRED.

Two hundred Grinnell men are
in the military service. Either in
France or at the training camps
they are working their hardest to
help America in the great military
conﬂict.

Two hundred Grinnell men have
become so imbued with the Grins
nell ideal of servicciservice to
country and service to principle—
that they have given up their or~
dinary work and sacriﬁced their am—
bitions to ﬁght for the nation.

This is essentially a war o: ideals.
Grlnnell is essentially a college of
ideals. it is most ﬁtting that Grins

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

nell men should enter into the work
or such a war.

Tllc two hundred will form a per
ulnllcnt honor roll in Gi‘innell's his-
Lory.

G—
NATIONAL SERVICE.

Military service is not the only
rorul ol national service,

Tile Grionell nleo wllo are walks
ing in munitiou plants and govern»
ment laboratories, who have
gone into army Y. M. c. A. work,
and who are spending the year
farming, are deserving ot honor and
praise. They are helping to win the
war.

While military service is the most
obvious, and probably for many men
the best form of national service,
we should not forget the other
ﬁelds. Tile government has called on
college men in particular to help
in those branches ot service which
require highly trained men.

G
PROFESSOR NOBLE.

Dr. Charles A. Noble has passed
his seventieth birthday. At the end
of next semester he will have com~
pletcd twenty-dye years’ service to
Grlnnell as prolessor or English lan-
guage and literature. At that time
he will end his worlr as an active
teacher.

Truly, he is Gl'lnnell’s grand old
man.

He is one ol the ﬁrst men the
returning alumni ash about. He is
a most welcome visitor at alumni re-
unions, and wherever former stu-
dents congregate they always in-
quire about 'Plvctessor Noble’s wel—
tare.

Alumni whose whole lives have
been inﬂuenced by him have sent
their children to Grinnell so that
they, too, could learn to know and
love him. Present day students re—
spect and whole heartedly lilre him.

He has been more than a mere
professor. He has been a Grinnell
institution. Better. perhaps, than
any other one man, he embodies the
ideals of the Grlnnell of old, mod-
iﬁed by present conditions. While
his experience extends far back into
the past, he is most keenly and vi-
tally intercsted in the present. His
advice is always sought when any
change in Grinuell’s life is advo-
cated.

Althu his views are sauely con-
servative because of his wide exper-
ience, he is a progressive in the
best sense or that word. He iirmly
believes in a changing and growing
Grinneil. He has been a champion
of a greater college since the day
he ﬁrst began his worlr here.

Professor Noble will end his dc»
tivc teaching next June. But we cans
not imagine him as a man ol lei~
sure after that time. His wholc lilc
has been one or activity. The liab-
its of a liietiloc can not be changed
casili While he will not be teach-
ing in the college, he will be carry»
illg on some other work with the
rigor ‘u characteristic of him.

driunell, present and past is
proud or Doctor Noble. His pres
cuce here has been most pleasant,
mill his work and ideals will in-
illleoce the college he so dearly
loves thruout the years to come.

G
A GR'KN'NELL IDEAL.

A college for men, a collcgc for
women, and a distinctive coreducdr
llonnl college—that is the vital part
or the Grinnell ideal.

A separate lile tor the men has
undoubted advantages. The close
association of a group ol men in
small dormitory units makes possi-
ble strong friendships. It results in
a sympathetic under-standing and re—
spect of one man [or another.

similarly, a separate lile tor the
women is oi great value. For a
girl to spend {our vears living with
a group or serclal hundred girls
from all parts of the middle west
is an experience which has a life—
long inﬂuence.

Corerlucation is American
idcal. its importance and worth are
seldom questioned, especially here
in the great west.

To comhinc the three types or
higher education—that is the dis
tinctive thing. And Grinnell with her
completely equipped residential
ouadranglcs for both men and wo-

an

 

men, is realizing that ideal.
It la a dream come true.

 

 

PRESIDENT J. H. T. MAIN

 

 

Grinnell and The

War

 

13y President

Grinnell loyalty is a tradition. in
the pioneer days of the college.
when the Population of Iowa was
siilall and the students were few
in number, Grinnell gave Its men
to the national service. They left
college in '61 and '62 with gladness.
The names of those who met death
in the service are now inscribed on
the marble tablet on the east wall
of Herrick chapel.

It may not be generally known.
but it is worth kuowing, that one
of the very ﬁrst Americans to vole
untecr [or service in the Bri sll
volunteer army in August, 1914.
was James Norman Hall, Grinnell
'10.

War was declared on August 5.
Chilling from a solitary tramp in
North Wales, he went to London on

the 18th or August and joined the’

hue ol men scekiug to volunteer at
tho Scotland Yard recruiting star
tlan. After some parley with an
omccr, he was acceptcd, in spite ol
his alien citizenship, as a soldier ol
King George, and thus he became
one of Kitchener's Mob.
Evcnt Worthy of a star.

Looking back, this seems a small
matter. it is not a small matter.
it is worthy ol a red star in tho
Grinocll calendar of events. lt l. —

hides the spirit. of tile piollocl- illlln,

tl-atcd so often in the histoiy or
Grilluell and also the spirit or SE1"
vice. When a man enlists we say
lie enters the service. This word is
not merely a conventional term
when applied to James Norman
Hall.
Following

twentyrﬂlth. year as a member or the

lil'e from active service.

illol‘eibefuxe our government (19»
clal-etl war and cal‘ed for volun-
teers. When the call came Grinhell
responded quickly. Befnl'e June and
and Commencement time arrived
about. 131 had offered themselves
for some form of national service.
or this number 80 went to the
farms. The men who enlisted at
that time for acutal military train-
illg and others who volunteered
later on, are now in every form of
her ca and are scattered every-
where, some at. home, some abroad.
They are giving themselves whole-
heartedly and with enthusiasm to
the grunt business in hrlnll. They

‘al'e doing their hit to solve might

the problems of the world crisis.
Tile number in actual service at the
present time is 196.

lullucilinil-ly at will- in Spi ti

It is certain that a large number
ol‘ lllell ill college would have inls
lllciliatcly volunteered in April, had
not enlistinclil been discouraged for
uudcl-riass men, and especially for
those under tll'entS‘rOlle. The fact
that those who did not enter some
special iollll at service were illlllle-
dialely organized into companies
and placed in charge or a mi tary
ofﬁcer is C\’I(lell€e or the spirit of
Illl" college and its men. We were
at war in spirit illllllodlatcly ,and at
tile some time there was a new birtll
nl national devotion and loyalty on
tho crtluplls.

The women of the college were
no whit behind the men in their
interest. Red Cross work was be-
gun at once and First Aid classes
organized,

G inllcll is not given to loud
demonstration. It goes about its
work in the class room and on the
campus quietly and in order. SD it
is doing now. Grinnell deliberated
before acting, but her ideals, her
democracy, her qualiti s of leads —
sllip and her adaptability to special
demands, arc splendidly meeting the
crucial tests at the present day.

The above statistics are evidences
f the tact that Grinneil is doing her-
art to win this great World war.

These ﬁgures are as nearly accu»
rate as the military records of the
cullcge office show. They are not en—
tirely complete, however, as the ol—
ﬁce is constantly receiving inrorma-
‘timl of the whereabouts of more men,
,There are doubtless a number of
‘Griunell men in the service of which
the college has no knowledge, but ci-
iorts are being made to locate such
men and to follow their movements
as closely as possible.

Nearly llllliilreil Alumni

The total number of alumni in ser-
‘vice is 93. or this number 21 are
men who graduated in the class of
17, alld 72 arc graduates of previous
