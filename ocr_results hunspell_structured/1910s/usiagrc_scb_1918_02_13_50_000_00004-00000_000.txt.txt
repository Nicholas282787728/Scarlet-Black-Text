Ten )cars ago there was no w. A. A.
Board. ll'olllell’s athletics consistcd
tor the most Dim. of unorganized walla
ing and paying ﬁfty cents to belong to
the association. Only a few entllilsir
asts cared to do either. Each year
these few girls had a dance during the
winter and part or the girls went as
men,

In 1909, miss Anderson suggested
that they makc the ailair a Colonial
party and invite all the girls in school
to attend. It more than aroused the
interest it was intended to. The girls
had danced together in society as they
do now, but never before had all the
girls in school been given the oppoiu
tunity to get together and (lance. This
was also before the time of vacation
dances.

Guilt-ll Cylunldl PM”

The affair was not called a colonial
ball, but a Colonial party. It was fol-r
inerly given in the Rand gymnasium,
but in recent years so many have ate
tended that it is now held in the Men’s
gymnasium.

A minuot arranged by Miss Ander-
son was given by the committee, which
has since been given each year by the
w. . A, Board. It will be given this
year with different music. The i-irc-ily
dance and the rye waltz, which are so
popular, were features oi the ﬁrst
dance.

Senior Girls Will Dance

Besides these dances. there is ale -

ways a special feature. This year t is
to bc :1 dance by eight senior girl,
called the Hudson House. It is of spe-
cial interest because, when it was ﬁrst
danced in England in 1820, it was the
ﬁrst time men and women had ever

danced together in this way. The Col- .

onial ball is one of the distinctive oc-
casiolls tor the girls of Giinncll.

Tile men oi the school have been
given an invitation to watch this are
{air from the gallery, and they may
secure tickets free from the librarians,
The ball is to be given on the 23d of
February, this yea

PROMP’I‘NE

Have you ever noticed that some
girls (and boys, too) are proverbially,
eternally, and exasperatingly late?
Thcy or'o late to meals, almost late to
classes, and sometimes miss chapel al-
together.

Occasional tardiness is oitcn-timcs
necessary and can be excused. But
the customary "on, I know I am late,
but I just couldn't help it," is a bit
trying. In college ivc are lenient with
the alwaysdatc, but in the business
and social world, it isn’t done. Wher-
ever we are when we are graduated,
