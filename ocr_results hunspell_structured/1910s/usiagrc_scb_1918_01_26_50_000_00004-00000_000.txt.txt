forces in a recent letter he tells of
his tiip across the Atlantic and his
impression of France.

~By Herbert 'l'iittie

We were mighty anxious to "shove
on" from Quantico aiter our long per
non of training. We felt that we had
spent time enough preparing and were
anxious for new experiences and long—

You can imagine how glad we were
when the word was passed, “Pack your
sea-bags and stand by toi leave in the
morning."

Enjoyed Trip Across

Then there came that new experi—
ence, for me at least, oi being a real
sea—going marine; even if it was just
for a tow days, we learned a little
ol what marine litc is like in time or
peace.

Our ﬁrst submarine attack was put
on by a school of porpoises. The look-
out reported a torpedo coming toward
the ship and fur a few minutes we had
a little real excitement. The next
alarm was a real one, a torpedo Shoot~
ing across our how just ahead at us.
The trip all in all was an uneventiul
one and we were mighty glad when we
“lashed all barnaclcs" tor the last
time and marched on onto good old
terra ﬁrms.

rronce Not Like U. 5.

France is picturesque, yes, beautiful,

way into our camp lingo: we never

we are learning to gesticulate quite

DRAKE l8 UUGKED IN
TIGHT BASKETBALL GAME

Artur listless First Period, Blue and
White Qlliniitt Come Buck Will) it
RIISilil‘vllHIl Score, 20 it) 16

In a game marked by both good and

indifferent playing, the Grinch ha — ,

kotball team was able to nose out vi -
lur last Saturday night, when it iorced
the Drake university quintet to take
the short end of a 20-16 score. The
ﬁrst half or the contest gave no indi-

cations oi developing into such a tight I

game as it proved to he, hut from the
minute the last haii hogan the Drake
ﬁve started an uphill ﬁght which gave
local tollowci-s a big score.

The Grlnnell team started the game
minus the scr ces of Capt. Augustine
who was incligihle on account oi M
soul-i Valley conference rules, consc-
quently it was virtually a sophomore
team that playcd the game for the lee
cal school.

Handicapped by the loss of their star
center, the inexperienced Grinnell ﬁve
went into the game with the odds
against them, but by exhibiting good
team work when their goal was in
danger and forcing the Drake for--
wards to make long shots at the base
ket, the locals gained an eightepoint
margin in the ﬁrst period. The Drake
hunch played a listless game in this
hair and laclded the punch on both de-
iensive and oncnsive work.

Drillto Strong in Second

The Drake coach evidently got busy
during the intermission, for the visits
ors came back in the second De od
with a rush, and inside of three mine
utes had slipped the hall thru the net-
ting toi- [our ﬁeld goals and tied the
score. This spurt was only momen-
tary, for the Grinnell team recovered
and began to display a little teamwork,
With the score tied at iourteen all,
Hammond made four consecutivmiree
throws and added one ﬁeld basket. He
was the only Grinnell man to show
any consistent playing during the
game and made oneehall of the points
which the local team registered.
