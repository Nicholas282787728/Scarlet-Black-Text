Men who once wear our
Clothes are never completely
satisﬁed With anything else.
Because, there is the snappy,
up-to-dute style, the splendid
quality and the beautiful
tailoring that are always
characteristic of SOCIETY
RRAND Suits.

It’s not surprising, either,
for there is something unusnr
ally attractive about the New
Fabrics in their Tones of
Blue, Green and Bro‘lyn, 'and
while it is different, there is
an equally strong appeal in
the New Fancy Suits in Tans,
