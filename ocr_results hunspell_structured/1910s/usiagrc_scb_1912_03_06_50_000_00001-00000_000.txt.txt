People Are Homogeneous,

‘ile fact that Japan, the most dis-
Lilllt ol' crvrl etl countries and one to
\iliith Europeans were not admitted
but a leu years ago, has become such
a power in war is due to the unity of
the homogeneous people. There is
no that at tllvlslon or separation thru-
out the great empire. in many ways
the people are undcmovratic, with a.
very marked tlil‘terenco between the
noble and coolie, and a grill between
the ruling classes and those content
to be govcllled, Yet there is no coun-
try in which the popular will and as-
pirations are reﬂected and carried out
so extensively as in Japan.

Good Educational System.

The strides toward educational adl
varrccment are noteworthy, Their
schools are taught by competent teach-
ers and according to modern methods.
