“We know there will be a future

kept our ideals through all the certs
turies ct houdage. We are proud oi
our national history, which dates back
to the ﬁlth century before Christ.
We are Aryans, the race that includes
all the civilized World. We adopted
Christianity as our national religion
in the third century atter Christ, and
we believe we were the ﬁrst nation
to do so.

"We are progressive but we have
been kept back by ﬁve centuries of
bondage, We have maintained our
own schools, although we have paid
taxes to the Turkish government We
have kept up hospitals and even the
Turks have come to them"

Miss Mesrohian described the suffer»
ing of her people during the past tew
years, and plead tor American aid in
Armenia.

College Income Decreased Forty
Per Cent — New Buildings
Needed Badly.

“There is no such thing as a rich
college,” declared Pros. J. H. '1‘. Main
in presenting the need tor a larger en»
dowment, in Chapel Thursday morn-
ins.

“A college must use all its income,
and in fact, very few colleges come
out even. The purchasing power ct
our income is about :orty per cent
less than it was two or three years
ago, and we must have an increased
income to keep even.

“The college has done‘ a great deal,
and a great deal is expected of it in
the future. Yet the teaching corps.
which is responsible for its greatness,
is ridiculously underpaid. That is
another reason why we must have
more money.

"Then we need a huilding tund,

The sciences are not adequately hous-
ed. We have splendid music here,
but it is not housed at all. We need

ium. The buildings put up are more
than buildings—they are architectural
expressions of culture which shouldi
give nohler views and understanding
or beauty. ’
"Everything tor which this endow-
ment campaign is being undertaken
represents a need in order that this
college may be what it ought to hr
