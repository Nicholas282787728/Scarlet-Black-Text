INTERVIEW/ER.

“Tile Wallis at the southwest corner
of the campus are in a frightful Corr
dltlon," said a man on the iacu‘ti‘
yesterday afternoon. “I saw seven or
eight people came hear-lo killing (lou‘n

- as they passed there and everyone ueiit
olong with a great deal of caution. A
small quantity 0! ashes sprinkled over
the walk at these places would saw: a
great deal or inconvenience to o iiuirr
her or people."

"The condition or the steps at the
library is at positive menace to the life
and limb of those vho have to use
them,” said a member or the faculty
yesterday. "Why is it not possible to
get some sort or an instrument that
will clean oir that ice and snow is
more than i can understand. The
proscncc or ice and snow on the steps
make thtin a place or vcry real danger
to all nlio have to use them."
