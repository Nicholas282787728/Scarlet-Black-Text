REV. MR. HANDY GIVES

EXCELLENT CHAPEL TALK '

Methodist Pastor, Just Returned 1

from England, Gives Imressions
Gained Abroad.

Rev. Elias Handy, who has lately

returned trout a visit In England, gal-e ’

an interesting chapel talk Friday morn-
iiig. He suggested two impressions
which he received while in his native
land. The first one. i. e, the general
social unrest began to be apparent
cvcn before he had leit America, but
was much more noticeable in England
The great question which is being
aslitd on every hand over there is:
“What is God's will concerning plain,
ordinary folks?"

it is the duty ot colleges to answer
such a question as this. They should
prepare doting men and young women
to put themselves in the places of our
ers, not merel to obtain iii'ii idual
beneﬁt but rather the lnrgcr social
gain.

The political unrest also looms
large iii England. Rev. Mr. Handy
characterized Lloyd George as the
greatest man in English polities today
and explained a number of the moose
urcs for which he stands, including the
land tax and the indtistrial insurance
measure,
