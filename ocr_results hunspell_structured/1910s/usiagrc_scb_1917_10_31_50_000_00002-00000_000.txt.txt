Are Grinnell Men Loyal

A great deal of unfavorable come
ment has been made throughout the
state about Gi-innell loyalty, especially-
since the opening of school. This, w

Now, this hysterical lirlino 'ty would
teach us that certain aspects oticul-
lege government should not he ‘popii-

should take p rt in it, They would

ﬁtted to do so that they are students.
Our minority iiit’orhiants who tell of
tlic unpopiilai-ity of popular goverih
nient give a direct slap in the lace to
Gl'innell democracy and likens the
Grinnell student to :i child who is
asked to vote on the advisability ot
taking castor oil; the \‘otc would be
in the negative. The child is not come
potent to judge, and if he has been
properly taught he has learned to rely
ilpon the judgment at his pal'ent‘

There cannot be responsibilit with»
out authority. The presumption is that
a college student has learned respon-
sllnllty, and with this I'CSDnnSlll ~
has learned to rely upon the dictat
of his own needs in the ﬁnal settler
merit or his particular social needs

The recent vote taken on the advi .
ability of abandonment of the present
pernicious Sunday date iiilo was Vir—
tually a landslide in favor of s
abandonment, Such a vote is indtc .

As one editorial puts it “Ross Crane knows Art
and llc knows folks, and just leave it to him to

bring both together.”

That's it —lic knows FOLKS as well as art; and

he loves both folks and art.

He is one of the few

men on this planet who can talk about art in 3

HUMAN WAY.

Pcdple “laugh right out loud" during his lectures!
Think of HUMOR in a lecture on Artl

But that‘s natural when the lecturer himself is a
humorist; and Ross Crane has a national reputa-
tion as a great entertainer because of the posses-
sion of this rare combination of artistic perception
and a keen sense of humor.

Artist and humorist—yes, and philosopher and
musician as well-sail in one in this lecture on Art.

He will malt: you laugh and make you cry—a

little.

He'll punch to you—and teach you.

He

will talk art to you so you will understand it and
love it; he will draw pictures for you and make

music for you.

Come to the ﬁrst lecture-"(lien you will not lac
able to stay away from the rest of them.
