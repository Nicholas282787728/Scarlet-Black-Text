Gl‘lnnell (locs nectl at least one thing,
that fraternities have. That is lhc‘
’close bond or a small group fellow-

The relationship “‘lllcll binds thc
gigllt hundred Students of Gl'lnnell to-

valuable but even more ﬁnd is thez
.relationship existing in the close felr
lowship of the group of thirty.

In the cottage and hllildingounits of
the Women’s quadrangle and the men’s
dormito es the ground has been pro
pared. Ttht remains is to develop a.
house and cottage spl t which Will
mean something in terms cf common
fellowship within the group.

At present this does not exist to any ‘
great extent. It is our‘ opinion that
there are many inch and Women living
in dormitory and, quadrangle buildings
who do not know by name all of the
members nf their own house unit. Cer~
tainly their fellow house members, as
a whole, are not on a plane of fellow-
ship any above that of members of

- other buildingh,’

’ The situation calls for a wisely di-
rected effort to develop building spirit I
by all concerned.

The deans will help but the ﬁnal
action must come from the students.
The luture lite oi the dormitories and
the quadrangle along (his most vital
lin‘e lies in the hands of the present
college generations. They should see
that proper precedents are set to de—
Vel and maintain a proper building
spirit. But they should be very sure
that the precedents Which they set will
stand the test cl time.

Friday the student body and faculty
will vote on new student Council
members. That is, a. small proportion
of the students will vote and an even
smaller representation or the faculty.
or course Friday may prove an excep—
tion'hut on the record of past student
elections of various kinds and on the
voting recorder the state at large
comparatively lew will be enough in
terested to mark a ballot '

There have been in the past expres-

‘ :lons of dissatisfaction with the lack
of importance Which has fallen to the
student Council. The student Council

”will be just as important as the stu—
dents Can-to make it.

If it is to be considered important
by the other parties or the college
group it must be truly representative
of the student body. To make it rep-
resentative requires that every Stu»
dent (in his psl‘t, ﬁrst in voting, second
in giving' careful consideration to
qualiﬁcations of the men and Women
for whom he votes to represent him. A
small vote hearing all the ear marks
of being highly inllucnced by personal
lilies and dislikes will hardly start the
Student Council on the way to the im-
portant position which it should oc—

eupy.

.We Wish to remark that if it were
as easy to stick to cnc’s studies as it
is,~this weather, to stick to onc's

prevalent. A professor doesn’t need
to hold his class, the chairs do it for

' 'him.
