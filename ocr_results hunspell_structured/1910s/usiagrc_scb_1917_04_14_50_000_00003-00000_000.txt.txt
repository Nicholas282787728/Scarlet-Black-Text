The article in speaking or the choice
of the present director of athletics,
says: "Hitti is chosen as greatest
among the nztmos oi Augustine, Zeigr

Fiskc, K. Carney, and Hoyt. This se-
lection will meet with opposition troin
those who will picir Charles Hoyt, the
present sensational spi-intcr at Grin»

mains that Hoyt, as yet, has only one
great victory to his credit siucc cuter-
