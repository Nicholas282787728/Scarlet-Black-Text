movement, and to all'itlicll (lit-m to
the pnssibiliti contained therein
for constructive ivorli in a ﬁeld
which has out ' just been opened
to educational work.

The Chinese Revolution .
hailed as an cpotlirniaking event
in the history of Demoe e, That
it has thus far failed to accomplish
the results expected is due to the
fat-t that the people had had no op»
portunity under the imperial F6.
gime to guin any conception of the
principles of democratic govern-
ment.

The immediate aim of the Grin-
nellrianliina movement is not to
Christianize the people, but to give
them the beneﬁts of western nitrtlr
ads of education. Religious teach-
ing has its fundamental place in
the educational methods pur-
sued, and it is not surprising-that
the students regard an uiidersttintlr
ing of Cliristianit as 'an‘ essential
part: of their training. The adop-
tion of the religious principles
taught f0llO‘ in most cases, as a
matter of course.
