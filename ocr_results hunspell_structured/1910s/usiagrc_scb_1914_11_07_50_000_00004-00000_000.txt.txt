are si-liLl to to unusually hright and
clever, and there is good authority tor
this since Burns Mantle, tho ueli»
liuowii New York critic, writes oi it as
iciiow “My Best Gii'l' is a good lit
tle git-l uith a tiiture, not a had little
girl with a past. She is as demure
as her sister, The Quaker Girl‘ and
as gracotul as her cousin, 'Thc caiety

hright as new coined money and the
music is all ligiil midi iuileiul,” ,
Louis DeFoe stated in the New York
Morning World: ~ ‘My Best Girl' is all

unusually dainty and atirzicti e." cone
tinning, Mr. DeF‘oe said: “if there
were a tow more musical comedy aus
thors in this country who could turn
out lihrettos as lively and entertaining
and in such scrupulously good taste as
the one Channiog Pollock and ileuncld
Wolf have written tor ‘.\Iy Best Girl
the‘ lollowers of that kind ot diversion
could say good bye to the London cons
trihutors to the gaieiy ot the theatre
without so much as heaving a sigh."
victor Morley, who heads the coin-
partyitile only one presenting “My
Best Lilli" today—tormerly supported
P'chard earle in his musical comedy
successes. During the past three years
he has starred in “Tile Quaher Gir
