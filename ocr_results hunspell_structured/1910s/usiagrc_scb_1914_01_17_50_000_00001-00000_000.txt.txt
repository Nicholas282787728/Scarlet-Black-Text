RELATES DUTIES BE THE CITIZEN

.Dr. Steiner Discusses World Cilia

zenship at Friday
Chapel.

"The college student of ioday flutls
himself in World movements, mayor
ineuts ignoring all races, all classes,
and it becomes the privilege, the duty
of the- college student to become a
world citizen." This was the theme
of Doctor Steiner's Chapel talk yester»
dal’ morning.

To become a world citizen, the
speaker emphasized, we must cultivate
our minds; we must know language,
literature,,blstory. and the Bible, that
we may become acquainted with the
great minds of the world in which we
are to he citizens. “The mind must he

the truth from many angles, and must
be exercised, as the body is exercised.
but with the realization or its greater
importance. This is the dilticulty of
the college student."

Professor Steiner further pointed
out the opportunity the college offers
(or the development 01 sympathies.
College students differ widely, in a
social, in an intellectual and even in
a racial w but to learn to love the
\Ililol'ely, to like the unlikable, and to
step down from class pride, is the les-
son of the college student, and air es

sential tor the attainment of world
citizenship.

“Again, a world citizen must have a

all classes goes down in the gutter,‘

down in the ﬁlth and dirt and helps
them. This is the requirement oi world
citizenship, the cultivation or the mind,
the development ot the sympathies,
and the possession of a spiritual vis-
ion. These will make the college slu—

Two-Hour Exams To Be Held.

The regular- semester examinations
will be held on the last four days or
the week, beginning January 26, These
examinations will be two hours in
length, as last year, instead at being
broken up into periods of one hour
each, as was formerly done. It has
been found that this system produces
much better results than the other.
as the average student does better
work in the longer periods, The pro-

“PATENT LAW” HULIJS INTEREST

John L, Jackson Delivers Excel-
lent Paper at Humboldt Soci-

ety Wednesday.

Humboldt society was addressed
Wednesday evening by John L,
Jackson of Chicago, on the subject. of
“Patent Law."

Mr. Jackson is one of Chicago's tore-
inost specialists in patent law. He ex
plained the means of securing patents
and gave an account at the operations
or the patent oftice.

Mr. Jackson dismissed the inﬂuence
of the patent law in encouraging the
spirit of invention. He also Il'ezlLerl
the law from ihc point of View of Ill-Or
tection lor the rights of the luanulac-
turer.

. r, Jackson seemed to consider
patent law from the point of view of
the investor and the manufacturer
rather than from that or the needs of
society at large but he gave an excel-
lently written paper and treated his
subject with authority.

READS LETTERS_ FIlUM ALUMNI

Harvard Men Discuss Grinnell
Problems in Letters Read
by President Main.

'Studyiug spare moments because
your time is so taken up by outside ac-
tivities, doesn’t pay in the long run,
according to some old “grads", whose
letters President Main read at Chapel
Thursday morning.

President Main wished to emphasize
the iact that our opportunity for suc»
cess in letter lite lies right here betore
us now; that, consequently. we should
cultivate the power or concentration,
work at our studies while we may,
and not be afraid to take stiii, disci-
pling courses. That student who is
so completely occupied with outside
activities that he doesn't have time to
study loses the advantage obtained by
one who does iull justice to his regw
lar work and then lets outside actii
ties take up the spare moments, was
the general theme oi the talk.

The letters read were written by
two men who are now students in the
llarvard Law School. One oi the lei:
lers round iault with Griuncll, stating
the the college did not ”save him
irom himself.” The other letter placed
the responsi ty for failure lo grasp
the opportunities oiiered by the col-
lege directly upon the student burr
selt.

GUES TU TITWN FIJIl ASSISTANCE

Skating on treacherous ice claimed
allither victim last night in Myron
Thompson. ’17, of Nevada, Iowa,
who skated into an opening in the ice
at Arbor Lake and was drowned before
aid could reach him. The body was
not recovered until 3:30 this morning.
The search was conducted by the ﬁre
department.

There are two holes in the ice at the
scene of the accident. The search tor
the body was conducted at the larger
cl these two openings until about 3.30
this morning. when a cap was discov—
ered ﬂoating on the surlace of the
water in the other hole. Alter ﬁve
minutes‘ work the body was recovered
from the water at this place. The
indications are that it the mistake had
not been made in (he location of Lhe
scene, the boy might have been me
covered in time to save his life.

Boynloll Witness of Accident.

Quincy Boynton, ’17, of Sioux Rapids,
roommate oi: Mr. Thompson, was the
only witness of the accident. He was
unable to convince the other skaters
that any untoward event had occult
red. and was able to arouse aid only
after running several blocks and calla
iug out the ﬁre department.

Boynton was skating about a bun-
dred yards in the rear of his cumming
ion, when he heard the latter's cry tor
help. Following the general direction
or the call, be came upon the large
opening in the ice, at which the long
and uuavailing search was later con-
ductedb

poyutou had accompanied llls roomr
male to the hike. He tells the stars
in these words: “We started out at
about ten minutes alter eight, and put
on our skates at the north end ot‘ the
lake. We started out together, but
one oi my skates wouldn't slay on, and
i stopped to ﬁx it. '

"I was doi 1: this. when I heard
him call, and got up just as he ycllcd
’Boyntoli" again. i was about a burn
drcd yards behind him then, and in
skating up i nearly went into the hole
inyseli. i couldn't see anything down
at the south end.

Skate Tracks Lead to little.

“\Ve saw the skate tracks leading
right up to the hole, and it looked
like someone had tried to stop there,
so we worked there until alter three
o'clock. Then someone happened to
notice a cap in the other hole about
ﬁve was away, and we began lo drag
that and pulled up the hotly just at
3:30."

The absence of any struggle to lead
Boyntou to the true locality oi the
accident is probably explained hi- the

w tor About Six Feet Deep.

Charley Green, the ﬁreman who
found the body, states that the water
was not over six feet in depth at this
spot, Some oi the ﬁremen claim that
the ice had been cut, but an examina-
tion failed to substantiate this report.

In detense ol the authorities, it is
stated that a man car ying a lantern
warned the skaters early in the even-
ing not to skate at the southm end or
the lake. There was no warning sig-
nal or any sort at either at the two
openings in the ice.

with the same result.

As soon as the ﬁre department was
aroused, the truck was brouglb to the

instituted with the aid or ﬁre ladders
