The opinion on I\\'enl)IEI, probab ~
the most lea-ed ot the Yo
critics upon the Wont ot the pr sent
quartet is noteworthy: “A conceit goer
might live a liictime and not hear such
beaulriul liornogeniety of tone not such
enphony and precision, Their liatn
moiiy sounds like that of air attuned
organ. A quartet of excellent artists
are these.”

.,inong other things the quartet i ’ll
render a good deal or the negro [011:
music which has been or vored and
introduced to the world by Fisk Unr-
versity. These songs are without par»
allel among musical productions. Iii-
lohsely religious they touch the heart
with their pathos or excite to laughter
by their quaint conceptions. Sting by
U iiied vocalists who are thoroly in
sympathy with the emotional nature
or their or ginatoi-s, they have a unique
and power-nil appeal to all classes.

Ediiiorid liosland, probably the great-
est livrng French dramatist, has given
to the world several trials, which are

since the day of Shakespeare. Whether
this assertion is trite or not one must

t-lles nomniresques", a [tiny oi the
light, lolllclr'lllg, pleasurable type, is
the story oi two young people, who are
extremely desirous or enjoying the our

who own adjoining estates, ieign hat:

the young people to tail in love in the

planning with practical French bour-
geois shrewdness, that the aliair shall
not end in tr gedy hut in oldioshioned
marriage, which shall rinite not only
the lovers, but also their estates.

reading Romeo and Juliet, have come

The pldy trhounding in sparlrlirig wit

French comedies, is a masterpiece hunt

great c tic, M, Jacques dcs Tillet, said
alter its ﬁrst presentation, “Those, in.

ltepresenrutiye Senior women when
aslretl what éi-innell had meant to
them and what opportunities they had
missed, gave the iollowing answers:
“The two best things i have gained
in Grillnell, especially in the last year.
are a. sense or the unity WiiACII exists
among all people oi whatever type or
position, and it inller realization oi
the truth and power or my religious

ideals, As for the things I have mlSS«
etl, l most regret that l have not tried
to know more people as they really are,
and that 1 have not fully appreciated
always some oi the great personalities
to be Yollml in Grinncll.’

"I believe the greatest thing that
my college course has brought me is
high ideals. Gi-inriell gives her sons
‘and daughters an entirely netv picture
or what our lives ought to be. in ad-
di ion to this, I prize most oi all the
ii-iendships that l have iorriieo here.
One oi the opportunities that l have
neglected is that which the

i have used the library iairly successA
tully in connection with my studles.
but I reel that look at o lrontvicclge of
present day events, such as the netvspa’r
pets and magazines attord ' ‘

Somewhat along this line is the an-
swer oi another who said:

. ost or an, i have missed the op-
portunity which this library aiioros.
Here are row alter row oi the best
book. in literature and yet i have
touched hardly one oi them illu'illgvmy
iorri- years. in tact, i can hardy locate
a book when 1 want it. We ought to
cultivate the reading habit while here,
so that alter we leave Grinnell it may
be one oi the sources oi orri greatest
ltloaslll't‘."

"I have missed the opportunity to
know people. 1 have limited my
liicndslrips too much to my own class,
and have not, during my upper-class
years, been of as much service to oth-
ers as i should no , been."

"I have had :r good time (or tour

tlid time here, and still do very credib

Gl'illnell ,slie replied, “I haven’t missed
a thing worth going to ior- lour years
