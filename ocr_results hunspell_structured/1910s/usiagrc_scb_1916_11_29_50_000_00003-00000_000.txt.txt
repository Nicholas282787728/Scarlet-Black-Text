det $100,000 has been secured since
the opening of College in September
to apply on a ildlfrlllillioli—ilollal' ens
downient and building fund was the
gist of a statement given out yesteiu
day at the College Office. This more
ey is being raised entirely within the
state of Iowa, and the time limit for
the campaign is set for next Coin-
nicnccnient.

This is a part of the millionnollar
campaign which was launched by
President Main last January to con-
tinne through an indefinite period of
time, and is the third financial Call:-
paign since his inauguration in the
early months of 1906. It is the most
extensive in the history of the insti~
tution, representing an amount double
to that ever before raised at one time.
When completed, over $2,225,000 will
have been added to the College treas-
ury since Mr. Main became president.

Rockefeller and Crrncgie Donnie.

Both previous campaigns were for
$500,000 each, the former having been
completed in December, 1908, and. the
latter two years ago last April. The
General Education Board of the Rock-
efeller Foundation pledged $100,000 in
each instance, it being stipulated that
Grinnell should raise the balance in a,
certain period of time. Andrew Carr
negie donated $50,000 ill 191-1, lower-
ing the amount to be raised by the
College to only $350,000.

Million For Buildings llnd Snlarif-s.

N0 definite use has been assigned to
the million dollars which is being
raised at the present time, but it is
understood that it will be divided
largely between buildings and endow-
ment for salaries. a large number of
buildings will be erected within the
next tew year-s, chief among these.

needed the former having been in use
since the cyclone in 1882. The gym-
nasium is much too small, and will
be supplanted with a building fitted
out with complete modern equipment,

it has been the aim of President
Main to constantly increase Grilluell's
endowment to keep pace “itil its in-
crease in enrollment and hrrildings.
During the last few years, particular-
ly since the construction of the Girls’
Quadrangle, large numbers of sins
dents from the leading high schools
of Town and other states have been at-
tracted here because of the notable
advance in Grinnell's building equips
merit and teaching force, This addi—
tion in enrollment calls for a corre
sponding increase in buildings and in-
. uctors, which in turn demands a
greater endowment. A large percent-
age of this endowment is used to in-
crease the salaries of professors and
to secrrrc a higher grade of instruc-
tors. Such a system as President Main
has inaugurated is in use in all the
better institutions of learning in the
United States. .

Property is ulveir.

The donations which the College has
received in its financial campaigns
have not all been in the [arm of cash.
Two recent gifts of property aggrev
gate nearly a quarter- of a inrllion,
one of those being a lot in tlic heart of
Kansas City and the other land in

is being erected on the Kansas City
place, which will be operated under
the direction of the College officials.

of material is available this year, and
the outlook is bright for a. fast team
that will live up to the Standard set
by Grinnell quintet: in the past.

The situation this year is materially
different fionl that of the last season.
Gl‘imlell last year faced the problem
of developing a team from green play—
ers, and put that burden on the shoulr
dei-s aha new coach, “Fat” Carney.
Under these conditions a fighting team
was developed w ch lost the Confer—
ence Championship by only two points.

An experienced couch and team are
on hand this year, however. All mem—
bers of the 1915415 squad are in school
with the exception of Farker and
Meek. Vll'ith Captain Swan, r'orl'is,
Somers and. 'll'att, there will be an
over-abundance of crack guards. Some
ers, the shifty forward last year, Will
|he changed to guard this year, and his
four years’ high school experience in
that position will make him a valuable
man. Alec Miller and V. Daubcnberger
of tile Sophs will also make the scrap
for guard positions interesting.

Expect Good ruruards.

The scarlet and black fire last year
lacked any outstanding forwards, but
from all prospects it seems that that
evil will be corrected this year. Mea-
cham, Targgai't and "Dutch" Miller,
all Varsity incn last season. Mill be
out, and together with Earl Macy,
who showed up well in the class se-
ries, and lVoi'th, Bagge and Herman
of the Sophs, a classy pair of forwards
should be unearthed. lVoi’th should
prove a good lnzln because of his size
and eye for baskets. Daggc also is a
good fighter and has a tendency to lo-
cate the ring from. any distance or an-
gle. If Worth is tried at forward, the
center jOb will probably be "Mike”

Forgot the successful season this
year and look Ioruard to the football
team that will represent Gi-iuucll next
fall. Prospects for a winning season
have never liccn better in the history
of Grinilcll football.

Captain Barrett and Macy are the
only men who will leave the sound on
account of graduation. Every other
man will return next year. With all
but two of this year squad back, a
team of veterans will represent the
scarlet and black on the gridiron,

Earlier Will no line .

Besides the members of this year’s
squad who will return, there will be
added three ail-conference men of a
year ago. They are McLaren, Parker
and sinalley, all of whom are at the
Mexican border with the army.

With par-ker. Grant, Schulz and Day,
Grinnell will have a double shift of
veteran backs. Besides these there
will he a freshmen who has proved
the mainstay of thc yearling offense.
He is Frank linrkiey.

“Mike" Will Play Fullback.

"Mike” Augustine, nonpareil on Iowa
gridirons, will be back again to take.
up the burdens of fullback. His un-
derstudy will be Fleck, who has dis-
played good lootball on each occasion
he has had to play, ’

“Fuzz” Watt will return to pilot the
team. He will be opposed by Fraser
of the Freshman, and Carl Meek, who
subst; utetl at quarter last year.

Wings Will Be Experienced.

The new coach who i 'll be chosen
in McAlmon's place, will find at his
disposal more material for the wings
than has presented itself to Grinnell
[or several years. Buhlman, RaffetY.
Gettys and R. i-ioyt, all of this year's
squad, will return. sinalley will be
back [rain the border, and Mcilurray
and Ray Dimit oi the Freshmen, will
offer serious opposition to the Veter-
ans,

There will probably be a three cor -
cred light for center. “Frogsy” Gi -
gles will he opposed by "Smok '
Brown of this season's squad and Cap—
min ll" mer of the Freshmen. Witmcr

man the strong Freshman team have
had this year.

lchai-cu will be back to help hul-
ster the present strong line. He was
playcd at both tackle and guard last
year with remarkable success. His
playing ryas ol‘ such merit that he was
placed on the allrstzlte team. Martin,
)rires, Millerd and M nion will all
probably return to pi , guard.

Several hediy freshmen will be out
to oppose Osgood, south and “Dad"
Hoyt for tackle positions, With these
heavy tackles and the excellent
guards, the center of Grrnnclrs for-
ward wall will be almost impenetrable.

Look For Successful recr.

Next season is l'ookcrl forward to as
one which will be even more success—
ful than this season. The new coach
will find waiting for him a wealth of
veteran material supplemented with
excellent men from this year's year-
lings. len this material there should
he built a team very strong on both
defense and olfenscid team that will

prove a stumbling block to many Iowa
elerens. '
