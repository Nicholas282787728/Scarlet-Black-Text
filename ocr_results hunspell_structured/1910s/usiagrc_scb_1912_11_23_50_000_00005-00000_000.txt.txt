ronsidcled one of the foremost organs
ists of the United States and displayed
last evening his right to be so consid
ered.

The ﬁrst number on the proglam
was the Fantasia and Fugue in G
Minor, by Bach, which is extremely
difficult, but was mastered technically
by Mr, Andrews.

Tile second number, Canon ill B
minor, by Schumann was a beautiful
little compo, on and so delighted the
audience that Mr. Andrews was conic
pulled to repehL Tllc Pastor-ale by
Rheinbcrger was a flowing, “liquid"
melody, and the Mendelssohn Scherzo
formed a sharp contrast with its crisp
staccato daintiness.

Chopin arrangements for the organ
are unusual, and therefore the two on
the program were exceptionally inter-
esting, A difference at opinion pre-
vuilrd as to the merits of the two num-
bers, a “Prelude," and ‘Etude," some
preferring the Etudc. others the Prer

for organ, was charming and well-

\ir. Andrews proved himself a coin»
poser as well as organist, by his own
composition, a “Scherzo," which was
both musical and Vel‘i' eiiettil‘ . The
Nevin “slumber Sons" was yet iln-
pressive on the organ.

The two Wagner numbers at
close of the program, were the
Tralllne. and Ride of the Val , es,
and were probably the most eniol'ahle
numbers on' the program

The only thing lacking to the pro
gram was that the audience was not
so large as it should have been How
ever, the appreciation ot the audience
was very great and made up for the
lack of ii larger crowd.
