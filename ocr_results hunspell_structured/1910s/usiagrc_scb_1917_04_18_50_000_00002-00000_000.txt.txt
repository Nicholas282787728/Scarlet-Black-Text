A new way of getting by final exams

r —enlist.

Those dandelions will appear pretty
soon.

0 what is so rare as a college stu-
dent who wants to he only a private?

Now if someone will just figure out
how we can sing a different national
song in chapel every morning for a
week—

Wouldn’t it be great it the English
limguage was' big enough so a man
wouldn't have to use slang?

A nian up at Minnesota University
wants more attention given to military
training in such a national crisis as
this. “At such a time three hour-s a
day seems a paltry service,” he says.
Three a dayl—wlicn Grim-tell spends
only tour a weekl

FLAG ETIQUETTE.

Loyalty to the country is being dis—
played everywhere in Grinnell, if the
number or ﬂags in evidence is an in-
dication of it, > The way thinkers or
all different beliefs have put thorn-
selves behind President Wilson is re-
mar-liable.

its a method of showing expression
in a time or such great national crisis,
the placing of the American iiag is
about the least that can he done. But,
as with anything else, there are. ‘ght
ways and wrong ways or displa ing
the ﬂag. It is well to observe these.
The etiquette of the flag as given by
the war and navy departments is as
follows:

"The position of the liag is aloft,
tron-r the pinnacle of a building, highs
cr than furniture oi a room and above
the head of one carrying it

“The mag must not be ra 'ed before
sunrise nor remain up otter unset. In
raising or lowering the flag it must
never be allowcd to touch the ground.

"mien the flag is raised tor-malty,
all present all stand at attention
with hand i sed to torched ready
(or solute. When the color are 1
ins on parade spectators, it s ting,
arise—and stand at attention.

“The tlag hung out of doo shall al-
ways tly to the breeze, preicra lly irom
a pole, and should never be fastened
to the sitlc or a building, platrorm or
scaffolding,

“The line should never be placed bo-
law a 1101'an sitting. It should not he
used as a covcr tor a table, desk or
box, nor should anything he placed on
it except it he the Bible. The ring
should never be so plnccd that it will
be struck by a gavel.

"The ﬂag should not be worn as

part or the whore cl a costume. When
u orn as a badge it should be small and
jpinncd oler- the left breast or on the
'lert coat lapel.

“The flag should never be washed.
When worn or torn it should be reve
eiitly llurnei

THOSE orlirzi

Iii demanding that ore ‘V able bodied
man at Allies [alto military drill the
Iowa State Student has the following
to say:

“Iowa. State ' sadly behind most col»
logos and unlrc stiles in this l‘eSDect.
It should be a source of great. shame
to us that Grinnell and Drake are do»
in; more in this YDSVOCL than we are.

“An Grinnell and Drake every ables
bodied man in school is required to
take military drill. These two schools
are not state supported, as “'e arct
and are under no obligations in the
government. This action was taken
by the boards of (lilectors of those
two institutions of their own volition
and at. the instigation of the student
bodies.”

We Wish What lhe Student says
about Grinneli were tl'ueiithat every
able bodied man in school were taking
military drill. But we have a confess
sion to make here. Only 160 out of
approximately 400 men have appeared.

What is the matter With the Grins
nell man's yatriotisrn’! “’hat is the
matter With 240 men in the college?
There are icw men who could not
spend four hours a week, Other (:01-
leges are Spending two a. day. Minne-
sota spends three hours every day,
California the some, and one institu—
tioniis devoting the Whole of every afr
ternoon to it. Still another plans to
finish the semester's Work May 1 and
Spend the rest of the school year in
nothing but military training. Eastern
schools have extensively given up all
athletics so that every valuable min-
his can be given over to patriotic elr
deavor.

other schools are giving muc‘n im-
poi-mime to military lrnining. Why
not in Grinnell? The Grlhnell man is
patriotic, but he just hasn't thought
enough about it yet.

Fellow students: There is much
talk or "What can I do for my counti
and the allies?" At present our pdll‘
(1th duly seems to he economyaecon-
iorny or money, energy,
Can the Grinnell student do this in
‘any better way than by giving up the
little extras, as candy, caudylands,
movies, ctc.7 It seems only [air and
just that we should be willing and
glad to deprive ourselves tor the sake
of a big cause.

Our own eount- 's plans for the war
are as yet so unorganized and indeﬁ-
nite that we have no one cause to
which we can give our monev But,
having espoused the cause or the al-
lies, we have made their interests our
inter sts, and our duty is to follow
their lead and aid the Belgians in their
misery. We can ask {or no gr-cator
pri ilege than to do our bit.

Every Grinnell student Will hitvc itn
opportunity to do his share in eedihg
these starving children by gi 'ng up
for onc month his little extravaganccs.
Think of the good we can do by this
very slight sell—denial or things on-
tirely unnecessary to our vlclim-ei
Can we offer to fall behind the East
find the war ing nations themselves in
this service to humanity?

Three supposed thieves, an irate au~
tomobilc owner and the Grinch par
lice department clashed last Sundav
morning alter a wild chase all over
town and the neighbor irrg country.

A Ford automobile belonging to Lee
laud Johnson, '15, had been taken from
in front of the ineshiek restaurant.
The owner immediately gave the co
number to the police, who started out
at once in search or the Ford. Within
an hour- it had been located and a Do»
licernaii in another car gave chase,
tiually landing the three men who
were in it. They were placcd under-
arrest.

When Johnson appeared at the po-
lice statiori and asked to see the ﬁlllir
posed thieves, he found sitting on smile
old, dusty ch 'l's lichirid the bars three
of his best Illcritls They were Lewis
Barrett, Griuncll iootliall captain of
note, Paul Holiowuy and Lincoln Ackr
crnian, all students in the college,
Johnson had them released at once.

All parties claim it was a practical
joke. Johnson says he knew who bad
the car- and had the men arrested as a
joke on them, The three men, houu
ever, say the joke is on the Grinnell
police tor-cc, since they knew the per
lice were after them and wanted to
give them a “run for their money
But the police i st that the look
which came over Johnson when he
round his three best friends behind the
bars would indicate that the joke was
on him. Anyway ,it was a job
