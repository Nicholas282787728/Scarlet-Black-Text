brothers and sisters were done to
death by the mob in Kishinelf. in this
act Edgar A. Cnpp, who took the part
of David, carried h audience with
him in his touching description or that
awful Ilioment, and thloughout he
brought to the characterization oi the
lovable young musician; who saii' iii
America the crucible, “The Melting

not: space for lei extended analr is it
is only possible to give brief illlelil'
us) mention of some of the more prom
inent ﬁgures in the drama. One char
actel‘lzation is especially noteworthy.
It is that of the aged Fran Qulxano,
grandmother of David, taken by Vir-
ginia Cole. it is a simple part, that of
a little old woman, absorbed in her
memories, living only in her religion,
but it was played n'itll a creative force
which gave the little bent form a rare
pathos and dignity. It was one of the
most effective characterizations ever
seen on the stage in Grinnell.

Albert E, Stuellle was cheedingly
eitective as Mendel Qu' ano, the uncle
at David. The character is a. delight-
lul one. not devoid of humor and
aboilnding in bits of real humanit} Lind
it Was played with an appreciation and
skill which made it one ot the salient
teatures oi the evening.

Miss Deborah Miley as Vcra Reven-
day, brought to the palt a. sweetness
and natural aptitude which made it a
pleasure to see and hear her. Her pol"
trawl! was adequate and satisfactory
at all times,

Everett S. Turner took the difficult
role of Baron Revendal, father oi Dar
vill's Sweetheart. with much credit
His acting showed careful Stillll' and
lull appreciation (if the situation.

Harry M. Rouell was a favorite with
the audience from the time ll [all but

was quite at home as the brusque little
orchestra Conductor and appeared to
like the part quite as well as the part
liked him.

Elsie Sharer was exccilcnliv cast as
Baroness Revendal. Her Opportunities
were limited, but she made the most
Lit them. Sumner D. Quinton as Quln‘
03' Davenport played as though it felt
quite natural to be a millionaire and
Kathleen O'Rellly, most Irish of do-
mestlcs. as played by Dorothy Tuttie,
added many a touch or humor lo lbc
somewhat somber home liie of the
Quixanos.
