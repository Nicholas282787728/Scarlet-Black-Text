SPIRIT OF OLD GRINNELL

IS PRESENT ALUMNI DAY
(Continued from Page One)

Griunell Day luncheon at the dermis
tor-res Thursday noon. ‘

Before the speeches, the men were
led in a number of popular songs.

Mr. Ray talked to the men about
their future relations toward the col-
lege and what it will mean to them.
lie compared the present times to the
days after the Civil war, saying that
the war sends back two types of men,
a careless and indifferent type and a
type who are active and are to be the
leaders in business and politics or the
nation He urged the men to dis
cover what kind of men they were to
be and follow out their ideals along
this line.

Spenbing of the progress of the col-
lege during the last torty years, he
said "The college to me as I remem-
ber it was a living spirit, but as I
see it now it is a quiclrcning spirit.
We live in a great age, but titty years
from now the times will have ad-
vanced so we will not know ourselves
unless we take advantage of the op-
portunities we have. We must work
to keep abreast of the times."

Emphasizes Value of English.

Mr. Morrison emphasized the neces-
sity of getting a good liberal arts edur
cation before specia .ing in technical
work. He impressed upon us the
great value or a knowledge of the Eng—
lish language both in business and so-
cial lirc

Lieutenant Hopkins told the men
that they could not appreciate Grin-
nell until they were where they could
see it from the viewpoint of an
alumnus. He said, ”Grinnell Day to
you docs not mean so ranch today as it
will later. The longer you are out,
the more it will mean and the more
you will appreciate the great spi t
which is instilled into all true Gri —
hellians. ‘Sons of Old Grinnell' is
more than a name of a song. We are
truly sons of Grinnell. dependent on
her as we are on our parents. A Grim
nell graduate never iorgets his cola
lege."
