Last year Grinnell was well l'elJI‘oV
sented at the convention in Cedar
Rapids. and Gl‘inllcll played a distinct—
ive port in the ﬁrst annual meeting
held at collox two years ago This
year should prove no ception. We
should send an equally strong delega—
tino to—wherever the scribes ieatheiz
Iowa City is anxious to cnteitain ttie
'19 meeting, but that problem must
be left to the directors. and that again
awaits the bidding of the indomitable
W. Earl or Iowa.

The convention has in the past
proved the greatest inspiration of the
year to editors and start members
alike. Suggestions, as well as or
cisnis, have been laid beiore the em-
bryo journalists by some of the great
est newspaper men of the middle west.
The improvement in the papers of the
last three yea —the new systems put
into use, the added icatui-es,7have
proved beyond a doubt the real value
of the convention. '

College papers everywhere are coma
in: to be recognized more and more
as the greatest organ for the reflec-
tion Of student opinion, and the great-

, est medium for the presentation to
students, faculty and alumni of sin-
eere, constructive criticism. It is
largely the press convention which has
brought and will continue to bring the
college newspapers u! iowa to the po—
sition they deserve in the liie or our
institutions of learning. '

COMMUNICATIONS.

The Scarlet and Elacli will welcome
communications on any subject from
any student, faculty member, or
alumna. The “What Do You
Think" column b a s proved a
desirable medium for the pre-
sentation of opinions, whether dealing
with the popular or unpopular side or

‘duestions. Until this issue. it seems
to have been flailing into the discard
We are anxious for its revival,

The only condition which we place
on the use of the column is the sign—
ing of all articles when they come into
this ofﬁce, altho the signature will not
be printed it so desired

While we cannot promise to run
every communication, we will en—
deavor to pi int all which are written
within the limits or reason, whether
or not they are strictly in accord with
our point of view, for we believe that
onlv by intelligent disci . sion and coma ,
pa n ot opinions can real progress
be ntztdc.

The conservative members, even tho
