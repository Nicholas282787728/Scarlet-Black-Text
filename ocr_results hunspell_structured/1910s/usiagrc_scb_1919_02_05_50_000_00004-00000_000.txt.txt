an hour and s hair, and when a truce
was declared neither side knew which
was the winner. The tresliiiren hiid
niannctl to initiate some new Meat-s
residents. it is reported, but the sopho-
nrci-es and juniors decided that the
* ‘ men themselves had not been suf—
iieicntly initiated. When the unsus-
pecting tiosh returned irom orator-in
practice they wsllred right into a trap.
As many as possible were caught and
Itlcrl in their rooms. The rest went up
to the third ilnor, where the most sere
ous engagements oi the war tools
place. Myra hood, the only senior-
iin the cottage, acted as r-eierce. At
ten—twenty an armistice was signed,
and by "second hliults" the warriors
weic all >lll their billets, aithoughl
some oi these were found to have
been “stacked" by escaped Freshmen
prisoners. -
