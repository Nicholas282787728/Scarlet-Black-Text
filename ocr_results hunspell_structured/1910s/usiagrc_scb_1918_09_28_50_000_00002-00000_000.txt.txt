VOL. XXVI.

The Old )Luag’cmt‘llt.

Several changes have taken place in
the directorship ot the Scarlet and
Black since last spring. Willard Osiur
cup and Herbert Codtlillgton, electedl
for the munagihg positions of this
year, have enlisted in the navy. Their
alternates, Max Eglort and Martin
Ramsey, can not serve on the papcr
this year.

The ﬁrst management continued a
policy of making the paper truly rape
resentative at student opinion. They
set p’standard which will be difﬁcult
for another management to follow.
Their alternates were fully in accord
with their purpose. Both managements
contributed to the estahlishment or a
policy, which allied c01lege"ntel‘esls
and ideals of a City newspaper news.
Their ideas were worthy 0f praise
Their work has set a standard wcll

The Gl'lnnell Scarlet and Black is
inching a special request of its road-

Those business houses having odvs. in
these columns have spent good money
to attract college trade. They are
thcrcrorc particularly well prepared to
care ior such trade in a courteous and

on the other hand, those business
