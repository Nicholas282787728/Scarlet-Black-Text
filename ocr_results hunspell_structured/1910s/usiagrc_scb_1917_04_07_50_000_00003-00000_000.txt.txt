“The most inn 1 ever had at a
dance," was a remark often heard the
day following the Sprince Dance held
the first evening or vacation in the
Men's Gymnasium.

This remark, following as it does a
dance given on the campus and under
the super sion of a student commie
tee working in direct conjunction with
the Dean of Women, seems to many to
mark a decided advance in the spirit
of Grinnclrs social his. The Student
council who promoted the plan feel
well repaid for their efforts, and confi-
dently expect that the understanding
that no students shall attend otfrcamr
pus dances, will become a point OJ
honor with the student body.

The dance itself was a. very beautiful
affa' - Decorations in the form of vari
colored streamers swung from the
center to the sides of the room. Brille
iant colored lights added to the festive
ity of the scene and Eppnl’s Orchestra
of Boone furnished most excellent inu-
sic. The attendance is said to he the
largest ever at a college dance in
Grinnell. The fact that it was given
as a purely college attair seems to
have been appreciated Invited guests
were comparatively few. Among the
faculty guests were Miss De Nise, Mr
Strong, Mr. and Mrs. Dotterweich, M],
Smith, Mr. Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Almy,
Mr. and Mrs. Ryan, and Mn and Mr

“Some of you will no doubt offer
your lives for your country as your
fathers did before you. Others of us
will have to remain behind, hilt none
of us can escape our portion of suf-
fering. Therefore let us enter into
this war solemnly and prayerfully.
This was the statement made by D
E. A. Steiner in his chapel talk Wed-
nesday morning “The important
thing is not 'how we can enter this
War,’ but ‘how can We get all! of it,‘
the speaker concluded.
