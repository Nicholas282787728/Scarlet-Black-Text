’ SARVIS SAYS BREANIZATIUN
Is WORLD’S GREAT PROBLEM

“What is the problem of the world
today?" was the question asked by
l Prof. Guy XV. Sal'vis, dean of Nan
King University, China, in a Vesper
address Sunday.

"First," he declared, "comes the!
problem of organization. The aim of
every man should be to institute oi»
ganization, to make nations uniﬁed
and thus to create a spirit of good
feeling and democracy between them."

"The second problem is to ikeep
things going. No matter what the
council at Paris decides, it is our
duty to do this: Each individual
should do his part to keep natiousl
uniﬁed." He declared that he ﬁrmly;
believed that the $1000 that Grinuell
gives annually to keep uh the Chris-
tian college at shautung does more to
preserve peace between nations than
$700,000 put into battleships.

"We must he brought into contact
with China in order to see her view
point. Teaching the Chinese to use
new products does not reach their
problem. They must learn something
that will make them better citizens.
Unless there is injected the funda-
menml aspect of oul‘»aim, the Chris-
tian ideal- this mutual sell-respect
cannot he attained," ,
