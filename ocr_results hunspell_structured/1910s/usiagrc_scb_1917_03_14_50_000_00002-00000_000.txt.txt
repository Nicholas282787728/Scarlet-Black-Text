"z't't‘the some time that he went on
record as wanting to encourage stua
dent government and student eoopeia
tioii, President Main yesterday morn-
ing appeared to discredit a student ins
stitution, in the opinion ol many. To
be more specitic, he objected to a

story on dancing which appeared in,

The Scarlet and Black on March 7,

This was not a reflection on the
college paper as some people were
want to interpret it. President Main
said last night that he did not intend
to c ’ so the paper for the story.

Anyone who understands newspaper
methods knows that editorial opinion
should not he expressed in news coir
nmns. Anyone who understands The
Scarlet and Black knows that it does
not put its own opinions and thoughts
into statements purported to come
from the administration. Opinions are
reserved for the editorial page and tor
reviews.

And so in the story on dancing we
were particularly careful that just
what was given out by the administra
tion should be included. President
Main has chosen a puhliclty depart-
ment to represent the administration,
and the story came from that source.
That what was printed was what was
given out was the statement made
three times during a discussion last
night by the one the story came trom.
So it the story was criticised by the
President it could retlect nothing on
The Scarlet and Black.

Once previously this year President
Main was under-stood to have criticised
The Scarlet and Black for a story from
the admi 'stl‘dtion, and peculiarly

enough that .tory had been passed on_

word for word by his chosen publicity
source. In that case it there was any-
thing wrong with the story 11o rcflec~
tions could be consistently cast upon
the college paper.

Last night President Main said that
he did not even intend to seemingly
criticise the college paper. Its worlt
has been very satisfactory, he stated.
He intended only to insist upon the
broad principles at “student coopera-
tion.” .

Carleton college h. evcied athlet-
ie relations with Griunell, according
lo an announcement made by Athletic
Director Hull‘ yesterday. The reason
given by the Minnesota institution is
that crinnell was unwilling to sign a
two ,ear tootball contract.

The immediate etlect oi the brealt is
the cancellation ot the Cal'lelmnGl’lll-
nell dual tracli meot which was to have
been held on ward lield April as. n
Coe»Gl‘lnnell dual meet has been :11»
ranged in place ot the Carleton con-
test, to be held at’the Cedar Rapids
tiaclt on the same date.

Grinnell has not as yet scheduled a
football game to take the place of tlic
Carleton clash which was set tor Nov.
17. Little dilticulti is expected in 511's
ranging a contest with some neighho
ing college or university.

Crinnell bad uttered the date men-
tioned above to Carleton, and it was
accepted by the latter school. Then
they wished to have crinnell sign a
two year contract which the local malls
agenient did not see lit to do, and ne-
gotiations were broken off. "Doc"
Hull, director of Grinnell athletics,
gives as reasons tor the refusal ol the
two year contract the tact that such
an action would give Grinnell hot one
big game at home during the season
of 1913. The local team would play
Coe, Drake, Carleton and Iowa on their-
home grounds under such an agrees
inent, ivliile Cornell would be the only
team ot importance to he met here.
Such a schedule was not to he de-
sired, so the matter has been dropped,
not through fear of the Carleton foot-
ball team, but in order that Grinnell
gridiron tans may see some big toot-
ball games in 1913.

Arthur G itiith oi Simpson spent the
week-end visiting friends in Griunell.
