By Speaker.

“I want to smnrnon you men to ac

opening words in his talk “Men \letr
ed." at the banquet tor the £00 dele

“This has heerr the sign tluilg out in
every great crisis ot the \lm‘ld's Instr

is calling ,vou, and what a country this
is tor you!"

Expresses Spirit oi Coiiii-rcneu.

Senator Kelly-oil's speech was the»
teature ot a large numher- or insprr
tional addresses at the Coirterence,
and summed up the uhole spirit or the
gathering, the moi-shelling oi the
Christian young men of the country

who have the courage oi their convic-
tions, who will stand up ior their prin-
ciples in the lace ol ridicule and pos

man who will tight the liquor trattic.
especially in the Democratic party, has
courage."

The speaker described the ideal hu-
man being, physically, mentally, moral.
ly, and brought out the {act that eha
actor is the most important requi e-
