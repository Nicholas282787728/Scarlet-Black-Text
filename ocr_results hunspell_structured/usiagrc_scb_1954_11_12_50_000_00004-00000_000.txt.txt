Fresh from their win over
Knox last weekend, the Grinnell
Pioneers will be out for their
second victory against Monmouth
tomorrow.

The Monmouth team stands
one notch above the pioneers in
the conference standings with a
record of two wins and five
losses. The extensive passing at-
tack of Monmouth will see
quarterback Schwinn on the
passing end and towering Al

Conference Cellar

Battling with Knox for the
doubtful distinction of Midwest
conference cellar dweller. Grin-
nell finally handed the basement
keys to the Siwashers, edging
them by a 20-14 mark at Ward
Field last Saturday.

The win was the first of the
season .far the pioneers and,
ironically enough, it came in
their finalhome game of the
season after two ties and three
reversals previously. Today the
home forces travel to Monmouth
for the final game on their
schedule. >

Before Knox ever gained con-
trol of the ball. Nick Ryan, per-
forming for the last time before
a home crowd, plunged over
from the ten yard line between
right tackle and end, climaxing

Grinnell after receiving the kick-
off.

Knox then took charge of
play and marched to the Grin-
nell two during the middle of
the first quarter only to be
stopped by a determined pio—
neer line on three successive
scoring attempts.

The Pfitschmen tallied twice
more in the second period as
Scotty Walker collected two six-
pointers on handoffs from Vic
hampelberg, both coming around
left end. Steve McCormick added
the extra point on both occasions.

Breaking through the scoring
ice, Knox chalked up their first
touchdown late in the third
quarter as Logan what-ton even~
tually dived over from the one
yard line. Quarterback Frank
Casey had been thwarted twice

Wharton finally found an open.

As the gun sounded ending the
game, the Siwashers picked up
their second and last marker of
the day. With a minute and a
half of play remaining“ Casey
passed to fullback Art Carlson
for four yards from the Knox
eighteen. However, the speedy
backfield man raced to the Grln-
nell thirty»seven before being
tackled.
