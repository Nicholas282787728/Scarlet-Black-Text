Pioneer Bookshop opening

Bv CHRIS NEUBERT

Downtown Grinnell will have a new neighr
bor later this month when the college opens
the new Pioneer Bookshop opens. The new
bookshop will be housed in the former soda
fountain area in Cunningham Drug store on
Fourth Avenue, which has been empty for sev»
eral years.

Bookstore assistant manager Harley Mce
llrath said the new bookshop will serve an
important need in the Grinnell community.
“There has been no downtown bookstore for a
long time,"Mclrath said.“We’ve received a lot
of support from people in town.”

According to President Russell osgood,
the primary goal of the bookshop is to “proj—
ectwhat we are... to do things consistent with
our mission." Part of being consistent with
that mission means provrding a place for any-
one associated with the college to experience
both the college and the community, Products
sold in the bookshop are intended to appeal to
students, visitors to Grinncll and community
members.

As part of the College's ongoing communir
ty outreach efforts, the Pioneer Bookshop wrll
sell books by local authors as well as college
memorabilia, campus photography and CDs

Requuements

students to get a diverse liberal arts education.
Second, the requirements act as a “gatekeeper”
mechanism,ivhith (in theory) discourages stu*
dents from applying for alternative education
tracks if they aren’t serious about following
through with them.

Yet because Grinnell has maintained the
gatekeeper requirements for decades, it's tin»
certain whether the distribution mandates at
tually reduce the number of people who apply
for study abroad, independent or double mar
jets. As l3illups noted, roughly 75 percent of
students meet the divrsional requirements to
study abroad and only 60 percent actually ape
ply to do so. “Grinnell attracts a certain kind
ofsmdent who is interested in all tasting and
seeing the different cirricular fruits from each
division." said Billups, who sits on the CUI'T
riculum Committee. Billups speculated that
the removal of the requirements will increase
the number ofdouble and independent major
applications.

Given the choice between proposals mnn-
datrng distribution requirements for all stu—
dents, formally approving the study abroad
requirements or nixing the requirements al-
together, the faculty voted 40 to 25 in favor
of complete eradication, starting with applica-
tions submitted next Fall.“This puts the pres-
sure back on advisors to make sure students are
following a liberal arts path," said Swnttz.

That’s a good thing. according to Eliza
Willis, Political Science, who helped draft the
proposal. She said it demonstrates the faculty
is “rerrsseiting our control"ovcr the curriculum
and “reaffirming our responsibi . as advi—
sors to students. “Students could try to find

of the Varsity News Stand, McIlrath said the
bookshop will also feature bestchcrs.Thc new
bookshop also, according to McIlrath, “would
be less academic and focus on regional history,
Iowa and the Midwest."

According to Osgood, the project is the tee
suit of about six years ofdiscussions that began
with the idea ofmoving the current bookstore
offecampus. But after talking to other colleges
that have moved their bookstores, Osgood
“concluded that it wasn't a very good idea."

Instead, the much smaller bookshop is bet

ing considered an “annex"ofthe campus book"

store, and will be operated by both Mcllrath
and Cassie Wherry, the current bookstore
manager.

osgood said the bookshop is still consid
ered an experiment by the administration and
that students are welcome to suggest changes
to the bookshop. “Tell them what you don’t
like," said Osgood, “The bookshop is there to
serve the community and the college." Cert
tainly, reactions in the community have been
incredibly positive, "People are very encom—
aging," said Mellrath. “They're glad to see a
bookstore again."

‘casy advisers,” she said,"butl think most peo-
ple conic here because they believe in getting
a liberal arts education that involves taking a
wide variety ofclasses."

Another impetus for change is the incrensr
ing presence of interdisciplinary courses at
Grinnell. The Expanding Knowledge Initia»
tive (EKI), which advances academic depart-
ment crossover, began two years ago and has
picked up momentum since then. “We’re mov-
ing toward EKI," said Willis. “Does it make
sense in that context to have the emphasis
placed on divisional requirements?"

The impact ofthc change may be different
for off-campus snidy as compared to indepene
dent and double majors. Exactly who will re
view applications and how the revrew proccss
will change is also still undecided.

While the requirements to study off came
pus (at least three classes in each division) alps
ply to all applicants, independent and double
majors applications are reviewed and approved
on a caserbyecase basis. smcc independent and
double major applicants are asked to make a
case for how their courscwork fulﬁlls a liberal
arts education, Swdrtz saw the divisional dir
versity requirements as more like guidelines
than rules.

“lfa student makes a four-year plan at the
end of their second year and follows it exactly,
there’s probably something wrong," swartz
said, “I really believe in the structure of Grin—
nell’s educational program — following a plan
and modifying it as you go along,"

“I think students will buy into the change,"
said Billups. “It's an example of self-gover-
nance, a positive step because the faculty trusts
students to make curricular decisions."

Many Grinnell students do not think their
daily lives in Iowa relate to illiything but the Six
square blocks that make up campusThat Iowa
might ﬁt into the global culture is, at best, a
dream. But last week, the global culture was
brought to Grinncll, thanks to the Organism
tion for African -Asiun Relations (AFRASIA),
a newly formed student group aimed at invesV
tigating and publicizrng Issues related to the
relationships between developing countries in
Africa and Asia.

Irll‘l Taylor, Professor oflntcrnational Rela—
tions at the University of St. Andrews, Scotv
land, spoke on Africa-Asia relations and trade
developments among third-world countries.
Taylor summarized the history of trade rela-
tions among developing countries on those
comments (commonly called southssouth
linkages) and discussed the recent global push
ofcapital investment in Africa from newly int
dustrialized countries like China and lndia.

AFRASIA member Phoebe Leung'09 said
Taylor’s visit was an important component in
the club’s establishment. “Ian Taylor’s visit is
giving us an introduction to the whole issue of
Africa and Asia," she said. “He gave us a very
general overview of south-south cooperation.
He was very helpful in mapping out what we
can do in the future."

AFRASIA was formed last winter break
when Smita Sharma ’08, Terry Bokosha '09,
Jumy Adekeye ‘08, Nmachi lidenma '09, Mark
Francis ’08 and Leung wanted to look closer at
economic relations between Africa and Asiﬂi

specifically how a partnership between Afri-
can and Asian countries could help African
nations further economic development

The group primarily acts as a for-um for
academic discussion of Asians/\fricau l'clar
tions. The six members critically cxdmine the
historical and current political and socioeeor
nomic tics ofdcvcloping countries on the two
continents.

“Things we have planned in the future are
a fulleflerlgcd conference... and we’re hoping
to collaborate on a paper that potentially could
be published," said Francis. Members hope
that the academic atmosphere of AFRASIA
wrll lend itselfwcll to organizing other events
like Taylor's, and that these speakers can help
expand on their studies.

But AFRASIA's purpose is not restricted to
academia. The group plans to use its findings
from research and organized events to collab—
orate wrth other student groups. "Grinnell is
a campus... that is really big on activism and
social justice," said lidenma, “I see our group
as filling up the gap in terms of studying the
issues."

AFRASlA's members are hopeful about
how their group will be received on campus.
“In Grinncll, we have a lot of potential for
investigation deeper into African relations
because we have a huge pool of international
students" said Leung. “There’s a lot of inter»
est." Members of AFRASIA hope it brings a
new topic of discussion to campus, something
its members feel is necessary and desired.

 

Pride

from p- l ballfundraiser.

According to Lindsay
Robinson '09, spokesperson for (goc. the
events are intended to both express pride and
solidarity within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender (LGBT) community and raise
awareness of issues that students face. Pride
events, she said, are an opportunity to “have
fun as a part ofthis community, erbe educated
about something to do with this community."

Pride Day, the predecessor to Pride Week,
was first observed in June 1970 as a day to
commemorate the Stonewall riots, which are
widely considered the birth ofthe modern gay
rights movement. Pride Day has since evolved
into the weekdong celebration that usually
occurs in the spring semester on college came
puses across the country.

This year's celebration will be especially
signiﬁcant in demonstrating the recent expan-
sion ofthe Grinnell LGBT community. In the
past year, students have created new LGBT
organizations such as QPOC and Bifocal,
increasing smdent activism and involvement.
Nechirilo credits this trend to the fact that
“the class of'o9 is really active in general"and
the cyclical nature of campus activism which
means “groups will come up and then come
down."

Students organized the LGBT Leadership
Council last year to facilitate this growth, Lest
ter Aleman '07, the founder and former head
of the council, said the community has bent
efited from the cxpausion.“1t's better because
each group can tailor its programming to what
other groups are doing so that way we can bet
ter collaborate.” he said. “We can also focus
on different areas of communitics that haven't
been touched on.”

The position of advisor to the SRC has
also changed. Once filled by an RLC, Direc-
tor of Multicultural Affairs Dotty Slick now
serves in this position. Slick was also pleased
by the recent expansion, “All of those particu-
lar [LGBT] groups fall under Multicultural
Affairs is far as promoting diversity and cre-
nt' g greater awareness and understanding of
the lies that affect these groups," she said,
“They also create a more inclusive community
here on campus.”

Despite these changes, Aleman does not
believe involvement of students outside the
LGBT community in Pride Week will be sub
srantially increased. “There is still sort of a
stigma attached to the LGBT community in
a way,” he said. “No matter how many venues
we use for advertisements, attendance rates, i
believe, will never change.”

Meredith Hughey ’07, a representative of
StoneCo, echoed this concern.“I like to make a
distinction between tolerance and acceptance,
where [Grinnell students are] more tolerant
than accepting a lot of the time," she said.

She noted that most of the year LGBT
groups have trouble reaching out beyond their
community, but the diversity of Pride Week
events offer the opportunity to include more
of the campus. “It's time to create events, es-
pecially during Pride week and Coming Out
Week and sortie ofoui larger activities, to have
events that span the specrrtim of interest leu
915," she said. "Without that you miss pockets
of individuals who might otherwise be “1’
