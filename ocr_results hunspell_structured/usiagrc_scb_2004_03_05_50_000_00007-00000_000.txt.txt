by Bradley lverson-Long 8r Kay Nguyen

Bradley: Midsems, you come too soon.

Kay: Don't worry, then comes spring break, sunshine and all that jazz.

B: More rhen, some splendor and tragedy.
American Splendor (R)

B: This indie movie based on an indie oomie book
stars an independent iconoclasr, Harvey Peksr (Paul
Gismarti), and follows his rise ro semi-notoriety.

K.- l-larvey writes boring accounr papers by day,
and articles on inn and literature by night. He stacks
up his ofﬁce with files and his apartmenr with LPs.
Then, in one of those light bulb moments, Pekar is
inspired to tmnslsre his thmeedimensional, alive-and-
wriggling life into six-panel comic book pages. The
result is Amm‘mn Splendor, with sll the splendidly or-
dinary details of an Amerimn dsily life reproduced
through a cranky bur humorous mind.

This is an adorable movie. A ﬁlmmoking couple.
Shari springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, made this
movie about another couple whose arrisrie inclination
transcends their mundane and trivial working elass lives.
When people are caught in a d:ad»end job, what dise
ringuishes n man from The Man is his reactions. lfyou
would wrire comic books out of a grumpy search for
lost files or work, then you're The Man, just like Mr.
Pekar.

Li lya 4-Ever (R)

B: The main goal ofmovies, like movie reviews, is
re enrerrain, right? Well, not all rhe time. Muny mov-
is’mission is not to plmsure but to inflict pain and
knowledge upon a receptive audience. Such is Lilya 4—
Ever.

This is not a Fun movie to watch. At all. Lilya is a
lG—ymr-old girl unable to survive in the poverty-stricken
former Soviet Union. Abandoned by her mother who
tries to go to the U.s., Lilya's lone friend is Volodya, a
neighbor boy also shunned by his parents. Against
volodya's advice, Lilya starts dating a man who decep—
tively delivers her inro a decidedly bad “profession.“

orrhe plot, bur I want you to go ro Harris informed
about the controversial, cheerless contenm of this movie.

K; Brad, do all Swedish directors make bleak en»
tertainment like this? I’ll have to make sure the next
Lukas Moodysson release in Grinncll is avoided at all
cost. Bur then again. it wouldn't hurt rfyour powerful

American Splendor,
Swedish sadness

Bradley really wants you to see the really depressing Ll'lja 4-Ever tomorrow in Harris

I'll just seek refuge in some 777m & 1m rspes on Saturday

B: I’ll admit, the timing isn't terriﬁc for a movie which is anything bur

escapist. But trust me, Lil/a 4.5” is so good, and ﬁts well with this

weekend's other austere artistic offerings. Pinter/75! and Baby (college kids
having babies scares the crap out orme). I mean, we’re in Iowa, why not
aeeepr being miserable?

Weekend of sound
Just two of the four concerts
happening in the next few days-
see the calendar for complete list

Hockey Night/Mahjongg: Friday

Mahjungg is a crazy band. Sometimes they like to go by
only their first names. Sometimes they claim that they are
not Mahjorigg at all but a band called Sexual Vietnam. And
sometimes they actually give the press information that's
not complete bull.

An introductory letter sent out to unsuspecting reporters
does not even give out that muth: instead, it's the bio of a
band called Standelle US with its name trossed out and
“Mahlengg” written in. The introduction of the bio doesn't
include names of the members or instruments played.

its as if only the people who actually go see the show
are allowed in on the details. Peihap: we need to a source
closer to home, say, a Grinnell student, to actually get the
truth. In the words of Concerts chair John Chavez '05, who
has actually seen them in person, ”They're a crazy band,"

with all of this misinformation, one has to wonder if the
band has a hilarious sense of humor that will make for a
really good live show or if the members of Mahinngg just
really don't like people.

out of all the mystifying hoopla, here is what might
attually be true about Mahiongg:

The band is made up of five people (four guys and a girl)
and features keyboards, violins, guitar, bass and no less
than two drums sets. "its really rare that a band will have
two separate drums Sets," said Chavez. "They pull it off
really well.”

”They play music in the vein of old Talking Heads and
stuff like that, They do a lot of covers and do old songs
from like the seventies, like David Bowie,” Chavez said,
adding, 'They play so much crazy stuff when they play
live.” for example, Mahiongg even did a cover of autkast's
”Hey Va” last time they played at Grlmiell.

Nahjongg will play with Hockey Night on friday, March 5
at 9 pm. in Gardner lounge. isophi'eﬂye

Azure Ray/T he Elected/Consafos/Neva
Dinova: Sunday

Athens, Ga. has produced such rock superstars as the
552's and R.E.M., arid one of the fabled city's newest
exports is coming to Gardner lounge on Sunday, March 7.
Azure Nay, a quiet, impressive indie duo, went west to
Dmaha and signed with the Saddle Creek label, home to
acclaimed acts Rilo Kiley and Bright Eyes. They will bring to
Griririell members of both of those bands in different
configurations, under the aliases of The Elected and
Consafos, respectively. A fourth band, Neva Dinova, is along
for the ride.

lohn Chavez, Concerts chair, says that this Sunday
evening concert will be the perfect windcdbwn after Disco.
Azure Ray is arenda rink and Maria Taylor; incorporating
romantic violins and banjos with synthesizers and subtle
electronic touches, their music creates a dreamy blend that
is at once challenging and unassuming.

Hailing from the other side of the country, The Elected
sound like their home base, los Angeles, Their sound
reﬂects their nrigins—Beach~Boy-esque guitar harmonies
meet eclectic, electronic beats. Chavez descnbes them as
”electronic folk-singers," and they are, reveling in their
complex mix of origins, iniluences and previous
experientes.

Consafos, whose name means "such is the way of
things,” has members from numerous indie groups, both
famous and obscure. Fronted by Stephanie Drootin, the
bands rich and guitar-driven sound ventures a little further
into rock territory than the other bands on the line up, but
just far enough that you can still hear the pianos, strings
and feeling in her voice that carry the group's melodies
along,

Neva Dinova, mostly a local art in Omaha, comes with
the burden or blessing of three guitarists, which makes for
a complex sound. Ambient touches and lyric delivery
reminiscent of 905 British rock make for music as dreamlike
as Azure Ray’s, but in a different way. If Azure Ray is the
dream where you are flying slowly, Neva Dinova is a little
more like the dream where you are falling ofi a cliff and
can't wake upiin a really good way.

The bands might sound a little like each other, but the
nuances in their respective music, combined with the
comfortable way they fit in with each other, may make for
four exciting sets. Chavez hints that there may be some
guesting on each uthers’ sets. Disco is over, mid-semester
exams are just ahead and in Gardner on Sunday night you
can blissfully float away from it all. —fmilio Garvey
