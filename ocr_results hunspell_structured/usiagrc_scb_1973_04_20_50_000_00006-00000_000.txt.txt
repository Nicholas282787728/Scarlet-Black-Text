’60’s See Housing Changes

:(Ed. note The story below, a his-
tory of Grinnell housing in the ‘60's,
is continued from last week’s hous-
ing history article)

by Kyle Schauh

A new option was introduced in
1961--the language huuse. The first
ones were German and Spanish
houses, and were occupied by wo-
men.

The Norrises were built in 1962
to accomodate the ever-increasing
enrollment. In addition to the lan-
guages houses, other offacampus
housing was now available to senior
men and women.

This reporter also talked to Miss
Sandra Hoth and Mr. James Hamil-
ton who were both graduates of the
class of 1965, and asked them to
describe their room draw experi—
ences.

Miss Hoth explained that there
was a lottery, with senior women
picking first tor the dorms on south
campus. Seniors then had the first
choice of rooms after the house prr
esidents and Baffle Board members
(similar to student advisors, butjust
for women) were situated. A few of
the dorms had integrated freshman
and upperclossmen members;,ot»
hers were still strictly freshmen 0r
upperclassmen,

Mr. Hamilton described the men's
system which operated quite dif-
ferentiy. The men still stayed in
the same dorm all four years, and
it was “rare when a student would
change,” Mr. Hamilton added, “Ea—
ch hall drewluts among themselves”

and then decided how the dorms WU»
uld be assigned. Usually this was
done by lot, with the seniors going
first,
This system did not change until
1968 when the campuses became
integrated. Women could then oc-
cupy South Younkers, Smith, Lan—
gan, Gates and Rawson, while the
men took over Loose, Read and
Haines.

Quotas
The class quota system also went
into effect this year to insure that
the more “undesirable" dorms wo-
uld not be filled entirely with fresh-
men, The student advisory system
was also set up for both sexes
to counsel freshmen. To accom—
odate all these changes, the first
allrcampus room draw was held to
pick rooms.
in 1570 the "Loose Experiment”
was initiated, and Loose went co—ed
by alternating room. The hall quota
system was still in effect as was
the lottery. Various other dorms
were experimentally co—ed by ale
terhating floors. The year—end eve
aluation of the experiment was
deemed a co-educational success.
As a result, the following year
offered only four single sex dorms
with the remaining fourteen being
co-ed by alternating floors or
rooms. The quota system was dmr
pped and rooms were then blocke
ed off for freshmen to insure a
certain percentage in each hall.
The remaining history is current
news and is posted at various points
around campus. In case you haven’t
looked, the age of the co~ed bath-

The most recent of these is in Palo,
Iowa which will begin operation such.
The central Iowa area, including Gr-
innell, has been pinpointed foraplant
in the near future, and John and Kathy
plan to petition the Grinnell city co»
uncil to take a stand against such a
plant. They will also contactthe city
councils of other towns in thisarea.

ISPIRG is alsu attempting a mura—
torium on nuclear energy plants in
Iowa, at the state level. A bill dealr
ing with this issue, initiated by
ISPIRG, is une of several currently
being considered in the state legiSr
lature, and ISPIRG representatives,
led by Skip Laiter, are lobbying
in the capital this week. Grinnell
students hope to join in the lobby
ing.

The other bills, which were not
initiated by ISPIRG but which are
receiving their support, are a unit

pricing bill which would make the
display of unit prices for various
products mandatory in all stores
carrying those items; a bill bau-
ning non-returnable containers, and
a bill to ban all semis past a cor
tain length from Iowa, because of
the destructive effect of increased
weight on the roads.

Mary Jane Wynn is still the Grin-
nell hoard representative of the state
organization, and Will continue until
elections for a new representative
are held later this spring. She is
Currently working on setting up
lSPIRG courses to be included in
the Grinnell curriculum next year.
These will be based on a format
used in ten Minnesota colleges, sp—
ensured by the Minnesota State Pub-
lic Interest Group (MPIRG), and
will deal with public interest grr
cups and causes, such as Nader’s
Raiders.

ISPIRG Announces Internships

ISPIRG has announced that it’s accepting applications for summer
internships from students interested in doing research on various
public interest issues in Iowa during the summer months,

Executive Director George Palmer explained here Wednesday
night that several $500 stipends will be awarded to students with
research proposals in the fields of energy conservation, consumer
interests, transportation planning, tax reform, farming and rural

development, and housing.

Palmer noted that ISPIRG, which had suffered from a loss of

credibility and energy in the past few months, is once againa
credible, dynamic organization.

He credited the positive shift to the organization’s narrowed
focus on specific issues in the Iowa legislature. Most recently,
the group has been researching and lobbying for bills to outlaw
55 foot trucks on Iowa highways and to ban non-returnable beverage

containers.

orinncll students interested in applying for the summer internship
program should contact Mary Jane Wynn, Kathy Kramer, or
Michele Rothenberg. Applications mst be completed and turned
