In attempting to evaluate the
accomplishments ot the Student
Council during my administra-
tion, it would perhaps be best
to simply list those things which
I feel are most important.

First. Lhe operation of the
Coke machlnes was set last year
on a sounder administrative ba-
sis; new machines were secured
and the profits supporting two
foreign students as well as one
student "operator were ,greatly
increased. Also, last year. the
council su mitted a rbookllst to
the bookstore in an etiort to
improve both the quantity and
quality of books. The results of
this are in evidence this year-

that student government nil~
nunlly subjects the college
program to review and mill-:05
some attempt to evaluate the
situation is a healthy sign, and
constantly keeps the inculty
and administration on their
toes assuring the student that
advantage will not be taken
oi him.

’ Some members of student govr
ernmcnt complain that it is user
less to lnvesilgztc anything
since the administration and the
faculty at , vs have the facts

which he can later "point with

ever, is mdde the primary or
solitary aim of student govern-
ments.

From time to time
things do arrse which the stu-
dent can act upon constructive

there is a dctmitc need to place
certain limitations on the idealr
istrc tendency and balance them
against a sandy scale of realism
This is my stand and I am sticko
ing to it.

student government which cor—

Action This Year

This year the council has con»
cerned itselt with the renova-
tion of KGRW and. through a
lengthy process of reports and
allocations of money, has sucn
ceeded. I feel. in laying the
groundwork tor a station of
permanence and quality.

The council also sponsored a
fall convention for the Iowa»
Nebraska region of the Nat-
ional student Association Al-
though this convention led ul—
timately to the withdrawal of
the council rrom NSA tfecling
that this group was mainly
concerned with problems per
culiar to large universities)
the convention did create a -
greater interest in student afr
fairs and the philosophies he-
hind student government.

Near the end of first semes-
ter the council reviewed our ad—
missions program and submit-
ted lists of students interested
in hclping with entertaining
prospective students on the
campus. Library hours on Sun»
day were extended on request
of the council in an effort to
alleviate the demand on outside
reading books created by the
44 course program.

At our last meeting the Stun
dent~Faculty Relations Commit
tee reponed, and the council
passed. several recommendations
to the faculty and administra—
tion. Some of these proposals
may be realized in the near fu»
ture.

Finally, the council this
semester has attempted to di—
versity its allotment ol lunds
in an attort to provide a num-
ber ol entertainment features
appealing to a variety. of
tastes How successful this ci—
rort has been remains to he

have been significant; perhaps

This leads me to my final topic
