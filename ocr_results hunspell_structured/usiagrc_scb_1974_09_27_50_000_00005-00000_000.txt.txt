Left—handed perspective

by Ted PI"ce

Scene: Tuesday night—Steiner
Hall, Room 27. Irving l\lelnitz, cub
reporter, is inter wing M x
who is the spokesman Ior the
Grinnell College LeIt-Ilailded
Community

“Mr, X what is the function of
this group?" asked Irving.

”Well Irving, our group was
Iormed primarily ior the purpose
of helping each other accept the

‘fact that we are left-handed."

“How have you gone about doing
this," queried Irving”

“We are trying to dispel the
oppressive mood which permeates
this campus."

“Mr. X, there are some people
who doubt that your group has
been seriously abused How would
you reply to than"

“It's quite simple Irving, I would
have them read:

iThe anti left-handed grafitti on

_ bathroom stalls in the library and
the forum.”

“Hmmmm. That sounds pretty
serious."

”Please don’t interrupt me,
Irving. 1 would have them \vitness:

iThe general assumption that
everyone is right-handed (How
dare they assume that I‘m right-
handedl I), Just go into any
classroom and you will see that
every desk has been made ior
righthanded people.

iThe constant disappearance oi
posters made by people who are
leftrhanded, Irving, have you ever
seen an announcement concerning
when and where our meetings are
held?"

“Well now that you mention it. . ,
I can't say I have "

”And another thing that bothers
us, Irving, is the thoughtless use or
indiscriminate language, Have you
ever noticed that when somebody
does something clumsy, people say
‘he has two left hands‘?"

”You have a point there," Irving
admitted.

“We have suffered from birth.
AS soon as Children have Inotor
coordination, people start jam-
ming everything they can into their
right hand, no matter how much
the children protest. This practice
has caused irreparable harm. Leit.

Smoke vote
’clouded issue

by Bob Handler
Facility rcporter
Members oi the iaculty voted
Monday to approve Beryl Clot
ielter's proposal to prohibit
smoking in all labs, classes,
studios, and seminar rooms. The
proposal also called Ior each
member to enforce the tentative
prohibition in class.
Consequences
Before the vote was taken,
questions were raised concerning
various consequences it the
proposal would be approved by the
administration. John Vogel, (a
nonrsmoker), was pessimistic
about the faculty making a rule
and then having to eniorce it. Ir-
ving Fishman, (a smoker), said he
would vote against the proposal not
merely because he smokes, but

.that he allows smoking in his

seminar classes where there is
adequate ventilation, His
colleague, Guillermo Mendoza,
countered Fishman by pointing out
that people who do not smoke are
still afiected hy the smoke.
‘Scnse oithe iaculty'
Secretary oi the iaculty, Anne
Abler, then suggested that the
proposal be voted on as a “sense of
the faculty" resolution, to be sent

$to the administration.

The proposal was narrowly
approved by a vote of 32 to 31, with

5 abstentions. ’

mainstreaming is o.

handed people have had to live

Avith that every day of their lives.

We're tired of it‘ We EXPECT
campus support. We EXPECT
everyone to become more sensitive
to the human needs and icelings oi
those around them every day. And
they have one month to accomplish
this, or else."

“What eiiect do you think you've
had on the College Community?”

“To tell you the truth Irving,
we've had a very poor response. I
can't iigure it out. Our demands
are not unrealistic."

“Well Mr, X, I wish you the best
oi luck. As far as I'm concerned
you have me right on your side,”

“Please, Irving. We don’t use
that word around here."

Iowa Library lniormation
Teletype Exchange (I-LITE).
The ACM periodicals Bank is
located in the Newberry Library of
Chicago, Under this program, a
teletyped request ior a particular
article is sent to Chicago. Two to
iive days later a photocopy oi the
piece will arrive in Grinnell.

I-LITE

LLITE operates ‘in a similiar
manner as the Periodicals Bank.
lt, however, is used to obtain books
not available in Grinnell's library
irom both public and academic
libraries.

According to Christopher
McKee, librarian oi the College,
the students use both the I-LITE
and the Periodicals Bank in
tensively. “In 1972-73," he stated,
“we borrowed 27,000 items irom
other libraries,” -

As another service to the
student, wcekly trips to Ames and
Iowa City are made on alternating
Wednesday and Thursday ai-
ternoons. During these times
Grinnellians may use the state

Longer hours

In addition to these special
programs, Burling Library oriers a
host oi other everyday services
that many students take ior
granted. McKee, ior instance,
pointed out that only one other
college in the nation is open longer
hours than Burling.

Experimental programs crop up
