A craft bazaar was held Wenesday and Thursday, offering students, faculty and staff the
opprtunity to purchase high—quality, handmade crafts at low prices.

Proceeds from the sale will go to the Mbalo Fund, which was set up to provide money
for two African teenagers to attend college in the United States,

Committee. was not too con~
cemed about a possible disruption
of the teaching atmosphere, and
seemed to feel that there would be
few problems ﬁnding replacement
classrooms. Locations being
considered include Windsor House
and the Conference room in
Hurling Library. Charles Duke.
Dean of Faculty, also proposed
using rooms in the PEC. Good-
now, the Reading Lab, Grinnell
House, the Community Center
and the basement of Nollen
House. Dorm lounges, such as
those in Loose, Main, and Gard»
nor, are also being considered, as
are the Forum lounges and
PDRst Renting rooms from
some of the churches surrounding
the perimeter of the campus is
also a possibility.

In terms of space, the
situation seems to be well under
control. However, scheduling
creates more difﬁculty, The ad-
ministration is aware of this
problem, but they have not dealt
with it yet, Until next semester,
the needs of each departments
will remain unknown Duke adr
mits that it is a complicated is»
sue, and that the planning will
have to be done very carefully.
But he is quick to add that it is
"the price we have to pay for the
renovation of ARH." He men-
tioned the possibility of schedul—
ing Saturday classes, noon—time
classes, and classes to begin at 7

am, However. he added that
none of these are ideas are partic~
ularly popular. and that they will
be used only as a last resort.

With the question of class-
rooms well under control, the is
suc of faculty offices must also
be considered. There are 20 of-
fices which will be affected.
These will be temporarily moved
to places like the cartels in the
Library, and rooms in Windsor
House. Goodnow, and other off-
campus houses.

The renovation will not
only modernize ARI-I. but will
also better equip ARH with in-
structional aids such as new audio
visual equipment. Duke come
merited, "About onequaner of the
cost of renovation will be the
cost for equipage."

Both Walker and Duke feel
certain that there will be no
negative effects on students or
faculty and the make-shift class-
rooms with which they will be
forced to deal. Neither of the
men see any real problems with
the inconvenience of a class in
the PEC and one in Grinnell
House ten minutes later. Walker.
looking at the overall renovation,
declared that "only good will
come from it." Duke echoed
Walker's words w en he said that
the renovation is going along
very well and that the end results
will be positive.

decision making.

According to Dan Tindall,
director of the Physical Plant and
Harris Center Committee mem-
ber, “The purpose of the building
is to serve two functions." First,
it will provide an acoustically
well-designed social area for par-
ties and concerts as an alternative
to Darby where the acoustics are
poor. Cathy Baldwin, chair of the
student section of the committee,
hopes that the social area will
provide space as an alternative to
North Lounge and Gardner
Lounge as well because these
spaces are quite small. Secondly,
it will provide a cinema to re-
place ARI-l auditorium. The new
cinema will offer better acoustics
than ARI-l and more seating space
than South Lounge.

The Harris Center will be
named after John H. Harris.
trustee and alum (1939). Harris

donated 1.6 million dollars for
the purpose of building a social
center designed for students,

Not only is the center de-
signed ior students, but by stu-
dents. Baldwin stresses that she,
as well as the other ﬁve students
on the committee, worked with
the architect to design a building
that will meet student needs now
and in the future. Space may be
given to GORP because it is ex-
pected that the organization will
need more space in the future.

An alcohol policy does not
exist for the building. Baldwin
thinks it may be similar to the
alcohol policy in Darby but no
decisions have been madct How
thc building will be staffed is
also unknown, Specifics about
the building are still tentative »-
as Tindall said, "It's difficult to
bc promising things at this
point."

 

 

 

Politics

has promised not to vote for any
tax increase during the next two
years. Mona Bond has made clear
her opposition to his stance and
apparently wants to increase our
taxes,

During the recent ambu»
lance crisis in Grinnell, as many
of you will remember, Mona
Bond called a meeting at the
Courthouse. There was a lot of
talk by Mona and others as the
television cameras rolled, At the
conclusion of the meeting, a lo-

cal Democratic official publicly
pointed out that nothing nao been

accomplished, and that the meet-

ing was a waste of time. On the
other hand, Phyl Tyrrcll, this last
term, took constructive action by
supporting legislation to provide
funding for rural Iowa ambu-
latices.

Mona Bond has talked
about education. Phil Tyrrell as
our representative co-sponsored
legislation that saved the tuition
assistance program and also voted
to save the work-study program.

The choice is clearly be-
tween tallt and solid leadership. I
want to encourage you to reelect
Represenlztive Phil Tyrrell on
