ed with a large score of over a
hundred against a Minnesota col~
lege. and remembering the 102 to

UniversityofMinnesota had hopes
of defeating us by avery large

year ago we made our ﬁve yards
only once. and held for downs not
at all. Last week we made our
distance. and held for downs
several times. This shows that

SCRUBS vs. HIGH SCHOOL.

Ona ﬁeld of mud the scrubs
and the high school tied in their
game Saturday, 5 to 5. Both
scores were ofthc nature ofﬂukes.
The two teams were about a Stand»
off. though neither played very
good football. which is accounted
for too large degree by the con-
dition of the ﬁeld. The high
school will have a good team.
though not the equal of its last
year's champions. The scrubs
were a motley array. there being
just enough on the ﬁeld to come

perfecting running plans was held
In l’rof, Johnson's room. Chicago
Hallat four ﬁfteen Monday. A
number of new members were
present to work right into the or-
ganization from the ﬁrst. In a
conference of this sort where a
distinct plan of study is followed
it lsimpossible to gain material
good by coming in during any
part of the year. One should be
there from the ﬁrst to hear and
take part inthe lectures and dis-
cusswns at hand. The courses of
history.politicalscience and socio~
logy were formerly in the college
curriculum known under the one
head of history. Later by the
separation of these three into dis-
tinct courses. something has been
lost. It is with this idea in mind
