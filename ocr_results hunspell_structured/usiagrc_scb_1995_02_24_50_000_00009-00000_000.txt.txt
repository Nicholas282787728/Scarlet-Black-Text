LETTERS
To the Editor

Minority houses ringer-tam,
butBurt’slogicts wed

This letter' is in response to the minority
perspectiveseditonal in thchb. 17 issue.
Columnist Tequia Burr wrote about and
argued for some very important issues;
primarily the issue ofallotting the Latino/
Latina, Asian, international and Jewish
snidents on campus their own respective
houses in conjunction with the BCC'S
existence. The idea is perfectly jusdﬁed
simply by lookingatthefact IhatCBS has
aeuttuml oerrter, and that it is unequal not

to provide these other groups with the
same. However, Toquia chose to argue
the position in a more revealing light.
First in response to some students’
reactions to the proposal, she comments,
“Some people attack them [advocates]
because they say that these students are
only trying to segregate themselves from
therestof the campus. Thatisounngeous.
These students of color only want a place
when: they can cornetogether with others
from their own culture and celebrate,”
Outrageous? Youareoutrageous.Tequia
Listen to yourself. Segregate as deﬁned

by Webster's Unabridged Dicu'onary
reads, “1. to separate or Sol apart from
others or from the main body or group;
isolate: to segregate exceptional chil-
dren; to segregate hardened criminals,"
Separation rs segregation. Recognizeitin
all its terms. ipersonaily don’t have any
objections to the appropriation of cultural
centers to those groups that need it. Ialso
can'tobiecttopeople's desire tosepatate
mentselves from this campus, based on
the fact that people do segregau: them
selves. Butlmustobjectto any supponer

Secondly, contrary to Tequta's sug
gested assertion that all black people dig
Palm, Ice Cube, and lodeci, they don’t.
Not all white people like Erasure and
nasty Velcro games either. To associate
those groups with those activities without
adrrutting they are generalizations is den.
germs You risk putting yourseitin the
same mind frame as the so—called “op-
pressors.”

Thirdly,Tequia‘slastpat-agmphealls
for a resolution. She admits that she
“cannothelpitifthewhiresnrdents on this
campus don'tcon-te to the BCC or sit ata
table with minorin people." She’s right.
andltotally agree. Shecontinues,“1thirtk
that the white students on campus should
stop segregating themselves from people
of color instead of thinking it’s the other
way around." How can you say that? As
a“vrctim"oftheperilsofmcism (asystem
of negative and positive generalizations),
how can you justify using generalizations
to support your opinions? Don‘t assume
anything abouttne bythecolorofmysktn.
Do not assume thatall white studean feel
tllat way and do not pretend that if black
students do it too tltzttil'ssomel'tow differ
cut and “okay." Don't play the blame
game. Relattonships, by their nature.
tnvolvc more than one person. it is never
possible to attribute anything within a

‘ relationship to solely one person. It is

necessary to see each individual/group‘s
role within the situation.

Toolong ithasheen that this system
of differentiation looms over our lives. I
want tacismtobenonexistent Inorderto
do that, major changes in the system need
totakeplace. Asaﬁ-iendsuggestedtome,
a minor change with probable benehs
would be to csmblish a true house of

3 calism aims to change the system simply

by switching the roles of the oppressors
and the oppressed, it doesn't change the
system At all. It continues to allow
people to get what they want at the ex—
pense ot‘others. And thatissomcthingthat
needs to be changed

tural groups had similar situations. How
ever, the term "houses" was used. which
leads one to think that all of the mhtonty
students will live together and seg-egnre

Committee, which consists of members
from ASIA, SOL. ISO and Chalutzim.
We have worked forthe past few months

on campus. It is SPACE that we are
looking for. not a house. The wording of
”space"andnot‘hottses"needstobeclear
irt order to avoid the confusion. We
presented our proposal to the Board of
Trustees on Feb. 10 with the intention of
getting adequate space. As of yet we do
not know whatshape this space willtake,
so we cannot yet call it a house or a
building. 'I‘heResoumes Committee will
continue to work to fulﬁll space needs.

Iwould also liketodismiss thebelief
that multicultural groups will “mks ovef’
current college owned housing. This is
nottme. 'I‘hecunentspace allocatedto the
groups is not adequate for meeting pur
poses, cultural celebrations and storage,
We are looking for space which would
alleviate these problems and continue to
provide suppon, a sense of conununt‘ty
and education for not only ourselves but
also tor the campus community,

On the same now. i would also like
to address the “segregation" issue. Many
people believe that the creation of space
rorrnuiticulnttal groups will lead tosegre—
gation. The proposal presented to the
board very clearly smtes that we would
like the space for the centre campus, not
ourselves. Weareloolong torinclustvity,

Fet‘rigno clariﬁes statement

Ilhirtk my letter published last week
caused some confusion. Pam Ferguson
states that Grinnell students are “highly
intelligent," because if they do decide to
leave Grinnell, they transfer to another
school to ﬁnish their education, rather
than quitting school altogether (as it the
students who quit school altogether are
not “highly intelligent").

Emily Ferrigno '97

are proud of this, but Jason and Jon are
happy for another reason: They got to go
to Rube’s withMau‘sl'amily. Free steak!

We asked led and ills Dad if they

but we ﬁnally found out Jed’s real
name.
