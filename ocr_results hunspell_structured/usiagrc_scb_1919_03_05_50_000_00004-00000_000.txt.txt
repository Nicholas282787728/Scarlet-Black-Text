off Beirut some days ago and it is as—
sumed that Hadley is still on board.

The letter follows in part:

I am very well and very happy to be
overseas at last, even tho I’m not with
the A. E. 1?, We've had a very pleaSA
ant journey for about (he ﬁrst half—
meaning that it is now a bit over halt
completed. We are 3,000 miles irom
New York, here.

Soup Sometimes overflows.

We lead a. very comfortable life on
board ship. olir quarters are rather
cramped, the cabins being only about
eight feet square. The bunks are two
icet wide, one above the other, two in
a room. A small washstnzid and a
bench take up all the rest or the room.
We eat at the wardﬂ‘uom with the of-
liners or the ship, and have very good
food. But the Ship rolls particularly
hard at meal time, out of perversity I
guess, and sometimes the soup overe
ilows its bowl

I way lying out on the gun nietiorln
this evening and saw the most beauti»
fill sunset. It had all the tints you
ever see in a sunset at home, but they
were many times brighter, and it had
a sombre shade oi dark brown shad-
ing into black which is new in my ex-
perience. The sailors said it is called
an African sunset, for only in that.
country around the Sahara desert can
it be seen. It is Caused by like pantie
