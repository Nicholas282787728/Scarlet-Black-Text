’Women to Get
Special Fund
for Recreation

Cottages to Receive Portion
of Semester Charges

for Parties

A five dollar recreation fec, similar

to the house dues paid by the men,
will be‘set aside from the semester
charges of Gn'llnell women, Evelyn
Gardner, dean of women, announced
at a mass meeting of the women in
the little theatre of the quadrangle
Thursday evening.

Nine women have been selected as
a committee to plan for the disposal
of the money. The committee, which
has already met three times, is head-
ed by Miss Gardner and includes Dor~
othy Thompson, Mary Wood, Irma
Cooper, Elizabeth Sherman, Betty
Tebbins, Mary June Miller, Louisa
Sargent, assistant professor of hot-
any, and Sarah Illness MacDonald, as-
sistant professor of piano.

Common Fund

Part of the fund will be reserved
in a common treasury to be spent in
the interest of the entire women's
student body. The remainder of the
sum will go to the individual cottages
to meet the expenses of house par-
'ties and open houses.

The committee has devised a ten-
tative budget which will be presented
to the women for approval some time
next month. According to this bud-
get, from the fees of the quadrangle
women, $3.00 each semester will go to
their cottage treasury, while 32 25 cf
the town women’s fees will go to the
cottage with which they are affiliat-
ed.

Entertainment. Considered

A general fund will be created
from the remaining 5200 of the quad-
rangle women's fees plus $1.00 each
semester from thc women living in
town, This money will be used to
provide better equipment for the rec-
reation room and to buy magazines
and books for common use of the
women. The possibility of bringing
some speaker or artist of note to the
campus once a year for the express
benefit of the women is also being
considered.

Twenty-five cents per semester
will be alloted from the fees of the
town womcn to go to their own or-
ganization. The remaining $1.75 of
their fee may be used to provide them
with tickets for five or six meals each
semester at the quadrangle, though
this has not yet been definitely decid-
cd.
Election Alumni-iced

In view of the coming elections for
president of the Women's Self Gov-
ernment league and six house
chairmen, Miss Gardner outlined
the general plans for the pro-
cedure. Monday, March 5, after
lunch, in the Main corridor, girls will
select from a list of junior women
one person for president. At dinner
the following Tuesday the nomi-
nations will bc announced and elec-
tions made from the three or four
women receiving the highest number
of votes. The nomination and election
of the six house chairmen will take
place in a similar way on March 12
and 13.

Sherwood Eddy, Author, Lecturer,

Named as Speaker1

In 1931-32, Dr. Eddy spent five
months in war-torn China at the re-
quest of Chinese leaders, in an effort
to atom the rising tide of Chinesc‘
communism. He reached Mukdcn,
Manchuria, shortly before it was in-
vaded by the Japancsc, and was an
eyewitness of the occurrences during
thc first days of alien occupation.
From leading citizens, he secured the
inside story of Japancse militarism
and intrigue in Manchuria.
Attended Conference

Last year, Dr. Eddy was in Eng-
land while the London Economic Con-
ference was in session, and viewed
events closcly there. In Berlin, he at-
tracted much attention among Ger-
man oificials and business leaders by
rebuking the Nazis for their treat-
ment of Jews, Communists, and uh-
erals, and challenging them to deny
his statemcnts. In, Russia (his tenth
visit there), he visited cities and
villages, talking with government of-
ficials, industrial workers, and
farmers.

Dr. Eddy has written numerous
books, the most recent of which are:
“The World's Danger Zone”, “The
Challenge of the East”, “The Chal-
lcngc of Russia", “The Challenge of
Europe", and “What can We Learn
from Soviet Russia?".

President Compton, of the Mass.
Institute of Technology, has said of
Dr. Eddy, “In his work among young
men in this country and Asia, he has
been one of thc most stimulating and
constructive men of this generation.
He has been a powerful influence for
good in international affairs, as well
as in the lives of individuals. Hc is

Santi, Manns Encl Careers
Will-i Brilliant Play

in Season Finale

Sweet revenge for a previous dc-
fcat and third place in the Missouri
valley circuit were the awards won
by the Grinnell varsity cage team
last night when the Pioneers drubbed
the Drake Bulldogs 31 to 14.
After the first few minutes of
play, the Truesdale coached team had
no trouble maintaining a safe lead,
building up a 19-7 advantage at the
half. With nine minutes of the sec-
ond period gone, the Pioneers lcd 25
to s and Coach Bill Williams of Drake
substituted freely.

Santi, Manna
At the end of the game, reserves
predominated in both teams, with
captain Santi siding materially in in-
creasing Grinnell's margin.
Santi and Les Manns, only seniors
on the Grinnell team, finished their
college careers by playing at their
best, the former being high man for
the game with 12 points. Dick Ma-
son, forward, was second in scoring
with six points, although he went out
of the game on fouls early in the sec-
ond half.

Rugged Game
Close guarding and tight playing
featured the first half, but both
teams wcrc ragged in the second
canto, and fouling slowed up the play.
Manns started the scoring in the
first half, with a tipin shot and free
throw. Curry gave Drake two points
with a short shot, followed by two
charity tosses which Manna made
good and Grinnell led a to 2. From
that point on, the Pioneers remained
well in the lead. Drake was held to
two field goals in this pcriod, Abram,
guard, contributing the second with a
tipin shot.

No Rally 1
A frce throw and a tipin shot by
Dick Mason opened up the second
half. The Bulldogs were unable to
stage a rally similar to that which
defeated Grinnell 25 to 24 in the first
game, and the scarlet and black out-
t'it coasted in without danger.
Grlnllell ended its season with a
Missouri valley record of five games
won and five lost, defeating Wash-
ington university twice and losing to
Creighton twice, while splitting the
two-game series with the three other

Poldi Mildner Prefers
Music to Mqrried Life

Poldi Milduer, 13-year-old girl pia
nist from Czecho-Slnvakia, who has
been touring Europe since the age of
11, will give a recital in Herrick
chapel Friday at a p. m. as a regular
number of the Grinnell recital course.
Semester fee tickets will admit stu-
dents.

The young pianist comes from an
undistinguishcd bourgeoisie family
which boasts no other musicians, and
her career of music was achieved
through the help of her mother, in
spite of the objections of a father
who thought a professional training
improper for Poldi.

After studying in Vienna for two
years under Moriz Roscnthal, the lit-
tle girl staying there one week out of
each month, Miss Mildncr gave her
first concert, in the Vienna concert
hall at the age of 11. She soon re-
ceived approval from critics and was
engaged to play with the Vienna
Symphony orchestra.

Poldi Mildner has decided that
she will not marry, because she be»
licves music and marriage would not
mix successfully in her life. “Music
is such a big thing in my life7 is
all I ever think of," she explains.
“Marriage ought to be a big thing,
too, And how could I fit two things
