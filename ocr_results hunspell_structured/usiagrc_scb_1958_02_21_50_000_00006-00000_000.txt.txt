' Mermen Journey To Mi. Vernon.

Meei Cornell ln lasl Dual Meei _

This afternoon the Pioneer
swimming team traveled to
Mt. Vernon where they will
meet the Cornell Rams in
the last dual meet before the
conference meet at Appleton,
WlS., March 1.

Grinnell is unbeaten in cane
ference competition, with vic-
tories over Lawrence, Carleton,
St. Olaf, Knox and Monmouth.
A victory ovel‘ Cornell will
give them sole . possession of
“Dilly the Duck." “Dilly” is a
wooden duck given in the past
to the team that won the con.
ference meet. This year the
conference changed the rule
and is giving “Dilly” to the
team that has the best dual-
meet percentage title in round-
rohin competition. A new trophy
will be presented to the team
winning the conference meet.

The only losses the yin.
neers have suffered have
been to non-conference fees.
The first loss was to Gustavus
Adolphus in a triangular
meet at Monmouth and the
second came at the hands of
the Air Force academy last
Saturday, 49-37.

The Grinnoll mermcn man-
aged to take only three first
places against the Air Force.
“At one time we had them 183]
but they took first and second
in both the diving and the 2007
yd. butterfly breaststroke and
we trailed all the way," said
Coach Irv Simone. He also
added that it was another one
of those meets where everything
rested on the outcome of the
last relay.

The Grim-tell team was met
at the Denver airport by two
cadet escorts. They were then
transported to their harracks
by the academy bus. There
were two cadets with the
team at all times to make sure
that they had everything that
they needed.

“I have never seen such hos-
pitality extended by any school,

and if there was over such a
thing as doing something right

they» really know how to do it,”
said cit-captain Jim Jacobson,
The school put on a picnic for
both the Grinnell team and the
Air Force team Sunday at the
Colorado Springs location. The
academy provided the Grinnell
team with regular academy
uniforms so that they wouldn’t
get their own clothes dirty or
torn. That afternoon they had
a snowball fight in 51-degree
weather.
