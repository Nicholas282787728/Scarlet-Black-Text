Spears lives on after Zywicki's death

by Howard Horn

Nyasha Spears is not unlike
many other students at Grinnell Col-
lege. She is ajunior History Major
and Pre-Med student from Bismarck,
Nonh Dakota. She has many friends
on campus and is a member of the
Women‘s Ultimate Frisbee Team.
Yet. through the tragedy of the vio-
lent murder to her close friend,
TarnmyZywicki,Spears transformed
from average student to courageous
leaderl

Late on the night of Tues-
day, August 25, Spears arrived in
Grinnelll At 1 am. thenextmoming.
August 26, there was a knock at her
door. Spears’ friends brought her the
news ofTammy’sdisappearanee. “At
first I thought I was going to faint...
It was like a bad dream," Spears
recalls. She didn‘t get much sleep.
By 7 am, the search for Tammy
Zywicki had already begun.

Since Spear's first day at
Grinnell, she knew Zywicki. Spears

described their relationship of that of
very good friends “[She was] very
friendlyandalotoffun." Spears also
described Zywicki as being very re»
laxed, easygoing, and a good athlete.
The news of her missing friend was
very traumatic.

For Spears, the best way to
react to this news was to get busy.
The headquarters of the search was
the home of the parents of Jennifer
Dowdl Dowd, 81992 Grinnell graduA
ate and probably Zywicki's best
friend, lived with her parents in Oak
Park, Illinois. Spears called Dowd to
find out what she could do, This
started the massive missing person
ﬂyer campaign.

From this point , things be
came progressively worse. The date
was September 1. Spears was work
ing in the weightroom when she got
a phone call. She was informed that
a body had been found in Missouri
that somewhat matched Zywieki's
description. By this time, Spears felt
she was no longer functioning prop~

erly. “I couldn’t hold a normal con-
versation.” She had become accuse
tomed to just answering questions,
from interviews with the press (that
numbered around 15 a day) to quesv

tions from students asking, “How
can I help?”

Then came what Spears
called the hardest day of all. Wednes-
day,Septembcr2,wordhadjusteome
that the autopsy results would not be
conclusive untilatleast Thursday. “I
criedalot,”Spearsrecallsofthatday.

On Thursday morning,
Spears went into town to distribute
flyers. She described herself as be-
ing“on cruiseconlrol.“ Shejustkept
busy until the autopsy results posir
Lively identifying Zywicki finally
anived. By then, Spears had no more
tears left.

After tragedy, life goes on.
In order to cope, Spears talked to
friends,putout flyers,and unpacked.
“Before I went to the funeral, my
adviser, Victoria Brown told me,
‘Clean your rooml’“ Spears said the
funeral was, “very hard, but it was
good to be with the Zywickis and the
Dowds.“ It was the first time that
Spears cried sinceSeptemberz. Also,
Spears has started to catch up on her
studies since she neglected them
throughout most ofthe time the trag-
edy was unfolding.

ThefactthatZywickiisnow
dead has not kept Spears from being
active. One of her main objectives is
to find out who murdered her friend.
Thus,flyer distribution continues, In
addition, Spears has helped to create
Fearless,a new organization on cam-
pus established to deal with Lite is
sues brought about by the tragedy.

Fearless‘s first meeting took
place in the Forum Coffeehouse yes-
tcrday at 8:00 pm, One of their ﬁrst
objectives is to introduce a bill in
Congress to erect mandatory
callboxes at every mile on the inter-
state. Spears claims that the price of
this action is not that high.

The other major emphasis
of the group is,“raising awareness on
how society is living with fear."
Spear‘sorganization was established

to show society thatwomen are forced
into sexism by having tomakegcnerr
alizationsaboutmen. In otherwords,
mainstream American culture is op—
pressing women by making it so that
women cannot trust men. Spears
says that this is not men bashing, but
the case of, “a few bad apples spoilr
ing the whole bunch." On a plane
ride, Spears recalls a man telling her,
“All freshman women must take
mandatory self defense classes and
should not be allowed to walk in
groups of less than four." Why is it
that the role of stopping violence
against women must cut into their
rights? According to Spears, no one
would ever expect men’s rights to be
diminished to protect women. For
example, no one would expect men
to have a curfew in order to stop
random acLs of violence against the
opposite sex.

Another issue of concern
for Spears is the poor handling of the
case by law enforcementauthorities.
“What Grinnell did was spectacular,
but we shouldn‘t have had to do it,"
Spears said of the hunt for Zywicki.
Instead. the massive work done by
Grinnell students should have been
done by the police. It was Grinnell
students who contacted state police
departments nationwide to inform
them of the missing person. This
effort was aided by the press. Spears
said that the Zywicki story was given
more press in Illinois and Iowa than
any story since the Persian Gulf war
with the exception of political cam-
paigns, It took the Illinois police
department several days to confirm
foul play which delayed theiraction.
During that time, no official missing
person ﬂyer had been designed.
Again, Grinnell students took theini-
tiative, creating and distributing a
flyer of their own design. Spears
wonders wharwould happen ifa miss-
ing person did not have a large sup-

port group.
