Students confer at Kansas State

Grinnellians who traveled to the Conference on Black Student Government had mixed reactions to the weekend‘s focus and events

by Diiara Yarbrough

Ten Grinneli college srndenu were among the approximately
800 attendees ofthc Big XII Conference on Black Student Governe
mcnr. which rook place ar Kansas Srare Universiry Feb. 19 ihrough
ZZ. Grinncll students in attendance had mixed reactions to the cone
ferenea, iangmg from ambivalence to disillusionmcnr to excitement.

“The conference really opened my eyes ro how far America srill
has to go in terms of resolving racial conﬂicts and discrimination
againsr eerrain racial groups,” said Yvonne Palm ‘06. Many people
think that the struggle is over and these issues have been solved, but
as many ofthe speakers poinred our rhrough rhcir experiences and
rhe experiences of those they inreracr wirh, we srill have a long way
ro go before we om make such a claim."

“After coming back, I feel energized, and excited to give my at-
renrion to rhe Challenga we were given," said Amy Chinanzvavana
‘05. “The purpose ofrhe conference was to promore leadership and
empowerinenr among blacksrudenr governmcnr organiaaiions. The
rheme was learning from our par to conquer our furore where basis
cally we would discuss rhe need and ways in which black srudenrs
could use their education to become leaders in their communities as
well as work rowards consnucrivc change."

Ned chy ‘04 said til: conference fell short of its mission. “It
wasn't as organized as I would have liked for it to have been," he
said “[And] beyond the keynote speakers and their addrutses :t| breake
fasr, lunch and dinner, rhe workshops weren't oondiiered in a man.
ner that lived up ro rhe mission ofrhe conference."

The conference consisred ofaddresses by keynore speakers dur-
ing meals, as well as small group workshops. “There were a variery
ofwerkshops ro choose from wirh ropies ranging from rhe porirayal
ofAfrican American women in'hip hop videos to AIDS in Smith
Africa ro economic empowermenr for blacks," Levy said. Keynore
speakers for mu year's conference included Dick Gregory and Elaine
Brown,

“The keynora speakers ar rhe conference were challenging us as
younger people ro go our pursuc more knowledge and use rhar
form ofernpowcrmcnr ro enacr change in wharcver community we
come From," said Chinanzvavana.

Guerrero was frusrrared wirh orhcr omissions she said sremmcd
from rhe influence ofchrisrian ideology ofrhe conference. “A lot of
rhe conference wau booed on religion," she said. “We prayed ar every

meal. Everything that had ro do widi spn-iriial empowermcm some. .

Guerrero said that alrhough she respccrs rhe religious praenccs of
Chrisrianiry. she found invocation ofrcligion ar rhe conference coun.
rcrproduenve. When facilirarors invoke religious ideology, she said,
“rho leave our a whole group of people. And nor yusr people, bur

“Wc snll have a very long way ro go as far as being leaders for
