As you might expect, it was
quite a Scene in the Grinnell
dressing room after the victory
over Coei

As the gridders £00k nit
their mud— and blood—stained
jerseys they broke into the
Grinnell Hymn followed by a
mayor and the Doxology.

A Presbyterian minister who
had graduated from Coe and
was recently called ‘back to Ce-
dar Rapids congratulated the
members of the squad on their
ﬁne team play.

Al Fisher's heard was the ViC'
ﬁlm ‘of most of the Grinnell
players as they took the scissors
to his stubble-covered chin.

HOW does it feel, after a
decisive victory over the non—
ﬂex-ence champs?

Coach Bob Peterson said, “I
don’t know what to say. They
proved a lot to themselves and
more to Cue."

The faculty representative on
intecouegiatc athletics, James
Stauss, declared, “I’m not much
of an authority but it was a ﬁne
game. I extend my congratulaa
tions to the team and the
coaches."

Bruce Wilkerson and Bob
Grindey both put this game
above the upset of St. Olaf
they engineered last year.

End Lee Moses, who caught
three passes in the game, said,
"I’ve been on teams that have;
won more games but I’ve never
been on a team that has won
so much."

Jim Simmons, the other Pica
neer end, who gathered in ﬁve
passes, commented, “We went
out with a bang!”

Gary Nolder. tackle, said, “I I
had the feeling all along that
whether one was in last or
ﬁrst place we were going to ,
beat them.”

Bob Weitzman, who was
“kicked out” of the game cone
tending to the end that he didn’t
throw a punch, said, “i think
for the second time this season‘
the team played up to par. We
had great defense and an of-
fense that really moved." ,

Both oi the oil-captains—
John Copeland and Dave Van
AnNmy—had a lot. of praise
for the (calm “Van" said that
he twas more proud of being
a captain of this team because
of the way they played this
game than if they had won
the conference.

“I think,” he added, “the thing
that united us was God.”
“Cope" stressed the fact that‘
it was a team victory. He said,
”some of the Grinnell Students
don’t realize that the guys have
a hell of a lot of guts. They
are deserving of a lot more]
support."

Belcit took the No. 5 spot,

Dave Pcele of Beloit ran away

Peele was far out in front of

Captain Chuck Yoak was sev-

Lewis Sachs in eight spot. Art
Risser ran loth, Fred Boughey
nabbed 15th, and Grant Fair-
banks and Han Lutter were 19th
and 20th, respectively. Merrill
Miller ﬁnished 30th in the 62-
man ﬁeld.

The closeness'of the barriers

was the determining factor in

the meet as many teams had

one or two top-place runners
but their fourth and ﬁfth men
ﬁnished so poorly that their
point totals were high

Coach Simone, collecting his
third conference championship
in a row in three separate
sports, was very pleased to see
his squad come through as it
did.

“It just goes to show how
much difference determination
makes, regardless of the cira
cumstances,” said Simone.

Simone said that he was proud
of all 10 team members and
thought that the boys "down-
the—line really helped to pull us
thrcug

A combination of hard work,
determination, cooperation, and
excellent team spirit paid ch in
the long run. Both coach and
team agreed, “When we bent
our knees and hung tough, we
came home with the bacon."
