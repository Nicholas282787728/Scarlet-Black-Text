Bourne: a triple threat

Matt Damon’s amnesic spy trilogy reaches a satis—
fying conclusion in entertaining final installment

If you loved the first two movies ‘in the
Bonnie trilogy (Bennie Ir/ttn/i/y and Bﬂln’lll'
srrpmnuty), you will ﬁnd plenty to like in T/zd
Bum/lt- U/lI/llzl/Illll.1f(iiosc two failed to excite
you, there may not be a lot here to entice you.

an elite government assassin, continues his
struggle to re-
claim his past.
Amnesia robs

step of the way.

As in the other two movies, most of the

Bourne Ultimatum
(2007)

entertaining to warch

The camera work has landed on a happy
medium after the first two movies it’s still ki-
netic and ll]*)’0llr*i}l€e, but not so shliky that
the fights hecorrru hard to Wall; Tire action its
sclrishrurrllyrealisriclr: ritshingcharrge
from the slick explosion-laden fare found in
most action movies.

The plot feels tl little bit like
ground we've traveled before,
hur it's still righr enough to keep
things moving at a good pace.
The script makes some hoki
themes with characterizations,
hrrrlrer dil‘rcrcnriaring itself from rhe srcarly
srreum or junk Hollywood pumps inro the ac-
tion genre. it's a delighr to rind a screenwriter
who understands how to layer hackstory with
a few choice words or a meaningful look, and
knows when to stay our ordre way and let the
plor carry itself.

Did Tor Hermie Ullillm/ulli change my life?
No. But it’s :1 fitting conclusion to an excellent
set of movies, and I left the theater feeling like
it was two hours well spellLTo me, that's rear
son enough to carch the movie.

Listen and try not to throw up

The press quotes for Caesar Pink and rhe
Imperial Orgy's Gorpe/ Hymm for Agnurtv'r:
artriAl/Jemt suggested that the album would
leave us with “a spiiitiial and sexual tingle“
or possibly he “as annoying as a spike in the
eardrum." The truth, however, is much less
hyperboli It's not excruciating, it's no
lutionary, it's sure as hell not tingly—

bed,

Pink and his record compltny make a big
deal about the "controversial" nature of his
music, claiming that he’s been banned from
multiple college and mainstream radio Sm-
tions. We posit a ditferent ieason: no sellin—
speeting DJ would play this crap. lnsreatl of
heing blasphemous or even edgy, Pink sounds
like he found an emo 13-year-old girl named
Lisa's Ltvcjorrtrral and set it to niunic.

The album opens rvrth a song called “The
Amazing Tenacity ofjob and His Brethren."
Twenty-rue seconds inro rhis mrrmhly some-
thing, we came to a conclusion. “This is really
bad.” The fact that it wits recorded in Tin
Man Studios is coincidental considering it
sounds like it was recorded in an empry can
orcreamcd corn—oh, and it's really corny

song two, “In Praise orShadows,"contirr-
net the trend of pairing lackluster melodies
with banal lyrics (and yes, we are trying to act
as pretentious as we can). The song is about
ravens and school boys and writing on chain
link fences (which we don't even know is pos»

sible). By the time we got to the line “So has
sanna hey-sauna what do we do now?" we
were ready to get the hell-sauna out otrhere.
However, it does sound kind oflikt: a really
emo John Mellencamp, so it might not be so
ind if you were really, really high.

Track three. “So It is," might be the
worsr song of rhe tour. The lyrics improved
slightly, but Caesar Pink attempts to create a
thoughtful piece or “SouthrAfritan Towrr
ship musie"7his description, not oursithat
comes out more like a pseudo-Caribbean ska
Led Zepplin-esque mess. Also, about half»
rmy through the song, we realized the lead
singer has a noticeable lisp. Wlulc it might
work for Modest Mouse, Pink just makes it
annoying.

By the time we gor around ro the fourth
and rrnal track, neither of us were really lis-
tening anymore. Pink claims in the song that
“this is (lit best we can do."1f this is true,
Pink needs a newjob. Or a new life.Wliich
kinda sucks for him,becausc he’s an atheist.

If you happen to see or hear this album
anywhere, avoid it like the mutant cold virus
Caesar Pink is not the worst music ever, but
he’s not witty, he’s not edgy, he’s not cool or
even slightly fun. In the end, Caesar Pink
and the imperial Orgy are bad enough to
convince us to repent our sins and return to
the Lord. Amen.
