Lowden Gives History of Famous
Grinnell College Faculty Club

“About seven years ago." stated hiiss
Eleanor Lou-den. of the English de-
partment, “the Grinnell raculty club
was organized upon the Grinnell cam.
pus with the old Rllnd home as its
hcadquarte This house. located
across the street from the r, w and
Y. blllldtug has an interesting his-

as it was the home of ‘lr, Little,
father»in—lftw ot lir. Macy. a former
president oi Grinneil college: later-
the house was turned into a hospital
by Dr. P. Soniers- then was used by
the college as an annex to the quad-
rangle."

Toda fire women of the faculty,
h iss sara lnnis McDonald. aliss Eliza
Curtis, hiiss Brucia Dedinsky, Miss
Helen Campbell Wliinrns, and liiss'
Clara J. Andersen live in the faculty
house, while l'ronl ﬁfteen to twenty
members dine there regularly. As a
center of social life, the Faculty club
is very popular. rcmarked Miss Low-
den.

The membership of the organizer
tion, which was originally founded for
unmarried members of the faculty, is
today open to married facility menr
hers as well as local trustees. The
membership fee of ﬁve dollars admits
the members to meals. teas, and social
affairs. Almost the entire faculty now
belongs, with the exception of perhaps
five. At present, Prof. J. P. Stoops is
president; hir, Paul Knight, treasurer:
Mrs. Charles E. Payne, social chair—
man, and Mrs. Edward A. Steiner,
chairman of the tea committee,

A regular social program during the
year consists of teas held at 4:30 each
Wednesday afternoon, and a regular
monthly evening gathering. Musicals
or an address by some faculty mem-
ber, furnish entertainment for these
affairs. Special teas are held at
Christmas time, on Washington's birth-

day, for the alumni at Commencement
time, and for the ministers during the
annual conference here. Early each
fail, a tea welcomes the old and new
members.

At the time when the Harvard-Ex-
'chftnge professor is in Grinnell, he ad-
dresses the group informally. This,
then, forms the‘regular social pro-
gram for the organization which has,
in addition, its informal gatherings at
various times during the year. A club
within the club is formed by the group
whose members eat at the Faculty
House. This group at Christmas time
holds a grab bag party.

“And, mentioning meals," Miss Low-
den added, “reminds me of the fact
that our present manager, Mrs. Adam-
son, deserves a great deal of the credit
liver the‘ present popularity of the club
because her excellent cooking especi-
:ally attracts people to the house.

“inor the past [ew years her efficient
lmanngement of the household affairs
at ‘the cluh and her excellent cooking
have made. the dining room popular
with married as well _as unmarried
lfaculty members. Therefore, her
‘share in making the organization suc—
«cessful should not be overlooked nor
=underestlmated.

"Thus," hliss Lowden points out.
"‘the faculty is banded together more
closely by this organization which fur
nishes a means whereby new faculty

rangle editor for the publication,

Miss Kingery is it sophomore and
was elected to the reportorial stuff
or the paper during her freshman
year. She has contributed to the
Tanager since coming to school, and
is as present tine of the assistant edic
tors of the magazine. She is also

presidentrelect of the Writer's club.

Grinnell has Hensley with a record of
ii feet, 6 inches, and Miller of Wash-
ington is a good outdoor vaultcr, ale
though he didn’t show up very well
at the indoor meet. Dodge and Cur-
bin are the Aggie pole vaulters the
former being the best at the present
time.

Another Washington athlete, Glaz-
er, looks like the most consistent
weight thrower in the conference. He
has put the shot more than 43 feet
and is also a good javelin thrower.
Little is known of the other weight
men in the conference. sivsrtz is
the Aggie threat.

An interesting question which has
arisen regarding this year's meet
is in regard to the track and
field records of the conference, The
question has to do whether the five
schools now making up the Missouri
Valley conference should adopt the
records which the old conference
made. Most of the trnclr coaches be-
lieve the proper thing to do is to let
the marks made May 24 and 25 make
up the official conference records and
use them as a basis for future meets.
