What Happened?

by Lois Harrison .
Most columns written to the editor are
lung Considering the amount of iocus on

the subject at hand, I didn't want to write a .

lengthy commentary, merely a reilection
on the applicability oi the “questioning"
process. .

A little over a week ago, several million
Americans became unfortunate observers
oi televised tragedy: the explosion oi the
Challenger spacecrait and the subsequent
death of its seven passengers.

It is now one week later. and the atteri
math oi the Challenger explosion,‘ i
suspect, still rests unsettled in the minds of
many people. Morbid repitition oi the blow
by blow details of the event by various
forms of mass media have caused a
substantial amount of people to focus on
the irustratingly simplistic question “Why
would such an event ever occur in the first
place?H

The struggle to reach a neat conclusive
answer to this question bothers me. Coir
sidering that the shuttle’s flawed mission
is now considered past news makes no difr
ference. The inability to reach an answer
brings up the iocus oi this article instead:
that answers to such simple questions
don't become obvious Ior some time, if at
all.

The response just given is not meant to
be a iiippant remark to such a horrendous
tragedy. Rather. it is instead a rcilection
oi iour years' practice oi questioning while
at Grillnell Four years down the lille. as I
see it and the ability to coldly and
analytically find answers to the inex-
plicable is still too tar out of my grasp,
Yet. it was not until I thought about this
certain event that I realized how far I had
to go in attaining the successful-answerrtor
the-questionrprocess. I had always assume
ed that the answch would be there when
needed.

During my treshman year at Crinnell,
an obviously enlightened senior said to me
“Don't worry about what you question
while you are here. Pretty soon you'll start
to question everything and then you'll
iiguro out not to pay attention to
anything," Liberal Arts education being
what it is. l spent some time trying to

figure out what he meant, and then moved
on to a new subject with equally puzzling
questions

Given‘a iew months, an interesting pat-
tern started to emerge, which went
something like this: Question only those
things that demand an immediate
response and chalk the rest up to
something to get around to later on. Given
Grinnell's apparent isolation irom the real
world — pressing academic questions
time’s calculus problems for example,)
took immediate precedence over the little
eccentricities of the world outside Grinnell
that make the headlines of daily
newspapers.

The inability of the Challenger flight to
get beyond ll) miles oi clear blue sky was
one such real world "eccentricity”, More
than that. it was a textbook example of a

. question that presumably should not have

been raised at all Growing up on a str»
mg oi space iiight successes, the deaths oi
the seven crew members aboard the space
crait was an abrupt anomaly to the routine
oi space exploration. The iact that neither
NASA oiiicials or iormcr astronauts could
oiier an explanation as tn why the event
occurred only muddled and obscured the
process which I had iigurcd was reserved
only [or those ot us still struggling with the
calculus problem in the previous
paragraph,

in summary. the tailurc oi the
Challenger flight posed diiiicult questions
which iour years oi college could not and
cannot summarize into a neat little
package. Horrible as it may sound a that
is a blessing ii ior nothing else. the
Challenger mission caused us to actually
ponder some oi the things that we so rarely
question. the iragiliiy oi so-called routine
events, tor example. the limits oi
technology or the strange emotions accom-
panying the news oi the explosion

More than likely, i would suspect that it
caused some oi its to question what lies
beyond the scopc at day to day existence
that we lead in Crmnell. iowa.

i-iopciully that type ot open ended quesi
tioning is a hell ot a lot moi-c important
than reaching an answer to a calculus pros

The Human Element

by Jim Duncan

it was an atypical study break.

1 descended from the last step slowly,
Burling Library basement. My mind
registered this . . . just barely.

I clumped quietly across the thin carpet
in my blackened and cracked leather high-
tops. The shoestrings trailed along behind.

I paused tor a moment in front at an oil
painting holding itseli flush against the
wall. Artwork, My brain glazed over this
astute observation . . . justbarely. As I was
about to turn away, I felt my arms, unbid-
den, rise and adjust the picture so that it
hung askew,

Gray matter. like an openrmouthed
drunk passed out in the rain-swollen gutter
in iront oi a sleazy downtown bar, drown
ed. The rushing flood of calculus had been
too much for my study-intoxicated brain.

My body hardly noticed the passing
away oi its head honcho.

I had “straightened" two more pictures
when my 6' 4" irame suddenly lurchcd to a
halt. Low rumbling issued from inside.

“BATHROOM! " my bladder suddenly
screamed I began shuiiling along in the
general direction

"BATHROOM"' my bladder screamed
again, this time with real urgency

I ran,

I was sale and sound. sitting comtor»
tably on the porcelain goddess attending to
my husmess when my brain shook off
death’s grip and came to tile again. I took
stock oi my surroundings,

The gratiitrmarred stall walls rose on
all sides. Hector grinned mischievousl).
and i began to read

i must not have heard the guy come in,
because the tapping on the hollow
aluminum partition‘ between us was the
first souiid to lift me from my engrossmeni
oi the surrounding literature

His stall door swung in. metal banged on
metal. and water began running in one oi
the sinks. I bent forward at the waist, try»
ing to get down low enough to see some
ieet, Fear shoved my heart into my throat

as I suddenly was shocked to see. not six
inches irom the ilimsy door of my metal
cubicle, two hiking boots. their toes iacing
toward me. My eyes blurred and I envi-
sioned the sound of a chainsaw starting up
or the screech oi metal claws scraping
metal. I saw a headline stating. ”Student
found mangled, authorities puzzled "
Then, the boots walked away. The muted
roar oi water irom the iaucet died away,
and the boots strode heavily across the tile

, ed iloor. They paused. . , i waited, tensed .

. . and the hushed sound of the door open-
ing reached my ears. I relaxed,

And the lights went out.

I came Close to dying right at that mo-
ment.

The door swung shut It was black. atr
solutely black It was blacker than the
blackest,

There was evil waiting for me in the
black.

I began to hurry about my busmess,
thinking the entire time with panic. ”I
don't want to die with my pants around my
knees!" I finished, stood. pulled the lever
that would bring the roar. and lifted my
jeans up around my hips. “I-Ie's ready for
me. but I’ll go down lighting," ithought
somewhat hysterically. Fist cocked, l pulls
ed the stall door inward and crept out, my
leit arm outstretched, ieeling cautiously

Sweat iormed on my upper lip as i
gradually moved in the direction of the
crack oI light shining under the door. I
stopped, listened intently to the black. and
edged on,

An instant later. my leii hand en
countered something, My fist clenched
tighter.

And I let the mule loose.

After I located the light switch, 1 ex-
amined the paper towel dispenser to see ii
1 had done any damage, I shuffled out the
door, head hanging sheepishly. My right
hand was throbbing. On the way out, I
passed some guy going in. The door swung
shut as I walked away I'd taken about
twenty steps when I decided to turn back. i
opened the bathroom door slowly. bent
down. and saw tennis shoes in the first
stall

I stood erect once again. turned on the
light. and pulled the door shut behind me
