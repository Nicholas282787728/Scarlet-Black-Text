ful and profitable summer. In your respective communities,
YOU are the personiﬁcation of Grinnell—wits spirit, its traditions,
its loyalties, and its ideals. Your responsibilities are therefore

great.

Among your companions and associates are many young people
who could wisely benefit by the many opportunities offered by
Grinnell College.

In carrying out your responsibilities as a Grinnellian, you can do

much for the school, as well as for individuals, by encouraging

‘To Studentsﬁand 1941 ‘
Graduates of \

eager young people to learn more about the Crinnell plan of a
liberal education, the democratic spirit of your educational insti-
tution, and the profitable intellectual environment of your college.
Keep in touch with your college this summer by dropping air a

card, telling us about future Grinnellians.
