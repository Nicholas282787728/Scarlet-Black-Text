Horn urges students to put
aside political differences

A Personal Opinion By
Howard B. Horn

ICE-PRESIDENT AI

R / Gore recently appeared

on The Late Show With

Davtd Letterman. Letterman. in

hisusualeomiealapproach,asked

Gore about former Vice-Presir

tlent Dan Quayle. Gore replied.

“He’s a nice guy. Awful jump
shot, but a nice guy."

In the 1980’s when both
Quayle andGorewereinthe Sen-
ate. they played basketball to—
gether. A Democrat With strong
environmental convictions
played basketball with a tensor
vative Republican who released
a report saying environmental-
istn is bad for business. During
the 1992 Vice»Presidential dc-
bate, they didn't even have the
common decency to address each
other by more than each other’s
first names. -

The staffers for the Illinois
Congressional Delegation have a
softball league. Paul Simon, a
liberal Democrat who ran for
president in 1988. had his staff
face the statfofBobMichael,the
Republican House Minority
Leader.

You'd think Democrats and
Republicans are mortal enemies.
waiting to cut each other's throat
if given the opportunity. This is
not so. They're co-workers, and
they seem to get along.

In public. Republicans and
Democrats always seem to be
bickering at each other. They
never seem to agree on issues.
But that is the public forum; in
private,membersofCongress are
different. Some are married,
some have kids.somelike to hunt.
some like to cook. They're just
like regular people in tlicir prir
vate lives, and their interests of
ten seem to defy party lines.

This ties into Grinnell life.
