a man, seemed more like a public

rrom the hearr. It is a rypical Bruce
Wilson song as far as I can rell.

Through much of his ser, he
passionlessly sang, wirh his giiirar

times folk vrirrs They were songs

factor in his work.

A ten \‘ear nicmberofthc Bahri’i’
eommuniry, Mr. Wilson’s faith pare
vades eyery aspecr of his music. He
spoke ofhow he is "trying re undec
stand the true meaning of life and
using music as a tool" to accomplish
this goal. Quoting the prophet Mo—
hammad. Mr. Wilson said that
“knowledge is a single point but the
ignoranr have ninlriplied ir," Hesees
himselr as “a seryanr to humanity"
With the objective ofhelping people
re “reconnect iviih rheir rrue pur—
pose"andfindthatsinglepointagain

Finding the single point has def—
initely been the overriding central
rheme in Wilson’s lire. The years
from 196972 played an imporranr
role in the formation of Btuce \X/ilr
son's core values. A member of the
highschoolgrauduaringclassermz,
he grew up in a period orsoeial revo.
lution which taught him to “ques
tion everything." After experieno
ing college and a stint in the white
collar world, Mr, Wilson knew that
he had to become an nIUSL Thus. he
has spent the past 15 years “incubat—
ing"hisniiisicalralenrs,rliiriiig which
riine he has also experimented with
painting, pottery, and other artistic
endeavors. Finally. he decided that
music was the best way for him to
make a living.

However, money was dormiiely
nor rhe deciding factor in Wilson's
(lectslon re release his new, selepro
diieed album, Listen re the voice. A
narivr of Des Moines, he has done

much volunteer work in the past. He
gives music workshops for youth in
the Baha‘icommumty and continues
to perform concerts for free to those
who ask. Mr Wilson admits that he
does not wish to become rich nor
famous but only wants to “promote
peace and understanding" inthe world
while makinga modest livmgplaying
his songs. His musical career is sup«
porred mostly rhrough rhe sales orhis
