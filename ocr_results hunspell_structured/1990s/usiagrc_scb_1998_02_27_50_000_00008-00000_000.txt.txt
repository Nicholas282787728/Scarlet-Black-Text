“Heading into the meet we were

lected as the league‘s CorCoaeh of the
year, “We ﬁnished second and swam
better than expected. There were
some real surprises."

Nobody was surprised with the
output of sophomore Nathan Lueck.
who won the 50 freestyle in 21.98.
After clocking the best mark in the
prelims, 21.6, Lueck had what coach
Hurley described as a “terrible start"
and a “bad turn" in the title race,
Despite this, the sprinter was able to
kick it up a gear and come from be-
hind to defeat the defending confer-

ence champion from Lake Forest.

“Nathan really showed his come
petitive drive. He could have suc~
cumbcd to his mistakes, but instead
he dug in and won the race." ex—
plained Hurley.

dove before he arrived at Grinnell,"
noted Hurley.

Rookie Justin Hoest produced
great results with two Secondrplace
ﬁnishes. His time of55.36 in the 100
backstroke broke a 16-year—old

The Grinnell College Women’s
basketball team wrapped up it's bit-
tersweet (547 overall, 1-12 confer-
ence) season With two more disap—
pointing losses last week. However.
the Pioneers remained positive and
expressed satisfaction that both star
tisticai and personal improvements
had been made throughout the sea
son. The hoopsters fell to Knox. 57,

were overpowered by Lawrence, 84.

Against Knox the cagers played
well for the most part. The game
plan was carried out accurately and
the Pioneers performed well in the
second half, outscoring the Prairie
Fire. 33-29, However, Knox’s shoots
ing guard proved too hot l0 handle,
lighting up the scoreboard wnh seven
of eight shooting from three-point
land.

and carried her team to victory."
commented Coach Jenny Wood.
“We adjusted defensively and made
up significant ground in the second
half, but just could not overcome
their pinpoint shooting. This was
frustrating for us all because it was
the seventh game this season that we
lost by six points or fewer."

Amy Walters ‘01 led in scoring
With 19 points, Liz Graf ‘01 buck-
etcd 13, and seniorSally Goodspeed

managed 10 in her final home game.
Sacha Steenhoek ‘00 grabbed seven
rebounds.

”Versus Lawrence weJust played
ﬂat." remarked Wood. “The Whole
team appeared emotionally tired and
it was tough for us to break through."

Lawrence took advantage of the
drained Pioneer squad by coming out
strong and hitting over 50% of its
shots the entire game. At halftime
the Vikings led by 21 and their hot
shooting carried over into the second
period to snuff out any hope of a
Grinnell comeback.

Graf led in the scoring department
with 12 while Walters hit for 11.
Meghan Pheister ‘00 pulled down
seven boards.

“Overall. I think that despite our

. losing record we managed to accom'-

pllsh a number of goals this season,"
Wood stated. “The players improved
vastly on their weaknesses, and star
tisiically we bettered our scoring av
erage and win percentage from the
previous season.

“Unfortunately. we lost Mandi
Hill to injury and she was key in our
offensive strategy. However, other
players such as Goodspeed stepped
up and led by example by giving
herselfto the team. Ihope iliis resilr
ieni attitude will continue to be
implemented by all the returning
players. I look forward to closing
the win/loss gap next season," she
concluded.
