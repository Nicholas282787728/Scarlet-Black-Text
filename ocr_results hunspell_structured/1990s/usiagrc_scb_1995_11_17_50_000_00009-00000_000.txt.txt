Students GivenToo Little Say?
To the Editor:

I would hire to respond to your
commentaryofNovemberBth. “Stu—
dents arc given too little say in im—
porrant decisions ,,

it seems to me that you have
very little concepr of how or why a
bureaucracy works The prolessor
you quoted was not only implying
that “we all contribute to what the
college is," he was directly stating
that the college is ”a loosely orga»
nized collection orstutlents, protes.
sors, and administrators." Thismeans
there is no central power, No one
has the power to change anything
important without going through the
sorcalled proper channels That’s
not an accident.

Grinnell College is the reposl/
tory for a tremendous amount of

money, belonging to several thou-
sand people. If that money is mis-
managed, it will be withdrawn—not
only will the alumni stop donating.
but students will leave the school,
This is why the current system of
committees and trustees is in place:
to give the college a stable base of
educated people making informed
decisions. The students are not as
well educated as those who run the
college and usually not as informed
about the way the bureaucracy works,
and they are only here for four years.

You are no exception, and you
prove itwith everyedirorialyou write,
You demonstrate your lack ofeduca—
tion by referring to student initia»
tives as “referendums” (while “refer—
endums" is an acceptable plural. ref—
erenda are very different in function
from initiatives), you show your igr
norance of proper channels by ridi.
culing the Harris faCllitles and par.
ties in the newspaper rather than
speaking directly to the Harris staff
or holding a party of your own, and
you pmVlde us with an archetype of
immature instability when you sug.
gest that ne got drunk and destroy
the Harris Center with sledgeham—
mers Perhaps the “In the Coffee"
column was supposed to be humor—
ous, supposed to be considcrcd sepa.
rately from the ﬂtljou‘llng article, but
ilii isequallylnc‘llcaln'eOfyouropnr
ions, it frightens me

lam not accusing you oflncotn—
perence. I am accusing you of hate
headedness and lack orrorethought,
two faults which i am adeprat recog-
nizing because I have them myself it
gives me a certain feeling ofsecurlty
to know that the college bureaucracy
will never give eitherorus the power
which you crave and which neither
ofus deserves.

Is Grinnell Friendlyl
Dear Editor:

As you ltnoiy, when I arrived in
Grinnell last year I had some fortu»
itous experiences, My lirst year in
Grinnell was enjoyable: I met many
people and went to several commu«
nity activities But now I guess the
“honeymoon" is over. Partly this is
because my goals have now changed
from my first year. Before. I just
wanted to get to know the communi—
ty and its different aspects. Now i
want to become a part ofthe commu—
nity, make friends and get married
and start a family. lam finding that
to be very difficult and disappoint—
ing.

iprobahiy would not have writ.
ten this letter because I am not al«
ways sociable and I am not the great.
est conversationalist nor particularly
witty. lam somewhat shy and pecu<
liar (not liking or having a car being
one of the biggest peculiarities).
However, there has been anaccumu—
lationofvarious unfriendly incidenc»
es. Plus I have had contact with
other newcomers to Grinnell who
say the people are unfriendly. Also,

various “old—timers" (i.e. born here)
have told me that Grinnell is “supcp
ficially friendly.” People will smile
and say ”Hi" and invite you to their
church. but beyond that Will not try
to make you a part oftheir lives

one incident especially made
me wonder, Iwent intoadowntown
store, placed my item on the counter
and then paused, trying to remember
which pocket I put my change in.
The clerk was watching me and, when
I began unzipping my jacket. she
froze. Because she looked nervous I
told her. “I‘m just getting change"
and then got some out. Then, be—
cause ofher look. I asked her point
blank, “You thought I was going to
shoot you?" Her response- “Quite
frankly.yes. Younevercanteiithese
days."

When told of this incident, a
person explained to me that people
in Grinnell are more concerned these
days because of the murders of the
college student two years ago and of
the child last year. Nevertheless,
these and other incidents have made
me reel that I am not a part of this
community—that I do not belong
here

i am tempted to introduce my
self by saying, “Hello, I‘m Crosby
The outsider ,,

This letter has two purposes.
One was to tell you that I think that
Grinneli may have a problem. My
second purpose is to offer sugges—
tions. ihatecoinplaiuersand believe
in complaining only if [ can offer
help, so the following are some ways
[believe that Orinitell can become a
friendlier city and maybe even give
itselfthetitle:“Grinnell'TheFtiendr
ly City."

Either the city or Chamber can
begin a “Newcomers Club." Yes. we
have a “Welcome Wagon" and l was
Visited by that person, But all I got
fromthatwasafriendlyconversation
of is minutes and a few coupons.
The “Newcomers Club" would be
more extensive. First, it would be
advertised around town and in the
paper every so often so that people
knew ofits existence Then, when a
newcomerioinedthecluboraneigh—
bot notified the club of a newcomer,
that person would then be listed and
the followmg could possibly happen
(or more):

A A listing inthe paper, “Con—
gratulations to the following people
for becoming residents in Grinnell,”
along with an encouragement to res»
idents to be friendly to these people.

B. The wcicome wagon would
be noticed. The Welcome Wagon
person told me that she did not al—
ways know when there were new
residents.

C Designated “oldtimers” would
pick a newcomer and inVite the new—
comer to specific events, accompa-
nying the person to the event and
showing the person around town and
introducing the person to various
people.

Z. You, if you learn of newcom—
er, could make it a point to invite and
accompany the person to an activity.
(It is not enough to merely inVite the
persontosorne community activity)
I would not advise inviting the per—

Commentary - 9

son to your home because. it is true,
the person is a stranger and could be
a danger.

3 Perhaps some affluent person
could open a night “Coffee Shop" in
downtown. People need a public
place tosocialize and yet do not want
to go to a bar or restaurant. I have
been told by several people that such
a place would not do very well which
is why I suggested that an afﬂuent
person might want to open it so that
such a person would not be so cone
cerned about making a profit. How»
ever, I think that, after a slow begln<
mng, such a place would become
quite popular and would be a great
place for college and town people to
meet in a friendly atmosphere. It
would be a further inducement ifthe
place had performers, singers, and
acoustic bands (so that people could
talle easily and not be drowned out by
the noise).

4 The college students could
put on an acrwity specifically de-
signed for town people to arrend and
enioy the amenities and friendliness
of the college.

5. College students could start
specificallyllwitingatownperson to
an activity at the college (\.E. at the
Harris Center) and accompanying
and getting to know the person
seems to me that college students
are as much respomible for making
the town seem unfriendly by simply
not associating with town people

6, Have a block or street party.
One person told me that the people
on her street seemed unfriendly and
did not seem to know each other.
The city should allow and encourage
such actiVities by approving them
speedily, providing barricades and
whatever other help is needed.

well, those areyust a fewsugges-
tions which could make Grinnell a
much more friendly place to live in.
I am sure you have your own, Make
your ideas known and begin imple«
menting them.

Sincerely.

Sexual Assault Awareness

To the campus community:

According to the Office ofStu»
dent Affairs. the number of reported
incidents of sexual assault on the
GrinneiiOoliegecampusrisessignil.
icantly after Waltz.

we, as a campus, must become
more conscious of the implications
of our sexual relations and interac—
lions, specilically, we need to un—
derstand how to prevent sexual as.
sauitandharassment,andwhartodo
lfsucl’l a situation occurs.

At Waltz. where many people
are both drunk and looking for a
person to go home with, awareness of
your environment, your boundaries,
and your judgement is especially lm<
pottant Sex itself is not the prob—
limitntlﬁer, it is sex without con-
versation, mutual respect and/or con—
sent (or without a condom or a den«
tal dam).

All forms of sexual abuse ate
crimes, from unwanted touching to
rape, Iowa law states that having sex
with someone who is incapable of
giving consent is rape. Being incapa—
ble of giving consent can mean being
drunk. being high, or being scared,
Silence is not consent.

Ifa situation occurs where your
trust is violated, it is not your fault.
You can, if you want, call a sexual
assault student advocate (at DVA/
SAC) at LEGO—7793512. Go to the
Office ofStudent Affairs in the base
ment of the Forum and speak with
Jen Krohn, Jo Calhoun orTom Cmcly
to tlemde what action to take.
