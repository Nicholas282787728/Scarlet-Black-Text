wants to take Sesame Street off the

According to Newtie, Sesame

I remember one day when I was
sitting in preschool and all ofa Sud»
den Irealized that Iknew my ABC' 5.
I knew it had nothing to do with my
daycare teacher (all she taught me
was how to play Simon Says). She
had a roomful ofscrenming kids and
basically itwasplaytimealldaylong.
We had no real time forquality edur
cational stuff, Where else could I
have learned the alphabet? Theonly
thtngmy motherallowed meto watch
was Sesame Street and other PBS
children's programming, It had to
be Sesame Street! I owe Oscar the
Grouch and Grover my life. They
made me what I am today! Sesame
Street should be left on the air for its
educational beneﬁts alonc. Ittcaches

little kids the alphabel, how to Count
and even how to read, as well as

many other useful things.

It is also one of the few
childien's programs that does not

along together, They are exposed to
different cultures and learn that eve
eryone is equal, I even learned a
couple of Spanish words when I
watched it! What a great concept
this is When you look at other
cartoons you have the Asians that
cannot “Speaka no English” and the
strectwisc hiphoppin' black and
Latino kids who know how to rap
and dance. Semitic Streetpromotes
togetherness. How can something
be so bad that does that?

So Sesame Street is very politic

cally correct. But I think this is a
good thing. If political correctness

is taught atsuch a young age, maybe
people would actually believe in it
instend OfJLISl pretending they do, lt
is a good thing to teach young Clttls

and he told me about a little skit they
had done on Sesame Street. A little
kid was brushing his teeth buthe had
the water running while he was
brushing. All ofa sudden he hears a
knock on the window. He turns
around and discovers it is 2i little
fishic, The fishie begs the kid to turn
off the water while brushing, The
little kid then goes over to the wins
dew and sees the fishie in a lake With
the water level going down rapidly,
The little boy turns off the water but
later is sad to discover that the lake
the little ﬁsltie wzis swimming in is
now only a pond,

Is this not a great tdezi? Who
wouldn't thinkteaching children not
to waste water is admirable? III had
actually seen this on Sesame Street
when I was younger. maybe I would
be more careful with the amount of
water I use now. But since I didn’t
see this, I use bucket after bucket

The point I'm trying to make here is
who can live without Sesame Street? I

Multicultural education should

be everyone’s responsibility

By CHRIS PALLAS
Sports Editor
AST weekl discussed multicuiluiialism, particularly the problems it causes
Lhete at Grinnell. As a result of the fwdbackl received, I believe that those
problems are worse than ever. However, I've already made my complaints.
This week‘s piece is dedicaued to solutions.

The first pan ofsolving the problem is making sure that everyone understands
exactlywtiatniulticulturalisinis. Anumberofpeoplen'lvolvedinthemulticultumlism
movement informed me thatI misdeflnod multicultumlism last week. Some even
went so faras tosay thatIshould lookup adeﬁnition inthelibiary. Thesepeoplecomd
notbemote wrong. Multicultiaalism may existonpziper,butitalso existsin theheans
and minds of the students here athnnell; it is notan abstraetphilosophy, but instead
a visable reality oflife on this campus, When students here form an opinion about
mulljculturaljsm, they don‘t run to Burling. Theyjust take a good look around.

The proponets of multiculturalism must realize mat if it is to succeed. diey mitst
deal with the ideas that students hold. Individuals act upon and criticize the thoughts
in melt heads, not the ones in their backpacks. Thus. my ﬁrst Solution is to redeﬁne
multiculturalism into something I feel can work and which students can agree with.

My multiculuiiallsm isthe notion thatifyouexposepoopleto olltercultmes,you
can lead them to question their u-adiuonal ——
standards of judgment and thus bemore - ' -

lures. My multiculturalism only assumes EDITORIAL

standards, not necessarily to make them
loiowledgableaboutanyorallothergroups.

So if multiculturalism can be 100st
deﬁned as alittle educau'on, who nwds to —
be educated? A key part of solving the mulucultuiahsm problem at Grinnell is to
achiowledge that no group is excluded born the need to be educated. I was

particularly ﬁustmted in my discussions wiihmy endcs when they assumed thatthey
did not share the responsibility to teach and to learn,

Being a minority in a white society and leaming Euroeeniric history in school
doesn’t automatically make one open-minded The key reason is that white society
is exuemelydlvelse; whiiepeople hndbelnggenemlizedinto agroup just asinsuldng
as minoritiesdo, American history hardly teaches the history ofall whitepeople. The
earliest oflny ancestors didn't arrive in America until 1916 and I learned about as
much about my ancestry in school as I teamed about Cambodia Funhennote,
learning a little about a small segment ofAmerican society does not generally make
one more open minded because people ale so quick to assume Eurooentnc history is
warped that they dismiss it widiout ever opening their minds to some ofthe truths it
contams.

beyond this, it one truly wants to end mcism, they cannot use extraneous
circumsmncestoabsolve him ofliisobljgauon tolcam, Some indiVidualsIuilkedwith
suggested thnttheir mce had already done its part to combat racism, presumably by
being oppressed and tlisciiminatod against That's illogical, Being oppressed does
notmakeone lesstactst. lfanything, itmakcshim moreinclinedto hatedieoppressing
group. And Just because your ancestors marched on Washington to ﬁght forequal
rights doesn’t mean you are open minded, ltjust means your grandparents were.

Butwhile no gioup isenn‘iely widioutilte needto be educated, notall individuals
share that need lt is important to remember that no one is born racist. and that not
everyone is warped by theireducaljon. Ifindiwduzils learn to questionwhat they hear
from teachers, reporters and trends. they may eliminate any cultuial bias within
themselves. We can't generalize Ihat all people ofa oenain color must be educated,
Doing so only enhances racial tensioli. because it leads to the assumption that all
members of that gioup are racist until they learn enough to end biased thought

Once we establish who needs to be educated. the only remaining question is
“How?” Since we have established that all groups share the need to be educated, it
follows then that all groups share the responsibility to help educate each other This
education can only be achieved through intemetion. I was a bit distrurbod when
seveial minority members infomied me that I had an obligaLion Io educaie myself on
my own because “the books are in the library." Obviously Ican't watch a few Spike
Lee movies and read acopyofMalcolmXandcall myselfnon-tacisL Racism is about
an inability to accept people. Accepting people in a society and facts in a book are
