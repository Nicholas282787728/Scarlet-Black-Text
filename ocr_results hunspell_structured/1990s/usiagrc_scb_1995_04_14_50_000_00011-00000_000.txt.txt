said Coach Eben Erhard.

The Grinnell track season ofﬁa
cially began last weekend at Luther,

Becca Webel and sophomore Sarah
Boudouris broke the school record

ceeding her former personal best by 10'.
“If she keeps this up, she be-
comes a strong possibility to score
points at the Midwest Conference
meet later this spring," Erhard said.
“Grinncll‘s focus this Lime of year
would be on speed, but [the weather]
mightcall formsl and recuperation. The
rest will do us well, perhaps forcing our
best meet," Erhard said.
