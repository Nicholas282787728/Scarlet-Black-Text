Burling security concerns expressed

By Paul Midler

____——

Growing concern over the lack of
adequate security at Burling Library
has prompted library staff to take
action. A four-page letter addressing
the issue was drafted and signed in
July by 18 library staff members and
sent to administrators.

One of the immediatesecurity con-
cerns is the precarious position that
Circulation Desk Supervisors are
placed in at closing. The Desk Super,
visor is solely responsible for making
sure that no one remains in the build-
ing after closing which occurs on
mostnightsatl:003m.sherry Shults,
a desk supervisor, said “Of the four-
teen Desk Supervisors I have worked
with in the last ten years, there hasn’t
been one who hasn't expressed con-

 

 

 

 

cern for his or her own safety when
clearing the building,"

Students who occassionally hide
in the library at night for fun have
been the source of much of the anxir
eLy. “Hpeopleare managing to stay at
night to play games,” says Desk Su-
pervisor Sarah Hamilton. “they can
find ways to stay behind for mali-
cious reasons, too. That is frightenr
mg.”

Some small attempts to improve
security have been made, but, in the
opinion of concerned staff members,
improvementshavebeenslowincom-
ing, and inadequate In trying to allay
the anxiety of Desk Supervisors, an
additional student has periodically
been added to the closing shift,allow-
ing the Desk Supervisor to be accom-
panied on her sweep of the building.

Yet, this has not relieved the uneasi-
ness of some late-night workers.
Burling Library is the only aca-
demic building on campus where
those who work in the building are
expected to actas security personnel.
The college is also in the process
of equipping late-night employees
with two-way radios, but the mod
sure, which will only link the Desk
Supervisorwithastudentatthecircur
lation desk, is seen as ineffective.
Burling Library staff, in their as-
sertion of needed security improve-
ments, propose that the library be
closed by trained, professional secua
rity personnel who could then also
make periodic and complete rounds
ofthe library at nightand early mom-
mg.
Mr. Engel asserts that, “so far we
have been very lucky that nothing
serious has occurred." President

“when itcomes to human safety there

Lehman discusses de Man, 1

By Ted Schenkelberg

Amidst some controversy, author
and poet Davtd Lehman spoke in
South Lounge lastTucsday abouthis
latest book, “Sign of the Times:
Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul
de Man." He also gave an informal
poetry reading.

Lehman is currently touring the
country speaking about his book,
which has caused quite a stir in the
academic world.

His book, which would seem to
have a limited audience, has been
reviewedinnearlycverymajornews-
paper throughout the country and is
the subject of much discussion in
many literary publications.

words, ideas cannot exist. Derrida '
further stated that between ideas and t
words there is a great abyss; there is ‘
no constant or understood definition
in words. Everything can then be rc- '
duced down to a rhetoric which is .
indefmable and contradicting.

Deconstructionmadeitswayfrom ‘
Europe to America via the brilliant 7
academic and literary philosopher
Paul de Man. De Man landed apost— ‘
tion at Yale in the early 1970’s, and 4
applied deconstruction theory to litr‘
erary analysis.

The result of Deconstructionism “
was an interpretation of literature a
which rendered the author dead, and
what critics saw as the defilement of '
classic texts. .

While reporting for Newsweek in ,
1987,fouryearsafterdeMan’sdcath,
Lehman uncovered a scandal which ‘
shook the literary and intellectual t
world. A former student of de Man
discovered that while de Man was in ‘
Belgium at the outbreak of World -
WarII.he had contributed to over l70 ,
newspapers collaborating with the
Nazis. ‘

Though many of these articleswere a
literary, some suggested the outright
deportation of the Jews. Lehman’s ’
further research led him to believe .
that de Man was also a bigamist and
financial fraud. '

Lehman maintained that if the~

, theory was to make the author :1de

and reduce everything to rhetoric or
contradiction, it would in effect nul- v
lil’y or justify anything that de Man,
had done. It was, in short, a theory
void of any moral standard and thus ‘
appealed to de Man on some level. _
Later in the evening Lehman enr

and faculty with his poetry. 0n Sevr .

When criticism of
deconstructionism is seen in the con- '
text of his poetry, there is little doubt .
why Lehman attacks a literary theory ~
which renders theauthor dead. Over»
