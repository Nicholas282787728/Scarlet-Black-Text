ago, 11 million people \Vclc mur-
dered simply for being who they
were. But I wtll not be silent today.
On Wednesday, May 7th, 1 returned
home aftcr‘class to find a swasttka,
the hateful Nazi symbol, drawn on
my dry erase board. I was shocked.
scared, and saddened. I have the
freedom to be who I am at Grinllcll.
Ido not have to hide my identity; I
express it proudly and publically: I
am a Jew. I am Bisexual, I am a
woman, Never would I have ex-
pected such an ugly sign of hate to
come from a member of tho Grinnell
College Community which claims to
support one another. Such suffering
affects EVERYONE, and it is horrl~
bly tragic that members of the
Grinnell College Community would
use it against one another. The Ho~
locaust affects everyone. not only
Jews and Queers. The swastika is a
symbol that should make every Hu-
man Being shudder. I erased the it,
but its presence will make me look
over my shoulder an extra time as I
walk around campus. It is not just
antirScmitism. it is not just Ho-
mophobia. It is hate.

Ido not know who you are. I do
not want to know who you are I am
Shocked, I am scared, and I am sad-
dened. ButhillNOT be Silent. Out
of honor and respect for the 11 mil-
lion people wllo perished because the
world said nothing I will not be sl-
lent. Ifthat which does not break 115
makes us stronger, then I hope the
strength of the Grinncll College
Community will stand with me.in
remembering those who died and in
remembering where hate symbols
such as swastikas can lead.

The Next Martin
Luther King, Jr.?

Dear Editor,

The following letter is a response]
received after voicing my opinion
about a recent SDAE protest against
the use of primates for AIDS re-
Search.

“Rachel(sic),

“I am sorry that you feel that way. I
would like to tell you about some
one named Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. perhaps you've heard about him
before?

Whether or not people like to ad-
mit it, he changed the world for the
better by using means of Civil
Disobidience (which is exactly what
Josh and I did). The civil rights
movement needed all the arrests that
were made, it needed to Show that
the people who were ﬁghting for
what they belived in were willing to
put themselves on the line for it. No
body pays attention to the silent, no-
body pays attention to the letters, or
the people holding a sign, because
they are not a threat to anyone, and
they chalenge nothing. The Animal
Abuse Industry is a multi-blllion
dollar industry, and we are not go—
ing to be able to bring it down by
asking quietly or politely. They need
to see the mass media exposoing
them! The torture and the stiffening
going on behlnd those walls can only
continue as long as no one finds out
about it, The media this past week»
end was 100 times more interested
in our story because of the arrests,
and there was coverage constmtly on
every news station including CNN
The whole world is watching them
know, and they know it! That‘s the
power that we as THE PEOPLE

hold! I‘m am sorry to hear that
you’ve already lost your understand-
ing of how much power you actu-
ally have. THIS PAST WEEKEND
WENT DOWN IN HISTORY!
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF
THE END FOR THE ANIMAL
ABUSE INDUSTRY, AND IT’S
ONLY GOING TO BE DE-
STROYED THIS WAY. Trust me,
I've tried it all, this is by FAR the
most powerful. Perhaps what you
truly fear is that WHEN we succeed
your own personal life will be altered
forever. and you will no longer be
able to optess billions of beings ev-
ery single day. TELLTHAT DAY OF
TOTAL ANIMAL/HUMAN LIBA
ERATION“. I'm yours inw

PEACE AND JUSTICE

ONE STRUGGLE, ON'E FIGHT

Personally, I don’t think that her pro—
test for the apes in Atlanta parallels
MLK Jr.’s liferlong crusade for hu«
man rights. But maybe that's just me.

Food ﬁght at Quad: RSVP

Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter be»,

cause I am very angry and in need of
an outlet. Tuesday night at about
5:30pm there was a food ﬁght in
Quad and my friends and I were
caught in the middle of it. I“ knew
who all the participants were I would
not write this letter; instead, I would
personally let them know whatI was
thinking. This is an open letter to
anyone and everyone who threw
food. Look, the end of the semester
is a tough time, I’ve got work to get
done and all the worries that come
with graduation and the last thing I
need is to suddenly ﬁnd myself in
the middle of a storm of ﬂying food

and utensils. This is my last year here
and I‘ve seen a lot of lhings, I expect
Grinnell students to behave
strangely, especially this time of year.
Everyone needs to blow off steam.
What I am not used to, and what I
object to is the complete disregard
for others. There is no way anyone
needs to have a food ﬁght. you had
plenty of ways to release stress and
have fun that did not involve throw-
ing forks and ice cream at my friends
and I. At the end of the ﬁght one of
you morons actually asked a friend
of mine “didn’t you
know about it?"
Look idiots, if you
do not tell us about
it, how are we sup-
posed to know?
What form of com-
munication did you
think you were us-
ing? Maybe you've
begun to talk to each
other using some
sort of high pitched
whistling that isn‘t
audible to our hu-
man ears. Are you
assuming that I
would have just
heard through the
grapevine that
you’ve been plan-
ning a food fight?
Do you think that
we‘re actually so
concerned with your
world? Obviously,
you must think that
people are ever so
interested in your
life and watch your
every move. Get over YOURSELF!
I don‘t move in your ape-like social
circle. People at my high school
were more mature than you. Some-
times I get so caught up in thinking
that Grinnell is a prestigious educa-
tional institution that I forget about t
some of the specimens we have here.
I rejoice to see that there are still
qualities of human character that are
not measurable using standardized
tests and high school grades. Did
you actually imagine that we did

OP ON

know there was going to be a food
ﬁght and were simply consenting to
be pelted with food and silverware?
Perhaps you thought we were hop-
ing to get glops of mush and ice
cream on our clothes? People actu-
ally had to wash food out of their
hair! This sounds silly, but a thrown
potato could actually hurt someone.
Should students have to take time
between dinner and going to the li-
brary to clean food off themselves?
We do not need extra stress right
now. A few weeks ago, I was an-

5

Quad. Dining hall workers are stur
dents, and when they stay late at
work to clean up after others it means
they have less time to get all their
end of the semester work done. Part
of becoming the adults that you all
are in theory is realizing that the ac
tionS you take have consequences.
Messes do not get magically cleaned
up, how old are you? Are people on
ﬁnancial aid supposed to take care
of your problems? You don’t know
how much I wish swearing were ap-
propriate in a letter to the editor. Din-

“Martyrfor Quad"

gered by a column in this paper that
suggested Grinnel] students had
proven themselves incapabie of re-
sponsible self-govemance, but this
outbreak of simian behavior is bring-
in g me over to that point of View. At
the end of the ﬁght the participants
actually got up from their tables and
made as if to leave the dining hall.
They were stopped at the door of
course, but apparently they thought
that cleaning up after a food ﬁght was

the responsibility of the workers at ,
