OP 10

Ask Iggy!‘

Hi there, How many days left until
spring break? The answer is: too
many. This week’s guest advice
comes from Anna’s Morn, Anna ape
patently went to her Mom asking for
advice about breaking up with some
one. I-Ier mom said: “You shouldn't
break up because at least you have a
boyfriend." Keep in mind that I
would never give advice that. . . pain-
fully poignant? Send me questions
and advice by Tuesday to box 10—14
or e—mail [ASKIGGY]. Don’t be
shy.

Look! Letters.

hi igsy,

i came to a striking realization this
week and want to know your fee]-
ings about it. I realized that i have
no life. but i am ok with this because
i live my life through other people
and their gossip. i am just so busy
ﬁguring out everyone else's prob
lems, i don't need my own life! is
this problematic, or have i discovered
the key to happiness?

sincerely.

Blissful,

You have found the key to happiness.
Shhh. Don't tell everyone or then
we’ll all be happy and no one will

have any gossip to spread.

my roommate believes himself to be
the ruler of the free world. Every
now and again, he tapes penny's to
the ceiling or attempts to communir
Cate with the squirrels. Once, i tried
to talk with him about it but he re-
fused to listen and then accused me
ofharboring Satan in my underwear
drawer. What should I do:’

hi. i have a question. how does
one keep up energy and enthusiasm
throughout the semester 7 or even
half the semester?

Totally-
No one keeps up energy and enthUr

Those people who appear to be en-

Dear Iggy.

I feel lost. I don’t know whoI
am anymore? This is complicated
because I am trying to ﬁnd out what
I want in life. Is this a normal col-
lege feeling. Do others feel this way
about their first year at Grinnell?
Please help.

-Lost in confusion.

Dear lost.
Yes.

Dear Iggy.

I’m very into the whole Star Wars
thing. I have the movies on tape, I
have several Star Wars posters, I have
Star Wars toys... I’ve even been to
Des Moines to see the ﬁrst two mov-
ies of the trilogy. I generally don’t
like to buy into whatever happens to
be the current rage in popular cul-
ture, but I can’t seem to help myself
when it comes to Star Wars. I feel
like I have no control, that when I
see a new Star Wars toy I just HAVE
to buy it. Han is just so sexy, Leia
just kicks ass... and how can we for
get those wonderful EwokslllllH
How can I reconcile my near obseSr
siori with these wonderful movies
with the fact that everyone and his/
herAunt Betty are also obsessed with
them? I‘mjust so used to abhorring
things that are “all the rage."

Sign me,
Distraught in Dagobah

Hey Dagobah,

It‘s not an obsession because Leia
does, in fact, kick ass. If you’re still
having aproblem with this then why
not start up a support group'.7 I'm
sure there are gobs of folks around
who would join if you can pry them

out of their Darth Vader masks.

OPINIQN
—Both States:

This week with Dave Rudel

Bcn Patrick’s column two weeks ago regarding physi»
cian assisted suicide can be easily summarized in two

points
1) Phystcian-assisied suicide should
be made legal when the patient is in
great pain or possesses arerininal po-
Sition.
2) The institution ofPAS would not
increase the number orpcoplc seekr
ing suicide,

1 agree with Ben’s overall
stance, but disagree with him on lltt:
details,

First ofall, the institution of PAS will increase the numr
ber of people seeking suicide. Children are currently
having the negative vision ot‘suieidc thrust upon them
When I was ti child, suicide was never presented in a
pemnsotblc light. However, if we portray suicide as

simply another soivice (whether- it is only render
those in certain suites), we put in on the same level as
prescription drugs
SUlCidC innrc peim’ siblc. and this will Willy-nilly cause

ed to

flu: passing of PAS tacitly renders

more people lU (Icsrrc it,

Also. tllcrc is no reason why we should give the
option of stircidc only to those that are "terminally ill," or
"III great prim." as though we should have the right to

decide when someone else has the right to die. Besides

I agree with Ben ’3'

overall stance but

disagree with him
on the details.

the prticrictil problems ol detcrnrrning if someone is in
grunt cnoiigli pain (can you imagine being told that you

are not hurting enough to diet), there
is the theoretical error of ascribing
to one person a right forbidden to Mr
other based on the amount of pain _
ho is in. This is as wrong as telling
litlullS that they cannot by beer be-
cause they are not old enough. lcan
sec denying people certain rights due
to their not being adults, but not be
cause they are not in enough pain.

One last thing, l continue to harp on this right

to die. I would like to take this opportunity to distinguish
that fiom the right to have the government pay a physr-
cran it) clitl youl tire for you, t have no problem with
giving people the right to die, but their choosrng to should
not affect the amount ottax I must pay

 

lems in my life. First, lets start with
the invasion of my peaceful home
this weekend by freaks dressed in
polyester wielding cukes, gold rnc-
dallions, and liquor. Next, I am sup-
posed to be deciding on my future
plans, but my mind is so swamped
with Visions ofPolypodiaccac, com-
parative advantage, alid fossil fuel
guzzling tractors that l have little
time to myselfro meditate. And, ﬁ-
nally, my body is waging a war on
itself: infections of all sorts, an amalr
gain ofsores, almost loss ofeyesiglit
in one eye, hair loss creating a bald
spot, dry winter skin, and a desire to
sleep wherever I have to remain
seated for longer than 15 minutes. I
need lots of advice Iggy!

Signed.

No Longer Human

Hey human,
Well, you do have tons of problems.
I recommend going to Disco and
dancing your troubles away. Or
some quality time at the health ccne
ter. (Free condoms and dental dams
7 how could you go wrong?)
Maybe both Disco and the health

center would be a good idea.

Dear Iggy.

I have been visiting the dining halls
for almost four years now and trim
an avid tea drinker, Last year, I my,
ticcd that the specialty teas all glee
rify colonialism with their allusions
to Sir Thomas Lipton. As a rcsult,l
ended up taking a scmcstcr off in
order to work out how to den! with
that guilt. Although my conscience
now allows me to have tea without
feeling that I accept or condone ini-
perialistic policies, there is SIlll one
baming question: Who the hcll is
Earl Grey???

sincerely,
Exiled in Michigan

Exiled.
Who the he“ cares? No wnit, I
thought you were asking something
else.
Dear Disgusted and Htirried.
lthiilk installing Flowbies in all tlic
mcn’s bathrooms would be a great
idea. Why don’t you get SGA to
look into that.

Have a nice day,

More Than a Hippie
Dear Editor, .

It was a treat [0 read the article in
lastFriday's S&B on “dining in Grin-
nell." Overlooking things like the
confusion of “borne” for “born,“ I
would say it represented a level of
writing the newspaper can be proud
of: frisky and literate, a pleasure for
the reader and (I should imagine)
great fun for the writers.

While I have your attention, I’d like
to say (concerning another article in

last week's 5&3, the one about fic-
tion writer Terry Bisson‘s visit to
campus) that I‘m sorry to have given
your reporter the idea that the only
thing I have to say about Bisson is
that he was “Grinnell’s first hippie."
Anyone who reads Terry’s wonderr
ful stories in Bears Discover Fire
will know what I mean about the
pleasure to be found in good writ-
ing of almost any sort.

Sincerely.

It is here! You need not wait any
longer. Like the swallows returning
to Capistrano, so will Grinnell

waiting for in mouth-foaming
anticipation. DISCO, baby! For the

see our classmates clad in the
fashions of the 705, bathed in Brut,
and strutting their stuff, though
repugnant to some, for us it is a
divine revelation of everything
beautiful in this world. Do NOT hold
back, do not tone down your crazy
style, let it all hang out, throw your
funk down, make your groove
smooth, and bring all your love,
Saturday night, March 8th, 10
