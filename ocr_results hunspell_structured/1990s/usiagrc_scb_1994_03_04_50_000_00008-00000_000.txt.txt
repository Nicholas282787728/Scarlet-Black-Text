Powerful conclusion

By Alexander Sever-ens
a rebuilding season ended earlier than hoped last week as the Grinnell

 

 

College women's basketball team (8714) missed the Midwest Con-
ference tournament by a mere game. The Pioneers needed to beat
both Comell and Monmouth on the road, but came up a littJe short, and Coe
represented tlte South Division instead. The Pioneers decisively handled
Cornell, 8566, but later that week Monmouth surprised the Pioneers. 69-48.
Against Cornell, the Grinnellians jumped outearly and set the tone. The
Pioneers played a very steady game and f orch Cornell to make adjustments
to their game. Coach Mani Kingsley praised the inside strength the team
showed. “Jodi Van Meter and Kari Hallet were on foe and Cornell could not
stop them.“ Kingsley also pointed out that guard Stephanie Walters did an
excellent job feeding the ball into the middle. Van Meter finished the game
with 26points as she shota sizzling 13 for 15 from the field. Hallett was hot
too, putting in 17 points. Wailers and Dacey Waldron kept the pressure on
Cornell from the outside as tltey each pumped in 10 points.

Against Monmouth, the Pioneers never got into their rhythm and as a
result saw the game slowly slip away. The Pioneers were hurt by the loss of
Hallet just six minutes into the game, when she damaged leg ligaments.
Grinnell was also plagued by a ninerminute scoring drought in the second
period, a half which saw the Pioneers hit just 27% from the floor.

Walters was the only player hitting against Monmouth. She popped in
21 points, including four three-point baskets. Kingsley commented that
although Van Meter was held to nine points, she played the game of her life.
“I hope we can carry that enthusiasm into next year.“
