Monty Python's Life of Brian

Life of Brian isa h'iedeand-true Monty Python classic. It follows the life of a man named Brian who,
as he is living in the Holy Land at the same Lime as Jesus, is repeatedly mistaken for the Messiah.
Jokes about miscellaneous Christian legends, the Romans, etc. abound throughout the movie in a
psuedo—histon'cal context, with typical Python zaniness. Monihy Python'rLi/‘e of Brian will be
shown on Friday at 8:30 in Nonh Lounge, and on Sunday at 3:30 in the Harris Cinema.

Allen and Midler mix shopping and
sobbing in comedy Scenes From a Mall .

By Brett Fechheimer

_—__—_

While strolling the walkways of
that icon of Southern California cul-
turei the shopping malli Nick and
Deborah Fifer (Woody Allen and
Bette Midler) come to realize that
their 16-yearrold marriage may be
falling apart.

Nick and Deborah are a success-
ful, high-powered, and arehctyptcally
upperrmiddle-class LA. couple. As
the con tral characters ofScL'ncs‘ From

a Mall, a comedy directed by Paul
Mazursky and released last Febru~
ary, they ﬁnd themselves fighting,
kissing, and insulting each other
while immersed in an ironic environr
mentof glossy,hypedrupChrisimas-
season consumerism.

Almost all of Scenes From a Mall
(whose title is a cute, postmodcmtst
takeoffontheclassrc70‘sfilmSzenes
From a Marriage) takes place inside
the Fifers‘ local mall. The two weep,
confess their marital stns, and even

threaten a mime as they ride the escar ‘
lators and frequent the stores and res-‘
taurants of this glitzy, palatial bul-A
wark of modem Americana.

Although many of its scenes seem ‘
disjointed, Mail is, by and large. 2A
very funny film, Allen's nwbishness’
and Midlcr’sbawdincss may scam an
odd combination, but their two per-*
sonalities actually do click;— in a.
quirky sort of way. Scene: From a,
Mail will be shown on Saturday at
7:30 ln Harris Cinema.
