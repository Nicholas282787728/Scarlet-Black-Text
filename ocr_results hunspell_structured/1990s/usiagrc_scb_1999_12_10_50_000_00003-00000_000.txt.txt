Staﬁ Wn'ter Mike
Andersen interviewed
several members of
the Chinese
Department in order
to learn about next
years new proposed
concentration, East
Asian Studies. As it
stands this year,
there is both a
Chinese language
major and Chinese
Studies
concentration. The
proposed change is to
expand the Chinese
Studies concentration
to East Asian Studies,
adding the Japanese
language.

How did this East Asian Language program
develop from the current Chinese program?

That was an initiative by the faculty. The group
that works with the interdisciplinary studies
concentration has a proposal to change the
Chinese Studies concentration to the East Asian
Studies concentration. That proposal will go
through the curriculum committee next semester.
The faculty realized that it would really help the
concentration and the curriculum in East Asian
studies it we had a second East Asian language
so they put a proposal in to Fund for Excellence
to start Japanese at Grinnell College. There’s
been a favorable response to that initiative: we
are advertising now for somebody to come next
year for a two-year appointment. The
advertisements are due approximately] in March.
We're moving ahead and bringing someone here

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Q

to teach Japanese, and the concentration
committee is working on expanding the
curriculum and concentration.

It would include some history?

It already includes some history. Professor Shay
teaches both Chinese and Japanese history and
Professor [Ed] Gilday in the Religious Studies
department teaches East Asian Studies. I think
they'll redesign the concentration somewhat; it’s
expanding it, not changing it drastically. The
addition of Japanese language and literature they
felt was veryimportant to that endeavor, so we’ve
started down that path.

So there’s only one person you’re going to be
hiring on top of the current faculty?

That‘s the plan right now. We’re starting with
one position - it’s a two~year position in
Japanese, a pilot experiment under the Fund for
Excellence, and we’ll go from there, hopefully to
expand on the Japanese part of the curriculum.

Why haven’t we taught Japanese before?
We have done Japanese (in the ALSO
program), but we were concentrating
on Chinese Ithink the Chinese
department was focusing
‘ on the Chinese
department first and
Ithink everybody

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grinnell’s Chinese Studies
concentration will change next year to
become the EastAsian Studies
concentration and will include
teaching the Japanese language

feels that it's time now to expand so that we
have more rather than less in that area. We’re
very committed to making this a vew solid part
of the college’s curriculum.

What are your thoughts an the program?

It's moving forward. The College is really
committed to expanding International Studies
at the College, and speciﬁcally to expanding East
Asian Studies. As long as studentinterest remains
high, because it’s an underrepresented area of
the college, we’re trying to build on what we
have,

 

 

 

 

How long ago was that that you actually
submitted your request and decided that you
were going to go far it?

That was about a year ago that we ﬁrst submitted
a proposal... we had a workshop over the summer
to expand it. But it’s been in the works, I’d say,
since about the time I got here, which was four
years ago.

Anything elseyou’d like to say about the topic?
We have a major symposium on Taiwan with the
Rosenfield program next semester, so there’s
going to be the formerambassadorto China, some
professors from Taiwan. It'll be a pretty major
symposium. I think that a big part of expanding
international studies at a college or university is
having more events outside the classroom.

College.)

not do you know about this program, and

i hat reflections do you have on it in light of

‘ur knowledge of other programs?
5makes sense to me to connect Chinese and
panese: it's often much easier to learn one
fce you've learned the other, so there are
asons why to have a strong East Asian program.
also seems to me there are reasons why you
ould want to have both if possible. There’s
ays an issue in small colleges, as to where
re going to put resources. Certainly this was
ko an issue at Swarthmore, where they also
had Chinese and not Japanese. And also for
language departments, at least my impression is
in language departments these days it can
sometimes be an issue, because other languages
understand that there's only a limited amount
of interest in foreign language, and the more
languages you have, the fewer students per year
take part. But, in general, I think it's a good
idea, in terms ofjust broadening understanding
of East Asia. If you're interested in expanding
East Asia as a whole, Japan would be the next
thing to do.
