SOVIET: State Department WASHBURN: Racism
Watches Middle East crisis

continued from page 4

“The United States and the So-
viet Union choose to play a game."
said Limberg. “Not one they can
easily walk away from.” This is
because of the inherent relational
interests with the Middle East due
to its location.

Soviet support {or United States
policy is another matter. Limberg
believes that the reason for this is
that the Soviets realize that the
United States has a recognized role
in the Middle Est. and want to
achieve a similar role so that both
superpowers are active. This has
been reﬂected in the changes in
Soviet policy in the last month.

When the Secretary of State re-
ceived indications that the Iraqis
were massing along the Kuwait
border. the Soviets assured the
United States that there was no
buildup. The Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait did indeed take the Soviet
govemmentcompletely by surprise.
Limberg said. Thus, when theUN.
resolution placing an embargo in
Iraq was introduced, the Soviets
were hesitant to support it as they
were not yet sure how effective
they thought it would be.

They then startled the United
States when Gorbachev issued the
“most authoritative condemnation
ol‘ Iraqi action, and called for im»
mediate withdrawal from Kuwait."
Limberg related. This condemna-
tion was read aftera Sovietmilitary
exercise in which their army prae»
ticed maneuvers that would be the

type used apinst the Iraqi army.
'IheSovietUnionhasalsoincreased
international support for sanctions,
and called for a political resolution.

Such a condemnation is some-
what surprising to Limberg, as the
Soviet Union has considerable
stakes in Iraq. “The Soviets were
the largest supplier of arms to Iraq
because they saw arms as an inﬂu-
ence in the Middle East." he said.
The Iraqi artns sales were also a
source of hard currency for the
Soviet Union.

Furthermore. Iraq was the So-
vietUnion'sonlyaceesstotheGulf.
So for the ﬁrst time, the Soviet
Union iselecting to appear ina less
than superpower status. because
they fear open military contact.
“The Soviets are also wary of a
lingering presence of the United
States in the Gulf.” Limberg said.

Yet this does not explain why
the Soviet Union has been support-
ing the actions of the United States
in the Middle Fast.

"They really didn’t have much
choice," said Limbergl “They
would have been the odd-man-out
Also, if they went along with the
United States it would add new
openings in the Middle East, so
they feltthat they had tobea player."
This was apparently true, as the
Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia re-
cently reopened diplomatic rela-
tions for the ﬁrst time in years.

Limberg towards the conclusion of
his speech. For this reason,he feels

that although there is now consida
arable agreement between the su-
perpowers on the Gulf, he believes
that there is still much his depan-
ment will have to do.

He also made some general
comments about the development
of Soviet foreign policy under the
administration ofPresident Mikhail
Gorbachev. Most imponanl was
that the Soviet Union now viewed
foreign policy in a much more
pragmatic manner. It was now
looking more at relations with its
neighboursthanThird World client
states “The Soviet Union is less
ambitious." he Claimed. “They are
turning inwards to solve their own
domestic problems." He emphar
sized Gorbachev‘s personal inﬂu-
ence has “had an impact on the
twentieth century” He felt that
Gorbachev was personally vital to
the the success of fundamental
change to the Soviet Union.

Glasnost has also had a big ef—
fect According toLimberg. ithas
involved a complete change in tile
Soviet govemment’soutlookon tlte
world. It has. however, also raised
some problems for his department.
Because of the much greater free
dom the Soviet media now enjoys,
it is now harder “to determine offi-
cial policy because of the conﬂict-
ing voices."

Looking to the future, Limberg
felt that “the Soviet Union will bea
rival and competitor, although in
safer ways. I think it very unlikely
that I will be out of work."

He added, “The Soviet Union
and the United States are much like
two individuals in a car arguing
about which way to go to the same
destination.” This situation “might
not be the greatest," he said, “but it
sure beats the altemative.“
