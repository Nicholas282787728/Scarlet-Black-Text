proposed a system whereby educa—
tional expenses would be shared by
national, regional, and community
resources, and supplemented by per-
sonal donations as well as by moder-
ate student fees

He also hoped to institute a credit
system for courses to allow students
more variety: “All faculties used to
have one set program, and the stu-
dents had no choice... new second or
third-year students can choose [their
courses]...1 hope this can be in-
creased.”

Emst also mentioned a broaden-
ing of the curriculum, greater stu—
dent participation and campus activA
ity as other goals for educational re-
form.

His colleague, Waldemar
Michowicz from University of Lodz,
added that “we have a canteen at

school for the students, but most of
them prefer to eat at home.“ there is
little communication among them.”
Both professors cited sports teams
and activitiesasa means of encourag-
ing student activityr

Asked aboutreactionstoU.S.edu-
cation, Ernst replied, “I feel how
much education is important to Ameri-
cansr t . Americans takeeducation very
seriously,"whileMichowiczadrnired
“the ﬂexibility... the open system of
education."

While not yet sure of specific
changes for Poland, both professors
were enthusiastic about further re-
form. Michowicz laughed,"l bet you
cannot guess how many people were
in my room when l was a student,..
when I started my studies there were
twenty-two people in the same
roomitwenty-two! Now, things are
much better, much bettert They are
getting better."

Peopleof color need to take pan in
the debate and development of a new
world order according to Millus T.
Bass, manager of the Kansas City
School District, during a speech in
Harris last week. In his convocation
lecturcon “The Browning of America:
Implications for a New World Or~
dcr,"Bassstressed ihccounlry'snecd
to reshape the system to empower
and includepeople from varied backr
grounds and races.

Bass listed statistics about the
Midwest to explain the cultural tenr
sions here. He said this area was one
of the last places to accept social
change and the last to support civil

rights. He questioned the Midwest’s
reasoning behind us resistance to
multiculturalism.

Multiculturalism is simply “ev-
eryone sharing a piece of the pie,"
said Bass. Rather than overturning
the system, multiculturalism means
reshaping and redefining it to include
and empower other races.

For example, he referred to lhe
educational failure to empower non-
whites.thheducaLionbeingthe“gzrte
to mainstream America,” according
to Bass, unequal spending for educa—
tion has prevented access for non
whites.

Viewing history as the struggle of
humankind to impregnate the world
with its ideas, Bass proposed that

“when you are at the helm of ideas.
you control the world."

Unfortunately, many believe that
the idea of multiculturalism “exalts
racial pride at the expense of social
Cohesion,” said Bass. This View of
multiculturalism perpetuates the idea
that blacks only bring their style to
the bargaining table whereanew face
of America will be forged.

Bass believes America's dedicaa -

tion to creating that new face lacks
the desire to develop the maximum
potential ofall Americansbecauseit
has wasted so much time excluding
nonrwhites. He asked liberals to re-
mind Ameriea that the nation “can’t
get to the top if she struggles to keep
people down.”

College receives grant for biology equipment

Grinnell has received a $23,000
grantfrom theNational Science Foun-
dation to purchase an ultracentrifuge
that will be used in biology instruc—
tion

Used to separate submicroscopic
particles, the ultracentrifuge will be
used in a newly revised cell biology
course and in upper-level biology
courses and laboratories.

Its integration into the biology cur-
riculum will besupervisedbyCharles
Sullivan. assistant professor of biol-
ogy, and Bnrce Voyles,associate pror
fwsor of biology.

gress’ Office of Technology Assess-
ment ranks Grinnell l4lh among all
US. colleges and universities as an

tific field, in comparison to a 15 per»
cent average at the 20 top-rated pub-
lic and private research universities, ’
