More Support Needed for Jews

ter, l have ﬁnally decided to voice
my opinion on being a Jew at
Grinnell, A5 a Jew who does not keep
kosher, I think it is ridiculous that the
school does not allow for tlkosher meal

In response to Jason Kimclnlzm's let-

pian, Keeping kushcr is a religiDus
duty. not an option I think the admin-
lstrallon is lull oi shit when they can
providc iish for Lcnl (which is ealcn as
a rcliginus duty), but nm a kosher menl
plnn fur the rew students whv kccp koA
shcr McConncll runsancntcrprisctllnt
makes a prom, i am surc that dining
scrvlcc could caSlly zil lord akosherlncal
plan,

The biggest thing that l imvcsacn-
iicctl utcrinncll is my religion. [have
found it difficult to kccp up with the
Jewish calendar here The only thing
roriewsoncampusisChalutzlm, which
did a real goodJob this yearby bringing
ambhilucnmpusrorlhe High Holidays,
Hnwcvcr. there is no on: at Grinnell to
turn to whcn you race the rillcmnm of
being Jewish. itihcrc was it temple in
town, or a Hi1lc|,ora rahhl on campus,

iv “my.

my collcgc ycars would havebeen much
dirterent. After studying religion and
reﬂectingonmyexislenceaslew,lfeel
inadequate because of my lnck of relir
gious practice during my college years.
Th: options for traditional Jewish relir
gious obscrvatlon at Grinnell is EXr
iremer limited,

I have expressed concerns about
being Jewish to administrators and SW
dents and the response I often gel is,
“Well , . you have white skin and all Of
the privileges that go with it." Every
tlmcIhearthalresponse,lfeelasillough
l have lost my ethnicity and the pride
that l have in being a Jew. I have
mentioned to adlninlstmtorszfewltleﬂs
thatmtghthelptomcreasercligiousand
cultural awareness on campus, but it
sccms that they have not tried hunt
enough to i‘ollowihrough on them. I do
not feel that the lack of attention paid to
Jewish students is dons intentionally,
ii’slust the fact that most ofthc admin-
istrators‘ backgrounds (I Cannot name a
JeWishadmmislraior)douoiallowthcln
in undcrstund this Slluﬂuon Consldcr'
ing Ille {act that the studcnt body is
about ten percent Jewish, it would lit:

nice if thc administration was more
awar: of our needs

The administration docs not real-
ize the dilemma of being Jewish. Jews
in Amcn'ca lend to be white, butth we
live with the history of our relatives
being persecuted byWhitesl Beingicw-
ish mcans keeping our tradition going
despite attempts by other: Io end it
Jason's argument shows that by deny-
ing a koshcr mcal plan, Grinnell Cni—
lege IS creating an obstacle for some to
carry out their tradition. Even more.
Gnnnclliscrsatingnn obstacleformany
more students by not being very sensir
ti ve. to the large Jewish student popular
tion.

This letter is not meant to say that
one group is more of a victim than
another, nor that I feel it is necessary to
hire more Jewish faculty and adminis-
lrators ljust think that the administra-
llon should be mare aware of studenls'
needs (maybe that's one of the reasons
Grinnell hasrroublerelaining students)
Overall, ll Is a Statement of how I feel
towards the end of my Grinnell educa-
lion,

support from Matt Haber ‘95 and Jason
Wall ‘95)

ps i was Just offcntled by the school
again when l walked upstairs into the
