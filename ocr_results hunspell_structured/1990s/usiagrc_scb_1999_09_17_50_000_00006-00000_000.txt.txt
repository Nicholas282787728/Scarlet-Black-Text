Smith Senator Brandon Zicha
‘02 saw things differently.

“There is definitely a preference
for not fullyfunding political groups
on campus. Young Democrats can
get money for things like lads to)
get out the vote. but they can't get it
for speakers," he said.

Zicha was concerned about SGA
precedent. “I think student govern.
ment has atrepidation about not
funding ethnic groups on campus.
For example, last year, ASIA came
and askcdloint Board for a lot more
money than FTP for a symposium
they were having and Senators est.
pressed concern about appearing to
not support AsLA. That concern
was not shown toward FTP,”

Paul Ford. ‘02 fecls the problem
does not lie with SGA.

“SGA is being put in the posi»

budget that is obviously too small
to satisfy the activist, religious, etht

FTP asked Joint Board For

for college grads

By Michael Kelly
Yale Daily News

(U-WIRE) NEW HAVEN, Conn. e in a time thn stock options and
lnrcrncr companies are turning 20 ycar»a ulds into millionaires, who would
have thought that most young pcoplc are likely to become cashiers?

In a recent job study sponsored by the 2030 Center, a research and advo»
cacy organization for young adults, labor marker analyst Helena Jorgtnstn
found that young workers today are fccling the bite ofa hostile job market, a
trend some say is echoed at Yale's graduate school.

Jorgensen, an economist for the American Federation ofLahor, Congress
of industrial Organizations and scnior fellow of the 2030 Center, reported
that the median salary for college graduates fell 11 percent between l970‘and
1995.

The rcpurrclaims that this decline in cconomicsrandnids foryoung people
is due primarily to an increase in the number of temporary workers in the
labor force,

In her report, entitled “When Good Jobs Go Bad: Young Adults and Term
porary Work in the New Economy," lorgtnscn said that halfofall temporary
workers are under the age uF3S, and that more than one in four young work.
etc do not hold permanent, fulletimo posltlons,

In addition, iotgenscn predicted that ifthc growth of temp jobs contlnt '
ucs at its prcscnt rate, one our ofcvery six people will work for a temp agency
before turning 35, up from the current ratio ofonc in cighr

The report resembles a study released last April by the Graduate Employ-
ccs and students Organization (case), a group dcdicarcd to unionizing
teaching assistants at Yale’s graduate school. GESO’s study concluded that 70
percent ofall undergraduate reaching arYalc is performed by temporary work-
ers, mostly by adyuncts and graduate student TAs.

GESO organizers said a union ofTAs is the most effective way to combat
this overrrellance on part—time labor.

Following GESO'S report, a petition signed by over 20 professors was
distributed around the graduate school urging faculty members to examine
whether their departments relied too heavily on non-tenurc-n‘ack faculty and
Tim.

university officials have questioned the findings of GESO’: study, and
maintain it rests upon a faulty method ofmeasuting reaching hours,

2050 Center Founder and Director Hans Ricmet likened thc unrest of
some TAs to that ofremp workers in other areas ofrhe economy.

”They’re symptoms of the same problcm that companies are misclassifying
their workers,” Riemcr said. Many corporations will label their employees as
temporary, even though they may work as many hours as ﬁrll-time employ»
ees, in orderro avoid paying full salaries and providing the benefits they would
for their regular employees, home. said.

The 2030 Center’s study claimed that temp workers earn 16.5 percent
loss than they would ifrhcy had fullrime status. Furthermore, rhe study showed
that only five percent of temp workers have health insurance through their
employer, and only 14.5 percent have a retirement plan.

Although TAs at some public institutions such as the University of Cali-
fornia have recently been recognized as employees under state law, the qucs»
tion ofwherher TAs at privarr universities can be Considered‘employccs falls
under federal jurisdiction, and is currently the object ofa legal proceeding.

However, Riemer said TAS at institutions like Yale are subjcct to the same
problcms as falsely classiﬁed temp workers.

“Theyre denied the basic types ofbcneﬁrs [the University] would grant to
its professors; is‘cimcr said ,

While the rcporrsi findings seem to doom future BA. holders to lower
income iobs, its pessimistic conclusions may be questionable.

"it’s true that their have been documented increases in temporary jobs,
but they still compose only a small portion ofrhe existing labor force,” said
Yale economics assistant professor Ann srevens, who specializes in rhc study
oflabor markers.

stovens said that although she has not seen the 2030 center's report, she
would be surprised ifyoung people were ﬁnancially worst offnow _. when
the economy is at record.low levels ofunemploymcnr _ than they were in
[hc recessions of the 1970s. Furthermorc, the tight labor markct found in
some ﬁelds of academia is a totally separate phenomenon from the strong
overall performance ofrhe economy, srcvens said.
