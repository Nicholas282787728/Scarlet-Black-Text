“1 think that the concert will be
really enjoyable. spirituals have an
austere beauty that no odicrgcnrc pos.
scsscs They are unique because all
spirituals take a variety of musical
backgrounds and combine them with
fervent religion to make a beautiful
product," said Rommcteim.

Paul Carlson ’02, said, “I've en»
joycd working on this music. It pro»
duces a special feeling inside or you.
The concert should be really enjoyable
for anyone who likes to heat good
music."

The Community chorus is one of
the few groups on campus that in-
volves both members of Kim faculty
and of the town itself, Rommcrcim
said, “Involving members of the fac-
ulty and community is what really
gives the Chorus its charm. it's great
for the students to actually see the face
ulty in an environment other than the
classroom and to actually hang out
with members ofthc town.”

"Adults come from as far as New-
ton to sing in the choir,“ Rommereim
added, “impressive when you consider
that that is 40 minutes of driving to
get to a rehearsal that lasts less than
two hours.”

Ircnc l’owcll, Associate Professor of
Economics, said, “it’s a lot of fun for
me to sing with the students, it's a
real Joy to see the Chorus in action."

Carlson said that working with

There are some

members ofthe faculty and the com-
munity “is great for everyone in-
volved."

The Chorus has been rehearsing
once a week for about an hour and
forly»ﬁv«: minutes weekly since the
beginning of the year. “ [The Chorus]
really works hard. We have a lot of
fun together," said Rommereim.

Also, the Grinnell Singers will be
performing with the Community
Chorus. “It’s nice to have as many
voices as possible up performing. The
Singers help to fill in sections that the
Chorus is short ofmembers in They
help to balance out the sound,” said
Rommetcim.

Ron-imcreim is also excited about
guest soloist Marcya Daneil from the
University of Iowa. “she has a great
soprano voice that has the spirit to fit
right in to ‘Go Down,” said
Rommereim.

Powell said, “I hope that as many
people as possible go to this concert
it, as well as the YGB concert on Sun-
day. It should be an excellent exhibi-
tion of musical talent in action,”

“it’s always nice to see your friends
in action on stage doing something
that they love. I hope a lot of people
get out to see us,” said Carlson.

Rommercim said, "This concert
will be a great chance to get a sense of
our sometimes forgotten American
choral traditions. Besides, it’s always
great to see a variety ofhumans com-
ing together to make music,"

it serves as a musical haven. [They]
find comfort, peace, and rest for their
mind andspirit. itswharcveryouwant
it to be in any positive aspect you can
think of."

Mason is one who finds solace in
YGB: “[ch is] spiritual outlet forme
on this campus where i could relax,
be myself. . . . it’s always comforting
to know that there’s an outlet for me
on this campus that i can go to [where]
lcan get spiritually and physically ene
ctgized." He stressed that YGB is not
entertainment, but “a part ofthe body
of Christ whose greatest aspiration is
to give God the glory."

Both Mason and Williams have
extensive backgrounds in gospel mu-
sic, performing it all their lives. Will.
iams ms raised in a religious home,
and began playing gospel music when
he was five years old. in his late teens
he started training voices and choirs,
rising through the ranks to ﬁrst a lo-
cal level, then to a state level music
department.

What Williams finds most satisfy-
ing about YGB is its unity: “When
everyone has the same goal, it creates
a unity you can really appreciate.”

Teamwork, he said, was key to the
group. “Everyone is dependent on

Indeed, YGB is not only unified,
but also diverse, in twenrysorne mem.
bers are ‘ofdiffcrent ethnicities, even
different nationalities. Williams com-
mented, “[We have] a veryvibrant rep.
resenration ofother ethnicities in the
choir. No one is turned away."

Mason elaborated: “In YGB we
accept alliwe want to take anyone
who wants to sing the music. You don’t
turn anyone away because they can or
can't sing. ”

Though YGB’s origin lies in a
group orblack students who came to.

said that popularity grew because of
the music's massive appeal.

“Gospel music," he reiterated, “is

no match for The

More than ever before, animation is
making its way onto the small screen.
From Fox's King ofthe Hill to Com»
edy Central‘s Hal; and Margmtl, car—
toons are cropping up everywhere.
Hell, we've just seen a “[th kiddie
show named Rugrats become No. l at
the box ofﬁce.

But within the last year, the world
of animation has been ruled by four
foul-mouthed brats that live in the fic-
tional town ofSlmt/r Park. With their
say-anything demeanor and crazy ac»
complices, ranging from a '70selike
crooner named Chef to a happy-go-
lucky turd named Mr. Hanky, sooth
Par/r has carncd its share of laughs.
But, as much praise and ratings as the
over-the-top show receives, it pales in
comparison to the best cartoon ever
put on television . The Simpson.

In the laughs department, The
Simpson: beats southparh. 1n the origi.
nality department The Simpson beats
Saut/Ipﬂr/r. And, as the future will
show, The Simprari: will beat South
Part in staying power.

Since its inception in 1989, (it ac-
tually began in snippets between skits
of The Tracy Ullman Sbrw), The
sir/tyrant hasn‘t lost its ability to make
fresh comedy that pokes fun at every»
thing and anything. Many of its jokes
are subtle, a claim that Shut}: Par/z can't
really make. While the Mr. Hanky
character was funny because it was so
unbelievably disgusting, I've never
seen an episode of The Simpmmwhere
they made a character's excrement talk
for laughs.

In a recent episode ofsonih Par/t.
a tidal wave of human waste washes
(is this me right word?) over the town.
Upon watching that episode, it be-
came clear that Sam/1 Park not only
crossed the line in terms of decency,
but diat they also ran out ofideas for
something comical.

You don't see many bodily fluids
in The Simpson. it's never been
needed. The actions of Bart, Marge.
Lisa, Maggie and especially Homer, are
all it takes to have me fall oifmy chair
laugiung. The closest thing Smith Paris
has to Homer, quite possible the fun-
niest character on TV, is pudgy Eric
Cartman. But, many times cartman's
humor is restricted to swearing at one
ofhis friends or being mean.

While animation is not known for
its rich description of character, The
Simpson: far outweighs Swat/1 Par/t.
The trials and tribs or The Simpsons
have shown that their characters are
at least two-dimensional, ifnot three.
The people orsriiih Park are as flat as
the perennial pancake.

Besides being flat, the people of
south Par/earcoficnsiveThe show has
made a name for itselfbccause or its
"uneI’C" nature. Funny, but not for
long. The show's onslaught of jokes
about African-Americans (Chef),
overweight people (Sally struthers)
and gays (something in every episode)
have worn thin. Yes, The Simprimr has"
its stereotypes (Apu and his l<wik.E.
Mart) but they aren't constant fodder
for jokes.

I seem to have trashed 517th Par/t.
Don't mistake my intentions, though.
1 think it's a funny show, but i think
its time in die sun has passed. its nov.
elty is shortlasting, because its humor
goes tor the lowest common denomir
nator. And don't forget mat the show's
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone
have some history with failure
(Bore/retro”, Orgtzzmiz). \

The Simpsons on the other hand,
has wit. From mocking Poe's The
Ratltn to having Homer's girth stop a
nuclear meltdown, the toon hasn't
slowed down orshowed signs ofwear.
The simpionr made it apparent that
you can combine humor with intelli—
gence intelligently. And one last thing.
The Simpwnt somehow made the word
"D'ohl" funn .
