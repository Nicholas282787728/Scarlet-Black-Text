Nuclear Proliferation:

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

Each and every one of us lives every day with the knowl»
edge that human life on the planet could end tomorrow. our
level ofdenial is so well developed that we no longer consider
this unusual. Not only is it deemed normal, but those at us who
argue that the nuclear genie shouldbeplaced backtn the bottle
are labeled quixotic, myopic, insane.

Yet humanity has only possessed nuclear weapons for fifty
years, and we have already poisoned the atmosphere more in
that time than in all previous history combined. We‘ve used
the bomb onhunlan beingstwice (three times lfone accepts the
evidence that the 1944 Port Chicago explosionikilling 320
poor African Americans —was a nuclear test), and threatened
to use it at least 33 times

I contend that policy, not infeasnbility, prevents disarma—
ment. It is worth rioting that no American president has ever
promised not to use nuclear bombs in a firstestrike on other
nuclearstates; no president has everptomised not to inc inerate

clVllianpopulations; no American president hzls ever promised
not to bomb non-nuclear countries (most ofthe 33 documentr
ed threats were against non—nuclear states).

Indeed, in the course of seven years, the United Nations
passed a stream of disarmament resolutions, all rejected by the
United States: for a “South Atlantic Zone ofPeace" (124—1);to
ban nuclear weapons (98-1 ); to ban weapons of mass deSKmC»
tion (1284 ); to ban weapons in space (154-1); to ban new
weapons of mass destruction (135.1), {or a Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (143-2); for an end to all nuclear tests (137-
3). The US was the solitary boycotter of a UN conference on
disarmament held in NYC in 1987. Clinton has since commit-
ted unequivocally to “maintainingconfidence in the safety, the
reliability, and the performance of our nuclear weapons.”

The remainder of this reature will report (as much as
possible without my bias) on the Rosei‘tﬁeld Symposium on
Nuclear Prolireration. There were 7 speakers, all experts with

long vitas. Since attendance ranged from 15 to 30, I will
assume most people did not hear the speakers. Nuclear weape
ons and nuclear proliferation are essential issues, and they
deserve our deliberation and conscious response. There is no
such thing as neutrality where nuclear weapons are con.
ccrncd: apathy is a choice, and it places us with the status quo,

l spent a week listening to these genial, weltedueared,
lnstltutiDnallzed, white men discuss nuclear weapons in antl—
septic terms. six orthese men have research university andUS
government addictions. Five are directly linked to nuclear
weapons research laboratories. There are certain assumptions
which come with these affiliations: none of them can chal—
lenge the basic assumptions oithe status quo, None can point
out that, in fact, “the emperor has no clothes."

Although ] have basic disagreements with these men
(next week), I believe that there is quite a lot to learn from
people who have so immersed themselves in the nuclear issue.

AN INTRODUCTION THE
N PT

The (irst speaker, Dr. George
Bunn, is a professor at the Stanford
University Center for International
security and Arms Control. He was
an attorney working on Various nu—
clear issues throughout the Kennedy
and lohnsan administrations, and
workedspecificallyforthe US Atom»
ic Energy and Nuclear Regulatory
Commissions.

Dr. Bunnexplained the basicsnf
“Nuclear Diplomacy”—the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), se.
curity assurances, and the Intetnck
tional Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) The NPT has 182 Signatr»
ties. It has four principal provisions:
It allows only the (we acknowledged
nuclear states (China, US, France,
UK, and Russia) to have nuclear
weapon . commits them to work in
goodfaithtowardtotaldisarmarnent;
trcommitsthemtohelpallsignatory
nations to develop nuclear energy in
their countries. And finally, non.
nuclear weapons stares promise not
to develop nuclear weapons.

Security assurances are often
referred to as the nuclear umbrella:
i.e. we Will act as ifany attack on a
NATO country by a nuclear state
(Russia or China) is an attack on the
US. Alternately, Russia will act as if
an attack byanuclearstate (US,UK,
France, China) against a Warsaw
Pact state is an attack against them.

NPT enforcement is based on
consensus, consent orthe governed.
The only enforcement mechanism is
security council censure. Because
all ﬁve nuclear states have security
Counctl veto power, censure is un«
likely. Since there is no actual pune
ishment mechanism to be used
against the nuclear states, they can

In 1995, the NPT Signatories
voted to make the NPT permanent
The basic agreements which allowed
for this are nlneefold: first. NI’T sige

sal adherence to the NPT, that is, for
inclusion of India, Pakistan, and Is»
rael. Second. the have states (have
nuclear weapons) promise to work

for a Comprehensive Test Ban (CT B)

in 1996. Third, all states will not
produce any more weapons—grade

elimination of nuclear weapons.

free zones, Sixth, the have states will
take further steps to assure havenot
states that nuclear weapons Will not
be used against them. Seventh, the
IAEA will be strengthened. Eighth,
all reactors will meet lAEA safety
standards. Ninth, all parties have an
“lnallenable right" to peaceful use or
nuclear technology.

This last stipulation was a result
of the US denial olnuclear teclinole
ogy to Iran, despite Iran's total com.
plisnce with the NPT treaty. The
US insists that Iran has a nuclear
weapons program, and so will not
allow it to acquire peaceiul nuclear
technology. lmn, however, has been
cleared by the IAEA.When Dr Bunn
was asked how the US gets away With
this, he responded that “They iust do
it," and reminded us that there is no
enforcement mechanism against the
have states.

CONSTRAINING NUCLEAR
PROLIEERATION: DIPLO-
MACY, DETERRENCE, AND
DEFENSE
The second speaker. Dr. Much—
ell Reiss,is the director of the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development or.

er plants in South Korea. He served
at the National security council
under Bush, and has taught at the
Woodrow Wilson lntemat ional Cen«
ter for Scholars.

Dr. Reiss noted that his alma
mater, Williams College, is more
commonly known as “the Gtinnell
College orthe East," which definite.
ly got him off on the right root: He
began the substance of his talk by
noting that w H Auden called the
nuclear age “the age oranriety." His
talk was broken rnto three parts: why
countries would want nuclear weap—
ons,whymorehzlven’tacquitedthem;
and what we should do about nuclear
proliferation.

Countries want nukes for four
key reasons, according to Dr. Reiss:
security, status, technology, and psye
chology. Nuclear weapons are
thought to make a country more Se»
cure; the US initiated the Manhatr
tan Proiect tn response to Germany.
Nukes are the ultimate security blane
ket. They also bring status. They are
the ultimate political symbol. There
are technological factors, the “If it
can be done, it will be done” idea.
And there are psychological factors,
by which he means that individual
scientists or beaurocrats have a pro
found inﬂuence.

He went on to say that the
real surprise is not the countries that
have acquired nukes, hilt those which
have not. He noted protest move.

agreed with Dr. Bunn that the NPT,
security alliances, and the cast of
nukes were the key reasons more
states have not built them, He also
suggested that protest movements.

Finally, Dr. Reiss suggested

the speciiics or other country’s cul«

daiigerousfallacy They are calculat—
ing and intelligent. They may mis—
cnlculate, but they are not idiots.

The greatest challenge, ac—
cording to Mr. Rerss. is to remember
just how diiierent nuclear weapons
really are The danger is that we
might forget Hiroshima and Nagasar

ki. “We forget at our own peril."

NORTH KOREA: A CASE
STUDY

The third speaker, Dr. Steve
Fetter, isaprofessoratthe University
of Maryland. He is also a comultant
to several us government agencies,
and was the US representative dur—
ing North Korea’s Iiuclearcrisis a few
years ago. In the past, he has worked
at the DOD and for Lawrence Liver—
more National Laboratory.

Dr, Fetter told us a story about
negotiations with North Korea be»
tween February 1993 and October
1994. Several people present came
merited that Dr. Fetter seemed to
think oithe whole issue as a game,

Motives behind North Korea’s
nuclear weapons program include:

the us threat on multiple occasions
tousenuclearweaponsagainstNorth
Korea; the us iirststrike policy,
which dictates that the us believes,
in general, in using nuclear weapons

off the coast, the presence of us

spirit" exercises which the us and
North Korea hold jointly each year,
staging an invasion ofNorth Korea.

Thecrisiscame in February 1993
when the IAEA requested a special
inspection or a plant which North
Korea claimed was not a weapons
plant.NorthKorenlmn‘ledioXElVEClVe
their 90 days notice (allowed under
the NPT) of withdrawal irom the
NPT. This was the ﬁrst time the
IAEA had requested such an lnspec»
tion, and North Korea claimed a
violation oi its sovereignty.

The reasons, according to Dr.
Fetter, that all this is crucial to the
United States are three—fold: the US

that North Korea might sell its nur

to terrorists.
