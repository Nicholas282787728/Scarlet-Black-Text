Off-Campus reality

Birds happily chirp at you as you wander out your front door. As the sun
glistens over the roof of the house across thestrcct, you look out your window
to see if anyone is getting mad atyour blaring "Smells Like Teen Spirit"as
loud as your speakers will go, You See no one is, and so you turn it up just
a bit louder.

Ahh, the dream ofoff»campus housing. But is this dream really as close as
many innocent Grinnellians think?

OK, so you and some freinds want to live together next year. You put in
an application for of [campus housing so you can lease this funky old house
down on Park Street. And you wait.

Meanwhile. the landlord has been
pestering you, your freinds and all
your close family members he can get
his hands on trying to get you to sign
alease. "Need tokriowby tommorrow
noon, ‘cuz a couple from Dubuque is
coming to look at the place in two days if y‘all don’t want it," he says. Great.

So you stall him. What should you do? Sign a lease and fork over a large
downpaymem before you even know if the college will allow to live in the
house in the ﬁrst place, or tell him to forget it and let the folks from Dubuque
take away the house of your dreams? It may not exactly the rational thing to
do, but you really want the house, so with a sigh and one last longing glance
at your account balance, you sign the lease. And you wait.

Finally, the fatefull day, April 15, arrives, You skip to your mailbox, heart
aﬂutter, hoping the collegiate gods have graced you with the permission to
live in a house you've already begun to pay for.

Now lets just stop the story right there. Yea or nea does is not the issue .
this entire episode should never have happened in the firstplace. It is true that
there are exceptions to the rules. If you are a senior, have a child, or are over
22, you automatically receive permission to live off campus. But the process
for people who wish to live in off»campus housing who do not meet these
requirements is time-consuming and very costly. By the time they find out,
many applicants have been forced to sign leases, and if they are not given
permission they are left with a legal problem with the landlord and with
scrambling to ﬁgure out who they can live with in time for room draw. All
this because of your dream to live with your freinrls.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Iowa Peace Institute unveils new
defensive missile system

To the editor,

Sunday evening on Norris fourth
saw the birth of a silly idea. In sheer
defiance of the grave Grinnclliari ate
mosphere we resolved to resuscitate
the campus humor by composing the
following April Fools day farce:

"April 1, 1992 TO: Campus Come
munity

FROM: Office of Admissions

SOMETIME BETWEEN 11:30
AM. AND 2:30 RM. TODAY, the
Iowa Peace Institute will be testing a
new defensive missile along Eighth
Avenue. Students are advised not to
cross at this time in order to stay clear
of the testing Zone. The college and
the institute cannotbc responsible for
the safety ofany who do notcomply.
Please plan accordingly."

Unlike the “War of the Worlds,”
this clearly could not cause tenor,
riots, destruction of property,pillage,
rape, incest, or confounding of ad-
ministrative processes. This is so ri-
diculous that no one capable of sur
viving Grinnell could possibly be-
lieve it. Even if they had believed it,
no harm could have been caused; at
worstEighth Avenue would have been
clear for three hours. This type of
humor is not unheard of. In fact, on
April ﬁrst NPR broadcast an hour—
long call-in farce discussing with Ri-
chard Nixon his plans to run for re
election this year. Even ihotigh call-

ers believed this for up to a halfhour,
theylaterfoundituproariouslyfunny.

The plan progressed smoothly;
hours oi‘ photocopying, numbering,
ordering and bundling notices for
every student box yielded exactly
what was called for on the signs out-
sidcthcpostofficc. Late in the evening
of llic3lstwe mailed these in thepost
office. When we checked our mail
Wednesday morning,wcfoundnoth-
ing but newspapers and earplugs.

Thepostperson atthewindowtold
us that the notices would notbedeliv-
cred because of two trivial failings.
We had not written each natne with
the box numbers, and the office of
admissions had not actually issued
them. It was clear that we were get-
ung [headministraliverunaround. All
studentsfrequentlygetmailwiihonly
a box number: apparently that was
notenough in this case. We chose the
office of admissions as the “sender"
because it was completely implau—
sible. Someone nonetheless took it
seriously.

It is troubling that an administra-
tion which claims to promote opens
ness of ideas would suppress some-
thing sent through the mails. Why
should the mail on campus be more
restrictive than the federal mail? If
our noticse were libelous or in viola~
tion of rules, we should have been
brought up on charges rather than

suppressed. Farclcal speech should
nonetheless be free speech.

This should be the first step in the
Glorious Revolution to restore bus
mor to this uptight and somber cam»
pus, We hear tales from the past of
calls forcheerleader tryouts,curfews
with bed checks, and other pranks,
and are saddened that no one has
continued this grand tradition. Where
did all ofthese people go? Have they
allgraduated,leavinguswithnothing
but serious politics? Or is there inn
stead, somewhere in the bowels of
Physical Plant, a warehouse-sized
room filled with the pranksofthepast
four years? If the latter is the case,
then we need to htuiti together and
spraypaint the faculty, because by
now lhey'vestopped reading. Wethc
students are the only ones bored
enough to actually read something
like this all the way through. Maybe
pranks are a good way to alleviate the
boredom. We need not. be bureaucra-
iized into normalcy and monochroe
matic lives. Let your imagination
break free. Just remember: always
wear your safety goggles, because
it’sallfunandgalnesunlil somebody
105% an eye.

Viva la farce!!!

Seniors beware: reality approaches

When peopleusk me how my break
was, I’vebeen telling the truth, which
is that it was a little too reality-orir
ented tobereltixing.lwent up toThe
thn Cities to check out thc job,
school, and apartment market in Line
ticipation of next fall. Yes, I am a
senior, and as of May 19th or so, my
parents are officially booting me out
of the nest, I’ll Cilhcr fly or make a
really profound splat within the next
year.

Actually. the situation up ihcrc
isn’t so bad. Apartments can always
be found tit a reasonable price, and
Jobs are available, if you’re not too
picky. I’ve always wondered what it
would be like to deliver newspapers
or flip tofu burgers for a living, and I
think I'll have the opportunity to find
out in the near future.

Themaintraumaucdccisioniface,
which came into clear focus over
break, was what to do about further
schooling. I would like to learn more
about business, to prepare for my
ultimatcgoalofbeingarichandpow-
crful businesswoman who owns lots
ofpoliticallycorrect,interestinglitde
businesses. But since Grinnell had
little to offer me in this regard, my
first step will he to Hike some busi-
nessclasses. Iwould like to take these

atihc University ofMinnesola, burns
a nonercsidenl, these quarter-long
classes would cost $800 each for the
first year. That might be a little hard
to manageonapizza-delivery-woman
salary. So I took a serious look at my
other option: classes at a community
college.

The Cities contain a myriad of
community colleges, most of which
have classes that would transfer to-
wttrd a degree at the U. These classes
would cost about $200 each, or one
fourth of what they would costat the
U. Soovcr break,1wns determined to
check out the community college
option.

[visited threeoflhclocalcolleges,
and was particularly impressed wtth
tthinncapolis ComtnunltyCollege.
The buildings were aesthetically 3p»
pealittg and clearly labelled, and the
college Presidentis a black woman. It
certainly doesn’t hurt that their carn-
pus is across the street from the Ama-
zon Bookstore and Ruby’s Cafe, an
awesome restaurant where men and
feminine women are equally rare, if
you catch my drift.

Yet as I wandered the halls of the
main building, I found myself think-
ing, okay, this IS a viable option, but
do I really want to follow my Bach-
elor of Arts from Grinnell College
with somepiddly classes fromacom~
munity college? I mean, who goes to
contmunity colleges? People who
can’tgotorealcolleges.Whoteaches
at community colleges? People who
can’t teach at real colleges. Commu»
nity colleges must be pretty inferior,
compared to Grinncll.

I caught myself in midrthought.
Whoa, Alanna! Have you become so
accustomed to an expensive, private
college Settlngthat you can’tcvcn see
yourself at a Communlly college? I
went to a public high school, and I
know that many of my classmates
went to the local community college
at home. Iguess I would see it com
munity college as returning to a high
schoolleveloflcamingrshallwesay,
somewhat less than highly intellec-
tual. Has Grinnell spoiled me? Is this
classist?

Or am I just being realistic? A
future employer might be inclined to
value university credits more than
community college credits. I have to
