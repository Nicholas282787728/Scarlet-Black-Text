ENEW FILM: VanSant WASHBURN: Crimes of leftist
f explores father—son rulers remain unpunished
frelationships

‘ continued from page 6
‘ Henry IV7 Shakespeare is listed in
v the credits as a contributor of“addl-
tional dialogue." Also, there are sev-
'eral points where the film resembles
x Orson Wells‘ version of the Falstaff/
’ Prince l-lal plot, Chimes/1! Midnight.
From a psychological perspective,
- the movie can be seen as a confused
‘ attempt to show the relationships be
tween two young men and their fa-
‘ thers, and the problems which go
, along with them Scott has to choose
between two fathers— the Mayorand
‘ Bob, who is a type of surrogate “far
, ther" and mentor— while his friend
Mike is consumed with the desire to
‘ find his unknown father and missing
. mother. However, the incestuous
overtones in therelationshipbetween
'Bob and Scott, and the hints which
. imply that Mike’s brother is really his
fatherblurtheissue, leaving the movie
‘ void of any clear father/son theme.
> The best parts iii the ﬁlm are those
>which show the streets of Portland
and their down-and-out inhabitants,
-which are the type of scenes which
>insured the sucess of Van Sam’s two
previous movies. One of the most
’ powerful shows a handful of hustlers
. in a mstraunt, the camera randomly
ﬂicking from one to another as they
‘ talk. The hustlers are all smiling and
xintially seem to merely be indulging
in basic banter, but the Viewer graduv
’ ally realizes that the stories which
.rthey are relating are actually shock-
Jnglyhorribletimes whercthespeaker
was raped or cheated by an older
"‘Customer"7the only potential tar
.tlterrfiguresIowhichthcywouldhave
access.
- However, instead of continuing
_to show thecharacters without bias as
he did in, Van Sant slips into senur

mentality, making the hustlers seem
freer and more honest than theirbour-
geois counterparts, glorifying their
way of life. Also, Scott. and Mike’s
trip to Italy (Van Sam’s attempt to set
thestageforScott's eventual betrayal
of his friends) seems unbelievably
contrlvcd, and is one of the weakest
sequences of the film.

Considering, however, that My
Own Private Idaho is Van Sant‘s first
original screenplay, the lack of clar-
ity in the script’s ideas is comprehen-
sible, and much of the confusion is
balanced by the high quality of the
acting. The greatest strength of the
movieisRiverPhoenix’sportrayalof
Mike.Althoughthctcmptationwould
be to play the character for pityi the
poor, abandoned narcoleptic kid in
love with selfish Scort— Phoenix in-
stead unselfconsciuosly presents a
believable and honestly touching
character, without any unnecessarily
sticky sentimentality.

On Gus Van Sant's “coming soon”
list are a version of Tom Robbin’s
novel Even Cowgirl: Get the Blue:
forTri-Star,starringMadonna;ajoint
endeavor with actor/director Paul
Bane] on Victor Bockris’s The Life
andDeath ofAndy Warhol: and plarts
for a ﬁlm based on Tom Wolfe’s
novel of the 60scounter-culture, The
Electric K001»Aid Acid Test.

Like Stanley Kubrick, one of his
role models, Van Santprefers to work
With small crews and unusual sub»
jects, Although this preference might
cause his next release to be a while in
coming, it should be well worth the

My Own Private Idaho will be
shown on Friday at 7:30 pm. and
Sunday at. 3:00 pm. in the Harris

Liberals may ignore or even ap-
plaud hideous crimes by the left. But
somehow it is always mey who are

Buchanan has been saying this for
years, and attacks like the Register'r
only confirm it.
