LasrTuesday, February 23, Jeremy
Youde ‘99 prescnred his Global De-
vclopmenr Srudies research in a talk
enrirled “An Occasion For Hope? The

p Efrecrs ofHIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe.”
Youde tepattcd.tl1c errecrs or HIV/
AIDS were widespread, based on re-
search Youdc eonducred while in Zim-
babwe over rhe Spring 1998 scmesrer.
HIV infects an estimated 21.8 million
people worldwide. In 1996, oirhe 11
million Zimbabweans, 1.4 million ante
rlcd HIV—100,000 children and 1.3
million adulrs, or 20.3% ofall adulrs.

Estimates for rhe {more are even
bleaker: beiween 1995-2005, 1.7 mil.
lion Zimbabweanswill have died from
AIDS, and over 200,000 will develop
rhe disease each year.

Thar gloomy hirure, Youdc said

from donor narions. Because supporr

Alrhough in ocean away from rhc
Unired Srares, many of rho problems
associared wirh Zimbabwe’s HIV/
AIDS epidemic arc paralleled in
AmericaYoudeexplained rhar in borh
Zimbabwe and rhe US, people are
relucranr ro ralk abour AIDS.

Pcoplc in mm counrries rend ro
srereorype AIDS as rhe disease or rhe
promiscuous. '

Americans, Youde cominued, rend
to perceive AIDS as rhe gay man's dis-
ease, whereas In Zimbabwe AIDS is
seen as rhe disease of prosrirures and
immoral men; 92% otHIV rransmis—
sion in Zimbabwe resulrs from unpro—
recred hererosexual Inrereourse.

“The arrirude roward AIDS on
campus is one ofinvincibility,” Youdc
remarked.

“People reel proreered on a small
campus in a small Midwesrern rown,"
hesaid. “Statistically, it’s probable rhar
some srudenrs ar crinnell have HIV.
But the college doesn’r keep any sra-
tistics.” n

As a cosorganizcr ofcrinnellians
Escalaring AIDS Response (GEAR),
Youde said rhar his research on rhe
AIDS epidemic in Zimbabwe gave
him a broader perspecrive {or his own
AIDS activism.

"In American, people have rhe
impression rhar solving rhe AIDS
problem is abour medicine, rhe quick
Fix,” youde explained. “But in Zimr
babive, people don’t have rhe social
welfare ro rhink like rliai, Medical
rrearmenr for AIDS for one year is
expensive, abour two or rhree rimes tl-Ic
average yearly income in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe Is approaching rhe AIDS
problem from rhe longctctm perspece
rive, rocusing on educarion and pre.
vention programs.“

Youdc concluded rhar several mea»
sures can help curb rhe HIV/AIDS
epidemic in Zimbabwe.

“one measure is rhar polirieal lead-
ers show srronger commirmcnr ro rhe
ﬁght againsr AIDS,” he said. “Stron-
ger commirmenr from (licm will prob-
ably increase rhc likelihood or rhe

Also, rhe Zimbabwean governinenr

is to improve curreiirAIDS educarion

abour rhe disease, rhe more rhey can

Orher measures include rhc pub-
lic promorion of condoms, srronger

well as rhe uninrecred.

“Many otrhese measures can ap-

one abour education," youde tc»

cause we have more resources."

Is there room for hope?
