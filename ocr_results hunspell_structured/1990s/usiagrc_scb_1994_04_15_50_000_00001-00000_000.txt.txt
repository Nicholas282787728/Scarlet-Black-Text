Man with possible ties
to Zywicki murder detained

By Howard B. Horn

UTHORITIES are investi-
gating a truck driver from
Florida who is being held in
Indiana on charges of assault and
attempted rape as a possible suspect
in the murder of Grinnell College
student Tammy Zywicki in 1992.
Jamcs Dante Mackey of Tampa
was arrested outside Southlake Mall in
HobartJndianaonMarch3]. Mackey
allegedly grabbed a woman by her
chain necklace andpullcd her towards
him after she ﬁnished making a call at
apay phone. The woman weaped, but
Mackeychased here Mall security saw
the chase and pursued Mackey into the
parking lot. When police ﬁnally apr
prehended Mackey, they found
women's undergarments and ponto-
graphic material in his truck.
According to the Chicago Tri-
bune, records from the trucking comv
party that employed Mackey show
that Mackey may have traveled
westbound on Interstate 80 through
Illinois on the day Zywicki disap-
peared. The records show Mackey in
Omaha, Nebraska the same day.
These developments were met
with guarded optimism by senior

Nyasha Spears. Spears, who was a
close friend of Zywicki's and a
founderofFearless,commented,“As
far as I know, it is not a real develop—
ment. The media has turned it into a
bigger deal than it is at this point, If
they announce that [Mackey] is a
suspect, then it is big news, but until
then it is threatening ihejudicial pro—
cess by having the media convict the
man before he is even a suspect."

Zywicki was traveling to Grin-
nell from her home in New Jersey on
Augusl23,1992. She was abducted
in LaSallc County, Illinois after she
had car trouble. Her body was found
near Sarcoxie, Missouri on Septem-
ber I in a ditch by an off-ramp of
lnterstateM. Besides the description
of a truck Spotted at the scene of
Zywicki‘s disappearance and a listof
missing personal belongings, police
have had few clues or leads.

Despite the weak connections at
this point between Mackey and the
Zywicki murder case, Spears sees
some good coming from the latest
developments. “It is encouraging to
know that [thepolice] are really work-
ingtomakeconnectionstoothercases
and ﬁnd her killer. lhope the process
continues smoome and quickly until
he is caught and convicted.“

Powers claims affirmative action abuse in latest hiring conﬂict

By Jonathan Cook

HE resignation of Janine
I Sawada from the Religious
Studies department has re
sullcdinasearch forcandidatesiofill
the position, a process uiat professor
John Powers claims has been put-
posefully stacked against him.
Powers. currently sewing a second
yearns a temporary replacement in Reli-
gious Suidies, assci‘lsxl that “If I were a
womanoramembcrofaminoritygroup,
we wouldn‘t be having this conversa-
tion.'l‘heywou1dhavcoffenxlmeurcjob
and been very happy in had taken lL As
it stands, they want to get rid of me

because I'm a While male."

“I do support the goals of afﬁrma-
tive action," he said, “but I don’t think
thathasanylhing todowiih what’sgoing
on now.” He dcsclibedtheeﬁonstohire
a new professor in Religious Studies as
“another case of affrn'rtative action run
amok.”

”Iflwere here forihroeycarsl’dbe
a very strong internal caruiidaie,” said
Powers. “By gcuirig rid of me they can
get somebody in forayear who probably
isn’tparticularly well qualiﬁed. If they
have to hire a white male . . , they could
get rid of him pretty casilyand then they
could get a woman or minonty which is
what they really want"

Speciﬁcally, Powers alleges that

Religious Suidies faculty membershave
substantially rewriuen Sawada’s posiv
tionlomakeitavailablelosomeone with
a specialuaa’on in Japanese or Chinese
religion. “I think they’re going to espe»
cially stress aspecialization in Japanese
religion because that’s the area iti which
I have me least background."

Howard Burlde. who is directing
thedepanment‘s eifonstohireareplace—
merit for Sawada, denied that any such
manipulationhastakcn place. "We made
the decision along time ago. . . that the
primary Asian area we ought to develop
was China and J awn."

Budde aLso refutes Poweis’ claim
that affirmative action is playing an im-
proper role in lhehiring pm. "m we

search for our replacement for Janine
Sawada we will be {chewing the afﬁr-
mative action guidelines" he said. “E9-
sentially wlntitsrys isrhatthedecision

“If the qualiﬁcations are equal,”
continued Budde, “we will give ibepo

Powers countered that he is in fact
the most highly qualiﬁed person for the
position.
