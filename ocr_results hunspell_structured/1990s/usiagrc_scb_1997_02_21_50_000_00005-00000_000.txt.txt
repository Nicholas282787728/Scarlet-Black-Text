LETTERS

TO the editor

 

I am writing this letter as I have a
strong opinion about the recent emer-
gence ofordinances and rules on the
Grinnell campus. As a senior, I have
witnessed the deterioration of the
self-governance that once defined
Grinnell College.

While I am pleased with the
progress that has been made in renor
vating the science building, I feel that
it has precipitated at dictatorial sentir
ment on the part ofthe college. The
science library, in particular, has been
redeﬁned in its purpose. The science
library used to be open 24 hours and
contained no computers or library
monitors. There were no sensors and
people could come and go as they
pleased.

A small group of students. the ma
jority of whom were not even Sci
ence majors, found their niche in the
science library. They would stake
out a desk at the beginning of the
year, leave their books there, study
there and occasionally sleep there. A
certain comradery developed in the
science library: everyone knew each
other’s names and would help each
other with any problems they were
having in classes. When the science
library was remodeled and hours of
operation were enforced, this group
ofstudents lost their niche. The Stu
dents have had to retreat to distrac—
tion ﬁlled dorm rooms and have lost
the communication that oce existed
between “science library people.”
This group that I am refering to was
small, so perhaps ifthe campus Pm,
fers the way the science library is
now it should remain this way. How-
ever, most scientists keep odd hours
because of lab experiments that can
run late into the night or early into
the morning, During this time it is
often convenient to explore the cur-
rent literature or research previous
lab work pertaining to one‘s project.

At Grinnell.thls priviledge no longer
exists.

What infuriates me lnost about this
new science-library set-up is that stu-
dents were asked for their input on
this issue and it seems as if the ad-
ministration did not listen to what the
students said. Last year, a model of
the desks that would be in the new
science library was put up in the old
science/library, It was requested that
students try out the desk and fill out
a form giving input on what they felt
the new science library should be
like. The prevailing opinion of the
science library was that computers
in the science library would be a bad
plan. It would change the purpose
of the science library and be distractr
illg to those who like to study there
regularly. I do not understand why
our illput was not taken ilito account.

PINION
_ Both Sides:

This week's topic: doctor-assisted suicide. This is-
suc transcends party-lines, as it has less to do with
politics than with the issue of freedom. The ques-
tion of doctor-assisted suicide is one of control: to
what extent are we willing to surrender control over
the most intimate aspects of our lives to the govern-
ment'.7 In this regard, the issue is much like abore

tion, yet (to my mind) even simr
pler, for. even ifyou believe abore
tion effects two separate lives, Su|~
cide effects (directly, at least) only
one.

We must begin by admitting that
allowing doctorvassisted suicide
Will not encourage suicide. Any
one who is willing to go to the
lengths that one must go to in or—
der to secure the assistance of a
doctor in committing suicide is de-
termined to end his or her life, and
will do it with or without a
doctor’s assistance. Thus, the is
sue is not one ofendorsing or for
bidding suicide, but rather of al-
lowing or not allowing individur

who intend to commit suicide, we allow these in-

Therefore, anyone who argues that we should not
allow doctor-assisted suicide must explain why
people determined to die must be forced to do so
in a needlessly painful and undignified manner.

we do not allow individuals determined to end their
lives to seek the help of a doctor, they will use what-

I want to make it clear that I’m
not arguing for walkrin suicide
clinics, as some opponents of doc-
torrassisted suicide would want
you to believe. Rather, if a per—
son demonstrates a clear medical
rationale for ending their own life
(like constant pain), and is men-
tally competent to make such a de-
cision. I believe we ought to re-
spect that person‘s right to end
their own life, and provide for
them a means to do so which does
not unnecessarily add to their suf-
fering. I must add that endorsing
doctor-assisted suicide is not the
same as endorsing suicide itself: I
support the lesser of two evils.

ticle by encouraging everyone to attend the Grin-
