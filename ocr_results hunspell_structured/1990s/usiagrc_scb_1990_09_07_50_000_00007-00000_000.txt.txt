COMMON SENSE
The AN C VS. Freedom

Nelson Mandela‘s tour of the
United States in late June
engendered widespread euphoria.
Prominent public officials and
media pundits venerated Mandela
as “a true hero," “a modern day
Moses,” “a mythic ﬁgure,” et al.
On his arrival in Manhattan, he
receivedaticker—tapeparade. which
brought him directly past the
building where I was working.
WatchingitfromaZGth-floorofﬁce,
Iwitnessedstreamsofpaperdrifting
through thehumid air, asmall army
ofpolicemcnandthrongsofjubilant
spectators pressing against the
police barriers for a glimpse of the
“Mandelamobile” as it progressed
up Broadway.

Mandela has become the object
of blind adulation, but the respect
accorded him would be less
troubling if it at least were mutual.
It clearly is not. Despite the
protestations of Cuban exiles and
pro—Israel groups, Mandela declined
to renounce his alliance with
Khadafy, Arafat and Castro, three
devoutenemiesoftheUnitedStates
and the West. During a recent visit
to Nairobi, he demanded, before an
audienccoflhousands,"Whatright
hasmeWest,whatrighthavewhites
anywhere, to teach us about
democracy when they executed
thosewho asked forfrccdom during
thetirneof the colonial era. ” Winnie
Mandela has been even more
forthright. declaring to a Harlem
audience.“Wewantyou to be there
if we go back to the bush and fight
the white man," Mandela and his
wife are against racism?

Mandelahasassenedinspeeches
hisallegiancewiththeSovietUnion
and its satellites, as well as his
animus toward the forces of ‘Nvorld
reaction," or. the United States and
its allies. last February, he said

thattheAfrican National Congress'
tiestotheSouthAfricanCommunist
Party remain as strong as ever. In
accordance with communist
ideology, he intends, once it is in
his power. to nationalize South
African industry and enforce slatist
policies in agriculture, education
and elsewhere.

Struggling for “freedom" has
long served as a pretext for the
terrorist violence of Mandela’s
ANC. This guerrilla faction. backed
by Moscow and comprised mostly
of doctrinaire Leninists. is
responsible for the indicriminate
bombing of civilian areas and the
repulsive practice of “necklacing”
alleged “collaborators.”

Thoughtis seldom given towhat
will ensue should the ANC come to
power in South Africa and impose
its economic plan on the country‘
but to get an idea, we need only
look at South Africa's neighbors,
namely Angola, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique. Abundant natural
resources notwithstanding, they
rank high on lists of the World's
poorest nations, thanks to theirrigid
Marxist systems. Resolutely antir
communist, South Africa has the
higheststandardoflivingin Africa,
for black and white alike, which is
why masses of blacks immigrate
into the country every year (many
of them refugees from neighboring
states). South Africa's racist
policies, long overdue for reform,
are indefensible to any person of
conscience, but neither can one
smile on Angola.

it was ignorance, perhaps a puerile

CAMPUS LAUGHS
The ngh Cost

of Free Parking

Lastsummer,beforelbegan my
new life here at Grinnell. I saw a
canoon by Roz Chast that stuck in
my memory. The cartoon was a
series of imaginary tourism posters
for unlikely places: for instance,
onesaidsomelhinglike“DcadDog,
Nebraska, home of the cheapest
motels itl tlleU S .I" I remember
the camon so well because the
ﬁnal panel said “Central Iowa:
plenty of free parking!"

At the time I chuckled jovially
at the joke. Thinking back now,
the cartoon still makes me laugh,
but not the carefree “yuk, yuk,
yuk” of yore. My laugh has
transfonnedintoanangry“ha,HA!"
which I shriek at the top of my
lungs from time to time, alarming
those around me. It is the bitter
laugh of a marl who has seen too
much, or at least that of a man who
has paid too much for a parking
permit.

Well, perhaps I'm overreacting
to the new parking policy. But
considermybadluck. In the month
following my parents’ decision to
give me a car to lake to school, two
unforeseen events occured. First,
Iraq invaded Kuwait, raising the
possiblillty of a global bloodbath
that would leave millions dead and
even more so nerve-damaged that
they would be physically unable to
recount the horrors they had
witnessed in that desert hell. Even
worse, the invasion caused higher
gas prices, thus raising operating
costs for my car.

The secondevent was, of course.

Simpson

the Grinnell administration’s new
parking regulations. At first the
new policy seemed to be an
inexplicable, unnecessary burden
on Grinnell sutdents. However, it
soon became apparent that the
administration was only responding
to a new Department of Education
decree that read in part “all colleges
must charge at least$20 for student
parking permits." Grinnell, which
stood to lose $34 million in grants if
it did not comply, was forced to
change its parking policy. Those
damn govemmentbigwigs! Always
sticking their noses in everyone‘s
business!

So I don‘t really have any right
to be mad at the administration.
But I am frustrated by the higher
price of owning a car these days.
I’m trying to lookon the brightside
of these changes, though. For
instance,thenewparkingregulation
makes it necessary for someone to
check permits. This provides

students who don't mind rauing on
other financially strapped students.
The gas crisis also has its good
points. Oneadvarttageofthehigher

amount of time that it takes to walk

THE LIBERAL LIBEBTABIAN

Reﬂections of a Fresh Written
on Not-Very-Reﬂective Paper

I pen this article to the melodi»
ous and fruity rhythm of “What’s
Goin‘ On" in my blue notebook
which is officially inscribed with
“Gennan” through the attractive
gold bar of the Grinnell College
logo. Otcourseitislaleatnightand
harsh table-lamp light huns my
eyes. Now thatyou fully know the
aunosphere that is feeding this
spontaneousarticle, you will hope—
fully understand the complex emo
Lions and sensory perceptions fer»
menting not only in my mind but in
the actual being of the pen and
paper. They don‘t want to hear my
radio, I‘m sure of that, and heaven
knows why the paper and plastic
stand for being under that not
”Natural Light" bulb from Hell.
“Mother, Mother. Mother....“

A few days ago my roommate
oonfounded me by bravely assert»
ing that his soap Case/dish was

“pretty neat." Before I could pone
der the meaning of his remark, he
confused me further by asking if
my dish was “pretty neat” as Well. I
picked my dish up and looked at its
rounded,yellow,higheimpactplase
tic construction and observed that.
in fact, it wasa hell ofa lotprettier
than othercheap, mjection»molded,
square dishes I had owned in the
past. And yes, it was neat, too, as
neat as a soap dish could possibly
be: notiﬁed up soap bubbles, no

that the U.S.A. was hopping back
