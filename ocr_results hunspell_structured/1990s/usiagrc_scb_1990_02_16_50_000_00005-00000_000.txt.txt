And he’s a

of about 75
s t u d e n t s
who parti—
cipated in
Teach for
A m e r i c a
Day last Saturday. He became a
teacher for the day, while other
students acted as counselors,
organized games, and generally
hung out with the children who
attended. Twenty youngsters from
Grinnell’s Alternative Happy Hour
in Des Moines‘ inner city came,
along with about 25 students from
the Grinnell Middle School.

Shouts of recognition and
excitement filled the lobby of the
science building as people milled
around, waiting to be directed to
their first class. Laura Johnson and
Chris Gunst, coordinators of the
day's activities, calmly broke the
young students into groups and sent
them off to different rooms. With a
minimum of confusion, the
counselors found “their kids," the
teachers found their rooms, and
classes began

Each group attended three
assignedclasses.withwpicsranging
from science to human interaction
and from monkeys to French. The
styles of the teachers varied as
widely as the subjects.

Dan Warner's talk on the
Panama invasion was like a lecture.
His subjective style brought many
worried glances from Grinnellians
and a few glares from listening
adults.

 

 

 

 

Warner explained the
invasion in very simplistic terms.
He told his students that the United
Satos, who used to be friends with

Noriega, the man to whom, "we
gave a lot ofnioney to be the leader
of Panama," decided that Noriega
"was bad." Warner spoke with
conviction about the relationship
that the U.S. had had with Noriega.
I-lc saidthatwe trainedNoriega,but
then, "Reagan saidthat we wouldn't
be friends with him anymore."

The talk drew little
comment from the young listeners,
but the adults listening shufﬂed
uncomfortably in their seats.

Kris Nass. a teacher at the
Grinnell Middle School, mildly
commented that, "Maybethesubject
was a little above ﬁfth-graders'
heads."

Other subjects, especially
science. gathered more attention.
Tennant extolled the virtues of
“ﬂashy demos," and, judging from
thestudents‘ responses (both young
and old). visual aids were deﬁnitely
the name of the game. Ellen
MacCalIie kept her students
intrigued with a bucket and some
feathers when she spoke about oil
spills Kim Wendel found Lhat her
students enjoyed leating through

graffiti art books. Music and
exercise kept Pleshette Hamb’s
format lively,

Cheryl Thompson brought her
daughter Kristen to Teach for
America Day. Thompson, who
ncverattendcdcollege,washopeiul
thatKristen would go, Sheclaimed.
“Anyone who asks for homework
in kindergarten should go to
college." She found the classes
interesting. and said that she and
Kristenwercboth‘awfullyexcited"
to be there.

The feeling that this was a chance
for youngsters to “experience
college” was especially prevalent
in the Des Moines contingency.
SallySmith,ateacherattlteMottlton
Elementary School, described the
ride to Grinnell on the bust ‘They
had no idea what a college looked
like," she said of the childrens’
reactions. ”They kept saying, ‘15
that it? Is that it?m Smith pointed
out that the day allowed Grinnell
students to seewhat teaching is like
while receing feedback from the
younger students.

Though the Teach for America

Day was a sort of preview for the
Teach for America Program—the
program whichoffers an eightweek
intensive course in teaching [ornon-
education majors in exchange for a
two year commitment from those
graduates to teach in inner cities
and other areas chosen by need—
most of the students participating
did not plan on applying for the
program.

Susan Prout was one exception.
She would like to go on to teach in
rural New Mexico through the
program “It‘sagoodopportunity,”
she said.

Some of the teachers from the
Grinnell Middle School were
wary of the program‘s eight week
training course. Nass. agraduatc
of Iowa State, wondered how
well-prepared the students would
be to teach. “I have a lot of
questions about the trainingiit’s a
short time." she articulated Nass
added. "1 think about my four
yearsttt” Beyond these short-
comings, though, Nass felt that.
“Theconcept is good. Schools need
new teachers."

Julie Miller, a special education
teacher at the middle school was
worried that the program did notre-
quire enough commitment. She
described her student teaching as an
imponant part of her training, and
expressed
wariness at
the case

havetobein '

the call of duty.” she explained.

Johnson and Gunst were not
concerned withtheprosandconsof
the Teach for America program on
Saturday. They were too busy
shufﬂing groups out to lunch in
Cowles and Quad, Gunst was
delighted that Dave McConnell had
“been extremely receptive" to his
and Johnson’s request for lunch
tickets. All the students, as wellas
the teachers and parean, received
lunch. The event also got ﬁnancing
from George Drake’s presidential
fund.

After lunch, everyone filed in to
