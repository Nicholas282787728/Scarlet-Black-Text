The coffee provided for the
competition was from the same
stock of coffee that was used last
year — coffee that has been at
Bob’s almost as long as Bob's
has existed. However, most of
the participants deemed it at least
potable. SophomoreSarah Pilteh,
a contender for the unofficial
coffee»drunk-relative-to-bodyrweight
prize, said, “The Coffee wasn’t half
bad. That‘s howl was able to stomach
seven cups.“ Pillch later reported se-
vere paranoia, and explained, “I‘m
sure it was directly caffeineerelate ."

However, the detrimental physi-
cal effects of drinking colossal
amounts ofeoffee in a short period of
Lime weren’t as intolerable as some
participants expected.

“Ifeelfine. It‘snotsobad,” said
second—place finisher Darwin
Clupper,afterfinishinghisfourteenth
cup. “It‘s all psychological, I think
It‘s all in your head, really."
