to Grinnell did not cause much culture
shock because Australia is inﬂuenced
by the United States.

“They drive a lot of Fords and
speak English, so there was no lan-
guage barrier," Collison said.

“I’m kind of looking forward to
post-Grinnell," she added, “but I’m
excited to be back."

Senior Todd Foreman, who stud-
ied in England and France, is also
awaiting life after Grinnell.

“I’m looking forward to graduatr
ing and living in a larger, more urban
area. I grew used to the advantages of

“Both enhanced lhe study of my

French," Foreman said.

Foreman noted that adjusting to
the sizeofGrinncllafterlivingiiiLonr
don was difﬁcult because Grinnell
lacks the socml advantages of a big
city, but he said that returning to the
Grinnell campus was not as difﬁcult.

“I have a greater appreciation for

very plush. It's a very comfortable
campus. It‘s very convenient," Forcr

Foster stated that the biggest (ill-A

found her return to be a bigger culture
shock than going to London.

“I! was very disconcerting at rust.
but seeing all the people I missed
helped," Howell said.

Howell said that she made a con-
scious effort to adapt to London, and
now that she is back in Grinnell. she
ﬁnds herself convening pounds to
dollars and saying she is “going to the
pub" instead of the bar.

Foster did not experience much
culture shock going to London.

"Being in a country where Enr
glish is the national language makes
the adjustment easier," she said.
Colllson agreed: “It‘s good being
back."
