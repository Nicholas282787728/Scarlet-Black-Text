Their Interests range from traditional
craftspcople to cuttingcedge'entrepreneurs,
from migranrworkers In Asia to public monu—
ments in Fastern Europe.

They are Grinnell’s nominees for 60 annual
fellowships given by the Watson Foundation.
named for Thomas J. Watson, the founder of
IBM. Every year, so schools nominate four
students each for the fellowships, which allow
graduating seniors to spend the next year lmv»
elling abroad to study a particular subject.

”They give [students] 22,000 dollars and
say, ‘Don't come back to the country for a year,”
said Doug Cutcl-iins, director ofGtinncll‘: Of-
ﬂcc ofSocial Commitment.

Cutchins described the concept as being
similar to that afthe «modem/7i, in which chil-
dren of European nobles would spend a year
travelling upon completion of their Formal
schooling. The point, he said, Is to “go out.
see the world, learn that you can live on your
own, 5:: how big the world is.”

Grinnell graduate Margaret Taylor is In
Europ: right now, Cutchins said, exploring
“Space, place and idenriryin me European cir.

circus In Eastern Europe.

“Watson projccls tend to be like that,"
cutcltins said, “They tend to be wildly cre-
ative . . . their one requirement Is that you be
really passionate about that project."

vicwcd 27 applications for the Watson Fellow-
