based on the Zen ldca
rhar one oughr ro “live
as .r you were already

dead," a sraremenr he

inrerprers ro mean “Be
involved, bur rake rhe
long View.”

“Don'r reel morose,
rhe dead man is alive
and dead or rhe same
time,” he said. He liked
working wirh rhe philo.
sophieal elemenr or rhe
rhe poems. “Ideas
should have some dirr
in rhem. ideas should
have marerial proof," he
said,

He also enioyed rhe
form he employed {or

rhe dead man poems.
He views free verse as an
opening, a rnerhod, ro
ereare new forms, In rho
dead man poems he
gives eaeh senrenee a
line “ [The] senrenee is
rhe seerer or poerry, al.
ways has been," he said.
Arrer [lie nrsr dead
man poem, he had nor

pens when you ger
wrapped up in rbe
rorm, you ger obsessed,"
He will miss wriring
abonr rhe dead man.
“I’ve wrirren rhe lasr
dead man poem and
goodbye re rho man or
my dreams," he said.
“I'm really stuck,” he
said. “1 reel as in wanr

bur I don‘r know where
to go."

There is, he said,
“No way ro know your

One ean never know rhe

While he is happy ro

yon, rlie reader, ro ger ro know him,
Robson is a rarher mild—mannered,
amiable person. He is out-going,
and has no qualms nbour voieing
his opinions. He is run in be

Robson has rwo wishes he
would like ro see conic ro rruiuon.
First, he would love ro see sleeping
qunrrers ploeed in rhe nne arrs

who ai-ealmosr eonrinnonsly rhere,
and would aerually like to gor some
sleep from rime ro rune, bur wiil-ie
our having [a rerurn ro rheir dorm

see someone invenr a releporrarion
deviee. This devise would allow {or
rhe releporree ro sleep while pass
ing from one loeauon ro anorher,
speed would nor be an issue. or
eonrse, in aeeordanee wirh rhe no-
