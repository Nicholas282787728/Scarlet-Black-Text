The Gulf Crisis——A Worker's Perspective

Reprinted with permission from

Raving: magazine.

A notion making the rounds in
diebourgcoispressis thatif Saddam
Hussein had been allowed to
conquer Saudi Arabia, he would
use the proﬁts generated by selling
Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti oil to
enlarge his military until it rivaled
Hitler's. What an absurd lie! The
bourgeoisie cannot deceive the
people. We know the real reason
for the United States' imperialist
aggression in the Persian Gulf, and
we will not allow this reason to be
shrouded by fire-and-brimstone
rhetoric.

The exploited oppressed
proletariat of Amerikkka has found
Western “democracy" to be a cmel

we have grown ever more

justice. But George Bush, a clear
enemy of the people, contrived to
draw attention away from theplight
of the workers whom the
bourgeoisie has been raping. He
paid Saddam Hussein to invade
Kuwait, thereby creating for himself
areason to enter theGulf. Operation
Desert Shield has successfully

diverted attention from domestic
conditionswnly a brief glance at
those conditions will show us why
the capitalist imperialists want
everyone to ignore them.

Let me not hear that Hussein,
unless he is stopped, will acquire
nuclear weapons which could kill
millions of
people, far more
than would diein
a brief
conventional war
against Iraq. Let

he comes to adopt a more

we do, that the “democratic

the nght-wing media, that no one

wrong to condemn all of us

Returning to the issue at hand, I
exhori you to bring together a
vanguard to lead a people's
revolution against the oppressive
capitalist, fascist, genocidal.
imperialist, decadent white power
structure. This, lam convinced, is
the only way to effect peace and
social justice. We, the brave men
and wimmin of the working class,
will supplant the oppressors and
establish a worker's paradise free
from suffering and strife, like
Cambodia since 1975 or maybe
Mengistu's Ethiopia. In the cold
lightofrevolutionarydawn,wewill
see with utter clarity who is a true
friend of the people and who is a
running dog of the oppressive
capitatisistruciurc. Workers of the
world (except you right-wing
traitors in Poland and a few other
countries) unite!
