Social reform, relations with Mexico debated this week

Students and faculty discuss U .S.—Mexico afﬂzirs with Mexico experts during week—long Rosenfield symposium

succession of speakers from
A both Mexicoand tthnited

States lectured on topics
ranging from this summer's Mexican
elections toChiapas to U.S.-Mexico
border relations during a three-day
long event entitled “Whither
Mexico?"

The Rosenﬁeld Program in Pub-
lic Affairs, International Relations
and Human Rights and the Latin
American Studies Concentration co-
sponsored thesymposium and supple
mentary scholars’ convocation this
week to inform Grinnellians about
issues arising in Mexico as that
country’s government su'ives toward
reform.

Dr. Luis Rubio of Centro de
Investigacion Para El Dcsarrollo
(Centerof Research for Development.
Mexico City) led the scholars’ con-
vocation Thursday morning in
Hen-ick Chapel.

Rubio lectured on the interac-
tion between the Mexican movements
for political and economic reform.
He explained that while violence pcr~
petiated by insurgent groups has
heated thepoliticalreform movement
in Mexico, the nation also has been
working toward greater economic
security.

“If we look at simply the elec-
tions alone,” Rubio stated, “Mexico
is very close to being a complete
democracy." Indeed, about 70 per,
cent of Mexicans voted during Au-
gust 1994 elections. Driving beyond
the elections, however, Rubio felt
that the future for Mexico will be
“very complicated, with severe ups
and downs."

What is needed, according to

Rubio, are a new system for political
parties in Mexico and better relations
between the present govemmentand
opposition groupsln addition, Mexi-
can citizens would like to feel secure
that a setof basic civil rights will be
consistently enforced.

“Mexican people need to know,”
said Ruhio, “that sudden changes in
power won’t affect their basic rights,
the basic elements of a society, im-
mediately."

Grinnell snidents attending the
convocation and segmenmofthesym-
posium voiced several reasons for
theirinterestin Mexican government
reform.

Those from homes in California
and other border slates took special
interest in the potential impact of the
reform on immigration into the U.S.
in light of the Nonh American Free

Trade Agreement. Others noted the
inﬂuence of conﬂicts in Mexico on
intemationztl ttade.

insight from his conversation with a
Mexican taxicab driver.

“[We] had quite an interesting dis-
cu$ion." said Stallings. “[I leamcd that]
inmepamelecdonshavebeen riggedso
most people haven‘t voted. And since
they haven't voted, the elections have
beenrigged... It’sldndofanever—ending
circle."

According to Stallings, Mexicans
in the past have foregone voting in favor
of painting and posting large signs ex-
pressing their political Views. Signs, he
explained are used in protest of current
govemment policy.
