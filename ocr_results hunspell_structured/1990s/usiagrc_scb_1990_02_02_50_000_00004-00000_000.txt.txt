Introducing Her Third...
Scott Discusses New Book

By Diane Brumley

You have probably heard of
her; there aren’t many who
haven't. Meet Kesho Scott,
American Studies professor, Wife
and mother of two, renowned
scholar, national lecturer, andiin
her spare timeﬁauthor.

Scott’s first book, Tight
Spacer, earned her an American
Book Award in 1988. Co»
authored with her aunt and her
best friend, the book was,
according to Scott, an
“autobiographical creation
[which] recorded slices of our
lives as Detroit, urban. black
women."

A vivacious combination of
charisma and self-confidence
(“I’m a brilliant teacheriit‘s
true”), Scott believes that black
women have “modeled a very
unique form of femininity to this
culture,.,that creates a model
Superwoman, which I believe is
making us nuts. I don’t want
white women to be like me in
terms of superwomanism; that is
a societal creation as it is. I want
society to change."

Scott‘s second book, The
Habit of Surviving, is at Rutger
University Press, and will be out
in the fall of 1990. It is a
compilation of four biographies
of black women born in the 30's,
raised in the 40’s, and who
became parents in the 50‘s. The
lives of these women are
compared with those of their
children—bum in the 50‘s, raised
in the 60’s, and who became
parents in the 70’s. The book
refutes the superwoman model,
and conveys the discovery that
“Survival Ain’t Liberation,"

Already in progress is Scott's
third book. co-authored with
Laurie Ourlicht, a former scholar-
in—rcsidence in the Grinncll Art
Department, The book was made
possible by a grant from the
Puffin Foundation in New York,
and will be titled Picture: No!

inspired by the Grinnell group
“Shades," and is about people of
blended heritages. "There is a
tradition in our culture to ignore,
to make invisible, love beyond
socially~acccpted borders, and yet
there has always been love
between various ethnic groups.
This is the true key to why
racism is ridiculous, because you
can‘t tell somebody that their life
is not valid, if they are made of
love."

Scott and Ourlicht found that
people of blended heritages feel as
though characteristics of their
identities are ranked, and that they
only feel comfortable in a group
if those characteristics are
accepted. “We believe that
characteristics of one's identity
cannot be ranked. People of

How does this (excuse the
term, Kesho) Superwoman find
time to write? Laughing, she
replied “I enjoy writing. And
you make time to do the things
which you enjoy.“ She added, “ll
also answers a lot of internal
questions for me. I have to write
to survive, and to keep my
memories of my experiences
growing up alive.”

Unlike professors at many
other colleges and universities,
Scott has not felt any pressure
from the administration for her to
publish. “I haven‘t had the
experience here with my
department that what I publish;
or don’t publish—is a
requirement for remaining at
Grinnell, What I have gotten
here is a lot of support for the
work that I have already done,"
While sitting at her desk with a
coffee mug bearing the words
“Those who can, teach. Those
who cannot, find some less
significant line of Work", Scott
said that her priority lies in her
teaching. “Grinnoll gives me a
lot of room to do both. My
writing is the best way to keep in
tune with my teaching skills,“

Beginning a New Era of
Freedom in Prague

By Tom Klouda

Andrew Dailey has been a
good friend of mine for a while,
We became friends during our
sophomore year of high school.
Now a student at Swathmore. he
was studying in Grenoble while]
was in London this fall. When
we decided to travel over our
breaks, we did not expect to
witness the beginning of a new
era of freedom in the world.

Originally, we weren‘t
exactly sure where to go. I've
always had an interest in my
Czech heritage, so following the
events of November, we planned
a visit to Prague. l got my visa
in London, and telephoned my
father. asking him to send any
info on my relatives in Bohemia.
Unfortunately. I never had the
opportunity to find them.

Andy and I met in Munich,
and took the night train to
Vienna, arriving at 6 am. on the
28th of December. With a map
from the information center, the
Czech embassy was our first
stop, Andy ﬁlled out his visa
while I waited in the always
growing and lively queue. The
embassy was packed with people.
Luggage cluttered the floor and
passports were flashed about
every time I turned my head.
Most of the people were Italians
who decided Czechoslovakia
would make a unique Christmas
vacation spot. We met a few
Japanese, Germans, and
Americans, and I chatted a hit
with a fellow from Australia.

By talking with various
people, I heard the rumor that
Vaslav Havel would be sworn in
as the Czechoslovakian president
the following day. As I tried to
learn all I could about the
inauguration, Andy paid his 240
Austrian sehillings, and we were
on our way.

The train for Prague left at
1:45 pm. Western trains usually
seat six people to a box in second
class, but this Eastern Express
was designed to cram in eight.
For an eight hour ride, we
purchased some mineral water,
biscuits, and tangerines. In
addition. the heater in our box
was broken, and couldn‘t be
turned off. To regulate the
temperature, we were forced to
constantly open and close the
window. It was a long trip but
the various languages that filled
the air, along with a variety of
hoots and hollcrs, made it a
lively journey. ‘

It was easy to determine when
we crossed the border. About ten
guards searched the train and the
air began to stnell like oil fumes.

There was little or no light along
the Czech countryside, the train
station looked more mndown, and
the station signs changed from
Lhe blue and white of Austria to
the dirty gray and black of
Czechoslovakia,

We remained in the station
for almost 45 minutes. Then the
door slid open, and a young
border guard with a briefcase
snapped across his chest requested
our passports. He glanced
through them for a second and
then stamped them twice. along
with our visas. Then two
women came by for currency
exchange. One asked me how
long my visa was for, I replied,
”Six days.” She then figured from
her chart that I must exchange
8120. At the time, there was a
mandatory exchange of 30
Deutsche marks or $20 a day,
that has since been repealed. The
notes were very old, printed in
monocolors, and were as soft as
tissue paper.

At the station, we were
greeted by a myriad of fliers
plastered all over the walls.
Everywhere I looked I saw
“HAVEL” or “HAVEL FOR
PRESIDENT," Once outside, the
ﬂiers covered everything, and
Havel‘s picture was in every
window and available Wall.

The next morning on the
street we were, once again,
greeted by pictures of Havel on
each window. Some had lipstick
on them where they had been
kissed by adoring citizens. We
quickly realized how muclt this
man meant to these people.
Stopping at a pastry shop in
search of Kolaches, we just
happened to “catch a radio
broadcast (in English, no less)
that reported Havel would be
instated as President at about
noon at the palace, Along with
most of the city, we boarded the
metro and headed for the palace.
Not exactly sure which stop was
for the Palace, we just followed
the crowd that poured off the train
and formed a long stream of
people heading up a hill.

I was very impressed wilh the
crowd. They all remained calm
and rather orderly, The students
appeared to be the organizers of
everything. All through the
crowd I spotted young women
and men with stickers on their
chest, back, and around their arms
that identified them as students
for Havel and democracy.

Once inside the palace, we
didn’t have to wait long for for
Havel‘s appearance, The
applause was incredibly loud
when he arrived on the speaker’s
platform. He looked very
confident and polished. I wasn’t
able to understand what he was
saying, but I did understand the
crowd‘s chants in Czech of“Long
live Havel" and “Long live
democracy." President l-Iavel
spoke only for about ten
minutes.

It was an incredible time to
he in Prague. Everywhere I
looked I could see the genuine
joy and gratitude that the Czech
people felt for this wonderful gift
of democracy and freedom they
had been given.
