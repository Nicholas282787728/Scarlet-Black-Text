Concerts Plan
is Misguided
and Unfair

The recent suggestion that
students pay toattend someconcens
demonstrates a complete disregard
of college policy and tradition by
the proponentsof the plan. Grinnell
has not regularly charged admission
for events on campus, regardless of the performer and activity.

The Concerts Committee made the suggestion as a way to attract
”bigger name" bands to Grinnell. While this goal of bringing more
recognizable entenainment is admirable, the suggested method is not.

One of Grinnell’s u‘ademarks has been that it provides quality
entertainment without havmg to charge for admission. The cost of the
entertainment, particularly ﬁlms and concens, is provtded through activity
foes. Allstudents pay activity fees. Therefore, all students should beahle
to attend the events paid for with those fees.

The Concens Committee may claim that the “big name" conccrts will
be in addition to the regular concerts slated each semester. But they will
still use funds generated from student activity fees The few thousand
dollars from student aetivity fees used towards the special events would
otherwise be spent for lesser acts that everyone can enjoy.

It the committee were to charge for concens and not sell enough tickets.
where would the remainder ofthe paymentcome from? Again, the deficit
would be provided from the student activity toes. The cost of the concert
would then be paid retroactively by many students who may have been
unable to attend/because of the admission foe.

The ﬁnal issue involved is whether the ability to be involved in campus
events should be decided by a students financial means; Five or 10 dollars
may not seem likemuch, but for some students it is. Admission tocampus
events should not be determined by the amount of cash in one‘s pocket,

Cross Country Team

Deserves Recognition
for Historic Success

The iiurpio Roos have been one
of the most successful Grinnell
teams over its history. But this
year’s tremendous success is
especially admirable. Last week,
the Purple Roos, the men‘s cross
country team, became the first Grinncll tcitm ever toqualify for a national
championship. it did so when it plttced third at the NCAA Division III
Midwestern Regionals.

In order to qualify for the championships, the team had to place in the
top four, There were concerns about whether the runners could achieve
this, but they were even able to place higher than expected, quite an
achievement in what is one of the toughest regions in the nation.

Qualifying for nationals is especially exciting because Grinnell was
selected to host the national event this Saturday. The college‘s runners
should expect an extra edge because of their familiarity with the course at
Oakland Acres Country Club.

As they run in the championship, they certainly deserve the support of
the entire college community.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Survivor Condemns Newspaper
for Stance on Take Back the Night

To the editor,

ljust want to thank the Scarlet
andElack [or giving such a perfect
exampleofwhatsurvivorsofsexuai
abuse go through on a daily basis.
Society is always telling us: “It’s
your fault”;“Whycan'tyoujustget
over it, it‘s over'l"; “Just don't tell
anyone, it will be our little secret";
“lust handle it; you're an adult“;
”Rapcdocsn’treally happen”; “You
liked/knew him; it couldn’t have
been rape."

On Monday, Oct. 29, several
survivors took the biggest risk of
their lives: they came forward to
tell their stories. Many of us were
told at the time of the abuse that
we would have been killed if we
did this. Certainly, a lot of us tried
to tell when we were smaller,
only to be blamed or not believed.
This is what happened this time.

_ TheScarlet andﬂlacksaid, “Darrin

you, how dare you not tell 1200
people the firsttime'! Whatiswrong
with you. Why can’tyou just be

perfectly public? You’re selfish
andstupid, Wewouldn’thunyoui
trust us,“

The issue here isn'texclustvily:
EVERY Joumaltst is asked to take
things off the record. if theScarlet
andBlack staff can’t handle that, it
will not make it very far in
journalism. The issue here is fear.
Fear of survivors, fear of the fact
thatYOUmightbeasurvivor. Fear
of the fact that YOU are at risk of
becoming a survivor.

Please don't let this paper
cloud the issue. We stood up for
ourselves and told our stories.
This was a WONDERFUL AND
BRAVE AND HONOURABLE
thing to do. it was NOT Selﬁsh,
un-American or anything else
that the Scarlet and Black was
trying to make it seem like. We
havearight to deftneourspace. We
have a right in reclaim our power.
Respect us. We are strong, and
the Scarlet and Black is mirroring
the fear that society has
trampled us With for centuries.

Please don‘taccept it. Fightback!

Survivor or rape and abuse

EDITORIALREPLY: Atnopoinl
has the Scarlet and Black cvcr
claimed that the speakers were
”Selfish”or“unaAmcrican."lnfact.
the Scarlet and Black Said in
explainingitseditorialdecisionthat
the speakers were courageous.

Nevertheless. the attempted
exclusion of the media from
covering a matter of public record
remains atissue, Aninterview may
be granted “ﬁfths-record” status,
but not a speech that is given for
anyone to hear. Heather-Jeanne
Pylecondemned this newspaperfor
attempting to report what was said
to 1200 people, assumedly the 1200
people that comprise the student
body. Sincesignsoncamptuinvited
every student to attend, the Scarlet
undBlack would only have reported
what those students had already
heard.

Strait Missed Meaning of Flag—Burning

To the editor.

This letter is in response to
Heather Strait's article on flag
bumtng in last week‘s Scarlet and
Black. Strait was bothered by the
burning of the flag because it is the
symbol of the United States, a
countrythatsheverymuchrespeets.

However, as she describes it, the
flag was bumed for “frivolous"
reasons, not as a symbolic
statement, so she shouldn’t have
been so quick to take offense. To
use her own analogy, the burning
was comparable to a person sitting
alone telling“faggot"and“nigger"
jokes to themself, but not finding
them funny. Few people would
find Such an act offensive because
it is not the act that huns, it is the
meaning vested in it.

If the burning was in any way
symbolic,itwaslodcmonstmtehow
blase we can be in this country
towards oursymbols. lthink this is
a wonderful strength. Powerful
symbols can be uplifting, but they

can also be used to manipulate. By
detaching the meaning from our
symbols, we see notonly thesymbol
for what it is, butcan more clearly
examine, criticize and praise that
which itrepresents. In idoltzing the
ﬂag. Strait mistakes the symbol for
what it stands for.

Ltkc Strait, i take the flag to be
symbolicofeverything this country
has done and stands for. Thus, for
me, it is a symbol of contradiction,
My ancestors worked, and soldiers
have died, to give me the freedoms
I enjoy (including being able to

burn the flag), but these freedoms
are founded on genocide, slavery
and imperialism.

“The blood ofour soldiers stains
each stripe,” and the souls of my
ancestors is “sewn into each Star,”
but 1 don't know where the blood
and souls of Native Americans are.
I am both proud of, and nausealcd
by the flag. it is as easily scorned as
respected.

A final note—there is no
“constitutional right to happiness,”

Strait‘s Column Tcrmed
Offensive and Overblown

To the editor,

lwtts doeplyoffended by Heather
Strait‘s column (Nov. 9). I believe
she infringed on my constitutional
right to read the paper in peace.
How can one read the paper
peacefully knowing that sentences
such as “The souls ofour ancestors

are sewn into each stripe, the blood
of our soldiers stains each stripe.”
could be lurking in the next
paragraph? While Strait has the
rightto heropinionsandoverblown
writing style, wouldn’t it be more
courteous if she...kept it to herself?
