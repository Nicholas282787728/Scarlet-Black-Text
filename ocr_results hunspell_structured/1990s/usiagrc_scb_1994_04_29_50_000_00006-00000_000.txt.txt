having people on Cowles’ ﬁrst ﬂoor
is an unusual silualion for me col-

and while Ihere iszl benefit in having

I would like Ihc dnlnk pcoplc
held responsible for whal Lhcy do
while Lhcy'rc drunk. Alcohol IS nol
an cxcusc. If you can't ﬁgurc out
your limil. and abide by ll, you in“:
no placc touching alcohol. If lhcsc
people aren’t hcld rcxpcnsiblc, and
it’s conceivable lhdl Lhcy mighl not

lhen Lhc organizers of lhc Ham's pnrr
tics. lhc ones who arrange lo dispense
{rec unlimilcd amounls of alcohol lo
everyone, including mlnors, should
be rcsponsiblc. Eilhcr the drunks
need 10 clean up Lhoir em. or the
pwplc serving the alcohol have lo
Inkc rcsponsibilily. This principle
has much precedenl in Iowa courts
alreadyt

Drinking has its place. and so do
the drunks, but il shouldn‘l be on
Cowlcs first.
