Professors perform at Herrick

TheGrmnellCollege music fac»

and professors to yoin three of its
members in a recital today, at 3:00 in
Herrick Chapel.

addition to composmons by Marcel—
lo Benedetto and Leonard Duck, they
will interpret two of Benjamin Brit-

compositions of Kent Baird in 1991

Jonathan Knight is performing
in another faculty recital next Fri—
day, but there is no student reCital
this week or next. In fact, the numer—
ous performances of music faculty
members in recitals is one of the
greatest learning opportunities for
students, claims Terri Knight.

“I learned a lot through hearing
my teachers perform," she said.
Knight sees great importance in mu—
sic students attending these faculty
recitals because it enables them to
“learn by hearing." She also agrees
that the performances of students in
recitals is integral as an “affirmation"
of this teaching.

The attendance and interest of
professors from other disciplines for

all musicdepartmentrecitals, Knight
believes, is a show of support for
fellow faculty and for their students.

Withthis recital tonight, Knight
enters her seventh and final year at
Grinnell, and perhaps the title of a
Band composition they are perform—
ing acutely describes her feelings:
“Lament." She and her husband,
Jonathan Knight, director of the
Grinnell Orchestra, th1 be leaving
the College at the year’s end.

Yet, the achievement Mrs.
Knight leaves behind at Grinnell is
the oboe studio she worked to estab—
lish. Overall growth in the music
department,"leaps and bounds”wrth
the orchestra, pleases her, and she
expresses faith in its continued de—

Casablanca

The PBS American film series
singles out Casablancaasone ofa few
legendary films to come out of the
Ametican cinema. is has been said
that most of the successful love Sto—
ries are based on danger and self
sacrifice. so it is tvirh Casablanca.

Casablanca was based on the
unpublishedMunavBurnettplava—
erybody Comes to Rick '5. Aside from
being a remarkable movie, there are
also some unique points about the
filming of the movie. Ingrid Berg»
man (MGM loaned her to Warner
Brothers for$25,000), who plays op<
posite Humphrey Bogatt (although
Ronald Reagan was originally slated
to play the part), said the cast had no
idea they were making a film that
would become so important, and,
because three different endings were
shot, the actors didn‘t know the final
outcome until the film was released.
One of the alternate endings involved
Laszlo being killed at the airport,
leavmg Ilsa free to marry Rick.

Manyprofessionalsandnon—pro—
fessionals alike consider Casablanca
to be the greatest moVie ever.

Casablanca will play Thursday

November 2 at 9:15 at the Harris
Center.
