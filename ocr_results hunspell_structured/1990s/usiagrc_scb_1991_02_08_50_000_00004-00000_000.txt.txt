Welcomes possible McGovern candidacy

By Sarah Purcell

Congressman Dave Nagle (D-
Ia.) spoke in South Lounge Febru-
ary lst on “the crisis in the Middle
East" to a large crowd of students,
faculty, townspeople. and the Iowa
press. Congressman Nagle‘s visit
to campus was sponsored by the
Rosenfield Program in Public
Policy,IntemationalRelations,and
Human Rights.

Nagle described his visit to
Grinnell as a continuing part of his
efforttomcet and talkwith asmany
ofhis constituents as possible since
thewarwithlraq brokeout. l-tesaid
that among his constituents he has
found that “there is anger. . there is
fear. .thercis hope"concerning the
war and that he is actively seeking
toexchange feelings andideas with
the people of lowa’s third district.

Nagle commented on the hos-
tilities in the Middle Eastt He said
hehadbcen mesmerized, likemany
Americans, by the vivid television
pictures of “a thousand points of
light in the Baghdad night." Naglc
assured the audience that he finds
the “military is committed to war
Without ground involvement” for
as long as possible, although he
warned lhatthe war“is notlikely to
stop" any time sdon.

Nagle, who voted against the
“War Resolution" in Congress,
maintained that although before
January 16 he “felt the War was
unwise,” the troops must now be
made to feel “protect " and “sup-
ported," He also stated his view
thatcivil disobedience was an inap-
propriate form of protest, a view
which became nationally contro-
versial when he ﬁrst aired it at a
large peace rally in Des Moines on
January 20.

However, Nagle was generally
very supponive of those who wish
to protest the war. He mentioned
“marches, demonstrations, and
prayervigils"asexamples ofeffec»
live protest and said that he did not
think protest and. support for the
troops were “incompatible."

In his opening remarks Nagle
also addressed the question of draft
reinstatment. He said the“chances
atenotgood”becausethewarwould
have to last longerand require more
personnel than anyone had ever
anticipated. However. if the draft
were to be reinstated, Nagle said
the question of including women
would be “hotly debated,” but that
he thought eventually it would be
“a male and female draft.”

Nagle also said that student de-
fcrments would only allow under-
graduates to finish their current
semester of work, or for seniors to
completetheirdegmcs. Later, Nagle
said that he was “not inclined" to
vote for a draft, but that he would
likely supportinclusion ofwomen,
as long as they were assigned to
non-combatant military roles.

Topics of discussion in the ques—
tionnandeanswer session following
the speech ranged from the alleged
lackofVision of theadministrau'on's
“new world order" to the move by
Rep. Henry Gonmlcz to impeach
President Bush.

Nagle was engaged in serious
discussion over his vtews of civil
disobedience by several people in-
cluding student Scott Whiltstruck
and Mike Smith, a Grinnell minis-
tcr. Nagle said that he did not like
the view of the United States as
“have gun, will travel.”

He argued, however, that the
"the less inﬂammatory the atmo-
sphere, the better the chances" of
creating a climate in which Presi-
dent Bush can accept a diplomatic
resolution to the war. He said he
aimed to avoid adangerous “polar-
ization" in the country between
those with different views of the
conflict atid hoped that a “mature
country" could “handle debate and
discussion“ without falling apart.

Nagle assured the audience that
hethoughttheAmericanpublicwas
fairly well informed about the war.

When the role of the war in the
Iowa caucuses nextyear was raised,
Nagle was asked about the lack of
any apparentDemocratic presidenr
tial candidates. He replied that,
although he understood the wish to
keep a low profilc, “If you want to
be President you ought to have the
courage to run for it.“

In an interview after his appear—
ance, Nagle commented on rumors

thatGeorge McGovern may run for
President on an anti-war platform:
“I‘ve alwayslikederge. Alleast
he‘s got the gumption to stand up
and take a position...l wouldn‘t be
disappointed to see him throw his
hat in the ring."

Nagle also said that he has been
“haunted" by the many calls he has
received from the families of ser-
vice women and men since the war
began. He thinks the war will last
“months rather titan weeks," but
hopes that a diplomatic solution
can be acheived soon.

Israeli
academic
warns of
insecurity

By Rina Khan

David Vital, a Professor of Di-
plomacy at Tel Aviv University
and chair of the department of
Jewish Civilization at Northwest—
em University, gave two talks this
week focusing on the Israeli die
lemma in the Middle-East regard-
ing to the Persian GulfWar.

Vitaldidboth his undergraduate
and doctoral work at Oxford Uni-
verstty. He has had wide experi-
ence in the field of diplomacy,
having served for eleven years in
the Israeli Foreign Ministry. He
has also written extensively on in-
ternational politics. Hislatestbook,
The Future ofthe Jews, was [sub
lishcd in 1990 by Harvard Univer
sity Press.

Vital‘s first tatk outlined four
major problems faced by Israel as a
consequence of the Gulf conﬂict.
These dilemmas, he argued, are
faced not only by the military and
the government, but by the entire
population of Israel.

The first dilemma is the Imqi
attackon Israel by IheScud missiles.
Vital viewed the accusations made
bysomethatlsraelwastheinstigator
of these attacks as a “big lie, but an
effective lie." He explained the
damaging effect on Israel’s policy
of deterrence as a resultof accept-
ing (1.5. pressure to refrain from
retaliation.

Vital argued that in view of
Israel's tiny dimensions, it was the
ability toeffectively respond to Arab
attacks that gave the country a sig-
nificant psychological advantage.
He argued that Israel‘s decision not
to respond may have a “heavy cost
in the future."

Vital added that if Israel is at—
tacked by unconventional weap—
ons, it would be “impossible" for
the government to not respond.
