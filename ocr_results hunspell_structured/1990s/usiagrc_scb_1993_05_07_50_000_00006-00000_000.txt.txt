BILL
TRAN-
SOENDS

By Tom Zlabinger

THE pull ot resislence,

is the result ot persistence

By not being here,

I will reappear

And so I drink from the cup
of existence.

The adventures are all true,

And they may belong to
you,

And on your special day,

I bet you’ll say,

”Bill always knew what to
do."

Greet the day with a “Hit"

Reach beyondthal sky!

Absence is truly an illusion,

And the past will be at the
luture conclusion.

So until then: Goodrbye,
goodrbye, good-bye.

By Howard B. Horn

BORTIONtsoneoithemost

sue strongly support their Side, and
compromlse seems unlikely.

Many people in Grlnncll ttrc also

One campus group Lhtlt is working on
the prUrlllc side is Grinnellians l'or

“I feel that llle pro-life position
on thiseatnpus Is under—represented,"
commented Catherine Carter, mem-
berol‘GrinnelltansforLil‘e.“It‘pcoplc
have a decision to make [about the
abortion issue], it should be an in
formed one." Grinnellians for Life
has worked to provide the campus
with tnfonnatton through establish-
ing contacts wnh Slate and local
groups and by staging events such as
Celebrate Life Week.

Celebrate Life Week featured
several speakers talking on “novel"
aspects of the movement such as the
role of l’cmlnlsm in prerlllc. Also,
Celebrate Life Week featured a bake
sale with proceeds going to the non-
political group Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC), a group that gives

member Tara Neavins explained.
“PAFA is very prorcholce but recogr

While the issue is debuted on
