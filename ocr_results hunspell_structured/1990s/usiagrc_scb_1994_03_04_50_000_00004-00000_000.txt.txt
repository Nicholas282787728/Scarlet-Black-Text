- Asian-American Experience

Rno, the son of Korean immi»
grants, grew up in Cincinnati, majored
in physics at Harvard and received his
MFA in poetry from Brown Univer-
sity in 1991. For the subject of Clever
[and Raining, he chose the experience
ofAsian-American familicsinlheMid-
wcsl~a subject, Rno said, which has
not been explored much in theatrical
literature,

The Grinnell production of
Cleveland Raining was initiated by
Peebles, whose mother is a third
generation Japanese»American.
Peebles heard of the play in summer,
1992. when it was given a reading at
the Seattle Group Theatre. Peebles,
who was raised in Kansas City, said
that the play’s subject attracted him
right away,and that hewas impressed

“In the three Asian-American
characters,you'reabletoportray more
viewpoints," Peebles commented. “In
a lot of instances where you do have
Asian-Americans in plays, especially
when lhere'sjust one, you run the risk
of perpetuating or creating a stereo-
type,

“Theidealsituationislobeableto
portrayals muchofthe complexity and
diversity of any one group as you can,
This play handles that well,” said

- Breaking Ties to Past

Even with its focus on the experi-
ence ofimmigrantfamiliesin the Mid-
west, Rno said that the play has a

message for the general American au-
dience. “Everyone goes throughalicnr
alien and identitycrisisin thiscountry,
regardless of how you grew up," he
said. “It would appeal to anyone be
cause it‘s very honest."

Stage manager for Cleveland
Raining, sophomore Brigid Rielly.
described how the play speaks to the
Grinnellaudiencc: “itdeals withchzlrr
actors approximately our age, at ap-
proximately our locale, and I'm sure
many Grinnetl students have family
siuiations that are falling apart," she
said.

The play will be refreshing to

ing to Peebles. “You ﬁnd a lot of

produce Cleveland Raining at Grin
ncll. Peeblcs spent the summer re

to direct a play that connected to hi

Rno‘s play, but had not made a deci

Peehles was in Grinncll when th
ﬂoodsstarted,and he was reminded 0
how the four characters in Clevela
Raining make preparations to surviw
an apocalyptic liood. “Since ﬁoodin.
is such a big element of the play, I t‘el
very compelled to take that as a sign,
he said.

“The ﬂood interested me beca

Peebles said. “When people Watt:
this play, no one is going to write 0
the [bed as just an illusion"

r Director’s Experience

Pecblcs said that directing an all
student producuon has been both ehal
[enging and rewarding. ”The hardt;
partabout being a director, especially .
Grillnell, is that everyone has their id .
and wants to get them out there, an
perhaps whatmakes iteven harderis th
they're not all bad ideas." P6617165 said

”You have to bulanceexecuting
single, complete vision—which yo
need to pull off a play—but also t
makeroom foreveryone involved," h
said. “It's a harder job when you hav
people who aren‘t just content bcin
followers."

Peebles said that independent
minded people are characteristic 0
Grinnell, but considers that an advan
tage despite the challenge it presents
“I'm very lucky to have had so man
resources at my Command, via ill
people."
