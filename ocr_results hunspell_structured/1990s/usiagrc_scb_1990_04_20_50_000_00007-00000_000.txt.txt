LEI'I'EBS TO THE EDITOR

Hippie Quote Misconstrued

To the editor,

My comments iii the April 13
issue of the Scarlet and Black were
grossly taken out of context, and
conveyed the opposite spirit in
which they were intended.

First of all, the prorchoiee rally
was not an “opportunity offered
Grinnell students” for us to make a
lot of noise and maybe get
interviewed on television. I care
very deeply about the issue of
reproductive rights and am proud
to demonstrate my commitment to
the cause working for society to

View women with dignity and show
respect for our choices. I support
anyone with a similar personal
imperative to stand-up for their
beliefs.

I resent the common occurrence
of dismissingcommitmenttocauses
as merely political fashion. I feel
the label “hippie" is used in such
dismissals and therefore is actually
harmful to social development and
change for the better. Webster
deﬁnes “hippie" as “any of the
young people of the 19605 who. in
their alienation from conventional
society, have turned variously to

mysticism, psychedelic drugs,
communal living,avant-gardeatts.
etc." (Webster’s New World
Dictionary 2nd edition.) Although
I have nothing against this choice
of lifestyle, dismissing all activists
as “a bunch of hippies” undermines
true comitted work not necessarily
forautopian world but fora society
which recognizes the immediate
ramiﬁcations to humans and our
environment of negligent human
behavior and attitudes. This is the
spirit of my remarks.

Ward Attacks "Sham" Election

To the editor.

I am writing this lcucr to inform
theGrinnellCollegecommunity of
. therecentrun-offclection recently
held bySGA. In thisclcction,Pcdro
Femzmdez-McCarthy beat Scott
Truesdell by TWELVE votes.
However, the election wasat worst.
a sham and. at best, reﬂected the
gross incompetence of those
involved. I am astounded, no
shocked, that this miscarriageof
justicewould occur on our campus.
The following discrepancies were
noted: therewereNTNETEEN more
ballots counted than there were
names crossed off; there were at
least two hours when the ballot box
was attended at the post office by a
single individual (neither of these
were Election Board committee
members); the ballot box had been
opened byRobKillion(whoopenly
supported Pedro) and the ballots
separated at the post ofﬁce without
one ofScott's representatives. This
violated Article 3, Section 2 ofthc
bylaws; and lastly, there were two
absentee ballots included among
Pedro's ballots. If absentee ballots
wereallowcd,thenScottcouldhave
scouted places that people hide on
this campus such as the library,
Carnegie, and the Science building
on election day. However Scott
was not informed that he could use
absenteeballots. The first and third
of these discrepancies are clearly

grounds for a reelection. The
nineteen votes that were
unaccounted for could very well
have been stuffed in the ballot box
since a person. after having their
name scratched off, could pick up
more than one ballot, fill it out
elsewhere, and during a busy time,
drop them off. Another way these
nineteenballotscouldoffoundtheir
wayintolheuntapedballotbox was
byoneofthetwopeoplewhoopened
thebztllotbox without authoriultion.

Seven out of nine people showed
up to the Election Board meeting to
discuss the above discrepancies.
Based on the evidence, those
members of Election Board that
were present volcd4-3 in favorofa
reelection. However Rob Killion,
who openly supported Pedro, said
that Scott needed a majority of
Election Board, not just of those
members that showed up. That's
ludicrous! Rob Killion, who was
obviously biased, should not have
had any sayin the ElectionBoard
decision. Really, the discrepancies
were so great that Election Board
shouldhavcbeenmeetingtodiscuss
when there would be a reelection,
not whether or not there should be
a reelection. Finally, it is
unfortunate that three people on
Election Board were not able to
maintain their objectivity in
fulfilling their roles as Election
Board members. Society does not
allow these types of discrepancies

in the electoral process and neither
should we. Unquestionably, there
should be a reelection.

(EDITOR'S NOTE)

As SGA president, Rob Killion
is an official, non-voting member
of Election Board. When the ballot
box was opened at the post of fice,it
was done so by two people who
sorted ballots. Article 3, Section 2
of the bylaws states, "A candidatE.
or a candidate's representative. has
the right to ,bc witness to the
countingoftheballotsofanelection
handled by the Election Board."
The counting of the ballots was
conducted in the SGA Ofﬁce in the
presence of both of the runoff
election candidates.

Thepolicyconccmingamajority
of election board members needed
to overturn an election was decided
two days prior to the grievance
hearing, and was passed by the
committee. ,

SGA has no ofﬁcial policy
conceming absentee ballots, but
they were allowed when turned in
at least one day before the election.
It should be noted that, at the
request of Scott Truesdell, the
grievance hearing was closed to the
public. Therefore, the information
regarding the hearing was kept

Letter Gave Misleading
Impression of Linowitz

To the editor.

Those Grinnellians who did not
attend Sol Linowitz's talk and read
the hostile letter in the Scarlet and
Black last week may have a very
mistaken impression asto the nature
ofhis talk. Thisisthecasebecause
of the shallow, intellectually
bankrupt, rcflcxivcly anti-
American prism his talkwas ﬁltered
through by the the writers of last
week‘s letter.

To accuse Mr. Linowitz (who
negotiatedthePanamaCanaltreaty)
of condoning U.S. imperialism by
saying that it was a good thing that
there is now more democracy in
Latin America is evidence of a
pathetic and contemptible lack of
reasoning. Sol Linowitz in his talk
referredtohisconsistantopposition

percent of the Congress) to endorse

Basic Issues
Branstad is Iowa's

Complete Failure

It is remark-
able that the
Iowa Republi-
can party, which has produced such
fine officeholders as Congressman
lim Leach and former Governor
Bob Ray, should produce such a
complete and utter failure as in
cutnbent Governor Terry E. Bran-
slad. Republican stalwarts argue
that Branstad has brought prosper-
ity and good tidings to Iowa, In
fact, the only thing the Branstad
administration has brought is gov»
eminent of, by and for the business
interests.

The governor regularly prosti»
tutes thestatc to companies, hoping
to lure them to Iowa. He offers
them huge tax breaks, economic
incentives, and Iowa's labor force
on a platter. Essentially, he bribes
them with incredible cash rewards
while many Iowans go unhoused,
unclolhed, and unfed. Eranstad
claimsthatthisis“economic devclr
opmcnl." One person’s economic
development, however, is another
person’s fire sale.

Branstad apologisLs claim. he
has brought jobs to the stale! Yes,
it’s all very true. Branstad lurcd

brought in mi-
grants from the
SouthwestandChicago. Secondly.
the plants, once in operation, im-
mediame began violating every
Iowa law. statute, and ordinance
intendedtoprolccttheenvironment.
Tthcy lied about it too. Only the
vigorous cffons of a few environ-
mental activists haltcd the most
egregious violations. More “ml-
nor" violations are allowed to con-
tinue unchecked. Lastly, the miv

luallydo,CarpalTunnelSyndrome,
a disease that cripples their hands
and ends their work at IBP. These
disabled, mangled workers are far
from home, often illiterate, and
consequently become an unbear-
ableburden on the local authorities.
Theseofﬁcials mustflndsomcroom
in Branstad‘s almost nonexistent
budget to aid these unfortunates.
This is Terry Branstad's eco-
nomic utopia. This is his vision of
Iowa's future. It is a bleak, hon‘id
nightmare of plants literally belch-
ing pollution, crippled people left
afraid and alone in an unfamiliar
place,and local govemmcntstrying
to survive on a starvation diet of
state aid. Any state deserves better
than this. Only one course ofaction
remains open to us. We must rise
up in November and throw Balthaz-
zar Branstad and his Money Kings
from the Statehouse. Shall the
people rule? Or shall IBP’!
