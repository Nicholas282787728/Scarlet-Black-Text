The Grinnell has long shown a srrong in»
icresr in swing, but uniil ieceiirly, had few
uuilers open ro iheni Lasi year, Chrrsmplicr
Thomas '00 and Ali 1<aplan '99 roughi an
ExCo class in swing dance. The response was
overwhelming. AlrhougliThomas and Kaplan
had originally planned io reach one class with
18 srudenrs, rhey ended up reaching 2 classes
wiih 20 in each. Fvcn so, rlity sull liad ro turn
over 80 snidenr away. The compcinion lor
spois in due year's .xco swing class was jusr
as home. Recogniiing ilic giear inieresr in swing

Sociciy was formed. Wirli l<aplan as Senior

of ihe 1940's swing era and die neceswing

Sunday from 7:00-8:30 pm. ar HarrisThere,
club members dance in a casual ormosphere,
praciicing differenr sreps and reaching each
orlicr new moves. The mood is very informal,
and sriideni can come, go, dance, and warcli
as rhey please.

Swing dancing oiiginared in Harlem back
in rhe 1920's. Many consider rhe famed Savoy
Ballroom to be rlie birrhplacc ofswing, since
ir was here that rhc hrsr recognized swing
dance, the Lindy Hop, got us name. As rhe
popularity ofrhe Lindy grew, so did rhe num-
ber ofsryles. The Lindy expandcd and became
known as ihe jicrcrbug, also known as Easr
coasr swing. From East coasr Swing grew
such offshoors as Wesr coasi Swing, jive, and
the Boogie Woogie.

Anyone who’s seen ihc Gap Khakis ad or
rhe movie swingers has seen evidence ofrhe
nee-Swing movemenr. Today, swing is every
whereThe swing revival has much ofirs roors
in rhe music scene in Southern California, Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy, for instance, played regu.
lar gigs ar rhe Derby in Los Angeles, thc club
in which Swingers was filmed. Many link rhc
resurgence ofswingwiih rhe ska revival, which
also had it’s roors in Sourhern California, Neoe
swing shares it’s spirir wiih me 30’: and 40's,
bur wiih a modern twist. The music of neo—
swing spans from jump blues ro rockabilly,

big band in ska.

l<aplaii hisr sraricd swing dancing ai 16.
when she and some ofher friends performed a
swing rourine for ilic school raleni show. From.
rhere, she was hooked. “I’ve always been crazy
abour ii. When I hrsr got to Grinnell, no one
knew «wing, and rhere was no one to dance
wiih," -

Kaplan began reaching her friends how to
swing, building srudenr inrcrcsr in the dance.
Lasr year, she met Thomas through a murual
friend. The rwo began dancing rogerher and
decided in reach a swing ExCo class. “Through
ExCu, we've sorr of become known as rhe
swing dancers on campus."

Over rhe pasr few years, l<aplan has no
need nor only an increased inreresr in swing,
bur an increase in srudeni who know how ro
swing. Vanessa Pierce '02, is one ofrhose
people. Said Pierce. “1 think about swing as
much as guys think aboui Sax."

Pierce rook a class in swing and also he
qucnted swing clubs in her home rown of
Colorado Springs, coming in Grinnell, she
was surprised rliar more people were nor inio
swing, “I wish rhere were a lor more people
who were inro rhe scene and broughr rheir
knowledge with rherri."

When asked why rhey enjoy swing, Kaplan
and Pictcc nored many similar reasons. “i ihink
it's just one of rhe mosr brillianrly fun forms
of dance ro do,” said Kaplan." According ro
Pierce, swing leis her relax and ger away from
the rigors ofschool. Borh menrioned iliar danc-
ing with pairncrs conrribured a large pari ro
rhe appeal ofswing. '

The populariry ofswing on campus is ris-
ing sreadily, and hopefully, ionighr's eveni will
pique more people's inreresr, especially mosc
new as swing. “1 really want people to under.
srand rliar rhey don'r need ro have experience,"
said Kaplan, “and rhey can jusr come and
waich. Once they come, rhey're going in wanr
ro dancc."1<aplan hopes ihar swing conrinues
in Grinnell, even afrer ir's currenr narional
popularir'y'fadcs. “My goal is for rhe swing
communiry in Grinnell to conrinue when 1
leave. 1wanr ro come back in for years and be
able ro dance wiih members ofrhe Swing 50v
ciery."

The Scene

Mama by Ingmar Bergman

The underlying srory is rarhcr simple: an
actress (played by Liv Ullman) who suddenly
srops ralking is senr ro recover ar a beach
house with a ialkarive nurse, and during rhis
rime rhe rwo women's personaliries begin to
mysreriously mesh. The film's titlc comes
from a larin word for masks rharaeiorswore
in classical drama; rhus it refers ro juxtapoxiv
iioii oi‘rhe real and rhc unreal and also con.
veys the ﬁlin'slungian overroncs. Dcccptivcly
simple on rho surface, Prrmmt is ofien de.
seribedasoneofihemosrcompleaﬁlmscver

50an is re cinema whai U/yrrer is ro litcmr
rure. As for myself. 1 dchnirely prefer joyee
ro Bergman: ar rimes, Bergman can be way
roo arrincial for my iasre and go overboard
wirh his cvisrenrial inclinarions, This is ccr—
rainly one of his mosr acclaimed and mosr
cerebral films, bur, ofcourse, difficulry in it-
selfis not a virtue; is may easily all be empry

beware: nor only is ii going to be awfully Sc»
rious and difficuli, it could gcr plain boring.

Reﬁne r/ve Rain by Milchc Manchevski

Aftcr an impressive career in music vidr
eos, Macedonian-born and American-edu-
cared direcroi Manchevski impressed rhe
world wirh his Oscarenominarcd fearurc den
bur. Befvvr i/ve Ram is a moving rale ofwar
and love, sold in rhree paiis. Throughatni
rhe srrucrnrs of rhe narrarive is unconven.
rionally nonrchronological and clliptical,
with elaborare rvvisrs in rims and space.

The firsr pair, Words takcs place in rural
Macedonia, a gorgeous place rhar seems nn.
rbuched by rime, a place where rage rules rhe
land. only rhe srareeofeihseari auromaiic
weapons in die hands ofchildren suggesr a
presenr day siruaiion. A young chrisrian
monk has raken a vow ofsilcnce in an an-
cicnt Orthodox monasrery. Onc nighr, he
ﬁnds a frighrened Albanian girl hiding in his
cell, and he saves her from rhe mob, a crime

RevieWS———:l

for which he is punished by being forced ro
leave me sancruary.

Firm, the second story, shows a London
photo editor torn between her dull British
husband and a passionate affair with the
wildehcarrcd photojournalist Alexander,
played convincingly by Rade Serbcdzija
(who is a wcllrknown and ﬁne actor from
former Yugoslavia, whom you might have
sccn in Th: Saint or Bra/km Englir/I).
Scrbcdzija’s Alcxandcr is a man who walks
between two worlds. He has bccomc famous
and won a Pulitzcr Prize for shooting pic-
turcs of war and its victims for Western
media, bur is now tormcnrcd wiih guilr for
having caused a man’s death while an as-
signment in Bosnia. In rhe ﬁnal part eniided
Plates, Alexander, seeking peace, returns to
his narive Macedonian village afrer a long
abstncc, only to lcarn mat his humtland is
about to bccomc thc ncxt battlcground.

Through the chatactcrs, each section is
interconncctcd with thc cthcr two. On a
London street, we see a grafﬁti that rcptars
the enigmatic words of the old Orthodox
monk: «Tim: 7121/" dict, ///e [ire-b 1': not
mind» In her studio, Anne studies thc im—
ages of rhe doomed Albanian girl, and
Alexander's village happens to be the same
place where die young monk from thc ﬁrst
story livcs.

Throughout the film, you have a feeling
rhar rhc sky is abour to explode (hence rhe
titlcl—dicre is a scnsc of instability and pn-
tcntial rragedy in rhe air. Pcrhaps ilae film's
strongest messagc is the global rcaility ofvlo-
lcncc: tensions in far-off parts of (h: world
can affecr your life regardless ofwhere you
are. in rhe words ofa physician (who is a
minor character in Lhc ﬁlm), “war is 2 vi-
rus," which knows no boundaries; it can be
carried =vcrywhcrc and infect us all.

I like this ﬁlm very much. It muchcs
the surface of an absurd and tertibl: beauty
that violcnce can sometimes haw: whcn it is
framed by a talented artist like Alexander
or, becrer yer, Manchevski himself.

Singers, rhe wide array orrasces, cxpcricnccs,
and goals srudenrs bring ro ihe choir arresr ro

Vivek Venugopal '01, Aline Aprahamian
'00, Pat O'Neil '01, and clara Rice '99 each
shared rheir perspecrives,

venngopal, who grew up iii~Madias. lne

Venugopal said rliar he sang mosily Brit»

he grew up in India and “loved it, Iliad been

sighr—rcading wisii'i rhai gear, 1 improved
and john iRoinmcrciml lei me in for rhe- Sec»

Rice has been singing “since [ could ialk.
lwenr m a high school in Georgia ihni didn'i
have a choir, so whenever rhcy needed some»
one in sing for an evciir, iliey would ask me I
was moie iliair happy in do ii, bur I really

missed having a choir io sing in,” said Rice.

Rice was also arrraered ro rhe Singers her
freshman year because of rheir rour destina»
iion. Rice said, “A rour to Carnegie Hall in
New York sounded awesome. 1 couldn'r pass
it up." '

Rice is now rhe presidenr ofrhe choir and
is eurrenrly helping io plan the group's ﬁrst
rrip io rhe Sourheasr uniied Srares.

O'Neil didn'r have much singing cxpcri»

school choirwasn'r rhai appealing: l didn'iwanr
io be a wussy boy," said O'Neil. “1 gor back

Music is imporranr io O’Neil because ir

“Singers also makes me lare for dinner, bur
rhar's all rlgllt," said O'Neil.

Aprahamian is a music major and an axv
