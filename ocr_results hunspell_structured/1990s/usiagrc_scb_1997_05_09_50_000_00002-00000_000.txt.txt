Scarlet 8: Black Friday, May 9, 1997

Buckle up for another larger-than—life summer of entertainment

BY KURT ORZECK
Arts Co-Editor

As the school year comes to a close,
Grinnellians across campus prepare to
head back into what some label “the
real world.“ No more evenings spent
with Reel Big Fish, Soul Coughing,
or Dar Williams; now its time to delve
into the realms of overbearing
Lollapaloozas and Tibetan Freedom
Festivals. And forget about sweet,
heartwarming movies like Shine and
The English Patient. Once again, we
await another loud summer of pricy,
blockbuster movies. like Titanic
(which cost so much that the release
date was set back signiﬁcantly) and
Jurassic Park 2. So, as you hunt
through this raging, chaotic sea of
summer entertainment, here’s a list of
proﬁles to help you make it to shore.

Proﬁle #1: Lollapalooza ‘97

Age: 7 years

Height(Span): starts June 18 in
Florida, ends in Los Angeles on Au-
gust 18

Weight: Afestival consisting usually
of one stage with seven bands, and
two smaller ones with a Variety of
bands, and often more redeeming than
the main stage

Status: The Main Stage tentative
lineup features: Orbital, Julian and
Damian Marley and the Uprising
Band,’the ProdigyY Snoop Doggy
Dogg, Devo, Tricky, Korn, Jon
Spencer Blues Explosion, and Tool
(headliner)

Description: Has Lollapalooza ever
been this loosely connected? Granted,
last year’s Male-orpalooza was the
most un-Lollapalooza-like of all, but
at least there was a tangible link be
tween bands like Soundgarden,
Metalliea, and Psychotira. This year,
though, Lollapalooza looks like its
going after the make-everybody»
happy approach. Could the organin
ers of this festival been more tactful
in selecting the top one or two artists
in each genre of up-and-coming teen
music? In one comer lies ”IX-icky and
the Prodigy, two ofthe hottest techno:
rock artists out there today, yet in the

other corner we also have Korn and
Tool, giving all those hip Mansonr
goth teens something to pollute their
cars with. But isn‘t it nice for
Lollztpalooza to include Jon Spencer,
letting us fading indie~rock fans feel
a bit in touch with the modern music
scene? Indeed it is, for it seems that
Jon Spencer is the only artist thiit her
longs on the Lollapalooza lineup
Final rcmark‘ Don’t forget Failure,
who opened for Soul Coughing,
though many anllrclteese-allemﬂllVCr
rock Gnnncllians wouldjust as rather
forget.

Profile #2: The Tibetan Freedom
Concert

Age: 2 years

Height/Span: New York City, Julie 7
and 8

Weight: A newly-established festival
initiated by Beastie Boy Mike D that
has found the likes of many-a-majoc

Description: Sonic Youth and the Foo
Fighters will be playing all-new ma-
terial, but Without doubt those artists
1 be overshadowed by lovely
Alanis and probably this Stipcdhilig,
too I saw Pavement play in Chl-
cago, and they appear on top cfilieir
form. But it seems like a sun'nountr
able problem With the Tibetan conr
cert is that the big artists are a bit too
big, Sure, attracting thousands of
Alanis fans will raise much money
for the Tibetan cause, but in effect will
leave lilllc room for the people who
wanl to see the "cool” bands play,
And with artists like Bjork replacing
bands like Rage Against the Ma-
chine, the festival seems l0 have lost
its revolutionary appeal.

“Some-

ter the fust movie, Michael

Then, he goes on to write a sequel to
the book, just so Hollywood could
rake in a few more millions into his
wallet.

Final remark: Join the NRFC (No-
RespectrForrCrichton) League and
protest the film like me.

Proﬁle #4: Titanic

Expected date: July 2

Status: Cast includes Leonardo
DiCaprio, Bill Paxton (disaster
movie extraordinaire), and Kathy
Bates. Directed by James Cameron.
Description: It’s always fun to watch
James Cameron destroy things,
Kathy Bates chop off things, and
Leonardo DiCaprio cry about
things. And, with a plotline about a
huge ship destined to sink, there‘s
every reason to expect these perform—
ers to show their best. Not only that,
word has it that the expected budget
for this film is drifting around the
$300 million mark. Don't be sur»
prised ifll‘lls film takes the reigns of
box-office success after Jurassic gets
its chance.

Final remark: The biggest surprise

 

At the movies...
with Nick and Win—

Looking for Richard

We highly recommend this classic
film about the unattainableiparticu-
larly for Grinnell students amidst the
predinals week chaos, suffering from
all the pent-up anger and resentment
for unreachable and absurd goals.
Our tragic heroines are Juanita and
Peg, two sorority girls who have used
their finals week stress and sup-
pressed hostility toward the patriar-
chy to embark on a quest.

Their adventures are not only eye»
opening and thought-provokin g, but
extraordinarily comical; these two
persistent young ladies discover the
inevitable, distressing truth about
“Richard,"
and like
Godot, who
never shows
up, the main
man remains

drinking hole and throws herself at
some fat,drunk guy and hismailrnan
buddy. After hooking the two booz-
crs onto an intense smack habit, she
drains them of their cash, and goes

Grinnell Singers conclude
with varied program

BY PHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer

The Grinncll Singers will perform
pieces from their tour repetoire on Sat

' urday, May 17. The concert will be

held in Herrick chapel at 7:30 pm.
“I tried to ﬁnd pieces with a lot ofva-
riety and pieces that I really love,” di-
rector John Rommercim said.
Included in the performance will be
a piece by Gyorgii Sviridov “He's a
really interesting contemporary Rus~
sian composer," Ronlmercim said.
“This piece involves off—stage solo-
lsts who create a kind of echo, It’s
intense and moody and very beauti-
ful, too. It’s a very striking piece."
The singers will also perform two
pieces by Lili Boulanger, who wrote
“stunningly beautiful music,” accord-
ing to Rommereim. Her works in~

“Evening on the Plains," which is a
description ofa sunset. “It’s moody
and very sensuous,” Rommereim
said.

One piece will be a spoof on
opera. “It’s totally silly, but a good
way to end the year," Rommereim
said.

Although the Grinnell Singers per
formed with the Des Moines Symr
phony for last year‘s Commencement
Concert, the two concerts will be
separate this year. “We don’t have
the good fonune to perform with them
this year," Rommereim said.

The Des Moines Symphony, din
rected by Maestro Joseph Giunta, Will
present pieces by Mozart, Enesco.
Beethoven, and Strauss in a concert
on Sunday,May 18. The concert will
be held at 8 p.m. in Darby Gymna-
sium, and it is free and open to the

about this film is that it hasn't already
been made.

Proile #5: Batman and Robin

Sonic Youth will grace Tibetan Freedom
festival-goers with new material.

Expected date: June 20
Status: George Clooney as the Caped
Crusader, Chris O’Donnell as
Batboy, Alicia Silverslone as Batgirl,
Arnold Schwartzenegger as Mr.
Freeze (“Everybody freeze!" being his
thou ght-
provoking
pun in this
film), and
U m a
Thurman
as Poison
Ivy.
Descripr
tion: OK,
if the
B a tman
s e rt 2: s
wants to
have any
future, it
has to
abide by a
few rules, First, no more doubling up
on the bad guys, Not since the ﬁrst
ﬁlm has the series achieved any attracv
tive rivalry, and that’s because Batman
had only the Joker to Worry about.

Sure, attracting thou-
sands of Alanis Morisette
fans will raise much
money for the Tibetan
cause, but in eﬁ‘ect will
leave little room for the
people who want to see
the “cool” bands play.

Second, enough with the sidekicks.
Chris O’Donnell was pointless
enough in the third film, so adding
Alicia Silverstone was definitely a
mistake. Third, give the
enemies the same pinache
Nicholson did. Don’t ex-
pecteitherAi—nold orUma
to resurrect the introspec-
tive side hadguys used to
have when Jack was
around.
Final remark: What would
a summer be these days be
like without Batman? A
fine summer indeed...
So that's the summer in
a nutshell, folks. Ifyou’re
looking for other shows to
see, I have been hearing
some recent news about
U21ately...don't they have
a new album out or some-
thing? But seriously, folks,
I think all their shows are
well soldrout by now. If you Want
more ban g for your buck, try and catch
Folk Implosion, who’re basically
bound for clubland. Lou Barlow is
working double duty this summer, as
he is fresh off his Sebadoh tour. Also,
the Jesus
Lizardwill
be opening
for a band
too horrid
to put to
print (need
I say more
than “Glycr
e ri n e 7 ”)
...As for
m o v i e s ,
G a r y
0 I d m a n
will rival
H a r ri s o n
Ford in the
. Presiden»
tial thriller Air ‘Fonce One and join
Bruce Willis in the sci-fl thriller the
Fifth Element, while Billy Crystal and
Robin Williams will toot each other’s
horn in Father’s Day.
