Alternative Happy Hour builds a rapport
between Grinnell students, Des Moines youth

By Alison Wade

Two weeks ago today, Grinnell
students helped children in Des
Moines’ near north side build castles
out of cardboard boxes. Like many
otherprojects sponsoredby theAlter-
native Happy Hour volunteer pro-
gram, the castle»building left many
covered in glue and glitter butpleased.

“I'm always coming home with
marker on my face and glitter in my
hair,” said program corcoordinator
Jessica Goodman. “And I love it, I
wouldn’t want to spend my time do-
ing anything else."

Sinceits founding in the spring of
1989, Alternative Happy Hour has
allowed Grinnell students to spend
their Friday evenings playing with
inner»city Des Moines children at
Trinity Church. The program, which
developed as an outgrowth of Slur
dents Helping the Homeless (Poverty
Action Now) with somefrom Cynthia
Carver and Kelvin Howell at Trinity,
has become one of the most popular

volunteer opportunities on campus

“I’ m kind of amazed,” claimed
Sasha Vrtunski. a Grinnell alum and
one ofthe program's founding mem~
bers. “I never had a picture of it grow-
ing like this when we started.”

Panicipants agree that there are
multiple reasons for attending this
weekly program, known simply as
“Fun Night" to the children.

“I feel like I’m making a contribu-
tion to these kidsjust by being there,"
claimed Aras Vasaitis. “I’ve got a
real sense thatl’m helping outacom-
munity that needs it,"

I en Kern sees much of the value of
the program resting in that it “helps
peoplebecomeaware thatDes Moines
is a city, that the inner city does exist
there, and that there are children be-
ing affected by the issues facing any
inner city » violence, for example,
and poverty,”

Goodman recognizes these prob»
lems and thus secs Grinnell students
as being in a unique position for help-
ingout. “The parents of these kids are

 

Harris kids glad to be
Friday Fun Night regulars

By Alison Wade

Among the several groups of sib-
lings who attend the “Friday Fun
Night” sponsored by Alternative
Happy Hour is the Harris family. Five
of the Han-ischildrencurrently attend
Fun Night on a regular basis.

Lorraine, age 8, claims that she’d

‘just be sitting at home" were it not
for Fun Night, Although she likes all
of the activities, her favorite ones
have been crafts projects, especially
building castles.

Twanna, age 9, likes Fun Night
“because you playalot.. .you can eat,
make things, play games, read sto-
ries, [and] dance."She claims to have
liked every one of the activities of fun
night ‘There'snothing bad,"she says.

than “just sittin' around." Although
he claims there is “no one best part"
of Fun Night, he admitted to having
an afﬁnity for arts and cram.

Euroch, age 14, isn't sure exactly
how long she's been attending Fun
Night, butis sure that it’s been “areal
long time," Her favorite Fun Night
activitiesinvolvebuilding thin gs,and,
although shesometimes getsannoyed
with the “baby games," she dmn’t
think she’ll ever get too old to keep
coming. Euroch has been to at least
four of the on»campus Grinnell visits.
and asserted that, without a doubt.
swimming is her favorite recreational
acu'vity here.

Grinnell Alum Sasha Vrtunski.
who has known the Harris family for
several years. believes “they‘re good
kids, always involved in the various
things going on. Anybody who goes

, to the program knows at
' least one of them.“

Programco-coordina-
tor Jessica Goodman
worries that Euroch may
have “way too many re»
sponsibilities for a girl
her age," Euroch usually
takes careofher younger
siblings,which Goodman
believes is hard on a dc~
veloping teen. “She’s a
very strong person,"
Goodman said. “but
that‘s a lot of responsi-
bility for a 14 year-old.”

This, she believes. is
one reason that this pro
gram is of value for these
children,

“Iwant themtobeable
to be ‘just kids’ for one
night a week, and not
dealing with all of these
other problems I how
we‘re offering at least
that,” said Goodman.

facing a lotof problems,” sheclaimed.
“They're trying to feed their children
and pay the rent All we‘re won-ied
about is passing tests, so hopefully
we have the emotional capacity to
really give ourselves to the kids.”

In the past, “Fun Night" activities
have consisted of various games.
dancing, and arts and crafts. How-
ever, cocoordinator Alice Ostdiek
said that “this year, the program is
doing a lot more to provide for the
kids more structure and more oppor-
tunities for personal growth”

Ostdiek points to increases in edu-
cational activities and ”activities
where kids can walk away with a
ﬁnished project to be proud of” as
evidence of this change in focus.

“Whatthismeans,"saidGoodman,
is “bringing books every time we're
there, and making sure that there‘s
always someone willing to read them.
It means bringing in at least one an-
educationalactivityaweek,andother
programs when we can. Board games
can be secondary.“

The program coordinators said the
restructuring of the program in this
way has met with mixed reactions
from other student members This
difference in reaction may be a result,
they feel, of the varied goals of the
different student members.

“We're not in a position to solve
all of these kids’ problems," said
Vrtunski, “but it’s important to give
these kids a safe space, rather than
having themjustbeathome or on the
streeton Friday night. Thatin itselfis
good enough."

Ostdiek, however, remains con-

Kem feels that this committnent
has been demonstmted. “The people
who go, go fairly frequently," she
said. “The kids know we‘re going to
be back again.”

The rapport betwwn college stu-
dents and children has continued out-
side of the regular church-basement
setting. Children have made several
visits, both day-trips and ovemights,
to Grinnell for events such as the
Black Talent Show, the De La Soul
concert, and last semester’s produc-
tion of Season‘s Reasons.

Amy Olson has written letters to
several children over the summer
vacations. “They don’t always write
back.” she said. “but I want to let
them know I'm drinking of them. I
consider them my friends."

Indeed. it is this friendship which
forms the most signiﬁcant motiva-
tion for continued participation in
Alternative Happy Hour.

“There's nothing like holding one
of the kids, or having them run up to
you when you get there,” said Kern.
“I get so much love from these kids,"
said Goodmanr “It makes me happy
They’re wonderful. I don’t want to
spend my time any other way."

"It's so much fun to watch these
kids grow," Ostdiek warned.“Aftera
couple of times, you’ll be hook .

vinced that “the kids get more out of

the program than we think. Often, we
don’t give ourselves enough credit,"
Goodman agreed, asserting, “Why
should we aim low, when we want
these kids to aim high?"

Program coordinators and volun-
teers do agree that the mostimponant
aspect of the program is simply being
there on a regular basis.

“I hope the kids are getting some
sortaf stability and an understanding
that there are people who love them
unconditionally," said Goodman.“It’s
a commitment,” she asserted, “but
these kids deserve continuity. There
are enough people who come in and
out of their lives.”
