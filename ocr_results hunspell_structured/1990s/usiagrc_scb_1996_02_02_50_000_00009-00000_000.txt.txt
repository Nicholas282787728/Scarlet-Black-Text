The Grinnell College women's

end’s Grinnell Invitational is an in—
dicator ofthings to come, dreams of
a late—season burst have come true.
By racking up 455 points, the Pio-
necrs finished second only to Au—
gustana (6655 points), one of the
top Division lll swimming programs
in the nation. Luther was thirdWith
438 5 points.

In contrast to the world outside
the pool which was halted by a bliz—
zard, the Pioneers sped through the
waterwith some oftheirbesttimesof
theseason. "weswom great," lauded
Coach Erin Hurley. “It was not only
good conditioning, but also smart
swimming which led to our good
finishes. We started to use our train—
ing and it really showed”

Several Grinnell swimmers fin—
ished in the top three of their events
to earn critical points for the team.
One of these top performers was
Morgan Cheshire who placed sec—
ond in the 200 backstroke with a
nine of2:22.25 Finishing right be—
hind Chcshirc was teammate Chris—
tina Ward (2:2255) who also took
third—place honors in the 200 ﬂy
(2:29 71). Also, Emily Hewitt was
second in the 200 breaststroke in
2:46.17. Sonya Cooley was second
in the 3M diving. Finally, Melanie
Wyder was third in both the 500 free
and the 400 individual medleys.

Although the top—three finish—
ers carried the brunt of the scoring
load, Coach Hurley was most im.
pressed by the emergence of other
swimmers She especially pointed to
improvements by Rachel Erlich and
Susan Rogan in the distance and

and three relays He set season—best
times by finishingsecond in both the
100 and 200 breaststroke with times
of 1:08.13 and 2:28.92 Hutchison

ual medley in a time of 4:49.58 and
placed fifth in the 200 IM

rounded out the veteran performanc—
es with a third—place swim in the 500
free in 5:349.

Two rookies, Jeremy Lindquisl
and Matt Welch, made impacts for
the team in their specialties.
Lindquist went 550.7 to place sec—
ond in the 500 free and 19:00.6 for
second in the 1650. Welch, who is a
senior diving for the first time in

This Saturday the Pioneers are
looking for a repeat showing at the
Iowa College State Meet hosted by
Luther. ”Since Luther edged us at
our invitational, I think they‘ll be
the team to beat Saturday," noted
Hurley. “Also, the Naise are the
defending champions and are swim—
ming in their home pool."

“This weekend is very impot—
rant for us," said Hurley, “This is the
final tune—up before the conference
meet. Most of out swimmers still
have to determine their third events.
Hopefully this weekend will help
solidify the lineup. Right now we
need work on the technical side of
swimming so that Will be our focus,"
she concluded.
