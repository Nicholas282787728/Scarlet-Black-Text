NE hundred Quad girls
marched r l r to the men’s
dining room last night,

anticipating all kinds of thrills. . . .

Butalas! Instead of having to
struggle for room at a table. tltey
were conducted to a place, and the
young men came in very calmly.
Cream was passed in a civilized.
yes even tlte usual way; non [sic]
one yelled “Gimme thebread,” and
they had mashed potatoes. The
chaperones ate in peace and appar-
ently were quite at ease.

The girls had expected some-

The reportconcludcs: “While
we cannot eradicate disrespect-
ful, intimidating, or threatening
behavior between individuals,
there are a number of measures
that can be taken using existing
resources in Grinnell that we be-
lieve could reduce the incidents
of such behavior. This requires
that community leaders acknowlr
edge the importance of this issue
and continue to offer opportuni—
ties for public discussion. We
must make a long-term commit-
ment to continue the effort to
respond to the problems of ha-
rassment and intolerance and not
be discouraged by the realization
that this complex problem does
not have an easy solution."
