HIS year‘s annual spring con—
cert by Grinnell‘s Dance
Troupe promises to be excep-

tional. according to dance instructor
B. G. Voertman,

The concerL performed tonight
and tomorrow at 8:00 pm. in Roberts
Theatre, will be the last directed by
Voenman, who announced her redre-
ment last week. Voertman has been
teachingdanoeatGrinnellfor35years.

“Principally this concert is spe—
cial because it truly reﬂects creative
student work." Voertman said. The
program includes dancing and chore-
ography by dance troupe members,
combined with elaborate lighting and
costume design.

Every memberofthedance troupe
played a role in choreographing at
leastoneof the dances. Thereare also
two dances choreographed by
Voertman: a group piece, and a solo
danced by Voertman herself.

Piecesrange from lightand funto
thoughtful and philosophical, accord-
ing to Voenrnan. She hopes that the
audience will be impressed by the
contrasts and variety of music and
choreographic ideas. Voertman ex-
plained that she has encouraged a
diversity of approach, saying, “Ev-
erybody brings something very dif-
ferent to tile group and makes itncher
because they don’t all have to be
alike."

members, according to senior Kara
Bakken. Amember of theTroupc for
four years. Bakken said that dancing
is especially rewarding in perfor-
mance. “We get to do something we
love all the time—and then we get to
share it," she said.

Third-year Troupe member
Sheyma Saiyid expects people to be
surprised by the creativity that they
see, and estimates that Troupe mem
bers have been practicing ﬁfty hours
per week to prepare for the concert.
“In Ute three years I’ve been here, I
thinkpeoplehave worked the hardest
this year," she said.

For junior Colleen Thomas, a
member of the Dance Troupe for one
year, the concert is an opportunity to
see a different side ofcampus. “You

ground thingAliterally,“ she said.

First-year Troupe member
Chelsea Smock called the dancccon-
cert “a really different experience
from other theatre productions."
Dance is unique, she said. “because
all communication is through ac-

concert is just incredibly profes-
sional."

Technical Support

Though much of that work has
been undertaken by choreographers
and dancers,the concert wouldnotbc
complete without artistic contribu-
tions from designersand technicians.
“Theatre is the most collaborative of
all the arts, and I think dance is the
most collaborative of all the theatre
arts,” Voertman said.

Costumes for this year‘s conccn
were designed by professional de-
signer Kaiome Malloy, and created
by acrew often students. In the week
between the arrival of the material
and the first dress rehearsal, work

continued twelve hours aday to com
plete the 77 costumes in the concert,
43 of which had to be built from
scratch. To improvecfflcicncy in the
costume shop, the sewing machines
were given names such as Lolita,
Stuart and Clifford.

Lighting designs were created
by three students and three faculty
members. SeniorSheaNanglccttlled
