B24 veterans probe plane’s past

Harvey Quindt
By JOHN BREEMER

News/opinion edllal

For a retired Grinnell master ser-
geant who served as a tail gunner on a
B 24 bomber during World War II, the
Internet has proved to be a rich lode of
lore — and more current developments
— regarding the legendary aircraft.

Harvey Quindt, 74, and fellow Grin-
nell veteran Jack Templeton discov-
cred a website on the Internet this
spring that includes a Ba24 “guest
book."

The Internet B-24 Veterans Group
created the website to make available
“a glimpse back in history" regarding
the B-24 Liberator. The home page
notes that the plane “was produced in

greater quantities and ﬂown in more
theaters of war by the air rorces of
more countries than any other foulr
engine bonibei in World War 11

Templeton and Quindt, of course,
had more than a little interest in cotnr
multicating wrih others who had ﬂown
the bombers. Qumdt signed the “guest
book" without hesttﬂilon,

Ermail correspondence

“[fyou want to sign it, you put yotir
name antlermailaddressonit,"Qulndt
said. “I did, and shortly thereafter 1
started getting e-mail from a fellow in
Gemiany. He wanted to know about
the 8‘24, and l sent him infonnation."

The German, it turned out, was der
ing some digging —— physical digging
~ With a professor of archaeology,
trying to locate a 1324 that had been
shot down near Hannover by a young
German lieutenant on May 14, 1944.

Thirty-six—year—oldEnncoSchwartz
has corresponded with both Quindt
and Templeton regarding the attempt

wrote to Templeton:

“Please understand that even if we

ts certainly no plane wreckage to re-

what used to be a 13-24. It is, ofcourse,
possible to recover maybethe engines,
but this is not our main interest.

apparently sat on the wrong side ofthe

How to explain their more seem-1y

To the editor:

on Monday, Sept. 14, l resigned as
Ppweshiek County corchair of the
Democratic Party. Before you make
any assumptions as to the reasons, let
me explain. I see this year as a great
opportunity for the Democrats, anti 1
was willing to risk 20 percent of our
larger-than—ever bank accountto spen-
sor a rally and fundraiser for David
Osterberg and Tom Vilsaek, both of
whom visited our community this
spring, along wtth Leonard Boswell,
to help us raise money.

Initially my plans were approved
and the arrangements were made, but
then some of our inﬂuential members,
fearing that time was too short, can-
celed theplans while I was out oftown
at a Wedding. Since my leadership had
not been persuasive, I decided it best
that I resign. I will continue to serve as
a county central committee member
and will work hard to elect Democrats
in November.

This community needs better access
to affordable health care, protection
for our environment. continuing sup-
port ofpublic education and a restora-
tion of tax fairness. (It was reported
today that the rich in Iowa pay an
average of7 percent in Iowa income
tax, a family With $32,000 in income
pays 10 percent and a poor family can
pay I 1 percent.) Iowa has the fastest-
growing spread in income between the
rich and the poor of any state in the
nation,withtherich makinghuge gains
andthemtddleand poorincome groups
losing ground.

This community needs protection
for our economy from the predatory
practicesof large and international cor-
porations. Corporate agriculture has
taken the chicken industry. Chickens
used to be a safe and inexpensive source
ofprotein.Corporateagricultureistak—
ing the hog industry. Pork used to be a
safe and inexpensive meat. Pollution
and disease are now threatening both
industries, causing corporate producers
to inject antibiotics into the drinking
Water to keep the animals healthy
enough to market. Antibiotioresistant
diseases are a real threat to our health.
Antibiotics in livestock Water is being
banned in Denmark because'of the
danger it creates to human health.

The local Democratic Party orga-
nization is the lever by which ordinary
people effect the course of the govem—
ment. We need political ﬁnance re»
form to get big money out of politics,
and We can only do it if we control the
local partyorganizationsand electcan-
didates whewillsupportus.Big money
and the richown the Republican Party,

, land they have far too much to say in the

Democratic Party. I urge you to get
active in the party, because together
We can make a difference. Our current
president succeeded partly because he
was the favorite of big money and the
rich—JohnSherman,formerchair,
