: Jungle Fever explores
:haunting urban reality

‘ By Peter Beresford Reed

Jungle Fevcris Spike Lee’s ambi-
v tious ﬁlm about a plethora of issues
. which plague the urban black com-
munity in particular, and American
> society in general. Speciﬁcally, Lee
( addressesintenacialrelationships,the
animosity between urban blacks and
’ Italian-Americans, drug addiction,
4 religious fanaticism, and more.
This ﬁlm stars Wesley Snipes as
' Flipper Purify. a middle-class black
> architect, and Annabella Sciona as
. tlte working—class Italian-American
secretary with whom he becomes roe
' manticallyinvolvetl. I-Iisperfonnance
‘ is good. but hers is magical. The rest
of the cast is equally outstanding.
' Lee's critics often lament his in-

ability, or unwillingness. to unequivo~
cally articulate his solution(s) to the
questions he raises. The issues he
raises have no deﬁniteanswers, how-
ever, and his aim is to raise con-
sciousness, not to provide a guide for
the improvement of society. The is-
sues he raises are profound and every
individual owesitto herorhimself to
see this movie more tltan once to
thoroughlyappreciateitsmanysubtle-
ties.

Jungle Fever is Spike Lee’s best
ﬁlm so far. Many people found it
disturbing. It is supposed to be. It is
real and it is haunting, and to dismiss
it is to dismiss a real and haunting
realityt Jungle Fever will be shown
tonightat7:30,andon Sunday a13:00
pm in the Harris Cinema.

The only cool thing about rela-

Fast Times at Ridgemont High

Fart Timer affords its viewers an intricately realistic (if somewhat exaggerated) glimpse of what it was
like to be a middle-class teenager in Southem California in the early 1980’s From the Pat Benatar
lookalikcsin the RidgemontHigh hallways to the rules of dating(besure tohaveLedZeppelian playing
on the tape deck), Fart Time: reﬂects and gives non-judgemental credibility to teen subculture. and
speaks to high-school»age angst better than any other ﬁlm except Rebel Without a Cause. Sean Penn
justly deserves all the attention he has received for his spaced-out, always-stoned Jeff Spicoli character.
Fart Time: at Ridgemont High will be shown on Friday, Nov. 29, at 8:30 pm. in Nortll Lounge.

the Broadway version was written

Hair tells the story of what hap-

pens whem the straightelaced, farm
boy Claude. who has a few days to
kill before he is shipped to Vietnam,
meets and spends time with aband of
New York hippies.

This ﬁlm is a tune-packed, and
wonderfully choreographed adapta-
tion of a Broadway musical that was
once shocking, but is now merely
lots of fun Hair will be shown next
Thursday at 8:30 in Nonh Lounge.
