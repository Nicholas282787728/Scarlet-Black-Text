Student Government Election Run-Off Today

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Contributing Writer

Over a week of posters, debates and
interviews will come to an end today in
the run»off election for Student Govern-
ment Association [SGA] President and
Vice President] President of Academic
Affairs

Petar Klaetsch '99 and Elina Koretsky
'99 are facing off in the race for Presi-
dent, while Jessrca Dvorak ’99 and
Indhira LaPuma ‘00 are the run-off can-
didates for VP/PAA.

The run»off election will take place
from 9am to 4pm today in the post ofﬁce.

Though the campaigns'were short
compared to last year’s publicity mara-
thon, student interest in elections seems
to have risen. Only 75 percent of students
cast ballots in the ﬁrst election last year.
This year, 82 percent voted, Last year’s
turnout prompted a run»off election be»
cause none of the candidates initially re
ceived more than 50 percent of the vote,
and similarly, this year‘s elections were
closely contested.

Evaluating the speed of the campaigns,
current SGA president Erin Childress ‘98

said, “A really long
campaign is notncc-
essarily better than a
short one. . . . [Last
year], there wasn’t a
really huge turnout
at every event,”
While last year’s
candidates appeared
at numerous locales
including Bob‘s.
KDIC. town. and
various residence
halls, this year's six
presidential and
viccrpresidenlial
candidates appeared
at only two major
events together:

Real World Experience

CDO helps students find summer jobs

BY RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

The Career Development Office
[CDO] has the resources and staff to as-
sist students interested in summer jobs and
internships.

These programs “allow students to do
something they couldn‘t do during the
[academic school] year," said Director Of
the Career Development Office Steve
Langerud. '

Langerud sees such programs as intem-
ships and research as giving students a
chance to “use the skills they’ve learned
in the classroom" in a different environ-
ment, whether that be in another city or
another country.

On~campus research is also an option
for students who wish to remain in
Grinnell over the summer. “It is a pivotal
experience for students," Langerud ex,
plained, "because it gives them a chance
to ask themselves, ‘do I want to do this
or not?‘ "

Another opportunity for students is to
take part in collegefunded summer in-
ternships. Selected students generally re-
ceive a stipend to pay for living expenses
in addition to four academic credits,

Nike Papadopoulos ‘98 received a
“Community Development Grant" to
work in Chicago during the summer of
1997. The Pilsen Resurrection Project
works with the Latino children of recent
immigrants to the US. Through it,
Papadopoulos worked With the children

of mothers living in a battered women’s
shelter. She directed a summer camp for
them which provided various activities
including story writing and ﬁeld trips.

”I wanted to do community develop—
ment work and work with Latino immi—
grants," PapadOpOulos explained. “Steve
[Langerud] told me about a Coma“ alum'
working in the organizatio ..it all went
from there."

In addition to funded internships, ad—
ditional summer opportunities for stu»
dents include more typical summerjobs,
some of which may relate to educational
goals.

“We see the value of such programs
when students come back and talk about
the significance of their experiences.“
Langerud mentioned.

Jessica Kimelman ‘98 was one of
seven students who took part in an intern-
ship last summer in Lesotho in Southern
Africa. There she taught a special program
at an all»girls high school,

The program was organized by Profes—
sor of History George Drake as part of
the Hewlett Grant Internship Program.
Kimelman said.

“Going to Lesotho changed my life.”
she continued. “Now I hope to teach af-
ter I graduate, hopefully back at St.
Rodruige [in Lesotho]."

Senior Sarah Fowles spent the summer
of 1997 interning with a public arts orga-
nization in Manhattan known as Creative
Time. Fowles did work involving the pre—

swer session and the debate included adv
herence to Grinnell’s core values, com—
munication with the trustees, and
multiculturalism. Also discussed were the

qualiﬁcations of individual candidates.

Concerning the issues, some students
saw a likeness between the stances Ofthe
various candidates. Erin Drehobl ‘99
said, “I felt they said the same thing about
the lssues..,about multiculturalism and
dialogue."

Caroline Lowry ‘00 agreed: “Every
one seemed like they were going for the
same things."

Reﬂecting on the task of differential»
ing oneself from other candidates.
Childress said, “I felt that way last year—
that you want to feel original. But [while
there may not be original problems] there
are Original ways of dealing with prob-
lems."

Some students also saw a likeness not
only between candidates, but between is-
sues from year to year. Christopher Tho-
mas ‘00 noted that each year, candidates
seem to be “kicking around the same
issues....l don't know what else there is
to do with multicultural space. I don‘t
know that if we elect one candidate or
another it’ll get done faster,"

Dave Bradley ‘01 agreed. “All they

‘The revolution we must pursue’
NOW VP promotes grassroots activism

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Elizabeth Toledo, Vice President Ofthe
National Organization for Women
(NOW), spoke at yesterday’s Scholars’
convocation. Speaking about feminism
and NOW‘s role in it, she encouraged a
grassroots approach and “everyday actsx
of rebellion" to assert feminism.

Toledo quoted Margaret Mead: “Never
doubt that a small group of committed
people can change the world. Indeed it is
the Only thing that ever has."

Toledo, the ﬁrst Latina to hold the po»
sition of Vice President, was previously
the first Latina President of the Califor-
nia chapter of NOW, where she organized
the chapter's most diverse board of direc-
tors. Toledo has worked extensively on
rallies and protests, as well as on lectures
to colleges and universities. Her Convo~
cation yesterday was in honor of Women’s
History Month.

Students and faculty alike were imr
pressed with Toledo’s speech yesterday.
Political Science professor Robert Grey
described it as an “inspiring talk [which]
reminds us ofthe power of grassroots or— _
ganizations. [It demonstrates] the people
refusmg to accept . . , limited agendas
from Washington. [It is] a necessary re-
minder."

In her speech. Toledo defined the role
ofzt feminist today, addressed issues fac-
ing feminism, and gave a history of femi—
nism and NOW’s role in it.

Elizabeth Toledo, the Vice
President ofNOW, delivered
convocation this Thursday.

Toledo deﬁned the role of a feminist
as “[pushing] not for change we are al-
lowed to pursue, but for the revolution
that we must pursue."

In order to pursue change. Toledo em-
phasized that feminists must have a
united front. Confronting an issue within
the feminist movement, she asked, “What
is the color of feminism?"

The changing face of feminism forces
people to ask themselves what the color
of feminism is. Whereas NOW has been
known as a traditionally ”white organi-
zation," the increasing interest ofminOti-
ties has forced it to evaluate itself. To-
ledo explained that the question asked by
