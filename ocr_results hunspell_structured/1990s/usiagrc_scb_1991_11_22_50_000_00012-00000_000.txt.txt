Women’s basketball explores rotations,
offensive patterns in Beloit scrimmage

By Alex Severens

The 1991 Grinnell women‘s bas-
ketball team got their ﬁrst taste of
competition over the weekend in a
scrimmage against Beloit college, a
Northern Division team. This year
the Pioneers will be harder to predict
without the pre sence of All-Ameri-
canMissy Sharer, and the early scrim-
mage gave Coach Eskildsen an op—
portunity to see what the team could
do

Eskildsen was both “pleased and
surprised" as he watched Grinnell
strongly compete against the talented
Beloit learnt Grinnell led by six at the
half, but eventually lost by four to a
Beliot team which sported ﬁve re-
turners and threeall-conference play-
ers.
Scrimmages can be used to ﬁnd

weakness in a team. and Eskildsen
discovered that. “we'll need to ﬁnd
better rotations, in terms of playing
time. We'll be doing a lot of suhsLiA
tuting this year. “ He added that some
players who had gone in for short
shifts last year will need to adjust to
longer playing time this year,

“Rightnow we might not have the
depth that we had last year, but in the
long ntn we” 11 have good depth. We’re
stillin the developmental stages now,
but this group's progress is ahead of
last year’s group, These players have
tremendous work habits and they will
bring cnergyintothegym,”Eskildsen
added.

Besides finding the perfect rota—
tion, the team will have to find a new
pattern of scoring.“Balanced scoring
will be essential for us." Eskildsen
said. “We’ve changed the offense a

littlebittofacilitateabalancc,and we
will need people who did not score
much last year to step up and provide
points, I’d like to see four or ﬁve
players in double ﬁgures each night.“

The women will begin defending
their Midwest Conference title Fri?

Freeman was not unhappy with‘
how her team ran, and pointed out.
that the race was not only a culmina-
tion ofa ﬁne season. but a reason to'
look forward to next yearr .

“The most impressive thing in thek
race for us was how well we ran as a
team. Our top ﬁve were in the topvr
seventy. When you consider we only‘
had one senior who ran and three
freshmen, it looks pretty good for‘
next year." A

Freeman said that the softrtess andA
extensive length of the coursemade it
difﬁcult for the team to run its best‘
times. ‘

Beach added, “It went fine. It was
respectable in a kind of mediocre‘
way The whole season was great and 4
this meet was respectable because it
was a strong finish for the last race of ‘
the season.” :

Freeman stated that the positive<
outlook for next year‘s team is di»
