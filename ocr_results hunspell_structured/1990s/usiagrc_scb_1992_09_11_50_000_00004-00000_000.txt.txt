National Debt — Our greatest crisis

by Evan L. Reid

ManyAmericansarefamiliarwith
the cultural legacies of the World
War II era and the Baby Boom gen-
eration tltat have preceded our own
“twenty-something" generation.
Cold warriors like George Bush find
a cultural touchstone in grainy pic-
tures of J ohn‘ Wayne on the sands of
Iwo Jima. The numerically overr
whelming baby boomers, whose
ranks include Bill Clinton, ﬂood the
airwaves with the music and televi—
sion of their youth.

Whatever you think of theirmusic
and movies, our parents and grand-
parents are leaving us with a far more
important inheritance. It is growing
larger every day, choking our best
efforts to revive the economy and
make choices about our Nation‘s fu-
ture. Economists, now in rare agree-
ment believe that this legacy, our $3
trillion federal debt, may seriously
reduce the next generation’s stan-
dard of living.

The debt, the sum total of the
yearly federal budget deﬁcits, accur
mulates at an astonishing pace.
$11,574 a minute, $1 billion a day,
according to statistics compiled by
the Ofﬁce of Management and Bud—
get. The debt is equivalent to more
than one-half of all the goods and
sewicespmduced in theUnited States
lastyear. The govemmentmustspend
15% of its budget each year on inter
est payments to service this enor-
mous debt.

From any perspective of the po-
litical spectrum, left, right, or center,
this 15% is perceived to be money
taken at the expense of other, press-
ing national concerns. Some would
like that 15% to feed. clothe, and
house needy Americans. Others feel
tltat the 15% could be returned to the

American taxpayer for investment
that might create needed jobs and
industries. More immediately, the
15% of the budget locked into inter-
est payments has dramatically re-
duced the federal govcmment’s abil-
ity to respond to lingering economic
dislocation in tlte wake of the recent
recession.

Simplyput,thisdebtand lhemulti-
billion dollar deﬁcits that feed itev-
cry yearareloweringAmetica’s start»
dard of living. When politicians say
that the “twenry»something” generate
tion will be the first generation un-
able to surpass the prosperity of the
previous generation. they aren‘t nec-
essarily seeking cheap votes. They
are,saysRichardRippe,chiefecono-
mistomedetitialSecurities,entirely
correct.

Rippe, quoted in a recent New
York Times article, states “Because
investment affects productivity,
growth and, hence, standard of liv-
ing, the U.S. is inadvertently choos-
ing a less competitive and less pros-
perous economy than it needs to.”

"l'heCongressionalBudgetOfﬁce,
with remarkable candor, remarked
two years ago that “the deﬁcit is
likely to exceed $200 billion dollars
(annually) for the foreseeable
future...deﬁcits of those magnitudes
cripple economic growth." ,

Economists,theWhiteHouse,and
Congress all seem to be in agree»
merit. The debt is destroying our
ability to create new jobs, they say.
So what is being done to combat the
debt and eliminate the yearly deft-
cits? As of November, 1990, abso-
lutely nothing. Tile much-heralded
“Budget Summit” of 1990 promised
to reduce the federal budget deﬁcit
from an anticipated $336 billion in
1993 to $189 billion in 1996. By
1997, however, the deﬁcits are ex-

 

problems including:

pected to return to a sharp upward
trajectory. The government, for the
first time ever, has no announced
plans to return the U. S. to the black.

The budget summiteers, while
agreeing on these modest deficit $-
duction goals, endcd the Gramm
Rudman Act’s attempts to eliminate
the deficits and begin whittltng away
at the federal debt. With no plan to
battle the debt, it has become more
likely that a final solution lies de-
cadesinthefuture. Thecurrentguard-
ions of the Republic, far from laying
new plans to tackle the debt are plot-
ting strategies that will vastly in«
crease it. George Bush recently pro-
posed across-the-board tax cuts that
are only partially met by decreases in
govemmentspending. BillClinton‘s
announceddeﬁcitreductionblueprint
will save only a few billion dollars
morethantheadministration’spolicy.

if no vision can bediscemed in the
present leadership, what does the fu-
ture hold for the country? The re-
sponsibility for ending deficitspettd-
ing and eliminating the debt, and the
cxcruciatingly painful choices that
must be made to successfully do that,
will have to be undertaken by the
next generation of leaders. Other-
wise, the tlcbt will render the federal
government unable to accomplish
anything at all. We will pay hunr
dreds of thousands of dollars in taxes
during our lives and receive only a

few thousand dollars in beneﬁts. The
remainder will go solely to pay the
interest on the debt.

The solutions open to potential
deficit-cutters are certain to enrage
the standard-bearers of the right and
the left. In order to arrest the growth
ofthedebt,thcgovemmentmustﬁrst
balance the federal budget. This
simple premise was the cornerstone
of former Senator Paul Tsongas’ sur»
prism gly lon g-lived presidential carn-
paign. The people, Tsongas said, are
ready to hear his call to lay aside the
dogmatism of both liberals and con»
servatives in order to concentrate
upon eliminating the deﬁcit. Taxes
will have to be taised, sharply. Gov—
emment spending will have to be
slashed, deeply, Tsongas said. An
entire herd of sacred cows will have
to go to slaughter. Tsongas even
hinted that the most sacred of sacred
cows, Social Security, might have to
be reexamined.

Tsongas (D-Massachusetts), and
his new associate, retiring Senator
Warren Rudman (RrNew Hamp-
shire), are finding a national base of
pragmatiststosupporttheirviews. A
new group has sprung up to urge
candidates for Congress to sign a
deficitreduction pledge, This pledge
binds the prospective representative
or senator to retire after four or six
years if the def' ' ’s not reduced by
half. In Iowa. U.S. Representative

Jim Nussle (R-Manchester) has al-
ready laken the pledge in his tough
rcclcction campaign.

At some point, these choices will
have to be made, The debt is an
abstract, Creeping giant, illrsulled to
capturing theattenlionorunderstand-
ing of our sound bite society. The
burden of confronting the debt and
the practices that created it lies in-
creasingly upon the shoulders of the
younger generation. They must de-
cideiftheywillcompcltoday’spoli-
ticians to address this colossal prob-
lem, orifthey alone will shouldcrthe
pain and the price of continued pro-
crastination.

Nationalized health care, the cur-
rentcattse celebre of American liber-
als, will remain adreatn with the debt
at its current level, Experts have
concluded that tax hikes will be in-
evitable if the deficit situation per-
sists, a suggestion that shocks con-
servatives. Thehighway system may
have to be converted to tollways and
somehavespcculatcdthatthefederal
college loan program to middle class
students is also in serious jeopardy.
Despite these predictions, the
“twcnty-somcthings" are largely
unmotivated as a political force.
Should theirapathy continue, their is
no guarantee that today’s politicians
will ever seriously attempt to lift the
specterofdebtsand deficits thatcloud
our Nation’s economic future,

The search continues

by Kendra Ford

The search continues for the
people responsible for the killing of
Tammy Zywicki. According to RA
Rina Patrick, the police chief on the
casein Illinois isvery impressed with
Lhe publicity that Grinncll students
have generated conceming Tammy’s
case. The Illinois State Police have
received hundreds of Calls about the
truck pictured on the posters and they
are following up every plausible lead.
Thepolice encourage students tocon-
tinuepostingﬂyersandtotrytocover
areas which have not received as
much coverage. Effons are being co-
ordinated to post updated flyers (with
pictures of the truck and other infor-
mation concerning the case) in Mis-
souri, especially along the routes she
might have been taken on from Illi-
nois, through Iowa and Missouri.
There are also plans to distribute ﬂy-

eis at the entrance to the parking
concourse at the U2 concert on Fri-
day. Anyone able or willing to drive
to Missouri or to the concert to post
flycrs should contact RAs Rina
Patrick or Janice Gerda or tell
[TAMMY] to contact the Search for
Tammy Committee.

Onc further unfortunate reality of
the Search is the need for funding.
Students on the ﬁnance commiltce
for the search said, unofﬁcially, that
some $2000 had been raised between
theStateStreetStation cvening.FOG
Fast, and the restaurants in town co-
operating with FOG Fast. Many sore
vices, such as xeroxing and enve-
lopes, were donated by Grinnell Col-
lege but postage bills which run into
the hundreds, if not over a thousand
dollars, must be paid, President
Ferguson offered to pay for postage
but since the bill is so large further
fundingisncerlcd.Muchoflhemoney

which is raised will go to the Zywicki
fatnily to help to offsetthe thousands
of dollars they spent in the search and
on funeral services So, studcntscon-
tinueto try to raise money. One fund
raising event is the Run-A»Thon,
which will take place Ihis Saturday.
The cross country teams are getting
sponsors for a nine mile run to Rock
Creek. Several runners have reported
receiving over a hundred dollars in
pledges so they expect that the event
will be highly successful. Other fund
raising events are likely to be schedr
tiled. Students should stay alert for
posters concemin g the search and
fund raising evens.

Janice Gerda repons that there is
a meeting or workshop tentatively
planned for Wednesday eveningwith
a specially trained counselor. Janice
has contacted a counselor who is
specially trained to help people who
were close to a victim of a violent
death. Students should also remain
