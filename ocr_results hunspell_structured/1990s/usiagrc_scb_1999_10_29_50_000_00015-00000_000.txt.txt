Fran Lee ’00 was worried that
she would come olt boring in an
article.

“I wish i could tell you some.
thing that was really interesting or
something that would make me
sound like not such a boring per-
son," shesaid at a recent interview.
“But it’s hard to get involved with
other things here with both sports
and school,"

Lee has
little to worry
about though.
A striker on
the confer»
cncedeadlng
women's SOCV
cer team, Lee’s
leadership of?
the field and play on it speaks for
itself.

Borh Lee‘s leadership and socr
ctr skills have had plenty of time
to develop. The l>ortland native has
been playing soecer since she was
six. She said there was little quest
tion that she would end up in the
sport as “everyone" in her family
plays soeeer.

Despite her long career in soc»
cet, Lee said she almost didn’t play
at Grinnell.

”I thought about not playing
in college,” Lee said, “burl drink
that playing herewas probably one
of the best decisions l'vt every
made, it just changed my whole
college experience."

This soccer season plays a large
part in Lee's contentment with her
decision to play. The Pioneers are
the top seed in this weekend’s Mid—
west Conference tournament and
will host the event.

“This has been the best season
since I've been here—I’m having
so much fun," Lee said. “It’s ev-
erything you could ask for in your
senior season, l wish 1 could stay

Lee ready to take
MWC soccer title

and play another year "

Lee is conﬁdent that her 5:»
niorsoccerscason will end on the
same high note it earned through»
out the year. she said she expects
her team to win the MWC cham-
pionshipiand the automatic
berth into the NCAA national
tournament that goes with it.

“I deﬁnitely think we're going
to win [canfctencc],” Lee said.
“We deﬁnitely have the talent and
everybody wants it: the desire’s
there.”

Lee said that a large part otrhe
team's talent mis year has come
from the outstanding unity the
Pioneers have shown throughout
the season.

_ “We madea goal at the beginr
ning of the season that we were
going to play like sisters and get
along that well and be that close
to each other,” Lee said. “I think
we’ve really done that."

Although Lee said she has enr
joyed the sisterhood ofthc team,
she added she enjoys playing soc—
cer for another reason entirely. “it
makes mereel tough to push
people around and get pushed
aroundx’she said.

Lee’s life off the ﬁeld is not
nearly so aggressive; she said she
enjoy: reading and hiking at
home, but finds Grinncll he
leaves little time for either hobby
during the school year.

instead, Lee said, she concen.
trates on her biology malot dur
ing the academic year. originally
a history major, Lee said she
changed during after taking a bi.
ology class her sophomore year,

“Now I’m doubling up on sci.
encc classes and putting myself
mrough hell so i can graduate with
a biology major.” she said.

Lee said she is considering
graduate work in biology after
graduation but has not ruled out
the possibility ofmedical school.

Either way, Lee said she will
leave Grinnell, and especially the
women’s soccer (cam, with many
good mcmoties.

“I know that I’ve come away
with a lot of really good friends
and a lot ofreally good memories,"
concluded bee,

 

 

Pioneers pumped fo

Their team theme is, “Hard
work beats talent that doesn’t work
hard." or eourse, implicit in this
statement is the dtemc drat talent
that does work hard will beat just
plain hard work until it is black,
blue and only identiﬁable by its
dental recordst

If not physically beating other
teams to a bloody pulp, the hard
working and talent-saturated
Gtinnell women's soccer team has
made a lot ofothct teams just look
silly mis year. Their stats show it.
Their record shows it. They are the
clear standrout team in the Midwest
Conference.

But they remain reserved in
their statements. They should be
anything but.

Secondryear head coach
Heather Benning said, “we want
to play our strongest soeeer at the
end of the season.”

Forward Amy Walters ’01 said,
“I find discomfort in the statement
‘I expect to win.”

Other teams could find discom-
fort in this statement, but the Pin-
neers should not. They should ”ex,
peer to win. The team undeniably
has the most skilled players in the
conferencc and the most deput at
every position. Their high-pressure
defense and 43.3 setup have
turned games into shooting prac»
tice, averaging over four goals a
game,

They have the most proliﬁc
scorer in the nation, Walters, and
it just starts mere. Eleven of the
top thirtyscoters in the conference
suit up for Grinnell~each ream only
ﬁelds eleven at a time.

with a defense composed of a

combination of young and savvy
old talent, the team has allowed less
than a goal a game.

Clearly, as co-captain center
midﬁelder Sarah Dixon ‘01 says,
“We play beautiful two-touch soc-
eer, wc do a great job at high.pres.
sure defense and each ofout play-
ers is involved in both the defen-
sive and offensive aspects of our
game.”

All this and, according to
Walters, “our talent is matched with
an incomparable desire to succeed."

And, good team chemistry.
Elysia Hassebroek ’03 noted that
the team is extremely tight knit, and
is not likely to unwind, “I find
myself in awe every time we’re all
together."

An example l—lassebroek used
gives good reason for her to be in
awe of the nature of the team and
die mutual tespect teammates have.
Two playets, competing against
each other for a starting position,
cheered each other through a bad
practice day, she said. _

Benning doesn‘t know yet who
her starters will be, but, whoever

they are, they are the favotltcs of
the tournament.

“Right now we are on top and
everyone is gunning for us. When
you’re in that situation you have to
be mentally tough and prepare
properly," said Benning. '

The number two and three
seeds, St. Norbert and Lawrence,
will kick off the toutnarnent at 10
am. on Jane Springer Field. Top-
seeded Grinnell hosts the fourth
seed, Beloir, at 1 pm. The cham-
pionship game is Sunday at noon.

Earlier in the year the Pioneers
downed the Buccaneers, 1-0, in
Beloit. Grinnell’s only conference
blemish came at Lawrence in a 1-1
tie.The Pioneers posted a final regue
lateseason record of 12-2-1 and
were 3,0,1 in die conference.

Despite her discomfort at prer
dictions, Walters did say, “I have ex-
treme conﬁdence in this soccer
teams ability and potential. We set
high goals for ourselves in the be»
ginningotthe year and we have met
every one ofrhem thus far...and it
will not end here.” She is probably
right.
