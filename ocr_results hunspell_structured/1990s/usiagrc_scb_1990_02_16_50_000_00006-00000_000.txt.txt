Treat Domestic
Study Like Abroad

Monday is the academic offrcampus study application deadline.
Approximately 150 applications will be turrted in to fill the 150 spaces
reserved for students to study offcampus. But according to the Off-
Campus Studies Ofﬁce (OCS), notall applicants will be granted leave. of
the 150 who are approved, 100 will leave for the fall semester. and the rest
for the spring semester. Of the 100 students granted fallrscmester leave,
45 will participate in the Grinnell-in—London program.

Then there is the handful of students who applied to the OCS Board
with domestic-program proposals. The implication from OCS, though. is
that these proposals are less likely to be approved. J an Czechowski, OCS
director said thatacombination of an academic program including course
work speciﬁwa involved with the location of the program , plus emersion
in a foreign culture are critical elements of an OCS program. Czechowski
maintains that some students are not favored over others, but that “a
question arises as to the matter of imponance of a cross-cultural nature,
what the proposed academic program is, and how they mix."

The beneﬁts for a foreign language major, or for a student who wishes
to pursue a career in international relations or to work overseas are
obvious. Equally obvious, though, are the benefits that would befall a
political science major studying in Washington, DC. or an art major
studying at the Art Institute of Chicago. 30 the question is, how and why
does the OCS Board justify that aFrench major's OCS program is “more
imponant“ than another surdent's proposed domestic program?

Domestic programs may offer just as much opportunity for cultural
expansion and supplementarion of a liberal education to a student as an
overseas program. Grinnell, Iowa cannot offer the same cultural or hands-
on experience that domestic program proposals seek. And it is improper
to force a student to learn a foreign language and gain practical experience
overseas. when the opportunities lie within the US

Hopefully, the OCS Board will realize the f‘malter of imponance”
surrounding domestic programs, and will take into account the experi-
ences to be obtained through them. That way, they will be able to do their
job—without it becoming “a question of favor." .

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR,

Celebration for '
Mandela's Release

To the editor.

It was a brisk morning with the
temperature probably in the 20’s.
The time wasabout6150 am, quite
an unusual time to be up and riding
in a car in Grinnell, especially after
staying up partying until 4 am. the
night before.

But, for the four of us driving to
Tokwa's house that morning, the
day, Sunday. Feb. 11, was too
imponant a day to be asleep, For,
this was a day that we, only maybe,
dreamt would come to pass in our
life time; this was a day that
thousands of people had died for, it
was aday that will mark thelivm of
the African people forever.

What was so special about
Sunday. Feb. 11. 1990, you ask? A

straightforward response is that
Nelson Mandela, the jailed leader
of the African National Congress,
one of the greatest leaders of all
times, was being released from
prison, and we, the people driving
in that car that morning were going
to make it so that we saw, in the
words of Hugh Masekela. “withour
owneycs,”ourleaderwa1king“hand
in hand with Winnie Mandela...,"
out of prison into freedom.

But, most signiﬁcant is the
concept associated with the release
of Mandela. Freedom for Mandela
signiﬁed freedom (or me eminence
of) for the blacks of South Africa,
for the African people and, do [dare
say, for oppressed people around

McDonald Must Recant
Invasion Support

To the editor:

Most of us felt either relief or
outrage over Bush’s invasion of
Panama last December. Undoubtr
edly it came as a surprise to almost
all of us. Iowans, however, were
treated to an additional, rather uni
pleasant surprise...

Ambassador John W, McDonald
is currently president of the Iowa
Peace Institute here in Grinnell.
According to a Peace Center bro-
chure. “McDonald has 40 years of
diplomatic service with the U.S.
government and wide international

experience." It goes on to say that
“Under his leadership, the Institute
will contribute to international peace
through research. education. uain-
ing, and information services.”
Funny. “Peace through strength”
isn‘t mentioned. “Peace through
the violent resolution of a conflict
which left 24 US. citizens and at
leastAOO (probably closer to 6,000)
Panamanian civilians dcud" isn‘t
mentioned.

Soon after the invasion of Pan
ama, Ambassador McDonald came

Extend
3-2 to
Admissions

To the editor,

The Feb. 9 edition of the Scarlet
and Black featured an article
concerning overcrowding in
classes due to the 3-2 program.
In order to alleviate this condition,
we propose the following
3-2 admissions progam. Out of
every three-year period. only
two freshmen classes will be
admitted to Grinnell College.

This program would reduce
the number of students on
campus, thereby allowing for
smaller classes. Thus, we could
retain the 3-2 teaching program
and reduce class sizes
simultaneously.

This program would alleviate
student dissatisfaction over
insufficient quantity and
diversity of courses offered. By
eliminating the need for freshmen
tutorials in off years. professors
will be free to teach more
special topics and advanced
seminars.

Pro—Life Group Seeks Middle Ground

To the editor.

The recent campus memo
concerning a prorlifc organization
has generated both a positive and
negative response. Although the
memo was written by another
person, I feel I should apologize for
the offense itcaused since so many
people have assumed I share the
opinions expressed in the memo. I
do not, nor do the sentiments reﬂect
the focus of the organization. The
intended purpose is to serve more as
a pro-life support group rather than
as a political movement. As several
other pcoplc have commented,such
a group is needed on campus to
represent those people who are pro-
life or leaning in that direction. It
has been unfortunate that those in
the minority or in thegrcy area have
so far been represented only by an
aggressive few who cannot appeal
to mostpcoplc. Thcimportantpoint

Iwishtosuess is thatthis group has
not been created for debating or to
cause controversy: it is simply a
support group. Equal consideration
must be given to both the majority
and thcminority opinions on campus

and hopefully the abortion issue
can be handled with more tolerance
on both sides. Anyone interested in
discussing this is more than
welcome to contact me.

Eurocentrisrn No Answer to
Multicultural Dilemma

To the editor,

I just want to express my
appreciation to the planners of this
year’s Civil Rights Symposium. It
was extraordinarily provocative,
and the events were unusually well-
attended Some of Linda Chavez’s
points made me want to wail and
some of Harry Edwards’s points
mademewanttohangmy head,but
this is a good thing. The speakers
mudemcquestionthcfoundationof
my beliefs and those beliefs are

more solid for the ordeal. Certain
columnists for the Scarlet andBIac/c
should only be so articul to and
wellrresearched when they attempt
the same feat.

To take up just one ofChaveZ‘s
points, I was intrigued by her
response to a statement by Alanna
Tyler, She said that Tyler. as an
African-American, had more in
common with herself, a Mexican
American, than with her African
