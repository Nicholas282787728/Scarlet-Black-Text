Iowa’s future means
more than a new slogan

There’s been a lot or discussion about rcplacmg lowa‘s timcrwom slogan
with something a bit mOI‘C inspiring Shortly uftcr he took ofﬁce, Gov. Tom
Vilsack expressed some scorn for the current slogan, “lowa, You Make Me
Smile," and people immediately began oitcring suggestions for a new one.

Now, the govci nor has announced plans for somctliinghc's dubbed
“Iowa 2010. An Essay Contest for High School Seniors." The idea is to
encourage students from throughout the state to help pick a new slogan ——
and. more iiitportirntly, to offer some concrete thoughts about the way lowa
ought to look in 20m

Students Will be writing 300rword essays about their expectations for the
state, The IS Area Education Agencies wrll then ltclp pick 45 ofthe best
cs iys, and three sttrtlenls from each «\EA will go to Des Moincs in May to
whittlc down ilic thousands ol‘slogan suggestions to four ﬁnalists

Accoiding iii viisiiek's plan. the tour slogans selected as ﬁnalists will be
piinled on a ballot to be run by the state‘s newspapers during June. Thus,
Iowans will have a chance to vole, They'll also be able to log on to the
Internet to make their choice

After the ballots are counted,
the govcmor will announce the new
slogan during ilic lowa State Fair in
August

It sounds like a decent plan,
and it's all quite democratic. But
the important thing, it sccrns to us,
is that the 'tutlcnts — who we hope
will stay in tlic state and become future lowa leaders 7 will be mulling
ovci iust where Iowa is going,

T twill iequiic ii lot ol‘iliouglii It Will liavc to take politics into
considciuiion, because iniich ofwhut happens will depend on how govern.
ment responds riotjttst at the slate lcvclvhut at the local level as well.

The students will also have to consider attitudes. There are plenty ofﬁne
ideas floating around, but the visionaries are havmg a tough time convinc-
ing then follow ltiwiins to take ilic plunge. There‘s a troubling parochialism
that‘s blocking progress on too many I'ionts. That‘s why, for example,
voters in Polk County were unwilling to cnact a local opiioii tax to rehabili~
tare riieir decaying public schools. as why lawmakers enact misguided
iegi Illtm establishing glish as the ofﬁcial language It’s why creative
tliinkc .» who come up with proposals like the Iowa CHILD proiect are met
with antipathy ruihci iliiiii exctlcnieiit. And it‘s why ideas for investing in
llic state's future are shot down because they “cost too much” 7'evcn
though the eventual i-cttiriis would be substantial

We hope the students who take part iii ilic essay contest arc riskrlakcrs,
because that's what Iowa dcsp cly iiectls these days, The challenge is to
convey to the minority of Iowans llllil there is a need to take those risks.

Iowa is a fine nid I‘cln‘ kablc place But its citizens cannot pcnnit the
status club to prevail year after year.

in his or her health,

That will be a major focus ofthc
project involving Grinnell.

The patient’s involvement

“It means the engagement of the
patient in his or her own activities and
socialsurroundings7workplacc,i‘anr
ily, cultural activities and educational
aspects," Schmidt-Ncuhaus said

Nordinc said the idea oi‘inregi-ating
various approaches to health is _a rclar

“Thatcalibccxpandcdbymcrcasing

herself," Nordiiie said,

In what areas"

“The elements of health are pro
tection, preservation, enhancement
plus repair and rt: oration 7 or
liabilitation," he explained,

Impact on the community

And the idea goes beyond the in-
dividual. [t involvesllic culilccommu»
niiy, because a city‘s oivii condition
obviously depends to a great eatciu
upon the health ofils citizurs

“There is- a potcnlial in pioiccis iikc
the ones in Poweshiek County and
Bolzano." Noi'dinc said. “The poleib
rial is to deﬁne a new kind of liczillll
contract between individuals. comptr-

nres and communities — a contract in
whiclicxpenditurcsare allocated across
the full range ofhcalth elements rather
than being focused only on ﬁxing
what's broken. Fixing \vhal's broken
does not help a company improve its
bottom line or help a person become
more compctitive.“

Scliinidt-Neuhaus said that Amer-
ican medicine traditionally has ad-
dressed ilic causes of disease, than
sought to ﬁght those causes and treat
the patient.

What creates health?

“It has never asked the question of
what creates health, what keeps people
healthy,” he said,

So Ncﬁodow's idea of“health gen.
es‘is" comes into play by looking at
factors not necessarily related to the
causcs of disease. Perhaps more im
portant a re the factors that create health,
"even for people who are not healthy,"
Schmidt-Ncuhaus said. He gave on
