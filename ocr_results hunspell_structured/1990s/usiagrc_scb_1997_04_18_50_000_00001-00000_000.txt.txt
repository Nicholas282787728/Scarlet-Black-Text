Next stop: The local drinking hole

Grinnell police use new approach to keep underage consumers in check

BY JILL ERICKSON
News Editor

A cop on duty in a bar these days

is as commonplace as a sloppy pror .

spective on a Friday night in
Grinnell. And for better or worse.
chances are the cops will stick around
for awhile.

The added police presence is part
of a new approach taken by the Grin—
nell Police Department mainly to pre—
vent traffic Violations, including
speeding and driving while intoxi—
cated, according to Police Chief
Michael Birmingham.

But officers also 'may ticket
bargoers under 21 for minor con»
sumption when they visit each local
drinking spot during night patrol.

“The most obvious reason is that
underage drinking is a violation of
the state law,” Birmingham said. He
added that police realize Grinnell is
a college town and that a fair amount
of underage drinking occurs.

Birmingham, 48, came to Grinnell

three years ago after spending time
,in the college towns of Mount
Vernon and Cedar Rapids. The police
department's new approach is simply
a change in Grinnell and does not
result from any significant changes
in state or federal law, he said.

“Having been in this business for
26 years. it just seems to me that
what we’ve done in the past has not
worked," Birmingham said. “I think
we’ve got to change our approach
and if we‘re always in a reactive
mode, that's not protecting soci-
ety the way we should. I‘d rather pre-
vent ten crimes than have to solve
one, It’s a more efficient use of re-
sources.”

Birmingham noted that in many
cities and towns, a separation exists
between citizens and police. In Grinr
nell, he said, the police department
is aiming for a complete change in
operating philosophy which includes
increased friendly interaction be»
tween officers and residents and
other proactive measures. _

“1 think it’s going to pay dividends
over time," Birmingham said, “but

J orie Graham delivers

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

Pulitzer Prize winning poet lorie
Graham spoke about “writing in the
cracks of time” during Thursday’s
convocation at Herrick Chapel. Intro-
ducing her, Professor Jared Gardner
described Graham as “one ofthe truly
great poets of our time” who has
“shaped the way we look at poetry,"
Graham currently is a professor of
creative writing in the Writers’ Work-
shop at the University of Millie. She
has written a number of books and
has won awards including a Lavan
award from the Academy of Ameri—
can Poets and grants from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts,

Graham opened with optimism a
speech entitled, “Contemporary For
etry in America," remarking that

'there is a wider readership of poetry

in the U.S. than in any other English
speaking country. Approximately 40
million Americans read poetry each
week.

When Graham’s offer to donate her
works to an Iowa City Hospital was
turned down due to an “overflow of
poetry at the hospital," Graham dis-
covered that large numbers of pa—
tients want to read poems. She sees
this, she said, as evidence that at

-times of suffering, many people turn
'towards poetry.

“Poetry basembedded in it the

kind of information the human soul,

wants," she said,

Graham has had many questions
about the poetic tradition that has
grown in America. After spending her
childhood in French schools, Graham
said she constantly was exposed to
poetry and a poetic tradition. France
is a place where “all schoolchildren

read poems," she said, In America,-

Graham said, “readers have not been
trained to listen to poems.“

EAG rates book
store items on
A—F scale

The Envrronmental Action Group
has rated items in the college book-
store on an A to F grading scale us.
ing a recently published book as a
reference. Information regarding the
title and author were unavailable at
time ofprint, Vax [EAG] for more in-
formation,

Products were graded according to
the manufacturer’s sponsorship of the
following factors: environmental
concerns, charitable giving, commu»
nity outreach, women's advance-
ment, minority advancement, family,
workplace issues and disclosure of
information. The table of products is
printed on page 4.

 

An American herself, Graham
added that such a lack ofsense about
poetry has transformed her writing.
She now feels a need to get the reader
to sit still and keep them interested,
The American reading environment,
she said, is “filled with deceit," and
other mediums have not helped to
change this,

“Journalism is a pretty suspicious
medium as far as I'm concerned,"
Graham said. According to Graham.
one critic regarded Graham‘s work in
a similarly suspicious manner, call-
ing it the “coat tugging assistance of
the quietly demented."

During a question and answer ses-
sion following her speech Thursday,
Graham discussed the impact of com-
puter technology on poetry. Technol-
ogy is not damaging, she said, ex»
pressing doubt that computers will
replace reading books of poetry. Gray
ham said she saw the transfer from
books to screens as much more than
simply a change of mediums. The
”passage of time crossing over the
paper“ contributes to a certain soli-
tude that a screen cannot elicit, she
said.

“That silence will never exist in
screen," she explained, “That kind of
time doesn’t exist on screen."

Graham also stressed the impor-
tance of writing poetry that ”uses all
your senses." The poet must not only
have a working imagination, but must
“will the poem to go somewhere." if
the active parts of the poem are der
termined before the author writes the
poem, ”dead poetry" will result, Gra-
ham said.

On Wednesday night prior to con-
vocation, Graham read selections of
her work that Prof. James Kissane der
scribed as “intense, difficult, unre-
mitting, and grim."

“They do not try to be ‘ingratiatr
'ing’, either by wit or by the more far

it‘ll take time to convert into that pre-
vcnmiivc mode, The more we work
on and commit time to othcr interac-
tive activrtlcs. Ilint'll help its to [It-
tervcne before problems get out of
hand." .

Although cracking down on under-
age consumption is a secondary ef-
fect of the police department's new
approach, Birmingham said, students
are encouraged to [ltlnk about the
risks associated with drinking before
age 21.

“There’s a potential that if you do
go [to the bar] you'll be caught," Bir»
mingham said, “and whilc that‘s not
a major violation, dcpending on what
you decide to do in later years with
your career, it might hindcr your abilr
ity to work in certain fields.
There's no question that the most
abused drug we have in our society
is alcohol. But if a person’s of legal
age and they drink responsibly,
there’s no problem."

Meanwhile, is added police pres
ence affecting business at local drink-
ing holcs‘.7 '

Troy Kingery. 26, manager of the

convocationThﬁ

Down Under Pub, confirmed tllat the

'pub has done less busxness in recent

weeks, but said the decrease in clir
cntele could be due to a variety of
reasons.

“This time of year, students seem
to be buried in work," Kingery said.
“It also could be an increase in par
ties on campus and in offrcampus
student housing."

Kingery said it would be difficult
to determine whether any significant
portion of the pubs revenue is de»
rived from serving alcohol to under»
age customers. Nineteenr and 20»
year-olds are permitted In the pub
while the grill is open in the back,
and all patrons are required to carry
a picture.ID, he said, However, bar-
tenders in Iowa are not necessarily
responsible when they are fooled by
customers with false identification.

To those under 21. Kingery said:
“In this country, you can be 17 or
18 and get sent off to fight for your
country, but you’ve got to be 21 to
have 2 beer. [Bartenders] aren't the
bad guys, and I’m not saying it‘s the
police who are bad guys either.
