have thctourtaking shape. “It's great
to see all of these bands getting I"—
volved in important issues of the
time," Bondc adds. “Our society has
worked hard to end the problems
ofracism, sexism and homophobia.
Hopefully with the support or the
younger generation, we can kick
racism off the planet.”

. The Ska Against Racism tour’s
main aim is to “raise awareness
about racism today." The tour or-
ganizers and participating bands
feel that the medium of ska music
can reach audiences from all walks
oflife with this message. The tour
hopes to teach young pcoule in par-
ticular, who can make a difference
simply by becoming aware of the
problems that racism poses and
educating themselves about how to
ﬁght racism in their local cornnnr
nities.

The tour kicked off on the west
coast in late March and will travel
through a total of 38 markets in the
US, coming to an end in mid-May
Tworlhousand person capacity av—
enues inc being booked and pro-
moters are encouraged to schedule
the shows with early start times,
accessible to all ages. Actual start
times, age limits and capacities
have varied from market to market.

Ska Against Racism arrives in

land in Antes, and take place at the
Arboretum. For more irtl'onnation,

Kropa 's exhibit depicts a “no-name small Iowa
town. ” His pieces will be on display until May 5.

ons, the sky, halfof the print is a shot
of clouds creating a bubble-like ef-
fect. As the only seemingly active
elementss of any of Kropa’s shown
pieces, clouds act spatially in the
same way as his elongation (car in
“Hi Rolr") and desertion techniques
(“Van Parked on Frontage Road").
What’s real in Iowa is expanse.

On the other hand, Kropa likewise
toys with human constructions, es-
pecially buildings and automobiles.
Besides presenting both real and un-
real, another one of Kropa’s inten-
tions was to portray a no»name small
Iowa town: “I kind of envisioned this
as one town without context
[which is] why the titles don’t place
a town,” Kropa said.

Still, Kropa took most ofhis shots
in Grinnell. The convenientstore in
“Kum and Go Gas Station With
Phone Shaped Pay Phone" is one of
the more obvious photographs taken
in Grinnell, while Arbor Lake and
Grinnell's water tower appear in oth»
ers. None of the titles or subjects
make direct references to Grinnell,
though,

Kropa’s work leads a tour through
a sunny Iowa day, from daybreak to
dusk. His minimalism tends to hone
in on singularimages, as in “Maytag
Laundry,“ “Three Abandoned Store»
fronts" and “Modernistic Beauty Sa-
lon," Overall, Kropa describes his
style as “very plain,“ with “static
composition”

Human presence is essentially ab—
sent from all the pieces, save one or
two unintentional bystanders “I
wanted to deﬁne people by the ar-
chitecture they live in," Kropa said.

Kropa’s exhibit features 24 prints
and will run until May 5

St

prints (all tactfully conﬁned to the
black and white) present something
”unreal," fulfilling Kropa’s goal.
“Duplexes," one of tlrc few photo
graphs taken at night by Kropa, fea-
tures a ball ol'luminescence that ex-
pands over a large portion of the
piece, Kropa’s focus on these natu-

ral phenomena marks his exhibit
with both ordinariness and
fantasticism.

“Old 66 Station" produces a simi-
lar effect. Using what seems to be
one of Kropa’s more powerful weap-

The following statement by Michael
enkins is posted amidst Kropa’s display:

The photographs in this exhibit represent work by Andy
ropa done over the past year throughout central Iowa.

hile the images come from several communities, as a
roup they can be seen as a portrait of the cultivated
:hysical and psychological structures of a single, hypo-
hetical Midwestern community. Kropa concentrated on
he vernacular, and on the modern inexpensive 'ai‘chit'e‘cj-
ural materials used in the pursuit of efﬁciency, in con-
rast to the decorative nature of earlier architecture. The
mages are oftentimes banal, as well as being humorous,
-nd work to achieve a sense of the identity of the people
iving and working in these structures.

Kropa has lived in Iowa all of his life, growing up in Mt.
leasant and attending college at Grinnell. For this project
e chose the familiar subject matter of his own environ-
ent, tinged with his own impression of its sometimes
ppressive nature. He chose not the romanticized farm»
tead perched comfortably atop the oceans of grain, rather
trange and hollow images of the architecture of a small
owa town. This native authorship can be recognized in
is highly sensitive and emotionally charged images of
idwestern America.
