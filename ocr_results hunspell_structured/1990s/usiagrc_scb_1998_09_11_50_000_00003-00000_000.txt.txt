A Look at Early French
New Wave: Origins of
Independent
Filmmaking?

Movies can be more than entertainment—
they can be deeply personal expressions orart.
Most inﬂuential and successful films are not
made by formula directors locked in a produc»
tion line whose only goal is to make the big
Proﬁt, but by serious artists challenging the
form and content ofdominant cinema.

Francois Truiraut, former school dropout
and army desertet, is now generally acclaimed
as one ofthe greatest directors in ﬁlm history.
In the 50's, he belonged to a clan of young
ﬁlm critics who shared an almost religious ens
tliusiasm for cinema. To American public,
used to gossip columns about stars, intellec-
tual writing on ﬁlm must be a strange phe-
nomenon. Just think ofPauline Kael, the well-
known NM YM/zzr critic, who resented the
treatment of film in artistic terms, preferring
to keep the movies “for the masses.’ -

The critical approach that evaluates ﬁlms
by “authorship,” the individual creative force
behind the ﬁlm (namely, the director) became
known as paiitique dc: outrun and was perhaps
among the earliest instances of rebelling against
me oppressive Hollywood studio system. The
“auteurs” of the theoryATruffaul, Godard,
Chabtol, Rohmct, Rivette—were also the ones
to make it come alive in the ﬁlms that they
directed, and they were all identiﬁed under the
heading New Wm.

4'00 Blow; (Truffaut, ‘59) was the ﬁrst fea»
turc ﬁlm by a New Wave director and is come
plctclyautobiographic. This cinematic equiva-
lent to‘ I’iir‘tm‘r afihc Amt: at a Yimrig Mari is
true and touching as few ﬁlms have been and
it still stands as one ofthe best ﬁlms ever made
about adolescence.

In the same year, Godard made his land-
mark debut, Boom/ctr, a truly revolutionary
work, giving the feeling that the techniques or
ﬁlmmaking have just been discovered and ex-
perienced for the ﬁrst time. it is his only ﬁlm
to have the shell ora story line, probably be
cause the initial idcawas provided byTrurraut,
Godard’s later ﬁlms are much more essay-like,
touching upon various scicnrihc concepts:
relativity, role oflight and cncrgy, quantum

jolts é‘ﬁm is Trurraur’s third ﬁlm and is
orten considered his best, combining some
old-rarhioned techniques, the director mastcr-
iully recreates it in!!! Wont, with a simulta-
neous touch orantiquity and freshness. The
love triangle, which could have been dcaltwirh
explaitntivcly, is handled with great delicacy
to reveal the lamentable truth: while one lovtr
is not enough, more than one is too many.

These and other early New Wavc ﬁlms had
several things incommon: they were all spon»
rantous and personal, with small budgets
(which is precisely what allowed them to be
personalrand they all made nicc proﬁts. Their
success encouraged producers to assist other
aspiring young ﬁlmmakers in such pursuits—a
phenomenon that crossed the Atlantic with

independent ﬁlm production in the us.

The Wedding Singer
provokes memories, while
The Proposition Shoots
Blanks

By Jeremy Talbert

Hello all, welcome back to Grinncll, or just
welcome to Grinnell, depending on your own
personal situation. Okay, with that out orthc
way. I‘ll explain a few things about reading my
reviews. First, I don't use stars, or any crap
like that. I use a rating system oronc to ﬁve
that is bascd on the movie. My tried and true
example or this is the movie Swen. in was to
review Scion, rd probably give it a rating of
rouroutorﬁve severed heads in a box. Mmm,
isn’t that a tasty mcntal image.

I'd love to be reviewing thc actual ﬁlms to
be shown in Harris this weekend, but who.
ever the head or me Films Committee is has
decided thcywant to be my worst cncmy, just
like the head orthe committee last ‘year. . After
several emails and no responses, 1 ﬁnally de-
cided that I'll just review some movies i made
the SBLB pay for over the past weekend, If
you know or see the head orrhc Films Com»
mirtee, heckle them, and throw rotten iood in
thcir vicinity.

The ﬁrst movie that i am going to review
here for you all is not likely to endear me to
the trendy, hip idiots on campus. With all me
hype surrounding the actor, i decided i might
as well rent T17: Wedding Singrr starring Adam
Sandlcr and Drew Rarrymote, iwas pleasantly
surprised that this movie didn’t make me vomit
within the ﬁrst ten minutcsl In fact, I only
had dry heavcs maybe once or twice, but that
may have had to do with something i ate.

Anyway, the main premisc orthis movie is
that Adam Sandlct is a wedding singer who is
going to get married, and he loves marriage, is
a really nice guy living in the mid-1980’s. I
did some digging, and round that archeolo-

gists boltcvc such men did exist in that time
period, but sadly bccamt sclcctcd against in
the gene pool and rapidly became extinct, As
biologist Srcphcn i. could told me ovcr a pint
oiale down at the local tavern just yesterday,
“Men who are inclined to marry without sc-
vere stress on the part orthe remalc are not ﬁt
in any way rot survival in the eighties, or any
other time period rot that marttt, Bartender,
another beer please.” “i think you've had
enough, Mr. Gould.” Swim/It: int/r, handiw—
ingirttrr weapon, rndirgintrcrcowmg "screw
you, bastard, i know whcn We had enough to
drink, and i haven't.” Gimkifitlb aim, patter
out. Rrrtcndo to tor/rim drag Irrtr mm o/iry.

As I was saying, this movie wasn’t nearly as
bad as i expected, The humor is sort orme.
diocre, relying almost solely upon thc “I re-
mcmber thatl“ principle. That is, all or thc
jokes arc based on the rack that the target aur
diencc lived in the eighties and will remember
most orthc things that happened. it goes sort
orlikc this: “Hey, woulddt irsuckirsoandso
band btcak up...” and oreoursc we all know
they were killcd in a ﬁery bus crash, and thus.
this is humorous. This movie relies on the
Eighties to back it up so much, it has inspired
a TWO PART soundtrack, rull orthose nos-
talgic empty. tunes we were forced to love
through mind-numbing radio and MTv rcp-
:tition,

The ﬁrst cool part orthis movie is watch-
ing a highcspirited, optimistic young man
crushed singledhandedly by one pooiyhalred
woman. Firstcycur mco, take note oithis. I
took great pleasure in watching an optimistic
Adam sandlct go from singing upbeat wed-
ding songs to “Love stinks" and “Blow my

brains out, please," Hcrcs another thing that
surprised mt, Adam sandler actually has a
somewhat drcent singing voice. The second
majorly cool thing about this movie is that it
succeeded, dciying all laws orphysics and prob-
ably somc Calitornia state Laws, in making
Drew Barrymore look and sound innocent. l
belicvc thc budget for prosthetics and makeup
techniques to covct the extensive damage to
her body done by drug abuse in hot childhood
wassumething to thc runcorsli million. This
movlc also surfers at timts from the Drew
Barrymore Nipple syndrome I reported to you
last year in crayon: Says/Loot Yau, the Woody
Allen musical. Watch for it guySrit's the clos-
est thing to nudity you’re going to get trom
this acrrcss orinnocencc reborn.

in the end, i givc this movie three “1 its
member thatl"3, bccausc that’s about as many
things i remembered. limey would have put
more references in about Eighties movies, toys,
and cartoons, I would have been with them
all the way.

The second movie that I‘ll talk to you about
here is callcd Tic Proparizipn. This ﬁlm is a
generic period piece set somewhere on the east
coast sometimc in the past (probably berorc
WWii), when people were predominately
prudc and stupid. This movie stars Madeleinc
Stowe (mmmm... Madclcinc stowe...) and
William Hurt as a rich couple with a rather
timeless problem. Hurt, a rich and powerful
Catholic attorney, can’t seem to knock up his
lovely young wife. He shoots blanksl i love
that phrase! Let me say it again! He shoots
blanksl He he be. So, because the woman is
one or two andeaehalf feminists of the time,
and she demands to experience the birthing

process, mey decide to ﬁnd some young stud
to donatehis manlyseed to theiriamily. Who,
or all of the people, do they pick to be the
stud.> Doogic Howser, l shit you nor! Neil
Patrick Harris essentially plays the same char
acter rrom Tv tame, a bumbling innocent
young man offered gobs ormoney to boink
this rich beautiful woman nightly until she
turns up ptcggcrs. WARNING: there are no
set scenes in this movie. The director fancies
himselfa tasteful man.

so, you might ask, where’s die beef? (I re»
member that!) or, more spcciﬁcally, where's
the plot? Actually, the plot comes when Hat»
ris, in a in oracring genius, rails in love with
(he mare-er, I mean woman. She ﬁnally gets
pregnant, but he decides he wants her and the
kid. He begins a typical stalker situation, and
turns up dead. Sate to assume, the husband
did it.

Well, telling this whole story is Ken-
neth Branagh, a priest who happens to be the
Hurts brother’s son, in disguise, who joined
the church because it was [he only business
his rathcr couldn't buy out. He has dinner
with the family, and the sexual attraction be»
tween the pricst and the rich maroet woman
is immediate. conveniently, when the rich
lady ﬁnds out her young stud has turned up
dead, she shorts, and thus the stage is set ror
some lovely, blasphcmous sex.

i don’t think I have much more to
say about this movie beyond the fan that the
plot is recycled, the acting is recycled, and rc-
ally diete's nothing meritable about it. To con-
clude, i give this movie the raring or two
boinking Doogie Howsers, Which is far more
than the world could ever handle.

Gardner by Storm

Rainer Maria and Bottledog to perform Saturday

By Molly Gardner
Arts Edi tot

The ﬁrst Gardner concert orthe year will
showcasc two midwestem bands, cach with a
distinct style, but both in line with cvolving
trends in current music.

The first band, Bottlcdog, hails from lowa
City. Matt Ryan, Music Director ror KDIC
and a member or the SGA concerts commit.
rrt, describes the band’s style as “a little er—
perimentahalittleindy pop,alittlcclcctronic,
and a little rpm r'cchno," Such variety in sound
seems to work rot the band, Ryan noted,
“they’re pretty well known in lowa City."

Adding to the band's versatility is the use
ota turntable, samplcs, and drum loops. Ac
cording to Ryan, these elements make the
music, "prttry danceablt."

While Bottledog's rhythms may incite
bodily movement, the music or the second
band, Raincr Maria, aims motc for the spirit.
Heavily inﬁucnccd by the postvpunk “cmo”
scene, Rainer Maria’s music is rich with crc.
scendas and interlocking harmonics. As Ryan
notes, for a band with only three members,

' the sound is surprisingly large.

The large sound, dynamics and intense hat.
monies, ofcourse, only underlie the music’s
central, emotional errcct in iacr, emo, the
genre ormusic to which the band belongs, is a
shortened rorm “tmotional.” Thus, Rainer
Maria's music is otten describcd as “moody,”
and “melancholy,"

To Ryan, this qualiryis appealing, “Rainer
Mana is one oimy favorite bandsml’ve wanted
them to play here rot a while," he said. And
although the band's currcnt following on cam.

pus is still small, Ryan believed that the con.
cert might changc this. “I am sure a lottor
people will like them.“

Arter all, Gardner concerts are intended
partly to introduce students to new music. The
collaboration between KDIC and SGA con.
ccrts Committee in sponsoring the concerts
has so far provcn fruitful toward this end Ryan
called the partnership, “a good mutual effort,"
and indicated that both groups “hope to ex-
pand" the project.

“We’re hoping to bring more shows to cam.
pus." said Ryan, adding “We’d like to get some
big bands, too."

At least for now, though, the primary {04
cus will rcmain upon bands like Rainer Maria
and Bottledog, which arc both largely tindcrc
ground.

“it's kind or near when you hear a band
you've ncvcr heard before,” said Ryan, with a
mischievous smile, “and they really blow you
away,"

The concert begins at 10 pm Saturday in
Gardner loungc.
