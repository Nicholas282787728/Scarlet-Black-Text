Auld Lang Syne

The end of the year provokes many people to look back over their lives
and todeterminewhatthey havelefttoaccomplisht Sincethis is the lastissue
of the Scarlet and Black this semester and the ﬁnal issue for nearly every
member of the editorial staff, this week's editorial is a retrospective look at
the semesteria turbulent fall 1991.

If we were to classify the mood and the events of the semester under one
heading, it would be tension. And that heading could have four sub-
headings, or chapters, which could be said to have careated this tension:
racism, antivSemitism, assault and the Spectator. Each is a separate topic,
with examples of incidents which have incited students and faculty alike.
And each has amused hostility, condemnation and direct action from those
who were affected or who feel targeted

In September. the Spectator
printed a notorious statementabout
a professor; the professor immedi-
ately responded with an accusation

STAF F
of racism, and a seedling of racial E D ITO RIAL
and legal tension was born.

Less than two months later, swastikas appeared on the dorm door of a
Jewish student, and within a two-week period, other hate symbols appeared
in various locations around campus. The seedling continued to grow, and
it inspired a new forth of tension—fear. It spawned a fear of a hidden.
threatening attitude that was pervading the campus to an unknown degree.

And last weekend, the latest installment in a series of assaults this
semester occuredjustoutsideMain Hall. Those whowalked down theSouth
Campus loggia during the subsequentnights passed police ofﬁcers standing
watch. The seedling was growing, and this added a new fear—the fear of
physical harm.

The tension this semester has been unmistakable, and itisdifftcultto ﬁnd
someone who has not been affected in some way, whether this is manifested
inclass discussion, a comment after reading the Spectator, a visit to Student
Affairs or the attendance of a racism workshop People express their fear or
their stress in a variety of ways, and several student organizations rose to the
occasion to educate and encourage understanding In turn, the administra-
tion exercised what they felt to be appropriate action, in the form of ofﬁcial
statements and the clariﬁcation of legal implications.

Perhaps the closing of the semester will enable everyone to reflect over
the past four months and evaluate her/his role in reducing or exacerbating
the tension.

We wish we could say it's been an easy semester. But we won't And we
can't.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students note exclusive
language in survey

To the editor.

The Office of Student Affairs
mailed outa survey on drug and alco»
hol use on campus recently, which
they are asking all recipients to fill
out and return. We request that the
campus community return these sur-
veys to Student Affairs without an
swcring any of the questions, with a
brieflettercxplnining why the survey
was not ﬁlled out. While the survey
may seem innocuous enough at first
glance, take a closer look at question
33: 33. I drink for the following rea-
sons (Check all that apply):

I. to facilitate study

2. to feel comfortable with mem,
bers of the opposite sex

...(15 morepossibleansweis were
includedon thesurvey). Bychoosing
nottoinclude“To feel more comfort-
able around members of the same
sex" as a possible answer, the Office
ofStudent Affairs assumes that all of
the students here are heterosexual,
whichisobviouslynottrue. In lightof
the fact that there is a very large
alcohol/drug problem within the
lesbigay community (approximately
one-third of all lesbigays haveadrug/
alcohol abuse problem) and the fact
that teshigay teens are two to three
times more likely to commit suicide
than heterosexual teens in this coun-

try, there is absolutely no excuse for
the dissemination of this kind of
hcteroscxisttrash byacollege admin
istration that claims to be progressive
with regards to lesbigay issues. By
assuming that we don’texist, Student

insensitivity

To the editor.

The Office of Student Affairs ad-
mits that we made a mistake and take
full responsibility for our mistake by
not including the response "To feel
more comfonable around members
ofthcsamesex"toQuestion 33 of the
Alcohol and Drug Quesu'onnaire. A
corrected version of Question 33 will
be sent to all students.

to participate in the study. Students
interested in revising the question-
naire for future years should contact

Student questions individual

SCARLET &B LACK rights at Grinnell

To the editor.

The administration was right. I
shouldn'tliveinﬂtedorms. Someone
who represents such a small percent-
age of the campus population cannot
have individual needs met, I am an
individual among 1200 other indi-
viduals. and I must make compror
mises.

I atn a vegan; I was admitted to
Grinnell with the understanding that
thcre was a vegan meal plan. The
administration made a mistake: there
is no vegan meal plan. I have spent
the past year and a half trying to
improve the meats in the dining halt.
And although the meals have im-
proved markedly, I still must pur-
chase over $300 worth of food each
semester on top ofregulardining scrr
vices costs. I can no longer pay the
costs for meals in the dining hall that
I do not eat.

I am willing to live offrcampus as
Lheadministrationsuggestcdlastyear.
Because Iain leaving atthcend of the
semester to study abroad for a year, I
cannot draw into a co-op for second
semester or coordinate a house, so I
have decided that theonly alternative
is to live in a nonrcollege owned
house. The administration will not
releaseme from theobligationtolive
on campus and therefore to eat meals
in the dining hall. After three weeks
of deliberation, Tom Crady‘s reason

for this decision is that ifhe makes an
exception in this one case, he would
have too many other people requestr
ing the same thing, and because enr
rollment is uncenain he wants to en-
surcthatthcdorrns willnotbeempty.

Last year, the only alternative that
theadministratorsofferedtoeatingin
the dining hall, which they agreed
was insufﬁcient for my needs. was
off-campushousing.Atthattime.off—
campushousingwasanoption which
for various reasons I thought was
inappropriate. Now I am willing to
takethisoption,andIamnolallowed
to. Certainly, my chances for being
granted leave in the spring are good
considering our current overcrowd»
ing. Still, the financial risk is the
reason they will not grant me off
campus leave, and the reason that I
need it. IfI sign a lease and am not
granted offrcampus leave, I will be
responsible for thc costofon-carnpus
housing, rent (from the off-campus
house) the meal plan and the extra
money that I spend on meals that I
cannot get from tltc dining hall.

Unfortunately, I am one of the
individuals who doesn’t make up a
significant enough proportion to in-
clude in the administrative rules, and
the administration cannot accom mo-
date individual needs.

Survey is a
grammatical
nightmare

To The editor.

On December 2 I received “The
Alcohol and Drug Questionnaire"
from the Office of Student Affairs.
Although no survey may be perfect
and free from bias, the Alcohol and
Drug Questionnaire is absurdly and
unforgivably sloppy. The survey’s
imprecisc use oflanguage forces the
respondent to make inferences, thus
jeopardizing its statistical accuracy.

The following points illustrate ,
some of the problems with the sur-
vey:

1) The questionnaire provided no
appropriate rcsponseblanks forques-
tions concerning my age. major. and
grade point average.

2) Question three asks, “With
what cultural group do you
identify??[sic]” The responses,
though. referred to possible cultural
groups I mightbe irt. Itry to identify
with all cultural groups.

3) Question 10 asks, “What is
your religiouspreference?” The ques-
tion assumes that the respondentpre-

Chaplain
denounces
additional
meaning of
swastika

To the editor, 7

Concerning your November 15th
editorial “The truth to the symbol." it
isimportanttoaddthetruththatwhen
the Nazi Party adopted the swastika
as its insignia, they adopted a re-
spected form of the Christian cross,
theswastikabeingamoreomztteform
of the Greek cross. In so doing, they
translated the central Christian sym-
bol oflovc, sacriﬁce, redemption and
Easterlife into one ofhatred, destruc-
tion and death. totally contrary to the
views of Jesus, who dies on a cross.

So many Christians wcrc silent
when the Nazis did this translation
and destruction. How sad it would be
if Christians today, here and now,
maintain this silence when swastikas
appear on campus. Because this
‘Now" symbol of hatred is not only
anti-Semitic.itisalsoantirChristmnti-
Christian and anti-every loving and
caring act Christians are called to
stand for!
