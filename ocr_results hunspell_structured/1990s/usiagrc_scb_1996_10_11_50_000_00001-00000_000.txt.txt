Police nab three students atop water tower
City drains 300,000-gallon tank as part of “public health protocol”

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

At 8:00 am on Wednesday nlorning
Grinnell College students Michael Hanna,
Josh Godine and Jeff Root were arrested
for the crime of criminal trespass at the
water tower located at 2nd St. and Main.
The affidavit issued 10 the three describes
the event as “unlawfully enlcr[ing] upon
the property of another, leaving objects
animate or inanimate upon the property."

At 6:30 a.m., Hanna, Godine, and Root
climbed the loo-foot tower and ate a
breakfast while watching the sun rise. The
Grinnell Police Department responded to
a call that three people were on the water
tower. Just before 8:00 am. officers Dan
Bonnemn and Dave Sears arrived at the
base ofthe tower in separate cruisers.

The students were requested to climb
down off the tower by the officers, who:
waited as they descended. Upon descent
the students were arrested and taken into
the station where they were charged and
brought to court at 10:30 am. the same
day. Each was fined $90 for criminal tres-
pass, a misdemeanor. Also on the scene
was Ian Anderson, City Superintendent
of Sewer and Water.

Ian Anderson subsequently climbed
the tower to check for tampering. He said
that the hatch located at the top of the
tower had remained locked and had not
been tampered with. Nevertheless, Mr.
Anderson, in an attempt to ensure that the
water supply reinnined safe, closed the

tower off from the rest of the city water
system. Although there was no sign of
tampering or contaminants, Mr. Anderson
decided to have the 300,000 gallon water
tower drained Anderson said that he
acted under a “protocol to protect the
public’s health." According to the afﬁdar
vit, Mr, Anderson did ﬁnd a box contain-
ing a pastry box, newspapers, and flow
ers on the towers catwalk, 130 feet in the
air, According to Hanna these are remr
nants oftheir breakfast which they didn‘t
remove because the police had arrived and
ordered them off the tower.

The trio was fined the amount of the
drainage bill, $241.38. At the time they
had been surprised that the issue of water
tampering had been raised. They state that
they had not climbed to the very’ top of
the lower to the location of the hatch, re
maining instead on the cat walk. The
tower's lower ladder was covered mak-
ing climbing difﬁcult, but according to the
students, they did not see any trespassing
signs or any other indication that the tower
was offlimits. The students said that they
would not have climbed the tower if they
had known the potential threat that climb-
ing the water tower poses to the commu-
nity.

Hanna said, “that [tower] is like a
cruise ship. I mean that thing is huge.
What the heck are we going to do on it,
other than sit there? There was no way,
we thought, that [what happened] was a

MOST encourages student
minorities in sociology

 

. , , it,
MOSTIIparticipanl Rachel
Munoz with Professor Jon Cruz,

Staff Writer

 

 

 

For the past three years, Grinnell has
been one of ﬁfteen undergraduate schools
in the United States to participate in the
second stage of the American-Sociologir
cal Association's program, Minority Op-
portunities in Structural Transformation

     

(MOST). The goal of this nationwide pro-
gram, funded by a large grant from the
Ford Foundation, is to strengthen the edu-
cation of minority students in sociology
at both undergraduate and graduate
schools and to create minority leaders in
this field. Speciﬁcally, the portion of the
program in which Grinnell was involved,
MOST II, was aimed at encouraging mi—
nority students to enroll in sociology
graduate, as well as reforming sociology
programs to be more inclusive of
multicultural issues.

MOST II involved a three year series
of summer institutes for undergraduate
students at graduate universities and
changes within Grinnell’s sociology dc»
partment. Professor Christopher Hunter
who created the proposal for Grinnell's
admittance into the program said, “The
Sociology Department applied for the
MOST program so that some of our stu-
dents would beneﬁt from the summer pro
grams at graduate departments and so that
we could reinforce our existing efforts to
transform our department, particularly
around the issues of race and ethnicity,

Films committee requests
new 35mm projector

By COURTNEY SHERWOOD
r News Editor

Frequent interruptions in movies have
become a way oflife at the Harris Center
Cinema, Although student projectionists
are trained to change reels, “it’s impos-
sible to get itjust right," said Films Com-
mittee memberAmy Llngenfelden ‘99 In
addition, the picture and sound quality is
lower than would be found in a commerv
cial theater. It is for these reasons that
the Films Committee is petitioning the
Committee on Student Life for funding
to purchase a new 35mm projector.

Grinnell College has VCR: and a la-
ser disk player, which could be used to
avoid the glitches associated with chang-
ing ﬁlm reels. New releases and cultural
ﬁlms, however, are only available on ﬁlm.
Such recently played movies as Jame:
and the Giant Peach, Fargo, Farinelli,
and The War Room were all unavailable
on video orvlaser disk when they were
shown. Projectors “allow you access to a
greater number of new releases. foreign
ﬁlms, independent ﬁlms, and things like
that" said Films Committee Chair Matt
Saiia ‘97,

The college currently uses 16mm pro-
jectors which generally require two or

three reel changes per movie, They have
no capacity for surround sound, they dis
play images darker than those of more
modern projectors, and they break fre»
quently. Repairs are becoming increas-
ingly difﬁcult to obtain, as only two re-
maining companies continue to work with
16mm projectors and neither company is
based in Iowa. In addition, 16min projec-
tors are being used increasingly in busi»
ness presentations instead of movies as
35mm projectors take over in the popular
media. “The projectors that we have are
the kind that every elementary school has
for when it rains," said Saiia,

When the Films Committee began to
consider ways to improve the current ar-
rangement, it took into account repair is-
sues and the fact that new movies are gen-
erally recorded on 35mm ﬁlm stock. The
Harris Center Cinema was originally de
signed with 35mm projectors in mind, ac-
cording to Saiia, but it settled for 16mm
projectors for ﬁnancial reasons. “If we’re
going to look toward replacing what
we’ve got, 35mm is the way to go," Saiia
said. “16mm projectors are OK, [but]
Grinnell is not a place to settle for just
OK.“

Burling take-over in 1971 commemorated by CBS
Students read pertinent selections from Angelou, Hughes, Truth

By JUSTIN GLANVILLE
EditoHn—Chicf

To Commemomtc a 1971 protest in
which approximately 55 black students
occupied Burling Library, Concerned
Black Students (CBS) staged a poetry
reading In the Library on Wednesday
night.

The original protest took place on No-
vember29, 1971 (a sccondtake-overoc-
curred a year later). The 3&1; reported
that “all or most" of the black students

_ attending Grinnell at the time took part

in thc lake-over, which lasted from 7 15
am until 12:30 pm. No whites were ads
milled to 1hc library during this time, with
the exceptions of certain administrators
and the Head Librarian.

The administration was presented on
thatday With the Bllick Manifesto, a list
of ten demands drawn up by CBS in or-
der to improve the Situation of Africans
rind African-Americans on campus. The
demands called for, among other things,

an increase in black student enrollment
to “no less than 200," increased presence
of black students in College Council and
administrative meetings, a larger Black
Cultural Center, a Black Library in
Burling and a Black Studies majorr

“I doubt a lot of people on campus
know about the take-over of the library,"
said CBS Spokesperson Lisa Alexander
‘97. Alexander cited a desire to remind
the Grinnell community of the takeover
as one reason for holding the reading.
“Grinnell has a bad turnover rate —
people graduate and then their accom-
plishments don't get carried out fully or
recognized (by the newcomers)."

The poetry selections Wednesday night
were presented by student members of the
African/African-American community on
campus, each of whom read between one
and three poems they felt commented in
some way on feelings surrounding the
original event. The poets and writers rep
resented included Langston Hughes,
Maya Angelou, Irma McClaurin and So

journer Truth. Alexander served as mod-
erator, introducing each reader in turn.

“I tried to find some poems that dealt
with what was happening at that time,“
said Derek Daniels ‘98.

Daniels read two poems by Irma
McClaurin, a Grinnell graduate and an
Assistant Professor of Anthropology here
two years ago. “I didn’t know her that
well while she was here," he said, “but
she inspired me because she was a poet.”
In addition, Daniels read one of his own
poems, “Pesky Mosquito? which he com-
pleted two weeks ago.

Several participants commented on
their selections before they read, Fred
Mann ‘97 said, “The students back then
must have been very fearful; they must
have been very afraid. They must have
prayed and asked God what to do." Mann
then read Langston Hughes’ “Dream of
Freedom," and dedicated his last selec—
lion. also by Hughes, to “the people who
will be here after I leave,"

CBS Historian and Communications

Coordinator Dright Burks ‘99 also chose
a Langston Hughes poem, entitled
“Mother and Son." He said his mother had
sent him the poem last semester during a
particularly stressful point in the academic
yeah

CBS Activities Coordinator Jocelyn
Prcwitt ‘99 concluded the evening with
selections from Sojourner Truth’s “Ain’t I
a Woman?" speech, and Alexander
thanked the assembled audience of 130-
140 students and faculty ”for sharing this
special event with us."

President Pam Ferguson, who was
present at the event, said, "I thought this
was a very powerful and wonderful per-
fon'nance and I was very proud to be in
attendance."

Daniels and Alexander also expressed
satisfaction with the reading. “I was very
pleased With the tumrout," said Alexander. ‘
“And I was pleased with the readers as
well."

A reception in the Forum followed the
reading.
