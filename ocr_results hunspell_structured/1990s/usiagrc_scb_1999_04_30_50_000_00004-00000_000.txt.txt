A Little History of Yugoslavia

The Balkzlls is sirasegioally a very impossans region in Europe Nos only is is she only land
rouse so she Middle Est, is is also eiisieally close so she oil and mineral sieh region oi she
Caueuses. Is is nos hy eoincidenee shas she hiss Woild War was named in die Kingdom oi
Sohia. Neiihes is is a coincidence dias I-lisles deemed die Balkans so impossans shas he delayed
his invasion of Russia (opesasion Bashosossa) by a csucial 6 weeks in osdes so sake oves she
Ealkans (operasion Resiihudonl. Sam: say shis delay means shas German ssoops had so ﬁghs in
she wines, and dis winses hghsing eoss shem she was. Regardless of she validiiy oi shis argu»
mens, is is clear shas Hides eonsidesed sapiuiing she Ealkans heiose an assaek on Russia so
impossans shas he was willing so risk a winies wall, Susely liisles knew shas Napoleons iosces
suliered deieas passially herause of she iiesee Russian winsei. The sssasegie imposianee of die
Ealkans can he gauged riom she iaes diai Hides was willing so sake shis sisk despise a glaring
hissosie pieeedens,

The ssshian, Cioasian. Bosnian, Monsenegsin, Macedonian, and Slovenian people iesisied
againss she Nazi asiaek and shrough a popular was undei she command oiMassial Tiso and wish
die hdp of die larger Soviei oriensive wese ahle so dereai she Nazis and crease an independens
and sovereign siase shas was dedicased so she ideals oisocialism, During she sold was she us
govesnmens manipulaied she Yugoslav iedesaiion away isom she socialiss hlock. However, wish
she end orshe cold was she US govesnmens had no hisihes use ios shis one sime ally againss she
Sovies Union simply heeause she sovies Union did nos ekisianymose Thus, hegan she era oi she

dismemhesinens oi die Yugoslav Eederaiion, Substquenrly, she US govesnmens has pussued a '

policy oihieaking up she Yugoslav Federasion inso small swallowahle pieees by encouraging and
lundiug eshnic wars and shen “inservening so siop shem" hus essensially iaking shem oves.
Why is the US so interested in Yugoslavia?

Everyone muss have head of she was on Yugoslavia low mass people can nos make our she
moiive hehind such a was. The seasons are quiz: clear. I can poins so 5 sisaiegie seasons ios she
eussens mission in Yugoshvia. All shese seasons are compiled irons she very speeches oius
memhess oissase.

1) DESTROY SOCIALISM lN EUROPE: The US is inieiessed in dessioyingevery lass
vesdge oiSoeialisi siases in Europe.This has heen she ssiaiegy oishe US ios she lass so years
Yugoslavia, alihough a socialiss siaie, uniossunasely played a sole in shis very mission duiing she
sold was. liovveves, soday is is she has semainmgsocialissssase in Eusopc, and sheseiose, a palm
sial diseai so she ssahilisy oloipiialism in Europe. The US recognizes shas a socialisi Europe
means she demise oieapiialism in she world Is is willing so use deceis and iosee so manipulase
die eiieumssanees in such a way shas Europe remains seaesionary and capisaliss.

2) PREVENT A COMMUNIST RUSSIA: The US govesnmens has proved much iusihes
ahead in iss shinking shan she sees oishe wosld in undesssanding she sisuasion in RussiaThe iacs
is shas eapiialism '

has iailed in Russia and US govesnmens is expeesing a mayor haeklash againss she suling

President Osgood, I can’i ges inso classes anymore. presidens Osgood,
when I do ges inso classes shey are soo huge ios people so have a seal voice.
Why are shese classes shas are consissensly oveshooked so more shan swice
capaeisy, like Linguissies or American Tradiiions 11— only offered once a
year? Why have I almosi complesed my English maiorwishous haying read a
good book? a centrat’mson for me wanting to be an English major— for
class in yeassi Why does she regisssas nos iniosm people shey can’t graduase
on sime heeause credies won's sransier only aises iss soo lase so do anything?
Why am I paying shis college all shis money ios an educasion shas doesn's
givc me the skills I used? Why is the word “skills” so forbidden? How does a
“History ofl’hyslcs" elass help me more as a person shan a' class in journal»
ism? Why does SPARC nos have enough money so iund exissing pubiica»
lions, let alone new ones? ... '. ,'

And what this comes down to is, President Osgood, truétcex, and admin-
issrasion, why don‘s you care? And why don's you even listen? Ask seniors
how shey ieel ahous shis school, and l shink you'll iind shas shey love many oi
she people, sheis rsiends, she iaculry and ssaii But you’ll also rind shas many
oishem are jaded. Is is nos apashy, is is exhaussion. Many oishe changes and
evenss shas have occurred in she last few years have been disillusioning, so say
the lcast.

To he honess, I don’t give a damn ahous she expensive, hig new buildings
on campus. They are psessy (sort or), and in some ways even iunesional, hus
having shem on campus doosn‘s make us sane, and is doesn'i even make over.

ssudens concerns wish compassion and an open mind, hy nos giving us some
semhlanee oi power and responsihilisy ios she school we choose so some so
and ssy so make a difference in, how do you expect us so respond?

I ask you shis, Presideni Osgood, and all she people yous siile sepsescnis:
