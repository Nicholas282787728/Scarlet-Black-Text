Czechowski’s “After
Easter” touted as a

must-see

PHOEBE SILAG
StaffWriter

“After Easter" by playwright
Anne Devlin will be performed next
weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sun»
day at 8 p.m, in the Flanagan Arena
Theatre. First performed by the
Royal Shakespeare Company in
1994, the production includes
Devlin’s familiar themes of exile and
return, male-female relationships.
and the backdrop of political vio-
lence in Northern Ireland.The
Mainstage Theatre Production is di-
rected by Jan Czechowski.

Czechowski, who has researched
and travelled in Ireland the past few
summers is currently teaching a
seminar on Irish drama. He is “par-
ticularly interested in Irish women
writers, who have not been getting
much attention,” and he revised the
syllabus so that it would include
more women.

“Women writers of Ireland are
writing very good works. And
women are running theatre compa-
nies in Northern Ireland and in the
Republic of Ireland. I chose ‘After
Easter” because I feel so strongly
about the work these women are do-
ing, and because we are studying
these writings in the Irish drama
course." Czechoswki says. “When
we teach seminars, we try to produce
a play that we are working with in
class," Czechowski said.

"This one is one of the most ac»
cessible to students and the campus.

It’s set in Northern Ireland, mostly .

. Belfast.

“Devlin draws on the things that
have inﬂuenced the life of the
woman who is the main character.
The woman has ‘short-circuited,’
because of all the inﬂuences in her
life - religion, politics, fa'mily — that
have created her and contributed to
her identity crisis. Ironically, she
returns to those veryelements : relic
gion, politi a d family - h' h
candied hei’c'ns‘is as 'sbtiices for ‘a ’
lution, to ﬁgure out who she is, where
she belongs and what she believes.”
Czechowski says. “It’s about a
woman who is having something of
acrisis of identity. She goes back to
those things that formed herifam—
ily, home, religion, politics, relation—
ships. She is trying to ﬁgure out who

she is given all these factors that
formed her, The political troubles in
Ireland are the back drop to the whole
piece."

During a weeklong seminar on
“Conﬂict resolution in Northern Ire-
land" at the University of Coleraine
in Northern Ireland in January,
Czechowski and others met with rep-
resentatives from a variety ofpoliti-
cal parties. ”We discussed their Zip-
proaches to conﬂict resolution. Ire-
ally felt it was quite helpful in unr
derstanding what‘s going on in
Northern Ireland. It also helps me
more thoroughly understand the
drama. the writing and the plays. I
can offer this information to the stun
dents in the class I’m teaching. and
also to the students who are acting
in ‘After Easter.m Czechowskj says.

The play‘s thirteen characters
have been developing Scottish and
Irish accents for the performance.
They have worked with dialect tapes
and video tapes. in addition to work-
ing with Czechowski. “In rehearsal.
we’ve had several sessions where the
actors have talked and listened to
each other," Czechowski said. “The
Northern Irish dialect is unique and
very different from standard Irish,
Northern Irish is kind of a mix of
Irish and Scottish. There are some
sounds in the dialect that you just
don‘t hear anywhere else. It’s actur
ally kind of a tough accent to do."

Czechowski decided to incorpo-
rate the accents because of the play's
subject matter.

“There are enough references in
the play to differences in background
that are identiﬁable by accent," he
said. “One of the issues of the play
is whether the characters are Irish or
Scottish or American, The way
people sound is an important part of
how they talk to each other.

“It’s partly just a training thing,"
he added. “It’s good for them to learn
how to do it, and to some extent. to
show them how hard it is. It's a tool
'they will be abl'e't‘o use in the future."

Free tickets will be available at the
Grinnell College theatre box office
in the FineArts Center from 175 pm.

April 17. Contact Conni Gause at
