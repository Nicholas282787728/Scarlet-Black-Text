:The Right View of multiculturalism

Lately, writers for the Scarlet and
‘Black have made approving noises
,about multiculturalism. Their ap-
proval of the doctrine strikes me as
xreflexive, for anyone who devotes a
«little thoughtto multiculturalism can
see its intellectual weakness,

‘ Multiculmmlists ask, what is it
about the works of long-dead, white,
,European males that makes theRight
insist that they are so important and
‘descrve special attention? It is the
«lac! that the ideas in these works
have. for centuries, inﬂuenced people
’alloverthe globe. Seminal menin the
histories of America and Western
,Europe were inﬂuenced by the ideas
of Thomas Jefferson, John Locke,
flcan-Iacques Rousseau and other
vWestern writers. Central and Eastern
Europe, the Soviet Union, Asia and
‘Africahave long witnessed astruggle
between followers of Karl Marx,
A dam Smith and American Demo-
CIBE.
’ No writer outside the Western tra-
,dition has exerted a global inﬂuence
To besure, there were writers in India
*and China who had a tremendous
rregional inﬂuence but not a global
yone. No one is arguing that works by
Indians. Chinese, and other groups
3not connected with Europe do not
,have aplace in me curriculum. People
who want to study them should be
‘able to.
, But to emphasize Western works,
‘multiculturalists believe, is to encour~

age thinking that has led to an inher~
ently racist, sexist and imperialist
culture, This they contrast with a
peaceful and egalitarian Third World
culture, which they want to promote.

In 1967, when a movement in the
Eastern part of Nigeria tried to form
an independent state called Biafra,
mostofthcotherAfrican states helped
the Nigerian regime put down the
secessionists, Having overthrown and
replacedtheLibyan presidentin 1969,
Moammar Qaddafi’s junta tried to
overthrow five more African rulers,
including Sadat in Egypt. In 1973
Sadat, following Nasser. invaded ISA
rael, a peaceful neighbor. This was
one of fourattempts by Egypt to con-
quer the Jewish state. In 1977,
Katangans carried out a Communistv
backed invasion of Zaire. The next
year, Idi Amin sent troops into Tan-
zania, which eventually reciprocated
by invading Uganda. Ethiopia and
Somalia have waged gruesome bor»
der warst (African spokesmen never
deplore these eventsithey are too
busy denouncing the West for imper
rialism and blaming Africa’s prob-
lems on it.)

The British occupation of India.
ended by popular resistance in 1948,
is as clear a case of imperialism as

history has seen. But arguably the
British presence was positive. For
centuries irt India, there was a tradi-
tion called the mace, in which, when
a man died, his wife burned with him
in a funeral pyre. even if she was still
young and healthy. Appalled by the
sultee. the British tried to end it and
managed to curtail it. What is a femi-
nist anti-imperialist to think?

History has Seen extreme sexism
in the Third World, from Afghani-
stan, Wherea Mujahedeen leader told
an American Spectator correspon-
dent that he had “two children~and
five daughters,”tolndia.asshown,to
China, where Mao rode around on a
train and picked out the best women
in each village where he stopped.
Racism,tWAmband Africanlcadr
ers have had a way of departing un-
wanted ethnic groups. We deplore
racism in the Afrikaaners; we ignore
itin blacks and Arabs, (This in itself
is racist—we hold the whites to a
higher standard.)

The self-proclaimed multi»
culturalists are not so multiculturalist
as they say. In many African cul-
tures, as well as in China. homosexu-
ality is viewed asadisgusting aben-a-
Lion. Marxist Cuba and semi-socialist
Argentina are infamous for their pet-
secution of homosexuals In fact,
“queers" have a rough time in most
cultures outsideAmerica andEurope.

HAPPY NATIONAL COMING
’OUT DAY! As if you didn’t already
. know, this is one of the grandestdays

in Queerdom ever. I don’tknow who
“thought it up. but whoever it was
vshould deﬁnitely be Queen. This is
the day, of all 365 days. that there is
‘national support for those who
restrugglelo comeoutevery day. Com-
King out of the heterosexual closet is
nota one-dayprocess,however. Com-
eing out, per se. occurs any time you
,make it known to anyone else that
you are Queer. Anyone. Anytime.

arid you stutter and correct her. it

.rncl. When you sendyour aunrin Utah
a card mentioning your Significant
Other and use the correct pronoun,
it‘s a day for coming out. When you
decide to get a joint checking ac-
count, and put a double wimmin’s
symbol in the corner, you comeout to
_ everyone from the pizza deliverer to
the utility company. Coming out is
not hiding. One piece of advice my
dyke-aunt gave to me was, “Don‘t let
them make you lie. Don’t compro~
mise yourself." Don't let others as
sume you are what you are not.

For many people. the most impor»

Meshing: Grinnell-style

After the ﬁesta that was the Urge
Overkill concert, complete with a re-
ally stupid pit, and in anticipation of
concerts to come, which will most
likely have the same type of stupid
pit. we think it is appropriate to list
some basic guidelines for moshing,
With this, hopefully, we can avoid
any unnecessary stupidity.

Commandment 1. THOU
SHALT NOT MOSHI Period. Be-
cause, let’s face it, most of us here
really don't know how. And wejust
plain look stupid. The number ofstu—
dents atthis school who have actually
been to a hardcore or real metal
show—not some glam band stoppin’
through at the state fair to play to a
bunch of high school wrestlersﬁis
meager at best. And if you haven’t
done it before, you sure aren’t going
to learn here. Go study your econ.
Next summer, go to a REAL show at
a REAL club and study some dancer
You can’t get that kind of education
here no matter what the tuition hike.

Commandment 2. If you insist
on ignoring the fust commandment,
keep this in mind: THOU SHALT
QUIT FRONTW’. No matter how
many ripped concert T-shirts you’ve
gotten passed down from your older
brothers or sisters, we still know that
none of you are very hardcore. Soquit
changin’ into thosedamn concert tees
every time you think you gotta im-
press the campus with your musical
worldliness. And quit wearin’ those
damn Lollapalooza shirts every time
a Strat gets plugged into a Marshall.
Don’t wear boots unless they‘re
scuffed fora reason, and don’treason
that boots give you permission to step
on toes.

Commandment 3. And speaking
offootwear, THOU SHALTCOVER
THY TOES. Not with sandals and not
with docksiders, but with something
that will not leave your feet. Some-
thing with laces (which implies usin’
the laces), because maybe you know
that the idea of slarnmin’ is not just
jumpin’ into others without thinking
that somebody could be wearing

b’stocks, but nobody else out there
does If you don’t heed this advice.
Elisacould verylikelybetheone who
personally crushes all the bones in
your feet. Helmets, however, are not
necessary.

Commandment 4. THOU
SHALT EX?ECT BODILY CON-
TACT. You‘re at a concert. not a
movie, If people are shoving and you
don’t like it, you might as well just
move to some place where people
aren‘t shovirtg. Most people aren’t

touching you on purpose: it’s just the
nature of the crowd. If your private
space is being invaded, then you may
want toask yourself, “Am I to expect
that everyone in this crowd knows
what my contact tolerances are, or am
I pretty much a butthead [or ﬁguring
I could put myself in a crowd and
expect them all to conform to my
ideas?" Pits are dangerous. If you
can’t handle an occasional elbow in
the ribs or face, leave.
Commandment 5. THOU
SHALT NOT CARRY OUT PER-
SONAL VENDE'ITAS INTHE PIT.
Don‘tintentionallyhurtpeople. Don’t
useyourbuttasaweapon.Slamdanc-
ing, atleast the way they taught it in
the old school, is aggressive dancing
to aggressive music. Moshin‘ in a
circle did not come about just be-
cause some people wanted to run
around in a circle and clock those
around the perimeter. rather it was
another activity tailored to ﬁt the en-
vironment (i.e. the small dance ﬂoor
at a club, or the small area thatcan be
cleared out in front of the stage at a
large show). Besides, if all goes well,
someone will eventually give blood
anyway. Don‘tpush it.
Commandment 6. Tl-lOU
SHALT ONLY MOSH WITH
