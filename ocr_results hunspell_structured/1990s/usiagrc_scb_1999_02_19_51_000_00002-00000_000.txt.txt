ing on a similar schedule. With two
nights in the big town, they scheduled
two theater performances, “Cats" and
an offrBroadway newcomer.

Unfortunately, they werenot able to
get tickets for the opening night of
“The Iceman Cometh,” the Eugene
O‘Neill play which opened Saturday
night in which Michael Emerson,
Karen‘s nephew, son of Carol and
Emerson ofCrrinnell, plays one ofthe
roles.

“We‘ll do that next month," says
Karen.

Nothing as exciting as when “the
great iron horse" arrived in Grinnell
Sunday afternoon has happened in
some time. ‘

To oldsters it was Jet/a vu with a
splash, to youngsters it was the stuf't‘of
storybooks. When the booting chug—
ging engine hove into view from the
east, and even right on time, everyone
was thrilled.

And, Around might add, so was the
group from Iowa City which ac-
companied the train in support of in-
creased funding for science centers in
lowa, who came offthc train beaming
at the enthusiastic response from
Grinnellians.

Tours of the train were available,
and handing everyone up the steps
was none other than Mayor Pro-Tern
Jim White playing train conductor

In charge of arrangements for the
Grinnell stop was karen Lowell, a
scientist whose husband David
Campbell — a biology professorat the
college e and daughter were among
those who rodethetraintoitsnextstop
in Newton. Accompanying the

Campbell: was Charlie Wilhelm, a
train aﬁcionado ofthe ﬁrst ‘orderwho
studies trains up close a‘nd personally
from his residence, a former railroad
hotel across the railroad tracks from
The Depot Crossing restaurant which
served as the traditional stop for the
train.

The Depot, in fact, in a salute to its
roots and a gesture ofgood will for its
role in the event, served refreshments
to the assembled crowd, no doubt in
lieu ofa dining car.

Former Iowa Senator Jean Lloyd-
Jones, honorary trainmaster for the
expedition, detrained brieﬂy to greet
Grinnell friends and reminisce about
an earlier train which bore legislators
to Grinnell to visit the Iowa Peace
Institute.

“When can we ever start having
regular passengerservice again?" was
the question on many lips. Maybe next
year, accordingto a report in Thursday
moming’s Des Moines Register.

A caravan of automobiles which
drove to Newton to retrieve the hand-
ful of passengers who made the trip
reportedly drove faster than the train
did en route on its westerly trek, in»
spired by the fact that it was on a
leisurely sightrseeing trip as well as a
serious scientiﬁc one.

And as the train wended its way out
oftowntothe west, it inspired in some
with long memories visions of presi-
dential campaign trains which crossed
the continent in an earlier day, and
images of Dwight Eisenhower and
Harry Truman wavin g good-bye from
the rear platform as they ieit town.

for the school’s "Change for Change" program, an effort to help buy new playground equipment. The

Mayflower residents give $213K

Mayﬂower residents collectively
have pledged $213,519.54 to Grin-
nell Regional Medical Center‘sBuild-
ing on Excellence fund drive.

The donations were pledged in ad-
ditiontoMayﬂower's$10,000corp0r
rate pledge.

“The continuum ofcare is very im-
portanttoresidents ofthe Mayflower,"
said Ted Mokricky, executive direc—
tor of Mayﬂower Homes, Inc. “The
scope of medical service and quality
of physicians are instrumental in a
resident‘s decision to come to Grin-
nell Aboutonerthirdofourresidents
move from another state, so access to
quality health care is a mayor
consideration. The positive response
to the Building on Excellence drive is
not surprismg."

Netia Worley, president ofthe Mays
ﬂower Residents Association, helped
organize the drive and said the re-
sponse lS directly related to the resi-
dents'perceptionsofthemedicalcen-
ter and staff,

“One of the best assets to Grinnell
is to have them, so they want to sup-
port the medical center’s fund drive.
The residents come from many states
and compare our facility to health-
care faCIIities from across the nation.
They're very satisfied with the care
available here.”

Mary Lou andBeryl Clotfelterhave
lived in Grinnell for many years and
have used Grinnell Regional.

“We've been extremely pleased
with the care provided in Grinnell,"
Mary Lou Clotfclter said. “When I
dealt with cancer a few years ago, the
care I received was very good, I don‘t
think I could have receivedbettercare
elsewhere. The surgeons and chemo-
therapy staff were wonderful.

“A good hospital addstothequality
oflife for us. That‘s why we chose to
pledge to the campaign and to help
solicit funds for the medical center.
We feel strongly aboutsupporting the
quality of care available and have
faith in the doctors and staf
