wards are more valuable than

lems, form friendships, and learn
many lasting life lessons. Lister
Stroope said that “working with
people" ls ivhat has been most
valuable to her,

Lister Stroope speculated
about the reason behind tile my
teresl in an organization such as

Stacey Knhut, who 15 currently
working in Des Maine: through
Americorp, spoke to rturlentr

AmeriCorps. She said that there
is an aiitirwclfarc, anti-handout senr
titnent these days. and that a Comr
inunity who benefits from
AmcriCorps is “being served, but is
also learning to serve itself."

Although applications for
AmeriCorps are not due until spring,
many are advised to begin early. SeVr
cral students have already begun the
application process.

Grinnell's interest in serving the
community and the world is seen by
the interest aiid participation in these
service organizations

yesterday in the post oﬂice.

Other such organizations which
have have gained many past recruits
from Grinnell include Teach for
America, Learn and Serve, and the
Peace Corps.

AmeriCorps can be reached by
calling the national office at b800-
942-2677 or by visiting their web site
at ltttp:/lwww.cns.gov,

Iilt‘onnation on each ofthe service
organizations listed above can be
found in the Career Devlopment Of-
fice Library on the third floor of
Mcars Cottage.

ing minority presence in Grinnell’s
faculty is the MSIR program. It al-
lows established minority scholars
from other colleges and universities
to conduct a short course of at least
three weeks. The primary goal ofthe
MSIR program is “to bring. . .minor-
ity teacher-scholars, . .to add diver-
sity to curriculum and faculty,” said
Helen Scott. Director of the MSIR
program. However, there are only a
handful of MSIR fellows who have
been offered or attained permanent
positions.

CSMP‘S and MSIR's failure to
promote permanent minority faculty
members may lie in the fact that nei-
ther of these programs obligate the
college to make a comtnitment to hit-
ing, Scholars teach at Grinncll for up
to a year. but are rarely asked to stay,
regardless of their skill or compatr
lbility with Grinnell. Said one stur
dent, ”I’ve had many MSIR profesr
sors and nearly all of them were ex
ccptlonal. The best class I’ve ever
had at Grinneli was taught by an

sion networks, and have produced
four recordings, the newest ofwhich
is scheduled to be released in Janu-
ary of 1998.

“We were really fortunate to get
the band to come here to Grinnell,"
mentioned professor Michael
Cavanagh ofthe English department,
and member of the college’s Public
Events Committee, which played a
key role in getting them here. “They
should be hot 5th

Unfortunately, the group is.not
scheduled to spend very much time
here in Grinnell. They will most
likely arrive and play their music,
with time to have a few private

meals, and then get back on a bus
and leave. No receptions or other
public events have been scheduled,
The band Will announce what they
are to play live from the stage, so the
concert carries with it an air of ex
citing uncertainty, Undoubtedly the
music will be laden with emotion and
energy, as observers ofthe band have
come to characterize them as rou-
tinely displaying.

“The Mingus musicians...keep
searching for themselves in his
lnusic ..so that even posthumously,
Mingus keeps changing," Henloff
added,

If the Grinnell College commur

nity responds to the Mingus Big
Band the way so many before us
have, then most likely the Show will
be a hard one to get into. Charles
Mingus, during an interview with
Hentoff, made a well publicized
comment concerning his music. that
“in my music, I’m trying to play the
truth of what I am. The reason it’s
difficult is because I’m changing all
the time,”

The passion and raw desire heard
in his music continues to warm the
cars of audiences across the country
and the world, thanks in part to the
efforts ofthe Mingus Big Band.

MSIR.“

These programs have been Widely
criticized as “revolving door pro-
grams," which circulate minority
faculty in and out of Grinnell with
no lasting impact.

Gautam Ghosh said that it is par-
ticularly “important that people be
brought in where they have less of-
ten been brought in." He cites the
sciences in particular.

Drighi Burks agrees. He has spo»
ken with the science departments,
and was present at a meeting with
the faculty about the issue of mll’lOl’r
ity representation. Many students,
including Burks, feel that little was
accomplished at the meeting. Burks
will be convinced of action when he
“sees more faculty in the sciences at
Grinncll. . everything else is Just
talk," he said.

Although the college claims to be
working to alleviate minority
underrepresentation, there appears to
be no sense ofurgency in implementr
ing changes. As one professor said,
“Why build a fabulous institution on

Minorities. underrepresented in faculty

‘we’re going to get’ as opposed to
‘we have.’7"

Is it the studean‘ responsibility
to help choose faculty?

Dright Burks ‘99 doesn‘t think so.
He comments that the students’ prir
mary responsibility at Grinnell is to
“get an education.”

Nevertheless, students have felt
obligated to choose new faculty. In
past years, there have been many
large demonstrations asking for the
hiring of minority faculty

In the spring of I995, one demr
onstration was arrangcd in which stun
dents ofcolor dressed in black, taped
their mouths, and stood silent in
classes,

In the spring of 1996, students
again voiced their dissatisfaction
with the lack of minority represen-
tation in the faculty. A student re»

called thatAsian Students inAlliance .

[ASIA], along with many other stu-
dent organizations, felt that the col-
lege had taken little action to incor-
porate Asians into the curriculum.

One of the obvious solutions to this
problem would be to hire more fac-
ulty ofAstan descent, as well as cre—
ating more opportunities to study
Asian and Asian American culture.

Why is a diverse faculty impor-
tant for Grinnell College?

Who has the power to implement
change?

What has the administration done
to show its sincere dedication to-
wards diversity?

These are questions which the stu-
dents. faculty, and administration of
Grinnell College must face as they
work to increase diversity.

Most importantly. the administra-
tion must accept the reality that stu-
dents and faculty ofcolor experience
each day at Grinnell, Only through
these realizations can improvement
occur,

is quite a challenge. especially for the
newer singers, These are the pinnacle
ofa tradition, so it takes a lot from
the singers," he explained.

“We have a ﬁne group this semesr
ter," said Rommercim. “One of the
windfalls ofthe large incoming class
was a big influx of talent."
Rommcreim is also very pleased
with the dedication of the group,
“They are very conscientious and
hardworking It’s tough this time
of year to come to rehearsals when
you‘ve got ten things due and you’re

sick It‘s tough to keep the choir go-
ing full Lili.‘

Another consequence of the inﬂux
of talent and interested students, es-
pecially the large number of inter-
ested women, was the formation of
Musica chlna. Grinnell’s ﬁrst all
female chorus. On Saturday Ihey will
be performing Benjamin Britten‘s

Chenette will be accompanying them

“I hope this will become a perma»

SG/l CORNER

STUDENTI llNlr an NE

The SGA' is currently organizing this year 5 Student Initiatives. Student Initia-
tives are means by which the student body can collectively voice an opinion and
show support for an idea that will improve life at Grmnell College The initiatives
can be about campus academic issues, such as last year' s initiative to add labs to
transcripts. campus life issues, such as the initiative to have more library hours;
or even political issues that do not directly affect student lives, such as the prison
labor initiative

The process is simple.

An initiative. including background, initiative statement and a plan of action,
must ﬁrst be written Written initiatives must then be turned in to the SGA ofﬁces
in the mail basket of the Student Services Coordinator; Jae Hines by 5:00pm. on
Sunday, November 16. loo signatures are required to get the initiative placed on
the ballot, N0 initiative will appear in the Scarlet and Black if it is not lumed in
with I00 signatures by Wednesday. November 19. Beyond publication in the
Scarlet and Black, any publicity for a given initiative is the responsibility or stu—
dents. The initiative will be voted on during the week or thanksgiving Break. the
exact date to be publicized later, Half of the students on campus must vote, and
two thirds ofthose must Vote in favor of the initiative for it to pass. Following the
elections. Jotntrboard will work to accomplish passed initiatives with assistance
from their authors,

Anyone who intends to write an initiative can e-mail [SERVICE] or come during
the Student SerVice Coordinator’s ofﬁce hours to ask questions about exactly
how to write an initiative. Those who already know how to write an initiative can
pick up a signature packet at the time that they turn it in. A copy of these instmc-
[ions is available in the SGA ofﬁces. SGA strongly encourages the campus to
take part in the initiative process and to use it's voice.
