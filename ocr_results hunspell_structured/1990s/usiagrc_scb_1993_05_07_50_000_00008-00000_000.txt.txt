“A little learning is a dangerous thing.”
Alexander Pope

Opinion

 

 

Finally! Kropa’s ﬁrst editorial as S&B Editor:

What we need to learn

”Some people will never learn anything, for this reason, because
they understand everything 100 mm " ﬁAleXnnder Pope

"Grinnellsrutlertts know enough to lhlrtk that they know it all “ —-.Iim Kropu '

HE recent storm ofcontroversy over language houses can teach
Grinnell students and administrators a lesson. One fundamental
assumption that led to the controversy rs misguided and errone-

ous, and it remains to be seen whether either party will realize that.

The admrnistralion should be running this school. not the students.
If both parties had understood this before the ttmc that the controversy
started, then the administration would have been saved the trorrble of
playing the game of ”self-governance“ with SGA, and the time that
students wasted carrying banners and compilrng petitions.

The notion that a student should not be in control ofhts own liberal
eduction, while probably shocking to a majority ofGrinnel] students, is
objectively obvious. A student is notqualified to guide his own educate
tion because, reﬂexively, a student ts uneducated, unfamiliar with
learning. Socrates, the greatest student of all time, expressed this
principle best by recognizing his own ignorance.

Of course, Grinnell students contend that they have nothing to learn:
They know what is best for themselves and should be in charge their own
lives. Perhaps a liberal arts education is not what they needibut they do
need college in order to gcta successfulcareer. Many people’s motivation
to attend Grinnell is apparently not to become educated.

The process ofliberal education is uaining in how to learn. In order
to learn, students must ask questions about life; they should not have all
of the answers.

Imainly blame the adminisu-ation forallowing such corrupted ideas
about liberal education to exist. I agree with Veg that “it is the Grinnell
liberal arts education that makes us so twisted. And I stress the word
Grinnell (Tne Gum, March '93)." Certainly, pretending to let students
dictate administrative policy inhibits their asking any questions. Can
students really be expected to care about learning when they fantasize
that they should be running this sehool?

It is the role of the liberal ans administration to make mles that free
students from such distractions and protect students from themselves.
Modem Grinnell students are even more ignorant than Socrates, because
today ’s ‘libcral education' has led them to believe that they are not. Instead,
arrogance is instilled in students, which entitles them to sabotage the
learning process for the sake of activism. PC-ism is evidence that students
must not be allowed to control their own education because genuine
consideration is replaced by Pavlovian conformity to a conditioned,
predeﬁned way ofthinking. Such thinking proves students incompetence
and rationalizes their laziness, crippling their quest for knowledge.

LAST CHANCE

This is the lust ofﬁcial issueoftheScarletand Black for
this year. However, in all likelihood there will be one
very last, unofﬁcial issue due out early ﬁnals week.
Letters to the Editor wrll be accepeted forthat issue, but
they must be turned in no later than 5:00 pm, next
Friday, May 14 to be considered for publication.

(SOL) and Asian Students in Alli-
ance (ASIA) have their own offices
(formerly the student organrzalion
rooms) which are kept locked. As a
result, one fomm office space is left
for all of the other groups to use.
Needlesstosay,thisofﬁcerscramped.

In principle, the idea of groups
having “safe space" is wonderful. I
firmly believe in it (incidentally, I
also support the proposed houses for
Chalulzim, ASIA, SOL, and ISO),

The problem is that
this principle doesn’t
work in practice. Grin-
nell, by virtue of being a
smallschool,haslimrted
resources. We have at
least 60 student groups.
Ofcoursc, notall ofthcse
groups require (brdcsire)
“safe space" but most
would probably enjoy
more ofﬁce space.

I am left wondering about groups
liketheStudentAdvocares(cnsishotJinc
for survivors of sexual assault/harass
ment). Currently, there is no set place
where survivors of assault can be met
irnmodiamly and in private.

Irccognize that ASIA and SOL
have advisers who needanofftceand

that these groups petitioned exte
sively before having their demant
met. Sluderttinputfromothergroup
however, was never solicited nor co
sidcrcd; there was no forum or way
voice concerns.

The last thing I want to do is
pll groups against each other.

“People just react. In the proces

On a broader level, talking abo
“multiculturalism” at Grinnell is li
walking on egg shells. I support tl
