From humble beginnings in 1970.
Earth Dayhas grown to an event cel-
ebrated by over 200 million in 41
countries. In recent years the Envi-
ronmental Action Group (BAG) has
worked Within the confines of
Grinnell College to increase student
involvement in this nationally recog»
nized event. since its inception circa
1988 EAG (known as the Environ»
mental Interest Group—BIG until
1992) has always celebrated Earth
Day but not to the extent that it has
in recent years. Last year's Earth
Weekend in celebration ofEarth Day
XVI was a May event geared to al-
low as many people to participate as
possible. Events included a litter

Pagans prepare for May Day

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Features Editor

There are four great festivals ofthe
Pagan Celtic year. and one of these
is swtftly approaching ~ May Day,
the beginning of summer on the mod-
ern Witch’s calendar.

The old Celtic name for May Day
is Beltane (in its most popular An-
glicized forth), which is derived from
the Irish Gaelic “Eealtaine” or the
Scottish Gaelic “Bealtuinn”. mean»
ing “Bel»ﬁre". the ﬁre of the Celtic
god of light.

History tells that 'by‘ Celtic reckon»
ing, the actual Beltane celebration
began on sundown of the preceding
day, April 30. Sundown was the
proper time for Druids to kindle the
great Bel»ﬁres on the tops of the near»
est beacon hill. These “need-ﬁres"
had healing properties, and sky~clad
Witches would jump through the
flames to ensure protection. Fre»
quently, cattle would be driven be»
tween two such bonﬁres and. on the
next day, they would be taken to their
summer pastures.

Other May Day customs include
walking the circuit ofone‘s property,
repairing fences and boundary mark
ers, processions of chimney-sweeps
and milk maids. archery tournae
merits. morris dances, sword dances,

feasting. and maidens bathing their -

faces in the dew of May morning to

retain their youthful beauty.

In the words of Witchcraft writers
Janet and Stewart Farrar, the Beltane
celebration was principally a time of
“...unashamed human sexuality and
fenility." Such associations include
the obvious phallic symbolism of the
Maypole and riding the hobby horse.
Some May Day customs seem vtrtu-
ally identical to the old Roman feast
of ﬂowers, the Floriala, three days
of unrestrained sexuality which be-
gan at sundown April 28th, and
reached a crescendo on May lst.

There are other, even older. asso-
ciations with May lst in Celtic mye
thology. According to the ancient
Irish “Book of Invasions", the first
settler of Ireland, Partholan, arrived
on May 1st; and it was on May lst
that the plague came which_ de-
stroyed his people. Years later, the
Tuatha De Danann were conquered
by the Milesians on May Day.

For most people, May lst is a great
holiday of flowers, Maypoles, and
greenwood frivolity. The Pagan Dis-
cussion Circle here at Grinnell typi-
cally celebrates this ancient holiday
with dancing and a Maypole. and
discussions open to the public. Due
to time constraints, the S & B is un-
able to print a schedule of this year’s
planned events, but if apprOpriate
weather occurs, expect to see color-
ful remembrances of pagan tradition
on campus this May Day.

Pipe cleaner madness to return to campus May 5

BY LINDSEY HAGY
Staff Writer

Grinncll College is a few weeks
away from celebrating a holiday that
is as distinctly Grinnellian as the train
tracks that run through the middle of
campus and the Grinnell Sesquicen.
tennial bottled water » National Pipe-
Cleaner Day. Listed on the wall of
the third floor Burling washroom as
the number one enigma at Grinnell
and marked by bright sculptures and
fuzzyjewelry, the fourth annual cel-
ebration of this holiday at Grinnell
will take place throughout campuson

‘ Monday May 5. “ ‘ ‘

Each year on National Pipe»Cleaner
Day, pipe-cleaners are distributed
throughout campus at dining halls,
computer labs. the post office, and
by students acting for the Pipe-
Cleaner National Committee. Stu-
dents and staff are then at liberty to
create whatever they will with these
slender, malleable. fuzzy tools of the
imagination. Remnants of this holia
day are found throughout the year in
dorm rooms, on backpacks. and

through the stories told by upper»
classmen to first years.

'This holiday was brought to Grin-
nell by Senior- Katix‘ Crawford but
has become a possession of the en-
tire campus. This is the third school
to which Crawford has introduced
this holiday. Although this cclebra»
tion has been a success at all three
schools, Crawford said that it has
been most colorfully celebrated at
Grinnell. ”Grinnell students are Just
amazing. They make such cool
stuff,” she commented. Crawford
and the Pipe-Cleaner National Plan—
ning Committee actively promoted
the holiday because, “It makes
people laugh. Everybody makes re»
ally. really amazing sculptures, ac»
cessories, and things. It’s really
amazing to see everybody break
loose and play with the pipe»clean-
ers."

Cleaner National Planning Commit»

school as Crawford, Storm Lake

High School. and carried on the tra
dition there as she will again at Grin-
nell next year ttflcr Crawford has
graduated. Crawford says of Russell.
“She is very thoughtful and comes
up with it lot of good ideas." Ale
though Russell, Crawford. and the
others who initiated this tradition at
Storm Lake High School have gradur
ated, the holiday lives on. The Com»
mittee hopes that the same will hold
true at Grinnell. Grccn recalls her
strong commitment to this holiday as
forming during her sophomore year
when pipe-cleaners saved her life.
By actively promoting the holiday
through pastels. radio catis and wtth
SGA funding, the committee has
made National pipec1eaner buy
something that Students look forward
to each year This ycnr tlte number
of pipe-cleaners distributed will in-
crease froin almost 9000 to 12000,
which means there Will be about
three pipe cleaners for every student
and staff member at Grinnell. The
pipe»clcancrs are bought wholesale
from Fibre Craft materials in Niles,
Illinois.

Grinncll students have a variety of
attitudes towards National Piper
Cleaner Day. Sophomore Emily
Morse said of the holiday, “I just
think it’s cool making little shapes
during class and giving them to your
friends.“ Similarly, Freshman Liz
Burton said in antictpation of her ﬁrst
celebration of this holiday. “it’s silly,
but good silly. It kind of makes you
reevaluate the things you always take
for granted » like pipeecleaners.
However, JuniorBen Rodriguezhad
a different attitude. “It's just a day
with a bunch of wires and cotton.
SGA wasted too much moneyon it,"
he said. . ‘

The following question has heen‘
asked of National Pipe Cleaner Day,
next to the Top Ten Enigmas at Grin»
nell list on the'wall of Burling
Library's third floor bathroom,
“What the hell is this crap all about
7" In answer to this, the Committee
says they promote the holiday at
Grinncll “so that others might expe-
rience the wildjoy and abandon that
a tiny wii’e wrapped in yellow fuzz
can bring to one’s heart.
