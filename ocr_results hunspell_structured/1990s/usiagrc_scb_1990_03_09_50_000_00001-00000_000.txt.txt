actively sought the opening of a
women’s center prior to her death.

Cleveland Smokers
Climb Up to Light Up

By Craig Wacker

Cleveland Hall has recently
changed its smoking policy to
designate the third ﬂoor lounge as
the only smoking lounge in the
dorm. Since all lounges in the
dorm were previously smoking
lounges, the alteration has created
controversy throughout Cleveland
Hall,

According to Jon Wentzel. a
three-year Cleveland resident, this
controversy has caused a problem
with dorm unity. “lt’sapain tn the
ass,” he said. Dorm unity was not
the only thing affected by the
change in policy.

Christine Weber, a four-year
Cleveland residentcmphastaed that
the lounge had traditionally been a
smoking lounge. The change has
“caused smoking in the halls." she
said.

“It’s disrupted the lounge usage,"
Andy Coghill added.

Non-smoker also reacted to the
change ofpolicy. “lcnjoy walking
into the lounge and being able to
breathe." Said Melissa Koch.

Rachel Swanson also noted that
the previous lounge situation \\ -
uncomfortable to non-smokers.

“it‘s intimidating to walk into a
lounge and ask smokers to put out
their cigarettes.”

According to Laura Kirk-Clark,
RA. for Main and Cleveland
halls, the change was carried out
by the rules set down in the hand-
book. The necessary percentages

for both petition and vote were
present to institute a change.

Some smokers allege that the
vote was confusmg. Others clalm
they voted for the proposal only
because they wanted to take what
they could get. Stillothers empha»
size the ineffectiveness of the
change, believrng that nonrsmok-
ers who didn‘t use the lounge be-
fore the change still don’t.

Overall, many smokers rctnain
angry with the present situation
and its infringement upon smok~
era. “Smokcrs are not necessarily
petty and disorderly," Wenlzel
said.
