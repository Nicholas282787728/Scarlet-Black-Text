Saturday at William Penn,

weather permitting. It will be the ﬁrst
opportunity to see both a new coach and
a fairly new team in action

For Coach Ttltl Holllbmtgh, work-
ing at Grinir 11 is not too different from
previous posiLions. Hollthaugh came to

The coach has introduced a “much
better attitude titan prevrous years." said
Team Captain lan Carlson.

But players aren't the only ones
enthusrastic about the season.

“We‘ve got some good young ex-
perience," said Hollthztugh, reten-rng to
the team's nine new players.

Captain Ian Shoemaker agreed that
the team has "got good talent" in its new
players.

In addition to the llcw members, the
group has erghtrctunring players to ltel p

Particularly noted were Team Captains
J rm Hall, Carlson. and Shoemaker.

“[Carlson] is potentially one of U16
best Division Lt] players that I've seen,"
said Hollibauah. "He’s a great athlete
and a great student."

Holtibaugh also noted that the team
has “solid pitching."

Overall, the outlook for this season
is very optimistic. Improvement on last

Strong returning members give golfteam good prospects for coming season

OLF # the sport of sober
well»dressed young men
and women making neat

putts and drives accurate to the centir
meter. While this may be a good
description of the PGA. golf at
Gnnnell is a lot more fun.

The men's golf team. with re-
turning letter winners Jason Sawyer,
Neil Goodspeed, Matt Wagner.
Derek Fimmen and Marc Janssen, is
anticipatingasuccessfulseason,and
maybe even a shot at the conference
title.

The team's goals for this year
include playing consistently, imr
provingoverallscoringaveragesand
winning at least one or two tournar
merits. Their recent history has
shown them to be lnore than capable
of this.

“The pasttwoseasons have been
two of the best in the past several
years," said junior Goodspecd.

The spring of ’94 saw the golfr
ers take third in both their division
and the conference. Another high-
light ofthe season was a third place
ﬁnish out of 17 teams at the Illinois
Wesleyan tournament.

Led by ,

Wagner’s 75, the Pioneers earned a
scoreof3lZandedgedouttwoteams
thathad qualified for nationals. The
best individual performance of the
year was a74 recorded by Sawyer at
Knox.

Flmmcn and Goodspeed were
named to the a11»conference team
last season. However, learn memr
hers all see themselves as equals.

“Each person led the team in
some rounds We don’t rely on any
one person," said Wagner.

This season lasts fornine weeks.
Duringthat tune the men will play in
nine or ten tournaments, including
twornvitaiionalswnh highcrranked
schools, and several tournaments
with conference foes. Players said
that conference competition is close
this car, and that many Learns are

capable of wtnrnng the title. They
hope to finish first or second in the
league.

Perhaps the most cxcitingcvent
for the golf team will be its annual
spring break trip to San Antonio to
play in a predominantly Division 1
tournament there The competition
is much stronger than what the team
usually faces and they are never con~
tenders foratitle, but the experience
provides good practice.

“We get to play on really good
courses and play against excellent
golfers," said Sawyer.

After the regular season ends,
around 75 teams are chosen to come
pete iii the national tournament By
virtue ofits location alone, it is difr
frcult tor-Grinncli to qualify. Teams
are chosen partly on the basis of
