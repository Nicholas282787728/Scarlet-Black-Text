This past Monday night, - ,

was organized by Satan Hallas
‘97, also sought to propose meac
sures to alleviate, ifnot solve, the
problems racism presents.

The program began with a
number of questions posed by Ed
Brands ‘96, the moderator of the
discussion. Brands forced audi—
encc members to think about the
assumptions that are made in day
today interactions with others,
and to what extent these assump—
tions may tacitly be fostering rac»
ism.

Fullas, whose controversial

protests and talks last spring,

the position he tool; last year.
Pallas added how his experiences

also urged people to look at issues

because it is impossible to com—

Although no consensus was
reached as to what concrete mea—
sures should be taken in order to
increase overall race awareness,
there was a definite affirmation

All those who spoke our ex—
pressed the need for careful

ing with issues ofi‘acc, typified by
Kurzman's suggestion that people
write down their thoughts and
feelings about racism in aiournal.

Many noted, however, that
personal thought and reﬂection
must cvcntuain lead to pctsonai

racism if we wish to eradicate it
from the college community. In
short, some students who attendc
ed the discussion believe that peo—
ple must make the fight against
racism a way of life rather than
Just a pattern of thought.

Pointingoutthe need forpctr
sonal involvement in the fight
against racism, Tapia expressed a
popular theme of the evening‘s
comments by saying that each

individual who does nothing in
the face of racist acts, however
subtle, is responsible for the racc
ism that exists at Grinnell. She
described herself as an anti—racist
racist who, havrn g acknowledged
her own subtle racism, must daily
confront stereotypes and preju/
dices which have bccn ingrained
in her way of thinking by main—
stream American culture.

Walters decried the fact that
it took a monumental event such
as the Los Angeles riots to stimuc
late discussion on issues ofracc in
her suburban high school, exem—
plifying the fear expressed nuc
merous times that evening that
“White America” is uncomfort»
able discussing issues of race. A
number of people suggested ways
to break through this uneasiness
such as an all—white forum to talk
candidly about racism and how to
deal with it. Froycn also urged
people to “open their eyes" and
take responsibility for the racism
in and around them.

raises lst Amendment concerns

According to David Wilson
of The Chronicle, the provision
would update the 19th-century
Comstock Act banning lewd
materials and medical informa—
tronothuipmcntrclarcdtoabor—
tion.

The CDA places intctnet
communication under the Strictt
or regulation of broadcast Jourt
nalism instead of the more ler
nient publishing magazine rcgu«
lation. Fines of up to one huiv
dred thousand dollars and two
years in jail can be imposed on
anyone who by means of a tele—
communications dcvrcc produc—
es or makes available any obscene

communication in any form,
Theoretically, this could even
make sexual comments in clecc
tronic mail subiect to prosecu—
tion.

Computer systems operators
like Grinncll College can also be
held liable under the CDA. This
is where the CDA carries its force
because it can impose fines on
Web servers and place their sy5c
rem administrators in jail. Most
computer servers would then be
obligated by financial necessity
to police their systems for indo
cent material.

GrinnellCollegcsystcmsop—
crators arc attcmpting to limit

the impact of the act on the col»
lege computer system. John
Stone, MathLAN administrator
said “we certainly don’t have any
interest in implementing the ac t‘s
provisions until it has been tested
in law.” Bill Francis, head of
Computer Services, added that if
the acrrcmains law hewould “take
the text ofrhc act to the Grinnell
attorney to provide the maximum
amount of freedom possible."
