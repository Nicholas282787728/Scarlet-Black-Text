Grinnell tells his story

By Gareth Fisher

You have probably swn him walla
illg around town or walking around
campus, and you certainly know ltim
if you have spent any significant
amount of time ill the Forum Game
Room, You probably know him only
as Grinnell. With ltis snowy white
beard and wire-rimmed glasses, he
more closely resembles Santa Claus
than an expert pool player, yet I‘m
told he is notbad with a cue when hc
gets achartee to play. But who is he,

and why has come to play pool with '

students who weren’t alive when the
building they play in was built?

His name is Grinnell Dunham. He
is 83 years old,and he and his falnily
before him have been inextricably
intertwined with this town since
Joshua B. Grinnell became the first
white person to settJe here 137 years
ago. Hts maternal grandmother was
1.13. Grinnell's second cousin.

Dunham himself grew up on a
farm outside of Grinnell and went to
high school in town. He remembers
com in g here to see free movies in the
old ARH auditorium, before he him»
self attended the college as a student
in 1930. He met his wife when she
worked as a research librarian at the

A college. Outofhis ﬁve children,one
later attended Grinnell and wenton to

beanursein Fuirbanks,Alaska. Later
on. when Dunham owned his own
farm, he grounded up ht‘y into pellets
and solditas protein for animals He
enlisted the help of students to make
the hay. After he retlred from fan‘nr
mg, Dunhdtn started to come here for
recreation and he SLlll does now.

Dunltam remembers a time when
Burling,tlteFonim,theSctenee Buildr
iltg. the PEC and the residence halls
did not exist.

The major change Dunham has
noticed in the college over the years '
theproliferation ofdiffercntreligions

and cultural groups, compared to a ,

relativelyhomogeneousstudentbody
earlier on, when the college was ale
fililttetl with the Congregational
Church.

Dunhdtn also recalls memorable
events tn the college’s history such as
the Vietnam war protests and the year
when classes were canceled before
the end of the year ln order to cool
risingtensions on campus. He agrees
withtheideathntthccampuswasltke
a bomb waiting to explode, and is
quick to observe that many other colr
lcges did explode, but he felt at the
time that classes should have contin-
ued because the college had a con
tract with the students to finish their
education,

tensions are nothing new. He recalls
a time when the farmers who rented
places out to students felt cheated
when the college built on—campus
residence halls. He believes, howV
ever, that the vast majority of the
town sees the college as an asset and
onlyafcw“blgmouths”andgangsof
youths feel otherwise.

Dunhaln regularly shows up to
play pool and “chit-chat” He also
shows upto the occasional volleyball
game, like last Saturday ’3 tournament.

He said he is involved with the
college because it runs in his family,
and added “They say ‘go in the navy,
see the world'. I come to the college
and see your world."

Interns see law in action

By Julie Gard

Through work with mentally ill
inmates and the victims of domestic
violence, Mollie Conner and Tim

of indigent peoples.” They shared
their summer work experiences dur
ing the last Monday's Rosenfleld Inr

Hyde referred to his first couple of

“very intimidating.” As part of his

person wishing to go to court.

Hyde found that “support on the

much to do with an individual’s
chances for freedom. l-le contrasted

Shaneand Tonyareon the football
‘ team. Dean, a friend of theirs who is
_ not on the team, sat next to them.
After them came Chris and Debbie,
‘ two girls who had also been sitting in

In the short time I had with them,
‘ I quickly came to understand that the
v students of Grinnell High School are

school. Every person I talked to, both

paying for college, SATs 7 all the
‘ things that every current college stu»
dent worried about in high school.
01‘ course, there are differences,
‘ Everyone i talked to does believe to
some extent that most people at this

Walking through the streets oftlown-
* town Grinnell, they can easily tell
college people apart from the rest of
the community.
“Well, most of ’cm dress weird,
1 and a lot oftimcs they don't seem all
that bright,” said Tony. Pointing to
‘ Shane, he continued. “You remem-
ber last week when we were driving

through town. and those two college
kidswere justsittingon thecurb, with
their feet out in the middle of the
street." He turned back to me and
said, “It just seems like a lot of them
just don’t have any common sense."

Chris noticed otherdi fferencﬂ be-
tween townspeople and college stu-
dents,

“I’d say Grinnell is a very conser-
vative town. It always shocks people
when two guys are holding hands
when they walk down the street," she
said. “I’m not sure what it ls, but the
common idea of most of the college
people is that they're all homosexual
and dress funny."

understanding, however. Tony and
Dean complained about the stereo-
type college students seem to have
towards the town: it is a typical small
town that doesn‘t like outsiders or
people that act out of the ordinary.

“I really don’t think that’s true,”
said Dean “We try togive everybody
achance, Wemtghtlabelsomepeople
if we don‘t talk to them just to make
ajoke, but that’s usually not what we
really think. We'll poke fun, but we
don’t mean anything by it,"

When the students ofboth schools
get together in anything more than

casually passing one another on the
street, most of these stereotypes
quickly fall away. Shane, Dean and
Tony all talked about going to the
Physical Education Complex [0 play
basketball and how they usuallywind
up playing against college students.
“We really have a lot of fun,” said
Tony.

The understanding between the
groups goes deeper than basketball.
Many of the students‘ parents work at
thecollege,atjobs ranging from food
service to professors.

“Yeah, my mom has worked at
Cowles for about eight years, She
thlnks a lot of the people there are
pretty weird, but she's also come to
know and be friends With a lot of

lasked them what the main source
of the violence is between Grinnell
youth and college students. They
agreed that any current acts of vio-
lenee are probably done by older
members of the community, those
who are out of high school and have
remained living in Grinnell.

“None of the violence these days
is coming from high school kids,”
said Dean. “There was a group that
graduated about four years ago from
here, who would go out a lot and go

Hyde would advise anybody in-

to look into this internship.

“I spent one semester in Spain,
and didn’t even come close to speak-
ing [Spanish] as much as I did in
Washington," said Conner while dis»
cussing her internship work with
Ayuda, Inc. She aided the organiza-
tion in providing legal services to the
Hispanic community of the District
ofColombia. primarily tllrough work
with battered women

When victims came to Ayuda for
help, Conner spoke to them in their
native Spanish about their situation
and history of abuse, She explained
options, and helped women to obtain
protection orders. Conner described
the imponance this legal protection
held for each of her clients: “This
paper made him not have the right [to
abuse her], as if before he did."

Conner views their “deeply en-
trenched" beliefs in male dominance
as these women's “own greatest en-
emy." She cited one case in which a
woman‘s husband had beaten her and
threatened her wim a knife. At ﬁrst,
the woman was firm about taking
action,butgmduallyher resolve weak-

was living with her husband again.

mized the cultural barriers," stated
Conner. She emphasized that money
and connections “mean nothing, if a
woman doesn‘t have the menmliry to
carry out [her escape from an abusive
situation].”

in spite of discouraging cases,
Conner'sintemship“definilelydidn’t

ened" by participation in an aspect of
the law that often worked to the ad-
vantage of disadvantaged people.
