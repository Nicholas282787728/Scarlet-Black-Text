Entertainment for Peace Day: De La Soul...

By Jessica Moon

This year, Peace Day features
the ﬁrst rap act ever to come to
Grinnell, one of the few, in fact, to
venture into Iowa. But De La Soul
is adventurous in other ways. too.
The group‘s members--Masse,
Trugoy the Dove, and Posdnuos--
are hardly your typical rappers.
They have been called the "hip-
pies of hip-hop" Their style has
been described as "psychedelic
rap," and they have been hailed as
one of themost innovativebands
of the last decade.

The Day-Glo daisies and peace
signs on the cover of their ﬁrst
album, "3 Feet High and Rising,"
tell you what De La Soul is all
about. And the group’s peaceful
message doesn't stop. there” in
their music, they manipulateme
typical topics of rappers~sex,
drugs, violencewand turn them
into a peaceful message the com

bats everything from sexism to
racism to AIDS.

In "Ghetto Thang," a tune on "3
Feet High," the trio attacks gang
violence: "Killing fee off your
brother man has quickly been

L”Ayb[1by' is brought into a
worldbf pits, and ifit could
have talked that soon in the

”Say No Go”

 

adopted as the master plan." On
another track, "Say No Go," they
dealwith the harshreahuesofdnigs
and teen pregnancy: "A baby is
brought intoa world of pits, and if
itcould have Ialked that soon in the
delivery room it would have asked
the nurse for a hit.The reason for
this: themotheris ajerk, excuse me

junkiema way of today"

Like De La Soul's message,
theirmusical stylealsobreaksaway
from the traditional rap stereotype.
The trio hasattraclcdmany new lis-
tcncrs to therap sccnewithawidely
appealing style that samples from
the songs oiour childhood: Steely
Dan, Turtles. Hall and Oales and
Bob Dylan.

For De La Soul, the '90’s are the

"D.A.I.S.Y. Age": 3 time when we ‘
should all look to "Da Inner Soul ,

Y'all" in order to bring ourminds to
a higher plane and express our
individuality. This is the heart of
the De La Soul messagewlhe peace
movementat the guts

De La Soul‘s message is serious,
but their style is far from dull.
This is a big-name band that will

‘bring big funtoabig day. So

Soul on sunny MacField, April
28. Join the band in Darby if it
