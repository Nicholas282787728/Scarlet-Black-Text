To the editor.

Frankly, black South Africans
are NOT obligated to answer to
anyone about how to conduct our
own struggle. South Africa is our
birthright Wedo notneedtoexplain
anddefend our motives andactionsr
The destruction of apartheid is long
overdue, and countless innocent
victims have been murdered by the
terrorist apartheid regime.
Therefore, “if we have to go back to
thebushtoflghtthewhiteman," we
will do so. Mike Washhum, Otto
Pohl, James Kiyan and many others
who hold similar views will have to
accept that fact What right does
any unoppressed person, especially
one who may be an oppressor, have
to dictate to theoppressed how they
should overcome their their
oppression?

However, we feel that the racist
and reactionary assertions of
Washbum, Pohl and Kiyan must be
denounced. These individuals have
misguided views about the

unfolding revolution in South
Afrieaand aboutNelson Mandela's
role in our struggle It is apparent
from. their arguments that the
propaganda of the monstrous
imperialist US, government and
its racist and bigoted agencies has
fooled some people including the
individuals mentioned above We
hope this response will convey our
feelings and opinions about the
previousarticles,aboutourongoing
struggle to liberate South Africa
and also challenge the racist
overtones of the previous articles

In 1961, Nelson Mandela and
Joe Slovo founded Umkhonto
weSizwe out of necessity. The
sociopolitical conditions in South
Africa compelled them to consider
the option of anan‘ned insurrection
against the apartheid regime. The
A.NlCl had tried on numerous
occasions, through peaceful mass
demonstrations and campaigns, to
convince the governmenttoabolish
the atrocious system. All these
effons were futile. Instead. the
genocide of innocent people
continued. Consequently, black
SoutltAfricans,throughUmkhonto.
struck back. Therefore. the

foundation of Umkhonto was a
reaction against the terror of

apartheid; Umkhonto was formed
after the fact.
Furthennore,thesuggestionthal
we should model the new South
Africa after U.S. “democracy" is
absurd. The concept of true
democracy has been misused in this
country, The present conditions
and struggles of NativeAmericans,
African-Americans and other
people of color testify to this. Their

struggles expose U.S. democracy
asasharn. TheU.S. government's
understanding of democracy will
notbc our model; we will forge our
own based on the prevailing
conditions in S.A.

In addition, Mandela reiterated
our opinion about the enemies of
the U.S. government during his
tour of lhiscountry. He stated quite
frankly Lhat the enemies of the US.
government “are not our enemies."
In summary, we still embrace Fidel
Castro, whose volunteer soldiers
mercilessly defeated the white
South African troops at Cuito
Cuanevale, Angola in 1988; “we
salute Yassar Arafat, our comrade
in arms;” we acknowledge
Muammar Qadafﬁ as an ally in
struggle. We also salute our
relentless supponers. who in the
face of reactionary propaganda,
continttelostandbyusasweattempt
to rid South Africa of the gigantic
monster: apanheid. South Africa
will be free “by any means
necessary."

You get your freedom by letting
your enemy know that you’ll do
anything to get your freedom: then
you‘ll get it. It's the only way
you‘ll get it

Response by GCCS

To the editor.

Notice on the Carnegie Terminal
Room Wall:

“The Carnegie Laser Printer

This printer’s name is
CTRLN03

This is NOT the same as
CARNLN03 (which is the
secretary's printer).

If you sent a paper to the
secretary’s ofﬁce, it is highly
unlikely that you will be able
to get it back. Please reprint to
CTRLNOJ. You may apologize
to the secretary (for interrupting
her). to the Environmental
Interest Group (for contributing
to paper wastage), to Grinnell
College Computer Services (for
increasing paper and toner
costs), and to your parents (for
raising tuition by raising
operating costs) at a later date.
Thank You,"

I feel that this is a very
inappropriate and hypocritical
way of informing students that
they have made a mistake.
CARNLN03 is not even an
option in the regular PRN
program, which means that the
only student jobs sent to it are
from first-year students or the
few upperclass dlehards who
have figured out how to use
WordPerfect.

In addition, the WordPerfect
program does not give you a
description of the different printers
listed in the print menu, so how
does one know that CI‘RLNOS is
even in Carnegie? Titus, if a paper
is sent to the Carnegie secretary’s
printer, I feel that it is an honest
mistake, and I have a feeling that
most students who have done so

Students to End Apartheid Claims Washburn and
Letters Ignored Basic Conditions in South Africa

To the editor.

Due to the recent editorial
comments, in both the column by
Mike Washbum and in the letters
that responded to it, members of
StuderlLs to End Apanheid felt the
need to respond to some of the
concerns voiced about the ANC
and Nelson Mandela.

When Washbum speaks of the
high wages of blacks in South
Aﬁ-icarelativetotheleastdeveloped
black African counuies, he is no
doubt telling the truth. But
Washbum forgets the discrimi-
natory wage scales, the exclusion
from specific jobs, the denial of
worker beneﬁts and the use of IDs
and work permits, all of which
systematically deny blacks and
other South Africans equal righm.
Generally, blacks in South Africa
hold jobs which thedominant group
does not want While comparison

of the per capita income of black
South Africans with the per capita
income of rest of Africa is useful.
we must also compare the income
and the living conditions of black
and colored South Africans with
thoscofwhitepeoplelivingin South
Africa.

Otto Pohl‘s remarks are
similarly misleading. Pohl
regards Nelson Mandela, and
perhaps the African National
Congress, as an “organizer of
murder and terror." WhatPohl does
not understand is that apanheid, a
system inherently violent. is not
one that is likely to be brought
down by solely peaceful means
Under the apartheid rule in South
Africa. police torture, arrests
without charges, detention without
trials and for alleged political
offenses, use of lethal force,
banning, forced separation of
families, curfews and disap-

pearances have been routines To
counteractuieheavilyarmedtacttcs
of the South African government, it
is obvious that the ANC felt that
violence was necessary to their
struggle. Perhaps their violence is
notjustiflable, but when you take a
look at other political struggles
throughout the world, the ANC is
certainly not alone in resorting to
violence.

Finally, in response to the
allegation that Mandela’s prison
term was spentin comfort. there are
certainaspects of imprisonmentthat
make it universally harsh. The fact
is that more than 25 years is along
time to be in prison, to have one's
voice censored or to be unable to
paricipale in the freedom struggle.
Itshouldbcnored,too,thatlvfandela
was moved to relatively com-
fortable quarters after he had been
sick: itis not hard to assume thatthe
South African government did not

want to beregarded responsible for
his death, As well, one has to re-
membcrthatothcrimpomntleaders
in the antirapanheid movement did
not fare well in prison. including
another ANC leader, Stephen E iko,
who was killed while in a South
African prison.

The struggle for freedom in
South Africa is a struggle for self
determination, for the right to self4
destiny and democratic living.
South Africa is a country that is in
need of rebinh. not reform. Indeed.
the recently opened lines of
communication between the AN C
and the South African government
is just one of the first steps toward
the total dismanuingof the apartheid
systeml Likeitornot. theANC,led
by Nelson Mandela, will play a
very imponant, and necessary, role
in the future of South Africa.

Students to End Apartheid (SEA)

would agree with me. But this sign
ischastisingpeopleasit they meant
to send their paper to a faculty
printer. The students of this college
deserve to be treated with a tilde

' more respect than this.

That much aside, I can’t believe
that computer services would be
complaining about paper waste in
this situation Shall we count how
much paper and toner are wasted
everyday on the Darhy 202 laser
printer? For EVERY job sent to
that printer, it spews out a useless
flag sheet so that you'll be sure to
recognize your own paperl And
each one of those uses almost as
much ink as a normal typed page.

Finally, apologizing to your
parents for raising tuition because
you sentapapcrtothe wrongprinter
isahsolutelyridiculous. and [really
question the logical abilities of this
sign‘s author.

Overall, GCCS is an excellent
resource and the do a good job of
keeping this college on line and
productive, I hope that they do not
want the kind of reputation that ﬁlls
kind of sign will give them. In the
future, they could try to be a little
more informative and a little less
condescending when labeling their
printers.

Editor‘s note: The sign in question
was not an official GCCS sign and
was removed soon after discovery.

A Warning
About Rape
and Abuse

To the editor.

As both a member of the I-HZC
(harassment education committee)
and the sexual abuse survivors
support group, I would like to
remind people the deflnltion of
amp”

Ifs/he says noATANY TIME it
IS tape This is both campus policy
and Iowastalelaw. This means that
even if you are naked in bed with
someone, even if you are “fooling
around” at the time, if s/he says
“no," “stop,“ “that‘s enough," “I’ve
changed my mind," etc. you need
to stop. Being drunk is no excuse.
Having had sex with this person
before is no excuse. We all canand
must control ourselves.

Unfortunately, this letter does
not come out of nowhere; there are
too many new potential members
of my support group after the past
two weeks. Date rape IS a crime.
Date rape is RAPE. Please, let's
stop adding statistics here at
Grinnell,
