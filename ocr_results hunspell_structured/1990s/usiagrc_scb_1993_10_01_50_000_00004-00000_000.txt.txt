Dance Troupe
Has Full Year
Scheduled

By Jennifer Prusak

HILE the restofus have
been adjusting to our
new schedules and

starting to crack down on our stud—
ies, the Grinnell DanceTroupe has
been hard at work.

The highest level dancing
company here at Grinnell, the
Troupe rehearses extensively.
meeting four aftemoonsa week for
two hours to perfect theirjazz and
modem dancing, as well as their
choreography skills.

The Dance Troupe performs
several times each year. An inforr
mal performance is always held in
theForum during lhefirstsemesler
(information on this performance
will be published as soon as it is
available). They have several other
informal performances throughout
the year, with the grand ﬁnale be-
ing their annual spring perfor-
mance.

Becoming a member of the
Dance Troupe is a fairly difficult
process. Mrs. Voenman. the die
rector of the Troupe, organizes a
three-day dance workshop open to
all interested students in the fall.
Auditions for the Troupe follow,
and thirteen or fourteen students
are selected. Members tend to be
returning students with consider
able experience; this year, how
ever, the group has six new stu-
dents, a comparatively large num-
her.

The first semester is used
mostly to work on technique and
bring everyone up to thesame level;
the second semester is when most
of their performing takes place.

Whatmakes the DanceTroupe
hereatGrlnnelldifferentfrom other
pcrfonninggroups is the emphasis
it places on studean' own inven-
tions. “They’re not always doing
my choreography,” says Mrs.
Voertman. “They're doing their
own.” Students in the Dance
Troupearealwaysmtegratingtheir
own routines into whatever they
are learning. Performances rou~
Lincly feature a large proportion of

CASTING a substantial rep-
B enoireandatumultuous(al-

belt brtet) history that would
make any sclfrrespccting pro pop
band green with envy. Liquid Pearl
has returned to Grinnell College this
year armed with enough direction
and ambition to ensure their Continr
ued success—even if it isn’t on this
particular campus.

Although they very much en—
joyed this month‘s acoustic perfor-
lnance at Bob's Underground, gctr
ting their songs out to a wider audi-
ence is currently top priority for Arlo
Leach (guitars) and bandmates Dave
Collman (keyboards, vocals). Nathan
Brant (lwd vocals), Aaron Kassover
(bass,hannonica).andlenRose("rhe
best drummer I've ever met.“ says
Leach).

”We recorded a demo tape
two weekends ago, and are now
waiting to get the finalmix back.”
said Leach in a recent interview.
Engineered by the Scarlet &
Black’s own Tom Zlabinger, the
tape will accompany a still-tn»

eventually be sent to other coir

“We all have different inﬂur

several of Liquid Pearl’s earliest
songs.
The group is split in its post-

bers may change In the future," says
Collman. For now, however, all in-
volved are simply “having fun mule

Leach says he is sure Liquid
Pearl‘s sound will evolve over the
years,butinpreciselywhatdlrecljon,
he is not certain. “In general, bands
progress. We‘re not really into {ole

naturally."

The level of competitiveness
Grinnell campus bands feel toward
one another is low, according to
Collman, in spite of the image Battle
of the Bands might present. “I'm
happy to see all the new bands pope
ping up. It’s nice to see diversity.
Competition is not a big deal to us;
we JuSL enjoy playing together.”

“Weworkl’eallyhardatwhatwe

ate those who support us by coming
to our shows.”
