Woodland trails, restored prairie
better access and an interpretive center
are among the improvements proposed
for the former Camp Fire Girls camp
west ofGrinnell, now the Sugar Creek
Audubon Nature Sanctuary.

The Tallgmss Prairie Audubon So-
ciety has released a draﬁ master plan
for the 49-acre preserve. A public meet-
ing is set for 7 pm. Wednesday, Feb.
25, in the meeting room at Stewart
Library in Grinnell. Discussion will
follow a slide-illustrated presentation
of the plan.

According to the plan, the property
will be managed to preserve it as a
high-quality natural area and to make
it a community resource for nature
enjoyment, education and research.
To accomplish those objectives, the
plan proposes a number of improve-
ments, some of which will be com-
pleted this year and others over the
longer term. .

Foot trails to be marked

One proposed project forthis spring
isto mark a small networkoffoot trails
leading to some of the more interesting
natural features of the propeny. An
interpretive guide to the trails will also
be developed and will be available to
visitors.

Another project scheduled for early
completionisaecess improvement. The
entrance drive will be graded and new
gravel applied. A parking lot will be
developed and a sanctuary sign in«
stalled.

The plan also calls forgradual resto—
ration ofprairie on the west edge ofthe
property along US. Highway 6. That
area, which formerly was open grass-
land, is now overgrown with haw-
thorns.

The most ambitious part of the
plan is the proposal to remodel the
former dormitory, a lo x 44 it.
wood<frame building, into an inter-
pretiVecénter-slt will provide facili-
ties for programs, displays, educa-
tional activities, research and bird
watching.

Window installed

Already in place is a large new pic-
ture window looking out onto a re»
cently established bird feeding area. A
composting toilet will be installed this

able, the building will be shingled,

interpretive activities and for a work-
shop and storage.

According to Bob VanErsvelde,
president ofthe local Audubon chap-
ter, fund-raising forimplementing the
projects is already underway.

serve this prime piece of nature, and
we are eagerto make it accessible," he
said. “As a volunteer organization, we
know we face considerable challenges,
but we are optimistic that the commu-
nity will support us.“

The land features several species
of trees, including black walnut,
bur oak, box elder, American elm,
silver maple, black willow, hack-
berry. eastern cottonwood, mul—
berry, white and northern red oak,
hickory, black cherry and Ameri-
can basswood.

Plant Varieties

“In the spring these wooded slopes
are covered with wildflowers, begin-
ning with snow trillium in late March
and including, among many others,
blood root, spring beauty, Dutchman's
breeohes, dogtooth violet and wild ge-
ranium," the text ofthe plan states.

“The west part of the property, a
triangular, west-sloping piece between
Highwayﬁandanoldnorth-southroad-
bed . . . was native prairie until 15 or 20
years ago. Remnants of it still are
present. However, most of the area is
now covered thickly with 8-to-12-foot
hawthorn trees."

The plan calls for restoring prairie
and savanna to the hawthorn area.

able from Russell Tabbert at (5l50

This month brought an almost-con-
vergence of Friday, the l3th, and
Valentine's Day.

What a hoot if the two were mixed
up!

Would someone be unlucky in love
orwould the person who walked under
a ladder automatically fall in love?

What about some of other myths of
love and bad luck?

If you 'crossed a black cat and a red
Valentine, what would you get?

lfyou received 13 pieces of Valen-
tine candy, would you consider il a bad
omen and refuse to eat them'.’

Are you “lucky in love"? Happily,
such aconvergence will not affect you!

Actually, there are three Friday, I},
in I998: March and November as well
as February, but close examination of
the calendar reveals that none ofthem
seems to have such close proximity to
other eventful days on the calendar as
February’s.

Somehow, Around missed the boat.
Had we realized the coincidence ear-
lier, perhaps we might have staged an
appropriate celebration, such 'as a
swinging Valentine party complete
with an old-fashioned Valentine box
from which to draw such omens ofbad
luck as black eats, bats. 13 pennies,
and other ill-fated items, but deﬁnitely
no suchtalismans ot‘good luck as four-
leaf clovers.

Maybe we could have deﬁed tra-
dition by having a snake dance under a
maze ofred ladders or released a ﬂock

ofbats into ajungle of red balloons to
see how they would cope. (Best not to
make light of bats, however, because
in their native outdoor habitat they are
a prime devourer of noxious insects.)

Maybe St. Valentine could have
made an appearance wearing a black
costume instead of red and the Prince
of Hearts could have worn a devil's
costume.

Refreshments could include Valenv
tine cookies decorated in black lico-
rice drops.

Such a convergence ofthe calendar
may not happen again for 100 years
and maybe by that time Around will
have some other ideas to mark the
event.
