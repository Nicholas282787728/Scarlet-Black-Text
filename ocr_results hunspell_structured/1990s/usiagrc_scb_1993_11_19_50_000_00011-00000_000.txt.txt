swimmers may develop enough to
help squad depth that was weakened

Women's Basketball Tip-Off Tourny Tonight

By Jason Wolf

THIS weekend the Grinneil
College women ’s basketball
teamwillhosltiieannualTip-
Off Tournament. The Pioneers will
be open against Hamline 2118:30 to
night. in the preliminary Colorado
College will ukeon Marian-Fond du
Lac at4:00. Tomorrow the winners
will meet in the final at 3:00 after the
consolation game at 1:00. Grinncll
won the tournament last season,

Entering her first season at the
helm of the Pioneers, Coach Marti
Kingsley is unsure how her team will
react to the significant changes in-
stalled. Having graduated five see
niors, the Pioneers return only four
lettcrwinncrs from a team that fln~
lshed second in the Midwest Confer-
ence soulhem division with a 10-4
league mark.

“Ideally. we Will be a team that

pushes the ball up the floor and crcr
ates opportunities off the break,"
states Kingsley. “We will be a con-
trolled upvtempo team.”

Although speed and endurance
will be the key, Kingsley acknowl-
edges thaltheteam will besomewhat
inconsistentatfirst. “We don’thave
a set perspective or any set ideas
about this season," she said.

The team's inside game should
be extremely solid. Firstryearpiayer
Jodi VanMeeler and sophomore
Rachel Hendrickson will be counted
on in this position. According to
Kingsley, VanMeeter is a “solid,
stronginsidcpiayerwithgreathantls,”
and Hendrickson, who is playing her
first season of collegiate basketball,
is “quick, fast. and very hard to stop.”
The two will be backed up by sopho»
more Jodi Malin, who was Sidelined
last year with a knee injury.

At the post rookie Tlna Popson
will make the adjustment from the

sixrpiayer game. A strong defender
in high school, Popson “has good
fundamentalsandisagreatrebounder
who has the ability to set some solid
screens for us," according to
Kingsley.

While the inside game and post
position should be solid, this team’s
stretigth will come from the
backcouri. Sophomore Dacey
Waltiron, a second team ailreonfcrr
ence selection last year, will start at
the shooting guard slot. Another
sophomore, Kart i-laliett, will play
thethreerguard posxtion. Sophomore
SaraSclioen willbackupbothguards
and help the team run its breaking
offense.

Kingsleyexpectsthetearn'sonly
senior and its captain, Allison
Wickons,toprovidcmuchoflheleadr
ershlp. “We Will look to her to make
thingshappcnbecauseshchasagreat
power dribble to the basket," says the
coach. “She is definitely a source of

inspiration to this team.“

With Wickens providing much
of the offvcourt leadership, on the
court Waldron and Hallett will be
counted on. “They have to step it up
this year because they’re really the
only ones with the experience,”
Kingsley says.

As the team matures the coach
wtll expect her players to grow, botlt
on and off the court. “We could bea
team thatcan throw a really intense D
at our opponent on the haifcourt and
come back up the floor and work an
offense. 1 hope more than anything
else, we will be best deﬁned by our
level of intensity and desire.“

While the Pioneers will settle for
nothing less than a successful setson,
Kingsley admonishes the Grinneil tam.
ful to be patient with her young team:
“We may be a little rough around the
edges at first unui we get comfonable
with one another. But everyone is really
driven to succeed," she states.
