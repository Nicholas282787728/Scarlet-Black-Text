As a part of Gtinnell’ s Nanjing
Teaching Fellows Program, Chen
lian—Xiu will spend one year at
Grinnell as avisiLing scholar. Chen.
a biology professor at the Univer—
sity of Nanjing in China, is cur-
rently conducting rcsettrch wtlh
Norris Professor of Biology Ken~
neth Christiansen. Christiansen
spent last semester teaching at
Nanjing.

The two are researching the taxi
onomy of collembola insects. Cole
lembola are abundant over almost
all land areas of the world, includ-
ing Antarctica. There are numer-
ousspeciesofthetinyinsects,whtch
play a variety of roles in the envi-
ronment. Chen and Christiansen
hope that their work will promote
further study of the ccllembola in
China. Thus far. there has been
hardly any research in the field.

For Chen, tlle Grinneleranjing
exchange program offers many
opportunities, The fttst and fore-
most of these is the chance to fur-
ther research on the collembola
collected in China. He can also
make use of many of the facilities
here, such as the VAX and Sun
computets and the computerized
library catalogues. He said that his

yearlong stay at Grinnell will give
him plenty of time to absorb as-

pects of American culture.

This is actually the second time
Chen has visited the United States.
Previously he has spent Lime at the
University of Kansas. He enjoys
being in Grinncll and described it
as “a good place to live and learn."

Christiansen has spent many
years researching collembola His
previous projects have inclu.,ed
identifying the collembola of
Hawaii and those found in caves.
Buthisinvolvementintheexchange
allowed him to do more than just
research collembola, He was also
able to funher his interest in the
Chinese culture, which he said has
beenafascinauondatingfromchild-
hood.

He added that there are many

their home towns to work.

Both Chen and Christiansen
argue that the Grinneleranjing
program should be snongly encourv
aged, as they feel that it promotes
the free exchange of ideas and fa
cilities as Well as cultural under-

standing between the two coun-
tries. Christiansen also has strong
views on what he sees as the lack of
American understanding of the
Chinese Culture and thedifficulties
China faces.

"It should be made obligatory
for anybody in any decision~mak~
ing capacity in the United States to
spend at least two months in China
to get an idea of What life is like
there," he said.

Sign Language

Group provides instruction in signing

By Karin Bellomy

Students who want to learn a
new language need not limit them-
selves to the spoken languages of-
fered at Grinnell. The American
Sign Language Club can open up a
new realm of communication and
offer a challenge to anyone who
wishes to learn this unique lan-
guage of hand movements.

“It's a beautiful language, zteSr
thetically,” says senior Heather-
Jeanne Pyle, the club’s instructor.
Although Grinnell’s ASL club has
been around for several years, this
is the first year members are learn
ing sign language systematically,
almost like a class.

Before, members only learned
to sign such things as songs,but this
year they are starting from the very
beginning with the alphabet and
progressingIomoreadvancedsign-
ing, including conversation.

The club has further long-term
goals. Pyle would like the club to
have a silent dinner together every
other Monday to practice the lan-
guage. an activity for people who
are more experienced. But even
more importantly. Pyle hopes that
the members “will get a concept of

deaf culture."
“Deafculture is so different from

hearing culture; (deaf people) have
different mores.” said Pyle.

For instance, when meeting a
new person, a deatpcrson will ask
many personal questions, such as
the names of everyone in your
fatnily, what religion you are, how
many children you have...and the
list goes on. They'll remember all
of this, and expect the person they
are meeting to rememberallthisin-

formation about them, This behave
ior stems from the fact that the deaf
community as a whole is so small
that deaf people want to incorpo—
rate new people into the commu-
nity as quickly as possible.

It should also not be forgotten
that deafpeople live in a very dif-
ferent world from people who can
hear and, like any group, they have
pride in seeing what is unique about
themselves. While most people
seem to have the conception that
deaf people are simply hearing
people who can't hear, Pyle asserLs
this is not so.

“ialways had thisconcept that if
a deaf person had a wish. it would
be to hear, and it isn’t,“ she said.
“They would wish for a million
dollars like everybody else."

Some of the people that Pyle
worked With tllis past summer at
Washington, D.C.’s University for
the Deaf used to Wear hearing aids.
Now they shun them and ask,“How
can you handle that world of noise'.7
It's so loud!" Deaf people even use
the word “hefﬁe” to describea deaf
person who thinks like a hearing
person.

American Sign Language is not
univetsally understood. Pyle met
deaf people from France, Finland,
the Soviet Union and Czechoslova»
kia this summer and each person
used a different fortn of sign lane
guage. However, American Sign
Languageisused by 500,000peop1e
in the United States and Canada,
and is the fourth most common lan-
guage in the US.

People inlerersted in teaming
sign language should Contact Pyle.
The club meets every Tuesday at
6.15 pm. in the Wake.
