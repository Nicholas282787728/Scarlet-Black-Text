A call to the campus community

GUEST COMMENTARY
SARAH HALLAS

Though this speech was written
for, and delivered at, Women Take
Back the Night, its message is appli»
cable to everyone on campus.

bic world, I have to constantly attic»

this part of my identity and partici—

time being willing to put myselfon
the front line to fight oppression and
injustice in allofits forms. But being
lesbian is only one part of my iden-
tity, and it can‘t be the only part I
acknowledge and deal with. I’m also
awoman,l’malso middle-class,AND
I‘m also white Just as I experience
oppression because of my sexual ori.
entation and my gender, I also expe»
rience priVilege because of my class
and race. I’m on both sides of the
dynamic of oppression. I’m dealing
with the status of oppressed and op—
pressor at the same time. It’s a chal—
lenge to come to terms with these
conﬂicting parts of my identity, but
it’s something that I need to do.

As I already mentioned, the first
partofmy identity is that I‘m lesbian
and that's something the majority of
the US population isn’t too comfort—
able With. But we all know that,
because at some time in all of our
lives we’ve been around people who
make blatant, homophobic tematks,
sometimes we remain silent though
screaming on the inside, and some-
times we challenge rhose comments.
Perhaps we‘ve participated in such
talkourselves,atonetimeoranother
and for whatever reasons. But we‘ve
also encountered more subtle forms
of an antirGay—Lesbian—Bisexual«

hid; it is about recognizing what it
means to be heterosexual and the
priVileges that are automatically at—
tached to that identity. For all peo—
ple,bothstraightandGLBT,itmeans
recognizing the homophobia in our—
selves that has been ingrained in us
since birth, and taking steps toward
dealing with that homophobia.

Tho sccond part otrny identiiyl
have to deal with is being a woman,
When I was house. and dogsitting
tor one of my professors out in the
country, I experienced that (eat of
being alone as night camp, and 1
locked all the doors and turned on
the TV for company. When I walk
through campus at night, I have to
watch my baclt because lltn con.
cetncd about what might happen to

classroom, I have to think about how
my feminist perspective might some
times be the only one. When I react
emotionally to something which I
should have “more control over," I
have to deal with the fact that I get
called too sensitive. I have to think
about friends of mine who are deal—
ing With eating disorders and suffer
when they do, I have to think about
all the \vomenl know who have been
abused and harassed; how they try to
heal and how we all try to stltvive in
a world so prone to Violence against
women And when I think about
entering the workplace, I have to
consider occupational segregation,

too

But I can't get so caught up in
"my issues" that I forget to think
about the issues that also relate to
me, even if they aren‘t necessarily
evident. The rhird piece otmy iden»

tity is my class status. As a middle
class person, I grow tip in a world

(antion the Contraryibllt I always
believe there has to be a practical
application of what I and all of my
sisters learn. And that ptaxis begins
for all or us by recogr ig our class
status and our classism,

The fourth part of my identity I
want to talk about is my race, I think
race is the most difficult piece to talk
about because it‘s infused with so
much meaningandexperience. Asa
white person, I haven't had to think
about race because I’m the norm, so
for a long time I lived in my little
color—blind world, treating people of
color in a way that l perceived to be
equal, touting the cap at a liberal.

but all the while not really rccognic
mg my while priyilcge. Frankly, l
think many whites on campus fall
exactly into this category and I think
that‘s the most dangerous position to
be in. I’d like to share With you once
again a few excerpts from Peggy Ma-

This step of recognizing pnyi.

Struggling with all of these \$<
sues inside myself brings me to the
question, how can we as women
bridge the gaps between tis that :IIien»
ate and isolate tis from each other
and keep us from fully taking back
the nightl To me, Take Back the
Night is about many things It is
aboutEmpoweringoutsehesfiswom—
en, feeling a sense of community,
reﬂecting on where we've been,
where we are, and \\ here we’re going
in terms of individiials’ experiences
and women's movements across the
nation and around the world. But
perhaps most importantly, Women
Take Back the Night is about refus—
ing to legitimize and maintain those
racial, class, and sexual orientation

barriers that keep women from truly
uniting. Tliat'sthesttiigglc that most
of us haven’t dealt with, and that's
the struggle that all ofus desperately
