from winrer break we have ro log
on re NT Srorage, and prerry soon
Macs are crashing all over campus.
We have a new plague ro complain
abour. In rhe meanrime, Russell K
sweeps in, assesses rhe siruarion, and
derermincs rhar rhe besr way ro im.

and we are abour ro enrer rhe ere

open Curriculum.

This synopsis omirred one ime
porranr evcnr when we finally
showed signs of life. Terrible hare
crimes were commirred againsr
people in our communiry, includ.
ing one ofour RLCs. For rhe firsr
rime in my shorr sray ar Grinnell,
we came back from rhe dead. We
came our by rhe hundreds ro con.
demn hare crimes and ro supporr
rhose in our communiry who suf-
fered rhem. Equally imporranr, in
lighr of rhe presenr siruarion, we
said loud and clear rhar we consider
rhe RLCs ro be inregral, valued
members ofour community.

Srill, rwo imporranr rrends have
dominared our recenr hisrory. Firsr,
rhe srudenr body has allowed seri.
ous changes ro occurwirhourmuch

we do rake large scale acrion ro
bring issues ro rhe rrusrees and die
adminisrrarion, rhey sronewall us.
We were nor allowed proper repre»

commirree. We buy producrs made
from old growrh rrees, and we buy
clorhes made in swearshops. In an
anomaly in rhese passive rimes, stur
denrs have invcsred years of dedi-

In rhe 19805, we gor rhesronewall

Now Crady and Co. would like
ro climinare rhe Direcror of sru.

Aids Tent at waltz scrapped,

Q

Dear Presidenr Osgood,

As Chair ofrhe Walre commirrce, my commirree and I have a respone
sibiliry ro rhe srudenrs ro provide a highequallry evenr for rhe College.

This has been and srill remains our primary goal. By rhe College, I
mean rhe srudenrs, rhe faculry, and rhe sraff. Ir is wirh rhis informarion in
mind rhar I am wriring you ro inquire ofrhe recenr decision made regard—
ing rhis Spring'sWalrz. Ir is my hope rhar by meering wirh you, I shall come
ro undersrand rhis decision and be able ro fully arriculare ro rhe srudenr
body rhe rarionale upon which rrwas based. Therefore, I ask you re give me
rwenry ro rhirry minures of your rime berween now and spring Break, I
have cleared my schedule ofany commirmenrs berween now and rhen, and
Lisa Marye is willing ro join us ar rhis mecring. Ifyou would be so kind as
re rake a few minures ro read my concerns, rhen meer wirh me ar a rime of
your choice ro discuss rhese concerns. I would whole-hearrcdly appreciare
ir. I undersrand you are a busy man, cerrainly busier rhan I, bur I feel rhar
rhis issue is one rhar needs ro be addressed now as a specific rime frame for
implemenrarion of decisions hinders our abiliry ro delay rhis discussion
furrlrer.

Ir was only Tuesday ofrhis week rhar I was made aware ofrhe decision
rhar has been made in regards ro Wake. In case ir is unclear whar I am
ralking abour, I will elaborare. I was informed rhar because Faciliries Man.
agemenr did norwanr ro enrerrain rhe renr oprion, anorher was enrerrained
and decided upon. This ofcourse is rhe decision ro renr a dance floor and
pur ir down over rhe Darby Gymnasium floor so as nor ro ruin ir. While I
somewhar undersrand rhe concerns of FM wirh regards ro rhe grounds,
logisrics, manpower, and cosr, I do nor fully undersrand rhe logic behind
rhe enrirc dccision.’£his is rhe hrsr ofrhe rhree maior concerns mycommir.
ree and I have wirh rhis issue. The second is rhar rhe srudenr voice and
represenrarion in rerms ofWaltz was nor consulred in rhe process ofmak.
ing rhis decision. Third, and possibly mosr rroubling, rhis decision repre-
senrs a direer change of rhe plans which Lisa Marye and I felr you had
commirred yourselfro in our mecring early rhrs semcsrer. Wirh rhese rhree
concerns in mind, Iwill rry ro develop a more derailed picrure ofrhe siru-
arion.

Inirially, in our meering early rhis semesrer, you agreed rhar u was nec.
essary ro provide rhe opporruniry forWalre ro be more oran all. -cncompa:5v
ing all campus cvcnr. In order ro do rhis, given rhe narure of rhe dance
form (swing requires a good bir ofroom ro move) and rhe high arrendance
ofrhe evenr, errra space in addirion ro rhar ofrhe Harris Concerr Hall was
needed. We agreed upon rhe oprion ofa renr ro supplemenr rhe Harris
cenrer in order ro meer rhese goals and needs. Ar rhis poinr, we also agreed
rnar Darby was nor a legirimare oprion due ro rhe risk ofhurring rhe facility’s
floor, Lisa and I lefr rhis meering and proceeded ro go abour a lisr of prepa»
rarions for rhe new addirion ro rhe evenr, The hrsr ofrhese was re conracr
FM and mecr wirh rhem abour our ideas so rhar we could be as accommo-
daring ro rhem as possible. Thcy never gor back ro us wirh a rime ro meer
wirh rhem. Furrher, neirher Lisa Marye nor I received any concerns from
FM abour rhe logisrics. manpower, grounds, or cosr ofrhis endeavor, ocher
inrer-scA prepararions were made which included rhc announeemenr rhar
you had given us rhe unique opporruniry ro make rhis cvenr one rhar would
dwarfmosr orher sludcnrerun evenrs, Mosr srudenrs were pleased, excited,
and even grarifred by rhis gracious allormenr on your parr.

Now rhar I have discussed rhe recenr hisrory, some quesrions arise,

Why was rhe decision made in a circle rhar did nor allow for rhe srudenr
concerns ro be considered.) (By rhrs qucsrion I am nor claiming rhar rhe
decision makers do nor have rhe besr inrcrcsr of'rhe srudenrs in mind, bur
rarher rhar an evenr which is run by srudenrs should be accounrable ro
srudenr decisions surrounding rhar evenr. By removing rhe chance for a
sruderrr voice ro oppose rhis before ir was decided, we removed rhe power
over rhe evenr from rhe student's hands) Why has rherc been no clear,
rarional, and well- arriculared erplanarion for rhis decision? A mere mcn—
rion ar Joinr Board and a briefemail ro me by Sarah Asch is nor iusrificarion
for a decision of rhis magnirude, especially when so many hours of my

plan differenr from rhar which you had given your commirmenr ro ar rhe
beginning ofrhis semesrer2 This is rhe quesrion rhar I am mosr inreresred
in having you answer for me, bur I would rarher you do rhar in person rlran
rhrough email. .

Finally, I would just like ro express rhe remaining concerns. By holding
Walrr in Darby, irwill become impossible ro invire rhe faculryand sraffon
a widespread basis in rhe mariner rhar you, Lisa, and I had hoped ro do.
Thus, by serrling for Darby and rhc oprion which has been selecred, we
have eliminarcd rhe possibiliryofa rruly all—campus evenr. Also, rhe whole
issue of nor gerring somerhing rhey felr had been given ro rhem has dis.
couraged rhe srudenrs. I have had so warch rhe disappoinred looks on many
srudenrs faces as rhey have found our, and ir would be helpful ifI could
arriculare ro rhem why we have re go forrh wirh rhis oprion. 0r, ifwe do
nor have ro go forrh wirh rhe Darby oprion, irwould be useful ro rell rhem
rhar as well. The srudenr populace has been dishearrened as ir is larely, and
rhe crciremenr rhar had been generared by rhc ralk ofa renr ar Walrz was a
brighr spor for mosr srudenrs wirh whom I have ralked. The srudenrs now
realize rhe errreme difference berween rhe previously agreed upon and cur»
renr plans, yer rhere is no undersranding as re why. Finally, from a srricrly
logisric poinr ofview on my parr, decoraring Darby will be a nighrmare,
especially since we can nor roll a Genie lifr device onro rhe gym floor, and
rhere is some quesrions as ro wherher ladders will hurr rhe floor as well.This
severely hurrs our abiliry ro pur on a highoualiry evenr.

I know rhis is long. I rhank you for your rime and your conrinued
commirmenr. I know rhar you are commirred ro rhe srudenrs and ifrhere
were any one person whom I could go ro wirh my concerns rhar would ralk
wirh me in a fair and unbiased manner, ir would be you, For rhese reasons
I implore you ro meer wirh me ar any rime over rhe nerr rwo days (Thurs-
day and Friday) ro discuss rhis issue.

Thank you for yo ime and considerarion,

Be a Thinker

BY ARIN HILL

Grinncll College. Whar does rhar mean? Well, honesrly ir means this:
Grinncll College is a place rhar encourages close arudenr-faculry relation»
ships, upholds a general scnse ofunified communiry, acceprs and encour.
ages diversiry wirhin rhe srudcnr body, giv ~irs srudenrs an educarion whose
lifelong benehrs excccd irs high and somerimes seemingly excessive ruirion,
demands rhar srudenr speak up and rake responsibiliry for rhe charaerer of
rheiracademicand social experience and ulrimarely, overall upholds rhe rrue
ideologies ofa presrigious liberal arrs insrirurion.

Basically, rhe acrual crinnell experience is yusr as ir is “advertised" in
rhese glossy view books. However, larely I have discovered rhar rhere is one
flaw rhar is consranrly rerouched, reﬁned, and rhus, hidden in all Grinncll
marerials. The simple facr is rhar rhere are a large number ofsrudenrs here
who are quasirlibcralisfs and socially, polirically. and culrurally uninformed.
Some srudenrs here have a rcndency ro say one rhingand do or mean some.
rhing else.

For example, only a few days afrer rhe beginning ofrhe new school year
and my firsr year here, a guy said rhar he was glad he was around differenr
varieries ofpeople now rhan in high school. Why is ir rhar a few days larerhc
said he was glad char he did nor have any black guys on his floor because he
would nor have ro lisren ro rap music? Anorher example: one girl asked me
ifall black people clapped when rhey laughed. (I don't know, you rell me?!)
I could go on, bur I won’r. I rhink we ger rhe picrure,

As a “srudcnr ofcolor” here, I have been subjecr ro hear and read some of
rhe mosr ignoranr sraremenrs. People need ro undersrand rhar, alrhough I
am a “srudenr ofcolor," and you may or may nor be, eirher way, rr does nor
give you rhe auromaric righr ro use me as your personal educarional rool on
black hisrory or your springboard for ideas rlrar usually srem from a racisr or
prejudiced frame ofmind.

However, ifanyone wanrs ro engage in an inrellecrual and comprehen»
sive conversarion wirh me (or anyone else for rhar marrer who agrees wirhin
rheir own personal conrerr), rhen fine. For rhose of us who have forgorrenr
a conversarion is when rwo people communicare, which includes ralking ro

'and lisrening ro someone, which I hope, somerimes includes rhe goal of
reaching a new sense of undersranding. A conversarion is nor ralking ar
someone or simply hearing words spoken.

I encourage all srudenrs ro use rheir college experience ro have as many
conversarions as possible. And nor iusr all meaningless, silly and playful
conversarions wirh rhe same people. Mix up rhe variables. Talk ro difrerenr
people abour borh serious and fun subiecrs and engage your core group of ,
peers in serious conversarions. I encourage all srudenrs regardless ofmaiorrs)
or personal background ro ask rhoughrful quesrions (in a respecrful manner
and ifyou carinor do rhar, rhen read a book). Ask quesrionswirh rhe goal of
learning new informarion, undersranding someone else's perspecrive or
achieving a new perspeerive orsense ofselfalrogerher. Inrcracrion wirh orh.
ers is whar really counrs in rhe real world. There is no poinr'in having a
college degree ifyou are ignoranr abour rhe real world. Afrcr all, a large pare
of rhe college experience is ro encourage srudenrs ro move beyond rheir
immediare worlds ofknowledge and re expand rheir vision ro become more
comprehensive. To become more comprehensive, ir is essenrial ro lisren ro
ideas and opinions rhar we mighr nor wanr ro and rhen process rhem, bur
nor ro immediarely reject rhem. Thar is when we srop learning.

Ler's grow up, people. Move beyond rhe esrablished norions of“I” and
"me" and arrempr ro undersrand rhe unsrable norions of "we" and “us. “
Afrer all, whar you give is whar you ger back in rerurn. Ifyou do nor wanr
crap coming back ro fly in your face when you leasr erpecr ir, rhen don't dish
it out.

Don’t we have enough ro deal wirh just based on rhe simple laws of
narure, why add ro it? (It is simple logic.) Do nor iusr graduare wirh a de.
gree. Graduarcwirh some basic undersranding in regard ro humaniry. Ifnor
for yourself, for rhe resr ofus. Frankly, I am rired ofhearing rhe commenrs.
beliefs, ideas and opinions in regard ro social, polirical or culrural issues rhar
only reflecr a sel 'nreresred and self-involved undersrandrng, ifyou can call

all
