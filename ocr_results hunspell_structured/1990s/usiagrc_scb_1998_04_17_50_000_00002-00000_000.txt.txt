were excited when we saw the num-
ber of students and faculty that par-
ticipated and presented papers, but
we were also excited about the num-
ber of students, staff faculty and
members of the community that
turned up."

“Initially, more than a few people
were pessimistic," Gibel Azoulay
said. “People said it was a bad idea,
that people at Grinnell were so busy
and that there were so many activi—
ties and many other complications.
Siclinda and [just said ‘let's just set
a date and just go with it‘. “

Following in the tradition estab-
lished last year, this year's confer-
ence was set between the intennedi-
ary days of Passover. the Jewish fes-

tival celebrating liberty andp com
memorating the Israelite exodus
from Egypt. "The holiday represents
freedom and liberation from slavery
and was the paradigm for what we
wanted to represent," she said.

According to Professor Scott,
“Diversity does not just mean have
ing representation for people of color
any longer. It means to prepare you
to live in a diverse society and a div
verse world, so it is absolutely a cri-
teria for any student graduating from
a college in the twenty ﬁrst century."

The conference, which took place
in the Noyce Science Center, fea-
tured 19 speakers broken up into four
sessions. “It’s a wonderful thing.

Also. similar research has previ—

While they were less interested in
motorists stopping for a meal than
in visitors staying in town, owners
of the County Inn still deemed
Grinnell an appropriate place to build
a new hotel._ Construction of the
hotel on a lotjust north of Days Inn
and near the interstate is set for this
summer. It is not a resturant, but it

from new restaurants does not mean
Grinnell is without eateries. Ten
years ago, according to Walker, one
of Grinnell’s “biggest issues" was the
lack of restaurants. Since then, the
town has gained a multitude of eat-
ing esmblishments, including Cafe
Phoenix, JD'S, and others. Consid-
ering the amount of growth in those
ten years, Walker said, “This is
progress." But considering the stu—
dents who wish to see a greater vari-
ety in restaurants, Walker continued,

ing frequent communication with the
campus community.

The entire student body is strongly
encouraged to contribute their own
questions at next week’s sessions.

As Langemd and Kristof noted,
great emphasis is put on student in

currently been set for Monday and

m C USA: American Studies Seminar

On Wednesday, April 22 at 4:15 the American Studies
Seminar will be presenting a production in the Harris
Cinema. It is a Combination of their studies of fast
food culture in the United States, more explicitly “a
presentation of the what McDonalds is doing to the
world," director Joe Moon explained. Production direc-
tor Ben Patrick explained that the “purpose of the
presentation is to present some aspects of fast food
culture, like routinization and corporate globalization
in a fashion that is entertaining, accessable and fun.
We’re having a fun time putting it together — defi-
nitely our primary goal is to enjoy it —— it’s important
for us to be able to communicate the academic ideas.
That’s what we're aiming for.”

The presentation is a collection of sketches each
member of the seminar has written. Professor Kesho
Scott has been very enthusiastic in "her support of the
idea of a theatrical presentation, and aims for a 3-
dimensional portrait of the effect McDonalds has had
on the Us. as a symbol of big business and popular
culture. Each student, Patrick explained, will have a
role in the sketches as well as back stage. Afterwards
Scott and the cl'ass will have a question and answer
session. Patrick hopes the presentation will “educate
the audience if the concepts are unfamiliar, and be
entertaining if they are.”
