What do you believe makes
you the best qualiﬁed candidate
tor SGA president?

I’mtijunior,andafterthrecyearsof
seeing how SGA works, I think I
have a lot of good ideas about
changes that could be made to im-
prove it.

What do you foresee as the
most important issues facing
SGA, and what changes would
you ini rote tor SGA?

Ilhink whatl would like to see is
more student input, more campus
wide initiatives about policicsﬂnc
speciﬁc policy that really bothers
me is the pluking policy—the fact

that students with more money can
put down more money to get the
better spots. I think the use of the
Harris Center—showing movies
during the week, and things like
thatilhcrc’s a lot of room for im-
provement there, too Things like
bringing bands to campusil don ‘t
see why there can't be campus ml'

bands come to campus, rather than

that I would like to see change, but
justbeeaiisellhink ihorearoihings

doesn‘t necessarily meun that the
campus Wlll make them better. I
think I should have ideas and bring
them to the campus, but Llny ideas I
should bring up should be decided
by the campus. 50 I think there
should be a more democratic soci-
ety on campus, a universal democr
racy in which the students make all
the decisions, lather thanjust come
mittees.

What have you contributed to
the campus, and now do you feel
you have represented student in-

initiatives
terests in that contribution?

I think that as a Hall ACUVIIICS

best within my dorm (I‘ve been
there two years) to try to make the
freshmen feel comfortable at

the opportunities and things that
are at Grtnncll.

What does SGA luck that you
can provide?

[think the most importantlhing
is more input from the students. I

Fernandez-McCarthy stresses SGA

knowledge, time commitment

What do you believe makes
you the best qualiﬁed candidate
tor SGA president?

Number one, I reel I'm cxccpr
tionally devoted to my job, and I
llavca very strong work ethic. I was
heavily involved with SGA my
freshman and sophomore years, as
wcllasthis year. Ispcntalotoftimc
over the summer doing some very
interesting reading on parliamentary
procedure. I've also taken my job
very seriously this year, so far. I
have a very deep knowledge as to
whatSGA’ 5 involved with and what
it has the power to affect.

What do you foresee as the
most important issues facing
SGA, and What changes would
you initiate for SGA?

One issue is an issue that comes
up every year, and that’s the rela-
tionship between the college com-
munity and the town. I've already
tried to deal with it this year. I,
along with Heather Kenvin-Hietala
and several otherGrinnell College

students, helped organize a new
townAgown committee called the
College/School Youth Relations
Organization. The focus is, primar
rily,developingascnscofeommu-
nity between the youth of Grinnell
and the college community. Hope-
fully it will be a really effective
organization that can discuss a lot
ofissues.

What have you contributed to
the campus, and how do you feel
you have represented student in-
terests in that contribution?

Number one. again going back
to the work ethic idea, I feel I've
done a goodjob dealing with a lot
of the minor burmucratlc issues
thatSGA has to deal with on a day-
today basis. I’m very good about
responding to my computer mail; I
respond to it religiously. I spend a
lot of time in my ofﬁce. I had 14
officehours last semester, l2 hours
this semester. I'm only required to
have four, but I've found that in
order to do everything I have to do
and still have time to meet the stu-

not necessarily for me, I have to
spend that much time in the office.
I also think that I'm pretty good at
listening to students; I was a Stu-
dentAdviserlastycar,alldl'm also
a memberoftheOfficeofCommuV
nityRights MediationTeam. I think
Ihave pretty good skillsalongthosc
lines. Overall, I think I've done a
pretty good job this year.

What has been your greatest
contribution to SGA?

I’ve tried very hard to learn as
much as I can aboutthis job; I have
a very deep knowledge about what
SGA is involved with, and what it
can do. Itstudenls come to me with
eoncems,1 know exactly what they
need to do; I give them suggest

administrators, that’s fine. oriflhey
want to meet with administrators
themselves, then I tell them how to
do it

Stippich emphasizes
SGA responsibilities

What do you feel makes you
the best qualiﬁed candidate tor
SGA president?

Through the past year ill my
role as Assistant Treasurer, I feel
like I’ve gained a good knowledge
of how student govemmcni works
and how it interacts with students
and the administration. I'vc been
involved with several studentorga-
nizalions, and I feel that I have a
quality of mediating student inter
ests Ihatcan help in the role ofSGA
president. I don't feel that I’m
Iacklng in any experience. In addi-
tion, I think that what I've done in
the role of Assistant Treasurer has
shown that I do work to gather nil
sides of information on student
activiticsbcforc wcnlakedectsions
in here. This will be good to carry
through in the role of president.

What do you toresee as the
most important issues facing
SGA, and what changes would
you initiate tor SGA?

In the upcoming year, the most
important issues I see for SGA
would be the ways SGA interacts
between students and the adminis-
tration. It seems that for years,
student government has been a
group of a Icw students who are
removed from most of the campus.
and SGA is something that people
don'trmlly know whalitis. I think
that that‘s something that needs to
change, and with thclneoming ofa
new president, we will have the
opportunityto change ourrelations
with the administration as well, in
that SGA needs to become more of
a facility for student ideas. It needs
to work for the students,rather titan
dictate what the students should do
or believe.

What have you contributed to
the campus, and how do you feel
that you have represented student
interests in that contribution?

Especially in this past year, I
feel that I have, to the best of my
ability, in my role as Assistant
Treasurer, worked to improve this

loo/cause the mild role of S ,\ has

to the students. I think that overthc
past year, that's where the main
involvement has bccnithrough
sports clubs. SAs and HACS: how
we allocate money there and how
they interact with our office.

What would you say has been
your greatest contribution to
SGA?

Thenew organization which has

everything goes. chantrack down
where every little penny gocs. The
combination of the accounting
system on the computer and the
record-keeplng which we have my
corporate/.1 in this office allows us
to change the yearly audit that was
usually lhrecdays into a halfrartluy
process. We've improved the effi-
cicncy of the olftcc, tInLl in doing
so, we gathered more student ll-lptlt
on how we can bctterhclp students
and student groups.

Why would you be a success-
ful correspondent with the
college's administration and
faculty?

Ifccl that I have gained a good
working relationship with many of
the members oflheadministration.
Through my involvement with
student govemmenl, I am able to
accurately represent all student
viewpoints] try to remove my bias
from the way I present an idea to
any of the administratorsithdt’s
what I feel would help the admin»
istrative side.

Why have you chosen to run
for president rather than taking
over your guaranteed position as
SGA Treasurer?

I have enjoyed the role I played
this year as one of the SGA trea-
surers, but I feel lJlat there have
been so many improvements in this
office that there won't be as far to
go with my energies next year. I
enjoy the work that I’ve done in
bringing together students and thel r
ideas. I feel that the best way to do
that would be through the office of
president, because the president
doesn‘t have many delegated res
sponsibilities.It’smainlyaposltion
that you can make of it whatever
you want, I lllink there’s a lot that
can be done in improving relations
with SGA anti students, with SGA
and the utllninistrthion, and SGA
with the town. and I don't forcscc
