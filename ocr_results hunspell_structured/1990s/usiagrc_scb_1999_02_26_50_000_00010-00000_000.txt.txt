10 STATEMENTS OF INTENT Scarlet 8’ Black - Friday, Februaﬂ 26

 

Hi! My name is Andy Civettini and I want to be your SGA Vice PreSident/ President ofAcademic
Affairs next year! There are some things yoti should know about me. First, I don’t care what our U.S, World
News and Report ranking is. Second, I don‘t sit around and wait for things to change, I make them change.
Third, I am enthusiastic about being your VP/PAA next year and am committed to achieving the goals ofthe
entire student body. Now that you know what you need to know aboilt me to elect me, I think it’s only fair I
should tell you what I have done that qualifies me and what it is I'll do for YOU in office.
My first year: ~ This year:
Cleveland 3" Floor Rep, Waltz Committee Chair
Student Services Committee invaluable experience in SGA
Waltz Committee Very elaborate Spring Waltz
Helped the Elections Committee Bieweekly editorial in 5&8 (read this Friday)
Both years: Various campus clubs such as EAG and Grinnell Students for Natural Law

My first goal in leading Grinliell's Student Curriculum Committee (SCC) and giving direction to the
Student Educational Policy Committees (SEPC’s) will be to increase the direct student committee involvement
in curriculum change and faculty selection. The ﬁrst step-in accomplishing this will be to strengthen the SEPC’s
by sitting down with each one of them and helping them ilnprove how they work. Once this is done, the SCC
will work with the administration to make sure the departments listen to the individual SEPC’s recommenda-
tions. Furthermore, the general student body does not have enough say in the cumculum changes, so i propose a
two—fold attack on this impediment. First, “faculty lunches" will be held, where faculty comes to the dining halls
and discuss ideas on curriculum with the students. Second, the individual SEPC's will be encouraged to hold
open forums discussing their work. This Will pronde opportunities for all students to get more involved in
curriculum change.

In addition to increased student involvement and inﬂuence in curriculum, I propose other changes that
will beneﬁt all of us. One such change will be to work with President Osgood and the various other administra—
tors to reallocate the money to hire more permanent faculty and visiting professors. These “guest profs" would
be interviewed and hired by the SCC, not any one department, so that we guarantee direct student choice. This
will enable us to bring some professors to campus that do not easily fit any one department on campus. This
would guarantee the students an opportunity to bring diverse professors (in both the multicultural and curricular
senses) to campus and to give them the opportunity to apply for tenure tracks. Next, it is imperative that we
work with the administration to make sure the Capstone is not mandatory so we don‘t burden the existing
faculty. Finally, convocation is a major part of our liberal education, but let’s face it, it isnlt that great. I want to
make convo more integral to our education by changing its structure. Bring in higher proﬁle speakers, bring in
multicultural speakers, and bring in fewer speakers if that‘s what it takes to get the better ones.

The other major part ofthe VP/PAA position, the coo committee, will be my other top priority. I
believe every one of us has the right to demand a bigger, stronger, and more ﬁnancially supported CDC in the
next year. I will Work with the administration all year to reallocate the funds from somewhere in the budget to
give the CDO more money. It’s no great secret that Grinnell has a lot of money, and we need to figure out how
to use it more Wisely. The CD0 is a wise use of our money. The CDO is the best resource available to students
on this campus. The added funds could pay for more internships, research, and most importantly, staff for the
CD0, I will personally call alumni to make sure we expand the extemship program started by the CDO commit-
tee this year. Ihave talked to Jess Dvorak, current VP/PAA, and I feel that I can continue the crusade to make
the CDO work for you!

I am concerned about many other issues, and would be willing to talk about any ofthern with you, but I
chose here to concentmte on the most important things relevant to the VP job. The issues that are more relevant
to the President’s job I will leave to those candidates, and not ﬂood you with talk ofspace, SPARC, Dining
Services, etc. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your vote and your support in my role as VP/PAA
in the coming year.

 

 

Rebecca Major for Vice—President President of Academic Affairs

ME Am D
My name is Rebecca Major. I am a junior and an Economics major.

I have been involved extensively in“SGA during my time at Grinnell. My
freshman year I was the Floor Representative for Dibble 3”. Sophomore
year I was the SGA Senator for Cléveland Hall and first semester this
year I was the OCNCO Senator. I have been involved in different
committees, such as ACE, Concerts, and Publicity committee. This
experience has given me an intimate knowledge of the workings of
student government, its successes and its failures.

ugy am I rgnning:

I am running for viceePresident because I believe chat this is a
critical period in Grinnell's history. With the drive to push the
college into national prominence, change in one form or another is
virtually inevitable. I believe the challenge for the coming year is
keeping the student’s interests primary to the administrative decisione
making process. The role of Vice»Presidenc/Fre5ident of Academic
Affairs'will be key in representing these interests and channeling the
development of the college.

My Platformf
It is common knowledge that Grinnell has a large endowment which

allows for many amazing campus programs to be funded. There are
presently an abundance of proposals.as to how the campus should spend
the endowment money. I believe there are several areas which have been
neglected in administrative support.

First of all, the college needs a strong and well supported
Career Development Office, one which is able to meet the needs of
Grinnell studencs in their poscegraduace planning. The college needs
to guarantee that all of its students have the Option of at least one
summers worth of paid internship/research experience. Although an
additional $50,000 has already been allocated to the CDO for the
purpose of providing internship experience, this amount will only
provide paid internships for approximately 15 students. It is
imperative that the college provide the same opportunicy for all of its

studentsi
Secondly, the college needs to more directly address, through its

financial support, the need for faculty diversity. I believe that this
issue, along with the growing problem of increased class size, can be
jointly addressed through the creation of new tenure»track positions
and the hiring of additional faculty. In hiring these new faculty
members, the college should place an emphasis on seeking out qualified
minority candidates. ,

Another pressing issue is the “Capstone Experience" proposal.
outlined in the Fund for Excellence, the capstone program would
eventually require all students to Complete a “research/creative
project” under faculty guidance. In its present form, this additional
requirement would prove to be a burden to both students and faculty.
First of all, this proposal is a direct affront to Grinnell’s open
the Cornerstone of our liberal arts experience. Secondly.
there will be direct

unacceptable option.

Finally, the college needs to show support for its beleaguered
publications. SPARC (Student Publications and Radio Committee), the
oversight committee for all student media, currently suffers from a
lack of necessary funds. As publication costs have Increased with
inflation, the SFARC budget has remained stagnant. In order for
Grinnell co enjoy topequaliey'publicaeion, SPARC funding must be
increased.

Through the combination of my experience and commitment to
student government, I feel that I am the candidate who with represent
the students interests through this time of change.

Please vote on March 3’%

Bryan Dunham
For
VP

hli. My name is Bryan Dunham, and I .im running for the position of SGA Vice»President/President ofAca-
demic Affairs. Many of you know me already, but for those of you who don't, let me tell you a little bit about
myself. I nm a junior Psychology major from Des Moines. I live at l217 Park St. (aka Jonestown).

In my time here, i have seen some changes, from the change in College presidents to the establishment
ofthe security office. The number ofcases brought before hearing boards (either Drug and Alcohol or Judco)
was inﬁnitesimal during my first year here, with a preference for allowing the student to work with the RLCs
and student staff on such problems, emphasizing the individuals role in making necessary changes. Now, the
number ofcases brought before the hearing boards is significantly higher, which emphasizes the college’s role in
shaping the behavior of its students. I would like to see the college adopt its previous attitude, especially by not

» sending as many cases to the Drug and Alcohol hearing board.

I feel the increased involvement on the part ofthe college may represent an effort by the administration
to exert a greater degree ofcontrol over the general life ofthe students here. One ofthe major differences
between other colleges and us is the degree of freedom allotted us. The college used to place a lot oftrust in us
as students, and our abilities to make good choices. Now, it seems this attitude has eroded somewhat. I would
like to become a force to prevent any further erosion. _

What have I done before to Show I am qualiﬁed? I have held numerous jobs on campus, including
working at Cowles. Quad, being a UC, working for the Registrar, and being editor ofthe GUM. In addition, I
have held a position with SPARC this past year.

Here is where I stand on the issues, with a reminder that I am always willing to listen to other voices
who feel strongly about them:

Capstone: I like the capstone, but I don‘t want a mandatory capstone. Students should be allowed to
decide for themselves ifit is necessary for their Grinnell experience

Tutorial size: This is related to the capstone in that one possible consequence of the capstone is the
increase in tutorial size. I feel that this absolutely cannot be allowed to happen under any circumstance.

Number of 200 level classes: Me and most of the people I know have been closed out of enough 200
level classes without the decrease hinted at by President Osgood. .

Pretty much all ofthe curriculum changes seem to be highly unpopular with the students. Being the
President of Academic Affairs entitles the VP a special position to advocate the views of the student on curricu-
lum, and the VP has a responsibility to represent these views fairly. This is something I promise to do as VP/
PAA. And I promise to always, always make myself available to criticism or opinion from the students I wish to
represent. Just let me know at x4362 or at [DUNHAM]. And, as I've said to people before, I am a psych major,
so I’ll always have extra time on my hands, extra time for you and your concerns. Thank you.

 

Hello, my name is Jim Dinnerville. I am running for SGA Vice President.

Selfegovernance is conscience.

Thank you for your time,

Jim Dinnerville,

 

John Aerni‘s Statement of Intent

Hill My name is John Aerni and I am running for SGA Vice-PresidenI/President of
Academic Affairs. As most of you probably do not know me, let me introduce myself. I am a
sophomore history major from Cincinnati, Ohio. I am also enrolled in the education program
and plan to teach high school history after I graduate. At Grinnell, 1 am, or have been in-
volved with a number of different activities that will aid me in serving you as VP/PAA. I teach
local 3" graders German in the Alter School Foreign Language Program, have hosted a KDIC
show, run on the track and cross country teams, serve as Cowles Hollis senator to Joint Board,
and currently serve on the Election Committee and Student Services Committee.

Through these activities, I have come into contact with a large cross-section of cani-
pus. This is important because I see the job of VP/PAA as a link between the student body, the
administration, the trustees, and the Student Government Association itself. My primary goal
as VP/‘PAA would be to foster cooperation between these various groups, to bring them
together in working toward the same goaléto make Grinnell College a better place to live and
learn. If you elect me, my priority will be to communicate with you to determine your true
feelings on issues that should be addressed by the campus community. To ensure this happens,
I will hold open forums in all dorm lounges on a regular basis so that you have an opportunity
to express your ideas and opinions and feel that you are getting personal results from SELF-
governance.

A part of the VP job that is just as important as understanding campus opinion, is
communicating the administrationis and trusteesi stances on issues to the campus community
as a whole. I think this is the weakest link in SGA. News about the administration and the
trustees needs to be made easily available to more people on this campus. 1 propose distribut-
ing periodic buUeti'ns from these groups by the same methods as the SGA Minutes.

In addition to dealing with various groups of people, the vice-president sik on many
committees including the Career Development Ofﬁce Committee, the Space Committee, and
Judicial Council. I would like to expand the CDO so that more students have the opportunity,
should they so desire, to receive assistance from the CDO before and after they graduate.
Grinnell students should have a well-funded resource available to which they can turn for
assistance in job placement. I am committed to obtaining funds to expand the role of the CDO

on campus, whether it be through the Fund-for—Excellcnce, the operating budget or through
President Osgood, himself.

Another long-term objective that the college needs to address is our use ofspace. The
Master Planning Committee report should Come in soon and the Grinnell College community
needs to have priorities set up to deal with the recommendations. lleel the most pressing need
on this campus is for multi-cultural space. In our increasingly diverse society, a more diverse
campus can only aid the experiential knowledge gained by the student body and this should be
our top priority. Alter that, other issues such as reforming dining services can be examined,
but my main objective as a member ofthe Space Committee would be to push for the creation
ofa new student center which would have adequate space for multi-cultural groups.

1 would like to serve as your SGA ViceeFrcsidan/Presldent ofAcademic Affairs in the
1999/2000 school year. 1 am by no means perfect, but am willing to listen to your suggestions
on how to make student government more accessible and meaningful to you. 1 would love to
talk to anyone who has questions or comments about any of this. My door is always open.
Come talk to me, I am here for you. Thank you.
