“AllLips n’ Hips" is a newKDIC
show that features first—year Neil
Martin and sophomore Aaron Dale.
The format of the progmm features
glam rock of the 1980s wrth groups
such as Person and DefLeppard. Dale
and Martin say that people do not
appreciate glam rock in the way that
it once was revered by millions of
rebellious teenagers. A recent am»
cle in SPIN Magazine which stated
that glam rock was dead prompted
the two Grinnellians to start their
own personal crusade to bring the
music back into prominence

Dale and Martin. like manyoth—
er KDlC Dis, have glam rock in their
own music collections but have found
other sources of it on campus. The
KDIC library has an extensive col—
lection of glam rock material, and
Dale insists that ifanyone is looking
{or any music of this sort they should
take a look at the tapes and CDs in
the campus bookstore. Dale insists
that “glam rock is the ‘feel good old—
ies’ of our generation," The music

hazkens hack to a time when most
orinnell students were twelve and
beginning the rebellious and con.
(using teenage years oftheir lives.

Daleand Martin have [CCClVed
many calls during their shows this
semester. This may be in tespome
to Dale's usual but amusing ran—
domness on the air and the Glam
Rock Tip oftlie Week. Tips have
ranged from advrce on how to re—
move lipstick from metallic cloth—
ing to the right way to use hair
spray. The pair would like more
people to call with requests for their
favorite glam rocksongs. Dale and
Martin would also like listeners to
call and Sing along with the songs
that they request, The pair oItEn
turns on the microphone and sings
along with the music, bui they rcar
that their voices may eventually
drive listeners away. Martin and
Dale also are requesting old issues of
the i9sosteen magazine Tigcrbeot
. They want to feature articles on
the glam rock greats of that time.

Table talk with Tom Zlabinger

You are somewhat o/a legend
here on campusiliow long have
you been here and what have you
been doing all this time;

I was a prospective in ‘58 and
my inst year at the college was in
the fall of 1990/91. Then I took
some time off for a year, came back
for two and a halfyeats, took
another semester off and now I'm
here and I’m graduating

I came here with no intention of
being a music mayor or doing any.
thing with music but I always liked
music... I've worked some for Harris
Center and recorded concerts for the
music department

1 like making music. so every
year I would learn more about the
craft, how music is made and pro.
duced, however you want to look at
Hi That’s how I know what I know
today.

What was your first expenence
in the arts at Grinnell that made you
realize that music is something you
wanted to do]

I've always loved music l’ve
always gravitated towards it. The
more 1 was around bands and musi-
cians, the more i realized that these
people are on my wavelength. To me
there‘s no better feeling than playing
music, it‘s just the best.

. . The more I’ve been involved
in music, the more I realized that it
isn‘t that impossible to get into the

music industry. sure there's been a
lotofself—c‘louht, thinkingthar I can't
posstbly he a guitarist or I can't post
sibly produce a record, but i think if
there was one experience that made
me positive that I wanted to go into
music it would be the release of

OOZE.

I had been talking about it {or
about a halfa year and when I finally
heard some ofthe tracks off of it on
the radio, I really had the feelingthat
this stuff is real. it isn‘t just noise in
a basement somewhere it‘s part of
what's really going on even though
it's on a small scale. In one way I've
always known that this is what I’ve
wanted to do, I just had to prove itto
myself.

How did HUM Productions get

started]

I had always been involved in
publications here. I was editor in
chief of the 8&8 and I had worked
for publications at my high school. i
really liked working on the newspa—
pct because you put all your energy
into this thing and you got a final
product and it‘s really cool and peor
ple read it and they go “wow'” But l
didn't want to be ajournalist I liked
workingwith people andputtingstuir
together. I liked the teamwork ener<
gy and I wanted to do something like
that,

So 1 got to thinking that there
are some cool things going on right
now wrth the Internet, multimedia,
and prices are coming down for mak—
ing CD's. ltwas like abig puzzle that

I had been assembling. i had got part
orit done and I suddenly understood
how to do the test,

1 had just been thinking about
it, the idea was baking in my mind
and then in Octobetof‘94 Jim Kropa
came up to me and he had a similar
idea We had been thinking along
thesame lines. He had beeneditorof
the 8&8, he did the Cyclone, he was
a media dude too, It iust happened.

lthinkthe backbone ofHUM is
that our skills work well together. I
think I’ve got a really good perccp.
tion or music, how its made, what
will ﬂy and won t Jim is very good at
ordering,gottingrasksdoneand keep-
ing track orstiiir. it was like, "OK
let's do a disc" and in the process or
doing002Ethiswholcentitycalled
HUM Productions developed,

Do you plan to lrccpHUM going
after you graduate]

Oh, yeah, This isourdream. It’s
what we want to do (or a living.
We'regoingtohaveourthirdcompi—
lation come out in the fall, We‘re
going to try to have a compilation
come out every fall and every spring.
Atsome point when we have enough
capital gain up we’re going to start
doing {till—lengths of bands.

it's organically growing which is
good because we learn sturi on the
way. but i don’t know where it’s
going yet, 1 can't say where we'll be
10 years down the line but we’ll be
somewhere. . . .
