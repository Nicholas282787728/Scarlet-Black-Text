Projects selected for funding, search continues

The Fund for Excellence, established last
year by the Board of Trustees, has approved
several large initial grants.

5 169,000 has already been granted to tour
separate areas ofthe college. The grants are as
follows: $35,000 to the library, $56,000 to the
community ochachets Program, 343,000 to
the Biology Department, and $50,000 to the
Career Developments office,

The Fund contains $5.7 million, etccss
from last ycar’s core budget. The amount of
the money available may vary each year, de-
pending on the endowment, but the purposes
will remain the same.

it exists for two reasons: to separate the fund
from the basic budget money that can be used
to experiment with new programs, and to use
the money on specific, focused ways to make
the college better, said Paula Smith, Asistant
Dean ofcrinnell.‘ “[The Fund] is a contradic—
tion widiin itself. They want to be careful with
the college’s money, but also use it boldly and

can compare business practices of shampoo
manufactures as well as the price and the size
ofthe bottle thanks to informational tags on
the store shelves added this year. The tags, made
by Rachel Bennett, 01, ate the result ofa years
worth ofwork and research.
“I had a more complicated rating system
last year, said Bennett,“ it was detailed on a
. sheet in the bookstore that 1 doubt anyone
bothered with. Over the summer, Bennett
tried to simplify the system by narrowing cv.
erything down into categories. using the book
Shopping ﬁr r BM" mew, published by Si-
erra club Books, Bennett broke everything
down into letter grades. “The first letter grade
- tells howenvironmentallyconscience cliccom-
pany is,” said Bennett. “The second grade,
applying itself to many issues, is an average of
the letter grades for the company's charitable
giving, community outreach, women's ad-
vancement, minority advancement, family,
workplace issues, and disclosure of informa.
tion." The last letter grade states whether the
company conducts testing on animals. As well
as a detailed sheet with company rankings,
many products are marked with labels, clearly
stating the company's position on animal test-

creativcly,” said Smith.

The Fund allows new programs to be
implemented that may not have been possible
before. it also protects Grinncll from the risk
ofany possible losses in the future ifrhc new
programs do not work or there is less money
avaliable. “irit [the amount of money] goes
down, the core programs won't be affccted,"
said Smith.

Each application is weighed against a list
of“ccntra1 values" created last year by a com-
mittee ofstudents and faculty, Also established
was a list of guidelines for applying for the
Fund, which was revised recently by President
Russell Osgood.

Smith suggests that student organizations
may want to combine ideas into larger pro-
posals rather than submitting smaller propos.

With its grant, the library plans to update
and improve its central database with a new
system for organizing records in the lnopac.
Also, some money will go to buying more

In addition to the labeling, the bookstore
has attempted to stock products that are

about items in the library. The remaining
money will be spent on various smaller addi-
tions to the libraryibooks, software, backfilc
journals, and videos that are, at present, too
expensive for the listening room's budget to
afford. The library is also creating a second
proposal to gain further funding.

The money going to the Community of
Teachers program will help support local high
school teachers, by enabling them to work with
the college to establish better programs in the
high schools.

The Biology Department will spend the
grant to improve CERA, the Conrad Environ-
mental Research Area, by purchasing more
computers and specialized equipment.

The largest grant thus far, given to the
Career Development office will help expand
the ofﬁce's ability to fund internships and re»
search opportunities, among other things.

Assosinotion target: smoking gungfor fun

“Phil started the car andi leapr orrthe hood
to the ground. The car sped away with Mark
running behind it on foot. 1 was behind teat-
ing down the street after Mark. I was running
as fast as I could, and shooting wildly..Then
Mark dove into the passenger seat ofthe car as
irwas moving and I knewl had lost him there,”
junior Padraig Johnston said,

Wild car chases with bullets ,whizzing past
your car? Blues Brothers chase scenes, Road
Warriors or Terminator II? Guess again. As-
sassinationl

Assassination is a game ofsttaregy that in.
volves seeking out a designated target and
shooting them... with a water gun. The first
game ofthe year begins September 25.

All players pay $i.00 to toward a collcc.
tive pot that the winner receives. The names
ofali players are randomly distributed among
the participants who then hunt the person they
are assigned. When someone is “shot", they
are give the name oftheir target to rheirassasa
sin and are out for the rest ofthe game. Bven.
tually, all players are dead except the winner,
who possesses all the names, The prize? All the
money in the pot, usually around 50 dollars.

Philip Allen, a junior physics major, is co-
ordinating Assassination for the second year
in a row. He’ll be working with Mike
Goodman, a sophomore. Allen was disap.
pointed in participation in the game as a ﬁrst

year, and has worked since then to increase
the popularity ofthe game. Because ofhis of.
fice, Allen does not participate as a player, but
says that he doesn't mind not playing. “(its fun
to} watch people go crazy as they play,” he said.
His role is to settle disputes that arise, handle
the money, and keep the list ofplayers names
and reassign targets when people are shot,

There are rules or the game to ensure fair
and honest play. Players may only hunt the
target assigned to them, A player may shoot
their assassin iii sclfdefense, but would be as—
sassins arc only eliminated for two hours and
then may resume playing. You can use any size
ofwarer gun that you wish, but according to
Allen, smaller ones are always easier to con»
ccal.

There are boundaries of play to ensure no
bystanders are shot and to maintain the sanity
of rho players. The dining halls, librilry, ﬁne
arts building, science labs, forum, weight
rooms, classrooms, Herrick chapel, and the
target's dorms room are all oiflimirs,

Participants vary iii the degree they wish
to get involved with the game. “My friend
Andy," remembers sophomore Bric
VnnDemark, “got 3 little too into it. He lost
all social contact."

Most participants howcvcr, are able to con
tinuc living normally as they play, but accord-
ing to sophomore Trty Bcasonover, you never
know when your assassin may be around the
corner.

“They got me while I was peeing in the
dorm bathroom,“ he said.
others have more adventurous chases with

rlicit assassins. Matty Zwikeir‘oo, recalls a
scene from playing last year, “I was tracking
my target over in smith when i saw my assasa
sin pass by on the loggia. He saw me too, sol
ran outside to get some distance. I ﬁred a few
warning shots and then started running. I was
heading toward the Forum, but he cut me off
and I was forced to try the ABH computer
labs. i ran in the door and into the back or
INSLAB. The professorsaid “Excuse me, but
we have a class going on right now,’ This was
life or death, so I told him and the class to just
give me one minute, At this they tlccidctl to
take a short break, at which time i jumped
out the window, ran as fast as I could tip Park
street, and their up the fire escape to Lnngun
third and the safety ofmy room."

The game lasts for about a work, but may
last longer ifrhcro is a stalemate between two
or three players at the end. Allcn says he has
had objections to the violence thai accompn»
nits the game,

“People think it's really cool, especially all
the funny stories that come out ofit," he says.
Allen hopes there will be a more diverse pat.

who points out such companies as Tom’s of
Maine dcodoranr as examples. Wherry also
points out the- cost by which these products

come by. “Thcyre more expensive and thars
an issue with students," she says.

Three years ago, an animal rights activist
group on campus approached the bookstore
with a request to stop selling products tested
on animals. The bookstore compiled and
stopped selling products made by Gillette and
Proctor and Gamble. The result of this was
one selection of toothpaste, as well as a severe
shortage or such products as deodorant and
tampons. When students began complaining,
the bookstore started restocking such items,
regardless orthe companys policies.

last year, Bennett brought up the idea of
makingraringsofcompaniesavailable to book.
store shoppers widrin the Environmental Ac- -
rion croup (BAG). “I rclt for a while last year
that people were buying products without ques-
tioning, or having the information to question, .
the ethics ofthe companies manufacturing the
products," said Bennett. “I knew some ofthe

, companies trespass both on environmental and

human rights and believed that people should
become more aware ofsuch abuses.“

Bennett hopes the labeling will encourage
students to think twice before they buy. "Over-
comingiaeiness and habit is a hard thing to do
but essential ifpeople are going to start mak-
ing choices that go beyond themselves,” says
Bennett. “The environment can give us a lot
ofthings, and i don't thinkwc should give that
up for anything, especially not for instantly
gratifying materialistic wants."
