The current social welfare system
is “fighting an uphill battle" in trying
to serve the needsof today’spoor. So
says Dr. Robert Haveman, who has
designed a new welfare system that
he believes will “promote equality
and simultaneously promote effi-
cieney.

“The old social welfare system is
obsolete, not up to the task of meeting
the social needs for the 1990's,” said
Professor Haveman, who taught in
Grinnell’s economics department for
eight years.

Haveman gave a talk entitled
“Starting Even — New Policy for the
Nation’s New Poverty” as the com-
memorating lecture at the awarding
of the Gilbert Ft DeBartoto Memo-
rial Prize in Economics. Currently a
Professor of Economics and Public
Policy at the University of Wiscon-
sin, Haveman lectured on the ideas
developed in his book Starling Even,
focusing on a new approach to the
nation‘s poverty problem

Haveman explained that, due to
the change in the composition of the
Americanpoor, the present social
policy is ineffective. Programs such
as Welfare, Social Security, Food
Stamps and Public Housing, at the
timethey were created, were meantto
he “a hand up - not a hand out."
Because of their nature as income
transfers and the change in the consti-
tution of recipient groups, these poli-
cies have become more of a “hand-
out"

‘This program has dis-incentive
effects People work less and are less
innovative in taking care of them-
selves,” he said.

Because of the sorry state of the
economy and the subsequent caution
of American leaders, Haveman said
there is“littte innovation and creative
thought" in the planning of today’s
welfare policies about “how it could
be more efficient and effective.”

The current welfare system tare
gets the needs of the poor of 25 years
ago, i.e. the elderly, the rural poor,
iniactblackfamilies andpoor females.
Haveman argued that these groups
are not domg so badly today. The
new face of poverty includes minorr
ityyouths;singterpnrent,mothcronly
families; and children.

“These new poor are not effccr
iiwiy helped bya social policy wlicrc
tilt‘Omt: redistribution is the main
thrust, ‘ h said. “The nztlion needs a
new way of doing busineSs,” one
which would equalize opportunities
for the newpoortnstezill oi equalizing
income.

To target these groups, Haveman
suggests five components for a new
social policy. The first component is
a refundable tax credit larger than the
taxliability offarniliesatthepoverty-
line thatcorrectly reﬂects the size and
composition of these families Sec-
ondly, he proposes a national, univer-
sal child support system, regulated
through the tax system, with fixed
amount to be withheld from the ab
sent parent’s paycheck and paid to
the custodial parent. He also calls for

t F EATURE S +
New policy needed for the new poor

Last Monday, Professor Robert Haveman outlined his plan for
a new welfare system to serve the needs of the new poor.

a restructuring of the lowrskill labor
market through the use of employer-
oriented tax incentives and wagerrate
subsidies.

The fourth componentof his policy
isauniversal-personalcapitalaccount
which sets aside money (he suggested
$15,000) for every 18 year»old to be
used in any approved purchase of
training, education or health care.
lastly, Haveman proposes a standard
retirement benefit Social Security
program which would pay those of
retirement age benefits equal to the
poverty line and no more.

Haveman said these programs will
increase equality of opportunity by
reallocating resources from the com-
paratively well-off elderly to youths
whilepromoting longer workinglives,
creating employment incentives, in»
creasing individualresponsibilityand
assuring that no elderly are living
below the poverty line.

He admitted that his ideas do not
take into account healthcarc forchilr
dren, childcare, public education, or
drug policy. Haveman also said that
with any changeasgreatas the onehe
proposes for the welfare system,some
people are bound to be hurt.

“No change you could make will
leave everybody better off,“ said
Haveman,stressing the need for Lt‘anA
siiional safety net programs, such as
keeping those over 50 on the current
SocialSecuritysystem andenactinga
transitional system for citizens ages
30-50.

Haveman said his program calls
for a radical change in welfare poncy
but argued that “if you don’t ituni.
about a new way of doing l‘ltSlll" '
you will never ehtingc mu m
iiicnially.”

Mark Montgomery, assistant pro»
fessor of economics at Grinnell, be-
lieves that Haveman's proposal holds
great potential.

“Haveman understands the we]—
fare system as well as any econo-
mist," he said.

Montgomery doesn't expect that
Haveman’s program will he imple-
mented in its entirety. ”T here’s a real
entrenched bureaucracy,“ he said,
adding“ihe proposal's purpose is to
provide a blue-print for the direction
we should move"

ery said, “Bit by bit, we have re-

‘The need for reforms is being

Indian writers portray

the modern

By Julie Kaster

“Give women greater decision
power over domestic spheres, chili
dren, and literature - let them deeide
the deﬁnition of ‘modemity.‘" said
Mridula Garg, New Delhi author and
economist in her recent talk on “No-
tions of Modernity: Facts and Fic-
tions in Indian Women’s Writing.”

Garg’s lecture, sponsored by the
NounProgram,addressedthechanges
inbom the imageofwomen in Indian
literature and the literature written by
women. She chaned the historical
portrayals of Indian women begin-
ning with folk tales and ending with
modern ﬁction.

In these works, mainly written by
men, Garg notes the absence of fe»
male protagonists despite the strong
societal image of “woman as war-
rior.” She added that women’s tradi-
tional dilemma is aspiring to the im-
age of mother and provider but pos-
sessing the self~image of woman
warriorr

‘The first women writers [of the
1950’s] depicted women as self~sac-
riﬁcing mystics just as they had ex,
isted in earlier literature,“ Garg said,
Even in modem literature, Indian
women writers are showing some
hesitancy in discussing women‘s
sphere outside of the home.

Garg equated journalism with
teaching women about their rights to
property, abortion, and divorce She
commented that “once women be»
came aware of their rights, they re-

woman

belled against the men they were in
relationships with. not the socio-eeo-
nomic structures.”

The concerns of the third world
were also addressed in Garg’s lee“
ture. Garg explained that class
struggles often take precedence over
gender struggles in India. “For many
women, concerns of gender are a
luxury,"shesaid. Third worldwomen
are generally portrayed as victims by
modem authors of both genders.

“For many women,
concerns of gender are a
luxury.”

- Mridula Garg

Modem Indian women writers are
mainly upper-middle class which
makes it difficult for them to accuv
rately describe third world women’s
experience. “Much of what is being
written today is spectator writing -
modern women are writing from nos—
talgia or what they’ve read about In-
dia and not what they themselves
have felt or understood," Garg said.

Garg‘s talk concluded with a de-
scription of the presentstateof Indian
women writers. She mentioned the
growing acceptance of women’s lit-
erature, and the transcendence of the
single woman writer stereotype.

Mridula Garg has published 13
books and is on the board of direcwts
of the Centre of Science and Environ-
ment.
