Minority Scholar works to bridge gaps of all kinds

By Holly Pfitsch

VEN when I was five or six
E years old. if there was any
conﬂict, I was out there mak-
ing peace, getting people to hug and
kiss and get along," said Dr. Ann
Stanford. Dr.Slanford was on campus
last week as a Minority Scholar and
Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fellow. She
is a former U.S. Foreign Service Of»
Iicer and was most recently Consul
General in Lyon, France. 5 he has also
been an Administrative Officer in the
us. Embassy in Nairobi. Kenya. On
campus she spoke in classes and gave
two talks, “Careers in Foreign Ser~
vice" and“TheImpactof Public Policy
on Minorities and Women.“

All herlife, Dr. Stanford has been
breaking baniers fun-nod by racism
arldsexism in careers and public policy.
She has moved into many positions
that were previously closed to women
or minorities, and started programs
and policies that helped others do the

arm. While she knew all her life that
she would do something special. her
first experience breaking baniers was
when she and her husbandlived on the
U5. base inIapan. All oftheir ﬁ'iends
had moved onto the base and found
their apanrnentsbeautifully furnished.
Upon moving into her own aparunent,
she foundnolhing. “Iwassoangryand
so startled. I was weeping hysteri-

ally. Icouldrr‘t understand the phe
nomenon of racism." Dr. Stanford did
not passively accept the simation.
“Something clicked inside of me. I

. ked to the base commander and he
said he would take care of it. I decided
at that moment that I would never
accept less because of the color of my
skin." That experience began a life-
timeofworkforcquality forallpcople.

Dr. Stanford describes herself as
a “change agent. Let’s live in har-
mony," she said, “let’s give people
what they have aright to. Let’s estab-
lishand enforcean entitlement. That’s
what I've done" She has worked in
intornationalrelations andpublicpolicy
in many parts oftheUnited States and
foreign countries. in Kenya, she con-
vinced the ambassadors -»all men»- to
include their wives in their discus-
sions In France, as Consul General,
she brought together groups of people
who previously had notcommunicated.
“I builta team. Ialsobegan todelegale
responsibility to lower level employ-
ees-—lhat isn't done enough.”

 

prim-o: PUBLIC RELATIONS

Dr. Ann Stanford

Dr. Stanford has advice forothers
attempting to break down the barriers
set by racism and sexism. “Believe in
yourself, have faith in yourself. Bc~
lieve in your principles and values.
This will set up a conviction in you of
how you‘regoinglolive and the things
that you will protest When ilbecomes
a way of life. you don’t have another
choice," She recognizes that ﬁghting
for these convictions will not be easy.
”l‘here is some pain and suffering in
volvcd in opening doors that haven’t
been opened before.“ She believes
that if there is something you really
want, you have to focus on it. “Your
blindelsareon. You'relooking straight
ahead. There's a goal for you that’s
never been done. But you go ahead.”
She warns against procrastinating. “If
it’s to be done, get up and do it If
you’redoing something differentwith
your life W dive into it!”

In her talk on “The Impact of
Public Policy on Minorities and
Women”, Dr. Stanford outlined some
grim statistics. She compared situa-
tions forminoritiesand women in 1967
and 199]. Ultimately,zrfterexamining
housing, education, and employment,
not much has changed. In fact, the gap
between white women‘s and black
women’s salaries has actually in-
creased. “Idon'tthinkAmericaknows
that we haven’t progressed much.
We‘re no better off than we were in
'67." Thatisadevastating prospect for
someone who has spent her entire life
ﬁghtingforcivilrights,butDr.Stanford
is trying to be positive. “Are the prob
lems so big that they can’t be sur-
mounted? Isubmittoyou that theycan

be [surmounted] -- and that it starts

In both hertalk and this interview,
Dr. Stanford expressed her belief in
the power of the individual. ”I'he
strength of self-advocacy has to come
from within,” she said. Her work and

ideas can serve as a source of inspira-
tion for everyone. As far as her own
future. right now she‘s at a standing
point. “I‘ve done everything I wanted
to do! Now I’m in a dilemma." She is

keep on working for her convictions
and take personal satisfaction in her
successes, ‘There‘s neveranightl put

for me. I find a peace with that."

 

 

Letters from the Old World .

Part VI—Nightlife
By Riva Sharples,

I fust arrived at Lancaster “Uni," as the English blokes call the university, I thought nightlife

‘ ;‘ ’ here was going to be rather dull. Although there are nine pubs on campus and an endless number

of pubs scattered around the town itself, all of them close by 10:30 pm. every day in accordance with

national law. At frrsl,l was shocked to find pubs closing at such an hour (Why. that'sjustaboutthe time I slartthinlcing

about heading down to the State Street Station back in Gnnnelll), butI quickly discovered that pubs here are only

a wannrup to the hardcore English nightlife of dance clubs that stans late and canies on until the wee hours of the
moming. English nightlife is anything but dull -- if you are into dancing and nightclubs.

The first club I attended was the Carleton Inn in nearby Morecambe. I was one of 300 lucky studean who
actually got a bus ticket to go. Lancaster University is located three miles outside of town and regularcity bus service
doesn’t run after midrtight, so dance clubs in the area often run special buses to and from the university on popular
student nights, like Mondays and Wednesdays. If you don’t get a ticket, you can still go to the club, but must get
there on your own. Taxis charge timerandahalf after midnight, so most people opt for the bus.

English bloke I‘ve also noticed thatwomen do not go up and talk to men much, but wait for men to come to them.

Dancemusic istechnoandhip—hop. Anything from the70's ispopularas areearly limes by dlelackson Five, Stevie

English are very reserved in general, and dancing is no exception. They rarely use their hands when they dance arldtmd

Lancaster University surdens religiously attend the Empire Dance Club in Morecambe on Wednesday nighs. I

Square), andboard the bus. In Mormimbe, weallpileoutagiin and go to ulepublocatednext to lheelubandagain drink
cider and strong beer until the doors oflhe club open at 10:00 pm.

Another American from Georgia and I went to the Equinox Dance Club in Manchester (about two hours away
from Lancaster) on a Friday night. It opened at midnight and was open until 9:00 a.m., pumping out dance tunes,
butmy friend andl only made it until 3:30 am. TheEquinox was located in a basementbelow apub. It was incredibly
crowded and so smoky from cigarettes, marijuana and the artiﬁcial smoke that rose from the dance floor every few
minutes that we could barely see one another. There were people dancing everywhere: on tables, chairs, speakers
and the dance floor itself. Clothing ranged from topless to the Madonna look—alike bodysuit, complete with steel-
locd combat boots. We saw a few people doing illegal drugs like cocaine and many more doing “peppers," a legal
drug in England sold over the counter in nightclubs and shops that seems to have an effect somewhat like speed.

Nightlife is great here as long as you enjoy dancing, disco and meat markets. If you don't. I really don't know
where you would go or whatyou would do after 1 1 :00 pm. because it seems nightclubs areTI-IE enlenairunent for
young people. I still can’t believe that pubs close at 10:30 pm and I don‘t think I’ll ever get used to the idea. So,
the suange English ways of doing things and my struggles and frustrations with them will be the subject of next
week‘s letter. Until then, keep dancing!
