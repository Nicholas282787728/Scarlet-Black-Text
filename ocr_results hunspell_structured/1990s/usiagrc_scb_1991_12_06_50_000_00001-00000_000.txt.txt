H / GRC renamed

Stonewall

By Kim Eckan

"there was a difference between
the two signs for the Human/Gay
Resource Center. The sign in front of
the door read, “Human/Gay Resource
Center," However, thc Sign on Eighth
Avenuercad,“HumachsourccCcn-
tor." One can interpret this difference
as one chooscs, but to many members
ofthe campuslcsbigaycommunity, it
represents not only an obvious dis;
tinction between the terms human
and gay, it also reveals the college‘s
effort to overlook the existence of
homosexuals on campus.

This Saturday, the l-l/GRC will be
renamed tthloncwall Ccntcr, in roc-
ognition of a three-day series of riots
outsidc the Stonewall, a gay bztr in
Grocnwich village, that spawned the
lcsbigaymovcmcntinlunc1969.Thc
Cantor will be officially rcnamcd at a
formal ceremony in South Loungc at
1:30, with opening rcmarks by Presi-
dentFerguson. The cvcntwill fcaturc
a ribbon-cutting at the Center and a
presentation/discussion of the video
“Beyond Stonewall." The ceremony
is geared toward the entire campus
community as a showing of suppon
for lesbigays.

According to Rod Brown, head of

N THIS ISSUE

Center

the soon-Io-be Stonewall Center, the
renaming of the Center represents a
change of focus and a more concen»
trated emphasis on lesbigay issues;
previously, the H/GRC has also prov
vidcd information on “human" cons
ccrns such as alcohol awareness, cat-
ing disorders, ctc. Now, however, the
Center will expand its library only for
lesbigay publications, videos and
other resources and will attempt to
provide more programming for the
homosexual community. More im-
portantly, Brown said, the center will
be a place where all campus gay
groups can meet.

However, with the new focus on
thcprovision oflcsbigay information
and rcsourccs, Brown stressed that
thc rcnoming and issue expansion of
the Stonewall Ccntcr does not raptor
sent an exclusion of the campus hctr
croscxual community. “Tho name
change is more inclusive than people
think," he said, “The Ccntcr exists to
provide information on lesbigay is-
sues to the entire campus commu~
nity.“

Brown also noted that Lhc renam-
ing of the Center represents an em-
phasis on lcsbigziys of color—an em-

the swift response by the police fol—
lowing the ﬁrst incident. “We ar—
rested thcm, had the court date set,
had them in jail and posting bond
within two days ofthcincidcnt," said
Boycr.

Boycr also ercsscd that he is at-
tcmpting to send a message to meme
bcrs oftho community who would be
involved in such acts. “We would like
to not only respond swiftly, but also
we would like to soc the courts hand
down stiffer penalties including big

fincs, a lot of community service at

the collcgc, ajail sentence, as well as
probation,” said Boyer.

In rcsponsc to the second attack,
Boyer expressed concom about stu-
dents taking the law into their own

hands. “Vigilantism is something for
when the law has failed, and I don‘t

know how much quicker we could

have been there. My disappointment

is that knowing how much the stu-
dents detest such bohavior, they cl‘

lowed themselves to fall down to that

level " said Bo er.

“We have been doing regular foot
patrols on campus, but we will not
have ofﬁcers on campus on a pcrrna-

thatthe students will contactusor the

that we can put some of this garbage

Army War College lecturers

address Midd

By Sharyn Obsatz

The United States should offer the
Middle East ”guidance from afar,"
according to Lieutenant Colonels Dan
Dcvtin and Jim Ward, students of the
Army WarCollcgc. Devlin and Ward
gave a “practitioner's perspective"
on US. policy in the Middle East ata
talk Wednesday sponsored by the
Roscnftcld Committcc.

A Middle East specialist in the
Army, Ward believes that the US.
has two main interests in the arca:
protection of American access to oil
and protection of Israel. The end of
the cold war has not changed these
two interests, rattler, it has changed
the threat to US. interests.

He said tth.S. relations with the
Middle East used to be "anchored in
a deterrence policy against the Soviet
Union" and a “containment policy
toward Iran." Today, our policy cans

tcrs around encouraging regional sta-
bility as a means to guamntceregion-
ally security, economic growth and
arms control, according to Ward.

Wardbclievrs thanheUSshould
take a more subtle role in promoting
regional security in the Middle East
than it has in the past, arguing that
direct involvement in the past had
“downed progress and increased in»
stability." “Arab nations do not want
any ouLsidc interference.“ said Ward.

Devlinpointcd to PresidentBush‘s
promotion of the current peace talks
asaway the US. can “actasacalalyst
to see that action happens.“ Never-
theless. he agreed with Ward‘s asser-
tion that “We cannot dictate our will
in the establishment of a regional
security arrangement.”

The US. should also be promot—
ing democracy in the area, said Ward.
