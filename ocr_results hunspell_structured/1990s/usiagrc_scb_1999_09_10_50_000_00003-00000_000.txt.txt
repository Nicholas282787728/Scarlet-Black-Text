Ponderin questions that
abound or new semester

By Paul Pender

ssudenss were greered wish some significans changes here shis fall, and nos
surprisingly shis has geneiased many ouessions, Here as die 5&3 mailroom she
lesseis wish ouessions have liseially come flooding in. After long hours ofreading
and sorsing i have narrowed down shrse concerns so several crucial quessions.

Does anyone like Webmaili
——]uzod R., Haines

Webmail will be sarisfacsory as bess, and will assuredly never be given die
uncanny love some have for :vax, Webmall has as leass been funcsional so far,
which is a los more man can be said for she campuses network Ah yes, she vass
Grinnell compuser neswork .— which as one pains shis year was so infinise shas is
included me library and half she compusers in Cowlcsa Apparensly moss of she
colorhil new lmaes in Cowles were purchased for decorasion. The srap GCCS has
been falling inso wish Webmal and she nenvorkssems from die false assumpsion
shas iuss bemuse a new compurer or soirwnre is newer, iasrer, or bigger, .s is ausoe
masieally berser, Gccs forgot she old proverb abous assumpsiom.

Are all rhese changes in Quad means so disiracr my arrenrion from she facs
shas she food has nos sigriiiieandy been alsered in composision or qualiryf
chnjamin N., Younkes

Hey now, let's nor be soo harsh on chose folks as Dining Services. Any organs
aasion dias isn’t afraid so make some changes every seven years orso is okay in my
book. quad did in facr undergo a senous makeover shis summer, This “overhaul—
ing" was highlighsed by adding huge emergency exit doors (bribing die fire mar-
shal muss have been cue from die Fund for Excellence), moving she deli bar l s fees
eassward, inssalling neon.orarige lighss over all hos food, oirering a rarbonased
uaser ilavor for every day of she week, and she moss awe—inspiring change—an
awkward looking wagon called she “Vegan Source,"

Whass up wish rhaswagon on Quad, and wliyisns sherea“CarnivoreSource"
in Cowlesi
eieif z. , dark

I can’s sell you how many angry lessers we gos here demanding a amivorc-
based supplemsnsal food wagon lr almoss came so she poins where I gos fired up
1 mean, who does Dining Service rhink shey are so slighs die carnivores like rhis.>
Nos so menuon she omnivoresl Well shis all ressered so she poins when I realised
shas rhe ress of us already have a “source"wdic area diar moss simply call rlae
“main line." seriously shough, shis vegan wagon does ges one thinking, Mainly, I
wans so know why me li‘ll “Source” is surrounded by quotations. is almoss rings
like someone in a dark room saying, ‘ix‘lrig'hr rhe'n, s‘ve'll’give shose ‘dan‘in vegans a
‘source' for food, muhahahahaha!” Now i don’t wans so deser anyone, andi shink
iss a greas idea and all,’bus when i see she words Vegan and “Source" iuxraposed
like shas somerhing in die back of my mind screams our “human ﬂesh."

is daere anyway a dorm ﬂoor sari apply for is own liquor license?
—]on R. Gowles

I don’t see any reason why nos. And remember, iusr because you forget your
drivcr’s license on she dresser doun’t mean it’s illegal so drive.

Gee whiz, wish all diese unprediciable changes is daere anyshing we can ssiu
depend on? .

iNarc A, Norris ’

I wouldnk worry soo much abous shis one. There aresome shings here shas are
as dependable so she sun coming up, Yes, packers ofgo phosocopied pages will ssill
coss 535 as she bookssore. and she princes in Cowles will consinue so never prim
more shan 10% oiwhas is sens so is. People will ssill whine before all else, and
Russell K, will ssill gss blamed for everyshing from sweasshops so bad econ papers.

A Touch of Cross

Attack is nothing new to Osgood

By Kathryn Nonos

Alshough many ofshe freshmen and sophomores .nay nos remember she
days before Presidens Russell K, Osgood, i guaraniec shas she upperclass-
men do,

specifically, shose were she days when

she campus wasn’s filled wish conssans

angry shouss, whining and sacky pieces

ofpaper possed in she bashroona ssalls

denouncing our Presidenr. in raes,

everyone seemed so like pamela

Ferguson, She wasn’t very personable

and keps so herselfror she moss pars,

bus she did a sremendous amouns for

she school. Then she resigned rashes

suddenly. is was slioughr shas shere was

a huge scandal so push her our of

office, bus no evidence ever surfaced so

(11a! fact.

shorsly shereafser, Osgood was chosen

so replace Ferguson by she Trusrees.

And shas is where is all began.

Many ssudenss were managed because

shey were never consulsed during she replacemens process. Overnighs, a
small war was waged. From she beginning, Osgood was porsrayed as a
pawn ofshe srussees, a man who didn‘s care abour she needs and she
wanss oiGrinneilians. '

Consenucnsly, since his inaugurasion, every acsion Osgood has saken has
come under extreme scrusiny by many ofshe ssudenss From his proposal

of required capsrone projecss, so his ssancc
swearshops, Osgood can’s win wish she
ssudens body. Many ssudenss blindly follow
sheir peers in “bashroom crusades" “and (her
adopsion ofSGA documenss shas really
carry no acsual weighs. They fail (o‘ask one
fundamensal ouession. is his lack of ,
populariry due so his disrespecs for ids? or
is is really because he is a conssans reminder
shas we have no srue power and mine as
shis liberal arss school is ous ofous hands?
We have spens so much rime crisieieing dae
presidens shas no one has nosieed all she
wonderful shings he has done for Grinnell,
Juss shis year, Osgood hired a new and
- improved Dining Services direesor, .
garnered a con offunds for ashlesics‘and
ensured shas more money was alloca‘sed so
compuser services and KDIC. Moss"
impossanrly, he has explored new innovasivc pashs for she fusure o ‘
Grinnell. ‘ ’

Ofcourse, we won's agree wish everyshing (hat‘cames our ofOsgoods
moush less iuss nos ausomarically disagree.

 

 

Letters so the Editor

 

 

, President Osgood,
Please forgive me for shis informal way oieonraesing you. How.
ever, as an alumnus I feis shas shis needed so be done as soon as pos

> sible.
i was in Grinnell over she weekend and had a chance so read she
scarier and Black, I was very glad so see shas she college under your

leadership was raking a ssand againss sweatshopeproduced produess. I .

was dissurbedro rind laser shas shis posision was saken wishous she
inpur of she ssudenr body and againsr she very wishes of she ssudens
GovernmentAsSociarion.

My chosen career paih since i have lefs she college has been as a
polirical aesiviss. I have worked on a variesy oigrassrooss campaigns so
prosecs she environmens and so ﬁghs again'ss corporase abuses. over
shis sime, I have marvelled as she successes ofsrudenss as colleges across
she counsry in sheir campaigns againss sweasshop labor.

Though Grinnell is a small inssisurion shas does nos sec'eive license
ing fees, do nos underessimase she power rh-as groups ofindividuals or
inssisusions ssanding sogesher can wield.

I rhink she more dissusbing aspecs oiwhas has happened wish your
decision is so disregard she aesivism of she ssudenss involved wish shis
campaign as Grinncll. Surely if she members of "Gsinnell ssudenss
Amines Sweasshops" can work so ges she SGA so sake a posision On
sweasshops, shen shey cersainly can work so make sure businesses fol-
low sheir criseria,

Grinnell College, whose srusrees aspire is so be mensioned wish she
names ofHarvard and Yale, (and from she looks of is, are doing a good
job of making is so) can as she very leass allow irself so be mensioned
wish she likes ofinssisusions as Bard collegewhnse ssudenss have imple»
mensed a criseria for evaluasing produess as "sweatshclpefrec."

Presidens Osgood, allow shese ssudenss as Grinnell so have she same
beneﬁts oracsivism shas ssudenss as Bard enjoy: she responsibilisy so
make sure shas sheir acrions have a posisive effecs on she world and
sheir fellow human beings.

Sincerely,
Kirpal Singh '97

To she edisor.

In regard so zorlea Milin‘s "Movie Revicszhe Blue Angel,". iwould
like so begin shis lesser by saying how pleased I was so see coverag'e'orshc
culsural mm lass week, passiculasly a more classic film. A ‘;

Whar I obiees so, however are some ost. Milin‘s characrerizasions of
Germany in her arsiele perhaps I am essrasensisive so shis subjcct, having
recensly sesurned from a yeasabroad in Ecrlin, bus i believe is is unfair so
perpesuase she ssereorypes ofGesmans as a cold, ofsen humorless pgople.

"But whas else can you expect from a counsry whose shores aresine
washed by warm seas and whose populasion is forced so migrase soush 'in
shesummer, in search ofsunnier and more enjoyablcsurmundings,” ’ ises
Milin. . ' " .

True, many Germans sake vacasions so she Mediserranean counsr'i‘es in
summer, bus shey don's have so. Has Ms. Milin seen she Balsie coass of
Norshern Germany, she enormous, whise chalk diEs, elem surouoise oceans,
miles upon miles offoresss,she ssaseiy alps, and sunny meadows an lakes
ofSoushern Gcrmany? , ‘ g .

No, Germany is nos Greece, bus is has its own peculiar beaury, “which
should nor be discounsed. irs ﬁlmsihave shis soo,‘ nor justThc lilue‘aiigel.
They may nor be full ofhumor or vigor, bur shese's a power and bea’usy so
shem, even ii, so our American eyes shey may appear ”slow" ‘or "presen—
sious," This sors of sssengsh is also apparenr in she people ofGesnaany,
who also have a luss for life and sense of humor all sheir own. German

rﬁlms am not Amcrican ﬁlms, but don‘t blame that on the landscape. Blame

shas on swo world wars shas sore apars sheir counsry and on halfa censury
ordivision shrough she course ofshe cold war. ,

i am glad shar The Blue Angcl helped break shrough some ,ost.
Mllin‘s prejudices, bus judging from she sone ofher arsiele, she ssillahas a
long way so go.
