TREISTMAN: Reﬂections on MAGILL: Columnist criticizes focus of

attitudes toward women

They told herthat she wanted it. They
didn't listen when she screamed, and
it is inane to claim that she should
have been more responsible and ei»
titer drunk less beer that night, left
earlier or fought harder. Am I saying
that her behavior was intelligent? is
this even relevant? I don‘t know ei-

By saying that women need to
monitor their drinking, we are setting
ourselves up to allow blame to be
placed on the woman. What comes
after watching alcohol? Do we need
to be careful about what we wear,
who we talk to, how we carry our»
selves? This self-awareness is critical
for protection. Is it reasonable? Is it
fair?

Does any of that matter?

thatbureaucracy often does at least as
much harm as good to the people it is
designed to help. The new Conservar
tives, NeorConservatives or, asl like
to call them, Gestapo Conservatives,
seem to march to a very different
drum. Their basis is not a coherent
philosophy based on the real prinr
ciples of such thinkers as William F.
Buckley, but rather on the simple
belief that if George Herbert Walker
Bush says it, or does it, it must be
gospel. As a result, Nee-Conservar
tives, like my fellow commentator
Mike Washbum, can argue in these
pages for a true meritocracy. but at

the same time argue that Clarence‘

not surprising that students graduatv

to start running south to join their
