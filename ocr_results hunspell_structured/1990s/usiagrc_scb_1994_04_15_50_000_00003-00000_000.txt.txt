Grocery store mystique

By Brett Fechheimer

UPERMARKETS, the bigger
and brighter the better, have
workedtheirspecial magicon
every category of postwar Ameri»
cana, from architecture to literature.
In tlle 1950‘s, Allen Ginsberg fanta—
sized about striding through a neon-

 

lit supermarket with Walt Whitman,
“tastingartichokes, possessing every
frozen delicacy. and never passing
thecashier.” In the‘60’s,loan Didion
wore a bikini to an LA. supermarket
one sweltering Sunday, only to be
chased“all over the store, to the Jun-
ior Foods, to the Dairy Products, to
the Mexican Delicacies" by a muu—
mun-clad woman who yelled at her:
“Whatathing to wearto themarketl”
And in the ‘70’s, Armistcad Maupin
lovingly described the produce-sec-
tion pickaup rituals which had earned

 

San Francisco‘s Marina Safeway a
reputation as “the hottest spot. in
town,”

Grinnelldoesn'thave supermar»
kets with such verve and promise.
Nevertheless, the town’s four major
markcs do have their own distinct
personalities. Those of you witllout
cars probably know McNally‘s (at
102] Main St.) well, butdo you also
know that beyond its charming mi;
licu awaits a whole new shopping
universe for you to explore?

wiminwalkingdistanceofcam»
pus isFareway (at6th Ave. and Spring
St), arguably the supermarket with
which Grinnell College students are
the least familiar. That’s a pity, be
cause going there is a bit like step-
ping into Mr. Peabody’s Wayback

machine and traveling through time
to 1962. Fareway has baggers who
sport spiffy white uniformsand crew
cuts, a meat counter with live men
behind it who weigh tlle meatto your
precise speciﬁcation and checkout
people (invariably young women)
who say out loud the price of each
item as they punch the number into
their manual cash registers Shop-
ping in Faraway can be an adventure
in nostalgia, and often the prices are
lower there than at McNally’s.
Drive west on Highway 6 to the
very edge of town and you come to
Food—4—Less. a supermarket which
wants you to believe that it charges
for less than its competitors simply
because customers are required to
bag their own groceries. Shopping
there can be economical, but some
times the price difference is negli»

glble, For instance, a sixrounce box
of lime Jellro costs 78 cents at Food-
AVLcss, At Fareway tlle same box is
a penny higher, but young guys with
crew cuts will put it in a sack foryou.

Still, the warehouserlike atmo-
sphere of FoodA-Less has a certain
appeal. Usually that supermarket
(the hlp simply call it “Food”) is tlte
leastcrowded ofthe four irl town. At
2:00 a.m., while wandering its

Twenty-four hours a day, FoodA-

Stylistically similar to Foodxti
Less is HyaVee. Located on High»
way 146 on the south end of town.
Hy-Vee impresses me more than any
otherGrinncll supermarket. Without

but those of you who have cars and

ing out on a good thing. Months ago,
Hy-Vee charged a dollar for waxed—
paper sacks ﬁlled withdelicious day-
old donuts, and one of my few regrets

about the place is that they appear to
have discontinued that practice.

There’s much to admire about
Hy»Vee. Their “deli" offers an ex-
tensive supply of salads and chicken
parts, as well as an evening smorgas-
bord (“all you can eat") for a mere
$3.99, The other patrons at the Hy-
Vee deli make the experience of cat-
ing there all the more enjoyable. At
the college, it's easy for one to forget
that we are surrounded by what is
basically a gigantic farm until one
eats with and listens to the people
who tend to its crops.

The prices at Hy-Vee are com—

be why so many professors shop at
McNally‘s, In fact, I‘ll leave you a
bit of advice: if you want to avoid
running into your profs, shop at
Fareway.

Letters from the Old World

Part IX—Amsterdam
By Riva Sharples

 

 

FI'ER a stressful week of battling Willi the ancient Lancaster University card catalog, ﬁghting for a
computer in the university’s cramped computer room and pulling several all—nighters,l handed in my
final papers for the term and headed off on a month—long gallivant through Europe. Like most

Americans studying abroad, Iplanned to use the month of vacation between terms to see as much of Europe
as possible. The British men living downstairs liked to make fun of me (and all other Amelicans attempting
to see Europe in such a short period of time) and called me “Miss Europe—in-Two-Weeks.”

My friend Adam and I started out our European tour in Amsterdam, infamous home of sex and drugs. The
city lived up to its name. After gathering upour baggageand struggling to carry itthrough the lack of Amsterdam
immigration (they didn’t even look at our passporlsl), we stepped out of the airport to hail a cab. We hadn’t
been out of the airport five minutes when we were accosted by men selling all kinds of drugs. They approached
us boldly and whispered, “Cocaine, marijuana, heroin -- you want it, I’ve got it Good prices." They cameout
of every comer, every turn, every street, and we would no sooner shrug off one when another would approach.

Adam and I stayed in a shabby, nln-down hotel located on a narrow street crowded with street vendors.
coffee shops and sex shops. We climbed the narrow stairs to our room, deposited our baggage, were offered
“the best" marijuana (our hotel had it for sale), and then took off walking down one of Amsterdam’s busiest
boulevards, Damak Street. We hadn’t walked more than two blocks when we came across the Sex Museum.

The museum was not a joke. It contained all kinds of historical and modern sex toys (including a whole
room devoted to sand—m), hundreds of sexual photogmphs, working peep shows, various displays of replica
whorehouses and sex shops and two 7»foot penises, on which one could sit and have a picture taken.

Just down the street from the Sex Museum, two blocks off of Damak Street, was the Red Light District.
It too lived up to its name. Because it ls illegal for prostitutes in Amsterdam to stand on the street, they instead
stand insidebigpicturewindows, clad in scanty lingerie, ared lightglowingon theirskin. Thoseinterested stroll
casually past the numerous windowsand the women display themselves as if they were on acatwalk ata fashion
show, Ifa person is interested in a particular girl, he taps on the window and she will come to the doorand give
her price. Thered lights denote shops open forbusiness. Drawncunains mean thatacustomeris currently being
segved. In between the glowing red windows are numerous sex shops where you can purchase anything from
magazines to videos to toys, peep shows, live sex acts and the occasional coffee shop

There were coffee shops on every street comer. We went into several and each time were immaiiately
brought a menu of the about 20 different kinds of marijuana and hash available. Most of the shops reminded
me of Bob’s Underground before it got new lighting and was remodeled last year; small, dimly-lit, psychedelic
posters and paintings on the walls and Bob Marley and 60‘s tunes playing in the background.

Everything in Amsterdam seemed to revolve around sex and dmgs. Even our Let’s £39 E [m book
mentioned the phallic national symbol. Although it was probably not designed to be so, the long white obelisk
structure is seen as a symbol of Amsterdam’s darker side,

Adam and I spent two days in Amsterdam and then we climbed onto an overnight train headed for Venice,
Italy. Our adventures on that train and our stay in Venice will be the subject of next week‘s letter. Until then,
take care and greetings from Europe!
