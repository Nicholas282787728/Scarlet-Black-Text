Saturday, Grinnell’s arch-rival
Knox came into town undefeated in
conference play and looking to upset

the Pioneers. However, it was not to
be as the Grinneltians used their
“dominant left side and opportunis-
tic level of play" to carry them past
the Siwash, 571. The game was
highlighted by Anya Schwartz's hat
trick ofthree and single goals by Erin
Kilgore and Fraboni.

to play them better than we did at out
place last year when we lost 2-0,"
saidEskildsen. ”Gustavus isadefenr
sivc-mlnded, well-coached, hard-
nosed soccer team, so we’ll have to
play at peak performance to be in a
position to win.” The Pioneers will
take on conference foe Illinois Col-
lege in a rematch here Sunday.
