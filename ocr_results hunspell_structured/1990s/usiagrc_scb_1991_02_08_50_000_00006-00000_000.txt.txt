Miscommunication LETTERS To THE EDITOR

aggravates debate

The Disco Week resolution has created a lot of ztrgument on campus.
Yet very little has been said about its actual content, For that was what was
hurtful to many upset black, gay and lesbian, and Jewish students.

Unfortunately, the manner in
whichCBS showed theirdiscontent Staff
Editorial

last weekend alienated a large
section of campus. Many students
were aggrieved that by having the
Harris Center party cut short they
were being punished for a Joint Board action over which tltey had no direct
control. Although, as one African American student said, “there was
nothing to celebrate." the result of the early closing was simply to leave
a lot of angry people standing around fuming over what happened.

The problem is one of communication. 0n the one hand, CBS have
mishandled the situation. a problem compounded by the impression left
by some CBS members that SGA did notoffer to fund the CBS party. On
the other. many do not understand how black,gay and lesbian, and Jewish
students feel hurt by what to them is quitedisrespectful. Nor do they know
why the resolution was seen asoffensive. One should not forget that even
something created merely in jest has the potential to offend.

The Scarlet and Black believes that SGA was right to defuse the
situation by withdrawing official endorsement and funding from Disco
Week. But one should also commend Joint Board for rejecting a motion
that would have banned tlte week altogether, This would have been a
serious restriction on freedom ofexpression, foronecannot ban something
simply because it is offensive.

Nor can one stop Disco Week simply because itclashes with the timing
of Black History Month. February is. afterall,Americanl-leart Month, and
a great many other things too. Collective celebration of one thing to the
exclusion of everything else is hardly appropriate.

A failure of planning

The Harris Center, a kitsch contrusion of glass, brick and neon, has
ﬁnally landedon North Campus. To be sure, it hasits ﬁner points, buteven
some or these are canceled out by llaws which suggest at least a lack ol

foresight Moreover, it seems to

have been designed for purposes
very different than those for which
Editorial

it is supposedly intended.

Take the cinema. From a design
point of view, it is the best pan of
the building, far. far better than the old ARI-l Auditorium. But it has been
hurt by the erroneous choice of 16mm projectors whose images are quite
lost in the acreage of the 35mm screen. One hopes that having had
sufﬁcient cash to spend well over $3 million on the building, the college
can find a few thousand extra to get the right projectors for the screen.

And if the college claims that it cannot afford the relatively small
amount to put this error right, then how does it explain the decision to
install a diagonal grid of eighteen ﬂashing glassbricks in the north outside
wall of the cinema? Whoever called up the SGA office to report a UFO
sighting deserves congratulation.

The rest of the building is in danger of becoming an architectural trail
of woe. The entrance hall will have to have some furniture put into it if it
is not to seem uttcrly unwelcoming. Seeing people there on Friday and
Saturday nights was like watching teenagers in a shopping mall.

But the most unfortunate misuse ct space in the building occurs in the
concert hall. It seems to a very good facility for concens, but for a party,
one might as well be in a high school gym. The neon in particular is a
shock, the blue being enough to drive people out of the building. The
decision to permamently close Gardner is to be lamented.

CBS issues formal statement on
SGA resolution, weekend's events

To the editor,

This is a letter clarifies the
action taken by Concerned Black
Studenlsin protestofSGA‘spassing
of the Disco Week proposal. Our
methodofresponseonFl-iday night,
February l, 1991 was appropriate
and necessary. Stopping the party
was not intended as a punishment.
The large audience at the party
presented an opportunity for us to
share our concerns. We were
looking forwardtothcparty.butwe
felt that the issue at hand took
precedent over celebration.
Furlhcnnore, N0 SGA FUNDING
was used, the beverages were
courtesy of the Harris Center, and
we had no connection with the
cancellation of the 10 Guys party.

The resolution does more than
declare February 17-February 23
Disco Week. It mocks various
cultulal celebrations, such as Gay/
Lesbian Pride Week and Jewish

CulturalWeek.DuringDiscchek.
Monday is Disco Support Day,
which makes fun of the ribbon
distributions for such important
eventsasNationalComingOutDay.
Tuesday,dcclaredtheday of “Non-
Silence,”mockssacredsilentvigils,
and other similar events, such as
thesilenceobservedbysexualabuse
survivors The tone of the entire
resolution is disrespectful and
makes brutal fun of events and
issues that many people take very
seriously. This is illustrated in the
following statement: “Where as
evenifyoudon‘tpassdiisresolution
wewillholdalithefollowingevents
anyway," Therefore, Disco Week
is an inappropriate event to receive
SGA approval, particularly during
BHLM.

Our goal was not to publicly
label thecreators. nor thcsupportets
of the Disco Week Resolution, as
racist. The present evidence is not
sufficient for that statement.

Student supports CBS

To the editor,

As a member of the European
American population of Grinnelld
would like to take this opportunity
to voice my opinion in support of
the actions of Concerned Black
Students regarding SGA'a approval
of Disco Week.

I have heard many other
European American students
complaining about the termination
of the Harris Center party on
Fehmary l and the reasons for it. I
have heard people saying lhat Disco
Week is only meant in fun and
therefore CBS has no cause to take
offense,thatCBS isonly“whining,"
that stopping the party was childish
and unnecessary, and that taking
one week out of African American
History Month is no big deal.

Ido notbelieve thatoneperson
can tell another what should or
should not bc offensive. Especially
when that person is a European

American who has never
experienced racism and the
discrimination it brings;
discrimination which can be both

whites were declaring dominion

ln actuality,Africankingdomswere
just as powerful and just as rich as
those of medieval Europe, if
medieval European kingdoms can
be called civilized. These early
claims led to the slave trade and the
installment of the “peculiar
institution” irl theUniledStates. No
one can deny the horror of slavery,
nor should anyone deny the lasting
beliefs slavery brought about. What
is it that gives the white race the
idea that they aresomehow superior
to people oi color? I think it is
outrageous to say that CBS is
“whining" because they are

Nonetheless, we do realize that
thoughts and actions such as these
can foster racism, and something
must be done to combat it. We do,
however. seek to pointout the fact
that the creators and supporters are
highly insensitive to racial issues.

We are painfully aware that
racism still exists today. and we
must fight it! However, February
should be a time for us to be at
peace, to celebrate the goodness of
our people, and to remember our
ancestors. Let us have peace during
the shonesl month of the year. We
have edited this letter as much as
possible without losing our intent.

offended by something which has
root in such along history,

The fact that Disco Week is
only meantin fun is exactly what is
offensive about its disruption of
African American History month.
American History classes
everywhere are based upon the
experiences of European settlers,
blatantly ignoring the fact that
twenty of the first settlers in the
colonies were Black. Humanity has
its very roots in Africa, the oldest
remains of ancient CrorMagnons
have been found there. Everyone
learns about Frederick Douglass.
Harriet Tubman, and Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. in elementary

teaching. These are three very
important people of African
American history. But how many
