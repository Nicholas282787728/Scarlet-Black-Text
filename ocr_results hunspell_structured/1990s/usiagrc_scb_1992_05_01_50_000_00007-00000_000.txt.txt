JACKSON: "P

Bill Clinton or Jerry Brown," said
Cobble.

In response to those who argue
that Jackson is not qualified for the
position because he has never held an
elected political office, Cobble said,
“We draw the bounds of leadership
too narrow in this Country." “Jackson
has been politically active,just not in
the arena that they describe as 'poli-
tics,m said Cobble. He referred to
other nations led by nonrpoliticians
includingPoland,ledbyunion-lcader
Lech Walesa, and Czechosloavkia
headed by playwright Vaclav Havel.

son for the Vice Presrdentlal ballot
makes good political sense as well,
Cobble envisions a three-way Presir
dential race between Bush, Clinton
and Perot in which a majority of votes
is no longer required to win the elec-
tion. ll' Clinton on his own could
guarantee 35 percent of the vote,
Cobble said, adding Jesse Jackson to
the Licketcould bring in enough addi-
tional votes to give the Democrats the
three to five percent margin neces
sary to win the election.

“Jackson covers Clinton’s left
ﬂank, including union members and
theprogressivewing.. .Hewould give
liberals areason to vote for the ticket,”
Cobble said.

Addressing thequestion of whether
or not Clinton might lose the Jewish
vote and the state of New York if he
chooses Jackson as a running mate,
Cobble gave two responses. Certain
people have “political reasons to keep
this controversy going,”hesaid. Jesse
Jackson apologized publicly for re—
ferring to New York City as “hymie
town" eight years ago, said Cobble,
who believes there can be “some
reconciliation...some truces de-
clared" between the blackand Jewish
communities in the United States.

“Speaking as a white Protestant,
this is killing us. You can’t build a
socialchangemovementin thiscoun-
trywithoutblacksandyoucan'lbuild
it without the Jewish community,"
said Cobble.

eies on loan guarantees tolsrael, some
mightchoosePerot,and others would
abstain from voting, said Cobble. He
does not think that a four-way split of
the Jewish vote would lose the elec-
tion for the Democrats.

“Forty percent is enough to win
the election," said Cobble, asserting
that a Clinton/Jackson ticket is the
key to a Democratic victory in No-
vember.

Howsuccessful has Lhedraftmove-
mentbcen thus far? Cobble estimated
that one-hundred people are actively
working on the campaign in all fifty
states. Hundreds of people holding
draftJesseJackson for Vice President
signs and wearing the draft
campaign’sbullons attended theCati-
fornia state Democratic COnVeﬂllOns
and attained air coverage on C-Span.
Cobble's efforts have been written up
in Campaign Hotline and the Twin
Cities City Pages. He has also been
contacted by die Baltimore Sun, Na-
tional Public Radio in Cedar Falls
and KPFA in San Francisco.

“l wouldbcsurprised if something
doesn‘t happen at the lowa state con-
vention," said Cobble, “...I think
Jackson is pretty popular in Iowa.”

Cobble said he looks at Jackson’s
chances of being drafted for the Vice
Presidential ticket realistically. "The
power-brokers do not wantJackson,“
he said. But Cobble believes Jesse
Jackson has enormous grassroots sup-
port, pointing out that Jackson won
seven million votcsin the 1988 Demo-
cratic primaries, more than any other
runner-up in the party’s history.

“This guy has an immensearnount
of support in the parly...there's no
reason not to pick him," he said.

Cobble believes the efforts of those
working on the draft Jesse Jackson
campaign are imperative.

“I'm notjust doing this because I
think it‘s morally right; I’m doing it
inpart because itmaybc the only way
to get George Bush out of the White
House," said Cobble.

“I'd also love to watch the Vice
Presidential debate next October be-
tween Quayle andJackson,“ he added,
smiling.

that an open approach to dealing widr
the ramifications of pregnancy is the
most viable.

Before calling in her next patient,
Bailey smiled, cxcusing herself as
“no expert” on either abortion or
pregnancy (although she is a mother),
but vocalized her great willingness to
speak with any pregnant woman eonv

The Health Care Center tries to
handle each person as an individual.
In addition, Bailey was steadfast in
her conviction that the entire stall of

as health care workers, they cannot

FORD: Berg says
"Love the stranger"

continued from page 5

The reason Rabbi Berg intrigues
me so much is that he is so different
from the daily experience here atGrinr
hell, and as the semester wears on
towards an excruciating conclusion I
find that difference tobe all the more
refreshing.Heis,inthefrnalanalysis,
a person who still truly believes in
something. True, the world disapa
points him, his government disap-
points him, he goes through the angst
of wondering what the Secretary of
State Jim “F—rk the Jews" Baker is
thinking today, but he still isn‘tcom-
pletelycynical.Whetherheisrightor
wrong I don’t know, but in his

rhythms, his cadences as he reads the
Talmud, you get the feeling thathe is
experiencing something wonderful.
Something that even if you don’t be-
lieve in it, you have to admire for the
depth of drinking and feeling it pro»
vides.

For Rabbi Berg the answers are
simplephraseswithcomplex reasons.
“Love the stranger," is not a simple
prescription forleadingajust life, it is
also a complex critique of why we
don'tand won‘LThestrangeris some
times a Dahmer or a Manson, some»
times it is a demon or a dybbuk,
sometimes the stranger is our lover,
and sometimes the stranger is no one
other than ourself.

WASHBURN: Duke
still has resolve

is legitimized by Marxism, But
Duke’s supporters, putting aside a
few crazies, haven't been drawn to
his racism, They've been men and
women with valid concems—about
crime, about unfair set-asides, about
state encroachment on their rightsi
which the left has all but excluded
from public discussion.

Pat Buchanan deserves thanks for
plucking this leech from the body
politic. What remains is to move the
important issues into mainstream do»
hate. so that fringe lunatics like Duke

won‘t be able to claim to be among
the few people addressing them, His
craziness aside, Duke has been cor
rect in making that claim.

Buchananhaseffectivelydefwted
him, but has this altered his views or
his resolve? As Zatarain puts it, “He
has been threatened, insulted.
punched, spat upon, clubbed, jailed.
shunned, deported, and ceaselessly
ridiculed, but still he maintains his
convictions.“ Duke himself told
Zatarain, “I knew from an early age
that the struggle would belong and
difficult."
