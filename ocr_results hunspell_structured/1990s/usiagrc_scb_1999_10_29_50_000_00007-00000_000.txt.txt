' TAs, PAs picket labor negotiations at UW-Madison

By Beth A. Williams
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. --

Over 200 UW-Madison teaching and
project assistants turned out Wednesday to sup.
port their union, the Teaching Assistants' As»
sociation, as contract talks with the university
continued.

The TAs and PA: gathered outside of the
Memorial Union for a rally before going inc
side the Union and lining the sides of the
fourth-ﬂoor corridor and srairways that both
negotiating teams needed to pass by in order
to get to the meeting room.

“were here to heat up bargaining," TAA
co-Prcsidcnt Martha Mock said, "We‘re here
to make them uncomfortable “

TAA spokesperson Eric iarosinski said TM
members are upset over a proposed restructur»
ing which would remove the pay raiseTAsand
PA: receive when they become dissertatots.

"The university wants to restructure the
way that TAs and Ms are paid,“ Jatosinski said.
"What that bureaucratcsc means is that new
TA: and PA: will be given a small raise but
that raise Will be paid for by a pay cut for the
most-experienced TA; and PAS,"

Vice Chancellor John Totphy said no cur»
rent TA or PA will receive a pay cut.

"The university proposal does not reduce
anybody‘s salary currently," Totphy said.

According toTorphy, the university has said
that a separate pay scale ior dissertators did not
exist until the‘l'AA received tuition remission,

He said uw believes experience should play a
factor in higher pay, not just whether a person
is a dissertator.

"The differential should be based on cpr
rience as it was in the past." he said. "Some-
how the new process has to take into account
experience."

Jatosinski said the TM is requesting a 5.25
percent pay increase as well as a closing orthe
gap between what TAs and ms are paid.

"My salarywent down $217 a month when
lwenr from one department to another, from
TA to m, to get more experience and become
more marketable," Educational Administration
PA Madeline Hafncr said. “What I do is very
different but no more or less important at this
university".

The TAA is also asking for domestic part-
ner benefits and for the university to increase
its contribution to the child care Tuition As-
sistance Program.

French TA Aaron Jossatt brought his s-and-
aehalﬁmontheold son, Jonah to the protest.
Jossart said he was there to support his union
and show that real people are being affected
by these negotiations.

"I‘m a tamer or one right now and it‘s so
hard to make it on this salarys" Jossatt said.

Jossart said he works three jobs in order to
make ends meet. .

"it's just sad to see such a good university
with such high standing treat their employees
with such little respect," he said.

TAA volunteer organizer Kevin Wehr said
theTAA needed to stage a protest in order to
get the university to listen to urem.

"Ifwe are not out here screaming and yell—
ing, historically, diey don‘t give us anything,"
Wehr said.

Wehr said the TAA is planning a series of
escalating actions through our November.

Jarosinslci said the TAA began bargaining
with UW in March. Their two-year contract
expired in June and they are currendy work-
ing under a contract extension. he said.

Totphy said the uw money tor the cone
tract has already been set by the state. In die
ﬁrst year ofthe contract there is a 2 percent

increase and 2.5 percent in the second year.
