Students weren't impressed, but
Iowa senator Tom Harkin carried
Grinnell on his way to a sweeping
statc-wide Victory in lowa's first-in-
the»nation caucuses Monday night.
His mandate was weakened by apoor
turnout. State Democratic organtcers

licans, having keptcolumnistPaLrick

leader David Duke off the ballot. did
not select presidential candidates.

A majority of the few students
whoattended the ﬁrstpreeinctcaucus
favored former Massachusetts sena-
tor Paul Tsongas, but townspeople
voted heavily for Harkin, who gained
15 of 28 precinct delegates to the
county convention. Only a handful
joined students in electing 8 Tsongas
delegates. Arkansas governor Bill

Tsongas’s moderate politics and

four years ago, Arizona governor
Bruce Babbit. found favor with
Grinnclltans, “He‘s the only person
with any policies that I can stomach
in the cnure party, Harkin being my
main enemy. I very strongly dislike
the man. because of srmplistic eco-
nomic policies that border on racist
anti-Japanese and anti-Mexican sen»
timents,“ said Bob Mahon.

Tsongas also attracted conserva-
tives. John Brentnall rercgisteredas a
Democrat to support him in the cau-
cus. “I support Tsongas. I am a Re»
publican,aregistered Republican, but
I truly believe Paul Tsongas is the
best candidate.” he said "He’s the
only one I believe has a full. pro-

business economic policy.“

"Hejustappears to me to be a little
tnore genuine about trying to reduce
the deficit. Less rhetoric comes from
him than any other candidate," added
Brentnall.

Students from northeastern states
noted Tsongas‘s past performance in
House and Senate politics as a major
advantage. Holly Collins, who is
from Massachusetts. said “He had a
very good record in Massachusetts,
and when hcdecided notto run {one-
election it was really a sad thing. He
was hailed as one of the best new»
comers to the Senate and it was a
shame he had to leave."

Thehalf dozen students who voted
for Harkin did so on the grounds of
civil rights and women's issues. “I‘m
voting for Harkin because he's the
most liberal candidate on abortion
rights. I can’t see him running the
country, because I think he’s a ’good

Swastikas reappear in Dibble

By Chris Maag

The new year has not graced
Grinnell with the absence of hate
crimes. Four swastikas have so far
been found on the walls in Dibble
Hall. There were two swastikas drawn
on the door of a Jewish student in the
hall, and two more have been drawn
in black crayon on papers hanging in
stairwells.

Thefirstcameattheendofthefirst
week of this semester, and the most
recent was a pair that were drawn on
an open letter from the residents of
the hall which rejected the swastikas
and warned the person responsible
for them that he or she would be
prosecuted. The letter was signed by
a majority of Dibble’s residents, and
was originally intended to have been
printed in its entirety in the Scarlel
and Black.

“We decided that it is a serious
enough thing that itreally needs to be
addressed every time ithappens." said
third-ﬂoor Student Advisor Alex
Sevems. “I think this is better than
thinking thatif youignore it and don’t

give the person the attention they
want. they'll eventually stop.”

Residents decided against print—
ingtheletter,believingthatthis might
catch the attention of Des Moines
television reporters who unexpect-
edly came into the dorm last semester
to report on the swastikas. The letter
has now been made available so that
Dibble residents can go to their SAs
for a copy to hang outside their doors
or in the hallways.

”It‘s very frustrating and I know
it's frustrating for the students.“ said
Dibble and Clark Resident Advisor
Janice Gerda.“lwishlcoulddo more.
I wish that there was something more
that I could offer. But honestly, even
though I‘m just a few feet away.
there’s really little I can do to help
look out for this person.” Currently,
she says, the only thing that can be
done on campus is for the residents of
and visitors to Dibble to watch for a
person actually drawing swastikas in
the hall.

The Grinnell Police, too, are de»
pending mostly on student help in
looking for the person involved. They

*IN THIS ISSUE

have collected all the peices of paper
on which the swastikas were origi-
nally written, but say that these can-
notdo much in helping to identify the
person.

“Fingerprints aren’t really helpful
because there are so many on the
papers. We are, however, trying a few
new approaches to investigating these
crimes,”said Sergeant Randy Hansen,
Grinnell Police’s Chief Investigator,
who participated in a recent statewide
conference of law-enforcement offi»
cials on how to build better cases
against hate crimes suspects Hansen
declined to say what new techniques
were being used in drying to identify
the suspect.

“We really want to show every-
body we have unity and that this is a
community, because it seemslike this
is an attack mostly on Dibble," said
Sevems.

The hate crimes law has been in
effect in Iowa for almost a year. Sus-
pects found guilty of hate crimes like
the ones at Grinnell face a misde-
meanor charge, with a maximum of
thirty days in jail and/or a $100 ﬁne.

College students submit their caucus votes at Grinnell High

School on Monda .

Smith becomes first
smoke-free dormitory

By Chris Maag

Grinnell will introduce its first
smoke-free residence hall next year.
SGA, with the advise of the Housing
Committee, has voted to ban smok-
ing in Smith Hall and Smith Annex
for the 199293 school year.

“I'm thinking in terms ofnew stu»
dents. if you’ve got a student who's
gota problem thatrcquires him or her
to live in a smoke-free atmosphere. it
might not affect students on campus
too much. but it might have a strong
impact on someone just coming in,"
said Oda Callison, Dean of Student
Housing.

Smith was chosen because it
is mediumasized, and has
accomodations for co-ed, single-sex
male,and single»sex femaleliving. It
was also chosen because of its close-
ness to both the north and south sides
of campus, as opposed to its almost
identical counterpart Dibble.

Phill Schubuck. Associate Direc»
tor for Mechanical and Structure Sys~
terns, also pointed out that because
Smith is at the end of a line of resi-
dence halls, smoke from two neigh
boring halls won'tconstantly beblow-
ing in from both sides through win-
dows and air ventilation systems.

The motion to make Smith a

smoke-free dorm was originally go»
ing to be tabled by Joint Board for a
week to get to let senators receive
further student feedback and give
them time to think about the pro-
posal.

Some senators also suggested the
possibility of making Langansmoke-
free because of its north/south
seperation. Schubak disagreed with
this idea. however. saying that smoke
from one side of the partition could
easily seep into the other through the
middle wall. Callison also disagreed
with this, saying that such an action
would force the housing committee
to go back to the drawing board, push»
ing the Housing Committee against
the deadline of Spring Break and
Room Draw and give them little time
to come up with a new recommenda»
tion.

“It seems to me that what I hear
here all the time is that everybody
wantsasmoke-froeresidencehallbut
they don’t like the choice of Smith,”
said Callison. “I hear Dibble men-
tioned a lot. but I think if you reject
Smith, we‘ll have to start all over
again, and you still might not like
what we come up with.”

The vote in favor of Smith was 21
for. zero against, and one senator ab»
stained.
