that form within a faintly Ms.

otherplays for the Gi'iltltcll Cotnmu.
nity Theater, said “It [The Cocktail

that is being discussed lit the play."

Mr, Mitchell said, “The play ace
lually centers around the relationship
betwccn a father and his second far
voiitc son, The play which 1 [John]
have written brings the skeletons
from the closet and stirs up emotion
In the normally store“ family."

The play is note normal comedy
because it achieves its comedic ef-
fect in an atypical routine. Ms.
Vocl'tman said, "It is not like a Neil
Simon play with a lot of witty gag
lines. but rather a comedy of charac-
ter. They are a little off the track, but
real and believable.”

According to Ms. Voertman, the
staging forthe play will be tn “three—
quarter round." The set has only one
wall, and the audience will be seated

on three sides. Ms. Voertman said,
“I have enjoyed working in the inti-
mate space we are using. It is just
right for this kind of play. The audir
ence will feel that it is eavesdropping
on a real family,just outside its three
invisible walls."

The cast began rehearsing the play
in the beginning of September, Both
the director and the performers have
enjoyed working on this production.
Ms. Kamp said, ”I have had a great
time practicing and have learned a
lot about theater and acting." Direc»
tor Voertman said, “I have also enr
joyed these four people enormously.
Because of real life commitments.
we have conﬁned our rehearsals to
four a week, many of which had to

start at 9:00 p.m. because of profes-
sional conﬂicts. Everyone has shown
great ﬂexibility and higlt good hu-
met."

The director and cast have put a
lot of time and work into their pro
duction of The Cocktail Hour. This
time and work should pay off in the
form of several rewarding perforv
mances. ‘

The audience seating for each per-
formance is limited to 88 people.
Tickets for The Cock/(til Hour may
be purchased for $8.00 apiece at
Bikes to You and Brown’s Shoe Fit.
Ms. Veertinan is looking forward to
a full house on opening night, so tickr
ets should be purchased soon to guarr
antee seating.

Student-produced
‘Love Letters’ opens-tonight

Minimalist play documents friendship

By KATE KLEINWORTH
Staff Writer

Grinnell College Theatre will be
presenting the play Love Lei/er: by
A R. Gurney this Friday and Sate
urday night at a pm In Hallie
Flanagan Arena Theatre, Tickets
are free of charge and available at
the door before eaclt performance,
Scaling is limited.

Love Letters is the story of the
friendship oftwo people, Andy and
Melissa, who communicate with
each other entirely through letters,
from childhood to the death of Me—
lissa. The play consists of the char—
acters, played by Steve Watkins
‘98 and Allison Groves ‘00, read,
ing aloud from their letters to each
otherr

This play is an “open space"
production, meaning it is entirely
student run. Ali Borger ‘99, the di-
rector, submitted an extensive ap-
plication. and was granted a bud»
get, staff advisers and use of the
theatre, She selected the play her-
self, and with sophomore Barbara
31055, the stage manager, held so»
ditions and chose the cast and
crew,

Berger first read Love Letter: in
high school, and fell in love with
it. She believed the “open space"
production would be perfect for
this play.

“I wanted to do [Love Letters]
here because it needs a Black Box
theater, and we have that here,"
Borger said. “Also, it demands that
the audience think, which is good
for a college environment."

Because there is so little action,

this can be a difficult play to stage,

“It's challenging in that it’s
pretty minimalistic,” Berger said.
"I’m a little nervous. You have to
keep the audience's attention on
what the actors are saying, not due
ing, the whole time."

To show that the characters are
in different places, the lighting for
the production is elaborate, Senior
Ryan Brummel handles the light
ing and design, and created “a re
ally exciting concept of how to
make the characters be in differ
ent worlds," according to Berger.

Love Letters has a small cast and
crew, and has not been in rehearsal
very long. Because the actors are
reading letters, no lines have to be
memorized. It has been only three
weeks from auditions I0 perfor-
mance. The author suggests an
even shorter time.

For Berger, this is her first ex-
perience directing at Grinnell. She
was involved in several produc-
tions in high school. including
writing and directing a play of her
own, She has enjoyed directing
this play because of the indepenee
of an entirely student~run produce
tion.

“I love it. There is lot of free—
dom for us to work," Berger said.
“I don’t think that’s missing when
there is an adult advising, but there
is more of a rapport between me
as the director and the other stu~
dents. I like being able to pursue
my own vision. Before I always
had an advisor who had their own
vision and had to compromise.
Now I can run full force with what
I want."
