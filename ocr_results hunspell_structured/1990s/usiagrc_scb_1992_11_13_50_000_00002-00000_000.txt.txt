have and the struggles we still have to
go." said Kay Wilson Jenkins, dimer

duced Diane Finnerty‘s talk about
Emma Goldman Wednesday after
noon in Burling Basement.

Diane Finnerty, Gail Sand, and
Angie Kennedy came from the Emma
Goldman Clinic, in Iowa City, to in-

In the early '705 several young
women decided to start a women's
clinic in IowaCity. They thought long
and hardahoutwho to name tlicclinic
after and settled on Goldman because
J. Edgar Hoover called her, “Lhe most
dangerous woman in America.“

Emma Goldman was a Russian
bomJewish Anarchistwho rallied for
women‘s equality, women’s repro—
ductive righis, for free speech, and
other issues of liberty and freedom.
She is known for her unquenchbale
voice and she urged all women to
speak with such force. She said,
“Women must not always have their

wombs open and their mouths
closed." Finnerty speculated that the
reason Goldmanwas considered, ‘thc
most dangerous woman in America
was because, “she would talk about
anything.”
So,Finnertyexplainedmegroup

been involved in the anti-war move-
ment, named their clinic after dii'

workers at the clinic believe that the
bast wtiy for women to care for their
health is for them to educated about
their own bodies and needs. The sec-
and princtplt; is the right to abortion,
and the clinic is one oftlie few places
in Iowa which offers abortions,
Finnerty stressed that the phir
losophy of medical care Wthl‘l is
offered altheEmmttGoldinan Clinic
is one which values the woman's
needs and self conception as well as
her physical hcttlth. All of the direc-
tors of Lhc center also give hands on
care, so they all know what they
women they serve need.
Finnertyand Sandconcurred that
the women who started the center
thought that it would be temporary,
that the national health care system

and other forces would take up the
cause and the center would no longer
be needed. They thought after u few
years they would be able to return to
Law School or their other studies.
However, the centerwill be celebrat»
ing its twentieth anniversary in Scpr
tembcr.

when she was proclaiming the needs
for equality and free speech, humane
work environments, and free love.
“Now," Xl|lll the women from the
Clinic, we know that revolution is
everyday."

Both Sand and Finnerty dis-
cussed the various difficulties the
clinic has faced over the years. In its
early days it was worried by money
troubles, the women found it very
difficult to obtain a loan for a small
business owned and operated by
women.
