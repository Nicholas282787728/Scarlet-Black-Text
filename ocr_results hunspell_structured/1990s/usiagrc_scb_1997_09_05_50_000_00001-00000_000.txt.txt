Billions mourn Princess Diana’s death

LOS ANGELES - From Taiwan to Tel AVlv, the World
is mourning the death of Princess Diana with a global
shock and outpouring of griefrlot seen since U.S. Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy‘s 1963 assassination.

While experts debate why a young woman with slene
der formal political credentials is prompting such a dis.
play of raw emotion, billions of people are unabashe
edly weeping for the “people‘s princess."

More than 2.5 billion people around the world are ex
pected to watch her funeral on television Saturday 7
many millions more than saw her fairy-tale wedding,
The ceremony will include a performance by one of
the late princess‘ closest friends, Elton John.

While thousands of Britons waited long hours for a
chance to sign a condolence book, the royal family 7
including Diana’s former husband Prince Charles and
their two sons William and Harry — have stayed in
Scotland, far from where her body lies in London and
far from their nation‘s emotional upheaval.

Vice ProaidentA] Gore implicated in campaign
funding fraud

WASHINGTON — Two Buddhist nuns told a Senate
committee Thursday they destroyed and altered docue
ments relating to Vice President Al Gore's visit to their
temple, which raised $100,000 in apparently illegal do~
nations, ‘
Testifying before the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, Man Ho and Yi Chu of the Hsi Lai Temple
in Hacienda Heights, California, admitted destroying
a list ofconlributors and the amounts they donated and
otherdocuments and altering checks to spare the temple
embarrassment.

The hearing represented a clear political danger for
Gore’s presidential hopes, especially coming aday af.
ter the Justice Department opened a 30eday review into
his fund-raising activities from the White House. That
process could lead to the appointment of an indepen-
dent counsel.

In Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, vacationing
President Clinton said he believed Gore had done noth-
ing wrong.

“I believe what he did was legal and the Justice De-
partment has to make its own delenninatlon. which I
am conﬁdent they will do based on the law," Clinton
said.

House Republicans, however, renewed their demand
for an independent investigator.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
an Illinois Republican, said: “When you take these
allegations individually, they are lnost troubling.
However, cumulatively they are overwhelming."

Smoky, sour, sexy, mSinuatjng

renowned soprano to perform at Herrick

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Editor-In-Chelf

World-renowned soprano Jill Gomez
will bring her unique theatrical style to
Grinnell when she performs here in a Pub—
lic Events Concert on Friday, September
12 at 8pm in Herrick Chapel,

Gomez, anative ofTrinidad, will sing
“The Spanish Songbook: A Celebration
ofSpain in Song," which includes pieces
by Vasquez, de Fuellana, Granados,
Turina, Schumann, Bizet, and Ravel. She
will be accompanied by pianist Julius
Drake, who performed at Grinnell last
semester with baritone Wolfgang
Holzmair,

Jill Gomez has built an illustrious
career on luck and determination. She got
her first start in performance playing
Peasehlossom in a staging ofA Midsumr
merNight’r Dream in which her sister and
mother also participated. At the urging
of a grammar school mistress, Gomez
began singing compeli lively. She has not
looked back since.

Gomez’s career in opera began when
she was spotted in the audience of, ironie
cally, 2 Benjamin Britten version ofA
MidsummerNight’s Dream at the Covent
Garden Opera in London. After an audie
tion for which she was jokingly rated
“...one out often for ability, and nine out
often for cheek" by opera director Janl
Strasser, she was invited to join Britain’s
prestigious Glyndebourne opera com~
pany.

Having since sung with companies
and conductors in Zurich, Paris, Turin, Tel

a thriving recording career, Gomez has
earned worldwide recognition and re-

2001: A Space Odyssey

Large incoming class inspires worries about

crowding as lounges become room.

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
News Cerditor

A recordebreaking number of first
years and transfers entered Grinnell's Stu»
,dent populatlon this fall amid rumors of
chaos in the admissions and housing der
partmenls.

There are 451 new students enrolled
this year. “That’s a large class," said Di—
rector of Admissions Vince Cuseo, “but
it was intended to be large because oflzlst
year's large senior class."

About thirty more students chose Grin—
nell than admissions predicted. “The
good news,” Cuseo said, “is that we had
a three percent increase in students who
are accepting Grinnell‘s offer of admis-
sion."

This year's applicant pool was 37%
larger than last years, with 2900 students
applying. Cusco ascribed the increase in
applications to “greater media attention,
well advertised financial strength, and
well satisﬁed students."

Cuseo attributed the higher than exe
peeled yield for the class of 2001 to the
satisfaction with the Grinnell experience
that upperclassmen communicated to pro-
spective students, as exempliﬁed by in-
creased participation in Volunteers In Stu-
dent Admission (VISA). Faculty recruit-
ment of particularly gifted students and
an increase in alumni interviews also
played a role, he said.

Many students, both upperclassmen
and first years, are concerned about the
effects of the large incoming class. “I
think it puts us at a disadvantage because
we have stressed resources, but it also
gives us a challenge, because we have to
figure out how to use the resources bet-
ter," snid Kati Toan ‘01. Alex Racho ‘00
said “It's a little overwhelming The fact
that they had to take lounges and turn
them into rooms. , . I was amazed by that."

”Expansion allows a lot of space for
carbon copies of molnstream Amerlcan
culture to come in, and that shouldn’t be,"

Joe Chifztri ‘01 said, expressmg the fear
of some students that the larger class will
change the atmosphere on campus. “It
kind of represents how the college is try
ing to get bigger and more well known.
For us it‘s cool. because we want people
to know what Grinnell is, but it sucks for
upperclassmen, who want it to stay the
same," said ﬁrst year Sarah Jackson.

Some students also fear that the cam-
pus is lowering its standards, ”It‘s a re»
ally fricking big class." said sophomore
Cathy Bell. “Who am I to say it's too big?
Who am I to say that they aren’t all ge-
niuses? Who am I to say that standards
are going down? But it could be." Jack-
son seconded this sentiment, “I thought I
was special, then I found out they let a lot
of people in."

Despite these fears, Grinnell was more
selective in choosing this year’s incom-
ing class. Due to the increased applicant
pool only around 5_0% of students who
applied to Grinnell were accepted, Cusco
said. This is down more than ten percent
from previous years.

Another major concern that students
and the admlssions office share is the dis
lrlbutlon of incoming minority students
According to Concerned Black Students
(CBS) member Jamal Rogers ‘00, the new
class “really has an affect on the black
population. We just graduated a really big
class last year, and this yearthere are only
seven new black students " Rogers estir
mated that around 20 African Americans
graduated last year.

“The number of admitted African
American students was roughly the same
this year," said Cuseo, “but the yield went
down. .. We're not pleased about that,"
Cuseo said that this is “something that wt:
hope to remedy next year."

There are three new Native American
and 18 new ASlan American students ,
roughly the same as in years past. The
Latino/a population remalns the fastest
growing multicultural group on campus,
with 22 new students this year.

This situation was exacerbated by the
fact that Gomez was never given a chance
to recover from herillncss. “As a result,”
Gomez said in an interview with Carib-
bean People magazine, “I got more and
more anxious about a particular high note
which I had previously managed with
ease. I almost had a physical breakdOWn.
l began to think I'd never sing again."

Fortunately, with the support ofa new
voice coach, Gomez got over the incident
and slowly rebuilt her conﬁdence.

Today, she is perhaps best known for
her larger-than—life persona. She has
never shied away from daring, bold roles,
such as her performance as Cleopatra in
Handel’s Giulia Cesare. On that occa—
sion, Ms. Gomez sang with two boa con-
strictor: on stage, She was told that the
snakes had been fed and thus would be
sleeping peacefully, but when it came
time for their appearance, the boas were
wtde awake, darting at Gomez as she
sang. The soprano continued straight
through the snakes‘ performance and the
opera came offwithout a hitch, while the
audience never suspected that anything
was out of the ordinary.

Jill Gomez‘s singing style has been
described in vivid terms by critics world-
wide. The HieFi News called her voice
on her recordings of cabaret music as
“smoky, sour, sexy, insinuating." The
London Times commented that she
“holds the audience in her spell with fa-
cial expression or bodily stance.“

Professor Michael Cavanagh, a fan
who was instrumental in bringing Gomez
to the Grinnell campus, said, “She’s an
exciting, vivacious perfonner...For some
people “soprano“ connotes someone who
stands up straight and stiff and sings like
an angel. Jill‘s voice isn’t like that, It
comes from earth, not heaven. And it's
enormously beautiful."

Iill Gomez‘s free performance will
present Grinnellians with an exceptional
opportunity to experience talent the likes
of which is rarely seen in such intimate
surroundings,
