third in Gleysteen Relays

By Dave Ressner

The Grinnell College women‘s
swim team butted heads with Wash—
ington University (St. Louis) and two
NCAA Division II Learns in recent
competition. Mad Duck lost to Wash.
U. in head-to-head competition on
Nov. 22 and tied the Bears for third
place the next day in the Gleysteen
Relays.

Wash. U. has a history of making
things tough for Mad Duck. In their
last two meetings, the Bears from St.
Louis beat Grinnell, 147-55 and ISS-
46.Grtnnellmanagedtokeepitcloser
this time, though, but eventually
bowed out 128-93.

Grinnellians won three events the
first night. The 200 Medley Relay

usually a distance specialist, sprinted
to first place in the 100 freestyle; and
Ingrid Swenson racked up 195.25
points to win the one-meter diving

competition.

The following day, two more
teams, Mankato State and Northeast
Missouri State. braved the snowy
weather to attend the Gleysteen Re-
lays. a meet consisting solely of relay
events.

Throughout the day. it became
obvious thatMankato and Nonheast
Missouri were battlin g between them-
selves for ﬁrst and that Grinnell and
Wash. U. would be left to ﬁght for
third. Neither Wash. U. nor Grinnell
placed higher than second in any event
and Mankato and Northeast took 1-2
in all but three events.

The meet ended with Northeast
slipping by Mankato. 120-104, and
the race for third came down to the
ﬁnal event. Wash. U. took fourth in
the 400 free relay and Grinnell came
in right behind at ﬁfth to knot the
score in an appropriate 74-74 tier

17 points and 19 rebounds.

Saturday‘s game against Central
College proved to be a long afternoon
for the Pioneers. Last year, Grinnell
was the team that kept Central out of
theplayoffs,but afterthis year‘s game
Eskilsen noted, “they came out like
sharks smelling blood, and we didn’t
know how to react We were much
too tenative."

Grinnell never got on track, and
Central rolled to an 86-45 victory.
Grinnell could not organize any
consistant play. as only Hancock was
able to reach the double ﬁgure pla-
teau. One of the few bright spots in
the victory was the strong play of Lisa
York who grabbed 12 rebounds for
the team, Eskildsen said.

After the losstoCentral,Eskildsen
said of the team, “We are playing like
a typical team searching for its iden-
tity. We still don’t know exactly who
we are and we‘ve lacked some con-
sistency." The team‘52-2 record does
notbotherEskildsen and he feels con-
ﬁdent that, “we'll get better and bet-
ter as the year goes on, and we’ll be
playing our best at the end of the
year."

Eskildsen hopes Thursday’s game
at Con-tell will help the team ﬁnd its
identity. “We need to become more
consistent and we cannot afford any
ﬂuctuations."
