iIson: "SGA to reach

_ For those of you who don’t ale
ready know me. I am Michael lson. a
‘third year student majoring in chem-
.isuy and Chinese Studies. I am run»
ning for the position of SGA Presi

.President must have the
right goals for the carn-

-and expertise to lead. I am
this candidate.
I My main goal in rune
uning for SGA President is
'toincreasestudentpanici—
pation in decision making
'on campus. In the past.
,SGA has failed to give the
students the results they
Iexpect. which led to stu—
dent apathy. I want to en-
. courage studentdebate on
issues and solicit student
- opinion.
I will get studentinput
on ways to solve campus
‘ problems and hold Open

’solutions. I will not stop
working with the admin-
- istration and/or student groups until a
Isolution is reached that satisfies the
students.
‘ My work as Treasurer has alerted
.me to the excess of red tape inherent
in the SGA system. I plan to address
‘this problem when elected. I would,

for example. encourage standardized
budget approval.

My work as CYCLONE editor»in-

Yes. I did read Shelly West’s edir
toriai in the February 14th Scarlet

her. but on somewhatdifferent terms

Events Committee, and the Finance

Committee for two years. I also

chaired the Drug and Alcohol Heare

ing Board for one year. I worked

closely with the Committee on Stu-
dentLiferegardingthel-IAC
program, and currently
serve on the Hall Council
Committee.

My work with these or
ganizations has put me in
contact with many student
groups on campus. I have
also worked closely with the
President, the Dean of Stu»

especially useful as SGA
President.

Even an active, simpli~

fully achieve the students'
goals withoutstudentinput.

questions you may have about my
campaign.

I am counting on your vote to
make a better SGA for all of us. Vote
MICHAEL ISON for SGA PRESI-
DENT on March 4.

[am a woman. but more imponantly,
I am the one candidate who best ﬁlls
the above description of the ideal
President for 1992-93.

I have been an
active member of
SGA since my
sophomore year
when I acted as
senator for
Younker during
second semester.

It was during this

time that my in-

Lerest in SGA was

sparked, working

both as a repre-

sentative to Joint

Board and as a

member of the

Special Events

C o m m i t t e e .

When appointed

Social Coordinae

tor for this year. I

knew that there

were certain re-

sponsibilities that I would need to
fulfill. butl also seta goal for myself:
to go above and beyond those set
responsibilities.

I have worked extensively with
the Concerts, Films and All-Campus
Events Committees, as the SGA by-
laws specify 1 should, keeping the
calendar and budgets for all three of
these committees. I have also been
recently appointed to the Hall Coun-
cil Committee. which will determine
the composition and function of the
hall councils that will be put into
place next year. But the most impresr
sive project which I have undertaken
on my own accord has been my com-
mitmenttoanidcathatlcame up with
last summer-SpringCamival, Ifyou
have not yet heard much about the
Carnival. it is largely because this is
the first time such an event has been

attempted. Hopefully. it will become
an annual event. incorporating both
the campus and town communities.
raising a good deal of money for the
community service projects on carn-
pus, Activities will include two dozen
game booths. a dunk tank. a
Moonwalk, a haunted house. and a
fortune teller. among many others.
Carnival promises to be an event
which can promote town/gown rela-
tions while at the same time bring
back the spirit of campus unity which

I

was present during the days of the
Grinnell Relays and the Peace Day
festivities.

I won’t attempt to claim full re-
sponsibility for the organization of
the Carnival; 1 have had an active
committee which has helped im-
mensely. But heading up this event
has provided me with invaluable exA
perience. I have learned how to nego-
tiate with the administration. to del-
egate responsibility. to find creative
solutions to obstacles that l have ntn
into, and to thoroughly develop my
organizational skills. All of these are
qualities which are indispensable in
an SGA President, especially one who
plans to venture outside of the
structure‘s role and attempt to make
innovations in campus life.
