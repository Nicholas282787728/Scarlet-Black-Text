furious windstorm hits area

An intense low-pressure system.
coiled at the Iowa-Minnesota border
Tuesday, produced an immense wind-
storm that n'pped shingles from roofs,
toppled high-profile vehicles and tore
down trees and limbs across a broad
area of the central United States.

Although damage was minimal in
Grinnell 7 unlike that resulting from
the monster storms ofthis spring and
summer — the system did produce
winds clocked as high as 68 mph at
Grinnell Regional Airport.

“At one time the wind was clocked
up to 61 knots, which is about 67 or 68
mph," said Don Guinnee, who was
ﬁlling in for Darrell White, the airport
manager. “Most of the trme, we had
sustained winds of around 50 mph,
although it did dip down a few times
itito the 40s and 305."

Barometer tells the story

The tropical-storrn-force windswere
spawned by a deep pressure gradient.
For much of Tuesday, the barometer
hovered only slightly above 29 inches
of mercury here.

Although the day-long storrn ripped
big limbs from some trees in Grinnell,
the damage didn't compare to that
which occurred in October 1997 or
during the savage winds that accompa-
nied supercell thunderstorms earlier
this year. The main reason: most de-
ciduous trees had shed their leaves.

But the winds did rip a rooffrom the
Montezuma Senior Home, damage
some farm outbuildings and, in a spec-
taculardemonstration of theirstrength,
pushasemirtmilerrig all the way across
Iowa Highway 146.

The semi was southbound when the
wind shoved it from the right lane into
the median and acrossboth northbound
lanes. The rig ﬁnally came to a stop on
the shoulder ofthe highway. The acci-
dent happened near the Country Inn
Motel in south Grinnell.

 

 

 

 

What in the world will we do for
excitement now that the elections and
Halloween are over, John Glenn has
come back to earth, the first snow of
the season has come and gone, the
World Series is over and both Grinnell
High School andGrinnell College have
led their football conferences?

Just in time came the big blow!

Whew! Are we all still here aﬁer
that?

We didn‘t even have enough warn»

In a small way, the experiences here
Tuesday in the Midwest may have
given us an appreciation for what

One ofGi-innell’snewcst businesses,
tthountry Inn on Highway 146 South,
felt the shock of the weather Tuesday
as it opened its doors to host a ribbon-
cutting event by the Grinnell Chamber
Ambassadors.

No sooner had guests an'ived than
the power went out and everyone wanr
tiered around in the dark. Not only that
but some oftheir siding blew away in
the gale. Fortunately, they were ableto
convince the crew ofThe Abel Group
to come repair the damage during the

An unusual coincidence was called
to Around‘sattenti on during that event:
ltseemsthatTuesday,Nov. 10, the day

the tragic event on Lake Michigan in
which the ore boat, The Edmund
Fitzgerald, sank inhigh winds, an event
which has become the stuff of fable
and song. The boat had left Duluth,
Minn., on Lake Superior and was en
route to Gary, Ind, when it foundercd
in high winds with a huge loss oflife.

Blizzard to north and West

This part of Iowa, though, was rela-
tively lucky. The storm produced bliz-
zard conditions in South Dakota and
Minnesota, and the Iowa State Patrol
closed a section of Interstate 35 in
northem Iowa.

It was the fiist signiﬁcant snowstorm
of the season for the central U.S., and it
produced nearly a foot of snow at some
locations in the Dakotas and Minne-
sota.

In Wisconsin, atop gust was clocked
at 93 mph.

Alliant Energy, which serves the
Grinnell area and much of eastern Iowa,
issued a news release in which it said
utility crews would continue to work
throughout the night to restore power
lost to the winds. The company said
that several utility poles had sustained
damage.

Winds hit at 4 mm.

The company began receiving re-
ports of scattered outages at 4 am.
Tuesday, which was about the time the
first strong winds beganbuffeting Grin-
nell.

"As crews restore power, additional
'outages are occurring,” a company
spokeswoman said. "Atany giventime,
the company estimates that roughly
3,000 to 5,000 customers are without
power."

Some spotty outages were reported
in the Grinnell area, although none was
prolonged. Hardest hit were communi-
ties in northwest Iowa, although the
company also reported problems in
Marshalltown, Tania and Toledo.

The news of the death of Mike
Fitzgerald, the popular recently retired
principal of Grinnell Middle School,
comes as a shock to the entire commu~
nity. Around had the privilege of serv-
ing with Mike for several years on the
ﬁrst integrated Grinnell Parks and Rece
reation Commission, and what a level-
headed creative member he was, al-
ways with theinterests of young people
at heart.

Around forever will feel that Mike
sacrificed his health for the Grinnell
community in overseeing the develr
opment of the new Grinnell Middle
School of which we all are so proud.

A weak cold front made its way
through the region Thursday, pro-
ducing some light showers in southern
Iowa and some clouds elsewhere.

But high temperatures should be in
the 40s and 50s through the weekend.

The storm produced a total of .77
inches over three days, with the bulk
of the precipitation 7 .73 inch 7
falling Tuesday. It brought the No-
vember total to 1.32 inches so far and
the year-to-date total to 40.77 inch,
which is well above the average for
Grinnell.

I-Iigh temperatures during the pe-
riod since Monday ranged from 38 to
49, while nighttime lows ranged from
30 to 38. Grinnell's mean temperature
for November stood at 37.5 degrees.
The average for the entire month is

#1 Decorah is next for Tigers

When Grinnell and Decorah square
offon Monday,Nov. 16 at 8:45 pm. at
the UNI-Dome, the Tigers maybelook-
ing into a mirror.

Well, not quite. As faras these teams‘
tendencies go, they both preferto run
the ball. However, the Vikings do not
have the same kind of size and speed
the Tigers possess.

Decorah, ranked No. 1 in Class 3-A,
have many outstanding players and
clearly have more talent than anycf the
opponents Grinnell has faced this
season.A

“It looks to me like it is going to be
an even match, a slugfest," said
Decorah Coach Bill Post. “Both teams
do similartypes ofthings. Grinnell has
three very good backs... ansen is solid,
fast and a hard worker. They have a
good fullback,they doalotofcrossing

action in the back field. They have a

nice size offensive and defensive line
and the passing game, they pass ad-
equately, also. But running is their
forte, and that is what we do. We do

similar things, Grinnell runs the wing-
T offense and we do the same thing,
althoughwerunmultlpleoffenses,,.we
both run the ball."

According to Grinnell Coach Jim
Dunne,heltkes the way his team looks
right now. .

“I like our health situation," he said.
“DanandTravlsplayedlntheChariton
game and they played well. We are
fortunate that we are 100 percent
healthy."

On paper, Grinnell has the edge over
Decorah, but that is just on paper. The
Vikings have racked up 3,551 yardsof
total otrense while the Tigers have
3,831 yards of offense. Defensively,
Decorah has allowed 2,302 yards, in
cluding 1,016 rushing and 1,286 pass
ing. Grinnell has allowed just 1,777
yards defensively, 886 on the ground,
891 in the air.

"Itis going tobe an extremelyphysi-
cal game,” said Dunne. ”Both teams
have excellent offensive lines. it is up
to whatever team can stay away from

 

mistakes like penalties and rumovers.
Fieldpositioniscrucial. How we cover
the punt and the kickoff..field position
rs gorng to be key and special teams are
going to be what sets that up."

Defensive leaders for Decorah in-
clude pre-seasonall-statc twins Randy
and Ryan Fulsaas and defensive back
Shane Butler, who has eight intercepr
tions.

offensively, David Laisonhas 1,986
yards rushing off 259 carries with 3l
touchdowns this season. His twin
brother Adam has 640 yards on 142
carries and 12 TDs.

Post said Grinnell has some tough
players to match up with his own.

“We have our work cut out for us,
he said. “Grinnell‘s fullback and rune
ning back, we have to control them.
Gnnnell's quarterback can alsorunthe

good offensive attack to work around.
I expect the game to be physical, hard-

viously. When you get into this situa-
tion, both teams will be excited, it will
depend on how the teams control their

Once again, authorities had hoped
that an admitted serial killer might be
tied to the 1992 rape and murder of a
Grinnell College student, but the brief
optimism that the ease might be solved
was dashed this week.

IllinoisStatePoliceinitiallysaidthey
hoped to interview Wayne Adam Ford
in connection with the slaying of
Tammy Zywickj, 21, who was ab~
ducted and killed while en route to
Grinnell College in August 1992.

But records show that Ford, who
confessedto Califomiaauthoritiesthat
he had killed four women while work-
ing as a cross-country trucker, was
working as a school bus driver at the
time of the murder.

Zywicki’s disabled car was found
along Interstate 80 near LaSalle, 111.,
on Aug. 23, 1992. Her body was dis-
covered in southwest Missouri a week
later.

She was last seen alive near her car,
a truck parked close to the disabled

Gingrich departs, still
blaming someone else

Newt Gingrich's astonishing decision to fall on his own sword and resign
as speaker ofthe U.S. House ofRepresentatives shocked Washington and set
ofa scramble among would-be successors. It belied the image ofthe Scrapper
and the ﬂamethrower, but Gingneh‘s remarks to congressional allies re-
minded everyone ofthe speaker's inability to concede his own shortcomings
Typically, he blamed others for what he had engineered himself.

News reports about Gingnch‘s telephone conversation with House
colleagues indicated that be faulted “a handful of members [who] have
blackmailed the party conference." He called those alleged insurrectionists
“hateful" and “Cannibals."

By now, most people know what preceded Gingrich’s abrupt resignation
from the speakership 7 and, it now seems likel , from his congressional
seat. thgnch, along with House Majority Lea er Dick Armey, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and other higher-ups decided shortly before the
election to spend $10 million on ads directly attacking President Clinton in
some select congressional districts. The idea was twofold: to energize the
conservative faithful and to dishearten Democrats to the extent that they
would stay home instead orvote.

The move backﬁred, ofcourse. At one time, predictions had Republicans
gaining 30 or more seats — some said 50 gains were within reach. But when
the dust settled aﬁer the election, the GOP was stunned. Democrats actually
gained ﬁve seats in the House and held their own in the Senate. Conventional
wisdom has it that, in a non-presidential election year, the party that doesn’t
hold the White House routinely enjoys legislatrve gains. It didn’t happen 7
not even with all the muck and mire that characterized this campaign. ’

Although the GOP loss was Viewed widely as a signiﬁcant setback, it
hardly could be compared with what happened to the Democrats in 1994. In

that watershed year, Uingnch led
the Republican Revolutloll in which
his party look firm control of both
houses of Congress and began
working on the Contract With
America, the conservative manifesto
that served as the framework for the
party's legislative agenda. It was a
milestone in American politics, and
Glngnch assumed much ofthe
credit. But a certain hubris crept in,
and the speaker began to overstep.
His political pronouncements became rrrore confrontational than ever, and he
fancied himself as having more power than any other politician, including the
president.

Slowly, things began to unravel. It was the Gingrich Congress that was
blamed for the government shutdown brought about by the president's veto
oflegislatlon. Gingrich himselfbecame the target of an ethics investigation
involving GOPAC, the political action commlltcc. And in this year's
congressronal session, the prcsrdent again succeeded in wrnnrng concessions
on legislation, despite his alleged weakness relating to thc Monica Lewinsky
scandal. And on Election Day, voters sent a very clear message: Knock off
the interminable investigations and get to work on the country‘s business.

Most believe that, had Gingrich decided to fight, he would have succeeded
in winning re-eleciion as House speaker. Yes, there was a coup altcmpt
underway; but the speaker probably could have rallied enough support to
squelch it, although not without sustaining some serious wounds. Instead, he
chose to pick up his marbles.

It’s not yet clear how history willjudge Newt Gingrich, But one thing is
clear: he has been a towering figure in Washington, at once a man ofidcas
and a slashrandebum combatant.

House Republicans now have the uncnviable task orprovirrg that they can
reunite and work productively over the next two years, [flhcy can‘t. chances
are they'll lose their congressional mayority in 2000.
