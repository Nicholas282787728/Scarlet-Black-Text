Voting Not the Answer

plain aboutpcoplc not votingin clear

(ions, You assume that everyone ts
approachingour problems item the same
paradigm Everyone has din'cicni parii~
digins, and i thought I‘d share a little or
mine with you.

It began with people upset with me
because I didn't vote in [his election r
because i haven‘t applied tor an absentee
ballot and how pathetic it 13 llml I don‘t
care about those local races But 1 don‘t
really care i‘nt not looking for some
external force to change my his. The
issue of where every penny or my taxes
goes. or even how much i pay in taxes
seems really trivial to me, Your experir
slice ofthc world is based 99.9% on how
you perceive it. and what you do . not on
how much you pay in [axes or how you
feel about thC country spending an extra
billion dollars a year on new school bus
headlights.

Besides, in spent to hours reading
up on the politics and who believes in
what only to ﬁnd out that EVERYBODY
bElleveS they are right, and that l‘m no
iniallibleyudge to say what is right for
everyone else when I haven‘t really can
Sidered what I think is right for myself. I
mean, if people who say. "Yeah, I'm
voting tor Davis, because she believes in
improving the situation tor the homeless
oilowa," or whatever, would actually go
outand dosomethtngaboutttthen maybe
they could make a difference. I'm sick of
annchairpeopie;annchairhomelesssup-
porters. armchair GLB rights supporters.
armchair Volunteers etc, if half of
these supporters cared, they wouldn't be
supporters. they‘d be activists Iflherc‘s
somethingyou believeinstronglyenough
to get all hurry about someone else not
believing it. why are you sitting there
argutng7 Go out and do something, make
something oiyourscir. lead by example.
Enough of this hypocritic bullshit ale
ready.

Maybe l'injust more apathetic than
mostotherpeoplc, intactl‘mprettysuie
lam But to me. political issues are noias
signiﬁcant as people perceivethem. The
solution to [he problems of [he human
race, and to the problems ofsociely are
NOT going to be solved by ciccting a
particularomcial oveianothcr, The place
to start is with your own value system,

Another thing that makes me not:
about politics is the fact that the people
running for something spend so much
money Omitted i don‘t know a lot about
politicsbut my impression isthatCandi-
date A Spends 50 million whilt: Candie
date B spends 45 million dollars. A‘s
platform is “I want to help the area by
providing 20 million dollars tor a giant
city park,“whtlccandidd|eB says “i want
to spend 15 million on it homeless shelter
AND 8 million on improving the police
force." Isn't it better to spend the 95
million they spent on the campaign and
fulﬁll both nfthcirgoals7 It‘s a game or
power hungry people playing king orthc

I get really annoyed when people com

mountain at our expense Ibcl that it we
started putting the tnoncy we waste on
clcctions to more appropriate uses we
could alleviate some oftlic biggest prob
lems in society.

But. people continue to waste time,
money and cffori on the same thing. it's
reallyamazingwhatcanbedbncitpoople
get up oi'i their asses and do something,
Look at the ﬂooding in Des Momes two
summers ago. Look at the Habitat tor
Humanilyhouselhalwasl'inishedinGrin-
nell. Instead of arguing about all the
issues all the time. why not go out into
society nnd parttcrpale in something?

Dining Hall Policy:
"Don't Eat, Don‘t Come?"

y denying Jewish students the
B option of having a kosher meal

plan, Gnnnell College is effecs
tivcly discriminating on the basis or
religion. The problem is simple. Col-
lege policy requires first»years and
sophomores to ltveinthedorms. When
this requirement is coupled with the
requirement that all dorm residents be
on either a 21 mealrarweek plan then it
follows that all students entering Grin-
nell as firsteyears must eat in the dining
hall. However, there are current stur
dents and prospective students whose
religious boners and practices prevent
them from eating in ihc dining halls.
Forthesestudentstheruaretwooptions.
tor those already on campus the choice
is eiihcrto leave Grinnell or itihey Stay
at thecollegc. leavccampus(someihing
that cannot be done until Junior year).
For ptospcctivcs, the choice is even
simpler. it they call to ask Dining Scr—
viccsifkosher meals are available, they
are toldtlial ittsbcttcrnbt tucnmetn the
first place. (We will not discuss llert:
better for whom.)

What is the message being sent by
aninstitutionthatsupposcdlywclcomes
diverstty7 1t too is simple. “We wcl-
come Jews at Grinnell. but please don‘t
be int) Jewish, Please, come and have
Israeli Dinners so we can taste your
exotic national foods (6:00 in Younker
Loungetonight, by the way. all are wel»
come). please help us organize Jewish
Cultural Week so lhal we can 'spict: up‘
cultural life at Grinncll. but iiyour rclir
gious practices are too different from
ours, please share them with someone
else," A student who recently ap-
pronclied the adminis|ralion about his
need ror kosher food was told “keeping
kosher is your chotce.“ Actually, from
the polnlofvlewoflhepcrsonInVOlVCLli
it is not a choice, but a religious obligar
lion An traditional Jew has no more
choice about keeping kosher than an
praclictngChnslian does believinngic
Chrislto be divine. Worse, they Continr
ucd "The hoard plan requirements ncl—

is the heart otthc problem. By iorcirig

by refusing a viable alternative, the ad-

Wok Bar Response

R comparing the enacts ol’ wok

it's all true! This is a health hazard of
