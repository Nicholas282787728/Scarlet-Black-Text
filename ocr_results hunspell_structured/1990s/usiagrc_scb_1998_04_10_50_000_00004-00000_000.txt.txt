Turn on the radio

Part sixteen in an on-going
series of KDIC deejay interviews.

Alias: Nancy Naughty. Real identity: unknown.
Here are the facts—she belongs to the class 0
‘98 and hosts the radio show “Left of the Dial.”
Annika Engineer sat with her for an entire hour
and this is what she managed to uncover:

AE: So, how did you come up
with the name of your show?

NN: It's actually from the Re
placements.

AE: Umm yeah,..I take it that's the
name ofa band?

NN: Yeah. it‘s a song by them.
When I started the show I thought
the Replacements were cool but
about a week or two into it, I decided
they were just OK. So 1 very rarely
play them on my show.

AE: And, just out of curiosity,
how did you arrive at the alias
“Nancy Naughty"?

NN: Well, I was thinking ofall
the old groupies from the NY
punk scene, basically like Gyda
Cash or Sable Star and I thought
Nancy Naughty would be good.

AE: That’s a pretty provocae
tive name, especially coupled
with the fact that your show is
called “Left of the Dial." What
type of music can one expect to
hear when they tune in?

NN: Anything loud, obnoxious
or really difficult to listen to.
There’s no particular genre that I
draw from, 'cuz I don‘t like to lis-
ten to anything that makes sense.
Basically, a lot of noise and a lot
ofpeople screaming. Iplay a lot
of Alex Chilton, not necessarily
because he’s really loud and ob-
noxious but because he’s really
quiet ...just to piss everybody off.
So that‘s cool, And I play a lot of
Richard Hell, Johnny Thunders,
MCS, Stooges anything from early
70‘s punk all_ the way up to recent
anti»establishment. loud, insurgent
stuff.

AE: What kind of response do you
think that the Grinnell campus has
posited towards your show?

NN: Well, when I ﬁrst started
people weren’t watching Ally
MeBeol as often. so there were more
students who would listen to it, of
course. So. people who tuned in
made comments like, “What the hell
is wrong with you?“ Or" Ithink there
was something wrong with KDIC
while your show was on."

AE: What kind of following do
you think you have?

NN: There are a number of
townies who are very big fans of my
show, so whenever I crawl into the
bar after my show, they always come
up to me and since they’re older they
actually know what I‘m playing, so
they really enjoy it.

AE: So the campus itself doesn't
really have a very positive reaction
to your show then?

NN: Well, they stopped respond—
ing altogether once that'bitch Ally
McBeal started to take over my
world but Nancy Naughty will Lrie
umph overAlly McBeal. Don’t you
worry. I’ll blow her ears out.

AE: Do you advertise for your
show at all?

NN: No.1don‘t. Iprobably should
but I ﬁgure if people really want to
listen to it, they’ll be listening to it.
It’s not really music that appeals to
very many college students.

AE: Why do you say that?

NN: Unun ...it‘s too good. I can’t
say that I’ ve had a show so far where
I've played anything that anybody on
this campus has necessarily listened

 

to before. Any of the artists I play on
my show have absolute Zero follows
mg at this godeforsaken hotbed of
crapepop.

AE. Do you think that the people
on this campus are fairly stereotypi-
cal in their tastes and are not really
willing to try something new or dif
ferent?

NN: Well, punk is difﬁcult for a
lot of peopleand most ofthe people
who listen to punk on this campus
listen to commercial punk. This is
stuff that ls just completely off the

wall and a lot of the time it sounds
like crap too and people here can‘t
listen to music that sounds like crap.

AE: OK, excuse my ignorance but
why would anyone want to listen to
something that sounds like crap?

NN: Well I think that some of the
best things in music come out of
music that sounds like crap. When
people are playing crap it‘s like data.
Instead of trying to show off, these
people are working with their raw
emotions, It’s not like they’re play—
ing any chords or any beats or any
thing. They’re just making a whole
lot of noise and that sounds good to
me. I mean, essentially, it’s rockin’,
it‘s kickass, it’s...badass. That’s the
word.

AE: Why is it badass 7

NN: It’s fun because they’re just
mocking society so itjust makes you
laugh a lot.They just sit there and yell
out a string of obscenities; but they’re
doing it more to be funny and to try
and vent their aggressions than to try
and impress anybody.

AE: Maybe that’s why they don’t
have very big followings. So what is
the main objective of your show, if
it’s not to get people to listen to it?
What do you get out of it?

NN: It’s very self-indulgentreally
but I‘mhoping thatpeople will acci-
dentally turn on their stereos to
KDIC and maybe think for a mo-
ment. “Wow, I’ve never heard any-
thing like this before.” But really I
just do it to piss people
off...especially the college commu-
nity. And I choose a lot of songs with
lyrics that I know will piss off cer
tain PC groups.

AE: So your show is provocae
tive...

NN: Yeah, well it‘s supposed to
make you laugh but ifyou take your-
self too seriously, it‘s gonna really

piss you off. Butjust get rczilly drunk
and everything will be really funny
to you. Ijust want to convey that
music that has zero pop appeal is
music that can say more to you than
anything else.

AE: What does this kind ofmusic
say to you?

NN: Well, it says get drunk, f**k
shit up and break a lot of things and
hope the cops don‘t get you but if

_ they do, spit on them.

AE: Word! So would you conSldcr
this a positive message for the cam-
pus community?

NN: No. I would consider this
very negative and’that’s what’s so
cool about it.

AE: Would you call your show
unique in any respect?

N'N: Yeah. Well, as a first year I
have to admit, Idid host a radio show
called “Anarchy Hour" and although
I screamed "anarchy.
anarchy,anarchy” a lot and played a
lot of Sex Pistols I wouldn't say that
[was necessarily trying to incite vio-
lence in the way that I am this year.

AE: Have you had any suc-
cess?

NN: God, have I 7 Well, we
broke some bottles off the roof at
KDIC once...and there is the
young man who put his hand

, through a mirror in Younker hall
that I believe was inspired by the
ubliminal messages of my show.
I know that we’ve sent at least 4~
5 people to the mental hospital this
semester because the demons of
drinking and f**king shit up were
just too much for them to handle,
’ and they went in and got
resocialisd and they‘re now popu'
lar Inter»varsity Christian fellow-
ship leaders.

AE:Any other trouble?

, NN: I also inspired two popuV
lar TV game shows and somehow
forced, through the waves of mu»
sic, an elderly couple to do “The

Funky Chicken" at a small wedding
in New Sharon.

AE: If you were to describe your
radio show in one sentence or less,
how would you describe it?

NN: Umm...kick out the jams

SUMMER“

Romy & Michelle’s
High School Reunion

BéXX$XX$X

Directed by David Mel'kin. Stare
ring Mira Sorvmo and Lisa Kudrow.

Let's say you like television.
There have to be some shows you
hate, right" Now, let's assume that
one of these shows is “Friends,"
Now, which is the worst character
on “Friends"? ’I‘Ilc answer would
have to bc Phocbc‘, That’s Lisa
Kudrow, Anti shc happens to be the
star of this movie, playing pretty
much the some cllnraclcr.

This really should have been a ter-
rible movie. 'I‘wo friends go to ahlgh
school leultion and pretend to be
more important people than they [6*
ally are. Tins is a trite and generally
not funny plot dCVlCC.

However, for some reason I can-
not even begin to fathom, this movie
clltlcd up being pictly funny. I don’t
know wily, itjust is. Thisis,Iguess,
olle of those “guilty pleasure" mov-
ies. The kind you like but your
friends mock you for. Like Billy
Mar/iron. And it has Janeane
Garofalo in it, so it has to be good

But before 1 get all carried away,
we should slow down. It’s worth
only 3 stars. The laughs are defl—
nitely there, but far too infrequent
to make this a really good movie. But
it does have its moments, and they
make the piece worthwhile. Check
oiit the dream sequence 2/3 of the
way through.

Pump Up the Volume

Directed byAllan Moyle. Stan‘ing
Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis.

Several years ago, lJZICk before he
was beating up his girlfriend and car-
rying guns through airports, Chris-
tian Slater had quite the career as an
actor. This was one of his ﬁlms. He
pirates a radio station, mayhem en»
sues, some kid kills himself. Wacky,

This movie’s all about how the man's
trying to hold him down. Kind ofa
prelude for his later life, don’t you
think?

Duck Soup

Starring the Marx Brothers!

Damn} My Computerjust crashed!
I was just saying how this is a Marx
Brothers film, and how they are
funny in a classic, vaudeville, none
sensically ridiculous kind of way.
This movie should make you laugh
even if you prefer comedy made dur-
ing our half of the century. Plus, you
can spend themoviethinking ofhow
Groucho ended up n lecherous old
man (kind oflike your own grandfae
liter) ifyou don‘t enjoy his smart»ass
one-liners in the movie.

Starship Troopers

Directed by Paul Veerhoven. Star—
ring a bunch of young whelps who
don‘t know what it‘s like to have to
work your way to the top,

Know what I like about this
movie? The campy title. Know what
I don't like, (or at least whatI
wouldn’t like ifI bothered to see it)?
The fact that it is like every other
xenophobic action movie since the
beginning oftime. This variation has
a bunch ofgiant bugs running around
(which in my mind is less frighten-
ing then a bunch of small bugs run-
ning around) killing people, The
people respond by sending a bunch
ofkids to kill the bugs when they are
not too busy having sex with each
other. Lame-ass special effects ve-
hicle to the max, with a hint of praise
for the fascist form of government,
