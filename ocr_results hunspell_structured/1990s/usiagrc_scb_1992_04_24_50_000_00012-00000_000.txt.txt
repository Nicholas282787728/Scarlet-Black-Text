Despite the factthattt was brought

to an early conclusion by lighming, ‘

lastSaturday's Grinnell/DeLong clas-
sic was a success for both the Pioneer

menand women. Sincethe lightning ‘

did not strike until late afternoon,

Grinnell runners had time to setsevr _ I

eral personal bests. The nature of the
meet, which did not record team
scores,was conducive to outstanding
individual performances.

0n the women's side, the 4X100
relay team of Missy Ebitz. Melanie
Parson. Jennifer Jones, and Kate
Peterson set a school record of52:52.

This mark was good enough to earn ‘

them eighth place.

Peterson also set a personal mark
in the 200, with a time of 27:29,
which allowed her to finish seventh.
In the 400, she placed eighth, with a
personal best time of 62:35. "Kate's
off-season training is proving to be an
asset. It just goes to show you that
dedication to hard work can help im-
prove performances," remarked coach
Evelyn Freeman.

Other personal bests were turned
in by Jessica Henry in the 3000, with
a time of l l:29, and by Gretel Keifer
in the 1500 with a time of 5:29.
Maureen Ness and Laura McKlveen
also recorded outstanding perfor-
mances in Lite 5000 and 400, respec-
tively. McKlveen placed seventh in
that event, despite rainy conditions.

For the Pioneer men, the stars of
the day wereChtisGarrnan and Chris
Mills. Gaman and Mills took ﬁrst
and third in the 10,000 with times of
31:49 and 33:25:49.

Unfortunately for the Pioneers, the
rain did have some adverse effects.
Pole vaulter Lee Kraemer was pre—
vented from taking his third attempt

at clearing ﬁfteen feet, so he was
awarded second place, as a result of
having one more miss at 14‘6" than
the champion. Torn Nuzum also
tumed in a personal best in the pole
vault, ﬁnishing sixth with a jump of
14'.

Other outstanding performances

were given by triple jumper Tony

place, and Darren Young, who placed
second in the 200 with a timcof22z6.

Baseball team takes conference
leading Monmouth to the wire

By Jason Wolf

Last Saturday, the Pioneers played
a doubleheader against the confer-
ence leading Monmouth College
Scots. The Scots, who have eight
seniors in their starting lineup, used a
combination of fine defense and
timely hitting to beat the Pioneers by
scores of 4-2 and 9-2.

in the first game, Monmouth sent
their ace hurler, Jake Libby to the
mound. Libby, who coach Patt Foster
called “the premiere pitcher in the
conference," allowed eight hits but
only two runs to the Pioneers. Libby
had not given up eight hits in a game

since his freshman year.

The Pioneers countered by send-
ing their ace,junior Mark Lohmann,
to the hill. For the second straight
game, Lehmann pitched a master
piece of a game, allowrng only four
runs to the defending conference
champions. Unfortunately,his team-
mates wcre unable to produce more
than two runs.

After a spectacular play to end the
seventh inning, in which third
baseman Brendan Mahon threw out a
Monmouth runner at the plate, the
Pioneers thought they had gained the
momentum needed to score the three
runs that would be necessary to win,

However, wtth one out and a runner
on first, Mahon, who had three hits
for the day, hit a ground ball that the
Monmouth shortstop managed to
come up with and turn the double
play to end the game. “It‘s frustrat-
ing thatitlookagrcat play to bcatus.
That‘s how well we plttycd against
these guys," satd first baseman
Landon Boyer after the game.

In the second game, the Pioneers
quicklyjumped out to all tend. On
the mound for Grinnell was senior
southpaw Steve Johnston. The co-
captain held the Scots in check for
ﬁve innings before losing his control
in the sixth. In an inning that was

interrupted by a torrential downpour,
Johnston walked several batters and
gave up seven runs. After the rain
delay, sophomore second baseman
Justin Hupfcr was summoned to the
mound to put an end to the Scots.

Once again, however, the Pioneers
were only able to score two runs, and
itwas notcnough to beat Monmouth.
“Youth and inexperience for us is
really showing itself," said Foster.
The team travels to Knox College
today to play in the Midwest Conferv
enee South Division tournament,
where, according to Foster, they
“should be able to make things inter-
esting for the top teams.”
