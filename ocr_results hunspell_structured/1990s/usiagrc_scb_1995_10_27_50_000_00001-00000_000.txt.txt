FormerDesMoinesschoolboartl
member Jonathan Wilson visited
Grinnell last Monday and addressed
a large audience on the issue of gay
marriage.

Wilson, havmg recently come
our as an openly gay man, lost his
position on the Des Moines school
board to a member of the religious
right earlier this year. Before this
loss. Wilson was one ofelghr openly

. gay school board members in rhe
country.

“Gay people are taught to de.
spisc themselves." Wilson said, nor-
ingrhar“someorrhemosrhoinopho
bic people" he knows are gay. He
alsospoke ofliisobservation that the
compounding of societal
homophobia and the tlesire for inn»
inacyoiten results in“selfdestructive
behavior,"such that gay people have
extremedifficultyinestablishingmo—
nogamous, committed relationships.
Wilson noted that “there are no
guidcposrs or role models for permor
nent, monogamous same gender re—
lationships."

Wilson remarked that the lack
of discussion concerning gay issues
and the negatiVity of any discussion
thatdoeshappen,“perpetuatesmyths
and misinformation." and “inhibits
rhe ability ro come to the realization
of one’s sexual identity."

Referring to the recent case be—
fore the Hawaii Supreme Court con—
cerning samesex marriage, Wilson
noted that a "revolution" in how
marriage is perceived |S imminent.
The case will be decided by 1997, at
which time it is likely that gay, lesbi—
an, bisexual and transgendered peo«
ple will be able to freely obtain mar—
riage licensesand getmairied. Those
who are married in Hawaii may then
choose to live in states where gay
marriage is not legally recognlied,

which will cause maior problems,
according to Wilson.

“Eachstategetstodecidewheth—
er the issue of gay marriage then
offends public policy," said Wilson.
Many states have tried to pass legis<
laturc which would effectively our—
law gay marriage.

According to Wilson, “lowa
could be a test case" for the press, in
its attempt to decide such matters.
“We must build coalitions, we must
educate" in order to prevent siich a
movement, hesaid. He alsoremarked
that “in a democracy, decisions are
made by rhe number of people who
show up," and rhar ii is our responsi.
biliry to prevent the encroachment
of the conservative ideology of the
radical right.

In an inrerview following his
speech, Wilson spoke of his coming
out, which happened publicly at a
school board meeting. “I chose to
come our rhe way I did in order to
preventembarrassmenttotheschool
districtand to myself. ltwas betterto
come out on my own terms, in my
own ivay, than ro wair for ir to hop.
pencontentiously,unpredictablyand
at the behest of my detractors," he
said. Additionally, he noted that his
“continued silence gave the wrong
message, that there was somerhing
secretive“ and wrong about being

A Des Monies lawyer, Wilson
has no plans to run for the school
board again. He has been accepting
speaking engagements around the
country at various colleges. universi-
ties andorganizations, givingspeech—
es on “a wide range oftopics," some
of which include issues concerning
gay rights, diveisity, and racial inte—
gration in schools, he said.

“There is a virus ofintolerance,"
sweeping the country, Wilson said,
“It is never dying, and no generation
is exempt from fighting it."

On Tuesday, October 24th, the
newly formed Diversity Initiatives
Committee atGrinnellOollege con-
ducted an open meeting with stu—
dents to share their progress this se—
mestcr.

Many of the Committee's 18
members attended the meeting and
reported on the discussions and ac—
tions which have already occurred
on campus and their plans for the
future. Their reports reﬂected the
Committee‘s emphasis on a cultural—
ly diverse student and faculty body,
the need for “sensitivity" or multi—
cultural ttaining and the diversity of
perspectives in academic courses.

The Diversity Initiatives Com—
mittee was formed this semester by
College President Pamela Fergison,
partially in response to the discus—
sion among students last semester of
“diversityfriction,“asFrankThomas
explained. Thomas, the coordinator
of the Committee, also recognized
rhe attention sparked by a silent pro.
rest last spring by black srudenrs on
campus as an event which prompted
theadministrationtoformthisgroiip
to respond to issues ofdiversity and
millticultiiralism in race. class, ethr
nicity and gender.

On Tuesday, the Committee
members reported on the numerous
discussions and aetlons which affect
many areas of the College.

“This year, we saw less positive
numbers in enrolling Asian—Ameri—
can students and . . . African-Amen
ican students," reported James Lin—
coln, Vice—President of Enrollment.
He emphasized rhe continued efforts
of the enrollment office to attract a
diverse student body which also re-
sulted in an increase in the enroll<
merit numbers of Latino and Native
American students this year. Lin—
coln said, "One of the major things
we’re doing is getting students to
campus."

The New Science Program is
“very highly regarded by students" in

or in science majors,” said Swartz.

The Committee has also been
developing a program for the re.
cruitmentofaculturallydiverse inc»
ulty. Alice Kellar, Vice—President
for Human Resources, said, “We
have made tremendous strides in
that area," and reported that 10.5%
of the administrative and profession—
al staff is filled by persons of color.
She expressed the Committee‘s sat—
isfaction over that number as well as
over the addition ofa person ofcolor
to the College’s support staff.

Kellar explained that their suc—
cess in arrracring a diverse pool of
applicanrs (or Human Resources
positions has come from the diversi—
ty of advertisement and outreach
programs for those positions. But in
finding a diverse pool to fill academ—
ic faculty positions, Charles Duke
indicated, “'lhere are very few mit
nority candidates." Dulce, the Dean
of the College, acknowledged the
difficulty that the College has expe—
rienced in creating an adequately
diverse academic faculty body.

Tom crady, Dean of student
Affairs,echoedconcei—nforthisprob—
lem, Although rhe sriidenr staff in
the residence halls reﬂects its high-
est percenrage or colored students at
35%, Crady recognized rhe need for
a diverse menral health staff, which
continues to surier from rhe lack of
qualified applicants and funds. He
emphasised rhar, among orher

schoolsinthenation, Orinnellmain-
tains the highest ratio of students to
mental health professionals, and the
need for diversity among the profes<
sional staff still remains a goal.

As one studenr argued of rhe
mental health services, “I don’t think
the sysrem works very well.” The
student claimed that the Residence
Life Coordinatois and mental health
professionals in her situation did not
have the proper cultural awareness
trainingtoadequatelytreather. Crady
mentioned that the Student Affairs
Office is continuing to search for a
mental health professional of color.

For current College faculty and
staff, both Kellar and Crady empha—
sized the need fot cultural “sensitivie
ty" or awareness training. This train»
ing would consist of educating cure
rent faculty on the perspectives and
issues involved with different cultur—
al groups. Crady clarified the neces-
sity for students to feel comfortable
with staff members, and the Commit—
tee promotes that this ttaining will
foster that awareness and comfort.
Kellar also reported that one seminar
on multicultural awareness was al—
ready conducted With the Dining
Services and another is planned.

The members of the Diversity
Initiatives Committee also reported
on the discussion and action empha»
sizing diversity in academics at
