Women's Soccer wins
third consecutive title

by Jason Wolf

The women‘s soccer team cape
tured its third consecutive Midwest
Conference championship lastweek-
end with victories over St. Norbert
and Beloit.

Saturday the Pioneers played St.
Norbert in what Coach Ted Eskildsen
considered to be the most imponant
game of the tournament Early in the
game Cindy Harris scored on a re-
bound of a comer kick by Anya
Schwartz to give Grinnell a 1-0 lead.
Ten minutes later Melanie Parson put
in a direct kick from 25 yards out.

“One of the keys was at the end
of the first half when we had our
second line halfback and forward in
the game. Theywere ableto maintain
a strong pace," said Eskildsen. With
the starters well rested for the second
half, Giten Gifford scored on a pen»
alty kick and Marta Fraboni added
another goal on a breakaway to give
the Pioneers a4—0 victory, Eskildsen
also pointed to the “tremendous ﬁeld
play" of Amy Henderson, Julie
Banuelos and Erin Kilgore as vital to
the victory.

The next day Grinnell squared
off against northern division cham-
pion Beloit which had posted a 3-1
victory over Knox. Weather condi-
tions were less titan ideal, with gusty

winds up to 40 miles per hour, sub—
freczing temperatures, and a pclting
rain coming directly across the field.

Fifteen minutes into the firsthalf
Amy Neevel hit a perfect pass to
Maria Fraboni, who knocked it in to
give the Pioneers a 1-0 lead. While
the Pioneers never relinquished its
lead, Beloit came close to scoring
numerous times. “Every one of our
fullbacks came up with huge defen-
sive plays when Beloit came knockr
itig on the door." said Eskildsen.

In the second haleskildsen, in a
strategic move designed to counter
the weather conditions, moved Amy
Jo Reinhart and Schwanz from the
lefttotherightsideoftheficld. "Their
defense and ball control set the tone
for the rest of the game,” he said.

With five minutes remaining,
Harris iced the title by scoring and
giving the twin a 2-0 win. This was
the last game for the five Grinnell
seniors 7 Schwartz, Reinhart,
Fraboni, Karissa Taylor and Aine
Fowler. Over the last four seasons
they have compiled a 49»10»2 record,
including a 32-1 record in conference
play. “ltwas an honor for me to have
had the five seniors on the field when
the game concluded because that is
wheretheydeservedtobe,"concluded
Eskildsen.

Men’s Soccer takes second at home
Midwest Conference tournament

by Alex Severens

A magnificent season, and a
magnificent gameended in bitter frus-
uation Sunday when the Grinnell
College men‘s soccer mam took sec-
ond place in the Midwest Conference
Tournament. Lake Forest withstood
the muddy field, the constant frigid
rain and the bitter wind chill just a
little better than the Pioneers. After
the four overtime periods and the
shootout were finally over, the For
esters had a 1-0 victory.

The two best defenses in the con—
ference showed what they were all
about as the game ended regulation,
070. After four more 15-minute
overtimes. the deadlock remained at
070. After such a strong showing
from both learns, itseemcd sad thata
championship trophy could not be
awarded to both teams, buta shootout
had to take place to declare a winner.
The Lake Forest goalie had an amaz-

ing stop and a Grinnell shot skidded
wide. TheForestcrs. meanwhile, put
in all four goals they attempted in the
shootout.

The few brave fans who chal-
lenged the elements and stayed to
watch the entire garneknow how bru-
tal the weather was,and they can only
stand in aweof the efforts puifonh by
both twms. The fatigue and exhaus-
tion after playing 2 1/2 hours of soc~
ccr began to take its toll on both learns
as the coaches were looking dcspcra
ately up and down their benches for
fresh players.

Coach Pfitsch and his 4070dd
years ofcoaching testified to the con-
dition of his players after such a long,
drawn out affair. “I have never seen
the results ofexhaustion, fatigue and
inclement weather take such a toll on
a group." There was hardly a Grin-
ncll player who was not adversely
affected by the rough game and the
dreadful weather conditions. Three
ofPliLsch’s importantdcfensiveplay-
ers suffered minor hypothermia by
the end of the game. Also the very
physical nature of the game meant
that several players were playing on
adrenaline alone by the time the final
overtime period ended.

“The exhaustion became so in-
tense that by the time the shootout
started there was not a flicker of cm
orgy in those kids. I had a hard time
just finding five kids who could kick
the penalty shots," said Pfitsch. “I
don‘t know who really had the better
team out there,butbccause of the way
the rules work, Lake Forest came out
ahead."

“I was so proud ofhow weplayed
in that game —I really could not ask
for anything more. it was just a

magnificent ball game,” were
Pfitsch's positive remarks after the
game. He was amazed at theintensity
andtenacityhisplayerskeptup,espe-
cially on the defensive end. “Goalie
Nate Brennarnan and fullback Keith
Klingler played the games of their
lives, and it was just wonderful to see
them put forth such amazing effort."

Pfitsch also praised Dave Eslinger,
Chung Chac, Ian Carlson and Nick

Johnson. Those four made up much
of the defensive front thatkept Lake
Forest at bay the entire game.

Grinnell was at a disadvantage
because scnior stopper Doug l-lodum
had received a red card in Saturday‘s
first round, thus making himself In-
eligible for the championship game.
Hodum was forced to watch the final
game of his senior year from theside-
line, but Pfitsch said of his covcap—
rain, “He kept the guys going on the
sideline and was still an important
part of the team.”

Grinnell won the first round-
game against Beloit, 3-1, Saturday.
Beloit wenton to take the third place
honors by beating Monmouth, 571,
Sunday.

Five senior starters saw their last
gamc Sunday in a loss to the same
team that defeated them last year.
Pfitsch said ofhis seniors, “It is cxpcr
rience which makes a difference in a
championship game like this. and I
could tell that our players, and espe-
cially the seniors, were not aertid or
intimidated at all. They were pre-
pared mcntally rind they did every-
thing they could to ensure a victory.
It is too bad that it was not enough.”
The 11-3-2 recordby the 1992team is
one of the best ever posted by a Grin-
nell team.
