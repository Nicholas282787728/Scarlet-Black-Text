Low budget literature

The semester is nearly half over, soon it will be time to receive our
paychecks. Most media heads at Grinnell receive $275 for their time and
effort. To most individuals, this seems a nice fringe benefit included with the
natural satisfaction garnered while performing one's duties. And it is. That
is, if one already has sufficient ﬁnancial stability to look upon it as a perk
rather than a payment. The reality for students who must work to fulfill
ﬁnancial aid agreements is much different. For them, 3275 is merely a drop
towards a difficult goal. Almostcertainly they are forced to pursue employ-
ment elsewhere, often suffering plu-
rality which threatens them academi-
cally,ﬁnancially,physicallyandmenr
tally.

This is not yetanother narcissistic
ranting by the Scarlet and Black in
order to receive more funds. It is an
elucidation of the grand paradox
which we call Grinnell College. How can this institution call itself "need
blind" whenit constructs ﬁnancial barriers blocking extracurricular activir
ties? It is clear, however, tltat the college "needs" to fill the ranks of
indentured servants (a la financial aid) who staff everything from the dining
halls to the library. Ironically, students have the power to change these
conditions. But it seems as though a skewed sense of egalitarianism keeps
them from doing so. The frayed nerves of the Grinnell inferiority complex
are terriﬁed of raising individuals onto pedestals. Instead, they offer measly
financial rewards, thereby oppressing (yes, oppressing ) their fellow student.

God forbid Grinnell should emulate other schools which showcase
positions of campus authority. After all, most of these schools are probably
well entrenched in that top ten list we don't care about, Some institutions are
bold enough to offer credit to students who accidentally learn something
while working. Others just pay them thousands of dollars. Grinnell, on
average. pays its newspaper editor-in-chief about 80 cents an hour (there’s
that ranting again). The SGA President probably makes a similar hourly
wage. Good luck candidates.

Grinnell students should be allowed access to every experience on
campus, regardless of wealth. This seems an obvious statement, yet reality
suggesrs otherwise.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
The art of being nice to White men

(I offer the followtng thoughts,
knowing full well that Grinnell stu—
dents are rapidly losing their under
standing of, and appreciation for sari
casm and lighthearted social critique,
and that someone will take this literr
ally. My condolences to you.)

The 1980's taught me one impor-
tantlesson:SelfHelpismysalvation.
If I have a problem, I must admit it,
and find agood book abouthow to fix
it. A few books, like Allen Bloom’s
The Closing of tlie American Mind
and D. D’Souza’s lllibeml
Education outline my Sympv
toms. But it is up to me to
empower myself (pull my-
self up by my own bootr
straps as it were) to regain
control of my life . . . the
controlllostwhenlencoun-
tered The Campus Atmo-
sphere. I nevcr saw it com»
ing. In 1989. when I first
enrolled as an undergradu-
ate, the possibility of my
transformation was rarely
discussed. I was not prepared for the
mutation The Campus Atmosphere
would force me through; thatI would
change from a ﬁne, upstanding Ameri-
can Citizen into the Oppressor I now
have become. I am not speaking of
any of the oppressive “isms" or
“obias” commonly discussed in con»
temporary society. My thoughts and
deeds are potentially far more dan-
gerous, subversive, and socially un-
acceptable. I am recovering from
conservaphobia,

At ﬁrst I denied it, All that hype of
those Nazi, fascist, thought policing
politically correct crazies, that
couldn’t be me, could it? My mind

it so obviously is, didn't I? I
would defend the literary
canon, and the traditional
white men who always said
it better, deeper, faster, and
cheaper, wouldn't]? I didn’t
support all those “ethnic"
multicultural ravets who
were bringing Harvard and
Yale to their academic knees
with all their unwhitc sub-
versivcsewage, did I? Surely
I didn‘t buy into all that affirmative
action crap that is trashing the stan»
dardsofhighcreducatjonwhileleav-
ing all those poor, suburbianite males
to rot.

Well, I have to hand it to those
prolific conservative writers for bulk
ingitintomy hendthathasnotquite
the fine American Citizen I thoughtI
was, Week after repetitious week,
they hounded me in their publica-
tions to shape up. And they finally
spoke ofthemsclves in the terms I, as
an unaware undergraduate in The
Campus Atmosphere, could under
stand best - OPPRESSION. I mean
what could I, one of the trillion radir

more readily grasp than this theory
straight out of Marx (that‘d be Karl
and notGroucho). Admittedly, I was

ideas would reign victorious. Their
theory. although I never was much
for it, was very useful to them at the
time in supporting a whole hoast of
majoritarian “most people like it that
way“ policy areas. But as the white
male majority shrinks, so must one’s
theory - change that is, not shrink!
Now they ﬁnally have a theory I can
relate to, Marxist Conservatism! Just

The best part is that MarxistCon-

my own cleverly disguised
Conscrvaphobia.0penminded7 Well,
I've always been one of those card
earring ACLU types(y0uknow,those
leftists who got Buchanan and Duke
on the Republican Ballot). so I never
did get into that “McCarthyite” cenr
sorship. book bunting, and state tri-
bunal witch hunting thatcostsomany
Harvard Professors their jobs (none).
But I do speak my mind, and I dohave
opinions, and clearly that’s not very

openminded or nice of me. Some
people argue that conservatives are
no more openminded than anyone
else, citing their loathing of “new
fangled" ideas in education (like
women’s studies and non-Western
classes)asonccxamplearnongmany.
But conservatives must be more
openminded titan everyone else be»
cause, well, they tell us so. On this
very campus, conservatives deserve

(with a hand-out from the John Birch
Society, granted) to speak
through their provocative
and predictable under-

ings such as theirs helped
me to see my own diaboli-

may say, to overthrow
Western Civilization. And
recently I discovered just

a friend ”will kneel behind the West

say the least. And truly he is not the
only example of rampant
conservaphobia in our academic
world. Some people actually buy the
incredulous idea that their education
will benefit from that horrorific
multicultural atmosphere so many
sillyestablishmentacademicsblather
about; an atmosphere that could one
day make my white self uncomfort-
able on MY campus! I too once enter-

So my thanks to the new Marxist

mentors nationwide. By their merg~

I am sure. leading academic institur
tions like Grinnell will offer studies
in conservative oppression. But then
again, that may be too new fangled.
I‘ll have to rationalize that issue for
awhile. By the way, I hope to pay my
way through grad school (in adistinc-
tively Western discipline, naturally) .
by promoting and selling my new
self-help book, [lL] Conscrvaphobia ‘
