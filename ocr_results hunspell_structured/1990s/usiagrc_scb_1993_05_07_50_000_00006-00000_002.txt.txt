Initial plans for Fine Arts Building renovatio

by RIVA Sl-lARple

IN a few years, Grinnell College
may have an expanded and reno-
vated Fine Arts Building, accord-
ing to Presidentl’amela Ferguson
DuringameetingwiththeBoard
of Trustees in February, the col-
legewasgiven permission topro-
ceed with the initial steps of the
project.

“Right now, the Architect se-
lection process is going on," said
Ferguson "They will be hired
to draw up a plan for this
building. We are also testing
the interestofthealumniand
thecollege'sbestfriendstosee
if they Want to support the
project.”

If the renovation and im»
provement of the Fine Arts
Building goes through, it is
estimated to cost around 133
million dollars.

Members of the Grinnell Col-
lege community have been talk-

ing with the administration for

years to improve the Fine Arts
Building, whichwasbuiltin 1961.
Theatre professor SandyMoffett,
who came to Grinnell in 1971,
has been working on improving
the building for nine years.

"We started talking seriously
about the problems with Roberts
Theatre in 1984,” he said. "Our
conclusion was that if Roberts
Theatre was really going to be
renovated, it would cost three to
four million dollars. This esti-
mate made us pause in our
plans.”

Negotiations for a new build-
ing resumed in 1988 when Presi-
dent GeorgeDrake formed a com-
mittee that made the deci-
sion to improve the facili
ties of all of the ﬁne arts,
not just the theatre depart-
ment. In 1990, plans for a
entirelynewbuildingswere
drawn.

“We had a pretty good
planby1990,"saidMoffett.
”It included a new theatre,
a smaller theatre, on art
gallery, new facilities for
ofﬁces and practice rooms,
and a concert hall. But we
we're talking about 25 to 30 mt
lion dollars."

The cost of the project slowed
down plans. After Drake‘s depar-
ture and Ferguson’s arrival, the
project evolved into what it is
now, a renovation and addition
to the current building.

All three departments, art, the-

atre and music, site massive prob
lems in the existingstructure and
are happy to see the initial steps
taken toward improvement.

lack of rehearsal spaces
”The Music Department feels
that it needs a new facility to
improveboth quantityandquol-
ity,” said music professor
jonathan Knight. "In terms of
quantity, we are already stretch-
ing things past their breaking
point in order to accommodate

everyone. Some groups have to
rehearse in ridiculous placeslike
a comer of the basement, or a
faculty ofﬁce not being used at
that time.”

The music department, like
both theatre and art, is spread
out across the campus. Some re-
hearsal and practice rooms, as
well as focultyofﬁces, are located
in the Fine Arts building, while
othersarelocatedin musichouse
on Park Street. Knight sites the
quality of spaces used for both
performance and practice as
small and limiting.

“In the music house, we are
very limited as to the type of
lessons we can give,” he said.
"Theroomsareformerbedrooms
and aren’t really made for re-
hearsal. You can’t have a brass
and a guitar practicing side by
side. In doe Fine Arts Building,

facility, we could

the rooms are too small and not
acoustically designed correctly.
They have absolutely terrible cli~
mate control.”
Aproperrehearsalroomshould
ideally be two stories high for
acoustics, said Knight. Current
spaces used for concerts and re-
citals, which range from Herrick

Chapel to classrooms, are not
made for performances.

"The music department is the
most frequent user of Herrick
Chapel,” said Knight. "It’s fairly
nice acoustically because of its
shape. But the drawbacks are
many. The altar area was not
designed for groups~alter all,
it's a chapel. For performers, the
chapel is also a bit of a strain
because it’s hard to hear other
singers. There’s also no sound
insulation, so any time a train

goes by, you can hearit, along ‘

with any other noise out on
the street.”
Thebiggestproblemwith
Herrick Chapel, however, is
that it does not belong to the
music department, said
Knight. Whenever there is a
guest speaker, wedding, or
otherevent,practicesnormally
held in Herrick Chapel must be
moved.

No concert hall

In the current plan for the im-
proved Fine Arts structure, the
music department will not re-
ceivethethingthatitmostneeds,
said Knight.

"In a nutshell, we are not get-
ting a concert hall. We are get-
ting new and improved areas.
Wewillgetmoreandbetterprac-
tice rooms, a replacement of
Room 104, which right now is a
classroom used forconcerts. This
will be flipeflopped and we will
have a room for concerts that
can double as a very nice class-
room. We will also have rooms
that are the proper size and
shape.”

As of yet, the music depart»
mentlsn'tplanning anynewpro-
grams to go along with the
proposed expansion. How»
ever, Knight hopes to see a
continued expansion and
ﬂourishing of current pro-
grams.

"The music program is
already quite diverse," he
said. "In recent years, we've
had a substantial growth in
the number of students par-
ticipating. This semester we
hit a record high, which
makes us even more anxious for
more and better spaces.“

Growing participation

Theartdepartmentisalsofeel-
ing a substantial growth in par-
ticipation due to an increased
awareness of the value of a di»
verse liberal arts education, ac-

cording to art professor Robert
McKibbin. Student demands are
different now from those of stu~
dents in 1961 when the structure
was built.

”Studentsare nowinterestedin
building things that are larger,”
he said. ”The importance of the
arts has shifted and even at the
introductory levels, we’ve totally
restructured our programs We
need an expansion or renova-
tion to fully accommodate what
facultyandstudentswanttodo.”

The major problem with the
current space used by the art
departmentisitsscale.McKibbin
also points out that the exterior
ofthe Fine Arts Building is not on
the same level as the rest of the
campus.

McKibbin, who has been at
Grinnell since the early 19705,
has been discussing the inad-
equacies ofthe building since his
ﬁrst year here, he said.

"when I was ﬁrst here, I got

reallyexcitedandthoughtsome-
thing would happen. But then,
overthe years, I discoveredthatit
was always lots of talk and no
action. But I think that this ad-
ministration is different. I think
that this administration will be
more action than talk.”

Size and safety problems
Speciﬁc problems with the art

department’s space center

around its size and ventilation.
”We now know more about

’what solids, paints, and chemi-

cals will hurt you than we did in
the 19605,” he said. ”The build-
ing has always been inadequate
in ventilation. We can’t open a
window. There are fans, but they
only can do so much.”

As a result ofthe poor ventila»
lion through the years, McKibbin
has now developed many aller-
gies. He does not blame the col“
Iege,butfeelsthatitdemonstrates
the need for better ventilation

Grinnell Budgeting 1 01

your hard-eamed dollars.7

ing a huge proﬁt off the backs of
innocent college students? Are

ing around in BMW’s bought

Fortunately, there seems to be
no budgeting Conspiracy here at
Grinnell. All of the college’s $44
million in revenues for the next
ﬁscal year are accounted for by
expenditures. Halfthe money the
college spends goes toward solar
ries and another 20% covers stu-
dentf‘inancial aid. The bookstore
just barely breaks even.

Salary Shakedown?

A big priority for doe college is
paying competitive salaries to
attract top talent, according to
college treasurer David Clay.

Grinnell provides President
Pamela Ferguson with the use of
a house and a $139,000 salary.
In 199091, the average salary
for a college president in Iowa
was $82,450, according to an

August 1 992 Des Main esRegl'sler
article.

Average facultysalaries, rang-
ing from $37,300 for assistant
professors to $47,200 for associ-
ate professors to
$61,700 for professors,
are above average for

tions, according to a
