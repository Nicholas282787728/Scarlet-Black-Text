MOVIE SHORTS

 

Cadillac Man

Something ofa sleeper when it was released in 1990, I think Cadillac Mart presents some of Robin
Williams’ best work. Williams plays a rather confused, hprfvtll’lVCn Cadtll lesman thrust into
heroics during a bizzare holdrup. Titn Robbins gives a great performance as a “ 'lous type" pushed to
exucmes. The chemistry between Williams and Robbins makes for a manic but delightful movie.
Cadillac Mart will be shown on Saturday at 7:30 in Harris Cinema. -Louise Alcorn

The Killing

Directed by a young Stanley Kubrick, the 1956 movtc The Killing presents a taut story abouta gang
planning to rob a race track of two million dollars. Sterling Hayden plays the tough gang leader, anti
Torn Carey stars as a thoughtless killer. All in all. The Killing provtdes an engrossing lookat the seamier
side of horse racing. As part of the Cultural Film Series, The Killing will be shown on Friday and
Saturday at 8:00, (mil Sunday at 2:00, in ARH 302. rBrett Fechheimer

Film version

of Bonfire

can't compare to novel

By Jennifer Stukas

Based on Tom Wolfe‘s Desksell-
ing novel of the same name. the 1990
film version of The Bonﬁre af llte
Vanities starsTom Hanksas Sherman
McCoy, aYale educated, Wall Street
WASP, who‘s arrogant enough to
think himself infallible. When he
and his Southem belle mistress Maria
(Melanie Griffith) get lost in the
Bronx and accidentally injure an
African/American man, however.
Sherman comes torealizehis fallibil-
ity as his court case is politicized and
he htmselfis madcasymbolofwhiic,
upper—class society and its oppres-

sion of the lower classes.

In the book. Sherman‘s demise IS
inevitable. yet Tom Wolfe manages
to make it Litillating all the same,
teasing the reader with the hope that
someone will acknowledge
Sherman's innocence and strive for

. individual justiceabove the criesof

“justice for all," The character of
Sherman McCoy was thoroughly
odious? as he was, in a subdued.
WASPy way racist, classiSt, and full
ofhubns (hehadprivatcly titledhim-
selfa ”Master of the Universe”). Yet
more odious was the society which
allowed him to be sacrificed in the
nameofpowerand greed.artd1found
myself rooting for Sherman despite

his pomposity. _

This was the weighty subject mat-
terthatdireetorBrian DePalmacould
have attempted to ﬁt into a two-hour
feature film. Instead, he decided to
focus instead on the comedic aspects
of the storygtuming Bonfire into a
deadpan farce, wtth very time moral
impact Yet the movie still managed
to arouse Controversyitestifying for
the ability of a great book to carry a
bad movie. rather than for the greatv
ness of the movie itself.

The casting was likewise a farce.
tfonlyfor thepoorphysical represcnr
tations. 1 don’t suppose anyone teatir
ing the novel imagined the character
of Sherman McCoy' Master of the
Universe. man of the "Yale chin"7
as looking or sounding like boyish
Tom Hanks. Not of slinky Maria as
being anything like buxom Melanie
Griffith.

Likewise, the character of Peter
Fallow, so thoroughly British in the
novel, is thoroughly Americanized
by Die Hard’s Bruce Willis. Yet
these actors make the most of awk-
ward pans. playing them comfort-
ably, but unfortunately not well u
enough to save the movie.

My suggestion: read the book,

The Bonﬁre oftlie Vanities will be
shown on Saturday at 8:30 in North
Lounge.

Wife’s Tale will open Thursday

The Grinnell College Theatre De-

The Old Wife‘s Talc on Oct. 10, ll,
and 12 at 8:00 and Sunday, Oct. 13,
at 7:00 in the Arena Theatre,
Writtcnby Georcheeleim 1595,
The Old Wife's Tale seems a simple
fairy tale told by an old wife. How—
ever, as the collection of folk and
fairy characters come on the stage

and begin to take control oftheir own
stories, they seem to suggest the style
of 20th-century playwrights rather
than Peele’s Elizabethan eontetnpor
raries.

The cast on7 will fill the theater
with juggling, dancing, tumbling,
pmtfalls. singing, and acting.

Tickets will be distributed begin
ning next Tuesday. Oct. 8.
