by Presideaneiguson in an interview

that interview, to the batof my knowl-
edge, Ferguson was not implying that
those who drop out of Grinnell are
unintelligent, but rather that they rm
intelligent (based on the fact that they
go on to graduate from somewhere
else), and that is why Grinnell is Con-
cerned about the drop-out mte.

I have tourid through painiul expert:
once that many socallcd “liberals" are
among those who are the most untrust-
worthy in a personal relationship They
mlk big about the world and all of its

orien ignore/demean their own backyard
or friend standing next to dram And no
person does or says something which is
not ”politically correct,” this often results
in insmnl abandonment Many libcmls
(and socallcd “Chnstlun5”) seem to have
nonotionotiorgivcncssorundcrsianding
their neighbor.

Well. I am a “while anglosaxon
protestant male," so to some of these
liberals, my opinion is irrcvclant because
1 obvrously cannot know what suffering
or discrimination is. Without going into
detail, 1 will only point out that i have
several “wierd” ideas and have been in
many situations in which I was on tho
outside. Isiniply hope tharpcoplc whoare
conccmul about (idiots and deem thcmr
selves “liberal" will also lake the time to

' care about the person standing next to

Musical. There is a song in there with
lyrics very much related to this issue.
“Easy to be Hard"

“How can people be so heartless?
How caripooplebcso cruel? Easy Lobe
hard easy to be cold How can people

' have no feeling? How can they ignore
. their friends? Easy to be proud. Easy to

say NO. Especially people who care
about strangers. Who care aboutevil and
social injustice. Do you only care about
the bleeding crowd7 How about a need-
ing friend? I need a friend.”

How about it? Ihope you will care
about your friends and neighbols and not
dismiss them if they show streaks of
bigorry or sexism. And, please, try to
understand why somebody is or acts a
certain way. Do not allow that new gear
sin of not being “politically correct" dc-

Gnnnell hasn t lived up to Its promise

Glaring contradictions exist between rhetoric and

action in terms oft/16 African American Concentration

By DARRYL ROBERTS

Contributor

r I 1-lEcclcbr‘ationof BlackHistory Month isatimewhen history ismdiscovcrtd
and a Lime when unknown African American contributions nrcrcvcalod. It
15 a time when glaring contradictions confront us,

The history ofGrinncll College is no exception. Although this distinguished
institution has committed itself to diversifying its strident population and "5 facility
and administration, why hasn't it committed itself to making the study of African
American culture an integral elemctit of its cumculum by stafﬁng and providirtg
adequate resources for the African American concentration?

Twenty ycaisago.a group ofAli-icanArncrican students and faculty members
requested the concentration Black students protested and petitioned many
predominately white institutions to develop concentrations in Aﬁ'itzin American
studies, Grinncll College was one ofthc schools that developed concentrations and
employed faculty Iolcad them. However, it has been more than 20 years since the
concentration Wasdeveloped and it is appalling thatitis truly nobctter off todaythan
it was at its inception.

Did you know that the zoycar-old African~American Studies Concentration
stilldoes nothaveachairpcrson whosesole responsibility is to teachIritrotoAfrican
American Studies and to develop core courses for the program? Didyou lorow that
fourpmfessois otcolordcvclopodaprogranr and submitted itro thecollege and that
the adminismttion's reacn'on was to imply that those professors should teach and
admirustratc tlteconcentrzttion and that thecollegctiidn‘thave themoncytohiienew
faculty members for any concentrations”

Are we then to accept Interdisciplinary concentrations like Chinese studies.
Environmental studies. Gendcrand Women's Studies and Lam American Studies
asdteonly measurementofthecollcge‘seommimrenttodiversitylntheeun-iculum?
Each ofthcseconcentmtronshasits ownfacultyadviser. Itistruerhatevery professor
should strive to include theexperienoes of people of color into dieircourses, but this

is not enough. Aﬁican American scholarship cannot be mixed into thecurriculum;
it must be integrated at the core,

Whatshoulddlsnnguish liberal anscolleges from all others islhcirwﬂlingness
to embrace, appreciate and celebrate all facets of human experience, theoretical
approaches, empirical and scientiﬁc inquiry. Is this Gnrmell?

I am not saying there hasn’t been some efforlon the part ofthe administration,
faculty and students. Whad am saying is what a wonderful opporuinity we have if
we practice what we preach! Students sincere about creating afunctional Aﬁ'ican
American Studies concentration should email President Fﬂguson, Charles Duke
and Helen Scott and ask them to hire a professor to teach an inuoduclory coulse in
this wncenl‘leon for the fall of 1995. Ask them: ”When can We register for the
course?"
