Collegium Musicum Will

 

Perfonn Excerpts from
Monteverdi's Opera "L'Orfeo"

Collegium Musicum, the period»inerumenl en—
semble at Grinneli College, will present a concert
of music by composer Claudio Monteverdi and
contemporaries at 8 pm. Sunday, Nov. 21, in
Herrick Chapel.

The concert will present excerpts from
Monteverdi's opera “L’Orfeo,” written in 1607.
“L‘Orfeo” follows the efforts of poclrsinger
Orpheusas heattempts to rescuchis stolen spouse,
Euridice, from the Underworld. Coliegium
Musicum also will perform medieval and Renais-
sance music that reﬂects Monteverdi’s musical
heritage,

Coilegium Musicumisdireeted byAssociale
Music Professor Elizabeth Hays, who was in~
volved in one of the firstAmerican productions of
“L’Orfeo,” as editor. harpsichordist and coach.
This semester she is teaching a Baroque music
course and a special tutorial “Great Mythic Tales
in Music,” both of which include students who
will be performing in concert.

Monteverdi, who lived from 1567 to 1643, is
credited with using musical dissonance for dra-
matic purposes and ushering in Baroque styles of
musical expression. Such use of dissonance also
set the stage for the development of opera.
