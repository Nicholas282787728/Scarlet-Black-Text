Tales From Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

If I’d not been raised in New York
City, Manhattan, would I still feel all
this world is full of strangers,
and ifI’d been graded from earliest
schooling would I know the truth of
education,
and if I'd not traveled around this
country and around this world would
I have thought all the world moves
to the same frantic beat of the city
and if I’d shut my eyes when the
police beat the boy who stole my
boots from the hard dirty Bangkok
streets would I believe in justice .
and ifI‘d closed my ears to the crack
of the whip and the pain filled cries
would I have recognized the beauty
of the monks wandering the same
streets in silent dignity ‘
and if my history teachers in high
school were not kind intelligent sor
cialists would I be aware of
America’s shame
and if we'd read Howl in English
class would I have worried about my
penis getting hard in the locker room
shower ‘
and if I’d Chosen Macalaster would
‘ Ihave graduated
and if the Challenger hadn't eke

Don’t Ask Me,

BY LIzz WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

To keep to my goal of isolating
myself from each and every group
on campus, thus creating a weekly
letter to the editor in my honor... This
week's GO TO HELL is especially
for the Concerts Committee.

So there’s all this hoopla about
who's going to be on the committee
to pick the next president of our fine
academic institution. Everyone (or
so it seems) wants another person or
two in on the selection. I agree.
There were three students the last
time and there should be at least three
now, espeCially considering how
close the race was last year. To make
it fair, add two more alumni and fac-
ulty. I have ideas of who these
alumni and faculty should be, but
that'sjusi because, like the trustees,
I have an agenda for Grinnell too.
Erin is a nice girl. However, I would
not consider her representative of
many students at Grinnell. Then
again I have my mix of people here
and, thus, my bias as to what repre
sentative means in the student body.
Maybe my friends stick out lnore
than others. Maybe they just stick
out to me. Nevertheless, I think that
we need more representation, The
selection ofthe President will affect
a hell ofa lot of Issues at this school
and I want my voice (or an echo of
my voice) heard. No, I don't want
to be on the committee.

Anyhoo, this is my suggestion...
One can be Erin, after all she is preSi»
dent. The next should be the diver-
slty/politicaliwhalcveryouwant-
iocallit student, The thild should be
representative of Grilinell‘s other
side. the side you don't see on ad-
missions brochures The side of de-

ploded would I still dream of space
and I‘d never given myselfto dreams
would my heart have remained un-
broken

and if I’d ncvcr read TIM Dlilll'llm
Bum: on the dark sad days followr
ing in the psychedelic apartment With
its dripping red walls and the smell
of doughnuts would I have known
to reach out to the outsiders, would I
have understood the purpose of my
voice

and if Roger Lasley never told me
that the school was more important
than the individuals it is composed
of, would I respect him

and if the administration hadn't llcd
so much would I trust them

and if my best friend hadn’t raped a
woman would I trust my understand
ing of souls

and if I'd never loved a woman
who‘d been raped would I dismiss it
as casually as numbers

and if I'd never loved a woman
would I hunger after sex

and ifI'd never seen a rainbow would
Ibelieve in lucky little leprechaun:
and ifJerry hadn't died would I have
ever gotten the message

and if Phish didn't annoy me would
I be a hippie profitecr

and if I‘d never had to pay for rent
would I have worked a forty hour
week

and ifI never asked questions would
I be a better American

and if I‘d never tried drugs would I
ask so many questions

and if I'd never lived to such excess
would I have ever known my limits
and if it were not this life I’ve lived
would I be certain of something?

I’m Just A Girl

bauchery and mcrriment that both
attracts and frightens people at, to,
and away from Grinnell, You know
who they are. You may be one. I
want astoner on the committee. And
I don't want a specially-selected,
SSA-appointed sloner that really is
actually some cute. preppy kid who
tried it once at a concert in (gasp!)

band while checking email iii Clcvc-
land. I want someone who is infa»
mous. Hell, we could even use one
of my friends that has been kicked,
ﬂunked. or otllerwise forced out of
Grinnell because they were constdv
ered some sort of “problem” to be
dealt with. Or maybe someone that
took six years to graduate. I'm sure
they have some ideas to share, I want
someone who celebrates each day at
four-twenty in the afternoon. lwzint
a stinky. patchoullirwcuring (or my
sibly sage), noodlerdancing, patch—
work-wearing, glassrcarrying hippie
that not only can tell you if the cam-
pus is dry but can also recite every
Panic setlist of the past tllree years.
Sure, they may forget to go to a
couple ofnieetings, but they will pro-
vide a perspective currently ignored
and downplayed at this college It
you disagree With me, why then, I
ask you, are the majority of students
in admissions brochures wearing let-
terjackcts, not taking bong hits, or
Carrying around whiskey bottles”
That’s all I have to say about that.
Waltz, on the contrary, is a subject
that never tires. Especially when
you're gossiping the morning after
at Quad. Waltz is the night when
even the good kids go to the hospital
for alcohol poisoning, Waltz is the
night everyone can get laid if they
find the right person in the right state
or mind Heh lich heh. I suggest
these pick up lilies (Sure they‘re
ui-lromantic, but at least you'll be
honest.)
“Hey, you look nice. Want to go back
to my place and make oul‘i”
“I'm drunk. Want to have sex with
me?"
“I've got a Brita iil lily room. You
look like you could use some watcrfv
“I don’t go here, Ijusi came to visit
my friend, _'

Have a good weekend and I'm off
like a Waltz dress...

OPINION

Technicolor Penguins

BY ERIN PETERSEN
Columnist

with just a wcck left ofclasses and
just two weeks before the end ofthe
semester, one would think that the
gencml mood on campus would be
boisterous, Instead, we all look like
the person featured in Munch’s painl-
ing, The Scream. There is only one
way I can account for this fact: the
research paper.

A research paper is much like the
Goodyear Blimp which looms over
a football stadium: while you can
ignore it most of the time, you can

never quite shake the sense that it
might fall out ofthe sky and kill you.
Professors optimistically assume that
we have been doing research all ser
mester, since they encouraged us in
the syllabus to be thinking of topics
and arguments since August, but
even they can’t ignore the stricken
faces when they blithely say things
like, “Writing 20 pages won't be your
problem. You should have more than
enough information." They don‘t
know that our only research thus far
has been a failed search on the Web
which culminated in leisurely read-
ing of the Jelly Belly home page.
Many people, especially
Grinnellians, rind research papers
disturbing. Although it IS convenient
because you don’t have to present
your own original argument, it is in-
convenient because it necessitates
telling actual facts, things that En-
glish majors like myself use spar-
ingly. They also require annotated
bibliographies, which are not a prob»
lem unless. like 95% of all students.

you do not actually read any of the
sources you cite, but instead lake
quotations directly froin the back
cover,

When the pressure gets too intense,
we often play jokes on our fellow
classmates. For instance, in my semi-
nar, I’ve been taking part in an in»
creasingly competitive and violent
activity known as the library book
recall game which involves complex
planning and the ability to think sev-
eral moves ahead of your opponent
(much like chess), The game consists
of strategically checking out books
so that when someone recalls them.
you can return them and recall thern
baekjust as they are about to do re-
search, Each day before class, some
one will inevitably storm into the
room shouting: “Who recalled every
single one of my sources?" Every
one will then stare solemnly into their
notebooks until someone begins gigr
gling uncontrollably, I suspect that
these incidents will soon escalate into
brawls”

5 .

While topics and page lengths may ,
vary, the actual process ofcreating a _‘.
research paper rarely deviates. About
three days before the paper is due the
ritual begins, which involves the fol-
lowing sequencc: Stake out com- .
puter. Buy coffee. Stack books and
other sources neatly in order of de
scendingsize or thickness. Stare at ‘ ‘
the screen for multiple consecutive
hours. Fret, Buy more coffee. Type
title page, Check email. Hate the
person next to you, who is listening
to techno on headphones at an un-
reasonably high decibel level. Hal- -
lucinate, Type whatever yoii can
think of until the page limit is
reached, Turn in and brag to your
friends about how this is the worst
paper you have ever written.

Fortunately, the process gets much
easier each year. when students disr L
cover the perfect mix of apathy and
last-minute panic. I am proud to say
that, as a senior, I have mastered the
process. I can only hope no one re-
calls my books.

 

Letters

Dear Campus Community,

We are writing to inform you of an
incident which recently took place on
our floor. A racial slur was written
on one of our message boards a few
weeks ago. This derogatory com-
meilt affected not only the person
whose board was written on, but the
ﬂoor as a whole. The message dis-
rtlpted the sense of security and mu-
tual respect which existed previously
on our floor. We want to call this
incident to your attention because it
not only affects our floor, but the
entire campus as well. We will not
tolerate this type of blatant racism
and hate, and we are shocked by the
possibility that a student may have
written this racial slur. In writing this

, letter, we hope to restore the sense
. or community and respect which

’Gri‘n‘nell College strives to promote.
These types of incidents can and do
happen at Grinnell and they should
not be ignored

Thank You,
Dibble 3rd

To the Editor,

I have been following with great
interest the articles and letters in your
paper concerning recent acts of van-
dalism in our community and the sig—
nificance you assign to these acts as
indications of the racism that exists
here. I would like to respond to some
ofthe issues that have been raised

I’m still not sure what to make of
the original article and some of the
statements made therein Editor»in-
Chief Hustings has written a front-
page article containing both factual
AND editorial material, then accom-
panied it with a shocking photograph
and caption referring to a “small. but
prominent" group of citizens as the
pcipeirators. One must assume that
the majority of S & B readers are
intelligent pcoplc capable of form-
ing tllcir own conclusmns ifallowcd
to read aliicles based on factual and
objective reporting. When you edi-
toriallze in the lnidsl of a so-called
“objective" piece, you deprive your
readers ofthcir right to make reasonr
able assumptions based on fact. Thzit
alone should give your readers pause.

The Editor’s use of the word
"prominent" in the stoiy should also
be cliusc for reader's concern.
Webster's New World Dictionary
contains two definitions relevant to
the Story, one refers to “prominent"
citizens as "easily identifiable"; the
othcl to people who are “respected
and admired". I guarantee you that
the people responsible for these
senseless acts are NOT respected and
admired by the vast majority of
Griiiticllinns. Now, if the ﬁrst defir
nliion applies and the perpetrators
ill‘c castly identiﬁable, than the Edir
tor should be writing a story about
how the people involved had been
caught and prosecuted rather than an
article blaming all ofGrinnell for its
failure to react Even through the
offenders have not been identifiedv
the Editor is already pointing fingers
tit our community as a whole. Iden-

to the Editor

tifying vandals, whether their acts are
racially motivated or not, is ex-

' tremely difficult at best. Thatis what
makes the use of vandalism and rar
cial slur so attractive to the morons
who engage in such activity. The
absolute Worst response to this lur
nacy is fear. Unfortunately. whether
it is intentional or not, fear seems to
be the emotion you choose to play
upon in the original article and in
your editorial.

MLE Davis attempted to point out
the lack of journalistic integrity in the
original article. Nowhere did she
suggest that the story should not have
been reported. She does suggest that
it should be reported on factually and
without the type of editoriallzation
that tends to polarize communities
rather than bring them together for
possible solution. Evan Wilcox ’97,
addresses these Journalistic issues
quite eloquently in his letter. Chian
Wu '00, by pointing out the need for
selfrexamination also makes an ex-
cellent point. I would suggest, how-
ever, that the entire community needs
to perform a selfaexamination - as
well as an examination of the facts ,
before reacting to highly stressful
and flammable situations. Ido think
it is amistake for Chian to single out
Frank Thomas '71, because of his
position (and perhaps, color) when
we all must bear responsibility for
what happens in Grinnell. Ihave
known Frank Thomas for 30 years
and am sure that he recognizes what
this community is about, warts and
all. Chian’s letter does, however,
encourage discourse rather than dia-
tribe. Unfortunately, the letter sub-
mitted by Hormuz Batliboi ‘00 en-
gages ONLY in diatribe. That is a
shame, because a truly serious issue
such as this which has justiﬁably
agitated Batliboi and others would be
best met With constructive dialogue
rather than Vitriol.

Finally. I would like to respond to
your editorial in the November 14th
S & B. Quite frankly, this editorial
bafﬂes me even more than the origi-
nal article. Whereas it is certainly
most appropriate for the editor to
express personal opinion as an edi-
torial, it is the opinion itself that de-
fies reason, Ignorance, Prejudice,
and Racism certainly do exist in this
community as in any community. It
doesn’t mean that it is acceptable to
the community as a whole. The re-
sponse from the City Council and the
Human Rights Commission (which
was reported with a fair degree of
journalistic integrity in the issue
dated November 21) is an example
of how ni05t people in our commu»
nity want to respond to racism, sex-
ism, vandalism, hooliganism and so
on. While the Editor many not have
said the citizens of Grinnell sup-
ported what happened she did sug—
gest that Grinellians, by their lack of
response, donii care. MLE Davis is
most certainly entitled to her opin-
ion concerning the severity or sig-
nificance of these incidents as they
relate to our community. Whether
you agree with her or not, she should
be able to express her opinion With-

out being attacked as someone who
tacitly supports racism,

The most alarming aspect of your
editorial remains the feamiongering.
Do you really think Grinnell is a
“harshly hostile environment"?
Then let me describe another cam-
pus to you. This campus is located
not far from here. Vandalism has
occurred to autos parked smack dab
in the middle of campus, Occasion—
ally, racist grafﬁti has appeared on
outside dorm walls, college build—
ings, and cars. Students must walk
in groups on campus as well as in
the immediate neighborhood because
assaults and muggings occur with
some regularity. Aftera certain hour
students are required to submit col-
lege ID's for entrance to all campus
facilities, including dorms. Each
don-n has a monitoring station open
24 hours a day where visitors MUST
have student lD's (or be accompa~
nied by a resident of that particular

dorm) and are required to check in,

and out. When students visit other
dorms, they must relinquish their
ID's until they leave. All of this is
done in the name of security. There
have been 4 murders within 1/2 block
of this campus in the last six years.
Even though it is a small campus
comparable in phySlcal size to
Grinnell, transit buses run even in
daylight from each building in order
to provide safety. When the student
newspaper reports on incidents of
muggings, vandalism. theft, etc. they
do so with strict adherence to a policy
of objectivity that leaves readers to
form their own opinions. Editorial
points ofview can often be found on
the editorial page where they belong.
Students and members of the sur-
rounding community recognize the
severity ofthe problem, but react to
it by trying to establish a dialogue
involving students, faculty, business
leaders, and community members.
Rather than hurl fear~bascd insults at
each other, everyone involved at
tempts to make the neighborhood
work through understanding. Every—
one involved recognizes racism and
knows that it is not representative of
the whole community Nobody is
expected to prove anything to any
body. My daughterlives on this came
pus but she (and her colleagues)
refuse to live in fear, They choose
instead to learn from each other and
react to each other’s differences with
civility and patience.

Fear must be lnet head on, no ex-
ceptions. When it is allowed to fes-
ter, no one gains but the people who
commit the sort oftrzinsgression that
happened here. When you fear these
morons, you give them exactly what
they want. When the Editor chooses
to capitalize on fear to make a point
itbecomcs reprehensible to me, Yes,
I believe these things have occuned
in Grinnell, and I am saddened that
the most easily identifiable students
seem to be singled out for harass-
ment. Just remember, many other
Grinnellians have experienced the
same type ofireatmcnt There were
thirty incidents ofvandalism in town
that night, yet that rated only brief
mention in your story, One family
even had their car torched that
evening, but their kids still go to
school and the family still comes
downtown, Thcy refuse to show fear,

and you shouldn‘t either, much less ,
allow editorialists to promote fear as

an appropriate response. As one per— .
son of color residing in this town
says, racism in Grinnell is based ale l"
most exclusively on ignorance, riot
malice. This person and his family
refuse to be fearful. While they are i
sometimes disappointed and even
outraged by community response to ' '
racial problems, they are not ready

to hole up in their home and hurl in-
sults at the outside world. We could
all learn from their strength and in-
tegrity.

Grinnell is not aperfect community . .
by any means. ButI submit to you
that problems rooted in ignorance
and fear will not go away it" citizens
of all types aren’t willing to talk to
each other with respect and patience.
As a local businessperson, I would
like to encourage all members of the
college community to come into
town for a visit. You are an integral '
part ofthis community, and you ARE
WELCOME HERE! L

Jeffrey L. Phelps ’71, Owner
