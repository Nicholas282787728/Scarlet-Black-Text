MAGILL : Minister's remarks spark controversy

really African at all.

He explained how the Native
Americans were convicts sent here
thousands of years ago from Asia.

All the lime the Minister ducked
criticism. He claimed they were not
his word. but those of the Koran. I
am reminded of White Suprema-
cist propaganda about how all uiey
say is really in Scripture. Like the
Nazis ofSO yearsago and the Nazis
of today he hid behind a mix of
religion and racist psudorscicnco.

Somehow. however. I have doubts
about his tmnslation of the Koran.
Seems strange that a book is stud
ied letter by letter for more then a
thousand years and it’sonly now all
these truths are revealed.

I know he has the right to speak
freely; I now take up my right to
respond. I respond notjust for my
self, but forlhose who were viliﬁed
before. and those who, if this man
gets his way. will surely be cmci-
Fred after. My hum however, is not
in the fact he spoke, or that my
money paid for him to deliver his
message of hate. We’ve all heard

insensitive despite the humorous
intent. The people who arranged
the symposium knew ofFarrakan‘s
hatred and yet they brought this
bigot anyway. will they say it was
only ajoke? I doubt it. Some will
claim that I am a racist or that the

nothing. To others can I can only

thoughtless emotional beating, In-

There's no better time to speak your mind, Because

only wonder what the Rosenlield
Office and theOfﬁceofMulti-Cul-
tural Affairs were thinking. In truth
I‘m not sure if I want to know.

I was often told as a child about
how of the first three people who
died in the name of civil rigth on a
Mississippi road, two of them were
Jewish. As a Jew I always took
great pride in this and held these
men up as examples of how Ishould
live my life. Now, 2151 sithere. I can
only wonder if their deaths were in
vain.
