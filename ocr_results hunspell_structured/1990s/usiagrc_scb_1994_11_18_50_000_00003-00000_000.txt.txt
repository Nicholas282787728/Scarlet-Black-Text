Lawrence, Otto GrossandFraanung.
In writing this book. Michaels
explained that she “didn‘t really en-
counter any problems beyond the
usual frustrations of writing. Doing
the research was easy since it was
easy to ﬁnd everything I needed—a
pleasantchangerromapreviousbook
where some of the materials were in
what was then the German Demo-
cratic Republic and ultimately im»
possible to see; I was physically
turned away from the archive!"

For further reading of Werfel,
Mlchaels listed two of her favorite
works: “The Forty Day: of Mum
Daghwhichdepictsthe'l‘urkishpersee
cutionoflheAnnenians,andCeIlawhich
depicts the Nazi takeover of Austria.”

Michaels eamed a master’s de-
gree from the University ofEdiriburgh
and master‘s and doctorate degrees
from MeGlll University. She has
been teaching at Grinnell since 1975.
