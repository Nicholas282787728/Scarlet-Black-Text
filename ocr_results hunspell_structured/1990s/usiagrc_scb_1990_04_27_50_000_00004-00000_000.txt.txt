Student Witnesses
Spearﬁshing

By Charlie Frago

Last weekend. I traveled to the
Lac do Flambcau Chippewa reser-
vation in northern Wisconsin as a
nonrviolent witness. I was to ob
serve what occured attitebontland-
ings and record any racial hostility
and/or criminal activity during the

‘ Chippewa spearfishing.

The Chippewa people of north-
cm Wisconsin ceded their lands to
the Us government in 1854 but
retained usufruct rights over the
game, timber and natural resources
of their former territory. For over
one hundred years these rights were
inhibited through tactics of intimr
tinuon, assimilation, and legal au-
thority. In 1983, however, the
Supreme Court reaffirmed the
Chippewa ueatynghts‘andset'saie,
enviromcntally sound limits for the
harvesting ofdeer,timbcr,andfish.

The most controversial issue
since 1983 has been the harvesting
of fish each April by the traditional
Chippewa method of speariishing.
Each spring has seen vocal and
often violent protests against the
spearing and theracial and cultural
tensions have risen dramatically.

Last year, the violence and rar
cism displayed at the boat landings
by protesters againstthe oeatyrights
recievcd national media attention.
This spring, the media has gener-
ally portrayed the atmosphere at
Iheboatlandingsasreiativcly calm,
while maintaining that the virulent
racism and violence of 1989 has
largely dissipated. After two nights
I can only conclude that the media
uses the word relative loosely.

On Friday night, I traveled to

eight spearers and their families.
We were met at the boat landing by
about 150 area police in full riot
gear. The ofﬁcers refused to speak
with us, stating that their policy
was to refrain from any discussion
with either side. Once the protest-
ers started to an‘ive, howver, these
same ofﬁcers carried on animated
conversations With them. Oncethe
spearers started to launch their
boats, the crowd of protesters im»
mediawa began a torrent of verbal
abuse. Shouts of “timber nigger."
and “drunk-ass, welfare Indians,"
and threats of physical violence

under heavy police escort.

The crowd of400 angry protest-
ers began to chant “One Nation"

and “Chippewa Rapists" as they
pushed towards the Chippewa
families. As the police stood by,

in order to protect the Chippewa
drum upon which a $1000 bounty
had been promised to whoever
destroyed it. As we linked arms
with our backs to the crowd and the
drummers began to sing traditional
reltgioussongs,theprotcstcrsblcw
whistles in an attempt l0 drown out
the sound of the drum.

At 11 pm mosr of the media
representatives went home, aftcr

one had been hurt. But the spcrtrcrs

intervening three hours were truly

rock hit the a boy. A man in the

As the AIM members pressed

a scufﬂe broke out, Although it
was unclear who started the fight,
police rushed in and apprehended
two AIMmen while the protesters
