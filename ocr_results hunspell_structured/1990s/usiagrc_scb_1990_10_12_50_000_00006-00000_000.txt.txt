Is the Quality of a
Grinnell Education
Lower this Year?

Though the college dropped in
ranking from mm to 16th in U.S
New: and World Report‘s recent
national college-ranking survey.
Grinnell should not be too
concerned

Because U.S. News changed its criteria from lastycar, the magazine
has made it impossible to compare the statistics from previous years with
any reasonable consistency. Quite simply, the frame of reference is not
the same. '

The college should not focus on the statistics ofa survey that may or
may not be indicative ofactual differences from yeartoyear. Dropping
six places in ranking does not necessarily indicate that the college has
proportionately deteriorated in some aspect We won’t suddenlyrealize
that our education has significantly worsened, because it hasn‘t. We
won‘t suddenly clutch our textbooks to our hearts and vow to do better
next year, because we haven’t somehow failed ourselves.

Factors can ﬂuctuate from year to year that may make it seem so,
however. For example, if another college suddenly increased its
endowment by inheritating a lot of money, its ratings would rise, if all
of its other criteria remained at least equal to the previous year.
Grinnell, at die same time, would fall ifils standardssimplyremained
level.

Also, while a drop in rankings may motivate the Powers That Be to
somehowimprove those standards that are considered lacking, it can also
needlessly increase pressure to conform to someone else‘s standards of
excellence. Too much concentration on statistics may cause people to
forget thatnot all qualities can be so mathematically calculated. Senseof
community, campus attitudes and other intangible factors inﬂuence
people’s respect for a particular college.

Numbers don't tell everything We need to focus on the real issues
of education,

Women's Soccer
Team Deserves
Enthusiastic Praise

The editorial staff of the Scarlet
and Black applauds the
achievements of the members of
the women's soccer team this
year. The Pioneer's record of 10-
0-1 isaciearindicatorof the team's
caliber, Also impressive are the margins by which the team has won,
often by a spread of several points.

What is even more ptaiseworthy is the relative infancy of varsity
women‘s soccer at Grinnell. Only five years ago, women’s soccer was a
club spon. Now it has grown intoa regional powerhouse. The team was
recently ranked fourth in the NCAA Division III Midwest region, an
incredible accomplishment considering the team has only been
“ofﬁcial" for four years. The Pioneers have a great opportunity to win
their conference and perhaps even qualify for nationals.

The Scarlet and Black wishes them luck in these endeavors and
recognizes their outstanding accomplishments in the past [our years.

SGA Creates Weekly Computer Poll

I made a campaign promise last
yeartocomputerizetheofﬁcialloint
Board agendaand minutes. That is
now areality. Also, MattStippich,
assistant treasurer, has created an
amazing program that not only
computerizes the agenda and
minutes, but provides an extensive
array ofoptions.

It far surpasses what I expected
to have available on the VAX.
It allows people to view this
week’s and the previous week’s
minutes, the agenda for the week,
lists each cabinet member's office
hours, lists the names of all the
cabinet members, the names of
all the senators and names of
members of all the SGA standing
committees.

It also has a menu option titled
“What‘s Happening" which
provides “general information,"
listsupcomiugevents,coucensand
movies and provides a note “from
thePresidcnt’sDesk."Theprogram
also gives the option of leaving
a comment on the program that
is COMPLETELY anonymous.
The anonymous board will allow
SGA to hear comments that
students mayordinarilybereluctanl
to tell their senators or cabinet
members.

Finally,oneortwopollquestions
will appear on the screen upon
exiting the program. The poll is
programmed such that each user
can only provide one answer until

the question changes.

The poll will allow SGA to tap
into campus sentiment on any
given question facing SGA. 1
envision using the poll questions
as a perfectly nice supplement to
initiative questions. in fact, if an
issue comes up that SGA has to
deal with and the next initiative
vote is far off, I can’t see why I
can‘t provide administrators with
a printout of the poll results and
expect them to treat it as if it were
an official campus vole.

To access this program, simply
type “@[SGA]SGA“ at the dollar
prompt after logging on to
AVAX; a menu will appear
providing the options that I listed
above. This program is one of
the most imponant things that
SGA will provide this year. Give
the board a try. It only requires a
minute.

If everybody replies to a poll
question once a week, SGA can
feel infinitely more comfortable
telling administrators that their
request is fully backed by student
support. A print-out of the poll
resullswiilpmvideuswithtangible
evidence of such support.

Thcweek'sagendaandminutes
provides access to the same
infomation that formerly was only
available to people who were
directly involved with SGA.

By the way, the poll question
starting today asks whether the

Pedro
Fernandez-
McCarthy

dorms should remain open for the
first weekend of Spring Break.
Currently, students must leave by
noon on Saturday and many feel
that after a week of midrsems and
anall-niglttemr two writing papers,
that students should be given more
time to pack, rest up and mentally
unwind before traveling.

Vice-president Deb Koa and I
meet with the College staff last
Friday, and I'm not too sure they
like the idea—it would mean that
two RA‘s would have to volunteer
to remain for that weekend. The
staff was also concerned that iflhis
weekend were conceded, that the
same would have to be done over
Winter Break—something for
which Koa and I said We would not
push, I vaguely remember some
concern being expressed about the
extraheating cost,andthatadining
hall would have to remain open.

More than a few students have
come to my ofﬁce this year asking
about this However, because the
staff seems to be so opposed to it, I
hesitate to push for it unless I am
sure thata lotofstudents want this
to happen. Please respond to the
poll.
