The bonfire is a ritual religious
celebration for the pagans who be»
lreve in making sacred space in any
location rather than celebrating in a
building. During the celebration
energy from rhe five elemenrs ofself.
pride. sex, passion and power were
called upon and channeled inro a
number oftokcns which rho partici—
panrs could iceep for supporr during
finals week. This celebration was
somewhat different than others in
that the elements were called in the
shape ofa star rather than the tradi—
tional circle, Such experimentation
is nothing new to the Grinnell PDC
however because, as Firewoman
srressed, rhe pagans here call on a
number of different belief systems
and are always interested in trying
new rhmgs.

The resulrs ofthe 1995 survey
of Gtinnell students onsexual safe—
ty habit has been released in the
post ofﬁce. “Safe Sex at Grinnell?”
wascompiledbyThad Lesiak,1<ent
McClelland, and Sylvia Thorson—
Smith and the members of the
Spring 1995 class enrrrled "Empir—
ical Methods of Research." The
57-questlon survey revealed rhar
40% of Grinnellstudents have po«
tentizilly exposed themselves to the
HIV virus through unprotected in—
tcrcoutse,while anadditiona130%
potentially exposed themselves
throughunprotectedomlsex, Only
about 26% of the sexually active
respondents reporred having ever
been tested for HIV, The survey
also linked the tendency forsexual
tiskrtaking to alcohol abuse. In all,
only about 30% of students consis<
tently practice abstinence or safe
sex. In conclusion, the authors of
the survey and analysis prescribed
rhar, in order ro inform people of
the risk of HIV, programs should
affirm that abstinence is the best
form of prevention. Recognizing
that most students do choose to
have sex, however, they recom-
mend that condoms be made even
more accessible by insralling more
condom machines or give RLC‘s
condoms to distribute.
