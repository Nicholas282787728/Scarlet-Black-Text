SK any Grinnellian what
their favorite TV show is
and you’re liable to get one

of the following responses: The
Simpi‘mlr.Melro:ePlace,BeverlyHilIi
90210, Star Trek, ER, or “I don't
watehTV." Those whowill admit that
they actually watch TV will tell you
that they are not alone. Gathering to
watchlhosefavoriteshowswtthfriends
and ﬂoorrnates is a common activitiy
on campus, whether students want to
admit it or not.

Mondaynighuat7:00p.m. groups
gather to watch Metrorc Place on Fox.
For these people Melrose has become
more than just a show, its a hobby.
Histories of characters are shared and
information swapped, previous plots
are regurgitated as they become rel»
evanttoactionsintheepisode playing.
Re-runs are a prime opponunity for
expounding viewing knowledge upon
the ignorant masses while pretending
to share with the characters on screen
rather than your neighbor.

“That'sright, butnot till she steals

Students watch shows for many
vaiying reasons. “Reruns make me
feel like I can predict the future," said
one Melroie viewer.

Freshman Collis Rost, avid Star

Trek fan, explained the appeal of his
favorite show. “It‘s on every night,"
he said. So is the key for student
pleasure regularity? Doubtful.

Senior Michele Stzluff has actu-
ally studied and written about the tele
vision groups. As a regular Beverly
Hills 90210 viewer, Stauff decided to
focus on the group that gathers in one
of the dorm lounges to watch the show

Coalition to provide forum for info, action

By TRISHA HOWELL

News Editor
TUDENTS have gathered to

form “The Coalition," origin

nally started as a group of
multicultural students who wished to
address multicultural issues. However,
the group has opened to all students
and Will work on other issues.

So far, no goals or projects have
been set for the Coalition. Rather, the
group has been deciding on basic is:
sues such as the structure and purpose
of the group. it was decided on
Wednesday, April 26, that the group
will be a forum for exchange and dis
cussion of information and ideas pre
sented by individuals. The Coalition
will also be able to lake action on
issues its members wish to address.

Patrick Curry, one of the initial
organizers of the group. said that one
advantageofthe Coalition is that itcan
be used to ”present a solid from."
“One person here and one person there
is not as noticeable," he said.

All decisions made conccming
the structure and purpose of the group
Wednesday night were made only at:
ter those present could come to ti con»
scnsus. Senior Aaron Gross proposed
this idea, explaining that “[w]hcn you

strength."

Deciding on the purpose of the
group was a main concern for mem-
bers, who did not wish to “step on the
toes" of groups such as ASIA. CBS
and MEC. There was concern that if
Coalition became a group which acted
on its own, "it [would add} one more
voice to the confusion." said freshman
Grady Murdock.

Regarding the formation ofthe the
Coalition, Siclinda CantyrElliot, As»
sistant Dean of Multicultural Affairs,
said that “if the students feel they have

a need, I don‘t take it negatively," She
felt that the students should form the
group it" they feel that there is a need
whlch it can meet

The Coalition should not be cone
fused with Ihc Diversity Coalition, with
which Canly-Elliot works. The Diverr
sity Coalition is a group often students
who have "expressed an intcrest in pro
monng dialogue"about multicultural is
sues, she said, The Diversity Coalition
members receive training, after which
they organize activities for the campus
and town communities.
