To the Editor:

I found an article in your Febru~
ary 12 issue extremely offensive. It
wasarticlcaboutthepublishing com-
pany wanting to censor parts of your
yearbook. The part of the article that
I found offensive was the last para
graph where it states, “Like any radii
cal Biblerthumping freak is going to
get ahold of the ’93 Cyclone and sue
the college anyway.”

I find it interesting that Grinnell
College claims to be open-minded
and accepting of all groups of people
and yet when it comes to someone
who believes in the Bible and stands
behind the morals and values taught
in it, we are freaks.

I happen to enjoy having many
students into my home. I never ask
them what they believe in or what
their sexual preference is: I simply
enjoy their company because of who
they are.

I always read the 5&3 and have
enjoyed looking at the yearbook. A
letterlike yours—so filled withanger
becauseyou can’talways have it your
way—offends me.

There are many others like me
who do see the things thatare written
for the publicat the college, We should

 

To the Editor:

be considered when the yearbook is

beingpublished.1sincerelyhope that

you will learn the true essence of
being open-minded.

An Open Letter to the
Christian Fellowship:

“Who, when he was reviled, rer
viled not again;” 71 Peter 2:22-23

Well,obviouslyIamnotaChrisr
tian, and sol do notfollow in Christ‘s
footsteps: I have been reviled and I
plan to revile back.

Sadly enough, despite Christ’s
teachings, which try to get his dis-
ciples to lead “a life free from sin,
hatred and unrighteousness,“ you
Christians haven’t yet teamed a very
important lesson. That lesson is tact.
Even understanding other points of
view seems beyond you.

In case you haven’t figured out
what has offended me so much, let
me quote you (oh, I’m sorry! The
Bible’s...) words right back at you.

“Therefore the Jews sought the
more to kill him, because he not only
had broken the Sabbath, butsaid also
thatGod was his father, making himr
self equal with God.” ilohn 5:18

I’m not writing this to debate
points of hiStory or theology; I’m
certainly not qualified to debate the
truth or untruth ofthrs statement. But

as someone who was called a “Christ
killer" as a child, I amjust telling you
that l, as a Jew, find this quotation
extremely offensive.

I would not want to deny you the
opuon of spreading the word of God,
in whatever guise you choose to do so.
I, personally, find thatstatement pretty
damn full of “sin, hatred and
unrightoousness," but, as] said before,
lam nota Christian, so I’m probably
not even qualiﬁed to debate that.

I simply believe that you were
(hopefully) ignorant of the comma
Lions oftheaforemcntioned Jew-bash-
ing,and r Ihoughtthatl’d send someof
yourChristianprosteletyzing rightback
at you, so maybe in the future you will
consider what you‘re sayin gwhen you
post shrt on the bathroom walls,

Of course, it's always possible
that you meant to be offensive, in

Non-smokershearmegwhile I admire your healthy

While distantin person, I find myselfithrough the
kind forwarding by the Off Campus Studies Office of
several issues of the 5&Bistill close in spirit to my
Alma Mater, Grinnell.Thus I am distressed to hearofthe
possibility of a smoke-free Bob‘s.

As a smoker, naturally the idea ofa smokeless Bob's
both won'ies and alarms me. I still remember clearly what
joy I felt at the opening of Bob’s; ﬁnally, a place where I
could sit anddrinkand smoke and bepretentious. Quickly
was the possibility of drinking (alcohol I mean, son)
removed, which still left me my smoking and posing.

Now though, with this dreadful initiative, 1 am left
with seemingly only my pompous attitude for a diver-
sion, and I think that many would share my disappointr
ment at the prospects of such a situation.

'l'hus,lwouldliketoexhort my non-smoking friends
toconsider my position; residing in Berlin for a semester
I am of course often diverted into the many cafes here.
People smoke. People drink. Trying to absorb the native
culture,1join them, becoming, sadly enough, an addict.

Now picture with me, reader, the future: I return to
Grinnell, which really only has one cafe, Bob’s. Already
deprived of the wonderful German beer I have grown to
love, I light up to soothe my nerves. Byron Johnson walks
over to me and tells me to put it out. Naturally I snap and
disembowel poor Byron, who is only trying to do his job,
thus leading to even more restrictions at Bob’s.

ful, vigorous ways, as an unhealthy, theaterrtype person
lwouldlend yourattention totheconcept of atmosphere;
a cafe without smoke is like a truck stop without large,
bearded, sleep-deprived men. I would point out that
glamorous people like Marlene Dietrich, Franklin
Roosevelt and Walter Raleigh all smoked (Marlene
living to the ripe old age of 94.) .

Andastoyourcomplaintsaboutsocondhandsmoke,
I would first point out how many healthy, non—smoking
people die in household accidents, car wrecks, murders,
etc, every year, thus making the whole issue of lung
cancerirrelevant; and second, I would wish toencourage
solidarity with our coalrmining bretheren who would
surely appreciate your passive efforts.

Thus, I hope that at least part of Bob’s will always
remainsmoke-filled (and screw this ‘Special Events No-
Smoking bullshit anyway) so that my return may be
made a little less traumatic.

From the Editor:

As reported in the February 12 issue of the 5&3,
Bob’s new smoking policy does not make it entirely
smoke-free. Smoking is still unrestricted west of the
center posts. During special events and public perforr
mances, however, there is no smoking in Bob’s.

tent to speak with you about it in

bit of Bible~speak wasn’t even im

To the Editor:

There is a rumor going around
campus that professor Keith
Fitzgerald of the political science
departmentdidn’tgettcnurc this year.
Hearing that made me wonder a
couple of things:

First,whywoult‘ln’tareallygreat
professor get tenure if teaching is
supposedly the most imponant con-
sideration?

Second, why do students have to
hearaboutthis through rumor? Why is
not this sort of newsireal, true, im
portant news—covered in the 5&3?

lknowthcadminisuation won't
talk about these decisions, but it still
seemslikestudcntscouldbeinformed
of them anyway. I don't even know
who else did or didn’tget tenure this
year.Istheresomeoneelsewcshould
know about’.7

Couldn’t students at least corny
municate with oncanothcr about this
sort of stuff? I’d like to hear what
odterstudentsthinkaboutthesedeci-
sions.I’rllikctoknowifothersagrcc
with me that the SEPC reviews are a
joke and that students don’t really
have input into tenure decisions.

And I’d like to know if there’s
anything students can do to appeal a
decision. Everyone got all excited
about the Pip Gordon casciand that
was a good thing. But what about

Fitzgerald? Is there anything we can
do there?

Idon’t expect the 5&3 to cham-
pion Fitzgerald’s cause. I'd just like
to have a forum where students can
air their feelings about these tenure
cases. I’m tired of having good profs
just disappear and everyone being
really creepy about not discussing it.
I feel like we’re in Argentina or the
oldSovietUnion.Why hasFrtzgerald
been sent to academic Siberia? What
did he do wrong’.7

Last time I looked, students were
paying a lot of the bills around here.
Don’twehave somesay in who works
here with us?,

Inquiring minds want to know.

To the Editor:

This is a letter to explain the
events which occurred at the recepr
tion of Mr. William F. Buckley in
South Lounge on Monday, May 12.
The incident occurred as follows:

I went to the reception to trsk Mr.
Buckley 3 question. Mr. Buckley had
moved to the center of the room, and
as] was walking towards him, rt man
about my age in a suitand tie put his
elbow in my abdomen, blocking my
path. Assuming it was an accident, I
politely said, “Oh, I'm sorry,” and
started to go around him on his left
side. He then pushed me in a circle
around Mr. Buckley, keeping his el-
bow in my abdomen [or about ten
feet. Let me explain that this was a
conscious, unprovoked act of bullyr
ing and implied violence.

As I realized thathis intent was to
keep me, a rather nonnallyrdressed
college student, from speaking to Mr.
Buckley,l began to ask him questions.
Summarized, I said, “I am an Amerir
can citizen. Don’tyou believe that the
First Amendment of the Constitution
protects therights offreedom of speech
and freedom to peaceably assemble?
