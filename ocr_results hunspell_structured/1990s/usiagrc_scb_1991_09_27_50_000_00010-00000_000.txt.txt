for the Constitution, let our criticism
be tempered by the knowledge that he
washelpingNicaraguans in astruggle
to establish a society like the one

hands all the time. Although, for me
personally, this would bequite excel-
lent, I’m looking for diversity and
tolerance on every level. There are
some nights when I don’t want to
“shake my booty": I wanna tap my
foot to some quietacoustic music. 0r
sway back and forth to some reggae
or blues. Or maybejust stomp up and
down and mosh a wee bit,

I'II close this with a quote from

SuicidalTendencies:“Iust‘causeyou,
don’t like it, don’t mean it ain't no
good." Lookpast the stinky grammar“
and try to understand. And when you
hit the High Street Hocdown tonight
don‘ twalk out on the ﬁrst non dance
song you hear. *(Special thanks to

FORD: On the irrelevance

of September

continued from page 7

2030, with only two and a halfycars
on the federal bench as experience.
and with no clear indication of his
legal opinions on the right to privacy,
reproductive rights orcivil rights. On
the last item he seems grateful for the
opportunities it has provided him but
seems inclined to deny those oppDrr
tunIt'Ies to others.

Included in this September‘s high
points was last week‘s drama con-
cerning the possible redeployment of
warplanes to the MiddlcEasItosearch
forSaddam Hussein’shidden nuclear
weapons.The threatened and quickly
derescalated action seemed to punc-
tuate a new poll which claimed that
most Americans think that President
Bush spends too much time on for
eignaffairs. In all fairness to theprcsir
dent, he does spend time on domestic
affairs. lust last week he went to the
Grand Canyon to remind us that he is
still the Environmental President. I’m

convinced: how about you‘7

There IS one good thing to be said
abouISeptcmber. lt only has 30 days. -
Thirty-one days and something prer‘
apocalyptic could happen, like the
admission by Conservatives that?
multiculturalism might not be the.
singlebiggestthreattohumanitysince
Hitler wandered into Poland. I for
one, can I say whcum it is or isn ’,t~
because no one on campus seemsg
readytodefinc whatmulticulturalism
at Grinnell will mean. I’m tired of‘
hearing of what awful things itdid at.
Stanford. Grinnell has as much in
common with Stanford as I do with‘
William F. Buckley. Questions to be.
asked: Does this mean more intema-A
tional and minority students? The
destruction of Humanities 101? A4
foreign language requirement? More,
attention paid to minorities and
women In general survey classes?‘
I‘m waiting for specifics, and I sup-x
pose that as long as September enr
dures, I'll continue to wait. ‘
