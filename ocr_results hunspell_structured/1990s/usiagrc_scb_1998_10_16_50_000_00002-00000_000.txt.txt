“Rico Suave" "99 also made a

wieh Suerals synopsis. Says Suave,
“Yeah, we aceually srarred in ehe

Suave seaees rhae he was “gceeing

“Sonny" '01 and “Cher" "01 have

Campus responds lo alcohol and drug policy

BY MATT SWESSINGER
SmfFertcr

crinnellians, seudenrs, faculry,
and oeherwise, are well aware ofrhe
school’s self-governance policy rc—
garding alcohol and drug use. Hows
ever, ehe school’s ofﬁcial drug and
alcohol policy srares rhae underage
drinking and drug use of any form
are sericely prohibieed, ls ehis policy
fair?

Are drugs and alcohol used rcr
sponsibly or abused or Grinncll?

Tom crady, Vice—President and
Dean ofSeudenrAffairs for ehe Col»
legc said, “orinnell Colleges currene
drug and alcohol policy was implo
menecd in 1988 in response eo ehe
federal governmenrs raise on ehe
drinking age." The policy basically
seaees rhae ehough ehe college “im.
poses as few rules as possible on irs

enforce srarc and federal drug and
alcohol laws.

However, some seudenrs feel
rhae Sclfcgovcmancc is seill ehe
prevailing docerine. Sarah Shafer
‘01 said, “ Basically, if someone
gees caughrsmoking marijuana or
drinking underage, he or she is
rold eo stop. ir"s one really con»
sidercd a big deal."

Nicholas Rains ‘00 said rhae he
believes rhae ehe policy shows a
lack of reuse for seudenrs on pare
ofrheadminisrrarion. Rains said,
“i ehink ie's sad eliae ehe adminis-
eraeinn has no regard for any in—
srirueion ourside ofirself."

Crady explained, “Srudcnrs are
usually warned for eheir firse

Presidene ehis year, i have nor had
eime eo educaee myself aboue ehe
prevalence of or policy regarding
drug and alcohol use. of course i
am opposed to drug use, underage
drinking and drinking ro excess

Deb Sondall oo believes rhae
abuse, especially wieh alcohol is all
me corninon ae Grinnell: “l ehink
rhae ehere is a problem when people
are drinking ro excess insread of as
a social aceiviey."

Moses Mason "99 said, “i done

riced ehar alcohol is usually abused

borh Rains and Shafcr believe
ehar drugs and alcohol are generally

Rains said rhae seudenrs are al.

is primarily for research value, The
main abuse rhae I see is from minors

Rains

Ew‘n ar Grinnell, evidenely, alco—
