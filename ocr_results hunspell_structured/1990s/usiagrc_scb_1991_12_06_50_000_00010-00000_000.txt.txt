MORAN: When yo

need a light

continued from page 7

There’salimitto how much safety
any governing body can mandate for
its constituents without necessitating
a rebellion. So the administration takes
away our candles, maybe even our
incense— what‘s next? Is it time to
dress the Grinnell Pioneer in a bulky
costume of Teﬂon and polyurethane
and give him a ﬁre extinguisher to
tote around like a papoose?

To be honest, I don‘t give two
heels in hell as to whether or not they
pass the candle resolution, as long as
nobody complains about the way I
roast marshmallows and cocktail
wieners over my kerosenelantem. As

long as I can light stogies off the bum—
ers on the electric stove downstairs in
the kitchen and warm my hands over
that raging fire in the Dibble Lounge
fireplace, the lack of candles on my
birthday cake won’tbum meout. Nah,
I'll just kick back and thank the pow-
ers that be for delivering me from the
grim specter of dorm fires, The safe
life is the good life, and without
candles, worries evaporate and the
warm glow of security sets in,just like
on the Titanic. Life on campus could
be absolutely peachy, if the adminis-
u-ation would just pass another pro~
posal to get those boneheads on sec-
ond floor to stop lighting farts.

HETEROSEXIST: Survey
ignored lesbigay issues

continued from page 6

Affairs denies the validity of any
sexual orientation other than hetero-
sexuality. Student Affairs further de-
nies the validity of lesbigays by ask-
ing us aboutthe drinkinghabitsof our
mother and our father. which assumes
that all of us have grown up in “tradi-
tional“ heterosexual families, If the
Ofﬁce of Student Affairs is indeed
concerned about iheissue of dmg and
alcohol use and abuse on campus
then the surveys that they distribute
should take into account those of us

who are not heterosexual, or who did
not grow up in heterosexual house-
holds.

personally consider to be necessary
for my own life.

Grinnell also prepared me well to
cnteranoLherCulturegenLly,wilhscn~
silivity, and so now I find myself in
Russia for a stay of one year. Living
in Russia, I've become even more
convinced how subjective people's
interpretations of “necessary knowl-
edge" are. What some ofmy Russian
friends considernecessary knowledge
couldn’t interest me less.

I think Grinnell gave me the self-
confidence and awareness to be able
to learn selectively that which genur
inely interests me at the moment and
to pass over that which doesn‘t with-
out feeling deep regret, guilt or emf
barrassment for allowing those gaps
in my knowledge to exist.

Grinnell walked me through apar-
tial cross-section of the complexity of
the world and led me to appreciate its
vast dimensions. But more impor-

tant, Grinncll made me aware that
only a fraction of the world's comr
plexity can be taken in by any single
human mind. Finding that out was a
great comfort to me: before coming
to Grinncll, I naively assumed I was
obligated to take on the whole world.
Consequently, the complexity of the
world was severely taxing me, bum~
ing me out.

After Grinnell, the complexity of
the world still blows me away a bit,
butat least now I feel I can deal with
it better. Grinncll helped me to feel
comfortable with that cliche saying,
“The more you know, the less you
know.”

It was a seminar on Tolstoy my
senior year atGrinnell thatsuggested
to me this philosophy. Tolstoy wrote
a story about a man given the oppor-
tunity to acquire all the land that he
could encircle on foot between dawn
anddusk, In his greed, the man failsto
draw the circle to a close before sun-
set, dying in exhaustion along the

u JOURNAL: Graduate explores Russia‘

way. And so it turns out that the only
area of land he needs is a small plot'
for his grave. .
i realize it’s a great luxury to be
ablcto explorewithoutencirclingand’
to be able to define your own ‘ncces -«
sary knowledge rather than allow-
ing others to deﬁne it for you, Bull
feel Grinnell prepared me well to dot
both ofthosc things, and it did so nol,
without reason. For if we all were
simply to go the way ofencircling for‘
the sake of encircling, of acquiring,
knowledge that others value but that
holds little personal interest for us,‘
then sometime between dawn and.
dusk we. too, will collapse from ex-A
haustion, never having explored the
contours of the land that most interr‘
ests us. _

Q: Do you have any advice for’
the class of 1992? a

A: As much and as often as pos-
sible, let exploration take precedence‘
over encircling.

through seventeen, though, respec-
tively ask, “How frequently do you
consumebeer,winc,arid hardliquor?"
Consume instead of ure? These ques-
tions are all of a similar nature and
should, as such, be worded consis—
tently. The questioner is making a
distinction between alcohol and other
drugs which undermines the accur
racy of the survey.

The most distressing aspect of the
survey is the disproportionate num-
ber of questions concerning alcohol
as opposed to other drugs. Of the
fifteen questions pertaining to
“drugs." specific drugs such as mari-
juana are never mentioned in more
than ONE question, while there are
FIFTY questions pertaining to alco
hol, also a drug.

I infer, from the relative lack of
questions concerning specific dmgs,
that Student Affairs is paying lip»

service to the issue of non-alcoholic
drugs on campus. The idea that dnig ‘
users welfare is of less importancea
than the welfare of others is appall-
ing. Whenltelephoncd Ms. Jennifer
Krohn Associate Dean of Student"
Affairs, on Dccember3 toexpress my ‘
concerns she mentioned that drug use
is less visible now than when she was ‘
in college. However, less visibility .
may not mean less use, or that the
Significance of drug use should be ’
minimized.

Student Affairs makes assump-
tions based on what they want to hear
and what they want to deal with, as )1
their survey illustrates. But surveys ‘
are intended to provide data from
which accurate, logical conclusions A
may be drawn—and no such conclu-
sions may be drawn from this survey.
