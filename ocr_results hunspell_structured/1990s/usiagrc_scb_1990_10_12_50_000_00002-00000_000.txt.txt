By Craig Wacker

Todiscussadocumentoutlining
a plan for the strengthening of
Grinnell's multicultural commu-
nity, the college will sponsor an
Open Forum at 4:15 pm. on Fri-
day, Nov. 2. The alumni who

once will participate.

The goals ofthis plan cover the
acquisition of more minority fac-
ulty and staff over the next five
years. Grinnell presently has nine

minority faculty members and six
staff members. The plan suggests
that these numbers should be
doubled over the next five years.
Also targeted is Grinnell’s mi-
nority student population. Curr
rently,GrinnellincludesﬁOAfrican
Americans, 20 Latino Americans,
75 Asian Americans and one Nay
tive American. During the next
five years, these numbers should
increase to at least 100 African
Americans, 50 LatinoAmericans,

What Goings questions is
whether the police had the right to
enter the room through the win
dow. According to Lamb, this was
correct providing that the officers
had juslcauseinsearehinglheroom.
For this reason, Goings plans to
fight the charge.

Goings also mentioned that stu-
dent affairs hatl not contacted her
abouttheincident. Goingsthought
that it was ridiculous to leave an
HAC alone to deal with this. Go-
ings thanked her RA and dorm for
support throughout the ordeal.
