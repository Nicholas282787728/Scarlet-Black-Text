Letters Cont.

Unbeknownst to many Grinnellians,
there has already been one docu-
mented water balloon injury.

The administration has modiﬁed its
position on throwing water balloons
zit registration, They will now SUS»
PEND anyone caught throwing bal-
loons at registration. Water balloon
throwing will no longer be tolerated.

We, like most students, did not like
getting hit with water balloons at reg»
istration It is not fun and not funny.
Therefore, we invite all ofyou tojoin
us in better respecting first year stu-
dents next year, In sum, do not throw
water balloons anymore,

Dear MLE Davis,

This letter is in response to your
letter in the Scarlet and Black last
week, where you displayed your
foolishness and ignorance about the
incident of vandalism to some cars
and the racial insults spray painted
on the car. You claim that “thejump
to inflate its importance ..... reﬂects
poorly on the editor of the paper, the
paper itself, and the entire college
community". I ask you why we
should not be informed of such seri-
ous offences? When “die nigger" is
written on a student’s car, we, as stu-
dents at the college, have a RIGHT
to know of it. ‘When such bigoted
sentiments and hatred are expressed
by a certain group ofpeople in town,
we should be concerned for our
safety and for the ideal of open-
mindedness and tolerance. I don’t
think the Scarlet and Black “inﬂated"
the importance of the issue nor do I
believe it was wrong to have con-
nected the incident to town senti»
merit. Obviously, there are people
in the town who feel this way and
have made such feelings very clear.
Obviously, we need to sit up and take
notice ofthis incident, not apologize
to the town for attending an instiru»
tion such as Grinnell College, as you
do. Besides, I object to your claim»
ing that such articles make you
and me look like a couple of

asshole?» I certainly don’t think I:

look like an asshole, so ifyou’re try-
ing to tell the rest of us how YOU
feel, please speak for yourself, not
for the rest of us.

The 38:13 made itself quite clear
when it said that “the racist grafﬁti
is an example of the animosity a
small but prominent portion of the
town directs towards the college"
was an OPINION expressed by a stu-
dent. trail to understand why you
claim that this quote reflects on all
our opinions, when it is clearly the
personal opinion of a student, You
ask “what is small but prominent?”
I'll tell you what “small but promie
nent" is -that group of people who
go about vandalizing cars and dis-
playing their intolerance for people
of other races; “small but promi»
nent" includes those people who we
(students of color) DON‘T want to
meet when we're out alone at night;
“small but prominent" are those
people whose expression ofsuch ha-
tred and animosity makes me feel
unsafe and insecure when I go into
town, who stare at me with looks that
judge me because ofthe color of my
skin, who talk to me slowly and
loudly bccnuse they assume that be»
cause I‘m not white, I must not un-
derstand English easily. That‘s my
definition of“small but prominent”—
and these people are prominent be»
cause their views could easily pass
on to others and because they make
students of color feel uneasy about
being at Grinnell, even though we
students ofcolor pay as much money
as other students to be here and put
in as much time and effort into our

academic and extra~curricular work
as any other student.

MLE DZtVlS, you say that in your
opinion “..we are lucky to attend a
college in a town like this one." Yes,
I agree with you that Grinnell Col-
lege is one of the more prestigious
institutions in the nation and does
reward the intellectual and academic
efforts of its students. But does this
town value and respect the college
and its students?? Does the town
appreciate how lucky it is to have a
college like Grinnell inits midst7?
Certainly not! The college brings
students of color to Grinnell in an
effort to show its commitment to di-
versity, but does NOTHING to make
students of color feel comfortable in
this town, We students of color are
brought here to be displayed by the
college as artifacts in a celebration
of cultures,‘ An example of this in»
difference to its students of color is
reﬂected by the amount of time the
college has taken to commit to build»
ing the multircullural space center
(something the college has not yet
committed to building). We are ex»
pected to organize events such as
“Black History Month", ASIA food
bazaar, ISO food bazaar or "National
Hispanic Month" yet are denied the
facilities and space to efﬁciently or—
ganize such activities. As a cabinet
member of the International Stu»
dents‘ Organization, I know how
stressful and difﬁcult it is to orga-
nize events when we do not have
adequate space to do so; and I also
know that I am just a statistic on this
campus - one of the “10% interna-
tional student body" that the college
so effortlessly advertises in its
Viewbook. Yet, when incidents such
as this blatantly racist attack occurs,
1 don’t see the administration take an
active stand and do something about
such sentiments being expressed to-
wards the African-American stu-
dents. How come the administration
did not inform us of this incident in-
stead of a student publication telling
us about this one week later? How
come we hear of no follow-up on this
incident nor does the college tell us
how it plans to prosecute charges?
Does the college not want to offend
the town community by protecting
its students of color?

You say that we should lry walk;
ing into town and checking out the
community that surrounds your
bubble". I ask of you to walk into
the town and check out the commu-
nity that surrounds MY BUBBLE,
mine as a person of color. I am
shocked that a student at Grinnell
would express such apathy, indiffer-
ence and ignorance towards such an

, issue, 1 am shocked that you repri—

mand the editor of the Scarlet and
Black for bringing this incident to our
attention. I ask of you to check out
the college that surrounds YOUR
ISOLATED BUBBLE,

To the editor:

There are two issues here: foolish
opinions and journalistic standards.
The first is inescapable; everybody
has them, even newspaper editors.
The second is a protection from the
first, so that readers are given the
chance to make up their own minds
about the world around them.

The idea that nonecollege
Griiinellians bear animosity towards
this school is a remarkably foolish
belief, not to mention naive, egotis-
tical, paranoid, and insulting. For
most Grinnellians, the college is a
purely economic proposition. It is
not the most important entity in town,
but it does bring in a lot of money.
For those town residents whose oc-
cupations bring them into regular
contact with students, the relation-
ship is more complicated, but cerv
tainly not antagonistic. And, yes, for
a few residents - generally those

Operation AI 0 Sean McGinty

drunk, bored, or young enough to
bother - the college and its students
provide easy targets for invective and
harassment, Stupid kids with base—
ball bats and spray paint are the same
all over. They have their own col-
lections of foolish opinions.

That said, the Scarlet & Black‘s
coverage of recent vandalism (“Doz-
ens of automobiles vandalized," Nov,
7) and the subsequent editorial (“Ra-
cial Slurs Should Not Be Taken
Lightly,“ Nov. lgt) were failures of
journalism which, also, should not be
taken lightly. The ﬁrst article, as
MLE Davis pointed out, made no
pretense of objectivity, and given that
I, MLE, and everyone I’ve talked to
in town got the same message from
it makes Erin Hustings’ claim to have
“in no way suggested" that the town
supported the vandals utterly spe-
cious. Besides, why would they sup
port the crime when, for the most
part, it was non»college vehicles
which were damaged (a fact ignored
by the S 8; B)?

Had Hustings kept to the facts in
her article, and then penned an edi-
torial linking the crime to town sen-
timent, I would probably still be writ-
ing this letter - but I‘d have less to
complain about. As for the editorial
response to MLE's letter last week:
no, of course racism should‘not be
downplayed, but neither should this
incident be inﬂated or used to blind
readers to MLE's objections. No-
where in her letter does MLE sug-
gest that the crime was an unfit sub-
ject for lead-story treatment: this “re-
sponse" is more of a free»association
exercise. '

Please don‘t get me wrong: anti-rac-
ism is a sterling sentiment, but in this
case it is used to avoid other issues.
Hustings’ feelings on the topic and
her interpretation of the vandalism
may explain why the original news
article came out the way it did, but
that does not excuse the lapse. Nor
does it make Hustings’ characteriza-
tion of Grinnell as a harshly hostile
environment and her decision to pub-
lish an editorial response to MLE’s
letter in the same issue that the letter
appears in any more forgivable.
Foolish opinions are one thing, and
can be debated. Misuse of editorial
power and failure of journalistic in-

, tegrity, are quite another.

To the Grinnell Community:

Imagine the worstjob you’ve ever
worked. Long hours, rude bosses.
slave wages, and no bathroom
breaks. That's ajob most of us would
quit.

Unfortunately, some people don‘t
have that freedom.

The Strawberry Workers in Califor»
nia work 10»12 hour days in the blaz-
ing sun. They stoop over chemical-
saturated ﬁelds, doing literally back-
breaking work for $8,000 a year, On
the job there is no running water or
bathrooms. After work they go home
to broken»down shacks, cars, or even
caves, 'which house up to six family
members, Adding insult to injury,
the workers are kept from unioniz-
ing by crude scare<tactics by the
growers and even physical abuse,
resulting in the hospitalization of two
union organizers, Child labor laws
are routinely violated. Workers
handle cancer»causing pesticides on
a daily basis yet are denied any medi-
cal coverage. Women workers have
been subject to sexual harassment by
their managers.

Meanwhile, the corporate cooler
companies tum a blind eye to these
injustices, content to reap the ben»
efits ofa booming strawberry indus»
try.

These workers deserve better, Our
campus can make a difference.

What can we do to help? In soli»

ers and the AFL-CIO, we can sup»

port the strawberry workers’ right to
organize and fight for their basic
human needs,

This past Wednesday. a group of
concerned students presented the
workers’ struggle to the dining ser-
vice committee in the form ofa na-
tional pledge of support. The pledge
does not call for a boycott. It voices
support for workers‘ living wage,
proper ﬁeld sanitation, job security.
health insurance, and an end to
sexual harassment and other abuses.
The dining services committee re-
sponded to the pledge favorably. The
decision to sign the pledge will be
ofﬁcially addressed at the next meet»
ing on Dec. 3.

The pledge is a ﬁrst step to send the
messages to the strawberry growers
that we will not except this gross
exploitation of our fellow Ameri»
cans.

Keep your eyes open for the con-
tinuing status ofthe pledge and vax

Dear Editor,

One cannot help but notice the rash
of emails and signs proclaiming that
the student body is underrepresented
on the Presidential Selection Com-
mittee. Some students seem to feel
that we need one more person on the
committee to really represent all of
campus, As a senior, and an SGA
Cabinet member, it pains me to see
such extreme opinions based on mis-
guided assumptions. Ido not believe
that one person is incapable of rep-
resenting the views of most people
on campus. 0n the contrary, I think
that Erin Childress, who was elected
by the student body to represent our
views to the administration and the
trustees, has shown tremendous in-
terest in getting student input on the
selection process.

First, Erin invited Alceste Pappas,
the consultant hired by the trustees
to help them learn the opinions of
faculty, students, and staff, to Joint
Board. She also invited the entire stu-
dent body to attend this meeting in
order to facilitate the communication
of students’ wishes and concerns to
the trustees. g

. - At this meeting, we brainstormed

ways to give students as many av-
enues as possible to have our opin-
ions heard. Nobody at that meeting
wanted to keep students from ex-
pressing ourselves.

Second, Erin has promised to make
the minutes of each selection com-
mittee meeting available to campus.
Many other suggestions on how to
make the selection process more
open to student scrutiny were raised
at Wednesday's I oint Board meeting
Erin‘s goal is to end the secrecy that
surrounds decisions made by the
trustees.

I am concerned that attempting to
ﬁnd another student to serve on the
committee will undermine the rep»
resentation we already have. If the
committee members perceive a lack
of trust on the part of students toward
their own representative, the com-
mittee members will be less willing
to accept her as a credible voice of
students. This may not be so harm-
ful if more students are allowed into
the committee, but since the likeli-
hood of that happening is low, I fear
we are shooting ourselves in the foot.
Our efforts would be better spent dis-
cussing what we want from our new
president and our administration
amongst our friends, within our
group meetings, and with our repre-
sentative on the committee. We
should make sure that each student
has a chance to voice her or his opin-
ions to the committee, instead of
wasting our time with divisive acts.

OPINION

Dear Dr. BallantinE,

We are a group of concerned stu-
dents who have organized in an ef-
fort to convey the need for increased

student representation on the Presi- '

dential Search Committee,

As you are undoubtedly aware. the
current makeup of the committee
limits student representation to one
student, namely SGA President Erin
Childress. While them is little doubt
that Erin adequately represents those
who elected her, the circumstances
of her election must be taken into
account, We call on the Trustees to
consider this context, just as the
Trustees have asked students to con-
sider the context surrounding issues
such as space, the college's Afﬁrma-
tive Action policy, and diversity ini-
tiatives. The choices facing the stue
dent body in the SGA Presidential
election last spring were diametri-
cally opposed. Erin's platform of
preserving the status quo in SGA and
in relations with the administration
was in stark contrast to her
opponent‘s call for a massive over-
haul of both student government and
the administration’s approach to the
students. In the end Erin was elected
by a mere seventeen votes. Given
the narrow margin of victory and the
stark contrast of the candidates'
views, it is obvious that a signiﬁcant
portion of the student body did not
feel represented by SGA. Beyond
these issues of representation lies
organizational precedent.

Given that Grinnell‘s last Presiden-
tial search allowed for three student
representatives, the current set-up
seems to violate proper procedure.
While we have been informed of the
need to streamline the process, we
believe that reducing student repre~
sentation is an unacceptable solution.

In light of Grinnell‘s professed
commitment to self-govemance and
the fact that students are the clear
majority that will be affected by a
new president, it seems evident that
increased student representation is
warranted.

When one considers these issues
within the context of the college’s
commitment to diversity it is obvi-
ous that a move to expand student
representati n to include minority
viewpoints is imperative.

As students have communicated to
the board through Dr, Pappas, minor-
ity views need to be better expressed
and defended. The best way to do
this would be to allow another stu—
dent on the committee. To this end
we have begun a nomination and
election process to select a student
to represent these interests on the
committee, The selection process
will be completed before the Thanks-
giving break.

We will forward the name of the
selected student to the Board shortly
after the Thanksgiving break, We
look forward to a constructive con-
sultation process with the Board, that
will pave the way towards the selec—
tion of a new President who will take
the college into the next century. We
look forward to your prompt re-
sponse.

Sincerely,

Dear Campus Community,

It has been made clear to us that
offense was taken to our ﬁrst e-mail
message. We would like to state
clearly that we do not accuse any
members of SGA of homophobia.
We apologize for any hurt feelings
caused by the initial e-mail. We
would like to apologize especially to
Erin Childress and Rebecca Eilcrs,
who felt personally targeted by the

e-mail message that we sent out on
Wednesday, November 12th through
the Stonewall Coalition e-mail ac-
count

Sincerely,

To the Grinnell College Community:

1 purposely waited two weeks to
write this in the hopes that I wouldn't
have to send this letter in, Howevel’r
to my dismay, the silence of the
college community (students,
faculty, and administrative staff)
showed that the letter had to be
written. When the 5&3 came out
with a front page article on Nov. 7,
1997 about automobiles being
vandalized, it was attached to
pictures showing a car painted with
“Die Niggers," and “I Hate Niggers."
On a universal scale,1 believe we can
all agree thaITHIS IS RACISM. We
Grinnellians do love to argue, but
“Die Niggers" doesn't really make
it too hard for us to choose which side
of the debate we want to defend. .

My problem is not with arguing if
this act is racist. My problem lies in
the fact that if this act is so blatantly
racist, and so anti anything Grinnell
College stands for, why, after two
weeks, has there not been a response?
I am asking everyone on the Grinnell
campus this question, especially
students, faculty, and administrative
staff who are not minorities. In
Grinnell‘s history, the min rity group
who gets slandered i itiates a
response. This process is not a
written rule, but it is followed, and
has not been broken, WHY NOT? I
understand that in certain situations,
non~minorities do not always agree
with the stand taken by the
protesters, which results in lack of
contribution. BUT THERE IS NO
DISAGREEMENT WHEN YOU
SEEATHE PHRASE “I HATE
NIGGERS"! What is the reason for
your passivity now?

Does CBS have to reserve the
Forum South Lounge, on a Thursday
night, for you to come and express
support? Do the students of color
always have to “complain" first
before we can get any nod of
sympathy from the rest of this
school? Where are you
administrators who want toincrease .
minority admissions and attract
minority professors to this school?
If you were an African—American
professor looking fora job, would the
school on the top of your list be the
one that doesn’t even react in support
of its own students? Where are you,
all the students who have said, “I feel
silenced by students of color because
they might call me racist?" Your
inability to initiate a Speakeasy, to
call the campus to a public forum, to
get off your butt and prove you are
not racist, demonstrates your
hypocrisy. Where are you Frank
Thomas, who stated in the Nov. 14th
8&3 article, “We are undertaking
tremendous efforts to ﬁnd, select.
and appoint minority faculty?"
Where are you Lizz Westman,
“Campus Cynic,” who in the last two
issues of the S&B has talked about
the TCI Cable Company and running
at the PEG, but had'nothing cynical
to say about the state of white apathy
on the campus? What about you
SGA? Is "Die Niggers” not heavy
enough to make the agenda? Hey
Sociology professors! Do you think
using the word “NIGGER” enhances
any power relationships?

Grinnell College: if you are not
RACIST, if you are not IGNORANT,
if you are not a HYPOCRITE,
SHOW IT.
