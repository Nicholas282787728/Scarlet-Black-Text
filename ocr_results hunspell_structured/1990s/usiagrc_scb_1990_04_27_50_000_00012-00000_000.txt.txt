it’s time to flnd out what the fuss
is all about.

Yes, the highly controversial
1989 film, The Last Temptation of
Christ is coming to Grinnell
College this weekend. I don’t
know about you. but the theatre in
my Midwestem home town didn't
date show Martin Scorsese's ver»
sion of lhe story of Jesus of Nazar
reth.

The ﬁlm is loosely based on
the 1955 novel by Greek author
Nikos Kazantzakis. Screenplay
writer Paul Schlader has taken
some liberties with the novel‘s
story line and has also added some
new scenes. Whilenotbased on the
actual accounts in the Bible. the
premise of the story depends on
Kazantzalds‘sassertion that“Christ
passes through all the stages

‘ ll-lELAST
TEMl’l'ATlON
OF CHRIST

which man who struggles passes
though. Thatiswhy hissuffering is
so similar to us; that is why we
share it."

Kazantzakis maintains that his
story was not a biography of Jesus
but the “confession of every man
who struggles.” As in the novel,

Chances Are Viewers
Will Like Chances Are

By Geoffrey Larson

Charters Are. a late»1987 my
lease by Tri»Star Pictures, features
Cybill Shepherd. Robert Downey
Jr..Ryan O’Neal, and Mary Stuart
Masterson. Conspicuous because
reviewers gave it little attention,
Chances Are remains a highly enr
joyable ﬁlm. For incurable softies.
it is a “happy tear-jerker." While
perhaps not in the category of the
“elite” ﬁlms of the recent decade,
this movie cenainly rates abovethe
rest of the pack.

Shepherd stars as a widow who,
for nearly twenty years, forsakes
any romantic relationships out of
sincere mourning over the unex-
pected death of her husband of one
year. She is unaware that when her
husband arrived at the pearly-gates
of Heaven, he insisted that he be
placed back on eanh immediately
so that he can ﬁnish some personal
business. Meanwhile,Sheperd,who
is pregnant at the time of his death.
raises their daughter and pursuesan
ambitious career.

Masterson (who debuted inSome
KiMofWonderquplays the daugh-

ter who meets her father‘s reincar-
nated persona (Downey) at Yale
Law School the day before heis to
graduate. and falls forhim. compli»
cating matters As“chance" would
have it, Downey, in his search [or
post- graduate employment, meets
up with his past-life best friend
(O‘Neal) who has remained a close
friend and ever-hopeful suitor to
Shepherd.

From there the movie unfolds
along the lines of a more personal
version of Heaven Cart Wait.
Downey constantly experiences
recollections ofa life nothis own
(actually, those of Shepherd's late
husband), while everyone else at-
tempts to ﬁgure out his sehiw»
phrenic nature. The relationships
between the characters evolvealong
lines which. while definitely being
out of the ordinary. are extremely
plausible given the circumstances.

Chances Are is entenaining
andrates special meritfor scoring
a Cher duet which, albeit mellow.
fonunately does not threaten
viewers with another, less desir-
able reincarnation of Sonny and
Cher.

Scorsese emphasizes the human
sideofJesus who“can understand
people‘sproblems; heexperienccs
loss, desire and other human
feelings and ftailties.” This
movie therefore emerges as a
fictionalized poniait of Jesus
through the imagination of its
ﬁlmmaker.

Willem Dafoe stars as Jesus.
Barabara Hershey as Mary
Magdalene. and David Bowie as
Pontius Pilate. The ﬁlm also fea-
tures music by Peter Gabrielr
