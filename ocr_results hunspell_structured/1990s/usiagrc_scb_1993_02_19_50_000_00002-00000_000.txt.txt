Where Bob's Underground stands today

By Konstantinos
Kambouroglou

is no news, that Bob’s Under
Eround has been in financial
straits ever since its opening,
last April. On Wednesday, Senior
Byron Johnson, who recently he
came the head of Bob’s manage
ment, talked to the 3&3 about the
financial situation 01 the coffee
house.

Bob’s has proven to be a money
loser. In a letter to SGA’s treasurer
Melissa Watson, on December 2,
Dinning Services’ Director Dave
McConnell has given a brief analy
sis and evaluation oI‘Bob’sl‘inancial
Situation, as it was at the end of last
(Fall) semester. The bottom line of
McConnell’sevaluauonisthatBob's
not only must balance the deficit
soon, but it must also yield profit in
the near future.

Johnson explained the exact
situation, According to the Operat-
ing Summary which accompanied
MeConnell's letter, by the 28th of
November the deficit was $996.60
(see ﬁgure, for graphic representa
tion of last semester’s weekly losses,
as found in McConnell's report).
Thatloss included “cquipmentcosts
and purchases [or smallwares,"
which, however are not a real debt,
because such assets were provided
by Dinning Services. This reduced
the loss to around $350 or, accordr

ing to McConnell, “about $31 per
week."

To further quote McConnell’s
letter, “mehanges will have to be
made beginning second semester to
reverse the current situation. ch~
cral steps will be undertaken to es
tablish Bob’s as a viable enterprise.
Initially, operating hours and sched-
uled labor will be adjusted to bring
costs into line. Additionally, the
menu willbcreviewedandexpandod
to attract a larger audience. A prob-
lem that won’t be easy to resolve Is

the smoking environment of Bob’s.
All of us believe that the level of
smoke in the facility restricts atten-
dance by a segment of the college
community, This problem will re-
quire some serious study and re-
view."

As known, the changes and ad-
justmcnls that McConnell‘s analy-
sis suggestod. have already been
made, or are to be made soon —
Johnson said that menu additions
are being discussed. The situation
then, should not be exceptionally

alarming, considering McConnell’s
conclusion. “As you can see the rev—
cnuc oi Bob’s [...] is lower than
anticipated,and it is unclear whether
it can grow very much, I am still
comfortable with the current
[Deccmber’s] situation, butwill get
more uncomfortable it we don‘t
make meaningful headway during
the coming semester."
