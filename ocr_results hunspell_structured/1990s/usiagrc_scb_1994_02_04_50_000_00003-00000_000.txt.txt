Letters from the Old World:
Part II — Swampland or

Rain-Infested Countryside?

By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

 

much of my free time during the past four weeks that I have been studying here. During

orientation, while we were still naive Americans, the North American Office took severity
of us on a trip up to the Lake District, the mountainous area just north ofLaneaster rcknowned for
its many lakes, stunning scenery and its history as the stomping grounds of Romantic poets William
Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge.

It was a rainy day, like most winter days in England, when we ventured up to the marshland of
the District. We set out early from Lancaster University on a double-decker bus and spent an hour
careening up and down and in and around the narrow, twisting roads that lead up to Grasmere, once
the residence ofWordsworth. Sitting at the top of the bus near the front, 1, along with several other
Americans used to grid-system roads and flat Iowa highways, thought we might be sick as the bus
roared down the highway at breakneck speeds. My friend Keoni. an American from Whitman
College in Washington,.gripped his way to the toilet and came back whiteAfaced, swearing that he
had read the odometer over the driver‘s shoulder at 95 mph going down a hill. English drivers. bus
drivers in particular, are anything but meek when it comes to driving. They fly into roundabouts
and around corners at reckless speeds and squeeze down narrow streets without hitting the brakes
at all. And there are few markings, if any. on the roads, so I don‘t know how they do it.

We hiked two miles up from Grasmere into the Lake District. Even in the rain and with a
ridiculous herd of seventy people, the countryside was stunning. It would have been quiet and
peaceful if there had not been seventy people there. We walked past incredibly green pastures
divided into small grazing areas by bushes and hedges of stone. Sheep marked with obnoxious red
splotches in the middle of their snow—white fleece raised their heads calmly as we passed, and didn't
seem to mind the noisy procession. As we got closer to the top of the mounrain. the landscape
changed from pastures and trees to rocky ledges and cliffs.

By the time thatwe had made it to the lake at the top of the mountain, it was trmc to head back.
Although it was only 3:00 pm, it was getting dark and nightfall was not far off. we were told by
a somewhat haggard and worried guide. Somebody had the bright idea of taking a shortcutand we
ended up literally wading through a rancid-smelling marshland. At any time of year, the Lake
District is moist, but during winter, the area is so saturated that some areas are nearly impassable,
The ground sounded like a giant suction cup when we walked and it was so wet that we were sinking
two feet into the muck -- our boots and jeans were covered in slimy mud. Around me, Americans
were falling, slipping and sliding down the mountain. It was quite a sight to behold. Thereafter,
I quickly learned the value of sidewalks and trails. Your feel may still get wet, but at least your
socks won't be soggy and dripprng water.

The town of Lancaster itself is pretty and the surrounding area is beautiful. The other day, a
couple of us hiked eight miles north out of Lancaster along the river Lune We walked along an
abandoned railroad past fat \ srnttil Villages and a decrepit castle that could have been the site of
Witt/wring Hﬂig/HS or a Radcl fian golhic novel. We rested at the only pub in a small town called
Cit-'nhy (pnpnltttinrr ibout 300) for lunch and gossiped with the local people. who kricwi tzlttll)‘
tlttttrr. L‘ \tClt‘ \‘tmngcr but were \ y friendly, They were gathered around the televrsion nttrehtng
the Winter Olympic rl drin tier. I told them i was fr it lrmn ("Is it close to New York or
ctrltrnrnrtt‘l") and they bought us ,. pint of t‘ldlr let being mnmwn.

Lancaster and the people here remind me tit" Grinnell in th tht‘ town is very rilrlil, laid-back
and fricnory. Lancaster differs from Grinnell in that |l is . y to get out of town and to a
metropolitan area quickly and Without hassles (at least if you understand the system, which is
another letter entirely.) There are Britrarl, numerous buses and cven boats that are inexpensive and
reasonable for poor college students who want to travel.

In my four weeks here, I've left Lancaster on weekends to visit Edinburgh, Scotland and
London. My escapades and adventures there will be the subJCCl of next week's letter. Until then,
cheers from England!

Green Frog helps link
college and community

By Becky Meyer

idea for a creative new pro-

gram was born. The pro-
gram would eventually involve
elementary school students from
the area, Grinnell High School
students and students from
Grinnell College, The Green
Frog program began as a goal: to
create an alternative activity for
students in the Grinnell commu-
nity, The idea came from
Grinnell College student Jeri
Kulik, who, after teaching work-
shops with a theater company in
Des Moines, decided to bring
children's theatre to Grinnell.

Kulik first went to Liz
Hansen, president ofthe Grinnell
Community Theater Board, with
her idea. Ms. Hansen was ex-
cited at the prospect; she had pre-
viously proposed the idea, yet no
attempt had been made to pursue
it. Kulik then went to her theater
class with her idea. She received
an encouraging response from her
fellow theater majors and they
began their planning. By the fall
of 1993, concrete plans had been
made and the program was on its
feet. Every month, students from
both the college and the high
school have been leading special

IN the spring of last year, the

workshops for the children, The
children play games, enact sto-
ries, and even do projects that
they can bring home.

Green Frog even produces
plays for children. In Septem~
ber, The Power of Wachumi was
cooperatively written and pro-
duced by six Grinnell College
students and performed four
times at different locations in
Grinnell, including at all of the
elementary schools,

Although Green Frog is
based on games and play, the
education gained is far from trite.
Green Frog promotes the learn—
ing of people skills by encourag~
ing children to interact playfully.
Children build their self-esteem,
learn cooperation skills and en-
rich their creativity: all skills
which Kulik explains as “essen-
tial to survival in the ‘adult'
world," By acting, the children
are able to “try on different per~
sonalities and therefore discover
their own.”

Although Green Frog is ayoung
program, its benefits to the commua
nity are immense. Not only do
Gn'nnellchildren explore new worlds
of creativity and learning, the citi»
lens of Grinnell and the students of
the college are encouraged to work
together in a fun and creative enviv
