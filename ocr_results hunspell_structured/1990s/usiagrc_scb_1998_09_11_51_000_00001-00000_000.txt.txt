This model ofthe playhouse project is currently making the rounds of local banks. Board members ofGrinnell
Productions are now seeking a major donor for the $5 million effort.

It’s crunch time for Gnnnell Pro-
ductions, the local theater enterprise

that’shoping to developaCommerciaI.

St. playhouse and gallery that will put
the community on the arts map.

If enough money can‘t be raised to
fund the ambitious, $5»million project
by the end ofthe academic year next
May, board members may have to ask
themselves whether they should con-
tinue their efforts, said Pip Gordon,
associate professor of theater at Gi-ina

Autumn brings with it almost more
things than one can cope with, to ex-
press life ungrammatically.

Last week in quick succession came
the tenth anniversary of the Gnnnell
Airport, the dedication of the “new"
Davis Elementary School and then
Happy Days with its carnival and clas-
sic auto show, and then this week
brought Ag Appreciation Day events
on Thursday in Central Park,

One aspect of Ag Appreciation Day
to which Around always looks for-
ward is the incredible parade of res
stored antique tractors: All that lurch-
ing and groaning, the acrid fumes of
the fuel, that belching smoke and the

look ofpnde on the faces ofthose who.

have restored the giant machines.
What a blastl!

Speaking ofthe dedication of Davis
Elementary School, apparently the H-
R committed a grievous error in iden—
tifying the current occupants of the
former boiler room at the school by
mentioningonlythe music department
as having succeededto the space when
actually the art department also has its
share ofthe room.

Duane Murray, Grinnell-Ncwburg
Elementaryarttcacher,wantstheworld
to know that budding artists also have
their space at Davis.

Murray was in the limelight in zinc
other way last week as he took his
second-grade an students at Fairview
Elementary School to the home oflulie
and Scott Beach across Sixth Avenuc
from Gnnnell Implement on the east
edge ofGn'nnellsotheycould drawthe
wonderful shiny red farm machinery.

The youngsters, who included the
Beach‘s son Nathan, then found their
art work in a downtown store window,
iiinong many others, in celebration of
Ag Appreciation Day.

To top off the students' artistic en-
deavors, .lulie Beach had a chocolate-
chip cookie bar for each one.

The Mystery Object submitted by
Harriet Dickeerhasins remains a eu—
nosity although there have been glim-
mers ofrecognition from a couple folk
citing it as a part of a cistern pump,
even though at only 7 inches high it
seems a mile small to some who have
viewed it,

“We are looking forsomeone to buy
into our dream," Gordon said in an
interview this week. “We’re looking
forabenefactorfortheprojectisome
individual or some foundation who
believes in this project enough to say,
‘Here’s a million-dollar matching
grant.‘ Ifthat person or foundation can
be identiﬁed, many other organiza-
tions and individuals will come on
board once they feel the project is
going to be a success."

An ambitious project

Gnnnell attorney Torn Lacina, a
member of the Gnnnell Productions
board, agreed, although both he and
Gordon stressed that the organization
isn'ttrying to make its plea sound like
an ultimatum.

“The project is an ambitious one,“
hesaid.“We’retryingtocreateafacilr

One ofthose who has submitted this
identiﬁcationisLarry KephartofGrin-
nell who believes that it is the bottom
half ofa clstem pump which sits on a
counter.

Vadena FisherofHolidayLake, how-
ever, has another take on the MO and
claims it is the base ofa very old water
heater,

Considering that the MO was dis—
coveredinthe basementofthe Dickey-
Chaslns home, one of Grinnell's hiss

ﬁcations seems plausible.

Maybe we're getting close!

will really speak for Grinnell andbe an
attention-getter."

Gnnnell Productions has sent out
more than lZO applications for founr
datlongrants,butsofarthere'sbeenno
big score. Gordon said there are many
foundations in the region dedicated to
the arts, but most of them are either
community specificorernployee spe-
ciﬁc.

“It narrows the field," she said.
Local contributions

The communityofGrinnellhasbeen
generous, but local funding sources
aren’t enough to support the whole
concept, Gordon said. So board mem-
bers no longer feel they can be open—
ended in terms ofa timetable.

“I thinkit‘s important to say thatthe
reason we have come as far as we have
is because of the generosity of Grin»
nell,” Gordon explained, ”But all the
donors have been local. When you're
dealing with this kind oi'campaign,it's
enough to get us this far. But we‘re at
a whole different level ofgiving now.
People with the big moneynow needto
step forward.

“This project is two years old. The
people on our board ofdirectors have
other things we can be doing, and
there’s a sense that we don’t want to

push a dead horse ‘ I don’t know a _

more elegant way of saying that. But
thisissomethingthatcan’tbenickeled
and dimed."

Model on display

An architectural rendering of the
theater/art center concept is making
the rounds of local ﬁnancial institur
tions and is currently on display at
Grinnell State Bank. The Cunningham
GroupofMinneapolis.Minn.,haspror
vided the design, which involves propr
eriies on the western half block of
Commercial Street’s south side just
éast of Main St.

Grinnell Productions has acquired

three pieces of property for the de-
velopment. So far,anewroofhasbeen
installed on the Foster-Bailey building
on the comer, and the adjacent Dams
building has been tuckrpointcd. Brick
on the west side of the complex has
been replaced, and brick Is available
for the south side.

Also part of the complex is a third
property acquired from Carl Orr.

“But we don't have the funding right
now to ﬁnish that," Tom Laclna said.
“We'd like to do it tllis fall. Ifwe had
$20,000 to $25,000, we could get that
done. and maybe that‘s a high esti»
mate."

Gnnnell Productions wants to pro
duce plays and musicals in the theater
area, as well as offer arts»edueation
programs in the art center and exhibi-
tions in the gallery. Ofﬁce and support
space also are in the plans, as is a full
drop in the playhouse so that there will
be a full fly space for sets, Lacina said.

Deciding what to offer

The aim‘is to offer the types ofarts
education local residentswant, whether
they include such things as drawing
and dance classes, after-school pro-
gramming for children, and other
things,

“We want to be arts leaders in the
community, but we also want to be
responsive to the community,” Lacina
said. “We want programs that chal-
lenge, yet satisfy. There should be
something going on at the playhouse
and art center every weekend. We're
not going to be bringing in ‘Cats," but
we could bring in smaller shows ——
comediesandmuslcals withsmallcasts,
improvisational performances, magic
shows, etc. Then we could develop a
regional following, with people saying
that Grinnell is the place to come."

Grinnell Productions needs $2.2
million for completion ofthe art cen—
ter, including the ofﬁce and support
space, andSl.8 million forcompletion
of the playhouse, Lacina said,

Can be successful

Pip Gordon said that her board has
explored the concept in depth and has
concluded that the project can be suc-
cessful.

“Grinnell deserves a preject like
this," she said. “It’s like our hospital.
People say, ‘Wow, how can a small
town havesuchagreathospital?‘ itean
be the same with the playhouse and an
center. In the bigger picture, when you
look at the service this program will
provideforyeung pcople,$5 million is
not too much to ask,”

Other members of the board are
Becky Eurkhardt, associate professor
ofmusic at the University ofNorthem
Iowa; Rod Caspers, a program coordi-
nator at the University of Texas; Scott
lhi-ig, an associate in a Minneapolis
law ﬁrm; Kristina Marty, director of
the Grinnell Productions Arts Coop-
erative; and Erik Sanning, theater de—
partment technical director at Grinnell
College who works frequently at the
Des Moines Civic Center.

 

A baseball renaissance

No one who watched Mark McGwire eclipse Roger Maris’s homermri
record Tuesday could have done so without a sense of awe, given the sheer
magnitude ofthc Cardinal's feat. Not only'did McGwire do so in 145 galnes
(it took Maris 162 games to hit 6i and Babe Ruth 15A games to slug 60), it
was a virtual certainty that he would hit a few more before the season ends,
So will Sammy Sosa, the charming Cubs right fielder who still stands a

chance ofmoving past McGwire
by the time it's all over for 1998,
But there has been more than the
home-run chase that has brought
people back to ilie ballparks this
season. After that numbing strike
ofa few years ago, many were
writing the sport‘s obituary. For a
time, it appeared that the game was

indeed moribund, Attendance dropped by a staggering 17 percent the
following year, and fans continued to be turned off by news of owners and
playcrs competing for the title ofgrcedicst.

When the season began thisspnng, though, there was a feeling that
something was in the air. And now that it's September and the Cubs are still
actually in contention for a wild card berth in the playoffs, McGwire and
Sosa continue to smash majestic shots into the bleachers and beyond, young
players show promise of future grcatncss, and the Yankees are producing the
tnost awcsomc won-loss record in memory, there is'more than iicw hope for

the game.

One ofthe spinoffs from the compelling Meowirc-Scsa saga might well be
that others in the game will follow tltc two supcrstars‘ example and cone
scieusly adopt demeanors ofcivllity and grace. Sure, the big guys are making
millions, But there’s none ofthat sullen attitudc that characterizes too many
in profcssional sports. That’s one ofrhc reasons the fans have taken to
McCiwlre and Sosa with such enthusiasm.

Onc season doesn‘t necessarily guarantee the sport's ctcrnal health. But
1998 has proved that baseball is still a wonderful game that can inspire
millions. It‘s been a season to remember. And the best thing is that it isn't

over yet.

Voters 0K increase
in support levy

Voters in the Grinnell-Netvburg
School Distncton Tuesday approveda
levy increasc that will fund all-day
kindergarten and allow the district to
hire a third elementary school pnnci—
pal.

Bodensteiner was referring to the
Vote Yes for Kids Committee, co-
chaircd by Barb Baker and Steve

AvalosrBock. The group conducted a
Labor Day telephone campaign to get
out the vote.

Avalos-Bock also expressed gratin
rude forthe positive votc.

“We‘re very grateful to all Grinnell
voters whotooktimetoleam aboutthe
levy and concluded that it provides the
very best for elementary education in
the district," he said. “I’d also like to

Yes for Kids Committee."

ably for the next school year, each of
the administrators will hold another

tor of continuing education, another

Bed and breakfast

The Old Mill Riverside Inn owners
plan to use a portion oftheir proceeds
to help local churches.

The Van Der Zyls said in a prepared
statement: “The group believes deeply
thatthls venture, aswcllasalltltings in
life, should be firmly anchored in
strong, basic Christian values. With
this stated, [the group is] pledging l0
percent of the total annual gross rev»
cnue (less food receipts) to go to a
newly formed cooperative group of
local churches eamlarked for Youth
Outreach."

The group of owners is trying to
recruit a couple to become resident
managers, hosts and part owners ofthe
inn, Requirements for the position are
that the couple have “deep family and
church—rooted values," the Van Der
Zyls said.

“These persons will not only be a
strong asset to the inn, but also to thc
coininunityatlarge,"they added.“Food
for the inn will be catered exclusively
by the Lynnville Cafe, owned and op.
cratcdbyDaleandEcrtSchliell,\vhose
hard work and dedication to the com-
inunity are well known to all who live
here rind will be evident and appreci-
ated by future visitors.

“The group hopes the Old Mill Riv-
erside Inn can fill a niche that has been
void in our communities for many.
litany years."
