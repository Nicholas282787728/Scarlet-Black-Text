Student movie Rescue 4]] triumphed at Titular Head

winning director sophomore Kevin

'ch made his movie for the annual
ﬁlm festival the day before the deadline,
then editeditlhedayofthedeadline, ltwas
much to his smprise, lhen,when his Re:-
Cue 411won thefestlva]: he had far lower
expectations for his ﬁlm's reception, he
said.

“I thought I was just going to get
ganged," he said, referring to the rate of
Titular Head ﬁlms unpopular with the
judges. Tohavethe“gong"struckcutsthe
movie. Rich elaborated further on the
origin oﬂiisfears:“ltwasalldialogue,and
there weren‘t any bulls or guns or any
thing, and lwas aﬁaid that they wouldn’t
beableloheareveryone orsomethinglike
that but they did, they heard everything.”

luniorEleanorDodson,whocoordir
natad this year's Tltular Head with the
help of senior Bill Wells. said that some
thing as simple as audibility of the dia-
logue in a movie can be one of the main
criteria in whether a movie is successful.
“I think that the technical aspects of the
movies had a lol to do with whether they
got gonged or not. Not all of them, a
couple of them got gongod because the
dialogue Wasn’t goingover very well, but
lthrnk a lot of'em were gonged because
they couldn’t hear the dialogue,”

Dialogue was not a feature of either
orthe ninnerSrup to Rcscuc4/I. College
Days, by junior Sam Heinrich and the
equally script-tree the Dance ofBrizvl
Kahlil: bythepseudonoriliclohnnmend.
Rich said that the key to success “is an
8mm camera because it has betmr sound.
You can’t hear VHS at all and everyone
hasVH ."

That‘s a pretty thin dividing line
between victory and failure. Dodson
said she hopes that the gong, which was
an innovatton thts year, wtll cause pro~
spective ﬁlmmakers to pay mom attenr
tlon to that line, improving the quality or
the ﬁlms in the whole festival. “lfsomer
one got their movie gonged, then next
yeartheynrightwhen Llieymakeamovie,
pay more attention to editing it and the
quality or it." She added that, though
there have been some negative com-
ments on the gong, “I’ve gotten mostly
goodgongfeedback. Bad Ioedbackabout
how the gong was used, but good feed-
backaboutthe gongilself. And [guess
we’re goutg to have the gong next year."

In the end, of course, the success or
failure ofci ﬁlm does come down to more
than audibility, The movie has to enter
tainthe crowd, wltichptoks by applause,

chosen by the Judges. Rich‘s Rescue

intrigued him for a while: “I always
thought that a funny Titular Head movte
would be a spoof. I just watched an
episode [erkcscttc 911], and thought of
all the dirrerent ways you could go with
that.”

Rich butltabastc plotforthe movie,
then let his three main actorsisopho-
more Emily Bergl as a ﬁ-antic caller in
need of aplionenumber, seniors Michael
Hicks as the 411 operator and Nathan
Brant as the nanator—build off of that.
“I knew what] wanted, and Ihad written
down what I needed, so basically, all
three of the main actois weie actors, so I
justsald ‘havefunx ltold them whatthey
needed to say. but not exactly how they
had to say it They played with it. and
thenlgot to pick and choose thefunniest
stuff.”

Berglsaid oftheexpericnce,”lt was
a very cooperative process. because we
both had ideas that we thought of for the
shots. I thought of trying to put on my
pants forthe entire scene, and he thought
ofsomedifferent kindsofcamera angles
and of using the fact that my room was
really messy at the time."

The band formed earlier thisday semes
ter when Leach decided it was time to
build onthesoloacousticmusic he’dbeen
workingon all year. “I was gellingpretty
bored pmﬁcmg and playing by myself
alltheu'me,"hesaid. ”WhenAamn came
back from Chicago [after ﬁnishing the
Chicago Semesterin theArtspmgram].I
played some songs for him and he liked
them, solasked him ifhe‘cljo'tn me," The
searchforapercusslonisttookabillollger,
as “All the dnlmmers on this campus are
so overworked. But then David showed
up at diis Drum Circle jam sessron — I
didn't even know he played dntms. 1
called him that night, and I think we had
ourflrstrehearsal the next day." Arlo said.

Within a few weeks, the group was
traveling to Java Joes to play foropen trite
nights. Soon. they were approached by
the tnahagcrabotttalchgcr show. Atlava
Jocs they also met Kyle Patton. a local
blues nluslctztn who offered them some

After such a prorntstng start, it’s un-
lottutiale that Wednesday's Show will
probably be the Jammill' Salmon '5 last,
butArlo‘sgl-aduauon thlsmontliculs their
future rather short. He explained, “David
andlwill bombein town forthesumtner,
so we‘ll keep playing together, and if
we can pick up more gt gs tn Des

may be able to talk Aaron into driving
over from Chtcago. But we basically
went into this knowing it would be a
onersemester deal."
