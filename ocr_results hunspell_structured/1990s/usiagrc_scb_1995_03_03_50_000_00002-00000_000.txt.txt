NITARIAN Universalists
(UU) may not be widely
understood on campus.

When one student was asked what
sheknewaboutthegroup,shereplied
“Arcn’tthey thosepeoplcwhodo the
mystical crystal things?" No, they
aren't. Chalutzim,ontheotherhand,
is probably better known, although
often considered more of a cultural
group than a religious group. Both
are featured this week in order to
dispel some of the myths and clear a
few misconceptions.

The Unitarian Universalists hold

‘The only place you're actually
going to find spirituality is in yourself,"
said ﬁrst year Ben Stallings. "There's a
little part ofGod in everybody,"

Another member said that the
group provides “interesting conver-
sation." She felt it was a refreshing
alternative from the typically marl-

juana induced “deep" conversnttons
one encounters on campus. The UU
religion is based on the Bible and
continued to grow by adopting the
works of Thoreau and Emerson,
Members continue to read “not only
spiritual writings, but writings that
are spiritual,” said Stalllngs. For

example, Zen and the A7r of Molar-
cycle Maintenance was brought up
during the last discussion group,
Members not only participate in
discussion during the weekly meet-
ings but also through the Unitarian
Universalists notes program on the
VAX. Anyone interested in the tops
ics ofdiscussion contribute to these
ongoing UU debates. Topics vary,
including “Who is this ‘God' person
unyway’!",“Whon-tdoyou admire7",
and the concept of masks in society.
One result of setting up this note
board was the discoveiy that many
members of tlic Pagan Discussion
Circle on campus expressed interest.
“There are a lot of similarities" be

tween topics discussed in the UU
notes and those discussed at Pagan
meetings, Stallings said

Ideas forservices are also shared
in the notes program. If God is in
everyone and individual spititual de-
velopment is iinponant, why is there
a need tor group services?

“You can always learn some-
thing in a religious service," said
Stallings, He approaches a service
with the idea that “there’s got to be
something I can learn about my-
self. about other people. It's lmpol'r
tant to continue that sort of growth"

Chalutzim

Chalutzlm focuses on sharing
teivish culture and rcligion in order
to provide a sense of community for
lewrsh students and educational op~
poi-tuiiities foranyoneinterested, The
groupprovides“religiousobservance
in a cultural setting," explained first
year Rachel Weiss.

Allortlie niajorJewish holidays
are celebrated by Cltalutzim. This is
not always easy due to the absence of
a synagogue in Grinnell. Often the
group arranges trips to Des Moines
or another town to celebrate hollr
days Weiss said this was important
for members not only because they
can then observe holidays. but they

can be in a Jewtsh community that
isn'tjust college studean.

In addition, Shabbat table is held at
6:00 pm. Friday nights at l127 Park
Street, cheklyorganizauonalmecting
is held at l l :45 sun. on Thursdays in the
same place, Events are also planned in
which aspects ofculture and religion are
explained and explored, For example.
“Voices of Seplmrad" is an upcoming
event featuring music and aspeakerpcr-
taining to Sepharuc Culture.

When the group joins together in activi—

Junior Amy Goldmacher, who just
retunied from a semester abroad, said
that upon her return she “felt the need to

magizine what does the av

of? Judging from the thoughts expressed
by many students, the answers are such
negative appraisals as piles otdiscardod
copies lying around the mailroom, a
slickrlooking corpoiate tool disguised as
a general interest publication for college
students and a bunch of thirty-some-
things trying to be hip and reach out to
Generation Xrers.

Link Magazine. published by Cree

free to over one million college students.
The magazine is completely paid for

boarding and environmental action.

The purpose of Link according to
editor Mark Chamock. is to “give some
one at tiny little insight that they didn't
have before, or maybe a laugh between
clmses, or maybe the incentive to write a
letter orjoin a cause." Grinncll students

Link, althoughnot in sense thatChamock
suggested.

Students have many complaints
aboutthe magazine. “It mes tobesomer
diing it isn't," said jumor Miles Stem,
who is amonganumberotstudcnis who
have communicated with Chat-hock via
email,

”The writing is poor, the articles
lack substance, and whenever I read an
article I always get this feeling that the
author is trying hard to connect with
me. and failing,”saidsenior Matt Haber,
A major concern with Grinnell stur
dents is the magazine’s environmental
sensibilities, “Lurk demonstrates its hy-
pocrisy by purporting tobeenvironmeir
tally concemctt, yet publishing 1L9 maga-
zine on high-gloss noncrecyclable pa-
per," commented Haber. If Gnnnell is
anything to judge by, Link sends out
many unwanted copies and uses unnoo
essary paper in the process. Ben Chit-i,
