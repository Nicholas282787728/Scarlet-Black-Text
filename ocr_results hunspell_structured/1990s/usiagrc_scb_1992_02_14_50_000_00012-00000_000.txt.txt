Women's basketball team 7
continues domination;

Win streak reaches six games, setting stage
for showdown against Illinois College

By Alex Severens

The red hot Grinnell women’s
basketball team took their show on
the read last week when they visited
a hostile court at Coe College and
fought their way to a thrilling 66-58
victory. ThePioneers were down 347
33 at the half, but came through with
some cmcial buckets late in the game
to put Coe away and improve their
record to 1176.

The pace of the game allowed
CoachEskildsen toplayonly six play-
ers. “Time moved really quickly, and
the players didn’t need as much rest."
Eslcildsen had high praise for all the
players in the victory, but put in spe—
cial praise for Megan Shucknecht.
Shuckneeht, primarily known for her
quickness on defense. poured in six
crucial points during crunch time,
allowing the black and red to put Coe
away.

Grinnell had the hot hand through-
out the entire contest, shooting an
impressive 53.8% from the floor,
while holding the home team to just
31.3% from the field. Shannon
Hancock and Jenny Wood provided
the bulk of the offense,combining for
38 points.

The tiring gameat Coe did have an
effect on the women, as they ap-
peared a bit fatigued in their 6663
squeaker over Monmouth College on

the following Saturday. Coach
Eskildsen said ofthe team‘s effort, “I
knew that thegarne againstCoe would
tire our starters out. The first thing
that goes wrong with zitired team is its
shot." Grinnell’s shot was definitely
not there against Monmouth, as they
started the game shooting just 3 for
17.

Despite the poor shooting perfor»
mzinee, Eskildsen pointed to some of
the team’s aecomplishmean which
helped provejust how strong the Pio-
neers are. “We did two things which
a good team needs to do: We made a
great run at the end of the half to pull
ahead of Monmouth. and we found
ways to win when wewcren’tplaying
well. Our players are doing every-
thing they can, individually and Cole
leetively, to make this team win.”

Hancock again provided much of
the offense for the team as she put in
21 points,and hauleddown l7boards.
Point guardJen Kelley’s 1 5 rebounds
were another highlight in the victory.

The fans made the Monmouth
game even more memorable, as they
brought whatever spare toilet paper
they could find to the game. The
pumped up crowd made Coach
Eskildsen pleased. “I‘m glad to see
people having fun at games. Basket-
ball is a happening. notjust a game."

basketball season to date will take
place this Saturday when the blisterv
mg hot 153 Illinois College team
will try to use Grinnell to extend its
unblemished conference record to 9-
0. lllinois will be trying to redeem
itselfin frontoftheDarbycrowdaftcr
losing here twice last year, allowing
the Pioneers to win the Conference.
Eskildscn knows how tough the Illi-
nois Collegeteam is. “Thisteam ison
an 11 game win streak, and they beat
us 77-58 in Illinois earlierin theyear.
However, the players from Illinois
have nightmares about Darby Gym
because of last year‘s games. We
have the best fans in the conference,
and if we want to win, we must have
the crowd support.”

Illinois College has an enortnous
inside game, and Grinnell cannot
match up with their height in the

paint. For that reason, the Pioneers .

will be looking to use their guards to
prevent the Illinois guards from get-
ting the ball in to their big people.
Eskildsen stressed the importance of
making life miserable for the Illinois
guards. “We have to stop the source
from feeding the finishers," he said.
“We will have to create havoc 0
their guards if we are going to win.

Grinnell and Illinois College are
the two mams vying for the conferr
encechampionshipanda win against
Illinois on Saturday would help keep
Grinnell in the hunt.

Men‘ s basketball hits
snag against Coe

By Jeff Wirtz

The Men's Basketball Learn had
an up and down weekend. The Pio-
neers beat Vennard College 6443
last Friday night, but then lost to
Midwest conference rival Coe Col-
lege on Saturday 6156.

Coach David Arseneault described
the Vennard garneas “amueh needed
break in thePioneers' schedule.” The
game was never really close, as
Grinnell was six for six in three point
shooting,withCraig StuderaridStevc
Diekmann sinking three each. Just
four minutes into the game. the Pio-
neers had jumped out to a 214 lead.
The starters were then pulled out and
the second team got to play the rest of
the game. Arseneault said, ”It’s been
hard to find time for the reserves this
season because there have been so
many close games," adding that “it
was good for them to get some time”.
Mike Patterson lead Grinnell with a
career high ll points followed by
Diekmann, Studer and Ty McGuire
with nine points each. Other key
contributors were Jim “Superfly”
Williams with a game high ninc rel
bounds and Ben Root, who grabbed
eight boards.

Arsneult noted that the Pioneers
played outstanding defense against
the Kohawks. “especially Todd
Young vs. Eric Johnson and Jason
Francl vs. PatReid". Johnson was 0
for 15 from the floor and Francl held
Reid to only 13 points Arsencault

said, “defensively we did what we >
wanteu, the guys put 10an the eitort ‘,
and stayed within the limits.“ He
added that the Pioneers were “much ‘
more aggressive last Saturday than ,
[in laSt week‘s game against Cool"
and that had the Pioneers played this ‘
well in their first meeting with Coe.
they would have won. Arseneault
concluded that a big factor in this‘
contest was the depth of the benches. >
He said, “we were two players short _
in our rotation,they hadnine rotating.
and we only had seven and that“
eventully wore us out“. ,
The Pioneers. whose record stands

at 7-9 overall and 3-6 in the confer-V
encc, will try to finish the year with «
their firstwinning season since 1963- _
1964. They play four out of their last
five games in Darby, including'
rematches with conference foes Illir
nois College and Knox, after travel-
ling to Monmouth. Grinnell’s next‘
conference game is tonight against.
Cornell Collegeat Mt. Vernon at7:00.
“Cornell’s defense is very good, and‘
the game willbe low scoring and hardl
fought," Arsenault said. “And hopev,
fully,theembarassmentatMonmouth
will motivate us this time around." ‘
