Sculptural Paper class explores Burling

space with site

ovjnarcs AN'rlloFmt

Bur-ling Library plays an integral role in
the Grinneil experience. From fnst seeing stu-
dents huddled in concentration mound tables
or napping in the tops oftrcehouses (lilting ‘il
tour to the marathon studying of finals week,
many Grinnclliaiis have a close attachment
to a certain area in the library. Lec liunnmg's
Sculptural Paper class explored those connec—
tions with their sitcsspecifie installations (dcs
signed with the intention ofbeing displayed in
a certain space) in the library, up now through
rli end of the semester,

The artists ventured into the wide-tang-
ing spirit of Hurling, examining visceral con-
nections with the dark stacks and llglil’ﬁlled
atrium, to interact with the spaces in the lie
brary and give them deeply personal identities,
"1 think it's about embodying different charac-
teristics of the library, but in some ways open-
ing those things up," said Running.

The students worked with paper from start
to finish. Beginning with a class trip to Iowa
City where they harvested pulp from mulberry
trees, they experimented with making paper
during the ﬁrst half of the semester. “They
had this sort of arsenal of tools, and so then
we turned that whole tool set on the library,"
said Running.

Students submitted proposals to the library
after each of them chose a site. The whole
process was aimed towards collaboration and
creating art that would be both personal for
the students but also practical for the library.
“We had a little bit of negotiation on some of
the proposals, but most ofthem didn’t require
any kind of change,"
said Richard Fyffe,
librarian of the Col-
legs.

The installation

in Burling is part
of an overall goal of
the library staff to
use the space more
effectively and cte-
atively. This sum-
mer’s renovation
jumpsstarred the trend, which has continued
with events like poetry and literature readings.
“Having these events in the library gives them
a different kind of meaning," said Fyffc. "So
we’re interpreting the space in some ways, but
bringing the art in was an especially exciting
one."
The viewer can easily see these kinds of
collaborative processes at work. None of the
installations seem forced or our of place, and
many seem to grow naturally out of the wall or
stairs or shelfwhcre they are placed.

Paula Matallana '10 placed paper that
hangs and creeps around the shelves in the La-
tino Collection on the ﬁrst ﬂoor where it was
spiritually born. its title, “Macondo Lives only
In The Mind," from a Gabriel Garcia Mar
quez short story, emphasizes just how related
the work is to its site,

Another installation, Veronica Erb ’08’5
“Hemispheres,” relates directly to the class’s
process of improvisation and creation. Etb’s
idea sprang
from some
work she had
been doing
casting bowls
from the pa— ,
per, when - : _
she realized,
without pres
viously planning it, that they would perfectly
fit her site inside a treehouse on the first ﬂoor.
“I was looking at the library as a space, but also
as architecture," she said. "I want those hem‘r
spheres to fit within the space,and kind oflive
there."

search he had done in his Religious Studies
classes to come up with the idea for his installa-
tion,"Burqa,"which fits right next to a permas
nently displayed art piece on the wall (located
at the front
windows on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor)
and sets up
an interests

between the
site-specific
work of the
class and the classically sanctioned idea ofart.

“It’s been really fun and challenging to in
trodute your own work into a public space,"
said Schechter. His forms, despite their 835*

mysterious projects because of their simultane-

shape.

With such diversity in form and style, the
installations in Burling don’t have any sort of
overriding theme to
them. The greatest
lesson drawn from
them may just he
how exciting itwould
be for more sitesspet
cific installations to
happen on campus
in the ﬁiture.
