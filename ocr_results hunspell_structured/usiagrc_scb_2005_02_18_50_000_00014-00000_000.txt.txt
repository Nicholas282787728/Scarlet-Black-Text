Lebanese assassination
and its implications

Monday's sination by car bonrb of Lebanese runner Prune
Minister Rank Harm in Beirut surprised many who assumed that
Lebanon had left its strife-ridden past behind it when its civil war
ended formally in 1990. Not so, to the more prying observer, French
President Jacques Chirac hit the nail on the hcad when he accuscd
Syrian military intelligence of orchestrating the attack, Chirac, along
with the U.S,, had recently been pressuring Syria to end its military
occupation oi’chanon, even diafting a UN. security council reso-
lution (Resolution 1559, which was unanrmously adopted) [0 that
end, In tlus context, the lac Primc Minister Harri-i posed quite a
threat to Syria's hold over Lebanon, given his prethstcru/antit
syria stances, not to mention his iticndship with President Chitac.

Fair enough, one might say. This seems to make sense so far, with
Hariri playing the role of in internal th \[ to Syrian political domie
nance and with powerrul Western backi g. But this has always been
the case. Why, then, did syrra new tensions .rs having escalated to
the point at which such a brutal and controversial car-bomb blast was
warranted? The Isracli intcrnct news scwicc, chkacom - onc ofthc
world's top private intelligence ﬁrms , ol'rcrs two motives First, in ads
ditron to demanding Syrian troop withdrawal rrorn Lebanon, the us.
Bush Administlatlon had in recent weeks urged syrra to dismantle the
real source or its power in Lebanon: the Syrian and Lebanese rrrrel-
ligcnce agencies and secret policc who control Lebanese polmcs from
the inside out.

This painted Syrian President Bashiu iiltAssnd into a corner, {or
rvhereas previous Western demands for, troop withdrawal allowed
him to make the symbolic concession or moving troops while so
ctetly preserving his dominance over Lebanon, this demand hit him
where it hurt. Secondly, the above-mentioned UN Resolution 1339
contained a clausc that legitimized Lebanon's signing a peace treaty
with the start of Israel, which would have, nccdlcss to say, not been
syrra's preference. Prime Minister Hariri, along with two other lead
ing anti—Syrian Lebanese politicians, immediately capitalized on this
clarrsc. Had their plans succeeded, Syria’s President Assad would have
looked like a warmonger abroad tor opposing them and would havc
scented weak, rccklcss and incl'fcclual at home, where a calm, conﬁr
dent ruler is needed to keep Syria’s various rival factions in check.

I myself, as a close and avid observer of the Middle East, would
like to propose two additional motives tor the attack. soon after the
bombing occurred, a group on the internet claimcd responsibility tor
the attack as a suicide bombing in the name ora previously unknown
islamist terror organization called “The Movement for Victory and lit
had in Bilad alrShcm," For those of you who don’t speak terrorist-esc,
Bilad itlrSlicm refers to Greater sytra, or the areas that now comprise
syi in, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Syria cont
sidets Bilad al-Shem to be its manifest destiny, and the leading Islamist
terrorists have recently indicated that they too wish to further their in-
tercsts in these areas (instead of concentrating on just Iraq).

Furthermore, hours after the group claimed responsibility, Lebanese
security forces searched the home of the purported suicide-bomber.
This seems suspicious bccausc groups like aleQaida rarely irever carry
out attacks without the requisite infrastructure to protect and keep scr
cret their support networks from law enforcement.

My theory is that Syria allowed these Islamists to claim the attack in
order to exculpatc itself (indeed, President Assad strongly condemned
the attack), and then to win back a bit of Western favor by soorrafter
“cracking down" on the responsible parties as a contribution to the War
on Terror. This is all complex and perhaps speculative sturigl know, but
it could have grave implications for the most important region in the
world.

Channel PC power to fight disease

I am writing to ask members of the Grinndl community to al-
low their unused pcrsonal computer capacity at school and at home to
be used for a project to understand human proteins and disease, The
project is called the World Community Grid and was developed by
IBM in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, the World
Health Orynization and the Unlwd Nations. For success, millions of
volunteers worldwide are needed to contribute their unused computer
capacity for success. The ﬁrst mission is to identify all the proteins in
the human body and determine their functions (no small task), Other
tasks will be selected. With knowledge of normal protein structure and
ﬁlnction, researchers can develop treatments for diseases, the great ma-
jority ofwhich are believed to modify human proteins. specific diseases
targeted include AIDS, Alzheimer’s, malaria and cancer.

To participate and learn more, go to the World Community Grid
website at wwworldcommunirygridorg and register. The project en-
courages romration or teams with common interests, I have created
one for Grinnell College. Please sign up and yoin the Grinnell college
team, or Join on your own. This is a good project.

Grinnell sports
beyond basketball

To the Editor:

I have it question. Do your spoits writcis only spend time going to
basketball games and speculating about the basketball team? Because it
is ridiculous that in the last issue orthc 3&3 (February 11,2005) there
were 2 ‘/2 pages ofarticlcs about the basketball team, one sentence about
the swim team, one sentence about the track team, and nothing about
tennis. At a school wheic the swim team has one of the highest numbers
orstudent athletes, don’t you think you are cutting us short> Don't get me
wrong, I think it is great that the basketball team was on ﬁne My
only objection rs thrt your neuspaper is not doing its job by providing
ul of the news i understand that there may not be enough space, or that
theic is a budget to be concerned about. But it you took out one of the
pictures from basketball, wouldnt tbcrc be enough room for an article
about another sport> My challenge to you is (0 increase the coverage of
other sports tcniiis.\/Vc an know and love basketball, but it is not the only
sports team on campus.

Learn true leftist values

David Montgomery's piece last week (me true liberal err/rot) rs
a perfect example or the kind orweakness and ideological idiocy that
have crippled the American lert. David, you are correct in saying that
Grrnnelhans- ought to attempt to “understand why so many people in
this country have deeply felt moral concerns about gay marriage," How»
ever, your analysis leaves out a particularly nreanrngtul caveatWe should
scck to understand those who oppose gay marriage in otdcr to change
their minds and destroy their ideology orhate. We have forgotten that
it is perfectly acceptable to be intolerant of hatred. Understanding must
have a motivation behind it, and we must be motivated to annihilate a
dominant ideology ofarmgancc and backwardncss that has allowed this
country to dcgcrrerate into awar rrrongeringhypocrite. David, wcareat
war Today actual treedom ot‘ thought means iiccdom to question the
prevailing liberal- democratic post-ideological consensus— or it means
nothing" (Zizck, Resolution (it [he Card, 168) Perspective is important,
but wc Dhave a right to truth on the left, even if we arc surrounded by
“pselldoiildlcill academic Leftists. ,. [whose] own radicalism ultimately
amounts to an empty gestuic which obliges no one to do anythuig deﬁr
nire" (ziaek, Rear/noon rl/ t/ae Gate, 172). (I suppose at this point we
shorrld thank the ideologues orpostmodernism tor destroying academic
advocacy for m dung a political value judgment n‘olent Isn't it cute that
were all afraid of value judgments?!)

Your desire to see a truly communicative pohtical discourse belongs
to a bygone era This is serious business and the time rot passive dia-
logue has passed, it's time to push back Any "accepting"dialogue mat
reeks offaillue ridden baby-boomer bullshit just won't work at this point.
1 support gay marriage. I despise those who do not agree. Dialogue is
dead, And those oryou who are passively imtching the disintegrating
American lcrt ought to start shouting and scrcaining.This trend towards
the right is not reaching its peak, it’sjiist beginning, .. Flex your cerebele
lum. You all have power, otetcise it. David, ityou're truly are what you
proclaim to be. a righttrliinking Democrat, my suggestion is this: GET
OUT OF THE PARTY! You are a cancer on our cause. Join the left or
support the evil empire. binary logic is back. Marxism still provides the
meta-discourse that allows us to position and relate all partial narratives
and discourse (Jameson, Pas/madmirm orlbe Cu/mralLog‘rr afLaIe Capi-
ta/irm, 1991), Oops. . . did I anLlon Marx?! God forbid...
