Advice From The Dean

During the last month the Executive Councilofthe Faculty has

deliberated on matters of great importance; the faculty and
staff employment policy has received close scrutiny er a
number of new procedures for hiring are now underway,
and final decisions about faculty and department sizes for
next year are about to be made.

When he visited campus on September 11, Randall Morgan

made several recommendations to members of the Council
which were used, presumbably, as the basis for formulating
the new employment policy. Prior to President Leggett's
announcement at Monday’s faculty meeting, only inklings of
Morgan's recommendations and the alternative plans which
the Council considered were available to students or to most
ﬁculty members.

Decisions on faculty and department sizes for next year
have almost been made, and recruiting will begin during the
next month or so; at this point no information has been re-
leased by the Council, even about general proposals that
were discussed. The 5&3 has been trying to discover the
general lines of the Council's inquiry into this issue so our
readers may have some idea of what is being and has been
done; in this we have met with little success, because our
only source of information is the abridged minutes, which we
usually receive eight days after each meeting.

We hope that during the course of its discussions of faculty
and department size, all departments were consulted and
informed about policy recommendations affecting them.

However, to our knowledge no students were specifically cons
sulted (even confidentially) about whether certain programs
should or should not be offered or expanded.

When members of the College community as a whole are
not given a real opportunity to make recommendations for
policy decisions, whether that be because they lack infor
mation concerning the Council's activity or because} they
are not consulted for opinions, before beingfacedwith a fan ac

compli , the Council is not as likely to be presented with all or

most of the viewpoints and information they need to take
into account in making a sound decision.

On almost any issue, there are groups of faculty, students,
or staff who will disagree with the eventual decision; but the
Council would have more support and respect for its decisions
ifit‘hese groups were at least provided the opportunity to in
some way argue their cases in the course of Council debate.
To present effective suggestions, they would have to be aware
of the general substance of earlier discussions, and of the
alternatives the Council perceives.

To synthesize and evaluate additional suggestions that might
have been brought to the Council would involve extra work
for Council members; but membership on the Council wrries
with it considerable influence and the responsibility to make
every effort to see that the best possible decisions are
made.

The Councilmustnecessarily make somedecisions in complete
secrecy; ifit decides not to renewa faculty member’s contract,
this should not be opelily publicized, because it could unfairly
jeopardize his chances of finding employment elsewhere
for the next year. But there are issues where secrecy does
not seem necessary, where more complete information about
the Council's deliberations could be circulated. For example,
the recent deliberations which resulted in a new hiring and
recruitment procedure designed to increase the number of
black faculty at the College were shrouded in secrecy to an
extent that does not seem justifiable.

Beginning September ii, the 5&3 attempted to discover what
recommendations Randall Morgan had made and what dis
cussions were taking place in response. At its meeting
that day the Council had voted to release no information,
other than advance publication of a portion of its agenda,
until after the next Council meeting, when abridged minutes
would be approved for distribution to the faculty. At its
very next meeting, on September 15, the Councilrecommended
that the search committee be established. After all details
were worked out the policy was announced at last week’s
faculty meeting by President Leggett.

The course the Council chose to follow gave Dr. Morgan
a full opportunity to make his considered suggestions to
the Council, but members of the Grinnell Community were
not accorded that same privilege; it was eight days after the
September 15 meeting before even the fact that the Council
had adopted the new policy could be distributed to the faculty
and given to the S&B for publication. Even student govern-
ment leaders learned about the policy in the SlitB.

By keeping its actions almost t0tally secret until after final
decisions have been made, the Council prevents any critical
scrutiny of its procedure; no one can tell what alternatives
were considered or why a particular course was taken.

We recommend that the Council change its currentrestrictive
information policy, that it allowiin fact, encourage "its
members to inform faculty and students of their deliberations
and actions as they happen. Individual members can be guided
by the criteria originally suggested by Dean Wall at the first
Council meeting of the year: that they inform their constituents
about what the Council is doing but net reveal discussions
of individuals. We hope that the word "constituents" will be
taken broadly, to include all faculty and students.

Bulletins are out. Our cam-
pus is bcinginvadedthisweek-
end and next. This no hoax.
“Be prepared,” this is your
paranoid boy scout speaking.
We have no Conelrad Warm
ing System so the grapevine
will have to start swinging.

We have been given descrip‘
tions of the beings. They will
be clad homologously in Suns
day duds. The strange pens
dnnts on some of their necks
are ties. Most claim to be
wellemade windsors, but let's
avoid getting knotted up in
speci 'cs.

Others will sport oncrpiece
zoot suits which flairout from
their waists down. Many will
bear war paint on their faces.
Do nOt be alarmed at this,
but be wary of what might be
concealed under the former
garments.

The creatures will be unr
armed and are "relatively"

' harmless. Relatively because

some hostiles have been known
to sever past ties withthe col*
lege and others to take hos—
tages back home with them.
But these are the exceptions.
The visitors are classified
under species alumni andparr
enti. Their mission is only to
observe the classroom and
living conditions of us Grin-
nellings. Students have been
asked to extend common courr
tcsies (males may bow).
Students havealso beenasked
to be themselves and answer
any questions honestly. Hour
ever, some instances mightbe
better handled with some
quick - thinking discretion.
Here is Ben Doverbakwords
showing around two worried
parents and a nostalgic alums
nus.

Ben: Folks, this is the
forum, where students can re?
lax and interact while taking
a break from studying. On
weekends; dances, concerts,
lectures and other activities
are held here

Mrs. Chafe: What is that
racket from downstairs? it
sounds like pinball machines.
You know they're illegalin my
Stale.

Ben: Oh no mam. That’s our
duplex computer which inn
forms us of tilts in certain

n
lL of

surfaces,calculatcs velocity
and servesasaninstanlaneous
calculator. Almost everyone
in the school can operate it,
but it’s used mainly by a se-
lCct few. Mr. Magec, a polls
tical science profcssor, has
been known [0 doa lot of re-
search on it.

Mr. Fretenfuss: What’s that
up there? Those blacks look
like they’re planning some-
thing.

Ben: No sir. That’s ourpool
room. As I said, students go
there during their work
breaks. Let's takea quickwalk
around a part of our grounds.
1‘11 just show you a little of
the campus because we could
never cover the whole
grounds.

Mr. Long: Why’s that flagat
half-mast?

Ben: I’m halfrwhat? Oh, the
flag. I'm sorry sir, i wasn’t
paying "attention." That's,
uh, honoring the memory of
Mr. Khruschev.

Mr. Fretenfuss: Who?

Ben: Um, John Krewshank.
He was a police lieutenant in
Grinnell. He died of internal
revenosis while tracking down
a tax evader. That’s our li~
brary over there. We have
more books now than [hC archr
itects could have ever ima-
gined. That’s the women's
gym, Darby Gym, and the
Phys. Ed. Complex in the
background. ,

Mr. Long: New complex7 My
son graduated three yearsago
and they were supposedtohave
a new complex then.

Ben: Oh this one ismoreim—
proved and is now open. By the
way, aren’t you Hugo Long, the
famous Grinnell end? Our
team is just looking fine.

Mr. Long: i’ve heard you
don't draw crowds anymore?

Ben: That’s a misleading
statistic. Soccer games are
played at the same time and
as you know that sport has
really boomed. Whoever isn't
at the football game is assur-
edly out there watching socr
cer.

Mrs. Chafe: What's this OB
squad my son wants to join?

Ben: That’s a good point.
That in itself shows how foota
ball interest has skyrocketed.
The OB squad is a student

Mr. Frctenfuss: What does

backfield, Let me show you
my dorm. This is Mears Hall,
the oldest dorm at Grinnell.

Mr. Long: To me it will
always be girls territory.

Mrs. Chafe: It says here
that it still is a girls’ dormi-
tory. Why are boys going in
and out?

Ben: That must be a typo»
graphiml error. This is ac-
tually a coed dorm. It is
amazing how conducive coed
living can be with studying.
Here's Bill, my roommate.
He’s been working on an in-
dependent project with a girl
for a few days now.

Mr. Fretenfuss: What did
he mean when he asked if you
had his ”stuff?"

Ben: I picked up his mail

this morning. We always pass
around the joint responsibilr
ities. i think you've seen an
overview of dorm life. I’ll
meet you forbreakfast tomor-
row. Don't bother calling me.
I’m never on my floor in the
morning. I get up early and
jog.
The alumni will be here this
weekend and the parents next.
This weekend will serve as a
dry run. Only about lZSalumr

ents allege to have a cast of
thousands. Be en garde and
remember they won't shoot
till they see the whites of
your lies.
