Along with the festivities of 10/10 came a night
ofarson, disorderly conduct, a hospitalization and are
rests. According to Directoi of Security Steve Biiscoe
and Police Chrcf Jody Matherly, the iright was busy
for law enforcement

“From the seventh to the ninth, our log had 19
calls," said Briscoe. “Some weekends we'll have three
or four, sortie eight or nine It was an active weekend.
We had everything from fire alarm calls to arson to
disorderly conduct to propertvdamage, thefts, sick
calls, alcohol calls, alcohol overdoses [and] poison-
in s,

gThe number of incidents ofﬁcially reported for
10/10 included two arsons, six fire alarms, one hospir
talization, one date rape drug use and thiee arrests.

According to police reports, Edgar Paul Her»
rington '08 and Kale Drange, a weekend visitor, were
taken into custody by several ofﬁcers following the
discovery ofillegal activity. Neither Drangt: nor Her-
rington was willing to comment.

“I had a
couple extra
ofﬁcers on
that night
and then two
of them de-
cided just to
walk across
campus, which we do generally, you know, just to see
how big the crowd was or what we might need," said
Mathcrly “That’s initially what put them on campus
wasjust taking a walk through the open areas, the side
walks and stumblc across a few individuals smoking
marijuana right out in the open."

Mathcrly said the arresting ofﬁcers were dressed
in plain clothes. The attire of the officers arresting
Herrington and orange load to rumors ofundcrcovcr
police. According to Matherly, the ofﬁcers were eonr
ducting a routine walkrthrough.

"Students need to know we occasionally walk
through campus,” said Mathcrly. ‘ch ride bicycles
through campus."

John Ayling'os was arrested in Main Hall. He was
taken into custody by a uniformed officer under the
charge of willful interference with an investigation.

“Essentially, the reason I was arrested was the
police asked me to leave the hallway and I said no,"
Ayling said. “I was angry with the officers for raid—
ing my friend's room and violating our privacy and i
didn't know at the time they had a warrant to search
the room."

Ayling is facing a charge of willfully disrupting an
investigation, and plans on pleading not-guilty.

Herrington, Drange and Ayling were all booked
and released with promises to appear in court.

“Generally we don’t have to make arrests, but this
year, in my opinion, itwas starting to probably get out
ofconttol," said Marhcrly.

The occurrences on the night of 10/10 have led to
concern over the future of the party.

“I think 10/10 is a great tradition and I’d hate to
see it go," said Ayling, "but I do think that students
still need to be careful that they don’t abuse substanc-
es in a way that endangers their own health or gets
them in trouble with the law.”

Administrators criticize 10/ 10

av DAVID MONTGOMERY

1n the days leading up to thc campusrwidc 10/10
party on Oct. 8, Dean for Student LifeJen Krohn met
with the party organizers and SGA to ensure that the
party would not get out of hand. Three weeks later.
Krohn and Vicerpresident for Student Services Ton-i
Crady said that this year’s party was “problematic.”
Three arrests were made and one student was hos-
pitalized.

Before the party, Krohn learned that there would
be illegal drugs at the party. She would not disclose
her source. “When we get information that there's
going to be drugs on campus, we tell the police,” she
said, adding that the college is subject to strict federal
anti-drug laws. “IfGrinnell doesn't
follow federal drug law, we can lose
federal funding," she said,

Police also received one of the
ﬂyets advertising 10/10 before [he
event and were aware that alcor
hol would be served. “Pretty much
any party that gets posted, we get
a copy of it," said Grinnell Police
Chief Jody Mathcrly. “If it's a largc party we want
to be prepared to handle things," he said.

Grinnell College has one ofthe most liberal alcOr
hol policies among colleges in the country, since beer
is served at ofﬁcial campus parties. “When the Feds
changed the drinking agc back in the eighties, we
decided to take a pretty liberal approach to drinking
on campus," said Crady. “We didn‘t want students to
drink and drive.We didn‘t wantstudents to not report
[other students' alcohol poisoning]. Overall,wc've cn-
joyed a pretty good period where studcurs have bccn
very responsible."

Crady,wlio is in charge ofcollcgc alcohol and par»
ty proccdurcs, said that ho isn't considering changing
the alcohol policy at this timc. He said that next ycar
he will work with students “to come up with a clear
set ofstrategies for managing this party."

SGA President John Bohman ’06 said that he
thought the party, which was organized by tho Ulti-
mate Frisbee team, was reasonably successful. “None

”/n any big party, incidents
always happen.”

of the incidents happened at any of the parties, other
than the fire alarms,” he said. Hospitalizations were
low. In any big party, incidents always happen. There
was a really organized coordinated and sustained cfr
fort on the party organizers ’side."

Richard West ’06, one of the organizers of 10/10,
agreed that the party was organized to run smoothly
and safcly. “We had several people that weren't drinkr
ing at all, cleaning, making sure that people weren’t
destroying things and helping out people who were
sick," he said.

Krohn‘t'elt that students could go further. “l per
sonally would like to see greater structure and greater
commitment to our policy," she said. “Do I want to

bring in folks to have a major
crackdown? Nobody enjoys that."

The oﬁ‘icial rules require that
alcohol not be carried outside.
Shots and bottles of alcohol are
banned. Illegal drugs and under
age drinking are also prohibited
by federal law. Food and lion-al-
coholic beveragcs were provided

at each location.

Crady said that he thinks that while the average
party at Grinnell has not bcconrc more disruptive,
10/10 is an outlier that is becoming more problemat-
ic. The last time the college alcohol policy was rcvrscd
followed a year in which there were over 20 alcohol
overdoses, which he said forced him to take action.
“Are we at that point at the moment? I don’t think so,"
Crady said, “Does 10/10 concern me? A great deal."

Bohman said that student leadership cant make
policy changcs rhat would really affect partying. If
the SGA comes in and says you cant do this, [stu-
dents] are going to do what they want to, he said.
“Where we bhave influence is in persuasion.”

Crady and Krohn want leadership from students,

“When we have to pick up the pieces from the
parts of parties that don't go well, we have a rough
time with that," said Krohn. "It's not ﬁin, it's not the
part ofourjob we enjoy."
