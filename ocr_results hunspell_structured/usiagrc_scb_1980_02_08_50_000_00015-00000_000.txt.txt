of recapturing our rightiui glory. our
Iirst move should be in the Middle
East. From one end to the other, the
Crescent of Crisis has been more trour
ble than it's worth: Soviet troops in
Aighanistan, anti-American hostility
and fifty hostages in Teheran; brutal
sexual abuse of the Kurds in Turkey
and Iraq; escalating oil prices and
unstable supplies in the Persian Gulf;
threats to world peace in the Arab
Israeli conflict. We don't have to put
up with any of this anymore; it's time
to send the Marines in and teach those
towelheads a lesson. If the inhabitants
of the region can't coexist and pump
oil peaceiuliy, we'll just have to run
things ourselves. Even if we have to
sacrifice the hostages in order to save
them, it will be more than worth it to
get our hands on that Oil. America

Drop oil, not bombs

To the editor: I have heard a lot about
America's “leadership” roles in the
world. I have discovered one of our
leadership roles. We lead in the areas
of waste and irresponsibility with
natural resources, We have all heard
the statistics: 6% of population, 30% of
resources; 25 to 50% more energy us-
ed per dollar 01 domestic goods pro-
duced; 40 to 50% of our energy
wasted: et cetera.

But I don't hear much about this
wasteful role. Instead I hear that we
Wlll assert our national resolve, that
we have regained our nerve, that we
will protect our national interests. We
will tight [or oil, as the headlines say.

This sort of insanity was foolish
before, it is suicide now. If we fight in
the Persian gulf for our oil, it will be
World War III. Period It is absurd to
believe a war between the Sonet
Union and the United States could be
won by either side, Even Harold
Brown, the Secretary n: Defense, ad-
mits that. At best it would be a meat
grinder war that would make the war
in Vietnam look like a Clear cut affair,
and at worst it would be the war that
destroys the Western world and all its
peoples.

The lesson seems clear to me: we
must lead the world in an energy cut-
back. Now is the time to ration gas.
Now is the time to make home and
business insulating mandatory, Now is
the time to force people's thermostats
down. Now is the time to put the oil
companies in their place Now is the
time to cut our oil consumption by «to
to 50%, Now, If we do this and suc~
ceed, we will really be the greatest
and strongest nation on earth. We will
be the America that is no longer
blackmailed and coerced because of
