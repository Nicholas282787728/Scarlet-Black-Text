Blue Book Accepts Novel
Penned By Langan Sop]:

Last week one more Crinnellian
joined the ranks of the purse-
string literary, as "Close Com-
hat", a hook~length novel by
Robert Bliss, Langan sophomore,
found it’s way into printers ink.

Now in the hands or the M0
Call corporation's Blue Book, mp
adventure magazine for men. his
story is awaiting publication. The
story deals with five men from
live different regions of the
United States, and with the event-
ful 72 hours they spent together
during the war in action on the
border of Germany.

“The story is built not only
around their actions but around
their thoughts and varying phil»
osophies," Bliss said. It shows
how war brought the men to-
gether and how they as Ameri-
cans were alike in most respects.
