At 9 pm. that evening, the duo performed
in Bob's Underground Café. “Will: the afternoon
workshop focused on a case rrred in Massachu-
setts over so years ago, their eoneert featured
songs on more reeent political issues in the U st,
North and South Korean. Nigcria and other
countries.

Songs like "The Twelve Days ofInvasion" (set
to the rune of“Thc Twelve Days ofChristmax")
and the “Dr. Laura Polka” drew big laughs from
the mides=ms Bob's crowd,
