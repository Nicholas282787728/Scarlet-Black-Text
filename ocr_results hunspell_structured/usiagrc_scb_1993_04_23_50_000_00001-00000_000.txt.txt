Grinnell Relays Reborn

“Prohibition and Temperance” theme
pokes fun at alcohol policy

by Jim Kropa

 

 

rises from the ashes.
The outdoor event will be held all day long on Mac Field.
in the warmth of the Iowa springtime sun.

“The idea of an all-day spring event is appealing,” said senior Ben
Wohlauer. He and senior Matt Landahl, grass roots organizers of the
resurrected Relays, hope that they will become a more lasting tradition
than Peace Day. last year‘s SGA Carnival or the Keg Races.

“[The Keg Races] only occurred once in their full glory. We‘re
trying to get back to the original spring event," said Wohlauer.

In the spirit ofthose vintage Relays, begun as a parody ofthe Drake
Relays, Landahl said that there an opening ceremony and the lighting of
an eternal ﬂame. A “Parade of Champions" through the dorms is
planned for 1:00 pm. tomorrow, with a band to wake people up and
remind them of the afternoon festivities.

The afternoon will continue with a huge picnic followed by the
games. Borrowing an idea from last year’s popular Grinnell Games.
Wohlauer and Landahl have asked the SEPCS to organize departmental
teams to compete.

Political science professor Wayne Moyer,who played acentral role
in organizing the annual Grinnell Relays since they were first held in
1973 until Grinnell Relays XV in 1987, collaborated with Landahl and
Wohlauer to enhance the 1993 revival. Wohlauer called Meyer the
“guru" oflhetrztditional Grinnell Relays,andMoyeris scheduled togive
an opening speech at 1:45. prior to the lighting of the etemal ﬂame.

Landahl made a distinction between tomorrow's relays and past
events. “A big problem we‘ve run into is people have been seeing the
signs and asking ‘Is this the Keg Races?m Landahl said. “It's not the Keg
Races because we’re trying to keep it as legal as we possibly can.”

He and Wohlauer accept that the new alcohol policy resurcts some
of the activities that they are planning. “We can’t, obvtously with the
drinking age, have sixty kegs 0n the field like they did in the past,"
Landahl admitted.

Eearingtheirlimitationsin mind,Wohlauerartdl_andahl have chosen
a“prohibition and temperance" theme for the Relays in an attempt to mock
the alcohol policy. “instead of trying to be sly," Wohlauer said.

Not to worry, however, since a Harris Center party “with actual
beer” will be held tomorrow night following the afternoon games.

Seniors Wohlauer and Landahl hope that a younger generation of
Grinneli students will be inspired to continue the Grinnell Relays into
the future. “We’rejust looking to plan some event that will make the end
of our senior year enjoyable,” Wohlauer said,

Landahl isconfident that they will be successful. “This isjustgoing
to be the best day of the year," he said.
