Faculty and students dzcry Osgood

We the undersigned ivrite as Grii iellians dedicated to free
inquiry and the ope ‘ L;\C}i1|ngc of ideas, as faculty members and
students united i promoting Grinneli College's core values of
excellence in a liberal education, diversity, and social responsin
bility.

Last fall, a group of faculty meiiibcrs wrote first to the
Board ofTrustees, and then to the scarlet 8; Black to protest
what they considered a grave i justice done to a member of
our communityThis protest was quickly diverted by allegations
that the protesting faculty were acting inappropriately one
faculty member was issued a ccaser nd~dcsist order. President
Osgood appeared to confirm these allegations in an interview
in the scarlet ocBlacir, and the Board ofTrustees announced to
the entire community that faculty members protesting injustice
were guilty ofcultivating “a rift between students and members
of the administration"

As the number of concerned faculty increased, President
Osgood agreed to rescind the ceascraiid—desist letter, thereby
affirming the principle of freedom of speech on campus, The
president also agreed to publicly address allegations of faculty
misconduct and voice his support of the faculty. In his two
drafts of this stiUtunpublished statement, however, the presie
dent could not bring himself to affirm that no faculty miscon-
duct had occurred. Why? Because, he explained, he had not
investigated the charges and would not investigate them, Cone
cerned faculty and the president reached an impasse: the faculty
sought his support and he could not give it. subsequently, the
chair ofthc faculty spoke on this issue in an official meeting of
the faculty, stating that there was not strong evidence to sup-
port thesc allegations. To this day. President Osgood has not
issued the promised public letter of support—though he has
continued to contribute a column for the scarlet & Black (the
“RKO Corner"). .

We the undersigned are profoundly disappointed that
President Osgood has participatcd in a strategy that blames the
messenger for delivering bad news.Thcre are genuine problems
on this campus, and they need to be discussedThe administra-
tion‘s strategy of besmirching the reputation of concerned {36
ulty membeis does not make those problems go away, it simply
threatens a traditionally strong relationship between the faculty
and students ofthis college, sowing fear and disrrustwhen what
we need most is encouragement to speak freely with one an-
other and to speak otir against injustice.

The tcnacity with which the admin ttarinn continues to
avoid transparency and accountability in its practices only un-
derscores the need for candid discussion on campus. We call
upon President Osgood and his administration to commit to
the very principles of free inquiry and the open exchange of
ideas that have been threatened by its actions this yet .

Response from the No Limits Preject

Last week, the No Limits Ptojccr was given a copy of the
same document the editors ofthc 5&13 receivedThe contents
of the document shocked and saddened us. As we saw at the
open forum last semester and as this document shows, our
community remains divided and mistrustful. Questions must
be answered and action must be taken to assure something
egregious as this docs not happen again at Grinnell College.
Only by increasing transparency and accountability between
the administration, faculty and students can we rebuilding
trusting relationships.

We, the No Limits Project, would like to underscore the
lack of accountability at this institution between the rhetoric
used for the marketing ofthc college and the reality on campus.

We find a pressing need for the admii 'stration to respond to
our demands. As tht issue ofthc 5&3 shows, the h ng and
firing practices of this College are not m-line with our core
values. By responding to our demand foi a full and independent
review ofstaffhiring and fir g procedures, the administration
can start to work with the campus community to mend the
problems that have risen and will persist due to a lack ofrranse
potency.

We do not think it coincidental that this lack of dialogue
between the students, faculty and administrators comes at the
same time so many ofout stated commitments to our core val-
“€57social responsibility, diversity and, consequently, cxcclr
lence in educationitirc being ignored. Reading the document
reported on by the soda has only strengthened out determina-
tion to meet with the administration to addrcss our demands.
We want Grinnell to be the institution it markets itselfas,We
hope all community inclnb‘cmismdelirs, faculty and staff—
can help us work to meet that goal.

This is why we have invited President Osgood and all of
the Vice Presidents ofthe College to meetwith us in a public-
fish—bowl style mccting open to the whole campus. While we
welcome the opportunity to meet in person with the admins
isttators to talk about our demands, the No Limits Project is
meant to be a transparent dialogue and we refuse to have these
conversations bchind the closed doors of our administrators oft
fices,

Clarifications about No Limits Project

We would like to clear up some questions raised by the op
ed “Sketchy pe oning being done by the No Limits Project."
First, it was never the intention of the No Limits Project to
carry out a “bait and switch'loperation. Although the columns
author suggests that he was not fully informed of the full scope
of the project by the student who approached him, we have
received few other complaints about this happening, Every stue
dent who was collecting signatures for the project was doing so
on a packet—the first two pages were a iicxrtfinal draft ofthc
letter and 14 demands, and the third page was left blank for
signatures.The snidcnts who signed put their names at the end
ofthc document with cach demand listed explicitly.

so while we iegrct that this happened at all and apologize
to those who feel they've been manipulatedwc would also note
that basic responsibility, and principles of self governance, re
quite that one read, research and understand what one signs.
Additionally, had any students felt misled by the petition. g
proecss, they were (and still are) able to remove their names
from the online list simply by e-iuailing the No Limits Project
email account.

Greg Hudson: initial request to be iemoved from the list
was initially overlooked, but when he sent a follow—up email
four days later, his nainc was immediately icmovcdiwc are not
hold ig those names hostageAnd while approximately 15 stir
dcuts have removed their names from the No Limits Petition,
about 100 more students have added their names in the past
month. We apologize to those who did not understand what
they were signing and thank the 300 people who are commit-
ted to the campaign.

Additionally, we would like to clarify what is meant when
the No Limits Project describes itself as non»1ucmrcillcal. First,
it should not be taken to mean that .111300 people who signed
the list have been equally involved—we recognize that students
will be involved to various degrees. Rather, nontlncmrchical
simply means that we don't have leaders or assigned roles, in
contrast to most student organizations on campus, In practice,
anyone should be able to come to our meetings, be heard, and

have theiropinions taken into account—the NLP tries to arrive
at a consensus before making decisions, without giving more
or less weight to people's opinions based on their previous int
volvement
Finally, to clarify about the 30 student contacrsi30 was an
arbitrary number agreed upon at an open meeting ofstudcnts
to whom the Pre ents, Deans and Trustees could direct offi-
cial correspondcnce.This was a volunteer role, so the 30 student
contacts are basically the first 30 signatories who volunteered,
with some consideration by the entire group given to class year.
Emphatically, no “preeitisting group oflcnders"chosu them, and
the only role they play is to receive responses from the original
lcttcr's addressees.

Follow the Grmnell mission statement

According to Grinncil’s mission statement, “The College aims
to graduate women and men who can think ~learly . .who can
evaluate criticauy both their own and others ideas, and who are
prepared in life and work to use their knowledge and their abilities
to serve the common good."1i\ short, we aim to educate critin
cal citizens, who can discriminate between truth and lie, who do
not tolerate bigotry and political sopoiihcs, and who will use their
critical thinking skills to ensure that political discourse progresses
rationauy and fairly. such aims are not only noble, bur absolutely
vital, when dealing with issues as urgent and heavily contested as
the lstae -Palcstinian conflict.

This conflict is particularly difficult to discuss constructively
because, all too ofren,dialoguci , peded by those who refuse to
engage They present one-sided points oivicw, emotional appeals,
and accusing laligungcﬂbiise ofthc tcrm al‘irFSCInixism comes
to mindipmclscly in order to halt debate.

A casein point is Grinnell's ieccnt visitor, Maurice Roumani
oflstaclls Benecurion University of the Negev l—lis opinions offer
a slanted perspective marred by racial and religious generalizations
and glaring double standards, By refusing to recognize wellnestabe
lished facts lying outside of his imagined narrative where lsiam
and Arab nationalism are entirely to blame for the conflict, hc
haltcd critical discussion ofthc issue. students ought to be able to
recognize his behavior for what it was: cynical refusal to help ﬁnd
a just and equitable peace to the conflict,

The philosopher Hannah Arendt wiete in "Bcrwccn Past and
Punirc,"“ir is only by respecting its own borders that [the political]
realm, where we are free to act and to change, can remain intact,
preserving its integr ty and keeping its promises "Truth establisht
as these borders: “it is the ground on which we stand and thc skv
that stretches above us,"Thts tnith is not limited to a single pe
speetive. it does not support the easy, racist logic of the Maurice
Roumanis ofthc world, in Arendt's account, the academy is one of
several instinitions established precisely to preserve truth and thus
sustain the space for pub 'dclibcmrion and action.

we take this charge so ousiy, and so we feel the need to ad
dress what ive think is a distinct failure ofthc college to educate
global citizens who can think clearly and critically about the Is
raeliePaiesrinian conflict. specifically, our issue is with the lack of
productive debate and academic courses as well as the silence of
(nirrminded Grinncll faculty on this topic.

Moreover, we wonder why Chaluwjm would invite Roumani,
a member of the overtly polemical Israel on Campus Coalition,
and whether his views are synonymous with Chalutzim's.

As an issue that affects this country's foreign policy agenda
and domestic political discourse and as an issue of justice, the
IsncirPalcsuniim conflict merits rational, fair, and sufficient di
cussion on our campus.
