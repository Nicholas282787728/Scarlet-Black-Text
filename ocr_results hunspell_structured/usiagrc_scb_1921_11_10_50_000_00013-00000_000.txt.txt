Word has rebently been received

teaching English\i\n the P rtel‘ Bliddle
School, at TechowJ‘Shahtung, China.
Decker was active in many phases of
college work while in Grinnelli

"1 am wonderingso many things
about Grinhell and things Grinnellian.
I suppose we had the usual crop at
night of the General. 1 am wondering
gullible freshmen and good looking

how many or the old men arc back and ,
what the prospect are for a success
iul year in football. or course it is
too soon to expect mail written since
the opening or school but I assure you
I am anxiously awaiting it.

"You might be interested in hear-
ing a. bit about the trip I had in get~
ting here. It took ﬁve weeks and live
days from the time I left home and I i
enjoyedevery minute of it immensely.
I took the Rock Island to Colorado
Springs and dropped oft in Grinnell
and Des Moines for short visits. At
Colorado Springs I did all of the usuo

al stunts from going thru the “Cave.

or the Winds" to climbing Pike's
Peak in a snow storm. From there i
took the n & R. G, down tbru the
Royal Gorge, stopping ofi‘ at Sands,
(2010., and taking the narrow gauge
over the tamons Marshall Pass and
down the Black .Canon ot the Gunni-
son River, I had just time‘ enough in
salt Lake city to take a "rubber neck
wagon" trip to see the dormitory (or
should I say Quadrangle?) Brigham
Young built to house his numeorus
family in and so did not get to go out
to the famous “Saltaiim Bathing
Beach. From Salt Lake I went to
San Frtzncisco Lhrl! the Feather River
Canon on the Western Pacific road
and tho I saw the river by moonlight
I am sure it did not lose any charm

thereby. Perhaps the best part of myl

trip was three days spent ill the Yose-
mite National Park.

"I sailed out thru the Golden Gate
along in the early arternoon of Aug-
ust 23 01:1 the Steamship “Shillyo

Life on an ocean steamer is a sort of
continual pleasure resort and between
indoor baseball games, swimming, and
dancing, not to mention reading, the
time missed very quickly and pleas
antiy. Perhaps the most fun or anything
we did on the boat was the 00s
tiinie ball at which I appeared as a
college freshman.

“The boat stopped long enough in
Honolulu to let us tour the island and
to go surf hathing on the famous Wai—
kiki beach. We landed in Yokohama,
Japan on September 3 and as I could
not get passage for shanghai I was
forced to do the much nicer alter-
native or going the all railroad route
across Japan to Shimonoseki; (hence
by ferry to Fusau, Korea, and rail
again from there to Soeul, Mukdeu,
and Peking. This gave be a chance

of Japan but Korea and north China

butsu Buddha is; I went close by the
famous Mt. hiji and for miles travel-
led along Japan's heautitnl Inland Sea.
It was a ﬁve day trip I shall never
forget. Inst Sunday I spent in Pek—
ing where I was entertained by Rev,
E. w. Cross‘s brother, I nnally are
rived here at Techow last Monday
night, the nineteenth.

“My work here will he to teach
English in Che boys school and to su-
pervise the physical training and ath-
letic work. I have live classes, three
advanced ones in which the boys speak
very good English and two beginning
classes in which about the only com-
mon modes of expression between
their lack or English and my lack of

take their work so seriously and try
so hard to get things right that I havc

Five Letter Men Back and Many
other ,Strong Candidates—
’Change Schedule.

_With four letter men in basketball
and with a strong bunch of contenders
for varsity berths from among last
year’s freshman squad and others now
in school, it is possible to predict some
great possibilities tor the Pioneer bas-
ketball squad or 1921-22.

The letter men back include captain»
clect Willis Macy, '22, who played a
strong game at guard last year and
should be in top form this fall; Ray
Fearing, ’23, last year's center; Fred
Benz, '23, who made a place lor him—
self on the squad, at forward, as soon
as he was eligible in the second semes-
ter, and Dwight Garner, '23, who has
been out of school for a time. In ad—
dition to these letter men those letter
men those irom the varsity squad are
Nelson Whitehill, '23, torward; Lau—

track I think we have some pretty
good prospects and will tiy to arrange
some meets with a neighboring school
next spring.

"0n arriving hero I was most hap-
pily impressed with the work. It is a
far stronger and better established
station here in Techow than I had
realized. The campus covers about
40 acres and alter Chinese fashion it
ls surrounded by an impressive wall
and on the inside is further suh»wall-
ed between the different divisions, All
or the buildings are of the same grey
colored brick and more or less of the
same architecture which really makes
quite an impressive showing. There
is a very good looking and well equip-
ped hospiml which comes ﬁrst in ord-
er, then tha girls school central
building with the dining hall and dor-
mitories back or that Our boys
school with its main building and two
dormitories in on the far side or the
campus. Between the two schools are
the six very ﬁne residences where the
different families of doctors and teach-
ers live. I am staying with the Mac»
Eachrons,

"The people are all so friendly and
cordial that I feel quite at home air
ready, indeed the atmosphere here is
a good deal like that in an American
college community. NW

“Give my very best regards to all
my friends

rcnec Janasen. '23, guard; and Wil-
liam Herbrechtsmeyer, '22, forward.

Among the possible contenders icr
varsity positions from former stars
new in school are Smith, Crichett,
Prchh, and Herbrechtsmeyer, as well
as Datesman, Baker, McLain, John—
ston and others from the freshman
squad last year.

Have First Iiractice.

The gridiron is claiming the majority
or the varsity men but early basket—
ball practice has been in progress tor
about three week‘s and many of the
men are beginning to round into shape,
with prospects and old men working
hard on the rudiments of the game.
Thus far the work has been chietly
conﬁned to passing altho there has
been a little general floor work. The
early workouts are bringing out and
developing new material that is bound
to cause keen competition in varsity
circles as soon as Coach "Bud" Saun-
ders dismisses his football men NOr ’
vember 24.

Change Schedule Form.

The Missouri Valley athletic direc-
tors have changed the plan or compe-
tition that has been formerly followed
and the double round robin form of
schedule has been adopted: that of
having every team in the valley appear
for one game at every other school.
The new style of schedule, while it
will increase the expenses of the Val-
ley schools, has many decided advan—
tages. By giving the fans at every
school an opportunity to witness each
team in the conierence in action, inter—
est in the game will be increased and
enthusiasm will be greater, the direc-
tors bclieve. At the end of the season
the student body or each school is to
be given an opportunity to vote on on
All-Valley team, and will be in a posi-
tion to do this from having seen each
squad in action.

Another advantage of the new sys-
tem is that it will eliminate any argu-
ments about the holders of the Valley
championship. In past years it has
been impossible for every team to play
every other one, and this has caused
dispute as to clear title to ﬁrst honors
in several cases.
