Scoring was frequent during the
entire first hall, which ended 25 to

was much closer and more hotly con—
tested in the second period, the Flor
neers outpointing the Filter: in this
half, 8 to 7. Both Quintets \vi‘re better
at the guarding elements or the game,
but the early advantage gained by the
visitors could not be overcome and
the contest ended in favor of the lat.

Edge was the best on the offensive
tor the Pioneers, scoring four tield
goals and one free throw. Capt. Bcnz

LITTLE OLD NEW YORK.”

Mitrion Davies will have a role en-
tlrely diitcrent from anything in which
she has heretofore appeared and one
exactly suited to her appealing per-
sonality when she appears as Patricia
O’thy in “Little Old New York,” at
the Strand theatre soon. The roguish,
mischievous traits of Princes Mary
Tudor, played by Miss Davies in
“When Knighthood Was in Flower,"
are round in little Patricia, but there
is also a quality of wistful pathos
which shows a new side or Miss me
ries’ dramatic ability. The role of
Patricia has something or the char-
acter or Maude Adams' “Feter Pan"
or of "Little Lord Fauntleroy" about

Miss Davies appears most or the
time as a young boy, having donned
thisl disguise in order to inherit a for-
tune.

“Little Old New York" was adapted
to the screen by Luther Reed from the
stage play by Rida Johnson Young
which had 9. most successful run on
Broadway. Joseph Urban designed

the settings which recreate the quaint

picture. A cast which even surpasses
thztt of “When Knighthood Wits in

Flower" in which Miss Davies scored
such a tremendous success, adds lustre
to "Little Old New York."
