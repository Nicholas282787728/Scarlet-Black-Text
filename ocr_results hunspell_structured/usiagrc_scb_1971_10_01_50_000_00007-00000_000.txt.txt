French Senior Teaches Classes

Catherine Navone is in the

unique position of being bOth
a Grinnell tcaclierand studcnt.
While on!y staying for one
semester, she helps to teach
seven hours Of French clan
sses, records French tapes
and is available to all stU’
dents for assistance in writ
ten and spoken French.

Presently, Catherine is a
fourth-year sttidcntatthe Uni*
versity of Nice. Her field of
Interest is English and Anglo
\merican Studies, with spe-
Cialization in American Sm"
dies. She hopes that her stay
here will expose her to Ame
crican culture and improve
her fluency in English.

Because the fourth year at
a French University is pri-
marily independent study, it
is a particularly good year
to go abroad. However, Ca-
therine still receives written
material in the mail from
the University of Nice for her
study.

While at Grinnell, Catherine
is attending Mr. Irving' se-
minar on Pastoral Tradition
in America and is arranging
two independent study projects

of twentieth century America.
She is living iii Loose Hall.

Miss Navone observes that
in comparison with the Frr
ench University educational
system, Grinnell College al-
lows for much more flexir

bility. At a French Univer
sity, the major field of study
must be chosen duringtlie first
year, and the set program for
each field of study is deman-
ding. Students must also take
a second foreign language and

French; and unless the SKU’
dent is extremely mpable, he
does n0t find time to take
courses outside his field.

Catherine has command of
four languages, due to her
background.

In addition to French and
English, she is fluent in Ita-
lian and has a good knowr
ledge of German. Her knoWr
lodge of English acquired at
school was reinforced by two
summer vacations she spent
in England. The Italian comes
from her father, who was
originally an Italian citizen.
His letters to her are writ
ten in Italian because Cath-
crine wants to maintain her
fluency.

Not content With four lanr
guages, Catherine wants to
learn Still more. Catherine
also wants to travel and so
has decided to make teaching
her career since it offers Corr
tact withpeople and leaves
free time for travel.
Catherine concluded by 52:7
ying she enjoys teaching at
Grinnell because she finds
that the students want to lea-
rn and are enthusiastic about

aspeaking French. Even stu-

dents not taking French cou-
rses she says, seem to like
to converse with her in
French. _

Women’s Group
Finds Money

After trying two years to
get funds, the Women‘s Mover
merit on campus has received
$1600 this yearto obtain spear
kers, buy literature, and in
general sponsor "activities
women want on campus."

President Leggett, Dean
Walker, and Dean Wall each
contributed $400 from their
contingency funds to the Move
ment, after recognizing the
group officially and their need
for funds. The remaining $400
is from the Roberts Lecturer
ship fund and can only beused
to pay for speakers. The other
$1200 has no restrictions on
how it can be spent.

As the need for funds arises,
public meetings will be held
so students can express their
opinions on how the money
should be spent.

Terry Clifford, a member of
the Movement, said, “This
money is really anetnergency
fund set up for this year. Next
year we willbe under the regu~
lar campus program. In addir
tion to recognition andmoney,
the school has also given us a
room in the new RE. build-
ing, though we can‘t use it
until the complexis finished.”

The committee which will
handle the funds include Pam-
ela Charney, Terry Clifford,
Sarah Gewanter, Margret
Hoffman, Judy Kreissman and

is interested. Men are not

factor preventingwomen from
freely expressing their ideas
and problems.

But men are not completely
excluded from this important
area. The men at Grinnell
have established a group mor
deled after the nationally 101*
own Chicago group, Men For
Cool. The object of this group
is to discuss and try tounder-
stand the roles that men as
sume in our society.

The women's group has been
active in Grinnell for 55V.
eral years but it has only
gained official recognition this
year. With so many peo l ‘
volved in the group activi es,
it appears that Grinnell will
be greatly affected by the dyr
namic ideas and reforms they
are trying to enact.

Mezvinsky

Ed Mezvinsky, an unannounced candidate for Congress, will
be at Grinnell next Tuesday under the sponsorship of the
Program in Practical Political Education (PPPE). _

The appearance, scheduled at 4:15 Tuesday in South Lounge,
is the first in the series of political visitors PPPE would
like to present to discuss the role of youth in politics. In
this connection, local high school students will be invited to
attend.

Mezvinsky will probably be a candidate for First District
Congressman in the 1972 elections. He was narrowly defeated
by Congressman Schwengel in 1970, but (hS district has since
been changed, by removing one heavily Republican county and
adding Poweshiek County, where the race was very close be
tween the Republican and Democratic candidates in 1970.
This, combined with the new 19*year-old vote, may havea
significant impact on the first district race.

Mezvinsky is a former member of the Iowa House, where
he was outspoken on environmental issues. He has long been
againSt the VietrNam War, and is considered to be an active
and hard campaigner.

Congressman Schwengel has also been invited to visit the
campus.

blems. Only one was drugr oriented.

At the moment the Revolving Door is selecting new staff

the session, and plan to include workshops with professional
people.

The center is presently manned by a board of directors
