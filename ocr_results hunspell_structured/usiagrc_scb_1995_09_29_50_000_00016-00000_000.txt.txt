The Cherry Orchard

STAFF WRITER

Following the auditions last
week, director Ellen Mease was very
excited about the prospects for the
play “Cherry Orchard," written by
Chekov.

“The quality of auditions was
extraordinarily high," said Mease.
'l'heresultingcastis“A mixofpeople
with strong theater experience and
the self—confident. buoyant encrg'
needed tosustainaplay iilte thisover
the two liours ofpetfotmance time."

Drama personnel on campus in.
iluenced the choice of play, Mease
explained. “The theater department
realizes we have a group of actors and
actresses particularly skilled in con—
necting and listening to one anoth»

er. which is the real bottom line in
'Cherry Orchardm

StagemanagerBridgldRielly'96,
added “Cherry orchard is iust such
a huge dramatic endeavor, it's neces.
sary to have really experienced and
accomplished actors.”

Half the cast worked together
on the Medieval Cycle plays and the
other halfwas in “Much Ado About
Nothing" last year,

Juniors Carolyn Macctillough.
Emily Bergl, and Joe Haynes, as well
as seniors Michael Hicks and Matt
Welch, all have maior roles. Rachel
Farris ‘96 iyill play the lead role or
Lyubov. Nick Hartshorn is the only
firstyear in the Cast, Farris said the
difficulty inplaying Lyobov“isshe's
extremely dramatic but she still has
to be real."

SO cute I thought I would puke. Not
that it wasn’t a good movie, it just
gave meacase orthe dry heaves One
thing that happens that you won't
expect, however, is Meg Ryan and
Tim Robbins being upstaged by a
bunch of old guys. I don‘t know all
their names, but the three bungling
professors are hysterical, and easily
steal the show. I won’t ruin the end«
ing. but Robbins gets the chick. but
has to give her up when his ex girlr

Marlon Brando, whom he never knew

quite live up to its potential. You sort
of have to use your imagination to

The scenes are often awkward and
the film doesn't bring enough punch
to bear on our senses of outrage and
triumph. lcan't really tell i“ would
have liked this movie more if I
couldn't see how much better itcould
have been. or it it simply isn't that
great.

Dramaturges prov ide a general back—
ground of the world of the play and
the playwright. They also help actors
and actresses understand the kind of
characterizations the playwright
wanted, According to Meese, this is
especially important because Chekr
ov “wrote a lot of the roles with
specific actors/actresses in mind."

during practice is “for characters to

“CherryOtchatd” is aplay about

brings to Russian society. An aristo-

with the loss oftheir beautifulestate
and cherry orchard as they move into
the new era. ”This is the preeminent
play of modern drama," explains
Mease. The comedy is often very
difficult to grasp; Farris said none of
the cast understood the humor until
they read it aloud.

Cheko» wrote the play (or a the-
atcr group in Russia, lt uns ii‘ritten
specifically as a comedy because the
theatre group had talten his earlier
plays tooscriously, Thedraniatiirges

The letters give the actors and

actresses an in—depth understanding

performed. Chekov was very angry
With the Russian theatre group early
in the production of “Cherry Or—
chard" because every character on
the stage was being too dramatic.
Farris explains that, for the Grinnell
group, “The challenge or the play
will be to find a nice balance be«
tween comedy and tragedy.”

Period costumes will be rented
from the Guthrie Theater in Minne—

assume their roles.

While the set will be of the es

also be designed to reﬂect the major
themes of the play. “The poetry of
