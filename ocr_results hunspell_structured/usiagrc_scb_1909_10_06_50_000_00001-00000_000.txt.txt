The report oi the receipts arid ex-
penditures iii the interest or the Cole
lege athletic teams has been secured
from c. E. Fisher, the athletic direc-
tor. Although last year was oire or
the most successtril in the history at
athletics in Grinnell, hour a iinanciai
standpoint it was only ordinarily suc
cessiul. .

The best showing was made in Cool:
hall, where a balance or $220.65) was
secured. Two oi the games paid very
well, the Creighton and the Cornell
games, both or which gave balances oi
more than $200.

Contrary to the general impression
basketball shows a small deticit, While
on the lowa, Ames and Des Moines
Y. M. c. a. games the management
was able to make money, with the rest
it was a losing proposition. Easehall
was the heaviest loser, showing a de-
iicit or $156.52. Track shows a sniail
balance, while with tennis there was
a deiicit or considerable size. Alto-
gether, as is evident irom the surn-
niary given below, the problem of ii-
nancing the College athletics or an in
stitution like this, is one at no surall
magnitude. yet when the success ot the
results is taken into account and the
caliber ot the contests that are held in
Grinnell are considered, no small credit
is due the present manager, 0, E. Fish-
