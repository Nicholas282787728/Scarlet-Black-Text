Students
hit the
road

It is unlikely that twenty-two
students will return to Grinnell
next semester or at anytime in the
future. They have been
academically dismissed,

Both Pam Griffin and Robert
Boyd seem to understand the
reasoning behind their expulsion.
But that doesn't seem to soften the
blow.

Dismissal struck Pam like ”the
drop of a bomb" and she felt
that the procedure which led to her
dismissal was “very poor.” Robert
views his dismissal as “legal" but
felt that he was “railroaded.”

A student receives no formal
warning if he or she is being
Considered for dismissal by the
Committee on Academic Standing.
As stated in the college
Bulletin:“The college reserves the
right to dismiss permanently, at
any time, any student whose
academic standing is un-
satisfactory. A student not on
probation may be dismissed for
making unsatisfactory progress
toward graduation, especially if he
or she shows a sudden semester
decline in number of credits
earned, or if he or she has received
an ‘academic warning’."

Pam and Robert were unaware
mat their dismissals were being
considered. When they received
their dismissal letters, they had
not yet received their grade
reports,

Difficulty with the computer was
the reason for the delay in sending
grade reports. Dean Seller of the
Committee on Academic Standing
felt that despite the grade delay,
the students should immediately
be informed of their dismissal.

This delay caused Robert some
confusion because he had
unknowingly failed a course.
because he missed the mid-
semester exam from a misun-
derstanding of the test date and
because he failed to answer the
major essay question on the final
exam.

Robert concedes that these
circumstances were mistakes on
his part but that this mistake
should not have been a reason for
his dismissal. He received an Ar on
the portion of the comprehensive
final which he did complete and
therefore concludes that the reason
for his failure was not “poor
scholarship,"

in a letter to the Scarlet & Black,
Robert said that his teacher had a
right to fail him, “but ethically, the
committee should not have thrown

E6

 

me out . . what has happened to
me was unfair: it not the iailure
itself, then the dismissal,
definitely.” Robert had been on
academic probation and was told
he had to complete sixteen credits
last semester,

Dean Eysenbach, who chairs the
Committee on Academic Standing,
said that the Committee can only
judge results, and it’s up to the
student to present his or her
speciﬁc case. She declined to
comment on individual cases of
dismissal, saying it was in
violation of the socalled Buckley
Amendment.

Before Pam was iniormed of her
dismissal she had applied for a
loan to help finance her Grinnell
education. She received the
necessary form for the loan which
stated that she was in good
academic standing two days before
the arrival of her dismissal letter.
A Grinnell College student is in
good academic standing until he or
she is dismissed or placed on
probation, according to Dean
Eysenbach.

Once Pam was informed of her
dismissal, she attempted to find
out the reasons and to make an
appeal. She was quickly
discouraged and quit, feeling that
She had confronted a “faceless
thing,” never having talked with
anyone on the Committee which
dismissed her. ,

Pam was told to make her appeal
through a letter addressed to Dean
Seller. Following the procedure,
Pam was informed by letter on
Jan. 22 that her appeal was denied.

Unaware that she could make a
personal appeal to the Academic
Standing Committee, Pam gave
up.

Every student dismissed from
the college has a right to appeal.
However, there is no indication of
this in the general college
literature or in the letter of
dismissal. This lack of information
is perhaps why only four out of the
twentyetwo students dismissed last
semester attempted to make an
appeal,

Dean Seller and Dean Eysena
bach feel that if a dismissed
student feels that he or she has a
case against their expulsion, he or
she will make the attempt to ap
peal on their own. However Dean
Seller concedes that me system
should possibly be revised to let a
student know that he or she has a
right to appeal.

Once an appeal is made, what
are the chances for readmission?
Three of the four students who
appealed their dismissal have been
readmitted this semester. In Dean
Eysenbach’s words, “We quite
regularly readmit students who
indicate that the reasons that they
got into academic difficulty were
overcome and that they’re ready to
get on with the business of a
Grinnell education."

Paint,
peeling Er
plaster

Urban renewal Could rescue the
slums if the spirit moves the
masses to attend campus-wide hall
meetings at 7 pm. Sunday. Dorm
renovation, physical and mental,
takes the floor for discussion at the
meetings,

The topic, which has been
suggested by Tederman, Dean of
Student Affairs, and Bob Jacobs,
Associate Dean of Student Affairs,
will cover two aspecB of dorms.
Physical conditions and im-
provements in the halls, in con-
junction with the social at-
mosphere, will generate “wide
open, critical, and honest
discussion of residence hall life,"
Tederman hopes.

The major impetus for ex»
ploratiun of residential quality was
Tederman’s tour of each hall
during the semester vacation, his
first complete tour in two years.
Tederman “was appalled at the
conditions.”

Numerous complaints from
students all year also encouraged
Student Affairs to Study the
problem. Complaints most often
voiced were the use of bland in-
stitutional paint, excessive noise,
the hotelelike atmosphere, and lack
of study rooms and cooperation
among hall members.

Age

Age leaves the the halls like
tenements, as cracking plaster,
fraying rugs, and peeling paint
plague the structures, Tederman
discovered. Major repair is
necessary to restore proper cone
ditions, he declared.

After consulting the Long-Range
Planning Committee last
semester, resident advisers were
convened a week ago by Tederman
and Jacobs 7 concerning the
problem. The outcome of the
conference was that each resident
adviser sought out one interested
Student from each hall to attend a
session Tuesday night. The mass.
simultaneous hall meetings were
suggested by senior Bob Winters in
order to emphasize the importance
of one subject, to convince students
of the plausibility of actual im-
provemens that could result, and
to insure that the campus is well
informed on a subject so greatly
affecting them. Student Affairs,
the resident advisers, and the
interested students will lead the
meetings. Later next week, each
student will turn in a synopsis that
will draw an overall picture as well
as an individual one for the dorm
situation.

Comment on several levels will
be requested, Tederman ex~
plained. Student opinion on long
term renovation, completed
primarily by the college heads the
agenda. Enthusiasm in student
repairs, such as painting hallways
or designing lounges, will also be
monitored by the discussion.
Finally, Tederman is searching for
students’ definitions of a desirable
dorm, For example, do students
prefer dorms for sleep and study or
for a social life?

“Farrout” ideas that could be

implemented on a long-term basis
are sought by Tederman in the hall
discussions, He would hate to see
the meetings degenerate into gripe
sessions when creative proposals
could surface.

, Floor and hail study lounges

A specific idea, proposed by
Tederman, is an increase in floor
and hall study lounges, Ap-
proximately ioo spaces will be
open in fall 1975 that could allow
doubles in many halls to be con-
verted into study lounges. A
disadvantage to this idea would be
a tightening of available room
space, cutting down the number of
underoccupied triples and doubles.
Also, the influx of students from
offacampus second semester would
cause even worse Chaos than this
year. on the basis of the meeting
Tederman will decide whether the
lounges outweigh the disad»
vantages in students' priorities.

The renovation is not definite,
Tederman admitted, because
money is tight, but the ad-
ministration is aware of the need to
renovate and the trustees have also
been advised. With two or three
years‘ delay, the necessary work
will just multiply, Tederman
believes. In five yearsI the work
will have to be done

Physical plant agrees

The physical plant has agreed to
allow students to design dorms and
do some of the work, Tederman
stated. Encouraged by the
cooperation of the physical plant,
Tederman expects the red tape
hassles of student painting and
decorating to be lessened. If the
college doesn’t act quickly on
student proposals for such work,
Tederman realizes the initiative is
lost quickly to academic pressure.

Change room draw?

As a “brainstorming session,"
changes in residence halls from
any aspect could be advanced. The
room-draw system and specialized
sorts of dorms could be considered,
Tederman elaborated. Pointing out
that the room draw system is a
“locked-in feature," he suggested
that perhaps students should
contemplate the pros and cons of
remaining in the same dorm or
room [or more man a year. Special
dorms such as a quiet dorm are
possible topics, Tederman offered.

Tederman admits the entire plan
is “rather ambitious, but we'd like
to give it a try.“ Student reaction
at the Tuesday planning session
bogged down in personal come
plaints about specific dorms in
Winter's estimation. Winters
wasn’t as optimistic as Tederman
about the results of the Sunday
sessions because he was un-
convinced that concrete ad»
ministrative action would follow.

The college, according to
Tederman, has a responsibility to
renovate since it has a captive
audience due to residence
requirements.

SGA
votes on

grass

The use of decorative fertilizer
became the main order of business
at the Wed. night meeting of SGA.
Through the efforts of Scott Fobes,
an open letter to A. Richard
Turner, asking for the foregoing or
reducmg of fertilizer use on
campus grounds, was unanimously
approved. (For text of SGA letter.
see page 4.)

Scott brought to the
organization’s attention the letter
plus a larger study rationalizing it
which he had compiled.

Fobes explained that a reduction
in the use of decorative fertilizer
would bring about lower demand
{or natural gas (an ingredient in
both decorative and agricultural
fertilizers) which would result in
lower prices for gas and in turn
lower prices for agricultural
fertilizer.

Noting that the move would he
basically a symbolic act by the
college, hopefully provoking
similar actions in other in-
stitutions, and that browning grass
may result in high traffic areas,
Fobes emphasized that there
would also be the benefits of good
publicity for the school and savings
in fertilizer cost and labor.

Approval was also gained for the
Social Policies and Regulations
Committee’s housing proposals for
1975-75. Some basic changes in
policy will be the establishing of
Smith hall as a hall with
“definitive quiet hours”, and the
elimination of sex designations on
all rooms on co-ed by alternate
room floors with the exception of
Mears suite (mini coop) which
will alternate between male and
female each year. The result of the
proposals will be that there will be
one room draw rather than two and
number draw will be by an entire
class.

Other business included the
agreement of five halls to take part
in study breaks where the hall will
put up $15 for expenses and the
college will put up $15 for expenses,
through a $100 fund set up by Dean
Walker. There was also a tentative
approval of two SGA constitutional
amendments dealing with the
elimination of all but one vice
president, the elimination of any
sexual restrictions for a specific
office, customary or provisional
and that all candidates and officers
to the executive branch be from the
student body at large.
