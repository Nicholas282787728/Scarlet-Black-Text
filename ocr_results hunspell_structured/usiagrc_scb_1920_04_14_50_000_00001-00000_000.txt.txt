resonant in the lower registers and
sweet and clear on the higher tones

ability which aid in the interpretation
of his selections. In many respects
be is an unusually artistic singer.

His program on Friday evening
.seemed unusually well selected and
contained a number of songs which
were new to his hearers. A group of
cboice‘r‘rench songs was especially
enjoyable and the familiar Prologue
from “Paglia‘oci” was given with
splendid effect.

Negro “spirituals” served Mr. Fa<
guy-Cote well as eucores or which sevA

ouet of roses was presented to Mr,
