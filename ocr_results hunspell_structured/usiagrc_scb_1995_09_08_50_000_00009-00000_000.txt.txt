In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE’I'I‘NER

Two themes always seem to run
through the Hall Senator elections.
getting better bands at Harris and
gettiugbettcrioodinthedininghalls,
in years past (have I really been here
long enough to say that?) he seen
people run for Senator on platforms
that included ideas like getting P
Htitor Subway to cater to us, getting
big hands like Flush and Dave Mac
thews to perform at Harris, and even
promises—here's the kickeriltl'mli
the minutes they post in the john
every week Will include “LOTS OF
COMICSJ’ Needless to say, the only
result or these campaigns has been
Calvin St Hobbes posted over the
Chlamidius Trachomatls section of
the ”Griniiell College Birth Control
GuideAt<A<Olance"onceinawhile,

There are two things that amaze
me about this process. The first is
that people actually run on these
platforms—(lotheyreallyhellevethat
they could get Dave Matthews here?
The second IS that people actually
vote (or themido they really he—
lieve that their Senator is going to
get Subway sandwiches at Quad for
them?

[ think that some of the people
running for Senator. and some oftbe
people voting for them, are missing
the point of the process, which is
representation. liall of Matti Hall
got together and decided they want»
ed the concerts chair to get Plush

here for them, then I suppose their
representative would be compelled
to rncntion it at the SGA meeting.
He or she would feel like a i001, and
it would never go throtigh, but he or
she would have to bring it up all the
same. On the other hand, iiMain
Hall got together and decided they
wanted SGA to help fund a coinmtir
iiiiy serViee proiect, that would be
something worthwhile (or theitsew
atot to bring tip at SOA.

A; {or the food, Just what do
these people think that SGA isgoing
to be able to do abotlt it? SGA
exercises no control over Dining
Servtces, and even if they did. what
kind of food would they expect to
get? Home—cooking lsallttlehard to
do (or 1,000 people.

Asidefromtheprcposterousness
of booking Plush to play at Harris
(where would yon put everyone7
RememberTracyChapmanl),tbere’s
the money; the hundred—dollar or
whatever student activity fee could
nevercoversomething like that, and
ltlon’t think it would be fair to start
charging admission at Harris, Ber
sides, there are awlmleslewotthlngs
l’d rather see this tight—listed college
spend its money on than a concert.

For example, a larger publica.
tions buildingwith new, decent com—
puter equipment, a heater that isn’t
constantly on, and air conditioning
that works Some extra funding
would be nice, too, since SPARC’s
budget might as well be ivtitten out
with a red pen.

But maybe that’s just me.
