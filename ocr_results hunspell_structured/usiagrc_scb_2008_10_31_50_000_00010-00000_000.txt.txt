Jai Garg recaps and prognosticates Halloween costume trends

avJAl GARG

Since the dawn of time man has searched for :1 night when
he could dress absurdly and get drunk without any social conse
quences. Finally, a tradition we call Halloween came to the rose

cue. “It's the Devils holiday dude," said
Haw1J1bnu 11.

Still, much of what we associate with
this glorious (idyilncludmg Cosmn‘tesi
is a recent phenomenon, All Hallow's
Eve hails from a Celtic Pagan tradition,
and Halloween costumes did not appear
until the 1930s. when trick treating
started to become popull Since then,
massrmarketed costumes have becomc
the norm.Accotding to the National Re-
tail Federation, Americans spent nearly
55 billion on costumes in 2006.

Choosing costumes as an cight»yct|t-
old was tough enough. but it seems like
the older we get, the greater the pressure
to think up a unique and clever costume
hecomes.To fully prepare it is important
to look back at the popular costumes of
the past and predict what absurd crea-
tures will be at large this Saturday night.

First are the classics such as pirates,
princesses, and ghosts, which have stood
the test of time and never go out ofstyle.

other costumes, however, are a purely
a product of their time period. The ’70s
brought with them costumes such as
characters from Monty Python and the
Holy Grail and the much beloved Ani—

mal House. And Like most costumes from movies, these chair

actors were short Lived

The biggest contribution of the ‘70s, however, is the invent

een parties ever since and reaches a peak once every four years.
During the 70's, it was the race of Richard Nixon that paraded
through Halloween partiesThe ’805 brought with it the ever-
popular Ronald Reagan and '90s the
heralded Ross Perot This year though,
for the first time ever, .1 female candidate
may be the most prominent tree at Har-
r1s.“i think people will be wcaling po—
litical costumes at nuns," said Wendy
Hendrickson ’12.“Like Sarah Palin."

As the 1989 Cyclone desclibes 1t,“lt's
the Halloween p.11ty in \brrrrher lounge
where students dance amidst a crowd of
cowboys, Moms, and superheroes."

As time went on, the line between
costume and just outright absurdity
began to be bh'uretl. By the 1990s, TV
charactels and po ans were joined by
any idea imag able. “The excitement
was overwhelming," said a student dc-
sctibing Halloween in the 1997 cyclone.
“I just talked to a ladybug, a ttcc,_lanct
Reno, a rolletrskating hoodlum, and
Darth Vader all in one stroll."

By the turn of the century, nearly all
standards of what constitutes a costume
had been abolished and degeneracy en-
sued.The 2002 cyclone describes it best,
“Mermaids danced with Chippendalcs,
angels danced with bikers, devils danced
with incredibly wellrendowed men with incredibly small un-
derwear." So angel or devil, male or female, Barrack Obama or
sarah Palin, this Saturday night, expect the unexpected.
