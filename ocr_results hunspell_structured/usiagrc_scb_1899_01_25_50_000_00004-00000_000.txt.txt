Chapel Addresses.

(Cotillllued Irulll First Page.)
Mr. Trine, along with Mr. Horatio
w. Dresser, of Cambridge, are
sometimes called a survival, or
talliera revival, of New England
transcendentalism, but tllls ls true
only a very limited sensel
Tlieir lreatincnt of spiritual ideals
is extremely plain and simple and
wholesome. directly answering the
questions and stluggles of the in-
dividual soul, and has in it llotllr
ing of the speculative elements of
the old transcelldentalism. Mr,
Trine's essays and addresses,
which are as simple and unaffect-
ed as his quiet and beautiiul per.
sonality, have blought gladness
and restored faith to thousands.
His presence and two addresses
in Iowa College will no doubt‘i
prove very helpful to the college»
lite, presenting asthey will a high-
er order oi religious idealism llian

ls commonly held.

Harvard has secured additions.
amounting to £100,000, to its perr

SIM“, '99, and Pen-er, 'go, note
the Hares, with seven nlinules’
stall to insure no “cutting," and
led the Hounds the incl-l-lest dash
across country that has ever been
run in Glinnell,

Hares and hounds ran the two
and a quarter miles in extremely
fast time considering the heavy
running and the number of fences.
Carpenter was the ﬁrst hound in.

The Run was most encouraging
on account of the number of new
men out.

Next Saturday the Hal-es and
Hounds will start promptly at 3
o'clock. The distance \\‘|II be
short. Let every man collie out.
