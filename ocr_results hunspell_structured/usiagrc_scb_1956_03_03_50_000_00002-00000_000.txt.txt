oi HP president and League Board president in directing the work
of the central committee and Council.

Finally, we are now in the midst of a move ior unified stu-
dent government. This moment is something for which all branches
oi student government deserve credit it may or may not succeed,
we hope it will, but it gives us a good feeling of achievement
to have come this far in agreeing to work at the attempt.

1n finishing, I wish to say that l have enjoyed working with
the Student Council during my time in oﬂice,‘I think it is the
best Council We’ve had in my four years here, as its record
will (testify. The members, almost without exception, were faiths

tul and responsible and put in many long and sometimes tedious
hours both at Council meetings and on committees

They have pl‘oven that the Council can be and is a very im-
portant organ in student affairs, Any iailui-es or shortcomings oi
thls_year's Council may be attributed to the laults oi its president.
I wish to congratulate the Council on its-fine record and hope that
the Council, Student government, and the students of Grinnell

will continue to prosper and to work at improving themselves
and Grinnell college. ‘

Convention PredictionPoinls Out
Important Factors In SC Race

By Dick Hewitt

Although it is only forty—two hours until the Student
Council convention, predictions even at this relatively late _‘
date are at best hazardous. It is becoming increasingly evi-
dent that there are four major factors which must be taken
into consideration before any accurate conclusions concern-

ing the outcome of the convention can be made.

First, how {or out in front in 1‘
terms of actual delegates is Art
Travers? Secondly, is the Art
Grana bandwagon one that can
really roll at the convention or
was it put in gear too late?
Third, is Pete Kizer in a posi-
tion where his relatively solid
and sizeable group of delegates
is going to be the dividing fac»
tor? Fourth, but not least. are'
the so-calied “jag" candidates
actually undercover workers for
one of the so—called serious can»
didates, and can they be effec»
tively swung one way or an-
other? If anybody possessed ac-
curate information as to the
answers to thosejour key points
plus the knowledge of what the
uninslructed'delegation will do,
then he would torecast the rt.»
suits of Saturday’s hassle.

Let's examine the candi-
dates and their campaigns one
liy one and then consider
some other points before de-
oiding,

Pete Kizer has been around
Grinnell off and on for years.
A couple or promising things
about his campaign are these:
considering that he has not been
at Grinnell for three straight
years he is quite well known,
his strength in the freshman
girls' halls (James, Main, Clove-
lzlnd) is most impressive. The
other noticeable {actor is thc‘
unwavering loyalty ot the dele-
gates pledged to Kizer. This
could he an important point it
thc balloting becomes drawn
out.

Almost everyone is ac-
quainted with Art: Travers, He
has been an important fac-
tor since the beginning of the
race, and is the acknowledged
irontrunner. in: strength is
impressive in- almost eve
hall, The big question with
Travers is how solid is
hold on his announced dcl -
gates? ‘

Marv Olsen is also running.
Here again his strength is anl
unknown quantity. Only thc
convention will tell. . t

The enigma oi the race is the
other serious candidate (or the
nomination, Art Grana. At the
time or the writing of this zir-

ticle, Grana‘s hat has been in-
the race less than 24 hours. In
those 24 hours What has been a
fairly cut and dried affair turn-
ed out to be a full ﬂedged po-
litical hassle. Can Gran; win
the nomination at the convention
without the buildup of a cam-
paign and with very few com.
mitted delegates to start with?
This is the crucial question. It
he can win a nomination in fair-
.ly spectacular style than Grana
is the man to beat in the elec~
tion. More predictions later, first
let us consider the so-called
“jag" element.

The only “jogs” who have
campaigned at all extensively
are Steve Michaelides and
Jersey \Villinlns. Both have
largo amounts of support 31-
though the Grana announce-
ment has made inroads into
the strength 01 each. When the
convention ﬁnally gets down
to serious business after the
ﬁrst {cw hours of jag activity
then the votes at Williams and
Michaelidos, the two leading
jays, may not go as some of
the campus politicians fig-
urctli
Other jag candidates will be
nominated (Bob Barr, it is ru-
mored, plans on nominating the
whole junior class, one by one)
including Dave Steiner, Steve
MacDonald, Jim Gabrielson, etc
Now for some predictions.
Travers should be the first one
to reach the major 35% of the
delegates, the amount needed to
nominate. He could run into
trouble though if the Grand and
Kizer groups continue to pirate
backers away from him or from
some of his not so publicized
cohorts, It is rather doubtful
that Kizcr and Grana will be
Successful. It would and should
be cons dcred .1 sign of extreme
Travers weakness if he doesn’t
pull 35% early in the serious
balloting Expect some tricky
manucvoring if he shows up
well cai-ly.
