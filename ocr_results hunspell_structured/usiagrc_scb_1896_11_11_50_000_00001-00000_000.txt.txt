Grlnnell Institute.

Giving to the small attendance
the Grinnell Institute presented
a shorter program than usual last
Saturday evening.

As the ﬁrst number. Richard»
son summed up the news oi the
week. Crawford following With
a very interesting and well Writ:
ten sketch of the life and writings
of Harriet Beecher Stowe,

Crandall gave anotliei evidence
of the liking of the Institute for
Eugene Field by reading “Mode
jeska as Camille."

On account of the non-appear-
ance of the dehator. the regular
debate was omitted a d the re-
mainder of the program devoted
to extemporaneous work.

Ricker in a somewhat lengthy
speech told of his “Election EX-
periences" and Peterson dis-
coursed cn "Brutality in Foot-
ball." The programclosed witha
discussion of the ”Signiﬁcance of
Tuesday's election from a Repub-
lican and a Democratic Stand-
point." by spaulding and Marsh
respectively.

In the business meeting Waters
man and Pope were installed as
active members,

Chrestomathlan.

The program Saturday evening
was quite up to the Chresto stand
ard. It was opened With the
news of the week by Mr. Myer.
This was the gentleman's ﬁrst ap-
pearance on the program and he
acquitted himselt well.

The next number was a please
ingly rendered piano solo by Miss
Hiatt.

Peck then read a paper on
Greek letter fraternities in Amet-
ican colleges. It was caiefully
written and was quite instructive.

The extemporaneous work was
good. Five speeches were called
for instead of the usual number,
three. The speakers and subjects
were as follows: The advisability

S. U. l. Defeats Mlssouri.

The game at Columbia Monday
between the Universities of Iowa
and Missouri resulted in a victory
for the ”Old Gold” by a sc0ie of
12 to 0. But owing to 'he forfeit»
nre oi the game by the Missouri
tettm the game will be credited to
lowa by the score bro 0. Prob-
ably nothing that has happened in
the development of football either
east or west has ever had the dis-
astrous cheer on the game as that
which will result from the dis-
graceful conduct of the Missouri
team and its supporters on this
occasion. The disturbance. aside
from the natural tendency of the
Missouri students to lay aside
during an athletic contest what-
ever of good breeding Nature
from the kindness of her heart
may have endowed them with.

-may be traced to the 'act that

Kinne Holbrook. a colored man.
an American citizen and vastly
more of a gentleman than the lime
jority of his Missouri acquaint
aiices. was a melt her of the Iowa
team Even before the game. in
the coiiitlois oi the hotel in which
the S, U. 1. boys were staying. ex
pression was openly given by Miss
soul-i alumni that the negro would
be killed Iowa's team had not
yet reached the ﬁeld before the

students and townspeople com-
menced to yell. “There's the 7
lliegro." “The Tigers will kill the
negro." But Holbrook paid no
attention to these insults. When
the Columbia team came upon
the ﬁeld the cries were renewed;
but this time they were personall
appeals to members of the team
to “kill the nigger " Under sneh
circumstances as these the game
was begun.

There were some students in
the crowd, who showed by the 620
pression on their faces that they
disapproved ot such proceedings.
but they were so vastly outnum-
bered, that their protests availed
nothing.

The game itseli is a tiresome
one to 'recotlnt and none the less
disgusting to read about. Every
questionable decision was seized
by the Missourians as an oppor-
tunity for abuse to be heaped up-.
on Iowa's referee.

The excitement reached its cul-
minating point when one of the
Missouri players stole the ball af-
ter it had been downed by Leiglie
ton and ran up yards hefme he
was tackled by I'Iolbrook. The
referee decided that the ball must
be retuinetl to the spot on which
downed. The Missouri
team refused to do this and for-
feited the game to S. U, I. with
the score as stated above.

Thioughout the entire contest
Holbrook. though he would not
be human if he was not stirred by
the epithets applied to him. con-
ducted himself only as a gentle-
man and as such won the admirar
tion of all fairrminded spectators.

It is safe to predict that Coltime
bia people will never again be per
mitted to witness a football game
between the Universities of Iowa
and Missouri.

Basket Ball.

Basket ball, in the short time in
which it has been played in this
institution. has made rapid strides.
and two teams are now regularly
organized. one being composed of
cottage ladies and the other of la?
dies rooming out in town. A’
match game was to have been
played early this neck to decide
the championshipbnt unfavorable
weather prevented. The room

it was

 

 

over the C. O. D. laundry which

was used as a baseball cage last
winter. has been rented by the
management of the cottage team
and ﬁtted up suitably so that
secret practice may be carried'on.
It is rumored that as an additional
attraction for Saturday the chamr
pionship basket ball game will be
played in the armory.

College Pins.

The demand tor college pins
among the students and alumni
has been so great that E. W. Ath-
erton. ’95. some weeks ago made
asketch embodying the ideas of
several alumni on the subject and
sent it east for several ﬁrms to
submit their ﬁgures, The result
has been that a most beautiful pin
has been produced and at an ex-
peltse not extravagant when the
quality of the pin is considered.
There will be in reality two pins,
one of themtbeing designed for
all the alumni of the college and
the other one especially tor eels

lege athletes who have worn the
“G," The pins will be on sale at
H. P, Proctor's some time next
week and a little attention to the
above distinction by purchasers
will obwate much diﬂ‘iculty
