SATURDAY SHOULD see a large
crowd of students at the fair
grounds to rvitness the home ﬁeld
meet. Since the dual meet is to
be held in Iowa City this will be
the only chance tor many of see-
ing the athletes who are to repre;
sent Griiinell on the track this
year. Let every student attend.

_..i

EVERYONE wno intends to con-
test in the Home Field Meet and
has not paid his Athletic Union
dues. should take care to see the
treasurer before Saturday. It is
arule of the Union that no man
shall contest who has not paid his
dues; and this will be strictly ens
forced. The dues are not so
heavy that anyone cannot pay
them and they should have been
paid at the beginning at the see
mester whether one expected to
go into the meet or not.

As there was not a sufﬁcient
nrrrnher or active members pres
sentatthe business meeting last
Saturday to constitute a quorum,
no blistness was transacted. The
toiiowing leports were given:

The Devotional Committee of
the Y. M. and Y. W. C, A. met
Saturday April 8th and selected
the Thursday and Sunday evening
topics rcr this spring term. These
topics have been printed and the
cards given to all the students.
The meetings this month have
been the regular prayer meetings
and it is the idea of the commit»
tee that most of the meetings for
the coming term shall be such.

The ﬁnancial committee met
Tuesday April iith, and assigned
to each member fourteen names
to collect term taxes and pledges
from. The committee decided to

meet regularly every fourth Tuess
day. Since this was the ﬁrst meet
ing there is nothing to report as
to the amount of collections made
but several unexpected coiitl'ibtis
tions have encouraged the merit
bars to hope that the budget will
be raised by the end of the year.

See the wrestling and rtinniii"
races in the Greek play at the

Rand Gymnasium Apr. 28 and 29.

 

ON ACCOUNT of the bad weather
winch has prevailed for the past
few days, the dual class meet be-
tween treshmen and sophomores
will not be held until after the dual
meet with Iowa City. While this
is a disappointment to marry and
in some respects a drsadvuntngc,
yet it will insure an interesting
home meet. All the athletes of
the two lower classes should eon-
tintie their training and gain the
experience which comes irorn par-—
tierpation in the home meet.

There are about ﬁtteen men in
training at the University of Penn

sylvania for positions in the pule ‘.

vault at the intei‘scollcgiate cham-
pionship.*Ex.
