Uofl IPIRG folds

Grinnell IPIRG needs support in future

by Laura Carter

The recent folding of the Iowa Public
interest Research Group’s chapter at
the University of Iowa has raised con-
cern for the future of the statewide
organization and for its three remain
ing active chapters.

IPIRG is a state lobbying group that
sprang from the toundation of a na-
tional PIRG by Ralph Nader in 1972 as a
student activist group. The organiza-
tion deals with environmental and
social issues and expresses its interests
through its lobbyist in the Iowa
Legislature and its involvement in
local. state and national projects.

The remaining chapters in the state
operate at the University oi Northern
lowa, lowa State University and Grin-
nell College and representatives lrom
each local group comprise the IPIRG
state board. Grinnell‘s lone represen
tative to the state board is Bill Ugilvie,
who has served in the position since the
end of the 197930 academic year and is
also heading the group this year.

Each ol the other chapters con-
tributes three members to the board
which Ogilvie described as. “relatively
active; functioning to serve state
chapters." The state board oversees
and supports the local groups which
conduct their own specilic projects
such as the Grinnell drive to cut energy
consumption. Iowa State's intervention
into the control oi a park and a project
undertaken at UNI to devote one full
day of district court action to housing
complaints.

Thﬁe individual chapters also sup-
port the state board by providing the
funds to keep it afloat and to pay the
staff members. The board operates on
53,000 annually and Grinnell is trying to
add $300 a year. However, the organiza-

tion did not have enough money to pay ‘

its executive director tor three months
oi the past year and only the UNI and
Iowa State chapters contributed to the

salary for the other nine months This
financial problem came to a head
March 17. when University at Iowa
students voted down the "negative
check-oil System" by which that
chapter is tunded.

This system is part of the student
registration procedures at the u at l
and at Grinnell. On each U of I registra-
tion card are names of various campus
supported groups with boxes next to
them If the student does not wish to
lund a group, he merely checks the ad-
jacent box. By leaving the box open, the
student consents to paying a certain lee
which will be given to that group. it the
student later decides to withdraw his
support. he can receive a refund at that
amount.

Nader called this one of the most fair
systems and “hyper-democratic” but
students at Iowa decided to take
IPIRG's name off the cards and.
thereby. not support it with a $3 dona-
tion. 'rwo student government
organizations at the school have also
decreased IPIRG's funding. As a
result. the chapter there closed March
20 and State IPIRG Executive Director
Jim Schwab also resigned.

"What essentially happened at the u
0! I chapter is a political issue." said
Ogilvie. "They [IPIRG membersl can't
be in the position at scraping up a llVr
ing. It's the difference between the
group worrying about its next money
and being lucrative enough to do what
IPIRG Wants to do. The position now is
-it you want us. rund us.‘ "

Although Ogilvie ielt. “The Grinnell
chapter is not directly affected." the
group is having similar support and
rinancial problems. Ogilvie reported
that there is a mailing list of 70 persons
and 12 students actively volunteer their
etiorts tor the group, However. he feels
that the number or people involved
could be much larger and, therefore,

more money could be raised than from
Grinnell's 32 negative check~oil
system. He sees many reasons tor a low
participation rate at Grinnell. One is
“top priority goes to academics and
people on campus have a tendency to
say ‘I'd rather not have to worry about
it.’ " Another reason ior apathy
towards IPIRG. Ogilvie felt. is ”The
priorities are no longer politically
oriented "

To counter these attitudes. he would
iirst try to “make something like
lPIRG partly academic “ He thinks in-
dividual projects and study or group
dynamics could be involved in such a
program. Ogilvie cited the LEAP pro-
gram which existed at Grinnell from
1969-71 as an example at his idea
"Students interested in the environ
mentgot profs involved and it became a
class," he said but added. "the profs
took over and didn't continue the in-
teraction."

Ogilvte would also try "to educate the
campus on what's really going on and
let students know IPIRG is very cone
cerned," However. he realized. "It
would take time, effort and organiza-
tion to begin to change ideas and at-
titudes on campus,“ This awareness is
also diiricult to promote, he said,
because "people would chuckle
because of the View oi IPIRG right
no

This view of IPIRG that Ogilvic sees
on campus stems from the projects the
group has undertaken this year
"Recycling paper is not recognized as
your typical activist activity." he said
Besides the recycling program. IPIRG
has also been working on a pmJect to
cut down energy consumption on came
pus. ”We would pick a building and
analyze its energyeeificiency." Ogilvie
stated "The biggest energy waste is
the electricity in students' lifestyles."

The group saw that the energy usage
on campus was 20 percent higher ﬁrst
semester or this year than the previous
year and Wanted to make the communi-
ty aware ol the increase. IPIRG
members then posted signs and
stickers to remind people to conserve,
They also wrote letters and memos to
congresspersons to urge them to main-
tain a strong energy policy.

The longrterm aim of Grinnell IPIRG
is “to become popular enough to raise
$300 a year or 25 cents per student."
Ogilvie stated "Then we can pay our
own way and work more closely with
the state board." He feels confident
about the future of the board because
"It's an old enough and strong enough
tradition. lt's respected as a very
capable organization."

Ogilvie also said. "There's a good
chance of IPIRG coming back through
avpetltion drive because a lot at people
are beginning to leel guilty. But beiore
a petition drive we have to get
support."
