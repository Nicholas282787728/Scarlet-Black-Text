Conway Believe:
Poems of Vergil
Show Philosophy

“The affection of human beings was
for Vergil the fundamental fact of
the universe,” declared Robert S. Con-
way, professor emeritus of Manches-

ter university, in his lecture last
night in Herrick chapel. Professor

Conway's appearance was sponsored
by the Grinnell college lecture course.
He was introduced by Prof, J. M.
Eridgham.

In developing his subject. "The
Philosophy of Vergl‘l,” Professor Con—
way brought attention to the fact
that Vergil stands out from the other
Roman poets in his extensive know~
ledge of Greek authors. and in his
infusion of Greek ideas into his writ—
ings of ltalian life. The Greek hatred
of extremes, the childlike capacity
for wonder. and philosophic dualism
are all represented in Verg‘il.

Dualism, the considering of things
in pairs, Mr. Conway illustrated by
passages from the Aeneid and the
Georgics. That Vergil's analytic
habit of mind never allowed him t0
see one fact or object without corre—
lating it to a parallel situation, is
shown in his mention of natural caus—
es as well as divine.

Raleigh All ‘Wet’
at Initiation of

History was portrayed and history
was made in the quadrangle dining
room Wednesday evening during the
dinner held by the Grinnsli chapter
of National Collegiate Players.

At the “request" of the members
of the Chapter, the initiates gave a.
little skit portraying the introduction
of tobacco by Sir Walter Raleigh at
the court of Queen Elizabeth. The
dining room was entertained by the
singing of one member of the court
retinue. Then "Sir Walter” arrived
with the famous weed. After telling
the queen something about his great
discovery. he proceeded to demorr
strata.

Quccn Takes a ‘Dmg‘
Although he was not given the his-
torical bucket of water in the face,
the cry of ﬁre and the grabbing for
a water glass gave rise to momentary
speculation ‘dmong the members of
the audience, while others wondered

if he might be “exiled." But if that
shocked them. imagine their con-ster-
nation when thc “Cood Queen Bess"
took a couple of drags.

But because Elizabeth had been a
partner in the "Crime." nothing was
said. Who would dare to "exile" her
majesty, the queen?

After the dinner the formal initia-
tion took place at. the home of Mrs.
Sara Sherman Pryor. director of

Sophomore Rally Spells

Loss for Juniors

tournament, the Grinnell freshman
team turned in a 22—15 score to down
the senior quintet yesterday after-
noon. The frosh have been working

start of the first quarter, and kept
ahead all of the time.

Frye was the high point man for
the freshmen, dropping in four bas-
kets, while Waite was close behind
