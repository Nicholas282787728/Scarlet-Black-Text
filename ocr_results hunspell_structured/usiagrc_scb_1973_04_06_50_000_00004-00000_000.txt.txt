Black Housing And
Affirmative Action

Implementing a process worked out as a compromise between
representatives of the Concerned Black Students and the Student
Government Association this week, most Grinnell black students
conducted a room draw separate from that of whites and selA
ected rooms in seven campus dormitories which had been
previously designated for “black clusters."

This practice, now in its third year, has been defended by
members of CBS and sympathetic white students as a move
to facilitate black adjustment to the predominantly white
environment of Grinnell, and is justified as particularly helpful
to incoming black freshmen. While the importance of these
arguments cannot be denied, the process is in our opinion
an illegitimate one. Descended as it is from the principle
of “affirmative action,” it is a dangerous extension of a bad
idea.

The Civil Rights movement of the 1960's contained a certain
vital idealism: the desire to uplift man and to believe that,
given a correct guidance, he could live according to laudable
and democratic principles. As such, it worked for the reason-
able maxim of nondiscrimination, the judgment of a person
according to his merit rather than according to his color.

Affirmative action, however, has changed all that, Now the
emphasis is not on ”equality of opportunity,” but rather on
what Daniel Bell has called “equality of result." Frustrated

,by the slowness of the non-discrimination approach, civil rights
advocates grew desperate and transformed earlier rhetoric
into principles that promised immediate results, no matter
what the cost.

This institutionalizes the lack of a relationship between
merit and reward. The original argument of the civil rights
movement was that fair judgment of merit will eventually
lead to proportional representation, but nowvby perverted
logic-»the argument has been twisted to read the other way
around. The hope is that institutionalized proportional repre»
sentation will lead to a fair judgment of merit.

Ideolistic pleadings, given the force of law as they have in
the United States, can turn into repression every bit as real
as the prejudice the original movement attempted to thwart.

The psychological effect on both whites and-blacks is dan—
gerous: one group is made to feel that it must no longer judge
on the hallowed basis of merit because of the past transgres—
sions by those who have the same color of skin, and the other
group find themselves being given positions and preferential
treatment merely because of their skin color and not because
of intrinsic worthwhile qualities. ,

But the worst of it, of course, is the extension of the concept
into other areas as well. What was begun for the benefit of the
black citizens of America has becomeacrusade for all sorts of
categories. And the color of skin has itself become the factor
in deciding representation in such perhaps extraneous areas
as: student housing.

After affording black students financial aid in rder to attend
Grinnell and after instituting a policy of recrui ng black sch,
olars to come to the campus as professors-»both policies,
in our opinion, defendable and justifiable to some extent--the
extension of the same preferential treatment into housing, and
the subsequent guarantee that a student with black skin will
not get a room not only in a black cluster but a room of better
than average quality as well, is simply going too far.

The princtple now is not the same: we are not talking about
proportional representation any longer, but preferential treat-
ment on another level, for reasons quite apart from even
”equality of result.” This is inequality, in the strongest
sense.

The nature of housing, we believe, is not so crucial as
to allow great sociological benefits to be gained by such a
practice. And if nothing else, the system of black clusters
helps to politicize and institutionalize that very boundary
between the races we have strived so intently to eradicate.

Golbeck- Police Hands Oil Policy Gone loo Far

To the Editors:

My purpose in writing this letter
is twofold, First, it has come to
my attention that many unfounded
rumors have started as a conse-
qunce of the theft which my room-
mate and I experience last week-
end, and these I would like to dis-
pel; second, I feel that the College
community should be aware of the
multiple thefts which have been
committed on campus, especially
within the last two years, as these
have largely *remained nnnoticied
by the College at large.

To clarify what the circumstances
were in the theft which we exper—
ienced is necessary in order to
dispel the rumors My roommate
and I left our locked room in Dibr
ble Annex for two hours between
11:00 p.m, and 1:00 a.m. Saturday
night, and returned to find our
locked door broken into and five
parts or our stereo component sys
tem (worth over $700) stolen, The
gouges out of the side of the door
and frame seem to indicate that
some instrument had been used
to pry the door open, and hence
that the act had been premeditated.

My first reaction was to call the
police, which I attempted to do via
use of the hall phone, but which i
found to be dead. I then ran over to
Dibble Hall, luckily remembering
that there was an open phone on
first floor.

While I was using the phone in
Dibble, I could see four guys walk-
ing into the Annex. Circumstances,
the sensitivity of which bars their
discussion here, indicate to us that
these guys were returning for more
of the “loot", as there were also
numerous other items of value in
the 1"qu at the time.

We can and are trying to investi-
gate this situation, as these guys
are not part of the College student
body, but were of student age. Their
size also indicates that they could
have successfully busted into the
locked door and easily carry the
amount oi stolen property that they
did.

It should also be pointed out that
there was no one in Dibble Annex
at the time the theft was come

mltted, and that the annex has been
a vulnerable Spot for thefts in the
past (a stereo was stolen from the
same room exactly one year ago).

This inlormution, lhcpe, will serve
to clarify many ofthe versionsofthe
same story that are going around.

I would like to stress the fact
that this act must have been thought
out before put into action. Not only
must these outsiders have Obtained
information of the worth of our
stereo from somewhere within the
College community, but they also
must have known that the Annex
was such a vulnerable spot for them
its in the past. The Job was not
haphazardly done, either, as the
thiefs made a special point of clos-
ing all oi the curtains, both in the
room and in the hallway, They also
must have known that there was
and would be no one on the floor
at the time the theft was committed.
So they managed to walk right out
the front door with Our property.

If it is this easy for grand theft
to he committed on this campus,
it is no wonder that there has been
the rash of Stealings within the
last two years, Idon’t [eel that the
administration and student body can
afford to ignore this situation any
longer, especallly when doors are
bing broken down.

The locks on our doors have been
our only protection within the dorms,
and it these can no longer keep crr
iminals out, then it is time that
we sat down to think what could
happen next: Rape? Murder?? t the
ink that we have been just plain
lucky so far, as these sorts of ac-
tiVities are taking place at colleges
all around the country.

What is to make up immune from
all of this? What will it take for
this community to finally realize
that some security measures must
be taken here?

Everyone must be aware by now of
the lack of security on this campus.
B&G doesn’t work on Sundays, so
we had to wait until Monday to have
our door fixed with a new lock. The
not: men who patrol the loggias
at night are not trained security
men. The phones are turned off at
12:30 -- what if in emergency sh-

Haas. Interlulure In Hague

(Ed. note: Grinnell student Teel
Haas is presently spending a sem»
ester in the Hague, preparing a re~
port on the International Court of
Justice as part or Interfuture pro~
gram, which sponsors student re~
Search overseas. This month Grin-
nell will nominate two Students to
participate in IF nextyear. TheprOr
gram director is Professor Victor
Verrelte.)

Dear Mr. Verrette,

(Craig) Murphy mentioned that you
were interested in hearing ourinitial
reactions to some of what’s been
happening here.

Firstly, I think we got some prer
tty good preparation in New York.
Our first “assignment" was to stay
in Chinatown for an entire day and
we were told to learn as much
about the community as we could,
using whatever techniques we deem,
ed appropriate and withoutassociatr
ing with the others in the group.
Although it may not sound too diffi-
cult the day proved to be one hell
of a Cultural Shock. I was about
ready to brace myself fol" another
Grinnell winter and forget about
Holland‘

We were in Paris from Sunday ov-
ening through Monday afternoon.
Murphy and I ended up staying a
little longer than the Others since
we were the lucky two of the group
to get our pockets on the Metro!
But it did allow me an opportunity
to see some of those sights I'd only
seen in books for the last seven
years or SO, I think I about had
heart failure when the taxi was br—
inging us in irom Le Boill'gel and
out of nowhere the Arc de 'I‘riomr
phe pops into sight! Until then I
don‘t think I ever really believed
It existed or that l was in Paris.
So I have been in the Hague tlirs

ee weeks. housing turned out to he ,

something of a problem. The Cour»
dinalor had not done her job, but
I think part of the problem stems
from a general housing shortage
here i have been In a “pension"
doing my own cooking, nnd tl'zivelr
ing to lhe Institute oi the Peace

Palace every day.

Dr. Syatauw has been incredibly
good, He Virtually nailed me to the
wall on much of what Ihad said
in my independent Project paper
from last semester. ,It was far
from a pleasant exercise but now
I knew some of the mistakes in
thinking I kept repeating and that
some of. my comments were act-
ually incorrect. Syatauw really “kn—
ows his stuff.” I have met with him
once a week for an hour each time,
He is a very skeptical, reserved
and demanding person, but I know
his criticisms are more than worth
their weight in gold. If nothing else,
IF is worth it when such capable
people consent to participate as no,
visors! i like being on my own
and not herded around in a group
as we saw many of the students
on our flight over were, also.

I am the first to acknowledgesome
of IF”: basic problems, but after
the Trustees meeting in NYC, the
pre-departure conference and my
time here, I think there are a lot
of good things and I think some of
the not-so-good will be changed
even before the summer, I for
one, think that this is the type of
program Grinnell should support,
especially from the academic stand-
point.

I have to admit that I don’t really
miss Grinnell this semester. The
Change of scenery had proved most
beneficial and between the Peace
Palace and the Institute lhave ac-
cess to better library resources
than I could ever have in lowa,
Besides I’VE.I seen the public cere»
mony for the new lCJ judges, am
meeting lots of interesting people,
learning some Dutch, eating good
things (cheese, uitsmijter, ertwen-
soep, bi-oodies, bread) and some»
times feeling isolated. I have Vll‘»
tually mastered public transport,
know where to get English news-
papers and even figured out how to
operate the coin-op washing mu-
clllnes‘ So life is a clncli Bull
do miss my cello.

ould arise? At least these phones
could be connected after hours tothe
fire or police departments ifsuch an
emergency should arise.

I think it is important to the future
of this College for some action to be
taken on the part of the administra-
tion and student body in this matter.
Immediate action, What prospective
is going to decide to spend over
$4000 a year to attend a school
that is becoming more and moreiln-
safe every year? Let's face it, this
island of paradise knownasGrlnnell
College is rapidly acquiring all or
the negative characteristics of a
large city, which many at us hoped
to get away from by coming here.
It is up to us to do something con-
structive about repairing this com—

Townsend, Arnold:
Cluster System

To the Editors:

“Speak out”, as the song goes.
"You've got to speak out against
the madness." The madness in this
case is the cluster system of hous—
ing black students. The system sets
up a barrier that inhibits interaction
between black and white students.
This barrier promotes the lack of
understanding which we feel is the
cause of the racial problems on
campus.

We realize as white students it
is difficult for us to understand
the problems of adjustment for a
black student to a white dominated
environment. But this form ofpseu»
do-integration solves nothing. The
cluster system perpetuates the al—
ready apparent schism between blr
ack and white students and in no way
helps to alleviate the delicate art
of relating at others,

As long as the cluster system
remains, the problems oi adjusting
to Grinnell are not being faced.

Brown, Walsh:
Responsibility

To the Editors:

There has recently been a rash
oi thefts on campus To our knowe
ledge no effective action has been
taken by either the police or lheadr
ministration concerning twostereos
lifted from Dibble Annex last Sat-
urday. We find it hard to under-
stand why when wenl'e paying$4,000
a year to go here we nre expected
to put up with people's lightrfln-
gered habits

The administration can step in
on everything from housing to lllv
dependents to grading systems, yet
when anybody mellllons prosecuting
or apprehending criminals thev are
suddenly helpless and can't do any
thing [5 the college going to wait
until someone is assaulted to Step
in and do something? We don't feel
safe, unymoi-e, when as insmui-days
case rooms areactuallybroketlillto
With all the Committees, councils,
boards, etc is it really so hard to
get some security measures passed?
Just who is responsible for our
safety? Sydney Brown
