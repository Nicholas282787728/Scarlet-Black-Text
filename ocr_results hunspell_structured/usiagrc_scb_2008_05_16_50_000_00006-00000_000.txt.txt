A harrered srella Arrois label, a Los Anr
geles counry Museum of Arr (LACMA)

and a green-suired, sunglassesrdonning,
diseo-era Lego man named Bubblegum are
jusr a few irems found in rhe wallei ofDani
Zamora, a 24eyearrold srudio Arr major
from Los Angeles.

The Srella label, I was lold, was saved
from rhe lirsr horrle of srella rhar Zamora
ever drank. Since rhea, Srella has become his
favorire been While rhey may seem srrange av
firsr, the eonrenrs of rhe wallet ean ro make
sense onee you ralk ro Zamora: rhe wallct's
Contems are as eeleerie, colorful and inrrignr
ing as rheir owner.

Zamora, a 5~foot 5 and 1/Zeinch Aries
who enjoys drinking hazelnut lanes while
reading Chuek Palahniuk novels, eame ro
Grinnell in 2004 wirh rhe intention oima-
joring in Thearer. After raking a few eourses,
however, he changed his mind. “I diseov-
ered I wanted ro be an arrisr when 1 came ro
Grinnell college," he said.

From rhen on Zamora has focused on lns
life as an Arr major ar Grinnell. Ar rhe mar
menr, Zamora is involved heavily in dance
and drawing, He has choreographed mule
ripls dances ar Grinneu, including “Spuren"
(German for feeling) in rhis semesrer's proe
duerion oi“spring" and “spuren” (German
for footsteps) in a produeuon lasr semesrer.

Zamora’s visual arr also reileers his inner
esr in dance and body movemem,eomplering
a MAP about represenring rhe relarionship
herween rhe rwo on paper. His work de-
seribes rhe convusation herween danee and
two-dimmsional drawing Recemly, Zamora
has been drawing and painring using his fact
lo eaprure rhe molion of daneing on huge
sheers of paper.

One of his pieces, "45 minures of Parr
ouerres," is eurrenrly on display in the Des
Moines Arr Ccmer. Wirh rhe eneourager

work in response to a eall [or open submisr
sions. He gave a presenearion in Des Moines

All of anom’s work is inspired by mu-

les, are a few of his favoiire musieians, He
was lisrening ro Rex nga while drawing

Besides raking phoros ofliis cow, Zamtr
