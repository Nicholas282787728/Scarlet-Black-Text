wildly wondrous humanity,
harmony of hands and meanings,
more magnificent in tension,

 

by Chris T. Johnson

The man with the long crook»
ed nose, who was possessed
by devils, walked slowly up
the hill toward the tall brick
building where he lived. He
considered nething in particu-
lar about his lifeashestrided.
He looked upon the world with
an air, not his ordinary one,
one of his own creation which
was nevertheless very real to
him. An air of gentle haughti—
ness, which was characteris
tic of his possession. it was
only yesterday that he had
become possessed. The air of
haughtiness was directed in
ward and this accounted for its
gentleness. The man felt that
it was acceptable to be haughr
ty to oneself as long as one
did not parade it around.

A small brown dog was amb-
ling down the hill. He stopped
as the man approached and
scratched a meditative flea,
slowly, with no unnecessary
vigor, as if he had been con-
sidering the matter for a long
time. It was not the impulsive
sort of scratch that the ordinr
ary dog is given to, and both
he and the man lmew it. The
man felt as if there were
something that he should say
to the dog but he did not know
quite what. Something Ofrelar
tive weight, something which
would mark him as a man who
knew what to say to dogs whose
hair reminded him of pine
needles. All he could think of
was “here boy." As the dog
got up to amble off the man
tossed his curly black head

“FOR NICKY”

and smiled. The dog smiled
back.

The man ran his fingeralong
'the side of his nose as he cl-
imbed the stairs to his rooms
in the second story of the tall
brick building which over
looked most of the surround-
ing neighborhood. it was a
somewhat nervous contempla»
tive gesture he had picked up
a few months backwhiletaking
nose flute lessons. It had an-
noyed his teacher greatly. He
himself rarely gave it a th-
ought. When he did he was
usually unable to decide whe-
ther or not it was a bad habit.
He unlocked his door andwent
in. Crossing the room he went
to the window and looked out.
It was one of those Sunday 3f.
ternoons when he did net be-
grudge the day its name. His
walk in the garden had been a
peaceful one. He sat down.

He had not Slept Well thenight
before because he was laugh-

him up. It had not bcenaple. ,

the time. Today, he was much
calmer but given to an ocean
sional irritability.

The man was growing tired
of this, These two devils had
been playing inane games on
him since he met them at a
card party at the home of a
friend of his, His friend lived
in a wee hole in the ground.
it was sort of inconvenient to
get there, but his friend did
interesting things and had an
enjoyable manner. He was the
only person the man knew who
could tell funny stories about
what happened to the physiO'
gnomies of horses if you ap
plied slightly modified frenc-
logy rules to them. His friend
was a nurt.

The mrd game itselfhad cer-
tainly gone well enough with
the light streaming in from
the ground above. Bright and
glowing yellow it filled the
room with a conveniality en-
tirely fitting his friend’s col-
lected nature. There had been
oral indulgence of both sorts.
His friend served little treats
constantly throughout the
game and commentedhow nice
it was that one could almost
always get a foursome toge-
ther these days. At the time,
they seemed like ordinary cn-
ough devels. The only thing
about them was that one of
them seemed unusually quiet,
and the man with the long
crooked nose was unable to
determine whether or net this
was because the other always
spoke for him. They played a

very tightly organizedandneat
game of whist, always careful
hat to overbid even if they did
double to an extent not really
to their benefit. After cards
there had been pomegranate
sherbet, and his friend, dryly
speculating whether there mi-
ght not be a market among
the four-fingered giants for
genuine cow udder gloves, be-
gan to tidy up. With the rest
of the warm afternoon stret-
ching out ahead ofhim the man
fell comfortably asleep in his
chair. The inside Of his eyes
lids was red.

The inside of his eyelidswas
black. The man was very con»
scious of his awakening. He
had been dreaming about be
ing in a funeral parade and
moving slowly away from the
cemetery, he was having a
little difficulty remembering
who it was that had been bur-
ied. It. had been someone imr
portant, he was sure of that,
but exact identities were get-
ting a little hazy. The people
on either side of him were
beginning to take on a sort of
friendly unfamiliarity. Out of
a vague feeling of hypocrisy,
generated probably by being
involved in a parade saluting
someone he just couldn‘t re-
member anymore, the man
stepped out of the street, and
lost awareness of anythingbut
the inside of his eyelidswhich
he had closed. They were black
like velvet. A quick panic
rushed over him. The man was
no longer certain thathe could
open his eyes. This seemed
foolish to him; he openedthem

to find that he was alone.
His, friend was gone and the
devils were nowhere in sight.
His friend’s wee hole seemed
gloomy and illrlit. The shaft
of light coming down from ab~
ove seemed more like a gray
stone pillar what what it was.
It seemed to be blocking his
exit. The man felt confined;
He felt constricted. He felt
cramped. He wanted to escape.
As he escaped to the world
above, he felt a sudden surge
of glorifying energy. Thiswas
HIS moment, and he wasproud
of it. But somehow this fee]-
ing did not last long, because
the world above was too quiet
for emotions of that sort. In
fact, it seemed abnormally
quiet to the man. He ran his
finger along the side of his
nose and looked at his watch.
It was seven thirty. PM. The
sun had already set but he had

'the strange feeling that it was

going to come up againalmost
immediately. The man felt
disoriented and slightly an-
noyed. Somehow things didnot
seem to bematchinghis mood,
so he decided to take a walk.
He always found walks com-
forting.

Walking slowly, as he waited
for his thoughts to flow in the
usual set patterns of fairness
he used to resolve his wort
ries, he wondered about the
sense of panic he had had Just
before coming up into the
world above. He considered
