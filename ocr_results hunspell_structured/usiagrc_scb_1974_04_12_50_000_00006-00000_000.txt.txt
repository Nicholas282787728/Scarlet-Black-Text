SGA: Constitution, Rights Debuted

by John Turnbull
This week‘s sparsely attended
meeting of the joint Boards del-
ved into the realms or constir
tutional amendments, srudenls'
rights and all-campus parties.

A series of proposals re'detln-
ing the roles oi hall presidcnrs
and vice presidents formed rhe
source of discussion concerning
amrndnienr to rhc existing stu-
dent Government C01 tution.
Two weeks before the mld'semi

(11 working in the Joint Boards
while a House Coordinator would
be responsible for the s lar-
mosphcrc of the hall. joint res"
ponsibilirics would include ad-
ministrarion of hell funds, in'
hall counselling and keeping up
with hall opini s and activities.
A proposal clL-li aiing these gui-
delines w-is 'prcscnred ar the
meeting by Ellen Ya cknin, acling
for rhc Role Defining Committee.

While Yac‘min was busy hands
mg out these proposals, sat
President John Hlnsen wis busy
handing out his own. Hansen's
document was basically the same
as Yacknins . ve for rhrcc plr
inrs. One of those was the idea
of hill officers having Joint du-
nus; Rick Faust spoke against
such a system idvoeiving rhata
total separation of duties would
allow each person to become
more involved in their own cun-
ccrns as much as they wanted
to, bul no one else sharivd his
opinion and the idea was kept.

Space tor this cnrinon was donnted to KDiC-FM and sold through the KDIC Shident-i-‘nculty Auction.
