. Synopsis ,‘
THE VILLAGE FETE,

The traditional English May-day was the time for much inerr-inrcnt and
gayety, when all the village assembled to share in choosing the Queen and in
escorting her to the rustic throne. where she was crowned. ,

The dancers entered with the Tidesnell Processional. which takes its
name from the village in which it was first used. The lllilkinalds, who wound
the Illaypole. the little children, gay in holiday dress. the Swordsmen, Archers,
and Villagers who danced the English country dances. all threw cztre awe ;
and the traditional Hobby I—Iorse, Jaelr o'Grcen and Jester capered about in
high glee. The Morris dancers, decorated with gay ribbons, and with bells
tinlrling, were prominent in every English Fete. The Morris men were profes<
sional dancers who went through careful training before appearing in public.
The dance steps were a manifestation of strenuous vigor. rather than grace.

"he Morris dances were brot to England by the lloor-slduring the Middle
Ages.

At the close 06 the village revels, Robin Hood and his men announce the
little play which is given, “In the Fairy Dell”, for the entertainment of the|
Villagers

IN THE FAIRY DELL.

Music—"Midsummer Night's Dresm"—Grinnell Orchestra.
Sylvia, the spirit of the Woods, Equ hell Wood Nymphs, come to the dell:
in Sherwood Forest, and make it beautiful with garlands and mosses. The}
Fairies, led by their queen, Titania, dance in with spring blossoms, which they ‘
scatter about. They are frightened by the appearance of Fuck and his merry
little Elves, who tumble about in high glee. The Elves are interrupted in thelrl
play by the coming of Robin Hood and Maid Marion. who are passing through
thn dell on their \l’fty to the Village church to be married. When they stop
to rest, the mischievous Puck sends one of his Elves fur a flower with which
to cast a. spell over Maid Marion. The effect of this ﬂower is to make her
drowsy, and unun awakening, she falls in love With the ﬁrst man she sees.
The first pussei'hy happens to be Friar Tuck, on his way to the church. Much
confusion follows, while Puck enjoys the mischief he has Wrought. Soon the
friends of Robin Hood and Main Marion come through the dell, on their Wzty
to the wedding, and are amazed at what they See. The watching fairies bring
their queen. who removes the spell which Puck has cast, Maid Marion realizes
hcr ﬁckleness and returns to her lover. All ends happily, and Robin Hoodl
and Maid Marion, led by the happy fairies and attended by their friends,

continue on the way to the wedding, followed by the hilarious villagers.
