Gary Cooper Wants to Come Back
for 1929 Homecoming, Crouch Says

BY JOHN l‘AXNIN

"Rooms are all taken!
care of your car lieiel
let this plane land! Don't crowd!
Isn't lie gorgeous? Please autograph
lllyil Are you here to see the root-
ball game or 7 Introduce me! ('an
I have this dance?"

Why all that? Why because Gary
Cooper plans to fly back for home-
coming ‘next tall, and those are only
a few of the exclamation: that will be
littered time and tirue again during
his slay. If Gary isn't busy milking
pictures, and returns [0 his Alma
Mater, the Grinnell-Wushington foot-
ball game on Homecoming (lily, Oct.
19, 1929, won't be the only attraction
of the day that undoubtedly will draw
the largest homecoming crowd in
Gril'Irlell‘s hislom'.

(‘oopcr Talks to High Schools

Bill Crouch, ’26, personal represent-
ative oi Grinnell’s "Cowboy Frank
Cooper," is here for commencement,
and yesterday he started gossip when
he said that “Coop” hopes to be on
the "old campus grounds" next fall.

“Gary cares a lot for Grinnell, and
he has shown it by speaking before
California high schools in an effort to
obtain a student in come here next
fall on the scholarship that the Cali»
fornia Grinnell Men's club has provid-
ed. Orville Routt, Henry Lyman and
Cooper compose the committee to se-
lect the high school graduate.

“At Hollywood high school we fig-
ured that thirty or forty would turn
out to hear Cooper’s plea, but when

Iowa Still Barred

From Conference

IOWA CITY. — The University of
Iowa still remains outside the Big Ten,
with the status quo ‘practically
unchanged, as charges of profes-
Sionalism in athletics have failed of
substantiation. Town has now been
exiled train the Western conlerence
for two weeks, and her plea for rein-
statement at a Chicago meeting Tues-
day night was overruled with the state-
ment that a considerable period must
elapse before she will have proved
her good iaith. Doyal Plunkitt and
Robert Spradling, basketball stars ac-
cused of being paid for their services,
were united in aidrming Iowa's inno-
cence and in pointing an accusing
.ongcr at Purdue.

Couch Case Speaks.

ZPurdue has as yet made no reply,
but her indictment has been supported
thy Coach Case of the Frankfurt, In—
idlana, high school. Frankfurt is the
"native city of Plunkitt and Spritdling,
and the home oi many state cham-
:pionship basketball teams, coaches
from almost all the Big Ten universi-
ties attended the tournament there last
year, according to Case, presumably
twith ulterior motives. - Case was
lhmught into the argument by an ac-
mitigation. originating from Purdue,
:thst his credits irom Iowa were :twctrd-
‘ed as a reward rcr his kindness in
«directing Plunkitt and Sprcdling toA
'ward the old gold and black institu»
mion. , ,
Bmlllllan, Inner Tnuieil About.

Meanwhile laws is kept busy deny—
ing charges from all quarters. Bresna-
han, track coach, refuses to acknow-
ledge certain letters which hear his
signature, and has set a detective to
ﬁnd their origins. A rumor that ath-
letic supplies are bought at boosted
prices, with the understanding that the
premium is to aid Iowa athletes, was
nuicted by the assertion that all sup—
plies are bought under a competitive
bidding system. Edward Lauer, di—
rector oi athletics, denies thathc plays
the rule at “alumni dummy," and
promises to show that the Department
of Athletics is completely under the
control of himscli and the faculty.

Iowa's probable course will be to
let matters rest until fall, when an.
other plea. icr reinstatement will he
made.

into four figures. He lives with his
parents, Judge and Mrs. c. H. Cooper,
in Hollywood.

"Cooper's rise in the motion picture
world is acknowledged as the most
sensational of any young actor. Three
years this coming August he entered
the proiession, and at present he re-
ceives an an average of 20,000 fitn let-
ters a month, with a, minimum of three

O Brien Will Reprint
Hall Tanager Story

The Tanager, Griunell's literary
magazine, has been honored by haw
ing one of its stories selected to ap-
pear in “The Best short stories of
1929." 'The story is "Fame lor cur.
Beatty," written by James Norman
Hall and published in the May issue
or the Tanager, Announcement of the
selection appears in a letter received
by Wayne Gard, editor of the Tan-
ager, from Edward O‘Brien, who edits
the series of yearly anthologies and
who now lives in Locarno, Switzer—
land.

Since Mr. O'Brien reprints only
about iiitcen stories a year from Arn-
erican magazines altogether. to have
a story included in his collection is
regarded as a high honor, both for
the author of the story and for the
magazine in which it first appeared.
llr. O'Brien has been indexing Tan-
ager stories for several years, andl
has starred many of them as having
unusual merit.

Two or Jay Sigmund's stories,
which appeared first in the Tanager,
were reprinted this month in 3 vol-
ume of Slgmund's poems entitled
“Merged Blood" and published by the
Maizellnd press in Des Moines. Last
year the Tanager was reprinted in
ﬁve important volumes, including
Carl Sundburg's “Good Morning, Am—
erica" and Braithwniie‘s “Anthology
or Magazine Verse."

Mrs, John Canning and Mrs. P. n.
Hynes or Albia were Grinnell college
visitors Thursday.

Mrs. Walter Lutz and soil of Des
Moines accompanied Elizabeth Lutz
