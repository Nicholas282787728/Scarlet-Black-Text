VP ru n-off today

hy Dung Sclililt’l.

Although only two candidates
are in today’s vice presidential
runrott, the closeness of
Tuesday's election raised some
question among the SGA cabinet as
to whether another participant
should be included in the runoff.

in Tuesday's voting, Bob Han-
dler received 123 votes out of a
total 488, for 26 per cent. Mark Sch-
wartz received 102 votes or 20.9 per
cent; Lei Ann Marshall had 94
votes or 19.2 per cent; Jeft Bob had
89 votes or 18.2 per cent, and
JoAnne Pyes had 67 votes or 13.7
per cent,

Matt Cohen, student coordinator.
said that because the top two vote~
getters combined did not receive a
majority oi votes, the cabinet had
contemplated including Marshall
in the run-oil today.

It was decided to run off two

instead for several reasons. First,
Cohen said, the tradItIon
established precedent is that only
two candidates participate in the
tinal runoll. Secondly, sineo Bob
received only tive votes less than
Marshall and Pyes only 12 votes
less than Bob, the cabinet cons
sidered it inappropriate to runotl
only three Candidates, rather than
tour or more.

Cohen said that the SGA con-
stitution does not provide any way
for dealing with election outcomes
of this nature. At an SGA meeting
Wednesday Cohen proposed more
stringent guidelines governing
elections and electioneering. His
proposal included a provision that
participants in a run-oft must be
those toprflnishers who in the
initial election, together, received
over 50 per cent.
