HEN the parties to a contract tail
to make plain to each other
theirinterpretation oi the relations
between themselves, serious inisun-
tierstandings are liable to result, We
will try and state, thereiore, our con.
ception or what the attitude or the
management oi this paper toward the
other parts oi Iowa College should he,
and incidentally what we think we
have a right to expect from them,

The management oi a college paper-
diners in sereral particulars iron: that
oi ordinary iournals. Politics, and we
have them in college. must not enter
into the college paper. Personal feel»
ing on the part oi the management
must be eliminated ir-oin its columns.
A college paper is never a private en-
terprise in any way, out belongs to the
student hotly. it is along these lines
that the present management intends
to operate. iiistahes will probabh

‘oconr, but Weu’ill endeavor to limit
each error to one appearance.

The faculty has a committee onsta-
dent puhlicatiuns This committee
will not he in rain so iar as the Strait
LET Axn litacn is concerned, [or we
hope to have its advice and help to did
us in mating this paper the beat erer.

Now in regard to w at iie con de
our fellow SLutlBiliS' attitude (I) i (l
us should be.

We think there arc at least tiiiee
unis in which the student body can
support iis paper. l«‘irst comes the
plu‘Eiy in alistlc matter of sub

student to subscribe ior hirneeli hut
