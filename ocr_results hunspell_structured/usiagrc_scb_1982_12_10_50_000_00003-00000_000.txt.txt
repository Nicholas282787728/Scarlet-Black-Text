The highlight of the winter excursion. of
curse. is being stranded in Fargo when
the wind chill factor is 100 degrees below
ero Nothing leaves the terminal, not the
uses, not the victims; only the vending

achine people manage to brave the

eather t0 restock the supplies of cheese
crackers with plastic peanut butter. If one
s stranded long enough, generally two
ays, the Red Cross breaks out a bucket of
he Colonel’s and sends someone to lead a
'ingralong.

The longest I‘ve ever been stranded was
'hen I was In Butte, Montana, when
Vlount St. Helens erupted. Contrary to
opular belief Washington did not receive
ny ash (parts of It did flood, however);
'utte did fall victim and I ended up
lestltute, tap dancing in the streets at 2
rm. (mambo time, remember“, while
arts of the Cascade Mountain range fell
ike snow about me, Again, Red Cross, the
olonel’s, sing7alongs, and, eventually,
odgings that are the Butte equivalent of
ur own Hotel Park.

Despite the old men who do not bathe,
he Nazis, the Mormons, the stretch pants,

e disasters, the organs that are jarred
oose, one can manage to keep a cheery
-'sposition. While traveling through Hus
wilight zone visions of purgatory, this
and of National Enquirers and folksy

RA types, all you need are your wits,
ense of humor, and heavy sedatives.

Bon voyage, amigos.

i do. We all have an obligation to do what
e believe is right. 7 Sincerely Janette

Many times we have talked about the

bout your possible sentence and how
ou’ll get to Omaha during finals week.
hrough it all you’ve repeated that even

ough you‘re scared, you're still glad you
alked into strategic Air Command with

e rest of us, and that you’d DO IT AGAIN
ND AGAIN it given the opportunity.

Weekend
tlneun

Breakinst ut Tlriauy's ilesll

Based on Truman Capote's classic
novel. creakiast ut Tillauy's is this
weekend’s best pick Starring o young
Audrey Hepburn as the pleasureseeking
Holly Golightly and George Peppard as the,
nice guy, this film captures the appeal ai d
charm of the novel, despite several Slgnlflr
cant changes in the plot line.

Most remarkable about this picture is
the attention given to the development of
characters. Holly is a 15~year-old Texas
runaway who eventually finds herself in
New York City bar-hopping and seeking
diversion from her otherwise meaningless
life, Holly's favorite diversion soon
becomes window-shopping at Tiffany’s
where she is able to forget her downrandr
out life amidst the splendor and elegance
of this famed jewelry store

George Peppard plays an Eastern lvyr
league college graduate who appears"
somewhat less than successful in the fast-,
paced New York City business world. The
addition of Peppard adds a new dimension
to the film and to Holly's character.

Everything about this film, from the off
beat decor of Holly’s apartment (a bathtub
Cut in half serves as her sofa) and her
naive relationship with a Sing-Sing heroin
trafficker who uses her to further his
”business," helps to make Breakfast at
Titrany's purely enjoyable from beginning
to end, a film not to miss.

The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)

For mose already familiar with Clint
Eastwood films, The Outlaw Josey Wales
offers few surprises. Josey Wales
(Eastwood) is a stereotypical Western
hero: callous and gruff on the surface but
honorable and gallant underneath.

The,film opens as Northern prevCivil
War guerillas destroy Josey's farm and
kill his wife and children. For revenge,
Josey allignes himself with the Southern
fighters. However, he is soon disillusioned
by this two-sided battle, and he crusades
on his own to avenge the indignities and
strife that the war has brought on his fami-
ly and comrades.

In the process, Eastwood is joined by
Chier Dan George, a wise but humorous
American Indian. This relationship adds
comedy and action to the film, and is one of
its best aspects.

The Western setting of Josey Wales
allows Eastwood to be more than a tough-
skinned renegade, as he is often portrayed
in other films, He emerges, rather, as a
reminder of the true American hero who
helped “build the West." Because of this
somewhat more sensitive Eastwood role,
Josey Wales' is a film which can be enjoyed
by more than just die-hard Clint Eastwood
movie fans. .

My Bodyguard (1980)

Under the direction of Tony Bill, My
Bodyguard combines comedy, drama and
superb acting to create a realistic por-
trayal of adolescent problems and modern
American family life

While based on the familiar “new kid in
town” motifI this film succeeds in adding a
new twist to an old story. After weeks of
being bullied by a high school gang, the
pint- -sized new Student, Clifford (Chris
Makepiece), asks the biggeststudent In his
class, Adam Baldwin, in act as his
bodyguard. The relationship which
develops between the two becomes one of
the focal points of the film, as each boy
confesses his weaknessu and recognizes
the ”truth” of adult life,

Clifford’s family life is also explored, but
in a much lighter way with Martin Mull
playing his tather and Ruth Gordon as his
eccentric grandmother,

These two plot lines make My
Bodyguard a light-hearted but nonetheless
meaningful film, enjoyable for any movie-
goer.
