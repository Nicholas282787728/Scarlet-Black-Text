Prof Builds Accelerator
in Basement

Hy May-lee cliai '

Assistant Professor of Physics, Jack
stone, Jr. is currently at work assembling
an electrostatic accelerator in the base
ment or the science building,

“It's a small accelerator for ac-
celerating charged particlessions," he exA
plained.

Stone designed it himself last spring and
received 2 370.000 grant from a private
foundation to put it together. He was able
to buy some parts from various companies
but others had to be specially designed.

“What actually is the accelerator is just
this little piece down here [shown in the ac-
companying photo]. It was bought come
mercially. This whole apparatus is an
atomic beam apparatus," he gestured the
length of the machine

“It will be going this summer, rm ques»
tions about that. in some ways it’s all
ready to go.” said stone, The accelerator
is complete but ”the atomic beam ap»
paratus has to be assembled as I get a little
time." he said.

He acknowledged that “the accelerators
you usually read about in the paper are
things two miles long or the size oi a small
city. Their purpose is to accelerate [a par»
ticle] to as high an energy level as possible
to look at a scale small like a nucleus."

“But here we have a different purpose.

We're looking at things like interactions iii-
volvlng the electronic structure of an
atom; it's a much greater scale." con-
tinued Stone.

"Our problem is to get a reasonably low
energy level. So there is a considerably dlls
ferent motivation and purpose from what
you think of irom the paper." he said,

Stone said the first experiment will In
volve collisions during which a hydrogen
atom with an extra electron, or a hydrogen
ion. collides with some target gas. This

produces a hydrogen atom with a very exs *

cited electron far away from the nucleus

“[Thus.] the size of the atom is
something comparable to a small
biological system like a bacteriophage 7
but I'm not interested in ones quite that
large." he said,

Students will be directly involved in a
variety of ways. according to Stone, Those
working in the Physics Department over
the summer and doing independent pros
jects will be first in line to make use of the
apparatus. However. he ieels itis probable
that additional Students will have this op-
portunity as well.

”It may be actually incorporated into an
advanced lab. There are a number of
research prolects that can be done with
this device, all involving the theme of colli-
sions of ions." Stone said.

MAIN STREET WINE CELLAR

almost heauiolais-Iike wines to very intense, peppery, rich wines
with strong varietal characters. Sweet, late harvest alcohol wines
and blush wines are also produced from Zinfandel grapes. Enioy

THE PHYSICS OF HISTORY. .

Physics and history seem, at iirst
glance. to be as utterly unrelated as two
iields can be, No apparent connection ex-
ists between the behavior of subatomic
particles and the behavior of Atilla the
Hun. or between Newton's Laws of Motion
and Wilson's Fourteen Points.

For Grinnell's williston Physics pros
fessor Beryl Clotielter, however, the study
of the relationship between the two is a
way oi lite.

Professor Clotfelter earned his doc-
torate in physics irom the University of
Oklahoma, and has spent subsequent
years at Ohio state and Princeton studying
general relativity and cosmology. As
Clotfelter explained, Einstein's famous
and timely theory or relativity “serves as
the foundation for cosmic theory [by] ex
plaining gravitation, which is the domi-
nant force in the universe."

Cosmology is the study oi “the origin
and evolution of the universe," including
the birth and development of Earth.
Clotl'elter says that the field was entirely
speculative until approximately 20 years
ago.

”Now, he says, “we have enough infor-
mation to serve as a foundation for
reasonable theories."

Clotielter reports that though the
universe is approximately four billion
years old, the most exciting events in its
development probably occurred within the
first so minutes after the “Big Bang." He
adds, though, that the likelihood of ever be-
ing able to irrefutably prove these theories

Physics professor Robert Cadmus cons
ducted graduate studies in the field of
nuclear physics, studying such matters as
“the fundamental problems of how protons
react with nuclei." Thus his 1978 arrival at
Grinnell provided llttle reason for him to
think that he would spend his Grinnell
career as anything but a nuclearphysicist.
But a different fate was written in the
stars ‘

The Christmas of '73 brought much
speculation on the possiblity oi building a
new observatory as a tribute to Professor
Emeritus Grant 0. Gale. Cadmus, who
says he had dabbled in astronomy while an
undergraduate at Swarthmore, took an in-
terest in the tentative plans. Consequently.
the College took an interest in Cadmus as
its possible astronomer.

While funds for the observatory were be-
ing raised through outsideisources (no col-
lege monies were used for the projectl,
Cadmus engaged himself in building upon
his astronomical knowledge. As part of his
studies, he spent a summer at Iowa State
calculating the diameter of stars by
measuring the amount oi their light block-
ed by other bodies,

The Grant 0. Gale Observatory. located
at the north edge oi campus, opened ior
use in the fall of 1933 and has already been
utilized ior a number oi research projects.
The current project is the result ol'a three-
y ear NSF grant, with various other grants,
including one from NASA. aiding the
study. Under observation are a group of 35
"semisregular variable stars [whlchl
change brightness by physical
pulsations," while studying these pulsa-
tions. the researchers stumbled upon some
unanticipated data

Cadmus says that five of the stars in the
group. which were all determlned to be
carbon stars. demonstrated different
pulsation patterns than their noncarloon
counterparts. The long-range study will
hopefully yield conclusive evidence con
cerning the nature of these differences.

in addition. Cadmus and a group of
students are collaborating with Iowa State
and the Ulllvchlty of Colorado in a study
