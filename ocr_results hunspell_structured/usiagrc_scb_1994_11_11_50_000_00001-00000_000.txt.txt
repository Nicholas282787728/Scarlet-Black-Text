XPLODING firecrackers in
E Loose Hall Tuesday morn
ing caused a small fire and
the evacuation of residents at 4:05
am. The incident, coupled with an-
other small fire in Cowles Hall over
the weekend, brings the number of
arson-related incidents at Grinnell
College since mid-July to 14.

Tuesday’s ﬁre inLoose caused a
twoinch strip of damage to one of
the walls on the south side of the
dorm. The weekend ﬁre in Cowles
was apparently started when a ﬂier
taped to the door of the south entry
was ignited. Damage in that incident
wasalso minimal,accordt’ngto Grin-
nell Fire Chief Jerry Barns.

But though none ofthe incidents
involved a ﬂammable liquid or were
large in magnitude or property dam-
age, Barns and college officials are
conccmcd.

Barns, who has been head of the
GrinnellFireDeparttnentsince 1987.
said that he does not recall any other
time when their have been so many
intentional “vandalism" ﬁres at the
college.

"These (14) ﬁres have all been
waste-basket or flier ﬁres that have
been intentionally set," he said. “It's
vandalism. When someone sets a
door flier that’s taped to the glass on
fire, it‘s not going to catch the metal

Dean of Student Affairs Tom
Crady called the incidents “serious"
and “very dangerous." He said that
the college is currently working
closely with the Fire and Police Dc-

Finding evidence in the case of
arson, however, can be difficult.

”When your evidence goes up in
flames, it‘s often difficult to catch the
person or people responsible,” Barns
said.

TheFireandPoliceDepartmems
are currently pursuing some leads.

 

Barns said. He hopes that any Stur
dents with inforrnatton will come
forward to help in the search.

“At this point, what it's going to
take is for someone to reveal some-
thing,“ he said. “From my cxpcn:
ence in cases like this, somebody
always knows sometlting, whether
it‘s a roommate or girlfriend that the
person has confided in."

Anyone with information about
the ﬁres can contact the Grinnell Fire
or Police Department. Barns said.
He also said that anyone not wanting
to go to Grinnell authorities can call
the National Arson Hotline at 178007
532—1359. The hotline offers up to
$10,000 rewards for information
about ﬁres.

Sony grant will enable college to produce CD—roms

5450,000grantoverthe next
A three years will help the

college audio visual Center
keep up with ever-changing technolr
ogy in the growing world of multir
media.

The grant, a gift of the Sony
USA Foundation, was awarded last
spring in response to a proposal sub-
mitted by the college.

Much of the money will be used
to bring computers and other audio
visual equipment like still photogra-
phy, video and sound together in a
desktop video work station, accordr
ingto AVCenterDirectorlvan Perry.

“Essentially, we wanted the col-
lege to be able to handle the presen-
tation and production of the kinds of
applications that go along with a
mulLi-media presentation," he said.
“The focus of the grant was to try to
outﬁtthecollege with equipmentthat
can be applied to the point where
computers and audio visual merge.“

Though the grantmoney will be
used for various projects across cam-
pus, the centerpiece of audio visual
improvements will be the desktop
video work station, Perry said.

The ﬁrst Work station will be
assembled and ready for use by the
end of this semester. Perry hopes to
eventuallyequipthecollegewith four
stations at various locations around
campus.

The desktop video work station

will allow thecollegetoproduce CD-
rorlts, I‘e.

“Images, both still and moving,
and sound can be mixed together
with text in an interactive digital {or-
matonapetsonalcomputer,”hesaid.
“We will have Ihe ability to make a
presentation ofa large size and to put
it on a compact disk, which can be
played in any CD mm across cam-
pus."

.otzl.

The grant will also enable the
college to put several overhead moni-
tors into the computer lab and to

equip ARH room 224 with a large

. ,euiiot‘. system, which
can display video, graphics or any-
thing found on a Macintosh com-
puter.

Rear screen projection creates a
clear image, even when classroom
lights are on, Perry said.

But not everyone will be able to
use the new equipment, at least not
yet.

Becauseof the complexity of the
desktop video work station, a trained
staffof students will actually use the

equipment. mostly forprojects offac-
ulty members, ' : least in the begin-
ning, Perry said.

“We won’t preclude students
from having an idea, but primarily
we willbe using it for faculty projects
that already exist," he said

The most exciting thing about
the new equipment, however, will be
the fact that it exists, Perry said.

“It's here now and it’s technol.
ogy that students will have to deal
with in their lives," he said. “It's
going to be an important tool."
