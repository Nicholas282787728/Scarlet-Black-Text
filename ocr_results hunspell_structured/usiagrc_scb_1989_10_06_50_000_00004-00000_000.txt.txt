Training in the Use of Leisure

By Andrew Hamilton

Ever wonder what Hurling would
look like with four all-glass outside
walls? Or what the campus mightbc
like if Eighth Avenue were closed
off and a science wing were ex-
tentkd to cross the road'.7

These, and other architectural
wonders are being offered-up to the

imagination at the exhibit “Grinnell I

Architecture: Campus Plans and
Drawings“ in the Print and Drawing
Study Room of Burling Library.

The collection of plans, prints and ,

drawings portrays Grinnell College
the way it was, might have been, is,
and very well may be. The pieces
date from the pre-cyclone years to
the 1983 Dover Plan. It is a ﬂight of
fancy to see the early campus, com-
plete with a fountain, transform into
the Campus of Tomorrow, and to
imagine all the possible variations
which might have occurred if differ
out plans had been followed along
the way For example. what if the
proposed Building for the Training
in the Use of Leisure had been con-
structed? What are the implications
of such a structure?

Other items of interest include a
copy of the 1868 drawing of the
campus as it stood before the cy-
clone, the 1949 “Campus of Tomor»

Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure,

row," and the 1958 developmentplan
drawn up by the architectural firrrt
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill for
the College.

Also on exhibit in the Hurling
gallery is“Remaking America: New
Uses, Old Places.” This intriguing
show documents the renovation of
select old buildings into new usable
spaces, Some of the pieces which
demand attention — at least by vir—
tue of their titles — include “From:
Waiting Place for Cemetery Moum-
ers,To: Headquarters of the Historic

Landmarks Foundation of Indiana,"
and “From: Brewery, To: Retail and
Restaurant Complex.” A few of the
better-known buildings in the col-
lection include the Fine Arts Build-
ing of Los Angeles and the Palla-
dium.

The show brings up many images
of the past But it also carries a
message of the present It is encour-
aging to view this evidence that a
throw-away society is able to use the
packaging of oldbuildings more than

Real Sisterhood, Born in Flames

Ten years have passed since the
social democratic revolution in the
United States and women are still
outsiders The old pau‘iarchy is still
in power, but with a different name
for the sexist racist and heterosexist
structures. Under this continuing
oppression women pull together in
an effort to protect themselves.

This is the reality that Lizzie Bor-
den’s 1983 movie, Born in Flames,
describes.

Her main characters are women:
black and white, lesbians and none
lesbian, middle- and working—class
The movie addresses the divisions
that keep these women from helping

one another. But in an ultimate
feminist fantasy the women unite,
with women protecting each other
from the violence of patriarchal
society through the underground
Women’s Army. In how many
movies can you see men who are
attacking a woman be chased away
by a group of women on bikes?
The story of the Women‘s Army
is told from several viewpoints be-
sides that of the women themselves:
a white feminist group discusses the
Women’s Army; the media repons
on groups of women on bicycles
who ride around auacking men on
the streets for no apparent reason;
the government keeps tabs on the
women and through its intnrsive

oppressed group and the splits be-
tween feminists.

But these serious messages are
delivered in a way that allows us to
fantasize about real sisterhood
among women.

something else instead.

Let's say it‘s about two workers in
a chemical factory, both of whom
are named Bill, and their pet squir-
rel, Ted. The trio go to visit their
cousin at a small Midwestem liberal
arts college, thus embarking on what
turns out to be a voyage of self-
discovery.

They make a wrong turn in Lan-
