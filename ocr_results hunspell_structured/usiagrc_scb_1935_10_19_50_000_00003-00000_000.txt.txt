Ann Arbor, Mich, (AC?)—
Work. for the night is fleeting. and
you Won't be this young forever.

That would seem to be the les-
son i to be learned from the
“achievement batting average" re-
cently computed by Dr Harvey
C. Lehman ct Ohio university. a
compilation which shows that the
most important work in science
and literature is done by men
their early youth,

Outstanding achievements in
chemistry. physics. short-story
writing and other fields of crear
tive work were used by Dr. Leh-
man as basis for his “batting aver
age." He counted each year of life
as one time at bat. with each ini-
portant contribution a “hit”.

in

ThirtyJive is the big year for
production, Dr. Lehman found, al-
though important “hits" were reg-
istered by men as young as 18 and
as old as as. Astronomers don't
run true to form. however, They
reach their most productive years
between 40 and 44.

Chemists reached their highest
batting average between the ages
of 27 and 39, physicists were tops
between 30 and 34. and master»
minds in mathematics between 28
and as,

If you're a short-story writer.
you’d better be good after your
30th birthday and before your
34th. or you may never get any
place. and if you lean toward poet-
ry, you may expect to be at your
best between 22 and 35.

ventor Thomas Alva Edison as a
