COUNCIL CALLS SPECIAL
MEETING TOMORROW NOON

Reorganization May Extend To ,

Board. T

Plans for the complete rcorganiza,
tion of the student government sysl
ten: are to be considered at a speciali
meeting of the student council tomor-T
row alter-noon in Rodin 23, ARH at
1:00 o'clock. Although the question
of reorganization has been under con-
sidcration for some time, no definitcl
plans have been considered, council
members said today. it is understood
that the reorganization may even in—
clude the Women's Lcaguc board 'and
the Men's Senate, if a workable plan
that will bring the two bodies to,
gather can be devised. Members to-
morrow will come prepared to presentl
proposals for the form the new body
should take. ‘

it has long been thought by stud» ,
cnts that the council should either be‘
reorganized and extended, or else_
should be dropped. The present ac-i
tivities of. the council are practicallyl
limited to the apportionment of the;
income derived from the student som-i
ester fee, and the appointment of all».
college dance committees. The coon-i
cil has been called a figurohead forl
the past few years, and members have
decided to submit plans for a reor-'
ganization to broaden its scope and
its influence, or else to dissolve the
organization. ,

Dean Nollen in Guinnell to Confer
With Movement Heads »«
Is Pleased.

"Organization for endowment work
in Chicago is going along in splendid
shape,” is the way Dean J. S. Nollen
described the work of alumni in Chic
cago. "Greater obstacles are met in
Chicago than perhaps in any other
city because of the great Size of the
city with respect to the number of
alumni there."

Doan Nollcn returned yesterday
from Chicago to confer with President
Main and other local directors. There
are about 180 alumni in Chicago, ac-
cording to Nollen, and all are beingl
organized into groups so that every
Grinnellianlcau have a part in the
drive. No actual subscriptions have‘
been solicited so far, the work being
entirely confined to organization and
publicity work.

Fred Blockington, '92, has been
appointed chairman of the alomnr

 

To be Student Spokcsrmru ,
it has been felt that there should

be some body which should be in di-
rect contact with both the faculty and'
the student body, and which would he‘
prepared to represent student needs
and suggestions or an official manner-l
before the faculty. The organization‘
of the college rnto divisions mr‘rde up
of the Women's life and the men’s life,
-has lessened the rmporance of a body
reprcscnhng the two together, and]
has thereby lessened the power or thel
student council. , College traditions
have been enforced by upper-classmcn,
and only general classroom activities
have been left to the jurisdiction of
the Council, with the result that its
present power is somewhat indefinite.

Student opinion apparently favors
,an organization of the Men’s Senate
and the W. s. G. L. Board into ai ht
council for general supervision of
student affairs. The work of the
League Board at the Quadrangle, and
the work of the Senate at thenormi-
tories would be under the supervision

. of the respective bodies. not general
topics concerning the student body or
college in general would be under the
jurisdiction of the joint body which
might be known as the Student Coun-
cil.

'TE basis of membership in the
council is another subject to be de-
Cided. Whether student council mem-
bers shoull be chosen with regard to
class, or with regard to place of resi—
dence, or by some other system is of
much importance to the proper func-
tioning of the body.

MRS. TUCKER IN
RECITAL TODAY

Mrs. Collingwood Tucker, coming to

Grinnell under the auspices of the
Entl'e-Noiis club, appears in an in-
formal recital of old planmtiou melo-
dies at the Quadrangle, this alternuon.

nent of the old negro songs and has

gram will beamply illustrated with

scriptions of their manner of singing.
She appears without uncompanist,
and gives the songs in their true mim-
ner. and in the various dialects of the
south.
_ Tea will be served by the members
of the Club. following the recital.
An admission fee of fifty cents
will be charged ,tbe proceeds to go
to the club’s endowment pledge.

Trip to Western coast Proves
Value of Example Set by‘
Student Work. :

President Main is in Gi'innell again.
returning yesterday from 8. trip of
over a. month to the Pacific Coast in
behalf of Gl'iiinell interests. While in

tant city, and reports that enthusiasm
is rising in favor oi the endowment
work on the coast,

"Alumni in the west are 100% he
bind the Movement, both in spirit and
in desire to contribute," he stated to
a reporter today. "I met hundreds of
graduates, both of old and of more re—
cent classes, and without exception
they expressed great enthusiasm for
the work we are undertaking."

Thai. the Contention that. work on
the campus Would he a. great factor
in arousing peoplemore distant from

by the fact that the news of local
student and town activities hﬂd pre-
ceded him to the coast, and that

set by undergraduates.

Grinnell‘ Again Leads Bulldogs
at Half But Fails to
Keep Lead.

GAME LOST ON FAILURE
TO THROW FREE THROWS

Drake Fails to Get Field Goal
Entire First Half—
Payseur Hurt.

Luck of a dependable free thrower
resulted m the downfall uf‘,tirc bio
ncers at the hands of Drama here Map-
day evening in the closing contest of
the current season, 13 to ll.
Neither team was able to count a
field basket during the first ten min.
utes of play, at which time the count
stood 4 to 1 in Drake's favor. All
or the points had been the result of
free throws.
With the first period more than half
over, Crinncll rallied Evans tossed
a pretty ringer from a corner of the
floor and Whitchili counted at free
throw. tying the scor'c at 4 all. Then,
just before the half ended, "Chief"
Wintcr, to the surprise and delight of
the many onlookers, picked the hall
ofr the backboard, dribbled the length
of the floor, and dropped a neat‘count-
er, making the total 5 to 4 in thc Pio—
neel's' favor. There the count re—
mained until the end of the half.
Only Free Tlu-ows For Drake
The guarding of both teams had
been unusually strong thus‘far, but
the Crinnell five had been superior.
Drake was unable to count a single
goal from the floor. her entire four
points being the result of Payseur’s
ability from the foul line, - ,
nrakc opened the second perio
with a rally which put them far
enough in the lead to win. Bayseur
tossed his fifth foul, and Shawvcr
dropped in a field counter which put
the Bulldogs in the lead '1 to 6, Smith
and McKinley counted long shots
within the next few seconds, bringing
the Drake load up to 11-6. Crinneil
was not going at top speed. The pass
ing of the Pioneers was crrati , and
the forwards were iir‘rablc to locate
the basket. Payseur attempted a long
sirot, then followed in and counted
a short basket, bringing the Drake ~
loud to 7 points.
Sﬁll Hull Chance , .
With but eight minutes left to play,
the Pioneers thieatcned to overcome
the advantage of the Bulldogs and
pull the contest out of the fire, Was
senaar went in for Whitehill at for—
ward, Macy takiug the former'S place
at guard. Fearing counted his first
ringer from the field, making it 13
to s, and Drake adopted a stalling
game. Fayscur and Shawvcr, both
Drake forwards, had been removed
from the contest as a résult of inc
juries, and The Bulldogs chose to
“play horse” and-hold the safe dead
they possessed. Wassenaax' broke
through for another field basket, howA x
aver, making it 13 to lo, and tossed a
tool which raised it to 13 to 11. The
rally came too late, however, for be—
fore the Pioneers could count again
the final gun exploded both its cart-
ridge and the hopes of Crinncll fans
for a win.
