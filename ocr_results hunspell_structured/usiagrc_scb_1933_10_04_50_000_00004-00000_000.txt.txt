John C. Truesdaic, head of the 3th»
letic department, scouted the State
Teachers>cornell football game at
Cedar Falls last weekend, and reports
that the Tutors, although lacking in
experience, will probably develop in-
to one of the strongest teams ln the
state. Coach Johnny Baker, who was
formerly an all-American guard for
the Southern California grid telm.
has initiated the szu'ner system to
his cohorts, and they seem to be tilk»

ing it in great shape.

Here is what Ossie Salem bad to
say about ollr awn Albert "Tarzan"

Rose. ”If you enjoy your grunts at

a football game, get a close-up

ticket some day when this boy

nose is backing up the Grilulell
line, mull listen to the opposing
books when they collide into this
big curly-headed youngster." He
also says that nose is good enough
to play defensive fullback on any
conference team in the country. he
garding the entire Grinnell team,
he states, “Don’t shed tears over
any team that ever comes out of
that town of Grinnell. They may
not always .win, but nobody ever

gets away from them without a

Several days ago we went to all
the trouble of having action pictures
taken of some of the Pioneer grid
luminaries, and imagine our em-
barrassment when going to the phoe
tographer’s to get the prints, the
camera, plates and all equipment had
been lost strayed or stolen. The latter
explanation seems to be coriect,'for
when the plates were found, several
of the town's youthful clan had
made use of the plates as slates, but
being unable to work the complicated
lenses, had discarded the camera. We
bet that Bradley never expected his
face to be chalkqmlrked without
.baving something to say about it.

Although there i ll be no inter—
collegiate crosseootntry competi-
tion this year, several interested
members of last year's team have
announced that spetiul cross-coun-
fi-y events for iiitra-couege compe-
t’ltion will be held throughout the
season. Equipment .vill be issued
by the college, and it is possible
that numerals and ribbons wiu be
presented to the various men who
take part in the contest. doc Preli—
for, Toni Gordon and Art Mellrctli,
.iill members of last season's chain]?
ionsllip barrier organization, will
offer instruction to ncw men.

The first race will be held the last
week in October, and the season wul
be climaxetl with a crossecountry
event in the fall track meet. it is
hoped that other races will be added
to the schedule, We have noticed that
several freshmen have been surprised
that Gtinnell does not have varsity
competition in this sport_so are we.

Of all the ways in which

tobacco is used the cigarette
is the mildest form

OU know, ever since

the Indians found out
the pleasure of smoking to—
bacco, there have been many
Ways of enjoying it.

But of all the Ways in
which tobacco is used, the
cigarette is the mildest form.

Another thin gicigdrettes
are about the most conve-
nient smoke. All you have
to do is strike a match.

Everything that money
can buy and everything that
science knows about is used
to make Chesterﬁelds.

The right home-grown
tobaccos—seasoned with just

enough aromatic Turkish
—are blended and cross-
blendcd the Chesterﬁeld
way.

Then the cigarettes are
made rightiﬁrm, well-
ﬁlledl Chesterﬁeld uses the
right kind of pure cigarette
paper.

There are other good ciga—
rettes, of course, but Chest-
erﬁeld is

the cigarette that’s
milder, the Cigarette
that tastes better.
Chesterﬁelds satisfy—
we ask you to try them.
