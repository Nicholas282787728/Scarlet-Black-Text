Last Sunday morning, many students woke
up expecting the announcement ofa new Stu-
dent Government Association Vice President/
President of Academic Affairs, but no such
notice was in their email lnrbox,

Under the “Results" tab of the SGA Elecr
from page on Pioneechb, there Has a brief
announcement that Election Board had re,
ceived a grievance and the results could not be
released on time. Later that evening, students
received election resu1257Rebecca Miller
‘05 won with with a brief preface that “the
24-hour gtiewrnce period ended last mghr at
midnight and the grievance the election board
received was not able to be considered due to
Article 111. Section 3B of the Bylaws of the
SGA Constitution. Therefore, the results can
now be released.”

But the actual story was a little more com—
plicated than the bricfcmail indicated.

At11:45 prm,715 minutes before the end
of the 24rhout grievance period for the SGA
VP/PAA runoff, a representative for candidate
Brrrce Barnum ‘05 arrived at the SGA ofﬁces
with a paper copy ofa grievance, The offices
were cmpry, said the representative. At 11:51
pm, the candidate's representative scnr an
email to the Chair of Election Board’s person-
al account, stating that he had a grievance in
hand and was currently in the SGA Offices.

Milcc Maloney ‘06, the Administrative
Coordinator and Chair of Election Board der
fended his absence saying "there is nothing in
rhe [SGA] constiturion that says 1 have to [be
in SGA offices]," he said. Maloney responded
to the email “shortly after" it had been sent, and

asked why the representative had not enclosed
an electronic copy with the email. Maloney’s
email was time-stamped after 1 am. Sunday.
At 2:38 am. he received an electronic copy.
Elecrion Board convened sunday evening,
and voted unanimously that “no grievance had
been filed," because it had arrived after midr
night, and the end of the 24-hour grievance
period.

"The best way to get a hold of someone
on campus is not to try to find them person—
ally," said Maloney, “ir is email.” irle said rhat
an email copy should have been
enclosed. According to Article
111, Section 313 of the SGA
Constitution, "[t]bc Election
Board may receive \vrittcn com-
plaints regarding rhe elecrion
procedure if delivered to the
Election Board chair within 24
hours after the election has been
held.”

Barnum was disappointed
that his griexmnce could not be heard. "[Elcc»
tion Board] should make every effort to hear-
grievances instead of just throwing chem our
on technicalities,"hc said “It would be nice to
see them actually follow the grievance primer
dures."

Other students raised issues with the selec-
tion of Election Board members, Several stu-
dents who had served on Election Board be-
fore were not asked to serve this year, though
Maloney said he emailed everyone on a list of
students who had been on Election Board in
previous years inviting them to be on Elccriou
Board.

“In an ideal situa
tion i think there
should be no
opportunity for
corruption of
Election Board."

Saraubh Saraf ‘05 was one of those sour
dents. Saral' had been on Election Board for
the past three years and was surprised not to
be included this year. “I assumed I would be
[back on the board],”hc said,“but I wasn’t in-
vited back." He also said that no general call
to the student body Was made tojoin Election
Board.

Maloney said that he contacted strrdents on
a list made by former SGA VP Andy Grimm.

Jacob Cram ‘06 was also on Election Board
last year and was not invited back this year. He
pointed out the committee as-
signmenrs are usually made by
seniority, and while this semes—
ter was his fourth semester as a
JB Senator and he picked Elec-
tion Board as his top choice,
he was assigned to a different
committee, Cram also said that
none of the current members of
the board sented with him last
year. “They are all brand new,“
be said.

Maloney sard that his girlfriend, sara
Moss ‘06 is on Election Board,butdenied hav-
ing personal relationships with other members
ofElcction Board. Other members ofElcction
Board include Moss’s next door neighbor Ryan
sterling “no and Sterling's former roommate
Ericd Williams ‘06, Sam Tang ‘07. the other
StudenteAt—Large on the Board, is Maloncy's
SA and was asked personally by Maloney to
serve on the board.

On a campus as small as Grinnell’s, ofr
ficial positions and personal relations often
coincide. Senator Abel Lornax ‘05 is a senator

representative on the Board and is currently
roommates with Doja Khandar ‘05, another
Cabinet Member. Ryan Felton ‘07 is the oth~
erJoint Board Senator on the Board. Cabinet
Member and ACE Coordinator Anne Salor
man “05 serves on the board by the Constitur
tron.

When asked about the previous Election
Board experience of the Stridents-Ar—Large
on the Board, Maloney pointed to Williams
and Sterling. "I believe they have been on be
fore," he said.

“I helped on an election last year," said
Sterling, “bur I guess technically I wasn’t
[on the board.]" None of the students at
large currently on the comrnirree were Board
members last year.

Election board was approved by Joint
Board meeting, earlier than usual in the se-
mester in order to get the Board operational
for the special VP election. In order to ap—
prove a board before fall break, Joint Board
voted to suspended the Golden Rule, which
usually requires that agenda items cannot be
voted on the same week they are introduced.
“No one even had time to look [the Board
members experience or relationships] up,"
said Cram.

While no students interviewed for this
article said that there was any specific cor-
ruption in the special election, many said they
were disturbed by the way this years Board
members were appointed and the manner in
which the grievance was dismissed. “In an
ideal situation I think there should be no ope
porruniry for corruption of Electron Board,"
Cram said.
