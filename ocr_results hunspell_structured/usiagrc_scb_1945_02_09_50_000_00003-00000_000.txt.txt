League Discusses

Wallace;Poweshiek,
Poli’rics Next Topic

Concluding that Henry Wallace
has a good chance of becoming
Secretary of Commerce when his
appointment comes up betore the
Senate March 1, Doris Marvin
explained to the League of
Women Voters Monday night the
conflict which has arisen over
the question of whether he should
be given this position.

The George bill, which was
passed by the Senate February
1. put an end to most of the op-
position to Wallace as Secretary
of Commerce by removing the
Reconstruction Finance Corpor-
ation, and the $6,795,000.000
worth of war factories it owns,
from the Department of Conn
merce, she said. '

Miss Marvin quoted the Chi»
cago Tribune in its statement
that Democrats who support
Wallace ”want. or are compla~
cent at the prospect of, a soviet
America." In contrast, she
pointed out that the Des Moines
Register called Wallace “a tri-
bune of the people, roughly 'com-
parable to William Jennings Brye
an and to Wendell Willkie after
his defeat in. 1940."

Local politics will be the sub
ject of the Joint meeting of
mwn and college leagues to be
held next Monday at 7:15 p. m,
in the quadrangle drawing room.
Those who are not league mem-
bers, as well as members, are in-
Vited to hear the discussion of
“Power in Poweshiek,” Barbara
Takahashi, president, said.

Papa. glared sternly at his
young hopeful. “Another bite like
that, young man,” he said, "and
you'll leave the table."

Sonny looked up, “Another bite
like that," he agreed. “and I’ll
be finished.”

We'd hate to be thought

But it annoys us for Wacs and

sentatives to visit the campus,
ltrying to recruit new Wacs or
Waves or nurses.

The attempt to draw
out of college into the services
works a double injury. as we see
it. It lowers the enrollments of
colleges which are already handi-
capped; and it takes women from
school_who would be much more
valuable to their country after
completing their college work.

‘College Women of Greater Utility As
Graduates In Service Organizations

are fighting, whose girls are do.
ing war work.

Furthermore, most college
women will be worth much more
to the nation after finishing their
college work than the extra time
will cost. Some branches of
service for women require col»
lege graduation for entrance. In
others, the more difficult and
important work is open only to
women who have finished col»
lege. ‘

Some recruiting officers for
women's services recommend that
women enlist after graduation.
We’ve no doubt that many col-
lege women plan to do just that;
and we've complete respect for
recruiting officers who encourr
age it, We have none for re-
cruiters who want women to
hurry into work they'll be bet
ter prepared for later.

For the sake of the peace, It's
important iust now to maintain
college enrollment, to prevent
sinall colleges from collapsing,
For the sake of both the war
effort and the peace, it's im-
portant to keep college women
studying. It's more important
than adding college undergrad-
uates to the rolls of women in
uniform. ——Associated Collegiate
