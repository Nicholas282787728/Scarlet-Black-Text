Campus theatergoers may think
of the numerous productions
throughout the semester mainly as
occasional weekend
tertainment, but for the actors and
technical crews which produce
them, the plays tend to border on
extracurricular careers, Next
Weekend, the theater department
will present Oliver Goldsmith's
She Stoops to Conquer. When the
current semester ends,

including the two major ones

Commenting on some of the
limitations of performance and set
design associated with the ar-
chitecture of the College's
theaters, Fischer noted the
necessity of selecting plays with a
minimum at major scene changes,
and of designing sets that can be
readily adapted from scene to

sequently is not arranged with

sophomore Mark Fischer, one or

have had something to do with six
of them.

Fischer describes his official
duties as “supervising the building
and maintenance of the sets" for
each play, and spends fifteen
scheduled hours per week in the
Scene Shop backstage in Roberts
Theater. As performance dates

.approach, however, that figure
may increase considerably. Ac-
cording to Fischer the behind the-
scenes preparation for a play is as

{much an organized team effort as
that of the actors, and requires a
comparable amount of planning
and coordination to arrange sets,
sound, lighting, and costumes.

Set building and rehearsals
usually get underway
simultaneously; for The Birds. the
semester’s iirst major production,
the building crew was at work
three weeks into the term. For that
production, Fischer was also the
stage manager and responsible for
seeing to it that both rehearsals

land performances ran smoothly
and on schedule, a job which
amounted to as many hours as
players spent in rehearsal (6:30-

Arena Theater has similar
drawbacks, leading planners to
devise more abstract and versatile
types of scenery. Fisher says,
though, that these restrictions may
be a positive intluence on
production in that they torce the
designers and crew to be more
ingenious and to rely on minor prop
additions and lighting techniques
to alter the atmosphere tor a
particular scene. This has
especially been true oi She Stoops
to Conquer, which requires several
scene changes.

Fischer emphasized that behind-
theescenes preparation tor a
production is far from a one-person
operation, and that much oi the
actual labor is done by members at
the Introduction to Stagecraft
class, students earning practicum

credits, and other interested and
motivated persons. In all, the stage
crew may number as many as
thirty people, with ten being the
usual size of the ”running crew”
which manages the props and sets
once the show opens,

As yet, Fischer, a theater major,
has not himself designed the sets
for any of the department‘s
productions, but is enrolled in the
stagecraft class and expects at
some time to plan and direct set
building for one of the plays. With
students designing sets {or about
one half at the theater productions
(faculty members design the
others), Fischer says the
possibilities for independent
projects in this area are good.

in general, he is optimistic about
the nature of the department and
its future. Although puzzled by the
administration’s rejection of a
recent course proposal which
would have added makerup design
to the theater curriculum, and
awaiting a decision as to whether
or not scenic design will be per-
manently added to the course
offerings (it was a special topics
course this semester), Fischer
contends that currently there is
ample opportunity for students,
both majors and nonrmajors, to
become involved in different
aspects of theater productions. He
characterizes the department as
one oi the most active on campus
and is encouraged by the number
of people working on their own
initiative to coordinate dramatic

presentations; next semester’s
plans include an entirely student
run production.

Despite the small number of
professors in the department
(three), Fischer says that there is
a favorable balance between
traditional and experimental
approaches to theater. providing
actors and technicians with op-
portunities to test both abstract
and straightforward techniques of
their respective trades. He also
sees the small college setting as
enabling more students to become
involved in department projects.
The chance of a student getting a
part in a play at some point in tour
years are much better here, he

says, than at most universities.
Fischer does not claim to be the
most vastly experienced of theater
department personnel, but in three
semesters he seems to have
acquired a fairly diverse
background in theatrical oc-
cupations, including make- -up,
lighting, set design, organization,
construction, and supervision He
is still waiting tor his break into
acting, and is not encouraged by
national employment sLatistics for
actors Nevertheless, he expects to
pursue his theatrical interests,
work in regional theater, and
eventually teach technical and
perhaps pertormance aspects of
theater at the high school level.
