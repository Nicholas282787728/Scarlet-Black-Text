HIGHER EDUCATION FnR WOMEN'

Just now there is considerable sen-
sation‘al tliscussion as to whether or
not higher education makes women
happier or of more use in the, wurlR,
One writer, more emphatic than otlr
ers, asserts that higher education
makes oltl maid aunts of us.

Be that as it may, one thing is as»
sured, the right kind of higher edllcar
tion enriches life, and’ to whatever-
adds to the fulucss anti cuioynient of
living we women have a right.

Education is of value, not so much
lor ihe incrc knowledge obtained in
these tour precious years, as because
of the keenness of sight which years
of study give.

Education is appreciation.

Education enables us to find lteen-
er delight in life, literature, art. and
science.

I stand before a painting of won-
droits merit, and perhaps 1 say it is
heautitul because some one has told
me that it is the work of a great mass
ter. But that painting irieans almost
nothing to mc it there is not within
myself a response which makes some
part or that. masterpiece my own.

Tire rippling of the forest stream
may he music to you and I may hear
nothing but the sound of drops at wa-
ter because you have music iii your
soul and I have none in mine.

Venice is hiit a word to me, a word
whose meaning is cnriched maybe by
my imagination of what the place
must be; but to the artist wlro has
studied Venice by night anti by day,
under sunshine and shadow, until he
has made the place a part of himself,
Venice stands for color, light, and
melody, and a glorious human cur
iletwor. ‘

Friendship means more to
cause I have been a friend.

Joy means more to me it I have
been glad.

Art is enriched for me it i have held
a brush, it I have seen some one else
mix his paints.

me because 1 have studied one

Every little thing that we learn on-

THE RECITAL éouRsz.

The programs of the Recital Series
of Hit year include master works of
unusual interest. Two great concerto:
have been admirably performed, the
Saint Saens‘ Concerto for piano. and
the Bruch G Minn for violin, also two
mmeillellts of the famous MendelsA
solrn Concerto for violin and the slow
movement from the Sindlng Plano cons
Cel‘to with Ol‘ClleStl‘le Darts arranged
for pipe organ.

In the Chamber Music Recitals it
was intended to illustrate in some de-
gree the historical development of
string qiiai-tette in the hands of the
three greatest masters of quartctte
writingiﬁayidn, Mozart anti Beelht}
vcn. Works for piano anti strings
have had a share in each program. A
string quartettc by Dvorak, the great
Bohemian composer, will he a feature
of the next Chamber Music Recital.
It is exceedingly modern anti marked
by the originality of rhythm and inel-
ody charactc ic of that composer.
The most interesting number yet
heard in piano recital, aside from the
concertos was the Liszt transcription
of “La Cauipaiicll iristt' woiidcrlul
technical brillmice was ﬁnely illus-
trated in llir. Spencer‘s playing of
this.

The variations for violin. the ﬁrst
number of Mr. Butler‘s program, are
of special signiﬁcance as Corelli was
the ﬁrst composer and play-er of real
violin music. The Bach solo sonatas,
from which the Chaconiie s taken, are
unique as practically the only success-
ful attempt 0( writing for the violin

of the country.
