bance"of his online statements and apologizes for any

Town businesses prepare for Super Wal-Mart

BRYAN BOYCE

The new big box store will force prices down for common goods, especially groceries, but

many area business owners think that they’ll be able to withstand the competition

The existing Wal-Marr

in Grinnell opened 20
years ago and com-
petes against other
businesses in a variety
oi areas, including:

- Limited groceries

- Lawn s garden
supplies

' Hardware & tools
' Bikes & accessories
' Shoes

. Office supplies

- Furniture

. Clothes

. Electronics

' Pharmacy

- Send-out photo ser-
vice & digital kiosk

The newWal-Mart
SuperCenter will otter
all oi the above, plus
the iollowing:

- Expanded grocery
section

- One-hour photo
shop

- Small snack area

av DAVID DRISCOLL

The coming of the new super Wale
Mart has some downtown businesses
worried about what “always low prices”
mean for their future sales,

Construction began in July for
the Wal-Mart SuperCenter at a site
northwest of the Industrial Avenue
and Highway 146 intersection. The
store is expected to be finished in the
spring Only about
half the size of most
SuperCenters, it will
still double the cur
rent WaleMart's sizc.
Four Lines of groccre
lcs, including a deli,
a bakery, and meats
will be added, as well
as a oneehour photo
shop, a snack area
and wider aislesr

The town of Grinncll has begun ii
reworking of the downtown streets and
sidewalks with the goal of making it a
more attractive area for business, with
an eye towards the future competition
from the superwal-Mart.

The new store will disproportion-
ately impact Grinnell's current grocery
stores, Over the past decade Waleart
grew from only a minor share of the
grocery market to leading it, but Randy
Smith, the manager and owner och-
Nally's, is still conﬁdent about his busie
ness. “They're going to affect us right
away for the initial couple of months,"
he said. “1 think eventually we’re going
to get it all back.”

Smith sees McNally's as a clowns
town convenience store that provides a
different scrvicc. “Our whole focus is to
be different. We carry things they don't
carry,“ he said. McNally’s plans to go

further into organic and natural foods.
“We don't cater to the same kind of
customer that they do." He named col,
lege students, college faculty and senior
citizens from the Mayﬂower as average
customers.

Paul Nouasell, owner of Paul's Ace
Hardware, expressed a similar confi-
dence about his store's ability to with
stand WaleMart’s competition. He is
largely unconcerned
about the new store
and Ace's basic
strategy Will remain
the same. “We try
not to he in direct
competition with
them," he said. “We
try to [find] out
what's not being
sold in the come
munity and fill that
void." VVal-Mart will probably arrect
prices, “They set the standard as far as
price and we have to try to be cornpcrie
tivc with that,”said Nouasell.

Darrell Davis, the
Grinnell WalsMart’s
manager, is puzzled
about the agitation.
“It’s going to be the
same store," he said.
“WalsMarr’s been in
Grinnell for 20 years
and has hopefully
been a good corpo»
rate neighbor that
whole time.”

When the is-
sue of an expanded
WalsMart was raised last fall, the City
Council agreed. Many citizens spoke
out against the new store at spirited
town meetings, but the council voted

in the end to approve the construc»
tion. Byron worley, council-member at
large, said, “It was the most wrenching
decision I've made during six years on
the council,” but “we
don't think it will di-
rectly compete with
local businesses,"

The council
came to the conclu—
sion that the current
Wal-Mart and older
chain stores hrid ale
ready driven simr
lar local stores out
of business and so
the new Will-Mart
would have a limited impact.

Through discussions with VVah
Mart, they confirmed that the Super
Center would not have a tire center,
a photo studio or other departments
common at other SuperCenters that
would directly compete with Grinnell
stores. Even in the grocery business, the
council felt that McNully’s and Fareway
would be relatively
unaffected, leave
ing only Hy—Vee, a
Midwestern chain,
seriously hurt,

The council was
also worried that if
they refused, wal-
Mart would close
the current store,
an ultimatum Wale
Mart often makes
in reluctant coin-
munities. Economic
studies have shown that new local busie
nesses would not open to replace the
WaleMart, but instead locals would
drwe to a nearby town, like Newton,

for a community,”

”[Wal-Mnnsl are ruthless tom-
pelilors. N0 marierhow many

Craig Cooper, owner of Bikes

for its WaleMart. “We're not going to
see the Main Street of 1970," Worley
said. “I don’t think that world is com-
ing back,"

Grinnell is try-
ing to draw people to
the downtown area
to shop at the other
businesses, Smith
believes the downs
town will continue
to thrive and said, “I
think things are just
going to start pope
ping [downtown]
once we can get the
infrastructure in

To You

place."

on rhe other hand, Craig Cooper,
owner of Bikes To You believes it will
have a “devastating" effect, hurting his
cal smaller shops. “They are ruthless
competitors,” he said, and “no matter
how many thousand-dollar checks they
hand out, they are still a net loss for a
community.”

Some Grinnell students agree.
Amanda Baker ‘08 said she is “con-
flicted, because we don't have many rce
sources [in Grinnell]." However, “I feel
a lot ofsmall businesses would suffer. ”

cooper is particularly worried about
the effect that WalsMarr has on prod
uct diversity. “WaleMart is homogeniZe
ing the product mix in everything," he
said, “You don’t have as much choice."

waleMart’s impact on the town's
wellvbeing is a widespread concern.
Nouasell said that though the can,
sumer will benefit in the short term,
“in the long run it’ll continue to hurt
the town... the local economy, the local
(RX base, the state and even the federal
government body."
