Review of the Football Season.

For the ﬁrst time since '95. the
to‘otball season in Iowa has result-
ed in clearly deﬁning a statcrchaim
pionship. iowa University, by a
series of cleanecut victories over
the other teams of the state, has
earned an undisputed right to the
title. Football authorities agree
in raniring Grinnell second and
Antes third. Grinnell proved her
superiority over Ames by defeat-
ing her in two hardrfought games,
while the State University just as
decisively proved her mastery
over‘lowa College.

The season at Grinnell may be
summed up as one ot great op-
portunities partiallyimproved. It
is doubtful if such an atrayof vets
eran material ever reported tor
practice as did this fall. With on-
ly one vacancy in the line, and
two in the back-ﬁeld, we can truth-
fully say that we had every reason
to hope for a winning team, and
in a great measure this hope has
been realized. Our season’s rec-
ordistwo games lost, one tied,
and seven won. We scored 123
points to 38 for our opponents.
Still, it must be acknowledged
that the |eam did not on all ocCa~
sions play the game of which it
was capable. The same Conl-
plaint, ivliich has been applied to
a veteran team as long as such a
thing has been heard oi, is applic-
able to ours ilits year, namely,
that the men relied too much on
themselves individually and laid
too little stress on team work.
The result was disastrously evident
at Iowa City, where the contrast
between eleven men as a tinit and
eleven men as individuals was em»
phasized too strongly to need
comment. Another fault of the
veteran team ivas also in evidence.
namely, occasional slumps in the
work of the men, and a tendency
to take things easy in some of the
smaller games, which otten re
sulted in scores where no scores
should have been made, and came
near leading to a defeat in the
game with Simpson.

The work of the team has been
almost a contradiction of Grinnell
traditions. Grinnell teams as a
rule have been light and fast.
They have usually scored early In
a game it at all, by carrying their
opponents off their feet by the

 

dash and iinpettiosity oi their at-
tack It has also frequeiitiy m:-
ciiried that they have been de-
privrd through laclt' oi ph cal
endurance of victories all but won,
as was the case in the S.U, 1.
game in '97; and iii the game with
Drake in '98.

The team of '99 has conformed
to none of these rules. Instead
of doing its best work in the ﬁrst
half of agame, it has usually made
its strongest showing in the last
halt. Dash and impeiuosity were
not stiilting features of its play;
in tact, the 5. U I, team played a
faster and silappier game at Iowa
Clty than did Grinnell. Tile
team's defense was considerably
strongerthan its offense, some
thing which has raicly, it ever,
happened in the history of foot-
ball at Grinnell. The physical
condition or the men throughout
the season was superb, thanks to
the efﬁcient services of Trainer
Watson. This also is a tlepztrturc
from precedent, but an agreeable
one. Grinnell did iiol play 2t
game this yeal ill which the men
did not ﬁnish in better condition
than their opponents, unless thi:
lllwa City game be it possible exr
ception; and accidents, which
have been an important factor In
the work of other teams, had little

The kicking game, the foundar
tionsut which weielaid by Mr
Blake in on, was probably the
strongest feriture of the team’s
work this year, and played an im
portant part ill the winning of
several vICInI'IeS, The superiority
ofa icam which can kick, over
one which has neglccted that de»
partment of football, is clearly
shown by the Ames game of No
vcnlbel‘3rd, which resulted in a
score of lg to o in favor of Grin
hell, the rcsult being due primari—
Iv to the uttcr inability of the
Allies players to handle punts,
The same lesson is taught by the
Iowa City grime, where the Uilir

er than Grinnell in the klckii-ig
department, and won in conse-

senxult.

 

qucnce of the fact, in this con~
nectlon, mention should be made
oi Wheeler's dropelticking, which
has been a fruitful source ofinuche
needed points, and which was the
direct cause of the tie at Minne-
apolis. ‘

Ciedit should be given to the
members of the alumni who as-
sisted in the coaching during the
season. While the team was un-
fortunatein not havingaconsistent
coaching policy. and showed the
lack of it in some respects, still
the services of the graduate coach-
crs were invaluable and merit recr
ognilion. It is to be hoped, how
ever, that next year may see the
coaching placed upon a more sub-
stantial basis than has been the
case during the season just past.

The Scrubs

A review of the football season
would be incomplete without
mention of the sellrsacriﬁce and
efﬁcient work of the second
eleven. Throughout the season
it has been faithful in its
attendance at practice and to
its stubborn opposition and
strong offensive play can be
traced in a great measure the
strength of the ’varsity.

The life of the scrub is not an
easy one. It is simply the hard
est kind of foot ball without any
glory to make it palatable. In
other years this fact has proved
tletiiincntal to the efﬁciency of
the scrubs,hut this year it can
truthfully be saiil that the second
eleven was the strongest, and

men

 

played in the most consistently
good torm. of ‘any in the history
ot the college.

The scrubs have shown them«
selves to be the stuff of which
toot ball players are made, and
we have good reason to hopefor
the appearance of many ’varsity
men from among their ranks in
seasons yet to come,

The meeting ot the League to
schedule games tor next season
and transact any business of the
League met here Friday.

The application of Simpson
college for membership was con-
sidered and refused by a unanir
mous vote.

The tollowing schedule of

games was arranged with no dini-
culty:

May 5th~Ames vs, Grinnell, at
Allies. -

June gtll—Cornell vs. Grinnell,
at Grinnell.

lune 22d—Cornell vs. Antes, at
COIIIElL

Arrangements wtth Iowa City
were not so easily made, The
representative troin Iowa Ctty
canie dUWn'WILlI two possible
dates, illay 5th and May izth,
upon Which to ptay
games. No one or the other three
schools coutti p‘lay Iowa City on

May mo, and as Antes desiied
to play Grinnell May 5th, and
eoriieii could not play Iowa City
on tllat date, there were no other
available dates for games wtth
Iowa City. Grinnell offered to
play Iowa City on May lg, May
26 or June 2. Iowa City finally
uttered a mild-week date, which
was accepted by Grinnell, but
shortly atterward Iowa City gave
this date to Cornell, demanding
that Grinnell should play May
mill. which Grinnell refused to
do Iowa City then scheduled a
date wtth Antes for june 9th,
“provided he can hold the Iowa
City team together until that‘
date.“

The conduct of the Iowa City
represcnlﬂllve is open to question
why he saved only two dates for
league game , as well as hisre-
lusal to play on any of the dates
offered him.

In view of the relations now ex-
isting between these school. Grin-
nelt does not believe that Mrt
Klinclter's course was dictated by
the school, nor that his course
will be upheld by the school,
