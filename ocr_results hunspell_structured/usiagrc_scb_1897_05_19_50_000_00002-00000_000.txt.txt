We rune pleasure in calling at
tention to the article in another
column on the compilation of a
Grrnneii song boolt, and we wish
the project unqualiﬁed success.
The lew college songs we have
already have become invaluable
to the college. It is hard to real»
ize just how much inﬂuence such

l a Song, insigniﬁcant as it may
seem, may have upon the student

1 body. One prominent s. U. L
man. atter hearing the glee club
sing the college songs, said that
he had discovered where “a good
lot of the ‘Grinncll spirit' came
from.” The inspiration oi such
Songs as he most truly said, acts
as a most decided bond between
the students The college verse
writers have in the past won high
places in the esteem of college
critics and we hope that by songs
from their pens, the second edi.
tion of “The Grinilell Song Boo
may be many fold increased.

THE DUAL Field Meet is re
ferred to in another column but in
addition thereto we would like to
call the attention of the students
to the fact that they have been chr
cidedly remiss in the matter or
organized cheering at the athletic
contests this year. It is true we
have had but one opportunity by
which we could really judge but
the evidence of that one occasion
was very damaging. in former
years there has been something of
an attempt to sustain the spirits
ot our athletes by systematic
cheering and it is time that this
custom was being revived. Sal.»
urday afternoon will be an oppor
tunity to test the merits at the
plan. The Iowa City boys have
been very successful in their train-
