What Gale

Learns From

Illiterates,
Students

Have you ever tried to justify education
to an illiterate person? Probably not, [or
several reasons. First, you may never have
had the privnege of knowing a completely
illiterate person, i.e. one who is bright
and alert and interested but who cannot read
or write his own native language. Secondly,
we in America take education for granted
and the pursuit or knowledge is practically
synonumous with the preamble-’5 pursuit or
happiness. in your lite time education has
never needed to be justified, but is is not
easy. Try it.

In Baghdad our friend and Cook Aziz Could
neither read nor write; as we used to say
he was illiterate in two languages, Arabic
and English. He couldn't even read the
Arabic numbers enough to ride the city
buses. We gave him a photograph ofhim-
sell and he looked at it upside down, More
recently in Addis Ababa Bekela had no
formal education and couldn’t read or write,

and like AZiZ. he attributed most of the
ills ot his country to the students. Educa-
tion made them unhappy and dissatisfied
and uneasy and hence the great preoccur
pation of the Students with demonstrations
and riots. Student protests began in the
Middle East, and the alliance of the StUr
dents and the army to disestablish the es

. tablishment is potential dynamite. So itwas

difficult to justify to Aziz and Bekela the
peaceiul uses oi education; it is like arguing
the peacetui uses of atomic energy.
Education in Baghdad is as old as the hills
from Which gush the oil at the Iraq Petro-
leum Company. it was natural tor prowes-
tern King Faisal to take advantage of the
Fulbright program in 1954755 to strengthen
the work in science and technology, From oil
came education, and from education oi the
Iraqis came oil. But there were byproducts;
not only of the oil but of education! Five at
my students were taken train the classroom
by a squad or soldiers loyal to the King and
shot They were leaders in a “communist-
inspired" coup which a year later was
successtul; King Faisal himself was over-
thrown and shot, and Kassem took over Iraq,

The Scarlet and Black

Education under pro»western, Santlhurste
educated Faisal was not unlike a West Point
education or my day, not yours it was
rigorous, regimented and rcwarding, The
reward in Iraq was a job with the govern»
ment, the country‘s only employer. Iturned
in physics grades by rank in the class
When Kassem took over the government,
one of his first moves was to release all
political prisoners and to ”pass” all stu-
dents who had tailed their baccalaureate
degree examinations, He thus made instant
Iriends of two very powertui but disgruntled
groups. This was my iirst experience with an
erase grading system Education by royal
decl'eeubut royalty was dead, and onicial-
dumh had taken over. Baghdad has been oil
limits to Westerners ever since

In Karachi, education was different.
Pakistan as part of the Indian subcontinent
inherited the British colonial traditioli of
an educated elite. Sllatl, our house manager
and Iriend, had worked {or the British and
learned to read and write a hit, operate a
right hand drive our. check under the bonnet
and change a tyre We visited his village
in the high Himalayas, the happy Hunza
Valley, overlooking Azad (tree) Kashmir.
Shall looked with disdain rather than envy
on the students. They were the snobs from
the 22 ”best" families. The colleges follow
the English lecture system of a prescribed
syllabus and a University-set examination
Attendance at lectures is by whim and I
gave no grades. There were no records to
erase! The student Wrote the examination
set by the University (not by the teacher)
and he merely consults the daily newspaper
to find out it he has “passed", Its a great
system for a lecturer who doesn't like Stu»
dents, as there isn't any personal involve-
ment in what the students does or does not
learn, This system of education produces
an educated elite and makes good clerks,
lawyers, and civil and military servants.
Both Bhutto at Pakistan and Mujil) 0t Bang-
ladesh are the products of such a system
But it doesn't do much for ShaIi’s children
And so I came to Addis Ababa to Hallie
Sellassle I University, Ethiopia has a great
past but it is a long way back, it hasa
great future but it is a long way ahead.
Education there is as new as the present,
and questions are even now being asked,
why have it? The Emperor knows history
because he has lived it and he knows that
the Iraqi students whom Faisal educated
destroyed him. lie (His Excellency) also
knows that to lift Ethiopia from the abyss
of Abyssinla to the head of the African
Nations (OAU) he needs an educated elite
to run the country. And so an educational
System was started by HIM. (His Imperial
Majesty).

The Emperor and his people are a proud
people, and a new University retlects this.
I had no students there, as I do here, with-
out shoes, Shoes are a status symbol and
no student is too poor in spirit to pay the
street boys 10 Ethi cents (4 U.S.)to keep
his shoes sinned He may not have pencil
aild paper but his shirt is spotlessly white
and fresh. I enjoyed greatly my year there
with the students. I put it this way because
the faculty were ferengis (foreigners). Edu-

cation iS so new to Ethiopia that native
teachers had not yet been trained The
students are paid by the government to be
trained for civil and military positions.
The ones in the University learning to be
civilians are eager and anxious to learn,
They would rather be there than in the
army! The pay is not quite so good, but
the [cod and living Conditions are better
than they would have at home it they had
one. The students had learned English in
secondary school and by nature they en-
joyed puns and double meanings oi words
in their own language as well as English
There is a lightness and a bit of humor
in an otherwise dark and serious situation.
But education for what? They wonder too.
Ethiopia has neigher oil nor diamonds, in
tact its unique position of never having been
occupied is because no Mr Rhodes ever

wanted it for what it does not have. All it
has is a beautiful country and beautiful
people The Emperor would like to keep
it that way, but HE is 30 years old! Maybe
on that glorious plateau high above the
Rift Valley where lite is good, maybe igr

norance is bliss! Who is to say? Try to
explain to them what education has to otter.

The Peace Corps tried and failed - a pass
fail system > and our kind of education was
asked to leave the country. Education is now
by transistor radio and the very dispersed
tribes are tuned in and turned on. Education
is for what and when the Emperor joins
the Queen at Sheba!

My student friends among the underground,
guilt by association, see civil war between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, between the Muslems
and Coptics, between the Callas and Am-
haras, between the haves and have riots,

what evaluation system tor our own educa—
tion in this country? Education for what'.7
We hear much this election year about the
quality or lite, the good life. The Dupont
slogan 0! “Better things i_or Better Living
Through ChemistryH has lost some at its
appeal, even though the Duponts still live
better than the Joneses, Do we need agoocl.
better, best evaluation:7 Some think so; a
leading Iowa department store now adverr
tises “The best of everything.” Do we need
the best? Do we need everything? lam learn-
ing from present Grinneii students that the
answer is an emphatic NO.

From my Baghdad students and experience
I learned that even when things are bad they
can get worse. Protests, yes, but violence
and vandalism, riots and rebellion lead to
destruction and death. The fertility of that
fertile crescent has changed to futility and
education has gone from bad to worse andis

now erased.

From my Karachi Students I learned that
education tor a few is not enough where the
density of population is the highest in the
world. The system may work on the playing
fields of Eaton but in the rice fields of
Bangladesh they don't play war games and
the tactics are different, The sun is setting
on parts of the Empire and Southeast Asia
has the most beautiful sun sets in the world.

From my Ethiopian students I learned once
again that learning does not need a profit
motive and can be just plain fun, That may
be its best justification. It is an easy and
natural transition lrom fun to funny to humor
to human to humans and maybe education’s
role is to humanize the world, a world where
no one is better or worse than someone
else, Thanks to my students, they are great
teachers,
