Ltke the Milder,
Better Taste
of Chesterﬁelds

UST trying a package or two will

show you that Chesterﬁelds are
Milder and Better-Tasting. But
you can’t learn much about why
they’re that way. . . except by tak-
ing our word for it.

Wherever cigarette tobaccos are
on sale, there you will ﬁnd our
buyers, busy picking out and pur-
chasing ripe, mild lobaccos—al-
most good enough to eat.

Then they are blended and cross-
biended—Domestic and Turkish
both—in just the right propor-
tion . . . so that there’ll be just one
good ﬂavor and aroma.
