commodated in the quadrangle
dining room this year, Miss Niel»
lie Gleason, director of foods, an-
nounced Wednesday.

The action has been taken be-
cause of crowded conditions in
the dining hall itself, she added,
and not because of any food
shortage.

“Former students, parents, and
other guests certainly will un-
derstand that this move is one
for expediency only," Miss Clea-
son stated.

Heads for four other commie
tees were chosen at the Tuesday
