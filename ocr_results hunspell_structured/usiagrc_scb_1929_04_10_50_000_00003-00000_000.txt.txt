four of the faculty residents ot the
Quadrangle who were discovered in
the process of picnicing
what one does up the tracks) several
hundred ties beyond the Quad one
night last week. They were detected
by the strong odor of toasted marsh-
mallows which was greatly in corn
trost with the usual aroma in that vi.

what defunct Student Council may be
called to handle this situation. It is

dent property by faculty members will,

Arrangements may be made with
Chuck Parish for private swimming
exhibitions at Arbor Lake any warm
evening this month.

It was such a NICE picnic that
Chuck and Vivian went on that they
didn't eyeduse the blankets enough
to keep from losing them. Anyone
who knows where the same may be
located notify c. \Voody.
