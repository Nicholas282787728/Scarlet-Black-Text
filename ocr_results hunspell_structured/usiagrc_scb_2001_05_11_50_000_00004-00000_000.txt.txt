Well, it looks like
the end of hell week. I
can tell because my
immune system has
completely shut down.
Due to stress, lack of
sleep, and the
missing/assumed dead
status of my
multivitamins, I am nu
less susceptible to
opportunistic disease
than the boy in the
bubble out of the
bubble.

It happens every
semester. Unhealthy
living and a liberal arts
education puts out the
welcome mat to every
ailment, bacteria and
disease out there and I
never see it coming
because I’m too busy
trying not to tail.

And even if I just
catch a little cold, I
can't remedy it with
rest and quilts and soup
and Family Feud reruns
because I have eight
million things to do,
and most of those eight
million things have
page requirements. So
instead of my cold
being treated, it is
prodded and provoked
with meals or dingc
dongs, sleepless nights
and essay tests. Soon,
the cold has evolved
into a variety of
infections, sores, and
tongestions.

Before I know it,
within the week, that
little cold has turned
into a sinus infection,
cold sores, bronchitis,
strep throat and the
ﬂu. Too bad I took my
last Dayquil and
decongestant to stay up
all night writing a lab
last week. And too bad
I don't have space in
my schedule to Visit the
health center. So I
wander around for a
week or two, feverish
and confused. All I can
do is hope that I intect
a protessor or two by
coughing on the nnal
draft.

But at least we’ll be
done. We can look back
on ﬁnaLs week and
congratulate ourselves
on a ajob well done
and pat ourselves on
the back. But not too
hard, of course, you
might agitate your
hives.

For now, though.
focus on summer.
Summer will be great.
We can move on to
more pleasant
unpleasantries like
sunburns, mosquito
bites, eyestrain from
reading trashy novels 7
even hedsares if we are
lucky. tan you imagine
being in your bed long
enough to get sores?

Need to look even better?

Summer‘s coming, and with it begins the season ol’ swimsuits,

added, “Arrer buying cigarerres and alcohol,

“Music?"Jcnni askccl. “I don't know what you’re ralking about "

That's because Rachel and Jenni are srrong believers in dislrlljur

you should really ask Rachel." “Well, I irrrr rhink music is an rm.

and I haven't found a husband yet! instead, I choose ro bask in rhc
