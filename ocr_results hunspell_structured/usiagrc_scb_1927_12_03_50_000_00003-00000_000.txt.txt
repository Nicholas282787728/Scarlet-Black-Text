Editor,
. The Scarlet and mach,

Dear Sir: There is undollhtedly
much variance oi opinion regarding
the editorial attitude which the
SCARLET AND BLACK should take
on any topic or current discussion.« it
would seem, however, that ii inu—
fledged newspaper practice is to be
adopted, the editorial columns should
be used solely tor the presentation oi a
well-formed editorial policy, and that

' such edimrial policy should be consist—
ently- thrilled with the best interests oi
the college community at heart.‘

it is the pride or this publication,
and it should be, that it is iree trons
censorship and permits untrammeled
expression or student thought. But if
the SCARLET AND BLACK wishes to
become more than a mere iorum or
opinion, it it wishes to hecoine an ac—
tive and constructive force working
for the best interests or the college.
then it may hehoove editorial writers
to give serious thought to the matter
or an editorial policy that displays not
only independence, but also restraint
and dignity. Freedom and fearless
ness in the expression oi editorial
opinion are above all things to be de»
siredilF due thought has ﬁrst been
given to making that opinion consist—
ent with an editorial policy which is
constructive and worth while. Freer
dam merely for the sake oi ireedoin is
little to he desired.

Take, tor instance, this matter of
Grinnell traditions. Few topics have
come in for more sly digs from the
editorial pen (or punches oi the edi-
torial typewriter) than this one. Yet
the fact of the matter is that traditions
have given to Grinnell the distintcive
position which it now occupies, a posi-
tion which ﬁlls with inward pride even
those students who smile with su-

, periority at the very mention of a mere
“tradition," Traditions give Grihnell
a background that is individual, and a
ioundation that is secure against every
gust of wayward iancy in education,

Vevel-y huitet ot deﬁance against its
deenvlaid ideals and principles The
spirit of pioneers is a crinnell “tradir
tion"; the principle of student govern-
ment is a Grinnell “tradition“; the

, spirit of truth is a Griuuell "tradi-

tion." The cry to “Challenge the

world” is a Grinuell tradition. Yes,
even this freedom from censorship
which we ﬂaunt. so deﬁantly to the
four windhithdt, also, is a. Grinneil
"tradition.” .

Perhaps it is too much to ask that

Ayouth appreciate tradition, Perhaps
this scorn of tradition is a part of the
necessary education or the college stu-
dent. Perha s it is too much to ask
that the edit rlal columns of a student‘
publication he used to express not
more random opinion, hut also well—
fornpulated ideals or permanent and
recognized value to the institution
which they represent. But certainly
it is not too much mask that if Grin—
nell students neither respect nor ap-
preciate the real sighniﬁcance oi Grin-
nell tl'aditionsiwho will?

GENERAL lElLlECTR

ELECTRIC

THE great Persian ruler gazed from a hill-1
top upon his vast army of a million men.
It was the largest army that had ever existed.
And he turned away with tears in his eyes
because in a hundred years all trace of it
would be gone. That army was a symbol of'
power, destructive and transient.

Today in one machine, now being built in the
General Electric shops, there is combined
the muscular energy of two million men.- This
great machine, a 'steam turbine, is also a
symbol of power—a new power that is con-
structive and permanent.

Its unprecedented size, a record in construc-
tion of Such machines, is a pledge to the people
that the electrical industry is on the march,
ever on the alert to supply plenty of electricity
at a low cost to all.
