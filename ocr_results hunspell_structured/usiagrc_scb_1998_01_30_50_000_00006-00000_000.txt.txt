past, it will be a great battle between
Luther and Grinnell."

' Havtng won both the Gleysteeri Relays and the Grinnell Invitational at home, th
women 's swim team has proven it has a great advantage competing infriendly
conﬁnes of Obermiller Pool.

Carmen Steward and Kiersten Wolf
and sophomore Lisa Haberl also had
multiple first place ﬁnishes. Divers
Jo Schaalman ’99 and Welch ﬁnished
first and second: respectivly, in the
one-meterevent and second and third
in the three-meter event.

The outcome of the Grinnell In-
vitational bodes well for the Pio-

neers' chances at conference title
because both meets follow the same
two day format with preliminary
races each morning and finals each
night. Coach Hurley, however, hopes
to learn rather than become overcoo-
fident from the victory.

“Our goal was to be focused eve
ery session and we weren't., In the

morning session on Sunday we did
not swim well. What was redeem-
ing was coming back Sunday night
and swimming absolutely outstandr
ingly," explained coach I-Iurley, “If
we can swim our best and compete
the entire meet, we have a good
chance tommorow and at confer
ence.”

Sports Infomiation

After two close losses last week,
the Grinnell College men’s baskete
ball team hopes to turn the
tables on Saturday as they
travel to Illinois College for
a league game.

“If last week was an im—
portant week for us, then this
week is even more impor»
tant," explained Coach
David Arseneault. “We have
to be a better basketball team
at home.”

Despite having a 6~8 overall
record and a 1—4 mark in the league,
the Pioneers could gain some mo-
mentum in league standings this
week Illinots College stands at 0-
6 in the conference.

“I expect our games to be very,
very competitive this
week," noted Arsencault.

Last week the Pioneers
hosted three home games,
but their chance to make
a move went to no avail.
Grinnell beat Iowa
Wesleyan, 1237112, on
Wednesday. However, in
the most important game
of the week, the cagers
fell to league foe
Monmouth, 107405, on
