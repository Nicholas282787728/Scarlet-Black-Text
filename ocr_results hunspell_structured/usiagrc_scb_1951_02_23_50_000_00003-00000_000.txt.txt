Commager’s Talks Explore American Character

By Andy Billingsley

This yeal ’s Rosenflcld lectures, deliveled by H'

“(15 profess

sor Henry Steele Commager, have been concerned with “The Am-
erican Character in its World Setting”

Speaking at an allecullege convocation in Darby gym on Mon.
day morning, Mr. Commager opened his series of five lectures with
a discussion of “American Contributions to Political Institutions in

the Western World."

Pointing out that Americans
have made no more successful
or lasting contribution to civili-
zation than that made in the
realm or politics, he decried the
fact that Americans generally
are "ashamed of politics."

Mr. Commager repeatedly re
ferred to English heritage and
development in the realm of
politics and our indebtedness to
it.

According to the speaker,
the English and the Americans
have been on the whole in-
dilrerent to political philoso-
phies yet “the two most sucl
ccssful people in political prac-
line.”

Mr. Commager credited our
advancement in politics to the
political party which is an Am-
erican invention. “The constitu-
tion itself is more expendable
than political parties", he said.

.

Turning to “American Contri—
butions to Religion” on Tuesday
night, Mr. Commager addressed
a near capacity nudlence in Here

state was first practiced in the
United States according to the
speaker,

That is not true in the United

States, however. Many oi the

reiorm movements in this

country have had the active
support or the church, the

speaker said. i

”Our goal," he said, should be

the creation of a world where
“free nations and free people
can make tree choices.” The
Commonwealth teaches that
this can be done by agreement
on “baSlc moral values. We must
not think we can impose our
program on other nations Just
because we are powcrrul and
