Yesterday, the Senate apt
proved an emergency spending ,
bill for the war in Iraq.The bill in-
chlded a controversial measure: set
ting March 31, 2008 as the Withdrawal
date of all US. forces in Iraq. The withdrawal date is nous
binding, making the bill significantly different than a similar
version passed by the House earlier this weekThe withdraw-
al date, though nonbinding, is the first formal statement by
both houses on the war. President Bush is expected to veto
the bill which, because the bill was barely passed with the 50‘
vote minimum, will probably not be overridden.

Supporters of the bill trumpeted it as a first step toward
establishing a real plan for withdrawal from the beleaguered
country. Senate Majoirty Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat
from Nevada and strong critic of the war, agreed that the war
in Iraq was important for national security and humanitaris
anism, but that the way it is currently being fought is wasteful
and ineffective. According to Reid, a U.S. victory is vital but,
“.. .to win that war, we must choose a new path in Iraq.“

Republican critics of the measure attacked the bill for its
potentially demoralizing effects on troops overseas. “What
are our commanders in the field supposed to think," asked
John Thune Republican Senator from South Dakota. Fols
lowing the approval of the bill, the National Republican
Congressional Committee distributed a press release calling
the bill politically manipulative. A yes vote on the bill by a
congressional representative, it said, "[ptovcs his/her] will-
ingness to put the political interests of the House Dcmoc
leadership over the needs of the troops in the ﬁeld... Ar
zona Senator and Presidential candidate John McCain said
that imposing a definitive timetable would guarantee a U. .
failure in Iraq and that the “bill should be named the Date
Certain for Surrender Act."

:1 would have to agree
with the bill I dont think
we should be in Iraq any way
and I think that they should
get the troops out of there.
We’ve been over there for a
really long time and nothing
seems to change and it seems
kind of wasteﬁil."

.“I ﬁnd it ironic that so
many people are for the war,
but against the way it’s be»
ing carried out. I really don't
think it’s going to do any-
thing. I think we need to
stop [the war]. If we all can’t
agree on what the problem
is, then we shouldn’t be there
at all. ”

K:DIC Producing only static?

After cancelling last semester, this semester campus radio is still unreliable

BY ALEX CoNLoN

At the start or this year, with the new campus center line
ished, many students had hopes that KDIC could resound
throughout the building. Mike Kobet ’09 pioposcd a student
initiative that Kch be played in the new dining hall in lieu
otthc familiar musical selections that looped several times per
meal in Cowles last year, instead, chic was never able to get
on air last semester and has continued experiencing serious dif-
ficulties this spring.

Last semester, due a variety or technical problems from
construction, KDIC was not operational until afterThanksgiv—
ing break. Because it was so late in the semester, the station
decided to wait until spring semester to go on air, according
to station manager Daniel Furuta ’08. KDIC was then brieﬂy
on air from the beginning of this semester until the week he
tore spring break but has been unavailable since then. During
this blackout, Furuta said KDIC still was available on campus
through webcast until last week when the server computer went
down.

Both Furuta and Michael Sims, Associate Dean for Stun
dent Life and the administrator overseeing ICDIC, attribute
the problems KDIC has endured to difficulties with the sta-
tion transmitter that only a qualiﬁed licensed engineer can fix,

Sims said for at least the last ten ycars KDIC and Grinnell's
local station KGRN have relied an engineer lim Davies, who
works full time at the University orowa station and part-time
at several other stations. Furirta noted that Sims and Davies are
the only people with access to the transmitter and Sims said he .
has no personal background in radio or engineering.

Both Sims and Furuta said Davies is the only engineer in
the area qualiﬁed to fix the transmitter and he is often occupied
by his other jobs and unable to comC to Grinnell. “He has many
other obligations,wc'a‘e not at the top ofhis list,”said Fnruta.

But while Sims and Furuta explain KDIC’s problems Sim»
ply as the result of an over-extended engineer, others on the
KDiC staff have alluded to greater problems. Program director,
Mike Rogowski, described the 1(ch outage as symptomatic of
“KDIC’ s diminished role on campus "“It really seems like the
administration' JIISK doesnt care about Kch and we re treated
like the black sheep oftlie campus, he said' In an email

Assistant music director, Eric Rohn, echoed Rogowski’s
sentiments. “My real concern is just that our engineer doesn’t
care much (and is located an hour away)" he said in email, “and
that it seems that 1(ch is regarded by the engineer, admin—
istration, and students as something that doesn‘t have a lot of
credibility...”

students without having an outside
party prompt them. Jaime Franklc ’08,
another Clangrala staff member, noted
that in emergency circumstances, faculty should be particularly '
attentive to the fact that not all students are able to take the
initiative to discuss workload “[Students] should feel able to
take care of themselves before they worry about their work,”shc
said. “They should be able to be a part otthe community and go
to the vigil and talk to their friends and do whatever they need
to do to be oleay.”

While Student Affairs continues to make suggestions
to professors and offer students academic advising, Stern said
there are limits to what the administration is capable of. “Just
like students have selfsgovernance in the residence halls," Stern
said ”faculty have their own self-governance both in the terms
of the policy structure on the academic side and in terms of
what they can do within their individual courses."

Frankle and Benness said that student action in these
types of emergency situation concerns is not unprecedented.
After three student suicides in 2003, students were involved in
the decision to make finals optional Furthermore, according
to Stern, they were instrumental' in establishing walk in mun,
seling at the Health Center. In the end, though, Frankle said,
“Wejust want strident input beforc it reaches that level, and so
it won't reach that level."
