In a week, a new piece of color will be added to cam—
pus to carry on the memory of Gi'innell sludent Whitney
Hendrickson ’12. who passed away during spling break of
her ﬁts! year.

On Saturday, Oct. 17, a Red Maple tree will be planted
in the southwest section of central campus in memory of
Whitney Hendricksou '12, along with a plaque coinineinoe
rating her time at Grinnell.

“She loved Grinnell, It was just perfect fit foi her. She
really blossomed at Griunell and discovered all sorts of
interests and was really starting to launch or? into adulte
hood." said Whitney's mothei, Clelia DeMoraes.

Whitney died on March 17,2009 in her hometown of
Colorado springs, Colorado, when a pickup truck collided
with the gas pump she was using to ﬁll up her minivan.

soon after a memorial was held foi Whitney on April 3
in Herrick Chapel, the idea for the memorial came during
discussions between Dean of Religious Life Deanna Shorb
and Whitney's close friends.

“We liked the idea of a tree because Whitney loved
trees, she loved climbing in trees," DeMoraes said. “I think
she had even climbed several of the trees on the Grinnell
campus, so it just seemed very fitting for her.”

The Red Maple tree will stand out in central campus,
with its vibrant colors colors in the fall, contrasted against
the other trees.

“It’s the perfect dedication to Whitney that we give her
such a beautiful and outstanding tree. She just loved nature,
in that vein 1 think she would love this,” said Brad Gordon
'12, Whitney’s boyfriend during her time at Grinnell, “Eve
eryone unanimously agreed."

President of the college Russell K. Osgood was key
in moving the dedication along. “I didn’t want this to end
from the perspective of [Whitney’s family] and Grinnell
without something that would he an enduring sign of her
here," Osgood said.

Along with the dedication of the tree and a plaque, a
brunch will be held shortly after the initial service. VVhit—
neys family will be in attendance for the event and has
asked anyone who would like to visit or meet them to come
to Grinnell House for coffee and juice.

“Vl/hilney has such spectacular friends and our house
was filled with her fiiends both before she died and after

she died, DeMoraes said. We re really looking forward
to seeing her friends againiwe did coinc out for the me
Inorial sei-viee last spring and we havent been back since

Osgood said he hopes that the early scheduling Sate
urdny morning will allow students to attend the service
before heading home for fall break

“I know people need to leave and everything, Iiut I
hope people can bc there and that‘s why we put it early
on Saturday," Osgood siid,

Along with the memottal on Grinnelrs campus, a
garden and statue have been planned for the Miramont
Castle museum in Colorado, where Whitney spent her
summers working.

“Some of the students at Palmer High School and
some of her former teachers at Palmer High School and
the executive director of Miramont Castle got together
and decided it'd be a wonderful idea to create a garden in
her memory,” DeMoraes said.

In addition to the garden, a local sculptor offered to
donate a sculpture ofVVhltney to be placed in the garden.

“Next summer we're planning to have an opening tee
ception and invite Whitney’s fiiends to coinc see the gare
den in bloom and the new statue," DeMoraes said,

The Hendrickson and DeMoraes family asked that
any donations be sent to the Care N’ Share food bank of
Colorado springs, a charity that Whitney was involved
with.

“We really want to thank everyone at Griilnell who’s
been so kind and considerate towards us and helping us
to preserve Whitney’s memory," DeMoraes said. “She
loved Grinnell. It was just a perfect fit for her. She really
blossomed at Grinnell and discovered all sorts of inter-
ests and was really starting to launch offinto adulthood,"

The tree will stand as a testament to Whitney's effect
on her friends and classmates long after current students
have left this campus for new homes,

“I hope that everyone will see this not as necessarily
closure, not like, ‘Let’s put an end to this,’ hut something
that will always be there. \Vhenever we come back, we
can always pay our respects to Whitney," Gordon said.
“She loved this place so much.”

Student impact on College Hearing Board

BYJUMI BELLO

College Hearing Board is known to be where the most
severe cases of violations of college polities go for appro—
priate ruling. Before last year, Cole
lege Hearing Board had no studente
selected peer representation to take
part in the decision making process-
es.

During the summer, SGA decide
ed to take initiatives to put commus
nally selected students on the board.
I-Iarry Krejsa '10, SGA President,
and Joanna Demars ’10, SGA Vice
President of Academic Adivising,
who wrote the initiatives, decided to
take the Iefoim ofthe boards a few steps further: make their
records of cases public and reveal the identities of student
jurors.

“What is one of the biggest goals of this year's adinine
lSEl'iltlon is to enhance students' stake in all parts of the

college," Krejsa said. “That’s especially important in these
Hearing Boards because we're dealing with people who have
violated the standards of our self governing community and
an inherently per»
soiial and impor»
tant part of how
we perceive our
selves as a com—
munity is how we
treat others who
have violated its"

The first part
of the reforms
aims to give stu—
dents the opportunity to apply to
both Hearing Board and Judicial Council as one body of
applicants, which SGA interviews and selects from, making
their presence on Hearing Board more institutionally sup
ported. Also, SGA will train till: new jurors in an orientation
heroic classes start in August.

Not only will the students have a more legitimate pres-
ence on the board, their identities will be made public from
now on,even though who is deciding any given case will still
be kept conﬁdential.

The availability of records of the
cases put before Hearing Board will
also come into public knowledge. In
order to protect the individuals in-
volved in the cases, SGA will redact
any identifying information within the
records when they are released.

The records will be released at
the end of the semester in order to foil
any attempt to chronologically orga-
nize the cases and find out the students involved. “I think
that’s a really important piece ofsclfgover nce that needs
to be celebiated and utilized,"DcIiiars said .]It's import
taut that students realize this is a really good thing that's
happening on campus and hopefully better things will come
