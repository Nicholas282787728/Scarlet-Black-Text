siness has long been inadequated and
antiquated. At the Thursday evening
meeting the committee Consisting of
Dr. D. P. Breed, Prof. Charles Noblei
Hon. 1. P. Lyman, Rev. J. T. Ma 'ln
and Prof. L, F, Parker, will report on
articles of incorporation. It is to he
hoped‘that some progressive action
will be taken in the matter of putting
things on a more business like Diane.

strongly the past tivosiindays ot the
imperative need of such action.
