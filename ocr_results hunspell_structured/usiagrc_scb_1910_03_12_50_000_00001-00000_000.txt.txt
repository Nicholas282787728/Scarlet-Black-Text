Stl'mlp Temp to llcpri-srlli Gl‘l'nlll‘ll in
Big Indoor .llt’zl at
Uilmlia.

Manager Fisher has recently issued
an invitation to all the colleges and
universities of the state, to take part in
a track meet to be held in Grinnell on
May 21. The management has had
the holding of such an event in mind
for some time, but it was only last
week that a method or financing it was
found and now it is very probable that
the Commercial Club, composed ofvtlie
merchants of the ci ‘, will have com-
plete charge oi‘ the meet. ~

The idea is to hold tiie meet under
the rules governing the old Iowa con»
ierence, thus giving the smaller col-
leges oi the state a better opportunity
to show their strength. Griiinell will
have the sen s oi several star men
in this uieet, who wil. not he allowed
to compete in the iiissouri Valley Meet
at Des hloines two weeks later.

It is not at all certain, liowcve'
that several or the larger schools, in-
clnding Allies, Drake and Iowa, will
compete, because of the fact that the
Ni ourl Valley meet copies on the lol-
lowing Saturday.

in case the meet is at all successful
this spr lg. plans will be laid on root
to incite the event a permanent one.

it has been dccidcd to send is team
to the big indoor meet at ouraha on
April 2. All the big schools, athletic
associations and v. M, C. as oi the
central west will be represented, and
competition will certainly be lteen in
every event,

Trainer Fisher has had about twelllY-
ﬁve men going thin the paces in the
"gym” during the past week, and it
the weather remains warm, the sspin
ants ior the team will probably train
out or doors next week.

T.hat.Grlnnell will be rvell,roprosenc
ed in thc sprints, is a foregone concili-
sion. Turncr and Gill arc undouhtedly
the two fastest men in Iowa, and ought
to be able to give a good account or
themselves in the 50-yard dash at
Omaha. Ernest, Acad, and Beers, 'll,
are both showing rip well and one or
them will probably take the trip.

Last years mile relay team rrrll be
taken along, with the exception or
Flannsgnu, and his place will be ﬁlled
by Captain Turner. Erich man will
run about 400 yards. The team will
make a big oiiort to defeat the Dralrc
quartctte, which took Grinnell’s meas
ure twice last ycar in this event.

Knowles, Wells and Clark will be to-
lrcn along and should contribute sev-
eral points to Griniiell's total. In case
any distance men are on the team.
Dawhins and Boyack will be taltcn.
The meet will not be held under any
particular rules, so any man 'in the
school is eligible.

A talk of unusual interest was given
in chapel yesterday by Professor
Stoops, on the subject 0! our double
self. We possess. according to Protes

rational self, the other an emctmnal
self. Only the latter exlsm in the lower

Class Carnival Contribute to

Every one Found out what “K. K."
meant who attended the Athletic ASso-
cialion‘s Carnival last night at the
Men's uyniuaslum. While the crowd
was rather small and the genuine car»
nival sp which was noticeable on
a similar occasion last year, was ab-
sent, the features themselves were well
arranged.

The usual carnival leatlires were
present, including a shooting gallery,
Nigger Bables. vaudeville show and
Chute the Chutes, Besides these, there
was a fortune teller, a clever represen-
tation of Sher-man's Synonym ior war,
and an attraction entitled Bum c. A.
Fraudville. A magician, Jack Smith,
the shooting expert, and "Skin” Mllr
ler, alias Professor Norman in hyp-
notic stunts, all contributed to the run.

The inevitable booths, selling pop.
corn, inercream cones, iiexible cigar-
ettes, and other carnival mvorltes were
on hand. At the election of queen of
the carnival, Miss Eleanor Clarli won
out, having received the largest num-
ber of votes at one cent each.

The nflalr was excellently managed
by Murray McMurray, ’10, hsslsted by
Robert Lindsay, ‘10, Morton Clark, '10,
and Everett Wells, '12.

The banquets 01 the New York and
Boston Grlnnell Alumn' Assoclntlona
will be held on March 28 and 30 respec-
tively. Presldeut Maln will attend
both meetings.

The new college catalogue which will

The degree oi Bachelor oi Philosophy

Another important change is the
requiremontol only one niztjor sub-

sixteerhlloilr minor. What is now
Itiiolln as a Minor course will be called
