Chciig wii, is now mayor of Chun-
king, the wartime capital of
China, according to Mrs, Samuel
J. Pooley. mother of John w.

“He was one of the smartest
men in Gl'inllcll, a very brilliant
student," Mrs, Poolcy recalled

Early last fall Mr. Wu almost
“lost face". as the Chinese put
it, because of a bombing disaster
in the city of Cliunlring during
which 750 people suffocated in an
ai aid shelter. le‘. Wu was rcprr
mended by offlclzlls for negli—
gence. but retained his position as
mayor. He is welHiked‘by Gen—
eral Chlallg—Kai-Shek, Mrs. Poolcy
said.

, Mrs. Pooley remembered him as
a short fellow, jolly and full-low
ing. “He used to tutor me in an
old Chinese gambling game. Man
Jongh, in his spare time,” she
related, “It was a very complicat-
ed game, being very popular in
the twenties. He said people used
to sit up all night on New Year’s
Eve in China, playing the game."

Mr. Wu entered Grinnell in
1919, and graduated in 1923 with
high honors as a student of po-
litical seienee. He gave his ad-
dress at that time as Peking, /
China, according to files in the
registrar's office.
