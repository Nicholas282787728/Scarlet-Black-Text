capital Commentary

Cont. from p. I

NATO and the _UN were as»
sailed a: “ridiculous internation—
alism” at the time they were
formed.

Now why has all this come
about? The truth of the mat-
ter is that like it or not, the
American people have come to
regard such policies as fund:—
mentally sound, and until 1952
the Republicans refused to
realize this and were out of
step.

But that year they chose as
their nominee 3 popular military
leader who had sense enough
to realize that we actually had
gone forward in the past 20
years and that a continuation
of such policies would not be
disastrous. True, he had a
rough time with elements of
his own party who couldn’t see
this, enough to the extent that
he even wanted to form a party
of his own; but nevertheless he
has appeared to have settled
his differences with the GOP
old guard.

50 Mr. Eisenhower has suc—
ceeded in capturing the lead-
ership or the nation for eight
years, but it is interesting to
note that the same nation has
entrusted his party to making
the laws of the land only
twice since 1928,

Democrats may be proud, for

Valthough the Republicans may

have won the Presidency, the
Democrats won the Republicans
first. They may be proud of
Adlai Stevenson and the cam—
paigns he conducted, for it is
difficult indeed to campaign
against one who has adopted
90% of your party’s principles
and is a military hero to boot.

They may be proud that
political registration in this

head waiter are Kay Jurgensenl country is still predominantly

and Jerry Cooke.

Democratic and that whatever
popularity the Republicans
have is due to a personality
who achieved his first niche
in history through the confi—
dence of two Democratic prose
idents.

And best of all they can look
forward to the greatest GOP
convention in history in 1960
when the Nixons, the Deweys.
the Lodges, the Adainses and
all the rest will ,fight it out for
the nomination. For the issue
then will be whether the‘ “Party
of the Future” really has one.
