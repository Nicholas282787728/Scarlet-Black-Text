The women’s volleyball team hosted the Grinnell College In—
vitational on September 2 and 3‘ The Pioneers went ()4 in the
tournament, taking last place behind the Champions Buena Vista
and visiting teams Ashford, Martin Luther and Clarke, Howevera
the final results did not accurately reﬂect the competitiveness of the
games.

“I’m not at all disappointed in our performance at the tolli'nar
ment,"said Coach Tom Soniiiehsen.

The Pioneers had to overcome a number ofobstaeles to reach a
competitive level ofplav.“We had a little rarigiic set in,wllii:h made
it hard said Sonnichsen Atournamentisatoughundcrtaking be
cause its physically so hard and our team has had several injuries
and oirly has twelve members. That s not a lot of depth so our start—
ers have to play a lot

The starting players on the volleyball team provided a solid, den
pendable foundation for the Pioneers this past weekend. “For EXT
ample, one of our niiddles contracted a head cold the night befoie
the tournament and she was still expected to go out and give it one
hundred peieenr," said Sonniehsen.

Despite these setbacks, the team pulled together to play very
well and created many scoring opportunities during the matches.
They also demonstrated a good measure of ability for this early in
the season.

A winding coirntry path, softened
by days orrain, set the stage as Grinnell
athletes tore through the countryside
last weekend The Grinnell mens and
women‘s cross country teams raced to
impressive second and third place rinr
ishes on a picturesque farm in Laws
rence, Kan, during the Bob Timmons
Invitational on Saturday The beauti-
ful course, which followed rolling hills,
curved around lakes and went through
coveted bridges, was completely ig-
noted as the runners blew past.

The meet was hosted by the Unit
versity of Kansas, a Division 1 school.
Although the scenery was pleasant, the
84rdegree weather and high humid
ity made the Invitational a challenging
way to begin the season.

Due to the hills and shaky foot-
ing, particularly during what Coach
Will Freeman teimed a “horrendous"
fourth mile, the Bob Timinons invite is

players of the tournament as chosen by a vote by the coaches ofall
participating teams The Grinntll College Invitationals All Tour:
nament team was made up of twelve players from all ﬁve teams,
including Collins and I-lodgman, who are both team captains and
have been starters for three years.

“I am honored to have been selected to the Alerollrnament
team,"said Collins,“1 felt that we played hard this weekend and it is
a shame that our tournament recoid does not show that. i think that
the tournament was a good experience for us to see whatwe need to
work on so that we can be more successful in the future."

Grinnell's next tournament will be this Saturday at Eureka Colt
lege. Sonnichsen has good expectations for this tournament as well
as the rest ofthe season.

“I think as we begin to Improve our passing, on- orrcnse will
become more effrcientf said Sonnieliscn. Our defense is strong, oui
blocking is good I think the outlook looks pretty good."

The members of the volleyball team are also conﬁdent about the
rest of the season The injuries are large problem for the team, but
they are temporary:

“The tournament let us know what we need to work on, but
more importantly that ive show lots of promise. 1 am very contidcnt
that we will have a good season, especially once all ofour players are
healthy,“ said Hodginan. “As it is, many signiﬁcant players are hurt
with various ailments, so I think that once we have time to adjust to
new players and get healthy, we will be a very good team."

pleased with the team‘s performance in

The teams had mixed feelings about
beginning the season in Kansas. “It's
nice to start the season on a hard course
because no matter what we'll probably
all improve our times," said Katie Ryan
'07.

Justin Riley '06 had a different
opinion. “I'll tell you what’s the matter
with Kansas—the hills and the heat,”
he said. “Whoever said that Kansas is
ﬂat needs to reconsider"

The men's team trailed the DI Kant

The Grinnell men’s soccer team got
an early start on the '05 scrison with
three non-conference games this past
week,

The Pioneers were defeated by cen-
tral College on Sept, 1 and swallowed
an especially tough, doublerovertime
loss against Carleton College at. home
on Septs. Both games were dccidcd by
only one goal,

The teams main focus during the
two games was to get into shape for the
upcoming Conference season. Although
all ofthe soccer team trains during the
slimmer, some of the athletes believe
that playing real games is the best way
to prepare for a season.

“You can’t get into shape until you
get into the game," said co-captain
Gideon Erkenswiek '06. All three co»
captains, Lucas Hollister loo, Kip Keir
ley '05 and Erkcnswick, felt very good

 

Knuth were close behind in 13th and
19th place with times of 28:08 and
27:36. Henry Reich '06 rounded out
the team's fifth spot, placing 22nd over-
all with a time of28116 minutes.

Freeman noted that after the third
mile the team’s top five runners were
separated by only 17 seconds. He was
also “encouraged that the end gap be
tween the first and fifth runners was
only 1:19," and he emphasized that in
coming weeks the team would focus on
closing that gap.

ThisyeartheGrinnellwomen made
their first appearance at Bob Tim—
mons. The women's course is unusual
because it is S-k instead of the normal
oak, Nonetheless, it is still an especially
difficult course and the women faced
completely new competition.

The lady Pioneers trailed the Kant
sas Juyhawks (56 points) and Butler
County (72 points) with 91 points for
a third place debut among 10 teams, in

what was a much closer race than the
men's.

Sarah Spencer ’08 led the women’s
team with a 6th place time of 19:11.
Ryan and Meredith Groves ’08 placed
15th and 19th with times of20:04 and
20:36 respectively. Juniors Erin Sinder
Wald and Erin Booth placed 2am and
29th with times of20:59 and 21:12 to
fill out the team's top five.

“The women are really excited
about their prospects for the season,"
said Groves. She felt that the Bob
Timmons Invitational gave the women
“a good feel for where the team is."

Coach Evelyn Freeman noted that
the results reﬂected the strength of the
team's sophomores and juniors and
that their competitiveness with schools
outside the Midwest Conference was
promising.

The men's and women's teams are
both defending their 2004 Midwest
Conference titles this year. '

something to prove

about the conference season after their
performances against Central and Car-
letoir.

The men's soccer team also got a
chance to relax and have a little fun this
past Sunday.The Pioneers put up a win
against former Gi-iiintll college soccer-
players at the Piitsch Alumni Cup on
Sept.«'l,

Rick Lancaster ’76 participated in
his first alumni game this past week-
end. He said that the alumni game ivas
much less intense than the other col-
lege games he remembered. Although
the game was less serious, Lancaster
admitted that everyone was still play—
ing to win.

There was a lot of friendly pushing
and physical contact during the game.
maLing' it clear that the players on both
(cams were playing tough while still
having fun,

Lancaster said that the alumni ctip
matches allowed alumni to relive the

memories of college and have a kind of
reunion, Although Lancaster was the
only member of his class, he said that
he still saw a lot offainiliar faces.

"From the team’s perspective, we're
concerned with playing a good game,
but mostly with not getting injured,"
Hollister said, “But alumni weekend
is really more about seeing old friends
and getting a chance to hang out with
guys who used to play for the same pro-
gram."

Although run and friendship are
more than enough to make the alumni
matches popular, there is also some
thing more on the line. The Pfitsch
Alumni Cup is not just another game.
It's a chance for these Griniiell gradu-
ates to prove that they still have what
it takes.

“Old guys try to prove that age has
no effect on them," Lancaster said.
"Old guys can play and young guys get
a scrimmage."
