(By C, M. Holmes.)
Immediately lifter the Christmas l‘er
csss at the Cololllal theatre, 'will occur
the third annual play or tile Dramatic
Club. This year the Clull will make
somewhat of a change in the character
of the play presented.

“Brown of Harvard” was given; a
light, rollicking college play, the pur.
pose or which was entirely entertain.
ment Last year. another step was
taken toward the realization of the best
in modern drama, when Clyde Fitclre
“Her Own Way" was oifcred. h dru-
nla depicting human liie, bringing out
situations of both humorous and ser
rious character, it emphasizes the
author's vast knowledge of present da)
problems and his ability as the leader
oi our American dramatists, This
year the club has attempted a play or
deeper significance than those here
toiorc and will present what, in a
sense, may be called a problem playk
an adaptation of Zaugwiii's “The Melt.
lng For.”

in this play, the drama is used as
a medium for a great message. it is
therefore, a ”purpose play" or, in an
other sense, a “problem play.” The
play is a story oi the assimilation oi
the immigrant and the development or
the foreigner into an American cltir
zen.

violinist from l<ishinefi, lives with his
uncle on Staten Island, New York. The

"It seems to me," said Proicss -
Pierce, "Lllai. the aim oi the rollcge

knowledge and appreciation oi the

merely by listening to good music, but
by so adjusting ourselves to the needs
of the times that every strident who
desires it, may obtain, while working
ior his degree, a broad knowledge or
