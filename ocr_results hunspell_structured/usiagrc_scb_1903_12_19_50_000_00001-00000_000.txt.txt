Last night's program at the
Home Ol'alnt'ltal Contest was one
of Excepllonal importance and
enjoyment, The fairly large
audience that l‘lltd assembled in
the chapel to hear lheproductions
gave evidence in their hearty ap-
plause of all the numbers on the
program, of a wholesome and
deep seated interest in the. cause
of oratory, The winner or ﬁrst
place, Mr. Harold D. Hutchins,
'05, is to represent the college at
the State Contest, to beheld here

The ﬁrst speaker called upon
was Mr. w. E. Paul, '05. His
subject, The Main-spring ofSuc-
cess, was treated in Mr. Paul's
clear decisive style and with all
the force and emphasis that have
made his debating power what it
is. Tlleelemcnts OfSthceSS, said
Mr. Paul are heredity, environ-
merit and will. Byciting speciﬁc
cases from the pages ot history.
it was shown that, powerful as the
ﬁrst two factors may be in the

total of success, the one great and
allrconquering iorcc is the Power
of Will. Mr. Paul spoke ﬁrst on
the program in the absence of
George W. Blatherwick, whose
continued illness made it impos

sible tor him to compete.
The subiect which had been

chosen by J, John Heeren, ’05,
the next speaker was, Bismark,
the Man of Blood and Iron. Mr.
Heeren’s oration was full of deﬁn~
ite historical allusions in kind and
quantity which showed the speak»
er to be thoroughly familiar with
the course ofContinental History.
Though the work of Bismark’s

life accomplished wonders for the
German people and has resulted
in lrett endous good to the whole
of the modern worldBismark him
self was far from success as a man,
Tricl-ct-y, deceit, underltand prac
tices and tyranny accomplished
great results under his maniptllar
tion but Bis'malk himself failed

in that he had not given at his

Service as an Irleal was the sub-
ject of Mr. Hutcltlns' oration. It
was dcllvcl'ed in n more (leliberr
ale and precise way than were any
orthcothcrs. Hts proposition is
clearly contained in the title of
the oration, and in the course ot’
the argument Mr. Hutchins led
up to the end that the true Iltncr
tion of man should be the renders

A, G. Walters was last to speak.
The Race Problem was treated in
a brief historical fashion, The
delivery was perhaps more spirit—
ed than that of any of the others
The success of our solution of the
race problem will decide the desd

tion is the only one practical.

The uniform excellence in de-
livery oi all the speakers is a high
tribute to the work of the man
who has drilled them in this de—
partment. Tllztt Mia Ryan‘strain-
mg was a large factor In making
the contest what it was there can
be no doubt. The fact that our
representative is still to be under
his care is sufﬁcient guarantee
that Mr. Hulchlns will represent
Iowa College at the Contest in a
way that will do us lull justice.
