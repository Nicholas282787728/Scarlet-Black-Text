made it very uncomtortable for
the spectators. a few loyal rooters
saw our team defeat Drake Uni-
versity by the above score. on
Thanksgiving day, at Des Moines.
Notwithstanding the light
which had fallen from early morn-
ing, the ground was not slippery,
and the day was satistactory so
far as the game was concerned.

punt, in the second half, when he
twisted and dodged through al»
most the entire Drake team.
Douglass’ long runs, and Wheel-

say, behind good interterence. re-
gained all the territory covered
by the kick, and even added a few

For the remaining ten minutes
of the half the play was much
slower, and Drake showed at times
very good form. The most Slrlkr

Drake’s goal line. Score, 12 to at

The intermission between the
halves was shortened by ﬁve min-
