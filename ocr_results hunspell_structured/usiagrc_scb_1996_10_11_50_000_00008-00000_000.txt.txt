After a tough 2-1 loss to
Monmouth on Sunday. the Grinnell
College men‘s soccer learn has a
little time to regroup before it re-
sumes league play. The soccernien
travel to Illinois College on Satur-
day and then race Knox in
Galesburg next Wednesday.

“All these games are extremely im»
portant. If we want to play in the
Midwest Conference tournament.
we‘ll need to win the next two
matches," said Coach John Plitsch.
Earlier in the season the Pioneers
downed both I.C. and Knox at
home.

Last week the soccermen began to
build up to the Monmouth contest
with a 670 road victory over Cornell
and a 40 win against Knox at home.
Against the Rams the Grinnellians
wasted little time as Andy Lee
knocked in a cross from Dustin
Gool at 5:28. Goot assisted in the
second goal on a cross to Ryan
McGaiy who headed in the pass at
16:57. Then McGary crossed a ball
to William LeerAshlcy at 25:11 for
the third goal. Defender Darren
Bass scored off a penalty kick at
27:05. Lee added another goal on
an assist from Zach Goldman, and
Chad Stewart completed the barrage
on a header from a Lee-Ashley
cross.

Against Knox, Lee opened the
scoring again at 1400 on an assist

by Stewart. Then Stewart notched
a goal at 32:00 on a cross from
Goldman. Stewart gota second as
sist on the next goal by Lee-Ashley
at 38:00. To complete an outstand—
ing day, Stewart banged home the
final tally at 86:00 on a pass from
Sent Kamara.

“We have had trouble scoring all
year," said Coach Pfilsch. “After the
Cornell and Knox games I thought
we were finally on track."

Monmouth, which has one loss to
Coe, carved out the 2-1 Win with a
goal late in the second half. The
Pioneers opened the scoring in the
first halfas Eric Brue beat the out
side defender and knocked home a
highdriving 10-yarder. The Scots
answered with a goal in the middle
of the second period. The deciding
goal came Wllhjusl four minutes to
play

“Two times late in the game
Monmouth got uncontested shots
because our defenders’ feet got
tangled up," explained Pfitsch.

’ “Losing in the ﬁnal minutes was dis

appointing because we had more
control of the ball and more shots
on goal. We just couldn’t find the
net. I believe Monmouth is the best
team in the division at this time.
Our game with them was a typical
hard-fought contest."

Pfitsch sald: “LC. always plays us
tough. We have time to regain our
focus and get our game back, if we
do we should fare well."

Women kickers take two more

steps on road to MWC tourney
Coach pleased with discipline and depth of team

By SETH KLEIMAN

Sports Information

With only ﬁve regular-season cone
tests remaining, the Grinnell College
women‘s soccer team is pleased with
its position as it sets its sights on the
Midwest Conference tournament.
Their remaining matches will be cru-
cial in determining the post-season
outcome for the Pioneers. However,
ifthe team continues to play With the
high level of intensity it has shown
thus far, it should have no problem
earning a chance to fight for the
MWC crown.

Last Thursday the Pioneers took
one more step toward this goal by
knocking off a tough Coe squad, Zr
0. Although the Pioneers struggled
with passing and possession in the
first half, the second halfwas a com
pletely different story as Carey
Rodeheffer started it off with a goal
merely 40 seconds into the half to
put Grinnell on top. 1-0. “It was
great to get that ﬁrst goal because it
picked ourintensity up," said Coach
Jenny Wood. “We had been having
trouble with our attack, but we im-
proved our short game and got the
ball into the corner which helped us
score."

Despite the lead the game remained
close as the Kohawks riddled the Pier

neer goal with shots. Fortunately,
goalkeeper Erin Doyle proved to be
solid for Grinnell. deﬂecting any
thing that came her way. “Erin
played exceptionally well and we
stayed in the game because of her
hard work." said Wood. “She really
kept up the energy level for the whole
team and was a catalyst for the other
players to feed off of." This high
intensity was reﬂected late in the
game when Rodeheffer netted her
second goal, thus sealing a Pioneer
victory. “I was pleased to get this
win because it showed that our plays
ers are able to respond after a dis
couraging first half." Wood said.
“This should build our confidence as
the postseason approaches."
Saturday it was clear that the Pio-
neets had a great deal of confidence
as they faced a welleskillcd, athletic
Wheaten team. From the start the
kickers established themselves
physically and strongly stepped up
to their nonrconferencc challengers.
Everyone was playing well and the
game proved to be a see~saw battle
as both teams had numerous oppor-
tunities but were unable to convert.
With time winding down in the sec-
ond half and the match still score-
less, Wheaten chipde in a shot from
about 25 yards out to go up 1—0.
which proved to be the winning mar-

gin. “It was unfortunate to come out
on the losing side ofa game in which
we worked so hard," said Wood,
“But I was pleased with our effort.
We knew that they would be a good
team and we were with them every
step of the way. I feel they scored
on us the only way that they could
on that day," she said.

Sunday the Pioneers were able to
put the disappointing loss behind
them by defeating Monmouth, 3-0,
“1 was impressed that we came back
after the Wheaten game and dis-
played such discipline." said Coach
Wood. “We controlled the game
from the outset and everyone was
able to get a lot of quality minutes.
Overall, the team really played well
and I was happy to see the depth that
is developing on this team." Molly
Moilanen, Amy Robinson and
Kendra Potz netted goals.

Now the Pioneers must focus on
winning their remaining games as the
season comes to a close. ”The Sea-
son may be ending, but we arejust
heating up." said Wood. “We have
been preparing for the end of our
schedule all season long and we want
to play at our highest level," she said.
The Pioneers will take on Illinois
College at home this Sunday at 1:00
pm.
