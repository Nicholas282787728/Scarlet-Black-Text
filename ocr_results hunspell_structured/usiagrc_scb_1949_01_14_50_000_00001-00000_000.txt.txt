Duke Tells Seniors
Of Job Possibilities
For College Grads

Dean G. Lester Duke addressed
the senior class after dinner in
Cowlcs dining room Thursday.

During the Christmils houdays
Mr. Duke visited some of the
other college and university

these to be general trends: there
is a definite tightening up on
jobs; business and industry will
be hiring less college‘g'mdlmtes

Thc two most crowded fields
todny seem to ho sociology and
physical education for men. in
the touching field there are more
job opportunities open in the ele-
mentary grades than in secon»
dary grhdcs, and the fields with
the most opcrrlngs are English,
music. drama, and women's phys-
ical education.

During the remainder of the
ycar, interviewers will be coming
to the college from different
business concerns to interview
graduating seniors, Notices of
these representatives will be
posted on the bulletin board out-
side Mr. Duke's office. in the

.union, and any senior wishing to

make an appointment for any of
those interviews should contact
the placement office.

In order to get all the senior
credentials in order, all seniors

,have been requested to tum in

the information blanks which
were given to them in October.
The seniors have also been asked
to turn in four pictures of them»
selves so that the placement hur»
eau may use them when sending
in applications for job

Charles McMiirray, president of
the senior class, spoke about a
gift to the college. A vote was
passed to buy equipment for an
