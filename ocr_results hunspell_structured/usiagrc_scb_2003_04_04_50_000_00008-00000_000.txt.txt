Because Ripley's was willing to pick up the mb, the pair was
hoping to ﬂy to a new climbing lotation,

to let off at Griniiell’s Fall Break. Tschida
said Ripley's “ended up paying me to drive
out to Rapid City... It's a ten hour drive.”

Mostly undeterred, Tsehida and
Hamilton ﬁrst ehose Harney Peak again.
But daey were refused a permit: “Apparently," Tsehiela said, “it is
a wilderness area and they didn't want stilts.” So instcad, the
