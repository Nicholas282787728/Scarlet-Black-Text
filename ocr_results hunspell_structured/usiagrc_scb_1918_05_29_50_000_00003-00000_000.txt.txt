. The lilnc Bird

The attraction at the Strand tomor-
row and Thursday will be an Artcratt
super-picture, adapted by Charles
Maigne, train “The Blue Bird," by
Maurice Maeterlinck. The ﬁlming of
this big spectacle is said to have been
a stupendous undertaking, requiring
many months or time, and the use of
every photographic trick ever conceiv-
ed, as well the origination of many
new ones. When the famous Belgian
author wrote his masterpiece he little
thought that it would he immortalized
in motion pictures by an American or-
ganization. And while the spirit of the
poet rambled in idyllic ﬁelds, the glori-
ﬂed pictures that were conceived in his
pregnant mind were recorded with his
pen, and the world had to be content
with the imaginary visions conjured
by the cold tyre.

Scnndnl

, Portraying the role of the worst
spoiled girl in America, Constance Tal-
madge as Beatrix Vanderdyke in
"Scandal," the new Select production,
gives an exceedingly clever study or
the pampered New York debutante,
self willed and high tempered, but
strangely appealing in her moments ot
sweetness. The picture will be shown
next Thursday and Friday at the Lyric
theatre and promises to hit the high
Water mark in popularity.

MRS. Mlllllillll Ill HEBITAL

One or the most promising student
voices listened to in crlnnell for some-
time was heard in Herrick Chapel
last evening when Mrs. Clyde B. Mor-
gan appeared in recital, Mrs. Morgan
is studying with Prof. A. D. Cain. Mrs.
Cain played the accompaniments.

The ﬁrst two groups were selec—
tions trom operas to which Mrs. Mor-
gan's voice was best suited. She sang
the songs in italian pardonlarly well.

Mrs. Morgan's notes were strong
and well sustained. She possesses a
voice nt rare quality, allowing rnoch
shading. The interpretations were
almost perfect.
