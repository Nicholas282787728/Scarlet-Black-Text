Choir Presenis
Annua! Concert
Sunday Evening i

The Grinnell college choir,
under the direction of David
Bruce Secular, will give its
home concert Sunday at 3 pm.
in Herrick chapel. Jane Gaddis,
Haines senior. is the accom—
panist.

The choir returned Wednes—
day from a four—day tour, hav-
ing sung concerts in Harlan,l
Perry, Atlantic, Glenwood. and
Council Bluffs in Iowa. and
Omaha, Nebr.

The home concert will be
much the same as that de-
claimed by Martin W. Bush,
music critic for the Omaha
World Herald. .

Among the numbers will be
early sacred music by Weelkes,
De Lassus, and Corsi, which he
said were "especially notable”
and projected"‘Gothic mystie
cism and exaltatian He
said Bach’s ”Jesus, Priceless
Treasure” was an example of
”clean articulation of florid
passages in the granite-like
solidity of an excerpt from
Bach." _

A cantata. "Rejoice. Beloved
Christians" by Buxtehude, was
considered by Bush as "especst
ially laudable for the clearnessl
of enueiation accorded the.‘
English translation."

l

The choir will also sing a

group of contemporary French

pieces by Milhaud, Ravel. and

Poulenc. The last part of the

program will include folk songs
and Negro spirituals.

Grinnell students will have an
opportunity to dance to the
music of a big name band Fri-
day night, March 14, at Grin-
nell's first military ball.

Besides boosting the appear.
ance of a name band, the hue
college dance will feature the
crowning of an honorary cadet
colonel and three honorary cadet
lieutenant colonels.

The Friday night date was
decided upon this week by
the steering and entertainment

committees and Lt. Col.
Thomas A. Howell.

“We are really going to do this
first military dance up right."
Howell stated enthusiastically at
a joint meeting of all committees
last Thursday. ”We are going to
make the military ball an ans
nual event that the whole
campus will want to attend,"

The dance is being held on
Friday night for two reasons,

man of the entertainment com-
mittee. A bigger and better band
can be secured for less' money
on Friday. and the money that
would ordinarily be spent on a
band will be used on other
phases of the dance. A name
band which has already been
contacted, will be announced at
a later date.

The honorary cadet colonel
and honorary cadet lieutenant
colonels will be chosen from
candidates nominated by
AFROTC cadets from each of
the north campus halls.
“Everyone is going to get
their money’s worth," Howell de-
clared when asked about the
ticket selling venture. “By sell.
ing tickets to help cover the
expense of hiring a good name
band, we will be able to offer
the biggest evening’s entertains
merit Grinnell students have
ever seen,”
