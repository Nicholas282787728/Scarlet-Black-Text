Mock trial team caps off its season

with a trip to Nationals in Florida

3v DAVID MONTGOMERY

In the last wcckcnd ofJanuary, rhc Grinnell Mock
Trial team traveled to Loras College in Dubuque for
a tournament. After competing for two grueling days
in court, the team cut out before the awards ceremony
to head back to Grinnell. 1: Was only later that they
found out that they had been singled out for a “civilr
ity” award based on their conduct before leaving. “The
irony of that is what in many ways defines the Mock
Trial team," said team member Nate Gates '08.

The mock trial team kicked off its hell week has
fore spring break by ﬂying to Florida and competing
against {our other teams at Nationals. The team won
three oftheir judges'ballots, lost tour and tied on an»
other. It did not advance to the next level.

“It felt .. atisfying to be there," said team memr
ber Chris Jo nston '09. “It was a tournament that we
had earned going to. The level [or competition] was
deﬁnitely high."

The team had originally planned to compete in
a dirfcrcnr national compctirion in Minnesota over
spring break, but chose Florida because it didn't con»
ﬂict With the Grinnell Singers’ trip to Europe.

Mock trial participants fill the roles of attorneys
or witnesses and argue out a case before two judges.
The teams are ranked on individual performance by
two judges at each trial and those rankings are totaled
to determine the winner.

“As they’re calculating it, [the judges] don’t know
who wins the case," said Gates. “They're just grading
the various aspects of the performance for the witr

, nesses and the attorneys."

The same case is used all year, with slight changes
as the season progresses. Each team prepares argur
ments for both the prosecution and the defense, and
presents each side twice at a tournament.

Grinncli's team was founded cighr [O 10 ycnrs
ago, but team concaptain Emily Scholtcn '06 said that
Grinnellians do well against more established teams.

“we think really well on our frcr,wc’rc smart kids,”
said scholrcn. "We're going against kids from other

schools who

Local attorney Brad McCall has helped coach the
team for the last two years.

“They had basically bccn a self-coached team in
the past,” said McCall, a trial attorney with Brierly
Charnetski LLP in Grinnell. “They actually had it
very well organized." McCall has focused on helping
the team improve its handling of rules of evidence.

McCall has also helped in more dircrt wnys. The
team couldn’t get funding for a tournament at Ma-
cnlcstsr College. McCall stepped in to fill the gap. “1
suggested to [team adviser and Associitc Dean for
Experiential Education] Steve Langerud that I would
talk to local law firms and solicit some funds to pay for
that trip,"said McCall.“I’d say] raised half the ﬁnds
that were nccesssry, Stcvc paid for the other hilt."

, Grinnell’s prosecution team was Laura Dobbs ’06,
Ben Hering’09 and Johnston is itrorncys, and Gates,
Adrianne Klein ’08 and Christina Reynolds '08 as
witnesses.The defense team consisted of Klein, Herr
ing and Johnston as attorneys, and David Blum ’08,
Katie Banani '09 and Dobbs as witnesses.

Rape drug investigation continues

With no suspects and a resolution unlikely, focus shifts to education, prevention

The night before 100 Days, Trevor Hanan ’07 crpscrsd a fun,
relaxed cvcning pnrtying in Rose with two friends. "There was
nothing particularly sketchy about the pnrry," he said. But nttcr u
couplc drinks from a pirchcr orbccr, he felt too sick to stay out and
returned to his room. After sleeping the better part ofthc next day,
feeling sick nnd wnking up with almost no memory ofthe prcvious
night, all thrcc students realized they had fallen victim to n dsngcr
they did not associate with Grinnell Collegeidate mpc drugs.

This case joins other unsolved cases of date rape drug use at
Grinnell. Almost six months after another Grinnell student reportr
ed feeling the effects ofdate rape drugs, Grinnell police nrc no closer
to ﬁnding the perpetrator.Two reported cases of date rape drugs on
campus this year have forced college administration, Security and
the Grinnell Police Department to look into methods ofprevention,
since investigating and ﬁnding those responsible is almost impos-
Sible unless someone comes forward with information,

To determine ifsomeone has ingested date rape drugs, tests must
be run within 24 hours otconsumption, meaning victims who wake
up with memory loss are often ineligible for testing. According
to College Security Lieutenant Amy Coleman,
cases almost alvmys come in too late for testing.
“Thcrc's no way to prove it,"she said.

victims’ drinks and cause a variety of symptoms.

Ecstasy is a lcss well-known date rape drug, —Suzanne P0" 08

which can also be givcn to people unknowingly

This dnig, although often taken recreationally, creates hcightcncd
need for physical contnct and can lower the ability to refuse sexual
advances.

Captain Tim Sittig ofthe Grinnell Police Dspirtmcnt believes
that many date rape drug cases do not get reported due either to
incmory loss or knowing use of drugs like Ecstasy. According to
Sitrig, these cases occur primarily on campus,

Sittig believes students are less likely to consider thc legal implis
cations of these attempts. “[D]octoring a drink without someone’s
knowledge is n felony,"he said,

”A lot aistudents operate
with tile assumption that all

and that (an be dangerous

After the second report of these drugs, Joint Board formed the
Safety and Security Advisory Committee (SSAC). The committee,
which includes Joint Board Senators, a student Security employee,
Dean of Student Life Jen Krohn and Director of Security Steve
Briscoc, is reviewing security policies ind looking into methods or
date rape prevention.

Chris Hall '07, SGA presidentrelect and a member ofthe SSAC,
hopes to get the college to purchase the Drink Detector. a capsule
that,whcn droppcd into a drink,will chrngs color ifa date rape drug
is present. “lfwe can make it that condoms are available at a rate of
two per day, why can't this be?"hc said.

The Feminist Action Coalition (FAC) plans to have panel dis-
cussion to educate studcnts on the subject. “Everybody knows don't
leave your drink alone, but that’s about it," said Theresa Bruckner
0o, coslcidcr of FAC. Thc panel will feature representatives from
DVA/SAC, the Grinnell Police Department, the hospital and the
mental health center, and will explain symptoms, means of preven-
tion and managing the cttscts ofthe drugs.

Security also runs its oWn programs to promote education and
awareness. Coleman conducts Campus Date Rape Prevention and
Education every Thursday night from 5:30 to 7
pm. in the Forum Coffeehouse. This program
gives tips and guidance on protecting oneself
from situations in which date rips is likely, but
attendance is generally low.

Coleman,with Grinnell Police SergeantTher

Defense class the week of April 17. This class,
which normally costs 835 to $45, is free to all
women on campus and will (ruin participants in
self-defense. Coleman and Petersen haveroffered
the class at least once a ycir since 2000, but this
year‘s class is questionable because only two students have contacted
Coleman.

Bruckncr bclicvcs the college is limited in its ability to nct her
crust students do not want to consider chnnging the school’s alcohol
policy. “I don't think you can address the issue or date rnpc drugs
without addressing alcohol," she said. Alcohol is lcgully a date rnpc
drug and sex with soniconc inroxicntcd is considered rape.
