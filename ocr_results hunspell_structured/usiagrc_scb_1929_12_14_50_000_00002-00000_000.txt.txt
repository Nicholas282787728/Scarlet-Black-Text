wI-IATTHE SEM FEE OFFERS

The statement of Nathan Milstein, violinist, after
his concert in Herrik chapel last Wednesday, that
"For small cities like Grinnell to have concertsiin
Europe it is not so" is indicative of an advantage offered
on the campus which only a minority of Grinnellians
fully realize. During the year there are many such
events on the lecture and music program to which the
Send Fees are tickets of admission, but few Crinnellians
neter the door in campus life which those little squares
of pasteboard open to them.

There are probably two reasons for this apparent,

lack of interest. One of them is the ordinary student's
failure to appreciate the wonderland of art. literature,
exploration, and science that is thus opened to him and
which is expressly provided for his enjoyment and cul-
tural development. Certainly no student would miss the
opportunity to attend such a program of concerts by
accomplished artists and interesting lectures by leading
men in widely diversified fields, if he fully realized the
enjoyment that he might derive from it.

The other probable reason for apparent lack of
interest is that a student may have attended at some
time a concert which did not please him or a lecture
which though interesting in subject matter may have
been disappointing in the manner in which it was pre-
sented. Then because that student does not have to

pay cash at the door each time he wants to attend a
lecture or concert, he considers them so lightly that he
does not make the experiment a second time. It is worth
trying again, however.

Milstein’s statement holds true, in a certain measure
at least, in America also, for Crinnell offers advantages
ivhicli are not to be found in many towns of its size—
advantages which are lacking in the towns from which
comes a large percent of Grinncll‘s student population.
The programs are arranged entirely for the enjoyment
and interest of the students and faculty and they are
potentially an admirable accomplishment of the purpose
of their arrangement; it only remains for more students
to realize their full value and then enjoy the advantages
offered here. A. E.. T.

TIIE ATHLETIC SITUATION AT IOWA

Throughout the past month, the attention and
sympathies of Grinnell students have been largely direct.-
ed toward the athletic situation at the state University,
which resulted in Iowa's rejection from the Big Ten last
Saturday. Two points merit consideration; both reflect
prevalent attitudes on the Grionell campus ‘

First, it does not seem that the Big Ten hoard had
the right to adopt an “holler than thou" attitude toward
Iowaewitness the Carnegie Report—and eject Iowa
from the conference, and second, Iowa's sincere attempts
in the past few months, intensified in the past two
weeks, to clean up any infraction of the amateur code
eisting on her athletic policies, warrant her re-admit-
Lance to the conference at once.

If the midwestcrh public were startled by the an-
nouuccment that Iowa was to be dropped from the Big
Ten‘ they were astonished doubly by the Carnegie Report
issued on Octoberr 23 of this year. This repart clearly
stated that the recruiting and siihsidiing of athletes at
Wisconsin, Northwestem, Purdue and Michigan were
especially noticeable; it found Iowa guilty only in a
minor- way.

But did such facts influence the members of the
Big Ten board to take a really charitable stand toward
Iowa last week? Hardly, if newspaper accounts of
Iowa's plea for reinstatement may he believed, Rather,
as Harlan Miller said in the Des Moincs Register last
Sunday, thc faculty members on the Big Ten boards,
convinced that they were guided by implacable abstrac-
tions of right and wrong, adopted an uncompromising
attitude toward Iowa. Professor James Paige of Minna
sota was one member who, for example, refused to face
the facts. In the face of the knowledge that one of
Minnesota’s football stars gets $150 a month to serve as a
bouncer at an exclusive Minnesota restaurant two hours
a day, he voted to oust Iowa.

Perhaps such an attitude would have been excusable
if Iowa had not in the last six months done a great deal
Lo clean up the infractions of the amateur code of which
she has been accused. But she has, as those who have
followed her actions know, .

Then this week come the news that fourteen Iowa
athletes had been suspended from competition because
Lhey owed small amounts to a trust fund for athletes at
Iowa, Whether or not the fund is to be condemned.
the fact remains that Iowa has tried and is trying to go
the whole way in restoring conditions in her athletic
policies satisfactory to everyone.

To students of Crinnell, to the mass of the people
in Iowarin fact, it seems that Iowa has been dealt with
unfairly; at least she has been judged by schools more
to be condemned than she, If, however. she has erred.
ihe has been punished. Her repentance is sincere.

Such facts would seem to warrant that the Big Tem
should readmit Iowa without delay; having done this,
it would be well for the conference to etend to half
a dnen other schools the accusations rst brought against
Iowa, Such is the only way to do Iowa justice.
