Monmouth Ou’rscores Grinnell, 28-I3;
Team Finishes in Conference Cellar

by Hull Pothoven

\

. Last year history in thls papei- contained this line- “Better
things should be. in store for Grlnnell students and fans next year."
This was referring to the 1952 Pioneer g‘rld team and thc writer

then went on to give some very
statement. This was not only the

good. arguments to back up his
opinion of one person, but that

of many close followers of the team.

Last week, this same team that looked so promising on paper
a year ago went down to its eighth consecutive defeat of the year.
This time the conquel'er was Monmouth, who turned the trick by
a 2843 score. in reverse of their usual habit of playing a good “‘gh‘i 3““ Lang“ be“ Cla‘k
first half and then failing to keep up the necessary steam in the 5 ‘0 1- The Kelleyme“ W‘PIByEd
second, the Scarlets found themselves on the short and of a 28-7iG3153 472. on. Tuesdayr

count that they couldn‘t over—i

come after the intermission.

For not the first time this
‘year the Pioneers held the
statistical edge but didn’t have
scoring punch which is the de-
ciding factor. Monmouth, which
ended up in third place in
the Midwest loop, was continu-
ally outplayed by their op-
ponents but closed the door on'
all but two Pioneer scoring
drives

Grinnell’s first score came afr
ter Sam Petroff raced 47 yards
to the Scot‘s three after babbling
the ball on a punt attempt at
midfield. Chuck Dunhai—n then
passed to ‘Harv Golden in the
end zone to tie the game at
seven all. Grinnell‘s other score
came in the third period on a
short plunge by John McClin-
took.

After the first Scarlet score,
Monmouth raced back for three
quick scores which were all they
needed to sew up the decision.

Why? What happened? That is
the question that is bothering
Grinnell followers and perhaps
the coaches and team also. In-
experience certainly cannot be
used as a reason again this
time; there were 15 lettermen
back.

Lack of spirit? This too seems
to he vetoed, fur the team al-
ways seemed to have the will to
win, especially against th_el
stronger opponents. Overconil-
dense then7 Surely not thlsi
from a team that was rated the
underdog in all but one game.

Perhaps injuries and a lack
of reserve strength? Here we
seem to have something that
did perhaps help to darken the
Pioneer record.
