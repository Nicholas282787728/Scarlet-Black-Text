AN INTEDESTING

By Curtis Harnack—
Clark hall is noted for its journ-
alists, Dibble is noted for its
spirit, Haines cottage has its
hellers, Mears cotmge has its
traditions, but Pine Tree Place
has its long and checkered his-
tory.

Pine Tree was built in 1902 by
the father of Mr. J. L. Fellows,
who now resides at 512 Tenth
street here in Grinnell.

Some of the pine trees were
brought out to Iowa from New
York state, were planted, and
flourished in the fertile Iowa soil.
The story goes that Mrs. Fellows
was a nature lover and was re-
sponsible for planting the other
trees. When she took hikes in
the woods. she dug up little secd-
lings, brought them home, and
planted them in the back yard.
She cared for them well, because
the huge, well»formed pines, fir,
and cedar are standing straight

and tall behind Pine Tree Placel

In June, 1924, the place was
bought by the college and louis
V. Phelps, treasurer, says “The

contribution of Mr. and Mrs, J.
L. Fellows helped the college very-
materially in acquiring this prop-
‘erty.”

College Hospital
For the next five years the
lodor of freshly scrubbed floors
and medicated soap was wafted
‘through the halls where the nurse
in starched. white costume, as-
sumed her duties in the new col-
lege hospital—Pine Tree Place.
It was with fond memories that
Miss Bethana McCandless, regis-,
ltl‘ar, told your reporter about her

lived three years in the housei
from 1930 to 1933. It was dur-'
,ing this time that President Main
named it Pine Tree Place because
of the pines in the back yeard,‘
Of all the days of her life at:
Pine Tree, Miss McCandless says
her most memorable was the ev-
ening she and the other ladies
planted the shrubs surrounding
the house. The late Miss Reed,

Sideline Speculations and

and Twyliah

Last Saturday afternoon saw the
last two scheduled games of the
volleyball intramural, when
Read walked away from Main
with a score of 56 to 8. and
Mears eluded the fatal bottom
rung by also defeating Main, as
to 31. t

This still left a three way tie
for second place between Read,
Haines, and James. A miniature
tournament was held Tuesday af-
ternoon to place these three
teams.

First came the ReadrHaines
game. Read won, 43-33, but only
after Hoines had exerted a val-
iant spurt the last few minutes
of the game, bringing the scores
uncomfortably close‘ together. Read
held the lead all through the
game, but the last few minutes
showed the best ball handling on
the part of both teams.

Immediately after this game,
Haines played James, This game
was even more exciting and full

driven up with some shrubs from
out of town.

They decided to plant them that
evening, so Miss McCandless and
the others began digging troughs
and planting shrubs by the glow
of the headlights on Miss Read‘s
car, When,finally finished, with

ltheir dirty hands and With ache

ing backs, Miss McCandJess said,
“We felt we had earned the right
to call Pine Tree Place our home.”

In 1933 Miss McCandless and
the other three ladies had to
give up their big screened-in
porch where they often slept in
the summer time, their little kit-
chen. dining room, and sunny
rooms of Pine Tree Place when
the former Dean of the College,
Dr. Beatty, and his family moved

Annex For Seniors

During the summer of 1935 the
house was completely remodeled.
redecorated and refurnished. A
whole section was added, hallways
were cut, partitions were built.
porches were built in, and the
place was made an annex. for
senior women with Mrs. Elizabeth
Hensley as housemother. Pine
Tree Place was the beauty spot
of the campus. Students and fac-
ulty members inspected its intern
ior with awe, and marvelled at
the decorating.

From 1937 till the fall of 1942,
Pine Tree Place led a monotonous
life housing the overﬂow of fresh
men women and a few office sec-
retell-lea.

Change of Name

The army moved onto Grinnell
campus. so in the fall of 1942
the Rawson men moved in and
changed the house name to Raw—
son Tree.
were the Rawson men inhabitants
of Pine Tree Place, and then the
mark men moved in with Mrs,
Martin as housemother, and once
again the name was changed-—
this time to Clark Tree.

Last year the house was used
as an overflow for freshmen wo-
men. But this year the pungent
odor of pipe tobacco has replaced
the smell of dainty per-fumes. The
stairway is wearing down under
size twelve and thirteen shoes,
instead of the tiny five and one—
half’s. This year, again, the cluh~
room door closes on Monday
nights and the paddles crack and
the wood splinters on mischievous
preps, This year, once again, the

‘mem have moved into Pine Tree

Place.

|‘Schololrsl'lip Board
Urges Sfudenl‘s To
Accep+ Reduc+ions

All students currently holding
scholarships at Grinnell college
were asked by Dr. Samuel N.
lStevens, at a meeting last week,
to seriously consider accepting
‘and volunteering for reductions in
the amounts of their grants.

Dr. Stevens said that war con<
ditions and problems had caused
a decrease in the amount of
money available for scholarships.
This fact, coupled with the large
number of very capable students
who are applying for assistance in
financing their college education
has led the scholarship commit-
ytee to ask current beneficiaries to
iconslder whether they need all
the money that is awarded them.

‘ Dr, Stevens pointed out that
scholarships are not granted as
a token of recognition of ability
[but as a token of the recognition
,of need for financial aid. He
,pointed out that the trend has
lbeen to look to the honor of a
scholarship as a reward of ability,
,overlooking that it is a grant
for need.

Since economic conditions have
changed, the committee hopes that
some students may feel that they
can afford to share some of their
funds with incoming students who
might not otherwise be able to

’attend Grinnell.

The ability to use the student
loan set-up and campus employ-
ment were pointed out as other
means of making the money ne-
cessary for financing a college
education.
