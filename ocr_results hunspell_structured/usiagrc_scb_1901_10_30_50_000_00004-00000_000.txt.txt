The

 

SENIOR CLASS PARTY AN ENJOY-
ABLE AFFAIR.

OnSaturdaynightanothernoteh
\vascut in the long stick which
records the good times enjoyed
by lgoz. The event was a moon~
light party amidst rustic surround
rugs. Assembling at Blair Hall
immediately aftel seven, tlle class
proceeded to the chosen spot in
two stiaiv-coverecl racks and ims
mediately upon arrival began to
fl‘aternize in the genial manner so
characteristic of ’02,

The party was held ina new
barn a few miles from town. The
ﬂoor had been covered with sevr
eral inches of straw, and the moon,
assisted by two rows ot japanese
lanterns, furnished an abundance
otlight. Here the Virginia reel
was indulged in and games were
played until the ﬂeeting hours
compelled the merry-maltcrs to
desist and, lollowing the illstrtlcr
tions of the social committee,
seated themselves ill the straw
covered area and partook ot the
hot tamales, cottce and apples
provided tor them. Then the
wagons were again called into
tequisition for the homeward ride.
An evening more suitable could
not have been chosen. The re
mark heard after previous parties
washeard again,totheefiectthatit
was the best party held so far.
Miss Millerd, Miss Smith, Mr.
Douglass, Mr. Nollen and Mr,
Hendrixson chaperoncd the class.

WEST HIGH vs. GRINNELL

Ward Field will be the scene of
another football game next Satur-
day afternoon. This time the
Grinnell high school will line up
against the team from the Wcst
Des Moines high school and an
excellent game is assured. Those
two teams are among the strongest
in the state and one or the other
of them :ihould win the champion

ship. No high school team has
scored on Grinnell and the West
Des Moines team has been almost
as successful. SCARLET/m0 BLACK
urges evcry student to attend the
game and return as tar as possible
the loyalty that the high school
has shown to the college. There
are no more staunch supporters of
our 'Varslty than the members of
the high school ~and here is a
chance for us to shotv that we ap-
preciate their support by return-
ing it. Let all who cowgo and
help bring the high school chant-
pionsllip to Grinnell,

THE LEWIS SOCIETY ENTER-

have an enviable reputation as ens

The Lewis boys

tertainers.whichthismeetinglully
justiﬁed.

No literary program had been
provided. the object of the meet
ing being entertainment pure and

simple. The evening was passed

in playing the usual games, the
time-honored Virginia reel being
perhaps the most: popular. Later
in the evening ice cream and cake
were served.

These joint meetings of the so-
cieties have a value beyond the
mere temporary enjoyment they
afford. They give themernbers
an opportunity to become aCr
quainted and to form friendships,
which the ordinary contact in the
class-room does not afford. Es-
1pettially is this true of the Acaci—
emy. so many at whose members
are new to the college. And in
after years these events are looked
back upon as among the most
pleasant rnerdents ot one's college
life.
