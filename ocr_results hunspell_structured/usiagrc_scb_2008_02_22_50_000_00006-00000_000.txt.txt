For the outgoing Grinnell student,
a trip to Hlmis is usually penciled into
the weekend agenda, as a place to relax
and have tun. But for ACE seeuriry
srudcnr workei-s, Harris par-ties present
a challenge (0 maintain order while not
policing their peers. By having orudcnt
security, parties like Harris can Innii‘r
tain a relaxed atmosphere that might
not be possible it Campus Security pa-

Emphasizing this poinr an ACE
Security \vorkers' uniforms \Vith a
simple black shirt that has "scctn'iry"
written on the back. many students
might not even notice that the workers
are not paitying.

“I think that the less uniform we
wear, the less or a presence we make,
and that is always our goal," said Ben
Howort '09, one of the ACE directors
“We are not policing people."

While studentrsccurlry does not
want to police, they are still the ones
to maintain order when things get out
of hand, and sometimesﬁae uniforms
don't help them

“People don't realize that you’re see
curity right away," Howort said, “so I've
just had people hit me when I‘m trying
(0 break up a ﬁght."

Diffusing situations can b: difﬁ-
cult, but many security workers try to
ease situation
before it gets
worse. ”I can

one time last
year when we
netually had
to call campus
security,” said
Head of ACE
Security Veronqiuc Porter ’03 in a Nov.
interview. “It hasn’t escalated to larger
things in a while." -

ACE Security tries to settle disputes
at an event without calling campus se-
curity ifpossiblei But this strategy puts
the burden on the student workers, a

toughjob.

“Most of the time, when
ACE steps in to try to diffuse
the situations, they incur the
assault," Porter said in Novem»
her. “It's not like it happens a
lot, but we've deﬁnitely had
spitters, people throw beer, 0c,
casionally the assault."

Because of such risks, se-
curiry must remain focused on
the task'at hand, and cannot take part
in the pleasures ofHarris.

“You do make a sacrifice, you can't
drink, and you can't party. You have to
work,"said Potter. When security must
step in, a level headed is a must. "We
want people that are assertive but not

angry," said Portcrl

But for her, thejob represents more
than just breaking up drunks at Hare
ris. By working security,
she is taking an active role
in caring for the college
community—selﬁgover-
nnncc in action.

ACE security allows
students monitor other
students, making safety
and security a primarily
student affairl

Vanessa Taylor, RLC for Jamaland,
emphasized the role of seeurity with
regard to self governance. “I haven't
heard of any problems in regards to

ACE and 1 know that rhey have been
