Gymnasium Scene

of Colonial Ball
for Grinncll Coeds

_ Again the women of Grinnell will
appear in voluminous colonial cos~
tumes or quaint dresses of their
grandmother‘s dug from old trunks
in the attic. Again the dancing of
the minuct will feature the evening.
The occasion is the traditional Colour
ial ball sponsored by the Women’s
Athletic association and held on Feb.
20 in the men’s gymnasium.

The hall originated as an entertaiu~
ment for W. A, A. members only
and was formerly held as a formal
dance in the Rand gymnasium. How-
ever, it has, during the last few years,
been given in the men's gymnasium
and includes all Gi-innell women and
faculty members. It is the largest
and most elaborate event sponsored
by the W. A. A. and for that reason
many alumnae return to participate

The balcony is opcn to student spco.

Critics in many of the cities where
the London singers have appeared
have acclaimed them highly. The
New York Times said, “The ensemble
produced a. sort of art which was
utterly charming and delightful. Part
of the result was due to the extra-
ordinary clarity of diction, the finish
of their phrasing and ability of the
singers to catch and to communicate
to their hearers the atmosphere of

‘ the divers moods of their internation-

nl list with authentic flavor.

The Chicago Daily News said the

Cowboys Show lmprovment
in Creighton Loss
This Week

GrinneH'S temperamental cagers, af-
ter sneaking through with a one-point
victory at Coe last week, took two
days of rest this week before starting
work for their second semester sched—
ule. They open their final stretch of
the Missouri Valley conference title
race here Friday against the Okla»
homa Aggies.

Coach Puny James cellar-ridden
Cowboys have lost to every team in
the conference except Drake, The
Pioneer victory at Stillwater was a
slim affair in an overtime period,
however, and the improvement that
the Aggies have shown may be judged
by their performance in holding
Creighton to a 33 to 25 margin Mon-
day. Barlier in the season they lost
to the Bluejays by a 65 to 23 count.

Drills Reserves

Coach John C. Truesdale spent

the final 45 seconds of the game with
Coe college Friday night, the Crinnell
cagcrs managed to eke out a 28—27
victory over the Midwest conference
team on the Cedar Rapids floor. The
encounter was bitterly fought from
start to finish. although the Kohztwks
seemed to hold the upper hand
throughout.

Slightly more than a half minute of
play remained when a time out was
called under the Coe basket with the
score standing 27 to 24 in favor of
Coe. Upon the resumption of play,
Mickey Frye. Grinncll forward. caged
the ball to bring the Pioneers within
one point of a tie score.

At this point, Coach John Truesdale
inserted Paul Ednian, lanky center,
into the lineup with instructions to
