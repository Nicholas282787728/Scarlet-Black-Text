bring new ideas to Grinnell that can dramatically improve
current policies. Administrators noted that comparisons
with other institutions have helped atiengthen students

ieceat adoption and expansion ofgenderrneutral housing as
one example of the effectiveness of following other schools'
leads, Accoiding to Dougharty, “To be able to bring in
outside data and outside research was part ofwhat allowed
us to expand gender-neutral housing."

One trample ofan area for improved professionaliaation
has even been identified by students themselves, some of
whom have complained about a peiceived tendency ofrhe
College to offer positions to the partners ofsoughtsdftcr
faculty candidates as an incentive for woi king at the school.
Too often, they said these individuals were unqualificd and
given employment simply to entice them and their paitnei
to relocate. A standardization and professionalization of
hiringprac ces and qualifications could curtail this practice
and ensure that only the most qualiﬁed candidates are hired.

GRINNELL
EXCEPTIONAAISM

Despite administrators' stated intentions, not all
members of the campus have welcomed the efforts.
students, in particular, rake issue with the application of
national practices at Griiinell because ofa belicfin Grinnell
cxceptionalismithat this college is unique from its "peer
institutions." The school’s espoused philosophy of self
governance, its quirky brand of students, and a long lcgacy
of bucking the mainstream are all cited as examples of
Grinnell's special stature among the cadre of small liberal
arts schoolst Though most would agree new ideas can be
constructive, students arc generally hostile to the idea
that crinneil model itself after some other institution, for
fear of sacriﬁcing its unique culture in the process "For
students,Gtinne11 is an experience. so to professionalize an
experience is to streamline and marginalize it,"Wax said.
“The advertising. the ‘No limits,’ the website all trigger
a fear that that's what's happening, that we're making
Grinnell look like every other liberal arts college."

newer, arguably more sterile buildings, publicity and
recruitment campaigns that ignore what makes Grinnell
”diffetem"7cnuse students to fear that outside influences
lead to standardization and forceo crinncll into a cookie
cutter “mainstream." But while “streamlining“ Grinnell
advertisements and architecture may irritate some students,
students are grated more by perceived "streamlining” in
student Affairs, because their policies affect student life
more directly.

“Houston has worked at so many different institutions
it’s possible that the new administration wouldn’t appreciate
the differences between this place and other schools,” said
Presto. “Ifyou are going to come in here and do all the same
things you've done at other placcs.l don't agree with that."

Both Dougharty and Greene made a point to reach

 

out to students soon after they were hired. They both
attended several onecampus parties eaily iii theii tenures
and after Dougharty's first weeks on campus, the soda
wrote an ediro al praising im foi his “effoit at getting
to know a wide segment of students." But not all students
are convinced that Doughaity and Greene adequately
grasp Griiincll’s ciiltiireithat after only a few months on
campus, how could they? “A lot of people were optimistic
about them in the bog nning because they said . ,‘We want
to get to know Gi-iimell comlnuiiity,'" said l<atcy Gager '11,
an SGA senatoi “It seem like Houston had-done a little bit
of that, but once he had made his point that he had clone a
little bit, he kind ofstopped."

At the December opcn foiiim, communication between
administrators and students was a main topic of concern.
Both Greene and Doughaity said all admi isrratoit aie open
to students coming into their offices with questions, but
some students think administiarors should be more active
in the community. students think they could do more. “I
knew who Houston and Travis aic but, since Houston's first
semester here, I’ve seen him once on campus," Gager said.
“I've talked with plenty of other people who feel the same
way. The only way to contact them is to go directly to theii
office and [students] don’t feel comfortable doing that just
because ofwhat happened last semester

The administration has said that it carefully considers
G iiell's culture and traditions when contemplating policy
changes. All seniorrlevel administrators interviewed were
quick to assert that for any policy change to be effectively
implemented, it must be compatible with the Grinnell
community and its own culture. “If [policy changes] don't
fit the ciinnell cultuie, then they’re not going to work,"
Greene said.

EDUCATORS,
NOT ADMINISTRATORS

The emphasis on “best piactices" can perhaps be viewed
in tandem with a slow shift in the office’s stated role: a shift
from beingjust administrators to being educators. This for
cus on student learning, rather than administrative services,
illustrates a philosophical divide over the best manner of
student affairs administration. Generally, it student affairs
division can be seen as either support staffer as an integral
part of the educational experience. At Grinnell, student
Affairs administrators s:e themselves as educators, “We see
ourselves as folks who play a role in providing students with
an excellent learning environment," Dougharty said. "And
while we may not provide that in the classroom, we piovide
it outsid: the classroom." Dougharty vicws Student Affairs
as a holistic antityinot just a collection of offices on the
third ﬂoor of the campus center and throughout campus,
but a division that has a plate in students daystosday livest
Because students mature while attending college, student
Affairs can have a place in teaching students life skills and
emotional maturity, while also supporting them in that
learning experience, he said,

This perspective is not entirely new. Joyce Stern ’91,
Dean for Student Academic Support and Advising, said
that Student Affairs administrators viewing themselves as
educators and professionals did not start with Dougharty's

“é’irtker

arrival, but both Gieene and Doughaity are try' g harder
to clarify the administration's role for the community. “111*
tcrnally, people have been concerned with doing the best
job they can putting students at the ccntcr,”said stern, who
has worked at Gtinncll for ten years. “I think Houston and
Travis have a different way of talking about that and quite
frankly. wanting the rest ofthe campus to know what we do
over here. We aren’t thc caretakers of the student body, Wc
are tducators,"

Stiidsiit Affairs came out with a new mission statement
this scincstcr. Undcr Tom Crad). the former Vice President
for Student Affairs who left in januaiy 2008, there was no
official “mission statement," but simply a “philosophy."

Both ale still on the \vebsiu. with the “philosophy"
dating as far back as 2001. In the old philosophy, Student
Affaiis is a "complement" and an “effective support com-
munity" to “the college’s central educational mission." The
new mission statement is more active, saying that Student
Affairs “intentionally fostei[s] and proactively piomodcs]
student learning."

When discussing the differences in the new mission
statement, stern reiterated that she sees no large changes
between student Affairs undei Cindy and Dougharty, say—
ing “there are a hundred ways to explain the same thing...
This is a IIEW way to articulate what \ve'r: doing."

MOVING FORWARD

In some ways, the selcction'ofThomas Friedman as this
year's commencement speaker is particularly apt. While the
“ﬂattening" of the world described by Friedman may elide
the nuance of global political-economic shifts, it may help
encapsulate the dynamics ofStudent Affairs at Grinncll and
at schools across the United states. With improvements in
communication and technology, administrators from coast
to coast can exchange philosophies, while a network oftrade
gioups and professional associations spuis the proliferation
of“bcst practices."Thcse transformative pressures can work
to “ﬂatten" our student affairs at institutions throughout the
country, moving toward more professionalization and more
homogenization, ‘

Whether or not Dougharty's arrival will prove to be a
watershed moment in the campus’ culture is a question that
only history will be able to judge. But what is undoubtedly
true is that Grinnell, like any institution, will continually
change. Organizations must often adapt to changing condir
nuns and many of Grinnell's facets in other areas have been
willingly cast aside to make way for new ones, What once
was a shameful campus taboo—-using a cell phonc~is now
a mainstay in the daily lives of most Grinnell students'rhe
Forum, cowles and qiad are now relics of their former
selves and in their stead are a deluxe new computer lab and
decked out apartments, while across campus rises the sleek
steel and glass ofthe new East Campus residences.

Organizations continuously grow and change, often for
the better. Many of the policy changes that fall under the
umbrella of "professionaliaationLthat RLCs know their
residents' names, for instance—should probably have been
in placc long ago,What's impoitaiit is that in reshaping its
self, the body be careful not to lose itselfin the process.This
is a time for introspection, for Grinnellians to contemplate
how they want to define themselves and their community.
