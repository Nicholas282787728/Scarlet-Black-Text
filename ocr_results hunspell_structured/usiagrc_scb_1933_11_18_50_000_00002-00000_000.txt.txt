AS OTHERS SEE US

All work alld no play . . . yes we all know the
‘old adage, but it doesn’t apply to Grinnell college
this weekend. No, it is anything but dull oil tllc
old calnpiis, and the match that set off the fire-
works was the gridiron banquet last night.

A little fun is good for the best of students.
and faculty members too, according to the theory
of tile Sponsors of the banquet. The good hilmored
l'aillcl'y of the Skits and stunts helped to take dome
of the ponlposity oiit of college life, and piit all on
all equal footing for a time at least.

Well placed satire, while sometimes having the
effect of “knocking a little frosting from the
cake". '3 often coilducive to clearing up a situation
and bringing about good feeling on both sides. .\
good laugh is the cure for many an ailment.

CLASS GRIEVANCES

The influence of the press in creating class
antagonism ill the United States was the subject
of an outburst of criticism by Secretary of Age
rieulture Wallace ii a speech delivered before a
group of college off ials in Chicago Monday. H'
criticism was prompted by an editorial from a
Chicago newspaper titled “The Cities Pay the Re
covcry Bills.” For a long time, he declared, the
newspapers of the country have been aligning
class against class, emphasLiilg points of conflict
and contrasting- class interests. it is not because
this tendency is any more deplorable now than it
has been for a number of years that Secretal
\Vallace was brought to score the newspapers on
this count. biit because cooperation between class
es is more vitally necessary to the welfare of the
nation now than it has been ill the last seventy
years. Unless the farmers and the lli'llallites, the
laborers alld the industrial leaders unite in the
effort for national recovery, the return to nation-
al prosperity will be prolonged if not made impose
siblc. ‘

Instead of encouraging and leading the pur-
suit of class cooperation, the tendency of the
press has been to further antagonize conflicting
classes. emphasizing grievances and publicizing ill-
justices iintil clans cllnlity has been cnflamcd. lllr
stead of acting as a llledial'y between conto.‘ ing
groups and pointing out the advantages of unselr
fish. united activity, the press has apparently ell-
deavored to “make news” by encouraging the con-
tinuation of inter-class antagonism.

Much can be done by the country’s newspapers
to assure the ultimate success of the national re-
covery program if they see fit to change to the role
of intermediary between opposing social and eco-
nomic factions. The aims of all (:1. uses, especially
at the present, are identical, and they must be made

REFORM IN DEBATING

Debating in our collcces today seems to be
little less than lllclltnl jiigglury Each side of the
debated question is not built riled primal" y with
presenting the truth, but ill hiding it when it is
profitable to do so. The host dollatcr is he, who, by
verbal prestligititatioii and hypnosis, is able to her
wilder his opponents into helple llcss, and show
the judges what a clever chap he is.

This is good training for law, wllci'oili Ollt‘, is
obliged, ill order to cairn a livlillood, to defend
guilty and innocent alike. But ill a debate there is
no such compulsion. tllc argucrs being: free to be
wholly honest. halfelloncst, or deceptive.

It is not that debaters are lleccssa
scrupulous Ordinarily they are as virtuous as all)”
one else. It is rather the standard. the code of
debatin which obliges them to obscure true issues
and ar ive at halfrtruths.

What, then, should be the purpose of debate?
Primarily, it should not be individualistic. but

is the social duty of any pc,‘ on who sees the light

CROCODILE TEARS

(Daily O'Collegmn)

Texas Guinan, queen of the New York night clubs,
was burierl Sunday. Thousands of hysterical and weep-
ing women, few of whom even knew the deceased,
rushed the receiving vault and carried away every single
petal of all the floral offerings as souvenirs. It must
have been a disgusting spectacle. It was once a custom
in some countries to hire professional mourners to weep
over the bier of the departed loved one, and to follow
the coffin to the grave, weeping loudly and tearing
their clothing, The louder they wept the better pleased‘
the family of the deceased became. We have done away
with professional mourners in America, but let a stage

are willing to perform. Sunday's episode certainly
showed little respect to the lamented Guinan. The most
impressive funerals we have ever witnessed were quiet
and dignified, with no crocodile tears in evidence.

When Julia Marlowe's distinguished husband suc—
cumbed some weeks ago, she asked that the rates be‘
private, and the last appearance of that beloved figure
was a dignified affair. The wife wanted to avoid any
thing like the Roman Carnival held over the remains
of Texas Guinau.

PERSONAL VIE\VS OF THE NEWS

(By J. E. Libivrcnco—Lincoln Sunday Journal and star),

Youth, and the fathers and mothers alike should
appreciate the inspiring lines which furnish the theme
for the new prooessional written expressly for the Great
Cathedral choir of the Westminster Presbyterian church
of Lincoln. The words are the work of Richard Steiner
son of Dr. Edward A, Steiner, who occupies the chair
of applied Christianity at Crinnell college, They were
set to music by John Rosbol'ough, director of the choir,
and were song for the first time last Sunday when thel
entire Steiner family was present in Lincoln for the
services.

These are the lines of the processional:

“Hail the throng of Christian youth,
Eager for the fray;

Searching life to find the Truth,

Beyond the light of day.

Speed them, speed them toward the goal,
Life is none too long,

For man to magnify his soul

And make of it a song.

Hail the man, and hail the maid

Seeking for God’s truth.

Men of darkness are afraid

0f fearlessness of youth.

Speed them, Speed them toward the goal,
Praise them more than blame;

They seek the truth and seek it whole

In the Master's name

Bless the champions of the right,
Man of God begin
The long awaited, ruthless fight
Against the sins we sin.
Speed us, speed us toward the goal.
And overcome all wrong,
The world must magnify its soul
And make of it a Song.”
The chorus to the first and last stanzas is as {017

lows:
“Mark our banners flying free,
Banners without swords,
Hear us sing thy jubilee
In majestic chords.“

That epitomizes, better than anything that has been
written in recent years. the spirit, the real spirit. of
misunderstood and maligned youth of today . . , Youth
itself has asked only for understanding. It has no apol»
ogies to offer. It is a trifle cynical over the sham and
pretense, which too many of its elders unconsciously re-
veal. It offers no excuse for its candor, for its habits
of speaking plainly and bluntly, and at times seemingly
disrespectfully and irreverently. In the world in which
it lives, there does not seem to be either the time or the
opportunity for soft speech , . . .

Many of the old superstitions have vanished. Much
that was born of prejudice has been wiped out. There is
added emphasis, when scientific progress is recalled, in
the old statement that it is knowerlge which makes men
free. These youngsters of today have to be far more
fearless, far more honest with their conscience and their
soul than their mothers and their fathers. They have
placed before them so much more of the inalterable
facts concerning life that greater courage is required
They have imagination, the inquisitive mind, which
seeks truth for truth‘s sake rather than to shun it be»
can: it may be unpleasant.

And yet, in spite of the search for truth, they re-
main dreamersidreaming of a happier world, a world
freed from poverty and misery, a world filled with hap-
py, selﬂreliant, and contented people. They dream of
nations living in peace, respecting the rights and the
liberties of weaker peoples, and concentrating their of-
forts upon improving and elevating the conditions and
the standards under which humanity seeks to exist.
They dream of a world in which justice shall prevail, in
which social progress shall kindle the spark in every
breast, in which the ideal of wholesome living prevails.
They are an unusual and a much misunderstood genera-
tion—these youngsters of today . . . .

Thursday
“Every college generation has faced
its own particular crisis," said Rich-
arrl Steiner, instructor in applied
Christianity, addressing the student
body.

“The student faces the crisis anrl‘
either conquers or is conquered by it.
It is the hope‘of the faculty that stil-
dents will leave college with enough
vision to conquer.

“It. is not grades or credits or facts
accumulated that will give you
Strength,” went on Mr. Steiner. “It
is the spirit that lies underneath."

Seeing the world as a living organs
ism with a social organization of in,
finite possibilities, Mr. Steiner point-
ed out that man has yet to demon-
strate the ability to become master
over his owli being.

"Keeping in mind the true mean-
ing of religion will help us to live
up to the highest idealism of which
man is capable," he concluded.

Friday

“Toccata Fugue" by Bach was the
selection played an the organ by
Prof. H, W.‘Matii1clf at the chapel
service F1 ay. In a brief introduc-
tion by President John s. Nollen, the
caprice of the composer Bach as illus-
trated by this selection was likened
to modern nursery rhymes.

On Other Hills

Al. the University of Alabama a
student is allowed 16 absences pe)‘
semester, distributed among his val”
ions courses, without incurring pro-
bdtlon.

Free tutors are being provided for
men at Northwestern university. The
system places one tutor in each open
house and fraternity. Ho receives his
board and room for the work.

A plan is underway at Louisiana
State university for the formation ofl
more local fraternities on the campusl
This will allow 40 per cent of the'
male students to become affiliated:
instead of the 20 per cent now her

Application of Socialistic Principles

Will End Crisis,

English Lecturer Blames

Faulty Distribution

for Situation

Faulty distribution is the cause of
our present economic crisis, accord-
ing to Fred Henderson of Norwich,
England, a member of the British
Labor party, who spoke in Herrick
chapel Thursday night on “Economics
of a World of Plenty.”

Charging that “one hundred million
men cannot earn a living under our
present lunatic system," Henderson
advocated the sooialistic principles of
government ownership and operation
of industry, and abolition of private
property rights, as the remedy.

Changes in Production

Because principles of distribution
of the products of labor have not
changed to correspond to changes in
production brought about by the in-
dustrial revolution, the working
masses must go without the necessi-
ties of life in an age of overproduc-
tion, Henderson asserted.

“While modern production provrdes
more goods with less effort than ever
before,” he continued, “the working
masses have no right to consume ex-
cept by providing labor which is not
needed.” ’

Plea for Better Relations

Leisure and abundance would be
the result of a change to socialistie
methods of distribution, Henderson
concluded.

A plea, for better relations between
English-speaking nations was made
by Harvey Ingham, of the Des Moines
Register and Tribune, following a
rlinner in Mr. Henderson’s honor in
the quadrangle dlnlng room Thursday
evening. Mrs. John S. Nollen, presi-
dent of the local Jesse Macy chapter
