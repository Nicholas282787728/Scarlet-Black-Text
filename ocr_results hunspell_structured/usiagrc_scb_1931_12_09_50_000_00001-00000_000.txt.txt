Shaw’s Drama
of Democracy
Wins Applause

Irwin Carries King’s Role
to Brilliant Peak
in Comedy

Brilliant satire, which served to
sweep the audience with laughter at
times, alternated with more subtle
shafts which called for throaty chucks
les of appreciation as features of "The
Apple Cart,n presented last night in
the high school auditorium under the
auspices of the Grinnell chapter of
the National Collegiate Players.

Cutting lines by Bernard Shaw
held riveted attention of onlookers
throughout, while the comedy was ad-
mirably portrayed by the original
cast which gave the presentation
here.

Irwiu leads Cast

Leading that cast was Boyd Irwin
in the part of Magnus, the king of
England, His facial cxpression serv-
ed to heighten the comic effect and he
carried the almost dual role of king
and diplomat to a brilliant peak. His
voice was well adapted to his part in
carrying many of the more ironical
lines of the play.

“The Apple Cart" is laid 50 ycars
in the future, King Magnus defeating
an attempt by the prime minister to
deprive him of the right to use either
speeches or the press to influence
public opinion.

American Shown

In brief, the king wins when he
threatens to abdicate the throne and
run for parliament. The prime min-
ister, seeing his position threatened,
is forced to abandon his course.

The comedy has been accused by
some critics of being pointless.
Whether such is the case or not, it
is certainly a satire on democracy,
and America comes in for its share
of the ridicule. Even the most loyal
citizens of the United states must
.chuckle when Henry Hall, as Mr.
Vanhattan, the American ambassa-
dor, announces the decision of the
united States to join the British Ems
pire, with true Rotarian enthusiasm,
senatorial pomp, and American con-
fidence.

Minister Wise

Second only to the work of Mr.
Irwin himself was that of Chappel
Dossett in the role of Proteus, the
prime minister. Here again the act-
or’s voice was an aid in handling the
part, as it rose with his anger, and
grew morc mellow as he tried to
smooth the cabinet into agreement,

Although the victim of the plot,
the prime minister is one who real-
izes his position and who admits that
he is prime minister because he is
good for nothing else. His tantrums,
when he alternately threatens to re-
sign h‘s post, and ﬂies into rage over
opposition on the cabinet, provide a
great deal of the comic element in
the production. '

Fusier Labor Delegate

To Norman Fusier, who portrayed
Boanerges, president of the board of
trade, a labor representative on the
cabinet, goes credit for an efficient
bit of entertainment. He was typic-
ally the labor man, unversed in court,
uncouth in statements, tactless in
opinions. King Magnus demonstrates
on him best of all his subtle art of
handling individual cabinet members
through flattery.

Women have a comparatively small
part in the play, Lysistrata, power-
mistressegeneral, handled by Florence
Hart and Amanda, postrmiStTeSSr
general, being takcn by Ncllic Strong.

to Speak Here
Thursday Night

‘Approach to Emotions’ Title
of Talk by Psychologist

From University

Christian A. Ruckmick of the de—
partment of psychology at the Uni-
versity of Iowa, will givc a graduate
college research lecture on "An Ex-
perimental Approach to the Emo-
tions” in Herrick chapel at s p. in.
Thursday.

'He spoke at Luther college Mon-
day, University of Dubuque Tuesday,
and Iowa State Teachers college his
day, His lectures are illustrated with
slides.

Responses Photographed

The address will be a semi-popular
presentation of research methods that
have been applied to the analysis of
emotions-aroused in a variety of silt—
uations.

Mr. Ruckmick has studied for more
than 10 years introspectively and
by means of registration of bodily
processes such emotions as fear, angr
er, surprise, and pleasant responses
aroused by music. Bodily responses
have been photographed by means of
an apparatus devised under his di—
rection.

Movie Reactions studied

He has also studied, under a grant
from the Payne Foundation. the emo-
tional reactions of children and adults
when viewing motion pictures. This
study is nearing completion in a
theater in the laboratory as well as
in theaters in neighboring cities,

The introduction to the lecture will
serve to summarize the important
contributions from other laboratories,
together with a brief history of the
beginnings of experimental psycholr
ogy and the address will conclude
with a discussion of the role of emo—
tions in every day life.

House Chairmen Investigate
Liquor Situation in Grinnell

The council of house chairmen in—
augurated an investigation of cam-
pus conditions in regard to the use
of liquor at a. meeting Monday night.
Lack of suficient evidence made ac-
tion by the council impossible at that
time and furthering of the probe will
remain temporarily in the hands of
individual buildings of the men’s
dormitories.

Lack of action on the part of
building officials will lead to placing
the investigation in the hands of col-
lege admi istrative
present drive to prevent use of liquor
in Grinnell will not be limited to men
living in dormitories but will extend
throughout the entire student body
here.

Late Starting
Valley Teams

Ha‘rd Trip to Put Aggies

in Shape for Race,
Here Thursday

“Bring on your Trojans” is the cry
at Creighton university in Omaha to-
day as the Bluejays prepare to in-
augurate the 1931732 basketball sea-
son for Missouri Valley conference
teams by tackling the University of
Southern California quintet at Omaha
tonight.

The Oklahoma Aggies will also be
listed among the early starters of the
loop, leaving stillwater yesterday for
a loaday invasion of Iowa, South Da-
kota, and Minnesota.

Aggies Herc Tomorrow

Meanwhile Grinnell's first game is
not scheduled until Dec. 13, that being
a non-conference contest with Drakc
university at Des Moines. Consequent-
ly, coach John c. Truesdale has not
rounded his aggregation into any
semblance of a definite lineup, ab
though fans may see the Pioneers in
a real practice workout Thursday
night when the Oklahoma Aggies
have scheduled a stopover hero to
take the floor for a few minutes
against the Crinnell outfit. The Ag~
gies play their first scheduled game
against State Teachers Friday night.

Although Coach Truesdale has four
veterans on the floor in Duncan, for-
ward; Edman, center, and McCreary
and Ullrich, guards, he will have
some big gaps to fill through the loss
of Douglas, Ruff, and Humphrey.

Waite, Frye, Good

Waite and Frye, forwards with the
ycarlings last season. have been show-
ing some classy work at the forward
position, and either one may bc pair—
ed with Duncan, although Wolfe, re-
serve of last season, has been hitting
the hoop with regularity.

Rowe. who also served among the
reserves last season, is pushing hard
for a center position, and christoffer-
sen may move up to one of the guard
positions. mlrich may be transferred
to forward. a position he played part
of last season, if Coach Truesdale
finds that he fits the combination bet-
ter there.

Bociter Handicapped

Coach William G. Doelter at Drake
is handicapped in his early season
workouts by the absence of two of
his cage lettcrmen. Kokjobn and Bow-
ers, who are with the Bulldog grid-
ders on their way to Hawaii. A pair
of sophomore basketball prospects,
Brechler and Wieland, are also with
the football outfit.

For the present. coach Boelter is
forced to center his quintet around
Everett (Germany) Schultz, two-let-
ter center, whose six-feet-four inches
make him almost certain of that po»
sition. The other Drake veteran on
hand is Don (Goose) King, who is
only a sophomore, having won his
letter during the second semester of
last year.

James Sets Pace

Sebastian is subbing for Schultz at
center temporarily, although he will
probably be replaced by smith who
became eligible at midyear, Abram,
Xanders, Ross, Golden, and Jenks are
handling guard positions alternately,
while Olson, Winters, Agard, and
Wright, are working with King at
the forwards,

Coach Harold (Puny) James, trying
to build a new team at Oklahoma A.
& M. during his first season aS bas-
ketball coach, is sending his men
through a pounding pacc early in the
season to round them into shape for
the Missouri Valley pennant quest,

The Aggies play Iowa State Teach~
crs Friday, University of Minnesota
Saturday, Carleton college Monday,
South Dakota Aggies Tuesday, and
South Dakota univcrsitjv Wednesday.

Couch James has a pair of veteran
