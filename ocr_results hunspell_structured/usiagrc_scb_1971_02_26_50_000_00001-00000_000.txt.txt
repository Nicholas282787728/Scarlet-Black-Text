“I hope not to disgrace the
cause of Truth" v James
Magee

The Faculty meeting of this
Monday was, by the large, a
lecture, introduced by Presi-
dent Leggett and delivered by
Professor Magee (James,
poli. sci.). The subjectathand
was Academic restructuring
and reform.

In his introductory address,

President Leggett reviewed
the problems attendant on re*
structuring the decision~ mak-
ing offices and procedures
here on the farm. Most of
Magee‘s speech was concern-
ed with the establishment of
such reform as imerative.
Somewhere, somehow, the
decision is made where to
spend money and where not
to, which courses will be giv-
en and which won't, what Stu-
dents will be allowed or en-
couraged to do, who will be
hired, and who will be dis—
continued. Problem is, in very
few of these matters is there
sufficient established, legie

Folk Speaks On Environment

by Bill Knecht

This year’s Rosenfield Lec—
tures hosted Prof. Richard
Falk, Albert G. Milbank Fro-
fessor of International Law
at Princeton. The lectures
spoke to international envire
onmental problems and to the
causes and possible solutions
of the Middle East Crisis.

An informal discussion was
held Tuesday morning in the
South Lounge on the topic of
the environmental crisis and
international efforts in this
field. Falk expressed "pes-
simism" about this situation,
to use his own words.

Basically, he explained, the
problem is one of conflicting
self—interests. Right now,
competition between industr
rialized nations is such that
pollution control is an un-
profitable venture which re
duces profit margins. Accort
ding to the dictates of free
enterprise, at this moment it
makes economic sense topolt
lute.

Falk feels that the nature of
the problem being what it is,
that is the destruction of in-
ternational air and water re-
sources, that only an inter”
national solution would be ef-
fective. However, he points
out that international control
of anything is directly opposed
to the concept of the Sover-
eign Nation—State, classically
the predominant form of in-
ternational authority, In es-
sence, States claim the ex?
elusive right toauthoritywith»
in their own borders. In a

Co-op Deadline

The deadline for applying to
live in one of the four co-op
houses for next year will be
March 8. The Housing Com-
mittee will base their selt
ection on suchfactorsas com-
patibility of the people invol-
ved, feasibility of any prog-
ram that may be planned, and
ability of the group to fill the
coop. Random selection pro-
cedures may be used.

Each member of the coop
will be required to signa con-
tract with the college now be-
ing drawn up by RalphPomere

be finalized by next week.

sense, international control
of pollution would involve
meddling with the internal af-
fairs of nation‘slates. Falk
feels that to realistically ex-
pect such things to happen is
self-delusory. As long asnate
ions are sovereign, we are
going to have pollution. Andin
the foreseeable future,nations
are going toremainsovereign.
In other words, the problem
is basiailly unsolvable.

As an inadequate but more
realistic approach, he feels
that it is going to be neces-
sary for the developednations
to take individual unilateral
action. This collides directly
with the profit motive of indusc
trialists, but is more feasible
since it works within the bore
ders of each nation state,
where legislationand enforce-
ment are possible. Leaders
are already talking about the
problem, and he feels that the
solutions lie in "getting poli-
tical leaders to believe their
own rhetoric."

Underneath it all, Falk
shares the apocalyptic belief
diat it will take an eco-dis~
aster of immense proportions
before people will be moved
to act in unity and numbers
sufficient to effect a solution
of the problem. As long as
the problem remains someone
else's it is easy togloss over.
This is an element of human
nature and he sees no reason
why it should change in this
case.

Falk turned to brighter topics
in his first lecture: Backgr-

on the subject matter.

Falk’s pessimism about the
environment eXtends to his
appreciation of the Middle
East situation. Noting thatboth
immigrant Jews and displaced
Arab refugees have legitimate
moral and historical rights to
Palestine and the Holy Land,
he sees the conflict as one so
deep as to be irresolvable. In
a very real sense, the struggle

tration. In some, notably per-
sonnel and advancement mar
ters, there is the semblance
of a regular procedure. Some
of the College's affairs, for
instance fund~raising and me
maintainance of the Physlml
Plant are "in the hands of
experts" (like Dale Hawn).
Some relatively new prob
lems, like budget trimming,
are in the process of evolving
an advisory and decision-ma-
king apparatus all their own.

Most of thebacking’andsflll‘
ing problems facing thefaculty
are purely (guess what)aca*
demic. Legally, all power and
ultimate power in decislon-
making at the Farm is in the
hands of the Trustees, and is
delegated through the office
of the President. Legally, the
faculty has power to propose
and advise, and the students
have none at all.

Ideally, such a republican
system of delegated legiti-
macy and limited suffrage is
best suited to a community
such as is ours, which is too
large and diverse to function
as a commune. Such deleg-
tion from level to level should
promote sound and responsive
organization, the ultilization
of all available expertise for
the solution of such problems
as arise, and a free flow of
information at and betweenall
levels. It should, especially
in an educational community,
serve as a means of encour-
aging selftedumtion through
public service and mutual ed-
ucation through cooperation in
that service.

It goes without saying that
such is not the caseyhere and
now. Instead of flowing freely
from level to level, informa-
tion and the legitimacy of po-
wer have pooled andstagnated
at every level: “modest sub-
stantive changes" are all that
one can hope to gain approval
now by both FacultyandTrus-
tees. It was thus withsome en-

Shelley Floyd
SGA Candidate

Shelley Floyd, junior house
president in Loose, is the only
official mndidate for the SGA
presidential election to be
Monday in the lunch lines.

Jon Stein filed a petition be-
fore the Tuesday afternoon
deadline, but withdrew his
mndidacy Wednesday morn-
ing. No other petitions were
received by the student coor»
dinator's office.

Rumors of write-in candi-
dates were numerous, but no
word of a serious campaign
had reached the 5&8 by press
time.

Shelley, a native of Tulsa,
Okla., has served on the stu*
dent-faculty Housing Commit-
tee, the Fund Subcommittee
of AWS/CofHP and the mathe*
matics department's Educa-
tional Policy Commit-ee. This
is the first year she has been
active in student politics, wha
ich she sees as a plus, since
she has been able to look at
student government as most
see it--from the outside.

Policy Committee Reclassifies Independents

The newly-approved Subs
committee on Educational Po»
licy is already in full opera-
tion, having had its second
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
The group, approved on an
experimental basis by the
faculty, is a full subcommite
tee of the Executive Council
and contains five students. It
is the first formal represen-
mtion of students at that high
level of academic decision*
making.

The five students are Andy
Loewi, SGA president; Mark
Ashcraft, science division re-
presentative; Nancy Graham,
humanities; Janet Sachs, soc-
ial studies, and Greg Beck-
man, at-large (appointed by
the Senate).

The first decisions made by
the new subcommittee were to
reclassify and to propose new
limits for independents. Ithas
been ruled that all decisions
of the subcommittee must go
to the Executive Council for
final approval until the trus-
tees change the college by»
laws.

Independents have been re-
classified in several ways.
Group and individual inde-
pendents have been split into
the categories of special
topics and independent study;
200- and SOUAIEVel independ-
ents have been differentiated,
and divisional and department
tal offerings have been dif-
ferentiated. In addition, there
may be loo-level practice or
workshops for one or two cre-
dits and 4UU-level advanced
seminars for groups ofjuniors

and seniors.

Prerequisite for ZOO-level
independents and special top-
ics is only a freshman tutor-
ial or sophomore standing.
300~level independents and
special topics require previ-
ous work in the department
and the consent ofthe instruc-
tor. Departmental offerings

must be approved by the den

partment chairman and the
Dean of the College; divis~
ional offerings also require
approval ofthe DivisionalEPC
chairman.

subcommittee was a lZ-credit
