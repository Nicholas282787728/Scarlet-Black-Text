From the intern's point of View, what are
the pros and cons of an internship? Four
Grinnell students say their experiences
have ranged ironi extremely valuable to
disappointing.

Kristina Scott did an internship in Bonn.
West Germany, iii the Fall of 1986, working
in Parliament She wrote policy sums
maries and press releases and worked on
the candidate's re-electlon campaign.
mostly doing research lor the Christian
Democratic Party. or CDU.

Scott believes that in Bonn she "learned
more about German politics” than she
"ever learned in the classroom." saying
that the practical learning experience is
“not on the same level" as the classroom
experience. She noted the satisfaction of
seeing the effects of her efforts "in more
than just a letter grade "

"Internships relate Grinnell with the
real world so that experience proves
very. very valuable," Scott said "They
are more relevant to life after Grinnell
than classroom learning...Employers
want to hire people who have proved that
they are capable of adapting to a work en-
vironment. Our education is to prepare us
for life alter Grinnell. and internships
serve that purpose better than any course
altered." She said She ieels "very strongly
about that." adding that the graduate
schools to which she has applied have all
asked tor related work experience.

He thinks that this experience will be

academics. Alex feels that it's “totally
worthwhile to give up a class {or
something like this."

As positive an experience as most inc
ternships tend to be. dilliculties do arise.
One example oi a problematic situation ocr
curred with Elizabeth Verslen. who work-
ed for a semester in Madison with United
Refugee Servtces at Wisconsin versten's
primary problem occurred With her work
supervisor. who “was totally unr
cooperative and didn't want me. He sug
gested I work at home and not at the [ins
ternship] site. due to lack of space in the
office! The whole time. I felt like I was so
unwanted," she said,

She said that he was hesitant about giv-
ing her responsibility and very disorganiz-
ed and indecisive about the work that she
should undertake.

Because oi the varous problems.
Versien was able to change her lntei‘shlp
site. She began working three days a week
Ell the Wisconsin St te Health Reiugee
Program She said. They were really
glad to have me. ..un' the iirst day. they
put me to work.”

 

“The stuff I’m doing out there could just as easily
be assigned by a prof here, ” sayx senior Alex

Dracobly.

 

Especially useiul to Scott was the oppor-
tunity to apply the writing skills she learns
ed at Grinnell [0 her work ill Bonn. She
said that seeing parliament sessions was
an education in itself

Scott. a senior. noted the importance 0!

Not only is Alex receiving valuable
criticism on his writing techniques. but the
research methods he uses are very diir
ierenl from any used in the classroom The
writing style IS also very diflerent than
that used to write papers. and Alex noted
that he had to changc his writing style to
suit the ditierent purpose

Although he incorporates completely dil-
iei-ent techniques than iliosc used at Grin
