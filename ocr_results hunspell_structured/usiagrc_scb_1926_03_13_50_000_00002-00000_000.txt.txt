The case of the Nebraska alumnnus vwho recently
bewailed to his Alma Mater and to the country at large,
that his school had not taught him how to cope with the
practical problems or lite, brings up a question; inst what
is a bachelor's degree worth?

One bright writer has very car-etuily ﬁgured out that
a bachelor’s degree is worth 20 cents and with great
mathematical precision has deduced that 1,000 or the same
are worth 2200.

UMWNORED, UNSUXG

One or our contemporaries makes a good point.

last of each semester the woods become full Df the lads‘
who mine to college to (li Ingnisll themselves, out: gath-
arms the rewards of their labors.

The honorary societies seek them out and ribbon
them: the campus paper keeps a cut of their manly VisA
ages near the top of the tiling cabinet; every important,
committee appointed to carry out this and carry out that
includes their names among the list or members, iuid
they get their pictures in the annual among the "Repre-
sentative Studenls.”

The point is that it Would be El. grand idea to pick,
out a low or the "Least Representative Men” and hand
them some bouquets.

Men should come to college not distinguish them»
selves, but to ilevelOp themselves. Select a. few of those
who do the least good for their college and the most

To the Editor:

May I have the privilege oi correct-
ing an unfortunate phrase in the edi-
torial “Long Chapel Education" which
tppeared in your issue of March Lil in
advocating a restriction of long
chapels the writer stated “It might
cause some embarrassment to inspired
alumni who desire to impart. messages
,to the students ct today - - » ,” which
alumni
are rather eager to evangelize those
who prsently will join their number. 1

No Grinnell graduate, as {or as I
know, has ever intimated a willingness
to speak at chapel. In [act it is all

 

'the other way. When the alumnus re~

turns to his Alma Mater he is rust of
all a son at Old Grinnell. That is all‘
the recognition he craves, and the only‘ ,
distinction he desires He does not‘
feel inspired to impart messages to‘

'llle students or todayihe is too busy

1
trying to link the Grlrlhell of today}
with the Grinneil or which he was a}
part. 1

Except by special invitation oi the
tucnlty when national holidays have‘
been observed, no Grinuell sraduatei
has delivered a long chapel addressl
this year, nor within the recollection ot‘
the present generation of students, nor
