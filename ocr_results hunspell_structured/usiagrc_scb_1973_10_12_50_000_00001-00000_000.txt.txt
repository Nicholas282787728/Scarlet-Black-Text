by Jessica openhcim
and Rob Rainer

Sir Herbert Marchant gave a lecs
ture on the situation in the Middle
East in South Lounge Wednesday at
7:30. After the lecture he led and
refereed a lively discussion about
lsrael, the Palestinian reiugees,
and Big Power interests. '

Sir Herbert is one of 60 Senior
Woodrow Wilson fellows who visit
campuses tor a week or more as
visiting proiessors. Marchant, who
has served both the academic and
the intelligence communities 0! Erie
tain, was also ambassador to Cuba
and Tunisia.

Noting that the U.s. government
played a big part in the creation
of the Jewish State and in its cons
tinumg support, Sir Herbert demone
strated how the existence 0! Israel
affects American citizens. He men»
tioned that the US, government has
given $1.2 billion in aid during re
cent years and that we could be
heading for a clash with the Soviet
Union over the present situation.
The exeambassador pointed out that
the Arabnlewish conflict is of relas
tively recent originfﬂe stated that
the roots oi the problem lay in
Britains ambivalent position during
World War I.

The British tried to get both the
Arabs and the Jews on their side
by promising them independence
and a national home. But by open—
ing Palestine to heavy Jewish tin»
migration, the Arabs were made to

UFW: Boycott On

CHICAGO, ILr-Rumors that theU~
nited Farm Workers union boycott
on non-union lettuce and grapes has
been called off are false, according
to Nathan Schumacher of the UFW
Midwest Regional Office.

Schumacher said 'Wednesday in an
interview that a proposed agreer
menl between the Ul-‘w and the
Teamsters Union had not yet been
signed, and that completing details
or an agreement "may take some
time.” ,

Schumacher added that the boycott
had been called against growers,
not against the Teamsters Union,
and that any agreement with the
Teamsters would not necessarily

_ affect the boycott.

Local boycott organizers said Wede
nesday that they are in close touch
with the national UFW organization,
and that any change in the boycott
program will be immediately come
municated to the Campus Commu»
nity.

nations

As the competition for the land
oi Palestine began causing blood-
shed, the British threw the ques—
tion into the hands of the U.N.
Under American pressure, the U.N
opted ior partition oi Palestine, gin
ing the best land to Israel.

This led to the outbreak oi the
1948 war in which Israel thorough-
ly defeated the Arabs and increased
its allocated territory by one third.
It also led to the Creation of'750,000
Palestinian refugees,

Eight years later another war brr
oke out over the Egyptian nationr
alization of the Suez Canal. Alths
Dugh lsraeli forces occupied the
Sinai, with the aid of Britain and
France, they soon withdrew under
American pressure for a negotla-
ted settlement,

Tensions did not disappear but
increased and led to the Six Day
War in 1967. This was a brilliant
military victory ior Israel and led
to the expansion or its territory
With the additions of the Golan Heir
ghts,‘ the West Bank, of Jordan,
and the Sinai Penninsula,

This war also led to a modern
Diaspora of Palestinians with l,
259,000'reiugees and 1,000,000 lin
ing under ioreign occupation, The
U.N. was at an impasse as the
Israelis retused to withdraw and
neither side was willing to under-7
take serious negotiations.

Marchant then asked students to
play the role of judges oi the World
Court and hear the evidencetor each
Side, He then presented the casetor
both the Zionists and the Arabs.
The results were a hung jury and lett
the audience with a proiound sym-
pathy tor Henry Kissinger and others
trying to negotiate a settlement.

The night beiore, the visiting Bri-
tisher had spoken to a south Lounge
audience about his experiences
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

neer at KDICVFM will be open

He was serving as British ambaSSs
ador to Cuba at this time and was
involved in the negotiations with the
Revolutionary Government oi Cuba.

sir Herbert spoke of Fidel Castro
as a man ofgreat charismaand some
eccentricity. He statedthat the Cuban
leader had done nothing successful
since the missile crisis. Atthe same
time he gave the Cuban government
credit ior vastly improving living
conditions, ,

one oi Marchahts main points was
that ii Kennedy had not appeared so
hesitant on the Bay at Pigs that
Kruschev and Castro would not have
dared place the missile on Cuba.
Considering president Kennedy’s
conduct throughout the weeks of the
crisis, Sir Herbert said that he had
“only the greatest admiration iorthe
way in which he handled the situas
tion.”

Sir Herbert gave glimpses oi what
went on behind the scenes. Accord-
‘ing to Marchant, Castro continued
to create a storm alter the world
thought the missile crisis was over.
Castro threatened to reiuse toallow
the missiles to leave as he had not
been consulted.

Marcbant ielt that he could not
saiely surmise on the iuture, say-
ing that “Castro is remarkably n.
rmty in the saddle.” A brief ques
tion and answer period with theaud—
ience tollowed the do minutespeech.

Vandalism caused a minimum or
$725 on campus in the early morn—
ing hours Sunday, according to Phy-
sical Plant ofticials.

Watchmen report 'ten separate in-
cidents between the hours of mid—
night and 8 am. Sunday

According to Assistant Dean oi
Student Allairs Hob Jacobs, the das

Vandalism: Damage Totals $725

Several registration signs and
parking signs were stolen or des-
troyed. Total damage in these inci-
dents is estimated at $175.

Three hymnals from Herrick Cha-
pel were removed and found on the
ground outside Gates Hall, and tops
of soap dispensers in a Main Hall
restroom were stolen. Damage ﬁg
ures are not available in either
incident,

Disturbing

However, the incident that most
disturbed College officials involves
no monetary loss

Hawn reports that steel pipes were
placed across the north—south railr
road tracks which run through the
Campus in a way that could have
caused a train to derail.

' Watchmen removed the two pipes,
described as about 4 feet long and
about 271/2 inches in diameter,
betore any damage was caused.

Hawn says the pipes were across
the tracks at an angle and braced
against the ground beside the tracks,

"Somebody is very sick in the
head, to have done that,” Hawn said.

He added that the danger of such
an action, both in terms or injury
to individuals and damage to both
railroad and college property is
enormous.

Hawn said the Chicago and North-
western Railway, which owns the
tracks, had not been notified of the
incident “because there isn't enough
iniormation to do them any good."-

President Glenn Leggett expressed
concern when told 01 the incident.

Security

Jacobs said Tuesday that members ‘
oi the campus security patrol were
on duty at the time Of the vandalism
incidents, but that members at the
patrol did not witness any oi the
acilons as they took place, although
two members did see one possible
suspect.

He expressed greatest concern o~
ver the railroad incident, although
he appeared worried by the volume
of vandalism.

Jacobs said a mayor problem con-
tronting those involved with campus
security is lack or student coopera-
tion
