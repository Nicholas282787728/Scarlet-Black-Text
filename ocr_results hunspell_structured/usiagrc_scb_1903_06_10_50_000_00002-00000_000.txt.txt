INTERVSOCIETY DEBATE.

chrestcmathiai—is Win rhe Third Debate
and Receive the Faculiy
Trophy.

The third inter-SOCIEL)‘ debilteof the
year was held In the chapel last Satur-
day evening, and again the Chresto
Inatllian society w * successful. The
time for the preparation or this coir
test was short, but nevertheless the
debate was an interesting one and “as
indicative Oleie good \lorl: [lie
cieties are doing. The question was.
"Resolved that the shill-age should be
taken away from the negro iii the
United States " The debaters were
J. J. IIeei‘en, C. C Chopin and ,\. L.
Barnard for the Chi‘csLeluathians, and
II. C. lVebeI, P. R Trig: ahrl E L.
Lee for Grinnell Institute, The
Judges were Senator . Smith or
Osage. and Hon. C. \V. Cr [er and 11011,
J. P. Lyman of Grinnell.

1. Lee opened the debate [or the
aillrlnative with an argument showing
that negro siilll’ﬂge liiid failed ef pur-
pose: it was expected that thes ulfi‘age
wonld improve the negro, but this
expectation has not been realized. The
ﬁfteenth amendment lnlllcbed a great
injustice upoi the south, deprived the
whites of poll ’cal power and placed
the negioes in conllict with the Whites.
This amendment was adoped hastily
and later developments have not justi-
Lied its passage.

Mr. Heeren opened the debate for
the negative With an interpretation of
thequestion, showing that the demand
was made for the disfranchisement of
all negrces, good and bad alike. He
argued that the question called for
action that is contrai Lo the principles
of law; that is unconstitutional; that
it would deprive the negro of equal
protection of the law, and hence would
be despotic and tyrannical.

Mr. Weber followed for the afﬁrma-
tive. With the aid of charts, care-
fully prepared, he showed chat the
negro is not ribbed for suffrage. His
first ohm-t, showed that from 52 per

comm 61. per cent of the negroes in ’

the south‘ are illiterate, and that in-
theentil‘e United Stmthe percent
age is 43, Furthermore. the negroes

negro is unlit. ior citizenship because
of his criminality and great immoral-
ity.

Mr. Chapin followed the negative
with an argument Showing that the
disfrancliisement of negroes would
Virtually establish the “divine right"
theory In the United States: that it
would be the greatest possible crime;
that it would increase Hie hatred be-
tueeli lllie races and add greatly to the
Viablem already C\ sting. He refuted
the argliliiem. oi the alhlhlllbive asto
Llie illiteracy 0f the negroes and
showed that we percentage of
illiterates was steadily decreasing.

in rigg neAL appealed for the are
lirlnat e and argued that the sufr
iragc had lailed or its purpose. It has
cxpectcdthal the sii ago would aid
the negro in his moral and industrial
development, and would be u pro
teciilon to the negro. In both respects
It has failed. Furthermore the negro
does not rippleciate his or age of the
ballot. :lfis vote is pilrehnsable and
is not used for his own improl'ement
and defense. The granting of the
franchise to the negro was an injustice
to both the negroes and the Whites.
What the negro needs nob politi l
powc buo moral growth and iii-
dustrinl development.

Mr. Barnard closed the debate for
the negative by showing that the
adoption of the proposed policy would
cause endless strife over the eligibility
of voters; that race hatred would be
prOmoLCd and that a \Oting aris-
tocmcy would be established. 1n-
stead of disfranelllsing the hegroes.
Llie sillliage Should be restricted, the
restriCLion applying to the \\llites as
hell as to the negioes. '

The reinLL’ﬂl speeches were given
in tliolollowing order- Mr. Cliapin,
Mr. Barnard, Mr. Ueeren for the
negative Mr. Lee, Mr. Trigg, llr.
“'eber [OI the aihl'matire, Mr.IIeercn
and Mr. Weber did especially fine
\\orl( ill rebuttal {is hell as in their
iii-st speeches.

The decision of the judges was un-
‘duimous for the negative.

THE PIPE OF PEACE

At seven o’clock Saturday evening
the Junior and Senior braves and
squaws met on their iormer babble
field, the dense forests north of the
big wigwams, and smoked the pipe of
peace and buried the hatchet.

The hostile warriors in war paint,
red blankets and feathers met at the
north end of the campus with piercing
yells and warlike demonstrations and
the pale faces ran for their lives, but
itwas only a mission of peace on
which they moo.

C. ECriley spoke iorblie Juniors
’He said that, they forgave the Seniors
for their victories and would always
have a pleasant remembrance of the
,many struggles with the Seniors.
