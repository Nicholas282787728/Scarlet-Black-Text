Any Man's Death — -

Grinnell’s a relatively peaceful place. We
crowd the bookstore in the mornillg, sit
and dlink cokes during the day, play hock~
ey before dinner. We study and go to
classes and enjoy our leisure and get ex»
cited when we hear our gtly is getting a
fllrlough. To be sure, the notes of the
bugle and‘the shouted commands bring res
minders that the world is at war, but for l
the most part the soldiers are little more 1
than an addition to our social life.

This is not France, Switzerland, or
India, where refugees who have been
forced to flee their own countries are make
ins.r untold sacrifices to continue their work ,
as students. In Switzerland, Spain, Aus~
tralia, and New Zealand, students are in-.
terned, but they are studying to equip
themselves for the future. Students are
prisoners of war in Germany, Japan, Can-‘
ada, India, even in the United States, and
they ask for books in an effort to fill the
emptiness left by war.

Grinnell is in the middle of Iowa, which
is in the middle of the United States. How-
ever, Grinnell students belong to the world
because the ideals of a liberal arts college
are World-“dole. These ideals are not shared
by our enemies, who fear freedom of
thought and speech. The propaganda lnae‘
chines of the axis have fought a war of
ideas no less potent because it happens,
not to be the truth. But the Chinese stu- '
dents, as Dr. Kotschnig pointed out, arei
Winning the war on the intellectual front.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

So is every student in any country who
respects the truth, reveres justice, consid-
ers man a valuable thing in himself.

John Donne said, “any man’s dcatlli
diminishes me, because I am involved in
Manhlnde.” When a Russian student cane
not study because he needs food or cloth
ing or books, the strength of the United
Nations is diminished. The World Student
Service Fund was organized to keep the
United Nations strong by providing money
for students. The fund is particularly der
serving of our support because ill a sense
we are giving the money to ourselves.
Small donations will scarcely be adequaten
twenty-five cents is a meager sum to payl
for the preservation of the liberal arts.
During the fall, much more will be said
about the World Student Service Fund,
before any money will be collected. Whelll
the money is collected, Grinnell hopes to
show its faith in the students of the world.

The Welcome Escape - -

In this odd year of a Grinllell sails men
students, sans transportation facilities, and
sans food a new sort of Homecoming
celebration in the form of Pioneer Days is
in the offing.

A lot of us have been thinking and
talking about the Homecoming of 1943
with nostalgic memories of the past. Any
celebration staged around the end of Oc-
tober and labeled Homecoming‘ would be a
farce. And yet to allow October and Injun
Summer to slip by as if unnoticed would
be incredible.

The possibilities of Pioneer Days are
unlimited. Spiritually, the event should
take our minds off the whole crazy situa
tion as described above. Materially, it
should be a heck of a lot of fun providing
opportunities for the discovery of hidden
talent, and one of the greatest opportun-
ities in the history of the college to pub-
licize this institution and the town of Grins
nell. Let other colleges lapse into a leth-
argy or try to carry on under false pre-
tenses. Some one in Grinnell has had a
brain storm.

Complete cooperation of faculty, admin»
istration, and students is needed to put
this, someone's brain storm, oye' That
shouldn’t be hard to get what with the
possibility of a nationally prominent figure
on campus.

Let's forget this is 1943 without a
Homecoming. Let’s pretend it’s 1890. Let’s
all be a part of the gang going through
”them swinging doors” on Pioneer Days!

OCTOBER [5.

OPEN FORUM

7T9 the Editor:

Any fainmiiided person who he
loves in ”Justice for all" should
:crtalnly have been as indignant
us I when 1 read in Monday’s
October 4 Des Moincs Register
the ioilowing account: "Toledo,
IowaﬁFor entering a farm house
where he stole a. loaf of bread
and n Jar of apricot preserves,
Woodrow Wilson Johnson. 29,
Sunday started serving o 207
year hard labor sentence at Ann-
mosa state reformatory."

There's no need to convince
anyone that the sentence impos-
ed by the District Judge B. F.
Thomas does not fit the crime.
If there are extenuating circumr
stances they have not been print-
ed

Therefore, I can only know that
Mr. Johnson has not been treated
fairly. How or why I do not
know. That's what I wish to find
out. and it something can be
done about itel for one would
like to see thet something is done
about it. Who's with me?
