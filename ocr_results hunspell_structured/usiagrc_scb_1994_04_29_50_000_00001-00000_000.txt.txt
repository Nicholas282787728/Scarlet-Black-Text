Engineer from Chicago—Northwestern discusses train safety

By Howard B. Horn

Ol-lN W. Smith,a representative

of ChicagoNorthwestem, the

train lha', goes through campus,
came to Grinnell on Tuesday to talk
to Dean of Students Tom Crady.

Smttlt is a representative of 0p
cration Lift: Saver, an organization
that promotes train safety, Although
the organization directs most of its
effons towards railroad crossingsaftey
programs, Smith’s talked to Cindy
about the two students recently ques-
tionixi by police for “jumping" the
train and about students’ general dis—
regard of train saftey.

There were four major violations
of train saftcy that Smith illustrated
Smith first explained the dangers of
train jumping. A person who jumps
the train might miss, possibly causing
serious injury. If a conductor sees
somebody jump the train, they are
required to stop. At 10 miles per hour,
the estimated speed atwhich the train

travels through campus, it takes at
least 1/4 of a mile for the train to stop.
Thisis notenough room for the train to
effectively prevent an injury. Also,
the force of the train stopping can
throw a train jumper off,

The second danger Smith dis-
cussed was students trying to beat the
train. Trains appear to be traveling
more slowly than they actually are.
This gives people the impression that
they have more Lime to beat the rain
than they actually do. Since the train
cannot stop quickly, students should
uscdisciction whencrossing the tracks.
“Trains can'tstopi It's up to people to
yield to the train," Smith said.

Another danger discussed by
Smitltis whenstudeanputcoins,cans,
etc on the tracks. “Putting a coin on
the track puts you in unnecessary danr
ger,”Smiihcxpltunod. Railroad tracks
are not designed for people to walk on,
There are many “tripping hazards," or
spots thatcan cause a person to trip on
tracks. In addition, a person can get
their foot caught somewhere on the

tracks, leaving him or her vulnerable
when a train comes,

Finally, Smith addressed the dart-
ger of getting toclose to a train, Some
students will put themselves as close
as possible or lay down next to the
track when the train passes. Often.
things will hang off the train that can
strike people if they are too close.

Perhaps the most imponant point
that Smith made was that train acci-
dents have an impact on conductors,
too. “Engineersarehuman,too,"Smith
expressed. “We don’t want to see
anyonegethun. It'ssettseless.“ Smith

alsodescribed thefear thatgoes through
an engineer's mind when she or he
sees a person or car cross the track
when the train is approaching. The
engineer is helpless. All that she or he
can do is pray that the person or car
makes it across in time.

Train safety is especially important
