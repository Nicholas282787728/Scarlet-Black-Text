Quit glorifying Communism

It has become obvious in the last semester
[hilt Grinnell College h not adequately cone
fronted some of the po symbols that rep
resent mass—murder, repression, and the darkest
moments of 20th century humanity’s struggle
for hecdoni. And Tm afraid I do not speak of
thc swastika; I think our community continues
to harbor a healthy revulsion for that symbol
and all it represents. 1 am writing, instead, about
the symbols of communist totalitarianism—the
hammer and sickle, CCCP t-shirts or hockey
jerseys, Soviet flags. Mao's visage, and Che Guee
vara iconsiwcln for fashion and displayed
around campus by the inoie su-
perficial and callous mernbeis of
our Eonimuni .

From an academic perspco
live, the most egregious example
ofthis callousness was evidenr in February when
SOL hosted Spanish Professor Valerie Benoist,
who delivered a morally void and intellectually
shallow talk on Enicsto “Che" Guevara,

Whatever else Che may have been7 a revtie
lutionary, liberator of Cuba, a handsome face
juveniles to admin—h: was also a cold-hearted
murderer, who oversaw rhe hasty trials and ex,
ecutions of hundreds ofCuban prisoners during
his years at the La cabana Fortress prison. (Ape
parentiy due process was not a revolutionary ide—
al.) Armando M. Lago, who is currendy writing
a book on the Cuban revolution, claims to have
documented at least 156 executions under Che.
And most scholars seem to agree that Che overv
saw roughly 600 executions, bur some estimate
he ordered as many as several thousand execu-
tions, He was also said to have demonstrated an
unusual appetite for torture at La Cabana.

Moreover, Che's political ideas were crude,
at best, and stillcborn and deeply inhumane, at
worst. His conception of the “New Man” ime
plies that he might have committed the crimes
of Mao, Stalin, and Pol Pot had he not encounv
tercd resistance from Fidel Castro, who appar-
ently exhibited a significantly lower threshold for
violence.

To realize the “New Man,” Che demanded
the “very profound changes in rhe mentality ol'
the peopleindividualism as such, as the isolated
action ofa person alone in a social environment,
must disappear in Cuba. Individualism tomorrow
should be rhc piopcrutiheanon ofthewhole indi-
vidual, to the absolute benefit of the community."
What happens if the mentality of the people
resists? The “pioper utilization of the whole in
dividual" sounds torn rrorn the pages of 19m,
and what is the “absolute beneﬁt of the commUe
nity"?

In short, his ideas about inclividualjtyﬁm
ideal that many Grioiiellians rightlycherish—are
violent and antithetical to civil liberties and ba-
sic human rights. Indeed, he said, “Lenin, Stalin,
Mao-Tse-tung and the new Soviet arid Chinese
rulers, establishkd] a body of doctrine and, shall
we say. examples to follow." Doesn't it concern
any Grinnellians a little that Che's role models
were 20th»century murderers numero uno and
dos?

Furthermore, some argue that we can
separate the ideas of communism from the

failed implementation by the USSR, Chic
na, North Korea, and Cuba. But, they didn‘t
stray from the path; repression and mur-
der in the name of the ideal war the parh.
Unfortunately, Professor Benoisi was not con
cerned with historical cvidence,wrth Che's messy
history at La Cabana, or with political ideas.
Rather her talk revealed the frivolity of”cultuml
studics"whcn she chose to discuss Che’s iconic
slants in American pop culture, Her lecture pure
ported to cover some aspects of Che's life that
the audience might not have known, including
his nickname, his Argcn roots, his years as
a moth 1 student, and above
all else, the construction of
his identity by himselfand by
others. She did litdc to chal-
lenge his myth, however.

lfshe was, in fact. familiar with the details of
his political ideas, his bloody behavior in Cuba,
or the basic chronology of his life (she did not
know when he traveled to Africa) she made little
effort to share that knowledge with the audience.
Admittedly, she did confess that she is no Pchl’t
on Che,and that quicklybecarne obvious, though
it does not explain why she felt justiﬁed speaking
on him, or why SOL implicitly advertised her as
some sort of authority on the subject.

At the talkI asked Benoist about Che's quesc
tionable sympathies with totalitarianism, but she
brushed aside the question, saying she intended
to address it later in her talk (she didn‘t). Ben-
oist's irony at the end was thar people have pror-
ited from the sale of the icon of an anticcapitalisrr
It's ironic, to be sure, but Guevara’s ideals are not
worth emulating in rhe first place, so who cares if
people are making a buck offbo’zos who want to
use his visage as a fashion statement?

I think it’s ironic that a room ﬁlled with
people who, I’m guessing, would describe them
selves as human rights advocates would also
embrace Guevara literally at race-value without
questioning his role in Castro's revolutionThe
responsibility is not Benoisr's alone, however.
The leaders of SOL should be ashamed for
choosing ﬂiers that variously llonized Guevara
smiling with a scrappy bcard or playing baseball
(“What a roan of the people! He's one of us,
you seal").

The inrellecnial dishonesty surrounding
Guevara in this community is reprehensible, and
the unitonic advertisements by SOL and the
mlk by Benoist would have been better suited to
a two»bil propaganda pamphlet, or perhaps an
absurdist play.

Brit the talk on Che was, as I mentioned,
only the most egregious example ofcallousncss
toward communist symbols here.The prevalence
of Soviet reshirts and ﬂags, Che Guevara icons
and other similar symbols around campus reveals
a widespread and disturbing ignorance or indif
fereiice to 20th century history and those who
have suffered and died because of the failed ext
perimenrs of communism. ifwe do, therefore,
bebeve in human liberty and human rights, and
I hope we do, then we must recognize the whar
these symbols truly represented, and denounce
them as unequivocally as we have denounced
Nazism and the swastika
