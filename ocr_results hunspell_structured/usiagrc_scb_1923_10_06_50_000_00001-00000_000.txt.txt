and approved by the faculty and the
possibility of a fourth in the valley

which will keep them working almost
until snow flies.

Si. Paul on October 2a. This meet
will open the season and. with the
exception of the Valley meet, will
be the most important on the Pie-

Management Plans to Disk-ibute
Copies to Alumni Here
and Over State.

The big Homecoming issue at Mal-
teaser will break forth the day of the
big homecoming football game, Octa»
ber 27. A huge quantity or material
has been handed in by the student
body in response to the plea made by
the editor, Ensil B. Talbott, and the
coming issue will be the biggest that
has ever been published in the history
of.ths school.

Several hundred extra books will be
printed to sell to the alumni who will
be present at the game and several
hundred more will be distributed
throughout the state of Iowa to the
alumni who will be unable to come to
the game. More than twenty drawings
have been submitted and a shortage
of art work will not be present this
issue. Much talent has been unearthed
from the present freshman class.

If the books are completed in time
a window display will be held in one
of the local stores for two or three
days before the camel.

Four Men Help With
Yell Leading Today

As a result of the tryouts held by
the Honor G club during the past
week Larry King, '23. Roger Patton,
'25. Ralph Hall. '26, and West Stotts,
'27. were chosen as material for pros-
pective yell leaders. The tryouts
have been in the nature of active yell
lleadlng at the pep meetings held in
,the men's dining room.

These four men aid George
Johnson. varsity yell leader, in the
game this afternoon with Parsons. In
the near future two of the four
will be permanently appointed. This
arrangement for selecting yell leaders
is a new one and it is hoped that it
will stimulate more acnve interest a—
