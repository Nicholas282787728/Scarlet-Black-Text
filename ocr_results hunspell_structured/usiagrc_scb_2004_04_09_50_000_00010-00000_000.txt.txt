see a rarher ordinary sighr oia single actor
giving a monologue; however, rhe acror
will be playing rhc parr ora carror.

Schmidt will direct another on:»nc[

The acrors, Ross Km '06, chris

(who also happen to be rhree ofSchmidt’s

well ro rhe playwrighr’s unusual approach

"Westartcd a minurc by minure jour-

by Cid Standifer

For Rebecca Mauldin ‘05, direcring T/i: Oﬂr‘u was a second chance
ro rake a convenrional but Funny and roaching play and make ir int:t=ste
ing. While Mauldin was srudying or The Narional Thearer lnsrirnre, she
was given a clip ofa play ro direcr widn a similar focus on dialogue as 771:
oﬁrn Mauldin was disappoinrcd when rhc piece received poor reviews
from her peers and decided she wanred ro try again.

Mauldin said that working with the two actors has been one of the
mosr rewarding aspeers orrhe producrion. According ro Mauldin, she
chose Caitlin Skinner ‘07 and Qucnnn LaLond: ‘07 humus: she was
pleased with the way the two actresses interacted in their audition. “When
I give rhem new siruaiions ro see whar they’ll do wirh rhenr, rhey always

 

amaze me," she said.

Mauldin chose riie T/It oﬁireror her second chance because she felt
rhar mosr people could symparhire with rlre rwo unnamed characters,
“Having had an inrernship and doing misccllaneous laborious work ...i
could really idenriry wirh rhese women, nnd l rcel like a lor orsrudcnrs
could,” she said, The characrers in The once are trapped in a siruarion
mosr or us dread: being srnck doing pomtless iobs for rhe span oiour
careers. Mauldin reels a srrong draw ro rwo monologues rhar reveal iusr
how or shorr orrheir crpecrarions rhe women’s lives have fallen. Despire
rhe comedy in the play. Mauldin ﬁnds rhe ending poignanr. “I rhink in
life we rry ro ﬁnd rhings rhar will bring us happiness," she said, “and I
rhinksomerimes it’s insr really unsuccessrul."
