_ Pioneers victimized
gby perfect game
against Cornell

By Alex Severens

Much like the recent dreary
weather, the Grinnell women‘s softr
ball team has been unable to muster
much of a smile. The search for that
elusive ﬁrst victory continued this
week, with the victory remaining out

- of the clutches of the team.

The Grinnell College men’s ten<

ﬁghting to remain positive about at-
taining the mson goal ofindividual

LastTuesday,Luther, the top team
in the Iowa Conference, defeated the
Pioneers, 7-2. The match featured
the top-ranked Division III singles
player, the Norse‘s Sujay Lama.
Grinnell’s No. 1 Mark Reynolds

“played well to lose 6-1, 6‘1,” ac-
cording to Arseneault.

Highlights of the meet included
No.5 Sean Barry’s comeback win, 5.
7, 6-2, 62, and the No. 1 doubles
competition in which Luther came
out on top, 6-4. 4-6, 6-3. “As the
match wore on we became less in-
timidated," noted Arseneault.

Over the weekend. the neiters had
a tough time with Knox and an easy
victory overAurorar in the firstmatch
the host Siwash ﬁelded a muchrim-

proved lineup and racked up an 8-1
Win. Arseneault said that all the
matches were close enough to win
and he had praise for Reynolds and
Jeff Wooten atNo. 1 doubles in their
674, 672 victory.

A day later the Pioneers
outrnatched Aurora, winning all nine
contests in a disappointing day.

The week certainly did not get off
on the right foot. Due to faulty direcr
tions, the team arrived at Cornell's
field just minutes before their game
was scheduled to start. The offense
unfortunately never arrived at the
game as the Comcll pitcher threw a
perfect game shutting the Pioneers
completely down. 10-0.

By the second game. the learn was
playing better. Andrea Leonard
pitched the complete game and held
Cornell tojustsix runs. The Grinnell
bats did put the ball into play. but
musteredjust ﬁve hits inthe 6-1 loss.
The lone RBI in the game was awarded
to Amy Fon.

Coe came to town last Thursday,

to generate the necessary offense to
put a mark in the win column. The
Kohawks swept the doubleheader l l-

for the Pioneers in the ﬁrst game and
was also the offensive generator. She
hit the RBI double to knock in Amy

Logston was waved home from ﬁrst
base on Term Geiger's long double.
The outfielder rifled a perfect throw
to the plate, killing the Grinnell rally
at a cmcial time. Katie Sommer got
two of Grinnell’s ﬁve hits in the game,
and, along with Tami Geiger. was
one of the two Grinnell runs,

Both Cornell and Coe presented
the Pioneers with pitchers who could
controltheballsurpr'isinglywellr Said
Coach Lori Sadewater of the offene
sive game, “I think we were intimi-
dated at the plate initially, but even
after we found our confidence, their
defenses were so good that we could
not ﬁnd the holes"

Of the Grinnell pitching staff,
Sadewater said, "They are coming
around. We just have to accept that
our pitchers are not the type who are
going todominatea Ieam.That's why
we need our defense to play a better
game. They have to make the plays,
and recently they have not been there
to back our pitchers up."

The season is starting to wind
down, with only three more dates
remaining. After the loss against Coe,
Sadewater gave the team the week-
end off to collect themselves and to
prepare for upcoming gamesr
Sadewater expects the next games to
be those in which the team will have
its best opportunity to get that elusive
victoryr

Weather permitting, the team will
play at Monmouth tomorrow and
