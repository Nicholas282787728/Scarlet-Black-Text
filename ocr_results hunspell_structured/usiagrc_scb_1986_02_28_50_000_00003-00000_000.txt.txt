_ Since the first begetting occurred,
humans have been attempting to bridge
the grandest ot canyons e The Generation
Gap. Mortarboard’s Grandparenting pro
gram has set the foundation for Grinnell’s
link across the gap: one that spans six
blocks e and over so years. i

Working with residents of the Mayﬂower
Retirement Community, located approx»
imately six blocks south of the college on
Park Street, the program has initiated as
many as 25 relationships between
members of the two communities since is
origination last November.

According to Mortarboard member
Kathy Shuck, contacts have thus far been
established during social events organized
jointly by Mortarboard and Mayﬂower. At
these gatherings, students visit with each
potential ‘grandparent’ and pairings are
made on the basis oi geographical
background, similarity of interests, and
general compatibility.

However, Mayﬂower activities coor-
dinator Sharon Fleming encourages in-
terested students to arrange visits through
her. She may be reached at 236-6151.

Reasons cited for involvement revolve
around the mutually satisiying aspects of
shared companionship and knowledge.
Sharon Fleming reported that many oi the
residents are not visited on a regular
basis, it at all, and truly enjoy the oppor»
tunity to share their experiences.

Julie Cohen, a Grinnell freshman, joined
the program recently out of a “desire for a
‘dilierent' friend." Later, she reported

that she hadn't anticipated how much she
can learn from the experience.

Grinnellian Katy Stoff, who has adopted
2 grandaparents at the Mayﬂower, agrees.
“Obviously, they have lots of need for be
ing talked to, and in addition, they have
history that our generation should hold on
to," To emphasize this. she explained that
her ‘grandparents' were born in 1898 and
graduated from Carleton in 1918 * literal
bridges across time.

Mayﬂower resident Hazel Watt, Whose
adopted grandchild Jennifer Halcrow is in
Germany this semester, also expressed
hopes that, in addition to providing much-
welcome companionship, the students
could learn from their vlsits.

This wealﬂi of knowledge often includes
college history, as many Maytlower
residents have past ties with the college.
Mrs. Watt’s husband graduated from Grin-

, hell in 1514, and later returned to the com-

munity to work for, and eventually assume
ownership of, the Herald-Register. The
local newspaper is now operated by her
sonrln-law and daughter; three of her
grandchildren, also Grinnell graduates
have worked on the newspaper.

Participants and organizers alike hope
to see these connections with the college
broadened. Numerous Mayflower
residents already attend concerts,
recitals, and convocations, but many
others do not simply because oi lack of in
tormation as well as companionship. The
Grandparenting program may provide
solutions.

Humane Society.

by May-lee Cllai

This month the Grinnell Humane Society
was formed to combat the problem of
animal neglect,

This community group was coetounded
by seniors Sarah Fee and Sylvia Ward. Its
membership of 26 includes both college
students and area residents. ,

Ward said the group seeks to curtail the
ettects of “inherent cruelty in people's at»
titudes towards animals” that occurs on
and oil campus.

Fee also noted that before cat ownership
by, dorm reSidents was iorbidden. “ap
parently cat abandonment was sort of
rampant.” She recounted rumors reported
to her by students who stay over break of
“students who leave 'animals in locked
apartments over break."

Furthermore, they reported that there
seems to be problems with students simply
abandoning their animals at the end of the

semester in belief that the animals will be
able to “fend for themselves.”

If an abandoned animal is found, one
should not call the shelter but the police
who will then take the animal to the
shelter. The animal is men kept for a week
while ads are placed on KGRN and in the
paper in an attempt to place the animal in
a home. If no ,placement is tound, the
animal is then put to sleep via “painless”
injection.

Last year. some 53 dogs and 10 cats were
put to sleep

Ward views this as “an approachable
problem. It’s sad but it can be worked
out,’This will be the major goal of the
Humane Society. ,

The group has already begun to sponsor
tundraising activities such as last Sunday,
February 23’s bake sale. Proceeds will be
used to publicize animals targeted for ex

Culturally

by Rachel Cashman

A panel ot seven Grinnell studenu
gathered Wednesday February 19th to
discuss their perceptions oi America dur-
ing the American Studies Symposium. The
students on the panel had either studied
abroad or came to the United States to
study. The Symposium allowed them to
draw various conclusions from their ex»
periences,

Joel Dubiner (’86) found it hard to sum
up the changes he had noticed in himselt
during his yearlong stay in Japan. He said
there was “a whole process or feelings that
you experience upon entering a toreign
culture.”

Dubiner came up with several dii»

-ierences betweeen America and Japan,

the first ofwhich was “space." “Japan has
very little space for a lot of people,” he
said.

He also found himself put in the often un-
comtorta ble role of being a celebrity Simp-
ly because he was an American.

Meghan Hays ('87) spoke of her ex
periences from spending a summer in
Nicaragua and a semester in Yugoslavia.
Through her Studies, she realized how rich
the American “middle class” is in respect
to the “middle class” of these other Coun-
tries. Because of the high Value of the
American dollar, her spending power was
increased to a degree which amazed the
“middle class” family she lived with.

She also noticed the different sense of
time which the Latin Arnericans had. They
placed less importance on the actual car~
rying out of a task and more on the sense of
accomplishment and the enjoyment which
they received trom completing it.

The spatial ditterence noted by Dubiner
was also noticed by Betsy Mathre ('86)
during her semester in London. Upon her
return to the U.S., she was amazed at how
big everything seemed — cars and
refrigerators for example.

”Americans think big,” she said.

She encountered frustration in her of
forts to explain to the Londoners the
various aspects of Amrrica. Europeans
gain their knowledge of America from the
television or movies. “Dallas” and
“Dynasty” portray the stereotype of rich
Americans and many with whom she had

Speaking

talked to had uaveled to Miami or New
York, Their image of Americans was that
they were loud and rich.

Chris McKeachi ('86) also traveled to
London but he focused on his revelations
through his experience in a runnng club. In

'England, running is club oriented and

more of a social function that it is in the
United States. '

McKeachi observed, “They get there,
run a couple of miles (without warming
up). take a shower, then join their friends
for a couple of beers,”

On the other side of the issue, Hamid
Amjadi (’88) was the first to speak from a
ioreigner's viewpoint about coming to
America. A native of lran, Amjadi noted
that before the revolution that started in
1978, the Middle East was very pro—
American. The Iranians, like many
others, gained their perceptions of
Americans from movies and television.
Many did not want to come to America
because of all of the violence Hlat they had
seen in the television crime shows of the
’70’s, such as “lronside.”

After the revolution, a strong anti-
American sentiment resulted from
American capitalistic endeavors and arm
sales.

Theo Eicher (’89) of West Germany,
spoke or how his political values had
Changed since coming to the United States.
Before his arrival, he had thought of
America as a “superpower” playing pro
tector of Western Europe He believed this
protection was necessary.

Eicher was very shocked to find that
although Americans projected an image of
great concern, in his opinion, they are very
apathetic and do not really care about
what is going on in the rest of the world.

Pauline Chui (’86) from Hong Kong. had
no definite ideal of an American before she
came, although she perceived them as be
ing very rich, wild, and wasteiul. She has
found that Americans are very indepen-
dent and place a great importance on in-
dividuality.

“In Hong Kong, everyone wants to be
considered ‘normal’. Here, it is almost an
insult to be like everyone else," Chui com-
merited.
