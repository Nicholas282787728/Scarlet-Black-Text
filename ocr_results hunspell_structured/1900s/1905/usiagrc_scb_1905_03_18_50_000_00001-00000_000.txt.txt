Peculiar Experience in the lawn-Minnesota

Debale. A Stabbing Aifray at Michi-

gan_——Minnesora Studenrs Amuse ..

An occurrence which is very rare in
debating history is that the result
should be a tie, This happened in
the recent debate between Minnesota
and Iowa held on liarcha at Iowa
City. ooeoitheiudgcs failed to ape
pear and the other two took opposite
sides on the question. The result or
the peculiar‘ circumstance is that the
debate in all probability, will beheld
again at some inture time. The sub-
rect was, Should Railway Freight
Rates in the United States be Fixed
by Constitutional Authority (Constir
tutionaiity not Considered). lcwa
supported tileNegative.

On March 5th in an attempt to cut
the hair or a ireshman at the Univer-
sltyof liichigan, two students were
stabbed and although their wounds
are not dangerous. they are conﬁned
to the hospital. After successful at.
tempts on two unsuspecting besides,
the six sophomores, engaged in the
work met more than their match in a
ﬁrst year student who reiused to sub
mit. Asa result, we of the Sopllor
mores were lacerated.

a great arousal of student feeling
over the mismanagement oi the in-
stitution is now holding sway over the
student body or Minnesota. It is the
privilege and even the duty or stu-
dents to manifest an active interest
in the control and discipline of their
school. in this instance the trouble
arises over the ill-management by the
present Board or Control or Minnesota,
which supplies all the necessary pur-
chases. The students base this claim
for the abolition of the Board on two
assumptions. .

1. The Board doe‘s not make pur-
chases.

2. It tries cheap goods.

The tact of this general feeling over
abuses may be justiﬁable. But what
is a still greater cause for ’oongratula—
tion is this apparent show or spirit
and determination among the patrons
ofaschool, to have some word its to
its general policy.

Proiessor Holden’s trip over the
Burlington lines in his seed-special
train has been marked with great
popularity and interest as shown by
the residents along the route. Many
hundreds listen to his lectures and
receive his specimen of seed daily,
Antes "extention Course" is proving
a decided success.

letic games in St. Louis under the

The second oia series oi class pl‘o-
grains, being giren in the institute
society, occur-red Wednesday evening.
The program was in charge or me
Sophomore class which proved con-
clusively its ability to entertain. The
curtain went up at 7:45 and revealed
about hiteen Sophomores in lull min-
strel attire. Messrs. Jaqua, Peck,
McBride and Haas proved themselves
highly proiicientascud men, the last
named especially makinga hit with
the audience. Their jokes and per»
sonal hits were well gotten up and
d . tributed. The quartette composed
or Peck, McCormick, Jaqua and Ly-
man accompanied by Gordon hen-y at
the piano inrnishcd a very enioyable
portionoftheevening’sentertainment.
reek, Lyman, and McCormick did
solo stunts antlerery number was re
ceivcd with hearty cal‘s for more.
Popular songs were served up by the
entire chorus. Readings were render
ed by Day Smith and Horse new. Mr.
Smith went through a rather ii hit
selection and his excellent execution

was appreciated by all.

Although the evening’s program
ivasatrille outer the ordinary tor a
literary society, nevertheless, it was
one in which a great amount or talent
was brought out and one in which a
large number could participate. The
smoothness with which the program
was conducted placed it above the
average attempt in this line.

The next program will be given by
the Freshmen and if the high stand-
ard that has been established, is lol-
lowed, a good and proﬁtable enter--

tainnlent is assured.

CHAPEL.

Yesterday morning in ehapelDoctor
W. A. Heidel read a paper upon a sub-
not which was new [0 the majority of
his hearers. It had to do WiLh the
ideals of Scholarship which now are
found in Grinnell and which have
been heretofore woven inw trhe atmos»
phere of Iowa College. It was a plea
tor philosophy ror philosophy’s sake
and an argument for the achievemenh
OI truth as a. life work.

His line or thought was brieﬂy as
follows: It is commonly said that

HUMEOLDT.

Last Wednesday evening the Iinru-
boldt society listened toa paper by
Mr. w. ill. Barr upon “Some Problems
or Hydro Economics.” Thistetrn is
applied to a-partioular ieature or the
scientiﬁc research carried on by the
Department or Interior and has to do
in general with the quality or the
water supply and its use in the manu—
ractiu-es in the country. Mr. Barr
described in detail three examples
of the kind or problems met with.
The ﬁrst be illustrated by his work
last summer upon Lake Champlain
where the paper pulp industry is care
ried on so extensively. Here the
problem was one or waste disposal and
consequent pollution or the water.
The second type of problem is the
state watersupply illustrated by Iowa,
where the question is largely one of
sewage disposal and water supply.
Tile last type or problem is that or
western irrigation where huge dams
are being erected for the purpose or

reclaiming large tracts of arid lands
costing into hundreds of millions of
dollars.
