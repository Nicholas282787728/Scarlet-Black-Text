GRINNELL 5~FEN N 5.

The Quakers area Strong Aggregation
and the Scarlet and Black Seen: only
in a Heart-R ding Finish.

The warriors of Mike Bergen iour.
neyed to Oskaioosa

there invaded the camp or the Quak-
ers. They expected the Friends to
treat them in a irieiidiy manner as is
the custom or the Quake . and they
were ratiier surprised when with only
ten minutes leit to play the score
board showed Penn 5, Grinllell 0. But
like the teams of old, of \VlllCll Cylin-
nell is so proud, the wearers or the
scarlet and black did not give up, but
took along breath and in the ne. six
minutes of the hardest football which
has been played this year, they reach-
ed Penn‘s ﬁve yard line by a series of
line smashes and a may yard run by
Bleamastei'.

In, the next two minutes with
Penn ﬁghting desperately and with a
mob of angry meters yelling like
demons, Grinnell pushed the ball over
although compelled to go to the Very
limit of downs. Bleamaster kicked a
difﬁcult. goal and the score stood Grin-
nell 6, Penn 5. The teams lined up
again but the whistle blew With the
bail in mid-ﬁeld and in Grinneil's pos-
session.

Penn scored the touch-down lin the
second half after twenty minutes of
play. The Quakers started a ﬁerce
attack on the Grinnell line and try as
they might the line of the scarlet and
black Gould not hold them. Only
once during the assault. did Bergen’s
boys take a brace and that was on the
two yard line. There the Quakers
were held for downs and Grinnell Sp.
cured the ball. Jaqua punted but
handicapped on account of the goal
posts and the nearness of the teams,
he made a poor kick and Penn secured
the ball again on the fifteen yard line.
Once again the Quakers began the'-
irresistible march through the Grin-
nell line and ﬁve minutes after crass-
ed the goal line. Sopher failed to
kick goal.

In the iii-st hair, Grinnell was penal-
iaed repeatedly and this [not alone
prevented the scarlet and black from
scoring. However, in Lire latter part
of the half, Grinncil was out played
and Penn had the ball on the 20 yard
line when time “as Called.

THE HAHN ORCHESTRA.

The Cincinnati Organiaaiion Opens Grln-
null Lecrur: Course Season Wilh
a Brilliam Concert

lseioi-e a typically rr
audience which lilled the Coiigrega

Ildlln Festival orchestra or Cincin-
nati, and soloists very successfully
opened the l, l u a leclure course
With a program or r ecir ed merit.

The oruhostrd, which possesses Lin
instrumentation or about thirty, pier
bontcd an admirable program and the
large audience thoroughly eiiioyed
every number though it was carelul
not to betray its enioyment by any—
thing approaching spontaneous ape
plause for (ear it might actually ap-
pear ior onceto grow enthusiastic.

The program throughout was thor-
oughly musicianly and completely
free from anything that bordered on
the bizarre or sensational. The or-
chestra was evidently composed of
musiciansof far more than ordinary
talent and the conductor, Mr. Hahn,
aleader of artistic instinct and |ln~
usual merit. “is reading of the score
was at all times satisfactory and one
could feel! that he would be master of
any baton he might welld.

The soloists were of morethau usual
concert-troupe merit. Mrs. Helen
Carter McConnell is acnntralto pus-
sessinga full. deep Voice which she
uses, for the most part, carefully and
well. though the tones of her lower
register were not always entirely
pleasing. They possessed an almost
masculine quality at times which may
be excused however on mount: of a
severeeold which has prevented her
appearance on some of the programs
this Week. That she should have
been allowed to make her ﬁrst appear-
ance beiorea Grinnell audience, es-
pecially when that appearance was so
prepossessingmithoun any recognition
was as discpnrteous as it was thought»
less. In thesinging of “The Quest”
by E Smith she was at her best, gin
ing it a most delightful rendition.

Miss Georgia Kol‘ber. pianist, scored
the triumph of the evening in Grieg‘s
tremendous Concerto in A. Minor,
which is so familiar to Grinnell music
lovers. In spite oi the handicaps of
a miserable accompaniment by the
orchestra. and a Smith and Nixon

lessor Mary, who was at one timea
student at Penn, was asked to deliver
the leading address. llis subject was
“William Penn” and we are indebted
to the Penn C/lrudi'ulc ior the briel
resume:

”William Penn lived during the
time when the adjustment was being
made between the religious and polit-
ical life or England, andas aboy drank,
in excess, or the Puritan spirit of the
period.

There were four elements in the
religious situation,7the Established
Church, the Dissenters, Catholics and
Quakers. Penn'sliie coincides with
beginning of Quakerism, the essential
peculiarities or which arise from the
emphasis given to the idea or the im-
mediate aud direct inﬂuence or the
Holy Spirit upon the minds of men.

Oliver Cromwell became a tolera-
ticnist rrorn policy —Penn from prin-
ciple. The early Friends bad advanced
views or Democracy, 'Erel‘y man’,
said Penn, ‘is a sort of little sovereign
to himself: They did not adopt a
pecuh' iorm oi dress, nor did tiiey
originate a peculiarity or speech.

Toward the Roman Catholics, lliey
entertained the most liberal thought
or the day. Penn was a friend or

and .llgcrncn Sydney the Republican.
