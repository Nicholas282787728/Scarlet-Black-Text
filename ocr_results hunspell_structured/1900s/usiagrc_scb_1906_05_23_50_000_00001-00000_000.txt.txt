urdﬂy afternoon [ind received a. white
wash to the tune or: to l). The gzi'ile
was one or the best that has been
played on the local grounds ior some
time and the quality of ball was
high class at all stages of the game.
Errors were few and did not come at
cl‘i it‘al times so thab the two scores
were earned. The COuLesb tlil‘Ouxi‘l'
out was a fine exhibition 0! [lie Dab
ionalgame and one thorougiliv ear

scorescame in the ﬁfth when with two
men 01m and with Klein on third and
Wilder 9|) Secnud. Fisher made El neat
single between second and short, send
ing both men home and winning the
game for Grinnell. Only once did
Ame; become dangerous and that was
in the eighth. Ames had a man on
51's: and second and only one manout.
For a time in looked serious, bub len~
nelllooka brace and the next two
men retired easily, and Ames’ chances
to win were gone.

Smithson was on the slab for the ID»
cals and the Mazeppa Soutlipau was
emotive at all times, notwithstand-
ing the {act [him he had pitched
Lhilteeu IUD: InnlillKS against Iowa
the day before. He served up an (15-

Aggies guessing continually, although

Striking out ten or Grinncll's men.
