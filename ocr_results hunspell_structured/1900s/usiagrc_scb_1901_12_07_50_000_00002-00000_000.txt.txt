UTofdeference to the wishes

and icelings oia gentleman

who has been one of Grinnell:s
most loyal and consistent supports
ers, SCARLET AND BLACK has hithr
erto refrained from expressing
through its columnsthe student re—
spect and appreciation or him and
his work. However, we now feel
that we owe it as a dtity to our con-
stituency tomake some note of his
present somewhat serious illness.
The absence of Mr. Chas. Rawr
son from the Drake football game
was noted and regretted by every
member of the team, and the in-
spiration to be gained trom his
presence and enthusiasm, which
has been ivith the team at nearly
every game this year, was greatly
missed. The student body joins
with the team in wishing for the
Complete and immediate recovery
of Mr. Ralvson from his recent
severe attack of rheumatism and
hope he may again be permitted
to resume his workin good health.

Y M. C. A. NOTES.

Those who attended the Y, M.
C. A. meeting Thursday night
had the privilege oi listening to
two very interesting talks. Pmr
tessor Parker had charge of the
meeting, but gave most of the
time to Rev. A, T. Reed, 3 Con-
gregational evangelist, ivho was
vtsltinghimThtIrsday. Although
Mr. Reed's talk was a short one
and perlectly inlcrrrial, it was full
ct good things, along a line very
much needed by the association.

Professor Parker followed, with
a ten remarks such as only he can
give.

At the business meeting, which
followed, four new members were

voted in, and a committee ap-
pointed to arrange for a general
reception to be given the toolbuli
boys, sometime next week. It is
the plan of the committee to pre-
pare for a good sticml occasion at
which the entire college may exc
pi-ess its appreciation of the wcilt
of the team.
