ltet ball team returned from a

Tlrey played their ﬁrst game on
Thursday evening with the strong
aggregation from the University
and were defeated by the large
score of 37 to 2. The “Gophers"
were champions at the United
States last year and bid fair to res
tain thehonoragaln this season.

Our iellows had not expected
to win but hoped to make a bee
ter showing than they did. They
were seriously handicapped how
ever on account of the ﬂoor being
waxed, which made it very slips
pery and not being accustomed
to it they were at a great disad-
vantage for swift playing, wilder
was injured in the ﬁrst part ottlre
game, and had to retire, Fillmore
taking his place.

On Friday evening they met
the local Y. M. C. A. team of
Minneapolis and were dcieatcd
attera close game by the small
score of it to 3. Tire game was
noticeable tor its fast and snappy
playingand the local team won
by good ltlck rather than by
superior playing.

They lost the third and
game of the series to the husky
tarmers oi the State Agricultural
School. Score, 24 7.

as tollow ”the game
was last and exciting and was
witnessed by an enthusiastic
crotrd. Better team work won
the game for the farm school.
The Iowa men played a strong
and snappy game but were new

center at the Grinnell team tirade

nice basket from the ﬁeld, the

some pretty work and stopped
many nice throws.”

socicty debate was held in In-
stitute Hall at their regular
meeting last Wednesday evening.
Quitea large audience oi menr
hers and visttois greeted the
efforts of the debaters with an in-
tcrest which could not fail to
urge them to their best etlorts.

The question at issue, “Resolve
ed that district judges should not
be elected by popular vote", was
well handled by the seven men
who participated and although
some of the arguments presented
lacked force and soundness and
might have been handled with
more sl- ill, yet ilreresults are very

‘gratrtying to the society.

Those speakers u ho supported
the afﬁrmative of the question
were Paul Ti'lgg, Earl Brundage,

DEBATING.

The new plan tor inter-society
debates. recently adopted by the
two men's societies, seems to be
fruitful ie., rlts already.
For )ears there has been an ei-

winners

having

i . . .
tort to arouse interest in debating.

brit the effort has been apparent-
ly futile till this ye' ‘. The plan
of three debates a year. one each
term, seems all eady to be arousing
interest. A friendly rivalry her

tween the societies is useltll itr

stimulating the members of each

to better work. Last week eight»

eon or twenty men took part

in preliminaries tor the win-

ter term debate, and this after ﬁve
of the
spealrers are out. the inter-collegi-

strotigest debaters and
ate team and the winner ofthc
oratorical contest. Itseems that
the way to arouse interest in de-

bating is to debate.
