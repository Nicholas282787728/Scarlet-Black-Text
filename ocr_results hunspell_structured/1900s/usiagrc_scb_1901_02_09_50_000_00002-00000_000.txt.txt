aoAiN the Glee Club and

Orchestra have given proot
ot their generosity by promising
the proceeds of the home concert
as a guarantee fund for the May
Festival, They realized the dif-
ﬁculty and also the beneﬁts of
such an undertaking as the May
Festival. This offer came entire~
1y unsolicited. Nor is this the
ﬁrst time that they have shown
their good spirit by giving such
aid astlrey could to other organs
izations, for it will be remember—
ed that they donated part at the
proceeds of last years trip to the
Athletic Union. It certainly
shows a generous spirit and one
has reason to teela pride in the
existence of such organizations,
{or this spirit of co-operation
alone can insure success in any
undertaking. The cause they
have chosen to support is a
worthy one, tor it will uflei- both
students and citizens a rare op
portunity. Such actions as these
must win the admiration of the
student body,

slllps during the past yCiH‘. Dure
ing the past few years, Oberlin has
received several gifts but never
such a sum hour a single man. it
is natural [or a college to expect,
and it has a certain right to ask
aid from its alumni and friends,
but \i/hen aeollege receives such
a generous gift from one who is in
no way connected ivitli the instir
tution and has only the motive of
helping the college. she has cerr
tainlyreasontobegrnteiul. There
is, oi course, still a large sum to
raise, but the trustees and friends
of the institution feel conﬁdent of
their ability to raise the necessary
amount. ~
