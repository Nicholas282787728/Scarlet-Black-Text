THE EDITOR'S FOREWORD.

The SCARLET AND Iii It]: begins today, (the thirteenth (lily OISelJLeillber)
Ils lllii‘Leelitll ierlr of existence. We are not superstitious but it rests with
the students largely as to uhetller Our belief in sign is to be shaken or not.
Tire paper wlls originally Ionnded as a student organiz. tiun, edited and con
trolled oystriden and with its subscribers largely students. but tunes hare
clulligcd to such an extent that one llall'olli‘ subscribers are leumiii. one fourth
advertisers and exchanges, and the remaining one Iouth students

Now this is ucoiidltloii nIaIl‘aiis which ought liotlo exist and union Ilie
present management with the student’s cooperation yr ill endeavor to remedy.
Lastlear S li‘eely one-fourth (ll Llle students enrolled were subscribers and
yet no paper is read more eagerly or more thoroughly than the Sear
BLACK. Obviously, the remaining three fourths read lhelr neighbor's paper.
\l'e ztdlnit that the paper has not illu‘il been managed In it business Wily. and
yet it will compare most. favorably with our exchanges. Itrvus surpassed by
no other paper in the state last year, in the quantity and quality or its news.

The point to be noticed is that the students do not support the paper
linnnelzllly in comparison to what. they do other Orgtmizations, and yet, We
believe no other student enterprise is OI more importance than the semi
weeirly paper.

The present management will do all ill its power to make the paper Inter»
esting. but unless rvereeeire the proper support hour the students, we will
not hesitate to suspend publication ltnd substitute a weekly or semi-monthly
journal. The alumni dull advertisers have alwzt s (lone their share: it now
rests With the students. A word to the Wise is sufﬁcient

A few words as to our poll '. The entire stall cannot be announced in this
issue on aeeount or several elranges, but we can assure you that it will be a
strong one. The merit system will be tried this year iii the Selection 0[ new
members and it competent stall is assured, All (lepaiunents Will be carefully
edited, and our aim will be to improve the general quality of the news.

Tire paper has not been enlarged this year. as are do not think that present
conditions will \rnlmut {I change. Olir aim. as before stated, will be to in}
prove the quality rather than Lohave quantity. The ﬁrst tin-cc editions will
be sent to all Lifter which only regulati- subsclibers will receive the paper.
Sample copies can be obtained at the information bureau, or (it the library.

“'2 also wish to announce that all copy for the paper must be in {he Helald.
ollice by ten o'clock on (lay OI publication or else itwill not be accepted. This

I‘ AND

rule is necesslry in order to insure an emly publication and will not be broken_

for any one.

In closing we wish to speak a word lor our advertisers. Tire business lirms
who are represented in this issue are the ones uho deserve the students
patronage. You will notice that these iirrus beiiere in advertising and that
they always lend their support to student projects. Tire others “out your
trade but they do not. believe in adrertisiug in student papers, and for that
reason students should use discretion in their trading. and patronize only
those stores whose names appear on these pages. Subscriptions should be
sentin at onee to the business manager-or elren to any member or the
stall.
