APPRECIATION 01v WORK

A Knowledge of the Bible Is An Im-
portant Asset to All Col.
lege Men.

By Fred Hair, '12,

Grinnell alumni and all those ll'llo'

participated in the recent enthusiasm
on the occasion of the Cornell game,
are pretty thoroughly convinced that
the “Griunell spirit" is alive again.
Even our rivals at Cornell are zissiir-
ed that the ancient enthusiasm is still
distinctly and incontrovertahiy on the
job—a. oneness ol’ spirit, pervading,
permeating, giving an indelinuhle
stamp to the lite of the men oi Grinr
hell, The football season has been
pulled out or the pure by it. The
shakeup is general and coliiplete.

Two hundred and tuel'lty of a pos
sible two hundred and seventy Grin.
nell men were enrolled for Bible study
last year. This year, a scant hundred
are In line. The reason [or the slump
is precisely the same as for the slump
in football; the student body has not
been stirred up to an acute appreciib
tion of the end. It is purposed to se-
cure in this crisis an equally exhilir.
sting infusion at the Grinnell spirit or
knnw‘the reason why.

it is unnecessary to devote much
space here to reasons ior Bible study.
The thinking Grinuellinn appreciates
its value. But the thinking Grlmiell.
ion has a lot or things to think about,
and the iigures show that ho is neg»
lecting a department which he needs,
and which needs l m. Strong men,
live men, men or brains and iorce and
power, have much to divert their ac.
tlvity, but no hour could be more (11'
rectly contributory to potent activity
than one devoted to thntinl study oi the
bible. Five ol the innumerable urgu

Audience.

The popular appeal oi band music
together with the wide reputation oi
Signor Victor as a conductor
oi iamous musical organizations, drew
a capacity house to ,the Colonial on
Thursday evening to hear the Royal
Venetian Band.

in some respects the concert was a
disappointment to the majority or the
audicncc. The program was poorly
chosen ior a musical renter such as
Gl'innell purports to be, and its execu-
tion was not characterized by the dell.
cacy and prcc' ion that Festival and
other concerts have schooled us to ex.
pect.

Three oi the numbers, however, were
chusen irom well known operas: “Wil-
liam Tell,” “Lucia," and “Il Trovatore."
These were executed with much bril-
liancy and fine climatic eilect, and
were well received

“Schubert's Serenade,” played as a
solo with band accompaniment, was
perhaps the most artistic number or
the program, The iirst and last num.
bers were rousing hand pieces suitable
ior iniormnl occasions, but were hard.
iy worthy oi llle important places on
a classical program such as we should -
have liked this one to have been.

Miss Lewis as soloist is not oi the
calibre oi the artists who appear on
the recital course during the musical
season; hence her ellorts must be
judged rather leuiently. Her voice
has little ‘contralto duality, and her
singing lacks eVpl‘esslon.

The numbers were without excep-
lion cntbu, 'istically received, and each
was iollowcd by an encore The letter
consisted mostly oi the popular music
oi the day, and added nothing to the
artistic merit oi the concert.
