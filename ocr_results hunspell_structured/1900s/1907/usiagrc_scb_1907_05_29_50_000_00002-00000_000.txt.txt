Examinallons (or Seniors.

ND Small amount of commotion has
been evident. among members or the
senior class the past week, the
irritating inﬂuence being the cou-
viction that semester examinations
were to be administered to intending
graduates. Investigarlion shows that
in some departments this is only too
true and a legitimate provost has been
oﬁered against this departure from
the usual custom.

The plan has always been to ex4
cuse seniors from college work the
last Week or school, chc Week when
semester exams. are in order. To
evade the senior right of missing
classes some examinatlions are to
be given this week, on the plea. that
all should ba treated aliker Exactly
so; all should be treated alike and the
present senior class should have one
samo‘rllznr that has been accorded

senior classes inthepastl. Exemption ‘

mil. ﬁnals is raken (or granted nl-
wnys‘und was chls year. The sudden
resolution to change the plan thls
time can resulc in no good. 1i work
has been noglacrsd iris coo late now
to compel irs being made up wirh any
advantage to the one who has failed
and one whole thing results in noth-
ing. nrarninrcious tor seniors are a
orsspass on precodenr, cars an unfair
advantage and are valueless co all.

Delpllic.IPl‘esldenr Bell’s box was
numbered 23 and some considered
this an evil Omen but not for Presl—
dant Bell; he translated It “‘skidoo"
for the rest.

Irrespective or who were one "DrIKi-
Dal” boosters. the men who won the
Sham meet on Saturday are contribu-
ting mightily to the movement just
now.
