debating not supported?” Not being
quite able to agree with your position
I should like to add, iII may, a little
further discussion 01the subject. You
seem to have left us in a. “slough of
despoud" from which We ought if pos-
sible to extricate Ourselves.

Your closing sentence seems to very
Well sum up the point or viow which
you have taken. This is your con-
clusion, "The value oi debating can
not be denied, but active support or it
must bu conﬁned to a comparative
few,” If this were the truth of the
matter of course We should be obliged
to submit to it, and let it puss; but
according to my experience and iudg~
merit it is not the whole truth» nor
even a. Very large part of the truth. In
my own four years of college experi-
ence no outside work commanded the
interests oi the entlre student body so
thoroughly as debating and other
literary work It is amatrer of com-
mon knowledge that in our sister in-
stitution in this state, Cornell, debat-
ing receives the united support of the
College community, equal to. ii not
above everything else. The audiences
which have usually greeted our de~
hating teams. at Des Moiues, at Morn-
lngside, at Penn, are 2. further testi»
mony to the iact that College com-
munities can show the. proper inter»
esciu this kind. of work. On two or
three notable occasions Grinnell has
also shown that she could become in
tensely interested in debating Thus
experience shows tllattllere is nothing
inherent, in the dehatn to preclude it
common interest in it an the part of
the Whole student hody

Your article further seems to 2155“ me
that the debate is something of such
a technical character that the student
or average intelligence can not pro.
perly beexpected to iind it lnterestirg
when he hears the argumentv present-
ed. This again does not seem to me to
be so. Ihave never yet heard a, Well
presented debate that was not in-
telligible in a large degree to any
average person It. is not often that
one can attend one of our public do
‘oates withoutgoing away feeling he
has learned something more about
the subject than he knew before; and
lsiu abetter State of mind both to
think upon the subject and give it
further study

Again, the fundamental nature of
the debate is a contest, a struggle, a
battle of brains Where past hard work
and ready wit are going to show in a
most conspicuous mouuor. A victory,
too, is going to he won. The declaia
tion or that victory sometimes may
not agree with the general judgment,
but that does not necessarily lessen
its power to produce interest and en
thusiasm. In the debate we have
nearly all the qualities of the football
game, for example, whloir should tend

to create interest and enthusiasm on

 

the part of the students; the only

radlcaldillerence being that the do-
hate is primarily ‘a. battle of brains
and the football game is mainly a
struggle of physical prowess. In a
secondary way also it. is or course true
that the debate is more of tho nature

but 1!; lies in the fact that We are giv-
ing a disproportionate amount of
time, money, and attention to things
of less consequencei I am interested
in all Sides of the work. but it seems
to 1:19 that Just noW our physical

 

of serious work Willie the football
game has a. large element or the
nature of play and mere sport i
hardly think any of us would like to
admit that this latter difference is
sunlcieut reason ior preferring the
athletic contest. 15 not what. we are
interested in after all largely a main upon intelinctual interests?
ter of choice? As an illustration of disproportion
Finally allow me to suggest that ill in emphasis allow me to call attention
does not seem to me that our diiﬁcul~
ty lies in the inherent. nature of the
debate, or other things in themselves.

work is demanding an unduoamount
oionr energy. If students give the
major proportion oi their time and
stre'lgth to rootball in the rail, basket
ball in the winter, baseball and track
athletics in the spring, what oppor-
