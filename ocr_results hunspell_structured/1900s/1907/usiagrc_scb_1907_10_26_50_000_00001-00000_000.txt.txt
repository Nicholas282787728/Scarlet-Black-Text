COLLEGE FIGHT LEFT
UNSETTLED.

The BaptisI srars cbnvenuon Assembled
at Grinnell Have Heaven Arguments
aver Their Susie Colleges.

The question of merging the two
colleges Des Moines College at Des
Molnes and Central University at
Polls, which was discussed by the

Baptist Convention last Thursday.
was allowed to go unsettled. Both

colleges are under the Baptist De-
nomination and the proposition has
been to merge the two schools into
one large State Baptist College. The
report of the committee favored the
union of the two schools into one to
be located at Pella, and the discussion
of this report was the business of
the convention. The entire after-
noon and evening was occupied in the
debate, but when the ballot was taken
at eleven o'clock the neccessary two
thirds majority was lacking by about
23 votes.

Central University was organized at
Pails. about 1853 under Baptist superr
vision; about 1880 Des Moines College
was organized under Baptist control,
as a result, the denomination has been
supporting two schools, neither one
of which has been able to do the work
which should be done because of lack
of adequate funds. For some time the
union of the two schools was agitated,
and this resulted last year in the
appointment of a Committee of seven
to consider the matter. This com»
mittee required each college to raise
$100,000 asa test or its right to exist.
Central University raised $150,000
while Des Moines College only raised
$50,000 but it made a very liberal
oder in that they proposed to turn all
mods and properties over to the de»
nomination if they should choose Des
Moines as the state institution. This
proposition, however. involved the
assumption of a slight annual deﬁcit
which the committee feared might
injure the benevolent and missionary
ohiects of the denomination. and hence
they reported to the convention that
Central University he made the State
Baptist Institution, and that Des
Moines College be altered certain
options as iollews:

1. To merge with Pella by realizing
what she could on the present invest-
ments and turning it over to Pella.

2. Divide her assets between the
two Baptist preparatory institutions
at Osage and Slic City.

3. Continue as an
college {or women.

4. Establish Baptist houses, for
the students (if the denomination, at
Ames, Iowa City and Cedar Falls.

In the debate upon these resolutions
matters waxed walm several times
and once became so heated that pray-
or was oll'ercd so mat the brethern

mocer and it was necessary for him

VARSITY VS con.

Fonrball in General—Reserves at

Montezuma.

The varsity squad into on the early
east-bound train this morning for
Cedar Rapids where they are to play
the great Coe bunch this afternoon.
There were sixteen men in the squad
and everyone is in the pink or condi-
tion and capable or putting up aggood
light,

One has caused Grinnell a great deal
of trouble in past years by their plucky
defense and even defeated us last
year in a close game. It is that de-
feat the team is determined to wlpe
out today and nothing short 01a good
sized score Will satisfy them. Noth-
ing has been heard from the Co:
camp or any importance since they
were defeated so badly by Drake last
Saturday but: too much emphasis
should not be placed on that score as
asundoubtedly went into the game
over conﬁdent. The silence of the
last week surely indicate that Grin-
nell will meet a thoroughly prepared
team and a team ready to light such
as Bryant has a habit of turning out.

This week has been an especially
satisfactory one from aGrinnell stand-
point. Not only has several men de-
serted the cripple squad for the Var»
sity squad but there has been a. Spirit
and a desire to Work which contrasts
Very favorably with that of last week.
Flanagan who has been troubled with
asprained ankle and Campbell who
has been nursing a bad knee have
both been out and will play in the
game today. Rice who showed up so
well early in the season but cracked
his collar bone will also made the trip
as well. Wells all old West High Cap~
tain who has been out for the ﬁrst
time this week and has been playing
weilr

The team will line up today about
as follows:

is, Flanagan: lt, Hartson; 1g, Pierce;
c, Sparks; rg, Campbell; rt, Mcllrath;
re, McCarty; lib, Marshall; lh, Bair;
rh, Bleamaster; ib, Ziegler.

Turner and Bruudage did not make
the trip today but will be out for
practice Monday, having almost re-
coveredirnm the trichina and their
presence will materially strengthen
the team {or the hard game against
Drake next Saturday. With such
material at his disposal Coach Hamil—
ton will undoubtedly develop a team
which will give 3. good account of Mr
sell at Drake and all that is needed is
the support or the students Iroin the
bleachers at Des Moines.

The Reserves left this morning on
the “Cannonball" for Montezuma
where they meet the High School of
that place this afternoon. The
”Scrubs” have been turning out well
all season, due largely to the excellent
support which they have received
fromrhe management, and are able
to put a strong team in the ﬁeld this

aiternoon. The lineup will be sub.
stantially, as in other games,

TROPHY CASE.

All Cups Soon To B: in Place-Stale
Meer Cup Here.

With the installation 01 the Stahe
Meet Cup this week the trophy cm
in the library reading room has hegul
to assumea more prosperous aspect
and with the three new class cups
which are to be put in place thls
week will prese'lta verv pleasing ap-
pearance and will glve the present
day student a more accurate idea of
Grinnell’s athletic glory in the pail;
and of its present athletic acti iriy.

There are at present. or will be
when the three new clips are placed
in position some eighteen Cups and
banners, or the banners, perhaps the
most interesting is the W I. A. A.
championship banner Whlnh Grinnell
won in 18in and which is an excellent
piece or work. There are also banners
for the one half mile relay in 1901, the
half milerolay in 1905 and the mile
relay in 1906, which were won by Grin-
nell at the state meets in those vears.

At the present time there are cups
for almost all interclass contests.
Among these are the Somers’ Basket
ball cup presented four years ago.
The Don Foster Duel Meet cup for
the annual undermiase ﬁeld meet and
the H. L. Beyer’s Tennis cup present-
ed two yearsago, which have been in
the case some time In addition there
will be added this week the H P.
Procter cup presented last spring for
inter-class baseball, an elegant little
Cup with the body done in romauized
copper with the base and trimminKS
oI goldaud silver, the cross-wuntry
cupand the Home Field meet trophy
which latter two are offered: bvlhe
Athletic Union, and which are not
on'y beautliul but will add to the
interest in these events.

A mong the old cups in the case are
the Marsh Home Meet cup which was
permanently won by the class or 1895.
The Proctor Home Meet cup was last
won by idol). acup won by a. Grinnell
team at a Stale meet or the Iowa
L. A Vii. in 1391 and an old Cup of the
I. J. A. A. which was won permanent
ly byGrlnnell several years ago but
which sinks into insigniﬁgauce beside
the present cup.

It is in the State meet Cup that the
interest at present is centered. This
cup comes LoGlilinell this year for the
ﬁrst time in several years and is fully
worthy of the interest. It is it magni-
ﬁcent cup perhaps three feetin height
and ﬁfteen inches in diameter at its
greatest Width. It is or an excellent
quality Oi silver and isdeccl‘ated only
with the monogl'mll of the association
on the base and several athletic ﬁgures
on the cup proper. It is an excellent
aﬂﬂtion to the trophy c -e and the
Scarlet and Black would most that
pains be taken to make it a pill-man.

teams anrl altllrzligh little progress
has been made toward collecting them
they will some day be an interesting
feature, Iowa College has reason to

 

be proud of her excellent trophy case
