DEEATES ARE Too DULL.

Dan F, Bradley Writes in Prove This
Fact by showing Lack oi ”Form”.

“Prexy Dan" usually knows how to
get at things aiirl in the following
letter goes straight to the heart of the
matter.

Editors SCARLET AXD BLACK:

Your serial on debates has greatly
interested me and having had more or
less to do with them as a participant,
a listener and a. judge for twentyrﬁve
years, I may be pardoned for “butting
in.”

I attribute a lack of public interest
in debates to their (lllllllﬂo‘o. This may
seem harsh. But having salt as judge
recently through nine tedious speeches
in one debate and nine more or less
tedious speeches in another, I wonder
that anybody goes to hear debates for
any other reason than for school loyal-
ty and pride. But real interest can-
not. be built upon such a foundation.
Hereabouis, the dullness is due to the
rules, No rhetorical art or linish is
allowed to count with the judges.
Only the “argument is to be weighed.
Wliatis better suited to put a pre
mium cu dullness? It makes u do-
hate about as juicy as a geometrical
demonstration. It has come to be the
fashion to deride/oi m in public speak-
ing in schools. What rhetorical arts
Cicero. Demosthenes, Saronamlu.
Beecher, Webster or clioate would
legitimately use, the wise men

Colleges nO‘W call “hot air". And then -

it is wondered Why the public does not
pay olty cents to hear this mongrel
thing called the ”debaw”. The pub—
lic preiers to yawn and snore at home.
of course, we areln a period or re-
action iron the old time spread-eagle
“oratory”. But we have gone too far
in our colleges and hiﬂh school in this
reaction. People will come to hear
good speaking. They are not averse
to paying well Ior the privilege or
listening to wit and reason and
beautllulsettirg of Words, to quick
reparlee, and apt illustration and up
propr’lale allusion. Change the rules
so thatilie lodges allow [my per cent
lor llle mm or argument ard Iiity per
centicr the pure rellorm of it, and
there Vlill be a change in Lhe pullllc
interest and suppolt of debates

Neither Will any “lilur‘u/iwlll/ I'llcllls”
be lost.. Form constilnles hall the
charm ol'Lhe classical Writings. Isaiah,
St. Paul, the MasLer himsellowe much
to the beauty and poetical ﬁnish of
Lllelr splendid words. “Words filly
spoken are like apples of gold ill
platters of silver”. I predict that,
when Mr. SpailllllhE’S plans for publlc
speaking bear their legitimate iruir
you will raise up some men and women
in Iowa College who will be heard
withdelight not only lol‘ the trulll
they utter, but [or the In? WiLh which
they utter that truth.

Cordially,
DAN F, BloIrlLLtl',
