CARLET AND BLACK of

Jan. 12 contained an
tended account ofthe plans on
foot for carrying out the May
Festlvdl. it is the biggest thing
ol the kind‘ever attempted in
Grinnell. and Prof. Cole is sparing
no effort to make it a complete
success Indeed, it will be a sucr
cess so far as Prof. Cole's part in
the plan is concernedfof this,
Grinnell people ought not to need
a reminder ailer several year's ace
quaintance with past musical SlICr
cesues accomplished through his
instrumentality. It will be a suce
cess also from the standpoint of
the performers; for the past
record of the Chicago symphony
Orchestra and of Madame Car»
tone will beartlic closest scrutiny,
They are not in the habit of disc
'appointing their audiences. But
an orchestra of so pieces and a
\votldefitmous pianist cannot be
secured for a mere trifle. Plans
caiiictl out on such an extensive
scale require ﬁnancial support,
and lhc third element necessary,
therefore, is the unstintetl patrons
age oi all Grinnell people. If
the pctple witnt this most ex-
ceptional opportunity to matetie
a ,iliey niustoive their support
to il, Furthcrnioie, the ﬁnancial
risk oi this undertaking requires
that this support be promised in

advance. Abundant opportunity
will be offered for the people to
express their tvishes. The city
will be canvassed by a number of
gentlemen, anyone ot whom will
be preparcd to answer any ques-
tions concerning the Festival. A
subscription paper will also be
lett at Alley's Pharmacy, which
tlte students especially are asked
to remember, as they might be
overlooked by the canvasscrs.
That liberal support is hoped tor,
need not be repeated. The‘price
of tickets may strike some’ as
being extravagant, but when the
quality and size of thc Festival is
considered, the price is surprising
Iy moderate. Remember all
these things when you are inter-
viewed.

sires to call special atten-

tion to the Intersociety Debate
which takes place in the Chapel
this evening, For several years
our position in debating has not
been an enviable one, and the
reasons assigned tor this loss of
prestage have been mainly lack
of system and lack ct interest.
This year atter considerable
trouble and delay a very desir-
able debate with VVashburn has
been secured, and as the prelime
inary debate this evening is ar—
ranged under a new and colnpre»
hensive system, it only remains to
be seen whether the interest will
be sufﬁcient to make the debate
the success it should be. This is
the only debate that will be held
in Grinnell this year, and as the

question is a popular and interest-
ing one, the debate will be well
worth attending. It is the duty
of every student to be present,
and by his loyal support give the
debating spririt such an impetus
that it Will be actively felt in the
ﬁnal debate next April.
