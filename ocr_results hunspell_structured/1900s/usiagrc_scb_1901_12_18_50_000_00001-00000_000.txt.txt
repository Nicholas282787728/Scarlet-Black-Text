INTER—SOCIETY DEBATE.

chrestomathians Win a Sweeping Vic-
tory Over GnnnelllnstituteiA
Strong Team chosen.

Much interest was shown by the
student body in the Chresto»In»
stitute debate of Saturday even-
ing. the chapel being well ﬁlled
by an appreciative audience. As
is well known, this annual setsto
between the societies accomplish
es a double purpose; it gives the
two rivals a chance to contest
their skill in debate and also de-
cides the composition of theinter-
collegiate team for the year.

The question discussed this year
was, “Resolved that the United
States should subsidize the mer-
chantmarine." The Chrestotearn
c, R. Barnard, '04, H. s. Dickirr
son, ‘02, and E. F, Denison '0".
argued in favor of the question.
The Institutcrs, L. D. Smith. '03,
Henry James, '04, and George
Arnold, '02, upheld the negative.
The system of judging, so suc-
cessful last year, was again em-
ployed. Three judges. Charles
Laros. Prots. Wyckorr and Main.
judged the debate. Another set
or seven judges, H. H. Robbins.
Charles Laros, Dr. Palmer, W.
G. Ray. B. J. Ricker, and Prors.
Main and Wyckoff, ranked the
speakers according to their in-
dividual effectiveness as debaters.

The music for the evening was
as follows: Mr. Templeton, vio-
lin, Miss Burns. piano. and Mr.
Brande, vocal. ,

Prot. Nollen as chairman or the
evening called on Barnard to open
the debate for the Chrestos. His
delivery was simple and unaffected
and his argument clear, L. D.
Smith followed for the Institute.
Besides his direct argument he
took issue with some of the state
ments of‘hls opponent. He had
a ready tongue and created a rav-
orable impression. Denison,
James, Dickinson and Arnold npr
held their respective sides in the
order named. Denison had notr
ably improved his enunciatiou
and delivery since last year’s de-
bate. James gave some good
thoughts for his side; his l-low ot
language, however, not being so
good. Dickinsonseemedpcriect
ly at ease, and Arnold was as re-
liable as ever.

The two leaders, Dcnisnn and
Arnold. had seven minutes torre-
butlal; the other speakers each
had ﬁve minutes. Some spirited
discussion in regard to the use of
the WisconsimIowa debate of last
year, on the subsidy question.
created sharp feeling among the
debaters and amusement (or the

The outlook for a good team to
represent the college is encouragr
ing. From the Sophomores \leI
come at least two strong men to
make the 'Varsity, Fillmore and
James. who will probably play for
ward and guard. McKeag will be
one of the strongest men on the
team and will play forward. The
other positions are in doubt and
will only be Settled by practice
after Christmas.

ORATORICAL CONTEST.

Six Speakers to Take Part in the Annual
Contest Thursday EveningiCloSe
Contest Expected.

The
contest will be held in the college

annual home orator-ical

chapel tomorrow evening, begin~

riing at eighto‘cldck. Six speak-

ers, all members at the Chrestu-
mathian society, will compete for

the three pmes. which are ﬁfteen,
ten and ﬁve dollars. Besides the
motley prizes, the three suc-
ccsslul men will have the privi-
lege of attending the State Ora-
torical contest at the expense of
the lowa College oratorical asso-
ciation. The winner of the ﬁrst
prize will represent the college in
the oratorical contest, while the
winners of the ﬁrst and second
plizes will represent the college
at the banquet and business meet-
mg.

The speakers this year will have
a decided advantage overthosc of
prevrous years because they have
had the servicesotan experienced
instructor. The contest should
be of more than ordinary interest.
Itis a’lamentable tact that but
one of the tour literary societies
which compose the association
has representatives in the contest.
This certainly an abnormal
stall: of affairs and would seems
ingly pointto the fact that three
of the societies are not interested
in oratory.
