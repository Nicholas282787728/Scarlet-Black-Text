‘ A FORMER issue of the SCARLET
AND BLACK contained the
nouncement of this year's Y. M.
C. A. Lecture Course and a brief
' account of each number. This is
one of the strongest courses that
has been offered to a Grinnell
audience for years. The lecture
course Committee has spared
neither labor nor money to secure
the most valuable talent possible.
The musical numbers need
commendation from us; the fact
that they have been tavorably res
ceived in the United States and
Europe speaks for itself. Each
lecture will be presented by a man
who is a specialist ill his line oi
work. There are who can
teach us more in a lecture at one
hour than we can learn from thc
study of a book in a whole wecli.
They have brondencdltheir minds
and acquired their knowledge by
means of study and travel. They
can impart to us in a short time
that which has cost them years of
hard labor and experience. They
realize the interdependency of the
human race and generously bring
to us the results of their wider
privileges. It is this high class of
talent that the committee has ens
dcavorcd to secure. Every stu-
dent has the opportunity of at-
tending this Course for a small
sum.‘ No student should neglect
this opportunity. The privilege
