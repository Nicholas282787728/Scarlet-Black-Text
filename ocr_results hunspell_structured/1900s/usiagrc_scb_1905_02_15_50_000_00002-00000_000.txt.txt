HE Hegt'slcl' l‘llLll Ladder of Mull-

day, February 13, contained

the following communication iroiu
Mount Vernon:

The Charges Lo the reﬂect. that the
action of Fred Clark, Cornell’s repre-
sentative iii the state crawl-ital con-
testin using the same oration with
which he won ﬁrst place in the con-
test la t year, waslnckin; iii generosi-
ty. has aroused much comment here.

The ML. Vernon Record (llscu. es

llcatllinewhich inliln’ltes Limb Grin-
Hell‘s action li’isybeen taken because
oi tear that Iowa College cannot win
the contest.

The Record says, in part:

“vall College l5 exercised collsirlei'il-
lily over the prospect oi Cornell‘s
again winning the state orator-ical
contest, and for tint venison “Semict

has considerable to say about the pro-
priety oi the winner-or the cinrcst ape

the reasoning seems absurd. Clttrlr,

less it must begranted that the Mnulit.
Vernon Record is better acquainted

These remarks are made with a feel-
ing of hesitation, for Sonata-c awn
BLACK would be sorry indeed to be the
cause of any ill tecling between Iowa
College and Cornell, the friendship be-
tween these two institutions having,
as we hope, always been asouice or
mutual satistnotion. It may be as-
sumed however that this {riondship
has grown so strong as easily to with-
stand the shock oi one unpleasant eple
