. Debate.

The Annual Intersociety Prev
liminary Debate wiilbe held in
the College Chapel Saturday
evening. Jan. I9, at eight o’clock.
The question for debate is in re-
gard to the merits of the mayor
and council systems of municipal
government and is one of the fore

' most problems or the day. An
interesting teature of the debate
will be the introduction of the
eastern system ot speaking which
gives ear/z debater in addition to
12 minules for direct presentation,
Io minutes for rebuttal, There is
also an added interest from the
fact that the team to represent
Grinnell in the debate with Wash-
burn College will be chosen from
the speakers in this debate, and
the rivalry for this honor is al~
most as keen as for the decis n
of the debate itself. In the past
the manner of selecting speakers
has not been entirely satisfactory
and in this debate a new system
will be tried. Three judges se
lected by the debaters will decide
the meritsotthequestion. seven
other judges. chosen trom a list
submitted to the debaters by the
executive committee, will
sider the qualiﬁcations of the
speakers Each ot these seven
judges will mark each speaker on
the basis of I00 per cent and horn
the ﬁnal rank thus obtained the
three best debaters will be chosen
for the college team. The debate
promises to be one ot the most
interesting and hotly contested
Contests ever held in Grinnell and
will be well worth attending.

How to Train,

In answer to a special request
from SCARLET AND BLACK, Trainer
Watson gives a new suggestions
aboutpreparationsforspringtrack
work:

Now since we have commenced
preliminary training in the gym-
nasium the object in view is mere-
ly to make preparation {or spring
track athletics. It behooves every
member and sub of the track team,
as well as the candidates, to ems
brace the golden opportunities
which our beautiiul gym affords;
and while this preliminary exer-
cise is being indulged in bear in
mind that those participating in

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA,

the same are not only greatly hens
eﬁting themselvesphysically, but
are at the same time laying a tonn-
dation which will enable them to
successfully cope with the battles
of lite in after years.

Because we did not win the state
meet the last year or two, some
outsiders harbor the idea that we
are like ancient Athensia thing
ot the past, I do sincerely hope
that there is no Grinnell man lose
tering within him such opinions.
It is true we are greatly handi-
capped in every conceivable man-
ner, save our spirit. The latter is
our only hope. Spirit, ambition,
coupled with that bulldog tenacity
has won many competitions for
Iowa College in the past and
must do it in the future. Now in
regard to trainingiThe ﬁrst
thing and most important of all
is regularity. Be regular in all
things and you will hardly,ll ever,
be sick. What shall I eat is
often the question asked by ath»
letes, especially beginners. My
answer is. whatever you like, pro.
viding it agrees with you. At
the same time I do not advocate
the use ot par/rm any shape or
form. Ityou will eat it have it
cooked thoroughly. Avoid strong
tea or coffee, tea is bad enough,
but coIfee, is in my estimation,
worse. Shun tobacco in every
shape and torm, in fact shun every
appearance ot evil and always
try to cleave to that which is good,
by doing so you will sooner or
later climb the ladder and eventus
ally lodge in the heights of athlet-
ic tame. Jon . P. w ~sox.
