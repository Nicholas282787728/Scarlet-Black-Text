SENIOR PROGRAM.

The ﬁrst or the.class programs
in the Institute was given by the
senior members of the society last
Wednesdayevening. Itconsistcd
ot a mock faculty meeting, some
ot the professors being impersonc
atcd by those who thought they
could penetrate into the mysteries
of such an affair and present the
result ot their imagination to a
student audience.

The make~up in each case was
excellent and the characters did
not need to be called by name to
be recognized, The reports from
the chairmen of the different comr
mittecs were especially interesting
in that they gave an idea of the

 

matincrotdealingwiththetroublc»
some problems which students are
siipposcd to fill nish the faculty.

Music was lui'nislicd between
acts by Misses Bolisquct and Mil~
lard and Mr. Parks and was very
much appreciated by all. The
next class program will be given
in two weeks by the juniors.

“WANTED. MEN."

At the association meeting
Thursday evening about sixty til
the man of the college had the
privilege or hearing w. s. Lacey,
secretary of the Young Men's
Christian Association at Oskar
loosa. TliesubjectofMl',Lacey’s
talk was “Wanted, Men.” and was
treated in a way which. though
quiet and unassuming. compelled
the closest attention ot his hear-
ers. The need for men of com»
age. of application, at character
was strongly presented. and an
earnest plea was made to those
present to make their lives count
for something really worth while.
Mr. Lacey is a young man or
pleasant personality and greatly
devoted to his work. His success
at Osltaloos] has been extraorr
diiiary. and marks him as one of
the strong men among the asso
ciation workers.

Thc enjoyment of the meeting

was greatly augmented by the
two sclections rendered by the
college quartet. consisting of
Messrs. Condit, Haillcs. Evans
and Chasc.
