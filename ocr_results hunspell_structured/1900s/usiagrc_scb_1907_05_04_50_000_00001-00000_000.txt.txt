A COLLEGE MANS CHARACTER.

The relation DI the students it) the
college was the theme of President
Main’s chapel talk yesterday morning.

The college student is a conspicuous
character wherever he is He repre-
senis his college, and cnnsequently
any wrong act on his part will injure
rhe College to greater extent in ii few
moments than hundreds of others
can repair in a year. A thoughtless
action will put self and college in the
hands of enemies, Itis the business
of all to See that the right standards
are maintained, The college is the
place to develop‘ and reform both self
and character. A spirit or coopera-
tion is needed to carry out such de-
velopment and that is the spirit
which is manifested in Iowa College.
Class spirit is a good thing, but. above
all class spirit resrs the college spirit.
The Fraternity is a good thing and
supplies a fellowship and social life in
many places which could not be gain
ed any other way. In Iowa College
Fraternities are not demanded. The
spirit or Fraternnlism of College De-
mocracy which pervades the whole
institution takes the place of the
Fraternity, '

“ACQUXRE WHILE rN YOUTH."

Things Added in anesnlr in Early Lire
' Have the Greatest Value,

Last year Dr. Steiner, in one or his
masterly addresses at Chapel, urged
upon the student bodythe proposition
that now was the time to spend, to be
extravagant, to secure for one's self
while young the best things chub life
has to give. The‘ only limitdcion
placed upon this spending habit was
to maintain a condition as nearly as
possible approaching solvency, and to
spend only ior the best things—a
picture, a book, a lecture. or cancel-ti
andall these, the best obtainable.
The reason he made very evident—
that the Ireshness of youth enhanced
a hundred'icld the value or every such
acquisition, and made more sweet and
precious its possession or its memory
in later life. The inference is very
evident in the present, instance. The
May Festival concerts are some of
these "best things.” They would not
have been undertaken at all if they
had not been so, Tile symphony urn
cheslra is che acme oimiisical achieve-
ment. The greatest music is written
ior it and played by itin the greatest
manner. The May Festival is the
musical happening or a year wliiclihas
been very rich in musical happenings
nthe event which Eli) one can atl‘Di'd
to miss, The price one pays in miss-
ing it—Lhe lass to the richness and
sweetness or one’s own personal life#
would bernhniteiy greater than any
two dollar admission fee could
measure.

In general this
everyone. and every indication tends
to prove that it is unnecessary to urge
the May Festival. Yeti "lest we for-
get" the present reference to Dr.
Steiner‘s theory of investment‘aiid re~
turns may not come amiss.
