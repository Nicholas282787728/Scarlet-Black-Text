Help Seriie a Live Question.
With the renewed activity in re
gard to the semester lee business the
last doubt as [D the importance and
liveness or the question should be dis-
persed. The supporters and agitators
of the scheme, of which the SCARLET
AND BLACK isoue, are determined to
leave the question settled. The fair
proposition that if 20 per cent at the
student body are opposed to the idea
it will be dropped has been made by
the college council commute. The
effort to gain an expression of opinion
from as large a number as possible
must meet with the hearty coopera-
tion or every student. If you are op~
posed to the plan feel no hesitation in
saying so. Its advocates are sincere
in their desire to settle the question
so do all you can to aid them in their
work, The SCARLET AND BLACK is
still glad to print communication on
the subject if they tend to settle any
of the diiliculties presented by the
plan.
