a toricnl Contest rlraus near
a good many of our exchanges are
sei. rig the opportunity to take
sides on the question concerning
the proposed plan for the contests
in the [utulet It will be tetncmr
bet—ed that the executive commit-
tee of the state assoc on recom-
mended alter due consideration at
its last meeting a couple of months
ago, that the new plan should in
elude no provisions for judges in
tltoughtand compos 'on to actins
dependently oi the judges on
delivery but that one set ofjildges
should act at the time of the cle-
iivery, giving ils verdict in tavor
of the oration presented with the
greatest all round effectiveness,
taking into consideration or
course, the thought and compost
tion of each oration asjudgetl from
the speakers own presentation in
aclu'il contest. To obviate the
difﬁculty oi hearing a large num-
ber oi productions in one evening
it is proposed to divide the state

into two sections and to hold two '

preliminaries, one t'orthern Iowa
and one Southern thus making it
possible {or every speaker to be
heard nhlle the \ ttners in the
two sectional contests would meet
in a grand ﬁnal state afhir at
winch the victor would be picked.

Without pretending to be the
mouthpiece of the Gl'imlell As-
sociation SCARLET AM) BLrict;
herewith ventures to express an
opinion. Ilis inevitable that tin»
tier the proposed system that de-
1iyery will be a greater iactor than
it is tlndct the present plan, In
other words the munnerisms, the
voice, the handsomcness, the
statute oi the speaker, his in»
stinets and physical endowments
will count for more in his favor
thrul will the decpnussot his rca
soniag and the ielicity olhis lllerr
any expression. Uponthesc condr
tions it not difﬁcult to conceive

well

ity as the Winner of luurels over a
competitor who has had the illlelr
lect to produce an oration which
is masterpiece of clearncss and
elegance but who lacks a little at
his rrval's graces in the ‘tpeclactis
lat. Evidently such a test is not
the one by which Demosthenes
and the deiormed apostle Paul
have been accorded rank as mas
ters of the art. Men read the
oration on the Crown, and the

judgment of the critic concurring:
with the testimony of History to
the eiiect that the Greelr pillrlol

the general familiarity wrth his
orations asthey now exist and the

the minds of melt couid not give
him the high plttce among thc
world's ortitors which he holds lo»

our antetculs and may our de-
cisions not be rendered according
to the degree in which our emo-
tions have been aroused until we
have tempered onrinipnlsesot the

any other standards is, in our
mind, to change the deﬁnition oi
the word Oratory.
