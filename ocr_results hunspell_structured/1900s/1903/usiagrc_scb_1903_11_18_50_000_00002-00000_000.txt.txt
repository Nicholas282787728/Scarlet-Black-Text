The facts will be quite contrary
to such a supposition. Indeed
we may expect some pleasant
revelations about three

from obscurity with the results of
all their sttitly and drill to do bat

from Cornell. In the meantime

EASTDES MOINES WINS CHAM-

Content with the weight at post
laltrels the Grlnnell High School
cheerfully submitted to n tlelertt
at the liandsol a better team last
Saturdhy. East Des Moines eurn-
ed in its victory a clear title to
the state championship, It was
East's game from the very start
and although Grinnell wtis there
all the time nith the best resist-
' it was ap-
ten minutes
otplay that the only teal ques»
tion would he the SII.) otthe score.
A good ﬁght therefore and an ac»
caslonal glimmer or hope for a
score was all the Giiilnell contitr
gentcould enjoy. At the close
ofthe ﬁrst half the Des Noincs
had rolled up seventeen
points. Grinnell tvnsﬁi-stto score
in the second, making her ﬁve
points on an earned touchdown.
Des Moltles anchly retnlrated,
however, nnd did her opponents
better, kicking goal and raising
the score to twentyrtlltee where it
stood till the end.
