Tire Most Successful Contest In Years
was Held Wednesday, December

oratorical contest,

The home
held on the last Wednesday oi
r: the best held at
Grinneii tor several years, It was
won by Tliol'uidltlsen RISS J. l-
Heercu, sccond;alid Mabel Smith,
thri-d. Tire program was opened
by music by the college quartet,
after which H. D. Hutchiiis de-
livered the ﬁrst oration on the
subject, "Dives and Lazarus,"
Character and culture. he said, are
the results of conlllct. The char-
acter of the strongest men is ham
mered and beaten into its ﬁnal
shape in the struggle of life.
From the old story the modern
Dives may learn the lesson that
he must help Lazarus, the man
whoseadvantageshavebeenieuer
than his own, else there will be the
uprising of the beast in Lazarus
and both are liable to be destroy-
ed by revolution,

D. E. Bruiidatze followed uitli
an oration on, "Ultimate Aristos

of money. of physical strength,
have been the basis of aristocracy
at drt‘tercnt times. Today
America, not the man with the
title, nor the man with the dollar,
nor the man who is a great soldier,
are those who compose the aristo
crazy, but the men of intellectual
power. rTliere is one more step to
betakenmoteducationorintellects
ual poucr but human sympathy
must be the ﬁnal test for the
aristocrat.

Attcrfmrrsic J. J- IIeeren spoke
on “Santa Twentieth Century
Problems.” Every nation has its
diFﬁculties and America is no ex~
ception. Among our pressing
questions is that of taxation and
the Swiss scheme ot graduated
taxes on property and
offers many useful features that
might be adopted. Tire nrad rush
for wealth otters another problem
for soltttion. Education and a
better system of taxation will do
much to remedy this trouble.
Drhﬁcultios between employers
and employees must be avoided
by some iorm ot arbitration;
politics must be puriﬁed so that
clean men may go to our legisr

on “The Healing oftlic Nations."

address of tlle evening entitled,
"HugoGrotius-vl‘lis Personality,"
giving a splendrd exposition of
the characteristics of power atid
ability of the great authority on
international law.

IIarry Leyenberoer then spoke
on the subject. “The Dormant
Nation of the East.” He gave a
strong talk on the paradox of the
Chinese character, slow. painstak-
ing, not to be forced, superstitious
and cruel. but industrious and
Iiugztl, which in time will enable
the Cliiiiaman to make the same
advance that has been made by
his brother in Japan.
