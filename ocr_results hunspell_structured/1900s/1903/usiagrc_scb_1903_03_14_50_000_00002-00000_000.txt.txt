HERE is much more in a
contest such as last even-
ing’s debate than the mere tvin-
nrng or losing a debate. To the
successful team victory is sweet
and to the losers defeat seems
bitter. but alter all, the winning
orlosingtheeontestisthc smallest
part of an inter-collegiate debate,
vThe victory or defeat is but a
small item, an incident when com-
pared with the real meaning of
such a Contest. Several men have
been hard at work for months in
preparation for the debate, devel-
opingpowerotresearchand power
of speaking that is some day to
help in the world outside, Men
have received a lesson ill receiving
victory'or defeat with equal grace.
But the contest means more than
this. It is a part otthc lriendiy
relations of two institutions ol
learning. It is another bond in
the great brotherhood of learning
which is the brotherhood of all
who stand for advance and devel-
opment in every line.

., T again seems necessary to call
. attention to the tact that
among the good townsmernot Grin-
nell there is a class of a very ten
to whom the term “kids” would be
much more applicable than the
title oi gentlemen, by which tircy
are commonly known, It is in
deed deplorable that in a college
community at this sort, where the
highest aim ot both the coilcgc
and the town is to form an ideal
union, that there are lliose who
constantly strive to bring the ef
torts ot these good people into
disrepute. Thosedeicgationswho
come to Grinnell as the friends
and guests of the college and con.
duct themselves as ordetly and
gentlemaniy as did Cornell, do
serve no such treatment, even_at
the hands of the worst of miscrer
ants, as was the display ot rowdy-
ism and banner stealing at tlle de-
potlast evening. \Nhenroughness
is shown to the men ot avisiting
school it can sometimes be passed
over, but when rudeness and un-
gentlemanly actions are directed
against the young women, the

tnost stringent measures should be
taken to punish the offenders. All
visiting aggregations arc here as
the friends of the college, and the
sltow of hospitality should be as
sincere as that which we render to
our individual guests.

THE MASS MEETING.
Accordrngto previousannounce-
merit the students gathered at the
chapel Thursday atternoon to stir
up more enthusiasm for the inter-
collegiate debate. The meeting
wasa howling success in more
ways than one. Tire speeches
were stirring, the yelling vigorous
and college spirit was much in
evidence; in short a regulation
mass meeting, tarniiiar to every
old Grinnellian, was held.
President Hutchins, of
debating union, presided and call-

glorious victory would be won
