THE NINTH ANNUAL CONCERT
OF THE GLEE CLUB AND
ORCHESTRA

it has become a commonplace
to refer tothc home conceit or
the Iowa College Glee Club and
the Amplii’on Orchestra as “the
social event of tile college year.”
Certainly, no other entertainment
ot the year draws so large an
audience. or arouses a more hearty
ieeling of good-tellowshio. The
concert of yesterday evening. the
ninth of its kind, was no exception
to the rule. The audience was
probably thc largest that
‘greetedthetwo organizationsslncc
their establishment, the Congre-
gational church being ﬁlled ale
most to the limit of its capacity.
The many familiar faces of former
years seen in the audience in»
dicated that the Glee Club con-
cert is more and more beconring a
rallying-day tor the sons and
daughters ot Iowa College; and
nothing could contribute more
titan the return of these old and
young grads to give the occasion
character and distinction. _

Thc music ottered in the pro»
gramme was quite worthy of the
gcnorous support accorded to the
concert bythc public. There ivas
sufﬁcient variety, both of music
and non»music (counting the en
cores), to appeal to every taste;
but the programme as a whole
was quite exceptional for the high
order of the selections it included.
Everybody knows that what a
glee club audience wants is not
music but fun, It was therefore
a somewhat bold venture to offer
a programme so largely made tip
otgcnuine music. indeed, many
of the numbers presented were
such tltat the ordinary chorus of
college men would have made sad
havoc of them. Thccliib as a whole
and the quartcttc, which has al
ready won desetvcd plaudits trom
many a critical audience, vicd
with each other in ease and ﬁnish,
beauty of tone. delicacy and surc-
ness oi expression; the voices have
never been better blended or
betterundcrcontrolthanthisyear.
It was a rare pleasure to listen to
the interpretation of exquisite
pieces of music as the MacDowell
numbers, or the two interesting

manuscript selections, Mr. Smith’s

THE HYDE PRtZ
In order to stimulate interest
in the Hyde i’iize iUt' excellence

in oratory it was decided this

year to try the plan of basing ihcl

selection of speakers [or the com-
nicncement contest iipon the lite
erary organizations instead oi up
The plan eii~
titles each college liteiary society
to ttvo representatives, though by
a special arrangement this ycar
between the men’s and women's
societies the former will have
three and the latter only one re-
presentative each next June.

The representatives of each so-
ciety will be chosen by prelimin—
ary contests open to aii mcmbcrs
irrespective of classes. The ora-
tions must be in the hands of the

protessors of the English De-
partment not later titan April 25,

to be judged on thoughtand com-
position. The society contests
in delivery will be held the week
ending May 9th. Two weeks
will then be allowed for the ﬁnal
revision of the successlul orations,
that is tip to the 23d of May, The
Final contest will be held Monday
June 8th.

Society rivalry ought to do a
great deal towards reviving
interest in this important prize;
and the various societies should

do their utmost to ivork up cir-
thusiasm over the pi‘ellrnii‘iarics,as
only by this can they hope to win
out ﬁnally. the total income of
the Hyde iund is titty dollars,
ivliichundcr this new airangcrnent
will be divided into two prizes,
the ﬁrst of thirty dollais the
