THE COMING TRACK SEASON.

From the Manager's Strindpoint.

\Vltll the sound (ll the referee's \vltisllc
which prrts air end to the annual Thanks
giving iootball struggle and closes the
season tor the greatautunrnal sport, the
outtloor college athlete gives otter tlte
center or the stage to lollowers ol less
violent pursuits, and intercollegiate de
haters, orators and members oi tlte col-
lege glee club srrcceed tlte possessors oi
mcre brute iorce in popular iavor. But
though retired rront public view and tire
lcrcst, the athlete is neverlllclcsshard at
work. Scarcely have the moletskins
been laid aside and talk oi end rrrns antl
line bucks died away when the candidate
lor track honors shakes the dust lronr his
spikes and nappers anti begins work in
the gyntnasiunt preparatory to the Con-
tests or ilte coating spring, nhile rumors
oirecord breaking Jumps aitd oi itien
rrho cart (10"evcns" begin to ﬁll the air.

As soon as the irost is well out oi the
ground and almost simultaneous with the
tirst feamered harbingers oi spring the
college athlete appears again to claim
undisputed stray ori tlte campus and to
show that in the spring a young man's
iancy is lully as liable totrirn to thoughts
oi ﬁeld meets as to any-thing else. Any
chance observer who ltappens to stray
irtto the athletic park at this time oi year
willbetmpressed at otice with the re-
markable evolritieit which the athlete
has undergone dnrirtg his rive Inonlhs'
retirement. The organism adiustitig
ttseli to its changed environment has

Baseball has its fans; tennis always
drawsits partizau devotees; the attrac-
tions oi the goli links or howling alley
prove more alluring than library or lab-
oratory to a strong faculty contingent
but antorig all the verual sports ior
real enthusiasm which sets tlte nerves
on edge and calls mm the heartiest
clteers, the track nteets when the ﬁnest

stand unrivalled.

At this time it ntay, perhaps, be oi
some interest to lovers oi athletic sport
in lowa College to glance over the
schedule, which has been prepared tor
Grinncll's iraclt team during the coating
spring

Since the ﬁrst held meet in than uhcn
the scarlet and black \vm Cd (rlunlpllam,
tierer ltas there hten a schedule require
ing greater eiioris on the part or the
men; never has there been a series ol
contests which would 50 test their nerve
and endurance; never has there been (l
season demanding stricter training and
greener selI-tlcnial than that \\'lllCl1 now
conli-onts the team at I903,

On April ioth, barely ttirec days arter
tlte spring vacatlon has passed, ihei k
season will probably be opened by the
Sophalrmme resliiriaiiDuai Meet. The
interest in this event has increased with
cacti year since its establishment some
hall dozen years ago till it ltas now won
its owit peculiar place on the schedule
ll, as is not entirely impossible, it should
seenr best to dispense with this ntcet this
year it will only be due in the direst
necessities orthe case and with iltc \In»
derstanding that it is to be resuntod in
1004.

On the {chewing Saturday, April 16,

 

will occur the annual Home Meet when
class enthusiasnt reaches its highest
prtcli during the school year. The meet
thisyear will have especial interest as
the class oi too; has won this meet in
all three oi their college years and it rviil
be every one against the Seniors to pr:~
reitt thertt repeating the perrormance oi
the classes or o; and loo by securing an
unbroken series of successes during the
tour years oi tlteir college course.

on May 2 the team will go to Amcs to
meet the hrrsky lads ol the Agricultural
College. The Antes team will be coached
this season by “Bernie” \Verers probably
the lastest amateur sprinter who ever
donned spikes which will insure them
astrong team, lor Antes hae always
possessed a wealth or material.

On May 9 at wtlrd i-‘ieltl Gritinell
will be pitted against her old rivttls from
UniversityPlace, Des .Vlolncs. Drake
has this year one oi the strongest teams
in herhistory and probably the strong
est teamin the state. For weeks her
athletes have been hard at work and
their records indicate that the team
which will contest lor the “blue and
while" this year is capable or trying the
mcttleoianyteamrn the middle west.
This will be the ﬁrst intercollegiate
track contest held in Grinnell ior ntanv
ycnrs and should draw a large crowd.

On Mar- tethe old Dual League be.
tween loua and Grinnell now sortie
years dciunct rvill probably be revived
atlowa City. in years gone by this
was one oi great events oi the spring
and its revival will be rvelcorrted by
iriends or both institutions. Tltough the
arrangements are not yet completed the
meet rvill doubtless be held at lowa

City.
The lolloiving Friday, May 22. will be

a day of rest among lswa college learns,
preparatory to the great event oi the
year at the Capital City on the next Frie
day. Ward Field will, however, be the
scene oi unusual activity, ior some twene
ty high schools will send teams to Grine
ncll to compete lor the scholastic chame
pionship on this data Plans arealready
being made tor the entertainment oi our
guests and it is hoped that the whole
college lvllljoln in making the event a

complete success.
On Friday, May co, the state meet at

Des Moines will close the season so iar
as lowa contests are concerned, though
ateam may be sent to Chicago, as has
been sometimes done til pastyears, to

 

in what was lormerly the Western lnlerr
participate Collegiate meet, now the
Conference mCCL

Many will doubtless reel that tltis is
too heavy a schedule tor the track tcant.
but those who have worked under Train-
er Watson in the past know that the lact
iliatthe wily Scot, who measures suc-
cess not by victories alone, has ciit out
this work tor his men, is prooienough
that they are capable or accomplishing
it with honor, ii they tollow his illslnlc»
