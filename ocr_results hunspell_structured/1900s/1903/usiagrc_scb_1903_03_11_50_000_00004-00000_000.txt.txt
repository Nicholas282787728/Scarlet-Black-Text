SENIORS ARE ENTERTAINED.
One or the most pleasant and
successful social affairs of the year
was the party given by the Sopho
more class to the Seniors on last
Saturday rltgltt. The program
was of an unusual order and cor
rcspondingly interesting. the main
feature being the exhibition of
portralts of members of thc scnior
c‘ass. Some sophomore artists
had done the sketching. In all

HANDICAFS,

The handicap events the
gymnasium Saturday afternoon
were not as successful as heret0~
fore. Several of the most promis-
ing men, including Boyd and
Henyon,were absent and those
who took part did very mediocre
work. Tilton in therhigh juntp
did 4-H and tied for ﬁrst, Bair
and Clow tied for third. The
broadiump was won by I’Iealdt
