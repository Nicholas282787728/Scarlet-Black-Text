There was a noticeable diFferr
ence in the styles of the two tennis.
Cornell's speakers were the more
oracular and impressive in de-
livery. Grinnell's were simple
and direct. Cornell gave the im-
pression ot delivering set speeches

troubled as to their sequence. In
their rehutials this was especially
marked and Grinnelrs superiority
here was clearly evident to all.
Nevertheless the arguments were
well joined and the contest well
tought irom end to end. Indeed
the contrast between the teams
only served to enhance the inter
est in the discussion.

Grinnell may well be proud ot
