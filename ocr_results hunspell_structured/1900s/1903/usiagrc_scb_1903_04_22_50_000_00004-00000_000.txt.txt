BASEBALL OUTLOOK.

After the recent defeat of the
the 'Varsity at Marshalltown the
ﬁrst question which presents it»
self to the mind of the baseball
enthusiast is, “What will bethc
result when we meet the college
teams?" or one thing we may be
certain and that is that we are
going to encounter the very
strongest kind or rivalry for the
silver bat.

Ames is stronger than ever be-
lore and iscunﬁdent or winning.
Cornell promises to give us lively
opposition from their corner and
Iowa, while always selling “hard
luck papcrs" may be counted on
asa dark horse which must be
considered, Our team has lost
three of last years stars and their-
places must be ﬁlled with new and
inexperienced men.

It is only by the hardest kind
of work and the hearty co-operaa
tion of the student body that we
can hope tor a fair mcasurc or
success.

Let every candidatc appear for
practice promptly on time. Let
every student who is ableto do so
attend the daily practice at Ward
Field and let us all unite in a
grand effort to make this the most
successiul season in the history of
lowa College athletics.

ercises celebratingthe ﬁftieth suc-
cessful year of the cxistence of
thc ChrestomathianSociety. Dur
ing its history the society has

numbered among its members

hundreds of the students of Iowa
College and in Its lite as the aide
est college literary socrety west

cnviable record. In debating the

society has won thirteen out or

ing the current year has won the

developed and grown within its
ranks.
