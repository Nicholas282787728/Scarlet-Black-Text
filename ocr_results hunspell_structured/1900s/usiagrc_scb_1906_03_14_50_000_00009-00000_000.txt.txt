THE WORK OF Y. w. c. A. AND ITS

(ieelll) upon the lite oi lire college
then thc Young \romnn's Christian
Association. it is tho source and cells
ter not onlr oi the religious liic, but
ot the social iiic as well

.-\L rhc recent annual business mort-
iug ot' the Association reports were
given ot the year's work, which were
most encouraging and proved that the
year had been a prosperous one. There
are at present 257 girls enrolled as
members, 150 oi whom are doing ac-
tire committee work,

There has been an unusual interest
in Missions this year, some ninety
girls spcnding one hour it week in the
study oi! Missionary worlt. The class
cs conducted by Miss Allah Hopkins
and Mrs. Sain Crosby tor the Study oi
Social Problems in Oui' Large Cities
have been exceedingly interesting.

A room in Chicago Hall has been ﬁt;
ted up and iurnishcd as an onioe end
place for committee meetings. it pres
sants a. very attractive appearance,
with its rugs and mission style on {ur-
niture.

The establishing oi a Practical Set»

but the encrgy that these girls have
shown and the practicai service they
have rendered to the Association in

has been our aim Lo make ere . girl
realize that we are a Christian Ass
sociation and Christ's workers.

Although the reports ior the past
year seem encouraging, the present
resources appear small when one
views the needs oi the coming yenr.
The new building must be iuroished;
responsibility must be assumed ior
the heating, lighting and ja nitor ser-
rices. Thus the budget will needs be
increased by‘ hundreds oi dollars.

As our Association increases in
numbers and resources, the need oi n
Student Secretary is lreeniy ielt. The
responsibilities upon the President oi
the Y. w. and the Cabinet are heavy-v,
demanding much tune and cherry.
There is the danger oi losing sight
