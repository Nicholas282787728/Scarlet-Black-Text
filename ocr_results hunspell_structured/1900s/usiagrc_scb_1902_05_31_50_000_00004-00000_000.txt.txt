week, and will consist only of

those students who will take hold

of the \VUlk cmlluslasticﬂlly, and

whose turn will be not only to

make personal gain, but to piovc

. , l
the possibilities forCl Cllllelbld work

in Oratory among the students oi
Iowa College.

At some time during the [all
teini. those students who have 5e~
cured the best results from
or private wail; will have the piivi-
lege otcompeting in preliminaries
toi pliices iii the Home Contest
At the close of tile winter
another series of preiiltiitialies
will take place. From these the
oratms will DC chosen for the
Hyde Prize contest in the spring.
Any student of the college will be
permitted to enter these pielinii-
names but no stildent can enter
the ﬁnal contest who has notgain-
ed the right by prevlous competi-
lion.

It has been argued that no Sllls
dent should feel that his college
course is complete without some
knowledge of the principles oi
public speech, and without some
training in the practical applicae
tion otthose principles. It is also
true that no student whose only
preparation has been a few hours
of coaching should attempt to
represent his college in public
work. In view of these facts this
opportunity is offered in the hope
that the progress so much désired
will result.

A registration fee of 52.00 will
be required of each student tor
one tcrm’s work. There will be
no other expense. Whether or

not the work willcontinue during
the winter term will depend upon
the Support given bythc students.

Miss Smith will be glad to re-
ceive. before the closeottheyenr,
the names of any who may wish
(0 enter the class.

dcred by Mr. MacKcllzie, italmost
seemed as if the old doctor had
been n personnl iricnd of the audr

The reading was worthy otn
much larger audience. Hardly a
score of students were present,
and the pews were spnrseiy ﬁlled
with townsmen. This should not
be the case whenaddresscs of sucll
genuine interest and entertain-
