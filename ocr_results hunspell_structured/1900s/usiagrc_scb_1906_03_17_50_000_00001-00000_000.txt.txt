rebates were not in the question. Unr

and a. commission should be given the

The last speaker or the negative was

discriminatiops today are secret r
bntes, dud government rute making
will not sure this evil. He proposed
that braille rates should be Submitted
which would be under government Su-

The superiority of the ullll‘mdl/ive
was more oleurly evident in the rebut-

case in ct convincing manner. The

stated in the beginning, the plan [he
allirmativo should follow. in establish-
ing Lheircase. His purpose, he said,
would be to show the necessity or ac.
tion being taken to control the un-,
just practices or railway companiesl

 

The second speaker would show that,

neither congress nor the courts were
the proper agents ror handling prob-
lems or this klnd and that the only
body capable was the commission;
the last speaker in oiild prove that the
commission should pluco the rote into
enect at once. This plop was held to
quite consistently throughout the do
bate. The ﬁrst :tll‘lrmntlve attacked
the negative by showing the evils ex.
isting and spent his entire speech
showing the iniustico or rebutesaud
di riminations. The second chirpin-
tive showed that Congress was inope-
quate because ol the great amount or
business with which it must already
deal, the courts are unjust to the poor
shipper who is imposed upon, and
that the comlnssslons post record was
in itscli conclusive evidence or its on
liciency. The last speclrpr placed his
entire speech in showing the popular
demand {or a, remedy rather than
showing the necessity for placing the
rutc into ell‘eot at once as was suggest-
ed in the general outline.

The negative in the beginning ad.
mitted that many evils exist itnd than
some means should be devised for re-

moving those evils but they roiused Lo
ancepn the proposed Scheme because it
was radical and inellectlve. They
held that ill would be giving too
much power to the commission, it
would be denying the railroads a just
court review: they contended that the
commission would be inelliuicnt and
incapable 01' handling: the complex
