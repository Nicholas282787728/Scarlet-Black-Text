R. Andrew Carnegie. who re.
a1 eenrly gave Grinnell a
large sum tor a library, and in
whom Grinneil people are thus
especiallyinterestedhas found of
late two places where his niuniri-
cence will be of aid and will make
a step in the solution of two at
the greatest ploblems men are
facing today, It is the general
consensus of opinion that Booker
T. \Vashington has the best plan
for the solution of the race prObr
lem in America and that the
Tuskegee Institute will be a potent
factor in the ﬁnal settlement of
the problem, By his gift of 5600.
000 Mr. Carnegie has greatly the
creased the Capitcity and power
for usefulness of that gleat insti-
tution, It wastltought that a great
stride had been taken toward the
prevention of war and the es-
tablishment or universal peace,
when the Hague Tribunal for in-
ternational arbitration was made
a fact. This tribunal seems to
point the way toward the abolition
of war and wholesale bloodshed,
and in his gift to the tribunal
Andrew Carnegie has made a gift
to humanity as a whole. Mr.
Carnegie is furnishing also an
example of a solution of another
great problem, ol what is to be
done with the colossal fortunes,
gathered into the hands of: few as
a result of modern industrial con-
ditions. So far there has been no
more satisfactory scheme offered
than that exempliﬁed by the lord
of Skibo Castle.
