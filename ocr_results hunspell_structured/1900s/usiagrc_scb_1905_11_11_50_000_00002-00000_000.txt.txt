HUMBOLDT SOCIETY MEETING.

The discussion of “Religion as a
Factor in State Building” by Professor
Macy may be summarized in main
points as follows. In dealing with
politics inlowesb terms, we are deni-
ing with religion, since marl derives
his politics largely from his religion.
True religion brings progress, and
during the agesof violence bile races
of men having alligll form of religion
stand While others perish. In the
lowesttorln of religion, ieoich worship,
there is Iitlble of Social relation, each
individual worshiping his own god,
and the result of such religiousmbserv-
once must be mainly retrogressive,
not progressive. Tile creation of im-
agesailld bemples involve social rela4
tions, and there is, in this higher
form or religion, more or progress dur-
ing the time of the making of the in»
ages nnd Lelnples But degeneracy
lollows, and blic images and Lemples
themselves in Lurn becoming feticlles.
I’i'ith ceremony comes social relation
and progress involving large numbers
of people, but when the ceremony be-
comes second nature, it ill turn le-
comesa IeLibll. Expression Of religions
ideas in n book brings progress, but
the book itself may become a Ietich.
llut iuolloi ihese, we come short of
true religion, which is embodied iii
humnn sociciy only, hnviug ior its
objecil [lie pel‘iecb marl. Senseoi right
