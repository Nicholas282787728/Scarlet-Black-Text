Music FESTIVAL IN MAY.

Some of the Plans for the coming Oratoe
rioiNoteLI Artists to Appcar_A
Program or High Order.

Plans for the M ly concerts of
the Grirrrrell Oratorio Society are
norvcornple and the wol‘k oi
preparation r. ,l under \\lay.}\s pro
viously announced, the Ot'ittol‘lo
Society “III givea concert per-
formalice of Beethoven's opera,
Fidelio, with soloists from Chica-
go, under the direction or Mrs.
Johanna Hesthtrr, who will prer
side at the piano. The Society
has always been hampered by the
lack oiagood organ in a large
audience room suitable for the ac
companirnent oi oratorios. we
have had the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra for two years, but the
expense has been so great that
the Societycould not bear it with
but outside aid. Last year the
expedient of using a piano and
string quartet was tried, but this
was inadequate tor the accomr
paninrentota large choral work
like the Creation.

In view of these conditions the
society is iortunate in being
able to present a work which is in
the range of its ability. As Fir
delio is awork in which the solo
ists predominate, being in evi»
dence almost constantly througlr
out the opera. it does not contain
the heavy sustained choral work
which is so prominent in the ora
torios which have been given
here, anti which needs an orchesr
iro {or proper support. Therefore
the piano will be a very satisfacr
tory accompaniment {ortllis work,
especially when under the hands
oiso noted an accompanist and
artist as Mrs. ['lessrBtlrr.

Fur afternoon concert
another treat has been secured,
Apart oi the program will be
given to a short icCItal by Miss
Schiller of Chicago who sings the
part of Marcellina in Fidello, and
the balance toa performance oi
part oi St. Sacns' opera, “Samson

and Delilah.” Tllis is a modern
work and exceedingly rich in its
portrayal of the ardent passion of
the old hero, Samson, and the
varying moods of his ﬁckle mis-
tress. Delilah.

The ladies of the Chorus will
singtlre beatltiiul "Spring Cho-
rus," and the rest will be sung by
the sololsts. Mrs. Edith Evans
Scully, who is considered to be

the

the best Delilah in Chicagu, has.

been secured especially for that
part. Nearly one hali oi this en.
tire work will thus be given and
Grinnell is fortunate in being able
to hear this (amous work.

The date for the concerts has
been ﬁxed at May r3.

hundred and sixty

pilgrirns' minds were not

from the dreamcr's consciousness
the memory ofthe‘ Grinnell ban~
her as it waved none the less de~
ﬁantly over all at the close of the
program, the ﬂying ribbons of
scarlet and black and the John P.
Watson band as it played the
louder in defeat. Nearly three
hundred Iowa College students
had rallied to the support of their
debaters and every one oi them
had felt more deeply than ever the
Grllinell spirit, The college had
(lone itself proud. Its debaters
were an ubounding credit to the
institution, The lertcst debate be
tween Iowa College and Cornell
llaclltll'lled out to be the most
memorable of the whole series.
The Glinllell crowd arrived at
Mount Vernon at seven thirty and
at the end of the mile walk the
whole auditorium was to ti n cl
crowded except in the section
which had been reserved, the en-
tire west hair of the gallery. Both
factions settled in their seats, a
lriendly )elling match ensued. the

evening. The rendering of Grin

body was especially appreciated
by the visitors. Gladly would
they have reciprocated had
Cornell yells been easy to master.
Tile discussion of the question
concerned largely tlle claim oi
Grinnell that the bond system of
currency is not sufficiently elastic
to meet the need of the various
degrees of prosperity. The as-

meet all contingencies. Cornell
