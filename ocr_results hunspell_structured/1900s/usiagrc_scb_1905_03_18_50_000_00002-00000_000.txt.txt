{ENE of the most immediate 0f
the needs of Iowa College is
a better System of walkst/J connect
some parts of the campus with some
others. The nuns 01 Spring will soon
alter the condition of one of the paths,
at least, from bad to worse. In its
present, condition the direct route
from Clliczlgo Hall to thellbrr
hard one to travel and all the gravel
ualhs on the college grounds have

which our Ol'l: victorious )lelhodist
rivals continue lo rennin he. The sin-
cel’ltyolthis respect is well «lttESLed
by the glad celebration that lit the
Mount Vernon campus upon Llle return
or Lhe rlrlnrmg terun last Saturday.
This week’s Coi'llcllillil echoes the same
senumem. The renewing clipping
is from its ellllol'iul Colllllls:

“The passing or n - ueeh gives us
