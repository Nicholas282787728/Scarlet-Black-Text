The New A. U. Constitution.

The Alumni Committee, ap-
pointed at the time of the recent
banquet in Chicago, have pros
duced, after several months of
careful work, all elaborate scheme
for the future control of all
branclles of athletics in Iowa Cel-
lcge. The great defect in our
present system of management is
a lack of unity in tlle control of
money matters at home, and in
athletic policy regarding our relar
tiolls with other schools. Islcreto-
fore, each manager has been
almost wholly independent in his
particular department, and ottcn-
times has unwittingly acted in a
way detrimental to other depart-
ments. The greatest loss has been
a ﬁnancial one. Unsystcmatic exs
penditures and noll~concerted ac
tion of the managers more than
anything else, no doubt, accounts
for our indebtedness. These dc-
iects the Alumni have sought to
remedy by embodying the pro-
posed scheme in a new constitur
tion.

The essential features of the
new constitution are as follows:
A strongly centralized Athletic
Board, composed of three alumni,
one member o[ iaculty and one
student, has entire control of all
athletics during the year. Of
this Board the chairman, who by
the articles of the constitution
must be a resident alumnus, has
the most power, and except on
matters of importance, need not
convene the Board. The man~
agers must consult him on all air
tairs of policy and expenditure,
must secure his signature on all
contracts and must make itemized

quired to keep very accurate, dc-
tailed accounts and make corn-
plete reports at regular intervals
during the year. The treasurer of
the college shall be treasurer of
the Athletic Ullioll. The duties,
which are carefully delineated in
tllc constitution, involve no small
amount of time and labor on the
part of the three ofﬁcers named
aboveichairnlan of the Board,
secretary and treasurer. and that
they might not grow weary in
well-doing, a small salary is con»
nected witll each ofﬁce. A tri-
ennial publication, issued ill cons
llcction with SCARLET AND BLACK,
is expected to keep the Alnrnni in
close tollell with the affairs of the
Athletic Union and the college.
By means of this publication.
which will contain the chairman's
reports of ﬁnance and general ads
tnllliSlt'ain|l,iltC Alumni will know
the exact condition and needs of
the Athletic Union alld can regu-
late their support accordingly.

It can be seen at a glance that
the ainl of the collstitution is to
make the board of control not
only tlresupremc center-ct all ath-
letic affairs, but to make it also
the connecting link between strr
dents and Alumni. The beauty
of one common center is that pcrr
fect harmony and unity is secured
between all the dirter-cnt depart-
ments. thus permitting them to
work as one team. such unity is
the aim of this constitution.

The new constitution was read
before and approved by the exec-
utive committee of the Athletic
Union. and will probably go into
effect during the coming cour
mencenlent week. In taking this
step we are only lollowing the ex-
ample set by nearly all the big
universities, and our present con»
dition cannot but be improved.

New Debating Leagucf

For some time correspondence
has been carried on in regard to
an inter-collegiate debating league
between Beloit, Knox, Cornell and
Grinnell. At the time of tllc last
debate at Mount Vernon the mat»
ter was informally discussed by
ollr representatives and members
or the Cornell debating league,
It was agreed there that the mat-

Tlle secs
retary of the Athletic Union is lev-

 

ter should be brought to the at
tention of the debating league of
the two colleges, and it iavotable
action was taken that invitations
should be extended to Belolt and
Knox. Cornell took the initiative
and in response to an invitation,
Belort appointed a delegate to
meet with delegates from the 0th
er schools antlarlange tor such a
league. licloit suggcstcd Chicago
as a place or meeting, but would
consider other places it preferred.
Later, Knox appointed a delegate
and suggested Rock Island asa
iavorablc place [or a conference.
COi'nCll favors Rock Island and
suggested June 9th as a possible
tlate.

At a meeting of the Iowa Cole
lege debating league, Monday at-
ternoon, the work ot the prelim
irrary committec wasendorsed and
Aymer D. Davis selected as a dclr
egatc. The league tavors Rock
island and June 9th as the place
and time of meeting. Nothing furs
tllel has been done asyet, but fronl

,the tavor able responses received

from all the schools, it is evident
that the ﬁnal organization is only
a matter of detail, It is of course
impossrble to tell what system
of debates will be selected. The
method tavorcd by our league and
the one we will suggest is thatthe
ﬁrst. year a debate be held between
each of the two sets of schools#
as, for instance, Beloit vs. Cornell
and Knox vs. Grinnelliand that
the tollowrng year the rvinners of
these debates cotltesttogetller for
ﬁnal honors. Thus a regular-iota
tion would be established, each
institution having one debate a
year. Another system suggested
is that each institution should
have two teams and two debates.
Still another is that the two teams
should debate the same question
and the winning teams should then
compete the same year. These
last two systems would obviously
mrrltrply the number or debates
and be otherwise very undesirable.
But. whatcver the system chosen
there is no doubt that the added
advantage of debating with three
other schools of recognized stands
ing will be very great. Tlle larger-
league will be very conducive to a
more general intcrcst in debating
and already consider-able interest
is being manifested by the student
body. Arrangements are being
made‘tor a regular system of in-
tersociety-class debates and also
intersociety debates in the acader
my. Present indications augul'
well for future success.
