Basket Ball.

On Saturday afternoon two pre
liminary basket ball games will
be played in the men's gymnasium
between the Freshman and Junior
teanrsand between the Sophomore
and Senior teams. An admission
fee of ten cents will be charged.
It is hoped that a large crowd will
turn out to witness these contests
as the proceeds are to he used in
lighting the east end of the bases
ment oi the gymnasium so that it
may be used for track team work.

Our old opponent in debating
lines—Grinnell—has opened up
negotiations with washhurn col-
lege down in Kansas, and has
about completed
for an inter-collegiate debate.
For tour years we have had the
pleasure ot deteating our Congrer
gational brethren and we felt that
it would be best for us this year
to try conclusions with some other
foeman, Our best wishes will
lollow them, however in tlleirconr
test wttlt this new opponent and
we shall hope, when tlrey have
won two or three intercollegiate;
to have the pleasure of again
meeting them on the forensic

platformiCar/zt’llimz, you. 12,
