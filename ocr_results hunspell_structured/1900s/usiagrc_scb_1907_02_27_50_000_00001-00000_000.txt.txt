Nebl‘asllasahlllt)‘ asa basket ball
teairi is not to be disparaged, however,
for there is every reason to believe
that under better conditions they
might give our bunch an even closer
run and perhaps deleat them. it was
their last game alter an evceptionally
hardseries and although a deicatoi
Iowa‘s champions should have meant
much to them it was evident that
they cared butiittie lor the outcome
of the contest. It was probably the
hardest and most exciting basket ball
ever seeiion the iirinuell llJOr, each
man sticking to his opponent iar
“closer than a brother Nebraska
excelled in team worlr while Grinneii
was better at coping the sphere.
Though the game was rough it was
hardly a “dirty” one and little but
the best of reeling was displayed by
either side. some sensational goals
were made but they were very iew,
and the most notioeableleatul'e oi the
contest was the unceasing and wearing
hard work.

The ourtnin raiser was a warm
struggle between the high schoolls er.
celleot team and the college seconds.
The lirsthali ended in atie but the
second was entirely in the hands oi
G. ii. s. The game was snappy and
well played, Patton oi the high school
being the especial star periormer.

The line up was as iollows:

The season as a whole has'probabl y
been the most successiul ever oorlcludv
ed by a Grinnell basket ball team. We
have had our state championships be-
iore but we have usually had to play
oiiatie wrth iowa and never belore
has coe been so strong an opponen .
A double championship cameto u.
nell this year tor the iirst Lime also.
This success is especially noteworthy
when the prospects early in the sea-
son are considered, lor oi last year's
team only the guards were left. The
