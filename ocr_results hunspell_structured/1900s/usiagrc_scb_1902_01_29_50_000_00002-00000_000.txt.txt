election has been practlcally as-

sured for several weeks, but the
creation of the new ofﬁce of Dean
of the Faculty and the election of
Professor Main to that position,
comes as a great surprise to the
great majority of those connected
with the college. and is in proper
recognition of the splendid work
which Professor Main has done as
actiugrpresident. during the last
year and a hall'. and, indeed, of
the work he has done during all
the years he has been ill Grinnell.
The duties of the new ofﬁce have
not been clearly deﬁned, but are
embraced in the general statement
that they will be connected with
the internal affairs of the college,
and the electron of Professor
Main to this posrtion insures that
the educational policy of the col-
lege will be directed along the
same progressive lines that have
characterized it for the last few
years. and thitt the college will
continue to be at the head of the
colleges or tone.

The need or a president who is
tree to devote his whole time to
the interests of the college has
been recognized by all. and the
hope has been freely expressed
that the trustees would soon find
a man suitable for the place,
The result of their labors is tountl
in the election of Dr. Bradley. to
whom the whole college will ex-
tend a cordial welcome. Iieconles
