The Imp.

The long looked for Annual is
here atlast. The]uniorboard,gay»
ly ensconsed in a conspicuously
be-ribboned and be»bannered lane
dau, made the rounds Monday ate
ternoon—only two days behind
schedule time, a really remarkable
record for an Annualiand with
considerable ceremony, delivered
the goody. Dollars were fairly
thrown at the board, such was the
eager haste of the subscribers to
get their money’s worth and of
the victims to learn their fate,
The ﬁrst thing which greeted the
eye of the purchaser, was a mod-
estly diabolical representation up
on a red cover. The front page

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

 

”consigns the Imp” to "PICMC
Gatsie." and the second page im'
parts the iiiiorrnatioii that a sense’
oi humor, not malign intent, is
the propelling tor-cc or thc ideas
pictorrauy and otherwise present-
ed, This introductory explains
tion will certainly be a comfort to
some of the “victims.”

The evident aim of the board
was to emphasize the lighter vein
of college lite. Little space was
devoted to athletics, a subject al-
ways fullof interest to both stus
dents and alumni, and none at all
to other organizations beyond a
few pictures. A play occupies
the ﬁrst portion of the book; then
tollows views or the campus, ath»
letic teams and Glee Club intcrs
sprinkled with humoroussketches,
“Dramatics,” giving scenes rrorn
recent plays, ﬁlls thelater portion,
As can be easily seen, time and
labor were mainly devoted to de
veloping all the funny things
which have happened during the
past two years. These funny
things can be more easily seen
than described.

While “The Imp” is not as am
bitious in its aims as past Annuals
have been, neither can it be placed
on the same level with them in
quality of work. The fault
lies in great measure with
thc cartoonist. A good cartoon
ist should sci: tiporr the peculiarr
ities of each individual, alld so cm-
phasizc them that there could be
no mistake in identity. Such is
not the case withthc present pubs
lication. However, it should be
remembered that the difﬁculties
in getting out a successtul work of
this kind are legion in number,
and that the present work is a re»
sult of hard, faithful service on
the part of the Annual Board.

Obituary.

Mrs. Sarah C. Parker, wife of
Professor L. 17. Parker, passed
peacefully from this life into the
higher and better life, on Tuesday,
about 2:30 r. in. Mrs. Parker was
the ﬁrst lady principal of Iowa
College, and for a number oi years
was an example as well as ateachs
erof all that goes to make up love-
ly, cultured christian womanhood.
Her whole life was a beautiful ben-
efaction as well as benediction to
all that knew her. She was a true

Mr. Campbell’s Lecture.

Mr. C. Campbell, who has
served for souie years the
board or public uork, Dcs
Moiries gave an eariiest,intelligcnt
address on Monday evening, to a
number oi students and taculty
who are interested in the pressing
social questions that are today de:

In part he sat : Men cart rcn~
der no greater service to their
time than the study and spread of
the truth as pertaining to our
great social questions, and espec-
ially is this true as regards our
municipal affair . The tensity of
life, the centrali .ation of industry
and capital, makes the city the
center and opportunity for rilcgie
mate power to assert itsclt. To
day the cities iii our cotintry are
all undergoing experis
cnccs, cndeavoring to work out
the best methods, but having no
pertectcd American system to fol»
low, they are ﬂoundering in difﬁ»
cultics. The call is for men who
are competent and public spirited
to enter into the ﬁeld of public
service in our municipal political
life, and build the city govern.

ing, upon permanent and scicntihc
foundations,

When we remember that in l300
only about 4 per cent. or our peo-
ple lived in urban centers or over
8,000 and today the city claims
30 per cent. of the United States,
the immensity of the situation
dawns upon.us. It practically
means that the success or failure
of oiir city governments saves or
doolns our national life.

The ﬁrst thing that meets the
reformer-is the cry/“Heavy Taxes.”
