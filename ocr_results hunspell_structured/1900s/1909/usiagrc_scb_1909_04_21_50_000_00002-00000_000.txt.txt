THE DEBATE SITUATION
Grinliell's debating history this year

has not been an unsucce'ssful one. It

is not'thererore with any lock or no
preciation of the men who did debate

that the thought impresses itseli: How
inﬁnitely more successrul might the
season have been had all the men in
the College or proven dehhtlng ability
been contestants tor the College teams?
Such a result can only be obtained or
making the intersociety contests, once
more, as the) were in the past, prelilnlv
nary to the College debates. This
change would produce results decided»
ly beneﬁcial in their ndtlll‘e.

At present we hare the society and
College debates on dilterent questions
and so arranged as to bring to the
debater almost ineritnblr a choice he.
tneen representing llls College or his
soeie it he chooses to attempt both.
such a diiisiou oi his time is net-es
Sul)’ as to eircctuallr preclude the pos
sibilitr oi success in either,

The tern as no had it in the past
enabled the College tleltmel' to cunt a
greater amount of time and enoit on
his question and hare g. deeper ac.
quaintance with it, liorc important, li
gave him a knowledge or ille strong
and weak points oi his on stion gained
in actual combat on the hour.

it is a mooted question whether the
present system has developed our more
men to prohcienci in donating than
nus tlie case or the old system. lt
cannot be disputed. lionerer, that those
n ho hare been dereloped have not been
dercloped nearly as thoronehlr as was
the case In prcrious years, That the
system was not productive or cwoep
tional success when tried prcrionsly,
can be traced more directly to the aha
solute‘ apathy nhich existed at that
time than to the sistem itseii.

We are not iniormed as to what
difﬁculties in the way of agreements
and compacts stand in the war oi such
a change, hut it it is at all possible
we heliere that with the increased in.
terest which manilested itseli this
year, the nest interests or the college,

or the societies and, or the individual

debaters demand a return to the old
system whereby the scclety debates
constitute the preliminaries tor the
’varsity teams.

A COMMUNICATION.

The notice or the Glee Club concert

seemed hardly the place {or “jars" and
“stangs” but there is one legitimate
complaint that it seems to me ought to

The concert was advertised to begin
at both 3:00 and 8:1o, though the for-
mer hour ls Cermlnly lthe enough for
a concert which is certain to he a long
