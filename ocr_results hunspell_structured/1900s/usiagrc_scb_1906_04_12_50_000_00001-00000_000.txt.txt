OUR ATHLETICS,

Grinnell's General Ouilook Good,
Some or ill: Hopes and Needs or
Ih: Pressm Season.

Although [he Cinders ha\e been llyr
ing for several days and Lhe diamond
is 7). place of unusual acti icy e\ery
afternoon, it is still too early to make
it reliable ”dope” on many of [he ath-
ietic events With which the Spring
term is ﬁlled, Tl c things Within iln~
mediate sight are the hom meets and
possibly the Drake dual, but way on
there in May a big audir which takes
place at Des Moines looms up as the
ﬁnal thing to be aimed c or course
we’ve got our chance. Itmay be
the chance of the iarmerln the shell
game, but as long as there is a ghost
Of a Show everybody Works hard to
make the long cherished state cham-
pionship a reality. At. least, Grinnell
is still in the Big Four as hard as any-
body.

But it is these daily workouts 0n
the track and the trials in the pre'
liminary meets which ﬁnally deter‘
mine our chance. If faithfulness will
do anything we can count on some»
thing of a now anyway. Last year
took away some of our men but the
present season brings more to take
their places. Many new men are out
and several are showing good form,
Davis in the weights is doing well;
Tlunnipnn, Munson, McIntosh, Hair
and others are doing good work in
their respective events. In the
jumps we are still without a star,
though by the return of Slaght this
year we may ho‘pelor at least as much
a usual. Huff, Glow. Boyd, Dawson,
Marvin, Deﬂaan and Jaqua are a few
of the old stand-by: who can be count-
ed on to do their stunts, and several
others, of Lhe old linen, are following
close alter the lezders.

In baseball even more new men
have shown a deSlre to make ‘Varsrty,
and there will be some warm Competi-
tion for places in the mine. But few
of the old men havea sure hold on
their positions.

Just now the great demand is that
we moire sure the ﬁnancial success or
our season. For some time opportuni
ty has been ocered to get‘a season
ticket at an absurdly low price. For
eiplit events, at least :3 ve of winch are
highly important in the season's
schedule only Fol 50 :5 re Jireil film
will promise to take tickets. Asyet
the number is far short of that re
nuirerl. one complaint being that the
girls have not shoml a d ~etohure
their share in the seasons benelils.
They might at least llelp urge the
other sex to do their duty toward the
athletic management. If the required
number is notsigned before [he ﬁrst
ball game Wlllch takes place with Cue

tnniiy.wlll be gone. Sign pow.

ﬁLm‘ge Audience Present.

Another bond was added last night
to the many which already unite the
town of Grinnell with Iowa College,
for the Colonial theatre was filled with I
on attentive and appreciative audir
ence in which townspeople were quite
as conspicuous and interested as the
students of the college. These two ele-
ments were one in their friendly titti-
tude toward the affair and their hope
for its success. A representative citi-
zen had olrei-ed n generous reward for
the speaker who could present a sub
ject most forcefully and impressively,
and his fellow~towllsmen were as anx-
ions as the fellow-students or the
speakers to see that the price Wits just-
ly awarded.

By eight o'clock nearly all were seat-
ed and Prof. Ryan, as representing
the Public Speaking Department of
the College, presented the Chairman or
the evening, Mayor R. G. Coutts.
This gentleman, in a few sensible
words, stated the origin and purpose
of the event, with zfew words ofpraise
for the one who made it possible, and
for the idea he had in View. The new
and laudable custom or a prompt be-
ginning, and closed doors [luring the
presentation of each number, was
again enforced, and the ﬁrst contest
{or the Spaulding Prize in Public
Speaking had begun. The order of
exercises was as follows:

A slight lnallllel'ism in this gentler

 

man’silLtiturlc was more than billilm‘cd
by his directness and lame, and b;. his

excellent bearing on the stage. A good
oration was looked for by all from Mr.
Whedtonmnd no one was disappointed.
His voice and his control of himself
made him :1 fr rite with many. An
agreeable dignity und repose alman-
ner made Mr, Goy's speaking attrac-
tive. The good tastelle used in timing
his pauses and lay-inn empllhsrs pro-
duced a very eflectlve impression. His
method was eiliclcnt in that it drew
attention to the subject itselfr An-
other goorl mice well inﬂected and
mnoaged gave Tllr, thon a good
working basis. Although his carriage
rather lacked control at times, his
earnestness made his theme an im-
portunt element in his speaking, and
the straightforward forcefulness of his
delivery compelled attention. A de-
cided change in style and in subject
furnished a marked advantage {or Mr
Garner. The contrast between Savou-
arola and his times, and the present
day topics or the other speakers came
at a point when this orator's ability
had its greatest erect. The excellence
of his vocal apparatus helps account
for his success. but it was always un-
der control and used with good judg-
ment to the best ad vantage, The last
speaker was Mr, Quarton, whose in»
tense sincerity was his chief point of
excellence. He produced an appeal
which was felt as being a. part of the
speaker himself, and which showed
ability to interest an audience. On
the whole, from the point of View of
eﬂ‘ective and sincere presentation the
program was nhuge success. Ability
has been shown which gives promise
of greater things to be achieved in
this linelater, Although notprirnarily
a contest to Show thinking ability, yet
impressive presentation requires good
judgment and thoughtful consider
ation of what is in the best taste and
of what will be [he most forceful mans

OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE.

Summary ofWork oi Young Men’s Chris~
lian Association for Year Ending
April 14. 1905,

A very small part or the actual re-

sults Mil year’s Workin lmy activity of
school lile can not be measured by the
figures it has to show and in no phase
of the work is this more cpparentthan
in Christian work, especially as itis
carried on by associations which seek
not results measured by ﬂ, ures but in
actual development of Christian char-
acter. True as [his is We cannotover—
look the great amount or work neces»
sary to the successful Carrying through
of a year‘s activities in association
life even in a college like Grinnell
with such high religious and moral
standards, Some roots regarding the
size and development of the diil‘el'ent
departments otwork ought not to be
outoi place, however, as the yenr is
nearly lit a close and although there is
reason to feel gratiﬁed at the growth
in some departments, no one realizes
more keenly than the men in the 3.54
sociotion whererthey have 'ni_l.7t.\, in
other departments. Perhaps the de-
partment of association work which
appears most fruitful and touches vi-
tally the life of must students is the
Bible study department. This year
there have been enrolled about one
hundred and twenty men in thirteen
classes under leaders thoroughly fam-
iliar with the work under their charge.
with One exception these have been
students leader. Tile Bible study is
systematic and the courses compre-
hensive, covering thoroughly periods
in tlic 0k] nndNeWTestaments and de-
signed to ﬁllthe needs Ofstudents [ram
ﬁrst to fourth year work, There can
belittle doubt that Bible Study has
been over one or the eiiective deport~
merits of association uork.

Luck of organization, not lack of en-
thusism has characterized the mis-
sionury department and because of
this there has been felt. keenly the
