THE UNIT.

First issue Appears Today in New and
Attractive FormiPlans tor
the Year.

In the history of the college
literary magazine in Iowa College
the chiet problem has been to
arouse an active interest on the
part of students not directly con-
nected with the board of editors.

In years past the complaint has
been made that the same contrib-
utors have appeared in Mr Um
month after month and that these
contributors were most oltcn from
the board itself. The fact quite
escaped many students that this
was not the normal condition nor
the one sought and that the reinee
dy lay in their own hands.

The U1IiliS a college institution,
the representative of the literary
spirit of the college, and this spire
it cannot be adequately reﬂected
by ten persons alone.

It is as desirable that the liter
ary life at Grinnell should be ex-
pressed with enthusiasm as that
the religious and athletic life
should be, and it must be done in
the same way. by doing the bcsi
that we can do now, in the hope
that ive may find our strength in.
creasing with each effort.

If every student who has ever
teit the prompiiiigs of an impulse
to write will do his best this year
with the thought that he is need
ed. Ill;- [/izzt must inevitably be a
magazine of which we may all be
proud.

The ﬁrst issue tor this year ap.

pears today with a new cover. The
shape is somewhat changed and
the inside printed on a ﬁne white
paper which adds mateiially to
the attractiveness of the magazine.
These changes and improvements
have been made in the ﬁrm belief
that they were needed and would
be appreciated by thestudcnts and
alumni or lowa College, Necese
saiily there has been considerable
added expense in making the im-
provements. it you approve of
the efforts of the management to
give Iowa College a magazine to
be proud of, show your appreci-
ation in a substaiici’al way by sub-
scribing. The First number will
be sent you free. Before the next
issue your subscription will he
solicited by the Bus. Mgr, L. F.
Meade. or his assistant Mr. Earle
Brundage. The subscription rates
are BLOC per 'year if paid before
February I. 3125 if paid after
that date.
