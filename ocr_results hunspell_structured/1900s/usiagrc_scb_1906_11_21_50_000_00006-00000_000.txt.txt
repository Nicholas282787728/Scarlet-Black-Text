A big stag dinner is planned ior
Thanksgiving evening and the girls of
the institution who expect (0 remain
over the recess will also participate in
El. social function that evening. Now
by all Just-ice and logic it would seem
that. the Drowning event of tlie week
should be a combination aliaii' for
Friday _and saturday evening. The
faculty are Willing to do their share
toward making it a success and the
prospects for a jolly good time at an
informal party of this kind are very
bright. The new people who will be
hereneed it and we all will enjoy it.
Think it over.

President Main led chapel yesteb
day morning, his talk being suggested
by his recent eastern trip. President
Blair) was an interested spectator at
the Dartmouthﬂarvard game and
gave it as his Opinion that, While the
new rules have improved the chances
of a light team, the heavy team Still
has an undue advantage, and foot ball
can never be a good college game
while the scales can go so iar toward
determining the result. Fundament-
ally the revolution in the rules was to
make the game clearer, more ethical,
more honest. Dishonesty was to be
made unproﬁtable. High ideals
should rule in college it nowhere else.
Athletic scores and grades in studies
must be honestly won. The price of
deceit is too great. The problem or
life is between yourself and no one
Cln compel you to do right. Reason
and not compulsion mush rule. The
mastery must be obedience to the
best Within you. Tile Faculty can-
not Stop cheating but the students

can.

lellowship of the trees and the minis-

growing into unconscious triendliness

tunity or College days. How I rejoice
with you in the chapel. They tell me
it is beautiiul. The Annual once
laughed at the chapel dream. If it
brings the boys and girls to like God,
it will be worth more than all the
other buildings put together,

Well, this letter is too long already

There are none ﬁner on the planet.
