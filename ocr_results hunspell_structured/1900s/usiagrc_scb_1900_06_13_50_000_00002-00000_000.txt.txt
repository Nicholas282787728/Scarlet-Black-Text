disciples. rhe only obyetl oi this ser»
man today is to try to help us to see the
same vision and to beat his call.

Let us conic now to a little closer and
sharper thought Take the two words i
turn; ﬁrst, “Trust." That Is agrcnt act
that is asked of us. \Vc shall (lo well to
stand up in the dignity oi our intellectual
maturity and say, “l can not accept the
invitation to place the fundamental cone
ﬁdence of my life anywhere and do it
lightly." it is a serious thing that is
asked of me when my conﬁdence is
sought. And what a conﬁdence is tliis'
We are asked to trust all of life with its
mighty interests; all ideals which the
soul oi prophet or poet or philosopherhas
ever seen; the whole siveep and range of
the human soul. Man. who “rolled the
psalm to tvintry sky;" man, nature's last
and grentestwork; man, capable ofihillkr
ing God's thoughts aiter him, capable oi
entering into the ieelings and plans oi
God; man, who reaches with telescope
and microscope iar out anti iar down into
the measureless universe of which we are
a part; man is asked to surrenderl Here
comes a voice which asks us, whose mind
and spirit are in the very image oi God,
to give up all in conﬁdence, to entrust
ourselves with all our ideals and all the
range oi our thought, to something or
some one, it is a great surrender that is
asked of us and we will not yield our con-
ﬁdence lightly.

Nay, the call is beyond tha we are
asked to trust God not only in life but in
death, not only for the present but for all
the future; trust him for the hope of im-
mortalityl Has this world and this uni-
verse any interest for us when the breath
stops and the heart beats no longer? A
call to trust if it be universal, must min-
ister to us at this point and must verily
have in it power “to bring life and im-
mortality to lIght,"—or it will fail us just
when and where we need it most. 30

well did jesus know that, that more than
once, not only in word but in act, did he
build solid foundation of conﬁdence for

us while he was bodily with us. He
healed the sick, he raised the centurion's
daughter and the widow's son, and his
iricnd, Lazarus, irom the dead back into
liie again, just to show they were not dead
as we count dead, but only sleeping,
Then seeming to realize the natural and
periectly legitimate skepticism oi honest
and earnest men, to crown all, he said to
his disciplesiKill even me and I will
rise again and meet you yonder in Gal.

thoughtiul man to believe that he did
those deeds and kept that promise, To
the superﬁcial mind or the childish, t is
easy to believe most anything, any sort oi

thoughtiul and mature and strong soul,
it is a great thing that is asked oi us when
we are asked to trust God ior immortalr

terly commonplace. Somehow it nap.

has convinced the most thoughtiul oi
mankind oi immortality, except the voice

on earth do have conﬁdence when he

ness which has come into our lives be-
cause we have listened to this call, All
the ages oi record are lull oi testimony
irom the purest souls and greatest, and

 

from the sanest minds, testimony to the
power oi the peace oi this conﬁdence.
To trust is to hope. To trust is to have

conﬁdence in the fundamental and nbld~
ing value of human life; that it has foun-
dations that will outlast time and ourr
reach space, such conﬁdence is necessary
if we would make our lives wolth while,

not beastly but are, far below any depths
oi iniamy any beast can ever achieve;-
all this disaster and woe of sin and devV
astation of life, roots back into funda-
mental lack of conﬁdence. \Vhen men
and women have lost that, then what do
they care? “Do the next thing," what-
ever the dictates oi fashion or prejudice
or whim or mere inertia oi laziness may
call forth. All is the result of lack of
conﬁdence, Crime and sin and large
opportunity or bittcr wrong and woe oi
human life, in the individual and. in the
nations, is because men do not trust God.

To this abysmal need, which seems so
great that it almost ought to weight
down the earth as it swings in its course,
the voice of Jesus calls, Trust God. So
great is the call, so great is the act to
which it calls. It is the very sublimity
of fail/t, whose vital essence is trust.and
conﬁdence, that concerns us as we listen
to this word. It is no light t g, for it is
our life. \Ve are dealing here with the
very ioundations oi the universe in rela
tion to our lives. it there is a great call
that can enter the soul of man, here it is.
It there is a great act to which any voice
can call us, we have to do with it here as
Jesus bids us, Trust God.

If then the act to which we are hidden
is so great, correspondingly great then
must be that in which we are hidden to
put our trust. Vi’hat is that? The name
that is given to it is God. And what is
God that we should trusthim? \Ve have
not seen him with the eye, We have
not touched him with the hand. By no
sense oi our physical nature have we
perceived him or come in contact with
him. Who, what is God that we should
trust him?

or course we realize how poor and in-
adequate our idea at God must be, We
little humans do not know much at the
best. ltis no wonder that the ancient
iews had it as part oi their religion that
the name oi God should never be spok-
en. with such reverence was the thought
of God surrounded. Yet this is true;
“The foundation of any one's religion,
and therefore of his behavior is his idea
oi God. Nothing can bemove important
for us than to have our fundamental
idea true. At best, as but developing
souls still very immature, we shall not
have it complete or pcricct or iully realr
ized in our consciousness; it may, hm .
ever, be true so far as it goes. it it is
false, we are worshiping an idolr Idola»

 

ters,inrlanger oi being morally shrlv-
cllcd by their devotions, are not only
people who bow down to pictures and
graven images; thev arctheuiuch larger
class who believe in, as God, what is only
the creature oi their own imagination."

As the mind of man matures with the
passing centuries, there comes to us an
ever larger conception oi God. in the
carlyycars oi which the ﬁrst historical
records give ils an account, in the Cl’llld-
hood of the world, men thought of God
in a chilrlrlike way, sometimes even a
childish way. The early pages oi the
Old Testament are full of such views.
They are true enough in their religious
and moral essence, but utterly crudc in
theirlorm oi statement. For example,
it is said that a report had reached God
of how men were acting in certain cities
and that God said: "I will godown now
and see whether this report is altogether
title which has come up to me." Now
that thought is true enough so iar as the
ethical or religious teaching of the Bible
is concerned; but we all recognize it as
expressedin such terms as mere chil.
dren in thotrght would use.

From aiisources oi human study, oi
human research in laboratory, in the
philosophers room, in the study, even oi
the hours of devotion and meditation, is
comrngawidcr thought oi God. Even
the physical sciences that have to do
with what we call matter, Chemistry, Ei-
ology, Physics, have in these later years
given its much that is new and much
that is helpfully truein our thought oi
what the underlying facts and forces in
the universe are. Even from out these
laboratories has been growing clearly on
our listening ears the voice that pro
claims that there is One Great Origin,
The same voice is telling us that all
forces that we know are one. Every
kind of activity, every kind of force, ev-
ery phenomenon apprehensible to our
ﬁve senses is coming to be possibly rc-
duccd to one ultimate force. That force
is not matter, nor are its analogies found
in matter. That ultimate source of all
activity is spirit and the analogies under
which we must think of tall force are
more like the terms in which we attempt
to deﬁne and analyze spirit. Philosophy
at its best has long maintained that we
know no lorce but the force of
intelligent. conscious, sensible Will.
There is an ever increasing con-
ﬁdence in the strongest thinkers
of the world that all that is, is one, and
its name is God. This is not pantheism,
That which distinguishes pnntheism
irom the modern Christian conception oi
God is the one fundamental fact of per-
sonality. Christian theism, with all that
modern science and philosophy can
bring to it, still conceives of God asi r
telligence, feeling and will. As long as
we hold fast to this truth: that "persons
ality is the ultimate iact in thought and
1ife”we need have no ienr oi being just-
ly chargcdwith relapsing into the old
heathenism that is called pantheism,
That doctrine is that all that is and all
that happens sums itself up into God;
but thut there is no thought and heart
and will as the source and eternally shap.
ing iorce oi all that is,

The larger we can make our concep-
tion of God, and the more nearly all i ,
clusive we can make it, the nearer to us
shall we think of him. “Closer is be
than breathing, and nearer than hands
and feet." Our spirits, mere human
ones, strive to get near each other in
friendship and affection, but there is air
ways a ieeling that there is an ultimate
barrier and that each must somehow live
hislile alone, Of course that is true.
But there are few reverent souls that do
not recognize that it is possible for us
consciously to live nearer to God than to

 

any human friend, We reach each other
and are in communion with each other
through touch and look and sound of
voice. Yet we are apart. hutwith God
there is no need of any of these methods
of communication. We believe that we
may know him directly, not merely by
studying hirn, learning his waysin na~
ture, in history, In hie, in the moving
current oi experiences; but we may know
him directly. “Speak to Him, thou, for
He hears. and Spirit with Spirit can
meet. Yes. and spirit can meet with
spirit withoutspeaking. Why should it be
thought a thing wonderitil that there
may be many other and more direct
means oi communion between spirit and
spirit than by the clumsy, unreliable,
often mistaken avenues and methods of
the physical senses. We need not allow
thrs conception to lead us oli into the
vagaries oi mysti ism and spiritualism
and all that, and all that. We may rest
content in the simple faith that the spirit
world is near to us and that we may re»
ccivea niiuistry from God and what mes-
sengers oi spirit he may choose to use,
so that our lives may be lived in an at-
mospherc that is all divine, As we learn
more and more of the universal imniar
nence oi spirit, oi the indwelling oi God;
as we more and more conceive that there
is nothing outside God, there Is no real-
ity but is a part oiGod, that we ourselves
are htit parts oi him; in other words, as
we enlarge by broadening and elevating
and deepening otir conception oi what
God the all-informing spirit is, so shall
we grow more to apprcciate the founda-
tion on which may be builded the right
to bid us to Trust God. He is so inﬁn-
itely more than we poor little humans
can conceive that we ought not to be
afraid to trust him. Indeed. the only
fear we ought to cherish is the fear
not to trust him, At what inﬁnite pains
he has been to leach us that he is our
friend! Human life il it can only be
ﬁlled with sweet trust is rich and beautie
ful, More than that, it may be restful,
Not restful in the sense of doing nothing,
The peace of God does not make lan-
guid, it energizes. We may work all the
harder, all the more cdectively because
we believe that our work shall not he in
vain. The Kingdom of God is coming
on earth not without us, but by means of
what men can do to bring it in. God
and man corwork to the highest ends.

To the youthful reformer the world
must be set right by tomorrow morning.
But experience and maturity, ay, and
knowledge oi God and his ways, lead to
a more restiul patience. How slow and
hard has been the growth which the race
has already attainedl And it has as yet
only started 'n its course. The best oi
modern ci zation compared to the
crudcness oi the savage seems to usgreat.
But every present achievement oi the hu-
man race is immeasurably below savage
ery compared with the iull coming oi the
Kingdom oi God that is yet to be upon
the earth. In the foothills yet are we,
the clear air oi the mountain tops is yet
iarther beyond us than we are above the
low plains of the lowest human life we
know. ,So, tor the great social reforms,
the largest realm oi human gain yet
dawned on the dream and hope of those
who can sce,7for this too, hear Jesus,
and trust God.

So the'call to trust God istohelieve that
in Him as a part of himself, is all force,
all spirit, all intelligcnce, all law, all life.
“We do not think of God 25 an architect
on a sublime scale, or world-builder, We
do not think of him as an astronomical
clockrmaker constructing a vast time-
piece of stars and planets outside Him-
self." We think of all these things as part
of Himself, as he is unfolding Himself
into progressive maniiestation. There
