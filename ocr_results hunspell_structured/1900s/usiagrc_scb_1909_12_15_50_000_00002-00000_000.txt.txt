A COLLEGE SONG.

At last the College has a song which
seems to answer the requirements in
being a typical expression or the best
in Grinnell life and iurtlier a song
which is suitahle ror all occasions
This song will rill a long felt want in
the stlldcnt life or the College and too
much credit cannot lle given Norman
Hall, who has embodied in both the
words and music or this song. a spilli
that is typically Grinnell,

MUSIC.

within the tulle of the upper-cl
men in Grinnell there has come ahoul
a great change in the interest ot the
student body at large in the musical
entertainments oifercd hy the School
of Music. In place of small audicnces
or musical specialist of a few yca -
ago, practically the entire student had;
attend all the special entertainments
offered. So tar as the College at lar .
is concerned, music has hecome pupur
lsrizcd and for this tact Director
Pierce is to he thanhed, He has suc-
eeeded in interesting the studenrs Di
the College who know little or nothing
or the technical side of ruusic in thc
wonderful possihili es in it ior help
in] and enjoyable eiltermilllllcnt a
new appreciation of the contribution
that music can make to our lire has
been gained and every one is the het-
ter for it. The opportunity to hcar a
great orator-lo line the liessiah or to
listen to some of the great artists rhal
have come to Grinncll in the last three
years is one thot comes hut once (on
most of us. Because of the interest =n
these productions and hecause or th
tact that they have heen made nos»
slide again we aant to express our ape
prcciatiou for what Mr. Pierce has-
done tor students at GI llell.

MDRFIAKOU FOOTBALL.

We are very glad to puhiish a slate
ment lronl President Jordan oi Leland
Stanford University which appeared in
yesterday's Record iierald relative to
the change which was made in Cali»
fornia some years ago and the success
which has attended this experimcnr
The step taken by these institutions
is possihlc among the colleges of ion-a
named in the last issue of Scarlet and
Black. while in that issue we named
the soccer game as a good one to sun-
stitute for the present game, practi-
cally any of the forms mentioned in
another column of this paper would
prove worthy of an experiment.

But whatever step that is taken, on.
islands deiinite concerted action and
now is the time for that action.

leges, holicres that a return to the
English sport would he heneiicial to
all. “I am rumualiiiedly opposed to
the game as now played in the eastern
colleges. Essential erils lie in the tact
that it is a hatlln, not a sport, directed
not by the players, but by outside
coaches who malre tame and iortuuc
by winning games.

“Tile remedy for mos oi the evils or
present toothnll is \‘e g slmplc. liahc
it a sport again. Repeal the regill't-
tion mahing legitimate ‘oiﬂside piay,‘
or ‘illtel-iel‘eilcn,‘ which necessitates
‘nlnss play.’

“Do this and “e shall have in sun-
slance the Rughr game, irom which
the American game was over tlvelitl’

During thc past two or three irechs
tlle duestion of the recognition or non

The rcsult of this seems to he that
there is an almost unanimous opinion

what action should he taken there is
not such an unanimity or agreement.
Some would have dancing on the corn-

College; others would allow dances to

be held in some or the halls down '

town under proper supervision, while
others are for giving them up entirely,
