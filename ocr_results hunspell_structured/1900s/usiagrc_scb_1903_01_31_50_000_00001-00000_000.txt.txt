THE SPANISH GYPSY.

Play by the Dramatic club Given Sues
cessfully at the Lolonial.

The production of the Dramatic
Club play last evening was an-
other evidence of what hard work
will accomplish. From the rise
of the curtain to the end of the
last scene the work of the cast
showed that the most faithful
work had been done in prepara-
tion, One of the parts whose suc
cess or failure often meansthe suc»
cess or failure of the play, the
opcning scene, was very well
carried out and foretold the skill-
ful work which followed, The
dance in thc public square was
one of the pleasing parts of the
play, giving avaricty of color and
movement which was very ef
fective,

A5 Fedalma, Miss Smith found
herself at home in the character
and Carried the heroinc's part well,
being the strongest member of the
cast. Miss Holden, as Don Silva,
showed the weakness of a woman
in strong male parts. A noticeable
feature all through was the
strength of those who were play.
ing the minor parts. In amateur
productions the minor players are
often strongsr than in proicssional
casts and this was certainly true
last evening. These parts were
played with a spirit and error
which was surprising in inexperi~
enced players, and added very
much to the strength of the play
as a whole. Geo. F. Richardson,
as Father Isidor, was especially
good and one the strongest scenes
in the play was that where the
old inquisitor forms his resolution
to imprison Fedalma and prays
tor strength to accomplish good
for the holy church. Leonard
Carney, as Sephardo, the astrolo
gcr, also carricd his part withgood
effect.

The attendance was all that
could be expected and every
available seat in the house was
ﬁlled. The Dramatic Club has
won only a falr success in the way
in which the play was dramatized
but the cast was .well chosen and
the final production well carried
out,the work done by LF. Meade,
thc stage manager, who was also
business manager for the club,

was excellent.
