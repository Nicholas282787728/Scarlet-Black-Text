THE ACADEMY PRELXMINARY
DEBATE

on Tuesday evening, in Insti-
ttite Hall, occurred the annual
preliminary debate of the Lewis
Literary Society, to select speak-
ers for their outside debate, which
will probably be with Penn Acadr
cmy.

The question discussed was con
cerning the dangers arising from
organized labor and capital. Six
speakers entered the contest and,
with one cxccption,all spoke irom
the negative standpoint.

The contestants appcared to
have a ﬁrm grasp on their subject
and presented their arguments in
very good shape

The judges were: MissMillerd,
Prdlessor Macy, Pretessor Horn,
E. 14‘. Denison, '03. and G. 0. Ar
nold, '03. The following men were
chosen by the judges: G. c. Van
Wormer, H.I.Worth and William
Cochran, with E. J. iacqua as
alternate.

The team chosen is undoubtedly
as strong as any tllat has reprev
sented the society, and will win
iurther honor tor the organization.

Mr. Van Wormcr is a new man.
but\vithsometrainingwill become
an effective dcbatcr, Both Worth
and Cochran have had considerar
blc experience and have proveu
themselves capable at all times.

Although this debate was open
to the public. only a small numr
her outside of the society were
present. The academy students
especially should support the so-
ciety in better shape, and there
should be more interest taken in
this kind of workin order to make
it successful.

Miss Blaisdell favored the society
with two solos. which were well

received.

THE BASKET BALL GAMES.

Brisket ball enthusiasm in Grins
nell reached its climax on Satur-

 

day last when on thc local court
the Seniors dcfcatcd the Sopho—
mores by a score of 199 and the
Freshmen dereated the Juniors by
iz—ii. No four teams could be
more evenly matched and the in-
terest was intense from start to
ﬁnish. A fair sized audience was
presentand the gymnasium \vas
neatly decorated with class colors
and emblems. In the Seniors
Sophomore game. the playing was
rough and unsteady, although the
Sophomores showed the results of
harder practice. An idea of the
game can be obtained by the
number of fouls made by each
team. nine being called on the
sophomores and tourteen on the
Seniors.

The Junior— Freshman game
has been pronounced one of the

grounds. The two teams were in
excellent tom and the showing
made by the Freshmen was a sur-
prise to all. The Juniors, who
have held the Championship tor
two years and who were again con»
ceded victory, were unable to with
stand the ﬁerce playing and learn
work of the Freshman. Wilder
and G. 6- Wilson both played a
strong game, the latter saving the
day (or the Freshmen by a ﬁne
throw for basket toward the end
of the second half. The champion-
ship game between the Freshmen
and Seniors will be played Thursr
day aiternoon at 4:45 o'clock.
