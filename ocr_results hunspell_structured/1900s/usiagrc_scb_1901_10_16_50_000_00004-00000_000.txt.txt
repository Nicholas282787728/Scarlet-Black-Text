A STATEMENT FROM DR. KNIFE.

The following statement, as
quoted in the Daily Iowan was
made by Coach Knipe after the
Iowa Drake game last Fiidayie
“I congratulate Coach Best and
his team veiy sincerely on the
good tootoall the Drake men
played yesterday. I will say,
however, that I have never been
in a town wherel was so badly
used as in Des Moines yesterday.
It was not because of the spirit of
Coach Best and his men for they
did all they could to do the right
thing. Takingintuconsideiation,
the happenings in Des Moincs
Saturday, and the behavior on
the side lines yesterday and the
insults that were addressed to me,
lsay, that this conduct does not
come very well truni a college
that calls itselta University, but
ham 3 college that is suffering
lroni a lack of what is manly and
fair and spot‘tsrnanillte,”
