debaters did work of which all of
us maybe proticl. Each one of
them put [olth a higher order ol
debating than Grinnell people
had cvet belol'c heard from him.
The improvement in Mr. Brown
was especially marked and it may
besafcly said that in manner at

plattorm the Grltmcll men were
superior to their oppmerits,a (act

suffer defeat at the hands of such
as they, nor can anything but
unstinted credit be given to the
men who have beaten Paul,Weber
and Brown.
