The annual commencement concert
was given Saturday night in Herr ,lt
chapel. This year the exercises co'n-
sisled ot a joint program by the Girl
Glee Club and the lowa College oi»
cthll‘a. both new adlllliolii to the
circle oi college activities and the
program was a success in every r!»
opt-ct

The numbers by the Girls‘ tilcc
Cluh were well chosen, pleasing and
well sung. the only possible adve
criticism being that a lack oi e
perlencc in unison work such as int.
he evpected in so new an organizer
tion was maniiested.

The orchestra phi. d at its best
and was decidedly popular but neces-
sarily suiieved by comparison with
the Thomas orchestra which Crinnell
people had heat-d so recently. Four
numbers were pl‘ -ed. all oi which
relieeted great credit on the orchestra
and their leader, Froi, G. L. Pierce.

Miss Ema Suckow sang two solos.
"Bonjcllr Suzanne" and “The Hills oi
Skye.“ in which her clear soprano
voice was heard to great advantage.
Two piano solos trom Cliopiu were
played by Miss Sarah MacDonald, one
or which was the beautiiul “Noc-
tl‘trne."

The concert was a great success
and the audience a pleased and de-
lighted one, and both clubs give prom»

immediately aiter the picnic the
alumni and alumnae adjourned to the
Y. W. c, A. auditorium where the
annual business meeting oi the asso-
ciations was held. There was an ey-
ceptionally large attendance, due no
doubt to the interest which has been
'avoused in the election or alumni
trustee. For this oilice there were
three nominees, H. w. Hughes, ’92;
J. F. Dar .. 9:, and .i. P, Clyde, '94.
oi which the latter was elected by a
close vote.

Aiter this election plans tor rais—
ing a part ot' the endowment land
were discussed and a great deal oi
enthusiasm was maniiested in this.
As a result a coinmlttee was nillloint»
ed to cooperate with the trustees in
such action.

ilr, Arthur C. llccill oi the institute,
who delivered a periectly constructed
speech on the tendency to centi-
cation in our government. Aside train
the clear and logical construction oi
his speech, MT. ichill easily eclipsed
the other contestants in the iinency
and variety ol his diction and evident
lainiliavity with the subject he had
chosen. Mr. Clean Kinsl . oi Chi-es-
toinathian, in a speech on Restricted
”immigration,” used an earnest iorcc,
and the inﬂuence ot a strong person-
ali ~ to such eit'ect that he was graded
equally with Mr. ichill, being given
second place because ot a slightly
lower percentage. Miss i-ielen Dull~
ham was given third honors tor a
speech on the ideal teacher. Miss
Dunbaiu's delivery was simple, clear,
deioid oi :tl'l'eclatimi and unusually
pleasing as to manner and voice.

The other speakers were iliss
noove ot the Philadelphica who spoke
on a problem at immigration. Juliet
Buckley, who represented Ellis with
much iorce and originality oi delivery
on the subject "The Greatest Need ot'
low-a College. and \lr. .loseph Brody
ot' the For in who set lorth his views
on The Control at the Saloon," with
considerable skill.

The singing contest was judged by
airs. E B. Scheve. iii-s. Clara Hencr
Schoultz, and \lrs \l, H. Douglass,
who awarded ﬁrst p e to iiiss ,le
Dodd and second to .\lr, David Pech.
There was more llisdgi‘eelllent m the
audience as to the outcome oi the
singing contest than that ol- the speaks
lug. each singer being in the main
accurate and almost equally pleasing,
The choice oi songs was a bit un-
iortmiate in being rather ol the same
general stileillellehding almost ens
tire ~ on the nuict, subdued etlects
rather than brightness and charm.

iliss Dodd has a mezzo voice nt’
l‘ery rare quality which she uses well
in the quiet passages especially. ilr.
Peck was handicapped hy a song not
really adapted to a bass voice, but
he was the only one oi the entire
number oi contestants who gave a
iiuished artistic interpretation.

The six members ot' the college de-
hating teams were given the debating

iluch important and routine busi-

but there has been nothing done which
will cause greater pleasure especially
among the yoiingev graduates oi the
college. than the election oi Charles

“Criiinell spirit" is. indeed he has

There is a iecling oi conﬁdence that
