"A Midsummer Night's Dream" is
the play linally decided upon ior pre
sentation this year by the Caloeagath-
lair and Institute societies. Everyone
about the College llzts been pleased
with this selection, but the expected
remarks have already been called t'orth
from a row.

The general public every-

has been made to suitor so
much from amateur presentations oi‘
heavy Shakespearean plays that it is
hardly to be blamed tor having on
hand a choice collection or critical
phrases ready to thrust at anyone alli-
to attempt onc or
these greatest ol plal's. An intimate,
working knowledge of this particular-
Shakespearean drama, however, robs

all such popular criticism of its Limes

We here all attended high school
presentations oi “Macbeth" and "Home

enough to accommodate them all could
not be iound. They ﬁnally solcoted all
