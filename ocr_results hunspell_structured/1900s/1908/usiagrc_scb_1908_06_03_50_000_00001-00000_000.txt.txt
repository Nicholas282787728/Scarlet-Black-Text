Point Winners.

The nineteenth annual state meet
held last Friday on the Drake stad-
ium was an ea - Grinncll victory.
From the very ﬁr tcients when Hurt
and Turner won eight points in the
century dash and Ziegler came in
unexpectedly tor a second in the hanr
nicr tliroi the wcarers oi the Scarlet
and Blact were always in the lead.
Coach Fisher had his men trained to
the proper point Practically every
man lived up to what was expected
oi him and even the ion'dest hopes oi
the Grinncl supporters were surpass—
cd when G innell won tlic meet with
a total oim points. the highest score
that has iiccii made in s x years The
day was ideal ior the meet. The
warm rays oi the sun during the
morningmut the rain-soaked track in
good condition. The large grand stand
was completely ﬁlled on the west hy
the eiitlinsiastic delegations irom
Grime‘ll, Allies and Draltc, and the
rival college yells and songs sounded
iorth at all tiincs. The rooting and
general enthusiasm oi the iowa Col.
lege delegation was especially not
worthy and tlic ﬁve hundred, students
and alumni who occupied the section
$11 the ﬁnish line l‘UlﬂHv
the victory of eV'El)‘ “BEH‘EI‘
Scarlet and Btac

The meet Friday inarlted the last
appearance oi Htiii as ts contender ior
honors ior Grinnell in the state con»
test. His record as a member oi the
Iowa College team during the past,
iour years is an eniiablc one and
since the dais oi Rush no wearer ii
the maltose cross has won more honor
ior his school or been more ieared by
the athletes or other institutions Not
counting points made in relays, “Doc“
has won 39 points ior Grlnnell at
state meets in the past ioiir year it
is a matter or considerable n dc to
lowa College students that Captain
Huff is today considcred one oi the
iastcst sprinters in America.

The indi tdual honors went to Tur-
ner. who won a total oi 121,! points.
Turner has improved l-illlitll] 'n the
last \em', anti next year will he

made vacant hv l-luii

The 1001mm dash came out as
many Grinnell iollowers enacted and
the tremendous burst or speed claimed
ior iiiller oi lona did not materialize.
Luherger oi Ames captured tli d.

The mile run was one oi the pre ,
ties: raccs oi the da . and although
apparently tleieatctl,.13crkstresser ot

oi Allies captured second and third.
Slaght won the high jump with case
While Clark proved the canal oi Iﬂelr
sen in the pole vault and tlivided seer
and honors with the little Arne: men.

Although the weight events had
been practically conceded to Ame:
and Dralt Ziegler. the lone weight
than ior Grinnell. came in ior enough
points to upset the dope and surprise
his own tollowers. Zig. captured sec—
ond in the hammer throw and shot
put and a third in the discus. These
seven points helped to swell Gri -
Dell’s large majority.

Bair sprano another surprise in
the high hurdles by talting second.
although the Ames rooters expected
ﬁve points in this event, Walker. the
last hurdlcr tor the Aggies. had the
mistortune to trip on one oi the high
sticks and did not ﬁnish his race.

The Howard dash was won hv
Grinncll. but not bv the man who had
been counted on to taltc this event,
Flanagan was oii iorm Friday but
this did not keel) Turner irom Sprint:

thy race oi the day. Beard oi Ame:

The 20-yard run cinchcd Grillllell‘
victori, as Hurt and Turner asain
dashed across the ﬁnish ior e slit

this event and could easily have bros
hen it ii he had not loaicd at the
ﬁnish.

The relays both went to Grinncll,
biit only attcr a most spectacular per.
iormancc by Huff in the mile race.
The third Grinnell runner ﬁnished
his course second with the Draltc man
twenty yards in the lead. Hurt took
up the pace and the great tiucstion in
the minds oi the iour thousand spec-
tators wa- ould he overcome the dis~
