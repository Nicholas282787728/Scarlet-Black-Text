Pictures for Herrick Chapel.

Carbon Prints at Micheal Angclo's Pm-
phers and sibyls Given by Grinneli
Ladies inr New Building,

The kindness of friends of the col-
lege has placed upon tiie walls of
Herrick Chapel exceptionally line
carbon photographs of the entire series
of Michael Angela's Prophets and
Sibyls.

Among the great paintings oi the
world few can be regarded as having
more proiound signiﬁcance. The true
spi t of prophecy lived in the soul
of the man who painted them and
found ﬁt expression in these master
pieces.

They iorm a part or a great design
which covers the entire ceiling or the
Sistine chapel. The theme oi that
design is the preparation of the world
iorthe coming of Christ. The main
portion oi the ceiling is ﬁlled with
scenes representing signiﬁcant inci-
dents of the Old Testament story,
The iiie of the world beginning with
the creation is conceived as a great
world epic, ﬁnding its meaning and
inlﬁllment in the redemption through
Christ. Aslf they were witnesses to
the unfolding of this mighty plan, the
prophets and sibyls are seated in the
spaces between the windows where
the ceiling curves into the side walls.
The'piacing of the sibyls side by side
with the prophets as witnesses to the
coming of the Christ, carries out the
noblethoughtoi the old Latin hymn
“Tests David Cum 5ibylla.n The
nations in their inspired moments
dimly apprehend the central event
“toward, which the whole creation
moves.”

The ﬁgures or this series are among
the most noble which Michael An»
gelo’s art has produced. They are
larger than any other ﬁgures in the
entire worir, and all the vigor and
force oi the artist’s imagination has
gene into their creation.

Every phase of prophetic inspiration
is represented; calm and serene medi-

tation in the Erythraean Sibyl, rapt

ecstasy in the Delpliic, passionate
energy under the dominance oi a con—
suming thought in Etelriel, profound
brooding meditation in Jeremiah.
Each ﬁgure is accompanied by atten-
dant spirits, usually two in number,
whose attitude and expression often
help to reveal the signiucance of the
main ﬁgure. The prophets appeal to
us mainly in their imaginative aspect
as embodiments or deep phases of
human experience in its search for
truth, rather than as historiccharact-
ters. Michael Angelo knew the Bible
and had entered deeply into its spirit,
but church tradition probably deter-
mined to some extent. his conceptions
of the prophets.

presentations it is not. easy to pane.

The Delphic Sibyl is a youthlul
form oi rare beauty. She holds a
scroll, not looking at it, but at some
vision in the distance. Her wide-
opeued eyes have an expression of
rapt wonderas ii she were possessed
byaprophetic power not understood
though deeply felt as in the traditional
conception of the Delphic priestess.

In the Isaiah is revealed a strong
and intense personality. His tools is
closed though his ﬁnger keeps the
place where he has been reading. He
lhas evidently inst been roused from
meditation by an eager and earnest
spirit beckoning toward something in
the distance. orthe seven prophets

how-

world around them. Ereiriel,

the Christ as the man of sorrows The

ture. A certain nervous tension is
apparent in the entire ﬁgure, even in
the position of the feet. No other
artist has surpassed Michael Angelo
in his power to make every muscle of
the body expressive of the dominant

feeling or the soul.
The Cumaean sibyl is perhaps the

most remarkable in its boldness and

originality of all the series. Her iorm‘

is so massive and muscular that she
seems to belong to a generation oi be-

She is full oi years, yet old age has

she might live on eternally without

with the Persian Sibyi in whom the

her book at arm's length and the
bend of her shoulders has in it no
