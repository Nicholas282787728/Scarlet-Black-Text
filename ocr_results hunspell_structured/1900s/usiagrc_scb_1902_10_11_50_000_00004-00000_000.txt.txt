ADVERTISING THE COLLEGE,

Systematic Work Being Done In Bring-
ing the Advantages of Iowa College
to the Attention or Parents
and Students

In the modem world the insti-
tlltion not advertised
in some way has little change for
development and growth. In the
past Iowa College has always
found the students her best ad-
vertiseis. They ai-etlie strongest
power in bringing others to Giiii-
nell and should always be. But
even then the attendance has not
grown as it should grow. Grin-
ncll has advantages that prospec-
tive students should become ac-
quainted with We have some
courses as good or better tiian
any other college in the state and
there are no poor courses, The
requirements to. graduation arc
higher-atIowaCoIiegethanin niost
ot the colleges ot the state. We
have a larger tacuity compared
with student attendance titan any
other important school iii the
state. our college faculty are all
thoroughly trained men and
women.

Besides this Grinnell is an ideal
college town. There is no saloon
or regulargarnbiingIiouseintown.
The atmosphere and inﬂuences
surrounding students here are as
nearly pertect as can be gained,
Equipmeiit,situation. botharelav-
orable, and these advantages peer

ot making the name at thecoliege

before'and still greater efforts are
being made along those lines this
year. little later the Scanner
AND BLACK will publish an article
nicutiontng some ot the various
means ot advertising Iowa Col-
lege.

There is one way in which all
friends oi the college. and especi-
ally the students can do an im-
