THE AFFIRMATIVE WINS.

The Freshmen lnior.3oeieiy chaxe is
Decided in Favor of the Chrcsmma-
thian Represcnieirues-Decision
Two to One.

In a debate, every moment or which
was interesting. the Freshmen mem-
bgfrs of Lhe Cilrestolnathian Societyse—
cured the decision or the judges over
their brethren who represented Grin-
nell Institute, The contest was close
as the decision indicates, and both
teams made a creditable showing.
This was the ﬁrst of the Freshmen
contests and bids fair to be followed by
others just as successful asthe years
go by. The mendisplayed remarkable
coolness on the platform and handled
this mostimportantquestion in a man-
ner which Would have done justice to
older men. It is hard to say which
team excelled in delivery as both With-
out exception delivered their argu—
mentsinatelliug and forcible man-
Her.

The question was: “Resolved, That
in the cities of the United States hav-
ing a population of more than 500,000,
the political conditions are such as to
render municipal ownership and ope-
ration of street railways undesirable.”
The allirmative was maintained by D.
E. Campbell, II. B. Quarton and II. G.
Kinsley of tile Chlestomalillan society
while W. R. Metz, F. M. Thompson,
and E, H. Mullson supported the neg-
ativc for Gl'illneil Institute. There
was a good deal or discussion over the
interpretation of the question as to
whether municipal ownership should
be tried now or in the future. The
airirniativc insisted on the present
and were able to bring the maiority of
the audience into their way of think-
ing.

It was 8:25 by the chapel clock when
Professor II. W. Norris, chairman of
the evening, called the audience to or-
der and announced the ﬁrst speaker
for the afﬁrmative, II. B. Quarton. In
a well arranged speech, the speaker
brieily reviewed the history of the
question, stating conditions in Eng-
land and the United States and citing
examples or municipal ownership. he
said at the present time, abolition of
graft could not be accomplished and
that therefore present conditions do
not warrant municipal ownership. He
quoted several examples of cities that
had failed on account of the corrup-
Lion of ofﬁcials.

The debate for the negative was
opened by W. R :Metz, who in a stir»
ring Speech stated the position of his
side. Iledefendcd the present political
conditions and said that conditions
are not so bad as stated. It is possible
to get good men for public ofﬁce at the
present time. Reform has become
popular and conditions are improving
constantly.

D. E. Campbell continued the do.
hate for afﬁrmative and took in the
discussion of present election methods.

His speech was devoted almost entire-
9v

 

ly to the explanation or the means of
obtaining public oilicei-s. There are
two methods, by election and by ap-
pointment, both or which are domi-
nated by the boss. F. M. Thompson
or the negative showed that even un-
der present conditions, some depart-
ments were run successfully by the
municipality, e. gﬁthe waterworks.
Under the system of the negative,
civil service laws would be enforced
and capable men could be secured.
The private companies are the chief
cause for corruption as they verily put
a premium on corruption and graft.

II. G. Kinsley closed the debt fortlle
alllrmative and reiterated the state
ments of his colleagues to the effect
that present political conditions do
not warrant municipal ownership.
Furthermore, any attempt of the city
to obtain control would be defeated
by the political grafters. E. II. Mun-
son was the last speaker for the nega-
tive and said that the recent expos-
ures show an increased civic pride.
Recent elections demonstrate that
the people are awakening and
are taking a greater interest in public
affairs. He also emphasized the point
of obtaining responsible city oilicei-s
by means of the civil service laws. The
rebutals were merely a summary of
the leading,r points; the afﬁrmative
making use of charts.

The judges, Professor Wilcox, of
Iowa City; Rev, E. M. \‘ittum allrl
Supcrintendeut Eugene rrenely of
Griunell, voted two for airirinative
and one for negative. This debate
gives each society one victory this
year and the iicxtcontcst between the
Sophomores will he the deciding one.
This debate will occur in March and
will be on the question of conventional
tariff between the United States and
Germany.

Lasr Evening.

Last evening at, Mears Cottage ti e
ladies of the facility were hostesses at
a banquet given in honor of President
and Mrs. Main. The guests asseme
bled at eight-thirty and shortly after
nine they proceeded to the dining
room, which, during the remainder of
the evening, was the scene of unusual
festivities. The members of the fac-
ulty, iorry-iour in all, were seated at
tables which were artistically decorav
ed with roses and ferns, and illumie
nated by several stately candelabra
and which were so arranged that they
formed the letter M., with the guests
of honor Seated at the lower end of
the central portion of the letter. Dr.
Steiner as toast master was seated at
Mrs. Mainls right, and at the conclu-
sion of the three course dinner, after
a few introductory remarks, read tele~
grams of congratulations from the two
former presidents, George A. Gates,
and Dan E. Bradley, and introduced
as the ﬁrst speaker, Prof. Jesse Macy,
who responded to the toast of “Our
Inheritance.” Mr. Macy mentioned
the fact that from its Very lirfgln lowa
College hall stood for breadth and lib»
erality along all branches of knowie

ﬁrst to welcome *new Contributions in
the world of science and philosophy,
and iihile such new doctrines were not
necessarily approved, yet the attitude
of the college had always been to al-
low its SLudents access to all new (loc-
trines and theories. This Spirit of lib-
erality and brearlth of View had char-
acterized the college throughout its
history. The toastmaster then read
telegrams Di congratulation from for-
mer professors and instructors—from
Professors Nollen, Whitcomb, .iJ'il'l-
son, Bodine and Miss Denise, and mes-
sages alleged to be from Emperor Wil—
liam and King Alfonso furnished
amusement to the guests. The latter
sent congratulations upon the raising
of the Main(e) and this sentiment
served as the introduction to the sec-
ond speaker, Mr. Ilendrixsoll, whose
subject (was “The Raising oi- Evolu-
tion of (the) Main,” Mr. llendi‘ixson,
whose connection with the college has

who had beena part of the college
for only a short time.

The remaining two waste of the
evening were given by Mr. Horn of
the Academy and ML Smith of the
School or Music, and after a short per.
iod of enthusiastic cheering, the
guests listened to a response from the
President. President Main was evi-
dently deeply alIected by the events
of the evening and introduced his re-
marks by saying that he was dazed;
that he really could not realize What
had been going on during the past
week; that the ﬂood of messages from
alumni and friends of the institution,

the enthusiasm of the facility had
moved him so deeply that he was un-

In addressing the faculty he spoke
somewhat as follows:
