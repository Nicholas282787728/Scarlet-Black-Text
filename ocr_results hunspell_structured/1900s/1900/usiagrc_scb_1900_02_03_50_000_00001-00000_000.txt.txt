In the absence or Pres. Engellte
last Wednesday evening, the reg-
ular meeting of the Grinnell In-
stitute was called to order by the
vice-president. The program was
ratircr longer than usual, but a
careful preparation and good
work upon the ﬂoor served to
make it an interesting one. The
extelnpol'aneotls work deserves
special mention, and particularly
that ofthe negative speaker onthe
debatewhohad butatew moments
for preparation and thought. One
sharp criticism, however, can be
applied to the society as a whole.
Every member, and especially
every participant in the program,
should be on time. Some have
classes and are excusable; others

.ing‘s

 

have not, and are not in the least
excusable. It looks bad, doubly
so in the presence of visitors. to
have the ﬁrst quarter of an even-
prograrn interrupted by
stragglcrs.

“Current news” was the ﬁrst
number called for, and was given
by E]. Lyman. Conditionsinthe
Transvaal, Kentucky politics, at-
fairs in Manila, and the increase
in our navy, were the themes or
his talk.

R. Macintosh then delivered all
address on “Robert Ingel‘soll and
his Inﬂuence on Christianity.”
The speaker brought out one
thought which was entirely new
to some of his hearers. lngersoll.
as we all know, was a ‘podless
man and spent his entire life in
Slandet'lng and attackrng the Bir
ble, yet this very practice, instead
of making more inﬁdels, probably
created more and better students
of the Bible. He awakened an
inter-est in Christianity and thus
accomplished what he sought to
destroy.

The music of the evening was
furnished by a quartet ot horns,
manipulated by Delavan, Way,
Hailiesand Robinson. Thcrnusic
was good and so was the encore,
which a prolonged applause der
manded, Good music always sets
off the literary work to advantage,

The externporaneous work was
given by Davis, Hulsizer and
Camel, who extemporaneously
spoke on the debate. Davis
spoke on “Physical culture in
Iowa College," expressing tropes
that the general tone of the stu-
dents would be raised and that
the track team o[ the iuture would
be brought up to the standard of
the past. Hulsizer brieﬂy reviewed
the “Recent Disgrace of Kenr
tucky" and showed that he was
posted in up-to-datc politics,

The question of the debate was:
“Resolved, that the Englishclaims
in the controversy with the South
African republic are justiﬁable,"
Dickinson supported the amrma
tive with a brief, yet exhaustive
and careiuliy prepared argument.
The history of the negotiations
and grants made between the
Boers and the English was rccitr
ctl;and the present condition of
affairs. suffrage. proportion of
population. taxes, etc.. falling to

 

the lot of the Ontlandci-s, were
tully discussed.

The main points in the defense
of the negative \VCI'C that indepeir
dcnce had been given by the
English, whrch they were now enr
deavoririg to revoke; that in the
pursuit of gold, the Orrtlanders
were endeavor-ing to gain entire
controls-EBoerGovernmeiitavhieh
tvould mean death to Boer instir
tutions; and that this case is an
application ot the theory of For
litieal Economyi‘the best gov-
ernment is that in which the peo-
ple are willing to be governed."
The decisron of the judges stood
two to one in favor ofthe afﬁtmar
trve. ,

The program was closed by an
interesting and well prepared
discussion between Parish and
Robinson.
