Ernest Seton-Thompson.

A crowded house greeted Mr.
Thompson at the Congregational
church last evening. to listen to
his lecture on “The Personality of
Wild Animals." After a brief ins
troduction of his subject, Mr.
Thompson proceeded to illustrate
the lecture by means of the ster-
eopticon from pictures, the most
or which are ol his own taking.

He seemed to be personally ac.
quainted with the incidents sur-
rounding every scene and proved
himself an admirable entertainer,
Mr. Thompson speaks ironr prac—
tical experience. It has been his
privilege to come in personal con»
tact with every animal upon which
he lectures. and tor many years
he made his living by trapping
wild animals, He is n lteen ob»
server of animal nature and under-
stands their habits of life as well
as it is possible for man to do,
Besides being a good naturalist,
Mr. Thompson is an artist of rare
ability. The quality of his photo~
graphs is excellent, and his draws
ings cannot be praised too highly.
The lecture was instructive as well
asentertaining. Theaudiencewas
given a true insight into real ani~
mal lite, and it was interesting to
learn that animals do not differ
from human beings as much as
most people suppose. For in-
stance, a little bear. whose life was
made miserable because of his too
greatloveforsweetmeats, was cons
tinually getting his mother into
trouble. Notwoanimalsareallke;
some have pleasant dispositions
and some have quite the opposite.
Good and bad healthis quite prev.
alent among them. The longer
Mr. Thompson lccturcd, the more
it dawned upon the writer that
wild animals possess agi'eat many
of the characteristics of mankind.

 

The Thanksgiving Recess.

By the President at the United
States, Proclamation: “It has
pleasedAlmightyGodto bring our
nationinsafety and honorthrough
another year. Works of religion
and charity have everywhere been
manifest. Our country through all
its extenthasbeenblestwithabunr
dant harvest. Labor and great
industries of the people have pros
pered beyond all precedent. our
commerceisspread overilieworld.
Our power and inﬂuence in the
cause oi freedom and enlighten-
ment have extended over distant
seas and lands. The lives at our
ofﬁcial representatives and many
ofour people in China have been
marvelously preserved. We have

been generally exempt from pestle
lence and other great calamities,
and even the tragic visitation
which overwhelmed the city of
Galveston made evident the senti-
ment of sympathy and christian
charity by the virtue ot which we
are one united people."

The above proclamation re-
minds Iowa Collcge students that a

Those who live near Grinnell will
doubtless arrange to spend the
time at home. For their beneﬁt.

Professor Simmons Has Gone!

The anticipated news has come
sooner than was expected.

Proi. James Simmons came to
the college in 1889 as an instructor
in mathematics. A quiet, unde-
monstrative managrccabletliongh
somewhat reserved, his place was
won ior- him chiorly by the very
high testimonials which had pres
ceded him. These were col-dial,
comprehensive and without a par.
ticle of reserve as to his scholar-
ship or character.

He dropped into his place as
simply asa child, but his methods
and words quickly impressed his
pupils and his associates with the
assurance that lie was a lllll~grown
man. One year bore him upwind
into the instructorship in mental
and moral science; he became lull
professor in that department the
next year, and in '92 petlagogics
was added to his work. There
was nothing higher in the college

 

except the presidency. Every
step of that ascent met the hearty
approval of students, Faculty and
and trustees.

His work was often interrupted
by disease, and when pcrtormed
it was under the burden ofphysic-
alweakness. Dtiringthelastyear
ire was obliged to give up his
weekly bible class, and, at com-
mencement, to seek a rest from
all work, for a year, in Colorado.
Weeks and months among the
mountain pines, bore him steadily
downward. Tuberculosis of the
throat brought the end last Mons
day evening in Denver, whither his
wifeand childrenhad accompanied
him.

His department was made at
tractive. His students loved him
and his work. Under his guidance
they acquired more than know—
ledge; they learned to think. His
lectures and his writings were
models of clearness, conciscnesss
and candor, all inspired by high,
manly and christian aspiration.
He aroused the worthiest ambis
tions, ambitions not for a noisy
leadership. but for protound and
solid excellence in character and
in learning, Among christian
disciples lie resembled John rather
than Peter, and among eminent
Americans he was more like Em-
erson than Roosevelt. 'A man of
such mental and moral grace and

virtue is a treasure to any college,
a benefactor to any class. His
absence is it distinct and conscious
loss, Hismemoryamongstudents
and in the Faculty will be en-
shrined in gratithde and affection.
