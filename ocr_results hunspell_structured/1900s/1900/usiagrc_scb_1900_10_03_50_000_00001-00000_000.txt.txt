Chrestomathian.

The ﬁrst gun otthe campaign
in Iowa College was ﬁred at last
Saturday’s meeting of the Chesto
society. From the digniﬁed Ree
publican to the conscientious Pror
htbitionist and howling Populist,
all were represented. This was
one of the main features of the
program and coming as it did in
the midst of the campaign was
both entertaining and instructive.
Those who impersonated the varir
ous politicians in this drama were:
Crosby the Republicans, Bair the
Democrats, Dennison the Populist
from Kansas, Crabb the Prohibie
tionist. and McKee the Socialist
Labor, The mustc ot the evening
was furnished by Miss Nelson who
gave two piano selections, one of
which was in response to an en-
core. Hunting spoke extempor-
alieously on the coal strike, after
which the society listened to a
very interesting and instructive
talk by one oi its ex. members.
Qtiaiie '00, Professor Hendrlxrl

 

son. who was present. responded
to the invitation to speak and
gave the society some good ad~
vice.

The remainder ot the evening
was taken up with the debate, the
question being that much discus-
sed problem whether the party
man or the independent voter
bring the best results. Jones and
Mc-Keag upheld the affirmative
while Meade and McCarty defend
ed the negative.

Senior Girls’ Club.

Thegirlsotthe seniorclub were
very pleasantly entertained at the
home of Mrs. Moody last Saturr
day evening, Nearly all oi the
members were present and shows
ed a spirit ot’ zeal and industry,
perhaps a little unusual, as one
after another prodtrced some bit
ot embroidery or mending. While
the work progressed plans were
discussed (or future meetings and
business transacted, The next
item of interest to the members
was the “spread" which was ap-
preciated and devoured in real
school girl tashion.

Mlss Marie Sedtvick elitertainr
ed the company with a recitation
which merited hearty applause.
Music was another pleasant fea-
ture of the evening.

The success of this ﬁrst meeting
would seem to insure a pleasant
and proﬁtable year tor the Senior
Girls Club of igor which has as
itsaim the iurtherance ot pleasure
and culture.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 3, l900.

Mr. Beach and Mr. Tool. The
debate was: Resolved, that the
present policy oi expansion is
lust. Thedrﬁrmativewassupporte
ed by Gonzalesand Gray, the neg.
ative by Dunn and Paul, The de
bate was spirited and showed con.
srderable preparation, the afﬁrniae

The Glee Club.

Of the applicants tor Glee Club
honors, seventeen passed the ewe
amination, and from this number
the ten vacancies “ill be ﬁlled.
This means that one-half the club
will consist of new men. 'out in

spite of this fact it is believed that
the club will be up to its usual
standard.

Professor Cole has already
shown his ability to develop a
strong club out of comparatively
weak material, so that with the
unusual amount otgood material
on hand, there can be no doubt as
to the success of this year’s club.

Y. M. C. A. Notes,

There is a notable increase
this year in the vigor of the
Christian Associations of the
college. It is a healthy sign
to see so many men and was
men making the meetings. the
Bible study classes and the mis-
sion study class a part ot their
college life. Heretofore it has
been the custom in Iowa College
to have the Bible study classes
conducted by protessors. From
the fact that student leadership
has had such plienominal success
in most similar institutions in the
United States, it was thought wise
to try the plan here, Already the
wisdom ot the change is being
proved. by tile increase in attend~
ance and by the devotional spirit
shown. It is desired that any
who expect to enter either the
Bible study classes or the mission
study class should hand their
names tothe committes at once.

Y. W. C. A Notes.

The work ot the Young Wom-
en‘s Christian Association has be-
gun in a very encouraging way

this tall. Two cabinet meetings
have been held, one of these with
Miss Ruth Paxson, the State Sec—
t'ctary. Plans are being made tor
student Bible classes, to begin in
a week or two, and all members
are urged to attend, as those of
last year proved very helpiul.
Attention is called to the State
Convention, to be held in Cedar
Falls about the ﬁrst of November.
Please bear this in mind. and plan
to attend,
