Oﬁbitorial

OF LATE YEARS, it has become
the custom of almost every school
which makes a pretense of sup
porting a football team, to re
quire spring practice of the foot
ball candidates, on the theory
that work taken at this time will
be found valuable when hard
training is begun the following
autumn. In fact, Princeton, be-
cause of the wretched physical
condition oi her foot ball players
last fall, established a system oi
indoor gymnastic training tor the
candidates for next fall’s team,
which continued all winter. The
number of schools which have
adopted this preliminary practice
is steadily on the increase and the
idea has been received wilh favor
everywhere, The same system
might well be adopted here in
Grinnell. As yet no deﬁnite call
has been issued tor spring foot
ball practice, but this iaet should
not hinder every old foot ball
player, and every man whoever
intends to play foot ball, from
getting out and taking systematic
and faithful work with either the
base ball or track team, in order
that he may gain added strength
to endure the hard knocks which
will be his portion next fall. We
have had too many evidences in
past years of the weakness of
teams which were unﬁt physically
to endure a hard game, no matter
with what spirit and desperation
they played. and in direct contrast
we have the physical condition ot
our last season's team which was
the envy of every team in lowa.
We have good reason to see to it
that the same shall be true of
Grinnell's teams in the future.

would urge
that every foot. ball candidate be
