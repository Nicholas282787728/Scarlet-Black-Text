Redpath Concert.

The largest audience ofthe year
greeted the finest concert of the
year last evening in the Congrega
tional church. The liberal and, at
times, extravagant applause was
evidence enough that the performs
ers succeeded in touching a re
sponsive chord in their hearers.
whowereentirely mercilessintheir
demands for encores. Yet the re-
sponses were graciously made, and
in each case added to the favorable
impression made by the program
numbers.

Mrs. Meredith possesses ahigh
soprano voice of great power.
clearness and ﬂexibility. which was
shown to good advantage in her
solo numbel, as well as in the
opening duet with Miss Clary.
Every tone was rich and pure and
true in intonation. and her musir
cianly qualities entirely satisfying.
When all is so ﬁne. it may appear
ungracious to call especial atten-
tion to any one singer. but the rar~
ity of such a contralto voice as
Miss Clary possesses, its great
range and its absolute evenness
throughout life entire register, war»
rant such mention of it. The
wealth and power of her tone neve
er becomes forced or tinmusical.
and the beauty and softness of the
contralto quality is cariied to her

 

highest tones. Her singing oi
G0unod‘s”chentir”was faultless.
though probably not as widcly en-
joyed as her encore

In Van dcr Sltlcken’s "Come
with Me.” Mr. Tonne showed a
high, ringing. clear tenol'voicc. In
“All Through the Night." he disr
played the sweetness and sottness
of his voice. Dr. Carl Dufft seem
ed a favorite with the audience.
his rich. vibrant bass voice delight»
ing everyone. His singing of
Gounod’s “She Alone Charmeth
My Sadness.” brought forth a
double encore. ‘

Miss von Fursch found favor as
much by the Slmplictty of her
manner as by the sweetness other
violin tones. Miss Kobel‘ had by

no means an easy task set iorher. ,

In addition to a solo number. she
was called upon to accompany
nearly twenty numbers. in which
task she proved herself to be a ca-
pable pianist and excellentaccom~
pailist. The long program was
brought to a brilliant ﬁnish by a
truly ﬁnished rendition of the im-
posing quartet from ”Rigoletto,"
in which the beautitul blending of
voices and consistent and artistic
building of climaxes was especial
ly apparent.
Basketball Game.

The ﬁrst basket ball played by
the college team resulted in a de-
feat at the hands of the Y M C.
A. team of Des Moines. Two 20-
minute halves uere played and in
the ﬁrst half the Y. M. C. A, had
clearly the best of it, winning the
half by a score of 14 to 6 Capt.
Lynde’s team showed the best
team work. The baskets being
higher than our own, seriously
handicapped our team.

The play was fast from the
start. and often it was difﬁcult to
follow the ball. the passing was
done so quickly.

Douglass scored the ﬁrst point
for Grinncll on a foul by Ford.
and was quickly followed by a
pretty basket from ﬁeld by Lynde.
The play was singularly tree from
all roiighness.a1tliough fast and
furious throughout.

After a rest of ten minutes, the
teams lined up for the second half

and the ball had not been in play
over a minute before Douglass.
coming out of a ﬁerce scrimmage,
landed it in the basket.

 

The men were now playing dese
pcr-ately for possession of the
sphere. and after the Y. M. C. A.
team had made 2 points, Giinnell
landed three baskets iil succession.
it was anybody’s game with ﬁve
minutes yet to play and the best
the Y. M. C. A. team could do
was to make one point otf a dou-
ble loul. The Register says it was
the hottest ﬁnish ever seen in a
basket ball game in Des Molnes.
and the result was in doubt until
time was called.

Following is the lineup and
summary of the game:

Caloca-lnstitute Flayt
During the last two weeks‘earn-
est and faithful work has been
done by the actors in Pinero's
“Lady Bountilul," under the efﬁ-
cient direction of Miss Archibald.

.the result of whose work is already

evident in the progress which has
been made. Owing toacorifiict
of dates. the date of the play.
which had been ﬁxed for March
goth, has been changed to March
24th. This fact will
greater haste in preparation than
had at ﬁrst been contemplated,
but it is hoped that the perform-
ance of the play will be in every
way as ﬁnished and successful as
it would be it given with a week's
more time for rehearsal.

The history of Calocaelnstitute
plays covers a Wide territory.rang-
ing from Sophocles “Electra.” to
"The Lady of Lyons.”_ They have
invariably been of a high order of
merit. “Lady Bountiful" is a more
distinctly modern play than has
ever before been attempted. but
ought to lose nothing by com-
parison with the others. The
actors have had the best training
which has ever been accorded any
of these plays. All indications
point to a production which will
be well w0ith attending and
which will fully equal the high
standard set by the plays of these
societies in other years.
