Till: DEATH of Mls. L. F. Par-
ker comes as a blow to the college
and community. Professor and
Mrs, Parker have been actively
identiﬁed with tlle college almost
since its foundation, and have ex-
erted‘a large inﬂuence in shaping
its character. Everyone who knew
Mrs. Parker irresistibly formed a
warm attachment for her, and we
feel that the college has lost a true
and loyal friend.

IT HAS seemed as though in the
past, the literary societies have
had to bear the brunt of hostile
criticism, and whatever success
they have attained has received
but meagre appreciation. This
state of affairs has not existed
wholly without cause. The faith-
ful ter‘v who attended the meet»
ings seemed to delight in conjec-
tures as to when the millenial days
of prosperous society work would
come, and to ﬁnd fault with the
lack of proper support. It never
pays to be critical instead of cre-
ative. The trouble with Iowa
College society work has been
that for over forty years it has
been too closely shut up within
its shellr Enerusted with the tras
ditions of the past, it has crawled
along seemingly unmindful or the
possibilities of a broaderllite. It
was only tour years ago that we
talleringly and tentatively entered
into an intercollegiate debate and
this last year we had two and
next year it is proposed to broad-
en our interests still more by en-
tering a larger league. More ex-
tensive opportunities means in-
creased responslbilities, The time
is past when we can delude our-
selves with the idea that intercol-
legiate ‘debates can be won on
three or four weeks‘ work. The
lesson has been a costly one but
it has been worth learning. Those
who have been watching the work
of the literary societies duringthe
past year have noticed avery pro-
nounced increase in the interest
manifested. Visitors also have
been more numerous. Instead of
the regular yearly pilgrimage ot
one member of the faculty, this
year a large number trom the fac-
ulty and‘town have given cncoun
agement by their presence. The
work of the societies along all
lines has been spirited and strong.
A marked feature of this improvc~
ment is the complete and thorn
ough system of preliminary de-
bates inaugurated by both socier
ties and the fact that the lower

classnlen are taking a voly promo

More orations have appeared on
the program than forseveral years
past. The state contest last year
gave us a viclv of college oratory,
arid the fact that the Interstate
contest will be held in Des Moines
next year should be an incentive
for Grinnell to attempt to win
ﬁrst at State. Several have al-
ready begun Work and others will
no doubt enter later, With these
two lines of society work in sucll
aﬂourishing condition, it is evident
that society work is beginning to
take its rigltttul place among the
activities ot the college, But
much as we commend this pro
gress we must still realize that
greater efﬁciency can be attained
and it should be the aim of each
ot the societies to push on from
year to year towards a still higher
standard of excellence,

Hofmann's Melusina.

‘The choral work to be presented
next Monday evening by a chorus
of sixty voices and soloists, is one
of sustained interest throughout.
The action never lags and the
music is always interesting and
beautiful, The story is a dramat-
ization of a popular German
legend of the watersnynlph, Mel-
usrna. who is wooed and won by
the hunter, Count Raymond. but
only on the condition that lie ask
no questions as to where she goes
or what she does on every seventh
day, when she disappears troni
mortal View. The main action of
the story is developed from this
mysterious disappearance and the
efforts of the people to connect it
with drought and famine that have
fallen upon the land.

Miss BuckleyI who sings the
part of Melusina, has a glorious
high soprano voice, tull of dram»
atic intensity.

Recital.

The fourth of the series of
graduating recitals was given in
the college chapel last evening by
Miss Christine E. Kendrick and
Miss Fannie R, Buchanan, assist-
ed by Miss Vesta Atkinson, so-
prano, and Miss Olive M. Myers,
accompanist The audience was
large and showed hearty apprecis
ation of every number on the
program. ,
