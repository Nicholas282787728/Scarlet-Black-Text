THE RESKGNATION of Pres. Gates.
although not entirely unexpected.
nevertheless comes as somewhat
of a shock to the students. While
the fact that Mrs, Gates could not
endure the Grinnell climate had
madetit certain that Pres. Gates
could not remain much longel,
still the hope had been entertained
that he might not sever his con
nection with the college until a
somewhat later date. Since 1387
Pres. Gates has been at the head
of the college, and has guided it
wisely through its period of grctit
est growth and developiiieiii
How much the college owes to IIM
devotion to its welfare and careful
management of its interests can»
not be calculated. but can only be
gratefully acknowledged.

We wish to express our entire
sympathy with the statement ol
the trustees which appears in an-
other column. It only 'remains
for us to state, in behalf of the
students, the regard and esteem
in which Pres. Gates has always
been and is now held by the stu»
dent body, His attitude toward
all legitimate student activities
has ever been of the friendliest
nature and his condemnation of
those which were not legitimate
has been unﬂinching. Not only
has he stood for what was best in
college lite, but his teaching has
been a most helpful and inspiring
preparation for the life which is
to tollow atter college.

We teel that towa College has
been indeed fortunate in having
the beneﬁt of such faithful service
during so long a period oi years
and wish to express our sincere
regret that this service cannot be
longer continued. The absence oi
both Pres. and Mrs. Gates will be
a distinct loss to our college lite
which will be hard to remedy.
SCARLET AND BLACK has only the
best wtshes to offer [or their luture
welfare.

Chresto-Ellis Joint Meeting.

Last Saturday evening the joint
meeting of the Chresto and Ellis
societies was held. The meeting
was opened by a vocal solo by
Mrs. Heidel, which was lugllly
appreciated by the audience.

The second number was a chat-
aster sketch by Miss Field. She
took for her subject, “Tecumseh,
Shawnee Chief.“ This was very
interesting. She traced the lllSr
lory at this warrior troni his youth
to his early death,

This number was followed by a
select reading by George Grier.
iroin Eugene Field's works.

Perhaps the most interesting
part at the program was the Gei‘s
nitiii dialogue by Miss Natli and
Arthur Kisser. The next number
was music by the way ttiniily.

entitled "’Tivas All a Dream.”

The program ended with music

was one of the best that the snciEr
ties have listened to this year, and
the social afterwards was enjoyed
by all.
