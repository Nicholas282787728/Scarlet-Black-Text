The Past Thirteen Years.
(Conltnuctl from ﬁrst page)
touch with student life. They
must be combined in one man—
scholastic attainments, business
ability, patience, justice and a no-
ble christian character.

No one could fill the above indi-
cated position and leave a ﬂawless
history. But so far as human at»
tainmentisperfectandhumanwilh
power capable, our retiring presi-
dent has performed his mission.
Thirteen years of service ended!
a service requiring strength of
body, mind and heartiof the very
life, even. . Such a service is the
highesttributeapresidentcan give
its college, and such an acknowls
edgement the highest tribute the
college can give its president.

Just a few years previous to
President Gates’ ascension to the
presidency, Iowa college had en.
tered upon an almost aggressive
policy of progression. The sys-
tem of ”self-reporting” had been
abolished by the faculty and the
era of our present day free and
easy social regime entered rrpon.
A few years later Iowa College,
with neighboring institutions, do
veloped intercollegiate athletics
until that important branch of
college life has reached its present
magnitude. Some years later the
“group system” of courses was
substituted for the older and more
mechanical "courses,” offering a
wider range of choice to the stu-
dents own preference. All of
these innovations, typical of the
new policy, received the hearty
commendation of Pres. Gates. He
entered into the spirit of the Cole
lcge. He carried the “honor sys»
tem,” as it was then called, still
further and instituted a basis of
good faith between students and
faculty, which is now a permanent
feature of Griniiell. To President
Gates is due the present order
and good conduct of the chapel
exercises. To him also is due the
quiet and order of the reading
room. One of the excellencies of
his administration is the relation»
ship he has established between
himself and the student body.
Coroperation, not force, has been
the means by which student re-
forms have been accomplished.

Aggressiveness has marked the
policy of Pres. Gates in a material
way also. The general endow»
ment has been increased to some-
thing over $350,000. Two new
buildings, entirely out of propor-
tion to the wealth of the college
as some thought, have been built.
Under his administration the fame
ulty has been increased from seve
enteen to thirty-three, offering eds
ucationaladvantages,bothin qual~
ity and in the number of students
proportioned to each instructor,
equalled by few colleges of im-
portance in the land. Year after
year the requirements have been

raised. Students of the sophos
more class of 1887 could scarcely
enter freshman at the beginning
of last semester. Until to-day
Iowa College stands without peer
among western colleges in the
grade of work done, and Harvard,
Yale. Princeton and Chicago open
wide their doors to ourgraduates.
Not all the Cledit for results ac—
complished is due to President
Gates, for he has been ably sup.
ported by a loyal faculty. But.
nevertheless, his policy has been
“only the best.” Cheap induce-
ments have never been offered to
increase the attendance of stun
dents. If anything, difﬁculties
have been placed in the way.
And still they come and Iowa
College continues.

Though a busy man, President
Gates did not conﬁne himself by
any means to his one sphere of
work. He was deeply interested
in all educational and religious
movements in the right direction.
In the face of the world he cham-
pioned right and feared nobody.

No man could have nobler aims
than has Fred. Gates during his
life in the college. No man could
be asked to do more than he has
tried to do. Another may take
up the work when he lays It down
and carry it on perhaps to even
greater successes, But Iowa Col-
lege will not forget the stirring.
active. aggressive policy which
has placed her in her present po-
sition of prestige and power.

His Attitude Toward Athletics.

The relation of President Gates
to Grinnell’s athletics is a subject
calculated to inspire any friend of
the college who has followed our
record on the diamond, gridiron
and track during the past decade.
His name is inseparably con-
nected with the glory which has
meant so much to Grinnell as a
school and still more to the benc»
ﬁciaries of a rational athletic sys-
tem. Until three years ago Grins
nell occupied a very unique posis
tion in Iowa athletics, being the
”only college outside the state ins
stitutions that had achieved any
consistent, enduringsuccess along
athletic lines. Others had far
more material and equal opportu-
nities, but they failed to attain
rank equal to Grinnell‘s. Years
passed and Iowa college, still lac
boring under many disabilities,
continued to gather in the lion’s
share ofthe athletic trophies while
otherinstitutionsgazcd on wonder
ingly and muttered in the conster—
nation oi defeat, strange things
about the ”Grinnell spirit,"

ThatFresidentGates has always
had very decided ideas in the mat-
ter of student discipline none will
deny, but soon after the beginning
of his administration it became ap»
parent that he entertained views
on the matter greatly at variance

 

 

with those of preceding regimes.
He began to inspire trust and cons
ﬁdelice in students by rcposing
conﬁdence in them. Old lines
were broken down and a more ras
tional system of limitation set irp.
Not the least feature of the change
was the generous policy assumed
toward athletics. The change in
discipline came as if from a magic
wand. The creators of strife re~
tired to the athletic ﬁeld, there to
vent the animal spirits that had
been the terror of former days.
Thus was created a higher code of
honor among students, while the
development of the physical man
received the emphasis it had so
long lacked.

While our ietiriiig executive has
never stooped to arty Clicapi
methods for the sake oi inspiring
our athletic teams, there is little
doubt that he has unconsciously
been a greater factnr irt their sllc~
cess than he himself realizes. The
“Griniicll spirit” comes firm) the
Giinnell atmosphere. and or the
latter, George A Gates lliti been
no small part during the past lhii'»
teen years. Giiiinell's athletes
have Simply exhibited in their cons
tests the same dogged rcSistunce
which theirpresident has shown in
support of his convictions. Such
a personality cannot exert a new
tral influence on those who come
in contact with it. It has had its
influence on Grinncll’s athletics,
and none will deny that it has been
an influence that made for better
and higher things in the realm of
sport. There are those who cons
tend that athletics has been given
too free a rein at GrllInCll. ln the
case of a few, a very few individ-
tials, this has doubtless been true,
but as President Gates has becn
heard to say, “where it has done

one bad it has done ten good."
Tire athletic regime at Grinnell
has resulted in the development of
strong, manly men, just such men
as the world needs to face the
problems of today. Only let
Grinnell'sathletesfollowthecthi .
al code for whose support Presi-
dent Gates has so often appealed,
and little tear need be entertained
of future haim from athletics.

Mrs. Gates’ Place in the College.
tCoutrnucd irnm first unset

interest in the study of Art Hisr
tory, either of photographs, books
or lecture course. The beginning
of what it is hoped may become a
valuablecollection ofphotographs
has been made, as well as some
desirable additions to the books
of the Alt Alcove.

But the distinctive gift to Iowa
College, which Mrs, Gates has
made, that for which Faculty and
students would give largest tribute
of praise and appreciation, has
been the influence of the sweet
and lovely womanhood. which
permeated her every thought and
deed, Radiant of face to a degree
that one has said, “a look from
her made life seem worth the
living," with social tact, born of
an appreciation of all that is ad

miiable in others, with the rare
courtesy toward the humblest,
that has its roots in truest culture,
with evcnncss and serenity of
spirit, which comes only with a
vision of the Unseen, Mrs. Gates
has placed, upon all who have felt
the magic of her presence, a debt
ofgiaiittrde which at this formal
parting they would most gla|e~
fully acknowledge

President Gates and the Faculty.

In thinking of the relations be—
tween our President and his asso-
ciates on the Faculty, one of the
ﬁrst things that occurs to me (and
it will serve as well as another
thing for an introduction) is his
admirable way of letting us alone.
In his conception of college ad-
ministration, each department is
2i little kingdom in itself, and with
that kingdom the President has
not meddled. Success has been
all that he asked: and with the
methods- by which that success
has been secured, he did not con-
cerii himself. We have always
felt that In every plan we made
and in every nieasuie we unders
tnclt in the interests of our depart—
merits, we had llte most absolute
liberty of action; and lhat in our
relations to one another andtn the
students we could he cnnﬁdent
that there would be no intlusive
activity from the ofﬁce ofthe Press
ident.

None the less, however, were
we always sure of the President's
sympathy. It would have been
difﬁcult to tell from his course for
ward the different departments,
whether PiesidentGaicswas more
interested in Science or Literature,
in Language or Philosophy, in
History or Economics. While his
surpassing interest in those eco-
nomic questions which bear more
diiectly on the moral well being
of man has always been evident,
it has not hindered his hearty co-
operation with the Faculiyin their
efforts for the development of
their special lines of work.

President Gates’ theory is that
for a college such as ours the ideal
government is that of the Faculty,
In details otdiscipline he has been
ready to take responsibility and
act promptly in emergencies. and
has thus saved the Faculty from
much hard and unrewarding labor
and discussion. In matters of gen-
eral concern, however, his aim has
been to secure united Faculty ac-
tion.

He has thus made an admirable
presidrng career in that difﬁcult
delib 'atlve body -—the Faculty
Meeting. Keen commonsense,
with an unmixed desire to advance
discussion and bring the real judg-
ment of the body to expression.
haseuablcd him to use parliament-
ary principles, without permitting
action to be hindered by parlias
mentary rules. His genial humor
has brightened many a dreary
discussio and his enthusiasm
has given interest often to what
without it would have bcen dry
details of administration. He has
helped us lose the sense of the
pettiness at our work in the feel-
ing of its greatness. It is the
friend and comrade iii the work
of Iowa College quite as much as
the Executive and leader whom
we of the faculty shall lose in
George A. Gates.
