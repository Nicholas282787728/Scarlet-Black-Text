vorable for a ﬁrst class program. The
room was stnall, tlte temperature high
and the meeting was not remarkable
for the attendance, either or listeners
or of participants. The work present-

- ed, however, was good.

Spattlding read a paper upon the
“Passion Play," presented at regular
intervals in Switzerland. The roman-
tic beginning at this custom and its
development were carefully traced,
ending in a brief exposition of the
modern presentation. The paper was
instinctive and showed caret rrl previr

The second oration ot the term was
delivered by Gleysteen. James G,
Blaine’s early lite and political career
