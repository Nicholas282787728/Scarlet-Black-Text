Mr Steiner's Lecture on TDlStOl.

Mr. Steiner’s lecture on Tolstoi
was especially valuable because he
looked at the man from so many
points of view,

There are many difﬁculties to be
overcome in getting into Russia.
The obscure place in which Tolstoi
livcshas been raised to prominence
on account of this one man.

Portraits seen of him present a
good likeness. His face belongs
to no particular race. His eyes
aresmall, nose too large, and his
cheek bones are prominent. His
inﬂuence has caused many to be
industrious and to cease from the
habit of drinking. He requires of
himselfto give everything and re-
ceive nothing. He believes the
SocialDemocracythe greatest en-
emy otmankind. Hisprinciplc is
thatyou must make yourself right
before you can make the world
right.

Tolstoi is well acquainted with
American literature and politics.
His library is well Filled with books
ofAmcricanauthors. Emersonis
a favorite.

He believes modern art clings to
Pagan ideals. Only that is art
which represents spirit. No such

ltor truth's sake. Tolstoi’s gieat
cry is “The Kingdom of God is
within you." He hasn’t the props
ei- view of Jesus, To him it mats
ters not who Christ was, but His
words are the words of God.

Scarlet and Black Honored.

It was with much satisfaction
that friends ot SCARLET AND
BLACK read the account conceln-
ing Pres. and Mrs. Gates in last
Sunday's issue of the Des Moines
Landry, The pictures used were
the same and the account given
was taken almost bodily from the
supplementof Nov. 3rd. SCARLET
AND BLACK is honored by havmg
its tribute to Pres. Gates, copied
by so great a paper as the Des
Moines Leader. This honor would
be more highly apprectated, hows
ever, itadequate acknowledgment
of its indebtedness had been made
by the Landry. Although it is a
matter of small consequence, it
seems hardly right tor a paper to
borrow so copiously trom another,
Without giving it any of the credit,

However tllere is to be no
quarrel with the Leader. Re-
membering the many times that
the Llalﬂ’l’ has defended the in-
terests of Iowa College. when
some otits contemporaiies were
disposed to criticise rather frecly,
we gladly pass over the present
instance of the Lmdcr'r failure to
do us justice.

Mock Trial.

At the meeting ol the Cliresto»

regular program was dispensed
with and the Lewis Literary and
the Elizabeth Barret Browning so~
cieties were invited to give their
joint program, which they kindly
consented to do. The program
was something new in society
work, consisting of a breach of
promise suit in which the plaintiff
asked for damages to the extent of
525,000. Miss Herron acted the
part of plaintiff. and James and
Dunn were her attorneys; while
Buck and Gonzales appeared for
the detendent, Beach. Barnard,
the president or the Lewis Lits,
acted as the “most honorable
judge,” and the jury was chosen
from the audience. They seemed
to be careful not to pcrjui-c them.

Gift from the Ladies.

The evening so pleasantly spent
by the young ladies at the gyms
nasium the Friday following Hale

enjoyment to them but as a result
the Athletic Association is the re-
