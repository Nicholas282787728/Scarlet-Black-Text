Calocagathia.

The program at Calocagathia
Friday atiernoon \vzts opened by
a pleasing piano duet by Miss
Helen Mtllerd and Miss May
Findley. '

The literary program consisted
of an extemporaneous debate, the
subject having been given to the
speakers a tow hours hetore and
thus a little while being allowed
for preparation. The' subject of
the debate was: "Resolved, That
Our Legislature Should Pass ii
Law Making Education Compulr
sory." and the speakers were meme
hers of the junior class.

The Fiist speaker on the afﬁrm
alive, Miss Ada Garst, spoke eas
ily and readily and presented
some good arguments. Among
other things she mentioned. as an
example, the decrease in juvenrie

Stontbt-calrer gave a good debate.
but conﬁned herself rather too
closely to notes.

Miss Ulivc Wilson took up and
relllled several points of the neg

Miss Lottie Dryden said that
the foreigners who are uneducated
come here for th'e most part after
they are too old to go to school
and are generally anxious to send
their children to school, so this
law would not help that problem.
Miss Dryden spoke very well.

The debate on the whole was
very good. and the speakers Show»

speaking.

It was announced at the last
