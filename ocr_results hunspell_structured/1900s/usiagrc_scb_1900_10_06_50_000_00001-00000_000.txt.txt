The program ivas an especially
interesting and instructive one,
Friday p. m., bringing to our at
tention the modern drama through
a close inspection of the life and
labors of one of its artists, Ibsen.
Ibsen's Realism was treated of by
Marie Sedwick in a most able and
intelligent manner. After hearing
a review of Boyesen's rather mild
and favorable criticism of Ibsen.
by Helen Leach, in which the
early life and environments of the
man were revealed, the society
listened to Nordan's bitter sarcas-
tic criticism of the dramatistgiven
by Grace Stonebi-eaker. Then
the society was allowed to form
its ownjudgment about the matter
by seeing a short scene from
“Lady from the Sea," in which
Miss Courtney took the part of
Ellida, Miss Kinniclc, VVnngcl, and
Miss Andrews the pail of “The
Stranger.” Miss Thompson kindr‘
ly ftirnislicd the music for the

 

afternoon.

Grinnell Institute.

Pres. Swan called the meeting
to order at 7:30 and appointed as
critic of the evening, Mr. Otis.

Mr. Morrison opened the pro-
gram with a talk on the new ath-
letic organization, which proved to
Contain valuable information.
Mr. Dickinson and Mr. Arnold
showed their originality by giving

a discussion in which many of the
important events of this year‘s col-

lege life were touched upon. Mr.
Condit then favored the society
with a vocal solo, He kindly re-
sponded to an encore. Mr. Lye
man read a paper on the American
jury system, which showed some
caretul preparation and study on
the question.

The debate of the evening was:
Resolved, that the Artie explora»
tions have not afforded results
worthyofjustifyingtheni. Trai
er upheld the aFﬁrmative and Crir
ley the negative. Dickinson,
HarrisandOtisvolunteered. The
judges rendered their decision in
favor of the negative.

At the business sess‘ ,thirteen
new members were i ated and
three voted in. The society was
glad to see so many visitors, who
are always welcome.

The program opened with an
enjoyable vocal solo by Miss
Porrerﬁeld. This was followed
by the roll call to which each
member responded by some piece
of current news, Apparently the
newspapers had not been consults
ed by many of them as most of
the news was of a very local
nature.

The second program on “Col-
leges and Universities" followed.
This week the subject was the tar
west, Leland Stanford University
being represented in a paper by
Eliza DeLong, read by Cressa
Lee, as Miss Delong was unable
to be present. The history and

present equipments ot the univerr
sity were very tully given. Lulu
Williams reviewed Colorado Col-
lege in a very interesting way,
compar‘ g the life there to our
oivn college life. After a well
rendered piano solo by Miss Mol-
lci- and the report of the business
committee the society adjourned.

The program next week will be
a short farce to which friends of
the society are cordially invited.
