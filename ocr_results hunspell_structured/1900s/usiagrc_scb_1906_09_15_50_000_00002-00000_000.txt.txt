Qégitorial

T husbeeu tlchustom forsomeyears
to publish a quantity of extra
copies of the disc three numbers of the
SCARLETASD BLACK and distribute
them freely so that each student
might hare a copy, Elery alumnus
whose address we have likewise gets El
a copy, Alter these three numbers
the paper is sent L0 subscribers only.
Besides subscribing freely there is an-
other way in which both students and
alumni can materially help in making
the paper more interesting both to
themselves and their friends. That.
is, in the matter or news, There are
many items Of interest. which escape
the reporters and alumni editors which
make excellent "copy.” We earnestly
request that everyone send in all such
items, not that the editor's work may
be easier, but that the SLARLET .«xD
BLAci; may mean more to every nioin-
ber of Iowa College. As we have said
before, this IS a sLuLleliL, not a person-
al enterprise, and it should uhrays be
kept so.
