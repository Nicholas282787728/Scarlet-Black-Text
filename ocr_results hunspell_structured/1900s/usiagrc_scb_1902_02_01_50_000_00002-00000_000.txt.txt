RESUME OF RECENT ATHLETIC
EVENTS.

The iailur-es or- successes oi a year's
athletics in lowa College will not be judged
by the alumni irorii the stand point or the
number or contests lost or woii ii the
suninium bonuni ol our athletics is victories
over our opponents we should at once diy
chalge our Board oi Athletic Control, ‘repeal

"Collegiate compact, disregard amateur athr
letic ethics and go down in our pockets tor
the wherewithal with which to sripply the
pressing demand ior “winners" it is not,
however, unpleasant to be able to announce
to the alumni that a itril share oi successes
have come tothe various learns olthe school
during the year ol 1901 just past. The re-
ports oi these contests have, honever,ap-

peared from tithe to time, not only in the‘

columns of the SCARLET AND BLACK and the
local press, but upon the sporting panes ol
the various metropolitan newspaper-s oi the
\vest,and it must he assumed that the tiiends
of the institution are lainiliat’ witlt the den
tails It is the purpose oi this report to
give only a general resuriie oi the year's
work viewed mainly limit its Iesults upon
the genelal life of the college and the bene~
l‘its resulting to the student participators.
‘For converri ice sake we will consider the
year’s athletics undel the heads at BlSdbAll,
Track, and Football.

BASEBALL.

The baseball season ot 19m was not all
that the alumni could have desired. There
was a lack oi esprit de corps. oI loyalty to
the traditions ol the institution upon the
part at the team. which was in iiraiiy r
spects deplorable aiid dishearteninu. Ran
ports reached some oi ns,unsnppoittd, it is
true. by evidence which is direct arid posie
tive. w ' i, itti-ne, were disgraceful, The
wri er is inclined to the beliei that these roe
ports were somewhat overdrawn, but is
doubtless true that they had some basis in
iact. This state oi aliairs is all the riiore
remarkable and disheartening when it is re
alized that many oi the men composing the
team have, iii other hianches oi athletics,
manilcsted the best oi spi land in some in
stances ari heroic devotion to college tradir
lions and training rules, Tire reason to be
ascribed lor- the conditions is hard to ﬁnd.
lt is the belrel oi the writer that it is largely

 

due to the tact thiit c'biilt liits been so
thoroughly appropriated by prolessionai
athletes that it has lost the amateui‘ Standing
and pure sport ideals that should pervade

The season of 19m in tiuck athletics was
highly satisfactory. Novel in the history
at theI College have more men had the bene-
ﬁts oi caretnl and soreiitiiic tianirrig than in
l90l. It ‘ not an exaggeralitiii to state that
itilly halt the men in the college reported
daily [or work under Trainer Watson, not
primarily with the hope of making the
team, but bdcaltse ol the great benefits to
be derived. The team that represented the
college at Attics and Des M 165 is deserv-
ing of all Credit for the enthusiastic and
loyal devotion riraiiiiested it brought
credit tothc college and won ulory forit-
self. A considerable improvement was
made in the physical weliare oi each mEm-
ber of the team as will be shown by an ill-
spection oi the record of weights, icing ex-
pansion, etc., kept by‘ the authorities but
which is too long to be set out here.
This branch of athletics is deserving of the
most hearty support oi every alumnus oi
the college,

The ioolball season just passed was ex-
cat’dingty creditable. The spirit displayed
by the team individually and collectively
has never been excelled in Griltliell. A vary
large number of the men 0! the institution
received the beneﬁts oi training and a gen-
eral improvement in the physical iveiliare
of the candidate: was noticed. No serious
inJuries can be reported with the exception
of that received by hallrback Lyman, and
this injury would have been avoided had
tiie proper headgeal been worn. while it
is to be desired that Sonic at this rougher
leatures oi the game may be eliminated, it
is still true that the uanic as now played is
resultinqtn good to the men and to the
school. It is productive of Irsults In “it:
way oi physical improvement and in the
development or sturdy and rugged char-
acter in the individuals, combined with an
intense collcgc spirit which cannot but
make tor good

ocncrtr REMARKS.

The \vlitcr has not dealt with the subject
or gymnasium work, basketball and tennis
(or the reason that he has little personal
knowledge oi these branches oi college
work and play, it is generally understood
and remarked that Mr, Davis is doing good
work in his line and that great ﬂood is
resulting to all the men of the illstlttl'
tiorr iroiri the rise oi the gymnasium.
Basket ball and tennis Each have a
large following and are to he encouraged
and suppoited. During the year a line third
cl a mildtmck has been hullt in \Val‘d Field,
which is a great improvement. The securr
lng oi the State High School Meet at G
ilc'll tniiigs the college in touch with many
young men ol the state and it is believed
that tllc‘ relations esta led bettteen the
cottage and the high schools \\'l result in
miltiliil beneﬁts The Grilmell star IS Cer-
tainly in the ascendancy and with the hearty
c0~opclation oi the “old timers" it can be
kept tlit‘lc. Let us all help the good work
along by a mariiiestatioii oi peisonal rrre
terest and by a tibeial response to appeals
for ltlnds.
