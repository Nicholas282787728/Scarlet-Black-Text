The Mid-year examinations at Her-
vard passed this year without ”gun
night." Harvard students have been
in the habit of collecting all the ﬁre-
arms available and discharging them
from dormitory windows, as a sign
that the dreaded Midyear tests had
begun. There was considerable talk
of renewing the Custom this year, but
no one could be found brave enough to
fire the first gull.

At a recent meeting of the Council
of Administration of tlle University

prohibit students from keeping bull-

SOCIETY FLAY CHOSEN.

The chresiomsfhian and Ellis Societies
will Present Edward Rosland's
Tragedyi“L'Aiglon."

The Clll‘estO-Ellis play committee
have decided to substitute in place of
Miss Morton’s little comedy “A
Bachelor's Romance," which they had
thought ofgiving, Edmond Rostand’s
greattragedy, and what is perhaps his
masterpiece, “L'Aiglon.”

The central ﬁgure is Duc de Reich
stodt, the 17 year old son of Napoleon,
who inherits all his father’s ambition
and ﬁre without his strength of per-
sonality. The boy Due is kept almost
:tsa prisoner at the Austrian court
and all knowledge of his father and
who he is are kept from him by his
grandfather. the Emperor of Austria,
and the Austrian prime minister, but
through secret friends the young
Prince learns his identity and of the
glories and triumphs of Napoleon and
is consumed With a desire to return to
France and regain his father’s power.
“L’Aiglon” is the story of a conspiracy
by his friends to carry Due to France
and place him upon the imperial
throne as Napoleon II. Tile attempt
fails and the last scene is the death of
the broken “Euglet.”

L’Aiglon was ﬁrst presented in 1898
and achieved remarkable success both
in Europe and America. The role of
the Due has been taken by both Maude
Adams and Sarah Bernhardt.

The Cost is not yet chosen but Will
be announced in a short time.

JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.

Among those most heenl y interested
in the recent English elections in
which the Chamberlain party, with
the exception of Joseph Chamberlain
himself, was overwhelmingly defeated.
was Professor Macy. “Joseph Cham—
berlain is a peculiar genius;" said Mr.
llacy recently, “he is the greatest
political ogva ' er in Great Britain
andIsuppose his wonderful triumph
in being returned from Birmingham
was somewhat in the nature of a per-
sonal one rather than atriumph for
the protective policy for which he
stood so strenuously. lie was the first
one to introduce American political
methods into England and, he has
gotten Birmingham so thoroughly
organized that ho is apparently a
ﬁxture hi the Commons. He was
there when I ﬁrst visited Parliament
many years ago and he gives promise
oi remaining there for some time. His
wife lsan American woman but he had
his machine organized and running
smoothly before he married her so did
not learn American politics from her.
Yes, I suppose oncoi the lessons orthe
recent election is that it is as di lcult
for the protective policy to make much
headway in England as it would be for
absolute free tratleto gain much sup.

SPRlNG ATHLETICS.

Some Dope Concerning the Prospects on
Track and Diamondi’l‘raining has Be-
gun ai Several Insrlmtions.

The failure of the groundhog to see
his shadow has caused the most opti-
mistic to hope for an early spring.
Among those who are beginning to
watch for the ﬁrst signs of spring are
the track athletes and baseball fans.
Already at lowa and Ames track meet
ings have been held and the Spring
training has commenced. Grinnell
has issued no Call as yet and will prob-
ably not begin for a few weeks.

At Ames. all is enthusiasm again
auda large Squad will Come out to
train under Jack. The Farmers think
that there are great possibilities in
their squad. MarcCatlinatIowalras
started business and indoor training
is the order of the day. Iowa wanted
an indoor meet with Grinnell but no
satisfactory date could be arranged
and the meet has been called oiI.
Trainer Fisher was not in favor of an
early date. Doc Monilaw is againin
the saddle at Drake and we can be as
sured of.a inst bunch at the Des
Moinesrscllool. The blue and white
will undoubtedly be afactor in the
spring meets.

'AL Grinrlell, no schedule has been
arranged but it is probable thatadual
with Iowa or Ames Will be held at
Ward Field, and one with Drake at
the Stadium, provided the track is in
shape. The season is so short that
the number of meets will necessarily
be limited. A duel with Coe is also a
possibility.

In baseball ell’cies all is Serene. A
schedule has been arranged by the
League and anulnbel‘ of good games
is assured. Town will havea strong
team. Ames has suil'ered the loss Of
seve ll veteran players and will have
to depend on new material largely.
Cornell‘s prospects are uncertain.
Grinnell wlll have seven old players
in uniform and there are several neW
men Who wlll be formidable CanidaLes.
Cage Work in the gymnasium will be
begun before long and all new men
will be given a tryout. Simpson
Will have dream this year and will
battle with the teams of the big four.

It is too early to tell what eﬂ'ect the
conference rules will have on till":
various schools. Charges of profession-
alism were rife last [all and it is prob
able that some or the Star men will
not be allowed to participate. Tile
strict enforcement of the rules Will be
received with favor by all the lovers
of pure athletics. The loss of a few
men from any of the squads would
make a great diliercnce in the out
come at the state meet. Itis more
than likely that these matters will all
be settled before the season Opens, as
all ale Opposed to the disagreeable pol-
icy oi' deferring charges or profession
alism unlil [he last moment. Such

matters can just as well be cleared up
elu'ly in the season.
