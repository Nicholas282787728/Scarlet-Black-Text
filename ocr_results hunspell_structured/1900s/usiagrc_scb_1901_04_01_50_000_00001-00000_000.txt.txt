The Concert at Eldorar

The seventh annual trip of the
Glee Club and Amphion OrcheSr
tra became a thing of the past ale
most as soon as it was begun, It
consisted of one number and two
encores, sung beforerthe High
School Declamatory Association
of twelve high schools on Friday
evening, and of a concert given by
both club and orchestra at the
Wisner opera house on Saturday
evening. The club received an
enthusiastic reception from the as-
sociation, Eldora being in especial
prominence.

Saturday morning a double
mule team succeeded in transport-
ing the club over almost impassa-
ble roads to the retorm school,
where they received a mostcourt-
eous reception, They were shown
through the school by one of the
staff. and were entertained by two
numbers of the reform school
band, consisting of boys almost

all of whom are under the age of
sixteen. The music they attempt-
ed and which they succeeded ad-
mirably in executing, was oi the
highest class, Mr. Miles, the su-
perintendent, entertained the club
with a short talk in which he
showed the policy of the institu-
tion to be that of reformation en-
tirely, and punishment a thing not
thought of, The club then sang
two songs betore all the boys as-
sembled for dinner, in a dining
room accommodating four hunr
dred and seventy boys.

In the afternoon the club was
entertained by Mr. and Mrs.
Charles McKecn Dnren and Miss
Fannie Duren at a ﬁve o’clock
reception and luncheon, which air
torded a very pleasant opportune
ity to meet Eldora people, ,

The orchestra joined the club

ﬁcuities in securing the bass
violins, began the concert at 8:30.

o'clock train down.

The concert. though not attend-
ed by a largeaudience,was listened
to by a very appreciative one,
which did much to make it a mo
cess.

Open Hour at Ladies’ Gymna-
slum.

For several years it has been
the custom of the most advanced
class in Gymnasium work to give
an open hour at the close of the
year's work. This year the date
has been placed for April 2, at
4:30.

Miss Raymond’s and Miss Par-
ker’s advanced classes will take
part. It might be well to state
that the girls do not wish the idea
to get abroad that this will be an
exhibition; on the contrary, it is
simply an open hour in which the
girls will go through their usual
drills ln marching. dumbrbells, etc.

The Junior and Senior boys are
invited, also the members of the
faculty and many townspeople.

Alter the regular class-room
work, the basket ball teams of the
two classes will have a game.

Chrestos Entertain the Ellisr

Fora great many years it.has
been the custom for the Chrcsto-
mathian and Ellissocieties to have

 

one or two joint meetings each
year. Last Saturday evening the
Chrestomathians were “at home”
to the Ellis society,and it was the
express purpose to have a social
good time. The meeting was en-
tirely informal from beginning to
end and the members of both so
cietics entered heartily into the
spiritofthe occasion, Duringthe
evening Miss Helen Thompson
sang avel‘y pretty little song from
Nevin and Mr. Walter Way gave
a comet solo. Both were so very
much enjoyed that encores were
insisted upon and kindly respond.

son also gave two r-ecitations in
her inimitable manner, which were
very heartily appreciated. Cards

city and ingenuity of those pres-
ent and the result was unusually
encouraging, Atterretreshments

The Chaminade Quartette.

The spacious and hospitable
home of Professor and Mrs. Noble
was the scene or two most delight-
ful social gatherings on Wednes-
day and Friday evenings ot last
week,andwillbelongremembered
among the pleasantest parties of
the season. Mrs. Noble and the
Chaminade Qtrattette, consisting
of Mesdames Vittum, Heidel,
Whitcomb and Miss Hill, were
hostesses, and after receiving their
guests gave a musical program
consisting ot six quartertes and
50105 by each member of the quarr
lctle. Thecnsemblegworkshowed
careful and painstaking study on
the part of the ladies, and the
voices blended beautifullyithis
was particularly apparent in La.
colne’s“Estudiantina,”the“Neld-
linger,” Rockrarbye” and in "Blue
Bells of Scotland,” all of which
weresung mostartistically.

Two novelties appeared on the

program: one, “TllcViolet,” words

by Professor Heidcl and sung by
Mrs. Heidel; the other, "May
Song." by Professor Whitcomb
and sung by Mrs. Whitcomb, both

poems set to music by Professor
Cole; and these as well as the oth-
or songs of each double number,
were sung with taste and ﬁnish.
Mrs. Vittum sang the beautiful
“Spring Song" ot Reinecke, with
violin obligate by Mrs. Heidel,
and this was greatly appreciated
Miss Hill’s two numbers formed a
pleasing variety and she was espe-
cially happy in her rendition of
Schubert's “Trout." Mrs. Noble,
who acted as accompanistbolh to
solo and quartette work, proved
again her ability in this direction
and was a most valuable aid to the
quartette.

After the program, refreshments
were served and the guests reluc-
tantly departed The house was
decorated with jonquils and the
thought of spring predominated
in the program. It is to be hoped
that the q'uartette may be heard
more frequently in public.

Jolnt Session at E. B. B. and
Lewis th.

The El 3.135 and the Lewis
Lits closed another term of suc-
cessful work in a joint session at
Institute Hall last Saturday even-
ing. A regular program was given
with Pres. Gonzales, of the Lits,
and Miss Churchill,vice-president
of the E. B. B.s, presiding, Each
one present responded to roll-call
with a personal conundrum invol—
ving some member of one of the
societies. A paper in archaic
English by Clark and a parody
on “Curfew Must Not Ring To-
night." by Buck, werethe features‘
of the evening. Owing to the
trip at the orchestra and glee club,
which took away a number of
members who were to have taken
part, the program was quite briet,
and in lieu of the missing numbers
the question, "Resolved, That
Women Should Have the Right
to Propose,” was given out for ex-
temporaneous debate. Dunn and
Hansen supported the afﬁrmative

and Clark and McIlrath the nega-
live. The issue was referred to
Prof. Davis, who decided in the
negative. After the program all
remained for a pleasant social
hour, Light retreshments were
served and a general good time
was enjoyed.
