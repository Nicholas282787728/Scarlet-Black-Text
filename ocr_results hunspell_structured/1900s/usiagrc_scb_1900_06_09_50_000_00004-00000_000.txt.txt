Foot Ball
The foot ball management takes

advantage of the last opportunity.

to again call attention to the plans
laid out {or next year. The sclledr
ule is an unusually heavy one. be
ginning at the very opening otthe
season with a hard game and con.
tinuillg it trntil the thanksgiving
game at Des Moines. The ﬁrst
date on the schedule is Sept. 23. a

d: triﬂe nrorethnn two weeks utter-
' school opens.

All possible ads
vantagesotcoachrng and Colldl-
tioning will be provided by the
management. But, it can be seen
at a glance, that no amount of
training can put a team in condr
tion on fourteen days’ notice.
Grinnell has never followed the
practice of having early season
work before the opening or the
school year. and we cannot do so
next tall. Yet it is pcrtccrly propr
er and sportsmanlike tor each man
to do a little private training.
Therefore, it behooves every old
man of the team. all nerv nren who
are contemplating lootball work.
and others who may enter in the
fall, to begin moderate exercise
dailyisay dllrlng the last week of
August. Let the work be light, but
regular and systematic. The re
sults otsuclr preliminary work will
be astonishing, and will enable the
coach to begin at once on the im~
portant task of coaching the men.

The ofﬁcials otthe football manr‘

agement are doing their best to
‘make next season’s football a suc~
‘cess. Let the men do their best
by IlCCdiilg the abovesnrali request

as to early training, and therrcorr
dition at the ﬁrst appearance on
the gridiron will be gratityrng to
both men and oﬂicidls

Institute.

The last rneetrug of the society,
which was devoted exclusively to
business. was called to order by
President Lindsay. From the
committee reports, it is on a bet
ter btlsls than ever befare. The
membership has reached its limit.
and even (luring the spring term,
when outside attractions become
more numerous, there has been a
large attendance. The society is
also on a good ﬁnancial basis; the
hall has been cnlirely renovated
during the past year, and there is
but a small deﬁcit.

Grlnuell Institute loses many
good society men by the graduar
tron ot the class of lgoo, and we
hope they may always hear pleas
Lint memories ot their work and
efforts in society. There are still
many good men in society and
there is more interest than heretor
fore. ‘

The tacnlty have granted per-
mission to hold meetings on \Ned-
nesday evenings and all augurs
well for a successlul year.

The following otﬁccrs were
