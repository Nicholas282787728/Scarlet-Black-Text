STATE ORATORICAL CONTEsT.

Friday evening, February 27.
the annual state oratorical contest
will be held at Uskaloosa under
the auspices ot Perm College.
This is event that arouses
general interest among the col-
legesof the state. and is particir
pated in by all the prominent
Iowa schools except the state in
stitutions. For two years the
contest has been won by Iowa
Wesleyan, while during these ttvo
years Grinnell has not even been
able to get into the contest. This
year Mr. Risscr, our representa
tive has succeeded in getting into
the Contest and will be the fourth
speaker Friday evening, He has
worked long and hard on his orar
tion and has spared no effort in
making it as perfect as possible.
Grinneli's or-aior deserves support
and all who can do so should go
to Ookaloosa anti help Mr. Kisser
win the stale course. A special
effort should be made on account
of the lack of interest here in the
past iewyears, and because Mr.
Risser deserves special recognir
tion on account of the difﬁculties
lindei which he hits labored.
