College is not doing right.
From the standpoint of training

alone violations of the most ordinr
ary rttles are committed openly

and continuously. It is the stur
dent opinion almost to a man that
the individual ball players are ex
cellent and exceptional perform
ers. but that the learn as a whole
has made a resold so far which is
far below their real ability to
malre. Thehistory ofevetygamc
shows that somewhere something
is wrong. and the student body is
not entirely blind to the precise
cause of the sudden weakening.
which seems to attack our men
invariably in the seventh or eighth
inning, When ball men use to-
bacco constantly and lteep late
hours they can not expect to play
ball. But this appears to be the
very thing they do expect to do.
It sometimes seems as though
some ball men are inptived solely
by the unpatriolic selﬁsh purpose
of having agood time on the trips.
no thought being given to the rep-
utation ottiie sehaul they repre-
sent. Such men are a damage to
younger athletes They ought to
take a brace. Ilt'ney don't do this
voluntarily the Board of Control
ought to make them. That is what

that it must make one ﬁnal
appeal in beltnlfol the attractions
which are offered to Grinnell peer
pie during the fore part or next
week. The unselﬁsh labor of the
actual promotor and the summit
which the business men have flee-
ly given to make this event a stre-
cess almost make attendance ob|i~
gatory upon students and citizens.
If every one turns ill and does his
share. the May Festival can easily
be made an annual event. A regs
tilar attraction of this krnd could
not but reﬂect great credit upon
Grinnell. But setting lde the
larger vteiv. no person ought to
miss such an opportunity. The
ﬁnest musicians ot this whole land
are gathered together in these
three concerts. They present as
high a grade of music as can be
heard anywhere and in any big
city. When allthis is offered at
a price nhich would appear rlLilCLl-
lottsly low to music patrons of an
eastern city. it is hard to under»
stand howor why anyone can stay
at home to save the expense.
From Gliilncll the soloists and the
Symphony Orchestra go direct to
