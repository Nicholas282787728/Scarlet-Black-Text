J B. HATCHER, SCIENTIST.

The ﬁrst volume of a work re-
cently from the press has been re-
celved in the library under the
personal signature of its author,
J. B. isiatcher. ex-‘Sz, who is cons
nected in hi scientiﬁc rescarch
wolk with the Carnegie Museum
of l’ittsburg. The work is cntit»
led Princeton Patagonian Expcdi»
tions 1896 99 and is a collection
of very interestingly writtcn re-
ports of the trip under the super
vision at Mr. Hatcher. The ob
ject at the expedition was for
scientiﬁc exploration natur»
al history and tor the collection
of specimens of vertebrate and in
vertebrate iosstls in Patagoria.
But aside from the important diss
coveries along this line the re-
sults of the journey have given to
the world many gcugraphlcal tacts
of which we have hitherto been
decidedly ignorant, This inter-
esting ﬁeld has been almost on.
tirely untouched and notwltl‘ls
standing the great difﬁculties arid
dangers which lllr.‘l*latcher had
to overcome, the expedition met
with distinguished success.

The volumes are elegantly ai‘s
ranged and no expense has been

spared in their making. Especial.
ly Fine are the halt tone engrav—
ings of views taken by the author.
The success of the work is largcs
ly due to the liberality of J. Plers
pont Morgan, Esq.
