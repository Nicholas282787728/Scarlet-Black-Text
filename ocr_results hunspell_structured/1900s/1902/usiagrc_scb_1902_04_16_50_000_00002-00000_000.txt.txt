the splendid work that these two
organizations can do tor the col-
lege: Athletic contests untlottbtr

every reason to ieet encouraged
,over the numbers that have come
to her as a result. Debates. ol‘ar
torical contests, and similul‘events,
likewise exert a strong irriluence
on certain prospective students.
But notwithstanding these, there

From the standpoint of advertise-

trip pays abundantly. Good work
has been done tor the college rn

in the future. It has appeared to

praises of old I. C. should be
sounded in communities outside

college organi7ations of the coun

should this reputation be conﬁned
to Iowa? Why should the inter-
ests oi Iowa College be limited by
the boundaries of one state?
Other institutions have sent their
Glee Clubs on extended trips, and
have gained materially by doing
it. During the last Christmas

Grinnell do likewise? This is a
question that is well worth care-

the largest possible number oi subr
