student body assembled in the
chapel and held a rousing mass
meeting, productive of much en-
thusiasm in regard to the Cornell
game today. speeches were made,
songs were sung and yells were
given, all of one tenor and pur~
port, that Cornell “delenda est”
and that in any event our visitors
must be treated royally and our
team supported loyally.

W, P. Bair presided and called
to order the largest crowd that
has assembled for such a purpose
for many a day. The room was
ﬁlled as for a Friday morning
chapel talkr Fres. Bradley was
announced and gave a short ad
dress expressing appreciation of
the team and hope for the
morrow. Any kind of ateam can
get along when victory is coming
its way but it takes nerve and
couragetor a team to hang to
gether through defeat after defeat
and play each game more ﬁercely
than the last. Our men have
shown unlimited pluck and played
the best there is in them and the
school back them with the same.
spirit.

The college quartetsang several
selections,among them, “Football
Joy." to the tune of the Alumni
Song, descriptive of the joys of
football. More speeches followed:
BF. Denison plead for the united
support of the school in all her un-
dertakings, Five hundred students

stitutions which are divided into
factions. Miss Hinkley spoke
for the girls and made an appeal
for bass voices in the grand stand.
Tratt gave a short talk about the
situation in general He assumed
his share of blame for our defeats
this year and had hopes that the
tide might turn. Several letters and
telegrams from loyal alumni were
read expressing the interest they
felt in the situation. One telegram
was from far off Harvard, signed
by the Grinnell Alumni there;
another from Captain Fisk of last
year’s team, reminding us how we
had always ”done" Cornell in the

past; a letter from former Coach

livered.

of acting as servants to men. To
minister well We must cultivate
honesty, which is not dishonest
with itself, humanity, love for
men backed by personal purity of
life and motive. knowledge of
things, of men, faith so strong as
to be knowledge of God, a prayer-
fulness which consists in satisfying
with life and labor that spiritual
hunger which mere words starver

At Friday morning's chapel
service Dl. Steiner made a plea to
the young men and women to

and beauty of their lives. not as
ends, but merely as means to the
higher end of “speakng ﬁily, in
the right season, words of_help to
the weary". ”Our lives must
speak kindness to express Divine
Love,"

But on Friday evening he ex-

Divine Love, itself, in all its
sacredness and beauty—as it
dwelt in Christ, as it dwells in all
who fulﬁll heavenly love in their
