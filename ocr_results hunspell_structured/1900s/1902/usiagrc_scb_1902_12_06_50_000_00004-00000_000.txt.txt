Y. w. c. A. BAZAR.

The Second Annual Christmas
Bazai' to be given by the Young
Women's Christian Association.
will beheld one week from next
Saturday night on December
Last year afatr was given as a
sort of experiment, and it was met
with such approval and success
that it was considered advisable
to at least repeat the experiment

if not to have it become a

niancnt feature of the Y. W. C. A,
work.

The new girls as well as the old
have responded enthusiastically
tollie invitations to contributc.
and much time and iiioilt 5 being
expended to make the fair as at.
tractive as possible. All . rts oi
dainty and useful articles suitable
for Christmas gifts will be offered
for sale. There will be an enorr
mous variety of posters, sofa
pillows. scarlet and black perk
nants etc.,

It. is to be hoped that it will
equal last year's fair in a ﬁnancial
way. Tile articles for the most
part are donated, and thus the
proceeds are pure gain _for the
association. The money thus
obtained is tor the purpose of
sending delegates to the Geneva
Conference, and it is greatly de-
sired that as large a delegation
can be sent next summer as iient
this year. Grinnell sent the
largest delegation of any of the
schools represented there.

Everybody is cordially invited
to patronize the lair. but a special
invitation is extended to the stu-
dents. '

THE NEW CHAPEL.

The new chapel is an assured
fact, altho the pledges for it are
not yet made. Preparations are
being made for an active carn-
paign ior subscriptions. and the
corner stone will probably belaid

before the end of the school year.
Letters are already being sent out
to those who gave for the men‘s
gymnasium. and other plans are
being matured to apply to other
friends of the college. While no
deﬁnite plans for the building
proper. general plans are in
hand; the litliltling will be located
on the vacant prtl'| of the campus.

this life that is worse than death.
Don Silva follows her and battles
hopelessly iiitli the I‘linty will ol
the Gypsy Chiel the result being
a ﬁnal spiritual triumph tor both.
The play otters much variety
in settings and situations. A bright
element is introduced through
the action otthe gypsy maidens
and the mass scenes, and the arr
rangemeut of the poem is one
that offers opportunities for a
most successful presentation.

SEMI-CENTENNIAL POSTPONED.

Owing to the number of events
occurring before the holiday va-
cation in which the college is di-
rectly interested, the exercises
incident to the Celebration of the
fiftieth anniversary of the exist-
ence of the Clirestomatliian Soclr
ety will be postponed till the early
part of the winter term, Dr.
Gershom H. Hill, of Des Moines.
has been secured as speaker for
the afternoon program and in the
evening a banquet will be given
to the old members and friends.
Over two hundred invitationshave
been sent to Alumni who were
formerly members of the society
andit is expected that the occa-
sion will be well worthy of the
oldest literary society in the west,
