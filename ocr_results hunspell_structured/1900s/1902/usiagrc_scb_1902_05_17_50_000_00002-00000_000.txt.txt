ACADEMY DEBATE TONIGHT.

Although we have previously
annouiicetlthe Academy debate in
these columns, we wish once more
to bring it to the attention of the
student body. The reason is that
the Academy both needs and de
serves your support in ils under
takingtoiiight. TlieAcndeniysor
ciety has far greater difﬁculties to
contend with than any of the col~
lege socteties. The members are
younger and less experienced and
their term ot membership is much
shorter. Thegreatiniajorityenter
the Academy in the senior year
and thus have only one year (or
society work.

But in spite of all discourage-
ments, the Lewis Literary boys
have maintained a good society
this year. They have gotten up
this debate on their own initiative
and whatever credit is to be gain-
ed from it belongs to them alone.

As is always the case, there is
considerable expense connected
with the debate. The members
of the two college societies had to
make up a goodsized deﬁcit atter
the recent Washburn debate. This
should not be true of this debate.
The debaters need the encourage-
ment of the student body and
should receive it tonight.
