MAX CDNGER OUT.

Sprinter's Break Will Keep Him out or
Spring Athleti A. Great Loss
to Grinncll.

A hard blow was given to our
hopes of having a strong track
team this year when it was learned
that Max Conger, winner of ﬁrst
place in the hundred and second
in the two twenty at last year's
state meet, had sustained an in-
jury which will surely keep him
out of athletics for the rest of the
season with the barely possible
exception oiihestate meet. What
is known as a sprintcr's break has
appeared in the back or his right
It
was ﬁrst noticed by lrirnseli last

leg slightly above the knee.

Thursday while he was turning

loose a little of his speed and has
grown steadily more and more
serious. The case is under the
care or Dr. sonrers who promises
us no more of the services ot our

star sprinter this year. Max may

possibly be ready tor one event at
the

the state meet. although
chances are slight.

FINANCIAL SUCCESS.

Lecture Course Debl has been Paid and
a Good Surplus is on Hand.

At the beginning of the (all
term, the outlook for this season's
lecture course was very gloomy
indeed. The expensive course of
the previous season, although well
supported, had left a deﬁcit to be
made up in the succeeding season.
and although the worlt was pushed
with vigor. the sale of the course
tickets was very disappointing
The students gave it morc loyal
support than ever, but the towns
people had turned trom their air
legiance, and in the majority of
instances, were resolved to give
their aid to the series of entertains
ments about to bc inaugurated in
the new opera house. To make a
bad matter worse, the opening
number of the course. the lecture
by Lorado Tait, failed to materiar
lize on the date scheduled for it
and the cup of Sorrow ﬁlled to
overﬂowing for the lecture course
commitlee. The missinglecturer.
however, appeared two days later,

and gave an excellent lectule.
The tide now set in in the other
direction and the cash sales at sucv
ceeding lectures swelled to unc.
pecled amounts. The illness
which pl'cvcnted Dr. Van Dylze
irom keeping his appointment was
regrcttcd as deeply by the comr
mittec as by the public. No doubt
Grinncll will have an opportunity
of hearing him some time in the
near future. For the four num-
bers that were given, the commit-
tee has no words to say. They
were of the quality that speaks for
itself.

At the close of the season it was
evident that success had crowned
theeftortsotthecommittee, The
expenses current for theyear were
paid in full and the debt to the
church tor rental was tnund to
exist only in the [ears of those
responsibleforitspayment, Conr
sequerrtly the management has
the gratiﬁcation of turning over to
the Y. M.C. A.. as a fund to be
devoted to next year's course, the
sum of Sll8.12, with no debt or in
cumbrance hanging over the urn

jUNIOR ANNUAL

The time approaches for notice
of the annual production of the
Juniors. 1903 decided to publish
a book and the publication is now
well under way. Most of the ma»
terial is now in the hands of the
printers and members of the board
are busy correcting the proofs
sheets. As yet no date has
been announced for the sale of the
books. The price will be 51.50
and already most of the copies
ordered have been sold.

The Annual this year is planned
to keep up the traditionsot college
annuals, inasmuch as it is to be a
sort of picture or college life and
a history of the last college year.
To give the Ammo! of this year
added interest special emphasis
has been laid on certain depart
ments of our college life which are
to be treated more fully than ever
before. The book is also to have
more sketches and prclrlres than
usual. A little later SCARLET AND
BLACK will give a more extended

 

review of the Ammal.

SECOND ANNUAL FEED.

Scarlet and Black Starrand invited Guests
Hold Banquet. 7 Excellent
Toasts are Giveni

The annual banquet otthe SCAR-
LET AND BLACK Staff was given Sat-
urday evening at the Citipin
House. The members of the stah‘
of the college paper receive poor
pay andlittlethanksfurlheir work,
but all who were present Saturday
night felt that they were fully re-
paid for all the work they had ever
done on the paper. After the
dinner, Dean Main, Mr. Cowden
and Samuel Strauss of the Des
Moincs Leader gave addresses.
Mr. Main spolrc on the place of the
paper in college lite, and Mr.
cowd‘cn gave a very helpful and
interesting talk about the practical
side of college journalism. Mr.

The ﬁrst newspapers practically
depended upon charity tor‘ their
existence. It was thought that
each neighborhood should have a

papers were newspapers and noth»

advertising business was done, but
only as a side issue to the main
businessotselling news. Butalong
in the latter part of the '80‘s began
the great advertising era. Men
saw that if political and religious
ideas could be impressed upon the
people by repetition in the news-
papers, so could ideas about cer-
tain goods or certain ﬁrms. And
so the advertising became the
source of proﬁt to the owner of the
