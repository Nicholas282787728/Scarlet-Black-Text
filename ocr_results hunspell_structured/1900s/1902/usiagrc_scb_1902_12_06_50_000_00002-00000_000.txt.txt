HIS year the opportunities
for a successful oratorical
contest are unusual, and the men
on the Contest have been working
exceptionallyhard. Theoratlons
this year are well prepared and
are stronger than the ones of the
last tew years. Tosliow thespirit
of the college in these matters
now, the men who enter the cone
testmust have a good crowd. We
only have one such contest a year,
and it ought to be ot enough imr
portance to draw out most ot the
students in college. The at-
tendance at the home contest is
never what it should be and this
year offers a chance to make a
new record. Iowa College will be
proud to see a strong representa-
tive at the state contest, but slur
dents must recognize that this
demands support and inleiest. A
half healled home contest is a
certain indication that Grinnell’e
chances at the slate contest will
be poor. Three or tour interested
men cannot make a good llomt:
contest nor an enthusiastic iiitcrr
