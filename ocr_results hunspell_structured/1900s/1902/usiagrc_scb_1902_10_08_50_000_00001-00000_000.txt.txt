A CENSUS 0F RELIGIOUS PREFER-
ENCES.

A Census DI Students to be Taken by the
Christian Assnciatrons Under
Faculty Ansprces.

There has up to date been no
record of the religious preferences
of the students in ‘our institution.
In:many institutions. including the
State University of our own state,
suchslatisticsareobtainedthrough
the regular registration, and by
vote of faculty, that will be done
after this year in connection with
our own registration; but the mat-
ter having been thought of too
late this year, the faculty has rec-
ommended that the Y. W. C. A.
and tlieY. M. C. A. obtain the data
this tall. These Olganizations,
thereiore, will appoint committees
to wait upon the students.

The statistics are to cover not
merely church membership, brrt
in case a student rsnota membei oi
any denomination, the cirureh
which the student has been in the
habit oi attending or preters to at-
tend.

The object of obtaining these
datais to give an opportunity for
thetnost efﬁcient administration to
the religious and social needs of
the students by the organizations
with whichthey are :iFﬁliated. The
various dcnonrrnatrons represents
ed in the city will be glad to trelp
to make the students feel at home
in Grinnell, it they can obtain the
necessary data. Iowa College is
glad of the growing complexity of
the religrous representation in the
college and wants nothrng more
than that the students may be
made at home and useful in their
own respective churches. The
ideal oithc college is surely broad
enough to include tirern aii, lrre-
spective oi denomination, and the
college looks tor greater richness
iromthe respecting and cherishing
of such diversity. We hopc.theres
tore, tor practical reasons. as well

as for the general interest in all
departments of college life, that
the students may cooperate to
makc thc task of the Chrrstian Ass
soclations, undertaken m bchalt
oi the college its a whole. as easy
as possible. Tire omcers who will
irave general supervisron oi the
work are Mits Charlotte Davis,
president of the Y.W.C.A..and M r.
W. K. Stacy, president of the Y.
me A. Special committees will
be announced later.

 

lOWA COLLEGE GRINNELL

DRAKE GAME.

The Team Makes an Encouraging
Showing.

A worse day could hardly have
been chosen tor a tootball game
than last Saturday proved to be.
The Field had almost no drainage
and was so ﬂat that water stood
on it in some places about three
inches deep. To the spectators it
was a very unsatisfactory game.
for even those who braved the
rain to go out on the side-lines
could not recognize the players
through the mud.

The advantage or the muddy
ﬁeld was clearly in Drake's favor,
as her team averages scvcral
pounds heavier. Taking this into
consideration, Grinnell has not
very much to lcgret over the re-
stilt ot the game. Tire teams
would be much more evenly
matched on adry, hard Field. and
there is good reason to believe
that the result may be different at
the Thanksgiving game.

The penalties were few, and all
but two of them were against
Drake. Grinnell was penalized
twice for ﬁve yards by the of srde
take, Thc signal would be given
and then a pause would follow
durrrrg wiricha Drakc man would
jump back trorn the line without
the ball being snapped. When
the Grrnrrell man had charged the
ball would be snapped, making
thc Giinncll man offside.

With both teams the game )Vas

THE CHAPEL ORGAN,

Splendid New Organ Dedicated
Last Sunday.

The organ dedrcated at Vespers
Sunday afternoon isa model of
beauty and mechanical skill. It
occupies the southwest corner of
the chapel loom where the old
voealion stood so long. and ﬁlls
a space thirteen by ten teet reach-
ing to the ceiling. Thetrontpipes,
thirty-ﬁve in all, are covered with
aluminum bronze which makes a
beautiful soft silvery effect, har-
monizing ricllly with the oak work
of the case. The stde iacrng the
platform is made in ltvo great
doors of heavy oak grill work.
reaching to the cerling. They
open on hinges and give a com-
plete view cl theinterior workings
of the organ, a ieaturc very useiul
to organ students.

Tire value or the organ to the
life and work of the college is im-
mense, and probably no single ad»
dition to the equipment ot the
college involving a similarsum oi
money would have added so mlich
torts general comfort and useful
Frequent recitals
will probably be given.

I’res. Bradley paid a high tri-
bute to those whose generosity
had made this organ possrble, and
to Mr. Matlack. whose untiring
energy had caused the demand
for it, aroused the interest iir it,
and pushed it through to such
early completion. His organ
numbers were thoroughlyenjoyed
by all and his recitals will be anti-
cipated with a great deal of in-
terest.
