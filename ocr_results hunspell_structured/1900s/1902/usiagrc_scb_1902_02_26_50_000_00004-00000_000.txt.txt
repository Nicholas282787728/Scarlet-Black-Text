SENIOR-SOPHOMORE PARTY.

The annual paity given by the

Sophomore to the Senior classl
was held Saturday night in the
Rand gymnasium and it can bc

said without the slightest hesitas

tion that it was :1 gr rand success. iﬁ

The scheme throughout was to

imitate a libuith of July cclcbin 1

tiou and to this end speeches

were made 111 good old ordet1
had been allﬂngetl in

which popcorn, lemonade and
whistles could be bought with the
paper money handed totlleguests

at the door, while 111 otllercornelsy/i ,, 1.1035,,“

were nigger babies and the shell
game.

The music llllnisllcd by the
“lube” band probnbly atltled rnorc‘
to the entertainment than any»
thing else. This was the initial
appcai-ance of the Grinnell Squirt
Band, roccntly organized aniong‘
the students for tl1c purpose of
playing at college athletic events,
and they quite outtlid themselves,
with their ﬁne playing. l

Shortly aitcr ten o'cloclt tables
were set and a three course lun-
Clloon servcd. Miss Hardin, thel
president of the Sophomore class,
then gave a toast to the Seniors,
and the iricndly feeling betu-eeni‘
the two classes was strengthened
by glvlng each otliors' cla y ~lls,
The pa1ty iias well planned and
carried out, and gym Credit is
