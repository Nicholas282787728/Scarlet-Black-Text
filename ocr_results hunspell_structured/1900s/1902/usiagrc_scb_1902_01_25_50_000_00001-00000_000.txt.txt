GYMNASIUM MEET.

No Meet with Iowa This Yeah—Western
intercollegiate Meet at Madison on
‘March 7.2.

There will be no gymnasium
meet between the State University
and Grinnell this year. Such. at
least, was the content of a letter
received recently by Prof. Davis
The

reason tor this is not given, but

from Director Rule of Iowa.

the decision of the Iowa director
comesasadistinctdisappointment
to many Grinnell students who
have been eagerly awaiting the
second contest between the two
schools in this line of athletics.
The contest last year resulted in a
decisive victory for the local team.
and it was conﬁdently expected
that a good showing would be
made in this second contest. But,
so far as the team is concerned, the
disappointment felt over the can-
cellation of the meet with Iowa is
more than offset by the prospect
ottaking part in the Western Inter-
collegiate Gymnasium Meet to be
held at Madison, Wisconsin, on
Marchzz. Thismeetiscalledup
on the invitation ofDr. J. C, Elson.
physical director at the University
of Wisconsin. There is at present
no intercollegiate organization for
the purpose oiholding contests of
this kind, but it is hoped at the
meeting in March to etiect a per-
manent organization.

According to the invitation from
Dr. Elson, the contest will be in
ﬁve eventsmhorlzontal bar,
parallel bars, rings. horse. and
tumbling. In all these events.
Grinnell has some good men who
are capable of successfully look
ing after her interests. The men
are doing some hard, consistent
work, and great improvement
may be looked for during the two
months which must pass before
the meet takes place. The team
has already elected its captain.—
this honor going to ],G. Wallescr.
’03.

In addition to this meet the
team will probably give an
exhibition meet with Drake at
Des Moincs. later in the year.
This will not be a contest, but
simply an exhibition performance,
and will probably be given in the
Auditorium. '

 

BASEBALL SCHEDULE.

Baseball Managers Metar rowa Ciry Yes- .

terday iThe Provisional Schedule tor
Grinnell.

Accoitlingtotlie announcement
made in Wednesday’s SCARLET
AND BLACK, the managers of the
leading college baseball teams of
the state met at Iowa City yesterr
day. There were representatives
present from ten institutions as
follows: Upper Iowa University,
Iowa State College, State Normal,
Coc,Coriie|l,Wes|eyan University,
Simpson. State University. Grin-
nell. and Knox College of Galesr
burg, Illinois.

The only matter ot business
which came before the meeting
was the arrangement or the schedr
ules for the coming season. It
was expected by some that the
question of admitting Simpson to
theleague would be discussed, but
this was not considered.

The schedules as arranged are
only provisional, as they must be
approved by the local authorities,
but it is believed that the ﬁnal
schedules will be substantially
the same as those prepared by
the managers at their meeting
yesterday. The provisional
schedule for Grinnell. as arranged
by Manager Dickinson. isa heavy
one. involving three short trips.
and ﬁfteen games in all. Five of
the games are announced for the
home grounds It is probable
that this may be slightly changed
by the Board of Control. But
whether changed or not it is evi-
dent that some hard work must
be done by the team, it it is to
make a good showing against the
teams indicated by the schedule.
The provisiorial schedule is as
follows:

DAY OF PRAYER.

Date changed From january 16 to
February glinr. Graham Tay.
Ior to be Plesent.

It has been the custom in Grins
nell to hold the day of prayer on
the last Sunday in January, but
this year a different date has been
chosen, The exercises will be
held on February 9, instead of
january 26, as expected.
This change has been made in
order to secure the presence of
Dr. Graham Taylor. who could
not Come atthat time. Dr. Taylor
needs no introduction to Iowa
College, No one could be found
who would prove more satisfactory
to the students. This will be the
third day of prayer. which Dr.
Taylor has spent in Grinnell, and
all who heard him on his former
visits will be pleased to know that
he is to have charge ot the ser-
vices again.

PROFESSOR WILLET WILL PROB—
ABLY VISIT GRINNELL.

All hope of securing Professor
Willet, of Chicago University, for
a series of addresses before the
students, had been given up until
Monday morning, when word was
received from him, sayingthat he
would cancel some of the other
engagements in order to come to
Grinnell. This is welcome news
to Grinnell people. Dr. Willet
is the Dean of the Divinity
School of Chicago University, and
is spoken of very highly 35.2
scholar and lecturer. His visit to
Grinnell promises to be of excep-
tional interest and importance.

7 .. ,
STUDENTS CONFERENCE.

The regular meeting of the Con-
ference in History, Political
Science and Sociology will be
postponed until Februaiy 3rd on
account of the lecture by Mr.
Riis.

It is proposed to make a sttidy
ot the South American Republics
during the next semester. The
increasing commercial importance
of South America and the intir
mate connection between the two
continents of the new world that
is likely to result from the propose
ed interoceanic canal, give a spec
cial interest to the study of their
political and commercial rela-
tions.

 

A DEBATTNG COACH.

A Movement on Foot to Secure a Coach
tor the Team Which Will Meet
Washhurn.

Shalltheteam which meetsWash-

burn in the intercollegiate debate
have the assistance of a debating
Coach? This was the question
which was considered by the Des
hating Union at its meeting last
Wednesday evening. There is a
strong reeling among the members
of the union that better training
should be given the team than has
hitherto been provided, and this
feeling is responsible fortheaction
ot the union in appointing a com-
mittee,consistingof G.R,Van Dike
from Grinnell Institute and S. H.
Crosby from Chrestomathia, to in»
vestigate further as to the advisa-
bility orsecuring a debating coach.
The work of the debating coéch 's
an essential part of the debating
interests in some of our best col-
leges and universities, and the
movement to secure an ofﬁcial of
this kind for Grinnell is indicative
of the growing interest and enthu-
siasm in our intercollegiate de-
bates. .

The services otth’e coach are set
forth in the tollowing statement
which has beengoing the rounds of
the college papers, and which is to
beaccredited to the HarvardCyim-
smi:

“Probably few realize the value
of the services of the debating
coach. Unlike the coaching at
athletic teams, his work is very in-
conspicuous, but it is nonetheless
essential to the development of a
good team. The men who are
picked tor the team must otcourse
do the work ntgathcring evidence
and learning thoroughly the
ground which is to be covered, but
it is almost invariably found that
the men, having chosen their side
and worked up evidence to sup-
port it, becomeso fully convinced
of the strength of their own posi»
tion that they fail to realize the
strong pointsor the other side and
their own weaknesses. It is at this
stage that the coach does his best
service. He sets the second team
to building up an opposite case,
and takinghiiuselfan unprejudiced
point of view he is enabled to pick
out all the weak points of his
team, to give proper emphasis to
