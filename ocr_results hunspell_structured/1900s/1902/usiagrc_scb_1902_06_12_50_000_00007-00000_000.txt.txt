given by Henry Lyman. He spoke
of the characteristics of the ivy and
their ﬁtness as models for his class
mates to imitate. The ivy secured
for the planting came from the walls
of Washington’s home at Mt. Vernon,
and was obtained through the kind-
ness and inﬂuence of Major Lacey.
The ivy was planted, a song was
sung, and then as the class marched
by each one placed a handful of dirt

on the young plant, and the exercise ,

was at all end,

ATHLETIC UNION MEETING.

The Athletic Union held an impor-
tant meeting Saturday morning. Mr.

ber of the board of trustees, that the‘

Union pass a resolution requesting
that John P. Watson be appointed
gymnasium director in the place of

Prof. Davis who recently resigned.‘

it was unanimously carried.

The constitution and conditions for
wearing the honor “G" were reported

Clark was elected president, Crowley
Cole vice president, L. L. Ricketts
secretary and treasurer and E. H.
Spanlding as student member of

Evera, Cole, Benson and Gilchrist.

captain and manager of the track
team and Fillmore and Wilson as
captain and manager of the basket

SENIOR PLAY.

in spite of the storm early in the
evening the class play was well at»
tended. When the curtain rose at
8:45 every seat in the Colonial was
taken and chairsavere placed in every
available place.

“A Midsummer Night’s Dream" is
not an easy play for amateurs to pre-
sent, aside from the interpretation of
the parts, for more than half of the
action takes place in the woods by
moonlight. The great success of
these difﬁcult scenes reﬂects milch
credit upon the stage manager, Mr.
Turner, and his assistant, Mr. Case.
The rising moon, although somewhat
hasty in her ﬂight, gave a decidedly
realistic touch to the scene,

The favorite of the evening was
Margaret Scammon in the role of
“Puck.” She was singularly well
suited to the part, arid her elﬁsh ways
called forth applause from the audi-
ence whenever she appeared,

Henry Lyman as ”Bottom shared
the favor of the audience with Miss
Scammon. The clowns, at all times
very funny, were at their best in the
ﬁnal production of their play before
the Duke, during which the audience
was convulsed with laughter.

Mr. Case and Mr. Chase as Demet-
rius and Lysander, the rival lovers,
carried their parts well. Mr. Nollen

GEORGE A. GATES. D. D., PRESIDENT 138771900

 

as Egens, the irate father of Hermia,
made a decided hit. Jay Clarke as
the Duke and Helen Millard as Queen
of the Amazons interpreted their
parts with conspicuous ablility. The
Fairies, big and little, from King
Oberon and Queen Titania to Pease
Blossom and Mustard Seed were all
that could be desired and added much
to the beauty of the woodland scenes.
The costumes throughout were beau-
tiful, and the play as a whole was
the most elaborate and successful
presentation of a Shakespeare drama
ever undertaken by the students of
lowa College.

BASEBALLrALUMNI vs. 'VARSITY.

Two games were played, the ﬁrst
one, on Monday, giving the college
team the victory by a score of 8 to 0.
Somers and Davis for the Alumni
and Fillmore and Marsh for the Val--
sity were the batteries. Fillmore
pitchedasteady game and did not
allow the Alumni a single hit, though
two men were allowed to get to sec-
ond base. Tuesday the second game
was played with Doe in the box and
Lew Rinefort behilld the bat for the
Alumni. The game was again an
easy victory for the college by 9 runs
to 0. in both games several subs
were played on the ’Varsity as sev-
eral members of the team had gone
home, intending to return only for
the Ames game Wednesday.

AN IOWA COLLEGE SONG,

The Unit Prize ror u orinrien stint; was
Awarded to the Following, by

Let foes oppose and come to meer us;

They'll have to grit and grind to bcaius.

They‘ll ﬁnd us like one mighty arm

To hold you sure and tree iroi-n harm,

When vain is all the force and Fight,

With nothing but defeat in sight,

They give the iee| a ﬁrmer stand,
And grlp the tighter every hand

or those that love Grtnncll.

All that is good wt hope lot you;

God keep your spirit strong mid |ruci

A heart-united band at might

That stands by what it thinks is right,
Grinnell, good old Grinneil.

 

m
TI-IE SILVER BAT.

By defeating Ames at Des Moines
yesterday in one of the best games of
the season, Grinnell won the best clailn
on the silver bat for 1902. Iowa re-
fused to play off the tie of Ames, Iowa
and Grinnell and should forfeitto Ames
and Grinncll. The matter will be
settled at the meeting of the executive
committee of the State College League,

 

probably in Grinnell’s favor.

 

ALUMNI BUSINESS MEETING.

Owing to the prolonged session at
the alumni banquet, the business meet-
ing which had been announced for
four o'clock (Wednesday) in the
Chapel, did not come to order until
nearly 5:30. H. W. Hughes, ’92,
president of the Association, presided.

The ﬁrst matter considered was the

 

election of an Alumni trustee. F. L
Heiiiott,the retiring member, being the
only nominee, he was unanimously
elected to succeed himself. The com»
mittee appointed last year to devise a’
new method of electing the Alumni
trustees reported that it did not have a

,plan quite ready, and was continued

for another year.

in regard to the admission of grad-
Mates of the School of Music to mem-
bership iii the Association, the com-
mittee appointed to investigate report-
ed adversely. The report was adopted
but the committee was instructed to
evolve solne plan for bringing these

, and also ex-students of the college

who are not Allrinlii, into social touch
with the Association.

The athletic committee gave an
optimistic report. in spite of the new
track arid other improvements, the old
debt has been btlt slightly increased
during the year.

The following oﬂﬂcers were elected
for next year:

PresidentiMrs. M. G. Mears, ‘81.

Vice-Pl‘csidelrtiJ, P. Ending, ‘89.

SecretaryiM, H. Douglass, ’95.

TreasureriH. H. Robbins, ’69.

Members of Athletic Board of Con-
troer, E. Somers, ’94; Chas. Raw-
son.

ALUMNI AND INAUGURAL
BANQUET.

The banquet Wednesday afternoon
was very successful in spite of the
rainy weather. The attendance was
very large and the main ﬂoor of the
men’s gymnasium was crowned with
alumni, students and friends. It was
a notable gathering of Iowa College
people, calculated to arouseenthusiasm
for their alma mater in the hearts of
many a one who had not seen Grin<
nell in years. Short speeches were
given for about three hours, members
from nearly every class that has grad-
uated from Iowa College being among
the speakers. College colors, college
reminiscences, college spirit abounded,
and the reunion showed the love for
our college that ﬁlls the heart of many
a man and woman far away from the
college walls. Congratulations to the
college and the new President were
freely expressed and hopes declared
that the future would offer even
better things to Grinnell than she had
CVEI' seen.

ALUMNI ADDRESS.

The address before the Alilmni As»
sociation was given Wednesday ev-
ening by Judge Ware, '86, of Oma-
ha. The threatened storm in the
early part of the evening kept many
away and only a small audience
greeted the speaker, After the invo-
cation by Rev. J. P. Burling, ’89,
Mrs. Mary Mack Heidel, ‘94, rendered
a delightful vocal solo. Mr. Hugh
Hughes, or West Liberty, president of
the Alumni Association, then intro-
duced the speaker of the evening.
The general subject of his address was
