COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER.

Professor Royce at Harvard secured for
the Commencement Address.— A
Great scholar.

Dr. josiah Royce, prolessor oi
philosophy in Harvard Univen
sity, has promised to collie to
deliver the commencement ad
dress next. Julie. This will pay
Harvard’s debt of last year, when
Professor Palmer was prevented
by illness from meeting his ens
gagement. Professor Royce is a
graduate of the University of
California and a Ph. D. of Johns
Hopkins. He instructor
attire former institution before
he was called to Harvard. As
professor at Harvard he rapidly
rose to the position of one of the
most eminent men in his special
work at our time.

Among the most important of
his philosophical publlcationsatc:
“Religious Aspccts of Philoso~
phy," which gave him interna-
tional reputation as the champron
of idealism; the ‘ﬁSpirit of Modern
Philosophy.” which unites crit»
ical and literary ability to all ex-
tent unequaled by any other in
troduction to the history of phi»
losophy; the "Conception of
God"; ”Good and Evil" and other
essays;and last and most com-
prehensive otthem all.the“\Voi'|tl
and the Individual". the Gifford
lectures in two volumes, being
the ﬁnest statement of the idealiSr
tic position ever made. The Gll'r
ford lectures are delivered at the
Scottish Universities on the Gite
ford foundation, the most (lls-
tinguishcd men in the world in
the lines of philosophy alld re-
ligion being called. Professor
Royce was the ﬁrst American
called to lecture on this tounda~
tion, Professor James being next,
both of Harvard. Besides the
works above Professor Royce has
published several magazine arti.
cles on philosophical and educa-
tional subjects.

In prolound mastery of his ﬁeld
and consummate dialectlc skill lli
prcscntinghrs arguments l’rotesr
sor Royce is unequaled, at least in
the English speaking world, at the
present time; and as a dialectician
he ranks well with the great
masters at that art, Plato and
Hegel. Moreover, with philoso-

A POLICE REPORTER.

Jacob A. Riis, “the Man that Docs Same.
thing," Will Lecture Here Monday
Evening.

When Prof. Main spoke of the
persons who were to appear. on
this year's lecture course as men
who are tiring something in the
world, he doubtless had jacob A.
Riispal'liculallyin mind. Certain-
ly it is true that in the line of
practical reform, few men of this
generation have accomplished
more or better things than has the
police reporter of the Mao Var/d
Sim. What has been brought
about, largely through his person-
al efforts, for the betterment of
conditions in New York, is little
short of marvelous. and it isot this
work that he will speak Monday
evening in his lecture, “The Battle
with the Slums."

Mr. Riis’s reforms have been ac-
complished largely by means of
his newspaper work; ior by pros
iession he is not a reformer. but a
reporter, and as such he has the
knack of telling his story in an the
terestingway. Thelatestexarnple
of his gift in this direction is his
autobiography, “The Making or
an American," which is now re~
Celvlng an unusual amount of ate
lention lrom the reading public
and the reviews. It is an exceeds
ly readable book, not only because
Mr. Riis's life itself has been full
of interest. but because ofthe lnilﬂr
ncr in which the story is told,
Those who have read it are the
ones most eager to hear and sec its
author, and it Mr. Rlls is able to
put into his leoturcone haliofthe
charm of his autobiography, the
event will be one or rare interest.
as it certainly will be of much
proﬁt as well,
