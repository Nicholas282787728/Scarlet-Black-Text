Grinnell, Iowa, Sathrday, March 22, [902

@hitori at

HE basketball game last
Monday afternoon at the
Gymnasium exhibition, closed the
season for the Grinnell team. So
far as the team itself is concerned,
there need be no hesitancy in
saying that the season has been a
successful one. The men have
worked hard and faithfully, and
although their defeats outnumber
their victories, they have repre-
sented the college well. They
have played clean ball, and have
done much to increase the interest
in this winter game, The part
which the students have lint] in
the season's work has not been so
satisfactory. Very little genuine
interest has been felt, although
the Iowa game was fairly well at-
tended. It is possible that this
has been due to the great number
of events that have occurred
since the holiday vacation. It 15
more probable, however, that the
popularity of basketball is on the
wane, and that its place as a de
partment of‘ Grinnell athletics is
not yet assured. At least there
seems to be a tendency in this
direction.

OW that the spring vacation

is at hand and students and
faculty are beginning to feel the
effects of the winter‘s work, it may
not be out of order to enter a pro
test against holding so many
social functions, lectures. recitals,
entertainments, etc., during the
winter term. A strong tendency
has developed during the last two
or three years tocrowd everything
of this kind into the months be-

tween New Years and Easter.
There are good reasonswhy some
of these should occur during this
time; why all of them, or nearly
all. should take place then is not
so clear. We acknowledge that
from the standpoint of the college
paper, it is very convenient to
have these different events COmC
at the time of year when the edi-
tor is the hardest pushed fornews,
but the disastrous results ale so
manifest that we are compelled
to enter a protest. The great
work of the students, the one
thing for which all are here, can-
not be done satisfactorily, when
so much attention is given to
things of minor importance.
When this fact is coupled with the
other significant fact, that the
time tor the much needed sleep
and rest, is being considerably
shortened, because of these numr
erous events, there seems to be
no good reason why a halt should
not be called. We ate surely
paying too much for our whistle.
