seeks to draw logical conclusions
from comparative scores. Years
gone by have seen greater teams

homage to no other team in the

produced brighter stars destined
to carry the tame of the l~lawkeye

The
one thing which now remains to
reduce all rcstilts to a complete
chaos is for Grtunell to defeat
Cornell and hence the state \\‘tde
itnierest in Saturday's game, But
the thing which arouses the
‘greatest enthusiasm among the
lsllpporters of the two teams is the
fact that in the history of Cornelle
lGiini-icll contests there has inc
variably been but one result and
that is that the purple has each
year been trailed the dust.
Many a time has the battle been
waged with exceeding valor on
both sides but when the conﬂict
cleared away the forces of the
scarlet and black have had undise
puted possession of the ﬁeld.
But this year promises to bring a
change unless the students rally
to the support of the team in such
,a manner as has not been seen
isince the days or the historic
Ames game in '97. To say that
things are in a desperate condie
tion for the home team is to put
the matter mildly. The Cornell
team. conﬁdent alter their Vice
tories over Antes and Drake, will
come with a crowd of rootcrs
ready to put up the game of their
livesto wipe out their past record.
But a bright outlook has never
preceded Grinnell victories. With
mediocre material and the bluest
of prospects her diminutive
elevens have hurled themselves
against overtowering opponents
with a spirit born of despair and
time and again hammered vic-
tory out of apparent defeat. Let
every one turn out Saturday after
noon and join in a genuine revival
of the old "Grinnell spirit" which
means yards of ground in victory
and a stubborn resistance in de
feat. We must win; we caniwe
will win if students, faculty and
town people join in giving the
pluckiest team Grinnell ever put
out its deserved support Saturday
aiternoon. Mass meeting in prep-
aration tor the game, Friday at

A Highly Interesting Lecture at the

"On the Trail of the Emigrant"
ivon for him the admiration of
hundreds of others, and hence
forward he is assured a wclconic
of the most cordial kind, The
impression made by or, Steiner's
forccful address can only be come
pared to that received lrnm lislcne
ing to the message of Jacob A.
Riis, a reference to whom, in the
lecture last night, met with siich a
sympathetic response,

Like Jacob A. Riis, Dr. Steiner
knows his Subject thoroughly, and
is ablc to express opinions and
give conclusions that are based
not only upon scientiﬁc study. but
also upon a wide personal crtr
perience. Thoroughly conversant
with the conditions of the poorer
classes in all the countries of
Europe, and knowing from actual
Contact in their homes, in the
workshops, and in the crowded
districts of the cities in which
they live, the hopes and sorrows
and the misery of the thousands
of ioreigners, who Come to this
country as a reiuge from perse~
cutions and unendurable industrial
and social conditions, Dr. Steiner
is in a position to clearly under-
stand their real needs and the
duty which the people of America
owe to them. His lecture last
evening was popular in the best
sense of the word,ithoroughly
enjoyableand highly instructive.
Dr. Steiner is a delightful enter
tainer, and held the closest ate
tention of his audience.

This evening at 6:45 in the
college chapel, Dr. Steiner will
givethe ﬁrst of a series of address
es, which will continue until Sun-
day. This is" an opportunity
which no student can afford to
miss. An early hour has been set
for these meetings so the hours
for study may not be interfered
with. This should enable all the
students to be present at each
meeting.
