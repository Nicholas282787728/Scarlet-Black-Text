HE debate of last Wednes-

day illustrates once again.

that Grinnell is sorely in need of
two very essential things, if to
our long list or deteats. n victory
is ever to be added. The debat-
ing team must get some support
trom the college, It is ridicul-
ously absurd to expect to build
up a succcsstnl debating system
on the efforts of only Six or eight
men, It simply cannot be done.
We care not how hard these men
may \vOIh. nor how diligent the
team may be in preparation, a
satisfactory system of debating
cannot be developed in this way.
There must be behind it enthur
Slasm on the part of the whole
institution. Tllcl'lzlrvuldsyslem.
which has been introduced this
year, is we belteve the best one
we can have, lint the Harvard
system at debating ivill3not per-

petuate itselt, any more than thc‘

Halvard system at football coach-
ing will perpetuate itself. This is

notaperpetualmotionatraii-,whicli
we may start going and which

will grind out annual victories, for
The system can accomplish
nothing unless the students and
faculty will do their part. This
part has not yet heen done. The
support given the team Wednes-
day night was wretchedly poor.
Out of respect for the past, it is
to be hoped that the term ”Grin»
nell spirit" will not be mentioned
in connection with the students'
part in the last debate. Further»
more, it we are to develop suc~
cesstul debaters, we must have
systematic instruction in the art
of public speaking. The power,
the effectiveness of a debater de
pends very greatly upon his,de-
livery. The truth of this was
brought home very clearly last
Wednesday evening. It is not
saying too much, we believe, to

us.

assert that it was Washburn’s
superiority in delivery that won
her the debate. Interior delivery
has played apromincnt part In
our former defeats as well. The
men who represented us in this
last cc-ntest have improved agrcat
deal in this respect during the
last year but they have been
greatly handicapped by the lack
of previous training. A good
public speaker is not developed
in a day. Where the necessary
funds are to come from IS a hard
question tor Grinncll, but the es-
tablishment of a chair in oratory
and public speaking seems to be
an absolute necessity for the de-
velopment or a satistactory ole-
batillgsystem.

SIMPSON TO-DAY

The baseball team left this
morning over the Rock Island for
lndianola, where Simpson and
Grillncll \l‘lll try conclusions on
the diamond. Because ot the
hard game of yesterday Clark
will not pitch, but will be substir
tuted by either King or Fillmore
It the team plays thesarne quality
of ball as that put up yesterday,
there can be no doubt thatanother
victory will be recorded for Grille
nell. Middleton, Simpson’s
crack pitcher, is out ot' the game
witha broken ﬁnger. This ma-
terially decreases Slmpson's
chances, Through the result of
this game a line on the strength of
Drake and Ames can be secured
since each of the above teams
have played Simpson and each
othert Grinnell’s team will be
composed of the following men:
Marsh. Flllmore, Schilling, Ben-
son, King, Clark, Fisk, Cole,
VVillet; Howard. sub.
