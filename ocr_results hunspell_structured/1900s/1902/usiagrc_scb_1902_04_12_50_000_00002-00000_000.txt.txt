BLACK printed an article
stating the facts with regard to the
tailure to arrange tor a dual meet
with S. U. I. and the cancellation
at the football game next fall with
the University. We took care to
say nothing that we could not sub-
stantiate from the correspondence
with Iowa's manager, in Com-
ment we quote from the Daily
Iowan ot April 4. the tollowing. in
which we presume sarcasm is in.
tended to be a substitute for facts:
“The blow has fallen. Our ten-
der affections have been rudely
triﬂed with and our onee kindly
accepted offers spurned with rulhr
less hand. Grinnell has refused
to play rootball with usaeoording
to promises made between Man-
ager Mecirtehen and Dickinson
last January, After so long and
pleasant a period ot mutual love
.and agreement. we are' told that
Grinnell has changed her mind,
that she must break her plighted
troth, that unless Iowa makes a
new agreement involving the
transportation ot her warriors ot
thegridiron toGrinncll,November
15, there will be no football more
between Iowa and Grinnell. Evel-
since 1898 the Iowa-Grinnell
games have been played on Iowa
ﬁeld, Grinnell has been accorded
the best dale she has asked and
from i898 to yestcr week all signs
and symbols showed that she ape
preciated very much the excellent
treatment accorded her, but with
the coming at the blithesome
springtide oflgo2, the plumed and
spurred game cock instead of the
dove of peace has ruled the roost
at Grinnell, Willingly would we
go to the ends of the earth at the
behest of the new men in the
athletic saddle at Grinnell, but
alackl our poverty forbids. The
receipts at Grinncll are small and
we must part.”

 

Last january at the meeting of
the baseball managers, Manager
Dickinson stated to Mr, Men
Cutchen that toi ﬁnancial ieasons
he was personally very willing to
have the football game go to Iowa
City, and that he thought such an
arrangement might be made, but
that, as MiaMcCutclieii well knew,
the whole matter would have to
be decided by Olll' Board of Cour
trol. Before the ﬁi‘stof February
Mr. McCtltchen wasiiiformed that
the game could not be played at
Iowa City, to which he replied on
February 473 fact at which the
[own/l was seemingly ignorant;
when exactly two months later,
on April 4, it gives utterance to
the “yester week"
quoted above. Equally accurate
is the [Mum/J statement of the
reason why the Iowa team could
notcometoGrinuelt. Their“p_o\Ir
erty iorhitls." Notonee. liowcvcr.
was the matter of their extreme
poverty mentioned in Manager
l‘i/lcCutclien's letters. On Febl'ur
ary 28th, a month before he knew
anything about il.according to the
1mm, Mi. Mecutehen gave his
reason tor not coming to Grinnell
iii the following sentence taken
from hisletter to Manager Diclt-

lnson: "We are away troin home
on the long trip to Ann Arbor,
Michigan, the week before your
dute,and then our only remaining
game after the one with you is
also played awlty irom home at
Clialnpaign. III,” This is the only
reason suggested at any time by
the Iowa manager. We would
suggest that the [aw/272’: sarcastic
fling would be more effective it it
squared to some extent with the
fact

expression,
