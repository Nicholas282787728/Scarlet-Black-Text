IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

 

CHRESTO-INSTITUTE DEBATE.

inter-society contest to be Held Dear
ember misubsidy ior Merchant
Marine lhe Bone bf Con-
iention.

The time of the interrsocicty
debate, which is held (luring the
fall term or each school year be.
tween the Chrestomathian and
Grinnell Institute societies, has
been set for December lath.

The question to be dcbaied is:
“Resolved, that the United States
should subsidize the Merchant
Marine." The aFﬁrmative side of
the question will be supported by
Messrs. Harry Dickinson, ’02; Ed
Dennison, ’03; Charles Barnard,
’04, and Paul Case, '02, as sub
stitute, of the Chrestomathran
society, while Henry Lyman, '02;
Geo. Arnold, ’03; Henry James.
'04, and L. D. Smith as substitute,
will argue the negative for Grinr
nell Institute. A glance at these
names will convince tlle students
that Iowa College has agood dc-
bating team this year in spite of
the discouraging defeats which
we have met at the hands of other
colleges during the last few years.
In giving their decisions against
us, judges, as a rule. have not
claimed that our men have pro
duced an inferior line of thinking.
on the contrary, we have always
been complimented for arguments
atlve ability.

But where we have lost the de
cisions liesm the failure to pre.
sentour argument as well as our
victorious opponents have pre
sented tlleirs. We have it from
good authority that one of the
judges, who voted against us in
the Washburant'lnnell debate at
Topeka, Kansas, last year, said:
IftheGrinnell boys had presented
the fad: in therr pattern” as well
as the Washhurn boys did theirs,
I would have voted for the boys
from Iowa.” This quotation
speaks tor itself.

It is believed that this difﬁculty
will have been obviated before the
WashburneGrinncll debate which
will occur here ncxtspring Miss

GYMNASIUM WORK FOR THE
YOUNG WOMEN BEGAN
MONDAY.

Tire gymnasium season is on
full swing and the college looker
on may see the young women
hurrying these cold days toward
the E. D. Rand gymnasium to
devote a proportionate amount of
their time in taking useful and
healthy gymnasium recreation,
which is so necessary when studies
demand such a large share of their
time.

There are two classes for be
ginners. one intermediate class
and aclass for young women who
have had two yearsin gymnasium
work. The systems used in the
classes are considered the best
and are admirably adapted for
supplying the needs or each in-
dividual girl. Free hand work and
light apparatus practice are the
principal teatures in the system
used, but military drill for women
and the Swedish system or gym»
nastics male upalarge part or
the work of the intermediate and
advanced classesr

There will be basket ball teams
for each class and the girls have
been practicing all fall. Much
rivalry is anticipated in the race
tor the basket ball championship
and the ﬁnal game of the schedule
will be played on the open day
which will be some time in the
latter part of the winter term.
