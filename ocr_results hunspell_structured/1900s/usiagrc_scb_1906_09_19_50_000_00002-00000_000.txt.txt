Qﬁbitorial

PTIMISM is a. beautiful virtue
and greatly to be desired, but.
we hate to see anyone have a. mono-
only on it. There are many who should
have a small share of the excessive
amount shown by the athletic editor
of the Ames “Student" when he Wrute
in his last issue that as for Griunell,
“well,100too will do for Grinnell.”
In spite of the oppressive magniﬁcence
01 the statement we have not thought
of Cancelling our game With Amos.

HETHER Or not class snraps are
desirable is an open question.
but taking for granted that at least
they area necessary evil, there are
Still one or two features which might
with good grace be eliminated.

Last year circumstances brought
about a coiillicb between the cored
members of the two classes Involved
in the scrap and the fact was deplored
by all who witnessed the hostilities.

We wish to call attention to our “10-
cal”depﬁrtmenb, where “lusts" and
“founds” are recorded. Itis our in-
caution to make this a sort of ex-
change wherein students may make
known their wants and ﬁnd where
they may be ﬁlled, at a nominal cost.
Articles of value are alten recovered
by this means which would otherwise
have been gone forever. Leave all
such notices in the SCARLET into
