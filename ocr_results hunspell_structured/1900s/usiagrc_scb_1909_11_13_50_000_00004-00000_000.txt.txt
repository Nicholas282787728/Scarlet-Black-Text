SCARLET AND BLACK

INTERVIEWER.

‘Why can’t we have a rifle club in
Griunell College?" This was the con.
clusion reachcd by a hunch of ielluws
who were discussing the matter one
day this week with the thot in
niilid that it might he possible, to do
something in the way or erl'ccting an
organ atioii among those who are iir
tcrc ed in “shooting irons." There is
a place for in s sort or thing in the
college mid it is not an organization
whrh Ileeil lntcirere with any other,
already e\i ting.

There, are n numucr oi Tellows about
school, not. ta g all active part in
any Inn“ at athletics, who would most
heartily welcome something or this
kind. A good many of the men in
school have rillcs and oiten go up the
railroad track or elsewhere at an at.
tel-noon to practice target shooting.
Why not start some sort or an arrange.
ment which would otter a little more
systematic practice in this line and
some interesting competition.

This is by no means an innovation
in the way of a college activity, There
are rilic cluhs at a great many colleges
and universities and these are tux-the
er united by a national association
which holds a meet each year. How.
ever, nothing so extensive could be ex-
necteil, and the idea is not to add an-
oihcr act up to the already large list
it is merely a suggestion {or System}
tlciug and making more interesting as
well as practical, a recreation already
much indiilsrd in by both faculty and
students.

“I think that it a course can he
handled with out a printed syaiiabus
it can't be worth very much," said a
department head the other day when
asked ills opinion on this point. "You
see there are so many courses that can-
not he put into a syllabus that will be
at all satisfactory. Some courses con.
tain a mass of facts that cannot be
well given in any other way. If you
are going to have a printed syllabus
which the student will never read ally-
how and then have time to discuss the
points included in, why not have a
text in the first place and not call it
a lecture course at all:l However, I
believe that in some cases a very
brici printed outline would be a very
good thing to give the student a rather
gencrnl idea. of the subject matter
which the course includes, But this
must be supplemented by a lot of in.
lorinarlon that can‘t be included in the
syllabus, but on which the student
might well talte notes."

“The seat sale arrangement Tor the
musical recital course Is the most inle
ed up chair that I ever got into," said
a Junior man Friday. “They let the
town people reserve their seats lor Llle
whole season and then the students
have to go and picl: out their seats
when the event occurs. You may get
Into a seat that. is reserved for some
of the town people and then at the
last moment when ihc'reeitai has coma
metlced, some one may come along
with a stub Tor your seat and you in. (e
to get up and leave it. I know they
put up ‘Icsel'ved thgs,’ but people
would come along anrl‘tear them down
and they are eilslly lost, anyway
I don’t see why they can't. take out
the seats that were reserved tor the
down town people {or the course and
then bring the rest up to the liln-ary

and let the students reserve them on"

their semester lee tickets,"
