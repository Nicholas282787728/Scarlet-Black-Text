Better Attendance Desired.

A word about the base-ball sit—
uation will be in order at this
time. The Grinnell team has not
been so Successful in the games,
as one might wish. It might be
that the team could have prevent-
ed these defeats, but it is absolute
ly unfair to place all the blame
upon the team. The support giv—
en by the students has been no
support at all. Only a few have
attended the games and those few
seemed utterly indifferent as to
the outcome.

At the Iowa-Grinnell game
there were not more than forty
paid tickets, and as aresult the
management is forty dollars in
debt. By far the largest part of
the audience occupied the side-
walks. the laboratory windows
and other convenient places, from
which the game could be watched
without the price of admission.

This condition of things should
continue no longer. At theArnes
game Saturday, there should he a
geodesized crowd present, who are
thereto help win the game, and
not to criticise the home, team.

 

"The Rivals" Progressing.

As has already been announced
inthese columns, “The Rivals"llas
been chosen by tho Scnior class
for presentation on Class Day.
MissSnlith haschosen the cast and
has been hearing rehearsals tor
the past two weeksor more. The
play as a whole was rehearsed last

next Friday night it will be given
before the play committee. The
cast is as follows:

Sir Anthony Absolute is a stub
born old man whodemands unhesr
itating obedience from his son in
the matter of accepting in mare
riage the lady whom he (Sir An-
thony) has chosen. Capt. Abso<
lute, his son, is an easy going
though quick witted fellow and
soon discovers that tlle young
lady in question is the very one he
himself desires. He seizesthe op
portunity to make a great show of
ﬁlial obedience, and in the mean-
time has much sport with the love-
sick Faulltland and the guileless
BobAcres. SirLuciusO'Trigger
is a ﬁery Irishman, also in love,
who proposes to see an awkward
situation settled forever by an ap-
peal to arms. Fog, David and
Thomas are old and trusted ser-
vants of Capt. Absolute,Acres,and
Sir Anthony respectively. Mrs.
Malaprop has a daughter, Lydia
Languish, whom she proposes to
dispose of in marriageto a certain
Ensign Beverly, which name Capt.
Absolute has assumed to disguise
his real army rank. To impress
her culture and good breeding up-
on tllose around her, Mrs. Mala-
prop slings big words, the means
ing ot which she can't even guess.
Julia is Constantly tortured by the
teasing caprice ot Faulkland,
Lucy is a most pert young waiting
maid. who gains considerable rev-
enue by carrying love messages,
which she never delivers.

The whole play is a high grade
comedy and is Sheridan’s ﬁrst. It

 

was written in I774. ﬁrst acled at
Covent Garden in [775, alld has
amused English audiences ever
since. Inl893theEllisandChres-
tomathian societies gave a very
successfulpresentation oithecom-
edy in Preston’s opera house. In
placing it upon the stage, the
Seniors have abundant opportunie
ty to bring out all the dramatic
abilityoftheclass. “The Rivals”
willbc played Monday night, June
[0, in the ladies’ gymnasinrn.

The Meet at Chicago.

On Saturday at Chicago the an.
nual meet of the Western Inter-
collegiate Amateur Athletic As-

the “big nine” are out of the as-
sociation, it still includes many
colleges with strong teams.
Among them are Notre Dame,
University of California, Leland
Stanford University, UniverSIty of
Missouri, University of Nebraska,
Yankton, (S.Dalt.) College, Carle-
ton (Minnesota) College, Drake
and Grinnell. Flrst place at the
meet will probably go to Notre
Dame while the other places are
doubtful. Grinnell has a chance
to win one of them. Drake and
South Dakota are also claimants
for the other places. Grinnell
will probably send the following
team:

Lyman

Conger

Crouch

Welker

Don Evans
Evan Evans
King
