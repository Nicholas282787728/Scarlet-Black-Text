PRESIDENT BRADLEY'S EASTERN
TRIP.

President Bradley has just re-
turned from an eastern trip ol
twenty days, Its ﬁrst went to
Washington where he was tht:
guest or Senator R ] Gamble.
and where he met the President
and otllcr distinguished statesmen,
and was entertained by Senator
Dolliver. From wa. lington,
President Bradley went to New
Voilr and was the guest or Dr
Albert Shaw in his beautiful home
at Hastings on the Hudson. and
was entertained by Professor
George M, VVhichcr, has
\TtElClC his mark in the New York
Normal College. A halt day was
spent at Princeton looking over
the chapel and Y. M. C. A. build-
ing. At Albany, he wasthe gucst
of Dr, and Mrs. D, O. Meats, by
whose charming hospitality there
assembled Professor and Mrs. H.
A. Davidson, Professor and Mrs,
O. Wr Holmes and Professor and
Mrsi I. F, Mather of Fort Edward,
a distinguished and enthusiastic
group of whom the college may
well be prond.

An hour was spent at Worcester
with the venerable patron ot the
college, Mr. E. A. Goodnow, who
bears his ninety and three years
as it they were were One~llllrd less.

Next came Boston and Salem,
where Dr. James L. Hill had made
ample provision. An address in
the Tabernacle Church, preaching
at Marbel Head, an address to the
Boston Ministers' Association,and
participation in the alumni bans
quet, were features of the visit.
Here an association was formed,
with Dr.Hill as President, and ].G.
Swan, Secretary and Treasurer.
The occasion was one of great on-
thuslasm and the college yell
made the old Bay State Capitol

\\ ho

ring.

Another day was spent in New
Britain and Hartrord, and halta
day at Mount Holyoke College.

 

after which President Bradley re~
turned to Chicago to participate

Treasurer, w. ]. Lindsay.
President Bradley returns pro
ftulndly grittelul for the kindness
and loyalty of the alumni and
more than ever appreciating the
great opportunity lying betorc the

college,

DR. STEINER IN THE OUTLOOK.

ln 7/2! Out/Mk for March 7, Dr.
Edward A Steiner has an article
on “The Slovak and the Pole in
America." Few men have made a
close study oi the Europeans who
come to America and few are bet
ter acquainted with the‘ condition
of the immigrant in his new home,
so Dr.Steiner's utterances on quess
tions of this kind are based on in-
timate knowledge of the taets as
they actually exist The Slovaks
and Poles associate much more
slowly with the rest otAmericans
than other Americans and only
about. six per cent of them remain
in America. They are patient,
industrious, honest and virtuous,
but have Iittleinitiative, invariably
drink alcllolic liquors and are given
to ﬁghting. Little has been done
to draw them out of their intelr
lcctual depths, tho at prescntefs
forts are beginning to he made in
that direction. There is room for
much effective work along these

lines, and the Slavs are bettcr
prepared tor advances than we are
apttothink.

Regular monthly choral service
to-rnorrow afternoon.
