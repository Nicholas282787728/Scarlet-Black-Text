AMES GAME.

Grinnell Loses Third Game at Season—
Students Must Support Team.
Better Than Ever.

Iowa State College won over
Iowa College at Ames last Satur-
day by tlte score 23-0. the same
score by which Grinnell defeated
Ames last year. The game was
squarely and clearly won by a
team which was super-iorinseveral
points, especially weight, The
one play which won the game tor
Arnes more than any other was
theguards back tandemtormation,
which seldom failed to work suc»
cesstully, and which seemed to go
through the Grinnell line, no mat-
ter how slow the start might have
been. The slowness of the Antes
backs was very noticeable, especi-
ally on end runs, This was the
weakest part oiAmes offense, and
when Ristine instills a little speed
into his back ﬁeld they will surely
be able to make a much better
showing.

Every man on the Grinncll team
played a good game. In speed
the team clearly excelled Ames,
but in punting was at a disadvanr
tage. Thegamewasanotherilluse
stration otthe advantage otweight,
a factor against which Grinnell has

had to contend in every game so
far this season.

In the ﬁrst half Ames made
seven points on a safety anda
touchdown. The ball had been
pushed to Grinnell’snveyard line,
when a punt was blocked and the
ballrolled outside,back otthe goal
line. The touchdown was made
by aseries oi short line smashes.
This was near the end of tlte half,
as no scoring had been done in
the ﬁrst twenty minutes.

In the second half the tandem
formation, which had been tried
and toundsuccessrul, was brought
into play and used effectively. No
gain oioverﬁiteen yardswasmade
at any time during the game in
regular scrimmages and even that
much was anvexception.

LECTURE COURSE TICKETS.

Tickets are on Sale and Should be Pur-
chased Earlye-rhe Course
is a Fine one.

The management of the lecture
course wishes to have it veryclearr
1y understood what changes have
been made in the arrangement of
the ticket sale, etc., this year.

In the ﬁrst place, there are no
second and third class tickets as
heretofore; in the second place.
no one will be entitled to a reserv~
ed seat unless he holds a course
ticket. We have been obliged to
holdthe course.witlt the exception
of one number, in the Colonial
Theatre, in which the ﬁrst ﬂoor and
balcony contain only ﬁve htln~
tired and thirtyrtwo seats. These
will be occupied only by holders
of Course Tickets it that manyare
sold, it more than that number
are sold the best gallery seats will
also be reserved. Those not pur-
chasing eourse tickets, will be
seated by ushers in the best un-
reserved seats available at the
time of their entrance. In view
of these facts our advice would be:
Buy course tickets, which may be
obtained from anyone ofthe {ole
lowing students:

Messrs.
Weber
Welker
McIlrath
DeHaan

Misses
A. Reed
K, Bailey

or at Rust's, Alley's, and Snidcr's
stores.

Remember the ﬁrst number is
next Wednesday night, and is one
you cannot afford to miss. Itabbi
Hirsch will speak on the library
question.

Number-drawing commences at
9:00 Saturday a. m. at Rust's and
continues till Monday 12 m. Seat
sale at the Colonial. Monday, 1:00
p. m. ti114:00. After that at Rtlst's.

Tickets are not selling as they
should. Tltis we attribute to the
fact that the Theatreisa new thing
and presumably students are “sav-
ing up” spare cashin order to take
in a few shows. It lies with you
to disprove this by patronizing an
established College Institution.

Price at Course Tickets $1.50.

Single numbers, 50 cents (unre-
served.)

It is more than probable that the
score this year will be much smalle

good article of football, and this
year they will have the advantage
or having good coaching. Our
last year's captain, Roy Fisk, is
coaching the Des Moines team.

While on the surface our team has

has been very much heavier and

The team will receive the support
of every student in every game.

HANDICAP MEET.

The meet willbe called prompts
ly at nine o’clock next Saturday
morning. Interest ln it has been
growing rapidly and manycntries
have come in since the list was

BLACK. Every event promises
to be close and the men are ex-
pecting to ﬁght for every point
A larger crowd is expected
than at any other tall meet ever
held and the spectators will no
doubt be well pleased with the
contests. At Arnes two weeks
ago good records were made in
the high jump, broad jump, pole
vault and low hurdles and Grin-
nell’s records in all except the
high jump should surpass these.

The events will be run off rapid~
ly and those who wish to see the
ﬁrst heats of the 100 yard dash,
