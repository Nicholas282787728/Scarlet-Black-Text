The basket ball season OI 19034, re-
cently closed, has been by far the
most satisfactory of any ill the history
of the sport in Iowa College. Its value
can not be measured in terms of suc-
cess alone: this year’s team has done
more than win victories for its alnla.
motel-fit has endeared the game to
the mass or the strident body as has no
previous team and raised it to the
standing it deservesﬁt distinctive
college sport quite as much as the
older established football, base ball.

crowded the Gym at the IViseonsin

which line the gridiron in autumn
The record of the tcanr is quite as
good as that of last year’s champion
aggregation, although this year Iowa
was fortunate enough to cinch the
pennant, Two thirds or our games
were won and during the season not a
decisive defeat was registered. Tile
season opened auspiciously with an
easy victory over the Des Monies Y.

The interest in lawn tennis which
till quite recently has run all too low
is ullmi‘ akably l'e\'ivirlg, and to rear
llze this, one had but to watch the
practice or the twenty or thirty en»

eagerness that Iowa College loolrs lor-
ward to the coming season.

Although it is too early for prophecy
it is safe to soy that our prospects are
bl',,ht,1'or with Belden and Blather--
wick still in the game the team will
be strong in doubles, more so than
last year, for each man has shown
marred development. For the third
place on the tearn there are many carr-
didates. Kenyon is back and will
show up well when practice begins in
earnest. Other men whose practice
has been worthy or mention aud who
