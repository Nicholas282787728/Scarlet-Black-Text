during the Christmas vacation.

The moderator oI yesterday’s meet
ing, after the psalni and hymn, called
on Professor Noble who gave a short
hisiory oi the movement, pointing out
that the idea is notnelvbuto ’ inated
in the student body about twelve
years ago and that it has since been
raised iour or live timesonly to be lost
in some other issue which seemed at
the time to be more important, Iie
then explained iully the plans ior '
mg money.

Mr, H. W. Spuulding was the next
speaker. He showed that from a pure-
ly business standpoint Griunell ought
to build the chapel in order to redeem
the promises made .years ago when the
money now on hand was raised.
Grinnell’s business reputation is at

stake. Also Grinnell is advertised
abroad as a Christian college and it is
necessary that she have equipment
sulhcient to sustain her record. ML
Spaulding: was followed by Mr. Jaipia,
Miss Hopkins, and MI. Menear, state
secretary oi the Y. M. c. A.
Secretary'r. 0. Douglass was next
called on and responded with a good
natured discussion oi what Grinnell
ought to do in this matter. He con.
sidered it bad policy to put up a
cheaper building than that ior which
the plans can and he expressed satis-
iactiou with the prospect oi mom»
complishing all that has been under-

taken. To do this, however, earnest-

' and not be done.”

BASKET BALL.

Preps iroi-n SenIm‘SAB Games
Ycr Corning.

As the class championship series
draws to a close, interest in the out-

come greatly increases. Up to the

present time the Men’s Gymnasium
has been the battle ground ior seven
of the most exciting exhibitions oi
class brisket ball ever seen in ci-iuncll

and the three remaining contests

promise to be thc beat or the series.
The two games played last Wednes-

day brought out a large and cnthusurs

ticciowd. The program was begun

with a twenty minute round between

the seniors and props. The senior-s

pi-nvcd no match [or their younger
brethren and quit the half with the
small end oi the score in their iavoc

When the next event or the alter-
noon was called and the soplis and
h-esliuien responded to the whistle oi
the reieree, alook or determination
was rivited on the race oi every
player. It was plainly acasc of“do
Tile hali was ex-
citing tliiougliout. the score being
slightly in favor of the soplis at the
end oi the twenty minutes.

The second lialioi the seniorrpi'ep
game was a reproduction oi the ﬁrst.
Both teams took a high hand in ioul.
ing. The brilliant work oi nelden and
Vulerius, at times, was the only iea—
ture and the game ended with ascore

The last hair or the sophomore-
ireshnien game proved to be the most

exciting exhibi on oiserics thus iar.
The ircshrnen had a slight advantage
in score during this hair but were
unable to overcome the loss oi the
diet hair and the game ended in iavor

The rooting during the aiternoon
was undoubtedly the best heard this
year. ,
