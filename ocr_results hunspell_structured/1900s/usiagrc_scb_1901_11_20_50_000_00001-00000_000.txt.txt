IOWA STATE CHAMPIONS.

Grinnell Loses in Hard Struggle, Iowa's
rHeavy Line Responsible, Capt. Fisk
Wins Admiration or Grinnell.

Another histor-i‘c battle has been
tought and another victory is add»
ed to Iowa's record. and one more
defeat endured by Grinncll. But
it was a victory which brought no
cause for selt congratulation and
a deieat which brought nothing
but honor, Never was there a
harder struggle between the old
rivals, never were attack and re
sistance ﬁercer and more deter
mined.

In spite of the coldness of tlie
afternoon.personal discomfort was
entirely ignored and the blood ot
the spectators went madly/pulsing
in response to the excitement of
the game. The wearers ot both
colors found so many occasions to
root that there was practically no
cessation io their demonstrations.

About a thousand people wits
nessed the game and fully a third
of the number supported the visir

trom Grinnell on the special train
in the morning. Upon arrival at
Iowa City it was at once evident
that victory was tar trom being a
certainty in the minds of the root-
ers there and their doubt was any.
thing but dissipated during the
progressotthe game.

A ﬁner exhibition of nerve.cool-
ness and steadiness under the most
trying circumstances imaginable
was never exhibited by a Griiinell
athlete than that given by Captain
Fisk in playing through the game.
Having been in bed [or the two
days prior to the game as the re
sult of serious injuries received in
practice, and putting on his uni~
form with the assistance of his
team~mates, in utter disregard of
the advice oi his physician, in ap.
parent deﬁance of all dictates of
reason, he played his position
without an error'and ran the team
with the steadiness and rare good
judgementsocharacteristic othim.
Every vioient movement caused
him the greatest pain, but he never
faltered or hung back and endured
all in silence, setting an example
for the team that was nothing
short of marvelous. If there ever
was a man to whom the student
body owes its sincerest homage or

IOWA 34, GRINNELL Ig-

Grinnell Basketball Team Shows up
well as a Team, but Iowa’s indi-
vidual Work Proves Superior.

Before a small but enthusiastic
audience, the scarlet and black of
Grinnell was lowered to the old
gold of Iowa by a score or 34 to
19, The game was extremely
fast for this time of the year.
Giinnell's score was due to hex
splendid team work, while Iowa’s
showing is to be credited to star
goal throwing.

During the ﬁrst half, Grinnell's
team play showed up well and en-
abled her to close the half with a
score of IO to 10.

In the second half. the Iowa
men improved in team work, play
ed taster, stayed closer to their
men, and threw more accurately,
while the Grinnell men were not
able to improve over the torm
shown in the ﬁrst half.

Ross was easily the star for
Iowa. while Captain McKeag
made the best showing tor the

DEMORALIZED EY DEFEAT.

7A Brace Must be Taken.

Grlnncll is usually free from
that bane of football success—
overcotiﬁdencer But the team this
year has been so successful and
especially made such a good show-
ing against Iowa Saturday that
they seem to think there is no
more to learn. The team in gen-
eral act as if the season were over
and they knew all about football
that is worth knowing.

is not absolutely proot against
slumping any more than any other
team. Drake is straining every
nerve to shut Grinnell out in the
Thanksgivinggarne. Drake looks
tor a hard game and ought to get
it. but if Grilinell does not keep
up her faitlilul work and avoid
overconﬁtlence,Diakc will win the
game, ior- her team is doing the
hardest kind of work.

SCRUB GAME SATURDAY.

Second Teams or lowa and Grinnell Play
at Iowa City SaturdayiA Hard,
close Game Expected.

It is with considetable interest
that the students will watch the
game next Saturday between the
Gl'iniiell and Iowa City second
tennis. Last week Iowa’s scrubs
played Coe College a tie, and the
crinnoll second team is playing
good hall. The greatest value of
the game, however, is in giving an
interest to playing on the scrubs,
Playing on the second team tor a
full season with tew or no games
is rather dull and when there are
games the interest of men who are
not on the ’Varsity is stimulated
and they are encouraged to stay
out and keep up their practice,
Next year's 'Varsity must take
much of its strength trom this
year’s scrubs, and the more inter-
est the scrubs have in their work
the better hall they ivtll play, so
these games count indirectly on
Grrnneil's showing nextyear, The

scrubs deseive a great deal of
credit this year for faithful work.
and will be entitled to all the
honor they can win by playing the
Iowa team a good game Saturday.
