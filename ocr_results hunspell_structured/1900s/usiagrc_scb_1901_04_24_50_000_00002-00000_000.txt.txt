®NE fault can be found with
our local meets. They are
run off too slowly. Sitting four
hours or so to watch struggling
athletic events is \vearisome.
Promptness would shorten the
meet and keep the spectator's irr-
terest undiminished. Thc fault
usuallyl.es with the athletes: at
the third call many of them are
not ready. If an iron clad rule
was laid down that an event would
be run immediately after the third
call, the athlctcs would be on
time, Spectators would like to
see this promptnessat the coming
class‘dual. ltrhehabitrvasformcd
then it might continue through
the season. The ofﬁcials in their
oFﬁcial capacity could do much
to bring about this habit,
ow that spring has ﬁnally
come, afact thatwill make
it necessary for many students to
pay their tribute to the latest
spring styles,——we wish to respect-
fully call your attention to our
advertisers. We do not claim
that our list includes all the good
merchants of the town, but we do
claim that those who help to make
this paper posslble by their-ad-
vertising, are men oftllc best burl

 

ness ability. and are perfectly re-

 

 

liable. They will glvl: you iai
treatment, and will make it u-orlli
your while to trdde with them.
Futhermore they deserve the
student’s patronage. By glance
rug through the columns of this
paper, it will readily be seen that
the nrerr who are asking lol'yolll'
trade, are the very men who have
helped to make the May Festival
an assured success; who have
rendered such efﬁcient aid to the
Athletic Union and other Dl‘géllll»
zutltms when in need of help and
who have so gcncronsly stood by
the students in undertakings at
different kinds.‘ To put it upon
no higher ground, rt is to the stllr
dent's selfrillterest to support the
men who have shown their friends
ship lor the college in so many
substantialways.

HE improvements that are
being made this year upon

the college campus are very gratis
fying. The new cinder lvallt il'o'hl
Blair Hall to the gymnasium, and
from thence to Wald ﬁeld. is oi
special importance This
was greatly needed and will not
only be of great convenience to
the students, but will add much to
the facilities fortrainrng, especial~
ly in the early spling, bctorc the
track at Ward ﬁeld isin condition.
For this purpose, however, the
walk is quite too narrow to givc
the best results. It is to be hoped
that it will be broadened soon, so

as to be better adapted to track
work.
