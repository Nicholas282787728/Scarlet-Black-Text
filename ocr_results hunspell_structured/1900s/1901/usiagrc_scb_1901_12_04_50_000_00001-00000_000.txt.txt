DRAKE DEFEATED AGAIN.

Grinnell Wins by a Score at 5 to 0—-
Clark's Punting the Feature
or the Game,

The game with Drake last
Thursday furnished another illus»
tration of the proverbial statement
that brains are superior to brawn.
It was a game between a light
team tllat depended on skill and
knowledge and a heavier and
stronger team tilat depended on
weight and muscle. The light
team wonifairly and deservedly.
Coach Best, of Drake, said imme
diately after the game that it had
been won by brains, and he was
right. It was brains on tlle part
of coach, trainer.captain and every
man on the team that gave
Grinnell tlle victory and made her
second among the teams of the
state. In all the ﬁne points of the
game Grinnell simply outclassed
her opponents; in mass plays,
alone, on which she depended al-
most entirely for her gains, was
Drake superior.

The most striking feature of the
game was Clark's remarkably ﬁne
punting. It was his game, and to
him is due, in large measure. the
victory for the scarlet alld black.
In all the games this season he
has shown good term. and clearly
had the better of his opponents in
the exchange of punts, but in no
other game was this so strikingly
manitcst as in the closing game,
The advantage gained tor Grinnell
in this way was greatly increased
by the exceedingly poor manner
in which the punts wete returned
by the Drake bucks. Ill this res-
pect tlle fat-famed Bacon is de-
serving of ﬁrst mention. I-Iis illa»
bility to handle Clark's spirals.
and the poor judgment which, ac-
cording to Drake men, he dis»
played in running the team are
apt to set one guessing as to what
is responsible for the reputation
which is borne by “the doughty
little quarter-back." as tlte Des
Moines papers are so fond of call-
ing him

Another feature of the game
which was equally important, was
the successful generalslnp of Cap.
tain Fisk. He has been a constant
surprise to‘ his friends and has
made a record which entitles hinl
to be classed among the best cap»

FIRST LECTURE.

Lorado Tart to Give First Number or the
Lecture Course at the Church
Tuesday Evening.

The opening number oi the Y.
M. C, A. lecture course will be
given in the Congregational
church, next Tuesday evening.
December to. and it promises to
be a number of more than ordin-
ary interest and value. There
are many who teel that the lan-
guage at art is to them unknown
and unknowable, but the lecture
of Tuesday will be free lrom dif-
ﬁcult technicalities and of genuine
popular interest.

Lorado Taft is himself a sculpr
tor of no mean abilityia skilled
member, in fact, of the craft to
which he belongs. He has mode
eled many busts of eminent men,
and statues and groups. The
bust ot Ex-PresLM'agoun in the
college library is his work. As
instructor in the Art Institute. of
Chicago, he has for many years
been a teacher of art to those who
are technically artists, and as a
public lecturer he has been in a
general way a teacher or arttothe
people.

In the last ﬁeld, as a popular
lecturer on art themes, he has
had a good degree or success.
His talks at the Columbian
Exposition were enjoyed by many
and slnce that time he has been
in nluch demand,

Mr. Tait has spoken on a large
number of subjects but the two
lectures which he is presenting
this season, one of which will be
given here, are entitled, “A
Glimpse of a Sculptor’s Studio,
or How Statues are Made." and
"Arnerlcan Painters and Sculptors
of Today," Both of these are
illustrated, the ﬁrst by tollowing
out on the stage the various steps
of modeling and the second by
the stereopticon.

The course this year is of such
a nature that the Christian Asso-
ciation may, without apology, call
upon the public for a better sup
port of it than was given last year.
Much depends upon the reception
giventheﬁrstnumberofthe course,
and it. is earnestly to be desired
that the patronage given between
now and Tuesday may be such as

to determine that Grinnell may
terminated on Fourth riot.)
