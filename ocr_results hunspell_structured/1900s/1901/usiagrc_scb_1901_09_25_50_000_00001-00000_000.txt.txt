CREDIT FOR DEEATES,

Report oi Special Committee Adopted
by the Faculty.

Those who were here last spring
will recall that the faculty. in re
sponse to repeated requests from
the students, through a special
committee made a thorough in
vestigalion of our system of rriterr
collegiate debating, with a View
to giving college credit for the
work in these debates. providing
this could be done without lower»
ing the standard of work required
in class-room. The result of this
investigation is found in the corn
mittee's report, which was edoptr
ed by the Iaculty just before the
close of school last year. The
recommendations of the Commit
tee are as foliows:

Ist. The committee recomr
mends that individual instructors
be expected to give credit for
work done in interrsociety and in~
tercollegiate debates, after the
debatezisgiven,providingthework
forms a logical partoia course
being taken at that time by the
debater.

2nd. Tile committee recom-
mends that the course in Argu-
mentation, offered by the English
department in the second semesr
ter. when taken regularly by de~
haters, be adapted as tar as is ex-
pedient to the needs of the debat-
ers in reference to their special
question (or the year,

Beiore adopting this report the
faculty carried on considerable
correspondence with other insti-
tutions regarding this question.
and it was tound that there was
much diversity of opinion and
practiceI and that whatever plan
should be adopted would be large
1y experimental. This action ot
the faculty was taken only after
serious consideration and an earn»
est effort to ascertain the best
plan which, under present condi-
tions. could be devised. Whether
the plan adopted will be success-
ful remains to be seen, but it is
the hope of all that it will prove
its efficiency by its beneﬁcial re
sults.

Those who made the extreme
demand that an intercollegiate
debate should be considered the
equivalent of a ﬁve hour course,
without any disctimillittiulr. will

 

no doubt be disappointed, but the
greatmajority otthc students who
recognize the very evnlerit tact
that college debating is not aca
denllc work, will ht: well satisﬁed,

with only a week's practice. The
lineup of old stars was tlle best
seen on the home gridiron in years
and they gave the 'Var-sity an
abundance ot opposition. The
crowd in attendance was quitesat-
isfactory from a Grim‘lell point of
Vle.

The game was called at 4
o’clock. The 'Varsity had the
north goal with the willd favoring
them. From the very start the
regulars played a kicking game,
Fisk always getting the punts off
well. The Alumni's great difﬁculr
ty waS'in handling the ball, The
passes were slow and after the ball
was passed it was often fumbled.
Two oi the touchdowns made by
the 'Varsity were very greatly as
sisted by this weakness of their
opponents.

Most of the gains were made
around the ends of the Alumni,
In covering ground, Moore was
particularly in evidence. having
one run of 30 yards around Alunr
ni right end to his credit, besides
several shorter ones. Dori Evans
circled the left end for 25 yards
and Fish also covered 30 yards
around the same end before he
was downed. Lyman was the
only ’Varsity man taken out on
account of injuries and his were
only slight.

The grads. covered their ground
through the line, but mztde no con-
sistent gains. The Alumni line-up
Was considerably changed as the
game progressed, and new men
were put in. but there was no let
up in their play.
