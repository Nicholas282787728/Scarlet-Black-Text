chillist. Religion is a matter of faith,
not of msthetics, and you cannot bring
ill the New Jerusalem by establishing
art museums, The fundamental chris-

God is in the world, arid to the Chris»

reality.

Communication from Herbert S.
Miller. S. of M.’93.

DEAR SCARLET AND BLACK: Re-
plying to the request to say something
in your columns about “music and
mrrsic study in Paris," it perhaps goes
without saying that a subject so come
prehensive must be treated most superr
ﬁcially ill so short an article as this,
even if the remarks are conﬁned to
the one branch known as vocal music.
Nearly every city of great size is
spoken of as “the Mecca” of some-
thing or other in these days, The
ﬁgure seems appropriate when applied
to the relation of Paris to the art stu-
dent, and especially so as regards those
making it study of singing. While
there are various recognized schoolsi
for advanced instruction in nrost of
the ﬁne arts, the vocal student of stelr‘,
lar aspirations to-dny must trrrn tow-l
aids Paris. This is the logical l‘esult‘
of the generous encouragement which
France gives to music arid the arts,-
vocal music being favored above tlle
other branches, as exempliﬁed by the
large subsidies contributed by the gov
ernment for the support of Theatre dc
l’Opera, Opera Comique (devoted to
lighter forms) and to the Conserva-
toire. By their contract with the gov-
ernment, the managers of the Theatre
de l’Opera and the Opera Comique
must give from four to six perform-
ances each week the year round, and
produce at least three new works
yearly, thus encouraging competition
in the ﬁeld of operatic composition.
Tile art of singing seems to be dead
in ltaly.

in Paris are to be found the only
legitimate successors of such old
masters as Lanrpel‘ti and Garciag
leading exponents of the old ltalian
school. Such names as Marchesi,
Sbriglin, Escalais and ViardoteGarcia
are fast acquiring the prestige formerr
ly enjoyed by those two great Italians.
In founding the Paris Conservatoire
the government has furnished an
institution where young people of
talent of all nations may obtain a
complete musical education pralically
free of charge. The names of the
leading masters of France are enrolled
in her facility.

But in addition to furnishing thc
illest instruction, Paris does much to-
Eward providing careers for those who
come to her in search of vocal distinc-
tion. At the Theatre de l’Opera the
lists are open to rill comers. Merit is
the sole requirement. An American
may secure an engagement at these
famous temples of music as easily as
a Frenchman provided he has attained
to the required high standard of vocal
proﬁciency. A stumblingrblock to all
foreigners is the French language.
One’s French must be pure to secure
the coveted contract. This has proved
an insurmountable barrier to many,
while a few, notably among the
Americans and Russians have success-
fully met the difiiculty. Brit cvcn
here the French government often ex»
lends a helping hand. A friend of

 

 

mine who was acceptable to the ex-

.the luost beautiful voices and the most

of our compatriots studying abroad
each year, the day when otir art
:schools will rank at the top is not far

urriining committee from a vocal
standpoint, but was found wanting in
the language, was placed trrrder all
able tutor of French diction and at the
expense of the government. He ex-
pects to make his debut at the Opera
Coniique during the coming month.
One often hears it srrid that nrorel
beautiful voices are to be heard now
at the Comiqrie than at the Grand
Opera. Such artists as Plancon,
Mllurel, Cnlve and Debra and our own
Snlldel'soll,’l'rncy and Whitehill made
their ﬁrst successes within its walls.

The corlditiolls that obtained at the
tirrle of the “Loliengrin riots.” when
the students of the Latin Quarter in
their hatred of anything German, ‘
massed at the Ed] Bullier and marched
in a howling nioh across the City to
the Theatre de l’Opera where the ﬁrst
performance of Wagner’s famous op-
era was being given, have entirely dis-
appeared. Now we have Wagner
regularly at the Opera. The best of
French orchestras—the Lanroureaux—
devotes whole programs to his com
positions, and the works of Massenet,
Saint Saéns rind Widor all betray the
influence of the great German. Thus
we see that the ,‘ancient enmity which
neither wars llor treaties could wipe
out may yet be dissipated through the
mystic power of music.

We, as Americans, may have a feel-
ing of justifiable pride in the general
concession that our fellow-country-
men are the best students, having also

talent of those heard in the Parisian
studios, These natural gifts coupled
with energy cannot fail to win for us
a high position ill the future, Arid to
digress a little, the same is true of
painting and sculpture, Avisit to the
two Paris salons now open, wherc the
exhibits of American artists are ex
ceeded in number and general excele
lence only by the French, is eloquent
of out high standing ilr these sister
professions.

Art is broader than any country.
Brit it is pleasant to think that
through the influence ofthethousal isi

removed and when these pilgrilnages
to distant lands in search of the iligh'
est and best \leI be unnecessary. To-
day Paris is an ideal place for the
study of art in every form. It per-
vades the city to the farthermost nook
and corner and it may be said than
here is heard the world’s music.
Sincerely yours, ‘
HERBERT S. MILLER.
