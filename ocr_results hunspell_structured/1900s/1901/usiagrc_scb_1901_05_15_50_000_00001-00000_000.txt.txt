The May Festival.
MONDAY mom‘s cosccur.

The ﬁratof the May musical festival
concsrts was given Monday night before
a brilliant audience that ﬁlled the Con-
gregational church, and who manifested
a ssnsitivs responsiveness to the work
of the artists. The orchestral part was
the most prominent in the avaniug’s
program and was of a character to linger
in the listener's mind like the memory
of a delightful drsam. An English
writsr on music has said that the leader
is a soloist, also, and that the orchestra
is his instruinsnt, and should express
his conception or the composer’s work.
This is certainly true of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra. It is I] composite
instrument. The quality of the tone it
gives forth ia the purest, swsotest and
smoothost imaginable, In ensambla
and the grouped eﬂ’scts we could hear
no blemish, and in so perfect an organi-
Aation it was a surprise to note fora few
measures in the opening number an ap-
prsciable dinsrenos in therhythmol the
muslo‘ and the boat of tha bliton. The
“instrument" was parceptibly aloiv

ture which was the ﬁrst number un the
program,haa held a leading place in the
musical world for thrssrquarters of a
century and shows no sign or pulling on
tho puhlic appetite. Dr Spitta of Her-
lin, writing within a score or years, says
that in originality Webs: has not boon
surpassed by any musician, ancient or
modarn. The slsmentol the marvellous,
the uncanny, and a counteracting simr
pie yet strong religious tone. and the
"taking" character of the airs, perhaps
explain ths longevity of the opera. Ths
overture, following the mode of operatic
construction of that time, presents the
urine or the themes or the opera in a com-
prehensive form. It prepares the nu-
diencs for what is coming on the stage
musical, but it does not tall the story of
the play. Two honest lovers, Agatha
and May, rind a jealous rival, Caspar. a
pious hermit, and the prince or darknass
furnish the movement or the drains;
Caspar conspiring with the evil one to
destroy the pars, pious heroine, becomes
the victimnf Ills own pli)t,ilnd virtue and
vice are both rewarded. True melody,
dramatic force and weird orchestral
arrests characterize the work, and it
has furnished to hymnology two of its
most beautiful themes. The beauty
and sweetness o! the melodies lost
nothing in the hands of this bond of

 

artists, and Mr, Roasnbscker shows lllmv
salt a leader of tho ﬁrst ordsr. A rap-
atitlon was demanded and an odd com-
position by Erich, “Tho Stapmoihsr,"
with astrlcking effect by piccolu rind
rlute, was given.

The second number was the slnlusntly
poetic song from Wagner's Tmmltilusci',
“0 thou sublime, sweet evening star,"
and wassaog by Mr. Charles w.CIarlr.

The rich background of orchestration
peculiar to Wagner was most marked in
this nuinhsr. Mr. Clark responded to
the enthusiastic applause with “Dio
nosssnte from Gounud'a Faust.

The nnnnisasd eighth symphony in E
minor of Franz Schubert, in the third
numher, permitted the orchestra to show
its right to the title of a symphony or-
ohsatra. Thisinnomplatslvorkwnslound

So prolinn was Schubert in musical come

particular days he wrote ﬁfteen songs.

or poetry that came into his hands, and
one writer says that had he livsd ha
would have set the whole mass of Gor-
uiiin literature to music. This inter-
rupted work. broken off after two move-
ments at the ninth msnsura of a scherzo,
is beautifully mslorlious, and has fur.

gls instruments The orchestra was at
its best in this, ’pivinu tho lnalndious
opening ullsgro with the utmost swsntr
ness, and the andants with great delicacy.

The"Solnning Chorus" from Wagnsr's
Flying Dutchman was givsn by a ladies’
chorus from tho Grinneli Oratorio sooir
ety, with orchestral accompaniment,
Prof. Cole lending. The effect showed
much good training on the part or the
alnaars who wore warmly applauded.

Ths“Ridoof the Valkyries” [rom Wag~
ner's great work, the Nioslung myths,
was given by the orchestra to close pert
one of the program. The Valkyries were
amazous riding serial stssds, passing over
battleﬁelds to gather the souls of the
slain and hear them to Valhalla. They
seemed to take a grswsoms delight in the
occupation rnr they laughed and called
to each other during their ruin. Wag.
not alone could write music to express
so wild a conception. Swirt runs or od.
dly combined instruments give the im.
pression or beings madly rushing thru
the air, while the dates and piccolaa
break in with shrill. laughtarrlika notes.
Apparently iill rules or musical enact are
set at deﬁance and the players have to
go by “dead reckoning.” so to speak.
only consummate skill can adequately
rsnllsr such scenss. Hare Mr. Rossnr
backer showed himself a master of his
art. The work was given with thrilling

applause.

pupil of Goltermuu. This was aohangs
of selection but not of the composer.

 

Popper attained to tha conceded ﬁrst nor
sitlon as a ‘csllo soloist about the '60s.
Mr. Franz Wagner gave the program
number in which there is graceful inslor
dy and brilliant eﬂscis with rare skill.
The accompaniment was by the string
and wood wind. An enthusiastic our

In the next numhsr Mr. Holmns anr

beautiful “Cujus Aulml" from the
culebratsd Stabatt Illatcl' of Rossini.
This composer wrote some of the most
beautiful masses in musical resources of
tho Calholin church. Mr. Cowper has a
clear tenor voice or much power, with
high chest note of great purity. The
(inn melody orthe composition was beau.
tifully given, while the wide intervals in
the opening passages were taken with
arise and accuracy. Hearty applause
was rendered but Mr. Cowper simply ac-
knowledgsd it.

The eighth number was the Violin

delssohn, played by Mr. Herbert Butler
with rlira skill. The Work consists of an

In the ninth number a change from

he is said to have sxprsssed this ﬁne po-

were quick hurats ol applause, marking
earnest attention and discrimination.

strongly distinguishing characteristic of
Wagnerian composition is that to every
prominent character, action or emotion.

out in the music at the approach or pres-

prelude to “Lohangrin.”lor this is not in

to the soft and delicats chords of the
opening. It is a grand though simple
eﬁsct, which shows that Wagner could
produce the utmost hsauty and delicacy

Mr. Towns, of whom pleasant malnor-
ins of a former visit to Grrinnall remain,
had the second numuar, singing a hsuur
tiful irBDOl’ aria from “La Giacondai" by
Ponchislli. Mr.’l‘uwne’s sweet and sym-
pathstlc voice was well suited to the
melodious air, which was well received.

It is said of some players that they make
