of both faculty and stue
dents to the notice which appear-
ed in ollr last issue to the effect
that all notices should be in the
hands of the managing editor not
later than nine o’clock on the day

made necessary because oi our

HE announcement in anoth-
er column in regard to the
course in expression and oratory,
offered by Miss Glenna Smith, is
asource of great satisfaction to
SCARLET AND BLACK, as it is, in
deed, to all who have the debate
ing and oratorical interests of the
college at heart. The need of in-
struction these subjects has
been very great, and considerable
discussion of the question has lak-
en place among the students dur-
ing the past ten years. It has
been very evident that something
was needed to give our college a
better standing in debating and
oratory. We have been unwilling
to admit that our representatives
were inferior, mentally, to those
of other institutions, and we have
been just as unwilling to believe
that they failed through lack of
preparation. The only other ale
ternative is that they needed
careful instruction and training.
Whether this View is correct, or
not, remains to be proven, We
believe that it is, and that the re
sults of lulure contests will subs
stantiate it. It should be borne
in mind, however, that this dc-
parttnentislargely an experiment,
and its future growth depends
upon the present support it re
ceives from the students.

Society Work.

The activity of the members of
the literary societies among the
new students has aroused an unusr
ual interest in society work lot the
begill'ning of the tall term, Work
has begun with vigor and the
members of the different societies
look forward to a most successful
year. The lnstiiutesocicty holds
its meetings every Wednesday ev-
ening of the school year, the Cal-
ocagathian and Ellis societies (or
young women every Friday after
noon, and the Chrestotnathiau so»
ciety every Saturday evening. The
new students are invited to join
one of these societies in their
Freshman year and not put it off
until some later time in their
course, thereby losing a most prao
tical and valuable training in de-
bate, oratory and original literary
productions which this branch of
college life attords.
