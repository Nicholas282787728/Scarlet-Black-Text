BRIEF comparison of the
enrollment itt the college
this year ulth that of last year
will set at rest the mttids of those
wire, through laclt oi information,
are inclined to assert that Sumac
thing must be wrong with tile coir
lege because, as they state, the
enrollment is smaller than it was
last year, while attendance at oth
er institutions in the state is con
starrtly increasing. In order to
avoid any charge of untairnessthe
comparison will be tirade between
the attendance as secured yCSlek
day at the president's ofﬁce, and
the enrollment as given in the di-
rectory or last year, whiclt was
published about November lst.
The ﬁgures in parallel columns
are as follows:

last year is due wholly to the de-
crease in the number of Acadeniyl
students. One very signiﬁcant
tact,which is not shown by the la-
hie. will explain satisfactorily how
rt is that the present Freshman
class is smaller than the Fresh—
inaii class or last year. Under
the registration rules of last year
anyone who had done the prepar-
atory war]: and hatl twenty-four
hours of college credit could reg
ister as a sophomore. According
to the rules governing the ngIS'
tration for this year. anyone who
had twetity hours college credit
was registered as a sophomore

riiis change was made simply tor
the purpose ot cqualizingto some
extent the work of registration.
but as a result of it at least thirty
who, under last year's
quirernelils would be ircshrnen,
are now classiﬁed as sophomores,
If the old rule had continued the
Freshmen today would number a
hunched and forty as against a
hundred and nineteen last year.
while the sophomore classes of

tar

the two years would be the same

With this showing and Wlli] this
great infusion of new blood into
our college hie, there is no ocea-

sion for discouragement or alarm,
