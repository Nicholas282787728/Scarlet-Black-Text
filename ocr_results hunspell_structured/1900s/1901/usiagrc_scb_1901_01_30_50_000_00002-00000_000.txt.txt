progress in the realm of science.
The college or today rs throwing
off the traditional usages which
have so seriously llalnpeled it in
the past, and is beginning to adopt
more liberal principles. About a
year ago the ﬁnal semester exams
inations were discontinued and a
netv system inaugurated iii Grinr
nell. A higher grade of class.
room work was to be required and
occasional “drop” examinations
were to be ‘given. The result has
exceededthetttmoste‘oectt-ttioiis.
Under the old last
week of each semester was taken
up with examinations oi from one
to three hours in length. The ner-
vous strain o[ this week of tenor

ceded by several weeks of citcr~
vating “Clammtng.” Asa psycho-
logical fact. it is well established
that this "cramming,” or the in
tense application immediately
preceding ﬁnal examinations, not
only accomplishes no permanent
results but is even injurious. Rec

association so the material
which i.- pained Llll‘t ugh study day

“dtnp” examination precludes the
possibility oi this harnttttl ”Cl'itm»
and also forms an added
incentive for a more thorough
daily preparation. A Comprelleltr
si't'e review at the end of the scmr
ester is far more beneﬁcial as a
resume of the course than any pl'c-
lrrninary “cramming”or single .

amination eotlld he. Under this
system also the classroom work
naturally becomes more important
and increased requirements in this
direction point to a higher stand
ard or seitolarship. 0n the whole
the system is a rational and Sara
viceable one, and atter a year’s
trial we can safely say that it has
proved of great practical value.
Tire person is hard to ﬁnd either-
among the faculty or students
who, having experienced the tor-
midable effects of the old system,
would desire to return to it now.

Pres lent Ayeis, of the Univer-

about radical rcjorms. He has

From the advance sheets of the

received at the University, it is
learned that Minnesota stands
