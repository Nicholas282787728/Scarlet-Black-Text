Academy Commencement
Exercises.

The second number of tile come
mencement week programme has
been carried out and no one can
hope for more than that that
which remains to be given may
be as successtully rendered. A
good audience greeted the class
of i905 at the stone church yes~
terday and heard the Academy
anniversary exercises and it any~
one there had questioned whether
the Senior Preps were as good a
class as they were said to be his
doubts were gone at the close ot
the programme. Theclassisnow
at liberty to enjoy the rest of the
commencement exercises without
any worry as to how its own part
shall be played. They may look
with satisfaction upon the way it
was given.

The platform. tastily adorned
with Grinnell’s best house plants,
was occupied by the entire Acadr
emy faculty. Each speaker en-
tered from the rear and took his
place in the audience immediate-
ly after his performance.

Promptly at 2:30 the program
was opened with an invocation by
Prof. Parker, after which Miss
Ethel Sedwick recited an entire
chapter from Les Miserables in a
manner that did Victor Hugo full
justice. The next number was an
original poem‘by Geo. F. Richard-
son and it’ was deservedly well re~
ceived. Then followed aselection
and encore by the Euterpe club.
The fourth speaker was Fred F.
Buck who delivered an effective
oration on the American race
question. Mr. Buck was the rep-
resentative of the Lewis Literary
Society and it may well be said
that he did his society honor. A
brief and appropriate paper was
read next by Miss Lois Bradt on
the class of 1905, its past and its
future. and/the ﬁrst half of the
program was concluded by the
Chaminade Quartet.

The second half consisted of a
scene from Minna von Barnhelm
by three from Miss Henderson's
class in ﬁrst year German, an

original poem by Glen Clark, a
recitation by Miss Fay Cline and
music by a violin quartet consist-
of Miss Crowell and Messrs. Tem-
pleton. f’arks and Noble. At the
close of the programme each
student received his certiﬁcate
entitling him to college classiﬁca
tion. At four o'clock all was
over and those concerned were as-
sured that everything had con-
spired to make the exercises all
that could be wished.

Hatchet: Burledr

Last evening the annual cere-
lnony of reconciliation between
the Senior and Junior classes took
place upon the campus. Dressed
as Indians the tribe of 1901 as
sembled upon the south campus
while the tribe of 1902 met among
the trees upon the north campus.
After some preliminary signaling
and answering signals with sky
rockets and Roman candles the
two tribes advanced toward each
other with ﬂaming torches until
there was but a wide open space
between them. Here the tribes
stopped for a pow wow, illumined
by red and green lights while
three scouts from each tribe met
in the center to arrange a meet-
ing. The tribes then led by the
respective chiefs upon ponies
marched indian ﬁle around the
campus making the air ring with
their yells, and ﬁnally meeting
around the peace ﬁre upon the
east campus. Here speeches
were made by the two chiefs re-
counting the tour years’ strife
now about to be ended, and words
of farewell to the tribe ofxgol
about to depart tor other hunting
grounds. The hatchet was being
buried when a shot washeard and
two indian scouts reported a white
man's moving wagon approach-
ing. Braves were sent out and
aftera skirmish the wagon was
captured, brought to the ﬁre and
on being looted was found to con—
tain refreshments, doughnuts and
ﬁre water (lemonade). This feast
ofgood will ended the pleasant
ceremony marred only by the fact
that some prep thinking to play
a smart trick had stolen the bowl
from the pipe of peace and thus
caused this cerenlony to be dis
pensed with.
