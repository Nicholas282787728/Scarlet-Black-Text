Q‘Bbitutiul

E purposely retrained troni
saying anything editorially

in our last issue concerning the
brutal and unwarranted assault
upon Reteree Lane at the close of
the Drake game a tvcek ago. We
thought it wise. since Grlniiell Was
a pa'rtlcipant in the game, to deter
any comment until the facls had
been more thoroughly investigat-
ed, and until Drake had had an
opportunity to take whatever ac-
tibn she deemed advisable. Else-
where in this issue are to be found
the resolutions with reference to
this assault adopted by Drake's
athletic board. We are glad that
the athletic authorities have thus
ofﬁcially proclaimed their (lisapr
proval ot this disgracerul act, But
we are inclined to believe that the
onense is greater than is indicatcd
by the tone of these tesolulions.
The attack upon Referee Lane,
although directcd agamst him
alone, was in fact an attack upon
college athletics. Ittvasunspoits-
manlike in the extreme, and en-
tirely foreign to the spirit which
should govern contests of this
kind. As is proven by many who
witne d the incident, the assault
was made by a DK'JlkC Sludenti
identiﬁed by some as Gt'acscr, ale
though Llenletl by llimrrand, what

is at much more signiﬁcance, was

upheld by a mob of fellowstur
dents. Cl'uwdcd about the
prostrate ofﬁcial with the purpose
of doing hiin runner injury, and
who undoubletjlt would have ace
coinplishcd their purpose had it
not been for the presence ot the
police. The spirit which animated
these students is to be deplored

who

more than the assault itself. And
it is at this point, we believe. that
the resolutions of the Drake atlir
lelic board [all short, In our opinr
ion they should do more than
simply resolve that they deplore
the fact that an assault was made.
They should do more than Simply
promise to do all in their power
to prevent a similar occurciice,
For the sake of intercollegiate
athletics, and lor the sake ol their
own institution, the Drake author-
ities should ﬁnd out the guilty stu
dent, and administer a punishment
commensurate with his offense.
In addition to this,they should see
to it that the students ln their in-
stitution understand, better than
they ever have beture, the spiri|
winch is supposed to dominate
college athletics This assault
upon an ofﬁcial is but the result
at harboring a spirit which perr
mils underlianded and unfair pldy~
ing intercollegiate contests.
The outcome of this will be EHVRIK'
ed anxiously by all the institutions
which have athletic relations with
brake, and her standing among
the colleges of the west will :15
pend much upon the attitude she

in

now assumes.
