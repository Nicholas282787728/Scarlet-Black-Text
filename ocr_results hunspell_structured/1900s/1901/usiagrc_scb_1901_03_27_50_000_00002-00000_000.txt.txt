Grinnell, Wednesday, March a7, :90}.
AT has been lound inexpedient

to issue the SCARLET AND
BLACK on Wednesday when that
day is the lztst of the term. So
many students leave town betore
the paper is out that the ef-Eorts
of the staff are practically wasted.
Therefore. there will be but one
more issue before the vacation.
Ordinarily this would come on
Saturday, but so many events
take place that dayr-concerning
which many students would like
to be informed, that the paper-
will be held until the following
Monday. By this arrangement
no current news will be omitted

and the nuneappearance or the
paper on the last day oi school

will be unnoticed.
ZEHE southern part of the
campus has lately been
disﬁgured by the erection of two
electric light poles near the cin
der path. For the past ten years
the lines have been run south to
theroad and,practicallyconcealed
by trees, were not conspicuous.
But this recent change, evidently
made to save a few lotls of wire,
stands out boldly. The present
beauty or the campus has only
come through years of slow

 

growthand cultivation. It should

 

be preserved against what might
be called protane intrusion. In a
town overrun wlth telephone, tclr
egraph and electric light poles
and wires there should be one spot
tree and inviolate. The Iowa
Central R. R. passing through
the campus and disturbing chapel
exercises is bad, but can't be
helped. This matter of electric
light poles can be helped. They
should he removed at once. It
this is not clone voluntarily, the
Trustees may very properly use
compulsion.

FFICIENT as the present

service ot the library rs.
we believe there is one thing
which, if added, would greatly e",
hance the value ot the equipment.
One of the two requirements of
the public library at Birmingham,
England, is that the user of books
must have CL AN HANDS” We
might perhaps adopt this rule as
a good one tor our library were
it not for the fact that there would
be no immediate means of cbln~
plying with tllls requirement even
in the direst extremity. The stu»
dent who has been attendinglectr
ures and recitations and knows
the adllcsivenessotdustantlchnllt;
the student who comes in from
the ﬁeld or cinder path; and even
the student who has been delving
among the dusty books and papers

and probably many more would
be only too glad to indulge in a
cool ablulion. A lavratory cnn~

this,the direct saving in the up
