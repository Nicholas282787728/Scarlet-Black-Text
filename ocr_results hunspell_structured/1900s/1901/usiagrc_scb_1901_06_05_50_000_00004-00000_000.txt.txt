The meet on the WholC was un-
satisfactory. Fewer than hall the
colleges of the association were
represented, the track was a
wretched one and good records on
it were absolutely impossible.
Gr-innell's team of slx men put up
a game struggle tor a place. In
the hall mile run only three men
were able to ﬁnish on the’lrcavy
track, on accountoi the last pace.
In the quarter, Lyman made the
gamest ﬁnish oi the day to win a
place. In the high hurdles Bail'
lost by four inches. Although
the meet was not what was ex-
pected, the team gained a great
deal ot experience and won
enough points to make the trip
worth while.
