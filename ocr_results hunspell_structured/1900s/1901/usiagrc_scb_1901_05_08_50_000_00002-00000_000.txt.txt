unmentioned. The management
did something never done betore:
namely, Fired tlle grin iorihe hun-

the meet was scheduled to begin.
and broughtthe atternoon's per-
iormance to a close in the neigh-
borhood ofﬁve o'clock. Nobody
got so thoroughly tired as in pre-
vious years. The management
has proved that energy on their
part can ci-owtla meet into the

this proof is impressed upon next

Brief Review of Y. M, C. A. Work
of Year.

The prevalence in the college
community of a broatl Christian
sympathy marks the close or the
Association year and even the case
llzll observer will notice the feeling
otuniiy and harmony in the Chris—
tian work. It is the purpose of
tllisﬂltlcle to give a briefsummary
of the work,

Among the lincl: of work pur-

and in place oi classiﬁcation by
members of the faculty, each do-
ing such work as he thought best.
student leaders have been silbstl-
tuted and a systematic course of
study outlined by the Internation-
al Committee of the Young Men's
Christian Association. That this
change has been beneﬁcial
shown by the manifest interest in
the classes and their steady at-
tendance.

Much interest has been display-
ed ill missions and a class in
sion study has been successrully
working throughout the year.

While the attendance at the res
ligious meetings hasnotbeeillai-ge.
the meetings have been very tillers
esling and helpiul. The members
ot'the faculty have clone much to
help and gratelul appreciationis
expressed for their efforts.

Oi the ﬁnances of the associas
lion little can be said. Alter'a
thorough canvas of the students
the association is compelled to
close its Wotk with a debt.

The association has tried to meet
the demand for a unirying element

in tire social lire ot‘the college but
has done little toward this end be-
cause of the lack of proper facil-
ities. For this purpose the asso
ciation should have a home.

in general. the work of theas.
satiation has not been what was
expected and the year is closed
hoping that another year, by the
united efforts of the men of the
institution, will close with the work
where it should be.
