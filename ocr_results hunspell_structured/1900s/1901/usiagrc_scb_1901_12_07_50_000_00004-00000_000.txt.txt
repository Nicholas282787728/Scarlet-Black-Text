THE CONFERENCE MEET.

A meeting ot the Conference
Asssoclaiion. in other words the
"big ninc" colleges, took place
directly following Thanksgiving
Day at the Victoria Hotel, Cllr
cago. Many ofthe football, track
and base ball stars, coaches and
all the athletic managers of these
institutions were present.

The meeting was of special
signiﬁcance tor these nine schools
in that their relations seemed to
be brought into,ctossr harmony.
Nor was the meeting devoid of
signiﬁcant enactments leading to
a purer state in western college

 

athletics, It was decided that
[or any mail to play sentiepro-
I onal or professional base ball
games, or in games where prizes,
premiums orgate money is after
ed would render him ineligible in
amateur athletics. This clause is
greatly needed the athletic
compacts of all western schools.

Another signiﬁcantiulingis the
Conference interpretation of the
“fouryear” rule to apply to tour
years in the aggregate for parti-
cipation in college athletics, and
not four years on any one team,
in any one institution. All sum-
mer tooibalt training is discourag
ed by a rule prohibiting the call-
ing together of a team before two
weeks prior to the fall opening of
the institution.

SENIOR EoYs' SMOKER.

The senior boys. not to be out-
done by the young ladies of the
class, who assembled some two
weeks ago tor a quiet sewing bee.
regaled themselves at the home of
Mr.chry Lyman last night with a
quiet snicker. It was evinced that
the young men of the class had
not been completely patchedeup
upon their surprise of the Senior
Girls' Club at its ﬁrst meeting, as
every man had his sewing and
knitting along The evening had
not advanced very far before the
somewhat anticipated appearance
of the senior girls took place.
Each girl brought along smoking
utensils, which, however, showed
an astonishing lack of usage. From
that time on it would be diﬁ‘icult
to tell who ate the most candy
cigars, described the best circles,
or got the dizziest. No one, how»

ever. seemed to. feel seriously the
effect of the evening‘s entertains
merit. The lack or smoke, so gen.
erally prevalent upon such occas-
ions. was the most striking feature
of this ﬁrst meeting of the Senior
Boys’ Smoker.
