THE TEAM THAT thL MEET

DRAKE.

As the day for our last game

on the ﬁnishing touches. prepara-
tory to ending the season ivith a
good, strong showing. The team
IS not a perfect one by any means.
and can always gain something

Ttatt expects to keep the men at
work, improving in team work and
perfecting plays till the last mine

program every night till Thanks

THE THANKSGIVING GAMES.

With the close of the season the
eastern championship is without
doubt given to Harvard by her
defeat o[ Yale Saturday. In [Its
middle west hoth Michigan and
\Visconsin ltave claims on the
championship. neither having
been defeated this year, biitex-
peits generally give the sham»
pionship to the Wolverines. But
while the championship is settled
in the west as deﬁnitely as it will
he this year there arc several
Thanksgiving games that will he
of interest to western football
thusiasts. Michigan and Iowa
will play at Chicago where the
only question will he the size of
Michigan’s score, though Iowa ex-
pects to play a plucky game.
Minnesota and Illinois will play a
game that will vcry likcly he
closer than expected unless the
gopliers have a heavy ﬁeld on
which to use their weight. Both
have played Northwestern and
the scores favor Minnesota, but
the lllinois-Northwestern game
was early in the season. herore Il~
linois struck hei gait and Min.
nesota dcteated Northwestern
Saturday in aliard tought game
on a heavy ﬁeld. In the Wiscolr
sin»Chicago game the question is
again Only the size of the score.

In Iowa interest centeis in the
Drake-Grinncll and the Antes—
Simpson games. The tormer is
Very much in doubt with the odds
in favor ot Drake on a heavy
ﬁeld. The Ames-Simpson game
will be hard fought and will prob
ably he won by the latter by a
small score. Simpson has played
consistent ball all this season ex
cept in the Grinnell game. where
she did not put up her best game,
while Amos though not so con-
sistent as she should have been,
has shown lterselfcapable of play
ing a good hard game.
