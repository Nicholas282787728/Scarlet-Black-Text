action was taken which is of the
greatest interest to Griiinell peo-
ple. Our former president, Dr
George A. Gates, wastheri. unan»
imously elected president of that
institutionmto succeed Dr, G. M.
Herrick who resigned last June

A special committee of the
board of trustees has canvassed
the entire country for available
men, and has decided that Dr.
Gates is the man for the place.
It is not known positively whether
or not he will accept the position,
but it is believed that he will.
Previous to the action of the
board Dr. Gates was in Topeka,
at the request of the committee,
and made an investigation cf the
conditions of Wasliburn. This
investigation proved satisfactory,
and it is understood he is willing
to become the president ot tlle
college it circumstances will per.
mit. His resignation trom the
presidency of lowa College. a
position he held [or thirteen yearsI
was due to the inability of Mrs.
Gates to live in this climate, and
if the climate at Topeka is sufﬁ-
ciently dry for her to live com-
fortably, it is reasonably sure that
he will accept.

Dr, Gates was strongly recom-
mended to the board by leading
educators, such President
Tucker ofDartmouth, Pres, Hyde
of Bowdoin. Dr, Albert Shaw
Dr Josiah Stiong, D. thl‘lsaulus.
and other nten of national reputa-
tion. All agree that Dr. Gates is
well qualiﬁed as n educator, ad-
ministrative ofﬁces and scholar
for such a position and congratu-
late Washburn upon the pl'obitbll»
ity oi securing him. In these re-
commendations our ohn filctllty,
trustees and students unite. Dr.
Gates has many loyal friends in
Grinnell who are coiiﬁtlentthat in
his new pot he will have
abun lattt success, and make
Wasliburn. which already ranks
high. due of the best colleges in
that section of the country.

IOWA. . DRAKEi5~

Game at Des Moincs Yesterday a Close
Contest.

The game between inwa and
Drake yesterday was in many ie.
spects a duplicate ottlie Dialter
Gt‘litncll game oi a week previous.
Iowa made It touch-down and
kicked goal; Drake lep'leked a
goal hour the 28-yard line.
Although Coach Best thinks the
game was clean and sportsman-
like, a disinterested observer can
hardly agree with him. The most
costly ieaiure of Drake's playing
was her offrside work and fouling
Iowa's touch down was materially
assisted by a penalty imposed up-
on Drake. Iowa's work was far
from last year's standard. She
lost the ball on downs quite as
frequently as Drake, and twice
tell back so yardsiathcr than give
upthe ball. Neither side made
any brilliant gains. partially due
to the fact that the ﬁeld was heavy
and slippery. To say the least.
the football situation in Iowa this
year is unique, in the fact that no
one of the big iour can make any
claims over the others.

STUDENTS' CONFERENCE MON—
DAY EVENING.

Recognising the value ni co
operation in the study of closely
allied subjects, several deparir
merits in the college have com-
bined to organize ior this purpose.

subjects which are so dependent
upon one another. Students of
the major classes are invited to

ans of the iiiture may know oi her
work and feel the uplifting inﬂu-
ence of her life.”
