AKE notice that Grinnell
won an interacademy der

bate. Read about it in another

column.
CARLET AND BLACK
desires to make one more
reference to the event which oc»
cured during the First part ot the
week. That the musical treat
was a perteet success is denied
by no one. It was one of the
ﬁnest opportunities ever present»
ed to a Grinnell audience. It
should not be forgotten to whose
efforts this success is due, nor
should the business men who
generously pledged their support.
The man, who did by far the
most to bring about the May
FestivalI in perseveringin the face
of repeated assertions that his
schemes were wild has done some-
thing by which he will long be re
membered. He leaves this year;
his place will be hard to ﬁll, It
is hoped that Grinnell will ape
precrate the strength and vigor he
has put into the May Festival by
making the event an annual affair.
