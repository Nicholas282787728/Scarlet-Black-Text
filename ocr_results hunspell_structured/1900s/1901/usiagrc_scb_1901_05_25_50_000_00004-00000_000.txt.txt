‘ed.

Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, Rabbi oithc

editorof the Reform Advocate and
professor of Rabbinical Literature
and Philosophy in Chicago U
versity, has been secured to deliv—

Professor Hirsch isalibcral Jew

A glance at his past life will serve
to indicate somewhat his intellect-
ualaccomplishmcnts. Hereceiv-

andrhc degrecA. M. in i875. He
became a student in the Univesity

degree Ph. D..at Leipzig. On his
return to America he occupied
successively the positions of Milr
ister of the Hat Sinai Congregzk
tion at Baltimore, Maryland, and
at Louisville, Kentucky, and is at
present Minister at theSinai Con-
gregation of Chicago.

He has been editor of vari-
ous papers, such as the Zeitgrist
of Milwaukee, Rafa/”Mr, N. Y.,
and 7715 let/om Adamo, Chicago.
Dr. Hirsch is much sought attcr
as a lecturer but owing to his
many duties is unable to deliver
but a limited number of addresses

Preliminary Debates.

Next Wednesday evening oc.
curs the preliminary debates in
theChresto andlnstitute societies,
These are the ﬁrst preliminaries
to beheld under the new system,
and the outcome is being watched
with considerable interest. In
many respects these debates are
the most important ones of the

 

year. Because of tlle fact that
the intercollegiate debaters will
be chosen from the six winners of
these debates, it is very desirable
that the best men should be enters
ed tor thcsc preliminaries. For
tlle same reason there should be
agood attendance at the meets
ings Wednesday night.

The same question will bc den
bated in both societies;7“Re-
solved, that the Government
should contract an extensive sys-
tem of irrigation works for the
dried lands."

W_
Game Declared Off.

The ball game between Grin-
nell and the Still College of
Osteopathy which was to have
been played yesterday morning
at the lcaguc park, Des Moines,
failed to materialize.

Manager Thompson went to
Des Moines, Thursday evening, to
see about the arrangements, and
sent word yesterday morning that
the game could not he pulled 06
on account of the bad condition
of the ﬁeld. This is much rec
grcttcd, because our team needs
more practise before the other
league games.
