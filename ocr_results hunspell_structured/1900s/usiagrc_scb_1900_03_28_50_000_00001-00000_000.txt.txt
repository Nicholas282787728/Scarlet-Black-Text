Lady Bountifuli

In view of the many entertaine
merits there have been during the
past few weeks, it was a fair sized
audience that greeted members of
the Calocagathian society and the
Grinnell Institute at their peform-
ance of “Lady Bountiful" last Sat-
urday evening, For along time
it has been the custom for the
Chrestomaihian and Ellis societies
to alternate with the Cnlocagathia
and the Institute in giving occae
sional entertainments, which were
supposed to represent the best re
sults of their jointefiorts. This
year, for the ﬁrst time in the his
tory of these society entertain-
ments it was decided to give a
drama of some contemporary
writer; and alter much discussion.
Pincro's “Lady Bountiful" was the
one chosen. ‘

Arthur Wing Pincro is an Eng-
lishman,now about torty-hve years
of age, who was, as a young man,
a successful actor. but who. latter—

 

ly no longer acts plays, but writes
them. He is the author of more
than a dozen dramas, two of which
have this year been performed by
Iowa College students. “Lady
Bountiful” is an interesting play.
an actable play, and a typical
Pinero play in many respects.
Pinero possesses the dramatic in—
stinct. He feels what will go well
on the stage. His dialogue moves
rapidly and contains many bright
speeches; he abounds in delicate
pathos and humor; his climaxes
are well arranged; he gives oppore
trinity for an effective use of
groupings, and in various other
ways shows an attention to the de-
tails of dramatic effect. More»
over. his plays are for the most
part, cheertul and wholesome in
tone, even according to American
standards.

The presenting ot “Lady Boun»

tlful" was a more ambitious under-'

taking than the giving of the same
author's "Sweet Lavender,” which
was done so satisfactorily though
unpretentiously by the Drama
Club a tew weeks ago. The iinr
dertaking was almost too great for
the length of time given to its
preparation; but under the direc»
tion of a competent trainer who
knew just what was to be done,
some surprising results were see
cured in the three weeks of active
work on it. Miss Archibald's
work showed especially in the as
surance with which the different
members took their parts. Each
one seemed to know just where he
should be and just what he should
do during all the time he was on
the stage. The individual
tumes and make-ups were care-
fully attended to, as well as varie
ous other details, which added not
a little to the general effect.

cose

In assigning parts for a play ot
this kind, where there are only a
limited number from which to
choose, and where the choice is
based more largely upon a knowl-
edge ot the general characteristics
or those chosen than upon any of
their previous achievements,there
is room for many misﬁts, The
selection in this case, however,was
well made. indeed, it would be
difﬁcult tor an outsider to suggest
how the assignment could have
been improved upon. The parts
of “Dennis Heron" and "Lady

Bountiful“ are exacting ones, and
Mr. Dickinson and Miss Browne
are to be congratulated upon the
measure of success with which
they carried them through. Much
of the work of the former was of a
high ordergthough he did not
seem to have the last half of the
play quite so well in hand as the
ﬁrst—and Miss Browne developed
a degree of strength that was sure
prising even to hex liiends, Per-
haps as much credit is due to Miss
Sedwick as to any of the charace
ters for her representation of Mare
garet Veale. The scene in the
third act between “Margaret” and
“Lady Bountiful'V— one which
might easily have been spoiled#
was made. as it was meant to be,
one of the most impressive ones
of the play. Both women were
at their best in it. Mr. Crantlall,
as John Veale. an uncultured, but
kindly disposed, hearty horseman.
and Miss Latvrencc as his solicir
tons spouse, were deservedly pope
ular with the audience. Mr. Wate
erman also won much merited
favor in the character of Roderick
Heron. a man so foolishly vain as
to be both pitied and despised.
Mr, Waterman is perhaps the one
of the more prominent characters
who was most consistent throtigl

out in the interpretation of hi

part.

Of the minor characters, Miss
Myers as “Trixy,” a spoilcd but
not unlovable chiltl, and Miss
Scammon as “Amelia,” a not too
tidy maid, realized well the spirit
of their parts. "Sir Richard," a
more than middle aged wooer,
with few attractive qualities other
than those of simple goodness
and patience. was the character
appropriately represented by Mr.
Frisbie. The other characters.
Mr. Eldridge as “Sir Lucian."
Miss Phelps as “Miss Brent.” Mr.
Halsey as "Vi/imple," Mr, Dignan
as “Pedgrift” and Miss Romaine
as “Mrs. Hodnutt." conducted
themselves well in the less showy
parts, and aie deserving of further
