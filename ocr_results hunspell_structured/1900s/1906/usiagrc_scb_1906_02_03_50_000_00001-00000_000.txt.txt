THE Y. M. c. A. WINS.

The Grinnell Team is Defeated by the.

lies Moincs Association Quintet in a

Fast Game. 1

The local basket ball team met de-‘
ieab at [he hands of the Des Moines
Y. M. C. A. last evening by the score
of 29 to 2|} in what was considered by
all to be one oithe llardest'ooutests
ever Didoed on the Des Moines ﬂoor.
The game was called at. 8:25 before a
rather small audience and began with
a rush, the Y. M. c. A. scoring the
ﬁrst, basket imm the ﬁeld. Both
teams were very aggressive and the
play took on somewhat. of a rough na-
tllre. The ollicials prov-ed very keen
sighted gentlemen and the play was
continually interrupted by the call or
“ioul on Y. M." or "foul on Grinnell."
The team work or both aggregations
was seriously allectcd by this unfortu-
mite circumstance.

Throughout the ﬁrst half there was
no time when the margin in score was
more than one or two points, the score
being a tie at 16, just a minute helore
time “as called. However, the Y. M.
managed to add one more basket to
their side oi the score raising it to is
to 16.

Shortly aitcr the beginning oi the
second halt it became plainly evident
that the college men were in superior
physical condition and the customary
slump on the part orGrinnell for the
ﬁrstfcw minutes did not take place,
a fact which speaks well when pre
dieting the outcome of future games.
The small margin in score was soon
overcome and the game became a
struggle to the end. Both teams were
quick to take advantage or any false
more or its opponent and play in gen-
eral was of a higher class. Calls from
the oilicialsior “rough play” did not
cease, however, and it becamea case
of Which team could miss the most
chances from the foul line. The last
two or three minutes, with the score a
tie, brought out the hardest play or
the evening, nevertheless, both teams

kept under good control anti, as is
natural in such cases, desperate chan-
ces were not taken. The Winning bas-
ket was thrown just before the whistle
blew [or time and With the one addir
tional point. from award the game
closed 20 to 26 in inror of the Associa-
tion.

The same teams will meet on the
local lloor Feb. 10 and the contest will
undoubtedly be one or the best eier

“AN EVENING.”

epic Read Gives ,An Interpretation of
Some oi His Works, Next Friday
Evening. Scar Salt Thursday.

The ﬁfth number on the Lecture
course will diﬂer slightly from preced»
ing ones in the character of the mat-
ter presented, but there will be Do do-
narf’ulc from the general high stand-
ard set by other numbers of the course.
Those who know Opie Read through
his writings, will be more than anxious
to hear him in his own rendition Oi his
works; those who enjoy a ﬁrst-class in»
terpretdticn 01' standard literature
will enjoy this entertainment from
that point or riew.

Little introduction of Obie Ilcarl as
a writer is necessary. Few American
literary men are alive who have been
so Widely read and enjoyed by all class-
es 01 people. His walk has been of a
character that attracts everyone who
loves life. He is human. He mites
so simply yet so artistically thcthe
reaches the hearts of all his readers.
0n the platform Mr. Read is always
entertaining. He is as great a deliner
ator of character there as with the
pen, and in the interpretation of his
own Words is an artist. Ho Wins his
audience from the start; he is Such a
big, manly man, lull of life, and with
a big heart to go with his big body.
He has a voice especially suited to the
use to which he puts it, and uses it
with wonderful effect. A Southerner
himseli the southern brogue comes
naturally to his lips. while his long as-
sociation with colored people gives
him the negro dialect almost as freely.
with this ability he is able to (trill
something to his characters which is
impossible in print, and the stories he
tells mean more than ever to those
who admire his genius ,

This all-around American comes Fri-
day, February 9, atthc Congregational
church. Whether you know him or
not. through his Writings. a failure to
see and hear him will be an opporttt
nity lost.

The number drawing will be at
Viets so Yeager s, Wednesday, Feb. 7,
and Thursday morning. The seat sale

WHAT EDUCATION MEANS,

Professor Stoops Gives an interesting
Toll: on the Meaning or Education
at Friday Morning chapel.

The Friday morning service was in
charge of ProiessorJ. D. Stoops, and
he devoted the time to a discussion Of
education, its value and meaning.
Professor Stoops is a iavorite speaker
with the students and his remarks re-

eelved the closest attention.

The ability to learn is not the same
thing as to become educated. There
are no creatures that cannot learn but
the majority or them can hardly be
termed educated. One’s ability to be-
come educated is the test OI Ono’s in-
telligence. Humanesperienceisguid-
ed by general actions: conduct is action
guided by general truths. All iorms
of life are manifestations of activity.
thab distinguishes a human person
in ills action is that his reasoning pow-
cr can guide his activity. Functions
of intellect cannot, be separated from
conduct. Thinking guides actions;
man acts Lliru thinking while animals
act without thinking

Education does not belong to the
sphere OI intelligence only but is in-
separable irom the whole sphere of
liier BIOralsIanol education are synon-
ymous at Grinnell; not so in a good
many other places, Intellectual train-
mg must be coordinated to your
whole experience. Morals, conduct,
and behavior are fundamental in edu-
cation. Education is without purposc
unless it leads to conduct. He who
neglects the cultivation Oi emotions
or feelings lacks one Of the constitus
tional elements in education. Intel'
lecc is impossible out of relation to
conduct. Education is not something
tacked oil—not an accomplishment.
Whether you will be educated or not
is not open to argument. Lire says
educate yourself to meet your envi«
ronment. Education is the warp,
woof, and texture or a rational person.
The ditrerencc between a genius and
an idiot is education. In a democrat-
ic loud like ours, education rnllst be
thc prime, deepest, and most central
thing in our cil'l l

WHY GAMEIS BAD!

Prolessor Adams at Wisconsin Univers-
ily suircs the Keynote in on ads
dress berorc the Alumni
Association.

At the annual banquet ot the Wis-
consin alumni association Prof. T. S.
Adams, iaculty director oi athletics
spoke on the subject, “The athletic
aristocracy.” The few extracts from
his speech are worth thinking about

“ While there are some 3,500 students
in Wisconsin University” said Proi.
Adams. “N at more than twenty-ﬁve
or Lhil‘bycan reasonably be said to have
received any desirable training in foot-
ball—that training which comes from
heal-tr and enthusiastic participation
in competitive games. All the howl
and all the iuss and all the reiorm has
been about a couple or dozen of young
men on whom the admiration or the
student body, the money or the ath-
letic association, and thc‘time oi the
faculty were as lavishly expended as if
they had bccn delul-gods and not simp-
ly ﬁne, manly 3 ourlg Americans. whom
—i\'ith the ex ce pt i on of a few
prolessionals who have crept in among
themiit is a pleasure to know. What
I have to say arises lrorn no resent-
merit against the thirty aristocrats.
My resentment comes irom the iact
that the whole student body are not
also aristocrats.

“We have set up intercollegiate
victory as the highest aim and am-
bition or student lire,” Proicssor
Adams went on to point out. “At the
root or the greatest eVll of the situae
tion is the inordinate, passionate,
characteristically it ru e r i c a u, and
hence characteristically exaggerated,
desire to get to the top, The popular

mind ranks a victory over Michigan as
agreater achievement tllcna scien-
tiﬁc discovery. Tie average college
student would inti iteiy rather be a
subquartcr back than make Phi Beta
Kappa."

“If you want lootball and not a
iootball team." said Pl'nfess'll dam;
in closing "You must unile t'tutl
