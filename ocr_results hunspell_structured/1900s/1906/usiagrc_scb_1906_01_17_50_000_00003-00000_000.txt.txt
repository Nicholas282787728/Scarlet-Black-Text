The following are a few extracts
taken from an address delivered by
Principal C. H. Horn at the State
Teachers Association on the Advan-
tages of the Academy.

”1 now come to what I consider one
or the very greatest advantages or the
associated Academy, perhaps it is the
greatest. It lives in an educational
atmosphere stronger than it could it—
self create. It breathes the viral air
01 College life. II? is the most BLVD!-
able possible place for being intellect-
ually as well as spiritually born again.
The inspiring power 0! the Academy
by its associations With the college is
increased beyond measure. All that
is attractive and inspiring in the col-
lege life and wurk becomes known to
the Academy student. He becomes
intimately acquainted with the in-
terests, the work, the diversions, the
follies and the heroisms of college stu-
dents. The spring sunshine and the
warm rain no more surely cause every
vital seed to germinate and grow than
does college life cauSe every latent
germ of intellectual power and high
aspiration to awake.

”Then too, the Academy student
shines many privileges in common
with the college student. He has the
use of thesame library, museum, heats
the same public lectures, Shares in
some common student activities,
enters freely into some of the college
enthusiasms, is trained in the same
gymnasium, and lunder 8. skilled
physical director engages in such alt/hr
letics as is sale and wholesome. The
beneiits or living in the larger and
stronger life of the College. of seeing
the value of an education exempliﬁed
in so many stronger. more highly
trained and enthusiastic men and
women is, Ithink, beyond cuculatiou.

“The student/s plan and method of
work must not be omitted from this
discussion. The Academy student
does his work more after the fashion
of thecollege student, and this fashion
is precisely the fashion of real life. He
must ﬁnd his own place tor study,
systematize his own Work, put him-
self at his task and very largely work
out his own salvation.

“The result is that he develops initir
ative, independence, and the Sense of
responsibility in it remarkabla degree.
He learns to Study without being
watched by tha teacher. and in my
judgment far more ellicicntly. 0n ac
count at thekliﬂerent conditions in the
Academy greater responsibility in
their literary und social Work my be
Safely pullllpnn the students, while in
certain important respects it is easier
to put them under restrictions."
