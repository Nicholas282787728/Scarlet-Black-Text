HE Editor Of the SCARLET AND
BLACK receiveda communicar
cation last term from an alumna of
the institution which contained some
interesting if not startling state-
ments. The letter is not. published
for the reason that. it containedsev-
eral things which would not he of in-
terest to our readers and we are only
led to common on it because we hp-
lieve some explanation ought to be
made. We have an idea. that the
writer is laboring under a. false liu‘
pzession and that she does not (ully
understand conditions or Is not no-
quainted With student; life at Grinnell
at the present. time.

The writer states as one purpose or
her letter "a defense oi the Women
who graduated in the early (his.
You may thinlr We were \‘ery Old
fashioned for I believe there were
none of us who could say “we had
danced all our lives and were just as
good as you were." The writer goes
on 1.0 say that the early graduaces
used their own discretion in the niair
ter of dancing and that they refrained
hecausu ”tripping the light fantastic”
did not conform with their Christian
ideals. She infers from the state-
ment that the only thing which pre«
vents the college girls from dancing
now, is the fact that the college for-
bids it. The letter closes With the
signiﬁcant statement that ”if human
nature has so changed, or conditions
have so changed that people can new
dance all their lives and be as good as
anyone, dancing is not now contrary
to the vows of those old~rashioned
Christians."

The editor has no desire co carry on
a discussion as to the evils or beneﬁts
derived from dancing, but we do wish
to state that at the present time there
is no cause for worry along that linc.
We believe that there are lust as
many studenm who do not dance now
days as there were in inrrner years.

Furthermore. and with all due re-
gard to the Writers’ views. We insist
that. we have known people and do
now who danced cndyec "were just
as good and did lust as much good” as
some others whom we know. 01
course, these people did not dance all
their lives but then We never heard of
Very many that did. After all it is
Only amatber of opinion but we be-
lieve that the ideals are lust-as higll
today as they were twenty-five years
ago, and that there are Just, as many
Chrisoian students and that they are
fully as good followers of the Master
of Galilee as this institution has ever
known. It is natural that there
should be some who do wander from
the "narrow way“ bun the Vlisb ma-
jority are still maintaining the ideals
and traditions of this institution.
Evils may e Sh but dancing is not
one of them. Neither is it kept out
by rule Or tradition but for the simple
mason that dancing and good scholar-
ship cannot go hand in hand and so

case. A college library under present
day conditions does not mean a chaot-
ic collection of books. but a Cai‘eiullv
catalogued selection oi books acLually
needed. housed in a building especial
ly adapted to the purpose and wiih its
own staii ol administrative Ollicers.

“The third criterion has to do with
the personnel of the teaching force.
The value of the opportunity implied
in the multiplication of courses, oi the
accumulation of books, of ills ad-
dltions to apparatus and equipment
depend entirely upon one instructors
who use them. This value is large or
small as the iusrrucmr is large or
small.

”After all. the most, dilh‘cult proh-
leui of securing teachers Who will give
value, full value, to the books, the ap-
paratus. College education at. the
present day is not pitched on an 3300
or a $1,000 scale. It is pitched higher.

“The college of the twentieth cen»
tury must mcec twentieth century
conditions. The problem of the Colv
legc authorities is to see to it that the
proper adjustment is made between
the college of this century and its ed-
ucacioncl environment. The college,
like auyothcr human institution, is
needed because it responds toa need.
This does not mean that the college is
to iorgco the past and neglect the fu-
ture, giving heed only to the present.
It is to (lo-relate the three and give
them proportion such validity in each
individual. so that a genuine develop-
ment is achieved."

”The movement of the world will
not wait. on the college; the college
must accelerate its pace. The logic
of the situation iscruel, but it is in-
evitable."

MEN'S GYMNASIUM WORK.

Two extra gymnasium classes for
men will be started this coming weelr,

cult work. This class Will meet on
