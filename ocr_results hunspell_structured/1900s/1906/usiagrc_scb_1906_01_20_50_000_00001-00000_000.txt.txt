GRINNELL MEETS DEFEAT.

The Slale University and Cedar Rapids
High School Win Victories From
Scarlet and Black Team.
IowaCitj-, Jan, Ill, (speciallr-Grinnell
and Iowa City, the old Lime rivals in
basket ball, met Thursday at the Uni
versity armory, the latter winning by
the score or 20713. The game was
called at 4:30, alter a short prelimi-
nary wrestling match, and was played
before a rather large and enthusiastic
audience. Iowa succeeded in scoring
the ﬁrst basket after only a few min-
utesolplay; however Grinnell duplir
outed the not on short notice and the
fastest exhibition of basket ball ever
played by the two teams. followed
throughout the ﬁrst half. It was r 'y
evident that the two teams were ﬁght—
ing with that Old-time rivalry Which
has characterized the play of so many
previous contests between the two in-
stitutions. Much to the surprise of

many spectators, and even the players
themselves, the Grinnell men succeed-

ed in. in actual ., the University play»
hrs in. their own style or play during
the ﬁrst, half. Barton, Rainsell and
Buckner succeeded in scoring Iowa’s
three baskets during this hair, which
with one award put their side oi score
at J ior the ﬁrst half. De Hadn, Wild-
er and Fisllei‘,'each scored baskets for
the scarlet and black, which together
with three fouls and one award gave
Grinnell the lead by the score or 10 to 7

The second halt started but. with a
much greater display or “ginger” on
the part or Iowa while the Grinnell
men plainly sliowcd the cdects or this
hard ﬁght during the ﬁrst. half.

Iowa came back with a rush and
set a pace altogether too fast ior their
exhausted opponents. The ball was in
Iowa’s territory and handled by Iowa
men the larger part oi the time dun
ing the half and by pretty goal throw-
ing nine goals were added to their side
of the score besides some awards. Do-
Ilaan scored the only basket [or Crin-
nell during this half while one tool
was recorded for the Scarlet and Black.

The game was free from all Wrang-
iiug and the best of feeling between
the players and omcials existed
throughout the game.

Cedar Rapids, Jan. 19. (special).~'1‘he
Grinnell basket ball team played the
second game on its trip this arternoon

and met a second defeat at the hands
of the Cedar Rapids High School. The
game was called at i o‘clock sharp and

was played berore a inirly large :anrl
especially enthusiasticaudience. Grill-
nell bcgan scoring early in the game
but at no time was able to make the
breach in the score very large. The
High School played with a rush and
had to be watched every minute.
Grinnell signals worked ﬁne during
the iirst part oi the game but became
less eﬁective as the play went on. The
ﬁrst half ended with the score or 19 to
11 in iavor oi the Scarlet and Black.
Both teams came back at the begin-
ning of the second half but due to
some lancy goal throwing by the high
school players the margin of the score
was wiped out and it became a light
to the end. It was during this half
that the old repeated argument, that
'oliieiais play to much oi the game was
demonstrated. Absolute disregard
for any rules of the game was displayed
by the Referee during the second hair
with the usual eirect to the unfortun-
ates. The game ended 34 Lo 33 iii
favor or the High school. The Cedar
Rapids men played ahard, fast and
scientiﬁc game and deserve credit for
the same. Grinncil played as well as
could possibly. be expected after the
hard work against Iowa, Thursday
afternoon. The line up and summary:

ELLIS.

The program at Ellis Society on Fri-
day wasin the nature or a revival or
old-time customs, being adebite be
tween three Sophomore and three
Freshmen girls. It was the ﬁrst Kle-
bate of the year in Ellis. and proved
vel'yiliterestlng. The question: “Re-
solved, tliat women’s clubs are beneﬁ-
cial“ was discussed by Clare Lyon,
Bessie Uhl and Emma Suckow, on the
ailirinativc, and Lois Lowrey, Agnes
Johnson and Helen Taylor on Llle neg-
atire. The judges were Mrs. Steiner,
Miss new and Miss Kellenbnrgcr, and
returned a unanimous vote for the di-
ﬁrinative. Music was iurnishcd by a
piano duct by Miss Lisor and Miss Ma-
son, and a solo by Mary Kleespie, and
the aiternoon closed with aslioit busir
ness meeting alter an intermission. It
is to be hoped that more debates on
questions of special interest to college
girls, may be debated in Film during
the year, for while the arguments pre-
senled by the speakers may or may not
be helpful, yet the discussion cannot
fail to rouse interest in the subject. A
report or the Play Committee was giv-
en at llie business meeting, to the el-
rect that “A Bachelor's Romance”
had been chosen as the drama to be
presented by Lila Chi-esbo and Ellis so-
cieties. The play is written by an
American author, Miss Norion, and
was played ﬁrst with great success by
Sol Smith Russell and Annie Russell

COLLEGE HONESTY.

Deg-1n Main Cnmmems unlhe Present Day

At the Friday morning chapel
service Dciiii Main spoke concerning
college ethics in general but with
special reference to modern football,
He ﬂavored considerable time to the
game though making no statements
which werenew or radical. rlis whole
talk was based upon aspecch which
President Roosevelt. delivered some-
time ago. Tile President said, “There
are two classes of actions, honest and
dishonest, between which there is a
fundamental distinction. At present
we have a new kind of honesty, known
as law honesty, or in other words, the
avoidance of things which WWm send
aman to prison. This leads f0 “‘9’
question, ‘Is it legal?‘, rather that:
‘Isit right?‘ Many things are legal
which are ethically wrong.”

Using this as a text, so to speak, the
Dean took up the subject of football.
“In football, a train 01 evils were in-
troduced against which there were no
rules. The tendency is to put players
out of the game and asaresult we
have developed auroral weakness. A
spirit or this sort is inﬁnitely worse
than abroken leg or head, for hun-
dreds or men adjust themselves to
these inise standards. Football rep
resents American business methods;
botliarc on the same iooLing. But
this should not be the case because
business methods should not enter in-
to college sports. Centers of intel-
lectual life ought to be the homeof
tlie impossible ideals, which Mathew
Arnoldrclls about. Said a busincss
man recently, ‘College must give
honest business men to the world.
Prime test or a collcgc is to teach
honesty and ruirnesr. College sports
should emphasize squnvc dealing l

”Intellectual qualities should be on
equalily with weight and size. Equal
ityoi opportunity should be the ﬁrst
element in onygaine. The ﬁnepniiits
or a game should be open to the crowd,
notlclt to the oiliciais alone. Tcud-
ency or unfair plays should be restrict-
ed by a heavy loss on part oloiicnders.
The game should be for all college men
and not ior a professional class. And
ﬁnally, college slels should be games
in which the moral qualities are on
the same level with physical qualities.
