FRESHMEN DEBATE SATURDAY.

The iirst Inter-society dcbtic be»
tween Llie Freshmen of the m0 litera:
ry societies will take place Saturday
eveniilgiu the college chapel. The
contest promises to be unusunily inter.
tasting and a large attendance sliould
reward the efforts of the debaters.
The quesitiou is one of Vital import.-
ance in present doy oiioil-s. Tile ques~
tion:

Resolved, That in cities of the Uni»
ted States of over- 500,000 inhabitants,
the political conditions are such as to
render- mimicipltl ownership and upe-
l’ntiull 0f stloeb railways undesirable.

Grinuell Institute Will be represent-
ed by E. II. Muuson, ‘V. R. Men, and
L. M. Thompson. The Clllestomit-
thion richotei-s are D. E. Campbell, H.
G. Kinsley and H. B. Quartcll.

Tile Y. P, S. C. E. Will give Ll. social
Saturday evening Jon. 7 in the pol--
lots or the Congregational church. A
speciol slloi't program will be given.

AT OTHER COLLEGES.

Wilburiord thvis, age 23, a. student
ofKeokuk Medicol College, commit-
ted suicide ill his room at the Grand
Hotel, Keokiilc, Iowo January 2155.
Despoudency over ill health, money
matters and college studies are the
only causes lincwn for the riot. Notes
of farewell to his parents and chums
and alettel addressed to Mabel Spoon-
er oi Grinnell reveal nothing. Davis'
home is zit Cinciunmti, Iowa.

“The University oi Nebraska has at
lost broken into the “Big Five” (le-
boting league cmsistiug oiilinneso-
to, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Chico-
go and Michigan. The University oi
Wisconsin has decided to meet Ne-
braska in debate ond, although no
deﬁnite agreement has yet been made
itis‘ quite lilieiy iiiut the match will
occur at Madison in the spring."

The committee or the legislature
appointed to visit the State Normal
School ot Cedar Frills, concur in the
criticism mode by the commission
which investigated the bool-d otcon-
trol idea. “Upon investigation,“ the
committee will say, “we ﬁnd that the
salaries payed at the normal are
higher than those played at othevstnle
institutions.” The cainllliLLee ﬁnds
in impossible to recommend the addi-
tional 512,000 asked for solar-its in tile
institution. but. believe that the
buildings asked lor ore needed.

Over two hundred students failed
to pass the examinations at the end
oi last term at the University of Cali-
fornia and as it result will be refused
register-mien when college opens for
the next term. This is the largsst
nuilibel' that hos ”illlnired out” in
monyyeors. The cause is attracted
to over indulgence in college activities

sold to have place our-mg the past
term.
