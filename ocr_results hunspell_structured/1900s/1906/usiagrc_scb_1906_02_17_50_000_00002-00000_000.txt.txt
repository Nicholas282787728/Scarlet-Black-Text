HE proposal of President Main to
establish a council, composed of
students and faculty, will surely meet
with the approval or all concerned.
A large number of institutions have
tried this plan and it has Worked very
successfully. Of course there are not
a great many things which would re-
quire the attention of the council. and
yet matters come up frequently which
demand the cooperation of both
parties. We believe that the forma-
tion of a council along the lines sug—
gested by the president Would result
in greater harmony between the stu-
dents and the administration. It has
always been the policy of the presi-
dentrto cooperate with the students
and we are glad to see that this policy
is not. only goihgw be continued but
even extended.

EXT: Thursday will be the one
hundred and seventyrfourth an-
niversary of the birth ofGeorge Wash-
ington. It has not been the custom
at Grinnellwhave any special exer-
else: or to observe the day in anyway
outof the ordinary. In many states
it isa legal holiday and the schools
and colleges close for the day and hold
special services. We understand that
a slmilinr movement is on foot in
Grinnell and that exercises apropos to
the occasion will be arranged. Scan-
LET syn BLACK believes that some
noticeought to be taken ortheday.
although we do not advocate asus-
pension oi recitatiohs unless special
services are held to commemorate the
day. it is well to stop in our busy
life, and do honor to the ﬁrst great
American. His career lrom the time
that hecut the cherry tree until he
delivered hisrarewell address is worthy

of study and of emulation. The worlr
of Washington grows brighter with
every passing year and ills memory
deserves all the glory that it receives.
.\ lrm Irll(l\llcrln,;e of the lire and
oi the Intheroiour country will
not come amiss to any college student.
Let us remember the day. not in cele-
bration. but with a spirit of reverence

and devotion to the mighty dead.
