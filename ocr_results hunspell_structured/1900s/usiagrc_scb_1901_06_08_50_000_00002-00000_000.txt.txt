a score ot’2r»lo. Until nearly the
last of the game the toivn had see
cured but two runs, but a change
at pitchers in the college team re-
sulted in a landslide which netted
eight runs for the town. No great
amount oi money was realized,
but such proceeds as there were go

is an article among the athr

letic notes which to say the least,
is very inconsiderate. It is to be
hoped and generally is true that
there exists a triendly tcelrrrg be
tween colleges, but the printing oi
such articles as this is not likely
to encourage. such a spirit. To
say that charges made against a
student otsister institution are true
and to make this sort of an asserr
tion before the student has a
chance to answer in his own der
fense is inconsiderate and unfair.
The charges reterred to have not
been deﬁnitely proven as the Co”-

considered innocent until proven

Graduating Recital.
1n the minds or many who nt-
tendcd the recital last Wednesday
evening, the program was the best
rendercdinyears. Bothgraduates
pertormed in a manner which
should ﬁll their instructor with
proud satisfaction and which cer
tainly did entertain a chapel full
oflisteningtiiends. Sucllaneven-
ing is always apt to contain mime
berslittle appreciated by those not
musically educated and therefore
lessattractivctothem. Butitmay
be truthfully said that the program
as a whole was brilliant,‘ attractive
and thoroughly enjoyable. _The

 

pedal work, but that of Wednes-
day eveningwasremarkably clean.
The tones were distinct and the
runs perfectly clear. The gradu-
atcs may feel satisﬁed with their
ivork as may also Mrs. Cole. This
is the seventhclass graduated unr
der her charge.

Individual comment might se-
lect the following as deserving of
special mention: The group un-
der No.2 Miss Bobzin played ex-
ceptionally well, the Rondo in D
Major being probably considered
by those in the audience as hei
best ot the evening. The \lalse
Impromptu. [Vluislaow/ei, was also
very pleasing on account of the
life and vivaeity otits style. Mu-
sical critics admired the rendition
oi the sonata No. 14. D Major,
lilo/inn, by Miss Cadwell, as a come
plete interpretation of it requires
longrsustained work. The beauty
or tone coloring in the Sketch, Due
hair, was very pronounced. while
Le Zephyr, Grimaldi, and the two
selections trorn C/Lzzminmt'l gave a
brilliant ﬁnale to the evening's
program, Mrswmicomh kindly
assisted. Her ﬁrst selection, Gae
to Sleep, Fir/m, sang in sott, low
tones; was peculiarly adapted to
her voice and was very effective
Her second selection. Adoration,
it should be noticed was composed
by our own Prof. Olds,
