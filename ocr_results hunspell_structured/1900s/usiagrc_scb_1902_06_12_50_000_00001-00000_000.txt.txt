DEAN MAIN'S ADDRESS.

It would be impossrble for me to
express adequately to you the deep
sense of appreciation l have of the
honor which you, sir, as the represene
tative of the Board of Trustees, have
just conferred upon me. 1 am deeply

 

conscious or the fact that it is all ex-irected your own Virtues and “ill! uncon-

pres on ot your contidence lrl my tit-
ness fora work of great importance
to Iowa College. As such 1 ant plo-
l'oiiiidlv llloved by it. Still wish to
assure you, srr, that I am less moved
by this pl'e iorl ot the honorable
Board of illstees, tlralrl am by the
keen sense of personal lesponsrbility
which it brings to me. As I review
the past of the college, as 1 contem-
plate the present, 5 l forecast the
years to come, l ask myself with deep
humility of sp it if I am tlle man ioi
this work. The coming ears must
answer that question. he faculty.
the students, the alumni, all the per-
sons and forces which make lowa
College—these must . lswer‘ for me
when l, as a living presence, am no
longer a part of this great institution.

'1 he heroic history that the fathers
made who gave of their small sub-
stance to foster and build up to a vig
orous maturity this college, lays a
claim uporl us.
themselves to the college demand of
us some heroism, some servrce that is
commensurate with theirs. Thes:
present days in this great common‘
wealth, with its amazing possilrili ies,
with its developing irldtlstries, with its
growing Institutions, and its rapidly
increasing populatioll, demand of its
all the fullest expression otourenergy
our understanding, alld our powers
Shall we lay hold on the future?
Shall we rlnite the heroism of the past
and the possibilities of the present, to
make a college worthy ot that past
and of the twentieth century, and
worthy of the centuries to come?
There is nothing lacking iii the con»
ditions to call forth all the enthusiasm
and all the powers, both of body and
soul of strong men and strong wo-
men.

I speak \lith reverence ot' the ele-
nlent of joy for me in this day of
days. The joy for me is that I am
thus permitted to put my little—my
little enthusiasm, my little strength,
my little life,7into the keeping of
this great college, to contribute some-
what to its lrigll ideals, to its creative
mission and to its loving service under
God in the world.
