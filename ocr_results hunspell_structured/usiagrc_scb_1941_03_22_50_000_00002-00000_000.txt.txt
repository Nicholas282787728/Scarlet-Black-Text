. Credit Where Credit Is Due

One thing seems certain when the events of
the past week are reviewed, and that is
that politics are at Grinnell, and they're
here to stay. Now when the excitement of
the convention and various drives and cam-

.Ainv cl-mnm
mu. meder
.llnben. Green

paigns has died down, and the smoke has ,

cleared away, it is evident that some credit
is due somewhere. A lot of its goes to the
revitalized Student Council and the Elections
committee, but the most part of the credit
is due Bob Young, who, not only in the new
method, but in other matters of student goV»
‘ ernment, has done an excellent job. Now in
many years has Grinnell seen a student pre-
sident with the drive, organization and ad-

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ministrative ability that Young has shown.

His was no easy job; he took student govc
eminent at a low ebb and has given it a
new respect, a new campus impoltance, and
leaves for his successor an organized and
effective Student Council. And there are
other things he has exhibited: courage in
his convictions, and the strength to stand
up and say the things he believes in, These
are the kind of things that will insure any
man's success.

But much credit should also go to the
students who by a revived interest in affairs
governmental have made a superior Council
president possible. The new president, Kent
Hampton, has had a high mark set for him,
but the students have the confidence in him
necessary as shown by the vote Tuesday.
The outgoing presidentand the new Student
Council have given self-government a need»
ed push; its up to Hampton and the stu-
dents now to keep the ball rolling.

O Tomorrow’s Vespers

The problem of attendance at Vespers has
in the last two years become a knotty one.
Attendance has fallen off; there are many
who never go; yet there is probably no one
on the campus who would care to See this
splendid old tradition done away with, Th 'e
is apparent unanimity, too, in the feeling
that the addresses have been too long and
that the music is the best part of the ser»
Vice,

With this in mind, the newly organized
Board of Religion is experimenting with to
morrow afternoon’s Vespers. The time has
been changed to 5:15 p. m., half an hour
later than usual; the program is to be al—
most entirely composed of music.

We know it is spring; but by 5:15 the
afternoons are still beginning to be chilly.
If you are one of the numerous Gm'nnellians
who always intend to go to Vespers and
never get there, we suggest that you choose
tomorrow’s sellvice. That is the only way
anyone can know whether the experiment
is a success or not.

To The Editor:
In our recent Grinnell pol ’cal
campaign there appeared as usual
the old plea for a council prcsv
dent who would reprcscnf the
Students, and, as nearly as I can
make out from various state-
mcnfs heard. who would ignore
the faculty and the administra-
tion. It is a mystery to me how
any THINKING person can fall
for such an absurd idea.

Just what is Grinnell anyway?

As I see it. it is composed of
two groups of people. On one
hand there is the faculty and the
administration, men and women
who have lived here a good many
years, and who will be here a
good many years more. They are
the continuity of Grinnell; 3 body
of pasf experience. What happens
here is of vital importance to

gnnizniion.

And what should be the funcc
tlon of Student government on
the campus?

There are two possibilitle, it
seems to me. We can limit ou
Selves Strictly to student into

ed difficulties? The increased
expense? Hard water would be
more expensive because if re—
quires more heat to convert it

the inside of the boiler, causing
a grcot loss of efficiency on the
part of the producer of the steam.
The adv-outages of using Arbor
Lake water are obvious in see.

But what of the smell that. has
caused so mllch complaints on
the port of collcgc students?
Spciiklng frankly. the odor comes
from decayed vegetable matter,
You soc, ci-inncll has a cunning
lsclo, a corn cmuuug factory.
It is located about a quarter of
a mile from Arbor Lake. The
corn husks lusf year were placed
in an immense pit, slightly
smaller than the’ space occupied
by a men’s domllol'y or women‘s
cottage. Juices from this heap
seep down into Arbor Lake and,
when thaws come, may get
out of hand, causing the stench
in the hot water.

The Iowa Southern employs a
chemist here at Grinnell whose
job it is to, remove the smcll if
economically possible. Despite all
attempts to stop it, the smell. be
ing volatile, stays with the hot
water and steam, while the im<
purines are left behind. Meyers

the water had an aVll smell, it
was perfectly pure.
