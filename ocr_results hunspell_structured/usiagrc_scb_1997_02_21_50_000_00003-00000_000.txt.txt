Profiles in Experimental College: Homebrew and Naked People

Life Drawing studies the human form

Terry McNamara instructs beer enthusiasts

Due to federal laws, a sizeable por
tion of the Grinncll community will
not have the opportunity to partake
in one of the more unique educar
tional experiences that the newly
formed Experimental College has to
offer, During the recent Experiiiienr
tal College registration, Terry
McNamara ‘97 was asked by many
people under the age of twenty one
whetliertiic rules could somehow be
circumvented to allow thetn to take
his class: TheArt of Homebrew. Un-
fortunately, iti order for McNamara
to receive funds front President
Pamela Ferguson he had to make
sure that all of his pupils were of le
gal drinking age.

Technicalities aside, McNamara is
gearing up to teach his class of six
the intricacies of brewing beer at
home. McNamara is well versed in
this subject, “I started brewing when
I was a senior in high school," he
said, When asked how, at the lender
age of eighteen, he got his hands on
a beer kit McNamara explained that
his father got a homebl'ew kit as a
gift and never used it. “My mom let
me try that thing out," said
McNamara with a smile.

After brewing a few batches vainr
egar. McNamara made his first
succesl'ul batch of beer and a
brewmaster was born. McNamara
plans to make a career out of brew—
ing beer. He is currently completing
an internship with the Cord Avenue
Brewing Company in Des Moines
and plans to enter the industry after
graduation

The simple kits that McNamara
started out with consist of a ready-
made malt mixture with a packet of
yeast in the lid which he brewed in
bottles, He has come a long way
since those early days, McNamara
now custom orders his ingredients
according to the style of beer he plans
to brew. grinds his own ingredients
and brews them in kegs.
McNamara's class will not be grinda
ing their own ingredients but they
will be using McNamara’s extensive
knowledge of brewing to start with

custom ingredients according to the
type of beer they Wish to brew,

The first session this Saturday wtll
serve to educate the class about the
intricacies oflioinebrewing and pier
pare for the following week's class
when they will begin to brew their
beer. “You have to learn how the ills
gradients interact With each other,"
said McNamara, Once that is accom-
plished, added McNamara, “you can
vary {recipies]" to produce the char-
acteristics you want your beer to
have,

The class will be brewing during the
second and fourth sessions. These
sessions will be run like a lab. The
overall brewing process will take
four hours but there will be plenty of
down time during which the class
members can sample their creations
and discuss brewing techniques
“We‘ll be drinking the batches within
two weeks ofthe day we start them."
said McNamara. Working in teams
of two, the class members will have

a choice of what type of beer they
wish to brew. McNamara will on-
courage the class to brew many dif-
ferent varieties of beer to provtde
them With an overview ofthe differr
ent processes that go into making
each type of beer. By the end of the
six week class. McNamara’s students
will have biewed a total of six 5 gal—
lon kegs of beer. “We plan to have
some sort of party at the end," com-
mented McNamara,

McNamara has no reservations
about teaching his arts to others. even
though he has never done it before.
“I‘ve been doing this so long thatt
won't even need notes,” he said.
McNamara added a word of thanks
to President Ferguson who gave him
the funding be needed to proVide
materials for the class He also
thanked ExCo for the opportunity to
share his expertise with others,
“ExCo is a great forum to have this
class in." he said. “This class will be
more successful as a part ofExCo."

 

The brains behind EXCo: J .R. Osborn
and David Groppe discuss their Vision

“First college west of the Missis-
sippi to award a degree to an Afri-
canrAmerican student," “First col-
lege in the U.S. to institute a formal
degree program in political science."
Considering the extent to which the
Grinncll community emphasizes and
is proud ofits revolutionary history,
it is not surprising that an idea like
the Experimental College has gained
widespread support and interest
among Grinncllians,

Experimental College, or ExCo.
was first con-

signiﬁcant time into planning and ad
ministrating ExCo. In addition, many
professors were reluctant to support
the credited version of ExCo the
three had originally envisioned.

After two successful student inllia~
iives during the spring and fall or ‘95
indicated interest in the program,
Groppc and Osborn decided to put
together a provisional non—credited
slate of ExCo classes this semester,
The response to this initial version
of ExCo has cxceeded their most
optimistic expectations. A total of 14
classes on topics ranging from the
Beat wniers to MeXican folk danc»

ing are currently underway, and over

see ExCo fulfilling a number of im-
portant roles iii a liberal arts educa~
tion. Perhaps the most important goal
ofEch is simply to encourage diar
logue among students. professors,
faculty, and community members,
and to manifest the concept of de-
mocracy in education. “ExCo pro-
motes responsibiiity for oiie's own
education by making students theme
selves a more involved part of the
educational process." Groppe come
merited.

Another goal of ExCo is to suppler
merit the traditional curriculum with
classes that involve more cxpci’icnr
ital-based learning. Beyond simply

This year there have been many
“experimental” programs instituted
at Grinncll as a result ofdirect inter-
action between members of the stu-
dent body and the faculty and staff
of Grinnell College, These changes.
including a new foosball table in
Harris lounge, selfrserve lines and
deli bars at Quad and Cowlcs, and
modifications ofthe board plan, have
been widely praised. These successes
have encouraged further initiatives
aimed at taking advantage of student
creativity. One oftiiese programs IS
the Experimental College.

The Experimental College has
piqued the curiosities of many stu-
dents wuh its wide army of intrigu-
ing courses including beer brewingi
fool bagging, and one dedicated en-
tirely to Woody Allen movies. Per-
haps the most exotic course avail-
able, however, is Life Drawing, This
course, the brainchild ol'student len
Sandler, was designed with the pur-
pose of provrding opportunities for
students to “gain experience create
ing an based on the human body" in
addition to also“being the subiect for
such art." The class entails two hours
a week ofcreating art, through Wllﬂlr
ever media an individual student pre—
fers. ranging from charcoal and pen-
cil drawings to sculpture and photogr
raphy.

Life Drawing, conceived of last
spring. was a response to the institue

tionaiized Grinncll Art Department.
in which art is created undei a “flo-
rescent light". “ItproVides something
outside of the art department faculty
critique," cxplained Shaka
McGIotlen. in this class, the stile Crl»
terion ofcxcellerlcc is not the whim
of the professor, but more “the re
sponse of peers " lit the beginning, a
small group of students seeking an
alternative way oi‘siiariiig their love
of art and the human body conducted
the course in a small room in the
basemeniot’ Steiner. Currently, there
are twelve students in the course and
meet in an apartment.

While ﬁgure drawmg is not new to
art classes here at Grinncll, what is
new
is that students will actually be both
artists and models The idea behind
the class is that creating art based on
the human fomi is wonderful, and
should be done in a comfortable ate
iiiosphere in which artists are both
subjects and creatois of art.“ come
merited Jen Sandlcr. "I purposely did
not want to hire models, because i
think that modeling gives artis
insight into the artistic process, and
because I think tiie atmosphere im-
proves ifthere is no element of“rent-
ing out" of bodies to draw, but rather
an exchange ol'our bodies as subjects
of art with other artists who will re-
ciprocate."Another advantage of stu
dent modeling is that each person
will be able to gain a new perspcc-
tive on his or lter own body as they
discover how others express their
visual impressions of their naked

form through art.

Many people probably wonder if
the people in the Life Drawing
course feel comfortable with posing
naked as a model for the other meme
bers of the group. However. none of
the students appear to mind, As Jen
Collins explained. “It’s not voyeuris—
tic or anything. At first it sounds like
it would be scary, but its not. because
at one point we're all naked." Stu-
dents said that they believe nude
modeling provides an intimacy
within the group unachievable in the
classroom, “We trust each other
enough to pose nude" related Laura
Lyndgaard.

While this ExCo class follows
Grlnnell's tradition of providing as
many opportunities as possible for
students to be naked iogetherin large
groups. it also provides a unique ex-
perience for individuals. with artis-
tic ability ranging from aspiring art—
ists to classroom doodlers, a chance
to participate in a very intimate ex-
change of artistic expression. Not
only do students share their bodies
With the group; they share their
thoughts and opinions. The class
members will critique each others'
work at various points in the semes-
ter in order to explain their artistic
decisions and offer advice and praise.
This will allow the group to learn
from the wide range ofartistic styles
and experiences of the individual
members of the class. The collective
accomplishments of the course will
be displayed in Bobs during the last
two weeks of class.

interest in things like vegetarian
Cooking and tilmrmaking as part of
their coursework.

Despite its apparent success,
Groppe and Osborn said that this
semester‘s ExCo is far from being the
formalized program they eventually
hope will develop. The two students
would like to be authorized to grant
one credit to ExCo students and two
credits to teachers. Groppe envisions
a course approval committee ﬁrst ap»
proving classes for credit The come
mittee would then evaluate teachers
while teachers would evaluate stu-
dents to ensure that classes were
completed satisfactorily. Groppe like
ened the accreditation of ExCo to the
recognition students have received
for music, physical education. and
interim classes, saying, “In all of
those activities Students have re
ceivcd credit forexpericntial, pattici-
patory course work that wasn't led
necessarily by professors"

In addition to simply increasing the
numbers of classes offered and stu-
dents participlttiug iii ExCo, Groppc
and Osborn said that they hope for
more community participation in ru-
turesessions. Ideally, prorcssors, rac-
ulty members. and townspeople will
be as involved its students in teaclie
ing, taking. and evaluating courses.
