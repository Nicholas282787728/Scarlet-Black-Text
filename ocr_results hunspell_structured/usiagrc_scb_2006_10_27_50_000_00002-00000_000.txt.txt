Drums of change

BY MICHELLE MANEMANN

Encouraged by the foreign tone and harmony of its music,
Sarah Parker '07 began iearnrng to play the African rnarirnba
at the age of l2. Until now, music has only been an extracurr
ricrriar sideline rot Parker, a Chemistry major and a member of
the percussion ensemble.

Ifher nomination for a Watson Fellowship is approved, rirar
will change. Parker’s proposal would have her study the impact
ofthc African marimba on culture in Botswana, South Africa
and Namibia.

These nations all lie near Zimbabwe, where the African
inaiimba was invented during the 1960s. Because ofU.S. travel
warnings, Parker could not travel to Zimbabwe,hut will instead
study rhc nrarimha in ncathy nations

Parker has boundless curiosity about her subject. “\Vhat is
the catch to [the inariiitlyal?" she asked. “Is it nationalis ? Is
it like sports or any other txtiacuniculni activity? What is its
role in Cllltufnc?

The rnarirnha was created to bridge social gaps hctuttn difr

change," said Parker.

Parker hopes to connect her experience with the melodies
and culture ofthc rnarimba to those oftlic people she wi ctr
counter. She is interested in the different ways the marimba is
incorporated throughout the African nations,

Being nominated is not a guarantee that Parker will icccivc
the fellowship, but ifseleeted, she said that she hoped to repre-
sent the other nominees who did not make it, “In some waysI
hated to go through the [selection] proccss,"Parker said. "There
are so many candidates and they can only pick four."

Christianity in prisons

Three times a week, Katie
Jarcs '07 gets into her ear and
visits the Newton Correction—
ul Facility Four yerrs ago, she
never expected that prison vole
untcer work would become her
callingior that she would be
nominated for 1 Watson Felr
lowship studying Chiistiaiiiry
in prisons.

Jares began visiting the M‘m‘mes
Newton correctional Facility NICKHECKER
three and a halfyears ago. “1 had never been inn prison, so I
knew nothing about prison p'olirics or programming," she said.
Despite her lack of experience, howevcr, Jarcs quickly became
interested in the prisons Christian evangelical program.

Jares currently teaches three different classes at Newton.
“Its an extra commitment, but I love it, ’said Jares. I found
this, and this is what I've ultimately decided I want to do with
my life."Shc currenriy works as co-Coordinator oftlie Grinneil
prison volunteer program.

Jarcs plans to rescarch prison systems in Zambia, Belize,
Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji and Northern Ireland. ‘Ive seen how
our system has dealt with this program, she said. Now I want
to see how it woiks in other places

While abroad, Jares plans to attend church services and
Bible studies to study the expression of thcology in a prison
setting, as well as observing whether prisoners contrnuc to par
ticipate in religious organizations once they are teleased.]arcs
also hopes to secure an internship with a correctional facility
funding agency.

I‘IEr main goal is to change attitudes about prisons. “\Ve
havc such prcconccivcd pigeonirolcs that we put criminals in,"
Jares said, “If we can find a more communal way to deal with
pullishmeilt,\ve can erase those crrtogorrcs.“
