One or the m .-t cnthusiastitall). re~
teivcd oi all numbers on this year's
lecture course was given in the Chapel
last night by Lal'ddo Tait. the noted
sculptor oi the Chicago Art institute.
who spolie instructively. artistically,
and humorously on the subiect, ”The
Sculptors Proiession." The house was
crowded almost to capacity to hear and
see this great American.

Popular Taste Is I’ll-aim,

The lecture has one ol the popular
liind. Although Mr, Tait has recently
risen to a position as one at Anlel .‘s
greatest sculptors he railed to divulge
many oi the deeper and woightier s
erets or his prot'ession. instead, mutll
to the satistattion oi his hearers. he
kept. them chuehling with
most oi the time,

He told of his worlr in Cllicago.7
iirst or "The Spirit ot' the Lilies.” now
in the South side parh sl stem or that
city. This heautiiully symbolin‘s the
Great Lahes. each oi the live hodies ot

tlows into the other, For this piece oi
work ilr. Tait won in out lame in
this country as an interpreter oi the
Middle West.

“The Spirit of the Lakes" was the
iirst or a series or pieces ior beaut
ing Chicago that Mr Tait is melting,
in his lecture last night he hrieily told
at this work, which will make the
Midway. the great avenue which calls
stitntes the main campus or Chicago
University. the greatest achievement
or civic beautiﬁcation ever undertalien
by an American.

In a nutshell the sculptor revealed
the aim or his profession. "The sculpr
tor‘s purpose underneath it all.“ he
sair. “is the desire to create something
heautiiul and something permanent.
What's the use or living unless we
can leave a heritage to those who come
behind? Lire hecomes ghastl , deadly,
meaningless unless we look at it in
this way."

One of the most inter ug parts at
the whole lecture was the orphiuation
of the sculptors methods. ‘The audi-
ence saw him mold on the stage a clay
dummy into a likeness or his as stint
and a clay model oi as young princess
into an elderly parsonage. \l'illi imprc
sinus of sunlrlsr. pleasure. horror. and
others in turn.

Near the end oi the lecture. which
began late on account oi the baslvcllmll
