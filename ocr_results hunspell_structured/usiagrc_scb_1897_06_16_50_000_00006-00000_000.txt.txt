COMMENCEMENT coxcenr.
The Commencement Concert
was awaited this year with more
than usual interest in that it was
to introduce to us an artist wllose
chosen instrument, the clarinet.
was practically unknown in solo

work in Grinnell.

Tlle intense heat of Monday
evening was responsible for many
vacant seats; still alargc and most
appreciative audience greeted
Mri Schreurs and those who as»
sisted him.

The ﬁrst notes from the clari-
net bespoke the artist. The
audience listened charmed
through the beautiful Scene and
Aria from “Luisa di Montfret."
only to break into licartyap
plausc at the close. The suc»
cecding three numbers in which
Mr. Scllreurs appearcd only scrv.
ed to increase tlle enthusiasm and
appreciation which the ﬁrst one
called forth The Larghetto from
Mozart's "Clarinet Quintet" with
its quiet perfect beauty, the
Weber "Rondo” in which the
artist displayed in the highest dc-
gree the possibilities of hisinstru-
ment and the ﬁnal “Fantasie” of
Bender showing the most brilliant
execution all served to form a
musical group which was an in-
spiration to the cagcr listeners.
No more thorough artist has ap.
peared in Grinnell than Mr.
Schreurs, and his rc-appcarancc
is much desired.

Mrs. Cole did ﬁne work in her
accompanying, a role which slle
always iills with perfectease.

Mr. Emery was welcomed in
two numbers, and his voice was
never more rich and sympathetic.
His Aria from "BenvenutoH is one
of his best renderings from the
French opera. The Schubert
numbers were equally pleasing
and "The Wanderer" is perfectly
adapted to Mr. Emery’s baritone.

Miss Rew in her concerto with
orchestra accompaniment nlade a
magniﬁcent appearance. None
of our musicians have a ﬁrmer
hold upon the heart strings of the
Grinncll people than has Miss
Rew,

The orchestra in the opening

“Hungarian March” and the clos»
ing Concerto did work which
made us proud for them to have
a hearing from an artist like Mr.
Schrellrs,

The evening was a success and
another debt of gratitude is due
to Professor Cole for the Com-
mencement concert of '97.

CLASS DAY cxenclsbs.

Thc class day exercises were
opened by a pleasing rendition of
“Way Down Upon the Swance
River" by the quartet consisting
of Messrs. Tcllier, Parish, Gray
and Russell.

Miss Gertrude Norris gave the
Salutatory. Subjecti‘ﬂhoiec.”
The dominating beliefs of the an-
cients. she maintained, were fatal-
isnl and pessimism. Thesc the
cries of life were not satisiactory
to thinking men. Man began to
realize that llc had himself an im-
portant part in the working out of
his destiny. Nolv the recognized
formula in all cases is, “either, or.”
Men canjustly call nothing trivial.
They must choose carefully in all
things As every man cirects the
weliarc oi humanity by llls own
life he must choose his lille of ac
tion so that thc greatest good shall
come to all. .

Paul Peck delivered the Class
Oration, “History's Harmonious
Progress.” No pcople is created
in vain. National ideals thus far
have been brought to light in bat
tle. Peace has triumphs no less
pronounced than war, Today
the triumphs oi progress stand out
as clearly as did the former ones
of war. We cannot tell the types
graphy of a country by the rela-
tive height oi its mountains.
Christianity and democracy have
had a greatel inﬂuence than the
combined lesults of battles, The
light or the grandest age the world
has ever seen is dawning upon us
#the age of character.

Following Mr. Peck, Mi I’Iarr
riet Case gave a characteristically
charming vocal solo, ”I cannot
help loving thee.” by C. Johns.

The Class Poem by Miss Helen
Bowen was a retrospect over the
four years of college life, and
sustained the reputation its allthor
has gained as one of Iowa Col-
leges most succcssiul vcrsiﬁcrs.

W. N. Temple delivered the
valedictory, His subject was l‘Thl:
Development or Individualism.”
l—lc sketched the progress oi gov-
ernment through the papal and
temporal regimes and recounted
the scenes of the French Revolur
lution. Flonl these he drew the
conclusion that God directs all
events toward some purposeiul
end. To his classmates he spoke
of their college icllowship devels
oped through iour years of lile
together.

J. L. Tcmplcman gave the Man~
tle Oration. He held that it was
the dutyofcvcry onetoencourage
and aid the cause of education in
every possible way The fate of
the nation depends upon this. The
highest ends of the state will be
realized only by a wise cO-operu-
tion on the part of the people.
Education in good citizenship has
been neglected. The result has

 

bccn political corruption. It is
duty of every educated man to
endeavor to correct this evil. ln
presenting the mantel to w. R.
Armstrong. as the representative
of the junior class, he said that
ancient custom always bears with
it something of awe. He endeav—
orcd to impress the new senior
class with the importance of their
position in the liie oi the college
and enjoined them to be faithful
to the trust placed upon them.
The program closed with a
musical number rendered by a
quintet, consisting of the ‘male
quartet mentioned above together
with Miss Case. The title of the
selection was “The Shallop."

ALUMNI REUNION.

The annual business me‘eting oi
the Alunlni Association was called
to order by Pres. A. W. Merrill of
the class of ’90. at 4 P. u. Tues-
day. Mrr N. F. Hawley. '79, of
Minneapolis, wasre-eleeted Alum-
ni Trustee for the term of three
years. Rev. B.St. John '76, oi
Des Moines. wasclected President
of the association for the coming
year; \Valter M. Parsons. '87. Vice-
I’lesident; Miss Nellie Perry, '85,
was re-elected Secretary, and Hi
Hi Robbins, 'og, Treasurer. As
member of the Athletic commit»
tee of the college W, G. Ray, '82,
was chosen. The report irom the
alumni member of the present
athletic committee was given by
E. L. Beald, '914 Following this
the question of the relation of the
alumni to the athletics of the
school was discussed quite iully
alld lreely.; The sentiment oi the
body was heartily favorable to the
college athletics but there was a
decided feeling that. while the
alumni were called upon ior their
full proportion of cash to support
the athletic interests ofthe school,
they were given no adequate
representation or voice in the
management of them. Looking
toward remedying this a commit-
tee was appointed to examine the
various systems of alumni control
ill the eastern universities, and re-
port at the next annual meeting,
There is a desire also on the part
of some of the alumni to see the
ﬁnancial management oi the Ath-
letic Union placed on a permanent
basis and not constantly changing
hands as it is now. No action
could have a more beneﬁcial ef~
fect upon our college athletics
than tlle successful operation of
these suggestions The meeting
was adjourned at 6 o‘clock so that
the members might attend the
banqueL

The alllmni banquet was held
in the basement of the Methodist
Episcopal churcll at six o’clock
Tuesday. Aitcrauelegantrepast
a number oi toasts were respond-
cd to, the banquet being pro-

 

nounced one of the best and most
enjoyable ever held.

Adjournment was then taken to
the auditorium where Rev. Mahc
lon Willctt, of Decorah, an alum-
nus of '69, spoke on the “Una
sounded Glories of the Common-
place." The address was replete
with good things and was heard
with greatest attention.

The theme was the utility oi
commonplaces and the recogni-
tion oi this utility by men oi
genius Scholarly research and
breadth were manifested through»
out. and the address was one of
the features of the week.

FROMENADE. ,

Of all the commencement fes~
tivitics this year the promenade
last evening is admitted by all to
have been the best idea, the most
pleasingly carried out. '

About 9:30 the Glee Club, sta-
tioned on the steps of Blair Hall,
began to sing the college songs
with which they have so many
times this year delighted large
audiences in the more important
cities of this part of the state.

The night was perfect and the
club was at its best, The thought
that this Was the last time they
would sing together this year and
that next year many old members‘
would be gone only increased the
zeal with which they sang the
praises of old I. C.

For an hour and a half the
familiar walls echoed with the
rollicking songs whlle a large
crowd, reclining on the grassy
slope in front or strolling along
the paths, listened in silence till
the last note died away, and then
broke out in loud applause.

When the last song was finished
the crowd broke up and many
were heard to express the desire
that this might become a perma
nent custom at the Grinnell com—
mencements.

opened with a selection by the
