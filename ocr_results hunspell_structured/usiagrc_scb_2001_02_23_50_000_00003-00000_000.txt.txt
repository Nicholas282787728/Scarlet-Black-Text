Judaism in Africa

by Sarah Liebman
Staff Writer

lay Sand, a ,ournalisr from Hurrrisburg, PA, spoke to Grinnell
students about his travels in African Jewish communities in a narrated
slide preenrrrion sponsored by chalui-rim, the Jewish student group
on campus.

Sand first learned ofAfriean chs from a friend whostudied abroad
in Kenya. The friend atrendod asynagogue in Nairobi [hntwas usually
attended by white people who are not from Kenya. but one nighr a
tall black man attended wearing local clothes and with an East African
accent. He knew the pnyeis. When Sand’s friend spoke to him later,
he said he was from the Ugandan Jewish community, Sand's friend
was skeptical but accepted rhe man's invitation to join the community
for rhe Jewish holiday of Passover.

What he encountered turned around every idea he had about what
ir meant to be Jewish. The ugrndrn Jews had minimal contact with
orirer Jews and thus rhey crested rheir own unique interpretations of
Jewish pricrice. sind’s friend asked him to make o rape ofAmericsn
Jewish music for the Ugandan Jews. using what lied learned growing
up as a songcleader with the youth group ofhis Hattisburg, Pennsylvo.
his conservative synagogue, he made rhem a rape. A few years ugo, he
decided to visit the Jew: onganda and the three othetAfrican Jewish
communities. When he arrived he found they had learned the songs
just as he had sung rhem on rhe rape.

According ro sand, rhe eonceprion ofJews as Whire people is rela-
tively recenr. Judaism was born on the landcbtidge between Africa and
Asia. It was common for people to travel between the two continents
and the traveling could rake long enough to adopt local customs dong
rhe way. Thus, there was a lor of mbring between Jews and Africans.

The community Sand’s friend, and later Sand, visited was 2Jso the
only community that does not claim ancient lsraelire heritage. The
Ugandan community, called the Abayudayah, number about SOOfI'heir
original leader semei Kakanguiu, an elephant hunrcr, collaborated with
the British to establish British iule in Uganda and converted to Chris-
tianity so years ago. He found rhat Christianity did nor appeal ro him
and preferred the harvest holidays ofthe old testament. in return for
his ossisonte he hoped the British would grant him a kingdom. When
they refused, he became angry. He was curious about Judaism and saw
no reason to continue pncticing the religion ofrhe British so he and
his community beams Jewish following only the Old resramenr in
the bibles the missionaries gave them. They developed their Judaism
based on home customs, the bible and music. Under the dictator
ldiamin, they underwent forced conversions, some ofthem continu-
ing to pmcrice in secret. Today the community flourishes. with finan-
cial assisrance from orher Jews they have builr synagogues, a Jewish
school and a communiry oenrer.

Sand also visited three other African Jewish communities. TheJews
ofchuna believe rhor they practiced Jewish customs induding dietary
laws, the Sabbath and circumcision before Christian missionaries came
to Ghana. Sand believes dial these Jews’ ancestors came to Ghana from
Timbuktu, a major trading city in Mali in 1500 AD. Therewere many
merchants from all over the world in Timbuktu and some of the Jew-
ish merchants probably found their “aiy ro Chane. Now. since books
arrived from Jews in the Wesr, the community holds nightly study
sessions. They also hove on active choir

In South Africa and parts onimbabwe, the Lemba form a distinct
cultural group. They speak differenr languages and have a variety of
occuparions, but they share Jewish cusroms such as dietary laws and a
preoccupation wirh cleanliness. They praeriee harvest holidays and Cir-
cumcision Their lmdluons teach that rhey were ancicnr Jews who
came from rhe North. Recently a geneticist isolated a sequence found
only in thc Jewish population The sequence occurs only in those who
believe they are descended from the high priest of biblical times. The
lemba have the same percentage ofthis gene as the rest ofthe Jewish
population. This evidence supports their claim, They are a highly Se»
crerive group as they foughr rhe British to maintain their culture. During
apartheid they applied for and received a cultural distinction. interest»
ingly, while Lemba will only marry oriier Lemba. rhcydo not consider
beingJewish a religion but rather aculture. For them it is not a contn»
diction ro praeriee another religion, and few are inrcrested in learning
about Judaism.

In another part onimbabwe, rhe people follow rhe teachings ofa
former American slave who became a Baptist minister, Reverend
Ctowdy. crowdy believed rhar his ancestors had been Jewish and sent
missionaries ro rell the people rhcy were JewishTherewas a church in
Zimbabwe that had been unsatisfied with Christianity and decided to
try Judaism. They believed that they had been practicing Jewish tmdi»
tions fora long time before Crowdy‘s missionaries came, The shona, as
they call themselves, include many southern baptist customs in their
proetieo. 1n addirion, their rabbi is a former Rascafurian. They are pres
pherie Jews and thus rhey believe that contemporary people such as
Crowdy urc prophets. The British opposed theit Judaism; therefore
they lived as hidden Jews until Zimbabwe gained independence, The
synagogue has been well attended and they are remodeling to accom-
modate hrger crowds.

Sand found that his travels showed him the great diversity ofJuda»
ism. But he also noted the commonality he felt he shared with Afriun
Jews, The children there were learning the same biblical life lessons
from the same stories he had learned in Hebrew school in Pennsylva-
nia. In addition, he feels freer in his Judaism since returning. “I feel
more comfortable being Jewish after ﬁnding our that there are so many
diifcrcnr ways ofbeing Jewish. i feel more comfortable doing what I
feel is righr us a Jew. I (in do my own rhing," said Sand.

Beyond alphabet soup

Students, trustees, and labor supervision organizations: a forest-level view

news analysis by Erik

Staff Writer

“[Grinnell College] is not a social
yustice institution, it is an institution
of higher education,"

Those words, spoken last week by
trustee Andrew Loewi ’7l, rubbed Stu»
dcnr activists the wrong way and raised
two questions abour the ongoing swear.

question ofwhich factory moniroring

Founded in rhe nineteenth century
by abolitionists, Gtiniiell has always
been a haven for progressives. Loewr
himsel if is no stranger to political ac—
rion. he served as president ofSGA

States invaded Cambodia and National
Guardsmen killed four student proteste
ors at Kent stare University in Ohio.

The college cancelled classes early
that year, bur a large group ofstudents
rhoughr “the college should remain
open and conrinue to engage in politi-
cal action" againsr the war in Vietnam.
Loewi was persuaded ro abandon the
proposal when “senior members ofthe
faculty evenrually convinced me and
the other student leaders that it would
damage rhe insrirurion."

Perhaps remembering the experi-
ence ofthelate19605 and early 1970s,
Loewi balk: at the idea ofinvolving the
college directly in poliries. "Where do
you end?" he asked. “Once you start

down that slippery slope, why don’t we
take a stand on all sorts ofpolitical is-
sues that a majority of rhc campus or
any given time might feel srrongly
about?

Paul Ford '02, s srudcnr activist
leader, rejects such rhinking, poinring
our that crinncll cngugcs in political
acrion all the time, “Grinnell rskcs a

campus," and on racial equality

that Grinnell rakes."

“Andy Loewi says Grinnell College

Concerned by the possibility ofhirrher declines in

from some fuculry over a complex application process.
GrinncllCollege's board ofrrusreegredirected profits from
endowmenr growth from the three-yeatcold Fund for or:

and the college’s Executive Council, members of those

bodies said,

will now be supplemented by a small portion ofrhc en-
dowment revenues that would otherwise have been car-

marked as FFE,

Osgood said he expected trustees re use the capiral
reserve fund to assist in the eonsrrucrion ofnew or reno-
vation ofold buildings, in accordance with provisions of

the campus master plan.

The fund had been composed ofsurplus endowment
