Most oi the college community takes a
true respite ironi the campus during the
summer months * whether in the form of
travel. employment, or study elsewhere.
Among those that remain in the Grinnell
community tor their breaks are 10-15
chemistry students collaborating with pro-
iessors on various research projects

"The academic year is largely devoted
to teaching." said chemistry Department
Chairman Elliott uhlcnhopp. "but alter
graduation. our research programs get in-
to full 5“ng "

Professor uhleiihopp's proposed Sums
nier research involves extensive
viscnelastometry Grinnell's chemistry
department boasts two or the country‘s six
Viscoelastonieters, which are used to
measure the molecular weights oi certain
DNA. as well as to monitor the rate of DNA
repair in selected unicellular organisms.

in the area oi molecular weight
measurements, a University 01 lowa post-
doctoral researcher is sending samples oi
chromosomes irom unicellular parasites
known as trypauosoines to Grinnell ior
weighing. Trypanosonies cause African
sleeping sickness in humans and cattle.
and the researchers hope to “make genetic
conclusions about the behavior of these
organisms" irom the results.

According to Uhlenhopp. niuch oi the
summer will be spent studying
teirahymena. "unicellular organisms
which are incredibly resistant to X-rays "

The Grinnell chemistry department is
acquiring a new [BM nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer which will aid and
direct much iuture research. According to
chemistry‘ proiessor Martin Mlnelli. iun-
ding tor the 3220.000 instrument was fun
nished by grants ironi NSF and a private
foundation.

Prolessor Minelli, who is in his first year
at Grinnell. says that the spectrometer

of molybdenum tMol chemistry at the Un-
