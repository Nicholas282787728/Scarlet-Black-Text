ONE BOARD TO CONTROL.

Alter a thorough investigation
of the needs of the various state
institutions. a committee from the
legislature has made a report in
which they maintain that these
institutions can be more properly
cared for under the management
of one board composed of three
or ﬁve members. The reasons for
this change are that the ﬁnances
appropriated tor these institutions
can be expended more judiciously
by one board than they can by
three. They will be in a position
to know the needs of each school,
and in what. way the moneyshould
be used, thus cutting down ex-

Under the present system there
seems to be aconstant struggle
between the various boards for
money from the state and at every
session of the legislature there is
a great scramble for funds; the re»
sult is‘that the school having the
biggest pull gets the most money.
This causes hard feelings and
each school accuses the other of
greediness and undue expendie
ture of its tunds. Only recent-

state schools were cut down and
most cases they received
much less money than asked (or.
