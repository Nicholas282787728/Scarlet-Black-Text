Die-in thank you

Dear Grinnell Community
We would llk: to rhanit everyone who supported and partiei.
pared in Wednesdays Die In, and all orrhe day's anti war activities.
We received a lot of media coverage, enabling our message to be
heard across the state. We realize that there are questions and con.
cerns surrounding the event. We invite everyone to rails to us, and to
each other about the current political situation, and what we can do
about it. We are glad that the Discln sparked such strong rcacliom.
We hope that these reactions will lead to productive dialogue, activ—
ity, .rnd awareness.

Clearing up the
misunderstanding

I would like to clear up a misunderstanding that has been re.
porred twice now in die my, including the Feb 28 edition, The
AnrrWar Alliance did not grorv our ofrhe Radical students Collee.
rive While this my seem a miner distinction ofhisrorical accuracy,
in a sense, it means something larger to the organizlrion. The Anti.
War Alliance does not claim or strive to be politically radical In fact,
the grerrp has made a great effort to appeal to a broad audience. I can
only hope that our broad attempt at outreach is evident ln some of
our sponsored programs such as the student initiative, eur campargns
to contact Congress, and an upcoming event on March 12, co.spori.
sored by the campus Republicans and Democrats, bringing veterans
to spealr on campus. The AntrWar Alliance is ,usr a small par r orrhe
woiId-widc anti—war movement that is far from radical,

I win now try to briefly account for the origins orrhe Anti.War
Alliance, As the sdbaccnrarcly reported, the group formed in octo.
ber ofzooz. around the time orrhe congressional debate on Iraq.
The emails that gathered the original dozen or so group members
were not sent through the Radied student Collective, Ar me first
meeting, the main decision to be made was whether or norwe thought
it necessary to form a new group on campus to oppose the possible
ivai rn llaq, Obviornly, we thought ir necessary lmpiicirrn rhardeci.
sion win an acknowledgment that the Radical student Collective
was not serving a need we saw on campus, What was needed was a
group dedicared to the issue of Iraq (our notcs‘ocspcclﬁc name, n
noted in the article, came later) that made it clear to the campus that
we intended to apped to a broad variety of people. Today, five months
later, I hope that the group has succeeded in fulﬁlling its original

purpose and proved that eppesuion to war in Iraq is not radical.

Don’t he s enced
by new policy

Dear Fellow orinneliians,

We are wining to express our concern with the College's new
policy concerning the dying of flag- as outlined in ha is $878,
The policy seems to be designed to silence a specific rorm ofpolrri.

The soundtrack of the season

Ah, the Sounds of winter: squirrels chatting in the
trees, the hum of Fat Man’s cute snow-plow tractors,
and the deep gargling of phlegm being hacked through
the throat of the kid sitting next to you. Yeah, that’s
me, one ofthe many. I have had it up to my plugged-up
ears with this bug. While studying in Hurling one evening
I used half a roll of toilet paper and bothered all of the
people around me with my incessant bugling. Afterl
was done blowing out what seemed like 12 ounces of
snot, I apologized to a student at a nearsby (able. She
Said, "It’s the soundtrack of Grinnell recently. That and
[cough, cough]i” And really, who can take a few days
off to recuperate? We're doomed to listen to the nasty
songs of the unhealthy until it kills us all.

the College’s orr.stared commitments to social justice, diversity, and
open political dialogue. in addition, the College seems content to
pass the policy into actuality by frat alone; other than going before
the Committee on student Life and voting on whether the policy
should be adopted, some Administrators are prepared to simply in»
serr it into the student

them, this Friday morn-

reminder re students orrhe precarious position that we ﬁnd our po-
litical liberties In this turbulent time. We anticipate that some sru.
dents may wish re hang the ﬂags from their windows, but we would
recommend agarnsehanging th: flags from windows, since this would
clearly contravene the administration's policy. And we certainly don’t
want that.

Allow for student
expression

1' rust read the recent article in the son about the new 0a gpolicy,
I strongly urge the administration to reconsider the policy to disal.
low students to hang flags outside of the dorm room windows, At
the heart ofrhe ruarrer about the ﬂag is not at all the issue or non-
proﬁt status, it is about rreedom of expression

The adminrsriarion orrhis college does not want its students to
actively express themselves. The ﬂags clearly fall under the jurisdic-
tion ofselfcgovemnncc. I sincerely doubt that anyone from this cam.
pus or visiting this oampru would say that die flags posred by sru.
denrs are ”a message of the college "The flags are messages from the
students and they often contradict the view ofthe administration. If
the college were re officially
condone my type ornag it

Know your enemy

Dear Editor,

in response to die recent review "Getting your groceries: Find
out where the quleeSI, cheapest, and best planes are in Grinncll to
stocis up on your party food essentials," I noticed some hostility to.
wards Hyrvge drat seemed to be based on the purchase ordre loral
pharmacy.

While I respect your opinion, I urge you re reconsider your posi-
tion. it is true that Hy.vee expects to gain from this business transac.
tion but the main idea is to gain ground on the real enemy ordown.
town local businesses,
Wald/tart.

Taicea minure ifyou
will and checkout

and you will see who is
swallowing the life outer
many small town Main
street businesses today.

It is imperative to
build an arsenal of cus»
romer services to defend
against the big box Walr
Mart and provide the one thing you won't find at Wallyrwarld.
GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Sam Wairon starred this monster in small towns around
benronviile. Ark. and trained his associates to build so many stores in
an urban area that all the smaller stores unnol survive. And you mn
imagine what his stores do in a small town where the owner is pricing
his goods just enough to malre ends meet.

Cunningham's was happy to sell re Hy.vee. They probably were
feeling a ior of hear from the recently opened Wzchzrt supercenrer
in Newton or the location in Marshallrown.

So before you raise stabs at the lowa based, employee owned,
profit sharing, community supporring Hera, raise a look at what
WalrMart is doing to your locally owned businesses in crinnell and
other lowan small towns. Perhaps you can do a feature on WdMarr’s
enter on Main street business complete with interviews ofrhe busi»
ness owners. Thank you for your time.
