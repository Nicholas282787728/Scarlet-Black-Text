Kyvig: Plans to continue work

of present SGA cabinet

continued from page I

My plan for next year includes
sustaining theprogressthatdtisyear’s
cabinethasinitiated,namelycontinu-
ing SGA’s commiunent to the Cof-
feehouse. This project has the poten
tial to change the face oIGrinnell, and
it is key that SGA continues to play a
role in its maintenance. Ialso want. to
furtherpursue some issues which have
come up this year; reaching a com
promise between sports clubs and
varsity teams forPEC practice space:
insuring students the right to schedr
ule social events on Wednesday
nights: and finding a workable loca-
tion for the SPARC administrative
ofﬁces.

Finally. I have an idea which] will
present to Student Affairs. It seems
that with the resources that this col~

lege has at its disposal that Student
Affairs should have an on-stalf pro-
fessional counselor with whom stu—
dents can make appointments. In the
past, students going through emo-
tional trauma have either been
shufﬂed off to the Mental Health
Center or neglected altogether. This
counselor would offer an option to
thosewhodon'tfeclcomfortabledeal-
ing directly with the deans in Student
Affairs. with the staff at the Mental
Health Center or with their Resident
Advrsor. i think that this is especially
crucial during a year which has ale
ready proven to be more stressful
than many. Grinnell College has a
responsibility toward its students that
we are not having fulfilled, and I
would do my best to see that our
needs are met.

president in 1992793317 This campus
needs someone with handson expe-
rience combined with dedication to
the position and the ambition to ex-
pand into new areas. I am proud to be
a member of an SGA cabinet which
has accomplished so much in trying
to build a true sense of community at
Grinnell, through the Coffeehouse,
Spring Carnival, and the Hall Coun-
cil Committee. We have challenged
both the student body and the admin-
istration, and we have succeeded in
pushingthrough someambitiouspro-
posals. I am the person to go above
and beyond this year‘s successes. I
am the person you need for SGA
President.

If you like what] stand for, come
stand beside me. Vote KYVIG for
SGA President on March 4.

As a senator this year, I am acutely

like the student government associa

dent participation and input. To do
this, I would write a column in the

One of the biggestresponsibilities
of the SGA President is to be the
students‘ representative to the Ad-

As SGA President, 1 would stand

During the election, I will not use
any gimmicks to obtain votes. I will

I thank you and ask for your vote

DICK:SGA needs change

almost like the administration. the
"other" people, the "esmblishment."
We need toeducate the population on
campus about how SGA works, and
get them involved in SGA. We need
to get SGA to the point where the

students can trust it They'll come to
it and they’ll let SGA help them If

they have a problem, or if they want
to do something. Guide them in the
right direction, maybe tell them who
they could go see. I think that is the
biggest thing.

One last thing thatl think I would
rovide that SGA lacks is the idea

that you need to work with everyone
on the campus. I think in the past
there has been a feeling that SGA
either solves all the problems by it-
self, or works with the administra-
tion. I think one thing they‘ve been
missing is working with the student
groups. Wejust added theposition of
Student Group Liasion this year, and
I think that could be used to pull in
students, not only for student input,
but also to solve student problems.
SGA should be more ofa true liasion
between the students and the admin-
istration.
