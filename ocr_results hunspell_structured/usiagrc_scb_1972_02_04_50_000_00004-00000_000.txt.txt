Hockey Club
Plans Games

The Grinnell Ice Hockey Club is
ﬁnally on the move. After a some
what slow start, it now appears
that the team may be playing some
games against other teams, probab-
ly in the Des Moines Ice Arena

it is pretty diitictilt to play any
sort of hockey on Bat-bar Plaza
(due to the small size), and many
of Grinnell's players are anxious
to play on a larger rink. It appears
that a game or two with Drake Uni-
versity during this season is a
deﬁnite possibility.

The hockey Club practices every
Tuesday and Thursday evenings
lrom 8:30 to 10:00 PM. There are
currently 16 players on the roster,
not all of them Grinnell College
students Because it is a club pro»
gram, and not an intercollegiate
sport, some players irom the town
are also on the duo Besides the
Tuesday and Thursday practices,
the Club has held intrasquad scrim—
mages on each of the last two week-
ends. Last Sunday, the team divided
into two liverman squads and held a
black and white-jerseyed scrim,
mage. with Mike Levy, from Los
Angeles, in goal, the teams played
a sort 0i halirice hockey.

Key prospects on the team who
have had previous hockey experience
are John Onstad (Fargo, no), Al
Frey (Saxton’s River, Vt.), Jim
Faultz, Dave Flaten, and Wes Tyler
(all from Crinnell), Jim Pirolli,
John Hessburg, Joe Generaux, Paul
Leitch, Mitch Erickson, Jeil nick,
Steve Lanick,andoalie Mike Levv

The Scarlet and Black

Maimen Pinned

At their second home meet on

Tuesday night, the Grlltnellwrestr
lers were deteated by the Rams oi
Cornell. As Mr Hunt, tormer
wrestling coach, said, “It was no
Surprise that Grinnell lost to Cor-
nell because Cornell has dominated
conference wrestling for over thirty
years.” Starting with three for-felts
and great inexperience, it seemed
logical that Cornell Could easily
Overcome the Pioneers. The Corr
nell teanl excelled in both wrestling
expertise and raw power and racked
up a score of 50 lo 3.

Unlike the previous matches, the
ardent Grinnell ions definitely had
something to cheer about. Bob
Donelan, wrestling at 158 pounds,
deieated his poweriul Cornell oppo»
nent by a score of 10 to 4. To say
the least the ians were ecstatic as
Bob controlled the match and came
very close to pinning the lighting
Cornelllan. OI the first three meets
of the season, this was the only
individual match victory ioraGrlnr
nell matman Hats oil to Bob,

The rest of the match was easily
dominated by the lighting men of
Cornell, At the 118 pound division,
Rick Nightingale tought a truly pows
erlul llx pounder. Rick had to tight
and scramble to avoid getting pinned
by his potent opponent, Then came
Rick Jelinek's bout at 134 pounds.
Rick encountered a very skilllul
Cornell wrestler whose savvy over-
came Rick's determination, and Rick
was pinned. At iSD pounds Jack
Couch lound nimseli in the ring with
an overly muscular beast. Jack not
only escaped with his life, he also
averted the pin. Then Came Bob
Donelan’s previously mentioned
heroism at 158 pounds.

The last two matches pitted our
novice Grinnell hattlers against two
Gargantuan Cornell matmelt. The
191 pound and heavy—weight Cornell
grapplers put on an exemplary dis-
play oi wrestling. Unfortunately John
Pursell and Lee Gleysteen were the
victims of their skillful show. Both
Grinnellians got pinned and seemed
lucky that the outcome was no worse.

Although Grinnell was deieated, we
weren’t shutout, which is at least it
moral it not an actual victory.

Swimmers Take Three

Grinnell swimmers swept alriple-
dual meet at Beloit last Friday evens
ing, a victory made especially sweet
by a measure at revenge on Ripon,
last year’s Midwest Conterence
champions, The meet, scored as
three separate dual meets, round
Grinnell on top in the scoring by
70-1/2 . 42-1/2 over Ripon, 74739
over Lawrence, and 98-12 over

Grinnell had the best times in an
impressive eight events. Freshman
Tom Rowat was the outstanding
Grinnell perlormer, winning the 200
yard Tree style, 200 butterfly, and
swimming a leg on Grinnell’s vic-
torious 400 medley relay. Mike

throned as conterence champs, but
it will be Carleton and Cornell as
the teams to beat. however, he did
admit that if his aquarjocks con-

a good shot at the title they won two
years ago. Alter duals against Knox

Pioneers Drop
Two On The Road

Grinnell’s varsity basketball team
took to the road last weekend, play-
ing consecutive engagements with
Monmouth and Knox, but with the
team’s strength sapped by continue
ing illness, the Pioneers succumbed
to deleat in both matches.

Monmouth ramped to an 87-52 win,
while Knox tallied a 97-69 triumph.
Coach Ray Boyd, in commenting on
the situation, said, “We got beat
pretty badly at both ball games, but
we left two good ball players at
home —- they were both sick, Physir
cally we’re not in very good shape.
Right now l’ve got one player with a
sprained ankle and three more sick
with the ﬂu.”

In examining the Statistics oi re~
cent games played and comparing
them With trends extendingthrougne
out the season, one notes that Grinr
nell’s scoring ability has sutlered as
a result ol'adrop in the team’s shoot-
ing percentage Coach Boyd hopes
that Bob Burnett, who will return to
the line-up this weekend, can alter,
at least in part, a solution to this
problem. In addition to Bob’s res
bounding ability, Boyd notes ‘
with Burnett being such a threat 1 —
side, they (opposition) sagged in on
Burnett and our guys got better
shots. ,Without Burnett they guard
our guys just so much more closely,
and consequently our shooting per-
centage has gnne down,"

Scheduled this weekend is a road
trip to Wisconsin, where the cagers
will meet with Lawrence tonight,
iollowed by a contest at Ripon on
Saturday. The team appears to be
pulling itseli together, and although
Boyd concedes that “Ripon is going
to be tough, they’re a very good ball
club...”, there is a good chance that
Grinnell may emerge victorious
