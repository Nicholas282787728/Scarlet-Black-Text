in a hard fought, closely contested
game, Cornell defeated Grinneil with
a score of 6—0,

The feature or the first half was the
rooting of the Crinnell supporters, the
determined united team work of tire
scarlet and black and the success with
which they used the forward pass.

wood were the mainstay of Grinnell's
offense. The chief weakness of the
Grinnell defense was their failure to
cope with the manner in which Cor-
nell handled the forward pass.

Before a crowd of eight hriiidred
people, three hundred of whom were
Grinneli supporters, Grinnell played a
desperate game against Cornell. Playl
ing as they had never played heiore
this season, the 'Grinncll offense fair-d
ly swept Cornell off their feet/during
the early part of the first half. Later

with line plays, Cornell advanced the
ball to Gi-irineli's 3 yard line, where
Grriiriell held and Hammond printed
out of danger. At this point Cornell

line plays carried Gl‘lnneil back to

First Half.

Grinnell chose the east goal and

the first kick the ball went out of
bounds and was brought back for an.
other attempt. The second kick wont

yards. This placed it on Gl‘inncll’s 25
yard line. On an interchange of punts

half. Repeatedly he sent his long
spirals for fifty and sixty yards, i-lani-

brought one or two things to Griniicll

This tail for the first time since the
iresliman ineligibility rule has been in

.iorce in Grinnell College, the Fresh-

men have had it team out on Ward
Field every night. The Freshmen do
not have the interest of the whole col.
iegc behind them, they do not have any
one behind them but their own spirit
and the coach. They are the material
that the college team practice with.

But this ingenious service is not to
he the ultimate end of the Freshman
team. The men who can show that
they have ability to play as Freshmen
are the men who will one day he the
mainstay of the college Learn, they are
the men who will one do ~ be the teams

Captain Sherman, Raymond Fleck,
Robert Hendrixson, Frank Fm’dyce.
Watson, Vilaii Eagan, Leon Brady and
a number of others have all shown
good football ability which with more
experience and with the training that
Coach Dougorty can give them, should
make them valuable additions to Grin.
pell's football teams in the next three
years.

The credit [or what the Freshmen
have done in football is due not
entirely to their own efforts hilt to the
able assistance and training they have
received from Marshall since he was
declared ineligible for the college team

.cnrly in the season.

Griliileil has just closed one of the
unsuccessful football seasons of her
history. Three defeats, a tie game and
a victory over Des Moines College is
Grinnell's record thus iar this season,
hrit two of the defeats were at the
hands of Amos and Drake while the
other defeat w by the exceptionally
strong team at Simpson. Grinnell
played one a scoreless game and de.
teated Dos Moiues College by a good
margin.

With five old men as a nucleus,
Coach Douglierly set about turning out
a~representativc team. Injuries have
kept the team disabled all season and
this together with a lack of material
has resulted in a continual change in
the lineup, Wells, Rowell end Tur.
ncr have been out of the game most of
the tear while Sparks, Shinstrorn and
Bears have been out of several of the
big games because of injuries. These
continual misfortunes have taken most
of the “pep” out of the team and not
until today has the team played the
game which it is capable oi playing.

The season started with the annual
practice game with East Des liloines
High, which resulted in a decisive vie-
toi-y for the collegialis bi a score of
