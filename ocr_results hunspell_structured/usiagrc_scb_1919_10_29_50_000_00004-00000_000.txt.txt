Be the Greatest American
Since Lincoln.

“The real greatness of Roosevelt is
fast, putting his errors into eclipse."
declared President Main at Chapel]
Monday morning.

“He is rapidly coming to be con-
sidered the greetest American since
Lincoln, We are just beginning to
get acquainted with his remarkable
breadth. The most characteristic
statement which can he made or him
and which was always before him as
a motto is 'A man's greatest happiness
is only to spend and to be spent.’ "

Inﬂuenced Alucriciili Art.
“We do not usually associate House

a great inﬂuence in American art. At
one time he had new coinage designs

erni millions or dollars in the new
design had been run off. The archi-
tect, McKim, was employed for the

President and the architect resulted
in it perfect achievement. His sense
of beauty was as great as his common
sense. The Fine Arts Council for
Washington, was appomted by Rooser
velt and it did much for the art of
America until it was discontinued by
Congress."
