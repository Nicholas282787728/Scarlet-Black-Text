on even terms throughout the first
half, the sophomore nve weakened
and allowed the frosh to win ’by a
score of _23 to 7. Tire victory for the
freshmen gives them the undisputed
championship. '

The prep team seemed a little um-
ous at the start of the game and failed
to function in their usual style. How-
eveh, they managed to lead at the end
of the hall hy.a s to 5 score. At the
surf of the second half, Duke looped
in a long one which started the preps
on a scoring rampage. Duke scored
two more baskets, Coggcshall three,
and Gray one during this half.

game by the score of 21 to 5. The

in danger of losing.

The juniors who were without the
services of ”Moco” Rincfort played in
a listless fashion and failed to put up
a strong dctcnse. Both teams were
ragged in their shooting and passing
and many easy shots were missed.
The seniors displayed some good
guarding and kept their opponents

"Be it resolved that we advocate to
the president and Senate of our coun—
try, adherence to the pcrrnanentCourt
oi international Justice under the so—
calicd Harding-Hughescoolidge res—
ervutions,” was the resolution passed
at the national College conference,
held at Princeton last Friday and
Saturday. ‘

Delegates from 250 colleges and
universities from all over the United
States were in nttehdnnce'at the col—
lege court conference, according to
word received from Frank Dewey'.
Grinnell representative, Who attended
the cohierence and is now on his way
home.

Argue Both Sides

Both sides of the world court ques-
tion were presented but the resolution
passed favoring United States en-
trance undcr administration terms
met with most iavor among thc col-
lcge students. The poll taken by the
New Student, disclosed 93,799 were in
favor of the court in terms acceptable
to the administration, 7,834 voted for
the strong reservations oi Senator
Burah and 13,940 Were against the
courL

Thc purpose on the conference was
to set down definitely the votes of
the colleges and universities on. the
court and to discuss allplrascs oien—
trnnce into the court, and to form a
permanent organization for the col-
lege youths of America.

Clarence narrow Speaks

Clarence Darrow. noted criminal
lawyer and Senator Lenroot of i the
foreign relations committee held a dc-
hate upon the court the first evening
of the conicrence. Lenroof uphold the
court while Darrow who substituted
for Hrookhart, who was unable to of)
pear as planned, presented the Raga.»
tivc arguments.

Dermot presented the familiar arg-
uments, namely; first, it provides a
means not now existent of settling in—
ternational disputes by interpretation
of law instead of by arbitratiou;gsec-
oud, the court is not dependent upon
me League of Nations; third, we can—
not be compelled to submit disputes
to the court nor to abide by its decis—
ions; furthermore we now have the
right to submit cases to the court and
the only change contemplated by the
Senate is the giving of our moral sup—
port to the practical attempt now be-
ing made to solve international dis—
putes, and the payment oi about $35,—
000 ayear as our share of the court’s
expenses.

Speaks For Brooklurrt .

Mr. Darrow who was in Princeton
on other business was asked to speak
on a days notice when it was found
that Brookhart would be unable to
leave Washington. He said that join-
ing a court which had so little auth-
ority did not appeal to him. It would
be like getting into a pot for $35,000
with the privilege of withdrawing if
we failed to draw a good band. He
said further that the court is a step
toward the League of Nations and
that many people who hope to see the
U. S, in the League are advocating
the court.

Various discussion groups met Sat-
urday morning. On Saturday after-
noon an open forum was held on the
question of the court and the conclus<
ion reached was embodied in the res-
olution: ‘ “Whereas, we the delegates
or these 250 institutions of higher
learning in the United States of Arn-
erica, desire to hasten the security of
peace in the world and for all peo-
ple; Be it resolved, that we advocate
to the President and the Senate of
our country, adherence to thc Perm»

under the so-callcd Hardingrl'lughes-
Coolidge reservations.

to his expectations there were many
good arguments presented against U.
