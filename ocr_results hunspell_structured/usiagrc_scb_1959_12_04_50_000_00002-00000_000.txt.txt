Public Losing In labor Disputes

Neither tlle representative for management nor the
representative for labor who spoke at the recent Merrill
discussion symposium was able to formulate a remedy to
the great wrong clone to the American public as a result
0! the labor-management disputes.

in a situation such as the steel sirllie, labor has the
u I ii to stand behind it and fight for its rights. Manage-
ment him its own capital and other resources from which
to draw.

The public has no such organ .
that regulation imposed by' the liedel' 1 government.

Yet it is the public, in its role as consumer, which'
makes the financial existence of both labor and manage-
ment possible.

We see the situation as this. Both labor and manage-
lllF'lii. must settle their problems with the iniel‘ests of the
pl slic in mind. They must not be blinded by their own
plule, ambition and principles.

Unless this is done. we see no alternative but .that the
federal government, ill the interest of the American public,
in given by that public the '_ hi. to act d ectly, quickly
c.1i’l with more power in the regulation of labor and male
agi-nlent.

Dissent Vilaﬁovrﬁirménl

This is not the age of hall" a decade ago that allowed
SHA» Joe McCarthy to parade about in his

government is not strong enough to safely allow criticizers

ignominious
We are wiser and more confident. Ir" a system of

0*? hat government to exist and speak freely then that
government’s right to continue needs to be seriously colic
sl cred. The right to (I out is in many “a l the stl'eng l
of our nation. If that right 0R opportunity is suppressed,
then ill fear we have denied our own best hopes.

But, wllat is the positive Function of dissenters in our
sr‘ciety‘.’ It seems that they have at least three major

functions. 'F‘i , they compare what is to what might be.
In this sense, they are the continually necessd 'v source of

To the Editor:

‘ Thc semester in Washington,

although its academic burden
for uclual courses IS inuch lcss
than at Gi-inncll, yields
valualle experiences and in-
Sights that can be obtained only
in Washington.

Through an individual rc-
‘ scrircli project and seminars
with government niiicinls and
persons in privntc activity,
i one comes to a better realiza-
tion and awareness or how
our government actually
works.

Thc American govcinnicninl
process, into which many indi-
vlduals and groups enter, is, as
ii see it. based upon the coli—

cepts of pluralism and relalwr“

.‘ism, ior although some people
lmuy cl im to hold to absolute
ltruihs or values. the process of
government or the art of com-
promise is a continual bal-
ancmg and rcbulancing of dis
Vergcnt and conflicting inicrcsis.

This is inciliinicd by ihc
vast number of “points of
ricc 55" to the decision-making

‘ processes. In the United
States today, an individual
i can chempt to inﬂuence the
l government's decisions by
, oting in elections, hy writ-
l ing to Cuncrcssmen and other
government oiiicinls mid by

Acid . and Base

by John

The womens government horc
‘15 well known to be an udniii
lablc and truly protestant in-

mm vcntlon ior increasing the powri

‘cr or the. popular and their fa-
:vcriics and rendering the popur

l And it is known well that
‘thc women's government is to
,ihc men’s wlial fanaticism is to
lsuperstitlon, or what delirium

speaking, what despotism is to
democracy; though
lisni is the mcicrnal (as in
mother) tyranny of the innioiu
ny, and the democracy, inc der
mocracy udiniiiislcred by sleepy
republicans ' '

Yet, when I questioned Miss
X him the Quad, she said.
concerning the government
there, “It is something indis-
pensable in this best or all
possible Quads,’ a necessary
ingredicni; lor ii 1 did nut
have so many mothers here to
instruct mid discipline me,
would go crazy irnin missing
my real one,“ as if it were
true that mothers do truly
know best, be they natural
or elected.
l i reminded her than that
lgirl, hiicr She is locked in a
lroom, is good for nothing, and
lthat punishments
the welfare of society should be
useful to its mcnibcrs or at
least, in the casc 01 the “Crim-

'sldcs cinbiiicrnicni“ If pu'blic
example of the right of society
to bring vcngcancc down on the

would certainly serve the AWS
