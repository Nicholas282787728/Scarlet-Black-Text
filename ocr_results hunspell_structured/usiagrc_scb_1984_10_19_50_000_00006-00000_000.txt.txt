Men’s cross country: hopping right along

Avslrullo

Such is the chant of the Purple
Kangaroos 7 probably more
familiar to most as the Men's
Cross Country team.

That kangaroos seemingly have
no relation whatsoever to running
doesn't matter. What counts are
the factors that spawned the
nickname,

At the top 01 the list. according
to Cocaptains John Abe-l and
Steve llarrold. is the spontaneity
of the team. which. on any given
day. can range ironi singing in
public as they run. hopping like
kangaroos in restaurants, and
running through shopping malls
aiter meets in big cities

The sidclong glances are all
taken in stride. After all, what are
a low stares ii such spontaneous
action can foster the unfailing
sense oi unity this team shares?
in describing this unity, Coach
Will Freeman observed. ”They
help each other out by drawing
irom each other and pulling ior
one another. lt's gratiiying to see
improvement." he continued.
“but the team unity is what really
makes it worthwhile."

As Junior Jim Rasmussen
noted. it‘s interesting to see so
much team unity in a sport as
individually-oriented as running.
Abel, in discussing this unique
bond. explained. “We sort oi go

led to the victory.

“Our young oiienslve line

Martinek also noted that.
though the team lacks depth at
each position. the players are
good athletes. and that is how they
are able to turn “enthusiasm and
determination" into an over-
powering Victory,

we can be honest enough to deal

Elaborating, he said, “We all

same experience."

The men may be at diiterent
emotion levels. but Freeman
believes they are “very close in
ability.” He stated. ”Our lop nine

Last weekend. at the Iowa

top five included Steve Piper

Wisdom (2815). Steve Preus
(28:16). and Harrold (28:18).
Freeman pointed out. “This is the
second week in a row that they’ve
really surprised me." ‘

Freeman detailed the source of
this surprise. sayng.“l expected
them to run belter at Beloit than
they did, and everyone had a poor
race; and last weekend i expected
some slower times and instead

Freeman 7 the meet was em-
phasized only as an extension oi

Freeman “fully expected them to

Commenting on the match.

lost by the close scores in several
matches reveals that we have the
ability, but we just could not pull
the matches out." She added.
“Cornell is a strong team. and we

The Central Invitation, schedul-
ed for this weekend, is not of ma
jor importance to the team right
now. Again. as Freeman notes.
“Training is our total concern.
This is our last week of intense
training beiore our target meet 7
conference."

Conference is the meet the team
set their sights on early in the
season as their ultimate goal. Two
other primary goals were to re-
main healthy throughout the
season and to improve with the
realization of these goals.
Freeman stated, "The season has
more than met my expectations.”

He remarked. “With one or two
exceptions. they are healthy and
running well. and in the cases of
the exceptions. those injuries
were sustained prior to the cross-
country Season." in terms oi the
team‘s improvement. he com-
mented, “For the most part.
everyone is improving 7 many of
them substantially so. The
amount of improvement in some
cases is both surprising and grati-
lying."

Particularly of note for substan-
tial drops in their times are Mike
McNamer. P.K. Klaiman, and
Nick McNamara.

On both team and individaul im-
provement. Rasmussen noted.
”As We go through the season we
get better and better about coping
with the race in both the physical
and mental respects." Again

According to Coach Evelyn
Freeman. Straight "had a par-
ticularly strong race considering
she was out ior part ol the season

starting to feel strong again."
Since this Weekend is the begin
ning of break. Freeman is making
the Central College Invitational
an optional meet for the women.

She has nine runners going tomor- '

row. The team placed third last
year. but Freeman has no idea
what the competition will be like
this time around.

Carty termed a “great weekend of

as Monmouth had no shots in the

“The game was pretty lopsided
