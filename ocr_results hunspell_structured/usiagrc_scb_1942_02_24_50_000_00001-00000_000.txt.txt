“The conditioning program is

of most of the men interviewed
by the Scarlet and Black in an
effort to discover what progress
had been made in the first three
weeks of exercises.

Gripes ranged from not enough
exercise to the lament of Bill
Ellerbrook. "I'm losing pounds
steadily; in about two more weeks
I'll be a minus weight."

Lane's Address

Praises Humble

“Blessed are the meek for they
shall inherit the earth.” was the
text chosen by Rev Dr. Stoddard
Lane, pastor of the Plymouth Coll—
grcgational Church in Des Moines.
Iowa, for his address in Herrick
Chapel this morning.

Because meckncss is so often
associated with such characters as
llir, Milquctoast, Dr. Lane states
that a better connotation of the
word would be genuine biiinility
as related to true strength of
character.

Dr, Leno believes that progress
grows from discontcnt. He gave
examples in three differcnt typcs
oz progress: scientific, personal.
and social. ’

John Miller, nibblo junior, wu-

and Claire Pattrson, smith
junior have all taken ii seat on
the political horizon.

Miller said that he definitely
planned to run, and he stated.
“I hope it's a non-political came

McKeon said, “I’m definitely in.

“When they coiiht up the hats
in the political ring they will find
my battered fedora resting
among them," Kaloupek said.

Patterson made no bones about
his intentions concerning the
presidency, when he stated, “I
want to take this opportunity to
notify the electorate that 1 am
available for the office. In other
words, I can be be He cone
tinued by presenting a platform
which he described as irresistable.
First of all, he stated that when
called to committee meetings with
President Stevens he would fold
his arms across his chest and
grunt, “All psychology will be
applied in vain." He added that
he was working on a plan where—
by the law of electro-magnetics
would be applied to student gov-
ernment. “All of Dr. Einstein's
more obscure theories will be put
into practical application. Atoms
will be smashed daily in sppropn'.

Men Withdraw.

The first of the proposed candi-
dates for the post to throw in the
towel was Jack Fiye. Smith
junior. Frye said, “though 1 am
not well known around the cams
pus, all my supporters are solidly
behind Patterson.”

Chuck Gee, Dibble junior, was
the next to rctiie from the battle
when he stated that he “bowed to
a superior chemist and would
throw his full support behind
Patterson."

Paul Bremickor, Gates junior,
was next to withdraw, and he
said. “I am backing Patterson
with all my two votes, one from
me and one from, well you knew
I'm almost going steady."

George Bishop, Smith junior,
when interviewed said he was
planning to go to summer school
and would be graduated from here
in the middle of the year. ”Also,
