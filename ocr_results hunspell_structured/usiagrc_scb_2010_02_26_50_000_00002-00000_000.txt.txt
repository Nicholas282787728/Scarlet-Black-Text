World Headlines

. According to news source Haaretz, the passport pho-
tographs of the agents responsible for assassinating
Mahmoud al-Mabhouh on Jan. 19 were altered so that
they could not be identified. Various inconspicuous fea:
tures were changed within the photographs—such as
eye color or a lip linhso that passport control would
not become suspicious. Dubai police still don't have vi-
able information regarding the appearances of the 25
agents involved in the assassination due to the fact that
only a few of the agents were recorded on the security
cameras without their disguises. Mabhouh’s death has
led to a number of recriminations between Hamas and
Israel, as well as between Fatah and Hamas. This past
Wednesday, the Dubai police announced that they had
identified 15 additional people involved in Mabhouh’s
killing, three ofwhom used forged Australian passports
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith added rhat
there is no evidence that the three Australians whose
names were used on the passports were involved in the
affair.

National Headlines

- The Wednesday, seaWorld whale trainer Dawn Bran-
Cheau died as a result of traumatic injuries after being at-
tacked by a killer whale. Homicide investigators said that
the killer whale, the largest male Orca killed Brancheau,
40, by dragging her from shallow waters to a deep pool,
it is unclear whether or not the Orca—Tilikumewas acts
ing violently or was merely playing. Eitperts say that large
mammals, such as 12,000 Tilikum, are treated differently
than other animals held in Captivity~such as Chimpan-
zees, alligators, pythons and pit bulls. This is because the
whales are essentially still wild, thus making it diFﬁqut to
classify the OrCa’s attack. However, Tilly doesn’t have a
clean record when it tomes to attacks. In 1991, he drowned
a trainer at an aquarium in Canada during a show. Later,
SeaWorld officials found the body ofa homeless man who
had snuck into Tilly's pool after the amusement park had
closed for the day. SeaWorld's head of animal training has
no plans to euthanize Tilly, stating that Orcas are a valuable
resource for as to learn from. Additionally, Tilly is the [a
ther of14 calves, making him one of the animal kingdom‘s
most valuable defendants.

Conner acknowledged that the cons
struction was happening at a time that was less than ideal for
students, and that FM had been informed to begin construc-
tion at a more reasonable time ofday.

“We have told FM to respect the students'schedules by not
doing anything noisy until 10 a.m., but I’m sorry to hear that
didn’t happen," Conner said. “[The whole event] wasn’t ideal
and I think we would all like to try this over again ifwe had
the chance. But when you're in a work relationship like this, we
simply accept their apology and move on."

Conner said that it is unlikely The new door will be utilized
for its cautionary purpose ofclosing the lounge due to smoke
ing.

“Ever since the patrols have been set up, we've had zero

reports of smoking from PM or security or residents. It’s really,
really great to know that our concerns that we might have to
shut down the lounge are not coming through," Conner said.
"So even though the door exists now, it’s just another entry
point. We have no intention ofloeking the lounge."

Students have also noticed the increase of compliance with
the Iowa Clean Air Act.

“It hasn’t been made clear that this was done so the ad
ministration could potentially close Cleveland lounge, due to
smoking," said Cole Unger '13, a resident of Cleveland Hall.
“From what I observe, people have been smoking a lot less [in
Cleveland]than last semester."

weckivc offer Resume Tips.

Customize your resume to the organization and posinon you're ap
plying for, There is no one tonect returns format, the most successful
resumes are representative oirhe person they describe and the position
dreyre intended for. Consider using a career objective that dcscribts
your career goals in clear and succinct terms directly beneath your con-,
tact information. Don't be afraid to experiment with formatting or how
you present your sitpcricnccs. Divide them into pertinent sections that
cover spectﬁc topics.

In your “Job Experience" section, create derailed bullets that de-
scribe your experience both quanciraovely and qualitatively through
active verbs and numbers. For example, instead om spent a large pore
tion ofiny timc analyzing reports,'write “Analyzed zss environmental
reports ranging from modern topics such as gcothennal technology to
historical topics like Sanborn Fire insurance Maps."

And lastly, make sure your contact information is up-ro-dare and
accurate! Underneath your name, list your street address, phone num-
ber, and email address for both your current and permanent residence
