Sorry Charlie

\ Signs angrily denouncing the dining services' choice to serve
Yellowtin Inna as Special Dirmer sprang up all ovcr campus last week. What are
the reasons for the ouuage? Was the anger justiﬁed?

The Scarlet a Black, white able to emphaihrze with the incensed
students, docs notteel lhatdlning services should be the objecrotuieir indignation.
They should look insread, to the disturbing fact that die runarrsh proved such a
popular item.

According to the AnimalRights Coaliu‘on initiative. ‘Tunaﬁsh and runa
recipes...shouldbeclearly labeledas boycotted...so rhatsmderns and visitors tothe
dining hull are made more aware ofnot—caught tuna." Th: runarrsh was clearly
marked as a boycott irem, and yct 90% of the entrees offoradithc number or
portions prepared being based on data from past Special Dinncrkwere eaten by
students. Perhaps those who favor a boycott on tuna needed 10 offer more
informarion as to why rhey havo adopted their postition.

The initiative referred to “neuing methods which are hamiful Io maring

More cxpli l infonnalion should have been provided. For example,
smdenrs might have shunned the tuna if they had realized |ha| 80% ot the Eastern
spinner (a species oldolphin) population has been destroyed since 1950 due to a
netting method which employs mile-long mesh nets in which traps dolphins.

These merhods are used mainly by foreign neers from Latin America,

Editor Criticizes Abortion Hostility

Too often, Grinncll students are
condemned for supporting issues
that are “politically correct." Crit-
ics argue that students Support the
particular issue solely because it
agrees with the majority of campus
beliefs. No credit is given to slu-
dcnts who consider an issue, weigh
both sides, and then choose which
stance to lake.

The recent entry in the Campus
Memo (Feb. 6) ‘ﬂnnouncing the
formation of a campus pro-life
organicationchosctocondemnproe
choicc activists, and, in doing so,
u-ivializcd an chrcmcly complex

issue. Regardless of onc’spersonal
beliefs conccming abortion, trivial-
izing pro-choice supporters by call~
ing them “bumper-sticker” ideo-
logues must be viewed as a cons
temptiblc action. ‘ ,
By using a hostile tone, the
wrltcr of the entry ignorcs those of
us who have seriously considcrcd
thc issuc. My personal views have
been affected by meeting sevcral
womcn, including rclativc, who
have underwent illcgztl abortion
procedures. Therefore, to be rce
fcr-rcdtoas someoncwithout‘nloml
or ethical principles in regard to the

‘convenience killing' of unbom
children"is insulting. My decision
to support reproductive rights was
notmadc because it was the popular
ideology of the day. >

Thcabortion issue is not one that
can be easily dismissed. Grinncll
needs a campus pro-lifc organiza—
tion to complement the already»
strong pro-choice voice. But dlﬁ'
logos and debate are needed. More
mindless hostility will not lead to a
solution. '

Focus on Real Issues: Eliminate Racism

I would be lying ifl said LhatI
was not frequently critical of much
of the social activism that take place
atGi-innell. Ihavcncverundetstood
the burning intensity of issues such
as, what is the politically concct
spclling of the word women
(Ymin??),orif|.haBCC will rtxzcivc
the rather dubious honor of having
a tombstone on their its lawn.

I have often questioned the
rationale that these actions are signs
of some lingering malignancy of
oppression, and that unless wc all
band together and confront these
‘vilzll’ issues, we will be consumed
by taco hatred. Italwztys seemed to
methutmountains werebcing made
out of molchills, and that many
Gnnncllians wcrc, for lackofa better
phrasc, liberals looking for an
injustice to crusade against. The
problem,howcvcr,isnotthclzickof
real issues at Grinncll, but is the
unwillingness to deal with the real

issues that confront us.

There is, without a doubt, race
hatrodatGrinncll. Wc allhavesccn
signs of this hatred, which cannot
go unnoticed. One merely has to
road the walls of thc Burling
bathrooms to soc what is on Lil least
some pooplcs’ minds. While many
people might dismiss such l-litlcritc
verses as “why are there so many
Jews and ‘homos’ at Grinncll? is
thcrcaconnection?”orlhcdiatribes
against African~Amcricans, Jews,
Arabs, homosexuals, as wcll as
almost every other minority, I, in
good conscience, cannot. I am not
ashamed to admit that I ascribe a
certain amount of paranoia to
Burling‘s anonymous walls, as I
wonder who arc thc people who
writc with such venom. But more
then pamnoid,thosc walls make mo

ANGRY, Not just at the people
who wrote those less than inspiring
verses,butlackthccouragetospcak
their mind. but equally so at the so-
called libcrals who ignore the signs
of such hatred, prcl'crrin g toconfront
problcms with easier answers and
more tangible enemies.

Almost everyone at Grinncll has
at some point read what is written
on those walls, and yet we still
arguc the seemingly picayune
details of spelling and tombstones,
rather then the real hatred lhatexists
in our community, All of us, it
seems have chosen to ignore the
obvious in favor of the minisculc,
the marginally important, the
laughable. It seems we are like the
blindman feeling overlhcclcphant,
failing to identity it for what it is.
Except, unlike that famed clichc’,
