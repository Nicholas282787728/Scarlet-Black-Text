‘A STEP BACKWARD ’7

(An Editorial)

distasteful task of announcing that the man, thought to be best
qualified to succeed him, and who was duly elected, will not be per-
mitted to hold the office

For both professional and personal reasons, to be forced to make
such an announcement in one's final edition is highly distasteful, and
even more so when the circumstances under which the incident has
arisen are such as in the present case.

Mr. Corlctt, who was unanimously elected as the best qualified
man for the editorship of the paper, has been ousted through efforts
of the Curriculum committee, and for reasons and under circumstances
which are unusual to say the least,

He was ruled ineligible to hold the position liccausc he is not a
fully registered student, carrying a minimum of 12 hours,
matters may have entered into the problem, such as past scholastic
records and personal foclings of people hostile to the Scarlet and
Black, but nevertheless the legal aspect is that he is technically in-
eligible.

However, it seems to me that the action of tlic Curriculum com-
mittee was governed entirely too much by purely technical and legal
aspects and gave scant consideration to numerous other factors which
have complicated this situation

Personally, I want to take this opportunity for thanking Mr.
Corlett for the excellent coope tion which he has given me during
my term as managing editor, even going so far as to continue to
cooperate and work on the copy desk of tiic paper, while under- fire
and even after the Publications board weakened and ousted him.
Loyalty such as he has shown during thc past six weeks, and the
ability displayed in the technical and professional end of the Scar-let
and Black will certainly aid him in whatever work he takes up, and
I regret very much that lie will be unable to carry on the policies of
the Scarlet and Black, ‘

As for circumstances, 1 am of tiic opinion that the Curriculum
committee mulfed a chance to show that the Scarlet and Black is
something more than a childish toy of a few people interested in joure
nalism. To me rt seems that the Publication board, once supposedly
as independent as the hoard of directors of any corporation, has been
forced to take a back seat and that the qualifications for editorship
will no longer be professional efficiency, but will rather- be more
grade points and hours, which, however important, in school, will
have but little weight in the fields of professional journalism.

The fact that Mr Corletl was never given a chance to display his
ability on either the professional side of tiic paper or as a fully elk
rolled student, does not seem to me to be in keeping with Gl‘lnnell's
famed boast “mouldel- of men," for to remove a man before he has
had a chance to show his worth, and merely because he was not a
fully registered student, does not seem to be a sporting- proposition.
The technicality is there, rather obscure in the college rules and
regulations, but there nevertheless when interpreted by the Curriculum
committee, but to me the action lacks any weight of authority or of
common sense.

However, that is all past history, and when the new administrde
tion takes office in April, I wish them the best of luck. To those
members of the executive editorial posts who have worked with me
during the past year or two, I wish to extend my thanks publicly
We've had our disagreements, but despite our petty problems we have
always concentrated upon producing the best possible Scarlet and
Black,

while the cooperation of the faculty and administration has left
much to be desired in the collection of news, still I feel that much
has been gained, and to those who have realized thc problems cone
nected with the publication of a semi-weekly newspaper on a small
campus, handicapped by lack of hrghly-skilled workers, I- wish to
extend my thanks.

Whether the Scarlet and Black,wlll continue to develop is a
matter no one has the foresight to see, but as my second year in
office terminates, 1 fervently wish that the succeeding generations
of 5&3 editors will hold to the policies which 1 received from those
who have gone before and which 1 now pass on to them.

The Scarlet and Black is no place for weaklings, and tiic faculty
wrath and disapproval will arise on the slightest provocation, but
to the coming administrations. 1 say Don‘t under any circumstances
permit the paper to become a media for official announcements:
Freedom of the prcss is a rare thing in this country and if it can be
maintained at Grinneil, then Grinnell W111 ti uly continue to lcad in the
educational ficlds
unless the heads of the paper are willing to fight for it, willing to
fight for an ideal, despite even personal losses at times

successful yesterday when the

the Curriculum committee,
which Monday afternoon re-
fused. to waive a. technical
eligibility requirement in the
case of Mr. Corlen, and recom-
mended that the board “find
another applicant who will be
qualified and able to work on
