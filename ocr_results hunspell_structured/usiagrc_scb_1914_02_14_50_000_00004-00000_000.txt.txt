PROTEST AGAINST RAGE HATRED

"International Mind. and Inf/err
Racial Heart” Is Subject of
Address Presented ELI.

Ford Hall.

Dr. SleIlIEi - lct-tlll‘e on "The inter-
national MIlltI and the IllIel'rltchnI
Heart." delivered at Ford Hilll in Bus:
ton on Vchrua . s. is reported at
length in the Boston Post Im' the COI‘
Telling (lay. Extiacls oi The address.
as printed in the Post. are gucu below.

"Raciat'hatred is one ot' the things
[lint is mar-ring the progress oi hue
manitr, and IL is an individual pioh-
lcm that. every one must work out for
himsclt'. it has hccn argued that the
current Ilnh'eil oi the negro, the all
eiltals, the Jews. and others are really
due to economic reasons. hut that is a
iitisttilro;as all the ccouoiu political
parties or plallorms in the world will
certainly not cure this disease at the
heart and mind.

"The average American mind deals
with people who collie to the New
World as '- Illey worn the scum at the
enl'tllillley forget that the scum is
never at the hottoin. hut always at the
top. They also target that these ink
migrants come from the mother of on i-
lizatioii. But how can you hate the
negro when you think of what he has
been through. and who led him |I|roll°ll
it? How can you hate the Jew cai-
ing his bundle at 2000 years ot agou,
on his shoulders. agony which you
helped to ore-ate and which only synr
pathyroan clu'e’!’

“Racial hatred is not a natural in-
stinct. Children of diiticrout l'rtces
can play together in perfect lilis , and
it will he iound that hatred ot this hind
in children luv-.irinhlr comes from
conversations overheard it n their
elders, or perhaps irom had literature.
As lor the Japanese. they do not ed.
grade lahor. Labor is one of the limbs
lost lhillgs‘ill the world and it cannot
be degraded. .\'or have the Japanese
lowered the price or in the
West. They ask their price and the .
stand up for their rights. and thei- are
not popular there because they cannot
