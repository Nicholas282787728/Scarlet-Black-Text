1938 Prospects
Brighter At Close
Of Spring Practice

By Edward “115011

Only four practices have been
scheduled for the football squad
this week, according to Coach
Guy Lookahaugh. ’I'he intrasquad
game originally scheduled for this
weekend has been cancelled and
all preparations point toward
next weekend's game.

AS the spring season draws to
a close, the prospects for the 1938
gridders look brighter. Among
those who look good in practice
thus far are Bill Fort, back, who
will play his last season next
year, Fort was injured in Octo-
her of his sophomore year and
was unable to finish the season.
Last year he started reporting
too late to do the squad any good.

Robert Moehl and George Tomp-
kins, backfield men, are continu-
ing to improve, but this being
their first season out, they remain
unknown quantities.

Joe Woodward, end and tackle,
will be eligible for another sea—
son, according to Lookabaugh,
and his height and weight should
add to the rating of the squad.
Russell Berg, who will be a ju-
nior tackle, is doing well and
seems to have recovered from an
injury sustained last fall.

Edward Vaughn, center, who
has understudied two very caps:
hle centers for the past two
years, is not reporting for pram
tice. Lookabaugh said he is un-
certain whether Vaughn will he
cut in the fall. Robert Young,
who will he a sophomore next
year, began reporting for drills
this week and with conditioning
should be valuable‘ backfield ina-
terial.
