Respecting spaces and supporting community

A few weeks ago,l received an invitation to write
an “8&3 professor column". The possible topics
ran through my head: Why every Grinncii strident
should take CS; the wonder of Grinnell’s faculty
governance (even more complicated than selfrgow
cinincs); comments on Wikipcdia (including my
vision oflr future in which everyone will have his or
her own VVikipedirr entry, and the disambiguation
page for “John smith" will be huge) ; why I regularly
refuse interviews from the 58413 (although it’s a],
ways fun to predict whether-i will
be (a) misquoted or (b) quoted
out of context); even another rant
about drinking on campus.

Their things started happen—
ing on campus that made me
want to scream. (No, I take that
back,I did scream; I felt like put—
ting my ﬁst through a will, but
managed to avoid doing that.)

So I wanted to write about the Grinnell I love
a the Grinnell filled with people who are not just
talented, creative, intelligent, but also (and more
importantly) open, caring, supportive, inclusive. and
respectful s and how I hoped we could preserve that
Grinnell.

But I must admit that there are a huge number of
people who can write better about such rhiiigs, many
of whom have already written. A week or so before
break, as I walked into Noyce, I noticed that some,
one had drawn a red heart on the North door, in
red magic marker. I thought to myself”Even ifrhat
was intended as a nice gesture, someone is going to

have to work pretty hard to get that ink off the door.”
And it became clear to me that I could and should
write ahour the importance orrespscr, not just ofyour
peers, but also of the spaces around you and of the
people responsible for those

spaces. (Ofcourse,hcrc1am
more than halfway through
my eoiumri,and I'm just gets
ting to the topic. Oh well,
let’s hope for editorial leni—
ency on
c o l u m it
length.) As i walk through our
new, wonderful, science bu ding,
I am stunned by the many ways
that people have thoughtlessly
treated it.

There are brand-new walls
that have been ruined by students
taping rhings up. (Sorry, but most
kinds of tape do damage paint and drywall. You
should always ask ﬁrst.)

For much of ﬁrst semester, people would regularly
walk out an alarmed door, sometimes repeatedly, dis
rupringborh classes and experiments.
(I am happy to report that this dis-
ruption has stopped). Stupid posters
are stuck in difficult-rmreach pluses.
Draft directional signs that ask for
feedback are filled with snide coma
merits, making it hard to tell which suggestions are
serious and which are facetious. And, asI mentioned
earlier, people draw on doors (and other places).

When you don't treat the space around you with
respect, you affect not only the spaces, but also the
people around you. Broadly, these actions make the
building a less pleasant place to he in. More pars
ticuiariy, someone has
to spend the time cleans
ing marker off of doors
and finding ways to take
down posters hung in
difﬁcult-to-r‘ench places.

I don't know our
Custodial and PW
staff nearly well enough, but I do know that they
work very hard and that their regular responsibilities
already ﬁll their work time. They should not have to
spend ettra work on these unnecessary messes.

I’m probably out of space. I've certainly rambled
on more than I’d permit from my Tutorial students.
What do I Want you to take out of this column?
First, think more carefully about the consequences
ofyour denomieven things that may seem small to

remember that Grinnell benefits from a large num-
ber of dedicated and hdrdﬂ’votkir‘lg staff members
(FM, custodial, academic sup
port, dining services, and many
more that I've missed) and take
the time to thank them [or the
hard work they do. (Yes,i know
that I haven’t argued the second
point in this column. Do it anyway) Be supportive
ofa wide community of peopiel

Crady never met with either stu-

irwe can’t make more guidelines for

resents the personal attention and stu-
dent involvement that selfsgovernzrnce
