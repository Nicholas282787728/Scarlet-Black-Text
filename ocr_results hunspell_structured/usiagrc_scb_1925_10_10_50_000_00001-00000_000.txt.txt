The decision of literary society ofr
ficers not to reorganize, which was
announced last week, was further
substantiated Thursday, when socier
ty men voted 45-5 in favor of the
abolishment of societies. As a result
of this decisive action. steps have been
taken for the organization of a new
debahng society on the campus.

The most definite action to form a
new forensic society was taken )‘esr
terday when James Work, Loren Reid,
Herold Hicks, Russell Smith and
Robert Burlingamc together with Ear-l
.1. Beam appointed themselves as a
committee, with James Work as
chairman and Russell Smith as secrer
tary, to draw up a constitution for the
new society. From the discussion
held by the group it is probable that
the new organization will be much
larger than the old Debating union,
which was limited to two men from
each society It is likely that the
constitution \ ‘_ll provide for a meni-
bership of twenty to be chosen upon
a tryout basis. ‘

It is the plan of the constitutional
committee to place the mancgcmcnt
of varsity debating in the hands of
an executive conunittcc of the new
society. This committee will make all
arrangements concerned with sclleilr
uling debates and will look after fin—
ances as the president and secretary

be a function of the new body.

in ‘a meeting \l'cdncsday night the
society heads, Vcldon Mo r, Robert
Burlingame., Albert b’icolet, Irwin
Sampson, Harry Lambly. Elmer
Chase, Eugene Woodrnff and Russell
Smith, together with Dean James
Findlay and James Work, represents
tive of last year’s debating union, dis-
cussed thc disposal of society prop
erty. Each society is the owner of a
piano, considerable statuary. chairs
and other furniture, all of which the
committee decided to sell to the highs
est bidder, the money to be given to
the new debating organization. In
the past years the School of Music
has used the pianos, free of charge.

It was at the Wednesday night's
meeting thatis was decided to hold a
ballot upon the reorganization of so-
cieties. The vote taken in the A. R.
H. reading room was light, only 51
of about a hundred society men in
school voting.

Chase was the only letter man of
last year's team to report. Captain
Wing and Moran, letter men of last
year are members‘of the varsity fools
hall squad and will not appear until
the close of the grid season.

The prep squad of last winter was
well represented with Smiley, last
years captain, Brzuson, Mark, anf~
man, Peterson, struble and Becker-

Locke, Culver, McCarty, Bradstrect
and Pederson. Doffing, a varsity
squad man of last year is expected
out soon, Sceland, reserve centcr of
last year and Davis and Spencer will
report after football is over.

Although three letter men, Gelvin,
Winter and Bogs, were lost by gradu.

are good. The first conference game
is with Nebraska at Lincoln, January

be arranged before that date.
