eﬂ'ects of that. But when we’ve had really eifect‘lve and
active outreach, it’s made a big difference. And now that
we’re sort of doing it in two directions, it’s making an
even bigger dieerence.

Plus, 1 have to say, it's also the quality of the shows
were doing. We’ve kepr a very high level of quality with
the exhibitions, and what that does is it continues to
draw audience‘s from beyond the coinmunityWe are now
deﬁnitely a player in the art world in Iowa.

We make sure our name is out there all the time with
the shows we're doing.

RP: I was wondering too how is it balancing both
being a museum, independent and also being on a college

’ campus. Is that a difficult balance to strike?

LW: I don't think so. I used to work at the Cedar
Rapids Museum before, which is a private museum in
Cedar Rapids. And l actually found that harder because
you didn't have an audio e that assumed there was going
to be content to an exhibition. And here people are very
comfortable with the fact that there's content. It’s not
just entertainment So I think being on a college campus
gives us the luxury oftaking seriously the things that we
do and the things that we show and being able to think
about it in a way that’s beyond just trying to entertain
people and get them in the door.

Not that other museums don't do that, but sometimes
that’s harder to do within the community, some commue
nitics. soI ﬁnd it a very natural balance, but I’m the prod-

uct ofa small liberal arts college. It makes sense to me.

RP: How do you see the Gallery evolving? In the next
10 years, in the next year, what are you looking forward to?

LW: One of the things that we have continued to
do over the past 10 years is we’ve continued to develop
the collection.

As the collection gets stronger, and as we do more
with being able to present the collection in ditterenr
ways using oneline and digital resources,l think how we
use the collection in our exhibitions is going to become
a place where we can be creative and where things are
going to shift a bit.

in recenr years we've been doing more exhibitions
that we ourselves are curating out of the collections. So
it’s becoming a resource for us to mine and look at in difs
ferent ways. One of the things we’ve talked about doing,
that other schools have done some of, is to bring artists to
campus for residencies who then work with the collection
and work with students so that they bring fresh eyes to
the collection and develop other kinds ofprojects using
the resources we have heteAnd I’d love to do something
like that where we can really be a facilitator for other kinds
of projects with artists as well as with the art.

Itwould be good down the line ifwe could develop
some berter ways ofdoing some ofour own fundraising
because I think that might give us ﬂexibility we don’t
always have. Right now we get a good budget from the
College but we, except for writing grants, we really don’t

go out and raise money from donors. And we’ve talked
about developing our own membership, which a lot
of college museums have. us a way ofcullivating and
developing sorr ofa supporr group. And also it's a way
of cultivating and developing interest in art, sort of over
a iifetimbit’s a way of expanding our mission of what
we’re doing already, but that's for down the line.

RP: That's very exciting. Do you have any other ﬁnal
rhings you wanr to say about the Gallery and where it's
been?

LW: It's been a great 10 yearsl can't believe it's been
10 years, ir's gone by very, very fastrwdve been very lucky
in having the support of the College to do what we do
and I’m hoping that continues~1 see no reason why it
won’t.”lhere’s all sorts of things we can do out there and
we’re excited to see what’s going to happen next.

I would like there to be a way that every student
comes through the Gallery in their time here. And I
think something we would like to develop is a way to
make the Gallery into a more integral part ofNew Stur
dent Orientation or ﬁnd ways to do even better outreach
to students. Because I think it’s a challenge for college
museums,because it’s a stable audience in that there are
always students here. but it’s never the same students. So
you can’t do something onee,you have to continue to do
things that bring students in and keep them engaged in
what you're doing.
