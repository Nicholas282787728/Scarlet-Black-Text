Leaders of Chicago program seek to serve students and keep costs down

Kady Cardullo called you crazy
trembling with one nail-bitten hand
inside her back pocket.

Her voice quietly crocned

across the cracked blacktop, beside
an asbestos—old basketball, leftover
like a peeled, uneaten tangerine, past
The Stumps where teachers sucked on cigarettes,
echoing from a fire escape

dried with gym sweat and guano.

 

I remember how we lived on asphalt,

you, the big—boned pioneer of the peachfuzz beard,
and me, your astigmatic brawn Mather, sitting

like two ronin on suburban side streets

lording over candied katanas of Charleston Chew,
reciting Biggie, while cutting math class—

That was before you kissed Kady, everywhere
except the mouth, before the girls
double—dumbed, their recess rhymes

a Rashcmon He said, She said,

before the soccer moms strongcarmed

your sorry ass out of state,

before I found youishogun

of some fast food joint, paper

crown ketchup—stained, looking
like you killed a man.

The program, which attracts students interested in visual,
performing, language, media and commercial arts, offers the
freedom to explore the art world beyond the college campus

Danny Zamora '08, who is considering
participating in the program next se-
lnCSICL “We’re in the Grinnell bubs
ble so we’re not really seeing what’s
going on in the real world.”

The program is open to junior
and senior students from the 14
ACM member colleges, including
Griniicll. Carleton, Bcloit, and
Ripon, as well as to nonrACM
students.

is that you get to create your own

Likely due not to the curriculum, but to competition with other
ofﬂcampus study programs, even when the appeal of traveling
abroad is not a factor.

Sally Webster ’08 was considering going to Chicago this
semester, but instead decided to spend it in New Orleans. “1

felt that my time would be hetter spenthere [in New Orleans],”
she said in an e-mail.“Thc Chicago Arts Program sounded just
fine, but my priorities changed when I came to NOLA with
AltBreak this October." ‘

Change is coming to Chicago, partially in response to one
rollmcnt issues. The ACM plans on revamping the program's
curriculum, which currently consists of four components: the
Core Course, an internship,a studio workshop and an indepen-
dent study projcct in an effort to broaden its appeal and pmc
fessional impact and. of course, to lessen the ﬁnancial impact,
they will eliminate the studio workshop element.

Chenette, who is the chair ofrhe ACM Committee respon-
sible for ﬁnding a replacement component, said the decision
was motivated "mostly by cost," He said the us also “a recog-
nition that ACM can’t offer the sort offacilities that campuses
can offer, so why should they try.> What they really should be
doing is getting students out into
the city and trying to figure out
how, when they graduate from
college and move to a city some
where, they're going to he able to
carry on making their arr.”

instead of the workshop, he
said, the program might offer a
course that would reinforce the
internship aspect, which is often
cited as one of the most valuable
opportunities of the semester. No
decisions have been ﬁnalized, how-
ever. Chenctte stressed that art-
making will remain at the center of
the experience. “It was unanimous
that the core purpose of the Chi-
ca 0 Arts Pro ram should remain

arts, not art appreciation,” he said.

Some students worry how this
change will arrest the program experience, Shannon Edwards
’07 recently returned from Chicago and expressed doubts con
cerning the modiﬁed curriculum. “1 know that the internship is
something that they count on for drawing a lot of people in,"
she said. “But I heard so many students on this program say
that they were so thankful for having the creativecbased inde
pendent study, because it was the only time they got to do what
they truly wanted to do."
