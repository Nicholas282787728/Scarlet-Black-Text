those sent lctters were in the campus quccr
community, although some were not nctive

While Briscoe said that security cannot
currently say who may have sent the letters, he
suspected the perpctrntors are part orthe Cole
loge community. “I think it 1v1s someone on
Campus, to be honest,"Btisco: said.

Sheree Andrews, associate dean and di~
rectol of Student Life, said whoever sent the
letters likely had information about t1 ic queer
community It w11s clcnrly somebody who had
access to a directory and it was somebody who
w1s on c1n1pns 111 could come on c11npus"s1id
Andrews. “It was someone who knew who was
associated the LGBTQconununiry."

Briscoc snid that security could not yet
my whether the incident is connected to 11st
wcckcnd's anti-queer vandalism but that they
nre pursuing 1 number ofleads. Both Briscoc
and Assistant Director ofSccurity Russ Mottn
seid that they ore currently muting to V1ntns

tions 1bont the response by the other half ofGrinncll’s come
munity—the town.

While the incidents haVc l1rgely consumed campus life for
two weeks, they are much less visible in town. Still, despite the
low proﬁle or the incidents in town, community le1deis ex-
pressed solidarity with students and discussed the possibility of
furthered cooperation between the town and the school1

At 11stTht1rsd1y's rally in response to the vandalism, As-
sistant Dean and Director of International Student Services
and a member ofthc Grinnell Human Rights Commission Ja-

nct Alcxandcr, read tin ofﬁcial statement from the commisswn
condemning the vandalism and stating support for Grinnell
students.“Wc wanted to make sule that the students knew that
the commission telt th1t what h1ppened nus 11111cccpt1ble 1nd

Alexander said that when the commission drafted and ap—
proved the statemcnr, it did not niricip1re such 1 strong r:—
1ction from the college. 1 wns amazed re1lly 11 the response
of students when I rend that statement, "Alexander said. We
we1e hoping 11111 it would be well received 1nd WC wanted to
let them know tl111 we were on bo1rd. but 1 ms struck by how
much it seemed to mom to the students that the city was in

Despite the 1crivity of the I—lnmnn Rights Commission,
other membcis of thc town are less informed Grinnell Mayor

Gaidon Canﬁeld said that he hzid not heard about the vandal-
ism or mailings

While Cnnﬁcld could not yet sny what the towns response
might be he condemned the 1ctiv111es and expressed support
fora the community. ‘I dont understand it for one thing and I
don't Like it and l would hope that citizens of Gtinnell are far
above things like that." Canﬁcld said. “I want to make sure that
everyone h1s 1 good life here 111 Grinnell. We just don’t need
that here in Grnmcll,"
