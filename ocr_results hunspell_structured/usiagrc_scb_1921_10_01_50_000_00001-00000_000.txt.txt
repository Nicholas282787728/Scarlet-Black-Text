Buff Back from Meeting of Valley.

Athletic Directors—Unable to
Reach Decision at K. G.

n. J. “Dec" Huff returned Tuesday
night from Kansas Ci where he at
tended a meeting of the athletic di
rectors or the Missouri valley Cong
Ierence tor the purpose of arranging
the basketball schedules. Gl'in'nell is
to have a long list or games this year,

altho the meeting broke up without a:

deﬁnite schedule being decided upon.

The meeting this year had to con-
sider an altogether new proposition
and found considerably difficulty in
solving the matter. It was ﬁrst de-
cided by vote that the double round
robin form of schedule would be
adopted: that of having every team
in the valley appear for one game at
every other school. It was after this
step that the conference found diffi-
culty in drawing up a satisfactoiy
schedule,

The new style of schedule which it-

was decided should be adopted, while
it will increase the cxpensec or the
Valley schools, has many decided ail-
i-antagos. By giving the ians at ev-
er school an opportuni - to see each
team in the Valley in action, interest
in the game will be increased many—
rold, the Valley directors believe. At
the end of the season the student body
of each school is to be given an OD‘
portunity to vote on an All-Viilley
team, and will be in a position to do
this from having seen each squad in
action.
.Another advantage or the proposed
new system is that it will eliminate
any arguments about the holders of
the Valley championship. in past
years it has been impossible tor-every
team to play every other one, and this
has in several cases caused dispute'
as to clear title to the ﬁrst honor .
Tuesday's meeting did result in the
dr-alting of a tentative schedule which
has, however, a number or detects
that it is hoped can be eliminated. An
otiicial schedule will be turmoil and

{also to promote a better citizenship.

There has been much conjecture on

lone because many positions are so
hotly contested that it seems that only

probable that Coach Saunders, with
this aim in mind, will use as many
