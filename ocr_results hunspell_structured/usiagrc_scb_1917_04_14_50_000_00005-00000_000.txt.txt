be rushed into military service.”

Professor u’rchofl spoke of the need
of men to produce agricultural pro»
ducts, and said he thought the goverm
meut should recognize such work as
comparable with the strictly military
service. "Definite recognition of agri—
cultural scrvico by the government,
and even the adoption of a uniform,
would be a great encouragement, and
would help us win the war. Another
desirable thing would he the guaran-
teeing to the farmers or a minimum
price for their products raised during
the present crisis.”

Take A tltury Training.

Prof. E. B. T. Spencer, of the Greek
department, a man extremely familiar-I
with European affairs heeause of his
residence in Italy for many years, vcry
definitely stated his advice in the inat-
tc "In view of the tact that the si -
uatton is not wholly understood cvcn

nearly representative of what should
be expected 01 a newspaper man or
woman. The screamed "cannuus notes”
of the past are no more. Instead, the
tryroutel' is required to cover society
news for five issues, following closely
the style used in the big dailies. This
number is one less than was the case
formerly with the "campus notes."
New One Alldetl.

A new requirement has been added.
Rather it is voluntary with the wri —
or. That is, if he wishes he may oc-
casionally hand in little news items
which might show his ability to find
news. These would be different from
those assigned on the bulletin board
to staff members and would consist of
anything which the try»outer might
find of his own accord. This is not a
necessary. requirement, hilt if com-
pleted the person will probably have a
greater chance of being elected.

of singers and there was not a single
