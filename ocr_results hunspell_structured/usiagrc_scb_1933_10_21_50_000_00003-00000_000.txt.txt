THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

By JACK KELSEY

Now that the game with the Hos-
kell Indians has been definitcly
scheduled for Nov. 11, Armistice Day.
the Pioneer gridders have a real
schedule for the season, and one of
the hardest that they have played for
several years. Creighton played the
Indians recently and was held to a
scoreless game. Next week another
Missouri valley team, Oklahoma Ag—
gies, will meet the Haskell eleven

. The Indians hail from 27 d- {on

cut tribes located in 27 diirci-ciit

towns and cities of the nine states

of the [lldjml nation. The so p ,

em on the squall average 177
poinids. The linemen ride the scale

lit 133, while the ball carriers aver

age 187. With this light an uggre-
gation, it is readily understood why
the team resorts to passes and first
running plays instead of plunges.

Conch Gus Welcli, Chippewa lndinu,

and former pupil of Pop Warner at

old carhsle, is quoted as adopting
his system to the material on hand,

instead of sticking to a set rule.

All plans for the fall track meet
have been abandoned Lack of inter-
est nnd material are the reasonsfor
its being dropped. but certain re‘serr
vations have been made for the con»
tinuance of the cross-country compe-
tition, and possibly for the Mike Pi -
brow trophy.
