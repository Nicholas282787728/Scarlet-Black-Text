By Garland DeNelsl-ly

A combination of weak hitting
and pitching, together with me—
diocre ﬁelding, spelled doom for
the Grinnell baseball squad in
its last four contests. in these
games Pioneer hitters could
muster only 20 hits while al-

lowing their opponents 45 De-

entertained Monmouth on the
local diamond. The Scots

downed the Pioneers, 14-1, be- ‘

aided the Monmouth cause.

onmouth collected 12 hits
including ﬁve extra base
knocks. Cooper led the Mon-
mouth attack with four hits
for ﬁve times at bat includ-
ing a double and a home run.
Dave Van Anrooy led Grim

Saturday Knox crushed Plo-
neer hopes twice in a double-
header. In the ﬁrst game Knox
collected 14 base hits as comv
pared to the three-hit eﬁort of
the Pioneers This superior hit-
ting, combined with four Gri a
hell miscues accounted for the
lopsided 17-3 score Brown led
Knox hitting with a double and
triple.

in the secde game Grinnell
came back to play much better
ball. The contest was close all
the way, hut: a vital run in the
seventh permitted the Scots
to edge the Pioneers so.
Grinnell failed to get clutch
hitting, (or nine Pioneers were
lett stranded on the bases.

chance to represent lows in the

are the best tasting cigarettes on earﬂl. They le packed with rich good- -tastirlg
tobacco, toasted to taste even better. So the senior who doesn’ I; receive em is bound
to be a Sad Grad ’ Why leL parents spoil commellcementiit only happens (Sob!) once.
