This Thursday in the Houstont‘istro-
dome, with Howard Cosell at the
mike, Billie Jean King will avenge
the honor oi the fairer sex by re—
turning the complimeht that Bobby
Biggs paid to Margaret Court ear-
lier this year. King, the 29 year
old American tennis star who is
at the peak oi her career, will
beat Riggs, the 55 year old, vitamin
pill popping geriatric, to prove that
a senior mens’ player cannot beat
the world’s number one women's
star,

Bille Jean has too much on Riggs
tor the latter to beat her as he
whipped Margaret Court, 572, 6-1
on May 13. Margaret played a poor

match, Riggs played well, and the
entire tone of the match made it
less than that of an athletic can-
test than a television producer’s
piece as resistance Thedlrlerences
between the two women are dis—
tinct. The American has long been
a proponent of Women's rights and
has voiced this opinion. She is the
reason for the success of the Vir»
ginia Slims tour and is the founder
of the Women's Tennis Association,
She constantly speaks out ior this
Cause. Last year she said that she
wouldn't compete at this year’s
US Open at Forest Hills unless
the women’s prize money was equal
to the men's, It took a gift of a
$55,000 cosmetic manufacturer to
prize money
($25,000 to the singles winners) but
at least this is a step in the right
direction,

Both Billie Jean and her Austra-
lian counterpart play serve and voll-
ey tennis with big overheads. Riggs
says that the California winner oi
this year’s Wimbledon singles title
(her fifth) has, “a big overhead
and bigger mouth.” King has a hard
serve that enables her to use her
speed in getting to the net. Against
Biggs, Margaret never came to the
net, and Riggs caught her hat-
iooted withamixture oispins,chops,
and dinks from the baseline. Billie
Jean possesses strong groundstro-
kes that tend to iorce her opponent
back, Her backhand is a mixture
of flat and underspins that tend to
go to the backhand Side oi an upper

nent, but she also has tine place-
ments, lier biggest asset, in her
playing game, is her determination
to scramble tor every shot thus
retrieving shots that may seem
like surewinners

Riggs game has deteriorated since
his winning both the Wimbledon and
Forest Hills titles in 1939. He has
a slice, almost sidearm serve that
tends to break away from the re-
ceiver His second serve spins and
sometimes he will intentionally lob
the ball to put the other player in
a bad position. l-lis groundstrokes
are all sott placements that tend
to rattle opponents with their deftr
nBSS. L

There is a second, almost more
important side to this match. Riggs,
who is down to 210 vitamins a day
from the 455 he took in May, has
contended that, ”there isn’t sex
aiter 55 anyway,” so why not let
him min the women’s tour. When

asked about Riggs at the US Senior
Men’s clay courts in Lake Bluff,
Ill, earlier this summer, Pancho
Gonzales noted that, “he won’t even
come here to play men his own
age. We’d beat him...l>le might be
embarassed.” Bobby is not to be
iaulted ior not playing Gonzales,
aiter all Pancho is a youngster oi
45, Riggs is a hustler; he’ll play
on roller skates, withboxing gloves,
a pail oi water in his hand, wear»
ing a dress, with boots and an um-
brella on, with a patch on one
eye, with benches on the court, and
with a dog tied to his leg. He
won't admit how much he's made
doing this but friends call it a
“considerable” amount He denies

Members of the cross countryteam
got up at 5:30 am, Saturday to
make the trip to Indianola for the
annual Crazy Day ilve mile run.
It was raining, and the course was
very muddy and slippery, but des-
pite this, the Grinnell crew ranwell
in the 25 man field.

Dave Rauh took the lead from the
start and ran away with the race
With one mile to go the spotters
directed Dave to make a wrong
turn and he wound up on a dead
end street. He finally got back on
course, but it cost him 5 minutes
and 5 places. Raul) was so far in
front that he was righttuiiyawartr
ed iirst place by the iinish judges
anyway.

Mark Blanchard was the next Gri-

women’s tenni . She was the first
women’s athlete ever to earn
$100,000 in a year. She endorses
dozens or products and, not deny—
ing her feminity, wears some oi
the most eye catching clothes on
the tour. As a proponent of War
mens’ Lib, she won't be psyched
out by the “mothers' day” tactics
used by Riggs against Margaret
Court. Margaret took a year off
the tour (it didn’t hurt her game
any) to have a child. Several weeks
ago a' story was printed saying
that the abortions Ms. Steinam and
Ms, King claimed to have were
hoaxes to drum up support (or their
cause, Billie Jean has commented
that she isn't impressed by all oi
Riggs' mouthings about the match.
She is definitely "her own woman.”
Should she win, King will collect
$200,000 and if she plays defensive
tennis like Margaret and loses she
will receive half that amount. The

television rights, besides, should
be staggering. It’s Bobby Riggs,
the ham, hustler, rogue, and hero
of the senior weekend league, vs.
Billie Jean King, the star oi wo-
men's tennis, the libber, who is out
to set the record straight as she
sees it, Riggs is the last athletic
hope that his “ancients, the senior
players, and old guys" have intheir
argument that women should stay
in the kitchen, have children, and
slay.out or politics.

in the iirst set Billie Jean could
be rattled by Riggs soit style oi
play. However, the longer the match
goes on the stronger her game should
get. Predicted scores are useless,
but here’s mine: Billie Jean King,
the 4-1 underdog, to win 6-4, 572.

Slims Trshlrt and wear it around

man Judah Garber came in ninth,

Paul Kennedy linished eleventh, and
Neal Kleeermen Came in thirteenth.

Neal was another runner who was
directed the wrong way and cost
him an extra 15 seconds. Neal's
wrong turn came at the iinish line.
Alterwards, Neal quipped, ”Now
1 know why they call it Crazy Day.”
The team’s times were much im-
proved over last year’s times and
the squad is very optimistic about
the upcoming season.

The women oi Grinnell ran a 1.7
mile course and fared well. Laurie

gent with a third place iinish. Judy
