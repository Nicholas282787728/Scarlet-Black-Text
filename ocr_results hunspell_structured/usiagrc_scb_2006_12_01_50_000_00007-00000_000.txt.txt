WHEN HARRIS
ISN'T FOR YOU

BY CHEVON CHATMAN_8L TJl HAWLEY

Meredith Decker '10 went to the ﬁrst few
Harris parties before dectding to avoid Brown
Bag. “1 like a little bit of sketchiness, but that
was far too sketchy for my taste," she said, Ina
stead, she went to the improv show and then
watched Bond ﬁlms wida friends.

Grinncll students all know about the weekly
Harris parties, but when it comes to alternative
weekend plans, many are a hit more in the dark.
Others go oi? campus to parties or spend the
evening in their room with friends, studying
or watching movies. But the administration
attempts to provide structured entertainment
for those not drawn to the weekends parties
and revelry

The administration’s Weekend Wellness
offers a sub—free setting for a variety of games
and activities.The program, which was started
in 2003, has different events each week, like
Dance Dance Revolution and t shirt mak-
ing, as well as game night and glow- in rhe—
dark dodgeball Kim Hinds Brush RLC for
Loosehead, estimates that anywhere from two
to so people come to the events, based on the
event of the week

“11’: open to everyone on campus"said Billy
Kennedy, East Campus RLC, “It serves as an
outlet for students that don’t drink and those ‘
that do, those that go to Harris parties and

‘ those that don't."

Erin Sindewald’OS has been to many of the
Wellness events with large groups offriends.“I
think it would be weird ifyou went by yourself
...hut ifyou gowith nbig group, its awesome,"
she said.

The Wellness programs are not for every- ,
hody. “Wellness events are usually really lame,"
said Danny Zamora ’08. Other students have
negative reactions to the program's advertise-
ments, without :ver going to the events. “You
hear shout it and are like, ‘Do people go to
tliat?’u said Logan Lewis ‘07.

Hinds-Brush is well aware of the pro
strengths and weaknesses, “It is needed," she
said. “We don’t always meet that need but
we try.”

For students who have no interest in the
Weekend Wellness offerings, concerts and
movies are always an option—Assuming they
have hcaid about what’s olfererl. Funkndesi
and Lil' Ed and the Blues Il‘nPCTlt‘lS both had
concerts at the same time as Harris parries and
wen: still well attended.

But puhlioin- seems to be a problem to.-
SUIl‘lL‘ students. “A lot of times, I don’t hear
about the concert till that night or that day,"
siiiti Jessica Schotts ’10.

Movies, both at the Hillﬂs Cinema and
the Strand, as well as in lounges with friends,
is popular among Grinnellians. When Amy
Hadow ’10 “wasn't in the mood to dance” at
Harris, she and her fricuds “watched the Prinr
eess Bride, and then just kind ofhung out."

“There’s always posters up for different
things," said Evllns. “Not thllt tliere‘s nothing
else to do; more like we just don’t feel like
doing [it]."
