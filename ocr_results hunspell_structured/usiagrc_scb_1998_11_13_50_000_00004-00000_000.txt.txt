BY ANNIKA ENGINEER
SianWrimr

A grear philosopher once said rhar
a man is norhing wirhour his plan.
Nowhere in rhe world has rhar saying
held more meaning rhan righr here ar
Grlnncll college, where rlio wriring of
a plan has become nor iusr a procrasti»
narion reehnrque, bur a verirable arr
form.

The plan serves as a medium
rhrough which rhe srudenrs can venr
rheir frusrrarions or celebrare rheir
aclrieveinenrs, lr allows one ro whine
abour work, relarionships, PMs, homc-
sickness and ofcourse, orher people,

in addirion, given rhe siee orrlns
college, rr allows one ro glean valuable
insighr inro orher people’s lives wirh-
our having in ask nosey quesrions and
be (old that it’s nonc ofyour business:
because lct’s face ir, given rhc size oirhis
college, people make ir rheir business
ro know everybody clsc’s business. ln
facr, I was iusr reading a plan rlre orhcr
day drar reflccrcd rhis same senrirnenr,
“Somerlmcs rhis place feels roo much
like high school. i iusr wish people
could worry alaour iheir own slrir, nor
cvcrybodyelsc’s.” so you see, plansalso
promorc rhe whole ‘you.are.nor.alone’
Jargon which essenrlally boils down so
rhe iaer rhar you are never isolarcd in
whar you are feeling and if you read
enough plans, you will cvenrually real
iac rhis for yourself.

Plans can also serve ro highlighr rhe
diversiry of inreresrs here or Grinnell
For insranee, we have me poer who will
demonsrrare ro us exactly how far one
can srrcreh rhe concepr ofpoetic license
oywrirings rhar combine rhings like re»
ligion and compurer science majors.
For example: “I like Jesus, he's rhe man
I iusr wrore a program in Forrran, I ber
Jesus never hurnr his ronguc, BASIC is
like compurer dungl"

Or we could examine rhe disillu»
sioncd idealisr, who is rired oirrying ro
make rhinos righr for rhe world (or ai
leasr rhe female popularion here ar
Grinnell), “1 give up. You can all live
wlrh your righr hands for rhc resr of
your lives for all I carol”

Then you have d1: peoplewho like
ro share rhcir learning cxpuicnccxwith
others; “Never sir alone wirh five
women ar dinner. You won’r per a word
in edgewise and ir you do, ihey will iusr
laugh ar you like you are some sorr of
circus freak.” ﬁrm, i guess you haven’r
read ilre hook, Mm artﬁwm Mara.

Take for example, rhe classic case of

The classic case ofa birrer rejecred

“\Wliat’s love gor do wirh k?" in which

read a few plans andyouwill come across
some new rechnioues, guaranreed ro
keep you feeling alive, such as, “ Norh.

hascly because you srepped on a poinry
fish when you were dropping acid, and
rhen looking for your losr guiness bar
scr, bur it’s in KU!" of course, you
wouldn’t really be in Jarnaca, bur use
your imaginarion and gee crearive.

You can also learn from oiher
people’s misrakes, such as if one were
discussing rhe merirs or, leis say, sea in
rhc dark:

Person 1:Maan, rhcre is iusr no way
rhar I would have scx wirh all rhe lighrs

Person 2: him, [don’t know abour
rhar. I mean rhings can ger really messy

Thus you see rhar plans can be cdu»

lege goes, rhcrc is absoluiely no such
