a mere ll seconds short of an all-
American pace. Rounding out the
scorers were Mark Beilstein 80th,
Jason Maples 84th. Chris Gar-man
95th, and Jeff Uimer 96th John
Marciari and Barry Matchett finished
in 135th and 16131 place, respec—
tively.

Coach Freeman and LheRoos were
really disappointed with their per»
formance at nationals. but with ﬁve
of the seven men sick, a 14th place
finish, up from 16th last year, is still
very respectable.

The Roos had gone in ranked 7th,
andasCoach said”westayed healthy
all season long, but in the biggest
race we had ﬁve runners sick. It was
very disappointing for the entire
team, I think if we were healthy, our
ﬁnish would have been changed by
sixtoeightplaces."ButasNawrocki
added, “it was disappointing that we
didn’t run up to our ranking, but one

Nawrocki also added on a more
positive note that the Roos “gained a
lot of valuable experience that will
help us next year." ‘

Reﬂecting on this year’s season.
Cook was really pleased. "It’s been
great to see this team improve over
my last four years and yet keep its
perspective and not become moti-
vated by success, but rather by the
enjoyment of running and of being a
pan of a group."

The Roos are already looking to
improve upon this successful season.
Matchett explained, “After a great
season, we werekind ofdisappointed .
with ourshowing at thenational meet,
however, it will inspire us in next
year’s campaign for a top five show-
ing. We‘re hungry for next year.”
Coach Freeman reiterated, “our ex-
pectations will be even higher next
year. We know that success will be
there if we want it."
