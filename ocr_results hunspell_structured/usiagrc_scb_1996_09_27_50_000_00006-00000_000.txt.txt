Kudos to the SGA Film commit»
tee for choosing The [ti-laws. This
[979 ﬁlm stan-ing Peter Falk and
Allen Arkin is one of the funniest
movies either of these reviewers has
ever seen.

The common theme of conﬂict
between inrlaws is turned upside
down in this movie. Ordinary dis-
approval is spiced up with the robe
bery ofa US Mint truck, numerous
car chases. and a briefjaunt to a ﬁcr
ti tious Latin American dictatorship.

Sheldon Kornpett, DDS. eagerly
anticipates the marriage of his
daughter Barbara, educated at Mt,
Holyoke, to Tommy, a second year
law student at Yale. However, he is
anxious about meeting his
daughter's future father-in-law only
three days before the wedding. As
one of his patients warns him, “The
son is the acorn; you got to look at
the tree".

 

The In—laws: a film the
entire family Will enjoy

Vince Ricardo, father of the
groom, insists that he is a CIA agent
determined to foil dictator General
Garcia’s plot to cause the world's
economy to “collapse like a wet
taco".

The inrlaws meet at a dinner
party, hosted by the Kornpett’s.
Vince amazes them all with stories
of his work in Guatemala where
“they got tsetse flies the size of
eagles" that carry small children
away to certain death. Things Just
get crazier from there.

Sheldon's initial impression of
Vince doesn’t even compare to the
craziness he’ll find when he meets
General Garcia, his black velvet art
collection, and the true star of this
movie: Sr. Pepe.

Though sometimes not a very,
good sport, Sheldon is finally
brought around by Vince, willingly
risking life and limb to save his new
friend. Bring your parents to this fun
filled adventure. appropriate for all
ages. The film shows Saturday at
8:30 pm. in North Lounge and Sune
day at 6:30 pin. in Harris Cinema,

Wilcox intended for one of the

physical process of painting a blank

such as in the placement of a series

“For me," he said, “the real ques-
tion is what happens when you put
something on top of something else
and it‘s still twordimensional." Ac
cordingly, Wilcox employs in many
of his paintings a technique called
layering. in which one image be-
comes partially obscured or high-
lighted by another image placed over
it.

plele docs Wilcox feel comfortable
enough to define his reaction to it in
the form of a title.

“I actually considered a lot ofpos-
slbllities for the title of the show it-
self,” he said. “I was going to call it
‘The Coffer,’ because It seemed like
I was kind orputiing everything in a
Coffer and burying it." He settled on
“Pattems and Dreams" as a less per-
sonal, all-encompassing title. “But
it's not just about patterns versus
dreams—it’s about how patterns
overlay each other and become
dreams. Icncouragc people to make
their own connections."

Wilcox, who grew up in a suburb
of Cleveland, began drawing at :m

carly age, but didn‘t become passion-
ale about art until high school. “A
lot of people talk about art as search-
ing for something, but in middle
schoolIdidn’tdo anything. It wasn‘t
until high school that Iiflgured ev-
erything out." His senior year art
teacher was particularly important to
him. assigning “fantastic" projects
which helped foster his growing in
lerest in art.

Wilcox feels the strong drawing
background he got in high school
aided in the transition to Grinnell
courses. “I already knew how to
draw when I got here. I didn't have
to start from scratch " He did not
come to Grinnell with the speciﬁc
intention of majoring in art, but res
alizcd his first year that he didn't
want to spend a semester hero with
out taking an art course. Declaring
his major was the next logical step.

Though he would like art to play
a role in his life after Grinnell.
Wilcox has IIOl yet decided iflie will
pursue ‘t\ livelihood in painting, Cit—
ing the randomness and
unpredictability of success in the art
world, “You can bc as good as any
one else out there, and still become
your mom's favorite nightmare about
a starving artist. [don‘t think I’ll be
doing painting, but definitely some-
thing that comes out of it."

Wilcox is currently considering
applying for the Ninth Semester in
the Aits program at Grinnell.
