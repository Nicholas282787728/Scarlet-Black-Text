Political Film Committee
Examines Cultural Revolution

By Tanweer Akram

The International Political
Film Commilec will show A
Night in an Art Gallery on
March 15, 1990 at 7:30 in
South Lounge (Forum)
Produced at the end of the
Cultural Revolution, this
animation mocks the
repressions of the Mac regime

This is an interesting film
because it reveals the control
mechanism of Mao. The
Communist party used similar
repression methods to supress
the student protest in 1989. We
hope this documentary will be
useful to students of Chinese
and East Asian studies,
International Relations, and
Political Science.

Sellers: The
Mouse That
Roared

who plays three parts in this“
film with an “Iowa connection”. ‘
as Marshalltown native, loan

Seabcrt, plays the heroine. '

The film’s ridiculous bub
charming plot relates the story
of the Grand Duchy ot‘
Fcnwiek‘ s attempt to avoid-
bankruptcy by declaring war on
the United States, expecting to
be splendidly rehabilitated when—
it loses. However the plan i
goes askew when the little]
invading army captures a“:
scientist and his newly 1‘
developed “terrible weapon,”
putting Fcnwick in a position-
to make the world “sit up and i
listen to reason." The scene of
the invading force dressed in«
costumes reminiscent of Robin 1
Hood movies (complete with'
bows and arrows) as they attack
the deserted streets during an air-
raid ranks among the best in‘
comedic cinema. .

The movie will show next
Thursday in South toung’
