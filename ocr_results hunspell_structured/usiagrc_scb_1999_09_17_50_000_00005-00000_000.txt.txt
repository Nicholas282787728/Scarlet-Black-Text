_On fhe evolution of Indian Sobji
By Sean McGinly

Last summer i stayed in crinnell to do an intensive study oerddle
English (ﬁrmer/J, ﬁrirr stoodrnul). To pay the bills, I got a tub working for
crinneil Municipal Meat racking thanks to the CD0. My official job
title was “Assistant Disgorgi-t."

When I wasn’t working on "the death slab," as tlicycnlled it at the plant
and when I wasn't reading Chaucer's epic, “Fannie Facr-re's Fiiiail nrn go“
by candlelight, i would pass the hours wandering about campus, picking
daridelions, smelling pinecoiies and watching the squirrels chaseeacli other

But during my quiet walking
meditations, I made a horrifying
discovery.

First, some basic biology back
ground is tequltcd for my story:

1. Nature naturally works on a
system called mlfum/tt/(rriarl. Baa
srcaliy, this means that only the
strongest ofeach species survive to
produce offspring and walur. or
change, Natural selection and cvn-
lutron is going on right now, but
so slow that you can't even see it.
The process will evcntually stop
when nature reaches the apex of
cvolution: a 30efoot flying alligator
with lasereguided missiles.

2. This process of natural 55»
lectron only works correctly where
the mechanical hand of
humankind’s oppression has not yet
altered the earth, screnticians call
this the “natural state." For ex»
ample, take the Galapagos, Antarc»

He kept

He stood tlier nd than grinned

whcre humans have probably lived
for years, the natural process afcvo-
lution gets interrupted, or falls plain
out ofwhack,

Lamentably, the squirrels on Grinncll's catnpus do not Exist in a natural
state. Aside from the occasional lucky dog or child with a b.b. gun, squirt
rels are rarely killed. At Grinncll, squlttcls have no natural predators to
keep their population in check, They do not evolve.

in the spring the squlrtcls fornicate and multiply, and in the summer
their numbers are many.

Last summer I saw them, masses of them, more than the trees could
support. There were not enough nuts and berries for them all. Then cries
ofhunger made an awful racket, once, I saw two squirrels fighting over a
Buttetfinger wrapper.

Ofcoutse, in the “natural state“ there would be no problem. A wolvet.

Letters To

Dear Editor,

Andy Civettini‘s article on Bill Bradley and Al Cort: in last weeks s at
B made its point .. that Bradley must WIN the nomination, while Gore
simply needs not to losc, However, Mr. Civcttinl's perception ofdie two

candidates is a bit off. He paints Gore as more liberal than Bradley, which i

is a very questionable interpretation of their stands, He also calls Gore's
environmental policy "very aggressive" and states that "for hardacor: crlvi-
ronmentalists . . , [Gore] seems moreofa friend than Bill Bradley",

These are incorrect assessments. Gore clearly cares about the environ

ment, and he taiks abrg game, but he has yet to walk thewalk. iworked for
an environmental agency on capitol Hill this summer and came into cone
tact with numerous environmentalists ftbm various organlzatjons. Not one
orthosc activists with whom i discussed politics prererrcd core to Bradley,
environmentally or on the whole, These are some of the most radical. Iibe
eral, and knowledgable young pcoplc in the country. Gore‘s positions on
issues are more clear than Bradley's at this point, to be sure, but core still
has a lot to prove to the Left.

Dear Editor,

This letter is in response to Andrcw Civettinl’s rcccntculumn about the
Democratic ptimary.This is not meant to “cut his throat”, as he feared, but
instead address the common misconception that Al Gore is the environ-
mental movement's best friend.

Although once an environmental hero, largely due to his book “Earth
in the balance", the Vice President has waffled on nearly every environ»
mental issuc the Clinton Administration has considered

For example, as the EPAcurrently considers a.proposal to make all new
cars pollute lcss. the Vice President has failed to demonstrate‘any support
for the measure. This proposal, which many environmental groups call the
single biggest step Americans can take to curb global warming, would tn—
sutc that cars go further on a gallon of gasoline and emit lcss pollution.
Many fear the Vice President has tcmained silent in order to woo auto
industry campaign cash in his battle against both Bill Bradley and the Re.
publican nominee,

However, while the Vice President is out fundraising, scientists are con-
sistently demonstrating the impacts ofclimatechangc. In fact, weather this
summer. including the East Coast droughts, extreme heat in the Midwest
and major ﬂoods here in Iowa, are consistent with scicntist’s predictions of
global warming's early warning signs. The screncc cxists; now it’s time for
politicians to address solutions,

Due to this fact, Free the Planets global warming proyect group is em.
barking on a campaign to hold the Vice President accountablc [0 his lack
ofenvironmcntal leadership and his memory loss about global warming.
At numerous Gotc campaign events this fall, Free (llC Planet! mcmbcrs will
confront thtvrcc President and urge him to “read his book” and support
strong measures to curb global warming and clean tip our air

There is little doubt the Vice President understands CnVlfOnmk‘nml Is-
sues better than most political figures Unfortunately, his actual leadership
has been littlc more than writing a book, On an issue such as global watine
- ing, when action is critical, political figures such as the Vice President.
need to bc calling for action, rather than searching forcorporatCrsponsorcd
compromises.

Sincerely.

To the Editor.

l'd like to express my outrage and disgust at Elin Brandeis rcspons
(Letters 9/10/99) [0 Zorltn Milin’s Bluc Angcl movlt‘ rcview. Although
Ms, btiiidel proft to defend Germany from Ms, Milin’s slanderous
attack. the former merely ends tip perpetuating harmful stereotypes com
monly leveled at Gerriitiiiy in U 3. media, She describes Germany and its
cinema at hating a "pt'cllllilr beauty" although "They may not be lull of
humor or vigol "

she then rtillowt those rarnnrks with another etlinocentric and conde.
scending comment regarding German cinema: 'cerman ﬁlms are not
American ﬁlms. but don't blame that on the landscape " Arc we to believe
» do in fact exceed cernian films in humor, vigor and
maybe; even pccllliitl' beauty;

that Amcl lCclll liln

Ifwe. to accept this in is. then he also tti attribute this supcIi»
ority to something other than landscape. perhaps- some innate. divinelye
bestowed tiirrilrtyofu s hliiittiaiktrs that their :.erman counterparts lack?

Was this negation of her own supposed stance done inadvertantly or
could it be that she intended lieroyerill ftiriatically “American" message to
have an inrlueiice on the iender SUBLIMINALLY? Such morally outta
rionable propaganda tactics niustbeevposed to readers to that Ms, brandel‘s
attempt at spreading terror and esteridirig her influence does not remain
unopposed, And shame on the starlet at Black editors for allowing this
tool ofrnrrid control into their pages.

All the while. the tiermsn citizenry toils away in ahiect poverty and
humiliation in a land far away from the golden shores of Haiti and Brnzll
in tlie West. We, at privileged residents of the most powerful nationstate
rn-the world must now take a stand , omit the Mrlrris and thc Brandeis.
.wl'iose inappropriateslnndor only represent two slightly differing opinions
of the information elite. ,

We must reach out and lend uetmany a helping hand (a metaphorical
hand, though, b ~ I wotildri‘t wanna get close enough to toiicli‘any of
those fucking Nazu). -

Looking forward, '

Looking backward
Venugopal for Presidenl

By Dan Rothschild

The year has started at ctrnnell. once again, Grrnncllians have gone to
the polls, in droves that would embarrass states with cven the lowest of
vntcr turnouts, to elect their senators to serve on Joint Board.

Thus, we have perpetuated selfgovcrnance at Gtinncll another scmcs»
tcr. it is obvious that the Grinncll SGA is formed around the American
ideal of Federalist government. set up by the Constitution of the United
states some 2lo years ago. The ﬁrst American president elected under this
documcnt was George Washington, who 205 years ago this sunday, deliv.
ered a wclle-knOWn and ofteequomd specch known as his farewell address.
in It, he laid out certain cautions for posterity to follow in their search ofa
more perfect union,

But has our government kept to these ideals set forth so eloquently, yet
to simply, by America's great general?

Or has Washington, DC, run so amok in its debauchery and pork-
battel politics that it has forgotten the lessons laid out by thc man whose
namc it bears?

And most importantly. by Washington‘s reckoning, who is most ﬁt to
govern out nation,>

By cxccrpting his speech and contrasting itwith both Washington, Dc.
and Gtinnell, we scc that the student government ofa small Midwestcrn
college is actually much better suited to governance than the 535 men and
women who pass for our national legislative body on the swampy banks or
the mosquitoinfested Potomac River,

“it occurs as a matter ofscrious concern that any ground should
been furnished for characterizing patties by Geographical distri—
bution 7 Northern and Southern ,— Atlantic and Western; whence
designing men may endeavour to excite a belief that there is a real
difference oflocal interests and views.”

The United States was so fragmented on this issue that it fought a civil

beer or mati- juana is the
party drug of choice, no
such issue festcrs in Grinncll. Both North Campus and its southctn coun-
terpart coexist happily in SGA, The railroad is set where it always has been
and we can’t change that at this point. At thc lcast, we can make it KDIC’s
conduit to the test ofthc world in addition, tariffs are fat from an issue on
campus, largely since most people have little to no idea otwhat a tariffis
anyway

“However combinations or Associations.“ may now and then
answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and
things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious,
and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the Power of the
People... destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted
them to unjust dominion.”

Two political parties have dominated the American political landscape
for 140 years, with the exctption of Minnesota, which is an anomaly and
always has been. Grinnellians, on the other hand. have an attention span
roughly equivalent to that ofa pack ofcocainesnotting Chihuahuas. Wc
will never have to face the specter ofa coalition otour senators conspiring
to do much of anything, besides perpetuate the (Vet-papular (and grossly
unfair) student body pasttimc ofragging on Russell. At Grinnell, the only
parties we really care about happen Friday and Saturday nights.

“Sympathy for a favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an
imaginary common interest, in cases where no real common inter—
est exists... betrays [the nation] into a participation in the quarrels
and Wars of [another] ,..” a

The District of Columbia is a mess of international trade agreements
wrth names like NAFTA and GATT, with plums to be handed out to coun»
tries which either willingly accept our hegemony or have the potential to
blow us into a blue oblivion, At Gtinncll though, with ll1< exception ofthc
Fed Mall in Iowa City and some college in Cedar Rapids that shares its
name with the only pronoun still found in SGA‘s Constitution, we have no
concept that there it actually life outside our eightsquarcblock campus.
Occasionally some folks try to raise our consciousncss about a world issue
and they are usually met with blank states by people who think that Wal—
Matt is at the end ofthc earth. With no concept ofan outside world, there
is no threat that SGA would ever enter into a treaty with any other power,

So what conclusion must we draw? As Washington and the other found—
ing fathers would see it, our national government is in a state ofdisarray
beyond all repair, Thus, it is incumbent upon us to claim for Grinnell's
student Government Association the reigns ofpowet throughout the coune
try, It is you. Joint Boaud, that lives up to the Washingtonian ideal oftepte.
sentativc govcrnment. not the clowns in Congtcss. You shall match to the
Atlantic and install yourselves into your rightful place ofpowcrl The fate of
the nation is on your shoulders, SGA. only you can end our national suf.
fering.
