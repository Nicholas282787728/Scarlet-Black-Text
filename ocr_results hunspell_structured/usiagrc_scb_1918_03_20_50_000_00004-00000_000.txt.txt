War Effects Work In
Grinnell-Chlna Field

f

By A. ll. De Hahn ’06

The Grinnell-lll—Chiua ﬁeld is in
the province of shantung. It was in
this pr ’che that the Germans in 1898
under pretext of wanting indemnity
for the death of two German Catholic
priests seized the port of -Tsingtau.
They also wrung from China conces-

. sions which gave them first claim on
«he mining rights of the province and

' also the right to'lun‘ a thoroly equip-
ped German railroad into the hear of
the, province to the capital city, Tsin-
autu. ‘

In this capital city is located the
university in which Lyman Carly, Gri .
nell lsiu, already in China, will leach,
Grinnell plans to blue two more ,picn
supported by the G innell ' China
movement in this university. '

All these German rights and ounces»
sions and all the property of the Gal:
mans have been taken over by the dope
anese. who are holding them niitil the
final peace tcrms are settled,

.So far as the educational work of
our movement is concerned, it goes
ahead as planned, it remains for the
future to determine whether the Jana»
ncsc occupation or this ﬁeld will hc
permanent and so give Japan oppore
tunity for expansion of its interests, or
whether all this territory will be hands
ed back to the Chinese at the conellle
sion of the wa ii the Japanese re
main intrenched iu Shantung. then our
walk maybe scr usly affected.

and as a food. Hence there is a great
demand at the prsccnt time for fats
of all kinds, animal as well as vege-

“We need so little sugar in our
hon s of quiet and peace that we
shou d ﬁnd no fault with any of the

he continued. “Sevenl.y»ll\'c per cent
of the sugar u ed here in America is

Clal'ed Professor No ‘ .

In conclusion he sold, “Food conscr-

Some few adjustments are news

said to be seeking information as to
whether it would be cheaper to have a
tailor change the shape of his coat, or
on osteopatn change the shape of his

The men areifast learning to fasten
their "leggensl’ and thus avoid the
embarrassment of losulg them while
strolling across the campus; to keep
their hats on straign to tool at ease
in “too—short" sleeves; to breathe in
“too»tight" coats, and to walk in “too-
