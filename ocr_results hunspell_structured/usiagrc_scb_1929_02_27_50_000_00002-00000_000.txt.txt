CONSTRUCTIVE PREI’PING.

Spring brings to Grinnell besides the assurance of
warm breezes, bursting buds, and inevitable sloppy side-
walksia question. That question is just what status
will prepping have after Easter vacation. Favorable ac—
tion taken by student leaders on President Main‘s first
suggestion to limit hazing, as well as the cn-cperation
since given by the student body in restricting prepping,
would seem to indicate sentiment in favor of its choir
.tion. '

However the matter has not been conclusively tested.
It has been an art of the Gl‘innell tradition to regard that
period falling between Christmas and Spring vacations
as a sort of “closed season" on freshmanrbaiting. Dur-
ing that time, prep caps have been laid away find paddle
parties, while not entirely limited have been considered
somewhat of a tradition-poaching. But the lifting of the
ban has been the automatic accompaniment of the March
recess and in the month foliowin hazing has flourished
with all the vigor of a sport during its “open season."

thether such Will be the case this year remains to
be seen. It is our opinion that rather than have proh-
ping restored on the scale of former years, it would be
preierable to eliminate it entirely. This course would
mean that all the henclits of the system as well as its
evils would be thrown into the discard.

That prepping has a constructive side cannot, we

college life will be an important one.

think be denier] even by its critics. ltdoesgive college
a ﬂavor of its own, 4 personality which makes the in-
stitutiull something more than an educational iactory.
When John Jones, the normal American boy, locks up
from the pages of his “Frank Merriwell," and dreams of
Ills future college career. the football iicld and campus
life take precedence in that dream, Somewhere in the
background, he may throw in a library, a clussroom,und
a few books, with the thought, "just to make things look
regular," but his eye is caught by the glamorous give and
take at the college campus. He may conceivably hold to
that idea through high school and be lured along to fur»
ther cducction by this naive notion. But assuming him
to be normal, he should have evulved past that stage he-
fcro graduation. Hazing, then, has value as [lfirt oi the
sugar coating which has tempted our Joncscs to taste the
pills of wisdom.

Prepping, bowcvcr. has not fulfilled its duty in help
ing to attract youth ccllcgsuard. It operates througlu
out the Jonescs’ first year in welding them togctlicr.
History has shown that men have been drown together
not so often through common mstcs as commeu enlllitles
and the desire for protection. so when the lroslr hnd
themselves in a new enviromnent dreading the assault
of that tel '1112 college ogre, the sophomore, they tend to
link hands with each other as confidingly as the "babes
in the wood.” strong friendships, then, may be the by-
product of hazing.

We have now taken Jones past his odolcsccnt trust-
ful stage. He knows the way to A. R. H. and the Admin
istration building. He can tell you that candyluml is
a confectionery shop, He may even, if an observing
frosh, be able to name the street on “Melt the dol'lllir
torics are situated, Now comes a natural desire in him
to show people what s knowing person he is. Hence
Hell week. This period Mful‘ds an outlet for a natural
desire, not confined to college freshmen, for self exhihr
tion. instead, however, of the props breaking into the
limelight by some act of individual folly, he Illa): the
clown in cm organized communi ,- way. He may be one
of a regiment of stublomon or zouuves marching down
the center of Paris street before a buttery of eyes, or
upon him may have been imposed the humbler duty of
borrowing a dollar from a prof. Nevertheless whatever
indiscrstioh he may have committed, he need not kick
himself so severely the morning after, tor the responsi-
bility was not his. Besides he can be comforted by what
psychologists call a “sharing of the burden” with fair
low offenders. Thus the excess egc lending to selfrdis-
play is taken care of in a Way which will cause the least
regret afterwards.

Tile growth of ego in the fresh at this period may
have reached the stage of “cockiuess.” In this case
menial duties, humiliating stunts, and fatherly advice
may help. Kinks in his character may be ironed out by
presenting him to himself as others see him. Or if he is
of an opposite type; shy, retiring, atraid to face life, the
imposition of tasks designed to bring him into the lime-
light so that he may lose his tear of it, the compulsion
placed upon him to associate with his fellows if only at
paddle parties, may help him to fit in, to leap over sells
imposed obstacles.

This, we cannot help feeling, was what hazing when
instituted was intended to do. However like other of the
“best laid plans of mice and men" it would seem to have
gone astray. “‘hether it can ever be replaced in its
proper groove wll depend on the flexibility of nppcrclass
oinion. If sophomores, juniors, and seniors, can be
brought around to the belief that prepping is a responsi-
bility rather than a. convenience, a test of their own
character rather than of the freshmen, a system in which
they must give rather than take, the place of hazing in

In view of the present condition of

administration a few
and rclici measures:

1. Change the “Y" building to a
boat house cud rent canoes by the

3. Ferry service from A. R. H.
to the Varsity Tea Room. (Think
of the terrible gurglc us Peg
Thompson went down for the third
time after slipping off the curb.)

4. Life pr-esorvers to be hung at
all street corners to be thrown to
the poor unfortunates who didn't
fare as well as Eliza in crossing on
the ice.

5. cough syrup to be served at
tile Dorms and Quud instead of
coffee. (The sustitution would
hardly bu noticeable anyhow.)
