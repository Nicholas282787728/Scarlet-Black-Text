Corps tours Iowa

Grinnell’s new photography club advocates adventure

BYREBECCA POWELL AND
MANDY FASSETT

When Lucy Schiller '09 returned to
Grinnell from studying abroad in Den-
marlt, she brought back a newround pas-
sion for photojournalism. In Denmark,
Schiller immersed herselfin a photography
class and found that the creation of photo
essays and the pursuit of connections with
her subjects inspired a new appreciation for
picture takingr

When Schiller found that Lawrence
Surnulong '09, who works as the photo edi»
tor on the sous, had a similar interest in
photojournalism, she asked him if he'd be
interested in forming a group on campus.

They had their first meeting at SClill’
ler’s apartment on Main Street last Thurs
day evening, “I was really nervous, because
i thought no one was going to show up,"
Schiller said. “But I was pleasantly sure
prised with the amount of people that
came and the amount ofinrercst that was
displayed”

Ar the meeting, the two founders talk-
ed with the group of roughly tcn students
about their plans to create an “involved
community” of photographers. The group
brainstormed about various places in the
Iowa community to begin their photo 35,
sa rs.

)“At Grinncll there isn't much ofa framt?
worls set up for working with liltearnlnded,
phorographically»minded people," Schiller
said. “There’s a dark room, but that's more
ofa space to develop your own images rath—
er than brainstorm with other people who
want to pursue similar things,"

Schiller's biggest interest lies in a long
term project documenting the community
of l’ostville, lowar Posrville was the location
of the largest workplace immigration raid
in Iowa history.

Others contributed ideas for Grinnell
specific projects like the Friday Fest that

took place in downtown Grinnell last Fri—
day, and a tomato tasting at Heritage Farms
on Sunday. Larger project ideas included a
trip to CERA, Grinnell’s prairie iesearch
center and documentation of dwindling
small farming towns and areas affected by

thc spring floods.

The group plans to meet once a week
in smaller groups to review their work and
do most of the larger shooting projects on
the wcckcnd. Group members have dis-
cussed the possibility of renting cameras
from the AV center for those members
without equipment so that everyone could
participate. The group is hoping to display
then finished projects in the Joe Rosenfeld
Cénter, Saint's Rest and other areas around

campus and the town ofcrinnell,

Through Photojournalism corps, Schil—
ler and Sumulong hope to create a com»
munity or photojournalists from all back-
grounds and levels of experience. Andrew
Kishman '10, who attended the meeting on
Thursday, is fairly new to photography.

“I haven‘t even really taken photos serir
ously before, but i lived with Lucy (Schilr
let) this summer and I saw her take a lot of
photos, and we talked about it, and I guess

I'm really interested," Kishman said,

Through their desire to provide an are
tistic community to photographers of all
levels and abilities, Schiller and Sumulong
have brought a new opportunity for stu-
dents to express themselves through pic-
tures and become more in touch with the

greater Iowa community.

New intro marks Art Major changes

BY Elea LEAs

Upperclassrnen at Grinnell may no longer recognize
the Art Department's page in this year's academic catalog.

As changes have come to the major
requirements, the lnost conspicuous
difference is the lack of introduc—
tory courses. There is now only one
introduction that all students must
take. and it is a prerequisite for all
other studio art classes.

“[Tlie new approach will] change
for the better the quality of art edu-
cation that the school can provide,"
Alex Schcchter’lO, a member ofthe
Art department’s SEPC, sold. “The
old intro classes may have been
daunting,"

dio,

”[lne dais] r5 a combination of a Wide
range of media and technique, inc/ud-
rng drawing, color theory, form [near/v,
tompossion, {wordemerrrlona/ and
three-demenrronn/ study ”

Alex Schechter '10

Intro to the studio is meant to be a lot more conceptual,"
Maya Ruiz-stanbury '11 said.

“[The class is] a combination ofa
wide range of media and techniques,
including drawing. color theory, for-m
theory. composition, two-dimen-
sional and three-dimensional study,"
Schechter said.

The changes are intended to ad
dress the previous system’s inefﬁcient
cies in terms ofl)readth,Tl-lis “founr
datlon" course is designed to “give
students a basic media approach and
a wide [art] vocabulary," Matthew
Klubcr, Arr, said.

Students who tools on old intro

with a wide range of skill and familiarity levels. Now, stu-
dents will learn rhc basic processes for all of the disciplines,
and begin llppcrrlcvcl courses "on the same page," Kluber
said.

The new system is better tailored to the resources of
Grilmcll’s small art department, while minimizing repetition
by still providing students with a range of artistic mediums
to work within.

Introduction to the studio is now a requirement for
the Art major, but Kluber and the Art Department worked
carefully with the registrai to ensure that students who had
completed the old, specialized introductory classes would
not be required to take the new version, However, “some up-
peiclassmen have opted to take it anyway," Klubcr said.

“Students seem to be enthused about the new class,”
Schccter said. And a wide range of second and third years
have elected to take it.

“I definitely like the idea,” Susanna Moller '12, who is
in Introduction to the Studio, said. “but I've only had [the
class] three or four times,”

The art department has reconfigured the old introduc-
tory lineup of classes such as sculpture and print-making
into this single, essential coursc— Introduction to the srur

class completed the prerequisite foi all zoorlevel couises, but
weic only well prepaied for the specific medium they had
studied. Teachers of zoorlevel cnurscs then had to conrcnd

No really, an. ille beer is mad cheap.
