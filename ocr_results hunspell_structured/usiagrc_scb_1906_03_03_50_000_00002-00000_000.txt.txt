HIS is the season ofbhoyeur when
the oily tongued representative
of s o m is publishing concern ap-
pears in our midst and begins his
campaign among the students. He
invariably represents, so he says, the
biggest, best, and most generous com-
pany doing business in this muntry Or
any other, and the proposition which
he offers is nothing short of marvel-
lous, even Solomon in all his glory
would not hesitate to accept the prop-
osition. In the course of the cam-
pnign students receive written invita-
tlonsto meet the gentleman at the
hotel and there the student, usually
falls an easy mark to the luring in-
ducements which are oﬂered,

The student is probably earning his
way through college and is anxious to
earn a goodly sum during the summer
vacation. The green goods man ﬁnds
‘Out the circumstances of his Victim
and immediately assures him that he
hasa proposition which is a winner
1mm the word go. A number or letters
-3re read from successful guitars and
by a little persuasion the imagination
'01 the student is stretched to such an
extent that he has visions of himself
becoming a plutocrat and a. money
lender at the close of the season. The
student is assured that selling books
is an easy matter, the only thing nec~
essary is to learn the inspirational
canvass and out commencement be-
eause grarters are many and the vic-
tims are few, and the danger irom ir-
ate housewives and canine pups is less
earlier in the season than later. The
student is also reminded that Grant,
Napoleon and several other celebrities
once sold books, and the inference is
that a successful book agent :Llwztys
becomes famous and may Command
armies or sway o npires.

As a result of the persuasive tally,
tlle student signs a cohtlact for eight,
ten, or even twelve weeks and pays
his hard earned com for his Outﬁt or,
what is worse, signs It note which he
comes due just at the time when he
cam least alien} to pztyr College closes
and the student starts out perhaps
for an adjoining County or Just its like-
ly to a. distant state where he begins

or two \Vee'rs he discovers mills sor-
row that people can be “fooled part or
the time but not all the time” and
when ﬁnally he becomes ﬁnancially
embarasserl and discouraged he throws
up the job, beats his way home, and
goesto Work at something which pays

the same old story, it he

THE CORNELLXAN ANSWERED.

The Cornellian of January Gth cone
tuined the following extract: “A poor
excuse ior not debating Cornell again
isbetter than none." On alittleinres-
tigdtiuh SCARLET Axu BLACK is able
to show that one of the chief reasons
why there is no Grinnell-Curnell de-
bate this year is due to the refusal oi
Cornell to enter into the systern pro-
posed by Grinuell. Cornell might
have had two intercollegiate debates,
had she so desired and would have
been saved a. lot of trouble Grinuell
refused to debate under the old sys-
tem; Cornell refused the new. Now,
whose fault is it that Cornell is Oblig-
ed to seek an opponent outside the
state? The following letter is self
explanatory:

Mt. Vernon, Iowa, May 26, 1905.
Mr. Harry L Worth,

Dear Sir:70ur league met. today
and instructed me to write that we
could not accepta triangular debate
with or without. Ames. We received
a letter recently from Carlton favor-
ing a quadrangular league including
Carleton, Beloit, Cornell, and Grin-
11911. We should like to carry this
plan out. We however have two bids
already for single debates, and unless
Grinnell favors either a. single debate,
or the quadrangular debate, we can
not debate Yours respeettully,

Miner Earwaod,
Sec. Cr D. L.
