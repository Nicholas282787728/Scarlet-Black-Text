is un‘rtlltTUMTli CIRCUMSTANDE ,

Uiidcr pr scrrt conditions, the diitsrcuccs in vacation
dates at our ini-ious cducntrcpnl institutions tend, in
iriririy instances, more toward inmily disiinion than
rcunioii. The conﬂict between Easter vncutions and
iiitcr-oiidrtcr vacntioris is iiniortunnte.

The \ cntion periods oi many schools are just close
enough to tulltal" e the students and prevent the holding
oi successful activities. Many students have to spend
the vocation without their special iriends.

There is no present solution to the case. We can-
not expect tlic moon, which decides the Easter date, to
clinngc its usual rate. The Iluiversity needs a week
{or adjustments between terms, no matter when one
ends.

that a. similar condition exists here.

tute For Fraternities ls'
‘ Sought by Students at Syracuse I!

 

 

(The row Stllllellt)

A blow at fraternities, hnclgd by the
administration and supported by Out-
side ﬁnancial aid, which may result
in their extinction on the gym se
uniVel' ty campus, was struck there
recently. ,

Declaring that irsiernal groups as
they exist in American colleges at
present, are antiquated and a remnant
of a medieval age of education, organ-
ization of it Student Union Of several
thousand members is announced.

Hold Secret ueetiiirss

Three months of secrat meetings b0-
tWeen administrative authorities and
l‘elll'esentative neutral students have
preceded this move" Fraternities and
soror’itics are in an upronr over the
impending danger to their social stat-
us.

iThe chief aim of the new organiza-
tion is to give the neutral students the
social life and other campus privileges
now enjoyed only by members oi the
fraternal groups, who form approxi-
mately it third of the entire student
body.

‘ The Union's first concern is the as»
tablishment of a central building
where ,coseds can gather between
classes to Study or lounge dull‘chztt
without being disturbed by the Ingle
half of the student group. This will
