PardOn Me, Is that the
Grinnell Choo-Choo?

By Jenny Halcrow

I’ve been interested in trains ever since I
got one oi niose Fisher Price trains, the
kind that were painted red, blue and
yellow, with the people who had a peg {or a
body and a round wooden head.

Although today railroads and trains are
more likely to be a snap together set or
tracks and an electric toy under the
Christmas tree. they used to be a major
transportation and freight hauling 'link
across the United States.

The size of the railroad industry is made
plain by the tracks that divide Grinnell’s
campus.

Trains were not an unplanned transpor-
tation link in Grinnell, Because of it’s cen-
tral location. “IE. Grinnell founded the
town with the expectation that a railroad
would go through here” said Bill
Deminoff, Secretary of the College.

In 1855, the Rock Island Line laid tracks
lrom Davenport towards Grinnell and the
tirst train came through Grillllell in July
1863. Along With the tracks goes a depot
built in 1893.

The depot is located on 3rd Avenue and
Park Street. which is close to where J B.
Grinnell lived. “The building is a modilied
Queen Anne style, characterized by a
single tower”. according to Deminoﬂ'

The building was erected by a Mar»
shalltown firm and is “in excellent shape.
it’s really sound structurally", said
Deminoif.

In addition to being “absolutely the main
link in and out of town ior college
students", the train brought several
Iormer U.S. Presidents to town; Wilson,
Hoover, Eisenhower and Truman all came
to Grinnell on passenger trains, Deminoil
said.

Al Pinder, owner and editor of the Grins
nell HeraldrRegister. rode the trains fre-
quently and remembers “dining on those
trains was just super. There were fresh
ﬂowers and silver on every table." Pinder
added, “the bar car was good, too,”

Pinder rode the train to Chicago often
because “it was the only way to get to
Chicago . i . it was cheaper than driving

and the station [in Chicago] was right on
the Loop . . i so you went to a Loop hotel.
Beiore the interstates, driving to Chicago
was a day-long adventure“, Finder
reminisced,

For those who had business meetings in
Chicago, a train lelt Grinnell at r A,M., are
riving in Chicago at l P.M., then there was
a return train at o p M. that got back to
Grinnell beiore midnight, said Pinder.
“There was also a ‘milk train’ that left
Grinnell at 2:30 or 3 AM, and then you
would have the whole day in Chicago",
continued Finder.

The estimated cost oi riding the train to
Chicago in the late 1950’s and early 1960's

was 12 to 15 dollars.

Another train that went through Grinnell
was the “Doodle Bug” that was on the
MinneapolsVSt, Louis Railway. Plnder said
“the train would come through and whistle
during the [Pioneer's iootballl games.”

Roger Zimmerman, a Grinnell alumnus
of 1955, remembers picking up the
mallbags at 4 A.M, and taking them to the
post office, where he worked his way
through college,

Another Grinnell alumnus James Nor-
man Hall, author of Mutiny On The Boun-
ty. reportedly jumped a ireight train train
Colfax. Iowa to Grinnell to see the college.
He liked it so well, he went to school here,
said Al Pinder.

tion, the railroad was gradually phased out
of existence in Grinnell. Finder Said in 1970
when the Rock Island “originally was go-
ing to take one train all [the route]. we
were furious."

Finder and other Grinnell residents
were surprised by the lack of resistance
the Des Moines Commerce Commission
put up to the discontinuation oi train ser-
vice in and out of Grinnell. Pinder testified
before the Commerce Commission in Des
Moines on behalf of the railroad service
and “I think that I got the man asking the
questions a little angry because I didn’t
answer his questlons yes or no”, Finder
said. -

In the May 28, 1970 edition of The Grin»
nell Herald-Reigster, an article titled
“Grinnell to Lose Passenger Trains” said
that the Interstate Commerce Commission
approved the discontinuation oi the Rock
Island rail lines numbers 7 and 10 on May
26. 1970 and passenger service would stop
May 31

The article continued, "all OAK oiiiclal
said |he decision to terminate the trains ,.
.wzls due to the (act that material Submit-
led by the railroad ‘sllows that even if all
doubts as to the trains’ patronage. revenue
prospects and costs were resolved against
Rock Island, an unavoidable loss ol more
than a million dollars a year is being sus-
tained by the two trains."

Although passenger trains are not likely
to come through Grinnell agaln. interest in
the old depot is resurfacmg. Bill Deminoti
said at one time the building was con-
Sldered as a location for an industrial and
agricultural museum,

Other ideas for the building bandied
about by the Grinnell 2000 Foundation
have been a restaurant, a local night spot
or place ior teenagers, said Ben Webb,
director of the Grinnell 2000 Foundation,

The building has recently been purchas-
ed by a private individual and the future of
the depot remains to be seen.

Grinnell’s
Nightlife

By Sylvia Bachmann

Early morning bakery runs -have
become a tradition and a saving grace for
GRINNELL Students over the years. Late-
night studiers and insomniacs alike relish
the 2:00 hour when the back door of
Hansen’s Bakery (The Danish Maid
Bakery) opens tor the students. Many
manage to hold out until around 3:30 A.M.
when fresh donuts, rolls, and assorted
other energizing foods skirt coming out of
the ovens. The hours may seem irregular,
but the waiting cream-filled longjohns and
pecan rolls make the excursion in the dead
oi night well worth it.

Then, too, consider the baker. Bill
Hansen, owner of the Bakery, works
through the night, every night except
Saturdays. What better reason to make a
bakery run than to prove that GRINNELL
really does have a night life i i i at least at
the Bakery.

For those who consider sleep more im
portant than donuts on school nights, Fri-
day night runs are very satisiying rewards
at the end of a hard week. (And of course
