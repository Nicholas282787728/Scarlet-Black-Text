O Grinnell Forges Ahead

With the inaugural ceremony yesterday,
Dr. Samuel N". Stevens formally assumed
the administration of Grinnell College. Al-
though the dignified service precluded any
put the politest demonstrations of enthus—
iasm, a staunch undercurrent of congratu—
lation, both for the man and the college,
was noticeably present.

And that is as it should be. For with—
out this good feeling the aspirations for
Grinnell evillced throughout the inaugura-
tion would be impossible of fulfillment. No
one person, however able, can accomplish
large tasks without cooperation. And co-
operation is at its best only when it stems
from enthusiastic good feeling.

Even with sllcll support the road of
progress may he often obstructed. Ull-
doubtedly, the way will be encumbered with
criticism, perhaps undeserved. For new
paths are strange paths, and there are many
who would adhere to the old and familiar.
Yet, we have reason to believe that these
obstacles Will delay our promised progress
only minutely.

Hence, we join the chorus of congratu»
lation. We, too, say: Dr. Stevens, carry
on. We’re for you 100 per cent!

and often superficial. Occasionally it is dif-
ficult to submit to their will w bent an
annoying consciousness of sophisticated hye
procrisy. Especially is this true in certain
instances where usage had declared a heart
warming \ elcome indispensable.

This is not such an occasion.

For, established though it may be in the
annals of the Scarlet and Black, our \lel-
come to you, the alumni and friends who
have returned for the yearly Homecoming,
is founded on a base for more elldllrillg
than custom. It is rooted in the genuine
pleasure we take in seeing familiar faces
come back to familiar paths—and ill the
happiness we are cetrain you find ill that
return.

We welcome you backibnck to "Old
Grinnell," different in some respects, per-
haps, but fundamentally still unchanged.
For it is of enduring stuff that the customs
of Grinnell are fashioned. Thus it is that
we say welcome back~welcome back to a
great institution founded on great Dl’lllch
ples and steeped in great traditions.

Alumni and friends, we welcome you.
Grinnell welcomes you. Won’t you accept
our hospitality?

C On Grinnelll

A worthwhile tradition that has been re—
vived this year is that everybody goes to
the Gl-illllell football games, at least when
played on the home field. Undoubtedly, the
reason for this change is that the Pioneers
have consistently been playing a brand of
football that leaves no doubt in the spec-
tators minds that the team gave all they
had, will or lose.

The scarlet and black has this year won
two and lost two of their games, all the
games b‘ llg good examples of football and
the old college try. Spirit at the two games
has been at a highepitch and the stands
have been packed.

Tomorrow the Pioneers play the Cor-
nell college eleven, their third Midwest coll-
Terence tiltithe Homecoming game. We
do not know whethel the Pioneers can win,
but we know it will be a good game.

' There is no doubt that the team will COD-
tlnue to put everything into the garlic, bllt
whether injuries to squad members has
been sufficient to allow the Cornell squad
to dump Grinnell ollt of the conference lead
as they did to Coe last week remains to be
seen.

Grinnell has not won a homecoming
game since 1931, but if there is any u" y to
break the jinx this year, we feel conl dent

that Bell Douglas‘ Pioneers u‘ill discovel
that way tomorrow.

Urge Early Attendance

To the Editor:

I wish to avail myself to the
columns of your good paper to
thank the student body and com-
pliment them on the success of
the carnival held in the gymnase
ium for the benefit of the new
physical education unit.

I have received a check from
the Student Council totaling
5121.50 which is the net profit. I
cannot tell you how happy the
success of this purely stutleht con—
ceived, promoted, and managed
enterprise has made us and how
proud wc were at Minneapolis last
week when we told 105 Grinnell
alumni how the student body was
supportlng this project. Many
thanks to all of yoli,
