Census officials plan to target college students this year

S u be Bire d a
STANFORD, Calif.

In addition to minorities, the poor. the
homeless, and children, college students are
among the most undercountcd individuals by
census workers.

college students are particularly dimcuit
to count because of their multiple addresses
and low census questionnaire response rates.

This year, the Census Bureau is hoping to
curb iniseounts and iindcrcounts by embark—
ing on an ambitious program ofcommunity
partnerships and outreach,

"This is ihe first time the Census Bureau
has made partnerships on a mass scale... they
have taken outreach to an unprecedented
level," said census analyst and Stanford Soci»
ology Prof. Matt Snipp.

In addition to paid advertisements and
newly formed Complete Count Committees,
local census oihcials plan to aggressively at.
tack the problem ofundercounting on many
college campuses.

Phil Matthews, assistant manager for rc—
cruitlng in the Sunnyvale Census 2000 office.
said his omce is Workingwitll various students
groups, fraternities and sororities to heighten
awareness among Stanford students. The of»
ﬁce will also attend several basketball games
to distribute information about the census, as
well as recruit students to be ﬁeld counters.

Field counters make about $15.50 an hour
and census ofﬁce workers earn about $l 175

an hour.

Santa Clara government ofﬁcials estimate
that roughly 9.5 to 10 percent oi the
undercoiint in the last census originated in
unincorporated county areas like staniord.
because census ﬁgures are used to decide how
Federal funding isdistributed, theeounryloses
money {or every student not counted.

pert Kuiras, the assistant county executive
for santa Clara county estimated that the
county lost between $60 million and $130
million in funding over the past 10 years due
to an approximate iindercount of 40,000
people in the 1990 census.

“The census bureau has told us the real is.
sue is not the [undercountl orthe dorm popu»
lation but the students who are livingaffcam-
pus or in group settings where one person may
not ﬁll out the form for all the people living
in the house," he said.

Kutras said the county has formed part-
nerships with stanrotd administrators and
ASSU President Mike Levin.

"We wish to be as helphil as possible. We
know that Stanford is a complex institution
and knowing who to go to is difficult,“ said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
James Montoya. "That is why we are currently
in conversation with the census Bureau."

The Census bureau has expressed a strong
interest in having stanrord administrators help
recruit student workers for the bureau,
Montoya said.

"We‘re open to any conversation that
would help provide a more accurate count,"
he continued.

because Federal research funding and ﬁ
naneial aid dollars are not dependent on cane
sus counts ofstanrord‘s student population.
the University is not directly arrested by can»
sus results, .

student counts are still important, how.
ever, according to Matthews.

"The student population impacts the
fundingfor thesurrounding community . the
way things are governed and funds are alien
cared," he said.

census results are used to determine con»
gressional district boundaries and federal rund-
ing distribution. in addition, many students
beneﬁt from federal dollars allocated to the
area For services like public transportation,
highways and hospitals.

undercounts result in a loss ofrunding for
the county, which mayresultin decreased ser-
vices for the area.

The biggest cause ofundercountlng is in-
dividuals failing to respond to the census mail.
ing, a census 2000 public information oil“-
cial said. From 1970 to 1990. census response
rates dropped {mm 78 to as percent.

Low response rates have forced the Federal
government to spend $225 million dollars to
hire ﬁeld counters. students will receive a cen—
sus form ifthey have a city address. If they do
not fill out the form, a counter will be sent to

their residence, Sending a counter to a resi-
dence costs aboutclght times as much as mail.
ing a census form.

snipp cnccuraged studeno to take the tens
sus seriously,

"The census is a civic responsibility, like
voting. The consequences a are bit less obvir
ous, but itdoesimpactcommunities,and iris
your way ofmaklng sure you are represented,"
he said.

Collcgc students are the subjects ormany
reports and proﬁles published by the Ccnsus
Bureau. The number orstudcnts on ﬁnancial
aid as well as the number erminority college
students are available from the Census bureau

The feelings orstanrord students vary on
the census issue. Junior Daniel Lipkin said, "I
don't think people care about the census. They
should know more about politics in general."

Lipkin added that he would work as a ccns
sus counter.

Freshman jamila Webb felt she knew little
about the census but said she would ﬁll it out
"as her duty as a black person in America."

Census Formswill be mailed on March 15.
census 2000 workers have been working for
months and will continue to work well into
next year to make sure an accurate count is
taken. Through outreach, advertisements (one
ofthe first premiered during the super Bowl),
and hiring student counters, the Census Bu—
reau hopes to make this census the most ac.
curate cvcr.
