Taylor and Duke Next In Line For
High Total — Kitchen Steps
440 In Fast Time.

The yeal'lii'igs cor ed on the hon-
ors in the annual track and ﬁeld meet
between the Sophomores and Fresh-
men which was held on Ward Field
last Saturday afternoon, the ﬁrst year
men winning by .1 score of 72% to
541/3. Critchett was indilidual point
winner of the meet while Taylor and
Duke followed in the number or points
scored in the order named. A strong
south wind slowed up considerably
the races especially the short dashes
but the track was in good condition.

Critchett, who showed up well in
the home meet last spring, took ﬁrsts
in the jhvelin, the shotput, and the
pole vault in addition to seconds in
the broad jump and discus for a total
of 21 points. Taylor, a freshman
from Sioux City. captured. the broad
jump and both hurdles as well as l)”
ing for ﬁrst in the high jump. Tays
lor with 1m points was lollowed by
Duke with 13% points. Benedict, aI
sophomore, furnished the feature run
of the meet in the two mile pace by
walking until his competitors ap-

roached, when he would start run-
ning until he gained a suflicient lead
to again walk.

The fastest time of the meet ‘was
made by Kitchen when he stepped the
44 yard dash in 51 2 5. Kitchen was
closely pushed by Melli-ath in this lace I
