If You Smoke, Don’t Drive!

by Jack Doppelt

According to the evel-present monr
itor or mankind, the statistic, ii you
smoke a cigarette you are twice
as prone to be involved in an auto
accident than someone who never
touches the stuff.

That was the conclusion drawn by
Columbia University researchers in
men. As a result, non~smoking pol-
icyholders of the Farmer Insurance
Group will save $30 to $50 a year,
“effective immediately" (to coin
Dean Walker)

Other companies are certain to
iollow, as they have concerning
student rates, good driver discounts,
driver training rates, and grade
point average beneﬁts. Now, I bear
no grudge because as things have
gone, I qualify ior all those disr
counts.

I just hate insurance companies,
plain and simple and totally obJeCr
tive. Not because of the principle
oi betting against yourself. Not be
cause oi the industry’s asinine com-
mercials. Not because the industry

ding bearing its name in every city

But because they've got you right
where they want you, right behind
the wheel.

The categorical discriminations
employed by insurance iirms to de-
termine which characterist' s der
note sate security risks ori noted
with mortality tables. They fore-
cast when you should be dying it
you are normal.

The insurance companies have it
rigged so that the more susceptible
you are to death, fire, theft, or ac-
cident, the more they’ll choke out
of you. All societal institutions and
all levels of human interaction
should exist on that principle.

Opticians should charge {our times
as much ior people who need glasr
ses to see than for those with 207
20 vision. The worse your eyes get,
the more you pay.

Shoe salesmen should look at the
condition of the shoes a customer
is wearing. li they are in miserable
shape, with more holes than lea—
ther, he should charge $30. For
anyone who lust needs a second
pair, the salesman should only ask
for $10.

That way, people would buy shoes
when they don’t need them just to
circumvent the exorbitant price
when they rally do need them.That’s
why insurance salesmen recommend
that you buy a policy right in the
middle oi your marriage vow.

And it someone needs change to

til Bell used the excuse that the
millions of delinquent calls forced
it to raise its rates.

Parke Godwin of the Farmers Ins
surance Group Said that although
there were no immediate plans ior
increasing premiums on smokers,
”the rates will have to go up on
one group it they go down on anot-
her,” Put that in your stogy and
smoke it.

it makes me ieel quite guilty to
realize that those interior, ignom-
lnious drivers who can't claim a
3.0 average are paying out of their
ears because my skillful driving
is reflected by my grade point,

I’m sure it wouldn’t take too much
for insurance firms to statistically
display that women or people under
five feet six inches or people with
obstructive noses are greater
security risks than their counter-
parts.

That would deiinitely be more log-
ical and enforceable than distin-
gusihing between smokers and non—
smokers,

What this country will soon wit—
ness is the most profound increase

An‘Adequate Energy Supply

by Fran cutler

Recently, the lowa Confederation oi
Environmental Organizations
(lCEO), a statewide coalition oi en.
vironmental groups, released a
statement concerning the Midwest
Governor’s Conference on Energy
and Environment. This statement
is worthy oi attention in that is pram

ernor nay ior both his iirm grasp

Birnbaum: Administration Power

To the Editors:

The atmosphere which prevailed
at the “Deans’ Open Forum" last
week was an alarming one. it the
hostile attitudes of the students
present were disturbing to Dean
Walker, the condescending attitude
of the Administration toward the
student body, as projected by the
Dean, was no less disturbing,

The problem lies deeper than the
immediate issue oi the limitation
oi independent projects Fitteen
months ago students in desperation
called a mass meeting iocused on
the issue at ”academic pressure",
in reaction to an emotionally re-
pressive environmentthat had grown
to an intolerable point on the Grinr
nell campus. Their only recourse
was to plead to the sensibilities oi
iaculty and administration ior help
in lessening the burden The situ-
ation was eased, but the essence oi
the matter was that the student
body, when overburdened, had to
rely solely on the goodwill and
mercy oi those in charge. Now
we are told that independent proA
jects must be limited to relieve
the burden on the iaculty, and im—
mediately the proposal becomes the

rulenwithout the slightest semb-
lance oi democratic procedure.

The power relationship inherent
here makes a mockery of the no-
tion that the College is a “con-l»
munity” comprised of faculty, ad—
ministration, and students. All this
has been said many times beiore,
but needs saying again, Decisions
in which the students have no say
are handed down by a “benevolent"
hierarchy that somehow "knows
what is best”. Once again, the tact
has reared its ugly head to con-
front us,

The appalling thing is that nothing
is being done to counteract whzit is
decidedly n regression in an educa—
tional institution that Once was be
ginning to experiment and innovate.
Last year credilrfail grades were
ingloriously ended after an all-too-
short life, At the present rate, I
would not be surprised ii required
courses are reinstated withili the
next two years.

This need not happen. We oi the
student body can, and must, demon-
strate the responsibility and mi—
tiative needed {or educational Change

now.

Sahara: T

by Scott Mason

McCoy Tyner is unquestionablyone
oi the most important pianists to
have emerged irom the early Sixe
ties, and his latest Milestone album,
Sahara, gives him great promise
ior the iuture, This is probably
his best album since his first solo
effort on Eluenote, TheRealMcCoy,
and features his current working
quartet oi Sonny Fortune on sop-
rano, alto, and flute, Calvin Hill
on bass, and Alphonse Mouzon, for»
merly with Weather Report, on dr-
ums. Fortune provides a strong solo
Voice to balance Tyner, and his
work on soprano is in places highr
ly derivitive of Coltrane, alternat»
ing shrieks, flutters, and trills with
extended modal runs. Mouzon is tec»
hnically superb, and drives the rhy-
thm with demonic intensity, though
he is reportedly overbearing in live
performance. Hill is generally sol—
id on bass, though occasionally one
feels that he leans too heavily on
Mouzon ior support Generally the
quartet is very together, even
ilashy, in ensemble periormance.
“Ebony Queen," which is the
group’s theme song, opens side one

The [CEO is especially pleased
that Ray concluded his address be-
fore the Conierence with the stated
objective oi delivering “adequate
power supplies and concurrently
protecting the environment.” in the
view of the lCEO, Ray’s use oi the
word “adequate" is crucial because
it draws the distinction between
what amount oi energy our nation
needs and what amounts it is will-
ing to buy.

However, in spite oi Ray's com-
mendable attitude, the lCEO was
disappointed in the prevalence oia
”business as usual” attitude on the
part oi many participants. Although
Governor nay implied in his con-
cluding statement that our nation’s
energy demands were elastic, the
malorily oi the participants were
preoccupied merely with supplying
the market with an adequate energy
supply, getting their fail‘ share oi
that market, and thus disregarding
the use oi economic forces is a
means of restraining the energy de-
mand.

In its report, the ICEO contends
that an adequate supply ol power
can he made available to society
while protecting our environment
only if we recognize that the de
mand tor energy is elastic and thus
allow economic i’orccs to operate
on energy demand as well n5 energy
supply. In justifying its recommell»
dation, the lCEO points out that in the
US where gasoline costs 40¢ per
gallon, families tend to own two
cars, each of which travels 12 miles
per gallon llowever, in Europe,

North Lounge reverberated to the sound of rock late last Saturday night.

strongly The relatively simple
theme is repeated again and again
until it soars, and then launches
immediately into an impressive solo
irom Fortune. The rhythmic inter-
play between drums and sax builds
up tremendous tension that is re
lieved momentarily beiore Tyner

launches into an unbelievable two
handed solo. it is rare that a pian-
ist has the sheer lonal brilliance
to follow a blistering horn passage,
yet McCoy accomplishes this With
ease, taking the piece to new emor
tional heights.

“a Prayer For My Family,"which

to advantage both the amazing tec-
hnique and stylistic individuality
possessed by Tyner. He hasatouch,
a sound that is all his own, and
while his playing is dense, his runs

where gas costs Boc per gallon,
families tend to own one car which
travels 25 miles per gallon. This
represents not only enormous sav—
ings in fuel resources but savings
in the energy expended to manur
facture automobiles as well.

Although as consumers, the imple
mentation of such economic reSr
traints as higher gasoline prices
are quite distasteful, one must ad-
mit that they are an effective means
oi reducing the current demands
for gasoline, In fact, after witnes-
sing the unecological habits oi the
Grinnell community it appears that
the individual is in need of such inr
centives in order to act in an ecolor
gtcally sound manner. So, the next

are always precisely articulated.
Though the main elements or his
style have remained constant--the
strident bass chord on the down-
beat, the use of modal scales and
chords built up in {ourths--a tree
mendous progression is evident
from his days with Coltrane, as a
comparislon between any oi his solos
on Sahara and, say, “Afi'OrBlue”
will show.

“Valley oi Life” ieatures McCoy’s
work on a Japanese stringed instru-
ment, the koto, and while it is a re:
freshing change from the normal
quartet instrumentation, is basic
ally a meditative excursion into
sound textures. “Rebirth,” which
concludes side one, is a vehicle for
intense, dramatic solos from For-
tune and Tyner, with Hill and Mou»
zon maintaining incredible rhythmic
drive throughout,

Side two is taken up entirely with
an extended composition, “Sahara,"
an example oi the music played by
the quartet in live periormances.
The piece alternates passages of
sounds from traditional African perm
cussion and wind instruments with
thematic statements and solo work,
Though much of “Sahara” is imr
provised, its structure is carefully
thought out and executed, lifting
the listener-from one lnood' tetan-
other. Both Tyner and Fortune de-
liver exciting, complex solos that
move the piece along with tremenr
dous intensity; in addition. Hillpre-
sents a dramatic hass solo against
a background oi ilutes and percus-
sion without sacrificing any of its
momentum.

Tyner's group, like that of San-
ders, Shepp, and others, carries
on the tradition established by John
Coltrane a decade ago. The empha-
sis is on the spiritual aspects ofthe
music, and, in contrast with the new
harmonic, rhythmic, and sound
structures of Herbie Hancock and
Weather Report, uses acoustic
instruments, unstructured rhythms,
and modal harmonies, Though the
electronic groups have the spotlight
now, the music of the “spiritual”
ensembles is lust as valid. As Hou-
cock himself Said during his visit
to Grinnell, you of the future holds
a place for both acoustic and elec-
tronic sounds, and the sounds of the
Coltrane tradition represented by
men like Tyner are simply too good
to be missed.
