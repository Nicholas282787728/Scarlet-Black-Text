Teri Geller, English, member of the Cultural .
Films Committee

Todd Armstrong. Russian, originally sugr
gested that “Rabbit a la Berlin" be shown. A
Polish movie ﬁlmed in Germany. “Rabbit a la

follows a colony of rabbits living in the "death
zone" of the Berlin Wallithc area ofland bc~
tween two walls, which is full orgtass to feed

" on. “Tlicse rabbits have this safe zone, Without
any prmators,"Armsrrongsaid,

The aim otters an interesting view of the
effect of the Berlin Wall coming down. "It
becomes a really compelling metaphor tor lite

Cally and you' re able to hit: your him in some
sort of happy warren but at the same time,
there are some ccrtam problems with that:
Armstrong said. You also couldnt read what
you wanted to read, you couldn't say what you
wantcd to say, but nonetheless there was a sort
of peaceful. happy cxrstenee. The wall sorncs

The second movie, “Lotnian’s World," is
about Russian cultural critic Yuri Lotnian.

is going to be pretty graphic,” Geller said of the *

festivals third ﬁlm “"Morphia is based on sev-
eral or Russian writer Mikhail Buigakovs short
stories of the 19205.

“[The movre is set during] the most turbu—
lent time of the 20th century in Russia, right
after the October Revolution when the Tsar
wrls dethroned," said Anatoly Vishcvsky. Rusr
sian, who is currently teaching a course on the
History of Russian Cinema. “[The plot] is

quite dark, and it follows the person's descent

into illness and insanity."

Although many of the films deal with the
social and historical implications of commur
nrsm in nations which are no longer commur
nist, their content and style are still distinctly
