of hitchhiking past the boundaries of Grinnell -- one of the top ten safest

towns in the US.

Early Amana History Explored

(Ed. noteuwith the annual Okto-
berl'est Celebration coming to the
Amana Colonies September 28 and
29, we thought this an appropriate
time to provide some background
on this popular area of Iowa.

This is part one at a three part

At the time of the Utopian comme
unities of the early 1860’s, the In-
spirationists, later called the nmana
Society were nearly 200 years old,
And lfDi' nearly that entire time,
they had been practicing a primary
Utopian, communal living.

However, the Inspirationists ViewV
ed their communal living only as
a social necessity to iurther the
advancement of their religious
community. Religion, it must be
understood, was the primary motie
vatlng force behind the sect. “So
long as faith remained untarnlshed,"
they said, “the community pros—
pered.”

This sect of religious persons, who
were said to have “prophesied like
the prophets of old”and werethere-
lore called lnspirationists, arose
during the last quarter of the 19th
Century.

In 1714, under the leadership of
two German religious relormers,
Eberhard Gruber and Johann Rock,
the lnspirationists became a dis-
tinct entity under the name “Comm-
unity or True Inspiration,” or the
Bib 'cal name, Amana. Originally
affiliated with the main church of
Germany at that time, the Lutheran,
they were soon persecuted by both
the government and the Church for
denying the dogmas and reiusing
to take. the prescribed oath of the
Lutheran church, and for refusing
military duty.

Eventually both Gruber and Rock
passed away and a young carpenter,
Brother Christian Metz took up the
position Metz was soon to inject
the Society with some of his more

‘ radical ideas which would eventually
iorce them to leave the country for»
ever.

Metz quickly realized that the sect
needed unity, and suggested that
they divorce themselves from the
outside world to form their own
religious community and be com—
pletely Self-sufficient, It soon be
came apparent the German govern.
ment would hardly allow such a
move, and Metz theretorc, suggeste
ed that the Society emmigrate to
America where there was no relis
glous persecution. The Society rea-
cted favorably and Metz, along with
three Elders, set Sail to America
to select and purchase land fortheir
community.

Alter a bitter winter Atlantic
crossing, the small grouppurchased

the Seneca Indian Reservation near
Buffalo, N.Y -nearly 5000 acres
with additional purchases made
later. Word was sent to those re-
maining in Germany and the Colony
of Ebenezer was laid out and DC-
cupied within tour months

The colony, with a population of
nearly poll was actually several
small villages, each with its own
store, school and church. In addi-
tion, the villages operated asawhcle
several small mills and factories.
A contemporary constitution was
written and the colony became the
“Ebenezer Society."

The Society Operated for 12 years
before it became apparent that a
move had to take place. More land
was needed tor the expanding pop
ulation, but more important, the
”modern" society of Buffalo was
beginning to corrupt their religious
ly communal life.

Once again, tour Elders, one of
them Metz, were selected to seek and
purchase new land. Definitely affect-
ed by the then expanding westward
movement, the four Elders moved
through Missouri, into Kansas, c-
ventually returning eastward to a
large tract of Government land on
the Iowa River in south—central
lowa where they purchased the near-
ly 18,000 acres. Word was again
sent back to those remaining in
Buffalo and the long westward move
ment, which would eventually take
ten years, began.

The earliest arrivals spent their
time cutting timber and quarrying
rock for the buildings of the future
community. They also planted ore
chards and purchased herds and
flocks of livestock and fowl.
Eventually, the old industries which
had existed in New York were re-
established and new ones started
The funds for linhncing these ven-
tures were steadily arriving from
the sale of the New York holdings
in Buttolo, which was completed
without the loss of a single dollar
A portion of this cash was invest»
ed in more land, bringing the to~
tal to 25,000 acres.

The first Amana village was estab~
lished in 1855~Amana~and was
followedeby; West and South Amanas
in 1856, High Amanzl in 1857, East
Amana in 1360. The necessity of
having a railroad outlet led to the
purchase oi the Mississippi and
Missouri Railway (later Rock Is
land) depot town of Homestead, In
1862 the village of Middle Amana
was created, making the total or
seven villages.

The villages, each a sell-sustain-
ing unit but united under the common
religious code, were incorporated
under Iowa law in 11359 as the
Amana Society and a new conslie
tution was adapted which established
a church brotherhood with “com—

Reporter AskS' 'Going My Way?’

(Ed. note .- Because the lack of
cars among students, coupled with
a desire to go elsewhere, hitchhik—
ing has emerged as a major irans~
portation means among students.
Rapidly though, statistics are show-
ing many of the unioreseen costs of
hitchhiking especially to women.
One researcher on the subject, nat-
han Adams writes » “In the case
of a girl who hitchhikes, the odds
against her reaching her destina-
tion unmolested today are literally
no better than if she played Russ-
ian roulette." 0n the road, Deborah
Redman an s h B reporter tells or
her personal experiences.)

by Deborah Redman
During an atternoon spent hitchhik-
ing locally, 1 was given a ride by
two women and five men, Neither of

the women, it happened, had ever
picked up a hitchhiker before. The

fact that l was a girl, and that it
was cold that day contributed to
their decision to pick me up.

One of the women attends Grinnell
College and assumed that I was a1—
so a student. The five men had difs
ferent reasons lor picking up hitche
hikers. “It’s kind ol cold out there
today," said one elderly man. Aman
with two children said “I used to
have to thumb when I didn't have
a car, so I know how it is.” Another

mon estate and property.”

By the late 1800's and early 1900’s,
however, the Society was beginning
td‘l find it difficult to hold its own
against the encroachments of mar
dern society. Progressive America
was beginning to claim their youth,
and with the advent of the auto-
mobile and the paved road, visite
ors and tourists were becoming
more and more frequent to the
small, religious, Germanespeaking
communities.

01d customs began to lose hold
and appeal, and some or the meme
hers were becoming less produc-
tive and weren’t accepting their
proper responsibilities and the bur-
den ol the tinancial support. Ale
though the Society tried to keep
the world out or Amana, production
and savings dwindled and eventually
it found itself half a million dollars
in debt and facing imminent bankv
ruptcy. A majority voted the inc
evitable, a split between the church
and the economy.

In 1931 each village elected rep»
resentatives and from them aCoun-
oil of 47 was elected which was to
decide the future course of the
colony.

The next year, 1532, marked the
end of the traditional Amana Socs
iety. The plan decided upon pro-
vided tor a yoint stock company to
control the business of the comm—
unity. Shares were allocated to the
members in proportion to years of
service, and finally, after over 200
years in joint ownership, shops
and homes became private proper-
ty.

It iS difficult for the laymen to
fathom the immensity of this
changeeover. It meant new work-
manship had to be established which
used newly acquired modern meth—
ods of production and was measur-
ed by the paid wage and the time
clock. Non-profit making enter-
prises had to be replaced and a
representative government oi stock
holders had to be established.

Initially, 200 hired hands who had
been replacing nonproductive meme
hers in the fields and factories were
tired, but an outside business mane
ager was hired, and was given a
virtual “free hand” in dealing with
the economic problems which had
beset the colony. .

Out of necessity, then, the “Comme
unity of True Inspiration” had had
to come to terms with the modern
society which surrounded it.

smiled and said, "I always pick up
girl hitchhikers.”

All seven people indicatedthat they
would be most willing to pick up
a hitchhiker in cold or rainy weat-
her. This was in contrast to the re-
port one hitchhiker made, stating
that rides were hardest to find when
it was raining. Several people said
they would hesitate to pick up twO
or more males. No one reported
any bad experiences involving hitch—
hikers.

A friend and I drove from Des

. Moines to the Amana colonies and
back to Grinnell by way of lowa

City, picking up as many hitchhikers
as we could. A leyear-old man
traveling to Mitchellville said he had
hitchhiked extensively throughout
the US last summer. During that
time he carried a kniie, although
not necessarily for protection, since
he was camping out. He had two
unpleasant experiences while hitch-
hikihg. in Minnesota, he was nearly
run over purposely, and in Butte,
Montana, he was hit in the face with
a chicken leg thrown from a win-
dow. “That,” he said, “ruined my
whole day.”

We picked up two hitchhikers, a
Zleyearmld woman and a 23—year
old man, on their way to lowa City.
The woman said she neverhitchhlkes
alone, except near her hometown.
The man said he had been hitchs
hiking when he was “picked up by
this guy on drugs. He almost drove
off a mountain road.H That was the
only problem in approximately
12,000 miles of hitchhiking. The wo-
man said she would never pick up a
hitchhiker if she was alone in the
car. The man said “They'd have to
look pretty sinister before I wouldn’t
pick them up. Neither of the two
carried weapons when they hitche
hiked.

Two ioeyear-old students, a man
and woman, were thumbing to Ames
when we gave them a ride The man
had done a lot of hitchhiking for
about three years, butthe woman had
not hitchhiked very often. The man
reported a near robbery, but he had
no money at the time. Once he was

taken in the wrong direction but
said, “It worked out for the best

after all.”

Unlike most or the people I talked
to, he said he would not pick up
lone girls, describing them as "rie
sky." The risk, he said, lay in the
possibility cl a girl claiming she
had been raped

Here on the campus, a random
sampling of 20 students revealed
that five students had never hitchr
hiked, one student had hitchhiked
only once. and the remaining 14 had

hitchhiked to various extents. or
those who hitchhiked, six said they
would not on it alone.

Most of the students put qualifica-
tions on people they would pick up.
Som‘e’ people said they would not
pick up strangers it alone inthe car,
or that they would have to form an
opinion about each person indivi-
dually. None or the 14 students
who had hitchhiked reported any bad
incidents.

Several commented cnhowlriendly
people were, and I also found that
to be true. While we were out inter—
viewing people, we ran out of gas
on interstate to, On our way back
with the gas can, a family gave us
an unsolicited ride back to our car.‘

lowa State Trooper Bob Kinselh,
who patrols interstate 80, stated that
hitchhiklng is legal throughout lowa,
including the interstate highway, as
long as the hitchhiker stays off
the travel portion of the road. Hits
chhikers should not appear to be
intoxicated No bikes are allowed
on the interstate system.

Although most people are indeed
friendly, those who hitchhike should
take certain precautions, Kinseth
had several suggestions tor hitche
hikers.

First, travel in pairs, and travel
light. Few people will pickup some»
body laden with luggage or pets.
It is common sense to wear bright
clothing, or perhaps a brightly col-
cred backpack. Try to limit your’
hitchhiking to the daylight hours.
Leave valuables at home, or have
them mailed ahead

in case you are robbed, Kinseth
suggests describing the driver men-
tally to yourself when lirst getting
into the car. A description of the
driver and the license number will
aid in returning to you what was
stolen. He suggested it is a good
idea to stay out of cars when you
see or smell drugs or alcohol and
if you incur any diiiiculties to call
the toll free number direct to the
police in Iowa -- BOD-36272200.

Many people do not realize this,
