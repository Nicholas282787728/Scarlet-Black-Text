GCGC panel

explores lifestyles

by Owen Charles .

The Grinnell College Gay Coma
munity <G,C.G.C.> sponsored a
panel discussion preceded by a
film on gay lilestyles Tuesday
night in South Lounge, The wells
attended presentation evoked
much audience participation and
provided welcomed insight into
homosexual issues and perspec-
tives.

The topics of discussion includa
ed the problem of “homophobia",
“coming out of the closet”, com-
mon misconceptions, and aspects
of gay—lifestyles. Panel speakers
included G.C.G.C. members Mike
Elder, Paula Langguth, Mary

'Jane Constant, Theresa
Seeburger and Matt Adams, with
Prolessor Dennis Haas acting as
moderator.

Starting off the discussion, Matt
Adams noted the misconception
that homosexuality involves
merely a/sexual bond, and stated,
“As with most heterosexuals, sex
is usually secondary to love in a
homosexual relationship.” Adams
also commented, “Many people
have the view that gay men just
want to be women, and gay
women justwant to bemen. this
is not the way it is."

Panel members Paula Lang-
guth and Theresa Seeburger also
dismissed the conceptions that all

homosexuals are overly pro-
miscuous and that the risk of child
molestation is greater among
gays.

The diversity oi the homosexual
comm ity was emphasized by
Mike lder, who stated, “The
homosexual community is just as
diverse as heterosexuals; we have
one thing in common, but we have
other faces to our lives indepen
dent oi our sexuality."

“Pass the butter please 7 by
the way, I'm gay,” is how Mary
Jane Constant jokingly described
the way she “came out oi the
closet" m her parents at the din
her table. She noted, however,
that mostly due to a generation
gap, “Parents don't cope with the
news as well as peers do _ they
are used to stereotypes.“

Constant remarked that unfors
tunately, “there are still a lot of
people “closeted” in this room, at
Grinnell, and in the world.”

Problems with homophobia on
campus were also discussed. Ask»
ed how bad homophobia at Grin-
nell is as compared to the rest of
society, Langgufh responded
“Just as bad, I hate to say.“ The
discussion ended on a more
positive note, though, with
panelists hoping for a more ra-
tional and accepting atmosphere.

Not a ‘burning’ issue....

by M. wiilignng Schumann

The regular fire inspection over
winter break at Grinnell has turn~
ed out so far to a false alarm, ac
cording to Dale Hawn, Director of
the Physical Plant.

A state iire inspector came to
Grinnell College, while students
were away on break, as part of
Iowa’s mandatory periodic in-
spection program. As of this Tues-
day, Hawn said, he was not
notified of any violations found in
that inspection — and in Hits case,
no news is good news.

Two years ago, when the college
was last visited by a state fire in-
spector, several violations were
reported. They have now ap
parently been corrected.

In most cases, Hawn explained,
he would have been notified of any
“flagrant violations" of me slate

ty here. The committee will also
be suggesting that the faculty im~
prove its scholarship, though in
general they find the quality oi
teaching to be satisfactory. To im-
prove the scholarship, Drake said,
the Committee is recommending
that the budget‘ be geared more
toward instructional areas.

In addition, the Committee will
suggest to the trustees that diere
are communication problems
among the faculty throughout the
college community. Drake said
that he did not expect any speciiic
actions to arise immediately irom
today‘s meeting. The trustees will
also vote on several honorary
degrees. .

After their iormal meeting to
day, the trustees will be talking
with any interested students at

will give students some more
direct input into the decisions of
the trustees and will in turn give
the Board members a more close-
up view of Grinnell students.

inspection.

Grinnell and all other post-

every two years under Iowa state
law; it had been rumored that

dentiﬁed the last time were Still
not fixed by the time of this most
recent inspection, but this is ap
parently not true.

Richard Lieber, Associate State
Fire Marshall in charge of post
secondary institutions, said last
Wednesday that he “can‘t tell
right now” about the results of the
inspection, because die report had
not at ﬂ’iat time been returned to
him, “I don‘t have the information
right here'in front of me in order
to comment'on the examination,"
he said.

For now, the fire-safety condi-
tions of the college appear to be no
burning issue.

Magurshak
speaks On
abortion

by Lois Harrison

Exactly when a ietus attains
“personhood”, and the moral
“tensions" surrounding the deci-
sion to abort were some of the
questions addressed by Praiasor
of Philosophy Dan’ Magurshak in a
lecture delivered Monday even-
mg.

Magui-sahk spoke to a group of
approximately 50 students in the
forum coffeehouse as part of a
series oi talks sponsored by the
Grinnell College Women’s Group,

Noting the overﬂowing number
oi people who crammed into the
Forum coffeehouse to hear his lec-
ture, Magurshak commented jok-
ingly, “I thought that this was
supposed to be an intimate
meeting".

Throughout his lecture, Pro-
iessor Magurshak repeatedly
referred to philospher Michael
Tooley. Tooley, according to
Magurshak, believed that the
abortion question centered on the
quality oi “personh " (i.e,, that
quality which distinguishes a per-
son with a certain rationality or
purpose irom a fetus). Jul when
a fetus attains the “potentiality”
ior personhood, Magurshak noted,

plays a crucial role in determin-
ing whether or not an abortion
should take place.

Magurshak downplayed his per
sonal opinion on the question,
stating mat abortion was a sub-
ject that demanded “moral and
thoughtful consideration” tonal]
parties involved. “Moral
tension”, according to Magur»
shak, would be inevitable when
dealing with such a sensitive
issue. Magurshak's words were
well proven, as several members
of the audience lrequently punc-
tuated Magurshak's remarks with
their own views upon the issue.

MaguKShak concluded that “it is
not wise to think of abortion as a

Dentel letter passed at

by Melissa Kagle and Will Gar-
rison

The Joint Board meeting
Wednesday night was dominated
by the administration’s proposed
plan to cut Activities Coordinator
Georgia Dentel’s position by halt.

The Joint Board approved a let-
ter proposed by SGA vice Presi-
dent Pete Hautzinger to President
Drake urging him “to reconsider
the position currently held by the
Administration and devise a solu-
tion_ to the problem that is
amenable to both sides.”

Hautzinger’s letter claimed that
Dentel’s.”commitment to her job
has been instrumental in creating
an excellent social program
here," Fred Klatz, concerts chair,
who often works with Dentel, ar-
ranging concerts, supported Haut»
zinger's statement, “You see the
fruits of Georgia‘s labor in the
programming you see around you.
Without all this life would be pret-
ty dull,”

Klatz cited a survey, done seven
years ago, placing Grinnell’s acr
tiviu‘es program among the top
three in the nation. He claimed
that this achievement was due to
Georgia’s work and “her contacts
and the trust she has built in the

entertainment world. ”

However, Klatz also felt that the
letter would not accomplish
anything because the negotiations
are already in the ﬁnal stages.
Klatz suggested that stronger
measures would be more effective
at this point, such as boycotting
the telethon or talking to the
trustees.

Another objection to the letter
voiced by Mike Marcus, Younkei's
Hall President, was that almost
all the Joint Board members, and
the students they represent, have
not had enough contact with‘
Dentel to be able to make such a
judgement.

‘ Marcus also questioned the let-
ter's statement that there is a
“trend in current Administration
policy, speciiically reducing the
financial obligations of the college
by altering or reducing ceatain
staff positions that have a Vital
impact on the quality or student
life here at Grinnell,”‘and Joint
Board’s apparent concensus that

there was no justification for cut- '

ting Georgia Dentel’s pusition. He
believed, given Dentel's obvious
good job performance, that the
administration must have had
some pragmatic reason for cut-

Black History quiz to be held

by Karen Tyler

Using dates, names and places
as weapons, South Lounge will
become a battlefield this Satur-
day, reb. 11 at 2 pm. when Grin-
nell College hosts the second an-
nual Black History Awareness
Quiz. Coe College students and
Grinnell students will ﬁght it out
to see who is more aware of Black
History.

Last year, Grinnell ran away
with the trophies, Maybe it was
the home court advantage. Maybe
it was Randy Roth, who coached
last year's winners and is
coaching this year's team, too.
“We’re going to beat their pants
off," said LaVeta Small, Minority
Affairs Director. ,

The team members this yea
are Cindi Chessick,,Abel Smith,
Kim King, Bernard Jackson,
Steven Atkinson, and Karen

Tyler. Two of the team members,
Cindi Chessick and Bernard
Jackson, are veterans from last
year’s team.

The quiz will be run in a college
bowl iormat. The teams will be
asked a question and the iirst to
respond correctly will receive
points. At the end oi the game the
points are totaled. The team with
the highest score wins.

The questions are in several ior-
mats: true or ialse, matching,
identiiying, and fill-in-therblank.
All questions concern important
iacts in Black History.
