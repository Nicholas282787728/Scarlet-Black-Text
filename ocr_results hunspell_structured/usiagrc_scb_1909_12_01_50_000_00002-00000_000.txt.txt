CLASS BASKET BALL.

The small attendance at the first
two games or the interclass series was
somewhat of a disauuoiutmcut In
years past in spite oi an occasional
unpleasantness these games have prov.
on to he very popular with the centire
student body. They have done a great
service for the college in affording an
opportunity for an expression of
wholesome enthusiasm and developing
material for the college teams later
on. One at the tine teatures ot the
previous games which seems to have
been overlooked in this series is the
class colors which havc been placed
about the various places where the
different classes gathered. This feats
ure seems to have been overlooked by
all except the Freshman yesterday.
To all the classes, get our your colors
and your members and come ta the
Men‘s Gymnasium at the time or the
next games and enjoy yourselvcs It's
too fine an onnortuni 1 to he 111i.

IS FOOTBALL d N ENS/TY?

Editor Scarlet and Black: I have
read with 1ntorest 10111 cmummlLs iron1
time to time on the present roothnll
situation at Grinuell it might be cane
sidered truly a , 11 or degeneration in
some quarters, when poor old Cornell
should he ahlc to trail the scarlet and
black in the dust, and I have hocn ex.
pecting to hear a nail from some of
those who were ”giants in those days"
that we read about. Concerning the tie-
plorahio state of otiaiis.

However, I was not a giant, so that
the situation is entirely sat factory
to me, and as a consistent advocate of
the abolition or football as a college
game, i indeed have reasons to rejoice.
it convinces me that Grinucll students
are not carried away with an insane
desire for the game as they once were.
The mere fact that the semester fee
for athletics was found necessary is
proof that football as a. financial in.

That football is El. brtilol pastime and
dangerous to life and liillll, one needs
only to read this year‘s mortality list
to be convinced, hot so bad as Cour
pared with other sports, but still en.
til‘ely too many young men sacrificed

gladiators, for the pleasure of the pop.
ulace, I firmly believe and am simply
reiterating the statement 1 made in
1906, that football is doomed in college
circles. It will always remaln a youth

Dugilism. but the time is not far diSr
taut when it Will be whooed by col-
lege faculties and prohibited by legis.
latures, the same as prize fighting.

Perhaps the time is not at hand for
its abolition at: Grinllell, but with any
other season or two like the one just
past, the continuous defeats by second
rate schools W111 111‘.ve had its effect,
and when you take nu'tly the glory of
winning, football becomes a lame of~
fair ln the eyes of most undel‘gl‘adih
ates. It. is the desire to will. and not
the game per :8 that makes football
popular with college students. As
proof of my statements I need (it'll:r to
