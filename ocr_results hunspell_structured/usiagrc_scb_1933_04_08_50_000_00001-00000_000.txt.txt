Own Plrograms Friday
at Goodnow Hall

By Eugene Wood

Believe it or not, but it is impasse
ible to blow a pingrpong ball out of
a funnel. Another strange fact is

same time.

Perhaps many persons are inclined
to doubt the truth of these state-

present at the physics ”open house”
on the evening of Friday, April 14,
these and many other queer and in-
teresting experiments will be actual-
ly demonstrated,

Exhibits on Three Floors

The physics department, headed by
Grant 0. Gale. is staging this “open
house” on its fortieth anniversary.
Unlike most “open houses" there
will be no dancing or pause for re-
freshments, but there will be enough
exhibits on all three floors of Good-
now ball to interest everyone.

The students of the physics class-
es will actually demonstrate many of
the more interesting and spectacular
phases of mechanics, sound, heat,

Minneapolis, discussed “The
Church and World Peace". this
afternoon, in speaking to delegates
who are attcndirrg the Conference
on International Relations here.

Council Decrees
Paddles Extreme
for ‘Prep Days’

The stunts of the old, traditional
“hell week”. so earnestly sighed for
by upperclassmen this year, will
again be in evidence April 21 and 22.
as “prep days” will be held, in accord
ance with the plan for prepping out.
lined by the council of house presi-
dents last fall.

In regard to paddling during prep
days, the council has decreed that
upperclassmcn may have recourse to
the paddle if it is necessary for prop—
er functioning of their disciplinary
machine during the two-day period.
However, in the fire drill. one of the
old-time stunts being revived, pillows
will be used instead of paddles as a
means of inciting the freshmen to
greater efforts.

Individualistic costumes will again
be in evidence, Bathing suits are
suggested by the council, but it is
probable that some of the halls will
vary this with costumes of their own
design.

Medial duties to be assigned to the
preps will include waxing clubroom
floors, washing clubroom windows,
and beating rugs Various other de~
vices to increase the discomfiture of
freshmen and the gratification of
upperclassmen will include clubroom
stunts, a treasure hunt, and a. kan-
garoo court.

Freshmen will not be allowed to
leave town during the probation per-
iod.

Men, Women to Compete for Prizes
in Annual Spaulding Speech Contests

Preliminary Trials Planned
by Ryan for Near Future;
$150 Offered

The first preliminary try-outs for
the annual Spaulding contests for
Grinnell men and women will be held
within two weeks. according to John
P. Ryan. professor of speech.

The Spaulding contests are held
each spring on the Grinnell college
campus, and cash prizes are awarded
the winners of the first three places
in both the men’s and the women's
divisions,

H. w, Spauldirrg Cave Money

The men's Spaulding contest orig-
inated through the generosity of
Henry W. Spaulding, who set aside
money so that each year awards of
$50, 330, and 520 could be given for
the purpose of training men to speak
well in public.

All Grinnell college men, except

 

 

tn so who have previously won first
prize in the contest, are eligible to
compete. The emphasis of the contest
is on delivery, and a declamation or
original oration may be used, as the
contestant desires. Selections should
be from five to eight minutes in
length.
Audience Decides

The basis of judging the contest is
on physical, vocal and mental deliv-
ery, and usually an audience opinion
is used in determining the winners.

According to Mr. Ryan, men of the
college are urged by the department
of speech to try for the Sparrlding
prizes becausc "they will improve
their delivery; they will learn to
speak better in public; they will find
a chance to give their speaking abil-
ity a real test; they will see how
their speaking compares with that of
their fellow students; and they may
win a prizc of $50, $30, or $20."

Rabbi Gordon Discusses
Church, World Peace

This afternoon at 1:15 o‘clock.
Rabbi Albert 1. Gordon, in discuss<
ing “The Church and World Peace,"
outlined a peace program for church-
es of all crecds.

“Church emphasis," he said, “has
been on the ideal of peace and that
is all. Yet that it not enough.”

In the wars of history, he said, no-
tions have played one god against
another. “In Germany at present, a
statc religion is being adopted in
which even Jesus is eliminated be-
cause he was a Jew.

“The Reformation did not actually
separate the state and religion. The
moment that the church has done
anything contrary to state beliefs, it
has been looked upon as rmpatrioti
It is looked upon as a weak m‘ganr
zation because in the past it has been
cautious rather than courageous.”

in hrs church peace program, be
enumerated four points.

1. Church loaders must be the first
to lose their inferiority complex and
break the unholy alliance with the
state.

2. A federation of church councils
