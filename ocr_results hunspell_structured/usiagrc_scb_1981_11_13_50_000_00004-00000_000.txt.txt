all about
it case in point

Newspapers writing about themselves — that’s something we try to
avoid because we think it generally self—serving. But now we feel we
must make an exception. .

Let's discuss the role of the SM} on the Grinnell College campus. We
are simply here to provide information. That’s really what our job is all
about. Admittedly, we also try to pro ide a forum for the open expres-
sion of ideas, but our main responsibility is to be a source of news. Unr
fortunately, it seems that not everyone understands the motivations
behind our actions. A case in point:

Some residents of Dibble Hall were recently involved in breaking in-
to some rooms of their fellow students. The hall council decided it
wanted to take the ease to Judicial Council for further action and a
hearing was held on Thursday evening, Nov. 5. After hearing about the
story the 5&3 assigned a reporter to find out all the facts about the inci-
dent so that they could be reported in this edition of the 88:13.

The amount of interference that the reporter and other S&B staff
members encountered was incredible. We were told that there was no
need for the 5&8 to “drag it out into the open.“ But that’s not the point.
It is our responsibility to report the news; all we were trying to do was
our job.

One major complaint from the sources in the Dibble story was that
by printing the names of the students charged with breaking into the
rooms we would be opening them up to possible questioning and abuse.
We were quite aware of that fact and had no intention of printing the
students' names.

The campus community is just that, a community, and the staffers of
the 5&8 live in that community. We recognize that, at times, it may be
inappropriate to “name names.” Because of this the 5&8 has a stanr
ding policy that it will not identify the names of students if that idenr
tification could, in any way, hurt those students’ reputations for the re-
mainder of their time at Grinnell.

The tragic incident of rape is another example of the kind of story
that prompts us to invoke this policy. Under no circumstnaces would
we ever identify the victim of a rape. We feel we can do our job, in no
way compromise our journalistic ethics and still recognize that we are
part of a community.

Some people seem to feel that we are out to get the story at all costs
and that we seek only to play the role of muckraker. We think that’s a
very disturbing opinion for members of the campus community to
have. We also get upset when people forget that 5&8 staffers are
students too. During the time that we were investigating the Dibble
story a staff member made a personal call to a friend who lives in Dib»
ble. After leaving 'the message on the door, some Dibble residents call»
ed the staffer back to ask why she was calling this person. Considering
the fact that the call was strictly personal, it was a pretty sad commen-
tary on the state of the relationship and the campus at large.

We hate to have this turn out to be a lesson in journalistic ethics but
maybe that’s what’s needed. The 8&8 can function as a part of the
campus community and fulfill its function as an objective news source
on campus. Try to remember that next time you say “no comment.”

i am distressed about the possible cur-

credits in different departments im-
plemented here What is the reasoning for

lure in the curriculum" that Dean of
Faculty Catherine Frazer mentions? .

Ms rrazcr also said that she doesn't
think the open curriculum at Grinnell is a
"central point" ior students deciding to
come here. i would like to
make it clear that the open curriculum
was the mayor reason i chose Grinnell I
deiinilely would not be here ii there was a
more structured curriculum than there is
now, i think by structuring the curriculum
that Grinnell will lose much or its Unlr

Like the annual return of the swallows to
Capistrano. the Grinnell College communi-
ty has once more embroiled Itself in an
issue of high moral and ethical ln~
Significance. Every year there appears an
issue on campus 7 pitting roommate,
against roommate, freshman against
senior, student against administration or
some other cleavage which brings out. of
hiding every knee~jerk liberal and every
fanatical reaclio ry Once upon a lime,
the greal social issues were cheerleaders
at football games, the McConnel Towers
and that cver-popular-lavoriie, the mud
pit. And now, it's the James Gang Bang,
(Oh Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?)

The advocates for changing the name of
the Gang Bang to something less oliensive
are greatly concerned with the increase of
rapes and assaults on college and town
women in Grinnell over the last few mon-
tlls The violation or a person‘s body is
morally reprehensible, no matter what the

context. Not only should we act to slop
these crimes, we must. An atmosphere of
fear is permeating the campus. Some
women are airaid to go off campus at night
to attend parties or to enjoy a stroll. This
type of climate must be eradicated.

But answer the iollowing truthiully —
Will assaults decrease because lhe name
of the James Gang Bang is changed? will
the creation at an alternative party mean
one less rape? iseriously doubt it. The cen-
tral issues — rape, assault and fear 7 are
not even addressed by a name change ii
the name of the Gang Bang is dropped for
something less objectionable. some
women will still nol attend because they
are arraid of being assaulted as they walk
home alone afterwards, The real substanr
live issue has been shunted to the side as
people are caught up in the vehemency of
[hair demands.

Thc preceding is not to suggest that i

Gang Bang Far irom'il‘. in my View, those
