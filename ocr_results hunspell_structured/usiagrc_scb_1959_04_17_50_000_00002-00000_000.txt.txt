Speak Out And Be Heard

Just two months ago (February 153,) a paragraph ill tllis
Column said:

"This week the S&B begins a series of articles on the

 

Social situation at Grinnell, We believe that ill doing this we:

are not ‘creating an issue but_pr0\'iding' an outlet for the
\l'ideepread dissatisfaction that we have seen on both north

and south campus." In that nine issue Mr. McClung‘ wrote,

“The Social Skirmish - Par T.”

This is not an attempt to pat ourselves on the back but
to point out tllat some things can be accomplished on this
campus and rather efficiently too.

The measures approved this week will do much to allew
iate the widespread dissatisfaction that we believe e. start

The approval of these measures also shows that the

Deans, tlle faculty and the administration are ready to conr‘
Slder anything that they believe the students honestly wantt

or need.

V‘Ve believe that the extension or the “open lounge” and
”openvopen house” privileges will satisfy the need for privacy
between students and will also allay any fears that friends
of the college might have entertained during the last two
n'll’ﬁl'tylls ill regard to just what is happening at ”Old Grill—
lie .

“Old Grinnell” is changing — not “going (lfi' the deep
end” - but changing nonetheless.

One would lhink that in this

it would not be too dillicull to

sure all would ﬁnd it n good

To the Editor:

May I suggest that die dis.
courtesy extended to wives of
Grinnell collcgc faculty mom»
Ioczs in your editorial last week
was uncnllcd for and ‘bencath
rho usunl dignity or your pilbli»
canon. An anonymous lcdcr is
a dangerous weapon, and rc.,
gnrdless of the identity ol the
sender ol the particular lcucr‘
undrr nrr, I submil that the
nvoapon should not be pcrmillcd,
m backﬁre inlo n group at ran-
dom,

Suggesting that lhe lndics
are a potential D.A.R. or
ll',c.T,u. is at best ridiculous,
nnd might be interpreted by
faculty wives ns an indication ,
that their hospitality nnd perr
sonnl kindliesses to students
(have less oi an impression
than nn unroriuunlc mistake
(to sny the lenst) which may
possibly be attributed ta one
of lhem.

l lcel nuilr rcrldin that you
