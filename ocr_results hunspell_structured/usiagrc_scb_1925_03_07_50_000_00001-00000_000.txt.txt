(By James A. Work)

The Grinneli School of Music has
long been held ~onc ol' the best‘
in the Middle West. A vital reason
for this was demonstrated last night
when the Grumeli String Quartet pre-
sented its annrral lining. concert of
chamber music. Few if any institu-
tions of Grinuell's calibre are produc-
ing faculty organizations comparable
with the Quartet. Professors Peck

Smith fol-in an organization whose im-
portance to Grinnell artistically and
from an advertising standpoint,
hardly be overrated.
Last night’s program seemed a tritle
monotonous. the players did not often
, exercise the full tonal power or vol-
ume of their instruments; but their
splendid ensemble made up for any
spectacularness that might have been,
lacking. Each of the members is an
individual artist, and their unison
and sympathy of feeling throughout
numbers of considerable technical
difficulty bore testimony to the hours
at arduous practice which they have
spent in perfecting their group work.

The Debussy Quartet was met with
high favor by the audience. The del—
icacy and subtle rhythm or the first
movement demonstrated the precision
and fine technique of the players,
while the flowing harmony and the
dulcet tonal quality of the second
thrilled the audience. The first violin,
which carried the melody through
most of the second movement seemed
occasionaly obtrusive, but the tonal
harmony was rarely broken.

The tour en force of the recisl, the
Schumann Quartet, although long and_
heavy was well received. The final,
movement was a rare exhibition of.

“European Political Boundaries"
which first appeared in the Political

was reprinted in the Historical Out-

in pamphlet form by the New York

'ticle called “The Coldward Course of

Progress," prrblished in the Political

Inter-est in Iowa basketball centers '
invGrinnell next Monday night, when
the Drake eager-s meet the Pioneers
on their borne court. It is the last
game of the season for both teams.

The Bulldogs hold a 19 to is victory
over the Scarlet and Black at Drake.
Wand in the comparison of scores, seem
to have a fairly good chance of re-
peating the victory her-e, Grinneu is
in the throes of a slump which has
pulled them down in the Valley aver
age and unless they show different
lorrn from the previous few games,
they will have a hard time turning the
last game into a win. ,

Drake and Grinnell are traditional
enemies and usually display a better
brand of athletics against each other
than against anyone else. Grinnell
has a higher standing in the Valley
than does Drake brrt the last few
games show that Drake has been im-
proving while the lPoneers have not.
Should Grinnell win, it would place
them third from the bottom in the
Valley standings not to mention break-
ing a long string of victories held by
the Bulldogs.

Line-up Doubtful

Three men on the learn will be
playing their last game and it will be
their last chance to defeat the team
that has so many times dealt them
the low end of the score, These men
are Captain Galvin, Winters and Dogs,
although the latter is now sutferihg
with a wrenched back ‘and may not be ,
in shape to play. Wilson is the only
other senior on the Squad and while
he has not played in many games, he
is a reliable man and his loss ‘will be
keenly felt.

it is difficult to predict the starting
line-up but it will probably be Gelvin
and Winter, guards; Bogs, center;
Moran and either Chase or Lamb, for—
wards. ln case huge .is unable to
start, Moran may be shifted to center,
or Seeland will play the pivot position.
