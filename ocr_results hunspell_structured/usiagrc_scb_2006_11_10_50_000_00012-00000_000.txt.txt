The Snetlue

Crazies follow wherever Lindsay travels

There just seems to be something about me that
attracts the craziesVththcr it is some part ofmy de-
rneanor or simply blind lttck,l r dlycoulcln’t v.All
I know is that they ﬂock toward me, regardless ofnry
location, From the stoner in Portland who couldn't get
over the grecnness of my contact lenses to the homes
less man in Boston who called me Santa Claus and
tried to set me up with
his 70- ar-old friend,
I have been bombarded
from coast to coast with
a cornucopia of craziness,
But my rcccnt Altellim
tive Break trrp showed
me that the city oi’Den—
vcr rs whacked out, even
by my standards.

Nothing solidifies a sense ofgroup cohesion like
the common goal of avoiding a total whackjoh As
such, my group managed to bond before we even
got out of Iowa. At the Ottumwa train station, we
had the pleasure of meeting a delightful character
whose name I don’t recall, but who embodied all of
the sketchy qualitics I generally attribute to people
named Billy. Billy started out innocently enough as
that friendlyrlowan sort of fellow who strikes up a
conversation for the sake of being nice and trying to
assuage the collective boredom of waiting, But it soon
became clear that Billy was not ordinary, that he was,
at best, an oversharei and, at worst, an exceedingly
clingy pathological hat.

When asked what he did for a living, Billy told us
mattertofrfactly that he was a “killer." After the nets
voiis silence that followed this statement. he elabot
rated, telling its that he worked in a slaughterhouse,

and detailed the exact process by winch he and his
coworkers dispatched 1,000 pigs an hour, Billy's math
at thrs pornt seemed rather suspect, as he clarmctl that
he could lift a 500—pound hog over his hcad and easily
kill 12,000 of them over the course of 1 single shift.

Having thus impressed us with hrs slaughtering
skills, Billy stepped up his creel s suhstantially by

at g a phase of uric
ne sary personal closer
ncss. He sat down in the
middle of the group and
began showing oft‘ pics
tures of family members
on lns cell phone, as well
as prctures of a friend
who was apparently on
the incoming train, with
whom he was trading (CM messages, Ofcotirse, this
rctprired hrm to lean cntrrely too
close to various female members
of the group.

In a valiant effort to rescue us
from the immense crecpincss of
Billy,onc ofour leaders suggested
that we move outside to the pliitr
form, in the hopes that the chilly
autumn air would be enough ofa
deterrent to keep him inside. Alas,
this move was in vain, and Billy
remained ivrth us until (in: moment we hoardcd the
train. at which point he gave us the charming scrrdoff
oftouehing every girl in the group as we walked past.

The crazrness only continued once we arrived
in Denver. Our trip to the grocery store on the first
day resulted in a charmingly disturbing encounter

As the week were on, we experienced hobo insane
iry moments too numerous to mention in detail. We
attracted random comments about how ive were per-
sonaily contributing to the beauty of Denver, and at
one point we even managed to inadvertently incite a
homeless right outside ofa liquor stor still, my most
cherished moment of madness was a massive staged
spectacle that occurred on our last night in town,

We were taking the shuttle down the 16th Street
Mall just after dusk when the bus crime to an abrupt
halt and the driver began to honk his horn,V\/e looked
out the windows to search for the
source of the disturbance and
found, much to our horror, that
the street was swarming wnh
zombies Fortunately for us, the
horde of the evil undead grew
weary alter only a few moments
of poundrng on the srde of our
shuttle, and moved onward to
seek more accessible brains in
other parts of downtown.

We never did discover why this spectacle occurred,
butt considered it a very apt sendorf from the city of
Denver, which seemed to have more than its fair share
of only mildly threatenrng werrdoes. All 1 can hope
for now is that my future trips will be equally eventful.
Given my track recordl think it’s a safe bet.

Back from New Orleans, a call for action

When Hurricane Katrina crossed
paths with the city of New Orleans
over a year ago, it opened up a deep,
unforgiving wound on a city already
struggling with major social and eco-
nomic problems, Over 30 percent of
the New Orleans population lives be
low the poverty line, and Katrina den
stroyed what few possessions and pride
these individuals had left.

While many Americans believe
that New Orleans is rebounding from
tragedy With significant aid from the
government on local, state and federal
levels, they are sadly mistaken. In a re—
cent trip to thc city,l drove down the
deserted streets of the Lower Ninth
Ward, which, until three weeks ago,
had had no potable water since the
storm struck land. I walked past rows
and rows ofuntouched, deserted hous—
es that were once called “home.” Over
750,000 residents cannot yet return to
their homes, and many never will.

When the federal government is
spending 5177 millrort each day on

Iraq, it is reasonable to ask, “Why hasn’t
the government made rebuilding New
Orleans a priority?" A year after the
storm. there are no plans for large-scale
infrastructure and redevelopment, and
none will emerge in the near future.
Though i have a deep destre to con-
vey my feelings of frustration, helpless-
ness and utter shock that I experienced
during my
vrsrt to
New Orv
leans, it is
more up-
pro priate
to focus on
what must
be done. Because there is no federal
plan {or the city, volunteers are direly
needed just as much now as they wore
weeks after the storm. I traveled down
over {all break with 30 other Grinncll
students who also sacriﬁced their vat
cations to help clean out abandoned
houses. Many people asked me upon
my return, “What is the sense of gut

Tire answer is two-fold. My crew of
10 volunteers worked on five houses for
two full, grueling days, All in an, a gut—

life, but most importantly. how indie
vidual people can change the world. As
part ofa team of 30 other college Stur
dents, we helped change lives one house
at a time. Tire message is clear: Your
family, church, youth group, friends and
coworkers can all help. Send a group
down to help gut and rebuild houses, If
you cannot go, donate money to groups
in New Orleans who are helping house
and feed volunteers who travel to the
city

Most importantly. spread the word.
Most Americans do not realize the dire
situation that remains in New Orleans,
as w as in other areas afﬂicted by
Hurricane Katrina. Finally, consider the
elected ofﬁcials at the local, state and
federal levels who allowed th attis
of New Orleans to remain due for the
past year,

We must send them ti message that
this situation cannot be tolerated, and
it all begins with one vote, a hammer, a
crowbar, a wheelbarrow and some hard
work
