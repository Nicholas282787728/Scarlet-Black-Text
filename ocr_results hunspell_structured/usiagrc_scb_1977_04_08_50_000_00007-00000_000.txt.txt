Tennis
anyone?

by Jim Strickier

In honor of the recent visit of
Rosenfield Lecturer Morton
l-ialperin. the Grinnell College
tennis team has scheduled two of
its toughest tennis meets oi the
year for this weekend to show how
to negotiate with “superpowers.”
Well, Ripon and the University of
Northern Iowa may not be
superpowers, but they do field
pretty tough tennis teams.
Tomorrow, the team travels to
Cedar Falls to play UNI and the
University of Wisconsin at
LaCrosse, but it is today’s home
match against Ripon for which the
team has been preparing. Ac-
cording to Dan Edwards and
Carter Newton, it should be “the
best home meet of the year.”

Ripon has all six players back
from the team that finished a Close
third in the Midwest Conference
Tournament last ymr. They are
considered one of the favorites for
this year's title. The Pioneers‘
performance against them should
saya lotaboout how much of a shot
Grinnell has for this year’s
championship.

Poor weather early in‘ the week
forced the team to continue
practicing indoors, despite a great
desire to begin adjusting to the
outdoor courts. As one team
member said, “Indoors, the ball
slides on the smooth Tartan sur-
face and seems to jump at you.
Outdoors, the rougher suriace of
the courts grabs the ball, slowing it
down, but increasing the effect of
spin,"

Playing singles for Grinnell this
Weekend will ‘be Dan Edwards,
Carter Newton, Joe Topper, Eric
Christiansen, Jim Strickler and
either Bennett Bartlett 0r Kent
Christian. Doubles teams will be
Edwards-Newton. Topper-
Christiansen. and either Stn'cklerr
Bartlett nr StricklerrChristian.

by Bob Meyer

April 5 was the scheduled date
for the Grinnell “Best Ball"
tournament. Unfortunately snow
plagued Powesheik County and the
date ior play was moved iorward
to 1 pm. today,

This change of date forces
Carleton and Coe to miss the
tourney. The remaining six teams
Joining Grinnell at the Oakland
Acres golf course are Cornell,
Knox. Monmouth, UNI, William
Penn, and Central.

Eight of Grinnell’s nine team
members will play this aiternoon.
Mike Hopkins, the team‘s captain
and best player, will not be
playing. Representing Grinnell
Will be Dave Vanderoool. Phil
Gutman, Rich Fendler, Kevin
Rackstraw, Larry Callison. Steve
Moyer, Dave Kohm, and Dave

Harmon

In “Best 3311' tournaments the
usual scoring etiquette is not ob
served. The golf team is divided
into duos which compete as
separate units. Although both
partners shoot at each hole, only

one score is given.

The higher of the two individual
scores is dropped, and the lower
number of shots is recorded. This
difference In scoring adds a new
dimension in the coaches‘ strategy
when pairing players. In many
instances talented golfers are
matched with players at a lower
level of Skill. Coach Edd Bowers
has been forced to hold practices in
bone chilling temperatures in
order to evaluate his athletes and
iorm his pairings before the
tournament.

The ultimate dark beer is in town and on tap.
