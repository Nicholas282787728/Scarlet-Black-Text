Science Club Will Meet
Monday Night for Dinner

The Science club will meet Monday
evening for dinner in Blair hall. Fol—
lowing the dinner, there will be talks
on biological summer schools by stu-
dents aud faculty members who have
attended them. The schools described
will be those at Cold Harbor, L. 1.,
Douglas Lake, Mich, Woods Hole,
Mass. and Iowa Lakeside.

 

 

ice we do our talented colleagues in
taking them so entirely for granted,
not realizing how superbly their daily
grind as teachers is the background
of distinguished musicianship.

Peck Busy

Here is Professor Peck, for more
than 25 years the wheelhorse of the
orchestra, the glee club, the college
choir, and the string quartet, and for
awhile he beat the bass drum in the
band, Looito say nothing of extra-
curricular acti ties of a varied and
important character, with a round of
rehearsals that gives him no rest
either on Saturday or Sunday, a life
that would exhaust an average "ar-
tistic temperament" in no time at
all; but he bobs up fresh as a daisy.
plays a violin better and better all
the time, and goes at it with the em
thusiasm and earnestness that make
for real virtuosity. The rest of us
may well hang our heads when we
complain that we have so much to do
that we have no time for original
work.

Great Ercniug

Miss MacDonald deserves all this,
too, and her piano playing, like Mr.
Peck’s violin playing, gains in free
dom, authority. and hrilhancy each
time she appears. In their recital
Wednesday they traversed a wide
range of musical thought. fiom the
simple fragrance of Beethoven's
earlier sonata, through the chaste
idealism of Faure to the exuberant
impetuousness of the contemporary
Italian with the queer name. and in
every field of expression they were
thoroughly at home. and thoroughly
effective.

It would have been a great evening
had artists from London or Vienna
given it. but it was a still greater
evening because the artists are our
fellow citizens. People who Weren't
there missed someLhing.

Dickerson, B ass -Baritone,
Highly Praised

Hugh Dickerson, Chicago. bass-
bar-itone, will appear in the fifth

sic critics. The Chicago Daily News
says, “Hugh Dickerson sings with
finesse in style, with poeay and with
a tone which is vibrant and well pres
duced. He is a singer of musical tal-
mots."

“Especially lovely in his reading
and phrasing," was the comment of
Hermann DeVrles. an American or -
lo, on Mr. Dickerson's singing. "Ex-
cellent timbre; unaffected but effec-
tive style."

Nothing Taken
But Cash

Pioneer Five

Loses Local
Opener, 25-23

Early Lead Helps Visitors;
Bassham. Rowe Stars
of Fast Tilt

A seven point lead to which Bass-
ham, freshman forward, led the Uni—
versity of Tulsa basketball team dur-
ing the first five minutes of play,
proved too much of a handicap to
Grinnell college cagers here last
night as the Pioneers succumbed in
an overtime match, 25 to 23.

After McCreary started the Grins
hell ball rolling with a gift toss, Dune
can hit twice from the floor and
Rowc once while Dorrough was mak—
ing a free toss and at the middle of
the period the Hurricane lead had
been clipped to s to 7. Alexander,
Bassham. and Dorrougb pulled the
count up again. however, and at half
Grinnell trailed, 13 to 10.

Pioneers Tie Score

Ullrich found the hoop with a pair
of charity attempts early in the sec-
ond half and Whiteside followed with
a similar shot. Frye’s field goal tied
the count at 14-all but again Bass-
ham rushed into the breach for the
visitors, this time with a pair of
field goals.\

A field goal by Frye and another
by Rowe make the count stack at 19
to is as Whiteside kept his outfit
in the lead with another free throw.
Willis garnered another goal for the
visitors‘but Duncan’s toss from the
line and Rowe‘s goal tied it up at
21-all as the playing time ended.

Waite Hits

Pringle opened the overtime scor-
ing with a field goal and Willis fol-
lowed it with another. Waite went
into the game and hit the hoop once
but Grinnell failed to match the Tul-
sa men as eight consecutive shots at
the hoop missed before the gun
sounded.

It was the first home game for
Grinnell and despite the loss, the
Pioneers kept the fans shouting the
major part of the time with a brand
of scintillating floor play that would
be hard to match.

Basket-Eyes Fall

Their weakness at hitting the has
ket, both from the floor and the free
throw line cost them the game last
night. The Pioneers missed 10 free
shots while the visitors failed at only
six charity throws.

Rowe, a senior, and the only mem-
ber of the starting five who is not
a veteran. led the Grinnell attack as
he has in three of the four games ,
played. He scored eight points.

Bassham, the little. blond forward
for the Hurricanes. nabbed scoring
honors for the evening with 10 points.
He was largely responsible for the
Grinnell defeat, slipping behind the
defense for some easy shots. He pull-
ed the same trick at. Tulsa Tuesday
night to count a victory for his team
there.
