Dcscend into the ancicnlcave and
enter the Grinnell College Archives!
Bring yourlamp and ﬁnger the dusty
tomes lining the infinite stacks. Be-
ware! There’s no card catalogue
here: the Keeper of Knowledge
knows what you're looking for.
Watch for falling books. Eager stu
dents have been known to disappear
down here.

I was expecting something like
this when I ventured into the Iowa
Room looking‘ for Grinnell’s past,
Maybe you‘ve never heard of the
Iowa Room. I used to think it had
something to do with the Bureau of
Tourism. l0wa»ls This Heaven?

No, the Iowa Room is the home
of the Grinnell College Archives.
The stated mission of the Archives

information of permanent historical

Upon entering, I was surprised to
ﬁnd a very cozy litllc rooin With all
kinds of enticing old books lining
two of the walls.

On another wall there were three
huge maps

various ways, either as students or
faculty or in some other signiﬁcant
fashion,

Additionally, the archives conduct
the preservation ofmaierials in dune
get of deterioration. Ms. Klntner is
responsible for the preservation of
most books and documents in the ar-
chives and explained to me some of
the techniques involved, To begin
with, the Iowa Room and the archives
are climate-controlled to prevent de-
terioration of materials due to ad»
verse temperature and humidity lev-
els. Ms, Kintner also deacidifies cer-
tain documents and eneases them in
mylar to protect them from the air.
All these efforts are conducted With
an eye towards the future

“We’re talking about longrterm
preservation here. hopefully a few
hundred years." she said.

Indeed, a sense ofthe importance
ofGrinnell’s history was palpable in
the Iowa Room. The reading tables

1870’s en-

Maybe you’ve never
heard of the Iowa Room.
I used to think it had
something to do with the

Carnegie when it
was still the
college’s library
and the green

C o u n t y .
The remaining wall was taken up by
adoorway and a big, plate glass win:
dow opening onto another room.
Seated at a desk in the corner was
Anne Klntner, the Grinnell College
Archivist. Ms. Kintner proved to be
very friendly and helpful in answer-
ing my questions about the Archives.

She began by explaining to me
that the purpose ofihc archives is to
preserve records of all kinds related
to the function and history of the
college and the people who have

reading lamps
are authentic
replicas of the
lamps found there before the con»
struction ofBurling.

After showing me around the
Iowa Room, Ms. Kintner offered to
take me on a tour of the archives
themselves. Ah! I thought. The
cave! It turned out that the archives
were located in a large, well-lit room
situated behind the Iowa Room with
sturdy metal shelves lining its walls.
As we walked through the room
where Ms, Kintner conducts the press
ervation of materials in the archives,

S & B printed on their exteriors, It
turns out tllat the college has copies
of every issue of the S & 8 dating
all the way back paper's beginning
in 1893,

As we entered the room, I noticctl
how thick the walls were that sepa-
rated the Archivcs from the two front
rooms.

“This room hzis zi two—hour
firewall and a combination lock."
said Ms, Kinlner.

What that means is that a fire
could be raging through Burllng for
two hours and the archives would
still be safe. The stacks themselves
were filled wtih ancient looking
books and documents kept in special
acid—free cases.

We stopped next to a number of
boxes marked James Nonlian Hill.
It turns out that the author olMiirl‘ni'
oft/re Bounty was once associated
with Grinnell and that the college res
ceived many ofhis letters and papers
when he died.

“He was a ﬁghter ace in World

War I and actually dueled with the ’
Red Baion, said Ms Ki‘ntner '
When I asked her how she”
chooses which materials are worthy"
of being preserved in the archivesr"
she explained that it'sdiiricult, How»
ever, in certain cases. such as in:
voices from doorknobs purchased
during the construction of donnito-
rlcs in 1916, the decision to discard
becomes much easier. '
She also emphasized to me thail‘ ‘
she's always interested in obtaining
records and documents from student
organizations that might prove to be
historically interesting or that illus»

ltiiiisherl up my tour by thanking“
Ms. Kininer for her help and sittin
down for a few minutes with some“
old yearbooks. lis's nice to know tha‘tj
our history is safe. The archives are
open Monday through Friday from 2‘
