Leach of GOP holds

interesting Views

By Dan Bluin

First ' District Republican
Congressman Jim Leach recently
expressed views that sonic might
not cxpect from a Republican, in
nn interview. Lcach expressed a
preference for liberalism on
several foreign policy issues and
moderation on some domestic
questions, -

Leach classified his overall
political position as that of a
“moderate Republican.”
However, he described his stance
on foreign affairs as quite liberal.
He commented. “I am one of the
few Republican congressmen to
support a withdrawal of ground
troops from South Korea. I was a
co-sponsor on the recent resolution
on South Africa. 1 support the
Foreign Aid bill, which is highly
controversial.” He does not.
however, endorse the Panama
Canal treaty in its present form,
which he says most Iowans oppose.

ON THE domestic issue of
conservation. Leach remarked,
“In an Iowa context. we are heavy
energy users for three reasons.
Agriculture cnnsumes 16 per cent
of the petroleum in the state. Our
industries are surprisingly heavy
and energy-intensive. We drive
long distances to work on poor
roads. These are some fixed
energy uses we can do very little
about. Part of the energy issue is
setting the proper priorities 1
think it would be very inhumane to
deprive farmers of the fuel they
need to grow their crops.”

Leach added that most Iowans
would oppose any imposition of
taxes or rationing on gasoline,

He does feel, however, that any
reasonable person can support
taxes on gas guzzling cars,
provided that the auto industry is
given fair warning. He was one of
the few Republicans to vote
against the deregulation of natural
gas, on the grounds that given the
present shortage situation, lifting
price controls would he
irresponsible.

 

LEACII'S voting record
generally bears out his claim of a
liberal, His Stands on foreign
policy and some domestic issues
prove this liberal mindedness, But
he also shows a certain degree of
independence and Variability. His
votes frequently follow the
Republican line, as represented by
Chuck Grassley, another Iowan
representative, but they also
sometimes resemble those of
Iowan Democratic Congressmen
Neal Smith and Tom Harkin. An
example of the former case would
be his opposition to the minimum
wage hike and the Labor Law
Revision bill mat would stiffen
penalties against employers who
violate labor laws

His somewhat independent
stance is a reﬂection of the highly
mixed nature of his constituency.
This district has a higher cone
centration of universities than any
other in lowa. a large labor
population in and around
Davenport, and highly con-
servative rural elements. It has
traditionally been a swing district,
electing both Democrats and
Republicans to Congress.

TIIE OUTCOME of the _ tore
thcoming congressional race is in
doubt. In a district where opinion
on the issues is so divided, personal
style is an important factor. Leach
predicted that his probable op-
ponent, Mayor David Meyers of
Coralville, “is going to make
heavily an issue of his background,

which is one, as he describes it, of »

working with his hands, as con-
trasted with his description of
mine, which apparently is one of
not working with my hands. I think
that it is best for him, not me, to
define that issue,"

When asked which issues he
would stress in the campaign,
Leach said. “I’m not sure yet I'll
basically be stressing the role of
the moderate Republican in

Alcohol referendum voted

By Doug Schultz

In an often unruly three and one half hour session,
Joint Boards voted Tuesday night to submit a
compromise alcohol policy to a campus-wide,
binding referendum, The policy significantly differs
from the one proposed by the Committee on Student
Life.

After a long discussion filled with points of order.
amendments to amendments and substitute
motions to substitute motions, JOlnt Boards finally
voted 15-54 to adopt an alcohol policy drafted by
SGA President Jon Neiderbach and Vicerpresident
Linda Cornelius, The board then approved an
amendment by Jim Stuart to place the proposal
before the student body in a referendum which will
most likely be conducted Mon, Nov. Zil or Wed. Nov.
:iti.

TIIE ADOPTED policy states that there shall be
no open hard liquor bars at allrcampus events.
Instead, hard liquor may be distributed at all-
campus events through a ticket exchange system
which splits costs between SGA and the student.

The exact proposal states that “cacli student of
legal drinking age may obtain drink tickets from
the sponsors of the event. Every student of age will
be entitled to pick up two lree drink tickets: ad-
ditional drink tickets may be purchased in advance
of theﬁay of the event at a cost set such that the
receipts from ticket sales will cover as much as
possible the cost of the liquor for the additional
drinks.” .

THE PROPOSAL flcfincs all»campus events as
“all events open to all students and that take place
in Darby Gym or a place of similar capacity ac-

 

cording to fire satety standards.”That definition
makes the policy applicable to Quad and Cowles
dining halls but not to Loose or Younker Lounges,

'rhe CSL policy proposal simply stated that
“funds collected through the student activities fee
will not be used to purchase hard liquor for all-
campus cvents " it contained no specified proposal
or guidelines {or distribution of hard liquor at allr
campus events, leaving the question up to the in
dividual sponsorsThe committee’s proposal
developed out of a concern that the free hard liquor
bars help to create an atmosphere that encourages
alcohol abuse.

THE JOINT Bani-ti policy, Cornelius said, still
effects a moderating influence on the consumption
of alcohol and encourages people to “think ahead of
time about how much they are going to drink."

it approved in referendum, this policy will
become official SGA policy, If not, SGA will
reconsider the matter Wednesday night. having the
option of adopting the defeated proposal, making a
new one or adopting no policy,

(ISL will decide whether or not to concur with
vliatevei- cmcrges as official SCA policy. If it
concurs, that csnscn proposal will go to President

Math gains faculty 8 of

By DanBluni

After nille consecutive years of
rising enrollment, the Grinnell
College mathematics department
has added a new position to be
filled next year. Although a Job
description was circulated earlier
to meet deadlines in journals
listing job offers, the decisron has
only recently been finalized by the
administration.

The Job description advertises
lor an assistant professor-7
instructor ulio has completed, or is
close to acquiring a Ph.D The
applicant must show evidence of
sound scholarship and excellence
in teaching. He or she must be
interested in teaching a variety of
math courses within the Liberal
Arts framework and must have
some experience With computers.

THE NEW position will be filled
at the expense of a position in
another department, The ad
ministration will decide which
department to cut soon. after
consulting faculty recom»
mendatlons (Ind deliberations

'I‘IIE expansion of the math
department is taking place in
light of nille years of increasing
enrollment in mathematics of
fcrings, This year's enrollment,
over 450 students, includes roughly
half of LhPJI'eSIInI‘dII class. This is
generally seen as a very positive
trend.

'I‘III‘I iidiiitioii ol the new position
makes permanent what has
been adopted as a short term
solution to the problem or overly
large classes in the lower level

math sections. Faculty on leave
have had their positions filled by
replacements, something which is
not normally done, and a temr
porary professor has been hired to
help distribute the teaching load, It
is this position that will become
permanent starting next year.

The addition ofithe new position
Will not result in a substantial
increase of course offerings. What
it will do is help alleviate the
burden created for math faculty by
the growing interest on the part of
non-majors in lower level math
and computer science courses.
However, a slight expansion of
computer science offerings, now
being taught as a shared overload
beyond normal teaching
requirements, is foreseen for the
future,
