A GRID LOSS: Football stock for
next season to say nothing of
basketball and track stock for
this season took a drop of several
points this week when it was
found that Lefty Sory, sophomore
athlete, is suffering from muscle
ossification, which in plain Eng-
lish is a hardening of the muscles
. . Sory suffered acute charley
horses during the past grid sea-
son, which accounts for the pres-
ent ailment . . He cannot, ac-
cording to the doctors who ex»
rayed him this week, participate
in any form of athletics for six
months at least.

A GRID HIGHLIGHT: The ap-
pearance of Pudge Heifelfinger at
the football banquet of the Quar-
terbacks club Tuesday night was
a highlight of the fall season i i .
called the greatest running guard
of all time, Heffelfinger has been
activily interested in rootball
since his graduation from Yale

knife and f . trail ,

ALL—CONFERENCE TEAMS: We
are inclined to frown on the
method of selecting the Des
Moines Register‘s all-conference
team . i . By the time they are
through picking the men for all
the positions they have chosen, the
Register has listed practically
every man on every Midwest
squad , . For instance, Ripon
placed seven men of their 11
starters on either the first or
second team Too many names
fail to make the selection inter—
esting . . , However, the coaches
and sports writers did pay tribute
to Grinneli’s ‘forward wall by plane
ing four men on the first allrcon-
ference team

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

New York Alumni To Attend Vespers

Grinnell Grads
Plan Repeal
Of Service

The Gl‘innell college Vesper
tradition will be tlansplallted
over £1 thousand miles next
Sunday, when Pioneer alumni
in the New York city area rc-
produce a typical Grinnell vesper
semce.

The service will take place in
the Madison Avenue Presbyterian
church at 4:30 p. m.

Three former Grinnellians, Dr.
Frederick E. Bair, who is now
superintendent of schools in
Bl'onxviile, New York; Rev, H,
Reed, Milehum, New Jersey; and
Rev. G. R. Lockwood, Tenaﬂy,
New Jersey; will be in charge
of the service.

Bair Is Speaker.

Dr. Bair will be the principal
speaker and Reverends Reed and
Lockwood will assist in the ritual.

Sabcth Mix, former member of
the Grinnell Glee club and choir.
and now a resident of New York
City, will direct a choir compos—
ed of alumni who were singers in
the Glee club and vesper choir
while in school.

coffee and doughnuts, served
cafeteria style, will comprise the

day morning, according to Kent
Hampton, president of the Stu~
dent Council.

Breakfast will be served be-
tween 7:30 and 7:50 a. m, he
stated, and students and faculty
are requested to obtain food and
carry it to their respective
classes.

"No breakfast will he served
in the dormitory or quadrangle
so those students not having 8.00
o'clock’s should go to any class
in session, and eat there," he

professor, however, is his expert
mcntal research. Interested for
several years in the Joule-Thomr
son effect 7 which measures tem-
perature change taking place in
sudden expansion or contraction
of materials 7 Gale has arranged
a laboratory in Goodnow tower.
With special equipment built for
him in the physics shop at the
University of Wisconsin, he is
studying this effect in metals.

"When a weight is suddenly ap-
plied to a wire, the wire stretch-
es, and a change in temperature
momentarily takes place. My job
is to measure the change in temp-
erature each time, and to develop,
if possible, some general rule cone

however. The vibration caused by
trains passing through campus
was one of Gale’s toughest prab~
lems until six of Mrs, Gale's pie
pans solved everything. with the
pans filled \vith heavy lubricatr
ing oil and arranged near the
delicate instruments, the vibra-
tions are absorbed, and lab hours
must no longer be controlled by
train schedules.

Maintaining a constant temper-
ature in his work room has been
another major problem. With his
whole experiment hinging on ac-
curate measurements, Gale has
installed a special recording ther—
mometer which charts room tem-
perature for 24 hours, showing
the periods most advisable for
experimentation work.

A sixsfoot metal cylinder sur-
rounding the wire nsed for one
perimonts is another temperature
control. A circulating stream of
water, passing through this cyl-
inder, keeps the wire itself at a
uniform temperature.

Gales 'first findings on the ef—
fect in metals have been publish-
ed in the Proceedings of the Iowa
Academy of Science in 1940, after
he made a report to the academy
on his work.
