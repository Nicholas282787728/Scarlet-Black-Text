It's hard to miss this guy whose back and
shoulder muscles are barely disguised within
his Grinnell letter jacket. Of course, he is
Patrick Thomas, or more commonly known
amongst his friends as PThom (pronounced
Pee—Tom).

Hailing from st.
Louis, MO, Thomas
came to Grinnell on a
whim after he looked at
the school as encouraged
by his parents. He was a
recruit for both the water
polo team and swim team,
and while staying as a prospie, he hung out
with members of the swim/polo team and
watched "Boondock Saints" at Swimmer
House on movie night. With such a quality
movie impressed upon him, in addition to
the great company, Thomas could not resist
coming to the College.

Athletics has been a large part of

Thomas's life at Grinnell, as he has been an
active member of both the water polo team
and the swim team. He explained that he
has had a strong passion for water polo since
high school. which was the reason he kept
swimming even though he didn't particularly
enjoy the swimming itself.
This year he was named
to the Heartland Division
ﬁrst team and was co-
captain and cercoach
of the mter polo team,
which finished fifth at
Nationals.

“water polo and swimming have been a
pretty significant portion of my time here,"
Thomas said. “Even when I didn't want to go
to practices it was still worth it to go hang
out with people Swim team, I just enjoy the
community so much, to hang out with my
friends at the pool for two hours and then eat
dinner with them." - -

Outside of athletics, Thomas is involved
in the Christian Science Organizations, a
part of his upbringing, and enjoys movies in
his free time. He has about 200 movies in
his room as part of his extensive collection
of quality cincma He also likes to find TV
series to watch and stick with, such as sci-
fi shows “Eureka" and “Stargatc,” and more
mainstream shows like “V"nnd “Heroes."

Having an inquisitive personality and an
economics major, Thomas is interested in
what goes on behind the scenes in running
companies. onjunc 28,he will begin his new
job as a financial analyst at Stlfel Nicolausia
financial services company headquartered in
St. Louis, where he Will be able to experience
ﬁrsthand and be a part of the inner workings
ofcompanies.

“I ask a lot ofouestions because i always
want to know what’s going on and understand
everything,"Thoinas said,

Guided by his everrpresent iPhone,
Thomas can also be a useful source of
information, especially if you're looking to
learn about the Athletics Phase ll project.
He has visited the new building in progress
a number of times with Erin Hurley,
Physical Education and Swim Coach, since
construction began in April 2008. Apparently,
the project has had a mysterious allure for
Thomas that he can’t quite put into words,

“I think i probably know more about
the Athletics Phase ll project than any other
student at this school,” Thomas said. “I’ve
been over in the new building a number of
times in progress It interests ine,I don’t really
know how [0 describe it."

An interesting fact about Thomas
is that he has gone through a dramatic
transformation from his first year self to his
fourth year self One might describe this
change as going from “dry" to “wet" after
December 10, 2008, which just so happened
to be the day he turned the big two-one.

“It just took some time to adjust from
being, id say, relatively sheltered in high
school to being completely independent,”
Thomas said. “It took a little while for me to
be like, yea I can go out, and have a couple
beers. I’v: broadened my horizons. 1 may go
out on weeknights a little more than I did my
freshman year. May or may not But it's
been phenomenal.”

After spending four years at this fine
institution, Thomas is dubious about
graduating and ultimately leaving Grinncll
behind. He plans to keep in touch with the
life»long friends he has made in college and
visit the College forvarious alumni functions
including 10/10, Swim Team Alumni
Weekend and Block Party.

“i’m really excited to be done with paper
writing and schoolwork but I'm really not
that excited to leave," Thomas said. “How
often do you get be with all your friends on a
daily basis and hang out with them and stuff?
it's all coming to an end, so fast"
