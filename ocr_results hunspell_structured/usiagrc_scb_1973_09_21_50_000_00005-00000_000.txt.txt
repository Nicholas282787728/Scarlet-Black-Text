i am a history major, but history,
especially American history, is very
often a very embarassing study lor
me. This is because ot a pattern; a
recurring pattern in America which
bears out a schizoid tendency in my
people. Look at the history ol the
blacks in America. It is a process-
ion of black leaders oi greater and
lesser impact. but the leaders were

all insane. Look at the lis. Tou—
ssaint, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner,
right up to Martin Luther King and
Malcomb x, all were totally out of
touch with reality and somehow their
antic misconceptions and comicmi-
sadventures are enough to make us
reasonable Negroes hang our heads

To the Editors:

Three cheers forRiCk Nightingale.
After last week’s letter, I must say
that 1 sure sleep better now, know-
ing that Mr. Nightingale is outthere
making my moral decisions ior me.
To think of the restless nights when
I had to do ityfor myself. I must
also congratulate Rick for attack-
ing Bob Shields and his wishy washy
solution of individual determinism.
The nerve of Shields to assert that
individuals have a right to make
up their oWn' minds. Yes, siree,
we’ve got to nip wrong thinking
like that in the bud. If we let people

, like Shields have their way, Grins
nellians might actually, heaven tors
bid, start thinking for themselves.
And who knows, crazies likeShields
and those individualists might actu-
ally start making up their minds
on issues by hearing two sides, and
good God, using their own thinking

processes and reason to decide a
stand. 1 tor one am mightly glad
to have leaders like Rick and those
fourteen other wonderful SGA lead-
ers, to spare me from those wishy
washy solutions like individualfrees
dom, and all the wrong thinking
cropping up on campus.

in shame Let us take cases inpoint.
First, let us examine one Nat
Turner. Turner was a slave. Now’
i know that it can be statistically
proven that to be a slave in antes
bellum Virginia was a good deal
worse than being a Jew in Nazi
Germany, yet this was no reason
for Turner’s actions, instead of
attempting to redress his grievances
by petitions to his “massa,” and
without going through the proper
bureaucratic form - in fact, without
even so much as fair warning --
he begins a slave insurrection. The
problem that in order to be succ—
essiul, he must’“oii” the entire
state of Virginia is inconsequential
to him, but because his plot is a
bit too ambitious he fails and every
self-respecting Negro in the state
is disgraced. The rest are flogged.
Or a more recent example is one
Martin Luther King. instead of res
conciling himself to things as they
were, as any right-thinking Negro
would have, he irrationally refused
and started to stir up trouble on
such ridiculous assumptions as: law
is the agent of justice, and in order
for it to rightly serve its master
it must be even handedly executed;
law should be a solid, unbendable

1- C - from page 4
says that the racial name Negro
is to be capitalized while the name
black goes in lower case. Nice.
The editor explains the same thing
happens with the words “white”
and “Caucasian.” only I wish to
explain there is a difference. The
word white is seldom used as a
noun, While black constantly meets
this use. Besides Mr. Wylie easily
passes tor a Caucasian, whereas,

not in any way resemble a Negro.

entity rather than_lhe fluid play—
toy or those in power that it is;
America should “rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed,”
and that he could “save Amerlca's
soul” by rousing its conscience irom
its deathellke sleep, by allowing his
head to lie clubbed, hls body to be
sprayed by fire hoses, and police
dogs to tear his flesh, as well as
being thrown in jail for no crime
other than demanding civil rights
under the Constitution (a treasonous
offense if ever I heard of one).
He soon learned that in America
a liberal is someone who cries
bitter tears before he drives a
bulldozer over prostrated black hos
dies. He died with his “abiding
faith in America” shaken, but irrr
ationally intact.

The people were made, yet one
thing is to be remembered about
these “crazy Niggers.” No matter
how senseless their deaths were,
their lives were never wasted. Nat
taught us to light, but that tight-
ing alone is never enough, that we
must have with us also the power
and glory that come with our spir-
itual awareness of ourselves and
our God. Martin taught us that spir
ritual strength alone is not enough,
that' we must be willing to fight,
as all the ‘crazy niggers so might-
ily illustrate, to die to gain, our
birthright as Americans. That is
why, I think, that we have Black
Cultural Weekend. In order to re-
mind lus to cultivate that insanity
in ourselves and our Brothers and
Sisters that someday we might be
free.

by Michele Eothenberg
Lately I’ve had the fortune and
necessity to travel around lowa.
Fortunate for two reasons -- I had
the chance to see lowa, and, also,
to escape the epidemic at Grinnell.
Actually though, lowa had the poten-
tial to be one of the most beautir
ful states in the country, it simply
must be Viewed at the right time.
This (all has definitely been one
of the most spectacular seasonsl’ve
witnessed, and it has really only

begun.

The original surprise was in re
turning to lowa this year, expects
ing to see the normal shades or
brown and finding instead the bright
greens of Calitornia. This beauty
has not faded and each trip out-
side ol Grinnell again amazes me.
It may seem like a rather common-
place occurance to be excited about,
but some scenes compel contem-
plation.

Although it is late in coming the
seasonal metamorphosis seems to

be beginning. As fall approaches the
dark greens are reluctantly being
Sublimated by other shades. The
look of warmth and depth in the
scenery provides moments to cherv
ish.

Iowa has some of the best sunsets,
moonrlses, and starlights around.
One experience that nobody should
miss is sitting on top of a green,
grassy hilltop watching the sun play
With its rainbow colors, creating
massive Collages of melting pastel
colors. Then slowly, as the blues
and greens begin to swallow the
yellows, pinks, and oranges, the
stars will start to fade in', Simmon-
ing the moon. on special nights the
moon appears cloaked in orange,
swollen past normal size. Soon the ’
masque is shed and the moonquick-

clear air complements the star.
struck Sky as they combine for the
finale.

ln essence reflecting onlowa’s bea-
uty leads me to the realization of
the tremendous impact living here
has had upon me. lowa is not_just
a part oi the vague midwest. The
aesthetic beauty of this state during
certain seasons is unforgettable.

I used to think that every student
at Grinnell was fairly equal. No
prima donnas, no BMOC’s, ho ath-
letic heroes, no one conspicuously
more prominent than the rest. it
took the following incident to finally
drag me out of my delusion.

Derek King, a good iriend of mine,
was visiting campus all last week.
To many people, Derek was here,
just like the rest of us, about to
begin another year in captivity.
Little did they know that Derek was
parolled a year early to enter Co-
lumbia Law School. '

Derek was here just long enoughto
become a target for those iemales
who prefer to enter the jungle,
hunting only for big game. After
he had left, one girl after another
would walk up to me and ask where
he was There was this one in par—
ticular whose persistence still as-
tounds me.

The first time she approached me,
she coyly asked it I knew where
Derek King was. She added that she'
had never really focused on me,
but that she thought it was me who
was with Derek a few times.

I thanked her tor associating me
with royalty and admitted that it‘
was indeed me, a meager court
jester, whom she had seen with
Derek. I even felt sorry that I had
to inform her that her heartthrob
was no longer with us, that he was
enrolled in the Germ of the Ocean,

She seemed perplexed, but thanked
me and walked off to chart a new
battleplan.

It couldn’t have been a day later

when she approached me with the
same question. "Can you tell me
where I might iind Derek King?"

“Try New York, NewYork 10028,”
i muttered, probably becauselwant—
ed to get to know her but felt that
anyone other than Derek King would
merely be a road map to her. As
gain, 1 related the biography of
Derek King, irom the moment his
first hair appeared on his chest
until the day he left Grinnell Col-
lege emphasizing the latter event
An hour later, I passed her in
the iorum. She was gazing about,
not much differently than anyone
else. i finally came into her line
of vision. She recognized me, a
triumph for anonymity, and strole
led over to say hello.

Wrong again The moment i was
within earshot. she greeted me with
“one of my iriends mentioned that
she had seen Derek King a few
days ago. Would you know where
he might be now?”

That was it. I consider myseli
a patient soul. Maybe i hadn’t are
ticulated lucidly. No,- i had told
her twice before, quite explicitly
that Derek King was no longer a
part of her, or anyone else’s, Grins
nell experience.

”Since we have spoken together
three times now, i teel justified
in asking your name.”

”Virginia, but my friends call me
Jinny.”

“O.K,, Virginia, you are a college
student now, you must know how to
spell...You do know how to spell?“

“Yes, i do. Why?," She squeeked.

“Can you iind the word ‘scar' in
Scarlet?”

“S-Crarr, yes, the word ‘scar’ is
in scarlet.”

“Alright, now, can you locate the
word ‘lack’ in Black?”

“Sure, ‘lack' is lnthewordblack.“

“Good, now, can you find the word
‘FUCK’ in Derek King?"

She thought a moment, looked at
her shoes, inquisitively gazed back
up and answered, emphatically, .
”NO, there ain’t no ‘fuck’ inDerek

King.”

"That's what I’ve been tryin’ to
tell youl There ain't no fuckin’Derek
King!"

Yes, Virginia, all'that for the
punchline.
