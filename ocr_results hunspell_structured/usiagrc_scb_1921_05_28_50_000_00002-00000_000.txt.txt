r011 DISTINGUISHED SERVICE

Among other customs and traditions
carried on in Grinnell college. a no-
table one has been that of awarding
service medals to the two senior men
and the two senior women who have
proven themselves or the greatest all
around nseiulness to the college dur—
ing their four year course. The basis
tor this award has generally taken
into account scholarship, athletic
ability. literary interests. religious ac»
tivity, and grade 0! leadership in col-
lege activities and very general inter—

;held each spring to

determine the

winners at these much coveted
medals.
Recentlya suggestion was mllde
that such medals encouraged too Diall)‘
outside interests tor the individual

student and that the awards

services. The Scarlet and Black
titude. and to review the benefits (0
be derived from the custom.

Like all other Grinncll tradition.
this service award has come to hold
a high place in the esteem oi nil col-
lege men and women and has been n
definite goal toward which all stur
denm struggle. It has provided
definite standard for
achievement and has done much to
spur upperclassmen on to greater ens
deavors in order that they may be cl
greater service to their alum mate;
It is quite possible that a sci-lice
EWEl'd does act as an incentive for
varied activities. but this. in itself. is
not a detriment but a valuable addie
tion to regular scholastic work. for it
is a generally accepted theory that
well directed outside activities help
to make a wellsrounded and Vel'silllle
man. The student who can pal
pate in varied ﬁelds and at the sume
standard (if

of special

n

time maintain a high
scholarship is deserving
recognition and this is pl‘OVldeLl by
the medals. Past elections have gen-
erally disproven the popularity award
theory and it is conceded hy studenrs
and alumni that the service melliil is
the most truly deserved and llie most
representative honor conferred by line
college. '

Since the establishment of the Casi
tom some five years ago. the Student
Council, togeLller with the CDlIZK‘il
iaculty committee, has been to son—
era] charge of the elections. :LlLliO llliA
iunds have come from outside sourc
\Vth the suggestion that the awards
he discontinued, the Council decided
to take the matter up With the fac. 3'
and has worked out a plan wile or
the Council not only has charge or
the elections and determines ills
method Of selection. but. also pl'm'idcs
the funds tor the medals. This plan
means mat the service award Will lJOV
come, more than ever hetore, a truly
distinctive honor conferred on the
senior men and women who shall he
adjudged roost deserving of it. Such
an award will heanother step in the
building up of 8. better and gi’calcl‘
Grinnell and as such should reclaim
the iuli support or hoth students and
faculty.
