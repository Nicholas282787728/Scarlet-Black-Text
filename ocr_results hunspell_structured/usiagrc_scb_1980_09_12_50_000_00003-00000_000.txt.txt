SGA budgetary woes

by Winston Kreuler

"There is hardly an area in the Stu-
dent Government Association that now
has adequate lunding," remarked
Social Coordinator Chris Nylander. His
comment was predicated by the iailure
to raise the 197980 Student activity fee
to compensate tor the rising rate oi in-
flation. Because 01 the static activity
iee, many services which SGA provide
are threatened by decreases in quanti-
ty, their quality, or both.

SGA's major source oi income is the
373 student activity tee which every stu
dent pays as part oi tuition. The capital
with which SGA can work this year is
slightly less than last year‘s 3101.392.
tExact iigures tor this year‘s budget
are not yet availablel SGA Treasurer
Sharon Rauland illustrated the dil-
{iculties the unincreased budget poses
by saying, “It is very diiiicult when
your expenditu es are inflated and your
income is not."

Although uiis year's enrollment in-
creased by 20 to 30 students, the midi
tional activity iees do not compensate
for the amount which inflation has
devalued this year's budget. Further-
more, some at SGA's minor sources of
income were not as large as had been
expected, so the additional activity fees
only help to make the current budget
closer to the '73330 budget.

Since 1968, tuition has risen every
year; activity tees have risenonly {We
times The 1980-81 actiVity tee is Only 1
percent of total tuition, the lowest
percentage in the last 12 years. It this
percentage ol tuition were currently
L77 percent, the rate in 1968, activity
iee per person would run approximate
ly mo. it the percentage were the 1,2
percent of last year, activity lee would
run approximately 58!

President George Drake and Ex-
ecutive Vice President Wally Walker
both felt that the reason the acthlty lee
was not raised was that no such requesl
was made by students or SGA before
the (all Trustee Board meeting Though
last year's SGA President David
Kramer did make an iniornial request
at the winter board meeting. Walker
points out that this was both too late and
the wrong way to go about requesting
such a raise,

Walker added that there 15 a specific
process that students should follow it

remarked Trustees are very sensitive
to the needs or student organizations,
but it is up to the students to make the
request expressmg the need ior more
money.

SGA President Paul Volker realizes
that the Trustees will not raise the ac”
tivity fee of their own volition. As they
must be petitioned ior any other budget
change, they must be petitioned to ins
crease the activity fee. He and SGA
vice President John Conyers plan to
present therr case to Walker before the
lall board meeting.

Volker attributes the failure to re
quest an increase in the actiVity iee last
year to the raise that occurred the year
before When 1978-79 SGA President
Greg Youtz took oiiice in the tail oi 1973,
he saw how inadequate the budget was.
Youtz managed to getan increase in the
$65 actiVity iee so the coming years
SGA would have suiflClent funding.
When Kramer took office in the fall of
1979, there was no evidence oi insuiii-
cient iunding because the increased ac-
tivity fee had brought the SGA a much
larger supply of capital, when budget
problems did arise, and Kramer went
to the Trustees, It was too late to “1'
crease the fee.

Essentially, the problem in this
year‘s budget is that costs have gone up
monumentally Inflation has devalued
this year's budget even though it is ap~
proximately the same dollar amount as
last years, However, the problem is
compounded because most of the items
which SGA services spend money on

suffer the effects of inllation severely
and have a rate of inflation above that
oi the national average, Films and cone
certs are two prime examples oi such
inflation-sensitive items.

Films Committee CoVChairman Peter
Ruderman is encountering the eiiects
oi the tightened budget “The iact that
the budget is the same as last year's
means that we must select a larger
number of films from the '405. '505 and
’GOs However, students prefer seeing
the more recent films," Commented
Ruderman,

F. Hudson Miller, former Films Com-
mittee Chairman, described the rate of
inilation in the movie industry as a
popular feature iilm rising irom 3400 to
$500 per rental to over $750 in the past
three years shipping and student labor
rates have also risen accordingly, and
most movie companies now demand an
percent oi the cost oi the movie ior ad
ditional showings. Miller concluded by
saying, “Failure to match the film l‘un»
ding with the rate of inflation will make
it difficult to keep Grinnell's iilm pro-
gram going at its present quality."

Perhaps hardest hit by the devalued
budget are the Mayor and Minor Con-
certs Committees' allocations. Both
current budgets are less than what they
were last year Major Concerts Chairs
man Daniel Fielding pointed out that
four years ago to percent oi SGA’s
funds were allotted for Concerts Since
then, the proportion oi money which the
concerts program has received has
