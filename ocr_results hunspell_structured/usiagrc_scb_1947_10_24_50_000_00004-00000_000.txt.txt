Le’r’rers To
The Edi’ror

Dear Editor,

Last week there was much ado
in this column about the crowded
barracks conditions \iiider which
Loose liall girls were living prior
to evacuation to our new home,

There was a definite [ire haz—
ard in Read basement, it is
true. Perhaps we all awoke one
morning or another thinking we
had accidentally crawled into a
mole": home instead of our own.
me had a hard time finding a‘
place to cram for Mr. Baiuiiaiiii;'
and dehydration, for a while, did
seem to be the only answer to
the closet shortage. '

Yet we feel that our gains
more than equal our losses, Good
times are not limited to luxurious
quarters. By sharing conveniences
and inconveniences alike, ivc each
developed a new awareness of the
meaning of cooperation andgroup
living,

We are moving into a building
superior in every respect — well
worth our temporary discomiort.
Ca. t all of us accept this ex-l
perience with the good sports-
manship that characterizes the
Grinnell spirit?
