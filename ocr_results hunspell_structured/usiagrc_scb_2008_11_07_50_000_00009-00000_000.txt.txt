I may be sketchy, but not as sketchy as these people

Harsha Sekar ’08 shares his awkward experience on 10/10 as a witness to first-years having sex in public

It’s always a treat to v’ 't the ofﬁce of Professor
Ed Cohri A kind, unassuming rnaii, Professor Colin
goes out or his way to downplay lrrs ilnplesslve inter
let-t and dilrgente,

The other day, winle risrtrng about a recornmern
d.rtron,l noticed a slendel yet tantalizing volume on
his bookshelf. The book was titled Sex in Pri/i/ir.

“Set in Pub/it?“ said, abruptly. (We were in the
midst ota conversation about the grad school applica~
tion process).

“Hmm?”He nttcred,

“Is that a good boo P Do you like that book”

“It's okay," he said, and went on to provide a pithy
scholarly ctitiquc, scrutinizing the exceedingly theOr
tytladcn rhetoric ofwhat was apparently a Soviet hist
toty textbook.

Most people, I don’t think, have evel engaged in
Sex in public. Intereourse,atleast aiound here,genei~
ally seems to take place in an intentionally intimate
setting. But for those of you, like me, who chose to
partake in last months festivities, known as 10/10, Sex
In PllMic transcends mete theory arid rhetoric,

During the campus shot, my friend stove Hoff
and lIWitncsscd an interaction tliat
most people worrid regard as abt
surd. Two firstryeats lay on Mac
Field fully clothed, the man on his
back, the woman on top of irrm,
with one hand stroking his hair

needed some assistance in or er to

prnpoint the proper term), it known as “The Cow-

girl Position" or “The Revcr Missionary P on,"

neatly combined with kissing, caress

and ernbraerng." (The website also contained a help

ﬁrl protrne, whreh almost perfectly resembled the
tirst~years in the act).

we didn‘t realize they were i‘rrs-rtytars. Admitted
ly, it would have been wise to stop for a moment and

”Who other than ﬂirt—year:
won/d 50 brazen/y display their

appa/iligyudgemem?”

think logicallyiwho utliel than firsttyeals worrld so
brazenly display their underdeveloped

hormones, their appalling judgment"

But rather than consider this, Steve

was certain these people \vele people

he knew, and that they were in tact se-

rrrors, with whom he was friends,

He ran towards the \vouldtbe pcnetrarrng partner,
grabbed his upper-hip, and began to tickle him vigt
orousiy, while simultaneously making a Iiightpitched,
squealing no, ,

“Vi/hat the "k’l" the man yelled

“Vi/hat the hell are you doing?"sliouttd the totem
ing partner.

They looked at l‘lllTlt and he looked at them. They
weren’t who he thought they were. Steve lapsed into
repeated apology and frantic explanation.

“That‘s okay, it’s 10/10," the couple smiled and
told him, before going on with their excessively pro-
tected sex.

As the two ofus walked away trom the situation,
I came to a humblrrrg truth, a revelation ityou will: I
may be sketchy, but not as sketchy as these people.

Later on in the evening, a
little bit after nirdnight,l noticed
another ﬁrsttycat couple, They
were in Gardner. One partner
used her hands to press her corn
panron's- e closer to hers, while
he leaned his whole body rrrto her,
licking her mouth repetitively.

When I saw Steve, he pointed out that there were
several of these couples and admitted that he felt out

the exact same way.

I’m an alumnus, but after three years ofcollege,l
still don’t think I’m able to have sex in public. I didn't
onioy the party, but it wasn't because 1 had already
graduated.

i had telt this way on several occasions through
out my time as an undergraduate. i suppose I haven't
matured, haven't gained any confidence over the last
three years. But mainly, I felt like a dork. A clueless,
perplexed dork.

apartment.

We sipped on beer from my fridge and began to
talk. While our conversation started out as a gland
consensus about oul shared sketchy experience, we
soon started talking about race and im igtation. And
then we talked about Muhammad AliJinnah and the
Partition of Pakistan, and wiry de l<ooning painted
his best during the splingtime.

We had reverted back into our comfort nc, our
inherent dorkiness, which was a long way from the
glamour and c itemerrt or the party, And soon Emit

Things we love: closure in Student Affairs and our bodies

Where is Sheree Andrews?

On Sept. 4, Assoeiate Dean and
Director of Residence Life Sheree
Andrews was run
expectedly put
on administrative
leave. Students
learned about
the incident after
RLCs informed
student staff the night Andrews was
placed on leave.

Though the circumstances that led
to the event remain unclear, the conse
quences have had a considerable effect
on student attaits and eampus in gen-
eral as Andrews remains on leave.

Without the return of Andrews ot
the lilting ora replacement, a hole has
been left in Student Affaits that has yet
to be filled.

Thus, her administrative duties

Staff'Editorial

have been transferred to other moms
bers of Strident Affairs. This of course
has caused other employees to take on
an extra workload that
they should not he re-
qrriredro do, An ews'
past responsibilit
chided handling,r alcot
hol contracts, acting as
adviser to Lyle's- Pub,
and overseeing RLCs amongst various
other duties.

Until Andrews either returns or a
replacement is hired, things will remain
spread thin in student Attarrs,

While we understand why the
reasons for the administrative leave
are conﬁdential, after more than two
months, it is time for some form of act
tron to be taken.

The fact that students now have to
go to multiple members ofStudent Af-

fairs to reserve servrees that they not
mally would got from the Director of
Residence Life is not beneficial to the
campus cotnrnunitv

The uncertainty is not helpful to
anyone involved in this matter sni-
dcnt Affairs should resolve this issue as
soon as possible so that nor-malty can
return.

Love your body festivities

Many great things eome only
ones a yeiitihitthdays, annrversar-ies,
lO/loiand Love Your Body Week,

or course, we're always ecstatic
about these events but this time, it
wasn’tjustbecause it gave us something
to do.

Organized by the Feminist Aer
tiorr coalition, Love Your Body Week
is a time to feel connected with other
people interested in the removal otste-

r-conipes, and no other event on campus
can boast a schedule as attractive as the
one we had this week: feminist porn,
naked yoga, mastrrrbatron workshops,
and a naked rnaich, wrth the mucl‘r
anticipated dlag show held tonight,

in addressing topics that would
normally make a arsteyear student
blush, nothing was taboo yet, the week's
events wctc fat mote comfortable than
the awkward talkwith the parents about
the birds and the beesiand that's wiry
we love Grinnell,

The freedom to express ourselves
through our discussions about the body,
mastuib 'on techniques, and naked
yoga positions—it empowers us.

We hope you took advantage of this
treasured week that only comes once
every twelve months and remember
to love your body all year, not just this
week,
