AGﬁleﬂl! a Fair Trial.

On Monday the members of the Jun-
ior class will be called upon to select
1mm its members those who will tour
stltnte the predominant portion of the

new College Council. It is possible

that there are those in the Junior
class who have not favored such a

plan as was adopted or who tor other
reasons are a triﬂe apathetic toward
the election. Sllcll should not be the
case. The plan having been adopted
by a preponderance of student opinion
is entitled to a fair trial, which can
only he had by choosing next year's
Senior representative wisely and well.
The Juniors who give their best Ill:
tention to this election will render the

College ti real S9l'rice.

an affair as took place Thursday night
when Freshmen attempted to rectify
by the hazing method summsed defects
in other Freshmen. The affair is a

one, as to which members of the class
