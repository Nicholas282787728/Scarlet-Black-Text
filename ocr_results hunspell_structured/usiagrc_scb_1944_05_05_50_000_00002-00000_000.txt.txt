No Fun. No No’rhin' - -

Look, kids, things are tough all over. Trile,
we have to live right here, right now, and
it doesn’t help much to think that not
many people ailywhere are having a won—
derful time. Maybe it even makes the
prospect more depressing But chee, those
of us who are spending our last springr
under these lonesome oaks would like to
carry away with us the memory of a place
that was something more than moribund.

No, we aren’t fomenting revolution, We
aren’t asking you to break one teeny rule
efar from it. We are, rather, asking you
to exercise a little pep and initiative in
those spheres of activity which are free
from positive as well as negative regula-
tion, namely: your own attitude.

We have never had compulsory chapel
or college church in this institution; we
have very few compulsory meetings; and
it’s skin off nobody's nose but yours if
you make lack of class preparation the
lule rather than the exception. But lately,
it has seemed that compulsion was going
to have to be added to a good many flint?

Do you know how hard it is to get a

can’t even get you to play!

What’s the matter? Are you just too

tions. The dozen or so people who some—
how continue to have the enthusiasm and
initiative and patience to try to organize
life around here, are going to crumple
from overwork one of these days.

At first most of the students used to

to know that deterioration sets in when
the circulation is blocked: for why is there
a tourniquet of boredom around Grinnell
student life?

We started out by saying we weren‘t
tormenting revolution. We still say we
aren't, not that even the faculty wouldn’t
agree at this point that a little overeex-
nbel‘ance is preferable to this coma. This
is your schoolﬁnot only despite the war,
but even more so because of it. So if
