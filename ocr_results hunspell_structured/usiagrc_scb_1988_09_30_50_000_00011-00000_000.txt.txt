Griffins
come up
short

by Henry Mansﬁeld

The Grinnell Grifﬁn‘s rugby
club set out from the Forum
parking lot shoniy before noon
last Sunday missing a few play»
ers, but ready to get the blood and
sweat ﬂowing. They made the
strenuous twenty minute trek al»
most ﬂawlessly, not even (for
once) losing a car along the way.

/ The game got underway and

within a few minutes, Newton
scored its ﬁrst try by battering its
way through the tough and as»of»
yet-not-tired Grinnell lines. The
Griffins quickly reelproeated,
however, on a beautiful break-
away by our friend Gary, who
steamed down four-ﬁfths of the
ﬁeld, reaching the try zone milr
Iiseeonds in front of the scarred
arid gnarled hands ofa pnrtieuarly
fast and furious Newton player.
Mark kicked one through the
posts for and extra point, and the
Grifﬁns were back in the game.

Unfortunatley, though they
pushed and gnlntod and plowed up
innumerable clumps of Newton
soil, the Grinneilians were not
able to score again and Newton
rztn off with the match, scoring
three more tries throughout the
remainder of the game. Great
play also by the afformentioned
Mark, Trevor Harris in his season
debut as a back, Elan Murphy,
and the entire Griffin semm, who
won eleven out of sixteen serumr
downs

tripped up in the corner of the
box, giving the Pioneers a
penalty shot. Being the kind—
hearted soul that he is, Lorimer
allowed teammate Simmons the
honors of cranking in the freebe.

Nil.

The Pioneers third goal came
on an indirect kick after Torn
McCullen was obstructed on a
breakaway. On a set play,
Lorimer tipped it to Simmons
who promptly chipped it over the
"wall" and past the dumbfounded
goalkeeper.

Keeping everything in the
family, Simmons was tripped up
this time, and what do 'ya know .
- inside the box. I hate it when
that happens. Returning the fa-
vor and thereby forgoing a possi-
ble hat-trick, Simmons un»
selﬁshiy relinquishtxi the penalty
shot to Lorimer. (in case you
were wondering, there were other
guys playing).

Lorimer put it past the goalie
in the lower left corner, But
wait... he didn't wait for the
whistle. Do-over (kinda like
tether-ball). Same exact thing:
goalie on ground, ball in same
spot. Sorry, forgot to wait
again. Alright, this is getting
embarassing for the poor goalie;
just concede the damn thing al-
ready. Can't do that. Third try...
ho, the opposite comer. making
the goalkeeper look silly yet
again. No flags on the play --
count it! Three shots, one goal.
Lorimcr/Simmons 4, Scots not a
thing.

The Pioneers had their sweat
fun in the rain, now it's time to
get serious. This afternoon they
host Ripon at 4:30. And then on
:Sunday it's the BIG ONE! Ripon
is definitely important (and no
walkover, either, that‘s for sure),

but Sunday's game against Coi—
orado College is for all the
enchiladas.

CC is ranked fifth in the
West, and a victory against them
would really enhance the Pier
neers' aspirations of post-season
play. Fan support is an absolute
must. I'm thinkin’, 0h, llish
Sunday morning. Come watch
our guys with the funky new
does take on those pompous,
blonde-haired mountain boys. It's
the game of the season: kinda
like our very own Tyson»Spinks
battle, except Lhis one‘s cashrfree
and guaranteed to last at least 80
minutes.

Tennis team
slips to 3—3

by Laura Whitmore

Grinneli's Women‘s Tennis had
a rough weekend, losing tough
matches to Ripon and Lake For-
est.

On Friday, the Pioneers faced
Ripon. Erika Smith won the
number one singles and Elizabeth
Banfield battled out three long
sets to emerge victorious in the
number three slot. Going into
the doubles matches, Grinnell
knew they'd have to win all three
matches to win overall. Alas! it
was not to be 77 only the number
three doubles team of Jennie
Wang and Elizabeth Banfield,
undefeated in conference play,
Could win.

All was not lost, however.
The Pioneers did get a new unir
form idea from Ripon. See, their
coach is named Charlie, so they
