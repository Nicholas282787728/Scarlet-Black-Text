Confessions from the Crinnell train jumper

Grinnell student Darwin Manning provides the 5&3 with a first-person account with his recent train accident

av DARWIN MANNING

I either had God blessing me, my Irish roots kicking in,
or both, but either way I’m lucky to be here. Everyday as
I sit currently unable to walk on my righr leg and slowly
learn how to get around campus in my state, I am still deals
ing with the consequences.

There are those certain moments in life, that although
it may sound cliche are life changing, and ones where your
life takes a dramatic new direction. This experience that
took place on March 18 at about 5 p.m. was rruly one of
those moments for me.

I realize now how colossally idiotic my decision was,
and how indestructible a force the train is that runs through
Grinnell.

Kane and I had been working on our Titular Head film
for weeks, and the part with Danger Trainithe name of
our new movie—wasn't even going to be in it. Originally,
we were making a time-travel movie.

Yet, on that’l'hursday afternoon,we both were attempt-
ing to include an extra scene, and I myself know that I
didn't listen to my conscience, that was grasping for air
against the euphoria of the moment.

I rode that ladder feeling like my boyhood hero Tom
Sawyer. Then as 1 prepared to descend, my right shoe wob—
bled and before I could think, Kane screamed “NO!"

Grasping for air in that grass I finally felt an unbeliev-
able sense ofrespecr for the Midwest and all ofits glorious
trains. I realized then rhere is no Brooklyn comparison, and
this is truly a beast worth being wary of.

With the second chance that] have been given I feel it
is my obligation to give back to the rest of society. At the
immediate time, my society or community is Grinnell Col-

lege, and therefore I feel like God wanted me to live so that
I could impact the College in a dramatic way.

1 know that ifl had died that day the College would
have been impacted, but I don't know if the feeling would
have lasted. Now thatI am alive I can for the rest of my
career at Grinnell, educate people, as a living example, {or
why jumping on the rrain is a horrible, dangerous and life»
risking idea.

I feel like it is only human for us to make mistakes in
life, and that has been proven throughout rhe history of
mankind. Although what is most important is not that you
made the mistake, but that you change your actions due to
their consequences and you truly learn that this is a mis—
take that you should never repeat again.

I realize that what happened to me that day, didn’t only
impact me, but impacted the entire Grinnell community, as
well as my family and friends back home. I want to take the
chance to apologize to everyone from President Osgood,
to Security Guard Russ, to my Cross Country Coach and
everyone in the Grinnell community and thank you all, for
helping me march onward and continue my life here.

From this experience,I feel like I have gained a new
set of grandparents, and will forever have so much love for
Nancy and A1 Maly, who took me under their arms, and
gave me a place to stay after leaving the hospital.

Finally, I would like to thank all those doctors, nurses,
ambulance personnel and police thar acted swiftly and cons
fidently in Grinnell and then at the hospital in Iowa City.

Since I returned to campus I have not watched the train
pass through, but I have visited the hospital, last Thursday,
for another surgery.

The last surgery went well, although it ended up being

seven as opposed to three hours, and I experienced horrible
nausea, and piercing pains all along my arms, because of
how my arms had been tied down.

I now have 16 pin sites, where metal connects through
leg to hone, two haloes around my lower shin, a metal ring
around my foot similar to Shaq's shoe-size and a perma
nent meral plare in my fibula

My doctor rold me on Saturday that he believes we have
a miracle on our hands, the like he is not too familiar with.
After all, the original x-rays looked like a defmire amputa—
tion, and the ones after the third surgery look much im
proved.

My best friend, Omar, who has always known me, asked
me ifI thought this would change how I have always been.
I was a risk taker, one ready for adventure, not satisfied
with staying put.

Some good that has come from these characteristics,
namely that I had the audacity to come to Grinnell Cole
lege, when many of my friends srayed near home and were
amazed that I'd go to a school in Iowa. In light of this
recent incident this trait has also brought me some very
poor results. ,

So I answered, “You know, now that I’m 13 and in my
ﬁrst year of college, I feel that it is about time that 1 tone
down my Tarzan act, and be much more cautious, but at the
same time I will not try to force myself from enjoying life,
but find the perfect balance."

Through Kane and my video, my radio show, my writing
here and the conversations I have, I want everyone to know
how much I respect rhe Grinnell train, as should all ofyou.
