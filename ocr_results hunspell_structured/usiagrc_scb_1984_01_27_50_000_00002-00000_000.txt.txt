Group will study academic pressure

by Eric Green

Instead of building another
library to accommodate the re
cent rash of diligent studying by
the student body the Grinnell
faculty and administration has
decided to form a sub-committee
to study the problem of academic
pressure. The Curriculum Com-
mittee took this action on Tuesday
on the prompting of a memorans
dum issued by Dean of the Facul-
ty Catherine Frazer.

In the memo Frazer notes that
“there will always be pressure"
but hopes that “it may be possible
to suggest some guidelines that

due to the recent resignation of
Jeanne l-lughe as Administrative
Assistant.

Hautzinger said applications
are being taken for the position,
but that the selection cannot be
made before the elections Tum-
day.

Commenting on the upcoming
elections, Hautzinger said that he
hopes there will be a big turnout in
the dorms and stressed that
everyone voting should be “aware
that their elected hall president no
longer votes only on budgets for
all-campus parties, but also on nae

will mitigate this to some extent,"
Concerns about pressure have
also been raised by the SGA
cabinet and the Student Affairs
Office.

History Professor Phillip Kinter
Will chair the subcommittee,
which also includes students
Robert Sckalar and Peter Hautz-
inger.

Kinter said that the increase in
stress is a broadly recognized pm
blem and he hopes uie committee
can come up with some recom
mendations to help relieve some
of the Stress.

Frazer's memo suggests some
possible topics for the subcommitr
tee to explore, including the ques-
tion of whether it would be
desirable to stop giving tests and
paper assignments during the last
10 days or so of classes and the
possibility of all instructors plann-
ing to assign work early in the
semester, givmg the student some
initial feedback on his or her
mastery of the course.

Although the group Will not
meet until Tuesday, Sckalar men-
tioned two other topics the com-
mittee may pursue.

tional and international issues as
well."

Making SGA more political was
an extremely controversial topic
last semester, Hautzinger said he
is “happy that now SGA has some
sort of focus on politics."

nob Sckalor, SGA treasurer,
said increasing SGA's political in
volvement is “important because
it keeps a channel open for
students to voice meir opinions on
politics."

SGA President Jon Scharif adds
ed his thoughts that, “It is ap
propriate for SGA to represent
and speak [or students" and if the
students vote in their hall elec-
tions, “then they will get the kind
of representation they want."

Cranston visits Grinnell

by Steve Canister

“We live in a very dangerous
world and we better manage our
relationship with the Soviets in
order to reduce the dangers of
nuclear war," said Presidential
hopeful Alan Cranston, who
visited the campus in mid-
Decemher, as part of his came
paign to win the Democratic
nomination for president in lost.

The 69-year~old senator from
California. who is running
somewhere behind lrontrunners
Fritz Mondale and John Glenn,
emphasized the nuclear weapons
issue to his audience in South
Lounge as he has been doing
throughout his campaign,
Cranston hopes to increase his
chances of winning the
Democratic nomination by taking
the strongest stand on arms con
trol. ’

Cranston asserted that the big-
gest problem keeping the two
superpowers from achieving
significant arms reduction stems
from past and present presidens
tial refusal to sit down with me
Soviets, talk arms control. and let
them know that this is America's
number one concern.

”i think it's outrageous that
Reagan has been President tor
three years now and hasn't said
one word to the Soviet Union yet. I
think it’s incredible that for eight
years now there hasn't been a
really serious discussion on this
[arms control] topic between the
US. and the Soviet Union," stated
Cranston.

Cranston added that, "If
elected, the first day I take officel
will ask the Soviet leader to meet
with me very soon, We wouldn‘t

get into technicalities in the ﬁrst
meeting I would hope that we
could just agree to agree.”

The problem that Cranston
faces in seeking support [or the
nomination does not seem to be
how to persuade Americans that
the nuclear issue must be address
ed, but rather how to persuade
them that he is the best Chance the
Democrats have in beating
Reagan.

“I think I have as good of a
chance, it not a better one, than
the rest of the candidates have of
beating him," said the California
senator, Cranston. whose slogan
is "Peace and Jobs,” noted.
“Reagan is vulnerable on the
economy and the peace issue.
There's the general feeling that
he’s too prone to use force.”

He also added that there are
many groups that will not support
Reagan. “Women, if you think
about their issues, are concerned
about him. Blacks won’t support
him; Hispanics won't support
him; senior citizens won't support
him, and the list goes on."

Cranston stated that a
Democrat has to carry either the
South or the West in order to win.
“That‘s the way it works every
time," he contended. “I don't
know who could do best in me
South, maybe nobody 7 that's
Reagan's stronghold. But if
anyone can beat him in die West I
can," he said.

Cranston, who lags far behind in
most polls but shows no signs of
quitting, remarked, “I've won
every otfice I’ve ever held by win-
ning a very tough race in which
most people thought I'd never
Win."

SGA will also be dealing with
important campus issues such as
academic pressures, break shut-
tlesi and the faculty cuts, Scharff
sai .

Last semester a subcommittee
was formed to study the problem
of academic pressure, Hautzinger
said he hopes the committee will
be able to make some helpful sug
gestions, He added that if not
“joint board will make some
statement" and maybe ask the
faculty to reconsider the early

drop date and buffer days.

The other “high priority“ topic
for this semester’s SGA, Hautz-
inger said, will be figuring out a
better way to run the break shuts
ties.

College ranks
13th in

post-grads

A recently released survey of
100 undergraduate institutions in
the US. ranks Grinnell College
13th in the percentage of the
school's graduates who go on to
take doctorates in their fields.

Completed as a national
research project at the College of
Wooster in ohio, the survey shows
that 827 doctoral degrees were
awarded to Grinnell graduam
during the periodlmioao.

This means that one out of every
13 BA. recipients at Grinnell ends
up with a doctorate, which is
defined in the survey as the
highest-level research degree,
such as doctor of philosophy, doc-
tor of science, or doctor of educa-
tion. The survey does not include
medical, veterinary, or other pro
fessinnal degrees.

Grinnell’s place in the upper
eighth of the ranking is higher
than that oi prestigious eastern inc
stitutions like Williams, Mid-
dlebury, Colgate, Smith, and
Vassar Colleges.

Schools included in the survey
are primarily undergraduate in-
stitutions which do not themselves
offer work toward the doctoral
degree.

1) Reinstatement of Buffer
Days and a revision of the
deadlines for dropping a couise
and/0r switching to Pass/Fail
grading,

2) An agreement whereby
course instructors would not re-
quire any more work besides mat
which is specified in the syllabus.

Sckalar was optimistic that the
subcommittee would make pro-
gress on most of the preliminary
suggestions but noted that the
faculty still appeared reluctant to
change the calendar to reinstate
buffer days. lie said he was en-

couraged that President Drake
has taken a personal interest in
the question.

In the past two years Sckalar
has been active in trying to per-
suade the administration and
faculty to reexamine the buffer
days issue.

Hautzinger, who serves as SGA
Vice President, was also pleased
that the initiative had come from
the administration He pointed out
that if the subcommittee failed to
achieve results, the SGA would
probably take some action this
semester. '

He said students are now paying
up to 3040 percent more for
tickets than they did when SGA
handled the shuttles. He hopes
that the Spring Break shuttles will
be run by SGA.

Sckalor spoke of the many up-
coming campus events this

semester such as the big spring
waltz and Grinnell relays, He said
despite the lower budget “it will
be a big semester,"

Scharﬂ' added to this, “SGA has
a lot more potential to do good for
students than the students think it
does.”

Campus may be

overrun by ‘leillers’

by Owen Charles

starting February 14, Grinnell
College Will be experiencing a
wave of crime, adventure, and
parties, the likes of which have
not been seen in many years.

Campus celebrity David
Kopelman is in the midst of
organizing a game of “Killer", an
adventure game which was last
played in a different version at
Grinnell in 1980, According to
Kopelman. “Killer” will involve a
large number of participants.
each receiving assignment cards
with names of other players to be
"killed".

Kopelman said that he hopes to
bring about “Very, very in-
teresting and innovative parties
like nobody has ever seen before,"
via the game. He said the game
will terminate in an elaborate
awards ceremony, waltz and for
mal party about two weeks before
the end of the semester.

Organizing the game primarily
on his own, Kopelman will receive
a 5 dollar entrance fee from all
players, arrange the money into
various awards, and act as a
judge in disputes. With at least
50% of the total amount going to
awards and ten percent going to
Kopelman, any money left over
after the party will be donated to
the Committee [or Student
Politics.

According to Kopelman, the
main rules stipulate that each
player will be assigned other
players to “kill", one at a time,
and that no player shall know who
is hunting them, Those hunting
may use dart-guns, pellet-guns,
discguns, rubber knives, a bear
hug, or any other method approVs
ed by Kopelman, to eliminate
their "prey".

In addition to the 100 dollar
prize [or the winner there will also
