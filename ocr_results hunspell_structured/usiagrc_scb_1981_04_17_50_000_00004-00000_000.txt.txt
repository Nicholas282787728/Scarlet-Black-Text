SGA survey suggests future budgeting decisions

by Marilyn Clark

During the last lew days oiFebruary,
100 students at Grinnell College receiv»
ed a budget survey prepared by the
Finance Committee of the SGA These
students were chosen by matching 100
random numbers generated by a coma
puter with a numbered list oi students
presently on campus

According to Shari Rauland,
treasurer and Finance Committee
chairperson, "It more than 100 students
had been surveyed, the margin ol error
would have only minutely decreased it
would not have signiﬁcantly changed
the results enough to warrant the Ills
creased cost which would have been in»
volved in surveying more people,"

Sixty~four' students returned the
survey. Rauland stated, "These people
are Iarily representative of Grinnell In
terms 01 sex, class, area of residence
and amount of linanCial aid received.”
Rauland emphasized that "the results
at the survey are not a direct inference
about the campus but the opinions or at
students surveyed “

At the present time, the Finance
Committee is reviewing the results oi
Hie survey and will make deciSions ale
iecting next year's budget based on its
conclusions. Rauland stated,
"Everyone is invited to attend budget

.meetings where the results at the
survey will be discussed " She believes
this will allow more students to give the
committee feedback on a decision or
service which is new or will be a
Substantial change Thus, the extent to
which proposals are incorporated into
the 1981-32 budget depends, to a large
extent, on student ieedback and par
ticipation.
