Dear Ediror,

l was deeply offended by rhe arricle in rhis issue one
rirled “Dipshil Duo Wasrcs Seven Hours in mac shower.”
1 do nor for one minure believe rhar Jim l-laekeer is Mus.
lim and I found rhererernee ro islamic people beingsraire
case gnawing cross-counrry freaks insulring. I have been
Muslim my enrire life and have only gnawed on a stair»
case once afrershoweeing. ln rhe furure I requesr rhar such
smur nor be prinred in rhe 5&3.

Dear Ediror,

I would like ro rake a minure ro rhank rhe srudenr
body and rhe senarors who helped make selfegovernanee
whae ir is here ae Grinncll. ln rhe pasr semesrer, ioinr
Board has debared rhe role srudenrs should play in many
levels or rhe Grinnell hierarchy. Though rhese discus-
sions may have been long and redious ai rimes, rhey
were beneﬁcial in rhe long run as srudenrs were exercise
ing rheir righr ro be involved ar many levels ofrhe col.
lege—many more levels rhan mosr colleges allow stu»
denes. This being said, lwould like ro encourage more
people ro run for SGA senaror in rhe second semester,
Having a wider range ofviews in ioinr Board can only
lead ro berrcr represcnrarion. The sonarors rhis semesrer
have done a wonderful Job of represonring rheir con»
sriruenrs and rhe campus as a whole, bur rhere is always
room forimprovemenr.Applicarionsforsenarorareavaile
able now in rhe basemenr ofrhe Forum in rhe SGA of—
fiees. I would encourage all people ro seriously consider
running. Elecrions will be held rhe firsr Thursday afrer
break, Ger involved and see whar sruderir governmenr
does.

Self confessions of a Cowles line-cutter
The hom'ﬁc truth as told to me

By Cynthu Rogelin

5b: dorrni [mi/e libe .rprlwn @917! dead, be; below me, sbe is, 5/7: sirs across/ram m: at rbe
Harlem, and wieb each word mar/ere! by a bite iz/ber big coo/ere, myfmr and booedgzow be I
begin Mﬁtham rbe enovmiry efm‘l rbar was :lmrirlg my boar/r. Tbir ir Iver rainy.

Yes, 1’“ admir eo ir. lhave never waired in line for any meal ar Cowles Dining Hall. Bur
you have re believe me, I didn’t ser our ro be ehis way. My freshman year, I always managed
ro find a friend, or ar lease vague acquainrance, i could gee in line wirh. . . bur now _ on
God , I don’r even bother, i done even look them in rhe face anymore, rhc people i cue in
fronr of i know they’ve been wairing, and i know rhey have work and class and sruff, bur
i simply ean'r help myself. lr's like a disease. if only rhis disguseing habie oilineeeurring

were my firsr acr ofdcviance. Then maybe i could live wirh myself, (Averring her eyes, she looks wisrfully pasr me)
When I was in rhe fourrh grade, 1 was going our wirh diis adorable boy named Josiah, one nighr, during our nighrly
phone conversarion, he blurred our, ‘1 love you" and l was srunned. I didn'r know whar ro do, how ro proceed. So, in
a rush oiadrenaline I yelled, ‘I love you, too.’ And for rhe next rhree nighrs, l lied ro him again and again, eelling him
rhar i loved him, making him rhink we would be rogerher forever. Don’t you See? can'r you feel rhe parrern already
developing.> Deceprion and cruelry began for me ar such a young age. bur, leouldn'r srand rhe guilr, and evenrually, l
sar down during recess and my friends and I decided rhar I couldn’r conrinue rhis charade. i simply wasn’r ready for rhe
eommirmenr. And i broke Josiah’: hearr. (pauses, smiling iaimly) But rhis was only rhe beginning.

One day when i was in junlor high, my mom rook me ro an office supply srore, and i was resring all rhe pens.
suddenly, she announced rhar she was ready ro go, bur, as l was walking ro eheear, I looked down and realized I srill had
rhis grear piirple pen gripped righrly in my hand: The humiliarionl The exquisite eorrure ofdisillusionmene I experi.
enced in rhis discovery ofmy rrue criminal narurel Jusr like wirh Josiah, guilr consumed me, and I had ro give ehe pen
ro my besr friend, Erica. And I’ve never since been able ro wriie in purple ink. But, no, ir doesn’r end rhere . . . You see,
all my life i wanred a hamsrer or gerbil or any small rodenr i could cherish and call my own. And ar each major gifr.
exchanging holiday, I was horribly disappoinred. l remember one day in parricular when I asked my parenrs for one,
and rhey joked and laughed and said, ‘sure, we'll rhinkabour ir.’ lsoon realized all rhe rime rhey were iusr mocking my
pain. And when I pur rhe “WORST DAY" sucker on rhar day on my calender, please believe i meanr ir. Bur rhcn, ar rhe
family parry rhrown honor ofmy 16th birrhday, my sisier suddenlyannounced rhar she would buy me a hamsrer. And,
oh, rhe rapture‘. You couldn’t imagine my delighr, So, I was ﬁnally unired wirh my besr friend, who i named lchabod.
(bursiing hysrerically inro rears) Would you believe six monrhs larcr I was praying ro God rhar he would die? Oh, how
my love rurned ro harred when l realized 1 would acrually have ro clean our his disgusiing cage! Do you know how
much rhose rhings smell? Why couldn'r he iusr pick one spot? Why did he feel rhe need ro go wherever he wanredz And
I eouldn‘r ever hold him, because he would rry io escape, or pee on my hand. Oh God, forgive me, bur i wanred him is
die. This wasn'r how is was suppose ro be.

I knew be fair rhe same way. But rhe lirrle basrard wouldn'r die. Mosi hamsrers live for around six monrhs, maybe
a year ifrhey are really hardy, bur borh ofrhose milesiones pase, and srill I woke up every morning ro see his lirrle rar
face, and heard him spinning on his squeaky running cycle all high, When I lerr home ro come ro crinnell, my mom
assumed responsibiliry for his care. And when he finally died, ar rhe end ofmy ﬁrsr year, i reioicedl Oh ihe pain and
mono ofbeing such a rhoughrless pcrsonl Il's menrally exhausting, I assure you. so you can now see rhe hisrory of
berrayal and dearh ehar consumes my past, Maybe you can now begin ro undersrand rhar rhis line curring business isn’r
really my faulr. (Shaking her head) l've lied and srolen and killed, and srill rhe demon inside ofme won‘r disappear, I
simply cannor wair in line- for Cowles food. I rry, believe me. igo ro dinner, fully inrending ro wair, bur ehen, all rhe
people and rhe noise, and rhose annoying people who are always begging for signarures or canned goods . . . I cane
handle ir. so i (a slighr rwirch is developing on rhe side of her righr eye) srand by rhe chairs, prerendlng ro look
around, as ifl’m wairing. And, rhen . . . rhen , , . l seand closer ro rhe door, inching my way in, usually behind some
arhleric roam ehar has iusr come in and gone ro rhe fronr.

I Can't fully describe wirh words rhe shame 1 experience ar each meal as I cue in line. It's enough ro make me wanr
ro do somerhing rash , , ,
