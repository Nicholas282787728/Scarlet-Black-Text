The team produced better times during

“The first morning we were a little hesi-
tant to get out and race, but Friday night we
came back and swam really well,”Stimac said,
providing an overview of the invitational.
"The energy and intensity from Friday night
really carried over into Saturday morning."

“The prelimsefinals atmosphere was really
cool too. I hadn't really experienced that at a

Over break, the team will face tough
competition, including a home game on Jan
3 against Wheaton College, the number two
team in D3 basketball. “We are excited about
it," said Long, referring to the upcoming game.
“If we play like we did on [Wednesday] we
have a great chance."

January.

“[Luther] was very prepared for this last
meet," Mistry said.

The meet helped the team prepare for
their goal of winning conference again, and
so far the team’s spirits are still riding high.

“Right now, the attitude is mostly about
buckling down,”Mistty said.

Competition between the men and wom—
en's teams is solely for the purpose ofhuilding
character on the team and the team members
believe that each individual team member has
an important place on the team.

“1 think it's really different swimming
with both men and women. In my high
school. I didn't have that and it's a good way
to be pushed to become better,”said Bruce.
