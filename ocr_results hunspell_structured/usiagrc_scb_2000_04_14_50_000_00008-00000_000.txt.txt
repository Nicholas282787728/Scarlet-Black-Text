To the editor:

I appreciare Erik Cable’s re»
sponse last week so my edirorial or
the week before, in which he
poinred our how hard much orrhe
S&B :taffworks and voiced tcscnt-
menr ar a perceived demand for
more coverage of eersain groups’
“per causes." However, he misine
rerprered my lesrer, which never
menrioned any desire for more
S&B coverage of any cause, My
main problem waswirh rhe way my
earlier lesser so she ediror, abour rhe
sancrions againsr Iraq, had been
edired so rhar irs meaning was
changed. This would be a problem
no marrerwhar rhe ropic ofrhe lctr
rer. I srand by my assernon rhar
such ineidenrs or sloppy journals
ism have occurred a number of
rimes and rhas a large segmenr of
campus has lirrle fairh in rhe sous,
But I should have given more cm-
phasis ro my elosing sraremenr, rhar
”there are some people who do con»

seienrious, hard work on rhe S&B,
and ir can only ger berrer."

I also wanr so reirerare rliar
mrieh of she problem is rhar rhe
soels doesn'r ger enough financial
resources, which makes ir hard for

sourees. In addirion, I musr bewary

when ir has rnuybe been a few
people who make egregious mis.
rakes. Thanks so rhe errorss or
people like Courrney [Sherwood
Editoreln-Chicf] and I-Iiing
Wham, Arrs Editor] and oiliers l’m
nor aware of, rhe sub is raking

berrer paper,

I slighrly resenr Erik's labeling
of my lesrer as a “diatribe," and I
don’t rhink shar rhe extent of rhe
paper's coverage ofsomerhing like
the rape rally really lessens or green-
ens irs obligasion ro cover an issue
like inrernarional sanerions. Ir
rhere‘s a Ior orissuesour shere, rhey
all deserve ro seek coverage. Srill, I

don'r know who has been asking
she S&B ro give more coverage so
rheir causes, as Erik implies, bus
from my perspeerivo, I feel rhar all
I wrire aboiis lasely is aerivism, so
is gers some deeenr coverage.
rhough I was a lirrle disgrunrled as
she eomplere lack oreoverageoirhe
March sili acrion .igainsr rlie

nellians were arses-red, There's a
sun.on senrence rer your reading
pleasure.

I wonder ir rhis acrion is whar
Erik referred so as ”publicitysrunts
and inflammarory Ihcloric.” Ir
sounds like he has some orher is.
sues wirh aenvism rliar his Ierrer
doesn't direerly address, so I don's
know how ro respond so them.

Anyway I'll iusr poinr our, r—
nally, rhar my lesser aboiir Iraq was

ormany so-ealled “strident acrivisr
groups” would supporr ir,

To the Editor::

I am wriring regarding Erik Gablc‘s lesser ro she
ediror in lastweck'sS&B, in which he lambasred Mali
Lorenz for lambasring rhe S&B ros printing her Ierrer
in a way one misrepresenred her inrenrions. Mr, Gable
complained rhar Ms, Lorenz insuIred she paper's sraff
ror nor pussin enough riine into rheir work, and dias
Grinnell aeri sr groups are misusing rhe S&B as a
“soapbox" ror rheir “per causes," when she paper should
devore more space ro Ioeal issues, Iwould like ro rec
spond ro Mr. Cable‘s lerrer on rwo fronrs

First, I think the question is not whether (lie S&B
should devore more space ro local news or interna»
rional polirical issues, burwherher rhe paper will fuss
res rhoughrrul discourse or nor. The aim ofa good
publicasion, in my opinion, is drive irs readers so ques-
rion rhemselves, and rhen ro ass, regarding wharever
issues rhey deem mosr relevanr, An issue’s relevance,
clearly. is nor a runesion ofirs geography, and few shings
could be worse rhan a paper rhar buiIs walls around irs
readers, imprisoning rhem in she naine of“:igniliczlncc
ro rhe Grinnell College cominuniry." Neverrheless, ir
a campus group has broughs up an issue so ofren or
wirh so lirrle innovasion rhar some ofirs publie begins
so rise or is and ignore ir, rhis is clearly a sign rhar
somerhing new muss be done ro renew rhe public’s
interest, either In the same calls: or In a new one. It is

rhe paper's responsibilisy ro help groups in doing rhis.
eirher by presenring rheir issue in a new way, or by
finding a new issue ro compel rhe readership ro shink
and acr. ‘ ’

This brings me so my seeond from. I eannor say
preciselywhar Ms. Lorenz inresided, bur Iean say whar,
as a reader ofher Ierrer, I undersrood. I hope rhar
orher readers inserprered is rhe same way I did. The
problem wirh she ssebs edirorial clipping, I under.
srood, was nor rhar rhe edirors decided ro devore more
space ro issues orher rhan rhar oils/Is. Lorenz, bur rhar
rhey eur a erueiaI pair orher Ierrer, which significanrly
alrered irs apparenr meaning. Ifrhe paper aspires ro
beeomean organ oishoughrful soeial discourse, ircan.
nor do so by presennng ineorreerly she views of us
eonrriburors. As regards she sous sraffbeing “uncomv
inirred," l iindeissood rhar die problem was nor rhar die
wrireis spend ron much am on rlieir class work insread of
dicirarticles, bur diar producing a paper is roo gear a rask

Greerings, ya'll's.

Jusr now, Iwas surﬁng she col-
lege web sire. srying ro find our
what's happening on campus So
I wear srraighr so she 5w, rhar
rrusry souree or informarion
abour rhe campus, There, I en.
eounrered an asricle by Mr.
Rush. hild, concerning she Cur—
rent SGA body. His article ins
spired me so pur forward myown
ideas concerning rhe SGA

I roo believe rhar SGA is an
inefrieienr. anriouared body
whose rime has come so an end
I—Iaving sar in debares all rhrougli
lass seinesser, debares which
would conrinue for hours with-
our achieving a dcclsion, I have
some up wirh a new idea,

I_er us, rhe Grinnell College
srudenr body, be rhe ﬁrst on a
radical wave rhas will sweep over
colleges rhroughour rlie Unired
siares. I propose rhar we coin.
plesely abolish SGA (borh senase
and Cabiner), and replace is with
a sysrem berrer suired ro Grinnell:
A fascisr. rosalirarian srare ruled
by one srrong leader (prererably
myself), who would be rhe head
of“Thc parry".

You are probably wondering,
just whar rhis would accomplish.
For srarrers, is would remove rhas
pesky problem of eIeesions. lns
sread of a whole slug or candi-
dares and runoff eleerions, rhere
would be only one eandidare and
one eleerion

If rhe candidare does nor win
in she ﬁrsr round, rhen a sysreme
aric purge orThe I>arry would oc-
cur, eonsinuing unril she candidare
is vosed inro power. (I am nor pro»
posing rhe esrablishrnenr or a 5:-
ries of Gulags and/or concenssa—
rion eamps across rhe eosnfieIds of
Iowa, ,usr rhe reassignmenr of

purged Party members ro sueh po-
sirions as manual laborer ar
CERA.)

This new governmens would
open up rhe eiirrenr “cabiner
clique", and bring new ideas and
beliefs iiiro rhe sysrem, much as
whar happened in post-1917 Rus»
sia. This infusion ofnew blood and
beliefs would shake up she eurrenr
ruling elire. and would give Grins
neII siiidenrs, for rhe ﬁrst nnie in
rheir lives, a direer role in rhe ope
erarion orgovernmenr.

Whole ininisrries would be cs<
rablishcd for she purpose ofcxplorz
ing new issues, erearing massive
doeumenrs ihar would be eireiie
Iared and signed by everyone, bur
would acrually say norhing (big
change here). Fllrthcrmorc, iinpan
rial and unbiased minisrries would
rake over rhe rasks rhar marrer mosr
ro crinnellians, i.e., funding pars
ries and rnps everywhere, relieving
rhe srudenr body of rhe need so
shink for rhemselves.

During rhe rransirion from rhe
currenr SGA sysrem ro my pro-
posed sysrem, rhere will be rimes
orrroubles and pain. But is will be
only remporary, I assure you.
Withln a shorr period ofrime, we
will have an esrablished body of
people whose sole purpose (aside
from srudying) will be ro make life
easier for Grinnell srudenrs. we
will finally have comperenr leader—
ship, capable orguiding ourschool
rhrough the upcoming rimes of
rsoubles.

Bast orall. rhis plan can be
implemenred in only a rew shorr
hours, iiisr long enough ro srorm
rlie Forum and Burling, pausing
only so desrroy all son ﬁles and
re esrablish diploinasie relarions
wirh rhe Presidenr Osgood.
