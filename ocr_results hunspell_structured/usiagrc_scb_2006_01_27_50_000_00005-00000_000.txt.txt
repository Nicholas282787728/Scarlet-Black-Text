Omaha: ‘Youth and
the Justice System'

By LIZ CARRIER

I learned from Alt Breakirhis may sound
cheesyihow much fun I could have while volunteer-
ing. I’ve volunteered before for places like Habit for
Humanity and Planned Parenthood, and those were
all fulfilling experiences because I felt like I was helps
ing a cause I really believed in.

This time, besides feeling like I vets doing some-
thing positive, 1 actually had a lot or tutti spent a
lot of my week playing soccer, basketball and root
ball with very enthusiastic kids. What’s not to love?
I could spend all day attempting to beat 15-year-old
boys in n one-onzone game ofbaskctball.

When I ﬁrst applied to Alr Break, this trip was
advertised to me as “The Justice System — A Genera—
tional Approach” or something like that. We were go-
ing to do some Work in prisons, but also with people
who were at risk for ending up in the penal system.

I was prepared for a pretty heavy volunteer experi~
ence. But, because of red tape within the Nebraska
penal system and other problems, we didn't actually
end up doing any volunteering in the prison system.

The majority of our volunteering time was spent
working with at-risk kids at the four different Boys
and Girls Clubs around Omaha.

We also helped out one day with an aftetsschool
academicenrichmenrprogram called Pacesetter Acadr
emy, took a tour ofajaii in Omaha, went to meetings
for a group called Stand Up for Children nnd went to
Civil and Criminal Court to learn about Protection
From Abuse orders and how the court proceedings
for those work.

But most of our time we just played with the kids.
I liked that we got to go to all four clubs in the Omaha
area, as each one had a completely different feel to it,
such as how crowded the club was—or wasn’t~what
sports the kids wanted to play, how much freedom the
kids had and each neighborhood itself.

Grinnell: ‘We
[Heart] the Elderlyf

Bv ALLISON ROSENTHAL

our Alternative Break trip exernplihcd the word
“alternative." Instead of traveling to an exotic locitle
with eithei a metropolis or warm weather, we stayed
in Giinnell and served an often overlooked sector of
the population—the elderly,

Though our trip activities included everything
from volunteering at Second Mile to playing bingo,
our two major objectives were to help plan the Mays
ﬂower Home's winter carnival and to compile a book
of oral histories from both the seniors at the May
ﬂower Home and in the Glinnell community. Tran»
scribing the oral histories consumed more of our time,
but was also our greatest success,

Our biggest obstacle was fitting in enough time
for interviews due to such a high level of interest. The
seniors shared their stories about their families, work
ing on farms, World War II and living in Grinnell.
One senioi talked about celebrating Chiistmas with
Elnesr Hemingway while stationed in Key West, Fla.
during World Writ II.

Some revealed the way of life in rural Iowa; one
resident of the Mayﬂower Home worked as 1| teacher
in a one-room school house in New Sharon, Iowa.
and talked about how she needed to keep her elopes
merit a secret to avoid being fired for being n married
woman.

All ofthc participants histories gave us a sense of
the culture and lifestyle oflowrl.

This Alternative Bieak tiip also enabled me to
leave the Grinnell College bubble and IntCl‘ACI with
and really bccomc t part ofthc Grinncll community
We intended the Democratic guberniitoriitl caucus
that was held on Martin Luther King Day.

The town welcomed our political participation
and offered us the opportunity to be part of the count
ty committees to plan the Iowii Democratic Party's
platform and to attend the convention.
