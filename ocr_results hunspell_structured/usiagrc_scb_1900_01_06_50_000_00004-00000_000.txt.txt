The Modern Jew.

The lecture given in the chapel
last evening by Mr. sam‘i Stlilus‘S,
oi Des Moines, on the subject,
”'l‘llc Modern Jew." was listened
to by a large and appreciative au-
dieiice. it is interesting to hear
about the Jews tiom the stand
point or a Jew, and the speaker
treated the subject in a digniﬁed
and instructive manner.

Mr. Strauss said in part: For
3,000 years the Jewish people
have been living on the earth and
have prospered, and yet they
stand to-day an interrogation
point among all nations. Being
misundeistood is what has torture
ed the Jew tor centuries. The
Jew isa riddle. It is as true of
the individual as ot the people.
Even their religion, though it has
stood inviolate through all the
ages of changing thought,
been surrounded by mystery.
regard to the three religions
it has been said that the
Greeks worshiped the goodness
oi beauty, the Jews the beauty of
goodness, and the Christians the
goodness of love. The Jews oi
today are divided into three
classes. First, the Reformedchs.
who represent the broadest, most
advanced thought of somewhat
aristocratic tendencies. Second,
a large class ot toilers who take
pleasure not accumulating
wealth. but in making money.
Though often misunderstood, they
are not altogether to be deicnded.
The third class are the immigrants
from Russia and France, bowed
down under oppression and per»
secution.

There are eight million Jews
among six hundred million Chriss
tians and Moslems. Whatever
might have been true of toriner
ages, the religious differences do
not now account for the prejus

-diee against the Jew.

 

The hatred
of the Jew is engendered by the
large place the Jew occupies in
proportion to their numbers. The
Jews of Germany are but tliiee-
fourths at one per cent. of the
whole population, untl have been
accorded ClVIl iiglils but thirty
years, yet eighty per cent. of the
successful lawyeis of Berlin, and
and seventy percent. at the Ger
man pioressors. are chs.

The Jew is superior in intellect.
He has taken the most prominent
places in the trades, arts and pros
fessions. The Anti-Scihitist des
clares that it they are to be in the
race, the Jew must be llandis
capped. The speakertlten closed
with a glowuig tiibute to the fu-
ture ot Judaism.

We are glad to see that Coinell
is acting the good Samaritan, in
playing iootbail wiili Drake, when
bullies(?7 like S. U. 1., Antes and
Grilluell abuse her. How much
do you get out of it, anyhow, Cor-

Illinois is to have a new college
of agriculture built on the grounds
of the University of Illinois, be-
tween Cliaiiipaign and Urbana.

There will be four large build~
lugs built on the four sides of an
open court. The main building
is to be devoted to ofﬁces, labor-
atories, lecture rooms, auditorium.
