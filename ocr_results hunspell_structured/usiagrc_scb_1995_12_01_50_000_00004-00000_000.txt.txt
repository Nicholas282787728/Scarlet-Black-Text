Ace Ventura 2 When Nature
Calls is bettetthon it‘spieenisot, hut
that‘s not saying much considering
that it’s practically the same flick
withsditteientsetting. Venium gets
ﬂown to Africa on a special mission:
to recover the sacred white hat, She
ishicaca (we're not making this up),
a rodent with wtngs. a glimmer in its
eyes that says “satan wuz here" and
teeth large enough to eat an entire
giraffe. Jenny thought the bat was
cute. Shishicaka’s purpose as a wed
ding dowry is to prevent inter—tribal
war, and to give Kate the creeps.
While attempting to avert war, Ven—
tura engages in the usual assortment
of butt and bodily function jokes,
and his trademark antics and impel»
sonations.

Afunny thing happened on the
Way to the movie; we were in the car,
and suddenly it turned into a hippo—
potamus, and it reminded us of this
part in the movie where Ace is spy<
ingon these government people who
are making some transaction, and
he‘s inside this plastic rhinoceros,
and it’s really hot in there, and he
takes off all his clothes, Well, the
eoot thing is the doot gets stuck, and
the only way out for hitn is through
its hutt. The thing is, they'te in this
national petk type place, and these
tourists are making this big deal out
ofthe rhino (they think it‘s real), and
Aee is in the midttte or ttying to
break free from it. So, they think it’s
havtng a baby. and start to scream
and vomit when a naked and very
sweat— soaked Ace pops out. The
cops had asimilar reaction to us, but
we managed to get to the movie
anyway.

Any rhirteen—yearold boy, nine—
year old gitt oi drunken Gtinnett
student would find this movie hilar-
ious. However, ifyou don’t fit into
one of those categories... you would
have to be in quite a strange mood to
sippteeiute this screwball comedy
Even after having been birthed by a
hippo, we’re not sure our mood was
strange enough.

Maybe eyetyoneshould have the
AceVentui-dexperienceatleastonce.
but we think that twice may be ex»
Cesslve.

Counterpoint (Taylor) Hey
good flick. A bunch ofkids searchtn'
for booty (choose your own mean—
ing), and gtovm' to Cindy Lauper, ya
just can’t beat it. My personal fave
was Dam oteoutse, who by the way
went on to have a very successful
career on Star Trek the Next Gener<
ation. Go in defiance of the work we
all must do.

Stephen King has had a long
and not too glamorous history of his
books being reinterpreted in the cin»
ematic fashion. Some of his most
senous etitusttophes have been The
Mangler, The Graveyard Shift, and
Maximum OVCIdHVS. Ofcouise. we
can not forget his few and far be»
tween successes; It, Stand By Me,
and Misery. Of course, when you
