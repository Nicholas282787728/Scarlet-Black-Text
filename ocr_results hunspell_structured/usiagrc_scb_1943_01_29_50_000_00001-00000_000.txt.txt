January Grads’
Friars Pins to
Stay on Campus

Friars will elect a new president
to replace Louis Schuler, graduat—
ing senior, early next week, ac-
cording to Douglas strong, secre—
tary, sole remaining officer of the
organization.

Because new members were tap-
pcd last fall, present vacanies will
not be filled until late this spring,
Strong said.

He also emphasized that stan—
dards for entrance have not, and
will not be lowered.

A coup d'etai. inspired by retir—
ing president Schuler and member
Charles Glaman to retain their
nl'iginal Friars pins failed when
the tradi onal practice of present—
ing spacial key pins to graduates
was retained, Strong said.

The Friars pins now being Worn
by members have never left the
campus, but have been given to

each succeeding group, Strong
said.

the contrary notwithstanding, stu—
dents of Grime]! should be able
to hold their own very nicely on
matters constitutional and his-
ton-ital, at least as far as their
own country is concerned.

Moreover, the gentlemen of the
campus should shins oven more
brightly on this score than the
ladies—«wen though the Lord and
F. 1. loves ’em. ..

Crinnell college has an excel<
lent record in the study of Ann
crican history and government
compared to that of the larger
universities and colleges in the
nation, a survey completed under
the direction of Dean Shelton L.
Beatty has revealed.

The survey, made by Jack
Frye, was inspired by an article

Plan Dropped

No Skai'ing Rink
Says Gibbs

All plans for the proposed
ice-rink have been abandoned
by the freshmen class, presi-
dent James Gibbs‘, Read, an-
nounced last night.

Technical difficulties in
flooding the proposed site of

the rink were given as the
reason for failure.

Money collected from stu—
dents to finance the project

entitled “Compulsory Study of
American HistoryiAn Apprais-
al". The author, Joseph R. stray-
er, discovered through a New
York Times questionnaire in June,
1942, that most colleges do not
require American history for em
trance or for graduation, and that
most undergraduates never take
a course in American history.

During the academic year,
194142, only nine per cent
of the students enrolled in
American colleges or unl-
versities were taking “Any
ericon courses."

Best records in the colleges
surveyed by strayer were those
of Princeton and Dartmouth, in
which 97 and 83 per cent of the
students respectively had stud-
ied American history in either
college or preparatory schools.

Alfred Nickless.

lowa Churchman,
Speaks Thursday

Alfred S. Nickless, minister of
the First Presbyterian church in
Davenport, will speak in chapel
Thursday morning on “Victorious
Life.”

Nickless, who was born in Eng—
land, hes received degrees from
the Presbyterian Theological sem»
incry in Chicago, and Coe college
in Cedar Rapids. '

Before securing his present per
sition in Davenport in 1935. he
was pastor of the Albany Park
Presbyterian and the Fourth
Presbyterian churches of Chicago,
the First church of San Francisco,
and the Presbyterian church of
the Covenant in Detroit.

He is prcsident of the Daven—
port Ministerial association for
1943.

The Grinnell record is 51 per
cent for college courses clone,
preparatory courses not having
been considered.

Broken down, the tabula-
tion shows a seven per cent
majority of men over wom-
en, the {gums being 54: and
41 per cent respectively.
Courses included in the defi—

nition were American govern-

ment, history and social studies.

Grinnell‘ still does not require any

of these for entrance or gradua»

tion, unless to satisfy major re—
quirements.

As of December, 1942, 254 stu-
dents were enrolled or had taken
at least one of these courses. So-
phomores led the participation
with 113 students, followed by
seniors, 60; juniors 51; and
freshmen, 25 (college work, not
high school), Beatty said.

NursesAide Class
Will Be Cancelled

The nurses ide course will not
be given this year, Miss Evelyn
Gardner, dean of women, an-
nounced today. The Red Cross
nurses aide committee of Grinnell
made this decision when it was
found there would not be time to
finish a complete training period
during the remainder of the col-
lege year. ,

The prerequisite for nurses side,
is a first aid certificate. Only
four of the fourteen girls signed
for the nurses side have taken
the first aid course. The other
ten are urged to enroll in that
course now, in order to be ready
for training in September, Miss
Gardner said.

No Specific Dorm
Chosen as Ye+ by
Adminis‘l'ra’rion

One men‘s hall will definitely
be closed as a result of the
drop in enrollment following
mid-year graduation, Dean
Shelton L. Beatty announced
yesterday. .

Definite action has not yet
been taken, however, pending
word from the army and
navy in regards to reservists
failing to make the required
1.5 grade average.

College officials will decide
which house will be closed, but
the C. of H. P. will direct any
changes in hall personnel or or-
ganizoiton.

Bectty explained that the col-
lege has authority on the changes
affecting its physical plant, but
that the students representatives
will be responsible for the assimi.
lation of men. singly or in hall
groups among the other halls.

Dr. Samuel N. Stevens said yes-
t/orday that loss of men during
the first semester has been utoo
scattered to mark any single hall‘
as the obvious one to close."

Although the present men's
dormitory system was filled at
the beginning of the school year,
about 25 men dropped out during
the semester. This, and the fact
that 17 men graduated last week,
has left several halls only par-
tially filled, Bestty said.

In addition, 10 naval reservists
and 17 members of the army re-
serve failed to make a grade
point average last semester suf—
ficiently high to meet service re-
quirements and no change will be
made in housing systems until
service officials decide whether
these men shall be called for im-
mediate active service.
