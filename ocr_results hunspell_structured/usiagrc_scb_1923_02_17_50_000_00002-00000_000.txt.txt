EDISON'S CRITICISM.

Thomas A. Edison, in an interview
granted some time ago to the Daily
Princetonian, expressed his opinion of
colleges and college men in no uncer-
tain terms, While admitting that col-
leges are fine for men who want to
work, he said that very few men of
this type went to college. "The ninin
' objection that 1 have against a college
graduate," he said, “is that he objects
to work. especially if it is dirty. He
does not want a iob'wlth much work
to it, and when he does get a posi—
tion, he expects to he made foreman
at the end of the sixth week. The
college graduates that l have wor 'ng
for me usually show lack of imaging»
tion. . . . The average college man's
knowledge of his surroundings and en—
vironment is usually inadequate. What
young men need is a broad general
understanding of every little thing in
life, such as would ﬁt them to be able
to answer my questionnaire."

As an inventor, Edison is supreme
‘in his own ﬁeld, As an economist or
commentator on American colleges, he
The scientific
genius should connne himself to his
own ﬁeld. We can remember. a 'year
or so ago, when Edison had a plan
for doing away with the inflation of
American currency and a few other
things by the construction of some
inlmtlise irrigation project somewhere
in West Virginia or North Carolinav
it makes no difference. By some means
or other he ﬁgured that the prosperity
of the people resulting from the Dru—
ject would enable them to remodel
their economic system. We are unable
to remember much about it except that

the llleil was ridiculous in the eyes of
cconolnists.

Only a few days ago, on the occztsioll
of his eighty ixlll hi hday, Ethson
lnugticd oil the Ruhr situation in an
intemcu gi-nntod some reporters. sny
mg that it was just a littlc visit ol
the French tutu Gel-innit tcr tory and
didn't amount to much. According to
the best reports available the situation
grows more serious every day. and
the British are contemplating with-
troops from continental

judgment

drawing thci

soil. Again Edison‘s is
wrong.
The whitc—hdi d genius is in no po-
siiion to criticise Aiucricnl colleges
and college men. His only contact
with college men is in his own cstztlie

lislimel‘it, where he knows but a. few‘
out oi the mluly hundreds and [hour
sands glddimlell each year. He SCI-
tlolll ventures outside (It his own lith-
oratory. and therefore hits little or no

There is, admittedly, some truth in
Ellison's statement, liuL should he can-
damn colleges and college men its it
whole? He should not. college men
are only human, and subject to the‘

same foibles and weaknesses as others.

If some of them incl: imagination,
those may be the ones whom Edison
has working for him. The inventor
should remember that scientiﬁc train—
ing frequently kills or dulls imaginar

tion. ‘

Each of us knowsvhow to do one
thing .better than any other, or at
least ought to. The more specialized
we bccome, as a rule. the narluwer
our outlook becomes. it is well, then,
for the genius to conﬁne himself to
comments and criticisms on topics
about which he knows something, and
leave other subjects to those who are
better equipped to c 'ticisc.

There are two methods. The ﬁrst

is to make chapel attendance compuls

The other is one which has been
talked of a great deal but has never-
been tried. That is to announce thel
chapel speakers on Saturday. [or in'

one objection to the plan is that the
students would not go to hear the
sDenkers whom they did not like. This
is a logical objection as far as it goesl
but we don't. believe that there are‘
my many members. of the faculty
whom the students would not go to‘
hear. One of the reasons why many
students loiter in A. R. H. instead of‘
going to chapel is that they are afraid
one of the unpopular speakers is go—
ing to talk, while in four cases out ot‘

Jnnc Austin's Juvenailn.

Writing is a great deal like flirting,
you know If you dont‘ know how to
do it, nobody can tell you how; and
if yuu‘do know, no one can keep you
from it

Jane Austin was writing "novels” and
“histories” before she could spell with
any degree of accuracy, We cannot say
for certain at what age she drank her
first bottle of ink—but it must have
been shortly before LOVE AND
FRIENDSHIP (stokes) was written.
The book is a neat little collection of
her juvenile works, supposed to have
been set down when she was seven—
teen. These unﬁnished novels are in
letter form, and will probably be dull
stuff to students taking English Novel
courses. But if you can see the hur-
lesque that is intendediit will be a
thing rare and undennable.

of the situation will be lost on the
gentle reader. Gilbert K. Chesterton

book, in which he almost ruins the cf»;
feet of said book by turning it into
something to he studied.
