Goal reached early
Dorms, Rosenfield Program proﬁt

Grinnell College's campaign ior $18
million in new iunds has reached its goals
two years ahead oi schedule, .

Announcing the oiiicial close of the cams
paign this week, President George Drake
said that as oi June 30 the iunddrive stood
at $19,137,000 in tow] gifts and pledges.

Begun in ms as a projected fiveryear eta
iort, the campaign drew support irom the
college's trustees, alumni, faculty and staii,
parents, students, area residents and
businesses. ioundations and others,

Citing the institution's 37-men1ber board
as "nationally exemplary in its special com-
mitment to maintaining Grinnell as a high-

o‘uality college," Drake said the trustees
personal giits accounted ior almost hali oi
the total raised in the campaign.

Drake said that the largest project made
possible by the new iunds is the complete
renovation of most of the college's residence
halls at a total cost of some $7 million.

Built as Oxiord-style structures over a
15-year period before 1920, the residences
accommodate the majority oi the college's
l.240 students.

The hall renovation includes complete
rewiring, new heating and plumbing,
replacement of wood sash with double glaz-
ed aluminum windows, lining all external

walls and roofs with new insulation,
carpeting of corridors and lounges, new
resilient ﬂooring in student rooms and all
new ceramic tile bathrooms,

Drake said that in those halls where work
has been completed there has been a
“dramatic" decrease in energy consump-
tion as a result of the renovation.

“The halls being central to the life of a
residential college like Grinnell, we are
most grateful tor the campaign iunds that
have made possible this major upgrading oi
students' living quarters,” Drake sai .

The new iunds are also benefit ing a
number oi curricular and special programs,
notably the Roseniield Program in Public
Affairs, International Relations and Human
Rights

The program, which was started last year
with the appearance of former U N. Am-
bassador Andrew Young, provides ior

Mellon grants money for humanities
“Exciting opportunity for faculty”

by Anne Rawiand

Grinnell's tradition of excellence Once
again proved iinancially iruitiul.when the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation announced
its $275,000 award to the college tor the
development oi the humanities,

The grant, which is offered to a limited
number oi private liberal arts colleges. is
designed ior longrrange use. it also requires
institutions to expend the monies during the
19805.

Grinnell competed with other institutions
of the "Princeton/Yale" caliber for the
grant, according to Dean oi the Faculty
Catherine Frazer. Besides Grinnell, the
Mellon Foundation awarded one other in
stitutlon. Middlebury College, 3350.000
under the same program.

in distributing the iunds Frazer proposes
to define the humanities in a broad sense in
order to include the history, philosophy and
religious studies departments Normally.
Grinnell clasSilies these departments under
other divisions as a “political" rather than
technical distinction. said Frazer,

The Foundation invited President Drake
to apply during the 1931 spring semester and
the initial proposal was submitted in April.
The college was notiiied oi the award in
mid-July, To comply with Mellon guidelines
the college must invest the monies and use
both the principle and the interest.

Frazer said the award will directly affect
55 laculty members and 12 departments
However. she added, "Obviously, it you
don’t have to use operating iunds llor those
departmentsl you can reallocate," Thus.
Grinnell's remaining 55 faculty members
and 10 departments also stand to gain.

No plans presently exist ior speciiic
allocation of the funds but the Foundation
set out general guidelines irom which Grins
nell's administration drew up iour areas oi
concentration, These tour project areas in-
clude direct iaculty development, cur—
riculum development, "Mellon
Fellowships" and early replacement apr
pointments.

“In order to receive input irom the laculr
ty. the award now goes to the Executive
Council to iron out the details in the coming
weeks," said Frazer The Executive Council
consists oi the division heads, two faculty
members, Faculty Chair Morris Parslow,
Frazer, Executive VicerPi-esident Waldo
Walker and President George Drake,

Under the direct lacuity development porn
tion of the outline the administration pro-
poses holding seminars to teach proiessors
skills which will "assist learning." suid
Frazer. "Those skills tall under the general
headings oi computers, quantitative
analysis and communication.

“Few or us have training in how you teach
students to be eiiective speakers," noted
Frazer. She proposes to hold the seminars in
the summer over the next three to {our
years, oiiering a stipend to participants. "1
don't really care if an individual learns
everything about computers," she said,
"But I'd like him to be as familiar with
them as an incoming freshman,"

The part oi the iunding earmarked ior
curriculum development will also concen-
trate on the aiorementioned skills. Frazer
plans to use this portion to give release time

to proiessors while providing replacements
so the college “won't have to give up a
course" during the proiessors absence.

The third project area, the Mellon
Fellowships, will be allocated ior promoting
iaculty members earlier than has been
possible with existing iunds, The proposal
calls ior promoting two members concur
rently every two to three years

The last project will also receive the
largest portion oi the iunding because, ac
cording to Frazer, it is also the most expenr
sive, This project calls ior anticipating
iaculty retirements by appointing
replacements early. Presently a depart
ment can find itself defic‘ient in both courses
and proiessors because it must wait until a
iaculty member actually announces retire
ment before looking for a replacement

The college also plans to oiier more
beneiits to early retirees. Although mans
datory retirement now stands at age as, it
will rise to 70 in July, 1932, Thus, a professor
would not be penalized ior retiring early.
Frazer noted the college already oiiers para
tial retirement payments but the grant will
“cnchance” the current amount

When asked how the grant will affect the
balance between diviSIOns Frazer said, "Of
course It Will most immediately affect the
humanities but we‘re small enough so that
it‘ll directly aiiecl the other departments "

"It looks like a really exciting opportunity
for the laculty," said Humanities Chair Sana
dy Moffett, "It's hard to find something not
positive about it,"

Burling renovation nearly realized

If plans approved work could begin in November

by Steven W. Way

Grants in excess of $600,000 were awarded
this summer to the college tor the Burling
Library renovation project, bringing to
$1,960,000 the funds raised thus far and
clearing the way for final review and ex
pected approval by the Board or Trustees at
its October meeting.

Though $700,000 oi the projected 52 7
million budget must still be raised, EXr
ecutive Vice~President Waldo Walker said
that with the bulk oi the money in hand he
assumed the board would approve the plans,
This means actual construction on the two
story addition could start in late November.

”Everything hinges on the trustees' ap-
proval," Walker said, "My assumption is
that with this amount or money we will go
ahead with the project. and, like in poker.
you bet a little on the come."

“If the Board of Trustees gives its go
ahead, I suspect we would start by' the end oi
November or maybe in December," he said.
”HOW much construction we might get done
during the winter months depends on the
weather “

The $600,000 in private money that was
awarded the renovation drive over the sum-
mer came irom the Kresge Foundation,
which gave $300,000, , the. Pew Memorial

Trust, which donated $250,000 and the
Kinneerindstrom Foundation, with $50,000.
Another grant was received last year irom
the Booth-Ferris Foundation and amounted
to $100,000.

The largest single financial pledge has
come from the college's own trustees who
volunteered 31 million. The remaining
$260,000 is being funded by a grant from the
National Endowment for the Humanities
that was approved prior to the Reagan Ad-
ministration‘s cuts in that agency's budget,

Walker is hoping that the additional
$700,000 can be accumulated from alumni
donations and expanded contacts in Iowa,

The architectural iirm oi Weese, Seepey,
Hickey and Weese has been working closely
with the Loomis construction firm in a uni
que arrangement that insures input from
both companies on every level oi design

it the plans are approved in their present
form, Loomis Will construct the twostory
“penthouse" that will provide 10,000 addr
tional square ieel oi iloor space and room
tor up to 250.000 volumes, an addition likely
to keep the library up to date ior the next 25
years

The issue of whether books Will be the
primary sources ior research in the iuture

has been a controversial topic during past
Board of Trustees meetings. But President
George Drake said improvements in the
study atmosphere oi the library will be
worth the money spent even ii books no
longer serve their present vital purpose,

“There was a good deal oi disagreement
about the future of books in the trustee
meetings." Drake said. “We had some very
lively and interesting debates about
whether books will be obsolete within the
next 25 years — they didn't let us oii easy.

“But so much oi the money spent is going
into changing the ambiance of the library,
that even if we don't end up With 500,000
books we won't have wasted our money," he
said.

Drake said internal library changes will
most likely not take place until the summer
of 1982 in order to disrupt use of Burling as
little as possible but a degree of inconve»
nience is inevitable.

“We've made it clear to the contractor
that we cannot vacate the library, so that's
going to be a tricky problem," Drake said
“There's no doubt that the renovation will
be an inconvenience to students, so the ques
lion is how much of an inconvenience, We
know that there will be no noise at night "

Drake said that, though the current Cams
paign is over, “the work in this area is never
iinished, particularly in view oi the continu-
ing ravages oi inilation and their eiiect on
the entire higher education community.

“Grinnell is fortunate to have a develop»
