singles. Macy also played a remark-
able helding game saving several er—

largest contributor to the error col-

Grlunell‘s ﬁrst three were retired
in rapid succession but Ames started
scoring immediately. Kerrigan, who
headed their batting list, interposed
his anatomy between one ot Ficken's
shoots and Keniston‘s glove, and re
