A modest proposal for innovative Iowa cuisine

My head is still aching tiom last satuiday. To-
day, six days later, you shouldn‘t expect a lorlgrwinded
exposition about how nature/politics are still neither
strong nei interesting,'rcspcctivelu Alcohol is, upon
reﬂection, some seriously vile and nasty crap that any
sane person should take a
sip of 1nd think What

into my system?" I’m ap-
parently trot that sane, so
I’m working off the gene
eral remedy that ‘liliscry

being the ease, I need to fill my stomach with some
equally horrible crap that even a starving dog worrld
ttrrn down.

Which is why it s a good thing Ive got Easy Mac.

Kratt is looking at its quarterly report, and one otthe

huge, and it’s coming this way,” says a third executive,
grimly.

This stands in stark contrast to

things like fried bananas and fried tofu which, surr

thinner than the plot for a Dane Cook movie.

It may be because Americans are pretty notori-
ous ror not liking to walk. I’ve seen people pull over
onto the side ofa culb, dash into one store, then come
out, jump back into their car and drive about no tcet
down the stleet to the next store. But that can’t be the
reason why Americans are so damn tat. I'd estimate
that, at any given time, 94 percent orail the people in
Jakaita arc in a car or on a motorcycle, Not because
they drive a lot but because the traffiejams there lit—
crally make it acceptable to be several hours late (or
work (especially ifits iaining, which in Jakaita is all
the time) Hell, Jakarta doesnt even have sidewalks!

l think the reason behind Indonesl inherent
slendcrness is that Indonesians smoke at a rate that
makes chimneys reel inadequate. several of my Ins

part traffic exhaust, but mostly the
noxious releases of nine million
pairs of lungs. Unfortunately for
American blobs, smoking is not a

smoking is condemned on the same level as practici

side Cyclone Alley, tornados are ex-
0th. In the words ofa humorous little
pamphlet available in the SGA omccs,
“OMG,TORNADOS!" And after last
week's close call, it is clear that Grins
ncll's current tornado response proce—
dures do not adequately serve a (largely
clueless) student body situated smack
in the middle of tornado territory. We
expect that security has reached this
same conclusion

Tardy preparation should not be ten
peated next academic yeat.The booklets
that ﬁnally reached students this week
ought to have been distributed at the
beginning of term, Further, booklets
should not only be available to students
living in dorms—ort-campus students
are equally vulnerable.

And, although Steve Btiseoc‘s sthr
ccssive c-miiil were humorous in their

students. Then,
RLCs could
supplement the emergency booklets
with tornado awareness study breaks.

Certainly, the avenues for commu-
nication about tornado warnings need
to expand. Although many students
either heard the tornado sirens or had
internet access to receive ermail alerts,
other students on campus spent last
week's tornado unaware of the extreme
weather. Interior looms in the JRC and
Noyce, for example, cannot hear the si—
iens. But these are also easily reachable
with the building's PA system Tornado
response procedures shouldn't ignore
the mechanisms that already exist on
campus Incorporate them into a betr

otherwise be at risk.

Doors barred to some

Criticizing the operation of the Joe
Rosenﬁcld '25 Center is practically an
intramural sport, But as students have
become used to the quirks of the JRC,
complaints have slowly subsided. Still,
since the building is quickly becoming
the center of campus life, it is lmpor
tant to ensure that serious problems are
addressed by the administration iii a
timely manner.

Three weeks ago the Steel; cone
tacrcd Michael Simms, senior associate
dean for student Life, in preparation
for a staffeditorial concerning frequent

trivial, but considering that the doors in
question are one of only three handi»
capped-accessible doors to the JRC,
it raises much bigger questions about
how welcoming we are as a campus.

After the significant strides made
last year in making the campus more
accessible and raising awareness about
the importance of being open, it is un-
acceptable tor such simple corrective
measures to be continually ignored. It
reﬂects poorly on our campus to pl‘oV
schlive students, their parents, other
visitors, students, staft and faculty who
need aecLss to the building but may
have challenged mobility. By keeping
the doors locked, the administration
is sending only one message, “persons
with wheelchairs, walkers, canes or
crutches are not welcome iir out came
pus center."
