The economic role of immigrants

By Heather Leith

The Rosenfield Program Sym-
posium, f‘Closing the Golden Door to
the Immigrant," concluded last Friday
with lectures by Roger Conner, director
of the Federation for American Im-
migration Reform iFAlR), and James
Fallows, Washington editor of Atlantic
Monthly.

During the panel discussion iollowing
the lectures, Fallows pinpointed the dit-
ference between his and Conner’s
points of view. Conner, he said, believes
that economic conditions for the poor
American worker will worsen with im-
migration; Fallows believes they can

’0?in improve.

Conner, who spoke in the Main
Lounge on “The Economic impact of
the New Immigrant," explained the
FAIR works to end illegal immigration
and to find a “Reasonable level“ of
legal immigration. in order to ac-
complish this goal, he recommends
“Conner's Five C5 of Immigration
Reform," which are: 1) Control the
periphery of the us. against illegal im—
migration, including both ports of entry
and open borders; 2) Close the loop
holes that make it easy ior people to
mani ulateﬂz immigration laws; 3)
Cut the magnet oi jobs which attract il-
legal immigrants; 4) Cap legal im~
migration _ at least until illegal entry
.is stopped; and 5) Contribute to the
economic development and population
control of our “source" Countries.

To give a perspective on his
arguments, Conner outlined the history
of U.S. immigration and the debates
surrounding immigration since the
19203.

Conner perceives two great domestic

issues in American life which “wash
over” the immigration debates in this
country — the williLts iLtween rich
’and poor, and between blacks and
whites. He believes that these issues
Cloud our understanding and make it
difficult to agree on a definitive im-
migration policy.

Through the 19205. Conner said, dii»
ferent races were thought to be inferior,
and iurihermore, lrish, Italians,
Yugoslavs, and other immigrants were
thought to be different races. From loss
to 1920, immigration figures swelled,
averaging 6-700,000. according to Can
ner. However, Conner reports, the
racial resentment ran so high in 1921
that the restrictionists succeeded in vir-
tually stopping immigration altogether.

Despite the inieriority idea prevalent
in American society. the contributing
role oi the immigrants in the economy
undermined the racist hold on im-

migration policies, and economic
arguments stole the spotlight in the im-
migration debates. ,

Conner views the economic role of
immigrants as a two~sided issue. One
side claims we need more immigrants
because they work harder than
American workers, bring special gitts
to their trades, and instigate the growth
of the economy. The other side argues
that if the immigrants were removed
lrom the work iorce. a shortage of labor
would encourage higher wages for
laborers, This, in turn, would give in
centive to industrialists to increase pro-
ductivity, which would finally result in
a more just society and a more produc-
tive economy.

Conner believes that when immigra-
tion is limited, the economy is not. He
points to the period oi American history
between 1921 and 1965 when immigra-
tion was low and the economy ﬂourishr
ed as evidence for his theory. While he
admits this evidence is not conclusive
of the inverse relationship between the
immigration level and the economy
level, he also draws upon a parallel in
Europe and Japan to illustrate this

point. After WWII. France and Gel-A

many allowed immigranb to enter
their industrial work force: llapan did
not. In the decade between 1972 and
1982. the economic growth rate oi Japan

doubled that of either France or Ger»,

many. countries which are now paying
immigrants to leave,

The worst economic effect of im-
migrants, Conner feels, will ”drive a
wedge" between the existing upper and
lower classes, widening the gulf that
separates them. One-third of the
American labor force receives within
thirty cents of minimum wage for their
work. When the supply or workers in-
creases. the wages decrease.

The advantages of immigrant'

workers, said Conner, are that they are
willing to work tor less. they stay longer
in one job, they work harder. and they
send someone else in their place if they
are unable to make it to work.
Because at these qualities, some
employers find immigrants more
desirable. In fact, Conner described the
prevalent attitude among southwestern
ranchers as, “you can’t run the ranch
without wetbacks.” Thus, American
workers are displaced and Jobs are
plentiful for immigrant Workers.
Conner envisioned other serious con-
sequences oi the immigrant intlux as
well. The greatest threat is inordinate
population growth. With the current
rate oi immigration increasing, Conner

said. the 235 million population of the '
us. could expand to between 360 and ,
350 million in iiity years.

Conner contended that the population i
strain on the environment would be
devastating, He warned of an increased '
level of acid rain and carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere along with the increase
or nonrdegradahle wastes.

Conner summarized his perspective
by declaring that “immigration is out
of control. too high. and needs reduction
immediately,"

Reacting to Conner's perspective.
James Fallows‘ ejected. “Oh, calm
down."

During his speech. “Immigration:
How It Is Affecting Us." Fallows drew
some conclusions about the “setting" of
