Court throws out stripping suit
Rutgers students forced to bare it all see case dropped

By Eric Griffith & Bryon
Koczmorek
NEW BRUNSWlCK, NJ,
(UtWIRE)—A lawsuit ﬁled

~ngalnst Rutgers University by two

former players and a former team
manager, alleging that they were
rotted to run sprints naked in prac.
tice two years ago by head coach
Kevin bannon, was thrown out or
Superior Court in New Brunswick
Friday

“The judge's actions speaks for
itself," Bannon said after the deci-
sion in a prepared statement, “The
Facts were presented, the decision
has been made and now it‘s time to
IUOVC OILn

According to published reports,
superior court Judge Nicholas
stroumtsos Jr, said the three failed
to orrer any proof that they were
humiliated, harmed or that they
were victims ofsexual harassment

during the practice,

Former Rutgers basketball plays
ets le Johnson and Josh Sankcs
and former team manager Juan Pla
claimed that Bannon rorced them
to participate in a strip Contest that
required them to remove a piece or
clothing after each missed tree
throw, on Dec. 27, 1997.

The three were seeking men»
ctary damages from the University.

In a prepared statement. Uni-
versity counsel David Scott said,
“it has always been the universitys
position that this case did not be
long in a court orlaw.

"We are very pleased that Judge
sttoumtsos agreed."

stroumtsos cited the fact that
communal undress and showering
is eommonplace among athletes,
and that was one or the main rea—
sons why he tossed out the lawsuit,
according to published reports.

“They require suiting up before
games and showering arterwards,“
stroumtsos said, according to pub-
lished reports.

In Scott's statement, he said
Judge sttoumtsos ruled that the
contest . . even irtruc, did not
eonstitute a viable lawsuit under
New Jersey law."

Athletic Robert
Muleahy was also pleased with the
outcome.

“We’re happy that it's over. i
think the facts speak for them»
selves,“ and Mulcahy, “It's time to
move on and improve the pro-
gram.”

After completing the 199738
