During the summer, Grinnell
College's physical characteristics
underwent both major and subtle
changes The dorms. the science
building and the library have all
been transformed in some manner.

Heading the list oi mayor
projects continues to be the
renovation of dorms. Clark Hall
already has been finished and
James Hall optimistically has been
targeted ior an October completion
date, Work inJames is progressing
smoothly and on schedule, ac-
cording to Vice»Provost Ken
Browning. The only major change
in James is the elimination of
sinks. due to prohibitive costs,

Hall should be completed some
time in the spring of 1979, ’

ln James, some iioor plans were
changed due to the need to increase
bathroom space, but students'
rooms will be as close as possible

to their original dimensions. Also
in James. curtains instead of doors
will be attached to the closets.
Under the drywall in all dorms will
be a sheet of Styrofoam tor In-
sulation purposes

A SECOND MAJOR summer
undertaking was the addition to the
science library. Formerly
inadequate both in hook and study
space, the library‘s ﬂoorspace will
now be more than doubled, Ads
ditionally, heating and air con
ditioning systems will be ims
proved. Better quality tables will
be installed and perhaps most
importantly, a more logical
division 01 materials will be in»
stituted.

Also, the extra space should help
take some of the pressure oil of
Burling Library. The new facility
is expected to be adequate for 20
years. Work should be finished
either this month or next,

. Report gives Grinnell a mixed review

by Dan Flynn

A recent report challenging the validity

THESE SHORTCOMINGS. Coupled with
the basic ideological differences between

ONE OF THE departments that is
hardest hit by the report is the English

a rather awkward exs

with specialized learning at this level.”
"OUR EDUCATION," contends Con»

oi Grinnell’s educational philosophy has
produced a generally negative reaction on
campus.

Implicit in the report is the View that the
liberal arLs program at Grinnell must be
seriously rerevaluated»and possibly even
drastically changedifor the college to
survive. The report contends that in many
areas Grinnell's academic departments
are “oblivious to the World" of change that
is going on in higher education. The liberal
arts tradition at Grinnell, according to the
report, is in danger oi becoming “merely
. banal." and needs “more relevance and a

clearer approach to broad social
problems,"

ISSUED FOR THE Commission on
Institutions of Higher Education of the
North Central Association oi Colleges and

0 Schools, the report is the work oi a team oi
four evaluators who Visited the college in
February of this year, The report, part oi
the regular tenryear review of Grinnell's
accreditation. is generally positithhe
team concedes that What Grinnell is doing
it is doing welliand recommends that the
accreditation be renewed.

A variety oi responses have greeted the
report, including criticism of the report's
writing style. The report is poorly writ-
tenwne English professor went so far as
to call it “Illiterate.” Seemingly con-
tradictory passages leave readers
questioning the report’s actual points.
Poorly chosen words further muddle the
report’s meaning. Misguided metaphors in
. tspots give the report an almost comic

one.

 

the evaluation team and the Grinnell
iaculty, make the report susceptible to
being lightly passed oii, President Turner
is cautious in this regard. “We must be
careiul not to write on the report because
‘they don’t know what we're about’. . .
True. it’s hard to deal with attitudinal
diiierences, but we can deal with speciiic
criticisms,"

Most of the report, however, does not
iocus on speciiics, Parts oi the report that
are critical oi Grinnell's educational
philosophy are generally scoiied at by
iaculty. But when the report does address
speciiics, there is usually more
agreement.

SPECIFICALLY. THE evaluators find
three weaknesse at Grinnell. First, they

. call lor more research about Grinnell

students and about the eiiects oi a
Grinnell-style liberal arts education. On
this point Turner agrees, and adds that

'this kind oi research is being planned tor

the future. Next, the team sees a need (or
the college to address the reasons for
attrition and enrollment, Here again
Turner agrees~but adds that the report's
inflated attrition figures are "plain
wrong ” Finally, the report cites a need to
reorganize governance structures so that
they can function more efiectively. This
process, according to Turner, had already
been started this Summer, when the
Executive Council absorbed the Long
range Planning Committee.

But when the report keys in on depart
mental shortcomings, support on campus
is more difficult to find.

 

department in
tended metaphor, the report calls the
humanities “tight little islands unto
themselveseisolated and not Iully aware
that the waters are rising. ,." The report
implies that inhabitants of the English isle
are in the most danger of being swept
away by the incoming tide. The depart
ment is less “ ‘liberal' than I had expected
of a liberal arts college." it states.

Peter Connelly. English department
chairman, agrees with this comment. but
considers it a plus oi the department. He
says, “No English department in the state
spends more time teaching English than
we do. They teach everything but
Englishewe are a classical English
department." He iurther contends that
humanities at Grinnell are innovative,
pointing to the freshman tutorials and
team-taught humanities courses as
examples that are being imitated
elsewhere.

llE ADDS THAT Grinnell graduates are
not drowning in the rising wateis alluded
to in the report, His personal contacts with
alumni indicate that Grinnell grads have
little problems going into their chosen
areas

The report implies that Grinnell should
spend less time preparing students for
graduate school, and more time readying
them ior business life. Ronald Kurtz,
chairman oi the iaculty, doesn't agree.
“We don't have to apologize ior our ability
to prepare students for grad school. Our
students read well, Write well, and think
well. They can adapt better than students

 

nelly, “is the difference between getting a
job in 1980 and doing it well in 1999 ”
Besides English, the report also singles
out the physics department “Ex-
periments in the physics laboratories," the
evaluator contends, “are those one would
have expected to iind 15 years ago."
CHARLES DUKE, physics chairman.
does not quite agreee, He asserts. “Sure,
some of the labs are like thatibut Others
are doing more advanced work, The
evaluator was only here [or about 15
minutes; he can’t learn enough about the
department in that period of time."
Throughout the report the evaluation
team urges that Grinnell try new areas.
They [eel the Curriculum is too traditional:
”The liberal arts of and for the twentieth
and twenty-first centuries, however, are
not precisely the liberal arts oi the iii-
teenth century, nor oi the eighteenth. . .not
even the early twentieth century.”
ACCORDING TO THE report. the
biggest problem preventing im-
plementation of these innovations is the
Iaculty. The team finds that “an attitude
of arrogant complacence, .seems to
pervade a larger proportion of the iaculty
than it ought to," .
To support this, they point to the inter»
, disciplinary area oi American studies,
l The department, they say, is in trouble,
i The number of majors has iailen, and
1 “traditional departments would shed no
l bitter tears ii American Studies would
disappear , .ireeing iaculty ior more

traditional course work,"
