Pioneers lose

13er Rowers Busts

Last year, a pass or two was the key to success in
Grinnell Football's home opener, a one-point win
ayinst Cornell College. Last Saturday, a pass or two
may have given the Pioneers rhe boost rhcy needed as
they lost to the Cornell College Rams zsezl,

“There were a few plays here and rhere that we
needed to make for a different outcome," Head F00?
ball Coach Max Hawsey said.

Led by Hawsey, who returns for his second season
as head coach,sthe Pioneers mtched their ﬁve'polnt
lead at halftime evaporate, only to come within an Orr
side kick with less than a minute left of erasing their
sevenrpoint deficit,

While Grinnell nearly marched Cornell in pass-
ing yards, Cornell rushed for nearly a hundred more
yards than Grinnell. One interception gave Cornell
a 60-yaid return for a touchdown and another pre
vented a touchdown for the Pioneers,

In rhe fourth quarter, quarterback Mike Bogard
’12 lofred a pass to a Grinnell wide-receiver for what
seemed to be a Grinnell touchdown to tie the game.
However, the Rams came Up with the ball for an in-
tereeption.

“We had opportunities and didn’t rake advantage,"
defensive end John Hereford '10 said. “It was really
small mental mistakes that allowed Cornell back in
the game and allowed them to get their lead.”

“The quarterback’s the key to the offense,"
Hawsey said, “There's no one more frustrated than
Mike Bogard.”

Bogard rushed for 58 yards, as well as complet-
ing 15 of 36 passes, with three interceptions and two
touchdown passes, both to Robert Seer '12. Kelsey Da-
vis '12 would score Grinnell's only rushing touchdown
of the day with two minutes left in the first quarter.

“Kelsey Davis has been very consistentionc of

home, opener

rhosc gnrys you can certainly count on," Hawsey said.
“He’s a playmaker for us, and we've got to get the ball
in his hands even more,"

On defense, Hereford led the team with 15 tackles
for the day, and as a whole, the solidly spread defense
held Cornell’s offense to 21 points,

"Ben Johnson played tough all day and the defen-
sive line did well. Curtis McCoy and Kyle Lobaugh
did a great job ofhaving pressure on Cornell’s ouare
terback late in the game, which allowed us to get a lot
ofstops," Hereford said

“We should hewinnin games ifwe' only giving
up that much [on defense ." Hawscy said.

Tomorrow, Grinnell matches up against Midwest
Confelencc heavyweight 5t. Norbert. Last week, the
st. Norbert Pioneers topped regional powerhouse
Warthurg college with an overtime touchdownThe
team is led by junior quarterback Rob Berger, who
rushed for 127 yards in 16 attempts and completed
28 passes in 37 attempts for 317 yards. Berger nicked
up two rushing touchdowns and four passing touch-
downs in the 4235 Win.

“Even more so than the last game, we have to limit
mistakes and make them work for cveryrhing they
get. we have to drive the football down to get poinrs,"
Hereford said.

The Duke returns—
Runners, fans,
alums pumped up

By ELIZABETH PEARCE

lr's blg.

it's long.

And people love it.

The Men's and Women's Cross-
Country teams are running in rho Les
Duke Invitational this Saturday at 10

‘ run. at the Oakland Acres GolfCourse.

The Duke, which is one of only two
home meets this year, showcases over
1000 runners and 25 teams.

“We don’t have a lot of home
meets and it‘s really nice because the
swim team comes out to cheer and a
lot of students
and parents come
out to watch,”
Lindsey Wheeler
'10 said. “We ,6,
ally like to see
familiar faces out
rhcrc. For people
who haven't seen
crosvcountry
races before, it's a
really intense (EXT
perience."

“On some
parts ofrhe course
you feel like you're
running through a
tunnel or people
and noise," Men's
Captain David
Montgomery '10
said in an e-mall.

This weekend
will mark the 46th
annual Lcs Duke
and competitors
are coming out in
droves to get a piece ofthe course.

"It's going to be a huge field be
cause we’re hosting the NCAA re
gional meet again in November," Head
Women's cross-Country coach Evelyn
Freeman said. “Most of these teams
wtll come to run the course and get a
feel for the course before running in
November."

But the competition isn't the only
attraction—the meet generates a lot of
excitement for several groups on came
ptlsr

“All the swimmels come in their
speedos and Russell K [Osgood] is
running this year." Erik Jarvis ’12 said.
“But my favorite part of Les Duke
is the day before the meet the Men’s
and Women's team get naked and run
around campus saying come to the
meet."

Because Les Duke is not only a
major invitational, but is also hosted
at home, many alumni runners will be
returning for the event, both to mm,
pcrc in their owa division apart from
the college, and to support the current
team.

“It’s really exciting because we're
celebrating 35 years ofGrinncll wom-
en's cross-country and 30 years of Ev—
elyn coaching," Captain Nora Colter
'10 said.

The alumni will be seeing a lot of
new faces rhis year, with 10 first years
contributing to the largest Women’s
team in history. A record 42 Grinnell

be sat/5n?

”Obvious/y, we’re no! going to //€
aboul warning 0 repeat of last
year Winning the conference
and gelling pnsl the Region to
Nationals would be a great nt-
tomp/l'shmenr Bur we’re no! gas
ing to swear then just yet. We’re
famed an [ralnlng hard and rats

For me personally 1‘th is my last

women went our for this year's team
and Freeman feels that the freshman
class is reﬂective of the team as a whole.

“The freshman class has come in
with a lot of strong talent,” Wheeler
said. “They seem to have really good
attitudes Our coach talks a lot about
how everyonc contributes and the nice
rhing about running at Grinnell is that
there's 42 women on rhc ream right
now, so if you're not in the top seven
you're in the bottom 35, which is nice
company to be in,"

The men are also included in that
company

“We are two
different teams
[the Men and
tht: Women] but
at the same time,
especially outside
of practice, we're
very close." Cole
ter said,

Jarvis sees the
two teams as ale
most inseparable.

“Having Will
and Evelyn as
our coaches and
married is per-
fect symbolism
for thc teams,”
Jarvis said “We
eat all our meals
together, most of
us sleep together
and we do our
homework tar
gerher.“

Due to last
year's success,
the Men‘s team has entered this season
ranked 26th. At the Midwest Confers
encc Championship last season, the
men who refer to themselves as the
Purple Roos, won with a perfect score
of 15, for only the third time in his-
tory, and qualified for the Divison 111
National championship,

“The ranking is a testament to the
strength of last year's team more than
anything else," Chris Wilson '11 said
in an email. “I’m encouraged by what
I've seen so far this year in practice, but
Saturday will be the real test,"

However, that doesn’t mean that
the ranking is not a source ofpride for
the men.

“It’s exciting ro scc rliar Grinnell
Cross Country is beginning to be re-
spected nationwide."Monsmmcrysaid

But more important than the rank-
ing, both teams hope to have success
come the end ofthe season.

“Obviously, we’re not going to lie
about wanting a repeat of last year,“
Tim Hcderman ’10 said. “Vi/inning
the conference and getting past the
Region to Nationals would he a great
accomplishment, But we're not going
to sweat tharjust yet.We're focused on
training hard and racing fast,and that's
that for now. For me personally, this is
my last Les Duke, so 1 just want to go
out rhcre and feel like I left everything
I could on Oakland Acres. If that's how
Saturday turns out, rhen Ill be satis-
fled."
