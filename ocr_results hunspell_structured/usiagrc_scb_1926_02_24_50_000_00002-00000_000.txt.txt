PREI’I’UG-

Now is approaching the time of year
when prepping o'r hazing, the roost an-
cient ol collegiate customs, comes in
for a concerted attack by both students
and faculty.

Freshmen, with the largest part oi
their probation period over, but with
the memory of the sting oi the paddle
still too fresh in their minds, are in-
clined to iavor some authoritative rul-
ing, either by students or faculty, to
make lite easier for the inture genera-
tion of preps.

Faculty members, having heard ev-
aggerated reports of violent prepping
during the year, and they themselves.
perhaps alumni of a school where oor-
rective measures by upperrlassmen

/were unknown or prohibited, also wish
for a change toward moderation.
Discussed by Men.

The topic is discussed in classes
conﬁned to_ freshman men, in iaculty
circles, and in talk fesls at the dorms,
What can be, and has been done by
such agitation, is well known to
upper-elassmen. For the most part.
the preps themselves are not for»
sighted enough to anticipate their air
titude when they become sophomores
with authority to wield a paddle.

Two years ago, led by a few faculty-
members, the men of the freshman
class signed a pledge promising to rcr
luse to assist in a paddle parade dur-
ing the remainder of their college

. 'i ‘career, and the next fall, the move-

ment gaining impetus by the converv

sion of a few influential upperclasse ’

men, the paddle parade was abolished.

Personally, the freshman paddle par
rade, of which we were a part, has
become one of our best memories or
our yeiu's at Grinnell. but there is no
doubt that such it parade had its (for
lectionahle features, and much as We
hated to see it go, perhaps the college
is better off Without it.

Abolish All Preppingi

But should this spirit or reform cork
tinue until all prepping is abolishedl
There are iew even among the faculty
who will answer “yes" to that ques-
tion. Personally we are in iavou oi
prepping or a sort, but the real ques
tion is, to what extent should student
opinion allow upperclassrncn to go in
carrying out prepping?

We are ﬁrmly convinced that prep-
ping can be a help to a ‘lreshman. It
teaches him that there is a great deal
of lite which he does not know, and it
makes him able to appreciate that
there are others who know :1, great
deal more than he does. We have
seen ex—collcge students, and those
Who were obliged to quit with only a.
high school education, start out to
work in the some oilice, and by his ate
tituile toward the ”old-timers", it was
not hard to Point out the man who had
undergone prepping. lie was willing
and eager to be shown, and hill] ll rlol‘r
erential respect for Experience which
made his coworkers glad to teach
him, and which was entirely lacking
in the other man.

Paddle a vital Part.

Of course all prepping is not con»
ﬁned to paddling, but there is no doubt
that the paddle is a mighty vital part
01' it. It is too true that sometimes
here in Grihnell there is a good deal
of unnecessary paddling, which we be-

lieve should be curbed, but we would
not ccusol- the whole puddle system
because oi those who let a littlc au-
thority go to their heads.
inept, we believe needs correction as
much as the cocky lresbmau.

'l'llut BIC-

‘ch admit that there is a good deal
oi rcugh run in middling our [l'csllr
mcn when not necessary, [or we have
done it ourselves. There are those
who will say, "Spare the paddle and
spoil the prep,” which may or may not
he true, but what we advocate is to
spare tnc paddle when using it for
amusement, but never when used as a
corrective measure.

Till-l or )1 o.

Altogether too many of us come to
college violently suspicious of new
ideas. We are satisﬁed only as long
as our preconceived notionsﬁpreju-
dices, llerllapsireceive lull credence,
and we object strenuously to any fresh
breeze or thought that disturbs the
half-truths in the ﬁling cabinets ol
our minds. College men and women,
seemingly, are not exempt lrom hue
manity’s common weakness for tradi-
tion, however fallacious it may be, or
irom humanity’s rejection of iorward-
looking concepts, thought they be rear
souable and sound.

Men like to believe that their par-
Licular opi
similar convictions can be held only
by fools or heretics. War is the ulti-
mate result ci this gloriﬁcation of self-
esteem, of this determination that

the past three hundred years. it has

but the social sciences still remain to

Colleges are the product of this new

this desire for freedom of thought
irom enslavelnent. They bargain
away their heritage when they submit
to repression of inquiry. Education
tang into disrepute when it becomes
the agency for furthering current Elise

is to open the mind to truth.

A ,0 r )1 TEST.

Victory is a grand thing, and it is,
moreover, delightfully palatable to
take, Defeat is also grand, but’ it is
far more bitter to the taste. Therein
lies the big difference. The courage
with which we swallow our defeats,
then, is the test of our, inner strength.

That Grinnell’s cagers have been
taking the short end of the score in
many of the games this season should
be no cause for a lessened interest on
our part. To display wild and urir
boundﬁd enthusiasm for a team with
a winning streak is simply human na-
ture; but to support it just as enthusl»
astically when the scores come out up—

At Chapel
This Week

Monday

“l. G. Ray, editor of the Gi'inl‘lcll
Herald and mayor D! Grinnell spoke in
chapel Monday morning on VVashing-
ton's birthday.

Taking up the life of \Vashiugton
chiefly from the business man's point
of View, Mr. RAY avei'red that great
men can only be judged by the age
in which they live. According to that
test, WI . Ray believes that “rushing-
ton is indeed deserving of the place
which history has accorded him.

A well known pulpit orator, Said
Mr. Ray, once astonished a, great many
people when he brought {orwai‘d the
idea that one of the biggest elements
in progress was death. There is a.
lot OI truth in such a statement Ma)"
or thy pointed out, for the vocabulary
ol the rising generation never seems
to contain more than a. single word,
”can."

Had the British not been so lazy
and shirtless, they might easily have
destroyed all the American troops
that were camped at Valley Forge dur-
ing that cruel Winter, 'Mr. Ray stated.
\Vhttt made Washington great was the
fact that he realized the weakness of
his own itl'my and concentrated all his
forces in a manner which turned dc-
leilt into eventual victory.

Dean J. F. Findlay presided in
chapel Tuesday morninv. lie read a
very interesting letter from Fol est
Chapman, 4 , who Since his gradua-
tion has been teaching in connection
with the Grinnellri 'llinit movement.
with his headquarter in Tetcilow.

“Chapme‘s” letter, Written in the
form of a journal, covers a period or
several weeks. He said that {it the
time oi his writing conditions in his
vicinity were very unsettled, and one
could expect anything from bandit
raids to open Warfare most any mine

happened to alarm the townspeople.
and it was getting harder and harder
to keep students in school. He Snake
particularly of sentry squads being
organized to keep watch during the
night over the grounds and buildings.

Chapman has seen a good deal of
actual warfare around Tecbow. Sev-
eral times he was sent out with the
hospital crew ‘lo bring the wounded
back to the American settlement, and
be described the terrible condition oi
the invaded towns, with their closed
shops, merchandise stolen, their de-
sex-ted streets, and their terror-strict?
6D people.

He Went on farther to say that the
authorities had decided to close the
schools several weeks earlier than the
usual New Years vacation, because of
the unsettled conditions.

The letter ended with Merry
Christmas wish to all Grinnell friends,
and a. hope that the New Year would
bring peace and harmony once more
to China.

OUR lil-lD'l‘llE STORY.
HOW SAiNT PETER CAME TO BE
ELECTED DOOR KEEPER or
HEAVEN. ’
Good evening dear children! once
upon a time there was a college that
had a newspaper. This newspaper-

wus called the Scandal and Bunk. Any-‘

way there was a column in this babe
that was known as the Doric. This
column was a source of great Joy to
the (12' ~ little boys and girls who
went to school thcle, and the curse
oi the laculty, Weliuone (lily the bus
iuess manager of this paper asked to
write the column for one issue. The
editors, being very kind hearted as
well as broad minded, gladly gave her
permission. The business manager was

i

a sprightly dame, then in lull posses-l

sion of her senses, aud there was no
reason why permission should he re
iused.

To cut a short story shorter: the
business manager died. After search
ing vainly for many years, she finale
ly located Heaven. W‘alking cone

liden'tly up to the gateway she pound- i
ed lustily upon the pearly gates. After ,

a lew minutes wait an old bewiskered
man thrust his head out between the
pearls. Cobwebs adorned his whis -
ers because business was poor in
those days! ,

saint Joseph (for that was his
name) wiped the dirt out of his eyes
and inquired, ‘Vell dearle, vat can 1
do for you.”

The bus. mgr. answered, ”i thought
I’d drop around and locate. Here’s
my card.”

Saint Joseph took the card and coin-
pared it with his records. a few nil ,
utes pcrsual was enough, Looking
gravely over his spectacles, he said,
“Your record is very, very bad. Away
below average. But you look honest
and, if you can name one good deed you
have ever done, I might reconsider
your case."

The bus. mgr. thought hard tor a
long time (she had to) and finally, air
tcr scratching her well shingled dome
vigorously, she burst into an enthus-
iastic exclamation or “lVliy 1 edited
the Doric.”

There was a moments oppressive
silence, Saint Joseph's eyes became
dilated and he dropped dead. saint
Peter got his job.

Epiloque: Rumor has it that the
bus. mgr, alter t ;ing to get into hell.
finally went back to the Scandal and
Bunk.
