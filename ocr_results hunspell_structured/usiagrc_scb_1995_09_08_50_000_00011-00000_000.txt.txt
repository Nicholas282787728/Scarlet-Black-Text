When the Grinnell College
women‘s soccer team begins its sea»
son atIIIinOisCoIIegeand Monmouth
this Saturday and Sunday, the Pio—
neers will be ﬁelding a vastly differ—
ent lineup from the squad that air
lowed only one goal in nine games
with South Division opponents last
year. Gone aresixstarters, including
three all—conference players and the
top two scorers, as well as the head
coach.

Despite these losses, rookie
coach Jenny Wood, former Grinnell
starplayer,srillmaintainsIoftyhopes.
“We'd like to host the conference
tournament, which will happen ifwe
winourdivision."saidWood. While
the soccerwomen have won all of
their South Division matches since
1988, Wood plans to be cautions
about guaranteeing Victory in any
match. “I‘ve beenoutofthe areafore
a couple of years, and we don‘t know
what division coaches have done in
terms of recruitingorwhat theirplay—
ers have done to improve their game

over the summer," noted Wood. "We
want to approach the conference
schedule one game at a time, and we
won’t take anyone for granted."

Ar striker projected starters are
seniorKendra Potz,whodid notplay
last year because she was studying
abroad, and sophomoreIiIl Paulsen,
who scored four goals last year. Ac-
cording to Wood, “We are very deep
atstriker this year,so itwill be tough
to get some players a lot of time."
This is reflected in the fact that the
kickers’ returning scorer with nine
goals last year, junior Amy Robin—
son, is not a projected starter. Other
players vying for time at striker in—
clude senior Amy Goldmacher,
sophomore Sarah Slack, and rookies
Mia Devrne and Ani Orantes.

The soccerwomen will start a
relatively young group at midfield,
with juniors Molly Moilanen and
CareyRodehefferstartingatoutside
midfielder, and sophomores Emily
Fargione and Maura Bartel projects
ed as the center midfielders. That
group produced eight goals last sea«
son, with Fargiane scoring three of

Shannon Chipman. arid rookies Kar
rie Wiltshire, Heidi van Home and
Betsy McCaIIon should also contrib—

Both co—captains willanchorthe
defense. Senior goalkeeper Kathy
Hansen, who took over at goal in
mid—season last year, will attempt to
keep the form that saw the soccer—
women shur out eight of nine divi—
sion opponents. The woman whom
she replaced in goal, senior Sara
Schoen. will lead the Pioneer back—
field at sweeper. Other defensive
starters are projected to be sophoe

well as senior Gail Seabold and jun»
ior Cara Braun at outside fullback.
Both Seabold and Braun have just

scrimmage against the alumni last

Rebuilding While maintaining excellence

Excellence has became not only
a goal but a tradition in Grinnell
men's soccer in recent years. Grine
well has won the conference champi—
onship four out of the last ten years
and has qualified for the conference
tournament in six of the last ten
years. This season promises to be no
exception to the Grinnellsoccertra
dition. Coming offback—tcrback con»
fetence championships the team
hopes to equal last year’s season by
stayingundefeated in conference play
and by winning key games against
Macalester, St. Olaf. and Colorado
College. According to Head Coach
John Ffitsch, these games will be
critical in determining whether the
team is able to qualify for the nation«
al tournament.

After losing the annual alumni
game 43, the men’s soccerteam will
start their regular season at home
this Saturday at 1:00pm against Illi-
nois College. Although the [Cam

lost Sunday, the game was a crucial
step in the rebuildingprocess required
due to the loss of seven varsity play—
ers from last years team. Key players
lost from last years team include full-
back Dave Eslinger and goalie stand
out Nate Brennamen, The replace—
ment of these key players and several
other defensive players is a priority
for this years team. Several new
freshmen players are likely to fill the
open defensive positions. Key fresh»
man to watch include: Shawn Hoy,
Darrin Bass, Tomas Redondo, Dust—
in Goot, Brian Viscente, Warren
Morrow and William Lee—Ashley.
In addition to the freshman players,
this years team will consist ofa num—
ber outstanding returners including:
Neil Goodspeed, Chad Stewart. Ryan
McCary, Senni Kamara, Florin Citu,
Dimiter Georgiev, Barret Thomas,
and Seth Kleiman.

This years team is somewhat dif»
ferent from previous years teams
which have traditionally been de—
fensive powerhouses. Instead of an
impenetrabledefensetlns years team

is likely to rely more heavily on the
offensive strength of strikers Chad
Stewart and Neil Goodspeed. In
particular, Neil Goodspeecl. who is
one of Grinnell’s all—time leading
scorers. Will he a powerful scoring
threattoopponents. Goodspeed and
Stewartwiththe help ofwingsSenni
Kamara and Dimner Georgiev and
midfielder Ryan McGary compose
Grinnell's offensive threat.

The defensive unit, although
young, also shows a great deal of
promise. Freshman Shawn Hoy is
likely to fill the vacancy at goalie left
by Nate Brennamen. Although he
has bigshoestofilI,Hoy,amemberof
the All—New England Select Team,
has demonstrated that he has the
quickness and agility necessary to
step up to the challenge. In addition
to Hoy, returning players Seth Kle—
iman, Josh Bornhorst, and Barret
Thomas will bring poise and experi—
enceto defensive unit. Otherplayers
whoare likely to play in the backfield
are freshmen Darrin Bass and Dustin

After a fun—filled weekend, the
Grinnell College women’s tennis
team is ready to “get down to busi»
ness." On Saturday the Pioneers are
slated to take on Midwest Confer-
ence foe Cornell at 10:00am.

Last weekend's run Doubles in
Waterloo, IA. gave firsteyear coach
David Arseneault a better look at
thlsyear’steain. Overall, Arseneault
was pleased wrrii the non—scoring
results.

The No. I doublesteam consist—
ing of Nicola McCIung and Kim
Knous won three of four matches on

the day. They beat the Loras No. l
and No. 3 teams and Cornell’s No. 2
unit, whilesuccumbing toLoras’sNo.
2 team. Against the No.1 Loras team
McCIung and Knous rallied from
being one set down to force a tie
breaker in which they won. The
result was a tollin orinnell victory,
57, 6/1 (13rII).

ferent from those in a regular game.
l‘We wanted to take a weekend to
play a good game against friends.
While the alumni team has a lot of
good players imost have graduated
within the past four or five years and
stillplay in leaguesiwe weren’tout
there just to Win. With so many new
faces on the field, we had to go out
there and learn to play together.”
Wood remarked that she was partic—
ularly pleased with the play of her
defense, adding that, ”We faced the
top two scorers in schoolhistory, and
our defense only gave up two goals.
They had their hands full and did a

nice job."

As for this weekend’s long trip
to Jacksonville and Monmouth,
Wood said, “It will be tough to open
up on the road, but the fact that I
haven’t been able to learn a whole
lot about ouropponents may help us.
I won‘t let us approach any game as a
sure win 7 we’ll have to focus on
Illinois College, and then shift gears
and get ready for Monmouth." Even
with the sweeping changes that the
kickers have undergone, history sug—
gests that this road trip will be a
successful one.

When the Grinnell College
men‘s cross country team hits the
hills this Saturday at the Cornell
Ram Run, there is more atstake than
just one meet. The Pioneers will
beginto buildasquadthatcan add to
the nine—consecutive Midwest Con
ference titles November 4 at Cor
nell. If the harriers win the tenth
championship, they Wlll eclipse
former league member Carleton’s
record of nine straight.

Coach Will Freeman enters his
12th season as the Pioneer mentor
With three allrconference runners
returning ftomhis 1994 lineup. Gone

is individual league champion Chris
M ills.

“We are in good to very good
shape starting the season. Over the
summer we had four runners train at
altitude. Oursights are strictly set on
the conference meet. The early meets
will help us gauge our training,"com—
merited Freeman.

According to Coach Freeman,
junior Andy Nassiff is in the best
shape at this point. Nassiff earned

allrleague honors by placing 14th at
the loop meet in 1994. Two other
juniors, JoshWardandRonnieWeed,
head up the top group. Ward placed
third and Weed went sixth in the
conference. Another junior, Austin
Ramsland, who has been injured for
two seasons, is in shape and anxious
to prove himself while classmate
Shannon Robinson could break into
the top seven. Coach Freeman’s top
freshman, Neil Gipson, an all—state
runner from Nebraska, set the sec—
ond fastest mark in a team time trial.
Jarrod Becker and Brendan O'Fallon
are other rookies who have caught
the coach’s eye.

Two track athletes, sophomore
Kevin Notheis and junior Bryan Re—
bar, may find their way into the line—
up. Both runners posted solid marks
last spring in middIErdistance events.
Sophomores Kentner Cottingham
and Nat Hopkins occasionally ran in
the top seven last fall and may get
another opportunity this season.

“Every team, and its dynamic, is
different. The mix of the squad is
developing and I like this group.
We’re very optimistic about our
chances," concluded Freeman.
