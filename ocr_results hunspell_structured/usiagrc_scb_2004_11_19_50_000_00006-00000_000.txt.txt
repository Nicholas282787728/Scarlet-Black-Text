Collateral (PG

Tom Cruise as a villain, folks. A villain.
That megawatt smile that won the hearts and
minds of the Iraqiiwait, the Americanrpubr
lie is now nefarious, a ne’errdoewell. Sure, 01’
Jerry Maguire has been a short cocky jerk tons
of times, and strayed as far as a vampire and
Vietnam vet, but he's never ever been the bad
guy. Which makes col/stem fun.

Cruise plays Vincent, the consummate
traveling professional killer who knows a lot
about his job and about jazz, out on a night
of errands in L. A. His unwitting getaway
driver, a cabbie, Max (Jamie Foxx), knows the
streets like a bad cliché. Max wants to escape
the urban repetition to an island vacation. He’d
probably like to share that island with Annie
(Jada Pinkett Smith), his last customer before
Vincent.

The city ofsntog has been filmed exhaus
tively. They even tried putting a volcano in the
middle of L.A., in l’plmna, just to see what
it’d look like, Yet the LA. night looks starkly
original in Collateral, with slow overhead shots
differentiating all the neighborhoods lit by un»
foigiving streetlights. Part of the unique look
comes from the highcnd digiml cameras that
give the city plenry ofgrain, colol and grit.

The guy behind Cal/11mm is Michael
Mann, arguably the king of the crime drama.
col/arrests plot feels right out ofau episode of
Miami Vite, a showMann helped create. Cruise
and Fox): hop around ethnic lo»
cales, going to a black jazz club,
a Mexican restaurant and an
Asian nightclub, with Cruise
killing his targets. Cruise’s com»
puter, which he relies on to learn
about his next victim, doesn't
really make sense, but in mov-
ies computers have become as
magical as Harry Potter’s wand

Foo quickly ﬁgures out the
conceit and does his best to fail
Cruise‘s job. Both of them are
tired or their jobs and are err
need by the thrill of this night,
Collateral ends in a fashion as
AllvAmerican as Cruise’s smile.
Some people will bare it because
it's derivative and slow, but I
think it‘s a fun ride. Not a thrill
ride, but a nice ciuise through
the city.

The closest cousin I can think of to this
dry, bittersweet comingrofragc movie is The
Graduate, though this time there‘s no Mrs.
Robinson The ﬁlm was masterminded by
Zach Braff, who writes and stars in this, his
directing debut. You wouldn’t think that this
toner star could pull off such a sweet, quirky
ﬁlm.

Braffstars as Andrew, who goes by Large,
a lost ZOrsomething soul who returns home to
Jersey for his mother‘s funeral. He‘s been living
in L.A.,working as awaiter and trying to hit it
big in acting (although his only success to date
has been playing a mentally impaired football
player in a made-for-TV movie).Thnnks to his
psychiatrist father (Ian Holm), Large has been
living life in a lithiueroloft haze, but when
he returns home without his medication, he is
unevpectedly forced to deal with real lite,

This movie is one of the few whose
soundtracks I absolutely loved, and whose
music was as much a part of the film as the
characters themselves. There is, of course, an
appearance by The Cindi/ale heroes Simon and
Garfunkel with “The only Living Boy in New
York," as well as songs by Coldplay,Thc Shins,
Frou Frau, and Iron 8c Winc's version ofThc
Postal Service's “Such Great Heights."

lts characters are not the
most normal of people. Sam
(Natalie Porrman), Larges love
interest, is a funky, fesity epi—
leptic who lies to make heiself
more interesting, and his high
school best friend, Mark (Pen
ter Sarsgaard) is a potrsmoking
grave-digger who steals flom
hardware stores. But despite the
fact that you've probably never
met people like them, the chart
aCters feel very real and vely lov-
able.

Gard!!! Stu/t just narrowly
avoids “comingoﬂage” and
“coming home to ﬁguie out
your life" cliches, but does so
with grace. From the synopsis, it
sounds like a movie you've seen
a million times, but trust me"
you haven’t seen this one.

The film is refreshingly
simple and stands on its own
two feet. And when Sam says
that listening to The Shins can
change yout life, you mity just
have to agree.
