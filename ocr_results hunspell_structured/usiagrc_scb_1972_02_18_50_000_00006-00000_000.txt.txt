Discuss Honorary
Degrees, Course

by John Wylie

Criteria ror recipients or honorary
degrees and consideration or a pro-
posed “press and public policy“
course in the Political Science De-
partment occupied the attention at
the Executive Council in its Februr
ary 2nd meeting.

Mr. Avison and Mrs. Palmer (train
the Development and Alumni offices
respectively) asked that the Council
set some derinite guidelines tor the
selection oi recipients oi honorary
degrees.

Avison commented that no such
guidelines had existed since the ad
ministration of President Bowen.
Because he and Mrs. Palmer,as well
as many others, are orten asked to
recommend someone to receive an
honorary degree, he tell that some
concrete guidelines to be used inthe
selection process should be estab-
lished.

The matter was being relerred to
the Subcommittee on Honorary De-
grees. and a deiinitive proposal was
expected shortly.

Mr. Stephen Johnson’s proposal tor
a course on the press and public
policy was the other major item on
the agenda. His proposal would re
quire an additional part time in-
structor. Since-the Political Science
Department will need a part time re.
placement ror Mr. Hottois, it was

decided to rerer the proposal to that ‘

department tor a recommendation.

However, Mr. Hotlois indicated that
the Political Science department has
yet to be contacted. “The first we
heard of it was in Campus Memoto-
day”. He personally felt that the
course would not be offered unless
it was produced through the Come
munications Department.

from the neck down Planned Parents
hood has been coming out to the
campus once monthly lortaiks; along
with their advice and the use oicon-
traceptives, students are being more
tree with sex,

As a result the Sex Education Subs
committee suggests that physical
sex is not enough, and the emotional
counterpart must be consideredtoo,
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Marge Daly advises, "Sexuality is
more than biological sex, it is all
those things you do, think, and say
as a result oi your biological sex.
Emotions should be developed
enough so that the physical aspect
is more meaningrul."

Mrs. Daly will continue to advise
students in birth control, but this
year she is also cooperating with the
Sex Education Committee for a film
festival to provide information about
how to cope with the emotional as-
pects of sex The lilm lestival, "The
Shapes of Love", will be held this
weekend, February 18720 Mrs.
Daly, along with the Sex Education
Committee, hopes that the campus
will take a more active part in the
program and attend the inrormative
film festival. There will be dorm
raps later.

Included in these sessions will be
such topics as the Praying Mantis
Theory which depicts the American
temale devouring the male once she
is impregnated. The Male Masoch-
iStiC Theory portrays the reverse of
the Praying Mantis Theory as ltpro—
lesses that the male must exert his
power over iemales in order to prove
his masculinity. In essence Mrs,
Daly and the Sex Education Sub-
committee are aiming toward this
goal: “(to) Move through these
hypotheses to a new awareness to
a sense at responsibility to others
while meeting one own’s needs",
as stated by Mrs. Daly.

leggell Back

President Glenn Leggett returned
here last night, and he will be back
at work Monday.

Mr. Leggett’s return journey trom
Seattle to Grinnelt completed a two
month trip around the world in which
he visited Rio de Janeiro, Kenya,
Australis and New Zealand, and
Hawaii.

President Leggett was not iniormed
ot the action by black students at
the library, presumably because he
had just arrived.

A grant from the Danlorth Foundae
tion covered most or the expenses
or president Leggett’s two month
leave.

Non credit art workshops have
been a very popular ieature of the
Grinnell curriculum ever sincethey
were first offered in 1961. This se-
mester is certainly no exception:
most at the workshops have long
waiting lists of would-be students,
and during registration on the cold
Saturday morning of January 22,
students were waiting outside the
Fine Arts Building as early as 5:00
{or the 3:00 registration process,
and one girl slept overnight in the
building.

The number of workshops is
greater this semester than it has
been tor the past couple or years.
They include: Casein Painting (Mr.
Cervene), Silverscreen Printmaking
(Mr. Klein), Drawing (Mr. Klein),
Weaving (Mrs. Wieman), Ceramics
(Mrs. Zirkle), and Jewelry (Mr.
Zirkle). Most workshops meet from
two to four hours a week asagroup,
with most students putting in cons
siderable additional time on their
own.

Good rnr Beginners

Eight students are being instructed
by Mr. Cervene in the art oi casein
painting, a media employing opaque
water colors. Casein is amilk-hased
pigment which, ‘iike transparent wa-
ter colors, is mixed and thinned with
water. However, unlike regular
water colors it can be applied to
masonite, canvas, and many sur»
races other than paper. Also, since
casein can be easily painted over, it
is inexpensive and excellent ior be-
ginning painters to work with, Still-
liles and casein collages are among
the projects being undertaken in this
workshop.

Mr. Klein’s silverscreening work-
shop emphasizes the basic techni-
ques or this crart, with little em—
phasis on the actual design of the
prints. All nine students will coins
plete a glue stencil and a cut iilm
stencil Clayton Lee, a very compes
tent student printmaker who now
serves as a resource person, will
assume more control of the work»
shop when the students have mas-
tered the basic techniques.

Individual Art

The drawing workshop, which Mr.
Klein describes as more loosely
structured than his printmaking
workshop, has an enrollment of
seventeen students covering the
whole spectrum or drawing ability.

model, but Mr Klein s critiques or
the students' works are on a highly
individualistic basis, due to the wide
range or art backgrounds and skill
represented.

Mrs. Wieman explains that her-
weaving workshops cover “anything
made with yarn” (yarn here meaning
any type at thread) The iiiteen stu—
dents make their own weaving de-
vices, on which they have weaved or
will weave such projects as god 5
eye, macrame cord weaving, book
bags, etc. They will also experiment
with inkle (tape) weaving and bead
weavmg,

The ceramics workshop is working
together as a class now, but should
advance to individual projects by
mid semester, according to Mrs.
Zirkie The ten students, most at
whom are novices, are now working
on a slab construction not.

Bower at the Beginning

All nine students in Mr. Zirkle’s
jewelry workshop will have as their
project either a pin or pendant. ln
pursuing this project, they will be
instructed in designing the piece or
jewelry and in such techniques as
sawing, tiling, and polishing. Silver
and exotic woods will be the two

media used.

In 1961, President Bowen, who had
a deep interest in the line arts, in
augurated the program oinon-credit
art workshops and had the ceramics
and jewelry studios turnished in the
newly completed Fine Arts Building,
Mr. and Mrs, Zirkle were broughtto
Grinnell solely to conduct these
workshops, but were gradually as-
similated into the art departmentas
regular protessors. It is out oithese
workshops that the crafts program
here originated.

Mr. zlrkle teels that the workshops
are very valuable to the Grinnell
community, particularly because oi
the opportunity they provide tor nece
phytes to do some work in the fine
arts. Mrs. Zirkie enjoyes the tlex.
ibility ot the workshops and their
"no deadline” atmosphere. Shealso
thinks that the knowledge that many
other students anxious to participate
are on waiting lists makes the lucky
students appreciative oi the work
shops and therercre willing to put
forth their best effort. However. Mr.
Zirkle questions how much longer
they can be ottered, as the art dee
pai‘tment members are presently
“simply overworked”

So you have nothing to do and would
like to do some light reading? The
men's room in the (drum is the place
to go. Visitors to this john are
greeted with every kind of assorted
grallitti from the philosophical to
the vindictive to the downright oh-
scene, (Those terms are, oicourse,
arbitrary.)

For those who like a good argument
you can find it in the third stall 7 it’s
between the Jesus people and the
skeptics. The argument is too
lengthy to repeat here, but is has
its lighter side; “Jesus saves,
Moses invests” says one sage. A
thoughtful Skeptic asks “Why should
Jesus waste his time messing around
with you egotists who think you‘re
worth saving?"

Some thoughts on the Grinnell edur
cation: “The Grinnell education is

say , “Grinnell is populated by per-

answer (question?) tor him e “This
looks pretty serious." nnother
writes, ”A Grinnell education has
left me too proud to do the only type

“School gets in the way or edu-
