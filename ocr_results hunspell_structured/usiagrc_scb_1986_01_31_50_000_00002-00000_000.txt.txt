Vietnam, China,

by May~lec Cliai

While Visiting campus Thursday.
January 23. Asian studies specialist
Michael H. Hunt of the University of North
Carolina of Chapel Hill. addressed two ma
jor issues iacing our nation: viet Nam. in
his convocation speech. “The Cold War in
Asia‘ In Search of Lessons;" and “The
Special Relationship: the US. and China"
that evening.

More than a decade alter the withdrawal
of American troops from Viet Nam. the
US, has discovered ”Viet Nam is not a
stick that can be tossed away, but a
boomerang." according to Hunt,

'The Viet Nam “boomerang" has recentc
ly “come back with peculiar force” due
primarily to the unwillingness oi the peo-
ple directly involved in the war — jour-
nalists as well as veterans 7 to forget the
war and the Reagan Administration's ac.
tlvism in the Third World today

However, Hunt feels that because of its
“achistorical” and “ethnocentl'lc” evalua-

’ tion of the Viet Nam War. the U S, has
learned only a superficial lesson. A larger
vision that goes “beyond simply how to
handle aiiairs in the Third World . . . [and
addresses] how to relate to the larger out
side world" is necessary (or survival,

Hunt stated. “This will require a
transformation of U.S. selt»cunception and
ideology Without this transiormation oi
outlook. mistakes like that [Viet Nam] can
happen again.”

Hunt attributed a large part oi the
“crisis oi sell-conception" that lollowed
the war to the ideologies that pushed the
U.S. into the war in the ﬁrst place.

He cited the View of the US. as
"defender of freedom”, a sense oi ethnic
superiority with “Orientals near the bot-
tom rungs. ,as subhuman gooks". and a
“strong concept of appropriate revolu-
tionary behavior that follows constitu-
tional form and restraints ”

These views led policymakers to feel the
Vietnamese “didn't need their own revoluc
tion but the one We'd lead them to." Hunt
contended.

In his evening lecture on U.S.-China
relations. Hunt similarly warned against
expectations of ”transforming China into
America’s image "

The U.S.'s “special relarkmnshlp" with
China historically ha ru \lYl cycles oi
-' ‘shared attraction : lwithl divergence
oi expectations.” he said. Although cur-
rent relations are;posltive,~“any policy
ltoward China] must be sensitive to the
lragility oi the relationship."

Hunt asserted that a shift in any of three
basic Components oi Sine-American rela»
tions — economic development. the

R. and Taiwan 7 could tip the

‘s to the historically precedented

wayside. "it is very easy to imagine .
lgomgl to the negative side of our special
relationship. . it is highly dynamic, and it
will take a lot of nurturing and a. . a
lowering of expectations [to maintain} "

Grinnell Prof Publishes Book

From follege Public Relations ("lice

Thomas Hietala. assistant professor of
history. has recently published a book.
“Manifest Design- Aiixmus Aggr'ndlze-
menl In Late Jacksonian Americ
the Cornell Univerisity Press

The book reassesses popular beliels
about "inaniiest destiny" by reexamining
the diplomacy and politics otprevCivil War
Democrats

Hictala questions the rhetoric of mission
and destiny. and instead analyzes
westward expansion in terms oi how intern

rial social and political discord was turned v

into externally-directed development
The acquisitions of the l8405, however,
brought problems.
Hietala observes in the preface. “Confi-
, dent that territorial expansion would an
courage nationalism and ioster internal
harmony. Democrats discovered that it “1'
stead exacerbated partisan and
geographical divisions and ultimately
preClpitated disunion and CiVil war."

Noting a disturbing inconsisency bet-
ween Amel‘ican ideals and actions. Hietalii
demonstrates how the expansion 5 ol the
.Jacksonian period “accepted an imperial
pl'esldencey as an agent oi aggrandice
ment and discriminated against and
dcspolled nonwhite peoples whom they
deemed unworthy of liberty in seltr
government in the acquired territories."

The book evaluates the historical undel’c
piiiiiings oi the rise oi the United States to
a world power. Hictala suggests that this
historical background is indispensable to
understanding current American ioreigii
policy.

This raises new questions about the rela-
tionship between westward expansions,
race relations. partisan politics. inc
dustrlalization. and democratic ideology,

Hietala was born in Biwabik. Minnesota,
on the Mesabi Iron Range. and earned his
B.A irom Gustavus Adolphus College and
his MA. and Ph.D. from Yale. He has
taught at Yale and Dartmouth and joined
the Grinncll faculty in 1985.
