Grinnell hosts Young Dems convention

riv Ditvrn H. MONTGOMERY

in 2004, young voters in the lowa Democratic caucuses made
up 17 percent of participants—well behind the 27 peicent of
caucus-goers who were over 65, according to CNN: cntiance
polls. In 2008,youth turnout tripled, with the same percentage of
caucustgoets under 30 as over 65. Simply a product of exciting
candidates and a compelling presidential race?

Perhaps, But last Saturday, 40 students from around the state
gathered in the Forum South Lounge to discuss how to trans
late the current Democratic strength among youth into sustained
electoral dominance at the annual College/Young Democrats of
Iowa (CYDI) Convention.

“The lovm Caucuses sent a clear signal that the base of the
Democratic Party is young voters," said CYDI Presrdent Alec
Schicrenbeck ’09, who was reelected at the convention, “I hope
we're building an organization that can withstand the natural
decline in voter enthusiasm that will come after the general cleet
tlon,"

Delegations from close to a dozen dittcrcnt chapters braved

threatening weather for a day ot'training ses s, elections and
pizza. “[onc goal] is just to get College and Young Democrats
in a iooin together, meeting each other, and comfortable with
the idea that they can go to one another
for help,” Schiernbeck said. “You also want
to provide certain training, teach people
about things that have worked on other
campuses,"

Attendees were positive about the eye
pcticnce of the convention. Mai-k Bowers,
a leader of the University oflowtt Demo-
crats, said he thought the networking that
occurred at the convention was invaluable.
“It's so hard to organize students," Bth
etc said, “and ifthe groups can be organized, then we can better
organize the students."

Karl Oldﬁeld,a member ofthe Coe College Democratscame
away inspired by some of the tactics shared in a strategy session
by Grinnell College Democrats co-leader Meredith Decker '09.

“I heard here at Grinncll, some peoplc did a moustache came
paign and wore moustaches around campus [on Election Day] to
getattcntion,"01dlield said,“I thought that was a good idea,"

Participants also listencd to brief
speeches from House Majority Leader
Kevin McCarthy and dueling congressio-
nal candidates Rep. Leonard Boswell and
former state Rep. Ed Fallon

The presence of political leaders left a
particular impression on attendees “I think
it's great that they arc actually embracing
college students," sard Bowers. "The stu-
dent vote is huge, and it you utilize that,
then you can win elections."
The politicians themselves spoke highly ofthe Young Demos
erirts and the value of dialogue. “I think it’s important to hear
what you have to say," said Fallon, “But it’s also of interest
to hear what established polieytmakers have to say. I think the
exchange is invaluable in both directions,"

The work also
raises the question of how to balance pro-
tection of individual rights with protection
or free speech, but both Levine and Decker
think that the nature ofthe incident meant it
was not protected as free speech. “It doesn’t
really fall under the realm of free speech,”
said Decker, “because they
were directed at individut
als and there is no room
for them to defend theme
selves."

One avenue Levine
and Decker said they have
looked at is the expansion
ofcurrent an rrhullying and harassment leg—
islation to include postsccondary educational
institutions.“Why can‘t we get the same kind
ofprotection here?" said Decker. “I’d like to
see colleges and higher education institutions
be covered under antirBullying legislation"

According to the antirbullying law,Titlc
VII Seetion 280.28. all public and private ace
credited elementary and secondary schools in
iowa must “adopt a policy declaring harass-
ment and bullying in schools [and school~
related activities] as against state and school
policy."

But Brad Clark, Director of Policy and

Education with one Iowa, an advocacy or-
ganization for queer rights, disagrees with
Levine and Decker and said that the exten-
sion of the anti-bullying law would not prove
effective. Clark said that the “extension of
the state school bill wouldn’t do anything in
this case." The law, in effect, only mandates
that schools establish inthouse antitbullying
policies, does not establish
any criminal penalties or
even classify harassment
or bullying as punishable
acts under the law.

Grinnell college al-
ready has an anti-harass-
ment policy, the penalties
for which range riam warning to dismissal
from the college. The policy deftnes harass
ment as any act that threatens in individuals
health or safety, damages or threatens to
damage property or otherwise substantially
interferes or threatens to interfere with an
individual’s “access to educational programs
or extracurricular activities."

Sheree Andrews, associate dean and di-
rector of Student Life, said she believed
that the policy was applicable to the letters,
“I think the letters created a threatening,
hostile environment,” said Andrews. “And
it did interfere with or had the potential to

interrerc with [the students] academic or
extracurricular perrormance because people
were scared." Charges ofharassment are filed
through security and decided by the College
Hearing Board.

While the Grinnell Police Department
said the letters could not be called a hate
crime, Clark said he believed the acts were
covered under extsnng laws,
“My understanding of the case
is such that its may be already
covered under other statutes,”
said Clark. Instead Clark rec»
onimenclcd pursuing “the ac-
tual enforcement of the law.
Right now it is included in
state antithate crime law.”

An examination of current Iowa laws
by the 88:8 suggested, however, that cure
rent laws did not apply to the letters incir
dent. According to town Title XV'l section
729A.2 only (our crimcs may be classified as
a hate eiiinc: assault, criminal mischief, arson
and trespassing. Grinnell Police Chief Jody
Matherly said that, while the mailing; are

as a hate crime,

laws do not cover ha-

”/l’; ext/ting to think that we [DU/d
have a hand in changing an lowa

rassment," said Mathetly, “The harassment
laws are serious but hate crime law typically
applies to more serious incidents"

William Buss, protessor at the University
oflowa college of Law said that classifying
incidents ofharassment as hate crimes might
be politically more difficult. “A lot of things
that people think of as harassment are often
in a manner whlch
might be protected
under free speech,”
said Bussi

“I can sort of see
why [allowing ha-
rassment to be a hate
crime] is entering into
the domain of freedom of speech," he said.
“[And there] the very strong rule rs you can’t
distinguish between spccch you do like and
speech you don't like."

Despite the debate over the political pros-
pects and legal merits of the project, it has
generated excitement among some students
on campus and established new connections
between groups. “it's exeiting to think that
we could have a hand in changing an Iowa
policy," said Margie Scrbner'10,co-lcadcr or
StoneCo (and 5693 Design Editor). “And I
think that could be one of the most positive
things that comes from the incidents.”
