WALTER WELLMAN IS COMING.

Instincirve Lecture to bo Given hyn
Thoroughly Capable Man.

The second number of the lac-

ture course u'lll be given Wed»
December I7.

when \Valler Wcllrnan, the distinr

guislred correspondent or. the
Chicago Record llerald will ap-
pear beiorc a Grillncll audience.

The subject of his lecture is
not known deﬁnitely but it is
expected that he will speak on
"Behind the scenesat Washing-
ton,” a subject on which he is,
perhaps. the best informed man .
in the country today. His long
residence in Washington has ena-
bled him to become acquainted
with all the leading statesmen of
the day. and he can. without
doubt, tell many interestingthings
of congressional and diplomatic
life.

Mr. Wellman is not only a news
paper reporter or the highest type
but a regular contributor to many
leading magazines ot the day.
He has travelled extensively and
is well able to speale on whatever-
subject he chooses.

We believe that Dean Main
touched the right chord, when he
remarked. a l‘clv)cnl's ago, “that
we want to hear rucn who work;
men wllo are engaged with the
problems or Me in the wart
today.” Mr. Wellnlali is truly a
man of this type. and we are
fortunate in having the opportu-
nity to hear a man who stands in
the trout rank of the world's
wollrers.
