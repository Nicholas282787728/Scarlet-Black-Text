Impassioned images by German Expressionist
printmakers grace Print Study Room

by Michael Kavanagh

During the first few decades of
this century, a group of German art-
ists began experimenting with print
media in dramatically new ways, one
of whichwastheirrevivalof thewoodr
cut as a viable form of artistic expres
sion. a method which had not been
used extensively since Medieval
times. Known foran innovatively sub-
jectivestyle,theseartists emphasized
the tumultuous era of post-World War
I Germany in their art.

Post-war Germany was charac-
terized by rapid change, due to des-
perate economic conditions such as
rampant inﬂation and severe food
shortages. These conditions spawned
widespread political unrest, armed
conﬂicts between competing leftist
factions and popular uprisings. But
the government which was formed
following the war. the Weimar ReA
public, was also known for its cul-
tural pennissiveness which provided
a political climate conducive to the
ans; indeed. artists ﬂourished inGer-
many during this time.

All these conditions inﬂuenced
the an of the Expressionists, who
considered the depiction of very hu~
man issues their primary concern.
They concerned themselves with the
strife of their times, choosing to por-
tray human ﬁgures as isolated and
alienated from their environments.
Their art is often dark and almost
sinister, due to an infatuation with
death,themacabreand thegrotesque.
Taking an anti-war stance and pro-
claiming the faults of the government
and opportunistic industrialists and
bankers, theExpressionists ﬂourished
during the Weimar vears, but were

prosecuted once the Nazis took conv
trolofthccountryin1933iTheliberal
cultural climate of Weimar was gone,
and theNaziofficialswhocondemned
the Expressionists’ art organized a
huge exhibition ofit, toured it around
Germany and touted it as emanate
Kunst (degenerate art). This exhibir
tion was organized to teach the Ger
man public all that was wrong about
theWeimaryears,andtoshow graphi-
cally what they felt to be the collapse
of traditional German society. (Inci-
dentally, the emanate Kimrt show is
the single most widelyrattcnded art
exhibition in history.)

Opening today in the Print and
Drawing Study Room here on cam-
pus is an exhibition of German Ex-
pressionist prints. Consisting of 30
prints by thirteen artists, the exhibir
Lion “Impassioned Images” proves to
representtheExprcssionistmovement
quite well, with works from Die
Brticke (the Bridge) and Neue
Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)
schools.

A good example of the personal,
emotional attitude of many of these
artistsisaprintbyErich Heckel(1883-
1970) endLled Mann in dcr Eberte
(Man on the Plain). This print shows
a man in deep despair, his hands raised
to his forehead in a moment of emo-
Lional pain. His sunken, black eyes
probe directly, almost deﬁantly into
the space in frontof him, challenging
the viewer to doubt the man’s sorrow.
His ﬁgure is setagainst an expansive,
turbulent background which creates
an atmosphere of flux, yet sets the
ﬁgure in isolation. Since this is a
woodcut print, the starkly contrasting
lines delineate the man‘s emaciated
features and mark his strain. The

woodcutalso affords the man’s envi-
ronment a sense of animated turbu-
lence.

Indicative of the Expressionists’
interest in the grotesque is Otto Dix's
(1891v1969) drypointDompleuer, or
Tamer ofWild Beasts. Otto Dix deals
most often with social issues in his
art, typically depicting the pttiablc
condition of those left in poverty in
the aftermath of WWI. This particu-
larprintshows a woman, with a monr
key—likcfacc,voluminousbrcasts and
dresscdtn alow»cutbustierand spike-
hoeled,knce-high bootsThiS woman
carries a bull whip in one hand, a
revolver in the other, while wearing a
holsterandaskullrshapcd beltbuckle
around herwatst. This disturbing fig
ure evokes images of prostitution,
sexcrime, sado-masochism and mur-
der. This “dominatrix" vision exem-
plifiestheculturalclimateofthetime:
sexual promiscuity and violence, the
volatile German society.

The same issues can be seen in
Paul Kleinschmidt’s drypoint print
called Zwei H unde (Two Dogs). This
printshows two snivelinghoundswith
pig snouts for noses, glazed, rabid
eyes and sharp claws. The artist has
taken some license in his representa»
tion, creating an almost fantasy im-
age. Tnis is what deﬁnes Expression-
ist art: to introduce an element of
subjectivity into the anmaking pro—
cess, to let one's emotions appear in
the finished product. Subjective,
highly emotional images like Zwei
Nitride were ptevalentamong the Ex»
pressiottists, espousing their infatua-
tion with such grotesque and disturb-
ing subjects.

Katthollwitzwasan artistwho
remained outside the Expressionist

circle, but who worked around the
same time and took on many of the
sameissuesasartistslikel—leckel,Dix
and Kleinschtnidt. Her lithograph/{us
Folge Tod (Call of Death) depicts a
figure being touched on the shoulder
by a sltriveled hand entering the pit}
ture plane from the upper right hand
comer. Thedark, androgynous ﬁgure
holds its hand up, with an extended
index finger, as if in protest. The
pitiful,wcarisome face, \vithitsclosed
eyes and pursed lips demands an
emotional response from the viewer.
The fact that Kollwitz created this
print in Germany in 1934 (after the
Nazi seizure of power) attests to thc

factthatthisartistwasnotcondemned
by Hitler's government. Shc was
never included in the Entartete Kunrt
exhibit because her art was considr
cred “acceptable" and closer in style
to the 19th Century ideal of German
Romantic art.

The prints in “Impassioned Imr
ages" ponray the issues of their time
with a technical and emotional inten-
sity \vhtch had never been seen be
fore in western art. Seeing these gror
tesque and sometimes saddening
worksmayprovetobedisturbing,but
they are beautiful in their technical
achievement and their success in ex-
emplifyingtheeratnwhichthey were
created.
