SC Discusses Delay Il‘l Yearbook, Hansen Wri’res Original Opera
Votes Money For KGRW Study

Ill its regular Wednesday meeting, Student Council
named an interim committee of three to develop a progress
report on the 1957 Cyclone. The action followed extensive
inquiries by several senior men and other students regard-
ing contractual obligations and fulfillment of production
schedules by present Cyclone directors and staff. The other
business was concerned with KGRW.

Special SC Group

Examines Cyclone;
Time Lag Revealed

By Jim Won, Quimby Day,
and Cathy Foster

All inquiry into the status
of the 1957 Cyclone, made
yesterday by a special coms
mittee of the Student Coun-
cil, showed that progress on
the book is behind schedule.
Certain steps must be taken im-
mediately if the book is to be
produced at all.

The largest single problem
seems to be the taking of organ—
izational pictures. There, are
some twentyvfive organizations
still to be photographed, as well
as all spring sports. The com-
lnittee worked out a schedule so
that all of these pictures will
be taken by May 25.

Th: Staff has many inform-
al and social photos that will
be included in the book, But
the committee did find a lack
of hall informal shots, and
recommends that students who
have any sllch pictures turn
them in to the editorr

Another problem is in the
preparation at lay—outs. No copy
has yet been received by the
publisher, but some of it is in
the final stages of preparation.
The committee recommended
that the editor recruit help from
experienced students in order to
finish this stage of the book.

The ﬁnancial affairs con—
ncctcd with the book are in
good condition, but there are
still some organizations and in-
dividuals who have not paid
their bills. ‘Thc committee
recommended to the business
manager {hat these be collect—
ed Within the next week,

It is the opinion of the com-
mittee that the inefficiency from
which the book is now suffer-
ing can be eliminated with more

An elaborate list of campus
organizations whose pictures
were reported to have not yet
been taken, with ono and one
half weeks of school remaining,
was submittcd by David Qulm-
by Day, past so treasurer, Ass
sisting in preparation of the list
were Darrell Fisher. Men’s Honr
or G president, John Egan, and
other prominent campus figures.

Jim Wolf, 1956 Cyclonc edi-
tor, reported on recent conver-
sations with Wellhouse studios,
usual Cyclone photographers,
and reviewed several letters
he had recoivcd from the
prospective publishers of this
year’s book, On the basis of
those, Wnli declared that there
was considerable doubt in his
mind that schedules were be-
ing met, or that they could be
met at this late data.

Sue Berna, present Cyclone
editor. stated that she was not
immediately prepared to make
a'point by point refutation of
the evidence, but that she would

be pleased to submit a detailed

written report if requested to do
so. She added that the contracts
in question had not been broken,
but had been orally modified
with the publisher’s representa~
tive, and that picture—taking was
proceeding apacc, although Well-
house was sharing the job with
the college information Service
this year.

It was finally agreed that be-
cause of the lateness of the date,
and in view of the current stu-
dent apprehension, that the com-
mittee of Wolf, Day, and so rep-
resentative Cathy Foster, should,
in cooperation with Sue, ascer—
tain the facts and make a pub-
lic report. This report appears
elsewhere in this issue of the
5&3.

In other action, KGEW was

careful planning. The staff, rin-
ancially, has no alternative but
to print the book. The commit-

tee is willing to help with this
job in order to assure the stu<
dents of a yearbook.

Merritt McCall and Wyndham Hunt rehearse lor Barbara Han»
sen’s honors project, “Pyramus and Thisby," which will bc pre-
scntcd in Main lounge Sunday at s and 9 pin,

yramus and Thisby," an
nal opera within a play,
will be produced by Barbara
Hansen in Main lounge Sunday
evening at a and 9.

Barbara, a music mayor, is
doing the opera as an honors
project. This will be the ﬁrst
attempt by any student in the
ﬁeld of original orchestration

 

and composition, especially
the production of an entire
opera.

The libretto for the opera is
taken from Shakespeare’s play
within a play, ”Pyramus and
This‘by” in “Midsummer Night’s
Dream." it is a kind of poor
man’s “Romeo and Juliet," deal-
ing with the tattered peasants
Pyramus and Thisby, who give
an opera for the unappreciative

king, quccn and court jester.
Their attempt results in a com.
plete farce. ,

The cast includes Dennis Johns
ston as Pyramus, Wyndham
Hunt as Thisby, Bruce Pauley
as Prologue, Mcrrit McCall as
Wall, Alan Fisher as Lion and
John Orsborn as Moon. Spook—

ing parts include the king,
played by Joseph Nassif, the
queen, played by Barbara

Farrics, and the jester, ‘played
by Alan Spioler. The audience
is the court.

The instrumental ensemble,
conducted by Barbara, is com-
prised of Heather Gelston, flute;
John McClenon, clarinet; Sara
Norris, bassoon; Gaila Gallatin,

 

voted 8100 for research on a
new type transmitter which
they hope to begin installing
next fall. Experimentation
will be completed over the
summer, and it was felt that
“probabilities of success with
this unit are greater than with
any other of its class,” accord—
ing to Wayne Donny (physics),
newly appointed consulting en<
ginccr.

Dick Scott, chief engineer,
and Bob Lucas, station mana-
ger, outlined a longoangc do.
velopment plan based on the

new device and calling for cap-
ital improvements approprla~
tions of $1300 over a twosyear
period. This would ha added to
$700 annual operating expense,
bringing the probable 1957758
budget request to $1500. This
will not be considered by the
council until next fall,

To the Students:

This letter is my personal as-
surance to subscribers_of the
Cyclone that the yearbook will
be published, and distributed in
the fall, as announced earlier.
Steps have been taken to in-
sure the progress necessary dur-
ing the remaining weeks of the
school-year.

A new schedule for pictures
will complete the file of all or-
ganizations. Presidents of these
groups have been contacted, apv
pointments are listed on the
bulletin board in each hall, and
notices will appear in the noon
announcements of the days the
pictures will be taken. The co~
operation of all individuals to
be pictured is essential to the

success of the book.

Men Seek Pledges.
Plan 60-Mile Hike

Two Grinnell men have an-
nounced they will attempt to
Walk 60 miles in 24 hours to

raise money for use by the
Board of Religion. Students
must contribute $75, or the

venture will not be undertaken.

Steve Levin, in a recent in-
terview, stated he and Amie
Alpert will leave from the
Union ncxt Thuisday oi- Fri-
day afternoon at 5. They will
travel along Highway 5 and

call in at check points to
Steve MacDonald, carsponsor
of the venture, to indicate
their progress, _

if Levin and Alpert reach
the capitol building in Des
Moines within 24 hours after
leaving the Union, the money
contributions will be turned

over to the Board of Religion.
If their attempt is unsuccessful,
the money will be reverted to
the donors. President Howard
R. Bowen will hold the money
during the trip, and will be in-
formed of its outcome by phone.

Harold R. Harding, alumni
secretary, said he will inform
the has Moinas alumni chapter
of the scheduled time of arrival
at the capitol building.

Levin stated “We plan to
travel light. Probably the only
thing we will carry is a
transistor radio." Approxi-
mately 325 has been raised
in cash and $50 in pledges.
When asked what the Board
would do with the money, Win-
ston L. King (philosophy and
religion), adviser to the board,
said possibly it would go to the
Korean student whom the board
sponsors.
