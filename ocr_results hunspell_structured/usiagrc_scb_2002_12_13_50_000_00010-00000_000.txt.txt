2006. Among d1L’ items announced to about 100 students

“It was kind ofcool," said Rachel Motlcowia. oiic ofihe
rnooming nvirts. "People mot us and remembeted its from
there "

Grinnell is home to what seems to be r stmrtgely high
number oirwrns. Almost one percent otthe student populae
lion ha a twin :idier on mmpus or elsewhere. Remarkably.
many of three students report having ororllent relau'onships
with their twins.

Julie and Joanne Perino ‘06

"\Ve used to ﬁght a lot up until eighth grade," said Julie
Pet-inc of her relationship with her twin Joanne. “Now we’re
like best friends; we get along (all)! well. i haven't tried to
dink: her sine: wc were seven!”

Fraternal twins from Springﬁeld, ill, the i'erinos look no-
dcmbly diﬂ”:r:nt from on: another. Beams: thcyai-csudi good
h-iends, they decided to room together at Grinneu.

"We know how to llv: togcd‘ner, we sham things," said
Joanne "it Just soemod like it would be easier [to be room-
rttatch.Whenwewere young Julredidn't like me. Now... we're
always there for aid-i other and we're good friends."

Julie end Joannealso think theysharerspecirl bond "You
spend so much time with this one person... They've seen the
same things you have ftirso many ymrs. it's like havinga pere
manent best friend who never lavas," midlulie or” her sister.

“[But] we’re really dilfetent," Joanne rrttetjocroi, pointing
out dint each has diffﬂent hobbies. "Uulie] ham running. I
like to run. sheliko softball better I'm more into scienoe and
madt and art than she is. she's more into liter-.rture and reading
and English. Even in swimming we don't do the same evens."

“I don't think there's much I ‘d change about Julie,” sh:
added with a smile.

Jon and Mike Dalgleish ‘03

“wewero terrorists," laughed Jon, when Mike toldostory
about the Minds of daeir childhood.- ”We [had] dim shins
dint said. ‘I’m Mike, he’s Jon,’ [and] ‘I’m Jon, he's Mlle) We
usndtoswitdi them on diebabysitters. Pmblemwas. weoouldn't
stop laughing so everybodywould know when we switched"

The Dilgleishcs are twins from Brunswick, Maine They
have no ida whether they are idenn‘al or ﬁarernal. “It’s an
intetadng qusﬁon,” mid Mike. "I thiiilt we’re probably £124
ternal. When you're born you tan have all these tern done to
make sure that you're one or he other but our parents didn't
do he tests. W: look alike, butwe’re norsure. You never know."

Jon and Mike are sure about their relodonship with one
another “We wen: great friends when we were younger," said
Mike. 'We'd get in the ocuslonal tussle especially with our
older brother, but we've always been rally great hiendc [If
you have a twin], you can always ﬁnd somebody to play bust
ketball with or somebody to chat oﬂ’ofdieir homewodc”

Though it’s cosy to mix up the Dalgleisho, they drink it's
important to note dtat people shouldn’t automatically group
them togedrer. Mike reloto that some people assume hey do
veloped oomrnon interests bcausc they're twins. “They think
that bomusc wc both do music. that ihit's something we do
bemuse wc‘t: twins.‘ Jon plays the French horn and Mike
play: theoboe. "Lfyout personal decisions ever coincide, people
am like, ‘diey won't branch out from each othet'"

"That's why we tried to keep out arademie errtlos sepa-
rate," addodJun. “We’re the perfect liberal nttssrtrdent I've got
die sciences. He's got the humaniuts and social SCIenccs."

Jon and Justin Jeffryes ‘03

His ﬁrst day on campus, a girl Justin Jeittyts had never
seen ran up to him to give him a gianthug. “I was llker ‘Uli. ..
I’m not Jon,” he said.

Although Justin spent his ﬁrst year at me University of
law, he decided that he wanted to attend a small college, and
he'd enjoyed visiting his twin brother Jon Jcﬂryt’s ‘05 at Grins
nell. “Gi-innell sacmed d-ie obvious choice," hesaid. “Jon being
here ms deﬁnitely a point in Gtinndl’s favor.”

Some people on ompusstill ooni‘use them ‘wedon't get
annoyed at nil," said Jon. “I our tell right away when someone
looks at me itthey think l'rthrsrin. i think, ‘This is going to be
embnrtsssing for them. How can i get out one"

Growing up in Sister. lows. theJeitryes were never tempted
to use their similar looks to plnyyokoa by "switching identiu'ts."
“As a twin, your identity is tenuous enough as it is." said Jon

Though “the Jeihyo boys" were always dose Fn':nds, they
also went through a stage of aggtosively tserting dieit indi-
vlduzl identities. “I was like, ‘I wont to be Justin all the times"
Justin said. “'I don’twant to be]on."'

"Here, people dortt think oius as collectively." he eonu'ne
ued “But one disadvantage of being o twin is that people is
some you're interthengorble. .. We had a boss in higr school
who said one time, you're btsimlly the some person, right"

‘We’ve had people ask us, ‘Do you fed errh others pain?"
saidJon. “And we're like, 'No.’ But sometimes w: do say entire
sentences that oornr out togedter, and beams: we sound so

 

much alike. people thrnic we're rterltt."

The Jetirye have many mutual friends, shore on interest in
theatre, and etc both English majors. This semoter. dtey took
their ﬁrst elzs together sinoe high school. ‘There's more ota
sense otoompetita'ort," said Justin. "it's like, ‘Oh, Jon just said
something. i bettersny something: it keeps me on the ball."

After graduation, Jon intends to smdy library seienee in
Wrsoonsirt. Justin plans to study publishing at gnd sdiool in
New York or Denver

“As twins, we only use our power for good," said Justin.
"it's like having a best friend all the time. Yay ovirtsl"

Kara and Rachel Mos‘kowitz ‘06

Since they were young Kora and Rarhel Moskowitz have
played on the same Soccer team. Kara plays center midﬁeld
and Pachd plays forward, positions dist rliow them to work
togedrer on the soeeer held

"Itwouldfodtt-nllyweitd not playing together." said Raehcl.
“There's some competition. but it's diii'erent. You're compet.
ing but you want the odtet person to do well."

“It’s rally hard if one person ismore suoceathrl," said Karo.

Fraternal twins from Wooster, Ohio. Kara and Rachel have
found not their shored estpetienos sometimes hdp them in
unexpected ways. 'We’re memely good Picn‘onary players,
even though we're not good artists,” srid Rachel.

Though they both play soeoer rmd share mrny friends,
their personality diiterences are quickly nppruent. orthe ttvo,
Raohel is the more outgoing. Kara is dieselideteribed “shyer”
twin. They also pursue divergent acidcmlc subjects. Rachel is
lnkrﬁicd in the social scimccs; Kai-a in the humanitits.

Havirrgatwinan benrttixed blessing. "Sometimes pcople
trmt us as ifwe're the same person for extended periods of
mine, but thus pretty rare," turd Raehel.

For Rarhel, the odvsnmges ofhavlng or twin outweigh the
disadvontngo. Beause they share so much, Rachel feels being
n twin makes hera better compromrser “it would be different
ifwc had: bad relationship," the said. “But we’ve always had a
good relationship."

Though they had he opportunity to room together, they
didnrseriously oonsider the option. “We’d probably kill errh
other," said Kan. "You don't have to act civil with yoursittet. ‘
But we're friends. It’s grott having someone there all the time."
