Londoners drink beer, get bombed

Grinnellians in London and Iowa still wondering about last term

by Ellen Heath

Communications between Gl‘innell and
London last [all were sporadic and vague
or so it seemed to us on the Grinnell-ln-
London program Students on campus pres
bahly knew as little about our semester as
We did of theirs. however. so here are some
points oi correspondence between the term
in London and that in Iowa

In London we learned that one of last
year's ireshman had bought the Longhorn
Naturally we did not believe the news But
when the Slots gave us the official word on
the sale. sent only two weeks late aiter
publication, we knew it had to be true.

While students in Grinnell were
discovering the new ~Horn. however, those
oi us in London were exploring the English
equivalents —— pubs“ 7

I've had a hard time trying to describe
the American bar to the British. This pro-
bably stems irom my comparative Inex-
perience With the U.S. counterpart. Pubs
are much easier to explain

In London there is always a pub within
walking distance,.usually on the next cor-
ner in such abundance, they seem to be
the main source of evening recreation.
Pubs are open every night but are busiest
on the weekends when they are packed
irom about 9 pm. until ll p.m.. nationwide
closing time.

At ten minutes before 11 the bartenders
ring a bell to warn patrons to buy their last
drink, At 11 they ring the bell again to tell
people they are no longer selling drinks
and are closing, A few minutes after 11 the
bartenders ask people to return their
glasses and at ii ’20 are still begging them
to leave

Pubs, short [or public houses, are also
open in the early afternoon and serve lune
Ches during these hours, You can have

vegetables and mashed potatoes, scotch

eggs which are boiled eggs wrapped in
sausage or a ploughman‘s lunch at bread
and cheese while downing a midday pint
A pint by the way is an imperial pint which
is larger by about live swallows than our
measure You drink beer by the pint or

The Longhorn and any American bar
would have a tough time comparing its
brews with the British beers Bitter. made

Carmel-colored beer and is the most
popular pub beverage in England. The
lagers, llke McEwans and Carlesberg. are
thicker and lighter in color. Stout or Guine

creamy ioam. Cider. not the innocuous
drink Americans know, is potent and
comes in many varieties. Bulmers of

would treat more like champagne

Other than their abundance and their
beer, pubs are different irom bars because
they are a lot older and they look it, Lon-

But pubs are not exclusively tor the
drinkers. You can also play a game of pool.

some establishments In small villages
pubs commonly have speciiic nights when
they host such games as dominoes and
cribbage.

The adjustment hack to the .Horn and
the campus Pub may be a bit strange at
iirst (we might get up and leave at ill but
I'm sure we'll make the transition.

Yet the Longhorn sale was not the only

news that managed to reach us Later on in
the semester we heard oi problems with
the legality oi Rowe's presidency and the
appointment oi the Judicial Council Apr
parently President Drake set everything
right. Too bad the samc cannot be said oi
Northern irish dilticulties with English
law, We experienced some oi their
disagreements in London during last fall‘s
Irish Republican Army bombings,

The lirst bombing in Chelsea reminded
us oi the continuing strile in Northern
ireland but i think most oi us put it in the
back oi our minds until the next occurence
in Oxford street, Oxiord Street is London's
most crowded shopping area and the
bombs there caused a bigger stir than any
other had Police evacuated the area and
the underground was not permitting
passengers to leave the stations along that
street. Every few minutes an announce-
ment over the P A. systems in the stations.
usually in a thick indian accent. told
passengers they should not even get on the
trains.

For the most part Grinnellians-ln-Lon-
don decided there wasn't anything we
could do about the situation so we
shouldn't put too much eiiort into worrying
about it Londoners themselves seemed
not to be aiiected by the bombings

I remember walking towards the
Leicester Square Underground station one
day after being turned away irom the
Charing Cross Station Police had cordons
ed on the station apparently because oi a
bomb warning As i rushed uptown the
Londoners I passed seemed oblivious of
die past and possibly iuture explosions. i
wanted to shake people and ask them it
they realized their city was being bombed,

But that was only a moment or passing
irustration. partly brought on by a grow
ing discontent with the urban atmosphere
and the crowds always getting in my way.
.This discontent was soon to be relieved.
though, by a move irom the city,

We needed no newspapers or letters to
tell us what was happening in Grinnell dure
ing the last month of the semester. Any
student knows that time is devoted to wore
rying about. studying tor and taking linal
exams

Those oi us in London. however. were
entering an entirely dliierent phase oi
study 7 Phase II. The 48 or so of us divided
into three groups. One group went to
Wales. one to Brittany and one stayed in
London. The Welsh sector divided Iurthel‘
and split between three towns oi varying
small sizes

As a member oi the Welsh contingent. I
cannot really speak on what thc other
groups were doing during this last month
oi the program But while We were getting
to know the socml and status structures of
our Welsh villages for Anthro 395 we did
receive a low Visitors irom London

The thriceedally train trom shrewsbury
delivered the Londoners to our largest
town. Knighton lpop c 250m We would
show them our pubs and the next day
they'd leave. Was Knighton that boring"
No. not really These people simply iiir

sisted on visiting us right beioi-e thcy hail
papers due

Actually. the London group probably
most nearly resembled Gi‘innellinnssiils
iowa at iinals time when we came in irom
Wales to London on the last day ol the
semester several Londonders were still
trying to write papers As lor the people in
Brittan). only they really knovi what went
on there.

Now that we're all back in Grinnell our
means are going to have do do some ex~
plainiiig What was it that kept them irom
writing frequent. news-y letters“ Are the
courses much more dililcllll‘ Has the
social liie suddenly become iri‘eslsltahle“
Or maybe we'll discover that the reason is
nothing much really happened and all our
wondering was Iormiuglit bloody ilvll
