THE RIGHT TRACK
(From the Montezuma Republican)

Griunell college men seem to be getting on the
right track, politically. Recently they organized a Re-
publican club and plan to send representatives to the
first ward caucus in Grinnell, with the hopes of having
representation on the delegation. This is far better than
sending a bunch of kids out over Powcshick county
trying to form a third party. Two political parties are
plenty. We have had enough of blcc rule. This writer
had to laugh several years ago at the efforts of a red-
headed would-be college orator trying to convince some
Deep River farmers that Bob LaFolleLte was the man.

NOTEBOOK PROFESSORS
(From the Indiana Daily Student)

Why students do not rise up in arms against the
practice of notebook making is a puzzle. Yet, after rc-
flecting on the frailties of human nature and the ease
with which these compilations are possible, it does not
seem strange. Professors themselves at times even set
the stage in readiness for the fares.

Notebook making is not an evil in itself. It is
possible to learn more through this route than many
others. The evils lie in the methods that instructors
use in letting these creations be prepared in certain
illegitimate ways and in the saroalled grading of the
finished product. with a little ingenuity, much of this
illegitimate procedure could he made impossible, and
could not the work of such nature that even such labor
as the grading of notebooks not be more Checking?

Why must notebooks always remain the same in ‘

content and style from year to year, for as long as a
decade in some instances7 Even such a simple device
as demanding that each student write his name at the
top of each page at least assures the professor that
the undcistudy has been compelled to sit himself down
with a pen in band, -
Typewritten notes are not favored by some instruc-
tois who forget that for many the typewriter is might—
ier than the pc‘n. Prejudiccs and suspicions are at once
aroused upon viewing such a piece of work. The pass

ib ’ty that some one has paid money to another for ,

the pecking of a typewriter looms large, eclipsing the

idea that mere might be one among the group who .f

actually did take pride in doing good work.
Invariably, large classes are of the notebook mak-
ing variety, yet does any professor think his students

will believe that he can employ any degree of interest .

in these innumerable individual compilations '2 Notebooks
could be both an efficient method of learning and at
the same time distinct proof that the student has may
Lel'ed his subject.

SUBDIVIDE THE UNIVERSITY
(From the Daily Northwestern)

The atlvisom of the Wisconsin Ekpcilmcntal college
published a report last week in which was advocated a

proposal for dwiding the largc and unwieldy modern _
independent -

universitica into small, selfrsufflciont,
groups. instead of a bulky College of Liberal Arts with
an enrollment in the thousands, we should have fifteen
or twenty much smaller colleges, each with its own
social organization and group interests.

it is believed that this proposed plan of academic
di
snobberies ant
under the fraternity system. With the growth and (le—
vclopment of our prcsent-day, large-scale univcrs
has come an increasingly complex and dlscordant situltr

tron among our fraternities and sororities, With the

result that today we are faccd in many quarters with
a virtual caste system.

We should effect the organization of many, co-
operative social and academic groups within a univer-
sity, their internal activity characterized by harmony.
vigor, and centralization of purpose and their external
connection with the parent university marked by con-
certed, organized action and nitciligcncc of aim. Many
educational leaders, elsewhere and within our own
Northwestern, bchcve this plan to be the panacea for
the American university's dangerous social illvil social
scheme which is sadly out of adjustment to its educar
tienal aim,

This proposal, in its present form, would afford
a greater stimulus to intellectual life on the part of both
student and i structor by virtue of the more intimate
contacts, in the classroom and elsewhere, which these
small college groups would provide. Independent study,
certain diverse forms of which are considered profit-
able by the majority of both students and professors,
would undoubtedly be more advantageously fostered
under the proposed plan.

on would abolish, to a great extent, the petty '
“cliques" which inevitably have arisen .

Poetical Workshop

“College Verse," despite its utter
seriousness, fulfills .an important
function in American poetry. The
pedagogy of this statement may be
forgiven in part once the attitude of
the student poet is understood. Pre-
ceding his writing is an extensive
period of reading of poetical liter-
ature, usually with no thought of
writing. As he comes into his intel-
lectual puberty, expression may take
place but not without a sense of hu-
mility to his subject.

Knowing this, the belief that pub-
lication is damaging toa young poet
“College Verse"
should be looked upon as a workshop.
not a polished display window, for
college poets. Whether we write or
criticize or do both, it is with this
same conception.
