Christmas break. The group visited a

Phonathon rakes in cash for annual fund

By Chris Maag

The second part of the tenth an-
nual alumni phonatlton ended Febru-
ary 12,raising3101,200 so farfor the
general funds The Alumni Programs
office estimates that this year's
phonathon will end up generating
aroundaquner ofamillion dollars by
the end of the ﬁscal year.

The February fundraiser cost
around $3700 in phonebills,andfood
for successful] callers. It used twenty
phone lines and 59 student callers,
andhadmaximum individual pledges
of $500 each.

“As far as the money we brought
in, our phone pledge total went down

a bit compared to other years," said
Marsha Coestner, Director of the
Annual Fund. “Bull think in the end
we’ll have more money given be-
cause people are using answering
machines more and more. Where be-
fore we would have gotten no answer,
now we will send pledge forms to
those people who have answering
machines and that will make up the
difference."

This means that the ﬁnal rally for
this year‘s phonathon isn’tin yet be»
cause some of the contributors have
not yet informed the college that they
intend to donate.

The donors can restrict their dona-
tions to any cause on campus. like the

library or sports teams. This restric»
tion is noted by a blank on the form
the student callers fill out. Alumni
services then tries to honor all the
requestsinstead of dumping theminto
the general annual fund.

At many other schools, adhering
to the donors requests is not a major
concern. The money the contributor
gives is put into the budget of that
speciﬁc depanment, but an equiva
lent amountis then taken back outof
the budget by the school and putback
into the general fund.

“We’re in a very lucky position
because the restricted donations we
get are true budget enhancers for the
individual departments - thev're not

immediately given back to the entire
college,” said Coestner. ‘

The student callers are given 810 _
for working a one night session, are
given a free tenrminule phone call to
anywhere in the U.S., and can win
calendars, T’snins and gift certiﬁ-
cates to J D's

“It's a good experience. Most of »
the people we talk to seem pretty ,
happy to hear from us, and only a few
people get upset when we call,” said .
Howard Gardos, a senior who has ,
worked for the phonathon each of his
four years.

The office of Alumni Affairs will
pay a total ofSl 8,000 this year to run
the phonathons.
