Three Firs’rs

Give Pioneers
League Ti’rle

Appleton, Wis. The
Grinnell college swimming
team rounded off its best
season in the history of the
sport by winning the Mills
west conference meet.

Grinnoll needed at least a sec-
ond place in the last relay to
win its fourth conference cham-
pionship in five years. The mer-
men, finishing in real champion
ship for-in, won the final event
with a time of 3:592. The only
team close to the Pioneers go-
ing into the last event was
Knox, last year's defending
champions. It was Knox that
beat out the Pioneers last year
by winning the last event.

Grinnell won three first
Illness in the meet. Bill Mur-
ray, sophomore mainstay, won
the 220 yard freestyle event
with a. time of 2:24. In win-
ning the event Murray aveng-
ed a loss the previous week at
Cornell. Grinnell’s other indi-
vidual winner was Dick Bres-
mhall, who Wm: the 100 yard
freestyle by swimming the
race in 56.2. Brmahm was a
constant winner in both Sprint
events throughout the season.
Coach Irv Simone did not
swim Bresmhm in the so yard
event in order to use hint in
(both of the relays. Sirnone’s

’ winning relay team) was made
up of Jim Jacobson, Jon
Walker, Bresnahan, and Bill

Only one Grinnell swimmer
set a conference record. Co-cap-
tain Jacobson set a new record
in the 200 yard individual med—
ley. “Big Jake” swam the event
in the preliminaries on Friday
afternoon in 230.7. The only
setback came Saturday when
Doug Murray beat Jacobson and
set a new record in turning in
the feat. Murray’s time was
2:254,

Bob Probesting of Knox set
a new conference record in the
50 yard freestyle with a time of
23.4. This is two-tenths of a sec-
ond off the record set by Grin-1
hell’s Joel Slubbs in 1956. The
other record was set 57 Mike‘
Lepawsky of lawrence m the
200 yard breaststroke. Lepaw-
sky's time was 2:373, and it was
the second straight year that
Lepawslcy won that event.

There were several surprises
in the big meet as are not
unusual .when the .M‘mfﬂence
chmplmship is at stake. The
first came to Grlnnell when
Knox won the first relay.
Grinnell set a. p00] and vars-
ity record in the 400 yard
Mley relay in a dual meet
against St. Olaf with a tlmc of
4:105. Throughout the season
the only team. to come close
to Grinnell’s time was Law-
rence, which ﬁnished fourth
Coach Simone said, “The boys
swam a good race, but when
rrolnsting swam a :56.4 loll
yard dolphin leg it was ton
hard to We up the differ-
ence. Knox only managed to
men out Brﬁmﬂmn as it
was"

Art Johnson was also nosed
out in the ZOO yard backstroke.
He finished second to Bjomson
of Lawrence. Johnson had had
trouble all season long with the

 

 

Jerry Cooke, Gl’lrmell, prepares to “Switch out" on his Knox
opponent, Troutman, in the 123 lb. ﬁnal match. Cooke succeeded
in the switch and went on to pin his opponent. Grinnell took fifth
place in the meet when Van Amooy and Wilkerson took seconds
and Roy Simpson took a fourth to add to Cooke’s first plaoe points.

25 yard pool, and this Just
might have been the reason.
“Then, too", said Simone, “Bjorn-
son probably swam the beat
race of his career.” it was
another case of winning a race
by the length of a hand,

The diving event on Friday
evening offered a lot of excite-
ment. The event was won by
Murphy of Lawrence with 183.6
points. A real surprise came to
Carleton when last year’s run-
ner—up failed to even place.
Grinnell's Jack Shaffer came
through for the Pioneers with
form good enough for fifth

place. The third, fourth andﬂfth
places were all separated by not
more than ten points.

The meet soorc was Crinnell
59, Knox 50, Carleton 30, Law-
rence 24, Cornell 23, St. Olaf

competition. The season record
was 9-2, losing only to the Air
Force academy and Gustavus

Textbooks Aren’t Rabbits—

 

—so we don’t have an end-
less supply of them. Natu-
rally we can get enough to
supply every student, but
frequently we have to order
books before we have ac-
curate class enrollment ﬁg-
ures. Sometimes we under-
estimate tlle popularity of a
course (we're human, tool),
and the only rule we can ap-
ply is a democratic one, “first
come, ﬁrst served".

So come to the store early,
when we can give you the
very best possible service.
And if you're disappointed
because we don't have one of
the books you need, rest as-
sured that the publishers are
staying up late these nights
to service our orders. We'll
get them for you as soon as
possible.

We do believe that you

should own your own books,

'for they are the basic tools

of learning. Without them
you will be like a carpenter

Cornell, Carls Pace Conference;
Pioneers Move To Fifth Slot

The Cornell college wrestlers
took home the Midwest confer—
ence wrestling championship
again last week for the 16th
time in the last 17 years. Its
string of 15 victories had been
broken last year by Carleton.

The Pioneer wrestlers, go-
ing into the conference meet
with a one win and eight de-
feats record, emerged from
the weekend of grappling at
Carleton in fifth place and
with a conference champ at
the 123 weight. Jerry Cooke,

Grinnell’s tough little 123
pound champ, paoed the Pio—
neer matmen with the aid of
Dave Van Anrooy, Bruce
Wilkerson and Roy Simpson.

Van Anrooy and Wilkerson,
at 177 and heavyweight respec-

tively, collected second places in ‘

Knox, 43; st. oxai, as; Grim
nell's rapidly improving 157
pounder took a fourth place to
round out Grinnell’s score.

Cornell was seemingly out
for revenge as it recaptured
the conference title by almost
doubling the score of second
place Carleton. Cornell amas-
sed 92 points; Carleton, 53;
Knox, 43; St. Olaf, 35; Grin-
nell, 24; Coe, 18; Lawrence, 3;
Monmouth, 3 and hipon, 2.

Cornell took six of the nine
first places while Grinnell, Carle-
ton and St. Olaf split the re-
maining three. All at the Grin-
nell wrestlers who competed in
the meet were either sophomores

 

or Juniors and will be back next

year with a season’s experience
under their belts.
