Let's not lie, throughout the week we diiiik coffee by
the gallons, not because we’re connoisseurs. but because it's
a life source. we drink coffee for all sorts of reasons, to
keep awake while writing that term paper, to have a reason
to meet that frieiici you don’t often see, and of course, to
cure the occasional, oppressive weekend hangover.

Throughout the last week, we frequented and pur-
chased coffee at the following Grinnell establishments;
A&M, Kum be Go, Bob's Underground Cafe, Saints Rest,
and Grinnell Coffee Company with the hopes of discover-
ing the coffee joint for any occasion. In order to be fair,
we sampled the house cup at eachjoinr, one black and one
with the works (whatever creative cream and sugar cone
coction they offered) in order to provide you with the full
experience,

Saints Rest

Our first stop on the coffee roar was Saints Rest,
the coffee establishment generally most familiar to
Gri nell students. Determined to convey our reactions
to the experience, we tracked our emotions via smiley
face drawings and are pleased to announce that our
faces, saddened by the rainy weather and the looming
Monday before us, turned right side up,

Despite the dreary weather, the environ was filled
with cheery staff, local artwork, warm lighting, and the
curious conversation from a posse of ten—year-olds sir-
ting at the table nearby. we left the shop with higher
spirits, it offers a nice break from campus, an opportu-
nity to mingle with town residents, and an excuse to sit
at the window and shamelessly people watch. Although,
seein children on leashes is rnildi disheartenin.

Grinnell Coffee Company

Grinnell Coffee Company, the shop immediately follow
ing out stop at saints Rest. proved a signiﬁcant departtirc
from the homey and hustling saints Rest. The coffeehouse
was larger and darker than the main room at Saints Rest,
seeming to purposefully take a more urban, hippcr approach.
Its subdued lighting and soorhing_ a music provides the
college student with the right atinosplicrc for studying for
semester ﬁnalsithat and they offer bottomless cups ofcof»
fee, a perk for the perpetually penniless college studenl.Th:
_ it has two blends ofcoffce available daily,which are roast»
ed on location, as well as the typical selection of specialty
drinks and sandwiches.

Bob’s Underground Cafe

we meandered on over to the overeaccessible and cone
venient Bob’s Undergroniid Cafe where snidents occupied
almost every tablet Some scribbled notes for their classes,
others engaged in lively conversation, a few were even passed
out on the sofas. The coffee hit the spot—it was strong.
plentiful. and served out ofa random coffee mugs, in true
crinneu fashion. You can even pay for it with your p-card.
granted you havent blown all your campus cash on piles of
dirty laundry. Bob’s is the place to go ifyou want to kill two
birds with one stone and knock out that homework while
meeting your oheman -need-to-stop-doing-homeworke
and-start-inaldngehumaneconversation quota.

Kum & Go

The infamous Kum 8c Go, a convenience store that
shows up on both the food and gas signs along Interstateeso,
offered us a chance to satisfy our substance cravings in the
simplest and cheapest of ways. A 12 oz. coffee was rnodcre
ately priced at $1.19, and, Wllh the help ofa hevy ofcreame
ers, syrups and questionable caffeine additives, all available
at no extra charge, the coffee tasted like, well, whatever you
put in it, However, with the presence ofburritos. nachos and
hot dogs, the coffee was a secondary concern.The small shop
was filled with conversation and a certain biisk happiness,
surprising for a chain gas station. For those who are look-
ing for a quick pick meeup, oi a stoinachache, try the Km
at Go Strikeout—a drag or a cigarette, followed by a bite
of a ste- k . rid cheese burrito, all washed down by scalding
“Coliiinbiari”coffec,

Although it’s customary for students to vi t AstM dure
ing a rough weekend, after vi ig on a Wednesday afternoon,
we suggest that you don’t write it off during the week. The
seating was instantaneous. the usually slow service was snappy
and the portions seemed larger Also, the coffee, as always, was
endless.

Although it tasted like your typical Folgtr’s drip, the end~
less refills that were always a waitress away made it worth the
tnste.The price for coffee was typical, but the food’s still cheap,
such as the face eed sz cinnamon roll. Look out for the non-
dairy powdered creamer—it contains Inﬂkﬂnd don’t even
think about asking for a latter This is, of couise, AseM.
