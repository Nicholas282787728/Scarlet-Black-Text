ninth-MURAL FOOTBALL.

Welcon scarcely. pass over the loot-
hnii craze that is sweeping the dormi-
tories at the present lime
comment. Frequently, as many as:
three huilding teams can he seen in
action on‘the dormitory green. at the
some time. all trying to recall the'

Without

rudiments of the game; as learned in
high school rediscovering
several score oi muscles that have

and all‘

laininarticulate since their last ses—
sion of the pigskin.

One dormitory, we are told, became
so enthused over its football pros-‘
seats that all night! signal practice‘
was held in the cluhroom, a‘heztn has
supplanting the conventional spher»=
old.

The revival ot intra—mural ioothall
has certainly its ludicrous side, yet it‘
has other aspects of a very dilierent'
nature. -

Because Of the highly developed
competition in inter—collegiate athlet—l
ice, and especially in inter—collegiate
ioothhil. its emphasis must necessarily
be placed on the lew and not on the
many.

intro—mural competition gives tlvel
times as many men an opportunity to'
take part in athletics as does varsityl
competition; One reason that can be
advanced in‘ its favor is' that it tur—
nishes vigorous exercise and lnlmlcas
hie pleasure to o. much larger number
or men than varsity athletics can do.-

Th’m is yet another word to he.
said in favor of intersdorm athletics.
The fraternity issue in Grlnnell is as
dead as the: slavery issue in the na-
tion. Yet we can not deny that the‘
group loyalty which lrzternlties de—
Melon. as long as it does not allow the
tree to overshadow the iorest.
very desirable element in college lite.

isa

Those who planned Grinnell realized
this, for thsy have given us the dorJ
mltories to serve as our college home.
and arranged them so that each group
oi thirty or iorty, men constitutes one
integral division of the whole. Yet
mere division is not enough to engena
der building loyalty and friendly coup

lpetitiou.
Loyalty is an active quality; it pre—
supposes some active outlet.
intramural athletics iurnishcs one
or the host outlets tor this group loin
city that could he round. it should
llclp to develop .1. friendly rivalry and
a spirit' of loyalty among the man’s
polls that can not help hut react to
the heneiit oi Grinnell as a whole.
There m‘elthosc who oppose intrIIr
mural ioothali as dangerous. Men who
are out oi training may have to com-
pete with those who are in training
and can play a much harder game.
That point is. well talren, hut the
ioct that men out for varsity or fresh-
.man football are ineligible for int“.—
mural Competition eliminates to a.
great extent the danger due to Im—
equalities of physical condition.
Football, hecause it can he -moru
dangerous, is not so well ﬁtted to
intramural competition as other
sports, yet with the personnel of the
teams’ limited to those Who are not
engaging in varsity or ireshman fool.-
hail, with same management, and with
a common seucc‘ attitude on the part
oi the players, the gridiron sport
should become a relatively sole,
though perhaps imperlcct 'form of
inter—hoilding competition.

A STEP FORWARD ,

A measure recently adopted by the
Dramatic council requires that every

 

organization planning to stage a. play,
shall almost! the Illity to be presented
within a. Specified time before the
date of production, or forfeit the date.
All full length productions, under this
regulation, must be selected ill. least
six weeks prior to the time of pres-
entation. Bills of one act plays must
be selected at least four weeks in aid-
Vance of the production dates.

To anyone who is looking for some-
thing to criticize, this notion on the
part of the council may seem to bet
rather arbitrary and dogmatic.

To anyone who is openrminded, this
action will appeal- to he merely an at—‘
tempt on the part of the council to
insure adequate time for casting and
rehearsals.

To anyone who has gone through
the trying experience of high pressure
in
play or cast, last minute preparation

rehearsal, eleventh hour change

‘eissets and properties, this regulation

or the council'will appear as a necess-
ity to well managed dramatics.

thing that need not he done today. Al»
though this procrastinaﬁon has not
been lam to our campus dramtics,
no one call deny that hurl-led prepar-
ations have often impaired produce

ly the generosity of the audience or
some other {elicitous circumstance
alone has smvcd off the disaster that
inaddquate preparation had prepared.
To raise the general level of cam—
pus dramatics by insuring adequate
time for Casting, rehearsing, and the
preparation of sets, prbpei‘lies and the
multitude of other things that go to

It was with the greatest reluctance
that Professor Trumhztuel‘ divulged
any or the salient iacts of his lile his-
Lory. What could be pried from him
includes: that he was born in Phila-
dclpliia. and with the exeception of
six years in Pittshur has spent
most oi his lite there.

His “uneventful existence” includes

a B. s., an A. M., and a Ph. D., all
from the university oi pennsylvonla.
He has taught the history of the
distinct at the University of Pennsylvar
pic, at Swarthmore, and at Carnegie
Institute. At one time Mr. Trum-
hauer was teaching, studying, and
carrying a ion—inspector oi the Board
oiZ Health.
l Practical experience in acting,‘
managing, and directing, as well as
study of the various phases ot dra-‘
matic composition and prodllcﬁon,‘
have filled Mr. Trumbduel‘ for the
construction of the six plays which
find their name directly“ beneath their
titles. His work includes a religious
drama or the Amish sect, mood play,
a farce, a dramatization of one oi
Bulzetc’s sterics, and a tragic war
play.

Mr. Trulnbauel‘ announces that his
method oi production is eclectic; that
he is not in sympathy with pseudo-
reaiism. ultrn-natralism, or extreme
impressionlsm; but don‘t excite your—
self, he’s also human—he owns a
Ford. .
