It’s rriday afternoon.
Your meal plan ran out
for the week at lunch.
your roommate ate your
last candy bar from
Southern, and your
mother doesn't love you
enough to send you a
care package. You could
walk downtown and buy
some food, but you
spent all your money on
the Zeppelin Box Set
and a used car that you
can't afford to put gas
in.

ihis weekend, you will
be a forager.

in he a successful
food scavenger, you will
need a Campus Memo,
Virtually every speaker
listed will be backed up
by a myriad of cookies
(of the sugar, peanut
butter, and chocolate
chip variety) and
beverages (like iced tea,
coffee, lemonade, and
not cider). the catch
here is that you have to
stay and listen to the
speaker. Most of the
time the talk will be
interesting. but
sometimes it is under
researched, biased, or
trite (or you finished
eating all of the
gingetsnaps). 1f the
speaker or subject is
bad, look at your watch
and furrow your brow

(Averal times. Then run.
Also look for any

opening or closing
ceremonies. ihese
classier but harder-tu-
corne-by events may
serve chocolate. fruit, or
chocolateccovered fruit.
However, the
competition for food at
these events is fierce.

1 also recommend
selling your laundry
chips or exploring your
futon for change. If
you can come up with
50 cents, catth the
cheap popcorn before
the movie at Harris.

for more beverages, a
good place to look is
MathLAN. ihis
computer Lab is not only
the breeding ground for
comp-sci majors, but it
also is has the highest
concentration of
caffeine on campus, and
perhaps in the
wholewideworld. Just
be careful not to
overdose on Surge or
talk to the natives.

To end your night of
scrounging, hit the
harris party. ihere is
usually a table of snacks
that no one touches.
Take advantage of these
untapped supplies of
thex Mix and cheetos.

And remember, you
can hold extra stores in
your cheeks for
Saturday

Erin Brockovich and Rear Window to play at Harris this weekend

By Fred Beukemo and
Aaron Siockhom
Columnists

A: Holy cow. They‘ve done it this
time. SGA Films, the Harris Ccnrcr
projectionisrs and stal-‘fhavc really done
it. They actually made it through an
entire weekend without any major foul
ups. 1 think 1'vc soon just about every.
thing now. Although, as a
reprieve, 1 didn't go to
Friday's film, giving the staff
a one-night break. Let me
be the ﬁrst to congratulate
the fine members of those
distinguished bodies. Let's
go for two in a row, now

Erin Brockovich

F: Julia Roberts stats in
this "true story" film about
a single mom (the titular
Brockoylch) who, through
her work as a secretary in a
small law firm, uncovers a
company's shady dealings in
a rural California community.

A: You get points for conclscness,
Fred. Okay, I think cvcryonc agrees
with me that Prat}! Woman is Julia's best
work, right? And every vehicle she stars
in is just a poor attempt at Jules trying
to get the magic back This fall: into
that category perfectly. She flashes that
”millioncwatt smile” and we’re all sup-
posed to believe she's worth $15 mils
lion per film. Sell it somewhere else,
because I’m not buying. 1 think the only
reason anyone saw this film was because

Julia Roberts was in it, which doesn’t
say much for the movie itself.

P; But the ﬁlm does have a good
story going for it, and unlike other rcv
cent “True stories” (i.e. rbc Harri-cunt.
Tric Insider), the makers haven't had
major claims against the facts ofthc nar-
rative. But that alone doesn't make for
entertainment. The characters are

pretty realistic, and
the writers didn’t feel
the need to make the
lovc subplot a big sex
scene. They focus
more an Erin’s fearxof
another man drape
ping her for some.
thing bettcr, and how
the guy (Aaron
Eckhart) doesn’t onyoy
playing second fiddle
to her job,

A: The only rca.
son no claims about
the movie's facts have
been made is becausc.

unlike the two previously mentioned
films, nobody has ever heard of Erin
Brockovich. For all i knew, she was
spidorman's archnemesis. 1 just left thc
thoaror fooling kind ofbctraycd because
the previews made it our ro be better
than it was. And 1 hate that.

F: 1 liked the fact that an individual
managed to dig up thisdirr abouta big
corporation knowingly hurting families
(which happens more than it gets dis»
covcrcd) and was able to do something
about it. Plus, stcvcn sodcrbcrgh plays

around with handheld cameras (as he
did in Out ofxig/ir and Tire Linicy),
which gives it a cool documentary feel.

Fred's final verdict an obvious cop.
out: is out of 10.

Number ofTimes Aaron Has Paid
to see this Film _ an obvious reflection
of the quality: Once, because 1 love
Julia’s “millioncwarr smile"

Rear Window

F: This is tl’lE bcst
movie you will see at
Harris this year. It'sa
restored releas: of the
Hitchcock original, in
which photographer.
in.traction Jimmy
Stewart watches his
neighbors in the
cournyard ofhis apart.
mcnt building. He
thinks he has wir»
“ﬁxed a murdcr, and cnllsr: his detec-
live friend and socialite ﬁanccc (Grace
Kelly, later princess of Monaco) to help
investigate.

A: Ifyou’ve never seen a Hitchcock
film before, this is a great one to start
with. It’s got all of the necessary elcc
merits — sweet plot, great photography,
the classic Hitchcock blondc, and er;
cnding that hinges on fashion. All of
these are textbook Hitchcock, placing
this ﬁlm in my top five list. 1t's just
that good. 1 really can’t think of one
aspect that’s not perfectly done. 1'm
running our otsupcrlatives. Fred, stop
me.

pulled in. 1 felt powerless, forinsrancc,
when Kelly wentacross to the neighbor's
apartment, and the guy starts coming
back, and there's
nothingstcwarr (or
1) could do to warn
her.

A: Hitchcock‘s

Vzrtiga (on DVD!) and Rope.

I'vc rcnrcd it about five times, which
equals about two theater visits. but it
probably deserves more.
