Jude Law
sizzles (twice)
while Denzel
fizzles

Screwball humor abounds
in anexistential comedy
while Jude Law woos the
ladies into his bed and
Denzel Washington vows to
save the little girl from big
bad kidnappers. But just
stare at Jude Law and
everything will be fine.

Alﬁe (R)

Alfie is a Commentary on the evil ways
of the male gender. but somehow makes us
like the shameless adulteicr, here played by
Jude Law in the title role. Law is a seductive
bachelor who uses his easy charm and tallc
ingrmrrhercnmcm monologues to seduce the
audience as much as the countless women he
brings to bed.

And bring them to bed he does. Alfie is
looking for a woman who will make no de
mands and completely understand his need
to be unfaithful (I'm dubious about whether
or not this woman actually existsl In true he
dies man spirit. he loves and leaves a string of
women: a neglected wife (Jane Krakowski), a
successful businesswoman who is just as no-
nonsense about sex as she is
about her job (an excellent
Susan Sarandon) and Nikki
(Sienna Miller), a beautiful
model with a dependency on
mood stabilizers.

And then there is Jur
lie (Marisa Tomei), a single
mother who refuses to share
Alfie and is the only woman
for whom he actually cares.
Omar Epps. whosc body
makes any movie worth set-e
mg, also makes in appearance
as the best friend. (I thought
i might as ivcll join Allic and
shamelessly objectify the op
posite sex).

The remake of the 1966
original is less weighty and
ultimately funnier. in no
small part because of shifts
lug gender roles. No longer is
the older woman (Sarandon)

with another man and int
quires what he has that Alfie
doesn’t, she promptly answers:
“Hc‘s younger than you."And
no longer is the smitten sins

the woman having a child out
ofwedlock shamed into hav-
ing an abortion.

The rules are different than they were in
the 19605, and this film is less about social
commentary and more about relationships. as
at turns funny, sweet, sad, and annoying. And
although Law has himself, and the audience,
thoroughly convinced that being a heartbreak
ing sex machine isn't all that bad, he discovers
that life in the single lane can be rather lonely.

mean havmg a cameo by Ben Stiller, Screwball
is truly zany stuff, like giving Katherine Hepr
burn a petjaguai, or having a woman not fall in
love with Cary Grant just at the sight or him.
Though screwball is entertaining, it doesn't
usually make sense,which led to its decline.

Enter I {He/17‘!) Huck-
abce’r, which tries to make
sense out of the absurd.
(The title uses the heart
symbol. here denoted by
parentheses.) It certainly
has a plot that’s tough to
ﬁgure out. Albert (Jason
Schwartzman), an envii'oir
mental acnvrst who writes
awful pot y, is suffering
from various maladies, real
and imaginary. so he sc
out a pair of“cxistential (ic—
tcctives” (Lily Tomlin and
Dustin Holtman), who are

pseudorphllosophcrs.

As I said, none ofthis makes much sense.
But that doesn't mean that it’s not funny or
insightful. Writer/director David 0, Russell,
who last crafted the sublime Gulf War come

problem of screwball with existentialism. If
there is no predeﬁned human nature, any pose

abce’s script, all of the acting performances,
especially Tomlin and Hoffman, are fresh and
enjoyable, and are buoyed by a great score by
Jon Brion. 1 (Heart) Huckabee's is a startling
interpretation of screwball, and is a splendid
film for those who want deep thoughts to pork
der alongside their laughs.

an on Fire (R)

A lot of action movies have assassins, kid-
nappings, a hero with a mysterious past, and
lame moral conﬂicts. But thm on Fire has
Denzel Washington. Washington plays a for
mcr US. CIA assassin in this action film and
his character, Ci-casy. bccotncs a bodyguard in
M ico where, acoolding to the movie, some
one is kidnapped e ~ry 90 minutes. crersys
charge , a little girl named l’ita (Dakota Fan-
nillg) who wants to be friends with Ci-easy,
but he says that he is her bodyguard, not her

friend.

However, the tough guy exterior cracks
and their relationship becomes sweet and
somewhat unbelievable And when the inevir
table happens and she is kidnapped, Creasy, of
course, vows to save her. As he works tirelessly
to ﬁnd his small triciid, creasy turns to nu-
merous characters for help and it seems as if
the whole city is exerting energy to find Pita.

The beginning of the film shows prom—
ise of being more than “just an action movie,”
but quickly devolves into mOrlong action se-
quences. It seems as if the beginning is just a
moral pretext fol an enormous bloodbath. It’s a
shame. because Washington's character is com-
plex and sympathetic enough to deserve more
than these prototype scene57he lamentably
trades in his emotional depth for sliotgur Ie
does do a passable job with what little script is
there, and Fanning is endearing and remark
ably talented tor a lO-ycal-old. The movie
borders on vacuoris, but it is a run lilm ri‘yorr’rr»
in the mood for an action movie.
