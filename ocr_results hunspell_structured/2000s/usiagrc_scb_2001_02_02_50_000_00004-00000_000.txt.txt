Au Fait

by Sarah Aswell
Arls Editor

People who say
that they don't like
reality TV are the very
same people who claim
that they don't pick
their nose or slow the
car down to look at
accident scenes, They
say, ”I have no interest
in that Survivor trash"
right before they say ”I
don’t use cheater chips
to do my laundry" and
right after they say
"porn is gross."

I watch reality
television. It's free of
cardboard characters,
bad scripts, laugh
tracks, and unlikely
plot lines where
teenaged girls
inadvertently invite
three people to prom
creating hilarious
situations that
somehow end in a
important lesson about
the dangers of drug
use. Reality TV goes
back to the basics
which is more of a
situational comedy: a
middle-class family
dealing with daily life
or 16 strangers trapped
on an island without
food or shelter? Think
about it.

What makes the
Show Survivor
particularly
unstoppable is that it
plays on a strange
democratic fantasy:
that the popular vote

can systematically
banish weak,
unattractive or socially
awkward members of
the groups That and
the chicks wear bikinis
all the time. But can
you imagine the world
of television where
your least favorite
characters were slowly
and deliberately picked
off? Do you realize
how much cooler ”Full
House" would have
been? John Stamos
could have been off
the air in eight days
instead of eight years.
Not to mention that
Pacey could have
totally gotten rid of
Dawson by now.

You might be
thinking, "No, Sarah,
even with all of that
said, [still think
reality television is
merely a way forThe
Man to take advantage
of bland people like
you who want to live
vicariously though
others. Plus, I found
John Stamos
attractive." Or you
might be thinking, "I
really don’t pick my
nose, you know, unless
it’s an emergency or
I’m bored,“ Either way,
I'd say you’re voted off
the island, if you know
what I meant
