on Wedneday night, Konstanty Gebert,
Religious Studies, drew the line at Ariel Shr»
ron eating Palestinian children for breakfast

It was just one of many lines drawn and
redrawn at “Caricature and Context,"a faculty
panel organized by m Sal/iii, Grinnell Multi-
cultural Alliance and Muslim Student Assor
cialion to address the place of Visual political
commentary in society, an issue raised by the
Danish cartoon controversy Gebert, Shuclti
Kapila, English, and John Chaimov, a German
professor at Coe college, spo

Originally published by a Danish newspa-
per, the cartoon depicts Muhammad wearing
a bomb in his turbani The cartoon incensed
Muslims and nonrMusl‘rms around the globe.
TIM Sal/1d reprinted the cartoon alongside an
editorial addressing the original printing.

“These [Danish] political cartoons were
drawn to elicit a speciﬁc reaction: outrage,"

Salad, said,

“We need a space where we can have ﬁm,
where political cartoons are acceptable," Kapila
said “This decline in humor and satire needs
to be dealt with seriously."

Kapila felt the cartoon was published
in “bad faith.” “The main problem with the
Muslim cartoon is that it was intended for an
innhouse audience ofsecular liberals,"she said.
“The cartoon was not trying to include the
community in the conversation, it was trying
to exclude ' ’

Gebett said he was troubled that Muslims
angered by t s cartoon did not react in the
same way to anti-Semitic cartoonsut's a pills
7.1e for me that the same people, Muslims in
Europe, expect outrage at insults against them,
but keep quiet where insults are committed in
their name,"lte sa ."It’s a fundamental moral
pr' iciplc [that I would be] more angry at
th being committed in my name than at me.
This silence, to me, is stunning.”

Kapila felt that sensit ity to the history of
religions symbols should be taken into account
when using cartoons to lampoon, and Geheit
said that the strong international reaction to
the cartoons reﬂected a difference in how dif—
fereiir societies value these religious synihols.

“This is a clash between a civilization that
has lost a taboo reeling about the symbols of
its religion, and those that haven’t," he said,
noting that mostly Christian Euiope does not
have the same reverence rm religious symbols
that Aral: countries do for Muslim symbols.

“There are no offensive untlsChtistlttn car-
toons, not because [people] are afraid of the
Christian reaction, but because no one would
notice or care,” he aid. “VVitlt no Muslims in
Europe as potential readers and voters, there
would have been no Muhammad cartoon."

Fardous Bahdouh '06, a Muslim strident
from Syria, said that she would have reacted
differently to the cartoon had it depicted Osa—
ma bin Laden, instead of Muhammad, “bin

Laden is not representative of Islam. He is the
extremist part who kills other people, so we
need to distinguish between what is religious
and what is political,” she said. “Muhammad
was a person who led a nation from violence
and ignorance to a great civilization. There
are 1.5 billion people around world who all
consider themselves followers to him, and this
cartoon is showing Muhammad as a terrorist,
there rs an association between terrorism and
Muslims, and in a time where all people are
ﬁghting, it could lead to discrimination and
violence against Muslims."

Alvin Irby ’07, who attended the panel
discussion, said that while the cartoon was ofr
fens‘tve, he understood the need {or political
caricature and satire in society “Was it right
or was it wrong to print it, who am I to say?”
he said. “Vi/hat I can say is that [77]: S/Ilrltl’l]
reprinting resulted in constructive discussion
that brought people to the same table to discuss
issues that may have never been discussed."
