Converted skeptic

“My intellectual belief that Jesus was who he said he was led
me to a belief in God," said Gordon Pearce. “[That's] because no
one else could have orchestrated a registration. I think that for
most Christians, it seems to be the other way around." Pearce,
who is the author of From Skeptic f0 Clarirziml,,visitcd campus
on Tuesday for a talk in which he outlined what he said was the
historical evidence forjesus. A standing-room only crowd came
to listen to Pearce at the South Lounge in an event sponsored
by the Grinncll Collcgc Ch an Fellowship.

[I found that] wherever the Gospels make a factual statement
there' is evidence to back it up. If you ve got. a lot of evidence for

that is irrelevant to the truth of Gospel accounts. Jesus’ divinity
doesn’t depend on anything people do in his name.

Continuing discussion

Open forum held on Monday about self-governance and police on campus

By SARAH MIRK

on Monday, April 11, a panel of
college administrators faced questions
from a crowd gathered in the Forum
North Lounge for an open forum on
self-governance. The forum, organized
by SGA president Mark Henry‘OS, to-
cused on recent events involving police
on campus.

The panel included those Henry
considered "most knowledgeable" about
these topics: Director of Campus Secur
rlty Stephen Briscoe, Vice President for
Student Services Tom Crady, President
Russcll Osgood, Dean for Student Life
Jen Krohn, Assistant District Attorney
Becky Petig ‘97 and Grinnell Police
Chicfjody Matrherly.

“It was a good crew to have,” Henry
remarked as audience and panelists filed
out of the Forum an hour and 40 “HIV
utes after the panel began. “Students
understood that people are not allowed

to talk about some things, but people
got pretty direct responses."

“I don’t agree with everything that
was said," said Mark Gardiner ‘05, “but
it was good to have them here saying
it,”

An 359’}? reporter asked about the
apparent increase in arrests of students
for drugrrelated instead of onrcampus
disciplinary aenon, as seen by the 20017
2003 crime statistics on Security’s web-
site._

Crady answered that the difference
was in what the police did with the
information once they received it, not

a change in campus policy Matherly, .

who has served as chief for two years,
agreed that the police have been more
likely to take action on complaints 16’
ceivcd in recent years. He also said the
increase in more dangerous drugs as
being a cause for more arrests,
I-lowever, Crady said that what

crimes a Security officer decides to
report is a “judgment call.” In recent
cases, such as marijuana being sent in
the mail, the crimes have been “blatant"
and Crady stressed that “we cannot
walk away" from such incidents. “If you
really want consistency, it will ultimater
ly be more restrictive,” he said.

The recent arrest of Paul Wainright
‘07 for a Plan posting brought up thc
issue of free speech on campus. “At
GrinnellI have been taught to push the
limits of free speech,” said Adam Roth-
stein ‘05, "And now I'm worried that if
1 push those limits, l will wind up with
a felony."

In response, Osgood asserted that
the school is “totally, completely dedi-
cated to free speech in an academic
setting” but cannot keep the law from
interfering. “What you're unhappy with
is the state of the law," he said.

“I know my children.,. will never
know a world without the Americans
With Disabilities Act," said Peter
Blanck, Director of the Law, Health
Policy and Disability Ccnter at the
University of Iowa College of Law.
An Adrhoc Committee on Issues of
Disability invited
Blanck to Grinnell
on Tuesday through

gram.

In his presenta-
tion, “Americans with
Disabilities andTheir
Civil Rights," Blanck
discussed the Americans With Dis—
abilities Act (ADA) enacted 15 years
ago. The ADA has “goals that underlie
our children’s right to a free and inde
pendent society," he said. He described
disability rights cases he has argued, in-
cluding supreme Court cases. “Despite
progress to ADA implementation, we
have a supreme Court which has crer
ated a strong backlash to disability is—
sues," he said.

Blanck talked about “social, ec0r

”/ know my children... wr/l never

nomic and attitudinal forces which can
foster or hinder"ADA implementation.
He talked about univeisities, employ-
ers and media sources discriminating
against people wirh disabilities, includ
ing lawsuits against Chuck E Cheese
and Boston University, where students
with disabilities sued the university for
accommodations
and curriculum,

Blanck der
scribed people with
disabilities as an
oppressed group.
“subject to slower
types and stigma
in housing,health-
care and education." He described the
historical relationship between racism
and ablerbotliedism, citing studies of
social stigma toward disabled veterans,
“The stigma whammy was double for
African American veterans," he said.
This stigma could have “life and death
consequences," said Blanck.

The event included an American
Sign Language interpreter and a pro-
jcction displaying the words ctBlanck’s
lecture as he spoke.

When 25 people showed up for a
“Book Rapport” session with feminist
author Amy Hollywood, the Burling
stairwas surprised, and had to bring in
extra chairs. They were even more sure
prised when those 25 people polished
oﬁ’ the supply of cookies and coffee
meant for 40.

Hollywood, a University of Chit
cago Divinity School professor, spoke
at Burling Library Tuesday night about
books that have inﬂuenced her “as a
woman, a student and a scliolar."Holly-
wood, who taught part ofa seminar on
modern feminist scholarship onrcamr
pus last fall, is one offour scholars back
on campus this week for the three-day
symposium “Currents in Contempo-
rary Feminist Scholarship,"

Hollywood cited an eclectic variety
of books as inﬂuential in her life, inc
eluding Lime I’Vnmim, Tb: Life lifebo—
lam Bran/2, and Friedrich Nietzsche‘s
071 2/}: Genealogy ochmlr. Hollywood
explained the diverse mix as her are
tempt to “finally, at age 40, bridge the
gap" between the religion and philoso—

 

phy books she reads academically and
the ﬁction and poetry she reads out
side her studies. “If you read academic
books while you're writing, yourwriting
stinks,” she said.

Phil Jones, reader services librarian,
said he oiganized the event to “allow
the scholar and student to relate to each
other in an informal setting."

"students are here anyway," Jones
said, adding that bringing visiting
speakers to a space where students
regularly go encourages a “proximity of
student and scholar.” Students relaxed
on chairs while snacking on cookies
and coffee during Hollywood's got
minute talk and discussion.

susnn Bol'do, a University of Kenv
lucky English and Women‘s Studies
professor, was unable to join the event
as scheduled, Bordo’s inﬂuential books
included works from Andrea Dworkin,
Pauline Kael, Germaine Greer and,like
Hollywood, Friedrich Nietzsche. Books
written and recommended by both vis-
iting scholars are presently on display
in Burling's lobby and are available for
checkout, said Jones.
