Trays
from p_ 1 Supervisor Lyle
Baumdn, one of the
primary obstacles to traylcss dining at
Grirrncll is the dining halls cleaning
infrastructure, Plates and cups placed
on the conveyor without a tray eventu—
ally fall off, “With the conveyor system
that we have, it will not handle just the
plates and glasses and so forth,“ Bane
man Silldt “So at this point and time
there’s no way that our facility would
be able to handle it."

Administrators could not say
whether or not tiayless dining is still a _
longsterm option. “Anyahing’s possible
but that would take some pretty major
renovations," Bauman said. “But today
it’s not veryf sible."

Eric Nost '09, a member of Free
the Planet, said because of the poten-
tial longtrerm benefits, Dining Ser»
vices should still consider the upfront
costs of outfitting the conveyor system
to accommodate just plates and cups.
“It may be possible that replacing the
dishroorn is a good idea," he said. “They may have to spend a
lor, but in the long run, they may be saving money."

Ultimately, Williams said, whether or not Grrnnell goes
trayless will be up to the snrdenrs. “Pelsonally, l heircve that
this needs to be student driven, certainlyl don't want anyone
saying ‘Dick said we should do thrs, so we willJIn the end, got
ing trayless isjust a personal decision, some students already do
it, and some students just use trays by themselves 1 think the

biggest challenge is to just get the
majority of students to accept tray~
less dining,"he said.

Students interviewed for this are
tiele were generally receptive to the
idea and believed that it would help
reduce waste and costs.

“I think that because there‘s a
tray right now, [students] are prob
ably going to be annoyed at it in
the beginning but it will help with
waste," said Concepcion de Leon
’12.“I get a few plates,l end up not
eating most ofit.I put it all on a tray
because 1 can and cnd up not eating
a lot of i ”

Shivani Santoki '11 said that
she found the tray a co enicncc in
transporting her meals I’m a little
clumsy so I would want my soup,
my hulk, salad and my actual food
on one tray with me because it’s
more convenient,” she said. Still,
she said that eliminating trays
would likely save food and should

be considered.

To ensure that the proposal is not forgotten, Nost said that
he hoped campus activists would continue to push for its imple’
mentntion. “I hope that FTP along with the Student Environs
mental Organization and Eco House will take up the initiative
to prrsh this tmyless drnrng rntrative for-nard and get the dining
committee seriously considering the option," he said.

Voting
from p. 1 than a teacher in Iowa.”

While some voters expressed cons
ccrn over specific policy issues at the local level, others, such as
Simone Sidwcll, a librntian at the Stewart Library, were 430an
parativcly uninformed which led them to vote prrruarily along
party lines. Im not as well infoimcd [about the local candis
dutcs]," Sidwell said. And I would say thats yust a product of
my own priorities and there rsnr that much iriforruanou about
them."

“On local races, Im more ufa parry voter, Sidwell said “I
try to do some general research but in dont know that much
about them, I ll generally justD ao tor the Democrat"

While not directly related” to public policies, interviewees
often spoke at length about Gtinnell College students voting
in local elections, which again elicited diversity of responses.
Unsurprrsingly, however, opinions about student voting seemed
to largely correspond to the persons apparent party affiliation.

Citing the transience of college students, Doug Allen,
President ofAJlen Financial in downtown Grinnell, said he felt
College students should vote absentee in their home elections.

“Most oftheni aren‘t going to have roots here, aren't going to be
here long term. some ofthcrn may leave, but they’ve voted for
someone who’s going to be in ofﬁce for more than a little bit,"
he said. “That's not fair to the general population that’s here.”

Jeff Phelps '71, owner of Saints Rest coffee shop, on the
other hand, said he felt college students are members of the
communrty and should vote, “You're here just as long as the
suowbirds are, the folks t at leave town in November and come
back in Aprrl," Phelps ."‘As I set it, )ou don’t live at home
anymore. why would it be more important for you to vote there
than here, As I sec it, this is your home."

While affirming the right or snrdents to vote, Elliot said
she hoped students would consider how candid-ates they vote
for affect the average Grinncll resident. “This is our place. And
who gets elected decides how much we pay in taxes, how much
we get and benefit from varrous government programs,” Elliot
said. “And I would just ask college students to think aborrr that
when they cast their votes for the more local elections that aft
feet my life on into the future after you guys graduate and go
elsewhere."
