Mental health
raises concerns

Two \VCcks ago, Erica Kuhlmann 08 circulated an open let-
ter around campus whi a shocked many snidents as it told the
forthright story or her struggles addressing her anorexia with
school administrators who evennially placed hel on involuntary
medical lcave.“l wanted people to be able to see what happened
to me and use their own judgment to decide whether or not
this was the way things rota/d happen, stud Kuhllnann, whose
mandatorv leave prof’npted letters and planlove and was ulnr
mately reversed after she met with administrators

In response to the student outcry about Kuhlltlauu's case,
the administration has said it will review the college's mental
health policies. “Because there are concerns among students, it
[mental health services] should be teviewed,"said Vice Pesident
ofstudent Services Tom Crady. “I don't think anybody has any
concern about reviewing it at all."

A reevaluation last occurred in
2003-2005, following several suicides
on carnpus.The current mixed reaction
from many students to mental health
services, however, may again push the
administration into making substantial
changes sooner than planned.

Since every student seeking help has her or his unique set
of issues, ambitions and history, it's difficult to pinpoint when
good or had personal experiences amount to a success or fails
tire of institutional policy. The college’s multitlayercd mental
health system is geared toward ﬂexible, personal treatment of
students unioue mental health issues: struggling students can
talk to peers (SAs),supporti\/e adults (RLCs) or head to protes-
sionals on campus at the Health Centers free walk-in appoint-
ments or offscampus at their eight free visits to the Poweshcik
country Mental Health Center.

These services are also heavily used. Last year students
made approximately 800 walk-in visits. “we’ve probably in-
creased out demand [for mental health services] by about 100
percent in the last five years," said Crady.

Kuhlman’s experience is at one end of a large spectrum of
students’ use of college mental health services. Some students
feel greatly helped by the care they receive while others, like
Kulhmann, feel left in the lurch. ““They [the college] are looking
out for our wellrbeing, they just don’t always make people who
need and want the help comfortable enough to go get it," said

Campus pub opening delayed

by CHRIS NEUBERT

Students hoping to spend their posttfall break semester
sharing drinks with professors in the JRC basement will have
to wait a little while longer. Despite initial hopes to have cont
struction completed on the new campus pub by this time, final
decisions continue to be debated while final construction Pm,
gresses with the goal of finishing by early next year.

While the pub, officially renamed Lyle’s, will probably not
open soon, Associate Dean and Pub Committee member Sher-
ee Andrews emphasized that progress was still moving forward.
“FM’s been working steadily,”shc said “But there are still sev»
eral small things that still needed to be done." Andrews added
that currently the bar has been put up and booths will soon be
installed.

Orion Wingfreld ’10, a member of the pub staffing sub-
committee, said that essential needs such as drink, food and
entertainment options had been settled. Orion added that he

hopes students will enjoy the selection and will find the pub
affordable “We won’t be taking people to the cleaners with
prices,” he said.

Ultimately, Andrews and Wingf‘ield confirmed that, barring
any unexpected delays, the pub will open after winter break,
Still, both expressed hope that Lylc’s could have a big “opening
night" before students left for the semester.

Currently plans are moving forward to sift through the
applications for managers and bartenders. still, the commit—
tee must answer several final questions before the pub can
be opened. Chief among these is whether Lyle's will be open
for a full week, just the weekend, or on several days scattered
throughout the week. Once the staff has been trained, paint
colors chosen, the liquor license received, health inspections
completed and the city council grants the needed permissions,
the pub should be ready to open.

Classics department mourns loss of" Iconic couple

BY Cnltls NEUBERT

To members of the Grinnell Classics departs
ment, Bill McKibbcn was more than a profess
sot: he was a scholar, mentor, legend and friend.
His death last Wednesday at age 91 leaVes a
large void in the Classics department and in
the Grinnell community, despite his retirement
nearly 25 years ago.

lVIchibbcn first came to Grinncll in 1952,
and was named a full professor in 1958. He
taught Classics alongside his wife, Betty McK-
ibben, who died last july. For Grinnellians who
knew the couple, they Lived almost as one per
son. “It’s impossible to talk about Bill without
talking about Betty," said Monessa Cummins,
Classics. “The two_ went together in everything
they did."

“They always still walked handtinshaudr"
added Richard Cleaver ’75, a former student

of the McKibbens “They looked like such a
wonderful couple together, People who didn’t
know them always said, “They always looked
so happy together,”

The couple was well-respected {or their
kccn ability to remember and recall minute
details. “I considered them both to be true
teachers and scholars," said Ed Phillips, Clas-
sics. “They brought their scholarship and
minds to their students and classes. They had
a wonderful ability to light sparks of percept
tion and intelligence and wrsdom and clarity
ofvision in their students,”

Studying the classics was their passion
in life. “They were very genuine in their love
of classical antiquity and learning generally,”
said Joe Cumrnins, Classics and Philosophy,
Their love of the subject was infectious."

Both Betty and Bill taught throughout

the department. Betty focused on intermedir
ate and elementary Latin, while Bill taught
much of the curriculum and promoted-com
ncctions between departments. They contil‘r
ucd sharing their love ofclassics with students
well alter retirement through weekly Greek
and Latin sight leading groups held at their
home.‘ Latin and Greek were like old friends
to them,” said Monessa Cumminsa “And they
had the kind of ease with the languages that
put.evetyoiic else at case.”

“What always came out of those sessions
was the extent of the deference paid to Bill
by the other faculty members," said Mitchell
Parks '08, one of the students that attended
the weekly sessions. “When one of the other
faculty members couldn‘t come up with an ant
swei to a question, Bill would always say how
he had interpreted this particular line for years

and years,"

Reading group could be intimidating for
students," added Moncssa Cummins, “Except
that they just loved the languages so much,
the McKibbcns would sit back in their chairs
and be so relaxed, and read with such enthusis
asrn that the snidents couldn't help forgetting
about themselves and they would stop being
nervous.”

But for all their scholarship, the McKibt
bcns are most remembered for their kindness
outside of the classroom. “I respected them
because they were people who epitomized all
the great classical virtues" Phillips said, “coun
age. humanity. generosity, wisdom."

“When I came they became substitute
patents for my wife and me" Phillips added.
“They made the department a tamily."
