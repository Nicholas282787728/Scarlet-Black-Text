ation of campus resources, the college must
decide which elements of the architect-
authoted master plan will be implemented, and
when these changes will be put into effect.

One of rho lrurresr topics is Studcnts, Faculty,
administrators and trustees ponder the future look
orrhr Campus is the rare or Darby Gymnasium.

why Dathy?Thc inerlrry has been brought inro
focus recently by an arebirecrurnl sludy. The study
irselr was made a priority because “The existing
Darby site has been ldenrlhed as rbe new campus
crossroads, where a new campus center and library

shepley Bulnneb Richardson and Abbot. Irs loeiie
rron in rbe heart ornrnny ruurro construction sites
