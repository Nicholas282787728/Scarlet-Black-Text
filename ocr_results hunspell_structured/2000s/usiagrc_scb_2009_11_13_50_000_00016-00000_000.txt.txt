From the Editor to die Readers

“It must go," said two members of the Clark house
council. “it's either removing your mustache, Rowley7 or
it’s the paddle for us," said the preps. .

So a prize possession of this writer was “smoothed our’
after months of patient grooming One side was a little
darker than the other, but, nevertheless, there was some-
thing therellll ' ,

They say if you can’t make a decision for yourself, oth7
ers will make it for you. The preps made my decision for
me, but I feel like a man walking around barefooted out
doors in the dead ofwinter! ‘

At long last it happened! After two months ofwaiting
and after two months of swalling words of disapproval,
removal of the “prize possession” was inevitable.“

Right now I'm like an animal when it sees itselfin the
mirror I look behind the mirror to see who the stranger is!

The saying nevertheless still goes that “whatever is lost
can be gained again.” .

But thank God they used an electric razor!
