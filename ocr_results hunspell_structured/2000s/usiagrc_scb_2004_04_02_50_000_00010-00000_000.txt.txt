Everybody’s a Winner

juson rathad
eclectic innovator

A couple of days back 1 was ralking wirh a Mash major who
informed me rhar John Kerry had eclipsed the magical delegare num.
ber of2,162, thereby securing rhc Deinocraric nonrinarion. Upon
hearing the news, l gee in my friend's face, pushed my index finger
inro his chest and srernly said. “Look, silly Marh inaror, life isn'r abour
numbers, ir’s abour power," Afrcr showing him irrehirable cmplrlml
evidence of my claim in rhe form of rho 2000 elecrion resulrs, rhe
Bush rare cum and Republican Medicare reform. he quickly dropped
airy asserrion dam is was rime for me to ger our ofrhe race.

So hares rhe new eleerion plan my ream ofcxpcrrs has devised.
We ger Presidenr Bush ro spend hundreds ofnrillions ofdollars ad-
verriaing against lohn Kerry And we're nor ralkiiig abour sofr, prerry
boy John Edwards ads, but rhe hardcore sruff. We wanr rlre classic
George W. ones where you superimpose Kerry's image onto a iriad
head ofsaddam Hussein, osama Bin L'ldcn and Michael Jackson.
After the Republicans have expended all of rheir resources and en.
ergy on anacking Kerry, we have him drop out of die race. Then, or

die Dcmocmtlc Narional Convenrion, rhe delegates change rheirvoies
ro narhod, giving rhe Dcnnocrars their best shor ar raking back rlre
Whue House. While rhe DNC and l iron our rlre ﬁnalderoils orihe
plan, let’s eonrinue to map ourwhere I srand on ihe issues. As a rrue
Grinnellran liberal, lt was only a runner of nine berore I laid our my
plan ro cnacr social insrice reforms. sadly, righr new ii seems like rho
dcbarc over social iiisrice has reached a poiur of
no renini.

On one side. conservarives are quick io give
such advice as: “lfir doesn't kill you, ironly millsm
you sri-onger They are consisrenrly rhe ones
poinringro HomrioAlgci, nskrngoppressed people
ro srarr working and quit worrying abour nor
having heahh care or deceiu schools onl r re orher
end are liberals who argue ihar rhe impoverished
are more ihan willing ro work hard. bur are de.
nied she opporrunirics necessary ro succeed. The
sharpesr inrellecrual liberals, like Mos Defarid Kanye Wesr, cease
lessly lamenr abour rhe pliglrr of poor people who dream of making
ir big, bur end up hopelessly mired in a culrure surrounded by vio.
lencc, drugs and poverry.

So whar’s rhe solurion ro rhis seemingly inrraciable problem? Give
everyone whar rhey wanr. Since overcoming hardship is so essenrial
ro conservarive idenriry, rhe governmerie should mandare that con»
servadves move our of rheir mansions and into public housing in

deserve it.

I call for an end to
afﬁrmative action for
everyone who doesn’t

areas such as Appalachia Mott I laven and Cornprorr To ensure rliar
iheir characrei is especially srrong we could force rhein ro see whar
rrs like to live on welfare and send rheir kids to roach inresred schools.

Meanwhile, rlic poor and oppressed who have always dreamed of
wealrh, can be moved inro rhe newly unoccupied sribr bs and man.
sions rhar rich conservarivcs have lrisroricrilly lived ii Th is way rhey
will ecirauily have access ro rhe opporruniries
and resources required for success. Elecring
nirliod ineans rlrar everyone's a winner.

Now, whenever l discuss social iiisrice 1 run
incvnably faced wirh rhe ouerrion orwhcrher l
siipporr affirmarive aerion. To rhe surprise of
many ormy supporters, 1 call for an end ro ah
ﬁrmarive actionr .forev yonc who doesn‘r do
serve it. Afﬁrmarive action for racial ininoriues
and rhe poor. No irroie affriinarive action for
young, wlrirc, blond feniale anchors on Fox
News No more afrriinarivc acnon for Denise Richards when consid—
ciing who is qualiﬁed ro play a convincing nuclear physicisr. No
more afﬁrmarive acrion for paul Walker, which means no more acr—
ing jobs. ever. Elcct roiliod rhis November and pin an end ro rlre
depciidancy cycle rlrar has plagued all of rhe uirworrhy beneﬁciaries
ofaffirmarive acrion, including rich frat boys named Bush.
