s the treasurer of Grinnell College
in a prc~computer world, Waldo
Walker, Bioioy, had to contend with
somcthing rhat one docsn't hear about
a whole lot anymore—a ledger, a
book used to keep records ofbusincss
transactions. Walker would spend
hours poring over the large book with
an accounting calculator on his desk
and, most likely, ink stains on his cuffsThen, in the early 1980s,
Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who was a rrustcc of the College at the
time, gave Walker something that would irrevocably alter the
way that he did work—«an E2 computer. “The first thing I did
was play pinball," Walker recalled with a smile.

Walker was part of a growing rrcnd. Grinnell College
became a computing school in thc mid-I970s and by the mid-
19805 the Internet started to take offand esmail became a more
common communicative tool. Walker, who served as Executive
Vice President and Dean of the College at this time, played
an important role in encouraging computer and e-mail use on
campus.

In his administrative role, Walker applied for and received
a grant to purchase 60 computers for faculty use. In spite of the
fact that the computers were placed in the faculty member's
offices, “they wouldn’t touch them,”Walker said. The College
ended up having to pay professors to take courses in computer
use one summer so that the school’s investment would not go
to waste. George Drakc '56, History, who was president at rhc
time, resisted using a computer {or the ﬁrst two years of his
term. Students, on the other hand, took to the new technology
much more quickly and without prompting. Aware of the
socializing power of computcrs, “srudcnts srarrcd c-mailing
immediately after we became a computing school,"Walkcr said.

Since then, esmail use has become an everyday neccssiry.
According to Michael Pifer, Network Specialist ofInformation
Technology scrviccs, in 2007, alonc rhcrc wcrc 7.5 million
clean (non—spam) e-mails sent to Grinnell accounts. In 2009
there have been an average of 21,554 incoming emails to
Grinncll accounts per day. This translates ro roughly seven
e-mails per College e-mail address, a figure that is deﬂated by
inactive accounts.

Clearly, the e-mail has become a major method for intra-
campus communication.To some, e-mail offers a way to make
friends with people while avoiding potentially awkward pres
friendship conversations. An email can be carefully crafted
or casual and brief. While some consider them impersonal,

 

 

 

c-mails offer efficiency and security Walker norcd that rhcrc
is no “c-mail tag”—oncc you send an e-inail, you can be fairly
certain that it has reached its intended recipient. Phil Sletten ’11
lauded rhc utiliry ofesmails, highlighting their efficiency. “The
cosrs arc certainly ourweighcd by the benefits," he concluded.

Steve Briscoe, Director of Security, echoed Slettcn's
sentiments. Erinail provides a swift and efﬁcient method to
rcach rhc campus community The only downside orcamailing,
he said,is that it can take a io‘toftiinc to sort through the e-mails
and distinguish junk mail from important esmails. Another
downside: “speed is dangerousisornetimes you say things
and rcgrct it," he said. For Briscoe, c-rnaii ﬂubs arc parricularly
dangerous, because his all-campus correspondences have been
collected on the blog stevenbriscoesitvedmyllfe.blogspot.eom.

The same “dangers" are present in private correspondences.
One of this article's aurhors signcd off an c-mail asking for a
job at a Canadian berry farm, “Thank you for your time and
money." She was not offered an interview.

logging in

There are, of course, more factors involved in communicating
via e~mail than just sending them. Esmail’s efﬁciency requires
that account holders log in on a regular basis. on average.
students intcrvicwcd said they loggcd in six to cighr rimcs a day.
There are, of course, drastic outliers. Aurora OminnsElmore '12
said she checks her email once daily, while Molly McArdle '09
estimated that she checks it “a kazilllon times a day."

“Particularly because I have outlook which dings every time
I get an email and because I have an iPod touch which allows
mc to compulsivcly check my c-inail—cvcn during class,"
McArdle wrote, unsurprisingly, in an e-mail.

Students who don’t check their email addresses quite so
compulsively, and even those who do, also use other forms of
clccrronic cornmunicarions—GrinncilPlans, instant messaging
services, SMSs and particularly the Facebook wall and inboxi
for speedy nonsverbal modes of communication. Facebook
threatens c-mail's role as the site for informal communication,
with a majority of students interviewed checking Faeebook
more than esmail. Students often said they prefer to use
Facebook for social and personal correspondences, and c-mail
for academic and professional matters.

For some people, esmail plays a greater role in the social
realm. Ruth Campbell ’11 noted that email, rather than
Facehook, was the site for developing relationships her firstr

 

year. Campbcll rccountcd how she got to know hcr friend
Felicity Slater'li via e-mails about their tutorial readings. Later
at a party. they “decided they] would be friends in real life and
nor just rhrough email." A similar string of correspondences
brought Campbell into her iirsr romance at Grinnell. “we
would climb together and hang out but it was never really a
relationship except through email." she said. “Only in email
were we able to be like ‘oh, we kinda Like each other."'

etiquette

E-mail culture at Grinnell is somewhat structured in
an unwritten etiquette. Though its use varies somewhat,
people tend to have strong opinions on how ro communicate
with different people via c-mail, what levels of rormality are
appropriate when, and how to begin and signsoff emails. "I
certainly change in formality [depending on who 1 am writing].
Only when I am replying to e-mail to me that‘s been sent to me
that only needs a brief reply, do 1 remove the heading entirely,”
Sletten '11 said. “That's the only time when I will start writing
as opposed to having a little salutation at the beginning."

Students expressed the most uncertainty about the most
appropriate salutations for professors Many students start
simply using thc professor’s name. orhers opt for the traditional
“dear so-and-so.” Still others open with a friendly “hi" or
“hey.” One student thought writing “hello” was too jilted and
violated the unexplored code of etiquette for faculty-student
communication.

When this etiquette is breached, the result is often awkward.
Last year, while Alex Littler '10 served as a mentor for a section
of Stephen Sieck’s, Chemistry, organic chemistry class, things
went awry when Littler decided Saturday night that he needed
to send Sleek an etmail.“I was a little intoxicated and I needed
to send him an c-mail for some reason but I was like ‘blah
blah, hearts and rainbows, Alex," Littler said. “But he never
responded.”

E-maiiing with authority figures can be tricky, especially
when you‘re related to the authority figure in question. Peter
Henry ’09 says that the most dramatic eel-nail he ever received
was from his mother, a response to his first e-mail from abroad
that mentioned he had been enjoying London and eating tuna
fish. “The only thing she responded back with an nllseaps
‘HOLD THE TUNAl'" Henry recounted. Henry's mother
went on, in great detail and “like a thousand exclamations," to
inform her son about the mercury content of tuna. chiding him
