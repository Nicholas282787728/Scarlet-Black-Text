she said. “l'vc been spending hnlrrhe time in Grinnell and halrrhc

Though Nick chose to spend most of last summer back in

Working in a local sewing factory. “I was rcasscmhllng broken screen»

Amy spent the entire summer in Grinnell and got re know some or

With school in progress, Amy's interaction
wirh rcwnies has decreased since the summer.
“Some or the comics I still talk to, like the
ones who Went nway to college," she said. “Bur the townies who are
snll here really don’t want anything To do with me now. It's okay, though.
I've met some great people er the school."

Nor all errhc people Amy has encountered at school are new, how-

"Nick and l have a surf competition going for grades," she said.
“He thinks he’s beating me, lsur I don't rhink so. Our teacher told us
we should hand in our papers anonymously because there's always a
huge nuthursr when we get d1cm back."

For his part, Nick rhinks the sibling comperiricn is healthy, as well

he said. “She usually comes in on rhe shorrcnd crrhc stick. I think I'm
bearing her by halrn grade on one paper," Given her cge, he gives his
