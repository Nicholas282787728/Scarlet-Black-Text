Dear Slymied,

The question you ponder
is one we have rill struggled
to answer. srnrtrt or sexy?
Madeline Albl‘ight or Marr
rth Carey? Plato or nrtkcd
Plato? These ltre deep onesr
tious that cut to the core of
a person. if that core isn’t already exposed by
the costume.

One might approach your question by
snyrng this: A person who dresses as R2-D2
is unlikely to also successfully pull off‘slutty"
and may instead enter the territory of“pathet»

10 things to make you cry

Dear Rye Bread,

I hate the way you taste to me, and the way
you ruin my meal.

I hate the way you l-lll my stomach, and the
way you make me feel.

I hire your big dumb swirl of rye, and how
you're in my Outtake every time.

I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even
makes me rhyme.

I hate it. I hate that you're neither whent not
white. I hate you cause you‘re rye.

I hate it when you make me gag, even worse
when you make me cry.

I hate how you are always around, and how
you drive me off the wall.

But mostlyi hate the why you aren’t Italian
Combo Sub. Not even close, not even a little bit,
not even at all.
