Students. discuss' Issues of peace

BY ELIZA-EVE LEAS

From International Relations to sociology, issues orpeace
and conflict have become more apparent in a variety orfLelds.

Last week, the Peace Studies program presented two key-

- note speakers, 21 student speakers. 14 student photographs
and a concert in Bob’s.

Grinnell’s First Peace Studies Conference highlighted the
program itself and expressed its emphasis, while giving stut
dents the opportunity to present research papers in an acat
deLnLe setting. David Western, Posttljoctotal Mellon Fellow
and Lecturer in Peace Studies, outlined his primary goals,

Hopefully the conference gave the Impression that Peace
studies Ls a serLous endeavor that looks at serious problems
Ln the world and hopes for seriously-minded students to en
gage with those students,’ Western said.‘ ‘[We wanted to] lift
up the proﬁle of Peace Studies on campus, get students in
volved.. . and rnimie an academic conference at a professional
level." V

The students who presented were excited to present pa-
pers in a setting similar to that ofa professional conference.

"It is agreat opportunity for students [to see] what an aca-'

demic professional presentation would be like," Lithg Cong
'11.saLd. “You get a response and feedback from students and
faculty and keynote speakers who are equally passionate about
your project."

For her presentation, Cong spoke about providing legal
aid to migrant workers Ln shanghai thh the Davis Foun»
dation Project for Peace. Mona” Ghadirl 11 presented on
women’s rights Ln Iran, and appreciated not just the chance to
experience an academic setting, but the opportunity to share
something she cared about.

”I’m thinking about goLng Lnto acadenua, so Lt seemed like
a really good chance to patti pate in a sLLnulatLd type of the
same kind ofdialoguc,"Ghadiri saLd. “And l’nL really passion-
are about Iran... maybe somebody who does not know any-
tlLLng about Lt can leaLn about something that I thLak_rs really

important."

The discussions had very WLdettan'ging subjects, from
“Women and (ln)Justhe," the panel that Ghadiri participated
in, to “The Arts and Peacebuilding," Western said that the
variety was deliberate, because ofhow the Peace Studies pros
gram is structured.

“We stressed [being] interdLsciplinary in the conference
just as we do In the program,"Westetn said.

Ryan Carlinu ’10 spoke at “Human Rights: In Concert or
Tension with Peace," about how gay rights are largely ignored
at the international human rights level. He also enjoyed the
assortment ofsubjects at the conference.

“I think there were very interesthg and dLvetse topics pte>
sented. Also, they were very professional and well-organized,
Carlino said.

western and Ghadiri also recognized the high qualIty of
all of the .Gtinnell student presentations, However, Ghadiri
and Carlino mentioned that the timing of the panels was less
than idealemany ofthe discussions were held at hours during
which students had classes on Friday

"Next me, [there should not be] presentations in the
morning because a lot of people werent able to come because
they have class Ln the morning, Carlino said.

Despite the scheduling difﬁculties, and the absence of a
concrete plan to bring back the conference next year, the stu-
dents who participated would like to see another conference,
according to Western.

“1 tthk [all of the presenters] round Lt really rewatdmg."
Heather Riggs '12 sald, n panelist on “Torture and the Nero
LnalLaatLon orthe HotthLc." Rngs also helped to organize the
photo exhibit, something that Cong would lLke to see grow in
following years.

“We could expand photo ethbit tozo in thc future,“Cong
saLd. “i really hope the Peace studies Conference can coL-Lthue
year after year,“
