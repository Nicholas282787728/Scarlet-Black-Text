swrpes at countries who “blame their society's ills on the
West" and “those who cling to power through corruption

Plans back online without Secrets

After a cease»and-desist, Secrets and Notes conspicuously absent from website

hit New FINNEGAN

it's no secret—the popular cyber-torum site GrirrnellPlans
is incompletct

On Dec 15, Ian Atha ’09, who owns the server space host-
ing Plans, disabled access to the Website after receiving a ceases
and-desist noticc.Threc days later, on Dec 18, Plans returned.
Although the core of Plans was tip and runs
ning, most users quickly noticed that the of?
used Secrets and Notes features were not.

After operation had resumed, Atha said
he decided wrth Plans administrators to rerun
porarrly drsable Notes, a discussion hoard rot
Plans users, and Secrets, a servrce that lets us
ers post anonymous messages that must first
be approved by Plans administrators.

“We wanted to get Plans back up as soon as possible, and
the way we could do rlrat is by rcmpomrily disabling secrets
and Notes,"said Plans Administrator Mark_ Root-Wiley’09.

Atha,who received the notice when, would not comment
on the source of the notice or the reasons behind it but in an
e-mail to the Sij in December wrote that “the cause is not yet

”The cause is not yet to be
tommummled, built was

to be communicated, but it was not libel/slander. Also, it was
not about particular content, but about alleged practices.” Atha
declined to comment further.

Root-Wiley declined to comment on the content of the
cease»and»desist notice or whether it was related to Secrets
or Notes. “During the time that [Plans] is down, we're going
to be looking at the terms of use," Root-Wiley
said. “Until that point we felt that it would be
appropriate to have Secrets and Notes notup and
functioning."

RootrWiley said he does not expect any
changes will be made to Secrets and Notes and
predicts they will return by the end ofthe semesr
ter. "You can expect to see them it sometime in
the next two months," he said. “ But] it's kind
of early in the process of figuring that out, so I can’t guarantee
anything.”

Plans users, such as Leah Krandel ’09, have lamented the
absence of secrets in particular. “I’m totally miserable because
that was my favorite study break,” she said. “Now I’ve had to
resort to gorng on Faeebook,whlch is totally inferior."

SGA

from p, 1 going to be a different SGA than last year.”

SGA Vice President of Student Affairs
John Burrows ’10 deﬁned his duty as a cabinet member to bal-
ance working on long-term projects and daily duties, includ-
ing working with adminisrration and College committees. “l'm
trying to balance all that committee work against all those long
term projects," Burrows said, Bur-rows said he currently serves
on at least eight committees with other members of the Cole
lege.

Burrows said marry goals mentioned in hrs campaign. such
as rrnproving student wellness and rescheduling academic
bienks,weie in their beginning phases.“Especinl.ly towards the
end of [last] semester you’re seeing a lot of projects started or
even worked on or accomplished,“ Burrows said.

Burrows said that his goals "have changed as new issues
have arisen, i,e. the issues encountered with Student Affairs as
well as students' frustration being unable to communicate with
administrators."

SGA President Neo Moralte ’09, who listed diversifying the
curriculum and revamping the off-campus living application in
her original campaign statement, echoed a sentiment similar to
Burrows, Morake stated that work had begun on the curricu-
lum near the end oflast semester and was well underway, while
work had yet to begin on reworking oitrcampus applications.

“It was harder to focus on [my goals] at the beginning of
the semester only because [it took] time to ﬁgure out the role

projects and whatever else was coming up."

According to former SGA President Chris Hall ’07, many
of the projects completed during his time on Cabinet were not
sparked until “going into winter break.” SGA’s projects in the
’05-'07 academic year included adding the second vice presi-
dent position to cabinet, creating the STIFUND and working
on an in-hOuse drug policy,

sues."

Hoye also said accomplishments such as encouraging and
securing student spots on the Committee on Academic stand»
ing, which deals with academic probation and dishonesty. are
evidence of progress in SGA last semester.

“It’s the only committee that deals directly with strident is
sues that didn’t have a student representative,"Hoye said.“We’re
