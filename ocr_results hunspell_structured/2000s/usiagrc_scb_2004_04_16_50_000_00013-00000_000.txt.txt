replied ro my requesr. Feeling excluded from rhe earnpus
discourse on hip—hop. 1 srarred my own wirh Josh Brody.
iosh appeared ro know very lirrie abour hiphop. conse.
ouenrly, he inrerviewed me.

I think that part of

work, rhough, was rhe same elemenr rhar made rhe 1988

allows rhe hsrener ro reaer ro ir in more subieerive ways.
