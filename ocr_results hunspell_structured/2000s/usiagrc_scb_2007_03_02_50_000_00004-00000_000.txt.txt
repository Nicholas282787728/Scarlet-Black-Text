SGA Election Candidates

SGA President

 

ANNA GILBERT '09 -“I've been really involved in Grinnell in
the past. [and I've] been frustrated how slow change happens...
students can get really frustrated and thcy’rc not talking to the
right people. I want to bcttcr the communication. 1 want to de»
crease the remoteness of SGA. I really want to do this using the
Student Staff connection. Student Staff has a much more per
sonal Connecticut [Also,] I really want student ro have a say about
what goes inside [with the Arhlctic Center rcnovanon].ThjrdlyI
want to increase the administration’s support of community sei—
viee. I want to return the staff position to a full timejob."

 

 

 

MEGAN GOERING ’08 - “I think my experience in SGA and
outside it can be uniquely helpful to the organization. it’s a Come
bination ufinsitler strategy and outsider perspective. My first pri—
ority is placing initiatives at the center of all SGA advocacy. I
think SGA can do a better job of helping students to turn their
ideas into initiatives. Last semester during Finals Week. we spent
57,000 on study breaks. We can encourage that community all
year long That’s one thing that can fight the culture ofstrcss here.

Iwant to improve communication and access to information. ."

HOWARD KROHN '03 a “I really enjoy Grinnell a lot and. ..i
think that as president 1 would do a good job. The main reason
is just contributing back to the community because I've gained
so much from it. ...l would like campus dining to be more res
sponsive to student interests, There's a serious problem with the
shortage of workers and [it is] important to ﬁll up those spaces so
that students can have an enjoyable dining experiencc. ...I’d like
to bridge some of the gaps between student staff and SGA id
like students to have a greater role in determining what kind oi‘
classes will be offered...”

take advantage orthe opportunities that a early exist and also create
new ones. l'ra really enthusiastic about the college’s recent empha-
sis on interdiseiplinary study, speciﬁcally in the EKI (Expanding
Knowledge Initiative). C]onnecred to that is the idea ofservicc
learning, which allows students to combine activism and commu,
nity engagement with coursework ml think that it’s important. ..to
evaluate the OffrCampusSrudy procedures. I want to look at for»
eign language credits, why yearlong study abroad is discoulitged.”

LINDSAY DENNIS '08 7 “I’ve been in SGA since the beginning
of this year; this is my second term as a senatoi. I was really inter-
ested in getting onto Cabinet and i feel like Academic Affairs is a
really important place....As a transfer student I’m concerned with
making sure the transfer process is as smooth as possible in terms
of credits. ...I’m [also] very interested in concentrations. I would
like to make current ones more substantive and work on getting
new ones next year and in the future. Finally, I would really like [to
improve] the amount of transparency in the Off Campus study
Board which often rejects people without rebuttal.”

 

 

After numerous student requests, Election Board has de-
cided to postpone elections until Wednesday, March 7.
This is the last possible day to have the election according
the SGA’s constitution. After pushing back the deadline
for applications, many on Election Board felt there was
not enough time for candidates to campaign, Addition-
ally, some thought the weather may have interfered with
postering and meeting students. The candidate forum is
still scheduled for 8 p.m. Sunday in Rosenfield 101.

 

 

 

 

 

ERIC OLSON '08 a “I’ve got a pretty extensive background in
SGA and I’m just really passionate about a lot or the affairs this
position would handle, including JudCo and the EKI. I want to
promote the goals of the BIG and hopefully get more permanent
faculty hired at Grinnell. 1 want to raise awareness about Judco
and sort of demystify it for] people [who] may have a distorted
perception of it. I'd-like to promote the academic achievements of g v
'Grinnell students....Maybe pushing for more research opportunir ., ’
ties or IVLAPs. There could be more opportunities [for students to I “x
be recognizeleherc is potential to do more.”

Vice President of Student Affairs

NICKBLENCOWE ’08 - “I’ve been involved in SGA as a senator
and as Administrative Coordinator...but my real passion on cams
pus is deﬁnitely student advocacy SGA needs to be more efﬁcient,
more responsive, and more responsible. [We also need] greater
transparency in both housing and security. In regard to housing
ﬁnes, the current system is ridiculous. With security, some of its
policies need to be reviewed and possibly rewritten, particularly the
drug policy. And sexual assault olicy should be revisited every year
to make sure its up to scratch. Finally] I want to [fit] selfrgoverr
nance. It’s ridiculous that it hasn't been taken care ofbefore now."

JAN KOSZEWSKI ’08 7 “I've always felt deeply attached and
deeply committed to the school. For whatever reason, I empar
thize with a lot of students and the best way I can serve them is
by fulfilling that position. I’ve been concerned about the Com—
munity Service Center all along. I want to see a place that's pro—
vided with a fulltime staff. [Also,] I’d like to increase alumni giv-
ing. I believe it would have a huge impact on things like tuition
and student life. Honestly, there’s really a whole [lot] of issues,
hall fines, extending Athletic Center hours.”
