Community action in town

sv BRENDAN MACKIE

one in lo Grinnell townspeople live in poverty.
While Grinnell college students are worrying about
ﬁnishing their papers, some members of their com-
munity worry abour hearing rheir homes.

The problems rhe poor in Grinnell face are varied
but basic to the rest of us: things like getting food,
finding a job and giving their children something
special for Christmas. Mid Iowa Community Act
tion (MICA), a community action program, has ex-
isted since Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty and is a
principal actor in combating poverty in the town of
Grinnell.

MICA is an umbrella agency that puts people in
touch with over 50 programs providing everything
from food to child care. MICA is most concerned
with "providing family development services to at-
risk and low-income families," said Dick Stockner,
MICA’s director for Poweshiek county,

The formula for determining who is below the
poverty Line was designed in the 1960s, when it was
assumed that children would be raised in two-par-
ent households where only one parent worked. For
this reason the formula does not include childcare,
a huge living cost. “By the time a family with both
parents working in the jobs that are available for little
education and no experience are done wirh their [bat
sic] expenditures, they’re in the red about $10,000,"
Stoekner said.

MICA tries to help cover these basic needs, giving
out boxes offood and household items, in addition to
referring attrisk families to other programs such as
Head Start and the Low Income Home Energy As—
sistance Program (LIHEAP).

Head Start offers education and child care to low
income families, while LIHEAP helps pay needy
people's heating bi]ls.The number of scrviccs MICA
refers people to is simply staggering, Stockner said.
“I've barely scratched the surface of what MICA
does."

Many students have worked with MICA as scc~
retaries or babysitters at Head Start. Marie Tan ’05,
the 2005 Grinnell corps fellow, is spending her firsr
post—Grinnell year working for MICA, which is lot
cated only a couple steps away from Saints Rest. It is
a life far diﬂ'erent from her time as a student. “When
1 was studying ar Grinnell my life consisrcd offriends,
classes and the occasional grocery trip to Fareway. It
was confined mostly between sixth and 10‘” Avenue,"
she said. “You sleep, you eat, you study. That's what
you’re here for."

Since working at MICA, Tan has seen the effect

of poverty on the community. “They’re walking the
streets of Grinnell, you just don't see them. Well, we
might see them ifwe knew who they were,"Tan said.

Amy Graves, coordinator of the college’s com-

munity service Ccnrer and a narive Grinnellian, said

that it is easy for students and community members
to ignore the town’s poverty. “There‘s no central ar-
eas of run-down dilapidated houses," she said. “The
closest we have are loWrincome aparrmcnrs, the trailer
park and a few crummy houses."

Tan said she was unsure of how to characterize
the town’s conditions. “i hesitate to use the word
poverty," she said. "It’s a big umbrella rerm. And all
these people underneath this umbrella — they're are all
different. just like everybody at Grinnell is different.
The only thing that puts them under poverty is their
income range."

The causes of poverty vary too. “Most families
are in poverty for a short duration,” Stockner said.
“They're knocked off their feet for one or two years.
And then they’ll turn around." Other families are fat
from reaching self-sufficiency, impeded by drug ad-
diction, mental illness and domestic violence. Such
families ofren receive aid for generations.

“There is a misconception across the United States
that those in poverty don’t work," Stockner said. “The
majority of rhem do work, but they’re working in jobs
that are low payinglfyou look at our 2100 individut
uls we serve, 55 percent of them work and that's int
cliiding the elderly. You’re talking about 70 percent
of those coming to MICA are doing their best work
rhey can, ir's just rhar the pay's low and they can'r
make ends meet."

National or international factors often cause pov—
erty and leave individuals without the ability to lin-
prove rheir condirions, Layoffs. the sluggish economy
and globalization have left their mark on the lives of
people across the wotld.The Giinnell community is
no different but poverty advocates say that the town
is dedicated to helping rhose Ill need. According to
Stockner, “Poweshiek county citizens are very give
ing. They and the organizations they’re involved m,
including churches, really care rind do the best they
can.’

As exams end and students return home for
Christmas, the problem of poverty will continue. Pov—
erty affects every nation and every people. Tan still
remains hopeful and determined. “My goal will be
accomplished when there's none of ir anymore," she
said. “I've learnt the reality of it. I’m learning, every
day I do something, that the individual has power."

Campu groups act

BY KATIE MCMULLEN

As the smell of Christmas cookies
wafts through campus, smdents can
feel the holiday season approaching,
But many will go without cookies this
year or gifts or a roof.

“Rural poverty is a little bit difficult
to identify because it's not like we have
people sleeping in the street or in card
board boxes,“ said Ben Klooster '08,
social Jnsrice Action Group (SJAG)
member and coordinator of the Come
rnnnity Meal. “There's maybe not a sig
nificant amount of poverty, but greater
than most people expect in Grinnell."

Several student groups address pow
erry within the town, including such as
Mortar Board's Giving Tree, SJAG's
Community Meal and Habitat for Hu-
manity

Coeehair ofthe Giving Tree Project,
Megan Dimltt ’06, said that the Project
is vital at this time of the year. “With
the economy like it is, hearing prices are
soaring," she said. “Families are just re-
ally tight on money right now."

Morrar Board has organized came
pus sponsorships for families in need
during the holiday season. The Giv-
ing Tree Project is run rhrough Second
Mile.

“They find fami—
liesin necd,take down
their information and
then distribute these
families to people,
groups and they buy
gifts for them, wmp
them and then this
organization delivers
these packages," she
said. “What we do is we act as a go,
between and we distribute groups on
campus."

away”

Another staple of community ser.

vice at Grinnell is the Community
Meal, sponsored by SJAG. Accord-
ing to Klooster, SJAG coordinates the
weekly meal by getting student and
community groups to cook and serve
the meal.

“About 150 people come a week and
ear and meet each other and have some
community and some food," he said.
“It functions both as kind of a soup
kitchen and just a place for people who

people get out there and start
doing it... it’s not going to go

wouldn't get out normally to get out
and meet some people and have fun."

The Community Meal, now in its
fifth year, is free and takes place every
Tuesday at Davis Elementary through-
out the year.

Grinnell students work on housing
for lowdncome families in Grinnell
through the work of the Grinnell Col—
lege Chapter of Habitat for Humanity.

“The basic goal of Habitat is to
help out families who maybe don't have
a lot of income, help provide them with
housing,” said Habitat co—coordinator
Evan Miller '07. “It’s not really a char-
ity organization because the family 3C,
tually has to pay back.a]l of the money
that is spent on the house and they
actually have to contribute to the cons
struction ofthe house, but it’s basically
a nol'rproﬁl‘ organization that seeks to
help people with small incomes."

Student support of these groups has
often been mixed.

“We have gotten a lot of participa~
tion,” said Dimitt. “Usually it comes
more from the faculty and staff that
organize it because some students don't
have a lot of money this time of year, .
but students usually help out any way
they can,"

Klooster said that
SJAG has had some
trouble this semester
getting enough stUr
dent volunteers and
encouraged students
to become more ac-

“Change can’t ,

happen until people
get out there and start doing it,” he
said. "I think starting at a local level like
with the Community Meal or the stuff
that Mortar Board is doing and then
continuin to look in different areas [is
important .You can’t fight poverty un—
til you get out there and do it, and it’s
not going to go away until people start
ﬁghting it,"

While partaking in rhe holiday
festivities, Klooster urged students to
get involved and help others. He said
Grinnell was the perfect place to start:
“I deﬁnitely encourage people to start
in their own backyards."
