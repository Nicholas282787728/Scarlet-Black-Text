What conditions did you play witness to
within the plant that the workers were sub—
ject to?

One ofrhe things I’ll never forget is people
standing shoulderttotshouldor, a man with an
electric knife. all day, cutting the legs off the
turkeys and chickens, but right [under] him,
people cutting meat, and the ﬂoor ﬁlthy with
feathers and blood—itwas dangerous.

Spéakingonalargcrscalc,sincetheprek
idential campaign began there was very little
discussion about immigration in the actual
campaigning. Since Obarna has taken omee
there doesn’t seem to be much focus on it at
allt ] was wondering what you think about
the current administration and Congress‘s
overall focus and action on the issue of imt
migration?

I think I've said often that every elected
ofﬁcial that had anything to do with immi-
gralion law should hang their head in shame.
They have let immigration law become a po-
litical mess that it’s now more political than
anything.

One of the worst things was in the year
2003 they swept immigration law under
Homeland Security law—«he worst thing that
could have possibly happened.Thcn itbecame

militaristic, That was all political. They stood g

atonnd. The elected politicians did not stand
up for the right thing.Thcy didn't do the right
thing.

And on a state level, late lastyear you said
that Governor Culver was failing to keep us
from “bleeding to death." Have Cnhter and
the state government responded in the past
months since then?

No. in fact, the governor turned
his back on [The Archbishop,
myself, Paul Real, and three other
representatives from the Hispanic
ministry and dioceses] the tiny we
went down to see [secretary of
Homeland security] Janet Nept
ollttlno. He knew who we were. He
turned his back on us. He has not
been responding.

I would cl'iuclze the state of Iowa. They
have not done enough. This is the largest raid
in the histoiy of Iowa. They have not stood up
and said,“We can't do much as a state,hul now
on a federal level we expect [the government]
to do more." And. they have not done that.
That's Wrong.

With the situation at Henry's Turkey
Service [in which mentally disabled men
were subject to illegal workhouse conditions
for years], is there anything you can dmw
comparisons between the two situations?
And whether that’s a problem on a statewide
level or a nationwide level?

Once you have an ingrained immoral con-
dition in the community, it takes an exceptionv
al person to stand up and say, “This is wrong."
And they don’t want to upset the community
And I think that's the way it was with what
happened with Henry’s Turkey [Service].The
people had accepted a condition that was not
good I read somewhere that some inspec-
tors never ever went in there to inspect those
places.

And the apartments in Postville , some
of the ones we've been in, man, they should
have been closed the next day And they didn't
because they didn't have a housing code and
so on. And I think you’d find that all around
the country, especially in small communities.
\Ne've called a number of them, just like us.
[The businesses] are biggei than us, but its the
same Unless good people get together and say
no more then nothing happens.
