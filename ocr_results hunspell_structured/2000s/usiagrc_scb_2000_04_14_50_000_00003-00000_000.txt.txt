encc. The conference. now in irs fourth year, is growing in
both irs scope and parrieiparion and shows healrhy potenr
rial ror growrh in rho ncat future.

The conference, which will be on Apr 20,1125 histori»
caIIy been held during Passover, “because the Exodus Story
is both a paradigm and a meraphor for lilserarion srruggles
orpeople everywhere," Karyn Gibel Azoulcy told she saw
rhiee years ago.

As rhe Exodus srory ean mean something to everyone.
the Africana Studies Confcrcnce cm offer something for
everyone. Thc eonferenee's
arrendanee rares prove rhis.
as more people are attcnde
mg rhe eonrerenee every
year

GlbelAzoulcysays mar find.
ing srudonrs and Faculty ro
presenr papers is rhe mosr
difficult task ofthc confcrcncc. Thc experience is a unique
one, she says; it helps people ger rheir papers “our of rhe
desk" and allows srudenrs ro presenr rheir papers in a unique
inrelleerual armosphere.

This is Sherman's rhird year presenting a paper ro rhe
Confcrcncc; this year he will be discussing his experiences
in die British Parliament and widi other black student or-
gmizations. He seared rhar rhe eonrerenee covers more ropies
rhan one would originally rhink. He rhinks rhar rhe con.
rerenee is a grear way ro ger Grinnellians involved in rhe
Africana Studies concentration, bccausc it shows how much
the concentration Conuibulcs to Grinncll Culturc.

Colin Gurhrie '00 is presenring a paper for rhe seeond
year in a row. curhrie has been raking classes wirh Gibcl
Azoulcy and is already aerive in rhe concentration; he came
baek from a semesrer abroad in Chicago lasr year just ro
presenr his paper. He describes rhe conferenee as “a rime
whcrc we can all sort of touch base" on research that stun
denrs have been doing, and how rhe subieers or researeh
overlap and separare.

Lillian Benjamin '01 is both CXCiICd and nervous about
presenring her third paper ar rhe eonierenee. She was ap
proaehed by oilsel Arouley earlier rhis year ro do a paper
for thc eonierenee Unccrmin ofwhat ro do for a ropie,
Benjamin was inspired ro do a paper on rhe ownership and
representation of black sound when the encountered the
sexism and racism on her visit to the Rock and Roll Mun
Scum in Cleveland, OH. She describes thc conference as a
disnnerive opporruniry ro do researeh. a way ro "evaluare
critical raee rheory and how it can be explored through all
walks oflifc."
