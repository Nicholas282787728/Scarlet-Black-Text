Decision for the best

I will start by agreeing with Matthew Smith (Letter in the
Ediror, 4.27) mat the aurhor or“‘l'irrilar Head‘l‘radirions" should
have gorren more inrorinarion before bringing up we Tong
in his arriele. Thar said. as a former Tiriilar Head Conimirree
member (laekey '99, Head ’00), l supporr rhe 2001 Conirnirree’s
deeision nor to shoiv rho rilrn.

Arrer rhe Committee decided nor to show rho him and

While I feel deeply
sorry for anyone who
believes s/he has
been raped, the fact
of the matter is that
believing you have
been raped does not
necessarily mean you
actually have been,
in my scenario.

Dear Erinnell Smokers,

Because you’re generally kind, educated people,
I’m assuming that you wouldn‘t throw your plastic
wrappers, empty tood containers, and other waste out
on the grass. why, then, is it ﬁne to flick a cigarette
butt onto Cleveland beach or some other previously
pristine(ish) area of Grinnell? There is no reason that
dropping cigarette butts on the ground should not be
considered littering. With all due respect, please put
your trash in those special little receptacles made
just for you!

Sincerely,
Sabrina Ross

Giant ilowers patrol the highways, taking giant
steps and swinging theirenormous heads backin forth
in a ghastly ballet of freakish proportions. rne tower-
ing cities have been reduced to rubble by malicious
bad-tempered creepers and most or humanity has lost
their lives to the RADIOACTIVE PLANTS FROM HELLl
All except tor a small pocket of resistance ﬁghters
that is holding out despite impossible odds against
the evil scourge which has besmirched the entire
planet. ane resistance leader named ‘Divk’ has de-
wsed a plan for ending the oppression of the evil plants
once and for all. Nearly all ofthe surviving pockets at
humanity have united under Dirk’s capable leadership,
winning small wcton'es wherever they can. The water-
dependant plants will never survive once Dirk and his

loyal followers have turned the entire planet into a ,

barren desert wasteland! Mwahahah! Humanity shall
triumph! Down with the.PlantS!
