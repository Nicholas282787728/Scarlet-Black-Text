Paul was also very involved in Ultimate

“Paul was always on the Good team and
he would come In long white underwear, white
trshirt and wear white briefs. He would make
crosses out of sticks and parade around, and
he also wore underwear on his head once," he
said. “He was always coming up with tunny
chants and cheers."

Yet Paul‘s sense of humor didn’t overshad-
ow his kindness.

“I don't think he ever said a disparaging
word about anyone, ever,” Co-captain Noah
Bindman ‘07 said.

“Even In a context where something like
that might be acceptable, he never said any—
rhiIIg bad about anybody," Blndman said.

Paul's intensity and humor also carried
over to his passion for movies. He was I core
member oi the group "Movie Maddncss" and
according to his friend Soleil Ho '09, Paul
liked “terrible movies.”

Many who were close to Paul recalled his
