First, you trip over the broken television on
the front walk Next you get your root stuck
in the remnants of a decaying pumpkin. Then,
when you finally make it in the door, you will
bruise your shin on the dining room table that
dominates the enttnnce. But once you make it
into 1021 High St, or “Xanadu," most people
want to stay.

This is probably due to the warm feeling

house, “We have about three or four nights
a week where we all eat together," said Ben
Klooster ’08. While the residents of Xanadu
have a strong community, they differ from
many off-campus houses in that they were not
a cohesive friend group before moving in to
gctherr

The house formed slowly over the course
of last year, initially starting last spring when
Klooster asked Nick Blencowe '08 if they
should live in a house the next year. Blencowe
agreed, but made the stipulation that Caitlin
Caimody ’08 join lhem.“Cait1in had no idea
he had said that,"said I(.loostet,“she was [plan-
ning on] going abroad, and we convinced her
to stay"

Cannody rejects the notion that the otl‘r
ers “convinced" her to live in the house, Citing
an “existential crisis"and asserted that she was
“above their powers of persuasion." once car-
mody joined the group, Nate Gates and Emily
Reiersgaard, both '08, were recruited as well.

Due to the nature ofthe house formation,
the residents generally spend their time in dife
{erent small groups that ﬁlter in and out, “One
time I was sitting out on the porch, and then
the outside opened,and three people came in,”
said Gates. “Then the inside door opened, and
another five people filed in, and it just went
from O to 60, back down to 0 pretty quickly."

Despite coming fiom different friend
groups, they have formed a tight bond around
their common interests, which beyond an array
of humanities majors, center on quality food,

wine and conversation.

When I entered their house to interview
them, Kloostcr was cooking up a rctiyaki
ehicken salad, Reiersgaard was making cocoa
and soon Blencowe was making green tea, a
common sight in the house. The tea is “just a
ubiquitous presence," said catmody, who said
that she contributes by washing dishes, a hated
chore at the house.

“These big dinners have been one of the
places where we come together the most,"said
Klooster. g

in the spirit of coming together, the house-
mates go around the table and talk about their
"happy moments“ from the day. The happy
moments “are the best part of dinner,” said
Reiersgaard, before singing the Folgers coffee
theme, the “best part ofwaking up."

Beyond happy moments, these dinners are
typiﬁed by rapid paced conversations that ‘ ~
clude many of the housemates’ favorite topics:
patriarchy, the“silcnl matriarchy"postmodeiu-
ism, cxistcntiolism, and the pitch-black room
in rhc basement where they speculate previous
tenants held dead bodies produced from their
methamphetamine production,

While in past years 1021 High St. was
sometimes referred to as “Moth House," the
residents decided to go by “Xanadu” this year,
taking the name from the 1980 cult clas of
the same name, starring Olivia Newton—John
and Gene Kelly in an Electric Light orches-
ua soundtracked disco musical. “These things
should be named organically, like cars and VIA
brators,"addcd Carmody, ‘

In addition to name changes, they have
made additions to the house to change its

“postmodern arr" (a broken television facing
an armchair) and Carmody has a body-tai-

known as the “leprechaun" of the house. But

in this house is that everyone is really kind,"
said Carmody. "You come home, and everyone
