Campus band review: SeptI- Sonick

BY CAlT SCHERR

Tired and burned out, I plodded down the drink
steps to thc Norris basement, expecting my jam ses-
sion review to be another tedious errand prolonging
my already exhausting Friday afternoon, I was not
prepared for the remarkable entertainment of Septie
Souick,a campus band that the lead vocalist,Ted Rev
cio '08, accurately describes as being primarily “funky
metal vibes."

As the group ﬁnished setting up, I positioned mye
selfcomfortably on a large amp, swinging my feet and
feeling mildly like a little kid is I grinned around the
small, graﬁiti-sanirated room, browsing over song lyre
ics and scrawled attempts at profundity. Sitting on the
rumbling equipment and letting Septi—Sonick’s songs
“Without Teeth" and “Zombie Siege" blow out my
eardrnins,1 realized that this was the best start to the
weekend I could have chosen.

Three former members ofthe campus band open
Throat surgery, l<cnny Allison ’07 (drums), Robert
LaFollette ’08 (guitar) and Matt Allen '08 (bass), bet
gan seprieSonick and were joined by Ted Recio '07
(vocals) at the beginning of this year and Matt Moli-
temore ’09 (guitar) a month prior to my interview

Although the nicrnbcrs' interests vary, the group
manages to maintain an impressive level of coopera—
tion.When disagreements about sequence, song titles,
or instrumentation came up during thc rehearsal, the
band members were able to reach compromises almost
immediately. This seemed to be due to the members

shined goals and attitudes: all possessed a valuable
combination orjoirialityr and strong hard rock drive.

The group is also laid back in regards to other de-
tails, like the name oftlie group Itself. When I asked
how it was spelled, none of the members seemed to
have a piererence, and proceeded to have some fun
playing with various combinations, the English major,
Recio, being the only one who expressed any particular
attachment. Unlike many groups who spend countless
hours disputing logistics and analysis, SepritSonick
simply focuses on improving their music.

All the members have extensive musical experi-
ence, including garage, punk, and jazz bands through
middle and high school and a variety otinstrumenrs,
including drums, guitar,singing piano and cello Ihad
inquired about the gioups musical history directly fol-
lowing a song in which LaFollette, as second vocalist,
mide shockingly deep, gravelly noises that might be
familiar to tans of Cannibal Corpse or Dying Fetus,
so naturally his bandniates were surprised when he
told ofhis extensive Violin experience.

Many group members expressed disappointment
in the absence ofa Music House, which, with a lack
of organization among musical groups this year, has
made it more dithcult to find venues in which to prac-
tice and perrorm

The groups goals for the next few weeks are sim
pie: to continue improving their music and to wow
the campus with a performance before the end ofthe
semester.

BY KEVIN MARCOU

It’s taking every inch ofmy willpower to not start this article with “A long time
ago in a galaxy far, tar away..."1've tried altering that famous opening line into
something a little more relevant for an article, but it's just impossible It could
simply be a matter ofﬂow, but my suspicions are that those opening words arejust
so ingrained into my psyche,your psyche, cverybody’s psyche, that to alter them is
paramount to drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa, or playing Beethoven’s Fifth
symphony on your cell phone, That's how much the original S/m' [Mm trilogy
has become a part of our culture. And this year, on the 30th anniversary of the
release ofthe original series, is a better time than ever to reflect on the extent of
the trilogy's inﬂuence.

lfyou’vc been living under a rock with your eyes closed and ears plugged rot
your entire life, the bare bones story is this (S/m- Mir; fanatics might want to avert
thelreyes from the butcher job I'm about to do): In the midstofthe Galactic CIvil
War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance, young farmboy Luke
Skywaller (Mark Hamill) is pulled into the midst ofthe war alongside his mentor
Obi Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness), notorious scouudrcl Han Solo (Harrison
Ford) and Princess Leia organa (Carrie Fisher) against the Emperor Palpatine

(lan McDiatmid) and his right hand man Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by
James Eatljoncs). Both sides make use ofthe Force, described by Obi Wan as “an
energy field created by all living things. It suriounds us, penetrates us, and binds
the galaxy together."

What set the SIM Wm'r universe apart from previous selcucc’ﬁction movies
is the gritty manner in which the world was portrayed, Nothing shines like it
was just manufactured and nobody is either extremely bad oi good. It was, and
remains, a male leallstlc and dark futuristic scenario. The visual and audio effects
were groundbreaking at the time and are still impressive The plot draws lieaVIly
from mythology all over the world and molds them all together effectively Its an
epic story that s backed up by epic effects

Thirty years since that opening logo first tiished upon the screen and sot in
motion one otthe greatest sagas in the history ofmoviemaking, you can watch any
of the old trilogy and think it htisn'ritgcd a day. The characters, the special effects,
the storytelling are all just as pure as they were in 1977. The Force is truly with
these movies.
