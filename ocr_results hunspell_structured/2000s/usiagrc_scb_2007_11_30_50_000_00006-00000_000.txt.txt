Folksy double bill at
Herrick tomorrow night

Midwest natives bring two distinct sounds: one more
acoustic rock, the other with a country~blues vibe

Tomorrow night, concertgoers are in for a
trent. The pairing orMnson Jennings ind Pier
tn Brown at Herrick Chapel is sure to delight
even the most casual folk fan.

Hailing from Minnesota and Iowa, rcspco
rirely, the show promises ro have a distinctly
M i d w e s t e r n
folk ﬂavor. On
record, jen-
nings tends to _.
rock the sparse
acoustic and
drum combi~
nation, ﬂoating
his gentle lyries
over n simply strummed progression. Brown,
on the other hnnd, has a more country-blues
feel to her, with rhe lower end playing r much
more signiﬁcant role.

Expccl n distinct sound from each Liv:
performance. Jennings, who plays with Chris
Mornssey on bass and Dav: King (The Bad
Plus) on drums, tends ro speed things up n hit
and adds a thicker bass line to carry the can,
ceit. On the othcr hand, Brown softens things
up a bit, relying more on her vocals to steal
the show.

Both Jennings and Brown have recently res
leased records. Jennings latest, Boost/riot, was
put out in 2005 by Glacial Pace RcCords and
has since received outstanding reviews, includ-
ing a 3 5 srar review from Rolling Stan: maga-
zinc. The first artist signed ro Isaac Brooks
(Modest Mouse) label Jennings has yet to
disappoint.
