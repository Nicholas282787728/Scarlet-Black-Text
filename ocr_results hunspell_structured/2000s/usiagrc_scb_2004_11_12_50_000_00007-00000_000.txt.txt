William Crosby, who likes to go
by Crosby, is the “Hello Man." He says
hello to everyone he sees, and recently
his sister wrote a song about him called
“Hello, Hello, I'm the Hello Man."

Crosby has lived in Grinnell for 10
years and has immcrscd himsrlrin small
town life, attending cvenrs at the college
four or five times a week and participate
ing in numerous community activities.

Crosby is steadily approaching icon
status in Grliinell, and he agrccd to an-
swer a few questions about how he ends
ed up here, what he likes about Grinnell
and why he doesn’t own a car.

With a farher in the Navy Crosby
moved from place to place for most or
his thPuerto Rico, South Carolina,
Colorado, California and New York.
Eventually, though, Crosby got sick of
the big city life and began to think about
settling down somewhere smaller.

“I wasn’t satisﬁed, and I was tired of
the big city," he said. “But I figured, it's
one thing to say you're tired of sonic»
thing and another to actually think.
‘What do you really want?"

So Crosby started investigating
small towns across the country, trying
to decide which ms the best fit for him.
He wanted a town with a population
or3,ooo-10,ooo poop-16,3 college and a
strong sense of community.

Since he had never lived in the Midst
west, he sent a letter to the mayors or
chambers of commerce of 40 Midwest
ern towns, requesting more informa~
tion.

I—le rcccivcd 30 rcsponscs, but only
seven towns sent personal responses. or
those seven, Grinnell was the only cole
logo in his book of top 100 small col-

leges. He decided on Grinnell, but he
said, “1 ms still uneasy about settling, I
didn't have a job and l was uneasy about
the moving."

So Crosby wnired two years, during
which time he had trouble ﬁnding a job,
and he ﬁnally decided that he needed to
bite the bullet and move to Grinncll.

He put most of his belongings in
storage and took a greyhound from
California to Iowa. He arrived with a
backpack and two duffel bags, nowhere
to stay and no means of earning mon-
c .
y But, Crosby said, “When I stepped
off the bus, 1 immediacely had a good
expcricncc,"

He asked a worns
an for directions to a
motel, and though she
admitted she never
gave strangers rides,
she gave him a lift
rhcrc. Within n week,
thanks to the help of
several people, Crosby
had a job as a school office manager (he
was the first male to hold the position)
and an apartment.

Crosby isn’t particularly thrilled
with his current job at a factory, but he
said that’s not the most important part
of his life.

“My focus in life is not a career; my
focus in Me is more on community and
lifestyle," he said. “My job is simply a
job to have money so that I can live and
not live in rhc park."

One of Crosby’s main hobbies
is participating in community plays.
He has been in over 20 plays since he
moved here, and only happened upon
his first by chance.

“My focus in life is not
a career; my focus in
life is more on com-
munity and lifestyle.”
—Wi//iam Crosby

The
hello
man

William Crosby chose
Grinnell over 39 other
Midwest towns, and
he’s now locally known
for his friendly greet-
ings and presence at
community events

“I had been at the library almost ev-
cry day, and the librarian asked me if]
could sing at all,"he said.“She said they
needed male singers for this musical
they were doing.”

Crosby also helps out with commu-
nity parades, attends college events and
even helped give a tour ora graveyard
for a sesquicentcnnial event.

“There are all sorts or communicy
activities," he said. "Either I go them or
I helpi know one person said, ‘Crosby's
there, now we know we have a real comm
munity activity.”

And that's why Crosby came to
Grinncll. He was sick of the auonym»
ity of large cities because he wanted to

know everyone in
town and say hello to
people as he passed.
There are only two
things that have dies
appointed him about
Grinnell. Onc'is the
weather, because he
doesn't like how hum
mid it is in the summer.

The other is that he’s still singlc.

“My only major regret is that most
females are either already married, her
cause it’s a big family town, or very
young," he said. “i don't think college
girls want to date someone twice their
age.”

And some women tend to balk at
the fact that Crosby doesn’t have a car.

“I rccl that cars our society is over-
domiiiated by cars," he said. “My life
provcs that you don't have to have a car,
cvcn in rural lowa.l tend ro stay in town,
and ifl ger around, us because someone
is going to another town. I have a bike,
but I like walking better."
