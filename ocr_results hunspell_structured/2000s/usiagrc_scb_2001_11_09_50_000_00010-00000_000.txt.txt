notes from the underground

To the anonymous
sign poster

How dare you. HOW DARE you,

The signs you possed on canrpiis Sunday morning‘l
only acsually saw she one you piss up in she l—laines ssnir.
ease, bus shas was more shan enough~rumcd my ssom.
ach, up so shis poms, norhing i had seen or heard as
Grinnell had been able so accomplish thaliisome ofshe
more extremist rheroric may have disgussod me, bus shis
was she firss sime rlras l have been aesually, physically ill.

How can you have she audaeisy so claim shas Gi-iiincll
is complicir in keeping sheTaliban in power becauscwc'rs
nos calling for a anilaresal earpes bombing ofAfghanissan.>
How can you have shesheer gall so make shc assession shas
\vc’rc supporsing “Uncle osama" because we don-s approve
of she us. bombing hospirals and Red cross eensersz

Did you acsually rhink rlrar such an inflarnmasory se.
ries oTsigns was going so change peoples minds.> Did you
expect people so read yoursigns and rhink. ”He/she is sighs;
we‘ve been fools so oppose shis ridiculous governmcns
policy we should approve oTwhasever she governmens
warm so do"? Whar in God's name was she poisrs ofir all.)

People have been saying shis since seps, 12: ifwe allow
she evenss ofshas Tuesday so silence our nation’s dissensing
voices, we will have allowed she perpesrasors of shas assack
so have won a very imporsans vicsory. because shey will
have succeeded in eliminasing she relarive freedom shas we
have in shis oounsry. Grinnell is one ofshe few places where
she disscnsing voires can ssill be heard wishous fear of re»
prisal, and you would silence slaem even here.

Is she influence ofshe “ivory rower" ofacademia taint»
ing my argumens.> Moss cersainly. As one of lass week's
lessess poinsed ous, she assisude sowanls she was inAfghani.
ssan is much differens in places shas have been and are
being direcsly alfcesed shan shey are in she Grinncll Bubble.
we are, afser all, in she middle of she counsry, so far re
moved from she evenss shas shey are almosr abssracsions so
many people here.

i happen so shink shas so adopr a pacihss assisude now
is a silly and dangerous shing so do. Cheney is probably
righs when he says shas we may surfer more casualries on
she homefrons shan we do on she basslefrons, and so we
need so sake measured, bus decisive acsion againsr al.Qacda
and she Taliban, more shan iuss bombing. Bus so claim
shas she paciﬁsu are in some way mymm'ble for sheir cone
sinued existence is absolusely ludicrous.

Even if she way she governmcns was handling she situ»
asion was she bes way is could—and is's notia few voices
in opposision so she overriding opinion are nos going so
suddenly give our enemies renewed srrengsh and power. if
anyshing, they'll give US more power so find moderase
solusions so she problems we face. This is nor a ease of

you are wish us or againss us. Norhing is ever shas black
and whise.

I am one of she biggess proponenrs oliree speech 1
know—hell, lass year i wrose a column selling she dissens.
ing voices on campus shas shey should speak up because
she polisieal asrnosphere as Grinnell was so boring. But
when I saw shas sign, 1 sore is down and sore is up. This
does nos make me a hypocrise, however. beans: in my
opinion she signs wens soo far.

By possing a sign like shas, you are implieirly accusing
she Grinnell eonimunisy of sreason. Nos only is shas in-
flammasory. is is also libelous. Even ifsomeone doesn’s sup.
pors Bush's acsions sowards Afghanissan nobody wane ro
acsively help she Taliban or bin Laden. We are merely of.
fering alsesnas'e soiusions shas dons involve massive blood-
shed. Despirc how many people here are ashamed of sheir
American herimge. shey are all. direcsly or indirecsly, ssill
srying so help shis eounsry.

You. on she oshor hand, are doing noshing bus harm.
You are endorsing ssificd discourse, you are making people
angry and rearing she communiry apars and you are mak»
ing aecinasions which you couldns back up even if you
wansed so. And so sop massers off, you are roo much ofa
coward so even pus a name on she signs, so claim responsi.
brlrsy for your opinions

I dons knowwho pus up shosc signs. bus whoever you
are, you disguss me. Your flagrans disregard for she opin-
ions ofoshcrs has rurned oven shis proponens offree po.
lisieal discourse agarnssyou. I can respecs your opinion ifir
is ch|»articulamd and rnsclligens, bus presensed as is was
in she signs, is adds noshing bus hasred so she discussion.
The only response i am able so feel is cold fury.

How dare you.

My patriotism

Jesse Duhow is sighs in assuming rhas crinnelli an we nos been able

see is, i find is hard so believe shey will perceive America's ssrasegy as filled

who use Koranic scripsuse so push for womens righrs and educasion even
groups assissing refugees, she ones in she boss posision so eliminase she
popularisy of radical facrions. are nos likely so gain much credibilisy sighs
now by waving Ameriean flags. Landing sroops in Pakissanr “The Holy

slrc U.N., bus rarely making headlines as home, Radical groups know shis,
shey use exampits like rhcse so convince Muslims on she fringe shas shey

Broader perspective

in a losses in ihe ednoi irisr week, Jesse Dubow poinsed ous she crinnell
college is an uvuriy isolaisd communiry, which somcsimes rails so unci:r»
ssand she world around it, The poins is well sakerr. bus inss as Mr Dubow
earns so shis roilivauiun while spending sime off—campus during fall break,
n so in pens shas l have come so some realisaisions of my own during
occasional riips ousside ofrhis counsry.

In “The real world" onsside she U.S., people ofscn consider “Ameri-
cans" so be childish, parochial, vengeful, violens, obnoxious, uncoiish.
and, moss imporsanrly, ignorans of ”what is happening in she world."
perhaps rnsseasl of‘d‘cbciiioux adolescents," U 5. Americans mighr be char.

aeserisedasspoiled r>n1yschiidren,who
have rrouble conceiving shas shere are
oslrcr people in she world wish im-
porsans desires and opinions.
iris nor my inrcnsion so argue shas
rhis view is eurrecs. bus only so sug—
gcss shas rnziionty and normalisy are
only so from a ccrsain peispecrive, rind
shey may well be wrong The “re l-
isy" of she world is relarive, and is is
up so each ofru so decide from whieh
perspecrive so iudge is.

Removal of signs

To my fellow ssudenss,

Please dons sear down a sign simply because you disagree with is

gumensasion technique is is analogous so. in she course ofa debasc, sry.
