No one would be surprised ifthe tough economic times

But in the midst of economic cuntt action, Rab—

cd on 4th t\\enlle hctwccn Main and

llighway o, is bucking the trend and planning some maioL

renovations Ln an attempt to attract a larger and more v \f’
icd eiistoinei base.

The ownership tLr Rabbit's Tavern is planning the adtlir
tion ot'a smoke shop, a beer garden, and a sandech shop
The ldryearrold bar, which features a 7
am. happy hour and a patronage drawn
almost exclusively from town, hopes to
Leeuperate some dwindling proﬁts,

“[Ldst fall], business took it serious
dive it was probably one or the worst
years ever," said corowner Debra “ch"
Yaklin. “The combination of the smoking
ban, the high gas prices, and rhe economic
downturn was Lough but we‘ie getting
our busineoo’ back,”

The beer garden will be located in the
space out the door to (lit: north orrhe bar, rhe smokeshop
will be located through another door adjoining the beer
garden, and rhe sandwich shop will be next door in a build-
ing that used to be occupied by a lumber contractor.

The construction of the beer garden is fairly Silnplei

property designated under the liquor license, extends back
to the proposed site ofthe beer garden, allowing parions to
take drinks into the area.

cally gone to two narional conferences, NASFA [National Ase
sociation of Student Personnel Administrators] and ACPA
[American College Personnel Associationl,“ Greene said. “But
what we’ve done this year is we've also gone to Oshkosh, Wis-
consin it’s a huge regional housing placement exchange for
people who are interested in residence life,"

According to Grccnc, the Search has been conducted with
an eye toward speciﬁcally t‘mding candidates who will meld
well with Grinnell’s community and culture. "We're really try-
