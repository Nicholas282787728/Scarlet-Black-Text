Drink lots and prosper

It's not often that a science center dedication finds me sit-
ting crosselegged on the ﬂoor in the very front, a drunk and
swooning fan girl with my mpt attention focused on the speaks
er. Then again, it’s also not often that a Starﬂcer Commander
graces Darby Gymnasium.

I found out that Walter Koenig ’58 (Chekov) would be
part of the Noyce dedication about a week before it happened,
then ran around ecstao'cally telling everyone I knew: “Walter
Kocnig! You know, Star Trek? Nuclear Wesselsl On Friday!"
Then someone gently reminde me of the last thing thatl had
been ecsmtically excited abo 'Oktoberfcstl Amana Colo-
niesi German Beer! on Friday!"

Upon waking up,l found myselffaccd with one ofthe most
difﬁcult decisions I have ever had to make. How could I pick
between it paitywrth free German beer and the fulfillment of
my lifcdong Trekkic status? I asked the Captnin (my room»
matc, Anna), who recommended ScirTrck. But the German
beer called to me and my onlyejusterccoveringefromestudye
iibroadrianerlin psyche. Who else could I ask who would res
ally understand?

suddenly, I knew The man who would only understand
my difficulty. The Ambassador sarek to my captain Spock,
the Admiral Kirk to my Dr. David Marcus, the Worf to my
Alexander, the Number One Dad to my special 12~yeur-old
version of Picard in the episode “Rascals"!

on Wednesday afternoon, I called my Germanspeake

ing, beer-appreciating, Captain Picard action ﬁgureeowning,
Chemistry professor father in his ofﬁce With no preamble,
I posed my dilemma.

“Dad, what‘s more important: Walter Koenig or Okto-
berfest?”

"Both?"

Though he had not ttken into consideration the physical
limitations (my lack of a transporter being one of the most
pressing problems), he vms right! Combining the spirit ofOk—
toberfcst with the ncrdiucss of Star Trek.I Hell,I do that every
week with the StarTrek Drinking Game.

Created sometime second year by the Captain, our friend
Brock (Lieutenant Commander LaForge) and myself, the Star
Trek Drinking Game is an integral part of a Friday afternoon.
The basic rules are simple: drink for awkward sexual tension
(two drinks for awkward sexual tension from beyond the grave)
or when someone who knows the rules better says to.

I don’t remember what episode we watched that afternoon,
but there were enough speeches about humanity from Picard
or badass Riker momeno that we quite happily wended our
way to the Dining Hall afterwards. we took our box dinners
might to Darby Gym and eventually found ourselves right
next to the speakers, less than twenty feet from Koenig's chair.
I have no idea what happened when Koenig wasn't speaking.

When the program was over, it was our chance to ﬁnally
meet him, a man of the stars and the stage. We ran to the
door through which he had disappeared and learned that he
had already left. Disappointed but not deterred, we deduced
that following the line of distinguished alums would lead us
to his next stop, where we sat on a bench outside the Dining
Hall feeling out ofplsce and anxious. We spotted him coming
through the crowd and ran up to him, But now there was a
new problem. What do you say? Luckily, the captain solved
that on

“Hi Giggle. “We’re really big fans."

Quantum of -
’ Solace , '
t. (2008)

After Casino Royals, latest Bond disappoints.

The dominant theme of Quantum 0/50/1115: is revenge, and
the idea makes sense. The 22nd James Bond film picks up not
long after the elegant and crisp Casino Royale leaves off, with
Bond (Daniel Craig) losing his first great love, Vesper Lynd, at
the hands of the mysterious Qlanmm organization.

Curing Royal: was a smart and effective reinvention of the
Bond franchise, and so hopes wort high that Quantum afSo/am
would take another step in the right direction. Sadly, Quantum
is the idea of a great movie, not the execution of one. There’s
something missing at its heart: we‘re left waiting for catharsis
or closure that never comes,

After slamming viewers into the story with several chase
scenes (by car and on foot) that are both unnecessary and shak-
ily presented (director Marc Forster excelled with the poignant
Monster’s Ball, but seems less sure of himself in an action film),
Bond comes into contact with Camille (the beautiful Olga
Kurylenko), and the two team up to pursue the villains on the
typical Bond movie jaunt around the world. Bond is multitask-
ing: tracking down those in Qiantum responsible for Vespers
death while also keeping tabs on the villainous Mathicu Arnal»
do (the unconvincing Dominic Greene).

Amalric wants to buy up desert land in Bolivia so he can

overthrow the government and manufacture a drought so that
he can become the country’s sole water supplier. Camille is
out for revenge for): her family met their ends at the hands of
a corrupt south American military dictator who is also in ca—
hoots with Amalric, Understand? No? Too badiit's time for
another chase scene, this time by plane!

The idea of two grieving people seeking revenge together is
a nice thought begging to be better explored. The writers throw
Camille a few lines ofdislogue to explore this issue, something
along the lines of, “I want to know what revenge feels like,"and
later to Bond, “1 wish I could free you from your prison." But
before we can get behind the attractive duo, something else has
exploded and they're walking through the desert. It's a big miss
that with two ﬁne actors portraying two intriguing characters
with compelling back stories,we don't care about them as much
as we could.

Yet somehow, the principal actors all acquit themselves. We
know what Daniel Craig is capable of as James Bond from Ca-
sino Royals, and so we can give him a pass in Quantum. Cask
no Royalc allowed Craig to show quite a bit of ranghcunning
spy, dangerously physical assassin, passionate lover, wayward
agent, and grieving soul (to name a few). But in Quantum,
Craig is required to play everything so close to the chest that it
becomes difﬁcult to identify with him.

We know logically that Bond is suffering and that his ace
tions are motivated by loss,but the ﬁlm gives him no opportu—
nity to show his grief or to let his emotions go. He does gain
some momentum in his scenes with Judi Dcnch's M, who is as
much ofa boss as a parental figure.

But Dench somehow speaks more than Craig does. It's a
personality bypass, and it‘s a testament to his acting that we
still root for him. It’s also very indicative of the problems of
Qtnntum: not enough heart, clarity, or insight,just a lot ofun-
realized potential.

Editors note: Addressing instances of plagiarism in movie reviews

Last week. a reader emailed the S88 point-
ing out similarities between a review of Tropic
Thunder by Aru Singh ‘09 in the Feb 13 issue
and a review of the same ﬁlm by Manohla Darn
gis in the New York Times.

A comparison showed that the review’s lede
was almost an exact oopy ofDargis'. Singh made
small wor ' changes before submitting his
review, while SSE editors made other minor
changes during the editing process The rest
of the review contained other ideas potentially
inspired by that review, but contained no other
speciﬁc acts of plagiarism.

in a subsequent survey of Singh’s reviews
that appeared in the sen; over the past two years,
similar acts of plagiarism were found. Almost

all of them copied passages from the New York
Timer, with a macaw review and an rmrrormm
user review supplying the source material for two
others.

The reviews containing insosncrs of plagia—
rism are as follows, listed in the order that they
were published; Carina Royals, Knot/red Up,
Tramformerr, Harry Prlrer and tire Order lyric
Phoenix. Mid/lief Clayton, Into TI}: VVIM Fear and
Loni/ring in ZAX Vegan Dynamite Warrior, 21, The
Corporation, Tbe Dari Kn xgdr, and Pineapple Ex—

rm.
1) The extent of plagiarism in each artide
ranged from only a few sentences in some to seve
eml paragraphs in others. Two reﬁeWQ/M-
mill Mniar and Haﬁy Pain-rand lbc Order 0/1170

P/Jami'x—show direct similarities to the Timer
throughout the entire article.

In reviews that contained smaller amounts
of plagiarism, the content closely mirrored the
content of the source materiaL Regardless, it
ms diﬂicult in comparing many reviews to dis—
tinguish the opinion of Singh from that ofthe
Timer’.

As a remit, Singh has been dismissed from
movie writing duties. over the next few weeks,
Singh's reviews will be removed from both the
website and web-accessible pdfisles.

A letter from Singh addressing the situation
appears in this week’s opinion section (see page
12).

The 3‘ij would like to apologize for print—

ing the reviews and regrets that the situation took
so long to surface. Our gratitude is extended to
the student who contacted us about Singh’s last
review.

We try to maintain an implied level of mist
with our writers, one which assumes that plagia—
rism will not be tolerated. But even this is some-
times imperfect.

We wish to reinforce our commitment to
the highest ethical standards, whether it pertains
to reporting, editing, or opinion pieces, and we
will continue to monitor for and communicate
instances of plagiarism in the nature.
