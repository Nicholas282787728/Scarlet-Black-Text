on Monday, computer com
pany Apple announced that it was
partnering with recording giant
Electric and Musical Industries Ltd. .
(EMI) to remove the digital rights min- a ge -
mcnt (DRM) restrictions from all EMI music files sold on
Apple's online music storeThe removal of the DRM controls
will allow customers to copy and distribute the files at will
and that the songs will play on most digital music devices.

The company is finally acting on a call that Steve Jobs,
Apple's chicfcxccutivc. put forth in “Thoughts on Music,"an
online essay calling for the wholesale retrieval of DRM from
digital music.According to Jobs,current DRM protection cfr
fans are not effective against manipulation. He also pointed
to a supposed contradiction in that all music CDs are sold
without DRM encoding. Essentially, for Jobs, the move was a
benefit to consumersThc move was also partly a response to
concerns among some European governments that the copy
restrictions violated EU antitrust laws, as they allowed the
ﬁles to only be played on Apple’s own iTunes sortwnte.

Critics ofthe move claim it is simply to ward ott’ciiticism
of the company's allegedly monopolistic practices. Some, in
fact, say it will improve Apple's business as users ofothct one
line stores will gravitate to the DRMrfree music though they
cost 30 cents more than their restricted counterparts. The
losers, they contend, aic the artists who lose our on loyalties
from the copicd'ﬁlcst

—Cmr1/Iilcrl by David Logan

“As a consumer I like the
idea or being able to share
the music I purchase online,
and the 30 cent pricc seems
fair.

This might be a step in
the right direction. Rather
than outlaw music swapping

“Music.com already does
that, man. But they don’t
have as many labels, it’s not
as good a selection. It's kind
orlame that [Jobs] is chargr
ing more money, 30 cents
more,

 

altogether, the Apple/EMI
deal sets up reasonable pa-
rameters in which fair music
trading can occur,

I wonder irApplc will be
able to track the people sharr
ing nonrDRM tiles. That
could be creepy."

On the other hand, while
consumers have to pay more,
they can use it anywhere...
It probably [has to do with]
Apple facing legal problems

in Euiope."

CD0 trying to up student usage

By ARI ANISFELD

Trevor Sedbcrry '07’5 knowledge of Grinnell’s Career De-
velopment Office (CDO) is limited at best. Sedbcriy said he
has always looked elsewhere for career advice. in fact, despite
his senior standing,whcn asked ifhc had ever been to the CD0,
Scdberry rcplicd “What's the CDO> l have never been there,"

sedberry's response is a somewhat common refrain among
students, Eamon Anderson ’09, who has never been to the
CD0, said he “[docsn’t] understand how it could help [him]."
Students gcncmlly citc‘ ignorance about thc CDO as a primary
reason for not utilizing the ccnrcr.

The lack ofawarcncss among the student body persists den
spite concerted efforts by the CD0 to publicize its activities.
To keep students updated, the staff distributes weekly crmail
updates and posts ﬂiers acioss campus advertising for upcom-
ing resume review sessions and available internship and job op-
portunities.

Some students do take full advantage of the CDO's {6*
sources, which include a vast alumni network and various job
and school databasesjaimie Adelson ’07 considers the CD0
“a life saver."Thottgh she did not use the career development
aspect of the 0mm: until eaily this year, Adclson often visited
the community service center in the CD0 during her sophoV
more year.

This year, Adelson has tnade extensive use of the CD0 in
applying to Grinnell Corps and national scholarships. She also
had her resume reviewed at. the center and participated in mock
interviews. Adclson described her experience in working with

the CD0 as “nothing but a positive experience."

Knowledge of the CDO is still not enough tor some Stu»
dents. Anna Werner ’09 said that even though she has “a vague
idea of what the CD0 does," she still has never Visited it, She
said she felt discouraged in using the CD0 to apply for int
ternships and grants because she thought they were unattainr
able. “The peace development internship [in St. Louis] seemed
interesting," she said. “[But I probably] wouldn’t get enough
money oi.. .wouldn‘t get [the internship)"

The CD0 statti-ecognizcs thit many students do not utir
lizc the center. According (0 Acting Dean for Career Develop
ment be Employment Doug Caulkins Anthropology, student
involvement is so low, in part, because “many students wan until
late in their senior year to think about caieers after Grinnell."
The CDO staff encouiagcs students to start thinking about
their careers sooner.

Caukins said when hi: became interim director ofthe CDO
this past October, his primary goal was “to get students in at
an earlier stage." Part of the push to increase student aware-
ness and usage ofthe center included a drastic expansion ofthc
center's spnng break cxtcrnship programThis year, the CDO
offered cxtcmships at over 40 ditrcrcnt sites in the us. and
across the world, compared to only four m the past. Students
demonstrated great interest in the cxtcrnships and the center
received 87 applications,

Cuulkins also said that the CD0 was tiying to simplify
student access to the center's resources, including enhancing
the website and making most forms and applications available
