LYBW brings the love to your body

5ther BELLo

At this time ofthe year with the holidays and
ﬁnals looming, sometime we neglect the most im,
ponant peison in our lives: ourselves. Anticipation
has bent mounting in the student body for weeks
only to climax with the arrival of Love Your Body
Week(LYBW). Running from Nov. 15 to the 21,
LYBW is hosted by Feminist Action Coalition
(PAC).

Zoe Schein ‘12 and Emma O'Polka ’12 orga-
nized this years LYBW Participating as ﬁrst years
in FAC last year, both were inspired to lead the
group this year and give back to FAC."[LYBW]
is pretty selfexplzuiatory," schein said. “We get a
lot ofmessages about our bodies."

LYBW, which typically occurs in early to
midrNovember, is an effort to misc awareness
about body image. as well as an opportunity to “no
derstand our body's full sexual potential through
our the week Workshops, film screenings and
forums were organized to engage the community
in discussions ranging from masturbation to com-
mon stereotypes pertaining to “fat people."

"Your body is the only home that is consis-

tent throughout your entire life,‘ Sche'tn said.
“[LYBW] is about otploring issues that make us
ﬁght with our bodies, that make us believe our
bodies are our enemies."

Five major events have been highlighted for
the week: Naked Cooking at Eco House, a Fat
Activism workshop, 2 ﬁlm screening of “I Had
An Abortion," the popular masturbation worka
shops and a Queer People of Color (0300
open Micco—sponsoredbyGrinnellMonologues
(GMONS).

This year's LYBWevents are particularly
unique. Incorporating feedback from last year.
PAC hoped to change the breadth and (one of
discussion this year with the addition of a ﬁlm
screening on abortion. In the past, the organizers
ofLYBW believed that abortion was irrelevant to
Grinnell studenu, however, 0’ Polka discovered
otherwise. “Looking at Secrets, people post about
it on (here. People have abortions here.There’s not
aspace to talk about it,"O'Polku said rcfen-ing to a
section ofthe popular cybrr forum,Gi-inncllP1ans.
"We had that event just to have conversation
started but it is something we want to continue

working on throughout the year and in the nitrite."

In addition to providing a forum that dis-
cussed abonion, LYBW also conducted a work-
shops dcsigned around selrabody issues, The Fat
Activism workshop focused on stereotyping and
media hypes instead ofeacing disorders and media
cal issues.

one of the most popular events of LYBW,
the masturbation workshop, was also showcased
this year. The workshops vary Erom year to year
but still serve the same purpose: acting as an open
forum for discussrun of the often mbuo subject.
“People here talk about sex all the time This is
a very hookup culture," O'Polka said. “But we
don’t really talk about havtng sex with ourselves
or touching ouiselveswmt we're doing with our
bodies aﬂ’ecs the my that we view the world.”

LYBW is an ongoing project that changes
each year. FAC appreciates any feedback they re
ceive ﬂom participants in the events during the
week so that they hopefully alrcr rhe events for
next year into more effective mediumsThey meet
on Wednesdays at 7 pm, in the SRC. Feel free to
contact them at [src].

SGA slides
into stride

By Matthew Bncr [TELL

SGA hopes to proinde a better connection
with the student body ofGtinnell this by year
byimpleincnnnoanumbetofchangce to cams
pus community outreach.

in last year’s clccrions for the current
cabinet, held during the spring semester, stit-
governztnce ers a deﬁning focus of the SGA
Election committee in selecting candidates, as
noted in campaign interviews in the Feb, 27,
2009 issue ofThc 5&3,

SGA President Harry Krcjsa '10 cams
paigned with the explicit goal of tackling the
perceived gap of trust between the adminis-
tration, SGA and the student body Krcjsa
defined the idea of selfrgovernance, a tenet
espoused by SGA, as being anchored in such
trust.

“We have started most of the big conver-
sations we have wanted to start, and are now
looking to solicit more from our senators and
from the community to move forward with,"
Krejsa said

Institutional reform was another ofKrejsa's
campaign goals, commencing this semester
with linerbyrline reading ofthe SGA consti-
tution with Reform Committee. spearheaded
by Alex Peitz '10, Student Services Coordit
nator, and Ethan Struby Y10, Administrative
Coordinator, the committee brought the con-
stitution up to date, and to remove errors and
archaic rules. Next semester, alon side student
initiatives, SGA plans on submi ing a list of
constitutional reforms to update.

In her campaign staremenr,ViceaPresident
of Academic Affairs (VPAA) Joanna DeMars
'10 proposed online course registration, and
worked to make changes to faculty orientation
and selection, with a greater focus on faculty
diversityigoals that have not been fully real
iztd yet, but have seen improvements as coma
mittees are being formed to discuss the two
issues.

Another of DeMars‘ goals was to introduce
changes to "classroom and learning spaces" on
campus. According DeMars, by the end ofthe
semester, a report will be ﬁled to Marci Sorror,
Vice President for Institutional Planning, with
the results of investigations conducted this se»
mester, including a photography experiment
by the Student Curriculum Committee to
identify preferred study areas on campus that
will take place this Tuesday.

Demars has also helped carry on changes
begun by last year’s SGA by working to ex-
pand the role of student membership on the
Committee on Academic Standing. Last year,
former V'PAA julie Hoye ’09 achieved two
noi‘rvoting seats for trial student members.
DeMars followed up on this with a report den
tailing those members’ experience, and a pro-
posal to upgrade the positions to include full
voting rights. A final faculty vote is expected
by the end of the semester.

Another perspective within SGA included
Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA)
Ben Offenberg '11, who stated two main
campaign goalsmspecifically, reorganizing
Resident Life Coordinators (RLC) training
and disseminating campus committee‘s infor—
mation to the student body. This year. RLC
training was extended from rhree weeks to six
weeks, with greater emphasis placed on self-
governance in the training process.
