Sideways (

“Best friends on a poignant roadtrip" has run
doubredly been done before, but Sideways is anythrng
but cliché. In this independent film from the director
of Election and 115014! Schmidt, Miles (Paul Ginmatti)
and Jack. (Thomas Haden Church) travel together
through California's wine country while individually
pondering What they should do with their lives.

Jack, a moderately successful television actor, is a
womanizer who hopes to have one last fling before
he gets married, and brings along his friend Miles rn
the hope that Miles will frnd some momentary hap—
piness as well. In addition to being recently divorced,
Miles' dreams ofbeing a writer are repeatedly dashcdr
resulting in a depressed hopelessness that is reﬂected
in every painful expression on Paul Giamatti's face,

Taking off the week before Jack’s wedding to
sample wines from across the region, the intrepid
travelers happen upon Stephanie (Sandra Oh), and
Maya (Virginia Madscn), who happens to be an old
acquaintance of Miles. As the four wine aﬁcionados
start to spend time togethetJack sees several possibil-
ities in the budding friendships hookup with Stephr
anie (without telling her of his engagement), and set
Maya up wrtlr Miles, because Jack thinks Miles will
find happiness in sex. But not suprisingly, it is more
complicated for Miles.

c While it is hard to sympathize with jack’s charac-
ter,Churc|1's performance nevertheless provides most
of the laughs in the film, which are welcome comic
relief from the intensity of the rest of the story. Miles
has clearly hit the lowest point ofhis life and finds the
depression almost insurmountable. We feel his pain
so acutely that, unlike Jack,we end up rooting for him
as he eventually makes the effort to pursue Maya and
get his life back on track, on his terms.

While the characters in the film are middle—
aged, their feelings are universal. In addition to be-
ing a beautiful frlm visually, sir/awayt is a refreshing
truertorlifo story about two friends dealing with their
differences and trying to discover the bestway to find
individual happiness.

Closer (R)

Onepair ofheautiful lovers (Jude Law and Natalie
Portman) meet by chance on the streets of London.
Another pair (Clive Owen and Julia Roberts) meet
thariks to a much more visible hand, Law‘s machina-
tions. But when you look at it, Clam isn't about pairs,
since these four partner up in every heterosexual way
possible, and it isn‘t about love, either,

At least everyone in the cast is beautiful, Filling
out the characters a little bit, Law is Dan, a bored,
struggling writer looking for a good story. Portman
is Alice, a struggling American looking fora new life.
Roberts is Anna, a successful photographer, strugr
gling with her love life, while Owen is a huge prick
named Larry. sea/i movie reviews try to be positive

the scarlet and black

and encourage you to head for Harris because hey,
free movie. Even Tomb Raider DI Blade Trlmry should
dull the pain ofbeing shackled in central lowa. Closer,
however, forces me to change my review policy.

I recently called Clam the worst movie I saw last
year. My exact words were: “the ﬁlm just hates love
and the other siderbencflts ofliaving sex with some-
one. None of the characters were intriguing, and it
maliciously trampled on themes that Chasing Amy
covered so artrtuly."My love of Kevin Smith’s oeuvre
and my distaste of Patrick Marber's script for Clam-
remain.

However, many smart people love this frlrn, Mar—
ber’s script does do some interesting things. It treats
nothing, be it marriage or internet chatrooms, as sa—
cred. Several times in the story there are unannounced
gaps spannrng years which conceivably ‘let the char
acteis mature, but at least gives them dialogue that
confuses the audience.

The most common compliment of q/olcl‘, though,
is it shows what “romance" is today, namely, unro-
mantic. Despite my distaste, I have to agree with this
praise. Jealousy, dcceir, power plays and many other
unscxy things wor-rn their ways into people's love lives.
Still, watching Clolcl' is like watching people pair up
at a post»Hartis party. it may be realistic, but it isn't
artistic.

The Rocky Horror
Picture Show (PG)

Rudy Horror Plain: S/Joau is a terrible, teriible
movre.Anyone who tells you otherwise is either crazy
or lying. The plot is almost nonexistent, the acting is
terrible, the cinematography is cheesy, the script is
horribly melodramatic and the humor is bizalre and
pretty lame. Perhaps if there had been good actors or
sane directors or the writer had actually been going in
some direction, there would have been hope, but the
fact is that the movie is horrible. But really, that's the
entire point

People see this movie so they can take part in the
cultish rituals that have built up around the ﬁlm since
shortlyafter its debut in the 19705. For decadespcm
ple across the country havc been joining on to Rocky
I'lml‘m‘ I’t'rnirt S/mw ”casts," where certain audience
members dress up as characters from rhc movie and
act rt out line for line while the movie is going on.

But chances are that if you go to a really good
showing, you'll nevei actually frgurc out what the ace
tors on screen are saying in most scenes. Rather than
allowmg the horribly pathetic characters to actually
plague the theater w h their melodrama, the audi-
ence puts the lewdest words they can thrnk or in the
characters mouths, rcplacrng lines like “I love you"
with "1 can‘t glue," “hvcrybody’s lucky!" with “The

The audience also tends to ﬁnish the actorsY sen-

tences (“...like your neck") ask questions to which
the characters give responses (“Hey Brad, how doesa
fireﬂy masturbate? ) respond to the actors comments
(“Its not a crime to give your-self over to pleasure!"
It is in New Jersey'" ) and make general running
commentary on the characters' actions. All of these
are collectively referred to as “Callsback lines," and
getting the tinting right usually involves seeing the
movie a few times, especially in, order to do them in
unison as an audience.

And it doesn't stop with just the linesThose who
know the right moments will know when to “climb
that tie" on the screen, get in on the wedding photo,
jump rrp and pick the actor's nose, or flip off God
right before a lightening bolt hits. And of course ev-
eryone will have the opportunity to perform the in-
famous Time warp. Don't worry, the instructions for
the dance are right on rhe screen.1'be key to enjoying
this movie is defrnitcly audience participation.

Don't let the fact that Rarity HDI'Y'OY' is one of the
worst pictures ever made deter you from going to see
it. iryou have the right krnd ofslightly sick sense of
humor you will love it and go back for more next year.
In fret, vaou can tiad a place in your borne town that
plays it you may no see it cvcrv week Just be prepared
to find yourself part ofa unique subculture known as
the infamous Rocky Mount Clowtl.
