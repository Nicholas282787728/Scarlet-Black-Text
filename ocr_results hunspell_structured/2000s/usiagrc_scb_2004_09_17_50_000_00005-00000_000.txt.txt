EXCERPT

"The responsibilities
that were conferred on
us came with greater
and greater risks, both
in terms of means and
results In order to
shoulder them, we had
to surrender ourselves
m ore and more to God
each day, I felt courage
shrinking inside me.
Each day I would scrape
deeper into myself in
search of humility like
scraping the bottom of
the well for a drop of
water only to come up with mud That's how 1 converted all
of my fear into submission. But my fear was stronger, as if my
submission to God had limitations while my fear was limitlessr
I had the extra fear of losing face in front of my companions
and in front ofGod, I submitted myself to Him out of fear, but
my fear was becoming greater, more inﬁnite than God. Why
didn't God feed my heart with enough courage? Why did he
put me to the test of choosing what would be the destination
of my prayers? What was I supposed to submit myself to? To
Him, the Greatest, or my fear?”

The

terrorist’s

Algerian author Slimane Benaissa to explore

the psychological roots of terrrorism

av Clo STANDIFER

Raouf, the narrator of Slimline
Bonaissn’s T/t Lari Nig/l/ uf/t Damned
sold, may be a terrorist and mass mur-
tlcrcr, but he's actually a pretty dccent
guy, He is devoted to his mothcr, loves
his dog and his girlfriend Jcnny and
tries his best to understand his rcligion,
Islam. It’s probably difﬁcult for anyone
to imagine such a sincere, sane person
committing the kinds of atrocities we
saw on Scpt.11,2001,hut that is exact
ly why Bcnaissa created him. The L/rll
Night gfn Dmmizd Soul is Benaissa’s at—
tempt to explore the psyche ofa suicide
bombcriindtocxplain,aslicsaid,“How
the impossibility of
9/11 was possible."

Benaissa takes
an interest in terror
ism largely because
his own life has been
severely affected by
extremism. Death
threats from Muslim
extremists drove him
out of his native Alt
geria in 1993 and forced him to
immigrant population in France. His
situation is common in a country that
saw at least 100,000 people killed rn a
spiral of terror in the 1990s at a time
when intellectuals and performers like
Bcnaissa were often targets of assassi-
nations. For years, Bcnaissa developed
an idea for a novel written from the
pornt of View ofa terrorist in order to
explore the inncrworkings and thought
process leading someone to such an act
of violence but didn’t think the world
would be interested enough to read
it The events of Sept. 11, altered the
literary climate ofthc world and acna-
issa ﬁnally saw a chance to publish his
work.

Bcnaissa identiﬁes himself by his
heritage as not only an Algerian, but
also as a Berber by blood, Arab by
language, Muslim by religion, French
man by immigration and citizen ofthe
world by rosidcncc.1—le said his target
audience is simply “the planet.” Grin-
nell professor Janet Gross, French, be—

access to.

“I think it probably
will be a way to under
stand a certain mind-
set that we don’t have

calm: acquainted wrth his work while
researching the plays of Algerians 1in
ing in exile rn Franco.

“Vthncvcr I read anyrlrrng about
this kind of theatre, hrs name was a vcr y
prominent name,” Gross said. “It would
have been impossible to ignore his imv
portancc." She calls his genre “the the~
atrc of ideas," in which authors try to
addrcss important controversial issues
through the stagc. orrc or his main
concerns has always been exploring rhc
nature oftcrrorisin arid extremism, par-
ticularly in Algeria,

Bonaissa feels the nccd to unlock
the mystery of terrorism’s relationship
to Islam, partially
because it is difﬁ»
cult for him to un-
derstand how some
pcoplc can take the
Koran that Bcnaissa
believes in and turn
it into a war cry.

In the introdut
tion to his novel, he
said, “As for me, ifI
wcrc a contemporary of Muhammad
and I heard him say: ‘Turn your chil~
drcn into bombs for the glory ofGod,’
I would not have embraced Islam" (viii).
Bcnaissa looks at the connection hc-
twecn his religion and Violence through
his book, which contains over 110
quotations from the Koran, as well as
excerpts from other Muslim holy texts
and a series of sermons. The people
who guide Raouf down the path to vior
lcncc are constantly using convoluted
religious arguments But the other side
of the story, the Islam ofpcacc, is also
represented

During the course of her research,
Gross came to know the author per-
sonally. She conducted interviews with
him and saw his work performed in
Paris and Montreal. So when Grove
Press bought the rights for an English
Version of TI]: Lax: Night oft: Damned
Soul, Bonaissa recommended her as a
translator.

Gross said, “it's not something I
chose to do at the outset, but it just

jan Cross,
French

soul

happened.“ Gross had worked with hot
husband, Daniel Gross, French, prcvi~
otlsly in translating the play ,qoraiami
Curfwian by Mohamed Kaciml and
they decided to work together on this
project as wclltThe French dcpartmont
assistant last year, Fransois Massonnat.
also had a hand in the translation.

Gross knew that Bcnaissa wished
to visit the United States and so she
decided to take advantage of the recent
release otrhc book in English to bring
Benaissa to Grinnell. At 4 pm. Sun-
day, Sept. 19, he will read passages from
lec Larr Nigh/ r/rr Dnrrmrd sin]. At
9:30 a.m. on Monday, he will givc a talk
titled "An Algerian Author Responds
to 9711," and on Tuesday at 4:15 p.m.,
he will participate in a panel “mums
mg “Muslim Perspectives of the Othr
er." Although Benaissa speaks multiple
Berber languages, Arabic and French,
he does not speak English; Gross hopes
to use this as an advantage rather than
a barrier to communication. During the
reading, Benaissa will read the passage
in French first and then the passage will
be read in English.

Gross said, “[Bcnaissa] is an actor
and a playwright primarily, so I think
it’s important to hear the passages in
French ﬁrst." For Monday's lecturer
Benaissa will be reading an address
prepared specifically for the event, each
part first in French and then in transla
tion. A similar format will he followed
for Tuesdays’event.

“The idea is to take advantage of
borlr languages and to hopefully ar-
tract enough people who won't be put
off by the bilingual nature or it," said
Gross. She hopes that coming to the
Unites States will give Benaissa a bet-
ter understanding of the country, which
he takes an interest in as “part of the
global experience."

Gross also thinks that an introdut
tion to Benaissa’s work and ideas will
help give Americans much needed ins
sight into the roots of terrorism. She
said, “I think it probably will be a way
to understand a certain mindset that we
don't have access to."

The bands are back!

Finally!

At 9 pm on friday, Sept. 17, Gardner Lounge will
revert to a noisy, crowded, musictﬁlled concert den
for the first time Since last spring. For those of you
who have been waiting for a free rock concert for
four months, your moment has arrived. The bands
doing the honors of opening this year’s line of
Gardner lounge concerts will he the hard rock bands
Engine Down and these Arms Are Snakes.

Engine Down is an unrelentingly angsty hut vo—
cally and instrumentally talented band that hails

from Virginia. In 2000, their debut album Under the
Pretense of Present Tense debuted under the Lovitt
label with a generous dose of screaming guitar and
equally screaming vocals typified by their song
Slingshot. In short, some of it was typical hardcore
punk. Not bad, but nothing too original. But some
softer songs like Brushes revealed the direction
the band would take next: dark, captivating guitar
work, and an attempt at smooth, clear and sorrow»
ful vocals that, with the right sound mixing, could
play effortlessly on emotional strings.

Since then, the band has slowly evolved further
from the hardcore punk scene and more toward a
sort of emu-hardcore, something like Cursive but
with less yelling. Their latest selfrtitled album
released on the Lookout! Label earlier this year has
gone far toward a more intricate and compelling
kind of musical depression. However, occasional

tracks like Rogue still show their "screamo" roots
well enough to satisfy punk fans while appealing to
listeners of a gentler nature.

These Arms Are Snakes, on the other hand, is
far younger. Their first LP, This Is Meant To Hurt
You, came out last fall, and their ﬁrst full length
0xeneers was just released. This is deﬁnitely the
stuff screamo is made of. Aside from loudrasrit-gets
guitar and lyrics that are shouted more than sung,
the band works with a bit of an industn'alrelectronic
edge for rhythms and for filling up lulu in the music
that begs to be moshed to. A couple of softer songs
like Vour Pearly Whites show the band's slightly
less aggressive side, but their specialty is deﬁnitely
loud. While they may someday follow the more-
mellow path of Engine Down, at this point in their
evolution they Show few signs of cooling off.
