you give a microﬁnance loan out, the jobs created help other
people in the community let themselves out ofpovmty,”

“We're trying to prod people into thinking about what

kind ofbusincsses to start on campus." Hudson said.

To encourage small business mdi‘r

Gumball challenge, a terrdily entre
preneurship competition. Teams trill
compete to raise money, which win

small and micro businesses overseas The
most prorttable Gurnballser will win a prize
at the end of the second weekend.

The idea for the Gumball Challenge start»
ed at Stanford University and quickly spread
to other schoolsThc premise is to provide
students with 827 and Z7 guinballs and ask
them to use entrepreneurial skill to earn as
much money as possible, according to the
Gumball Capital website,

The challenge uses the image of a
gumball machine to explain the me-
chanics or microﬁnance, a practice of
providing Small business loans to en-
trepreneurs. “When one gumball goes
down the shoot, all the other gimballs
go closer to the exit," said Greg Hudson '09,

considering expanding the meuuito

and water—and reviving her business
for the Gumball Challenge.

Marion said she plans to run her
taintel stand for an hour or two every
wccknight during the competition, wtth

extra lnte night hours on weekends. The
pinect has made her think about business
in a different wnyﬂvhere to and the best
location, for example, oi whether a falafel
stand could temporarily substitute for the dint
ing hall. Loose Lounge kitchen seems the per
rect location, she said. especially because she
lives on South Campus.

For Hudson and Marion, spreading smt
dent entrepreneurship is essential at a school
like Grinnell “There’s basically an avenue

to do anything you could imagine doing
at Grinncll," she said, "I think it would be
wasteful not to try and utilize this absurd
amount of resources to make the campus

what you want it to be."
“Falafel was pretty much the only thing
I thought Grinnell was seriously lacking,"
said Marion, explaining how she chose her
particular business. “it's definitely something

I'm excited about doing for a whole week."
