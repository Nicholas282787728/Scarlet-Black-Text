Town- -ngow politics

3v AMELIA KOFORD AND SARAH MIRK

Grinnell snidents often feel that they have two
decisions to make before voting in Grinnell elece
tions: first, whether they should be voting at all, and
second, who to vote for. In Grinnell, students have a
right to vote in the town in which they go to college,
but students have to face the question of where they
should be exercising their duties and responsibilities
as citizens.

Answers from the town are varied, but often run
along party lines. Grinnell College is predominantly
Democratic, and many prominent Republicans in the
area and at the college believe students should vote
in their hometowns. Democrats often argue that stil-
dents are as much citizens of Grinnell as anywhere
else. Many students, however, have doubts about what
degree they should be participating in local politics.

Col. Dan Bunnell, chairman of the Poweshiek
County Republicans and the college's director of fo-
rensic activities, said that the college can yield over
1000 votes,while the total Poweshiek County turnout
is usually only 742,000. “That’s a very heavy impact,
and people get disturbed by that," he said.

Jeff Phelps '73, the owner of Saints Rest, believes
that Grinnell students should vote regardless of any
disengagement. “There are people who deﬁnitely see
the inﬂuence that students can have in the election,"
he said. “All I can say to those people is students are
representative of that district, so why shouldn't they
be allowed to vote?"

Don Smith, History, co-chair of the Powcshiek
County Democrats, does not feel that college votes
are creating widespread resentment
among townspeople. “I think those
that are impressed by students take
ing an initiative in local elections
would be more than those who say
they shouldn't have voted,” he said.
People’s opinions about the issue
often reﬂected their own political
motives, he said. “I’ve never heard
anyone in town who didn't have
their own reasons for wanting stus
dents not to vote say that students
should not be voting," he said.

in some people’s minds, the dcbatc comes down
to whether Grinnell students are actually members of
the community and state they now vote in.

Bunnell said that students exercise the privilege of
voting in Grinnell without fulﬁlling the responsibilis
ties of Iowa citizenship, such as getting an Iowa driv—
er's license and paying Iowa income taxes. “if were
encouraging people to say you can have the beneﬁts of
citizenship without the responsibilities of citizenship,
that’s a bad lesson," he said.

Derek Bates ’08, chairman orthe Campus Repubs
l.icans, expressed a similar opinion. “It seems like the
campus only wants to claim themselves citizens of
Grinnell during an election,” he said

are strangers and don't know
much about the town," he said.
“But I think students have a
right and a responsibility to learn
as much as they can about local government."

Some students don't feel the connection to the
town. Kendra Engels ’06 said that college students
should keep out of town politics. “How many stue
dents interact with members ofthe
town other than to order food or
buy a movie ticket?” she asked. “I've
lived in this town for two summers.

dominate those of the town of Grinnell? No, but we
should have a say."

Phelps,who pointed outthat he interacts with over
200 students and townspeople every day, was offended
by the idea of the community divided along ideologi-
cal lines. “It’s really disturbing to me that people have
this idea of us and them," he said, “We're all in this
together. in this community and in this country."

The Democratic and Republican groups on cam-
pus are closely linked to the parties’ county branches.
“We are the foot soldiers, so to speak, of the county
Republicans," said Bates. The campus group looks
to the county party for information about issues and
candidates that they can promote on campus. Buns
ncll has invited mcmbcrs oftlic Campus Republicans
to party networking events, including a talk by Newt
Gingrich in November.

The Campus Democrats attend meetings of the
Poweshiek County Central Committee. which is
open to all county Democrats. “1 don’t think there’s
much distinction made between Campus Democrats
and local Democrats," Smith said.

Canﬁeld said that he was generally in favor of
students voting. "I’m very happy
that students feel enough about
their adopted city, if you will, to
take part in municipal elections,"
he said. “I have a certain amount of
apprehension when an awful lot of
new students get registered to vote
in local elections, but ifa student's

Many students thought the future
of the current form of meal replace-
ment was secure after Dick Williams
visited Joint Board and tentative plans
were made for Crab 8:. Go in the Joe
Rosenﬁeld '25 campus Center opening
next year.

Now, dcspitc a sntdcnt inlliﬂnvc
supporting a Grab &. Go for next year
passing with over 90 percent appIovnl,
the future of Grab 5c Go in its current
form is oncc again unccrtain.

Williams said that he is currently
looking at options that will offer stu-
dents some kind of meal replacement.
“We made a commitment to do some
thing," he said. “We don't know what
that something is going to be.”

According to Williams, a panel that
includes student rcprescntation will

 

 

Ask the Presideni

review all meal replacement options.
SGA President John Bohman ’06 and
Alex Brooks ’08 will work with Wil-

 

 

will return next week on page 2.

liams for a presentation to the Dining
Services Committee in the near ﬁlture.
“[There is] no reason to get up in

arms because we just havent worked
out what is going to happen, said Wile
l.iams. “Right now we have about four
plans that we are considering." He
declined to discuss the details of the
four plans. “As soon as I do that then
it would be in print and everybody will
have opinions,” he said. “Some ofthose
options are just infeasible.”

Though Williams declined to coin
ment on the specifics, Bohinan said
that at this point, the primary Consider
anons deal with which space will con-
tain tlic meal replacement option.

President Russell Osgood has also
weighed in on tho subject. “What we
have said to Dick Williams is that we
would like to keep [Grab Sc Go] func—
tional in the Campus Contcr, then we
can see if students use it or not use it,"
he said.

Williams said he did not know how
the Crab 8: Go would function if it is
not shut down.Again he would not of
fer any details. “I don’t know where it is
going to be,whcthcr it’s going to be the
same format orwhether it’s going to be
some kind of meal exchange," he said.

The Grab at Go opened two years
ago. The original campus Center
plans did not have a scparatc place
called the Crab 8e Co," said Osgood.
“The reason for that was that when the
Campus center was designed, we had
no Grab deco,"

This form of meal replaccmcnt has
proved popular. it replaced the Nortlts
em and southern Epress as a meal re-
placement option.

“I come here all the time,” said
Kenny Allison ’07.“I’m on it 15sasweek
meal plan, and 1 come here like eight
times a week."

But this popularity may not carrv
ovcr once the new dining hall opens. “It
is clear that it is popular,” said Williams.
"At the same time dining hours will
be extended when the Campus Center
opens, so it is not clear to us if demand
for the Grab 8c Go will be the same.”

The future of Grab 8c Go also
directly affects the future of Connie
Coleman, the current supervisor. “This
is the only job i can do,”said Coleman.
“My shoulders have given me problems
since i worked in the college bakery.”
