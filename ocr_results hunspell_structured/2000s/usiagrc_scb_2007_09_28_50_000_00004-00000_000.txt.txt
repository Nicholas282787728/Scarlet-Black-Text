Knocked Up ,
(2007) ‘

in a season ofliigh-proﬁle franchise mov-
ies and sequels, Krwtl‘tn' Up stands out as a
run-of—the»mill romantic comedy, Fortunately,
it focuses less on cotniness and more on one
terrainment, making ‘it a refreshingly decent
movie.

The plot is as hackneyed as could be. Seth
Rogen (a beer-bellied, lazy sloh in his mid—
twenties) and Katherine Heigl (a smart, fo-
cused, career-oriented woman of similar age)
play the load couple of Ben and Alison. Our
leading lady is on the fast track to success,
until she has the misfortune of running into
our hero. Letting her hair down to celebrate
a promotion, his gallantry charms her at a bar
and they go tipsily to bed.They part ways the
next morning in true random hookup fashion,
but two months later slic realizes she is prege
nant and wants to have the baby. How she goes
about it, and how our couple is reunitctl, makes
up the rest ofthe movie.

“Been there, done that," you say? Sur-
prisingly, no. Both lead actors give spontane-
ous performances and share great onrscreen
chemistry, Their linesiextremely banal othe
crwiseibecome extremely entertaining. The
supporting cast delivers the goods superbly.
Ben‘s friends are hilarious, and some of the
scenes involving their idle research into mov-
ie—star nudity tor a proposed internet starteup
are fantastic.

Amid the candid jokes about pregnant
sex, earthy language and promiscuous drug
use, [cracked Up is surprisingly grown-up. It
is a fundamentally honest, family-affirming
picture in which even Alison’s sister’s severely
strained marriage proves salvageahle.

go on too long, Kincaid Ups winning come

bination of benevolence and belly laughs will
leave audiences smiling. In this era of big-
budget movies, special effects, grandiose sets
and mega-sequels, watching a downeto-earth
movie once in a while reafﬁrms our connCCn
tion with this planet. Fine, the movie is loaded
with extra cheese, but at least you come out

Annie Hall
(1977) '

Like Alvy Singer,l luurve Annie Hall, and
I'm an even bigger fan orthe movie she gives
her name to. Probably the besteknoivn work
of the expansive Woody Allen oeuvre, 1977’s
dome Hall depicts the funny-sad complexity
orlove, relationships and life in these modern
times, balancing the self-referential and surreal
with the poignantly realistic.

Ifyou are the least bit familiar with Woody
Allen, then you know what this movie is about
(and if you are not, consider it a perfect in-
troduction): neurotic man meets free-spirited
woman, happiness,dcspair and laughs (both or
thejoyous and more bitter varieties) ensue, But
with Allen,you get so much more out ofwhat
could easily be a rote romantic comedy.

Witty, honest dialogue and satire accom-
pany those themes, revealing the ironies or
man’s relationships with self, significant othe
ers and society-at-large. strong performances
dominate, both from the leadsiwho else
could throw off a Line like “Lil’di’dil,” with
equal parts smallrtown innocent and big-city
blasé other than Diane I(eaton?—and the sup-
porting cast, especially the always-reliable Al-
len sidekick Tony Roberts. The meticulously
chosen jazz soundtrack defines the wistful,
romantic mood, And the Manhattan setting,

When i turned KDIC on this
Wednesday, Dean Martin’s croon-

singers Roy Orbison and Roger

45A|ive, he does
exactly that: bring

’405, ’505 and ’605.
The playlist ranges
from folk-rock like
the Byrds to the
Beach Boys’ California soundsr
Though sometimes the sound
quality is less than stellar (the res

cordings are half a century old),

the Show offers solid chunks of

music without an overwhelming

amount of commentary. 45Alive

is a refreshing sample of Old fa-

Few other movies successfully debunk the

John Rommereim’s ”Convivencia” honors legacy of Martin
Luther King Jr. on 40th anniversary of his Grinnell speech

BY DRAKE BALLEW

Closing out the weeklong Martin Luther
King symposium that celebrates his visit to
Grinncll College 40 years ago will be a unique
musical event. On Saturday Sept. 29, at 8:00
pm, the Giinnell Singers will perform “Con-
vivcncla,” a choral piece written byjohn Rom-
lnCI‘Cim, Music. Tire event will take place in
scbring-Lewis Hall.

in honor or a man who srrovc to bring so
many people together. “Convivcncia,” inspired
by lewrsli, Christian and Muslim traditions.
aims to unify people of diverse backgrounds.
During the performance, members of the dif-
ferent faiths will present readings of various
religious texts. “The music is meant to be noti-
political, a safe space, to gather and appreciate
the poetic traditions from IllCSC faiths," said
Rommcreim.

“Convivcncia,” following King's example.
demonstrates that while we may be different in
some ways, humans almost always have more in
common than not. According to Rommeieim,
the piece portrays “experiences that are shared

’l’tonvivenna’is] norio much a 1‘

by everyone around the globe and across cene
turies: affection. desire, grief and loss."

By using these experiences as “connecting
points," Ronimereim hopes to help people see
one another on equal terms. “The intention
of the piece and event is to bring people to-
gether," he said. “it's not so much a concert as
a bringing ofpcoplc together."

For Rommcrcim himself, organizing the fie

“Because it has put me in contact with a lot of
people in groups who I wouldn't have been in
