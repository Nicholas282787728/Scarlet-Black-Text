As long as i live on campus, i am rzquircd ro have a dining plan

iins been no change in this policy. iguess my nurriiion is nei one of
rho "Feasible” suggesrions iiinr dining services sees as to inipieineni,

Vegans nre nor rhe only ones suiiering eirher. vegnns are given
riie usual “why am yeu jusr car mm?“ suggesrieii from use incrcds
ibiy concerned sriidenr boriy, hiir people rhar nre incrose iiiroiernne,
or have religious diernry iesrricriens have lirrie choice in riieir eeiing

Besides riiis ineredrbiy huge issue of hungry srudenrs dizt are
iorccd re pay for feed shnr riiey edn‘r {an i also take issue ivirh oriier
dining services policies. The Expresses, which "benenr die sruderii
body grcnrly,“ are perfect monopolies for rhe snack food indusrry.
Besides evereiiarging forcmpty calories, rliese oheoeonvenienrsrores'

Think about all the stu-

cost effective to feed the
