Grinnell’s den of
secrets explored

Lorin Ditzler ’06
Mounting the [noel

Since our fateful meeting at Montgomery’s Maid
Rite, she has haunted me. Around every corner she
lurks. At every encounter she smiles, exchanges pleas-
antries, as if she can mask her true nature. -Finally I
can bear the mystery of my 80ryearrold nemesis no
more. Why is viverly set against me? Why her con
stant attempts at sabotage? I want answers, and I
know where to find them.

Shortly after 3 pm, I stroll up to the Grinuell
Historical Museum, marveling at its allrtoorconr
venient ability to blend into the residential milieu.
Theyie trying to hide something in there, and I in-
tend to ﬁnd out what it is. My COTCOnSplmlOi’.N11“)?
has come along as back up.

The sign claims, Were open yet the front door
is inexplicably locked, and my i‘ervtnt knocking goes
unanswered seveial nnnutcs drag by. An elderly cur
rator ﬁnally comes to the door, taking his sweet time
unlocking it in what I can only imagine is a frantic atr
tempt to stall my inevitable investigation of this house
ofsccrccy.

As I make my way through the museum, I note
the intricate familial shrines made of human hair,
cross-shaped sugar cookies laying on a 19th century
stove, a silent piano, a newspaper from the day ofLine
coln's death and a mustache cup, with a special rirn
designed to keep one’s stache out orone's tea. on the
bottom ofthe cup is an inscription: to Russ, love CG.
Intriguing.

Impressed but unsatisfied I head upstairs. The
curator shifts nervously but says nothing. He follows
a few paces behind, silently. Suddenly, in a flash of
vivacity the elderly man bounds over to slam a door at
the end of the hall.

“Everything alright?"

“Nothing to see in there, ma'am. Just some dusty
old brickabrack and such. Have you seen the sun
porch?"

As he attempts to force us to the other end of the
house, I hide behind a large wire mannequin while
Mary distracts the unwitting curator. Stealthily, I
creep in to explore the room he’d been protecting so
vigilantly.

It seems at first that the old man was telling the
truth. The room is dusty, dimly lit and strewn with
hooks and papers. But I am not fooled. I begin to
search. I don’t know what I'm looking for, but as it
turns out,I don’t have to look long. The tattered pho-
tograph catches my eye almost immediately

As my eyes adjust to the light I begin to recog—
nize, o0 years younger but unmistakable, the race of
Viverly. Next to her, a young man. His long hair,
short moustache, and serious face seem oddly familr
lat. He appears to be ...Argcntinian, perhaps. Iread
the faded writing scrawled across the back: “Weekly
meeting of the Rochester Kalediseope Organization,
VL and CG."

Suddenly it all makes sense: the moustache cup,
the inscription to Russ from CO, the Rochester
Kalediscope organization, and Viverly Luther in the
nliddle otit all. As a young girl in small town Iowa,
Viverly was always looking for excitement. She found
it in the form ofa whirlwind affair with an Argen-
tinian lover, CG, better known to the world as Che
Guevara.” Alas, duty called Che back to his home,
but not before Viverly discovered that she was about
to bear a son.

As loyal members of the Rochester Kalediscope
Organization, the two decided to name their child in
its honor: RKO, Russell K. Osgood. Since Che colild
not stay to raise the child he left for him his most
prized possession, his moustache cup Now Vivcrly
tries to hide the affair and her connection to RKO,
engaging in blatant sabotage or the college, its stu-
dents, and their spry leader. Eur it is all in vain.

Oh no, Viverly, you can’t hide your sordid past
from me. Atrer all, I‘m an English major. As the cur
riitor escorts me out ofthc museum, I thank my liberal
arts education for my unfailing analytical prowess.

The U.S. Congress should support
the president’s plan to develop
lndia‘s nuclear program

In the broad sense, the case to enhance American relations
with India is an easy one to present. India is the world's largest de-
mocracy and creating such an alliance would be strategically ben-
cﬁcial to the US. for both military and economic reasonsThus.
the motive for forming such an appropriate alliance is obvious.
But, the critical word here is appraprl'nrc.

Just because forming an alliance could be beneﬁClal for Ame -
iean interests does not mean that the U.S. must agree to any alllr
ance the Indian government desires. congress must not support
the agreement as currently proposed by the president. The U S
should not settle for a seconderate nuclear deal that primarily bane
eﬁts Indian nuclear interests while its claimed beneﬁt of nuclear

nonproliferae
tion is super
flcial, if not
wrongeheaded.

In reality,
the agreement
jeopardizes the
illrcadyrwcak
Nuclear None
proliferation
Treat (NPT)
by essentially
offering India
all the beneﬁts

. that the SlgT
natories enjoy without having to sign it and abide by its major
obligations.

India can continue to develop nuclear weapons, and as many
nuclear weapons as it likes, while it will now also be able to access
nuclear fuel and nuclear technology for energy purposes.

This deal has forsaken the original principles of the NPT by
embracing a state that ignored the treaty for decades and tested
nuclear weapons, thus increasing nuclear proliferation. Instead of
convincing India to give up nuclear weapons or at a minimum to
stop building these weapons, the us. is olrering up the techno-
logical benefits previously reserved for those states that signed the
treaty and embraced nonprolifemtion.

The only stipulation placed on India is to have its 14 “civilian”
reactors subjected to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s
safety inspections while its eight “military" reactors remain out-
side the scope orthese inspections. This is inane since the very
purpose of these safegiatds is to guarantee that states are not pres
cessing nuclear material for military purposes.

' While the NPT is far
from perfect, the Bush ad-
ministration’s foreign pol»
icy should be built around
strengthening the treaty and
the nonproliferation regime,
not undercutting it further
and decreasing global stabil
ity,

What kind of example does this set for others outside the
treaty, like Pakistan or IranPThis deal sends the message to other
states that they can remain hostile to the treaty and yet they too
may one day receive the same exceptions and beneﬁts without
ever complying with the treaty Are we not merely just encourage
ing the continued spread of nuclear weapons under the guise of
alliance building?

Bettering relations with India at the cost of world nuclear sta-
bility seems frivolous and shortsightedwe are selling the barn to
save the cows.What good will a strengthened alliance with India
be when such a ﬂawed agreement could also possibly set off a
dun erous siral of nuclear arms Iroliferiltion around the lobe?

Are we normere/y/usl
encouraging the continued spread
afnut/ear weapon: under the
guilt? vial/lame bill/ding?

Today I gave a tour to a high school ,unlor re~
stricted to it wheelchair and was extremely embar»
rassed for Grinnell. Nearly halfof the tour had to be
altered because this school’s buildings are not compli-
ant for handicapped students. As much as I admired
this student‘s enthusiasm and strength throughout
the visit, I was silently hoping that she would go to
a school more willing to welcome handicapped stun
dents.

How hypocritical that we pride ourselves on be-
ing an accepting community while leaving a percent-
age ortlie population entirely in the dark, Why are we
so obsessed with being understanding about others’
ideals and rights while we will not even allow some
people to cute! into our buildings? t
