The fun balance, 01' the fund balance?
Sometimes it can be tough to tell.

It involves lots of money, which is fun. but
it also involves par

paperwork. Not
fun.

Here's rhe good
newwthere is a
lot of money at
Grinnell College
waiting for you to take advantage ofit. (And
not in the Gerbilfest kind ofway.)

For starters, we need to talk about how you
get money from SGA.

Each semester, one ofthe first things that
Joint Board does is to vote on a proposed 51:»
mester budget. They look at what each divi-
sion (like Concerts, ACE, SPC, and others)
has received over the past several semesters,
and what they are allotted for this Semestcn
These amounts are in the tens of thousands
of dollars

Now that SPC (the Student Programming

have a budget, they‘re ready for yours.

If you want funding for a club event, you

anything that is

ACE. In both cas—

es you must have a budget that has all ofyour
expenses itemized.

Though friendly, committee members will
expect you to be able to defend your expenses.
ifthe approved budget is over 3500, then you
will have to go to Joint Board that week and
present your budget to them as well.

Finally, once you have been approved you
will be reimbursed by our beloved Treasurer
Emily Wax ‘09 ror the amount you were hud-
geted.

Disappointingly, this means that you aren't
handed stacks of cash,

This is where the magical 3500 figure
comes in, but it isn’t so mystic at all,

Now for the kicker. Most semesters, the
SGA budget runs in rhe blacle Why is that,
you aslt.>

Well. it is almost entirely a result of ACE
and SPC approving budgets for student groups
that go unspent.

Say that Water Polo IS allocated $3,000 to
buy a golden, gem-encrusted water polo hall.
Even though the money for that ball has not
been spent, SP0 is now operating under the
assumption that their budget is less three

thing we call the “Fund Balance." But
please, whatever you do, don’t call it the
slush fund.

The leftover money cannot be directly
accessed, but is instead there to help balance

the budget when ‘it does run over the allotted
amount,

What this means is that SGA cannot
cut you a check for an El Camino with a hot
tub on the back, but if you start car club, get
enough members, and apply for rho funding
for aforementioned El’cilman’Vvlth’POOl,
spc can approve it.

If they also approve other budgets, which
rhey hopefully will, and run over, the treasurer
will go to the fund balance to inalte things
right.

The fund balance

- is not a roduct of

that Water Fri/0 l5 SGA not? spending

money on students. It

is, mostly, a result of

students not spending

the money they are
given.

The takeeavvay les-
son here is: apply for lots of money, get most of
it, and spend it all! That’s the fun part ofthe
balance: spending.
