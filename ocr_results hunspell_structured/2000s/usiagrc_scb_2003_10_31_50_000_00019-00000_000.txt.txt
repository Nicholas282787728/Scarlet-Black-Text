When Griiinell women’s soccer hosts the conference tournament this
year, any or the tour competitors oottid walk away with the automarie bid
to the NCAA Tournament. But ihe Pioneeis, Conference champs for (ll:
regular season, have already proved one thing. They‘re clutch,

from back-to-hack noneconfcrcncc losses to white-
wash Carroll and Ripon and clinch the conference
erown.

”Thcwomen should be commended for their per-
Formuncc against Carroll," said llCald conch Heather
lienning. “There was a lot or pressure on them and
they eonlein't have put togethera hater game it was
a thrill to watch . they are so talented"

Grinnell (10754, 87071 MWC) not only beat its
last two tnnretenee roes, but dominated each game

Pioneers, on Oct 25, Rachel Moskowirz ‘06 had two
goals and two M5155, while goalie LiL Carrier ‘07
turned bad: all eight shots she faced.

the next day against Ripon, Moskowlrz had two more assists in the
ﬁrst six minutes. Both went to Samh Evans ‘05, who ended up with 2 hat

allow the Red Hawks : shot on goal, and the Pioneers outshot Ripon 587

“We knew our competition was prettystroiig, and so we knew that we
had to go into the games with a lot orintensity,“ and defender Julia Brud-
ley-Cook ‘06. “We were able to do that, and I think because of that we
were able to win by so mueh. But it eould have gone a eornpletely differ-

Women's soccer isn’t the only team
entering a postseason weekend

Women's soccer is hosting the conference tournament
on its home turf this weekend, but three other teams will
have to go into hostile or neutral environments. Men's
and Women's Cross country travel to Lake Forest, IlL, to
run at the conference meet, while the Grinnetl water
polo team is on its way to Nationals this weekend.

Water polo ﬁnished second in the Heartland Division
with a 10 reeotu this year, behind only St. Marys.
Theyll join eight other teams in Bowdoin, Maine, in a
two-day tournament that will decide the Division III
Champion. '

“We're hella dope." said two-meter defenseinan Ari
Hart '04 on the team’s prospects. “Nut said."-

In cross country, the men are once again heavily
favored to win their 17th conference title in the last 18
seasons. Excluding a blip in 1996, Grinnell hasn’t lost a
conference meet since Ronald Reagan was president and
the chiesgo Bears were recording the ”Super Bowl
Shufﬂe," The title defense will begin at noon on
Saturday,

The women’s team hasn’t won a conference title since
’95, and ﬁnished ﬁfth last year, and theyll be running
without the services or Kaitlyn Ryan '07, who is injured.
Still, they have reason for optimism after a strong
showing at Lora: on Oct. 1 The women race at 11 am

“We’re thinking that thi s when everyone’s peaking
during the season, so that’s encouraging," said Paige
Wheeler ’07. “A Lot of people feel thejre ready to break
through in their races. 50 even though we have some
injuries, 3 lot of peoples' training is ﬁnally peaking.”

And just in ease you can’t get your Pioneer postseason
fix, women’s volleyball goes to the MWC Tournament in
De Pere, Wisc., next weekend on NOV. 7-8.
