An unruly party hrorrght crinnell police ofﬁcers to
campus sarurday night at the reeprcst orcoilego start, who
had been unable to convince students gathered outside
Younker hall to move Indoors.

The gathering was part or who, a progressive drinlt.
ing party thtt liegen ouurde Norris and ended in Gnrdner,
with stops in caret anti Younker.

According to Associate Dc1n ofSttidunt AIEtiis SICVC
Larson, security omeerspnssirigvoiinltereirrrrngtheir regu—
lar rounds saw ahour i so people standing near the hall
some or their. were diinking, rn violnrron ora city law
against consuming alcohol outdoors

The security olﬁccrs contacted two RLCs, Tlm Boslcr
and Jennifer Grecne, who “spent about ten or 15 minutes
trying to break it up, trying to get everyone to move in»
side." Larson said. “Them were so many people, and itwas
so loud, that it was really hard for them to get stridents'
attention."

in keeping with the policy orselrgovernanee, Larson
said that Bosler and Greene tried to get SAs and Hscs to
help, lint students ignored rhern as well,

students were also smoking mariiuini, prompting the
Rl.Cs m enll the orinnell Polite Department. “There‘s no
tolerance {or illegal drugs.” Larson said. “iririy stalrsees it,
rheyre going to deal with n I heard that there were pipes
herng posed around, and the smell ormariiuana was all
over the place lr wusnt like students were even being dis.
ereer shoot it."

According to parry otgmnchr Ben Weiss ‘02, police or.
ﬁceis walked through the party end into the hall, did not
smell any inanitrana indoors, spoke lrrreﬂy with Weiss, and
left,

“I ind the impression that none or them really wanted
to lie mlled,” wcisssnid.

Weiss, who is n trarned server, said the petty atYounkcr
was nrrr according to the nev oleohol poliey. Although
organirers ran out orwristliinds, “itwas either show nwrist.
hand orrn ID at the leg,“

Both Weiss and Larson described interactions between
sludclm, SHE and police as cordial. Just before leaving.
Weisssaid one other walked up to hrs partnerand said
we need to get out or here and let these kids have their
hrrrx"

Larson srid ehnt large parties are often dilrrcult to mim-
age, and that the police recognized Weiss had done his ioio
to ensure compliance with college policy. “The police talked
to him. nnd rhe police were very satisﬁcd that he had done
everything he could do," Larson said.

Although nicohoi polrey ehsngos corrsed some confue
sion earlier this year, Weiss said the RLCs told irim that
“this {was} :xactly how the policy is supposed to work.”

Most students left Younker shortly after the olricers
arrived,‘ People have a tendency to move nthcr quickly
when poi iee show up, Larson commented.
The party continued in Gardner where there were no prob
lems heeause Gardner is large enough to accommodate
more people than Younker.
