Pomp, circumstance'and
pompous circumstance

One month here and I’ve decided the one
thing Britain has over the U.S. other than really
cool accents and Colin Firth is the monarchy.
Granted, it is a constitutional monarchy that
doesn’t really wield what little power it has, but
who could possibly deny how cool it would
be to have a queen, crown jewels, and hunky
Prince Charmings for real? Not only that,
but think otthc royal palaces, ceremor
nies, and great songs like “God Save
the Qieen'x.

Royal Palaces: While we have
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the
British monarchy has a good
handful of palaces, many or
which are now national mu-
seums full of royal treasures
and really great stories about
the not so perfect lives or
the monarchs. One such is
Hampton Court, “given" to
Henry VIII (you know, the
one with all of the wives) by one Cardinal
Wesley (I say “given” because Cardinal wo-
sley lost favor with the king when he didn’t
want to grant his first divorce, which rather
pissed Henry off, and since he was the king
he decided he needed a new palace”). Henry
vamped it up a bit, and so did his successors,
and eventually the monarchy decided it was a
bit drafty and apparently haven’t lived there
in a while Instead, restoration experts have
spent time and money making it educations

ally presentable so that groups like the 20 or so

Grinneilians last Saturday can descend upon

it and take audio or guided tours of the state

rooms, kitchens, and gardens—which include

a real hedge marel (Ifyou want to read more

about our adventure, turn to a Day in the Life

on page 9). And ifyou are geek, like apparently

more than myself are in the group, you get

a real thrill out of seeing Queen Mary's

bathroom laid out, talking to the cor

tumed actors wandering the gardens,

and hearing about King William's pos—

sible homosexual relationship with a

young courtier. The kind of history

you don‘t get in books.

Ceremonies: There are too

many to name, but the one most

everyone seems familiar with is

The Changing of the Guard,

which has been occurring for

ages outside of Buckingham

Palace (my, another palacel).

I won’t bore you with the details you can get

out of any guidebook (i.e. time, place, blah blah

blah) but 1 will say that, ifyou do happen to go,

unless you happen to get a perfect view, don't
expect much.

The police won't tell you winch mic they
will be using due to “security," but even if you
are lucky like we were, you’ll really only see the
New Guard march in playing fun band mu-
sic and wearing theii nifty uniforms with the
tall bear skin hat (these are the same guards

 

that stand outside the palace like statues and
tourists gawk at and make fun ofjust to see if
theywill movc).1t's cool, it's something to see,
but personally the real gems were the police
ofﬁcers.

Tourists begin arriving at the palace over
an hour before the ceremony begins, mwke
ing, taking pictures, and being tourists, but the
ofﬁcers are nevertheless brilliant at sounding
nonchalant and not overtaxed when they say
repeatedly to tourists that they cannot stand
in the middle of the road leading into the gait:
And, iryou're as lucky as we were, you'll get a
new ofﬁcer to the post who, despite attempts
to plaster his face with boredom like his sup?
riots. is just as excited about being at the a”,
cmony, even iflie does have to deal with some
rather dumb tourists,

“God save the Queen”: Okay okay, we
have a song that hails oui leader, but it is only
two lyrics longl And as far as I know, the sex
Pistols have not done a cool anti-regime, punk
version ofit. Ergo, “Hail to the Chicf"dccsn’t
cut it, especially when the majority of the
world would rather not hail our chief.

I'll admit that it is really just the novelty
that I’m attracted to in Britain’s monarchy.
Palaces and ceremonies and songs can be a bit
overrated, which is obvious when the people
that go gaga over them here aren’t the Brits but
the touiisrs. Nevertheless, you’ve got to admit,
that whole Piincc Charming thing wouldn't be
halfbad.

 

 

B StaH:

h“ Editorial

 

Loving broken bodies

It‘s Love Your Body week And hen: at
the S88, we have bodies (not to mention
brains). And, well, some of us have diseases
in those bodies. Chronic diseases. Bad stuff
that shouldn't be there but that just won’t
go away (like CocarCola). Wei-e a mini—
epidemic housed in a small odcliy hexagonal
constructional protrusion called the Student
Publications Building. But technically our
maladies are not contagious. What’s con-
tagious is the support we've each received
from our fellow students. Every week, we
Love our Student Body.

Please note: This editorial in no my ads
dresses a global or political issue. But, Lov-
ing our Diseased Bodies is important to
us and important to the many other non—
newspaper-staH-students with health issues.
We‘re devoting this editorial to health not
because we are the best examples of how to
Love Broken Bodies or because we think
“out diseases are so much worse than yours,"
but rather because in addition to being edi-
tors, reporters and photographers (oh, and
students in our spare time) some ot'us have
to remind ourselves to take care of bodies
that don‘t take care of themselves.

These conditions and syndromes affect
how we do out schoolwork, how we party
and how we contribute to the campus, It‘s
okay to play uttmh'wi ta your health. In fact,
it's literally an issue oflife and death (weird
as it sounds and hard as that is to face
when you’re all under the age of22). Holdr
ing yourself accountable for your health is
a huge deal And we want to express how
helpful the newspaper staff and the entire
Grinnell College community has been in
ﬁghting our body battles. in our experience,
the truly corporeal aspect of self-gotten
nance—the governing of that bundle of skin
and bones that holds up the selfin space—is
successful at Grinnell. It’s a blessing to be
surrounded by students who so generously
transfer their intellect and enthusiasm toe
ward understanding and supporting medical
idiosyncrasies.

We're diabetic. We've got lupus and kids
neys that don't funco'cn correctly. We’ve had
brain tumors and seimres in the shower. At
times it seems easier to pretend that symp—
toms are merely "suggestions" that we can
choose to take seriously, but luckily, the peo-
ple around us remind us how crazy that is.
We love that people at Gtinnell care about
our bodies, whether they’re healthy or not.
If you think it’s easier to ignore your body
when it's cmmpl'lng, give a friend a nudge
and tell them you’re thinking about avoiding
the messages your body is sending you.Your
friend should then hug you and make you
pay attention.
