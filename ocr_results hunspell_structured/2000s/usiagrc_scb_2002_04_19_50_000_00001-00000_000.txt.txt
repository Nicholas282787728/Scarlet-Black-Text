“It was a job interview," she said, “but it deﬁnitely didn't feel like that

After last Monday, discussions took on another level as some joint

committee member, speaking on condition oranonymity. suggested that
the complaints had been propagated bystudenss whose opinions had been

Assassins fever sweeps campus

Mark French ‘03 met his demise when he
bent over to inspect a Wal-Mnrt bag full of
swordfighring supplies and his friend shot him
in the back ofthe neck

A fire alarm ln Read drew Matt Wilson Y03
out into the loggia, where hewas ambushed and
killed.

And Adam Portilla ’04 died when he
dropped by his girlfriend's room before the Mary
B, James costume ball and she shot him in cold
blood.

They were assassins. They set out to be kill.
ers, but sooner or larer it had to happen.Through
chance. dewit, or persistence, someone got the
best ofthcn-i

Fortunately, it was all a game. A big one,
organized by Paul Carlson ’02 and Jessica
Shireman '03. Participants are each assigned a

target, who they have to stalk and try to “kill"
with a water gun while simultaneously eluding
their own puisucr.

Fred Beukema '01, who coordinated the
game last year, doesn't know when the tradition
came to orinnell, but the game is a narloaal
phenomenon.

“It lussorr ofan urban legendy Feel to it, the
way its spread around the us. over the late '90s,"
he said.

The game has evolved over time, with new
rules being added when the need becomes ape
parent—players rooms were declared salezoncsr
for example. after Joe Moon '98 got a reputa—
tion for sneaking into targets rooms and wak—
ing them up with a flashlight and a gun in the
face.

The evolution continued rhis year when
Carlson decided to trysomerhing new: team as.
sassins. players sign up in groups of four. and

she teams hunt each other. This semester. instead
or being a 24/7 affair, the game is only in session
on weekends. When three members ofa team
get killed, that team is our ottommlsslon.

lfa team successfully rubs out its target, ir
then goes after whoever the team it killed was
supposcd to be hunting.

Some players go all out in this game ofkl‘llr
or.bc.kilkd. "lfyoii'te really serious about it, you
start checking doorways, getting your friends to
walk into rooms first," Carlson said.

Last year, Shlremtln evaded an assassin who
was hiding on the roofofthe Yollnkcr Memorial
Computing Area by switching hats. coats. and
backpacks with a friend,

Shireman could also be seen ”tagged up in
black cloths and black racepainr to do some night
hunting," Beukema said. Two reams remain in
this semesters game. Organizers expect a winner
to emerge this weekend.

Trustees agree to
code of conduct

Anti-sweatshop group cancels
protest, celebrates ‘one victory in a

Members of the Grinnell College Board of Trustees
signaled their readiness ro adoptaeodeofconduct on swmte
shop labor, Grinnell College studentsAgalnst Sweatsheps

said last night,

Leah Bry ’04, Shannon Heffcman '04, andian Morrill
'05 joined SGA President Paul Ford '02 in his ofﬁce at 4
pm. yesterday for a conference call with Trustees Russell
Allen and Caroline Little, Dean of students Tom Crady
also dialed in for the all,

An sol; reporter was present at the beginning ofthe
call. but left because Little objected, saying she was un;
comfortable with the conversation being public record. lri
an email sent while the call was still in progress, however,
she dueribcd the talk as “a fruitful conversation.”

When the all ended. students and trietoes had worked
out a code of conduct that appearcd likely ro meet with
both groups approval. The code lays out acceptable Stan»
danh and practices for vendorswlth which the college does
business

studena made a number orchanges to the code they
had originally proposed. Manyofrhe changes were minor;
: few represented compromise on items that l-leffernan
said “weren't things that were strategic to argue about it
this point in our battle."

The ﬁrst compromise was narrowing the codes focus
so that it only addressed apparel and footwear. A previous
draft had used broader language setting forth requirements
for manufacturers of”apparel or other products."

students also agreed to remove the stipulation rhar
manufacturers not require employees to work more than
as hours per week, instead saying that employees could
nor be forted to work “to a point that is physioilly and
menoilly unsustainable. "

Helrernan said the discussion took a step forward when
mistress realized that daestudents' goal was to reform sweat.
shops rather than shutting them down.

“I feel like we've said it time and time again, but this
time is clicked," she said “Thatwas inst a bigcommunlca»

The students had planned to stage a weekendrlong
