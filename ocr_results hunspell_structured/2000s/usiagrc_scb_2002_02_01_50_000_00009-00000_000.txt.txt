Right. Affirmations ofthe opinion columnisruidc, it's
fairly obvious that anyone involved with this whole Enron
finaneial seam either is screwed or will be in the near fu—
ture. Eetween Arthur Andersen shredding finaneial ieeoiels.
foirnei highelevel Enron execs eommitting suieide, and evi.
denee of Ken Lay's personal finaneial improprieries, the
whole affair was only not a total testament to our eounrrys
pluteeraey betaiise the people responsible appear to have
gotten eaught.

oreourse, George w “Man orthe People" Bush has
repeatedly denouneed the Enron cxccurlvcx’ shady ptae.

As originally intended, executive privilege was designed

Accept no substitute

I'd like to bring attention to an issue neglected on
campus for far too long » the availability of Traditional
(hex Mix. In the science building as we speak, I have
available to me only Honey-Nut Chex Mix and Cheddar Chex
Mix. I can see the Traditional Chex Mix over the Cheddar:
however. it would be futile to purchase the Cheddar for
the ungodly price of 5.75, foil have only 5.80 to my name,
and could then not afford the Traditional Chex Mix for which
I pine. Night aﬁer night, I pray for someone to purchase
the Cheddar Chex Mix; however. I realize that no one else
would ever want to purchase the Cheddar Chex Mix, as its
very existence is a crime against humanity, so this bag of
Cheddar [hex Mix is destined to block the Traditional Chex
Mix for all of time.

Be a yes man
Ves or no? The eternal question, the ultimate choice.
the most absolute opposite of opposites. Can there be a
more telling choice? No, there can‘t he, and I choose yes.
[ﬁrmly believe that more good than bad would come about
if the answer to all questions were yes. It‘s a word to live
by. Say yes to your friends, yes to the weather. yes to the
salespeople, yes to the starving children in Africa. yes to
the corporate executives, yes I'd like cream with that, yes
I‘d like to supersize my order. Without yes the world would
quickly spiral down into a negation of itself, a world where
each of us would become the owner of a lonely heart,
isolated within our own private little rid-world. So ﬁght
back the darkness and say yes to the night and the day and
shout sweet afﬁrmations into the void. Come, join me in
Yes Land, for I am a Yes Man.
