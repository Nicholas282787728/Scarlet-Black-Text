Greg had been a ﬁghter long before he came ro
college, but he developed his aerivisrn at Grinncll.
A polirical Science major, he loved being involved

ep. 6 and 7

I have three strong
images otcreg, all of which
speak to his disarming demeanor. The
ﬁrst image is of Greg interacting with political
ﬁgures. he introduced Bill aradley on central tampus
in front or hundreds or people and the national press corps in
septemher or 1999. in a role reversal, Greg draped his arm
aroun the candidate. with an air of conﬁdence and
famili ty. ihat comfort extended to his Mean-one
conversations with all sorts of potiticatetites. My husband
returned horn a political event not long ago to report that
when he had left, Greg had cornered congressman Boswell——
talking about the enwronment, no doubt, The second imagei
have is ororeg with his fn‘ends, always appearing to have a

great time. I watched Greg, with Joe Mowers and Emily Mire,
at a holiday party for politicaltypes in Des Moines a couple
of years ago. Having already cornered the Goverrlnr, the three
of them went on to meet new people. ihough not obviously a
crowd that would have much furl, Greg reported later that the
dancing picked up and that no, Joe and Emily closed the
phce down. And ﬁnally, I can picture fireg sitting in my
ofﬁce, slouched down in a chair—looking pretty comfortable.
ostensibly an advisee, Greg had figured most things out on
his own. He was an excellent and serious student, qualities
that may have been obscured by his other accomplishments.
But snmelmw ﬂu! discussions moved from Academics to Greg's
tamily, his friends and his plans.
