Reasons for anal fixation

Living close to other people nukes you rule
in their daily habits. \Vlmt times alarm clocks
go off. who uses whut type oftoorhpnsre and who
doesn’t wash their hands after the hilthmom. It's
something I‘ve noticed more and more, amongst
staff and students uliker People just don't think
to wash their ands after peeing or pooping or
whtltever. They tnught us this in kindergarten!
l elwrys thought people got sitk beenuse of the
stress load at Grinnell, but no. It’s because the
same hand you wiped with is all over the apples
lmd oranges in the dining hall, feeling for just
the right one. Well, someones wrong is someone
clsc's right, and RAM. Poop in the mouth.
There are sinks, there is sonprlliey exist not
because FM enjoys reﬁlling rrntl elenning them,
but beenuse it’s eniled Westenr hygiene, and we
like it.

Abby explains how to survive Thanksgiving back at home

Deilr Abby,

I’m going home for T1mnksgiving,ilndl'm
senred. My fnrnily is crazy! My 95- 'ctlr-old
grandma spouts lliclni epithets. My mother
is going through i midlife crisis and is dat-
ing it ridieal Marxist four ycrlrs older then me.
My aunt is single ind talks exclusively about
\vcightrloss. mining all my love for pie. And
my Hey/cilrrold brother wens too mueh eye-
liner.

I don't know how I'll survive.

Dent Helpless, -

Fri-st ofilll, you ilbsor
lurely must nor witch the
Macy's Day Pimde with
your firmly, All those
ﬂoats will inevitrbly
draw your aum into eompatrsons ofbody size,
send your grandma book to Reeonstruetion,
make your mother's boyfriend rant about con—
sumerism rind, worst of all, make your brother
ery. Trust me. Mrrey’s Dily entitle is not for the
weak. It can test a family beyond its limits—
und that family eould be yours.

For a peueeful Thanksgiving, the key is to
preoeeupy family members wrrh eneh other in~
srerrd.Then you err. relax.

I think that Marxist would have a lovely
trme with your grnritlmu. I ein think of no

one better able to mess wrth elderly lzlcists
than young militant leftists. Go up to the boy-
friend and 510/,“le need to keep in eye on my

Then remind hiln that your mother is likely to

Now that BF and Grandma are paired off,

your mother before dine
net, “I think your son
wants to relate to you.
About i girl sitrrntron.
And i pep telly. And
about how to be young
and hip." Tint ought to
grub her. in the rnennrirue, buy your brother
a Dashboard Confessional CD and some
srenlrhy enrbuds.

If I'm keeping track correctly, that just
leaves your single aunt. Tell her the meal is
“dict."lfthc turkey doesn't put her ro sleep, the
sheer ersrnsy or good food should make her
mnnngenble.

And that leaves you nil nlonc, to eat, drink

STOP I-IATING ON UGG BOOTS. THEY
ARE VERY \NARM AND SOMETIMES
WINTER IS VERY COLD. JUST BECAUSE
THEY HAPPEN TO BE “P‘ASI’IIONABLE'Y
FOR A TIl\IE DOESNT NEGATE THEIR
\N’ONDERFUL FUNCTIONALITY. YOU
SHOULD HANG OUT Vl’lTH ME AND IltlY
UGG BOOTS AND THEN IVVILL THROW
THEM AT YOU AND YOUR FEET WILL
SAY DESI’AIRlNGLY, “NO. V0, DONT
THROW THOSE AT MY STUPID HUr
MAN’S HEAD, PUT THEM ON ME!" AND
THEN YOU WILL FEEL GUILTY FOR BEr
INC 50 MEAN TO YOUR FEET, AND MY
FEET WILL BE WARM AND HAPPY. In this
