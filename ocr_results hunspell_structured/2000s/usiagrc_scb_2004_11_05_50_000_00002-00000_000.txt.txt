championing of faculty pay raises, painted a
picture otFerguson as a complex Woluan.“\'cs,
she was professionrd, digniﬁed and shy," he
said, “but she was also warm, caring and plays
ful.”

Ferguson's husband, Roger, began the night
with an emotional tribute to his late wife He
characterized her as honest, \VIll’)’, strong. and
tenacious, describing how she got tenure over
the objections of a conservative department
chair. He also described her courageous and
long struggle against breast cancer.

Kathy Warfel, Ferguson's sister, talked of
the contrast between herself and her sister.
“Pamela," she said, “was studious, which al-
lowed me to be rebellious,” she said. Warfel
continued to draw distinctions between her
wild youth and Ferguson’s more disciplined
approach to school and life,before concluding
that she was “particularly grateful for [Pam’s]
love of mathematics"

It was that very love of math that earned

JudCo, for you

If a student is accused of violating the rules
or the rights of other students at Grinnell, one
possible way of settling the case is through
Judicial Council, Or JudCo, which consists of six
students and an appointed faculty advisor.

last year, JudCo heard no cases, but this
school year, JudCo has already met twice. JUdCo
is a "fairer process [for students] than adminise
trative decree," Said one student member.

A case can be referred to JUdCo by Security
or the administration. Students are notiﬁed of
their hearing, which is held before a faculty
member and four of the six student members.
Other faculty and administration ﬁgures some-
times sit in an advisory role.

her high recognition, including an appoints
ment by P- sidenr Clinton to the National
Science Board. The chart of that board, Wai-
ren Washington, spoke about Ferguson’s s
vice to that body. Ferguson also wrote proliris
cally for journals, and served as a professor of
mathematics and computer science after rein"
ing as President.

Bucksbaum, a member of the search com
mittee that hired Ferguson, said [hill after the
first interview, they recognized right away that
Ferguson would be their choice.

Bucksbaum also related an anecdote about
Ferguson’s commitment to socialjustice, Dur
ing the capital campaign to ﬁmd the $89 mil.
lion campus renovations and construction, sew
eral prospective donors at a dinner party began
making anti—Semitic remarks. Despite the fact
that the college needed their money and sup
port, Ferguson told them that she could not be
party to the comments. “She was a principled
woman," Bucksbaum said.

r information

The council determines innocence or
guilt on each particular charge, and has
leeway in leveling punishment if guilty. For
less serious orienses, a conduct warning
goes on a student's record. It the offense is
more serious, probation, suspension, expule
sion or lines can be imposed.

Students who wish to he a member or
JudCo can apply at the beginning or the
school year. The identity of student ludto
members are expected to remain conﬁdene
tial, and involved parties are asked not to
discuss details.

Grinnell College environmental coordinator
Dave Theriault '04 discusses his job, compost-

ing and conservation

This semester’s environmental coordinator,
Dave Therianlt ‘04, is focusing on composting
and recycling, The sew caught up with him
last Friday, Oct. 29, after he returned from a
conference on composting waste.

Q: Wlmt are rbc mm [resting “771!!! hi you
In"): about Grinnell’x t7111i!071771l71fi’df7‘lu‘21tﬂ?

A: The two most pressing concerns the ad-
ministration has assigned me to are compose
ing and recycling. 1 just attended a conference
on composting this morning, and eventually
Grinnell will have the central campus dining
hall compost all food waste. The composting
will occur orrcampus in conjunction with the
town, and the resulting compost will be used
on campusThis prevents nutrients from being
wasted and conserves water and energy. *

Q: Dayan wine 1);: derirc [o [u more environ-
menm/Iy/ricnd/y mom [I am we ”qu2 ['04) Dr
from 1/12 amino/ration?

A: Everyone has a different role, The star
dents need to press their concerns but then
they also have to make use of what the ad-
ministration grves them, for example, use the
recycling rooms more rrcquenrly. The admin.
istration has to be environmentally friendly
on the institutional level by supporting green
building and providing financial capital.

at (I had a/wnte/J deg?

A: I think it takes a socially conscious stus
dent body to make the administration con-
scious. I think it's one of those things where
they play off of each other. Without the stuc
dent body being interested in it rhe adminis
tration has little reason to be interested.

Q: When 11an why am yuurpuritian [rut/ed?

A: A campus committee has been looking
into a permanent environmental coordinator
Brian Turner [‘01] did a one year intern-
ship in this capacity by walking into Russell
l<. Osgood’s ofﬁce and pitching an idea for
the position. President Osgood said, “This is
pretty good. You won't get paid much but we’ll
see how it goes.” It was successful; he started
the student garden over on Park St. and he got
some other things going.
