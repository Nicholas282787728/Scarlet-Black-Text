Baseball: an irrational love

In my last column, I believe I said
something about getting married
“when hell freezes over." I’m going to
have to amend that statement, because
as anyone who saw the SOC-point font
headline on the New York Daily News
last Thursday knows, hell did freeze
over. The Boston Red Sox beat the
Yankees for the pennant.

I'm not getting married. But I am
going to do something completely uri-
characteristic of myself; I'm going to
write an entire column about sports.
You see, as indifferent to sports as I may
appear to the casual observer, I’m actu—
ally quite capable of getting extremely
worked up about baseball.

As I write this on Monday after»
noon, I'm hesitant to make any predicr
tions about what the next tour days will
bring, and I don’t want to guess and
jinx things. But, oh, Red Sox, please,
please, pIem win.

I’m from New York, yes. But with
a mother from Massachusetts and a
rather from Brooklyn, 1 am genetically
incapable ofcxpcr'lencing anything but
joy to see the Yankees embarrassed. In

fact, I do believe that the Evil Empire
may be my least favorite thing about
the city] love so much.They deﬁnitely
rank right up there with cockroaches
and that [expletive deleted] who robbed
me or my wallet on the 9 train. Roorr
ing for the Yankees is like reading the
Harry Potter books and cheering on the
Death Eaters.

For all you non-baseball people out
there, I know I sound crazy. Baseball
is a crazy irrational thing. All of the

‘ sports announcers on TV can tell you

the probability ofa comeback arter lose
ing the first three games of a series, or
a player's batting average in post-season
play. They can even tell you thatJohnny
Damon’s hair is 297% longer than that
of the average Yankee player, and that
27% percent ofall fans like mustard on
their pretzels. Hell, those statistics peoe
ple can tell you almost anything, except
what’s actually going to happen. They
couldn’t explain how the Red Sox won
last Wednesday, for example. And they
can't explain why baseball makes other
wise digniﬁed people cover themselves
with body paint and scream obscenities

at each other.

Baseball even made Kevin Costner
listen to creepy voices and mow down
his cornfield. More recently, baseball
made my mother (and later me)
open the living room window
and yell ”Go Red Sox" out into
a street full of sulking and pos-
sibly violent Yankees tans.

Baseball also has the power
to make terribly pragmatic
people suddenly superstitious.
Iryou've ever watched a game
with a truly obsessed fan,you
know that everyljt‘tle action
matters; and I’m not
just talking about the
players. If your feet are
on the coffee tablewhcn
your team gets on base, youd damn well
better not take your feet off the coffee
table. If you go to get a glass of water
and come back to find that DerekJeter
hit a home run, then you’d better not
drink any more water tor the remainder
ofthe series. I thought this sort oflogic
was peculiar to my own family until I
watched Sunday’s game with Joe Geni.

“Hey,"loc exclaimed when I returned

from the bathroom to find that Boston

had scored, “you should leave and come
back more,”

Perhaps you are one or those

people who ﬁnd baseball to be

boring. You may feel that five

hours in front ofa television set

would be better spent watehe

ing the BBC version of Pride

mid Prejudice than the World

Series. But try thinking of

baseball as 3 Jane Austen

novel in cleats. Both

may seem tedious to the

disinterested

bystander.

However, to

someone truly

invested, its impossible to not be on

the edge of your seat the entire time. Is

Captain Wentworth really in love with

Anne Elliot? Will Johnny Damon hit

a home run? Is Mr. Darcy going to go

ahead and propose already, or will this

novel go into extra innings? Stay tuned
to find out.

If ‘all the world’s a stage...’

Things are going quite well herein London as the
inevitable rain sets in, As you read this, we Grinnclr
lians will be wrapping up our fall break using Lon
don as the gateway to a myiiatl of European escapes
» Prague, Rome, Amsterdam, Paiis.... I myself will
have been in Dublin to research lny ancestors because
I’m a geek like that,

But before I head to the homc of Keats, Wile
dc, Joyce and countless other theatre heroes '
1 must tell you how incredibly rife London
is with theatres, [Disclaimen I’m a theatre
major, this may be a bit biased]

It i disputnble, but there have been
many a Londoner I've met so tar that
has said that London is the world’s
capital of the theatre (disputablc be
cause I don‘t want a New Yorkei to
bite my head offfol something I didn’t
say).

It is true that the London theatre ,
scene is massive, including small com
munity theatres that barely seat one
hundred audience members (such as the one I will
interning at next month) to larger than life West End
theatres (think Broadway) where musicals like 77;:
Lion King and Ler Mir have been running for hull-
dreds of days.

The Grinncu program has given us the opportur
niry to See a variety or shows in a variety of venues.
We just recently saw a revival of a 1930s war drama
in a West End theatre and we’ve seen thrcc shows in
the great monolithically concrete National Theatre.
Great fun,greut fun.

London's theatre prestige goes way back as we
know. Shakespeare once lived and penned some nrlris
great works in London, working at the Globe The
atie. And London has not foigotten him, Parliament
dutifully passed an Act at Parliament (clover name,
what?) to allow the reconstructed Globe to have an

authentic thatch roof installed (thatch = dry gr.
fire hazard : against the law after the Great
Bro ot'1666 levelled most of London), And

tlons ofa Shakespeare play available tor the

avid Elizabethan drama gcck.

England shares with its once—colony.
But the tiue jewel in out Shakespeare-

door to thc house that Shakespeare lived in when
he came back from London but was torn down be
cause the guy who boughtit later got sick ot'everyone
knocking on hrs door wanrrng to see where the Bard
had lived. And of course, The Birth House, where of
course dear William was born,

All very exciting, especially ifycu take delight, as'l
did, at the sight orlapanese tourists taking pictures ot‘
each other in front of the house. (Don't ask me why,
it was just amusing).

The other total upside to uni visit to Stratford
with the Gl‘lnlicll»lii-Lolidoii posse was that we had
at our fingertips the wise Donna Vintci' (Shakespeare
Professor and London Program Director) to tell us
that ifwe hurried over to the Black Swan Pub (known
locally as the Dirty Duck) we might be able to see the
uctois out of costume and make up.

And given that the R805 actors don’t look half
bad in tigl\rs,wcll, you know we were there. One brave
soul, Miss Lcah Romanclli ('06) and friends tried to
buy Hamlet, aka Toby Stephens, a pint. Though he
said he didn't drink, he did accept a Diet Pepsi, much
to their delight. Sorry to say, Mr. Stephens, recently
seen 'in the recent Bondeﬂick “Die Another Day" as
the bad guy Gustav Graves (thankyou IMDB.com) is
married, but he gave a great question and answer ses-
sion a day later when be extrapolated on the meanings
of Hamlet and how he liked being a Bond villain.

So what thrs long tangential column boils down
to is: if as Shakespeare said, ‘All the world’s a stage
then all the world is in London, a far cry from the
middle oflowa.
