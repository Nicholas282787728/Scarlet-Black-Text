Immigration. globalization, and ladical-
ismiin today's herrildenngly diverse and
qunri'eling world, ritly answers are few and far
henveen. In David Edgar‘s Tet/rag we Et/m,
he explores themes of belonging, c ship
and identity rrom ruultiplc pcrspecuvcs and
viewpoints. Directed by Lesley Delmenico,
Theatre, this production has performances at
8 pm. on Thursday, Fliday, and Saturday, with
a matinee at 2 p.m. on Sunday,

The U5, premiere of the British play is a
rastepaccd and rlrongltteprovoking production
following the travails ora diverse group orinr
migrants from Pakistan, Egypt, Somalia, and
other countries who hope to become British
citizens by taking a required ESOL (English
Speakers of Other Lnnguages) citizenship
class, As we watch these characters snuggle
through various cultural clashes and misutr
dcrstandings, we are forced to consider some
big questionsi whom is a citizenship test
meant to keep out? Is a shared identity pose
sible in a society with so many different vicvw
points.> ls radical Islam compatible with tree
democracy?

“[This play] is about the journey that each
of these characters takes,” Delnienico said.
“Everybody rakes a journey and ﬁnds them-
selves someplace,”

The play employs 18 actors in order to por—
tray a staggering 41 characters, dirrerentiating
each from the other using lighting, costume,
dialects, and physicaliry. It presents a very wide
spectrum of chamcters, each with separate
motivations and needs. Examples include a
Ukrainian woman (Jordan Adams ’10) trying
to free herself from a marriage to a Pakistani
man, a Muslim boy in drug withdrawal (sal-
man Chowdhury ’10). and an Egyptian wom»
an striving to practice her religion in peace
(Sumana Shankar’lo).

Timing (be Er)"; moves forward at a hlisV
tering pace, emphasized by dramatic and often
chaotic lighting that deﬁnes the setting. Each
strand ornarrative is presented in choppy frag-
ments. sometimes cutting cllamcters off mid-
thought. And although these stories begin
separately, each grows more interconnected

with the others as the story progresses.

Because the play involves such controver»
sial subject matter, one of Delinenico‘s main
concerns was to portray characters in a cultur-
ally accurate manner; With the help of Arabic
teacher Mcrvat Youssef, Delmenico made sure
the actors' mannerisms and accents were as
true to life as possible. “The theatre depart
ment gave most of us dialect CD5." said Leda
Hoffmann ’09, who plays the British ESOL

teacher. “I just did a standard British ncccn|~

which was difficult because it’s hard to tie the
accent into rhe lines as you learn [them]."

Actors had these responsibilities in addis
tion to delivering realistic performances. “[It]
vlms particularly difﬁcult because I wasn't {as
miliar at all with the dialects I had to do for
the show.” said Kevin Trudel '12, who appears
as two different characters. “It wasn’t [that] I
didn't know how to do a Korean oi Iranian
accent. It was that I don't even know what a
Korean or Iranian accent [was]."

The issues oridenrity raised in this produce
tion are applicable to concerns on the Grinnell
campus as well as to the rest ofthc world. Ul-
timately, Testing the Echo makes us reﬂect
upon the plurality of identities with which we
share our world, while also reminding us ofour
inherent interconnectedness.

"I particularly like doing plays that reﬂect
contemporary urban society in its diversity and
complexity,"Delinenico said.
