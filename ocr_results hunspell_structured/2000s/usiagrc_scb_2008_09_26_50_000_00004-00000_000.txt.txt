The Afghanistan Human Development Report 2007 de-
ﬁnes the rule oflaw in an Afghan context as “all those state
and non-state institutions that promote justice and human
development through the application of public rules that are
deemed fair, applied independently, enforced equally, and
consistent with human rights principles" Do you think such
a system works? Or will changes have to be made?

Afghanistan has never had a cenrmlIzedjustIce system that
was the main thing that people went to for dispute resolution.
Most Afghans have always gone to village level counselsﬂln
ders’ counsels, religious leadersito resolve their disputes and

At the some tune, you have
bigger issues, particularly these
days In Afghanistan, of terror
ism, drug trafﬁcking, larger-
scale land disputes, abuses by

warlordsithe types of things that can’t be handled in a com
munity setting. And so you really need a system that can handle
both ends of that spectrum, that can both continue to solve
the problems otordiuary Afghans but at the same time can do
something bigger and something that’s actually based not on
custom or on goodjudgment or fairness,

have continued to commit abuses since 2001. Some of these

This has fundamentally undermined, I think, some of
the hope that Afghan people had

have to make.” Its Ieally son of a cover for the fact that they
dont want to deal with the problem.

create a hybrid system like that you need
to combine both the participatlon othe
central government and of the people In
the community.

In “Path to Peace,]ustiee in Afghanistan," an article you
authored forThe Christian Science Monitor, you wrote, “In
Afghanistan, lack of accountability continues to erode sup-
port for the government and creates fertile ground for insure
gency,” Could you speak about the current state of account—
ability in Afghanistan?

and Older.

Is there an alternative to the role that the Us currently
plays In Afghanistan?

I don’t think that there’s an alteInat‘Ive in the sense that the
overall dimensions of what we're trying to do, supporting an
Afghan government that is elected by its people, that follows
basic human rights norms, and most importantly now, that can
defend and protect Afghan teIrItory. Those fundamentals are
not the things that need to change. What needs to clIInge Is
the implementation ofthosc fundamentals.

There’s been an enormous amount of rhetoric about what
Afghanistan would become, but in reality we haven’t done much
to implement it. Human rights is a great example ofthat, Of
course, the United States says it supports human rights, but in

were not. And, the thing that’s important

to remember is that Afghanistan has just
been through hell over the last thirty years,

The more complicated question becomes about the Taliban
because the Taliban were terrible in most respects. They were
terrible on women's rights, destroyed culnlral artifacts, allowed
Al-Qaeda to operate freely, But at the same time, they were
very strict on law and order. People always say that during the
Taliban period you could walk down the road from Kabul to
Kandahar with a sack ofmoncy on your back and no one would
ever touch you. And today, again largely because of the Taliban,
you couldn't drive there in an armored car without getting shot
at,

I find the comparison kind ofcompllcated. Ultimate-
ly, this is a better path and the involvement of the international
community, which didn't exist virtually at all in the 1990s, Is
a much better thing, But whether it has actually made people
better offseven years in is certainly debatable for some.
