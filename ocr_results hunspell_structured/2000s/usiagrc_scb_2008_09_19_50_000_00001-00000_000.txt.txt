in SGA elections low

The votes have been counted and the results are anticli’
mactic,

This semester's SGA Joint Board elections saw extremely
low turnout from both candidates and voters. On a campus (6*
puted for its political energy, this week's election showcased a
student body seemingly uninterested in its own .impus-wide
issues,

22 students ran for ii totiil ofls Senator positions,ivhich are
distributed amongst the college's seven cluster-s. According to
numbers supplied by SGA, in every cluster, with the exception
of Looseheiid, fewer than 50 students voted for Senators.

Students cited quite simple reasons for not voting in the
election. “I never knew about it,"s.iid Aniar Sarltar’lZ.

Joseph Jane '12 was apathetic towards the elections as well
as uninformed. “I didn't care. I dldl‘fi even know where the
voting booth was," he said. “People didn't exactly prrt out who,
what, where, when, why and how to vote for them."

According to SGA Administrative Coordinator Josef Sch-
neider '09, first-semester elections typically see a low turnout
for both candidates and voters. “Most people are still getting
situated, and [the elections] are spnrrrg rrght on them,” he said.
“Some people, like ﬁrst»yeats, mrght not even know what cxv
actly is going on yet."

But even within this trend, this year's election tutnorrt was
particularly low. Schneider attributed this further drop-off in
participation to laclduster campaigns. “[Votet turnout] corrld
have been better," he said. "It is the responsibility ofthe candi—

Pub management
brings new Ideas,
new amusements

BY VICKY DIEDRICHS

After a troubled opening last semester, Lylc's Pub is back
with ti vengeance.

With new decor, foodstuffs, and entertainment options, the
pubs management plans to draw a wider clientele and meet fiscal
and legal requirements to keep Lyle's open to everyone.

The managers of the pub said they hope that this year will
show a marked improvement over last year, Susan l<lumpner '09,
coemanager of Lyle’s, said that “last year, the decorations were
sparse and the entertainment was slim." And, more importantly,
revenue was small.

The pub staffsald they are looldng to create a place where
Grinnellrans cart have a good time but also a place where students
will want to spend their money.“\Ne lost about $16,000 last se-
niester,"said cormanager Drake Ealleiv‘ORS."[Roughly] 55.000
to $6,000 of that was oneetirne startetrp costs btrt regardless,
that’s 3100007311300 [lost] in not even a full semester."

According to Hallow, last year's deficit could be reflected as
a potential loss of 525,000 a year, “[Tlie administration] told us
that if that happens they're going to shut us down, so we need to
break even or make a profit this semester, otherwise, the pub may
be no more,” he said.

The ﬁscal strain from last year has already led Lyle’s to cut
back on open hours. The pub will be open 30 fewer hours per
week this semester, translating to rlt least $400 in savings each
week.

In addition to a mounting debt, Lylc’s also faced legal press
sures last semester. Ofﬁcially classified as a “pub" by town law,
Lyle's can only admit patrons who are at least 18 years old. But
in order to maintain the “pub" designation and avoid becomrng
a “bar" that can only admit customers over 21, Lyle's must make
at least 50 percent ofits revenues from sales of food and other
non-alcoholic items. As orearly May last scmcstcr,only a third of
the pubs revenues were roIn sales ofthese items.

in order to increase food sales and reduce the proportion of
