crime, though Grinnell Police Captain Theresa Peterson said the
crane was only legally listed as a property crime.

But DirectOl of Security Steve Briscoe, who sent an allrcamr
pus C’lnﬂll calling the incident “biasnnotivated,” said it could be
termed a hate crimc. “What made this a hate crime wore the
homophobic remarks,”hc said,“and it looked like it was directed
toward a particular individual."

Security contacted the police immediately after taking a re-
port on the event. The two departments are working together to
ﬁnd leads or clues, but as of yet, have found little.

“Right now we’re telling people that you can give info anonyt
mously,” said Briscoe. “I just want the info."

Rumors circulated campus that a derogatory banner and a
cartoon ofa dinosaur on a chway (a “scgway-a-sanras") might
lead to clues. But this trail came to a dead end when Ian hinder-
skov'os came forward, explaining that both the sign and dmwing
had been part ofa paity on the ﬂoor thrown by the Women’s
Frisbee team. Lundcl'skov alelted RLC Kim HlndS’BnISh, and
sent an apology C’mml to the entire ﬂoor in Haincs.

But with few icmaining clues, Pctcrson said she is not optit
mistic about iinding those responsible “unless someone comes
forward." If nothing comes out within another week, Peterson
said, it's likely that the full-scale investigation will stop.

Student ﬁnds support

The incident came with much or the college’s queer com-
munity away at a conference. “Had they been on campus, 1
could have called any one of them,"Anne said.“But they weren't
there.”

For this reason, Anne waited to call Security until the next
morning. Before making the call, she spoke to her girlfriend and
then called a friend who was an SA on North Campus to help
her deal with the questioning.

“I was scared because I’m not really out to people," said
Anne.

That night, she had found the hall’s quote board torn in half;
the part with a quotation from her girlfriend had been thrown
away. As she got it out of the trash, she saw a new message:
“Bitch stop it."

With the arrival of many queer students back on campus
Sunday, Anne said the atmosphere immediately changed. "I’m so
happy with cveryone’s response to it,”said Anne, “i feel like l'm
more than taken care of in thc queer community especially"

Since then, she has worked with administrators and queer
activists on campus to figure out responses.

But the incident is hard for Anne to move past.

“It’s really hard for me to be put in the spotlightiword
spreads fust,"Anne said. “A lot of people know that it was me."

Before the incident, Anne was still deciding how “out" she
wanted to be, and how safe itwas to be a queer person on cam

us.
p “It's been a build up of [mist for] me being able to just hold
hands with [my girlfriend]," she said. “This just kind of shatters
that build-up of trust." '

Rally The forum opened with President K. Rus—
from p. 1 sell K. Osgood thanking and praising organizv
ers and participairts.“l’ve never seen so much energy in my whole
life at 8:10 at night,"he said. “You’re a sign thatgood things can
come out ofbad things."

Speakers said that the incident was an affront notjust to the
queer community, but to the college at-large. "A lot of people
have been saying that this is a just a quest issue," said Lauro
Franco '08. “Well you know what? Fuck that! This was an attack
on our community."

Representatives ofGrinnell College’s Executive Council and
the Grinnell Human Rights Commission read statements of
support. Erin Mellurnty ’09 spoke on the importance ofactively
combating discrimination as organizers distributed ﬂiers with
tips and resources on being an ally.

lamicAlpcr'09,a memberonicctPcoplc ofColor (QPOC)
and Qiccr Rainbow Super Team (QRST) said that it was im-
portant for people to carefully assess their impact on the Grinnell
community "1 want to urge you to look at this as a greater in-
stitutional problcm,"Alpcr said. “And when I say institutional I
am not talking about the administration or the faculty, but what
affects us every day in the lesidence halls, what we're complicit
with in the classroom and among our friends,”she said.

Interim Vice President ofStudent Affairs Elena Bernal said
that the incident was “a reminder that we are not inextricable
from the world we live in.”

Some participants said that Grinnell's image as a comma
nity ofacceptunce was not always true, but that the week's events
would help to strengthen solidarity among those segments that
are accepting. "I don’t feel that all Grinnellians are supportive,"
said Graciela Guzman '11. “But I feel that this is one of the best
ways fot the Grinnciiians that are supportive to come out in
numbers and rally with each other to show their strength."

While participants thought it was important to hold discus
sions on issues of acceptance, others, such as John Burrows '10
felt the spectacle ofThursday’s events would be especially ettcc-
tivc. “I think that having such a visible event as this, and not just
having discussions about it is really going to show that we
don't accept this kind ofbehavior on campus,” Burrows said.

Burrows and others also emphasized the need to keep the is
sue of acceptance prominent in the community berweenjust the
events of these weeks.

Event organizers said they intend to maintain a longttcrm
discussion about discrimination. "We deﬁnitely have no drive to
let this conversation fall off the table," said Erin Duran '09.

Duran said that she and others want to bring the dialogue to
individuals who might not otherwise be involved in discussions
of discrimination. “We've been working with administrators to
do something within the residence halls," she said.

Earlier in the week StoneCo and (80C sponsored and
SRC open house to familiarize students with the center's re-
sources and help prepare for Thursday’s events. Students were
busy putting up posters across the campus and tabllng outside of
the dining hall to get student signatures of support.

Response went beyond mass events as Brian Perbix '09,Julie
Ross '09 and Jamie Alper '09 drafted a resolution condemning
the crime and reiterating the call for tolerance throughout the
college. The resolution also called for the creation of an ad hoc
committee to on creating safe spaces on and off campus.

The importance of the resolution even caused Joint Board
to temporarily suspend a constitutional requirement that Joint
Board vote on resolutions at least a week after their introduction.
“I stood up and said it would be more effective if we decided to
take a vote and pass it now,” said Jamaland Senator Harsha Sekar
'09. “This is well beyond what SGA normally votes on and it’s
the most important thing that’s come to SGA this semester."

This coming sunday various student groups will be spont
suing a workshop on how to create a safe space and Tuesday
will feature another open forum, this one looking at how the
weekend’s incident impacts sclttgovcrnance.

As the campus recovers from the acts orhatc community
membets have emphasized the need not to look back in anger
but to look forward in the hope that this might spur the campus
to valuable introspection and needed change. “Grinnell needs to
be especially vigilant now," said Duran. “But I think a lot can rec
ally happen positively from this.”
