Matherly said that on two rounds, search dogs converged

body for that being missed," said Matherly.

Last spring, for his tiitorial‘s music hap—
pening,” Paul Shuman-Mootc '09 performed
in the style of Jandek, an idiosyncratic bluese

_ folk musician who was one of Paul's favorite
performers. Paul played a guitar and sang cov-
ers‘ofjandels tunes and nursery rhymes, never
once breaking character.

Eric McIntyre, Music, Paul’s advisor and
professor of lost year's “Weird Music" tuto-
rial, said that even being confronted with the
weirdest of weird performances couldn't shake
Paul.

“I had a chicken in one hand and was yell-
ing Dr. Phil excerpts at pcoplc...I went up to
Paul and was reading these Dr. hi1 excerpts,
uying to maintain character furiously. I‘ve got
’the camera on him, and ijust started laugh»
ing, because he would not be shaken, he didn’t
shake at all, and it was just this true perfon
man'cc,” McIntyre said. “There was Paul over

there just eomplctely' in character, in the style
ofJandek singing Itsy Bitsy Spidei’.

Music played a signiﬁcant role in Peul‘s
life. “ V

“For him, music was just pure passion,"
McIntyre said "Its hard to describe, its just

other students, would play'a show at least
once a month.

"What we played varied e.lectronics,
toy instruments, non music objects," he said,
“It sounds kind of ridiculous, toy instniments,
but it was a serious pursuit'ifor him]."

Emily Iwuc '08 was
on the Concerts Com-
mittee with Paul, and oft

She said that Paul
taught her different as-

music, like how to circuit bend and solder.
