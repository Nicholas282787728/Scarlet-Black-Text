facelift as new music space

After a troublesome past few years, a non— Norris
band practice space is established In hopes to
make a more musician— friendly campus

BYJAMES ANTHOFER
Since the demise of Musik Hairs, campus
has been relatively quiet as hands search for
the perfect practice place. But this year, there
should be more opportunities for students to
rock out than ever before.
The old Grab-and- Go space next to

years underscores the importance of getting a
space working. “The last Frecsound CD was
very full,witli a lot otsongs on there, but there
were a lot of solo artists, said Lindgr-cn. lts

an area more

their craft.The
student group
Freesound (as
opposed to the compilation CD), along wrth
SGA and administrators, played a central role
in establishing the new space.

“A lot of different spaces have been used
over the past few years,” said Josh Lindgren
‘08, SGA Concerts chair and Freesound media
head. “There are a lot of issues with the Not-
rtS space right now, because that's existed for
a while."

Thc Norris basement has faced concerns
with ﬂooding. noise complaints from residents
and has posed problems for bands because of
its limited access, with only one key available
for the door to the space,

The new practice space shouldn’t have any
of these problems, given its location tinder-
ncath usually unused Qrad and the distribu-
tion or tour keys to members or Freesound.
South Campus, winch presumably houses
more musicians, also adds to the appeal orthe

has released compilations of campus
bands every year since then. It plans
to take advantage of the new practice
space almost as soon as the instru—
ments are moved in.

The new area will be brgger than
the current one, enough that most
bands should be able to set up drums
and a couple of amplifiers and still
have half of the room to use. As a part
of the move, Freesound has repaired
one of its largest ampliﬁers and its drum set,
both ofwhicli will be available for any strident
to use. Other instruments include a gritar, bass
and keyboard.

Tire use will be contingent on new train»
ing to prevent the problems that Freesound
has historreally had in keeping free instru-
ments for students. “There's a PA system. that
we would use for vocals, that peoplc used to
have dance parties (by sending songs through
it)," said Lindgrcn. “That's a really good way
to blow out your PA system, so that’s not go
ing to happen anymore . .but some of the
equipment needs repairing because its as old
as Frecsound itself.’

A campus bands showcase is planned for
Nov. 30 to debut the new space. Eric Rohn ’08,
the head of Fieesound and a musician himself,
is excited for the potential for the area, which
lends itself to music performance given its
proximity to Gardner lounge. “it's just more
convenient for shows," he said.

Hidden from the traffic of campus, the
summer work ofThomas Agran ’09 is on dis-
play in a dark, quiet space.

Agran is curator for the “Subject Space:
Interiors from the Grinnell College Art Col-
lection" exhibit currently showing through
Dec. 16 rn the Print study Room on the lower
level ofBurhng Library

“Subject Space” grew out of Agran's in»
ternship with Fairleoner Gallery this summer
under Lesley wright, director or the gallery.
“I spent about 20 hours a week .. , researching
for my exhibit, organizing the collection and
planning for tunrre exliibits,"lic said.

The overriding theme ofthe exhibit is a {or
cus on interior spaces, butwithrn that theme is
great variance in the prints, A forlorn panther
snrck inside a dreary cage, made even more
stark by the charcoal drawing, is shown in
William Kciitridge's emotionecharged “Pans
ther in Cage with Bowl.”A few prints down is
a unique 3D paper and sketch model encased
in a normal ﬂat frame ofa project by Christo
entitled “Corridor Storefront Project.”

A variety of media (including etchings
and photography), moods and settings can be
found rn the small yet diverse show. Simple in»
stallations and captions help to keep the focus
on the character, intimacy and emotion inher-
ent in the interior spaces depicted.

All or the work for “Subject Space" was
drawn from the Grinnell print collection.
wright said that the college’s collection serves
as a sort ofvisual library. “Print collections are

“This is a visually saturated world,"

Agran began putting “Subject space“ tar
gether by surveying the collection. “I looked
through the college’s collection for good prints,
prints I liked,"Agran said, adding that he soon
noticed that many of these prints had an em-
phasis on interiors,

The next step for Agran was installing the
art with the help of Milton Severe, Faulconer
Gallery's director of exhibition design. After
framing the art and writing comments, he and
Severe installed prints and adjusted the light—
ing in an afternoon,

Grinnell’s print collection is available to
anyone who wishes to peruse the stacks, and
Agran hopes to expose more people to the
College’s collection ofnrt, “Most people don't
take the time to see prints," he said, adding
that he hasn’t heard much reaction [0 the ex-
hibityet.

Agran is no stranger to art. He had a show
in the smith Gallery last year and has one
planned for next week, and is the art editor for
the Grinnell Review.

Agran was pleased with his experience and,
as a studio Art major, hopes to draw on the
skills he learned in the future. “There’s not
much potential for money, but there is potens
rial tor happiness," he said. “I’ve gained a lot of
respect for print managers and what they do."

The Print Study Room is open from 1r10
p.m, weekdays. A reception for Agran and the
exhibit will be held on Nov, 27 at 4:15 pm. in
the Print Snidy Room.

Feeling himself grow angry, James

"I don't serve murderers in my bat.”

suddenly Beth appeared at Clyde’s elbow.
She was breathing heavily and James norieed
that she had dark circles under eyes and a
puﬁ‘incss to her cheeks that comes with lack
ofslceping.

“Its not like Lhat,‘ she said. She had the
messenger bag hanging at her side. There was
a suspiciously skull-shaped lump at the top of
the bag. James shuddcred He had never had
a suong stomach; blood, bodies and anything
involving either of those categories always
struck him the wrong way and this was no ex-
ception. Beth leaned across the oourrter and
grabbed the scrap of James apron and pulled
him towards her.

“We didnt kill him really."

“We just found him.” She said still close
to his eat.

“Where?"

“Clyde's trout yard, buried under that big
apple tree."
