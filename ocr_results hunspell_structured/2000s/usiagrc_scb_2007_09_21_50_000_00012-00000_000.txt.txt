Making light of drunk driving

All signs point toward a banner year for off»cnm~
pus parties. Thanks to an unusunlly large first-year
class, more than 200 students abandoned the dorms
for the luxurious offrcanlpus lifestyle. But as more
students venture off-campus,
vehicle usage may be inc
lngiand with that, an rnr list
in drunk driving.

During Essential Student
week alone. two students were
at nod for driving under the
influence. And as the year plan
grosses, the weather wrll lnevr
nrbly worsen We can only expect car use on wetlnes
do and wcckends to continue as fall sets in. Indeed,
cold spells and rainstorms during the last two rvcclcs
had students sciiiiyiiig to thcii cais in order to gct
to the Pub. Designated drivers were only present for
some cars.

Silence speaks volumes about extreme religion

Before diving into Darwinism, my
class took a poll about our personal
beliefs of creationism or evolution, 15
divine intervention possible> As every-
one furtively, silently scribbled their an»
swers,I sat clueless. I didn't know what
to write. We revealed our answers, and
it was suddenly clear that my classmates
found it
a b s n i d ,
practically
impossible,
thatanyone
at Grinnell
would give
the reli—
gious point of view even the smallest
amount ofvalidiry.

The poll spur-red fierce responses
from my class. I wasn't surprised~rhis

be an unfriendly and uncompromiy
ing attitude toward religion on our
campus.Thc godless and the Gods
fearing are very vocal on eampus.Thelr
yelling makes my quiet, middletoftthet
road Christian stance feel uncomfort—
able.

Coming from Charlotte, N.C.,
smack in the middle of the Bible Belt,
I hoped to escape the "my way or the
highway” mindset by coming to college
in the middle of Iowa's cornﬁelds. Un-
fortunately, thc extremes of our campus
religious spectrum between a very ace
tive, fundamentalist God and no God
at all have filled this void.

and loudest Christian group. I joined
GCCF after arriving on campus. As a
member of nn intercollegiate network
called Intel-varsity, GCCF's purpose

However. Intervarsity abides by except

Just down IVSO, at Central College

in which the student government Mn

Grinnell, students—myself included—v
have been discouraged from leadership

portantly, who they are.

If GCCF wants to be the cam»
pus home for Christians, 1 think they
should allow for, encourage and respect
as equal all readings orthe Bible'ro do
this may require GCCF to reevaluate
their Intervatsity afﬁliation with us den
manding strict policies.

But Intervarsity and GCCF don't
hold a monopoly on such intolerance
at Grinnell. I ioutinely stumble upon
people who are appalled that anyone
at Gtinnell still has ieligioiis faith. My
classmates reacted similarly to Cu] in
class poll. in addition, assumptions that
all religions are bad as well as the corn-
mon rnisper-ccptron thnt all Christians
are fundamentalist oversimplify the
grind spectrum of beliefs. Those of us
quietly in the middle
are excluded.

The antitrelit
gious play an equally
vocal and critical role
in Grrnnell's religious
drama. For many,
Grinnell may be
the first place where
their open doubt nnd
di<beliefis not shunned. Here, their be-
liefs~or lack there of~dommate the
mainstream. In spite of this newfouud
freedom. some Grinnellians seem to be
so excited by tolerance for their conviCt
tions that they ignore all others. We
undermine what could an openeminde
ed atmosphere with a narrow one.

When we integrate a diversity of
religious viewpoints. we strengthen

Inclusive student groups are worth
celebrating, but so are individuals,
Many individuals display these same
traits as they quietly stroll to chuich
on Sunday mornings. The Chaplains
ofﬁce continually supports people like
these through programs nnd clrrbs that
celebrate as well as question a diversity
of faiths and religious traditions. It's
just hard sometimes to hear the thSr

intolerant yelling of

No solution I
could propose would
be a quick fur, and I
don’t have a toldo
list to achieve reli-
gious inclusion or open-mindedness
on campus. But a bit more acceptance
and awareness—inspired by groups like
Chalut—Lim—would have made me feel
much more comfortable with my al-
ready insecure bcliefs during that poll
about divine intervention. Less yelling,
and more listening, would relieve the
pressure upon those of us torn in the
middle.
