Beyond Borders ( )

What’s the difference between a
bleeding heart and noblesse oblige? In
Beyond Borders, as much as they would
like us to think otherwise, not all that
much.

The film opens on a fundraising
dinner at which Sarah Jordan (AngEr
Iina Jolie) is dancing, oblivious to the
bleak world outside wealthy London.
Suddenly, Nick Callahan (Clive Ow»
ens) bursts in wnh a young African
refugee and tells all the stuffy upper
crust philanthropists that their Cxpenr
sive champagne and pretty diess parties
aren‘t helping Suffering people across
the globe any, even though they like
to think so Sarah, profoundly moved
by his outburst, decides to bieak free
or high society and help him with his
medical operations in Ethiopia. Upon
arriving, she is again profoundly moved
by the plight ofthe staiving, sickly poor
pics ofthis desert wasteland. She wan-
ders around with her big pouty lips and
srrikinglywhite, clcaii clothing: the cleft

out the film, Sarah doesn’t seem to do
much more than ride around iii trucks
and touch children.

Somewhere in all of this, she and
Nick fall in love. Although they maiiv

age to help people in Cambodia and get
into some big trouble in Chechnya, the
work that they ate supposedly so pas-
sionate about takes backseat to their
wild romance. We see some skinny
Africans, some Khmer Rouge thugs
and Communists in ski masks, but they
aren’t named; their dialogue isn’t tranSr
lated; their interactions with the relief
workers are unfailingly either complete-
ly submissive or completely aggressive.

The thing about Beyond Borders
is if you don’t think about it, it‘s not
all that had. A sort of idealized misery
abounds iii the ﬁllu.Tlic foicign locales
look nicvicq‘eady. They don’t route;
the grit and suf ring and sickness that
come with life in refugee camps. Inc

Maybe the film is food for thought.
oi discussion. It isn’t perfect, but in that

way, it would like to think that it is.

Harry Potter and the

Prisoner of Azkaban (PG)

Harry, Hermione, Hagrid and the
rest of the gibberishly Britishly named
wizards and Muggles are back in the
third installment of J.K Rowling’s
excessively popular, excessively long,
children’s books

But this time, things are dlﬂerﬁnfi
Harry and friends are another year
older and another year awkwarder.
This is evident from the opening
scene, when Harry's secretive, subs
bedsheets spellcasting alludes to arr
other favorite laternight activity of
teenage boys. With the cast’s changing
bodies, the film's tone has matured and
darkened, but also become fresher and
less cluttered.

Complicating Harry (Daniel Radt

in all matters demented and serious is
new Hogwarts professor Remus Lupin

the prodigious plot is the pre-teen love
triangle between oafish Ron (Rupert
Grint), bookish Hermione (Emma
Watson) and a now emo~ish Harry.
The other big change in Harry Pot-

the full title) is the switch from direcV
tor Chris Columbus, known best for
Home Alone, to Alphonso Cuaron,
who last directedYTu MamaTambie'n.
Cuaro’n and Scott Kloves, the screen-
writer ofaLl the Potter movies, crafted a
much tighter story from what was even
a longer novel. Gone are most of the
subplots and magical frivolities. While

compact, Cuaron still emphasizes some
small magical details, like candy that
makes you roar like a lion, that remind
us that Harry’s life is greater than ours.
Harry Potter and the dot dot dot
is the best movie in the series, While
there are only a few new faces, there
are a lot of new twists, new magic and
new scenery Sure, the mysteries are
easily solvable (consider the names
“Sirius" and “Lupin"), but you've prob
ably read the book anyway. The cast, as
always, looks the part and does a good
job following Cuart‘m's direction to act
awkmrd or weird. The Prisoner OfAZT
kaban takes what the first two films so
mediocrely established and creates not
a masterpiece, but an enjoyable 142
minutes about the magic, mischief and
misfortunes ofbeing 12 years old,

Saved (R)

The first time I saw Saved! I was
with one of my best friends, who is very
religious and very conservative. He was
muttering angry comments the whole
time,whilst I was trying to contain my
hysterical gufraws and my embarrass
ment that Igor such a kick out ofan en-
tire movie devoted to mocking people.
Saved! is, indeed, ripe with satire, tak-
ing aim at fundamentalist Christians,
who are portrayed as lcsurobscssed,
gayrl‘lating mirrors,

The movie centers on the aptly
named Mary (Jenna Malone), a devout
Christian, who receives quite the shock
when her boyfriend Dcan (Chad Faust)
confesses that he is gay. Mary takes an
unconventional approach to this revr
elation and decides (with the encour-
agement of a swimming pool main-
tenance man whom She mistakes for
Jesus) to "Cure" Dean by sleeping with
him, all the while convinced that Jesus
Will iestoie hei viiginity after her im-
portant task is finished. Instead, Dean
gets shipped on for dergayiﬁcation at
Mercy House (the name says it all) and
Mary gets pregnant. It sounds almost
too satiiical to actually be funny, but a
pretty solid, albeit mainstream, cast and
some hysterical scenes save a plot line
that could have gone very wrong.

During the course of the movie,
Mary struggles with her pregnancy,
her boyfriends homosexuality, being
ostracized by the “cool" Christian girls
and religion itself She ultimately ends
up befriending the other misﬁts in the
school and generally has a kickass time,
all the while completely infuriating
Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), the ho-
lierrthanrthou, good Christian girl who
is actually a huge bitch.

Ultimately, the movie gets heartfelt
and preachy, sacrificing its wit and bite.
The ﬁrst half of the movie I found my-
self thinking “thank God, (pun kind of
intended) someone ﬁnally had the balls
to poke fun at the Christian right." But
then the large billboard of Jesus Christ
falls on Hilary Faye's cat and the high
school misﬁts and recently liberated
Mercy House gay guys have a triums
phant scene at the prom and it all just
all works out too well. It even teaches us
lessons about life, damn them. I wanted
the movie to keep being sassy and irrev-
erent, because that’s what it does best.

However, the lastrminule mushir
ness is a small price to pay for a really
funny movie that’s long overdue. It’s a
colloquial call to arms for dirty agnostic
liberal hippies everywhere,
