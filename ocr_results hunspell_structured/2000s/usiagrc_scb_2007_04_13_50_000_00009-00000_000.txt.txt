The complications and morality of censorship

About a year ago. a soldier serving in Iraq was
taken before a m itary hearing and demoted be
cause he committed the grave sin ofwritiag about
his daily life on a blog. The blog was completely
erased. Similarly, us press has been reluctant to
publish views sympathetic to the Palestinian cause
or figures for Iraqis wounded or dead. in a country
famous for placing free speech at the forefront of
“rights" guaranteed to all citizens, and filled with
progressive liberal arts colleges which actively cu»
courage dissent and alternative viewpoints, the
continued dc facto denial of total fUZC expression
is worth considering.

Of course, I aim at
no grand analysis here.
In a boo-word column,
only so much examiiiar
tion can be done. All
the same, there is space
enough to consider the
disconnect between free speech and inﬂamma-
tory oi seditious speech. After all, many of us
think that most speech - even if offensive, unr
grammatical, and generally odious r ought to be
protected under the First Amendment. Few of us
think that this protection should extend to cover
all speech. (You don’t really mind that the us.
government national defence secrets do not come

,up on a coogle page search, do you?) Thus, there
is a vague but real idea of“ bad" speech that should
be suppressed and good speech that should be
allowed.

so, on the one hand, we have this inuchrbanr

died about notion of free speech, considered vital
to foster the type of engagement necessary fora

we suppress the espression of bad" (i c , inﬂanr
inatory and seditious) spe h we will inevitably
suppress “good" speech (i critical alternative

on the other hand, the powers that be of
ten appeal to the negative consequences of“bad"
speech to exclude some speech from free expres-
sion, But should these consequences justify the
means of their suppress

answer seems to be yes.
If the elimination of a
single word could pi
vent mass violence and
death, why not censor>
Yet, we must recogi sc
that a society that degencratcs into chaos and vror
lence because ofone word is a society in need of
healing or lots ofdiscussioa.

It is only the saddest police state which au-
tomatically censors. This, we like to think, does
not happen in our bubble of brightreycd leftist .
Here, we think about the factors involved. While
institutions may have valid reasons to censor that
have to do with keeping clear ofa certain level of
controversy that might lead to notoriety and to
maintaining a semblance of stability, censorship
requires greater justiﬁcation. Pragmatic reasons
to censor might not be the most pernicious, but

neither are they harmless and ok

to let her do so. If she uses a word for which no
case can be made and is designed to provoke witlrr

can override that and she can be duly censored.
Bur cases be‘VIII controversial \Vc would do well
to remember that in the 1980s - in Asia at least
. when women questioned the authority of bus
bands to beat up their wives, that was considered
inflammatory. In Malaysia, arguably suffering a
minisaparthcid or its own, every time someone
challenges Malay special privileges, they get arr
rested, censored, beat up - all because they engage
in seditious and inflammatory speech. instead of
trying to censor, we should ask, why do specific
words - used in the context ofa specific politi'
cal situation 7 nﬂaine? Could it be because the
level of truth in the word, how descriprivc it may
be ofa given situation, is a tad too high for as
fort? Does it evoke racisr sentiments and unfairly
characterise a given situation, making it clearly
coloured to suit one parry? Instead of censoring
a word based on primitive laws, one should look
into these questions and decide accordingly.

The point is, we cannot have a blanket rule
one way or the other. We need to think the issue
through, and engage with icTo block things out

Marseille: A long way from Grinnell, Iowa

Coming to Marseillc provided a
much-needed change of pace from
an isolated life in Grinnell. Having
never lived in a city larger than Des

to break out of my Iowan comfort
zone. speaking of far from Iowa,

Learning about Grinnell while talking to the Fed

I felt like a real, live Econ major last Tuesday,
when I received an e—mail from the Economic
Research department of the San Francisco Fed
eral Reserve Bank, requesting a telephone inter
view. Initially thrilled at the opportunrty,I felt a
sharp surge of apprehension as I considered the
reality How, exactly, was one supposed to pre-
pare for a casual phone intervrew wrtli senior Fed
economists? I clicked on the link provided and
perused the San Francisco Fed. website, Myriad
fascinating research topics flashed before my eyes.
I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work-
ing papers and my thoughts turned to the notion
of .i comprehensive macroeconomic revicw~ to
be accomplished in the coming day and a half. I
started to feel dizzy

Luckily, I was in INSLub just a few quick
steps from Carnegie, and help wasn’t far away. I
jogged up to the Econ office circle on the second
ﬂoor and swung a left. My adviser, Professot Mar-k
Montgomery, was thereto absorb the initral shock
and issue some (premature) congratulations. Over
the course ofthe next day,hc attempted to contact
ii former atlvisce who worked for the Fed for a few
years and provided some interview pointers

Montgomery, like many advisor at Giiniicll,
has made a habit of coming through in a pinch

charming, prompt and informative. That mornr

Econ majors in my inbox, with helpful comments
that ranged from Josh Pylc’s “Good luck, I’m sure
you'll do well," to Mike Gideon's and Laurie,
we all know you love to talk."

The interview itself was a comedy of errors.

made for a busy, stressful couple ofdays but in the
end I thinkI icalizcd more about Grinnell than
I learned about the Federal Resolve. This conic
mrrnity can sometimes be insular, the closeness
can occasionally feel stifling, but the support we
get here, from professors and peers alike, is truly
remarkable. I h aveti’r anv itlc i how likely I am to
get the job, but at this point I m glad they ll be in
