Th is

weekend:
Sex sex
sex...plus a
creepy girl
and a very
dashing
superhero

Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey tries
to explain human sexual-
ity while sharing air time
with a scary pale child in
The Grudge. And Joe "Sky
Captain” tries to save the
world in Sky Captain and
the World of Tomorrow.

The horror cliches come early and often
in TIM Gludgr, beginning with title curds
reading “when someone dies in the grip ora
powerful rage, a curse is born." This essen-
tialist pronouncement is as absurd as If: a
merino/id Life’s “Every time you hear a bell
ring, an angel gets its wings"—but unlike that
masterpiece, Tlve Grudge relies on this vague
pronouncement to tell its story.

77.7! Grvdgt's curse is a creepy paler
skinned. darkthaired child who goes around
scaring white people living in Japan. said vic-
tims include Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar),
an attractive exchange student living with
her attractive boyfriend, and Emma, the old
woman for whom Karen volunteers. Besides
being creepily pale, the kid also can also make
weird noises, make people hallucinate, lnltke
people die and make u delectable naneyou

have to see the DVDs deleted scenes for that
last scary trick,

American cultural displacement in Japan is
an interesting theme throughout T/Jt' Cruz/go.
It’s like Last in ’1‘1‘mirlrl/ion, only with screams
ing, This tthnophobia is apt, given that The
Grudge is a remake ofn Japanese horror ﬁlm,
although it kept the same director, Takashi
Shimlzu. He must really likc this story.

I, on the other hand, do not. i’m not a big
fan or the horror genre, and Tire Grudge does
not do much to reach out to a'wider audience.
It has none ot’rhc charm, character, humor or
novelty that cla _ like Poltergcixz, Tl): Exci-
titt or 771: Sixth Strut} possess. Its one mildly
unique trick is a confusing, Tarantino-like
fragmented storyline, jumping between time
and characters. This trick keeps the audience
somewhat interested between all the killing,
but doesn’t form any interesting characters.

T17: Grudge will probably frighten you, if
you want it to, Don’t ask for it to do much
more, though. It’s not the delectable ﬂan of
horror.

Kinsey (R)

In Dr. Alfred c. Kinsey's day, people gena
erallyassumcd that masturbation would make
you go blind or insane and homosexuality was
still thorrght or as a psychological disorder.
But Kinsey rocked the country, and eventu-
ally the world, with his provocative research
on human sexual behavior.

In Kinny, we are introduced to the man
behind the legend. The ﬁlm deals not only
with Kinsey's research and the country's reacr
tion to it, but also with his difiicult personals
ityiKinsey studied humans for much of his
life, but wasn’t very good at interacting with
them. An appealing complement to his oc-
casionally frustrating personality is his wife
Clara (Laura Linney), through whom we
grow fond of Kinsey.

Kinsey happens upon soc research almost
by accident when a young couple comes to
him for udvicbhe actually began his scir
entiﬁc career by studying gall
wasps. His ﬁrst book was pub-
lished in 1947 amid a storm
of controversy, and he subse
quently became a target for
members of congress who
were convinced he was part of
a Communist conspiracy.

Nevertheless, Kinsey press
es on, even encouraging his
staff to have set and then re-
por-t the results. He is probably
most t'anrous l‘or developing a
straightrtorgay s 'uality scale,
but his work I it] s much
farther than that, attempting
to explain an area or human
behavior that no one had ever
wanted to explore

Sky Captain and the
World of Tomorrow (PG)

When hordes of gigantic ﬂying robots
attack Ncw York, there is only one man
to callvhe Sullivan (Jude Law), the Sky
Captain. Joe teams up with Polly Perkins
(Gwyneth Paltrcw), the tcllaall reporter and
our hero's Cthove interest.

Their mission: to stop the evil Dr. Totem
kopfand his dastardly plan to rule the world.
The long-dead Sir Laurence Olivier plays
Toteukopr no part is made up entirely otarr
chive footage, which is just one more element
in the ﬂick’s unique style. The entire movie
was filmed on a soundstnge in front ofa blue—
screen, the result being real characters against
computer generated backgrounds. This has
the elrect of making the ﬁlm seem incredibly
ﬂuid, as the entire world could be created as
first time director Kerry Conran wished.

There is a very retro reel to the movie, and
memories of Superman, Lois Lane and even

James Bond come to mind as
the characters casually set out
to save the world.

Slx prominent scientists
have mysteriously disappeared,
and Polly, who rs covering the
story, is summoned by Dr.

n and the Jennings (Trevor Baxtor). He
claims he knows the cause of
the disappearances, and tears
he may be the next victim. Aft
ter receiving an important clue
. from him, Polly tracks down
Joe “Sky Captarn" and danglcs
the clue in from of him, cont
\‘inung him to take her mi as a
partner in crime-fighting.
