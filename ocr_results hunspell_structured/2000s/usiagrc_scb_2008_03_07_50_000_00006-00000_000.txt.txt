Arriving at 10 am, attendees spent the next 11 hours
watching movies, eating hobbit food and answering trivia for
prizes “The turnout was fantastic," said John Rassenfoss '10,
who helped organize the event. “We were expecting half as

many people."
The idea for event came

bitrstyle food choices awaited

the followers of the ring, chicken, beans, bread and, of course,
cheese blocks.

Once the food was devoured, a Jeopardyesque trivia contest
followed. The winners won LOTR posters, while second place
scored a Lm'd afﬁx Ring: trivia game.

As the second movie begin, the Fridayrnigl-itrhangovcr

“John and l were shopping {or three days in a row," said

“My room was packed with food, my office was packed with

The trilogy was longer than usual because Films played the
extended versions, adding about two hours of movie time. Unr
like many other film series, the Lord o/ric Rings were ﬁlmed all

like watching one movie, albeit a 11»l\our and 21-minute-long
one.

10 p.m. on a Saturday night, many students stayed to watch the
whole thing. “I love Lm‘al 13/772: Ring; and hobbit meals," said
Caroline Kory’lo, “I've never been so excited to eat this many
times in one day."

Venturing down to Lyle‘s Pub on Saturday
Feb. 23, it was hard to ignore the sounds revere
berating up through the JRC, the long line of
coats in the hallway and the constant stream of
curious snrdents. The room was packed while
student bands The Klezbians and Vegetable
Medley play; it was nearly impossible to make
it to the bar. Not bad for a basement that used
to only see crowds for tornado wainings.

The opening of Lylc's means a new vent
ue for campus bands, and Conor McGee '08,
manager, said that was always an intended use
or the space. "It’s been our goal to have this be
a place for studenr groups,whether it’s having
concerts or having art on the walls,"he said.

According to McGee, the original plans
{or Lyle's included a stage that either the pub
or Concerts would fund, but they were never
carried out. A space near the south and of the
pub was cleared for the bands, with fans filling
nearly every corncr or the space.

For the grand opening, McGee could think
of no better choice than campus favorite Vegr
etable Mcdlcy to perform. “They’re a popular
band, and we all like rhem,"he saidThc Klee»
bians, a new klcarner-style band, approached
McGee about playing, and rhe two were
scheduled together for rlie grand opening.

Both McGee and Vegetable Medley meme
bcrs tgrecd that the acoustics in Lyle's are
surprisingly good. “That show actually got

recorded by the chzbians. and the recording
came out really well,"MeGee said,

Mark D'Agostino '08, a member of Veg-
etable Medley, was also impressed. “I think it
sounded surprisingly good," he said. “The only
concern was congestion in the actual space
The tables got in the way"

McGee was pleased with how the ﬁrst show
want. “We did get a pretty good response, and
we know that people want to come to shows,"
he said

Bur don't expect there to be bands every
night. “if you have an event every night or
the week,” McGee said, “it ovel‘shadows the
fundamental purpose or the pub, which is to
provide a space for students and faculty and
the campus community in general to intemet
and chill out."

On a semirjoking note, D’Agosnno
thought that the strict ID policy for serving
alcohol affected the crowd. “Incbriated fans
are frequently good fans," he said, observing
that rhc median age or the crowd increased as
the night went on is undcragc rans left to find
more accessible sources ofalcohol.

McGee alluded to the possibility of regu-
lar events, including an additional jazz night
and a quiz night on Wednesdays, adding that
he hoped to “cultivate a symbiotic relationship
with Bob's" with regards to events and nuts. But
for now, “we're playing pretty much everything
by the seat orour pants."
