Admissions may start looking at international students’ bank accounts

“1c happens every year," explained Eric Smab, rho Asr
societc Dean of Admission and Coordinator oflntemac
tional Admission. A perfectly admissible undidatc from,
say, Malawi, who has 33000 ro commll’ to their (:dum»
riorr, applies to Grinnell. 'l'he mrrdrdare is admicrcd, and

And how does hc or she pay for rhe rest? “In marry
cultures, people will rally behind the individual,” accord.
ing co staab. “I’ve certainly seen chis many times. Com—
munities, towns, pool cheir resource and enable a sruderrc
ro come. Bur or rhc end otrheir rust ymr, they need more
money, What is die college to do?

“It can't simply give rho slud:n( the money," scaab
explained. This sends rhe message char ire srudenr scrapes
cogcrher enough to pay ror hrs or her ﬁrsr year. the oollege
will provide for thc next three—what Stub called a “very
cxpcnslve message to send "

So the student is stranded, and must work for more
char. he or she should during the amdemrc year 7 often
illegally, oirocmpus, Grades drop and pressure rises. After
all, [hn student has been sent ovcr by Iris or her entire
community, and rho expectation is that he or she wrll put

its money to good use.

To Eric stanb, rhis doesn‘t seem hair. So, for the and
several other reasons, he has proposed char th: admissions
commrrree begin evaluating inrcrrrarioml applications on
what he mils n “riccd-sensitivc" basis. under a riccdelilind
admissions policy, rrpplicarrrs arc evaluared solcly on the
basis orchcir qualiﬁcations, wrchour regard co die amount
orrrrrarrcid aid they need

In a need—aware process, however, candidates who can
pay full ruirion are given some priorrcy over candidates who
need a lot otnmnciel aid, effectively establishing higher
admissions standards for applrmms who request a high
amount oru’d.

staab believes nccdasensitivc international admissions
would allow the nominee more ﬂexibility in selecting
mndidarcs to admit, make rhe school more sclecrivcﬁood
for “ourside percepriorrs," he said—and allow the school
co “allocate the Funds in a way rhar would be more advan-
ragcous co those who We are admrrrrrrg." A ncw policy mighr
cvcn lcr rhc college loosen the lruhrurrlon limit.
