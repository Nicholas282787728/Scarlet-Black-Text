it was not a cairn night at joint Boaid on Wednesday, Eels.
20.Thc prospect ot’brrrrgirrg hip-hop artist Jean Gnu: to came
pus this Saturday generated both encitement over the concert
and lighting over where the furrdrng should come from.

Debate lasted over an hour, rnovrng through several ar tndr
moms and touching on issues of overspeudrng and an y rn
concerts The semester budgets ofrwo eornrnitrecs were taxed;
one Cabinet member reportedlv left in to is How the concert
became one ofthe biggest SG \ controre res ofthe year- boils
down to money, jurisdiction, and communication.

The concert is part of the two weekdong “Hip-Hop
Evolved syrnposrrrm Veronique Porter 08, who orgrnized the
synrposium along wrth Pat Green 09 and Spencer Green 09,
said thev wanted to brrng an originrl female hip- hop 'st to
campus. Together they discussed rvhich
female performer could effectively display
ties to the underground hiprhop culture
while srrll rnaintarning a style specifrc to
her rrnage. “I wanted a real woman emcee
who didn't have to put her senraliry out
there to be an cmcce,"said Potter.

Following the decision to bring Gme
to campus, Porter contacted Concerts
Chair Josh Lindgren '08, who said he would get in contaet wrth
Jean Grae’s label, Blacksmith Records.“ didn‘t hear from Josh
for a while so I emailed him back," said Porter. “He said he
hadn’t heard from the booking agent.” After two weeks without
a response, Porter directly contacted the label and managed to
speak directly with the vice—president ofrhe label.

Lindgren said that he had tried to bring Grae to campus
but that coordinating with the artist and her label proved too
diffreult. “We were talking for a while about how we could put
aJean Grae concert together. I tried to set it up, butJean Grae
wouldrit come," said Lindgren. “More recently Veronique was
able to get through to her."

Following her conversation with the vieepiesident. Porter
was put into contact with the manager, who asked her to send
a proposal. Porter sent a proposal of $8,000 to the label and it
was accepted after two days.

Lindgren said that Poiter was able to contactlean Grae din
rectly to work out ﬁnancial arrangements. but at that point in

the semester, there was not enough money in Concertss budget
to pay Gr “Vi/c didn't have the nroney she was lookrrrg for,"
Lirrdgr-en said.

With Concc apparently unable to tirnd Jean Cure, For
ter sought an al support from various on campus groups,
including ACE, Multicultural Affiiis, Student Affairs, CBS,
ISO, [\AC, the Ofﬁce ofDivcrsiw iuidl the Dixcrsity Stccrinu
community. Despite the lrel p of all these groups, Porter and
others were left 53, 700 short, forciniY them to "o to loin! Board
to ask fol the remainder ofthc funds,

During the Joint Board meeting at which Form and orga-
nizers asked for money, ACE Cornnnttee was eventually asked
to fund the concert T] Hawlcy 10, ACE Coordinator, said she
was surprised that the ACE budget was selected. I knew that
veronrtjue worrld he petitionrng Joint Board {or money, brrr I
did not know that it worrld be coming from
ACE, , d Hawley. “My understanding was
that , since we already recommended that
they have 52,000 for travel expenses, that the
additional money would not come from ACE
committee."

Lasrwednesday's Joint Board featured an
hour-long debate on where the money should
come front According to the minutes, 5m“,
tors fought over the r ility to spend the SGA frrnd balance and
what happens rf committees overspend. Hawley’s position was
that Concerts should fund musical activities, while Lindgren
was concerned about booking opening acts for bands.

Since the initial budget approval at Joint Board Lindgren
has volunteered extra money to pay for unforeseen equipment
costs that arose in the concerts planning.

The vote to approve the frnal split, 51,500 from ACE and
$1,215 from Concerts, passed 1274—2. Joint Board’s decision
has a grave impact on the budgets ofboth Concerts and ACE.
“51,500 is approximately eight Harris parties, rt's more than is
smdy breaks," Hawley said. “We normally do a lot offun stuff
for the atmosphere [of Harris parties that] you’ll see probably
not happening this semester."

Hawlcy emphasized, however, that she was not against the
event itself. "Hrp-hop has not gotten the attention in the past
few years that it should on the campus, and 1 think that Jean
Grae was a very important part of the symposium."

symposium,

The weekdong symposium highlighted the economic
and socml issues in envuonmentalism on the local, national,
and rnrernatronal levelsThc organizers ofrhe event, Heather
Parker ’08 and Clara Thclcn '08, In association with FTP,
aimed to raise awareness of global and local environmen-
tal justice issues through the symposium. “While studying
abroad rn Ecuador,i saw cases ofenvironmental injustice and
even racism that I had never known about," said Parker.

The symposium brought together professors and students
as speakers, with J. Montgomery Roper, Anthropology, and
Davrd Campbell, Biology, presenting on their research as did
Parker and Amy Rotllhaum ’08. There was an international
student panel discus \g environmental issues from their ten
spective home countries.

strch issues are relevant locally as well. Josh Jones of the
Iowa Sierra Club spoke on the proposed eonstruetron of a
new coal plant in Marshallrown. The issrres of globrd warmr

While the truth about environmental justice may some
times be bitter at least the honey was sweet.
