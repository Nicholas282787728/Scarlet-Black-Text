In your most recent article, “New Provin-
cial Election Law Passes in Iraq," you note
that the newest attempt of democratization
has several ﬂaws. Does this new law bring
Iraq closer to aviahle democracy, and what are
the limits to this legislation?

Well first, I think the passage of this is a
small step forward in Iraq’s complicated per
litical transition, by no means is it addressing
some of the issues
Iraqis are fighting
over when it comes
to power. It doesn't
bring it to true det
mocracy, because de—

something defined
by holding an eleer

a problem in many
places, including the previous elections in Iraq,
and in the Palestinian territories as well.

True democracy means moving towards
certain principles that have a respect for hut
man rights, the rights ofwomen and religious
minorities. This is a big problem in Iraq right
now—and people aren't talking about this—

very conservative in terms of their religious
outlook. Christian minorities have come
plaincd about the lack ofprotecrion and repre»
sentation for them; this is a core challenge in
a place like Iraq. There are broader challenges
that an election will not solve, including hu,
man rights records,

Ifyou look at the State Department's own
report on Iraq, it points to some very serious
human rights abuses by people we are support-
ing to tens of billions of dollars a yeatiyet
we're advancing freedom around the world.
People need to question these fundamentals,
and there’s a lot ofBS out there in our debate.
And in Iraq, in my point ofview, there is a high
BS factor in the political world out there, and
you just need to scratch the surface and see
that it’s a good step forward potentially, but
[there are] problern[s] still with democracy

and freedom in lrnq.

What do you think of Senator Obama‘s
plans for diplomacy in Pakistan, especially
compared to President Bush’s approach.

Vthn you look at the two candidates,
there’s a clear choice between their policies on
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, and I see a
little moie meat on the bones when it comes
to Obama, talking about Afghanistan.

When it comes to Senator MCCain,l think
when he says what he'll do is send more troops
and follow Bin Ladin to the gates of hell, it's
a very rhetorical approach to national security.
And 1 think the press has given John McCain
a free pass, because there is a presumed super
riorrty in national security and foreign policy
with him.I don't think he gets it, I don't think
he understand the 21st-century challenges like
Pakistan, and that is fundamentally a 215k

century challenge where it's not simply milie
my a ion,

I think Senator Obama talks in a much
more detailed way of how we might use legis-
lation how we reform our development as-
sistance to Pakistan and how that can be used
to actually benefit the Pakistani people, reduce
these lawless zones ofinstahility, and use other
components of American power besides the
uulirary.

Certainly Obama has talked about unilat—
eral military strikes in Pakistan. There was a
lot ofcr‘iticism ofthat, turns out it was a stator
merit of current Us administration policy. I
think he has proposed a much more nuanced
view on the issue of Pakistan and Afghanistan
than Senator McCain has,

Are there any specific issues you touched
on in your symposium?

VVell,l hope we haVe a little bit more hone
csty in the pol al debate over the costs of
this financial crisis our country is facing and
how that will impact America’s position of
power in the world. I don‘t think we’ve had
sufficiently honest debate from either of the
candidates about how they're going to adjust
their programs in light ofwhat is a potentially
large bailout of $700 billion. How are we go-
ing to restore us power in the world?

I think when historians look back on this
period, 2002 to 2008. they're going to see a
substantial decline in US power, economically,
and to some extent, militarily. I haven’t heaid
enough from either candidate how the ﬁnanr
cial numbers add up, I think there's a clear
choice in what they've proposed to do, theoret-
ically moring forcword.Who's going to pay for
it is the question that remains unanswered?

College conducts self-assessment as part of reaccreditation

BYJEFF RADERS'I'RONG

Grinnell College prides itself on its commitment to social
justice and leadership Its graduates here a history ofgoing out
into the real world and creating real change,

Ar least, that is what everyone thinks,

This past year, a group of faculty and administrators tried
to find out if that was actually true. As ri part of the college’s
rcaccreditation process. a team of professors and admiiiisrrae
tors conducted a special sclfestudy to determine how successful
Grinncll is at fostering social justice and developing srudcnts
into leaders.The study suggested the College has been success»
ful, but should focus more on “wellness"itnd public speaking.

Dean of the College Paula Smith said the sclfestudy pres
sentcd many "reaffirmed goals" the college should continue
to focus on, such as keeping financial aid a priority and rcce
ognizing Grinneil's large endowment is not the college’s only
strength.

The 20022 Reaccreditation SelfeStudy Report did point to

two specific areas for improvement—working on student for-

mal oral presentation skills, and promoting wellbcing across _

the college community. “We believe that changing the way
we thinkiot at least including thoughts of wellbeing in our
thinkingiis important to the ways that we hincrion," the re
port stated.

According to John Burrows, SGA vice president of SIUV
dent Affairs, the college has begun to address the issue or
wellheing in hiring a wellness coordinator. “The Self-Study ..
emphasize[d] the critical need to. more selt-care and an erainie
nation of how students are being stietched too thin," he said
“There might have to be a cultural shift in the way students
view wellbeingr"

l—lenry Rielz, Religion, chair of the 2008 Accreditation
Steering Committee, which oversaw the self-study said the
purpose of the selfestudy was to “reinvigorate our commitment
to training leaders in social justice."

Reaccreditation is a process the college must undertake
eveiy ten yeais. Usually for reaccrcditation, a college will in»
ternally assess themselves based on criteria established by the
Higher Learning Commission, a part ofthe North Central As
sociation ofCollcgcs and Schools which oversees accreditation
in Midwestern and South-Central states.

For this year‘s assessment, Grinnell asked permission firm
the HLC for it special emphasis on social justice leadership
“By getting approval for special emphasis, we could use the op
portunity for accreditation less as compliance and more of an
opportunity to reﬂect on ourselves and think about how we
could be doing better,” Rietz said.

The committee surveyed staff. faculty, students and alums

ni with questions about the deﬁnition of leadership and how
Grinnell helps to create students fitting that definitionThe fi-
nal report7243 pages longiwds published in July. In addition
to the results from the self-study, the report includes a history
ofrhc college and a ieporr on the othei required criteria,

“We looked at past alumni [in leadership roles] and thought
about what we are doing now to bring about big change,"
Smith s d. According to Smith, the study was generally posi—
tive. “[Tlie self-study] didn't reveal a lot ofproblems or flaws,"
Smith said.“On the whole, it found that a lot ofthings are g0,
ing well at Grilinell."

Joyce sicru '91, dean for student Academic support and
Advising, agreed with smith that the self-study did not present
any immediate problems for the administiation to solve. “But
there’s always room for improvement.” Stern said, who was it
member of the accreditation committee.

The reaccreditation representatives were on campus last
week and their final report on the college’s self-study and spe-
cial emphasis should be filed by the end ofthe semester. Smith
said the accieditors were impressed by how well the college ope
crates. “I was surprised at that, because Gr‘i nell is so quirky,"
Smith said, “It can he a messy process but it turns out to he
a well run place."
