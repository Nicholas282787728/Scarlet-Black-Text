Respect the American ﬂag

on Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2003, around 3:15 am, i walked byrhe
flagpolos on cenrrai Campns and I was appalled ar rhe sighr of rhe
flag. I saw ar leasr rhree vioiarions of rhe display of rhe us, Flag
First, ir was almosr ronehing rhe ground. Yes. is should be ar half
srafr, bur foureﬁﬁhs orrhe way down rhe pole is no longer halfsraff.
second, ir was flying below she Unired Narions flag, which is also a
violarion. Third, is was UPSIDE DOWN!

Ar 9-1 s, when i wear our again ro cenrral campus, rhe flag was
ae a proper half srsff and rhe righr side up. ir
rurns our rhar rhrs was a rhoughrless prank and
rhe marrer ofrhe UN. flag flying above ir was
an uninrenrional mistake. l am very offended

Too much stress, too much time

Students speak out
about whats on
their minds in 142
words, and you're
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at
alward@gn'nrlell.edu,
After all, complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more fun
than doing it alone.

The clock in Quad is off by about ﬁve minutes. The
artiﬁcial time zone difference has forced me to pur-
chase a watch, so that I’m not late for my morning
classes. I must mention that Wal-Mart is the Largest
watch seller' in Grinnell, so perhaps the college has
gotten in bed with anothershady megacorporation. In
addition, this localized temporal anomaly has damag~
ing effects on anyone who tries to eat breakfast di»
rectly alter an 8 a.m, class. By the time they reach
Quad, the clock usually reads 9:02, at which point the
hot line has been disposed of for ten minutes and Joy
has stopped taking new omelet orders. I don’t blame
Joy—you can’t blame someone that makes such damn
ﬁne eggs. The only remaining breakfast protein options
are cottage cheese and peanut butter. How inhumane!
The clock must be ﬁxed.

Iﬁnally understand what the complaining is about. _
I now realize why the petition for people not to do
stupid things was put up to the vote last semester. As
of this previous weekend, my hall, Read ﬁrst, reeked
ofa combination of deer musk scent and Febreeze, a
sent which is unfortunately embhzoned on my nasal
passages for the rest of my life. This, as they say, is

L the straw that broke the donkeys back. This ﬁnal

event made me realize all the moments of colossal
stupidity which occur on this campus with increasing
frequency every weekend, Events seem to revolve
around the inane antics of the mentally deﬁcient. To
make matters worse the people who perpetrated this
crime weren'treven drunk, If stupid is as stupid does,
then I’m really starting to hate the stupid "doers" on
this campus.

‘ —‘Julie Perina ‘05

What is it that makes usino make that makes
ME,—procmstinate so much?? Maybe it’sjust me, but
Iseem to have no desire to do any work on my pa—
pers, actually on any Sort of schoolwork, unless it is
DUE (readings don't even form a part of this equa-
tion) in the next two hours, You would think thatI
would start a paper early, i.e., during lunchtime, if
it’s due at 4 pm. and I have no afternoon classes.
But N000. I ﬁgure 3 p.m. is a good start for a 2-
pager. If it’s a 5- -pager due at 8 a m, pleeease, tell
me why I cannot seem to feelslressed about it until
it is 5 a m. in the morning and I'm thinking that
maybe the sentence, make that the ONLY sentence,
that I've just written is not very speciﬁc. Geeez, WHAT
A STRESS!
