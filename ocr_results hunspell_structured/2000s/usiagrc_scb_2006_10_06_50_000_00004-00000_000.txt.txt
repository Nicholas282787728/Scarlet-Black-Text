Admissions: Grinnell a place with “No Limits"

BY ERIN MCKEE

As a pinspeetive meinbei' oFthe class oi‘zmi begins to com
sider Grinnell, his m her ﬁrst look at the College may be its
glossy new Viewbook. sandmthetl nonnci professional photos.
rlie llegc informs rlie prospecrive student rliat t ‘lLlL is a lick:
wh independence or thought and social conscience are i
stilled This is “a place where there are NO LIMITS," It is, in
(net, “:i college named Grinnell."

To ille inded Grinnell siudcnt. ihe new “No Limits" theme
mighl seem cheesy Ami ovel'sllivlop, inn Admission is eons
viiieed that n is the best wry to tumor new students to the
college.

Dean of Admission Jim Sumner said that the new theme
will help rri catch studenrs‘ artcntion and get them rri consider
Grinnell. He sees the “No Limits" theme . reﬂecting the real-
iryorhi'e on campus.“ his s a place rhar c mite you wherever
you want to go." Sumner s d. “This is a launching pad." Sums
nei‘ also said the theme reﬂects Giiiiuell's open curriculum

with Grinnell overshadowed in many prospective students
minds by betteirknown East Coast schools, Sumner said that
it was important foi Grinnell to picscnt itsclfin a stiiking way.
The Vicwbook shows pictures of dancers, swlmmcls, a small
boy eating corn and a cow wearing a s. e, among other imag-
es, to suggest a “place orendless possl ies." Images oracrnal
Grinnell students and faculty are found inside foldrout ﬂaps.

The new Viewbook is 15 months old, and Sumner said it is
too early to determine its effect, “The number of applications
for the class of‘lO wcie ﬂat,” he said. “It was the same as last
yeah” Sumner also said that he did not think the Viewbook
will acrnally drive up the number ofnppllcntions, but hopes that
people will become more aware orGrinnell as a college,

Some students looking at Grinnell think that the No Limits
theme does a good job of representing Grinnell. “Grinnell gets
the word out more than most colleges," said Maddy McGuire,
prospective student. “The theme isn’t as cheesy as some of the
other ones I’ve scen.”McGuir: felt that No Limits had more to
do with academics and the fun side ofGrinncll that she hadn't
gotten from other schools materials,

Even if some prospective students might not have taken no-
ciee yet, other colleges have. snmner said that Grinnell made “a
big splash" with the Vicwbook, and Macalesrer prompriy went
out and hired the same company to make their new materials.

While the general admissions theme Came from a general

sense of what image Grinnell wanted to present, the specific
“No Limits" slogan had a more particular origin. The original
proposal was for “Unlimited Possibilities," but that had a fatal
ﬂaw, Sumner said. “It was too many syllables to string across
the Viewbook."
