Milkshakes and baby cakes

To be honest, when I said I was writing a cole
umn about science and mcdicrne iii the news, what
1 really meant was that I wanted to dredge up some
really ho ig {acts to share with lny birweekly
readers. T s week I was going to write about a
science News article that claims mariyuana smoke
crs are more likely to get periodontiris, which is a
gum disease that eventually makes your gums fall
off your teeth. But I found something way cooler.
(Stoncrs: look that one up yourselves.)

My fellow Mothers
and Infants classmates
have already experienced
the joy that is Mar/m

iririirr and How 77ng
SIM/9e r/ze Hum/i Sfurit’r,
As of chapter two, it is
mostly a collection of
random fliers about animal mothers. The fantastic
thing is that a large percentage of these racrs are
really terrifying.

Take, for example, the Australian social spin
der Dlnm ergondyar. She starts out like any other
spidery moiii— she mares, lays
some eggs. Pretty standard. But

then she starts making new eggs. Mouth agape, / was still muck on

into a milkshake. My comment in
the margin, after thinking about it
was ”oh man,"

Huge eggst Eggs with no hope or
actually making it out of her ovir
ducts. Eggs with no DNA. This is
an ominous sign. If we were in a
science fiction movie, scary alien
babies would burst out of her,
roaring triumphantly and splash—
ing green slime everywhere.

But we are not. This is nature. So something
wayyyyy ereepiet happens. 1n the words orrhe aue
thor Dr. Sarah Hrdy, “as the spiderlings mature and
begin to mill about, the mother becomes strangely
subdued. She starts to turn mushy [1!!libut in a
liquetying rather than a sentimental way, As her
tissue melts [!lll!!], her ravenous young literally
suck her up, starting with her legs and eventually
devouring the proteinrrieh eggs dissolving within
her."

Dr. Hrdy’s alarmingly dismissive reaction to
this was that “few things seem quite so antisocial
as cannibalism." And then she moved on. Mouth

atrer thinking about it for a while, was “oh man,"

This sort of thing (cannibalism) is all well and
good among spiders. Not many people are particur
laily toner of them anyway And it seems kind of
nice, mom sacrificing lierselflike that,

But even cuddly creatures eaniiibalize. And
worse, sometimes the tables are turned and morn

she eats a couple to adjust.

This mighr seem a touch
callous, but it is a good strategy
according to the “art” of iteropatiry, which Hrdy
describes as “how to breed successfully more than
once over a lifetime." Essentially, it's about hedging
your bets and having the most number of kids you
can care for while still maintaining your own health
enough to have more in the future.

As delicious as this option is, it doesn't seem
to have evolved to work that way in humans. As a
species, we’re almost all ant'rinfant cannibalizing.

Stop getting us sick

like the right thing to do, but when
you feel like you’re sick, stay in bed.
