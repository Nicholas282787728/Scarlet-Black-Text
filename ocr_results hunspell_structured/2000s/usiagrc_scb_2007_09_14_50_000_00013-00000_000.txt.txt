No one was caught at Costco buying rape
stands in bulk, and the only death mourned
was that of Charles Rogers 40 time, but it was
still far from a triumphant off-season for the
NFC North. Possibly the worst division in all
of sports,play last year was an atrocious mix of
stingy defenses, anemic offenses and the Lions.

As much as 1 wish the quality of
the division would improve with the
additions of Calvin Johnson and Adrian
Peterson, it's not going to happen.

So instead of dwelling on the ineptitude
thrust upon us (we do live in Iowa), let’s
look at the little things that will make this
year bearable. (In order of predicted finish.)

Chicago Bears
At the very least, the return of the Sex
Cannon will more than make up for the
maddeningly inconsistent play of Chicago's
“franchise quarterback” Rex Grossman (cue

hearty laugh). Bears fans may have lost their
top running back, Thomas Jones, but stepping
into his role is Cedric Benson, someone
about as injury plagued as Rocco Baldclli.

But look on the bright side, your inability
to control the clock, coupled with what
should be a large amount of turnovers Will
mean you’ll get to see your fair share of that
fantastic Bears D. I mean, as long as referees
keep letting Tommie Harris jump offside
whenever he wants, I can’t see any team
scoring more than the Chargers did (14).

At the very least, you can regress to the
virtual football world and use Dcvin Hester's
100 speed rating to run multiple kicks back
againstthe Colts to keep Grossman offtheficld.

And you should still win the division
going away anyway, so have fun this season.

Detroit Lions

1 am firmlyon the Lions bandwagon. Their
season will he an amazingly entertaining train
wreck, and like Eddie Griffin, I’m barrcling
full speed towards it. Fortunately, Matt Millen
is still there, still proof ofMurphy’s Law and
still trying to bring them down from the
inside. How else can you explain giving the
fifthsbest defensive tackle in the division, Cory
Redding, the richest contract for that position
in NFL history? Millen makes me cherish
the time I’ve spent with Kevin McHale.

Luckily for Lions fans, they might
have found themselves this year's impact
rookie. Like last year’s key rookie Reggie
Bush, Calvin Johnson was passed on by the

Raiders as the number one pick in favor of
LSU stal quarterback JaMarcus Russell,
even though Johnson has more talent.

Unlike Bush, Russell wasn‘t passed on
because he would be rough to sign, out
because Oakland obviously wanted a fatter,
less mobile and greed‘ler version of Daunte
Culpepper. This explains why when the
Raiders finally realized signing Russell
wouldn't be easy, they justwent out and signed
a fatter and less mobile Daunte culpepper,

Green Bay Packers

Full disclosure:I hate the Packers and I hate
Brett Favtc. That said,I hope Brett Favre stays
in Green Bay for the next 10 years. His love
of the game and fearlessness when trying to
squeeze a pass between two or three defenders
is unparalleled in the history of professional
football, my the world. Even when John
Madden openly fellates him on national
television,I don’t get upset, I justsmilc and pray
that I will never see a day when he gets dragged
off that field. Sure, the sheer mediocrity of
the NFC North will never overwhelm them.
They may even eke out a playoff berth. But
Favre’s arm strength is waning, his decision
making skills are atrocious and as long as
he’s in the lineup the Packers can never fully
rebuild. The best thing for Packer fans would
be for Brian Urlacher to go all Kimo von
Oelhol‘fen on Favre's leg so that both literal
and metaphorical healing can ﬁnally begin,

MinnesoiaVikings

The Vikings are going 3-13 this year,
the Vikings are going 3d; this year, the
Vikings are going 343 this year. I need to
keep reminding myself or this. otherwise,
I get consumed by irrational optimism,

Sure, the defense should be outstandingand
Marcus MeCanley's emergence at Corner will
allow Antoine Winfield to utilize his tackling
abilities by playing on the inside (I think that
sentencejustdmvcmytemainingreadersawaylt

And yes, RB Adrian “Purple Jesus"
Peterson, barring injury, should be a top
contender for Offensive Rookie of the Year.
But then I need to realize m3 Tarvaris Jackson
has no experience and head coach/Major Dad
impersonator Brad Childress has no idea
how to manage a game. Not to mention the
Vikings “big” free agent pickup, and expected
starter, is a wide receiver reject from the
Tennessee Titans. Wait, what? Randy Moss
had 183 yards receiving for the Patriots?
Time to break out the Cris Caner jersey.

However, I just can’t shake that feeling, a
feeling I get every year that the Vikings are
going to surprise, make the playoffs and finally
win a super Bowl. This optimism grows
through the first four weeks or the season
until the unavoidable Week Six blowout by
the Bears at Soldier Field shatters all hope.

With football season then over,
I can only ask theat inevitable
October question: hocke , anyone?
