School board election candidates face off Sept. 1 3

BY LoLA GARCIA

With fall fast approaching, thc Grinncll community is pres
paring itsclt‘for an exciting election.

No, not that one,

Against the backdrop of highsdtama national politics, the
GrinncllsNewburg School Board has an interesting election
right here in town. There are three seats up for grabs on the
board. While {our of the board’s seven seats are selected to rep-
resent a director district, ensuring some geographical diversity
on the board, every Grinncll voter registered by September 3
will have the chance to vote on each director district seat up for
election on September 13,

The most watched race will be between incumbent Vicki
DeAngelo and challenger Brent Hendricks.

DeAngelo, a resident ofcrinncll for 18 years, is running for
her third threeyear term. She ﬁrst decided to run sir years ago
when her kids were in GrinncllsNewburg public schools and
the incumbent school board member in her district decided not
to run for reelection, She ran because she was “hoping to see
improvement“ in school funding.

“1 had always been very involved in [the schools] my chil—
dren were in,”she said. She first became involved on the district
level by getting involved in a local bond issue.

While on the board, DcAngclo cites the building projects
she helped organize as one ofhcr main accomplishments'rhe
main project took almost 13 years to piece together and was
ﬁnally approved while she was in ofﬁce.

She and the board also oversaw the introduction ofall-day
every-day kindergarten and the “reignitingl of the school's vols
unteer program, which had become very limited after recent
budget cuts. She says she has enjoyed working on a “balanced"
school board, where “we all have seven different opinions, but
we all work for the common good.”

Hendricks also has two children in the public school sySs
tcm, but that isn't the only reason he thought it was important
to become a candidate. “I'm a participant because my kids are
in school." he said, “but I’m a participant because I own prop-

erty and I’m a taxpayer."

He chose to run because he sees it as one way to bccome
involved in participatory government. ‘fNol everyone likes the
decisions made," he said, “and if you're not willing to gct in,

\lolved you lose some voice," He picked the School Boaid be
cause he believes it has “a ﬁduciary responsibility that is very
high.,,wlien spending other people’s money and educating
their children."

According to the August 23 issue of the Grinncll Her-
ald-Registet, Hendlicks ﬁrst became involved in school board
politics several years ago, when he disagreed with a proposal to
secularizc school Christmas celebrations.

“Ofcourse you can’t have Christmas without Christ,"Hens
dticks said, but for him, the real issue at
that meeting was the school board lying
about their motives for eliminating the
school’s gift exchange by painting it as an
economic issue. “It’s a non-issue today,"hc
said "The paradigm is that it's important
to be horicstrThat's what] teach my kids:
integrity”

His campaign has been decidedly loWs
budget and straight forward. He said his
main strategies are door-to-door, depend- .
ing on word-of—mouth and putting an ad
in the paper and a sign in his yard on East St, “I've lived in
town a long time, a lot of people he know me." he said about
his simple campaign strategy

Hendricks says he feels no speciﬁc pressure to win. “I have
no problems with any speciﬁc decisions that Vicki has made,"
he said. And even ifhe loses, he says he “has no doubt the board
will be in good hands."

DeAngclo was equally cordial. "I have nothing bad to say
about him," she says of Hendricks, who she met when their
sons were in Boy Scouts.

This is not to say that Hendricks doesn‘t have goals it’ he
does get elected. "I believe the board shouldn't be an activist
boardt..[or a] minor points board," he said. He would like to
see the board retreat so that it does “nothing beyond" its most
mandatory dectsions, primarily hiring and ﬁring administras
tors and acting as a ﬁnal arbiter in disputes. He would like to
see the board be “diligent and reserved in its spcndingt"

DeAngelo has her owil objectives for a potential third
tcrm, mainly “I want to see building projects finished." After
last year's bond issue passed, the board secured $12 million to

complete the building project. “I want to be there when they
cut that ribbon."

A Grinncll College employee has also put his hat into the
ring. Director of social commitment Doug Cutchins is runs
ning unopposed tor the Grinnell School Board Seat in the
fourth director ClISUlCL

Despite his job at the college, cutchins has no intentions
ofrunn'lng on his college connections. “I’m not going to be the
Grinncll College member of the Grinncll School Board," he
told the S88.

Rather, cutchins emphasizes his cons
necrions to the larger Grinncll community.
“Having livcd here for a number ofyeats...
the [Grinncll] community is really impor
tant to me,"said Cutchins and he is ready to
“play an important role” in the community.
Cutchins has been involved in the Grinncll
United way, serving as the president of the
organization (or the last two ycars.

Besides his experience at the college and
in community serv'tcs, Cutchins has had
first-hand experience with public education, Before coming to
Grinncll, Cutchins taught high school for three years, one of
which was spent in nearby Newton, lowa. “[Public education}
is something i have thought about and have experience with."

Cutchlns has several reasons for running, but one of the
main reasons is his two young daughters. “It is kind of self
ish," he said, “I want them to go to the best schools they pos-
sibly can." His older daughter Emma will start in the Grin-
nellsNewburg Public Schools around the time her father will
assumedly take ofﬁce.

Running unopposed, cutchins admits he hasn't done much
campaigning, His main campaign plans are to send out a brOs
chure a week before the election.“I had a huge campaign plan,"
he saidThat plan was scrapped once he found out he was runs
ning unopposed. “[That] campaign plans cost a lot of money."
Money, Cutchins says, that is better spent on other, contested
races.
