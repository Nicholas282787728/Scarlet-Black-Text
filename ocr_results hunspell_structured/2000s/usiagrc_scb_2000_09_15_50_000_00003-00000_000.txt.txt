Grinncll's drop from lltll to 14th in the ([5. New:
«ml WIN Repairs rankings will not oirecr next years in-
eorning class, admimsrrarors say.

“I think it's clear that a lot of American high sChDOl
students read [the rankings] and are affected by them. and
to that extent I assume that they hnve some erreer on us,
but w: don't measure ourselves by the rnnklngs," President
Russell Osgood said,

Alrhough rhe rankings nre used by mnny high sehool
srudenrs as a rool Cor researching poronrial colleges, rho
adminisrrarlon says that she decli '
sigmheanr negative arrest on this year's applicant pool.

“I’d be htmlrptesscd to believe rhar any srudenrs or
the caliber wt: would expect to apply and be admined would
ultimately make a decision WhL‘tl’lEf or not to attend
Grinncll bascd on [she ranking." Mickey Munlcy '57, di»
recror orpublie relations, said.

The administration states that the US. Nam rankings
are not a major inﬂuence when derermimng how to im—
prove the aeademie environment and make progress.

“Grinnell seeks and aspires ro be she best possible na—
tlomll liberal arts :dlool it can he hated upon excellence as
we deﬁne it," Munlcy said. Our litmus trst for making
strategic decisions abour how ro move rhis couege forward
is based solely upon our mission and.. .thc Grinncll nadir

Aceording to lim Sumner, dean of admission and ﬁ-
nanclal nid, it appears runs, for moss srudenrs, the us.
News rankings are nor used as mueh in choosing a college
as they are in exploring porenrial college options and narr
rowing down long lisrs.

Srudenrs agree that although rho us. Nru/t rankings
were a valuable resource in selrclung for schools. the rank
ofthe individual schools mattered little when the ﬁnal de-
Clsion was made to attend Grinnell.
