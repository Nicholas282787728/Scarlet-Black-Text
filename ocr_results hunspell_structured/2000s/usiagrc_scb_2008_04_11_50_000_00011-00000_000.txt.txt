Stepping stones

Golf team works together towards successful season

BY CHLOE MORYL

Last Tuesday, Carlos Lu ’10 tied for third
at rhe Simpson College spring Invitational.
The weekend before, Pete Kjeselbach ’10 shot
a 149 over a two-day meet to finish in eighth.
The Grinnell Men's Golftenm has been prac-
ticing hard and stepping up their game to uni
expected heights.

“We've been averaging around 70 as a
team," said Lu, “which is way better than
we're used to.We‘re playing better now than
we did at conference last

looked at for the ﬁfth and sixth man,” said
RJ Roewe ’08.

Additionally, as coach Jaworski is set
tl'mg into his second year as golf coaeh, he's
had more time and opportunities to get to
know the players as individuals and as a
team.“He’s one guy thar knows how to bring
a bunch of random guys together as a unit,"
said Roewc. “We experience that on spring
break at Tucson, when we play inrrarnnral
basketball, and at pracrice every day.”

Lu agrees that in his

years" ”Though [fwd] JﬂWWX/(U second year, Coach Jaws

Bur what has sparked

has done a good job of

rhc Pioneers to such a maynolbeab/elobealu: stepping into the posts
strong performance? “ ant/lemme Mag/ear tion of golf coachr “He's

We've or two reat ca -

tains ingRJ [Rani] and lie leader,”
Fox,” said Lu. “Their leads

ership, along with Coach

Jaws, and the ﬁI’SPyeﬂIS

stepping up. it’s all going to

load to a strong season."

Personally, R] Room: ’03 attributes his
improvement with getting older and the
chance to play more collegiate level golf.“1t's
been a big progression. First year I was the
seventh man, but then sophomore and jun
nior year I'm one of the top three golfers on
the team," said Roewc. “With that transition
has come a lot ofconﬁdence; l'rn playing rho
best golfl’ve ever played,"

Two first years, speciﬁcally, are be-
ing looked at as key members of rhe team.
“Alex [McDonald] and Jeff [Kljaich] will be

deﬁnitely a lot more corn-
forrablc coaching as," said
Lu. “Thouin he may not
be able to heat as on the

Brigitte Anthony’OS course, he’s a grear leader,“

added Roewe.
In the coming weeks,
Jaworski's leadership Will be essential to the
Pioneers as they face many difficult matches
“The next couple ofweeks, the tournaments
we’re playing in are wirh much hctrcr compe-
tition, much tougher golfers than we’re used
to," said Lu. “Ifwc can step up and compete
will! them, we should have no trouble when
conference comes around.”
The men’s golf team plays next at the
Wartburg Invitational in Waverly, IA April
12-13.
