Wind turbines project ensues W

BY LIZA LEAS

“’1le energy at Gnnnell has been given a new burst of
lite, as turbines go up for Auction ar fractions orrhe original
price and Grinnell’s Institutional Planning works to nnirteae
the project.

When the endowment dropped, Grinncll put capital
projects on hold, including promises to construct windmills
for the campus. Although the College had been worlong to
bring wind energy to the school for more than {our years, no
construction had begun—Grinnell was left with one small
turbine at Conrad Environmental Research Area (CERA),
and no immediate plans tor newer, large—scale turbines.

“As we were working on lease sites [for the turbines], the
market went way down, the endowment went down and the
trustees froze new capital projects,’ said President ofth: Cole
lege RussellK Osgood

Though the recession has slowed the process oracquiring
turbines, the college has yet to lose all hope ofﬁnding wind
turbines. Since the wind turbine market also suffered in the
recession, owners are nowroffering them at 50 to 80 percent
discounts.

“We had estimated that the turbines would cost about
:3 million originally," Osgood said. “There was an auction
estimate that they might go for $1.5 million."

The decrease in price has reignited hope within the col
leg: administration. "From being discouraged, I'm pretty ext
cited that this all just happened," Osgood said. “$1.5 million
is a lot easier to get than [$3 million]."

However, acquiring this amount of money will still prove
difﬁcult. Due to the endowment freeze, Grinnell is seeking
private donors to fund the turbines.

"were going have to look really hard at where we can ﬁnd
those funds and ifwc can find [them]," said Vice President
of Institutional Planning Marci Sorter. “It would be really
exciting ifsomeonc said, ‘Wow, this is a great time to help
the college.“

It’s also possible thit Ihc Gunncll College Boald of
Trnstees will agree to tuud the wind turbines. Osgood and
Sol-tor are discussing the new opportunities with the trustees,
using the large discounts as persuasion.

“if [the trustees] say, ‘Yes go nhcnd,'tllcn we’ll start going
to these auctions and seeing what we can get," Osgood said,

“If we can ﬁnd [11: funds this is deﬁnitely the time to
move," Sortor said,

Thc $5 million not spent on turbines will go to leasing
space, laying cable and other construction costs. The college
has plans to run studies examining the impacts on the envi»
ronment, birds and cultural resources.

The leasing process proves to be dirriculrecrinnell has
been unable to secure all the spots that it wanted, because
some of the lmldowncrs wcrc more hesitant to lease their
land than was expected, according to Sortor.

“It has turned out that we have not gotten all of the pos-
sible lease sites that we would like, so we continue to work on
that," Osgood said. “Although we are close to being able to
nail down the sites."

The_entire process has been arduous, not including the
complications arising from the reeession.This has displeased
some Grinneuians, who have voiced their opinions through
the No Limits Project (NLP) and Free the Planet (FTP).

“All the students who have worked on the project want to
see it happen and want to see it happen soon,",said a member
ofboth NLP and FTP, Nathan Pavlovic ‘10.

NLP speciﬁcally took issue with a “ Farmers of ingenuity"
advertisement that implied that Grinnell already had large
turbines.

“The college is being premature in putting up advertise
ing," said Pavlovic. “Ifthe College is going to be that hasty,it
should pick up the pace [in constructing the turbines].“

With the recent decrease in price, it should be possible
to pick up the pace—Grinnell has the chance to reafﬁrm its
commitment to environmentalism.
