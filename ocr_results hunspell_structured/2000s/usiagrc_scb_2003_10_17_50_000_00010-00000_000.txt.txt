Thank you

l wanred ro rhank rhe 2002.03 5m; srafffor last years ﬁnal is
sues and especially for.rhe edirorial whieh discussed rhe many mental
issues rhe sraffalone had experieneed during rheir rime ar Grinnell.
This openness ahour depresion, menral illness and simply Coping is
rhe kind ofdialogue whish should oecur herween srudenrs. faculry,
sralf. and adminisriarorseand more imporranrly, herween friends.
Though rhe desire ro seek counseling is a privare manor, ir should he
neirher a souree ofemharrassmeur nor a eause for isolarion. i didn’t
rmeh our ro my friends as much as 1 probably should have. eirher
when l or when rhey needed help. We never ralked shour menial
healrh eenrer visirs. Usually we were jnsr roo husye praerire ran over,
had a ron of reading ro do, “Friends" was on, wharever. Where were
we supposed ro souoeae in menral health—ova dinner as Cowles? Yes,
smirk/y. Orwherevcr is is you finda momenr, because rhe more we all
open up and say whar we’re ieally feeling and who iris we’r: seeing,
rhe less any one ofus feels they’re suffering alone. All of us realize
rhar everyone's gor a lor ofhomework; how long unril we realize rhar
we've gor a lor of issues (or “baggage," as rhe edirorial srares) as well—
and rhar that’s okay? How orren, heeause or‘husyness," have you
denied yourselfrheeonversarion/eounselinglrwo more hours ofsleep
rhar you're eorrain would improve your mood and ovenll wellhe—
ing? Why do we lei ourselves and our friends go on like this? Why
are we roo “lousy” ro rake rare ofeach other?

Though her years newspaper staff may have oallod rhemselves
rhe “craziesr oimpus group" (andl worked wirh many ofti-lcm _ and
polirely refmin from oommenr), I am haidepressed ro d-iink ofa more.
srahle campus group: theme? Grinncll Smgers? Free rho Pinned?
SGA? lrhink oaeh ofrhese crass-sections ofstudcnt life would reveal
a similar monralhealrh breakdown as rhar ourlined in rhe edirorial.
Perhaps rhe only group rhar would nor in rhis profile is campus

Addirionally i would love ro hear rhar xmdcnls’ menral healda
and w:li»being hirs rhe radar when professors are developing syllahi
and reading lisrs. l rememher when seleering herween srudy.ahroad
progiams rhar one rliing re eonsider was rho amounr of “eulrural
rime" (whar really amounrs ro "free rime") rhar one has on do pro.
gram, siiiee ir is generally undersrood rhar mosr of rho imporranr
experienoes one has while in a different eulrure do nor happen in rhe
classroom. Refleering on ihis, l wondered why rhe same professors
who endorsed rhrse plogmns did norseem ro eonsider “eulrural rirne"
ar crinnell when making rheir own assignmenr lisrs. l don'r mean ro
suggesr rhar professors are insensirive ro rheir srudenrs’ welleheing,
but I do feel rhar rhe woikaholie arademie environmenr ofren forces
srudenrs ro choose herween healrhy and unliealrliy choices. This is
nor simply a quesrion of rime managemenr or proeiasrinarion. if
one were considering assigning 30 pages vs. so pages, would ir help
so rhink, “IfI assign fewer pages, all of my srudenrs eouid have a
eounseling session or workour rhey need insiead.>" Whar if every
professor eonseiously did rhis in rheir elasses onoe per week? l wanr
ro suggesr here rhai srudenr menral healrh is nor iusr an issue for
srudenr aKails, nor ,usr somerhing rhar goes on in rhe dorms. our of
elassroom doors and afrer ofhee hours: ir is somerhing rhar is intie
marely eonneered ro rhe hears ofwhy we some so Grinnell college
ro srudy and learn, As mneh as we learn hisrory, economies, physies.
and French, we musr also learn how ro live as healrhy individuals.
Sriidenrs orren don’t have rhe rime rhey need so seek diey lielp rhey
desire. professors musr help in rhis e ro he rho “moral models" Sam
Rehelsky suggesrs rhey are. Bur srill rhe quandary exise 7 how we
walk rhar fine line herween allowing srudenn ro halanee aeademie
and soeial growrh in posirive ways and in some my (perhaps only
psychologimlly) weakening audemics or deprh ofsrudy wirhin a
ﬁeld?

Finally, 1 would like ro add rhar rhough many ofrhe srudenr and
faeulry edirorials were moving, l found Mark Baechrcl’s especially so.
He exmsscd well rhe humaniry of sueh rragedy, and I was grearly
impressed wirh his willingness ro addros suicide on his own, per.
sonal levcl. His words reached our ro me (graduared and across rhe
oeean) as I rried ro learn more ahour rhe cvenrs and grieve for my
friends on.eampus and offa

Thanks again ro everyone involved in rhe produerion orspring
2003's ﬁnnl isme, for ham-st macIion and moving tnburc which Ful'r
rher rhe aeeepranee of menral illness and counseling i believe we all
