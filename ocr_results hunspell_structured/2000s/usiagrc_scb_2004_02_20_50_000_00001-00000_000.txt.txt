Last serurdey nighr herween rhe hours of 12 and 4
a.m.. the Grinnell Police Department cited two studenn.
and mede one erresr for possession ofrnenjuene. Delwin
“Pink" Pinklns ‘06 was arrested after police were called
and obtained a warrant to search his room.

The srudenrr reporredly hed e ierge emounr of nieriiuene

Th: Xeculiry ofﬁcer made a decision to call the police
and Residence Life Coordinator Tim Eoslcrs Aftcr an of-

Both Crady and Associate Dean for Studcnt 1.ti
Mieheel Sims errended rhis wcek’s ioinr Botud meeiing ro
listcn ro srudenr eoneerns about rhe ineidenr. Upwards or
so srudenrs showed up ro voice rheir opinions Wednesday
nighr

chcrai students complained that the decision to call
rhe police was ineonsisrenr with generel college preenees.
Cradywas irnrnedierely defensive. “It’s ehsolurely oui righr
ro rail rhe polire erenyrirne," he seid, “[if] you wenr us to
he eonsisrenr, its going to he eeio.roierenee."

He lerer erphined that redeiel law requires the college
to enroree srere low end impose disciplinary sanctions.
“What I would say about the Feds is that wc’rc in [between]
a rock and a hard place. If we don’t follow [thc law] our
federal funding is in jeopardy”

Cmdy poinred ro rhe fact rher, for rhe mosr perr. rhe
edininisrisiion has avoided eelling rhe police, “I’ve heen
hctc 21 ycais," he said. “and [a studcnt has been arrcstcd]
only five rirner."

Several students voiccd major concerns about a breach

srudenr was qulckly cut off hy credy. “If you're going in
talk seitgovernenee, it does not give you th: righr to break
the law," he said.

But some students found other aspccts ofthc case dise
turbing. “I [col like this has a lot of mcial overtones," said
one strident. “I'm sketched out about all ofthls."

Of the three students confronted in Younker lounge
Pinkins, e black srudenr, wes the only erresi mode. The
orher two srudenrs. horh whire, were given eirerions.

Neirher or rhe edrninisrrerors wes quick ro jump to
eonelusions. “i'm not seying it’s righr, l’rn nor seying irs
not discrimination [but] thesc this: cues are not th:
same." said Sims.

Some- siudcnrs were also cautious before assuming the
