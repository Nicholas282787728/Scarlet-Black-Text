Change the SAT?

Grinnell officials report mixed
reactions to College Board proposal

by Michael Andersen
Staff Writer

The college Board is planning a mayor overhaul of
its Scholastic Assessment-Lest by 2005. ii was reported
lasr month verbal analogies may be replaced wirli a
writing snmplc: rhc marh secrion may require more ad»
vanced knowledge.

Such changes would move the rest, in (hL‘ parlance
or the indusny. away from “aptitude" resting and to»
ward “achievement" testing; away from intelligence and
roward knowehow.

The nonpronr corporation rhar writes rho SAT has
come under recent criticism For its methods of assess-
mcnr, which some believe to be matcurate and possibly
biased toward wealthy, White suburbanircs, Last year,
the presidents of [hC Universities of California recom-
mended rhar rhc I78,000»srudcnt system srop using the
test, and a UC faculty group rcccnrly echoed his con-
clusion,

College Board rcprcscnrarivcs said rhosc proposals
were intended as a response [0 UC criticism Grinncll
adminisrrarorshad mixed reacrions, though all said they
still know rclarivcly liirlc about the issue.

“On The marh side, ir makes especially good sense,"
said jin-i Sumner, dcan ofAdmissions. “The current SAT
mcasurcs only your abiliry in arirhmeric, algebra and
geometry." Many Grinncll Students, he said, enror rhe
college wrrh calculus experience, so ShTs convoy minr
rivcly limited information about potential Grinncllians’
marhomarical ability.

I’rcsidciir Russell Osgood. however. worried that the
changes might leave some students behind.

“I rhink rhoro‘s some risks in changing rhe math
pan." he said. “You may disadvantage rui-al students,
who tend to have less complex math courses available
to thcmiand. by the way, real innenciry urban sxw
denrs.”

Osgood added rhar Grinnell, an early supporrcr or
the alternative ACT. might be less affected than some
schools.

Russell Coward, Education. worried that a writing
sample on a srandardncd rcsr would be impropcily evalur
:red, rurrhcr increasing score bias.

Sumner said he hoped rhc test would remain Fair,
and generally saw rhc proposed changes as improve-
incurs.
