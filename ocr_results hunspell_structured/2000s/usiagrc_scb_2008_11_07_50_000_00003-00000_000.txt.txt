Observers generally said that Election Day 111 Gnnnell
ran smoothly, which Harriet Adelberg, .1 volunteer Den-lo-
cratic poll watcher, attributed the smoothness to the county
workers. Accordmg to poll workers there were no challenges
in the ﬁrst ward Election Day.

“0111‘ election oflicials bend over backwards to make sure

students are against this decision, but the demand is high
enough that we must consider the opnon," she said. Tire frnal
decision would take into consideration results of a student
poll currently available on Pioneerweb.

“We don't want this to be it decision that the students
think rhe adrninisrrarion makes completelya1'bitt'cu‘ily,"But-

be taken into Consideration with other factors."

“It’s great, the calm and quiet environment, which really
helps me in my religious practices andl can always be guar-
anteed a good environment for studying, so I never have to go
to the library,‘ Yu said.

As an alternative to Creating a new sub- free dorm on
campus, Langc pointed to situations similar to Yus us an
area for the College to improve. “Although idealistic, it is my
wish that insread ofrnaking another dorm sub- free to better
screen who exactly mots to be' in sub free housing,’ he said
Lange also said tl'lat many students request sub- free housing
on their upplicaL'ton forms only to adopt a decidedly not sub-
free lifestyle after being on campus.

Burrows said that while this is common, it does not ab-
rogate the College’s responsibility to provide adequate subs
free housing. "There deﬁnitely is a dropoff in students 11111
request sub-free in their first year here to their second year.
But the survey’s supposed to reﬂect and respect their lifestyle
choices at the time that they take the survey, Burrows said.
We don’t mat to tell the incoming student ‘trust as, you’re
going to end up drinking."

FAC to students: Love Your Body

llY O\l.\lt MUNOZ

rvlasrurbanon, streaking and pornography all intersected
this past we k as the Feminist Action Coalition (PAC) again
hosted its annual Love Your Body (m3) week.

Through workshops and discussions FAC provided students
with forums to tackle topics ranging from feminisi pornogra—
phy and masturbation to gcndcr identiﬁcation and body image.
The week will be capped tonight with the QPOCesponsorcd
Drag Show.

One of the drilling Forces behind activities this week is the
desire to provrde challenging perspecrives of traditional ideas
about the body

“LYB wcclt starts a discussion about how society yictvs our
bodies, how we view them, and why society‘s- views aren’t always
correct," said Jessica Sontliard ’10, one of the organizers of the
events. “[1] hope patticlpants gained the tools to deconsrrucr
dominant views about the body rhrough gender, race and class,"
she said.

Tuesday inglu, Rebeccr Genres '09 led “naked yoga," :1 new
LYB event, which was well attended, accordrng 1o Gei'nes. “Na»
kcd Yoga f11 really well with Love Your Body week, nor only
c 111g for the body,"shc said, “but appreciaiing what it can do
at the moment."

The; week's events also included two masturbation works
shops—one for males and another for females—which are a
popular attraction of LYB. According to Brian 17:1er '09, 11
workshop lc1dcr,rhc workshops provide students with an open
space to talk about a topic that typically carries signiﬁcant tar
boo in mainstream society. Pcrbix s‘ d one of rho goals of the
workshop was "[to] help people think critically about social
forces that shape ideas about your body."

On Tuesday organizers held an open discussion called “
ots No1 Diels,"to examine abour body image and ableism.T 1e
discussion was led by Emma Lawler '09, who last year edited a
book entitled Rio/r Na! Dior, 1 Collection of phorographs and
personal accounts of Grinnell students addressing body image
and society. “The book was a space to tall: abour pcrspccrives.
Narrative is an important part of loving your body and talking
about body movenrcnes." she said,

Lawler also said that "ableism
is something people have a difﬁcult
one talking aboutl It's 1 para ofpco-
ple's life they can't articulate."

Given the number ofevents
and the level cfpariiciparion, organiz-
ers said the week was a success. “The
fact that we’re sparking a discussion
will make [participants] reconsider incorrect ideas about the
body,’1 said Hannah Caster’lO, another LYB organizer. “And if
people start talking about 111m then it was a success."

Others said a challenge still remains in transforms

’.’,. it’s lmpa/lanl to recognize and
adept [your body] and love ll. ”

ing the ideas presented ideas during LYB week into acrion.

“The basis of any action 1s having a real commu-
nity which leads to a much larger path that leads
ro acrion. People can take action on personal basis,"
Lawler said. "Discussion is something that needs
to happen beforehand Creation of community is a
huge step to creating action."

FAC members said they are conﬁdent the
rhar experiences and conversarlons this week can
afreci change as people are motivated and given the
opportunity to pursue more ambitious goals "Finding a way to
accept your body the way it is its important to recognize and
accept it and to love it,’ said Caster

I think one of the more notable traits
of Nixon was when he was in his formative
years, any opposition would only harden his
beliefs. Could we apply this to the conservac
tive base, who confront the reformers by say-
ing, “No, we're not trying hard enough?"

The thing about Nixon which makes him
ifnor unique, ptotorypical,was that he had no
ﬁxed ideological princrples. especrally when 11
came to domestic affairs. But one rhing that
Nixon would have never. evei, ever recome
mended was the idea that Republicans need
to redeem themselves with more ideological
purity. He saw things very clearly, stringently,
and unsentimentally, saying that if something
failed, you throw 11 out. To the extent to whrch

provoke backlash [that evenrnally bronghi
in Nixon]. could you see a situation where
Obama could go too far and provoke the
same kind ofreactjon?

11's 1 very different poluical context. In the
60's, liberals came to power when America was
wealrhier than any civilization in the history
of man, and 11 looked like u would connnue
forever. They never really took into aceounr
1h: psychologreal costs of that social change
among people who valued stability and tiac
dition. Liberals have learned from them and
rhose like Barack Obarnn have a much more
scnsirive antenna for what’s possrble and mow
ing public opinion.

There’s a lot of talk about all 11111 has
changed in the culture war, but I was wonc

Acnrally, his remarkable how successful
Barack Obama has been in breaking this up.
11ch made inroads in the evangelical come
lntinlty, he’s proven that people can face doWn
fears ofpcople named Hussein, and he's broe
ken this anonishing racial barrier, I think that
handamental cultural and economic conﬂicts

rhe Republican Party succeeds in the future is
the extent to which they’re able to have the
courage to confront these core principles and
notjusr say that if we apply these things more
forcefully, we‘ll win,

But that [hardlinc] approach has some ad-
vantages in politics. You’re willing to work 20

bur 10 years ago 11 lost by 12 points, and next
time it will probably win, but by then there
might be some whole new conflict.
