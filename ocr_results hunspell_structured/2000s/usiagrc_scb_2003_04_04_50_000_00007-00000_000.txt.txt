We checked the room of Phil Ehresmann ’05.

llorthheld, Minn. At one other end or the road was this Endwuod
Trail sign. The reason that its all hent up like that is heeause I
accidentally ran over it vn'th my ear at one point.” z) "This is the
lort that my dad built me over Fall Break. It doesn't make any
noise—that's key. The make-out futon is underneath. Yil leave the
origin of its name up to your imagination. i have Christmas lights
on my lott, so when the rest or the lights are out, its quite the
effect. You tell me that doesn't turn you on. its pretty sweet." 3)
”This is a map or Ecuador, where l was an exchange student for a
year after hlgh school. i lived in ruerto Villain. My wall now has a
Central and South American fetish.” A) “I planned on using the
patio a lot at the beginning or the semester, but it ended up being
a hassle going in and out of the mndow. The ﬂamingos make the
patio. Although there's a lot or snow outside making it hard to see,
there is hstroturr too." 5) "1 have a eouple sturred animals, just
