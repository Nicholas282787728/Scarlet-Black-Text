SHE: What has your study of conﬂict resolution
been like?

Campbell-Patton: We study different causes for
war and the ways to aehieve peaee. You can work with
top-level government leaders, at the middle with relia
gious leaders and traditional leaders and at the grass»
roots level with different educational programs that
effeer ehange.

sero- Does the U.S. government have any inter-
est in Uganda?

Campbell—Patton: Uganda has been sort ofeited
as a successful development story and gotten a lot of
foreign aid. In faer, the southern region has develr
oped quite a lot and the AIDS rate has dropped. But
the fact that a civil war is going on there is basically
ignored.

[Ugandan] President [Yoweri Kaguta] Musev—
eni does not want to bring attention to it because he
doesn’t want to jeopardize support from other couna
tries that.view Uganda as a success.

SE63: Did you ever discuss whether the US.
should be involved in that reconciliation process?

Campbell—Patton: At a certain point we asked
some of the Ugandans whether they wanted the U.S.
to bring troops to Uganda and we [Americans] were
surprised that they said yes. The reality is the U.S.

doesn’t have strategic interest and won’t send troops.

was Do you feel as though anything was being
kept hidden from you during your visit?

Campbellrpntton: I don't think the people 1 was
with were trying to hide things. They wanted us to
travel to the north though the eonferenee didn’t plan

W for that as a whole. Most of the

4 students thought it would be very

important to see what was going
on up there.

You can be in Kampala and

feel like nothing is going on. Guys

walk around with big guns but the

city is very safe though a eivil war

is going on.

$822: What were the differ—

ences in women's issues in the ru-
ml areas versus the urban?

CampbellaPatton: In the inner city there are more
resources and special services. Women in the'north
face violence and rape often even the soldiers pro-
testing them will ask for sexual favors.

The government has moved something like 94
percent of the Acholi people from their villages into
temporary camps. The camps are not always safe. In
order to farm, the people have to leave the camp and
therefore farming is dangerous. They would starve
without the World Food program.

In the south, women are more frnaneially inde
pendent. I heard about the Bead for Life project.
Some women were taught how to make beads out of
old magazines and they’ve made earrings and brace-
lets, which they can sellThey’ve been able to develop
a skill and market the skill in the US.

SE53: Describe someone you met at the confer-
ence,

Campbell-Patton: Jeoffrey oryema, Executive
Director of the Acholi Youth Peace and Reconcili:
ation Initiative, works with youth on peace building
and he does trainings with them.

He asks the kids what they think. He works from
the bottom up. He doesn'tjust tell them what should
he done, instead he works with them. It gives them
ownership and encourages them to follow through. It

sounded like it would really work.

SﬁdB: What can students at Grinnell do about
the eonﬂiet in northern Uganda?

Campbell—Patton: 1 think the most important
things that people at Grinnell can do are raise aware
ness about what's happening and encourage people
to come up with solutions at both the grassroots and
government levels.

Two potential avenues for aetion are: one, host
a house party and show’the film Tire Invisible Children
( www.invisiblecliildren.orv),which shows the toll the
war has taken on the children in [northern Uganda];
and two, write a letter to your member of Congress
asking the US. to put pressure on the Ugandan gov»
ernment to manage its resources more effectively and
address the war in the north.

One possibility is that the U.S. can redirect aid

through humanitarian organizations so that _it reach—
es rhe people who need it rather than supporting the
government onganda.
