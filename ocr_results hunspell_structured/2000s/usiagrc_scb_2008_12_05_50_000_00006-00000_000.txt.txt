Two thumbs up for One Acts Festival

.l'W BRIAN Sllmtwm

The One Acts Festival, which begun lilsl
night, offers the best chance this whole some?
tcr to see just how talcnred Gnnacll rh
studcnts archhc entire process ofbringing the
words often different plays ro life begins and
ends with thc efforts ofthcsc performers and
directors, and it all sraited in a direcring class
at rhe beginning of this ycnl.

From the beginning, the class, taught by
Craig Qiintero, theatre, has been focused on
bringlng the vision ofstudcnt directors to life.
assuming they have an experience to share
and the resources to share in “My role as the
faculty member for this class is a faciliraror: I
don’t come in and say, ‘You should do this.This
should be your inrerpretnrion,“ mintero said.

The Festhml includes plays thatrange from
broken relationships and lost loves to grieving
and ghosts. 1t premiered last night at 7 pm. at
the Wall in Bucksbaum with Stage Dimrlianr,
T/M Uniwrml legu/Igl’, and Awkward SZIL’IMI,
all ofwhirh will be performed again on sar-
urday at 2 pm. The next seven plays will pre-
mlere ronight and the whole fesrival will wrap
up Sunday nighr.

Although the performances of each play ‘

will be brief (10 to 30 minutes each). the
journey to the festival was a slow and gradual
process of creative discovery. “The directing
class [was] really structured to provide an open
space for the students to experiment and ex-
plore with pe.-for.na.rcc,"Qainrcro said.

The srudenrs began with some basic di-
recting exercises in performance art and im-
age-based theater. Afrer rhar, rhey moved on
to tackling the play ﬂmw'itml Bel/7m by David

Mamet. For the play, students conceived of

their own ideas for characterization, set design
and performance concept.

At the end ofOctober,wirh a firm footing
on their directorial visions, the students were
allowed ro choose their one acts from plays
written by playwrights like Harold Pinter, Sam
Shepard, and Peter Shaffer. Their eventual
choices help to make the festival as a whole
more compelling because of its diversity.

“I really recommend that people come to as
many productions as they can," maintero said.
"Each night they will be seeing something dif-
ferent, a different vision, and a different real-
ization of that Vision."

Students who go to all of the showings will
see plays as diverse two 170-year—old Mani-

ad to learn Unamuada, the universal language,
in TIM Uniml‘ralLtmglmgc, and a play in which
the characters only speak to each other in stage
directions in Slag: Dirmimxr.

Although some of the plays seem pretty
bizarre on the surface, they deal with familiar
subject matter. For example, Surge Dil'zrlwnl,
despite its experimental premise. is a simple
story about estranged relatives who come back
to their childhood home after going to rhe
grave of their parents.

The srudenrs often picked plays that lined
up with their directorial vision in general. “I
picked mine because it touched the emotional-
ly," said Jaysen wright ’09, director of Tie 1n-

dr'vrdaa/uy afSrmel/mupl, a play about a broken
relationship. “I think directing is a lot about
who you are as a person and the mark you want
to leave on people."

Caitlin Davies ’09 chose Stage Dim/lain
because of its universal appeal “I picked rhc
show because I feel that it really encompasses
the human condition and the way that people
need to relate and connect to each other even
at the most difﬁcult times,” Davies said.

After choosing their plays, the students
held auditions the week after {all break'l'hen,

process began. And, as it four weeks weren’r
enough, the rehearsals were restricted to eight
hours a week.

“It’s cramming a lot into a short period of
time." Qlintem said. “But I think that it helps
them experience What it's like to work in the
professional ﬁeld.”

Both the actors and directors were under
time constraints, and that helped to bring them
together. “The smdcntrdirectors identify with
our lives as they are right now with the work
load." Hayley Rauzi’10,an actress in Wesley

ing in the play a more fulfilling experience."
