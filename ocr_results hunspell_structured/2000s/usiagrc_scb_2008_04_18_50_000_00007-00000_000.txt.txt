Movies “inspired by a true story” this weekend

Charlie Wilson’s
—- ,War (2007) L

Celebrating “805 poli—
tics with Wit and style

Charlie Wilton”: War has all the markings
of a pretentious movie striving too hard for
an Oscar. Biopic ota man whose actions have
ramiﬁcations for our world today. A midsDes
cen‘iber release date.Tom Hanks.

But instead of conforming to these time-
honored conventions, Mike Nichols’s ﬁlm den
ﬁes expectations and offers a satisfying politi-
cal comedysdrama hybrid.

The war referenced in the title is the 1980:
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. And the man
is aTexas senator (Tom Hanks), far fonder of
living the goodslife perks of politics (namely,
women and booze) than actually serving the
people.

That is,until a visit to a refugee camp—and
the encouraoement of a powerful and beauti-
ful socialite fJulia Roberts)—opens his eyes to
the horrors in Central Asia. With the aid of
CIA ofﬁcer Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour
Hoffman), Wilson manipulates his political

contacts to finally accomplish something good
for the world.

What separates Chm-lie Willa/7’: Wm' from
legions of other behindsthesscenes political
movies is its distinctively playful tonc, Writn
ten by West Wingscribe Aaron Sorkin, it could
easily fall into heavyehancled preaching, but
instead thc snappy, witty dialogue and lively
intrigue keep the mood goodsnatured and
fast-paced.

The strong cast and its dynamic chemistry
also help to maintain this vibe, It’s fun to see
Hanks play sleazy after so many years ofdoe
ing the generic nice guy shrick.I don’t care too
much for Roberts. but her part is small enough
that her forced Texas debutante accent doesn’t
upstage the rest of the cast. And Hoffman is
always Hoffman, especially here, where he’s
breaking windows, arguing with anyone and
everyone and rocking a sweet mustache,

The movie loses swam near the end, when
the relatively light-hearted tone suddenly and
awkwardly shifts to something far more serr
ous.The challenge with factsbased films is that
the audience already knows the grand ﬁnale.
In this case, that ending is that the arms and
training with which Wilson helped provide
the defending Afghans wound up in the hands
ofthe men who would become Taliban.

Here's a reality that needs to be acknowl—
edged, but doing so means reconciling a char—
acter we have come to admire with the devass

caring effects of his semi-heroics. so we get a
forced, somber mood in the last five minutes
atter an hour—and—a—halfofreveling in politis
cal intrigue.

All the parts may not jive perfectly, but

when it works, Chm/i2 Wilwn'r War mines
enough fun from the most unexpected sources
to make it worth your while.

Room Draw: A Bizarro Story by Mike Kleine

The air turns sour and my face begins to ﬁzzle. Around
me, the crowd is roaring in revered ecstasy, and all I can
do is mumble incoherently. Volcanoes begin to sprout all
around my face, Momentarily abandoning my hedonistic
beliefs,l take my shoes off and march toward the table of
directors (RLCs), hoping to get the room 1 want. I don't
care what it is, as long as I don't get Cleveland.

When I dream, I dream big. 1 dream about eating cars,
setting are to my fingernails and eating balloons filled
with water. Last year, I roomed with a small heard of rabid
bunnies from Arizona. There were only about a dozen of
them, but they were loudiluckily, my walls were sound-
.roof. Today, I doubt their authenticity, but then again,

long-term reversible birth control.

what about Jesus? I was a Student Advisor—still am. Today it
4/207thinking is the lasr thing I want to do. .

The tooth smells ofbaked tea, and no one else seems to care
but me. I’m the only one farming the air away, and at this rate,
were all going to die. As I’m doing this, the director sitting in
front ofme gives me the weird eyeil immediately stop. Babe
bling about some nonsensical bullshit, I muster my way to the
next one and she also gives me the stinlveyeTo offset it, I spit
in her eyegshe doesn’t seem to mind and instead motions for
me to keep going. Is this some kind of test? The ﬁrst before the
last holds up her hand for me to stop. Stop What? I'm not doing
anything wrong.

“My babbling may seem incoherent right now, burI assure

you, this is my real shoe sizct"I say this as I begin drawing
a line on the table. It's supposed to be a representation of
my shoe size, 11.

My wordsare a jumbled mess, and I doubt she under-
stands me. Regardless, she puts my elbow and reds me to
go. The final one, Maryssa, doesn't look too pleased. She
seems to have soiled herself, and for some reason, it metas
phorically makes sense to lne.

“Gimme a name," was what she said.

“Tender Branson,"was what I replied,

“You have Norris Third, East. Now please make room
for the others,” was what she replied with.

Big room and tiny corridors? I can live with that.
