Gender Neutrality Workshop and investigating SPARC

SPARC needs to be more accountable

If past years were equivalent to 1 wild saturdny night, sun-
day morning’s hungover has come to SPARC in the form of
an economictecession resulting in budget cuts. Unfortunately
for the existing publications funded byg SPARC, the commit~
tee's allotted budget for the year fell by a signiﬁcant amount
from last year, while the number of prospective publications
will likely continue to tire. While each publication has at its
core a valuable concept and fulﬁlls 11 unique
niche, SPARC's lack of effective cost ,
analysis and accountabi11ty has proven
detrimental to the spirit of the orga»
nization

To elaborate on this point, one
need only point to the recently disr
tribured Bread 8R0“: publication To
clarify, the funds for this publication
were allocated by last year’s PSPARC, and we
do not blame the present committee for mistakes' in which it
had no say. Furthermore we consider it laudable and worth
while to have an entire publication devoted to the pretervation
of human rights around the world and would like to see Bread
of Ram published in some form again. But, howetcr poignant
the articles mity be, the fact remains that SPARC likely over—
paid for this glossy-papered, rullecolor publication.

Many of the decisions that factored in to the production of _

Blend careers were made vnthour regard to responsible spendr
ing. For instance, only two ofthe 12 pages in the list-endemic:
had color photos and over a page was used in citations. Consid—
ering the cost of the paper that the Band @Raiz: was printed
on, SPARC should have required stricter guidelines as to how
that type of paper could be used. Ifthere are only going to be
two pages with color photos, is there a need to publish on the
glossy paper at all? And surely the citations could have been
condensed to take up less space, Our cri cism is not limited to

Bram! F5 Rolex, hut extends, to some degree, to all publications
including the SHE. SPARC does not exist to simply put wmd
documents onto expensive paper without reason.

What we suggest SPARC do now is to think very carefully
about creating a budget that works toward reﬁning consistent
publications and guiding and incubuting ﬂedgling publications.
SPARC could do things such as oversee the process of creating
a new publication, providing resources such as layout design
and giving media heads the means to assist one another This

would ensure that every publication that
comes out of SPARC has 11 core that' is
worth more than the money that goﬁ
into it.

The 36575 is :1 prime example ora
publication that has pulled itself up by
its bootstraps over the past few semest
ters'l‘he page layout, amount of con—

tent and overall quality has improved

without any incentive besides a sense of pride
in their hard work and a desire for that to be reﬂected on the
paper itself. SPARC should require other publications that
aren’t as selfsmotivated to be as accountable for their work by
providing a set of standards and rollowing up on their progress
in the stages preceding publication.

There also must be more emphasis on creating 11 pay scale
that makes sense for the amount of work put into a publica-
tion. Basic steps need to be made toward identifying and cut-
ting down on unnecessary expenses so that each publication
can have all the money 1: needs' in the face of budget cuts. Vice—
Chair Katey Gagers 11 plan to have editors log hours ofwork
and scrutinize their wages will hopefully be an effective mea-
sure to track the money spent. SPARC should continue with
measures like these.

For the sake of the publications on campus, SPARC needs
to get their act together, and they need to do it quicldy. Many
successful publications stand to lose a lot because of the blun-

ders ofvery few, Thousands ofdollars that make up the SPARC
budget may make it seem as though 8500 lost here to glossy
paper or there to unwarranted salaries doesn‘t really matter, but
that’s a foolish way to go about business. In the end, difficult
decisions will inevitably be made, but if they are smart deci-
sions, readers ofSPARC publications won't be disappointed.

Success of the Gender Neutrality Workshop

Given the seemingly apathetic nature of Grinncll s stue
dent body—think open forums attended by more cookies than
smdents-last weeks Gender Neutrality Workshop was eye~
opening in more ways than one

The forum, whidi aimed to answer questions and initiate
dialogue about gender neutrality on campus, had over 100 stil-
dent, faculry and staff attendees. The fact that this event was
able to draw together such a large portion of the campus on a
weekday night shows that gender neurrality' is a relevant con—
cern for students and a topic of active discussion.

Thanks to the Stonewall Resource Center, Grinnell AJust
and the Transgender Action Group’s adept organization and
publicity, the workshop drew a wide variety of students, Rather
than preadiing to the social justice choir, the forum readied
students who came with legitimate questions and concerns re-
garding gender neutrality while adding new voices to the dis
cussion and allowing it to move forward,

As Ajust and other social justice groups increase their pres-
ence on campus, students will see more opportunities to ud—
dress potentially sensitive issues as a community If anything,
last week's forum is evidence that students are ready and willing
to have these discussions.

It is still a little early in the year to count out socially-just
eggs before they hatch, but here’s hoping (hilt as workloads in—
crease and stress mounts, he, she arid as will still find time to
come together and continue the discussion of issues central to
our understanding of social justice and of each other.

Coming to appreciate the peaceful prairie of Iowa

one ofthe most startling things I learned
about Iowa after coming here 1s that it con-
rains some oftlie most fertile agricultural land
not only in the United States, but on the en,
tire planet. We often
do not think of soil
as a resource in the
same way we think
of forests or miner-
als or even water as
resources, But Iowa's
most valuable resource, the reason for its set-
tlement by Europeans, is its rich, thick black
topsoil—up to six feet deep 1n some areasThe
ubiquitous presence ofcorn and soybean fields
is a testament to the thorough and sometimes
reckless exploitation ofthat resourceThis soil,
which is the ground under our feet and the
ground of the entire history of this place. is
the direct legacy ofwhatcovcred Iowa just 150
years agoitallegrass prairie.

Another thing that startled me once 1
started to ﬁnd out about prairie is that ifyou
look at a map of its former range across the
middle ofthe country. you will and thar lowa
sits at the heart of it. It's the only state that
was just about completely covered by the range

plucesbased studies at the college is called the
Center for Prairie Studies The name does not
mean that it is only concerned with the study
of prairie, it means
that whenever WI:
are studying this
place, whether we
are directly looking
at the prairie oi not,
it will invariably be a
part of our study of place, Take, for example,
the soil. The soil in Iowa was built over the
last ten thousand years by rail grass prairie as
year after year of accumulated plant material
decomposed and grew layer by layer into feet
of fertile soil. All the agriculture in Iowniand
all that the agriculture in Iowa has contributed
to lift: in this place has been based off the

In the mid 18005, when the ﬁrst European
settlers began to settle and start farming in
Iowa, about 80 percent ofwhat is today lowa
was tallegrass prair' Today less than one
percent of that prairie is left, scattered nctoss
thousands ofremnant prairies that survwetl 1n

sides or in small areas where the soil was not
suitable for plowing. The rest of it has been
plowed up, and most ofit is still being used to
grow the relentless duo of corn and soybeans
that make Iowa famous for its agricultural
productivity

All of this is l1ltely to be information you
have heard or will hear elsewhere during youl
time at Grinnell, 1 hope. i

ofhow important knowing about the prairie
could be.

If you've never seen or visited prairie, or
even if you have been but didn’t take much
notice, find a sizable remnant or reconstructed

cluding the college's own

Wade right out into the
middle of the prairie and
spend some time surround-
ed by it, it doesn’t have to
be a mystical experience. It’s
just noticing how different
it is from any other place,
how much being somewhere can change the
way you are thinking or heighten your aware:
ness. That opportunity for awareness exists
everywhere whether its a native prairie or the
corner ofPatk and 6th. But Ive found that the
prairie, being 1n it and knowing the names of
its plants, has had a special ability to make me
feel connected to this place. I th1nk that's a
possibility it holds for everyone.
