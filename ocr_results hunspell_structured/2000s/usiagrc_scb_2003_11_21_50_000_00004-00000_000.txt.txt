According ro Vicroria Brown, Hisrory professor and member or

pracrical oosracles. “In rheory studenu ihinle [bringing in minoriry

Ar rhe ncxr meering, Montgomery eired

Grinnell has creared two oii.campiis pro-

college is a mcmbcr orihe Coiisoriium for a
sirong Minoriry Presence and rakes two

“The parrieipanrs or [MSIR Program] were inreresred in Grin-

Some professors poinr ro orhcr college resources. “I rhink rhar

For Gibel Azoulay, rhe prolilem is also primarily one oraccounn

“Admissions was rorced to rind a solurion, or answer wirh rheir

The currenr sysrem allows for deparrnienr auronomy in hiring

Schneider, however, disagreed. “1r is imporranr for deparrmenrs ro

are going ro end up."

But oioel Azoulay rhinlrs rhose rradirional prioriries need ro
