Twilight
(2008)

Vampires! Love! Robert Pattinson!

Remember all those Valentine’s days in
high school? You hoped for weeks that some
cutie would slip you a box of conversation
hearts and a smile, but at twilight of the 14th
each year, you found yourself sitting next to
your mom, sharing a carton of Chinese food
and watching a warm, fuzzy love story,

We're in college now, folks, and with ma’
ruriry, warm and fuzzy must give way to the
dark and broody. Say what you will ofits anti-
feminist undertones and trite teenage melo-
drama, any movie that can inspire a room full
of teenage girls and college ladies and gentle-
men to laugh, sigh, and cry (or at least mist)
is worth a view A tweeny masterpiece of pop
culmre, Taillight is everything you could want
in a Valentine’s Day viewing — pining, heroe
ism, frustration and the triumph of love over
common sense.

When withdrawn Bella varn (Kristen
Stewart) moves in with her police captain far
ther in the rainforests of Forks, Washington,
she believes she is fated to live out her high
school days lonely and misunderstood,

But when a lifesthreatening car crash
throws Bella into the superhuman arms of
pale beauty Edward Cullen (Robert Partine
son), life in Forks becomes more than dodge
ing proms. Edward and Bella become more
involved, drawn together by some inexplicable
force (which we tor/d chalk up to puberty uric
der normal circumstances), and Bella uncov»
ers the secret known to each man, woman and
child not in complete social isolation for the
past two years: she has fallen in love with a
vampire.

For Twilight bookworms, the romantic rev
lationship in the film is a bit shallow, but for
the everyday lover of vampire romance, it fits
the genre. Whichever group you belong to, you
can forgive a somewhat humdrum portrayal of
author Stephanie Meyer’s intriguing plotline.
After all, the movie’s simplicity leaves much
more brain space for daydreaming of white
picket fences and sparkling bat babies.

As the hunky lead, Pattinson is more than
mouthwatering. An obvious study in the fine
art of toiling emotion, Pattinson leaves every
viewer wanting more in his portrayal of the
beleaguered bloodsucker. Meanwhile, his fer
male opposite, Stewart, wants for, well, emor
tion of any kind, Apart from the two leads,
Edward’s vampinc family is a delight, demons
strating that casting based solely upon looks
doesn't always go awry

As with the lovers’ relationship, the movie
as a whole moves a bit quickly and condenses
more story than necessary for the overall plot
progression. While we could have done with-
out the various vampire-related deaths (which
were cornplcrely ploreunrelarcd), we can un—
derstand the sense of danger movie-makers
were attempting to portray.

Twilight is a delightful treat for anyone
looking to slip away from the greasy Chinese
food to fill up on angst-ridden teen love. But
be forewarned: it may leave you hungry for
more.

The Philadelphia
Story
( 1940)

A classic Hollywood romance

once upon a time in Hollywood, roman-
tic comedies were crafted with such wit and
charm that they won Academy Awards. In Tin
PIn‘Iatic/pbi'a Story, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart
and Katherine Hepburn elevate a solid screen»
play about second chances and the discovery of
love to wonderfully charming heights.

It’s no coincidence that during the span
of their careers, the three leads racked up 19
Oscar nods and five wins between them—they
are three ofrhe greatest actors ofall time.

The movie is anchored by Hepburn's de-
liciously haughty turn as Tracey Lord, a rich
socialite who will soon marry her second hus-
band, the blandly forgettable George Kittredge
(John Howard). l-Iepburn,who earned one of
her 12 Academy Award nominations for this
film, is a fiercely intelligent and strong actress.
It‘s a pleasure to see her bring that quality into
her portrayal ofrhe misunderstood Tracey.

Tracey is described by many ofthe people
in her life as “a queen”, “a statue", or as “cool
and fine". Really, she's just an individual who
shields her softer, romantic side beneath a
ﬁercely aggresswe exterior, She's been burned
beforwand who can’t relate to that? (Grant
ed, most ofus haven’t been burned by the likes
ofCary Grant) Grant, playing his usual cool
and collected leading man, brings in subtle
shades of wry wit and an even fainter hint of
a wounded heart to humanize his character,

The film asks us how two people can re-

There’s real pain and bitterness in this story,
but the delightful part is there is also real wit

Roxanne
(7987)

Big noses, big laughs

Perhaps the most memorable scene of
Roxanne occurs when Fire Department Chief
C.D. Bales (Steve Martin) finds himself be
ing ridiculed at a bar by some Joe Schmo with
nothing better to do than take shots at our
lovable protagonist.

He calls Bales “Big l‘msc." something
you’ll notice Bales possesses fin v quickly But
instead of going to the stereot , al, excessive
bar fight, the scene becomes a rclebration of
cleverness. Bales asks the man to throw a dart
at the dart board, and whatever number he

hits will be the number of insults Bales will
rattle off that the guy could have used, The
man scores 20, and Bales riﬂes off a slew of
insults—“it must be wonderful to wake up
and smell the coffee in Brazill”—which set the
tone of the film and show Bales as something
of an endearing town outcast. '

Aside from reminding us of Steve Matt
tins remarkable talent (he had stopped doing
standsup by this point), the bar scene also we
poses a critical theme of Roxanne: the triumph
ofwit over muscle and smarts over looks.This
is the basis for the plot, a romantic comedy
chronicling the stalled love life of Roxanne
(Daryl Hannah). She Wants an intelligent,
sensitive man (be, Bales) but can't help bring
attracted by handsome, dumb types like Chris
(Rick Rossovich), a new firefighter working
under Bales.

Roxanne makes it no secret to certain con—
nected members in the small town ofSun Val-
ley that shewanrs to date Chris. Except Chris
has the problem of not being able to talk to
women at all. Literally, he has to run away
and vomit if something sbghtly positive hape
pens. Chris‘s “lack ofgame" leads to the Chief
writing letters as if he were Chris, since he
only wants Roxanne to be happy. even if it‘s
not With him. Consequently, Roxanne falls in
love with a hybrid of the two: Chris's body and
the Chief’s miiitl.With great one-liners and a
strong, if somewhat rare lead performance by
Martin, comedy ensues.

The movie also works for nostalgia, as ac-
tors like Fred Willard, Kevin Nealon and Da-
mon Wayans all excel in their hit parts. But
Martin remains the star, carrying a great roe
mantic comedy with deeper issues than might
catch the eye... or even the nose.
