When thinking of a pleasant college liv-
ing experience, anger is not a word that usually
comes to mind. Yet, when asked to describe
Frisbee house, Maddie HartrAndersen ’10 ref
plied “anger and insanity".

Hannah Sherwood ’09 remarked that,
"We’re all friends," after which she was
quickly and jokingly rebuffed. While this may
seem like roommates ready to ask Jen Krohn
for a room switch, for the 11 friends at 1019
Park St, a collegerowned house occupied by
members of the Ultimate Frisbee team, this
anger is just a playful way of relieving stress.
During the couise of 45 minutes, one person
was pushed ofir of an exercise ball in the [lye
ing room, a bug was placed on one resident by
another, followed by gratuitous screaming, and

several minor shouting matches erupting over

dirty dishes in the sinlt,

l

service project associated with them, the house
members ran the Ultimate Frisbee intramural
league.

Because Frisbee House is (allegorowncd, it
has its own set of unique peculiarities, begin»
ning outside with a wheelchair ramp that takes
nearly the length of a Grinneu dormitory to
ascend two feet. Inside, a homey feel is coun-
terbalanced by fire alarm boxes, a ﬁreplace cov—
ered by a large piece ofplaster and the obliga-
tory restroom cleaning schedule signs.

Being collegerowned has distinct advarr
tages; the college mows the lawn, cleans the
bathrooms and provides ethernet and wireless
internet. On the ﬂip side,“at the beginning of
September, at random times people’s PrCards
just would not work on our doors,"HartrAnr
detsen said.

This hasn’t stopped the residents from

making the house their own.

Tins lll‘igCI’ appears to just /I/ b€ll€v€ m human; (hate Walls are covered with Young’s

be a manifestation of the en-

ergy that abounds among the WW
resudents of Frisbee House,

who come from three differ-

ent class ye. : Hrii'trAndersoni

Hart FordrHodgcs and Hanna Licbl are ’10,
Hannah Sherwood, Jesse Petersoantant and
Adam Kortan represent the class of '09, and
Katie Johnson, Katherine Ingram. lan Lune
detskov, Aden StinebricknerrKauffman and
Ian Young are class of’OS,

“Every day is memorable," said Johnson.
After someone suggested that she only speak
in cliches, she responded,“lt’s too much think’
ing and 1 would nevei say anything."

Much of the fun at Frisbee House hnp'
pens on a spontaneous basis, such as Liebl's
shouting episodes, which residents have begun
to keep as tally marks on a board. “We had to
make a new one every day because it was too
much to count after a while," said Ingram.

While the team itself had
never held a house, in past
years Frisbee captains had often
lived in off-campus houses that
would become the center of the
team, especially for storage.This
caused problems in 2006, when
according to Lunderskov, “The
landlord decided that one cardboard box was
far too much to allow to stay, and we lost all of
the discs for that year.”

The idea to apply for a project house oer
curred to four Frisbee players during a match
of Halo one night. “We started with a nucleus,
then added people," Stinebrickner—Kauffman
saidThe next step was allotting the three sin—
gles and four doubles in the house, with rooms
being ofrered first to uppereiassmen Frisbee
-la ers. Since all -ro’ect houses must have a

open ﬁre.”

life-size iasteiizations (pitilated
images that can be piinted out

Ian Young ’08 to create a poster, a technique

that seine students may iec-

ognize from the poster of Sam
Rebelslsy that hung in the Noyce library at
the beginning of the year). Also on the walls
a whiterboard battle between six humans and
six raptors has erupted

“We went out for a SK run last week and

were posing ifsix humans put in an arena the
size ofa track and had five minutes to pres
pai‘c to fight six raptors. Onee we got back, we
just decided to shaie it, and suddenly for the
next two or three days we kept hearing about
it,” Lunderskov said, Now, the figures sport
moustaches and top hats. Inteiprerations of
the scene and who will win apparently iest on
one's faith in humanity, such as Young's assess-
ment that the raptors would win: “I believe in
humans I hate people."
The residents decided to put
up Fireﬂy-inspired door decora-
tions. “Ours are just a piece of
paper and duct tape, without
their actual name on it," Lune
derskov said.

“Good luck ﬁnding the per
son you want," HarteAndersen
said.

Each ofthe rooms has its own unique
features: one, with a lower ceiling than the rest,
is devoted to the shorter residents of the house.
Hart Andeisen and Sherwood's room has a
VValk’ln closet with stained glass window. “No
other room was going to contain the amount
ofclothes Hannah has, so we gave her the one
with the big closet," said Lunderskov. This
same ioom has access to the ioof, something

all four futon mattresses out there one time,
chilled out and did some homework," Lundet»
skov said.

In other spots, however, space is at a pres
mium; the already small kitchen had its size
reduced further by the shelf needed to hold
everyone's food, and a nearly ﬁill fridge was
described by Lunderskov as "kind ofempty'b

“There’s a lot of pizza," said Liebl, while
Lundetskov claimed that he got most of his
vegetables at the dining hall despite the veg
etarians living at the house.

It goes without saying that the people
who live at Frisbee House are as unique as the
house itself Most residents are science majors,
and three of them even have dual citizenship,
but individual personalities easily show.

“The guys are gamers,” said Lundcrskov.

But Sherwood said, “There’s also a lot of
America’s Next Top Model and other similar
fashion shows,"

Frisbee House even harbors a rivalry
against Debate House that they are not aware
of, revolving around the rivals larger kitchen.
“We were already discussing that we should
annex them before we even moved in. I got on
the email list and was like ‘We’ve got a water
balloon launch and we’re ready to open fire.’"A
snowball fight is also rumored, complete with
one rooftop snow fort per house,

One of the few things that Frisbee House
lacks is an atmosphere to study. With all the
fun, "If anyone wants to get waik done, they
leave,"ingram said.
