First year Claire Williams' Is not a rail; model

A brief look at the life of Claire Williams
would reveal her to he very normal, Wil-
liams is a ﬁrst year swimmer who hails from
Urbana, Ill. She has a full schedule, budding
friendships with her fellow classmates and she
makes her way to swim practice through the
snow every weekday. But ﬁrst impressions can
be deceiving. Born with Proximal femoral for
cal deﬁciency (PFFD), a rare birth defect that
causes a person's hip to be deformed, one of
Claire’s legs wasn't hilly developed at birth.

“When Iwas bornI had a small foot on my
lett side at about the level of my right knee.”
Williams said. “Basically, my left femur didn’t
form so it’s a hall ofhone up in my hip region."

As a newborn, she then had surgery per
formed at Shriners Hospital for Children in
St. Louis,Miss. to remove the malformed limb
and since then shes lived a healthy normal
life. And since then she hasnt let her leg in»
hibit her life In any way. Even early childhood
memories of learning to walk, run and play
weren’t deﬁned by the missing limb.

5Even nowl am sometimes startled when I
walk by a mirror and see myselflimping,"Wile
liams said.

Claire credits her strong family support as
her foundation for an active life.

"My parents have supported me in every

. athletic or physical Lhing that I’ve eried,”Wil—
liams said. "I also ride horses competitively
and occasionally race sailboats with my par-
ents or their friends, and played soccer when I
was much much younger, and never treated me
any different than my younger brother, whose
limbs all function correctly"

It should come as no surprise then that
Williams parents were the' Instigators for Wile
liarns to begin swimming over a decade ago.
Initially, Williams was a little nervous around
water

"My parents put me inswim lessons when
I was little, because I started being afraid_of
bathtubs."Williams admits.

Claire’s parents were avidswimmers and,
after helping Williams get over her fear of
bathtubs, they also encouraged her to swim.
Williams began swimming competitively on
and offstarring at age 10.

In high school, she competed in the 500
freestyle he loo butterﬂy and as a senior, she

ied swimmers isnt always easy for Williams
though

“There are deﬁnitely some days that are
frustrating", she said, “but it’s really about do
it for yourself, and go hard.”

It's when people write her off that Wile
liains get most frustrated though. She breaks
the reactions of people down into two categv
ries “ignoring/acceptance" and “the inspira»
non."

“Occasionally I’ve had swimmers or coach-
esimostly Coachesﬁome'up to me at meets
and tell me thatI inspire them,”Will.iams said.

, “I don't like this because I‘m there to rate just

like they are and I’m doing the same'races that

re. By calling me an inspiration they are

g direct attention to my physical disabil‘

ity and placing me In rhe role ofthe token dis—

ability swimmer, and since I dont identify as

disabled it s rather frustrating to be forced into
that identity by someone else"

Notwithstanding stares, cheers and all,‘
Claire is possibly looking at a larger goal,
namely, the 2012 Paralympic Games in Lon-
don. Claire’s history with this athletic event
trails back to her middle school days At the
age of 14, her disability coach encouraged her
to compete in a meet that she didnt know to
be the Paralymp ic Trials, but she ﬁnished with
the top mark and qualiﬁed for finals In the 400
freestyle.

“I wasn‘t tapered or anything,” Williams
said. “My coach was like you should go to this
really big meet and hey by the way its Trials."

~ Now as the Paralympics come into focus
again, Williams is considering giving it a more
serious go

"1 would like to go to Paralympics, Wil—
liams said. It’s been' In back of mind but not
really concrete goal.-

But she isn’t without ulterior motives.

"My dad told me that if I made it to the
Paralympics, he would pay to have things rare
tooed on me if I wanted them," she said.

For now, she plans to focus on her training
her at Grinnell where she feels she’s having a
great experience.

“Its been really good, I really like the sys-
tem of our [rate of perceived exertionT'Wilr
liams said.

“A lor of different people of different
abilities can swim the same practice and get

placed sixth in her sectionals competing along-

side ablesbodied swimmers. She currently

competes in the zoo butterﬂy here at Grinnell.

This is her ﬁrst year in a new conference

and that means a lot of new eyes and initial

impressions. In a swimsuit, competitors are

quick to judge. However, any notions made on

, deck are quickly scrapped once everyone hits
the water.

“I dont idennfy as being disabled, Wil—

liams said 'When I compete the fact that I

have one leg is not an excuse not to race or go
my hardest. Basically,I don’t think ofmyself as
someone who is disabled even though I only
have one leg.”

Her spirit clearly shows dirough her dedi~
cation. Erin Hurley, Head Coach of Grinnell
Swim team,is one of the individuals who wit-
nessed it most this season.

, “She is extremely talented," Hurley said.
“She is the type of person who doesnt draw
attention to herself looking for .iccommodar

tions."
ther 13 seasons here at Grinnell College,

Erin has never coached any disabled swimr~

mers. Claire Williams and Claire Forrester’lS,
another firstryear, are the first.

“It has been a new experience for me" Erin
said. “It has helped us all become more aware
ofour differences."

With such a large team and so many tal-
ent levels. Williams and Forrester fit right into
the team. But competing among able bode

the same from it. Erin [Hurley] is fantastic
Coachﬁh: is really good about knowing what
level everyone is."

Claire truly represents the success that
one can achieve through resilience in athlete
ics. Claire’s message to anyone else aspiring to
become a great swimmer is simple.

“Just try, just get in the water and try
Chances are it’s going to work,"

Mock Trial Wants to make a statement -

BY EMILY BAJET

At St. Ambrose University In Davenport this weekend, a
Grinnell team will take the court solely focused on victory Ex-
pect the team to dive right in, emotions to be running high,
some tense gameetime decisions and, basically, a life-or—deaLh
situation, at least, depending on the case. However, it's not bas-
ketball in the hotsseat, or swimming on trial, but the Grinnell
Mock Trial team going for the win.

The Mock Trial season is broken into two partsithe ins
vitational, non-competitive fall season and the regnilar spring
season, in which the team attempts to qualify for nationals. Last
fall the team went winless, but co-captain Sam Stragand '10
explains that these losses are hardly cause for concern.

"The fact that we have to deal with defeat before we get
to victory is pretty nice,” Stragand said. Some teams get big
heads pretty quickly because they win things and that s where
we come in and get them eventually”

That confidence comes from a wealth of recent achieve»
ment. For at least the past five years, Grinnell’s Mock Trial
team was extremely successful, progressing from the regional
competition over a pool of 24 competitors to the super regional

competition, and gaining their seat at the national competition,
in which only 48 teams of 600 from around the nation compete
Co captain julia Reese 10 says that the fall season was simply
the result of some pre season strategizing.

“We starred preparing for this In September," Reese said.
“At the beginning we were trying to figure out what basically
our strategy would be, and nowwe’re trying to refine that strat-
egy after we’ve seen the approaches of others teams that we’ve
gone up against."

With the pressure mounting as the first big test draws near,
team members try to keep themselves' In peak condition, even
if that means raising the bar by demanding longer and more
grueling hours of practice than ever before.

“We normally meet once a week, but before hig tourna-
ments, we practiced...every day for a week and a half," Reese
said. "Practices are anywhere from two to three to four hours."

Relying on a strong offense and defense, Mock Trial leans
the depth in its players as its main advantage. Reese and Stran-
gand have both been competing in mock trial for the past eight
years, while the other co-captain Adam Lange ’11 contributes
his nearly 10 years of experience to this well—seasoned team.

“Iowa has the largest junior high mock program in the

nation, and my coach was involved with mock trial since the
beginning about 25 years ago, said Lange, an Iowan native
wellsadjusted to the ups and downs of murder, felonies and
misdemeanors. _

Along with the fullhench ofhighly seasoned players, new-
comers to MockTrial bring a nimble mind and fresh bodies, al-
lowing both the A and B team to scrimmage offof one another
in order to reach their full potential.

“We always have two.teams and they end up being both
very successful," stragand said. “A lot of times they end up
qualifying out of Regionals."

As for team goals for the next competition, Stragand be-
lieves his team capable of shutting out the competition and
making another bid for the national gournament in April.

“1 m conﬁdent, as far as being captain, at delivering at the
highest level," Stragand said. lspeciﬁcally am looking forward
to playing a couple of teams that I think we have a good chance
of beating that are nationally renowned.

Depending upon the outcome of this weekend‘s match, the
team hopes to advance to the Opening Round Championship,
or super Regionals, in St. Paul, Minn. the ﬁrst weekend of
Spring Break. .
