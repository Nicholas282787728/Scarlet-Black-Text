“My workload is proisalriy comparable

Charlorre Hoss ‘04. “lfpcoplc don't see you

Many srudenrs who rake Spanish come
plain abour the amounr or daily work rhe

“seminars are incicascd amounr of

A day in
the life

Xianwen Cao, visiting instructor in Chinese

7:00 am My clock radio begins working, but I can't open my eyes
until 0 an. I get up and stagger along to the bathroom.

7:30 a Shave, wash face and have breakﬁst

7:50 a. . Irun into my classroom to see my Chinese level 3 class
students: ire topic orthe class IS Chinese population, family planning
policy and abortion The students' performance make‘s me very
satisﬁed'

9 Mn. I come back to iny office to check my e- -mail box, answu some

! like the questions they asked, such as, ”What’s the differenc between _

1:15 p.m. I begin my Chinese level 2 class. I teach the students
how to write a letter with different styles in Chinese, and then let
them do a short listening comprehension.
2:30 pm. i come back to my ofﬁce, take a tenrrninute rest, then
correct students’ homework and talk with my colleagues about
what I did in today/5 classes.
4:15 pm. I have Chinese level 4 class, ”Chinese Literature arid
Society.” Tire students have a lot or peculiar questions and the
communication between us makes me very happy, The students
are so eager to learn; 1 ask them to study one lesson, but they
prefer to study two. Well, they are typical Grinnellidns.
7 pm I come back to my apartment and make a meal again (1
know it takes time, but my Chinese stomach likes this kind of
acﬁvity) I ﬁnish the meal and clean the kitchen.
8:15 pan, Eyentually, my entertainment time begins. 1 go back to
my office and turn on the computer to go to a chat room to
communicate with some friends online for a while, and then View
some Favorite websites in Chinese and read news and interesting
articles. Meanwhile, I remember to download some useful articles
that will probably be used as teaching materials in my Chinese
classes later.
10 pm. After coming back home, i take a shower and put my
clothes into the washing machine and turn it on.
10:30 prln. It’s time to call my family in China. This is the most
effective way to divert myselt irom loneliness, especially in these
current days, which are the Chinese New Year holidays.
11 pm. I go to bed, put two pillows against my back and get a
paper to take notes about the day/s classes and the most
impressive things that happened. Ten minutes later! put the paper
dway and take a book to read. This is my favorite time to read and

u the most treasured part of my life

12: 30 a m. I still don't feel sleepy, but I should lie down an the

up to work. H pefully half an hour later, I can fall asléep and have
