Cross- -dressing, kidnapping, yarn- spinning

Some Like it Hot (1959)
tttit

Wacky movie is pure fun

Ludierous cross—dressing, raw sexuality and vi-
cious murder make up the strange winning formula
of Billy Wilder's stunning classic Same Li/tr It Hot.

Joe (Tony Curtis) and his good friend Jerry (Jack
Lemmon) are a pair of musicians trying to get by in
Prohibition-era Chicago when they unwittingly wit-
ness a mob hit. With gangster Spats Columho inter-
ested in seeing them dead, the comic duo hash out
a scheme to join an allswomen’s band en route to a
grg in srrrrny Florida under the guise of Josephine and
Daphne, two girls fresh out of a music consen'atory.

Things become complicated, however, when Joe,
resplendent as Josephine, falls for the band's sensuous
singer and sometime ukulele player sugar Kane Kow
alczyk, played by Marilyn Monroe in her prinre as a
silver screen sex kitten. To win Sugai‘,]oe plays at be»
ing Junior, owner ofShell Oil,and through even more
complicated plot twists, succeeds. In a turn of fate
that could only happen in the movies, the mobsters
from Chicago show up. Joe and jerry have to make a
quick mad cap getaway,bringing the movie to a his
larious close with Joe E. Browu° as Osgood Fielding
Ill, the dirty old man chasing Daphne, delivering the
movie's famous last line.

A combination of stellar performances from the
powerhouse ensemble, as well as sharp writing and
incredible comic timing,join to make this one ofthe
greatest American movies ever produced. Comic gt»
nius that transcends generations is diffrcult to find,
but Some Like I! Hot does that and morc,

my Award for Best Foreign Language Film and based
on a novel by Athol Fugard, Its asomctimes brutal
but essentially hopetiil story ofgradual redemption.

The cinematography is beautiful. The impover-
ishcd South African settings are made vibrant, colors
fill and full oflifc and motion.

Hood has to walk a fine line with his title char—
acter. If he strayed too far into making Tsotsi a warm
and lovable hoodlum, we wouldn’t believe it, and any
redemption would have no credibility. On the othcr
hand, we do have to be able to sympathize with and
root for Tsotsi to some degree.

For the most part, the tilm manages to walk this
line in a way the audience can buy. Tsotsi is indeed a
uasry,violent drug, but the movie, particularly through
the excellent performance by Presley Chweneyagae,
manages to keep reminding us that he is, in fact, hue
man.

‘Tsotsi’ is the South African word for thug. In an
early scene,Tsotsi tcfttscs to diVulgc his name even to
his closest contidantes.

The frlrn is welirpaeed, tellmg rts story rn a very
tight 94 minutes. l-Iood’s direction tells the story
deftly, letting us know plenty about the protagonist
despite the fact that he rarely speaks. There are ii {cw
points, though, when the movie seems to icly on cons
vention—for instance, ant: critical, emotional scene,
otherwise wcllrdonc, features an obvious use of the
old “A gunshot: But not from the gun you thought!"
trick.

Nevertheless, the well-made and sensitive Tia/ti is
well worth the mere hour and a half it asks you to
invest.

When T/u-ee Ci'ﬁ’wlll oft/1 Sui/or debuted at the
Cannes festival in 1983, it was described in festival
advertising as “deliberately unsynopsieableLand

The highly experimental frlrn
rambles along through the medley of nonrseourrur
tales of the old sailor, accompanied by a visual shift
from sepia tone to full color. Logic builds on rilogie,
contradictions contradict themselves until everything
seems to imply something but nothing seems to mean
anything and the viewer is left with a mrnd muddled
from the fogginess of 'Iphotisms that behind its time-
less and mystical yarns. the film attempts to convey.

Its attempts, multirlayered and multirfaceted as
they are, might find very few viewers with enough
patience to sit through its meandering script and the
overactive imagination of its creator to finally work
through to the contents its heart: a 1ch ofstorytclling
and the human condition.

Tbl'er Ci-anvirr (fa Sat/01' is a hrglrly ehalleugurg,
eccentric Work of cinema. At one how and 57 min—
utcse the drcainlikc surrealism of the various sroi-ics
seems to drag at times, but overall, the film succeeds
in pushing the vast boundarres ofinraginarion.
