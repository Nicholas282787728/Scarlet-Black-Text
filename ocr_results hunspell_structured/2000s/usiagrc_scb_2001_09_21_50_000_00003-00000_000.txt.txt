an internet company and the entrepreneurial spirit and risk it required
in the late 1990s. It has received positive reviews from The New York
Times, Entertainment Wekéy, and Salarmpm,

Prashant Parodti ’02, confounder ofGrinnelI Entrepreneurs, who
are co-sponsoring the film along with the SGA Films committee and
the Wilson committee, says the goal ofshowing the ﬁlm in Grinnell
is to make more people aware ofbusinest possibilities and experiences
like Tazman's and Herman’s,

Tom and Kaleil's experience depicts the rise and fall of the Ameri-

“never say die” attitude," says Paroda,

Gtinnell is the only place thatTazman and Herman are appearing
in coriiuiicrion with a screening of the movie, said Doug Cutchins,
Director oFthe Ofﬁce oi’ Social Commitment, Cutchins attended

able to help this special opportunity become available in Grinnell,

East-West plays in Harris on Friday;Startup com plays on Saturday

Brad: Felt like this day would never
come; issue three on the shelves! How
often does a guy get the opportunity to
own something with your name on itt

layn: Well, at least your name can
be found When lwas little, lcould never
ﬁnd pencils or license plates with
my name on them. So Bred,
be glad that your name is easy
to find, unlike layii, for
which there is nothing.

5: Hey, i know
my name, Before we
start with the re
views, i want to
thank Doug

Student Arnirs
for lending ut

curse Family video and Videoland USA
for their bad selections.

the American Dream.

J: This movie is intense. While this
is not one ofthe best movies I have ever
seen, it definitely deserves credit for be»
ing brutally honestabouroneofrhcmost
risky industries, This movie traces the
path of two high school friends, Kalcil
ISaLa Tuzman and Tom Herman, who
had a drcam of starting their own
inrerner company, Their company,
GauWar/zr.min, reached incredible suct
ccss, but ultimately collapsed. At least
they stayed ﬁiendsi

B: Starttipfam, unlike most docu-
mentaries, has great direction, Shot solely
on digital video, there's thoughtfulcam-
em movement, no voul narnrive, and
text showing Just time and location, So
if you prefer boring Ken Burns docu.

mentaries, go watch the sixth tape ofyour

Ctr/i! uni» box set

J: Brad, who the hell is Ken Burns?
lvly only problem with this ﬁlm is the
amount ofuscless details givcn. The the
room is a close friend ofKaleil, so too
much attention is focused on him Also,
there are a lot ofsccncs that have no pun
pose in rolling the story For example.
there it a 15-minute segment ofKaleil's
girlfriend Dora, talking about how she

wants a dog and conﬁrming for every»
one watching that YES! the loves Kaleil.
Who cares? This has absolutely nothing
to do with “the rise and fall ofthenrncri.
an dreami" However, other than a few
superﬂuous moments, this movie is fas—
cinatingand deﬁnitely worth your

time to see.
a: Yeah, overall a well-
crafrcd documentary, lr has
a great soundtrack and

two sweet montages.
Still, Gui/Warkmm is
called a nationally known

srnrrup, yet I’d never

Jayns Closing Thought this movie
is great because it offers such a rare
glimpse at life in Silicon Valley, which

not. For all of you with similar disillu»

Brad’s Final Fact: Torn sounds exactly
