Mike: sometimes I hate you both so much.

Tim: \Vell, I didn't want the poor people to get fat.

Wyatt» Fat poor people? That gives mt: a great idea tor a
Fetish costume!

Mike: Oh, my God. Please tell me you're not going to say
what I think you are.

Tim: Are you suggesting that VVyntt is goina to attend F
tish dressed as a rat poor person, and you don't think that's a
good costume? so you‘re saying that for poor people can't be
attractive? That’s awfully insensitive ofyou, Mike.

Mike: Not only are you twisting my words, bar you hoth

know that Wyatt is thinking of going as a rat poor person just
to be insulting.
’ Tim: Listen, Mike, it’s not meant to he taken seriously. Fat
poor people are like unicorns: they can't really exist. Do you
think poor people have enough money to eat so much they ac-
tually get fat?

Wyatt: And itthey do have money. they spend it on things
like track And moth.

Mike: Touche. But I still think that Wyatt dressing up as a
fat poor person doesn't really fit well with the idea ofFensh.

Wyatt: No Mike, you're misinterpreting the event. Fetish
is the one night ofthe year when all things considered sexually
deviant and taboo arc embraced

Tim: After all, this great country was founded on individual
freedom and the ability ofall citizens to pursue happiness. For
some of us that means amassing fabulous amounts of wealth
and power in order to ﬂaunt it, and for others it means having
sex with fat poor people. Either way, it's not your place to judge
what others want to do, Mike.

just put the excessfood in a bin and let the local
pig farmers pick it up for frac.Thc pigs could eat
the food and we could build good ties with the

Someone is all Mixed up

_ When someone asks for‘scramhled eggs in the
eggs to orderline chats what they should get. In-
stead they are getting eggs that are already most-

1y cooked before the yolk is enacted. And Rs,
cracking the yolk and letting it sit there doesn’t

L do anything. Please crack the eggs and mix them

all together so the scrambled eggs can be yel-
low like they are supposed to be instead of the
splotchy white, yellow and black/brown we get in
the morning. Also, runny eggs: not so hot.
