Ah, the changing of the seasons. For most Grinnell stir
dents, the annual transition from fall to winter brings to mind
thoughts of newly barren trees, biting wind, gossamer snow
ﬂakes gracefully descending
from their celestial realm and
avowedly subsfree ﬁrst years
timidly chugging Hawkeye for
the very ﬁrst time. But for the
three or four Grinnell students
who follow sports that they
don't play, Old Man Winter’s ar-
rival signals the coming of the college basketball season and the
conclusion of college football. It's a change that can't happen
fast enough for the Kansas Jayhawks, whose football season is
currently imploding but whose basketball team is ranked first
in the nation and favored to win the national title. It's the best
of times, it’s the worst of times. It’s a tale of two sports, two
programs that are run very differently by very different coaches
that are each emblematic of how to succeed—or failiin col—
lege athleticsl know that following only a single school risks
boring what few readers remain here at word 184, but please, at

Under the heavy tutelage of Coach Mark Mangino, Kansas
Football has gone from oxymoron to a watermark of national
prominence that many perennial powers haven't reached for de-
cades. In 2007, the Jayhawks went Izri and beat Virginia Tech
in the Orange Bowl—garnering Coach Mangino shared Coach
of the Year honors with Missouri’s Gary Pinkel. Mangino’s

Kansas Jayhawks represent everything
wrong & right with college athletics

subsequent hefty contract extension certainly did earn him a
fat paycheck to help put food on the table,but the 2008 season
left fans hungry Despite returning the oftensivo nucleus ofthe

previous year’s team, the ‘hawlts
only made it to the Insight Bowl,
where they beat Minnesota.
This year, Mangino's very plump
goose might be cooked.

After starting the year in the
Top 25 and reaching as high as
Number 16, rhc Jayhawks have
dropped five in a row, including losses to lowly Colorado
and in-state rival Kansas State. Mangino has even dabbled in
benching three-year starting quarterback Todd Reesing, a one:
time Heisman contender and the face of the program's rccent
success. Their next two games are on the road at Texas, where
they'll be lucky to even put points on the hoard, and at Ar-
rowhead Stadium against the Missouri Tigers, who just took
down the aforementioned KSU Wildcats. If the Jayhawks do
not reach bowl eligibility, it’s no reason to tire Mangino. How—
ever, internal investigations into Mangino‘s conduct, including
issues of player abuse and other angry outbursts that have sure
faced over the years, might provide plenty ofreasons to ﬁre him
and dump his already corpulent list of off~ﬁeld issues. It goes
without saying that football’s culture is largely one ofmasculine
posturing and chauvinisin, but there's a line between “man
1y" roughness and outright abuseilf Mangino crossed it, he
should not stay, regardless of his team's success. Even without

these issues, a 5.7 season would likely send Mangino packing.

As for Kansas basketball, Coach Bill Self's Jayhawks also
know a thing or two about controversy First there was a hub—
bub over possible NCAA violations in the recruitment of2011
NBA Rookie of the Year Xavier Henry and his 38 yearrold
brother—next was the famous series of brawls between the
football and basketball teams in which guard Tyshawn Taylor
injured his hand throwing a punch and lastly was guard Brady
Morningstar's DUl arrest, which resulted in his suspension
for the ﬁrst half of the season. However, Coach Self’s Jay-
hawks have not been subject to the scrutiny and chaos of their
football counterparts for two reasons: self has not been sub—
ject to any serious controversy like Mangino, which keeps the
program stable and projects a front of tranquility, and, more
importantly, they will get it done on the court. Despite a close
call Tuesday night against Memphis, the jayhawks return too
much firepower and have too good a freshman class not to be
considered favorites for the national title. I’m not going to say
they’re a lock for the Final Four, but I would be shocked if
they’re ranked worse than firth all season.

The Jayhawks' programs are different because Bill Selfis
scrupulous, disciplined and handles himself adroitly with the
media, his staffand, most importantly, his players, while Mark
Mangino is angry, potentially abusive and has a face like a
groundhog peeking out above a stack of pancakes. Persona
ality matters a lot in a coach, but as always, winning comes
first. For Self, that axiom equals along career in Lawrence;
for Mangino, perhaps one that is reaching its denouement.

Women’s basketball starts
season on the right foot

BVDARWINMANNING

The Grinnell College Women’s Basketball
team is gearing up for their ﬁrst tournament rhis
season when they play in the Tip-oaToumament
this weekend at Darby Gym. The Pioneer's ﬁrst
game is versus Buena Vista
University at 7 pm. on Fri-
day and then against Martin
Luther College at 3 pm. on
Saturday.

"Buena Vista is a solid
team that is competitive in the
Iowa Conference, they have
a pie-season Alermerican -
on the team. They will be
well coached and tough to
beat," said Head Coach Kate
Gluckman. “Martin Luther has some height in
their roster and some solid rctuming players."

Given the tough competition, Liz Burnett ’13
says that Pioneers' goal this weekend is controlling
the fundamentals.

”We're rcally hoping to accomplish getting the
small things down, like boxing out and rebounding
and setting screens," Burnett said. “We think b
doing the little thingswe can come outwith awi

The key to controlling these “little things"qu
depend on the pace of the game, The Pioneers
want to play methodically building from the back
and controlling the ball and this style will be tested
this weekend,

“The teams that we're playing all have high
pressure defense so we'll deﬁnitely have to calm
things down and take it to our speed of the game,”
Burnett said.

But the Pioneers will have a big advanmge this
weekend in their home court in front ofa supportr
ive crowd and sleeping in their own beds,

“1 am really excited to play at home this week
end because it is always easier to play at home ,.in
your gym Team Captain Jessica Shom '10 said.'
"We know how rht hoops feel and the baskets tend
to be friendlier."

Due to Martin Luther's draining schedule pre-
ceding their game against Grinnell, the Pioneers
expect to have a physical advantage.

“I looked at Martin Luther’s schedule and
they are playing three straight gamcs this week
end [Thursday Friday and Saturday]," Shotts said,

”We gol [he first gameymeri out
now, 50 / think that we Where a
great weekend and can definitely
(lime our JsD after ill/‘5 weekend. "

Forward Jessica Shorts ’1 0

"We're lucky because we face them the last day
which means fatigue might set in for them during
our game.”

The team showed some of their potential early
this year after a comeback win on the road against
Comdl College last Sunday

“The best part about Suns
day's win was diat we came
back lifter being down by sevr
en at halftime to win,"Shotts
said, “We had a pretty rough
ﬁrst half but the second half
we were a completely diﬂcr‘
ent team to watch.”

As the second half began,
the Pioneers went on a 12-2
run to take the lead. Cornell
cried to keep pace with the more cmcient Grinnell,
but by the twtrmlnule mark it was Grinnell that
held the sevcnrpoint lead. The ﬁnal score was so
66, Grinnell victorious.

"I felt like we played With a sense ofconﬁdcncc
and composure, especially when the game was
close,"Gluckman said,

The success in the ﬁrst game would have not
been possible if it weren’t for some Very big perv
fonnances by veteran and new players. Shorts led
the scoring with 17 paints, and Michelle Briggs'13
lead the team with 15 rebounds and four blocks,
while Jessica Vaverka vll, coming off the bench,
scored 10 points with 100 percent shooting.

But as the ﬁrst half demonstrates, the team
is not wrthout their weaknesses. In die ﬁrst half,
Grinnell shot 26,9 percent hour the ﬁeld and made
only one threespointer. But the biggest concern for
the Pioneers was their willingness to give up the
ball.

“we had 26 turnovers in our ﬁrst game. We
need to take care of the ball better, make smarter
decisions and harder passes,"Gluckman said.

However, after a week's worth of practice and
the home court advantage, the Pioneers are conﬁs
dent heading into this weekend.

“We got thc ﬁrst game jitters out now so I
think that we will have a great weekend and can
deﬁnitely come out 370 after this weekend,”Shotts
said

Men’s basketball team
focuses on development,

by MARCUS EAGAN

The Grinnell College Men's Basket-
ball team lost to William Penn University,
133401 Wednesday in oskaloosa, but the
team still gained valuable experience from
the game, The Pioneers were coming offa
tough, comerfrom-behind win at home on
Sunday against Waldorf and were playing
an athletic William Penn team that proved
too much. Although Grinnell was only
down four points at halftime, 62-58, they
were unable to keep up with the Statesman.

“It seemed like, even in that first half,
we were making a lot of mistakes,just With
the execution of our offense,"Team Captain
and point guard Ross Preston '10 said. “So
I think in the second half when those miss
takes continued to occur and they went on
a few of those mns and our shots weren’t
going Inilllcn it just got to be this thing
where this had been building all game and
[the team was] just really frustrated."

In their game against Waldorf, the halves
were flipvflopped. The Pioneers were down
24 points in the first halﬁbut won the game
by seven in the end. The problem apparent
in both games for the Pioneers is that their
offense is just too streaky.

“Well, the first half against Waldorf We
didn't shoot well, it was the first half of the
season, and it was a lot of the freshmens‘
first half playing “The system'so it was a lit
the rough," guard Augustus Karisch '10, said.

But that doesn‘t mean that the team
hasn't been able to score. The Pioneers went
on a 16-2 run in the middle of the second
half against Waldorf to tie and then was
able to pull ahead in the final minutes for
the win.

"I think we've already shown that we can
go on runs,”Preston said. “We definitely can
do it in spurts but we haven’t shown that we
can do it all game"

But the area that the Pioneers are most
concerned wrth is their defense.

“Everything gets starred on defense,"
Karisch said. “lfwe can get a lot ofsteals, if

we can get our hands on some balls, and get
the other team frustrated. Even if we don‘t
get a steal, they're running all the way down
the court, getting a layup, and having to run
all the way back, so they get tired.”

Involving the first years in the scoring
will also be a major factor in the team's sucr
Cess.

“We have three or four Freshmen in pri-
mary scoring roles where they’re expected
to do a lot, and they have a lot of pressure
on them to do well,” Karisch said. “To some
extent, the success of the team does depend
on the freshmen making shots. Even those
who aren’t shooting, being where they need
to be on the ﬂoor and making good passes
will be important."

The Pioneers will get another chance to
improve in all of these areas when they play
Bucna Vista College at 2 pm. tomorrow in
Storm Lake, Iowa.

“They had a great record last year," Presr
ton said. “They didn't make it to the tours
nament but they're good. They're going to
be slightly more disciplined than the two
teams we've played so far. We're expecting
themeto be really physical and beat us up a
little. Being on the road makes it more dif-
ficltlt'than at home, naturally."

As the Pioneers work through their
tough non-conference schedule, they're
hoping to build an identity as a team. If
they can keep their defense consistent and
they can develop their first years then the
team believes they'll be ready for whatever
Midwest conference play will bring,

“It takes some time to get used to the
new style of play and get used to new posit
lions," Karisch said. “It could take a couple
games and it will be ditterent for every
freshman. People will have had four or five
games to acclimate to ‘The System.’We are
playing tough games. If we can get through
the pre-conferencc schedule and have our
confidence intact...We will be ready."
