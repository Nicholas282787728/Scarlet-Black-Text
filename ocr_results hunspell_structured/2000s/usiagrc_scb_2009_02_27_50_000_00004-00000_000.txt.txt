“In general, the Committee’s line has been ita publica-
tion wants to fill a niche that isn't ctiricnrly being served,
that is going to be a gieatei piiority than expansion ofa
current progiam," znnidka said.

Christine h’IcCormIck’O9, SPARC Chail, said It is 635’
icr to budget for the sinallcr publr tions that Come out
once a scntcster because they do not a . for much fundIng.
ziiiudka said these moi-c speciatiecd, niche publications,
such as the 07 (Ill/III]! Eloumiit‘tr, nsnallv cost $1500 to 32000
per semester

“Vi/e had one publ icatIon that thc onlv thIntt lhevwint»
ed was the cost to pIint, McCormick said “Something
like that is reallyjllst land to ctit, bccause its a really good
project we want to fund and ifwe cut anything rom them,
we’ve cut tlIeiI eIItIIe project."

Ross Preston '10, editoi’il‘rcliief of the BEa’S, said his
budget was cut by an insignificant amount and should not
affect the publications overall quality.

“The Bests has a pretty small budget compared to other
publications. All we need is money for salaries and print»
ing cost," Preston said.

PRESS, which publishes student works in book form,
asked for $23,000 this semester—up {tom $20,000 last
semester—hut only received $18,200 PRESS co-editor-
iii-chief Parvoneh Shirgir ’09 said they will have to cut
back on some things, such as not producing a hald~cover
publicatIon, but they will stIll be able to produce most of
what they wanted.

“SPARC was pretty generous with us, they gave us
enough money to continue producing quality student pl‘ojs
ects." Shirgir said.

According to zinudka, thc numbcr of publications has
increased dramatically in rccent ye ifrom c. lit in 2003
to lo this semesterian increase he attributed mostlv to
technological advancements

“I think a lot ofthc gi arcr interest in publications has
to do with the technology in that it’s so much easier to
cic. to something and send it to a printer," zinndka said,
“heroic, you had to set type."

Students said that they appicciare tlic incicase in puhlls
cations, but still wanted funding to bc rcgulatcrl by SPARE
hoards and arcfnlly split amongst piihlicatio -.

“I think tot-using on hauing a low really good [litlhlicar
tions] would piobablu be in eucryonc's best interest but at
the same time it s nice o hate a wide vaiietudepending on
what you like to iead laiiead o Gradi- to said “As long
as the quality' isnt ai ccrcd by the quantity

To solve the ongoing funding problem, zinudka and
McCormick had several suggestions. Besides raising the
student activities fee, Zinudka said some larger publlcns
tions could reduce dayrtorday spending and thc formar
[ion ofa SPARC advertising agent could increase reucnuc
across publications,

“The seal; does a good job [with ads], and some could
be integrated into [publications such as] the CJIt/Imc oi the
Ecatiatviirt,” zrnudka said. “The idea is creating one person
who has contacts and knows the pioccdure to be a clear—
inghousc."

In addition, SPARC is looking for ways to increase
alumni donations in ordcr to create an endowment similar
to thconcs SGA and The De ug Union have. The ens
downicnt would provide cons nt revenue through inter
est. However, zinudlta said “it would be a long time before
any SPARC endowment could he startcd."

from p. 1 city residents by the police.
\Nill Schwaﬂer’09, one of the
student arrested three weeks ago, was picked
up for public Intoxication and inteifering With
offmal aets. He said that he interfered be
cause he was skeptical ofthe intentions of the
Grinncll Police officer talking toagroup ofscr
niors returning to campus after 100 Days.

“I knew the Grinncll [Police Department]
and specifically this officer have a record of
trying to catch Grinnell students with public
intox in the downtown area. So I was just kind
of worried,” Schwaller said. “When we [leave
campus] we’re looked at as different than other
people, 1 think that's unfortunate."

Saida Ayupova ’10 said she felt that per
lice presence on campus has increased since
she first came to Grinnell. “In my ﬁrslsyear it
felt really safe. You know you're not 21 and
you can still have beer and walk across campus
with your beer, you knew the police were never
going to be there,"Aypova said. “But now you
can't do that because you don't know when the
police are going to show up.”

Despite student unease, Jody Matherly
Chief of the GrInnell Police Department said
that the College was not a target for policing
activity and that it was treated the same as the
rest ofthc community,

“The college keeps us busy but it's really
not ovenvhelniing," Mathcrly said. “We don't
have a huge problem with rhc kids there, we
don't have a huge problem with call volume
there The last thing on ouI list is to try and
harass college students.”

Mathetly saId that violatIons related to tilt
cohol comprised the majority of these cums
mitted by Gtinnell students. In comparison
to its peer institutions, Grinncll College has
a moderate number orstudcnt arrests per year
related to alcohol. Under the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus security Policy and
Campus CIimc Statistics Act, all colleges and
universities which participate in the Title IV
federal ﬁnancial aid program are required to
publish annual crImc statistics. According to
the 2007 Clcry reports from seven peer instir
tutions. Grinncll saw roughly 3.2 arrests per
every 1000 students. other schools gener
ally had numbers in the low single digits but
ranged from as low as .54 at Macalester Col-
lege to 20.6 at Amhcrst College,

Some ofthis mistrust might be inevitable,
according to Dean ofStudcnts Travis Greene.

According to Giccne, snidents often will only
inteiact with police officers in negative situar
tions, stIengthening an already present work
nos, “1 think that given any college student on
any college campus. anytImc you are goIng to
see police officers outside oftlic community of
which they're a part, there's going to bc sonic
healthy skepticism about why they are here,
whats their motivation,_[and] what are they
trying to do to me," Greene said.

Administrators and the police said while
they enjoy a good working relationship with
each other, then: is a healthy division of Ian
bot. Briscoe said, for instance, that he is not
informed about police department plans and
Green: said that he is rarely, if cvcr. directly
contacted about any individual offrcampus arr
rest,

Btiscoc said that police officers are always
allowed in the open parts of campus and can,
under certain circumstances, enter residence
halls. According to Briscoc, police typically
enter a dorm for one of three reasons—when
they possess a search waIraut, are actively pur-
suing a suspect, or are respondIng to an emer-
gency such as a fire alarm oi violent act.

While Btiscoe cmphasIzed that the PolIce
Department is the primary law enforcement
agency for the campus and that they work well
with Campus Security. the College’s Security
Ofﬁcers are often meant to act as a liaison hes
tween students and police. “What we try to do
with the rules and regulations is not he in a
position where you’re going to put yourself in
a positIon when: you’re gomg to get aIrested,”
Btiseoe said.

Also acting as a layer between students
and the Gtinncll Police Department Is the
studentrrun ACE Security. “What happens at
Harris is that ACE Security acts as an aide
dItional buffer between the Gtinnell College
student at large and the police," lrlowort said,
“ACE security’s mic is to be active in self-gov-
ernance, being responsible for addressing Slur
ations and commtInIeating concerns about is
sues that undermine community or IIIdIVIdual
rights, whether they be your own or others,"

Howort said that ACE SecurIty wants
to better di eminatc information about the
group and safety and scciirity on campus in
gcncral, In addition to the forums,ACE Secu-
rity has created a plan on the popular cyhei fo-
Ium GriIIneLiPlans that addresses commonly
asked questions.
