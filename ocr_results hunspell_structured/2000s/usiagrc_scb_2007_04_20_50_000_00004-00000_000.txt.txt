In the winter of 1999, Jesse MeClellantl '01 and Garret
Shelton’Ol submitted a 22tund for Excellence” proposal to Fres-
itlent OsgoodTliis proposal was a retprest for 320,000 to buy
a PA s ~tem, drirm set, L vboiittl and some other equipment to
create a strident organi, tion for student bands. Osgood apt
proved the proposal, and Freesound, a group to promote sttlt
tlent music, was born.

sormtl could be doing a lot more on campus s it once dltl.

“Freesound probably used to be one the coolest orgaruxr
trons on campus," said David Barnett .08, member of the now
di, sscmhlctt campus band The Hong Kong lilondes, There
have been no campus band shows this year. and there were few
last yc- n. This year were definitely had a lower profile,” said
F ric Rtrhn 08, the leader of Freesound for the last two \lears

Freesounds lack of remit) is tlue,‘ in part, to the luck of

practice . cc on campus. In previous ye ~s,harrds were allowed
to pr-act , in Music House, which has since been replaced by
other themed houses like International Gourmet Home and
Dag House, Now, rhc only public practice space on campus is
in Norris l’lnll basement, which has lesrthan—optrmal acoustics
and poor equipment, Rohu has the only key to tlus practice
space, and some musicians said it is not easy to get into contact
with him.

In its first years, Freesound organized campus band shows.

Basically for halfoffall semester and all ofspring semester

most busted equipment vouve ever seen in your life," Barnett
said. It you contact hrrn [Rohn] to borrow the kev [to the Nor

Rohn said that there is a difference between his and
Chavez’s styles, who is now currently the le1der of the Punks, a
band who came to Grinnell on l\l2r3 9 01 last 3/e1r “The differ

Because of the poor equipment and practice space issues,
many bands have become frustrrted 1nd some have broken
up, including Barnetts bantl.2 Halfway through lastyetrt, Free»
sountl meetings b rsrc .rlly stopped. campus band shows slowly
dwindled down and theie havent been ari3 this year, said Mae
Polianka 08, who lived in Music House last year. “Fae ound

Other feel that the little actnrty of Freesound has wealt-
encd camprrs music Without 12‘ o'unct connecting musicians
to each other, rndivid il mus I is are not able to form bands
and hands lire not able to organize live rows. “if the major
mu. us on campus more iiwa), then tlrcr io than to start
new bands," said Polianka.

Rohn sees the decline of Freesound as a responsc to thc
1bsenee ofbands on campus rather than the other way around.
“A lot ofrt [the decline of Freesoundjl ras to do with the lack
of bands on campus, he said ‘People have graduated, people
are abroad," One banti racing these problems is vegetable
Mcdlcy, composed of Chris Knap ’08, Robin Cultcr ’08, Mark
D'Agostino and JefTVViner which has two ofits member's cur
rently abroad.

Musicians such as Polianka said that the music cornmui '
has many obstacles to overcome. Practice space needs to be imr
proved, equipment needs to be updated and a stronger commit-
nity needs to be formed, Brit these problems must be addressed
simultaneously. “Having a practice space on campus is more
important than hawng Freesound operational," said Polranka.
“But they need to go together "

Some students are trying to bring Freesound back to what
they believe it once was Emilylwtrc 08 former coordinator for

soon about u , t vea and getting Freesound to bl: rcalh active

group and it gar tons ofﬁrnding'

Rohn supports this outside° help, especially if people think

The disparity, according to Susan stratn

unequal distribution of resources between the
two programs, Strauber, who teaches an his-

Despite the apparent problems in having
a single department to cover both studro art

relationship between the two programs has
been generally positive. “I don't know anything
about the funding, or anything that goes into
that."he said. “But as far as art history profes-
sors interacting with art studio students and
stuff, it’s been really good.“
