Grinnell is known for us nbillry to produce
gmdlmre srudenrs rind nonrisrs. So it's nor a sur-
prise rhnr rhis yenr's oornrnsnoemenr speaker
will be Professor Judith Burlcr, who combines
both roles in her wolk as n thcons: and proper
nem ofquecr pollries.

“She’s someone who’s been able to be ill-
rensolyrnrellecrunl nnd rlreorer'rerrl but to reru
very rooted in rho r-enl world oipollrlcs,"srrd Jar

”She's rhe ﬁrst Womnn in my gcncmdon
that's been ubl: to dominnre the thcorcrical
