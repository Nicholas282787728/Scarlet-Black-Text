Alternate war
opinions

Dear Sir or Mzdamr

Reporrer Mike Andersen's arriele on rhe AntieWzr Movemenr in
and around Grinnell College menrioned rhar rhose who supporred a
war wirh Iraq were a small minoriry on rhe eampus and rhar, hy
and large. rhose harhoring sueh heliefs preferred ro keep rhem ro
rhemselves for fear of being exposed so eririeism or worse. This :iru»
arion is appalling, and we sineerely hope rhar ir is nor true. We, as
well as several orhers, communieared our “prewar" srarire ro Mr.
Andersen while he was preparing rhe arricle, hur very lirrle informa—
rion was puhlished eoneermng our views in whar was orherwise a
wellswnucn and lengrhy reporr.

Perhaps rhen rhe rune has come re share wirh rhe campus com»
muniry rhar rhere are ar leasr a few who are commirred re rhe ”pro.
war" prineiple ofregimc change in Iraq, and perhaps orher places as
well. Ifwe press forward wirhourarrieularing a posirion. we riskdrowri.
ing in rhe ryranny of rhe majorlry. This is, afrer all, a demeerarie
soeiery, and no one should Tear ro air rheir views.

Are rhere rhose among rhe “and-war" movemenr (we refuse rhc
rerminelogy ofwar) who helieve diar rhe Iraqi governmenr. led by
Saddam Hussein, is a iusr governmenrz Is ir a governmenr ofihe Iraqi
people, by ihe Iraqi people, and for rhe Iraqi people? Oh ye, Mr.
Husseins governmenr puhlished rhe unanimous resqu ofrheir mesr
reeenr eleerion. where he and his parry were she only choice on rhe
hallor. hur do we helieve this? Yes, rhe henevolenr Iraqi governmenr
freed all ofrhe prisoners from irs .ails except rhe polirieal prisons
ers, Bur ler's ner mind rhem. Are we re overlook rhe faer rhar rhe Iraqi
people did rake ro rhe srreers in opposirion ro his rule in 1991. while
we srood hy, and Mr, Hussein eriermrnaiexrhem toil/7 Janina/willp-
am? We “watcrnus” were appalled hy rhe Taliban in Afghanisran:
dieir rrearmenr of women, erhnie minoriries. religious minoriries,
rheir sponsorship of rerrorism, and rheir arehaie and hruraI “jusriee"
sysrem. The Iraqi regime headed lay Mr. Hussein is lirrle differcnr,
He may nor lop offhands in sorrer fields, hur he has employed chcmi.
cal weapons, rorrure, and lerhal force ro repress polirieal dissenr in
rhe pasr. He flaunrs inrernarional rrcaries, he defied rhe weapons in-
speerion reams, and he srands ﬁrm in his supporr of rerrorism. We
sreod by, and cenrinue ro srand by, and ler dais happen. We perpetus
are asysrem ofsaneiions rharsuarves rhe Iraqi people while Mr. Hussein
owns a deaen presidenrial palaees and rehuilds his milirary.

Yes. many of rho prohlems in Iraq are of our own doing, We
ereared Saddam, and we ignored rhe growing ride ofhasied we are so
poignanrly aware of roday. Whar should our response be? To ler eur
misrakes persisr. and grow. and build so sueh a hiry rhar we cxpcn»
enee a repear ofrthwinToweis attacks? or should we go ro work ro
repair our misrakes. reaffirming our heliefrhar, asThomas Friedman
has said, “rhe furure eari hury rhe pasr",> We Amerieans may have a
had repurarion in rhe developing world, hur ro ehange rhar we need

Deposing a despor and ensuring rhar a arahle and demoerarie ruler

shadowed issue is rhar our mosr fundamenral eivil liherries are heing
eroded. Anorher is rhar rhe poliey of preemprion (nor neeesarily

Honesty over

To rhe Ediror.

Hello, my name is Jim Dinnerville. I graduared in 2001, wirh
perhaps rhe lowesr GPA in Grinncll hisrory, so don’t rake whar I'm
ahour re say roe seriously Anyway, I was iusr reading your reeenr
news arriele on ‘SchGovcmancc.’ Aeeording ro your sourees, is is in
demise. Well. I remember rhar, ahour rliree years ago, I ran for die
oiriee ofscA Viee Presidenr under rhe slogan “Sulfscovcmancc is
Conseienee." Everyone hared rhar slogan. I heard ihar awell.rerpeered
(ic. feared) proiessor of polirieal seienee as rhe school rook a few
momenu ro rake rhe rhing aparr in elass, poinring our, logically, rhar,
sinee ‘eoriseienee' is a eulrurally imposed deal, no single ‘sclf’ eould
aerually have an indiviial one, or ar leasr rranslarc ir inro a pelirieal
sysrem. I also heard, over and over again. from vereran people in rhe
adminisrrarien, ahour how ‘Sclf-Govnrnancc.’ as ir was designed in
rhe [9705, had everyrhing ro do wirh responaihiIiry wirhin, and ms
wards. rherommuniry, and had norhing re do wirh, asa person quored
in your arriele said, “governing your self.”

Well, mayhe I’m demensrraring why I earned rhar lew GPA ar
Grinncll, hur, im’r someones arrirude rewards rheir eommuniry firsr
based on rhcir arrirude rewards rhemsclves, or or leasr orheis on an
individual hasis.> Isn’I rhar ‘liulc veiee’. or, I should say, ihar eulruially

imposed inhihiior known as eoiiseienee ihe rhing rhar keeps us 1101\-
esr when no one is looking, and no one is around> Anyway, and I'm
sorry re he longwindcd ahour rhis, hur ir seems ro inc rhar rhe usual

main issue, rhar is, perry erime is on a use on campus and a rise of
perry erime on campus will, ulrimarely, iesiilr in ‘seligovernanre’
heing diseredircd hy rhe aurhenries rhar exisr,

Why am I wriring rhis.> one monrh ago I was rehhed ar gun»

rhe pisrol was pressed ro my forehead, I really did rhink ahour whar I
had done in life no joke. I hadspenr rlic lasryear running a group
rhar was opposed ro plaeing a urine hoar in my area. so I had dealr
wnh ‘nrgnni'ation' rypes hefere. hur, I have ro say, rhis was inhnircly

rrying ro say heie is rhisHIon'r rcducc moral and eommuniry issues

Do nor hlame rhe ‘adminisri-arioii's’ poliey, er rhe phanroin conserva.

I was :xtrcmely disappoinred io read rhar less rhan 50 person of

Fire and foremosr, we should vore ro honor ihe srruggle ofrhose

Women led by Elizaherh Cady Sranron and Susan B, Anrhony
endured yaais ofdiseriininarion in paving rhe way for larcrsuffragisrs
re gain rhe righr ro vore forwomen. Sranron and Anrhony's pioneers
ing work ramc ro fruirion when women, led by Iowa’s own Carrie
Chapman Carr, sceured rhe passage oirhe l9rh ainendmenr in 1919,
finally gaining for women rho righr ro vore.

Duiing rhe civil righrs movemenrs of rhe 19605, young Amerie
eans ourage ,oiiied vorer regisrrarien drives in rhe Sourh ro assure rhe
righr ro vore for African Arnerieans. Many African Americans risked
rheir livcs siniply hy enrering rhe polling place. Michael schwerner,
Andy Goodman, and James Cheney were rhree ineinhers orrhe cone
grass of Raeial Equaliry who were muidered for rheir ariempis ro
assure rhe riglir ro vore for African Americans in Mississippi

These people gave rheir lives so rhar all Unired srares cirizens
would have rhe riglir ro vere, yer over halfofour eaiupiu is eirhrr roo
lazy or aparherie ro leave our privileged posirions ar an eliie liheial

sccondly, rhough you may nor feel rhar any eandidare represenrs

rliar you do nor value rhar righr. And anyone who does nor value rhe

Wake up. Grinnellians. How ran our college he proud ofirs so
