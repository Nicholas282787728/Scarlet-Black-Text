It isn’t everyday that you get [0 meet the fur
rure back- -up saxophonisr for Dave Nlal‘lhwvs

nese monsteruithusth, Sandwich ur hand, his
hair neatly tucked baclg he begins to tell me the
lmtli."ljust said that as a ioke acnrally,"Rogowsld
revealed. “Sce,1 agnecl ir was plausible enough
that people would believe it."Aiid ihcy drd.

lr’s only behmaibll: because Rogowski is one
ofthe seven memhels of Slaughterhouse 6, a ska
band ﬁom Des Mo‘incs, lomi, Born in Denver,
Colo, Rogowski soil calls Des Moines home
and admirs that rr is a uurch smaller ciry but
with considerably less clinic. “Vl/e’ve never actur
ally been Slaughterhouse o," Rogonski explained
between sandwich bites “At
one porur, we had 11 morn
hers but now we're down to
eight I guess die smallest
we’ve ever had was seven."
Slaughrerhpuse 6 was an .
idea concepnralized our of
Rogowski's Japanese class,
who's always been ﬁlscrnated by rhe language as
well as the culture.

“Godzilla, mosr people don'r know, is a worns
an," Rogowskr said. “My reading class in sixth
grade, we got ro read the endrc scripr of Godzilla
from front to back." This is where Rogoivskls
infatuation wirh Japanese orlarre begins to show.
“I've actually been lhere rwice already," Rogowski
added. erh rwo u-rps under his hclr, Rogowskr's
posr-gmduarion plans include a return rolapau in
order to teach English classes and then attending
grarhrare school for a degree in Japanese, “If rhar
doesn't work out, I'd like to Stan a small tccolcling
srudro rn Dos Molnasr—an opuon he can only
further develop wrrh his music degree.

Rogowski discovered Gi‘lnncll due lo its
plmmmty From his home and rhar his dad's besr
Friend \er a big advocate for Grililiell. “He said,
iryou're going ro go ro school in Iowa you might

"More so rhan ihaul really like the eruiroruneur,

Despite his somewhat “chill" attitude,
Rogoivskl asserted that he is, in fact, an asshole,

would only make room for more pokenplaying

is not ready ro pay back 533,000 worrh ofloans
every nronrh for ilre next ren years.

Amidst his mavagance, there lies a secret,
somedaing mosr people don'r know abour him. “I
was arrested,"hesaid.lwant ro know more barre
snain myself, arr-aid it might be a iouchysuhjeer so
instead,l go bad; ro talking abourwhar he knows
best: music. As a music major, Rogowski has tcr
spccr for all genres drough his least favorite is ops
era. “1 meanrl respecr opera and I had lo srudyrhc
hell our of ir in Music Hrsrory," hogowski said,
“but rhar mighrbe parr oflhe reason why [I dour
like rrJ." Rogewsld’s favorite genre, in eonrraer, is
“mello\v~ass"'music.

For some reason, i feel disappointed though I
was actually expecting the given answer i usually
read rhe S631? ire iells me. E'We ll usually have one
or rwo issues around die aparuncnr sol like ro leai

feet on the outcome ofhis proﬁle and he nods in
agreemcnr,uirh a slighr smirkl quickly jot down
a few notes and ask about somedung nonnnusic

All rluoughour his high school career,
Rogowski regularly attended AllsSnrce speech
evenrs and was also big on acring as well as ini»
prov, lr wasnr undl rhis semesrer that he dedded
ro pur some oftliosc skills re use. “I just decided to
volunteer for [Prison plays] dais year,” Rogowski
said. "My roommare's gulfciend is rhe one doing
the playwrieing piogram.They know 1 like to air
so rlacy asked me ro do u."

I realized rhar a lor ofthe questions I've asked
haven'r acrually come flom my preanauged list,
1 asked a radar generic quesnon to throw hun
oiiLir's abour his earliesr childhood memory.
Unsurprisingly, his answer turns into a rarhcr u
usual srory. liell down rwo lhgl us ofsmlts rn mv
