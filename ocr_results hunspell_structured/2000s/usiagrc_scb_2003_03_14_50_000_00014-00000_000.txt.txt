Stupid people stink a lot

Could everyone making posters and flyers please
make standard a small (8 point) rightsindented footer
with "up" and "down” dates? UP 03/08 DOWN 03/
28, for example, implies that the poster should be
taken down on March 28‘ Doing this will not use up
much space on the paper, but it will prevent confu-
sion about posters which say merely announce some—
thing like "BREAD-BAKING WORKSHOP TODAY," and
also make it easier for the custodians to take them
down at the right time Moreover, campus groups
with recurring events would not have to print new
posters every week.

Too much stress, too much time

How many of the runners for the recently concluded
SGA elections will go around campus removing their
campaign posters?
