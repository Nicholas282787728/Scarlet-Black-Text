Sri Lanka safe

I would like to express my disrtpr
pointmcnt with the misrepresentation
of the situation in Sri Lanka as port
rrayed by the we,

I would begin by contesting the
term “civil wai," employed no less than
three times over the caulse of the at-
ticlc Although the present situation
technically meets
the qualifications of
a civil Warinamcly,
a conﬂict between
political {actions
within a countiy—
as Chris noted, “it
is gcnctally seen .is
a fight among ext
tremist groups on both sides, with the
majority of the Sri Lankan people be
ing caught in the middle." Further, the
situation is never teimed a civil war by
Sn Lankaii citizens; rather, jouinalists
prefer to use ethnic crisis or ethnic con-
ﬂict, terms which in and of themselves
are somewhat misleading.

I would also point out that contrary
to the beliefs of the 382?, the country
otsri Lanka continues to enjoya cease-

lhe situation lS never termed (1 NW
war by Xn‘ lair/(ail citizens; rather,
puma/r55 prefer to use ethnic
t/eansrng or eliinit arriflitl.

rirc agrccmcnt and that sincc August,
the conﬂict within the country has in
fact tleereascd. as opposed to intensis
lied, as the article suggests,

As ioi the travel advisory, i would
clarify that it does not apply to the is-
land as awliolc,but iathei to the north-
ern and eastern provinccs exclusively, It

is no surprise that
the ISLE program
has continued to
run undei such eons
ditions, as the pro-
giain has operated
continuously since
its conception in
1982, with but one
exception at the height of the conﬂict,

As my cousin Aaron, who studied
abroad in Israel, has been known to say,
statistically speaking, it is much more
likely that you will be shot in Chicago
than in Sri Lanka.

In conclusion, I would ask that
the we please refrain from publislis
ing such sensationalism in the future.
Thankyou,

Are we sure we’re having fun yet?

VVl'mt would we do at Grinnell if we didn't have
any work.> we might spend our nights drunk, our
mornings nursing hangovers and our afternoons
passing wraithlike from one end ofthe campus to the
other, waiting for night again. We spend what little
free time we have like this already I wonder ifwe were
given more free time, why would we bother other
wise?

This caricature of
the typical Grinncllian
wasting her free time in
a spiritually empty and
beer-soaked farce is only
a caricature, of course. It
would be wrong to mis-
take what the “typical"
Grinncllian does with
what actual, individual Grinnellians do. And individ
ual Gtinnellians do the wonderful, weird things we
would expect them to do—things that don't neces
sarily rely on the ritualistic over-consumption of air
cohol.

But these activities are by their very nature made
invisible. We do them in the comfortable privacy of
our small circles of close friends, No matter the force
ofout private creativity, we still find our public {000’

other unrealistic caricature. but Grinncllians tend to
spend most of their weeknights either studying, pars

activity or else complaining about how much they
have left to do.

We don’t have a lot oftimejust to sit around and
talk about nothing, and ifwc did happcn to had our
selves on some couch somewhere, we might just start
talking about how stressed out we were about woik so
we would have something familiar to talk about.

is drinking really the best thing we Grinncllians,
with all our ingenuity and intelligence, have found to
do in the two days a week wc have when we can con-

Nobody graduates Grinnell with what amounts to a
dcgrec in bccr. some or us do get concentrations in
beer, howcver. And don't mistake me for a horribly
repressed Grinnellianiparties can certainly be run.

The problem is that it seems like the only thing
we can do as a general campus aetiVity is drink, or (on
our more creative holidays) dress in dmg and drink. or
watch home-made movies and yell at each other and
drink, Grinnellians, ifgiven the chance, seem to want

were only scliwastcd.

I agree drinking can bi: funr Alcohol might be
the great social lubricant, but when we're drunk we
tend to act inconsiderate and loud and not he the best
conversationalists on earth. Which of course are fun
things to be,but not every single time we get to hang
out together, surely.

I think that we drink, not because drinking is a
lot of fun, but bccause we don’t know what else to do
with oiirselvcs.The whole drinking culture (I say this
as a possibly jaded senior) strikes me now as blindly
repetitive.

Oil (hC weekends we face the same constellation
ofovertfamiliar parties with the same taccs and con-
Versations and bad beer. Only the people we want to
hookup with change from week to week, Maybc ifwe
got just a little bit more drank it would finally, just
this once, become inteiestiiig.

1 think we'd probably bc a lot happier ifwe drank
less. Maybe we're just too tired by the end ofthc week
to ﬁnd anything else to do, But 1 don't know about
yeumand maybe I'm just a prudeibut id like it ifI
could spend some of my weekends with people who
weren't my four close friends and we could talk about
nothing (and not our work), get to know each other
and not be so drunk that we eitliei forget or iegrct the
whole experience rlic next morning. Maybe that'd be
fun for i change.
