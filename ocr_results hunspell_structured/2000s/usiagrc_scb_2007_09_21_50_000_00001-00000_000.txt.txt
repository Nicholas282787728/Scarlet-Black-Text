SPARC reform
approved

New constitution provides greater
oversight, transparency and efficiency

BY CHRIS NEUEERT

When heads of publications arrived on campus this year,
they found that the Student Publications and Radio Com,
mittee (SPARC) had essentially disappeared. With no other
mechanism for support, the media heads themselves began the
process ofreforming the committee and writing a new consti-
tution. This week. the administration approved a new constitu-
tion and elections have been scheduled next week for two new
positions designed to more effectively help both new and old
publications than under the previous organization,

The old SPARC had an
elected fiverperson commitr
tee with no titles, as well as a
business manager and assis-

rant. Problems with SPARC
first became apparent at the
end of last year, when the
committee failed to replace
rormer business manager
Eric Omwegti ’08 and to.-
mcr assistant business man-

ager Megan Gotring '08.

“At the end of last year, we

essentially did not have a
business manager, did not elect a committee for this year and
did not have an assistant business manager,” said Nick Blen—
cowc '08, a former committee member who helped draft the
new constitutiont“Esscntinl.ly that killed SPARC."

But concerns about SPARC go back much further thanjust
this year. Dean for Student LifeJen Krohn said that despite ate
tempt to keep in contact with SPARC, the committee was gent
erally nonrcsponsive. "I've been available to SPARC for years."
she said, “and had very few conversations with them."

Media heads have also had problems communicating with
SPARC. "Meetings were closed and infrequent, media heads
didn't know what was going on there was a lack of help and
st lack of accountability," said KDIC director Daniel Furuta.
Furuta felt that the committee was unable to address the emer
gency needs of the publications and could not support new
publications.

For Blencowe, who was invited by the media heads to par-
ticipate in reforms, these problems necessitated the develop-
ment ofan entirely new constitution. "We knew it was time to
make a new SPARC," he said.

“We needed to put an uncomplicated structure in place."
Krohn added,“and have people make commitments to SPARC
so it can serve publications and radio etrectively.“

The new constitution establishes three separate branches
who will control the decision-making process—the elected
Chair and Vice Chair, an appointed board and the media heads.
The board. which will be made up Oh treasurer, assistant trea-
surer and five additional board members. will allocate funding
and approve new student publications. Media heads can check
certain board decisions by a tworthirds vote.

For Abby Rapoport ’08, coreditorrinrchieeror the stair, the
new constitution will again allow SPARC to work closely and
effectively with student publications. “It acknowledges the in-
extricablc link between campus media and SPARC,” she said.
"Previously there has been this barrier when actually they're
mutually reliant,"

This year’s election will be held nextThursday, Sept. Z7,with
a forum to explain changes to SPARC being held this Sunday
at 7 p.m., and a candidate’s forum on Wednesday. Krohn added
that she remains hopeful that the new constitution will lead to a
better and more effective SPARC. “The students now involved
have grappled with the issues and they've done a good job,” she
said."It's just going to be run much bettet.”

Last spring, the newly elected SGA executives set to work
trying to winnow through a large field of applicants to pick a
new cabinet. Due to the number of applicants, and the choic-
es made, the finalized cabinet was met with some questions
from some mcmbcrs ofcampus. "They [concerns] were there
under the surface, but nobody wanted to come out and risk
them," said Vice President of Student Affairs Jan Koszewski
’08. “This fall, I don’t think there’s been a lot of questions
about it.”

Traditionally, few have known much about the SGA cabit
not appointments process, and while questions have subsided,
the process itsclfrcmains largely unknown.

SGA cabinet appointments are ultimately made at the

ion explained

discretion of the SGA executives. The executives are permit-
ted to choose anyone, with no restrictions other than that their
choices must be approved by tworthirds ofJoint Board.

SGA President Megan Goenng ’08 said that applicants
went through a two-stage process. First, they submitted written
applications explaining their qualiﬁcations, goals and talents.
Applicants were asked to apply for only one position, but to ad
dress in their statements of intent any other positions that they
would be interested in filling.

After receiving appl ons. Goering and the SGA Vice
Presidents Eric Olson '08 and Koszcwski scored the applica-
tions numerically on a rubric, and asked the higherrscoring ap»
plicants to come in for an interview.

Applications were not namerblind, because Goering said
that descriptions of qualifications would have given away the
identities of most applicants anyway.

Gocring said that for an applicant to be given an interview,
the application had to be not merely “competent" but “excep-
