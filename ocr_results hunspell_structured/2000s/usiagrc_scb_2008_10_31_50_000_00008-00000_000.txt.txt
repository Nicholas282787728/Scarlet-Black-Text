While musicals kc Chi/dull ajEdell oi Duo [/16 Want/r are
challenging t that achieve cvcn greater power through their
music, sometimes .i theatergoerjust wants to have fun.

Those first nvo plays were put on by GIMP (Grinnell lnr
dependent Musical Productions) last year, and this scmcster’s
GIMP play, Erlml in Lear, which will show tonight and Saturs
day in Sebring-Lcwis Hull, acknowledges the other side ofmur
sical theatre. Director Anna Werner ’09, said that she “wanted
to do something that was fun and upbeat." With chcery, perky
music and a phenomenal group of actors who do great British
accents, Ernest in Love is certainly an uplifting and joyous ex-
perience filled with loads oflaughtcr.

A musical adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s play T17: {viper/mire
ngcing centre, the play was first performed Off Broadway in
the 19605,

For a play about the upper class, you might be surprised
that Enter: in Lem: opens up in the marketplace with the comr
mercial classes. As you hear from grocers and tailors about how
much the debt the upper class has acquired, however, you realr
ize that the play has an element of light satire, which provides
many chuckles and belly laughs but never overwhelms.

After the marketplace, the play shifts to the upper class
hope of Ernest Worthing, the play‘s protagonist, and immedi—
ately we get a taste of his character. “He's sincerely in love with
Gwendolen (the other main character in the play),” said David
Damtoft '12, the actor playing Ernest, “but at the same time
he's sincerely in love with being a member of the upper class."
Although he loves Gwendolen, who’s also a member of the up—
per class, he doesn’t know how to propose to her,

Ernest's love interestV Gwendolen, is nearly as sincere
and simple. “I think I try to act really stuck up most of the
time," Kathleen Murphy-Geiss ’11, the actress playing Gwcnr
dolen, said, “and act as dumb as I possibly can to get the laughs."
In one scene, Gwendolen agonizes over which hat she should
wear “to win the heart ofsomeone with a proper noble title,"

The last main character is Algernon, Ernest's best friend,
who only hilariously complicates matters. “Algernon is the kind
of guy who’s rotten,” Luke Saunders '11, the actor playing Alr
gcmon, said, “but he’s got a soft, nuggety, gushy interior."

The play continues as Gwendolen arrives and Ernest pro»
poses to her. However, after the proposal Gwendolen’s mother,
Lady Braeknell, interrogates Ernest about his age, income, and
birth. She ﬁnds out that Ernest does not know who his parents
are, and that he claims to have been adopted after being found
in a handbag at a railway station. Consequently Lady Bracknell
won’t let Ernest marry Gwendolcn until he finds out the identi»

The rest of the play follows the plot twists, mostly for the
sake of comedy, that ensue. Are the characters who they really
say they are? Will Ernest marry Gwendolen? ls Ernest of noble
birth? With each question come fresh comedic moments and
plot twists that propel the play to a surprising but happy and

ing.

Even though the play is set in 19th century Victorian Era
England, Grinnell students will find that their everyday lives
may not be so different from the characters in the play. “There's
[also] a lot ofawkwardness in the play,"werner’o9, said,“which
I think Grinnellians can relate to.

Weird art engages both mind and body

Kat York ’09 boldly explores some uncomfortable topics and emerges impressed with modern art’s diversity

“Weird... wait.,.this is for an art project?
What?"

This was a sentence I grew used to hearing
as I walkcd around campus asking strangers to
kiss plates of agar for a project that I was do-
ing for Bio as the New Medium, a short course
taught by Visiting Professor and Artist Marta
de Menezes.

My project involved taking pictures of
students' lips, then mounting agar plates that
the students kissed on top of their pictures af»
ter letting whatever bacteria was on their lips
grow for three days in an incubator.

While by no means groundbreaking, my
project elicited enough “ewws” and “whats!" to
get me thinking about how fal one can go in
the name ofart What's “weird,"ltnd why does
it matter?

I started with female artists Diane Borsnto
and Marina Abramovié.

An art student friend from home first told
me about Borsnto. She's a Canadian artist who
works in performance, intervention, video, in—
stallation and photography.

One of her pieces seemed particularly
germane to this week’s colttmn. It’s called
“Touching 1000 People," and it's exactly what
it sounds like it is.

For a month, Enrsuto went out ofhcr way
“to bump, rub past, tap, [and] touch" stlangr
are on the street, the idea being that she was
exploring |hc “smallest possible gesture that
could create an effect in puhllcr" Shc pcr'r
formed this project in Montreal in 2000 ilnd

again in Vancouver in 2003.

As someone who Cringcs at most every
accidental touch, this art project/social eXs
periment seemed incredibly interesting. In the
name of art— not science, not psychology, not
anything else but art— Borsato went out and
interacted with strangers in a way that under
any other set of circumstances might not be
socially acceptable.

Similarly, artrst Marina Abramovic’ also
creates situations in her art that enable and
encourage behavior that is either unseen or at
least under the radar in “real"l‘rfc.

I first heard of Marina Abramovrc' at
WACKL an exhibit I saw in Los Angeles
about art and
the feminist
revolution.

Ablamovic‘
is best known
for a project
she did wher
in she laid
72 nhjcctsi
knives, pens, a
gun with a single hullct, (36.7 on a table in
a gallery space and invited people to conic in
and alter her body any way they saw fit for six
hours

lrightcningly, but predictably, an “aggro
sive" mood took over the gallery. Abtnmoi
remarried totally passive for six hours wh
participants Cut her clothing and jabbed rose
thorns into her stomach.

Both of these artists' works, however,
seemed a little bit distant from our collegiate
art culture here at Grinnell. And I wanted to
finish this column with something that hits a
little bit closer to home.

At a loss for Whntior whomito write
about,l turned to my dear friend and rooms
mate Dayna Hamnnn ’09, asking about “weird”
or controversial art that she’d encountered as
an Art History major.

Dayna told me about a woman named Ala
izn Shvarts who caused an uproar with a piece
she came up with for an show at Yale Univer-
sity last April.

Shvarts had a proposal for her senior art
project that
called what
Yale Nrwr
dubbed‘iiothr
iug short of
iI national
controversy,"
Her project
involved self-
inscminating

then performing self-induced miscarriages us-
ing various abortif ients,

. After nine months. she proposed to wrap
the menstrual blood from her miscarriages
into layers of plastic sheeting coated with
Vaseline to prevent the blood from drying
The plastic sheeting was to he formed into a
cube onto which she would project tooragc of
her miscarriages.

“The piece, in its textual and sculptural
forms," she wrote in an oped defending her

idea, “is meant to call into question the re—
lationship between form and function as they
converge on the body."

Yale would not let her show the piece and
it did indeed spark nationwide dialogue about
how it was to be interpreted and it remains
nebulous as to whether she actually performed
the Sle’lnSemlnal’lOl‘lS and miscarriages or
not.

According to the Hufrmgton Post, the idea
of the project, the press conference, indced ev-
ery step of Shvnrts' actions werc performance
art, or “creative ﬁction" meant to draw public
attention to the relationship between form and
function in the human body.

Whether Shvarts actually went through
with this activity is, in this column at least,
irrelevant. The controversy that she stirred
up and the frightening, potentially harmful
activities that she underwent or proposed to
undergo arc nfmorc importance.

Art, it seems, doesn't adhere to the socis
etnl norms that we do and the moment one
brings the body, or in Borsato’s case, the bod-
ies of others, into that sphere, the black white,
wrong/right, good/bid divide is no more.

It’s art, so it’s OK but it’s a body.. hu-
man being, so it’s not OKThis stufficully just
blows my mind.

Hence the art crush.
