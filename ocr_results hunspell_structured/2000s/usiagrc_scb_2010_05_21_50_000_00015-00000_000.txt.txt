Molly Ridoout '10 likes writing, dancing,
and sex. Well, studying them at least.

“I think there was one semester where every
single one or my classes m5 about sat in some
way or another. I ms either writing about sex or
reading about it all of the time.”

As an English major and gender, womeris
and sexuality studies concentrator, Rideout com—
bines sex and writing,
and dances in her spare
time, She is now an in-
SEYUCIOX for the Grinnell
College Swing Society,
although fiiends from
home would never have
predicted it.

“Back in high sdaool
lms terriﬁed of dancing, I wouldn't even sway
to music in public and now I’m teaching swing
and it's an addiction," Ridcout said. “I travel all
over the Midwest to go to exchanges and dance
wim other people. it's kind ofa eulr. It’s become
a serious partofme now thatI never would have
imagined I would have done, before college.”

Her friends might have predicted her other
main activity at Grinnell, Lhoughﬂiling. In
her four years here, she's conrribured to every
major publication on campuserhe Grinnell
Review, Gnnneil Magazine, Exit 182 and Ins
and Outs, where she is now the senior editor.
Rideout also wrote for the 8&3 her ﬁrst year

at Grinnell.

"It was kind of a comical, making fun of
things, rantrtype column. I wrote one column
rhnr was basically complaining about the author
that wrote Emgan and how unfair it was that
he could get published-the only reason he got
published was because his parents were publish-
ers," Rideout said.

That particular article
gor her into a class on chil»
dren’s fantasy htemture
thar she had just been cut
from.

“The professor sent
me an e—mail being like,
“1 read your article, it was
very convincing, you’re in!"
Rideour is currentlywriting a children's book
for her Mentored Advanced Project (MAP).
Working with Phoebe Zhang'10,a political sc‘r
ence major, Ridcour is intertwining the stories
of two girls, one living on the Mississippi river
and one living on the Yangtze River in China.

“It started with an internship that I had over
the summer," Ridcout said. “I got thrown into
this project called Rivers and Bridges that was
crying to connect the us. and China through
mter ...'Ihey wanted me to do a documentary,
and I was like, ‘I don't do documentaries, I’ll
write a kid's book"

Rideout has also completed three other

internships, ediiing manuscripts for a litemry
agent and working at University ofWisconsin's
publishing press. Her internship in London,
part of her Grinnellein-London study abroad
program, particularly stood out.

“I interned at a ﬁlm/literary agency and i
made an ass ormyseltday one by insulting ‘Twi—
light," Rideout said.

It turned out that her boss’ husband was
working for the company that was running the
international distribution of the ﬁlm. Still, Ride-
out stands strong on her dislike of the Twilight
phenomenon.

“It's awful I read the ﬁrst one, mostly be
cause I needed to know whatl was hacin
like a comma explosion," Rideout said.

I've enjoyed and come to love is loving hating
Twiligbt."

A detestation of Twiligbt is just one ofmany
sentiments that Ridcout shares with a lot of
other Grinnellians. It is this similarity and {as
miliarity that Rideeut counts as the greatest as-
pect ofGrinnell, for her.

“Ar Grinnelll can really express myselﬁl
can go to Halloween dressed as Hester Prynne
from 77,: San/:2 Le/zer wiLh a giant W on my
chest, and people will get the joke. one guy
yelled ‘slut!' and ir was just hilarious," Rideout
said/‘1 can be somewhere where people will un-
derstand my jokes."
