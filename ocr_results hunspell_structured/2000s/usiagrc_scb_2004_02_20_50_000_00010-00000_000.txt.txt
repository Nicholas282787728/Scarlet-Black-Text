Grinnellians have never heen pielry ahour rheir Chinese food,
hur rhey've also never had a ehoiee. Never, in ehe {our years rhar
I've heen sr Grinnell. would 1 imagine thinking "Whar Chinese
Resrauranr do I wanr ro go ro tonight?” But now rhar rhere actuv
any n a ehoiee, and a lirrle downrown eemperirion, I wanred no
see how rhe rvvo resmuranrs measured up ro eaeh orher.

lryou wanr re sluffyour faee, ear all rhe egg rolls you possihly
ean, resise sharing, and ﬁnish your meal wirh a lirrle frozen y0e
gurr, China sea is she plaee far you. But.
if you wanr aimesphere, a erowd, and
even slighrly modern looking deeor, l
dennirely reeommend rhe newesr aer in
rown, Chuong Garden. while rhe restau-
rants horh speeialize in a eerrain kind of
Midwesr Chinese food svirhour mo mueh
spiee, eaeh resrauranr has irs own niehe.

I eompared rhe vegerarian and
szeehwan rare or rhe resrauranrs, rrying
the Szcchwnn spiey vegerahles and rhe
Tofu wirh vegerahles ar Chuong Garden,
and rhe Bean curd wirh Szechwan sauee
ar China sea. 1 was surprised re rind rhar rhe Szeehwan ar China
sea was actually mueh rosrier. There were glimpses orginger and
orher identlﬁablc spiees in rheir saure, while horh dishes or Chuong
Garden tasted ahour rhe same, despire rhe raer rhar one had an
‘indiesies her and spiey' pepper image next in ii: on rhe menu.

Our oflll: 146 ehoiees on rhe menu, my friends earing wirh
me as Chuong Garden ordered rhe Mano Tofu, General Tso
Chielren, and rho Park La Mein, and enjoyed all ofrhcm.

The custard-like MaPo Torn had a similar sauee re rhe Toni
wirh vegerahles, hue had a spiee rhar onen overwhelmed rhe orher
llavors ofthc sauee. Wirhour any suhrlery in navor. arrer a while
n was dimeulr ro resre anyrhing else. All of rho dishes had roe
mueh sauee, overpowering rhe vegerahles or rnear undernearh,
and making ir dimeulr for anyone ro elean rheir plares,

Though China sea has a menu, rhe majonry or customers
order from rhe hurrer, Bur the hurrer has lirrle re error for vcgcmre
lens, The lack orvegemrian seleerion makes rlie hurier rarely worrh
rhe money unless all you wanr are noodles and egg rolls, For all
rhe non<vcgculians our mere—mere are a rewl think~thc food
ar China Sea is nor rnueh dichmnt from rhar ar Chunng Garden.

There is something to be said
for seniority, however, and
it’s important to support the
restaurant that pioneered

Chinese cuisine in Grinnell.

But, when ordering, rhere is a sllght dinerenee in prioe. China See
also has quite an cxremivc menu, wirh approximarely 157 irems ro
ehoose from. Many ofrhc dishes, such as rhe ‘Happy Family; and
even rhe House or Chers sperials, are rhe same ar horh resrauranrs.
Bur ar China sea thc food is eiren just a lirrle hir eheeper, The My
erarian seleerions are a full dollar less. for eiemple.

where Chuong Garden really does ger rhe upper hand is in
regards re anahianee and deeor There a.e whire or lighr green
fabric rahle elorhs on all ofthc rahles, glossy upholsiery deeorared
wirh Chinese eharaerers on rhe eliairs and hoorh henehes. and
even meral silverware on rhe rahles. The ehairs are niee use, wirh
