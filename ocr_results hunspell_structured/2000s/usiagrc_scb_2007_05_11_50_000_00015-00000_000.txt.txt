Campus is diffeient from four years ago,
when Renata Sancken arrived as a firsteyear.
The old Darby Gyni has been replaced with a
neuei version, Cowles dining hall completes
its transformation next semester as apart-
inentestyle housing. And, of course, there‘s
the Joe Rosenfield Center. Perhaps less ob»
scrvabie, though, is how the satirical campus
newspaper mews has evolved from an up-
start publication to something of an institue

said, Sdnckcnm History/English double ma

has been EditoreineCliief since her second
year,

Since that time, no Bests has developed
a loyal readership that eagerly awaits the
next bimonthly lnsmUmcnt. "It's been really
interesting to watch it evolve into a kind of
campus institution," Sancken said. “I don't
want to give it too much credit or anything
but there he definitely people who tend to be
surprised that it's a pretty recent publication
on cainpus.

She credits its popularity to its unique
viewpoint, written both by and for Grinnel-
hans and addressing the issues that most not
inediately a them. “I guess people who
do rcdd it like it because it's mostly insider

Grinncll humor," Sancken said. “Also," she

added, further acknowledging how 7/» RES
addresses the needs of its college audience,
“it’s free!”

work with the Peace Corps

Her prognim is Rural Community Dee
velopment, which includes language teaching
and helping farmers and artisans earn more
money for their products. The goals of the
program, though, encompass more than just
making a concrete difference in a particular
cominuni . “A big part ofany Peace Corps
placement is cultural exchange and just being
a representative ofAmerican culture,"sancke
en sold, She looks forward to “learning a lot
about [Latin American culture] and then
coming back to America and beluga more
wellroundod person.”

Saneken, who has studied Spanish and
traveled to Mexico and Costa Rica, explained
why she requested a Latin Americaebased
placement. “1 really enjoyed my limited expe-
[lEnCES in Limn America," she said. “The cult
rure is very interesting to me and to bo able to
spend two years plus in another part ofLatin
America is ex ting."

While i is difficult to imagine two place
es more disparate than Grinnell and Latin
America, sancken believes her experience
here as prepared her well for her future.

She said that both of list major ﬁelds,
History and English “toqull: empathy, or at

with the characters," She also emphasized
that working in both English and History has
sharpened her ability to think critically and
andytically,

in the Peace Corps and beyond, those lesr
sons in empathy and thinking will scrve her
well, As she said, these lasting reminders of
her Grinnell experience are “deﬁnitely some-
thing that is productive to have in the Peace
corps and just our in the world."
