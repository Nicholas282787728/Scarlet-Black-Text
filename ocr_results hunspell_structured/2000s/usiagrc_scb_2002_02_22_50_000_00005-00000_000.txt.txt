Campus groups look at
moving to Meats Cottage
after Admissions moves

to the Welcome Center

As the Welcome Center nenis completion, Viulc
out campus institutions may be gearing up For a
struggle over space in a noivlycvacatcd Meats cot.
page next roll, The impending destruction or the
Younker Memorial Resource Center will send
Health Servlees and the Stonewall Resource Cen-
ter to ids-yet unknown locations, and Grinucll’s
omce or communication and Events may be
added to this shufﬂe, though 1233 Park SL is not
slated for remoml. And while a numberofamdemie
departments have been murmuring for additional
space, their competition may occur in reverse—
with each department hoping that another will
dccamp across the Forum Beach.

All these plans remain in relatively earlyspecu-
lative stages. Health Center head Karen Cochran
hadn’t discussed the Issue with her boss, Viee Presie
dent For Student ServicesTom Cindy. until the 5&8
published a news brief on the topie last week. John
stone or the faculty's Instructional support Come
mittee has just quucstcd a ﬂoor plan for Meatsa

Before departing for a trustee meeting that
would taekle many related questions, President
Russell Osgood said he would probably organize a
planning committee to consult interested groups
and eventually recommend who and where anyc
one would move,

Cochnn said that both Meats and 1233 Park
had been suggested to her as possible locations for
Health Services. “I want aeeessibillty For the stu-
dents and I would like it to be handicapcaccessed,"
she said. “And enough room that we could have
somc privacy when we examine the students and
when we test for HIV. "

Osgood echoed Cochrans desires for convec
nience and privacy in a new inﬁrmary. I think the
Health Services should be somewhere on central
mmpus." he said, “stoncCo will probably move
with the Health Center.”

Sabrina Ross ’04, StoneCo's leader, has simi-
Iarly limited knowledge about her group's destinn.
tion, “I know that possibilities they’ve considered
include the third floor of mean college and the for
turn," she said. “Although Mcars is a bit distant for
north campus. it might be preferable to the forum
in terms chin and being less public."

Meanwhile. faculty membeis have been exam»
ining their own options for space. stone, a lecturer
in computer science, invoked the longespeculated
possibility or relocating the current bookstore,

“There are a lot or faculty members that are
having difﬁculties with their omens and have sort
orbeen soiiectcd into unsatisractory spaces.” he said.
“The Instructional Support Committee is trying
to sort of synthesIze their reeommendations about
the bookstore area In particular...r We’ve talked
incidentally about Meats... we haven't talked to
any administrators yet."

The faculq' is far from consensus, stone added,
among either departments or committees. “Some
people regard Mcnrs as a kind oi ouirofrlhtkwny
place, *’ he explained,

The English department, for example. has or.
riccs scattered across campus and would like a ceil-
tralired meeting place. but probably not ut the cosi
orbcing separated {mm the buildings in which they
tench. The compute. science department is growc
iug rapidly, but thoroughly tied to the science
building's MathLAN network.

Though all decisions on movement will finally
be made by Osgood, the president stressed that he
wouldn't rush to any judgment.

“I sure would want to Ialk to a lot ofdllrerent
people,” he said.

Dining budget released

Pressure from students pushes Dick Williams to detail his expenditures

Recently, halfway through the academic year and artcr
much curiosity on the part orstudents, Dining Services

decided to relene their yearly budget to the public.

Director of Dining services Dick Williams said the
budget was released at the urging of the Dining Services

committee, a group composed otstudent Volunteers
representatives riom several departments
around campus that meets twice a
month.

“The committee. nnd rnysclr as
president have bceii lob ying [Williams]
roi budget figures," said SGA President
Paul Ford ‘02. “AﬁEt awhile, it became
clear that rhe resistance was above his
level"

Some studeno requested to see the
Dining services budget at the beginning
of the school year. At that time, Will»

rams said he thought an “exact lineclteni budget" was be-

ing requested.

“I didn't wnnt to get into a situation where people
side the business were evaluating speciﬁc expcnditu
Williams said. “[However.] there’s no reason to deny

dents access to general knowledge [about the htldgetl."

Thus, the declsion was made to release a broad 5
mary orthe budget which divides expenditures into

egories such as food, overhead, starrwages, student mges,
staitsalories, and fringe beneﬁts, providing both petcelltr
ages and precise dollar amounts ror each category Will.

ncrois, dieatre faculty, andaudicnce members, One
student, responding to the SEPC’s survey, praised
the “brilliant technical vision ofthe show." Others
relr, in Mease's words, that the “otitsited produce
tion values, tawdry exploitation, insipid chnteogc
raphy, and the ethically obscene use orthc gas chain»
bets at Auschwitz" hurt the show’s artistic integ-
my,

A number oraetors were particularly upset by
the final scene. “1 had a problem with how he pre.
sented that to us." said Haile. “Because he really
presented that as a nocchoice, you’re-in-hell kind
orthing.”

When cast members first rehearsed the death
scene, Haile said,
“[Maharaﬂ didn't say any-
thing. so we just kept
matching and kept match»
ing and eventually people
got really into it and some
people started crying. One
girl almost fell. Another girl
started to hyperventilntc,
she was crying so bad."

HDerlrL agreed, “One
person actually, the ﬁrst
time we did it, was almost
smothered.” Actors didn't
know ifthey had a right to
obyect, “All orus were cone
fused," Haile said. “All of us were unsure No one
dared to break out or the circle because they were
afraid that [Maharay] would say something."

Not all the aclols weie uncomfortable with the
pressure the show exerted on their sense orprupric
ety, however. Williams said that although some of
the scenes made her unmmfonablc at ﬁrst, she felt
like she beneﬁted from pushing Ihosc boundaries.
“1 did it, and I’m glad I did it," the said. “I learned
a lor about mysclr .. what I want riom lire, from
school and eareet, and I Feel llkc I got a lot out of
the experience." -

Rhoads was originally cast in Cabaret but hit
the cast late during the rehearsal process. He later
provided the sec with a bricrstatcment saying, “I
dropped out or Cabaret because I riled charges
against the director under the Grinnell policy or
sexual misconduct.“ Rhoads declined any further
comment.

Maharaj did not respond to attempts to con-
tact him.

‘There was no honest communica-
tion’

For the most part, actors problems with the
show stayed buried until after it ended. Haile ic—
called asking at the critique,

trouble,

“There was no honest
communication going on
during the process," Gordon
said Apart from a few minor
concerns, “the students did
not come as a representativc
body to either the faculty outside the department
or the {our faculty members within the produc»
tion."

The cast deputy, theoretically the actors' iepic.
scntative to the director. was not used, If the {at}

Mary Nelson ‘02 pointed aui, may have been the

Many students said they didn't know irihe pres.
surcs they felt were unusual, and so weren't sure it
they could complain. As one cast member wrote in
an email, “The nnivcte orthe cast perhaps nIImlch

us to such a degree that many or us discovered wc
were covered in biuises without the accompanying
memory of having been struck—we probably
landed the blows ourselves."

‘We’re not hearing enough of the
positive‘

Gordon expressed disappointment about the
negativity associated with Cabaﬂlaﬁet the ptoduv
tion ended. “We‘re hearing the negative. fair
enough," she said, “but we‘re not hearing enough
or the positive, of lives changed or students who
came and who went away with real auctions and
real poignant thoughts about what they not expe-
ricuccd. on that level this production was very
successful"

In a interstatcment, Gordon wrote that “many
students have every reason to celebrate rheirwork
on the production, yet in the hallways of the ﬁne
arts building they have been silenced and shamed
by the minority, i am deeply troubled by the few
students who place their own needs. their own ego,
and their own insecurity above all else without any
consideration orthcir peers."

ricnecon Cab/rm. however, Inost cast members felt
pcirectly comfortable expressing pride in the work
they had done. Haile, though she ob] ectcd to things
that happened during the rehearsal process. said

it was .iii immensely moving experience for me,
and i grew so much because orthis show.

Nelson described her experience as “a lot or

experience."

concerned the guest director, the Theatre SEPC is
