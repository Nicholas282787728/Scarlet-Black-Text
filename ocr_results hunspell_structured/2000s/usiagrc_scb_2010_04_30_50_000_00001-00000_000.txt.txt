Selah to celebrate Grinnell community

Party boasts fund raising ”red shorts run,” petting zoo, live music, pig roast, inflatables

BYMATT BACHTELL

To honor the transition from President
Russell l<. Osgood to Raynard Kington, the
campus and wider community are invited to
come to Selah. a day of festivities starting at 10
am. on Mac Field on Saturday and lasting as
late as midnight,

Selah is a Hebrew word with an ambiglous
definition that is often used to indicate a Link
between two things, either in music or some
other form. The event was the idea of Nord
Brue ’67, the former Chair of the Board of
Trustees, who approached Ose
good. Planning has been going
on for the past two months.

“There was n large meet-
ing with students, faculty and
staff, back in February, where
we decided we just wanted to
plan some big fun event that
everyone in the Grinnell Cole
lcgc community was invited
to" said John Burrows ’10, “So,
l've had some experience plan-
ning events in the past, and so formed a stir
dent committee that’s been working closely
with Meg Jones Bair in Alumni Relations to
get everything hammered out.”

The committee is comprised ofn group of
seniors not afﬁliated with any particular group.
The goal was to create events that could keep it
familyt and community oriented.

"Alumni are coming to this, Trustees are
coming to this, Grinnell College families are
coming to this. so. you know, parents and sibr
lings might be coming to this," said Andrew
Stephenson '10, a member of the committee.
“The College wanted to open it up to the
community as a whole."

Selah will start on a small scale Friday ever
ning with a scholarship reception and a private
dinner honoring Osgood and his tenure at
Grinnell. At 10 am. Saturday morning there
will be a 5K Red Short Run fundraiser, named
for Osgood's
inrarnous jog—
ging attire.
The run is
open to come

proceeds will
go to charity.
A registration
form is uVaJl’
able online,
and can be turned in up until the beginning
of the run.

Next, there will be a public community
event in JRC 101 starting at 11:30 a.m.,which

ing will be a picnic and carnival on Mac Field
from 12 to 5 pm. The Dining Hall will be
closed for lunch so staff members can attend
the festivities. At 9 p.m., the Grinnell Chamr
her of commerce is sponsoring a beer garden
and the Chicagcrbased cover band Maggie
Speaks will perform an outdoor concert.

“There are really four purposes of the
event," said Director of Donor Relations Meg
Jones Bair. "one is tallcing about the fourth re-
building ofthe college. The second purpose is
to celebrate campus together, that we’re all part
of this community. The third is to celebrate
achievement. The fourth is to honor President
Osgood."

Without factoring the money saved by
closing the Dining Hall for lunch, the event
will cost an estimated $100,000, money that
is budgeted by the College towards events of
this kind to foster our community’s sense of
ambition, adventure and wellebeing, according
to Bait. Additional funds were put towards the
event when Osgood announced his retirement
in April 2009.

“We know this is a time that budgets are
tight, hiring is tight, raises might not happen,
so we have been conservative in the best way
we can in how we spend the money for this
event."Bair said.

Burrows is cxpecting a success.

“Bouncy castles.l Petting zoo!" Burrows
said,“Try to not have fun at a petting zoo!"

Grinnell, IA

On-campus
voting for
primaries

BYARMANDO MoNTnR‘o

Unlike the commotion during last fall’s
generals elections, satellite voting for Iowa pri-
maries might not garner the enthusiasm and
hype.

Voters Will have an opportunity to nomir
nate candidates for Iowa state elections in the
primaries on Tuesday from 8 am to A p.m.

“Primaries are different because they're
about inner party politics," said Elisabeth
Rennick‘ll, a co—leader of the Grinnell Cole
lege Campus Democrats, “You’re not electing
someone to represent you, but you're electing
someone to potentially represent you,"

The state primaries allow voters registered
in Iowa to nominate candidates to run in the
2010 midterm elections in the fall. Registered
Democrats can vote for Roxanne Conlin,Tom
Flegen. or Bob Krause to run against Repuolr
can Chuck Grassle)r for the Senate.

The Iowa senator race is the only contested
race that registered dcmocrats can vote in. Re-
publicans can vote for 15 different candidates
in four diacrcnt elections including governor,
House of Representatives, secretary of state,
and treasury.

President of Grinnell College Young Ree
publicans Francisco Reveriano ’13 thinks that
Republican turnout in this election is impor-
tant.

“My only hope is that students vote in the
primaries,” Reverlano said. “They can choose
candidates that discuss issues that affect us in
the future." ~

In the elections last fall, there were 1,056
absentee votes for Obama and 115 for John
McCain, according to Poweshiwek County
Auditor and Commissioner of Elections, Di-
ana Dawley. Many of the Ohama votes were
from Grinnell students since (Satellite votes
are counted as absentee), according to Dawa
ley, who expects fewer students to vote in this
primary,

Rennick remains optimistic about Tues-
day’s turnout.

“I don't know. it could go either way," she
said about the number of student voters. “The
important part is to give students the opportu-
nity to participate in politics."
