‘Action sports’ 90 too far with name change

Seven years ago, when 1 was our a ﬂedgling reoorrer in a high
school heginnrng yournaiisra eiass. one orrhe ﬁrst rulcsl learned
was ro be wary oradjeerivos. Adieenves were okay
when rhaywara used ro physiorlly doerihesome.
rhing or someone, bur when rhey were used
exrranoously, rhoy erossad rho iournalisrie line,

For insranee, in a promo on me. rr would
be okay ro refer ro mysrlrwrrh words like
“blonds." calling myself “hand.
some, dashing, eharmingand ex-
eepnonal" would he going roo or,
1r would also be libel, but 1
wouldn’t press charges.

Apparenrly whoever coined rho rerrn “exrreme soorrs" was
Skipping Journalism elass ro smoke in rho parking 1or the day they
had the lesson on ad;ectives.Thc rerm “extremespcrts." rho header

where on: srands a good ehanee or a skull fracrore, has always
seemed odd ro me. “Brooms" rs an unnecessary adjective, and
rherorore nor only journalistiadly had, but nrsr had in gcncial.

I’ve put up wirh the name wirhour a hghr bemusc, seerarly.

Th is is oil 1 oan rake. Action sporrs, whar makes you so sneeial
rhar you need ro have an oreiring adjective In your name, when
all orher spons musr copE wirh being more nouns? You're nor
doing yoursalrany favors: you just look silly

Look ar orher sporrs and you’ll see whar 1 mean. Football is
nor “hard—inning roorhail," rugby is nor “for—Paced mgby." hockey
is nor “nearly-toothless hockey. " All orrhase descriptions are ima

Mecrarh on rhe motocross eirerrr, but how is rhar any more er.
eirrng rhan warehing Kohe 13ryanr on rho court or Anna

Don'r ger me wrong, 1 have a rromandous arnounr ofmspccl

There‘s no doubt rhar rhose comparirors are every bit rhe athlctc
rhar gymnasrs and swimmers are, lsur why musr rhey eonsranrly

And whar name are we re call rhe former errreme arhleres
