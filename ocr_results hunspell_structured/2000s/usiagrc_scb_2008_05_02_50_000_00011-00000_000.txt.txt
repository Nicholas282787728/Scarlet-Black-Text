BVCHLOE MORVL

It comes every Apnl. on Friday afternoons the dining hall
1s l-111d siege to by 1 swarm ofiictvous high school s1uc1en1°s and
their bewildered parents. They eat oul food invade du1 class-
rooms and for 1 weekend don'nnne 111e college campus. Once
again 1he piospie se1son 111s tillen upon Grinticll College

Prospective students, or “prospies,” frequent Grinnell came
pus after thevve been admitted to the college, with the biggest
trafﬁc during the month of Apiil With May 1 is the national
deadline to accept admittincc to i college, Grinncll only has
11 few weeks to get students to come to campus and convince
them to enroll.

Over three consecutive weekends in April, hundreds ofsttr
dents come to Grinnell college to attend 1 my program that
Admission coordinates to better acquaint admitted students
with the college. During each or these admitted s1ndenr week-
ends, the college hosts approximately 80 students who paillcr
pate in overnight visits lasting one or two nights. Finding hosts
for all ofthesc students is no simple task. For this, the college
looks to the GAP.

The Grinnell Ambassadors Program,or GAP, is an Adi“l$*
sion-afflliated student organization that assists in coordinating
these admitted student weekends. GAP coordinators are paid
positions that are directly linked With the Office of Admission
and are currently filled by Lynn xue '09 1nd Allis Brinkhorst
’11.“As GAP coordmawts, they h1ve a responsibility directly
to the office of admission and to orchestrate and work with a
larger group ofstudents, said Admission counselor Quinton
c11y, who 1s one ofthe administrators in charge ofcoordinating
prospie weekends

This larger group of students volunteers to host ptospies
after go1ng 1hrough 1 prospie training program. The program
m11ches hos1s and prospics based on personal details. “When
a student is trained as a host, there is contact information that
they fill out, including a list of interests, their year and where
1hey’re from,"said Clay. “We keep that in a database so we can
match our hosts with our prospies based on common inter
ests."

Even with this database to help, GAP coordinators said
that admitted student weekends are hectic at best. "We don't
get the list ofprospies until a week before the admitted student
weekend." said Brinkliorst. “So we send out emails to all our

hosts, and if that doesnt work we either set up tables outside
the RC or call people to get hosts."

in addition to the GAP program, the overnight coordina1or
is another volunteer student position that helps with hosting
prospies. ““1 always loved welcoming new people to Grinnell,"
said Megan coenng ‘08, who served as the overnight coordie
liaml’ during the 200612007 school year. “And 11’s fun 1o help
friends and acqnaincances on campus 1s mee1 prospies and
match interests."

While the position is unpaid, overnight coordinators'cam-
pus accommodations 1nclude 11 fairly large room with an adjoin-
ing room containing several beds for prospies to sleep in during
overnights. “The benefit of being an overnight host coordinator
is the huge room," said Clay “It's like their compensation."

Even though it's a strictly volunteer pos111on,Goer1ng said
she really enjoyed her job. “One ofmy very first prespies here is
now one ofmy very best friends, so it was always fun to set up
those kinds ofposslbilities,“said Goeting.

Most students associate Dean of Student Life Jennifer
Krohn with bad news, It is her job to tell students when they
have to live with a bad loommate or their punishment for a
rule infraction. In the midst ofsuch conversations,students can
easily miss her sense of positivity and her
commitment to students, traits for which
her colleagues know her.

But as she prepares to move to 1 new
position in Nouen House as a senior re
search associate, Krohn can now share her
lighter sid&her love ofnature and her be-
loved Bernese Mountain dog, Boomer.

While Krohn's other dog, Beat, passed
away in the fall. she hopes students will be-
gin to get to know Boomer better. “Some
people have seen my dogs—they've seen
Beat and they’ve seen Boomer at the
pancake study breaks," she said, “but they
haven't had the opportunlty to see Beat and Boomer perrorm
or see the time I put into them."

Krohn has always shown and trained her (logs in obedience
and drafting, 1 t1sk in which the dogs pull 1 c111 s1milar to
the milk and cheese carts Bernese Mountain dogs were bred to
pull. “She loves spending time [with dogs]," said L1ura Gogg.
technical assistant for Student Affairs. “That's a real joy father,
1 think because sometimes the things
that she does deal with here are very stress-
ful and very serious."

Krohn’s ability to handle crisis is welle
respected among Student Affairs staff
““When we have 1 Crisis on campus,Jenni-
fer has always been a key player,” said carol
Ahrens, administrative support assistant
for Student Affairs. Krohn has been very
involved 1n responding 1o issues of suicide
and suicide attempts as well as self-harm
Throughout her experience, she is known for her calm in the
midst of difﬁcult situations. “She’s kind of unflappable," said
Joyce Stern '90, dean fol Academic Advising. “And us really

Krohn credits this attitude with the lifeguard job she held
in high school and her work' in the National Ski Patrol ‘1 have
this first»aid background, and I learned how you walk into Sink
ations and assess," she said. “In thisjob I’ve used it all the time. I
know that when you’re faced with a crisis, you have to stay calm,
because everybody else is gomg to be falling
apart."

Krohn's work with students at risk or in HIV
sis has allowed her to develop special relation-
ships with some students. “[The] very exciting
thing is when I've worked with students who
have had mental health issues and have sting-
gled here, struggled very much to be here," she
said, “and 111e11 to see rhern graduate 1nd go
out 111 the world and be rc1lly productive peo

still hear from who had tough times here, but
they're making it in the outside world."

In her role as dean of student life. Krohn
handles crises as well as the bizarteishe’s happy to recount
stories of students stealing golf carts to drive to bais and high
schoolers attempting to scale the outer walls of Gates tower.
With such experience, Krohn has no trouble staying calm when
hearing about the antics of her niece and nephews. “It's like
nothing shocks me. It’s been real fun to talk to [my niece and
nephews] because I just say to them—nothing you say will
shock me," she said, before adding, “YVlieii I
tell them stories, they're shocked."

Krohn’s commitment to her family is well
known amongst those she works with. When
Gogg began to learn about Krohn's relation-
ship with her family, Gogg was surprised 1t
how many family members ICrohn' is close to
