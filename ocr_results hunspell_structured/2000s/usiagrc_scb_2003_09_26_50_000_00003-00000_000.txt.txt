for Grinnell Rennissnnee is to bridge the gap berween rhe
eommuniry nnd rhe srudenr body by advocating commu-
niry involvemenrnnd supportingdowntown groivrh. Allnn
is the ﬁrst college student to be involved with the board,
nnd the ﬁrst srudenr body presidenr ro rske sueh on omeisl
role in eommuniry involvemenr.

As the ﬁrst direct involvement between SGAand Grinv
nell Renaissance, Allan’s position will
help in inform srudenrs or issues rc-
Ivitcd to downtown development. Bill
Menner, the Executive Director of
Grinnell Renaissance, thinks that
Allan’s addition to the board will be
beneﬁcial beoriise she brings or unique
perspeerive as n student. Allan will be
able to alert the board to issues ofstu-
dent interest, such as more downtown
spsrrmenrs or lsrer hours for busi-
nesses. Grinnell Renaissance will for
cos “on downrown developmenr
ro bring people ro rhe downrown nnd
hopefully bring rliem inro businesses,"
said Allan.

ForAllan, being involvcdwitl-i the

Members orcrinnell Renaissance ere concerned rbour
eonneering rhe spheres orounpus ond eomrniiniry. “I done
thlnk the srudenrs owe anything re the communiry, I think
they owe it ro rhenuelves to be psrr or rhis Expcrlencc,”
soid Menner.

By being on rho board orcrinnell Renaissance, Allan
hopes ro supporr rhe downrown nnd increasc rhe inreresr
for piospcorive srudenrs and inculry orrhe college to come
ro rhe area. “Jusr hsving an attractive downtown mrkes
Grinnell an attractive place for potential srudenrs and rec.
ulry," seid Allan.

Two orher srudenss. Linds wells
.05 and csroline Logsn ‘05, have re.
eenily begun a eompus group Focused
on rown issues snd srudenr involve
mont. Their group, the Grinncll Com-
muniry Action Group, is geared ro
melee srudenrs more aware orwhsr rs
ottered downtown. “It’d be easy ro go
ro sehool here end not be involved in
rhe eommuniry. We’d all be missing
out on a lot irwe didn'r get involved,"
said wells.

“It’s a small campus in n small
town, there is no wsy we esn live re.
slly as two sepsrsre enriries," ssrd lb.
gan. “There hss been s tremendous
smounr or eerivism by srudenrs on
campus ror nsrionol esmpsigns l rhink we could focus
that energy on issues in our eommuniry”

wells end Logan wnnr ro roeus on issues signiriisinr to
rhe rownspeople, rather than their own ogendn. ”We want
ro rind rownspeople who are concerned wirh rhese is.
sues nnd rhen work wirh them," said wells.

The euy orcrinnell is in s sore oftenewnl whieh is
being fueled by meny erroris, including crinnell Rendis»
srnee. Six monrhs ago when both dowmown drugsrorcs
and rho rhenrre elosed, thcrc ivos eoncern that the down-
town was dying, rsrr or rhe job oicrinnell Rennsssnee is
to ensure rhsr that does not happen by increasing business
end serviees. Menner enrieipsres rhor rhero vvill be msny

Allen and Mcnncr hope rhnr lrnvmg s renovored the-

a year seeording ro 2m economic impact srudy menrioned
by Menner "Weview [the cinema] oson economieengine
for rhe ennro downrown," ssid Menner.

The rown is enger ro welcome involvemeni from rhe
students. “When we bring rhe eommuniry rogeiher down.
town, irsrudenrs are not there, us not communiry," said
Menner.

In on errorr ro incrense srudenr ownrencss about re.
sourees downtown, GCAG is working on n packet ofin»
formation about town businesses which should be avail-
able on campus in a few weeks.

GCAG nnd Allen believe that srudenu need ro be made
uwrre orrhese resources and both are making an eitorr ro
inoresse consciousness about rhe town and encourage in-
regnrion berween die roWn and srudenrs. “When you're
living here nine or ren monrhs our ofthe year, you should
really rhink orrhe rown otcrinnell as where you live and
start ro use rhe town for rhings," ssid Allan.

Two ways (or srudenrs ro get direcrly involved are ro
volunreer wirh communiry deriviries and ro supporr rhe
local economy and businesses in due downrown disrrier.
“one ofthc rhings I rhrnk really helps rhough is rhe come
