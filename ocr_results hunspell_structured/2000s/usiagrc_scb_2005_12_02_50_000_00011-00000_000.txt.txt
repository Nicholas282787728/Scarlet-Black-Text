As the end of the semester approaches,
we are all bracing ourselves for the stress,
sleepless nights and anti—social behavior
that mark the end of every Grinnell term.

This is the ﬁrst semester with a buf-
fer day and the faculty and administration
have made other admirable steps in lessen-
ing stress while maintaining an academi-
cally rigorous —
environment.

We should
applaud efforts
to give students

Professors now
prevent pro-
crastination on
essays through
final paper
timetables and
reduce end of the year stress by schedule
ing projects in the middle of the semester,
rather than at the end.

We should be grateful that our lobbyc
ing for buffer days and more mental health
resources on campus has yielded real re-
sults.

But we should also be making efforts
to turn inward to stave off the stress of the
final weeks ofthe semester. We need per

Some of us will cry. Some of us will

will not eat right or sleep enough. Many
of us will drink too much on the days we
can to make up for the seemingly endless

Taking an “incomplete" ina class won't

So this hell week, when work has us
hanging on to our sanity by our finger
nails, let’s take a deep breath, take a televi-

to our shiny new PEC or talk to friends
and family, who will love us regardless of

Real academic freedom

At Grinnell, most students take at least a
few discussionrbnscd courses. For optimum
learning in discussion courses, students and
profcssors should be free to say, read and think
what they want, as long as they do not infringe
on another person's rights.

The American Association of University
Professors states that professors are responsible
for presenting their own viewpoints in class,
prioritizing the “truth as they see it" rather
than mythical objective or “balanced" knowlc
cdgc.‘ But classes at Grinnell are about more
than listening to lectures. We learn a lot not
only from profes—
sors but from each
other.

There are some
classroombehaviors
that impede learn-
ing, however, and
although we are all
free to engage in them, I recommend that we
stop. Im not talking about the shameless at»
tempts to participate in discussions when you
haven’t done the reading (although this should
only be done during hell week, when no one
else has read either).

consider the following scenario: You are
sitting in class and miraculously have complete
ed all of the reading, You
are eager to ask questions
and expicss your opinion,
but seared because you
read about a controversial
issue and you don’t want to
be misundersrood. Do you
censor yourself and attempt to be politically
correct? Do you sit silently, afraid to offend?
Do you turn to classmates who you think will
have berrcr insight based on something you
know about them? Do you blurt out the first
thing that comes to mind?

In an actdemlc setting, there is no such
thing is “common sense." Ways orcxpressing
ourselves, being understood, and understand
ing others are learned in the classroom. Stu-
dents should not avoid talking about contro»
verslal issues because they arc afraid to offend
someone. lrwc avoid controversy, we leave the
classroom with misconceptions intact.

Learning requires attention to conﬂict——
learningabouthistoricalconflictanddiirerencc
and learning to interact with current conﬂicts
and diffcrcnce.Thc times I have learned most
have been times I was most uncomfortable and
forced to rc-evaluflte things I previously held

cussants to clarify their positions and generally
learn to express themselves to others.

Rather than (ensonng unsettling

history behlnd controversial toplrs

lcngcs to their personal beliefs in the class-
room, SAF criticizes what it calls “liberal bias"
in the classroom in order to promote an agcnr
da oflimiting trcc discussion and exchange of
ideas} Conservative activist David Horowitz
has spearheaded a national movement to leg-
islate the “Academic Bill of Rights” he created
to ensure what he calls "political diversity” in
the expense of freedom to rhink and express
ideas. Horowitz's followers decry "indoctrina-
tion" even as they hypocritically try to create a
situation in which administrators rather than
students and professors, experts in their areas,
would dictate clasr
room discussion.
Horowitz co—opts
the rhetoric of “dis
vcrsit'y" and “equal
ity" to mandate that
all professors teach
right-wing polirical
ideologies they disagree with and avoid “cons
troversy'This bill to limit student learning has
already passed in 16 states.

Rather than censoring unsettling ideas,
students should interrogate the history has
hind controversial topics. Controversy' in an
academic scrriiig can bc po ' ally charged
wirhout degenerating into partisan legislative

battle. Avoiding academic
debate means avoiding
learning.

Some of the most con-
troversial topics in my'ch
perlencc or Grinnell have
been racial epithets or canr
onized “great thinkers" in one area who hold
prejudices in another. Thankfully, Grinncll
students are still allowed to raise these pressing
issues in college classes. In one of my English
classes lasr year, the professor asked for volun-
teers to read aloud a poem that repeated the
word “nigger." Before we got into the poem,
we had a snldcntrinitiated discussion about
the politics of saying the word aloud in a class—
room setting.

We camc to a consensus that excising the
word from our discussion would mean ignore
ing its historical as well as literary signiﬁcance
and were able to move on to discuss how form
and diction (including the word "niggci") in-
formed meaning. Alrhough almostcvcryonc in
the class seemed to feel uncomfortable, many
students and the professor said they were glad
to have had the conversation. Why? In the case
ofthis specific example, students are orren rc—
luctant to say racial or other epirhcrs ar rlie risk
ofinvoking the violence associated with these
words. in English classes, it is often necessary
to articulate the words in order to analyze the
concepts they represent.

This specific example cvinces on a more

general level that students should encourage
discussions ofthe plethora of“difﬁcult" or “ta-
boo” topics across disciplines when they come
up in assigned reading. lr is counterproductive
to jump right into these topics Without first
establishing common theoretical ground for
discussion and worse to avoid discussion all
togetherr

so we've ruled out silence, censorship and
political correctness as viable options to solve
the problem of controversy. wc are talking
with our classmates and taking into account
their perspectives, But creating an environs
merit in which classmates are free to speak is
not the same as asking them to speak from a
certain voice or perspective. Students should
not make assumptions about another’s life as
perienees, knowledge or standpoint based on
ascription to a particular social group. Singling
out a student to speak as the representative of
a group to which he or she belongs is never a
good idea

Students may volunteer information about
their personal experiences as members ofpar-
ticular groups but should never be asked to
speak as representatives of an entire people.
This sort of tokenism perpetuates the misc“,
caption that there is a monolithic “black cul-
turc,"“malc perspective,”“dlsablcd experience,”
“gay identity," etc. whcn in tact people who are
black, men, homo xual or have disabilities
also have a mulripl ity ofperspcotivcs on any
given issue. Asking in class that someone act is
spokesperson for a racial, ethnic, gender, sexual
orienration, religious, ability or other group is
rcducrive and detrimental to learning.

Grinnell College's mission statement cites
“free inquiry" as a priority As organizations
like Students for Academic Freedom try to
erode academic freedom, Grinnell students
should seek more actively to 'protect it. We
must also recognize the position of controversy
In the ideology of“Academic Freedom."

What is the role of Conﬂict in learning?
How can we respect our classmates each time
we enter an academic discussion? SAF claims
that controversy infringes on students’ rights
to their own beliefs. In fact, embracing propa-
ganda or thc monolithic pcrspecrivcs ofsupcrr
ficial political correctness, relying on rokenism
and avoiding debates infringe on students'
right to learn. We have the right to challenge
onc another‘s beliefs as wcll as to change or
find new evidence for our existing opinions.
