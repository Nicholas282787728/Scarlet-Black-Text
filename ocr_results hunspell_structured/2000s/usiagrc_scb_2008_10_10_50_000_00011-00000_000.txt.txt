Grinnell’s newest sports club looks to sa

BY CHARLES NETZER

Sailing, a sport once limited to the deni-
zens of the coast, has come to the heartland.
Although sailing has long been a standby of
the physical education curriculum, it did not
exist as ‘il club sport, until now. Ben Brewer
'llirlic photo editor ofthe 5558, in conjunc-
tion With the Director ofGORP David Zciss,
created the Grinncll Sailing club earlier this
year by appropriating the old
physical education sailing
equipment. The club cur-
rently sails at Rock Creek on
Fridays and Sundays,

currently, the club is
recruiting and training new
sailors, but hopes someday
to compete against other
colleges. Jonah Ellrnan '12, a long time sailing
cnthusiaslrsaid,“l can see [the club] growing a
lot. We could deﬁnitely be competitive in the
Midwest within a few years,"

The boats are shuttled on Friday and Sun-
day to Rock Creek using trailers and a GORP
van, and will continue to do so until Old Man
Winter strikes. Ellinan expressed a wish to
change that mode of transportr “We can't take
that many people out," he said, “1 think Rock
Creek is a state park, so we went to deal with
the state to build a boathouse there.” The Uni-
versity of lowa sailing team, with whom the
Grinnell sailing club competes, already has a
similar arrangement with the state oflewa.

Currently however, the boats' availability
limits the competitive spirit of the club mem-

’We (DU/d definitely be
tamper/live m the Midwell
within a fewyears.”

bCI'S. The club has ﬁVC bouts left over fiom the
physical education classes, but they are not of
the calibre necessary for racing, "We're thinks
ing about getting thrce F] [competition class]
boats so we can actually ptactice sailing on the
boats we will cite,"Ellman said. "They’re big-
ger, so we can also rake out more people and
teach people to sail more efficiently,"

The laiger size of F] class boats allows
multiple crew members,
thus making the F] model
ideal for tutorials, The club
estimates the cost ofrlie ups
grade at $2,000 to 33,000
a boat but will sell the old
boats the offset that price.
“I deﬁnitely want to see the
club more in a competitive
direction," said Ellman.

The students ofGrinnell seem enthusiastic
about the new club, at least those who knew
about it. Although many were unaware ofthe
club's existence, students responded warmly
to the idea of a new club sport, especially in
a sport as well established as sailing, “I didn't
know about it," said Lexi Leuszler '12. “But I
have a friend who sailed in high school and I
have to tell her!"

Sebastian De Pasquale '12 expressed simie
lar appreciation for the new club. Although he
admitted he would not join the club, he said,
“ll"s Grinnell. We have clubs for everything.
It'd be even cooler if it [became] a vaisity
sport.”

The bane of Jordan’s existence: professional sports

Sports are never going to be perfect.
Human error will always play a prominent
toie— even if it’s just programming and
manufacturing robot referees—and beiat-
ing Ed Hochuli to the point that he snaps
and starts punching (:VCrytliing in sight isn’t
going to solve the problem. There are. hOWe
ever, some rules and structures that can be
changed to make out sporting experiences
even more enjoyable. As I am more than
qualiﬁed to criticize institutions that are rak-
ing in hundreds ofmillions of dollars a year,
here are various solutions I’ve concocted to
solve some of the more glaring problems.

Ma’or League Baseball

I'v: ked the Chicago Cubs to win the
World Series the past are years, and for the
past nvo years they have been swept in the
first round ofthe playoffs. Clearly the prob
lem does not lie with my prognostication
skillsiwhich are as accurate as a Jason Kidd
jurnp shotibut with the format ofthc play-
offs itself It is incredibly difficult to make
the postseason in baseball, more so than any
of the other major sports, yet once they get

there it seems like they try to go with the
smallest sample size possible to determine
the champion. By small sample size I am, of
course, referring to baseball's Division Series,
There is absolutely no reason why the Divie
sion Series is only five
games. Both the NBA
and NHL recently res
alizcd that their first
rounds should be best
of seven.

The fact that these
leagues have a higher
percentage of teams that make the postsea—
son and a shorter regular season makes the
ALDS and NLDS seem even morc ridiCUr
lous. I’m not saying this is the reason the
Cubs lostilord knows I can only stand to
see Kosuke Fukudomc look at another first
pitch fastball down the middle to many
tim657but a near liundrcdewin team should
have more than three games to ptovc their
woith. Do owners not want to make more
money on extra playoff games? This makes
about as much sense as having a coin flip

 

determine home field advantage for a one
game playoff.

Another solution is to revoke all rights of
the Baseball Writers Association of Amer-
ica. Sure they have nothing to do with the

actual game itself, but

i know my life would

be less rageefilled if

they didn't vote for

postseason awards or

. decide who initially

makes the Hall of

Fame. i swear, ifJustin

Motncau or Dustin Pcdroia wins the IVIVP

award over Joe Mauer,1'm going to go on a

tirade that will make Hal McRae look like
Mike Huckabcc,

ﬂ

it’s simple, make the regular season lon-
ger. Sixteen games are not nearly enough
to cuib my LenDale Whiteelike appetite {oi
the NFL, especially when l rarely get to see a
17th, studies havc suggested that the nilcrr
age life expectancy of a former NFL player
is over 20 years less than the general popula-

tion,Tl‘ial is not nearly a wide enough gap.
lwant these players playing so many games
that they die shortly after they retire.

A second way to improve the NFL would
be to set up a series of cameras around the
stadium making instant replay a viable op—
tion in more cases, I am sick and tired of
having a replay system that relies on three
cameramen, all at unhelpful angles, and can
never help determine the proper spot of the
ball. If they are going to make complexes
in excess of a billion dollars, the least they
could do is add this practical feature.

NHL

Ityou want to ﬁx hockey it's simple. Kill
the Bettman.

lfyou Want to take a more “legal" route,
you could cut the regular season in lialfand
make the postseason four times its previous
length. Also, under this new format, The
Conn Smythe winner will be awarded to the
player on the winning team with the finest
heard, thus eliminating Sydney Crosby from
contention.
