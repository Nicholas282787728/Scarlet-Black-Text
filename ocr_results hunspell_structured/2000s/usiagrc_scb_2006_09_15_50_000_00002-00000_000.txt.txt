BY ARPl KARAPETVAN

After 12 yetils orhelping Grinnell studcnrs and alumni rind

assistant dean at the University at Iowa college of Law after
Sept. 22. His replacement at Gtinnell has not been chosen.

Langerud hopes to iikc the experience and skills he aer
quircd during his time at cr-irinell and help the University of

Giinnell students know totiay.

Langenid said rhat when he ﬁrst began working at the

that time, many positions including thiee director level posi-
tions,nn assistant dirctror position and clean position, have been
cierited. Funding has also increased from $20,000 tO $400,000.
He cites Grinnell's enthusiasm for helping its snidcnrs succeed
after graduation as the reason for the increase in resources over
the past few years.

“I’m really grateful to the college for putting that kind of
support into the program,"Larrgcnrd said. “That all means that
students are getting to do things that they simply could not do
before,"

During the latter part of his time at
Grinnell, Langerud helped current students
and alumni decide what they wanted out of
their lives by simply talking to them.

The CDC helps studenrs gcr internships,
fill out resumes, and apply to post-graduate
programs like Grinnell Corps.
