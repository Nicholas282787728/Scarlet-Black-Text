To rnost, Valentines Day is the holiday, which is popua
larly considered to be the bane of the single persons exisr
tence. To others, it is the reason why so many people are
born' in November

February 14 takes Grinnellian awkwardness to another
level. The weeks leading up to it can end up being a nasty
Russian roulette of ﬁnding love. To take away from the

frustration, students have taken somewhat ingenious age “One Eerson is gonna get that note that says,
”One person is gonna get

’10 will be taking herself out to the movies
to see Valentine's Day.

“I think that the movies that come out
on Valentine’s Day are exciting," saniple
said. “I’m excited to see Ashton Kutcher, fel»
low Iowan, on screen.” Sample‘s choice reﬂects the tasteful
perspective that seeing a movie alone can be self-reward—

Others have taken a more daring approach—confessing
their love. Harpreet Singh ‘12 will be inserting a dozen ros-

“I‘m gonna show them, ‘Thanks. You’ve
been a good friend to me,'" Singh said. He
also will be leaving a note for a special some
one. Singh wouldn't reveal the person’s iden-
tity—he wanted to keep it off the record.
‘I’m feelin’ you," Singh said. “I
hope you feelin‘ me.’"

Field said.

But one Grinnelian has taken Valentine’s
Day and given it an entrepreneurial bent—
a lesbian dating service. -Batenian calls his
quasi-business CLIT—Crazy Lesbians Introduced by
Thomas.

Bateman operates under the opinion that sooner or
later, throughout a women’s (our years here, she eventually
becomes queer. But she doesn‘t know who's queer, so in
comes Eater-nan,

Birkenstocks section ofshce stores and the
ﬂannel section of Second Mile,” Bateman
said. “So, hervveen these ﬁve general loca»

According to Baternan, hes had a few
successful matches Two ofhis friends Etc

He’s now taken pride in his new subspe-

as Anna and Anna. After graduation, Batenian hopes to
expand his {aux-business in the big city and expand the
CLIT franchise. "I'm gonna host scissor suarees,” Bateman
said. “Lesbian ski»getaways at Lodge Lesbo. My lesbian
lodge in the Alps!"
