Construction
hits central
campus
parking spots

BY DAVID DRISCOLL

A year after campus construction
led the college to issue more student
parking permits than spaces, the col,
legc’s parking situation continues to be
in flux.

The demolition of Darby Gym
last year and the ongoing remodeling
of Noyce’s biology wing have reduced
parking in central campus, leaving
only the lots offSth Ave. and near the
Forum. However, according to Vice
President of institutional and Budget
Planning Marci sortor, several lots
next to and behind the new athletic
center and north of Norris were built
this past summer and the lot near the
Security Office was expanded. This
brings the total number of parking
spaces to 255 for students and 82 for
students, faculty or staff, said Stephen
Briscoe, director of security.

Some construction workers, part
of the Noyce addition and the campus
center work have been parking in cen-
tral campus faculty slots, according to
Sortor. Forty permits have been issued
for construction workers, who have
been asked to park near the athletic
center.

The new athletic center lots are
temporary The center is planned to
eventually expand over those lots once
funding has been obtained for another
stage of construction. According to
Sorter, parking may replace the old
PEC at this phase. Also, there will be
a small parking lot with some handle
capped spaces alongside the Rosen-
field Center.

“There is always a tension between
our green spaces and our parking spires
es,” said Sortor. “And so it's difficult to
think about how we would squeeze
[parking] in there [near the campus
center]. I can see how it would be re
ally useful.”

For many, the parking debate is
largely a question ofhow central came
pus should be used. Students have
mixed reactions. Dale Mackey ’07 says
"I think it's good to get the parking
lots out of central campus, like on the
outskirts, just because they're ugly. I
don’t think the campus should be filled
with parking lots."

The removal of the Noyce lot, on
the other hand, exasperares Professor
sam Rebelsky, computer science, an
outspoken advocate for better faculty
parking conditions. He said that the
lot last spring was often full by 7:55
am, and ifhe can’t park there, his class
es would start late.

"If you think about almost any
other campus, anywhere in the U.S.,
sometimes the closest lots would be as
close as the farthest lots we have here,"
Sorror said. “It's going to be difficult
for a couple ofycars.l think some otus
may have to do a little walking, too."

Harriet Dickey-Chasins '82 elected

Despite registration complications for some students, alum wins atjlarge seat by wide margin

BV DAVID MONTGOMERV AND

RACHEL FIELDS

Grmned alumna Harriet Dickeye
Chasins ’82 was elected to the Glinnellt
Newberg School Board over incumbent
Randy Lidtka on Tuesday, after .m of
ftcially non—partisan campus campaign
marked by debates over evolution and
antitdiscriminarion policies,

The ﬁnal margin was wide, but
came after an extensive campaign by
the Grinnell campus Democrats. In
the first ward, which includes the col-
lege lies, as percent voted for Dickcye
Chasins.

Approximately two weeks before
the election, the campus Democrats
put up posters around campus attack-
ing Lidtka’s statements against textt
books supportive of evolution and the
district's bullying policy that condemns
harassment on the basis of several fac-
tors, including sexual orientation.

“The posters were an attentiont
grabber," said Hannah Gatdcn'MonT
heir ’08, a co-leader of the Campus
Democrats. They were taken down be-
cause of concern that the posters “came
across a little stronger than intended,"
she said.

DickeyeChasins said that from
what she had heard, she was “uncom-
fortable"with the initial posters.

School board elections are OfﬁcialT
ly nonpartisan, although Lidtk-a is a
member of the Fowcshiek county Re-

publican central committee.
Gﬂl'dchNlonl‘lclt said that the
Campus Democrats support of Dick-
ey-Chasms was nuntparrisan "[Dtelt-
eyeChasins] is a Giinnell alum, her
beliefs coincide with ours."
Dickethhassins was thankful that
the campus Democrats had encourt
aged people to vote. “I really support
students having passion about these is
sues," she said. “But to the extent that

”The posters were an attention-
grabber...”

there was an anti-Randy or an antic
Harriet campaign,l wish people would
vote FOR something."

The campus Republicans did not
do any campaigning. "We didn't feel
comfortable enough to endorse or go
againsta certain candidate,"said chair-
person Derek Bates ’08. The Republi-
cans did provide voter registration in
formation to members.

Despite the Campus Democrat's
voting registration campaign apparent
impact on the Dickethhasin's victory,
not all students affected the election.

thn Ted Cooper '09 and his
friends turned up to vote at the Griuuell
polls on Tuesday, September 13, they
were turned away.

Cooper registered to vote outside
Qtad a few days artcr class registration
and he decided to vote in the local clec-
tion. Cooper and several of his friends
were told that they were not registered.
According to Julie Bit '09, several stu-
dents had to ﬁll out their registration
sheets a second time.

“The story was that our forms had
been sent to someone’s house on the
day they were due at the courthouse,"
said Cooper. “It was a little upsetting."
He added that two of his friends were
able to vote, and that he assumed the
mistake was due to the time or place
that he registered.

An e-mail from the campus Deme
ocrats attributed the mistake to a mist
communication between the group and
the voting auditor, Jo Wray Due to an
error, the completed forms were not de-
liveer to the courthouse on the correct
date, resulting in incomplete registrar
tion for several students.

Though the Democrats said they
received around ﬁve or six complaints.
it is unclear how many students had in
com lete registrations.

“ It’s important to vote] because we
are living here,"said Bir,

Bir said that, despite complications,
she will vote in elections to come. Coot
per agreed. “The Grinnell school SySt
rem atteete whether proressors want to
raise kids here," he said. “It's deﬁnitely
important to our education,"
