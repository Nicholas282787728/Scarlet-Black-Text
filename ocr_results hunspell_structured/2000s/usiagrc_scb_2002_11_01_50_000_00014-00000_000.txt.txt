I’m spending my senior year abroad. That's

srudanrs speak out
about what’s on
their minds in 142
words, and you're
invited! If you have
a random rant, email
it to me at
alwald@ynnnell.odu.
After all, complain-
ing in a public forum
is always more fun
than doing it alone.

an the importance of being anorexic

I have misplaced my P—card. I refuse to believe it’s
lost, because 1 reruse to go to Dining Services to pay
my second $25 only to have the freakin' thing turn up
two days later. But in its absence what am Itn do? I
can't eat at the dining halls. I can’t go to the forums
WelL I could but I’m not going to pay anymore money
when I already have a meal plan that never sees the
dim light in Quad or the saved-by—therbellaesque archi-
tecture of Cowles.

Since Dining Services Won't let me give them my
student ID numberI can only induce that they are con-
doning anorexia. Either pay us an exorbitant amount of
money or STARVEH See if we case. Why? "Because we
proﬁt when you starve." The new motto of Dining Ser-
vices,

—0rariol‘te H25; '04

Why AREN’T we feeding the starving children? Why
do boys have no emotions? Why does anyone care
about computer labs? Computer labs just hurt my head.
I like to focus on issues for ﬁve minutes and then do
something more fun, Like think about having happy
little bouncy babies. Giggly babies. BabiesE Quintu-
plets, perhaps! Who needs academics? Who needs
newspapers? Who needs boys (after the babies are an
the way)? And most deﬁnitely who needs computer
labs? Babies! Babies don't want computers! 0r news-
papers! Dr textbooks! Or even Ormami! They just
want to giggle and bounce and never ever cry or make
baby messes That's why I lave babies. And why
everyone should love babies. Even more than furry
kittens and fuzzy monkeys and little bitty biggies.

You’ve got mail! Get out of my way

Vou know whatI hate? I hate when people like
you check their post ofﬁce box, and then open and
read their mail while still standing in front of their
post ofﬁce box. See, when you stand in front of your
own post ofﬁce box, that means you are standing in
front of about 30 other people’s Pal). boxes, and they
can't get their mail. Then they stand behind you, and
another person stands behind them, and then I can't
walk or move and I deﬁnitely can’t check my mailbox
to make sure that it is still empty, like yesterday and
the day before. Oh, and for Christ’s sake, don’t open
and read your mail on the stairwell either. Get your
mail, and getout of my way, you show-offs, With all or
your mall.
