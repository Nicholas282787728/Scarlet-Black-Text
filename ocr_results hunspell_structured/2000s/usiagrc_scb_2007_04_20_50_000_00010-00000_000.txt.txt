The Pursuit of Happyness
(2006)

ateoe

The book behind TIM Pm'alul ofHap/tynerr must
be fascinating. At least, every scene ottlre movie kept
pioinpting me to consider the reality behind the stu-
ry. While there are some gieat images and confront
tations with the reality of poverty, mostly the movie
does little more than embody the clichéd Hollywood
“rags-to-richcs" trope.

Based on the real life stoiy of Cl'lHS Gardner,
played here by wrli smirh, Pullzlir inrroduces us to
a srngle father and his son (played by Smith's real life
son, Jaden) lrving in San Francisco during the urban
depression of the 1980s. Ambitiously, Gardner atr
tempts to care for his family by responding to an ad
prornisrng he'll earn up to $1000 per week Ofcolll'sc,
it's a grand scheme, and Gardner is left with multiple
worthless bone density scanners, a towing ticket and
apaitinei-it ient,

one day as he srrolls thorough downtown trying
to make a pitch, Gardner crrcounrers a stock broker.
Cue the predictable story of following the American
dream. Gardner applres for a stock broker luterrr
ship. impresses his boss (by almost completrnv a Rut
bix cube) and is offered an internship, only to realize
whrrt college students have known for years: intern-
ships don’t pay,

Of course, the catch' is that only one intern is of—
fcied a job, A Job that would give rlris young door- -to»
door salesman a rnrllrourure's salary.

Here, the story gets a lrttle more rnttrgaring. While
the ruaiu story continues ro focus on Gardner's strug-
gle to impress the hen out of his bosses, co-workers
and customers—which we all know he'll succeed at
and got the job—this is also a story about poverty and
single parenthood.

Forced from their apartment, then from the
weekly hotel until finally they have to seek shelter,
Gardner continues to feed his son lines about every
Americans right tothe pursuit orhappincss, wirilc at
the same time trying to keep him ignorant about the
destlmllon they are facing.One ofthe most touching
moments rs Immediately after they have lost their ho-
tel room, her and son share a bench in the subway
tunnel. Rea Llng hi son's confusion, Gardner makes
the situation into a imaginary game. The two ﬂee
from a Tchx into the protection oftheii' “prehistoric
cave" (also known as a subway toilet), But even here,
mi inatioii cannot shelter them {mm the rudeness

Though it ultimately fails to live up the task. the
movie ti ies to ask, what does it take to be a good far

to be that money nor only ends poverty, but magically
makes you a good parent as well

After watching Pruner, l was intrigued enough
to do a little bit of research on the real Chris Gardr
not (who makes a cameo appearance). Gardner has

The movie is ambitious, bur it cant live up the real

When the Lost Film Fest VlSIIBd Giimicll last
year, riewers took rn a tlrppant piece about throwing
pies at politicians, a report on pimte television blOild’
casting in Italy documentation of anarchist clashes
with polrce and footage ofan adorably dadaist clown
brigade that stops trafﬁc in full circus reg iliri.

Tonights event promises to bring a similarly
eclectic slice of noiirinainstrcani culture. It will also
include performances by M71 of underground hip
hop duo Dead Prez.

Originating in Philadelphia, the Lost Film Fest
now travels regulaily under the command of‘VJ’ Scott
Beiben. The festival features a mix of socml activist
films intended to excite the audience’s intellect. The
content generally revolves around the cluster otleftist
earl-corporate movements such as anarchy, rllegal art,
culture jamming and pranking.

The films vary as widely in quality as they do in

content Some are hltlngly funny, or- surprisingly poi-
gnant while others drag along, desperately rn need of
some serious editing work and nariative direction. Of
course, this divcisity' is pan of the ambiance of the
Lost Film Fest, It's a celebration of all things outside
of the rnarnstrearrr, so the producers would probably
vicw sclccriug only well-polished, professionally pror
drrced films as a perversion of their mission.

The festival is a decidedly lowaech affair, Bciben
connects his laptop diiectly to a projector to show the
films (on the bright side, Bcibcu claims to hold more
than 200 showings a year. so the chance of massive
rechnical failule is probably much smaller than your
average Harris movie). In between pieces, he talks
about the context for the films, relates anarchic ant
ecdotes and discusses his personal involvement in
radical movements. Isle inreracts frequently with the
audience, giving the event a personal feel, although
Grinnellian apathy tempered last year's crowd ll'l’

This year, the test' rl is touring with M—l, one
half of the popular h' shop duo Dead Prez. Mel
will trade sets with the trim showings, and his pet
litically charged style should complement the media
presentation nicely, and vice versa. M—l has been
involved in black activism for a long time, from the
Black Panthers to Friends of lVllll‘nlrl1\bl| lamal, so
his background meshes well with the auti- :Stubllsl‘l’
merit theme of the festival Hopefully. the live sets
will help energize the crowd and break up the pr-ocese
siou of homegrown videos, giving the event a more
heterogeneous feel

The Lost Film Fest has some unabashedly rough
cdges, bur fans of homegrown actrvisrn and amateur
filmmaking will find a lot to like. Grinnellians might
rind it alrgns nrcely with our prrzed sentiments of
iionconformlty and indrvidrral expression, That is, if
we can take a long enough break from text messaging
our friends on our cell phones. - .
