Grinnell should follow marketing promises, not Madoff

Bernie Madoff, the Ponz‘i mastermind that swindlcd £50
billion from his investors, has mesmerized our nation in re»
cent months. His surname has even permeated the American
lexicon, as the term “Madoff” is now synonymous with “fraud."
Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman
deemed our financial system "the Bernie Madoff of econo—
mies,” and several media outlets have labeled the largerseale
banks that invested in risky, mortgage-backed securities as “le»
gal Madoffs."

Though no “Madoffs of higher education" have emerged
just yet,1 think the No Limits Project (NLP) struck a resonant
chord in the letter to the seas last Friday, pointing out the con—
trast “between the rhetoric used for marketing of the College
and the reality on campus."

We all came to Grinnell expecting a fair place precisely
because of such marketing, yet we’ve encountcred so many
instances where our institution lags behind its soaring values.
For me, the most glaring example came in my second year at a
large study-abroad orientation. There, an administrator began
his presentation With a slide depicting a subrSaliaran African
man dressed in traditional regalia, alongside the phrase “Cul-
ture Shock."Unformnalely, this display more closely resembled
the human zoos that captivated our popular culture in the early
20th century than an educational presentation. This ptesenrar
non encapsulated the notion of“third world voyeurisnispopm
lrirized by the British critic Alice Miles.

Professor Max Leung, Assistant Professor ofsociology, said
ofthis incident,”0fall the images, he chose a tribal black man,
That’s problematic because it invokes a discourse of primiriw
ism. and a place ofdcsolation that no one else wants to be in.
Sadly, this way ofusing race to represent a place of ‘cthetness' is
rather common in popular discourse because it's so easy to use."

Ltung proceeded to tie the incident to the increasingly in-

sensitive institution that facilitated it. “When you do nor have
institutional accountability to ensure that these practices aren’t
replicated at a College administrative level. then it should sure
prise no one that you get screwed up sniffliitc that,"lic said.

Clearly, this man did not stop and think about the wa a
student from Africa would have felt had they been sitting in
that room. He certainly didn’t know how it made me feel, espe-
cially given the fact that not too long ago, my ancestors didn’t
look and dress very difrcrently from his Madame Butterﬂy fig
ure,

The saddest part of this story is that this man has faced no
repercussions for his action, And no one expected President Osr
good to reprimand hiinitwould have
obligated Osgood to discontinue his
dornothlng leadership style. indeed,
the “Ten Years in Review" link at the
President's Office webpage hilariously
resembles the Bush administration’s
“accomplishments and results" book-
let, released a few weeks before W. left
office, Both lists are cluttered with “accomplishments" that now
either lack funding or are on the verge ofettiuction In any case,
all of Osgoad's real accomplishments have been overshadowed
by tremendous fiscal mismanagement and gaping unpopularity

Though the pro. sn't one of the major emblems of
Osgood's failed tenure, it reminds us ofthc damage that racism,
as subtle and inadvertent as it may be, can carry, and therefore
the importance ofthings like A Just training and the No Lime
its Project. While the NLP saga continues, I draw upon this
personal and visccntl experience in hopes of enabling the stir
dent body to better understand where the NLP students come
from. While I concede that I’m one ofinany people here who
have beneﬁted from immense privilege, [urge students to try

The

putting themselves in other people's shoes. As Griiiellians, we
get irritated with pretentious peers pontificating in class, so try
and fathom how painful it must feel to receive hate mail, bear
nuanced racism, or watch the administration chuck your schol-
arship away for a plasma TV. Maybe then students will better
understand the need for a hate crime response policy, greater
diversity and more financial aid.

I’m frankly chagrined with the pettiness of the NLP's criti—
cisms, ranging from “self serving," to “too confrontational," to
"idealistic," to the most tisiblc yet—that they employ exceed-
ingly“sketchy petitioning.”The most frequent (and misguided)
claim is that the College cannot enact these demands, some of

which are expensive, because of the
deteriorating economy—we should
save money instead. These critics
don’t seem to realize that they pose
the exact same strategy that has
failed us in the last decade. In fact,
the NLP proffers creative and en—
lightened ways to dole out our cash,
and by extension, live up to the College’s mission statement,

Ofcoursc, Grinncll's administration does not represent the
total ethical collapse symbolized by Bernie Madoff. But so long
as our endowment spending contradicts our values, out con-r
niuuity’s diversity remains stagnant, and aloof administrators
can victiinizc students with no disciplinaiy recourse, a tranche
of Miidoffdoes exist right here in Grinnell. Like the business
man's investors, it's Grinnell students and their parents, many
of whom have devoted their entire lives to service, who lose.
They send their children here thinking that Grinnell is ajust
and socially Conscious place. Thousands of dollars and almost
four years later, it stairs to become clear that it’s too often one
big lie.

Call foran external review of hiring and firing processes

Review or the hiring and firing at Grinn’ell

Last week, the SSLB reported on the circumstances [surv
rounding the hiring of Dean of Students Travis Greene and
the departure of Sheree Andrews,
former Associate Dean and Direc~ .
tor of Residence Life. our report-
ing was based on claims made in
ii facultyrwritten document, which
constructed a nai-i- u've detail»
ing both cases—argdng Andrews
was released in an underhanded
manner and that Greene’s hiring
recalled a Boss Tweed spoils system. While search committee
melnhcrs~smdents and staff alikeirejected the allegations
surrounding the Dean of Students search, the 58:35 review of
Andreas personnel tile and other reporting revealed circum-
stances that seem suspicious at the least.

While the Andrews case may be the most visible and con»
tentious, it is not the only instance of circumspect hiring and
firing in Student Affairs. For these reasons, we believe the
planned external review of administrative hiring and tiring
practices is iiisutficienr. Instead ofjust a campus-wide review
which can dilute the ﬁndings of each individual office, we de-
mand one specifically focused on Student Affairs, the ofﬁce
that has raised the most questions in this area. And, just as
importantly, the review should be conducted, if at all possible,
before the end of the year so that its progress and results can be

Staff-Edi

monitored by all campus members, students, faculty and staff
alike.

Before proceeding, we want to be clear that this is not a
commentary on whcdier any individual should or should not
have been hired, ﬁred or retained. Pet-
sonncl decisions are highly nuanced and
contextual; we do not pretend that we
can make those decisions from an outsid-
ers‘ perspective. We are instead concerned
with the process by which those decisions
arc made. which often seem questionable
at best. Ultimately, appropriate polit s are
not concerned with the final decision, but
rather the way in which that decision was reached,

In Andrews’ case, three points lead us to ask for external
investigation. First, none ofthc reasons stated in either the cor
rective action form issued by Greene or in the termination lets
ter by Vice President for Student Affairs Houston Dougharty
seem to warrant dismissal. Missing meetings and not icspond-
ing to e~mails, while problematic, can be commonplace in a
hectic ofﬁce and, in the light ofa serious personal crisis, seem
especially trivial. Second, Andrews was served her termination
just one business day after the corrective action form,which is
insufficient time for an employee to improve their performance.
Finally, there is a clear and puzzling discrepancy in the pet-fat-
mance reviews issued by Doughatty and those issued by Tom
Crady, Andrews’ former boss.

Student Affairs administrators have offered a constant i-e-

. aria .,. a he vs.

tarial

{rain about the need to ‘professionalizc" the division and cast
as wide a net as possible in hiring. Despite this rhetorical com-
mitment to more stringent policies, the hiring process for the
Assistant Director of Residence Life position occupied by
Kim Hinds-Brush did not seem to adhere to these standards.
instead of conducting it iigerous national search, as \was the
case for every other Student Affairs opening this year, includ»
ing RLCs, division higher-ups seemed to merely have placed
Hinds-Brush in the newly created position without any effort
it looking elsewhere. students on this campus greatly- admire
Hinds-Brush and wished her to stay and she has excelled
thanks to her great familiarity with the College, its culture and
institutions. But, as in other ins ices, the process ﬂew in the
face of the division’s stated practices.

A final discrepancy is evident in the qualifications for cer-
tain jobs tilled in the past years While the job posting for the
Associate Dean position required five years posrmaster's expe-
rience, the Dean of Students position required only four years.

, We at the SSLB do not feign to know the circumstances
of these hiring and firing decisions However, the questionable
nature of these decisions casts suspicion across the entire divi-
sion. A rigorous external review of these policies can only help
restore conﬁdence and mend damaged relationships. Ifa review
were to impose blatantly mendacious activities, then those re-
sponsible can be held accountable and justice served. Ifnot, the
review can serve to exonerate those accused and restore a sense
of legitimacy and crust to both Student Affairs and die campus
atlaige.
