War on Terror exploits imagery of helpless veiled women

War, cont. from p. 8

In their exploitation of images of help

the Us. government and media use, the same
rhetoric islamic fundamentalists use to 0p
press women.

Both position women as symbols of na-
tional sovereignty. Islamic
fundamentalists use im-
ages of veiled women to
fabricate a myth of na-
tional culture that resists
imperialism.

The us. exploits ims
ages of veiled women as
evidence that a country is
incapable of governing itself.

The propaganda of the “War on Terror"
insists that Muslim Women cry out for liberas

countries are invaded and occupied by the
United States

fundamentalism and western imperialism.
Both forces endeavor to deprive them of the
freedom of selfsdetcrmination and choice.

Just a few weeks ago, Bush deployed {in-
dersecretary of State Karen Hughes to the
Middle East to meet wrth groups ofwomcn
in order to improve the United states'image.

When Hughes tried to tell Saudi women
at Dar Al-Hekma college they were op-
pressed becausc they could not drive, the
women replied that they
would not choose to live
like Americans.‘

For many women
around the world, driVs
ing and painting nails are
not issues of concern and
should not be considered
an international barometer
of women's freedom.

The message to Hughes and to women
of the United States was that they needed
to listen to the concerns of women in Mid
dle Eastern countries rather than imposing
American values.

Women all over the world suffer gender—
based oppression but as Feray salman told

Hughes in Turkey, We can never, ever export
democracy and freedom from one country to
another.”

invasion has not improved the situation
of women. In fact, in many cases, Western
invasion or the threat ofit has worsened con-
ditions for women. in war—torn regions ortoe
day's lraq, women report it is often dangerous
for them to leave their homes to do things
they did without a second thought before
U.S. invasion.

A Baghdad scholar,
Amal Arkhaderi, said ops
pression of women came
with invasion: “This is Iraq
since the wars. This Ira
where women are covered,
stay inside, do not speak
their mind, this is not Iraq,
not the real lraq.“

Middle Eastern feminist response against
Hughes demonstrates women are tired ofbes
ing exploited as symbols to justify invasion,
then victimized by war.

People in the United States who care
about women's rights must not be tricked
into believing in the Bush administration‘s

politically and economically expedient idea
ofwomen's ‘liberation.’

Where were the images of ‘poor veiled
women’ when the us. supported Saddam
Hussein during the iran/iraq war? What
about whcn the us. supported the Taliban in
Afghanistan against Russia?

Conservatives opposed to extra-marital
sex and birth control would never liken them—
selves to the promiscuous American women

in Hollywood movies, nor
would they characterize
American women as cons
stantiy eager for sex.

So why do ofhcials of
the Bush administration
insist on portraying Iraqi
and Afghani women as ea
ger for ‘liberation’ from 'the
veil?

Looking beyond petty politics

Student calls on campus community to address poverty, war and other issues that extend beyond Grinnell bubble

List One: Winter Coat Drive, Red Cross Hurricane Re~
lief, Backpack drive, tuition raises, the coca-cola boycott, and
Giiiiiiell School Board Elections. List Two: Poverty in the US,
obvious R1cism magniﬁed by Hurricane Katrina, Debt Relief,
the War in Afghanistan the “lat in Iraq, Harriet Mieiss pa-
thetic supreme corirt nomination, Guantanamo Bay detainees,
AND MORE.

If you had not figmred it out yet, the
first list is servrce and social actions that are
prevalent on campus. However, there is a
second key difference between the two lists:
the first contains wellspublicized, inoffens
sive, “popular” activities that are easy to get
students to participate in while the second
list is made up of ongoing, internationallyssignificant issues
that affect a much larger number ofpeoplc.

Many ofthe activities in the first list have taken up the time
ofdevoted students, but, in coming to Grinnell, this is not what
I was hoping for not what I expected. There are more impor-
tant things going on in the world that need our attention and
if we are to consider ourselves a socially responsible campus,
ignoring all of the items on the second list makes that impose
sible.

I should like to clarify that I do not object to any of the ac-
tions in list one. They are important and to completely ignore
them would be a mistake; however, to ignore all of the issues on
ListTwo is far more irresponsible.

Is an houra week too mirth to ask
to keep the Iraq war on the minds of
the widerannne/l (ammonia/.7

Since coming to Grinnell,l have signed the Cocu»Cola
boycott, attended the trustees presentation on the Strategic
Plan, donated to Hurricane relief and I would have registered
for the school board election had I not been seventeen at the
time of the vote.

on top ofrhis,i have made an effort to be a regular arrender

of the weekly Peace Walk held every Thurs-
'day at noon, starting at
Herrick Chapel (we're
the ones standing there
when everyone is leav-
ing Convocation). The
group has been doing
this for weeks on end,yet
the most people they have ever had attend is
tourtcen. Have people forgotten about rhc war in iraq>

I was under the impressron that there were more than six or
seven students (the rest of the group is faculty or community
members) who were against the war. is an hom- .i week too
ruuch to ask to keep the Iraq war on the minds of the wider
Grinnell community (which will probably have taken 2000
American soldiers lives and many many more innocent Iraqi
lives by the time this hits press)?

Even ifonc does not support this type ofa protest or wishes
to tackle another issue (I find the forgotten 7 and still un~
charged — prisoners of Guantanamo Bay an especially moving
one), why are there not being more actions organizcd on these

pertinent issues?

Now, I acknowledge that i am only a first year, but 1 don't
think that is an excuse for my ignorance toward the current
political action on campus. ifi am missing something, 1 would
love to be told of it (roortor/r@grrtmall.Mil if you wish). I made
the decision to not sign up for any or the action groups at clubs
rush. I thought I would wait to see what
groups were doing and then join the one
or two that I thought were most important.
other than the peace walk,l have yet to find
any ofthese groups. 1300 students, I admit,
cannot change the entire world. There are
far too many problems to alleviate them all,
but to notdo something about at least one or
two important issues is irresponsible.

It is easy to donate to the charity ofthe day or to organize
students to work toward the hot social topic of the week, but
I struggle to believe that these are tnily the problems that are
most important in our society. In the long run, they probably
lire not even the issues that effect us most.

A quick look outside otGrinnell will expose far worse prob-
lems and these are the ones that require our attention 7 not
the globally inconsequential ones that seem to be the promis
nent issues on our campus. instead ofberng a campus ofBonos
and centrist, Clinton-Bush-backers, let us work toward issues
that truly need solving.

Thanks Grinnell »

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds. In

complaining in ’

a public forum
is always more
fun that doing it
alone.

To the liberator of my bike seat:

I now realize that my vanity in displaying my bi-
cycle seat outside of my donnson my bicycle, no less—
is what caused you to take it.

Thank you for showing me the error ofmy ways.

I feel genuine remorse for this blatant act of cm-
elty to Grinnell students, and I am gladthat you have

‘ remoyed my bicycle seat, in order to facilitate more

kindness in my actions] hope that you continue your
work in the name of what is good and just

Spice up the Sports coverage

Every week the S558 contains a slew of articles
regarding Grinnell College athletics, and while these
write ups have the potenti ii to be totally awesome, thus
far theyve been more like BORL- -op hy 1.1.

So the coach thought the team played hard and dis-
played good teamwork? Thats sweet, but nobody gives
two shits. Coaches should only be quoted if they curse
or say disparaging things about the opposing tearn.The
key to generating interesting sports coverage is to quote
the PLAYERS. For example, I'd be curious to hear how
Gideon Erkensrvick doped with the fact that he couldn’t
see over me grass during last week's soccer game. Also,
be sure to quote Coop from the PEC cage a lot. And
would it kill you to throw in a couple of “BOO-YA!”s?

Truly, a brilliant act of scheduling. Who ms
the genius who thought “Hey, lets have midsseines-
rer exams happen at the same time as Yom Kippur
AND Ramadanl"Yeah, that s only a good chunk of
the Grinnell student population who starved while ,
trying to write papers on coefﬁcients, the role of the
human psyche in status suppression and who airs I
thored what sonnet. Our minds were drowned out
by the grumbling in our stomachs. And for that,l
thank you. And by “thank"l urea ell, something
that doesn't belong in a family newspaper. '
