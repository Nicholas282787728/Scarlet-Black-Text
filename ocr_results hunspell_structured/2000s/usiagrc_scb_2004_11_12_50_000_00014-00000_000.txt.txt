In the first Convocation of the year,
President Osgood spoke about the Grutter
case along with other court cases highlights
ing recent developments in diversity and
free speech on college campuses. Brad’s arr
guinents ignore the information presented
at that Convo, Perhaps he also missed the
panel on diversity featuring administrators,
faculty and students organized by CBS in
October which explained faculty hiring pol-
icies in accordance with Grinnell’s diversity
goals very effectively. Brad's obvious miss
conceptions about hiring policy could not
persist after the panel’s discussion.

Brad writes, “ifI don't act as an active
tourist of race identity [that doesn't mean]
I’m ignorant. It’s simply not something I'm
particularly interested in.”I would say ifyou
haven’t tried to learn about race because its
something you're not particularly interested
in, that demarcates a lack of knowledge
about race that could also be called ign0e
rance, Regardless ofwhat you call it, given
this admission, why would you be in any sort
ofposition to make an argument about the
role of race in diversity Socioeconomic
class, gender, religion, sexuality and national
origin are also important factors to consider
when promoting diversity. Of course, each
of these variables intersects With race as a
social experience. Therefore, race cannot
be downplayed with statements like, “We
all get fucked, some get luckier than 0th
ers—the world's by no means fair so unless
racism is truly oppressive...my sympathy for
you and rage towards the idiot causing the
problem.,,but don’t choose my profs on it,
eh)" Qiestioning the significance of rate
ism in this way involves a high degree of
ignorance, and clearly demonstrates white
privilege

There are several bettcr‘ ways to edur
cate yourself about an issue than posting a
polemic on Plans and soliciting responses.
Brad asks‘ “Why the hell are we so focused
on ‘diversity'? Does it make sense to hire
a lessrqualificd
applicant based
on race, though.>
Among other
things, why in
God’snameshould
we be hiring lcss
competent faculty
because they're
tirsativtinraged.>
Since when does
racc=tiivci-sity.>"
These are rhcr
torical questions.
While you have
the right to post your opinions on a public
forumlikePlans,whcnn ingiuargiimcnt
you have the respoiis iiity of informing
yourself first. After seeking out responses
from minority students, what purpose is
served by declaring, “As to the comfort and
retention of minority studentsmgotla say I
just don't care"?

The exchanges I‘ve had with Brad after
his initial Plan post on Nov. 2nd mark some
of the most frustrating encounters with ig-
norance and prejudice l've ever had. i ran
into Brad on Nov. 3rd outside of Quad and
asked him if he wanted to get together at
some point, because we seemed to have a lot
of things to say to each other. He refused
to meerwith me in pcrson,but continued to
dirt t plan posts to me, at one point persorr
ally insulting me. These are not the actions
of someone genuinely trying to understand
more about an issue.

self of this. When he chooses to do so, it
will be possible to engage in a construcr

diversity that his recent actions suggest he

shocked me—I really didn't think I’d see
such uninformed, offensive words coming
from a student fortunate enough to attend
Grinnell. ,

Parking, pavement
poses problems

imagine Mac field covered with paves
incnt, That is what we would have if we
transferred all of Grinncll's parking lots to
one place. In the Oct. 8th, 2004 SEE, rec
porters Brad Bishop and
Katy Alexander wrote
about parking on Grinncll's
campus. Focused on other
issues, they paid scant ate
rention to the environmen—
tal impacts of parking lots.
We hope that this column
fills in that gap,

First of all — a bit about
our bias. Many of us have
cars. We park on campus. Like many others
in the campus community, we personally une
derstand the demand for parking. However,
when the college considers expanding the
available parking on campus, it's important
to think about the environmental impact of
additional parking spaces.

At the broadest level additional parking
encourages more cars on campus. Certainly,
we appreciate that there are students, face
ulty, and staff who, for one reason of ans
other, would not be able to get to Grinnell
Without a car, And, wc also understand that
the mobility provided by a car is very value
able. Having said that, we also know that
cars harm the environment. The more we
drive, the more we pollute the atmosphere
wrrh greenhouse gasses which contribute to
global warming Having additional parking
on campus reduces the incentive to consider
environmentally friendly alternatives to cars
such as carpooling, shurrlc busses, walking.
and biking in warm weather. We are not
suggesting that we would like to see a dras~
tic reduction in parking on campus. Rather,
we feel that. past a certain point, additional
parking lots may encourage tlrrving rather
than solely meet the basic needs ofthe cam-
pus community.

On a more direct lcvcl, parking lors rcr
does the open space on campus. Mr. Bishop
and Ms. Alexander raised this point in their
article, It is a problem which deserves a
more detailed discussion,

First of all, more parking mcans less
green space. This is more than it problem
of an aesthetic eye-sore. Green space pro-
vidcs habitat for plants and aniin. as well
as space ror the campus community to ens
joy the Grmnell environment. The value
of green space is hard to quantify, but it is
something that should not be forgotten.

Secondly, pavement brings problems.
The largest of these problems is storm was
ter runroff. During a rain storm. water that
hits the soil, is absorbed into the ground, fed
into the water cycle, and causes little prob-
lcm. Water that hits asphalt or concrete
. both impervious surfaces . usually causes
environmental damage. Channeled by guts
ters, cirrbs, and sewers, Grinnell’s stormwae
tcr scoops up sediment, trash, and chemi-
cal pollutants as it rushes along pavement.
In the end, these in an rivcrs deposit their
gunk and poison into Arbor Lake, ponds
by the golf course, and a creek cast of town.
These influxes of undesirable nutrients,
sediment, and chemicals destroy aquatic
life, clog waterways and make it unhealthy
to swim or eat fish from these areas,

There are ways of mitigating the storm
water i iin-offproblcrn. \’\’c would like to see

lots.

Greenhouse gases and
storm water runoff
are two prominent
environmental
problems exacerbated
by additional parking

the College explore some of these options
on a piloteprojcct basis. One way to alien
viate the problem of storm water is to use
pervrous pavements that allow rainwater to
reach soil. While these surfaces may require
a little more maintenance, some ofthe pav-
ing technologies have been tested in cold
climates and they are worth exploring on
campus. Another way to reduce the impact
of stormwater run-off is to catch the water
before it gets too far from the parking lot
7 a method known as bioeretention. This
involves landscaping parking lots so that
storm water is directed to a specific vegr
etated area that receives water and filters
out sediment and some pollutants by acting
like a natural sieve. Both these methods of
addressing storm water could be tested on
current or new parking lots to see how well
they work for the College.
Greenhouse gases and storm water runs
off are two prominent environmental prob
lems exacerbated by addir
tional parking lots. Their
impacts are mostly hidden
from our daily lives, but
they accumulate and have
an effect. Envrronmental
impacts certainly aren't the
only issues when consider
ing parking lots on cam,
pus. But, they shouldn‘t
be a sidernote either,

Election board
practices answered

Last week's article entitled “SGA clot
tion board practices questioned" contained
many insinuations and faulty accusations.
We felt that this piece undermincd the IHT
tegtity ofthe members ofelection board and
did not give a full description of events and
decisions, We felt it necessary to respond to
these allegations.

The e—marl sent by the
r-cprcsentarivc of Bruce
Barnum and the subsu
quent grievance C’ll’iillled
two hours and 38 minutes
after the grievance dead-
linc presented election
board with a conundrum'
which time applies to the
grievance, 11:50 pm or 2:38 am) Election
board convencd at 7:00 pm on Sunday,
Oct, 31 to discuss the two cm ils.

The first email to be discussed was that
sent at 11:51 p.m. The gist of the email
was that .r representative of Bruce barman
wished to filc a grievance and had a paper
copy orthat gricvnncc in hand,

He said that he was dropping the is tie
for the evening and would contact ele tion
board in the morning, However, the rep
rescntativc failed to leave the paper copy
in the Administrative Coordinator's office
or in the AC mailbox, choosing instead to
leave the ofﬁces without filing the grieve
ance.

Election board’s first task was to decide
the merit ofthc email and whether the first
email itself counted as a grievance. If it
did, we would have recognized the filing of
a grievance as well as the later email as a
clariﬁcation ofthe initial grievance.

However, after carefully reading the
applicable Constitutional bylaws and 45
minutes of debating their relation to this
case, election board voted unanimously that
the small scnt at 11:51 did not constitute
‘il grievancc; ir mercly informed clcction
board ofthe intent to file a grievance. Furs
therrnorc, there welc four avenues through

fi']he representative
failed to leave the
paper copy in the
Administrative
Coordinator’s office or
in the AC mailbox.

November 12 2004

which to file a grievance:

l) Personally handing a copy to the Ads
ministrative Coordinator

2) Leaving a copy in the AC mailbox in
the SGA offices

3) Leaving a copy in the AC office

4) Emailing a copy to the [election]
email account.

Failure to leave the paper copy in the
mailbox or office, email an electronic copy
of the grievance, or personally hand the
grievance to the AC by midnight meant
that the first copy of the grievance was filed
at 2:38am, after the deadline had passed.

The most troubling insinuation of last
week's article was that concerning apparent
corruption ofelection board. We would like
to point out that, as stated in that article,
“No students interviewed for [SGA election
board practices questioned] said that there
was any specific corruption in the special
election."

Furthermore, OCCO senator Jacob
Cram was given an opportunity to clarify his
remarks i that article. Given this chance,
Cram pointed out “I was not directly accuse
mg election board ofcotruptlon”and agreed
that the framing of his quotation “might
not have been fair.”

Regarding the selection of board meme
bers and a supposed bias for the SGA cabir
net candidate, personal vote or candidate
preference played no part in our decision.
In fact, an informal poll of election board
after the grievance matter had bcen settled
showed that in the runoff election a major
ity of election board voted for Bruce, not
Rebecca,

As for the composition of election board,
AC Mike Maloney used a list given to him
by former AC Andy Grimm, contacted
those students, and added additional stu-
dents who expressed an interest. Further
more, when asked about the composition of
this year’s election board to those in years
past, Grimm said, “Election Board, in my
experience with SGA and my knowledge
of its recent history before that was never
approved by Joint Board . . .This year was
definitely more procedural than before." In
short, Election Board was not biased toward
the SGA cabinet candidate.

We would like to take this opportunity
to stress that we understood the importance
ofrliis election and treated
the grievance matter with
the respect and consider-
ation it deserved. We Llrk
derstand that Bruce might
feel that his grievance was
thrown out on “techni-
calities" b t without such
technicali es the rules be
come meaningless.

We understand that some students may
disagree with our dcc. n, but we want to
emphasize that each dccrsron made rcgarde
ing the emails was made by consensus of
election board and made wirh strict regard
for the son constitution and its bylaws.

As we have nothing to hide, WC welcome
any further questions students or reporters
might have regarding our thought proce so
cs; feel free to contact [election] wirh these
questions.

In addition, we would like to encourage
any interested StutlenteAteLarge to join
election board for the upcoming initiatives;
we welcome anyone with the time and dedi-
cation to run this clcction.

Initiative voting is being hcld on Friday.
Nov. 19th. Please submit your name to
[election] by 5:00 pm. Tuesday, Nov, 15 to
bi: added to the board.
