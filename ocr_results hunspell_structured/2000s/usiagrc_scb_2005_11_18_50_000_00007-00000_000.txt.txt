TIM Prime/ml Review lists Grinnell
as a college where "students ignore
God on a regular basis” (Princeton
Review Website, “Grinnell College.”

11/14/05). This alleged penchant for
secularism worried Brad Bishop ’08. “I
thought, knowing Grinnell's reputa-
tion, it’d be me and three or four other
Christians hiding in the woodwork,
poking their heads out at Christmas
and Easter," he said. Upon arrival,
Bishop soon joined the Grinnell Coir
lege Christian Fellowship (GCCF),
an organization he now cesleads. The
GCCF offers bible study 16 times
per week. “When someone comes to
Grinnell, they can be as active or as his
active in their religious life as they want
to be,"Bishop said. “The opportunities
are there."

The campus boasts 15 different res
ligious groups, representing seven difs
fetent world religions. “1 think many
people feel that by calling it a secular
campus it may feel more inclusive,"
Chaplain Deanna Shorb said, "But as
far as [being] a secular campus, no, it
isn’t."

Kholoud Hassan ’06 is less certain.
“[My] general feeling on campus is
‘Am I the only one who knows there’s
something called religion?" she said.
As one of the leaders of the Muslim
Students Association (MSA), Hassan
has struggled with the lack ofMuslim
community on campus. With only three
members, including Hassan, the MSA
relies on the Chaplains Ofﬁce for rides
to Cedar Rapids to get to the nearest
mosque. Rather than relying entirely
on those services,Hassan found her res
ligious community in the weekly meets

straughan arrived at Grinnell last
year hoping to and a forum where she
could explore her spiriniality and search
for a religion to suit her beliefs. “Col-
lege was going to be my time to sort out
my spirituality," she said. Instead, she
only found student groups for spectﬁc
religions. She was motivated to start
(3le to help others explore their faith
with her.

“There are not enough places to talk
about our experiences," said Straughan.
She sees religious exploration as an inn
portant step against
“blind acceptance."
In GIRS, members
share aspects of their
own religions up-
bringings and beliefs
and invite other stun
dents to explain new
religious concepts.

some who ﬁnd campus religious
groups insufficient go into town. Em-
ily Wax '09 began attending St. Mary's
Church, a traditional Catholic church,
to remind her ofhome and ﬁght homes
sickness. There she di overed an op-
portunity to teach religious education
to local children. Wax prefers this off
campus religious option because “it
keeps me from being too much of a
selfscentered college student. "Now she,
along with several others in her hall, at-
tend the church roughly every other
week. In Shorb’s estimation, there are
about 20 different Christian churches
in town, all available for students.

Bob Cadmus, Physics, has also
melded the religious life of the college
and town. Cadmus and his wife origi-

nally hcld silcnt Quaker meetings in
their living room but have since moved
on campus. He said the group con,
sistcd of students, faculty and members
of town, though the number of stu-
dent participants fluctuates the most.
The group also helps organize Grins
ncll’s weekly peace marches, which
leave from Herrick Chapel at noon on
Thursdays.

When Elena Goodrich ’07 arrived
at Grinnell, she hoped to get away
from religion. After taking a semester
off, the current Religious Studies major
returned with a more profound faith
in Buddhism. Upon discovering that
Grinnell did not have Buddhist group,
Goodrich began organ ing her own.

This organiza-
tional lole has not
come easily. “It‘s ins
terestmg and fis
trating as a group
leader because last
year we had a strugr

lc with the attens
dance rate," said oodrich. “This year
only four to six people come [to the
Buddhist group], yet there are over 60
people on the email list. I wonder why
people are hesitant, Does it not interest
them? Do they not have enough time?
Is it a low priority?"

Increasing a group's publicity,
through posters or other advertising,
presents one potential remedy for the
lack of participation, but students do
not want to be perceived as evangeliZs
ing. “1 am wary about proselytizing to
people on campus,” Goodrich said.
“I have to rely on the assumption that
if people want to be involved, they can
stop by the religious office or look on
the website."

Chaluretm, Grianells Jewish or-

ganization, has also confronted par
ticipation problems, Deborah Kaiser
'08, one of the group's leaders, said she
has hesitated to publicize events, due
to the same fears as Goodrich, leading
to less participation in religious activr
ties. Although the group offers many
types or activities, according to Kaiser,
“We don't get people for the religious
[events] but more for the cultural, fun
stuff.” She said that although there is
relatively low turnout for religious ser—
vices, the weekly Shabbat meals are al-
ways “alive and flourishing."

Others are not so worricd about
turning students off. Bishop supports
advertising to increase participation in
GCCF, in part because he thinks there
are many potential members Bishop
said that when the Chaplain's office
sent out its service cards, over half of
all students identified with some form
of Christianity. Bishop, concerned that
without publicity students might be left
out, hung up ﬂiers for GCCF, though
not without consequences. "At the start
orthe year, we had poster campaigns for
N50," Bishop said. “Then later I read
a quote on Plans that said, ‘Where did
all these Christians come from,I came
to get away."

Goodrich agreed that the atmo-
sphere on campus is not always faiths
friendly. “In a place highly intellecnial
like Grinnell, religion, particularly the
notion of belief in faith, is commonly
perceived as irrational."

While relieved to discover a Chris
tian community at Grinnell, Bishop
was unsure how to describe the gen-
eral sense of spiritual Life on campus.
“There’s no good word to characterize
Grinnell," he said. “Religious [and secus
lar] don't apply but you are very free
to explore and the resources are here."

Asian-American Students explore identity

Minority?

How do you feel about
the sterotype ofAsian-
Americans as the "model
minority")

- “Upon ﬁrst glance, it
seemed like a ﬂattering
comment, however, it
creates an unnecessary
distinction amongst
other races,a sense of
entitlement, and also
a sense ol obligation
to an ideal that seems
rather ambiguous."
ilawrence Sumulong
'09

-“On one hand it
has allowed Asian
Americans to move
more swiltly up the
social saws ladder in
comparison to other
minority groups. Nev-
ertheless, it also sets
an unforgiving standard
for those who do not
meet the expectations
of the math whiz all-

“Asians are small and not very
athletic," said Shyuah Yang '08. “At
least that's how the stereotype goes,"
he added. Yet it was on the basketball
court last fall that Yang met Mike Tran
'08. They would later lead the Asian
American Coalition (AAC), a student
group with a current mailing list ofover
seventy people.

AAC was formed last semester by
Tran, Diana PhungsVuong '07 and
Danny Marks '05. They, and other sni-
dcnts, did not feel as if their concerns
were being adequately addressed in
Asian Students In Alliance (ASIA)
and decided to start a group rociised
entirely on the Asian-American expe
rience. “We decided to form a Coalition
speciﬁcally based on AsiansAmcrlcan
issues," said Tran, who is president of
AAC.

The split from ASIA was not witlr
out friction. “When we were first forms
ing there was some controversy,” Vice
President Yang said. “But we stress difs
fetent things and by no means are we
competing."

AsiansAmerican students continue
to be a part ofASlA and, according to
Tran, “give them full support." Each
group is advised by Don Inthulangsy, a
multicultural counselor at Student Af-
fairs. “Both groups work exceptionally
well with each other," she said.

Exploring identity remains a key
component of the work of both groups.
“We don’t want to identify ourselves as
half of a particular Asian descent and

half American, but rather as a whole
social group,"Tran said,“We're not half
ofanything,"

AAC thiew a movie study break on
Nov. 9, screening “Banana Split."They
also co-sponsorcd a visit on Wednesday
by Chicagosbased artist Laura Joni,
whose work focuses on identity ASIA
is planning an event on Nov. 19 called
“My Big Fat Asian Wedding." Students
will engage in typical wedding tradi-
tions from their culture at the Forum
North Lounge.

Thc two events demonstrate the
contrasting purposes of each group.
ASIA social coordinator sangar Sainju
’08 said, “ASIA works informally to
educate Grinncll about Asian culture."
For members of ASIA, maintaining
culniral tiaditions is a higher priority
than exploring how American idcntity
interacts with Asian traditions.

“We don't have this confusion about
where we came from,” said Sainju, ac-
knowledging that his statement might
be a generalization ofAsiilnsAmerican
students.

For international students from
Asia, adaptation to American culture is
a more frequent issue than expression
or adoption ofAmeriean culture.

Sainju said,“[Asian—Americans] are .

confused about [with] which culture
to conform. For most of us, it’s easier
because we've just been raised in one
community.”

Members of ASIA often do not
confront issues of identity but of cul-
ture shock upon arriving in Grinnell,

“When I ﬁrst came here, I felt pretty
odd to be exposed to the liberal Ameris
can culture," he said.ManyASIA meme
bets belong to ISO, whereas members
ofAAC generally do not.

According to the Office of Diversity,
76 AsiansAmerican students attended
Grinnell in the 200472005 school year.
In the same year, 94 students from Asia
attended Grinnell.

Inthalangsy stressed the different
needs or both groups. “AsiansAmeris
cans have a whole diiterent expeiience
[than that orAsiaiisl," she said. “There
is a large difference between the expo

rience of a first generation immigrant
who is adjusting to a new language and
culture, and a fifth generationJapaneses
American who feels Americanized but
is still an outsider because of the way
they look."

Yang once joked that Tran “looks
Asian, but he's not really, he’s Ameri—
can." Tran laughed and replied, “You
may be born looking one way, but then
you experience so many things that
change you."

Jason Chen '07, an ASIA cabinet
member, noted, “Asian identity is not
determined by what you look like bllt
rather based on thc way you act."
