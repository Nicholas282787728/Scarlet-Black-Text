Lara Rosen ’04 was this year’s recipient of SGA’s
BRANDON MARTINEZ AWARD. The award was presented
to Rosen at this week’s Joint Board for her work on the
Concerts Committee. The award is given eveiy year to
one student showing exceptional commitment to SGA
in an non-elected or appointed position. . , . Some East
Campus dorms will remain unnamed next semester. There
has been a lack of exceptionally large donations to
warrant an ofﬁcial placard. The Cost of getting a dorm
name is estimated to be $1.5 million. . . . The Trustees
in their visit to campus emphasized the necessity of
referring to the new campus center as the JOE
ROSENFIELD CAMPUS CENTER, It was pointed out that
Rosenﬁeld’s estate gave 325 million for the campus
center. ”When you put up that much money you deserve
to have [the center] called afteryou," said SGA VP Devan
McGranahan. . . . Over 638 students donated a meal to
this semesters FOG-FAST. However, many ofthose meals
will not translate to cash for the Ethiopian AIDS charity
and the Grinnell Community Meal. There were some
problems with students donating meals they didn’t have
left, and those without meal plans trying to donate
meals. "But 538 students wanted to donate their meals,
and that’s what mattered,” said Student Services
Coordinator Christina Doxsie ’03 SGA and the Grinnell
Renaissance community development organization will
offer FREE ICE CREAM AND LIVE MUSIC this Saturday
from 1-3 in Central Park. There will be free ice cream
and live music. The rain location is Saint’s Rest
coffeehouse, across the street. Both Saint's Rest and
the Grinnell Coifee Company on Main Street will offer
live music that evening.
