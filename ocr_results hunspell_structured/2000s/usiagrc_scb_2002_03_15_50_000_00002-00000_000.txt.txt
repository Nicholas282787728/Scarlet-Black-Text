Ames concedes;

by E ri k G a b l e
Staff Writer

The clccrion for Vice presidcnr/presidenr of academic affairs was rc-
solvcd without a second runoff when I’aul Arms ’04 conceded to Devan
McGIanal-mn ’04, who led by 128 votes in riie ﬁrst round ofvoiing on
Wednesday, Marci. 6.

Arm: said he was fairly ccrrain, based on die msulrs of die ﬁrst elecv
tion, that McGranahan would win the runoff. Although he was on rhe
ballot for me first mnofron Friday, he oprcd ro drop our before Tuesday’s
second anempr.

The vote spread bciwccn McGranahan and Ames in the ﬁrst round
was actually scvcn votcs smaller rirrn the difference between Alejandro
Oyanabal '04 and Katie
Piepcr '05, who won me
largestnumbcrofvotcsin
riic ﬁrst election for presi-
dent,

Ames was ill at rho
rime, an additional factor
in his decision to concede
rhc race.

Amm said he had faith
in ills former opponenr’s
ability ro perform the job
of vice president, “lfl
hadn't had conﬁdence in
die person i was running against, man I would have ronrrnurd," he said.
“Eur I believe he will do a good job."

The candidates agreed on most topics, except for McGranaiian’s pro»
posal ro expand the mentoring program currently in pirce in the science
division in the humanities and social sciences, Ames said he felt the deci-
slon abour whether ro implement a mentoring program should rest nirii
individual department Student Educarional Policy Commirrccs (SEPCs).

McGranalian said be planned ro talk to people abour the mentoring
program before putting ford-i any Speciﬁc proposals. Working on Mentored
Advanced Projects (MAP5) and an experiment in Mentored lniroctuctory
Projects would be among his First priorinac in ofﬁce, Mccmnaiian said,

McGi-dnahan praised Ames for his courage in conceding rbe elecrion
wiihoui knowing rh: results of Friday’s invalidated runoff. “l rhink ir rook
a lot ofgucs, and I really appreciated ir," he said. “I’d like ro dunk rharl
would have done rhc same rlung rliar he did. "

Interim Election Board chair Brandon Zicha '02, one ofrhrcc people
who was officially supposed ro know the results of the voided runoff,
would nor comment on the exact vorc rorals. He did, however, say that he
“wouldn't allow any candidate to do anything riiar would counter (he will
of die studcnrs."

"I think [conceding] took a
lot of guts, and I really
appreciated it. I'd like to
think that I would have
dome the same thing that
[Paul Ames ‘04] did,”
—Devan McGronohan ’04

woman. Oyambal called our scenario “very likely."

Early Thursday morning, a dbrppoinred Piepcr cx»
pressed frusrmrion wrrii riic way shesaid many people mix»
interpreted her campaign,

“I feel like I might as well have written my statement
ofinronr in hieroglyphics, because a significant number of
people on rhis campus have lntcrprcted it based on what
they wanted to hear," she said. “And it's a shame that im»
pressions and rumorr carry more weight rbrn substance

She added, “I feel :r leasr, ifnorliing else. I made this
