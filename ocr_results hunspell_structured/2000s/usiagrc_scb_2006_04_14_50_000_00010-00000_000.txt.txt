Staff editorial
perplexes prof.

I would like to thank the S65}? for its thoughtful exploration of help me understand. I had the notion that proper instruction in a

the proper curriculum for a 21st century liberal education in last
week's editorial. 1 am particularly grateful for the
illuminating comments on the English and for
eign language departments. My colleagues in the
foreign languages have operated under the im—
pression that we foreground communicative skills
over grammar—centered pedagogies.

Your well-researched and responsible opinion
piece makes it abundantly clear, though, that we
have not gone far enough in eliminating grammar
instruction from our cout‘ses.Whom needs grams
mar, after all.> And Literature? No one reads books
anymore. Let’s watch more TV.

1 am perplexed on one matter that the editors could perhaps

pedagogic;

My collegues in the foreign
language department have
operated under the impression
that we foreground communicative
skills over grammarstentered

foreign language that includes grammatical accuracy might be one
ofthe more practical elements in a Grinncll Colo
lege education.

Similarly, I assumed that the cultural com—
petency one gains from an encounter with other
cultures’ literatures might be of practical value,
even if that is not the only beneﬁt. I was clearly
wrong. 1 shall try to convince my colleagues to
retool. Rather than teach courses on African-
American literature, French civilization, Spanish
colonial legacies, Russian culture and the like,
we should offer courses such as “Grammar-Free
Business German."

Party parodies stereotype

Thugs Life party intended to poke fun at pop culture, not perpetuate prejudice

in “Living in a Gangstas Paradise" which was printed in Tbr
Sci/ad, the author is disturbed that a white male Grinnell student
would make a poster with himself dressed as a gangster, inviting
students to a party called "Thug Life, chpin’ it
Gangsta."

Throughout the article, we are never sure
whether the author believes it is possible to sepa-
rate black culture from pop culture, Rap is not
black culture, which is why Method Man does
not represent Malcolm X.

Pop culture does not create a positive im-
age of blacks through rap. In fact, rap reinforces
negative stereotypes, but rap is only racist if you
use it to represent more than pop culture, and
generalizing all rap as racist is equally ignorant
(see Talib Kweli).

The idea behind the Thug Life party is to be a parody ofa pare
ody. I can understand why this would be disturbing to some people,
because there is no way to determine that the motivcs of the par-

equally/ignorant.

in fact, rap reinforces negative
stereotypes, out rap IS only
racist of you use it to represent
more than pop culture and
generalizing all rap as racist l5

ticipants are pure.

I felt the party had a respectful festival atmosphere with a D], rin
diculous chains and a lot of toy guns with sound effects.The funni-
est part as I recall was a particular prospie from the
suburbs ofChicago who genuinely believed that he
was gangster. He kept on shouting “630” and talking
about how we did not know how ghetto he ims.

Racism festers in places that we do not reﬂect
on, and so I respect the author of“Livin in a Gangs
slas Paradise."YetI can not pretend that the success
of groups like Threees Mafia and their racist, sexist
and materialistic views are not a symptom of the ab—
surdity our pop culture. Therefore, 1 must question
the author’s expectation for everyone to ignore these
ever-present images of rap.

Pop culture is such a powerful tool in our global society. Somen
times, people need to openly mock and defy the system so that they
are not incorporated.

Reconsider racy ads

one ofthese days,you're gonna see me walking down the South
Campus loggia, and I’m going to utter a yelp of surprise. “Hey
Max," you might ask me, “What arc.you yclping about?" And I'll
say to you, ”Reader ofthe stats, 1 just saw a series of posters ad-
vertising a Grinnell women's sports event, and none of the posters
invoked the sexual appeal of the female athletes'bodies as a reason
to attend the event."

When the women’s soccer team wanted to advertise a matchi
they told us to come check out their calves. When the women's
crossncountry team had a big meet, they said to come see the shorts
shorts. When the women's water polo team was looking for specta-
tors, they put up pictures of a female water polo player exposing
another player's breast. 1 could go on.

Before I go on, let me
make a couple of defensive
statements:

1) I am no puritan. I
enjoy calves, breasts and
short-shorts as much as the
next guy.

2) I am not saying that women at this school should be con»
demned for marketing their sexuality. They own it, they can do
with it what they will. Furthermore, I understand that sexuality can
be a means ofempowerment, and that it is patriarchal to say that a
woman marketing her sexuality is necessarily cheapening herself.

3) When I use the phrase “women’s sports teams," as in “A

l am not saying that women at til/5
school should be condemned for
marketing their sexuality

woman’s sports team put up posters of several of their members
naked," I'm referring to whichever pcrsons were involved in the
creation ofthe posters. I understand that the majority of any given
team has nothing to do with these things and probably doesn’t give
a shit either way how an event is advertised.

4) I understand that these posters are not 100 percent serious,
that the women’s water polo team doesn’t really want us to think
that they're gonna pull each

But if these posters are just lnlnk maybe we should give

meant strictly as a joke, I ,
have a hard time figuring {ll/SSWNWUQW-

out why it is made with such
consistency.

5) I don’t want to censor anything; Ijust think maybe we should
give this some thought.

Look, I’m not trying to condemn anyoneThis stuff just makes
me depressed.To me, women's sports seem like a place, maybe the
only place, where women can step out ofthe horrifying, objectify-
ing xeray of the male gaze and be valued for what they can do, not
how they look.

My beef is not with female athletes, but with whatever makes
female athletes feel like they need to advertise a peep show to get
guys to come to a track meet.

Stop typing,
start talking

Grou projects would not get turned in on
time wit out c—mail. Arguments thrive in the
vacuum of Plans. Class participation points den
pend on Blackboard postings. And if Facebook
didn’t allow you to check in on your cmsh, you
would never have known that they were single.

In AIMrspeak, Grinnellians deserve a big :(
for using monitors to screen ourselves from real
conversation.

It should come as no surprise that e—mail is
the lifeblood ofa college that offers wireless ac-
cess anywhere on ————

ness and you have a
recipe for full inboxes
communication.

... and empty conver-
sations.

We are a college
of critical readers
and articulate writers but mediocre speakers.The
colleges mission statement announces its inten~ '
tion to graduate students who speak “persuasively
and even eloquently" However, cam us interac-
tions leave us questioning whether rinneliians’
speaking skills have progressed signiﬁcantly since
NSO.

. All too often, class discussions are awkward
interactions between a few wellrspoken or long-
winded students and a dozen others who either
rarely speak or who stumble to articulate their
thoughts.

campus disagreements rarely result in a
meeting of interested parties to discuss the issues
in hopes of arriving at compromise or under
standing. Instead, most students prefer to tackle
uncomfortable issues by wielding their comput-
ers as shields,

There is nothing inherently wrong with e~
mail or Plans. Email is convenient and gener-
ally accepted as formal enough for most student-
student and student—professor communication.
Plans provides an efficient means ofcommuni—
caring your latest pet peeve or social crusade to
the majority of campus.

Still, there is nothing wrong with faccrttrface
conversation. As we’re sure you have noticed by
now, it has a lot of advantages. Try picking up
on non-verbal cues through Plans. Try giving
someone a hug through e-mail, or making a toast
through a blog. Physical proximity has a tremene
dous amount ofmeaning in communication.

Misunderstnndings arise even more eas-
ily when we neglect facentonface conversations.
Campus debates conducted through Planwars or
e—mail spats run the risk of twisting the writer’s
intentions, causing misconstrued emotions, and
leaving sarcasm undetected. Hours of typing can
be wasted in an argument before discovering that
your ”opponent" actually shares a similar opinion
and lives across the hall.

Sometimes the time constraints inherent in
being a Grinnellian make realrﬁme conversations
impractical. E-mail serves its purpose, and’we
certainly aren’t suggesting we delete our inbosies
and stock up on stamps instead.

After all, this staﬂ' editorial might never have
been written if not for the magic of email. Yet
we also hope our campus will reaffirm its belief
in face—rovﬁtce conversations. if we neglect to de-
velop our speaking skills, we may find ourselves
unpleasantly surprised when we leave the wired
and socially awkward bubble of Grinnell College.
Apparently, the outside world actually expects
you to talk to people.
