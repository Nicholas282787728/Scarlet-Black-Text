Smoking ban strictly enforced

BY Then BANAS

In the past few weeks, a number of ﬁnes
have been allocated to students by police and
campus security who have had been caught
violating the Smokefree Air Iowa Act.

“1 was just the unlucky
one that hadn’t ﬁnished
her cigarette when the bike
cop came up...and he gave
me a fifty dollar fine," Kath
Barbadoro ’10 said.

The act, passed in July
2008, outlaws smoking
in all public workplaces,
including outdoor spaces.
Restaurants, bars, schools
and other businesses are
subject to the ruling. The law was designed to
ensure all employees were working in smoke-
ftec environments.

“The rationale is that people should not be
subjected to working where there is cigarette
smoke," Barbadoro said. "Colleges are in a
very precarious position with this law. They’re
a public place, but they're also a residential,
private space."

Now that the word of the law has htld
time to spread,Iowa state legislature is putting
pressure on local police departments. in turn,
Chief of Grinnell Police Jody Muthcrly has
asked campus security to strictly enforce the
law, which outlaws smoking on all College

Some.”

”It’s been a real burden on the
college, the state and buyness
owners alike. It’s very (umber—

But because smoking on campus has in
past been a largely unrestricted habit, the law
is not easy to be enforced.

“it has been a real burden on the college, the
state and business owners
alike. It’s very cumbersome,”
said Matherly. Matherly
said his squad has been
informed to be especially
persistent in enforcing the
law and have been writing
up tickets all around town,
not just on campus.

Apart from individual
tickets, businesses can
receive hefty ﬁnes for
allowing illegal smoking. "What happened
last year was the state sent their own people
in here," Director otcampus Security Stephen
Briscoc said. “[Thc state inspector] saw some
people smoking."

The school was not ticketed, but it easily
could have been. According to an article from
the Washington Examiner, since the act was
passed, the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division
has taken administrative action against 50
businesses. The division, which has the power
to revoke liquor licenses, has distributed $1000
ﬁnes in addition to sevunedny liquor license
bans to 50 businesses that have violated the
law. According to the Iowa Department of

Public Health, the state has sent notice of
possible violations to approximately 1015
businesses, including retail stores and servtcee
based businesses.

Grinnell College has been very thorough
in its efforts to communicate the rules. In
addition to the mass emails sent out by
Briscoe, signs have been placed in parking
lots and other typical smoking areas. Also, in
accordance with state demand, all cigarette
receptacles have been removed from the
campus premises.

Removing the receptacles has been highly
controversial, Smokers now have no proper
place to dispose of their cigarette butts.
A student smoker, who asked to remain
unnamed, said "I'm going to throw it into the
grass," while another said he would put butts
in trash receptacles. Briscoe recognizes the
dangcr ofthc absence ofcigarettc receptacles.

“They smoldcr in there and start ﬁres,
and we’ve had a number of ﬁres caused by
cigarettes," Briseoe said.

Despite all the action they've been asked
to take, both Briscoe and Chief Matherly
say they do not completely agrcc with the
law. Nevertheless, smokers are left with two
choices—enjoy a cigarette on the sidewalk or

risk the $50 ﬁne

Grinnell, IA

Hate Crime .
Policy released

BV MATT BACIITEH. AND
NADIA HASSAN

on Sept. 23, 2009, the draft of the long-
awaitctl Hate Crimes and BLIS’ll/lollvlﬂed
Incidents Policy was released to the campus

community to solicit feedback. The pro-

tocol was drafted in response to a much
publicized incident in the spring of 2008,
in which 34
members of
the Grinnell
community
received hate
mail through
campus mail.

5 purred
by the reaee
tion of last
year’s SGA
p re s i d e n t
Neo Morake
'09 and the
aﬁce of Student Affairs began drarring the
new policy in conjunction With the Presls
dent's Ofﬁce.

“We wanted to have a policy in place dic-
tilting the minimum standard response by
the community for those kinds nfsituntions,"
said current SGA President Harry Krcjsa.

One of the concerns with the draft was
making a protocol broad cnough to cover all
future incidents ofhate crime.

“This is not just about the spring of
2008," said Vice President for Diversit) and
Achievement Elena Bernal. "The idea is that
we have a clear institutional pathway to re-
spond to a hate crime or a biasemotivated
incident."

The draft of the protocol states “no one
has the right to denigrate another human be
ing on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientas
tion, gender identity and expression, national
origin or other aspects ofidentity.”

The protocol draft deﬁned a hate crime
as “a criminal act that is committed against a
person, group or property there ofbecause of
race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin,
disability. gender and/or sexual orientation."
It provides a list of indicators should stu-
dents feel they are being targeted. The pro~
tocol also differentiates between hate crime
and bias-motivated incidents, explaining that
bias-motivated incidents fall under the pro-
tection of free speech while still conveying
the intent ofhatie.

The protocol emphasizes the need to re
port episodes ofhate crime to the appropriate
departments. It speciﬁes the measures that
will be taken to redress the offense, which
may include ralliesY mediationY facilitated
dialogue or a number of other options listed
in the protocol. The entire campus will be
notiﬁed when a hate crime or biasemotivated
incident occurs, including description of the
incident and the petpetratot(s), and contact
information to report additional events, The
identities orrhe victims will be respected.

“Students, faculty and staﬁ’ need to be
supported lit ‘tl time that there is any kind of
hate or binsemotivated incident on campus,"
Bcrnal said.
