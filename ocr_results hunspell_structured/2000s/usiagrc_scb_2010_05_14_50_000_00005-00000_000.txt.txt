New sound for the last show

BYEMILYBAJET

Next Friday, Chicagfrbased band Blane
Fonda will be performing in Gardner at s
p.m. Having formed little over a year ago
from two other Chicago bands, Blane
Fonda offers an upbeat bur melodramatic
take on a fusion of sounds, melodies and
rhythms that Will arouse the crowd in more
ways than one.

”We all listen to different types ofmue
sic, we all have varied types of inﬂuences,
so finding the common ground and influ-
encing each other to make music is a really
big part of our band,” singer Mark Wentz
said during a phone interview with the
band.

Upon hearing their music, this message
could not be clear enough, as each song
seems to comprise a medley of varying
traits,

Blane Fonda intertwines a collection
of fastepaced rhyrhms, somber tones, and
interesting instrumental compilations that
create one cohesive sound. One essential
element of this band is their lead vocalist,
Mark Wentz, whose voice adjusts to ﬁt the
mood ofeach song’s lyrics.

In addition to Wentz, the reverberations
of Dave Veller’s bass guitar and the other
men’s voices that comprise the band help to
solidify this deeply masculine sound.

In contrast, the instruments of Matt
Witt, keyboard player and trumpeter,
Charlie Nadler, guitarist, and drummer
David Fine all work together to challenge
the heavy melodies.

Whereas the vocals reverberate in the
pit of your stomach, the instruments pro»
vide a reliefby stimulating your outer sens-

es and lifting you our of the moroseness of
the singing. With the collaboration ofthese
various elements comes a surprisingly cohee
me sound that is neither so low key as to
inspire lethargy, but not with such a high
octane as to result in a brain aneurism.

The song “Modern Women" illustrates
this band’s strength nicely, as the grave voice
of Wentz mixes smoothly with the brassy
sound of Witt‘s tiuinpet and produces an
invigorating experience. Wentz said that
there is a therapeutic aspect of their music
because each member ofrhe baud puts their
own passions and frustrations in their songs.

“I write alot about things that are beyond
my control," Wentz said. “It’s therapy really
and I know the other guys feel the same way.
If you can't change something in your life,
or something’s out ofyour control, you can
beat it out on the drums, you can hammer it
out on the bass, or you can wail on it when
your singing, or you can write about some-
thing that's aggravating you, whether it’s sad
or happy."

While Blane Fonda is good, and gene
erates an interesting sound, those looking
for easy-going music will be hard pressed
to find it here. What brings the two con—
trasting effects of heavy vocals and higher
ranged instruments together is the ability of
the musicians to cue each other and produce
one, synthesized sound that is both deeply
resonating and uplifting. When this band
manages to pull it off, the sound is new, ex-
hilarating, and exciting, and when it doesn't,
the sound remains flat and pulls the listener
down, However, even this intense sound can
be stimulating, depending on your mood and
penchant for languor.

This past Saturday prior to waltz, sev—
eral Minneapolis bands played a show in
Gardner for those uninterested in or bored
with waltz pre-parties but still with a little
leftover Alice in their systems. Food Pyra-
mid is an ex erimenial band featuring Chris
Farstad ['095 on the drums. As yet unsigned
to any record label, the band’s music alter—
nates between rhat which one might play at
a rave and excellent study music, depending
on the song selected. Purely instrumental,
the music sounds a little like Explosions in
the Sky mixed with a settled down version of
Crystal Castles (no Alice Glass screeching).

one for the Team also graced Gardner
with their presence on Saturday, offering
Grinnellians a completely different vibe
than that of Food Pyramid. One for the
Team recently released a new album, enti-
tled "Ghosts," off the indie label Afternoon
RecordsiThis album, which reached #83 on
Billboard's New Artists chart, is the band’s
second—the first album was released in Des
ceinber oflast year. One for the Team accue

rately categorizes their music as Indie/Rock/
Powetpop. Qiieter songs such as “Questions
and Panthers," which they played on Saturn
day and hails from their first album, stand in
sharp contrast to the somewhat loudcrLrock
feel of"Ghosts.” One for the Team has been
likened to Matt 8: Kim, Mates of State and
velocity Girl and in some songs, there was
even a little of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs in their
sound. They plan to release another record
this year, according to an article SPIN mag-
azine recently ran on the group,

Gardner was calm at the onset of the
shows, but as the night went on, increasing
numbers of students trickled into the show.
By the second half of One for the Team’s
set, students were headrbobbing and foot-
bouncing all over the dance ﬂoor. Some of
the decorations for the Justice dance parryi
which took place later in the eveningihad
already been set up, so students danced be-
neath black trash bags billowing from the
ceiling. Gardner was deﬁnitely a marked
contrast from softlyelit, jazzy Darby, which
was probably a good thing,
