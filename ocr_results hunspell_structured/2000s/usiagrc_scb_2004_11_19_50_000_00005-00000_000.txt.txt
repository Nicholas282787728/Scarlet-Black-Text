On Saturday, Nov 13, some Grinnell students received word that a
popular website, TheFacebook.com, had been expanded to Griuncll By
midaftemoon on Monday there were already 439 members of this web
site, a service where college students post profiles and form links to other
students.

TheFacebook.com has more than 800,000 members at 256 colleges,
according to Chris Hughes, who identified himself as confoundcr and
“press guy" of Faccbook. By any measure, it has already proven wildly pops
ular at Grinnell.

New online directory provides new online obsession, networking for students

Once a proﬁle has been created, it is fuuy searchable by other students. A
user can request to be considered a “friend” of another. Iftl-ie request is ap
proved, then each student gets a link to their friends profile posted on their
own.Tlic system also displays information such as what students are mutual
friends of two users. Faccbook can cvcn gcncratc a web page that visually
displays a student's “social network“ as an organizational chart,

One of the most interesting features of Facebook is the lists of “friends"
that get compiled. Michael Billups ‘07, whose profile listed as Grinnell stu-
dents as “friends" on Thursday afternoon, said that many of those were people

he didn’t actually know. “I probably know about 40 of them

Some even worry that Facebook, as the website is
commonly referred to, can be dangerous because students
can become obsessed with it. Students were more than
willing to talk about how much time they spent using
Facebook. Topher Elderkin ‘08 characterized his new
habit of checking Facebook as “compulsive.” Other stun
dents used terms such as “addictive” and “obsessed."

According to Hughes, it's no fault of the website if
some students spend too much time using it, “If people

time I check my mail
there’s another re-
quest from someone
to be confirmed as a
friend.“

personally," he said. “It seems that every time I check my mail
there‘s another request from someone to be conﬁrmed as a
friend." Rejecting a friend request is an option, but to Billups,
it seemed “kind ofrude." Other students interviewed, howew
er, had not experienced strangers requesting to be “friends.”
Grinnell is actually something of a latecomer to Face-
book, According to the Facebook website, it was created in
Febuary of this year by Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckcta
berg. After it proved popular at Harvard, he expanded it to

like the website, then they like it, " he said. “Some people
really like movies, but that doesn‘t mean movies shouldn't
be made.”

Facebook, in and of itself, does not offer much that Grinnell students
did not already have access to. A searchable campus directory has long
been available on PionechVcb, while the student-tun Plans setvic offered
customizable proﬁles and the ability to form social networks online.

All it takes to join Facebook is an email address from one of the cola
lcgcs that the site’s organizers have approved. With an account, students
post basic information such as their name, dorm room, and home high
school. Those so inclined can also post “extended info," such as tastes in
music, movies and hooks oi the student’s relationship status. All entries
can bc clickcd to bring up a listing of all other Grinnell students who also
share that interest. Studcnrs can upload pictures ofthcmsclves,and also list
what classes they are taking.

other Ivy League colleges and then beyond. Many Grinnell

students said that they had found out about the program
from friends at other colleges who had already become avid users of Face-
boolt. Those friends at other colleges are also viewable on a student's profile,
under a special section.

Students on Faccbook can also create and join “groups" that bring together
people with similar interests. Some popular groups include one for graduates
pfpublic high schools, organizations for residents of particular campuses or
dorms, and i group for fans ofJ.l< Rowling’s Harry Potter books.

Some students post many details about themselves on their site. However,
Facebook also has primcy preferences where a user can chose to restrict who
can see their information, banning specific pcople or only allowing “friends"
access,

Programmers work on [Yellow Tail], which will add features, change Plans behind the screen

EV DAVID ARCHER
If Plans ain't broke, don't fix it. But whcn it becomes unwieldy to manage
and improve, then grab the latest programming tools and go to work.
Accordingly, three determined students have assumed the task of rewriting
the Plans software with the latest version of the php programming language
(php 5) in order to update the current software, which they describe as an un-
maintainable “house ofcards."

The programmers said the system might accommodate “smart" autofrnger
lists in which users could create lists based on critcria other than user name. For
txarnplc, a user could create a list of users who have given rhcm plnnlovc. Us-
crs could also name their lists or create as many lists as they likeThc current
system now allows users three levels.

Users can also expect to see a spellcheck feature, as well as joint ownership of
accounts for groups with several leaders. In addition, [Yellow

Tail] may add an address book feature, especially for alumni

bcrs ofcrinnell College, including students, alumni, faculty, staffand
other directly rclarcd people or groups.

“Ourjob is to create a technical foundation so Plans can go

Most changes will not be visible to Plans users, as the bulk of their work
focuses on the technical foundation behind the interface. However, the rewrite
will allow the software to accommodate many new features, several of which
will likely get implemented some time during spring semester 2005.

allow for customizable style sheets that would give users
more control over their plan’s appearance and layout.

They also want to make the software more Compatible
as an openrsoutcc project. ”Because it's open source means we shouldn't code it
in a way that limits other systems," Lyon said.

The group said they are only responsible for technical changes and making
new features possible, while the system administrators will decide which fea—
tutcs to implement. The group is still open to creating other features.
