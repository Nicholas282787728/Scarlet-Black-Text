On Feb. 2, the Intergov»
crnmentnl Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), colnmissioned
by the United Nations, rca
leased its fourth report on
global warming, declaring a
90 percent probability that humans are responsible for recent
rising global temperatures. Despite the issues long history
and some dissent within the scientiﬁc community, the report
added fuel to the growing debate on how best to tackle the
problem.

on Wednesday, China adopted its first measure addressa
ing global warming, hoping to cut carbon dioxide emissions
by 10 percent in the next five yearstYet Chinese ofﬁcials reit-
erated reluctance to enact hardeline regulations, citing tear or
stalling economic growth. Instead, the country’s leadership is
placing primary responsibility {or curbing greenhouse emis-
sions upon the developed nations and the United States in
particular.

United States ofﬁcials have frequently called for China,
along with other developing nations, to assume a greater role
in reducing emissions. Currently, China is the world's sec-
ondalargesr producer of greenhouse gases and, by one estia
mate, within the next two years-will overtake Germany to
become the world’s third largest economy behind Japan and
the United States. China currently has the world’s largest for
eign currency reserves.

Committee courts Obama for commencement

By CHRIS NEUBERT

When the class or 2007 graduates this May, they will be
welcomed into their now lives by someone who is smart. articue
larc,and respected throughout the world. But who that person
will be remains undecided, and could be anyone from Barack
Obama to Oprah Winfrey.

Members of the 2007 Commencement Committee, who
will make this crucial decision, are responsible for planning
various important events during senior year, including 100 days,
baccalaureate, senior showcase and, orcoursc, commencement.
The Committee started meeting as early as last spring, and imr
mediately begun discussing potential commencement speakers.

According to one member of the committee, Colin Reyn-
olds '07, the process began with the whole committee suggest
ing various names with each member indicating their prefer-
ences in a list of five candidates. These VOICS contributed to a
ﬁnal List of ten candidates which were reviewed by members of
the faculty, and from which the commencement speaker will
eventually be chosen, According to committee coordinator
Rachel Bly ’93, the current list is “filled with interesting and
phenomenal people."

At the top ofthe list is US. Senator Barack Obama, who
recently announced his candidacy for us. President. But de—
spite having been invited last semester he has not given a direct
answer, “There are schedule conﬂicts that need to be worked
around," said Bly. “And given the political season the process

is lengthened and decision making becomes difﬁcult." While
it is not uncommon for candidates at the top ofthe list to de—
clinc, Bly also clariﬁed that the Obama campaign has not ycr
said no, but is simply reluctant to plan their schedule several
months in advance. Nonetheless, she said that “ata certain time
it becomes more important to have a speaker than to continue
waiting."l(0bama does not accept by the end ofFebruary, Bly
said she will retract the invitation.

The committee has already started to court other speakers.
The committee‘s second choice, comedian Stephen Colbert,
has already declined the offer since he will be promoting his
new book during Cnnnell’s graduation. Recently, Ely has con»
tacted the committee’s third choice, activist Angela Davis.\vho
has yet to respond to the offer. Other names on the List include
Shirley Ann Jackson, Ben Carson, and Oprah VVlnfrey.

Whoever ultimately accepts the invitation this year will
have big shoes to fill. Previous commencement speakers have
included speakers as diverse asJane Addams andjohn Kenneth
Galbraith, .

Still, Bly, Reynolds, and the rest ofthe committee are hope-
ful that Obama will respond positively, and are excited about
the possibilities ofhaving a figure like Obama speak at gradus
ation. Bly thinks Grinnell has a certain “edge"over other col—
leges, especially considering the college's convenient political
location, particularly before the Iowa caucuses. Even Oprah
Winfrey will have something say.

 

Dems
from p. i

merit.” Simpson College, Drake University and Iowa State
are also working on similar resolutions, but the Campus Dems
would like Grinnell to set the precedent.

To send the most compelling message possible, the campus
Democrats want the issue decided as soon as possible “The
political impact ofthis resolution diminishes day by day,” said
Schierenbeck.

some students, such as FTP leader Emily Kugisaki, sups
port the Campus Dems being vocal on national politics. “It
speaks strongly of the opinion otthc youth,"Kugisaki said of
the Resolution.

Other students are concerned that the Resolution does not
represent the beliefs of all Grinnell students. “Making the coin
lege take a stance on this opinion does not reﬂect individual
thought," said Vice President or Campus Republicans Kristen
Hoctt '07, “This does not represent Grinnell College."

There is also concern about whether or not SGA should
deal with the resolution in the first place, According to Chris
Hall '05, SGA President, many senators received strong opin—
ions from constituents on both sides of the issue.

“People were very emphatic about it one way or the other
so it was hard to ﬁnd middle ground” Hall said. “[Making it a
student initiative] strikes a good balance."

~Librarian ofthe College Richard Fyffc appeared as a spe
cial guest. Fyffe said that the new Library Survey would be
ready soon, asking senators to encourage student participation.

-The revised Iraq resolution was considered again, with
members of both Campus Democrats and campus Repub-
licans present. Senators were concerned that the resolution
would negatively impact ideological diversity, and a student
statement was issued questioning the conduct of the troops.
The resolution was indefinitely tabled. Instead, an “emergency
student initiative"is being planned for a vote on Monday.

~SGA approved budgets for Prison Writing Workshop

It also approved the Spring 2007 semester budget.

The practice space resolution was presented to Joint

a practice space. Senators will discuss the resolution with con-
stituents this week, and will vote on the resolution next week.

plans to bring student art to the JRC. Possible changes in»
clude bringing a mural to the game room and installing student

tives has also been moved to Feb. 23 in order to give Joint Board
