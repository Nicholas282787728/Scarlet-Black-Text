Resolution brought to Joint Board by
Gn‘nnell's anti-sweatshop student group

Thefullawmg resolution was introduced on March It It will be voted on
by Joint Board on Wednesday March a. Senators are currently gathering
constrtuent feedback on the resolution.

Whereas, Grinnell College is committed to conducting its business
affairs in a socially responsible manner consistent with its educational
mission,

Whereas Grirmell College gives permission to manufactures to use
the Griririell college name, trademark, and/or images,

Whereas Grinnell College students do not want businesses with
explotive labor practices to profit from the use of the Grinnell College
name,

Whereas Gnnnell College joined the Fair labor Association without
consulting the student body,

whereas the Fair labor Association has been repudiated by human
rights and labor leaders from around the world for its lack of public
disclosure and weak standards,

Whereas other universities, including University of Pennsylvania and
the_ University of Wisconsin at Madison, have recently expressed their
desire to withdraw from the Fair Labor Association due to its inherent
corporate bias,

Whereas the recently formed Worker Rights Consortium addresses key
issues which the Fair Labor Association does not, such as broad public
disclosure, commitment to localindependcnt monitoring, and widespread
support from human rights groups, labor organizations, and persons
working to improve sweatshop conditions from around the world,

Whereas the above universities and others, including bard, brown,
Haveriord, Indiana University, Loyola New orleans, Oberlin and Univer-
sity of Michigan have made commitments to the Workers Rights Consor-
tium, thereby acknowledging that it is the responsib' ‘ty of their admin»
istrations and students to ensure that all their licensed products are
made under humane, noneexploitative conditions,

_ whereas Grinnell College has a similar responsibility,

Whereas the student body currently does not know the nature of the
conditions under which products bearing the Grinriell College trademarks
were made,

Be it therefore also resolved that the Grinnell College student gov-
ernmentAssociation recommend that Grinnell College withdrawtrom the
Fair labor Association and commit to the Worker rights consortium,

Beit ﬁnally resolved that Grinnell College condemn the use ofsweatv

Here's a little bll ofGrinnell trivia for

answer is the Social iusrrcc Action Group,
which is headed by rhrcc women and cup
renrly consists ofappwximalcly 10 female
studunts. Almosr nn one but heard buzz

Almost no one has even heard orrlus group.
Thar is because this group has only recently

I sat down with Deanna Sliorb about

talk about the group, what it is, and what it is

Pastor Reirz is Working to Find this our by
announcing the existence or SJAG at her

coming involved with is
the new youth center in
town, As an lowa girl
myself, I lrnow Shorb is
right when she says that
there is “not much to do”
For a youth in lown. This
is why SJAG is looking into this proi r. Dur-
ing the implementation and organiznrion or
this new youth eenrer, the social Justice Ac-
rion Group will be working with Grinnell

same principle omnding our the needs orthe

laeeause Shorb is our chaplain and Rcilz
a pastor, i asked snorb how closely related
SJAG is and will be to religion. “Not at all,”
she says “[SJAG] is not about prosclynzing
or getting people into pews, bur about cre-
ating community."

However, she' also believes that ira per-
son is religious rhere is no way to separate
religion and social jusucc. she comments on
this saying that, while SJAG is not “overtly
connected to the church," For her “personv
ally, social justice has everything to do with
[her] religious understanding and aim tra»
diticn."

Although this ﬂedgling group may not
be very well known in Grinnell yet, because
orrhe energy and enthusiasm they have and
their goal otgerting the entire Grinnell com.
munity excited about social justice action,
I’m sure we'll be hearing a lot more about
them in the futum, lryou would like to join
SJAG or have an idea about a social action
project in the town or college community
(or both), you can contact Deanna shorb at
the Cluplain's office in Macy House at ex»

sine meetings areTuesdays at 5:30 pm.
and rah-e place over an informal dinner at
private residences. laut it seems that these
private residences are not so private anymore,
that once a week they open to house a very
optimistic and energetic group, determined
to get things done.
