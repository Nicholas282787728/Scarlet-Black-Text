“Well I heard it costs all sorts of money to go to
this college here." My ears perk up at what can only be
a reference to my most treasured and costly education.
“I just hope those kids have the sense to appreciate be-
ing at such a great insiinition.”

My diminutive hands begin to shake in fury as I
listen to this baseless slander. Armed with my liberal
arts critical thinking skiils,l effortlessly read between
rhe sordid lines of these seemingly ins nocent
comments. A clump of sad,

them Vivienne and Boys

Disguised bencam my child-like stature,wirh a iace

student. I listen, intent and undetected, pondering my

Viverly. 1 got plenty of common sense. When I lived
in a real house over the summer, I ﬁgured out how to
put the trash in big yellow bags so that it disappears in

And I found out that ifyou leave a piece offurni-

Who's got the sense now,

Violence is bad

I would like to respond to the letter to the edis
tor of last week’s S€iB issue, titled “Violent resrstance
can do good."Thc author brought up some very good
points considering the problem of resisting against an
unjust system, governmental or otherwise. However,
his fundamental point was that violence can be justir
ﬂed in certain situations, which I happen to disagree
with. _

The idea that Violence can be justiﬁed in certain
situations is a notion which, I think, most people
agree with. I don't think that violence can be justiﬁed;
I think that violence can be explained.

Violence is a product of a social environment,
caused by external factors, and not internal factors.
Looking at the world today, it would be safe to say
this View is correct.

There is an epidemic ofviolence: terrorism in the
Middle East and Europe, gang warfare everywhere
and a genocide in Sudan. This cannot be because
all of these people actually hate and wish death on
the people they are rebelling against (or oppressing).
There must be an external trend to explain each difs
ferent situation of violence, and, most of the time,
there is,Therefore violence can be explained.

But explanation doesn’t constitute justice. Just
because violence can be explained, either in the ins
dividual sense or the collective sense, does not mean
that there is no other way, or a better way. Violence
may solve things in the short run. Revolutions and
wars may end the problems oia iew generations, and
a couple of acts of terrorism may expose corruption of
an instimtion. But in the long run, these violent acts
solve nothing.

There are examples of the endless cycle orvio—
lence everywhere. The war in Iraq has created, and
will continue to create, more terrorists than have ever
existed in the Fertile Crescent. These terrorists will
then commit their own acts ot’violencc, creating more
violent reaction.

The cyclical nature of violence can only be bras
ken by individuals who, in situations that warrant and
justify the use ofviolence, choose not to act in violent
ways,Thcre are other ways to do good without vice
lence, as seen in the works or many dirrereut people.
The people that step away from the cycle of violence
arc the truly good people, and the people that will
make the most difference in our world.

The author of“Vlolent resistance can do good"
says that a person choosing to participate in violent
rebellion is making somewhat of a self-sacrifice. Re»
belliug against any sort ofnormal institution is an act
ofself—sacriﬁce.

The choice that a rebel individual must make is
how to rebel. A rebel does no good when they rake
something for themselves and make mother's life
worse on. This process just creates another rebel, and
coutiuucs the cycle orviolence.

Violence is never an internal choice, but a reac—
tion to the circumstantial world.This is how violence
can be explained, but violence is never right. It only
creates morc violence and more suffering for all of
humanity.

The only way to stop this suffering is to under
stand the cause ofvtolence, and understand that there
is a peaceful way, With this understanding, the world
will be a better place. ,
