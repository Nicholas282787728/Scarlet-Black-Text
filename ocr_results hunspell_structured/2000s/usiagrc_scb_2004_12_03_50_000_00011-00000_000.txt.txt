Posse One misrepresented

Dear Editor,

A couple of weeks ago, in an article titled Posse lower"
rhcrc was a rnisrcproscntation ofthe group, Grinncll Posse Onc
Whereas the entire article focused on Grinnell Posse Two, one
of only two sentences mentioning Posse One was a note of how
many multicultural students we admitted into Llie group. The
sentence read: “Ofthe 12 students in 20075 Posse class, eleven are
multicultural students." This implies that one ofour members is
white. Igot the sense that our one white scholar didn't really con,
tribute to the diversity at Grinnell...and that’s absolutely wrong.
As a college,we are constanriy Lrying to bring diversity to campus,
but end up deﬁning it as solely racial. The reporter failed to meir
tron that the scholar was Jewish and comes from a community
where he was the minority; the dominant religion is Catholicism
and the dominant race is Latino. This makes our singled-out
scholar as multicultural as any other member of the Posse groups.
As a scholar myself, I am sometimes offended by the notions
people get when they hear I’m from Posse, and I think the re-
porter deﬁnitely helped by breaking down some of those negative
notions, but at rhc same time made a mistake by misjudging our
“lefteont” scholar. I believe that we all contribute one way or air
other to the diversity on campus, but I also feel that we shouldn’t
always judge ouicrs'culrural capital by means ofskin color,

Danny Carroll apologizes
for Republican mailing

A rLant “open letter” address to me was printed in the No-
vember 15th edition of the Gi‘l'nml/Hemlr/ch'mm and asked for
a response. I would like to offer the followmg as a reply to that
letter.

In the recent election the Democratic Party made a deter-
mined eft‘ort to register college students to vote. They did so
because more often than not (host: votcrs will register as Demos
crats and vote accordingly. It has been their practice both locally
and throughout the state for many years. This year was different
in that Iowa was a battleground state in the Presidential came
paign. Students were encouraged to votc in Iowa, instead of their
“hometown," where their vote would carry greater weight in the
Bush/Kerry contest. In addition the Democrats targeted two lo-
cal mccs, spcnding hundreds orthousnnds or dollars to dctcat
Senator Neal schuorcr and myscir. Thc local Democratic Party
also arranged for two satellite voting locations on the college
campus one on October 5‘“ and another on October 30th. This
combined vvrth an aggressive absentee voting effort was designed
to convert those registrations to actual votes on Election Day. It
was a logical political strategy on the part ofthe Democrats and

Not so liberal with music,huh.7

I’m frustrated about the music played at Harris
parties, not many people go to the smaller (sometimes
more innovative) parties anyway My frustration lies in
the choice of music the so—called “djs” play there. but
a dj supposed to be creative and animate the crowd to
have a good time with a great variety of songs? And
shouldn't a dj every now and then surprise the peo-
ple with a new song they have never heard before or
an old one they havon't board since high school? Do
you really think its innovative and animating to play
Cliingy, 50 cent, Nelly and old Madonna songs nt
cvcry Harris party.> You’re right...
at Harris parties. Grinnell is a strange place and as
liberal as it seems, the music selection at its patties
reminds me of the election results on Nov 2nd. No
offence intended to rho Bush voters on campus...ac

it seems to work

one can hardly blame them for working hard to carry out the
plan

In icsponsL to this political ottort the Republican Party in
Iowa distributed .r brochure in House District 75 alerting" Re-
publicans to this tactic being used by tho Democrats. (3.an the
effort orrhc DornoL-rnrs to take adva’ntago ora rather large block
nl’fricndlv partisan votLrs onL can hardly blame tho Republicans
{or trying to thwirt that effort.

HovaLr thL biacliul‘ in question w as maccamrc in thc way it
portrayed Grinnell CollL snidcnts. T he mailing Indicated that
“1,000 cast-coast liber' kids"\vould be voting, That is not accrrr
rate. Then: are not 1,000 students from the eastrcoast attending
Grinnell College. In addition, of those who do attend Grinnell
not all are “liberal" in their political philosophy. Furthermore [lie
mailing said “They’re not from here. They won't stay here. But
they're voting here". Technically those are true statements. Most
Grinnell College students have hometowns somewhere othcr
than House District 75 or Iowa. As the letter stated only about
10 percent of the Grinnell College strrderrts are from Iowa. Also,
most Grinnell College students will leave Iowa after graduation,
SCIPE (student Campaign for Increased Political Enga tgcmcnt)
found the statements offensive and felt like they were meant to
exclude “student residents"from the democratic process. If I were
in their position I might feel the same way.

iwould like to publicly apologize for the inaccurate statements
in th brochure Although I did not see the mailing prior to its
distribution I should have and will try to do better in the future.
Having been the Victim of repeated distortions, exaggerations and
outright lacs in the form or political brochures I can sympathize
with those who ﬁnd themselves in similar circumstances.

In order for ma to do my best in serving thL people ofHouse
District 75 in the 81st General Assemblyl need to put this elec-
tion behind me. It was one or the most disturbing cvpcrionccs
in my political ovpcricnce and I don't think we should dwell on it
any more. As I said in the interview with the papet“The election
is over. This was an unpleasant orericncc for all involvcd. Let’s
put it behind us and move on".

Apology to moviegoers

To the Harris Cinema movie goers of thc Friday (Nov 19)
7:30 pm. showing ofGarclen State, I’m so sorryi I was the pro-
jectionist who was supposed to show the film during the above
timcsloc.Whnr happened was entirely due to my error in copying
down details.

wchs ago, while ruling in my Laandar for the month, I‘d
marked down "Sirowing 7:30 movic dt Harris” on the Samrdny
Nov 20 spot insrLad oftlic Friday 19 spot without realizrng it.

At the same am, it so happened that I was preparing for the
GRE that I was taking the next day, so I was holed rip in some
computer lab whcic nobody could and me right after dinner Frin
day cvcning until early Saturday morning Thars why nobody
could get uhold ofrne to come show the movie when they teat
ized that the projectionist didn't show up on time.

I understand that it was a hill house that night,I truly am
sorry for the incovcnienee caused; I take ﬁill responsibility for my

error and apologize for it.

Stop the howling

On Friday, Nov 19 i was jolted awake by rhc deep,
guttuml bellowing of what I presumed to be, some
drunken hooligan. H; (for it was a lone male voice)
had nothing to say, no message of urgent importance,
nor did he yelp out ofjubilec or acute anguish

No, this was disrupting my peace for the sake of.
disnrpting my peace alone. In thL lapse of time be—
tween that evening and today, Sunday, has done it
again-the same famous, excruciating howl So who-
ever you. are ,you attention starved, fraternity boy per
sour, stop this at once. It is intolerable.
