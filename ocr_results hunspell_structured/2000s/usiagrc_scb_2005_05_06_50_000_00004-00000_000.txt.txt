Samurai and
Shakespeare

Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem
Cards combines Shakespearean

and Kabuki traditions
Bv KATIE JARES

According to Todd Pitman ‘07, the blend of Kn»
buki and Shakespearean theatrical traditions has crca
arrd a unique end producr in Fair Lin/I'M a! v Grunc of
Farm Cnidr.

In this version of F/m' Ludo, ploduccr Lesley
Delmico blends the trademarks of Kabuki theatre
with Shakespearean-based verse. Pitman, who plays
Yoshirsugu. rhe younger of the two main Samurai,
cxplained,“1'm not sure anyone was ren-ibly comforts
ablc with [the blending ofthcalrical traditions] at the
beginning, but...by now [ir] has transformed into n
wonderfully polished producuon,"he said.

Nikita Umnov ‘07, who plays Lord Shigcmori, rhc
brother of the Empress, agreed. “My favorite scene in
rhc play is...when Yoshirsugu and Takiguchi mccr up
with Yokobuc and Karumo in the dark and realize that
rhcy have by accident taken rhe wrong partner's," she
said.“This is a very funny and Shakespearean scene in
tclms of the misunderstanding, something along the
lines ofA Miriam/1m- Niglzl’t Dream."

The acrors have spcnr .ipprorirnarely rwenry hours
a week rehearsing and getting in touch with their
characters Pitmdn noted similarities between himself
and his character.

“He's a samurai who has this kind of sarcastic,
frat-boyish personality that I find is vely similar to
my own mindscr," Pitman said. “He likes ro joke
around and rake jabs ar ourhorrry ﬁgures and sorr
ofbe a general wiserass, which is why i think I’m so
suited to the role."

‘Baby,’ meet my parents

Meet the Fo'ckers proves to be a lackluster sequel to a mediocre movie, while
Million Dollar Baby proves it really earned that Oscar and.all those tears

rovuMEs

Movies, unlike books and other boring storytellr
ing media, allow our imaginations to wander. Like,
imagine ifthat fake sitcom “The Livematcs"from last
week’s Titular Head ﬁlm TV Timn was scquelizcd,
stretched out to two hours, and had acclaimed acr
tor Dustin Hoffman instead of that nobody johanna
Nlarvel ‘05. And throw in a baby swearing a lot. Whar
you’d be dreaming is Mum/1: kam.

In its opening minurss, MM ”16’ For/rm does a
glcatjob of summarizing Mm [111’ Farm/i, which is so
rm] lequired viewing. In P/n'z'ills, an unfunny actor—
Ben Stiller!——rs a guy with a runny namcicaylord
Fockcrliand a funny occupationirnale nursc!7inr
rei'acts awkwardly with his father»‘rn~law, a former
CIA agcnr—Robcrr DeNiro! 1n the end, Focker gets
to sleep with the hot chick (Teri Polo), so everyone
leaves happy. In rhe scqllc1,thc awkward interaction
quorionr is doubled as we moor Gay’s parents, a stays
arrhome dad (Dustin Hoffman) and a sex therapist
for old fogies (Barbra Streisand). And, for fun, the
CIA agent gets to carry around a baby. ,

There’s an easy, olivqucsrion test that will tell
you ifynu should see Mien/2cm): docs the phrase
“meet the Fochcrshnake you laug . linrghl, because
“Pockets” sounds like “fuckers”, and saying rhar word
in public is reprehensible—thanks, Purirans! if it is
funny, head for the Forum tonight or tomorrow. our
crwiso, just drink in your room, watching letuns of
C/Jﬂ/ifc/Iuk S/Iﬂ'll/ iryou wanr to laugh.

'1 hejokes in Mar My Far/wrl—rhcre are a few be-
sides rhar iasr namciarc not so much stalc as they arc
obviousThey do work occasionallyiespecially when
delivered by Hoffman—but you can usually see them
telegraphed minutes in advance. Several times during
the ﬁlm I had to work to remember the last time i
laughed.

Thanks to the addition oflaloffnran and Streisand,
MM [/15 Far/rm passes the “sequel tcst,"mcasrrrrng up
to its predecessor, Mm ”.111 Pm'imll'. _It does a goodjob
ofrctclling old jokes and sprinkling in new ones, on:
rhose old jokes just woren'r too smurr rho frrsr rime
around.

ii't’i/ir'wtd by Brnd/ry Imrl‘kaa/rg

This movie sounds as cliche as they come: a
grizzly old boxing trainer whose stone cold heart is
melted by a spunky and lovable young srar, But Clint
Eastwood's Mil/ion Dal/m Baby is as original as they
come, and earned every inch ofthc Best Picture statue
it won.

The story is about Frankie: Dunn (Clint East-
wood), owner ofu shabby gym in Los Angcles and
his longrimc best friend Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freer
mail), who provides narration for the movie. Their
sparring is a delightful iributc to rhe wonders of a
longtime friendship. Frankie is remarkably oriented,
but mo timid to try to achieve any success on his
oer I-lc gcrs his chance in Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilv
dry Swank), a 30-year-old woman who walks into his
studio and demands hc train llcrr

Frankie says she is too old, not to mention that he
doesn‘t rrain girls, but thanks to the classic “scrappy
and cagcr porcnrinl star and warm convincing old
buddy convince grumpy old man to sorrcn his hard
heart and do what they want him to." the two are soon
on a one wily path to greatness.

At this poinr,il is your typical underdog story, and
a good one at rhar. But Mil/I'm: Dollar lin/ry refuses
to fade into obscurity with countless other underdog
stories. and the second half of the movie Is powerful
in a way that few movies can hc.

In fact, SEiE cdiror-iu—chiofAly Bccry was sup
posed to write this review, bur was so overwhchncd by
her tears (she has never cried harder in a movie), that
she couldn't bring herself to write it.

The ﬁlm hardly ever stmys from the rhrsc main
characters, all ofwhorn play their parts with unassum-
ing grace and talent, and it is a delight to watch. It
would be impossible to impress upon you the enormi—
ty of rhis seemingly casrlal film wirhour giving away
what makes it so fabulous.

But it is a llcal'nvrenching ﬁlm, and Eastwood
does nor use cheap ploys, like sex subplots, to add in»
Ki'igue. Indeed, it is hoarnvrcuching .md powerrul in
the most human way possible, and that’s wluu made
Aly sob uncomioilably.
