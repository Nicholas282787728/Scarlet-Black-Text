Listening to political discussions around cams
pus, I sometimes notice an alniostrpalpable, even
visceral, hatred tor George w, Bush. Although I
too disagree with his administration, policies,
method orseeuring his other, and (especially) the
ethical system he and his corworkers use, I cannot
hate him, I cannot hate him beeanseeer might have
turned out much like him, had circumstances been
just slightly diffcient.
