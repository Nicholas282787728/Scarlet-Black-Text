I’m the first person to admit that I did a
lot of questionable things in middle school.l
recently looked through a photo album and
realized that I owned an entire outfit made
of denim, Including shoes. I don’t know who
made and sold these clothes, but part of me
thinks that I might have been a major plot-
lrne in a reality TV show called, “JustTry and
Make Friends Now, I Dare You."

The series of school pictures on our wall
at home looks like the evolution of man from
some terri 'ing monkey beast. In seventh
grade, my shirt looks like it was made from hus
man hair; in eighth grade, I'm at least 90 per
cent male. I guess I thought things would get
better once I got to high school, but that was
before I discovered mousse and the ability to
stick my hair back into an impenetrable shell.

over the last break, my brother and I are
amined my seventh grade yearbook and dis-
covered rhatI actually signed it myself, three
separate times, pretending to be other people. I
almost can't believe I'm writing this down and
sharing it with potentially 1400 people, but

Analyzing your choice of AIM font? Don’t use Comic Sans

Rachel Fields ’09 talks about the importance of choosing a cool AOL Instant Messaging font throughout middle and high school

that's the way oflife. One decade you’re wear»
ing dolphin earrings and wishing you were
popular, and the next decade you’re wearing
the same pair of jeans most of the tune and
laughing about how lame you used to be.

Unfortunately, these ﬂagrant social viola-
tions aren't the worst of it. “Really, Rachel?"
you say, "Is that possible? You signed your own
yearbook I/Jr'ce Iimer. In the same penl You
weren’t even ttyrng to be sneakyl" Oli, gcnrle
reader, you have no idea. Last Sunday, my
friends and I sat down to watch “Helvetica,”a
sweet and highly recommended documentary
about fonts. We were about halfway through,
laughing about why anyone except a reincar-
nated ancient Egyptian would ever use the
Papyrus font, and i remembered something
terrible. For eight years in middle school and
high sehool.I used purple, bolded Comic sans
as my primary instant messaging font.

“Well, that's not very exciting," you might
be thinking. WRONG. Have you ever seen
Comic sans.> It's a font used primarily by the
middle school teachers who went Christmas

sweaters with baubles hanging off them. 1
think it's supposed

to look cute and

fun and childlike,

but it's more like

a highly advanced ‘

robot trying to pass

as a child in its pur-

suit ofworld domi—

nationThat’s rightTERRlFYING.

I didn't realize my faux pas until junior year
of high school, when my best friend (himself
a user of whire-on-black Times New Roman)
asked me ifI used the font while talking online
to my recently acquired prom date. “I mean,
it’s not a big deal," he said hastily when I ex-
pressed confusion. “I'm sure he'll realize it’s a
joke,"

“HAHAHA.”I said.“YES OF COURSE.
WHAT A LAUGH. IRONY IS 50 HOT
RIGHT NOW.“ But inside I was confused
and surprised What was wrong, I wondered.
Was it the sassy purple? The proud and Cons
fident holding? Little did I realize rhat the

font itself was, as the creators of town; lac.

tmnirrmurour put it,

“like showing up to

a black tie event in

a clown costume."

And worst of all,

. something told me

I had been at that

event beforemsport-

ing a bowl cut,wearing a denim onesie, touring

my yearbook full of suspiciously similar signer

turesfl‘liis appeared to be a pattern, and ifthis

Comic Sans debacle was anything to go by, it

was the kind that didn't become apparent until
it was much too late.

Yeats have passed since then, and I'm
proud to say I've grown, My favorite font now
is Verdana, not coincidentally the default font
ofLivejournal. But whatever, I’m not ashamed.
I've owned a teddy bear waistcoat; it literally
can't get any worse. In fact, fetch me this year's
issue of tlic Cycloneil have a few things to
say, and I know just the pseudonyms to sign
them with.

Commitment to our values and the free exchange of ideas

one of the most important things that a
college or university does is promote intel»
lectual curiosity
and tolerance. At
the same time, (201*
leges also have val
lies and identities
that they wish to
preserve and foster.

Notre Dame Unis

versity, for instance, claims its Catholic iden
tity proudly. However, it has invited President
Obama, who differs from Church teachings
on several issues, to be the commencement
speaker. Can these differences be reconciled’

I can't speak for Notre Dame, but at
Grinnell this would not be a contradiction.
While we have other ‘mlues to which we are
committed, we also encourage and support
the free exchange of ideas in and outside of
the classroom. But is this balancing always

successful? In my ii years as president I have

dealt with complaints that involve the tension

in accommodating

our values and our

commitment to fret:

and open discourse.

A numbel of oul

conservative alumni

complain that earns

pus discourse is

entirely onersrded, meaning politically liberal.

Similarly, we have oceasronally witnessed epi»

sodes otfree speech that were said to denrgrate

a group or groups of people here on campus.

Sometimes this has bordered on “hate” speech

and other times it has been directed against

those not usually the subject of hate speech.

Finally, I have also heard from students who

feel constrained in what they can say or discuss
about some sensitive issues.

In a similar vein, recent attention has been

focused on middle and high school textbooks
and their portrayal of religious, historical and
geopolitical issues. Are the Palestinians slightr
ed or is the opposite rrue? Is Christianity deni»
grated> Speech is of course nor only oral but
includes newspapers. books, and live and digi-
tal media. What obligations do we have when
expressing ourselves to try and be fair and can
we srmultaneously feel comforrable presenting
our own beliefs and values?The weakening of
broad-based newspapers coincides with the
growth of narrow and opinionrfocused digital
and visual media and is perhaps contributing
to our sense of unease about a possible loss of
balance and opensmindedness.

There are issues that should not be the subs
jecr ofpublic discourse.The health situation of
an individual student comes to mind, and Ollie
er similar confidential matters. That a particu-
lar exercise of speeeh simply makes someone
uncomfortable cannot be the test ofwhether

that speech should be banned. Human be-
ings have to make judgments every day about
appropriate behavior and while we encourage
and need free speech we should all be mindful
of the situations of those around us and what
public discourse rnighr mean.

While I don't have a simple answer to
rhis set of problems and concerns, I do be
lieve that educational institutions have to be
particularly zealous rn these times ro preserve
and protect free expression and open inquiry
on the issues of the day and rhe fundamental
questions of human life, Faculty and students
need to feel free in the classroom to disagree
with the dominant opinion of a group, a place,
or a time our views and values are molded,
changed, and reformed in the process of be-
ing exposed to differing views or entirely new
perspectives and the experience ofengaging in
these differences is a central feature ofa liberal
arts education.
