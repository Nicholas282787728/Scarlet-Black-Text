Love or basketball?

Big—lime basketball is at Darby, but two top—notch love stories are

also on campus this weekend.

Punch-Drunk Love (R)

B: There are many kinds oilove in the worldithos:
based on friendship, admiration, physical attraction. Comv
mitmcnr, and even societal standing. Then, chores Fund/e
Doro/r Loire. the kind that intoxicates and completely domi—
nates your life. yet makes you stronger than even you iniag.

l: l missed this one, but if it holds a candle to Paul
Thomas Anderson’s other directorial cﬂ'om—even to the
lackluster HardEig/Jl—I can'tirnagrne be.
ing disappointed, What say you, Brad?

B: In this movie, Barry Egan (Adam
Sandlci), a very nervous and un.
liappy small businessman in a
blue suit, unexpectedly ﬁnds
such a love with Lena Leonard
(Emily Watson), a shy but
crafty Birrish transplant to
Soulhern California.
complicating their love is
American Airlines, Healthy
Choice pudding, and some
Mormon brothers led by Dean (Philip Seymour Holfmau).

RT. Anderson, the virtuoso writer and director of the
California epics Boogie Mgiirr and Magnolia, succeeded in
making a much smaller and shorter film that's a sweet bal-
lad to love. As always, his camem is very active, following
around the excited characters through scenery that shifrs
from boring citysmpes to an island oasis.

The casting in this ﬁlm is perfch Anderson. a huge
Adam Sandler fan, created the to]: ofBarry speciﬁully for
him. Barry may he like most oisindler's other characters,
but his humble feat, violent anger, .lnd stuttering infatua—
tion all make sense within this ﬁlm. Watson is great as rho
underdeveloped object or Barry‘s passion. She's perfectly
charming, yet awkward, Philip Seymour Hoffman is the
greatest character actor around, and he conﬁdently Cour
trols each ofhis scenes,

piece of cinematic mndy with an aftertaste as

Die Another Day (PG-13)

B: l have a feeling that the basketball games in
Darby may wipe out this James Bond film's core ‘
audience, but we should review it anyway. That
thankless task goes to you, Jeremy.

J: No problem, Brad, I love writing scathing
negative reviews and there were few movies diis
past year that deserve such a lambasting than
this worthless addition to the Bond series. The
movie starts with Bond on assignment in
North Korea Aﬁcr a hovercraft chase, the
enemy captureshimWhile beingrortuted,

doesn't go downhill From there; there is

Aorilm Day is as exciting as being

joy to watch as Bond Halle Berry is a
good Bond girl, but she doesn‘t irrrtmnt

Catch an adolescent New Wave ﬁlm

Staff Reviewer

Modern movie moments of Carrier in W [eye adoles-
ccnr angst and frustration are becoming as common as
explosions, gun ﬁghts, and John C. Reilly supporting roles.
Bur French writer/director Francois Truffaut's debut film
The 400 Blow, released in 1959 in response to challenges
that he, then a critic, couldn't make a film that stood up to
his own standards, chronologically precedes these clrehc's
and remains fresh and exciting.

Thcopening ctodrrs roll over a fur paced car ride monr
rage of Paris. As the film proper begins, we are shown a
classroom during an exam. A pinup calendar is passed
around the room and the teacher happens to catch it in

Title: The ‘00 Blows

young Antoin: Doincl’s (Jeaanicn': Léaucl) hands, taking
away his recess and making him stand in the comet, This
sets ortrhe desperate spiral in Doincl’s life that comprises
the rest oirhe ﬁlm.

At home that night, we meet Doinels family; his at.
triictivc mother (Claire Maurietl who is ashamed ornnd
frustrated by her son’s hcy‘s exisrener (until he discoveis
her having an strait) and his father (Alhcrr Rémy) who
thinks ofhim as little more than an oetastonal amusement.
Doincl has a schoolmare friend outside the runny, who
shares many ofthe same struggles, but is remarkably more
selipossossed. Doincl struggles, while his hmrt always seems
to he in the right place, the elect oihis every action goes
traglmlly Wrong, as when he is expelled from school for
innocently plagiarl‘lrlng his literary idol Balzac.

Doinei only ﬁnds himselisi peace in die movie [lic-
ater. considering that 7714' 400 Blows is Truiiaur’s attempt
to semiautohiogrrphically deal with his own childhood,
this is no surprise. But there is also a redemptive power at
the movies. In one instance, when Doincl gets in trouble
at homo. instead oipunishing the boy, die iamily goes our
to the movies, Afterward. on their my home in (hc ear,
the family is laughing and happy for the first and only
time

one oithc incredible ieanrres oi the ﬁlm is he sheer

power lent to visual images and silent moments. In one
moment. as the outcrsrudenrs work diligently duringrlass.

looking down, a PE teacher leadsstudents in awalk through
the streets. in small groups, the students leave the line to
run tree about the city, leaving the instructor blissfully
unaware. There is a simple elegance in rhoe shots and an
unspoken, established trust between filmmaker and audi.
ence dist make the images all the more powerful.

In rho rinsl sequence oi rhc ﬁlm, Doinel escapes and
runs away irom a disciplinary juvenile camp his parents
sent him to. He ﬁnally arrives at the coast. Early iii the
movte, Doinel establishes the ocean as his symbol oihope.
Now he has escaped the oppression ofl’aris, orschool. and
olrhe camp and hesreps into the ocean for the ﬁrst time in
his life. Amomentlaterheturnsbackand theramcia pause

The 4170 Blow: is commonly accepted as the first ﬁlm
of the French New Wave Cinema Tritiiaut followed up
the film with tour more based on the Antotnc Doinei char»
actor. The 400 Blows is available for checkout from the
hurling Listening Room.
