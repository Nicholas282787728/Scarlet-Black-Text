Free yourself

Ar lanko's memorialscrviae, something we said about
having the courage to ieryourselffcd, to ler yourselfzdmir
ro your feelings and to ler yourself ralk about more things
rhar seem iusr roo hard to out about.

I've always rhoughr char when ir comes righr down ro
ir. as sary as ir mighr seem, the only consranr you-re guar—
anread or have rhroughour your life, die only person you
ran cruly count on being there, is yourself. Thar doesn-r
mean you shouldn't rare abnur others, or int/5r in nrhcrr,
or our you're desrined us be lonely.

lr yusr means you need ro rake care ofyourself. You
need to do whar you need ro do and be who you need to
be. You’re rhe only one you have re answer so. And you
need us let rhings out. When tragedy happens, you need so
ieryourselffeel in order to cope.

Maybe rimc docs heal all wounds, but Lliatdocsn’tmun
you don’t gcr smrs. A [or of us have been scarred recently.

Earlier rhis semcsrcr I was rhinking that maybe life is
deﬁned by tragedy. Bemuse when I dunk about my life
and rhe cvcnrs rhsr have formed is, rhe rmson I am who i,
am and feel how I feel, i rhink about rragcdy. And hoivi
rusted rn it; how I conunue rn rmcr rd ir. Some rhingr
you never ger over.

There are momenrs, or, I'm sorry ro say, there will be
momenrs, when in a heartbear you fall from where you
were and you hir the ground hard It's like an acnial physi.
cal sensation. You didn't know how grcar things were a
second ago. How privileged you had been.

And is hits you rhar your life will never be me same.
And rhen all you can do is reacr. Maybe you'll sun to cry,
or stare into spade, or pay, or hypervenrilarc. I've been
rhinking about rharc momenrs and char maybe were just
all reaming to rragcdy. Month larer. years later, whatever.
Thar depresse me, rhough. So maybe were rcacring ro
rrsgedy and icy,

Surely rhere are wonderful memcnrs rhar fill you wirh
a ray rhar changes your life forever. There's gar rd be an.
other extreme. I have us believe rhar. imam believe rhar.

I've ncvcr been re another college and i don't know
how [0 evaluarecrinndls response ro depression. You know
whar they say about hindsighr. I advise everyone so get off
campus as much as possible. Ger some perspecrive

l find rhar walking rhrough the neighborhoods really
helps me when I’m upset. luar seeing people simng down
to dinner, or hearing someone pracricing a tub: from rhc
second story ofa house, or shoveling rheir sidewalk an
pur things in perspective for me. Getting out afrhc rown
is even better.

I rmlizc char leaving mmpua for an hour or so is not
going ro do much for a severely depressed person, but ic
has helped me over my time here. We are in a little liberal
arrs college in small rown lows.

Grinnell is not she cenrer of she world. crinncllianr

academics, we are abour making a difference, and we care
abour each purer. There a lor efmring especially for a
