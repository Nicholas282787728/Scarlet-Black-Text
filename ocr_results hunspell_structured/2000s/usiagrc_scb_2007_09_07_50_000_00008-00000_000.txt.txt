For Claire Thompson ’11, the first week of cldsscs began in
srress and tmstmrion. As one of427 new first-years crammed
into Harris registration that first hot \chncsday afternoon,
Thompson had to contcnd w.rh the normal problems ofclasscs
quickly filling to capacity. In addition to the traditional prob
lems, she also had the added pressure of contending with 12
more firstcyc s then expected in the class year during the plane
ning for prcregisirdrion, entering the auditorium us a member
of the ninrh group, and having me stalk her movements for
about 20 minutes.

While twelve students may not seem like an incredibly large
number, Eliza Willis, Political Science, said that among profese
sors who attended registration, “we had the sense that the extra
students did affect the availability ofclasses."

Still, the number was not large enough to cause concern for
Registrar Gerald Adams, who in a oneeline email said, “There
were no speciﬁc changes made this year for fiist—year students.”
In fact, registration this year was just as hectic, chaotic and
stress-inducing as it has been for several years.

Adams’ calm was little comfort for Thompson, who after
stops at the Political Science and the English departments,
ﬁnding nine classes filled to capacity, found het stress levels
slowly rising. "It is really trustrncing," she said “I couldn't get
into any of my favorite classes" After a brief check-in wirh
her adviser, she ﬁnally found limited success signing up for a
new section in the Spanish department Her elation quickly
dissipated, however, as she was tripped up by the layout ofrhe
room,

“This alphabet is not making sense," she exclaimed as she
was wedged between the German and Philosophy departments,
looking for Religious Studies. After regaining her bearings and
sifting through the thick alphabet soup,Thompson successfully
signed up for her last class, another bnckup.

Still, Thompson left Harris satisﬁed with her classes, if
frustrated that she missed out on her top choices. And ac
cording to Willis, her experience is not atypical, especially of
students who choose social sciences classes that tend to fill
up faster, yet added that there is always a bit of tension when
designing classes between the desire to maintain the Grinnell

experience through small classes and the need to accommodate
new students. “We want to maintain small classes, but are we
succeeding?”she asked.“Maybe not at the loo-level I worry
about intro classes and the pressure to make rhem larger."

Most first»year gmmhlings at registration, however, focus
on what many feel is an inherently unfair process. Jonathan
Ismael ’11 described the process as “archaic” and insisted that l!
was “nor the most efficient process."

Transfer student Ali Sargent '10, added that she felt the
process pressured her to “run to the next professor with no time
to talk or discuss classes."

Willis maintained that the lottery is the fairest system avail-
able, but added that “it would be good to do more planning,”

Among rhe idens Willis suggested to improve the registra-
tion process were keeping track of demand for classes and ale
lowing tutorial professors to focus just on their students during
registration. She said that while none ofher ideas had been of
flcially suggested, and may not be feasible, with four out of the
six faculty members on the executive council teaching tutorial
classes this semester, "It is deﬁnitely something we’re talking
about." With hope, these discussions could save firstcycars of
the future from some of the heartache of Harris registration.

Full schedule fosters community for science students

Like all incoming ﬁrst-years, Ravi Chande
'11 entered Harris for registration in a flood of
people, looking to find the classes he wanted
as fast as possible. But unlike most others,
Chande already knew where to go and What to
ask for. This is because Chande arrived about
a week before most other first years to attend
the Grinnell Science Project.

The project looks for first years who are in
underrepresented groups in science, like ethnic
minorities, women and firstegeneration college
students, and invites them to come to Grmnell

a week early. These students spend this extra
orientation participating in activities designed
to build a community and make them feel
comfortable with the academic structure of the
science at Grinnclli

One of the key points stressed by the prOc
gram directors is building community. The
motivation behind this idea is to make these
incoming students combat feelings of exe
clusion from the sciences. Elaine Marzluff,
Chemistry, one ofthe fnculty directors ofGSP,
said, "We really wllnt to bring students in early
and welcome them into this community.”

This community building helps prepare
the students for working with other students
in the classroom setting. “sometimes you ste-
reotypically think ofthe scientist as this loner
working in a lab,” Marzluff said, "but really
scientists do a lot of working together, and
students in the sciences do a lor of working
together is well.”

The program has been successful at err
couraging the students who attend to work in
the sciences. David Lopatto, Psychology, con,
ducted a study that indicated that those who
accepted the invitation to come weie much

more likely to major in a science than those
who turned down their invitations, with GSP
students majoring in a science about 62 per-
cent of the timer

While the program does attempt to increase
the presence of underrepresented groups in the
sciences, the general focus of the program is
still on social aspects and introducing the stu-
dents to life at Grinnell. Chanda described
the experience as "summer cumpcish.”

One of the most popular activities dur»
mg the precorientarion is a scavenger hunt
across campus. “[The point is] to have them
learn where these plnees are on campus," said
Mnrzluff, “but also to do it in a fun way, not
just take them on a tour, so hopefully they’ll
remember it.” The faculty also hold a mock
registration for the GSP students, so that they
are well—piepared for the confusion that many
first-years experience when signing up for
classes.

At night, the students go through Pm,
grams conducted by student assistants, all of
whom did GSF themselves. These assistants
talk to US? students about a variety of issues
related to life at Grinnell. “We do an alcohol
talk, because a lot the students we find haven't
had a lot of encounters with alcohol before,"
said assistant Emily Smith '08.

The students are kept busy hy activities
from early in the morning unril late at night,
making the program seem harder at the time.
Katie Lee ’09 srid, “I ncnmlly didn't really en-
joy GSP while I wrs in ir, but i appreciated it
afterwards," noting that she felt more accus-
tomed to the college than the other students
at NSC.

Jacques Nguyen '10, who wrs an assistant
this year, said the program helpcd him tran-
sirion, since he already had friends at NSO.
“It's kind of nicc not caring alonc in the din-
ing hilll,"hc said, But in trying to describe the
experience, he found hilnselfar n loss. “it's just
an experience you have to go through to uni
del‘stantl,” he said.
