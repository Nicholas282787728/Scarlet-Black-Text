The schedule
aside, the Pioneers
are upbeat, both
about their first—years
and the new oppor-
tunities for the re-
turning players.

“The new guys
aren’t ﬁlling the
roles that were
left, they've been creating new roles,"
said Brown. "Steve and Ken created
their own roles when they came. They
changed the system to ﬁt them, and the
firstryears are doing the same thing,"

“The freshmen class should become
one of the better ones we’ve recruited,”
said Arsencault. “Mike Schmidt is out-
standing and there are four others who
have the potential to be solid players in
our league."

Alongside sehmidt, who Brown
describes as “a shooter and a penetrator.
which we haven’t had in the past," the
team welcomes a ﬁrst—year class that

“It’s kind of the same as last year,
but different because the ﬂoor‘s more
open," said Caitlin Shannon ’07, who
at Sell is the team’s tallest player and
the closest thing the Pioneers have to
a center. “There’s the option to play out
as well as in, [and to] shoot threeepointe
ers. But my position‘s not too different
from other peoples. 1 run the ﬂoor, play
D, set screens, rebound.”

The women's team under Hamil»
ton was a highrscoring bunch to begin
with, consistently putting up scores in
the 605 or 70s and even into the 80s
and ﬁnishing seventh in the nation in
threerpointers for Division III women’s
hoops with seven a game last year. But
this year they’ll be trying to double that
ﬁgure, and with a handful of penetrae
tors,versatile post players, and gunning
shooting guards, they hope they can
ride a tulleeourt press and myriad tour-
guard sets to their second consecutive
trip to the playofTs.

“From a persons
nel standpoint, we
can put one group of
five that is similar to
last year's [in size],
but the second group
of five wouldn't be,"
Hamilton said. “So
we‘re getting coin-
fortablc playing with
four guards all the time."

And yes—cue inevitable and per-
haps unwarranted comparisons to the

fullrcourt press this season. More than
one, actually.

“We’ll push the ball up the ﬂoor
with speed, but on a made or missed
shot, we want to transition to a high—
intensity defense,"I-lumilton said.

How is the team adjusting to the
new style of play?

The team will also be bolstered by
the arrival of multirsport standouts
Trey Raney ’05, Nate Wineinger ‘05,
and Sean Pfalzer ’07, who can start
practicing with the team now that the
football season has come to an end.

Overall, though he’s cautious to
make a strong prediction for this year's
team, Arseneault remains optimistic.

Meanwhile, Burt’s most recent bas-
ketball campaign was very similar to
what her role will be this season,

“My last year [in high school] I
played post, but we played fast because
my team was small,” she said. “It hasn’t
been hard [to adjust].”That's good for

the Pioneers, because Burt is one only

Overall, the team feels comfortable
with the new system, but the players
admit it will be hard to tell how much
progiess they've made until the season
starts.

“It's difficult to tell when we haven't
played games." said Shannon. “We’re
still learning. There are new things we
pick up every time we get on the ﬂoor.
It’ll tell when we start playing games.
Ask me on Sunday and I can give n bet-

“All the players have readily aoeepte
ed the up-tempo style," said Hamilton.
“They’ve shown a good understanding
of using it, In my estimation, what will
bring success is how well we're able to
transition from offense to defense."

So far, Hamilton said, the team has
adjusted well to the new style of play,
but. he added, that’s to be expected.

“After all. I do have the smartest
women’s team in America;Y he said.
