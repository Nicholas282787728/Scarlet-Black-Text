May I l, 2007

From Hoops to Hurricanes

D L. stevcns took a breath and broke the
news;
“Grinncll was actually my second choice."
in high school, the University ofMlam'i was
' Steven‘s number one choice for an under-
graduate programrumil he learned that he
would be dealing with szok a year in loans
and would have to be constantly work
ing at home and school ,
throughout the year to
pay thorn off. Instead, he

a Tnistee scholarship that
covcrcd most oflils costs. He said has
glad that things happened the way they did.

“I've always been interested in mctcarol»
ogyf' Sﬂld Stevens. Grit-mall docsn't have n
meteorology program like Miami's, out the
weather in lowa has excited him and kept his
interest in (h: sciencc alive. “I've been her: for
a few summers and seen the power of thun-
dctswtms we gst.” he said Stcvcns also feels
that it has been good for him to focus on a
liberal arts education. “Simply being here
gave me a chance to step back and feel my
way around instead of being pushed to 5pc»
cialiae in something,"he said.

As a General science/Math major, ste-
vens has prepared himselt to study meteorols

at Iowa State nCKI yeat, although he has
not finished the application process yet. It
will probably take him three years in graduate
school to earn a meteorology degree. Stevens
hopes to get a job analyzing and researching
weather patterns and storms after graduate
school.

in the typical “where
the hell are the trendy
clubs and Trader Joe’s”
way—Grinnell is 12
times bigger than his »
miniseule hometown -
of Vernon, FL. Stun

“P

way. "There
hasn't a lot of
cohesion,"he said.

Stevens discovered
that there were major
dilterences between ,

Grinnell, a not-so-

small small town and

Vernon,a truly humble

hamlet of less than 300 people locatcd an
hour away from a decent movie theater. “It’s
a completely different atmosphem," he said.
"There is a strong sense ofcommunity within
the town and on campus." Stevens arrived at
Grinnell just 17 years old, younger than most
others, It was a shock to be constantly sur
rounded by other students after growing up
in such a rural area. "Living in thnncll has
hccu my ﬁrst chance to really live at all. I'm
still getting used to actually having a social
life,” he said.

A major part ofStcvcn's social life has let
volvcd around athletics. He has played fonts
ball for four years and baseball for a year, He
has also been on an intramural basketball
team for four years. Athletes are a minority at
Gtinnclls but the number ofstudcnl athletes

has increased over the last couple or years,
winch stcvcns believes has led to an interest
ing change orattitude towards athletes.

“Wlicn 1 ﬁrst came, people would gener-
ally look at athletes, say'Oh, you're an athlete,’
and give a dirty look," he said. “Now things
[are] polar. ityou know an athlete, either you
love them to death or you hate them."

Years alter being ﬁnished with Iowa state,
stcvcns hopes to be driving a Mercedes while
chasing twistcrs in Kansas,orworkiag for tho
Weather Channel in Allanm.

But he doesn‘t want to just read a tcles
prompter and put on a checry face (or the
masses—he plans to "work behind the scenes
with computers, and he the guy who tcttllyv
knows what he's doing."
