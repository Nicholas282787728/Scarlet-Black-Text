dining,ouc outside the north marketplacemne outside the south

Candidates sound off on poverty

BY JORDAN LEviNE & MATT HoROWITz

Republican State Representative Danny Carroll and his
Demociatic opponent Eric Palmer have disagrecds about a lot
ofissues over the past two electrons But for one hourTuesday
night, everything came down to one issue—poverty

Midrlowa Community Action (MICA), a nonprofit group
that addresses poverty in Poweslnek and surrounding counties,
hosted a candidate foittm at the Old Glove FactoryTucsday for
several candidates, including Carroll and Palmer,

The two carrdidsres both believe that poverty is a major iSr
sue facing both their district and the
state, but disagree about how the state
government should address it.

They clashed over Carroll’s sup-
port of rcccniﬂnd blpﬂrtisﬂiiimx
cuts for wealthy lowa seniors, Carroll
said that the tax cuts were designed
to keep wealthy citizens in the state.

“You'd like to keep those folks here
and tax their money," Carroll said
"They also take a lot with them her
sides their tax dollars .. .You’d be sur-
prised by the help that elderly citizens
and retired people give to IOWrinComc families."

Palmer said that money should have been spent on educm
tion and health care. “The tax cuts took away the opportu-
nity the state had to fully fund reliable growth in Iowa,”hc said.
“I don't think people are leaving Iowa in droves because of [axir
tion, 1 think they go to Arizona and Texas because its warm,"

In one notable development, both candidates endorsed an

they wanted to participate.

Adam Brumcr ’07 skipped classes on both Wednesday and
Thursday in order to participate in the effort.

“I don’t know Paul at all, but Grinncll has a really strong
sense of community, and one of the things I’ve learned is that

increase in the minimum wage. P01 Palmer, this was norhing
new. “I think we’ve got to set out priorities: help for people
who’re working hard," Palmer said, echoing a campaign theme,
Carroll, in contrast, has voted against several minimum
wage increases in recent years on Tuesday. Carroll surprised
many by announcing that he agreed with his opponent. “I think
a place to start is by increasing the minimum wage,” he said.
Contacted the next day, Carroll afﬁrmed that this was
a change of position. He also said minimum wage increases
should be accompanied by loosening business regulations,
Much of the night was devoted
to discussions of particular welfare
programs. Many or town's 200,000
lowdnconie households have difﬁ’
cuhy paying heating bills. The fed—
eral Low-income Home Energy As»
sistance Program (LIHEAP) helps
to defray that cost, but doesn't go far
enough for many households. Both
Carroll and Palmer agreed that the
state does not provide enough LI»
HEAP money Palmer said rhe fed
eral government needed to raise its
LIHEAP ﬁlnding,but until then, the state could step in.
Carroll said that state LIHEAP funding was important, but
the money should be acquired by cutting other welfare pro»
gmms he labeled “duplication."
Carroll concluded his remarks by emphasizing education
and taking a dig at Palmer for opposing the tax cut for senior
citizens. Palmerjust appealed for the audience’s support.

“I hope you are okay," said Brumer. “We are all thinking
