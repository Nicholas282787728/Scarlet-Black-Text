LAE faces
cutbacks

Student musical ensemble
loses practice time, space
to growing jazz program

iiv STEPHANIE NORDSTROM

The Emu Early Music Room was dark,
and the walls vibrated with voices, percussion
and guitar. A professor and 14 snidents were
in the room, and everyone was singing, danc-
ing or playing an instrument. Latin American
Ensembles Thursday night tchcalsal was well
under way and only halfway done.

But next year, the ensemble’s practice time
will be cut in half. making practices like this
one impossible. The ensemble, a onercredit
course, began in 2001 as part are tcnurCrtrack
full-time position in Latin American Stud-
ies, but the professor in that position left {our
years ago.

Gabriel Espinosa of Central College has
directed the ensemble four hours a week for
the past four years since the departure of the
original professor. “It was working great, he-
eause we had time to ensemble, pieee by piece,"
he said. “It’s going to hurt." '

One reason {or the cutback is to accomr
modate the Jazz Band, which will become a
full-time ensemble in order to make the most
ofthe recent addition ofa fullrtime jazz pm,
tessor to the faculty.

“Mostly, the rationale is that there is no
tenure track full-time position associated with
it," said Eugene Ganb, Music.

“one or the things about Latin Ameri-
can Ensemble is that it's growing quite a hit,"
Brent Shadel ’08, a member of the ensemble,
said. “And the same thing is happening with
the Jazz Band,which is why
we’re beginning to compete
for space."

there are not enough prac-

ensembles to be full-time.
“It’s not any sort of puni-

vocalists." Alex Conlon '09,
a member of the ensemble,
said. “It's the only ensemble
on campus that has that setup,
that has that venue."

Shadel, who composed one
or the pieces that the ensemble
performed last semester, also
stressed the opportunities that
the Latin American Ensemble
provides to students. “1 think
irthere could be a compromise
it’d be great," he said. “I think

both ensembles would beneﬁt from getting

that much time."

Possibly, an expanded Jazz Band will ﬁll
some or the musical void left open by a half-
time Ensemble.“Our hope is that some mem-
bers of Latin American Ensemble, like the
jazz vocalists, might ﬁnd a place in jazz Band,"
said Gaub. He also said that thejazz Band will
“hopefully incorporate AfrorCuban rhythm,
so that some of the Latin American Ensemr
ble’s ethnic music will still be represented.

But tight spaces still mean that the Latin
American Ensemble will become a halfrtime
ensemble nextyear,

“I'm begging for timc,"said Espinosa,“be
cause the ensemble deserves this. I'm willin
to move the day, and I'm willing to move the

The Latin American Ensemble is per-
forming in sebring—Lewis Hall at 7:30 pm.
on April 19. They invite all members or the
campus community to attend.

New ways to spice up a classic breakfast dish

BREAKFAST! In honor ofihe many glorious mornings I’ve woken up with nine other Grinnellians on Alternative Break trips and started the day come
mensally around a camping stove, this week’s recipe is dedicated to that deity of breakfast foods—oatmeal. It’s super easy to prepare a bowl of awesome
oatmeal in the dorms, especially if you’re willing to shell out a few dollars for an investment in Tupperwarettype containers and keep them siocked with

your favorite mixtins,

Directions:

To make the oatmeal,just throw a half cup of rolled oats (none of this “quiclboats”
crap) in a microwave-safe bowl with a haircup to 1 cup otwatcr (depending on how soupy
or thick you like your oatmeal) and microwave for about 2 minutes. (Microwave time will
dependron the power of your microwave; you’ll have to experiment a bit to and the ideal
amount of time.) Once it’s out of the microwave, add in some funky combinations of the
