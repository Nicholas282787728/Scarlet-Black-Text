Lidtka speaks on election issues

School board member recently voted out of office defends his views on issues of evolution and sexual orientation

To the students of Grinnell College:

It has been 10 days since the election and it has become
clear that there were two issues that seem to have motivated
the campus to vote in the local school board election: cvolue
tion and sexual orientation, I have decided to write a short
letter addressing both issues.

Evolution starts out saying that billions of years ago there
was rock, and rains came and eroded clcmcuts off the rock
until a primordial soup was made, and then lightning struck,
and there was life. SCicncc has advanced and found that life
even at the smallest level is intiicate and complex.

In fact, the probability otjust one protein molecule tans
domly falling together is one in ten with 125 zeroes after it,
which is statistically impossible. It has also been theorized
that there were chemical attractions to form that first cell, but
this idea has also been fl'LIlllESSi

Darwin says rhut the first cell mutated its way out ofrhe
soup and that this mutation continued to the point of every-
thing we see today It only stands to reason that we would
see all kinds of transitional creatures in the fossil record, but
there aie none. Darwinists point to microevolution, which is
variation within a species, as proof for macroevolution, how-
over there is no example observed otao animal changing into
a fundamentally different animal,

Here are 12 questions to start out asking about evolution:

Lthrc did the space for the universe come flora?

2.thre did matter come from>

3. Where did the laws of the universe come froni(gravity,
inertia, theiinodynamics, etc)?

4, How did matter get so perfectly organized?

s. Vthre did the energy come from to do all the organiz-
in ’

g6.Vthn, where, whyand how did lite come from nonrlivr

lug matter>

7. Wlicn, whore, why and how did lifc
lcarn to repioducc itself?

8. Vl’ith what did the first cell capable
ofscxual reproduction reproduce?

the genetic code) cieate any new, improved
varieties? (Recombining English letters will
never produce Chinese books.)

10. Natural sclcction only works with the genetic lnfol’mn'
tion available and lends only to keep a species stable, How
would you explain the increasing complexity in the genetic
code that must have occurcd if evolution were true?

11, Which evolved first (how, and how long, did it work
without the otheis)? The digestive system, the food to be di-
gested, the appetite, the ability to and and eat tlic food, the
digestive juices, or the body's rcsistanco to irs'own digestive
juice (stomach, intestines, ere)?

12.1s it possible that similarities in design between differ-
ent animals prove that they had a common designer instead
of a common ancestor?

Our DNA is basically a set ofinstructions telling the cell
how to constiuct proteins-much like the software needed to
run a computer. Bill Gates has said “DNA is like a software
program only much more complex than anything ever dee
vised."

Each human cell contains 13’ofDNA packed into a nucle-
us only SOOOths ofa mm across. It contains
as much information as the Encyclopedia
Britannicaiall 30 \volumcs73e4x over.

Does that sound like iandom chance or
intelligent dcsigu.> Why not have an intel‘
ligcnr discussion or the evidence for both
thcorics rather than the censure that occurs
now?

I disagreed with putting sexual orienta-
tion in policy because:

1. Iowa law does not rcquuc it.

2. 96 percent ofthe state districts do not include it.

3. It is an unhealthy behavior, for example, anal intercourse
increases the risk by 1000 percent over a heterosexual counr
terpirt of getting AIDS. There are emotional issues and a
shortened life span onOeSO years.

4. The compassionate thing to do is to help these folks to
get out ofthis behavior, not enable it.

students, you have come to Grinnell College to learn and
advance. Please do so with an open mind.

Gender-neutral housing a sensible idea

Self-governance and other Grinnell policies concerning gender should be considered when handling housing issue

The recent S or B article on gender-neu-
tral housing proposals brought to my mind
an oddity in the way Grinnell approaches the
issue of gender and living space.

We (students and administrators alike)
accept without question
that if you have an “orthor
dor” gender identity, you
can only room with some-
one orthc same gender,

Today, this and other
residential colleges are al-
most the only communities
left in the United States in
which unmarried adult men and women are
forbidden to live together as loominatcs.

It’s strange to think ofGrinncll as an ens
clavc of social conservatism, but in this one
matter, that’s what we are.

Since I don't like unexamined conseiva-

we are,

ll’s strange in [Ill/7k afGnnncl/ as
an enclave altar/bl conservaiixm,
burin lhis one mailer, that’s what

tism, I have been trying to think of reasons
why such a restriction would be either cons
sistent with other Grinnell College policies
or generally advisable at Grinnell.

Regarding the ﬁrst question. it's clear
that forbidding females
and males to room togeth—
ei is strikingly inconsistent
with other College house
ing policies: we give them
the option ofsharing their
bathrooms but not their
slccping rooms.

We also allow students
to visit other students’ rooms icgardless of
gendei, with the curious result that you can
stay in the room otsomcone orthe opposite
gender provided you don't live there.

(The Handbook cryptically suggests that
ball governments have the powei to restrict

“coeducational visitation" to certain hours of
the day; I have lived in three different dorm
ﬂoors, one of them singlerscx, and never
heard orrhis being done. In any event, that
possibility is itself only an
outgrowth of the general
same-gender rooming pols
icrl

As to whether the poli-
cy is gsncrally advisable, it's
easy to think of situations
in which it would he a bad
idea for male and female
students to room together.

Fol example, they could be in a relations
ship (what irthcybreak up?) oi the male could
be smelly (all too often Iruc,1’m afraid).

But. speaking scriously, I can't think of
any such situations that would not also occur
with same-gender roommate pairs.

[ll/75 potential for people 1‘0 make
misinkes i5 norin llSE’lfﬂ very good
reason to lake away [he apiion,

especially under sell-governance

Furthermore, the potential for people to
make mistakes is not in itselfa very good rea-
son to take away the option, especially under
a philosophy of selfegovernance.

In a way, though, it's
inappropriate to talk about
taking away the option,
since the option has never
yet existed.

And since we are now
seriously considering an
option in which we throw
out the very concept of
gender, it’s clear to me that
the only reason we still unquestioningly insist
on a samcrgondsr rooming policy is that it's
always been done that way, andifor all our
liberalism—no “traditionally—gcndered" stu—
dcnts seem to mind it,

rants

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds. In
142 words or less,
and you’re invit-
ed! If you have a
rant, e—mail it to

complaining in
a public forum
is always more
fun that doing it
alone

Pits and dragons

As runny ofynu may have noticed. Grinnell Col~
lege is sutrcring a severe lack of dragons I haven’t
seen hide nor horn or one since my rusr lillenightei'
freshman year, With winter approaching, I bclicvc
that the administration should seriously consider the
beneﬁts (okay maybe dangers) ofhaving arc-breath-
ing creatures on campus. Also, I think that rich pro-
spcctivc students would be quite impressed by the
sight of dragon sleeping near any of the oldrschool
buildings like Gates tower. They're pretty, they‘re hot,
they fly and Carleton is getting one. Their scaicity
on our campus is just unacceptable. Since 1 have 42
words left, could people please close the cereal cone
tainers in Cowles so that I don't have to eat stale
Lucky Charms? Thanks.

Ours are bigger than yours

You know what] love? I love the abundance ofcups
at Cowles dining hall. And not just any cups, but big
cups. Cups that hold more man one gulp nfyour re-
frcshnicnt of choice.

You know what makes it even better? My knowle
edge that those unfoitunate masses in Quad cannot en—
joy this privilegeThat's right we have your cups. All
ofrhcm, Nowyou have to make (our trips to the Coke
machine to kill the same amount of Colombian union
leaders that] can kill with one glass. Sometimes,1 take
extra big Cups on my tiny and let them sit there empty.
I do this because I can, and because I am a spiteful hu-
man being. Ha ha hal Now go awry. And while you’rc
up, could you reﬁll my chocolate milk?
