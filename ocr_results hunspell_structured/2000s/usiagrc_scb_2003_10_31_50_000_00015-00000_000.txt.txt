Howard Dean

misrepresented

In a retentsm article GiantWoodaid accused Governor Howaid
Dean era state's rights ”cop out" on civil unions. In fact Dean's
views on civil union represent a balanced approach to the issue. states
can choose whether to have civil unions or gay marriage, but they
must have equal rights rot ull titiiens gay orstrtight. in 2000 Howard
Dean signed a civil union hill ranermont. WhileWashington poli.
rieians, like John Kerry. want to talk about gay rights, Dean has done
more rot gay couples than any other politician.

Mr. Woodard also compared Dean to former Republican Some
tot strom Thurmond. First, the Democratic establishment tried to
paint Dean as too liheial to
win and euntpaied him to
Mondale and McGovern.
Then they called him a cone
servative and compared
him to Newt Gingrich,
People did not buy that cit
ther. And now they're try.
ing to compare hint to
Thiirniond- The truth is
Dean is Dean and Wash
ington politieians iii-e hav.
ing trouble with this raet heeause they doirt know how to defeat the
former Veiinoiii Governor

A more apt eomparison is between Kerry and Tliunnond. Dc-
spite Kerry’s criticism or the Iraq war he voted with Tlnitmond to
authorize the use or rotee in Iraq Kerry has also criticized the
administration's handling oreivil liberties, but he voted with strom
Thurmond rot the Patnot Aer. Keri-y criticizes president Bush rot
not rully runding the No child Left Behind Aet, but he, alongwith
Thurmond, voted for that bill. There's a reason that Dean is build»
ingavolunreerarmy, with nearlyhalrora million supporteis, and it’s
berause Dean is a straight shooter. While the politicians in wash.
ington may have trouble understanding this coueepr, people still
appreeiate those who are willing to back up their rhetorie with ac
tion.

Mri Woodard also com»
pared Dean to [S]trom
Thurmond A more apt
comparison is between
Kerry and Thurmond.

want to pass on that he told me that he is NOT implying that art is
a useless exercise made out orttash that costs a lot ormoney, and thus
equating social instice with the (rash Let me suggest a few odter
ways orlooking at Pat Dougherty’s sculpture and Michael Anderson's
comments,

Dougherty used inateritls gathered at CERA (Canard environ.
mental Research Area). These were willow and dogwood saplings,
and elm trees that had to be eliminated anyway from the prairie,
since they are invasive species in that environment, They cost noth.
ing to use and provided a service to the starraud scientists who use
CERAwhen wc hauled them away. They also provided a nice oppore
tunity ror interdepartmental cooperation between seientc and art.

Yes, we paid Daugherty to create the scuiplure. This is part or
the social yusrice that Mr. Andersen indicates crinnell College sup.
ports. iran institution like the Faulconercallery doesn't support art,
we are really ignoring our social responsibility. Artists can’t work for
free Their standaid or living is, in general, low, and if they don’t
teach, they rarely get health care When the economy tanks, they
don't sell work

we also rid a number orother people to create Hm nit/s (rho
sculpture). We paid the students who wanted to work on it, When
we didn't get enough students, we hired two men item the loeal
temporary agency, One orthena worltcd steadily wirh us for three
weeks, thus having the chaiiee to worlt with a nationally known artist
and mike a daily wage He was very happy with the experience.

aniiy, l should note that Hot Trish is part onions rifle-nether. an
exhibition in the Fauiconcl Gallery and t community partnership
that is all about the issues racing the contemporary Midwest (includ.
ing things like dwindling funding and the eireets that has on small
towns). we have created works or art in the eommunity, and are

access, we have involved rarmers. religious leaders, local businesses.
and the city orcrinnell in the projch we have spent money in all

Art and social justice are not antithetieal, just as Grinncll College

many ways as we ean is the best way to insure the health orboth town

Rant focus

I am impressed by the amount orletters and outrage expressed
over Norman Perlmutter's Co. to, 2003 random rant. The letters
treat Mr. Perlmutters words as ir they were Written to he purpose-
