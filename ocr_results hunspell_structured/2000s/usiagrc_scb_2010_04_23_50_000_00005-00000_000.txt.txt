Faulconer Outreach Program brings together kids, art

Program brings children’s work to Faulconer Gallery for show at end of summer, connect College and community

Bv MAX CALENBERG

While walking down Park Street on n sunny afternoon,
one might and oneself blinded by a glitter—covered truck.
Yes, disco is still dcﬂt‘liit is Tilly Woodward.

on Wednesday, April 21, Woodward. Curator orAcn-
demie and Public Outreach at the Faulconer Gallery, walks
into the Galaxy Youth Center before any of the children
have urnved. She is cnrrying a 10-foot tube ofpartlally ptr
pier miche’ chicken wire.

“Its for n [Drake] leraly summer reading program,
and their summer reading theme is Make a splnsh so the
idea' is to make a giant sea serpent that Will be part oftheit
progrnin,"woodwnrd said.

Since coming to Grinncll in the fall 2007 \Noodward
has been all around the Grinnell area. bringing art into
the lives of children. Throughout every month Woodward
travels on‘ee to the Galaxy
ementary STARS after-school progrrun, the Arts Council
afterrschool program, the Mayﬂower community Center
and other onertime events.Woodward knows that in order
to create a strong relationship between two separate com—
munities, sometimes one of those parties has to make the
ﬁrst step.

“I think it is really important that if you want people

to come to your place, you have to go to their place and to '

meet their needs as well,” Woodward said. “In my position
as outreach curator one of the goals is to get people from
the community to the Faulconer Gallery and providing ser-
vices in arts education and helping to strengthen existing
programs is 1 really good goal."

Woodward's visits to different children's centers are al—
ways welcome, with the whole experience summed up with
one word by all who participate: “Fun!"

Youth Center, the Davis E11 .

The only complalnt about Woodward regarded the he-
quency with which she comes,“It feels like she only comes
once 1 year, s.1id one 5th grader.

\Vhen she does 30, her efioits pav off greatly, as the
Fnulc'oncr Gallery now hosts events especially for incin-
hers from the Grinnell community

“Once we stirtcd doing this kind or
partner outreach activities, now for his
stance, this siiininei Galaxy and Davis pro—
gram are scheduling a nnnibei of activities
‘thit will go on in the Gnllery" Woodward
said. “I think it’s been effective in getting
people to fecl cointortnhle“

Grinnell is not the first place where
Woodward has established a strong art
presence. Berorc coming to Grinnell she
was the founding director of the Fella
Community Art Center, in Pella, IA a pro-
grnm that served 17,000 individuals annu-
ally. Additionally. she taught Art Education and ran the
gallery at Central College in Fella.

Director of the Galaxy Youth Center, Shannon Mc-
Naul, believes that without Woodward, her center’s arts
and crafts activities would be much less enriching.

"She has always worked with kids in every CommUr
nity," Manul said.“1‘ll give Tilly all the credit because
she is the mastermind behind all of this." .

McNaul has noticed a special talent of Woodward’s
that may just be the reason for all ofher success.

“Tilly has been able to get kids who we can’t get on
gaged in things, Mchul said. "You’ll get your hardestr
core kid down here and all the sudden he is making a
pirate outfit."

”Everybody SilOU/(l see What My
does with kids, She’s amazing.”

Shannon MtNaul
Director, Galaxy/Youth Center

Due to her amiable nature, Woodward has been infar
rnous among the Grinnell youth, even coming a nickname.

“[The kids] love Tilly, everybody loves her, said Woodr
wal'd’s Intern Caitlin Detltscli '12. “At middle school she
doesn't do outreach there, but they still know her as Glitter
Truck Lady. Everybody knows who slit:
is and they are excited about the College
bringing outreach itctivities.’

Now that school is Winding, down
McNaul is ge1riug up for .i busy” summer
that will end with a showing of all of the
kids' work in thc Faulconer Gallery,

“[The kids] get to bring out their
mothers, their fathers, their grandpar»
ents, their friends, their aunts and un-
cles," MeNaul said. “It is an awesome
time to get the community to see what
Tilly docs and to get our kids involved
and to get them to have an appreciation
for art and to see that art isn't something that just hangs
on a wall."

It is clear Woodward’s efforts have made a huge differ»
ence in the past three years. Considering the U5. is a na-
tion where arts education is continually the ﬁrst curriculum
eliminated due to budget cuts, it is great to see Grinell Col-
lege sharing its resources with the surrounding community.
McNaul and her kids are very thankful.

“Working with the College, especially with Tilly, it is
such a great experience for the community," McNaul said.
“Everybody should see whatTilly does with kids. She's just
amazing."
