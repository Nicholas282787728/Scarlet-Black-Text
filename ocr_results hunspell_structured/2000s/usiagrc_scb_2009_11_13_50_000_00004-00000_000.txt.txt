Most Grinellians wouldn't conside'r (akt

fall semester practical—unless itwrts for social
justice.

A group of students will head to Fort
Benning, Ga. to participate in the School
of Americas/Western Hemisphere Institute
for Security Cooperation(SOA/VVINSEC)
annual protest starting Nov, 19. The SOA
protest is considered one or the largest ans

aims to shutdown the School
of Ainericris/ Western Hemi-
sphere Institute for Security
Cooperation, a military train-
ing institute funded by the
United States government
that has the unfortunate his

for organizing the trip this year.

“Grinnclltins fm tnnny years have felt
that it's unportnnt thnt we hnve our voice
heard in that call to close down the school,"
BotrMillcr siid. “That's why we're going
down there."

other participants in the organized pro-
test, such as Evan Hunsley ’11, are going in
order to more smclcntly utilize how their tax
dollars tire spent. Hunsley has been going on

the SOA/ WlNSEC trip since his ﬁrstyeat,
back when the trip did not have n chntler
bus and students drove down in shifts with
personally-owned ones.

"I think it’s a really important ‘cause bet
cause n lot political attention in the United
States is given to domestic issues. But a lot
orpeople, even on the American left, tend to
ignore the fact that our economic and Inlll‘
(’(u'y policies are still resulting in the deaths
and tortures and kidnappings and rripes and
murders ofthousancls orpeo-
ple around the world,“ Hun-
sley said. “[It's a] direct result

dollars To me, that's the
most crucial American pohey
to change."
