Fire breaks out in Younker

Water causes most signiﬁcant damage to room below the site of the ﬁre

av DAVID KENNEDY

At 11:48 am. on Tuesday, Security received two telephone
calls reporting, “ﬂames in a second ﬂoorwindow"aiid “curtains
on fire"in Younker. The fire that broke out on the second ﬂoor
onounker Hall South resulted in no serious injuries, but it did
damage college and student property

As the ﬁre alarm rang and students gathered outside, Secue
rity personnel ascended the stairs to the second floor.

The fire started in the room of Brigham Hoegh ‘08 and
Laura Burton ‘08. Upon opening the door, Director of Secur
rity Steve Briscoe and another security ofﬁcer suffered from
smoke inhalation, and there was almost no visibility in the
room. “When I saw the room it wasjust black," said Briscoe. “I
couldn't see in there, and there was just too
much smoke."

At this point, Security officers didn’t
know if students were trapped in the blaze.
"It was very tense because the room seemed
to be fully engulfed in smoke, and nobody
could see anybody and nobody could get in
there because ofthe smoke” said Eriscoe.

Shortly thereafter, the Grinnell Police
and Fire Departments arrived with three fire
engines, two police cars, and an ambulance.

Younker's sprinkler system was deactivated, and Grinnell
Fire Chief Dan Sicard entered the room wearing an oxygen
mask and conﬁrmed that no one was inside the room. He then
broke open the window to ventilate the room while ﬁreﬁghters
carried their hose into the building and extinguished the tire,
which had been contained by the sprinkler system.

The Gtinnell Fire Department conﬁrmed Thursday morn-
ing that the ﬂame ofa burning candle left near the window
reached the curtains and started the ﬁre.

Hocgh said that she and Burton left the room at 11:28 a.m.
to go to lunch and that the candle was on a plastic storage
unit that did not reach the window ledge or the curtains. it is
unclear to Hoegh how the candle caused the ﬁre that melted
the storage unit and the adjacent plastic trash can and lit the
window curtains ablaze.

After the ﬁreﬁghters left the building, Hoegh and Burton
were allowed to enter their room. “Everything was covered in
black soot,” said Hoegh. Burton and Hoegh retrieved their
clothes and other belongings and took their laptop computers
to ITS for damage assessment.

The majority ofdamage to student propertywas not caused

by the ﬁre but by the water sprayed by the sprinkler head in

Burton and Hocgh's room and by the fire department.
sprinkler heads are individually activated by exposure to

heat and can spout water at a rate of 25 gallons per minute.

After the police and ﬁre departments left, Student Affairs
staff blocked the doorways to Younker while Facilities Manage
ment (FM) staﬁ’ replaced the window in Hoegh and Burton’s
room and set up wet Vacuum cleaners to eliminate the water in
the hallways, student rooms and the kitchen in the RLC apart
merit. Security ofﬁcers who had inhaled smoke during the ﬁre
were treated and released by their doctors; Briscoe commented
later that he had only a sore throat. FM allowed students on to
the third ﬂoor and the pit around 2 p.m. and onto the ﬁrst and
second ﬂoors at 4 pm.

Mark Godar, FM director, said the dams
age to Hoegh and Buttons room caused by
the fire was “amazingly light." Hoegh and
Burton were told that renovations to their
room would be completed within a few days;
in the meantime, they are staying in Loose
Hall.

However, Delwin Pinkins ‘06, who lived
directly under the room where the fire broke
out, experienced extensive personal property
damage from water that seeped through Pinkins'ceiling around
the walls ofhis room.

Water saturated Pinkins' computer, television, and other
electronics and waterlogged his bed, futon, and sofa. Pinkins
was told that his parents’ home owner‘s insurance should cover
the damage to his private property. However, Pinkins' mother
lives in Mexico, and Pinkins does not have insurance coverage
of his own. “It’s just mc—l know it’s not going on my home
owner's insurance. It's going on somebody else's," said Pinkins.

Godar stated that Pinkins’ room was the only other room
in Younker that would require extended repair work. A new
drop ceiling will be installed in the room, and Pinkins has been
given temporary housing in Younker North. Pinkins has dea
cided not to allow’ruesdays events to detail him.“Study, study,
study~1’m going to keep my mind offit,"hc said.

Hoegh and Burton wrll not be held ﬁnancially responsible
for damages to other students’ or college property.

Jim Mulholland, assistant treasurer of the college, indi-
cated that it was likely that upon assessment of the damages
to Pinkins' property, “the college will deal with whatever his

‘Hecklers’ of pro-
life group defend
visit to meeting

in DAVID MONTGOMERV

Several prorchoicc Grinnell students who attended the
opening meeting of .i new campus pro-life group defended
their actions Wednesday as non—disruptive and inspired by cw
riosity about the new group. “We felt it was our responsibility
to go,"said GinnTaiullo ‘oo. “lfyou’re curious about a group, go
and see what it's about."

in response to accusations that they had been disruptive,
Tarullo, Amy Malinowski ‘06, and Mary Powell ‘07 conceded
that their presence had derailed the meeting to a certain extent.
According to Malinowski, “Our very presence was taken as a
threat." She said that the meeting leaders,Mary Nesbit‘07 and
Cathy Geddes ‘07, seemed unprepared to deal with rhe trio.

“1 think it's obvious that we’d be unprepared," responded
Ncsbit, when asked about her and Geddes’ preparedness. “At
the first meeting, that‘s completely understandable. That was
when we were ﬁguring out what we were about."

The three prevchoice students said that they declared
themselves openly at the beginning of the meeting, and that
things seemed to go well at ﬁrst. At a certain point in the meet
ing, however, Powell asked what the mission statement of the
pro»life group was. The group did not, at that point, have one.
“We were filling out our form to apply to be an official SGA
group at that meeting,"
said Nesbit. coming up
with a mission statement
is part ofthe SGA applir
cation form.

Malinowksi said that
the trio offered construct
tive comments about pos-
sible mission statements,
and Geddes agreed, but
qualiﬁed. “Sometimes it
seemed almost antago—
nizingl understand that they wanted us to have a clear mis—
sion, but we didn’t."

Taruilo felt that the pro-choice visitors were not responsible
for any problems at the meeting. "Ifyou’re going to be offended
by people who disagree with you at your first meeting, especialr
1y ityou're addressing such a controversial topic, you shouldn't
advertise it as an open meeting,”she said.

Powell agreed with Tarullo, but said that she was not aware
that this was the group’s ﬁrst meeting. “It wasn’t our intent to be
disruptive," she said. "We didn’t talk about abortion at all. We
werejust curious about the group."

According to Geddes, some or the people who identified
themselves as prorchoice were very respectful and asked in-
formative questions. However, several others "didn't feel cone
struetlve with the way they formed their questions. Itjust didn’t
seem respectfulThe group was polarized, and there was some
back-and-forth."

Despite their political differences, the three pro~choice smr
dents don’t feel that the probe group itself is the issue. All
three agreed that the group had every right to be here at Grins
nell, and insisted that they went to the meeting with a great
deal of respect. What they object to is how their visit was re-
ceived.

Another complaint of Geddes and Nesbit was that some of
the signs they had put up to advertise their meeting had been
vandalized.Tarullo said that none of them had anything to do
with the vandalism, and condemned the action. “We agree that
writing on the signs was completely wrong," she said.

Tarullo, Powell and Malinowski said that they don’t have
plans to visit any future meetings ofthe pro-life group.'l‘hey do,
however, intend to attend events such as speakers and debates
sponsored by the pro-life group.

Both proelifers and pto-choicers present at the group’s
first meeting said they welcomed greater debate on an issue
on which many Grinnellians seem to share similar views. “It's
good that they’re here," said Malinowski. “Grinnell can get a
little one—sided at times."

Powell agreed. “Let's face it," she said. “The real world is
not like Gtinnell."

“It wasn’t our intent
to be disruptive. We
didn‘t talk about abor-
tion at all. We were
just curious about the
group.”
