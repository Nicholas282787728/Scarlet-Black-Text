Grinnell’s swimming and diving teams sweep the MWC championships for the first time in eight years

During warm—ups at the Midwest Conference swim»
ming and diving championships last weekend, host
lawrence University played the Foundations “Build Me
Up Buttercup" over its pool’s public address system. The
track ha become something ofa ﬁght song for the Grin-
nell mens and women’s teams this semen, and the Pio-
neers took adwntage ofit.

“All of the sudden. the entire team was swaying to
gether in a circle, singing and dancing," Emma samueIs
'04 said, “We made a spectacle of ourselves,”

lawrence was kind enough to play the song one more
time for the Pioneers at the event: right after Gllnnell won
both the men's and women’s conference championships.

Thi: dual win for the Pioneers mark: the ﬁrst time in
eight years Grinnell has won both titles and the ﬁrst time
in head coach Erin Hurley's tenure (II’M' both teams have
held titles at once.

“This feels really good," Hurley said. ”It's n culmina-
tion ofa fantastic season. It couldn't have happened in a
better way."

Close call

The perfect season almost didn‘t happen for the men's
team. thnnoll trailed Lawrence by ﬁve points at the
end of day two. and the meet was close enough through
out the ﬁnal day that diver Eric Blevins ’04 swam the
ZUCryaid backstroke to get the five points awarded for
ﬁnishing lzth,

Going into the ﬁnal two events ofthe meet, the Pier
necrs led Lawrence by only a point. but four (opeclghr ﬁn.
ishes in the 200-yard butterﬂy and a third—place ﬁnish in
the don—yard freestyle secured the title for the men. The
Pioneers topped Lawrence by 14 points, the closest men's
ﬁnish in conference history.

“We knew coming into the third day that we had a
good shot, but that it would be really dose,” Hurley said.
“Because it was so close, every single competition, every
single person was so key."

The Pioneers did indeed get key performances from
almost cvcrysingle person. Grinnellwon 10 ofthe 20 men's
events at the meet, including three of the ﬁvc relays, and
22 Pioneers ﬁnished in die top ﬁve in at least one event.

The close ﬁnal score came more from personnel prob—
lems than performance troubles for Grinnell.The Pioneers
had only one male diver. Blevins, competing at the meet.
Although Blevinswon both the oneemeterantl th - - meter
boards, Lawrence plated three divers in the top SIX in each

i ttl

event and thus gained a total OHS polnﬁ on Gilnnell.

The Pioneers made up poinrs lost on the diving board
in the pool. Brett McMilllan '05 ﬁnished ﬁrst in three
events. the ZOO-yard individual medley. the loo butterfly
and the 200 backstroke. Gene Pcteisen '05 ﬁnished ﬁrst In
the 100 b:d<sttoke,.1nd (Drﬁphln Todd Kimball '02 ended
second in the 100»yatd breaststroke.

Despite the standouts, swimmers said the close win
was a team effort.

“Individually, there were many who stood out, but it
was a team effort that pulled us through." Blevins said. “If
one person didn’t swim who swam at conference, we prob-
ably would have lost."

McMillian said the win at cone
feicnce was especially ﬁtting,

“it was the perfect end to a pore
(act season," he snid. “We blew eve
eryone away inestason, and we {ole
lowed through with avieroryat cone
fcrence. I’ve never been on a team
that has won such a big title, I hope
to get used to it over the next three
years."

For Kimball, the win was an especially nice way to end
his Grin uell swimming career.

“My freshman year. the women broke a long chample
onsliip drought [winning conference in 1999}, andwewcm
all really excited for them, but once they started obliterate
ing the conference on a yearly basis, we got a bit jealous."
he stud. “It’s nice to be in the pool at the and ofth: meet
becausc you are a champion and not just because you’re
going to the same school as a champion,"

Blowout

As close as the men's race was, the women's was just the
opposite, Claiming their fourth ch title in four years,
the Pioneers downed runner-up Lawrence by almost 300
polntsithc largest margin of victory in conference his-
tory,

“I don't want to sound overconfident, but point-wise,
ifwe liteially didn’t show up to the third day, we might
have lost." Hurley said. "I malt figure out any other way
we would have lost,"

The Pioneers led the race From the first event. when
Susan Hughes '02, Rachel Sellon ’04,]enn Helm '04 and
Emmn‘Sttmucls ’04 teamed up to win the 200de freestyle
relay with n time that just missed the school record, The
Grinnell women went on to win all ﬁve relay events at the
meet.

”This feels really good. It’s
a culmination of a fantas-
tic season. It couldn’t have
happened in a better way.”

—Head coach En'n Hurley

"3: s

W A.” 7‘

Sellon broke the conference record in the ZOO—yard
butterfly and also defended her titles in the zoo. and 400-
yard individual medeys, winning the latter by almost l0
seconds.

samuels added another Pioneer victory in the loo
freestyle, and stacic Kossoy '05 got her first conference
title in the zoocyard backstroke. Holm and Amber
Gedlinske '04 ﬁnished onevtwo in the lost) freestyle for
the second year in a tow.

Scllon said that it was not her individual performances
that made the championships spccial, but instead the suc.
cess ofborh teams.

“Having both menand women
win the championship was awe»
some," she said, “Evelyone was so
pumped up all weekend. and evcly»
thing we had been woiking on came
together for a great cnd to the sea
son.

Ho nors

The two titles were not the only
awards the Pioneer tcams took back
to Grinnell with them. Hurley was named MWC coach of
the year at the meet. and Sellon was named female swim-
mer ofthe VE

Hurley . id lier award was liardlyau individual accom—
plishmcnt, highlighting the contributions of the entire
Gunnell assistant coaching staff.

“It’s really a tribute to our coachinv staff," she said. “I
know for a fact that i wouldn’t be able to do my job the
wnyl want to do it witlioiit Jim Randall, Kelly Rose and
lan Bessc. .

“The award is really a team award." l—lurley said,

Scllon, too, dowriplayed the individual opect ofher
award. She said the award was a reflection of all the Mad
Ducks, the team’s selrcappointed nickname.

“Bcing named MWC female swimmer ofthc year was
a great honor," she said. “I was so happy to be able to rep.
resent the Mad Ducks,”

Besides the swimmer of the yen. honor, Sellon also
passed NCAA—Division Ill B cuts in the zoo btiiterfly and
400 individual medley at the mesh She will now wait with
McMillian, who also passed the B cut, to see ifthey are
selected to compete at the national meets in March.
