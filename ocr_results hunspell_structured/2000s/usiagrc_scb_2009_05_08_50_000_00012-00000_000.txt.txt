BLOCK PARTY: A debaucherous tease! It is
by far the best day of the year, but the seven
long days separating us seem like a lifetime

ALL-NIGHTERS: Everything about them is
heinous, and yet they are so unavoidable

The end of the school year will soon be
upon us, and now is the time for the tradi~
tional rehashing of old issues, evaluating
our present status, and making declarations

about How Far We Have Come, Where We
Now Stand, and especially, Where Do We
Go From Here? It may be hackneyed, and it

this time of year.

We at the SSLB have a nasty habit of mak-
ing a huge deal out of events on campus that are
largely one—dimensional so it cames as i surprise
to me that Osgood’s letter of resignation was not
at the top of our priority totem this week. Since
Osgood already outlined the main points or the
“story" in u letter. a lerrer that he sent to the
entire campus that is available on the Internet
where everyone in the whole world crn Access it
RIGHT NOW, it makes sense that our article
detailing his resig'l'llltion is only 500 words In
addition to the letter, the Trustees drnflcd rule
other letter plus a «solution. Both of these are

. also available unlinc. lnsrosd ofwriting a huge

smty that is unnccossrnly long, really redundant
and so thoroughly researched it's actually hilari-
ous, we, for once, let the letter, the other letter,
and tho resolution, speak for thomsclyrs. Bravo.

Hey Rabbis, clean your mess!

Dear Robot Party People who came to tho
Brande Party in your costumes,

Thanks for coming to the Worst Potty Ever
to show oft” your homemade gc' Not only did
we admire your emfry skills, but u tlso wore an-
vious of the fact that you were invltcd to such a
sweet party when we were not. If only we had
such cool friends. “It also wanted to drink you
for leaving your costumes behind for us to clrsn
up the out day in no loss than n hslmozon trips
to tho dumpster. We knew we were throwing the
Worst Parry Ever, but we did not know we were
hosting an oppormnity for trmsformers to spew
their wreckage everywhere. cht time, be kind,
rewind, and take your tin foil habit back where it
came from.

Yours truly,

The Brande
