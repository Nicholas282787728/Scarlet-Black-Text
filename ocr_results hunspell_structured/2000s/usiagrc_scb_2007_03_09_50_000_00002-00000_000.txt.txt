Recycling improves, still sub-par

By ARI ANISFELD AND JUSTIN ERIcKsoN

Gl‘lnncll students aren’t used to falling. But evely year,
Grinnell enters Recyclemania, and every year, Giinncll loses.

Recyclcmania is a 10-week nationwide competition among
colleges to see wiucii school can recycle the mostThere are nu.
rnerous categories in which schools can compete, but given its
size. Grinnell College only participates in the per Cilpltit classic
competition. Despite participating in a sizerneutl‘al category,
the college has consistently ranked near the bottom of the colli-
petition.

According to Heidi Conner’09, co-lcader ol’Free the Plan-
et (FTP), Grinncll College's poor showing in the competition
is due to a number of factors, one ofwhich is student ill‘ﬂlhyt

Recycling takes more effort than throwing trash away, its
easier to be lazy .lild thlow everything in the hash than to take
the time to sort through all oryeur goods and place them in the
right bill," she said

Conner also rtlt that the college's poor recycling pcrfors
mancc was largely due to the lack of advertising, winch means
most students are unaware they are even in a competition, “I do
not think the college, on an administrative level, does enough
to promote responsible environmental living, which includes
recycling."

According to Chris Bait, the Environmental Coordinator
for the college, the lack orpi-ornotion was intentional. “This is
the only time we really weigh our rceyeling,..[and we] are eels

these surveys provide an important Way for administrators to
evaluate where improvements are needed on campus

~ one budget was approved fat the Grinnell Grirrins Rugs

Every Dorm Floor" resolution, and tabled the resolution for
another week.

- Representatives from the Housing committee reported
that Cowles students will receive a 5900 compensation from
the school that will be credited to their PrCatcls fol the difr
ﬁculties associated with nearby Construction. The Committee
for Student Life is considering whether (0 move the Commu-

a colisensus. Tile Dining Committee is reluctant to open the

letting data for our total year orrecyclrng, he said. The college
uses the data internally as a leﬂection of the schools typical te-
cycling level. By not advertising the competition more heavily,
the campus ensures it will not have skewed data

For Conner, it is difficult to encourage students to recycle
unless they are predisposed to IL “Recycling is a culture, it’s
a habit, and I think a lot of time, habits [only] change when
someone nags you continuously or gives you the information
or the inspiration to make change in your llft.’ She said the
administration should do more to plomote environmentally
fliendly living among the students.

Conner also said that FTP assumed some responsibility
tor any lack orenvironmentaiisrn on campus but that the final
responsibility falls to the students themselves. “I also think
FTP could do more with recycling but ultimately recycling
is up to every individual, and FTP is not responsible for every
person on campus, she said.

Despite its history of disappointment, this year the college
is improving its restrlts.Tlrrough four weeks ofcornpetition, the
college is ranked 44 out of165 schools, a major improvement
from the last few years. The college is currently below the Unis
versity ol'Minncsotu and above Drew University. According to
Bair,“ivliat is most important is how we have been doing com»
pared to years past." Statistics show the college‘s recycling late
improving and at lecelit count, had recycled over ten pounds
per student.
