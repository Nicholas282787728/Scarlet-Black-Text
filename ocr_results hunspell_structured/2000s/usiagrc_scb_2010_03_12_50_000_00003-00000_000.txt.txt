Last .week the Grinnell College student
body elected next year's Student Government
Association mtccutive cabinet members. Ben
Offenberg ‘11, Graciela Guzman '11 and Lit»
ing Cong ’11 will respectively all the posiv
tions of President, Vice President for Student
Affairs (VPSA) and Vice President for Aca—
demic Affairs (VPAA) for the 2010-2011
academic year.

The three newly elected cabinet members
had their first meeting last weekend to talk
about such basics as cabinet selection

The remaining cabinet positions are
those of Films Chair,.Concerts Chair, Serr
vice Coordinator, Assistant Treasurer and
All Campus Events Coordinator, which
will be selected by the new executives .
“The cabinet is to some extent hierarchical,
but even more than that it’s collaborative,"
Guz‘man said "This should deﬁnitely 'be
continued."

“We will basically keep the procedure
implemented last year and choose the Ad-
minisLmtive Coordinator 1ch ﬁrst,” said
OEenberg, who served as V'PSA this year.
This allows candidates {or Ac to apply for
other positions in time, in case they will not
be chosen as AC. The applications for this
position are due this coming Sunday. But
SGA plans on having their full cabinet by-
April, according to orienbcrg.

While next year’s cabinet is not complete
yet, Guzman, Offenberg and Cong already
have concrete plans on what they want their
administration-to look like.

“I want SGA to run smoothly next year,
orients “And continue increasing

 

Future cabinet reveals aspirations

Apart from continuing and possibly im-
proving SGA’s visibility and accessibility or-
fenberg also has more deﬁnite plans that he
would like to see happen.

“I’d like to see a greater commitment to
social justice, one of our core values," 01’—
fenberg said. He not only wants to increase
funding for social justice internships, but
also for the various issues that take place on
campus. Something that Offenberg hopes to
achieve using alrcampus e-mails is encour-
aging students to apply for roles in student
government.

Guzman hopes to give a voice to under
represented communities, her platform for
V'PSA,

"I want to advocate for students and sink
dent groups not advocated for in the past,"
Guzman said. “I want to directly inﬂuence
student life in aspects such as residence, cli-
mate, dining. There is a lot of work to be
done, a lot of students just don’t feel safe or
pan of the community."

Cong wants to improve the academic part
of Grinnell, while Guzman views the need
to revamp the social atmosphere ofthc cams

us.
p "I want to work directly with adminis»
tmtors, faculty and stuff to reduce stress and
make the workload more manageable,” Cong
said, “Hopefully, I will work with CD0,
alumni council and academic departments
to increase the career and graduate school
support for students—secure our future after
Grinnell.” More deﬁnite plans include work-
ing with Ajust to expand the Pareto—Peer
Education program and reducing transcript

senior Challenge

A principle benchr ofthc Senior Challenge

is the money it generates for the college—
Grinnell historically has less alumni participa-
tion and a lower giving rate than its peer insti-
tutions.

According to the 2007708 20 Year Chal-
lenge Report £tom the Alumni Council, only
around 38 percent of alumni give to the Cole
lege in a given year.

“In the last couple years, some people have
said, ‘I will not give to the college until KY and
z happens,“ said SGA President Harry Krejsa
'10.

The option of giving to a speciﬁc cause or
project has always been awrilable to students
participating in the Challenghthe college
never emphasized it.

”Before it was a gift, or there was a space
where you could write in a restriction, but there
vns nothing speciﬁc,"]\’lunlcy said.

Gifts restricted in such a way are difficult
to work into the budgetary process, according
to Munlcy.

“Unrestricted git’rs do nor go into a black
hole, tho go into thc College's highest priority,
