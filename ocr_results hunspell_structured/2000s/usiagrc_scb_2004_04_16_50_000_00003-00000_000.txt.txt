The reaction or the audience was
lively and divided. Tire turnout was
large and rlrere were a number or town
members and faculty in the audience as
well as studenrs.

The goal orthe rounders orSClrE

to do is ger people to vote. to realize

both sides will realize that this is important on a level

quipped. “you've got to get engaged.“
