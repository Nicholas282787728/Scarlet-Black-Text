The recent spate ofvandalism reveals that stun
dent frustration with the institution of Grinnell
has ﬁnally hir rhc brenking point. Since the insti-
tution cares little about students’ well-being, sm-
dcnts should care little about the \vellebeing of the
institution and feel free to act out violent fantasies
against it when licavily intoxicated.

No.Thcrc are few lines ofrcasoning that strike
us is more ridiculous. If this is your justiﬁcation,
we hope you realize that the only thing you are
subverting is common sense. Campus bikes are
paid for with your money, as are the windows in
Harris. Furthermore, destruction of your fellow
students’ bikes is callous, disrespectful and unncce
cssary. Grow up.

Ifrhis is not your ”6011316,th ire you think
ing? What motivates you to takc every bike witlir
out a lock and barbarically destroy it? Why do you
rip senrs off campus bikes and bend handlebars?
Whit joy do you derive from shooting our Harris
windows? Do you have clear-thinking friends? If
so, where are they when you go on your rampages?

Vandals, whether your motivations are disillu-
sionment with the college community or drunken
amusement, we do not understand your behavior,
so please enlighten us. send an anonymous note
to mailbox A75.

Papal candidates reviewed

Pope, cont. from p. l

1 think rhe young Spaniards are for
Scola', the old ones keep changing their
minds.

Cardinals from developing coun-
tries comprise almost halfofrhc con-
clave voters, so in all fairness, Latin
America or Africa should rinilly get its
rurn.vvhi1e Grinnellinns might delight
in n minority pope, Spain is a bit more
squeamish.

From Africa, the
strongest candidate
by far is Annzc, n
rnging . conservae
live, and from Latin
America, Mara—
diaga ind Claudio
Hummes of Brazil.
Arinze is at a disade
vantage because of
racism and the rela—
rive youth or the Catholic presence in
Africa and Mirudingu bccnusc he com-
pi )d the media to Hitler (not cool).

If it comes down to a showdown
between the two Latin American
curdinils, which Spain would not be
opposed to, we can decide srricrly by
who can communicate with the most
diverse gloup ofpcople,Maradiaga l'ms
Humincs bent on number oflanguagcs
spoken, five to seven. Spain sympa-
thizes with Mar1d .g. because of
the Spanish thing and Grinnell lakes
Hummes because at least he used to be
a sociu libcml and gets nlong with pro
gressivc Christians,

Perhaps most critical, not only to
Grinnell and Spain, but to the whole
world, is the pope’s powers ordiplomne
cy‘, Catholicism his gor to play nicely
with other religions Tettamnnzi has

liS Mill.

(ardlnals from developing countries
(omprise almosilialfafllie amt/ave
voters, to in all fairness lal/‘n
Amer/((1 orAfr/‘ta should finally get

always followed John Paul 11's model
of encouraging dialogue between Irnle
inn Catholics and Muslim immigrants,
which is about is friendly is spam
will ger with Muslims. scold called
out another cardinal who said Turkey
should be excluded from the E.U., says
ing that defensive attitudes don’t help
anything.

He ilso started his on magazine,
Oarir, to improve
relations between
Christians and
Muslims and also
encourages dialogue
with the Eastern
Orthodox Church
cs. Schonborn does
similar work, but
doesn’t have his own
magazine. so Grine
ncll would go with Scola.

1r Arinzc is clccrcd, he is expected
to have great success in fostering peace
between Islam and Christianity not
only because of his origins in a half—
Muslim, half-Catholic country, but
also because of his work on intcrrcli—
gious councils; too bad he’s the most
conservative of the bunch.

sprin'scmse for specuhnng undrce
speculating about the outcome of the
couclavc will soon ﬁzzlc out and far be
u for me to presume to know spniu’s
or Gtinnellians'choicc. The Spaniards
and I will be relieved when it’s all over
and we can direct our full attention
to more important matters: like shale
ing our heads at Charles and Camilla.
Besides, I think the Holy Spirit is sup
posed to choose the pope, anyway.
