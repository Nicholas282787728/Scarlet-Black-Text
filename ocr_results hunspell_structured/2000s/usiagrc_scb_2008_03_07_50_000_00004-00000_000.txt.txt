Trial program seeks to increase recycling

New program in Kershaw, Haines and Langan adds recycling bins to every room and Dorm Environmental Coordinators

 

 

 

Letters

from p. 1 According to

Thomas Barcman
'10, who received one of the letters, recipients
were contacted by Interim Vice President of
student Affairs Elena Bernal who then set up
a meeting to discuss the mailings,“5he wanted
to make sure we were okay and find out what
we wanted to do about it," Bateman said.

Not all the students were completely com-
fortable with the meet'gng. Jose scgcbte Salazar
'09 was somewhat disturbed that the e-mail's
list orrecipients was not hidden, meaning they
had been distributed to individuals outside of
security. “If you want to talk about it, that's
fine,” he said, “But just the act that there’s a
compiled list that's gone outside or police rc-
coid—it’s kind orsciiy.”

In an all—campus e-mail, President Russell
l<. Osgood expressed anger at the continued
acts ofintoletance. “We are very saddened and
angered by what has happencdfl‘hose who en-
gaged in these cowardly acts will find no solace
in our community," Osgood wrote.

The centerpiece of the campus response
was a meeting in JRC 101 with an apparent
attendance of nearly 300 students, faculty and
staff. Bernal and Johanna Meehan, Philosophy,
delivered opening remarks emphasizing that
the message of the gathering was one ofcomt
munity and love, not one of hate.

After the opening discussion, organizers
unveiled the gatherings primary activityi
love mail. Attendees took advantage of crates
of paper and art supplies to make love letters
for their friends and peers. “In response to the
hate mail, the most beautiful thing we've come
up with is love mail,”Bernal said.

Again emphasmng the positive responses
to the limitquecr acts, Berna] also said that
the letters revealed some sense of desperation.

“Because last night was so powerful," chal
said, “the response back from folks who did
not want to see that happen, who arc living
with this latent anger had to mini: back
just as hard as what happened the other night
[with the rally and marchlt"

Some students, like chcbrc, felt that the
magnitude of the response to both the van
dalism and mailings incidents lcnr them too
much legitimacy and impact “We should not
give them so much currency as to disrupt our
personal lives," he said

After an allocampus forun the Stonewall
Resource Center (SRC) on Tuesday, many of
the 34 students spoke at an event in JRC 101
on Wednesday. Many students expressed their
anxiety and new fears about being on or it
nell’s campus, Afterwards, audience members
wrote questions on index cards,which the sul-
dcnts took turns answer ig,

While Andrews said she was upset by the
mailings, shc rcitcratod rhc importance ofrce
sponding in a positive manner. “We want to go
into a very positive vein with this,"shc s. id.

Bernal emphasized college services as a
means of coping with the events. She urged
students to take advantage ori-esouiccs in the
Mental Health Center, Student Services and
their friends. “Everybody’s wt'ting to thiow
their arms around their brothers and sisters at
Grinnell in support,” she said.

Berna] also categorically iejected the notion
that the incidents mean that Grinnell College
is not a safe and accepting community. “If this
wasn't an accepting community,” Bernal said,
“you wouldn’t have the hundreds of people
within a few hours ofan ermail."

BYALI SARGENT

For some students on campus the term
“canecairinvokes a leggy dance commonly per
formed by Vegas showgitls. With an dlnb ious
new pilot program intended to promote rccye
cling on campus, the student Environmental
Committee hopes that more students will think
or the “can-can" as, well, a place for cans.

This year, the student Elwlronlliental
Committee (SEC) implemented a new re»
cycling program on a trial basis in Kershaw,
Haincs and Langan residence halls aimed at
making recycling inoie convenient and, there-
toie, inoie common. The program consists or
two components—the addition of recycling
bins in all dorm rooms and the designation ofa
Dorm Environmental Coordinator (DEC) for
each dorm.

Program organizers agreed that the surest
way to increase recycling rates was to make it
more convenient. “It’s a lot easier for people
to recycle when they have something in their
room," said Laura Wilson ‘10, DEC fol Kei-
shaw.

The recently added cardboard recycling bins
were considered an answer to complaints about
the inconvenience or recycling in the dorms.
“We kept getting requests to put bins on ev-
ery ﬂoor and thatjust wasn’t going to happen,"
said Chris Balr '95, campus environmental and
safety coordinator, noting the potential fire haz-
ard and the excessive amount of work extra bins
would create for custodians.

The role ofthe DEC is to promote and co-
ordinate recycling within the dorms and their
activities are largely analogous to that of an
SA. DEC’s are responsible for throwing envi-
ronmentall v-themed study breaks, sending out
reminder emails and posting signs encouraging
recycling, and acting as a gorto person for envi~
ronmental questions or concerns.

. While Wilson said students haven't com—
pletely taken advantage of the program, what
involvement there has been is encouraging. “A
lot of people haven‘t come to me with quesr

tions," said Wilson, "but some have and that's
a stair."

As pait of the piogiam’s trial period, each
of the three DEC: are measuiing the changes
in recycling rates in their dorms to test the ef—
flcacy of the program After compiling the
data, DECs compared their own doims with a
neighboring dorm of similar capacity. Wilson,
who compaied l<ershaw to Rathje, found a one
hundred peicent increase in both paper and alur
minum recycling, and a fifty percent increase in
cardboard, but no difference in levels of glass
and plastic,

Though only currently in thiee residence
halls, the program has been well received by
participating dorms “It’s so nice to have the
box," said Liz Dreier '11,who lives on the third
ﬂoor of blames, “When I throw away garbage
in the hall trash can I don’t see a lot of recyt
clablcs in there." she said,

Anna Ford '11. who lives in Cleveland, is
jealous of her Haines neighbors, “I wish I had
one." she said of the recycling bins. “I’d use it,"

According to Bait, recycling on campus has
improved significantly since the midr905 when
he was a student.Thcn, there was only one recy
cling bin for South campus and one for North
Campus. he said.

Despite the progress since then, Bait said
that there is still room for improvement, par
ticularly in convincing students to use the availr
able resources,“1r's not hard to walk around and
find recyclables in a trash can that's ten feet
away from a recycling bin." he said.

The SEC hopes to expand the program into
more dorms for next year, and to make the DEC
a permanent position, but. as with any new pres
gram, student interest is a key factor. "It's likely
it will be expanding ifstudcnts show an interest
in tccycling," said Lyons.The administration is
“looking for students to care before they give
money"shc said.

The SEC hopes that with its efforts, more
students will be able to do the other “can—can.”

 

Town

from p. 1 paper had yet to
report on the luff
dents and also said that foitlicoming coverage
would likely be brief. "We’ll have probably a
small stoiy to iepoit to people that this hapr
pened on the campus,"Pinder said. “were just
going to lct people know about it. \Ve’le not in
a position to get that kind otcoveiage."

While little of the town seems to be aware
of the incidents, Pinder was conﬁdent that the
incident would gain publicity thioughour the
Giinnell area. “I think our r’lltlels will hear
about it, and I'd be willing to bet that people
listening to the iadio stations \vill hear about it
as well," he said.

Alexander said lack of information and
evidence about student experiences and par
tential abuses is one problem complicating the
commission's protection orrights in town,

She said she encourages students to more
actively inform the city of problems in town
and to even file formal complaints with the
commission.

Last fall the commission submitted a pron
posal to the Grinneil City Council to change
its ordinances defining what classes are cspCt
cially protoctcd against discrimination

By law, every community in Iowa with
more than 30,000 residents ls required to have
‘t| human rights commission. Though well be-
low thc population threshold, Grinncll’s gov-
crnmcnt voluntarily instituted its own com-
mission which, according to Alexander, made
the town the smallest community in Iowa to
have one.

Alexander said that the purpose or the
commission is to help set a standard orprotec-
tion for people in the community. “Our role is
to process complaints that come before us but
also to do education in the community and to

serve as a moral rorce in the community."Ale.c
under said, “[Wc] say this is how we think the
community should interacr with each other."

Don Schild, who has been a member ofthe
commission for 35 years, also said he would
like to see more involvement from students
“We've at various times tried to engage with
students,” Schild said,

“VVllat typically happens is when there's
an incident, there's a lot ofinrerest [in estab
lishing a connection] and once these incidents
have waned and the problem is no longer face
ing everyone. that interest fades."

“VVe’ve at times been killd of frustrated
that we couldn’t establish a dialogue." Scllild
said.“But it’s understandable because students
are really busy,"

But while the ofﬁcral response from the
town has been limited. the town is not com-
pletely unaware of the incidents, said Amy
l<alkbrtnucr, interim director of community
enhancement.

“I haven't heard of any movement to a
Coordinated community rcsponsc," she said.
“But peoplc have been sympathetic id thcir
response has bccn somewhere in between dis-
may and outrage."

Kalkbrcnncr said that there might be some
beneﬁt in holding a forum or some other event
connecting the town and campus but that do-
ing so might be difﬁcult. “My office is one
llalfrtime person so I'm not ready sure I'm
equipped to put together a really coordinated
community response," Kalkbrcnner said

“But there might be a place for that—I've
certainly seen the collcge coming together
around this issue."
