on Thursday, Indonesia

came to an agreement with

the World Health Organizar

tion (WHO) to begin supplying
the organization with samples of bird
ﬂu, ,

Bird ﬂu is a stiain of the ﬂu virus that has long worried
lawmakers and health ofﬁcials alike. It has sometimes been
connected to the pandemic ﬂu.

Since Janiiciiy, Indonesia and the WHO have been in dlS’
plite, Indonesia has suffered lhe most deaths from bird flu.
However, the country was unwilling to submit samples ofthe
disease, because they feared that in the event of an outbreak
the vaccines creatcdwould not go to liidonesians, but instead
would go to whichever country could pay the most,‘

Bird ﬂu outbreaks still pose a potential threat to many
nations and the world. Thursday, China reported a new case
ofbird ﬂu,the 23rd human case since 2003.

Last week. the Russian government stepped in and closed
off farms near Moscow due to an apparent spread of the dis-
ease among Live stock in the region. As to date, there have
been 277 human cases, with 167 conﬁrmed deaths.

A. , wa
Elections lead to abuse of email?

xv CHRlS NEUBERT

Behind every student election that Gtinncll College holds,
Election Board is thcrc to make surc cvcrything runs smoothly
This year, the board has already held scnntor elections and a
vote {at a special initiative, and hopes to hold another success-
ful election on Monday. .50 far this semester, the board has had
to deal with grievances for each election,which has meant more
work for the Election Board and a reexamination of election
policy.

Grievances air typically rarc,but ifdcemedscrious enough,
can invalidate election results. SGA Treasurer Brad Bishop'08,
one of the eight regularnncrnbctt of Election Board, said that
while every grievance is reviewed, few ever invalidate elections,
In fact, Bishop added, “no clcction in recent knowledge has
been thrown out,"

Each giicvance is evaluated according to what the board
considers propcr campaign procedure. According to Ari Anis~
feld '09, current chair ofthe Election Board and an $83 writer.
while there is no ofﬁcial policy regarding “proper procedure,"a
candidate must abide by the policies of the college, and "cam-
paign for themselves, not against other people."

This semester, the board received two grievances, both his
volving potential violations of academic computing use which
prohibits the sending of mass, unsolicited emails. In both‘
the East campus senator runoff election and the emergency

student initiative vote, students complained that they received
mass ermails urging voters to support their causes. The board
did not consider the complaints severe enough to invalidate the
elections, but turned them over to ITS since Election Board
does not have disciplinary authority,

Bill Francis, Director of ITS, echoed this view and added
that a case should he taken seriously if the e—mail significantly
affects student thought, Still, Franci aid that ITS would “shy
away from taking serious action unless it involves safety or the
security ofthe computer system.”

While both Dean for Student Life Jcnnifcr Ktohn and
Francis agreed that election policy should primarily be a stun
dent issue, there should be a ban on unsolicited e-inails. “If the
rccipient had a reasonable expectations: or has n social rela-
tionship to the sender," then a mass C’l‘nail may not be consid
cred unsolicited. “These are not Conclusive black-and-white
issues,"shc said.

At this point, Election Board hopes to meet with Francis
and ioohn soon to discuss college policy on mass e—mails and
other election issues. With new elections coming soon, Elec-
tion Board urges candidates to avoid sending mass etmails if
they could be considered unsolicited. In the meantime, the
status ofboth the current grievances and the college election
policy remains inconclusive.

 

SPARC amount of ﬂexibility. The heads of

from P- 7 each publication decide how much
to pay their writers and whether, for example. to sacrifice higher
quality printing for the suite of more layouttnight pizzas.

Part of the problcm’with running o tight budget for publi-
cations is that SPARC wants to spend as much of its allotted
funding as possible. If publications fall through or not enough
are proposed, SPARC’s unuscd hands are absorbed by the
school. Last semester, roughly $10,000 Went unused and is now
out ofSPARC's control:

At an houtStlong budget hearing meeting tin-cc weeks ago,
the committee took the most direct punitive measures in recent
memory against publications The committee voted to put the
multi-Cultiltal magazine The saw on "probation", denying it
funds for one semester because the pubbcation announced in
the middle oflast fall that it would not be icleasing an issue as
planned. Another publication that might not hit the mailroom
this semester is the Gum, which turned in a budget full of err
tors. The committee asked the Cmn media head to redo the
budget, but never got a icdrnft, so ifdistrihutctl the fund money
without accounting for the magazine.

SPARC also voted to deny $2,000 in funding requested by
more employees Eiic Rohn '08 and Joe MeNertny ’07 to our
tcntl the South by Southwest MuSic Festival in Austin, TX.
