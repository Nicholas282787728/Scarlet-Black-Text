Requiem chronicles drugs and drama

Afronofsky’s famous ode to the fuddled lives of Brooklyn natives hits Harris this weekend as hard as ever

BY Col.lN CARR

If there is any math to be gained from “Requiem tor a
Dream," it is that director Darren Aronofsky really doesn’t want
you to do drugs. And who could blame him> There are a lot
of grisly stories out there of lives plummeting to squalor m a
haze ordependenoy and abuse, Aronofsky tells tour suth sto—
ries, all adapted from a Herbert Selby Ir. novel ofthe same title
as the ﬁlm. The film's main chars
actets all lave in Brooklyn and
know one another. However, they
are too wrapped up in rherr own
nightmarish affairs to notice that
their loved ones are in the same
pitiful state. one can understand
the seliraosorption otthese char-
acters not only because of their
addiction, but because of the de—
pravity of their situatrons. These
are cautionary tales of the bleakest sort,

The film is an ensemble, but actor Jared Leto gets the most
screenrtime. He plays Harry Goldfatb. an uprantieeornrng drug
dealer who dreams otmaltrng enough money for him and his
girlfriend Marlon (Jennit'er Connolly) to get otr the streets and

a dilating pupil. he a smart way orcapnrring the almost robotic
swrftness With which the user tarrres out the process.

And yet for all of this meritolotrsly orchestrated fervor,
Aronoﬂey’s singlesminded efforts to break our hearts ultimately
prove alienating, He‘s such a manipulative director, so focused on
pummeliug us as moth as possible with the pathos ofthcsc chars
aeters' lives, that he sacrifices any serious attempt to understand
his characters. Their lives lack nuance and we begin to sense that
Aronorsky only cares to tell us something about them when he
can use this information later to deepen the tragedv of his story.
so, for example, when Tyrone has a fairly inane childhood ﬂash
back othis mother telling him to always he a good boy, we know
this ﬂashback wrll reactur at the dingiest moment otTyrone's
life, just to lemlnd us how short he has fallen of his mother's
injuuttrons.
