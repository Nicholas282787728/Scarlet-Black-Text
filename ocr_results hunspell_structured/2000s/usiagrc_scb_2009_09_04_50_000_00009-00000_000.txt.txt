’ZineTeaze: A Sneak Peek at
this semester’s S&B Magazine

We at the 5&8 are really excited to be launching a magazine supplement to complement the newspaper’s cover-
age ollife at Crinnell. After a brief start last semester, we are ready to offer a full range oilongsterm reporting,
critical essays and artistic expressionThis week, we’re running a teaser page to give our readers a taste of what
to expect. Two columns discussing the role ofa liberal arts education compare the perspectives ofa student and
a former professor. Be sure to check back in a few weeks for our first full issue of the year!

Two views on the Liberal Arts

bvjoi: HlLLER

By our own choice, we are all submerged
in the liberal attsithcy surround and perme-
ate every aspect of our small college experrr
encc, from our academic courses to our act
tiv‘tst engagements to out
artistic pursuits. They are
inescapable and ever pres-
cntievcn our residential
environment is designed
with the liberal arts in
mind. However, despite
their overarching supremt
aey on campus, the liberal
arts are precisely what is
most liberating about our
Grinnell education.

The liberal arts are the
truest road to what Brazilr
ian educator Paulo Fr'eire calls “education as
the practice of freedom." It is no coincidence
that “liberal"and “liberty"sltare the same etyt
mological toot.

Indeed. the pedagogy of the lrbernl arts is
a pedagogy offrccdomithe freedom to forge
a unique path through academic disciplines
and extracurricular activities, the freedom
to continue feisty intellectual discourse late
into the night over tea with your friend from
down the hall, the freedom to plan activist
events with one oryour professors to demand
action from college administrators and, per
haps most importantly. the freedom to define
and give shape to your own particular free—
dom. Such an education—such freedom—
has no limits.

Moreover, a meaningfully realized liberal
arts education is hurrranizrng, entranchising
and enormously invigorating. It stands in die
rect opposition to dogmatic indoctrination
and stifling rote memorrzatron. those opprCSr
sive “educations" which limit discourse and
critical thought. education that draws stark
lines between “teacher," the holder ofttnquesr
tionable truths, and “student,” the empty ves—
sel to be filled with the teacher’s ideas.

Instead, a liberal arts education brings
all community members into constructive
dialogue and recognizes that all people have
something to reach and something to learn in
rhc shared hopeful pursuit ofknowledge.

The liberal arts are antithicrarch‘ical and
prioritize no one viewpoint or academic sper
cialty over anotherithey are empowering
and enlightening, marked by open-eyed ques-

tioning, rife with intellectual curiosity and int
terdisciplinary creativity. Their cmancipating
effects transcend the classroom, lasting long
after the four or more years of undergraduate
schooling have ended. Their value cannot be
overstated.

For this reason, and
for the undeniable ex»

the hedonistic pursuit
of intellectual or social
pleasures. it must also

It is the duty of
those of us privr-
leged by a liberal arts educa—
tion to recognize our privilege and
to use it for the betterment of ourselves
and of the world. The precise form that this
betterment should take is undetermined. But
what better way to understand it and give it
shape than through the liberal arts?

Bv MAXWELL LEUNC

VVhen I was asked to write a short cs-
say about my understanding of a liberal arts
education, I was not sure if] was the most
qualiﬁed person to talk about it I did not M,

existence, Yet here I am at Grinncll College.
teaching and working with the most excepr
tional students that I have ever had, But I have
an idea on what it might be, so here‘s my best
shot.

The liberal arts involve skills learned to
tree the mind. lift up society and embrace the
ethical and moral responsibilities of a citizen
of the world, These are skills that form the
foundation ofan aetrve, rnforrned and engaged
citizenry—in short, practices of freedom,

When I was offered the opportunity to
ioin the faculty at Grinnell College, a close ac-

tivist friend and com-
munity organizer-
privately criticized
me because

he believed

that I was
“sellin g

out." Dc-

spite my

anger at

his net
cusation,

I found

myself

contenr
plating

what it

w o u l d

mean for

me to live

in the midi

dlc of Iowa,

teach at an instillk

tron of vast wealth

and work with intellectut

ally clitc students. My friend and I

had both graduated from San Francisco
State University, a school that is known for the
Third World Student Strikes in the late 19605
that led to the establishment of the nation’s
first Collegc of Ethnic Studies. Vile believed
that after graduating we would work for the
betterment of our communities in San Frans
eisco. Butwhen i went on to become a profeSr
sional academre, I was seen as abandoning the
young men and women ofthe community who

could have benefited from my skills, knowlr
edge and access to resources. What would an
cxccptionally bright and intelligent student
body at a nationally ranked college with an
astronomical endowment do with a teacher-
scholai'tactivist like me?

My doubts about coming to Grinnell subr
sidetl, howevei,when I learned more about the
College‘s values ofsocral responsrbrlrry and ass
tion, and its strong tradition of self-governance
and personal responsibility. I was encouraged
by the Sociology department's commitment to
social justice as well as their recognrrion ofthe
importance of community building. My un-
derstanding ofa liberal arts education expandr
ed to involve more than the mere acquisition
oflearned skrlls.I now understand a liberal arts
education as deeply interlinked with practices
of emancipation, justice and democracy. The
goals ota liberal arts education are empty rhetr
oric it they do not confront privilege, luxury
and apathy head on.

I immediately recalled the words my men-
tor said to me over twenti years ago, when I
was an undergraduate student: “You need to
step up Simply put, its taking what vou lcarn
to the next level. The easiest part of a liberal
arts education is learning—it is harder to plﬂC’
tice your values, and hardest of all to challenge
oppression in its many forms. On a campus as
idyllic as Gr'innell College, there |S always a
need to “step up."I admire the A-Just Grinnell
and No Limits Project as two examples of
stepping up, of taking one's education to the
next level. More importantly, these political
projects and many others like it, have prof
duced a vibrant discussion about the very es,
sence orcmanciparion justice and democracy.
They asked, “What does agency look like at
this campus community>", “How do we prac-
tice frecdom?"and, finally, “How do we further
enhance the possibilities for freedom?"Thesc
are vital questions that can be asked at any col»
legs with a liberal arts curriculum in this nae
tion.

But there is only one reason why anyone
would want to raise rind attempt to answer
these questions at Grinncll College, and that
is the shared genuine desire to learn, live and
practice freedom. Anything short of that and I
don’t think you are stepping up.
