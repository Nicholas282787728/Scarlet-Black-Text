We have been forced to recogt
nizc that our college is prone to the
same misunderstandings and prejudices that plague
the rest of the world.

We nccrl to take the next step, and extend our
etioits against hatred beyond the college to the
wider community,

The forums, rallies, and postering ctrorrs Cim

which the town ot‘ Grinncll participate in this dia—

our antithdtc message to rl term from.

So tar this his not happened. The mayor was
first informed of the hate
crimes lnst VVetlnesday at:

The G miel/ Halli/ti

of the hate crimes through
the Grinncll Police Departs

story on the hate crimes. Because of the difficulty
or accessing Grinncll College, the article will be
small, But the gesture of adopting a issue affecting
the college is a heartening sign orourreach.

Similarly, the new Ad Hot: focusing on Hate
crimes committee inernbcrsliip should be opened
to non-college Students, This could help bring a

broader range of views into our outreach errorrs.
And, hopefully, establish a larger connection be-

Many townspeople have already shown support,
and more might if they knew. Faculty, start and
students should do all they can to spread awareness

the relationship between
students and townspeople.

SGA’s sclftgovcrnnncc
handbook stresses the fact
that the town of Grinncll
is and should be viewed as
a part our community. We
have a chance now to reach
out to that brondct com—

atmosphere,

In the spirit of reaching outside of ourselves,
spreading a positive message and opening new
channels of communication, towntcollcge relations
are the next step in ensuring that the college m“,

Tattoos and taboos: the untold story of leprosy

Scared of Noyce? Darcy Ward /09 breaks down the developments of the wide world of science for you
