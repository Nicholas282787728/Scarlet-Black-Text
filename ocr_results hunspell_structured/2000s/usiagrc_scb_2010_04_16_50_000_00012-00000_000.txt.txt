A message from the
future 5&3 editors

At the end or every academic year, seniors graduate and
new people prepare to join the Grinncll community. These
springtime evolutions include new editors taking over the

responsibilities. one ofwhich is ensuring that the campus com-
inunity is heard.

While we as editors try our best to focus on the most pertit
nent stories every week, we can only do so much Through det
bate and eventual consensus we arrive at the stories we publish,
Unfortunately, however, that debate is only among a handful of
editors, and often leaves important voices unheard.

The SUB is not only studentvrun, it is student-owned

You should booze local

it's hard to go a week at the College without hearing
about local foodsiwhcther in the Dining Hall, at McNal-
ly's or even in the Academic arcnli. We at the 5&3 even talk
about it in a large chunk of our issues, and very rightfully so.
The benefits otbuying local—qualitatively, economi—
cally and environmentally—are countless

So that’s why we should think beyond just our
food when buying localiwe should think of our
booze. ,
Iowa is not Colorado—we don't have counts
less microbrews swilled across the country. Iowa
is not Portland—we don’t rule the country in beer—hipnessr
lowa, in general, is relatively lacking in locally brewed bever»

Campus planning for a greener future

This past Monday, a representative of Shepley Bulfinch
presented four proposed campus plans that will guide the con—
struction of a number of new buildings here on campus. The
proposed new buildings will provide new classrooms and lie
brary space, house the new center for Social Inquiry and Met
dia Lab, and expand spaces for rhe reading and writing labs,
These buildings, according the college, will provide facilities
for valuable campus services and could be a welcome addition
to campus life.

However, were surprised to learn that a college that has,
over the last year, stressed the instability of its financial situa-
tion continues to move forward on these large—scale projects.
While we are troubled by the fact that the administration has
undertaken this construction project at the expense of drastic
cally more important measures like financial aid and scholar
ships, we acknowledge the potential benefits these spaces profa
fer, Considering this fact, continuing with the project should
necessarily include the commitment to highly efﬁcient designs
that reduce resource consumption and limit environmental im-
pactsrThrs college has already seen the folly of counting on a
prosperous future and consequently withholding endowment
spending, and one of the best ways to ensure the long-term
ﬁnancial stability of the college is to be conscious of limiting
operating costs.

Further. the college has committed to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions below 2010 levels by forty percent, and if these

construction projects go forward, the college may lose out on
the opportunity to meet that goal unless the buildings are high»
ly efficient. Achieving these levels ofefficiency will mean more
than simply tacking on green features at the end ofthe design

processt It is necessary to prioritize the efficiency and environ- ,

mental sustainability from the very outset ofthe planning stage.
For these reasons we hope that if and when the administration
moves forward on these construction projects, it requires the
architect to prioritize the efﬁciency of the buildings in their
initial layout and design.

Besides insisting on efficient architecture, one way to ensure
that the buildings truly meet the needs ofthe college is to in—
volve the campus community in all stages ofthe planning of the
projects. Too often this administration has failed to effectively
realize such opportunities and as a result has seen the distrust
and ineffective design that can rise out of such shortcomings.
Those who will use the space in the future can say best what
features will most adequately serve their needs.

A team’s right to remove their clothes

We, as the Grinnell college distance track ream, love
streakingl mean we really like it. l—listorically, before every
home cross country or track meet, both the men’s and women's
teams streak the campus to advertise those meetsl‘his is a (raw

There .itejust barely a dozen niicrobreweries in lowa,but
one local bicwer, Mason Groben of Madhouse Brewery in
Newton, IA, represents a new and exciting potential trend
(set: our story on page 5). Grobcn,who runs a two-man hilsie
neb‘s out of an oltl Maytag warehouse, has plans to brew and
bottle beer to distribute throughout Iowa.

Brcwing began just last month, and while Groben does
not get all ofliis ingredients from lowa, he hrews,bottles and
tlansporls his beer from 20 miles away. An investor is also
growing lawn hops to be used in later beers. This budding
brewery has the chance to give Central Iowa a little SOIDE’

thing more to root for.

At Grinnell, we love our PBR and
whatever McNally's has on firevsale. It’s
usually relatively tasty stliﬂriand cheap.
But when offered with a choice between
the massive factories that pump out
macro-brew by the tons, and a ﬁrmnked

room run by a guy in Newton who happens
to have a dream, maybe every once in a while, we can reach for
something a litde closer to home,

 

dition stretching back as long as anyone can remember, and
until yesterday there has been no issue with it. On Thursday
afternoon, the team was informed Via two proxies that the ad-
ministration liad mandated that the coaches talk to “the players
about not being involved in the nudity run across campus this
year." The reasons given included the fact that “this weekend
is a big admission weekend and there is also an Alumni event
going on.”

While we find these concerns to he reasonable,we also
strongly disagree with the administration's argument on several
levels. First and foremost, we like getting naked. Second and
secondmost, this is ‘sl tradition with its roots reaching much fur
that back thanjust this year's team, and the administration has
offered no reason as to why the tradition should be broken now
ofall times. Finally, the reasoning that prospies and alumni
will be here this weekend holds little weight considering that
they have almost always been present for the streaking. Fur-
thermore, any alums who return this weekend likely would have
themselves been exposed to the distance team’s streaking habit
when they attended, and shielding prospics from the realities
of Grinnell does a disservice both to them and the admissions
process

Let “S be clear; we have a full respect for the admin-
istration's viewpoint, but the arguments they have given make
little sense to present now instead of5 or 10 years ago, and are
further based in a concern for the deception of students past,
present. and future.
