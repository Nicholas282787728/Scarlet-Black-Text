Ocean’s Thir—
teen (2007)

Boy oh boy do 1 1111c hcist movies. There’s
just something about the danger and excite-
ment in 111c111,1vo11dc1-111g if our lovable and-
hcrocs will gct 1w1v with it, that gets me on
the ed": ofiny seat. The best ones always liavc
some ort of awesome con at the end, but, as

sort of ﬂat.

Keeping up with the movie is fairly difficult
even with the helping hand we're given. This
is a busy niovia But fun is to he had 111 all this
commotion: characrcrs rcfcrcncc everything

Like T/rr Goya/1111 to the actors pcrsonal livcs.
These in-jokes and meta-stunts don't contiib—
ute to plot or character development (we know
rhc score and these guys anyway), but rhcy add
to the movie's manic energy.

Omani Tbxi'lem is no masterpiece. It won’t
win any Oscars. But it’s fun, it’s entertaining,
and that's plcnty good for me.

dents are under the constant surveillance of
the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). TI}:
1.1111 ofowm, the 2006 Academy Award win7
net for Best Foreign Language Film, explores
the depth of the Ministry’s control, painting a
rewardingly complar portrait of an East Berlin
writct and the Stasi agent spying on him.

Morality plays an intricate role in the life of
author Georg Dreyman. The writer is caught
between the conformity needed to survive and
the freedom required of his craft. l—Iis girl7

. friend, Christa7Matia Sieland, involved with
rhe,polirical f1gurcs following him, further
cnranglcs his plight. Drcyman and Sieland's
choices, intricately linked to the powers-that-

both a suffocating realism and a 1i11crating
purpose, promotes the ethics that encourage
individualism ovr1 passive obedience.

The tone is one ofrcdcmprion and hope in
a city overcome by manipulation. Stasi agents,
including Dreyman’s counterpart Gard Wi7
esler, are seemingly omniscient. Wiclser is first
established as dispassionate and effective. His
picrcing stare, inruitivc knowledge of inrcrro-
garion and cruclry mark him as a rcprchcnslblc
monster, but his own realization of the horror
his office holds in the city adds true poignancy
to his character. His eventual redemptionwhen
facing this internal Conﬂict is the allure of the
movie; his sympathy purs a human facc on an
establishment determined to be as anonymous
as possiblc and ms pcnancc for the deeds he
committed gives hope to any caught between
crushing duty and 1cdccming passion.

lies in its presentation ot’ducl moialitics, both

Iron Island
(2 005)

As Iran 11111114 begins, there is a wide
sweeping shot of an oil rankcr, and thoughts
of Wam-wm'lrl [I quickly entered my mind.
Luckily, this low-budgrr allegorical filrn deliw
cts everything VVnMrwm‘M didn’t.

The abandoned oil tanker is home to hun-
dreds ofMiddle Eastern squatters, all ofwhom
are trying to make a life for themselves, some—
thing that cannot be found on land. Captain
Nehmat, the unquestioned leader of the ship,
provides jobs and 1 jovial arrirudc that infuses
the people wuh hopc, Nchmar turns 1nyrhing
and everything inro an opportunity, inc111d1ng
dialing phone numbers for other pcopIc, as7
serting that life on the ship is but a stepping
stone to fururc prospcriry.

These claims clash with much of the real-
ity of the situation. The ship is sinking, the

Nehmat has other worries besides money,
as his protégc’, Ahmad, has hrrn going behind
his back 1o see a girl (unnamed) who has al-
ready been promised 1o another. When Ah-
mad tries to escape, Nehmat’s cruelty and au7
thoritarian nature, hidden beneath his cheerful
exterior, ﬁnally come to light. .

The allegorical nature of the ﬁlm may
scare some viewers off, but director Moham-
mad Rasoulofdoes a fantastic job walking the
ﬁne line between heavy-handedness and being
too subtle. One complaint is that the film is
too short, as 90 minutes is not enough time
to rcally develop storylincs 1nd charactcrs ro
their fullest potential. But, despite the length.
Iron Irlmid gives us a fascinating insight into
Middle Ersrcrn society.
