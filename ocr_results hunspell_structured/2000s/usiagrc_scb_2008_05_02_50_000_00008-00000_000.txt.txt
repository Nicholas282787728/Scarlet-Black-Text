Inside the minds of Grinnell s hip- hop group Honor G

BYMIKE KLEINE

on a brisk Friday night three weeks ago, Gardner Lounge
is packed \vrth students The lights are off, the air is warm, and
the ground Is covered In sweat.

The lights start getting brighter, a repetitive driiinbeat suds
denly fills the air and silhouetted ﬁgures begin to make their
presence known offstage. As the lights unite with the beat, the
chanting gets progressively louder, and the members of Hon-
or G begin to assertively Inake rhcir way onto the stage, As
the opening hear resounds, each member begins rapping. The
crowd goes wild arid the lights start ﬂashing,

Asa Wilder ’10

litical Science maon from Washington, began the group about}

a year agnlde began toying with the idea or recording a rap
song In 2007, and Lindgren and Balasubrnhmanynn offered to
make him a beat after listening to him freestyle

"Grinncll needed hip hop," said Balasubrahmanyan “The
result was ‘Portrait ofthe Haidest as a loung Man on last year s
Freesoiind CD.

Surprised by the positive response, the three began recruit-
ingvarious students on campus Right now, Honor G is working
on a short EP that will be the pinnacle of their bricfcarecr

"Max had freestyled with Alex and Asa at Block Party the
previous year, so we decided to invite them to join the group,
said Bdlasubrahmanyan. “They were both real good."

Wilder. “Hopefully, Honor G can become an open student
group where anyone who can spit can just come and try it
out.”

What makes Honor G distinctively Grinnellian can be
found within their lyrics. Forget bling, guns, drugs, or prosti—
tutcs~Honor G is about life at Grinnell. Examples of song
topics include dinosaurs, polities, growing up, being born and
going to the doctor. “Diagnosis/ psychosis/ the doctor’s prognos

on one oftheir songs.

Although many of the group’s members will be graduating,
the groups future holds plenty ofpotcntial.‘ Isort ofsee Honor

members graduate," said Balasubrahmnnyan. Maybe 'Honor G
will become a Grinnell' Institution

Annual Student SalOn promises diverse arts'show

stu SARGENT

The artist salon tradition originated in are
old academic world in France, inspiring today's
American colleges and universities to ﬁnish
up the year by holding senIor shows. GrimIell
continues the tradition—albeit sans powdered
wigs—with this Friday's student Art Salon.

The Salon is one of the most interesting
shows to attend because the variety in work
makes it come together as a work of art iself—
like a sort of collage. It has more or a group
spirit,’ ’said Allison Rosenthal 09. “It's cool" just
to see all or them together.

This years artist gallery will feature less
drawing and painting than previous years, but
almost every material imaginable mikes an up
pcuancwincludiiig wire yarn balloons Vlax,
tree branches water and faint ﬁir. "Thercs a lot
ofcomplcxity III the show this year, said Wright,
noting that rccendy more facility members have

been doing work between mcdias, which seems
to have inﬂuenced students.

While all artistsgseniors and non—seniors,
majors and non—majors—arc invited to submit
their work, in dIe end not everyone is selected to
participate in the juried show Each year the Art
SEPC chooses a yuror, and this years is Darrell
Taylor, the director of the University of Noi them
Iowa Gallery of Art In Cedar Falls. “I think he
was a really gIeat juror because he was consid-
ering the whole sIturtIon or the salon," said Vet
ronica Erb ’08, member of the Art SEPC. “He
was very mindful that every work was here bee
cause someone was invested in It and took time
to make it and submit It."

Thuc are IIpsides and downsides to this pro-
(:55. Having a single thud-patty judge not only
ensures that the indging will be purely based on
the specific piece a student has submitted, but
also helps give thc shouliwhich has featured

up to 55 ﬂrﬁstsﬁomc sense of cohesion While
this can be fmstrating for students whose work
doesnt fit the particular judges Vision, it does
mean that rejection can’t be taken too hard.This
year's judge is aware himselfo this issue. “The
works chosen for this exhibition represent a
point ofview, mine, and they symholi-oc an aess
thetic that favors the experimental, the daring, .
and e narrative gestuies in art," Taylor iviote
udgc’s statement.

The selection process docs cause tension
among students, “There's a certain amount
of competitiveness With the salon," said Alex
Schechter‘ 10. But he was confident that the an
community at Griiinell Is a supportive one, fiee
from RISD- -style backstabbing. its not to tear
the other person down, its more like 1 want to
do better," he said.

As an getting in goes, this year was sun
pIisiIIgly less competitive than previous years,

and organizers were disappointed by the turnout.
“When I was a freshman and sophomore it felt
like a bigger deal,” said Carson Smith ’08. Out
of the 99 pieces submitted this year, 62 were ac-
cepted, coInparcd to two years ago, when nearly
200 were submitted, and only 78 were accepted.

Traditionally, the Student Salon shares the
Faulconer gallery with a faculty arts show, which
occupies the from half of the gallery. This year’s
Faculty Art Biennial features Lydia Diemer, Lori
Raife and Emna Zghal, the three visiting art fac-
ulty members.

The Student Salon means a lot to senior
artists not just because it's one of the biggest art
openings of the yeai, but also because its the last.

“When you re a senior you tend to do that last
gnne, said Erb. This Is the lastsuon for me and
the othci scnio

Plans for student art (finally) at the JRC

BY KATHRYN BENSON

Since the opening of thc building, students have cams
plained about the lack of art adorning the white walls of the
JRC. This Friday, that's finally going to change.

At this Friday’s Student Ait Salon ‘In
the Faulconcr Gallery, {our student works
of art will be selected for a collection that
will hang in the notoriously blankswallcd
JRC.

The Office of Strident Affairs and
SGA, using money from the STIFIInd,
will each be awarding two $250 purchase
prizes. The awards will be presented at
4:30 p,m. during the stuchIt salon rcccpr
tion.

All this would not be possible Wlfll’
out the participation of various Individuals and Institutions.
Houston Dougharty, the new vice president for Student Af-
fairs and Faulconer Gallery Director Lesley anhr Icpre-

senred their respecth ofﬁces. SGA Senators Emily Rcicrss
guard ’08, Nick Blencowe ’08 and Spencer Green '09 formed
a committee this semester to use money from the STIFund
to make that dream a reality after the success of student art
student initiatives.

The committee only contacted
Dougharty two weeks ago. “We were
trying for wccks to get something done,"
Green said. “Once Houston got wind of
it, Itjust happened within clays."

The day aftci he heard about the
student art initiative, Doiighaity was
scheduled for a tour of the Faulconcr
with Wright as part or his process of
getting to know Grinnell. Dongharty
suggested the idca of purchasing stir

Dcugharty sccs the success or this project ns an example
ofwhat can be accomplished when students and administrae
tors work together. “Student Affairs and SGA can be adv<>s
cates for each other and partners, in this case with the gallery
as well,’ he said.‘ "It s a wiIi/win/win situation.”

It‘s also possible that the F-Iiiilconer Galleiy will lend
works from a collection of student art to the JRC. “Weie
happy to work with them," Wright said.

Next ycar, student Affairshopcs to continue and expand
the program or at least to match this year's prizes.

There Is even talk of starting an art lending program in
several veaIs such a program based offofa similarprogiam
at Iowa State, would allow students and faculty to borrow art
to hang III dorm rooms a. ofﬁces for the semester, once the

Above all, Doughaity said, including stiidcnt art can

they can come hack and see It and still reel lIke part of the
GrInIIell comIIIIIIIIty.“
