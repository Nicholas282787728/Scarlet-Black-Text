participating in campus
activities. Veny rarely
do I venture outside or
these grounds to
immerse myself in
Midwestern culture.

This is because in
actually did, I would
have to exert much
needed energy and lose
my precious, precious
seat in instab.
Ihankrully, due to the
technological advances
of the last 10 years, I
can now fully expen'enee
all aspects of Iowa
without leainng my
chair or getting poop on
my shoes,

The ﬁrst stop on my
virtual tour of Iowa was
The [am [am (located
at wwwiowararrnercom/
corncam/comhtml). At
this site one can watch
corn grow at its actual
speed. If this site
sounds dull and tedious
to watch, I recommend
the Soybean cam

Book review: Breakfast of Champions

Kurt Vonnegut's strange, illustrated adventure worth a read

Is itbad form to begin a book review by discussing the end of just like his ctcalor’s dcad father, Whose fault is that?

the book? probably, but I'm going to anyway, because it’s the last
few pages orBrco/rfarr ofC/rarnpionr that set it apart from other
Vonnegut tales. some people love this ending, and others don't;
I just think it epitomizes what he does best,
which is talk about serious and sometimes
emotional things in a way that ends up mak.
ing everybody laugh (or at least crack a
smile), '

Forget the beginning and even the
middle (or now, though they're just as good.
Its not until chapter 25 that Vonnegut starts
doing what I haven’t seen many authors do
before, whidi is set himself up against his
most well known and faithful (hammer,
Kilgorc Trout.

Deciding to intercept Trout on his way
to thc Midland City Festival of the Arts,
Vonnegut gcrs himselfmixed up enough in
his own novel to make you start wondering
how much control authors really have over
what they write.

The scenario goes like this: since Vonnegut created Trout,
he knows exactly where to ﬁnd him when the time comes. How-
ever, he fails to remember a second inﬁucntial character created
earlier in the book— a Doberman pinscher named Kaaak. This
inrcrminglmg oraurhor and book really tweaks the reader's per.
spective, and is ﬂawlessly accomplished “I {cared nothing. Thar
was foolish of me,” Vonnegut writes. “A writer orhguard, since
the materials with which he works are so dangerous. can expect
agony as qu|ck as a thi‘tndcrclap." .

After a narrow escape from attack by a dog he himseltwrore
into the novel, Vonnegut manages to track KilgorcTrour down,
staging an interesting and rather bafﬂing conversation between
the two. Vonnegut lays it all out on the table, tries to break the
news gentlszmuK doesn’t really exist, he's just a “character" in a
“book." Trout, somewhat apprehensive and pretty much speech

than

you in?

—
...the book might not
presume to be much more
the tale of “two
lonesome, skinny, fairly
old white men on a
planet which is dying
fast." But put that way,
isn't that enough to draw

This is not to mention Votincgurs writing style, which is
pure gold, There are none so successful at simultaneous hilarity
and sarcasm. Vonnegut takes time to dcscribc {undamcnralx that
nobody thinks very hard about anymore,
such as hamburgers (cows “killed and
ground up into little bits, then shaped into
parties and fried, and put between two pieces
ofbread”), cigarettes (“paper tubes sturred
with leaves, set on ﬁre"), and the u 5. na.
tional anthem (“gibberish sprinkled with
question markx"). ,

The entire book is peppered with small
witticisms and with Vonncgur's own artwork
7 iryou're looking for a good picture book,
this is it. You can't avoid laughing, or rum-
ing pagcs.

Once I was in my room reading some
Vonnegut, and got to a passage that made
me laugh so hard there were tears streaming
down my race. I was all alone and wasn't do—
ing it for anyone elses beneﬁt, but such is the eﬁecr of good
literature: Anyway, my dad rushed into the room, worried be
cause he thought he heard me crying. When hesaw the book on
my lap he chuckled and left. That was actually TAmtqu/ll’z, a
dirrerent book by Kurt Vonnegut. some eﬁrect, though

Ifyou’rc wondering about the title, it’s pretty simple, really
Vonnegut decided to put a cocktail waitress in his book who
never serves martinis without ioking, “Breakfast otchampionsi"
Some things in this book happen without rhyme or reason, but
Vonnegut never pretends that being a writer means stringing
together constant streams of brilliance or universal truths. He’s
just our to tell a good story.

In fact, the book might not presume to be much more than
the tale or“rwo lonesome, skinny, fairly old, White men on a
planet which was dying fast.” But put that way, isn’t it cnough to
draw you in?

Intaglio is the campus
book club. The group

Dnll'ne, a site where you
can view a colorful wall
of farmer hats. At this
site you can also
purchase various rarm
implements and
accessories, such as
manure spreaders,
portable sawmills,
winches, and elk (the
animal). If anyone has
any idea what a winch
is, I am very curious to
know.

Then, to my surprise,
I discovered that there
is in fact a
www.scooptheloop.com.
It is a boring site about
cars. similarly,
www.cruisethestripcom
is not much more
exciting or spin'tually
fulﬁlling than the actual
activity.

Finally, my virtual
tour of Iowa brought me
to the oincial cows
tipping homepage,

,located at www.juris.dk/
mtch/cowtip/. here,
you can tip a variety of
cows without pulling
muscles or running into
people named Jed. Vou
can also play the
harrowing game Cow
Canyon Vertigo, in
which you are able to
tip cows into a canyon
in exchange ior points.

It you want to
participate in actual
Iowan events in real
life, that’s really
strange.

F: All right, it’s a big week {at me,
since it's the ﬁrst week I've actually seen
BOTH of the Harris movies. I think
it’s a big step.

creatures. The pieces or music in this

And right now. I'm going to ruin it. So

because he was just dreaming.

“OK, so what?" I thinkl missed the
message. so the 19st were so shallow
that people rvuirt even look deep

We all knew that already The movie
might have been harder-hitting if it
