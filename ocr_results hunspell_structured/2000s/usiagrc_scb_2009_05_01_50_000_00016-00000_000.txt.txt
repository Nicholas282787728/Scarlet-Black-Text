Tornado warnings are n semi-
common occurrence here at Grinnell
When I, a New Yorker, think of tornn-
does, I see Dorothy and Toto swirling
around and a whole lot of destruction

Louis IVIichaud, a Canadian en-
gineer, sees them quite differently
Instead of wreckage, he sees a poten-
tial power source. There is one slight
problem—tornadoes ale a bit hard to
control.

So Michaud found a way to make
his own tornado using an invention
he calls the Atmospheric Vortex En»
gine (AVE). It creates a tornado—like
occurrence that generates about 200
megawatts of electricity. That would be
enough to power the town of Gtinncll.

Of course, it is not actually a torna-

Use Mental Health Services

Get rid of arbitrary analysis

T here are few things that I really, only hate
in 1] ‘ One ofthem is iinyless dining; it makes
no log til sense, and from breakfast on it casts
a horrible shadow over my clay. However, more
even than traylcss dining, I hate the Arbitrary
Analysis. I do not care about your opinion of the
weather, ni- splinters, or .myrhing else, and you
have no right to judge me for my hate of tray-
lcss dining! Ethan Struhy hid it i-ighr, Please,
please, plcﬂsc, replacc the Arbitrary Analysis with

Conjunctivitis is an illness packed full or lies.
“Pink eye." though n seemingly friendly name, does
not lend itself to seeing the world in a rosicr light.
Instead, the crusty goo that seeps out of your eye
socket hinders vision in general, let alone seeing it
