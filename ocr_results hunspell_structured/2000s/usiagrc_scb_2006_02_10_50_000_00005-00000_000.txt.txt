Bamboo: Tradition, Function, Style

by EMILIA CARVE‘I

Waves crash silently against the walls of Fault
coner Gallery.

A green bird’s nest sits on the ﬂoor,

An oversized tea whisk casts soft shadows Both
delicate and strong, these objects speak quietly but
are made from a big stick.

The current exhibit in Faulconer Gallery, “Hin:
The Qriet Beauty of Japanese Bamboo Art," con
tains 37 pieces by 37 contemporary Japanese artists
and artisans spaced out on low pedestals, on simple
tables, in corners and near to the ﬂoor. Somc pieces
look like mathematical equations put into practice,
others vaguely resemble body parts. Some appear to
be functional ﬂower baskets, while others defy de»
scription.

But they are all made in the same medium, with
the same discipline. Though the pieces are sturdy
and perfectly proportioned, the artists use no glues,
adhesives or measuring tape in the process. Bamboo
baskets have been made in Japan for thousands of
years and recently have come to be seen as a distinct
art form.

Though the pieces in this collection draw upon
a long craft tradition, each piece has its own char—
acter. in recent decades, craftwork has lost some of
its Japanese market to mass—manufactured products.
American collectors have supported artists and artie
sans by collecting bamboo crarts as art, and the na-
ture and functionality of the pieces vary accordingly.

Bamboo art “is a testament to the cultural ate
titudes that make such demanding work possible,
said Donald Doe, Art, one of the co-curators of the
exhibit. ’At the same time, these pieces can be read
by anybody."

The diversity of pieces in the show reﬂects the
history ofbamboo weaving, some are made by mem-
bers of the Japanese Crafts Association, others by
members of the Japanese Fine Arts Association and
some by independent artists. “Lots of these artists
don’t have formal arts education,”said Rob Cofﬂand,
another co—curator and gallery owner from New
Mexico “You can’t figure out who’s who, and that
makes it that much more astonishing."

For eight years, Cofﬂand has searched out Japa—
nese bamboo art for collectors. Doe ambled into
Cofﬂand‘s Tai Gallery in Santa Fe, where some of
his finds were displayed, and was moved.

“I spent a long time looking at their technical
brilliance and variety," said Doe “I saw eight or 10
pieces, and that was enough to convince me that
some kind ofcxhibit should come to Grinncll."Doe
discussed the idea with Cofﬂand,and the exhibit be-
gan to come together.

After several phone calls, 18 of Cofﬂand’s art
collector clients loaned pieces. The pieces made
their way to Faulconer Gallery in simple birch boxes,
which are incorporated as pedestals in the exhibit.

these boxes with grey walls and intense lighting to
put together a dramatic, spare display “I was con-
scious of a traditional Japanese aesthetic in arrange
ing the pieces," said Severe. “Without aping that, I
tried to let it guide me,"

With the distinct aesthetic of bamboo art in
mind, Severe put a lot of thought into the arrange
ment ofthe exhibitr “Because there were no lighting
requirements for this show,l could blast the pieces
with light and make them very dramatic," he said.
“Some orthem cast very striking shadows."

Adding to the air of purpose in the exhibit, he
arranged the gallery into different sections with di-
viding walls. “These walls are a nod to Japanese shoji
screens, and I tried to keep the ﬂow harmonious
from one section to the next." he said.

severe planned for a tatami mat, upon which the
piece Born by MondenYuichi is set, as a spaccror
visiting artists to perform and do demonstrations In
the gallery “We dont make spaces like this for most
exhibits, but this lent itself to that," said Severe

Many events are planned to take place in this
space and around the art building. Nakatomi Hiijime,
one of the bamboo artists in the exhibit, will visit as
an artist in residency. While here, he will also visit
Grinnell Japanese classes, local public school classes
and the JapansAmerica society in Des Moinss,

He will be part ora Japan Festival in the Bucks
baum Rotunda on Feb. 25, which will feature other
interactive events. Koto playerJoanna Pecorc will give
a demonstration, and visitors will be able to make
onigiti, or rice balls wrapped in bamboo leaves.

Finally, an ikebana, or Japanese ﬂower arrange-
ment, master from Chicago will give a demonstra-
tion and a workshop in March. “At these events,
anybody with an interest in Japanese culture can get
a glimpse of it," said Curator of Education at Faul—
coner Gallery Karla Neihus. “The visiting artists are
carrying on traditional practices and adjusting them
to a contemporary world."

Faulconer showcases structural design today

av MERRICK MEYERS

Years ago, students in David Bile
lington's course saw beauty in struce
tures such as the Brooklyn Bridge and
the Eiﬂfel tower, not the traditional
buildings he planned to discuss. It,
was a generation gap Billington tried
to cross and even master.

Since then, he has shared his stu-
dents' passions, focusing on structural
engineering as art. He has taught
structural design at Princeton since
1974,wzote related books and curated
several exhibits on the topic.

Now, his most recent exhibit,
“The Art. of Structural Design: A
Swiss Legacy," focusing on four Swiss
architects, has come to Grinnell. Or-
ynized by the Princeton University
Art Museum and the Princeton Unis
vetsity Department of Civil and Enr
vironmental Engineering, the exhibit
will open today in the Faulconer gal-
lery and run until Apt. 16.

It is a common mistake to think of
structural engineering as architecture,
Billington said. As quoted in the New
York Timer Book Review, he likens
structural engineering to poetry and
architecture to prose. Structural art,
he says in his book Tow”: andBn'dgcr
is a “new art form, parallel to archi-
tecture” that arose from the Industrial
Revolution,

Billington said that he sees struc»
tural engineering, while based on
scientiﬁc principles, as being more a
form of art than science, It is based on
“principles of design, not principles of
discovery”

William case, Physics, noted
a fundamental diﬁuence between
structural design and architecture: a
structural designer building a bridge
must always consider practical mats
ters of engineering first and then ap-
ply aesthetie considerations, while in
architecture the opposite is often true.
The most important thing is that the
strucnire works “Just because' its the
21st century doesnt mean gravity has
gone away, said Case

Case, who has known Billington
for 20 years, once worked with one
of the exhibit’s featured engineers
while on sabbatical. He said the art of

structural engineering is of so much
interest because of the “beauty of in-,
novation, an elegant way of doing
things "

“There are many different pos-
sibilities of thing's that would work,
that would stay up, but [an artist
will] choose something that not only
works as a bridge, holds whatever
the loads are up, survives a long time
and isn’t overly expensive, but on top
of that is beautiful to look at, is very
appealing,” said Case.

The exhibit contains models of
eight examples of structural art by
four architects. Four of Billington’s
students built these models. The
four featured architects — Rob—
ert Maillart, Othmar H. Ammann,
Heinz Islet and Christian Menn
—- were all educated at Eidgenos—
sische Technische Hochschule
(Federal Institute of Technology)
in Zurich, Switzerland. There, rhey
were particularly inﬂuenced by two
teachers, Wilhelm Ritter and Pierre
Lardy. Billington calls the ETH the
best school of structural engineering
in the world. Their works include all
major New York city bridges and
the recent Boston bridge.

The exhibit came to Grinnell at
the suggestion of Case, who is teach-
ing the special topic course “Bridges,
Towers, and Skyscrapers." Billings
ton, as the Noyce Visiting Piofes-
sor, gave three lectures last week to
Case’s class, and will return for three
more the week before Spring Break.
While he was here, he also gave
a lecture in the cinema on Jan. 26
about the exhibit.

“It is interesting how [Billing-
ton] defines structural design difr
ferently than art or architecture or
something about physics, l-Ie deﬁnes
it in the middle of all three," said
Nate Gates ’08, a student in Case’s
special topic course.

The exhibit, conceived by Bil—
lington ﬁve years ago, made its de-
but at Princeton in 2003i Since then
it has toured to MIT, Kansas City,
Switzerland and Toronto. After
Grinnell, the exhibit’s next and last
stop will be Swift College.
