Kase said that his favorite activity is ”vice." For
the sake of his mother, he did not elaborate, tee
marking eryprirally that he has “had a radio show

basketball, and ison Intramural teams for both spam.

Kase can relate to the

through memories ofhis
own harrowing rhildhood experiences. “I did get

Life as a mugwump

Several career paths interest Shaun Southwor’th, including
public policy. But his immediate plan is to go to Chicago and relax.

“I'm fascinated with I’EZ [candies], because
[they’re] such a perfect model ofcapitalism,” said
Shaun Southworth. “The stuff inside is pure
sugar; it dorsnr taste good, but it's all about the
packaging." He smiled. “So i like to collect PEZ,”

tivated by words.

“Words absolutely fascinate me." he said. “I
particularly like prepositions. i know that sounds
extraordinarily dorky, but it’s true."

Southworth hopes to someday possibly ex-
ercise his interest in words as a writer. “I sup-
pose that, like most English majors, i always have
that part of me in the back ofmy head that tells
me I want to bc a wrrrer someday, but I’m very
concerned about people responding to my voice,"
he said, “I frequently write poetry or short sro.

I’ll open it up."

“Right now I’m plannrng to become s mugr
wump," he said with a smile. “I plan to movt to
Chiergo in January; I plan to start playing my
Freneh born again, stsrr swimming, rbrrk our
all ofthe museums in Chicago and get a job."

Southwotth transferred to Grinnell from

Sheridan college in the fall of 2001. “Grinnell
is a mneh more academically rigorous institu.
rion [than Sheridan]," he said wrrh a laugh. “i
derided to... transfer to a nationally ranked lib.
eral arts rollege and I ended up rhoesrng Grin-
nell over Amherst beranse or its rural location.
l'm originally from Wyoming and I felt more
comfortable living in Iowa... overall, my Grin-
nell experience has been wonderful.”

Southwotth looks forward to graduating and
leaving the Grim-tell bubble, however. “I feel that
1 am suited to leave Grinnell and explore the
world outside of this. i haven't really decided
what i want to do yet, but i feel I'm starting to
learn more about myself and what I want... I
have my entire life in from ofrne; I‘ll probably
make more than one career change."

For now, southworrh plans to settle in Chk
eago and become involved with public serviee
or public poliry. “What I hope to be doing in a
year is working rorTeaeh for America," he said.
“I come from a working poor family, and
throughout my life teachers have always pushed
me to the next level. I’m absolutely eonvinrrd
that students who arrrnd underrrcsoutccd

like to return the gift ofliterarure and the ability
