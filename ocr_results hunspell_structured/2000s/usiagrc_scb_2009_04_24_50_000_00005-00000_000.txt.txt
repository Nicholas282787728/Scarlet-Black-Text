AJust Grinnell:

Two new members ofA Just Grinnell, Rashawn Sims
’12 and Nichole Baker ’10, described their future ambitions
as well as the group's many achievements this year, espe-
cially since their last Trustee presentation in early Febru-
ary,

A Just Grinnell is "currently doing a pilot program with
workshops" addressing injustices at Grinnell College, Sims
said. These include a workshop on racism two weeks ago
and another on classism this weekend. Indeed, it was at
the racism workshop that Sims became interested in and
involved with the group.

On a larger scale, the group hosted a November retreat,
attended by so people, and
a spring break retreat with
40 participants, including
a school-sponsored profes-
sionitl moderator. While
this is a student-run pro—
gram, flown-in facilitators
can cost thousands of dol-
lars, requiring Trustee and
administrative support.

Baker tied this semester’s
successes with the program’s
overall goals.

“The reason this pilot program is [happening] like we
said [is because] we want this peer education program to
be institutionalized at Grinnell," Baker said. “We want evr
ery student who comes through Grinnell to have a basic
understanding of privilege and oppression in general and
speciﬁcally how it acts at Grinnell."

No Limits Project:

Four students—Joe Hiller '12, Rachel Smith ’11, Virr
ginia Andersen '10 and Alex Conlon '097represented the
No Limits Project. Their discussion revolved around their
message, movement, and motivations.

In general, "the No Limits Project wants accountability
and transparency on issues of social responsibility," Smith
said. The group referred to the 14 de

mands listed on its website, emphasiz-
ing the costrneutral ones.

The group also focused on the long
history behind many of the demands,
“Some students have been working on
these projects for almost their full four
years that they have been here. Stu-
dents, faculty and staffhave been work-
ing on this for more than a decade,"
Conlon said.

The group also addressed their un-
orthodox approach as a student group,

particularly
their decir
sion to not register as an official
student organization. “We are
working as best we can through
[institutional] and maybe less
traditional approaches.” Conlon
said,

Before voicing their demands,
members noted that their motir
vation “is mostly because we love
Grinnell and we want it to be a
better place and we think that it

can be a better place," Smith said.

“But we think that Grinncll as an institution really
needs to support what we say we support. A lot ofstudents
have been really active in getting programs that do this but
we have found that students come against a brick wall in
these project,"5mith said.

the February open forum, students Ari Anisfeld ’09,]ared

progress in setting goals for raising the investment stan-

dards of the College,

The group seeks to encourage the College to use its
power as a signiﬁcant share-
holder in many publicly traded
companies in a way that encour-
ages socially responsible busi-
ness practices.

‘ln the '80s, Grinnell joined
the international movement to
divest from South Africa and
helped end apartheid," said An-
‘ isfeld, who is an editor for the
Rachel Smith’ll soda.

The group is currently advo-
cating that the College approve
shareholder resolutions up for
vote, which would compel Wale
Mart to include gender identity and expression in its ofr
ficial nondiscrimination policy.

“We’ve been researching various shareholder resolur
(ions for this term,”Goff said.

The group’s chief proposal was the establishment of a
committee to oversee how well the College’s investment
practices align with its stated values of social justice, The
committee would include membership from students,
Trustees and College administrators.

“The committee would be made up, we propose, of
four students, Treasurer David Clay and Investment Ana-
lyst Paige Carlson at the Treasurer’s Office, both ofwhom
we've worked with thc last few years on this campaign, and
two members of the board of Trustees who would not be
required to come [to] any meetings but would be kind of
ourTrustee liaisons," Rubinstein said

One Trustee questioned the feasibility and efficiency of
considering the thousands of shareholder resolutions that
could come before the Committee. SR1 members, however,
contended that the Committee would only target a few
of the more salient resolutions and focus their efforts on
those
