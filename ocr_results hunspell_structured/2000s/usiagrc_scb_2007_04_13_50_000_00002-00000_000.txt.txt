On April 4, CBS’radio talks
show host Don Imus for racially
charged commcnrt hc nradc during
on his show about the Rutgers Univer
sity women's basketball team. Imus, who is a member ofthe
National Broadcaster Hall of Fame, made the comments
during a critique of the appearance of the Rutgers plays
crs. highlighting the tattoos of some and ciilling'the team
“nappy-headed hos". Imus has since apologized for the com»
ments but his showwas, nonetheless, discontinued.

lmus's comments sparked an outrage as numerous View
ers and commentators, considering Imus’s suspension in-
sufﬁcient prrnislnnent, called for rhe complete rcnroval of
the career journalist. The Rev, Al Shurpron and Rev. Jesse

‘ Jackson even met with CBS President and Chief Exeeue
, rive otheer Leslie Moonves to urge the removal or Imus.
, Most calling for his firing have emphasized the need to hold

public figures accountable given their disproportionate ins
ﬂuence on the public. Others have suggested that the com-

l ments might negatively affect young children,

A minority of observers, while disapproving or Imlls's
action, has criticized the move to ﬁre Imus as unreasonably
bowmg to public pressure. His removal constitutes at best,
a cowardly move to placate the public and maintain viewers
ship and, at worsr outright Censorship. A more appropriate
response thev say, would be for critics to promote a boycott

. of lmiis’s show.

I do find his comments
deeply offensive, however,
I think rhere’s a rendency
in our culture to overrer
act to the most shocking
events,while more danger-
ous, subtle prejudices go
undetected.

As a broadcaster, he
is a public persona and
one staremenr can and
should mean losing his
job.

I don't agree with what he
said, but he shouldn't get fired for
saying one bad thing.

“Buseum” visits Grinnell

Bv ARI ANISFELD

Even the most casual students of history are familiar with
the internment u{JapaneserAmeticans dining World War II.
Yet few know about the experience of the over 15,000 Gcrr
man-American civilians interned sunulraneously in the United
States. Likely, even fewer are aware ofthe 4,058 Germans who
were kidnapped from Sourh America and interned in the Unit-
ed States. A “buseum” recently visited Grinnell in the hopes of
remedying the public ignorance,

A inuscuni on a bus, entitled “Vanished: German—American
Interninent, 194148", is currently tiaveling acioss the Mid-
wcsLTlic exhibit consists of 10 panels and two documentaries
highlighting rhe experience ofintcrned Ger-maneAmerieuns.

Emily Meade '07, a member of the advisoiy board fol the
Center of Piairie Studies, which co-sponsored the event with
rhe Peace Studies Program and the German dcpartnictit,fotlnd
the exhibit particularly interesting given the relative obscurity
ofthc issue. “The concept is really neat," she s-did. And the date-
line documentary “helped ro tie rhe exhibit together."

The bus was starred byTruces. a nonprofit educational or.

ganization which, according to its website, prescnt[s] the sto-
ries of people {mm the Midwest and Germany or Austria who
encountered each other during World War II "

John Andelson, Anthropology, Director of the Center for
Prairie Studies, felt the exhibit was timely because of the lessons

he bClICVCS were not learned from the experiences ofVVorld War
II, For him. GermantAmencan internment is “uncomfortably
similar to what [has been] occurring in the U S since Septcmr
ber 11. Though rhe exhibit does not address this issue direerly,
Reynolds said some ofthe panelists drew parallels.

Aadelson, who contacted lraces after receiving a rip from a
member orrh'e library faculty, said rhat the issue is particularly
relevant to the Grinnell area, “The Center for Prairie Studies
is interested in the history and culture afthe legion, and [Get-
man~Amerlcan internment] is a very little known part or it,"
said ,Andelson. At irs three stops, the buseum arrraered close
to 400 people

Thomas Bateman'10,who attended the exhibitwith liisln»
termedrate German class, taught by Dan Reynolds, felt the ex.
hibitwas ”prettysobering,cspccially the part about the kidnaps
ping from Latin America. He was “appalled" that the United
States“ never made a formal apology to these people"

Accompanying the narratives of the bus was a panel led
open discussion The panel which consisted ofMichciel Luick—
.Thrams, rhe director ofTraces, Reynolds, and other cemmuniry
members, discussed rhe implications and lessons of the buses
um.

For Reynolds, the emphasis of the discussion “was to look
at a pattern of behavior [in histoiy...and to] try to derive what
lessons one could learn."
