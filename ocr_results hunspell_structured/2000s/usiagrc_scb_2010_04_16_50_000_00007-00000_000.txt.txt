Elephant Micah plays to packed, studious Bob’s

BY ELIZA LEAS

During this tour, Elephant Micah has played every
where from the office of an internet start-up to a barn on
a commune, But rarely does he fit in as well as he did in
Bob's Underground cafe where his smart lyrics perfectly
complemented a quiet but crowded concert.

Elephant Micah’s Tuesday night performance came just
after MarkTrecka and Elizabeth Remis.This was the first
stop for Trecka and Reinis, whojoined on the sixth week of
Elephant Micah’s nine week tour.

“We were quick to take the opening slot because Ele
ephant Micah, he’s a hard act to follow,"Trecka said,

Trecka and Remis' opening show began by establishing
an almost funeral atmosphere. For more than three min-
utes, Trecka hummed along with his tabletop quasi accor-
dion for an ethereal, enveloping sound that the reporter
could not quite shake.

Remis played the violin while Trecka sang and although
most of what he was saying got lost, intentionally or oth-
erwise, it sounded good—soulful, heartfelt, as if there was
some deﬁnite emotion behind the drawn-out syllables.

The duo have played Grinnell before, as part ofa thief
person band.

"We're twocthirds ofa band called Pillars and Tongues.
We‘re also two-halves of a band called Mark Trecka and
Beth Remis,"Trecka said, nearing the end of the set.

Elephant Micah, a band composed ot’joseph O’Connell
and his guitar, would deﬁnitely have been a hard act to {01*
low, By the end ofhis ﬁrst song. 20 or 30 people had filled
Bob’s, and most were listening to his folksy, lyrical music,
“Paintings are the work ofthe untrained miiid/ so I stare
at your still lit’e/ as if it were wild," sang Elephant Micah’s
O’Connell.

He played a revised version of “Ramblin’ Woman,” a
song by an old Appalachian singer, Hazel Dickens, which
sounded notably different coming out of a deepevoealed
man’s mouth. Elephant Micah had an easy Voicc thoughY
not trying too hard or singing too loud, just telling us, ale
beit broodingly, about his perspectives, He fit right in with
the gossiping chatter and keyboard typing, lulling listeners
Without overpowering them.

Elephant Micah draws some ofhis inﬂuence from Joni

Jazz legend comes to perform at Grinnell

EYEMILY EAJET

Toni Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald and John Coltrane all
played with him and tonight Grinnell’s Jazz Ensemble will
too,1n addition to lending his musical experience and tal-
ent to the College’s Jazz Ensemble concert tonight, Marcus
Beigrave, a seasoned jazz legend on the trumpet, will also
teach a jazz improvisation workshop this afternoon.

“Every year we try to bring one person in, an_ artist of
national acclaim, and this year I ended up settling on Mars
cus Belgrave," said Jazz Ensemble Director and Professor
ofMusic Damani Phillips. “He’s been around forever [and]
he's played with just about every great that we think otand
we discuss nowadays in terms of jazz history,"

Though they may not be instantly familiar with his
name, many Grinnellians are more ramiliar than they know
with Belgrave’s sound. “Everybody who has ears to hear
has heard him,”Tad Boehmer’lZ said. "But they just don't
know that it’s him, His trumpet’s well known."

While here, Belgrave will provide an improvisation
workshop in Bucksbaum room 152 By bringing a master
of the skill to Grinnell, Phillips hopes to introduce begine
ners to the art ofjazz improvisation outside of an academic
setting and provide a more one on one learning experience.

“One of the cornerstones ofjazz is learning to improc
vise and it's basically spontaneous composition with the
backdrop ofa familiar tune, or a chord progression,"l>hile
lips said. “This is one of the masters of this particular skill
[and] I wanted to make sure that while he was here he
shared some of his strategies with the students,"

The workshop, at 12:30 in Bucksbaum 152, is geared
towards melodic instrumentalists such as trumpeters, saxo~
phonists and guitarists. student musicians will be encoure
aged to actively participate in improvisation with their
instruments, but the workshop is open to everyone, instruc
mentalist or not.

The concert itself, which will be at 7 p.m. tonight in
SebringeLewisovill not only feature jazz improvisation but
also complex arrangments chosen by Belgrave himself.

“Everything that we're playing at the concert is come
posed or arranged by Thad Joncsttdt the request of our
guest artist Marcus Belgravc," Jackie Ernst ’11 said. “It's
very challenging [and] it's the hardest concert i've ever
been involved in, [but] it’s a really exciting opportunity to
play with such a talented, famous musician."

While Belgrave will provide the majority of the improe
visational solos throughout the hourrlong concert, Ernst

will also contribute a singing scat solo—or vocal improvi»
sation—during one or the pertormanee pieces.

Boehmer is also excited to play alongside such a tal—
ented musician, and believes the combined efforts of the
jazz ensemble and jazz master Belgrave will create a great
experience for the performers and audience alike.

"Jones' music really shows the wide range of musical
styles and emotions that he was able to bring about in this
writing," Boehmer said. “We’re all very passionate about
the music, so to be able to add [Belgrave] into it plus how
much we like it, it's just going to be fantastic."

The college ensemble has been practicing since Janus
ary, and hopes the culmination oftheir efforts tonight will
show all of their hard work and dedication.

“This concert represents a signiﬁcant amount of work
for the students," Phillips said, “I hope that rolks.,.recoge
nize and respect the amount of time and work and energy
that these students have devoted into making this concert
happen, [and] i hope that they consider coming out and
sharing in it with us. It will become overtly clear when
you experience the music the love and the passion and the
enjoyment that the students have for what they’re doing,"
