With late March and early April snow ﬂurrics; the hnsehull team has heen
relegated to pmcticing and competing in indoor venues—not exactly conducive to
real game situations, After coming back from a successful training trip in Florida,
the baseball team has gained experience, conﬁdence and sweet tan lines.

The Pioneers faced l)0[l\ conference and nourconfercncc competition in their
ten—game road trip. Ending with a 73 record for the trip, many of the games were
high scoring, including n 204 win against crown College, a 154 win against
Earlliain College, and a 770 win in Lawrence University

Whilc than: were deﬁnite standout pcrronners, speciﬁcally Padcn Rodcr '10,
Ben Mendoza ‘09,and Greg Suryn ‘11, the Pioneers attribute their offensive sues
cess to their depth ofbats,“The nice thing about our lineup is that we have a lot of
guys that can hit well so when one orour top guys is having a bad day somebody
in the hack can pick them up,"saitl Ryan Fletcher’ll. “We also had a lot or good
pitching. All our pitchers did well, but Harris was lights out."

Pitcher Ryan Harris ’10 was named this week’s Midwest Conference Men's
Baseball Performer of the Week after garnering a perfect 0.00 ERA, over the trrp,
Harris pitched a total of 13 innings and was the Winning pitcher in two games.

Though the Pioneers have strong hats and quick gloves, many of the trouble
header contests ended up being split. “It's mainly due to a lack ot’focus,” Fletcher
said, “because we deﬁnitely have the talent to win but sometimes we just don’t
bring it as much as we can, and then sometimes the bounces just don’t go youi
wa .

yWith seasoned talent on the team, for the first-year class, of which there are 12
playing on the team this year, the tiip to Florida really meant getting signiﬁcant
playing time in their first collegiate games. “Obviously, the trip ms a good bond-
ing experience for everybody and then on the team you get a Little hit better ofa
view of what your role is going to be," said catcher Mike Nodzcnski '12. “It was
deﬁnitely a good experience for the freshmen because everybody got playing time
and you know sometimes that won't be the case later in the year,"

Fletcher agreed, adding that the volume ofgamcs will honor prepare the team
for conference play. “But I think it’s nice that we have that many games they have
a chance to get in there and really feel it out so when conference comes around
they’re not like deer in headlights,” Fletcher said.
