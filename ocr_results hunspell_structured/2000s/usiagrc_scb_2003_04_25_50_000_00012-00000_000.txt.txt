AHHH. . . . YOUNG LOVE.

1 On April 25, 1901, New York became the first
state to reouire automobile license plates, for
$1 each( (or about :20 today)

in an effort to reduce trafﬁc congestion, london introduced last
month a £5 charge for all cars entering central london dunno pare
ticularly busy hours of the week. Similar plans have already been
introduced in Oslo and Singapore, but London’s charges are by far
the highest.

It's illegal to bring gum into Singapore, or to buy or sell it while
you’re there. The ban was enacted in 1992, in an effort to reduce
the large deposits of chewed gum that had accumulated in sub.
ways. (Though its perfectly legal to chew gum if you can somehow
get a hold of it.)

There's no chocolatecﬂavored chewing gum because the cocoa butter
in chocolate acts as an emulsiﬁer on the chevinng gum base, mak
ing it too soft to chew satisfactorily.

Chocolate is assodated vinth romance because it was long thought
to be an aphrodisiac: Montezuma, who introduced chocolate to
Europe by way of Hernan Cortéz, supposedly drank fifty cups of hot
chocolate every day, and legendary lover Casanova swore by it as
well. Unfortunately, chocolate merely contains caffeine and an.
other mildly addictive stimulant called theobromine, which pro.
videan energy boostand—likesexireleases pleasure-causing sub
stances into the brain.

Greek folk tradition holds lettuce to be an antiaphtodisiac, lie—
cause it is ”cold and moist/La sort of internal cold shower. The
Pythagoreans, a Greek cabal who believed that sex during hot
weather was dangerous, recommended that young people and mate
ned couples eat salad every day in July and August.

The Pythagoreans, best remembered for their theorem about right
triangles, also believed in numerology and reincarnation. They did
not wear animal skins, for fear of killing old friends, and they did
not eat beans. because they thought beans smelled like semen.

One of the most common appearances of numerology in the last
century has been a series _of calculations of the date of Jesus
return. Various individuals and religious groups have predicted the
rapture on 25 separate occasions in the 20th century.

The Jehovah's Witnesses, a radical Christian sect espousing de-
tachment from the physical world, are thought to hold the record
forthe most incorrect predictions of the second coming ofiesus of
Nazareth with nine: 1874, 1878, 1881, 1910, 1914, 1918, 1925,
1975 and 1984

in 1977, in Wooley v. Moynord, the u. 5. Supreme Court ruled that
the government could not force citizens to publicly support views
they found abhorrent. The case came from a family orJehovahs
witnesses living in New Hampshire who had shipped the states

Courting your
future employer

, demiy dill/id
will work for food

Now that you've found the jobs you want to apply rot
and have sent oirthosc resumes, it might seem like things
are pretty much out ofyour control. For all intents and Pure
poses, you're future employment is in God’s hands now; all
you can do is sit by the mailroom and wait. And hope. And
dream.

However, while you’re waiting and hoping and dream.
ing. some other pitce-of-shﬂ college see
nior is trying to take your goddamn job
and ifyou want it badly enough, you're
gonna need to get ofiyourass and make
it happen This is nota time to be timid.
The economy is going to hell in a hand
basket and if you don't get that yob.
you'll end up turning tricks on L80
come May ZOKIL

That said, do not be alarmed, there
are plenty of things that you can do to
stack the deck in your favor. For cit.
ample, l've been calling my various job
sites on a daily basis. 1 rind it useful yust to check in, see if
they’ve read my resume yet, and ask how things are going in
their lives. While my resume has managed to capture my
accomplishments, in general, these phone conversations are
where I get to shine. They demonstrate that I'm a go-gcttcr.
A people person. The kind of guy who is ready to go the
cxtra mile

Yet, on some days, people scent a little reluctant to chat.
They claim to have “work to do" or request that I “quit huc
rassing them", however, that’s rust their way of testing my
commitment to the job. And that's when I pull out all the
stops. since calling them at work seems inconvenient, I've

ends but, calling's not all you can do!

Once the phone calls seem to be getting a little old, it's
time to start mailing supplementary materials, Perhaps you
might send a scented note, wrshrng the person a good day,
Or. maybe, a personal photograph that manages to capture
your individual charm. For example, last week, i mailed an
alluring photograph of myself to the president of a come
pany I want to work at. On one level, I think the prctutc
manages to communicate my attention to detail: while the
other kids were offstudymg, l was at Maytag getting rid of
those sloppy looking tan lines. On an.
other level, it enhances my resume,
making me stand out among the other
applicants. 1 mean ifa namewith a face

ass could do for you:

Afterall orthyc calls have been made
and all the asses have been mailed its
time to go in for the kill rhc employer
is tired and weak '1 he job will soon be
yours. All yoti have to do is go in for
the kill.

In this phase oftht hiring process,
1 think it’s important to give the employer a sense of the
hellfire that shall be unleashed should they fail to hire you
for that position. For instance, try mailing them road kill or
dismembcrcdparbie dolls. While nota direct threat to their
personal well being, these obiezis remind the employer or
rust how desperate you really are And everybody knows
there's nothing worse than racing the wrath orsomeonc with
nothing left to lose.

Although this process of calling, mailing, and tcrrorir,

result you'll get. When push comes to shove, you'll be ime
