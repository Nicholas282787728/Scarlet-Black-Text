Student Affalrs tivc liberal arts college and, more

from p. 1 importantly than that, who want
to he at a place like Grinneii whcre selfsgovernance is such a
hig part orthings,"Greene said,

In light of the midyear departures or sinounker RLC Jirn
McCarthy and Clangmla RLC Rachel Mcscke, Greene has
also taken into account the candidates'levcl of Commitment to
Grinnell.“1’m conﬁdent that we’ll be able to get a very strong
group of RLCs who not only get Grinnell but will be here be—
cause orir. And that's not a slight or slain against Rachel or Jim
or anyone else who’s leftiThey’ve all had valid reasons for doing
that," Greene said. “But I think we can be more intentional
about finding that ﬁt earlier on so We don't have issues later."

McCarthy left in December for family reasons. Mcsckc left
in February for an administrative position at Roosevelt Univer-
sity in Chicago. Along with filling the openings caused by the
midyear departures, Greene will ﬁll positions for RLCs who are
not returning next year.

Northeast Campus RLC Chris Bylone will be leaving after
this year based on a mutual dcciswn reached with Greene and
Dougharty. “It was an ongoing conversation [ with Greene and
Doughirty] ahout, ‘is this the right fit {or rno> Is Grinncll the
right fit for you? And we came to an agreement that Grinnell's

- nor the right in for me and I’m not the tight at for Grinnell,"

Bylone said.“And it's time toi me to move on."

In response to Bylone’s departure, Greene emphasized the
connection between an RLC’s ﬁr With Grinnell and trust from
the student body.

“I think when you think about ‘ﬁt' in general, it does involve
a sense of trust and it does have to be earned and it does have
to be nurtured," Greene said."So what I would say is Chris has
done some good things for this Campus but he's also the first to.
admit that it's been a struggling year tor hint,"

Bylonc also expressed , nahility to continue at Grinneli
because ofhis strained relationship with the student body, “In
September, it's a very well-known fact that I husted two parties
that happened in Rose Lounge that did not have an alcohol
contract [and] that put me rubbing against the student body,"
Bylone said.

“Nloving Grinncll forward, making Grinnell grow, is not
something I can do because I'm not trusted.”

Southeast RLC Jennifer Bienieck will not return next year
because she has stayed the threeycar maximum allowed for
RLCs. “I will not be returning. I did inquire about renirning
for a fourth year," Bicncck wrote in an email to the SéfE,“My
three years is up: I do not have the option to return."

Jamaland RLC Brenda Hunt, who has been on medical
leave this semester, has not Conﬁrmed whether or not she will
be staying next year. In an interview with the 5533, she declined
to comment.

Greene did not make a deﬁnitive statement. ”No decision
will be shared or made until she's back from leave," he said.

Although many RLCs will not be returning next year,
HindstBrush's new posuion and Lau’s promotion will ensure
that institutional memory will not he lost

“Having people like Katie and Kim be in the department is
going to be so essential hecause they have a proven track record
or being successful woiking with students, having the trust of
the students built in,"Greene said.

According to Greene, lrlinds-Bnish’s new position will
build on her cuirent role as RLC and Assistant Director of
Residence Life “So the position itself, we’re working all that
our, the logistics," Greene said “But she'll he doing a lot with
advising ofstudcnt groups. so she'll continue to advise Lyle's,
Bob’s, SGA She'll be doing a lot ofthc administrative piece of
iesidence ic.’

Along with restructuring Residence Life positions and hir-
ing new RLCs, the search for a new Associate Dean has been
in progress, On Tuesday, candidate Troy seppeit presented in
front oi'campus and met with students at a dinner. Next week,
students Will have the opportunity to meet candidates Tasha
Yulcs and Andrea Connor.

“I'm real excited about the candidates that we’ve brought
an,"crceiie said.“Troy [seppeltl seemed to be well received by
many. And I think that as the students and the rest of the toms
munity getto .ncetTasha [Yules] and Andrea [Conner], they're
going to be really impressed as well."
