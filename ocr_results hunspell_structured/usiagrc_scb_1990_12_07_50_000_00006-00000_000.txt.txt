Late in Search,
Students Must
Inﬂuence Outcome

Yesterday the Presidential
Search Committee announced its
three finalists for the opening
position of President of the college.
Unfortunately, now that the search
is open, students will have little
input before the ﬁnal decision is made.

The length of his presentation will be only one hour, not all of which
will be used for questioning. This lack of timefor studenu to meet and
evaluate the ﬁnalists is a serious error on the part of the committee.
However, at this pointand time, unless more time for meeting students is
provided, we must cope with the current schedule.

Considering the visits will occuriheweek before cxarns,many students
will have to sacriﬁce study time in order to meet the ﬁnalists. Students are
urged do so because of the important ramiﬁcations of the selection.

It is crucial that students use the opportunity to inﬂuence the ﬁnal
decision since they have had little chance to inﬂuence then process thus
far. This has been a grave error, but the past cannot be changed.

With all likelihood. a new president will be selected when students
return in January. There is only one week to evaluate the candidates and
students must take advantage of this opportunity, despite the flawed
system.

Return the Mugs
. Campus Demonstrating

Failed Committment

Dining Services announced an
ambitiousnewplanatthebeginning
of the semester to reduce the waste
produced by disposable products.
Dave McConnell introduced
“permanentware” during the New
Students Days Picnic and urged the campus to join him in the campaign
to help, the environment.

Only with sludentsupport, he said, will the projectsucceed. If students
did not return the reusable mugs and cups, the college would return to
styrofoam.

Now, four months later, it is clear that the students have failed to fulﬁll
their responsibility, Few, if any, mugs remain in the Fomm Grill. Most
sit in student rooms, forgotten and unrctumed. Many students use the
yellow mugs as their own personal coffee cups, only taking them back
when a refill is needed. The mugs are then promptly removed from the
premises.

Dining Services only purchased 350 plastic mugs. If the Grill is to
maintain its commitment to the environment, the mugs cannot be
appropriated for individual use. They must be rctumod.

Reusable items may be rotumcd to Dining Services in the Forum Grill,
Cowles and Quad Dining Halls and the second floor of Burling. In
addition, collection boxes should be set up in each hall. Perhaps the
Environmental Interest Group could return these recyclables to Dining
Services when it collects paper.

Grinncll students were responsible for encouraging Dining Services to
make a committment to recycling. Students should now maintain that
commitment by returning the mugs.

Isl-:1'I'EBS TO THE EDITOR
Student Furious that Mugs
Not Returned to Forum Grill

To the editor,

l atn writing in regard to the
Forum's new policy this semester
to eliminate styrofoam from the
Grill and to instead reuse a set
number of glasses and encourage
students to buy special mugs for
which they receive a discount on
theirpurchascs. TheGrill has given
students every opportunity to make
this policy effective, including
placing bins for the glasses at both
dining halls and most recently. on
the second ﬂoor of Burling, and
was generous in agreeing to adopt
this proposal in the first place.

The students who have unfairly
and selﬁshly taken advantage of
this generosity by monopolizing the
campus glasses are toblame for the
factthat only three mugs were left
today, Tuesday. at the Grill. They
hadtobecontinually washedwhich
is unfair to the workers, It won’tbe
long before all of the mugs are
gone. ls it really so difﬁcult to
retum property that doesn 't belong
to you? This college and. in alarger
respect, world, belongs to all of us.
We need to share itsresources, and
recycling is a big part of this
endeavor. It is sad that a few are so
inconsiderate as to forget this fact.

Grinnell prides itselfon being a
liberal and politically active
campus. Everyone is concerned
with the environment and
conservation of natural resources.
Granted, perhaps there has been

Hero Milk Should Be
Example to All People

To the editor,

I received, in response to' my
letter to the Scarlet and Black last
week, an anonymous letter. includ
ing some news clippings concem~
ing the deaths of [San Francisco
Supervisor] Harvey Milk and
[Mayor] George Moscone.

, While the respondent corrected
some factual errors in my letter,
and rightly so, the clippings failed
to refute my claim that the signs
concerning Milk’stmgicdeath were
alarmistand incorrect. The articles
underscored the political differ-
ences between Milk, Moscone and
Supervisor Dan White, their assas-
sin. Thescdifferences extended far
beyond the city‘s treatment or the
gaycommunity: they encompassed
most questions of city governance
The fights between the liberals (led
by Moscone), and White, the lone
conservative member of the Board
of Supervisors, were legend.

The fact thatMoscone,a hetero-
sexual, was killed before Milk,
stresses the essentially political
nature of the killings. Milk was
identiﬁed by City Hall observers as
being Moscone’sclosestally. Other
supervisors, like Dianne Feinstein,
were liberal but nevertheless by-
passed the lancor of the Moscone—
White disputes and sought con-
sensus. It is likely thatMilk, had he
been heterosexual, would havebccn
gunned down anyway, so vociferr
ous was his support of White's enr
cmy, Moscone.

The truly unfortunate aspect of
Harvey Milk’s death is that his po-
litical courage was robbed from us

so quickly. He serves as a model
for people who seeks to enter pub
lic life, regardless of their sexual
orientation. Milk, undoubtedly, is
much much more to members of
the gay community, but that does
not give them the right to co-opt
him or his example.

As a liberal, Midwcslent Demo
crat, do i have the right to deny
others the inspiration and courage
of Hubert Humphrey or Henry

Zoeckler's

Information
Inaccurate

To the editor,

I am responding to Evan L.
Zoeckler’s letter about Harvey
Milk's death. Milk did not die in
the mayor‘s ofﬁce as Zoeckler
claims. In facLone ofthedefense‘s
largest problems was to prove that
the murder of Milk was not
premeditated. This wasahartl task
because Dan While both reloaded
his gun and went to seek Milk out.
(Milk was in his own office at the
lime,) The movie which GCEH
showed has a tape of White’s
confession which makes this clear
as well as several news clips that
also mention this fact. I suggest
that. Zoeckler gets the facts before
spouting inaccurate information.
