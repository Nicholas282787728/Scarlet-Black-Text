it is probably 111 order to
give some idea of the type of

against Beloit since many par-

to learn a little more about

Before the scason began, Grin
nell was rated by Midwest Con—
fcrcncc otricials as a team e117
pccted to accomplish little.
Graduation losscs permitted only
11 lcttcrmon to return to bolster
Grinnell’s hopes, and several of

these were not regula1s last sea 1

dlctcd to ﬁcld out a team cach

Grinnell achieved a minor

Against Carleton, however,
the Pioneers were not to be

Many surprisc factors cnlcrr
ed 111to Grinnell‘s victory lastl
Saturday, factors which promise

For one tl11ng, a sophomore who
played only 1111c. positions in

comc forward to lead Grilmcll's
rushmg gamc at halfback,

For another, the expert ﬁeld

be the defensive mainstay for;

Iin performances above we'-

”surprise" players, coupled
with ﬁne pertormanccs by
last year's lettermen, permitted
Grinnell to ﬁeld a stronger
