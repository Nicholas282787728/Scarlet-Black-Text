Swimmers can't be beaten this day

Midwest Conference coaches, the
meet was seen as a lOSSvup
between the Pioneers and the
Foresters
Coach Sheila Cain believes
Kthat the meet will be close for
several reasons. Pritnarily, the
ttwo schools' relay teams are very
A even. Cain also thinks that there
are events where Lake Forest is
>stronger than Grinnell, but that
)things will even up in events
’whcre Grinnell has the edge.
‘This trading off should keep the
‘meet close.

Strategy will play a
tremendous part in the meet
because the linerups are set day
by day. This should lead to

“guessing games between the
coaches in every event.
Cain feels that the team is
‘ both ready and excited to defend
its conference crown. The several
swimmers who are still dealing
with injuries are almost at 100
percent and are ready to go, Cain

is looking for big performances
from Furnish, Danforth, Deb
Kort, Allyson Jepscn. Susie
Petheram, Heather Lauver, and
Shannon Swanerom. Furnish
was last year's 50 free winner,
while Ken is the defending
champion in both the 100» and
ZOO-yard breaststroke,

The coach expects the meet
will come down to “whoever
swims betterl" She also believes
that depth will play a key role as
well. If the Pioneers can get as
many people as possible into the
finals of each event to pick up
places, she said, they should be
in good shape.

“I told everybody to swim
each prelim like it was a final so
we can qualify as many people as
possible," said Cain. She
continued, “They know every
swim will have to be strong
because, after winning last year‘s
meet by two points, they know
every person counts."

by Bruce Nissen .

On the heels of its firs
tournament title in Oskaloosa,
the Grinnell men‘s volleyball
club (self-dubbed the "Grinnell
Experience") returned home on
Sunday to host a match with
Drake. The Drake team arrived
determined to avenge its loss to
Grinnell in the Drake
Invitational, but received no such
satisfaction.

In the first game of the best-
of—five match. Grinnell clearly
established that they had gained
significant confidence since the
two teams‘ last meeting.
Grinnell cruised to a convincing
15-4 Victory, spearheaded by the
consistent setting of Roger
Coleman and the spiking of Ion
Pinter.

Poor execution cost the
“Experience" the second game.
Rallicd by the enthusiastic crowd,
Grinncll stormed back, sweeping
the next two gatnes (15-9, 1571 l)

. By winning the match.
Grinnell gained the respect of at
least one major school in Iowa.
“Drake is one of the two best
college club volleyball teams in
Iowa,” said the referee, Steve
Hess, who plays for the Uni-
versity of Iowa club team (which
lie humbly considered the other
team which deserved recognition).
Team ofﬁcials are busily at work
trying to schedule a match with
the Big Ten mogul.

Following the Drake match,
the Experience also scrimmaged
the Maharishi International
University team. Although
marred by sluggish play, Grinnell
emerged victorious, three games
to one. Grinnell‘s lone bright
spot was the play of sophomore
Alex Motsehiner.

The team’s ltext toumatnent
will be March 4 in Des Moincs.

Buddha
drowns
foes

by Laura WhiLmorc

Grinnell hosted the Buddha
Invitational last Saturday and it
was downright embarrassing, for
the other teams. that is. Grinnell
scored 717 potnts to Knox, Coe,
and Cornell‘s combined score of
440. Needless to say, a myriad
of Grinnellians did real well in
many events.

In the first event of the day,
the 1650 free, Pioneers' Peyton
Engel. Martin Moon, and Joe
Lewis captured the top three
spots. This was the start of a
trend. In fact, wlten the waves
had finally subsided, Grinnell had
captured at least the top two
spots of every tat/c.

The 400medley relay team of
Clem, Nelson. Sandeen, and
Murrin placed first, with the team
of Martin, Bushnaq, Patrick, and
Smith coming in second. In the
ADO-free relay Clem, Nelson,
Moon, and Smith edged out the
team of Williams, Potts,

' Hornbncher, and Martin for first

place.

In the 200 free, Paul Frocsc
managed to come in first. even
with a pressing presidential
campaign on his mind. Moon
and Steve Hornbachcr placed
second and third respectively. Joe
Zimsen won the 200 IM, with
Steve Clem placing second.
Zimsen also captured first in the
100 breaststroke. ’

John Williams had a good
outing, winning both the 50 and
100 free, with Kevin Doerschug
taking second in both races
Dave Rcssner was back after
missing last week‘s meet due to
illness, and captured the 400 IM,
a nasty event if I've ever seen
one.

In diving, Grinnell was

‘ unparalleled, In 3M diving, Phil

Bishop once again won, with
strong performances from
teatnmates Rob Aulwcs and Joel
Shapiro. In one-meter diving,
Bishop, Aulwes. Shapiro, and
Jim McGovern captured the top
four spots respectively. Bishop‘s
score of 30090 set a new school

and pool record and qualified him
for Division-l nationals
(provided, of course that he places
first at the Divisiunrlll ntte
tionttls).

Obviously Coach Obermtllcr
was pleased, and he described the
performances as “darned good.“

time of the season. The Pioneers
