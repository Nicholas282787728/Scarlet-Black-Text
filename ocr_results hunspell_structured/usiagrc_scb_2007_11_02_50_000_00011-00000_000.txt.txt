While many Grlnncll College students were enjoying
their break at home, on vacation or in an AltBrcak program, a
number ofstudent athletic teams stayed here, slumming in the
dorms so that they could finish out their seasons, For those of

the Pioneer women's volleyball team was looking for ways to

The Pioneer volleyball team found some
spark to finish the season, ending its 2007
campaign by splitting four marches over
the break. After dropping non-conference
marches to Mt. Mei-cy (1-3) and Cornell (o-

Unsurprisingly, Saturday
brought another Pioneer cross
country title for both the men,
their 11th straight, and the
women, their fourth straight.

This consistent domination
of the Midwest Conference
begs the question: is it gets
ting boring yet?

For men’s cross country
head coach Will Freeman, it
might be, since he still wasn’t

totally pleased with the team’s
performance.

“They did not run as well
as they could," he said. Freer
man must have been hoping
for a more decisive victory, as
the Pioneers only eked out

second place st. Norbert by
six points. Hive Pioneer rune
ners finished seventh through
11th, a pack mentality ap,
proach that emphasizes the
team over the individual per
formance.

it’s a shame, really, because I love some of the Boston sports
stars. I grew up watching KC and Randy Moss, and would
like nothing better than for them to win a title. I only say this
because the Vikings and T’Wolves are in an epic struggle to see
who can better impersonate the Cleveland Spiders. But now
that the Red Sox have emerged victorious in what might have
been the worst playoffs in history (there were three highlights:
the Rockies, the ALCS going seven games and free taco day),
nothing would be more horriﬁc than a potential Red Sex-Pats-
Celtics trifecta.

Even places fans go to avoid ESPN hype find that they're
helpless to the power or the prerBoston, antirBoston divide.
Deadspin’s commenter threads, a slowly deteriorating bastion
of funny refs
erences, rrr
r e v e r e n e c
and dick
jokes, have
become un-
readable in
past weeks, as cracks about bosron’s success are followed by
unfunny reactionary comments by So fans. “Why can't we
just appreciate their success?" they cry. Right. screw them.
My teams can't ever win, so I could care less about three of
your teams (four if you Count Boston college football) being
in contention.

The thing is, l have no problem with the actual teams being
good. If only Minnesota sports were as good. However, when
success is coupled with annoying sports “personalities," millions
of bandwagoners, pink bats, Dane Cook and Boston fans in
general, it’s intolerable. it's no wonder fans nationwide are putt
ting a bounty on Tom Brady's head (and knee); where is Albert
Haynesworth when you really need him?

I won’t advocate going that far, though. I would be deeply
saddened if Brady went down to injury, inevitably ending the
run of the greatesr football team of alletime. At the halfway
point ofthe season, the Patriots have dominated like no other,
scoring at least 34 points in every game and putting the all time
p , reams—rhc ’85 Bears, the ’72 Dolphins, the Wellsl‘rem
49 s——to shame with their blowout victories.

Brady is on pace to shatter Manning‘s iecoid for passing
touchdowns, Moss looks lrltc he'll make a run at Rice‘s record
for KL’CC‘lVil‘g touchdown and the Patriots offense as a whole is
likely going to oblitci- t iltC rccoirl for most points scored in
a season. The Putt-lots are on pace for a staggering ooz, which
would bieak the record (ago by the 1998 Minnesota Vikings)
by over loo points, For rcnce, the dificieiice would be ap-
pmxlmntel) the same as the spread between last year’s Colts
(super Bowl Champions) and last years Arizona Cardinals (5-
11).

With the right run of luck, though. we could be out of this
mess sooner than you think.

Given the putridity' ofthe baseball playoffs, ESPN has al-
ready moved on from the Boston scene thanks to the only things
more obno - us than the Sox. the Yankees managing shakeup
and the wairing game to see who will fork over Micronesia's
GDP ($277 million, ifyou're interested) for Alex Rodriguez.

It shouldn't take much for the media attention to die down
for Boston's third hype machine, the Celtics. The team is only
fourrdccp, and as soon as Ray Allen and Paul Pierce follow up
last year's ankle and knee injuries by getting hurt again, the
team will look suspiciously like last years Twolves.

And maybe, somehow, someway, the colts will upend the
Patriots. Sure, then they would be hyped beyond belief, but at
least theyvare from a different geographical area.

Which brings me to somethingl find quite concerning, I
don't live in New England,i know maybe three Boston fans, yet
I have an extreme dislike for the fan base. And I don‘t know
what else to blame besides the mundatiou of ESPN and its
subordinates regarding Boston sports. 1 don't care abour Jona-
than Papelbon’s dorky celebratory Riverdancc and it pains me
to see KG in a shamrock #5, but what can I do? Shut myself
offt'rom sports?
