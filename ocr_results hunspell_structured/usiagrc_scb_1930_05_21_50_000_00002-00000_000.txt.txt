COLLEGIATE ADVERTISING

It has been generally held that a. winning football
team is the best advertisement for a college, but Syrac-
use university has had‘occasion to disprove that. The
school demonstrated that the intellectual side of a col«
lege is just as attractive to the general public.

An educational exposition was held on the campus,
and the only thrill that the university offered its visit—
ors was that of seeing a college “in action.” Thirty-five
thousand persons from all parts of New York state res
sponded to the invitation. Tho Syracuse-Colgate foot-
ball game draws less than that number.

Perhaps Grinncll could throw the campus open to
visitors during speciﬁed onys next year. The routine
of the regular daily schedule would not be interrupted,
because that is the chief object of the exposition—to see
the campus as it is every day of the year. The classes
could be open, and special lectures would not he amiss.
The dormitories could be exhibited in much the same
way they were to the recent high school visitors.

Such an exposition undoubtedly would give the vis<
itors a, more concrete interest in Grinnell, and an en-
tirely new slant on the college, compared with the im-
pression derived from an afternoon visit to an athletic
competition. Of course visitors are welcome at all times
on the campus. but a special invitation would probably
attract many who would otherwise stay away. And
the town people would undoubtedly cooperate with en»
thusiasm.

If such an exhibition should prove too great a dif-
ficulty, perhaps visitors could be invited to special lec-
tures by certain members of the faculty, delivered in the
afternoon, and advertised throughout the state. Guests
coming to these would carry away an impression almost
as true of the college as that given through a thorough
visit, such as would be possible at an exposition.

Syracuse has shown that collegiate liie is as attrac-
tive to the public as collegiate athletics. Grinncll should
take advantage of the tact and advertise its campus life
on its own merits. H, L. 5.

THE GRINNELL LIBERAL CLUB.

Whether or not the Liberal club at Grinnell college.
much attacked and defended since its prohibition poll
of the school, is a "green student club seeking to get
its name in the papers" as the alumni organ now claims,
this much can be said for it. It was a voluntary organ-
ization of undergraduates proposing to acquaint them—
selves with national and world problems that the over-
age college student is not credited with worrying much
about. And in that degree it certainly justiﬁes encour-
agement.

The claim is too often made that today's student
bodies are more interested in social activities than
study, more interested in credits than any thorough
comprehension of the subjects. That claim is of course
only partly founded, and yet it is reassuring when a
sizeahle group organizes itself to look beyond the sup-
erﬁcial aspects of college curriculums.

As far as the prohibition polls are concerned, every-
one knows that in popular ussge “dry" and ”wet" mean
for and against the prohibition amendment, and that
as yet there has certainly been no evidence that a maj-
ority of the "wets" could be united behind one plan that
would endanger that amendment.

But beyond all that, ther; is no peril in investiglv
tions that reveal facts or varied points of view. To get
young people (or old people) to thinlr is a. commendable
project anytime or anywhere. and it they are encourag-
ed to think out our modern problems thoroughly, Lhe na-
tion is going to be better because of it.4The Des Moines
