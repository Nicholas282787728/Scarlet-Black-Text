THE HOUSE-PARTY DILEMMA

Now is the tilne to act to avoid financial chaos
in building treasul'ics this year. The house-party,
a social event featured twice a year on allnost
every house calendar, looms bcforc each hall and
cottage as a possible stumbling block to a success
ful year. The administration of ezleh hall has been
forced to condone a stringent economy program,
but nobody scelns willing to relinquish the pleas-
ure of a houscrparty. Hardly a building can afford
tllc cost of this affair, but elaborate plans for it
are under way as in past years.

Tllc expense of a house-party tends to throw
the house budget into a dilemma, which will nca
cessitate elimination of other events on the housc
calendar. This is not fair to tllosc whose greatest
pleasure is not found in dancing. They are gladly
contributing their share to the support of the
house-party, knowing affairs for them probably
will be pro ded for also. If these other usual af-
fairs are eliminated from the house program, thesc
men have been done an injustice and the adminis-
tration finds itself in “hot water” Sonic men want
house-parties; othcrs rallk smolicls first on the
housc program. Both have to be appeascd and this
is where thc house government faces a dilemma.

It has been suggested that a collsolidation of
three houses for one house party will rcducc tllc
expense to each building sufficiently to allow
smokers and other social affairs in the buildings.
Three houses will find alnplc dancing spat-c ill
Rand gymnasium. Decorating will be easier and an
elaborate party will be possible. This appears the
most plausible solution to the house-party dilemma
and is as applicable to the women as to the lncn.
Such a plan must be put illto effect at once before
any one house has progrcsscd too far with its plans
for a party.

ACCURACY

Possibly no American institution exccpt tllc
government itself is the butt of so much outspoken
criticism as are the newspapers of the country.
When men are pleased, they say little; when they
are displeased they shout it to the skies. It is
human nature. th much of the cr icisln of news
papers is ignorant and. biased—resulting from lack
of knowledge of thc functio of a newspaper.

Skipping lnuch of the c ticism by cranks and
zealots who interpret the duties of a ncwspapcr as
including everything from prophesying the second
coming of Christ to announcing without ally cvir
deuce whatsoever, that the president of thc bank
is a crook and a scoundrcl, the largestmriticism
is that of inaccuracy, and to some extent it is
justified, Despitc the efforts which good news-
papers make to safeguard against inaccurate state-
ments, the element of human error crccps now and
then into the news columns. Lee A. White of the
Detroit News declares that, on tllc average, one
error is committed to every 3,250 elements of
chalice on a daily newspaper. Thc possibilities for
error are set forth by Ralph Rulitzcr, former pub-
lisher of the now defunct New York World, who
states that on the VJorld, “166,000 words written
by 2,000 contributors, reporters and correspondents
were read and handled in six hours by copyeread-
ers; cast in type at the rate of 16 words a minute,
and printed at the speed of 120,000 papers an
hour. "

Because of the necessity for speed, the depend-
ence of reporters on news sources. and the de-
pendence of editors upon correspondents allover
the world, the elements of chance arc lnany. Con-

sidering this element of chance, the astounding

thing about journalism of today is that so fcw

errors do creep into tllc ncws pagcs. “Accuracy.

accuracy, accuracy!“ is the slogan, religion, and
' led into newspaper men.

‘11 academic positions are among tllc

es of newspaper accuracy. Some go

so far as to scorn American newspapers altogether

with tllc possible exception. of the New York

Times and Christian Scicncc Imlitol', which ap-
pcnl because of their conservatism.

Yet. with no attempt to excuse newspapers bc-
(‘auso of the, spccd necessary to produce cach odi-
tion, we believe that r a class, nclrspopcrmcn are

GOOD LUCK, SWIMNERS

Following agitation by the student council last
spring for a fund from which expenses for a l‘ﬂl‘s-
ity swimming tcanl alld schedule would be main-
tained, and the subscqucnt cstablishmcnt of thc
fund, a determined group of students began re-
cently to work out in tllc pool with the idea of do
velopillg a varsity team in spite of the absence of
a salaried coach. .

Coach Elton Roscn last year dcvcloped an un-
defeated team which ploughed thru opponents on
a stiff schcdulc. Nothing like that can be expected
th' ye r, but the spirit in which aspirants arc
pl'act illg, training and angling for a few Varsity
contests is the true spirit of colnpctitivc sport.

NIETZSCHE AND HITLER

On October I5, 1844, a genius was born in
Germany who was to hurl a flaunting cllallcngc to
Christianity. His name .u‘ﬂs Friedrich Nietzsche.

Although himself an invalid for a great part
of his lifc, Nietzsche formed a strange philosophy
of life. He declared that Christianity was a dccar
dcnt religion, in which the weak, tllc defective,
and the defeated imposed, through tllc strcngth of
their numbcrs, tllcir pcrvcrsc morality upon the
strong. the healthy, and tllc courageous.

While it would be a great injustice to Iictzr
sche to compare llilu to Hitler, there is neverthe-
less a striking similarity in tllc unscientific and
mad t inking of the two men:

r\‘ tysche bcliel'cd that Germany had no true
culture because its arts and sciences came from
foreigners and not from true Germans. Ill Hitler
today we see tllc some ridiculous thinking in tllc
lattcr’s llnllscnsical talk about the “pure Aryan”.

Socialists, radicals, and other “discontcnts”
wcrc despicable to Nietzsche because they repre-
sented the defeated in life, who wished to’ ovcre
throw tllc strong and noble men who were ill
power. Hcrr Hitler believes tllc Nazi despotism
, ' cuts tllc rule of the noble, and, the pure in
spl t and blood. chce his bloodthirsty attack up-
ou the liberal elements who don't agree with lliln.

And to cap it all, from the soft seclusion of
his invalid chair, Nietzsche proclailncd that war
was something manly and invigorating, a natural
occurrence which cleansed and stimulated to high
endeavor a decaying and lethargic civilization.
Nietzsche’s heroes, his “superman”, wcrc Caesar.
Alexander the Great, and Napoleon. Hitler and
Nietzsche would have made good bctlfellows.

Ill 1900 Nietzsche died, hopelessly insane. His
philosophy, to be sure, was virile and provocative.
But it was more poetry and a fanciful flight of a
genius, than a broad, calm, and rational outlook
upon life.

AGAIN—

For tllc last time—«we hopeathc public address
systcm at home football games is a topic in the
editorial colulnns. The announcer for the past two
games was not paid for his services by the manager
mom of the address system. but was prevailed up-
on to do the work against his will. He makes no
pretense of being familiar with the identities of
Grlnnell players as they appear in football uni-
forms, and has no desire to continue as announcer.

. It is up to the managers of the system to pro»
vlde an announccr familiar with players, plays,
alld football rules—and not to hold a contest for
announcers who will do the work for nothing and
thus have no incentive for spending time in pre-
paring for games. If thc right methods are used—
Thc Scarlct and Black heartily cndorscs the public
address system.
