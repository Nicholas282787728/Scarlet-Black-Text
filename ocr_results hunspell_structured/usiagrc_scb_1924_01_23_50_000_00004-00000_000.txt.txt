Williams is as much better to shave with as the Hinge-
Cap is better than other caps: The lather is heavier and
holds the moisture in againsiyour beard. Quickersohening
results. Also, Viilliams lather lubricales the skin. There
is noticeable absence ofirritaung razor friction. And
Williams takes good care of the skin. Though you shave
daily, your face remains smooth and feels comfortable.
Williams is a pure, natural-white Cream absolutelywith-
out coloring matter. Try it!
