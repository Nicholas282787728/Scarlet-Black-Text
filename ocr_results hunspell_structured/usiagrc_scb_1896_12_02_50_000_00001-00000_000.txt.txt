The Western Football
pionship.

By Chicago’s defeat of Michi-
gan and Northwestern's tie game
with Wisconsin. the question of
the western championship iseadiy
muddled. On the strength of the
maroori’s victory in the Coliseum.
Director Stagg arbitrarily claims
that the pennant should float
above Chicago's hails. although
his claims are lrztlgl’lﬁd at by those
who remember that Wisconsin
ran away with his pets to the
tune of 24-0, while the purple
stockinged giants from North-
western strewed the individuals
of the maroon team allover Mare
shall Field while they ran the
score up to 456. Ignoring this
game Stagg takes into account
only the return game in which
Northwestern was defeated 18 6.
and he seeks to offset Wiscon '
victory by the tie game which
Northwestern played tltem, after
being defeated in this second
game. ThevictoryoverMichigan
is in his opinion sufﬁcient to juse
tity Chicago's claims.

Wisconsin seems in the minds
of many competent jtidgesto have
the lead. They have gone through
the season without defeat. having
been tied at Evanston, and played
a game with Belolt. which the lat-
ter, on questionable grounds,
claims was a tie game The Math
isoniaiis atlminis ‘rcd a decisive
defeat to Minnesota hard
fought game. making a tlecidcrily
better showing against them than
did Michigan.

Grinnell Again the Victor.

For three years the teams rep-
rescnting Grinliell College anti
the Y M. C A of Des Moines
have met on Thanksgiving Day to
decide their superiority on the
gridiron, The ﬁrst game went to
the v. M c, A, team by the close
score, 6—4 The last two years
Grinnell has non this annual game,
but each time only alter a hard
ioiight' battle. Drsagreeable
weather of some sort has always
been experienced for that game,
but never in previous years has it
fallen to the lot of the two teams
to do battle on s'uch a ﬁeld as that
of last Thursday, Rain had fal-
len steadily ior several hours and
the ﬁeld was one vast mudpuddle.
Lines could not be distinguished
and the progress of the ball could
only be measured by the distance
between ant/Iowa,

The condition of the ﬁeld did
not allow of a sensational game.
End runs were out of the question
so the spectators were treated to
an exhibition of straight hard litre
bucking in this Grinnell evir
dently was superior, although her
supporters before tire game feared
the opposite would be true other
light team.

Grinnell scored her ﬁrst and the
only touchdown of the game
eight minutes after the ﬁrst kick-
off. They rushed the ball right
down the ﬁeld, only waiting long
enough between signals for the
players to clean the mud from
their eyes and ears.
to those on the sidelines that she
was going to have an easy timc of
it and win by a large score. but
shortly after the second kick-off
the Des Moines team braced up
and from then on to the close of
the game it was as pretty a con-
test as one would care to see. Se-
curing the ball on downs, they im-
mediately began a series of line
bucks which landed the ball on
Grinnell‘s five yard lin Here,
however, they stopped short.
Grinnell's line heltl like a stone
hall and the ball went to them on
downs and was immediately punt-
ed out oi dangerous ground, Tins
was the neawst the Y. M. C. A.
tedm came to scoring and the
hearts of their rooteis were heavy
as this chance was lost.

Scrubs' Hard-Earned Victory.

While the ‘Varsity was battling
against the Y M C. A. football
team, and incidentally the ele-
merits also at Des Monies Thanks
giving Day. the second team was
playing one of the hardest fought
games played in the state this
year. The groundswercslippery.
Great pools of water stood in the
north end of the hold and the rain
fell almost tiirremittingly during
the last half.

B . er the fact that the grounds
were so slippery that end runs
were hard to make. the second
team had to defeat a team that
averaged over twelve pnunds to
the man heavier than they did.
Every yard gained .iias earned
and earned, too, by the hardest
kind of hard football.

The interierettce of the Grinrrcll
team stai'tt‘d quickly for the most
part and the backsiollowed it well.

Very early in the game Captain

substantial gains through his ope

rely almost entirely on end runs
