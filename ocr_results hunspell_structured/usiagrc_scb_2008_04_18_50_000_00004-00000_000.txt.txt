Students ad
responsible

BY MATT ZMUDKA

In 1977, Grinnell students took part in the
national campaign calling for colleges to divest
their investments from apartheid south Attica,
a campaign that culminated with Grinnell's di-
vestment in 1988. Three decades later another
gioup of students sees themselves as the heirs
of the iuitirdpiutheid movement and are push-
ing for the college to engage in “socially respon-
sible" investing piactices

Linn Davis ‘08, the coordinator and co-
foundcr of Students for Responsible Investing
(SR1), sees the college “takmg the financial re-
sponsibilities more important than the moml
responsibility at times.

This May, when mem—
bers of the Board ofTiust~
ees return to campus, SR1
will present them with a
proposal to encourage to use
its power as a shareholder in!
corporations to vote in favor
of what students see as see
cially responsible practices
like capping greenhouse gas emissions, a stratr
egy known as “proxy Voting."

According to SR1 members, the proxy vote
ing approach is both more practical and eltee
tive than demanding complete divestment from
companies seen as morally questionable,“[Pro>ry
voting] would in no way affect the college’s nbllr
ity to invest in different companies and there’s
not a danger of revealing the college's secrets
about where they are investingfsaid SRl meme
bet Leah Krandel '09,

Trustee and member ofthe Investing Come
mirtee Clint Korver '89. a Silicon Valley entree
preneur, agreed, saying that because proxy VOP
ing deals with matters of corporate governance
and not hot-button ethics issues, “it's rare for
proxy voting to be controversial."

one aspect that members of SRI empha-
sized is educating the campus about investing
in general.“People didn't really understand what
was going on [initially] That’s the problem
with this, it gets technical really quickly," Davis
said.

“A lot of people don’t understand how these
proxy votes work,” Krandel agreed. “If all that
happens is we educate 1,500 students on some»
thing they can call upon later, it’s still important
work"

The group’s initial proposal, put forth in
spring 2006, included five points: a statement
of responsible investing, increased tmnsparency,
a committee on responsible investing, proxy

jcctcd is that “

{ogandav@grinneii.edu; anis/eld@grinnellledu

vocate for
investing

voting, and community involvement. The cenr
terpiece ofthis proposal was to he the commits
tee,which would consist oi‘srndents, faculty and
tnistecs that would have knowledge of Grin-
nell's investments and make recommendations
for voting or even divestment.

Sin the initial piesentation, only the state-
ment has been formally dppioied bv the trust-
ces; SR1 received a lettel stating that the other
recommendations \veie inadvisable

Davis aid he believed that one of the lC‘il’
sons their pro rosals have been continually [er

Eadministmtors] feel it’s unnecesr
sary,t that they choose investment maiiageis that
are already socially responsible' and likewise

dont want to take ilvlmy res
sponsibilitics granted to the
investment managers.
Korver said he gave “two
thumbs up for student inir
tintivc" and denied that the
Investing Committee had
ever rejected an SR1 pier
posal. He said that a state-
ment on responsible investing, which is part
of the SR1 proposal, “is now an official part of
[college] policy." His view of responsible investr
ing rnvolved making lon erm investments in
secure companies and hiring qualiry portfolio
managers.

After the Trustees decided not to adopt
SRl's proposal in 2006, as well as an amended
proposal dealing with only creation of a come
mince in fall 2007, SM has focused its work on
encouraging proay voting on several resolutions
at ConocoPhillips which the group will focus
on this May.

Another presentation that will appear be-
fore the tnistees will demonstrate the results of
a MAP by SGA President Megan Goering '08,
which examined SR1 movements across the na»
rion. She said her conclusions will “try to figaue
out how to utilize [SR1] tools to advance their
missions and not detract from them "

Despite some obstacles, SR1 advocates said
they were excited about the progress that has
been made. “The progress that they've already
made in incorporating a statement ofsocial te-
sponsibill'ty into the school’s investment policy
has been incredible,” Goeting said.

Korver was very enthused about SRI‘s in-
volvement in investment issues and looked
forward to an “ongoing conversation. If they
feel strongly about something, the Investment
Committee is all ears.”

 

Finkelstein

from p. 1 In order to secure

funding for the event,
members of P36 approached, among others,
the Peace Studies Program, bur Pence stud-
ies declined to provide funding. val Vetter, the
coordinator of the Peace Studies Program, said
they declined to fund the event because they
were not completely aware ottinkelstein and
his views, "Peace Studies would like to know
more about the person who‘s presenting and
have the time for a balanced discussion," Vet-
ter said.
But accordin to Ashe ” '
ley Ross ‘08, a rriember of The war/dis full ﬂip
the Peace Studies Program,

the Finkelstein lecture was

largely because he was con-

sidered too contentious. “It

was decided that Finkclstein was too controver-
sial oia figure and the request was denied before
itwas even brought before the entire committee
for a vote,"she said.“Although Peace Studies is
pressed for funding toumrds the end of the year,
that was not the reason why the request was
denied." In the recent past, Peace Studies has
sponsored other scholars, such as James zogby,
who have addressed like topics.

Ashley Ross’08

Ross said she thinks its good for the campus
to bring contentious people to campus and that
while the views of a scholar might be “extreme”
they promote dialogue in response.

“In the end it is beneﬁcial to the community
because it brings attention to issues and raises
discussion that people otherwise won’t have,"
she said. “The world is full ofpcople who dist
agree with you.Thcy aren't going to brainivash
us.

However, despite tear of campus polarizas
tion and Finkelstein’s contro-
versial scholarship, his visit to
Grinncll has not seemed to
have caused noticeable waves
among students. “Maybe
there’s an openness and a cu-
riosity about it," said Vetter.
“Maybe students aren’t aumre
ofthc controversy that has surrounded him."

Heller will be corleading Chilliimni next
semester and hopes that in the futuie Chnlutr
zim and PSG will have an active dialogue. She
said, “Maybe next time they can say, ‘Hey, were
bringing this gry; what do you think?"

Bats

from p. 1
The three students

said that the vaccination process has been com
plicated and that they each

received a total of nine shots

through multiple visits to the

Grinnell Regional Hospital

"che been to the hospital

three times and we have to

go back two more rimcs,"said

Dagenais,

In addition to the incon-
venience associated with the
medical visits, the students
are wonicd that their insur-
ance will not cover the cost and that they will
have to pay for the vaccination.They said that
the school was at least partly responsible and
should help pay for the vaccines.

“Vaccines are really expensive and ifinsur
ance does not cover it, Grinncll should, bcr
cause they set the bat free without testing it,"
said Dagenais.

Stephen Briscoc. director of Security, said
that Security responds to problems with bits

in the dorms on a regular basis, “It goes on
throughout the year,"Briscoe said.“It happens
just about every week,”

Because of the frequent
problems with bars, security has
developed a standard procedure
in dealing with them. When
responding to a call of bats in
the dorms, security officers
carry nets and gloves to catch
the bats, after which the officers
release the bats from the dorms,
“We usually take them outside
and release them. We call the
vets sometimes," said Briscoe.

Briscoe said that the incident has led to
a new policy on bats. “If students have been
sleeping in a room where there’s been a bat our
procedure is [now] to catch the bat and take
the bat to one of the veterinarian clinics," said
Briscoe.

“[They can] get the bat checked out for
precautionary reason because we know bats
carry diseases sometimes."
