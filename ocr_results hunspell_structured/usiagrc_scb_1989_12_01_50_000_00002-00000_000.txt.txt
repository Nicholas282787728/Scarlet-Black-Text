Thefts Put New Spin on Doing Laundry

 

By Jennifer Watson

The unsuspectingGrinnell student
brings her laundry down to the Loose
Hail laundry room witlt three weeks
worth of dirty clothesinearly every
item of clothing she owns. Two hours
later she returns from dinner to take
her clothes out of the dryer only to
find the machines emptyt Thinking
that some rude individual has
dumped her clothes in a comer. she
frantically searches the room but
can'tfind herclothes anywhere. She
is struck by the awful truth: all her
clothes have been stolen.

Although most studentsdon'thave
several loads of laundry Stolen at
once, laundry thefts at Grinnell are
not uncommon. Posters begging for
the return of a favorite item of cloth-
ing appear in all campus laundry
rooms. Butthereis little students can
do to prevent thefts and even less
they can do to get clothing returned.

The latest twist in laundry thefts
involves a bizarre modus operandi:
the thief steals clothes from washing
machines and redistributes them in
dorm freezers around campus, ru-
mor has it.

AnneNelson hada Grinnell sweat-
shirt and a rugby jersey stolen from
the Loose Hall laundry room during
parents weekend, Nelson said she
had not left her laundry unattended
for a long period of time. She does
not know who the thiefis and neither
item has been returned

HeatherRychener left her laundry
unattended in the Main Hall facility
for two or three hours on Oct 8,
When she came back several items
had been taken from her dryer. Sev-
eral days later, everydling but her
Grinnell sweatshirt had been re
turned. “1 was lucky," says Rych-

ener, who holdslittle hope of getting
her sweatshirt returned.

Students have very few options
when they attempt to retrieve stolen
clothing. Clothing sold by the col-
lege seems to be stolen more fre-
quently because, as Nelson pointed
out, many students have identical
items and they can‘t be identiﬁed as

stolen when the thief wears them
Many students hang posters in laun-
dry rooms and some offer rewards
for the return of their clothing. Stu»
dents can also report thefts to the
office of student affairs Assistant
dean of student affairs Oda Callison
said the office receives only a couple
of complaints each year~and none
so far this year.

Callison also said that students
can do little to prevent thefts. ”The
best way to prevent it is to stay with
your clemes,” she stated.

“That’s what you do at Commer-
cial laundries where you don’t [mist
the people around you I’d take a
book and stay in the laundry room,"
Callison said.

DRUG INITIATIVE

that it would fail, I think that the stu
dent body perhaps is a little short-
sighted in terms ofdrugs’ effects on
other people," Kcntsaid. “I think the
student body is only really thinking
about how drug use is affecting the
individual using the drugs."

Few students seemed surprised that
the initiative failed Rather, they
seemed more surprised at how much
support it actually garnered.

“in a weird way, I sort of expected
it," said sophomore Adam Miller of
the failure of the initiative. “I knew
it would be the closest initiative on
campus yet,”

Many students railed against the
very idea of the referendum i that
through.a vote Grinnell‘s student
body would speak in a single voice.
Issues such as drug use, they said,

WOMEN’S ALLIANCE

 

Continued from p. 1

the alliance.

“I think we have been discrimiv
nated against," Mortcnson said.

BcrkowitzVGross said that al»
though some changes in staffing
policy may be necessary, those
changes would probably take time.

“The afﬁrmative action question
has not been applied as much as it
could be to all levels of employ-

ment," she said

Several members said the alliance
was important as a recently estab
lished voice for women. as a collecr
tive body, to influence decision-
making

“This is an exceptional opportu-
nity for the Grinnell College com-
munity as a whole to benefit from
this commuee," saidlamcs Lincoln,
director of ﬁnancial aid and a mem—
ber of the alliance.

were too complex or personal to be
reduced to a yes or no question on a
ballot.

“It was a ridiculous thing for
S.G.A. to try and pass. It should be
an individual choice," said Chris
Lowery.

“I don't like the idea of voting on
one opinion for a campus to have,
especially here," said freshman
Michael Kavanagh. “I think
everyone's entitled to their own
opinion.”

Senior Todd Brown said he voted
against the initiative even though he
agrees on the harmful effects of
drugs,

“I don‘t disagree with the state-
ments made about illegal drugs i
thatthey're harmfulto yourhealthor
well-being. But it rings of fascistic
social control," Brown said.

Other reasons for voting against
theinitiativeincludeddisagreements
over the goal of the “war on drugs.”

“Whatthey focus on,illegal drugs
# they're not the problem," said
senior Tn'ni Campbell. “There’s a
bigger epidemic with alcohol and
tobacco use"

“The war on drugs, which this
initiative reeks of, is not looking at
why people use drugs in the ﬁrst
place,“ Todd Brown said, “They’re
tryingtosquelchthc symptoms while
they‘re not looking at the cause.

“It‘s a futile attempt, like trying to
prevent women from having abor-
tions. They can‘t win," he said.
