ELSEWH R 1N these columns
will be found noticeot a meetingol
the Oratorical Association which
is to beheld next Monday at l p,
in. Meetings have been called at
two different times the past week
but on each occasion important
action has been postponed on ac-
count ot thesmall number present.
We might add that the ladies so-
eieties were not represented at all.
The business to come before the
Association is very impoitant and
of such a nature that it should be
decided only by a representativel
portion of the sludent body. All
members at the college moieties
are members of the Association
and there is no reason why the at
tcndancc at the meeting next
Monday should not be large,

AT A meeting of the Athletic
Union, last Wednesday afternoon,
a move toward some very radical
changes in athletic control and
management was made. A reso-
lution was passed to the effect that
it is the desire of the Athletic
Union that the alumni submit a
plan of control which they deem
to be better than our present sys-
tem; this plan to be acted upon by
the Athletic Union, The resolu-
tion is merely a preliminary step
and the union is not bound there-
by to accept the proposed plan.
This meets with the hearty ap-
proval of SCARLET AND BLACK. In
the ﬁrst place, it is a movement in
line with what other institutions
have been and are doing. At Iowa
City they have a board on which
are several prominent alumni,
which has direct charge of the ath-
letics, At Michigan the plan oi
graduate manager has been in ct-
fect and is a success. The same
may be said ot Wisconsin and 0th
er prominent institutions. FLU"
thermore, our own system lacks
unity. The managers of the vari-
ous teams act independent ot each
other and make schedules and
estimates of seasons without re-
gard tor the other teams. To say
the least, this is an unbllsmesslils‘c
way of handling our athletics and
it is this defect and otheisthat the
alumni committee intend to |Enler
dy by the plan they will propose.
The scheme which will be submit-
ted has not been fully formulated
as yet, so we can make no deﬁnite
statement as to its details. Howe
ever, we can assure the alumni
committee that their efforts in this
line are appreciated and that the
student body is iully in sympathy

 

with the movement.
