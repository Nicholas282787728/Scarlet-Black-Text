Lettuce referendum passes

Last Wednesday night, SGA
passed a proposal presented by an
ad hoc Committee to hold a Student
referendum relating to the
question oi whether the College
Food Service should boycott all
non-UFw lettuce and grapes. The
committee is composed of Jon
Neiderbach, Wayne Passmore and
Andy McKibben.

This question was revised from
an earlier one which stated.
”Should only UFW lettuce and
grapes be served by the college
iood service, expecting that when
UFW products are unavailable,
non-boycotted romaine, bibb and
leaf lettuce be made available for
those students who wish to support
the boycott?”

The tollowing statement was
presented to the SGA by the ad hoc
Committee and describes the
rationale behind the committee's
proposal.

“The basic right to organize and
choose union representation was
granted to most American workers
by Congress over iorty years ago,
Early last year, after many years
of struggle, suiiering and violence,
the farm workers of California won
this cherished right. And organize
and vote they did; in 400 elections
involving 40,000 workersiabout 10
per cent at the total—more than
30,000 voted for their own union'
the United Farm Workers, AFL-
CIO. In the imperial Valley. the
state’s most fertile region, the

by Dave Wick

UFw won 23 of 26 elections. These
election resultsiand the tau and
just labor contracts they portendi
did not sit well with either
Agribusiness or the Westerr
Conierence of Teamsters. They
tried to halt the elections by lob-
hying against continued iunding oi
the Labor Relations Board; their
poweriul iniluence stymied a
majority or the Caliiornia
legislature so that the elections
have indeed been stopped.
“Thus, now more than ever
beiore, the Farm Workers need our
support. in order to pressure the
Agribusiness~Teamster interests
into supporting revival oi secret-

ballot elections, we at Grinnell
College must join a nationwide
movement by continuing last
year's boycott by the College Fol?
Service of non»UFW lettuce aii
grapes, Our action is needed; to
simply do nothing is in reality to
oppose the hundreds oi thousands
who have worked unceasingly to
guarantee that those who work in
America's fields are never again
deprived of their right to Vote.”
On Friday, November 6, the
referendum will be held in the Post
Office and both SGA and the ad hoc
committee urge everyone to voice
their opinion,
