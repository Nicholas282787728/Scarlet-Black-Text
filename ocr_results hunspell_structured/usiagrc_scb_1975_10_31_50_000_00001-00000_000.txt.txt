As the election year draws closer
many are paying close attention to

, the proceedings in lowa. Saturday,

“.scven Democratic candidates

spoke at the annual Jefferson-
Jackson Day Dinner in Ames, in an
effort to gain supporters who will
back them in Iowa‘s precinct
caucuses to be held January 19.
Taking a possible first step
towards getting involved in‘the
candidate selection, about 25
Grinnell students acted as ushers
at the dinner which was held in

‘ililton Coliseum on the lowa State

University campus.

Iowa’s caucus meetings are
important because the results of
“lose meetings will be the first
tangible indication ot voter support
anywhere in the nation. lowa holds
its meetings before any other state
and over a month before the first

.presidential primary in New

Hampshire on February 24.
Before the candidates spoke,
Sen. George McGovern (SD), the
'72 Democratic presidential
candidate, addressed an estimated
4,000 people as they finished licking
the Kentucky Fried Chicken off
their fingers. McGovern accepted
the blame for the failure of his 1972
campaign and urged this year’s
hopefuls not to let his defeat he “an

\excuse for an empty politics of none

issues in 197s."
McGovern encouraged can»

didates to support programs that
work towards racial and social
‘equality. He called on the cane
‘dates to support the Supreme
ourt ruling on busing to
desegregate schools, or to come up
with a viable alternative

in which to enforce anti-trust laws

Performances are scheduled for 8
o'clock and 9:45. Tickets are
available from the Forum desk,
with one ticket allowed per college

Most \vhoare unfamiliar withhis
.usic will be surprised by Kirk's
technical proficiency alone. He
ventures into sound With three
saxophones, a stritch, and a nose
ﬂute, often performing on these
instruments simultaneously, He is
ﬁomctimes known also by his
ability to inhale air into his mouth
as he eXhales it into a Wind in-
‘strumcnt, thereby enabling him to
sound a series of notes or a single
note for as long as he wishes. The
end result of this “circular
breathing technique” can
‘sometimes remind one of

plans. He suggested that can

drawal from South Korea before
the United States becomes em-
broiled in another war.

Accepting the largest share of
the blame for the 1972 defeat,
McGovern cited inadequate
preparation of the $1,000
guaranteed annual income
proposal, staff disorganization and
disputes and the delivery of his
nomination speech at 3 a.m. as his
mistakes.

After McGovern's speech each
Candidate talked for ten minutes.

generalities. They came out in

Kirk’s performance highlights a
November concerts program
which will also feature Chicago
blues artists Martin, Bogan, and
Armstrong in South Lounge on
November 22, and jazz pianist
Stanley Cowell on November 29.
Martin, Bogan, and Armstrong
appeared here previously in
September 1973, eliciting a highly
favorable response. Stanley Cowell
is currently a member of the
Jimmy Heath Quintet, who per-
formed in Roberts last November.
Cowell has released a number of
albums on his own, playing with
such jazz artists as Reggie Work-

Woody Shaw, and will give two solo
performances in South Lounge.

challenges.

After McGovern’s speech there
were always a fair number of
people moving around the
Coliseum. Each candidate had set
up a booth in the rear Where their
supporters distributed and
fastened buttons and stickers onto
people. The candidates appeared
at their booths to shake hands and
talk. Carter workers passed out
peanuts, Udall supporters pushed
”Munch for Mo" tacos and large
red, juicy apples were provided by
Jackson.

Alter it was all over, a large part
of the audience traveled the few
blocks to the reception at the lowa
State Student Union. There they
had a chance to talk to the can-
didates, munch and drink beer.

Though Grinnell students who
attended the dinner generally
enjoyed the experience several
commented that ten-minute
speeches did not provide much
information about the candidates.
“It was hard to learn anything in 3

ten-minute speech.” stated Steve
Dreyer. “At the end at the program
it was hard to remember who said
what, without thinking about it for
awhile.”

“All the speeches were so
similar," exclaimed Julie Bell.
“The only thing i found out was
more people to research."

One student took a stronger
stand. “I don’t think any of the
candidates said anything
reasonably intelligent.” she said.
“Obviously none of them are going
to get the nomination. They’re just
a bunch of nothings , . . There’s no
reason lor anybody to vote for
them H

Ben Sparks, however. stated that
the dinner was a good way to find
out about the presidential can~
didates. He said that he was ime

Udall, brother of Morris Udall
have already been on campus this
year.

Precinct caucuses to be held on
January 19 are only the iirst step in
delegate selection in Iowa. Grin-
nell is divided into four Wards all of
which will select delegates who
will go on to County and then
congressional district conventions
where national convention
delegates will be elected, Under
Democratic party rules, delegates
to the next highest level are chosen
according to the demonstrated or
uncommitted support at the
precinct level. So if one candidate
wins 25 per cent of the delegates at
the precinct caucus level he should
end up with 25 per cent of the Iowa
delegation.
