THREE GERMANS REACH

American Battalion Catches Raid-
‘ > ing Party in Middle of
No Man’s Land

Anson Smallcy, e. 17, in a letter to
‘llls bi-otlicr, Harold Sinalley '21, (lee
scribes his first battle in the trenches,
in which the Germans after starting a
barrage, rir-e made a raid on the Amelie
can trenches and forced the Americans

to show theiri “that the U, S. was iiot'

thcre merely ior instruction.” Smalley
is now supply sergeant in Co. A ot the
168th lntairtiy. Hts letter follows

By .inson h rrillry. tx-‘li

We have had our ﬁrst hit in the
trenches and are on our way back to
rest and equip again. Our battalion
was iii what was supposed to be a
quiet sector and a couple of days be-
fore it came our time to withdraw, the
Ger-mans got nasty and had to he re-
minded that the U. S.‘\V£Is not there
only for instruction. About [our o'clock
in the morning they turned their heavy
guns loose and under- cover oi their
rir-e attempted to advance on our from
line.

.i'll tell you it didn’t take our al'til»
lery long to get into action and in no
time the Germans tound themselves
between two ﬁres. You see the
Deutscli artillery was playing on our-
line and when the U. S. battery startcd
to pound their trenches it lett the raid
iiig party. in the middle oi No liaii'
hand with no sate way out. Our boys
in the trout liric lard iiglit to their ini-
chine grins and trench moi-tar every
minute and in about four hour-s the
noise was oyel'.

'I‘hrcc fro nus Lcr‘t,

As tar as I know only three Germans
got into our trench and hclieye mc
they didn’t stay very long. Of course
we don't know just how many Ger-
mans we started on the long, long trail,
but we have a good idea that it was no
small number. Our battalion lost a
row good men train their artillery ﬁre,
but it was a good ratio and creryoiic
is proud ot the way the Americans
held under their ﬁrst tire

it seems the French are in the habit
oi going into their dugouts when the
Germans start a barrage and waiting
there until they hit their tire to let
their troops in, then coining out and
battling hand to hand. Our boys stdye
ed by their grills during the barrage
and when they litted it more wcre iio
Germans to come over our "Ll'encli.
The German los es counted, too, tor
the troopers were oi the Prussian
guard, the best they liavc in Germany.

Company A had no ca raltres what-
cver and I won't mention the iiicir
he lost as they will he in the papcrs
over there '

liarc blmItl Quin-tors

Ollr living quarters here are, tor the
most part, very good. We are liable
to he in barracks for a week their more
to a town and be quartered in houses
tor a while. For the nrost part rvc
have been in houses and they are far
more coririortable than barracks.

In every town we have had the best
company orticc oi the brrirch and many
oi us, including Winn-ode, the com—
pany clerk, and 1, have tourid ﬁne
quarters with some French family.

My main duties are to look otter a
a wagon, a driver and tour mules, and
get all the stuit hauled from the sup-
ply company to the town we happen
to be quartered in. Then, too, I have
to order and issue all the equipment
that the iellows use, and when we arc
in the trenches or in reserve, I have to
see that the grenades and ammunition
get to the company dump and then to
the man.

lins t'lrarge or (‘onipnny Property

We havc done a lot or 1110\ng and l
have charge 0[ all the transportation
oi tlic company's property. We are
still unsettled and will be rrntil the
whole regiment has taken its turn in
the trenches and is back in the rest
camp.

You see when the regimcnt starts
tor the irobt the battalions rotate troni
reserve to support to trcnch, then trom
reserve to support again. Each bat»
ta’lion gets a turn in the trench and a
conplc oi turns in positio - tin-thei-
