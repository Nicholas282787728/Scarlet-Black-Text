This' IS your lizard on drugs

Clark Lindgren, Biology, is conducting research on lizards to further investigate how nerves in the
brain communicate and discovered that endocannabanoid occurs naturally in the human body

by SARAH MIRK

Clark Lindgren, Biology, took a
circuitous scientific route to teaching
and researching biology—first studying
physics, then physiology, then neurobir
ology and ﬁnally joining the Giinnell
Biology department in 1992.

Now his career has taken another
uiicxpccted turn. His most recent ,6,
search concerns a chemical dear to
many college students: cannabis

This year, Lindgren is on his third
sabbatical and is researching an area so
new that he and his student reseaich
assistant, Zach Newman ’08, have had
to construct their own equipment.

All of Lindgren's research revolves
around deciphering the way nerves in
the brain communicate, a job that re-
quires dissecting hundreds of lizards,
isolating certain nerves and seeing how
they react to electrical stimulation.

“The really interesting thing that
we've just discovered is that [a naturally
occurring chemical] muscarine causes
the release of another chemical, endo-
cannabanoid,” he said. “I don't know
if you've heard the word cannahiinoid.
Have you heard of cannabis?"

The active ingredient in maiij’iiana
is a naturally occurring chemical in the
human body, so nerves in the brain are
naturally receptive to it. Bodies react
physiolog1cally and humans feel high
when they consume cannabis

“We don't have that receptor but
cause we were one day discovering we
could smoke gmss,“ Lindgren said. "But
it certainly explains why it can have
such a profound effect on mood, on
memories, on all those things."

It took scientists so long to discover
this phenomena because cannabis is
fat-soluble, making it very difﬁcult to

work with' in the lab Over the summer,
Lindgien and Newman set up the re-
search lab by hodge-podging together
a ﬂuorescence microscope, a digital
camera and a meldl tray called “The
Robot."

In the midst ot’thc nuts bolts and
wires or the expensive lab machinery,
Lindgren points to a small clip held to
gether with donated dental wax. That
miniscule clip suspends a lizard nerve
in the center of the n1achincs.“T§his is
where the biology happens,’1Lindgren
said.

The work with cannabis and Lizard
nerves is helping to explain why the
human brain works the way it does.
Lindgren describes the communication
between brain nerves as a conversation,

“But when we have all the nerves in
the brain, it’s like it party there are
so many conversations going on at once
that you can’t understand what anyone
is saying," L1ndgrcn said. “But what if
you could rake two or those people at
the party and put them in a separate
room all by themselves?Thei1 you could
study their conversation."

Discovering that the human mind is
naturally receptive to the active ingre-
dient in marijuana is one step toward
ﬁguring out that larger conversation.

Lindgren arrived at the junction of
lizards and cannabis after many years of
schooling. He began at VVlieaton Coir
lege as a physics major. But during one
memorable lab involving the dlSSEC'
tion and electrical stimulation of frog
nerves, he tell in love with physiology

“If there was ever an ‘Ahtha!’ met
ment, it was then, when I walked into
the lab and actually saw on this instru-
ment the phenomena of nerve imr
pulse," Lindgrcn said. “I can't really der

this really dcep connection between a

at it with the same sort or device you
would use to troubleshoot your radio if

Lindgren has spent his life studying
this intersection between technology
and biological Life.

The author of his physiology text-
book liad an M.D., so Lindgrcn decide
ed he, too,would go to medical school,

“I was totally clueless I went of?
thinking medical school was going to
be the answer to my intellectual yearn-
ings I knew where I wanted to end
up, but I didn't know how to get there."

Lindgren soon got his education
sorted out and graduated with a PhD.

in physiology and took up postdoctoral
schooling at Duke.

After a few months or prergradur
ation panic when his job applications
turned 11p no offers, Lindgren round a
position at Allegheny college in Penn
sylvania and three years later moved to
Grinnell.

“I thought the most intellectually
stimulating thing a sc1entist could do
was be a researcher, hut Students
come in and ask questions that nobody
would ever ask, because they’re not
quite as blinded by the theories and the
preconceived notions of people in the
field,"

Lindgren's current research has not
yet been published, but he hopes itwill
appear in the 1111111111 tszbyxio/agy be
fore the end otthe year.
