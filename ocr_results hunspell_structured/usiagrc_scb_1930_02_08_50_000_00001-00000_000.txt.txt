Appear in Discussion

Yesterday.

A new debating relationship was
begun yesterday when the first dc-
bate between Grinnell and Cornell
women was held in the A. P.. H.
auditorium at 3:30 in the afternoon,
on the subject of disarmament.

Cornell upheld the affirmative and
Crinnell the negative, of the ques-
tion; “Resolved: that the nations of
the world should adopt a plan of
complete disarmament except for
such police forces as may be neces-
sary‘to enforce law and order.”

Winifred Neilsen, Vera Shonts and
Margaret Wood debated for Grinnell;
Cornell was represented by Miss
Trump, Miss Fowler and Miss La-
bargcr.

stressing the fact that armament
means war and disarmament means
peace, the affirmative pointed out
that the destruction of arms, which
would lower governmental expenses.
would'therefore lower taxes. A firm
faith in lasting peace would cause
the raising of wages. with the rise
in wages, the working man would
have a greater buying power, and,
hence. production would grow to sat—
isfy a larger market. Because
"arms are economic exploitation,

leadership," declared Dean Shelton

meeting of the Y. w. C. A. Thurs—

leaders, the responsible, who make
their own decisions, and the respon-

responsible type of leadership which
they will need after graduation.

Fighting Pioneers Lose, 21-20,
to Powerful Creighton Team

in Tense Conference Contest

Invaders’ 10-2 Lead in First Minutes is Overcome, and

Grinnell Team Outplays Creighton Until Foul

Turns Tide

Grinnell’s last bid for possible
Missouri Valley Conference basket-
ball championship honors was unroll-
ed before a Shouting, maddened
throng of students and townspeople
in the men's gymnasium here last
night, but that bid proved just a
fraction Short in Whatever unit is us-
ed to measure basketball quality and
the breaks of the game. The Pio-
neers lost to the Creighton basket-
men, 21-20, without an overtime per-
iod.

Call it What you will, David meet-
ing Goliath, pigmies verses giants.
the Crinnell-Creighton game of last
night will go down in the annals of
basketball history in red ink with the
Missouri game of two years ago, as
one of the feature games of the
Grinnell court. The game was to
Grinnellians what Waterloo
must have been to Napoleon—a
bid for a superhuman victory, only
to see it snatched away at the very
and by some unexplainable trick of
tale.

It was a g‘étllant little band of Pio—
beers that fought to the final gun
with a steadiness that could not be
denied. Snarling and tigerlsh on the
defense and hard passing demons on
the offensive, they give as thrilling
an exhibition of basketball as might
be witnessed anywhere and stamped
themselves as the outstanding Iowa.
team of the season.

Creighton Takes Lead

The game opened dismally for the;
home squad. Big Brud Jensen, tow-'

Smith Hall B, 19-9.

Three B had little difficulty in
turning back the Smith Hall five
1973 Friday afternoon in the fourth
‘round of intramural basketball. The
game was very slow and neither
team showed any aggressiveness. A
difficult one-handed Loss by ROSS af-
ter missing a setup was one of the
few high spots of the game. Grounds

man on the court, while Bray and
Smith did the best work for Kelly

made the first score on a gift toss.
Baskets followed in quick succession
with Van Ackeran, Worthing and
Corcoran on the throwing end. Ba-
fore the game was three Tniilutes old.
Gi-inneil trailed, 7 to 0. With the
first half half way gone, Creighton
still led, in to 2, when Douglas
found the hoop with one of his fancy
goals. It was just a starter and
the next eight minutes saw the scar—
let shirted midgets not only cheating
their visitors out of the tip at cen-
ter but working through the blue de~
fensive wall for continual scores.
Bobby DeLong bit the loop three
times himself. At half time the
score board carried the score at 15
to 13 with Grinncll leading.
Pioneers nave Margin
Both teams showed strong defens-
ive combinations early in the second
half. But for the change in Creighv
ton defense, Grinnell might have
Workeg into a safe lead, but the ulti-
mate winners were ever watchful
and with four minutes left in the
contest. Crinnell was clinging to the
top only by the small margin of 1a
to it.
Foul Disnrganizec Squad
Here came a break which was to
mean the turning of the score.
Humphrey, in guarding Jensen, had
been handling the giant with facility.
holding him without a field goal. He
was standing behind Jensen at this
time, between the huge center and
the Creighton hoop. Suddenly he
reached around and waved his hand
in front of Jensen's eyes. Coach
Schabinger of Lhe Creighton team at
once asked the referee to call a foul,
although the official had not seen fit
to do so until the mentor reminded
him of it. The demanded foul was
given on the technical basis of un»
sportsmanlike conduct while a roar-
ing crowd shouted its boos at the big
visitor and pleaded with the Pioneers
The sudden turn swept the
Pioneers off their feet and while they
were disorganized a substitute, Dav
vis, sent a long shot hurling through
the net and Grinnell led 13 to 17.
Another shot by Davis with two min—
utes to play sent Creighton into a 13
to 13 lead and Van Ackeran made
two free throws good when fouled
by Murray to make the total 21.
With a minute and 16 seconds to play.
Ruff dropped one through the hoop
from mid floor but the Bluejays
managed to stall the remainder of
the time to protect their lead.
McCrcory Fights
Probably no greater exhibition of
sheer fight combined with good has-
ketball has ever been given here than
last night. Little DeWitt McCreary.
miniature sophomore ba'sketeer, dove
and dashed after the sphere with
ability which made the huge Jensen
look positively out of place. Dri -
bling past man after man or crash—
ing through all obstacles to get the
ball, Mac played one of the greatest
games a man might show in such a
contest. Douglas accounted for some
of Grinnell's stellar defense by his
prevention of tip—in shots with long
high leaps to take the ball on the
rebound, snatching it from Jensen's
fingertips continually. He also held
the touted Van Ackeran down to a
trio of field goals, all of these being
first half efforts. Humphrey's ex-
ploits in keeping Jensen under cov-
er have already been recounted.
Ruff’s calm flqor play, DeLongs
ready basket eye, Murray's quick
pivots all played a part in making
the game one of the greatest in
years. '
