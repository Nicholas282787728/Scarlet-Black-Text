Where TF—did these Volunteers come from?

BYSOLOMONMILLER

Grinnell students are known for their
drive for social equality. But now. more stue
dents are turning beliefs into action.

More students are applying for programs
during semester breaks like
Alt Break and ReNew and
programs for graduates, like
Grinnell Corps and Teach for
America (TFA), than any time
in recent memory.

“We've been talking about
building a culture of service at
Grinnell for a long time, and
this is something where we’re
really seeing that," said Doug
Cutchins ’93, Director of $07
cial Commitment.

Over 100 students applied
for at least one social justice trip over Spring
Break. 75 students applied for only 32 spots
between the four Alt Break tripktrips the
school offers for students interested in doing
volunteer work over their break. 53 applied
for 40 places on the ReNew tripsiwhcre
students can help rebuild in areas affected by
natural disasters. The Chaplains trip will only
take 12 ofits 18 applicants.

Karl Kremling '10 is an Alt Break Coors
dinutor and is leading the Alt Break program
this spring in Texas, He attributes the high
involvement rate to the nature of the program,

“Not only does Alt Break allow you to do
some pretty unique volunteers
ing," Ktemling said. "It allows
you to live communally with a
group of people you might not
otherwise have known.”

Cutchins thinks dedicated
student leadcrs—like Kren‘r
lingeare responsible {or the
increased student involvement

“They’re the ones who real-
ly move the program forward,"
Cutchins said.

According to Kremling,
Alt Break supports Grinnele
lians who want to take initiative during their
Spring Break. Because trips are chosen based
on student proposals, they represent the issues
that students most care about.

“We can quickly adapt to the volunteering
interests or the campus community," Kreme
ling said. “I like to think of [South Texas] as
possibly a pretty sexy topic."

In addition to the volunteering options

over breaks, many Grinnell students get ins
volved while at school. The new community
Service Coordinator. Rabbi Howard Stein,
supports student efforts on campus. Stein is
working on setting up new programs to pres
vide more options to students, including

a possible tutoring program

with local schools,

“Seeking out those op
portunities is part of what
I do, so that I can engage
more students in this kind
ofwork." Stein said.

Anna Friel ’10, who
will work next year as a high
school math teacher in New
Orleans as a TFA corps mem
ber. believes Grinnellians take the
values they learn at Grinnell with them when
they graduate.

“At Grinnell, [students] become commit-
ted to these issues, and they stay committed
after they graduate," Friel said.

At Grinnell, Friel was a co-leader of the
Feminist Action Coalition and a peer mens
tor with the Sexual Health and Information
center. She also went on a ReNew trip over
Winter Break

Whatever happens to all of those

Student initiatives are a unique op-
portunity for students to use the StiFund
to bring about change to campus through
a bi-yearly vote. While students need 100
signatures to get their proposal on the bai-
lot, the signatures are not hard to come by
allowing for a slew or various proposals to
see fruition.

They have ranged from proposed dine
ing hall changes—a common requestito
a proposed name-change tor the school it
Selfiln 2006, 25 percent ofstudents voted
for Grinnell to be renamed the “Richard
J Walker ’04 Conservatory of Awesome-
ness." Over 100 student initiatives over the
past 11 years have called for a plethora of
various actions— the construction of a bore
dello, the devotion ofa room in the JRC to
bean bags and the restoration of peace to
the galaxy.

Various students under the moniker
Wedge Antilles requested that Grinnell
restore peace to the galaxy in 2006, but it
was Grinnell’s own Brooks Brunner and
Kate Ottesen who asked students to “be
less dumb” in 2003. Both initiatives failed,
although an initiative to increase the fre»
quency of nachos in the dining hall passed
in 2007 with 67 percent of the vote. Grin-
nellians seem to have surprising priorities.
SGA President Harry Krejsa ’10 noted

that student in‘ atives are used to measure
priorities such as these, as well as achieve
changes,
“[They have] served as a barometer of
student opinion," Krejsa said.
The student initiatives do get “real
things” done as well, though.
Last year, an autoerryer
was success
fully installed
in Lyle’s Pub—
which, by the
way, gets its
name from an
initiative, as the
original name
was “the Wedge,"
in reference to
the still-infamous
Wedge Antilles.
This year, students
attempted to build
an ice rink before the
snow melted, despite
not being completed
the students will have the opportunity to
construct it next year. When the snow is
completely gone, tetherball courts will be
erected as a result of another initiative.
The initiatives that have historically
been most successful are those that make
small changes to student life.

"Where it has been most effective are
in bite—sized improvements to student life,
[with] things like the ice rink or the swing
set or bean bags around campus," Krejsa

said.

Students have been
very interested in a more
literal take on “bites
sized improvements."
The most common
initiatives by far have
concerned changes
to the dining hall,
such as nutrition
labeling, ingredie
ent labeling and
a focus on local
roods. Changes
in the Market-
place are diffi~
cult to implement,

however.
“A lot of the things
that involve the dining hall
are harder [to see through] than
people would expect," Bill Mogavero,

Chair of StiFund, said.

For example, labeling food in the dine
ing hall has been requested in three sepa
rate initiatives, and passed in both votes for
which data was’ available. Yet, labeling is
still not available next to each product. Lyle

According to Cutchins, a record 55 stun
dents applied for Teach For America, 15 per
cent of the senior class. 45 students applied
for Grinnell Corps, for only 10 positions.
cutchins sees this as a spike in an already in-
creasing trend orsrudcnt volunteerwork.

“That doesn’t happen overnight, that
doesn't happen all or a sudden. That
doesn’t happen without reason,"
Curchins said. “Some people would like
to say it’s the econom don’t think
that’strueThisissomet ingthatGrin—
nellians have always taken seriously."
Cutchins himself did fullrtime vols
unteer work after ate

tending Grinnell.

He joined the Peace

Corps two years after

graduating.

Stein hopes social justice work will cone
tinue spreading. He said that he hopes to
"make this something that reaches all parts of
the campus."

From numbers to basic observation, it
is evident that social justice is spreading
throughout the Grinnell campus. “A lot ormy
friends have applied forTFA," Friel said. “And
I know a lor ofpeople doing Grinnell Corps."

initiatives?

Bauman, Dining Hall Supervisor, said that
providing such detailed inrormarion with
each meal would require signiﬁcant work.

“It could he done, but it would be quite
a task," Bauman said.

He did point out that nutritional and
ingredient information is available for all
regular meals in the binders by the front
or the Dining Hall. Dining Services has
tried to implement other student initiative
requests, such as greater local roods, as de-
scribed in the Feb. 19 issue of the SME—
see “GALFA restarts, aims to change the
way Grinnell community ears."

The concrete ﬁgures of initiatives that
have been successful is different to ﬁnd,
both those concerning the dining hall
and those about campus issues in general.
While the Student Initiative Committee
(STlC) has records or student initiatives
and those that passed and failed, it does not
have precise records ofwhich passed initiae
tives were actually put into place.

“In the past there haven’t been particu-
od records or what has happened
atives once they got into [STIC].

That’s something that we’re trying to im
prove on this year,"MogaVero said. "I think
in the past there might have been times
that things slipped through the cracks... It
is a shame when things like that get lost,
because they are good ideas."
