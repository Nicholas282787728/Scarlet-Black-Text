parrieular emotions rhar make you remember meaningful
feelings you’ve had during your life, I mean songs rhas srir
you inside. i mean music rhar rakes you over and forces you
so remember rhose evenrs ofyous life which cannos be de
scribed in just words. They are rhe songs shas evenrually
become rhe emorions rhey convey.

This soundrraek is an incredibly eclecric mix of besides
and rare songs, lr has everyrhing from '605 rock ‘n' roll is a
‘905 hybrid ofbasnbacked punk. Each song has irs own origi»

CD REVIEW:

nal personaliry shar makes it srand our on she disc. There
are greas break—up songs like rheThirreenrh Floor Elevasors’
angry “You're Gonna Miss Me," Bob Dylan's sad “Most of
rhe Time,” John Wesley Harding's deferred “I’m Wrong
About Everyshing" and Smog's mellow “Cold Bloodcd Old
Times."

These songs are woven besween more upbeas songs like
rhe Kinks' "Everybodys Gonna Be Happy," Royal Truar's
”Inside Game" and Jack Black: cover of she Marvin Gaye
classic “Let’s Ger lr on." There are rwo rocks from The
Velves Underground. a brillianr group who provides a sound
rhar can only be said ro resemble an exrreniely sad Beasles.
The rhree besr songs on she album are “Always see Your
Face" by Love, “Fallen For You” by Sheila Nicholls and “1
Believe" by srevie Wonder. “Always See Your Face" is a driven
song with a beauriful accompanimenr orhorns reminding a
losr lover rlias rheir relarionship will nor be forgorren. “Fallen
For You“ is a desperare cry ofa woman rrying ro ger rhe
arrenrion ofher admired. is is a grear srory ofa woman [rye
ing so ﬁgure our her onrequired love. Nicholls’ voice is amaa.
ing, cornplcmenred by rhe piano behind her.

Quise possibly rhe besrsong on rhe album is “I Believe”
by Srevie Wonder. A great song by Wonder, iss ssrong lead
and backing vocals force shis song so sray iri lisreners heads
for hours. It is a person's calling for real love in a world of
hardship. This song seals she album and closes it on a posi»
rive nose. The album rakes rhe lissencr on a verirable
rollercoasrer ofcrriorions as it changes from upbear ro mel.
aneholy and from elassie rock-n-roll to Motown.

The Hrg/J Free/rev soundrrack is a perfecs example ofan
album shar exempliﬁes emorion. ls shifrs irs inoods bur it
shifrs in a realisricway shas everyone has done before, which
makes it more rhan lisrenable. It makes it urrerly pleasing
plus, it gives she lisrener exposure so rare songs we probably
would never have heard. It saves us rhe rime oflisrening ro
quantities of old records looking for songs ro express our-
selves, is may even provide us with a few songs we could use
for our own musical autobiographies

Sleater-Kinney’s All Hands On The Bad One

SleatersKinncy fans have known since 1995’s SCIf»[i[|cd do
but: rhis band is re d ro—serve and rhe helpings of ralenr
and punkpop sens

On this latest release, Tuckcr's trademark slightly off-beat,
quavering rarerwauls are less dominanr, rraded for righr, lucid
harmonies that the whole band can share. Songs are dense,
srrong and carefully implemenred, as SlcarcrrKInncy puts

‘ The had one is everyrhing we wanr so

Tucker, Weiss and Brownsrein are nos afraid ro reﬁecr

FREQUENCY

By Matt Mccormick
The Bollolion (Texas Aer U.)

(U-WIRE) Fugimit-y is an outstanding thriller filled with
srrong performances and clever wriring. Part science ﬁcsion,
parr mysrery and pars drama, rhis movie is one ofshose ﬁlms
shar actually delivers on she promises made in irs rrailer.

Frank Sullivan (Quaid) is a ﬁreﬁghrer who died in a
warehouse fire in 1969. John Sullivan (Caviael), his son,
now a policcman, ﬁnds Frank’s old ham radio in 1999. A
nasural phenomenon allows she two to communiease
rhrough she radio, even rhough rhey exiss 30 years aparr,

This eonimiiniearion changes she peer, and suddenly
everyrhing is different for John in rhe presenr. He ﬁnds rhar
he muss solve crimes rhar are more rhan 30 years old while
facing a danger in she presens. .

It is avery inrelligenr rhriller sharwelcomes she shinking
person. However, it does nor sry so go over audienccs’ heads.
Director Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, Fallen) continues his
srring ofbig screen hirs wirh his boss ﬁlm yet. He manages .
to balance all of this story‘s many elements and build tcn-
sion with a subtlety that is sublime.

The srory irself is amazing. The sheme of a gerring a
second chance is grear and rhe careful arrenrion ro derail is
also impressive.

However, this movie would not work without the great
performances by Quaid and Caviacl. Quaid is one of she
mosr underrared acrors working, and he delivers rhe goods
in rhis film, rurning in one of his moss illustrious perfor»
mances.

Caviezel, who rurned in a sranmaking performance in
The Thin Red Linc, shows that he is definitely one of thc
upvandscomcrx in movies.

His evcry emotion is evident in his face, and he makes
she audience feel whar he feels wirliour saying a word.

Frequency is one of the moss original and inrellrgenr
thrillers [0 be released in a long time. it delivers the suss
pense, bur more imporranrly, ir delivers she emorion.

This movie- works becausc, in the and, viewers really care
about what happens so the characrers,
