Plans for institutional and bud-

Vget planning VP replacement

uncertain, Osgood says

Bv SARA MILLHOUSE

One Sunday in May 1998, Jonathan Brand had a
feeling that he Should go into his othce ar Cornell Law
School and check his email.Walrlng in his ‘Inbox was an
email from Ihenrdean of Cornell Law Russell Osgood
with the subject “your future."The email invited Brand
(0 work with Osgood at Grinnell College. Currently,
Brand serves as vice president of institutional and bud-
get planning, special assistant and counsel to the presi-
dent and a lecturer in political science. -

Brand may not have learned about his newest posi-
rion in such a surprising way, but on Feb. 21, Brands
future took another turn, when the Doane College
board of trustees announced Brand as Doanc's :lcvcnth
president.

his family plan
to movc to Na-
braska in mid-
July»

Osgood said
h: has not mad:
as dcclsion about
how to replace
Brand, “I’m
planning on talk
ing a month andjust listening," Osgood said. “Notjust
to administration but also to faculty, and ifn student had
Something to say I would love to hear from anyone who
wants to take time Io come in,"

He did not elaborate on whether Brand’s transfer
would bring any changes to the administrative structure.
“First. it’d be great ifwe could save some money,"he Said.
“And Second, ir’d be great ifwe had more diversity. And
those things don't move you in the same direction."

When the S63 ran their first version of“Who’s in
charge here?" three years ago, the college’s top nine ad—
mlniscrators were men, and all but one wars white.

Since then, not much has changcd. Higher-lcvcl
administmtion is a more “stable group” than faculty or
lower-level staff, "so it’s a slow process," said Frank
Thomas, vicc president for diversity.

After working at Willamette College,“I was shockcd
when I came here," said Jim Sumner, dean of admissions
and ﬁnancial aid, about the lack of color and gcndcr di-
versityin high administrative positions at Grinncn.

Thomas spoke of thc difﬁculties of tccruiting di-
versc faculty and staff to Ihc middle oflowa. “I’m trying
to think about this in ads," he said. "How do you get
cicy people past that initial, ‘Iowa? Ifwe can only ger
them here, then they see that it's a really nice place to
raise their kids."

As vicerpresidenr for institutional and hudger planr
ning. Jonathan Brand oversees the process of Construcrr
ing the college's annual budget, does longrrange insllnk
rional planning and assists the president.

Brand evonrually ended up in college adminisrrur
Ilon “because of Russell," he said. After reaching French
and working as a lawyer, Brand mer Osgood at Cornell
Law School. where he was Osgood’s research assistant,
taught legal writing and did academic support.

“I've known Russell for twelve years," Brand said.
“It’s hard to leave that. He’s a very close friend and 2|
mentor."

Anorher challenge in his new position will be rund-
rarsing, he said, “It’s a place with hunger and big aspira-
tions for ItselfThe faculty want to do more, and I don't
fccl like they have the resources ro do that. Grinnell is
up in the stratosphere, and their ﬁnanccs are down in
the Icnl world."

Brand also drew some comparisons between Grin-
ncll (Ind Dollne.“Fiindrimcnml.ly, it's rl lot llk: Grinncll,"
he said “II’S u liberal arts school, really old... and was
founded hy Congreganonalisr ministers," he said.

At the same time, Brand said that leaving Grin-
ncll is very difﬁcult. "Grinnell is really Special," hc said.
“There's only one Grinnell."

”/m planning on taking a man”;
and just /l'slenl'ng. / would love
to hear from anyone who wants
