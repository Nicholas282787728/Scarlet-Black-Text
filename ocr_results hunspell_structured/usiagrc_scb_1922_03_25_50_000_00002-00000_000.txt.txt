“THAT REm’DS ill-E”

There is an axiom that ”birds oi a
feather flock‘ together." From the
time that the hoy or girl enters grade
school, each has his “gang" or her
“crowd.” This all ation with a deﬂs
nite group is to he expected, not only
in outside activities but in social re-
lationship as well.

cliques are an indication or a heal-

within limits and individual groups
do not attempt to become dominant.
Ii one group of students seeks to ad ,
vunce itseli unduly, or feels that it
is superior to the other groups which

it becomes a detiinient and should he

Isn't it true that “pride gneth before

mean birth of the iiuttcrfly if the lat-

self by his own arrogance:

“As in the sunshine oi the morn a
butterfly but newly horn sits
proudly pcrhing on a rose, with
pert conceit his hosom glows. [dis

"What arrogance!" the snail res
plied. "How insolent is upstart

to complain, I had concealed thy
