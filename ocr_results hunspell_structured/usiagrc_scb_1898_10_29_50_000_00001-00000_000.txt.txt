Ellls.

In the absence of tile president,
Miss Lillian Smith, tile ticerpres-
ident took the chair, and the nreetr
ing was opened with a piano solo
by Miss Blaine Miller. Miss Anr
na Field read a modern dialect
story, "Maria’s Mournin’. " Tltis
is Miss Field’s ﬁrst appearance
and she promises to be a valuable
member.

Miss Lucy Tallman gave an in
teresting tall: on the “Pension
Act," after which Miss Smith
thoroughly reviewed Louisa Pool‘s
book. “The Red Bridge Neigh-
borhood." The last number on
the program was a piano solo by
Miss Florence Anger.

Calccagathia.

Calocagathia‘s program Friday
alterncon was one keeping
with the spirit of the time, the
general subject being Halloween,

The ﬁrst number on the pro-
gram was a paper by Evelyn
Wilson on the origin and Signiﬁ-
cance of Hallowe'en, treating of
its beginning among the Drulds
and its observation among an-
,cient peoples.

Miss Henderson spoke of Hale
lowe'en observances, especially
those of the Scotch and Irish.
She added much to the interest
oithe theme by her ﬁne recita»
tion of one of Burns’ dialect
poems. This -is Miss Hendcr
son’s ﬁrst appearance in thc soci—
ety and she has certainly shown
herself a valuable addition and
one of whom Calocagathia will
be proud.

Miss Hartwell's original story
was very interesting, relating how
a Hallowe’en joke was cleverly
turned upon the jokers, Miss
Hartwell shows a great deal of
talent as a story writer.

The society was glad lower
come as its guestonc who was a

in

 

Calocagathian a number oi years
ago—Miss Mary Brewer. She
spoke to the girls tor a iew min.
utes bringing out the contrast in
the life of the Amcrrcan and the
Turkish girl.

Helen Starr in giving the cur
rent news showed her usual thorr
ohgh knowledge oi the history oi
the day. discussing the Dreyfus
case, the SpanishrAmerican posir
tion and other topics.

The program as a whole was
one of the most errioyable and
proﬁtable which have been given
this fall. The program for next
Friday is on the noted actors of
the different countries.

Seniors Enter-rained.

Last evening the members of
Lllcsctlior class with a goodly num-
ber oi tlreiaculty were entertained
by Dr. and Mrs. Herl'on at their
homt. on Park street. The (act
that this was the ﬁrst class gatherr
ing of the year, together with the
pleasure of spending the evening
with Dl'.and Mrs, Hermit, made
it a happy occasion for the class
of ’99.

Lively conversation caused the
time to pass rapidly, and bctorc
one could realize it the evening
was gone. The piano solos by
Miss Wyman. of Burlington, who
is the guest of Miss Rand, gave an
added enjoyment to lhe‘ company.

The presence of Mr. l\’l.K Peck.
one of the two members oi the
senior class who enlisted in the
regiments last spring, and who is
just recovCI ing from the fever with
which he was taken sick on his re
turn irom jacks-olivine. gave an
additional cheer to his assembled
classmates and helped complete
the nearly iull ranks or the ninetyr
ninei‘s who enjoyedthe hospitality
of Dr. and Mrs. l'lerron last even~
ing.

The Musical therary Society.

The society was opened by a
paper. “Church Music after l’alesr
trina." by Miss Edna Proctor.
MissMcCor-mick then sangasong
by Cowcn. “The Mission of a
Rose.” Miss Buchanan read a
well prepared paper on Allegri
and his Misercrc. The society
then listened to the reports of the
critic and the program committee,
and alter-a iew remarks by Mr.
Cole regard to the concert

in

 

Tuesday, which he very highly
recommended, the society ad-
jotrrncd.

The New Gymnasium.

Plans forthe new men's gym.
nasium arrived this past week and
will probably be accepted with
but few changes. The archir
tect, as is probably known, is Mr,
H. K. Holsman, '91, who is sitti-
ated in Chicago. The gymna-
will be built of vitriﬁed
brick upon a stone foundation
and will be somewhat similar in
shape and appearance to the
Rand gymnasium although alitr
tie larger. The iurnishings of the
building have not yet been decid
ed upon, but the general outlines
of the plan can be given.

In one end of the basement will
be iound'the lockers, of which
there will be four htlndretl. Ade
joining these there will be a row
of shower baths, sixteen in num-
ber, with three tub baths at one
end and the torletroom at the oth
er end of the row of shower baths.
At the other end of the basement
provision has been made for a
bowling alley and a baseball cage.
The remainder of this ﬂoor will be
given up to boiler and tucl rooms,
whilc‘ considerable space at one
end, in which a plunge bath might
be ﬁtted up. will be left vacant for
the present. It has been found
that the cost of simply keeping a
plunge bath in working is so great
that it is out of the question to
thrrrlt of having one at present.

The gymnasium ﬂoor proper
will be 65x1 l4 feet in size with an
apparatus alcove at one side 13x
37 feet and with an ofﬁce and
measuring room on the opposite
side. each [2Xl4% feet.

The gallery will contain a run-
ning track 100 yardsin circumfer»
ence. Thisit is said is larger than
the running track in the Harvard
gymnasium and will make less
than eighteen laps necessary to
completearnilc. on this ﬂoor
there will be a trophy or class
room of the same size as the ap-
paralus alcove below, and a
visitor’s gallery of considerable
size opposite. This gallery will
be separated from the running
track. and this will be an advan-
tage in many iCSpccts.
