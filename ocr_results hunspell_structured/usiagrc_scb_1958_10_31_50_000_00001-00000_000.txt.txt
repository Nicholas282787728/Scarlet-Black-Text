K“ or,

A $200 increase in the comprehensive charges at Grin-
nell next year was passed by the Board of Trustees at a
meeting this week. This information has been communi-
cated to Grinnell students and parents in a bulletin released

Wednesday.

$170 of the increase is in tuition charges and $30 in

the rooming fees.

“The costs at Grinnell as else-
where are rising,” stated Pl‘esir
dent Howard R. Bowen. “There
is no alternative if we are to
maintain quality in our teach-
ing staff and physical fn‘eilities.
Students and their parents must
bear at least part of the impact
of rising costs and inflation.”

In :1 Scarlet and Black in-
tcrvicw, Bowen pointed out
that other schools in the Mid-
west Conference are also be»
ing forced to raise their costs.
In addition, he said that: “the
U. S. Office of Education re-
ports this year’s expenses at
both public and private unl-
icgcs throughout the country
have gone up an average of
between $150 and $200, and
other surveys reveal most col-
leges will raise charges again
next year."

Bowen emphasized that facul-
ty salary increases, past and
prospective, affect the tuition
rise. ”Faculty salaries go up as
enrollment goes up across the
country. There isn’t a propor-
tionate increase in the number
of professors and the demand
for them is therefore greater.”

Financial Aid

Each year Grinncll awards
$200,000 in scholarships and
gi'ants»in-aid plus between $50,-
000 and $60,000 in campus en-
ployment. Students coming from
families of little means can
also qualify for long-term loans
repayable after graduation and
without interest until they leave
school, A student with little but
ability and determination can
finance his education at Grin-
nell through a combination
of scholarships, work, and loans,
Bowen said.

“Oui- financial aid is award-
ed primarily on the basis of
need. About 45 per cent of our
students now rcccivc a scho-
larship, zrantJn-ald, employ-
ment or a combination oi
thcm. But cvcn those students
who pay the full charge oi

To All Students:

I plan to hold an informal
question and answer period on
the recently announced changes
in tuition and student: aid. The
meeting will be held in ARH
auditorium at 4:30 pm tomor-
row (Saturday).

Interested students are cor-
dially invited.

l-loward R. Bowen
President

$1,650 are being subsidized
this year by about $1,000," he
added.

Bowen stressed that the col—
lege trustees have re-affi'mied
their policy that “no young man
or young women of character
and superior ability who wants
to attend Grinnell College, and
is willing to make reasonable
sacrifices to achieve his goal,
shall be denied the opportunity
of a Grinnell education for lack
of funds."

By “broadening" the financial
assistance program, Bowen feels
this policy can be implemented,
He pointed out that “to the best
of my knowledge, Grinnell of-
fers approximately twice as
much student aid as any other
Midwest Conference school."

Extended Payments

To meet: the rise in tuition
next year, parents of Grinnell
students will be able to select a
monthly payment plan to fit
the family budget. New extend.
ed payment plans can spread
monthly payments beyond the
four years allowed in the pres
ent program. The college will
offer plans extending over five,
six, seven and (with one year
of pus-payment) eight years, It
also expects to offer life and
disability insurance which will
guarantee payment of college
expenses should the parent die
or become totally disabled,
