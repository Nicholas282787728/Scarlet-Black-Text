The search for the new president

20 of the 124 applicants being 0x7

Grant enables seminars

by linn Flynn

Grinnell has received a grant of
315.000 to “offer faculty members
an opportunity to more broadly
educate themselves." said Dean of
the College Waldo Walker

The money will be spent on
three. [wnrwcek seminars [hat will
take place this Sumnicr. Walker
said Eight [acuity members and

Preparation caurses: are they helpful.

by anlcic (ii-rcnstein

lf“loglczll diagrams" or “major
iactor tprinciplcl sets" don't ring
a bell and you have to take one of
the standardized tests necessary
for admission to most graduate
programs. you might think twice
about how you‘re going to prepare
for the examiif. indeed. you were
going lo prepare for it at all.

The effectiveness of courses
designed to prepare students [or
tests like [he Graduate Record
Exam lGRE). the Law School
Admission Test (LSAT) and the
Medical College Admission Test
[MCATl is in much dispute among
those who run the review courses
and those who develop the tests.

TENS 0F THOUSANDS of
students take these courses each
year. paying between $100 and
$300. depending on the length of the
course and the amount of material
covered.

For the most part. they learn
tosHaking strategy. They are
taught what to expect on the tesm—
the type of questions asked and the
concepts behind the questions.
They are also given the chance to
takea sample test under conditions
similar to those they will be lacing
the day of the actual exam.

STANLEY Ht KAPLAN, founder
of the centers bearing his name.
claims that students who take a
Kaplan review course after a
disappointing iirst score. will
improve their scores on the second
test by an average of 100 points.

And Janet Finklestein. coor-
dinator of an LSAT preparation
course at Adelphi University in
New York. says that while they
don’t guarantee test scores, “any
qualitied student who is really
serious about going to law school
should be able to Score at least 600
points toutof a possible 300) alter

 

taking lhe course If they don't.
and they choose to take the LSAT
again. they can take the review
course for a second lime. free of
charge.”

FINKLESTEIN SAYS [hat
although the Educational Testing
Service. developer of the LSAT and
most Standardized tests. claims it
is impossible to study for the
LSAT. you can. and should.
prepare for It.

“You cannot say. ‘Come to the
course and you'll do great.’ You
can say. ‘Cnme to the course, do
the work. study hard. then you‘ll do
well.‘ " she says.

FINKLESTEIN EXPLAINS that
her course familiarizes Students
with the test and teaches them
short cuts so they can finish each
section in [ime.

The Adelphi program is a
relatively new one. Finklestein
says everyone who took the first
session of the course improved
their scores by 50150 points.

ED DEPTULA. assistant to the
administrative director of the John
Sexton Test Preparation Center in
New York City. says their LSAT
review course teaches students to
understand and define the terms
ETS uses in the makeup of the
exam.

“If you don't understand the
terms and how they are being used,
even an intelligent person could be
in trouble.” Deplula says.

HOWEVER. ETS disagrees with
the score-improvement claims or
Kaplan and the other coaching
schools.

Jenne Brittel. executive director
for program planning and con-
sumer affairs for the Princeton.
J.J. firm. says their research
shows that “coaching does not
make a significant difference."

ANYONE. BRITTELL contends.

 

lakilig all ETS lest for [he Second
time will improve their scores by
about 50 oints because they are
more lam r with the test format

Toni White. vice president and
director of [he tester's law
program. says ETS is “unaware of
any evidence that would indicate
that study courses are any more
ciiective than a person diligently
going through the materials that
arc provided tree tby ETSi to
prepare for the test.

"PEOPLE SHOULD not be ad,
vised [0 take the [est cold. Il‘s
foolish of them to waltz in [here
and expect to do their best by not
knowing what [hey‘re going to be
asked or what the routines are."

He says the materials provided
tree by ETS give an elaborate
description of the questions asked
on the test and different strategies
tor answering questions.

“IF STUDENTS Want the [652 [.0
best reflect their aptitude," White
says. “they should get that in
formation and study it in a way
that would not be haphazal‘ ."

White concedes. however. that
every person's response to being
prepared is different, and the ”do-
ityoursell” approach is not totally
cilective for every person.

"IN THAT CASE." he says.
“having a more structured ap-
proach to review class) would
sometimes be advisable."

White also warns students
planning to take the LSAT for a
second time that some schools
discount higher second scores
because they teel students taking
the test a second time have an
advantage.

PROFESSOR MILLARD Ruud.
executive director of the
Association of American Law
Schools. agrees with White on the
effectiveness of preparation

courses

"I don't have any evidence."
Ruiid says. “that cram courses
provide an applicant any ad
vantage ovcr a person who care

provided free in the bulletin of
information for the LSAT "

.lllll STRAFOKI). president of
Now York's lloistra University’s
prerlaw society. says he thinks the
rcvicw courses are actually a
waste of money. because you can
learn [he same things in a review
book costing only about so

Stratord says he used the LSAT
reVlew book published by Arco
Publishing Co to study. and [hat as
far as he could tell. \it covered
everything the review courses
offereditips on how to take the
exam. examples of the different
kinds oi questions. an explanation
of why each answer was right or
wrong and facsimiles of the exam.

STRAFORD. WHO claims he did
well enough on the exam to be
accepted by several schools, says
the prerlaw society is sponsoring a
free LSAT review course using [he
Arco text.

The Medical College Admissions
Test. developed by the American
College Testing Program or lowa
City. Iowa. is different from the
LSAT. in that it is more an
achievement test than an aptitude
test.

DR. ROBERT BER/\N.
associate director of the
educational measurement and
research division of the American
Assnciaﬂon of Medical Colleges in
Washington, D.C.. says that early
information obtained by his office
lndica[es that “students do im»

 

prove when they undertake any
kind oi review." .

By “review." Beran means

he said.

,\T THE MOMENT. Walker
said. there is no formal schedule
for the seminars. He said he ex-
pects participants will spend at
least 20 lloursiliot including
preparation [lmciper week

three seminars sn /\rl History.
Evolution. (lnd Freedom and
\‘ccessity. Walker says no one in

to Slgn tip for the art seminar. and
the biology and anthropology
dcparllncnts will be excluded from

FRESH) T r\. RICHARD
Turner will he the discussion
leader tor the art history seminar.
Kcn Christiansen of the
biology department will lead the
discussions for the evolution
seminar. and the French depart
ment's Morris Parslow will be in
charge of the freedom and
necessity seminar. Walker said.

Walker said he requested the
money for the program so that
faculty members will have more (if
a chance to generalize their
educational backgrounds. “Many
educators are much too
specialized—there‘s not enough
generalization." he said.

A SID l B NEFIT of the
program. Walker said. may come
in the torm or increased general
education for students. He said
once advisers better understand
other disciplines, they will be
more likely [o advise students to
take courses in those areas.

History prolessor A] Jones. a
member of the Curriculum
Committee and proponent of
stronger general education
guidelines. feels this will definitely
aid the general education mood on
campus.

“IT'S PROBABLY GOOD to
begin with the general education of
the faculty." he Said. “There is a
need to educate the college as a
whole as to the implications in the
meaning and purpose of the
general education."

Jones said he is very pleased
with the continued inquiry into
general education. He also said he
expects within a year or two the
iaculty will accept stronger
general education guidelines.
