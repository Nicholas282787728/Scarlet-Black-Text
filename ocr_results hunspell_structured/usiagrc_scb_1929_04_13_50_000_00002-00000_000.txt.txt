DOWNYJOMES TILE CURTAIN.

With this issue of the SCARLET AND BLACK marks
ing the close of the thirty-fifth year as the official news-
paper of Grinnell college, the prescnt‘managcmcnt speaks
for the last time. One final outburst and the present
editorial voice will sink into oblivion. As We appear on
the stage today we do so with the knowledge that the
curtain is falling, and so we shall take a final bow with
_these words in retrospect

Just one year ago we made our debut. We announCr
ed our editorial policy and enumerated the things we m-
tended to do. A glance in the files reveals the following
paragraph taken from our first editorial; .,Accuracy
of news; tolerance and conservatism of editorials; iin.
partiality towards individuals, organizations and faculty;
and an eager desire to be of service in promoting every
thing for the good of the college might be well set forth
as our specific aims. These things, however, are not
necessarily our ideals; rather they are the identical goals
towards which our predecessors have striven and to
which we pledge ourselves."

In carrying out our pledge to you we have borne in
mind another thought voiced in our first editorial. “ . . in
the course of our work it is inevitable that we shall
“tread on sumeuue's toes" no matter what side of a ques~
tion we may take. While we expect to retain the friend-
ship of every reader of this column, we shall not re
tract a statement nor subjugatc our views to find favor
with any group. We anticipate that we shall make a few
enemies, not many, of course, but a few among the minor-
ity of those who fail to adjust themselves to society.
This would indeed be unfortunate, and it shall he our
duty carefully to avoid such a situation whenever possi—
ble."

We believe that We have contributed to a great many
activities on the campus and have fulfilled our pledge
of service. Through this colmun impetus was given to

THE GRTNNEIA‘ SCARLET AND BLACK

the reorganization of student government into its pres-
ent satisfactory form. The present management entered
into their work in the midst of a crisis. For the first
time in history the SCARLET AND BLACK was publish-
ing proceedings of the student court. During the rcor-
ganization stage this paper cooperated with tho admin-
istration and rendered valuable service in the final ar-
rangement.

We vigorously opposed the formation of a student-
fdculty hoard of control for all publications. Convinced
of our stand, we opposed the establishment of such a
board, and we (eel that our attitude bad influence in the
abandonment of the proicct. ‘

Working in close contact with the faculty represenm-
tlves on the athletic committee, we carried complete 30A
counts of the reorganization of the Missouri Valley con-
ference. At the time we urged the admittance into the
conference of Carleton college and Marquette university.
Olli‘ attitude on the matter scems justified in view of the
splendid athletic relationship existing between Grinnell
and these two schools at the present time. While Curler
ion was not admitted, student opinion was stimulated to
a consideration of her admittance. We owe any success
of our agitation to the cooperation of the faculty repre-
sentntivc,

Cur editorials have not only touched on such general
matters of policy but it has also included concrete sug-
gestions that hue been carried out A matter of posts
iug examination and course grades has been successful- l
ly adopted by one department head at the suggestion of
an editorial. Cleanup campaigns, better care {or the,
tennis courts and numerous other things were toucheni
on. The attitude of the SCARLET AND BLACK in re
gard to the dancing situation in Grinnell led to the adop-
tion of the present handling of dances by organizations.

Among our ideas there have been several that have
not been carried out, The point system advocated in a
number of editorials found favor with many of the ads
ministration, although it was not adopted, Nevertheless,|
We continue to insist that the limiting of outside activi-
ties by a point system should be adopted in Grinncl,

“’0 have been censured for things we did and some
We did not do. We have made mistakes and executed
the mistakes of othcrs. We have been called a "crab"
sheet and subtly threatened. We have made enemies, but
we have made many friends, We regret none of the for»
iner. and are thankful for the latter.

Critics forget that the policy is not personal opin-
ion but the concerted opinion of a chosen board. They
seek in vain for initials to identify the writer of some
particularly touching subject, initials were abandoned‘
with personal opinion. The board is forced in the luv.
terests of a common cause to work one for all and all
for one.

We turn the control of the SCARLET AND BLACK:
over to the new management with the next Issue. The
incoming management is not new for they have served
their apprenticeship on the staff for three years, becom-
ing familiar with the mechanical procedure of editing al
paper and knowing the ideals and policy of this publica-
tion. They are men of experience and ability, capable of
assuming charge of the paper and carrying out the task;
of editing a paper that has served Grinnell for thirty-five
years.

“’2 turn the reins of management over at a most
auspicious moment. Never has Grinnell enjoyed more
perfect harmony. Nor do we believe has the future of
Grinneil been more favorable. Student government is
functioning perfectly, the house mother plan has proved
to be an unqualified success, and the morale of the stu
dent body is considerably higher than a year ago.

The only remaining wish in our minds is that the
new management will continue to enjoy the coopera»
tion and friendliness that has characterized our admins
istration. To them we wish a successful year. To Grin—
llell we can only wish for a continuance of the traditional
pionccring and the work that has made Grinnell stand
for what it does.

BELOIT STUDENT
DRAWS CROWDS

Attendance M. Chapel Increases “me
when Council Ens Charge.

Although the students picked the
speakers and arranged the programs
for the chapel scr 'ces during this
last week, known as "Go to chapel
Week," the attendance was only
slightly if any larger than hereto—
fore.

The week was in charge of a Coma
mittee of men working through the
Men's Council of house chairmen, but
it was the women of the college who
filled the majority of the chapel seats.
The attendance Wednesday morning
when Arthur Weimer, a student from
Beloit Collcgc spoke, was the largest
during the week.

Professor Norris speaking on Mon—
day and Professor Lavcll on Friday
drew about the usual crowd. 0n Tues»
day and Thursday mornings when
music was on the program the at-
tendance at women was noticeably
greater than that of the men.
