Stars

Think of the manic energy of Mardi Gras:
partying crowds sprlling out onto the streets of
the french quarter. Now add the sounds of
infarmaljam sessions heard on street corners, by
the docks or on‘ back porches-with a Viddish
twist. The result is a fresh fusion or such Old
World forms as horas, doinas, ad freilachs, and
such New World inventions as funk, soul, and
jazz. Deals Open at 9:30 and the Show starts at
10.10 required.
