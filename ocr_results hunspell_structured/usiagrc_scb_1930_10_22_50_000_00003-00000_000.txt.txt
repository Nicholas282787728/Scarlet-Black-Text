Young Tornmy Hawk has at last
found a certain virtue in our bird
sanctuary. Upon emerging one even~
ing of last week, he was heard to re—
mark: “Well, I think this is great.
I go in with a tan rain coat and come

out with a fall tweed."
e s e:

What we can't understand is—
why on earth such a small thing
as one football game in Des Molnes
could produce such a mgged look-

ing bunch of arimieliinns.

And speaking of the weekend, we
wish to extend all sympathy to Arch-
ie ’Allison who dived into a shadow
only to find that it was on when):-
ment of some proportions.

What a delightful food the mint

are!

Addressing his behaviorism class
yesterday men-ling. Professor Stoops
cleared up a lot of things with the
following sagacious statement: “The
only difference between you and me
is that the lower animals lack de-

velopment of the frontal lobes."

We owe a vote of thanks to
Betty Adams, who goes to the
kitchen and washes casseroles just
for the fun of it.

 

“Love me, love my kitty!" Do.

Well, even if we didn't bring home
the bucket last Friday, we got to
see it anyhow:

r r r
Russ Ruff, one of two fellows
who can hit a dime at 50 yards
with a football (Benny Friedman
is the other guy). now gets his
dates by proxy!
. s s

At any rave, he had another fella
call up a frosh.girl (name on re
quest) and ask her for it date. The
poor girl was already signed up for
the evening,‘ but, having the true
maidenly curiosity, she girlishly quer-
led: “Who is this?"

Why, this is Russell nuif," answer
ed the “gay deceit-er" in an athletic
voice.

“What 9" said the favored miss, as
soon as she recovered her breath,
“Russell Ruff: Oooooooooiloi"

s s i

What a man:
s s. s
The bousemothers are trying to
lead the unsuspecting boys astray!
Why, the other day they got together
'at dinner and yelled that awful yell.
“Are We Downhearted?” right out
loud!
. i a
And, they knew full well what the
boys would answer:

Come on down and get
sacked with a palr of
Phoenix sax.

Just arrived! A whole
mess of them and to sell
for four, six and eight bits.

on, well, what chance has a fella
got against a bunch of girls any-
how?

At this point we wish to state that
Mr, Francis R. Fee, noted writer and
business man, heartily endorses all
coffee sold by Cardirnen's Drug store,
Des Moines~when especially pre-
pared by Woody, the speedball king:

The Smithites seem determined
to go into business. First it was

Well, for ourselves, we're still wait—
ing for the sevoncent nickel we
heard about in the movies:

After these brilliant speeches by
Robbie Stevenson, on the wonderful
advantages of joining the Varsity
club, We were almost too ashamed to
take advantage of the poor fellow by
buying a ticket:

Almost—but not quite:

And, finally, may all the profs who
don't know who plays on the lootball
team, have rheumatism every Friday
night.
