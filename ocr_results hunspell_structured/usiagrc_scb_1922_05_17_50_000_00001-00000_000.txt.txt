Miss Elizabeth Pace of this year’s
,graduaiing class has been chosen as
one of eight girls who are to be given
,a trip to France this summer by the
Omaha Bee. The girls will sail from
,New york on July 22.

The Bee has been conducting a
"Good Will” contest turnout Iowa and
Nebraska under the auspices or the
American Committee for Devasted
France to assist in raising a $2,000.—

America to the French people. Each

, person entered in the contest received

a certain number of votes for each
contribution she secured for the bene-
ﬁt of the cause. The three or four
receiving the greater number of votes
were to receive the trip to France as
a prize. Due to the fact that there
,was much heavy voting near the end
iof the contest the Bee is enabled to
send eight contestants on this trip.
