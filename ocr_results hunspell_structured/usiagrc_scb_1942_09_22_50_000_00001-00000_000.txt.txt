Libe Committee

Toughens Rules

infraction May
Be Punished
By Probation

Because of crowded conditions on
the campus this year and because
the army may share privileges
with the students, the library
committee has brought into ef~
fect new regulations concerning
conduct in the library, Harold L.
Clapp, chairman of the commit-
tee, announced yesterday.

Punishment for misconduct bc-
gins with a warning and can, it
the case is serious enough, lead
to probation for the student, Mr.
Clapp said. After the first war -
ing, if misconduct continues, the
student will be asked to leave the
library.

It further disturbance is
caused by the same student,
suspension from library priv-
ileges results, or the student
may be put on probation do,
pending on the severity of the
offense.

For several years the commit-
tee has desired to make the
library a place for study only but
failed to do so because they felt
there was no real justification for
any change. This year, however,
it is absolutely essential that more
severe regulations be in effect for
the benefit of students who at—
tend collge to further their edur
cation, Mr. Clapp added, as
these students can no longer use
the ARH.

Lois Davidson, Assistant Librarian,
Tells Of Life In Egypt Before War

By Lucid Carier .
“Egypt is a fascinating combine
ation of east and west,” says
Miss Lois Davidson, new assists
ant librarian, who has spent 13
years as a teacher in Egypt. “I’d
like to go back some time."

Miss Davidson was returning
to the United states by way of
the Pacific when war broke out
in September, 1939. She had
planned to go back then, but the
outbreak of war made that ”11'
possible, she said,

While in Egypt, she taught in
girls’ schools in Assiut and
Cairo, which were run by the
American mission of the united
Presbyterian board. The nine
years previous to her return to
this country she spent in Cairo,
Wur Jitters in 1939

“All through 1939 there was
much talk of war," Miss Davids
son commented. "We listened
every night for news from Enge
land, because we were afraid war
was going to come at any iriin-
ute. Most of the natives, how-
evcr were too ignorant to be
afraid,”

“I was in one practice blacks
out before I left," she said, “and
at the school we had lectures on
air raids and the use of gas
masks.”

In 1939 most of the wealthier
and educated classes, particularly
the Christians, were in favor of
the British government, she stat-
ed. However Cairo. being a cose
mopolitan city, is now more than
ever a target for German and
Italian propaganda,

Life in Egypt differs greatly
from anything, here, according to
Miss Davidson. Boys and girls
are separated in their schooling
until they reach college age, and
only recently have girls been ad-
mitted to the universities, she
said.

Only in the last five years I
was there have any girls from
my classes gone to the LIniVeP
sity.

“I don‘t know whether I’llevei‘

concluded," ”But I have friends
there, and I‘d like to go back
