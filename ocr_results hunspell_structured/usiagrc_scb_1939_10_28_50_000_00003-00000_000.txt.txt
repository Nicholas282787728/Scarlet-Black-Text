' SATURDAY, OCTOBER 23',

Insubordination Rears Ugly Head ‘
As Freshmen Dunk Sophomores

snowing little or no respect Io

‘their superiors, the freshmen, on
Thursday after-noon at the coun-
try club pond, tlircw tradition to
the winds, and outpulled a vastly
out-numbered handful of sophor
mores in the annual sophomore-
freshman tug of war.

The preps, ever the eagle-eyed
ones. shortly before the fray was
to commence. found the rope in
a “weakened state" about a quar-
te- of the way up the freshman
side. others of the hell-week sut'»
vivoi-s claimed that water had
been cast upon tlic freshman em-
hanknieiit, ostensibly for the pin»
pose of “easing the fl'eshmen's
path to the water’s edge.”

After ironing out the difficulties
created by the dilemma, and de
nyiiig the demands of the second
year men that all preps without
prep caps be declared ineligible.
the Honor ‘G’, ti- ditional custoda
ians of the fray, in the person of
William “Bud” Pederson. student
council pl'exy, blew the whistle
which started the pulling that
drew the sophomores through the
pond. i

’ The pull was not as difficult as
might be imagined, taking all of
fifteen seconds to convince the
sophomores that further argument
was unnecessary, and they might
just as well come through the
water in a more peaceful like
manner.

Once through the water though,
the freshmen decided that they
had seen enough of the “big boys"
for the time being. and with little
or no discussion of the subject,
retreated en masse ovcr- the hill.

A few unlucky victors were not
so fleet of foot, and being given
up for iost by their classmates,
were captured by the wet ones.
and immediately made subjects of
a game called “Doughnut, dough.
nut. let’s dunk .the doughnut."

After verifying the fact that
no more preps were on the scene
to play the dunking game, the
Honor ‘G’ called off hostilities,
and peace was declared. with the
class of '42, one of the few
classes to go "wading” two years
in a row, going off the field vow»
iiig never to participate in such
an affair again.

Play ‘Our Town’
Follows Simple
Scenery Trend

“The trend in the theatre is more
and more to simple scenery,” said
10 Mielziner, famous stage de»
signer, after seeing the New York
production of Thornton Wilder's
play, “Our Town", which will he
produced here as the homecoming
play. “After all, the people and
the lighting on the stage are the
elements that make the atmos-
phere."

As with the New York produc-
tion. so with the Grinnell produc»
tion. And with the simplicity of
the production goes the simplicity
of the stoi'yiliving, marrying. dy—
ing. the lives of two families,
neighbors, joined in marriage, not
separated by death.

In representing the story, the
author has included in the action
the complete ceremony from the
time the friends and family enter
the church until the two young
people leave, married. The burial
service also is shown as it takes
place in the cemetery. While the
dead sit quietly on one side of
the stage, the stagermanager-
minister reads the service to the
mourners. As the curtain is
drawn. the stage manager casuale
ly dismisses the audience.

Hungary's only course for future
economic independence would be
to form some kind of an alliance
with such countries as Rumania
and Yugoslavia for mutual pro»
teetion against the German and
Russian threats.

If she submitted to Germany,
which is trying to foster hatred
between Hungary and the other
Balkan countries, she would lose
all semblance of economic indt»
pendcnce which the inherently
“proud and defiant" Hungarians
could not accept.
