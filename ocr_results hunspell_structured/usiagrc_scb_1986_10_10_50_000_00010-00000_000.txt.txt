coming off the bench to add “real strength
when we were having problems," she said.

Despite their injuries. Joanne Sackett,
with a bruised thigh muscle, and Melissa
Fitzpatrick, suffering from a hyper-
extended knee. rose to the occasion, pro-
viding good delense and strong blocks
respectively.

Unfortunately rortune proved fickle,

Pioneers succumbed to an “embarassing”
defeat, 1115 415, and 2- 15.

previously rated, she said, ”Our energy
just wasn't there.”

Mueller noted that the team has dif~

“In general, we just got beat, ” remark-
ed Coach Judy Hunter recalling last Satur-
days 3-1 loss to Loras.

Due to soggy conditions the Women‘ 5
Tennis team faced their undeieated Upper
nent indoors in a 10 game Pro Set. But the
competition was tough and No 6 Jill
Shimabukuro served up the only Pioneer
win defeating Karen McNulty 10- a.

Coach Hunter pleased with all “the solid
people coming up to fill in the Varsity
lineup, felt that the Pioneers “played some
good matches. " No. 1 Erika Smith return~
ing last week after illness, played a strong
6am match against Beth Deveaux while
No. 4, Apryl Henry looked tough in herB- to
match against Patty Nicoldi. Maren Van

position didn’t fare much better as Tracy
Westwater defeated her 10 1.

“It’s been very difficult because of so
much change,’ comments Hunter referrr

Owens, Wendy Bair and Not 4 Jean Hor-
nyak will be out for the season,"

Hoping to improve upon their 476 record,
the Pioneers host Cornell this Saturday at

Pioneers Lose Ball, Game

By Walt Maley

Grinnell traveled all the way to Green
Bay last Saturday to go into battle against
the Green Knights of St. Norbert College
Unfortunately, it wasn’t much of a battle.
the Knights winning 35’s on a cool wet day
in Wisconsin. Grinnell scored first on a
69-yard run by fullback Chris Knoeprle.
The Pioneers tailed to get the extra point.
which was indicative of things to come for
them. The first period ended with the Score
6-0, Pioneers. The second quarter was one
that Grinnell would just as soon iorget,
however. St. Norbert riddled the Pioneer
defense far 28 poian to lead at the half 2876‘
The rest of the game was anticlimalic with
only one more score, that being a
touchdown by the Knights for a tinal score
of 3576.

For the second week in a row, the

Pioneers crucified. themselves. This week,, ,

however, it was the offense giv g the ball
away instead of die defense giving up the
big play. in all Grinnell gave up the ball 7
times to St Norbert, which means the
Knights had 7 more chances to score than

Grinnell. The turnovers were spread out
fairly evenly, 4 fumbles and 3 intercep-
tions, so apparently the disease was a con-
tagious one.

As usual, there were a few bright spots.
Grinnell outrushed the Knights 233 to W],
but were outpassed. 283 to 104 yards. Thus,
the game might have been much closer
had the Pioneers not selfdestructed. Both
lines played decent iootball against the
bigger Knights. it the whole team ever
decides to play a whole game at the top or
their ability, it might be interesting to see.

Things don’t get any easier this week
either. Grinnell travels down 1-80 to take
on 008. The Kohawks (don't ask me what
one is) tied with St. Norbert [or the con-
lerence championship last year and were
selected to play in the NCAA division Ill
playoffs. Coe returns, intact, last year’s
league leading defense But besides being
big, strong, tast and very talented they
really dont have a lot going for them.
Grinnell (1-2) takes on Coe (4-0) at C09. on
Saturday.

It was just a routine Mud Loop run,
about 7 miles long. The team was packed
pretty well. We were all drawing off each
other’s strengths, pulling and pushing
each other along, pounding out the pace, I
stretched my stride and my legs had a nice
warm loose feel to them, I was a long
legged gazelle loping easily alongside a
whole herd. There was a feeling of wild
the kind of exhilaration that
comes of fluid motion, open air, clear
skies, and country roads.

And as our tight pack ate up the miles,
the conversation flowed.

When we acutally hit the muddy section
of die “grade B Road 7 Enter at Own
Risk,” the discussio turned, somehow,
from racin’ to streakin’.

The dark mud was just deep enough to
be fun. Our shoes chewed up clods and
chunks mat we kicked up on ourselves and
anyone else close enough to catch the
backlly, I Could feel the added weight of
wet mud caught in the teeth of my soles.
The road was slimy enough to be pleasant-
ly treacherous.

The next thing I knew. Paul “The
Schwies" Schwiesow whipped by with
t»shirt and running shorts in hand. Ooze
was splattered up the backs of his legs . . .
and higher,

The Naked Mud Mile was born

“Only Purple ‘Roos," Coach Will
Freeman says, smiling and shaking his
head. Yeah. the Grinnell men's cross coun
try team is something to watch. The
craziness can begin with just one runner,
and spread from there. . . .

It was like something out of an Andy
Warhol film. Really strange, but a hell ofa
lot ol fun. Thirty of us guys were milling
around the nth Ave. tennis courts, near
the football field. None of us seemed to
know what was going on until somebody
started the ”orb chanti”

“Orb! orb! orb!" it went on forever.
Finally we got their -attention. The
women’s tennis team just stopped their
practice and stood and looked at us like we
were nuts, We continued waving our arms
and shouting.

One of them figured it out She picked up
an applegreen tennis ball. bounced it
once, and swung the racket.

Loud groan. The ball smashed into the
chain-link fence at the back of the court.

She picked up another. This time it flew
up. up, . . . and over. We cheered like
crazy, like little kids at the circus wat~
ching a high-wire act. Whoever caught the
orb lofted it triumphantly, then tossed it to
a teammate. We finally started off on our
run with purpose in our hearts.

We like to vary the places we run to,
Country roads and corn fields and town
running can get . l . well, old. But a run

something!

In my experiences with the team, we've
done Wal-Mart. both Cowles and Quad dine

exit — four solid minutes of deafening,
buzzing fanfare), the Forum Grill, and
various dorms around campus tthe nar-
row halls of Norris echo nicely when we

Norrist") We've also run through Fine

back stairs.

Some of the students we passed looked
up. down, then quickly up again in a double
take, while others laughed and nudged the
person sitting at the table next to them,
Many never noticed. We were completely
silent all during the run. except for the
thousands’ of slightly-audible tootsteps on
padded carpet. We exited and cut loose
with primal screams.

0n the way back to the PEC, we all join-
ed hands around the giant phallic symbol
on central campus for our traditional
“Zirkle Circle,” where we skipped around
once then broke apart and rushed the
sculpture. While some bowed down on
their knees. others embraced the towering
symbol and showered it with kisses. ,

, We got to our feet and fled toward the
loggia, Stampeding through, we sang the
loggia song (10 lo, lo, 10, loggia) in a
clamorous. lusty rendition that would
make John Abel proud ta former CC man
and graduate of Grinnell who “pioneered"
the skirt/hairy legs look)

It may appear as though Grinnell's
distance runners are totally i‘nsane iwe
are). In fact, it may look as though we
could care less about what we're doing.
The truth is, is that the silliness and good
times. the songs and games, and the ap-
parent lack of concern for the sport. all
mask a serious attitude concerning who we
are, what we do, and how we do it. For
every spur-ofrthe-moment release. such as
a quick dip in the ponds at Grinnell Colin»
try Club golfcourse. there are innumerable
moments of work, struggle. and effort.

All of Grinnell’s distance runners are
dedicated to achieving excellence. We
strive to attain a state of balance in not on
1y our running. but in our general lives.
Through running. we search inside
ourselves for strength, peace. and an
awareness of what the world around us is
all about. This thirst for knowledge, this
desire that drives each one of us, becomes
a collective feeling — the winning spir

We. the Purple lines, have a goal: to win
conference Together, we run and work at
searching ourselves for the strength to
win. We will find it.

We have the guts.

Have A Good
