Letters to the Editor.

Dear Editor.

For the past three years Grinnell
students have expressed continual
dissatisfaction with the calendar‘s
lailure to include a ouiier period prior
to final examinations. In order to ad»
dress this grievance. members oi this
yo "5 curriculum council have
rcpcatedly attempted toestablish a
committee designed to investigate
posstble ways to alter the calendar in a
manner conducive to the inclusion of
builer days, On Monday. April l. the
college iaculty overwhelmingly voted
against establishing such a c mittee.
I believe the faculty‘s dec‘ on was
made without due consideration of the
college's proper priority: providing the
best possible education for Grinnell
students.

llenry Walker. designer at the pre-
sent calendar and the faculty's most
outspoken opponent oi establishing a
committee to evalutate the calendar,
asserted that investigating possibilities
for altering the calendar would be a
waste of time Walker based his asset‘s
tion on six considerations that he
believed limited calendar options: 1)
all classes must meet an equal number
ol times and no classes can be madesup
at irregular times. 2) the Fall
semester must begin alter labor day;
‘dl Thanksgiving requires a two day
recess; in Fall break should be one
week lon 5i several days oi vacation
are required prior to Christmas; and.
iii each academic semester should
last 14 weeks, Considering these limita»
lions. Mr. Walker‘s argument is sound.
lloweven i do not accepted the validity
of his six limitations,

The calendar topic is primarily an
educational issue. Vihether or _not
students have buffer days effects not
only the level of stress on campus. but
also the quality of the education offered
at Grinnell (see article on the buffer
days survey). A buiier period prior to
final examinations would allow
students to more careiully review and
synthesize the semester's work. This
ieVieii would iacilitate independent
thinking and greater individual insight.

Mr. Walker's argument implicitly

'contends that an educational policy

1

decision. whether or not to have buffer
days. should be dictated by the con
straints of the present dates or vaca-
tion Clearly. this argument constitutes
a warped ordering oi priorities. The
dates of school vacations should be
designed to ensure that Grinnell Offers
the best education pOSSIble. With the ex,
ception of Christmas break. none of Mr.
Walker's limitations should be regards
ed as sacrosanct dictums etched in
stone. it is implausible that another.
more acceptable calendar cannot be

devised, All that is required is a more
approprite ordering ol priorities. The
status oi the calendar is an issue oi cen
tral importance to the students. l urge
all students to actively express their op»
p ution to the facility's recent decision.

open Letter to
the Faculty:

Through my involvement in SGA and
through working with administrators
and iaculty members on a number oi
campus issues. most oi them academic
In nature. I have become sensitive to
the {act that many academic changes
which the students are pursuing have
already been discussed or tried in the
past. Although i respect the experience
behind the administrators and the
laculty's opinions/conclusions. 1 do not
believe this to be adequate justification
lor the suspension oi present and iuture
investigations. in this letter I will ad-
dress some oi the arguments I have en
countered throughout the year against
l'etnstltuting bui‘l'er days. and also sug-
gest possible alterations to the calen-
dar.

At last Monday's iaculty meeting. the
Curriculum Committee recommended
to the faculty that the Committee on
Academic standing appoint a subcom-
mittee on the academic calendar to
review the eilect ol' the present calen~
(lar on final exams and buffer days.
Most of the faculty members present
supported the present calendar and
voted against a formal evaluation of its
effects on the students' education.
Although the motion did not suggest
that butler days is the only response to
the increased academic tension at the
end oi each semester. this possibility
received the most discussion, Perhaps
the Curriculum Committee’s
spokespeople at the iaculty meeting did
not make clear enough the ztctual pro.
blem they perceive vlith the present
calendar: the calendar is dictated by
technical restriction. nstead of reflecs
ting an education pol cy.

. Some proiessors consider academic
pressure desirable Recent question
iiaire results suggest that the level oi
pressure at Grinnell may in tact be
detrimental to students' education.
Both students and faculty members
rated the existing academic tension at
crime“ as slightly above moderate t5
and 4 respectivelv on a scale from 1 to

ii. I agree that a moderate level oi
stress motivates and enhances perforv
mance. However. too much pressure
may hurt both periormance and, more
importantly. the depth oi students‘
understanding, A quick. superficial
review of a course's material for the
final exam benefits no one. The value of
having iinal examinations is the pro-
cess of reviewing the material. In this
process assimilation actually takes
place. not during the exam. lithe extra
time for deeper study does not existt the
final exam is no more than another ocA
casion to assign a grade to each stu»
dent. Such linal exams serve no pur-
pose as iar as the student's real educa-
tion is concerned.

Final papers are also aiiected by
time pressures at the end oi ﬂ'ie
semester. In fact, extra time is even
more crucial when a writing project in
volves reading and synthesizing a
number of outside texts,

A buffer period prior to final exams
would greatly benefit the students'
education while having a nominaleﬂect
on iaculty research projects.'0ne or
two days less oi vacation would not al-
lect the progress of a proiessor's
research; faculty members oiten plan
such projects on a scale oi months or
years. On the other hand. these extra
days could make a huge difference in
the quality oi student papers, Since
most students have on the average 2
papers due at the end oi the semester
lsee article concerning buiier day ques
tmnnairel. such a buffer period would
beneiit a large number oi students.

Professors often Cltetileil" own educa
tional experiences when demeaning the
importance ol buffer days. Many facul-
ty members attended schools that did
not have buffer days and that had a
heavier work load than Gi'innell.
However. such comparisons do very lit
tie to strengthen the argument against
reducing the current stress level at
Gl'lnnell. The existence of inadequacies
that have plagued the educational
systems ior decades is not an argument
for maintaining these inadequacies.
Also. the social atmosphere audits
demands differ from decade to decade
'and with them. young people‘s role in
their community. Such diiierences
render comparisons between Grinnell
College students today and college
students 10. 20 or 30 years ago almost ire
relevant.

Many alternatives to the present
academic calendar exist. one option
would be to start the fall semester on a
Tuesday or Wednesday (the first two
days are already Thursday and Friday
and make up ior the long Thanksgiving
Vt eekendl. If the last Thursday and Fris
day were buiier days, the last Tuesday
and Wednesday could be used to make
