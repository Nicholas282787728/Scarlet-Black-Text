Enioy the beauty and the wonder of the snow

by Howard B. Horn

Gl-innell College attempts to pru-
mote diversity. This means that people
from all over the United States and the
world congregate in this small town in
Iowa. For many of these students, this
is the first time they have spent a winter
this far north.

To these people, I‘d like to intro-
duce you to a strange little beast that
pokes its head out in the north around
this time of yearisnow.

For those of you who don’t know

already, the white stuff that fell from

cars and people lose Lheir traction, tn
orderlocombatthisphenomena,people
have been known to sprinkle salt or
sand on the snow. Also, people use
shovels, snow blowers (a device that
sueks up snow and blows itelsewhere),
and snow plows (a truck with a large
shovel in the front and a yellow Wam-
ing light on top) to move snow from an
oblrusivaplace to an unobtrusive place.

Once snow is safely out or your
way, it can be a beautiful thing. The
overabundance of white breaks up the
monotonyorbairentrcesanddeadgrass.
As a matter of fact, favorite Christmas
jinglessuch as“LetitSnow"and“White
Christmas” were written about snow.
Unfortunately, no Hanukah (or
Chanukah) song comes to mind about
snow. Maybe someone should write
one. Maybe not.

Snow has a tendency to end tlte
summer outdoor sports season. For
some people, the thought of playing

basketball in the snow is unappealing.
This may be due to Lhe fact that baskets
balls lend not to bounce very well on
snow. Engineeringmajors may want to
test this out for themselves.

Winter has its own set of games.
One of Lhe most popular or these is an
activity known as a snowball ﬁght. In
this activity, people throw ballsorsnow
at each other until they thoroughly an-
ger each other and list start ﬂying in
stead of snowballs. Another favorite
winter activity is skiing. One type or
skiing is downhill skiing. in this activ-

ity people strap long, thin rods to their
feet andslid down a hill until Lheyreach
the bottom or break an ankle, which
ever comes ﬁrst.

There is a certain attire that is
appropriate torsnow. Contrary topopu.
lar bumper stickers and beer ads, skiing
nakcd, or even partially naked, is not
advisable. It is also not advisable to
tread through the while stuff in shorts
and Birkenstocks, as one student from
Arizona has recently done. Instead, it
wouldbeadvisable to wearbuots. Once
you gainexperience with snow, regular
closed shoes can be used.

Sonow that you ’re prepared for it,
enjoy the snow. Make a snowperson (a
crude human sculpture made or snow).
Or gotobogganing (slide downahill on
a huge plastic or metal disc). Bill you
better hurry. By March or April all the
snow will be gone.

Bill killed

by Tum Ziabinger

There once was aman named Bill.
He led a simple life. He read his news-
paper. He walkedhisdog. Hedrankhis
coffee. And he loved his plants.

One day Bill realized: “I have no
meaningll" Sohelerthiseonriyhome,
his dog, his plants, his newspaper, and
his coffee to pursue a higher form of
existence.

On his way to a better life, he met
a poet. "Where are you going77" the
poet asked. "I am on my way to abetter
life," answered Bill. "Where do you
expect to ﬁnd it?" the poet questioned.
"I will find it out here in Lhe great wide
open,“ stated Bill.

Bill Continued his quest. With a
drive lhalcuuld not be stopped, he went
out far beyond the edge ofltis world to
touch a higher existence.

Unfortunately the sunofBlll‘sunir
verse exploded. He died. The poet
died. The plants and dog died. And
Bill‘shouse and newspaper were incin.

Bill's pursuit of happiness will
never be complete and ltis legacy will
never be known. 50 why am l telling
you this?? Because, trBilldtdnotlcave
