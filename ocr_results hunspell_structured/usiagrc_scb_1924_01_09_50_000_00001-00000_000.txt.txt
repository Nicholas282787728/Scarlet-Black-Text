The four teams have not been
definitely selected, as yet; but two
\affil'nlative and two negative trios

Mr. Hurshhargel‘. As Hawk may not

able to participate, two of th enew
men will he alternated in the different
contests, that all may have the ad—
vantage of varsity experience. Neither
Clovis nor Harnagel, veteran varsity
men, are debating this year.

debates, held shortly before Christmas

Eight of these men, Bender, Hawk,
McGee, Porter, Reynolds, Talbott,
Wear-in, and Wood, have had pl'evic
ous varsity experience; while the re-
mainder are novices at inter-collegiate
debating. However, the new men
proved their fitness for varsity com-
petition in the intersociety debates,
and strong teams are expected to be
formed“

Five Debates Scheduled

Five debates have. been scheduled
thus far, according to Mr. Harshbac
burger. A return debate will be held
with the state university Thursday,
February 14, at which time a Grinnell

open forum type, as was that held with
lowrr here a few weeks ago.

Friday, March it], a Grinnell af—
fil‘mative team will clash here with a
negative team from Beloit, while at
the same time a Grinnell negative
team will meet a Knox affirmative
team at Knox. Dual meets with Ame
es and Ode have been scheduled, but
the definite dates of thcsc tilts have not
as yet bcen determined. The qucs-
tion to be debated in each of the
contests is the same as that argued
in the intersucicty debates: “Resolc
Ved: That the United States should
enter the World Court under the cone
ditions proposed by President Hardc
ing.”

last night four varsity men dined
with the Grinnell Brotherhood, altcr
which they gave on inlormal discus-
sion of the question, Hicks and Moe

In a letter to the Lecture course
committee, Mr. Maurice Block, direc-
tor of the Omaha Society of Fine Arts,
said: "Mr. Pitch gave a lecture before
our society in the spring and deﬁnitely
tstablisllcd himself as a big and seri4
ous thinker an the subject. His lec-
tures are scholarly and interesting. He
is no radical. He made so profound all

members requested that We have him
again for a series of lectures this
year.”

The popularity of Mr. Pﬂcll has been
further demonstrated by the eagerness
with which other cities have seized
upon the opportunity to obtain his ser-
vices. Denver immediately signed up
for ﬁve lectures, Kansas City lfor Your.
Omaha for three, Wichita for one and
Grinnell for one.

Giving to the brevity of Mr. Pach’s
Western tour, it is doubtful if he will
be able to extend his lectures to any
other mid-Western cities and Grinnell
can count itself lucky to be included

Iin his rather abbreviated itinerary.

AS DATE or STAGING

DifficultiES of Producing the Otis
Skinner Play Do Not Deter
Societies.

For their biennial play, to be pre—
sented this year tile evening of Fell.
15, Chrcsto—Ellis literary societies
have selected “Mister Antonio“ by
Booth Tarkington.

"Mister Antonio" will be remember-
ed as the play which toured the
country so successfully with otis
Skinner starring in the title role. Like
lunch of Booth Tarkington's material,
the scene is laid in a small Middle
Western tow . The unusual feature
of “Mister Antonio" is tlle introduct-
ion oi the foreign element in the per--
son of on ltaliun organ grinder.

m icult to stage

This is an unusually difficult play
to produce, both as to staging and
casting. A bar—room scene. a corn-
plicuted and practical exterior set, a
live donkey tame enough to stand on
the stage through three solid acts,
repeated pistol shots, and a barrel 0l'<
gun competent to play both jazz and
iiyniris are among the stage require-
ments. The cast is also difficult to
adjust since it includes but three
“straight" roles. For the majority of
parts charaotur interpretations are
necessary.

Casting for "Mister Antonio" bee
gins this otter-noon when tryouts for
men's parts will be held in Aegisdod
ran hall. in this play the leading
roles are handled by men, a novel
feature in Crinncll aromatics. Try-
outs lor women's parts will be held
Thursday or Friday; and rehearsals
will begin as soon as the cast is com—
pletcd.

The joint cominlttcc responsible for
the play consists of Margaret Henely,
Winifred Parker, Junior Wood, and
Mark Entorf. Laban Fleak will act
as business manager.

par-ts, the first including two selec-
tions by the Club, quartet numbers,
bal’llonc and violin solos. The sec-
ond part consisted of five southern

as the most pleasing feature of the
Program. Violin duets by Godard
were a novel addition to the last part
of the program which also included
two college songs. The "Morning
Hymn" by Hensohcl, which is the
Intercollegiate Clcc club prize song,
was also featured in the program.

Financially the tollr was a success
according to the business manager,
Earl Burch. In most of the cities
