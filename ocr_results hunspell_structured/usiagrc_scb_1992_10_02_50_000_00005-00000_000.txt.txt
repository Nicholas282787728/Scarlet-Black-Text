Students attend Harvest Fest

The
sixties
are not
over

It is a lie to say that drugs are
not a part of our daily lives, We
all have our poisons, caffeine,
nicotine, alcohol, sugar, mari-
juana, LS D, chocolate, whatever.
But the fact remains that almost
everyone uses at leastone drug in
some form. There is no “Drug-
Free America" There never will
be. Drugs are an integral pan of
our lives and a part of almost
every society on the planet.

Butthere are laws governing
these drugs and an individual’s
use of the drugs To buy ciga-
rettes, you have to be 18 or older.
You have to be at least 21 to
consumealcohol. And thereis no
legal age to smoke marijuana or
lake LSD.

Last weekend, four other
Grinnell students and I went to
Madison to attend the Great Mid-
west Marijuana Harvest Festival
better known as Harvest Fest. We
were just five of over 4,000 people who trekked out to Harvest Fest to express our ideas about not only marijuana
laws, butbasically all laws governing drug use.

The protesters and gatherers were teenage deadheads, college kids, many long-haired adults, seveial bikers,
and a lot ofjust freaky people, To an outsider, seeing this parade ofpeople marching down to the Capitol Building
might feel like a time warp back to the sixties. But it wasn't, It was 1992.

Mostpeople, when they think oflong»hair. beads, tierdyes, and marijuana, they think ofa Lime long gone. The
past. A time that once was and isn‘t now. But the ideas and attitudes of the sixties arc notjust a thing of the past.
The sixties are still going on. Freedom, libeny, and change are all issues that are still very important. And being
in Madison last Saturday, at HarvestFest, marching with4,000 people. it was juSlobViouSlhalWOOdSlDCk. hippies,
peace, love, and social consciousness are not things that should be left in the past but ideas and concepts that are
still pertinent to today's future.

Being at Grinnell College, we live in a very protected bubble. Even though we are exposed to many different
cultures and philosophies, it is all very controlled. Harvest Fest, in contrast, was nuts. Madison was chaos.

Sitting on the lawn of the Capitol Building. we all listened to speakers from NORML (National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws), CAN (Cannabis Action Now), EACH (Busrncss Alliance for Commerce in
Hemp), and grassroots parties from Wisconsin. Minnesota, and Iowa. a hand even played. and we had a chance to
meet and talk with a lot of“on" people. People who werejust full ofcrazy and whackedrout ideas about marijuana,
the government, and life. The police were very friendly, There were nine arrests for possession of marijuana, But
other than that, the massive audience stood true to the over 20 ycar tradition of peacefulness at Harvest Fest.

All that day, all over Madison, there were people. Wacky people. The stores and restaurants were full of the
visitors who came for Harvest Fest. Even after the events were over, the energy that had infected Madison was still
going strong.

I have been to several protests. I went to Washington DC two years ago to join in a rally for the legalization
of marijuana. But this day in Madison was different. The vibes were stronger. It was all simply an energizing
experience to be with so many different people.

Yes, the core of this event was the legalization of marijuana, but there was more to it than that. It was the sense
of people at work. These people were not running around down mazes that lead to nowhere. They were not acting
normal. And they were far from “doing the right thing." There was an unexplainable sense of freedom here.

The point is, I was tapping into something different. Something I knew existed but I did not experience
everyday. Whatever your view is on the legalization of marijuana. I think you could appreciate the freedom in
Madison on that day. People were speaking their minds about crazy illegal things. What a rush,

If you are intermixed in any of this stuff, there is a marijuana legalization group on campus. Students for the
Legalization of Hemp is an organimtion with the intent to provide a forum for discussion on dnig laws and
opportunities to gain access to drug—related information. If you are interested in jumping on the bus, simply tell
[SLH] on the VAX and you're on.

Freedom of speech is important No one anywhere should be biting their tongue. The only way to keep these
ideas of freedom and liberty going is to keep them alive. Madison and Harvest Fest are proof enough that this all
can go on and is going on right now. Freedom is essential. Don’t lose it in anything you do.

 

It's not just for paper, fuel, and fiber anymore!

Legalize pot?

by Rebeka Meyer

 

We stood on the sidewalk as we watched over four thousand people
parade down Main Street in downtown Madison. I have seen a variety of
protesters ﬁle down this street before but it had never been like this,
Congregated together last Saturday were multitudes of pot smokers from
across the country coming together to share openly their use of marijuana at
the Great Midwest l-larvestFest. To the non-pot smoker this eventprobably
doesn’t sound all that impressive, In fact, one would probably envision a
bunch of wigged»outex-hippics trying to retrievesomethin g lost back in the
19605. But seeing pot smokers openly admitting they enjoyed the drug was
really quite amazing.

The crowd consisted of people from around the ages seventeen to about
thirty. There was a wide mix of people, predominately liberal looking
college students, and biker/black leather types as well as a bunch of people
who looked like they were searching for places to go with Jerry Garcia still
at home ill in bed.

The energy from thecrowd was intense. I was hesitant at firsttojoin the
crowd, because I was (and still am) undecided aboutmy beliefs on theactual
legalization of marijuana. So, why did I travel over three hundred miles to
see this bizarre event? The number one reason I went was to experience it.
not to smoke pot. In fact, I didn’t smoke pot at all that weekend, I went to
see the attitudes of the people there and see what they really had to say,

A lot of itI didn‘t agree with. One speaker preached that cannabis can
be used as a cure for AIDS. Another one preached that the US economy
could be brought out of debt by the development of various hemp industries
Both ofthese were going a bittoo far. Both ideas seem to stem out ofa large
mass of far—fetched propaganda that I’d prefer to avoid entirely.

The important point that was made (by a politician from Kentucky,
wearing a one-hundred percent hemp fabric suit) was that legalizing
marijuana will separate marijuana from hard-core, highly addictive dnigs
such as heroin. cocaine and crack. Marijuana does not have the physiologi<
cal addiction that even legal drugs such as alcohol or cigarettes have
Marijuana does not promote violence or cause the multitude of deaths that
alcoholdoes, If a gentle drug likemarijuanais illegal and grouped withmuch
more destructive drugs, why then is alcohol not also illegal?

Obviously I’m not for prohibition, but if alcohol is legal. why is
marijuana illegal? This seems quite hypocritical.

I still am a bit indecisive about the actual legalization of pDL I still
question whether introducing marijuana into mainstream society is going to
do anything more then introduce a lot more naive, irresponsible people to a
new drug that they would have normally not been exposed to,

I am still all for the spirit of marijuana whether legal or not. I believe
that marijuana can be a relatively safe way of exploring oneself and others,
whileinspiring creativity and insightandgivingpeopleanewway oflooking
at the world. I do however believe that when diving into the exploration of
marijuana, it is important for the individual to maintain a faith in their own
natural methods of exploration. The spirit I felt at Harvest Fest was
extremely positive. It would be fantastic, with or withoutthe legalization of
marijuana, if these sort of attitudes could transcend into every day life.
