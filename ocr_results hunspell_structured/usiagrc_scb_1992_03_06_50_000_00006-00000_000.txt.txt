By Jessica Stretton

Robens Theatre. The program will
consistofelevenmodem dance pieces
performed to a wide variety of both
poetry and music. Two poetry pieces

New Age,andclassica1 music will be

Face,” will be both written and cho-
reographed by Grinnell junior Alisa

Brickey.

Heidi Bakken,Kara Bakken, Eliza-
beth Benskin, Daphne Orlando, and

Shayma Saiyid will be the other stu7

There will be no one theme to the
performance; rather, it will be a
product of the entire group. The pro
gram will cover a broad spectrum of
themes, such as comic, lyric,
minarnalist, political and feminist.
Voertman says the performance will
be a “strongly choreographed, sensi-
tive work, on the pan of the choreoga
raphers as well as the dancers.”

Tryouts for the Dance Troupe are
held in the fall of each year, and the
Troupe practices four times a week.
from 4:30 to 6:00 pm. Voertman
describes the members oftho Troupe
as dancers who “work intimately,“
and put intensive time and energy
into their dancing.

mal winter performance in Decem-
ber in Nonh Lounge, and an outdoor
spring performance in Barber Plaza.

Angel Heart
Director Alan Parker (Pink Floyd: The Wall) twisLs theproverbial 1950‘s gumshoe wilh the grotesque in this
eerie movie based upon William l—ljortsberg’s novel, Fallen Angel. Detective Harry Angcl tracks an old
client's acquaintance, leading him into the sultry Crescent City of New Orleans, the voodoo tradition, and a
string of unexplained mysteries. Not surprisingly, considering the pcrenially controversial castrrMickcy

Ballad of a Soldier

A Soviet soldier on a furlow during World War II assrsts a numberofpeoplc as he makes his way homeward.
He also meets and falls in love with a charming girl. The film is involving, and we, the viewers, come to care
about them both. The soldier's furlow goes by rapidly, and the day comes when he must relum to the front

Western Front. Ballad ofa Soldier will be shown on Wednesday at 9:30 pm. in North Lounge.

The Birds

This 1963 Hitchcock classic is a study in special effects. It has little discernible mystery tn it (Hitch’s usual
specialty), but it makes up in suspense what it lacks in plot. Tippi Hedren and Cor’s acting is pretty minimal
here, but the movie is worth seeing if for no other reason than to scare yourself silly before mid»semsl l! The
Bird: will be shown on Saturday at 9:00 pm, in North Lounge.

Defending Your Life

Calligraphy at Community Center

By Jennifer Stukas

UntilMarch13,theGrinnellCom-
munity Art Gallery (on the second
ﬂoor of the Community Center lo
cated at 4th and Broad Street) will be
hosting an exhibit of 27 of the best
works of two calligraphy guilds: the
QuadCityCalligraphers’Guild,bascd
in Davenport, and the Iowa Scribes,
based in Cedar Rapids

The pieces range from those in
which the chosen quote or poem is as

important as thecomposition--for ex-
ample, “Behold,” a quote from the
Messiah, done in black on Fabriano
and Tuxedo paper by Peg Carlton
Van Nest-- to those that are far more
compositional than legiblew for in»
stance, one of three gold medal win-
ners, “I Will Shake the Heavens,"
also by Van Nest.

In subject matter also, there is a
large variety. While many artists
quoted greats like Shakespeare and
Thoreau, Fran Young chose to create

the shape of a rooster from hundreds
of short phmes about chickens, and
teacher Paul l-Ien'era simply inscribed
the word “Peace” in gold leaf on
slate.

Although the artists sampled rep
resent many levels of experience, all
are quite competent and their work is
well wonh seeing. The Community
Gallery is open weekdays from 12:00
toA:00 pm, as well as the evenings
of March 2 and March 11 from 6:30
to 8:30 pm. Admission is free.
