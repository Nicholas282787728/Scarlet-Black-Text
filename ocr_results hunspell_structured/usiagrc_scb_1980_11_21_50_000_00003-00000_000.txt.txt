Tederman clarifies HC

by Anne Rowland

The confusion and contradictions
over the proposed relocation of the
Health Center to Grinnell General
Hospital arose in the past two weeks
because Vice-President and Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Tederman was
"out of town" and, therefore,
unavailable for comment,

Both Tederman and Executive Vice-
President of the college Wally Walker
agree that Tederman knows the most
about the plans so far. “I conceived oi
this notion last year and spoke to Dr,
Paulson about it," said Tedern-ian,
"But a new administrator of the
hospital came and we wanted him to get
settled in first.”

It's Pamela Shatzer, fire prevention in
spector, from the State Fire Marshall's
office in Des Momes, that's who

Although Grinnell hasn't had a com»
prehensive fire safety examination in
at least five years, Fire Prevention
Supervisor Robert Leber said in an in-
terView last week, "1 don‘t anticxpate
finding any big problems. our ex
periences with other campuses show we
haven't found large or serious violav
tions," Results of the inspection should
be ready by mid to late December.

The Fire Marshall's office plans,
along with members of the administra
tion, to systematically examine all of
the buildings on campus, including the
resxdence halls. But, he stressed, “We
seldom go into all resident rooms,”
because most [If the pertinent informa-
tion can be observed from the hallways
or outdoors. “We're only interested in
fire safety." he commented. “If
students are committing a hazardous
act, such as smoking marijuana, it’s

«none of our business.

However, Leber did warn that the [ire
marshalls have an "Open warrant” to
enter 'studenl living quarters. "The
24-hour notice is an agreement between
the college and the student body," he
said. "We don't have to subscribe to it ”

One of the reasons Leber expects to
find few violations stems from nature of
the dorm renovation program. "The
current remodeling has been done on a
job to job inspection basis.” said Leber,
Consequently he must visit fewer
residence halls.

Results of the inspection are expected
to be ready by late December.

the hospital would be interested in such
a merger. Faas recently took the idea
to the hospital Board of Trustees who
”agreed in principle," said Tedermari.
“I then decided to go public to tell the
campus about the idea," he said.

Tederman explained that he waited
to announce the idea until “there was
something to say." He stressed, “I
didn’t want to get into contract negotia-
tions until the campus knew." Tederr
man noted, “The reason i got inlo this
at all is that from when I first got to the
college, I met with requests and even
demands to improve the health care
facilities." Tederman came to Grinnell
12 years ago,

”It doesn't surprise me a bit that

students are fearful,” said Tederman.
”I think some of the questions are quite
legitimate.” In fact, he said he “went
public" because, “I wanted to know the
campus reaction for and against.
“Also,“ he added. “I wanted to find out
what minimal care the campus would
accept.” .

By the beginning of next week, Teder»
man hopes to have a memo out to
students explaining his position, “what
it is we’re doing and why." He also
stated, “I’d like to have an open forum
as soon as we get a little further in
knowing what He hospital is willing or
unwilling to do."

Tedei-rnan expects the hospital to pre»
sent a list of services they would be will-
ing to provide widiin a few weeks.
