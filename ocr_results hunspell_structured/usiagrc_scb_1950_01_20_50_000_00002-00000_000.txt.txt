All for All-"A Challenge

We, the students of Grinnell College, are about to face
a serious challenge, one that we can‘t afford to turn our
backs upon, one which, for our own good, must be met
squarelyl ‘

It is not an unusual challenge in one sense, merely the
traumatic twice-yearly event called “exam time.” But it
would seem that at tllis time there is something more at,
stake than the final push, the grades, and a rest. We are:
face to face with lthe opportunity for showing the powers
that be that we are ready for a comprehensive academic
system at Grinnell College

As we have been reporting periodically, such a system
is in tlle offing, the grist is in the mill, the mill is gristing.
Our greysbearded mentors are in the process of carefully
nosing through the system as created by the Student Couns
cil committee. We, at exam time next week, will have the
opportunity to Sholv' our stuff, as it were, to prove our
worth by demonstrating a thoroughly adult attitude toward
examinations and the taking technique thereof.

We consider it less than useless to preach on the sub—
ject of honesty and morality. Our only grounds for com-
ment lie in emphasizing the idea of the good of all versus
the good of one. If one ,strays and gets caught, it is not
only his neck but, in a sense, the necks of all in that it
will be a serious cut into the chances of our pet flower, the
honor system, blossoming in the near future The seed has
been planted; let’s give the little rascal a change to grow.
