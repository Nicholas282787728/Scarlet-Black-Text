it appears to us that under the
present system the men have all the
best at the bargain. A girl, perforce,
must more or less passively await the
will and pleasure or the men. Anti
even then, when her buzzer rings she
has little assurance that the man on
the other end ot the”wire will be
among those on her list‘of dosh-ables.

We do not wish to intimate for a
moment that girls have no power to
regulate their date schedules. Thach-
eray has sagsly remarked that "A we—
man with fair opportunities. and with-
out an absolute hump, my marry
whom she likes." Lethe roan believe
them helpless creatures!

But everything considered we are.
nevertheless of the opinion that the
men are ravored. A man has the
privilege ol running over his various
acquaintances among the ladies until
a suitable name is reached. If he
doesn't know the one with whom he
wishes to have a date he does not have
to look far for a trusty brother who

to light his pipe, put his feet on the
nearest article of furniture and settle
down to a quiet evening at home.

-We accept. the statement which has
been heretofore made in regard to the
matter that this is leap year It has
also been further suggested that leap
year comes but once in every college
generation.

The part which politics should play
in the student lite at a college is a
question worthy cl consideration.

By politics we mean the contests or
various groups ror power in the or-
ganized student lite.

on a. question demanding consideration
by any large number there will be iew
times when all will think alike. Opin-

It. can hardly be denied that compe—

alive interest. Republicans and oth—
ers have loudly condemned the degen—

turn to the old competitive system of
private ownership.

Interest on the part of voters is an
important step toward good govern—

wide-awake electorate a minority has
