SORRY, OUR ERROR

Ralph Polnerenk, director or
college services, caught a
large typographical error in
the article “Tuition
examined," published last
week. Grinnell’s $350 increase
will bring in about $004,000
additional revenue, and not
$64,000.

Pomerenk was especially
concerned, however, about
editorial error which stated
that the board increase would
supplement faculty salaries.
The statement faculty salaries,
and that the $35 hoard increase
would be used exclusively to
balance rising cost Costs in the
dining rooms and kitchens,
