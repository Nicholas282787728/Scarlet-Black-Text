Praise Requil‘es Dramatic Club
for Essaying Real Tragedy

L

I A notable success was achieved by
the bromide club in the recent pew
lorrnance before a large audience at
tho Gr-innell high heel auditorium of
Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet,"
Tlrc rnerube . or the cast and Airs, liai-
lrc F. Flanagan, the director, clearly
demonstrated that Shakespearean
tragedy is not beyond the scope or
amateur actors who approach the task
in a mood of high seriousness and
wrtir a willingness to work.

The staging was adequate in con-
ceptrou and in execution. Simple set-
tings were used to suggest the primer:
ous changes of scene without making
necessary the long periods of waiting
tlirit min the erfectu‘eliess of most
Shakespearean productions en the
modern , are The lighting cilects
under- the direction of Howard wicks
were beautifully effective. The cos.
tiilllesithe same that had been used
h the Suthern—liarloe company *
“ere unusually happy in suggesting
the colorful grace of Renaissance
Italy.

In such a setting the acting or Miss
Winifred Parker as Jrrliet had an un—
usual opportunity of expression, Silli-
ply and directly it portrayed the devel—
opment of a child in the first act,
through the awakening of love, to the
lyrical heautyl of the first balcony
scene, to the intensity of the par-ting
at dawn, and to the quiet resolution of
the woman in the potion and the tomb
scenes. Juliet is a part so often played
by technically skilled actresses of too
evident maturity that it was a pleas~
live to see it presented with. the unso-
phisticated grace and simplicity of,
girlhood.

Miss Jessie Rogers as the Nurse
handled a difficult character part with
a skill that won the audience from the
first, iiiss Katherine Gilmore played
the part of Lady Capulet with dignity
and pulse.

Robert Berry appeared as Romeo,
and illustrated anew the old proverb
that all the world loves a lover. He
was the natural center of a splendid
group of gay, careless young men,
scorinfui of‘controi, hotly loving and
joyously hating, eager to quarrel and
Quick to draw steel whenever the cube
bled streets of Verona rang to the ac~
companiment of “the immortal passa-
do," and “the photo reversu.” Hana
tlrorne Arey made an ideal Beuvolio,
and Bernard Craven added one more
achievement to his long dramatic rec
ord in the character of Mercutio. Cole
Van Cor-den gave a spi ted impersolh
atrou of the bully, Tyhalt; and Ralph

lliy Prof Paul Sperrccr- Wood)

l'lrlil pl
tlieLl Ell ).

William wood Jr. as Friar Law
relicc was a success. Indeed to merr-
tron all those per-sons deser-vrnc of
recognition would be to include the
whole cast and the staff, not forget-
ting the doublet and hose clad Tudor-
pages who acted as rrshe

Flaws in the production were few,
and were generally the result of the
alteration of the original play to suit
the modern stage, The appearance of
Peter in the lust scene in place of
Sampson was something of a shock.
Peter is di inctly a comic character,
and hi presence in this scene detracts
from its value as serious preparation
for the coming traged. Again, Just
before the curtain fell at the end of
the third scene of the second act, R0»
rnco and Juliet dropped on their knees
before Friar Lawrence in an attitude
obviously intended to suggest the he-
ginuing oi the marriage ceremony.
shak ear-e clearly intended that the
wedding should take place off stage
in the Irlfir's orator-y or chapel, the
natural place for its celebration,

The duel scene in the second act of
the modernized version is in “A Vera
una public place.” We may suppose
that Verona public places are equipped
with tables and Chairs for the conve-
nience of drinker-s. But even in Ver—
oua it is hardly customary to drink
wine from beer steins or to refill them
from another stein of the sanre si ..
Perhaps under the Volstead not all
things become possible. However, the
text of Shakespeare indicates nothing
more than a meeting in the street,

After all, such matters are of rela-
tive insignificance. The play‘s the
thing, and this particular play was
successful as a whole, The close at-
tention of the audience, the unflagging
interest and especially the moment of
hushed suspense at the culmination of
the tragedy, these things attest the
'lact of success, indubitable. They
show that the fortunes of the “st'
crossed lovers" had in the “two hours'
traffic of our stage" become the vital
concern of the whole audience. Such
a reception is the final justification
for staff, cast, and director of the .-
long and sever-e labors of preparation,

The production of Shakespeare ham
ing been thus undertaken under the
most favorable auspices, it is to be
hoped that the Dramatic club may see
its way clear to continue the practi s
in future years. A revival of the clno~
sics should be an annual crrstorn at
Grinnell.

Tire trustees of Vassar college halie
Hallie F, Flanagan, [qr
the past three years a member of the
Griuueii faculty, to be associate pro-
fessor of English at Vassar beginning
next September.

Pi'oiessor Flanagan's speciality is
dramatic production, and she is to
organize and develop play-production
and play writing at Vassar in connec-
tion with the department of English.

Mrs. Flanagan graduated at Grin-
neii In 1911 and has had graduate
work in stage-directing with Irving
Pichei or Chicago, and in playewrit»
ing and playrpl'oduction with Alexand-
er Dean of‘ Chicago and Prof.
George P. Baker at Harvard, with
whom she did special work last year,
acting as his assistant in the famous
“~17" workshop, and receiving the de-
gree of master of arts at Harvard
In June, 1994. Prior to her becoming
a member of the faculty of Grinneli,
Mrs. Flanagan gave instruction in dra-
ma at Colorado Springs School of Ex
pl'esslon.

At Griuneli her most significant
work has been in the development of
the experimental theatre and encour-
aging co-operatroil between the Drug
irratic club and iler classes in play
production of such works as "Romeo
and Juliet," Rostiind’s “lies Romanes-
qlles," and Philip Barry “You and 1.”

Mrs, Flanagan has signed a col-re
tract at Vassar only for one year and
her departure from Gr-inucil is no:
irrevocable, she looks upon it I'iltll ,
(is an extended post graduate study iu

future of the drama is iir the Middle

"he outdoor track season was of~
rlly opened for the Pioneers this
afternoon when the annual home meet
was run off on Ward field. It was
the first at eight meets which will
keep Coach H. J. Hlii'l's men in cour-
pctrtion every neck and for the rest
of the sclrol year.

A dual has been scheduled
Nebraska to be held at Lincoln May-

The Coi'nhllskel's have won the
Missouri Valle outdoor meet for four
year-s in succcs on and they will
probably frrrnrsh the Pioneers the
stiffest opposition of the year. Ne—
braska and Grmnell clashed on the
cinder path in a dual nreet several
years ago so this year's encounter will
be but a renewal of track relations
with the Coi‘nhuskers.

Most of the squad have been working
out through vacation in preparation
for the Kansas relays next Saturday.
The team to make the trip has not
been pickedi but it is expected that two
or three quartets will wear the Malv
tese cross in the big relay carnival.
The mile relay team promises to be
especially strong with Taylor, Kitchen,
M, Jones, Scharnweher and Stutts
fighting for positions as baton cer—
riers.

The home meet which was doped as
an easy victory for the seniors was
expected to give Coach Huff a good
line on his material tor the year. It
was also the first opportunity to see
the freshmen in competition and there
is always considerable inter-est at—
tached to the performance of the year-
linss. Of this year's prep squad Lustr
field, pole vaulter and Hiies, sprinter
seem to be the most promising.

Tonight,

with

Frank Speight, the English Dickens
actor, who apears in Herrick chapel
tbrs evening, is a singularly modest
man for an artist. lie seems to have
no temperament, and no temper. He
is an optimist.

It is something to hold a vast crorvd
lov two solid hours without any make-
rrp, properties or scenery, withorrt any
supporting company. Mr. Sneaight
plays every part, and, so keen are his
char-arter- change that he never says,
“then ilr. Pickwick suit Mr. Pick-
uick, round and Jolly, ur’ cs some-
where frorrr within in. Spearght and

denly there and is talking. Then
he vanishcs to give in the other part-
ner to the dialogue. In his New York
program rlv Spcawht portrayed, xLy»
live diifer-ent character-s.

Few, people grvo ,llr-. Speaight cred~
it for berug a dramatist. \They think
the work rs Drckcns a- d Dickens gets
the credit for the lines. But Dickens
takes weeks to read and Mr. Seaight
gives all of the greater books in two
hours, it took in ma year and a half
to cut “lhckwick Papers” so that he
could present it in two hours, and he
had to dramatize much of it. Any one
reading Dickens aloud will find that.
Mr. Spotlight has worked marvels. The
descriptions he acts; implied business
he has created; big moments he has
had to rewrite into the fir-st per-sou.
Back of the entertainment he gives
is years of hard work, of uuceasing
cutting and drauratrzrug.
