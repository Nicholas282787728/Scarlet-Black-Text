Alumnus Tells Fun
of Prowling in Odd

K

The Scarlet and Black reporter
who recently wrote a special ai l~
elo oii odd nooks and col'nels on
the campus is not the only Giin-
nellian who has pi-owled hither

new rope on the classic bell,” he
continues,

“that there is an iron-doored vault
in the library, where some years
ago there were stored important
documents along with numerous
boxes of miscellaneous ancient
coins? Can you imagine what
fun it is to dust off the rafters
in the chapel? Do you know how
easy it is to climb over the iron
fences between the cottages?"

“And it you want to see some-
thing medieval»like.” urges Miller,

that rises three floors from. the
ground along the entrance doors

The recent fire at Brown univer»
sity destroyed the notes William
L. Kubie was going to use in writ
ing his senior thesis. He had spent
a year in gathering the material.
