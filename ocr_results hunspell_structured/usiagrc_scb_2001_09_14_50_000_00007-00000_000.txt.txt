Grinnell College’s community garden is mnlriporpose One

brought up rhe poinr rhar sinoe “lanoFiowa's ropsorl is noiv in

The garden also seems ro he a powerful real for improving
Town-gown relarions. Turner nored me: he lies gotten ro know a

enjoyed doing so. Talklng ahaur farming and sharing informa-
non,Trrmer said, is nor only useful, but “ir serves as a good way ro
develop eommonsliry" herween srndenrs and loeal farmers, rwo
groups which erren assume rhar rhcy do nor share anything wrrh
rho orher. After visiting {armors markers across rhe sraro, Tnmer
believes that rhe farm eommnnlry in Grinncll is one ofriic mosr
