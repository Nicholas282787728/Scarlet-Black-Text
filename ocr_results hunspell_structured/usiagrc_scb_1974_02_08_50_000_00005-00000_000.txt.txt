Drinking Woes

f The last two months have been bad for Iowa’s liquor
consumers, People who ent to the neighborhood tavern
to iorget the energy cri is and spiraling innation were
greeted by a Scotch whiskey shortage and skyrocketing
prices,

It began in early December with a crackdown on Iowans
who buy liquor in neighboring lllinois. Iowa law iorbids
imports of more than one quart of liquor per person per
trip, and agents of the Iowa Beer and Liquor Control Com-
mission, Working in teams in the Quad Cities area, began a
concerted drive to enforce the law to the letter.

Citizens and legislators on both sides of the border pro»
tested. Illinois liquor store owners cried “harassment,”
and the Illinois attorney general promised to investigate
the possibility that the Iowa agents were guilty oi “en-
trapment.” _

But Illinois State Representative Ben Polk (ReMoline),
a native Iowan, says one group of ingenious Iowans got the
last laugh on the Iowa liquor agents, ,

He said they, went to an Illinois liquor store, where they
purchased several cases of salt drinks, which the store
packed in empty bourbon boxes. As they leit‘ the store,
they “Haunted” the box at the agents they knew were
watching.

AS they expected, the agents stopped them-as soon as
they crossed the border. A lot at soda pop was uncovw
ered, but the agents discovered that they had been taken
in by a practical joke.

Representative Thomas Higgins (R~Davenport) is intro»
ducing a bill in the current session of the legislature to
raise the import quota Irom one quart to 15 gallons.

Higgins called the wave‘ot liquor arrests “harassment”
-and Said that the State of Iowa must be willing to face out-
otestate competition in liquor sales.

Meanwhile, news of anotherproblem otlowaimbibersbegan
to spread, State Beer and Liquor Control Department Dire
ector Rolland Gallagher announced January 2 that 240,000
bottles of Scotch whiskey had been ordered to head offa
threatened shortage of the popular beverage,

Scotch, Gallagher explained, had always been difficult
to obtain, with deliveries normally taking ten weeks. But
Britain and Scotland are now facing a shortage of glass
bottles, in addition to the widely publicized energy crisis.
When experts predicted the shortage, Gallagher explained,
his department placed the large order, which he estimates

, will be a Six month supply for Iowa's 200 liquor stores,

Beer drinkers got bad news in mid—January. Following a
ruling by the Cost oi Living Council allowing wholesale
price increases ranging from 3.8 to 5 per cent for three
major brands, retail prices began to go up.

Retail prices in Des Moines rose about ten cents per
six-pack, and bottle prices in taverns were up abouta
nickel per bottle.

Prices in the College Pub skyrocketed from $1.25 to
$1.65 (or a pitcher of beer. Glasses of beer rose a nickel,
irom 30c to 359.

At .the Longhorn, Cashier Rhonda Wilson said Tuesday
that the price of a pitcher of beer Will rise 25c, and that
all drinks and beer will cost a nickel more.

At JD’S, Owner Bob Globus said that prices for his
drinks will go up, but the exact amounts have not yet
been determined.

Gross Will Retire

WASHINGTON, D.C,--U.S. Representative H. R. Gross
(R-la.) has announced that he will not seek rerelection.
Gross, 74, is in the final year of his thirteenth term in
the'House, where he has iorged a reputation lorinde»
pendence and tiscal responsibility.

Gross was noted for his efforts to block bills which he

, ielt wasted money. But his eiiorts were rarely partisan,
‘and he received a standing ovation when the House convened
January 21.

As soon as the cheers and speeches ended, Gross vulced
strong objections to considering two major spending bills
which were being presented to the House without committee
reports. It was considered typical oi his style.

Gross was a master oi parliamentary procedure, and used
it to block or delay bills he considered wasteful. One of
his tavorite procedures required filing or written notice
with the House clerk ., and Gross carries asupply of
typewritten forms with him at all times, SO that he can
invoke the procedure with a stroke at his pen in an emere
gency.

The veteran legislator, whD Started his careerasa sportsr
caster with Des Moines radio station WHO, says retiring
will give him more time to spend with his iam'ily.

With Gross’s seat up for grabs, at least ten Iowans
have either announced their candidacy or are seriously
considering entering the race.

Among those definitely seeking the Third District seat
is Nicholas Johnson, former Federal Communications

’ Commissioner. Johnson, a Democrat, made his announcer
.ment January 18, the same day Gross made his intentions
known. ‘

Weapons, Yes-Desks, No!

DES MOINES, IAquwa spends millions oi dollars each
year fighting crime but can’t ﬁnd the money to give agents
or the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) desks and
chairs, according to BCI Director Craig Beck.

I’The BCI’s latest rebutt came January 8, when the Iowa
crime Commission reiused Beek’s $8,950 requesttoroliice
furniture tor 13 BCI agents who work outside Des Moines.

Currently, agents outside Des Moines must scrounge
office space whereever they can tind it. men, the only
“office" they can iind is a phone booth, Beek's plan would
have involved purchasing desks and chairs tor each agent,
and placing them in extra space at Iowa Highway Patrol
district oitices throughout the state,

But the Commission, which voted to spent $7.3 million
in tederal anticrime tunds over the next year, vetoed
Beek's request at the same meeting.

Governor Borrows Orr Proposal

DES MOINES, IAs-Governor Robert Ray Surprised legle
slative observers January 15 when he called for the eli-
mlnation of the sales tax on land and prescription drugs.

Ray’s proposal came as part at the 13 point legislative
program he presented to a joint session of the Sixty-Fifth
General Assembly in his annual State of the State message.

Ray’s plan was virtually identical to one which has been
supported ior several years by State Senator Joan Orr
(D-Grinnell). Orr had lined up 23 Senate sponsors and
27 in the House when Ray made his announcement,

Orr said she was delighted that Ray had come out in favor
or her idea, despite the tact that he will get much or the
credit for the measure.

Ray’s tax proposal came as a surprise to observers, be
cause he has long opposed such plans. His decision to
support the tax cut apparently stems from the enormous
state budget surplus generated by record tax revenues.

His decision was a last minute one, At a news Conference
two Weeks prior to his appearance before the legislature,
Ray said, “I don’t think it’s likely" that a sales tax Cut
out would be proposed.

The measure has passed the Senate. but an alternative
measure in the House may delay linal legislative action,
‘ A House bill would keep the sales tax on food and preSr
cription drugs, but would reduce the overall rate tor all
taxable items from 3 per cent to Zrl/Z per cent

Both Ray and Orr oppose the House version.

RAY vs. ORR:

"Purse snatcher!"

Orr explained in a telephone interview Sunday that the
House proposal would primarily beneiit those making
large purchases in Iowa.

She added that support tor the 2—1/2 per cent sales tax
plan appeared to come, at least in part, Irom large {arm
operators who regularly make large equipment purchases.

other major points in Ray's legislative program include:

‘sstz, pay raises tor certain state employees

‘Buying more land to preserve open spaces and complete

state park projects

*Extending the lowa Educational Broadcasting Network

signal to unserved portions ot the state.

’Bullding 'two new state otiice buildings in Des Moines

*Setling a ceiling on revolving charge account interest

rates

‘Creating a state department oi transpomtion

*Establishing a state land use policy to preserve agri—

cultural lands

‘Enacting a no—tault auto insurance system that would

allow victims to be paid by their own insurance com-
panies regardless ct guilt, but Wauld preserve a vice
tim's rights to sue a defendant.

"Providing a public employee collective bargaining sys-

tem with a ”no strike” clause

"Allowlng licensed private iirms to sell liquor in towns

too small to support a state liquor store

‘Providing a delay in paying increased property taxes

resulting trom home improvements '

*Froviding tougher state salety laws lor elevators

Trucking Controversy Continues

DES MOINES, IA—»The controversy over whether lowa
should allow longer and heavier trucks is continuing in the
new session at the lowa Legislature.

The lowa House last year approved a measure to allow
65rfoot double-bottom trucks on Iowa highways, but the
senate has not yet acted: The measure is supported by
trucking and livestock interests, and is opposed by several
public interest groups, including the lowa Student Public
interest Research Group (lsleG),

Roger Hileman, executive director of the Iowa MotorTruck
Association, told state legislators in early January that the
nation is facing a “productivity Crisis,” and that tailure
to legalize longer trucks is aggravating that ”Crisis H

Hileman also told legislators that the association tavors
increasing the weight limits on trucks by 2,000 pounds,

Many legislators disagree with Hileman, who contends
that longer, heavier trucks would save fuel,

Andrew Varley (it-Stewart), speaker of the House, says he
doesn’t think bigger trucks will save tuel. instead, he be-

lieves "moving more products by rail is what really could
save fuel." I

Governor Robert Ray is a longtime opponent at larger
trucks. He indicated recently that, it trucklength and weight '
regulations were eased, many trucks which now bypass
lowa would instead travel lowa roads. This, he said, would
use up the limited amountOldieselfuelallooated to the State
on the basis or last year’s trafﬁc. a

The effect ot a report showing that 80 per cent of the tr-
ucks clocked in a July study were exceeding posted speed
limits are not yet clear.

The report, released January 22, was prepared by the
Iowa Highway Commission, It involved radar speed checks
of 2,296 trucks made at 25 locations on Iowa Interstates ,
and primary highways. ,

A spokesman tor Teamsters Local 1‘47 denied that truck-
ers were chronic Speeders, noting that less than one per
cent of that local’s members had been cited for speeding_
in the past year

The Highway Commission study also showed that 13 per «
cent of the 4,781 passenger Cars clocked on Iowa primary
highways were exceeding the posted speed limits.

Illegal Bowling

DES MOINES, lhnlowa legislators thought they were
arranging to allow church bingo when they passed a con-
troversial gambling law late in the last SESSIUIL

But, according to a verbal opinion issued January 16
by attorney General Richard Turner, the law actually
prohibits major golf and bowling tournaments.

Turner suggested that two amendments be addedtothe law.
The lirst would permit “Athletic contests, races,ortcur— ‘
naments or cooking, hobby, livestock, animal, or poultry
exhibitions” which require entry fees and otter cash prizes
as long as they were not conductedatcarnivals or midways.

The second amendment would allow what Turnerdescribed
as iriendly wagers among participants on athletic contests.

Violations oi the law are considered indictable misde—
meanors, carrying possible fines o1 $1,000 and possible ‘
jail terms at one year.

In issuing the opuiion, Turner, who was conﬁned bya
heart attack at the time the bill passed the legislature,

said he had tried to warn the lawmakers that the bill
was poorly written, I

The problem stems irom the lack of exemptions in the
bill. As currently written, the law prohibits any lourna~
ment or contest with an entry tee over $1, or which otters .
prizes worth more than $25.

Governor Robert Ray and legislative leaders promised
prompt action to eliminate the problem.

First Baby Headaches

Iowa’s traditional “lirst baby or the year” contests had
unexpected results in at least tour communities. The win-
ning babies were born to unwed mothers,

In vinton, ida Grove, and Ames, the local newspapers
sponsoring the contests awarded the prizes to the unwed.
mothers without serious reservations. otilcials at the Ida
Grove Pioneer—Record, however, say they will probably
change contest rules to prevent recurrences in the tuture.

But the situation in Iowa City got statewide attention when
the Iowa City PresseCitlzeh relused to declare Miss Pan-l-

i2???

Aubrecht, 18, the winner at the contest, although hers was
the lirst child born in Johnson County. ’

Aubrecht protested the decision, and a number or thedowa
City merchants who supplied contest prizes awarded dup-
licates, one prize to Aubrecht and one to the ottic‘ial
winner, Mrs. John Elder.

The story received national attention, and produced an-
other unexpected result, Tom R. Scott, a Midland, Tx
attorney, heard about the situation and sent Aubrecht
a $50 check, He explained that he thought she had gotten
a bum rap from contest officials.

One Campus For Sale or Lease

FAIRFIELD, IA--Parsons College died June 11, when the
99 year old institution was declared bankrupt.

With the death of the college, Falrfield found itself with
a massive dent in its economy and an empty campus that
once housed 5,000 students.

Using Federal Revenue Sharing funds and a $30,000 grant
from the Iowa Development Commission, the City of Fair»
field has commissioned a study to determine possible uses
tor the campus.

Two life insurance companies n Connecticut General and
Connecticut Mutual ,_ are the largest creditors of the de-
funct college. They are cooperating in the study, and con»
tributing $15,000 to help tinance it.

Officials hope the Study, to be conducted by the Midwest
Research Institute of Kansas City, MO, will not only pro-
vide answers for Fairlield but will produce information
applicable to other lowa towns which might lose private
colleges

The second purpose is significant in light of another
Midwest Research Institute study, released January 2,
which showed a projected decline of one-third in the en-
rollment at Iowa's private colleges.

Although educators would not comment on the ramiiica»
tions it the projections prove accurate, it is considered
likely that enrollment drops of this magnitude could prove
latal to some smaller lowa colleges,
