What is poverty, what does it look like?

Poverty means not being able to participate fully in so-
ciety, and that comes from not being able to have an ordi-
nary [life] where you can go without worrying about gel-
ting the essentials, and it also means you are not included
in the rest ofsoclety.

Whyis looking at poverty in the U.S. important?

Well, poverty is a relative experience, and in a country
as rich as ours to have kids dying because orlnck of dental
care drives me crazy,

What's the best action government can take to com—
bat poverty and do we have to be clear we are reducing
poverty?

I think iiyoi. can show that something you’ve done has
reduced poverty it can add support. In terms ofwhat is the
single most important thing for government to do, that's
tricky. I would say for those unable to work it ought to be
up to the government to provide the resources those people
need to be out otpoverty and it's shocking that we don't do
that. For people able to work we need to see wages contin~
us to grow and we need a proper steppingestone for wages
to increase. It ought to be a fundamental government prinr
ciple that anyone who works full time is not poor.

Atterlookirig at your research paper from 2003, I was
wondering if there is one take home message or some-
thing everyone should really consider when they read it?

I need to update it.l think 20 states, across the country,
have a state government that has really grabbed the bull
by the horn in deciding that they need to pay attention to
poverty and the lack of opportunity and to come up with
some ideas for how to address, and for this I am pumped.
It begins with a few small steps that can really make a big
difference.

You discuss having a ‘safety net,‘ what do you mean

‘anfv'éié V ’

5'.

by that?

We need to reconﬁgure our welfare policy, so that it is
really truly about getting people out of poverty and that
will entail creating specific rules and regulations for govr
ernment.

Given how many people are already at work, how do
you think we can alter income?

Well,l think raising wages is the hardest thing to ace
complish, so although we should revisit minimum wage we
need to provide inrwork beneﬁts like income tax credit,
child health credit and all the ones that were boosted by
the recovery act. Those are the tax income strategies that
need to be bolstered, I think in addition we need to en-
courage the whole education component, to not only build
skills but make sure children and adults are taken care of

so we can have a labor base that can tackle the kind ofjobs
we have.

One theory that is in respect to jobs, that the jobs in
the middle are disappearing, there is a cluster ofgrowth on
the low end and there will continue to be growth on the
high end.

How do you feel about the role ofunions to help come
bat the problems in the work force?

I am all for them, though 1 am not saying that all unions
are without ﬂaw. I do believe that unionization is a vital
tool for enhancing the possibility for wage increases.

Should we look at other countries for an example to
how to tackle poverty?

1 think it really valuable for the US to learn lessons
from state developments, which is what typically happens
here and particularly in the last decade. The federal gov
ernment has waited for the state to come up with ideas in
an array of areas. for example ifwe look at Massachusetts’
health care, and ifyou look at the minimum wage that only
happened because many states suggested it.

You discussed the fact that children raised in poor
families have signiﬁcantlysmaller vocabularies, and also
have several other developmental problems in their abil-
ity to learn, and the fact that as a society we will pay now
or later, can you explain this point to me again?

The fact that the stress ofliving in poverty changes how
the brain grows and it means that kids struggle to have a
working memory, by the time they're in elementary school
its no wonder they can't do those school books. Everybody
thinks that it is because they aren't practicing enough, or
their parents aren’t reading to them, and I’m sure that if
they read it would be better. The {act that stress causes syn-
apses not to happen, that’s a lot for a parent to overcome,
and that provides a cost to us as that kid may drop out of
school and don’t contribute to society.

We tend to leave a family in poverty, but then put the
kid in day care, but that's going to be expensive too. So why
not help the family through wage subsidies and take that
stress away.

Are there any policies or changes that have been taken
in this area since you have graduated that stand out?

Imenn in the last couple ofyears what Obama has done
has been impressive for instance the health care bill was
humongous and the stimulus package was essential.
