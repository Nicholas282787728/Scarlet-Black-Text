Foiled again

by Paula Rue v.

One of the lesser publicized sports here
at Grinnell College is back again this year.
While fencing may not be as heart-
pounding as the big name sports, it is a fun
sport to watch and take part in.

The current team IS a small one, and it
has been in previous years. This year‘s
team is composed oi Erik Rogers, Bryan
Dunn, Shirley Hamilton, Greg Vogel, and
Dave Scherman.

However, most other teams that Grin-
nell tences against are relatively the same
Size.

Grinnell started its Season a few Weeks
ago, What was supposed to be an open in—
Vltational with a number of teams, turned
out to be a dual meet against Luther Col-

lege, consisting of 8 or 9 fencers. For the
Pioneers, it was a successful alternoon.
The Pioneers swept the top three spots in
the toil event: Bryan Dunn, 1st; Greg
Vogel, 2nd; and Erik Rogers. 3rd. in die
epee event, Greg Vogel tied for second,
with Dave Scherman ﬁnishing fourth.
Grinnell has two more meets, and
another open invitational before moving
on to divisional competition, Practices are
every Tuesday and Thursday evening and
on Saturday afternoons. on Saturdays,
1:30 is the practice time for beginners and
3:30 is the practice time for advanced
iencers. it you think mat you may be a
budding fencer, come out to practice and
give it a try. ,

Women Pioneers
defeated

by Blair Davisoii

Last weekend's conierence matches pro-
ved to be disappointing as the Women‘s
Basketball team dropped two games, leavV
lng them ranked last in their region.

in Friday’s game against Knox, the
Lady Pioneers played a strong lirst halt,
and managed to hold on in the beginning oi
the second half. Problems developed,
though, and by the end oi the second halt
the powerful Knox team had pulled away
and won.

This is the second loss to Knox in less
than a month, but there may be an easy ex-
plantion as to why 7 officiating.

Deb McCarty, assistant coach. explains
ed: “It's a problem throughout women’s
basketbal...,[0fficials] call all the ticky
lack things 7 they’re very inconsistent
...,They’re not very up on the rules”.

Although citing oiticiating as a reason
for the loss might sound less than convinc-
ing, the team has a legitimate point. Many
of the officials serve all levels of play, and
have to constantly adjust to different
regulations related to varying levels or
play.

Another special problem is the sexual
duality of basketball. McCarty alluded to
the possibility that many officials are not
yet willing to call a more physical
women’s game.

This can be particularly trustrating
when one has a team like Grinnell with the
skill and ability to play a more competitive
game,

Saturday’s Monmouth game is another
example 0! a game shadowed by bad of-
ficiating. McCarty conceded. however,
that the women were unable to adequately
control Monmouth: “We weren't able to
contain some oi their big girls like we
should have.”

Still, in a weekend plagued by deteat.
players managed to turn in strong perfor-
mances, Deb Eastman had two strong
games; she proved to be especially strong
in scoring against Knox. It was Eastman’s
last pair of games this season, as she
heads for a second semester in Costa Rica.

The squad now numbers only nine
women; with another month of difficult
games ahead the Lady Pioneers are under
pressure to finish strong,
