NEEDED: .\ NEW FIELD I‘IDUr ll.

If the past few basketball seasons have shown us
anything, it is that Grinnell desperately needs a new
gymnasium or field house. Grinnell will soon be forced
out or the Missouri Valley conference, according to n
former Pioneer athlete now connected with the coachins
staff at Iowa state college, unless better basketball far
cilities are provided here.

a innell teams are as well coached as any in the
Valley; Grinnell teams fight as hard as any in the Valley.
But Grinnell's basketball teams will never win manv
games against their present opposition so long as they
must play one night in our antiquated men's "gym” and
shift the next night to a floor twice asdorge.

It is a far cry from the present to that golden age of
the past when this campus had the only real gymnasium
in Iowafthe days when the name Grinnell spelled victory
on the basketball court. 1s Grinnell's athletic glory-faded
forever? Are we doomed eternally to talk about the
Grinnell Spirit and then to accept defeat after deleat dur»
ing the basketball season, for no better reason than that
our gymnasium is the relic oia bygone generation? If that
is the truth, let it by all means be known and faced.

president Mftin's "\vtll'king program" includes plans
for a new held house and a scientific department of phy-
sical education. We can only hope that his project will
materialize before Grinnell finds herself an orphan in the
ilissouii Valley. R, B,

it is iic popular to suggest a change which will g

hit people in their pockelrhoolis. But the unpleasant fact; ,

e. sts that the semester fee must be increased ii Grinnell‘
activities e not to fall from their present level. And‘
:iitei- :ill. the "sem" fee is about the best investment which
we make at Grinnell.

Because at it. attractions like (tail Sandburg, Roy
Chapman Andrews, Will Durant, Alfred Cortot. Anna
(use, the Minneapolis symphony orchestra, the English
debaters, and university athletic teams ztppcfu' regularly-
on this campus, Such opportunities are no small advan-
tilge to :i college so rel-note as Gi-iniiell li-oni populous
centers. but the ﬁnancial problem of maintaining this
standard becomes more difficult all the time,

Tnhe debating as typical ol‘ all lee-supported rlCiilli'
ties, The debate appropriation amounts to about. 5425, as
compared with $800 at Carleton, 3600 nt Knox and Be
loit. and $500 at Upper iowa university. The lastruamed
institution has only a quarter of Griunell's enrollment
and correspondingly more modest pretensions. Newton
high scohol silent $400 on debating this yent‘gonl'y $25
less than Grinnell college. Under these circumstances,
what first-class high school debater is going to enroll at
Grinnell, so long as it olfers less in his chosen field than
the “prep" school from which he comes? And what fate
is in store for Gi-i'unell's vaunted superiority when she
begins to attract only second-raters, even in a minor ac-
tirity?

Euunlly strong cases could be made out for the band
and the lecture and recital courses. Athletics, though
now the recipient of more than half the total lund, finds

it hard to maintain the Missouri Valley financial pace,‘ '

and would have no trouble disposing of larger revenues, 1

that much sncce sfully without ti

that a college band should have three
main iunctions. First, it should he a
pop creating organization and should

cond, it should arouse an appreciation
ior high class instrumental music on
its own caiopii and third, it should
be a means of bringing Grinncll to the
