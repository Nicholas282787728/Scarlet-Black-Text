“Not a single student" has atv
tended the three Food Service
sub-committee meetings held since
the confrontation in the Forum
Grill over the new Grill structures,
according to Dave McConnell,
director of the Food Service

The meetings were publicized as
being open to all students in-
terested in voicing both their
concerns over the new structures
and recommendations to improve
their appearance.

of the three meetin 5, two

have been held by the Foo Service
sub-committee specifically to
obtain student opinions and
suggestions concerning the Grill
structures.
’ IN ADDITION, McConnell said
that ”maybe three or four" people
have come to see him privately
about the structures.

During the past few weeks,
McConnell and the members of the
Food Service subcommittee (a
sub-committee of the Committee
on Student Life) have been
discussing possible future
renovations to make the structures
less of an eyesore. So far, such
improvements as displaying
student artwork on the “turrets”
and enlarging the window area

have been mentioned. McConnell_

MURRAY SAID the project is
stlll very much in the research and
planning stages but already a
veritable wealth ofinformation has
been accumulated.

Students in the project are from
many different academic areas,
from art majors to economics and
physics students. The group in-
cludes many lreshmen and
students interested in ar-
chitectural design, Murray said.

TIIEY ARE divided into four
smaller groups. each group headed
and advised by a faculty member.
One group, for example, is con
sidering passive design features of
the project, such as insulation,
location and design of windows and
walls, site planning and land
scaping.

Another group is considering the
active design aspects of the
structure such as efficiency of
available solar collectors,
distribution and storage of heat,
integration of active solar and
conventional systems.

A Tlllnn group is researching
the economic problems involved.
Students work Closely with the
other groups on cost analysis of
various individual systems and
analysis of projected fuel' costs.

A fourth group is investigating
ways of monitoring the efficiency
and heat loss of the structure.

MURRAY SAID that a solar

pearance,

JUST RECENTLY the struc-
tures have been painted black to
reduce their conspicuousness and
to cover the graffiti that had
adorned the walls.

in a related development, Carrie
James, the student charged with
the structures,
reached an agreement with the
Office of Community Rights (OCR)
as to the disposition of her case.
The nature of the agreement was
not made public, in accordance
with OCR policy. .

SGA VICE-President Linda
Cornelius, who was responsible for
representing the student body in
bringing charges against the
alledged graffitist, said that both
she and James were “satisﬁed
with the agreement." _

She noted that while other
students had been identified
defacing the structures, only
James had been identified as'
defacing the structures on die ﬁrsti
night. All subsequent grafﬁti, she
claimed, was seen as “marginal,"
as the structures would have,
required painting anyway. She also
said that some of the later grai-

 

 

 

heating unit in the structure, as in
most structures, cannot presently
be expected to replace con-
ventional systems, but only aid
them

The first consideration in
housing of any sort, Murray said,
should be how to reduce heat loss,
He said that many modern homes
could cut their heat loss by 25 to 50
per cent if they were properly
insulated and if heat was ef-
ficiently distributed.

DESPITE THE recent con
troversy over the renovation of th
Forum Grill, McConnell stil
defends the necessity of tht
“turrets.” “Although there ar 1
few kinks which need to be war c
out, I am satisfied with th
operation," he said. .

McConnell estimates the cost 0
the “turrets” to be five thousanl
dollars. However, he states
the increased efficiency of the Grll
due to the renovation Will actual]~
enable the facility to pay for itsel
by the end of the semester. He alsl
says that the Forum Grill was no
instituted as a profit making 0
terprise and that he only wanter
the project to break even.

The actual idea of renovating th
Forum Grill came from last year‘s
Food Service sub-commit
members. Steve Potter, one of
year’s members, had ser .
reservations about the
“feasibility” of the “turrets," bu
after he learned that the entir
project would pay for itself in , 1
semester he decided to approve >
decision to renovate. “I mus
admit that they do look pretty
ugly,” he said.

ASKED ABOUT the possibilitie
for adapting a solar unit to '

replied, “There’s a big question a:
