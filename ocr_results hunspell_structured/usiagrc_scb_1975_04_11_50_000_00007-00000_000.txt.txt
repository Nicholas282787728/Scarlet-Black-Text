What? No Penguins

by J. C. Wooils
in man’s dreary dayrto—day existence, on the tired, cold bologna
Q sandwich that is liie, there are some events that are not much more
than so much mayonnaise; one wishes ior them, but when they come
they could have just as well have never happened. Others are cheese,
a warm mediating layer separating the bitter cold oi the bologna irom
the abrasive blandness of the mayonnaise; and beer; simplyuacr
companying the sandwich and making more palatable by allowing you
to ignore it, But some are pickles—iew and distinct, each having a zest
and excitement all its own, each causing you to take a iew more bites
irom the sandwich in hope another may be found. Coronations are
such things.
Coronation—say the word and it conjures up images of imperial
columns of trained dwarves somersaulting at the vanguard or the
'procession, preparing the way or our Lord. Following them is the
college orchestra on iloats made irom sprays of live Airican violets.
Then enter the Priests oi Cathedral Grinnell, each dressed in iull
academic regalla (which includes mouse lur Collars). Finally when all
this has ridden past in silent but glorious escalation, ive have a
crescendo. Enter the hero oi the piece, bedecked in gloriously glit-
tering garb, astrlde the milk white eriulgent Lincoln Continental. This
brillant cortege stops before Herrick Chapel where the ritual begins in
earnest.

The tradition dates trom the days ot JB. Grinnell. it seems that
back in 1846 when Grinnell College consisted of a two-room school
house, a soup kitchen. an outhouse, a stack oi archaic hvmnals and
just enough musical instruments to create an lowa band” (live
variously shaped jugs) 13. had to leave town in order to recruit a
student body. Upon his return, his first step, due to necessity, was die
outhouse. The door was jammed. The President‘s iirst reaction was
the vigorous application oi physical persuasion. This tailed
abysmally; ergo the President waxed even more eloquently laced by
the bodily innovation invocation.

Finally the door gave way. but due to executive inertia, he hurtled
into the outhouse to meet the most organic of iates. In memoriam to

the first official act of Gl‘innell‘s progenitor, we to this day preserve
the custom that directly after the Coronation a large tub ol fertilizer—
well, suiiice it to say, the Baptists would be pleased but then so would
(he ecologists.
