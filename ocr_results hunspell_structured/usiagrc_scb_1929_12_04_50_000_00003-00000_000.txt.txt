Lantern Seeks
Change at Quad

Seeks 10:30 Hours, Which
League Board Thinks

Unwise, Now.

One of the recent activities of Lan-
tern. campus group composed of the
heads of men’s organizations, has
heen to present a petition to the Wo-
men‘s League board, asking that “a
uniform weeknight closing hour of
10:30, Friday included, be adopted at
the quadrangle." The petition was
last week denied by the board which
alsu declined to g i v e Lane
tern a conference on the sub—
ject because, according to the W07
men's governing organization, the
latter has already taken a large
number of liberal steps this year, be-
yond which it does not seem advis-
able to the heard to go at the pre-
sent, because the board believes the
opinion of the women to he against
such an extension of hours and be-
cause, finally, the board believes the
matter to he one entirely within
their own jurisdiction.

Present Hours Too Early

On the other hand, Lantern pre-
sented a number of reasons for the
change in hours from 10 to 10:30
which it believed to be worth the
consideration of the League board.

stating that the present closing
hours are too early for general con-
venience, Lantern pointed out that
the present closing hour is early be—
cause it curtails the meetings of ore
ganizatlons and committees; be»
cause class Work, as aromatics.
and such activities as debate and
Work on the SCARLET AND BLACK
are interrupted; because dinner meet-
ings. as Forensic and Collegiate
Players, are‘ cut short, together with
other social affairs; because the
move would be in keeping with the
general trend of ,similancollege and
u 'versity cond sud ﬁnally, be-
cause Lantern believesth'et faculty
and student spprovalr'ot the change

. has already been informally indicate
ed.

What Lantern will do now that its
move in this direction has been
negatived is not known, but it is
thought the organization will con-
tinue to seek such an extension 0
hours. ‘

Parish has a ﬁne Boston hng, un-

was already for a trip to Denver
with the picked Missouri Valley

decided not to have one. However,
he may ﬁnd solace in the feet that
he was the only Grinnell player judg-
ed as worthy of honorable mention
by a New York sports writer, in
picking an All-American football
team. This writer was no relative,
either. says Parish.

Now that the football season is
over, we'll explain the formula
whereby we won so much money bets
ting on games. We simply went
down to the Sanitary Barber shop,
found how Dori Bantu was laying his
money, and then bet just the op-
posite. Don lost on every game this
season except one, and that game
was a tie.
