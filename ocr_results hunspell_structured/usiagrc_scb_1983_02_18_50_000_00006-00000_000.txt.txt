why has the men's swimming team been
doing so well? In an athletic program such
as Grinnell's, which can be best described
as “losing”, the men’s swim team stands
out as a notable exception.

In fact, Grinnell has something of a
dynasty on its hands. In the last six years,
Grinnell has won five consecutive con—
ference championships.

What enables the men’s swim team to
achieve winning record after winning
record while other teams manage only to
compete respectahly in their conferences?

Many attribute this success to the exper
tise of coach Ray Obermiller. “He knows a
ton about swimming,” said Kirby
Schaufler, a member of the class of ’82 and
captain of the swim team last year. “He
has the right attitude for Grinnell. He
doesn’t want you to sacrifice academics
{or swimming, he realizes that sometimes
you can't spend a couple of hours a day in
the pool and pass all of your classes.”

As head of Academic Advising, Ober-
miller understands academic pressures
more than most coaches. One aspect of the
swimming practices, which Schaufler
describes as “unusual“, is the fact that
Obermiller holds two practices a day, one
at 2:30 and one at 4:30, in order to accom-
modate everyone.

”I have a very loose policy," com-
mented Obermiller. “Although some peo-
ple may disagree with this, I believe that ii
the academics get tough, then athletics
should go. If they’re having troubles at
school, i try to go out of my way to help
them."

Although Coach Obermiller does
believe in a “loose policy," this does not
mean he does not get excited if something
goes wrong at the pool. “He likes to kick
chairs," said Schaufler. l‘When I
graduated, the team bought him a direc-
tor's chair. It had his name on the front
and it said ‘kick me’ on the back."

Another reason {or the team’s success
can be attributed to Obermiller’s excellent
recruiting. Coach Obermiller tries to draw

students who are just below the com»
petitive level set by recruiters oi the big
universities and who satisfy the academic
requirements for admission. Obermiller
stated. “We just go for people who are in-
terested and who can meet the high
academic standar .

This recruiting method adds much to the
depth of the team. ”In football you usually
have to look at 20 to 30 guys a year. But in
swimming, all we have to do is add tour or
five guys a year and have a team of amaz-
ing depth, considering we usually face
teams of eight or ten swimmers,” com-
mented Obermiller. “The thing most
responsible for our good teams in the past
have been the trips to Forida." The in-
famous trips to Florida have also been the
time for crazy antics and pranks.

Obermiller characterizes the typical
swimmer as someone more “outgoing and
ramhunctious" than one might {ind on any
other team. “They tend to have a good
time, all of the time, maybe too much of
the time."

During one of the recent trips to Florida,
the team transplanted a park bench and
placed it in front of the motel in which they
were staying. During the course of their
stay, many items of memorabilia, which
were acquired during their stay, appeared
on the bench. Among them: a white paging
telephone from the airport, a shopping
cart, hay from the Barnum and Baily Cir-
cus and a car door, which was supposedly
saved as a piece of evidence from a car ac-
cident.

“Students sometimes don’t realize that
some actions permissible on campus are
considered criminal offenses in the ouLside
world,” said Dbermiller.

They partied hard and they played hard.
According to Schauﬂer, “While I was on
the team we had a saying: if you're going
to soar with the eagles at night, you have to
swim with the fish in the day. Of course,
some of us soared more than others."

Obermiller made sure that this year's
trip to Florida went a little more smoothly.
Joked one team member, “This year’s trip
was pretty mellow. No one got arrested."

Concerning the future. Obermiller is not
sure the swimming team will continue to
win the conference championship in com-
ing years. “Coe will eventually beat us.
We've been doing a pretty good job of
recruiting here, but Coe has just been
recruiting like crazy.”

Yet, Obermiller doesn’t seem too wor-
ried. “An athlete here gets no scholarship,
no recognition. What other reason is there
to go out {or a sport but to enjoy it?"
