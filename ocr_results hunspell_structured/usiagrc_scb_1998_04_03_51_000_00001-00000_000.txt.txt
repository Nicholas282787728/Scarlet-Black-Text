Now that the truth is out, that caril-

a

‘ lon was amost rigltt next door, or at

a

least only half a block away from
Around's office on Filth Avenue, be-

- cause the carillon was tlte one in the

a

bell tower at St. Mary's Catholic
Church.

While the church’s organ was have
ing a service call, it was decided to
check the clarity ofsound on the carile
loll as louvers have been added to the
openings III the bell tower to protect
the carillon, and It was not clear how
well the sound was carrying.

Since the keyboard for the carillon
was right there with the organ, it was
an ideal opportnnty, and Around can
attest to the fact that the sound was
loud and clear,

The carillon was a gift to the church
in the I970: froin Jack and Rita Penne
in memory or their parents, and Jack,
who for many years was the church's
organist, was right there In the organ

With tltis issue the HeraldRegister
turns ovei a new year, this being Issue
No, | of the l3lst year of the The
Grinnell Herald»chlstcr,’ a commu-
nitytnstitution often taken forgrantcd,

which has served the local area for 130
years. That‘s since clear back in 1868,
14 years after GI-innell was founded.

Actually, there were two newspa-
pers forpartofthattimeThe Poweshiek
CountyHerald,whiehbecametheGI‘in»
nell Herald, was established first and
continuedunderavarlctyofnamesand
ownerships. It also included the Col-
lege News Letter which later became
in independent publication, the Grin-
nell College Scarlet and Black.

The Grinnell Register was founded
in 1878 and also underwent several
changesinnameandownershipbefore
the two newspapers were combined in
1936 and occupied the present build-
ing, built in l9lo, designed by the Des
Moines architectural firm of Rawson
Bird and Proudfoot and now on the
National Register of Historic Places.

The Register built its building at the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Broad
Street, now the site ofthe Cornet-Stone,
in the same year.

The earliest editions of the Herald
were printedin a building on Commer—
cial Street.

In a section called “Looking Back—
ward" ofan article about the history of
Grinnell newspapers from “Grinncll:
A Century of Progress, 1854-1954,”
printed at the time of the centennial
anniversary ofthe founding of the com
munity, the late A.L. Fnsbie, former
editor,wrote“The Heraldinthosedays
was an 8-column Z4~inch sheet, almost
big enough for a bed quilt. The front
and back pages were solid plate matter
and all the news had to go in the two
inside pages, No extra pages were ever
run,"

The plant at that time did have elccr
trlc power and one Linotype machine
for setting type, he noted.

He contrasted that wnh the modern
newspaper of his time, now 44 years
ago, which had three Linotypes and six
typewriters.

Little could he envision, of course,
the present-day publication oftlie Here
ald Register which is done completely
with computers and other electronic
equipment,

How many milcsol'ncws have those
130 years included: City council news,
SChoolboardnews,ti'agedles,tliumpl’is,
births, weddings, deaths, a compcn»
dlum ofall the big and Iittlc thliigs that
make a community function, recorded
ﬁrst as news, then to become docu-
mentation of the continuum of local
and personal history,

(Around‘s father who, as a Grinnell
College student workcd'part-time at
the Herald while it still was located on
Commercial Street, after his gradua-
tion in 1914 and a career in other pub-
lications, returned to Gnnnel130 years
later to purchase the newspaper In

“I was interested in attending Grin-
ncll College early on and knew that the
scholarship wouldmakeeollegealitile
easier ,to afford. The scholarship al-
lows t-nc to attend a great school, and
the college gives me a chance to chale
lengc and Improve myself,“ Ness says.

“As we see local area students suc-
ceed, we realize how intertwined our
community is. These students have
been supportedthroughouttheiryoung
lives by parents, teachers and other
concerned adults in the community,
and once again with the scholarships.
A strong college isn't possible without
a strong community, with people dedi-
cated to working together for the fu-
ture success ofour young people. We
appreciate the continuing suppolt our
community members provide, to our
students and to the college," says In.
terim President Charles L. Duke.

Other recipients ofthe .I.B. Grinnell
Scholarship are seniors Jacob Beyer
and Kristin Stuchis; third yearstudents
Aaron Wagner and Richard Werner;
second-year students Jennifer Loucks
and Mark Paulson; and ﬁrst-year stur
dent Abby Copeman.

“We have gathered together 3 won-
derful cross section ofleaders from the
community and the college to lead the
drive," Zimmerman says.

Vice chairs of the 1998 Town and
Gown Drive are Jeff ‘67 and Judy
Garland. Division leaders are George
‘56 and Sue ’58 Drake, Jeff and Gina
Finch, Brian and Nancy Heineman,
Stuart and Shannon Kintzinger, Torn
Lannom ‘66, David and Carol Smith,
and Netia Worley ‘7].

“When we expend our efforts to
honor the achievements of Grinnell
area students, we set the best kind of
example. When we put a high value on
education, helping our young people
pursue their dreams, we prepare them
for the future. Can we make a better
Investment?" Zimmerman says.

The NEA’s day in court:
a lose-lose exercise?

In about three months, the U.S, Supreme Court is expected to hand down a
decision regarding the constitutionality ofa law that commands the National
Endowment for the Arts to consider “genelal standards of decency" when it
decides whether an artist or organization should receive public ﬁnancial

support.

To many who believe in unfettered artistic expression, it is unreasonable
that the court should even be hearing this particular case. But Congress, '
reacting to a handful ofcontroversial shows and exhibits put on by certain
artists who aren't quite as tmditional as Norman Rockwell, decided to
impose such standards on the NEA — at the same time Congress was cutting
the agency’s funding. It was only a matter oftimc before someone would
challenge the language of the law, of course, so Tuesday's arguments were
fairly predictable. The outcome ofthe case is less so.

While it's true that two lower courts have overturned the provision, the
high court might well reverse those decisions. According to news reports,
severaljustices, at least for the sake of argument, questioned whether it’s
really unconstitutional to require certain standards before public money is

a

nmmﬁmmuaw1umm

approved for artistic projects. For
example, Justice Stephen Breyer
asked whether the government
should be required to subsidize
“art" created by white suprema-
cists pushing a racist cause.

Has the NEA made some
questionable calls when approving

grants? Of course, No agency is immune to error. Just ask the Pentagon. The
question is whether artistic merit should be the sole basis for such grants.

But all of this could well turn out to be academic. lfthe court rules against
the plaintiffs in this case, the NEA will be forced to narrow some guidelines.
Even iI'it does, the consequences probably won‘t be great in practical terms.
Ever since the controversies over works by Andres Serrano and Robert
Mapplethorp, the NEA has been far more cautious, having been stung badly.

If, on the other hand, the court agrees with the previous decisions and finds
the “standards of decency" language to be unconstitutional, the NEA might
be an even bigger loser. Why'.7 Because Congress might be so Irate as to push
through legislation that cuts off all funding. ’

The latter would be a real tragedy. All great nations have supported the arts
publicly. To leave all patronage up to the private sector would mean that lots
of new and unrecognized artists, whether potentially great sculptors or
composers, would be unable to find even meager support for their work. In
this regard, the NEA has provided a great service to American culture. and
bringing that to an end would be unthinkable.

So it would appear that, no matter what the Supreme Court decides, the
NEA is going to be anything but a winner. But the public at large could be

the big loser.
