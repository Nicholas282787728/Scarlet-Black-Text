 

One of the best scrimmages ol the
year occurred last Wednesday night
when the coaches sent the second team
against the iirst, and the seconds won
by two touchdowns. ln justice to the
first team men, it must be said that
they were minus the services of life-
Clain, who has done consistent work}
at right end all year, and Pederson’J
the fighting center, was hurt and harl'
to be taken out early.

Heldridge, the big tackle candidate,
got a bad crack in the jaw that night,
and hasn't been able to be out for
practice since.

For the second team, the entire
backfield (Jones at quarter, Wing at
fullback, Critchett and Kingery at
halves) showed up well both on of-
fense, while Taylor at left end Wzls
the greatest star in the line,

Captain Critchett was hurt in scrim-
mage Thursday, and was not able to
be out last nighL It is his old trouble
of last season that is bothering hlml,
but it is hoped that he will he recover-
ed in time to appear against Cor,

McClain hasn‘t been able to partici-
pate in scrimmage all week on ac-
count or a bad leg, but it is expected
that he will be fixed up in time to
start the game next Saturday.

"Cappy" Jones, whose sensational
return of a punt in the last few min-
utes of play against Drake lest Sat-
urday, brought the stands to their
feet, and has been doing some good
work in practice this week, and will
probably get into the one game.

Allan Bradbury of sioux city seems
to be general utility man for the prep
team. He is one of the cleverest
backfield men of the squad and has
been working at both halfback and.
fullback, but last night he appeared at
quarter for a while in Evahn's place.

The Pioneers have always been un-
lucky in the m‘atter of injuries. Wood
and Scharnweber have been out all
season. and while they are both out
ior practice now, it is doubtful if they
will be able to get in shape in time
to play next Saturday.

Gates is unoihel‘ man on {he scrubs
who did Sam‘s.v nice work packing the
ball when he was put in against the
preps in scrimmage last night. Hei
fumbled once, though. and was given
the some medicine handed ‘out to
Johnson and M'eeter earlier in the
season- to can? 2| hall to classes for
three days.

Moyer at center seemed to be knock-
ing them off in old time form when
he was sent in to relieve Peterson last
night.

"Red” Grange, star Illinois halfback
and Walter Camp’s choice for an All-
American berlh last fall, added furth-
er fame to his name last Saturday
when he made four touchdowns in
