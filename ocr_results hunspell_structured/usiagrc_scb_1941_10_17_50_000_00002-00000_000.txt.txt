O The Chapel Door.

It is the chapel hour. The whispers and
rustlings of the congregated group subside
as the speaker on the platform rises. For
a moment there is that deep hush that
presages great things to come.

Bang! Bang! The startled orator pauses.
No, it is not an enraged saboteur in the
audience, just someone coming in late. The
speaker tries again. He reaches a climax,
pauses dramatically. Bang! Bang! Don‘t be
alarmed; it’s just the Gates hall troubadors
arriving en masse.

Perhaps in the good old days when our

reverend fathers built Herrick chapel, no
one was ever late. We just wonder if even
at this stage of the game such simple door-
slam deadencrs‘ as felt lining or air com—
pression springs couldn’t be applied.

Failing this, perhaps the Powers That
Be could equip each chapel speaker or
musical performer with a pair of ear plugs
to keep out offending noisesr Or maybe an
anti-door—slam league could be organized to
watch over and properly handle the outer
door during all chapel services At a last
reeource, possibly the students of Grinnell
might even be induced to be on time to
chapel services

9 Prep Pep.

”Hell-week” is just around the corner.
Judging from the pathetic performance of
the class of 1945 at the first football game,
we can hardly wait.

The freshman class was well-represented
last Saturday afternoon. Two-hundred
strong, they did make a pleasing appear-
ance with their brilliant scarlet toppers
bobbing in the afternoon sun. Sitting apart
in their own section, they did have an
excellent opportunity to display their class
and school spi What was the result?

Results were not forthcoming. Only
the determination of many hull elders
to settle their proteges at the appro-
priate time in the appropriate place.

Maxims dealing with the wisdom of tak-
illg kindly advice can be quoted from every
philisophy and language. Our advice is
simple, freshmen If you want the rest of
the school to notice and respect you> show
your mettle at the football game. Shed
your inhibitions Give voice to your long-
repressed desiresr Appoint some freshman
cheer leaders, originate some yells. But
make some noises! !

We believe that the Class of 1945 is no
better and certainly not any worse than its
predecessors. But we’ve got to be shown.
