Marsh Company of Minneapolis. The
same Hm is now engaged in work on
the new Alumni Recitation Building.

When completed the three buildings
of the proposed quadrangle group will
provide quadrangle facilities for 126
men, Very probably the preference as
to who shall take these rooms will be
given the upprcclassmcn, but the de-
tails of this plan have not yet been
worked out.

Go Up West of Grandstand.

The buildings will be constructed on
the ground west of the Ward ﬁeld
grandstand. The southernmost one of
the group Will be it double structure

‘ “Most Complete in U. u."

"I think we gain SEIY Without ducSr

N0 EXTITA VAGATIGN
THIS THANKSGIVING

Students Will not Have Friday off—
Only Two “'eeks' Recess .it Christ-
mils Time, But Spring Vacu-
tion Lcugtlrencd.

Chr tmas vacation will be shortcu-
ed to two weeks this year, extending
from December 20th to January 3d,
and the spring recess will hc length—
ened to the same period of time, ac~
cording to a statement just given out
at the College Office. No classes will
be held Thanksgiving da, but work
will be resumed the foliourng Friday,
as usual.

Previous to 1913 it had been custom-
ary to have a Thanksgiiing vacation of
three days. In the fall of that year
the Student Council sullmitled to the
Faculty for consideration a calendar
for various parts of the years work.
Several revisions were suggested,
among these a lioi'te ' g of the
Thanksgiving vaca ion to a single day,
and the addition of the two remaining
days to the holiday reccs . This on;
gcstion was immediately accepted and
put into force. The calendar has re-
cently expired, but in the absence of
any conflicting sentiment on the part
of the student body, has bcen l'ildol'lr
nitely renewed.

it has been thought for some time
that the Christmas vacation was too
long, because an undue amount of timc
elapsed so shortly before the scmcstcv
examinations. Two days have there»
fore been cut from it and added to
the spring recess, which foimcrly cor»
crcd only tWChc clays. This change
will undoubtedly rncct uith the an
provztl of the entire student body.

Spring \acation will c. end [mm
Thursday, liar i ' , to Wednesday.

Contrast in PlityillgiTecll-
niqnc Is Pecul . .

Eight hundred fifty enthusiastic
music lovers kept their seats and vige
uronsly clapped for one more selec-
tion when Josef Hofmann ended his
program at the Chapel last night. The
same number of enthusiasts willingly
credited Mr. Hofmann with being with—
out douht one of the world’s greatest
pianists.

Never for a moment during the two
llnur program did the noted musician
lose the interest of his audience, which
was one of the largest that has ever
been seated in Herrick Chapel. He
played, they listened; and at the end
of each group of selections he was en-
cored for more. All told, he returned
for a total of three extra numbers dur-
ing the program.

Master of Every Sitlllltioil.

To those who were present he was
master of every situation. Besides his
seemingly perfect under-standing of the
audience, he gavc a wonderfully in-
spirational interpretation to every
passage. It could be seen that he felt
cvcr thing be playcrl, that it was his
own self that was, rn a way, speaking
through each note.

ITELIIIT TEAM IS STHGIIG

II First llackllelll To Send Against
Scarlet and Black Aggregiition—
Couch Depends on buy

To Run Team.

Hamper-ed by the loss of Watt at‘
quarter, Grinnell is playing the fast
Beloit aggregation at Beloit today. All
this week the coach has been whip-
ping the team back into shape after-
the Iowa game. The loss of last sht-
urday’s game has in no way discour-
aged the men. The team left for Be-
loit Friday morning with no expecta-
tions of an easy game.

Last year Grinnell defeated Beloit‘
23 to o. The alibi that Belnit gave for
the score was the fact that the game
was played in mud. The team from '
Wisconsin depends upon its speed
rather than weight to make gains.
when the field is very muddy it is
more difficult for fast backfield men
to score, and heavier opponents have
a decided advantage. The scarlet and
black team this year has a line that
was even impi‘cgnztble against Iowa,
and it should prove a stone wall
against Iowa, and it should prove a
stone wall against Beiort.

Beloit Team Strong.

With most of her vctcr us back thrs.
year, and with the adrli on of more
wciglrt in the line, Eeloit presents a
team that is much stronger than the
one she had last year. If weather con-
ditions are favorable for Bcloit's style
of play, Grinnell u ill have to fight all
the way for a lictol'y, which should
be nothing but hard earned.

Tile coach is depending upon Jesse

he cannot flip passes or handle punts

en iaurcls, Dr. Fanny 0. Gates, Dean
of Women, gave the principal address
on “Cllllllre.” From the report in ibc
Daily Illilll, she made a very favorable
inrpr --oir with her audience, The
address placed great emphasis on the
things which concern life.

“There are two great universii ,s in
the walk] today," said Dr. Gat “They
are the Uillversily of Illiuoi whose
colors are orange and blue, and the
Unlrc ty of Life, whose colors are
black and blue,"

"We are only at the beginning of
the red tion of the mental resources

going on around us, and not until \yc
have a picture of life will we be able
to sp its significance The two
great needs of today are the ability to
