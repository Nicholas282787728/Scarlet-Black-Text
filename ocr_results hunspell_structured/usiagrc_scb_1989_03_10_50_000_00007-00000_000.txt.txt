The Dogz' "hoodlum rock" attracts rowdy crowds

by Mike Ellis

If you want to hear the Dogz
play some of their “hoodlum
rock" you can probably see them
once a month or so at Hector'sr
where they have played so often
in the past. Or you can go
within a block of 1020 High
Street, where they practice. The
air of High Street just south of
the campus is filled, almost
daily, with the sounds of their
tunes. This is where I headed
when I set out to interview the
group one evening this past
week.

When I arrived at the cramped
back room of the once-green, de-
crepit building known as Phlcgm
House, the Dogz were standing
around, instruments at hand.
Before I could get my first words
out they burst into song like they
Were doing an audition or
something. I thought, “What the
hell, like I’m from Rolling Stone
or something? As if I came
prepared with great questions" It
made me a little nervous. They
were calm about things,
especially as I was asking
questions, and suddenly a huge
green rat crawled onto my lap, I
was hoping it was a pet. The
freaked-out girls upstairs dyed
him, someone explained,
Probably revenge for all the
times their music-making has
kept them awake. The episode
convinced me that it‘s not just
the music that makes the Dogz
so popular, but their
personalities.

There's Ian Gamble on lead
guitar. The Dogz “bluesoriented
classic rock" lets Gamble flash
the fingerpicking talents he’s
developed since the young age or
seven, Gamble is not new to the
stage. He appeared on “A Prairie
Home Companion” at the age of
11 playing a banjo.

Accompanying on rhythm
guitar is Tim Grossman.
Grossman always looks like he is
having the most fun in the group
playing concerts. He has a
perpetual smile plastered on his
face. I‘m never quite sure of the
reason; it could be the music or
he‘s just plastered. I think it's
the music. Grossman started
playing guitar his freshman year

and sometimes wonders if he can
keep up with Gamble‘s iasr

ﬁngers. Regardless, he’s enjoy-
ing playing with a band and
figures he‘s learning from
Gamble.

Bassist John Goolsby is the
lone music major in the group.
He was Gamble’s roommate
sophomore year when the band
was formed and takes partial
credit for their popular name.
What the name means, however,
remains a secret. He began
playing bass as a freshman,
quickly picking up the inv
slrumcnt and receiving praise
from many for his ability.

Drummer Jeff Hurling, a
sophomore, is the youngest and,
perhaps more importantly, the
best»drcsscd member of the
group. Harling keeps the beat
with black wing-tipped shoes for
every Dogz concert. He was the
only member of the Dogz to have
experience playing in a band. At
his high school in Evanston,
Illinois. l-Iarling played with a
band called Tum Left.

Senior Gene McClure relishes
the opportunity singing hard rock
as a break from the Grinncll
Singers. His graduation next
year brings into question the
future of the Dogz. The Dogz
have not indicated when they will
be auditioning for a new singer.
McClure will be in law school at
the University of Iowa next year,
close enough to be back for an
occasional guest appearance

As I popped out questions, I
noticed the Dogz were answering
politely but uncnthusiastieally.
Harling hid behind his drum set.
Gamble stood in the comer occa-
sionally reeling off riffs and
adjusting his amp. He tossed out
quick one-liners but his guitar
had more answers than he did It
was almost as if what the Dogz
were about couldn‘t possibly be
captured with the printed word,
much less my words,

A Dogz concert is like no
other on campus. They‘ve been
around long enough to capture a
following ,Crowds react with
howls of approval when the band
plays such classics as “Wild

Grossman thinks the blood-

alcohol level of the audience is a
factor for their loud approval. He
describes the Dogz’s music as
“good to drink to, not necessarily

to dance to.“
Gamble thinks their success

must be attributed to the timing

of their debut when there were no
other campus bands. “The
campus was hungry for a band,“
said Gamble. The laid-back,
easy-going persona the band has
developed must also be responsir
bio for evoking enthusiastic re-
sponses. Remember the black
vests with the sparkling Dogz
embroidered on the back',7

Of course the rowdy
atmosphere of Hector’s also helps
to arouse a crowd. The dark
surroundings, which seem to
appeal to Grinnellians, has
almost become associated with
the band since its beginnings.
“Hector‘s was our genesis," said
Gamble. The five met there over
some beers in the fall of 1987
and agreed to start the band.
After practicing with a minimal
amount of equipment (no
microphone, and a cardboard box
for drums) the band appeared for
the first time in Hector's.

Friday night, the Dogz will
not be playing in Hector‘s but
next door in Gardner from 8 to to
pm. (or the Loose Hall
Cannibal].
