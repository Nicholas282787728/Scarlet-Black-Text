Family, corporate menaces and violence

Enron (PG 1

If there were ever a corporation that made Wal—
Mirt look positively saintly, it is Enron.

Filmmaker Alex Gibney’s Emmi: The Smelt/e
err Guys m r/ze Room shows how Enron became such
ti successful corporation and Iiow its top exccutives
garncred as much orrhe proﬁr that came from that
success as possible. The ﬁlm is a brilliant, enraging
chionicle ofthe rise and fall ofthe corporation. Gibr
ncy's portrayal orEni-on is easy to follow, full ofsatll‘ir
cal knockout punches and engrossing anecdotes.

In the ﬁlm, executives Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skiiling
and Andy Fastow (Lay and Shilling are currently on
trial) pull every kind ofeconomic trick known to man
in order to deceive the public and drive up stock pric-
es. It works brilliantly, as Enron stock rises to over $90
a share and the company gains national attention with
a doomed business plan.

Even Enron's employees refuse to look into how
the company is doing business. In fact, they seem to
emulate their executives‘ ethics. In one memorable
scene, two Enron traders observe, with greedy den
light, raging ﬁres in the California desert, knowing
that these natural disasters will ultimately pad their
back pockets. (“Bumbaby burn!" one says in a phone
conversation.) They buy into their employer's shoddy
morals and work toward an even shoddier result: thou-
sands ofunemployed workers, left with stock options
worth nothing and non-existent retirement plans.

Don't worry though. Lay, Skilling and Fastow all
got out of the stock market in plenty oft'iine to save
their families. Feel better?

Enl‘oll' Tb: Smartest Guys in [lye Room rs more
than just that typical Wednesday night t’orum docu-
mentary. It’s not just another film expounding upon
the evils ofcoiporat‘ions. It’ll leave many Grinnellians
enraged. educated and vindicated in their distrust of
capitalism.

A HI ry of Violence (R

Many of us have passed a car wreck and caught
ourselves slowing down to survey the damage. In an
attempt to describe this primal fascination, director
David Cronenberg would show us A Hiltary ofVioe
lent: and all its dark depictions of brutality and car-
na e.

gThe ﬁlm explores the relationship between people
and violence. The story follows Tom Stall (Viggo
Mortensen), a man whose dark past is revealed to his
unsuspecting family after a freak incident. The effect
this violence has on the family is massive, and direc—
tor David Cronenberg, known for dark films such as
Crnrh, NakedLum}: and exiltan, does what he does
best, crafting the film into a hypnotically dark muSt
terpiece.

Less extravagant than most of Cronenberg‘s pre-
vious films,A Hormy afVio/enrr is a blunt and brutal

piece. In an early scene ofviolence, a man is shot in
the face (no, not by Dick Cheney). With any other
director, the violence would be hinted at but never
shown, but since this is a cronenberg ﬁlm, we are
subjected to the image of a man shot through the
mouth, pathetically trying to breath in a pool of his
own blood. The scene is a classic example ofCroncnr
berg’s perverse style.

The film's dichotomy of before the violence and
after the violence is probably best exempliﬁed in
the ﬁlms two sex scenes. The ﬁrst scene is a play
ful rolerplaying encounter between Tom and his wife
Edie (Maria Bello) in which she has dressed in her
high school cheerleader uniform and whispers in her
husband’s cat, “Qliet or you'll wake my parents." But
in Tom and Edie's second sex scene, it is apparent that
the emergence of violence has had an effect on their
relationship. Gone is the tenderness ofa quiet rooni,a
bed and a cheerleader outﬁt.The scene eiupts in puie,
brutal passion and animal lust on a wooden staircase.
The bruises that we see later on Bcllo's back are the
actual bruises that she got from filming this scene,
(Someone get the lady an avoid or something, at least
an ice packl)

Too risky to receive nominations for any Academy
Awards other than for adapted screenplay, this movie
has been overlooked by the Hollywood avord system.
Industry be damned, this film is easily better than two
ofthe films nominated for best picture, and Croncnr
berg really deserved credit for his excellent drrcction.
For a ﬁlm that emulates the perverse reeling ofwit-
nessing a scene of destruction,1‘1 Hixzal y off/{alum is
right on target and should be viewed by all who are
not disturbed by the subject matter.

the richly textured and often messy nature of true far
miljal relationships without having to resort to over-
wrought melodrama.

Madeleine (Embeth Davida) is a cosmopolitan
art gallery owner who, after a whirlwind romance,
marries George (Alessandro Nivola), a transplanted
Southerner. She deals in “outsider" folk art and is
interested in representing an eccentric artist named
David Ward (Frank l—loyt Taylor). Coincidentally,
George’s family lives only a half—hour away from
David's home in North Carolina, so six months af-
ter their wedding, Madeleine and George head to the
South for three days in order to secure David's art and
meet George's family for the ﬁrst time.

George's decidedly middle-class family consists
of Peg (Celia Weston), the skeptical matriarch; Eu-
gene (scott Wilson), his reserved but kindly father;
his btothetjolinny (Benjamin Melteneie, even more
silent and brooding than his famous character on The

ac.) and his pregnant sistctrinrluw Ashley (Amy

Adams, in an Oscar-nominated performance). Each

member deals with the tension caused by Madeleine’s
urban sophistication and her new place in the family,
and it is these relationships that provide substance to
the film. '

To describe any more ofthe plot would do the film
an injustice because, with (he exceptIOn of one trau-
matic event, little happens. Nonetheless, this is still a
great ﬁlm. fumbug’s beauty lies not in its complexity
or narrative force. but rather in its ability to subtlety
explore emotional dynamics. Firslttime director Phil
Morrison ably provides the authenticity this cxpltr
ration requires by utilizing the mundane. Morrison
largely avoids overly dramatic moments and instead
focuses on everyday interaction. In his hands even a
screwdriver can be a conduit for understanding. This
style requires patience. Like life, junrl'ng is rarely eXr
plicit.

Although occasionally funcbug borders on the
edge of tedium, its authentic feel and emotional reso-
nance results in a ﬁlm far greater than the sum or its
parts. ‘
