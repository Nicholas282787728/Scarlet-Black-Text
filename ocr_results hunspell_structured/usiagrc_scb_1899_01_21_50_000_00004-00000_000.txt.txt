out. Murry humorous anecdotes
and pertinent sayings accompanr
ied the more serious and biographr
ical portion or his speech. He
said in part: "The last hall of
the 18th eentury was a dark age
in literature, Form had Stlpcrr
seded thought, and poetry was
stiited and artiﬁcial. Burns came
as the ﬁrst forerunner of the pr0~
gressive ioth century. Few, it
any poets have obtained such a
hold as his upon the hearts of the
people. He will live as long as
men and women have hearts.
Everywhere he is quoted, read,
Sung and loved. Thus the subject
of Robert Burns is an important
one. In him we must consider
two men, the good Robert Burns.
and the had Robert Burns. His
lite was cursed by his appetite ror
liquor, and under this inﬂuence he
wrote poetry almost of a blaspllc-
mous character. while at other
times his work was of the most
exquisite grace and beauty, as for
example, ‘The Cotter's Saturday

oi the laborers and the common
people, and his power is most
ﬁrmly grounded in their hearts.

We may call his lite inirlty and
wasted, but we must nevertheless
recognize him as the possessor or
a soul which was, at times, able
to rise above the shackles of his
body, and to express itself in the
words of the true poet.”

Mr, Carleton, in closing, related
several anecdotes of his vrsrt to
Burns‘ homo and relatives, which
added greatly to the interest of
his lecture.

This opportunity or hearing Mr.
Carleton has been highly appre-
Cizlted by the students, and both
or his lectures were excccdlllgiy
enjoyed. He is a poet whom ev

we now feel even better acquaint
ed than before.
