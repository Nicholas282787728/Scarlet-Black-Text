Giovanni will prove to be a
very interesting and captivating per-
sonalit “She can catch you up in her
convcrsationoi style while you are still
trying to decipher the inconsistencies
in meter and syntax. But when you
are tinishcd you {ind that, whether you
are Mack or white. you have been
moved in a deep, basic, emotional
way.‘

One oI the hettei'sknown of black
political leaders is Julian Bond. He
will speak in South Lounge on April 5.
1980 Matty will probably remember
when Mr Bond co-chaired the
challenge delegation trom Georgia at
the 1963 Democratic National Conven»
tion, and his tight there against the
handpicked delegation led by then-
Goveriior Lester Maddox. He also
became the first black nominated [or
Vice-President but his age disqualiﬁed
him for the post.

Bond addresses himself to many
issues. but his primary interest is in

«Political reformer, poet highlight BMW

the domain of politics and how they at-
icet the people. “Julian Bond sees the
New Politics as an outgrowth of the
ClVll rights movement of the 1960's. As
one at the founders of the Student Nons
Violent Coordinating Committee, he
participated in the voting drives, sit»
ins and other activities of that move
ment until his campaign for state
Representative in 1965." Because of
his views on the Viet Nam war he was
precluded by the Georgia legislature
from occupying his seat in the
Assembly; but in 1967 the Supreme
Court announced that the Georgia
State Legislature had erred in refus»
ing Mr. Bond his seat in the House. In
1974, Mr, Bond was elected to the
State Senate, where he currently
serves.

He ass ‘ts that in order for blacks
to be effective on the national level,
there must be sufficient and effective
black representation at the local level.
He lJ -lieves that one must exert
pressure on the political system tor it
to be truly receptive to the needs of
the neglected, In this sense Bond
is ottentim ctcrrcd to as a man who
concerns himself with human issues
with “human ideals and concerns, not
Just tor the politicians and power
blues.”

In this present age at Conservatism
the people must assemble in mutual
cooperation to attain political freedom
from those who would deny them etc
tuctive representation. Nell Irvin
Painter, in characterizing black
political strength in the nineteenth
century, adds that black educational
modernization was not accompanied
by sustained political modernization.
Whether or not this argument is true
tor the contemporary black American
is questionable; but the argument
does appear to imply that political
strength has been effectively diluted
by white political sophistication. Nell
Irvin Painter may not imply that
blacks are weak politically, but the
argument does indeed suggest that
black Americans have been unable to
turn educational modernization to an
effective political purpose and
representation.
