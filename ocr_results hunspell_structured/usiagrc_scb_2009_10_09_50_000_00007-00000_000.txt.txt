Orchestra blends Beethoven, Bagpipes

BYMATTHEW BACHTELL

on Sunday, Oct. 4, the Grinnell college orchestrabegan
a promising season with its first concert, entitled Beethoven
and Bagpipes. Preparation for the event began one month
before, almost as soon as the school year began,

“One month into classes, and with such tricky music—
I’m really glad the way things went,"Erlc McIntyre, the con—
ductor, said.

Two soloists were brought in for the performance. Fro-
fessor of Music Eugene Gaub, a worldtrenowned pianist,
played solos during the Beethoven piece, and local Rob
Clower was featured in a concerteending solo on the bag-

ipes.
P “The bagpipe was actually very easy to work with, be-
cause the parts were simple. But for the Beethoven, he’s so
good that he’s a little bit above us, almost intellectually, while
we're playing," Will von Geldern,’11,concertmaster, said.

The concert opened with “Piano Concerto No. 4 in G
Major,” by Ludwig van Beethoven, featuring Eugene Gaub
on the piano. in typical concerto format, the piece is in three
movements: Allegro, Andante con Moto and Rondo Vivace.

The Allegro opened with the piano soloist introducing
the theme, a rest and then the orchestra joining in. in places
the group lacked energy, but the pace improved as the piece
progressedThe Andante began with a dialogue between the
soloist, playing softly and the orchestra, coming in with loud
staccato chords.The transition into the third movement, us-
ing a wellerecogniaed Beethoven melody, was seamless.

The second piece was the “Fugue from symphony 4," by
Charles lves, a famous experimental composer. The syme
phony itself calls for two conductors doing two separate
things at once, which had to be modifred for this produv
tion.The fugue was characterized by strong melodies drawn
from church music and beautifully played by Sophie Haas
’12 on the organ.

Peter Maxwell Davies wrote the third piece, “An Orkney
wedding with Sunrise," composed in 1985, about a wed-
ding he attended while in Scotland. The pieces main body
consisted of three wedding dances broken up by periods of

dissonance in which various instruments drunkenly intere
rupted the theme and each other. Rob Clower closed the
piece with a traditional morning greeting on the bagpipes,
representing the drunken walk back from the wedding as the
sun broke dawn.

The orchestra adeptly carried off rhe unique show, be—
ginning a season that will hopefully continue to showcase
both their skill and ingenuity.

screaming Females, a threeepersoa rock
band which boasts just one female, scream-
ing or otherwise, will be performrng this Fri-
day, Oct. 9 in Gardner Lounge. The openers
for Friday’s concert will be Mrlitary special of
Minneapolis and two of Grinnell’s finest:]us»
tin 3002 11 and Chris Davies 11.

Based out of New Brunswick Screaming
Females is led by a notoriously effectual, not to
mention petite, Marissa Paternoster, on vocals
and guitar. The band also
features Jarret Dough-
erty on drums, and King
Mikkhis birth name—
on bass,

Screaming Females’
Friday night show is
part of their Midwest
tour, visiting choice cities
such as Detroit, Chicago,
St. Louis and, of course,
Grinnell. The band will then continue on to
perform in Wirlous parts ofNew York.

The band's sound can be broadly catego-
rlzed as punk rock, With an idiosyncratic twist
on the genre that gives Screaming Females
music originality.

“I’d say they are noisy art rock with some
heavy punk influences," said Alex schechter-
’10, Concerts Chair.

While featuring the punk rock plel‘equlsltc
references to darkness, rebellion aiid death,
screaming Females wraps rtall up in a package
of catchy pop belits, nPTronnng guitar solos
and interludes of hiiirsrziising screams that res
ally put the “screaming"rn Screaming Females.
This unique conglomeration of rhythms, Vce
cals and instrumentals makes for a stimulating
listening experience, sure to please the Friday
concertgoers looking to blow ofrsome steam
to start offthc weekend.

though.”

”I would maybe compare [Streams
lng Females] l0 Fucked Up In terms
ofmuilclunili/p and craft. Probably
fewer giant naked sweaty bald men

-The band initially drew their musical ins
fluenees from other rock bands in New Jersey
such as The Ergs and takes much pride in their
New Jersey origin. In terms of their sound,
Screaming Females are comparable to bands
such as Fugazi and The Stooges,

“As for [similar] bands that have previous
ly come to Grinnell, 1 would maybe compare
[screaming Females] to Fucked Up rn terms
of musicianship and craft," Schechter said.
"Probably fewer giant naked sweaty bald men

.though."

Screaming Females,
a band previously kept
largely underground~
quite literally as the band
enjoys performing in
basements—has recently
seen a rise in popular
rty. While the band
self-produced their first
two albums, Baby Teeth
and What if Someone is Watching Their T,
V., they have signed on with Don Giovanni
Records for their latest album, Power Move
which was released earlier this year, The band
also made their first 1ch debut on MTV last
August,

The fact that screaming Females'populiirs
ity is currently escalating should come its no
surprise, as Grinnell's Concerts Committee is
constantly on the lookout for bands on the rise
that ensures affordability as well as talent.

"Concerts is really cool because not only
do you get to see a bunch of bands for free,
you also are possibly seeing a bunch ofbands
that are going to be hugc,"Danc Harken ’12, a
member oftlie Concerts Committee, said.

so be sure to attend the Screamrng Fe-
males concer-r for a rockin' Friday night. While
Paternoster probably won't suplex anyone, they
might still be the next big thing,

The mockumentary is a tricky type of film
to execute as it often consists of dry humor
that can be as easily offputting as it is enjoys
ableThe Flyrng Scissors, a reccnt addition to
the genre, follows competitors as they prepare
for the National Rock Paper Scissors Chame
pionship. The director, Jonah Tulis, uses a
formulaic approach that draws heavily from
previous films includingA Mighty Wind and
Best in Show, where a counter culture ofin~
dividuals are seen taking their seemingly silly
lives far too seriously,

The problem with this strategy is when
the dead pan jokes don't land, and they hardly
do here, the audience is left dead silent and
feeling progressively more awkward as each
joke falls flat.

Tulis lingers on every aspect of the 10
competitors’lives, which really causes the plot
to sagiespecially because each character :5»
sentially embodies a different cliche‘.To mime
a few, there's the trash talking black alpha-
male, the math obsessed Asian, two burn
outs, the air head blonde and Asher Roth.
All are over exposed and not a single one is
likable. When the actual competition begins,
well over an hour into the film, it feels like
there might be fraally some form ofa purpose
revealed to the frlm. However, the competie

tion is rushed, despite some long shots ofrwo
people playing rock paper-scissors, one los-
ing, looking disappointed and then walking
away. This happens over and over, the camera
doesn't move closer, the audience is forced to
be a spectator up in the bleachers with the
100 or so college-aged extras instead ofdown
in the action.

Somehow the lack of intensity in the
competition makes all orthe characters seem
even more pathetic. Scissors fails to fake the
mockumentary passion achieved by Best in
Show and This' is Spinal Tap Those characV
ters, though absurd, were still a part ofsomee
thing much larger. Spinal Tap was laughable
as a band, but they still had enviable aspects
in their lives. The characters in The Flying
Scissors have no desirable qualities, which
makes laughing at them incredibly difficult.

Oddly, the production company for the
film has decided to a run a special limited
rclcase only on college campusesThe theory
must be that undergrads will both be drawn
to the film’s humor and able to spread word
about ﬁlm easilyia cheap and effective mar-
keting scheme. Ofcourse, not many students
will be drawn to a film with no buzz and an
unfunny trailer. 50 rfyou're looking to laugh,
then Flying Scissors is not for you.
