College Centrals Air “Pet Peeves”
When Off Duty Reporter Finds

Operators Rate Banging
of Theme Receivers
as Worst Sin

Air “Pet reeves."

However, when the girls are off
duty they feel free to air their
”pet peeves." “The thing that
gets me down,” says one operator.
"are the rfellows who hem and
haw around and don't know whom
they want to call," In addition
to these undecided young men
there is the prep who asks the
operator tor a suggestion, and
the persistent beau who calls the
second fluor of every cottage
hunting tor a date.

Perhaps the worst is the one
who calls, “I'm looking for a
hlonde. I don't know what her
name is but she rooms with
Dorothy. Well, I don't know
Dorothy’s name, but she’s tall
and dark and rather thin,"

Also annoying to the college
centrels is the girl who answers
her phone when some one elses
rings, just because she is sure
that he is going to call her. Equ-
ally disturbing are the boys who
answer the phone when it is the

Worst Sin oi All.

The worst sin of all, the girls
claim. is hanging the receiver.
The switchboard has an especially
sensitive ear phone and when
someone hangs a receiver it ‘5
certainly not appreciated. Many
of the adults on the campus, as
well as students, are guilty oi
this, Other discourtesies practicV
ed are jiggling the hook, and re-
fusing to take incoming calls.

The switchboard is husier this
year than ever before, there be-
ing more students and more
phones. The offices of the reg-
istrar and employment bureau re-
ceive the most calls, with Dean
Beatty being a close second. The
girls in James cottage received-
the most calls last year, but
just now the freshmen cottages
are being rushed. With the wom-
en's varsity planned for this
weekend, the phones in the dor-
mitory are ringing often. The
busiest hours are 12:45 until 1:30
o'cluck in the atternoon and from
5 to s and 7:30 until 3 o’clock
in the eveni g.

When the “herd books" are
published, students will be requir-
ed to give the room number they
are calling in order to receive any

service.

l Famous Orchestra

,to Give Concert
on October 23

, Bohumir Kryl, conductor and
world-famous cometist, is bring-
ing his symphony orchestra and
Margery Maxwell, soprano soloist,
to Grinnell for the first number
on the recital course. The per-
foi'mance will be given October 23

This organization, now making
a consularcoast tour, is entering
upon its thirty-second consecutive
season. During the period since
the organization of the orchestra,
more than 1200 concerts have been
given, and the group has travelled
more than a million miles,

According to recent criticism in
Chicago newspapers, Mt. Kryl is
regarded as one of the outstand-
ing conductors of the country.
“The technical discipline which he
succeeded in establishing with the
competent group of players was
admirable. But it was his gift to
dramatize the music in the very
gestures that he conveyed his in-
tentions to his musicians that per»
shaded his public," one reviewer
said.

Resign yourselves to famous
names in sports. A few weeks ago
it was James Fennimer Cooper at
Marquette. Now Benjamin Frank-
lin, at the University of Detroit,
is working at tackle.
