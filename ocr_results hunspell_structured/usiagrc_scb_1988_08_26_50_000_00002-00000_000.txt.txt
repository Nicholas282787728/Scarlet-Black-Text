Overcrowding strains
dormitory limits

Due to a lower than expected
attrition rate, coupled with El
higher than expected number of
incoming freshmen, Grinnell
College started the year 44 stu-
dents overcrowded.

"It‘s as overcrowded as it's
been for sometime." said HousA
ing Director Diane Dougherty.
The college maintains a list of
17»20 rooms which are desig-
nated as "overcrowd rooms"
which are especially large fresh-
men rooms, However. due to the
number of extra students
Dougherty had to select about 25
additional rooms to serve as
overcrowd rooms.

 

Freshmen were put into rooms
as though there was no over»
crowding until all of the rooms
were full. The order of students
placed into rooms was determined
by how soon each student had
paid the enrollment deposit.
Students who paid first were
placed into rooms first.

"What I did wasI went to ev»
ery freshman room on campus
and sized them." she said. She
then rated them to determine the
largeSt rooms that could be used.
Students who were placed into
the smallest overcrowd rooms
will be the first to be placed in
other rooms when openings be—
come available.

office

McConnell given additional duties

by Barbara Brown

Administrative supervision of
the Bookstore and campus post
office has changed hands from
Waldo Walker, executive vice4
president and treasurer of Grirtnell
College, to Dave McConnell, di-
rector of dining services.

McConnell. who received his
MBA. from the University of
Iowa in May. described his new
duty as the "administrative liai~
son to Waldo" Walker. Mc-
Connell said he will work with
the management of both the post
office and Bookstore "to enhance
the service and expand upon the
servioc that‘s there."

Torn McBee is the manager of
the Bookstore. and Clyde French
and Dean Douglas co-manage the
mail service on campus. "The
difference is that those managers
report’ to me," instead of to
Walker, said McConnell.

Critical Service Center

The post office, while "one of
the critical service centers on
campus." according to Me»
Council, is also a "difﬁcult space
in which to work" He is
investigating how the mail ser-
vice can improve service and cut
down on waste. His goals are to
improve "the speed of service,
quality of service, and having a
presence that's positive on cam-
pus."

One change McConnell already
has made is to start direct mail
service to professors in the Hall
of Science. According to Me-
Connell. "Part of the reason [for
direct delivery] is that we don't
have enough mail boxes. We
don't have the physical space or
the boxes to accommodate the
size of the staff,

If you really look at the time
taken [by professors] to walk
back and forth to go to the post
office...it seems to me that a
PhD. could be doing better
things, i.e. they’d have more
time for students for meetings, or
more time for research. or more
time for class preparaLion, than

coming back and forth to do
something as pedestrian as pick»
ing up mail," he said.
The post office is testing the ef-
fectiveness of direct mail service
by delivering to the Hall of Sci-
ence August 8 through Septem»
ber 15. If delivery goes well.
faculty in the Fine Arts building
would be the next to beneﬁt from
direct mail service. Professors in
Carnegie and ARH, though, are
likely to retain their post-office
boxes. McConnell said.
"Carnegie and ARH we probably
wouldn’t [give direct mail deliv-
ery] simply because they [faculty]
can walk downstairs and walk
upstairs. and there‘s no good can
tral point in those facilities to
which to deliver mail."

Otherwise, McConnell antici—
pates ”expanding as much direct
mail service to points of where
there's a concentration of people
as we can. ljust think that that's
better business from the stand
point of getting [mail] into the
hands of people quicker." he said.

McConnell said that he has re-
ceived comments from faculty
about their mall’s not being
available early in the morning
and about the post ofﬁce‘s being
"a 100 a 9:50. If we can get the
mail to [faculty] by 8 or 8:15 in
the morning. it seems logical
that [faculty] would have more
time to do things of a more pro»
ductive nature."

Physical Appearance

Service is not the only area of
the post office to receive atten—
Lioni "We are going to work on
improving the physical appear-
ance of both the facilities and
staff, over time." said Me»
Connell, For employees of the
campus post office. changes
"may mean something as simple
as having shoes on...and dressing
like they would for more normal
sorts of activities."

McConnell described the

changes in dress he has in mind
for the post ofﬁce staff as basin

cally "common sense stuff." For
example. students would be re»
quired to wear covered shoes, as
opposed to sandals or wearing no
shoes. [or their own protection
while working with boxes that
might fall on their feet. He also
plans to provide employees with
some sort of smock or jacket to
wear in order to protect their
clothing. but he said that wearing
them would be "not necessarily"
mandatory.

”I don't want us not to look like
students. either." added Mc-
Connell. "I don‘t want us to
look like we're something that
we aren't I want us to look
good. I want people to be pre-
sentable. I'm sure that we will
institute some kind of policy that
says that if you're wearing a shirt
with a big tear in it and stuff like
that, that's not gomg to be ac-
ceptable. That‘s not cool either.
You‘re not going to be able to
get away with that in the real
world. and I don‘t know that
campus“ employment should be
anydiffcrent. V "’

"Whether we like it or not. we
want to try to keep people look-
ing halfway presentable there.
simply because everyone comes
through [the post office] on a
campus tour. You get a lot of
[tourguides saying],»'Here's our
post officé....' You kind of look
and you think, 'Is this the begin»
ning of the Dungeons and Drag-
ons game or what? It's not the
most appealing spot on campus."

McConnell said that comments
he has received about campus
mail service indicate that the mail
room may need a more profes-
sional iniage.
