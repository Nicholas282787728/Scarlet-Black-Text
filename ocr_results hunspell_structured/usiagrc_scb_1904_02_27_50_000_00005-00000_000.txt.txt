committee appointed to report at

constitution, drawn up with reference
to the proposed two district plan and

Fred J. Clark, of Cornell College,
won the State Oratorical contest lﬂt
night. Second place was awarded to
J. Newton Colver, of Simpson, and
third to Frank M. Beatty, oi Iowa
Wesleyan University. Well may the
Sainted Father ol’ Methodism chuckle

to himself Over these three triumphs ‘

and the splendid Showng of his fourth
place representative, Harry A. Bryan.
or Upper Iowa University.

There is no room for any feeling in
the minds of those who were present
but: that of complete satisfaction in
the quality of the productions given,
the way in which delivery was made
and in the ﬁnal result of the contest.
Ml‘. Clark’s easy attitude on the ﬂoor,
his strong argument and clear, earn-
est diction made a deep impremion on
every one. Mr. Colver’s style, his re<
sourcefulness in illustration his
hearing on the stage and his pleasing
manner of speech made him a favorite
with the audience and few there were
who would have been surprised to See
him marked ﬂsrt, just as there were
few who were surprised at the victory
of Cornell.

In Mr. Beatty, Winnerofthird place,
Iowa Wesleyan possesses an orator or
great promis When more expere
ience and trai ing have given him a
greater degree or ease on tne platiorm
none of those who iieardl his oration
last night will be Surprised to hear of
his further success. Nor were the
winners of places alone in their excele
enter The program throughout was
such as to keep alive interest and en»
thusiasm in all pints of the house ex:
cept in those numerous benches which
remained empty as a result or Iowa
College's indinerence to her standing
as dsupporter of worthy enterprises.
