Girls Express Their
Desire To Be Aviators

What Gi-iunell girls would do in the
war il they weie men-

“If I Well: a man, Id like to be a
sniper, out in a shell crater, ‘geuing
them' one by one; and really ‘geuing
them would be my idea of doing at—
fectlve work.”

“If being a private would win the
war, 1 would gladly be two or three of
them."

"I would travel up and down this
land demanding thousands at dollars
fol the renal or the Eulopelm peasants
so that they could have hot watei more
than twice a week and a. taste or hot-
Lel' at least on Christmas."

“I guess I would be best in the sig-
nal corps. it would be pretty hard
not to shout out the message, but it I
was a man, maybe I wouldn’t want to
talk so much."

“To be the ﬁrst in line when the or-
dcr “Over the 101)” came, would crown
my happiness."

“Even and being a chaplain or "Y"
worker doesn‘t seem much like war
work, yct there comes a time in the
day of a soldier when he must have
coml'ort and attention."

"1 wouldn’t mind the mud nor shell.
lire, il I could only drive thc alnbur
lanocs up to the approach trenches
and curry ilic wounded soldiers hack
to relici."

About tlirc lniirths oltlic gn who
uxpi-csscd their opinions would like to
he aviators. “Fight hard wlllle you
last," seemed to no the sentiment.
