Pioneers \Nin From
Tulsa and VVashbum
As Valley Opens

Grinnell‘s basketball team con-
cluded its three-game southern
trip with a so to 32 victory over
Tulsa Monday night,

It took a rally in the last two
minutes of play for the Pioneers
to overcome the Hurricanes lead
that appeared to have cinched
the game for them. John Turner
led Coach Truesdale's squad with
some sensational shooting to gar~
ner 14 points in that contest.

Previous to that, on Saturday
night, Grinnell met its first con-
ference defeat of the year at the
hands of the defending champions,
Oklahoma A. at M., 33 to 27.

In this game, the team
tired from its victory over Wash»
burn the night before and the
subsequent journey from Topeka
to Stillwater. None of the men
could hit the basket consistently,
making only nine out of 63 shots.

in Topeka, the boys picked up
a team mascot in the person of
Ferdinand, the Bull. It is held by
everyone concerned that Ferdie
nand will bring success if success
is to be attained.
