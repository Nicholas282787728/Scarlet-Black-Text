New rules for Gardner

by Tom Zlabinger‘

This week the Main Hall Coun-
cil finalized the rules for the use of
Gardner Lounge. an issue which has
been unclear since the opening of the
Harris Center in the Spring 1991.

Any Gn'nnell junior or senior
can recall when every allreampus
party was held in Gardner and bands
like Soul Asylum, Lemonheads and
Smashing Pumpkins played there.

Many studentsmiss Gardnerzind
don'tliketheHarrisCenterbecauseit
is simply too big and lacks the same
social atmosphere.

Several students and campus
bands have asked it’ they could use
Gardner for parties and concerts. But
the Main Hall Social Coordinator,
SGA and Student Affairs have all
said that the Harris Center has to be
used instead,

The purpose of the mles that the
Main Hall Council developed is to
clarify Utis misunderstanding, Since
the l’irst floor lounge in Main is re-
served for formal events, Gardner is
Main's only lounge,

With the restrictions on Gardner
and the fact that only unamplitied
groups will be booked at Bob's Un-
derground, it is no surprise tltatthere
are fewer performances by campus
bands and ' more professional
blinds don't visit Grinnell.

The following are the rules for
tlieuseofGardnerLoting ‘selforlh
