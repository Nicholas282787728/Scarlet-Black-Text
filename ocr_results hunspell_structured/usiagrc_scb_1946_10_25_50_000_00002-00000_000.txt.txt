WITHOUT HONOR

Recent evidence that 112 Grinnellia-ns are able
to trust neither themselves nor their comrades
taking examinations is discouraging and a savage
blow to the college and students. It would be
foolish to interpret the 1esult as on announcement
that one ninth of the student body intend to chest,
but the cynical attitude displayed by so many
students is no less startling.

There was no cvidence of a bloc vote against
the plan; instead, the obvious facts are that a
student mmority from all parts of the campus
were unconvinced either of its worth, or
could he made to work. The tragedy is that so
inanypersons voted in favor of it and then felt
themselves degraded by its defeat,

n'In the very fact that so large a majority did
favor such a project lies in the strength of the
system, Aside from a minuscule minority who may
have voted no because they helieved it would be
more difficult to cheat under the honor system-—
persons who should be expelled as soon as they
are discovered—the minority consists of several
dozen students who are merely unconvinced that
such a system is practicalibut who wo1dd abide
by it themseli-i-s were it in effect,

A weak, unenthusiastic and somewhat boring
campaign must therefore he blamed for failing to
convince them that a testing system based on Mr
dividual honor works. It must be admitted that
the campaign fell far short of the color, excite-
ment and interest aroused 111 the past by house
elections, or the nomination and election of the
student council president

Result: A reactionary minority defeated a
major progressive step supported by the adminis
tation, faculty and a preponderance of the stu-
dent body.

And the position this minority has taken is
absolutely indefensible. For the scheme is working
on campuses throughout the nation. Carleton,
Pomona, Princeton and other schools accept the
honor system without question, while at Crinnell,
school of Pioneers, 112 students are so eravcn,
faithless or unprincipled that they dare not under—
take the procedure,

Let no one deceive himself, Far too many
students have shown that they want and believe
in the project to allow honor to become a dead
duck at Grinnell. Now they must take heart and
learn from the mistakes made in the campaign.
For it is up to them (in put the plan over.

THE ISSUE IS NOT DEAD, AND [1‘ MUST
NOT BE ALLOWED To DIE.

VEXED VETS

_ Clancing through one of our professional
journals this A.M. we were brought to a screechr
111g halt by this headline, “Music Aids Vets' Ad-
- justment." It seems, we found on further perusal,
that at 0119va our sister Liberal Arts institutions,
1 Burnwell college, the administration in conjunction

with staff psychoanalysts has found that a com:

pulsory daily program of soothing and enurely
unsubversive music aids in the difficult adjust-
ment that the tense, overreager, hard-bitten vet
must make to campus life.

Speaking for the administration, Dean Larkin

Cherbirth told the reporter, “I can spot a vet any
where, they're all alike—grasping, dissatisfied, and
.maladjusted. If you ll pardon the technical jargon
we, 1 ., the Prexy and I, call them victims of
regimentitis. We realize that with their conditioned
thought patter,ns the vets offer a strong bloc
against the progressive, intelligent elements of the
administration which I, of course, represent. I
know at first hand that the vets are in a. bad
way, having been a service man myself. However,
by reason of greater maturity and acumen, I

Twenty- double columned pages of statistics
proving Cherbirth’s contentions followed. Having
waded through these figures we were met once
again by Cherbirth. Said he,

The Dean closed with a remark which seemed
to belk for an instant his own magnificent confi-
dence, “Sometimes the action of the veterans are
so 'variied that I forget they\are all alike.”

CATCHING COLD

According to the State Health Department,
the cycle of influenza A has reached a point where
we might expect a severe epidemic some time
during the coming winter. Schools and communi-
ties all over the country are initiating mass innocur
lation programs to protect their citizens againsti
the dreaded epidemic.»

During the widespread epidemic of influenza
in November and December, 1943, a military com-
mission investigated the inﬂuence of the concen-
trated vaccine in a series of Army Specialized
Training Program units comprising 12,500 men.
A11 injection of mixed influenza virus vaccine,
types A and B, was found to exert a protective
effect for a period of approximately five months.

Among 6,211 unvaccinated controls, the
attack rate of influenza was 711% while at the
same time the attack rate among 6,263 vaccinated
subjects Was 2.22%. These favorable results led to
the production of this vaccine on a large scale
for use by the armed forces.

The health departments of Yale and Illinois
universities have already started a thorough pme
gram which includes the innoculation of students,
faculty, and employees, as well as the children of
students and faculty members.

The unusually crowded conditions at Grinnell
would make an influenza epidemic a very serious,
matter. We would like to see‘ an organized innocu-
lation program take place here so that the stu—
dents, faculty members, and employees can he
protected against a threatened epidemic.

The trustees of the college who
witnessed the performance of "Be-
yond the Yeais last Saturday
night have asked me to add their
own word of appreciation to this
public note of thanks. We con-
sider the production Saturday
night, in spite of its technical
difficulties, one of the greatest
performances that we have seen
at Grillnell for many years, To
those of 11s who know the extra-

,oi~dinnry difficulties under which

thc/ play was written, staged, and
produced, the performance Satur—
day was extraordinarily fine. The

'b-ostei, Cleveland freshman; andlscenery, the 'costuming, and the
jCeorgia Battin, Main freshmaniacting weie all superb. The book

of the play possesses qualities of
reel greatness. The story it told
was a dramatic representation of
tiie beginnings of this college.

It is the strong feeling of the
trustees and the administration
that this play should be repeated
later in the year under conditions
which make possible the realiza-
tion of its essential greatness. We
would like to see this play repro—
duced at Commencement in 1947
with as nearly the same cost as
performed so magnificentlyv on
Saturday night, and with the ad-
iantages of those technical re-
fincments which will enable the
author, the producer, and the cast
to do full justice to it,

To all who contributed time.
