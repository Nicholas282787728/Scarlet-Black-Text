Taken as a whole the Missouri
eleven will depend for much of its
effectiveness on the weight of both its
backﬁeld and line. Guards and ends
are still a question mark which will
take a game or two to size up:

Although Grinuell has actually
played one game already it is almost
as difficult to determine its true
strength as that of Missouri. Fre-
ouent substitutions, penalties and
perhaps a trifle of over confidence
combined to make the score of last
Saturday's game useless as any true
indication of the actual strength of
the Pioneers. A few things, however,
did stand out more prominently than
others.

Grinnell should have a line which

and a battering ram on the offense.

Backfield material also showed up
well Saturday except for the chang-

hinder the smooth running of the
plays. Difficulty in picking holes
which the line men were opening for
them was perhaps the most apparent

Under this plan the freshmen does
