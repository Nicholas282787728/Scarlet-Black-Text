No more Skip Day?

Will Skip Day be abolished? it appears likely, At the last faculty
meeting this question was hotly debated but finally tabled to be
reconsidered after break.

Faculty sentiments regarding Skip Day appear negative. Skip
Day disrupts schedules, many charge, Also, according to one
professor, ”It has lost whatever advantages We saw for it at the
beginning " Many claim that it does not function as a “pressure
valve," as it was intended to do

Some members of the faculty suggest that Skip Day be changed
to once per year, and others suggest that if Skip Day is to be kept,
more warning be given beforehand. Others favor outright abolition.
Whatever option the faculty chooses, it seems that Skip Day as we
know it might Soon be a thing of the past, although SGA President
Greg Youtz believes, “I think we might be able to change their
minds."

Boycott urged

The National Organization for Women (NOW) is leading a
nationwide boycott of traditional student spring vacation spots:
Fort Lauderdale. Florida, and Lake Havasu City. Arizona. Neither
Florida nor Arizona has ratified the ERA. Students are urged to
write to Florida and Arizona tourism officials stating why they are
not vacationing there this year.

The boycott effort is being Coordinated by law students of the
University of Wisconsin. For more information contact Marjorie
Schuett, Women Law Students' Assn , University of Wisconsin Law
School, Madison, Wisconsin 53706.

Be glad it’s Christmastime again,
The singing of familiar hymns . . .

A time of soft candlcglow,

Of holly wreath and mistletoe.

A time of goodwill, love and joy,
With gifts for both girls and boys,

A time of mcnimcnt and mirth

Arid ill each heart comes a stir;

A deep desire to celebrate, i
The meaning of Christmas in rclatc.
We’re glad it’s Cllrisullostilllc again . . .

The 1976 film The Man Who Full

fourth film, is a curious Work.
David Bowie plays the man who
comes to Earth seeking water to

His quest is soon subverted; he
becomes an inventor, begins
earning $300 million a year and
develops a taste for good gin as his
thirst for water slowly vanishes.

All this sounds a bit dangerous,
even'lnoralistic, but a fine cast
helps Roeg bring it off. Bowie is as

It was also Consulted on the
Carnegie bookstore addition, last
year’s Forum Grill structures and
Macy House. The firm of Dougher
Rich and Woodburn (which in-
cluded the present Woodburn‘s
father) was responsible for Loose
Hall (1948] and Younker Hall
(1951).

TURNER ADMITS that con
troversy has surrounded recent
campus buildings, such as the
science building addition and Macy
House. but believes the problem is
caused not by particular people,
but by a lack of overall coor-
dination. He feels his proposals to
adopt a campus master plan and to
hire an architectural consultant
would adequately handle the
problem. “There is no one totally
controlling what is done at all
times . . better in»house controls"
are needed, Too many things are
“done by committee" in a
piecemeal fashion, he adds.

One product or this type of group
deCISlonrmakIng process has
aroused much controversy: the
suggestion to add a fourth floor
onto Norris, According to Dean
Waldo Walker, “The first time the
possibility of (adding a fourth
floor) was suggested officially”
was at a meeting of Physical Plant
Director Dale Hawn, trustee Ted
Lovejoy, Dean of Students Jim
Tederman and Walker.

NO DECISIONS Will be made
in the immediate future about the
final iate of Mears. Turner hopes,

 

made before the beginning of the
next school year. Although the
building is expected to be
nominated to the National Register
of Historic Places this January,
final listing will not come until the
summer. The only certainty. he
states. is that no one will occupy
Mears after next Semester.

And what about O‘Neil‘s idea
of tearing down‘lvlears and, then
recreating it? The suggestion has
provoked various reactions. Ken
Browning believes, “It's a valid
option." Richard Turner adds that
if it really could be done well, ,“it
might be something worth thinking
about."

BUT WALDO WALKER in-
terprets O'Neil’s suggestion as a
“semi-facetious comment." He
believes O'Neil- " a‘de‘ 'the
suggestion to mdk'e'oliv‘l‘ous his
point that a renovated Mears
would prove far more expensive
than starting all over again,
“O'Neil is no fool." he comments.
If the college wants to preserve
Mears as an “historical edifice,”
then “recreation is not the an
swer , . . You’d lose the historical
value of it under those conditions,”

No faculty members, when
asked about their opinions on
O'Neil's proposal. merely laughed.
But unlike the faculty and Walker.
trustee Ted Lovejoy taks the.
proposal quite seriously. He thinks
it is a fine idea. “It would be far
cheaper to tear the thing~down and
put something up exactly ‘like it,"
he says.
