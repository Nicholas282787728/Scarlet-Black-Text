lnexperienced Team
Faces Pioneers for
Renewed Rivalry

Cedar Falls, latiIowa State
Teachers college's Panthers will
present a somewhat inexperienced
team when the Grinnell Pioneers
invade Cedar Falls Saturday.

Conch Clyde L, "Buck" Star-
bech will have a team on the
field that will average from 175
to 179 pounds and will have seven
lettermen.

The fourteenth renewal of the
gridiron rivalry that began in
1909 finds Grinnell the leader in
the series to date with six wins,
four losses and three ties.

If history repeats itself, the
battle Saturday will be close, with
plenty of thrills expected from the
brand of football each team plays.

Spirit is high in the Cedar Falls
camp as the team makes up in
pep and fight for what the Pair
thers lack in experience.

Releases from the Tutor publi—
cation hureau indicatc that Grin-
nell will be facing a team with a
good offense and with emphasis
on the quality of blocking.

The Tutors’ starting lineup will
probably be Breitbach and Stain—
brooh. ends; Jensen and Cook,
tackles; Roberts and Rabey,
guards; and Kagan, center. The
backfield is composed of Bute,
Dutcher, Burchhard and Kane.

hearty pat on the back after their
cooperation last week end iin ob—
serving respectable qulel: hours
for the benefit of the football
players. Of course, such prac-
tice must he continued through
the season and with the hard

up this Saturday, Friday night

It presents a real challenge to the
men's hulls, especially with open

t ueeh we were pretty luolry

in our prognostications with some
of the big games of the week
and managed to pick four out of
five as winners. Minnesota sur-
prised us by heating the Pacific
coast conference favorites, wash-
ington U., and Iowa's impotency
against U. S. L. A. came as a
surprise, too. This week’s dope
sheet has indicated we should cast
our ballots in the following way:

Grinnell 13, State Teachers 5.

Drake 26, Washington U. 0.

Minnesota 14, Nebraska 0.,

Ohio State 27, Indiana 6.

Stanford 14, Sa'llta Clara 12.

When Filled with this Modern Ink

Created by Parker to guard pens from
pen-clogging inks . . . Ends 69% of the
fountain pen troubles

There is notizmd never has beeniany other pen
designed to handle all kinds or inksigund and bed
—ns well as the revolutionary Parktr Vacumstic.
one reason is tlint this modern invention has no
rubber lnl: sac, no lever ruler. no piston pump. It
is ﬁlled by a simple diaphragm, sealed in the top,
where ink can never touch or decompose its
working parts.

And its patented Television barrel lets you SEE
the l:v=l of ink at all tim=hsee when to reﬁll.

Thls pedigreed Beauty of lnminsred Pearl and
Jet is everywhere acknowledged to be the grandest
pen ever created Yet even this Guaranteed
Mzcllnnically Perrect pen can be plugged up by
the grit and gum in ordinary writing mks.

Hence to guard the celebrated Parker Ptns from
pcn- clogging inks. Parker experts developed this
utterly new kind of writing ink—called Quin ——
nn ink that actually cleanses nny pen as it writes.

This is done by a secret ingredient, wholly
harmless. it dissolves the gum and other troubler
some particles leit in your pen by ordinary inks. it
make; your pen a seli. cleaner—cleans as it writes

Parker Quink is full bodied, rich, and brilliant.

. . A Marvelous Creation!

Never watery or gummy And it dries on PAPER
31% quicker than :vcrage, due to stepped- up
penetration. Yet Quink costs no more than ordi—
nary inks—small bottles, 15c and 25:

if you use an ordinary pen, you need Quink
even more than does .1 Parker Pen owner to
keep it in writing condition If you use a Parker
Pen, you ll be thrilled and sur land by the way it
periorins when ﬁlled with Qufnk For until we
created Qumk and the Parker vbturnatic Pen,
there nevtr wns a really scientiﬁc writing com-
bination.

Those who can afford the best will not rest until
they how them both. The Parker Pen Company,
