A MID-WEST COLLEGE JOURNAL.
(F 0m the Harvard Alumni Bulletin)

One of the \Vcstern colleges with
which Harvard maintains an exchange
of professors, Grinnell College in
Iowa, lius made a signiﬁcant departure
in the ﬁeld of journalism. it has
Converted The Grinnell Review, a
monthly periodical published by the
college itselr, from the more alumni
journal which every American college
and university has made fam‘ ‘ar to
its graduates, into a publicatiomde-
signed to appeal to intelligent readers
primarily as such. What The Sewanee
Review has long done for the Uni—
versity oi the South, What The Yale
Review more recently, on a. more ex-
tensive scale, has done for Yale, The
Grinnell Review now undermkcs to
do for Grimm“.

The project is based upon the as.
sumption that the real power of 1
college lies in its power to impart an
intellectual and spiritual impetus to
its sons after they have left their
purely ncadcmic pursuits and not
merely to provide them with football
scores and other bits at college news,
The editorial board 0! The Review

It is an important element in the purv
recently late those who do not accept all the
implications of the editoidal state-
lnent: “There has been a tendency in
this part or the country, it is tine,
to announce with pedagogic dogma:
tism the creed of the renaissance
artists that beauty is truth, and hogs
and cows, being ugly, are noneexist-
ant,” To combat this creed, and to
express both revolt and harmony with
regard to the existing order, is the
present purpose or The Gi'lnuell Ree
view.

The multiplication of just such or-
gans, liberal seed-grounds of thought
and discussion, is an encouraging
symptom of the times A special web
come should be extended to them when
they appear in new centres, some»
what apart from the more turbulent
tracts of American life. For all con-
cerned with Harvard journalism they
may well prompt the inquiry whether
more might not be done, through ex—

ﬁelds. It seems 8. just criticism to
say that these regulations were not
sufficiently emphasized when they
were put into eliect,

The importlnt thing now is to give
them full publicity immediately.

only the outstanding minds and dc-

vclop them as fully as no no. This
is setting the pace tor the high grade

Is it not a bctter plan to sot the
pace only a little faster than that
,whiclt ‘llio aver-ago ability of the class

stimulated while the lnlwgl'ade moms

The high-grade student, ml the other
band, need not be held down. It the
pace or the class is too slow for him
be may increase it personally to any
speed. professors are always glad to
suggest outside reading and guide in-
dividual research in the subject so
that tliu high grade student need never
feel restrained. The slower pace of
the average only gives him time to
dig deeper.

In no course in any liberal arts
college can all the material on the
subject he presented. It is attempted
to present, and rightly so, only a small
part, the most fitting to needs in ones
tion. But the student or real inlellec»
tuul ability does not stop with this
small part. He searches further, and
with his class going at the pace of
the common average, he has more op—
portunity to do so. _

Set the pace a little higher than
the common average. The slogan,
“The Right Pace tor the ”high“. Stu-

GlthNELL AND MSEMLL

Considerable ( cussidn pertaining
to the reITestiiblisllmg cf inter—collegr
ate baseball in Grmncll College, by
tanner students returning from mili-
tary scr ce. as well as the newer
members or the college student body.
has been heard in tho Dormitdi ,
the last month. Surely, it the stu;
dents will support baseball, as many
declare, the college should rercsmhs
lish intercollegiate baseball.

The three arguments usually used
against intercollegiate baseball in
Giniucll, as summed up by the “Sport
Enthusiast," in a recentli. be of the
s. and it, needs ulscu. ion to prowl
the fallacy in them, or two of them
at least.

The ﬁrst reason, according to this
“Enthusiast, is the multiplicity of
or sports in the spring, among which
are track, tennis, spring football, and
rowing (in eastern schools). It sports
of eastern schools are considered
Griunell should have baseball. Prince—
ton, Harvard and Yale have baseball
nines. Track is the only present {no
tel'»cullegiate sport of Gl'lnnell college.
Each spring there is some talk or a
tennis schedule with other schools.
but, cl late years at least, the tennis
matches have been between students
or this college. Spring football is
never inter-collegiate in most institu-
tions, and the gridiron athletes usually
spend the summer gegting out of con-
dition after such a period, with the

lrehult that a spring football period
' is a needless expense to the school.

The short period in which baseball
can be played because of the proximi—
‘_ty of summer, is given 8.5 the second
‘argumcnt against the national pasA
time. Despite the usual rainy spring
month more baseball games can be
played‘than the number or football
lgamcs extending over the usual three
months gridiron season in the fall,
and in comparison with the track
season, which usually starts later in
the spring, the-number of possible
baseball contests tar outnumber the
weclecnd track meets.

Tlic prevalence or baseball as a pro-
fesslunal, scmi-proiessional and inna—
tcur sport throughout the country is
given as the third reason against base-
ball in college here. Pi-oiessional

teams or the luturc will need players
who today are getting their necessar-
experience and rudimentary knowledge
of baseball on amateur nines, if
colleges couldn develop amateur play-
crs lor proicssional teams, the play»
ing ability and baseball reputation oi

college. Through this medium c . im-
ulus might be ' on lltlllclieally in-
cliuod prospt‘ctile studolils to enter
the institution trom which the

up to the “big Show." l,

ilmicy spent inr spring toolboll'
touching \volllrl practically pity tor a,
baseball coach. "Larger schools ill
able to support three or lrlur spring
sports to a certain dcgrec of excells
once.“ declares the Sport Enthusiast,
or Wednesday night II that be true,
then ~ii~ely Grinuell could support
tuo spring sports. llcccuse baseball
has not been played since 1916, track
has become the major sport in Grim
uell. Why not lreep traclr as the major
sport and have a minor inter-collegiate
sport in baseball?

With the present endowment cam-
palgu under way and much newspaper
publicity wanted by the college, with
discussions among members of the
classes in school indicating the stu-
tleut body will support a nine, with
good material here for such a team.
and considering the fact that the moli~
oy usually paid a football coach tor
sp ng practice can he used for b' ' g
a competent baseball tutor, surely it
is ditiicult tor the mi minded sport
adherent to see the disadvantages in
revestablislling baseball in Grinncll
College as an inter-collegiate sport.
