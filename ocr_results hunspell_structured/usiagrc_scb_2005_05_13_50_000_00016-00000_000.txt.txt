Grinnell takes home’ most MWC championships in a decade

xv JOE GEN!

Grinnell athletic teams combined
this season for the most Midwest Conr
ference championships since Newt
Gingrich became Speaker ofrhe House
and the Cowboys and Bills played in a
second straight super Bowl, Six teams
established themselves as the MWC’s
cliteimen's and women‘s Cross Coun-
try, men’s and women‘s swimming and
diving, and men's and women's [cur
nis. Should either of the outdoor truck
teams prevail this weekend, Grinnell
would match what it accomplished in
1994, when scvcrl teams won confcrr
encc titles. Those seven were: men's
soccer, men‘s cross country, women’s
cross country, men’s swimming and
diving, women‘s swimming and diving,
men's indoor track and men’s outdoor
track.

“Winning six team conference
championships for the first time in over
10 years speaks very highly to the level
ofcommitment by the student-athletes
and coaches involved,"said Director of
Athletics Dee Fairchild. “A lot of hard
work went into each team's champion-
ship effort. That being said, I’m very
proud of the success that all of our
teams have enjoyed this season."
