Bedroom Politics

A Personal Opinion by Howard Horn
FR thelast three weeks, the Opinion wction of the 3&3 has been grey with
c

 

 

veryone‘s opinion on the sexual harassment workshop and what consu
tutes tape. In terms oftt legal definition ofrapc, Sarah Salter was correct
when she quoted the Iowa state law (Code of Iowa. 709.1).

Read the law. it appears on pages 8081 in the Student Handbook. Notice i
how ambiguous the law is.

The law describing rape is ineffective. Itdescribes thelaw in Iowa,but it fails l
todescnbeail actsofintetcourscin whichoncoftlie people involved feels violated.
(Byintacourscd mcanallacisofscxmpesexualabusecic.) Nolawcan do this.
norcan any pamphlet. advocatepsychiatristoranybody oranythingcan describe
this condition. No matter how ambiguous a law is, it cannot fully blanket all
situations properly. All the law can do is describe some situations that describe
intercourse where one person involved was violated

All that really matters is how people feel after intercourse. tfinicrooutse is
done between two sober, mentally mpable adults who have consented under
legitimate pretenses and circumstances, and afterwards one partner feels violate,
it’s tragic, but blame cannot be laid. On the other hand, ifthe act does not meet
the law, or cite of the partners was pessured into having intercourse, or took
advantage of a person by using power, etc, this action is inexcusable.

That’s why simple common sense should dictate bedroom activity. Don't
take advantage of the situation. Get consent. If you don'tbelieve no means no,
ask a mend time. If this doesn'twork, you should ﬁgure it wasn’t meant to be.
Don’t take advantage of the siuiation. Pitt yourselfin their shoes and tltink about
how they feel about the siuiation. If you don't exercise common sense, the
situation could be tragic.

look at it this way. How would you feel if after an act of intercourse, your
partner felt bad about the situation, or worse, felt violated oriaped? How would
you feel if you were accused of rape and had to pay for a lawyer, go through legal
proceedings, and/or g0 tojarl? Remember, the law is ambiguous. Was it really
worth it? t

Being falsely accused ofiape is horrible. Yet. unless the “victim” lies, this i
is usually not the case. The accused may not feel he or she is guilty, but the fact '
is he or she is responsible for exercismg a gross kicking ofcommen sense.

I have a [riend who was taped. No consent was given, and violent torce was
used. Yet Ihepel'peuatorwill not atlrnitgutlL This may be hard foryou to believe,
butI don'teventhinkhe feelsguilty. She feels“asifpanot‘mehadditxithatnight
Sometimes I wish I were dead.”

Does my friend’s Situation meet the legal definition of tape? Most people
would say yes. This IS unimportant What is important is that my friend has been
damaged so greatly that no words that I could rypccould doanyjustlce. Had the
perpetrator exercised common sense, this destruction of a human life could have
been prevented.

rape is much different due to the nature
and circumstances in which the crime is
committed.

Suppose one man shoots and tells

the law has not been broken. How does
the court make that dctcmrlnaunn? It
examines the facts (being in your own
living room, instead or his when you
killed him for example) as well as the
killer's state of mind (did you intend to
defend yourself or did you just want to
shoot him?)

How does this process work with
