Student Government Association candidates

We asked each of the candidates
to write a short statement to publi—
cize their campaign for SGA office
next year. The specific question was
”What do you hope to accomplish if
elected?" Judge for yourself both
fromwhat we have printed here, and
from what the candidates say in their
statements of intent posted around
campus, and vote on Match 6 in the
post office or outside the dining halls
during meals.

President
Lisa Alexander:

If elected as SGA president, I
would address and put into action
any and all ideas that the student
body thinks are important. I would
like for Dining Services to be re—
formed, beginning with not requir-
ing students to have full meal plans if
they live in dorms. I know the im»
portance of diversity and space on
this campus sol would also like to see
these issues move from discussion to
action. I would also like for ACE to
continue to be more receptive to the
diverse tastes of the student body and
one of the ways that this can be
accomplished is by having the entire
student body become more active in
SGA.

Brett Broge:

As President, I would work with
the administration to enact the ideas
expressed in my statement of intent.
The Tnistees, in particular, must re—
spond with action to the call for
space by the multi»CuituraI students
before the campus empts into dem—
onstrations, While serving on the
Gtinnell city committees I would
implementprogtarnswhichbolstered
town-gown relations and created a
safer, friendlier environment for stu—
dents. The President should make
Grinnellafunandenioyable place to
go to school, and I am the candidate
with the most experience and capa—
bilities needed to accomplish this
task.

John Chodacki:

SincearrivingatGrinnell,Ihave
been an active member of SGA. l
have been instrumental in changing
many policies that restrict your free—
doms as students. This semester, I
have been appointed to a special

es' current policies.

Commitment is my priority. I
will represent the Grinnell College
student body and change the system
to work with you and for you. I am
prepared for this position. I have the
experience and the willpower.

within the past week, l have

had to leave campus to tend to a
family emergency. I hope that you
can look past this unforeseen inci—
dent and see that I am committed
and prepared for the position of SGA
President.

Jeetandet Dulani:

Proactive. That is the best way
I can describe both my character and
campaign.

Iggy Perillo:

My goals as SGA president are
to LISTEN to your concerns and
take them seriously. Together we
can THINK of workable solutions
and goals. I am not afraid to ACT on
decisions that are made. I am an
excellent listener. we all can think.
and I am willing to take action on
your behalfro get things done. lam

James Rechs:

Throughout this academic year,
I have served as an active SGA Sens
ator and spent a great deal of time
interacting With other members of
SGA. Doingthishas notonlyled me
to the realization that self—govemanoe
is alive and well on this campus, lsut
ithasalso helped me to become aware
of the vision that Ed Brands, Dorian
Shager and others have brought to
SGA this year. This vision is one of
a student body that is not afraid of
discussing issues openly and candid»
1y; even those issues which intimi—
date many of us.

All year long, the SGA cabinet
has gone to great lengths to encout»
age Senators to start talking. Now
it's time to get everyone talking; be—
cause without valuable discussions
in which all sides of an issue are
presented, no progress will be made
toward mutual understanding. This
is the direction in which SGA has
begun to make great strides, and if
elected as President, I promise to
continue to push SGA in this direc—
tion with a fierce, undying enthusi—
asm.

Hamid Rohilai:

Myreasons for ioining the SGA
Presidential run ties with what I ens
deavor to achieve ifgiventi'ie oppor—
tunity as president for 1996—1997
academic year. Student involvement
and participation in the various is—
sues on campus have to be encour—
aged and systematically mobilized.
Issues relatedto multiculturalism and
ancillary demands of the number of
ethnic and minority groups on cam-
pus must be given particular atten«

tion. Other issues, such as security,

other issues have to be given their
due attention Finally, the welfare of
the student community remains pat.

Rupin Thakkar:

InorderforanSGA President to
effectively address student concerns.
and assure them a voice in the poli—
cies of our campus. they must be in
touch With the needs ofthe student
body. As your President. l would
periodically attend meetings of as
many campus organizations as pOSSi—
ble. This would give me the opportu—
nity to continually be aware ofwhat
the student body is working on and a
chance to heat comments and ques—
tionsftom all facets ofstudent life. In
addition, I would strive to better re—
lations between the college and town
by helping clubs which the high
school and College have in common
collaborate on community projects,

VicevPresident
Eric Baker:

I am running as the candidate
for change As I have stated before,
I am not a careerSGApolitician and
would like to change SOA so that it
is not run by a few fat cats who decide
the govemment‘s agenda. A few
ideas that have been advanced are
reducing the meal plan to 5 weeks by
cutting out the worst two weeks and
using the most popular meals twice.
This would let students eat more of
what they want Without havmg to
spend money elsewhere. I also be—
lieve there should be hard ice cream
at every study break This seems to
be a popular idea. The consensus on
meals would be reached by a mail
poll. As head of academic affairs, I
believe more people want a say in
theirdepartments‘ matters. Butmost
people don‘t even know who their
SEPC I5 or what an SEPC is. As VP,
1 would require communication be—
tween SEPCs and their maiors to
keep those students who want to be
involved informed. This is a part of

Trevor Potath:

One of the big things that I am
running on is my ability to listen to
student concerns, develop accept
able measures by which to address
those concerns, and work within our
system ofsclfgovetnance to achieve
acceptable results. I feel that l have
more ilion demonstrated this alnlity
through my involvement with
CSHealth For example, in an effort
to better reach the student body, we

have restructured the way in which
we communicate with it, [using as a
model] a very successful program at
SmithCollege entitled“HealthThy—

currently in the bathrooms are iust

In addition, we will hang folders in
