(131/ 11. W. Mtlllack

The program given in Hel'rlckChapel
last Saturday evening by the Alice Nl€l~
sen Operatic Concert company (a pair
derous title, but justiﬁed) will live in
the memories or those who were so ion
tunate as to hear it as one or' the
rare musical events or our history. To
many it was, as tar as it went, at revela-
tion or the application of music to (ll'av
rustic utterance; to others. an echo ot
the delights of grand opem and opera
outta, from which time, space. and the
high cost of living keep us all too
widely separated. It was moreover fl
unique musical event, in that, through
the pantomimic instinct ot the Latin
race, even a deaf per-son got his
money's worth; ior ii not a iiote'ot the
music had been audible, the expression
and gesture of the singers would have
been a ouite sui‘iicient entertainment.
But to hear the art or singing glori~
ously exempliﬁed by men who belong to
the race in which song is almost as
instinctive as speech. and which has
been supreme in the lllAstel')’ oi vocal
music tor more than ﬁve centuries, was
an s. erionce long to be remembered.
The singer-s, altliorigli accustomed to
audiences ten times as large as ours
song with as much icrvor; and power
as though they were on the boards of
Lit Scaia. ‘

Whole Company Is Strong.

To speak particularly where there
was so much or riniiorm excellence is
unnecessary. For especial commeudar
tion we uould all agree on Mai-douse,
who is one oi the great bassos or the
present d- ii mice of magniﬁcent
power and l‘lllllless, destined to atlilevo,
