Symposium discusses diseases

Epidemic

CONTRIBUTED BY ANDREW GREENLEE

The fear of contagious disease often occupies
headlines and news Channels, from major pandemic
threats like SARS and avian ﬂu to recent outbreaks
of mumps and a highlypublicized case of the bubonic
plague in Los Angeles this past week.

Some of that talk came out of the news and
into the Forum South Lounge this past week as the
Rosenfield Program in Public Affairs, lntcrnatonal
Relations and Human Rights hosted a symposium
called "Challenges Presented by Emerging Infectious
Diseases" from Tuesday to Thursday.

Specific topics ranged from the devastating 1918
inﬂuenza epidemic to a microbiological perspective
on the use of antibiotics to fight disease to biological
warfare.

Wayne Moyet, Political Science, is the director of
the Rosenﬁeld Program. He said that this symposium,
the last ofthe year, had been “brought more ofthe sci
ence people out" than the usual public policy-focused

The role of the news media in covering epideme
ics was also addressed in the symposium. Meyer said
that while the symposium emphasized the danger of
pandemics, the news media usually “oversimplify” and
“sensationalize” stories about disease. “They pick up
the worst possible case [of a disease]," Moyer said,
though he said that sometimes oversimpliﬁcation can
help communicate dangers to the public.

Dr. Jon Tcmte ot’the University ofWisconsin gave
the Thursday night talk on a topic that has dominated
headlines recently—avian ﬂu.

“Avian ﬂu exists out thcre,”Dr.Temte said,“but no
one can tell you whether or not it's a threat to people
in this country." ,

Abigail salyers from the University of Iowa dis
cussed the role of vaccines in fighting disease on
Wednesday night, and Moyer said that her discus
sion of bacteria mutation stuck with him. ”It's sort of
like an arms race out there,"Moyer said. “I'm not sure

With 262 singles on campus, students weigh the Odds

Roam draw, cont. from p. 1

will only house people committed to substanceefree living.

Interest in substance—free housing seems high,with 85 students
signing up for the separate room draw. There are approximately 120
beds in the two dorms, and any spaces not ﬁlled by the special room
draw will be given to firsteyears. Signing up was nonebinding and
there is no way of knowing exactly how many students will actually
participate in substance—free room draw. -

The question ofsingles on campus is always a source ofanxiety.
Masta said that Student Affairs doesn't have “hard numbers" about
singles. Based on the posters outside the SGA offices, there are 262
singles: 91 on south Campus, 140 on North Campus and 31 on
East Campus. Loose Hall has 41 singles, Read 25, Younker 33, Note
ris 26 and Kcrshaw 13.

Masta noted that every yeilr she has been here at least a handful
of rising sophomores get singles. “They are usually Norris closets
left over," she said.

In previous years south campus rooms have gone more quickly
than those on North and East campus. A potential wild card this

year is the new Campus Center, where all on-campus dining will be
located next year. Dorms like Loose, Younker and Lazier, close to
the campus center, may be in high demand.

Another new factor with room draw this year is the return of
themed ﬂoor draws. Cowles Third will host students interested in
Classics while Haines Pit is the ‘‘Health and Wellness Floor.”

Usually, any rising senior who want a single will get one. Claire
Tyndal '07 buys into that despite it high number, 1,194. As a stand-
in for four friends currently studying abroad, she hasn't made any
backup plans in case she doesn't get the singles she’s hoping for, She
plans on living in Loose Second, which she describes as “the shit
location for singles,"with 18 on the ﬂoor.

For rising juniors and sophomores, there is no guarantee of get-
ting a single. Mike Rogowski '09 was assigned 23 for his room draw,
and decided to do a ﬂoor draw “I probably could have gotten a sine
glc but I didn’t want to live in Norris," he said. “Doing a ﬂoor draw
wasjust a lot less stressful.”

Murray has given up on a single, but is still worrying. “le kind
ofa stressful process,"he said. It doesn't make up my whole life, but
I do think about it a lot.”

environmentalism

This week, two Grinncll environ‘
mental groups have joined forces to
bring Earth Week festivities to the
campus,

Earth Week, which started last
Monday, April 17, and continues until
Earth Day, April 22, is a time for the
campus environmental groups to cel-
ebrate a year of hard work as well as
raise awareness of the issues they advos
cats and recruiting new members into
the fold.

Free the Planet and the Environ-
mental Action Group have operated
separately on campus for years. This
year, they have tentatively merged, with
EAG operating as a subsidiary of FTP.
The merger has gone very well, though
it is yet undecided whether the union
will be permanent.

Earth Week this year falls during
prime gardening time, and so Friday
has been designated Garden Work
Day. other events include several mov-
ics, such a documentary on world water
policy, and a community cleanup,

Caitlin Skinner ‘07, coileader of
EAG and one of the organizers of
Earth Week, said that everything is go—
ing according to plan this Earth Week.
“We environmental groups have a his
tory of remaining pretty chill about
these events. What needs to, get done
gets done.”

Jennifer Jordan, Environmental 23c
Safety Coordinator of Facilities Mans
agemem, praised the job done by FTP
and EAG in organizing Earth Week
She said that this year's Earth Week
was particularly important, because of
coming campus environmental initias
t'tves such as the proposed wind energy
plan.

Dems bring early
primary to Forum

In past elections in Grinnell, students with free
time and motivation walked to City Hall or Fairv-iew
Elementary to cast their ballots. For those on the
Democratic side of the political spectrum, hm Friday
will bring a more convenient method of voting.

Though the Democratic primary for 2006 state
elections isn’t until June 6, after most students have
left for the summer, the Campus Democrats set up
Grinnell as a satellite voting site on April 28. Demo-
cratic voters will be able to cast their primary votes in
the Forum from 9 am. to 4 p.m.There is no satellite
voting site for the Republican primary

Voters will chose candidates for the House of
Representatives, governor, secretary of state and sec-
retary of agriculture. The gubernatorial primary is ex-
pected to be close, with five candidates listed on the
Iowa Democratic Party's web page.

campus Democratic leaders expect several hun—
drcd students, faculty and town residents to vote in
the Forum, Voters can register at the site, because
voter registration is allowed until 10 days before an
election and the ofﬁcial election date is June 6. “There
is no other requirement than showing up," campus
Democrats co-leader Hannah GardenrMonheit '08
said.

The upcoming election will force some wouldebe
voters to choose between registering in low or in
their home state. Campus Democrats Ceslcader Chase
Martyn '07 said that lowa was politically a more im-
portant state than most others. “You can make more
of a difference here," Martyn said. “Primaries have a
low turnout in general so anyone who does vote, their
votes matter."

In recognition of the importance of Grinnell stut
dents in primaries, two Democratic candidates for
governor are planning on visiting campus this week-
end. Ed Fallon will be in the Forum this Saturday at
12:30 pm and Mike Blouin will visit Sunday evening
at 7 pm.
