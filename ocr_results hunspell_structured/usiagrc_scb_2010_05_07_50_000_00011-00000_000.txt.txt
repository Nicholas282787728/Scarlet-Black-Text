Keep community events green

\Ve would first like to thank everyone who took part ill
planning last weekend's Selah celebration. Members from all
areas of the Grinnell community crime to e oy great food, en-
tertainment, inflatables, ii petting zoo (_ and a beautiful
clay. The fun in the sun got us thinking that Grinnell should
host more outdoor activities. Selih was obviously too expensive
to replicate often. but Crinnellians would appreciate outdoor
events even on a much smaller scale,

However, if Giinnell hosts more outdoor activities we
would love to see more available water. There was water pro-
vided along with the food until 2 pm, but people were outside
in the hot sun all afternoon.Though students were able to get
into dorms to access water fountains, community members en.
joying the festivities were forced to buy water from vendors
Besides the lack ofwater and sunburns many people were [0(-
ing the next day, there was one obvious drawback to this day of
fun—come Sunday Mac Field was littered with the previous
day’s debris,

Grinntllians are normally fairly environmentally conscious
and traditionally clean up after themselves within a reasonable
time frame. However, this party was not thrown by any one
clear group, which meant that clean-up responsibilities could
not be easily assigned. we feel a signiiicant amount of this
trash could have been avoided by simply placing more garbage
cans around the field. especially around the inflatables where
they seemed to be noticeably absenta Also missing was any sign
of a recycling option, a wasted opportunity for an event heavy
on plastics.

we love the idea ofbringing Grinnell’s sense offun to the
outdoors, we just hope for future events to keep out hydration
in mind and bring our green conscience along.

An open letter to the Grinnell Col-

lege campus community

I am Jeff Pcdcrscn, Interim Head Football coach and Intel“
im Head Women's Track coach here rit Grinnell. I rim it 2002
graduate of Grinnell and my wife is a 2001 graduate. Both of
us loved our time here as students, and have returned here to
work and to raise our growing family. As you all know, a very
disturbing incident took place this past weekend; an incident
involving a number of football plriychrI am deeply sorry for the
pain, hurt and concern felt by many of the women on or con-
nected with this campus as a result of this incident. I am still
not fully aware of the extent ofwhat was written about some
of these women, or who was written about, but suffice it to say
I am close to many of them and it is difficult to see what they
are going through.

The main point ofthis letter is not to talk about what hap
pened, which is a matter for campus judicial processes, but
rather to talk about how we can move forward from this. I hiive
always wanted to be a coach that places as much priority on
developing intelligent and thoughtful men and women as I do
on developing a successful team on the field or the track, Even
though the incident was not limited to football players. nor
was every player on the team present, we are prepared to move
forward as a team to face up to this matter. we can not undo
the damage that ms done, but we will move forward, striving
to be an asset on this campus, not a detriment to it. We want to
be the embodiment of this school’s ideals, not the exceptions.

We are prepared to take the necessary steps to accomplish
these things, beginning with accepting whatever punishment
is handed down from the College Hearing Board, as well as
any ramifications for the team.The first step is to better edus
care ourselves on avariety ofissues pertinent to this campus. I
would hke to work together with several groups on campus, in-

Creating a safer community

The evening of Saturday, May 1 will set a precedent at
Council College for many years to come. The offenders ufa
biasunotivared incident are widely known. Their punishment
and response could change many aspects of Grinnell College
life Due to the level of this case, we hopC all

i ved realize the importance of the de-

cisions they illC about to make.

The thought of every woman on
campus wondering whtrhcr her name
was slandercd and if so. in what way. one
rages every member of this staff. A hid-
eous concept for a party at the expense of
members of our community can never be
justified, Understandably, some individuals come
to Grinnell with less experience than others in recognizing big
otry, though that lack ofcxperience cannot be cited as rationale
for oppression. Ignorance does not excuse hateiignorance re
quires education and adaptation by the freshly informed,

The core Grinnell values are clearly presented in every col-
lege guide, pamphlet and website page that carries the Grinnell
College name. Presumably those responsible had some idea of
what our community expectsiwhich in most cases is not much
more than an elementary respect for one’s peers; if for some
reason they did not, they had at least nine months to learn, II
is completely unacceptable mat in early May those responsible
still somehow manage to trip over that low bar of expectation
and claim benign ignorance as the cause, Whats even less acr
ccptahle is Grinnell’s perpetual acceptance ofsueh a lame ex-
cuse. It's time to put a foot down and make an example our of
those responsible. lfwe dent, we let them trample everything
that makes our institution exceptional and get off with a simple

team will also work with DVA/SAC to determine an appropriate

The next, and perhaps most important step, is to help foster
dialogue on this campus. I beheve we will better understand the
ramifications of the incident by speaking openly wrih our fellow
students and colleagues. I believe we will learn more by speaking
openly with members of all different campus communities, and
I want to be a leader in this. I would like every mcmbcr of this
campus to know that I am more than willing to speak with them
about this incident or about the best ways to move forward. My of-
fice is located in the Fitness Center, my phone extension is x3824,
and my email address is pedersej@grinncll.edu. Contact me at any

once again,1 am truly sorry for the pain caused by this incit
dent, and sincerely hope we can move forward and create a stronr
get, more unified campus.

Thank you.

Another side of the debate

The party that happened this weekend is indefensible. Iun-
dersiand why people on campus are upset about the events oflast
weekend. and I feel for the people who have been hurt. However,
the response to the party, and the subsequent demonizing of the
football team, has been unfair Many see this issue as it cut and dry
instance ofhatred and bigotry, but the reality is far from that.

Many athletes, especially those of certain sports, feel pigeon-
holed into a certain cohort of campus society from the moment

shrug.

Defenders may claim that one should not condemn the
group fora few of its members, yet this leads to an endless Line
of blame, from the party goers to the party organizeis to the
environment in which the party organizers were raised, Some
one must step forward, take blame and accept the punishment.

Beyond that, claims or a hypocritical re-
sponse by the community are simply
wrong. we, as a community are re
spontling to a private event thrown
by a group that fostered bigotry that
would never be allowed by the comt
muniiy as a whole,

The few who still defend last

weekend's event ask for additional time,

patience and understanding as the respon~

sible patties assimilate into the Grinnell culture and learn

Grinnell values. This is an illogical plea for a simple reason:

the systematic degradation of other people for amusement is
not a Grinnell specific Value.

In order to prevent incidents like this in the future, we hope
new measure will be taken involving social justice training to
the entire student body, Possibly, one or two tutorial periods
could be devoted to this crucial topic. Additionally, we hope
that the college continues to support and expand programs,
such as the Ajust spring Lra'tning, that bring in outside experts
in social justice training to educate a group of students. This
process helps build a strong system of peer education for the
future of Grinnell. We hope that though much damage has
been caused by this egregious misconduct, the good coming
from changes instituted from this point forward will surpass
these acts of injustice.

that they set foot on Grinnell soil. Their cultural backs
grounds are often very different from the atmosphere they
have been thrust into at Grinnell. For example, before
college, I had never interacted with a gay person, African
American person. or Hispanic person, Simply by definition,
it takes a person from a background like mine time to adjust
to Grinnell.

One would think that a community such as Grinnell
would be tolerant, patient and understanding oftht: difﬁcult
tiesna‘ssociated with the transition many athletes are making.
Instead, athletes and football players in particular tire ostra-
cized, The raised eyebrows when a muscular male actually
contributes to class discussion. the changing of walking trar
jectory and lowering ofgazes when a football player passes.
the flat-out denials that football brings any beneﬁts to the
campus; we notice it all. Much of the rhetoric concern-
ing this issue has focused on “the campus community." For
many of us, this community does not exist; we were never
offered a part in it. and have been very clearly excluded.

In the cultures that some football players come from,
words like misogyny feminism and heteronormativity are
without tangible meaning. As such, the party that happened
Saturday did not raise any red ilags for some participants.
The words “violently sexual" have been used to describe the
events of the party, but anyone there would contend that
sexual violence was not a part of the equation. The party
was seen by some as an opportunity for friends to get [0*
gethet as a group, a time to hang out and consume delicious
Jell-O shots. In other words, a party with many similarities
to the countless others often held on this campus. Some
aspects of this party crossed the line, but please believe rne
when I say that myself and others meant no harm. Clearly,

people are upset, and rightly so, and for that
Iam truly sorry. see p. 12
