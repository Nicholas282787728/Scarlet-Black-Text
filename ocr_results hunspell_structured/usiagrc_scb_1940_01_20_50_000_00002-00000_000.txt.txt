WHY NOT SATURDAY?

Monday through Friday, we may climb the
stairs to the third floor of the music build
ing and contemplate the virtues of capi-
talism, Andrew Carnegie, and the phono»
graph. Monday through Friday, we are also
as likely as not to have the opportunity of
being exposed, despite the presence of a
supposedly solid wall, to the viitues of John
Philip Sousa, the snare drum, and the Grin-
nell Spirit. No wall, we learn, is so thick as
to shut that out. But Mozart, never having
heard of the Grinnell Spirit or even of John
Philip Sousa, made no provision for de-
fending himself against their existence, and
sadly picking out the strains of the Qualtet
in D Major we admit that his defeat is fore—
ordained. With Tschaikowsky it is another
matter; here even the snare drums cannot
quite dispel his thunderous onslought. So
we trudge down the stairs reflecting that
this is after all a world of conﬂict, and pity-
ing equally the snare drums and the un-
suspecting Mozart. So on a snowy Saturday
afternoon, freed from immediate assign-
ments, we climb the stairs again, stubbornly
clinging to the groundless belief that by
some accident “Monday through Friday”
does not exclude Saturday The snare drums
have been silenced, but Carnegie door is
locked. Annoyed by our successful self-
frustration, we go to the Dixie to gulp a
coke and listen to Glenn Miller.

Monday through Friday, we may climb
the stairs to satisfy our esthetic appetites.
Why not on Saturday?

DIAGNOSING THE EDITOR

Reprinted from the Daily Dartmouth
College men are generally presumed to think
pretty highly of their own opinions, but of
all college men, those most likely to believe
themselves capable of settling great affairs
with absolute finality are the group which
edit the college paper.

For all we can discover, very few people
have ever said so in print, though the Vox
Populi columns have called us some other
things. Bret Harte wrote an article back in
the last century pointing out that with all
its advantages, a college paper could be a
great strain on a man’s time, and so far as
we know, no one has ever snapped him up
on that issue. But that fault is nothing at
all to the confidence which college editors
are likely to have in the vast public im—
portance of their own opinions.

College editors are willing and ready to
speak the last word on education, economics,
world diplomacy, ethics and moral standards
of their fellow men, football, baseball and
basketball, the doings of the President of
the United States, women, Fascism, Nazism,
Communism, Socialism, the C10, and AFL,
and anything else that may call for expert
knowledge during a six day week. They
can make an issue out of anything and once
having stated an opinion on one of the above
subjects, they will defend it to the last ditch
College editors never admit that they are
\Vl‘Ol’lgr

Of course it takes a goodly amount of
sheer nerve to sit down before five or six
columns of white space every day and rattle
off the solutions to the college’s and the
world’s problems in time to catch the reserve
desk open, Men of less experience would
quail at the thought. But the college editors,
faced with the necessity of saying some-
thing every day, get used to it, and after
awhile, it is not particularly difficult.

Nevertheless, when you think about it,
it seems almost impossible that any group of
men could have so much knowledge on so
many different subjects.

It probably isn’t necessary to tell you
that they don’t. Except that we think it‘s
a good idea for them to announce it publicly
once in a while, just to keep themselves
from thinking that they do,

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“For the moment the attitude of our aca—
demic youth seems to be so largely self‘cen-
tered that one doubts whether the form in
which pacifism was brought to them during
these years was the best for their spiritual
health. The young men today seem to be
largely concerned with safety first and the
old men with $30 every Thursday. Peace
that is not the crown of justice and liberty
is a peace that cannot last, and it would
have been more inspiring if our young men
and women today had been more concerned
with justice and liberty than with their own
safety.” President-emeritus William Allan
Neilson of Smith College chides collegians
for their stand on the affairs of the day.

Small Audience

age, came out on the stage of
Herrick chapel last night and for
over an hour held a small audi-
ence of students, faculty members
and town people enthralled by a
superb exhibition of musicianship.

The abundance of empty seats
gave mute evidence of the large
percentage of the student body
that was unfortunate enough to
be "unable" to attend.

For an audience that was small
enough that it might be termed
“select” Elsie Haggard Ryan, pia-
nist, and Elias Blum, organist,

Miss Morini, who finished the
master course at the Vienna cone
servatory at the age of eight,

success that she gave six addition-
el concerts in Vienna the same

long tour of Europe.

Coming to the United States in
her early teens, Miss Morini made
her debut in Carnegie hall with
the New York Philharmonic or-
chestra. After several seasons in

Germany, Russia, Austria, and
Australia.
