CONCERT TO BE IN CHAPEL

Many Numbers Which Choir Sings
Originally Written To Be
Given By Orchestras.

Tlle Russian ' Symphonic Choir
which will appear here at eight o'clock
Monday evening in Herrick chapel has
received many flattering tributes on
its first American tour One of the
most remarkable criticisms accorded
this unique organization was by the
Boston Evening Transcript, which
'wrote as follows:

Singing Beyond Bolicr

"The singing last evening lwas al-
most beyond belief, It was not the
'periodic or sporadic rise and fllll, the
continual ebb and flow of a normal
chorus, but the subtle and marvelous
(lection of a complex and living are
gall, Mr. Kibﬁlchich has made It pllr»
‘ticular ‘study of the humming tone.

/ the tightrlipped headstone. and the
rounder sonuritles of the full-throated
bass, It is in the daring and origi al
employment at these that a shifting
’brilliance of the vibration mimes the
the legato string or the chuckling piz-
zicato, Nor must there he the most
imaginative mind to fancy the piouaut
oboe or the dry and biting bassoon."

Indeed. it needs little imagination
to hear the various instruments of the
orchestra in the individual voices of
the Russian Choir. Mr. Kihalchich se-
'lects his voices with careful regard
to timbre and his frequent use of the
hummed tone creates the illusion of a
human orchestra. Very often the
bass accompaniment resemble closely
the percussion section of the orches-
tra. Sometimes one can clearly dis—
tinguish the saxophone, the 'cello, the
muted violin.

Arrangements Arc Dining

The programs of the Russian Sym-
phonic Choir, as arranged by Basile
'Kibalcllich, its director, contain a
good my musical numbers which
.were originally written for orchestra
for piano and which he has ably ar-
ranged for his chorus. Some of this
arranging might be called daring, if it
,were not done so masterly. But it
took a great deal of courage on the
part of Mr. Kihalchich to arrange for
his choir an excerpt from the Slow
movement of Beethoven's immortal
ﬁfth Symphony. He did it only be
cause last season witnessed world-
wide celebrations of the composer‘s
One-hundredth Death Anniversary,
and this was the only way Kibalchicll
could pay tribute to the great master.

The Grinnell ele’vrl was battling with

of a 19 to 0 defeat in 1927, powerful
in the confidence given by a victory
in the opening grime, strong in the
knowledge that star players, out in
that contest were back in the game,
threatening with the foot that Bradley
had overcome his scholastic knockout
with a last minute examination and,
above all, grimly determined to carry

With the coming of the House Moth-
ers to the Men’s Dormitories a some-
what cnlarged program of social life
For the men and women of the col-
lege has become possible, While the
\Vomen’s Quadrangle will remain the
Banter of the social life, there will be
definite times when the club rooms
will be available for sociitl affairs un~
der the chaperonage of their hostess-
es.

The most important innovation
which has been agreed upon has to
do with exchange dinners on week
ends. on Friday nights Quadrangle
women may invite men to take dinner
with them at the Quadrangle, and on
Saturday nights the men may extend
the same courtesy to their lady
ri-iends. This will be without expense
to the students, provided those cone
cerned are regular boarders at the
dormitory or the Quadrangle. in all
cases or such exchange dinners the
women must arrange for their guests
with Miss Smith by Thursday night,
and the men must arrange for their
guests with Mrs. Thompson and their
own House Mother by Friday night.

When young womcn go to the dor-
mitory for dinner it is understood
that they will be presented to the
House Mother in whose hall tllelr cs-
cart in g, llnil that only the dining
room, the club room. and the House
Mothe s parlor 'will be open for CI]-
tertainment. The hours will be lilll~
itcd from 5:30 to 0,

As a tentative arrangement tllc
House Mothers have agreed to act as
hostesses on Friday evenings to any
couples who may wish to use the club
rooms for visiting. It is understood
that there Will be no dancing in the
club rooms, and that no other rooms
will be open to guests.

on tilts coming Friday evening, as
well as all other Friday evenings

Faculty Says No Classes Will Be
Held Saturday; Rail Rates In
Effect Over WeeksEnd.

According to a ruling or the faculty
there will be no class metihgs Satur»

' day morning, October 13, which is Lhe

annual Homecoming celebration, but
there will be the annual Homecoming
chapel service at ten o'clock. This
is one of the features of the day. The
speaker has not been announced as
yet.

Tile freshman football game on the
field in front of the dormitories will
follow immediately after the chapel
service. This is one of the numbers
on the program that is especially in—
teresting. The program bl events will
he announced in tile SCARLET AND
BLACK next Wednesday.

For the first time an organized
group will have charge of decorating
the buildings and campus. In former
years it has becmcustcmary for each
building to provide its own decorative
scheme. It is thought that this will
be more effective.

While no special rates have been
announced by the railroads for the
event, it is understood that the spec-
ial week-end rates on both the lines
are in effect. This covers a period
from Friday.llntil Sunday night.

Homecomings at Grinnell were in-
augurated several years before the
World War. In the upheavals caused
by the war, Homecomings, like many-
other customs, were interrupted, but
for the past five years the reestab-
lished Homecoming at Grinnell has
grown rapidly in prominence and inc
tcrest until it is now one of the big
autumn events not only of Grinnell
college but of the whole state,

Tradition calls for a big football
game as the central feature. Grim
hell's adversaries on the occasion of
homecoming have been either Ames or
Drake. These institutions have res
clprocated by making Grinnell the
guest at their own homecomings.

A Homecoming is guestrday.
the guests are the graduates mid
friends of the two institutions, and
the parents and friends of the stu-
dents, It has been the practice at
Grinncll to invite all visitors, no mat-
ter what their colors are, to take part
in the events. On that day the college
declares “Open House," and Anles'
colors as well as Grinnell’s scarlet
and black will fly from the same
heights. .

work between Des Molnes and Grins
