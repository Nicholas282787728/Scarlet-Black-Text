ln Memorlam.

In June 1900 the class of '97
held its second reunion and re—
joiced in exchange oi greetings
and messages of a still unbroken
circle. A week later came the
newsof the death of Abbie Willett-
Snook, on June 14. at Silver Cliff,
Colorado.

When Abbie Willett left college
it was her purpose to give herself
ultimately to missionary work in
the ioreign ﬁeld, being pledged as
a Student Volunteer.

A partial failure in health made
it necessary for her to seek the
climate of Colorado. In the fall
of '98. she was married to Rev.
Snook, who gave up his pastorate
at Woodbine, to establish a home
in Colorado.

Thcn followed a busy, happy
year and a half of home mission-
rary work in the mining regions
near Silver Cliff. As health and
strength returned to Mrs. snook
she gave herself unreservedly to
the needs of her husband's people,
and her training and natural
ability' rendered her a true help.
meet.

In college life Abbie Willett
had a distinct place of her own.
though her manner was always
quiet and unobtrusive. She always
stood for high things and her very
personality was a real influence in
all the student circles.

She was deeply interested in
the Student Volunteer Movement

 

and was ready to follow in the
work to which Hester
Hillis, gave her life.

About Abbie erlett's religious

Minnesota-Grinnell Game.

For the ﬁrst time in seven years
Iowa College was defeated by
Minnesota by a decisive score.
The ﬁrst half was anybody's game,
but in the second half the Come
bination of a team outweighing
the Scarlet and Black 40 pounds
to the man, and aﬁeld as soft as
plowed ground, proved too much
for Giinnell and she was forced to
submit. to defeat.

Minnesota made her ﬁrst touch»
down in 5 minutes, but for the re-
mainder of the half honors were
even and the ball seersawcd back
and iorth‘over the center of the
Field, the half ending with Minrier
sota's ball on Grinnell’s 40-yard
line. Minnesota tried a place kick
just before the half closed but
failed miserably. Thih half was a
revelation to Minnesota. The
plays she had used so successinlly
on Chicago were stopped without
any trouble by her- pigmy oppo-
nents, and in spite of the immense
weight, Grinnell‘s center hold like
a stone wall. Grinnell's playing
all through iar outclassed her op-
ponents and Minnesota retired to
the gymnasium to consult with
Doctor Williams in no very hope-
ful frame of mind. The eighteen
hundred meters assembled in the
grandstand and blenchci‘s showed
their disapproval oithe way things
we’re going by maintaining a si-
lence which would have been quite
becoming to them had they lived

during the Stone Age.
Although Minnesota was aided

by a strong wind, Grinncll gained

at every exchange oi punts,

 

through Minnesota‘s slowness and
inability to handle them. In the
second lizrlf the wind had died
down so as to be of very little as»
sistance to Grinnell. The half
closed with a score of Minnesota,
5; Grinnell,0.

In the second half both teams
started in desperately. Minnesota
kicked off 45 yards and Fislie re-
turned thc ball so yardsby a bcaur
tiiur run through the entire ’Var‘~
sity. Minnesota was repeatedly
held for downs and both teams
puntcd continuously. Finally
Minnesota worked the ball to the
25-yard line and made a place-
ltick. Scorc. 10 to 0.‘

Long line bucks and a rgyard
run around left end gave Minne-
sota another touchdown. She
tried a print out biit failed. Score,
15 to o.

Aiier several exchanges oi
prints, Fellows recovered the ball
on Minnesota’s ftimble and Foster
madc [5 yards around left end.
Minnesota tlicii recovered on
downs and carried the ball to the
10-yard line, where she was held
and Grinncll punted 20 yards.
Minnesota then slowly worked
the ball over for a touchdown and
succeeded in kicking goal. Score,
21 (0 0.

Clarke kicked off 40 yards and
Minnesota made steady gains
through the line and rverrt over

Grinnell kicked off 40 yards,
and recovered the ball on a fume
blc on Minnesota’s zgryar'd line
and tried a place-kick which was
blocked. Time was called just as
darkness was beginning to tall.

Grinrlell played a hard, desper-
atc game against terriﬁc odds. All
the men tackled desperately and
viciously and seldom missed their

soft, heavy soil made Gl'innell al-
most as slow as Minnesota. Baggs
played a magniﬁcent genie at

an adept at dodging and returning
