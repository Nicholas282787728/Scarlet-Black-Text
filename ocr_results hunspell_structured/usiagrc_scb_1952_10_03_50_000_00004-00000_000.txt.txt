Lack Backfield

The Grinncll freshman toot-
ball squad, coached by at:
Booth, has been hard at work
the last two weeks in prepara-
tion for its first game against
Cornell, Oct. 25, at Mt. Vernon.

The squad, numbering 35, in-
cluding a few transfers, has
been working on T formation
plays as a basis for varsity
playing next year.

About one half of the play-
era are candidates for the back-
field, leaving the line short
handed, Some backfield players
will probably be converted into
linemen.

Besides the Cornell game, the
frosh will play Coe at Grinneli

Grinnell’s Pioneers met their
second straight defeat of the
season Saturday at the hands
of a strong Lawrence eleven,
2876.

The Scarlet and Black's only
touchdown came in the fourth
period as a result of a Lawrence
fumble. John McClintock plugr
ed over the goal stripe from one
yard out to climax a 35syard
moi-ch. Lawrence, however, scor-
ed oncc in every period to total
ltheir 28 points.

i .. ONCE AGAIN, the Pioneers‘
‘passing left much to be desired
as three of the ten passes at-
tempted were intercepted.
! Adding a bright point to a
dark story was coach John Pfit~
sch's statement, saying, “I think
that we played as good a game,
I not better, as we did against
\Coe." To balance this, he added
that Lawrence had the “best
offensive team" that he has seen
in five years of conference ball.

the Yankees topped Cowlcs 1270.

also met Clark in a clash today.

Jiin Kinglond scored three
touchdowns and was instrumen-
tal in several others as Gates
riddled an impotent Clark squad
with numerous passes. The as
points produced by Gates far
surpassed the scoring efforts of
the other seven teams combined.

Bennie “Killer" Jones, used
two long pass plays, one each
in the first and last quarters,

In a loosely played game
Smith and Langan fought to a

game because the timekeeper
failed to stop the Clock during
the last two minutes of the
game when the ball was dead.
During the rest of the game the

for time outs, but the rules are
different for the final minutes.
The intramural board met today
