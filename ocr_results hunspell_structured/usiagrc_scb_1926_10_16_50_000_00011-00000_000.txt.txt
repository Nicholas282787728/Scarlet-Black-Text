Apparently the first Grinnelllon to

‘ For The “Pink"
Further excavations reveal the fact
not football was introduced here in
389,. The gridiron sport then ran to
lass play. Padding was almost nu,

the moleskins fought not for the

so find upon thither perusal of these

3 feet, the high kick went to 3 feet
