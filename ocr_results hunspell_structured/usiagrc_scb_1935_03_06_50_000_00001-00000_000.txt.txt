Three Systems

of Rule Offered
U. S. A - Wood

,America is reaching a point where
she must choose between fascism, com.
munism, and democracy, Paul S.
Wood. professor of English, said at
vespers Sunday, Outside of these sys.
tems," he declared, “everything is as
dead as feudalism.”

Democracy exists today only in the
United States and the self.govcrning
parts of the British empire. Both
fascism and communism are openly an.
ti.democratic, Subordinaling the inter.
ests of the individual to those of the
state, Professor Wood said.

He stated that there is no freedom
of speech or the press in either Ger.
many or Russia, and that courses in
German universities are being arbi.
trarily regulated and shortened to give
longer vacations in which students
may serve the state, “I should not
dare to give the name of my informer,"
he said, “for fear of iniuring that per.
Sm'l.u

Democracy must be puriﬁed by
clearing away old ideas, if it is to sur.
vive, Mr. Wood declared. Blithe also
stated that in preserving the form we
must not sacrifice the essential prin—
ciples. especially that of the righe of
the minority.

in selecting The Scarlet and Black's

Valley First Team

as there were so many players of al.
most equal ability who might be con.

All of the men among the first seven
were standouts during the 1935 Valley
campaign. Few will argue with the
selection of Mason of Grinnell, Dngel.

Tulsa for the forward posts All three
were the chief scoring threats of their
respective teams, and Larson especial.

of ability practically on a par with
that of those three men was Parisho
oi Drake. Though he played only
part time while Smith was in school
the first semester, he ranked fourth in
Valley scoring and was perhaps the
hardest man in the conference to tie
