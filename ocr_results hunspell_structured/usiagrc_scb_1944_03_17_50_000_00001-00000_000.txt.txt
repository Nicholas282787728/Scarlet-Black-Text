Ross Becomes Second

Womanl'o Head Sludenl Body:

In an election characterized by
an unexpectedly lively nominat-
ating convention, and an \inpl‘EV
cedently frieiidiy spirit between
the candidates, Gerry Ross,
Haincs junior, last week became
the second woman to head stu-
dent government in nearly 100
years of college history.

Miss Ross, who emerged as vic
tor over her hall-sister and for
mer roommate Janet Pearce, re-
ceived 170 votes in tiie [illal bai-
loting. She will take office after
spring ‘vacation.

Nomination of five students
from the original nomination list
of ten was made at the convene
tion Saturday in A. R. H. audiv
toriuni. Tiiey were .vanet Pearce,
Lucy Trowbridge, Dari Doolittle,
Doris Popple and Miss Ross. Thc
other five, Phyllis Butler, Mary
Bose Everest, Blanche Lutcha,
Joali_Mayer and Jean Beno, an'
nounced their formal witiidrawal
from competition as the meeting
opened,

Then the 1944 convention,
which had been forecast by up-
perclassnien as probably being a
lifeless affair. got under way with
enough surprises to assure it of
a place in the memories of all
present. An early highrpolnt was
the compelling speech of Macy
man Jack Hartley as he nomin-
ated the only male candidate
presented in the election.

A little German band sprang
from nowhere during the first
intermission, anti recalleri with.
nostalgic pleasure the old days of
real campaigning. circus-poster
banners, and 20-foot portraits of
candidates,

Following the nomination roll
call, the delegations were polled
to reveal the instructions of hall
and cottage resident. On this first
instructed ballot Miss Ross‘
emerged with 39 votes, but no
other single candidate accumu-
lated the 27 votes required to:
close the convention. Miss Popplc.
was second with 21 instructed
votes, while Miss Pearce com»
manded 11, Miss Trowbridge 4
and Doolittle three.

A marked difference in vote
distribution was noted after the
second ballot. which saw the
emergence of Miss Ross and Miss

News of the death of Carlton
(Hal‘pol Marks, 'ex 44, was re
ceivcd by the personnel' office
this week. He was killed in a
plane crash in Florida Saturday,
March 11,

The plane crashed and disap-
peared in a river, and no trace
of the plane or the bodies was
found. Whether Marks was the
pilot is not known. It is also un-
certain whether the plane was
just making a routine flight.

Lt Marks received his wings
and commission as a pilot in the
Army Air Forces at Biooks Field,1
Texas. iii January of this year.l
He was taking combat training
in Florida at the time of the ac-
cidcnt.

Lt Don Jacobs, Grinnell '42,
who was with the Army Air
Forces in England, has been re-
portcrl missing in action. His
plane was seen going down, but
no one was seen to bail out and
conditions were favorable enough
to attempt a landing. He is
thought to be a prisoner of war.
according to information received
in a letter from his squadron
leader to Jacob's family.

commanding 35 per cent of thei
ballots cast. Miss Ross's follow-
ing dropped to 33 and Miss:
Pearce picked up 17 votes, bring-
ing her total to 23, and closiiig‘
the convention. i

For the first time in sludentl
government history, the clectioni
day speeches were made in thei
Main hall drawing room. withi
both candidates acknowledgingi
the problems and opportunities ofi
next year, the meeting appeared‘
completely void of thc old ‘eye-l
forranreye' spirit of former years,
and seemed to do much towardi
assuring the support of a united“
student body behind whicheveri
candidate won the final contest.
