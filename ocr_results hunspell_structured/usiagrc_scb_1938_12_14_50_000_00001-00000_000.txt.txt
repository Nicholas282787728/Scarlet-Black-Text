Safety Leader
Advises Careful

Holiday Driving

Chicago, 111., pec. 14—Wsrn stu-
dents hcme for the holidays that
this is the peak period for sel'ir
ous automobile accidents, advises
James S. Kemper, nationally
known safety leader and president
of the Lumbel’mens' Mutual Cas-
ualty company of Chicago.

“Analyzing 7,241 automobile ac-l
cidcnts in the last three years
classified as serious, we found 523
were in the period from Dec. 16
to Jan. 3," said Kemper. “This
shows a holiday season frequency
39 per cent above the annual
rate. ,

“Parents should lealize that
homecoming students on pleasure
bcnt are 39 per cent more apt
than usual to figure in serious
automobile accidents at this sec-
son,“ he continucd. "Actually the
rate doubles in the last half of
December compared with the
average for December and Jan-
nary."

Causes include late hours.
drinking, had road conditions in
bad weather, and decreased visi~
bility during these shortest days
of the year.

A special studcnt hazard to be
avoided is unsafe conditions drrv.
ing home from school and back.
Typical of such conditions is a
poor car, overcrowded, driven
through night and (lay with a
relay of excited young drivers

 

Centenaridn, Former Grinnellian

Relates College Experiences

A hundr-ed-ycarold former stu-
dent of Grinnell, Mrs. Robert
Laughlin of Los Angeles, Cal., re
cently sent a letter to Pres. John
s, Nollen in which she told of her
own experiences at the college
during the Civil War.

She also enclosed a letter which
her brother, Peter Hollingsllead,i
wrote home in 1861.

While the Hollingshcads were at
Grinnell, both boarded in town and
worked part of their way through
school. Mrs. Laughiin remem-
bercd none of the names of her
fellow students at Grinnell, but
she recalled that there was talk
of the college being closed during
the Civil war, as most of the
able-bodied men were in the army.

Mrs, Laughlin left college after
three or four terms and returned
to hel‘ home in Tama County to

help her father with the farm
worir during the war.

 

Thc letter from Hollingshcad
was written on a yellow sheet of
paper dated May 27. 1861. It was
covered with graceful lines of the
old style handwriting with its
filled in “g's”, “ll’s”, and “t's”,
but it is still as legible as it was
77 years ago,

The letter differ-ed greatly from
the flippant, pool‘lyrwritten docu-
nicnts that are sent home to pare
cuts from the dormitories today.
It was respectful, reverent, and
formal.

Hollingshead told of the decla-
mation work that the boys were
doing at the time. “Some," he
said, ”did very' well, while others
broke down in the middle of their
pieces."

In concluding his letter, Hol-
lingshead apologized for his bad
spelling and said he must con.
clude as "it is close to breakfast
time and I want to have more to
