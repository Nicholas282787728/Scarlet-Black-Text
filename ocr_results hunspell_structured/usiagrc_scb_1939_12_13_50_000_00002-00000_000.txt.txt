THE GRINNELL SPIRIT-OH!

It is undoubtedly a sign of the times. Per—
haps college spirit is undergoing one of
those transitions which seem to have been
conceived somewhere in the boom, out of
prohibition, the speakeasies, the depression,
or the night clubs, and only by hindsight
become apparent. Grinnell college, despite
its heritage, reflects the change along with
other schools and universities.

We may be wrong in speaking in gen;
eralities, but the fact remains that the
school spirit, as it was supposed to be here
in the past, has undergone a decided change.
Today college undergraduate spirit at Grin-
nell is non-existent, at least in the classical
time-tested manner of the Pioneer of old.
The interests of the Grinnell student of to»
day center around such inconsequentialities
as, what show is on tonight, who was the
girl I saw you with last night, and what kind
of a football team will Iowa have next year.

To an observer of any activity here, it

is plain that the idea of a Grinnell spirit is
now pure fable. We see no showing of spirit
at athletic contests; the home performance
of the football team this year was equally
lacking; it was learned, by a recent survey
conducted on this campus, that the average
strident at Grillnell does not know or care
who ruiis the different campus activities and
organizations; perhaps one-sixth of the stu—
dent body attcnded the college band concert
recently; and down the line of campus extra-
curricular functions tllis lackadaisical attie
tudc prevails.

It has become typical of Grinnell college
students to assume an implied pose of soph-
istication—that of superiority over the
once»upon l-time spirit that has been
thrown into the discard. Grinllcll has been
noted as the school of ladies and gentlemen,
and we must confess this is still true—in
the feudal sense of leisure

All of this is fact; however, what is the
conclusion to the argument“.7 Quite frankly,
we don’t know exactly the cause or the end,
and as a result have no constructive pro—
gram to offer. We feel that Grinnell’s ob-
vious trouble is no different from that of
other colleges. Our belief is that the trou-
ble here is part of a. whole picture of tile
decline of collegiate spirit. Whether this
disease started at the top or the bottom of
Grinnell’s academic structure, we are not
prepared to answer, but this much We do
know: both the top and the bottom of Grin-
ncil as an organization are infected with
this transition, an attitude which seems to
say, “Move over and let me sleep,”

cousnrnMiWw

This month’s title and commendation for
the lnost constructive organization on the
campus goes to the Men’s Honor ‘G’ club.
To it goes the credit for turning a mere in—
itiation into a constructive campaign, iii
this case taking the form of gathering food
and clothing for the poor. Nor did the club
leave all of the work upon the shoulders of
the initiates; instead, new and old members
alike participated in the campaign

In addition to canvassing the homes of
Grinnell for contributions of food and cloth—
ing for the poor, the club gave the student
body a chance to participate in the worthy
cause by presenting a play, “Creation," the
admission to which also consisted of arti-
cles of clothing and food.

The llet result of the whole drive was
over three thousand cans of food and five
large barrels of clothing to be distributed
by county welfare societies.

Again we say congratulations for spon-
soring an unselfish, worthwhile project.
