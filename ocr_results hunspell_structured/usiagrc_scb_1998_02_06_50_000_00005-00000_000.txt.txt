Don’t Ask Me, I’m Just a Girl Letters

BY Ltzz WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

Okay, here's the deal. If you see
anyone who is planning on going
abroad any time next year, give them
abig hug today, Especially after five
o'clock, unless, of course, they are
already face-down drunk in celebrar
tion of completing a series ofessays
that attempt to explain why he or she
must leave Grinnell to avoid going
crazy next year and knocking people
off from the top of Burlilig with a
sawedroff shotgun, while still man-
aging to make him/herselrsound rcA
sponsible and endearing. Endenring
is important because then the selec—
tion committee may feel bad if that
individual does not get to leave Of
course, there is always the scare lac»
tie that could involve telling each
committee member that he or she
will be the ﬁrst to get “taken care of’
when said shotgun is purchased and
Burling is climbed,

But that‘s not what my application
is like because I really am respone
sible and endearing and have a lot of
background for the program. IfI get
to go to Holland next year the whole
school will benefit from my new
knowledge of Dutch culture and its
relation to the construction of sexur
ality, identity, and gender. And
maybe I’ll get to do one of those pree

sentations at the Forum OI ARH for
which my name is writtcti on n cole
ored piece of paper and hung up in
the loggia (only to he loin down in
drunken misbehavior litter tltat
night). At this presentation I Will get
to delnolistralc to the school (and
supercool committee members who
Itllink nre tcnlly ncnti how wonder»
ful going to Amsterdam was for me
and how I niatutcd and learned a lot
and stuffthat I can‘t wait to iiicol-poe
rate into my Grinncll experience as
a whole. Also, I will show how I
deﬁnitely could not have had such a
positive undergraduate cxpcrictlcc
tvitliout it. And when I'm a rich and
{nitrous uluinui I wtll look back at my
Grilincll years with n generous nae
ture as I think about how much I
learned wliilc studying across the
ocean, all tltc while using my Grille
ncll training to bring honor and re-
spcct to the school while on the pro
gram, And they'll get to scc
EuroLtzz next spring, a girl seen only
but once during Halloween of last
semester. Euro/sic: is iii no way [If-
filiaied Willi Euro/)l'slley because
Disney is evil, So, before I change
subjects. if you are on the comniite

_tec that Will dectdc my fate (and p05.

sibly your own) I Wlll quote the
Smiths for you, “please please
please let me get what I want "

I guess the Smiths' quote is still
appropriate for my next subject. the
upcoming holidlty a week il'Om Sate
urday. This holiday is the source of
grief for many students at Grinncll,
especially those of us who don‘t need
to be reminded of how much our
lives resemble that of Charlie
Brown’s . not getting any on Febru-
ary 14th . candy, ﬂowers, bottles of
whiskey, or crack from a “loved"
one, Valentine's Day sucks. I hate
Valentines Day. It's just a plot by
Hallmark and FFD to make me sad
and lonely. Really. isn‘t it bad
enough that it‘s cold out and many
ofus suffer from seasonal depression

as it isl And February is a crappy
month anyway . the snow is always
gray, the sky is gray, the soul is gray,
everything wants to break free but
knows it has to sit still for two more
months before the sun even comes
out in the goddamn sky for more than
an hour a week . And then you have
some stupid Wking holiday to tell
you that you are all alone in the
world. Ofcoul'se, many will attempt
next Saturday to find someone spe-
cral and there Will be some sort of
booty rush across the plains, And
then everyone will sllack up and
wake up the next morning with a ter
t-ihlc hangover and elnpty feeling
because the one night stand was not
as emotionally, physically, and Splri»
tually fulfilling as the individual
originally expected and intended,
And maybe it will be and the rest of
us will have to watch your stupid
little “I‘m in love and everything is
great" bullshit until spring when the
booty rush will again appear.

Ifyou are offended because you are
in a happy couple, I’m really sorry.
I‘m so happy for you. I didn’t mean
to upset your perfect little world,
Candy makes you fat. Flowers die,
Unfortunately, according to 1h;
m, these are some of the only
acceptable gifts a woman can get
from a man on this wondrous of
wolldctftll holidays. Beware men,
because ifyou are dating aRulcs girl;
she will break up With you if you
don’t buy her these wasteful objects
that supposedly express your desire,
If you are, in fact, dating a Rules girl.
beware because the engagement ring
is supposedly the best gift of’all.

And, finally, I will have an advice
column next week to answer all of
your romance questions for
Valentine's Day. A stupid column
about f**king love and goddamn
romancejust for you! Get your subs
missions to the SBLB, Box V—5.

Dear Campus Community,

Ours is a critical semester in
Grinnell’s history, Beyond the press-
ing importance of a presidential
search, we’ve just completed a tran-
sition in the dean's office and are
beginning one in the registrar's of—
fice. These changes are pushing all
of us to evaluate Grinncll as both an
institution and a community. Discus-
sions of what Grinnell is and how it
could be better abound among the
faulty. administration, and tthrust-
ees, As students, we need to take a
leading role in that discussion as
well,

In order to discuss our school, both
its present and its future, we have to
continue to improve the ways in
which we Communicate. In ouropin-
ion, Joint Board could be a highly
effective conduit for information,
ideas, and strong opinions to be
ashared.

Last semester, the SGA senators ac»
complished a great deal. Through
Joint Board and committees, SGA
brought discussion of the Grinnell
presidency into Joint Board and into
the hands of students, pushed for an
outside evaluation ofdining services,
increased student parking on cattle
pus, implemented a policy for the
new lock system, ensured increased
student access to new computers in
Burling, began discussion ofthecol-
lege calendar, and continued to lobby
unfailingly for multicultural space on
campus. Undoubtedly, these accomv
plishments certainly help increase
the quality of academic and social
life on campus. However, an equally
important achievement of Joint
Board was its two lengthy discus—

OPINION

to the Editor

SIOnS of how to make Joint Board,
SGA, and campus a more informed.
more efﬁcient, and better communi-
cating place to live and learn.

We have a lot of ideas. Some of
these will take shape today when the
SGA president and vicevpresidenl
discuss with the Board of Trustees
the need for more involvement and
communication with the student
body But the bulk of our ideas in—
volve more participation and dia
logue among students in general.
We'll do our part to ltlcrease aware
ness ofSGA activities Within the stu
dent body, but for Joint Board to be
turned into a successful forum for
student communication (which we
sincerely hope it can), it’s going to
take more than SGA senators to ac
complish it. True communication
wtll require more attendance when
we talk about important issues, dis-
cuss the Joint Board minutes and the
S&B at Hall Council meetings, It
will rchlre the involvement of stu-
dents living off-campus in on-cam-
pus dialogue.

Due to sclfrgovernance, Joint
Boardiand this campus#are really
what we make them. This semester,
SGA Cabinet’s first goal is to
strengthen communication and
awareness. We ask for campus sup-
port and participation in achieving
this goal.

Tales From
Another World

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

I like when it snows.

I like to watch as things are now
cred up, and the ground becomes vir-
gin again, waiting for me to make my
first mark.

I like the individuality ofthe ﬂakes
falling, No two are the same > I‘ve
been hearing it since earliest child-
hood when I dashed about in the win-
ter park trying desperately to exam»
ine the flakes, looking for their
marks.

I like to catch the flakes and feel
them melt into my hand reminding
me of what mortality is and that any
second the ﬁre of existence might
melt me down to a new form.

I like to watch as dogs dig through
the‘cold With their noses, seeking the
scent which was once there, looking
for what is familiar in an unfamiliar
world and all the while wagging their
tails.

I like the way ﬂakes drift to urte
known destinations, how they are
given to the wind, how their lives are
not made of choices but are the ride.

I like how they travel from atmo-
spheric existence, where their parts
bonded to form the whole of the in»
dividual flake. to the frozen ground
where they bond with brother and
sister ﬂakes to form that blanket, so
slnooth and beautiful and uniform,
the blanket sewn from all those free
ﬂoating individuals.

Iremember long psychedelic walks,
crunching through the unbelievable
splendor of this newly fortned earth,
and how each footstep tore a giant
chunk. Iremember how Idreaded the
approach of morning and sunshine
and the restoration of the eanh.

I remember New York City and
how the snow was slush before it hit
the ground. The city extends so high
and far it can corrupt you before you
realize you've arrived.

I like to sit by the window in an
aware daze watching.

I like to watch it ﬂoating down so
gently, waving and spiraling across
the sky, falling like cotton. absurdly,
but beautifully, like so many of the
kind friends I have, who follow their
lives to smiling tragedy.

I like the captivating quality that
demands that we ask “How long?
How much?" and that keeps boys
wondering “Will there be school to
day, or can I be free?"

Snow as the liberator, the eraser.

Snow as emptiness.

Snow which arrives and brings a
new surface to the earth. creating a
world which has not been explored.

I like to be free; I like to stare at
aendless acres of blank white; I like
to think of the transitory nature of
this endlessness.

I like knowing that it 15 life until it
ends, ,

When I am standing beneath the
twisting ﬂakes, I know that it is the
end for the flake that hits me. I like

that it ends with a kiss
