Drug MDA Dates Back To I930’S

Questions about MDA are
welcome at the Revolving
Door, ext. 601 or 602.

First of all, it might be in-
teresting to point out that MDA
(chemically referred to as
3,4—Methylenedioxyampheta-
mine) is not a particularly
new drug. It was synthesized
in the-1930’s at a time when
psychiatrists were just begin
ning to get interested in mes-
caline and related mescaliner
amphetamine compounds. It
was then thought that these
drugs might show some pres
mise in the treatment of epilr
epsy.

The first report referring
to the investigation of MDA in
human subjects was made by
Loman and his colleagues
(published in the Transactions
of the American Neurological
Society, V0167, 1941). In this
paper the authors described
the inducement of rigidity and
muscular stiffness in one case
of Parkinson’s diseasewithan
unspecified dosage.

Interest lagged until 1957
when Alles resurrected the
drug and ran a series of clin-
ical trials with obese patients
in an attempt to describe the
subjective psychotropic pro-
perties of MDA. He made dir-
ect comparisonsbetween MDA

and amphetamine at dosage
levels ranging from 60 , 120
mg., and found thatthe thresh-
old for real subjective central
effect was about 60 mg. al-
though he found neither the
change of moodnor sleepless-
ness that is characteristic of
the amphetamines at dosages
as low as 10-15 mg. At the
highest doses (120 mg.) Alles
observed distinct visual and
related sensory changes (such
as increased auditory sensit'
vity and alterations in peri-
pheral vision), butnohallueim
ogenic effects were noticed.
Recently, due to its alleged
appearance on the illicitmarr
ket, interest in MBA hasagain‘
revived. Reports have been
circulating around the country
for quite a while that MDA was
a potent hallucinogen. In a re-
cent effort to ewluate theact»
ual psychological and percep-
tual effects of MDA, two
STASH Consultants, Dr's.
Claudio Naranjo and Alexan-
der T. Shulgin, administered
the hydrochloride salt ofMDA
orally to eight normal volun-
teers, all of whom had had
extensive experience with LSD
and other hallucinogens. Sus—
pecting that the doses given by
Loman 'et a1. and Alles had
been on the small side, Drs.

Naranjo and Shulgin gave their
subjects up tolSU mg. ofMDA,
fully expecting that the drug
had a “potential forproducing
changes in affective mood and
mild depersonalization” as
well as visual distortion.

in spite of their expectations
that MDA would be a hallucin"
ogen, none of the eight sub‘
jects reported hallucinations,
perceptual distortions, or
eyerclcsed imagery, all of
which are very common reac-
tions to LSD, psilocybin or
mescaline. Yet, these investir
gators have reported a similr
arity between MDA and LSD.
Their subjects stated thatboth
drugs had brought about an
intensifimtion of feelings, in-
creased perceptions of self
insight, and heightened em-
pathy with others during the
experience. Most of the sub
jects also reported an increa-
sed sense of aesthetic enjoy-
ment at some point during the
intoxication (the experiment
was conducted in a relaxed
and sensorally "supplement
ed" setting , i.e. music, art
prints. etc).

As with mescaline, LSD and
most other psychoactive hal-
lucinogens taken orally, the
”rush" came about 40 , 60
minutes after ingestion, with
the effects peaking at the end
of 1 1/2 hours. For the ma
jority of the subjects the ef-
fects persisted for about 8
hours. Unlike “speedy"drugs
the experience was character
ized on‘the whole as an “ins
ward one" with most subjects
focusing on their own life and
personality. Neither tan MDA
be classified as a ”psychoto-
mimetic” (an agent which
“mimics psychosis") for the
perceptual phenomena, d9,
personalization, or disturb-
ances of thought which char-
acterize these substances
were also not present.

Drs. Naranjo and Shulgin
have concluded that this drug,
to a certain extent, is in a
class by itselfandare investir
gating the possibility (since it
produces an “inward, talky
experience") that it may be of
value in the facilitation of
psychotherapy. Contrary to
many rumors, MBA is not
chemically a mixture of mes-
caline and amphetamine. It is
a compound in its own right
which is related to both mest
calinc and the amphetamines.
This may partially explain the
lack of “speedy” effects ex-
hibited by MDA.

Transient Statement Reviewed

by Mark Sablemm

President Glenn Leggett's
policy statement lastweek re
garding transients on campus
apparently came in response
to a general desire on Lhepart
of administration, some studt
ents, and some townspeople
for a statement of intention
,and a method of dealing with
those “uninvited or unregisr
tered visitors" who abuse the
freedom of Grinnell as an
open campus.

The policy, which states that
the college will ask civil auth—
orities to escort transients
off campus in cases where it
is ”reasonably clear" that
they are bothering ether stud-
ents.

President Leggett, Dean of
Students Conney Kimbo, and
Ric MacDowell,assistant dean
of students, became concerned
about the problem of trans
ients on campus earlier this
year due to the increasing
number of attempted assaults
on female students, and com-
plaints from students about
overuse or abuse of college
facilities bynon-students.The
President has also received
some complaints from towns-
people who would like the coir
lege to keep their sons and
daughters off campus unless
invited.

Well, the record promorers
are at it again, trying every-
thing to make some extra
cash. They just came up with
another brilliant idea. Jesus
Christ Superstar has been ma-
king them a mint. So what did
they do? They released a re
cord by the same two co-
authors and made sure every
one knew that the record was
done by the same “creative
mlents that composed Jesus
Christ SuperStar." The trick
is that this ”new" recordwas
actually recorded aboutayear
before they wrote Superstar.
Yes, it‘s another Bible story.
The name you won‘t believe.
They decided to equal things
out, so this story is from the
Old Testament, and it’s called
--(ready7)~ Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dream
coat. It’s a single disk, telling
the story of Joseph, die lucky
brother of the twelve sons of
Jacob who got this multicol-
ored coat and somehow event-
ually became second-inr com-
mand t0 Pharoah in Egypt.
(I’m mking it for granted that
you know the story prettywell
and I don't have to go into
detail.)

When you listen to this re
cord, you can hear where
Superstar mine from. (Unlike
Supersmr, it's not a realrock
opera, there are just differ
ent singers telling the story.)
Joseph . . . is not too bada
record, but it's nothing like
Superstar, lacking Superr
star’s fantastic drive and em-
otion. Too much of the music
in Joseph . . . is repetitious
and singsong. Also, this re-
cord lacks the numberofgreat
musicians of all types who
appeared on Superstar. Most
of the music of Joseph . . . is

The policy has not been put
into use since it was issued
laSt week; some ofthe visitors
who had been specifically ob—
jeeted to left at the time of
spring break.

Complaints about some of
these individuals, a number of
whom were former students,
were from other people in the
dorms the visitors werestay-
ing in. Apparently one former
male student who stayedwitha
friend in a women's dormitory
monopolized the shower on the
floor.

Another visitor regularily
visited Grinnell on weekends
during the fall semester, and
took over the kitchenette in
the dormitory he was staying.

Last semester, there were
often so many transients stay-
ing in Younker Lounge that
students in Younker were often
unable to use the lounge.

Sometimes, a large number
of visitors on weekends also_
results in problems for stud-
lents. According to Ric Mac-
Dowell, there have sometimes
been so many visitors at dan-
ces and folk concerts thatGrr
innell students found it diffi~
cult to get in.

Although the newpolicywould
not directly help in all these
situations, MacDowell told the
5&8 that he hopes the policy

sung by one David Daltry,
backed by a children's chair.
There are a few guitars, tr-
umpets and a violin here and
there.

It is hard to listen to this
record without feeling it is
tongue- in* cheek. There is one
song where the Pharoah tells
Joseph his dream, and it
sounds like Elvis Presley sin'
ging a rocking melody from
the 50's. The lyrics do not
seem to be too serious either.
When Pontiphar’s wife wants
Joseph to make love to her,
he sings, “Please stopl Idon't
believe in free love." And
when Joseph saves Egypt from
the seven-year famine, the
lyrics are equally light. "Ser
ven years of famine followed,
Egypt did not minda bit/The
first recorded rationing in
history was a hit!”

On the whole, this record is
not bad. It is pleasant, inter
esting listening. If you like
Superstar, you may find it
fascinating to see how itevol’
ved from this first Biblical
rock record. (In fact, there are
a few places in Joseph . . .
where the music is the same,
note for note, as a passage in
Superstar). But if you are
expecting something as pow-
erful as Superstar, you will
have to wait. Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Roam-
coat just does not nl‘e it.
