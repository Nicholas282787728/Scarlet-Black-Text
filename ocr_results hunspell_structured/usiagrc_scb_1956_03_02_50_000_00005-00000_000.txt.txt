With the strong possibility that they can capture
their third consecutive conference championship, Grinuell’s

swimmers traveled to Cornell

this weekend to defend their

coveted championship. The meet started today with the

finale taking place tomorrow,

Many of the observers feel
that. Grinnell’s chances are as
good this year if not better than
in the past years to retain the
crown. The reasons behind such
an observation are due to the
fact that the tankers are vastly
improved upon entering the con-
lerence meet as compared to
their earlier encounters this sea-
son,

Secondly the conference has
two other very strong conten-
ders in Carleton and Knox. This
factor Within itself suggests
that Grinnell does not have the
pressure upon itself as was the
case last year when the Pio-
neers raced through the season
undefeated,

Deeds speak louder than
words, and so it is with coach
lrv L. Simone's tankrnel-l. in
their first dual meet the Pio-
neers lost two Nebraska uni-
versity. Later in the season the
tankers outapointed a strong
University of Kansas team which
had previously beaten the U. of
Nebraska.

Also coach simone has added
tour new swimmers to the team
which should give the team a
great deal of added strength.
These men are Tom Hejrla,
Dick Rufer, Steve Rogers, and
Jack Herman.

The outstanding factors that
point to a Grinnell victory are
entrenched in the tankers fine

Stubbs, the outstanding Pioneer
swimmer, is expected to chalk

The Pioneer finmen, in their

Stubbs remained unbeaten ‘by

Other strong features of the

team include the 440 yard re-
lay team composed of stubbs,
Bob Carothers. Sam Petroff,
and Charlie Hawtrey. nod Mad-

first place honors in the diving

Co.captain John Marsh with
Tom Heina will provide more
strength in the back stroke
event.

All in all the facts add up to
a very promising outlook for
the Grim-tell tankers, but as
coach Simone stated, “This
year’s conference meet will be
