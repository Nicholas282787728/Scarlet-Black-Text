0 Basketball Express.

What with wars and battleships and such
happenings this week to command our ale
most exclusive attention, we’re likely to for-
get the battle about to take place at home

Regardless of what else is going on, to
night our basketball team is taking the
floor against a highly rated Lawrence out»

fit. This is the first home game, you know,
and there is no better time for the stu-
dent body to unite solidly behind the team
for a roaring sellfloffi

As far as conference games are cone
cel'ned, tlle fir t one is as important as
the last: if we get a running stall tonight
the battle is hal ii. The Pioneers have
been practicing hard, and deserve our supr
portiand then some Come on out tonight
and let off a little steam—let’s put this one
in the bag!

“Patriotism.

Outbreaks of ”patriotism” have been occur—
ing all over the country since Japan at—
tacked Pearl Harbol-i

The beautiful and famous cherry trees
in \Vdshingtoll which were presented to
us by Japan over 20 years ago have been
damaged by a mob.

In East St. Louis, Japanese—illade silrcr
Christmas bells were taken down from the
town's holiday decorations and burned pub-
licallyi

During the blackout in Seattle, riots
broke out and rocks were thrown through
plate glass windows of stores which had
left small night lights burning.

We cannot help but feel that if such
energy and ”patriotism" were directed to-
ward Red Cross work or some part of the
All-out effort, it would be far more help,
In] in our objective of winning the war.

I hostcncd to apologize, but the
phone was dead. I 'fclt deeply
sorry for my dastardly statement.

with a burdened soul. I arrang-
cd tlic picture successfully
hour later. I had no cause for
complaint. For I had been grant-
ed permission to have the picture
taken.

I feel like a dog; honestly I do.

The irreverent and distinctly re»
bellious thought occurred to me
later that a fire or something of
an urgent ncturc would have to
burn a long time to have its pier
Lure taken in the quadrangle.

But naturally I put this thought
away iinmdcioleiy cs unworthy
of my contrite spirit,

”Mine not to reason why; inine
lint to do and die," I soloccd my-

an-

self as I wandered lonely as an
isolationist zbout my tasks.

I rcapoat, for the rccord, that
I rccl like a dog. I do. Like a
dirty, dirty dog.

told myself ﬁrmly; I cannot dally

I asked for Dr. Stevens, and I
was told to hold the line.

I held me line, I held it well,
glowing pleasantly with the Chris-
tian thought of duty well-done.

Din Stevens answered. I

explained my case. All I

wanted to do was to take

a picture of five girls in

the quadrangle, which lay

not two blocks from my
path.

I was told to call Miss Gardner
at the quadrangle for further sp-
proval.

By this time, though my normal
outlook is extremely optomistic,
I was becoming discouraged The
picture was to be a news shot,
and I was beginning to fear that
it would be too late for the last
edition this week.

I called the dean of women, but
there was a faint trace of iron in
the pure and iiiitainted soul .

I was answered by a secretary,
who said that Miss Gardner was
very busy. I was told once more
to state my case

So once more I stated my case,
not rudely, but wcurily, with all
the sadness of my thwarted perr
soxIleity creeping into my voice.
I was told to hold the line, and I
held ii. with a delicate sadness,
a thwarted weariness that was
positively Christian.

tht was my picture about? I
was nskcd once more.

With the quiet resignation of n
futulist, I mnttcrcd the story
again, wehi-iiy. I wanted a picture
of four girls in the qundrunglc. I
usintcd it taken this week, in fact,
this evening. I wanted to take it

I was told that I might take
the picture.

Sudden glsdncss and light flood-
ed my soul, my weary soul. There
is hope, I mought; there is hope
in this war-tom world. There is
peace: there is a ruling hand, a
benevolent Allmighty who strcws
blessings on his crring children.

I was glad, and happy.

I staggered. It was then that

I felt the milk of human kindness
curdle in my breast, It was thcn

replied in a tone of iron with de
