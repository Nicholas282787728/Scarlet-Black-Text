The great
plastic gun

 

controversy

Well, anti-gun legislators
have entertained the American
public yet again with their fool-
ish antics this past season, in the
process reaching new lows in
demagoguery and sheer disregard
for facts.

I‘m talking about the great
"Plastic Gun" controversy which
raged in our nation's capitol but

Matthew C. Macho

weeks ago. It all started when
'Ausuian manufacturers attempted
to sell their pistol, called the
Glock, in America. You see, tlle
Clock is an innovative pistol
utilizing parts made of polymer
(read “plastic"). This prompted
many anti-gun legislators to be-
lieve the weapon would pass
through conventional metal
detectors and X-ray machines.
Indeed, to hear them tell it, the
Glock was expressly designed for
the purpose of infiltrating airport
security systems. But as usual,
their claims were erroneous. It
was the facts, not the gun, which
remained undetected by antiagun
legislators during their debates

The gun is 83% steel by
weight (that's right. 83%). in
addition, the polymer used in the
Clock is not eray transparent.
Thus, the weapon will set off
metal detectors and show up quite
clearly on airport X-ray mar
chines.

Many are probably wondering ‘-

why someone would want a
plastic gun it it doesn‘t have the
advantage of being undetectable,
or even difficult to dctcct. Simply
put, the Glock is an excellent
product. The polymer frame is
lighter and less expensive than
conventional steel frames, and is
somewhat ﬂexible, which par
tially absorbs recoil. There are
only 33 parts in the whole
weapon, which makes it easy to
clean (it‘s dishwasher safe!) , re-

Apparently humble only to lnIi-gnn us.
Congreﬁmen, the Clock pistol can be
detected by all modern airporl security
system when operated by trained
personnel. as demonslrulrd try this X»rly.

pair, and maintain. It is, in
short, a well designed, safe,
accurate, and reliable pistol.

Many foreign countries have
registered their approval of the
Glock: It is used as a service arm
in ten countries, and hundreds of
thousands have been sold world-
wide. Yet not a single foreign
country (not even England or
West Germany, which severely
restrict handgun distribution) has
considered the pistol dangerous
due to its polymer frame.

None of this seemed to bother
the liberals in Washington, who
continued to delay distribution of
the gun while trying to get it
banned. This is because they
were not interested in protecting
airlines, etc. from an unde-
tectable gun, but getting some
mileage out of the anti-gun hys-
teria which followed their dema»
gogic attacks in the press. Anti-
gun activists have not had an
easy time of it lately, and a ban
on "Those dangerous undetectable
plastic guns ideally suited for
airplane hijackings" seemed like a
safe witch hunt on which to emv
bark,

In the end, Clock was forced
to put a metal strip on the frame
of each gun bearing the serial
numbers of the individual piece.
While this is really no big deal.
it does constitute unnecessary
meddling in business and trade,
and the debate (as lengthy as it
was unnecessary) delayed
distribution of an excellent prod-
uct for months. More seriously,
the flak Glock received may well
discourage American artns manu-
facturers from pursuing innovaA
live designs in the future, making
the luclative arms market yet one
more arena in which American
manufacturers will not be able to
compete. Intelligence must be a
rare commodity among our
highly paid elected officials.

Environmental issues

Humans must take responsible attitude toward the ecology

There is a great tree. It is
growing ever higher, ever older.
And with the growth, as always,
comes death. Leaves of the tree
dry up and fall, twigs break off,
branches topple to the ground.

A long, long time ago. it was
only a seedling, and there were few
twigs and leaves. As the seedling
grew into a sapling, some of the

leaves fell, but many

more grew on the tree. The
branches of the great tree, as well
as the twigs and leaves, were very
different from one another, for as
it grew the tissue itself would
mutate and change. As the tree

 

matured. there came to be a
countless variety of branches and
leaves of all shapes and sizes. The
breeze that always blew past the
great tree moved the branches back
and forth. up and down, and the
leaves and twigs would tap each
other, touching and separating and
touching again.

There came a time when an
averagerlooking branch in the
middle of the tree grow a leaf that
was to behave very differently
from the rest of the leaves. The
leaf grew into a palmate shape,
with five blades of differing
lengths. At times, it moved al-
though the breeze was still. or sat.
motionless, while its neighbors
fluttered up and down in a crisp
wind.

The new leaf felt, .n a delib-

 

The Human Element

Lou stood balancing on the
edge of the shingled roof, toes
hanging over the rusting gutter,
arms outstretched. He was Su-
perman this afternoon, with a
yellow and white striped beach
towel Safetyrpinned around his
neck, The gusting October
breezes caught the cape dramati-
cally and snapped it behind him.

He could look down from the 12
foot perch across the overgrown
yard, the tall grass brown and
dead in random circles, killed off
by the dog poop. An abandoned
swing set was at one end of the
yard, where vines now crawled
and twined up the chipped alu-
minum supports. He was eight
years old, to big for the swings
now--or so he asserted. But
standing on the roof was like
straddling the top of the world.
Lou knew that he was no bird, no
plane. but the Man of Steel. And
he could fly.

He did. It was a beautiful.

the crisp, autumn blue. almost to
that out-reaching branch. He

cape flapping. Then, like a
bright missile wrapped in beach
towel, he dropped, plunging to-
ward ground zero and a minimally
raked collection of leaves.

But she caught him. Some-
how, miraculously, she was there
to snatch him at the last mo»
ment, to set him down gaping,
and to shake him vigorously by
the shoulders while screaming
semi-panicked gibberish. She
spanked his butt two or three
times and sent him sprinting to
his room

That night, Lou Stimson got
an unprecedented double hclping
of peach cobbler dessert.

Mary Stimson was that sort
of mother, the kind who seemed
to possess those legendary "eyes
in the back of her head," who
would punish her only son
sternly, then figure an hour's
banishment was adequate for any

crate manner, the other parts of the
tree. It examined and remembered,
analyzed and evaluated. But
sometimes it grew so interested in
another leaf or twig that the
subject would get broken off the
tree. Sometimes the new leaf
would break a leaf completely off
the tree to use. The hand grew
larger and more flexible, able to
reach almost every other part of
the tree. At times, in moving its
immensity from place to place, it
would unknowingly strike leaves
or twigs to the ground.

Once in a while, the hand
would even realize beforehand that
leaves lay in its path, but it
always had to be moving, exam-
ining, and if a few of the tree‘s
millions of leaves fell off, the loss
was not severe. After a short

childhood crime. She was diA
vorced. a working woman. a pro-
fessional. Yet when Lou was
home, so was she»except for
weekday mornings in winter
when she'd leave early for work,
and the hunched Mrs. Bancrow
from next door would hcbble
across the snowy lawn on
arthritic joints and stay until Lou
left for school.

The bond bctwccn Mary
and Lou Stimson was as easy and
natural as any between a mother
and her son. They had anunder-
standing,

The 25 year old Lou was
hanging out with Paul and Craig
in front of the flickering neon 7-
Eleven sign, munching on a
ripped bag of Cool Ranch Dori-
tos and a Super-Big Gulp of
Coke. He had on the slashed
black leather jacket that his ex-
girlfriend had given him. It danr
gled chains off the sleeves, which
chimed wamingly as he walked.

They all were such jackets"
and jeans. They pierced their
ears, and raced their black, dusty
hogs down dark roads in the early
morning hours, weaving between
the broken center lines. They
ruled this side of the tracks. the
broad, striped backs of writhing,
dim-lit streets. Hating this town
that was a snake pit.

A shiny white van pulled up
in front of the store. They
watched intently as the vehicle's
headlights shut. off. No one
stepped down. Craig tossed his
half-eaten, pink snowball out on
to the pavement of the parking
lot, where it exploded in a shower
of crumbs. A smear of chocolaty
cake had dried on the edge of his
lower lip with a whitish film of
saliva. A loose wrapper rattled
across the lot, skimming the oily
patched blacktop, touching down
only briefly before being gusted
and swirled away.

Paul was talking about his
asshole boss at the lumberyard.
By now, all of them had lost in-
terest in the white van, from
which muffled music was beat-
ing. It was one a.m., and little

time, however, it was so large and
uncoordinated that the leaves of
the tree began to be knocked off
continuously. The new leaf
realized that it was harming the
tree. but it still continued,
unknowingly or uncaringly, to
defoliate. And it had grown so
large that at times the entire tree
seemed to lean to one side or
another in response to its
movement.

The tree is an earth-tree; the
branches, twigs and leaves are the
classes, the families, the species
of life that live there. The hand»
leaf shows the human race in its
frequent role of environmental
exploitation. Often, we are aware
that such a problem exists, but we
don't have full knowledge of the
situation, or we ask the all-too-

 

traffic had passed. Then, the
three of them heard the thump,
and they turned to look at the
van. It was rocking, swaying
violently like quick, convenient
sex. A few minutes later the
motion stopped, and a clean-cut
guy, shirtless, climbed down
from the driver‘s seat and stag-
gcred drunkenly into the store.
Lou, Craig, and Paul swung on
to their motorcycles, kick-started
to simultaneous roars, and swung
close to the van. They pounded
their fists against the metal sides,
howling and making catcalls,
while the vehicle vibrated from
the force of their blows. Then.
peeling away,
they leftclouds of heavy dust and

Lou sat on the creaking front
stoop of his house smoking a
cigarctte. Swan-n5 of moths bat-
ted themselves senseless against
the dim porch light. A car's
headlights crawled down the street
slowly, as if looking for a
turnoff. When it neared, Lou saw
it was the same white van that
the three of them had terrorized
earlier that momingr It was now
three am. The vehicle pulled up
into the driveway, and the long
side door slid open. Mary Stim-
son stepped down, shut the door
behind her, and turned back to-
ward the house. Trudging for-
ward as if exhausted, she mounted
the lowest step and slowly eased
to a seat next to her son.
Accepting the profcrred cigarette,
she lit up and took a deep drag.
Neither spoke for many long
minutcs.

Finally, Lou patted hcr gently
on the knee and asked, "How was
work."

common question, "What can I do
about it?" There are always steps
that can be taken to improve our
relationship as individuals or as a
species with the earth.

Recognizing the interrelation-
ships between species and their
necessity to human existence is
the first step toward forming a
longrtcnrt, stable ecology on this
planet. And with this recognition
must come a willingness, or even
a strong desire. to commit oneself

to these goals. During the
semester. this column will present
controversial environmental issues
of current interest, and suggest
what we can do about the
problems.
