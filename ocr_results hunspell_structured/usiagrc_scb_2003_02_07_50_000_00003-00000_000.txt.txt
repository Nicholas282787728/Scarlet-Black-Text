Concerns

There is some coiiccrir among rhe faculry rhar
rhe lack ofdara perraining to teaching dispropor—
rionarely hrrrrs iunior srarf members, This concern
comes ar a horn when iuiiior
faculty salaries :tt Grinncll are
already lower rharr average
when compared to peer instie
muons.

According ro ‘01202
school year srarisrics, eired by
Monrgomery andsupplied by
Carol Troxsct at the Ofﬁce of
Institutional Rascurch, uscise
rarrr professors at Grinnell are
earning compararively less
rhnn choircounterparrs ar peer
institutions. While fuu praise
sors at Gtinncll can-1 [01.4
percent of peer salaries, and
associarc professors earn 100.6 pcrceirr, assistanr pror
fessors carn only 92.8 percent ofrhe average salary
ofassisrane professors at peer insrirutions. The per.
cerrrage for assisrant professors is rhe lowesr it has
been in rhe pasr four years.

Because reaching is nor a factor in dererirrirrirrg
merit—based raises, the Budgcr Commirree relies only
on scholarship and service when calcularirrg coin-
pensarionrhis, soiiiesay, tends to disadvanrage itin-
ior taeiilry, According io Harrison, while many as
sisranr professors are prolihc scholars, they are dis
advarrraged on average because of she rinse it rakes
to produce a book or other stable <cholarly contri-
burron. Since scholarship is only considered by the
Bridger Committee in the year of its publicarion,
ihe rcivardworrld likely go ro someone later iir their
career.

In addition to the delay lIIVOthLi in SChOlﬂl’Slilpr
assisranr professors are as a disadvairrage because they
aren’t assigned to as many difﬁcult comrnlttccs. “The
college culture i-ighrly rries to avoid loading
unreiiurcd people with too nrueh service," Monte
gomcrywrorca rccenr memo ro the faculry. bur such

According to AxlloldAdclbcrg. Math and Com-
puter Science, trying to iugglc all ot‘rhese responsi-
biliries can be a challenge for new professors. “If
you’re a young person, its very hard, The pressures
are harder and expecrarions are harder, You have re

Suggestions

Each year‘s Budget Comrrurrce is different and
sets its own criteria for determining mcrltebucd sal—
ary increases. Consequently, there are future possi—
bilirics for including reaching iir mcrlrebased raise
decisions. Ideally, according to Adelberg, a combo
nation ofdara such as studenr evaluations, profssor
visirauons and a portfolio would be used. He also
suggested making berrer use ofriie evaluations come
ing from deparrmenr chairs.

Mobley suggested that rhe relative weighr given
to reaching, scholarship, and service vary depending
on where a faculty member is in his or her meat.
For example, emphasis could be placed on service
for full professors who are more frequently chosen
to chair commirrees, teaching for assrsraiir prefers
sors in their ﬁrst few years, and
scholarship when professors are
reaching tenure and need it to
be promoted. “ltyou't: iudging
associate, full and assistant pror
fessors by exacrly rhe same cri-
teria, rhar doesn‘t seem to make
alototsense to me because we're
at different stages in our can
rcers." Mobley said.

However, many faerrlry be
lieve rhar making assistant proa
tcssors' salaries more compae

rurions would require more

drasric measures rhan just in»
eluding reaching evaluations. “1 don't know any face
urn/who rhink iusr facroring in reaching will bring
assisranr professors salaries [to] or above rhat orour
peers," said Harringron. What would work, he suge
gescr, is an aerossrheboard raise

Reflecting college values?

In addition to rhe problem ofiunior faculrysala
rics, some sraif are concerned that she Budget Com»
mittee is sending mixed signals. “lfwhar you're judge
irrg your raises an is scholarship, then that gives the
idea to rhe people who receive the raises thar xcllol-
arslrip is what is important," Mobley said, “and there»
fore reaching will go down because scholarship is rhe
rewarded one,"

According to Mobley, rhis isn't an intentional
message, because at Grirrirell teaching is acnraily ml
ued more. “1rwe’re going (0 have a merit system,
and most people seem ro Want [that], the merit needs
to be based on whar is rhe most important aspect of
a professor's duties. And ifGriirircll rhinks char reach
ing is most important, which 1 believe most people
[do]. then that's what we should be rewarding,"
Mobleysaid. “And we nced to redevelop the system
so that teaching can be evaluated well enough so rhar
it an acnrally be looked at and rewarded."

Skcrrctt agrees rhat ehe contradiction between
the college’s values and how rho college determines
meritebascd raises is iror intentional. “1 think the
current siruarion is anomalous," Skerren said. “Bur
if it persists. Griirnell faculty are not dafr and will
reorganize their priorities accordingly"

The 8&8 talks with librarian Gail Bona’lh about Burling’s catalog problems

What systems went down?

The tatalog and electronic reserves. Databases and indexes couldn't
be accessed from on campus [because of] problems with the proxy
server.

What happened?
This started last Tuesday, the 28th ofJanuary. The power supply on
the CPU went bad We did various troubleshooting, and ourvendor
.. sent us the replacement server. We installed it, and the server
was back up for awhile on ihursday nan. 30]. then it went down
again. After that, we had multiple hardware failure:. The disk drives
crashed, and the tape drive wasn't working properly. Our data
drive and the operating system were corrupted. We do not know
why. libraw Support Technician Sheryl Bissen worked all weekend
,. trying different combinations oi disk drives and cabinets and
cables and so on and so forth, trying to get the system back up and
running. Nothing worked. By Monday morning, baslczlly they
had done everything they could do, and we’d done everything we
tould do, and they sent a technician out with all new hardware for
our system. he's got all the hardware installed npht now, and

he's reloading our databases. We may have lost some data, but
we knew that might happen [so we] kept track of the work we did.

is this kind of thing unusual?

It’s been really exciting. We've had this system since 1939. Sinte
1989, we've only been down one or two days. it's always been
because of hardware failures, not software failures. This IS reall ,
really unusual. I’ve never heard or anybody being down this long,

How did you cope with the downtime?

I hope that we've been alile to make accommodations for people.
Searching the catalogerererence librarians have been showing
people how to use Wurldtat to search. it's a really great backup
to have. We have a little circulation program on the PCs, so we’ve
been able to keep track of check-ins and checkeouts. Electronic
reserve: weren't accessible at all, but we still have paper topics of
those.., atthe circulation desk. We hope it never happens again.
We're really sorry, We worked as hard as we could. We hope people
weren’t too inconvenienced. We tried to provide alternative ways
to get information.
