mESTERDAY mornings

chapel talk was devoted to
offering a few suggestions upon
ditterent subjects, among which
was the use ot college proper—
tyin the library. Not only are
the periodicals mnltllated by line
derlinlng different passages as
was stated by Pres. Main, but in
some cases even the library books
are treattd in thesame way. Clipr

the exchanges and newspapers,
This treatment ot college proper»

severe censure. It is taking adr

notice exceptsornc wouldrbe wag,
changes it or adds something
which may have an element of
wit in it or may not. to stu
dents sllqultl know that tht: pros

per place for wirticisms is not on
the bulletin board notices If we
must be witty or, must try to be
witty. let our energy

other people's rights to the ex
tent or causing them permanent
annoyance.

The hurdles are also spoken of
in a vein not altogether gloomy.
