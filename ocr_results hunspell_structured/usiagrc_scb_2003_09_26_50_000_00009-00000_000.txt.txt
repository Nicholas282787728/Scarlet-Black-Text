Explaining Happiness, with

professor David Ellison

“Explaining Happiness rs like liberal edumrion incar»
n1rc,"snid David oirpson ‘07. “Professor Ellison approaches
rhe ropie from a wide range ofdiseiplines. So far we have
looked as psychology and philosophy as approaches, bur
we also have hisrory. economics, political science, sociol.
ogy, geography and lireranrre as realms of study."

Ellison chose rhe ropie ofhis nnorial in pan because of
rho opponuniry n presenred to address a wide variery or
academic disciplines. “Tl-re ropie orhapprness was one rhar
l rhoogln very malleable and one rhar could easily be ad.
dressed from multiple disciplinarydireerions," said Ellison,
“We are [also] working on informarion lneracy (rhe use of

sources, as well as how ro go aborn evaloaring rherr reliabil.

ofwriring and research skills."

“We have read a variery ofanielcs and cxccrpn, many
ofwliich have sparked gmal diseussion and debare," said
Clipson. "Explaining Happiness rs nor all fun and gnms
like u might seem, bur whee we sake allay from rhe discus
sions rs insighr irno a very inreresring and rmponanr topic:
happiness."

Acoording ro Clipson, Ellison uses his role as nnorral
professor rowanl runherrng hrs nudenrs' own happiness

be loss as so whar expeeranons apply as Grinnell,” said
Clipson, "Tutorial is like, Hey, hrsoyear, rhis isn’t high
