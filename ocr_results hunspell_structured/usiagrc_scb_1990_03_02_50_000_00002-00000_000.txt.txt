coordinates the dancing, and every
one is invited. We’d like to see as
many people come as possible,”
Zaprudsky said.

The week will conclude with a
community Shabbat service and a
homecooked Israeli dinner on Fri-
day night, followed by a I-Iavdallah
Service and candle»making on Sat
urday night. The menu for Friday‘s
meal differs from the special dinner
served in the dining hall last Tues
day. Friday's meal features only
Israeli dishes, including noodle
kugel, hallah, and taboulli salad,
whereas the special dinner served
traditional dishes from various
Jewish sects. "Food is a significant
part of our culture. Most Jewish
people would be familiar with

events, said that since the candles
are directly related to thel-Iavdallah
service. the candle-making is a way
of encouraging participation.
“We’ve kind of taken the tradi»
tional service and made it work for
the type of community we have
here," he said. “We, as a group,
have had a lot of success this year
with creating a sense of community

and sort of creating a weekly ritual
that everyone can feel a pan of."
Chalutzim member Rachel
Landsberg agreed that the increased
participation has had a definite
impact on the atmosphere of Shab~
bat Table and the Havdallah Serv-
ice. “People are more enthusiastic;
they look forward to it every week.
They make time outoftheir sched-
ule for it," She said. “This week's
events are just very indicative of the
way the year’s been going for us.”

Joint Board Rejects
Committee Proposal

By Jessica Weisel

At Wednesday’s Joint Board
meeting, SGA voted down a pro-
posal to create a Committee for
Ideological Equity in Instruction.
The vote, taken after nearly an hour
of debate, was overwhelmingly
against instituting the proposal.

The proposal would have created
an ad hoc committee whosepurposc
would have been to make recomr
mendatlons to increase the “variety
of ideologies" presented toGrinnell
students. It would also have made
recommendations to encourage va
riety in the hiring of professors,
changes in the curriculum, and
materials presented in classes.

In an often heated debate. the
issue was discussed by the Joint
Board, who were joined by Presir
dent George Drake and Vice-Presi-
dent Waldo Walker and Dean of the
Faculty Charles Duke.

Mike Kent, who presented the
proposal. claimed that the Commit
tee was needed as an avenue for a
student to pursue a complaint of
ideological bias. Kent recognized
thal“impartialily"’isimpossihle,but
claimcdthatthis measurecouldhalp
to introduce a variety of ideologies
Lhatdifferfrom the“slandard,colle-
gialc, Cornﬁeld liberalism," offered
at Gtinnell.

OLhcr participants in the debate
disagreed with Kent's claim. Elana
Tyler, after stressing that she was
not representing SGA in her coin-

ments, argued against Kent’s state-
ment that Grinnell was an “intellec-
tual Vaccuum.” She added that the
Student Curriculum Committee has
been examtning the course-evaltlr
ation process.

Drake, when asked why he had
rejected Kent‘s original proposal to
establish a Presidential Committee,
said that neither he nor the trustees
could dictate the faculty or the cur-
riculum. If he had implemented the
committee, he said it would have
been a“draslic invasion ofacademic
freedom." Both he and Duke agreed
that such a committee would be
perceivedas athreat and aninfringee
ment on academic freedom.

Bob Rmson responded to Drake’s
statement by adding that the pro:
posal gave SGA “a bloated percepe
tion of (its) own power." He also
made a rhetorical question, “Do we
have the power to tell a professor
what to teach?"

Kent left the discussion before
the voiewas taken, butnotbefore he
was able to make a last statement.
He said thatGrinnell wasnot the real
world and that to townspeople, Grtnr
ncll students were simply “hippies."
Funherrnore, he added, once out of
Grinncll, he would beable to defend
his ideas against attacks, while the
rcstofGrinncll's students would be
“blown away." Then, in response to
snickers from the audience, Kent
said, "You can laugh now, but In
five years, I’ll be the one who's ‘
laughing."
