:S A.C.C. Discusses Sucking Bitnet

By Diane Erumley

i,

, You know the story well. It might
be 10:300rsoon aWednesdaynighL
You have a live-page paper due the
next morning by 8 a,m., and are still
slutching to hopes of going to the
Bar with friends around midnight.
With a folder full of xeroxed docu-
ments,twoor three200»page texts,a
yen and some type of caffeinated
beverage you head for a terminal
‘room
a No free terminals. Everyone else
Yis working on a paper, too.
Or are they,..,'.7
* Speaking from personal experi»
aence, and having overheard conver-
‘sations about similarscenes, many a
frustrating night has been spent sit»
‘ting in the computer room, waiting
Jora student—or group of students,
’as the case usually is 7 to stop
fooling around on Bitnet.
‘ What the students are using is
scalled the Relay system, part of Hit»
,net. a computer network linking

VAXes around the country and 1
“around the world, Use of Bitnet is ,

clicensedtothecollegethroughNorth
‘Dakota State University.

Concern has been raised at recent
‘meetings of the Student Academic
1Compun'ngCommittee,orS.A.C.C.,
,about “Relay users being on tenni-

nals during peak paper times.”
* Jessica Madoc-Jones, student
‘government representative on
s S.A.C.C., said that students who are
’denied requests by Relay users to

logoff may type in the command
"‘hotline," sending a message to Bill
,Francis, director of computer serv-

 

ices.

The complaint should say what
happened and include the Relay
user’s name. Repeat offenders using
Relay can actually lose computer
privileges for a certain amount of
time.

“Relay is a recreational program.
Academic purposes supercede rec-
reational use of the computers.” said
Benn Tannenbaum, chairman of
S.A.C1Ct ”Therefore, each student
reserves the right to ‘bump’ a Relay
user in order to write a paper."

Options discussed at a recent
S.A.C.C. meeting for settling com-
plaints against Relay users included
asking North Dakota State to re-

move Grinnell from Bitnct’s Relay
service, or making it illegal to use
Relay during certain times.

Tannenbaum said that removal
from the Relay program was ruled
out because of complications involv-
ing computer licenses,

As far as any other action is con-
cerned, he said that the committee
needs “a decent sample of letters or
complaints that says ‘Yes, this is
indeed a problem.m that may be
shown to Francis.

Tannenbaum said S.A .C. can
notchangecomputerregulauons,hut
can only recommend changes to
computer services.

Burling Catalogs Go Onlme

:College Judicial Council to Hear Case
:on Students Against Hippies Sunday

‘ By Brendan Shepherd

Judicial Council will hear the ﬁrst
’case concerning harassment charges
against the group Students Against
LHippies and its controversial posters

this Sunday night. The organization’s
*founder, Mike Kent, will defend his
‘V advertising methods against Douglas

Hess and Daniel Werner, the two
‘ complainants in the case, in theopen
3 hearing scheduled forSpm, Sunday
‘ in Forum private dining room B.

Posters for the group showed car-
‘ Icons of demonstrators being
k bombed and read, “Bleed, Hippies,
_ Bleed” and “Bohemians must be

destroyed.” Kent is also being
‘ charged with allegedly interfering
,with Judicial Council‘s hearing
( process,

In a written statement to Judicial
* Council, the complainants said they
9 feel “personally threatened" by the
5 posters and alleged that the posters

violate college regulations. citing
‘ page 53, item 4 of the Student Hand-
.— book, which prohibits “assault, har-
assment or threats of harm to person
Y or property."
* Hess and Werner also allege that

Kent posted additional threatening
signs meant to intimidate anyone
considering ﬁling a Judicial Council
case, again a violation of college
regulations.

In the statement Hess said. ”I
consider protesting to be an impor-
tant part of my life as I lead a very
political lifestyle.“

“Sincel am a ‘demonstrator’ and,
at least in the eyes of SAH (Students
Against Hippies), a ‘hippie' (a pejo-
rative in my mind), I feel these signs
are harassment," Hess wrote.

Werner said in his statement to
Judicial Council that the additional
poster addressed him directly,

“It labeled us as hippies and in-
sisted that we would fail” in any
Judicial Council action, he said,
“Since the earlier sign had encour-
aged violence against those who the
defendant labeled as hippies. and
here he was labeling us as such, I
again felt threatened, and that this
constituted an attempt to intimidate
those of us who were considering
taking judicial action against Mr.
Kent," Werner said

Kentdefendedhimselfinhisstate-
ment saying that neither he nor his

organizationhasever“publiclyiden»
tiﬁed any person as a ‘hippie’" and
that the violence in the posters was
meant as a joke, not as a threat
“'I'heir context is obviously hu-
morous and no rational, reasonable
person could actually take them to
be a serious threat," Kent wrote “In
addition, the poster did not state that
‘I am going to blow you up,’ but
rattler shows fictitious cartoon char-
acters in a comic setting being non-
lethally blown up by a cartoon dog”

In his statement Kent called Hess
and Wemer‘s second charge — that
Kent put up posters meant to intimi»
date people thinking about ﬁling
charges—“bogus,“ Kent said he put
up the additional poster four days
before Hess and Wemer’s case was
ﬁled with Judicial Council and that
the sign did not speciﬁcally address
anyone.

In his statement, Kent argued that
“only by the funhest stretch of the
imagination" can his posters be seen
as harassment. He urged Judicial
Council not to be a party to “censor-
ship" and the “stiﬂing of dissenting
viewpoints.”

Trustees Discuss Building
New Dorm, Arts Center

Grinnell‘s board of trustees met
on campus Oct. 12 and 13, and their
agenda included talk aboutbttilding
anew artsbuildingandanew donni-
tory, demolishing three Park St.
houses, creating two new faculty
positions for next year. and restruc-
turing the board and changing its
name, college president George
Drake reported at a faculty meeting
Wednesday

“It was not a meeting with a lot of
earth-shakingdecisions,"Dmke said.
He said the trustees talked mostJy
about ongoing projects.

The new ans building would in-
clude a small. professional-quality

* theater, dance space and an adjoin—

ing art gallery.

Blueprints for die modem-look-
ing building place it between Burl-
ing Library and the current Fine Ans
building, jutting far out into Central
Campus. At its highest point the
structure would rise 200 feet above
Burling. The building would cost
$65 to $7 million, Drake said, and
would be built within five to 10
years.

Plans for the building were drawn
up by the architectural firm Brown
Healey Bock, which also designed

. the forthcoming Harris student cen-

ter.

The board also talked about possi-
blydemolishingthreesnidenthouses
on Park St, Drake said the three
houses—1008, 1019 and 1023 Park
— are in very poor shape and not
worth renovating,

The tnistees are considering build-
ing a new dormitory, Drake said, to
relieve dorm overcrowding, espe-
cially the overcrowding that the

demolition of the Park St. houses
would cause.

No plans have been drawn up for
the dorm, but dean of student affairs
Tom Crady has visited other col-
leges to get ideas for new student
housing, Drake said.

Tbeboard approved two anda half
new faculty positions for next year.
one in the philosphy department,
one in religious studies (a chair
named in honor of Drake). and half-
time position in the Spanish depart-
ment.

The board of trustees has also
decided to change its name from the
Trustees of Iowa College to the
Trustees of Grinnell College, Drake
said. The board‘s current name, a
remnantofGn'nnell‘ soriginal name,
has been causing periodic problems
with donations, with donors writing
“Grinnell College” on checks when:
they ought to write “Iowa College,"
andviceversa.IowaCollegechanged
its name to Grinnell College in 19091

The board also decided to restruc-
ture itself, doing away with the old
ﬁnance committee and creating in- .
vestment, budget and audit eommit~
tees instead.

“The board is in a transitional
period with respect to its organiza-
tion," Drake said. He said the trus-
tees are bracing for the departure of
trustee Joseph Rosenﬁeld, who has
acted like an anchor on the board

Drake said the trustees 7 “ag-
gressive, devoted to the college,
spontaneous"ialwayshold“lively
andchallengingmeetings."“Youcan
prepare all sorts of agendas and you
stilldon‘tknowwhat’sgoingtocome
up," he said.
