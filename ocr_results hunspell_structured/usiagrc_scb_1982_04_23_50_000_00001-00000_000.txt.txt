Meats Cottage, built in 1888, before the 1903 addition. ‘7

by Laura lean Carter and Laura Jean McDermith

In January, 1979. during the last
semester of use as a dormitory, Mears Cot
tage was placed on the National Register
of Historic Places. Even after the building
earned this distinction, the Board of
Trustees stuck by its 1977 decision to
demolish the building and replace the lost
living space with a.fourth ﬂoor on Norris
Hall. Only after a swell of campus and
alumni opposition in 1978 and 1979 did the
trustees change their minds and grant the
Late Victorian “cottage" form structure
an indefinite stay .of execution.

However, Mears was a controversial
issue three years ago and this year's
graduating class, the last students to have
lived in the dormitory, have been joined by
the rest of the campus community in wats
citing the building deteriorate. According
to Professor oi History David Jordan,
Meal-s is now ”an eyesore instead of an at-
tractive structure." Jordan and other
Grinnellians are afraid mat the trustees
will delay taking action to upgrade Mears
”until it’s beyond saving.“

At a February interview, Chairman of
the Board of Trustees Fritz Maytag
revealed that the trustees do not intend to
begin any work on the building for two to
three years. President George Drake ex»
plained, “It’s a question of balancing the
priorities of campus space against the
deteriorating construction and until the
dorms and library [renovations] are
finished, no new projects will be started."

The Dober Report of 1977, which is the
basis of current campus renovations,
recommended the rehabilitation or
restoration of Mears. The report Cited
several problems of the building, including
substandard electrical service, faulty
plumbing and interior woodwork that
presents a fire hazard. To make Mears
adequate for use as a dormitory would cost
the college (as of 1976) $849,500. This ﬁgure
could be lower, the report acknowledged,
if the physical plant staff would do some of
the interior work.

Drake said “ﬂ’ie key thing" to be con-
sidered in taking any action with Mears is
that it will not be used as a dormitory.
“Although it would certainly have to be a
safe building, less would have to be done

for fire safety“ if the "structure'wer'e’uscd‘ '

for Olilce space. The estimated cost of
upgrading Mears for such use is 3500.000,

“We‘re not thinking it needs a complete
overhaul," he said. "Presently, its best
use would be for Admissions." If the
building were converted into Admissions
and Financial Aid offices, the ground floor
would be especially adaptable and Drake
suggested that the first rloor lounge could
serve as a reception area. The top story
could be reserved for faculty offices,

other suggestions for the building's use
were discussed in lWSrﬂo by the Campus
Design Committee, created when Drake
became president in 1979. Tim Stenzel, a
student who served on the original com-
mittee, said that although the committee
has not met recently to discuss Mears, the
members have considered restoring only
the original cottage. “Peisonally,” Stenzel
said, “i think it should be renovated,
especially the woodwork and fireplace. [is
in a fairly good location and could be put to
good use.” He added, “Something should
be done fairly quickly; it's in bad repair."

Mears is not ranked highly on the list oi
campus construction priorities. Drake
reported the college's most urgent need is
to find more space for the psychology
department, This space could be created
by adding to the Science Building or
building a new free-standing facility. The
psychology department's present offices
and labs in Goodnow could then be turned
into raculty offices, Goodnow, built in road,
is the oldest building on campus and was
placed on the National Register oi Historic
Places at the same time as Mears. But the
plans for the psychology department move
and Goodnow's future “are not cast in con
Crete," Drake emphasized.

A group or alumni at last springs Alums
ni Reunion were appalled by the condition
of Mears. Led by Jim and Abby Swanson
Freemen, a group began to raise funds for
maintenance for the building. According to
both Jordan and Drake, the alumni have
raised over $1,000. But a member of the
Development Office staff who asked not to
be idenitiiied reported that only 8360 has

. been received from 25 donors. Alumnus

to the campus earlier this year and no
maintenance work had been started.

Funding for a Mears rehabilitation or
restoration project is also disputed. Jor~
dan believed money for the project would
be “the easiest money in the world to
raise,“ especially because the project is
specific enough that it would not detract
from the college's other fund-raismg efr
torts Drake, however, stated that
“definite plans depend largely on runding,
If we have a donor, Mears may be brought
up in priorities." Chances of federal fun-
ding tor the project have been reduced by
the frugal Reagan Administration budget
and National Register status will not in»
crease the likelihood of federal monies
contributing. _

Drake, a graduate of the class of 1956,
said, “I want to keep Mears. It‘s part of
[Grinnell's] heritage; it's not a bad
building, It‘s not definite that I'll succeed.
There's not a lot of sentimentality about
Mears on the board [of Trustees]."

Built in 1838, Mears Ladies CDtLage first
housed 30 female students in 1889. Mears,
then nicknamed “the Shack,” was the first
women's dormitory on the Grinnell cam-
pus.

Mary Grinnell Mears was the daughter
of J.B. Grinnell, founder of the college.
Mary Grinnell met Reverend David O.
Mears when he came as commencement
speaker the year or the tornado (1332).

EA. Goodnow donated $5,000 for the con
struction or Mears Hall at the suggestion oi
Mears, reverend of the church to which
Goodnow belonged. Goodnow requested
the building be named in honor of Mary
Grinnell Mears,

Mears was built in the “late Victorian
‘cottage' form," according to the 1979 ap-
plicaiton for listing on the National
Register or Historic ‘Places. “The arr
chitect has been scrupulous in avoiding
repetition of detail in like architectural
elements," the application stated. “Wm-
dow shapes, for example, vary. . . and the
rooldormers are each treated differently. .
. The building is not without a certain
ungainly quality."

Leslie Williams, '82, lived in Mears her
freshman year. She said that the hall was
in “pretty good shape" when she lived
there. “It [Mearsl was much more like
what a dorm is supposed to be, homey and
comfortable," she said, Williams is "very
much against the destruction of Mears."
She is also afraid that the issue will be ig-
nored once seniors graduate since her
class is the last class that had access to
Mears.

Professor of History David Jordan wrote
in an article for the Nov ll], 1978 issue of
the Scarlet and Black,

“In recent years, the college has
probably been the primary
destroyer or buildings in Grinnell:
Alumni Hall in 1958; the Administra-
tion Building (formerly Chicago
Hall) in 1959; Blair Hall in 1961; the
Women‘s Gym, razed in a surprise
move in the summer of 1972; the
demolition of the old Iowa Theatre.
built ca. 1900 in downtown Grinnell
in 1974; "

Anne Rawland quoted Matt Hussman in
the NOV. 17, 1978 issue oi the Scarlet and
Black as having said, “The whole thing
[the razing of Mearsl strikes me as in-
sane; Ican' imagine why they‘d destroy
such a beautiful old building."

The editorial in the previous issue
argued, “Not only does Mears offer an at.
tractive place to live, it also graces the ap
pearance of the college and provides a cone
crete reminder or the college's rich past."

A committee was formed in late
November of 1978 to save Mears. Members
wrote letters to alumni and kept the issue
alive on campus. Jordan's articles in the
5&8 stressed the importance oi Mears and
educated the college community or its
value. Their actions yielded a temporary
reprieve by the Board or Turstees on Jan.
13. 1979. which is. still in ertect. The
trustees agreed at thattimeto study alter.
native plans for renovation and use.
