Voter madness

Staff opinion on voting in Grinnell

Unless you spent the last two months studiously avoids
ing television, radio and espeeinlly the son, you know
that the race between Danny Carroll and Eric Palth for
Iowa House is close. \Vhen Carroll and Palmer duked it
out in 2004, Cnnoll beat out Palmer by only 114 votes

Because higher turnout among college students might
make the
difference
in 2006,

endorsing a
candidate. But we corrldn‘r reach consensus. Our disagree-
ment boiled clown to this: Are we, as Votct's, comfortable
with being the deciding factor in a district we will leave
as soon as we are handed diplomas? Some ofus are. Sonic
ofus are not.

We repeated arguments that resurface with every clccr
tion. Iowa is an important swing state, and our votes mny
have more impact here than in our home states. Since we
are transitory and may not return to our borne districts af-
ter graduation Grinnell may feel more like home than our
parents’ house does. On the ﬂip side, students often vote
rcﬂexively, marking r straight party ballot without edrrrnrr
ing themselves about the candidates and local issues.

After all of our sparring we agreed on only two things:
You are not Satan’s spawn ifyuu don't vote in Iowa, nor are
you Satan’s spawn ifyou do, The decision to vote entails
an investment in the candidates and issues facing your dis-
trict, and at this stage in our lives, it is up to the individual
student to decide where he or she feels more invested. '

Edlto Endorse Eric Palmer
In our d' cussion on whether to endorse a candidate
,in the Carroll-Palmer race, the 5673 editorial staff had
mixed opinions and declined to endorse.I srrongly dis
agree and pct 56:13 policy, opt to write a dissenting opin—
io . Eric Palmer should be elected to the Iowa House.

This isn’t a quesu‘on of lesser of two evils; the two
candidates diverge strongly on the issues. Carroll has
consistently voted against minimum wage increases and
{or mnking it hurder for workers to uniollizc. Palmer has
made a raise in the minimum wage the centerpiece ofbis
campaign and has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO. Car-—
roll has voted to weaken Iowa’s environmental protection
laws; Palmer has said in ads he'll “work hard for Clean wa»
ter that affects everyone from Iowa to the Gulf."Carroll
wants to outlaw abortion and supports a constitutional
amendment banning gay marriage. Palmer supports
abortion rights and opposes a constitutional amendment
banning guy marriage.

Beyond issues, Palmer cares about students. He has
visited campus halfa dozen times, while Carroll has been
nearly absent, probably because the GOP's anti student-
voring brochure has nor been torgorten, Prtlmer is genu-
ine, he’s authentic. He wants to do good for G innell and
for Iowa. lflrc can muster a few more votes, we’ll l ‘we
someone we can be proud to call our rcprescntut'ivc: Eric
Palmer for Iowa House, in unqualiﬁed cndotsemcun

I think our generation has a lot
of rrouhle being authentic, heeruse
we’re ' rid of saying Something

we have trouble believing in What

a strand of academia that's hard to

Silva: Caucuses

It's caucus season, Yes, ir’s rime to get rerrdy for the Iowa
CaucusesThat's when a couple hundred thousand Iowans get
to tell 299 million other Americans who their next president
should be, In 2004, for instance, John Kerry and John Ed
wards came from behind to behind to E i one and two in
the enueuses.Tlrnt performance vrrnnlly ended the presidenrinl
aspirations ofDrck Gephardt and Howard
Dean,

The next presidential contests look to
be equally contentious. 'l he onlv difference
is thrr borlr parties will have eompetrtrve
races. So Jan. 2008 will be an interesting
time to be in Iowa.

But ifyorr want to participate in one of
rhe extraordinary cvenrs ofAmericrln poll—
tics, the time to act is NOW
