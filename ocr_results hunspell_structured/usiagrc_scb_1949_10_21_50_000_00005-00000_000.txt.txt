Unpack Those Suitcases
Vacation’s Just a Rumor

By Bob
"Thanksgiving vacatlon’!

nell students are to rumors.

Under the supervision ot theii-
instructor, Melvin Miller
(speech), members of the class
set up the experiment last week.
Each member told‘ two other
students that tllc Thursday, Frlr
day and Saturday over Thanks-
giving would be a holiday. Ape
proximately 10% of the student
body was informed of the rumor,
the distribution divided as eqllal~
ly as possible between the tour
classes, 17 halls and cottages, and
the »t\\'o sexes.

Authorities Informed

Forseeing some instances in
which individuals in authority
would be approached regardlngi‘
the i-uhior,,incmbers of the Croi
HP, ‘ League Board, -‘ and Deans
Strong, Gardner, Duke, and Miss
.McCancllcss were also iniormed
of the rumor, It was their task,
to note the time they tirst heardl
the rumor, and to respond that
“nothing offlcal” had been done
about it yet.

The rumor was put into cir—
culation at 8:50 Tuesday morn-
ing, and a check made of all
group 6 classes at 1:15 Wednes—
day to determine how many of
the students in those classes had
heard the rumor.

it is from this survey, and;
iroin information obtained from
c or HP, League Board, and ad.
ministration meinbers. that the

i

class has computed their results. ‘
i
on-

Mr. Oelke (chemistry),
ﬁnding that only two of his
class of seven had heard the rue
mor, made the comment, “Just
goes to show that we scientists
don’t believe in rumors” A little
figuring shows that 285% of Mr.
Oelke’s class haggheard the ru-
mor—a higher percentage than
any other class on campus. TheI
next highest percentage wasl
2.5%, shown by mémbers or a
speech class under the supervis—
ion of Miss Hazel Moritz.

Class Members

Members of the class are
Marilyn Kegg, Tod Moore, Frank
Rathje, Denny Gaines, Don'
Schantz.Hansen and Bob Green.
The study was in connection
with class work on rumors, what
they are, and what makes them
good or had.

or the 443 students in the 22
classes meeting in group 6, 52,
or 11.75%, had heard the rumor,
The only administrative oiflcer
approached concerning the Vaca-
tion was Miss Lemmons, assist.
ant to Miss Gardner, who rce
ceived two inquiries.
