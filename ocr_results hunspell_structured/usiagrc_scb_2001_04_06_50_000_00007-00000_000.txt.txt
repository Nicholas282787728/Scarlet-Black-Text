Projects: Denver Urban Gardens, spring break
kids’ comp, Food Bank of the Rockies, Food Not
Bombs

The Denver al

ternative break participated
in several projects. Our ﬁrst week we worked
with Denver Urban Gardens, which operates
several small garden plots throughout Denver
that give poor families an opportunity to grow
their own nutn'tious food. They also operate
an urban farm which works under a community
supported agriculture model to advocate
sustainable agriculture. The farm also donates
food to local nonproﬁts (over 3,000 lbs last
year).

The second week we worked in halt day
shifts with a spring break kids camp that serves
children from Denver's housing projects. The
main focus of the camp is art activities, but it
also includes sports and drug prevention
components. With the kids, we made Javanese
shadow puppets, Arrican masks, and other art
projects, and the kids also learned African and
hip~hop dance and theatre skills The week
culminated with an exhibition and performance
for the students‘ families and friends.

While we weren't at the kids Camp, we also
volunteered at the Food Bank of the Rockies, a
transitional housing program called “Family
Homestead," and the Denver Catholic Worker.
Finally, on our Saturdays we worked with Food
Not Bombs, an anarchist group that collects
food that stores planned on throwing away and
uses it to cook healthful, tasty (usually), vegan
meals for Denver‘s poor.

While in Denver we stayed at an unused
Convent, While the direct service is an important
part of the program, another key component
was reflection on the programs. community
service, and social issues.

For me, the pest part or Alternative Break
Denver was getting to know the kids at the
spring break camp we worked at the second
week. I interpreted this as an opportunity to
spend one-on-one time With the kids in a
setting where their individual needs would not
have been overly attended to by the staff. The
staff consisted or site coordinators (employees
or the Denver Housing kuthon'ty) from the rour
different housing projects that the kids lived
in, elementary schoolteachers, drama and dance
teachers, and volunteers irom Denver University.
1 round that kids (ranging in age rrom 5-14)
will open up pretty quickly, even it they are
dealing with really difﬁcult, stressfulthings and
don't always have the space to reel like kids.
Some or the kids who conﬁded in me had
parents in jail or recently out orjail and were
very attuned to the intricacies or the court
system. Others simply said that the doors to
their apartment were always locked. I think that
there are many assumptions made about people
who live in housing projects or in the inner
city. It is very important to go into an
experience with any new person, even a kid,
being open to anything they may tell you about
their lives. 1 don't know if all the kids there
were dealing with neglect or violence, or any
orthe problems that our society associates with
the inner city, 1 only know what the kids that
talked to me were experiencing. with younger
people who are vulnerable simply by virtue of
being young, it is important to listen to them
and provide a comrortaole space tor them to
share things with older people. It is also
important to know that their problems, like
anyone’s problems, are not going to be solved
in a week.

Projects: Building houses and a community center with Esperanza International

 

 

 

m—

Our days in Tijuana were ﬁlled with concrete, cinder blocks,
rebar and tetanus wire. The Mexico alt break trip worked with
Esperanza, a community-based group that builds houses,
Community centers and medical clinics with community
involvement in Tijuana.

Our typical day involved leaving the Posada (where we stayed)
at 8:30am, enjoying near-death van rides along the highways
and unpaved roads of Tijuana. We arrived at the work site and
spent our days making and hauling buckets or cement up hills
and pouring it into the walls to reinforce them. We also learned
about the joys of rebar, vonrio, and tying wire,alambre, to the
reinforce the house.

I enjoyed seeing the walls or the houses and community
center we helped to construct rise, but the most enjoyable
part of the work day was lunch. For lunch, women in the
community who were going to have, were having or had had
houses built tor them by Esperanza made us our meal. ihe
Food consisted of home made tortilbs, beans, rice and potatoes.
rhose at us who were able to speak Spanish traded jokes, stones
and experiences with the women and their children.

However, the most transforming part or the alt break trip
was understanding the greater issues that were pong people
in Tijuana We visited the border wall horn both the Mexico
and U , and was made abundantly clear to me that the

out. We learned from our the group coordinator and social
workers from Esperanza about how NAFTA and politics in the
U.S. negatively affected Tijuana, Mexico and Latin America on

The images that have stuck with me the most from this trip
are passing by a Guatemalan woman passed out on the stieetin
a touristy area when our group went out for the evening and
seeing her two sons curled up next to her and her daughter
crying out of desperation. I felt helpless, after all, I was only a
"poor’ college kid who had to get home so [wouldn’t be tired
for work in the morning. The otherimage that has stuck with
rile was seeing (and hearing) three helicopters overhead when
we tried to visit the state border park irum the US. side, Walking
through this area ielt like a militarized Zone within our own
borders. I felt like the U.S. Border Patrol was ready tllﬁght a
warj‘ust to keep a group of people on one side of an arbitrary
line that divides Tijuana, a city of 4 million, with little sewage,
running water or electricity; from San Diego, a prosperous U.S.
city that shows no acknowledgement of the conditions it has
helped to create thirty minutes South.
