ncouraged the audience to
dividually and collectively
ork toward building a "more
erfect union." Many people
alked about the controversy
urround' g Farrakhan's pri-
ary role in organizing the
arch. We did not attend this
arch to support Minister
ouis Farrakhan's vi ws. our
urpose was to participate in
historic occasion that raised
wareness of problems con-
ronting the African American
ommunity, specifically Afri-
an American men, and what
e as a community can do to
ddress these problems.

One of the criticisms
bout the March was that
lack women were not in-
Iuded. Although this was a

arch for Black men, clearly

Black women played
a role in the Mi on
Man March. There
were several Black
women speakers
and participants
who were as impor-
tant to the March as
the Black men in-
volved. Black
women have always

front of leading
Black people

we felt that the
Million Man March
was not about ex-
cluding Black
women, but it was
about inspiring and
encouraging Black
men to share lead-
ership with Black
women in fam' ies

An armored truck
screeched to a halt. Then, a
light wave of morning rush
hour traffic, hesitantly coast-
ing through a yellow light,
abruptly stopped. From the
midst of about four hundred
Black men, a bearded figure
with kinky braids stepped into
the street. with outstretched
arms. a long wooden cane,
and a menacing stare, he
blocked traffic. Turning to-
ward the crowd of men who
have stopped at the cross-
walk. he yelled in a baritone
voice that echoed off of the
hollow buildings, "Hey, mon,
bring your boombIa-clots on,
mo " (I learned later that
this meant "bring your asses
on.") Astonished, yet full of
pride, four hundred Black men
strolled across the street.

on the bus from Chicago,
there were rival gang mem-
bers who sat together. Ironi-
cally, two of them were broth-
ers, who ordinarily never hung
out together. At the Million
Man March, however, they
spent the entire day together
and even managed to get lost
in the city later that evening.

iust a drop

in the

bucket

when com-

pared to

the diverse

atmo-

sphere of

the March

itself.

There were

men

present

from states

as far west

as California

and Texas, and as near as
New Jersey and Virginia.
Many immigrants were also
in attendance. All of the
men, no matter what their
origin, were enthralled to be
in the company of so many of
their Black peers. The wis-
dom of the elderly, repre-
sented by a 109 year-old
man, was intertwined with
the hope of youth, as many
of the marchers brought
their sons. we shared in
their ecstasy at being sur-
rounded by an abundance of
adventurous people who,
despite their social, political,
and religious differences.
united on this historic day.
