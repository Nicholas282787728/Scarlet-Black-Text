separate interview process will
also enable the interviewers better
to evaluate the candidates. “The
new process will highlight the
skill of candidates, be they SAS

Some current and former
HACs and 8A5 welcomed the
chanacs. “i think it will better

HACS," said former SA Trini
Campbell. “Sometimes HACs

chemistry and biochemistry at the
University of Colorado, and
Phillip Sharp, professor of
biochemistry and director of the
Center for Cancer Research at
MIT.

Cech was cited for his
discovery that RNA is not only a
messenger for DNA, the cell’s
genetic storehouse, but also
possesses surprising abilities as a
catalyst in cellular processes.

Sharp was cited for
elucidating how RNA is
fashioned to carry out its
functions in assembling the cell‘s
proteins.

Both Cech and Sharp were
awarded the 1988 Albert Lasker
Basic Medical Research Award for
their separate discoveries
concerning die workings of RNA
in November of 1988.

Cech, who was elected to the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences last year, has been the
recipient of several prestigious
awards including the National
Academy of Science Award, the
Pa uno Foundation Young
Scientist Award, the Harrison
Howe Award, a Guggenheim
Fellowship, and the Filter Award
in Enzyme Chemistry.

Cech, a Phi Beta Kappa
chemistry graduate of Grinnell
College (1970), was the college's
1986-87 Danforth Lecturer and
the first Grinnell alumnus to
occupy tllat position. He
received an honomry degree from
Grinnell College in 1987.

Center
rebounds
'from blaze

by Kim Eckart

A Jan. 22 fire destroyed the
Poweshiek County Mental
Health Center and forced the
center‘s relocation to St. John‘s
Luthemn Church.

The fire, which ofﬁcials have
determined was caused by arson,
damaged at least $100,000 worth
of property at the center’s
original location on Fourth
Avenue.

According to Mental Health
Center Executive Director John
Daniel, temporary quarters will
remain at the church through the
spring semester. “We hope to
begin construction by March 1,
but we definitely won’t be open
before June or July," Daniel said.

The center’s plans for
reconstruction involve publishing
applications for contractors in
local newspapers and selecting
from among the bids, Daniel
said.

The center's design will
remain basically the same.

The temporary location at the
comer of East and Eighth Streets,
has made the center more
accessible to students, although
Daniel said that “the lack of desks
has made it slightly inconvenient
for (center slam."

The center has retunied to its
normal scheduling of
appointments and sessions.
