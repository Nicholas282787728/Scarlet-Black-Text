RETROSPEGT

A bit thankfully—but with some regret, too—
the 1933-34 management of The Scarlet and Blzl
brings its year’s activities to a close witlt today’s
issue. To the lien management wo wish luck and
success. To our friends and enemies—we hope
that they will continue as our friends and enemies.
We have tried to be sincere in all that we have uu-
dcrtakell and if we have made mistakes, we can
only say as Samuel Johnson is reported to have
said to the critical lady, “It was pure ignorance,
lnadamcl Pure ignorance!” So we make no apolo-
gies, nor, on the otllcr hand, do we ask for any bou~
qucts.

A year ago, the present management drew up
a platform, promising to “work toward elimination
of unnecessary and inactive organizations on the
campus; the advance announcement of chapel pros
grams;’a successful Pioneer Prudities, anda strong
but some studcllt government.” At the time it was
also stated thrt “we are mulling no proluis s of
achievements, nor docs the management take Itself
so seriously that it is sure it can live up to all of
its aspirations.” As we look back, it seems well that
this was written . . . .

As for tile first project, the elimination of un-
necessary aud inactive organizations, very little
has been done. Such organizations do remain on
the campus. Yet they are dying natural deaths
and do not really constitute a problem. Advance
announcement of chapel programs. however, rc-
nlains a very real problem. Last fall, 21 promise
was made to The Scarlet and Black that Special
or “important” chapels would be allnnullc l, but
that tradition prevented the announcement of all
chapel programs. Surely the chzlpcl situation at
Grillllcll is not a healthy one. Limitation of chllp-
cl to fewer periods per week. announcement of the
program, or some other method must he used to
revive interest.

As for the Pioneer Pruditics, Thc Scarlet and
Flat: fought a losing game and has been accused
of being tactlcss and selfish. The first accusation
may be correct; the second is not. We believed and
still believe that an all-college revue would aid
immensely ill restoring the spirit of Grllncll to this
campus. The plan outlined by the dramatic coun-
cil for such ll l'chtC next year is :1 good one, one
which The Scarlet and Black will back heartily.

It is the subject of student govcrnlllent, how»
ever, which has been of major consideration. With
the revision of the Student Council constitution
this spring, lztrgcly through the work of Dwigllt
Campbell, president; and increased interest and
activity of both Council of House Presidents and
Women’s Self Government league under oxtr ncly
capable leadership throughout the year, the sitlh .
tion in regard to this subject is the most gratifying
in some time,

There have been other problems. The Scarlet
find Black advocated reserved seats for pal-outs at
commencement exercises last spring, the suggcs~
tion for the editorial coming from the daughter
of zl Grillncll faculty member. This was done. Thc
athletic situation has bccll discussed ill those
ulnlls and we feel sure that steps are being taken
by the administration to rcmcd ’ Trivial rules
and regulations have been attacked, with but lit-
tle cffcct_ In addition to local problems, we have
made an attempt during the administration, to ex
plain and interpret international and national po-
llt l and cconomic situations to the host of the
abilities of our editorial board.

The new management will, we are sure, treat
with fairness and sincerity those unfinished proj-
ects which it deems worthwhile. i

G
CLEAN AIR

Exccpt for the exclusion of Dr. Brinklcy, tllc,
goat gland specialist, from the nuthoz'.9d :lir
channels of this country, fclv appreciable 1t-
tompt have been made by the United States i-
dio officials to rid the air of the illnullicrable ll s-

ledding advertising
companies.

campaigns of quack rclllcdy

Through clcvcr employment of score adver-
tising: and questionable endorsements, inluuncre
llblo patcnt remedy companies are enjoying rich re-
turlls l'loul their radio appeals, it" the steady in-

"sc ill such advertising is any indication 01:
ﬁnancial success.

Tllzlt such programs llzlvc been allowed to rc-
mill]! (in the air is highly regrettable, but of late
a type of progl'nlll has appeared which is even
more upon to ccllsurc. A good example of this
t ')c of program is offered by “Dr. Price,” large

llc. faker, who broadcasting daily ovcr stzl-
tloll WHO-\VOC at Dds Moincs.

Dr. l’ricc answers absolutely frcr,“ any
three questions the listener may wish to ask, if
he but includes with his querirs a. one dollar
bill for “life guide.” \Vhat is the ”life guide?"
\Vho is “Dr. Price ‘3” \Vllel‘e is he from? No one
but the doctor knows, and he is very reluctant
to tell.

Thc scheme is no more honorable and (mor-
ates on till immensely larger scale than the fly
byvnigllt gold brick salesman of the p: t. Such a
program filchcs a hundred gulllblc souls to eve
iii-y mic, that thc ordinary confidence mmi can do-
L'Cth‘ through personal appeal.

Broadcasting of such confidence schemes has
not yct become common, lnlt, as in the case of
the patent llledjcillc broadcasts, a rapid inc so ill
the number of such programs is probable if steps
are not taken to rid the air 01' this menace. Every
week of delay will mean the loss of thousands of
dollars by llll American public that can ill afford
to lose such llll amount.

G7
NEW STATES FOR OLD

To the anarchist, society has been all instru»
lilcnt of oppression and suppression. It was soci-
cty which enslaved the individual, stifled his self
expression, and sent him to war to be maimed or
killed. That is wlly the anarchist has lltilt‘ll the
state.

To Rousseau, society caused the degeneration

of man. If ollly man were to go back to nature.
wearing a loin cloth and subsisting on berries. he
would be redeemed from the corruption of civili-
zation. To this French philosopher, the ideal life
would be that led by it Robinson Crusoe or ll
“Tarzan of the Apes.” '

It is lailiclitnllly true, that societies in the past
have been indifferent, if not harmful, to it vast
number of its citizen. But that has bccll due to
the short sightcduess, greed. and stupidity of
those ill power and ill office.

Society, or the state, is not, a iiiciieoo to indiv-
iduality. Man needs social institution. in which to
express himself, just as sound and _ lt lvzlvcs mod
the medium of the other in which to function. The
old social systems, based upon privilege mid pro.
t'it, Illust yield to new states ill which the individ
11le is the main concern of governlnan “‘0 can, if
we want to, build a state. in which even anarchists
and Rousseaus would be happy.

ARMS REFORM
(hIinuesotn. Daily)

Pseifists are vitally interested in seeing the end
of private munitions companies. These firms depend up-
on national suspicions and hatreds for their existence.

The world is kept in a constant state of unrest because.
if there is no conflict handy, the armament men create
one. There can he no hope for world peace if the produce
tion of instruments of war is left in private hands,

Milltarists, if sincere in their interest in an efficient

national defense, should be equally concerned with im-
proving the present situation. It seems reasonable to

say that any person with a. full knowledge and under
standing of the present armament setup, is inﬂuenced
by, or is a, part of, the vested interests of the industry.
An efficient national defense system for any country
is beyond the realm of possibility as long as private
arms makers are in the business for profit.

The only practical solution for the problem present.
ed by the munition industries seems to be a system of
government ownership, which might be accomplished in
this way: The national government might buy a number
of industrial plants, enabling it to manufacture all
armaments and munitions necessary for peacetime re-
quirements and as much as possible of other military
and naval supplies. These government—owned establish-
ments, producing armor-plate, ships, engines, airplanes,
guns, explosives, shells, and all other instruments of
war, would not be prepared for war-time production
on a large scale. Sudden expansion of these industries,
when necessary. could be cared for by action similar to
the American Legion proposal for “conscription of “an
tional Wealth." Industries necessary to the successful
waging of war would be operated by the government on
a non-profit basis for the duration of the war.

Placing the production of war materials on this has-
is is e step which can be taken by one government7
that of the United states, for instance—Without similar
action by other governments being necessary to insure
our safety in taking the step. The efficiency of nation-
a] defense might even be increased, while at the same
time the incentive for creating or prolonging wars has
been removed. And the proposal is an effective plan
which can he adopted without greatly disturbing the
ardent champions of the present economic system.

Nevertheless, there will be cries of “Soclalism!” or
perhaps even “Red propaganda!” To these, there is one
answer: For the older generation the choice is between
peace and arms profits, between control and chaos. For
the younger generation, the choice is between life and
death.
