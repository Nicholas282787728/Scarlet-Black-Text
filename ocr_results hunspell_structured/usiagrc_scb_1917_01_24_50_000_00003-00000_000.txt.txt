The reading or poems relating to the
war and comments on the war situa-
tion in general formed the chief lute
est in the lecture by Alfred Noyes last
Saturday evening.

\lr. Noyes read his more recent per
ems for the most part. A group based
on a Visit to the Br ish newlcrs prov

in some cases the wording had been
changed by the sense) added to the
leality of the situations. Several old-
er poems were also included on the
program, among them “The Admirals

ford Revisited." As 1m introduction
to the latter, Mr. Noyes described the

his last visit there about twelve weeks
ago.

Although Mr. Noyes several times
i-elcrretl humorously to endeavors to
be neutral, he strongly criticised the
German attitude and philosophy. The
cause of the continuance of the war,
he said, was the German refusal to bee
liere in political and international
morality, The only way out of the
situation, he declared, was El. league
to enforce peace such as President
Wilson endorses.

Evelyn lion], Recent Viciiln of

Appear Lately.

With the quarantine of Evelyn Boyd,
'19, last Saturday, the scarlet fever
episode in Grinnell seems to have ab»
ruptiy closed. No new cases have been
reported to the health authorities since
that time. and it is thought that the
disease has been brought under con-
trol. since more than enough time has
elapsed for the breaking out of small—
pox among those who were exposed to
the one victim, it is conceded that that
infection has also been smmped out.

Miss Boyd, although surlering from
a more severe attack of scarlet level-
than any or the preceding victims, is
lloL {seriously ill. It is feared, however,
than permanent eal‘ trouble may re»
sult. The Boyd house has been closed
during her illness, and will not be re»
opened as a college boarding club un-
til her recovery.

confined in the grandstand 0)] Ward

will undoubtedly be released before the
end 0f the week, it is stated.
