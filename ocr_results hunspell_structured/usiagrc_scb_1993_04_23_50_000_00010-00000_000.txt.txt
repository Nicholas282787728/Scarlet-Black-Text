Rebirth: The Repainting
of the Burling Walls

Submitted by Lucinda S. Moore ’96

 

 

African-American and African community painted the bath

roomson the thirdand fourth floors of Burling Library. Racist,
sexist, and homophobic statements were found on the walls of both
bathrooms, Two of the statements are quoted below:

“Niggers are proof that Indians f-ked Buffalo."
“The only reason we have Grinnell College is to populate
the world with Queer Faggott Liberals,”

This is only a sampleofthe statements made by members ofthe Grinnell
College community.

Students participated in the repainting for various reasons. “I was
surprised that this sort of blatant racism exists at Grinnell...I did not
want tobeexposed to thishlatantraeism every time I went to study," said
sophomore Jennifer Ashby.

Another student stated, “By repainting the bathrooms Iain chal—
lengtltg anyone who believes strongly in these issues to speak up."

Some students refused to participate in the repainting because they
feltit would do little good. “Although Isupport the students who did the
painting, I did not see the purpose. Painting will not address the issues
facing African-American students atGi‘innell College," said sophomore
Tara Nelson.

This author feels that writing such comments without a means of
identification is a sign ofcowardice. Other students agree. “In regard to
graffiti, personal confrontation would be more effective. Individuals
who write graffiti should include their name,..l don’t see the point in
addressing a wall," said Nelson.

“They shouldalso tncludetheir box numberso thatthcy can receive
a written response,” added sophomore Kristy Johnson.

Even though lam pessimistic, overall, many students are optimistic
that the repainting of the walls will have a positive effect on the
community at large.

The repainting of the Burling bathrooms marks a new beginning.
The African and AfricanrAmerican students of Grinnell have started a
rebirth of this institution. Now we pass the paint and brushes on to you.
Your future comments on bathroom walls, your Lreatmentofothers, and
the respect you show for noanuropcan cultures will determine the path
we all take in the life of this community. From rebirth to deaLh: let’s
make this campus a comfonable place for all!

ON Saturday, April 17, 1993 at 10:00 a.m. members of the

frequent the men‘s Burling basement bathroom

were shocked to read in last week's Scarlet and
Black about the inflammatory grafﬁti which graces
those walls, most of which ts gender-based. I fear that
this graffiti may make a troublesome statement con-
cemtng gender relations at Grinnell.

It is important to remember that our college ts an
experiment in co-habitation. Acquaintances at home
always react as ifI have thrown a wrench into their
wellradjusled lives when I inform them that unlike
housing conditions at
state university X , the
vast majority of resi»
dence floors where I
attend school are, as
the housing form so
eloquently puts it “cored by altcmating room." To
them, this is the ultimate in liberal decadence, They are
surprised to learn that I believe it helps men and women
understand each other far better than they otherwise
would or that most Grinnellians spend relauvoly little
time thinking, at least consciously, about the fact that
they live, eat, play and work With individuals of both
genders. In one way oranother, this does not mirror the
often gender polarized lifestyle of mainstream Ameri»
can culture. It is a challenging experiment. Is it a suc-
cessful one?

Gender-based graffiti reﬂects an underlying ten
sion in this lifestyle. There are certain things that I
would not say in a coed environment that would be
more permissible in a singlesex setting or kept within
my own mind. For example, I would not tell someone
down the hall, in the next dorm, or in my anthro class
I thoughtshe was hot, but it doesn’t mean I don’t have

I HAVE no doubt that many of you who do not

 

Graﬂlti Shows Importance of Communication

those feelings. I may become infuriated with my
fcmale friend in the next dorm because of someone
peculiarly female quirk that I have never understood.

I suspect that women also feel there are certain
things they can’t say because men are around. On the
odd occasion. groups of wotnen will mysteriously
vanish to talk among themselves. Men, on the other
hand, are not as used to talking comfonably among
themselves. For some individuals. hopefully a minor
ity, this tension can best be expressed best by writing
messageslike“lwanttof-kthehclloutofwomen with
btghugeboobs"instdetheBurling
basement bathroom stall walls.

Nevertheless, whether or not
we express our pentrup feelings
constructively or destructively, I
would argue that we are allowing
tensiontopersistbykeepingthemsocret.TheideaLhat
this tension is never released is frightening. It is
frightening to me as a heterosexual that there is a
barrier to my understanding of wotnen. It is also
frightening that in an increasingly diverse society. we
have difficulty relating to halfof the population.

That is why it is essential for us to learn how to
communicatewitheachotherhonestlyandcompletely.
We may be disturbed by what we have to hear, but in
order to live together, we need to know. It is also
important because although most of our feelings will
be harmless, some of that graffiti in the Burling base»
mentbathroom may notjustbewords. Itmay also lead
to violence. We need to hear that violence before
someone is forced to experience it. Ultimately, co-
habitation atGrinnell is notan experimentin isolation,
itmay also be a way oflife for a future of which all of
us will be a part.

To the Editor:

We,the undersigned, would like
to make a statement to the Grinnell
College campus, We feel that despite
theslatemenlthatGrmnellisanopen-
mindcd campus. it is not. Although
peopleclaim lobe Willing to listen to
all pointsotview onan issue, theyare
not willing to hear what others have
to say.

For instance, it is not easy to be
aconservative person on this campus
withoutbeinglabeled negatively.The
majority ofpeopleon thiscampus are
liberal, but the conservative minority
has the right to be heard as well.
