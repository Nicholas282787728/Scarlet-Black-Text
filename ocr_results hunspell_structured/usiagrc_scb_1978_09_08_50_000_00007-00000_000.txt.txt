This enthusiastic woman

past summer at home where
she played tor a women's team.

team: “I like it. The guys are
willing to teach me new techniques

better soccer player,"

tor the most part, her teammates
are ready and Willing to accept her
as another player Commenting on
his teammates' attitudes, 'cO-
captain Jonathan lliggins said,
“We are interested in bettering
ourselves as a team, and we really
don't care if a woman comes out.
Jeanne is doing really well and
we‘re glad to have her despite the
musculature difference. She has a
little bit of trouble adjusting to the
contact part of the game.”

COACH PFIT, II has praise for
the only girl on his Soccer team:
”I've known a lot of Grinnell
people, and that's why i became a

New coaches added
to Grinnell staff

by Alan Zoiiil ,

The 197871979 Grinnell College
athletic program sees the ap~
pearance ol two new coaches,
Robert and Mary Ann Pankey.

Robert Pankey is the new
defensive back coach for the
football team and will handle head
track coaching duties lor the
Pioneer men. Pankey has an M A.
degree in Physical Education
from Southern Illinois University.
He played football lor the
University of Missouri, and has
coaching experience in football
and track at the college and high
school levels.

MARY ANN ALSO received her
MA. in Physical Education from
Southern Illinois University. She

and will be head coach of the
women's indoorsoutdoor track
teams She was captain of both the
volleyball and track teams while
playing at‘SIU, She also has college
and high school level coaching
experience,

In looking to the season ahead,

' Mary Ann states. “i don't know

how the girls will perform come
petitively However, I feel that I
will be able to analyze them better
after the Luther Invitational and
Loyola Lake Front meets. Those
two meets will be our toughest, and
itthe girls perform well there, they
should do lairly well throughout
the season, These two meets will be
the real test."

MARY ANN BELIEVES that
motivation is a primary part of

coaching: ”I want to be able to
motivate these girls to give too per
cent all the time. I want to be able
to instill better confidence in
themselves and their ability,"

Robert stresses team par-
ticipation. “I want to get as many
people involved in the sport as
possible. I believe football should
be a good learning experience for
everyone out for the sport. or
course I'd like to win games, but I
feel that making the sport an en
joyable experience is equally
important

ROBERT THINKS TIIE football
team will do well this year, ”With
the diviswn system now in effect in
the conference. the smaller schools
will have a chance at getting into
the conference playoffs. I leel that
it we play each game as it comes,
and with the intensity that we
exhibit in practice. we will have a
shot at the division title. At this

'point, it’s anyone’s race."

Frisbee!

by Sarah Bricllford

There‘s a new rail 1M sport on
campus this year which, according
to IM chairman Mike Jay, is
“especially good for retired hip-
pies.”

Those of us who play a quiet
game or catch with a plastic disc
we have come to know and love as
a frisbee will undoubtedly be
caught up in this new craze

THE GAME IS. as you have
probably already guessed,
ultimate trlsbee and itis the up and
coming l‘risbee diversion. East
Coast ultimate trisbee competition
is on the intercollegiate level and
the game is played intramurally
all over the country.

This fastrmovmg game plays like
soccer on a football field with
extended end zones. Opposing
teams at seven players each try to
advance downficld by passing the
trisbce amongst themselves and,
ultimately. to score a point by
passing to a teammate in the
opponent’s end zone, It a pass is
incomplete, intercepted, knocked
down or goes out-of—bounds, the
defense gains possession and play
continues in the opposite direction.

FREE SUIISTITUTIDN .\l\'I) no
penalties (therefore no officialst
allow the game to be in continuous
motion, There are two 25-minute
halves of play and a tenrminute‘
halftime.

Mike Jay describes ultimate
frisbee as a lun game which is not
supposed to be overly organized or
competitive. Prerequisites lor
playing are the ability to throw and
Catch a frisbee and a little en»
durance [or running around, of
Course, those who can't do these
things are welcome to participate
anyway.

[“50 JAY ADDS, “You should
wear or own a McGovern button.”
Those showing up with “Nixon's
the one!" buttons will not be
allowed on the playing field but
may seek a pardon from Gerald
Ford,
