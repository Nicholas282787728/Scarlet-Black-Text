‘U.S. Imperialistic’
Chase Declares
at Sunday Club

"America is imperialistic, since it
pursued a colonization policy and
rules subject people," stated Philip
Chase, Harvard exchange professor,
in a talk before the Sunday Evening
club, in the Associations building on
Sunday night.

Mr. Chris , speaking on “American
Imperialism." confined his subject to
a discussion of American imperialism
in the Philippines and brief history of
the growth of the imperialistic idea.

He listed newspaper propaganda,
missionary influence, and England‘s
exhortations, because of fear that
India might seek freedom if the
Philippines were left alone, as rea-
sons, beside thc Spanish.American
war, for the United States interven-
tion.

In the open forum held after Mr.
Chase's lecture, he said that he
thought there was not much public
opinion on the Philippine question
and that “the Philippines will prob-
ably reject the present bill for inde-
pendence."

Students Hear

Wise Sunday

Rabbi

in Younger Generation

Decries Cynicism

Dr. Stephen S. Wise, Rabbi of the
Free synagogue, New York, answered
in an absolute affirmative his own
question, “Shall We Go on Caring?"
when he delivered last Sunday after-
noon's vesper address in Herrick
chapel.

Improvements in social and econ-,
omic orders were laid by Rabbi Wise
to this very are of one man for an-
other. Spec c instances given in-
cluded Florence Nightingale’s strug-
gle to organize war nurses in order
that wounded men might not suffer
on the battle-field for hours and days.

Established Red Cross

“It was she who made way for the
present Red Cross system," the
speaker declared, "and I believe that
the Red Cross, because of its inter-
national espect, was the precursor of
the League of Nations."

Rabbi Wise also mentioned the
Dreyfus treason case, in which a
young Jewish officer in France was
sentenced to Devil’s Island for a
crime of which he was innocent.
Some of his Jewish friends forgot
him, said Dr. Wise, but others fought
until he was released.

“Not only the life of one man, but

be cause of truth and the cause of
justice wcre at stake."

"A Clenucr New York"

Gandhi's sacrificial work in India
and his statement that “There is no
room on earth today for men who are
not free," were commended, and
bringing his illustrations closer home,
Dr. Wise mentioned the attempts of
himself, Judge Samuel Seabury and
others to “keep on fighting for a
cleaner New Yor

”Instead of a civic shrine. New
York is a city stye. Every manner of
vulgar y, debascment and dishonesty
is practiced there, but still we keep
on fighting."

mys Cynicism

Addressing the students in his and-
icnce, Dr. Wise declared that cyni-
cism is the unchallenging acceptance
of all that is bad, and asked, “Why
do young people continue to under-
estimate themselves?"

“Much of the trouble between the
older and younger generation," he
said, "co‘mcs because parents cannot
cease to care, and young people find
it easy not to care. Cynicism is pop-
ular with the younger generation."

Technocracy Theme in

mor magazine, The Malteaser, will be
