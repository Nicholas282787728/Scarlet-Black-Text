BETTER MEN; BETTER TEAMS

The new athletic system intro-
duced by Coach Brown deserves
the most loyal support of Grinnell
students. The realm of athletics is
two-fold: to physically better the
students and to serve as a means of
unifying the life of the institution.
'Ihe second aim, one that has often
been mistaken for the only one, lie»
pends largely upon the ﬁrst, and
while Grinnell has always been
notable in making athletics reach a
great proportion of the students
this new move will be a distinct
step toward the accomplishment of
both aims.

THE CAMPVFIRE.
By Alice Blaine Damrosch.

(El. l-i/botly's)
i see through drowsy lililtrclosed eyes
The sparks by twos and threes
Try to attain the disldnt sures,
And Vanish through the trees
Like golden hoes.

Hy tiles and threes i watch their track;
The branches mulls great bars

of black against the lesser black

of heaven, and thru those lizu':

I see the stars.

My eyes grow heaw one more spark
Mounts upward; it will be

A new star out there in the dark
That gazes down on me
Unblihkingly.

THE INNER PASSION.
By Alfred Noyes.

(The c. mini/1.

There is a Master in my heart

To u hom, though all against my will,
I bliug the songs I sing apart,

And strive to think that they rulhll
llis silent law, within my heart.

But he is blind to my desires
‘ And deaf to all that I would blond:
He tests my trulh at purer ﬁres

And shamrs my nurplc with his need.
He claims my deeds, not my desires

And olten. u lien my comrades praise,
I sadden; [or he turns from me!
But sometimes, when they blame.
raise
My eyes to his and in them see
A tenderness [00 decn for praise.

He is not to be [taught with gold,
0r lured by the thoruless Ll‘ou'us of

fame;
But when some rebel thought hath sold

Him to dishonor and to shame.

Compton Answers Question “Why
the ‘Y’ 7"

“Why the ‘Y‘ was the question
Cari Compton clearly answered in his
talk to the College men at the meeting
Thursday night. Two reasons readily
prove the need or such an institution;
because at u hat it can do for Gi'iuuell;
because or what it can do for the indi-
vidiml.

In the past the “Y" has proven neces-
s: y to G 'unell and shown itself to
be an organic part of the College, tho
it is entire - self-supporting, It has
din-a, stood for the best in Grim
hell, which we have grown to deﬁne as
the “Griunell Spirit." The “Y" as-
sceins the responsibility of acting as
host to the new men each year; its
harlols are always open to the men;
it secures a lecture course; holds stags
and woehl.‘ meetings in the Association
rooms. 135' means of its Bible Study
