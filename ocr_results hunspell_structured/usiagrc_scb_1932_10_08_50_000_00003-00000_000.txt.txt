Dux Will Sing
Here Oct. 2 l

Noted Soprano Will Open

Concert Series

Claire Dux, internationally known
srprano of the concert stage Rndl
grand opera, will open the recital
course here on Oct 21 at 3 o‘clock in
Herrick chapel,

As a very young woman Miss ’Dux
made her deput in the leading opera
companies of Europe, singing prima
donna roles at La Scala in Milan, the
Royal Operas of Sweden and Den»
mark, the Imperial Opera at Berlin
and Covent Garden, London.

Her singing won wide popular fa—
vor and such praise that several gave
ernments honomd her with royal
decorations.

Mary Garden subsequently signed
a contract with her to appear with
the Chicago Civic Opera company,
She made her debut there in ”La
Bohem " and “disclosed herself as one
of the three finest sopranos known
to this country," according to Eu—
gene Stinson of the Chicago Daily
Journal. ’

Miss Dux was born in Poland and
from early childhood planned to be a
“great singer." She was encouraged
by her paients with whom musical
tradition was very'strong. The young
singer's mother was a cousin of Clara
Schumann, wife of the composer, and
both she and her husband had mu-

, sical taste and ability.

The artist's professional debut took
place in Cologne. Caruso sang oppo-
. c her in her debut at Europe’s first
opera house, the German Imperial
Theatre. When Melba heard her in
Covent Garden she declared that she
had had “her first music 1255011"

Miss Dux has recently returned to
the concert stage after a brief retire
ment, following her marriage to
Charles H. Swift.

By MAX ROSS

Coach Watt lost a psychological
point which was expected to go in his
favor, when the powerful Michigan
eleven walked over Michigan State
for a 26—0 victory last week, Had the
State eleven held Michigan on even
terms, the Crinnell gme this week
would have been something of a let
down for them, but for be it from
such now, since Jun Crowley’s men
will be out to avenge their defeat of
last Saturday,

s

Two Big Ten teams, one of them
Michigan, piled up onerslded totals
over their non-conference opposition
last Saturday, but in each case the
game was closer than the score indi-
cated. The other encounter saw Dick
Hanley's Northwestern Wildcats score
three touchdowns in the last ten min-
utes to gain a 27-0 victory, after a
fighting University of Missouri team
had played them off their feet for
almost three full quarters.

Although Marquette has never
scored an actual victory over Wis-
consin on the gridiron, they earned a
moral victory last week. Wisconsin
won, H, but the Golden Avalanche
held the upper hand throughout, only
to have the Badgers score after a he-
covered fumble. AS the game ended,
Marquette had the ball on the Wis-
consin 53-yard line after Ronzani had
thrown a 22-yard pass in the closing
seconds. Another ininute would prob—
ably have seen the score reversed.

The [biggest upset of the week
came when the little Bates college
team from Lewiston, Maine, played
what was supposed to be one of the
greatest of Yale teams to a scoreless
tie. The Eli nearly scored in the clos-
ing minutes, but a courageous stand
in which the Bates forward wall
threw the Yale backs for a total loss
of nine yards after the Bulldogs had
reached the 1-yard stripe saved the
