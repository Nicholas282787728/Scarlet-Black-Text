Curiosity Leads

To Recovery _
Of Smith Plaque

by Stan Writer

The mystery surrounding the
disappearance two and a half
years ago of the brass name
plate from its place on the brick
entryway to Smith hall has
been solved. t

The solution, which sounds
more like an Ellery Queen pros
duct than those oi Queen him
self, seems only to add proof to
the adage that truth is a their
sand times stranger than fiction.

Elements in this mystery and
its solution include two former
Grinnell students now in the
army, their reunion in an army
camp in Virginia. a dirty Ven»
tilation shalt, and a fellow with
more curiosity than nine cats.

Bruce Snell, '51, a former
member of Smith hall, now in
the field artillery, supplied the
background and the clues to the
mystery when he visited Grin-
meu campus recently.

The mystery started one night,
two and a half years ago, when
the shiny nameplate bearing the
inscription “Jas. A. Smith Halls:
disappeared. Speculations of its
whereabouts pointed to either
the heating tunnel on south
campus, or the muddy depths of
Arbor lake. After two years.
with still no sign of the plaque,
many believed the latter.

Six weeks ago, two Grinnel-
lians now in the army met in
Camp Pickett, Va. Snell was one
of them. in the course of con-
versation, the other member ot
the GI, reunion laughingly told
about the time, way back when,t
he and several companions re-
moved the plaque from its posi»
tion beside the Smith door, and‘
hid it in a ventilator shaft int
ARH. i

Snell had doubts about the
validity oi the claim, but when,
he returned to visit Grinnell‘
recently. he simply passed on:
the story to some of the prescht‘
Smith hall’r’nembers. One or the,
men who heard the story, Nor-
man Lerch. Smith senior, bar
lieved there might be some
truth to the ventilator shalt
idea.

Lerch went to the prescribed
shaft in ARH, searched through‘
the dirt and refuse at the bot
tom ot the shaft, and came up,
with the long in _ ng plaque

At last, after being hidden‘
two and a half years in the‘
dusty depths of a ventilator
shaft in ARH. the Smith plaque.
shining as it used to, is back in,
its place i
