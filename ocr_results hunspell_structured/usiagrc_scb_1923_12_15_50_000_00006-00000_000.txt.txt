day social and intellectual unrest,

Loyd George write "The present
year has been one of growing gloom
land menoco. The international terns
per is worse all around.” General
Smuts, at the recent Imperial confeiu
once in London uttered these weighty
words; "The world is undoubtedly in
n bdd way. lnstond of peoples draw»
ing together as we hoped they would
alter the war, the tendencies are
the other way: the passions which
the war let loose src rampant every-
where, and if ever there was s time
when a helping hand was needed by
{the world, and by Europe especially,
it is now."

All eyes are turned to the United
states. In the words of'Eresidcnt
l-libhen of Princeton university," "We
are the only nlttiun which can play
lthe part of a mediator amidst oonliict-
ing claims and interests of European
suites, We lace a great opportunity
to use our power and inﬂuence 10 free
the world from the menace of another
world war."

It is in the light of these facts, and
in behalf of foreign missions as it
touches these issues, that the convene
tiou is to be held. Grinnell is play»

movement by sending nine delegates:
Walter Read, Ralph head, Charles
