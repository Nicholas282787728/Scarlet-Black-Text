Sweatshops and the Dark side of the Force

The scene is familiar. Luke Skywtllltet clutches his
brand new stump 1s d1ddv v1dL1 pitches the 131111
sidc ofthe Force Join me, Vader says, we can end
this destruettve conﬂict 1nd b. g order to the galaxy."
Luke, your typic1l ingryoe s father Jedi Knight,
dccides to fall rather thaii deny all that Obiswan and
Yoda taught him. But what if Luke had considered
Vader’s offer rationally, examining the pros and cons
of what it would mean to “know the power of the
Dark side?"

Like the Dark side, sweatshops are 11 black aitd cvil
force Everyone knows theyte jabbas 1rmpit- they re
hot, nasty and exploitative At one time, Gtinnells
own Students Against Sweatshops led a rcbellion
1g1inst the empire otswe1tshops 111 developing courts
tries and 1cross the gulm-y But 11111? Are swe1tshops
as bad as Death Stilts? Let the Dark side tempt us for
just a moment.

So swe1tshops 1re bid for workers, hull? Sure,
the hours me long and the p1y is low. so why would
1nyone work there.) seriously consider the question.
If sweatshops renlly treot employees like Ewoks in 1
meet pit, then why would they submit to it.>

Employ some Dark side logic here. Sweatshops
11L espeeiully popular in undeveloped countiies,whele
unemployment is high 1nd wages 1rc low. A sweat»
shop provides jobs, 11d oftentimes p1ys highcrrtlmnr
average wages to 1ttrset reli1blc labor. Ifwotking in 1
swe1tshop is more proﬁtable than other available jobs
like farming, begging, or stealing, the choice is my
Even ifa sweatshop pays less, it’s still a huge step up
irom unemployment. Any job is better th1n 1 bad one
when you're trying to feed your family. The money
from these jobs is used to buy fundamentals like food,
healthcare and education. Local communities beneﬁt
from the new income, and the 111tion beneﬁts from
taxes on income 111d exports.

“Sounds tempting," you might s1y. But lemel‘nr

ber Yodas warning to Luke once you st1ttt down
the Bat p1th forevci will it dominate youl tiesttny. '
Despite thL cryptic g1 111111111, we should been his cau—
tion and considci the Light sides aritunicnts against
swe1tshops before we commit ourselves to Lithei side
or the galactic struggle,

od, they creme 1 “race
to the bottom," where
labor standards are sac-
rificed in the name of
low costs.

Unfortunately, there is a substantial dearth of
evidence Supporting this position Moreover 1 study
condutted by the Organization rot Economic co opt
er1tion 1nd Development round th1t lowerLd 11bo1
st1nd11rds were actually 11ssoe11ted with improvements
in labor conditions, such as decreased discrimination
in the workplace and reduced use ofchild labor.

The best aigument against this claim comes from
the pl1ces one would most expect gross hbor 1nd cnr
vironment11 1buses, in deregulated 1re1s est1blished
by countries to facilitate production and trade called
Export Processing Zones (EPZs).The International
L1bout Organization found no evidence th1t the
presence ofa strong trade-union discouraged foreign
investment.The World Bank found a strong positive
relntionship between foreign investment in EPZs 1nd
occupational safety. Other studies found that wages
in EPZs were greater than in other parts ofthe couri-
try. These ﬁndings me like 1 lightsaber to the head
ofLight side arguments, reducing feats ofdownward
spiraling pructiees to little more th1n wh1t wus left of
ObisWan after Darth Vader let him taste red.

Another argument those pesky rebels 1n1ke is th1t

cotnp1nies should piy swcntshop employees 1 liv-
ing wane, which is the amount that allows 11 pt .on
to live in 11 degree of comelt. Though tllcmcticalli

Fur worse 1111n swenshops 1s the l1ck of them.
A UNICEF study found that when the U.S. banned
imports from countries wh1eh used child labor in
their production, an estimated 37,000 cllildren in the
Asian subrcontlnelit turned to stone-cmshingstreee
hustling, and prostitution. The report st1ted mm the
alternatives to sweatshops were “more hazardous and
exploitative" than swe1tshops Now what were those
rebels siying about sweatshops exploiting people?

Sweatshop jobs are by no means fun, but that
is 1 luxury of living in 11 highly developed economy
Comfort comes at a cost that many billions ofpeor

Yoda said “Anger, teir, aggression, The Dark side

Lesson to take home: Get involved

Over the p1st sen1tster.tlns column
has been ill 11er the pl1ee l huve joked
about crazy Presidenthl candidates,
reﬂected on tragedies, called fol more
politie1l involvement, and analyzed the
Iowa Cau-
cuscs. Now,
in the twir
light of my
life as an
$88 colt
umnist, I
will finally
get to the point ol’whnt I’ve been s1y
ing this whole time.

Over the next several months, Iowa
is going to be swarmed with campaign
staff, media, and presidential candi-
dates. You will mm on CNN and see
reporters and pundits standing in front
of comﬁclds, MaidsRites, and moms
andrpop shops in Iowa. Relish 1t. Iowa
becomes the center ofthe political uni-
verse for 1 few months every tour years,
