REMODEL CHILD
ART ROOMS HERE

Many Innovations Made In Studio
During Vacation Period.

The Child Art Rooms, for ﬁfty years
the headquarters for all sorts of ar~
tistic work, have taken advantage of
the summer vacation to remodel and
improve the appearance of their stu-
dio on Broad stret. The chief change
is the construction of a balcony in the
rear of the store which provides room
for a private cftice on the second
floor and clears the way down stairs
{or the construction of new dressing
rooms and for the installation of new
lighting features and display rooms.
The interior has been redecorated in
soft gray with dark trimmings so that
a very restful eftcct is produced. The
windows are to be draped to carry out
the color comhlnation, making a de-
clded improvement in the interior of
the studio, ‘

Mr. A. L. child, six, the founder of
the Child Art Rooms was one or the
ﬁrst of the present business men to
settle in Grinnell and he has built

 

up a large trade with the college stu— l

dents and thruout the state in the
years that he has been here. His stu-
dio is filled with many old master-
pieces and he has built up an art col—
lection of which he may well be
proud.
