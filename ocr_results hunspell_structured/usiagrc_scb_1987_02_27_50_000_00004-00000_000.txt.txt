Marshall believes that “there‘s
something very special about small iowns
Many uiour nation's leaders got their start
in small towns. I think small towns are imr
portant to Americans because there is a
spirit or independence in small towns and a
certain amount of [reedom " Marshall is
originally from Cedai Rapids. but has
spent 25 years in Hartt‘ord. Connecticut

logical for Grinnell to hold a symposium on
small towns because it has witnessed llrstr

Marshall did comment that Grinncll
seemed to be better olt than the surroun-

Deminott stressed that iust because the
