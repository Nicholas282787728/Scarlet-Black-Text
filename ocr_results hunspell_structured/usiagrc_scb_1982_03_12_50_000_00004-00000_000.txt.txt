Although the following note appeared in Tuesday’s Memo in order to
make the community aware of recent incidents of harassment on cam-
pus, we feel the hypocrisy of the statement must be pointed out:

Recently several instances of verbal harassment have come to my atten-
tion. Some of the incidents have been racial or ethnic. To say that this
behavior is shocking is an understatement. Grinnell’s support or human digui»
ty and justice has been central to its life from the beginning. We lose our way
it we lose these values. I know that the college community joins me in condem—
ningthese attacks. It is worth remembering that verbal as well as physical in-
timidation is a violation of stated college policy. — President George Drake

In light of the recent issues involving Grinnell employees Mark
Grundler and Dave Renaud of Computer Services and Daniel Magnr-
shak, assistant professor of philosophy, Drake’s comments seem con-
trary to the ways in which Grinnell really operates. How can Renaud
and Grundler have been dealt with justly when they still maintain that
their dismissals were not adequately explained? And how can they have
been treated with dignity if Grundler can say after his appeal, “You
would think he [Drake] didn’t even read my statement, it clearly
countered all charges known to me at this time.” (3&8, Feb 26,)

Magurshak has also not received dignity and justice in protesting and
appealing the Executive Council’s decision to deny him tenure. Pro-
fessor Emeritus of Mathematics George Apostle’s involvement is clear-
ly unjust, Magurshak’s dignity has been slighted, too, by the council
members, who would rather listen to a man with no connection to the
philosophy department than the recommendation of his students, col-
leagues at Grinnell and peers who can be found only outside this institu-
tion.

And come on, Mr. Drake, what abovt divestment? You told the March
1 faculty meeting that the Board of Trustees’s decision to reaffirm its
1973 investor responsibility ruling “was reached by no means lightly.
We agonized over it over two meetings." It is clear that you and your ad-
ministration, just like the 200 students who protested this decision Feb.
6, realize the moral implications of Grinnell’s investments in South
Africa, And, of course, you must have heard that 80 percent of the coun-
try’s population is black but are excluded from governing the nation or
sharing human rights with the white minority.

If the patterns established this academic year continue, the terms
“human dignity" and ”justice” must be disassociated with Grinnell Col~
lege. At the present time, the leaders of this college are walking in a
dark, thick fog — and because these values are being ignored, we will all
lose our way. Soon. '

Violence i0 women
IlBGIlIIIilIﬂ a
Grinnell tradition .

Tradition is that wonderful sense of continuity and nostalgia 7 of
shared experiences we can live again and again. Grinnell certainly has
its share of traditions and one seems to be the theme of rape. Rape
seems to pop up every time Grinnellians gather for» fun.

On the entrance of Darby Gym’s Loose Hall Ball this year was a mock
wanted poster with the mug of a Grinnell student. After listing his
aliases, the poster described his notorious deeds, including “Rape . . ,
and rape, (he likes rape).” As there are legal sanctions against the en-
joyment and practice of rape, I assume this was someone’s idea of
humor. However, I find the humor missing. Harking back to last
semester’s debate over the name of the James Hall party, the connec-
tion between fun and rape is completely offensive and insensitive. There
is nothing funny about violence to women.

Some “consciousness raising” for Grinnell College seems to be in
order. The intolerance and insensitivity recently displayed on campus,
as also mentioned in President George Drake’s message in the most re-
cent Memo, is in itself intolerable. Institutionalized remnants like the
name James Gang Bang are tradtions we can do without, Let’s shoot
down this “tradition” immediately.

Since we are now in election and budgeting season, it would seem pro-
per to have‘James Hall agree to change the name of the party or the
funds should be allocated to a hall such as Rawson which would not find
a gang bang ”fun.” Clearing up this matter would be a fitting first task
for the new $GA administration. ‘ Seth Meiul
