IS COL EGE {RETREATI
In recent years American colleges have been sub-
jected to a vigorous fire of criticism. It is not the pura
pose of this article to add to the general clamor which is
already general enough, but to point to Certain basic facts
which are too often overlooked.
The first is that the hope of the future lies in educa-

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

tron. Tile second is that education must he irected n

diticrcnt channels than heretofore.

George Patrick quotes IL president of one of our great
American universities in a speech typical of the com-
rnon viewpoint ot the purpose or education. He says,
“The university is a temporary retreat from the world
where young men and young Women may breathe the
air or lr-eedorn and achieve emancipation from the obso»
lete dogmas. the unworthy loyalti , and irrational inhir
hitions, the tribal ccntormities, and the cowardly cau-
tions that crush and kill tlr cducated man."

No “ise man would dispute the relevancy of educa-
tion to the iuturc oi the world, but we are inclined to
disagree with the opinion of this learned man. .Rittllnr
it should he said that the collegeis a part or the life or
the present, where young people may seek an outlet for
their social and intellectual impulses.

Consider Gr-inncll, with its Spirit, its traditions, its
iaculty, its curriculum, and its lite. Here We may learn
the fundamentals of the social sciences, acquire a coin-
pletc understanding ot.ethlcs, and cultivate respect [or
the laws or the school, state and nation, and finally un-
derstand the necessity of discipline. We must conform
to the limitations or society. John Locke declared that
ill the dim [lawn of history man was born free, but now
is everywhere in chains. The situation extant on our
campus ElllpilﬂSlJZS the need ior this attitude or can,
iorirrity to social obligations. Restrictions of this type
are inherent in our social structure, a root which might
well be borne in mind when we would chart under such
lenient rriles as student government imposes.

\Vc oi Griuncll must not develop a spirit of doubt and
alootues that would ostracize us from the world out-
side our walls. Rather should we awaken from our
apathy and develop a spi t of cooperation and a sense
of responsibility to society. College should not cause us
to lose track or the world, rather it should help us get
in touch with it.

RED 'CAI’S.

To members of the senior Class who were loathe to
see the venerable custom of "prepping” put on the shelf
With other obsolete practices, the sight of red caps must
indeed be “It Sight for sore eyes." After a. winter of im-
precedcnied emancipation the freshmen emerge, scarlet
topped and sleek, bearing no signs of the paddle which
was wont to swing in the dead of winter. We are privir
leged it) say that l’Obins might he 1 harbinger of spring,
but rod calls are a sure sign of lots of attention on a
rainy day.
