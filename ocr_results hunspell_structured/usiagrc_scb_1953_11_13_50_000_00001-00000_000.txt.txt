ter proposing a two week sus-
pension for the first offense,
semester suspension for the
second offense, and permanent
expulson for the third offense,
but he felt that the penalty
should remain as stated. It
should be the basis under which
people operate.

circumstances. I prefer to make
my mistakes on the side of in-
telligent, humane treatment.”

He also stated that all cases
of suspension were reviewed by
him personally.

He went on to say that both
penaltysadjustments were evi—
dence for the fact that the ad-
ministration has failed to show
that their intent is not punitive,
but the development of stu-
dents. He asserted that the two
students had shot themselves
off lrom sympathetic treatment
by the administration by fail.
ing to consult them about the
problems involved before they
were apprehended. He conclud-
ed “Until this is understood, ‘ex—

Reply Requested
To Council Letter

At the regular meeting of the
Student Council held last night,
John Leetz, Lang-an junior, was
named as producer of this year's
student musical.

A letter will be sent to Dean
Fuller proposing that double
cuts take the place of triple
cue, due to the new three-hour
class system.

A followup letter will be
sent to Dr. Stevens asking him
to explain and clarify the pen-
alty system for car rule and
drinking violations. The Council
has requested a reply to their
letter sent to the President last
week, which protested against
inconsistencies and dborepancies
of the system, and which asked
for valid exceptions to the stated

which were less severe.
