Judicial

admendment

proposed

A constitutional amendment has
ieen written to change Grinncll’s
udicial process,

The Committee on Judicial
leform Created the bill to increase
:fficiency and consistency in the
ystem by reducing the number oi
:ouncils involved and more clearly
lefining the power and jurisdiction
ii remaining bodies.

The amendment calls tor
lbolishment of the North and South
Iampus Judicial Councils and
nvestment of SGA’s judicial power
n the College Judicial Council and
he Office of Community Rights.

According to Bob Jacobs, the
amendment was created in an
effort to resolve the confusion and
conilict which prevailed during the
judicial proceedings oi two in-
cidents this year. He said there
was “poor understanding about
how the judicial council should be
run." SGA President Will Collins
said there was also conﬂict bet
ween the council and the office, He
said each was trying to do the

’ other’s job. The identity of the
incidents is being kept con-
fidential.

The College Judicial Council
would be similar to the Campus
Judicial Council now in existence.
except that it would acquire the
responsibilities of the North and
South Campus Judicial Councils.
The amendment calls for it to have
jurisdiction over ”violations ocs
curring on campus or in Colleges
owned housing oi any student‘s
rights, residence hall rules, or
College regulations," it may
impose punitive sentences such as
fines or suspensions, or
rehabilitative ones such as
counseling.

It will consist of two faculty
members and five students. The
teachers will be selected by the
college president irom a list of
suggested names drawn up by the
Joint Board and the Dean of
Student Affiars. Under present
rules, the list is drawn up by the
faculty chairman. The student
selection process of choosing
members from applications sub
mitted to the Joint Board will not
be changed under the bill.

Associate Dean of Student At»
ia‘rrs Bob Jacobs said the for-
mation of the new council will help
to assure that the judicial process
is handled in the same way every
time. He added that he thought
having an eiiicient system was
especially important now because
more students are starting to file
charges when they think their
rights have been violated. He
called this a “positive sign ”

The otiice oi Community Rights,
which is part of the current
system, remains almost uns
Changed under the bill. but its
power and jurisdiction are more
clearly defined.

The office will be a mediating
body for instances ill which both
parties agree to seek resolution
outside the judlmal process or
instances in which the College

Judicial Council refers a case to it.
It may not hand down sentences

1i an accused person has a
previous disciplinary record, or is
on conduct warning or probation at
the time of accusation, the hill
states that the case is not eligible
for mediation and must be handled
by the council.

The office, which will consist oi
six students, two Resident Ad-
visors, and a member of the oriice
oi Student Affairs, as it does now,
will also be responsible ior
providing counsel it either side
requests it. The selection process
of members will not be changed
under the amendment.

According to the bill, appeals,
which are now made to the Campus
Judicial Council, will be made to
the President oi the College,

There is some question as to

'when the amendment should be

brought before the Joint Board.
Some people would like to see the
bill approved this school year,
whereas others would prefer to
wait until next Semester.

Collins would like to Wait. He
said he is not sure if he is comv
pletely satisfied with the bill. He is
worried that it does not clarity the
process of bringing charges about.
He does like having faculty
members as part oi the council.

“1 think you need saner heads
than the student body involved,”
he commented. However, he said
he is concerned about possible
political problems with the app
pointment of the faculty members.

Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman agrees that faculty
council members are good. He said
they add “some dignity.” He also
said that since students have been
asking ior more voice in iacuity
matters, the faculty should have
more voice in student affairs. He
added that he thought Collins'
worry about political difficulties in
the appointment process was
“unfounded.”

Tederman said he likes the
amendment overall. “It is much
better than what we have now,” he
said. He said he especially likes the
opportunity provided by the oiiice
to resolve problems outside the
judicial system by “sitting down at
a table and talking about them."
However, he added that while the
structure would help to make an
efficient process, having good
people in the system would be the
most important factor.

He admitted that there was not
enough time this school year to
approve the bill and start the
process mvoing, but he said he
thought it would be possible to
establish the structure by ape
proving the amendment, and
would like to see this happen.

The bill must pass the Joint
Board by a majority vote and then
must be ratified by at least ($0 per
cent of a student vote Then, it
must be approved by the President
of the College, if it passes these
steps, it will replace Article in,

Joint

boards
meet

Wednesday night, the attendance
at the SGA Joint Board meeting of
197571975 hall representatives
oiiicially completed the transier oi
power to the new student govern
ning body. Will Collins. president,
opened the meeting with an in
troduction oi the new reprcscn-
tatives and a short resume of what
the job of a representative entails.
He encouraged representatives not
to limit themselves to just ate
tending SGA meetings regularly
and keeping the tire extinguisher
full, but also to be concerned with
the general well being of the hall
through organizing irequent hall
meetings where issues can be
discussed and opinions gathered.

The representatives were
elected Sunday ior most oi the
halls, amidst rumors that some
nominees were persuaded to run
by Will Collins and his staff. As
Will explained it, he and his
cabinet did go through the list of
next year’s halls residents, seeking
names oi people they ielt would

contribute towards a healthy SGA.

In past years it was felt that the
Joint Board was weakened by the
inactivity of some members, and
that this “bug in the ear” was used
to encourage qualified people to
run who might not otherwise do so,
However, when questioned about
being asked to run by Collins, all of
the newly elected representatives
spoken to agreed that the reasons
to run were personally motivated.
Most felt that they had something
to contribute to recent curriculum
change, budget cut proposals, and
bringing about greater student
activism in SGA.

After the opening remarks the
meeting proceeded to the ap
proving of the Cabinet positions.
Selection of the Cabinet is done by
the outgoing president, the
outgoing vice president, and the
incoming president, with the Joint
Board having iinal approval.

Due to illness, Joe Ferrell,
candidate for Student Coordinator
was unable to attend the meeting,
so the motion of approval was
tabled until the next meeting.
Michael Gelbort and Jay Michaud
were approved as Assistant
Student Coordinators. Both agree
that one oi the major things they
will be concerned with as Assistant
Student Coordinators is the im»
proving and redeiining oi
relationships among ad-
ministrators, iaculty. and
students.

The last three llominecs to the
Cabinet were approved with little
delay. Patty Mayer was accepted
as secretary, Mark Nissen as
treasurer, and Mike Herman as
student auditor.

Before adjourning the meeting
Uireecommittecs were formed. the
Finance Committee with six
members, the Nominating Cour
niiltce for All-Campus Judicial
Council with four members, and
the Nominating Committee for the
Social Coordinating Colnlnittcc
