Franzenburg Visits Grinnell

by John Wylie

Paul Franzenburg, Democratic
candidate tor the Iowa Governorship,
was in Grinnell brieﬂy last week
on what he called “an inlormal
stopover between scheduled appear-
ances.” He Spent his Grinnell visit
talking with students over lunch in
the dining halls and the Forum Grill.

In between visits with students in
Cowles, Franzenburg gave the SSLB
an informal interview about a few
oi the issues he is conironting in
his campaign with incumbent Repub-
lican Governor Robert Ray.

Primary emphasis oi the dis
cussion with the former StateTrea—
surer centered on the problems
laced by out of state college stue
dents, who must decide whether to
vote in Iowa or in their home
state in the upcoming General Elec-
tlon,

“We must break the barrier on
student voting”, Franzenburg told
us He added that the problem was
a complex one, with many iacets,
but that solving it is important to
the State,

Franzenburg added that he was
disappointed that so many students
were planning to vote in their home
states even though they spend none

months out oi the year in Iowa.
“I would think, that, ior some-
one who spends nine months out

oi the year in lowa. the wav this
state is run would be oi great

importance. I would think that such
students would want to vote here
instead oi another state,”
Franzenburg continued, however,
that students could not expect to
have the system work both ways ior

them. “We Can‘t have the best of
both worlds in this case. I am
thinking at the moment about the
idea that a person should vote in
the state where he spends the ma~
Jority oi his time. In the case at
a college student here, that would
mean voting in Iowa. But there
are a lot oi aspects to the prob—
lem I do know thiS--the barrier
must be broken,”

“I'm also not at all suriapout the
30 day residency requirement", he
told us. We mentioned the case oi
Philosophy Instructor Thomas
Davis, which is presently beiore the
Iowa courts. Franzenburg did not
comment on the speciiic case, but
again expressed his doubts about the
disputed requlretnent.

Alter chatting tor a few moments
more at a side table in Cawles, one
of the candidate’s aides arrived to
remind him of another obligation
elsewhere. Franzenburg rose.I to
leave, promising to return (or a
formal campaign stop at Grinnell
it possible, although noting that no
formal promise Could be made since
“it is still nine weeks until the
election,"

ISPIRG REPRESENTATIVES MEET WITH NFO

by Anne Walter

Members oi the ISPIRGState Board
were invited to the Iowa State Na—
tional Farmer's Organization meet,
ing Saturday night, September 2,
in Ames. The dinner, a captivating
banquet, was a folksy affair. Every-
one with any importance received
a standing ovation. ISPIRG’S Exe-
cutive Director, John Neubauer,hoth
sat at the head table and spoke while
all of us were introduced.

The NFO isan organization otsmalt
tarmers who are attempting to pre
vent iarm prices from hitting rock
bottom by the process of collective
bargaining. They are frustrated by

the fact that farm prices have
changed very little in 20 years,
while the cost of maintainig alarm
operation have increased several-
told.

The NFO seesthesmalliarmerbe—
ing put out or business-ethe small
towns following suit as there is
nothing to support them. They are
irightened by large agribusiness
companies, such as Del Monte, that
own or buy irom thousands oldesig»
hated acres annually. Someiarmers
were organic and others were libr
eral users at pesticides and fertilie
zers. Among the latter it was sur-
prising to discern several who
Iavored the recent ban on DES (diev

thylstilbestrol~a cancer—producing
estrogen agent), which is used by
most cattle producers to produce
marketable Cattle taster.

John Neubauer’s speech was light,
and he assured our hosts of our
concern with the plight 01 the small
tarmer. At dinner students and
farmers had lively conversations,
and many NFO people stayed alter,
ward to talk with LlSu For the most
part we were sought aiter, not vice-
versa.

The issues raised by the NFO are
only a small segment or Iowa prob-
lems. Even so, these issues are
fundamental to the social structure
and economy oi this state.

 

ISPIRG from pagel

motion. Decisions pertaining to
these matters, discussed in detail
on the ﬂoor, were made by the
student board members; the staff
members, tor the most part, con~
tributed their opinions only when
asked directly to express them.
As Karen Auerbacn noted, “The
ISPIRG hired staff is extremely imr
Dressive, However, the Sta“ is not
running the organization" Ms.
Wynn echoed these thoughts: “The
stall is providing good assistance
right now, but we are all aware

that this must not become leader
ship. The extenet of student respon—
sibllity in making caretul choices
seemed to give hope that we will
maintain our control,”

In assessing ISPIRG's potential for
eiiective action in the coming
months, Ms. Wynn believes that,
“The main problem in the next
year Will be whether campus inter
est and support can be sustained
despite ISPIRG’S focus on organi—
zational and educational issues.
not being triumphant attacks on big
issues, students may withdrawtheir
support."
