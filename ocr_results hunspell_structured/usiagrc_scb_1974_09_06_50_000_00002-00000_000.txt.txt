B urling fools fowls

periodically, especially in
summer and during tall migration,

carcasses. This annual situation
does not have to persist. An

ISPIRG Sets goals for year

byJanetPopc

Along with numerous other
organizations, the Iowa Student
Public Interest Research Group
ilSPIRGl held its first meeting
last week. Over so people attended
the meeting, making Grinnell’s
ISPIRG leader very optimistic
about this year's projects. Mat
|hew Heine, local chairperson,
explained that the group claims to
have Weekly or bisweekly
meetings. Next week’s meeting
will be held Tuesday, Sept. 10 at
ma p.m, in Herrick basement.

Michael Reinemer, treasurer,
said that there hasn’t been much
interest shown in lSPIRG in the
last iew years, “People have been
turned off, thinking the group was
plastic and false. Tonight tat the
organizational meeting) a lot oi
freshmen were here. They haven’t
had time to adopt the cynicism oi
the uppeiclassmen,” he com-
mented.

“ , . . the underlying ISPIRG
objective is to build independent
basis or citizen power and change
the balance of public verses
private interest in society," ex-
plained a minicographcd sheet
handed out at the iii-st meeting. To
develop this citizcn power ISPIRG
works on various projects every
year. The leadership oi ISPIRG at
Grillnell stressed that this year's
projects would he ones that people
wanted to get involvcd in

Many suggestions Vior possible
projects were brought, up at the
meeting. Among them were: a

Continuing effort in the ‘Ban the
Can’ campaign aimed at
discouraging use oi aluminum
cans as containers tor beverages;
work on a nuclear energy
moratorium, breaking bit the
Highway Trust Fund, so that
money reserved solely for road
repair Could be used instead for
such needs as mass transit, and
support of a land-use policy for
Iowa's Grade A soil.

Activities

Students wishing to lobby at the
state legislature in Des Moines will
have opportunity-to do so in
committee this tall, and during the
official legislative session, starting
in January and lasting until
sometime in May.

0n the local level, ISPIRG
members will be working on
recycling, both in town and at the
college, “There’s probably a
goldmine we could do for the town
of Grinnell We have a lot of ideas
but we haven’t felt the community
out real well,” commented Carol
Tuttle, who worked as an ISPIRG
summer intern,

There are 12 other iSPIRG
groups operating at colleges and
universities throughout iowa.
Their main office is located in Des
Moines where ISPIRG has a fairly
large professxonal Staff.

The state organization also
consists of a State Board made up
oi representatives irom the
jvarious lspmo‘groups around the
state. Deirdre Smith is Grinnells

representative. This board coorc
dinates actions on the local
campuses, decides which projects
organizations should work on and
balances the state budget.

iiistory

The idea for the lSPlRG groups
was originated about five years
ago by Ralph Nader. consumer
advocate. He challenged students
in the nation's schools to channel
their concern ior social issues into
constructive action. Thereupon,
Don Ross, Nader's right-hand man
organized the groups. Iowa's PIRG
was organized about three years
ago.

The History of ISPIRG came up
at the meeting, along with
discussions oi last year’s ac-
complishments and this year's
goals, Various questions were
asked of the executive board, and
interest seemed to run high. Ex-
pressing her teelings to those
assembled, Carol Tuttle stated,
“There’s a lot you can gain from
this organization, a lot you can give
to it.”

REGRETS

The SGA Cabinet wishes
to express its regrets
that the reierendnm on dog
policy could not be held
Wednesday as scheduled,
due to mixup in
arrangments for the vote.

Produced as a decal and pasted on
the windows, the falcon‘s outline
irightens away the birds, ac-

cording to designers.

Presently, the deaths of nature’s
aviators is not at the top of
anyone’s priority list, Christopher
McKee, head librarian, has no
objection to the decals. He did
voice doubt about the talcon's
aesthetic appearance. However, he
also noted the possibility of the
decals having the impression of a
flock of birds taking off.

Thus, aesthetically and by
saving lives, the so-called “Shoo
Bird” could kill two birds with one
decal. Money ior the experimental
project would have to be obtained
through Dean Walker’s oiiice,
pending his approval,

The Shoe Bird was designed to
warn migrating birds oi “in~

Registration location counts

by Matt Cohen
As Election day approaches,
those Grinnell students not living
in iowa will have to decide whether
to vote by absentee ballot in the
hometown election or at Grinnell.

However, in deciding where to
vote, students should be aware that
they may lose citizenship in their
home state by voting in iowa.

Registration

Some will undoubtedly dismiss
the possibility of voting in Grinnell,
arguing that they are registered
elsewhere or do not want to
register here. This, however, is not
a problem this year. Any student
who is 18 and has proper iden-
tificatiun can vote in the upcoming
election. The student simply has to
go to the polling place on Election
day, with identification, and lie-she
will be allowed to Vote, (In-
formation on polling places will be
provided at a later date), The
student can not Vote bath in
Grinnell and at home, however.

while some may justify avoiding
the Grinnell election because oi
registration difficulties, others
may argue that Grinnell, iowa
elections are of relatively little
importance. These local and
statewide campaigns should not be
ignored,

Electoral impact

Obviously. a vote from iowa can
have just as much impact in the
House or Senate as a vote from
Illinois or New York. When the roll
call is taken, it matters not where
the Senator or Congressman is
from. but how he votes

A vote in the Iowa senatorial
election has relatively greater
impact when one- considers the
Iowa pool of eligible voters is
smaller than many other states.
This is exemplified by the 195i
Senate race, in which a change of
votes by the student bodies of, for
example, Grinnell, Coe, and
Cornell Colleges would have
resulted in the defeat of Harold
Hughes and the election of David
Stanley (Hughes won by a margin
of 6,000 votes). This is not to Say
that this would have been desirable
or undesirable, but simply to
suggest the impact that a large
student turnout can have.

' LocalEleclions ‘

Such a turnout could have a
greater effect upon Grinnell and
Poweshiek County election results.
These results are of great ims
portance to us both directly, in
terms of policies pertinent to the
College, and indirectly, in terms of
the general Welfare of the town and
the positive or adverse effects
which that could have on the
College. in the long run, every
elected oificial plays a part in
shaping the lives and attitudes of
the electorate which he represents.
The direction these attitudes will
take will thus be determined by the
honesty, effectiveness, and
political bent of our elected of-
iicials.

One should not automatically
decide to vote here, nor ignore the
possibility. The decision should be
based on an assessment oi’where
onejs VoteJS mdst needed and will
have the greatest impact.
