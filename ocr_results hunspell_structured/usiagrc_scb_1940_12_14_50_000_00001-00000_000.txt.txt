Thursday Night

By Esther Carlson

chapel Thursday evening. J. Foi‘u

ance.

The cxccilcncc of the soloists
iias the most notable feature of
the production. Paul Morrison's
tenor voice lacked volume. but
Charlotte Madson, soprano, ‘Elmct
Isles, contralto, antl John Pow‘cll,

cspccicily, projected some of the
power and grandeur necessary to
an effective rendition of tlic ornr

The entirc chorus interpreted
the difﬁcult cho .il selections
u'ltll fiiicsse and beauty. Some»
tinics the music appeared todmg,
but this was due more to the inc
lierent qualities of the selection
rather than to the interpretation
given to it by the glce clubs,

Although only in the “Hailchi-

production, was there really a

By Russell Cain

for the Gl'lnnell campus, Pres. Samuel N. Stevens announced

this evening.

the recreational unit proposal last fall, will be built upon the
site originally specified, North and East of the present men’s

The decision to l'eVClL‘ to
the orginal building plans
was made after the board 01'

one unit of the ol glnally pro»
posed structure,

Dr. Stevens expressed satis-
faction for the broad mindeds
ness of the Grinnell students
in taking the action which
brought about the petition
that was submitted to the
heard today. Stevens also
represented the trustees as
being definitely pleased and
influenced by the character
of the Grinnell students with
whom they had lunch this
noon.

The action of the trustees
definitely assures the build-
ing of the f ~st unit of the
structure, which will include
a full size basketball floor
and a seating capacity of

these terrible days, when the spirit of Anti-
