In 1882 a cyclone swept over 0111' Collegn
campus, devastating the buildings and apparatus
until scarcely one stone was left upon another.
Physical results of years of toll, the labors of a
quarter of a century, the wealth gathered and
donated by the sacriﬁce of God-loving humani-
tarians, who had attempted to provide for a broad
and liberal education, lay scattered and useless
over our beautiful campus. But tho labor was
lost the golden grain was wasted in broken bricks
and Spllnteled wood the spirit of the founders
could not be Shaken.

In 1889, just seven years after this terrible
calamity swept our College campus, appeared
another Cyclone, but different in nature and ma-
terial substance from its predecessor of 1882. The
Cyclone of 1889 was constructive rather than de—
structive. The sway of the Cyclone of 1889 cov—
ered human life and swept over avast territory.
Its breezes were felt in many homes, even in dis—
tant states and lands.

Sometime in the spring of 1918 another Cy-
clone will Visit our College campus as fragrant as
the spring ﬂowers. It will have its touch of ‘philo-~
sophical sadness and will blim at times with pa-
thos; but will Clown botll moods with a quasi-
happy ending, in a manne‘r as modem as it IS cy-
clonic. It often happens that a cyclone tears down
a good man’s cottage, while the mansions of the
wicked near by remain untouched. ”One shall be
taken and the other lef ” If YOU are left it will
be but a freak of the “elements.” '
