INTRODUCING THE
SUCCESSOR TO
THE FLAPPER.

iMiss Youngest is grow-
ing up. She is taking on a
sweet dignity and a femi-
nine charm. She is becom-
ing the appealing young
womhn and leg the boyish
maiden. She is just as en-
thusiastic and just as much
alive with the joy of living '
but she certainly has
changed her manners anal
HER CLOTHES. ‘

~‘1‘he longer skirts for one
thing make quite at differ-
ence and the hats are
unlike those We have seen.
The French influence is
seen and felt ill/all the
Autumn apparel.

CLOTHED, IN HER
RIGHT MIND AND 'A
NEW CORSET

¥Tll£|tls the way a girl
wants to greet the new
scekon. A corset worn all '
slimmer is hardly equal to
,the task of giving her-'Fell
Suit the required lines.
And though the New
Frock appear floppy, n
trim (:Ol‘SCtPLl ﬁgure is still
it necessary foundation for
the fashionable shaps.

—Doii’t think wearing
new corsets moon's sacriﬁo
lug any of your beloved
freedom. Far from it—tlle
new ones are made of
light, comfortable ma»
tel‘izils and the foil" stays
are soft and pliable. And,
because there is less to
them, corsets are selling at
much lower prices.
