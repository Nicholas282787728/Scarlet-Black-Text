Our Honor? - -

, The infant honor system of Grinnell
has been put to a rigid test, and seems to
have barely squeezed by, if it passed at all.
There were many violations in this semes-
ter‘s final examinations. What is wrong
With out honor system, that it has not stood
up in the same way as old established hon—
or systems have at the University of Vir-
ginia, West Point, and other institutions?

In our opinion, there are two basic

weaknesses. One lies with the individual
student, and one with the Honor Coult.

The student has not done his part in
enforcing the honor system. Too many have
seen violations, and out of a mistaken sense
of loyalty to classmates and a desire to be
“a good kid”, have failed to report these
Violations, But if the honor system is to be
effective, no would—be violator should feel
that he can disobey the student-established
rule under the eyes of a roomful of fellow
students. Violations mustibe reported by
students out of a true loyalty to classmates,
a loyalty that will not tolerate the cheat,
and will not give him an advantage over his
honest fellow student

The second weakness is in the honor
courti Some Violations have not been quick-
ly and drastically punished, and the few that
have, have been hushed up so that no one
is aware of the fact that the honor system
is operating for the protection of all who
want fair play

The honor system is to the advantage

of the entire student body. We fought to

win faculty approval, and finally got it be—
cause the faculty and administration had
confidence in our integrity. We can now re—
lax in examinations, we can leave the room
for a c al‘ctte, we can go out for a bit of
fresh ai . But unless we straighten out, this
"freedom will be talien'from us, and well it
should be.

' As we would report the lawbroaker to
the police and expect him to be punished
for our protection, so we must make our
honor system into a workable and unbreak-
‘able law, . . .or return to the grade school
system that assumes that we would take
every opportunity to cheat, and must there-
fore he watched at every moment.

A lemg Experience - -

Another graduating class will 'Vvalk to
the rostrum to receive the hard earned di-
ploma and a congratulatory handshake on
Monday. 0n Grinnell’s hundredth anniver-
sary, one class will celebrate it’s fourth,
and will join the great body of alumni of
Grinnell college.

Four years at Grinne‘ll. . . .it has been
a great experience We seniors have learn-
ed a lot, and half of what we learned came,
not from our classes, but. from the exper-
ience of living in the close associations of a
small and friendly college,

We learned that bull sessions can give
to lie ill a short hour the sum of experience
of all therein.

We leamed that Mr, Baumann is an old
softy behind his gargantuan roar.

.We learned that the plain little girl
next to us in history class had a mind to
be respected and admired, and we forgot
about her colorless features. We found that
the quiet guy who ate next to us at the
Dixie knew the world’s great literature in-
side out, and had found therein a fine phil-
osophy for himself.

We learned that the rules at which we
chaffed had a pretty sound reason for ex—
isting, most of them, and that it wasn‘t hard
to leave a dance at 11:45 when everyone
else had to, too.

We discovered that the administration
liked us, and wanted us to like them and
Grinnell. They were far from the old ogres
that we, as freshmen, expected those in
authority to be. We learned that if, as stu-
dents, u'e didn’t snipe and yell at them, and

without even thinking about
the faith or race of the stu~
dent beside us.

To sum it up, we learned to
live with people. We leave
with confidence, because
wherever we go, there will be
pretty much the same kind of

people. Our only hope for
those who come after us is
that they will find here what
we, and those before us find
so valuable.

presented our gripes as constructive criti—‘ H E L L o

cism, that in a pretty fair percentage of
cases, we would be heard, and something
would be done about it.

We learned that a small college is part
of a homogenous and quaking world that
needs all of us to work for its well being.

We discovered how to worship together
