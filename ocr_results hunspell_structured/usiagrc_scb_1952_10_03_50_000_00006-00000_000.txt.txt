WAY

 

BOTH REGULAR & KING-SIZE

BOTH regular and king-size
Chesterfields are premium quality
cigarettes and come in the smart

white pack.

BOTH contain onlythose proven in-
Mnts that make Chesterfields
the best possible smoke: the
world’s best tobaccos, pure, more

costly moistening

agents (to keep

them tasty and fresh), the best
cigarette paper that money can
buy— nothing else.

BOTH are much milder with an ex-
traordinarily good taste and, from
the report of a well-known research
organization — no unpleasant

after-taste.

BOTH are exactly the same in .uII re-
speds. There is absolutely no difference
except that king-size Chesterfield is
larger—contains considerably more of
the same tobaccos—enough more to
give you a 21% longer smoke, yet costs

very little more.
