A look to the future

here is that today’s graduates may
have to light longer and more ruthless
1y, to carve out thElr well-deserved slice
of the success pie.

Now, let us examine various of the
diverse “majors" which are offered at
Grinnell. What exactly are the chances
for ﬁle students in these disciplines to
achieve security and happiness in the
future? But before moving on to this, let
me spend a moment presenting an
“alternative to the future.” This is
known as “never leaving Grinnell." Its
adherents are the so-called “Five-
Year” men and women. It seems that,
on the verge of graduating, they lose
their nerve, and declare themselves un~
[it for the stern demands about to be im-
posed by “the real world.” “I'll just
come back for one more semester.”

at least a ﬂeeting thought to his own prospects

‘ as it once was. When our parents were
graduating from college a generation
ago, the world was a more innocent, in-
viting place to be released into. There
were challenging careers waiting out
there for the young person with
'creativity and a measure of ambition.
Employers were always on the lookout
ror new talent. In 1980, this is no longer
'so. They tell us that everything has
already been done; every original idea
already snapped up and developed to its
-tull extent before we could lift a ten-

:tedly sounds, who is really able to
refute it? You want to go to law school},
med school?, go right ahead. But don‘t

smile of one whose security is assured.

nation’s most prestigious schools will
