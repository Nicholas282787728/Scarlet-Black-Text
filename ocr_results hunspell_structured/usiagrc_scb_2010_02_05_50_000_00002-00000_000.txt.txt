Ice rink construction begins today

BYMA‘ITHEW BACHTELL

As the campus continues its months of salting, shoveling
and derrosting, members of the Grinnell College community
can look forward to using the lOw temperatures to their advan-
tage with 'the installation ofan ice rink. The rink is the product
of a student initiative that was passed last semester, but not
implemented until this month when water can freeze.

”My initiative ms for a completely student run. . .ice rink,"
said Danica Radoshevich ‘12, an avid hockey fan and author of
the initiative. “I thought it'd be a nice way to take advantage of
what’s otherwise pretty unpleasant weather."

The initiative encountered few obstacles. Student Initiat
tive Fund (STIFund) willingly overlooked a single vote short-
fall of the two-thirds majority required for passage, and the
rink itselt'is considerably cheaper than initially expected. In or-
der to build ir, SGA obtained permission from Student Affairs,
Facilities Management, which had to approve the location, and
an insurance office, to offset liability

“It was just a matter of trying to coordinate everything and
meet with people, said Vice President ofSrudemAffairs, Ben
Offenberg 11.

The materials for the rink, including lumber and Tarp,
which will cover an area of two thousand four hundred square
feet, were purchased on Tuesday. The rink will be installed on

the East Campus basketball courts for the remainder of the
winter, after which it will be disassembled so it can be stored
and reused next year.

“It’s not ideal for every student, because 1 can't get skate
rentals .and things like that. It's not the most accessible, in
terms of the rink, but my idea is to start it up.. .and see ifI can
get people to be more interested in hockey and ice skating,"
Radoshevich said. ,

Even though Radoshevich did not budget for skating
equipment in The student initiative, she hopes that future stun
dent groups can organize the funds to make ice skates available
to more students.

Until then, students can turn to The hockey’s thrifty alterna-
tive: broomball. .

Some people want to play broomball, which doesn't re—
quire skates, Radoshevich said.

Many students are looking forward to the new skating rink,
as an opportunity to try something new.

“I mean, I’m from the beach, so I dont know how to ice
skate, but I feel like all these Midwesterners can probably teach
me a thing Or two,"said Erin Labasan'll.

This afternoon, Radoshevich will begin clearing the base
ketball courts, and welcomes any interested students to lend
a hand.
