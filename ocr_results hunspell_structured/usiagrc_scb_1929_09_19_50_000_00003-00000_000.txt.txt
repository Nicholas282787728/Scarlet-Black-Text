tion of these points is also a spur.

The men's and women's glee clubs
which hold a prominent place in com-
pus activities hold tryouts soon after
the beginning of school in which sev-
eral freshmen usually are successful.
The college band and orchestra offer
an opportunity for any who play
musical instruments,

Chances to Debate.

Dramaties st Grinnell holds many
chances for those with histrionic ins
ciinations. In the past year several
freshmen have been given prominent
ports in plays, while the one»act
plays sponsored by the play produc—
tlon classes use much freshman tal—
ent.

In debating Grinnell offers advane
tages which all freshmen are urged
to take each year. The Merrill de-
bate series is open to all freshmen,
and interdorm debates are also care
ried on. The Undergraduate Speak-
ing Exchange is a new venture in
this field giving students a chance to
make comparative studies of institur
tions and is watched wrtb much in-
terest by all colleges and universities.
Contests in speaking for men and
women are held each spring in which
money prizes are given.

Writers May Tryout.

Tryouts are held each fall and at
various'intervals during the year for
editorial and business staffs of the
SCARLET AND BLACK, the Mai-
teaser. and the Tanager, in which a
few freshmen are usually elected.

 

Positions on the Cyclone staff, the
year book sponsored by the junior
class, are open to freshmen by try-
out in the spring. Freshmen may
submit contributions to the Tanager,
the literary magazine of the campus.
and often in past years have had
these contributions accepted and pub—
lished. The Steiner prizes offered in
the spring for various kinds of liter-
ary work are open to freshmen and
have been won by freshmen.

Cosmopolitan, Business and Science
clubs welcome new students who are
interested in these especial fields.
Every freshman is entitled to mem-
bership in the Y. M. c. A. and Y. W.
c. A,, which are influential organiza-
tions on the campus. A freshman
commission of twelve girls is elect-
ed, the president of which is a mem-
ber of the Y. w. c. A. cabinet. All
girls are automatically members of
the Women's Self-government
League to whose governing board a
freshman representative is elected
the second semester.
