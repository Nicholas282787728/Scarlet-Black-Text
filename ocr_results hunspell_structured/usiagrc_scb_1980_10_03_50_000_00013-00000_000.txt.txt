Propaganda: A Parent’s Day fantasy

They came gliding on their insect
wings irom the iarthest reaches ol the
United States, homing in on the small
Midwestern town with urban etriciency.
Coming ot one mind as they did, they
arrived on mass at the airports and bus
stations of Iowa on time. on Friday
night, knowing full well they were not
expected until the lollowtng morning. A
lone larmer, standing amidst the
broken earth of his Iowa castle, \vatchr
ed them surround the town in former
tion, He shook his head wondei-ingiy
and turned back to the land, not hearing
the screams above his John Deere 709,

As was discovered much later, the 00
currence was no chance event, but a
diabolical scheme planned for months
in advancc [with help from the Iran
Rescue Squad Task Forcel. No one
mind could have put together and
supervised such an effort, and indeed,
as Dan Rather later pointed out in his
commentary, the country's finest
minds had participated in what was
called by some to be 'the slaughter of
the guilty'. To understand what happen-
ed, an analysis must be made, not only
of the antagonists, but also of their vic-
tims and the environment in which they
lived.

The town lwhlch shall remain unr
named for reasons of dissolution) was a
small farming community which had
the bad misfortune to harbor a liberal
arts college. The school had somewhat
dubious beginnings rooted in a religion
of questionable merit and further
suspicion was cast by the group of peo-
ple that appeared to run the institution.
The administration had something
known as a president, a male who could
only be characterized by his general
boyishness, He spoke vaguely of ideals
and career services, increasing the

students belief in themselves while
decreasing their actual worth. This
president encouraged the students to
explore their lull potential being',
knowing that ii they did so, they would
move to California and become mellow.

On the president's right hand sat a
person labeled as an Executive Vice-
Presldent of the College, a man not
unlike the annoying buzz of a mercury
lamp, This man concerned himself wiﬂn
privacy, fitness of the body, obedience,
and other such intangibles. The
students did not know quite what he did,
but they lelt his inky presence in all or
their dealings with the administration.
They round him absurd.

The students themselves were, as a

whole, bewildered and hard-edged.‘

Many of them knew what they were;
many nt them thought they knew what
they were; and the remainder took
drugs. Some made attempts at in
dividuallsm and suddenly became part

common a they had not brought their
parents with them to school, Rather, in
his report ol 5229, suggests that the mar
jorlty disliked their parents. While this
may be an exaggeration, it is sale to
say that they viewed Parent's Day with
some apprehension. and the tone of the
campus on that fateful Friday was

they would arrive.

For many years it had been known
that the college produced unsatislac-
tory mdlvlduals — unsatislactory to
parents and the government.

return, and there was general agree
ment that something must bedone. The
government contacted the Maria and,

Carter is the only choice

To the Editor: David Molho has
struck again, Last year this man
displayed a gross misunderstanding oi
international politics by advocating an
invasion of Iran. This year, in his
editorial or September 19, he gives us a
distorted picture of the election year.
He says that the Republican‘presldenr
tial candidate, Ronald Reagan, "has
some good ideas, certainly a good deal
more thandoes Mr Carter ” Whatgood
ideas, Dave, are you reterring to?
Reagan desrres to increase defense
spending dramatically, while cutting
business taxes in order to stimulate the
economy, Reagan also has expressed
his approval of the Kemeruth tax cut.

the next lew years. These three pro»

denounces President Carter [or
creating an inﬂation rate of 18 percent,
yet he endorses a Reagan plan that can
only compound the problem.

Nothing wrong with simple solutions?
How naive can someone be? There
might have been simple solutions to H12
problems or 1793, but this is 1930,
Reagan's economic plan is decidedly
uncomplicated; Just cut taxes,
revitalize industry, and everything will
be fine. You can measure the worth of
this plan by noting that the number ol
economists who have endorsed it can be
counted on one hand.

Although I agree With some at
Molho's criticisms of President Carter,
1 must point out that he ignores that
fact that Mr. Reagan is as politically in-
experienced as Carter was in 1976,

‘Problem. The Mafia set about contac» -

The details of the preparations are
boring, let it suffice to say that on the
Friday of Parent 5 Weekend the
parents were in a state of blood frenzy.
They arrived at the small Midwestern_
town as the sun reddened the sky for the-
iast time They went through a linal
ammunition check and then began their
deadly advance.

The remnants of this story are best
told by the only sﬁrvivor of the attack, a
rat-like creature identifying himself on-

“So, like, we were getting a little ‘
stoned, listening‘to some Dead, and

Molho consistently downplays.
Reagan's weaknesses while exage

Moreover, Molho, as previously men:l
