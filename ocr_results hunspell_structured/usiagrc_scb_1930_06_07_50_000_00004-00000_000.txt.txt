Campus Opinion ‘

Are you in favor oi the proposed
compulsory dance feet

Walter Seem-AI am in favor of it,
because it would increase social ac—
tivities in Grinnell.

Isrrlrcl Sayre—Yes. Dances are
just as much a. part of Grinnell life
as lectures and classical music. How~
ever, 1 do not think it would increase
the number attending the dances.

Elizabeth Lynne—l am very much
in favor of it, because it will make
it possible to have more and better
social functions. Also everyone will
feel that they can go.

John Eisen—No. It will not im-
prove interest in college dances,
Those who appreciate the opportunity
are always willing to pay individual-
ly, and I believe that a compulsory
fee would cheapen the idea of college
dances.

Olive SheldonrNo, I am not in
favor of the plan, It would be un-
fair to those who do not care to at-
tend dances, and a decreased expense
to only a few.

Arline UrbsmAI think it is a good
idea, because it would make for
greater democracy in social life.

Arthur Hough—Yes. It would be
easier to pay at the beginning of the
semester, and more of the fellows
would get dates.

Langan Wins
Track Trophy

Smith Takes Second Place
in intramural Meet;

Clark Third. ‘

Langan hall again came into the
limelight in intramural competition
when it captured the annual inter-
dcrm track meet the third week of
May with forty-fve points. Langan
won the basketball championship last
winter by losing only one game.
Smith hall upset the dope to cop sec-
ond place with twenty—seven and one-
half points, while Clark came In
third with twentyetwo and one»half.

Two new intramural records were
made when Myron Pilhrow of Lan-
gan stepped the mile in 4 minutes 39
540 seconds. The old record, 5:21
2—10, established in 1927, was held by
Phillips of Clark, Building Two's
half-mile-relay team smashed the
old record held by the 1926 Dibble
quartet of 1:38 2-10, when it was
timed in 1:35.

Alexander of Langan was the out-
standing man of the meet. He won
ﬁrst places in the hundred-yard dash,
the 440-yard dash and the broad-
jump, besides running on the record
breaking half-milecrelay. Smith hall
had the hurdle situation well in hand.
securing ﬁrsts in both the high and
low events. Two heats were run in
every event, and intramural rules re-
quired that all buildings should have
a man entered in each section in ord<
er to qualify for places.

To the Editor of The Scarlet and
Black:

In a moment of leisure a week ago
We dropped into Delca Wollen-
Weber's voice recital and enjoyed it
very much.

During the interludes we mused
on many things~on the fact that we
had enjoyed all the student recitals
that we had ever attended, on the
ﬂattery to our tastes of being found
in the same audience with the school
of music faculty and on the sophist-
ication of perferring real music to
canned chords.

Then with a ﬁnal surge of satisfac-
tion at the economy that we were ef-
fecting by our preference,
this resolution which we recommend:

To cultivate our musical apprecia-
tion, to spend a pleasant hour now
and then, to show our scorn of robot
musicians, and from a natural inter-
est in our fellow students, we will at-

tend more student recitals.
Alfred Canard.

Northwestern universiin mil-
lion dollar project for the school of
music of Northwestern university
was launched last night with the am
r nouncement by President Walter Dill
Scott of a gift of $250,000 from the
Presser foundation toward a new
building for the school. The on-
nouncement was made at a dinner
given for Dean Peter c. Lutkin of
the school of music by Mrs. James
A. Patten at her home in Evanston.
The gift is contingent upon the uni-
versity’s raising a like amount, and
an active campaign to raise that
sum and $150,000 additional as en-
dowment will be started today with
Mrs. Patten as chairman of the cam—
paign committee.

College May lie-establish
Geology Course If Desired

Geology, which has suffered a ten-
year abeyance at Grinnell, may again
be offered next year. The students
would go on frequent Saturday ﬁeld
trips. lasting all day in good weath—
er. They would study the glacial and
loess formations, and carboniferous
sandstones and limestones of the
state, and would visit Eldora, Moore,
Le Grand, Red Rock, and other
places. One coal mine would be vis-
ited.

The cost of the trips would total at
least ten dollars. It would give
three credits for the ﬁrst semester.
One year of laboratory science would
be the only prerequisite. students
interested should see Prof. H, s.
Conar—d.
