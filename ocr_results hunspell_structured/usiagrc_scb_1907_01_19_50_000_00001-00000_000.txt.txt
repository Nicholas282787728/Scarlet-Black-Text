THE SEMESTER FEE.

c. E. Fishcr Outlines lhe Plan ior
Re-organizing the Financial System.
The question of a student ice to

cover the expense or the various
college undertakings such as lectures,
musical entertainments and athletic
events is an important One and worthy
or more than passing consideration on
the part of each student. The rid-
vantages oi lllis method are many but
the change to a. system of this lrind
is such a, great departure from the
present system of admission fees that
doubtless there “While some who are
unwrlling :0 support the scheme. Tile
change is on which ell'ects students
rather than faculty and ll'ustees and
as such the movement must be sup»
ported by a lal'ge'iiiaior' v or the
students before oilicial action could
be demanded.

It might be well to mention some
of the orEDmEDLS in favor of the
scheme in Order to set the students to
thinking earnestly in regard to it.

Practically all lectures and musical
and athletic events given under 001'
Eege management are given simply
for the reason that they are demanded
by the students as a Whole. They are
apartof college lite and given be-
cause college students want them.

money making standpoint as many oi

There is scarcely a student to he

of this nature Should be done away
with. \Vlthout them the college

They are given because the students
demand them and since this is so.

WORK OF AN ALUMNIUS.

1]. Heeren's Visit to Grinneli a Busy
and Sueccssiul One.

As an example of what a college
graduate may busy iiimseli at in this
endeavor to accomplish something
during the time immediately after
his graduation the insight into the
bio or one of Grinnell's uluinni which
his recent visit gave is instructive.
Jelli John llcereii, or debating tame.
came back to us with his old time
power unimpaired and with an added
list or arguments gathered from (yan-
[act with hie itself. ,

The object of Ileeren’s visit here
was to assist in building up the Ilible
study work. Asa result much or his
time was spent in conierence with
the committee and Bible study leddr
ers. Intbishe was assisted by Ross
Hadley, State secretary for colleges,
who pointed out some deiects oi the
present' system of teaching while
IIeereu outlined new methods. Some
time was also spent in Iormal con-
Ierences.

Overiso men heard JelliJohn lay
down a series or uuanswerable argllv
ments in favor oi Bible study at the
Y. M. c. A. meeting Thursday night.
more his old time platform ability
stood him in excellent stead. He also
talked at chapel yesterday morning
and pointed out the brightness oi re-
mm which has come into the politi-
cal world in the last row years and
the promise it gives ior the iuturo.
His talk in Dreamers class yester-
day probably gave the most real in-
sightiutc the man himseli lie was
asked to tell some of his many as
periences in social and charitable
work and he drew several lessons mm
the fools winch he gave.

Ills visit as a whole netted many
good results. Severn! men were led to
give systematic Bible study a trial,

SONG RECITAL PLEASES.

Miss Heuer's First Program Draws an
Enrnusiasnc Appreciation From
Her Audience.

An enthusiastic welcome was ac»
corded Miss ileucr when she lirst stepr
ped upon the platiorm last evening.
and it grow more enthusiasticand
cordial aiter each intermission in the
program, Although nor. her lirsc ap»

pearance beioiea Grinnell audience,
the recital or last eveninganorded the

best opportunity yet given of appreci-
ating the Charm 0i Miss Heuer’s sing-
ing and interpretation.

The program was largely composed
or German songs, which seemed to es»
pecially suit the voice and Style of the
singer. The Schubert songs were
beautilully delicate and lyrical, while
the singer’s range of alility was by no
means conﬁned to that type or song,
as was abundantly proved by the
Dvorak number. and the Aria from
“Les Huguenots ”

All together it was a thoroughly enr
icyable program, delightfully given.
There is a. certain charm of interpre-
tation in Miss lIeuer's work which
makes one forget the Voice itself and
think only of the singingiwhich is as
it should be.

ALAPOODATS WIN.

Nellher Farmers NorBloomers Conquer

An early tryout for places in maior

Alapoodat club divided forces and
fought out a bitter contest in indoor
baseball. Although the resulting
score was a tie the Bloomers claim
lhey were handicapped by their attire
and should have the decision, while
the falmel's have an equal claim that
not. all their men knew the rules and
that [he Bloomers were so pretty they
distracted the attention or (lleoppos-
ing side. Tile claims Will be brought
up at the next rugiilar meeting or the
