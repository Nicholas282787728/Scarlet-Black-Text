cations and Radio committee,
KDIC ceased broadcasting ell'er-
tive midnight Monday, April ll
until 7 an“. Tuesday, April l9.

During Collius’ uud Stem
man's rap music show on Satur-
day night, several women called
them to express dissatislactiou
with a song that the women felt
was “otl'eusive and derogatory
towards women." The song,
plriyed by request, was entitled
“l Wnnt Some Pussy."

Shelly Sandel called ﬁrst to
voice her concern. “I don't
want to censor your show," site
said. “I just. as your listen-
ing audience, wanted to tell you
my opinion." Collins responded
that if she did not like the nine

station.

Collins cnmlilmllred that he

was patient with the ﬁrst ﬁve
or six callers. He said that he
tried to explain wlly the song
was played and that it was typi—

Steinmau, threerfourths or the
music that they play hus sexual
overtones directed at women.

As the calls, all of which were

anonymous, continued, Collins

said that he became “frus-
trrtted“ ecause all the callers
were women. “If something
is truly offensive to everyone,

then tllere should have been
calls from everyone. It‘s not
fair to get loud; or abuse about
something that attended only
women," Collins said,

This was the scene last Saturday as students gathered on
Central Campus to protest the dearth 0t women’s«studies
courses at Grinnell. Coordinators Anthippy Petras, Jen-
nifer Macalusn, and Katherine Culberg estimated the
number at demonstrators to be around 100. ”We wanted
this to be a demonstration of our support for women's
studies,“ said Macaluso. President George Drake {pic

women’s studies but expressed reservations about the

possible constraints of

felt that their being punished tor
swearing was justiﬁed. Steins
mall objected, however, to the
severity or his punishment. “If
we‘re being punished tor swear-
ing, that’s what we should have
been punished tor. But. in this
case, we should have just been
written up because that's the
rules on the ﬁrst otrense," Stein.
man said.

According to Stephanie Red-
mall, srtrn chairperson, all
three men had been warned pre-
viouslv, making this their second
ottcuse.

The possib ity ol'juclirial mea—

a discussion as to whether they
violated any laws or guidelines
beyond the rise or profanity Arr
cording to Berger, there are no

be voiced.

Steiunlan disagreed with the
opposition he met when voic—
ing his opinion. “It‘s liberal as
longns you agree with everyone
else‘s opinion, but God help you
it you happen to helieve some
thing else," he said.

over the air, Saying to the audi—
cure, “lt‘s a sad tort or the that
you‘re too inching wenlc to know
what it[rap] is all about," he re
spouded to the complaints,

in Berger’s show, which rol—
lowed Collins and Steinman‘s,
more complaints were phoned in

“You guys can just slick me,"
