A ensemble will be per-
forming tonight in Grin-
iell. The concert will take place in
derrick Chapel at 8:00 pm,

The group, Hesperus, is an en-
emblerinrresidcnce at the
Smithsonian institution‘s National

useum of American History. "lhe
nstrumental group was founded in
979 by Scott Reiss, who performs
long with Tina Chancey and Grant
<1erreid. Singing with the groupwill

Hesperus uses a large variety of
lnique and unusual instruments
‘ome of the more familiar ones are
utes, recorders, and violins. They

illalsouseavielle—anancestorof
. e violin family, a rebecia pear-
haped medieval bowed instrument.
kamenj—aTurkish ﬁddle,alyra—
elated to stringed Greek instru—
nents, and a dombek, which is a
oroccan goblet drum.

Hesperus plays mostly Medi-
val and Renaissance music, They
ocus heavily on Spanish music,
xploring parallels between the Old

World and the New. The music
demonstrates the influence Eastem
migration of Moslems, Jews and
Christians to Spain had on the court
music of the early 13th century.
Dclving even deeper into this study
oftheeffects ofmigration, Hesperus
also examines and performs music
that Spanish explorers brought to
the New World; music that was of-
ten used as a vehicle to convert the
native population.

Thefirstpartottheconcertwill
focus on the medieval songs and
dances of the early Spanish court
music. Duringthesecondpartofthe
concert, Hesperus will perform
mostly 15th-17th century music
composed by either the Spanish or
by New World composers heavily
inﬂuenced by the Spanish explorr
ers‘ music.

Hesperus is the Latin name for
Venus, theevening star. Alsoaterm
for the west wind, Hesperus evokes
images of adventure in exotic lands.
The explorers of the 16th century
explored new and strange lands, just
as the Hesperus ensemble explores
uncharted musical waters with its
Spanish crossover and Early Ameri-

sic is part of what Hesperus is all
about. The group plays at schools
across the country, With unique pro
grams tailored to allow the audience
to learn and have fun at the same
time.

Tina Chanccy, a member ofthe
group, is especially moved by the
inner-city children they perform for,
because the children appreciate the
music so much, havrng often had
little previous musical exposure. Ac-
cording to Chancey, Hespems would
likeitsaudience“tocomeoutknow-
ing more than they did before.”

Thegroup’s basic focus,says
Chancey, “ . . l is to create a
synthesis of early and traditional
music, and to do that in a lot of
different ways. It was alive for
the people of the 1500’s, and it’s
still alive for people today.”
