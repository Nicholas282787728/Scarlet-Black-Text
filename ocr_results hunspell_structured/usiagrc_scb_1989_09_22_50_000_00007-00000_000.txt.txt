Gridders Shut
Out St. Paul

By Steve Clem
and Mick Kulikowski

The Grinnell College football team
uounced St. Paul Bible College last
Saturday, keeping their unbeaten
streak aliver ThePioneers won 35-0,
making it the first time an opposing
team was left scoreless since 1981,
when Grinnell defeated Lake Forest
22-0.

For gridiron fans who enjoy read—
ing the playrby-play, St. Paul Bible
failed to release any statistics'on the
game, so few details are available.
Pioneer coach Greg Wallace, how-
ever, did come up with some infor-
mation.

Wide receiver Marty Hunsucker
and tightend Corey Jones each caught
touchdown passes from quarterback
Dave White The remaining scores
came on the ground. as runningback
Craig Whitaker scored a touchdown
in his first game back from a ham-
string injury and freshman running
back Ted Stanley added two more
touchdowns as well,

Some unofﬁcial statistics werealso
kept by the Pioneer coaching staff.
Grinnell rushed for a whopping 340
yards, with Dave White scrambling
for over [00 of them. Ted Stanley
ran for 73 yards,John Ahman gained
62,and Shannon Gocke, also return»
tng from an injury, rushed for 68
yards. The Pioneers also passed the
pigskin for about 110 yards. Coach

at the volleyball team‘s first home game, against Mt. Mercy.

 

Wallace was glad to see a balanced
attack, on the ground and in the air,
by the offense, “because it will help
you when you play better teams.“

On defense, the Pioneers were
outstanding, holding up to their
"bend, but don’t break" style. Unof-
ficially, Grinnell held St. Paul Bible
to a mere 3 yards rushing and 139
passing.

"The defense shut down the run,
which forced them to pass, but only
on our terms," coach Wallace said.

Linebacker Chris Wolf gram inter-
cepted two passes, and Scott Goings
put enough of a hit on an opposing
player to earn himself the team‘s
“Mister” award for registering the
best tackle in the game.

Coach Wallace said he was
“pleased with the shutout. That‘s a
big accomplishment for a defense.”

The lopsided victory for Grinnell
allowed Wallace and his assistants
to play everyone on the Szrmember
squad, giving them both confidence
and experience for the remainder of
the season. “It gave us a chance to
work on partsofour game. Iwish we
could have a game like this every
year,” Wallace said. >

The Pioneers will certainly need

game tomorrow afterrtoon. Grinnell
will be on the road again, visiting
Iowa Wesleyan The opponenm will

head coach, who brought with him a
pack of tremendously fast recmits
from Texas.

As Grinnell remains unbeaten
going into tomorrow’s game, Coach
Wallace said that the team “must
keep their heads on straight."

Purple Roos Run All America at Luther

who worked particularly hard in this
race and all practices were Brett
Kelver, Pete Insel and Greg Adams.

With the intensity of the race
showing on their faces, the men‘s
varsity cross country team packed
for nearly three miles during the All
America Meet at Luther last Satur-
day. The lield included 18 teams,
five of which are in the national top
20. Results were Wisconsin-La-
Crosse, 1st; St. Thomas, 2nd; AuV
gustana, 3rd; Luther, 4th; St. Olaf,
6th; Loras, 7th; and Carleton, 8th,
with the Roos taking a very respect-
able 5th place.

According to assistant coach
Andrew Hamilton, “The guys ran
swell, real swell.“ Evidence of how
well the Roos placed is seen in the
fact that Grinnell beatLoras, a team
which had nipped them by a mere2
points the week before,

The squad was again led by Jon-
athan Lave. 17th, who said he pur-
posely held back to help his team-
mates packr He was followed by
Todd Rowekamp, 27th; MarkCouch,
46th; Mikelennings, 55th, who had
a particularly strong race; Jason
Maples, 58th; co-captain Nick
Hopley, 60th; and Jefolmer, 7lst.

As there was room only for the top
seven runners from each team in the
varsity race, the other Roos raced as

mile course -— two miles of ﬂats,

overall. Byron Johnson was close
behind at 27th, after whom came
Eric Fuld, Joe Wilkinson. Gerald
Honigstock, Ali Akgun and Eben
Erhard, another captain. (The other
captains are Pat Heller, who is fast

A noisy and encouraging crowd
led the Grinnell women’s volleyball
team to victory in its ﬁrst homegamc
of the ’89 season, beating Mt, Mercy
College in ftve games. The Pioneers
were forced to go the limit but were
able to defeat Mt. Mercy with aggrcr
sive play, and supportive fans

The battle began with Grinnell
capitalizing on its definite height
advantage (the tallest Mt. Mercy
player stood 5'10") by effectively
blocking htts and attacking the ball
offensively.Excellentballplacement
earned the learn several key points as
the players remained alert to holes in
the their opponent's defense.

The first game cndedr'n a score of
16-14 concluding the choking pat-
tern which developed when botlt
teams missed several serves.

In the next two games, the team

seemed to lose some of its earlier
intensity and could not generate any
real offensewhich rcsultedin succes-
sivelossesof lO-lSand 12-15. Darby
began rocking in game four as the
team rallied behind the fans‘ cheerv
ing and used accurate passing and
good movement to achieve a 15-13
come from behind win.
' The fifth game of the twohoure
long match showed the steady imr
provemcnt of the team as a sense of
patience replaced the anxiousness
apparentin theearliergames.Behind
the powerful blocking duo of fresh-
men Beth Prullage and Kathy Kritz,
the Pioneers new defense worked
well with each player ﬁnding her
position and bringing about a 15-13
final match victory.

Hustle, court awareness, and con-
centration were the key factors in the
win over Ml, Mercy. Several rota
lions allowed many players to see
playing ttmc and effectively threw
offMt.Mercy‘sintensity and timing.

Coach Cain said shcfclt Lhatthcteam
played well but said that they were
nowhere near their potcnua].

“Our serving is still a problem and
continues to prevent us from capitalr
i.'/.ing on the volleys that we win. The
thing that kcpt us in the match was
balanced, consistent play, especially
matofSusan Egbertand Kathy Krttz.
The crowd was also a big factor be»
cause it was very exciting for the
women to play at home and hear
people cheering them on,”said coach
Sheila Cain.

Following the varsity games, the
J.V.teamtookto thecounandshowed
true enthusiasm after waiting nearly
three hours to play. Several players
received playing experience but the
team was unable to come away with
avictory. Although the team failed to
score in game one and tallied only
four points in game two, the team
made a comeback in the third game
behind the serve of freshman May
Chao, only to lose 12-15.

This was thesecond victory forthc
Grinnell women’s varsity team as
they beat Rockford College last Sat-
urday at the Beloit Invitational. Sim»
iliar to their first home victory, the
Pioneers battledtotheftnish and took
the last game 17-15 on an ace serve
by sophomore setter Amy Robinson.
This was the team‘s only victory of
the toumarnent,asthey suffered losses
to Beloit College 6-15, 2-15 and
Ripon College 8715, 4»1S.

Coach Cain attributed the losses to
the tearn‘spoorttansition game,“The
defensive coverage was better, but
we gotsucked up and were notable to
execute good hits," she said.

Saturday, Sept. 23, at 2 pm, Lu-
ther comes to DarbyGymnasiurn. On
Sept 26, at 6 pm” Coe and
Grandvicw Colleges will also meet
the Pioneers in what promise to be
