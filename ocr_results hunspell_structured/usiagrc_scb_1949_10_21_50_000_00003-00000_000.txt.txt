is a part. According to wsn
headquarters, the Grinncll nlonr
ey is being allocated for use in
student cente which provide
recreational tac ties for foreign
students. More specifically, Grin—
nell money has helped in the
establishment oi a social center
for DP students at the >Unlversl-
ty of Innsbruck, in Austria. The
Geneva ottiee sends along this
description of the social center
at lnnsbruclr:

“It you stood in front or thel
University of Innsbruck. your at
tcntion would eventually be
drawn to two wooden buildings
of quite a pleasant character
standing at the fringe oi the
University grounds. You ape
proach them more closely and
discover the student center tor
DP students established by
World Student Relief.

“One building is given over to
a canteen and here 250 DP stu—
dents receive a daily hot meal
providing over 1200 calories. The
meals are simple but . tractive
and nutritious, and special allowe
ance is made for the purchase of
fresh fruit and vegetables.

“The second building is the
social and educational center
where DP students can come for
study'and relaxation. As the
students live in campus wrth
good amenities and iacilities, the
services uttered by World Stu-
dent Relief are greatly appree
ciated. In the ‘small but friendly
club room, students can meet for
discussion, lectures, radio list~
ening, or just pass an hour or so
in quiet relaxation. in the next
room, there is a small library—
tbe open sesame into a world

 

where knowledge has been Shq!

to foreign students for

“While the ultimate scltlcmontl
of these young people is beingl

sought in many directions, they
have an opportunity in this cons

ter to fill the long hours all

trailing in useiul study and prep.
aration lor whatever the luture
may bring, The wsn ecntcr
brings them once more into con-

tact with the wider world andl

broader vision,"

This year the Board of Religion
has scheduled the Grinnell W. S.
S, F. drive to take place during
the month ot November, instead
of March as last year.
