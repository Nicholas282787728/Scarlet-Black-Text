Columnist breaks Grinnell' 5 fashion standards The Sneﬂge

Dressed up, cont. from p. 8

Students reject high fashion as anti- -Intellectual and
snobby And they do notwnnt to seem rich

This docs not mean that Grinnellians do not like
dressing up. Last week I had coffee with Elena i’esner
'06, who told me that she Iised to dress nicely when
she came to Grinnell, but after her first year she gave
up and started wearing the uniform of her peers
My friend Mary who graduated last year were the
Grinnellian uniform when at school, but had an en-
tirely different wardrobe (and make—up) for when she
returned to Chicago. This ability/dcslrc to dress up is
further evidenced by the outﬁts at Waltz.

At Grinnell there are no regulations on student
dress according to the student handbook so students
can wear whatever they wantﬁxcept they cannot go
to class stark naked because it breaks federal law. But
this freedom of dress is not fully explored, and some
types of dress are discouraged. For orample, those who
dress too preppy and wesr makeup ire sometimes
ridiculed by their peers. For my part, people have been
extremely complimentary about my dress, even if some
find it n bit ridiculous.

Those people who like the wnyl dress have voiced
to me their unhappiness with the statc of fashion at

Grinnell. A few days ago when I told Susan Vcscovi 06
rhar I was writing my column for this week on fishion
at Grinnell, she crplodcd, crying ‘What?! There is no
fashion at Grinnell!"

vescovi's critique finds an echo in a Chronicle of
Higher Education article, published last year, in which
Aisha Liibi, lamenting snidents' incredible lack of
fashion, wrote “Students fashion sense usually means
nothing more noteworthy than low risejeans or insig-
nia sweatshirts." Perhaps Labi and Vcscovi are on to
something.

Hive Grinnellians lost sight of the playfulness,
youthfulness and inventiveness of fashion by adopting
a bland, comfortable uniform?

For the rest of a student’s life she will most likely
have to wear one uniform or another because mostjobs
require one. But as a college student at Grinnell we can
dress as we like. What an opportunity to throw off the
uniform and have fun!

I am not saying that all students should dress for
mally or funkily everyday, but perhaps they can coir
sider the Implications of weuing Grinnells sportswear
uniform, and instead adopt a more personal style.

This paragraph doesn't do anything for the picck
I believe an aesthetic appreciation ofclorhes and styles

should not be frowned upon. It should be cclcbratcd
A tun style is appreciated at Grinnell bringing color
to the campus

There are already some students on campus who
enjoy dressing in their own style. I spotted sarah Mirk
'08 on the Forum catwalk on Tuesday; she was wearing
a forest green band shirt cut into a scoop neck with a
black lacey tank top underneath, a ﬂouncy mIIlti-lay-
cred purple skirt and a maroon jacket. l—lcr fashion is
young, personal and idiosyncratic. It brings color and
joy to the campus

Before closingl have a few fashion tips. One: no
matter what you are wearing keep a clean appearance.
Two: if you find yourself going to clrIss in pajamas
with your eyes halfsopen because you don't have time
to change, then sleep in the nude. That way, you will
be forced to put on clothes. Three: ifyou find yourself
falling asleep in class, wear a tie. It is uncomfortable
for a reason.

so, “why are you dressed up?" Honestly,I learned
to dress up from my grandfather, Professor suheil
Bushiui,who has been my greatest inspiration. I have
taken his love for clothes and developed It into my
own personal style, never forgetting the joy of fashr
ion,

Bearing the wait of Senegal

ln Senegal, I spend a good part of
my time waiting. Sometimes it's Sitting
in the car rnpide, a colorful, rickety mini-
bus thnt's a common method of public
transportation, waiting for a critical mass
of people to squish in before the attenr
dant trips the roof with a coin to signal to
the driver that it's time to go.

Sometimes it’s at school or at my int
ternship, waiting for the start of a meet—
ing, because things invariably do not
begin until at least a lialfrhour after their
scheduled start time, ifnot longer. Iwait
for appointments, for transportation, for
food, and the rest of Senegal wiits too.

The waiting is pardy due to the pOVr
erty of the country, which means a lot of
public services lack the resources to run
efﬁciently Another part of it is that the
Senegalese notion of time is more ,3,
laxed than the Western one, and social
relationships are valued over punctual—

From a Senegalese point of view,
it’s better to be late to work after have
ing spent time greeting your neighbors,
going through the ritual inquiries about
their health and their family, than to be
at work on time at the expense of those
interactions.

Qiitc frequently, all this waiting
frustrates me tremendously It can be
maddening to sit for an hour and a half
waiting for an event to start or for my
food to be cooked.

I don’t know what to do with my
mind,and it’s notIIsIIally possible to zone
out entirely, because being oblivious to
your surroundings makcs you even more
likely to get lost, pickpocketed, harassed

or hit by a rogue motorbike 1:th is the

though, I can appreciate the beauty in
the waiting,

Early in my stay, I went to a tradr
tional Senegalese wedding celebration
that was entirely based on waiting: a
courtyard full of women in colorful 0UP
fits and headscarves spent the afternoon
sitting in plastic lawn chairs, waiting
while the men performed the religious
marriage ceremony at the mosque.

then from lunch until dusk, then from
dusk until the dancing started, and one
by one even the most reserved-seeming
women sprang up to be egged on in a
few seconds of the handswuving, foots
stomping, hiprshiking Senegalese dance
that looks like joy incarnate.

I’ve grown to love the time I spend
in the Cill‘ rapide waiting for people to
file In, looking out the window—which
is never covered by glass and lets a wel-
come brcczc into the hot minibusi
watching the colorful parade ofa busy
Dakar street, marveling at the giace of
the women who somehow manage to
perfectly balance the babies strapped
to their backs and the huge bundles on
their heads.

Every so often, something inside of
me clicks into the slower place, and I’m
grateful to feel like there is enough time
to live without rushing. I wish I could
capture this feeling more often, espe—
cially since I know that in a few months
I’ll be back in Grinnell, when: having
nothing to do for an hour would be a

it doesn't seem fair that i‘vc jumped
from being too rushed to being too
leisurely, and that I can’t store up all
this downtime to use during the next
Grinnell hell week. On the other hand,
I’m grateful to be forced, ifonly by sheer
boredom, to take another look around,
and another, and try to truly digest ev—
erything I'm seeing. No matter how
many hours 1 log on cars rapides during
my four months here, 1 will only see or
understand a tiny fraction of the con—
trasts and contradictions of Senegal.

RE: “Back off, 5&3”

I speak from personal crporience when 1 .tssutc the
8&7} stud", and indeed all Gtinnclliaris, that the status
of cats In Indonesia is most satisfactmy. Indeed, with
the amounts of garbage overflowing from every hatch
and the subsuqently Buit , .e hits that enjoy these
trash can corncsnbles, the cats ofludoncsio are quite
well off

If there is to be any concern, it should be EOVWIIdS
the dogs of Indonesia. Islam tends to take an unfavorr
able view on Man's Best Friend, the result being many
stray dogs wandering the streets. Indeed, it wouldn‘t be
a muggy Jakarta day without a pooped pooch sleeping
on some steps with the requisite three flies buzzing
around its head.

Therefore, to raise awareness on their plight, I will
dress up snugly in the middle of januaiy and sleep in
until my noon class until the howls of -.i hundred hunt
gry hounds is heard by all.

Rain forest in Grinnell?

Rain forest in Grinnell? I'm not sure this is what
Grinnell should be famous for. Apparently Grinnell
is one offour towns in Iowa that are finalists being
considered for an cnoimous indoor min forest that
would be subsidizcd by the federal government (De:
Il/lm'nru Righter, March 30) Ini all for iain feicsts
In the Paciﬁc Northwest. In Biazil. In Africa But
do we need to pave 40 acres of top farmland to build
a rain forest' in Grinnell Iowa—if the community
can cough up the requisite 525 million to trigger the
project? Maybe I’m missing something.
