Alcohol use advisors selected
from counselor training cente

by Mark Vcorhces

Selected by the College to serve
as advisers on campus alcohol use
next September, Jim Krart and
Lisann Woli are now attending a
len~month specialized, intensive
training program in Oakdale.
Iowa Susan Crim, assistant dean
of Student Affairs. explained that
their presence on campus will not
serve as a "new counselor
program” but as a response to a
socially accepted {acct of life.

Lasl year, recognizing a trend
back lowards drinking and an
increasing number oi people
discussing drinking problems with
advisers, Student Atiaii-s saw a
problcm with drinking which
couldn't be defined, Crim said,
Students investigated the
possibility of outside people
coming to Grinnell last spring, but
their plans never materialized
This year. the Alcohol and Drug
Use Subcommittee, comprised of
students and members of Student
Affairs, has been formed. The
Committee invited Kraft and Wolf
to Grinnell.

The counselors are not coming to
solve alcohol problems, but rather
to provide educational iniormation
about alcohol to the campus, Crim
stressed. Noting that information

about alcohol and its effects is not
uvailableon campus,Crlm saidlhe
counselors will initially work with
the resident and student advisers
to inform them about alcohol. After
thatt Crim said, what they will do
will depend on how they teel aiter
being on campus and also on what
students want If the subcommittee
reels their presence is valuable and
the counselors wish to remain.
Wolf and Kraft could possibly
continue after September.

Kraft stated lhat he and Wolf
would he at Grinnell only to give a
program ii “kick H Krait seemed
particularly mterestcd in the
educational and counseling aspects
oi some kind of program, He said
that he and Wolf will act as
resource people, Any program that
they get Started. he explained, will
be run by Grinnell people. it is not
possible to take a program and
slap it on a community, Krait
commented. There arc limitations
in what you can do in a month. he
said.

The Oakdale Training Center.
currently attended by Wolf and
Kraft. is a division of the
University of Iowa’s Alcoholic
Center on the Oakdale Campus.
The program attracts about 25

if

people a year irom all over the
country who wish to be drug and
alcohol counselors, The first tw or
three months of the prograné
spent in classrooms and at the
Center Following this initial
period, the participants work with
patients at the hospital in Oak
The last phase or the prograi is
internships at places all overlo a.
Grinnell will be Wolf’s and Kraft’s
third internship. Consequently,
they will be close to graduating and
experienced at their jobs, Susan
Hood. director of the program,
sees their prcsence at Grinnell as
positive. She feels they will be
able to consult and help initiate
some programs on campus .

Kratt and Woli were descri ed
by Crim as committed, interested,
young and ready to visit Grinnell
in September. One student
member oi the subcommitte id
she was “at ease with them ” rim
emphasized that the two advisers
were not nonrdrinkers They would
be spending nights at the Pub and
attending the social iunctic.
campus. Hopclully. students with a
drinking problem. who do not feel
like going to the Mental Health
Center. will be able to relate to
either Wolf ur Kraft.

The positions oi treasurer, auditor,

Frankel, Joyce Shinaberry, Matt

The auditor is required to have a
