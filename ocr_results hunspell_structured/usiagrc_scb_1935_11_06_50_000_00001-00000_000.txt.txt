Three Players Injured
in Drake Battle

By Jim Bradley

The Iowa state Teachers all—
veteran eleven of Cedar Falls, an-
other ancient rival of Grinnell,
will come here Saturday to en-
gage in the 12th gridiron strug-
gle waged between the two Iowa
schools since 1899.

For the first timc this year the
Pioneers will face a team on equal
weight basis, both clubs averaging
only 111 pounds. The Panther line
will outweigh the Pioneer forward
wall by 12 pounds, but the Crinnell
backs will have the same advanr
tage over the fast and shifty Tue
tor ball carriers, whose average
will be only 153 pounds.

Pioneers Usually Outwelghed

All Grinnell opponents this sea-
son have outweighed the Pioneers
from 18 to 23 pounds. But in spite
of this weight handicap, Crlnnell
has managed to either outscore
her rivals or, with the exception of
the Michigan State tilt. hold
them to a very slight margin, be-
ing nosed out by Creighton 7-6,
and losing to Drake in a stirring
offensive struggle 33-21.

However, Coach Watt, Gr'lnnell
mentor, anticipates a bitter battle
due to veteran material of the Tu»
tors, the number of letterrnen be-
ing 15. Thus far this season the
Panthers have downed a strong
Michigan Western state Normal
team 20-6, and last week whipped
Simpson college 3377. Earlier in
