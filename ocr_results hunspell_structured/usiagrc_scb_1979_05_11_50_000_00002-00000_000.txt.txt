A wild'start for Kramer

by Aline Rawland

Joint Board, during its first
meeting with the 1979-1580 hall
presidents on Wednesday, suiiered
a major set-back when a group of
masked students kidnapped the
new SGA president, David
Kramer,

Wielding squirt guns. three
students carried Kramer off, while
one remained to shout ransom
demands to the astounded crowd.
Vicespresident George Turnbull,
who mysteriously also had a squirt
gun with him at the meeting,
returned their fire and then took
Over as chair of the session.

Several hall presidents ads
vacated paying a ranson fee for the

lost leader, but Turnbull informed
them, “We don’t have any money
until next year, the only power you
have tonight is to appoint people to
the various positions they applied
for.”

Later, Kramer returned, minus
his shirt. After the meeting, he told
this reporter that the kidnappers
were “four of my bat friends,"
who made no threats on his life or
attempted any bodily harm.
Several people present named
Bob Greenberg as one oi the
conspirators.

’ Kramer's troubles continued as
he tried to run a swiit. orderly
meeting. His efforts were thwarted

by Pete Blonsky, Younker hall
president. and Paul Volker,
Initiative Fund chairman, who
carried on the traditions set by
retired member, Cornell Rudov.

These two “old hands“ plagued
Kramer, obviously a little green at
parliamentary procedure, with
questions of process, as well as
drawn out questioning oi applir
cants tor committee positions. At
the end of the meeting, which
dragged on for an hourandrarhalf,
Blonsky requested an unpreced
ented rollrcall vote on the motion to
adjourn. He voted ‘nay: after all
the other members, in turn, voiced

Letters to the editor

Concern over lab safety

To the editor: A recent incident in
my organic chemistry lab has
prompted some true reﬂection on
the value of these labs in their
Current state. It seems that the
health and safety aspects are over-
looked or ignored in the rush to
finish the labs. and relatively few
efforts are made to protect
students from contact with
dangerous materials or potential
hazards.

Just last week, I saw several
pieces of glassware blowrup less
than three feet from my face. The
heater I happened to be using (the
only one like it left in the lab) was
an older model that had an
asbestos lining in the bottom

DURING "EATING, moisture
drips on the asbestos, creating the
potential for an explosion. Despite
several reported incidents oi this
kind in years past, this one heater
remained in the lab. The failure to
remove it was a gross oversight,
equal to forgetting where you
planted a land-mine on Mac Field,
knowing someday someone would
find It.

Thanks to my efforts, there are
no more oi these potentially
hazardous heaters left in lab.
Fortunately, the only damage from
the explosion was to lab equipment
and my nerves.

MY MAJOR COMPLAINT, how-
ever, has to do with the handling of
potentially hazardous substances
in lab, Compared to our health-
obsessed Society of the 70's,
organic labs seem to [all some
where in the Dark Ages,

Though an infinite number of
restrictions have been placed on
consumer products and
manufacturing processes which
are dangrous, we continue to use
benzene (nearly the most car-
cinogenic substance known todayt
in lab,

is THE VALUE of students to
society so low that children can’t
play in ﬂammable pajamas, and
yet we can play with benzene?

The use of this and other coma
pounds could become less poten-
tially harmiul ii the students were
warned of their hazardous effects,

Even with a warning. the danger
inherent in the chemicals would
not vanish.

I think the chemistry depart
ment should step back and weigh
the true value of these labs against
their potential hazards. The
hazards oi many seem to outweigh
the benefits in terms of knowledge
gained and technique learned.
Parts of these labs could easily be
sacrificed without any great loss to

Decries lack of student

To the editor: A wise man once
said that only people die, not ideas.
So it seems that some of the worst
are perpetuated, such as the recent
Phoenix act of the F»grade
proposal, in spite oi what seems to
be undefeatable odds, I would like
to suggest a iew reasons why the
faculty should reconsider its ac-
tions on Monday.

The Grinnell catalog proudly
blares forth the claim that students
have signiiicant impact on college
policy The Monday iaculty
meeting showed how hollow those
words are. I find it more sad than
deplorable that certain members
oi the iaculty take it upon them-
selves to insure as little student
input as possible on such a crucial
policy issue as the grading system,

Let’s not kid ourselves,
proposing a major policy change
this near finals is not putting the
policy iorward ior general dis-
cussion and consideration. It is a
blatant opportunistic attempt to
ram a policy through without

higher education.

ALTHOUGH THE college is
responsible ior my health only
while i am here, shouldn't my
tuture health also be considered in
terms oi the potential danger that
is being done to it now?

i do not mean to place any blame
by this letter, only to point out the
wrong so that the situation can be
corrected.

P,S —Thanks to my lab assistant
who is lorever reminding me to
wear my saiety glasses. Charles

Some contend that«Grinnell
graduates; are. rdiscriminated
against in the tough grad school
entry competition lwould say it is ,
the burden oi those proposing the
change to show, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that this is the
case. This sort ofiiproof seems
curiously missing and un-
convincing in the iaculty

argument.

Some contend that a Grinnell
“A" has become meaningless
without the measure of failure
provided by the “F" Yet what
makes Grinnell theicollege it is?
The fact that matters an alter-
native to the same old concepts ol
higher education!

“A difference” is what makes
students travel thousands oi miles
to study in a cornfield. rather than
the stuffy halls of academia close
to home,

i urge the iaculty to reconsider
its ill-timed action, and vote down
a regression in education. a.
