that for $6.00 a year every student of
the institution would be admitted to

cost each man in single admission f 5
$14 S5 01' more. and each Woman 812.3».

to nny event under the proposed
scheme would be transferable and that
enough rniglit bereahzed during one
course or the year by the sale on tickets

To students who have Worked their
way into evelits, it can be said that
the some work must necessarily he
done but that they would receive cash
instead OI admission tickets in pay-
ment.

To the men of the institution who
liear that the proposed system would
result in lower oppOrtunities to Show
I‘M’OIS to their Iliily friends the «rues
tion might be asked if they would Still
insist on paying loi’ the }‘ ilegre of
