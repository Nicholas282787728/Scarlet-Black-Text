arrival of the boy-child Men»
doza prevented his attendance at
the program. Corky Brown,
Loose hall senior, was in charge
of the intramural.

Unusual costumes and attrac-

to fame. Highlighting the danc—
ing was Beth Weiss' leadership

Dancer Page Says,
Eaiing S’rill Okaygf
No Sleep Worries

Ballet dancers Page and Stone
will appear in the second of the
Grinnell concert series Tuesday
night at 3 o’clock in the high
school. Miss Page has appeared
as a prima dancing star of the
Chicago Opera,

Contrary to the impression
c- ated in Red Shoes, Miss Page,
in discussing her training sched-
ule, says it’s still all right to
indulge in “plenty of beeisteak,
cream, and anything you want
to eat.” Moreover, she says that
much sleep, while important, is
not a necessity.

She said that the future home
of the ballet may be in the
United States because of the
figure beauty and adiletic ten»
dencies of American girls, but
she mentions a glutting of the
market. “There are plenty of
good dancers, too many of them,
but there is a scarcity of danc-
ers with ideas."

“I hope and pray that the
sons of the present generation
do not think they are being
governed perfectly," Norwegian
parliament head Carl J. Hame
bro said Thursday in his cone
vocation address on UN prob-
lems and politics He later stated
that the dissatisfaction of young
lpeople With government today
is the hope for luttlre world
peace.

Some of the UN’s current
problems, according to Hambro,
are European and Asia’s refugee
situation and disagreements ris—
ing from a ”lack of harmony
between the preamble of the
UN charter and the charter‘s
second article." A third prob-
lem is that “UN delegates do
not speak the same language."

word may mean a complete.

y different thing in Russia than
it does in the . s., Hambro ex-
plained.

About Russia and her isola-r
tion Hambro said, “There are
no experts on Russia—only
varying degrees of ignorance.
We do not know what is hap—‘
pening behind the Iron Cur-
tain."

Speaking of UN work in gen»
eral, the statesman said, “More
has been accomplished than
most people realize, but we are
still moving forward slowly."

”When you criticize the UN,
you must consider one funda-
mental thing," he later stated.
“No convoy can go faster than
its slowest ship. We have to
follow the same policy in dip—
lomatic life. That's why it’s so
important to give assistance to
underdeveloped countries."

Hambro, former Norwegian
delegate to the UN, was intro—
duced by President Samuel
Stevens, An invocation by Dr,
Winston L. King and the choir's
“And the Glory of the Lord"
from The Messiah preceded the
address.
