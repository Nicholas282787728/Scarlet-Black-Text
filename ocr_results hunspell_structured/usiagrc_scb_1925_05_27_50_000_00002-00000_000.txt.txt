marked: “Well, Read you may as well
take rt us you lind it." ththcr to my
credit or not, I rcplicd; "I don‘t lime
to take it." That, lrr-icily, is the pur-
pose at this student opinion, to speak
for certain individuuls whom 1 know
leel parallel with me in tllis connec—
tion. Lot rt be known to thosc who
may read this statement thct, "We
don't have to tclro it!" And lurthcr»

anything that so frankly dl‘dgs so
