As foreign students in China. we
have Saturday and Sunday free,
even though the Chinese work or
have classes on Saturdays. Most of
the CIEE students use the
weekends {or travel. so the
weekend of October 31 many of us
made plans to go places. Most or
our trips had been to cities around
Nanjing, so this weekend we
wanted to see how the other so per
cent oi the population lives — as
peasants in the countryside,

Saturday morning, we tied
blankets and a tent to our
Shanghairrnade bikes. which we
weren't sure would make it
through the trip, as they were slar~
ting to fall apart after two months
of use After riding to the outskirts
or the city. we waved down a truck
driver who put our bikes on the
hack of his truck and drove us in 20
minutes a distance that would have
taken us four hours to do on bikes.
to Tang Shan, or “hot water mouiv
tai "

After eating Jiaozi tchinese
dumplingsi and taking pictures oi
the woman making them. we head-
ed away irom the town on the dirt
roads and paths going out to the
fields to look for an unused patch of
grass on which to pitch our tent
This promised to be a difficult task
because while in American coun»
tryside means vast, lovely. open
spaces, the countryside in China
reiers to land where there is nardly
space to walk between the maze oi
crops. much less put up a 6-byrG
tent. Marka thought she iound the
ideal place —— away lrom the
village. tour whole square yards ot
grass, only slightly sloping — until
Theo told her that all the little
mounds behind here were
gravesites. Not wanting to offend
local ancestors, we continued down
our dirt path

Two hours later. we found
another smaller patch of grass (at
tually the slope up to a bridge).
Our camping spot was closer than
we would have liked to a tairly big
village. On earlier trips we‘d round
that staying too close to a village
meant bigger crowds and more at-
tention than we could handle. Our
worries were confirmed imr
mediately after getting oil our
bikes as we were surrounded by
swarms of children on their way
home from school. all laughing and
daring each other to go closer to
the foreigners, They all iorgot to be
afraid when Kathy took out
postcards and pictures at her city
and her family. Kathy had the idea
that they could all share one
postcard. but beiore she knew it.
she'd given away all her postcards
and had a hard time hanging onto
her pictures of her iamily and dog.

Meanwhile Theo set up the tent
but as soon as it was up. the kids
ran over. full of bewilderment
about this strange bright green
dome that might as well have been
irom outer space To top their sur-
prise. Theo explained that was
where we were going to sleep. All
the people from the village. who

had by now gathered with the '

children. were very worried about
us and kept asking what we would
do when it got cold that night and
started raining. they didn't
understand that the (CM would
keep the ralnout. Then we took out

Walkman » and as we expected
from previous experiences, the
kids stampeded each other trying
to get a chance to listen.

After our show had ended. We
went to look for something edible
in the town. which we didn‘t find.
We did meet an old peasant woman
who asked us to come to her house
for dinner. We only had time to sit
in her house — a bare cement room
with straw on the door. people
from the Village wandering in
groups through her open door to
observe us drinking the plain hot
water she served us — before an
unusually healthy and conﬁdent-
looking man insisted on showing us
to his house. From his command of
the situation. we sensed he was so-
meone important and that he was
carrying out the responsibility he
ielt to provide the best welcome
the village could offer the ioreign
guests Our feeling was confirmed
when we were shown into his
house.

His iiouse had painted walls. a
TV and stereo. and several comforr
table arlnchairs. into which We
were ushered. The crowd of
peasants dissipated as most at the
villagers. except tor the old woman
whom we kept close by use. were
shnoed out of the house. Soon after
we were served sugar water. one at
the men informed us that dinner
was being prepared tor us at
another place, so we moved tor the
third time On the way to our
newest destination. we passed the
old woman's homo and the men
tried to make her go home. But we
felt loyalty and altection for our
triend and held her iiand tightly to
keep them lrom sending her home,

We were surprised to arrive at a
fenced~ln. twostory building which
seemed to be tand We found out

quarters of the village. We were
shown into the kind of room that
looked like one would expect to be
used tor receiving and entertaining
cadres. We Sal down in some more
comiortable armchairs along with
seven or eighl olficial~looking men.
First we were introduced to the
village's head person. a well
nourished. aloolrlooking man
whose appearance. contrasted
sharply with the lean people we
were used to seeing in the lields.
We knew we were observing “remr

water or sugar water.

We should have expected their
next show of hospitality — an offer
to arrange [or our dinner and ac»

on our faces, we graciously declin»
ed their offer ofa hotel room (realr

happily agreed to eat dinner with
them. as it would have been too inl»
polite to reiuse completely their
hospitality, besides, we were

we thought we were just taking
part in ritual Chinese politeness
where a host otters his hospitality

something was wrong. however

they were not accepting it. wetrled

Their meaning became clearer

in our tent, From this we gathered
that the government held them
responsible for our saiety. We
made it clear to them that if the
government would not permit us to
sleep outside. we would return that
night to Nanjing University
because we hadn't come out to the
countryside to sleep in a hotel.
Finally, we heard the car return
and our hosts disappeared for a
quick meeting and returned with
happy faces to say dinner was
served.

So with our cadre triends We
emptied glass atter glass of
Chinese wine at their insistence t0
"gan bei" (bottoms up) and ate a
meal fit for a wealthy landlord
without our hosts ever mentioning
again either the government. a
hotel room. or our satety. even
when we announced after dinner
that we were tired and planned to
head back to our tent

We should have suspected
something when one of the impor-
tant men looked at Theo‘s Chinese
identification with more than a lit
tle interest and then proceeded to
write down every number and
other item ol information on the

We went through the customary
procedure ot showing that our tent
wouldn't leak and our sleeping
bags would keep us warm and then
happily waved goodbye. We
thought to ourselves that we would

appreciated their hospitality. since
we thought everything had worked
out so Well.

We settled down eomtortably in
to our sleeping bags thinking that
the most that would bother us was
the sound of a little wind or rain
Two hours later. we were abruptly
awakened by the headlights of a
truck shining directly on our tent
and the sound at anxious voices
calling Theo's Chinese name tYou
wouldn’t believe how nasty “Ai De

angry Chinese man in the middle
of the night.) But that was not
enough. Because we didn‘t res-

So we went to sleep again, just to
be awakened again by the same
car noises and headlights, but this
time the voices seemed more em-

through the same spiel again when
the tent flaps opened and someone
grabbed Theo's leg to wake him.
Theo mechanically sat up and
started to close the tent flaps but to
our surprise. the voices changed

we were mostly blinded by the
