Craig Zipne coils and delivers, but to no avail, as Grinnell lost two double-
headers to end the season. The Pioneers ended at a dismal 2‘14.

 

finals loom

by Dave Calvert
Rain and cold weather forced post-
ponement of four key games Tues-
: day and Wednesday as the intra~
mural softball neared conclusion.
The four raineouts are the only
remaining games, but all four are
decisive in determining which te-
ams will enter the play»offs. IM-
softball Commissioner Jim Casey
will be contacting leaders of the
teams involved to work out mnkc-
no dates as soon as possible.
Off Campus
The only squad currently assured
or a semi-final play-ctr berth is
Off Campus, by virtue of its clutch
6-4 victory over Norris. Second
. place in the southern division is a
tosseup between Read and l-laines,
each team 4.2 with a game re-
maining. If both win or both lose
their final regular season tilts, a
one-game quarter—final will decide
which of the two rivals gets a shot
at 00 and the South Campus crown.
Up on North Camp is things are even
more complicated Norris and Y0?
unkers,‘ each 5-2, have cinchcd ties
for first place. However, ,Gates-
Langan and the Profs, each 4-2,
have games rcmainingagainstLoose
and ClevelandsJamcs, respectively,
and will probably come up with wins.
Thus, a four-way tie for first place
seems in the works.
Playpii
A two-game elimination play-off
system has been devised by Comme
issioner Casey in the event of a
four-way North tie. Gateselangan

Golfers Ready

by Arturo Tapia

The Grinnell College goll confer—
ence champs will be out to defend
their golf crown next week at Sq~
uawk Creek Golf course in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa. Led by Conference
individual champion Ken Ellenson,
the Pioneers should prove a strong
contender for the crown against
the favored teams of Carleton, St.

Olaf. and Monmouth. ‘
Also expected to contribute heavily
to the sandbagger‘s title hopes are
Arturo Tapia, who has played cons-
istently better since making the hole
in one, and PeterFriend, whoseems
to excel when tough opposition is
confronted. Al lesson and John
Rensennouse, although inexperien-
ced in conference play, have shown
throughout the season that they are
\capable of playing excellent golf,
and it is ,expected that they will
again rise to the occasion.
' . - , their last

will take on Norris on Mac Field,
while Yolnkers and the Profs brit—
‘tle it out on the soccer field. The
winners will collide the next day
on Mac Field for the North Campus
title.

lrackmen Try Hard

by Mark Blanchard

CEDAR RAPDS, IA--On Saturday,
May 4, a small squad of 12 Plon-
eer tracksters took to the road to
compete in the C09 Invitational ag-
ainst 12 other schools. About two
thirds of the schools ﬁnished with
more points than Grinnell.

The Coe meet was run very poor-
ly, costing Grinnell a place in the
100 yard dash. Mark Schultz ran a
10.2 100 for the third fastest time
of the day, but was third in his
heat and was not allowed to com—
pete in the finals. If he had been in
any other heat he would have won
his heat. If they had run semi-
finals as they should have, he wo-
uld have qualified for them.

In the three mile run‘ Dave Raub
and Tom Howland ran fantastic
races. They ran together for the
first two miles, starting off slow
and gradually picking off places.
Raub had a great time of

14:45.7. Tom Hleand finished in
Sixth with another fine time, 15:
09.

Other Grinnell place rs were Dave
Wright with a third in the long jump
and a fourth in the triple jump,
and the mile relay team with afi-
fth. The members of that relaywere
David Jenney, Lincoln Marshall,
Mark Blanchard, and Jim Briles.

against Big Eight schools in the
Drake Relays Invitational. Ellenson
showed the form that won him the
individual crown last year as he
led the Pioneers with two fantas-
tic rounds of 74 and 76. Tapia also
performed well and came 'in With so-
ores of 81 and 74. John Rensen-
house shot 83 and 84 While Al Jes-
sen posted marks of 85 and 87 to
round out the Pioneer effort. The
team‘s combined score of 648 left
the sandbaggers dead last in the
field of much stronger opponents.
The Pioneers are counting on a
strong legion of supporters to fol-
low them next Thursday andFriday.
Admission is free and play should
begin around 10:00 am Everyone
is encouraged to come out and sup-
port the sandbaggers in their quest
for retaining their Conference golf
Crown. If all goes well, the Pion-
eers should win, given their exper-
ienced and seasoned nla underpre-

The Grinnell baseball squad tra-
veled to Lambni, Iowa for their
last away games last week, a dbu-
blcheader with Graceland College.
Graceland came out on top in both
contests by scores of 15-5 and 10-
3. The Pioneers wrapped up their
season later in the Week with a
doubleheader loss to Iowa Confer-
ence champion Coe (Coe goes on to
the Midwest Conference playoffs).
Tlle Pionee rs finishedthe refore with
a 2-14 season record
' Copeland Debut

In the first game with Graceland
freshman Dave Copeland made his
Varsity debut and was hit hard by
the Graceland lumbermen. Grace-
land scored 14 of their 15 runs in
the first three innings Mark l-lani—
sch replaced Copeland in the later
innings and finished up the game.
Grinnell showed some spark when
they erupted for four runs in the
sixth inning. The rally was capped
off by a Z—run single by Hanisch

with the bases loaded and two outs. .

Craig Zippe went three for thme in
the game with three one-bagge rs and
Paul Delaney garnered two hits in-
cluding a double. Phil Frank tripled
and John l-laigh also added a base
hitl
Grinnell andGraceland were locked
in a close 2-1 battle in the bottom
half of the doubleheader through
five innings. Craig Zippe was pitche
ing and thingsilooked rosy. Then
in the sixth Phil Frank hit a 2-
run homerun to put Grinnell ahead
3—2 and it looked secure. But then
the Graceland bats started connect-
ing and before Hanisch was able to
disconnpct them, after relievingZi-
ppe midway through the bottom of
the Sixth, Gracelandwas ahead 10—3.
That was the final score,
Hot Hitting
Zippe continued his hot hittingwltll
a double and a single and an RBI,
and other hits came off the bats of
David Wynberg and Matt Brennan
Frank added a single to balance his
homerun. Brennan caught both
games turning in a commendable
performance. /
Against cos the Pioneers were held
to just one hit in each game. Zippe
w nt the distance in the first game
b t received no offensive aid, and
was victimized by sloppy fielding
at times. The lone Grinnell hit was
a clean one, a line single off the bat
of Bill Johnson. Coe got nine hits
off Zippe and five runs. When Gri-
nnell runners were able to get
on base they were usually erased on
double plays by the slick Coe de—
fense or running mistakes. It was
not one of the Pioneers better eff-
orts.
Second Game

Paul Delaney started the second
game and was given a one run lead
in the first inning When Wes Fujii
walked, advancedtothirdonanerror
by the shortstop, and scored on a
fielder’s choice. However, Coe pl-
cked up five runs over the next
three innings as Delaney’s control
was off. Coe picked up four more
runs in the fifth on four hits. Han-
isch replaced Delaney during the fi»
fth and finished the game giving up
three more runs inthe seventhGri-

This has not been the best year
for Grinnell athletics. While the
majority of the teams have not had
Winning seasons, there is reason
to hope that next year’s record
will be much improved. This has
been a year of change for Grinnell
athletics, with new coaches and the
beginning of an evaluation of Grin-
nell athletics.Next year will also sh—
ow a new coach as five men are
currently being considered forapo-
sition in the physical education den
partment.

The new coach will be the head
basketball coach, replacing EddBo-
wers, who replaced Ray Boyd. Tile
new man will also have duties in
football and either baseball or ten-
nis. The basketball team was one
of several teams that did not end
up with ‘a final record meeting the-
ir pre-season hopes. The football
team wound up with a 0-9 record,
their worst since 1952. However
there is reason for hope for next
year as coach Bowers has some of
the team’s best returning. Among
these is freshman Paul Delaney,
probably the school’s best fresh-
man athlete this year. Delaney was
also a member of the school’s has»
ketball and baseball teams.The for-
mer was unsuccessful due to in-
ternal problems, the latter due a
lack of pitching and depth.

Tom Vanderyheyden, an RA, was

nnell scored again in the fifth when

Frank Walked with the bases loaded
forcing in the second run. The one
hit for Grinnell was a sharp single
by Bill Warren.

The Pioneers started four fresh-
man and two sophomores regularly
throughout the season which can only
mean a more competitive team in
seasons to come. Seniors Fujii,
Johnson, Warren, andFrank allper-
formed well throughout the season
and especially in the late games
when old men usually feel the str—
ains of advancing years. They were
all starters and will be missed
but hopefully others can pick up

the slack.

Solid Infield

Lack of consistentpitching, hitting,
and outfield play plagued the squad
throughout the season and those de-
ficiences must be remedied before
a winning team can be built. Hower
er, the infield play was solid thr»
oughout and three of the four infie 1d—
ers will be returning. The season
seemed a bit long at times as one
loss followed another, butwitllbase-
ball players hope springs eternal
as does eternal hope fol‘ spring and
next year could just be another st—
ory.

Netmen Dwarfed

by John Lorn

This past week the Grinnell tennis
team showed some good clutehtennis
but came up with only mediocre
results. The Pioneers, although pi—
aying with more confidence, dropped
two out of three matches to schools
that have traditionally beaten the
Pioneers. The Pioneers were man-
handled by lowa State University,
6-3, then rebounded m squeak past
St. Olaf 5—4, only to get destroyed
by Carleton 8-1.
in their match against ISU, the
Pioneers started in great fashion
with both number one singles player
Brad Vazales and number two sin-
gles player Neil Trabich picking
up quick and relatively easy tri.
umphs. However, the Pioneers fail.
ed to win any other matches during
the meet except for the Vazales and
Trabich number one doubles team
that romped by a score of 7—6,
6-3.

Beats St. 91a! 1

Grinnell got back into the win col-
umn with a tight match againstCon-
ference rival St. Olaf. Winners for
the Pioneers were‘ Vazales, Andy
Bloom (in a close, “noniwimpout”
three set match), Dan Edwards,
and the num‘ocr one duo of Vaza—
leseTrabich. However, allthe dra—
ma of the meet came down to the
last and deciding doubles match in
which the Pioneers’ number two
doubles team of Edwards and Paul
Van Schilfgaardc won a three set
match in which the last set went
into tie.breaker and was won by a
score of 7.5.

However, Grinnell’s lphoria was
shattered when the Pioneers were
soundly trounced by a better Carl.
Eton team. in this competition Carl—
eton showed that it was in great
shape to defend its Midwestern
Conference title. Though several
of the matches wcnt three sets, the
only Pioneer to win, was Fresh-
man Dan Edwards, who remains un-
defeated in conference play.

The soccer team had the talent,
but fell short of its goals. Still,
though graduation will hurts, some
very key people will be returning.
The team with perhaps the most to
look forward to is Ray Obermiller’s
cross country squad, as they will
have an entire team returning.

Obermiller also coached the Schr
ool’s most successful team, the
Pioneer swimming team. Paced by
All-American backstroker BobWin—
ters the tankers placed a strong
third in the Midwest conference and
show signs of being able to win it
next year. The conference meetwill
be held at Grinnell next year.

It has been several years slnoe
the wrestlers have won a dual meet
but this year’s seventh place conf-
erence finish could be an indication
of better things to come for Mo
Hunt’s squad. With a new coach
and good returning players next
year’s basketball squad can hope
to improve the dismal records of
recent years.

Though possessing some fine indi-
vidllal talent, the indoor aqdnutdoor
track teams hive been plagued this
year by both a lack of depth and

the premier spot are rather dim.
However, the Pioneers are capable
of upsetting some of the conference
powerhouses and could possibly end
up in the top rive positions.

First round play concluded‘and se-
cond round matches began this week
in the Grinnell Mixed Tennis Tour—
ne .

Ill, the first round the majority of
teams opted to play two out of three
sets, but few actually had to go
on to a third. Craig Zippe andsusan
Pride easily defeated Luther and
Jenny Erickson in straight sets,
6-1, 6-1. Torn Saﬂey and Michele
Rothenberg overcame their oppon-
ants, John and Shelly Blair, 6-3,
6-2. Allen lessen and Carol Brae-
zael likewise won 6-3, 6»? in their
match against Al Btesch and Judy
Markewich.

Also winning in two sets wereJohn
Haigh and Sara Keene over Rickie
Stokes and Roxanne Brovm, 6-2,
6-4. Tom Goetz and Karen Meyer
were outlcassed by Kent Christian
and Linda Peden, 6—1, 6-1. Wayne
Moyer and Ellen Yaclmin quickly
eliminated Mark Dickinson and
Helen Randall, 6-1, 6-3.

John Pfitsch and Mary Damsgaard
squeaked by Dave Calvert and El-
aine Carey in a close match, 6»2,
4-6, 6-4. Also splitting sets and
going on to a deciding third were
Ken and Karen Davis, who finally
fell to Bob Donelan and Tracy Hul-
ing, 4-6, M, 6-2.

Hal Goodman and Ellen Grady suc-
cessfully combined to overtake Sir:
George and Patty Jassak in a pro
set, 10.2. Also moving on to the
second round by forfeit were Jeff
Reed and Jen Jenkins.

In an early second round match
Arnold Adelberg and Batsy Wolcoft
demolished ReedEndo and LindaTh-
iemann, 6-0, 671. Second roundplay
will continue this week and must be
completed by May 12.

The netmen have performed well,
being in the thick of a fight to fin-
ish in the first division of the con-
ference. Notable this season has
been the play of freshman DanEd~
wards, who to date has lost just
two singles matches while winning
nine. The golfers, coached by Bo-
wers, join their baseball mates in
being plagued by bad weather.

The women’s program at Grinnell
is feeling growth, with a larger
budget planned and mom sports of—
ferings planned. Though not winning
any titles, the women’s field hockey,
swimming and tennis teams have
performed well.

This space has been occupied most
of the year by investigations ofvar—
ious aspects of Grinnell sports.
Men’s, women’s and the philosophy
behind the overall program have
been examined and suggsticns have
been made about all of them. Next
year will open with anexamination of
the idea of the scholar-athlete, fact
or fiction.

Not just Grinnell‘s athletic pro-
gram, but athletics in general have
been discussed in this space. At
times what has been written here
has been controversial and has br-
ought criticism from many sides.
Next year, this space will feature
more investigative reporting, more
in the way of personality features,
and reports of sports items of more
interest to the student body as a
whole.
