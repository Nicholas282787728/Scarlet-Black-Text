\Vhat do you thinlr about it? This is
the question which every student in
the institution should ask himself
concerning the new plan proposed by
Mr. Fisher in regard to the semester-
iee, This is a serious question, pro
posed by serious men with a serious
intention. Mr. Fisher is sincere in his
desire to see such a plan adopted and
has good reasons for it which will be
presented in a laterissue of this paper.
Just now it is the desire to get as
many opinions as possible from in-
dividual students. For this purpose
the SCARLET dc BLACK has issued
“Opinion Cards.” They may be had
at tile President’s ofﬁce at any time.
On them Opportunity is given to ex-
press ycur ideas on the subject on.
semester iee and the more promptly
and fully these are given the sooner
the matte-1' will be brought to a settle-
ment one way or the other. When you
have Written your opinions place the
card in the SCARLET 81% BLACK box on
the east wall or the video. alter sign-
ing your name. Ask question, suggest-
changes in the plan or additions to it,
tell why you approve or disapprove of
tha plan, oranything else you sincerely
consider as bearing on the subject.
Tile SchlanTtZt BLACK expects to
keep this question b'efare the college
until deﬁnite arrangement is reached
one way or the other. Aclose watch
will be kept on the trend of Opinion
and any specially good suggestions
will be made publicalongwith general
information in regard to the matter.
Incidentally, it might be said that
these cards are for the use of faculty
and alumni as well as students and

When it is recalled that he is a gradu‘

true, Those who know Mr. Heeren

Those who have not had the pleasure

SCARLET AND BLACK

The interest and value of the talk
given at Humboldt Society should
bring suddenly to our senses these or
us who have hereroiore neglected the
work of this important organization,
It is at its meetings that the Faculty
oi Iowa College presents the resultsoi
much lmrd and patient eoort. Nearly
alloi our instructors are Eoingresearch
workin their various holds and their
kindness in inviting the student hody
to come and near the results of that
work should not go unneeded. The
attendance of students at the monthly
meetings oi the Humboldt Society is
very small. Why shouldn't we gireit
the same encouragement anti support
which its members give student
enterprises oi all and many kinds.

MISS HEUER'S RECITAL.

Next Friday evening at the Cong‘l
church Miss Iieuer Will give her ﬁrst
recital beiore' a Grinnell audience.
This is her ﬁrst year as teacher of
vocal inthe Scltooloi Music. Through-
out the year she has sung with the
Vesper and Congregational church
choirs and has made a very pleasing
impression,

Miss Heuer’s only appearances here
as a soloist, aside iron: her work with
the choir, were at the organ recital
and atthe rendition of “The Messiah"
and on both occasions her success was
pronounced.

She has gi yen of her time and
strength ireely and gladly tor the

public‘s pleasure and we hope that on .

this account and becauseshe is a new-
comer to this city thatGrinnell people
will show their appreciation or her
work by going in large numbers to
hear her song recital on the School of
Music Course at the Cong‘l church
Friday evening at ” ’ A better
reason ior going, however, would be
the assured high merit of the even
ing's entertainment.

A rather remarkable class in mission
study met for the ﬁrst time Monday
evening. It is composed mostly of
about a dozen senlors and is a con rse
in “comparative religion.H being the
hrscoi its kind ever attempted by the
Y. M. C. A. mission department. It
promises great value both as a. study
of the merits of the various kinds of
religion and as an opportunity to
openly discuss questions of Vital re-
lation to a man's life.
