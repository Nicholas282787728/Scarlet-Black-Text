Nebribska Cracks Local Defense
In Second. Hall} to Win by
32-19 Score.

The Pioneer quintet dropped the
first two tangles in the present series
of home games to Oklahoma and Ne—
braska. The Sooner-s went to the
showers Saturday night with the long
end of a «3—31 score, while the Corn—
huskers trampled on Grinnell Mun-
day night to thé dirge of 32.19.

Oklahoma's long distance attack
was too much for Grinnell and the‘
Sconers downed the Pioneers in a
fast game in which the local quintet
performed brilliantly at times but
was unable to stop the Sooner offen-
sive headed by Wallace and McBride.

Grinnell scored first when Boge
dropped in a basket a few moments
after the play had begun. Benz
made the count three for Grlnnell and
then the Oklahoma siege got under
way. The Sooners repeatedly sank
long ones from near the center of the
floor and shortly obtained a lead
which they held the remainder of the
game.

Gl-lnnell scored on even terms with
her opponents in the last half but the
early lead was then much to overcome
and the southerners emerged with a
twelve point advantage.

The High Scorers

The Scarlet and Black attack was_
lead by Benz who sank three field
goals and five free tosses for a total
of eleven points. Bogs was also a
main factor in the Pioneer scoring.

McBride, Sooner forward, who ls

accounted for fourteen points all of

President J, H. T. Main Pays
Stirring Tribute to War
President at Chapel.

in honor of the memory of Wood—
row Wilson, President J, H. T. Main
spoke Monday morning at a special
chapel exercise on the late president.

”President Wilson-s place in history
will emerge from the bitterness of po-
litical strife into a larger place; larg—
er than We can comprehend,” said
President Main.
‘fTime weighs men accurately with.
out regard to their policies, and the
naked souls of men claim their right
place. So will the soul of Wilson.
His ideals have been judged as not
practical. but if these ideals have
any truth in them, they are practical,
even though men have laughed at
them—because they Will go to fulfill-
ment."
In Concluding, President Main said,
"President Wilson-s place in history
will be based not on his mistakes but
on the principles for which he stood."
Did \Vilson full? Not yet! Ask your
llildl‘en's children if Wilson tailed.
You cannot hurt a good man, for a
good man cannot fail, his principles
go on for all time.”

Further Tribute Rendered

As additional tribute to president
Wilson, the flag on the campus was
put at half mast, and a resolution of
sympathy was sent to Mrs. Wilson.
Grinnell has a special interest in Mr.
Wilson, since, during the campaign of
1912, while speaking rrom the rear end

he referred in touching terms to Pro-
fessor Jesse Macy for whom he had it
warm regard.

President Main's chapel
commemorating Mr. Wilson was given
front page space in Tuesday's Des
Moines Register.

Local Quintet Gets Hard Drills

The pioneers tackle the husky Knu-
sas Aggie quintet Friday night in the
third of the series of home games for
the Scarlet and Black machine.

The Aggies, although lacking any
particular star, have a well balanced
team, standing well above Grinnell in
the Valley race, and it will take fast
basketball on the part of Mentor Mac~
Eacliron's proteges to win.

The Aggies nosed out the Pioneers
by two points on the Grinnell floor last
year, alter they had previously been,
beaten at Manhattan, so Captain Benz
and his men are out for revenge.
Furthermore, a victory for Grinnell‘
would advance the Pioneer team froml

has been for years an ardent advocate
'ofinterllationalpcztce. Previous to
the war, when he was widely known
as an author and editor, he was assoce
