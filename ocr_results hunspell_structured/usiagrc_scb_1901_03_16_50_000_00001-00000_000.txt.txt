audience at once. Mr, Hubbard
is a paradox. The petty vindict»
ivencss of some of his writingsand
the lrarrowness of his views on ad
ucation are in marked contrast to
the broad, humanitarran principles
whichanimate thewoikoftthoyr

to make practical the theory of
Ruskin and Morris, that art is the

Hubbard isbut following Froebcl’s
kindergarten methods. It rs a

a workman put into a piece ot

gives an aesthetic satisfaction to
the most cultured. It is but a re-
echo oi Ruskin’s appreciation ot
the ruggedness and individuality
ot Gothic as opposed to the soul»

With Ruskin, Mr.IIubbard decries
the excessive use or, machinery as
destructive of all true and beatni-
tvork. The work bl tlle Roy-
trotters is done almost entirely by
hand.

Humanity rather than money is
the ﬁrst consideration of the Roy

by what he is and can do rather
than by his past is tllc realization
of that social ideal so longed for
by Victor-Hugo.

as instilling renewed faith in the
essential goodncss of things.

Coming Intercollegiate Debate.

Grinncll's Intercollegiate Der
bate will be held with \rVashburn
at Topeka, Kansas, April Istllt
The reasons why Grirlnell has
gone ottt of the state for a debate
tthis year have been fully explains
led in previous issues. Washburn
holds much the same position in
educational circles ill Kansas that
Gr inncll holds ill iowa, The early
history otthc two colleges was
nruch the same. so that they have
like traditions, ideals and Spirit.
and it seems not unﬁtting that we
should have a frielldly contest
with them.

The question proposed by
Washburn is: “Resolved that the
permanent retention of the Phil-
ippines would be detrimental to
the United States.” Grinnell chose
the Negative. This is a question
whose Issues are broad and whose
interest is Vital, A question
which the American mind must
grapple with and solve.' A debate
on this question ought certainly
to arouse the interest of the stu
dent body. Tire team is working
with a grim determination to win.
They feel that the student body
is behind them perhaps more in
this debate than it has ever been
behind a team before. (Usually
no inter-est has been shown until
a week or so before the debate.)
They feel that something has got
to be done or else we must stop
debating, and they are sparing no
ctlortto dosomcthing, They also
feel that the alumni, some of
whom have shown an interest in
the way that counts most. have a
desire for their success. Wash-
‘uurn maintains a chair of Oratory
and naturally her team will be
well trained in their delivery,
