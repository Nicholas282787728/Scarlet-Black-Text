With a grain of salt Billy did a bad, bad thing

By Dan Rothschild

Dear Salt,

My ex broke up with me six
months ago and said he wanted
to be friends but now he won’t
even talk to me. I tried
emailing him, wanting to just
sit down and talk to him, but
he won’t even respond. Why
would he say he wants to be
friends with me yet treat me as
though I’m not even there?
Don’t I mean anything to him.>

Confused

Dear Confused,

I’m sorry to he the one to tell you this, but it seems as though he wants nothing to do
with you. He won’t tell you faeerfo-Eicc because lit-’5 lusi not man enough. It hurts-l You
have every right to be mad or pissed off. but, just keep in mind. his actions are not a
reflection on you He's the stupid one. Yes, you mean nothing to him, but why would
you want to mean something to sonieonewho obviously doesn’t care about your feelings,
You would he doing yourselfa Inigo favor by just not having anything to do with him.
Don't call him, email him, anything. lfyou see him, ignore him. It's obviously what he
wants There are so many wonderful people out there 7wliy would you want to waste
time with this particular individual=

Hold your head up,

Malaika Wiley

Dear confused,

Iwould suggest that you always say hi to him when you see him, Tliatway you are on
speaking terms with him without having to invest in a friendship when he cleaily either
doesn't want one or is not yet ready for one. I would avoid confrontations with him and
just say hi. This campus is small and you might find yourself in a class with him, an
awkward situation ifthe two ofyou are not speaking.

As for why he may have said he wanted to he friends, I can only guess that he may
have been trying to be nice. It is also possible that the two of you define friendship
differently, In the future it might hewise to make sure that when you decide to be friends
with an eat, the two ofyou discuss what being friends would man because different
deﬁnitions offriendship cause problems. He may have wanted to be your friend to avoid
feeling guilty but can't face you now. Who knows? Hard as it may he to understand why
people say things they can't fulfill, it doesn’t matter. You are through needing (0 have this
man figured out. Try to use that energy to notice. other things. observe and analyze
yourself, other friends, art. or nature.

You might also consider whether you actually want to be friends with him. Do you
like and respect him?And secondly are you ready to he his friend without too much pain
from the failed relationship?

Take Care,

Anyone remember Monica Lewinsky
our collective memory has tried as best to
exorcise her character, much like it would
banish the memory a bad acid trip, so it
comes as a quite a siirpi-i e io recall that
today is only the one y i anniversary or
the House ofItepresentativcs voting to inie
peach a sitting President for “high crimes
and misdemeanors," the first time such a
vote had been taken in over l 30 years. Now,
liken good parentiveasa tiation must look
within ourselves and ask our little child,
“What have you learned from this mis.
take?" And otit littlechild, the Presidentof
the United states, responds with a conclu.
sive, “Don‘t get caught again "

That appears to be the only lesson that
Bill Clinton has taken out ofhis dropped»
drawers debacle. He managed to convince
the American people at the time ofliis ini.
peachment that this was merely the House
of Representatives posturing, holding up
for public ridicule, stampingascatlet letter
on his chest, And like sheep, we sat back
and believed him.

The lesson we have learned over the last
year is twofold First, we now know that
it’s okay to commit pcryury a felony pun.
ishable on the federal level by 10 years im-
prisonment 7 if the lie is about sex. This
sets up a nice precedent for future divorce/
cristody settlements, family court cases, and
spousal abuse prosecutions. There is no
longer any compelling reason to tell the
truth while on daewitness stand ifthe ques-
tion is one ofa “personal nature.” (of
course, most of us don’t have the advan.
tage offitst claiming executive privilege and
dren attorney—client privilege before rolling
out out—right lies.) In divorce and other
family—related cases, both criminal and civil,
die sexual practices ofa party can often be
quite relevant to the case. Imagine a Judge
ruling that a mother got sole custody of
lierchildtcn, despite her penchant hit spon-
soring Eyes limit shirt—esoue sot parties in
her home. lfshe could denysuch practices
but face no prosecution for her be, what
would the effects he on her children? The
extramarital sexual activities of alleged
spouse abusers and victims of that abuse
often is exculpatory or mitigating in a Court»
room. But now will this evidence ever see
the light ofday? Granted, the rules on the
books have not changed. but we have set
up a new national ethos that essentiallysays
thar'lying about sex while under oath is
perfectly acceptable Try getting a jury to
convict a person for a behavior the President
of die United states 7 the top law.enforcer
in the nation 7 got away widi Scobh’cc,

The second lesson our nation has learned
from this is that we should have no reason to
expect any integrity or sense ofvirtuc from
our national leaders. Bill Clinton wagged his
pointer linger at its and assured us all that he
“did not have sexual relations with that

woman"; less than a year later he admitted
that he, in fact, did. Moreover, he did it while
talkingon thephone with members quun»
gross and performing other oflicial acts of
office. But despite this, our nation has for.
given him and his conduct, reasoning that
boys will be boys, (Is this also out rationale
for not pursuing Juanita Broddcrizk’s rape
allegations against Chilton?) Respect for
Washington, something that Americans
once had, has totally been eroded; we no
longer see our statesmen as role models, but
businessmen trying to sell its a product Bill
Clinton's sexcapades were the straw that
broke our national back, and our reaction
proved once and for all exactly how we feel
about mufaiiyrrcpllgnam, pathologically- a
rag, self—righteous sexual predators we love
them, as long as they keep up .i good
economy. (In this case, the economy is one
that the previous nvo presidents set into mo»
Iion.) Essentially, as longas Iget more money
in my paycheck and [have a good life, any
goofball can govern. Let us not forgot that
Benito Mussolini made the Roman trains
tiin on time. Would we elect him 7 or
Stalin, Ceausescii, Hitler, Pinochet, Mao, or
any other fascist or totalitarian dictator be»
cause ofany personal gains that we as in .
vidtials forseeas coming from hiselection> I
used to thinknot. but I'm not sure anymore,

so that's what we've learned: periuty
about sex is Just hire, and morally bankrupt
national leadership tea-okay. i lowivhat has
Bill Clinton learned

The answer here is pretty simple Not
much. He publicly derided the impeach»
nient proceedings and treated them with an
unconscionahly cavalier attitude, until it
looked as ifsuch an attitude might actually
give the Senate hitthet reason to convict him,
currently, in an altogether underexplored
affair, the President has granted clemency
to several violent Ruetto Rican nationalists,
This would not be unusual if circumstances
were regular, but Mrs. Clinton is nrnning as a

President. Remember, yoll may still have your
