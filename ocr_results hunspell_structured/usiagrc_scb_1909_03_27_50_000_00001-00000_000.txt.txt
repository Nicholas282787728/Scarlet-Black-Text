The
basketball team oi 1909 was one ovci
which any loyal friend or Gl-innell and
her splendid athletic history may well
enthuse. anti it is worthy ol the best
honors the students may give.

The outlook lor the college team, lmr
mediately iollcwing the vacation, nov.

selection of a ioi-ward to play Klein'l

Normal a number or experiments were

in determining which were the best
oualined material tor these two posi
tions. in spite ot the tact that the
Normal game was in the nature oi a
laboratory test in the science of has-
ketball, the wearers oi the scarlet and
black ran away with the Norinalites
irimning up a score of 53719.

still the victories continued to come
in, and when the Des Moiiios Y. M, C,
A, was able to score but six points
while Gl'innell piled up 31, visions oi
another intercollegiate championship
began to take tangible lorm.

ln this contest the team lined up in
the way which they played most or
the season: Rowell and Carney, lor-
wards: the two MacEaclli-on brothers
the guards, and Ziegler the center po-
sltion. This combination was able to
win in all the contests where it was
