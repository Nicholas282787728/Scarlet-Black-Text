but to pursue Kosovo action

By JOHN BREEMER

News/opinion editor

The United States,asacliartermemr
ber of NATO, has little choice but to
continue its role in prosecuting the
action against Yugoslav President
Slobotlun Milosevic, US. Rep.
Leonard Boswell said here Thursday,

ln Grinnell to discuss Social» Se—
curity at the Senior Center, the 3rd
District Democrat said in an inter-
view ihat too many people are ig-
noring the fact that 19 NATO nations
were unanimous in determining that
the alliance had to act in orderto stop
thepersccutionofKosovarAlbanians
and thc “ethnic cleansing" being pur-
sued by Mllosevic’s government.

“ch, we are a participant, but we
are a charter member ofNATO, and a
lot orpcople don‘t seem to remember
that," the congressman remarked
“There are horriblcthings going onrn
Kosovo~ genocide, atrocities, driv-
ing people out of their homes. I was
talking to the Vice president a couple
ofhoursago, and hewastalking about
someone having direct contact with a
youngster wiro had been forced out of
her home in the middle of the night
and had her father taken away. We
can't allow things of this nature to
happen."

 

 

 

 

 

Gore in Jasper County

Vice President Al Gore was in
nearby Jasper County late last week
to campaign forthe 2000 Democratic
preSidential nomination. Boswell ac-
companied Gore on pan of the visit
and has endorsed the vice president‘s
candidacy.

Although Boswell acknowledged
that this is the first time NATO has
had to act in a non-defensive manner,
he said that isn’t really the point.

“It's a hard Situation whenyou have
to decide to put our young men and
women in the armed forces in harm‘s
way," he said. “It’s very hard, But I
don’t scc an alternative. I think you
have to do what you have to do inthis
world. We are a leader, and we are a
part of NATO. [ shudder to think
what would have happened in Europe
after World War II if there hadn‘t
been a NATO.

“As unfortunate as the situation is
that's going on, we have to do it."

An epiphany in Dachau

Boswell recalled bcrng in post-war
Germany with his wife and a German
couple they had befriended. The four
were traveling toward Bavaria, and
during the course ofthe visit noted a
road sign pointing toward Dachau,
the infamous concentration camp.

“Russia right now is in a position

said.

Farm recovery ‘will take awhile’

Boswell also was asked about the
farm economy, and he said that “it's
going to take awhile" for agricultural
commodities to have a resurgence in
terms of prices.

“For three years in a row, we‘ve had
a glut ofproduction everywhere in the
world," he noted.

Will there be some ﬁne—tuning ofthe
current farm program?

College buys
former glove

Grinnell College has acquired the
former Morrison, McIntosh and Co;

However, both the college’s short-
and long-term plans for the structure
are not clear.

purchased the property from First
Federal Savings Bank. -

According to Russell Osgood, col-
lege president, the Des Moines firm

vation and use ofthe space.

The property is bounded by Broad
St. and Second and Third avenues. '

Osgood said the college will use
the building as “interim space for a
varietyofyet»to-be-determinei:lneeds
that stem from the campus master
plan.“

Consultants are at work on that
plan, and a ﬁnal report is expected
this fall.

Osgood said the college has not
decided how to use the property in the
long term.

“We hope it will be a great anchor
for our downtown, and we look for-
ward to hearing ideas from our archi-
tects and members of the community
as well," he said. ‘

Osgood added that the property
“might relate to, enhance and even
expand the core ofour downtown.“~

“Our number-one priority is to re-
spect a even enrich — the character
and historic features of the original
building while workingto modernize
systems and maximize use," he said.
