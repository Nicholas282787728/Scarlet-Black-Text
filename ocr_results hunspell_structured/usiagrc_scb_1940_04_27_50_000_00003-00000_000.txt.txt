GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

por’r
havings

By Jack Wile

From the looks of some of the
records of our prep trackmen, I
think it's about time we gave
them a little well-deserved consid-
eration. They have accomplished
some things in which this year’s
varsity squad doesn't exactly lead
the field.

Take those hurdlsrs, for Instance.
Any one of five Of them could
be a champion next year, Fred
Webb from Evanston, Illinois, is
l1 regular “handy man" about the
track. He's best in the hurdles,
though, having Won the ZOO-yard
10w hurdles in his state district
meet with the third fastest time
in the nation. A fall in a sub
ceeding race was all that kept
him from taking top honors that
year . . , he's a hroadjumper and
pole-vaulter, too . . .

.i v n

orvcl Burns hails from Des
Molnes, He was city champion
in the high hurdles while in high
school competition, and his half-
mile relay team won a place in
the Drake relays. Although Burns
has concentrated on die nil-yard
race, he’s working up to the
quarter-mile . . . he’ll ho a good
man either place . i .

s s
Then there‘s Bob Corrigan who
comes from sterling, Illinois. He
took third place in the high hiir-
dles in the state meet during his
high school days . ,

Frank Burns, Des Moines, and
John Powell. Crinnell. are two
more good hurdlers. Powell gar-
nered a second placc in the high

school scction of the Iowa state
Teachers relays . . .

But hiinllers aren't the only points
about those preps there's
Ken McCallum from Washington,
D C., who can sprint with the
nest of them, and he was chalked
up at least 22 feet in the broad
jump . . . * k
Bill Mclieon, Chicago, has aspira-
tions to be a pole vaulter next
year. the fact that he's city
champ in that event in Chicago
should give him a good start . . .

r a e
Bil] Louis, Harlan, and Ken
Stanley, Crinnell, can provide a
good race in anything from the
quarter on up . . ,

r a e
Even though we don‘t have an
abundance of weight throwers and
distance men in this group of
boys, we can still say that this
is by far the best freshman team
we've had in Grinncll for many
years. when we combine this
fact with a varsity squad of al-
ready oustanding men, it looks as
though Grinueli will have a track
