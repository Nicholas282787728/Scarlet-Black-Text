Flood Situation

When the new eavespouting
was put up in the men's gym-
nasium a month ago, athletic
officials were confident that
the rains would fall no more
during basketball tilts. How-
ever, the spring weather and
melting snow have caused the
freshlets to begin anew, and
so fiercely that four washtubs
lwel‘e required to keep the floor
reasonably dry during practice
Friday.

To solve this situation, col-
lege employees were busy Fri-
day at risk of life and limb
clearing snow from the roof of
the building, It is hoped that
the game tonight will continue
dry.

Rule Revision
Considered

Hall Eligibility Rules
Receive Criticism

Proposal to change the eliglb -
ity rules for intramural competi—
tion was considered at the meeting
of the intramural board Friday
afternoon and a committee was
named to investigate the change.

Discussion of the rule arose
from the disbarring from further
intramural play of Robert Reeser,
Clark hall man, who received an
invitation to compete on the track
squad, but who has declined to re—
port.

A test vote among members of
the board showed the three were
in favor of granting Recser special
dispensation in order that he might
compete in intramurals, while
three other members were opposed
to such action,

Reeser was ruled ineligible unr
der the following rule: Article
one, section 6, part A, which reads,
”Varsity coaches shall issue an inn
vitational Squad list, a copy of the
same to go to the intramural dl-
rector, before their sport begins.
Men whose names appear on this
list are ineligible for the contem-
porary intramural sport."

Suggestion that the rule be abol-
ished or revised was considered by
tho intramural board, and a come
mlttee was named to consider the
plan. Members of the committee
are: Richard Shirk, Dibble, Robert
Reecsr, Clark, and Ed Harvey,
Rawson.

other members of the intramur-
al board are: Robert Berry, Smith;
G. Lester Duke, intramural direc-

. tor; Ted Applequist, Langan; and

Walter Klein, Gates.

Still dissatisfied with the play
of his erratic cagers, Coach John
c. Truesdale this morning declin-
ed to name a definite starting
line-up for the Pioneers return
contest with the Washington
Bears here tonight at 7:30 o'-
clock.

After striving all week to in-
still new splrlt into his players
by means of revised lineups and
several shifts of players along
with intensive nightly workouts,
the Pioneer mentor is puzzled
whether to start his regular ﬁve,
or send High, general utility man,
and Fowler, senior guard, to the
forward hernis where they have
been working out during the
week.

Forwards Disappoiut.

Coach Truesdale has been es»
pecially disappointed in the play
of both Conwill and Hayward at
the forward positions where they
have failed to block properly on
screen plays and have shown a
decided inability to hit the hoop
at critical times. In 9. desperate
effort to bolster up the forward
line, he has tried several combin-
atlons.

Grinnell's chances for victory
over the Bears tonight are bright-
ened by the fact that Drake down-
ed the Washington team in a
hard fought game last night, 37»

ing on the rickety, home ﬂoor,
