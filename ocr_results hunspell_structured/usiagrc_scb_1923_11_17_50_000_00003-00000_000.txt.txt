should adhere to the Permanent Court

the order in which they will be con-

' ducted, will be announced within a
Iew days, according to John McGee,

'Grinnell Girl Gives
Minneapolis Recital

Lois Rogers, of the class of '21,
made an extremely successful debut
at the'Unltarian church in Minne-
apolis last week, according to the
Minneapolis Journal.

Miss Rogers was recently awarded
first prize in a scholarship contest
between the members of the master
classes of Mme. Bailey-Apleibeck, and
is said to show unusual promise.
During her years in Grinnell, Miss
Rogers studied under Dr. Edward B.
Seheve, who is mentioned in the Min—
neapolis accounts of the recital as
being largely responsible tor her abil—
it.

One oi the numbers on her program
which made the greatest appeal to
the large audience was "Sunset," by
Dr. Scheve.
