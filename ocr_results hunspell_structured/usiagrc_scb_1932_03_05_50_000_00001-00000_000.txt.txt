Pioneers Lose
Willie’s Party
by 38-27 Count

Center Makes 16 Points;
Grinnell Cagel‘s Halve
Ealrly Lead

Willie Schmidt, Creighton's six-
foot—eightrinch center, hovered over
his mates Wednesday evening in their
Omaha stronghold, and clicked for 16
points to protect the Bluejay-s un—
inarred Valley record, and incidental—
ly defeat the Crinnell Pioneer eager-s
33 to 27.

As a result, Schmidt not only Cb—
tained scoring honors for the ever
ning but passed Cornie Collin to win
the valley individual race.

Pioneers Lcail

The Pioneers grabbed an 1176 lead
in the first half. van Ackeren op-
ened the proceedings with a push-up
from under the basket, but Grin—
hell's Captain McCreai-y duplicated
the feat almost immediately. , A mo-
ment later he added a free throw and
after charity tosses by Kicly and Van
Ackeren of Creighton, and Duncan
and Ullrich of Grinnell, Rowe drop-
ped in a sirlc shot to put the Pioneers
in the lead, 7 to 4.

After Paben had tallicd from the
corner. Ullricb and Frye drew a bead
on the hoop and found the range for
shots which gave the scarlct and
black team its best advantage of the
evening.

willie Loans oier

Before' the half had ended, Van
Ackeren added a free throw, Miller a
field goal and charity toss. and Wil-
lie, himself. leaned over toward the
basket for four points, The best
that the Pioneers could do during this
period was to cash in on a free throw.

In the final period, Schmidt did
not wait so long to get stationcd near
the basket, and altho the Pioneers
battled mightily, working the ball
down the floor time and again, to
keep edging toward th r opponents
lead. it was VVlllle’s

Langan Wins
Cage Trophy

Last Quarter Spurt Downs
Dibble, 26.19

Langan hall annexed the 1932 me
tramural basketball trophy Monday
night With a last quarter spurt that
proved too much for the Dibble ‘ags
gregation, which up to that time had
kept on even terms with the champ-
ions.

Paced by Lewis Slye, and Bill
Welsh, all-dormitory selections,
Langan won by a 20-19 count, Each
team prcsentcd a combination of A

and B teams in the playoff for the Bennett was a steadying influence in joulnaliSm is the avowed purpose of,

title.

Dibble started out with a rush to
gain a four-point lead, but at llie
end of the first qiiartcr, Langan had
pulled up to a 473 Score. During the
second period, the winners forged HP
to the lead, and at the half the score
stood 1179. Langan pulled away
again in the third quarter, only to
have its lead wiped out, A last qllarv
lcr spurt was sufficient, however,
and Langan won by a safe margin.

Bread, Potatoes
Top Menu List
of Student Body

Bread and potatoes, the staff of
life, are the items upon which Crin-
nell athletic teams, debaters, singers
and other members of the student
body depend for their subsistence,

Mrs. Ethel Miller, supervisor of
the men's dining hall, estimates that
each day there are consumed. in the
two dining rooms, nine bushels of po-
tatoes, 175 loaves of bread, 50 pounds
of butter, and 12 pounds of coffee.

Since there are 252 days in the
college year, this means that in the
entire year there will be used ap-
proximately 2,268 bushels of pota»
toes, 44,100 loaves of broad, 12,600
pounds of butter, and 3,024 pounds
of coffee.

At this rate, the collegian who
kecps well in shape for spearing his
shce of bread and scooping up his
portion of potato, will eat in a single

year nearly four bushels of potatoes,‘

more than 70 loaves of bread, and
more than 20 pounds of butter.

A “bread—line” nearly 10 miles
long could be established if all the
loaves uscd here in a year, were cut
and the slices placed side to side. One
person, working eight hours a day,
would be forced to peel potatoes
steadily for more than two years, he»
fore he would have undressed enough
of the vegetables to fcccl the collcge
during its nineemonths year,

ketball champions, received unreal
places on the first alletlol'mitul'y
team this year, Dibble and Smith
were awarded the other two places,
while Gates, Clark, and Rawson were
represented on the second team.
Sire Leads Race

To draw a distinction as to the
ability of any of the players is a
difficult task, since there were few
outstanding players developed. To
give credit to some is to do injustice
to others, but the above selections;
represent to some degree the pop!
uiar vote of a numbcr of autho‘l‘lties.’

Lewis Slye led the intramural
scoring race, and is awarded his pal
sition without question. Paired with
him is Don Kingery, Smith hall’s
midget forward, who dominated scor»,
ing circles until the last game, when'
he dropped back to third place. He
formed almost a one—man team for,
Smith, and was acclaimed by several
members of the varsity squad as the
smartest player in thc founderobin‘
series.
I Welsh, Brown Guards

Chuck Bilto won his berth at cen-
ter by a narrow margin over Wurl
of Rawson. Rowatt of Clark, and
,Collisoo of Dibble. He was a vital
part of the Langan passing attack,
land to him goes much of the credit
for a successful season. Bill Welsh,|
member of Langan's B team, placed
sccond in the scoring race and is
placed at guard, along with Miller

of man of the Dibble A team.

Joy of Hearts,

Need [Eden

in 3 Systems
of Democracy

Speaker Lauds. MacDonald
in Talk on Crisis

of England

DemuCraCy‘S greatest challenge is
made by the question as to which of
the three systems of democracy will
prevail, English, American. or Rude
sian. This was the idea left by S.
K. Ratcliffe in an address on “Eng-
land in Crisis and Renewal” at Her-
rick chapel Friday evening

He questioned the possibility of
England’s being able to prevail with
an‘outworn parliamentary system,
which even now is failing to.meet the
needs and conditions of its changing
life; he wondered if America could
do it in the face of past and
present failures; and asked whether
Russian workers, driven by their suc-
cess of reorganization and the rising
spirit of their young people, could
make a democracy of communism.

Help Work Out

“And it is for you, with clear minds
and clear eyes, to see and help work
out a satisfactory answer,” was the
parting challenge given by the speak-
er.

Two divisions to his talk were
made by Mr. Ratcliffe, who is an
English journalist and was brought
here by the Des Moines and local
branches of the English Speaking
Union. The first was a summary of
the circumstances of the political
changes in England in 1931.

Discusses Economics

He gave a short history of the
Labor party as started in 1914 by
Ramsey MacDonald to its fall from
power in 1929 when MacDonald, upon
invitation of King George, resigned
to become prime minister of a na-
tional party which wiped out all op-
position in elections of 1931.

England's economic condition, be-
hind the depression, was the second
topic he discussed. He emphasized
the fact that while America has
known rcal deprcssion for about
three years, England and Eumpean
countries have known it for 10 years
or more.

Hard to Awaken

“It is hard to awaken a govern-
ment from romance to realism.” he
said, “but MacDonald came to I‘eali»
ty last August realizing the financial
cr‘ s when he learned that the Bank
of England would be ablc to meet
the national insurance demands for
little more than a week.”

Had the cabinet been able to force
see the crisl had industry and fine
ancial conditions been favorable, Mr.
‘Rdtclifte thinks that England would
have been able to meet and pass the
crisis,

Grout Leader

“MacDonald saw that national,
united government was wanted and
put aside constitutional policy," Rat-
cliffe asserted, “and kissed hands as
prime minister of the national party.”

He has 550 supporters out of 615
imembers in tlic house of commons
The speaker said that this made him
a greater leader than Pecl. Disraeli,
or Gladstone.

He characterized MacDonald as
skillful; possessing great powers of
acceptance, and powers of evasion.

Industries Confined

“The industrial system of the
nineteenth century has kept indus-
trial England within the confines of
five industries; namely, coal, iron and
steel, ship building, and cotton and
Wool," the speaker claimed in discusse
ing economic conditions, “In this
system there was unemployment to
cause anxiety to the government ev—
en when a new industry started.”

“There have been many specula-
tion , he explained. “concerning the
policy of the national government to-
wards iinemployment and the gold
standard. There is to be no change
in the structure and system of the
national insurance system but there
must be a change in administration
soon. This IS necessary to deal with
evils of the industrial system, shown
