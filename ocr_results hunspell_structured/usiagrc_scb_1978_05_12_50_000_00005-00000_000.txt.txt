y: a senior’s pastoral romance

Patty Best

Favel and Milk

once upon a time, at a small
liberal arts college tar, iar away,
there was a secondrsemester
senior named Favel. Favel was a
poor young orphan who wasn't sure
what she would do when she
graduated She had no home to go
to. and she had no particular
"calling" in life. Fave] had
something more of quickness than
many of her fellow students, and
thought perhaps that she might
become a governess, and impart
her knowledge to others. Still, she
didn't know what to do.

Her professors. not caring that
she was trying to make major
decisions about her life, unr
leelingly demanded that she hand
in papers and take tests. Fave]
found it hard to concentrate on
studying when she was tortured by
doubts about herself and her
future, and when she Wanted to
spend her last tew days in college
with the people she loved best
Sometimes at night. when she was
awakened by strange, far-off
music or eerie creaks outside her
door, she started to cry. It was
hard to realize that she no longer
had limitless semesters stretching

Ol all the conspiracies it has
been my privilege to be acquainted
\\ith. perhaps the most evil and
insidious is that of the SEA-l clique
which controls campus opinion.
This lightlyrknit hand of staff
members. sympathizers. and
iellow travclers is concentrated in
Smith Hall. wherc it is convenient
for them to meet rrequently to
launch their dastardly schemes.

The still cabal is. of course, tied
in with the network oi the national
media conspiracy directed by the
Jews, the Catholics. or the Come
mies ll can't quite figure out
which. but then they‘re all the
samei. This is the very samc
conspiracy that hounded Richard
Nixon from office, destroying the
best President we ever had.

out in frontof her. With time to care
about her work and time to get to
know people

THERE WERE nights when she
wandered the dim corridors of her
dormitory as it she sought
something. She found no answers.
Once she did meet a pizza delivery
man, but he stared at her oddly and
lelt quickly, leaving the iaint scent
of oregano behind him,

Things went ironi bad to worse.
One day Favel found herself
staring at crockpots in the Ace
Hardware Store because she didn't
want to write a paper. She didn't
want a crockpot. She didn't need a
crockpot She had no money with
which to buy a crockpot. Never-
theless. there she stood, comparing
prices.

TIER FRIENDS Iried to help her
out of her slough oi despolld. They
gave her presents: a wedding
picture of Donny Osmond, a copy
of Donna Parker Goes to
llollywood, and a lovely bath toy.
None of the presents helped.

Reading that Danny’s wife would
have a bit part in the new movie
“Aloha Donny and Marie" made

mcdlately stolen by a friend who
wanteda study break. The bath toy
was wonderiul, but Favcl only took
showers at school.

One day, Favel walked home
from a day of classes, It had been
an interesting day. She had gotten
to thc pont where only the bizarre
would catch her attention in class,
and every class that day had been
strange. One student in her French
class had said (In French) that
carrots liked him Favel had
thereupon drawn a beautiful
sketch ol carrots snuggling up to
him In another class, she got to
hear the “Fat Hamlet" theory The
professor in her last class of the
day had tried to smoke his chalk
and Write on the blackboard with
his cigarette. When Fave]. still
ruminating on the events of the
day, got to her door, she tound a
mysterious box addressed to her,

SIIE OPENED the box With
some trepidation, it did not contain
a knife or a threatening message or
any 0‘ that good stutt, Fave] had
been all ready to scream and faint,
too. She did perk up when she saw

the box it was “Milky the Mare

black and white plastic cow who
could drink, moo, and be milked
She evcn had a removable udder,
so that small White pellets could be

drunk. These pellets made it look
as though Milky was really being

Every time Favcl looked at Milky,
she got a sense or peace and calm.
She envisioned blue skies and
Unity clouds and sheep trolicking

She and Milky sat for awhile in a

around and the Sun was hot. Favel
turned to the gothic romance she
had with her. lfshe couldn't find an
answer in Nature, she might as
well sit and get tanned. She came
to a passage in the hook that she
particularly liked tshe had read
the book many times) and read it
aloud. “ “This encomlum, Louisa,

Richard, much moved," she read.

slightest epiphany. She still hadn't
