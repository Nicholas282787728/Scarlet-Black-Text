Possibility That Swimming
May Remain Sport Here
Seen at Meeting

A possibility that Grinnell may
retain varsity swimming on its next
years schedule was seen this week,
following the supposedly final meet-
ing of the 1932-33 student council
Sunday.

Members of the new council
with the retiring members as the
latter discussed apportionment of
semester fees next term, Because
of the fact that the council did not
reach an agreement, it was decided
to continue discussion at aj nt
meeting of the old and new council
Sunday, May 7, at which George
Van Nostrand, retiring president,
will preside and both new and old
members will vote.

Debate Cut

In regard to the swimming team,
it was moved by Walter Straley and
passed by the council that Dwight
Campbell, president—elect, should
appoint a committee to investigate
the possibility of cutting other dc—
partments in order to finance the
sport for next year. The committee
will report at the next meeting of
the combined council.

other definite action taken by the
council Sunday concerned the cut-
ting of the debate appropriation from
five per cent to three per cent, and
the turning over of the remaining
two per cent to the committee in
charge of the annual conference on
International Relations.

Peace Parley Gets $100

Davc Singer spoke for the confer-
ence, asking for a guarantee of $100
for next year for the purpose of
paying the main speaker at the
meeting. The council voted to give
the conference the two percentage
of semester fees, with the provision
that any money above 31ml which
is derived from this two per cent
shall be turned back to the debate
department.

A possi ility that debating - may
become a thing of the past was also
seen when the council discussed pos
sible uses for the remaining three
per cent of the debate allottiiient.
An exchange of student chapel
speakers among the colleges of the
state was suggested,

C cs Athletic Deficit

As chairman of the committee
which had been appointed to inter-
view Coach J. c. Truesdalc on ath—
letic expenses, Walter stralcy
ported that Mr. Trucsdale was ap-
poscd to cutting the price of the se-
mester fee, and that his department
could not get along with less.

Louis V. Phelps, college treasurer,
called into consultation, reported
that the sum of $9,300 can be col-
lected by the end of the fiscal year,
