Jefff Fields

I guess one would have to be:
“What does a senator do?” Trying
to defin the duties or the
responsib tes of a senator. I
guess writing their notes, and
posting notes of agenda. of SGA
meetings. is one thing, but I'd
like to see senators do more than
just go to meetings and represent.
I'd like to see more interaction
between the constituents, student
constituents, and the senators
It's something that's hard and
maybe very idealistic. because
it's assuming that everybody
wants to be involved in SGA,
even if it means just talking to
your senator. It's a small part,
and I’d really like to see that, but
it's hard, I guess second is,
SGA, like any other group or
organization, is a team, and it’s
really hard to take people and put

them together [or one year and
expect them to produce. There's
no real continuity to SGA,
whereas there are people who are
involved with SGA for all four
years that they are here, and they
are very vocal, and they do their
best. It is very difficult to
produce longrtcrm results, if.
because we don't have the
continuity, we don‘t have the
ability to create that continuity.
A number of the Cabinet
positions are two-year positions.
That creates more continuity, and
it would be nice to see more of
that, but the question I ask
myself as the vice-president, or as
anyone trying to make SGA a
stronger unit, [is]: “Well, what
changes can you make to increase
continuity?” It's a question that
is, for one, hard to answer. two,
that I really don‘t think can be

answered ln a positive manner.
We can say, “No, we can't do
anything more," but I‘d like to
think that we can at least try, but
I myself don’t have any ideas on
that situation.

Matt Moreland

The distance between SGA
and the rest of the student body.
Student government should be
the students, and I really believe
that students don’t pay that much
attention to what goes on in
SGA. They‘re dealing with lots
of money, and a lot of things
happen in SGA that really affect
[the campus]. With the vice-
president, where you‘re dealing
with academic affairs, it's very
important that students know
what’s going on and get involved
rather than just reading in the
bathroom stalls the minutes of

What would you like to see done with the curriculum?

JEI'I'f Fields

I'd like to see our curriculum
3 little bit more stringent, with
more stringent requirements, but
not much more stringent. If
there is going to be a change,
this isthe change I'd like to see.
I'm not saying, "I definitely want
this change, and I'll stomp my
feet if this change isn't made."
But if there is going to be a
change, this is what I'd like to
see: an eight- or IZ-credit
requirement per division, so that
each student takes at least two or
three courses in each division.
Most students do that anyway,
and I think if the 10 out of 1268
student who would have to
change their course choices over a
four-year period, I think , , . that
the experimentation and the
exploration that those students
would have to do are a valuable
learning experience. Sometimes
you've got to do things you don't
want to do, and I think that
would be good. [would be very
opposed to making any speciﬁc
course or type of course required,
beyond the tutorial, and beyond
possibly a junior or senior
tutorial, a seminar situation
where students talk about
interdisciplinary topics, where
students work as a group or as
individuals . . . to improve the
oral communication skills. I
think a lot of that gets ignored
and that's something, if there is
going to be n change, I'd like to
see a change [in]. I believe it can
be changed without requiring a
course for it. Just by
encouraging professors to assign
more oral reports, to teach more
in a discussion style, encourage
students to talk more in class, I
think great changes could be
made. That's something I would
see as a positive change if
anything, I would not like to see
a requirement that everyone take a
math course. I think science, if
you are going to take two or
three courses in each division, it
shouldn't make a difference
whether it's math or science. I
have a hard time convincing

myself that [have aplace in life .

to say that anyone should take

these two or three courses, at
least two or three courses. But I
have an even harder time saying
that everyone should take this
one particular course. Whereas
there should be some guidelines,
the guidelines should be as open
as possible. Well, I guess I
would not be opposed to a
physical-education requirement.
SomeLhing very liberal, or loose,
where even a student who goes
out every day, or goes out three

' times a week and jogs alone, can

satisfy that requirement as an
independent. I don't expect
everyone to run over to the PEC
and take racquetball and tennis
and swimming or something of
that sort, but I think it's good for
all students to do something,
some kind of physical activity.
If they're capable, Lhen I think it
would be good. It‘s just a way of
getting out of the academics, a
postitivc way of getting out of
the academics. Once again, I
have a hard time telling people
who hate to go out and exercise
that they should exercise, that
they have to exercise, but it‘s
something I would think . . . was
important, And it's also like, in
as I guess the Viccrpresident.
anything that I believe in, I
would suggest to the student
body, but I would not present as
a student body opinion unless the
student body voted that as an

opinion, as a majority opinion.’

So even if I wanted a physical-
education requirement, and the
student body rejected it. disagreed
with me, I would not suggest
that to the faculty or the
administration.

Matt Moreland

I'm a tour guide and I deal
with lots of prospective students
coming in and looking at this
school. And so many times,
their main pull here, besides
other things, they look at the
way we don't have a core
curriculum, their freedom to mix
up classes how they want, take
what they want, and not be
pinned down. I don't see ini-
tiating a core curriculum as being
a good thing. I don't'think it
should happen. I hope that when

the review is ﬁnished, they decide
that we‘re fine and nothing needs
to be changed. However, if it
comes to a point that they think
we do need to be changed, I will
ﬁght to keep it the same, but ifl
do have to compromise, I think
I'll be able to do it on way that
I'll still be able to keep our
students' but interests and
hopefully not have to
compromise at all.

Alanna Tyler

I have a couple of things that
I'd like to see done that would
affcct the curriculum. I'd like to
see something done with the
tutorials, which is one of the
suggestions that came from the
Student Council on Curriculum.
I think that, first of all, there
needs to be a better process of
evaluating the tutorials in terms
of what skills the students are
actually taking away from them,
and there needs to be something
done about standardizing the
turorials. When I was a fresh-
man, l learned writing in my
tutorial. whereas a friend who
was in another tutorial learned
test-taking. There needs to be
some work done on making sure
that the tutorial experience is the
same for every student. I'd also
like to Six: a curriculum where it's
possible to have a gender-studies
concentration or a black-studies
concentration or whatever. That
means that we need to have
faculty that have those kinds of
backgrounds. Apart from those
two things, maybe we could
change a few of the intro-level,
sort of hardcore science classes so
that Joe Student wouldn't be so
terriﬁed of math or chemistry or
biology. Those three things:
standardizing the tutorials, hiring
faculty with backgrounds that
would allow for concentrations,
and maybe having more intro-
levcl courses that are manageable
and aren‘t as frightening to
students who have shied away
from the sciences. Those are the
things that I would hope the
faculty would come up with
themselves, but'if not I would
call upon them to consider those.

what happened. Knowing what‘s
coming up, what’s going to be
happening at a meeting, and
being able to voice their opinions
to their senator, if not bcing able
to find the vice-president or
president and talking with them
directly. I feel lhatl should be
just as Open to having an opinion
voiced to me as a senator [is].

I don't think SGA is taken
seriously enough. A lot of times
it's people who are looking for rt
future in politics who run for
SGA or become involved with
SGA, who are sometimes elitists
within their own little group.
And it shouldn't be viewed that
way because once again it‘s the
students’ government. It needs to
be taken a little more seriously.
The large amounts of money we
deal with and the important
things that happen that affect

students, they‘re your livellhood
at Grinnell.

Alanna Tyler

I think the greatest problem
with SGA is that a lot of
students still don't feel that they
can impact decisions that are
being made at Grinncll through
SGA. I don‘t think they realize
that it is a mechanism for ex~
pressions of discontent or
whatever on campus. Things
like the open forums and
definitely the handbook project
have done a lot for introducing
students to what SGA is all
about, but still I don't think there
is a real feeling of ownership. I
don’t think students feel that they
own SGA, I see that as the
greatest problem. ‘

If you do not win the election, what are

your plans for next year?

Jeffl' Fields

Ifl don't win, I will be a hall
activities coordinator again. I will
hopefully be on my EPCithere
will be an election again for
thatgand hopefully be on
Curriculum Council, and again in
Curriculum Committee. I like
the committees I'm on, so ba-
sically [next] year will look like
this year. Except for I'll know
what I’m doing at the very
beginning, and I'll be into it.

' Whether I win the election or

not, I see myself playing a very
big part, a big picture, in cur-
ricular issues next year, just from
the experience I’ve gained this
year.

Matt Moreland

I'm taking a heavy enough
class load that it‘s going to keep
me busy. I may also apply for
the Cabinet position of all-
campus-events coordinator. I
worked in Security for the past
two years and it‘s been mentioned
to me that I should apply for
that, so I may do that.

Alanna Tyler
If I‘m not the vice-president

of SGA next year, I am still
going to work with a particular
curriculum issue, and that is
increasing the number of ethnic
and minority faculty on campus.
That was something that I decided
was really important last year.
One way to achieve that would
have been to be vice—president.
But if I'm not vice-president I‘m
still going to make sure that I
have the ear of whoever is vice-
prcsident and try to get some '
things going on campus so that
we work to change that. Gt‘innell
would be a much better
institution if there were more
minority faculty on campus and
that‘s something that I really
want to work toward. I think
that from the student side, there‘s
so much that we haven‘t done yet
so that’s what I would spend a lot
of time doing, in addition to the
normal senior stuff like trying to
get into graduate school and other
projects. I'm also very concerned
with recruitment of minority
students and I would work on
that.

Why did you decide to run for VP this

year?

Matt Moreland

I've decided not to be a
student adviser again. I’ve been a
student adviser, I've been on the
floors, and people are always
voicing thing to me. I see this
as a possible next step. I can go
a little bit farther. Rather than
just sitting back, being apathetic,
and saying, "They should be

, doing something," I ﬁnally got

my butt in gear to do something
and decided on it. I'm very happy
I got this far, just writing a letter
of intent and getting to this
point, but I want to go through
[with it]. I‘m just so proud of
myself for doing that, finally
getting in gear and going forward
and doing it, because I think I can

do a good job. It‘s going to boa

very lime-consuming deal, and

right here, at this time of the
semester, to go through all this,
and I'm also working on Student
Staff Selection Committee, it’s
keeping me busy with many
meetings, it’s just a matter of
ﬁnally breaking away and saying,
"I've got to do it," because
there’s not going to be a next
year. So it was a matter of
progression through Grinnell,
working as student adviser, and
that‘s working with students,
representing students and making
sure students are happy and
everything is going well with
them. This is the next, bigger,
broader step to a more overall
view. I’m focusing more on
academics now, but yet for the
students, letting them express
their vtews to me.
