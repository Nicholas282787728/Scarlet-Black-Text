Who chooses our tunes?

by Barry Eiiuurils

This semester's parties and
dances have lacked the usual
i'ocllsasbilly hands to which. in the
past. we have grown accustomed
Concert co»chall'pellple. Susan
Groves and Mike tiniiiaii. explaur
ed the change in two ways. The
concert selectors attempt to
choose bands which people will
like. and they try to introduce the
campus to newer and diiiereiit
types or music.

Oxman and Graves attempt to
select bands which the students
will enjoy. Grove explained. . .
no matter what we get.
somebody's going to hate it.”
However. “We [try] to satisfy
everybody at least once," Groves
Continued, This goal is achieved
through attempting to honor re
quests irom people hosting par
ties. When such a request is
received. Uxman or Groves con
tacts Georgia Dentel who. Groves
stated. works miracles in contaca
ting various bands.

Another major concern tor the
carchairpeople is educating the
campus. Because many students
do not have much chance to hear
avantrgarde or new artists. the
concert Committee attempts to br-
ing such music to campus. Oxman

hopes that introducing bands to
the campus community will
broaden the perspectives ot the
campus musical taste.

But. the job oi concort cos
chairperson does not only include
theoretical hopes ol broadening
the minds ()1 1.200 students.
Groves and oxmall explained that
arranging for an evening oi tunes
involves logistical conipleiritics
which are seldom appreciated.

Among the more obvious
obstacles which Graves and Ox»
man iace is that oi money. The
Student Government Association
supplies the money tor concerts
through the Student Activity
Fund. Unfortunately, Groves exe
plains. many popular bands are
very’cxpenswe and cannot be air
forded.

This problem is complicated by
the fact that more concert
demands have been placed on the
chairpeople than previously ex-
pected. One of these demands is to
supply a band ior a party hosted
by Haines dorm. Since the Alice in
Wonderland party, traditionally
sponsored by Haines. was arrang-
ed by others.

Groves and Oxman are also fac-
ed with the challenge of fulﬁlling
the band members' yearnings. In

‘The way we live now’

by Kevin McKeougli

This Sunday. America will
regain one oi its most precious
pieces oi lost cultural heritage.
“Doonesbury". Garry Trudeau's
Pulitzer Prizewinning. internar
tionally-syndicated comic strip
will return to iine iamily
newspapers throughout the counr
try. Which is to say it won't be ap~
pearing in the “Scarlet and
Black". or “The Outcry". ior that
matter.

Come Sunday morning, millions
oi Americans oi all political
ideologies. economic classes and
cultural eccentricties will bypass
irontrpage reports oi the us.
Marines invasion oi Newark. as
an in-depth interview with “Huey
Lewis: The New Dylan7”. Ryne
Sandbert's nude pin-up. and a
iascinating business report on
new trends in the soup industry.
Ozzie. Harriet, Dick and
Amazonia will turn immediately
to the exploits oi Zonker l-larris.
Joanie Caucus and Rick Redfern.

its arrival comes at one oi the
lowest points in our once-great na»
tion‘s history, a time of grave
uncertainty and tear. There can
be no doubt about it, the state of
the American comic strip is
perilous

Consider the choices attorted
the loyal reader of Grinnell's local
paper, The Des Moines Register.
At best. nine oi the comics page's
twentyeone strips will produce a
chuckle on a given morning, and
that's including “Annie". which

ttechnicallyi is a dramatic strip
”Dennis The Menace" otters a

Track” lets us know what to ex-
pect in the years to come.
"Kudzu". having linally dispens
ed with that “noon pie" malarkey
managed to be honestly amusing
once. . in a while. "Peanuts" is
like y ur greatrgrandfather:
You've become too used to his
presence to get rid oi him. but you
can't help suspect he's dead
already. "Shoe" and “B C.” are
adequate. but “Guidon” and
"Bloom County" alone show us
the world as it is in all its weird-
ness.

Having exhausted these nine.
your archetypal word-balloon
freak is left to contend with the
likes of ”For Better or Worse".
”Blondie" and “The Family Cir-
cle", which makes the "Br dy
Bunch” look like Eugene O'Neil.
"Marmaduke" and “Garfield"
are compelling arguments ior
abolition of the Humane Society.
Has any living human being every
read “Judge Parker" or “Rex
Morgan. MD"? “Benchley” has
taken all the humor out of the
Reagan Administration. a task
which previously seemed impossi-
ble. “Crock" , . .speaks for itself.

The greatest disappointment.
though, is “SpideraMan”. Once
upon a time, Peter Parker battled
really ierocious superhoods like
Dr. Octupus and the Lizard. Now
we must content ourselves with
twcrbit hoods, international Kerr
rorists. and Parker's Aunt May. a
pathetic old bag who makes
euthanasia seem like a pretty
good idea.

addition to the usulil contract.
each band provides its personal
“rider" which accompanies the
contract The rider cssentially is a
list of items and services which
the bands require.

Among the usual list oi requests
are motel reservations. food. and
directions to the liquor store. ac
cording to Uxman, Groves coma
plains that she spent much oi the
last concert, by the Art Ensemble
oi Chicago. searching ior towels
[or the band to use during the in-
termission.

Many oi iirst semester's bands
have already been selected. Chris
Fousek. an intended concert c0-
chair person who resigned his
position. arranged most at the
pre-Christmas hands during the
summer. Groves expects that she
and Oxman will begin preparing a
list of second semester's concerts
within a few weeks.

The list representing the re
mainder oi the semester is:

High Noon tUnited ArtisLs/Stanley Kramer 19527 is a four star
western starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly.

Gary Cooper portrays a marshal who learns, on his wedding day, that
outlaws intend to terrorize his town. Cooper is iorced to lace the bandits
without the help oi the townspeople because they are airaid to deiend
themselves. His only support comes irom his wiie terace Kelly). a
Quaker. who strongly opposes violence.

Much oi nigh Noon's success is attributed to the film’s editor. The
story takes place in a iew hours. masteriully indicated by irequent
glimpses oi the clock. The theme song. “Do Not Forsake Me. Oh My
Darling”. sung by Tex Bitter. helps to provide continuity to the film.

The editor also did an excellent job with the shots oi Cooper. The actor
was very ill during the iilming oi nigh Nonn. Most oi Cooper's grimac-
ing and watery eyes wre not good acting. but. rather. a result oi severe
physical pain.

nigh Noon gave Gary Cooper his second Academy Award and was a
tremendous comeback tor the iading star. The iilm was also the iirst
signiticant leading role ior Grace Kelly. nigh Noon is one oi the best
westerns made, and it is certainly a classic worth seeing

High Noon will be shown on Saturday. Sept. 2!). at 10:10 ill AR“ and on
Sunday. Sept. 30. at 9:410 in the South Lounge.

Blade Runner

by M. Leviis

Blade Runner. starring Harrison Ford. is part oi the ”Visions oi the
Future” film series. The film is loosely based upon the novel Do All-
droids Dreaui oi Electric Sheep?.

in the movie. Ford plays a “blade runner.” a type oi bounty hunter
who hunts ‘replicants'. neplicants are superior androids that are barely
distinguishable from humans. Replicants are not allowed on Earth.
when a group oi replicants illegally comes to Earth. it is Ford's job to
‘terminate' them. Blade Runner explores the moral implications 0!: kill-
ing the replicants, and Ford's disillusionment with society.

In this movie. however. style is more important than plot. Blade Rim-
nei- is stylistically excellent. Terriiic photography. odd camera angles.
and unusual, dark lighting are all employed in an eiiort to portray a
grim and depressing iuture society. it is a luture society heavily in
iiuenced by Japanese culture A market scene, toward the beginning oi
the iilm. depicts a society in which people light with one another in a
contusing babble oi languages. it is a society in which electric replicas
of animals are expensive. and real animals almost impossible to get.

Blade Runner is not a cheeriui movte. but it is certainly worth seeing,
if only for the striking visual effects. It is a science fiction movie that
depends upon scenery. lighting and photography to convey a sense ol
iuture. not upon showy special eiiects.

There is quite a bit of violence in the movie. some of it quite disturbs
ing. However. it is not gratuitous violence, but an essential element of
the plot. There are some interesting twists to the plot. including two
unusual love stories. Blade Runner is a fascinating and disturbing ims
age or the iuture.

Blade Runner will be shown Friday, Sepl. 28 at 9:30 in Ali". and Sun-
day. Sept. 30 al trim in South Lounge. .
