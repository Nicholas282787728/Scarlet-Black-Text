Grinnell Attacks
Advertising Thursday
Night in A. R. H.

A very small group of people at»
tended the debate last Thursday eve»
ning between Griunell and Iowa
state college in the auditorium of
the A R, H. The question under
discussion was that of advertising:
“Resolved, that modern advertising
as practiced in the United States to-
day is more harmful than beneficial
to society."

Grinnell upheld the affirmative of
the argument with Paul Klinefclter.
Jonathan Danforth, and Howard
McIli-oth speaking, Members of the
Iowa State squad were Roy Holm-
bcrg, Joseph Caputo. and Wayne
Birchard. They argued the negative
on the question.

The affirmative maintained that
the present trends in advertising are
detrimental to its usefulness: that
the principles of advertising have
been misunderstood and abused
through exaggeration, iintruthful-
ness. and the paid testimonial. They
suggested as a remedy the Federal
Trade commission which is beginning
to restrict advertising, though this is
:not within the realm of its power.

Defend Advertising

The negative stated that wealth
and prosperity of the United States
is due to advertising because through
advertising the mass production
which characterizes the present
economic system is possible, Meni-
bers of the negative also pointed
out that advertising as it is prac-
ticed today is educational through
its radio broadcasting and through
its printed forms. and that it helps
make possible the large and good
magazines and papers which are
printed in the United states.

No dcci on was given on the lies
'bate. It was again the popular
(opinion of the audience that the
Grinnell team had outpointed their
:rivals.

Robert Blasier'acted as chairman
of the debate.

Steiner Speaks at ,
Y. W. C. A. Meeting

“The real ﬁeld for women interest-
ed in the theater lies either in the
college, the high school. or the
Church," said. Miss Gretchen Steiner
in her talk before the Y.W.C.A.. last
Thursday evening. Miss Steiner,
who for four years has been the
director of the Niagara Falls com-
munity theater and has had exten-
sive experience both in acting and
directing, spoke on “The Theater as
a Vacation.“ She reviewed the
dramatic ﬁeld and told of her own
efforts to ﬁnd a job on Broadway.

nrti es which the Scnrlct and

campus groups dcalt with. In a
recent issue tlic Men's Forensic
and “‘alnen's Forensic were 01"

up Sigma Delta Chi and Tlicta
Sigma Phi.

Sigma Delta Chi: The Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi was es;
tablished shortly after the war, and
has made constant efforts towards
the recognition of journalism in its
highest significance here in Grinnell.

Sigma Delta Chi is a national jour-
nalistic fraternity, and is the only
professional fraternity for men on
the Grinnell campus. Its member-
ship is made up of those juniors,
seniors and secondrsemester sopho-
mores who have done outstanding
journalistic work during their college
years and who intend to follow jour-
nalism as a profession when they are
graduated.

The fraternity takes an active
part in all campus activities. and
each year sponsors the Pioneer Prud-
ities, which will be presented March
7, and the Brown Derby Drag. The
chapter publishes the Malteaser,
campus humor publication, and as—
sists in managng the Iowa High
School Press association. The chap»
ter sends two representatives each
year to the national convention at
which it was commended last fall for
its efficiency.

Theta Sigma Phi: This organiza-
tion is to the women of Grinnell
what Sigma Delta Chi is to the men.
a national jaurnalistic fraternity for
women. According to its uonstitu»
tion it seeks to make definite con-
tribution to the cause of journalism
and to assist its members to real
achievement in the field of letters.

Members are selected from those
who have done outstanding work on
campus publications by the existing
membership each spring and fall. Its
membership includes several nation»
ally known journalists.

Each year it assists Sigma Delta
Chi in entertaining the annual can»
vention of the Iowa High School
Press association, gives a tea for all
women interested in journalism, and
cooperates with the men in giving a
banquet for all new students who are
interested in journalistic work. For
its bi-weekly meetings it brings to
Grinnell many speakers who have
had active experience in newspaper
and magazine work.

Grinnell students and faculty will
be interested in music activities of

Suffering Severely from the loss of

who is out of the game with a broken

the playing ability of Dayton Williams

The smooth team work that the flir-

evident in the second game of the“
Arkansas series. .
Neither the Aggies nor the Sooners'
