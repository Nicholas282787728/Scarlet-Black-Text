Dibble, ”Smith
Lead Poloists

Defeat Rawson, Crates Halls
in Scclring Sprees

Saturday

Smith and Dibble. favorites for the
intramural water polo championship,
remained undefeated Saturday by
virtue of respective victories over
Gates and Rawson. With Risscr lead-
ing the attack for Smith with five
touch goals and four frcc throws, the
1931 runners-up swamped the ins
experienced Gates sextet 39 to 11.
Risser’s scoring splurge gives him the
lead in individual scoring.

Even more devastating was the
Dibble victory over Rawson by the
impressive score of 54 to 5, breaking
the pool record which was set Wed—
nesday night by the former team.

The game was not devoid of its
spectacular features, however, for
the brilliant work of Canavan [or
Rawson stayed off several poten-
ﬁal goals. Bob Morgan, giant Dibble
forward, and Dave Malbrough, crack
freshman swimmer, each accounted
for 15 points. Chuck Woody of
Rawson caught the Dibble goalakeelr
er unaware to score the first thrown
goal in two years.

Langan defeated Clark in the other
game, scoring 22 points in the last
half to overcome the 7-0 lead Clark
held at the half. Clark was held
scoreless in the final period. Sutton
scored 16 points for the winners,
while Wesley Clark accounted for all
of the losing team's points.

The games scheduled for Tuesday
evening were postponed until tonight
because of a conflict with the piano
recital. Gates will play Clark at s
p. 21,. and Rawson will meet Langan
immediately following The schedule
of games for Thursday evening is as
follows‘ Dibble vs Langan, 9
o'clock; Smith vs. Clark, 9:30; Raw~
son vs. Gates, 10 p. m.

Coed readers, if a man called you
up for a date at 7:30 in the evening,
would you go” This was a question
asked by an inquiring reporter at
Ohio university when she interviewed
several coeds on the campus. The
general response seemed to he that
it till depended on the man and where
he was going. One coed said it de—
pended on the MAN, the MOOD, and
the MOON.7Indiana Daily student.

“I'm Floyd K. Riley. a speech in-
structor," was not enough of a Ian‘-
tering ram to enable that ind Jidual
to get into Winston Churchill‘s room
at the auditorium where he addressed
a University of Michigan student
gathering last week.

”I'n‘l an instructor in speech. and I
would like to come in if you don't
mind." Riley repeated about the third
time the doorman shoved him aside.
“I do mind," the guardian said, hows
ever, and the door banged in Riley's
face again. He was even more diSA
comfitted, though, when a full ac'
count of the incident appeared in the
student newspaper the next morning.

Professors at Michigan State col-

students on the campus when they
were questioned by a reporter
“What instructor on the campus do
you like the least?"

A 10 per cent reduction in Yale
budget to counteract an anticipated
deficit of $500,000 was effected this

the amount by which the budget will
fall short. All departments are ask-
ed to make a 10 per cent reduction in
their budgets. President Angeli re~
ports that thle has had a 300 per
cent increase in students seeking fin-

Little Mike Pilbmw and the Crin-
,nell college mile-relay team virtually
rule the Criminal! campus after their
meritorious efforts in the Central Iiie
tercollegiale meet at Notre Dame‘
last Saturday. Pllbrow scored an as—
tounding victory over one of the nae
tion's greatest distance runners, Clark
Chamberlain of Michigan state, and
ltnereby ranks as a leading candidate
for a position on the Olympic team.
‘The mile-relay quartet forced Notre
Dame to establish a. new conference
‘record, and finished only twortenths
of a second behind.
. a s
Clark Chamberlain's latest exploit
was to establish a new world's record l
in the national A. A. U. cross-country‘
meet at Ypsilanti, Mich. recently. His‘
itime of 9:131 was the fastest two—
mile outdoor mark turned in by any-
. ‘college runner in 1931. For Pilbmw,l
Grinllell’s star, to defeat a man who
has the alarming distinction of hav-
ing broken 11 records in the last 13
‘races he has run, is a remarkable
feat.
