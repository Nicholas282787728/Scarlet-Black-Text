How to capture London in a souvenir

Like all procrastinators. I find that turns
. ing the Calendar to December can be a
nerve-wracking experience. it is always
dismaying to discover that the semester is
almost over and i am totally unprepared

A more immediate problem IS shopping

gills extremely tacky, they have little or
nothing to do with London itsell.

For. as much as l complain about the
abundance or queues and the lack oi
modern plumbing. i have enjoyed being in
London. and I think it deserves something
more than a T-shirl.

I value my friends too
much to inflict them
with acrylic socks
printed with the

British flag.

Like any major metropolis, London can
be seen through the museums. the
theatres. the huge parks. the cathedrals
and castles. but in order [or a Christmas
present to really represent London. it
would have to include a lot or little things.
also. the idiosyncrasies that distinguish
London trom New York or Chicago.

Some ot these little things are simply
phrases that belong wholly to London.

“Way Out" is certainly one, as is the tube
train driver's cautionary “Mind the doors,
please” as the train prepares to leave me
station. i didn’t mind the doors much at
tirst. but i learned to as the semester went
on.

My iavoritc is the BrltRail conductor's
announcement to a train full or sleepy
passengers as it pulls into the station late
at night: “We are now approaching Lone

From St. Lucy to St. Nick
Christmas is International

by Todd Francis

Christmas traditions in Western Euro-
pean nations like Switzerland, Spain.
France, and Sweden. share many
characteristics with those of the United
States. But. at the same time, native
customs make Christmas in each country
its own unique experience. Four interna
tional students share what is special about
their Christmases.

There are two Santa Clauses, They Came
on the Sixth of December. one wearing red,
the other black. The red one brings
chocolate. oranges, hum, and presents to
good children, But the black one loads
naughty children into his big bag. and
hauls them into the woods, where they
have to work [or the next year, The set-
ting? Christmaslimc in Switzerland!

In Switzerland. everyone uses real
Christmas trees, explained Karin Leupp.
the German language assistant. Lit
candles. balls. bells, angel hair, a star on
top, and or course Swiss chocolate
decorate the trees.

The day belore Christmas is usually a
day tor the lamily to be together. Families
sing songs and read stories. That evening
the Christmas child (usually described as
a young girl with long hair) enters each
house through the window and leaves
presents, As she leaves, she lights the
candles and rings the bells on the tree

The lollowing day. tamilies generally
get together with relatives to celebrate the
holiday of the Christmas season. savs

Christmas in Sweden, too. is very come
mercialized. Aggie Rysinka describes the
Christmas celebration as a combination of
traditional Swedish customs and more re
cent Christian practices.

Early in the Christmas season comes me
celebration of St. Lucy’s Holiday, On
December 13, people dress in white and
wear candles on their heads to represent
the image of St, Lucy. Although there is no
vacation from work- or school. the day is
spent “goofing off."

Counting down the days to Christmas is
practiced by old and young alike in
Sweden. Each week, beginning tour weeks
before Christmas, a candle is lit to
celebrate the advent of Christ. Further.
each child has a calendar with windows,
The child opens one wmdow each day lrom
December first to Christmas.

A tree with decorations adds Christmas
spirit to the house. while a star shines out
through a nearby window On Christmas
Eve. dinner traditionally includes ham.
oranges. nuts. and oatmeal. Hidden in the
oatmeal is an almond. The person who
ﬁnds it is predicted to marry during the
forthcoming year.

Santa Claus comes late Christmas Eve.
accompanied by gnomes that originated in
the traditional pre-Christian Swedish
religion. Children leave the gnomes loud

In France. Christmas is largley a social
event. Gillaume Bourrier, the French
language assistant. emphasizes that the
main focus of the holiday is in seeing

triends and relatives, Christmas is more
tamily-oriented, while New Years' Eve
and New Year's Day typically involve
larger parties.

On Christmas Eve, tamilies usually get
together tor an elegant least that might in»
clude snails and salmon or other types or
ﬁsh. At noon on the twenty-tourth. Pere
Noel brings presents for children.
Christmas Day is a day tor visiting others.

in contrast to the generally secular
Christmas holidays of Switzerland,
Sweden and France. celebrations in Spain
center on religious aspects or the season.
According to Enrique Menor. homes in
Spain usually have a nativity scene
beneath the traditional Christmas tree.

Celebrating
Freedom from
Oppressmn

by Janet Silverstein
Chanukah. Hanukah. or l-lannukah
tthere are probably a million ways to spell
it) all reler to the Jewish Festival or
Lights. However one chooses to spell it. the
word means “dedication" and relers to the
rededication ot the Temple to the service
of God after it had been ”deﬁled with
pagan images and practices" in 165 B,C
The testival commemorates the victory
ol the Maccabians after an uprising
against the Assyriancreek regime and

three years. The regime had tried to
’ restrict Jewish religious practices and

, values By the end oi the struggle, the
33» Maccabees had recaptured the Temple or

Jerusalem and its traditional Jewish 1-,
vice was restored. Jewish political
sovereignty over the land was also
restored.

Thereloi-e. on Chanukah one celebrates
lreedom lrom this oppression, One also
lcels especially gratelul tor God’s
miracles For during that time period.
Assyrians stole all ol the oil in the Temple

temple burning. There wasn't even enough
oil to lasthne day. However. a great
miracle happened and the oil lasted tor
eight days. when they wereﬁnally able to
get some more oil.

In memory of this. one lights an eight-
branched candelabrum called a menorah
for each of the eight nights 01‘ Chanukah.
Blessings are said over the candles and
Chanukah songs are otten sung by the en-
tire tamily.

The first night one lights one candle, the
second one lights two. and this continues
until the eighth night when the whole
menorah is lighted, One extra "service'
candle tcalled the ”shamas" in Hebrew) is
used to light all other candles and also is
the candle which can be borrowed from the
menorah to use for light.

Traditionally. parents give children one
present each night at Chanukah. and some
children do the same for their parents.

Playing the dreidel game is one tradition
during Chanukah time, A dreidel is a small
top which has a letter of the Hebrew
alphabet on each of its sides The letters
represent the Hebrew words which
translate into the English sentence: A
