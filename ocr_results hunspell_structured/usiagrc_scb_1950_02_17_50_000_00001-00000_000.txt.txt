Sultana Coca Pavlovitch, most rec
here, in an interview, “I have a li
terms, For instance, “loggia” mean
ish."

Despite superficial difficultiest
Coca, as she prefers to he calls
ed, says she is getting along
very well. “I certainly likel
Grinnell better than the build-‘
ing in East Boston where l was»
interned for thrcc months.” she!
exclaimed. '

Unsure of status

Coca isn’t quite sure what
her status in Grinnell is. She
had completed two years at the
American college in Turkey, but
her credits haven’t arrived, so
she is listed by the college as
an unclassified student. She lives
off campus with Mrs. Adeline
Pruyn.

“There is quite a difference
between the social life here and
in Turkey,” she stated. ”We did
not have what you would call
dates. We went around as a
crowd and did everything with
the group We did have dances,
though, and went to those as
couples sometimes." '

Coca is planning on maiore
ing in science, as she wants to
become a surgeon. “I don’t know
if I can do it,” she said. ”but
I'm going to try."

Chapel Will Give

Music Program
. From Scripture

“The program of this music
chapel is prepared to show how
different composers treated cer-
tain scriptural selections,” Miss
Sarah Hornung, (Music) an.
nounced last Thursday. This
will be the monthly music
chapel for February, and will
be held in Herrick chapel at
10:00 a. in. next Thursday.

“All the music which is be-
ing performed was inspired by
scripture passages,” Miss Hor—
nung continued. Dr. Sherman
will read the scripture and then
the music about them will be
given by Mr. Johnk the college
organist, and myself."

Prelude by Marcello

Mr. Johnk will play as pre—
lude “The Heavens Declare the
Glory of God" by Marcello.
Then Dr. Sherman will read
Psalm 19 from which this title
is taken. Miss Hornung will
sing “I Will Lift up my Eyes
Unto the Hills" by Stoughton
followed by Psalm 121.

The program will conclude
with ”The Lord is my Shepherd"
by Van de Water, Psalm 23, and
an organ postlude “Hear Oh
lsrea" by Weinberger followed
by Mark 12.

Air Attack Fails
On Playful Males
Union? Sales!

Snow flew in a battle royal
on central campus Wednesday
night. Snow filled the air, hair,
eyes, and clothes as north Camv
pus tried to outsdrub south
campus representatives.

The men assembled at 8:30 at
Cowles, marching past ARH to
Loose hall, accompanied by a
drum and bugle corps. Their
plan of attack was to march up
and down the loggia challenging
women to a battle. The weaker
sex, meanwhile, had cached
snowballs on the sun deck for
bombardment of the men. Hand-
tnrhand combat ensued below
when ammunition gave out.

A song fest in the union and
hot chocolate followed, From
there the crowd walked to Dean
Strong’s home to serenade him
on his birthday.
