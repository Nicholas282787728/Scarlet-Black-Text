Freshmen Lead

in Track Meet

Grinnell High Athletes
Trail 52 to 17 at End
of Track Events.

Grinnell college freshmen had no
difficulty in piling up a commanding
lead in the first day's events of a
two-day dual meet with the Grinnell
high school, compiling a total of
fifty-two points against the Seven—
tccn for the prep school. The field
events will he run off today and from
all indications the Scarlet and Black
pol-formers should continue to pile up
a lead.

The frosh squad took first in every
event except the 220~yard hurdles,
when Pat Gallagher of Coach Star-
buck's team nosed out the freshman
runner. One of the most interesting
races of the meet was the one-mile
run. As was expected, Arthur Mc-
Ilrath and Myron Pilbrow fought
each other for the lead throughout
the three laps, with the diminutive
Pilbrow staging a brilliant sprint on
the final lap to come in first.

The two most outstanding men for
the firsteyeer men were Captain
Pojman and Alexander. Alexander
surprised the fans when he beat out
Pojman in the hundredyard dash,
but Pojman came back to take a
first in the 220. 'Alexander also cop-
ped the quarter-mile and ran anchor
on the mile-relay team.

To the Editor
Black:
Grinnell college is noted for her
ideals. Her ideals are supposed to
be above the average maintained by
mankind as a whole. They are per-
petuated and made a part of the stu-
dent’s life by the college traditions,
Grinnell has many traditions of beau-
ty and purpose which represent to
the student body a goal to he striven
after and serve to make them love
her more.

of The Scarlet and

Last year there was a tradition to

the effect that between the hours of,

eight in the morning and nine in the
evening there should be no smoking
on the campus properitbat is the
territory south and west of Eighth
avenue and the M, 8: St. L. tracks.
The tradition was seldom violated
and did not seem to be much of an
incumbrance on the student body. If
a person wished to smoke he mere-
ly went across the street. This year
the tradition is not in effect. Fresh-
men do not seem even to have heard
of it and most students smoke when
and where they please.

The loss of this tradition is a rath-
er detrimental matter to the college.
Visitors receive a very poor impres«
sion when they see students smoking
just outside the buildings which bar-
bor their classes. in several in-
stances visitors have been actually
disappointed by this. for they had
heard much of GrinneII'S ideals in
regard to her campus.

The campus is dear to the heart
of every Grinnellian and anything
which serves to reduce its dignity or
beauty is a thing which should be
done away with. Smoking seems to
do this. Since we obey many of her
traditions which seem purposeiess
why cannot we observe this one also
which has the values of age, pur
pose, and reasonableness.

the production of the play was a con-
iirmation of this idea. "The Law,"
as an impressionistic portrayal of
the idea that love is higher than law.
fell short of being convincing in a
number of places. The actors all did
well. but they had difficult parts,
and the play gave the impression, on
the whole, that the emotionally in»
tense scene which they enacted was
not sufficiently prepared for. It was
rather difficult to get into the mood
of the play.

The writing and production of the
plays, done under the direction of
Mrs, Sara Sherman Pryor, was a
part of the work of the Experiment-
al theater, composed or the college
playwriting and play-production
classes. Over forty students took
part in the production of the three
plays this year.
