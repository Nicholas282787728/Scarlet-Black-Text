TOE DANCER CY“

At campus hops, Cy guards the wall.
Why, he doesn’t l‘mow at all.

Cy thinks he’s really quite a prancer—

In point of fact, a real toe dancer. ((
But, as every wise girl knows, .4
He doesn't dance on his own toes!

fastest pitcher in the league.
The Gatesmen lost their whole
infield, so they must go along
with “rookies“. They must find
some muchcneeded hitting help,
too. ' ‘

North looks real tough this
year. They have strong-armed
Quimby Day pitching, hotter
than average hitting, and a lot
oi experience. Up to this date
they have a 2-0 record.

Clark could turn into a pow.
er, as they showed iby beating
Gates Tuesday. Jay Botvinick
pitched a sterling one—hitter.
Smith and South both have
tough hitting but must find
pitching somewhere.

Cowles looks like the choice
for the crown—if there is any
choice. They have a top dc-
fciisive infield and outfield
and little John Wallace. “Wall"
is one of the league’s top pit-
chers and is also a terror at
the plate. He hit close to .500
last year.

it looks like a tough race this
year and will get tighter as the
season progresses. The softball
title could be the key to the Ken
trophy. ,

the Pioneers lost to Knox, 154),

ever, the greens are still a
“bit slow."
