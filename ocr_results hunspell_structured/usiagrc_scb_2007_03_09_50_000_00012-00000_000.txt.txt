Rosenfield didn't like the food either

These days, the name Joe Rosenfield ’25 is
a household name on Grinncll's campus. But
how much do we know about him? Rosenﬁeld
penned a eoncerned letter to the editor in the
March 11,1977 issue otthe sell? shedding light
on his own experiences at this college and his
vision {or its funiriz.

No more Gates ﬁnes, please

we love self—governance, and we like panics
too. However, last semester we had an obnoxious
list of hall fees for our lounge in Gates, and all
51,005 ofit is a result of damage done in our

- kitchen and lounge. Don't trash out spree. Gates

doesn’t want to pay for any more unreserved par-

. ties this semester, As a hall, we don’t want to shut

down Gates Lounge for therast ofthe year. So,

please clean up or fess up or pay up:

Love,
Gates Residents ,

True soul underneath cold shell

Okay Grinncll, aka “a very politically involved
and environmentally progressive” college, it is
time that I see some ptoofofthati! SGA hasjust
formed a new committee, the Student Environr
mental Committee, and if you truly embody what
Grinnell used to be, and still' is to some Extent,
then come sit in on our open meetings, Sundays
at7: oo in jRC 311- A, or even a mail [sgasee] to
get on the agenda! Come on, 1 know beneath
that cold shell of academia, there' IS a thrashing
soul of an activist waiting to burst through UN!
'LEASH THE BEAST!

Disco collectors not respectful I

Ovez my two years at Grinncll,I could use slot or
terms to describe Grinnell students, but one’ term
that never comes to mind is rude. This week stun
dents collecting for Disco stopped by my room in
Smith Nobody in my room gave money, not a big
surprise, Smith is a sub free dorm We were sur-
prised when the students mocked us as they left the
ﬂoor. I have been to some parties while I have been
at Grinnell and have not consumed any EtOl—l, as

- have many other people I knew, and never once has

>anyone commented in a negative way about out be—
havlot Grinncll students, at least most of us, can
respect other peoples wishes to get or not to get

t drunk. Perhaps the students collecting for Disco

have some learning to do. -
