Les Duke course. There were so
many ninners that the Roos quickly
lost touch with each other and so
were not able to accomplish their
team goal ofpacking on the 5.1-mile
course.

True to form, Jonathan Lave, 4th,
led Todd Rowekamp. 8th,who had a
personal best of 26:30 (adjusted for
5 miles); Jeff Ulmer, loth; Dave
Sheridan, 23rd; and Mark Couch,
29th.

Due to the fact thatonly seven pree
designated runners scored, an urt~
usual situation arose. Jeff Ulrner,
who ran as a non»scorer, had a fan-
tastic race, yet he was not counted in
the final team standings, For this
reason, the team scores of Luther

By Steve Clem
and Mick Kulikowski

TheGrinnellCollegefootballteam
had the tables turned on it last week,
with Iowa Wesleyan defeating the
Pioneers 49-7. This was the first
defeat of the season for the Pioneers,
who now have a 2~I record.

“Wejustgotbeatbyabetterteam.
They controlled the game both of—
fensively and defensively,” coach
Greg Wallace said.

Gt-innell put together a successful

drive early in the game, leading to
the Pioneers’ only scorei a l-yard
touchdown run by freshman running
back Ted Stanleyt The scamper was
Stanley‘s fourth touchdown in three
games.

Things were looking good for the
Pioneers at the end of the ﬁrst quar-
ter, as they led 7-6 It was all Iowa
Wesleyan from there on out, how-
ever.

Capitalizing on Pioneer turnovers
and outstanding talent at the skill
positions, Iowa Wesleyan scored a
total of 7 touchdowns.

“We knew they were quick, but
we hoped to recover fumbles and
make interceptions. We couldn’t
make them make mistakes," Coach
Wallace said.

Iowa Wesleyan’s passing attack
was ﬂawless. “When a team throws
the ball that much without intercep-
tions, they’ve had a great game,”
Wallace said.

Tomorrow the Pioneers begin
conference play against Lawrence,
making the long trek to Appleton,
Wisc. Both teams ﬁnd themselves in
similiar situations, having to bounce
back after tough losses.A win would

For all you neophytes, rugby is a
cross between football and soccer,
but with its own distinctive rules.
Rugby is characterized by a decided
absence of pads and other protective
gear; there is also no blocking, no
forward passes and an utter disre—
gard for personal safety.

The match was blemished by
sporadic skirmishes between the
teams. This was largely thanks to
overzealous Newton rookies with
only a partial grasp of the rules and
but a passing regard for sportsman-
ship.

Grinnell highlights included a try

by Greg Beninger, with a well<
earned assistfrom MarkPilder. There
