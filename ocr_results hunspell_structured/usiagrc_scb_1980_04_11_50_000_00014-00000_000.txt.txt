-_Camiabis, a personal
mind-expander

In the 1960’s, back beiore Timothy
. Leary was a standrup comic or Ken

Kesey a silent hermit, there were,
among the drunkards and pleasure
seekers of the college campuses, a few
serious people who firmly believed in
the spiritual worth of drugrinduced Vic
sionsi In the enlightened 70's, of
course, everyone recognized that all
spirituality was mere selfrdelusion,
and this realization has freed today’s
college students to use drugs in a
spirit of absolute hedonism, In the
moralistic backlash that is sweeping
us into the 50’s, drugs are often seen
as one more dangerous symptom (or
cause) oi decadence, nothing more.
For those oi us who often rely on
drugs, and are not unhappy with that
state of affairs, the trend is troubling,

Marijuana, speciiically, is a very
good thing. It oiiers a unique perspec»
tive on our internal universes. In this
respect it resembles the much-
heralded positive aspects of LSD and
other hallucinogens, the unavailability
of high-quality specimens of which has
rendered them hopelessly unstylish.
Of course, there are those who deny
that drugs can ever alter for the bet-
ter the consciousness of a human be-
ing. There are even a few who have
used a drug such as mescaline and
still take that position. But on a per-
sonal level, I can only understand this
denial by concluding that i and they
have some basic psychological dii.
ferences that alter our responses to
drugs. For me, many drugs, and most
notably marijuana, radically redirect
the currents of my suul’s ocean for the
better, and with a minimum of pollu-
tion of my body.

at the typewriter. In general, cannabis
unlocks the barriers my mind erects
against itself. It lets me feel my highs
and my lows more deeply, more en-
tirely, and thus helps prevent the oc-
currence of unresolved emotional con-
flicts which can simmer within, It
clears my mind, not by wiping away
what lam, but by teaching me how to
arrange my mind with wide open core
ridors for learning and creating,
reciprocal processes which must use
the same mental avenues of com~
munication.

or course, there can be no denying
the harmful side effects of marijuana
and other drugs, including alcohol,
tobacco, coffee, and sugar. Physically,
marijuana pollutes the lungs, may
damage chromosomes, and probably
will turn out to cause cancer. Mental»
ly, it can dilute concentration or can
cause paranoia in varying degrees.
While I won't feel much of the
physical effect for at least a few more
years, the psychological effects are a
recurrent reality for me. I am no
stranger to paranoia; yet writing itself
is a mental aberration, indicating a
perception oi the inadequacy oi oral
communication. Certainly the same
lobommy could eliminate both
paranoia and the deSll‘e to write;
should we be too surprised if drugs
that promote one also promote the
other? I, for one, am neither surprised
nor discouraged. Without paranoia, I
fear, I could write myselt death. With
paranoia, I fear I could write myself
to death.

My final argument in favor of mari~
juana is a highly subjective and
disputable one, but it is one that I

“I am more aware than ever that I depend

upon these substances for assistance..3’

Unable as I am to witness the inner
workings of any mind other than my
own, I can make no generalized
claims about what marijuana can do
that is good. For me, it is a wellspring
of hope, creativity, and insight. Mari-
juana is, for example, highly valuable
to me as a Mamematics major; a few
pufis were a sure source of insight in-
to a diihcuit concept of Topology. A
largerrscale indulgence is the best
way 1 know to rid myseii of
psychological writer's cramps: After
weeks oi writing nothing at all, a good
high will often keep me up past dawn

know from discussions is widely
shared. Psychoactive drugs, i believe,
can activate cerLain aspects of the
mind that, in some people, lie dormant
for a lifetime. In other words, drugs
can, if properly used, afford genuine
spiritual insights into the nature and
meaning of human existence. Such
things as understanding math better
are just a side effect of these insights.
I would not go so far as to claim that
drugs offer the same fulfillment found
in mystical religious traditions, for I
do not believe this to be the case. But
every mystical tradition requires iirst

that an indiVidual be religiously
curious and alive, before he can begin
to unlock the secrets of existence. In a
society where religious orientation is
generally laughed at, drugs offer an
alternative mode of awakening. Ken
Kesey compared taking LSD to walk-
ing through a door: you can keep go-
ing through the same door time after
time, or you can begin to explore the
other side. He said this as a warning
to the ilower children against drug use
for its own sake, but today it stands
out more as a positive claim: Drugs
can open up many people’s minds to
view a world they have never before
imagined.

The warning, however, ought not to
be ignored. After ten years or drug
use, 1 am more aware than ever that I
depend upon these substances for
assistance in many creative and in-
tellectual endeavors that I should pro-
perly be able to do independently. It
does disturb me that I use marijuana
to enhance my enjoyment and apr
preciation of everything from Math to
Religious Studies, from programming
a Computer to singing a madrigal. Yet
still I wonder whether, without the
drug, my interests would have ranged
so widely, Certainly I know people
who live perpetually in a smokeiilled
haze and get nothing done, But I know
many more people who lead lives of
crystal clarity and sobriety, with no
idea of what should or even of what
could be done. I have chosen to try to
return into the haze exactly often
enough to clarify the goals and mean-
ing of the rest of my existence. This is
an endless tightrope over an abyss,
but having come thus far it would be
no safer to turn back. The patterns of
my thoughts are by now themselves
psychedelic; I could never again
transform them into sobriety. why,
then, should 1 deny myseli the
chemicals that oil my bearings,
lubricate my mind, and keep me run
ning smoothly?
