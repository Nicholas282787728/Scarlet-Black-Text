IIVAIJSMIGI T

Despite hordes of str g student fins
hounding him daily in the dining hall, Lyle
Franklyn Bauman remains a modest, goofy,
and illl-M'Olll‘ld lovcablc Gr iicll dining hall
[COIL “I don’t know lfI tlcscrvc as much as I
get," he said, smiling sheepishly. lfrhe student
initiative to malt Lyle the free of the new

mpus puh is a sign, Grinnells students may
di gree.

While the pub is named him Iiini, Bulk
man, who is reverently knmm to campus only
as Lyle, is a namesake him ilie was named
after his father and for lunch of his life was
known as "junior," An admitted Iowa "lifer,"
Lyle grew up in Malcolm, the youngest ofsix
children, One of Ins brothers. Roger Bauman,
who works in the PEC, is another Grinncll
Student favorite.

IVIdny students may only see Lyle us a
member of thc Grinncll family, but he has a
family of his own. Lyle has been married to
his wife Kim for 28 years, and they hlwe n is
year-old daughter, Allison and a 17, reareold
son, Wyatt. “I think I’ve done a pretty good
job," said Lyle of his parenting. “They apply
themselves and they haven’t been in trouble."

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of
teenage Lyle. “l was a hit era hcllion in high
school," he said. Lyle's youthful ways resulted
in Kim's father forbidding her to date him, ins
sisting he was ii had inﬂucncc. “Looking back,
I understand what he was talking about," said
Lyle “I think I proved him wrong."

Luckily, the couple met againyears later,
when Lyle was our riding his mororeyele, an
important purchase for rhe young Lyle. “The
only waymy dad would let me get it was to
shave my heard," he said.

Lyle no longer has the bike, hut his heard
has come back to stay, along with new Wisdom.
“Unfortunatelyl did way too much drinking"
he said, describing his younger self, “and [I
did] just what I had to to get by."

Although he may not have pushed himself
to work when he was young, Lyle stays active
now. He has served as both volunteer EMT
and fireman for Poweshiek County, owns land
on which he grows com and beans and raises
cattle.

Lyle does have one hobby he is less openly
proud of, though. “I’m a pretty avid hunter,"
he said, but then looked distressed, worrying
about the many vegan and vegetarian students.

“Ifuny ofthem get offended Iwould be upset,"
Lyle said,

Lyle tries to make up for his hohhyin other
ways. "I love feeding the wildlife,"he said. “Be—
ing a hunter, some of rhe guys give me a hard
time that I’m going to turn soft on them.”

But GrinnrJJ students already know that
Lyle is a big softie at heart. “My family and
the students here at Grinnell are two of my
favorite things," he said.

In addition to the naming of the pub and
a commissioned portrait, Lyle was especially
touched by a surprise 50th birthday party stur
dents threw for him two years ago. “It was very
emotional," he said. “I treat the students pretty
well and they treat me tremendous."

AARON BAKER

one of the ways Lyle treats students well
is by inviting them over to his house. Lyle
and his family live on land between Brooklyn
and Victor in a new house they designed and
helped build, “We plan on being there until
the end," he saidThey do a lor of barbccuing
and have students over to swim in the pond
and play with his countless cats and his rat ter-
riers Taffy and Pepper.

“1 love having them come over to the plane
to relax and unwind," Lyle said. “There’s no
gate on the driveway. Any one of them is welt
come at any time."And ifyou don’t have a ear,
he will be more than willing to give you a ride.
When it comes to Lyle, you don‘t even have
to ask.
