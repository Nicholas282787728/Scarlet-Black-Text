The Scarlet and Black

B-Bullers Bolted Down

Big Bill \Varren blasted thliomEr
runs, but his booming bat was un-
able to Change the outcomes of
Wednesday's 19~4 and 872 losses
to Cornell.

The baseball team also suilered
an lBrl bombing applied by William
Penn in a nonconierence game on
Monday.

Belore Cornell's 7 homertlns put
the lust game out at reach, the
Pioneers deadlocked the Rams :it
Is] in the initial inning when Don
Bognanno lend oil with a walk and
scored on Jell Dick's double

Grinnell's other three runs came
in the iourlh inning on a Warren
shot over the leit field ience

The second contest was (it you’ll
pardon the expression) a complete-
ly different ball game as Chip Hall's
pitching and tight team detensive
play kept the Rains within the Pins
neel‘s' reach until the late innings,

However, the third phase Oi the
gameuhlttingr-ditl not improve as
the Pioneers were able to Crack
only 3 base hits in each game
Warren and Dick hatl two hits and
Mark Hanisch and Ed Hirsch each
added one Don Bognanno Walked
his way to ﬁrst base six times.

Overall, the Pioneers performed
much better in this doubleheader
than in the iirst two games oithe
year when they lost to Cornell 13-3

GRINNELL (88)" S. K, Rewyu,
president oi Rookum Enterprises,
announced today that 1972-73 might
see a change in the Crime“ grading
system, although a detinite decision
has not yet been reached Unable to
answer any of our questions and un-
willing to speculate, Mr. Rewyu
invued us on a pei‘sonallyrconducted
tour of the film‘s interesting Mu—
seum oi Extinct Grading Systems,
“to make it up to you guys.”

Mr. Rewvu described the initial
system (in use until 1937738) as
the "Model 'T' " oi the Rookum
line indeed it was, as it was sturdy
but rather lmpel'lect. However, it
was used for almost 00 years or
about twice as long as all the suce
ceeding systems combined This
was basically it

In 1937—38 the creaking old system
was completely overhauled, the
Rookum brantlrnalne being the only
recognizable teature, This was a
remarkably ”radical“ system (in
the Grinnell tradition). “we had to
change,” newyu said ompetition

them all the track inr awhile!"

too ‘Tlte homes weren't too
catchy," S K, explained, "but after-
awhile, we hit on a "better idea,"
it's not too healthy to stand in one
place too long anyway, The public
catches onto you, and you’re in big
trouble then So, in #1445. We

and 13rd, despite the lopsided score
at Wednesday’s first game This duel
turned into a route because Cornell
parlayed small Fowler Field and (i
strong wind into several Tours
baggers while Grinnell did not.

The biggest improvement mm the
beginning oi the year is the team's
lielding; it made 6 errors (Dilly one
in the second game) Wednesday,
as opposed to 15 during the tirst
Cornell doubleheader,

Monday started on poorly tor the
Pioneers beiore the Penn game even
started when they learned that team
carcaptain and starting shortstop
John Videtlch hurt his knee overtlle
weekend and would be out for the
rest oi the season Videtich, a
316 hitter last year, was also hit
ting well this year beiore he was
sidelined, so his presence in the
lineup will be sorely missed.

Misiortune struck during the game,
too, Steve Varys broke his leg along
with Penn's shutout when he slid
into home in the seventh inning
The absence of this versatile player
(or the rest oi the season is also
a tough blow lor the team.

On the more positive side: Hir-
sch so perplexed the Penn batters
with a tantalizing assortment Di ollr
speed pitches that the wideeeyed
iniield umpire asked in bewildere
merit, "What’s this guy got’”

Ed usually calls it “stull.”

. History Of Grading

This was a more Streamlined and
modernized version or our pioneer
system. We raised each old classir
iication one grndErpointrrinilalion,
you knovt'rrand made “D” a more
respectable grade ("passing" In-
stead oi the selirdemeanlng "barely
passing“). We also introduced, tor
the first time, a few very familiar
classiﬁcations "
A, Excellent, 4. B, Superior, 3.0;
C, Satisiactory, 2 o; D, Passing,
1.0; F, Failing, 00; wp/wr
Withdrawn while passing/iatling‘

("ln1958-59,we addedanew, mid»
dleeoi-the-road model, ingeniously
called “C»plus," Satisfactory, 2.5
points”).

”In '66r67, we switched back to a
simple numerical system, much
preierred by our engineers All
those messy letters were discarded
and grade points took their place!
This system also included a new,
cleverly deceptive gimmick, the
CREDIT/FAIL optiotlupeople actur
ally imagined that they weren’t being
graded! But ll they weren’t, how
could they iail7 Pretty tricky, huh!”

4.0, Excellent; 3.5,Superioi 3.0,
Very good, 2,5, Good; 2 o, Satis»
iactory, 1.0, Passing; 0.0, Faile
ing; CR, Credit, AU, AUDIT

"Unlortunately, this system wits
unpopular and lasted only Syears.
So we returned to the tladitlonal
letterrgrade system once again
This is the system now under contro—
versy. We simply replaced the num-
bers with letters (A, A», B, B», C,
D, F) Now this "A, B, C, erase“
proposal comes along, and we‘re
laced with a new dilemma, It's up
to the consumer to decide, and
they’re so iussyl Why, this system's
only three years oldnlots ol good
years still ion in it, I think'”

Inlormed oi a recurring proposal to
do away with grades altogether, a
visihly shaken s K, Rewyu eXr
claimed, ”That's FREPOSTEROUS'
They can‘t do that! We'll go out of
business!"

When informed that this wouldn‘t
be ieasmle for quite some time (it
ever), he regained his calm But
maybe, someday in the unseen, un»
promised iuture, we can walk
through the halls of his museum and
see the remnants oian entirely ex~
tinct commodity, grades, where
they belong, in a display case, not

Golfers lose Two, Win One

The Pioneer golf team ran into
still opposition inst Monday as they
continue to try tor their first Wins
ning season in several years. Piny—
ing in Cedar Rapids, Grinnell der
teated the host Cornell sound by a
score of 9rl/Z - 34/2, but [ell
to defending conterence Champ St.
Olaf 4rl/2 - lO-l/Z, and Carle-
ton 6rl/Z r 9-1/2].

Skip Tredway came through with a
strong '76 to lead the Grinnell cone
tingent on a cold, breezy day. Wally
Bowers was hitting the hall a ton,
but missed a few short putts to
come in wltll an 82. Tom Lincoln
continued to play well with an 83
as Arturo Tapia was struck with
putting woes, taking 42 putts en route
to an 84. Phil Saslch shot all 85
in filth spot and AlSchoene stumbled
to an 88,

it wiisn’t really adisastrous day tor
the squad, but nobody really shot up
to thElr potential, That the team is
much improved is evident when it is
considered that last year Grinnell
was shut out by St, Olaf 15-0. The
season record now stands at three
wins and three losses in conference
dual meet competition with a quad»

rangular meet being played today in
Cedar Rapids against Cornell, (Ice,
and Beloit. Coach Edd Bowers, in the
hospital this past week ior more knee
surgery is trying to schedule a

couple or more meets to replace the
UNI-Warthurg tournament which
was rained out last weekend. Also
upcoming is the l-lawkeye invitation-
al on May 9, with most or the Col-
lege teams in iowa slated to appear

late Note

Grinnell put together a one team
etlort, led by Chuck McGrath, to
Win the Central College Relays last
Wednesday. Central ﬁnished two
points behind Grinnell in the Seven
team iieid. Grinnell champions were
McGrath in the mile and three mile,
setting new meet records in each,
Chris Madson in the pole vault,
and Dave Wright in the long jump.
Fine etlorts were also turned in by
Jim Pirolli, Barry Hull, and John
