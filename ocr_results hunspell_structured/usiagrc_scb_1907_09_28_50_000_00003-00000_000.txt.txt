XNTERCOLLEGE FOOTBALL NOTES

Few important chnnges have been
made in the football rules this year,
Owing to the universal satisfaction
giuen by the new rules last year. The
following changes have been made:

An Linoreased length of game, ﬁve
minutes being added to each half.

Two umpires. as lcrmerly, will be
used, but their duties are deﬁned more
speciﬁcally, One will aid the referee
in decisions down the ﬁeld and is
called ﬁeld judge. He is practically
an assistant to the releree. The other
has control or the decisions helonging
to the lineup.

Forward passing has been so altered
as to make it less risky on the ﬁrst
and second downs. Instead of losing
the ball if it touches the ground be-
fore strikingnplayor, the same side
retains the ball, ii in either" ﬁrst or
second downs, but the team loses ﬁi~
teen yards in distance. I: however,
the ball strikes ground before it does
aplayer on the third down, the ball
goes to the opposite side as formerly.

A line mall may now carry the ball,
providing he does not leave his post
tion in the line until alter the ball is
put in play.

In the use of the forward pass, trip-
ping or hurdllng by the side not put-
ting the ball into play in a scrimmage
will be penalized niteen yards.

A min is entitled to a. fair catch
when it is possible for him to reach
the hall before it strikes the ground,
the raising of the right hand now be»
ing unnecessary.

In order to prevent signalling by
one lndn and a catch and run by an-
other, ii one man of the side signals
his intention 01' making a fair catch,
and then another of his side makes
the Catch, the latter ,playei‘ may not.
run with the ball, nor is he even en-

titled to the pi'li‘ilege of a. fair catch,
but the hull must be downed where
caught and scrimmage by his side bar
gin.

Questions of hurdllng are put with-
in the iuriariiotion oi the referee.—
Minnesota Dally.
