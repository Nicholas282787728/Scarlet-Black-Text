“i enjoy teaching athletics, which is what
coaching is all about. I like to see the guys
I’ve taught do well or at least progress
beyond their starting point.”

Athletics has played a big part in the lite
of Mo ilunt. A two-year toothall captain
at Kentucky State and a draitee of the
Kansas City Chiefs, M0 says that he ”likes
competition”. Such a statement makes you
wonder why he came to Grinnell. Mo ans-
wers very simply that he wanted to coach
on the college level, regardless of the
place, as this offered an opportunity to move
to “bigger and hetter things." Fortunately,
for Grinnell, he does not foresee leaving
in the near future unless he gets “one
helluva offer” that would allow him to do
what he wants to do.

What does he want to do? First and fore-
most, but not exclusively, coach. “I would
like to be of service to the college Comr
munity and also serve in the capacity whr
ich I serve now.” he says, ”I enjoy contact
with students because 1 feel that I can re

have.” This is not an overstatement as
