GRIFFITH IS SPEAKER
Al SEﬂN’S BHAPEL

A College Training Gives one In-
tellectual Superiority and
Good Mental Grasp.

Professor D. D. Crirlitb was the
speaker in Senior chapel Friday. He
said that college students need not;
tear that they will be unprepared for
his outside of college, for their train- I
ing has given them superiority or in<I

ledge or life, The college man us»
ually shows no hesitsncy in taking
up his work.

No person, however, should think
his education is ﬁnished because he
has graduated lrom college for in
reality he must continue to learn olll
his lite, otherwise he remains at the
same intellectual age as when he
graduated. A man's standing in his
community is determined by the In—
tellectual liic he leads there.

All college activities have back of
them a spiritual motive which is not
commonly found in later lite outside
of the church and school.

Bell] Leaders Are Teachers

Every real leader, besides having
mental powers and splrltaul ideals,

that he may teach his ideals to oth—
ers, for only in this way will his
training bear fruit. The leader must
also use patience in his teaching and
be able to use another‘s point of view,
and limitations. He cannot dominate
by rorce of personality alone but
must also have the power or eKDo<
sition.

others are slow to accept the stu-
dent, He must ﬁrst move that he has
ability sound judgment, breadth ct
knowledge, and capacity for leader»
