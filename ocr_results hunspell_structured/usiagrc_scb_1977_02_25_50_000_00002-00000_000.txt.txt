Student groups make proposals

by John St: auss

Although the administrative
reorganization took place over six
months ago, its effects are Still
being seen. The Affirmative Action
Advisory Committee and the
Student Input Committee were
formed last semester as a result of
the shuffle and are now developing
specific proposals. The Af-
iirmative Action Adiiisory Com-
mittee is developing plans and
policies to ensure a positive af-
firmative action program at
Grinnell. The Student input
Committee is iormalizing the
policies by which students are
involved in the hiring and
evaluating of student service
administrators

The Affirmative Action Advisory
Committee headed by Dean Mary
Eysenbach, has produced a
document which addresses
procedures tor locating women and
minority candidates. The
document states that “each
department shall actively seek
women and minority candidates by
including in announcements of
openings sent to graduate
departments 3 statement of in
terest in minorities and women
candidates, by contacting women's
caucuses and minority groups
within professional associations,
and by contacting persons who
may know of appropriate potential
candidates ”

The committee has also gathered

North Campus residence halls.
Twodoor, frost-free refrigerators
have been installed in Smith,
Langan, Rawson, Gates, Clark,
Cowles and Dibble, Refrigerated
drinking fountains have been put in
the second and third ﬂoors of
Cowles.

Painting dorm rooms, halls and
other spaces is an ongoing project.
The painting of Read was come
pleted earlier this semester. while
Mears should have its paint job

Clark will be worked on following
the completion of Mears.

The Residence Hall 1m,
provements Committee is in
vestigating the possibility of
building an additional laundry
facility on South Campus to be put
in Gardner Lounge. The committee
is currently working with Barnes
Washer Service to establish a
proper ventilation system. This
plan, however, is not yet definite.

According to Susan Greeanrim,
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and committee member, the
college's 310.000 dollar yearly
improvement fund has a small
budget left for improvements.
Students with suggestions for hall
improvements that do not require
a great deal oi manpower are
advised to take proposals to their
hall representatives.

statistics that show a def
availability of women ior teaching
positions, For example, in {975, 57
per cent of all degrees earned in}
art were earned by women,
Grinnell, however, has no female
professors in that field.

A subcommittee of the Student
Input Committee has written a
document that sets guidelines for
the hiring and periodic evaluation
of student service administrators.

in the area of hiring procedures,
the document states that ”serious
Considerations should be given to
the concern of Students involved in
the interviewing process, Where a
decision differs greatly from tth
desires or priorities of the student .
group, the appropriate ad-
ministrator shall meet with
relevant students to discuss and.
explain the decision in the event .
that there remains Considerable
disagreement after such
discussion, the supervisor shall
seriously reconsider the decision to
hire the Candidate "

The document also proposes that
student service administrators be
evaluated two years
after their initial hiring, and every
three years after that. Specific
guidelines for evaluations are
included in the document. The
evaluations will be phased in.

According to Ruth Montgomery,
SGA President and committee
member, the entire committee Wlfl.
meet soon to consider and finalize
the document.

Montgomery explained that the
terms have been tentatively ap\
proved by President A. Richard
Turner and Dean Waldo Walker.
Their formal approval is needed
for implementation of the
proposal,
