Pioneers Beat
Bears, 45-29

Luick Paces Grinnellians
to Win Saturday

By WELLS BARNETT

Glinnell‘s erratic cagers re~
versed form again Saturday night,
to come through with a 45729 win
over the Washington university
Bears in a return engagement. The
Bears had beaten Grinnell the
week before at st. Louis by a 28-
23 score. In all fairness it must
he said that Washington didn't
have much more than one of Grin-
hell’s intramural teams, but the
Pioneers were a changed outfit as
they took command of the game
from the outset, ran up an 13—12
lead at halftime, and were never
threatened seriously during the en.
tire game.

Biggest surprise of the evening
was Wilbur Luick, giant Pioneer
center, who came through with a
bag—load of trick shots and tossed
in eight baskets for a high-score
total of its points. Luick, ineffec-
tive in previous games, came to
life early in the game and got
three of his buckets in the first
half, contributing the other five as
Grinnell rode the crest of the win-
ning wave in the second period.

William Conwill, who ably sec-
onded the drive, played his best
game this year, passed brilliantly,
and contributed nine points to the
team total to tie with Co-Caplain
Dean for second scoring honors.

Outstanding for Washington
were Uhlerneyer, forward, and Ha-
feli, forward, who, in spite of a
hard game with Drake the night
before, played like maomen to try
to stem the tide. Uhlemeyer got
four baskets for eight points, all in
the second half, while Hafeli rang
up five points. Ferfecky, substi—
tute center, was second for the
Bears with seven points. Beeler,
highly—rated regular center, was
completely tied up by Luick and
was able to score only one field
goal,

"When talking pictures arrived, my
stage experience on Broadway gave
me my chance on the screen. Taking
care of my throat became serious
business with me, so I changed to
Luckies—a light smoke. Of course I
smoke other cigarettes now and then
but sooner or later I come back to
Luckies. They make a hit with my
throat and also with my taste.”

_ An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Stanwyck veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s Why so many of them
smoke Luckies.You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
