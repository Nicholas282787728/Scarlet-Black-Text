The Heritage Foundation. in a Sur-
prise move tbeiore the Sandimsta take
overt, announced its intentions Thurs
day to wrest control oi the Scarlet it
Black [mm the Grinnell College
trustees in orde to “establish a credi-
ble news souro in this eastern Iowa
[Own

A Foundation spokesman issued a
statementat 1 pm EST iting the “bias
tent and wreckless disregard ior any
and all news relevant to the cause oi the
conservative elements at the greatest
nation on the iaee oi the earth” as the
justification oi the takeover attempt.

“The tirinnell Hel’aldrRegister. the
Grinnell Magaztnei 1(ch Radio and
t‘spt‘clnllv the Scarlet tit Black have

displayed a consistent liberal bias and
have worked at every opportunity to
smear the good name oi President
Reagan. former Sen. Roger Jepsen and
any other organization that stands ior a
Stronger and better America."

The trustees are reportedly consider-
ing the $3.5 million after for 200.000
shares. a controlling 52 percent ot all
outstanding stock. Staff members, who
fear the takeover will affect the cur-
rent Marxist editorial slant 0! the
paper, are apparently hopeiul that in
dustry gian, Ted Turner will steprin as
a white knight.

Meanwhile fears of an unstable
future are causing the editorial stall at
the 35:8 to make plans to jump to

another venerable campus publication
the Outcry

‘We may as well get it mer with "
said Editor in chiei Robert Quashie.
“We know as well as anyone that all
liberals become Republicans as soon as
they graduate anyway. Just look at
Squat. he's already dressing like a
damn Yuppie.”

McLean. a senior at Grilinell College,
is apparently postponing law school tor
a year to stay on and edit the new stirs.

“It‘s just p/ tot my duty to God and
Jesse [Helm]." he said "Besides. now
i can run this great drawing oi a
donkey's hind-end thdl l’ve been save
ing ”
