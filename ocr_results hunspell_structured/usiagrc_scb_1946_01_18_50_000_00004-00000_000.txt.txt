PIONEER CAGERS PLAN VENGEANCE
AT BELOIT INVASION TONIGHT

Under the leadership of Bell Douglas, former Gl-innell mi
mentor who returned to his duties as basketball coach for

tile Pioneer Squad this week,
hard at work for their return duel with the Beloit quintet

on the Darby coul't tonight.

Beloit now leads the conference

roster with n perfect record of 31
stiaight victories. The Gun-
nellians were handed a stinging
defeat by the Beloit five at Ben
loit Jan. 5, and are planning on
a different story this time. The
game will begin at 7:30 o’clock.

The Pioneer cage team bowed
to Coc College at Cedar Rapids
last Saturday night, with the
final tally giving Coe 64 points
to 39 for the Grinnellians. The
playing was well—matched for
most of the first half, after the
local cagers had taken an early
lead with two quick goals in the
first minutes of the game. The
half-time seore stood 25-17 with,
the Kohawks in the lead.

The Coe quintet was too hot
to handle in the second half of the
contest and paced by their sharp-
shootiug forward Tvrdik, they
piled up the 54-39 victory by the
final gun.

The Pioneers fought a tight
floor game, but could not score
when they had opportunities. The
Crinnell five's striking power was
reduced when Bob Williamson,
high-scoring Pioneer forward, was
ejected from the game on a tech-
nical foul during the second half
of the game.

Williamson Tops
Conference Tally;
Beloii Man Nexi'

Bob Williamson, Grilmell's high
scoring forward, is now top man
in the Midwest conference indi-

conference tally to date is 55
points in four games. Johnny Er—
ickson, Beloit forward, is running

son. The conference leaders have
scored a total of 203 points in
their three victories over Grin»
nell, Cornell and Ripon.

race is Coe college, also undefeatr
ed in the conference. The Coe
Cagcrszlll be hosts to the Be-
loit five tomorrow night at Ce»
dar Rapids, in a game that will
see one of these teams dropped
from the unbeaten ranks this
season. ,

tet is in fifth place in the cone
fercnce race, with one victory o
er Cornell and losses to Beloit,
