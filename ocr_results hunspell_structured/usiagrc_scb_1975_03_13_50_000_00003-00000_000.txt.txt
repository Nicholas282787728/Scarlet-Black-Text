Fallace,

. Nadalsky tops
in conference

by Judy wicgci

Grinnell's track team finished its
indoor season with a iair showing
in the Midwest Indoor Conference
Track Meet, held last Friday night
at the PEG. Because of the unof-
licial nature of the meet. no team
scores were kept; but an unofficial
count put the Pioneers in fourth
place among the six teams coma
peting. tThe Wisconsin schools and
Lake Forest did not make the trip.)
Coe, Carleton, and Monmouth took
the first three spots.

Mike Nadalsky got things under
way for Grinnell with a first place
in the triple jump at 42'9".
Nadalsky has not been defeated
this indoor season in his specialty.
and the conference win was his
fifth consecutive Victory. His best
jump this season was 43%", an
effort which put him almost six
feet ahead of his nearest com-
petitor.

After Mark Bailey gave Grinnell
another point with his 20’2"
seasonal best in the long jump,
good for fifth place, the hhorelay
team (Mark Schultz, Mark
Bowman, Bailey and Jim Fallace)
chased Coe to the finish line in
l:38.l, also a seasonal best. Shortly
afterwards, Schultz added another
second place finish in a very close
so yard dash.

The second high point in the meet
for Grinnell came in the 440 dash,
as Jim Fallace cruised Into first
place with a 53 7, 3 yards in front oi
Goszowski of Coe. The victory
turned the tables on the C09 run-
ner, who had beaten Fallace the
week betore in a quadrangular
meet

Terry Scebcrgor ran a well-
paced 1000 to filiish fifth and record
his best time of the season, only to
find that he had been disqualified
ror stepping inside the line.
Carleton's second place finisher iii
the event was also disqualilied. as
[his \i‘ellaknoii‘n rule was
stringently cntorocd lor the first
time at lhc PEC The two
ilisqiialifications gave Grinncli's

Hey!

improving Phil Cebuhar a fifth
place linish.

Jim Briles of Grinnell did not
have quite enough energy to move
past the two leaders in the final
stretch of the SUOVyard dash, but
finished a strong third in 121715.
immediately aiterwards the
Pioneers found themselves
unlucky again as disqualification
nullified the fine performance and
third place finish of Mark Blan-
chard in the halfamile run. Blans
chard was a victim of the same
rule that Caught Seeberger, which
should teach the Pioneers
something about running inside the
White line.

After Schultz scored once again
with a third place for Grinnell in
the nil-hurdles, Tom Howland
unleashed a scorching kick in the
last lap oi the twoemile, easing into
fourth place in the last 30 yards of
the race. The mile relay team oi
Fallace, Bowman. Blanchard and
Briles, inspired by Howland’s
demonstration, finished off with a
close third place for Grinnell in the
mile relay

Considering the disqualifications
and some temporary losses due to
injuries, Coaches Hunt and Van
Scotter are fairly optimistic about
the upcoming outdoor season.
Unless the Wisconsin schools‘ are
stronger than expected, the
Pioneers should be able to hope for
their best outdoor conference
showing in several years‘

_ Winters: a triple
All-American?

by Dave Calvert

The men's swim season ended
nearly two weeks ago lor most of
the Midwest Conference, and,
naturally, tor the Grinnell
Pioneers as a team, It’s not over
yet, however, tor ten oi the cone
ierence's outstanding swimmers,
five of whom are Grinnellians.

Those still in trai rig for Coach
Ray Obermiller's Pioneer squad
are senior coacaptains Bob winters
and Tom Rowat, sophomores John
Chambers and Doug Johnson. and
ireshman Greg Olson, What
they’re training for is a shot at
becoming AlleAmericans at next
week’s Division III nationals.

Winters, who enters the come
petition for the third consecutive
year, is already otticially an All»
American. He quali ed tor the
honor last year in the 100~
backstroke competition at Long
Beach. Ca., clocking a 55.094 and
finishing in the necessary top
twelve nationally. Rowat is
returning for a second try this
year, having attempted in 1973
along with Winters and diver Larry
Hllntoon '74.

Winters is the only All-American
in the Midwest Conference to date,
although Knnx's five entries this
year. tree styler Steve Varick and
ilyer Mike Muro, may break into
his domain. Other MWC qualifiers
this year ~e Tom Cmejla and
Dave Wright, both of Ripon, and
buttertlyer Steve Spangler oi Lake
Forest.

Although winters reigns alone
now, there have been no shortages
in recent years for Grinnell.
Obcrmiller, who gives Winters “an

excellent chance" at becoming a
triple Air/American next week, has ,
sent his players to nationals in
each oi the last seven years.
although this is the biggest con-
tingent yet. A former Big Eight
diving champion and an overall
winner in eight oi his nine years as
Grinnell swim Coach. Obermillcr
has fostered six Grinnell All-
Amcricans: John McBlain and
Bruce Rollins '71; Jim Corns,
MikeDaley, and Steve Ward, '72;
and Winters Tho iirst five are all
iree stylers.

winters is calm about the up-
coming three-day meet, “I'm just
goingtotry to makeitagain,drop
my times,” he mused early this
week. “You never know how it will
turn out until you see the teams
and individuals that are there 1' llc
conceded, however, that the
competition may be somewhat
easier this year, now that Grinnell
has been shiiteoirom Division ii to
Division ill

The meet begins Thursday,
March 20, in Meadviilc, Pa, at
Allegheny College, Obermiller will
be driving his stars down and back,
departing Tuesday. Until then,
according to winters, the menu is
”oonditioning’ ' and “hard work.”
