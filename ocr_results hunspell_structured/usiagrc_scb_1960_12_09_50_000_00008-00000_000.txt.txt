Mussel": 14 consecutive free
throws coupled' with his ten
buckets made him the game's
high scorer with 3—1 points. Ray
Horton had 13 markcs for
Grinncll, seven on charity tos

Jim Simmons, Jim Lowry,
Jon Grotcluschen. Horton and
Musser will probably start for
the Pioneers. However, Gar
Smith and Roger Miller are
challenging Groteluschen and
Denny Asby is challenging Hor—
ton for starting berths.

Coach John Ffitsch faces a
problem at having some boys
who are very good on offense,
but poor defensively and othcrsl
who are good on defense but
weak oriensivcly. Thus he hast
to either play a good offensivcl
unit, hoping that they will scorer
more points than they give a-
way or play a strong defensive
unit hoping to prevent more:
points than they make The dif-t
ficulty ‘is trying to achieve good
balance between the two and
to help the boys overcome their
weaknesses.
