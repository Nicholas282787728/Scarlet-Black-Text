chglioranza gives baritone recital

By Laura Waxman

This Sunday,April 12a18:00 pm,
‘ baritone Thomas Megltoranza will
‘ give a student recital in Herrick
Chapel with music professor John
‘ Stuhr-Rommereim as the accompa-
, nying pianist.
To beperformed are twocomplete
‘ song cycles, "Dlehterliebe, Op, 48,"
. by Robert Schumann, and "An Die
' Feme Geliebte, 0p. 98," by Ludwig
van Beethoven. According to
‘ Mcglioranza, who chose the pieces
, for the recital, the Schumann and
Beethoven song cycles represent a
‘ pan of the German romantic era and

are demanding for both the pianist
and the singer.

“These are pieces I‘ve wanted to
sing for a long time," said
Meglioranza, who went on to say
that he and Stuhr—Rommeriem have
worked very hard together in prepa-
ration ior the concert.

According to Stuhr-Rommereim,
Schumann was an innovator in creat»
ing more a prominant role for the
pianist in song cycles. Thus, Stuhr-
Rommeriem feels especially chal-
Ienged,particularlyby lhisSchumann
piece which he has performed before
as singer rather than pianist.

This will be the last time that the

two musicians will perform together,
since Mcglioranza will graduate this
spring. Heplans on attendingEastman
School of Music in Rochester, New
York for graduate studies in classical
vow] performance.

Meglioranza became seriously in-
terested in singing during his sophor
more year at Grinnell. after he had
been encouraged to pursue vocal
training at a summer stock he the
tended. He has studied voice with
Stuhr-Rommeriem zltGrinnellaswell
aswithateacherin SantaBarbara last
summer. He will continue to study
with herthissummerbeforeenrolling
in Eastman in the fall.

looking at an artist's work should
think about the piece at which he or
she is looking. There should be room
for that person‘s imagination to un-
derstand in his or her own terms the
intricacies of what the artist is trying
to say. The artist can reality only
provide a hint. In black and white

photography, color becomes one of
the elementswhichthespectatormust
imagine."

The subjects in Levit's exhibit are
old, and have seen a lot in their time
"much can be teamed from studying
their faces. Levit‘s photographs will
be at Burling for the month of April.
