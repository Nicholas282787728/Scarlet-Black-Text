Ripon reigns for now
Grinnell, the defending tennis champ, falls to Ripon and Lawrence, but
with conference looming, they might not have seen the last of either squad

by Andrew Borneman

The men’s tennis squad had to settle their
nerves as they entered a dual with their peren—
nial rival, Ripon, last Friday. After all, the Pro-
neets were seeking to keep the Midwest con»
rerenee rule they took from the powerhouse
Red Hawks last year.

They’ll still have a shot come playorr time,
but last Friday. it was not to be, Ripon took
the match decisively. 6-1. Grinnell ﬁtted better
the following day against Lawrence. but still
took a hit from the Vikings 4.3.

Coming on the disappointing showing
against Ripon, the Pioneers tried to add eon-
sisreney to their me and ﬁnish the weekend
in a posiu've manner against
the Vikings. The resultwas

agonizing.

with Fenberr’s solid backhand: and overheads

ings, with an overall record of 17-7, and SrZ in conference.

“I genuinely believe that we’ll sweep Knox. but we have to
play like we did in Rockford," commented pirehet Kate
Reynolds ‘05.

Reynolds was reterting to last weekend’s Midvvot Confer-
ence CrossoverTournarncnt held in Rockford, Ill. The Pioneers
played ﬁve games against Carroll, lawrenee, Ripon, st. Norbert,

Ripon, driving in Grinnell’s winning run.

Defensively, die Pioneers were equally up to die task, mak»

“When people did oommit errors, we didn’t let that slow
