“DON’T EVER HARRY"

It is not so surprising, at that, that

Mr. Neilan should have produced
“Don't Ever Marry.” It is just such
ct comedy as all producers are always
seeking but which are seldom found.

There is not a laugh in it dependent "

upon the grotesqueness or any char-
acter, but. all the humor and comedy,
with which the picture abounds, come
from situations in which every day
people find themselvcs through a
combination or circumstances.

Edgar Franklin, in writing the tale
struck upon a theme which lent itself
admirably to adaptation to the mo-
tion picture screen. Mr. Ncilan has
translcrred all or the humor in the
original story, with some added touch-
es made possible only by the scope
of the camera. "Don't Ever Marry"
will he the attraction at the Strand
