BREAKFAST from page 1

had the option of language houses...Most
good schools have them. This was a faculty
dedsion. They had tried Lhree houses expen-
mentally for a while. The faculty were still
pushing. They asked the Dean of Students,
who as I understand it did not go to the
Housing Committee but did have meetings
with a variety of other student groups, But
thenultimately,studentdecisioninputdoesn't
always equal student derision working. This
was ultimately an academic decision [beyond
the responsibilities or the Housing Commit-
tee] and the Dean of Students made it and I
am comfortable with it. it wasn't my decision
but it is one that I supported.

5&3: It is the procedure that students are
most upset about. The SGA denounced the
proceedings because it was scene as a
violation ofpmcedurks.

PF: That’s Okay.

5801: But is it all right ﬁrr the administra-
tion to violate procedures?

PF: They didn't violate procedures...What
students have to remember is that this is
ultimately a decision to
be madebythe Deanof
Students. Could it have
been handled differ-
ently? Yes. But the ﬁnal
outcome would prob-
ably have been the
same....Did I know
what Dean Crady's de-
cision was going to be? Yes I did I can
understand people denouncing the decrsion,
but basically nowiwe're going to try lan-
guage houses.

5&3: And ifthese student groups, commit-
tees, and SGA have such limited power...

PF: It's not such limited power!

5&3: Limited in the sense that these deci-
sion are not in the hands ofthese commit-
tees, That they are in the hands ofadmin-
ixfratolsrir

PF: That's correct.

5&3: Do you believe that these student
institutions are worthwhile?

” [The administra-
tion] didn’t violate
procedures. ."

PF: Absolutely. The SGA advises in certain
areas but in other areas they give out a huge
amount of money. And as nearly as I can
seFrhere is a lot of dissension among stu-
dents about how SGA gives out money and
that is because in those areas they have that
power and that authority and we don't inter«
fere in that. In some areas they are the uln-
mate decision, but notin every area. You all
wouldn't spend so much time criticizing each
other ifthey didn't have some power. in some
areas like the concerts committee, students
have the ﬁnal word.

5&3: You mentioned you want Grinnell to
be stronger, and we’ve talked about
multiculturalism, what else is going to go
into making Gn'nnell a stronger Institu-
lion?

Pr: Better rad 'ries. Upgrading the old pan or
the science faci ty. Upgrading and expand-
ing ﬁne arts, adding a small museum, a
renovating Goodnow and turning it into a
home for anthropology. Also, working with
the budgeting process to make sure that we
havestrongﬁnandalaidpoliciesandtomake
sure that we pay fac-
ulty appropriately. If
we'regoingtohaveﬁrst
class faculty we’re go-
ingtohaveropaythem
that way. Our ﬁnan-
cial aid budget went up
11% this year and our
comprehensive fee
wentup 6%. It’s noteasy to do that....Grinnell
is fortunate that it is strongly endowed

5&3: Is it in the best interat ofthe school to
spend the endowment more aggressively to
upgrade the school and produce more pub-
licity? This is not what the administration
or the Board of rmsrces advocates. Why?

PF: Well because there is a difference in what
one thinks an endowment is for, What we do
is what other institutions do. But for our
endowment, our charge should be that Grin»
nell will be here 150 years from now and our
endowment should have the same spending
power and provide the same support 150
years from now. Anything less is really

irresponsible....the endowment has grown a
lot, and has ﬂuctuated a lot, because of the
way it has been invested. It has ﬂuctuated
$170 million in the last two years.

5&3: Are you or is the Board concerned
about the way that the endowment is
invested so heavily in the volatile stock
market?

Pr: They have a track
record of success and
they are pretty comfort-
able with it. It is man»
aged by several groups
which provides a bal-
ance,andsome oﬁtisin
bondsandtreasurybills.
These decisions are
talkedaboutallthetime
and re-afﬁr‘med. This is
a conscious decision
which is not written in stone.

3&3: Many Schools Grinneli's size have
mental health professionals on campus‘
why doesn’t Gn'nnell and why is [he Grind
nellCommuniryMentall-lealth Centerdif—
ﬁcult to get a prompt appointment with?

re: Notanymore, notfor the last 9 months. 1
changed that. Now it should be no more that
45 hours. And particularly in the case of
emergency or sexual assault and other simi-
lar issuesilmmediately.

5&1}: Students have been given the impres-
sion [over the phone] that the center was
busy and that there wasn’t to see them
promptly.

PF: Well i've got to tell you that I'm really
upset by that because l’d been told that the
process should not take more than two or
three days at the latest. If one said that it was
not an emergency...

5&3: ..A person who was upset about
Amelia Miller‘s suicide had to wait almost
a week for a meeting.

PF: She should have gotten in immediately.
and if that’s not happening I need to know
about that...let me check on that. We
recontracted so that wouldn’t happen. But
getting back to on-campus mental health let
me tell you what I know about that .ai one
time we did, but there was this feeling that
fewer the people were using the facility be-
cause it was on campus and there was a
certain lack of privacy when one walked in.
That is why the Dean or Students felt more
comfortable about [having the Grinnell CMHC
handle mental health services].

8&3: What are your views on ﬁwtball at

tors because we do not appropriate aca-
demic scholarship money for athletics.
There are also rumors that the team is
going to go by the wayside...

PF: ...WE ARE PLAYING FOOTBALL AT
GRlNNELL AS LONG AS I AM PRBIDENTIU
...Recruitirig has become a problem. Are we
going to cheat? NO. Grinnell doesn’t
cheat...l would not dream of commenting
about what other schools do or do not doi
butlhave heardthesame rumors youhuve.
One ofthe challenges we face...is that some
local schools with maybe a medium aca-
demic ranking—some of these people are
the smartest thattheygetso theycan legiti-
mately offer them an academic scholar-
ship. But we can't.

5&B: What have you learned from your
occasional lunches with Studen tAdvisors?

” [T he endowment]
has ﬂuctuated $170
million in the last
two years.”

PI: I've learned that most of the students
really like Grinnell. I've learned their perspec-
rive ofwhar is going on on campus. What is
important to them. A lot of it was talking
aboutwhatwasgolngonlntheworld.They’re
lunches where you just talk about whatever
people want to. One of the reasons I go to so
many events is to have a chance to talk to
students....l like being in the dorms, l was
invited to a great party
election night by the
pollu'calsdencedeparl-
merit. l’ve been invited
tostudybreaksinMain
and other places and I
really like that. I went
to Cowles after Amelia
Miller's death because
I knew there were un-
happy students there.
But beyond that I re-
ally respect the dormitories as your homes
and I am delighted to come, when I’m invited.

5&3: Do you think the current alcohol
policy needs to be changed?

PF: Lei me answer this carefully. Grinnell
College obeysihelow..,aolbelievethotNo
illegaldrinkingoccursoncampus? Ofcourse
not. But I do think that the college has a
responsibility....‘ihe most alarming thing
I've read in two years, in the 5&5, was a
story about the kid with the funnel in his
mouth at the party at Sunset Lodge and
pouring beerdown his ihroatbecausethat’s
how people die.

8&3:Butislhepolicyitselfll'kelytochange?

PF: 1 don't know. It's not high on my agenda.
It’s high on my agenda thotwe obey the law.

5&3: the percentage of graduates who
contribute money to Grinnell is lower than
at some comparable colleges, and aurstu-
dent attrition rate is higher. Are
onnnellians less satisﬁed with orinncll.7
Is that a fair assumption?

PF: ldon'r think the end of the question is fair.
Should we have a higher graduation rate? 1
think so.

sad}: What's needed fora higher gradua-
tion rate?

PF: Therateisimproving, theﬁve-yeargradu-
anon rate was around 83% last year. With
Grinnell's size and location some people
change their minds. By surveying departing
students about why they left and where they
plan to continue theireducarion, and making
sure people understand what Grinnell is and
what it isn’t, the graduation rate can be im-
proved.

5&3: There is a common perception that
retaining minority srudcnrs is dimculr...

Pr: ...That is inaccurate. At least last year,
and I can't go back over twenty years, the 4-
year graduation rate for African American
students was 85%. Maybe over a longer pe-
riod oftime that hasn’t been true but lastyear
was a good year.

5&3: lfyou could wish for one thing from
the student body, what would it be?

PF: I wish the student body would tolerate
more open expression of diverse opinions. l
worry ihatsome students who don'tshare the
most vocal opinion or who don’t feel comfort-
able asking questions [are being left out or
discriminated against]. 1 think if there was
more open discourse and more times when
people were notso emotionally angry...There
should be o place {or all opinions. [I
