“Broadway" At Colonial Theatre
Proves To Be High Grade
Presentation.

CAPABLE CAST GIVES PLAY

Theme of Traveling Production
Deals With Life In Typical
New York Night Club.

B) loseplr )lclico.

The performance of "Broadway"
last night proved that good road
shows will come to Grinnell and that
Grinnell people will patronize them,
The people who attended the play
were presented with a drama acted
and well-produced. Few people really
know what goes on back of glitter
and ,glarnor of the life of the chorus
in a Broadway cabaret and tor one to
see that there is life and human un-
derstandings and striving behind the
splendor of the cafe raises the tone of
nightlife.

The story of "Broadway" kceps it-
self well in the background and um
ravels naturally, never troubling the
auditor with complicated and unex-
pected action. The three acts are all
set in a private party r‘oom of the
Paradise Night Club, New York City.
Here one witnesses the loves and
hates of the cabaret dancer, the hilt-
tcr and egg man, the common crook
and the square croo _

To tell the story of "Broadway" is
difficult. There seems to be no plot,
_, t a climax is reached which is en-
tirely satislactory. The action seems
to center this Why. A bootlegger, who
‘ posing as a big butter and egg man,
desires a dancer in the cabaret. Tire
dabccrs lover secs through his ail~
vances and suspects him of the mur-
der ot a rival gangster, whose [lull—
cee is one of the dancers in the tabs
ar-et. It is learned that the bootleg-
ger killed the gangster and his fiancee
shoots him in revenge. The detective
who is on the case understands her
motive and sends in a report of
suicide The first dancer betrays her-
lover to the police unwittingly brrt he
clears himself and returns to claim
her when she finds out who the butter
and egg man really is.

It always is asked at one, what ac-
tors were outstanding and one besi-

plan, the annual feature debate is
expected to take place this Spring.

ty in all departments of Grinnell col-
lege are eligible to compete in the
$10,000 traffic contest being conducted

traffic publishcd in St. Louis. The
contest is intended to induce new
ideas on traffic control and regulation
and to cut down the tremendous death
toll taken in motor vehicle mishaps.

Thc problem of expediting traffic
and making it safer should especially
appeal to students interested in en-
gineering, but there are subjects in-
cluded in the contest on which other-
students may prepare plans Stu»
dents and faculty‘memhers at many
universities have entered plans in the
contest.

The question or how to abolish the
mechanically unsnle wrecks used by
many college students should provide
a special field of interest with the
annual influx of these cars into Grim

Barred From Conversation,

“A Doll's House,” the lbsen drama

next Friday evening at the colonial
theater was, at the time of its prem—
ier preformance in Copenhagen, the
theme of such heated discussions that
it was formally barred as a topic of

Play Full of Contrasts.

It is a play full of ironic coincid-
ence and picturesque contrast. Fes-
tivity, Christmas tinsel, a tar-antella,
a masque balliall shine against a
background of despair and selfstors
turc. "Oh what a wonderful thing to
live to be happy," lighthearted Nora
cries just as the door bell rings and
announces Krogsmg who brings her
despair.

Hope Huston will play the lead.
Norma Helmer, a frivolous young wife.
othmcr Wohlgemuth whose work in
“The Fool" and "Gods of the Morm-
talns" will be remembered, will play
the role of Torvald Helmer, Nora's
husband. Lysle Hartley will be the
disillusioned Dr. Rank and Russell
Gray will ca y the role of the des-
psrate Krugstug. Both Mr. Gray and
Mr. Hartley were members of “The
Fool" and “Gods of the llontain"
casts. Mary G, Jones and Luella Hall
complete the cast.

“A Doll's House" is the play which
brought lbsen before the English»
speaking world. The Dramatic club
production celebrates the playwrights
oneehundredth anniversary, missing
the exact date of his birth by only
