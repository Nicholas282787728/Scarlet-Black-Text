;After winning the Midwest Con-
ference championship last fall. the
Grinnell College women's soccer
team is looking to achieve excellence
by defending its title. Tlle kickers
open on the road this Saturday in St
Paul, Minn. against nonecontcrcnce
competitor Augsburg at 1:00.

Tlle team. which has come back
in extremely good shape and with a
very excited attitude, looked good,
despite losing, 2-1, last Sunday when
it faced the Grinnell alulnni in the
Lalonde Alumnae Cup scrimmage.

“Although we lost the scrimmage,
I was pleased wllh our overall play

because we were able to make proper
adjustments and see how we would
react in a gamc-like situation," come
merited Couch Jenny Wood. “We
obviously were a bit nervous and tens
tattve at first, but we eventually
calmed down and were able to stick
to our game plan, wlitch is what we
need to continue the entire season."

The first half ended with the
alumni leading the varsity squad, 2,
l. Anya Schwartz ‘93 netted both
goals for the alums, while Sally
Goodspeed ‘98 was able to loft an
impressive shot into the back of the
goal off of a restart for the Pioneers.

The second half did not produce
any goals. bitt did not lack excitement

as both teams had many opportuni-
ties and possessed the ball with au-
thority.

“I was happy that we were able to
hold them scoreless in the second
half because it showed us that we had
made the proper adjustments and
were able to play well defensively
against some very talented players,"
remarked Wood. “1 am looking for-
ward to this season because every
one has come back ready to go. It is
quite apparent that all of the players
have worked hard in the off—season.
We have a number of experienced
starters returning and, coupled with
a large corps of firsteyears, I am exr
pecting good things out of this team."

Men step-up training for
the Cornell Ram Run

“This is a better team than the one
we had last year," noted Grinnell
College men’s cross country coach,
Will Freeman. The veteran mentor
will take over 20 runners to the
Cornell Ram Run this Saturday as the
squad opens the 1997 season.

Last Saturday the Pioneers ran a
5000M workout to test their ﬁtness.
“We look pretty fit,"
said Freeman. “Our
top group looks
stronger and deeper
this season."

The barriers are
led by veterans Neil
Gipson, Dari
Madigan and Kevin
Notheis. The trio
has produced qual-
ity performances in
both cross country
and track. “These young men are
tested, proven runners," explained
Freeman.

Another returnee, Nat Hopkns,
surprised his teammates with a solid
performance at the ﬁtness run. “Nat
obviously trained well," Freeman
pointed out. ,

Grinnell has a host of first and
second-year runners to round out the
top group. Rookies John Aerni and
Rob Park both ran well Saturday.
Their classmates, Paul Paquesi and
Ben Portilla, had solid high school
careers and Coach Freeman expects
them to run in his top echelon.
Sophomores Matt Prekker, Casey
Miller and Andy Nelson all have a
year in the program. Freeman also
thinks seniors Andrew Jacobson and
Kentner Cottingham will contribute.

On Nov. 1 the Pioneers will host
the Midwest Conference champion
ship meet. Last fall the Grinnellians
finished second after winning the
title 10 straight years. “We are key»
ing on the conference meet but we
also want to make a jump to the
NCAA Regional," noted Freeman.
“We moved up on the region last year
and we‘re looking to do the same this
fall."

New recruits charge
women’s lineup

This season the Grinnell College
women‘s cross country team hopes to
get back on top of the Midwest Con-
ference, Last year Carroll ended
Grinnell’s fiveeyear run of MWC
championships.

“We hope we can start a new string
ofchampionships. However, Carroll
won conference last yearwidl ayoung
team and that
might make it
tough," said Coach
Evelyn Freeman.
The Pioneers open
Saturday at Cornell
in the Ram Run in
a two-mile trek that
features teams
from the surround
ing area.

Grinnell’s squad
will not be lacking
quantity as 29 women turned out.
Becca Webel, last year's conference
runnerup, returns to lend aroster that
includes 12 rerun-tees and 17 newcome
ers. “With 13 ﬁrst-year students and
four transfers and upperclassmen, this
was our biggest turnout of new people
in along while," exclaimed Freeman.

The group ran in the Happy Days
5k Run held in Grinnell last Saturday
to get time trials for planning work-
outs. Senior Webel was first with a
time of 20:22 and Chava Goldstein
and newcomer Meghan Moerke fol-
lowed in 20:24 and 21:04. Geny
Reister (21:22) edged rookie Idelle
Cooper (21: 8) while Sarah Liegl
(21:29) finished in front of newcomer
Katie Converse (22:05). ”Claire
Pirkle, one of last year’s best, did not
run but will return this week," added
Freeman.

Carroll has a good shot at success-
fully defending its title with the re—
tuming conference champion who
also Wm the runner-up at nationals.
But, the race for the championship
includes just 10 teams as Coe and
Cornell are out of the conference.
Freeman concludes, “We have a good
inﬂux of talent to complement our
veterans. We should be really good."

Heading into the 1997 season
there are a lot of question marks for
the Grinnell College men's soccer
team. With a group of tested plays
ers and a talented rookie corps, vetr
eran coach John Pfitsch thinks his
squad will continue its strong tradi»
tion of winning soccer.

This Saturday the Pioneers open
at Luther, a team which advanced to
the ﬁnal four in NCAA Division III
last fall. On Monday, Sept. 13 at
1:00 the Pioneers host Knox in their
home and Midwest Conference

opener.
Grinnell is coming off a 778 sea-
son and hopes to rebound with a
solid year. Last fall the Pioneers kept
alive a string ofeight-straight league
tournament appearances, advancing
to the semiﬁnals before falling to
Lake Forest. During that period the
kickers have won three loop titles
and ﬁnished runiiereup three times.
With a big group of returning
players, Coach Hirsch has some tale
am With which to work. Throw in
one of the most talented freshmen
classes ever and the veteran may
mold another top-notch unit. “We
have zi lot of depth and some talented
young players," explained the coach.
Captains Zach Goldman, Seth
Kleilnan and Shawn Hoy all bring a
lot of experience to the squad.
Goldman Will be joined by allecone
fcrence performer Andy Lee in the
midfield. Rookies Steven Hailey-
Dunshealh and Justin Lea are vying
for time. Returning starter Warren
Morrow is joined by Luba Bululu
and rookies Jeff Zdtinek and Eli
Wood at the wing position.
Veterans Will Lee-Ashley and
Diniiter Georgiev will share time at
striker \vith Johll Paltnski and Nate
Quance,

Hoy, a twoeyear starter at goalie,
and Kleiman head up the defense.
Two-year starter Darren Bass is
joined by experienced players, JusV
tin Goot and Brian Vincente, to round
out the veterans. Rookie Joel Felkey
should also see some time on defense
while Davin Dahl and Vlill Love
have impressed Pfitsch in the goal.

“We had a lot of questions about
this team until we played our alumni
scrimmage on Sunday. Now I think

we have a grip on what all the fresh»
men can do," said Pfitsch. In three
halves of play the Pioneers tied the
alumni, 1—1, and won, 1-0 while the
varsity reserves fell, 0-1.

“I think we have a very talented
freshman unit. Also, our upperclassA
men have improved and are in great
shape. We have a very tough sched-
ule but this squad is very deep,
which should help us in the long
run," evaluated Coach Pfitsch.

David Arseneault, the Grinnell
College women’s tennis coach, ex-
pects an overall stronger team this
fall. With every player retumin g
from the 1996 squad, which posted
a 975 dual record and ﬁnished sev-
enth in the Midwest Conference, the
Pioneers are ready to open play this
Saturday at Lake Forest. The Pio—
neers then return home on Monday.
September 8 to face the always

fonnidibal Cornell sound.
Last fall the netwomen downed

the Foresters, 8» It “Because We
both have about the same teams re<
turning,“ said Arseneault, “I hope
we can get out of the gate with some
success. Our match against Cornell
marks the opening of our newly sur-
faced courts.“

Leading the charge are sopho-
mores Amy Kaufman and Aime
Hopper atNo. 1 and 2 singles Both
players got valuable experience in
those positions last year. “I think
Amy and Aime benefited from off-
season training. It certainly should
help their games this fall," noted the
coach.

Rookie Christine Calton has im»
pressed Arseneault and climbed to
the No. 3 singles position. The No.
3 and 4 players from ‘96, Beth
Dadko and Kim Knous, are battling
for the 4 and 5 slots while Cindy
Robbins should play No. 6.

“Obviously, by pushing three
players down,'we should be awfully
strong at the bottom of our lineup,"
commented Arseneaulti

It is a luxury fpr a coach to have
the same players two years in a row
so Arseneualt doesn't plan to mix
up his doubles teams. He‘ll play the
exact same lineup at 1996.
Kaufman and Dadko are slated at
No. l, Hopper and Knous at No. 2,
and Ryun Jun and Jeanie Mackenzie
at No. 3.

“I think these combos learned
their strengths and weaknesses last
fall. They should only get better and
better this year," said Arseneault.

The coach evaluated, “I think the
league is very strong at the top so
we may not make a huge move in
the standings. However, this is a
close~knit team which has improved
from last year and I look for us to
be strong.”
