To the Editor:

Open letter in response to our
October 17 letter concerning the
treatment of Grinnell women in the
3M3.

We feel that the true teelings and
aim of our letter have been ob-
scured by a lack of carelul reading
and comprehension on the part oi
Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Flinn, An
example oi such misinterpretation
is the accusation that we labeled
the author oi “Zanda” as “ab-
surd,” when our statement was
”the mere concept oi a typical
Grinnell female is absurd” We
resent the needlessly personal
reaction to our criticisms of those

perceptions oi Feminism which
were expressed in the “Zanda”
columns and |he editorial of Oc-
tober 10. We did not condemn the
authors of these articles, but
rather the limitations inherent in
lheir “liberal" View of the
women‘s movement. The articles
printed |hus lar in the S&B have
ignored the participation of many
Grinnell women in alternative
forms or political action. Perhap's
Mr. Flinn's lack oi knowledge
concerning the positive icminist
activity on campus is attributable
in part to the inadequate coverage
given to date by this paper.
Finally, we feel that the attempt

to discredit the Writers of the letter
as “frightened and insecure
women" rather than squarely
facing the issues we raised is a
typical reaction on the part of
traditionally oriented males who
have apparently yet to understand
the scope of Feminism. Such ate
tempts to discredit those with
alternative viewpoints rather than
dealing with the issues raised is a
Ilonrproductive form of debate. We
hope that in lhe future debate on
such issues can be more Con-
Structive.7T\\‘elll_\‘ “angry"
