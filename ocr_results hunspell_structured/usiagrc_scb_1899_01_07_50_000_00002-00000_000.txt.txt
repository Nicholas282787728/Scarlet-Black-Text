Qﬁhitorial

IF THERE is any time in the
yeztr‘ that society work ought to
ﬂourish it is in the winter term,
On the other tern‘lsi‘there is so
much attention given to athletics
and other things that compara-
tively little time is given to the
societies. This lack of interest
is partially excusable in the nth»
letes during the fall and spring
terms but not in those who do
not taken active part in athlete
ics. In the winter telm however.
there is practically-nothing to in
tetere with good.‘_consistent socir
ety work and we would urge all
who are not doing any, to take it
up immediately. Those who are
working in the societies could
well give more time and atten-
tion to this work. The fact that
the winter term is the only one
that is free from active athletics
and other attractions that impair
the quality of society work. is the
more reason thatispecial attention
should now be given to it. This
is undeniably the weakest depart
ment ot our college and it rests
entirely with the students to
strengthen it. We see no reason
why we should not have as good
work in societies as in the class
room or on the athletic ﬁeld. It
the students would realize that
they alone are responsible tor the
quality of this work: and deter-
mine to make a change in it, there
would be a marked improvement

in all the societies.

GRINNELL STUDENTS have ex-
ceptional opportunities of hearing
and meeting men and women who
are laboring toward the solving
of various social problems in this
country and in England. In Feb
ruary the Rand lectures will be
delivered by an Englishman. and
to-morrow afternoon and Monday
evening the students will be perr
mitted to hear Mrs. Florence
Kelly, ot Chicago. who wlli speak
along the line of child labor. For

tour years Mrs. Kelly held the

, position of factory inspector in

Illinois. which ls a political ofﬁce.
but is now in a Nanny in Chicago,
From the fact that Mrs. Kelly has
held such a position she is espeCr
ially well ﬁtted to talk on the sub
ject of child labor and no student
should deny himselt the privrlege
ot heaiing her.

Calocagarhla.

Calocagathia held her regular
literary program Friday afternoon
presided over by the new presi»
dent. Eleanors Morrison. The
musical part of the program con»
sisted of a comet solo by Mr.
Way. which was very enjoyable.

The subject of the afternoon
was "Women’s Clubs" and the
ﬁrst number was a talk by Miss
Lulu Kortz on the Development
of Clubs." giving a sketch ofthe
growth of the movement since its
beginning by Anne Hutchinson
She gave a very interesting ac-
count of the work of cifterent
clubs. Ada Garst told of the
public life of Mary Livermore,
her work among women and as a
lecturer which vocation she fol<
lowed for twenty-ﬁve years.
_Extemooroneousworkconsisted
of a talk byfiConstance Berry on.
"Club work as an aid to higher
education." This was Miss
Berry‘s ﬁrst appearance on the
society program and was very
creditable indeed.

Faith Douglass. who was a
member of Calocagathia for seVr
eral years, gave a very intereste

ing account ot the work she is do-
ing this year in a kindergarten
training school. The society was
very glad to have Miss Douglass
with them again.

Miss Kyle gave the critic's re»
port.

Miss Chamberlain will speak to
the society next Friday afternoon.
