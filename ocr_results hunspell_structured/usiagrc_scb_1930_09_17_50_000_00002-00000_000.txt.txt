NIGHT FOOTBALL A REALITY

Night football for Grinnell has been rcalized
this summer. and a week from Saturday the first
game will be played with Iowa Wcslcyan. Return—
ing students are pleased to see tllc pr cto crcct-
ed on \Vard field, and freshmen are impressed in
knowing that Grimlcll, the smallest college in the
Missouri Valley conference, is no longer the day~
light orphan lllcmbcr, and that by installing lights
it has made the playing of night football 100 per
cent ill the conference.

Coaches Truesdalc, Watt, and Duke have
Wanted night football at Grinllell since seeing the
success of the sport at other institutions. Tllc
lights now on IVard field were purchased and ill-
stalled under the management of the athletic dc-
partment, and with the increase in gate receipts,
the cost of about $3,000 will be paid out of thc ath-
letic budget.

Mr. Truesdale spent nluch time in collecting
data, which was responsible for the decision made
in favor of night football the middle of May. The
Scarlet and Black also suggested night football for
Grinncll, and received the cooperation of the ath-
letic department throughout the campaign.

Grillnell, and particularly its athletic staff,
are to be congratulated for equipping Ward field
for night football. The change meets the favor of
alumni and Grinncll merchants and townspeople.
The home football games of the Pioneers may now
be seen by Grinncll business people, who deserve to
watch the success of the 'enterprise which they will
help financially. '

Night football will mean much to Grinncll in
money. The glamor and color of the Pioneer
clashes on Ward field on autumn afternoons will
be lost, but in time a new glamor and color. and
an increase ill attendance, will compensate for the
change.

WELCOME

Newcomers, both freshmen and "transferring
students, Grinnell welcomes you. Fallowing your
soujourn here this first week, you will become an
integral part of the Grinnell college student body
and in that capacity a part of the institution itself.

Members of the class of 1934 will become
something more than a part of an ever continuing
parade of students, changing yearly, each group
striving to surpass its predecessor ill some manner.
They will become a part of that combination, so
distinctive at Grinnell, of all old traditions and
modern achievement.

It is significant that the oldest college west of
the Mississipp should be one of the first in‘tllat
same territory in installing gridiron floodlights.
Your work will aid in the continuance of that Grin-
ncll spirit, so desirable in the hustle and bustle of
today.

In a few days many of you will be engaged in
campus activities. Class work will be augmented

by atlllctics journalistic work, music, or drama.
Ill a few ' lrs you students will be called upon
to carry the torch of leadership ill these as well
as in scholarship w’llilc othcr llcwcomcrs, ‘ dis

NIGHT FOOTBALL FOR GRINNELL.

(From The scarlet and Black, March 8, 1930.)

Night football should be given a trial at Grinnell
college next fall. Afternoon games at Grinnell have
been losing money. and with only three home games out
of eight so for scheduled for the 1930 season, it is well
to consider the possibility of playing the Homecoming
game with Creighton university, Oct. 31, at night on
Ward field.

Griunell is the daylight orphan member of the
Missouri Valley conference in football. Drake univer-
sity was the only institution to have the “ow” sport
in the valley group when the gridiron season opaned
last fall, In two months three other Missouri Valley
members, Creighton university, Oklahoma Agricultural
and Mechanical college, and Washington university,
adopted night football, but Grinnell did not install
equipment and played in the afternoon its four home
games of the 1929 program.

Drake equipped its stadium for night football in
October, 1928, after consideration by Des Moihes busi~
ness men as well as by university authorities. The
successful experiences with night football of other
schools, which had suffered bankrupt athletic treasuries
from the sport when played in the afternoon at home,
was the outstanding argument for the night game at
Drake. Creighton, Oklahoma, and Washington found
afternoon football games on their local flelrls a. great
financial loss, and obtained economic salvation in night
playing.

Three athletic officials of three Missouri Valley
conference schools have voiced wishes that Grinnell
would give night football a. trial next fall, and the re-
maining official answered in the affirmative, but eon-
sldered it "s. question for the school itself." E. C. Lyt-
top, business manager of Drake; E. C. Gallagher,
athletic director of Oklahoma, and J. D. Braden of
Washington hope that the Pioneers will install night
football apparatus. while A. A. Schabinger, director of
athletics at Creighton, approved the proposal, but
thought the matter one for Grinnell to decide.

Night football equipment ,costs approximately
$3,500. Creighton and Drake spent that amount, while
Oklahoma. used $3,850 and Washington $5,000. With
out charging more for seats, the increase in the gate re~
celpts sufficed to pay for night football at all four
valley institutions. Twice as many people attended
night football games as attended afternoon contests at
Creighton, Drake, and Oklahoma, and three times as
many crowded into the stadium of Francis field at
Washington.

People who Work during the day Would‘be ablk to
see football games at Gr—innell, if they were played at
night. The business man and woman, the house wife
and the fan-oer would be able to attend night football
games. Alumni of Grinnell and residents in Des
Moines, Newton, Marshalltown, Oskaloosa. ottumwa.
and other central Iowa‘ cities would enjoy seeing
Creighton and Grinnell play football at night next fall.

Some manufacturers of floodlights for night foot-
ball are willing to send apparatus and to equip a field
for one game at night on approval. The Creighton-'
Grinnell game next fall, which will he the Homecoming
contest, would be an ideal one to use as a subject for
testing attendance and gate receipts.

Couch Schabinger of Creighton. director of athletics
and head basketball coach, would like particularly to
see the Creighton-Grinnell game played at night. He
stated, "It is only natural that 1 should like to see the
Creighton»Grinnell football game at Grinnell Oct. 31,
1930. played at night because I believe the receipts
will be considerably larger."

Grinnell should give night football a. trial at the
1930 Homecoming game, and if it is successful, install
permanent equipment and arrange a good schedule of
home night ‘games for the fall of 1931.

Night football at Glinnell would make the playing
of the “ow " sport 100 per cent in the Missouri Valley
conferenceko. distinction which might be without pre-
cedent in the United States by next fall.

THE THIRTY-SEVENTH MANAGEMENT.

(From The Scarlet and Black, April 19, 1930.)

“The Scarlet and Black will advocate during the
coming year the equipping of Ward field with lights for
night football at Grinnell. such a stand will be stress-
ed particularly in regard to having the Homecoming
game with Creighton university next fall at night."

Glee Clubs Open

The Women's Athletic association
encourages all frehman girls to take

teams have often come off the vic-
tors. Hiking, swimming, tennis and
fencing are also open to freshmen.
Membership in the w.A.A. is gained
by points won in these sports, and
the winning of class numerals and
letters by the accumulation of these

 

points is also a spur.

The men’s and Women’s glee clubs,
which hold a prominent place in earn-
pus activities, hold tryouts soon after
the beginning of school in which sev-
eral freshmen usually are successful.
The college band and orchestra offer
an opportunity for any who play mu~
sical instruments.

Chances to Debato

Dramaties at Gnnnell holds many

ent.

In debating Grinneu offers advan—
tages which all freshmen are urged
to take each year. The Merrill debate
series is open to all freshmen, and
