Valley Trelkmen
Will Compete Here

IContlnued From Page 1)

Drake will probably take the pole-
vault with Lansrude doing the high
work. while Miller of Washington
and Collins of Drake battle for sec-
ond place in the event. All of these
men are experts and should provide
some stiff competition. All three are
able to top thirteen feet easily, and
Lansrude has neared the fourteen
foot mark when pushed.

Mcllrath of Grinnell is easily the
class of the mile, but Collins and
Jenkins of the oklahoma Aggies
will push him for the other places,
and no other Pioneer is likely to
gather points in that event, Mur-
phy and Hugh Edwards of Grinnell
placed one, two in the half-mile of
the indoor meet, beating out Burch
of the Oklahoma Aggies and Mus-
grave of Drake. Burch may be able
to take Murphy on the outdoor
path, however, while Gordon of
Drake demonstrated his superiority
in that field in the Drake-Grinnell
dual this spring, Cordon took the
ado-yard event at the outdoor meet
in stillwater last spring. He is also
a good quarter-mile man, however,
and if Coach Johnson runs him in
that event it does not seem likely
that he will take part in the half-
mile.
Grinnell Favored in 440.

Grinnell's battery of quarter-mil-
ers, led by Captain Mark and Pel-
letier. should break the tape in the
quarter-mile, although Gilmore of
the Bears does the distance in :50
or better. Jenkins of Oklahoma Ag-
gies will probably nab the tw0~mile
event as he did in the indoor ses-
sion, with Secor and Pye of Grinnell
pushing him. Monrath. in addition
to running the mile, will probably
take part in either the two-mile or
the half-mile for Crinneu.

The majority of field events will
find Washington university almostl
without competition. Miller will
‘push Lansrude ‘ill the pole-vault.
'wllile Weber,'Timberlake and Poos
will work in the high-jump: Doug-
las trimmed the Washington jump-
ers at st. Louis last Saturday, but
Weber does six. feet consistently,
making it appear that Douglas will
have a tough job repeating here.
Timberlake and Pans of Washington
are scheduled to take the broad-
jump, the former ranking as one of
the best in the midwest with one
leap of 24 feet 3 inches this season.

Pioneer Relay Team Good.

Grimell’s mile relay team
composed of Thomas, Edwards,
Pelletier, and Mark. is scheduled to
’60}: its event, with Drake's unit of
Musgrave, McClelland, Brooks and
’Gordon favored for second. The
Creighton relay team of Barron,
Binder, Allison and Turner, which
was second at the indoor fracas, will
probably not compete.

’Consunt improvement during the
:regular playing seasons has given
~Crinnell an even chance to take one
of the Missouri Valley tennis titles
'here this week-end. when the confer-
ence netsters compete. Coach Trues-
dale plans to enter a four-man team,

To the Editor of
Black:

The article about the Liberal club
in Monday's Des Moines Register
was not only unauthorized by Lyle
Shelmidine, but was printed without
his knowledge. It resulted from an
informal conversation between a lo-
cal representative of The Register
and Mr. Shelmidine.

1 do not wish to criticize the over-
zealous journalist who manufactur-
ed quotations to suit his needs, but
I want to insist that neither the pre-
sident of the Liberal club nor the
club itself is seeking publicity. lln-
fortunately. neither can protect itself
against irresponsible journalism.

However, H. W. Matlack's diatribe
on the “youngsters more eager for
notoriety than for facts” certainly
justified such a reply. The prohibi-
tion poll was carefully and honestly
conducted, and the results were is-
sued not to please any particular
group. but as the facts themselves.

It is signiﬁcant to note, that while
we are attacked locally as "wet" and
radical, we are regarded in the East
as “dry" and reactionary. It is folly
to attempt to please everyone. The
ultras of the right and the left will
never be satisﬁed. Let me recom-
mend to Mr. Matlack his own cau-

The Scarlet and

startling revelation."
