with six wins and one loss as
compared to the eight wins and
one loss established by Ripon, the

Opposition Weak.
Neither of the two opponents of
the Grinncll team can be con-
sidered very serious threats, for
Beloit, having _won only one of
its last mi-ee games, is resting in
fifth place, and Lawrence is down
in the cellar position with Knox.

Beloit lost to Cornell, 23 to as,
and Coe, 33—45, on its trip into
Iowa, and then defeated Lawrence
in Wisconsin, 32 to 22, Lawrence
Won its only conference game this
season from Knox last Saturday'
night, 36-25.

Lineup Given.

Grinnell's probable starting line-
up includes Captain James Nash
and Harold Kendall at forward,
Eugene Peisner at center, and
Jerry Fort and Stan Zahllcr in
the guard positions. Fred Rails-
back will probably see plenty of
action at guard in the games.

Lawrence will probably start
Frank Hammer and Frederickson
at forward, .Cnpe at center, and
Bucsing and Smith as guards.
Hammer and Frederickson are the
main scoring threats for the Law-
rence team.

Probably They Haven’t! Been Told of Grinnell Examinations
But Students from Slovakia and Austria Want to Enroll

 

By Clyde Bales,

Though it may seem incongruous
to Gi-innell students who still rc-
l‘anbel' the recent exams, there
are persons from such places as
Hlohvec, Slovakia, and Vienna,
Austria, who would like to enroll
here.

Applications for admission to
Giinnell have been received from
Votjech Goldstein, who is now live
ing in Hlohvec, and Alfred Pom-
mer, who came to this country
last March from Austria. Gold—
stein, 19 years old, has been at-
tending the state Slovak sec—
ondary school at Hlohvec. Puma
mer, 23, is a former student at
the University of Vienna,

Goldstein, who is particularly
interested in languages, stated in
his correspondence with Waldemar
Hagen, director of admissions,

that he would like to become an
engineer or a business man. This
ambition is statcd along with the
information that, he, Goldstein,
can speak Slovak, German, Eng—
lish, French and Hungarian. The
Slovak student also stated that
he know Latin well.

Goldstcin's transcript, which is
presented in two languages, Slo—
vak and English, was received by
Hagen December 6, 1939, after a
month's time had clasped siiiee
mailing.

Goldstein said in his letter, “As
for the admission, let me know
as soon as possible since it re—
quires six to eight months to get
out of the countr " Goldstein's
college expenses are to be financed
by relatives living in this country,
according to information received
by Hagen,

1 Alfred Poinmer wrote Hagen
ifrom Chattanooga, Tennessee,
where he is now employed at a
chemical company, after first
working in a dye laboratory there,
Polilmal"s interests are primarily
scientific. He wants to bccomc a
chemist, according to Hagen's in-
formation. His stiidies at Vienna
included chemistry, botany, math—
ematics and philosophy.

In his correspondence with
Hagen, Pommer sai “In the fall
(19377 I served three months with
the Austrian army as required
I returned to the University of
Vienna for the summer semester
of 1938, but three weeks later
Austria was annexed by the Ger—
man Reich, and new legislation
made it impossible for me to

stay."
