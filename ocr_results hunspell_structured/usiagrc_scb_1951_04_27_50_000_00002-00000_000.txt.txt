Hawk Announces
Possible Raise

In College Tuition

“Tuition has not been oiiic.
ially raised.‘ It is my considered
opinion that a thirty dollar a
year raise will be voted at the
trustees’ meeting June 4," treasa
urer Rupert Hawk stated Wed-
nesday.

In replying to the rumors oi
issuance oi letters concerning
faith payments to be followed
by letters oi tuition raises, Mr.
Hawk emphasized that no de»
ception is being practiced by
the administration. An upping
of the fees simply has not yet
been voted. A thirty dollar raise
would put Grinnell on par with
Carleton, Pomona, Denison, and
other colleges similar in size and
nature.

That raise would not be suf-
ficient to cover the increased
costs at today's inflation rate,
Mr. Hawk said, but because of
competition w i t h schools
throughout the country, Grin.
'nell, like the others, is obliged
to keep fees at the same level
as theirs. It is hoped the dif-
ferences can be made up in
gifts and savings in non—educa-
tional parts at the budget.
