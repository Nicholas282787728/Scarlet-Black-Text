Kissane recalled

BOB Noyce, an upperclassman
at Grinnell in Kissane‘s time. was
once expelled wnh another student
for stealing a pig and slaughtering it.

Kissane said. though he wasn‘t sure
about which dorm. The pig was
supposed to have been eaten in a
banquet. The famier who owned the
pig was not amused and insisted that
the two boys be punished. hence the
expulsion.

Noyce was the focus ofanother
of Kissalic's fond memories. Noyce
seemed so terribly bright. Kissane
said, that he never had to do anything
in their French class. Kissanc said he
once saw Noyce catch a bee. tie a
thread to its leg and fly it around the
room.

Noyce once expelled from Grinnell

days Kissanc remembers a prol’
named Fred Bowman. he said. who
was “a holy terror” and “scared the
living whatever out of students."
Kissane described Bowman as
“fierce" and “irasciblc.”

One student kept a collection of
“Bowmanisms” 7 striking quotes
from Professor Bowman during lccr
turcs (apparently the prof quote idea
now on Grinncll's VAX system isn't
all that new). Klssnnc said that most
students were “able to enjoy the cor
canrlcltiesofsuchfaculty members."
A few years later. Kissanejomcd the
Grim-tell faculty while Bowman was
stillatGrinnell and afterthat.i(issane
said.Bowman turned out to be“a big
teddy bear."

GRINNELL‘S first hippie,
Kissane said, was Terry Blsson. a
freshman from Kentucky in the early
19603. Kissane recalled that he was
sitting at his desk at the beginning of
the year and looked out his window
only to ﬁnd a long»halred male slur

said he remembers thinking to hime

‘M beginning to think that a
I Grinnell education is a waste of

money for many students. At
least half of the classes I have taken
so far have tried to teach me one
major point. It’s lucky for me thatI
have learned this point. A lot of
students I have encountered have no
idea what it is,

The lesson was ﬁrst taught to
me by my tutorial professor. Ira
Strauber. In my tutorial. we read
opposing opinions on conLroversia]
issues. I learned the lesson best
through the debate on ﬂag burning.
Before reading the text. I believed
that flag burning isaright protected
under the first amendment. and that
the people in favor of ﬂag protec-
tion are unpatriotic 7 they believe
in protecting a cloth over protecting
democratic principles. SLrauber as?
signed us the majority and dissent-
ing Supreme Court decisions on the
famous Texas v. Johnson flag burns
ing case After reading both deci-
sions and debating them in class. I
came to realize that ﬂag protectionr
ists are not unpatriotic. To people
who believe ﬂag burning is notpro—
tected speech, flag burning amounts
to “fighting words" and has the pOr
tential to cause physical harm. Even
though my opinion on the issue
didn’t change, I had new insight,

Iliad learned the lesson. Inow
know that there are two sides to
every issue Neitherside is right or
wrong. Individuals must look at an
issue and determine whether the
means are worth the ends. and
whether the ends are better than the
status quo. Each issue has warts
The question is, do you accept the
issue. warts and all?

 

——Current—~

Last week. Sports Editor Chris
Pallas wrote an editorial in which he
stated that the means and ends of
multiculturalism, as implemented at
Grinnell. are not worthy of being
practiced 7 the warts are too ugly.
His argument was reasonable. It’s
an argument that has been made
before about similar
multiculturalismprograms. Ididn’t
agree with it. Although i would
make a few changes in the current
system. I believe that
multiculturalism as practiced at
Grinnell lSJuSliﬁed, warts and all.

It has been a week since Pallas
wrotethe editorial. During the week,
Pallas has been told a number of
different ridiculous things and been
called aracist. People havejustiﬁed
this statement through a phrase
Pallas used in his piece which was
obviously hyperbole. Call'ngPailas
a racist is weak. Polit ians call
each other names. Students involve
themselves in scholarly debate.

Letmeputitanotherway. What
ifPallas were black? Would he sLlll
be a racist? Supreme Court Justice
Clearance Thomas is black. and his
viewson manyracialissuesaresimi-
lar to the views Pallas has. ls Clears
ance Thomas a racist? No. His
views are merely different than the
viewsmostpeople have atGrinnell.

This week, on page 9. Pallas
has written another editorial on the
subject. His points are once again
valid,and youshould eonsiderthem.
I did. and I still disagree with him.
Yet Pallas and I can debate the sub-
ject without calling each other
names.

In ourmulticulturalcampus.we
can acceptavariety ofcultures. Why
can‘t we also accept a variety of
views?

who emailed Charnock to get his name
iakenoffthemailinghst. said. “Link
is a big waste of paper and of
mailrooni space."

The cover ofLirik contains a
$2.95 price tag. This feature has
also irked students because no
one who receives Link actually
paysforit. The pricetagsuppos~
edly represents the value of the
magaeine, but critics deny that
Link lS worth anywhere near the
list price Charnock responded
to complaints about the price by
saying that its omission was a
future possibility.

Some Grinnellians. already
bombarded by ads aimed at the col~
loge market. scc Link as yet another
tool of corporations. Charnock an-
swclcd charges of being overly ad-
vertisement-focused with the inforr

- matron that Link has an ad to copy

ratio of 25:75. His assertion was
that the advertisers were necessary
to allow Link to be distributed free to

college students with tight budgets.
“They're picking up the tab. but we
don‘t cater to them," he said.
Students who are unhappy with
Link are starting to get the message
out that they can do something about
it to other students , Junior Xander
Jacobs dedicated an issue of his
newsletter-like publication, The
SHIT. to Link (“Number 16 was the
Corporate Lovc issue." he said) and
included Charnock's email address
for interestedstudcnts. Currently, a
ﬁle called ”Link suckSrRead me"
can be found on the Common win
dow of campus Macintosh comput-
ers. This ﬁle consists of all the
communications between Stern and
Charnock, and may be of interest to
students wanting to find out what
Link’s editor has to say about the
concerns expressed by students.
Anyone who Wishes to be taken
off of Link's mailing list or would
like to communicate with Mr.
Charnock can c-mail him at
