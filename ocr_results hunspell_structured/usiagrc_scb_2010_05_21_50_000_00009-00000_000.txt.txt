Applebaum focused on chess, CS

If you’ve ever played chess outside the Grill on Wednesday
nights, you may have met Andrew Applebaum ’10, who runs the
club. Applebaum, who lives in Chicago, took over the club after
Klaus Johnson ’07 graduated, setting up the Wednesday night
matches in order to revitalize cluh membership.

“The general consensus 1 got was a lot otpcople know how to
play. not a lot have the
time or the interest to
commit themselves to
anything," Applebaum
said.

Applebaum came
to crinnell thinking
he would major in
mathematics or biology,
hecause these were subjects he enjoyed and tesred well for.

“What I’d really liked about bio was micro stuff viruses,
bacteria. 1 really got a kick out of diseases. Yeah, it's a weird thing
to say. But I’d read T12: Hal Zone. It was about Ebola, and it was
like the most interesting thing I remembered from high school.”

Luckily for him,a bad pre»regislration group number prevented

him from taking any biology courses his first semester, After talking

to his adviser,he took computer science and stuck with it, declaring
his major soon thereafter.

His second semester, Applebaum got a radio show on KDIC
that he maintained for seven semesters,which,while attracting few
listeners,helpecl him to improve his public speaking skills to such a
degree that, while raking Craft ofArgumcm, he received a positive
presentation score on a speech project.

Looking back, he regrets not playing more sports while
at Grinnell. In high school he played football, mostly as a
benchwarmer, and decided not to continue it when he arrived at
college.

"I don't imagine," Applebaum said. "I would've played it
would've been good for me physically, because I’m clearly out of
shape, and I've been out ofshape for a while."

In his sophomore year he attempted to pick up the sport again,
but quit after playing one day, saying “it had been too long."

The past summer he did a MAP to develop games for teaching
statistical concepts. The MAP consisted of designing games that
incorporated a statistical concept into the gameplay, and allowing
students to change variables at will to conduct experiments.

Applebaum intends to go to graduate school at the University
ofCallfornia at Davis to pursue a PhD. in computer science.
