Em'rons Scam. '1' AND BLACK —
A few words may not be out or
place as to piepaialion for the
home orzttorical contest urrrlymr.
This CVCllt seems a great way off.
and it may perhaps appear-
reasonable that attent on be cailr
ed to it at this early date. but ne
ought to have learned by the ere
perience of the past years that we
are matching ourselves 'against no
unworthy opponents in the state
oraioiical contest. Our home
contest tI :jyear was rather a poor
showing ior Iowa College. and
the explanation may be found
partly in the fact that all but the
winning oration were written hur-
riedly. and had received only a
small shale of the time and hard
work essential to produce a ﬁn-
islictl oration. So in this winter
term it behooves those who have
any thought of entering the cone
test next year to begin reading.
and it possible to pursue studies
along the line of the subject they
have chosen. thatby the ﬁrst of
next fall teini they may be ready
to begin writing their production.
Oratory is an art which it is well
worth otll while as students to
cultivate. A SUBSCRIUER.
