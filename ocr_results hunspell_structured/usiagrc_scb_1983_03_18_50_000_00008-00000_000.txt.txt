A very respectable major

Wednesday aiternoon i switched on my
radio and heard KDIC's question ior this
week: What major do you have the least
respect for? The men and women “on the
street" responded by naming several dii-
ierent majors, American Studies more
than once. What distubed me was not the
mere mention oi this estimable major, but
the pure disgust and loathing with which
the words were uttered. i hadn’t realized
the contempt with which American Studies
majors, aiiectionateiy referred to as Aiii.
studs. among selective upper class mar
jors, are held on this campus But, really,
American Studies is worthy oi a lot oi
respect,

Oh. sure, I know all the complaints
against us; you can‘t have been an Am

 

 

Stud. for three years and have escaped the
usual ribbings. There are those who say we
have no discipline, I haven’t yet
discovered whether or not we have our
own particular discipline, but we sure
spend a lot oi time learning other peoples'.
As near as I can tell, we have to learn the
methodologies of anthropology, sealology,
psychology, statistics, and political
science, and I'm sure I've missed a few.
We combine all thesqwhich is very dfficult
and confusing at best. Besides that, we
have discipline in another sense of the
word being willing and able to endure two
siminars instead of one, We must also
complete 36 credits. That's {our more
credits than most majors have

Anyway, what is more important than
the study of the American Culture, for

those of us who live in it? Students of this
culture put together all oi the smaller com-
ponents oi knowledge, gathered by other
majors, ior the big picture. We splice
together the frames of film containing
iragments oi American life to make the en-
tire movie. or course now they use video
tape, but it is still, I think an apt analogy,
‘ Another overt example oi American
studies phobia (and I assert that ye iearoi
our extraordinary intellectual prowess
which produce such animosity tappears in
the column by Bob Kleine in lastwecks
Scarlet and Black. Mr. Kleine drew a
parellel between American Studies and
free eveings. This assumption seems to me
a clear case oi jealousyrdiwAmericn
studies majors have more iree time than
other students, a iact which needs to be

empirically supported, it is simply
because we “have it all together." The
courses required for our major are not
particularly easy, but we just chose a
major ior which our interest is so great
that the learning comes easily

Finally, the American Studies major
does great service to the college, We Ins
elude fellow travelers in our EPC den
tivities and enroll them in our seminars,
thereby sharing our knowledge with as
many students as possible. We're not
stingyAnd who else provides wincilots oi
wmel and cheese at their colloquiumSl?

Next time someone asks you the major
you have the least respect for at Grinnell,
think twice rhetore you say American
studies. And please, keep the disgust out
of your voice.

 

On the issue of racism

This column is a commentary on the are
ticle in the Scarlet and Black (Vol. 91, N0.
2]) “Shades of Racism: The covert, the
blatantv the problem exists.” My main
criticism centers on the topics of hostility
and “liberalness” set forth in the article,
Well, what exactly is “liberalness”?
Karen Ellison attempts to define it in the
following manner: “Many oi these people
(students) claim to besa ‘liberal'. The ma»
jority oi them certainly don't reflect this in
any way other than that they coexist in
Grinnell with us (balck students), That's
real ‘liberalness,’ ” (noted sarcasm)

I think what Ellison means by
“liberalness” is one's ability to accept and
integrate with those people oi other races.
she also speaks of “sophisticated
racism” — meaning what? I think she
refers to the “subtle yet apparent” hostilir
ty which the nonrblack community directs
toward the black community at this col~
lege. If this is the conditon to which she
refers. then Ialso think that she needs to

be corrected. The hostility is by no means
unidirectional — it is rather a hostility bet.
ween the two mentioned groups.

A question which is often posed is how
did this ”hostility" begin? Unfortunately,
I have no answer, perhaps because there is
no real answer, and this question is not
representative oi the real problem, The
problem is how do we end die “hostility"
something with which the article tails to
deal. But perhaps the article ignores the
aiorementioned issue at this point because
there exists no real solution.

Technically, blacks, as well as other
minorities (such as myself), possess in
some ways more advantages than the
white majority in the farm of Affirmative
Action/Equal Opportunity programs. The
rest of the minority problem lies in at-
titudes and opinions. And what do we do
about that? “Educate" those who are
discriminatory? If so, then how? Will we
“program" them into believing all people

Samuel Cbun

are the same? That would be absurd. As
Monica Leonard stated, “Well of course
l’m different." Well, of course we are all
different, none of us are exactly alike. And
I feel that our individual differences far
outweigh our general similarities. So there
will always be some discrimination.

what is my point then? My point is that
certain ethnic minorities are, at times,
somewhat hypersensitive toward racism;
perhaps they see so much racism because
they specifically look for it. Maybe they
should try to see things trom a more objec
tive standpoint rather man a defensive
one. If this stance is taken, they will still
find racism, but perhaps not as much as
they might otherwise expect,

1 once attended a cos party which was
advertised as being an ‘allcampus' event.
when I attended, 1 was promptly greeted
with “looks and jeers”. i can only conclude
that this reception was due L1 the fact that
I am not black. Likewise, I seldom see the
majority of the black community make a

conscious eiiort to socialize with the rest oi ’
the school. This behavior in itself is of no
consequence. However, I think it to he un-
just and hypocritical for members of the
black community to criticize the nonrblack
community ior something die majority oi
the blacks themselves indulge in, Ellison
states, ”I'm disillusioned with Grinnell, I
expected it tO’he more liberal.” My reply
to that is do not expect everyone else to be
“liberal" when you yourseli are not, ior
that, Ms. Ellison, is true hypocrisy.

My final point is that the black come
munity seems to isolate itself as much as
the non-black group does, and blame rests
clearly on both sides. 01’ course, this state-
ment is a generalization, and 1 know that
there are people who stand as exceptions
to my claims. To these people i sincerely
apologize. This article may, in all pro-
bability, anger certain people. But that is
not my intent, it is merely a by product or
free speech.

 

Benefitting from Penetration...

Uniortunately, the concept oi “group,"
when applied to blacks at Grinnell, oiten
assumes some negative connotations that
would not and could not be as readily im-
plied about whites. This assertion has been
made upon the sight oi a group or blacks in
the Pub, in the Forum and in the dining
halls. It is a frequently-made contention
that because oi the propensity or some
blacks on this campus to collect at certain
times, and thus to become a group, images
at separatism, impenetrability and even
racism are projected. Well, upon a little
deliberation, one may be surprised at the
actual motives that can underlie the ap-
parent “groupiness” of black students on
Grinnell's campus. Rather than only con-
sider what seems “obvious" to some, be-
ing the propagation by blacks of
separatism, impenetrability and racism
when iound in groups, why not also eXr
amine me total context of the situation at
hand? In other words, try to be a little
more objective and thoughtful. Probe the
situation to aiiord yourself “represen-
tative accuracy" of the scene at hand. You
see, insight remains a poweriui determi-
nant oi race relations on this campus,
especially in an effort to highlight the in-
Substantiality oi the Careless criticisms
made about this black “groupiness.”

' The dinner period is a prime opportunity

page 8 Scarlet and Black March 18, 1983

to see the phenomenon or black
“groupiness.” Supposedly, this
phenomenon oi separatism, impentrabiii-
ty and even racism. it is not uncommon
that a group oi blacks collect over a range
or one or two tables in order to enjoy one
another's presence at a meal, Dinner is
designed in part to be a time to release ten~
sions, to discuss activities or the past day
as well as plans for the future and to
assemble thoughts to execute the duties of
the evening. Aiter an active, challenging
day 7 or even after a day spent in relaxa»
tiori e it is not beyond comprehension that
a person may desire the company of those
with whom he shares some degree or
mutual comfort. White students do it all
the time — and they are not, interestingly
enough, accused of possessing such
negative intentions as are blacks. So why
are not blacks afforded the same base to
enjoy a meal, as a group, in the company
of their preference, without provoking
such destructive, mindless reactions as
are often incurred? These are ﬁle type of
reactions that contribute to the intensity
and augmentation of racist sentiments on
Grinnell's campus, People are people 7
that is basic enough. Mutual interests can
be found to exist among blacks as well as
whites and anyone else. These mutual in-
terests can emerge among several people

regardless of secondary (actors such as
race and can provide the foundation for a
group.

This incohgruity oi standards, which is
what the situation undoubtabiy reduces
itself to, illuminates yet another occur-
rence that has for a while been con-
spicuous to the more adamant ponderers
of race relations in Grinnell. More times
than not, it appears as ii the black student
is expected, though tactily, to designate
the extent or rapport between himseli and
nonblacks, Several of the more outspoken
nonblacks have provided this input in an
effort to allevtate perceived racial bar-
riers in Grinnell. What this translates into
is that in many cases, the black is ap-
parently expected to make the greater et-
fort in order to give the nonblacks student
the “go ahead." This is unfortunate, but
realistic.

Mutual interests generate groups. The
trequency of this assertion qualifies it as a
universally applicable social code. There
is nothing wrong with one who gravitates
towards those with whom he shares a
mutual interest and mutual understanding
A within whatever framework these
elements may present themselves.
However, it is logically deducible that
because a group forms, there are many
possible reasons to explain why these pew

'pie in particular term a group. Similarly,
it is quite possible that blacks on the carn-
pus do not exhibit “groupy” tendencies
which stem from desires to convey
separatism, impenetrability or racism.
But, perhaps it is because some blacks
have grown tired or deiining parameters to
everyone — excluding those nonhlacks
who initiate effort and possess the con—
fidence, and thus the comfort, to immerse
themselves in a group of blacks. Blacks
immerse themselves in nonblack groups
on a regular basis. Maybe these nonblacks
have realized Ute sillinesss of the conten-
tion that groups of blacks mean to send out
vibrations of “non-entry to nonblacks." It
should be obvious that blacks desire to in
teract with fellow Grinnellians, because
there are certainly predominantly black
institutions Where the Same amount of
academic effort can have the same results
for black students. And even if one is not
interested in becoming immersed in a
group of blacks for social stimulation, one
should consider the mechanics of this ap-
parent “groupiness” before one asserts
separatism, impenetrabiiity or racism as
the underlying motivation. It would cer—
tainly make things much more pleasant
for those who have found otherwise, as
well as for blacks who are just as entitled
to enjoy "groupiness."
