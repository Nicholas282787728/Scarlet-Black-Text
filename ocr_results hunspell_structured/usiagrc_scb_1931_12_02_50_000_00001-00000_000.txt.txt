Wood Explains
Point of View
of Humanism

Norman Foerster to Speak
on Goethe, Humane

Letters Here

By PAUL SPENCER \VOOD
(Professor of English)

Professor Norman Foerster, Dean
of the College of Letters. the Uni-
versity of Iowa, who speaks at 8 pm.

' Friday, Dec, 4, is Herrick chapel, on
“Goethe and Humane Letters Today"
is a prominent exponent of the New
Humanism. ‘

Among the controversies of the
past few years which have been most
fiercely waged and have excited most
interest among thinking people is the
battle over the New Humanism. Into
a world dominated by the more ex-
treme new movements in art and let—
ters, where the eccentric and the
fantastic have run riot as never be-
fore, have come the New Humanists
with their insistence upon normality
and universality. Against the popular
belief in universal relativity and um
restrained individualism they have
championed definite standards of
judgment: against a "creative" criti-
cism they have set up a judicial
criticism.

”Is It Worth Doing?"

In addition to the two questions
asked by the appreciative criti :
“What has the artist tried to do?"
and “How well has he done it?“ they
have asked the third question, “Ii. it
worth doing?” and have frequently
answered in the negative. 1

While much contemporary art Cour
centrates attention upon mere feeling
for ideas, Humanism endeavors to
restore the balance. It values propor-
tion and moderation, and it believes
that even the modern world can learn
much from the past. It is little con-
cerned with the art of savages or the
productions of children, but is inter-
ested rather in the best and most
representative productions of the
most gifted men.

Locks Popular Faith

In life the Humanist rejects the
theory that We should all follow our
impulses, he holds rather that our
first duty is to know the best. and
our second is by self-discipline to
make it fruitful in our lives. In so~
ciety he distrusts the uplifter and the
reformer who tries to do good to
‘people in the mass. The reform in
which he is first interested is self-

Thomas Classy

Thomas was without a doubt the
classiest player in the conference, a
brilliant passer and broken field
runner, a smart field general, and a
good kicker. He figured in every one
of Grinnell’s touchdowns during the
year, a record almost unparalleled
anywhere. Because of his splendid
all-around play, he is awarded the

First Meeting Thursday,
Open to All

Grlnnell College's Young Men’s
Christian association, heretofore
theoretically including in its member
ship every man in school, will re—
organize into a definite group, known
as the Tri—Shlp at the Associations’
building tomorrow night. This will

serve as a compact group within the
larger organization.

imately 50 Grinnell men who regular—
ly have evinced an interest in the
things for which the Tri-Ship stands,
fellowship, sportsmanship, and citi»
zenship, inv ing them to membership.

interested, however, without any
charge.

”In an effort to give the Y. M. c, A.
a pledge or purposeful membership,"
Fillmore GwynnerVaugnan, president,
said today, “the cabinet and advi
ors of the group decided upon this
new organization.

”The loose organization of the as—
sociation has made the work increas-
ingly difficult. With this comparative
ly compact group, the three-fold pur-
post which leads to the name, Ti
Ship, can be carried on w. h more
efficiency."

mediately following.

Due to lack of organization of the
teams, it is difficult to pick the favor-
ite, but the freshmen who always of—
fer the most distinct threat are
strong this year. The seniors, headed
by Patsy Ferrara, all~dormitory for»
ward, will make a bid for the title
which they almost annexed last year.

The class of 1933 has won the
tourney twice in succession and will
make a strong bid for its third

Trio of Pioneers Win Places
on Register’s Mythical Team

Three Grinnell gridmen, Captain
Oscar Christoffersen, center: Hank
Thomas, quarterback, and Duncan,
end, were placed on the Des Moines
Register’s all-Missouri Valley confer-
ence football team.

concerning the work of Thomas.
the sports writer said, “Thomas, the
Grinnell quarterback, the best man
in this position in this section, won
his place without opposition. He is
probably the fastest man in‘ Iowa or
in the conference who wore football
pads this year and in addition is more
than an excellent passer. In an open
field he is a wonder. The Grinnell
star also knows how to run a team
to get the best of results. He is a
gambler and the unexpected is the
thing he tries.
