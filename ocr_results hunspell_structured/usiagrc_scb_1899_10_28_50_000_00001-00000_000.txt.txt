New Series.

Grinneli Institute.

The excellent work done by the In
stitute this year is a marked improve-
ment over last, and the large rnrmber
regularly attending our meetings euA
courages those on the program to a
higher standard of work.

Mr. McFarland opened the program
with a brief summary of the leading
events of the week, followed by a well»
prepared paper by McCullom. Evans’
talk on the Slst lowa showed he had
followed closely the Iowa boys in the
Philippines. Dickinson’s reading was
the best the society had heard for some
time. His pronunciation of the negro
dialect was excellent.

The Instituters are always grateful
to orrtsiders who favor the society with
selections from work in which they
have special talent. This was clearly
shown after Miss Corrrtney had given
her ﬁrst selection. She responded to
the encore with another well-rendered
selection. lt rs hoped the society may
have‘the pleasure of listening to Miss
Courtney again.

The extemporaneous work was done
by Messrs. Nollen, Harris and Thomp—
son, followed by the regular debate, on
the question, “Resolved: That the
pooling of railroads when restricted by
the Inter-state Commerce Commis-
sion slrorrld be permitted.” 'The af-
firmative was defended by McNett,
and the negative by Blatherwick. The
judges gave the decision in favor of
the afﬁrmative.

The Orinnell Institute hold their
meeting on every Wednesday night, at
7:30, to which everyone is invited.
Our attendance has been large and our
programs of a high order. On no
evening has our attendance fallen be-
low ﬁfty, arid it has been as high
as one hundred and twenty-ﬁve. We

very much regret to say that no mem-
ber of the faculty has attended our
meetings.

Those who give the programs in the
future should remember that with a
frrll membership and good crowds, the
society demands the very best they
have to give.

Ellls,

The meeting of the Ellis society
Friday afternoon was opened by a
vocal solo by Miss Brownell, Fol»
lowing the roll call Ella Mehlin gave
a short talk on Lafayette’s inﬂuence
in the French revolution, speaking
chiefly of his intlueuce in quieting
mobs and his protection of the king
and the royal family.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL.

Dorothea Nath’s paper upon the
Jacobius was especially commendable
because of its style and the ease and
interesting manner of its delivery.
She spoke of the origin of the clrrb,
being one of the three clubs into which
the National Assembly was resolved,
and receiving the name or Jacobin
from the establishment or its head
quarters in a Dominican (Jacobin)
monastery. After the entire control
of affairs had come into their hands,
the royal family were disposed of, and
jealousies among themselves resulted
in the gaining of power by Robes»
pierre. With the popular demand for
his death and hrs execution ended the
rule of the Jacobins and the night of
the Reign of Terror.

A brief account of the influence of
the mobs in these troublous times by
Emma Johnson, was followed by an
Externporaneous debate upon the sub-
ject, Resolved: That the collective
ownership of resources and means of
production is the best solution of the
social problems of the nation. The
aﬁﬁrmative was supported by Fannie
Finer and Flora Allison, the negative
by Susie Orvis and May McClanna-
hair. The arguments on both sides
were so well presented that it was dit-
ﬁcult to arrive at a decision, but one
was ﬁnally pronounced in favor of
the negative.

Calocagathia.

Calocagathia’s program opened with
a vocal solo by Mrs. Heidel, who gra-
ciously responded to an encore. /\
study of artists of the Renaissance
was given as follows:

Leonardo da Vince’s career, not
only as a painter and sculptor, but
also as poet, architect and engineer,
was reviewed in a very interesting
manner by erverrr Richards.

Jane Fulton followed with a sketch
of Venice as a ﬁtting introduction to
her discussion of Titian, the greatest
of the Venetian school. She spoke

especially of his tine coloring and h.u=
many in which he excelled.

Corregio, by Gertrude lngalls was
colrcisely and creditably given. The
copies of masterpieces of these great-
est artists which were exhibited, added
much to the interest.

Tire session closed with an ably
rendered piano solo by Helen Millard,

With a fair day and grounds in
good shape Gr‘innell lreid the “go-
phers” down this afternoon to such
an extent that Wheeler’s drop kick
from the Borpard litre tied the score.

It was a magnificent exhibition of
football, exciting from the ﬁrst kickr
oti‘ until the timesmen called time at
the end of the second half. The tea-
trrres of the game were Freeman’s 60-
yard rrrn for touchrdown for Minne-
apolis and the magniﬁcent drop kick
of “Fat“ Wheeler.

For Grinnell Burd, Douglass and
Lymalr were the best ground gainers.
Occasionally Griunell fumbled on
critical occasions brrt aside from that
the team showed up well and tonight
old Griunell honors every man on
the team. She honors Captain Burd
and she honors “our only” Guy E.
Wheeler.
