The slaughter of 400,000 blacks
by the Sudanese regime, also black,
has not fomcntcd any outrage in lib-
eral circles. When their silence is
compared to their reaction to white
oppression in South Africa, it is re-
vealing. It exposes a racist assump
tion that there is nothing outrageous
about crimes by blacks. What do you
expect ofa genetically deficient sub-
species?

South Africa was punished, with
sanctionsandotherinsults,forcrimes
less severe than those of tolerated
regimes. Buchanan once noted in his
column that after South African ath-
letes were denied participation in the
Olympic Games, gold medals were
won by East Germans whose regime
was shooting schoolchildren trying
to escape over the Berlin Wall.

Speaking of hallucinations, Ijust
spent all day in this very computer

lunch though. This is why I’m brain
dead. And why I found myselfasleep
in bed at ten o‘clock tonight, waking
slowly up, sweating, and staring at
the radiator. That noise. Can you hear
hallucinations? I have always been
able to see pictures in my closed eyes.
I can’t control the images. They usu»
ally spiral down and away from me.

don’t notice in this not too large com-
puter room when my friends leave
and I look up andjump—startled that
they are no longer there. Today I
spent in a corner facing the entire
room. Suddenly I’d look up and the
room would be full. Where was I?
Dreaming of paisley, no doubt. With
my eyes wide open.
