8 Scarlet 8r Black

Liberal pundits say that white rac»
ism is still a problem in the U.S.,
citing the beating of a black motorist
by white policemen in L.A. But as
Lew Rockwell points out in the Au-
gust issue of
Chronicles maga-
zine, the beating
was not what the
butchered video-
tape makes it Seem.

Rodney King (a
career criminal) did not cooperate
with the police, repons Rockwell.
Instead. he grabbed at his side, as
though groping for a weapon, made
obscene gestures at the policewoman,
and lunged at one of the officers. 1
would guess that these provocations,
not racism, are the real reason they
beat himgespecially since they did
not harm King‘s two black rampart»
ions.

One can disagree with the verdict
handed down last spring, but iis mo-
tive was not racism, but the belief
that, in view of the wretched circum—
stances in which policemen have to
work. it would have been criminal to
undenriine them. It’s amusing that
those who responded to the verdict
with such rage reacted coolly to the
murder, arson and looting plaguing
Los Angeles.

Shortly after a black gang mur~
dered a white Yale student in New
Haven, one member gave a full ac
count of the crime to the police. The
New York Posl pointed out that unr
like the film of Rodney King's beat-
ing, this account was not presented
innumerable times to the public by
the media. In the liberal lexicon it‘s
okay to commit a vicious interracial
crime—if a white’s on the victim
end.

When racist whites assaulted blacks
in Howard Beach, New York, local
editors put reports of the crime on the
front pages of their newspapers, hopr
ing this would shock white readers
into awareness of the enduring and
violent nature of white racism. But
when a group of blacks in the city
smashed a Vietnamese man's skull
with a hammer, shouting “Chink!”,

COMMON SENSE

the crime received little notice. Nor
did the editors give much coverage to
the racially motivated kniiing by a
black ofBrianWaikins,a22-yearold
Utah native who was visiting New

York with his par-

ents.
Rather than de-
plore such crimes,
liberals attempt to
justify them by
drawing from a
deep well of social excuses, Somcr
timesthisis difficult,asin the case of
the 1989 Central Park rape, commllr
ted by a gang that included middle-
class blacks who went to a decent
high school. The task is invariably
complicated by other ethnic minori-
tiesilews, Italians. Irish—who. den
spiteterribleeconomicconditionsand
extreme bigotry, never committed
such crimes. Sometimes liberals rer
mind us that American blacks are
descended from slaves, a condition
that makes them unique among the
nation‘s minol'ltieS.Butdocsit7 There
are in the U.S. Vietnamese and Chl-
nese who came from Communist son
cietics where they enjoyed less free
dam and wealth than the average
slave did.

It would be stupid to make special
allowances for ethnic groups because
members of them were persecuted
somewhere along the historical line.
Just about every ethnic group in the
worldwouldbeentiiledtoprivileges.
No one makes such allowances for
Chinese, whose relatives rotted in
prisoncampsunderMao,orforJews,
who live with the knowledge that
members of their immediate family
were incinerated in Dachau. Why
make them for people whose anccsA
tors were slaves?

The liberal hypocrites demand tol-
erance and compassion‘for the
groups they favor. There are minorir
ties whom it’s okay to malign. Anna
Quindlen in the New York Times can
call the Irish “anledeluvian bigols”
without incurring the censure that
another commentator, Andy Rooney.
incurred when he insulted blacks.

Kambouroglou got it wrong on bar

To the editor:

This is a response to the 5ch

Kambouroglou regarding the fund raiser
at Stale Street Station. He is severely
misguided. Regarding his slatemcnt thin
inc police ought to be adequate, the W»
lice are. unlortunalely, not a be all and
end all regarding matters or justice. Ifthc
police were as effective as hc desires,
input from the public would be unneces-

sary (for example, no one would havc to
come forward as a Witness, because the
pclrcc would already know),.,.The State
