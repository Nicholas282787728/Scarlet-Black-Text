Conditioning Is
Daily Fare for
Varsity Matmen

During the last two weeks
Coach Brown's varsity wrostlers‘
have been working out in Darby
Gym with emphasis more on con-
ditioning than anything else,

Some of the newcomers who
have shown promise are Dave
Tolnlinson and Bob Peshel in the
128 pound class, while “Sparky"
Parker, Marv Heller, and Don
Mclniies have been working outl
at 136 pounds. ’

Herb Wright, one of the five
returning letterrnen, will wrestle
again at 145 pounds, while Hoiviei
Olson, another veteran of ohel
mats, will be in the 155 pound‘
class.

Rick Wentland and “Pickles",
Lindseth, newcomers to the varel
sity this year will grapple at 165
and 175 . pounds respectively
Wentland has high school exper-‘
iehce behind him, as he formerly
wiestled at La Grange high in
illinois. It is hoped, however,,
that George Gregg will be able
to return to the 175 pound class,
which he weighed last season.

Bud Gregg, undefeated during
the 1948 season, will again be
Grinnell's heavyweight.
