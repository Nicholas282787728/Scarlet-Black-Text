An Idea of Fire

The th annual Gr' lllell College \Vritcrs’ Conference is
over for 1 i0 and tlle filial story has been written for _th '
noteworthy project. ‘iut we sincerely hope that one idea
growing ollt of this g the-'llg will be caught up in a \rlllrh

reputedly fertile soil bellerth the verdallt campus sod.

stories entered ill the contest \\ ere on political themes.”

he has making a remark of singular import. But to our
mind he has touched on an idea 1' alight with the darkest
