44-0

by Trevor Harris

Last weekend, The Grinnell
Rugby Club began its fall season
by playing the Newton Rugby Club
here in Grinnell. The Griffins, a
team with a large freshman cone
tingent this fall, played excellently
against the older, seasoned
Newton men. Although the team
lost several players to the football
team and lost veteran Erik
“Animal" Miller, who broke his
ankle at a practice, the Griffins
defeated Newton 4470.

Due to their intensive aerobic
training, The Grinnell pack,
lighter than Newton's pack by
about 200 pounds, was able to sup-
port the backs well throughout the
game and near me end was even
winning some of the scrimmages.
In commenting on the Grinnell for-
wards, hooker Trevor Harris had
this to say: “I think that the lore
wards played very well, taking
everything into consideration. We
were up against rugby’s equivalent
to the [Boston] Red Sox,”

The backs also played intensely,
with strong contributions made by
alumnus Chris Bain, Dave “DQ
Guzzler“ Gerard, and Kirk “Quiet
Death” Marty, “The backs played
very well, and although some or
the tackles were a little weak, it
was understandable, because
tackling is just something that
comes with practice, lots of prace
tice," said Harris. Finally, on a
sad note, Senior Steve Bridges
separated his shoulder during the
game and will be out for several
weeks.

This Saturday, September 26,
The Griffins go to Des Moines to
take on the Drake Law School
Rugby Club. The game promises to
be spectacular, as does the post
game party. Go Griffinsl ll

The Ultimate Spor

by Robert Sparks

“What happened to the field?”
was the cry that filled the air as the
I.M. ultimate Frisbee season
threw off. ”It's only about half the
size of last year." Now you can
throw a scoring pass from
anywhere on the field. After the
first week, Olf-Campus, the defenr
ding ultimate Frisbee champ, is oil
to a fast start as it is undefeated in
its first four games. However, it
could get a strong challenge from
Langan, the only other undefeated
team at 5'0. Other teams doing well
include Cleveland and Haines with
identical 3-: records. interestingly
enough, the defending overall I.M.
champ, Read, is off to a slow start
as it is winless in is first three
games. Here are the complete
standings through Monday,
September 22.

Death is forever.

Tough Breaks

for

Pioneers

by Walter J Maley

It is unfortunate that it did not
take long for the Grinnell football
team to experience the agony of
defeat in this late-starting 1987
football season, Grinnell got
trounced by Concordia of Illinois
by a Score of 48-20. But Wait, that
isn’t all the bad news. As if losing
the game and having a paucity of
able players on this year's team
wasn’t enough, several key players
were injured in Saturday’s effort.
Team captain and starting
fullback Mick McClean broke his
wrist in the game and will no
longer be able to carry the ball tor
the offense. He will therefore
switch to defensive end and play
with a broken wrist. Offensive
lineman Scott whipple broke a
thumb Saturday and will also con~
tinue playing, though injured. Give
these guys credit: playing iootball
with broken bones is a very tough

Coach Martinek summed up the
game by saying, “In order for us to
be competitive, we can’t make
mistakes. Saturday we made
mistakesH The coach also
remarked that this year's team is
not a physically dominant one, so
they have to play smart if they 6X7
pect to enjoy any success. Hopeiub
ly they will learn from the
mistakes made this week and imr
prove on this effort. 0n the bright
side, Martinek said the team has a
good attitude and is made up of a
bunch of hard-working kids. “We
played wihi them for 3 quarters. I
thought hie offense played well.
That Second quarter killed us.”
The first quarter ended with Grin»
nell and Concordia even at 7, but in
the second quarter the roof fell in.
Grinnell surrendered the ball three
times deep in their own territory,
with a fumbled option play, a
blocked punt. and a fumbled punt.
Concordia capitalized on the
Pioneers’ gifts, scoring after each
turnover, The Cougars led at
halftime 3577.

Jim Weiand started at quarter-
back and threw a 15-yard
touchdown pass to slotback Craig
whitaker. Chris Geisert, taking
over the fullback role, played well
and scored on a four-yard dive.
The final score came on a pass to
slctback Paul Manternach from
Dave White

This week, Grinnell travels to
Chicago to play Lake Forest. Lake
Forest lost to this same Concordia
team 17-16 the week before Grin-
nell did. Good luck players! ll
