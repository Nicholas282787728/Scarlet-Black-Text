Now from the outside world: A dear
friend in Minnesota sends me the news of a
speech pathologist in Beverly Hills who
operates a “deprogramming center" for
kids inflicted with the terrible disease
“Valspeak,” the famous lingo of ”The
Valley Girl." Ms. Glass says she has
“treated 200 to zoo teenagers" addicted to
Valspeak, and insists that the affliction is a
national speech disorder of “monumental
proportions.” She also says, ”Beyond the
semantics of Valspeak there is something
much more ominous. 1t is a language
characterized by a boring monotone and a
functional hypernasality (like speaking
with a clothespin on your nose) and in7
appropriate inflection (such as ‘It‘s like so’
grody’l."

Valspeaks also speak excessively fast,
fail to coordinate speech with breathing
and exhibit a “laidrback manner accom7
panied by sloppy posture and a corpse-like
facial expression “ Ms, Glass treats the
patients by videotaping an interview with
the patients and playing it back. Their
usual reaction is “Gross me out, do 1 like

Nocturnal adventures: pools

On Tuesday of this week. while Walking
to Quad for dinner, I found laying in [he
loggia a letter that the editors of this
publication Icll certain was meant to be
sent to the Shh. The body of the letter IS as
follows:

To the Editor: I would like to take this
opportunity to \‘che a complaint I have
regarding the operation of the Grinnell
Country Club, or, more specifically. the
operation of the pool at the G.C.C.

To make a short story long. I was sitting
beneath a tree one day last week, feeding
my face with Reese's Pieces and telling
Robin Williams jokes to an amused
assemblage of squirrels. when 1 suddenly
got a terrific urge to go swimming that
night in the G.C C pool.

Just then my roommates. lago and
Ellwood, appeared "Listen," I said. ”1
have an idea for something dangerous and
exciting that we can do tonight," Iago and
Ellwood tried to guess my plans,

“Are we going to try and find a Carrel in
the libraryi" asked Iago.

"No," I said, "Let's risk bodily injury,
criminal prosecution and expulsion from
School to Swim in the Grinnell Country
Club pool tonightt "

“Swell!" said Iago and Ellwood in
unison.

So that night we ventured forth, full of
expectations and apprehensions of what
awaited us at the end of Park Street Soon
the clubhouse came into View, and in the
distance we could make out the rolling
hills of the golf course I motioned to
Ellwood and 1ago to keep quiet as we
snuck around to the back of the clubhouse
where the pool was, We climbed the fence,
and Ellwood ripped his Bermudas. When
we had all cleared the fence, we gathered
at the pool's edge to stare in shock and
disbelief.

The pool, you see, was half empty 0n
the bottom sat a layer of thick gunk that
seemed to quiver as if alive. And to add in
jury to insult, the wading pool was filled
with dozens of frogs.

”Yuk," said iago.

“Ish,” said Ellwood.

“Grody,” said I

Thus, we were left with no choice but to
climb back over the fence, on which
Ellwood again ripped his Bermudas, and
head for home. There were cars coming
down Park Street, so We hoofed it out Onto
the golf course and proceeded to take a
shortcut towards the track and football
field. ,

As we neared the track, we made out a

Letters

To the Editor:

1n last week's paper, John Egan and
Scott Raecker, when writing about the re»
cent Judicial Council case stated, “We feel
that the Judicial Council is showing its per-
sonal prejudices in that they and especialr
ly Dean Tederman, have finally found a
method of getting back at somone they
have not liked ever since they got here!" 1
do not normally respond to statements
made concerning me in the slits but, in this
case, 1 am making an exception.

The direct implication of this statement
is that the Judicial Council is my puppet. 1
find this remark insulting to both the
Judicial Council and to myself. The
Judicial Council is composed of two facul-
ty members and five students and I assure
you that they would never allow
themselves to become a puppet of Student
Affairs.

As to my involvement in this case, I
never spoke with anyone on the Judicial
Council about it nor was 1 present at the
hearing. students brought the charges to
the Judicial Council because their right to
have a safe living environment was
violated. How do you possibly perceive
that 1 was responsible "for getting back"
at someone who you feel 1 dislike". 7 sign

Way to go, Boze . .

To the editor:

From her visit to campus last Friday 1
saw Lynn Cutler attempting to cast the
fact that Congressman Evans voted with
President Reagan on a number of critical
votes in a negative light.

I assume that she is doing this because,
in less than two years, Cooper Evans has
established a reputation for being one of
the most effective, competent and decent
members of the House of Representatives

There Could be another reason for her
most recent antics. Lynn Cutler is pro
bably hoping that the voters will forget her
close and intimate assouation with the
failed presidency of Jimmy Carter. Back
during the salad days of the Carter Ad
ministration, you would have thought that
Lynn Cutler was Jimmy Carter's favorite
county supervisor if you were gullible
enough to belive her endless stream of self-
laudatory press releases

The big spending policies and big
government programs of Jimmy Carter
were repudiated by the voters in 1980.
These policies and programs, which Lynn
Cutler presumably continues to embrace,
brought us die huge federal deficits, high
interest rates, massive unemployment and
distrust of government that Cooper Evans
is now straightening out

My vote is with Cooper Evans He is
solving our problems. Lynn Cutler will our
ly add to them, — Sincerely, Lee Ann
Clayton, Grinnell College Republican
Chairperson
