Not since the Cornell'ganie ot two
years ago has any one contest shot
such a liolt into Griiinell's tranquility
as the coming one with the state in-
stitution, And rightly so,

For the iii-st time since 19 a Grin-
nell is meeting Iowa viiii-cr ly on the
gridiron, We are going against a tcaiu
troni an institution which has always
done well on the athletic iield. Iowa
has not always shown the class oi
other members or the “Big Nine,” it
is true, lint nevertheless she has done
well. Next Saturday we must expcet
that s c will he strong again.

ith the appearance or iowa on the
Grinnell schedule the Drake game has
left the i-iciiiiti-ot the limelight. When
we deieet a ll:li\c )' by a 5370 score

“ON TO lOWAl"

“0n lo'Iowzt!” is Grinncll‘s slogan
this week “On to lawn!" is the llaSSr
word on our campus, “On to Iowa"
is the phrase in which we are basing
our hopes.

Join the group on the street corner
and the ﬁrst three words you hear are
“On to Iowa!” Go to the boarding
club and there you hear them Speak.
