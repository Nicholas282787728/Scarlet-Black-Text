WTF: Where

the f’F*k am I?!

New students from near and far
weigh in on adjusting to their fresh
home in America’s breadbasket

av RON CHui

Year after year Grinnell welcomes ﬁrst years from a wide
spectmm of cultures. These new students hail from as close
as Chicago and as far away as Greece and many ofthem have
never been in a region quite like the cornﬁelds orowa.

, As a result, some aspects of Grinnell come as a shock,
causing them to ask themselves, like so many before them,
“W here the F‘k am 1?"

Victor Pinheiro '13, a student from Saudi Arabia, coma
merited that what he found surprising was that “downtown
was about three streets... and that a train track goes right
across the campus”

Even students from other parts of the counuy can find
themselves ﬂabhergasted by our slice of the Midwest. Rick
Bigler’13, hailing from the dry desert orAnzona said, “Noth
ing is artiﬁcially watemd'm'ln provides enough. Weird.”

Students from across America think Grinnell is “weird,"
but for some international students, cultural difretenccs com-
bine to make Grinnell seem like a whole other planet.Tolu
Alabi ’13, a student from Nigeria, found it shocking “the way
younger people referred to older people by name. In Nigeria,
it is a sign of disrespect but here it indicates closeness. It was
really striking."

Like always, new Grinnell students have no shortage of
things to say about com. “I don’t know why I thought they
were kidding about the cornﬁelds," Keilllh, Courtenay ’13
from Los Angeles, California said. "1 came a week ago and
was excited to see it, But then I went a few more niiles..rand
a few more. .and it didn’t stop."

Alabi had heard that “there weren’t going to he roads and
corn was going to be all over place," she said.“Corn was going
to come up to the windows of rhe shuttle. 1 always thought
lowa was a farming place,"

Corn was not the only aspect of Iowa people were warned
about, but it often boiled down to that, “I had heard that
they were the friendliest people in the US and also that they
really really liked com,” said Pinhciro. “So far both of them
seem true."

For some, the thought of Iowa didn’t even merit a stereo-
type. “I actually didn’t think about the Midwest.” Courtenay
admitted. Pinheiro said that his family reacted to his decision
with the popular “Where? Cornell?"While for Courtney the
responses included, “What's in Idaho?“

Luckily, Grinnell is not, and students have found many
charms in the rolling lowa plains. "It's so pretty! Lots of
green stuff,"courtenaysaid. lowas lack ofhuman popularion
can also be a beneﬁt. “What I found is that Iowa is actually
spacy, meaning that its residents have a lot of personal space
and vast areas to have picnics, spend some time alone from
cities and relax in the ﬁelds,” said Anastasios Papachzistoudis
’13,a narlve of Greece.

As great as their experiences
so far have been, some students
still yearn for cerrain things from
home, “I miss the joy of strolling
the streets ofThcssalonki, strid-
lhg in the parks and watching
the waves as they crush the sea
coast," said Papachrisloudis. Bi-
gler misses the mountains and
dry hear of Arizona, while Alabi
pines for the food in Nigeria and
Courtenay mourns the absence
of LlAfs abundance of malls,
restaurants and movie theaters.

But despite what Grinnell
lacks, students ﬁnd reason
enough to settle in the middlc
of nowhere for a few years.
“Grinnell is my type. Small,
liberal arts, of? heat, friendly,"
Courtenay said. “That's my
thing.”

Hopeﬁllly, the students who
have already called Grinnell
their “thing" will soon call
Grinnell, Iowa their “place" as
well.
