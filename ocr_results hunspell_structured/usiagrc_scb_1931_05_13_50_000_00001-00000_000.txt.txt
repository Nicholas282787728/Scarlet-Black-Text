Carleton, Coe
in Track Meet
Here Saturday

Grinnell Hopes Bolstered
After Drake Win
Last Week

The Grinnell college track team
through its victory over Drake uni-
versity last week is, a slight favorite
to win the triangular meet with Carle.
ton and Core here Saturday. Both op—
ponents will bring strong teams, al-
though neither is well balanced.

One of the country's outstanding
milers, Ekwall of Carleton, will be
seen in action. He ﬁnished ﬁfth in the
National meet last year, and has been
running faster than 4:30 this year.
He and McRde, his teammate. won
ﬁrst and second placesih both the
mile and haifrmile in the Carleton-
Coe dual recently. Shefﬁeld has
thrown the discus more than 136 feet
and is the favorite.in that event.
Carleton will also bring Nelson, a
good hurdler.

Schiller vs. Douglas

Hild and Pulver, dash men, Hurka,
440 star, Arnett and Hahn, pole
vaulters, and Schiller. a high jumper
are the outstanding Coe entries. The
latter and Douglas of Grinnell have
both jumped 5 feet 11 inches this
year. Vermiliion will be expected to
give McRae of Carleton, and Murphy
of Grinnell a battle in the half-mile.

Alexander and Pojman will bear
the brunt of the work in the sprints
for Grinnell. while Hensley and Mur»
ray will take care of the hurdles. Ale
though he didn't compete in that
event against Drake, Murphy will
probably run the half—mile Saturday.
He recently broke the record for that
distance in the home meet two weeks
ago. The race between Ekwall and
McIlrath should be exciting, although
the Pioneer leader has not yet re-
covered from his operation,

. Pilbroiv Favored

Pilbrow. the diminutive Pioneer
runner, is the favorite to win the two
mile run. He established a new mark
of 9:51 for the distance against
Drake, and at the Drake relays was
unofﬁcially timed in 9:41.

Carleton and Grinnell have the
strong teams but both are weak in
events where the Kohawks boast
most of their strength. While the

_ hurdles and 440 are rated as tossups,
Coe has the best sprint prospects and
Grinnell and Carleton have the edge
in the distances, The strong team in
the ﬁeld events may use its power
there to get the winning margin.

after a hot and furious contest.

day.
Cottage Five Earns Fame

Cottage Five earned its share of
fame when Helen Mar Thompson was
[singled out for the Brown Bonnet
award. For years Miss Thompson's
fragile blonds beauty has enabled her
to get away with everythingipror
fessors. grades, and the other girls'
men—and this year, according to
Hawk, she triumphantly closes her
ieffortless campaign by getting away
.with a degree.

The Leather Medal, bestowed upon
Lee Henson. is a tribute to the prow-
ess of that Mexican athlete, Credit
and praise were given to Clark hall
men for their inﬂuence in the kite
award to Dorothy Loring. Had the
above vmen been less gullible, Miss
{Loring today might not be known as
,the coed with the farthest ﬁung line.

Preston Proves Technique

The worldly air and nochalant man—
ner have distinguished suave littlo
lPaul Preston during his ,two years
lat Grinnell, and the list of broken
)hcarts to his credit is ample proof
‘of the smooth technique which
brought him the green gloves. Hat
,Hander Hawk displayed rare judg-
ment in awarding the purple hose of
sophistication to Camilla Burrows,
lthe lady with the ”uppity-up" inan-
liner.
The most paradoxical award of the
lDrzg was the White Lily to Don Bro-
:dine, Mr. Brodines air of trusting in-
nocence has done much, according to
the donor of the prize, to counteract
lhis connection with a den of legalized
irobbery, the book store.
l Leta Riniifer received the Daisies,
rewarded for purity, But then, as
,Hat Hander Hawk put it. how could
Miss Riniker, handicapped as she is,
be “ a stone by day and a pillar of
Ifire by night”?
