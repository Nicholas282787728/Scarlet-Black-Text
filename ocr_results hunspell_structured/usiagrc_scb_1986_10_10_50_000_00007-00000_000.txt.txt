LETTERS FROM READERS

This morning I received my first hate
mail of the semester (of my college career
in fact). Here is what it said: “Ted - In
refrence to your column: it is waste of
space and an insult to the intelligence of
the student body. Are you an asshole on
purpose or were you born that way?

please grow up." _
TED AYS: I can’s help but notice that

Ted Amann

you must be quite a wimp. At least when l
insult people in print I have die balls to
sign my name to it. But you, you‘re so con-
vincingly eloquent. i suppose, that I need
only to read your anonymous note, and im-
mediately I will conform to your views.
Now that you‘ve told me, from afar, that
I'm an “asshole," surely lwill “grow up"
for you.

But to answer your question, Gentle
Reader, when it comes to people like you, I
am an ifasshole" on purpose. You seem to
be oneor those people who spends his/her
time moping through life, always feeling
puteupon, as if God had stuck a bottle up
your butt. i enjoy annoying people like
you. Plenty of people find this column
entertaining, or at least amusing, and they
tell me so, Apparently you don't. But that
just isn‘t enough for you, If you ain’t havin'

fun, friend, I suggest you leave. If you
don‘t like the column, don't read it. But
don't bother me rest of us with your self-
righteousness unless you’re gonna stand
behind it. Otherwise you’re just wastin'
time. .
ARE WE HAVING FUN YET'!

I imagine most of you have noticed a

. rather distinct lack of social activities on

campus this year. Last weekend, for die
second time this year, there were no all-
eampus parties at all. You can‘t really
blame SGA for this 7 it’s not our job to
organize parties (although we have this
year). it is YOU. the students at large who
must get together and organize these
events. It is not that difficult to do (I’ve
done it twice already this year). SGA will
provide Campus Security, a sound system
for your DJS, and money for food, NABS,
and decorations, All you have to do is: pick
a date for your party; reserve the location
(Student Affairs reserves Gardner/Pub);
give SGA an itemized budget for food, etc.
one week in advance; collect for alcohol (if
desired); do the shopping; set up the party
and clean up afterwards, Sure it takes a lit
tle work, but if you get people to work
together, it’s not that bad, And, in the long
run, its a lot more fun than complaining
about how little there is to do. And it's
definitely a hell of a lot safer than driving
home from Iowa City alter three ‘iced

teas,”

Unstrung Knees

Have you heard? Lyndon LaRouche is in
the news again. The FBI raided his offices
and his home (apparently undeterred by
the moat) to search for evidence for a
federal investigation, This may not be a
big deal for many of you, but it certainly is
for me, because Lyndon lives in my home
town. It's a big deal in the sleepy little
town of Leesburg, VA when one of our own
makes the national news, even if under the

Barbara Brown

——
unfortuate circumstance of being accused
of creditcard fraud.

Lyndon LaRouche, for those of you who
have not had the displeasure of hearing
about him, is a loon who makes it his hobby
to run for president. He moved to Leesburg
a few years ago and since that time, he has
made it his and his organization's home.
His offices are on King Street, right in the
middle of town across from a bookstore
which his associates also operate. When he
first came to our town, he moved into a
house just down the road from my house. I
used to drive by every day On my way to
school and wave at the guards in the guars
dhouse at the entrance to his estate. Lyns
don is very paranoid that someone
(everyone) is trying tO kill him, so he
keeps several armed guards handy. His
old house had spikes sticking up out oi the
driveway to slow down intruders l-ie since
has moved to a new house and decided a
moat better serves this purpose.

Wait a second NOW that I think about it.
“loon” is a very biased term. I shouldn't
make such judgments [Or you about a man
whom you never have met, You should be
allowed to form your own opinions without
the aid of my obviouslyeslanled view about
a person from my home town Let me see,
what are some typical LaRouche views?
Oh yes, the Queen of England is the head of
a major drug ring. (This makes sense, If
you were the Queen, would you want to

head up a minor drug ring?) lienry Klss~
inger, as i recall. is a KGB agent. And, diis

just in, Don Regan is the mastermind
behind the recent raids on Lyndon’s dwell»
ings. I’m sure Don Regan has no better
way to spend his time than to pick on such
influential and important people as Lyn-
don,

The most recent LaRoucherrelated
charges have to do withereditcard fraud.
It seems that some people have had the
nerve to imply that Lyndon's associates
overcharged their creditcard accounts. A
typical story is that the purchase of a [ew
LaRouche pamphlets, at an airport
perhaps, has shown up on the credit-card
bill as coming to $1,000. or some such
ridiculous sum. ‘

Lyndon has had tiffs with NBC news, too.
Lyndon said they slandered him; so, he
took them to court (this business of taking
someone to court is another hobby). and
sued them for something like two million
dollars. The judge not only threw out Lyn
don's claims, but he also decided to award
NBC the two million, which later was
reduced to 3200.000. Lyndon contested this
award tor a long time, but he just recently
was forced to pay up. it seems unfair to
make Lyndon pay it, as he claims, the
judge and jury were crooked and, as i
recall. involved in dealing drugs (probably
with Her Majesty, the Queen). What is the
world coming to?

Yes, perhaps I was a bit hasty in calling
Lyndon a loon (though I do like how the
word alliterates with his name: Lyndon
LaRouche, Loon). That certainly was not
polite, such comments, Lyndon probably
would say, come only irom a drug pusher
I do not want it spread around that I am a
drug pusher, so. i will have to keep my
uninformed opinions to myself and stop
spreading vicious gossip and innuendo
about my fellow Leesburgian I guess I'll
just have to keep my hometown pride
under wraps until ihave something nice to
say.

Have you ever noticed that whenever
anybody ever has to say something about
anything it is usually when the person who
is talking (or in this case writing) is ad
vocationg some sort of change in the status
quo? Generally speaking, when we are
satisfied with something we tend to let it go
unacknowledged. Only when we see a need
for change or come up against someone
else proposing a change do we become
vocal.

As i sat with my pad and paper in hand
preparing to write this column, i noticed
that the majority of my thoughts centered

around the concept of change. I began to .

Mickey Munley

feel as if we sometimes lose appreciation
for those things that fail to ever
demonstrate a need for change. In other
words, the things we are most satisfied
with receive the least of our attention,

I could write until my fingers fall off
(don’t any oi you get your hopes up) about
what I think is wrong with our school, our
country, or whatever. In the same light, I
could experience the same result writing

.about what is right with those exact same

things.

If it is just as easy to write about the
good as it is to write about the bad, why not
write about the good? in answer to my own
question i would have to say that the good
is ignored because it is non-controversial.
So, what makes controversy so in»
teresting?

Actually, I don’t think it is that con-
troversy is interesting but that it is easier
to write about. Anything that is controver-
sial has at least two distinct sides 7 and
often more. Whenever people disagree the
array of opinions are almost limitless.
This suggests that, for whatever reasons,
people are in more agreement about what
is good.

Rather than further explore this idea
about why people are more outspoken
about things that are unsatisfying. i want
to make the jump right into writing about
those good things we often take for granted

The United States Constitution. ap-
proaching its 200th anniversary, is without
question a document unparalleled in the
history of mankind.

Friends — you laugh with them and at
them, bitch to them and about them, cry on
them and for them, 'and share life with
them.

The privilege to hitch both in private and
in public,

Rather than go on and on about what I
consider to be good, I'd be very interested
in what you thought was good. Since my
ultimate intention is to incorporate some
of your ideas into future columns, please
send your ideas to my campus box (9733).
Tell me what you think. I’d certainly be in-
terested in what other people thought was
good 7 or bad, or whatever.

Best of luck to all of you in regard to your
academic endeavors next week. Look on
the good side 7 break is just one week

GORP Policy Defended

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter to answer a stu-
dent’s claim in a recent SdtB that‘he was
not accepted on a GORP (Grinnell Outdoor
Recreation Program) spring break trip
last year because of “probable discrimina»
lion“ against toreigners.

The individual quoted a trip leader as
saying, “We are afraid hat you would not
fit in within the group because you are not
enthusiastic enough about the trip.“ This
issue has NOTHING to do with discrimina»
tlon Each break trip has a limited number
oi spaces. so the trip leader must decide
which of the trip applicants would likely
contribute to the success of the trip. in the
eyes of a trip leader, a candidate who does
not show enthusiasm about the trip is not a
good candidate, .

The GORP Break Trip program is
designed to give participants the upper
tunity to safely learn or refine skills and
judgement in an outdoor pursuit that may
well provide lifetime enjoyment, A suc-
cessful break trip requires that each
member of the group must be enthusiastic
about the goals oi the trip. For example, a
person on a kayak trip who is indiiierent
about kayaking, or dislikes camping, will
be a hinderance and a burden to me group
as a whole, while someone who is en-
thusiastic about thevtrip and activity will
likely add to thesuccess of the trip On this
basis, a trip leader must choose applicants
carefully, and Will oiten reject those who
do not seem genuinely interested and en»

thusiastic.

In reply to the charge that GORP trips
are not open to foreign students who “can-
not aiiord any other trip than with
GORP," I am afraid that the student
misunderstood the point of this comment.
Let me explain.

GORP break trips. (Fall, Winter, and
Spring) are intended to provide an in-
teresting and educational Option for
students with a particular interst in come
mon; bicycling, canoelng, kayaking,
backpacking, or crosscountry skiing as
examples, since GORP trips are designed
to serve students, they are as inexpensive
as possible. Unfortunately, nearly every
break trip has applicants who are not in
terested in the trip itself. but rather in the
low cost of the trip and the opportunity to
have a cheap vacation courtesy of GORP.
Inexpensive Vacations are not the goal of
GORP, and lack ofa more desirable orless
expensive option is not sufficient reason
for participation in a trip. indeed, GORP
break trips are NOT open to students:
regardless of nationality. who are just in-
terested in an inexpensive vacation.

It is my hope that the author of the letter
now undnerstands more clearly the com-
ments which he sprang upon as being
discriminatory in nature. GORP is a pro
gram whose success dependsentirely upon
student participation, and the broader the
spectrum of students who partitipaie. the
better. 7 Paul Budlong. GORP Program
