Candidates And 'Kids

by Greg Vranimr

J. C. Labowitz '71, who wrote regularly for the “Scarlet
and Black” last year, often began his "dynamite columns"
with an explanation of how difficult it is to write something
meaningful every week. J.C. would usually get his "inspira-
tion" at about midnight on the night before the absolute dead-
line for his article while sittingaround his room with a number
of joking friends. Although not possessing the spontaneity,
shall we say, of Mr. Labowitz's style, I still rely this week on
lastrminute inspiration, I want to discuss the cover story of
the just-published "Newsweek Magazine" (October 25, 1971)
dealing with the Youth Vote in the 1972 election.

”Newsweek“ commissioned the Gallup Poll organization to
try to find some hard data that could be used to substantiate
or refute various arguments about the youth vote in the up-
coming year. One can learn something from the article and I
recommend reading it, But not even Mr. Gallup and his scien~
tific analysts could really give very good answers to the
questions about the effects of the roughly 25 million new
possible voters.

Several generalizations (an be made on the basis of the in-
formation given in the poll. First, students will vote in per-
centages well under the 1968 voting turnout figure of 62%
for the entire electorate. Gallup estimates 42% of the possible
firstrtime v0ters will actually go to the poles.

One could expect, however, that as election day gets closer
and closer, more students will decide that they should vote.
Even if only 42% vote, about 10 million new ballots will be
cast-mot an insignificant number.

Some young people, just like many older veters, will or will
not vote no matter what; their minds will be made up without
much regard to the candidates, issues, orpolitical organizations
that emerge between now and election 1972. There is a quite
sizable number of newly eligible voters, however, whose den
cision whether or not to vote will depend on the election
campaign itself. It is this group that candidates and their
staffs are trying to analyze in hopes that a successful youth
vote strategy may be achieved.

Possibly the most surprising piece of information uncovered
by the survey is youth voters’ very strong support for Senator
Edward Kennedy as a Presidential candidate against Richard
Nixon. Almost 60% of the new v0ters would vote for "Teddy"
in such a race. Even though he flatly denies any possibility
of candidacy, Kennedy seemingly has support of almost all
segments of the young electorate, including even some cons
servative Wallaceites.

In trying to explain Kennedy's appeal, “Newsweek" quoted
a Kennedy staff member who said, ”He just naturally tends
to follow the issues that the kids are interested in...He always
seems to stand up for what they’re saying, and he goes where
they are."

This explanation of Kennedy’s support, however, conﬂicts
with another most interesting aspect of the surve - Young
people do not seem lobe "interestedin certain natural issues,"
and are not all ill one place either geographically or ideologit
Cally. In fact, in some ways, the breakdown of possible young
voters is the same as the breakdown of the general population.
As “Newsweek" terms it, “mirroring the total electorate,"
new voters contain about twice as many Democrats (38%) as
Republicans (18%). But, as might be expected, 42% of the new
voters consider themselves Independents as opposed to only
28% Independents in the older voters. So young voters are
less party-oriented than their elders. In my opinion, this
fact is to be praised r Iowa Republican Executive Secretary
Steve Robinson's ”Vote a straight Republican ticket if you
want change" not withstanding. (See last week’s 5&8, p. 2)

The explanation of Kennedy's support quoted above implies
that there are certain issues that appeal to young people. But,
according to the survey, there isnosubstantialproof thAt young
voters as opposed to the rest of the electorate, are easily
motivated by a candidate’s issues. Most politicians assume
that "kids are concerned about Vietnam, ecology, and mari—
juana." But as David Jessup, who is a youth vete organizer
says in "Newsweek”, “Net so~and if candidates approach the
youth bloc that way, they will alienate a lot of young people.
The kids who go to junior colleges don't have the same priori-
ties as those whoareatplaces like Berkeley and Stanford. They
want jobs and edumtion. Then there are the frustrated working
kidsu.”

Jessup’s statement is supported by the fact that 45% of the
new voters consider themselves “middle of the road,” 28%
"liberal or radical left", and 20% “conservative or very con-
servative", Students do not seem to be so much more “to-
gether” or of similar feelings than other segments of the
electorate.

It is becoming apparent, then, that the candidates in 1972 will
have to do masterful work to get themost out of the youth v0te.
Candidates’ success with the spectrum of young people will
depend in large part on their ability to show knowledge and
concern about the issues but at the same time to be noncomt
mital enough so as not to alienate those young people who do
not care so much about issues, and may even disagree on a
specific candidate’s views. If we accept the poll's conclusions,
in other words, candidates will have to play ”political games"
with young people just as they have with other segments of the
electorate for some time.

To the Edilors:

Some oi the attlludesascrlbed to iaculty

Parenlneilcally, I would request that
these wives be identified in nrderthat any

The inndanlentnl allltude behind these
recommendations seems lo be that the
college has some sort nl duty or obligar
lion toward the personal predicament oi
the iaculty wiie Indeed, they ask the
college to create jobs for them recoms

recommendation 2) “Create more parl—

In regard to recommendation 9) ”in

The tenth recommendation Indicates

Urges Flying
Flag M Hall Most

In response to the article “Flag at
Full Mast" (Oct. a son), I would like
in clarity the “history" as to why the
flag is at halismasl.

Your article alributed it lonproclamu-
tion by GOV. Ray in 1969, but as far as
I can remember, this is Irrelevant,
What really happened was that in the
spring 011969,Ted Click (a sludenl here
at that time) flew the campus [lag upside
down to signal his distress ovcr inc
Vietnam war. in the days following Ihis,
Grinnell Students discussed possible ac-
tions about the war. One decision made
by culnpuSrwide relerendum was thallhe
ﬂag would be flown at hali masl unlil
the Vletnlm war ends. I feel that this
history needs to be known since less
than one»inurth oi the Sludenls now preV
senl were here in 1959. This should be
considered in the decisions over whnl
to do with the newilagpoles.1personally
think that the flag should remain
at hall mast until the war ends, and that
we should get permission to ﬂy (he UN
Flag it unit must as well. Alter all,
the World suiiei's lml'l'l this war as well
as others.
