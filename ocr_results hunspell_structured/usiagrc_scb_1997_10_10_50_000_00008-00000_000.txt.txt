Coming off its second loss in as
many weeks, the Grinnell College
football team is hungry to get a win
this Saturday when it hosts Knox at
1:30 on Rosenbloom field. Last
week the Pioneers fell to Coe in a
close battle, 20-13.

“All you can ask foris to have the
opportunity to win and we had it,”
remarked Coach Greg Wallace. ”Un-
fortunately, we were unable to come
away with points when we needed
them and that made a huge difference
in the ball game,"

At the conclusion of the ﬁrstquar-
ter, the game was knotted at 0-0. Not
long into the second quarter Coe fl—
nally broke through to go on top, 7-
0, with a 68-yard touchdown run.
Then, just before the half, the

Kohawks got the ball on their own
20-yard line after Grinnell fumbled
into the end-zone attempting to
score, This Pioneer turnover led to
another TD for Coe and the score
was 14-0 at halftime.

pable of making big plays and that

After two disappointing road
losses last weekend, the Grinnell
College women's soccer team is re-
maining conﬁdent as it prepares to
host conference foe Illinois College
this Sunday at 1:00. The kickers
dropped their match against
Wheaton, 3-0, and fell to Lake For-
est, 4-2,

The Wheaton contest was well
played by both teams, but Wheaton
capitalized on mistakes by the Pio-
neers and scored three minutes into
the match. The Grinnellians fought
back, but it was an uphill battle and
Wheaion put two more into the net
and come away with the win,

“We had some great combination
play," commented Coach Jenny
Wood. “We werejust unable to get
anything paSt their keeper, Our for-
wards did an outstandingjob ofpres-
suring their backs and we played

solid defense. We learned a lot from
this game because we put together a
consistent stretch of minutes. Now
we need to minimize our breakdowns
and extend our stretches to the full
game."

Against Lake Forest, which was
a rematch of last year’s champion-
ship game, the environment was ex-
citing and emotional, Going into the
game the Pioneers were focused on
playing consistently for the full 90
minutes.

“Unfortunately, we did not obtain
that objective," remarked Wood.
“We scored to go up 1-0 just two
minutes into the game, but gave up a
goal less than eight minutes later.
From there on it was a test of wills
and Lake Forest played inspired. The
good news is that the season did not
end last weekend, so we still have
many practices and games in which
to ﬁnd our groove. Everyone is work-
ing hard and I am conﬁdent that we
will continue to improve."

 

and contain,“ said Wallace. “We
had missed some opportunities, but
were not out of the game yet and
knew that we needed to capitalize
on our chances if we were going to
compete for the win.“

The Koliawks, however, contin-
ued their fierce running attack and
set the tone in the third quarter with
a 42-yard reverse for another touch—
down. The point after failed and
Coe led, 20-0.

The Grinnell gridders remained
poised and kept working away for
another scoring opportunity. Quar-
terback Troy Dougherty found Ri-
chard Wemer for an 1 l—yard touch-
down strike to put the Pioneers on
the board. The extra point was
missed and Coe led, 20-6.

In the fourth quarter, Grinnell
achieved another score when
Daugherty connected with Jake
Boyer on a 6-yard TD pass, Nate
Solmose added the point after for
the final tally of 20-13.

“Our defense played well,” com-
mented Wallace. “Although Coe got
a couple of big plays, we contained
well and had a couple of near
misses, They got the plays when
they needed to."

Robby Lane and Jason Kelly led
the defense with 15 tackles apiece.
Mark Trocinski was lauded by
Wallace for taking on the grueling
assignment of playing offense as
well as his normal defenSive posi-
tion.

For the offense, Jim Hart led
Grinnell rushing with 73 yards.
Dougherty threw for 239 yards with
two ms and two interceptions. and
Werner pulled in six catches for 71
yards,

Now the Pioneers are setting
their sights on Knox, a preseason
south division favorite, The Prai-
rie Fire are 3-2 and a strong team,
according to Wallace. “They have
a potent offense, a strong and quick
defeiise, and a veteran squad," he
stated. "We are hungry for a win
after' being so close these last two
weeks. lam optimistic that we will
come out intense and prepared."

standings and Grinnell Coach John
Pﬁisch sees his sqund's road as difﬁ-
cult Illinois enters the game With no
victories in the conference.

“There are a lot of great teams in
the former north division. We have a
pretty young team and set our goals
high at the beginning of the season,
So far things have not really come to-
gether for us but we’ll keep trying to
adjust. We have already made some
good changes," explained the coach

Last Saturday the Pioneers fell at
Lake Forest, 3-0. “Our guys were
kcycd up and played fairly well dur-
ing the ﬁrst 15 minutes, but alter that
wc were totally outplayed," noted
