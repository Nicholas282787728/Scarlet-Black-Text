PROFESSOR ALLARD.

Grinnell will he host during the next
three weehs to a distinguished guest,
Professor Louis Allard, the'exchduge
professor from Harvard.

It is “th a great deal of pleasure
that we recall the short visit last yea-
of Prolessor Schoﬁeld in the same ca
pacity. lie was a man of rare p
sonality and one who succeeded in
making a friend oi every student and
faculty memhcy. '

It is with equal pleasure that we
look forward to Professor Allard's
visit. We hope and believe that it will
not only he highly prohtalile to all
Grinuell, but that Professor Allard will
hiinself become so imbued with the
Griuuell Spirit that he will remember
us long after he has returned to the
east.

We extend to Professor Allard greet:
ings from all Grinnell, with sincere
wishes tor a pleasant stay among us.
We will be happy indeed to have him
consider himselt. for the present, at
least, a Grinnellian.

“FORMAL DANCING.

Opponents or neutrals to dancing
should have been present at the lab-
oratory demonstration given in the
women's gymnasium artcr vacation.
To many of those who were present it
proved a revelation ol‘lhe success of
niiornial dancing at Grinnell. It
seemed convincing proof that dancing
in this form could exist in pcrlect
harmony with the Gl'imlcll aimless
nhere. .

Negatively. that dancmg is a. harm-
less and legitimate recreation. is iler
nleil by a very small minority. Thc
people or the state of Iowa and of the
middle wosL approve of dancing. 1,
base this only upon my own observ -i
tion hilt 1 do not believe that anyone
who is recently tamiliar with this ter~
ritory will contradict me. Lodges, pub-
lic schools, and churches not only,

encouraging dancing. Should notl
Grilluell, then, who is training men
and women oi and [or the middle west
reflect its ideals oi social life?

it cannot be denied that dancing,
like any other recreation, is often car-

ried to excess to the detriment of all
concerned. A system of faculty sup:
err ion, either placing a ﬁxed nulnr
b of dances, or passing on all he
tore they we're given would make this
ihle.

POSlthely, inorc dancing in Grinnell
would add much, Most important per»
haps, it would bring the college to
gather into a more perfect riiiity and
closer fellowship. As hetwecu the
men and women informal dancing‘
would accomplish this without in the‘
least curtailing the men’s college forl
men and the woinens college for We»
men.

Those who witnessed the dance of
Monday night will appreciate mm‘e‘
fully than can he descrihed the slip»
plicity, and spirit or informal goodl

A formal dance now and then would

‘serve as good practice in the rules of‘

etiquette.
