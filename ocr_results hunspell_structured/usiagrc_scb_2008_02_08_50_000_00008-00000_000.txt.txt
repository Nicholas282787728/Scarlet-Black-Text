Student art bridges town-gown divide

BY MATT ZMUDKA

In the town of Griunell, you don’t expect
art to continue very far past Bucksbaum. But
in the Griuuell Community
Center, up a ﬂight ofstairs and
down a cavernous hauwny, you
can stumble on an oasis ofwork
from Grinucll student artists._

The exhibit, at the Grinnell
Community Art Gallery, fear
tures the work of 18 Grinnell
students. Veronica Erb ’08, the
show's curator and an intern at
the gallery, did the planning for the experi-
ment over the past month. “I knew about the
possibility last spring, but the sincere work on
it didn't begin until the end of last semester,"
she said.

The happy marriage between Erb and the
gallery came as a result of Eros ﬁnancial aid
package as a worlostudy position. “Financial
Aid has to give a certain percentage of its

working here /
Show makes in

funds to students woiking in community set-
tings," she explained. in fact, he pay comes
from the college and not the gallery.

Erb hadworkcd there for
two semesters as a galleryas
sistant when the board sugs
gcsted that she cuiate a show.
In past years, professors have
put on exhibitions with tlieii
classes in the gallciy, but no
professor was interested this
year. “I had an idea, which
was to focus on works of art
that exempliﬁed Grinnell students'liberal arts
studies and nature," she said.

Her theme arose from two studio art class
as last semester. “Between the two,l noticed
there was this presence of liberal arts subjects
and attitudes in the art being made,” she said.

Erb began collecting pieces near the end
ariast semester. She and Emna Zghal,A.rt,se-
lccted the featured students. “She told us that

like that this
are students

she wanted otir sttiilto be in it the end ofﬁnals
week,so it was just the pcirect morale booster,"
said Rebccc lolinston '09.

The sel ted artists come from all .ical
deinic divisions. Motifs from other academic
aieas, even molecular structures, can be found
in much oftlit: art. Sci-ten printing constitutes
the majority ofrhe artwork, but acrylics, sculpt
ture, chalk and even photography can be round
in the exhibit,

The space itselfis very different from cams
pus galleries. Unlike the hustle and visibility
ofthe Faulconer or Smith, the Grinnell Com-
mun‘ity Art Gallery is almost hidden inside the
massive community center. While galleries on
campus make a statement with their architec-
ture, this gallery focuses all attention on the
art. “1 really like that this gallery is here, and
I've enjoyed working here," Erb said. “I like
that this show makes more students aware of
its existence."

Jon Rissing ’10, who has an acrylic paint-

lllg featuied in the show, believes that the
Show might help promote relations between
the campus and thi: city ofGrinnell.“lt rostci-s
involvement with the community, which is ale
ways a good thing," he said.

Sculptor Alex Schechter '10, another pai~
ticipanr, also appreciates the opportunity to
expand the audience fol his work. “We live in
this little conitoitable Giinncll bubble, so it's
a little scary when we get out there," he said,
refeiring to criticisms of their work.

Etb gives the artists credit for the success
ofthe show, "It’s really about the students who
are in the show. and that's why I was interests
ed in the subject," she said. “I really value the
Grinnell College community and the students
who are here."

The Grinnell Community Art Gallery, on
the second ﬂoor orthe community center on
Park Street (2 blocks south ofcampus),is open
Monday-Friday from 3-530 pm. and will
feature Grinnell student art through Feb. 21.
