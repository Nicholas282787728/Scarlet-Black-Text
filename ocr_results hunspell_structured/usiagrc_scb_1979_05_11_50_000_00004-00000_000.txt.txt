kept many viewers out of their

example or suspense, perversity,
and macabre, one that changed the
course of the “horror" film.

FINALLY. THE proposals. as
amended, were Voted on, and
carried with a healthy margin 49-
16-].

Also approved at the meeting
were plans to change the Black
Studies major into an Alrn»
American studies interdisciplinary
concentration. The Committee
presenting the proposal felt the
Black Studies major, as described
in the college catalog. does not
exist, and that the proposal would

maintain Grinnell's commitment
to Black Studies in a realistic way.
AFTER DEBATE centering on
the fact that the new concentration
requires only 24 credits tas op-
posed to the 32-34 credib required

motion carried by a voice vote.
An attempt to make tighter
restrictions tor double majors
