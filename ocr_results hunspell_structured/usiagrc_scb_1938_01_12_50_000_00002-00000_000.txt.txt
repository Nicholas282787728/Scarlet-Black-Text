Truesdale; Yearlings
Set for Three Tilts.

The slow development of the
freshman cagers will quicken now
that the varsity squad has been
cut, according to John c. Trues-
dale, basketball coach.

With fewer men on the floor,
the year-lings will receive more
attention than they have had up
until now. The squad is of good
height. and with the mechanics of
the game mastered, it will send
some good men to next year's
team, continued Truesdale.

The men out for the team are
Gerald Fort, Richard Adkins,
Robert P. Young. Rex Wade,
Charles Sayre, Charles Edwards
and James Norton.

Eugene Peisner, Edward Wal-
ters, Samuel Koster. Donald Kies-
t'er Robert Hamann and Robert
Jarvis.

The preps will play two or
three games this season, one of
which will he played here.
