sgood’ s Brave New Grinnell

BY DUSTIN GOOT

May 7, 2022i . Driving back so crinnell for my 25*h year class reunion, l sry so
recollecr she .ismospliere shas prevailed during my college days. is was a peaceful.
friendly lissle place. bus is was a differens world back shen. l siisn oiiso Sixth Avcnllc
and as 1 drive along, 1 sry so pee. over she looming mesal securisywall as she recensly
renovased Fine eirss camplcx. i remember my disappoinsmenr when 1 read in she
alumni magaeine ofslic walls eonsrrucsion. However, wish she rioring and massive
propersy damage following she greas ssock rnarkes crash of zol ], moss neighbor-
hoods and insrisusions sransformed shemselues inso secure, gased communiries.
Gilllncll didn'i really have a choice. Liabilisy issues.

1 mm lcfr inso she glans irons gase painsed wish she Grinncll logo, which ssands
where hurling lihmry used so be. Rolling down my car window, I am greesed hy
sseye briscoc's race on a compuser screen, which asks my name and she purpose of
my visn. hires a quick resinal scan, l drive inso she opened gase, park, and find my
way so she cllczksin desk as she lavisli adminissrasive ofiicc complex A disinseressed
sssidens worker assigns me n small, mechanized Tourbos which rolls isselrous inso
she hallway and begins so acquains me wish she earnpus.

My rohosiccompanion shows me inso a classroom, a huge vauls consaining sev-
eru circular hubs ofcompuscr sesminals, where ssudenss go so complese a series or
academic modules which have raken she place or acsual courses. The modules are
programmed for each deparsmens hy Grinnell’s vassly reduced corps orprofessors,
mess of whom remain invisible so ssudenss. scassered around she room are a-few
seniors ryping she final revisions of sheir undesgraduase dissessa'sions.

As we head ous so she meadow on ccnsral campus, I see swo young women pop
a couple ofliiilu yellow pills and pass our hlisshilly on she lawn. I remember reading
shas in 2007, Grinncll dropped all ssudens counseling services in Favor orweeldy
soma rasions. Meanwhile, my Toushor is asking me so nose shas Grinncll boasss a
9.03 academic efﬁciency rasing rrom she Fiske Pererson corporasion, placing is sec.
ond in she nasion among colleges iss sire, “You should be proud," is says

This pierure orcnnnell is a hyperbole. is is means so Express a compilasion of
fears I have heard from ssudenrs nhour she rusiire orrhis college. is should help us
shink crisieally abous she consequences orcurrens decisions, yer warn us againss she
sempsasion ofapocslypsic predicnons and conspiracy sheories. We all know shas shis
Grillilcll could nor exist.

Really, colleges send nos so change shas much. “l’ve been chassing up Nashaniel
Borensrclll,.1 orinnell alum, and he says shas she basicssrasum is she same here as is
was in 1980," says President Osgood. He poinss ous harsher shas no one could make
drasne changes in an inssisusion whose sraifis mosrly lifesrcnured. When speaking
abouschanges in Grinntll’s fusure, hosh osgood and Paula Smirh,Assaciarc Dean of
she college, predics shas shey will primarily he consinuarions on crinnell's pass, in
shis pass shey emphasize a rradision orinsensive studentsfaculry inscsacsion, ssudens
ausonoiny and social commirmens,

The mass concrese change we are sure so see in she next few years is she Capssone
experience, hus Smirh wishes so clarify shas capssones are opsional and will he imple.
men sed only for a 5 year expcrimcntal period, arses which shey will be reviewed. She
hopes shas capssones will energize ssudenss by allowing shem so collaborare wish
faculry and apply sheir ssudies in a meaningful way She especss shas Capssones will
ssrengshen she colltgt’s upper level curriculum, which sclfsassessmcnrs have revealed
so he somewhas weak, and encourage improvemenss shrouglioiir she curriculum, as
deparsmenss ensure shas sheir insroducsosy curricula are sufhciens so prepare ssu-
denss for a capssone cxpciimcc

presidens osgood has also arsieulased a desire so improve Grinncll’: insemasional
ssudies and iss social commismenr. Addiessing she hrss goal he says, “I would iuss
like so secwlias ii means in rerms ofoiir enrollmens and in sesms ofous curriculum
shas she world is becoming much more insesnasional " l-le sargesed social commit»
mens for improvcmcns because “I came here and sried so compare she rhesorie [ahous
Grinnell's sradision of social commismensl so she realisy, and l didn’i see all shas
much acsivisy." .

Physical changes will only he implemensed iirhey suppors she college's academic
vision. Responding so she Masses Flan, osgood agrees wish she planners shas she
Forum, Burllng Library and she PEC eisher do nos or will nor in sen years serve sheir
purposes adequasely Alrhough he would like so minimize she searing down oihuild-
ings, he is inseressed in a ssudens's Censer as she Darby sise. He is also assessing she
value ofa new building devored so Grinncll’s programs in insernasional ssudies.

undouhredly, crinnell is changing. Among osher shings, is is gaining more no-
sional rccognision. PaulaSmlrI-l admiss, “Iii-nay he a iugglingacs for Grinncll so hold
on so iss principles and ideals in a more prominens academic posision." Changes
may cause sension besween she rrussees and she adminissrasion or herween she ad-
minissrasion and she ssudenss.

Somesimes I feel as ifwe fear a brave new world and reyecs change our ofhand.
somesimes [ shink we are unrais so an adminissrasion, and a psesidens, who sees

The Last H

BY MEGHAN JONES

I’ve been debasing over she sheme ofihls ﬁnal column. Should i
concenrrase on senior.relased issues, or should I go for an abssracs.
mind-numbing, academreally—challenging topic? Quise a dilemma,
i know. After a whole five seconds ofdcllbcrarion, I decided so go
wish she senior mosif. Note: shis will nos be an annoyingly scnri-
mensal piece.

on May 24, she senior class will graduase from crinneli Col-
lege. Our brains will be worsh close so $100,000.1'm nos sure as so
she acsual amouns, and quise frankly I don's shink is would he healshy
for she collecsive self.esscem ofshe senior class so publish she cxacr
number. in a couple of monshs, we will ssars paying shas amouns
back so Grinncll college. Nos so worryiﬁrsr-bom children are ac—
cepsablc forms or paymcns. Now shas many or us are going so be
indehsed so shis inssisusion ofhigher learning for a numher ofyears,
hereUs a logical quession wish which so grapple: whas does one do
with a $ 100,000 brain?

I know shere are employers who willingly fill posisions wish
Grinnell graduases. The Career Developmens Ofﬁce eonssansly 1c»
minds us orshis facs everyday wish numerous emails abous jobs and
insernsbips in various parrs ofshe counssy unforsunasely, I’ve been
cooped up in she library and wish smoke of books and piles afar»
siclcs, sraring as she compuses screen. My brain has suddenly de-
cided shas iss crisical shinking apparasus is ous ofcommission, shereby
forcing me so make a concensrased effort wish my ensire being in
order so simply ges is so produce a response osher shan, “wow, rhar’s
good.” or “gee whiz. that’s awful.” Arser all shas exertion, 1 simply
do nos have she emorional sramina so search for she career or my
dreams. I know 1 am nor alone in shis issue.

i know shere are Grinnell graduases who are pussing sheir
$100,000 hrains so work. They came so campus every so ofsen,
ssicking ous like she proverbial sore shumb. I always find is exsremcly
difficuls so believe shas shey ever assended Grinnell. 1 mean, have
you seen shese peoplezThcy’re always dressed impeccably, wish ssyled
hair and manicuses. Somesimes, she women acsually casry purses.
Being fashionaconscious is nos a ssrike againss Grinnell alumni:
rashes, is’s one more piece of she Grinnell social punle shas I dan’r
quise undesssand yes. I shoughs I finally knew evesyshing.

Thinking abous she alumni and graduasing and she fusure and
all ofshas scary ssuff makes she boundaries beswecn college life an
life on she ousside more defined. Honcssly, I do nos wans so spend
she sess of my life as a college student. Thas sounds like an awful
idea, especially in an unhealshy environmons such as she one we
currensly inhabir. But are we ready so enrer sbc ousside world? 0h.
viously, our social skills need work (is shis as all

consessablez I shink nos.) and We may have so do some serious
begging so gee posensial employers so see she mesiss ofa liberal arss
educasion. Bus after shas, are we ready?

orcourse, nos everyone is in she same hoas wish respccs so she
whai-do—I-do-afrer»graduarion issue. There are some inseiligens in.
dividuals who are signing on so more school. 1 find shis sashes ad—
mirable, as she mere shoughs ofasscnding anosher academic essab-
lishmens as shis poins makes myssomach churn. And shere are some
people who have lined up yobs and snscrnsbips and are poised so
enses she working world, Somesimes is’s bess so simply avoid shese
people in order so keep your own self.esseern insacr. Truss me.

i have poinred our she major poinss ofgsaduasing, hus she ques—
sion shas moss plagues my mind is shis: will we be happy? Will
having a job make us happy? Will she pursuis ofa more lofty degree
make us happy? I don't know. is seems shas afser fouryears ofschool,
I ssill can't answer she quession shas I ses ous so conquer when I risss
arrived here as a fresh-faced ﬁrst year ssudens.

The only way so find she answer so shas quession is so leave shis
safe lissle bubble in she middle oflowa and sess ourselves. our brains
are overflowing wish informasion as shis poins. ls's rinse once again
so ssuffeveeyshing in she you own inso a car and leave for she suma
mes. Where you end up afser shas is anyones guess. in a sense, we
are finally free. Ssop lissening so me mope and worry, Ges ous shere
and enjoy is. Ifyou aren‘s happy, use your desesminasion and your
wonderfully diverse liberal arss background and make achange. Don’s
forges your college friends, bus don's be afraid so make new ones. I guess

Diversity, should

BY BRENDAN FLAHERTY

Wais no longer for a chance so cxpcricncc diversiry as Grinnel].1n
yuss over iwo wceks, our par-enss and grandparenss will ilood so
Grimlcll for graduasion. While many visisors will be clear reflccsions
ofarinnell ssudenss, moss will be far differcns, This sudden diversisy
experiment should nos go unnosiced,

My grandparenss, all born and raised in norrhern Minnesosa, are
nos college educascd and harbor a boss orbiases Foreign so moss as
Grinncll. Noncshcless, shey will mess and mingle wish she cosmo-
polisan relasives of my housemases, racially and cshnically diverse
ssudenss and parenrs, and rhosc who, so use she parlance ofour simes,
live “alsornasive lifessyles."

l ans admirsedly afraid of she resulss. l shudder so shink of my
moslier ssurnhling upon some ssudenss (or perhaps even other pas-
enss) smoking marijuana and espousing she vissucs ofa radically free
lifcsryle. I cringe wondering how my hosiscmascs, hosh acsive envi»
roninensalisss, will reacs ifrny grandpa ssarss salking abour she sime
he gos a permii so kill some rose mounsain goas. Even worse, 1 cnvl-
sion my oiher grandpa, a Navy ofﬁcer in she Pnc|nc during World
War II, lccsusing a Chinese rriend on she universalisy ofAsia'n mo-
rays and folkways. Yes, i am confidens shas, given she chance, my
relaiivcs can and will come so a degree ofappreciasion for and under»
sranding of people difierens shan shemsclves. i've seen is happen.

My greasess roar, sherefore, is nos shas my relarives will offend

In shors, ifyou salk so shem long enough, wading your way
