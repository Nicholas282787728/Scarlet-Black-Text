Seek Black Candidates

by Anne Waller

President Leggett last Mon-
day reported to the faculty on
the current progress ofhis 11*
point program of goals thathe
has defined for the college this
year.

His program for hiringblack
hculty members incorporates
a "Search" or "Clearing
house" committee thathas the
responsibility to take the des-
cription of qualifications
needed for an open position,
locate blacks who seem p0.
tentially qualified, and send
th‘se names and their cre~
dentials to Dean Wall. Dean
Well, the department involved,
and the "Search” committee
would then review the candi-
dates and invite the outstandr
ing ones to the college to be
interviewed by “the depart
ment, the appropriate student
groups, Dean Kimbo and the
facultv representative of the
Black Coordinating Come
mi‘tee, with the Executive
Council, and then with the
Deans and president Leg-
gett."

Some of the resource people
for black candidates were
cited as: Mr. Morgan, a Grin-
nell graduate from Gary, Ins
dizina; Dr. Billingslev of How-
ard University; possibly Hugh
Gloster and Norvel Smith,
Presidents of Morehouse Col-
lego and Merritt College res-
pcorlvely; Isaac McClelland,
A. stant Superintendent of

Wives Present Recommendations

(Editors’ not : Early in the
year, the 8&8 asked certain
groups on campus to inform us
of the results of any inVCStl’
gations undertaken by them
that are of general interest
to the Community. We were
given a copy of the paper be-
fore the facultywivesmetwith
the administration, but be»
cause of its length, it couldnot
be published in its entirety.)

/\ group of faculty wives
last week presented to the
administration a paper dcal~
mg with some of the problems
encountered by academically-
qualified faculty wives who
unsuccessfully seek pro-
fessional employment at the
college. The group of over 20
women, which grew out of the
first allcoampus meeting of
the Women's Movement, oris
ginally met to discussthe role
of faculty women in the Grins
nell community.

The paper points out that a
faculty wife seeking academic
employment occasionally en—
counters the joint obstacles of
personal prejudice against
women and nepotism, and that
she may even be deniedaccess
to the traditional processes of
application. Denied employ-
ment in the profession for
which she long trained, the
faculty wife, cut off from easy
access to cities and univer-
sities, finds few academic al-
ternatives available to her. If
she should find a job in the
Grinnoll community, it is air
most certainly not in herpro-

fession; jobs of any kind are
hard to come by. Likewise,
part7 time jobs arepractically
non-existent, while these
which do exist, either within
the college or without, pro*
vide neither job security nor
fringe benefits.

If the faculty wife attempts
to work independently, she
may find that the facilities of
the college are reserved for
the use of faculty andstudents
alone. The nearest large uni~
versity libraryisan houraway
by car, with its lending privi<
leges altogether denied to
long- distance commuters who
do not hold professional jobs.

status and all monetary res
compense, she is often viewed
in the end by the remainder of
the community as a self-in-
dulgent and pretentious dis-
content who pursues her costly
“hobbies" as “an exuse to
get away from her kids.”
The paper expressed the hope
that the college would begin to
identify with the predicament
of these women and provide
practical and satisfying solu*
tions to some of their pro-
blems. Toward this end, the
following recommendations
were made:

In times of difficult economic conditions, college budgets
are more mrefully monitered than usual and budgeting ”fat"
is trimmed away by reevaluating priorities and cutting back

programs.

In the past two years, the college’s public events budget
has been cut quite drastically; the amount of money available
from general college funds for these activities is lower in
1971-72 than in any recent year. Because other sources of
funds have been cut, a greater percentage ofthe independentlyr
administered SGA finances are now being used to fund all-
college public events. Despite budget cuts, the presentadminb
Strators of outsidentherclassroom programs have managed
reasonably well to please most of the college community.
However, a careful examination of the budgeting system for
these programs will show, I believe, that improvements need
to be made in order to get our money's worth in the public

events market.

cannot be found to fill these
positions in a reasonableper-

The next group of applicants
to be given priority would be

has been satisfied that a ”full
and honest attempt has been
made to hire a black or a wo-
man” other applicants maybe
considered.

conceded that “our record in
the employment of women fa-
culty is no better than our rev
cord of hiring black faculty".

Area Birth Control
Center Awaits Funds

The exact operations of the
Women ’5 Movement Office
have been the subject of some
confusion. The office is loca-
ted in the P.E. Complex and
has been established to serve
many needs.

In addition to providing a
room for meetings and dis- '
cussions some members of
the movement will use the
office for birth control coun-
seling. This counseling ser
vice will be mannedby student
volunteers and will only be
authorized to dispenseadvice.
No contraceptives will be dis-
tributed by the office.

The service will only give
general information to anyone
interested on birth controland
other related subjeCtsandwill
refer anyone who desires fur-
ther information orassistance
to the proper professionals.

it is hoped that by December
or january definiteplans about
a community birth control
center located in the town of
Grinnell will be confirmEd by
0E0. Presently, OEOiswait-
ing for Congress to act on
legislation providing funds for
such projects.

When the fundsareavailable,
0E0 director for the state of
iowa, Bob Tyson, has assured
women's movement members
that the project will be ap-
proved. Once the center is
esmblished it will serve POW'
eshiek and three adjoining
counties The center will not
be located on campus.

Since the project will have
a high annual budget, the col-
lege, towns, and counties in-
volved may be required to
match funds. In the event of
this type Ofrequestlhe college
is prepared to provide some
assistance both in the form oi
cash and of services in kind.
The college would provide re-
ceptionists and other workers
in the event of such a re
quirement.
