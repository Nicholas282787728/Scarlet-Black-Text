GLEE CLUB EXAMINATiON.

A notice was posted yesterday
(or the Glee Club examination,
which will be held in the School
oi Music roonis tomorrow night
at seven o'clock. All men who
have good voices and a iuir know-
ledge ot music are requested to
come. The examination is en-
tircly impersonal and the candi-
date is marked solely on his merits
as a singer. The vacancies are
fairly well scattered over the four
parts, but a tow voice will stand a
slightly better chance of entering
the club.

The prospects for having an ex.
cepiioually good club this year
are very bright. Tire return of
Mr. Atkinson, who was with the
club two years ago, will materially
strengthen the bass, and it is very
reasonable to expect that the
second year under the new di-
rector be better than the
ﬁrst. The trip in the southern
part of the state last year was the
most snccessiul ﬁnancially otany
in the history of the club and
plans are now being made tor a
trip this year.

No man need feel that he is as
suniing too much by coming to
the examination even ithe has
sung very little, as it is frequently
the case that good voices are dis
covered on that occasion,

DRAKE GAME SATURDAY.

Next Saturday the team will go
to Des Moines for the ﬁrst real
game at the season. Altho it is
only an exhibition game it will
show the condition of the teams
and will give sotne idea of their
comparative strength. The team
is at present ﬁghting against hard
luck, having lost eight of the last
year’s 'Varsity.antl having (elv ex-
perienced nicntoﬁll their place,
The men have only had trrne to
work up even a tair amount ot
team work. But out of the green
material Coach Tratt may be able

 

to develop a last, consistent team
if he receives the support at the
students, \Vheti the team
difﬁculty and Fighting against add»
is the tune when support does the
most good. and Grinucll atria, s
helps the learn ﬁght in a ﬁnish
even inalosing game. Let the
team know everybody in school
is behind them and they have
more heart There is plenty of
time yet to develop astrong team
andnoiv is the time when student
support will help the most toward
that end.

Rates to Des Moines are
yet settled but a good rate will no
doubt be secured, and a large
crowd of Grliinell iooters should

be on the side lines Saturday.
