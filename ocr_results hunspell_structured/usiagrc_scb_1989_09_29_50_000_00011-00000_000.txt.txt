FINANCIAL AID

dents‘ abilities to pay for college.
The New York Times reported in
August that the Justice Department,
involing the Sherman Antitrust Act.
was investigating whether elite col-
leges and universities were operat-
ing in restraint of trade by setting
similarlevels of tuition and financial
aid. Of special concern was the prac-
tice under which some schools meet
and agree to offer the same student
virtually the same amount of aid.

According to Lincoln, the prac-
tices under investigation are those
designed to give students the oppor-
tunity to base their decision on col»
lege attendance on factors other than
money. “I can’t say they did a ter-
rible thing," Lincoln said.

Hopkins added that recent gov-
ernment actions conoeming student
aid have been counter-productive.
“We certainly know that the govern-
ment doesn't understand the aid
process," Hopkins said. "The devil
in me would say there might be a
collusion involved,butwe'll have to
wait and see." he said.

“Generally, the schools included
in the investigation 7 East Coast
schools — are more involved in
prestige pricing," Hopkins said. He
said the investigation “might be a
matter of prestige-pricing versus
price-ﬁxing." noting that the dis-
tinctionbetweenprestigepricingand
price-ﬁxing can be a ﬁne one. “At
the same time. treating everybody
equally does not constitute price
ﬁxing,” Hopkins said.

Lincoln denied that Grinnell
“buys" students “It is my under~
standingthatGrinnell‘slucrativeaid
packages have inclined some stu-
dents to come here." he said. “But
most students aren‘t here for the

money.”

According to Hopkins. it is the
high proportion of grants relative to
loansorwork-studyprogramswhich
makes Grinnell's ﬁnancial awards
attractivebothLincoln andHopkins
refuted the idea that Grinnell‘s
“lucrative” awards evaporate once
students have completed their ﬁrst
year.

“We have never, during my time
here, pulled the ﬁnancial mg out
from under any student. ever,” Lin-
coln said.

“The problem,“ said Hopkins, “is
that most children are not apprised
of their family’s ﬁnancial situation.”
Changes in aid occur because of
changes in a family's ﬁnancial situ-
ation, but most dependents have no
idea what their family‘s ﬁnances are
like and don’t understand the
changes, Hopkins said.

9 percent nationwide this year. “I

can’texplain it." Lincoln said. ”Each
year the ﬁnancial aid budget goes up
but costs go up even higher. Ideally,
I‘d like to see a balance," he said.

Hopkins pointed to items such as
printing costs, which rose between
IO and 15 percent this year. He also
noted that universities such as Stan—
ford, which last year raised costs
over 18 percent, only worsen the
prestige-pricing phenomenon. Car-
leton and Wesleyan recently an-
nounced that their admissions deci-
sions would be based in parton stu-
dents’ ability to pay. Hopkins called
such actions “unconscionable.”

Occurring simultaneously with
rising college costs, the Justice De-
partment‘sinvestigationcould spark
a price revolt among parents. Such a
revolt would be “detrimental to
higher education,” Hopkins said.

Because of such a possible im-
pact, both Hopkins and Lincoln
agreed that the Justice Department
investigation should be followed
closely.

NEW BILL OF RIGHTS

 

Continued from p. 6

documentisaprohibition: Congress
shall not raise standing armies, nor
createlegislationsupponinganarmy
for more than two years in peace-
time. It was not the intent of the
framers to have standing armiﬂ. thus
militias were needed. As we now
possess one of the most powerful
armies in the world. the militias are
no longer necessary, nor is the right
of any citizen to buy an AK-47.
This conflicts, however, with
ArticleTwoofournewConstitution:
The right to lethal force shall be
protected under the law; use of said

force in protecting property shall

not be restricted.

This leads into the third and most
dangerous ﬂaw in administration
rhetoric and policy: the belief thatall
dilemmas can be solved through
force. Notall conﬂicts are zero-sum
games, nor are all lines in “the drug
war" clearly drawn. The combatant
mentality totally rules out compro»
mise anddialogue, and misleads one
to think that there is an absolutely
right position.

It is with this self-righteousness
and willful narrowness of vision that
hasledtothegreatttagediesofhuman
history; let’s not perpetrate another
one.

agreed to have a college ﬂoat in this year’s

THE REAL CONFLICT

Continued from p. 6

settled and given equal rights.

In America, the image of the con-
ﬂict in the Middle East has been
relegated to one between Israel and
the Palestinians. We disregard the
more prevalent themes of violence
and hatred dominating the Arab
world, whose effects all too often
fall on the shoulders of Israel. In-
deed, while the vastmajority of Arab
nations cannot agree on anything
and are continuously at war, they all
can agree upon one thinggtomake
the Middle East Israel-free.

The last 40 years have been like
onecontinuousbattleforthelsraelis,
who have tried to maintain ademoc-
racy in a region nrled by egotistical
dictators. Israel and the Jews must
learn from their history.

No longer is Israel willing to give
up sectue borders and risk Israeli
blood for ambiguous and all-too-
often broken promises of peace.
Unfonunately,thePalestinianshave
also been victimized by the selﬁsh
ness and ruthlessness of their Arab
neighbors and the PLO.

Originally called upon to evacu-
ate Israel by Jordan, Egypt, Syria.
Lebanon,lraqandSaudiArabia,who
wanted to “clean up the area” — a
euphemism for ridding the Middle
East of Israel and Jews—the Pales-
tinians' brothers in 1948 left them
with nothing. Rather than being al-
lowed to assimilate and short a new
life in Jordan after the 1948 war, the
Palestinians werecooped up in Arab
camps, fed on Jordanian. Egyptian
and Syrian slogans of anti-Zionism
and Jew hatred, kicked around the
Middle East and massacred at will.

TheIntifada,otiginallyaPalestin~
iansaorrltaneous outburst over their

 

cdndrtion as refugees, was capital-

ized on by Arafat and the PLO. and
isnowbeingusedasthelatutweapon
against Israel by the Arabs. Because
the impetus behind the uprising is no
longer a desire for autonomy and
peace, but rather, thanks to Arafat,
another tactic to realize pan-Arab
unity and the destruction of Israel.
the Israeli soldiers are once again in
the unfortunate position of defend-
ing not only their lives as soldiers,
butlsrael’sfturdimental r'ighttoexist.

By disregarding the
constant threats
made against Israel
we fail to address
the real issues
behind the conﬂict.

Interestingly enough, the Pales-
tinians living under Jordanian mle
also protest against their conditions.
Big brother Hussein's answer is, as
in the 1970‘s, swift and expedient~¢
only he doesn‘t allow any cameras
or reporters in to see the carnage.

Obviously, the situation in the
Middle East is complicated. Rele
gating the conﬂict to one between
Palestinian and Israeli is inappropri-
ate — both the Palestinian Arabs
and the Israeli people have suffered
considerably more at the hands of
their Arab neighbors and the PLO.
than through personal antagonisms.

By disregarding the constant
threats made against Israel and the
role of the Arab nations and P.L.O.
in supporting violence and war. we
fail to address the real issues behind
the conflict in the Middle East and
move ourselves that much further
away from a real solution.
