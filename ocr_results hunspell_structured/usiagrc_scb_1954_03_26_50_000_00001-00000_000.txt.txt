A new approach to the prob—
lem of ratification and activa-
tion of the proposed constitution
IS necessary if any part of the
proposals is to become effective
before the end of this school ,
year, members of the student
committee which drew up the

llproposals were told last night

by a reliable source in the ad‘-
ministration.

Seven students heard the
opinion, which the source em-

iiphaSlzed was strictly unofficial,

that a “phasing program" of
adoption. under which only the
central legislative body, and
possibly the judicial bodies and

'(unctions, would go into effect

upon adoption, is the only meth—
od of bringing any part of the
constitution into effect this
year.

otherwise, the source said; ne-
gotiations over particulars in the
plan will carry over through the
suummer, and begin again at the
start of the next school year.
Previously the committee had
felt that the entire structure
outlined in the proposals might
go into effec‘t upon adoption,

twith specific duties and respon-

sibilities he

gradually.

to incorporated

if the suggestions made to the
students last night are followed,
the executive council—the tent-
ral legislative «group—would be,
established immediately with
the full powers, including ap-
pointment, now held by all-
parts of student government;
and the judicial boards might
also gain immediate approval of
all necessary groups, starting to
function immediately.

Also included in the sugges-
tions was the appointment of
chairmen of the standing com-
mittees of the proposed govern-
mentiin the field of student
organizations, social activities,
budget, and communications —
so that these students might
learn the problems of their
field as student representatives
on the mumittees and boards
now carrying out responsibility
in those areas

Then, at the beginning of
next year with this part of the
Constitution in eﬁfect, the parti-
culars of power and responsibil-
ity, structure, and working pro»
eedure could be worked out for
the remainder of the proposals.

The student group made no
decision on the suggestions last
night, and has scheduled a
meeting for the evening oi
Monday, April 5, the first day
of classes after spring vacation

Approval of President Samuel
N. Stevens, the facility, and two-
thlrds each of the men students
and women students is neces-
sary for ratification of the con.
stitution.
