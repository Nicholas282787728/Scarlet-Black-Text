Polio is Costly

Tonight the men of the Honor G will collect dimes be—
tween halves of the.basketball game. This marks the open-
ing of the March of Dimes on the campus. '

The March of Dimes is set up so that half of the mon-
2y collected remains in the county from which it is contrib-
dtedi This means something in Iowa.

Iowa had the highest polio rate of any state in the na-
tion last. year. ,

Not only did it break the March of Dimes. treasury in
:his state, bllt the expenses will continue. The treatment
if post—polio cases is even more costly than treatment at
the time of illness. The five cases which took $5,000 of
Poweshiek county funds this year will take more next year
with approximately $1,000 to be spent for each new case
which will break.

The emergency funds available to local chapters will be
exhausted to the last penny by January 30, the birthday of
Franklin Roosevelt, who has inspired the drive.

When the Honor G collects dimes tonight, give as many
as you can spare. And remember all month the dime banks
distributed about campus.

'Why V Physical Training?

S & B suggests an alternate physical training program to

Would be obliged to cross to ARH.

Bravely swimming across the tennis courts, the young
men would broad jump the railroad siding, Slog through
the oozing spoils hanks, wade the uncertain rivers, and
erect pontoon bridges where needed.

This, accomplished four times a day per man, should
build a. tough, hardened, battle-ready student body by
spring.

they were pleased and happy
over their reception at Grinnell.
