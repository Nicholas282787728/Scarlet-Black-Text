('(vuxt To Continuc.

Tile Student Court will continuc to
exercise its present powcrs until some
action is taken at a mass meeting ol
the men students which will be lrcld
next Tuesday. February 14, at one
o‘clock.‘ The meeting was placed one
week later to allow discussion to
clariiy matters.

The third announcement made by the
Court expressed the attitude or that
body toward any witnesses who had
appeared belore it during the ins
vestigation, it read:

Must Not “Lassen Happiness:Y

“Any one who attempts to lessen the
happiness of any one who has testiﬁed
in the interests of student government
violates the spirit of that government,
and therefore shall he considered by
‘the Student Court unworthy oi being a
member of this college community."

The above action was taken because

the men of the student body an atti—
tude which is contrary in spirit to the
resolution presented at a recent mass
meeting of the men requesting the
Court's further handling of the case.
The testimony which the Court heard
not only conflicting, but also cons
tradictory in many instances. Evcry

effort to form a tnir judgment."

The document continued by saying
that “in How ot the attitude prevalent
among thc men or the student body re-
vealing an unwillingness to oo-operate
zilid assume, with the Court, a fztir
share or the responsibility in handling
the problems oi student conduct, we,
the members or the student Court, reel

thcrciore ieel it necessary that we be

paper was signed by all the members
oi the Court.

Tile Court was in session intermitr
tently troni ten o'clock Thursday night
until Monday, when its decision was
presented to the administration com-
inittee of the faculty.
