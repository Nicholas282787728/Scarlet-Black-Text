MUHE HELP NEEDED TO
FEED SIAHVING BELGIANS

Letter To rroiessor ruyno Says licl.
iiin~s pool is Cup oi Cocoa and
One biscuit—Tells Where
Donlllitm Has Gone.

A communication explaining the re—
liei worh which is being carried on in
Belgium has been received by Prof.
c. w. Payne. It comes authoritative—
ly trom the Commission tor Belgian
Relief itself and explains in a way
where the money which Griuuell has
donated to the work has gone.

Also the letter contains a strong an»
peal lor further tunds, presenting as
it does a situation of utmost gravity.
Pl'olessm‘ Payne [eels that Griunell
has not done her share in this move»
ment and says that he is willing to
talre charge oi any further lunds
which anyone wishes to donate, He
will accept any amount above twenty-
five cents, he says.

The letter follows:

“But the Belgian situation does call
urgently for outside help. French in-
stitutions turnish 13,750,000 trance and
the British Government 750,000 in the
form or loans to the Belgian Govern
ment, towards the loud supply for
some 7,500,000 Belgians inside the Ger-
man lines. British subjects at home
and overseas have added an average
of $500,000 monthly. The guts oi the
U. s. A. lire small in comparison, and
of a painful unccido‘ ty.

“The small daily ration given to the
totally destitute, just about tuovﬂurtls
thnt supplied in English poor-houses,
has served to keep the grown—ups in
lairly good condiljoniweakened mus-
cularly, to be sure, but comparatively
safe.

“But adolescent children cannot hold
out on this diet. Any experienced and
watchful mother, any modern teacher,
or any child specialist can tell you
something of the eflccts of under»
nourishment of children at the ages
when hone, muscle, blood, and brain
should be expanding. There Is dis-
aster of the most permanent churne-
fer.

"Scientific investigation under com—
petent physicians has demonstrated
that a supplementary meal for these
children is essential, unless we are to
see a race in which a high percentage
suriers lrom varying degrees of deli—
Ciencyibeat at the start, mentally as
well as physically.

“The supplementary meal itself con—
sists of one biscuit, about four inches
square. made with ﬂour, laid and
sweetening, and one cup at cocoa, wins
sugar and phosphatine, and with milk
when it can be hull. Where the deple—
tion calls ror modification, even of this
simple ration, the cocoa may be dilute
ed, or even, at times substituted by a
broth.

"The number or children involved
now reached something llke one and
one—quarter millio'ns, out of a total or
2,575,000 children under seventeen
years.

“The cost of assuring them this sup—
plernentary meal would he one lnillion
dollars monthly.

"This could be found in America.
But how? One hundred thousand peo—
ple at $10 per month? Two hundred
thousand at 55 a month? But howl
It all requires 'solne sudden awaken-
ing or the American people. Very
soon it may be too late."

NOTICh.

The committee on the recommend-
ation of teachers has found it advisa»
ble tD adopt the rule that in cases
where candidates who have been not-
ified of Vacancies do not report to the
Committee within three days from the
time when the notice is mailed, such
persons will not be considcl‘ed its cans
,didates', either for this particular po-
sition or any other,

Also, if there are any who desire 35A
sistahce from the committee who have
not registered yet, it is highly in]-
porlaut that they regi. 61' at once as
the committee is constantly receiving
notices of Dositluns for which they
have no one to nominate.

0f the plays to be given here, only
one, Lord Dunsnny's ‘The Gods of the
Mountain’, is in serious vein. It is a
play of highly dramatic quality and
has been acclaimed as one or the best
short dramas in . tence. The other
ofierings are comedies and the group
will lurnish the best sort of entertain-
ment.

The company is the same that has
brought success to Mr. Walker's ven-
ture in New York city, Chicago and

(Col-

exercised in its selection and it is “11*
usually well balanced, The settings
have been carelully worked out and
the lighting will be observed to be 1S
unusual as it ls novel itud interc
ing.

This attraction is worthy ol the full-
est patronage we can bestow upon it.
Everyone who has seen the Pal-tintin-
teau plays is full of enthusiasm for
them. They represent a movement in
our American theater based on sound
theatrical knowledge and lung profes-
sional experience. We are indeed for-
LullMe in being able to have this fine
band of actors bring their dramatic
wares to our doors

It. is understood that Mr. Walker
will speak Monday alternoon at. the
Quadrangle theatre at four o’clock.
followed by an informal reception, to
both of which events all persons i
ternsted are cordially invited. 1
