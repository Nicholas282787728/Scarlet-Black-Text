[f chosen to receive the grant, students
will spend a year abroad studying a

topic of personal interest

BY Dale H. MoNTGoMcnv

Grinncll has nominated four students for the prestigious
Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, out of an unusually large ap-
plicant pool on4 seniors.

Linn Davis, Sarah Fowler, Graziela Paz Arias and Lindn
sey Young, all ’08, were selected based on their project propos-
als and personal qualities.Tlicy will compete nationally for 50
$25,000 grants in a pool of 200 nominees from top colleges
Recipients use the grants to support a full year ofintcrnarional
independent study in often—esoteric areas.

Associate Director of Post-Graduate Service and Scholr
arshrps Doug cutchins ’93, who oversees Grirrncll's selection
process for the Watson, said that the fellowship was intended
to make “targeted investments" in future leaders, encouraging
them to freely explore topics of particular interest.

“You take 50 students of unusual promise and say, ‘We bet
lieve in you and rhink you're a brilliant leader in some area,’"
Cutchins said.

The most eye-carching parts of Watson applications are the
project proposalsThis years nominees propose projects such as
Fowler’s idea offollowing the production of chocolate from the
cacao bean to candy stores, or Young’s examining how ideas and
dance moves spread around different swing dancing “scenes" in
France, Sweden and Canada.

Despite the attention that the innovative projects gather,
Cutehins said that the most important thing determining
whether an application is accepted is not the project but the
candidate.

“They’re not funding projects, they're runding people;
cutchins said. “What's much more important [than finding
interesting projects] is that we nominate the right people."

The Watson Foundation looks for leadership qualities such
as creativity and courage.

Students wanting to apply for a Watson go through a care
fully structured process. They ﬁrst have to complete an applican
rion for Grinnell’s nominationiﬁve pages about the project
and five pages era personal statement,

After submitting this, the college puts all applicants through
an exhaustive interview process. Each applicant has three sepa—
rate interviews with different members of thc six-person fac-
ulty committee (this year, two alumni who had been Watson
Fellows helped out).

Following the interviews, the faculty committee debates the
applicants and decides on four nominees—sometimes a very
difficult process. “Almost everyone had at least one person on
the committee who was in favor ofnominaring that candidate,"
Cutchins said.

Curchins highlighrcd the value of the rigorous application
process in preparing students for grad school and job applican
tions, and rhis year's nominees agreed.

“The way 1 saw it was,if1 have the ability to convince three
people that] should be nominated to represent the college
then I can get a job, I can go to grad schooliit's kind of like
I'm supetgirl or whatever,” said Paz Arias.

Conference explores prison teaching

BVJAMESANTHOFER

Since the spring of2003, studenrs participating in Grin—
nell’s Prison Wriring Workshop (PVVW) have
used their time, ralcnt and energy to bring edun
cation to many underprivileged prisoners, This
weekend's first ever Prison Education Confers
encc will highlight the work of PWW and related
organizations, Opening last night with a speech
from the founder of the Bard Prison Initiative,
Max Kenner, the conference is intended to initi-
ate dialogue about the importance of programs
like PWW

For Emily Guenther '075, the leader of PViNV and an or-
ganizer of the conference, this weekend‘s events will show the
importance of prison education and forming connections with
prisoners. ““When you’re working with prisons, most ofthc stufr
gets done through personal connections with people," she said.
“It takes a while to build that relationship."

PWW focuses on student interactions with prisoners more
than any other aspect, and has kept that self-directed feel since
its conception, with students teaching rheir classes almost
entirely on their own. “The group meets pretty sporadically,
because it’s a big time commitment to teach in general," says
Guenthcr. “We have a big meeting at the beginning ofthc sen
master, and we're trying to incorporate more inectings,bcca\lse
people need to talk about their experiences "

Adam Barrett '08 found the prisoners to be surprisingly

”The guys who take the (lanes
are awesome . . they are often

really insightful and they’re all

really glad to be there.”

open and excited to learn. “The guys who take the classes are
awesome," Ban-err said, “They are often really insightful and
they're all really glad ro be there."

Barrett also stressed the important
role that prison education plays in re,
ducing recitlivisrtr rates. “Personally, I
view it as a way of reaching out to inn
elude people in the intellectual land
scape who might otherwise be lost to
the outside world," he said. “I feel like
it’s a greatway to engage their contrihun
tions and give them that opportunity to
continue developing."

Anna johnson '07, who has taught one class for PWVV, said
she hopes that the conference will give students who have not
participated in PWW the opportunity to see the importance
of prison education. “It’s the only way I see or giving people
a chance of bettering their life once they‘re out of prison,” she

said.
