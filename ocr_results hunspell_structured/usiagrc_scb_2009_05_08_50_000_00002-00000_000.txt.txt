from P- 1 Program student Coordinator. said. “Just

like Grinncll, there’s strengths and weak
nesses of every student, but everyone that goes in is really
amazed at the overall intelligence and receptiveness to this
academic program,"

Student volunteers at Newton and Mitchellville currently
teach courses on topics ranging from Theater to Gender and
Women's studies. Additionally, student volunteers provide
tutoring and run the prison library.

“one of the most amazing parts of
the program is the freedom of the student
teachers to design their own curriculum,
to teach what they're passionate about and
teach what they love," Ritter said.

“When you know something and then
be able to rearticulare it and teach it to
someone else you kind oflearn it in a dif-
fetent way again.” Emma Lawler ’09 said.

Accreditation is the culmination of a
yeat’s efforts by Guenther, as well as many
others involved with the program.

“[Gucnther] approached me last year,
about this time of the year with the hope
that it could become possible to put Grinnell courses in
Newton Correctional Facility," said Associate Dean of the
College Kathleen Skerrett, who is a faculty advisor with the
prison program.

“The ﬁrst step was to go to the president and get a pro
cess from him and the dean so we did that I guess at the
beginning of this semester,” Guenther said. “After that they
gave us process which included going to curriculum commit—
tee, going to executive council and then eventually getting a
vote on it from the faculty."

Accredited college prison programs are not a new con—
cept. According to the Graduate Center of the City Uni-
versity of New York there were over 350 college- in- prison
programs in 1982.1n the mid- -1990s, the Tough on Crime
movement led to Clinton sign the Violent Crime Control

and Law Enforcement Act, which withdrew federal funds
ing for such programs All but eight programs were scrapped
nationwide

In recent years, college prison programs have made a
comeback. one such program exists at Bard College in New
York. The Bard Prison Initiative consists of a "rigorous and
diverse liberal arts curriculum, offering both associate and
bachelor degrees" in five local prisons,

Witlt the accreditation, Grlnncll College will have the
same opportunity to extend its edu-
cational resources to the incarcerated
population.

“I see this as an authentic expression
of the mission and tradition of Grinnell
College, and that is a distinctive liberal
arts column pursued in the context of
a commitment to social justice," said
Skerrctt. “I think those two things are
what make us Grinnell."

“The actual tangible learning that
goes on—for me—inside the classroom
is really remarkable," Ritter said. “The
fact that it comes from a group of people
who are so overlooked and so forgotten really sort of—to put
it in sort of romantic terms—reinforces my faith in people,
reinforces my faith in humanity.”

But the people most impacted by the accreditation ofthe
prison program are the inmates who enroll in the classes.
“Grinnell has changed my life. I now have positive goals and
the ability to achieve them, can appreciate the beauty of the
world around me and have learned to cherish the differences
in others," an incarcerated student said.

“Not only have I given my family something to be proud
of, strengthening wounded relationships, but I’ve also learned
the social skills necessary to relate to them how important
they are to me. Grinnell has given me a gift that has posi-
tively imbued every aspect of my life. so, yes,l find it difs
ﬁcult not to cry when I discuss the program."
