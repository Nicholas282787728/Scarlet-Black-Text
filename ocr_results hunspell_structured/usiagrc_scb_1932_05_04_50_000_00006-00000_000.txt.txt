The crack Pioneer iuile relay char-
tet turned in its fastest time of the
year in winning third place honors
at the Drake relay cai ival last sat-
urday. Notre Dame won the event
with a mark of 3:191. while the
Grinnell time was close to 3:21. 1

A peculiar oddity occurred in this
race when Notre Dame, Michigan
and Grinnell fi shed one—two-thi-ee.
In the preliminaries Friday, all three
terms in the other heat had a foster
qualifying time, yet the situation was

The record-breaking performance of
Indiana’s distance medley relay team,
which established a new American
intercollegiate record is all the more
remarkable, considering the fact that
an automobile accident on the trip
here resulted in the loss of two regur
lar members of the team, Fuqlla and
I-Iornbostel. and also the fact that
Cliff Watson, stellar distance man,
was competing in the Penn steeple-
chase. :

intercollegiate meet at 440 rds in

While Hap was arranging for the
boat to be taken back to New York,
it was stolen, allegedly by one of the
officers in the crew, Flying in a
plane, Moran sighted the vessel in
British waters at Bimini, an alleged
base for rum runners. Investigation
led Moi-an to the fact that the officers

had registered the ship in his own_

name before making off with it.

Delving still deeper, the former
athlete found a secret plan had been
made by the adventurer to use the
Kingfisher in rescuing Chinese and
their hoarded gold out of Mexico.

It was planned to take the Chinese
and their money secretly from Mex—
ico by plane and transfer them to
the decks of the Kingfisher which
would convey them to the Columbia
where they are welcome at a con-
struction project. The officer who
stole the ship was accused of plot-
ting to sell gasoline and fuel at great
profit, at ports between Miami and
Mexico. He had also planned to haul
lumber for the Columbia construction
project.

Moran asked government officials
to prosecute the officer on the vessel
which was stolen.

were severely reprimanded when they
dismissed themselves from class when
the instructor was ten minutes late.

"Military Drill Required at Grinnell,"
and goes on, “All young men, without
