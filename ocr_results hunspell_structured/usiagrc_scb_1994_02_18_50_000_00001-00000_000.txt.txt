sponsor events of mutual interest and
provide a forum for discussion of issues
of mutual concern" is oneof the recom-

The group gave their final re-

needed. Theirrecornmendationsdeal
with improvements in downtown

lighting, increased awareness of the
harassment issue, funding forpolice
foot patrols downtown, keeping and
