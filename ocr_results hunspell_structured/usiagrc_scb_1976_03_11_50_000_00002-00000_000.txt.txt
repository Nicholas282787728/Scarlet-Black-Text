Flu strikes

Some students have been victims of the Victoria strain of
tlu, a spokesperson for the State Department of Health has
reported, said Irma I-Iall, administrative supervisor of the
Health Center.

A representative from the health department was on
campus last week and took throat washings and blood
samples from approximately eight students, Hall said, These
specimens showed the Victoria strain of flu present, which is
now common across the country, Hall explained.

Dean of the College Waldo Walker said the health depart-
ment reported to him last week that ten to eleven per Cent of
the student body had suffered from upper respiratory
congestion over the last several days. Walker said an
unknown student reported the Spread of the flu to a parent
who passed the word to the health department. The health
department then sent someone to investigate.

“Easily 200 people” have streamed ihrough the health
center since about February 25, Hall noted. She kept records
for the health department last week, which showed 138
students had used the center between March 2 and 8.

Most students have had similiar symptoms, including head
cold. Sore throat, cough, headache, body aches,
lightheadedness. or dizziness, she said.

Health center beds have been busy, hitting the peak with

- ten patients last Thursday, Hall reported. Some students
have lett the center "unhappy" since they were not put to
bed, but Hall said they have kept only “those mostly in need
of confinement,”

The cure is, ofcourse, aspirin, plenty of fluids, and bedrest.
Hall advised.

Vogel aims for interaction

by Elaine Ashbaugh

People interacting, com-
municating with other people have
always greatly interested John
Vogel, now in his third year on the
Grinnell College faculty. AS an
assistant professor of
mathematics, Vogel finds person-
tozperson contact very important
to his teaching method.

Vogel enjoys Grinnell’s at:
mosphere, “What i like very much
about Grinnell is the possibility of
people contact. There are quite a
number of students here who
consider me both a friend and an
instructor I like that kind of
relationship. I don’t think you can
get that at a large university.” He
adds that here there’s even a
chance tor some students to get
involved in his own family‘s ac»
thitieS,

Mathematics inspire Vogel,
Although particularly enjoying his
work With computers, he stresses
that he enjoys teaching all
mathematics. He ﬁnds the Grinnell
math department particularly
strong in the fact that all of its five
full-time instructors are capable of
teaching any of the math courses.
In fact, they rotate their course
load yearly. This rotation acts as
an intellectual stimulus, since
areas of peripheral graduate
school study must be reviewed
periodically as the rotation process
drops a new course in o professor’s
lap.

Vogel wants people to realize
that “mathematics isn't just
pushing symbols" and con-
lemplating abstract principles. He
has an urge to share his
mathematical knowledge on a
personrtoeperson level. Besides
individual help for students, he
finds that the usually small class
size at Grinnell provides a
professor-student communication
unheard of at most universities.

Believing that mathematics can
be “a useful tool in many areas,”
Vogel stresses physically oriented
problems. He enjoys applying
math to any and all possible fields,
although confessing that he is also
greatly intrigued by the type of
math which “seems to have no

justification other than in itself.”

The quantitative skills picked up
in math simply “have to be useiul
on such tests as GREs, LSATs, and
MCATs," according to Vogel, The
exposure to the conceptualization
of mathematics is useful in
developing the deductive thought
processes at anyone's mind, says
Vogel. He cited the fact that one
Grinnell math major is going on to
graduate school in psychology
while another will enter medical
school, feeling that their
mathematical backgrounds will
be of great value to their future
study,

The big payrofi in teaching
comes only once or twice a
semester, Vogel says. While in
structing, Vogel at the same time
attempts to figure out the student’s
method of thinking. When a student
doesn’t know exactly what it is he
doesn’t understand, Vogel finds his
attempts to understand their
thinking processes necessary to
finally helping them. It is at the
moment when a student's face
lights up with the realization that
he understands that Vogel finds the
greatest rewards of teaching,

In addition to his duties as an
instructor and as a member of
several committees, Vogel is also
one of the two faculty advisors of
the Grinnell College Christian
Fellowship. He feels his in-
volvement there is simply getting
“back to the whole notion of people
getting involved with people,” In
this voluntary capacity in the
Fellowship, Vogel and his wife,
Norine, try to be available to
students whenever they need them.
He shares his Christian faith
Whenever the need arises, In the
Community, Vogel also finds
himself active in the church.

Vogel spent most of his first
26 years in New York City,
Although his high school was
science oriented, he says that his
Choice to continue in the sciences
was not predetermined by this
tact, Four years at The Cooper
Union, an engineering day school
of approximately 400 students,
brought Vogel in Contact with a

theoretical, but not a real
“bridge-building" type oi
engineering Vogel regrets that
The Cooper Union, although
“comparable to Grinnell“ in some
ways, offered minimal humanities
courses and seemed to stress the
strictly scientific.

New York city’s Courant In
stitute ol Mathematical Sciences, a
very unique and quite separate
part oi New York University,
awarded Vogel with on MS. and
Ph D. after his years of study
there.

with either a career in industry"
or in teaching as the two options
available to a Ph.D.
mathematician, Vogel found
himself raced with a distinctly\
eitherror decision. His decision
against industry was basically one
against entering the aerospace
field or joining the race for the
production of a “bigger and better
bomb.”

Vogel had tutored in unr
dergraduate school as well as
taught in graduate school. En-
joying his teaching responsibilities
very much, he calls these ex- ,
pericnces his ”beginnings of
becoming a teacher." Thus, he
opted to accept a teaching position
at the University of Arizona,
although his decision to continue"
his career as an educator did not
come until he had been in Arizona
for some time.

Finding himsclr somewhaL
uncomfortable with the increasing‘
pressure on university faculty to
spend more and more time on
individual research projects, Vogel
considers himself “lucky to have
found Grinnell,” aiter three years
at Arizona.

Although Vogel says, “I don’t
think any instructor at Grinnell
ever takes it too easy. even in the
summer," Vogel is glad that his
job gives him sufficient time to be 5
with his family. Although oiten
intrigued by the idea of pursuing a‘
medical career, Vogel realizes that
it wouldlimit familial relations to a
great extent. Besides. Vogel,
confides that he’s ”surely coma
fortable in teaching."
