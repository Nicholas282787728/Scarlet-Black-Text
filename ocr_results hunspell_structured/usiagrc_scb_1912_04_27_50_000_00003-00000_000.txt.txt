‘ BY THE SPORTS SQUA’D

The Unirei 5 of Minnesota base
ball team has disbanded. Nearly all
oi the men were proic nai. iowa
has lost several of their best men for
the same reason, and the University of
Illinois team has also suiieren some
dii'lioulty with the eliglltil' .i' iiiles.

Little Jiggs Macy sprained his ankle
Thursday and will not be able to
dmm't around third base for some
time.

The class hasohall series will prob
ably start next week. The Freshmen
seem to have the call on the champion
ship, although the sci-ins will be closer
this )Giu‘ than usual.

The Giiuneli truth was oiitc Loiisirlr
eroti as tho Ilest t'intlm' path in the
state but. at present the hen truth is

in bad shape. A "t-icauup" day
might help sonic ior in this ntn tlic
iucii ot' the College Could help to res
more some ot the iniant boulders train

be donc beiore tlic State Meet.

Dope sheets have been ninth in ori-
delicc this last week. Both Juniors
and Seiiiois lime been aiiie to figure
their class as the \i'lliliels.
