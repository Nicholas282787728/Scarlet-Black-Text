Financal Plan lnterest

Music Group
Plays Sunday

Annie Tscllopp Gombosi
To Direct Ensemble
At Vespers Concert

Sunday Vespers will be a musical
program by the Grinncll string
ensemble under the direction of
Annie Tschopp Gomosi, instructor
in violin.

The program will be from the
works of Johann Sebastian Bach,
including three chorales, a con-
certo for two violins. and a
motet for five voices. The choralcs
will be sung by the Vesper choir,
accompanied by organ and strings;
Mrs, Gombosl and Margaret Batt-
es, student, will pay the concerto.
accompanied by the ensemble;
and the motet will be done by the
Vesper choir, organ and strings.

The complete program includes
the choi'ztles: “Jesu, Who Didst
Ever Love Me.” "All Glory Be to
God on High," and “Jesu, Joy of
Man's Desil' g"; a concerto for
two violin , and “Jesu, Priceless
Treasure," which will be sung by
the motet.

The words and melody of the
motet originated during the period
of the Thirty Years' War. The
significance of the text can be
fully appreciated when the back-
ground of horror and devastation
is contrasted with the joy and
peace of the soul that comes of
the faith in Christ. Bach repeats
the verses of thc Chorale in
varied form. and interpolates more
or less elaborate choruses.

Expressed By West Coast Alumni

y Clyde Bares,

“Many west coast alumni have
expressed interest in the financial
plans of Grinnell, and indications
are that these alumni will re-
spond liberally."

This is the statement of Cal-
vin Deming, director of publicity,
who returned Monday from Los
Angeles, where hc has been dis
rooting the west coast tour of
Pres. and Mrs. Samuel N. Ste-
vcns.

Deming said nothing
concerning the financial success
of the trip, stating that such in—
formation should come from Ste-
vens himself. The director of pub~
licity indicated, however, that the
trip had been a success.

Deming said that the rest of
the Stevens party would leave
Los Angcles for an Arizona trip
before they return to Crinnell
next Monday.

When the

further

president arrives

from Arizona next week, he will
have visited and addressed every

pcrt Hughes, novelist; Lawrence
Golding, one of the forcmostEng»

The trip schedule included stops

to Seattle, Wash. Deming said,
Dr. Stevens addressed alumni as-

tacterl many other speaking on»
gngements at churchcs, chambers
of commerce meetings and similar

Grillllell alarm clocks received
an early morning work-out
today, when they were its—
signed to the task of arouse
illg a Sleepyseyed student
body before 6 n. m,

The clocks did a good job, too,
for it was estimated that morc
than 400 men and women were
at the Rock Island station when
the 6:07 pulled in on time. of
the students present, it was be-
lieved that 300 were women and
the rest men,

Tmin Causes Coniusion.

No little amount of confusion
was caused when the team ems
barked rroiu one of the rear cars,
while the mob was standing on
the station platform. No one was
cnished in the dash across the
M. and St. L. tracks.

The occasion was lacking in
formality and organization, Even
Coach Ben Douglas, still wearing
his new stctson, was not called
upon by the crowd to make a
speech. Stan zahller. Jerry Fort,
Hap Kendall. Gene Peisner, and
the rest of the squad also got
away without being heard from.
Congregation Sings Alma Mater.

Fricl‘ to the arrival of the team,
an impromptu pep band kept
spir‘ts high with renditions of
various Gl'inrlell and other college
songs. As the train pulled into the
station, the entire congregation
burst out in “Sons of Old Crin-
nail,"

in the memory of A. Lowric
Erisbie. '00, of the Gnnnell Her-
ald-Register. there was never be
fore a similar demonstration of
Grinnell spirit.
