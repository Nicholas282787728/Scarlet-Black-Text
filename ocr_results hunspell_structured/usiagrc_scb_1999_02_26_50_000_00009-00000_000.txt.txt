Harp Traditions:
Celtic, Latin
American, French

Jeanmarie Chenette will present a
faculty recital entitled “Harp Tradlt
tions: Celtic, Latin American, and
French” Saturday, March 6 at 8pm.
in the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts.
She will be assisted by Kimberly
Helton, ﬂute.

The concert will explore three
mayor harping traditions ofthe trian»
gular harp, beginning with the music
of the ancient Celts. Ms. Chenette
will perform Irish and Scottish music
on the wirestrung clarsach, a small,
but sturdily built harp widi such ex-
ceptionally resonant tones that the
strings must be dampened after each
playing.

Rhythm is the key to the Latin
American harp tradition, The fast
paced Galopas and Joropos, awash in
syncopatioris, are played on the taller,
lightly strung Paraguayan harp which
has its ancestry in the harps ofSpain.

The French tradition, dating from
the isth century and extending into
the 20th, has had a profound effect
on concert harp literature, both solo
and ensemble. The music, originally
fairly straightforward and harmoni-
cally conservative, grew incomplet-
ity and color, until virtuosity became
the norm. This segment of the pro»
gram will include solo works by harp-
ist/composers Francois Joseph
Nadermarl and Matcel Tournier, and
flute/harp duos by the noted French
composers Gabriel Faure and Jacques
Ibert.

First ofall, we would like to apolo»
gize for our absence in last weeks paper.
We know mat many ofyou were disap-
pointed, but we had never even heard
of The Big On: (except die porno ver-
sion that Aaron has in hispossession).
Anyway, we are back this week with a
vengeance,

We would like to take a moment to
mourn our fallen compatriot, Gene
Siskel. He was the best there ever
was, . .Gene, we're gonna miss ya.

Considering our readers have the at—
tention spans of inﬁnis with attention
deficit disorder, we’re going to remind
them of our Mission Statement. Our
views are not doctrine, they are merely
opinions (shoddy ones at that). Don’t
get all fired up.

How The Bicycle Thief

 

M 0” WERE?

BY ANNIKA ENGINEER
StaffWriter

The ﬁrst Vagina Day was held on
February 14, I998, and demonstrated
a growing voice to end sexual violence
against women and to celebrate and
appreciate the female race. it featured

writer and activist Eve Enslct's highly .

acclaimed play, Tire Vagina Mam)-
lagttrr, and this funny, poignant drama
has become central to the shout out
against violence. A large number of
colleges and universities across the
nation contributed to the spread of
this new kind of awareness and to
makingsociety in general more com»
fortablc and more knowledgeable
about the female body and its unique
sexuality. Professor Victoria Brown is
in charge ofVagina Day here in
Gtinnell and says that she has received
a tremendous amount ofsupport not
only from Gtinnell students, but from
students across the country who sent
in e-mail voicing their enthusiasm for

.this campaign.

Seventeen Grinncll students will
be reading excerpts from Tire Vagina
Manalagucr, and the event is sched-
uled to take place on two separate dc»
casions. The first show will be held
on Thursday, March 4 at 4:l5 p.m.
and the second show will be held on
Friday, March 5. Both readings will
be performed at the Wall performance

Laurclin Muir OI is taking part
in the reading of The Vagina Mam:-
logiur and says that she got involved
because it sounded interesting, Ac-
cording to Muir, ‘penis’ has become
very acceptable in today’s society and
one is always hearing about how
things are ‘phallic.’ However, onc
hears the word ‘vagina,’ and immedi-
ately gets uncomfortable. says Muir,
“No one talks about female genitalia
but people should feel comfortable
talking about it with other women
and with men." She says that men
can look down and see their penises
but for a woman, her breasts are the
only really visible part of her sexual-
ity. Muir would like for there to be a
positive, free association with the
word ‘vagina.’ She hopes that The
Vagina Monologues will help make the
vagina more ‘cxtetnal' in order to es»
tablish a comfort level and help
women to realize that it is a signifi-
cant part ofthemselvcs.

Amy Reifer '99 says thatshe got
involved with this production as she
wanted to be part ofa theater pctfar»
mancc but didn't really have the time
for such a commitment to other pro-
ductions in the theater department.
Rcifet says that the idea ofdoing The

she had heard of its performance in

REVIEWS

never had an urge to see it.

A: I too never saw dris one. I guess
the main reason is that I saw the pre-
view four times, and felt I got a good
idea of what the film was about. It’s
done by the same writer and director as
SvulFaatl's which garnered Oscar nomi-
nations. I’d encourage you to see it, It’s
not as bad as Courtney the ice Queen
drinks.

C: Thanks, Aaron. I really enjoyed
SpulI-Imd, but I really didn’t want to go
see a movie about a4o. yearold woman
who picks up some hottie. I could
pretty much ﬁgure out rhewhole movie
from the previews, so I didn't waste my
$7.50. Cynthia Rogalin ’02 would like
me to tell you to read the book ifyou
really want to get your groove back.

New York (where she is from) and she
liked the thought of making such a
‘taboa' subiect more public and more
talked about. Like Muir, Reifcrwould
also like to see women become more
comfortable with the ,ward 'vagina,
to hear it being spoken more often and
to realize that it is an important part
of their body and not something to
be embarrassed about. “it is impor-
tant to talk about all parts of your
body without shame or humiliation
and to give more respect to your body
as awhole."

Muir thinks it is vital for women
to realize the power and validity of
their own bodies and to not be scared
to unabashedly explore their own
sexuality and identity. She says, ”If

men understood what they were do. .

ing [when they assault women] and
how it affected women, maybe they
would be more hesitant before being
violent and maybe women would be
less hesitant to make it an “issue" and
would come forth and speak out
against ll. Professor Brown says that
Tine Vngm Monologues is, “one in a
series of wonderful productions in
Women’s History Month. Every year
lsay I’m never going to get completely
involved again and yet every year, I'm
so happy to get [the students] together
to think about the feminine condition
and therefore, the human condition.
i always enjoy the camaraderie ofthesc
events and this one is no different. It
is a joyful part of my work.”

Seating is limited, so it is probably a

smart idea to get your ticket soon.

The Opposite 0

Saturday 7:30 pm stars Christina
Ricci (of Tin/Warm Form/y bme), Lisa
Kudrow, and lvan Sergei.

Basically our movie is'about a l -
year-old girl, played by Ricci, who is
pretty messed up. She rakes refuge at
the house of her brother and his lover.
Trouble ensues, and that is all we are
going to tell you.

c: lha've to say dirt this movie was
pretty good. There were parts where it
got a little slow and I could have taken
a nap. This could have been due to the
fact that my birthday was me night be-
fore and The White House gang kept
me out pretty late. The plot was a little
twisted, but arniising to follow. Lisa
Kudrow actually had a decent role in
this movie where she was not playing
some Clluy chick, That was pretty re-
freshing.

of envious unemployed men, he accepts

japan 1984, directed by Mitsuo
Yanagimachi. Color, 120 minutes.

Himoinrri' is a mystical, erotic and
violent look at a small japanese village’s
battle against present day industrializa-
tion. Tatsuo (Kinya Kitaoji), a lumber-
jack who raises dogs, considers himself
the lover ofthc goddess of the moun—
rain.

Determined to halt construction of
a tourist park by any mcans necessary
Tatsuo realius that the solution lies in
the purifying spirit offire.

Almost ofniandedly, the ﬁlm builds
toward the “himatsuri,” a purging ofthe
evil spirits that introduces, in this case,
a shocker ofa conclusion.

Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard. Di-
rected by Charlie Chaplin.

lfyou are wondering about all the
hype surrounding Charlie Chaplin,
here'syourchance to cheekitout. Mud-
mi min is considered to be one of
Chaplin's best ﬁlms, a satirical social
commentary on modern industrializa»
tion, I can't comment on the reception
ofthis film in 19305 America, but i on
say that it is funny and still poignant in
the 1990s.

The main character is a factory
worker who has a nervous breakdown.
After being freed from his pochologi.
cally challenged state, he rccnrcis soci-
ety among the great numbers of the
unemployed. Meeting up witha beau—
tiful runaway orphan (pauiette
Goddard), the two set off for more
comical adventure. Much of this film
oomairis slapstick body humor as the
medium for Chaplins more serious eri.
tiques. special soundeifcctsare present
along with limited dialogue, but it is
overall still characterized by the styles
ofthe Silent Movie Era.
