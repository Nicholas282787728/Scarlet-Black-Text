EATING: Disorders GAY: Future of Gay Studies
Discussed in Talks J eopardized by Dissension

continued from page 5

Eating disorders are, for
womcn mostly, a way ofrcbclltng
and taking control of at least
one aspect of their own lives
while still striving for what society
wants them lobe: thin. Compul~
sive overeaters may use food to
escape from family problems or as
an outlet for ieelings of anger and
despair. .

These disorders, said Bard. are
both mind and body disorders.
People who have a “sense of self
connected to what they look like or
ought to be like", she emphasized,
are often victims of eating disor
ders.

Victims lend to overgeneralize
and catastrophize, perhaps having
thoughts such as, “I blew my diet
by eating two more handfuls of
pretzels thanl Should have. It’s the
endofthe world."Thcyoflen minie
mize lheiraccomplishments,disre-
garding "what they do and what
they‘re capable at that has to do
with things other than theirappear-
ance," explained Bard.

They also have “dichotomous,”
all-orenothing thinking, such as,
“If I don’t have complete control
over myself, I’m not in control
at all and l’m going to lose
control.”

Dichotomous thinking can be
particularly detrimental to some-
one caught in‘o bingcrandrpurgc

themselves from purging, then at

whole cycle.

The goal for these people, said
Bard, is to figure out who they are
in a way “that has less to do with
appearance and more with what's
inside."

If they don't take risks. they
can‘t grow and develop, and, she
added, “they don’t know they can
fail and survive."

ear emphasis to his drawings, and
he achieves a ﬂuid use of line in
describing form. In his series on»
titled “Icon," he conveys a forceful
and expressivequality to hissharply
defined features. Although the
composition of his collage, ”Ad~
venisement,“ is somewhat awk-
wardly arranged, in “Projection"
he is able to better integrate the
pasted materials into his drawing.
There is also a heightened sense of
depth in this work, which deals
with the commercialization of the
pornographic image.

This same man talked of an
institutionalized homosexual
relationshipbetwcenmcnandboys
in a society he studied, and then
mentioned that he had participated
in sexual relationships with these
boys. Thisincidenlalcommentwas
controversial for it seemed to
corroborate the virulent
homophobic standard that gay men
are all child molesters.

An increasingly common,
poignant aspect to these gay
conferences, I teamed, is checking
up on men who are sick and dying
ofAIDS. llrstenedastwospcakers
discussed seeing a person with
AIDS who looked much worscthan
he had several months before at
another conference. One of the
men said thathehadn’tscenacenain
regularattendantatgayconferenccs

across the United States.

His rncrid replied that this man
had recently died of complications
from AIDS, another loss to the gay
academiccommunity. Gaystudies,
arelnu‘velyyoungdisctpline,isnow
being decimated by the deaths of
many prominent gay writers and
researchers in their prime.

I left before the final session at
the conference which was slated to
discuss the direction of gay studies
in the 1990's. Apparently,
according to the report ofa friend,
thesession becameahugeslanging
match, with recriminations about
the organization and content at the
conIerence. My friend said that
people were so disillusioned by the
disharmony and hostility among
different groups and interests that
many attendants said they would
notretum. Withoutharmony anda
common objective, and beset by

divisions, personal quibbles, and
theenormityofAlDS,thcprcspccts
for gay studies are currently bleak.

Yet I do not think that this
conference will signal the demise
ofgay studies. Instead there will be
new avenues and players in the
studies arena. I believe lesbians
and bisexuals will come in to be a
more active and powerful voice in
gay studies, and their contributions
will shape its directions in the
1990‘s. I think the power and
enthusiasm of young groups such
as Queer Nation and Act Up, the
sameontzstheoncauthordismissed
derisivcly,willleadtoaresurgence
and new direction for gay studies.
It will probably usher in a more
balanced gay studies which does
not rely so much on traditional
‘stuffy‘ academic approaches but
incorporates theconcemsofallgay
people.

currence," he said. “In my book, I
deal with it very marginally." He
added that Neitzsche himself did
not appear to see this as a central
theory, citing as evidence his fails
urc to publish most of his notes on
the subject himself.

“I would guess,just making up
numbers, that90 percentof what is
said about the eternal recurrence
appears in unpublished notes.” He
added that most of what is said
appears in one of Neitzschc‘s most
famous works, Thus spake
Zarathustra, which he sees as more
ofa parable than anything else.

This book, covering as it does
two of Schrift's closest interests, is
the fruit of years of study of
NeiLszche and interpretation theory
dating back to his graduate school
days. But for the United States in
general, it is a relatively new ﬁeld.

According to Schn'ft, Neitzsche
was not widely studied in America
until the 1960's.

Scholars in the United States
were thus late in joining “the pan-
thcon of 20th century thought” that
has given so much time to re»
searching Neitzschian theories.

Schriftalsoremtukedon thehugc
variety of interpretations of
Neitzsche’s theories. Neitzschehas
been used as sclfrjustifcation by a
wide range of people from the Na-
zis,who tried tointcrpretitas being
in favor of German nationalism, to
humanist philosophers.
