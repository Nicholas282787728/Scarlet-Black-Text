They attack the government as well
as the typical ‘White American
Male—intelligently. This isn’t

are books like The Sexual Politics of
Meat, Frt'L'idly Fascism, Diet For A
New America. and guest rappers such
as Paris.

After listening to their first LP
release, The Myth OfRoclt, they be-
came one of my favorite bands. I feel
that C onsotidazod is currently one of
the top five bands in the world. It is
an inspiring project that continually
amazes me—particularly their intelr
lectual attacks on the fundamentals
of American society. This is a band
for people who are dissatisfied with
our culture and need to find a voice
for this dissatisfaction

When I was in London last se-
mester I altondeda C onrotidated con-

krieg of emotion. Deft samplers,

Consolidated incorporates everything
from Thislr Spinal Tap quotes to San
Francisco bus signals into their songs.
They include a provocative video
display to further the impactof their
message. They don’t strictly stick to
rap, either, as testified by the
chomping guitars of the gdyrpositive
“Accept Me For What I Am."

An interesting aspect of Con-
solidatcdconcerts is their ‘open mike’
sessions afterwards. Here, fans may
comment on any of the themes that
Consolidated addresses or may bring
upanything thatthey wish to discuss.
As one may expect. these often be—
come quite heated debates.

I (being on KDIC staff) con-
L’ithd Conrolidazed‘srepresentativcs
and established an interview with the
band to be held on March 5th during
Adam Kashuba’s techno rave show.
My show (8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Fri-
days) will feature Consolidated this
week and next. They will be playing
atGrinncll College on March 6. The
opening acts are the Goals and the
New F art Automatic Daﬂodils.

from different pcrsepectives and tak

”The basic characteristic of my
work right now is that it is figurative
or representational,” Lari said. She

has also been experimenting with
color and texture.

Lari is very dedicated and fo-
cused on her art, but planning for
future exhibits is not her main prior-
ity. She has already had exhibits at
the University of Iowa and at the

MacNider Institute in Mason City.
After graduation, Lari plans to wait
one year before attending graduate
school, where she wants to shift the
focus of her academic pursuits from
art history to studio art. She hopes to
spend a ninth semester at Grinnell.
