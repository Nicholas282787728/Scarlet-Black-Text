Fortgme lauds
Grinnell College’s
financial Wizardry

by Jeanette Mulcahy

“Grinnell College has always
been a little improbable:Y begins a
recent article in Fortune magazine
commending the college tor its
financial adroitness.

The article, entitled “A Small
College Scores Big in the In-
vestment Game,” appeared in the
December 18. 1978 issue of the
financial magazine.

THE COLLEGE'S speculative
success stems from the daring
nature of its investments.
“Grinnell employed investment
strategies and ventured into en»
terprises that educational inn
stitutions normally shun,” the
article states. It cites the college’s
purchase ol a Dayton. Ohio,
television station and its large
investment in the Intel cor»
poration as examples.

These investments, among
others, have doubled the en»
dowment fund in the past live
years to a conservative value of
$37.5 mi im‘ The college receives
an estimateu 16.2 per cent total
return on its assets annually.

TWO TRUSTEES. Warren
Buffettlan Omaha investor) and
Joseph Rosenfield, ‘25, ot Des
Moines are largely responsible for
the college's investment success

Rosenfield first joined the Board
in 1941, At that time. the value of
Grinnell's endowment was worth
about $1 million. During the '50's
the endowment increased to about
312 million, due largely to
donations from oilmarl Fred
Darby. the Ford Foundation, and
the college’s own fund drive
Rosenfield contributed heaVily
‘ to the drive.

VIOS'i OF Rosen'ield’s um,
tributicns to the college have been
-laced in the I F Pose‘ntirtd

Fund, from which money tor
Buffelt’s and Rosentleld's Creative
investments was often drawn.

Buffett and Rosenfield felt that
the fund would not yield very much
if it was put in traditional bluerchip
investments Their tirst “spec
tacularly successful” investment
was in Intelr a semiconductor
memory chip company founded by
Robert N, Noyce (another Grillnell
trustee and alumnus), The college
bought $300,000 in convert‘ble
bonds which eventually lncre’ ed
46 times in value. Grinnell has
since sold most of its Intel in»
vestment for a profit of about $12
million.

IN 1976 Rosenfield and Bullett
scored again, Buffett learned that
because of financial problems,
Avco Corporation was Selling its
TV stations. He offered $12.9
million—a bargain tor a station
that could have sold for ninth
more. WDTN of Dayton ex 2
revenues of $9 million this ,r ‘
and has a market value of about
$35 million.

since WDTN accounts for nearly
half of the endowment, critics of
the Rosenfield and Buffett in»
vestment policies express 'aars
about the investments imbalance,
While Buffett admits to Fortune
that there may be a day when the
station's worth decreases, he still
feels that at this time it is an eXr
cellent investment for Grinnell

According to Fortune most-
colleges and universuies pursue
more conservative and less suc
cessful investment policies with
their endowments Buffett and
Rosenficld feel. however, that

O Neil firm examines Mears

by Debbie Weiner

Architect Eugene O’Neil of ‘,
Wondburn and O'Neil. the firm 1
which is presently renovating me l
college dormitories and will also l
renovate and add a fourth floor to
Norris hall, has Finished his study
of Mears Cottage and its suitability
for renovation,

His report essentmlly conlirms
the observations made by Bauer
and Associates their 1977
housing study. ,

“OWEVEK, WHEREAS the
Dober report recommends that
Mears not be torn down, O'Neil‘s
report “is clearly pretty
pessimistic,” according to Vice-
Provost Ken Browning.

Like the Uober study, o‘Neil's
study points out that Meals is
”inherently combustible," and has
problems with wiring and
masonry. O'Neil puts the cost of
renovation at $950,000, comparable
to quer's m7 ligure of swam.

BUT THE DOBER report can
eludes that “Rehabilitation will
cost roughly the same amount as
new construction," while O’Neil
believes, “It would be Significantly
less costly, and in the long run
superior, to demolish the building,
and replace it with a new fire
resistant structure,"

O’Neil suggests demolishing and
recreating the building: “We Could
make measured drawings or the
existing building and its important
features. recreate the detail in an
updated and firesafe structure.
and continue the image of the
building. We could also suggest a
new Mears l-lall image, in keeping
with the philosophy oi the existing
building.” The building could be
recreated for $730,000, he says,

THE TWO STUDIES differ in
their estimations of the intrinsic
Worth of Mears The Dober report
notes that, “While it is not a land-
mark building . Mears is a
graceful building and appears to be
unique in style in the Gi‘innell area
. , . The fact remains that Mears is

O'Neil concludes, “The visual
assets of Mears Hall include
image it give. the campus = a
setting. the beautiful ﬁreplaces
in the loungcsc the charm of the
open wood st r\\‘-’i\,’. and me

residential scale and atmosphere. 1

There is almost an 'old fraternily‘

there.”

O'NEIL’S REPORT says nothing
about converting Mears to another
use

em i .

President A. Richard Turner
says the study was com-
missioned by the college ”as a
check on Dober.” He admits that
O’Neil is not an expert in the
renovation or restoration of old

buildings, but states that. “This is i

not an aesthetic problem We’re
asking him. ‘What is the condition
of the building?’ "

O'NEIL WAS called in strictly to
advis about the costs and
feasibility of renovating Mears.
Turner adds that there is “no
point" in carrying out further

Browning concurs, “I don't think
we'd learn a lot more about cost
information" from other sources].
he states. “I tend to think that
'0'. eil knows enough about
buildings.” O’Neil was selected for
the study, according to Browning,
because he is familiar with the
campus. "O’Neil has been doing {I
lot of work for us," he states
Turner adds, “He does un~
derstand the architecture here, the
people here,” He believes O‘Neil is

recent complaints by members of
the campus community that
O'Neil's firm has been responsible
for undesirable structures on

and Ken Yordon

Joint Board passed by voice vote Wednesday a
motion to lreeze all payments ot hall tunds unless
those payments are approved in writing by both the
hall rep or coordinator and the SGA treasurer,

The present Office of Student Affairs policy
allows the Office to take money from a hall's funds
loefore notifying the hall rep when fines are leveled
against a hall for damage. According to Assistant
Student Coordinator Harvey Leif, last year the
Office would inform the hall before the money was
taken,

THE PASSAGE followed the defeat of Younker
hall rep Pete Blonsky’s motion that Joint Board pay
a 3175 line against Youliker Hall for damage to a
music department piano. The piano, which was
used for occasional Mirecourt Trio concerts in the
dorm. was damaged two weeks ago.

The person or persons responsible for the damage
to the piano have not been found, According to
Blonsky. no one is even sure that a student is
responsible, He notes that all of the locks on the
dorm's outside doors are broken and have been for
several weeks. despite his repeated ellorts to get
them fixed

ASSISTANT DEAR Susie Wiltpenn Of the Office of
Student At ”IrS atlennec ihc eeting to answer
quesriohs uuo tlle Ufftce's on She stated the
llall is responsible tor the damage whether or not it
sanctloned the evenl that led to the damage.

Some reps painted out that in this case the piano

hall given permission to keep the piano in the hall.
Wittpenn made no response to this point.

JOINT BOARD rejected Blonsky’s proposal in a
4712 vote. SGA president Greg Youtz comments,
”Now it’s up to Younker whether they leel it‘s fair
to pay. I’m trankly not quite sure what we’ll do next.
We’ll have to look through the Constitution to see
what is the best route.”

This will be one of several holdover problems that
will face Greg Youtz and the rest of SGA next
semester. Other priorities for Youtz include student
EPC‘S. the bathroom policy and problems With
increased vandalism on campus.

ACCORDING TO YOUTZ, the Curriculum
Council has only vague guidelines for EPC’S. In
some cases, he feels, the EPC'S did “nothing more
than provide a tree source ol labor to the depart»
ment." Next semester he htipes the Council will
form “guidelines and minimum standards for in-
volvement of all EPC‘s."

In answer to complaints that the increase in
campus vandalism is caused by a lack of dorm
leadership. Youtz wants to return the hall reps to
"lheir preiious roles as major links between the
SGA and the hall residents,”

Youtz outlines two new areas in which he hopes to
move First, he wants to create a Committee on
Corporate Responsibility to monitor student in-
lerests in college investments. Second. changes in
the student services provided by the Health Center
are being contemplated
