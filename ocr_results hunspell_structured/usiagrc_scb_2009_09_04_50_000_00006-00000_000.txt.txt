Student cyclistsfatce legal pitfalls

Grinnell students notice increased enforcement of bicycle-related infractions as police respond to safety concerns

For many students at Grinnell, riding a bicycle is a daily
activity. Whether coming or going from class, iiding dowir
town, or enjoying the autumn weather, bikes share the roads
with cats and the sidewalks with pedestrians. Howevei, iid'
ing one’s bike may have unexpected legal tepetcussions.

For Kate Baumgattnet '11, such
repercussions became quickly appars
ent late one evening last November.
“I was walking my bilte next to my
friend and 1 got lazy and decided
to ride next to her," Baumgartner
said. The two were on the side of
the street, because the road had no
sidewalk. “I didn't have my head
lamp with me and not more than 15
seconds after I got on my bike a cop
pulled up behind us and turned on
his lights," Baumgartner said. She
was pulled over and let offwith only
a warning, but the ticket for biking
without apptoptiate illuminarion could cost up to $70.

With a seemingly heightened number of students
stopped while riding their bikes, many were curious as to
whether this was simply cotnCIdence or if the police were
truly enforcing bicycle policies for the college.

“Recently, we’ve been getting increased complaints about
bicycles on the sidewalks in the downtown area," Grinnell
police chief Jody Matherly said. The downtown area of
Gtinnell is deﬁned from 6th Avenue to 3rd Avenue and
from West Street to State Street. “You can ride on sides
walks anywhere in Grinnell except in the downtown area,"
Matherly said.

Although Iowa state law does not requite cyclists to wear
helmets, it does mandate headlight use at night as well as
prohibiting cycling on sidewalks. These laws are intended
to protect pedestrians, drivers and the cyclists themselves.
Perhaps one of the larger concerns for both students and
police involves biking while intoxicated. Many students ride
their bikes offcampiis for house parties, then ride home late
at night after drinking. Ifthe student
is stopped, they will not ieccive a
DUI, but will be charged with public
intoxication and n misdcrncanor,just
as one would if walking while drunk.

Conversely, some studcnts have
been stopped for unclear reasons,
Max Eulgoni '12, is one such person.
“I was coming out of WalMart and
ciosscd the street when it was clear.
I looked behind me and there was a
policeman with his lights ﬂashing.
When he finally pulled me over I
felt kind of silly because I was on a
bike and he was in an SUV." After
the initial confusion, the officer simply cautioned Fulgoni to
be careful because “he'd seen a lot ofaccidents,"Fulgoni said.

Chief Matherly addresses the fact that police across the
state are cracking down on bikes and bikers in general, and
that Grinnell College students are not specifically targeted.
“Students are part of the community and it's consistent and
fair enforcement for everybody,"Mathetly said. He encourr
ages students who feel that they have been unjustly stopped
while biking to contact the Grinnell police with a complaint.
Therefore, the recent issue with bikes is not one particular
to Gtinnell students, but in the community as a whole. For
those who hike frequently, it is important to both be aware

For those who often ride their bikes at night, the local
bicycle store, Bikes to You, sells headlights. "You can buy a
good, basic headlight for $24.95 and it has LED lights and
batteries that last a very long time," Craig Coopei, the stor-
eownet, said. Additionally, cooper recommended a ﬂashing
taillight for night bikers. “70 percent of all bike accidents
happen from behind. If you’re going out at night, it's a re-
ally good way to make sure no one's going to tun ovet you,"
Cooper said
