G 'miell’s speedy little for
Ward, Paul Patterson.

His record for the first nine
games of the season consists of
36 field goals and 18 free throws
for a total of 90 points. Co-cap-
tsin Gene Peisner, veteran for-
ward, and Harold Kendall, rogu-
lar guard, are running a close
race for second place in the rank-
ings. Peisner's total is 56 points,
while Kendall's sum is 52 points.
Injury Hampers Patterson.

Patterson's record would prob-
ably have been several points
higher, if he had not received his
eye injury in Monday night’s
game with Beloit. Up to that
game, he was averaging over 12
points per contest. He had made
three points before he was taken
out of the Beloit contest. Patter-
son also leads his teammates
with the best percentage on his
shots. Out of 98 shots at the
basket, he has scored 36 field
goals to give him a percentage

BARTLING & NUCKOLLS

By Clyde Bates

Roman rabble really had a big
evening when they turned thumbs
clown at gladiator combats and
gave a Iran or two a good Chris.
tian meal. Spiking a talralld-a-
halt biill wrtli a tin sword is
Mexico‘s idea of grand sport, and
there are African tribes who think
that hunting heads is toprflight
entertainment.

But here at Gniinell a new form
of the old sport has gained ins
stant popularity. This is “referee-
baiting," and a better sample of
ths activity than that shown at
the GriiinelI-Beloit game Mori-
day would be hard to find,
At the opening or the
half, the balcony crew, hanging
over the top rail like crows,
picked their man and sharpened
their knives Opening up slowly,
they sniped their choice official
with rather mild epithets such as,
“robber," and synonymous terms.
When the cage performers went
into their elbow routine, and the
refer. hesitated with his de-
cision, the upper tier really went
to work on their victim. His hand
signals for traveling began to
look like a six—day bicycle race.
But it was when the game had
but a few minutes more to go
that the heaviest barrage was
laid down by the upper—deck corps
of “referee-ribbers.” Every offi.
cial conference on the floor called
for hoarse remarks bawled from
the balcony. Jeers, cat-calls, and
boos shook the rafters of the old—
est gymnasium west of the Missis-
sippi (to coin a phrase).
The rules are simple, and there
are no fees.

Grinnell, Coe
Tie for Lead

In Conference

Grinhell and One share top
honors in the Miduest con-
ference basketball l‘acc, each
llzwing five wins and one loss
to their credit.

Lawrence is close on their heels
with four wins and one loss; and
Carleton and Monmouth are tied
for next position, Cornell, the
only conference team that has
defeated tlic Pioneers so far this
season, is in the collar with two
wins in seven games
Coe Topples Beloit, 46-35.

Coe stayed in first place run-
ning Saturday night when they
toppled the Beloit cagers, 46-38.
The Blue Dcwls came close to
regaining that lost game Monday
night when they clashed with the
Pioneers here.

The Grinnoll five were in com-
mand throughout the first half
of the contest, but Beloit held
them scoreless for the first ten
minutes of the’second half and
then allowed them only three
field goals. The Pioneers clung
to their everanarrowing lead,
however, and finished on the long
end of a 29—28 Score.

First Place Hold Insecure.

Grinnell’s right to the first
place spot in the conference is
not secure by any means. Friday
night they go to Northfield,
Minn, to meet a dangerous Carle-
ton five, Although the Pioneers

romped over the cans here by a
score of so to 37, they may find
the Northficld squad barrier to
dispose of in this second game.

If the Pioneers can subdue the
Earls, they still have return
matches with Cornell and Mon»
month, followed by first engage-
ments with Coo, Lawrence and
Ripon, defending Midwest champ-
ion, Lawrence has lost only one
in ten games, both in and out
of the conference, so far this
season; and coe is with Grinnell
in the lead.

Pattersons Loss Is Blow.

The loss of Paul Patterson,
forward and top-scorer for Grin-
llell, may seriously hinder the
Pioneers' scoring punch in the
next few games, Patterson r24
ceived a severe eye injury in
Monday night's game with Beloit
and, according to Coach B‘en
Douglas, will be out of the line-
up for at least two weeks.

These are the conference
standings at the present time:
