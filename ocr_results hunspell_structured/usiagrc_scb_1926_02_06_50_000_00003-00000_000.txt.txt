WAYNE BAHI] WHITES ﬂl
SANDBUHG’jilllﬂULN”

oriuucll instructor Tells ol‘ Poet’s
Eur-1y Lil‘e mid Litcrnry Work
In Srpicy Book Review.

Carl Sandburg, who is to appear in‘
c lecture-recital here on the evening
or March 15, is the subject or an il-
lustrated article in the February
number of the International Book Re-
view. The article is by Wayne Guru,
Grinnell instructor, and is advertised
on the cover as the magazine's leading
contribuﬁonl '

While concerned mainly with Sand-
bul‘g's biography of Abraham Lincoln,
published two days ago, the article
gives attention also to Sandburg's eel»
ly lite, his poems, and his children's
stories. The Chicugo writer is duot<
ed as ranking his stories above his
poems. " ‘The chances are’ he told
me one day, ‘that all my tree verse
will iadc out lrom human memory,
but two or three thousand yours irom
now some of the Rootahagn stories
will still be kicking along.”

In writing or the Lincoln biography,
Mr. Gord stresses the parallelism her
tween the temperaments and expel-r
lanes: of Lincoln and Sandburg, with

the inference that Sandburg is uhuS-.

ually well prepared to understand and
to interpret Lincoln. “Sandburgs big
frame and rough lectures, the grove
lines of his face and the slow, mellow
words 01 his tall-i731! suggest the
prairie statesman. It is not by ac-
cidcnt that this poet has written of
Lincoln wbct likely will stand as the
most human biography.”

 

Card's article, like one on Lew aar-
ett which he wrote for the same mag-
azine six months ago, is based largely
upon personal acquaintance with the
person described.

Taylor Takes Second
In Short Hurdle Race

Morgan Tu or, inmous Grinnell

of the Illinois Athletic club, was nos-
ed out of rust place by Wolfe. Penn-

dles at the hiillrcsc A. A. games in
New York city Fr ay night. The
race, which went in :06 6-10, was
close and Taylor was at close second.

The former Grinncu star has never
specialized in the shorter distances
and the Pioneer flash is running the
indoor lengths, getting in shape for
the ouldoor season this spring.
