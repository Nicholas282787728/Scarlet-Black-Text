A scientific breakthrough in
1989i Cold fusion becomes reality
in Utah! Welcome to the grcatttew
age, when humans have conquered
the limits of energy resources and
found a technological answer that
will provide a virtually unlimited,
polluuonrfreepowersource formil-
lions of years to come!

If cold fusion turns out to be as
' wonderful as it is touted to be, en-
ergy shortages should become a
thing of the past. Every person able
to drive can have a car of her own,
and no one will again suffer the
cold of unheated houses or the
' stuffiness of a summer without air
conditioning. Food and consumer
goods should bein plentiful supply
within a few years.
But does an unlimited energy
source mean beneﬁts to

ity and the GNP and leads to ever
expanding industrial growth. Anti
higher energy consumplion also
means faster use of other natural
resources like forests and fisheries,
whose ability to rebound is threatr
ened by present rates of exploita-
tion, and of minerals, which are
nonrenewable resources. Even if
consumptionrates remain the some,
many of the minerals essential for
industries will be gone in less than
a century.

A new energy resource gives us
no incentive to stop and wonder if
growth is always good. Is perpetr
ual progressabenefit of our current

The defense of freedom of the
press has always been affiliated
with a nice liberal ideology. A
noble ideal indeed that all persons
have the right to express their opinr
ion, adesiruble goal thatall sides of

at Grinnell College, one of Amerr

liberal ideals, freedom of the press

Censorship is such an ugly word.
It is far more desirable to silence a
dissenting voice through structural
and procedural tyranny.

This is only the internal resisr
tance to the column among the
newspaper staff, who should be the
strongestadvocales of the free press.
I have not yettouchcd on theexter-
nal resistance that appears in the
form of harassment or character-

advocacy of its removal from the

it would appear that the liberal
tdeal of the free press extends only
so far as it promotes a liberal pollu-
cal agenda. In this most excellent
example of blatant hypocrisy, dis
senting ideals may be silenced
without conscience, while at the
same time personal attacks can be
condoned and protected, thanks to
that wonderful belief in "freedom
of the press.”

It is my most Sincere hope that
maybe, if not many, then a few stu-
dents on this campus eventually
come to the realization that for the
notion of a free press to be valid at
all, it must extend equally to even
the most offense viewpoints.
Maybe someday the “open-
mindod" student body of this insti~
tution willactuallyleam fromother

But then again, that notion quite
clearly goes Against the Grain.
