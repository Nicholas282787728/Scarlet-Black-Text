The Grinnell football team lost their first home
game of the season against Lake Forest last Saturday
Although the game was close for all four quarters, the
Pioneers were ultimately unable to catch up to the

scoreless first quartei,but picked up
in rhc middle ofthe second quarter
with a Forester touchdown. Lake
Forest built on their lead with ans
other touchdown during the closing
minutes of the third quarter.
Despite the Forester’s growing
lead, the Pioneers were not discouraged. With three
seconds left in the third quarter, Marcus Plouzek Y0‘3
put the Pioneers on the board with a touchdown after
catching a eryuld pass from Sean Ptalzer '07. The
touchdown was the first and last for Grinncll during

quarter though they failed to pick up the extra point.

“We were of course disappointed with the out»
come, because we were in a position to win the game
even as late as the middle of the fourth quarter,"
explained head coach Greg Wallace. “Our inerperi-
ence on offense hurt us on several occasions when we
needed to make a play or sustain a
drive."

Although this was a loss for the

W and W W” YUP WW 0W pioneers, Wallace was cnconrrgcri

by the performances or the defense
against Lake For-csr. "Our Vdefense
played very well in the game," said
Wallace'we kept pressure on their
quarterback and took their top ice
eeiver out of the game until late in the fourth quar»
tei."

The Pioneers are still enthusiastic about their 5“,
son and they feel that with a little work they can begin
putting up wins. “We aren't that far off at this time,"
said Wallace. “But we need consistency on both sides
ofthc football.”

Consistency is exactly What the offense and dc»
fense will be working on this week. "Our focus this
week on defense is preventing the big play which has
haunted us in both losses,” said defensive coordina-
tor Tim Hollibaugh. “We are also focusing on take-
aways as a defense. If we want to help out our offense,
this is a must area ofimprovement."

On the offensive side, coordinator Jeff Pedersen
’02 said, “We have to establish a running game this
week, which \vill help open everything up for us."

The fate of the Pioneers has yet to be decided
for this season. “We are where we need to be with a
young team," said Hollibauglt, “We had our chances
the last two weekends and small things came back to
haunt us,"

“With a young team, playing mtpetience will make
us better every week,“ said Hollibaugh.

Grinnell’s nevt game will be an away game next
Saturday against Mucalester college. The Pioneers
are hoping for a repeat of last September’s 48-35 win
against the Scots, which would give them their ﬁrst
win of the season.

Tennis: Doubles practice makes perfect

EV BROCK WEBB

The women’s tennis team’s perfect season has come
to an early close.The Pioneers took their first loss of
the season on Sept. 7 against Cornell College, a ma-
jor competitor and the only other regionally ranked
team besides Grinnell. The team’s doubles strategy
just didn’t hold up against the competition and the 3,
6 loss seemed like the first signs of trouble for a team
with most ofits season ahead ofit or not.

The women quickly rebounded from their de-
feat and used the lessons they took from their match
against Cornell to shutout Illinois College and Lake
Forest with back to back 9.0 victories on Sept. 10.

The women’s tennis team began very successfully.
The Pioneers’loss against Cornell should have been a
heavy blow because it was the first loss ofthe season.
However, after losing to Cornell, the women were a
perfect example of sportsmanship. '

Rather than wallow in selfrpity, they quickly as-

sessed their weaknesses, found out what cost them the '

match and worked to correct those weaknesses before
their next games.

The'first and most obvious reason why the match
against Cornell turned against the Pioneers was their

doubles strategy. Prior to Cornell, the strategy had
been the same as the singles competition strategy,
slightly modiﬁed for the extra person on the court. If
anything, the Cornell match served as a wake-up call
for the entire team. “Many of us are singles players
and we haven‘t had very much time to work together,"
said Margaret Block ’08.

The next day at practice, Coach Barbara Waite
addressed the issue of doubles strategy, teaching the
women what they would need to know to win later in
the year during conference.

“We just can't rely on our singles skills to win done
bles matches," said Waite.

Waite has been stressing the importance of a
strong team focus on all aspects, including doubles
matches, in order to stay competitive for the confers
enee in the near future.

“There are extremely good teams out there and we
need to strive to make it to that next level of play," said
Maya Lipcrt ’09.

However, doubles strategy wasn‘t all that caused
the loss on the team's record on Wednesday. Ac-
cording to Waite, another major factor was a lack of
energy that also affected the outcome of the match

against Cornell. Waite believed that factors such as
a lack of sleep and general illness affected the teams
performance on Wednesday

Rachel Engh ’08 agreed with Waite “being men-
tally strong is just as important as being physically
strong."

The fact that the team could recognize these mar
jor obstacles early and overcome them is a testament
to their dedication to the team and their love for the
sport, The Pioneer's were able to isolate their prob
lems and work on them during their preparation for
the matches last Saturday

The Pioneers unleashed their improved doubles
strategies in their first game against Illinois College,
sweeping the match 9-0. After a short break, the tens
his team went head to head against Lake Forest, crushs
ing them with a second 9-0 victory, solidly conﬁrming
their place as the top seeded team in the conference.

The back-to-back wins on Saturday validated
the Pioneers’ new strategies and demonstrates their
dedication to improvement. With the situation under
control once again, the women are back to their usual
selves, confident and ready to prove themselves at any
time.
