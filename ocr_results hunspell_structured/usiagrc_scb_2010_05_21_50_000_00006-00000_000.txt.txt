Work like adults, play like kids

Julia Reese still takes ume out or her busy
schedule to be a kid

“I’m really thankful and really happy to
have found a group of people that I'm friends
with that will wake up in the morning and start
playing with dinosaurs, or are willing to sword
ﬁght with me on a daily basis," she said.

Student Advisor and Hall Social Coordinator.
She'll be taking these operienees with her to
Stanford Law School next fall.

“When I was ﬁve years old and most little
kids were telling their parents they wanted to
he ﬁreﬁghters ..,I told my parents I wanted to
be an attorney," Reese said,“and I've held on to
that."

Reese is considering being a legal scholar
instead ofa practicing lawyer, rhough her four
years of Mock Trial at Grinnell tempt her into
the courtroom. She is thinking about studying
constitutional law,

Before she starts at Stanford, she hopes to
ﬁnish up two proieets she's been Working on in
college. One is helping economics professor Bill
Ferguson edit a book he's writing about political
economies ﬂom a game theory perspective. The
other is publishing rhe results of mathematical
research she conduered before 11" junioryear.

Reese spent the wmmcr after her sophomore
year at the University of Georgia purring
together an equation to measure the indireer
erreets of pollurants on an ecosystem. She said
her results are somewhat controversial, because
they show pollutants aren't as dangerous as
many environmentalists have thought. She also
did research after her ﬁrst yenr,working with the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention to
study why aurisrn is often misdiagnosed.

But Reese didn't spend all of her time at
Grinnell inside. She’s been the catcher for the
softball tearn and rhis year she’s also a eaptain.
A sport that she has been playing since she was
young, it was also responsible for bringing her
many ofher closest friends.

She's not going to play eompetatiye softball
after this. but it will still he a part ofher life.

“I'll ﬁnally do my knees and ankles justice by
not playing softball any more," she said. Instead
she wants to coach a ldds’ team. She might also
play slow-pitch, every now and then.

Reese has grown up at Grinnell. She learned
to think for herself, to be conﬁdent and to be a
leader, But for Reese, growing up doesn't mean
leaving her childhood behind. “We can still
color, we can su'll play," she said.
